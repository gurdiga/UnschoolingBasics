<div id="ygrps-yiv-474219090">Hi, I&#39;m Jennifer, I have 2 kids 6 & 3.  I&#39;ve been reading here for <br/>
almost a year and have learned so much.  Most of my questions get <br/>
answered without my having to ask them, sometimes in the same day that <br/>
they come up, which is cool.  I&#39;m struggling with something now, that <br/>
I&#39;d like some perspectives on.  I used to be controling of what toys my <br/>
kids would be allowed to have and what I would buy them.  I&#39;ve let go <br/>
of that and now they&#39;re happily enjoying Barbies, Transformers, lego <br/>
etc., and I&#39;m really enjoying watching how that opens up all kinds of <br/>
worlds for them.  We&#39;re all a lot happier.  What I&#39;m struggling with <br/>
now is that they will ask several times a week to go to Target to buy <br/>
another toy.  I&#39;m feeling uncomfortable about this.  My husband and I <br/>
are restrained in our spending and will save up to buy luxuries for <br/>
ourselves.  We live in a smallish house and don&#39;t have the latest <br/>
gadgets.  I&#39;ve been trying giving the 6 year old a generous allowance, <br/>
but when he spends that he wants me to buy whatever it is he wants for <br/>
him.  Of course he sees that I always have money for food, clothes and <br/>
other things I buy for the household so it doesn&#39;t make sense to him <br/>
that he can&#39;t have what he wants too.  How do you handle this?  I&#39;m <br/>
searching for a way to talk about this with him that will make sense in <br/>
his world.  Thank you.  Jennifer</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-370515087">I&#39;m having a similar issue, but with my 3 1/2 year old.  He can&#39;t<br/>
handle waiting for things to arrive from catalogs even... cries and<br/>
cries, sometimes getting angry at me, like I&#39;m causing the item to not<br/>
be here yet.  We have been spending more and more on toys (and<br/>
especially video games) and are running out room to put things<br/>
(neither of my kids will willingly part with a toy, even if broken<br/>
beyond repair), and we simply can&#39;t afford to buy every new game or<br/>
toy.  There&#39;s never &quot;enough&quot; for him... the more we buy, the more he<br/>
wants.  I realize it&#39;s probably unrealistic for me to expect a 3 1/2<br/>
year old to understand &quot;enough.&quot;  But I&#39;m feeling very frustrated.  I<br/>
don&#39;t know how to talk to him about it.<br/>
<br/>
I have started hiding the ad flyers that come in the paper, because he<br/>
spends hours looking at them and telling me that he wants basically<br/>
every toy in them.<br/>
<br/>
I would love to provide more details, but he&#39;s on my lap, jumping off<br/>
into a basket, and climbing back up.  I&#39;m a little distracted.  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1560723694">I have had VERY similar experiences.  However, I am new to unschooling and would like some feedback on my approach to this issue.<br/>
 <br/>
My son, age 6, is constantly telling me each and every new toy that he wants and that his life will end if he doesn&#39;t have it.  At first, I felt very bothered by this and hated explaining to him (over and over again) that we didn&#39;t have the money for ___________ right now, but we would all work to save up for it.  The guilt that I felt each time I had to explain why I couldn&#39;t meet his need was overwhelming and I found myself getting very angry at him. These explanations didn&#39;t seem to slow down his &quot;begging&quot; (as I saw it at the time).  Finally, I just started asking him what he likes about said toy and what he would like to do with it.  Our simple discussion about how cool the toy is and what it can/can not do has seemed to be enough.  He does get a lot of toys (in comparison to others we know), as does his brother (1 year younger), so it is simply a matter of time (and money of course) before he gets everything he wants. I think that not only<br/>
 does he want to own these toys, but he wants to talk about them and share his excitement and plans.  I now see that he is just wanting to talk to me about whatever it is at the moment, just like I like to talk to my husband about the things I would like for around the house or the christmas presents I would like to buy for others.  The sharing is what is important, whether or not he actually gets his heart&#39;s desire at this very moment.  <br/>
 <br/>
Am I handling this in the correct, relationship-strengthening unschooling manner?  Any thoughts would be wonderful! Thanks!<br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re right, the problem is that it doesn&#39;t make sense to him - <br/>
there seems to be all this money being spent, why does he only get <br/>
what he gets? and then why can&#39;t you just buy things for him when he <br/>
runs out? He needs help understanding family finances and how that <br/>
relates to him. How to help him understand... that&#39;s going to depend <br/>
a whole lot on his personality, how he likes to learn about things, <br/>
and his interest level. <br/>
<br/>
Mo just turned 7, and isn&#39;t much interested in the complexity and <br/>
nuances of our family finances - mostly she wants to know what the <br/>
budget is when we go to the store, and how much of that <br/>
is &quot;available&quot;. We&#39;ve been talking about that consistently for a few <br/>
years, now, so she has the idea of a budget and how we all decide <br/>
where to allocate funds. She&#39;s also been a part of the allocation <br/>
process in simple, direct ways - &quot;Hey this cereal is on sale, if we <br/>
get it instead of the usual we&#39;ll have a few more dollars for toys&quot; <br/>
is one kind of example. Another is &quot;Oh, that toy is eight dollars <br/>
and I only have six... but I guess I don&#39;t need all these cinnamon <br/>
scented candles, if I put all but one back that will give us the <br/>
difference.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
With Ray we tend to talk about finances on a broader scale. He <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to know all the gritty details of our debts and <br/>
financial woes, but we let him know how we&#39;re doing financially and <br/>
how much discretionary money is available for the family as a whole. <br/>
How that money is spent is something that&#39;s decided on a family <br/>
level - it might be divided or spent on something for the whole <br/>
family. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;ve been trying giving the 6 year old a generous allowance<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Saying &quot;generous&quot; implies an expectation of gratitude. Its useful to <br/>
be aware of those kinds of expectations - especially if they are <br/>
lurking below the surface of awareness. On some level you expect him <br/>
to be happy (or at least okay) with the amount you&#39;ve decided upon. <br/>
That&#39;s not necessarily a reasonable expectation - he doesn&#39;t know a <br/>
whole lot about the realities of where money comes from or goes to. <br/>
Working toward making family finances more transparent to him will <br/>
help him develop some understanding of the household economics and <br/>
how they relate to him. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;My husband and I <br/>
&gt; are restrained in our spending and will save up to buy luxuries <br/>
 </span></blockquote>for <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I found it helpful to shift my thinking away from comparing my <br/>
spending habits and my kids&#39; to thinking about the deep, gut-level <br/>
reasoning behind the way I choose to budget. On that note, what does <br/>
buying luxuries do for you on a personal level? Does it make you <br/>
feel cared for? Like you have all you want in the world (even for a <br/>
moment)? Consider that your kids might be looking to meet similar <br/>
needs, just in different ways. They might *always* choose to meet <br/>
their needs for self-care and abundance in ways different from <br/>
yours, or that might be something that changes with maturity. You <br/>
don&#39;t know. So rather than insisting they follow your path to <br/>
feelings of care and plenty, support their own attempts to meet <br/>
those needs right now, and look for other ways to help them meet <br/>
those needs. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also found it helpful, time and time again, to think about my <br/>
principles and how I wanted to express those - in whatever area of <br/>
my life I see conflict. So maybe you feel your spending <br/>
is &quot;restrained&quot; - but that may be coming across to your 6yo as <br/>
stinginess. Is that the kind of principle you&#39;re trying to convey? I <br/>
like to actively look for ways to express kindness and generosity to <br/>
my kids - ways that *they* can clearly see in the moment.<br/>
<br/>
Now, all this may sound like I&#39;m saying &quot;get your butt in the car <br/>
and buy another Transformer!&quot; which isn&#39;t *necessarily* the case ;) <br/>
In the shorter run it may help the whole family if you can dip <br/>
deeper into the wells of kindness and re-do the budget with more kid-<br/>
spending in mind. In the longer run, I think you&#39;ll find that <br/>
bringing the kids more into the process of talking and thinking <br/>
about finances and how they are spent will help.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-335687118">Hello~<br/>
<br/>
I have been lurking for sometime now and I just want to say a BIG Thank You!<br/>
I have learned so much!  You are all so generous with your time and<br/>
thoughtful responses...it is very comforting to know this community exists!<br/>
I was more than thrilled to find you.<br/>
<br/>
Since this is my first time posting I want to quickly introduce myself.  I<br/>
am a wife to my DH and mom to two wonderful (never schooled!!) kids....DS<br/>
(4) & DD (2).  We are so thrilled with every aspect of unschooling!!  I find<br/>
myself wanting to shout from the roof tops how wonderful an unschooling life<br/>
is :)<br/>
<br/>
A little background before my question:  my family is surrounded by<br/>
water...meaning...we live on a lake, my parents live on a lake, my in-laws<br/>
have an indoor pool...everywhere my children spend a significant amount of<br/>
time they are surrounded by water!  We love(!) the water and all the<br/>
activities that go with water.  That being said, I have to admit when my DS<br/>
was born I did have a strong feelings that he would *need* swimming<br/>
instruction for safety reasons.  Thankfully, I have resisted the urge to<br/>
push swimming lessons, realizing that it was my own contrived fears and not<br/>
my DS.  What has resulted is my DS has been *teaching* himself water<br/>
skills¹ such as floating on his back, holding his breathe underwater, and<br/>
actually swimming!!<br/>
<br/>
Today I received an email from my cousin (who has good intentions) with two<br/>
video attachments for a safety swim technique (I have attached them below).<br/>
The safety video shows a specific technique teaching infants/children to<br/>
roll onto their back and float to survive a fall into a swimming pool or<br/>
deep water.  The second video is the Today Show interviewing the creator of<br/>
this technique.  I admit I was intrigued by what I saw yet conflicted at<br/>
what the process would be for a child to learn such a technique.  Of course,<br/>
I would find comfort knowing that my children could survive a fall into deep<br/>
water....who wouldn¹t?!?  But I am very interested in an unschoolers view.<br/>
Is this similar to a helmet or no helmet when biking discussion??  Would an<br/>
unschooler consider this for their child for safety??  Why or why not??<br/>

<br/>
I live in Florida, where drowning deaths are touted as being a huge concern.  I unfortunately enrolled my son in a drowning prevention class when he was an infant.  I regret having done it and I would never recommend it to anyone.  I have a friend who <br/>
feels the same way...and they have a swimming pool.<br/>
<br/>
I believe it goes against unschooling as it forces a child to do something that is against most human nature.  Who would willingly go into the water when they cannot swim?  <br/>
<br/>
A child that young has no say in the matter, and it was obviously distressing to the ones I saw.  <br/>
<br/>
My son now loves the water and can swim fairly well...by choice.  He wanted to swim, he wanted us to show him.  But, there was fear we had to overcome, and I believe it stemmed from that class.<br/>
<br/>
The class calls upon the fear of parents, esp those living near water.  Keep an incredibly close eye on them, do your best to ensure their safety, and swim with them, making it fun.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1291090637">We have always written down what the kids wanted. We bring pen and paper<br/>
with us on the rare excursion to a store. It makes the trip take longer but<br/>
it helps us. We now have a vision board to work on bring the things we<br/>

Right now we have no (zero) discretionary money. So this is especially<br/>

**********************<br/>
<br/>
This is a very important point! Its not uncommon for young children, <br/>
especially, to be satisfied in this way. <br/>
<br/>
When Mo was younger we&#39;d sometimes put everything she wanted to buy <br/>
at the store in the shopping cart and then go through later and only <br/>
buy a few things. Rather than being disappointed at buying <br/>
comparitively little, she enjoyed feeling like &quot;this is All Mine&quot; <br/>
for half an hour. Remember, to a young child, half an hour is a <br/>
looooong time!<br/>
<br/>
Something else I discovered when Mo was young, was that &quot;mommy look! <br/>
isn&#39;t this great?!&quot; didn&#39;t necessarily mean &quot;I want you to buy <br/>
this.&quot; Sometimes it meant exactly what an adult means, shopping with <br/>
a friend, saying &quot;check this out&quot;. Its just an attempt to connect, <br/>
share an interest, make conversation. If I jumped right to &quot;oh, I&#39;m <br/>
sorry, we don&#39;t have the money for that&quot; *I* was the one creating an <br/>
issue! So I learned to say &quot;oh, look at that!&quot; and make appreciative <br/>
conversation *without* being the one to bring up the topic of <br/>
purchase. And many times, the topic never came up.<br/>

This is a general comment, not related to the specific topic (or <br/>
poster!) but to the ideas in the statement above.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s possible for things to be &quot;working&quot; in a family where the kids <br/>
are just going along with what mom and dad want, because its easier <br/>
or because the kids are natural people-pleasers. That doesn&#39;t mean <br/>
parents are being respectful in the sense of striving to understand <br/>
the kids&#39; perspectives, and value those perspectives. <br/>
<br/>
Its possible for kids to be satisfied when parents have managed to <br/>
make the world small. Kids have an amazing capacity to make the best <br/>
of things! Unschooling is about making the world big and broad and <br/>
exciting for out kids - because kids want to learn about everything! <br/>
That doesn&#39;t necessarily mean travelling to China (Mo&#39;s current <br/>
favorite wish) but it does mean looking for a hundred and one ways <br/>
to meet her facination with China, even though if I dropped the <br/>
matter after one issue of National Geographic and a new cartoon <br/>
she&#39;d probably be &quot;satisfied&quot;. I know that she&#39;s not &quot;full&quot; yet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1799345346">I guess I have a different take on this.  Although I wouldn&#39;t force my child into the water, I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be against this take.  I think that we all were free floating for almost 9 <br/>
months...so it would not be all that different at 6 months outside the body. I don&#39;t think <br/>
being in the water is against human nature, it is part of it.  That being said I have 3 water <br/>
babies!!!  We all love water and when they were little they WANTED to be in the water and I <br/>
was worried because I wasn&#39;t sure I could formally &quot;teach&quot; them to swim.  I shouldn&#39;t have <br/>
worried.  They don&#39;t swim in a formal manner even now but they do understand how float, <br/>
dog paddle, swim underwater, and tread water.  Not because I taught them, they figured it <br/>
out.  They have recently asked to take swimming lessons because they are interested in <br/>
going faster in the water...lol<br/>
<br/>
When you talk about it as a &quot;drowning protection&quot; it seems mis-stated.  I watched the <br/>
videos and the instructors don&#39;t seem to be doing anything to make the children afraid of <br/>
the water or fear being in the water.  I can understand if you have a swimming pool in <br/>
your yard wanting to be sure your child is safe.  When you have multiple little ones it <br/>
seems almost impossible to watch each child 100% of the time.  If they are coming over to <br/>
play and show the child how to float in the water and the child is ok with that is that <br/>
against unschooling?  If the child isn&#39;t interested and doesn&#39;t even like to be in a bathtub <br/>
with water then you would be forcing.  Heck, I have seen fully clothed toddlers get into the <br/>
toilet, so I don&#39;t think being clothed or unclothed in a swimming pool is going to matter.<br/>
<br/>
I think my kids would have begged me to have someone come and show them more if we <br/>
had a pool and opportunity.  They have learned watching others in the water, watching <br/>
their parent swim and not having fear forced upon them (ie:  &quot;Don&#39;t jump in the deep end <br/>
you might drown&quot;, or anything that might make them afraid).  I had a sister drown at a <br/>
swimming pool (she was 6 and a half years old)...if she had known something about <br/>
floating maybe it wouldn&#39;t have happened? Either way, she obviously wanted to be in the <br/>
water but just didn&#39;t know what to do once she was there.<br/>
<br/>
If we as a family wanted a pool in our back yard I would want to at least show those <br/>
children interested how to float....but if the classes are just instilling more fear (which <br/>
from the video I didn&#39;t really get that) instead of truly helping then no they are not a good <br/>
idea.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-689870432">He gets $10/week.  I figure that way he can either buy a smallish toy <br/>
every week if that&#39;s what he wants, or save for a few weeks for <br/>
something more substantial.  I&#39;m not strict about it.  If we&#39;re <br/>
somewhere with a gift shop, or find something too good to pass up, I <br/>
haven&#39;t been making him pay me back for it.  I don&#39;t require him to <br/>
save a portion of it, or give it to charity or any of the other <br/>
things I&#39;ve heard of parents doing.  I guess the economy has me <br/>
worried and I&#39;m looking more closely at our spending and wondering if <br/>
we all need to cut back.  Jennifer<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-409147670">This is long..<br/>
<br/>
My daughter (22 months) just completed formal swim lessons. We are in Miami,<br/>
and live on the water, with a pool in our condo. She has been swimming,<br/>
playing and joyfully going under water with her parents and grandparents<br/>
since she was 2 months old. I had taught her to swim using a great book,<br/>
Teach<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9781568331829/Timmerman-Claire/How-to">http://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9781568331829/Timmerman-Claire/How-to</a><br/>
-Teach-Your-Baby-to-Swim/&gt;  Your Baby to Swim. However, Maya was never<br/>
comfortable floating, and not able to get her head above water on her own.<br/>
At 17 months she fell 5 feet off our dock and into the bay, with me standing<br/>
about 2 feet from her. Because she was so comfortable in the water, she new<br/>
how to hold her breath, and when I jumped in to retrieve her she came up<br/>
smiling, without having taken in any water. None the less, it was in the<br/>
back of my head that she would still drowned if she fell in without someone<br/>
at an arms reach..a babysitter that spaces out.an adult that slips and falls<br/>
on the pool deck.ect.(I probably have an overactive imagination). In any<br/>
case, about 2 months ago I had the opportunity to give Maya private swimming<br/>
lessons at no cost, as an acquaintance was finishing her swim teacher<br/>
training and interested in working with a child Maya&#39;s age. The classes were<br/>
10 minutes, each week day..4 to 6 weeks. This was pretty big commitment for<br/>
us, as we like to be pretty unscheduled.  Maya was thrilled to jump in with<br/>
the instructor the first day..for about 2 minutes, then decided she was<br/>
nervous and needed me. She started to cry, I demanded that the lesson be put<br/>
on hold, nursed and reassured her, and let her begin again..however she<br/>
continued to cry for the anguishing remaining 8 minutes of the lesson. I was<br/>
not allowed to join in the pool. She still eagerly went with her father or<br/>
me to the pool in our building each evening, but cried upon seeing the<br/>
lesson pool.it was horrible, but I felt important. Also, I tried to redirect<br/>
or join in the pool and was told that &quot;they don&#39;t operate that way, and<br/>
while they respected my on land parenting, I had to respect their in water<br/>
lesson style..&quot;  And then they gave me some BS behaviorist rational about<br/>
children needing forced independence..On Friday&#39;s I could join Maya, and the<br/>
difference was huge.just by my being in the water with her, even if I did<br/>
not interact with her during the lesson. (In  the last weeks, I was allowed<br/>
in the pool daily, but not to really interact with her, and she was always<br/>
smiling)<br/>
<br/>
These were 6 anguishing weeks of lessons, but I felt (like car seats and<br/>
sticking tweezers in light sockets) a non-negotiable for our family.even<br/>
though with everything else (food, bedtimes, ect..) we are totally<br/>
unschooling. In the end, I am really happy we did it, she still loves the<br/>
water..just not those people, that pool, or the specific swim diaper she had<br/>
to use for the class (they made us use disposable because it was &quot;cleaner&quot;<br/>
but one will last for at least several weeks dried nightly..just in case any<br/>
one is in a similar diaper situation). I am totally confident now that if<br/>
she fell in, she would be ok for extended periods, and could get herself to<br/>
safety. SO...in conclusion, if you are practicing RU in all aspects of<br/>
life..just have fun with your child in the pool and try to teach them the<br/>
basics..the book I recommended is great, and younger is better to start. If<br/>
you do want to do swim lessons, TRY to find a place that will let you join<br/>
your child in the pool, as I think it makes them MUCH more comfortable..good<br/>
luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-581916700">I did swimming classes with both my girls from the time they were about 9 months old. I live in Ca, and in the program I did you were REQUIRED to be in the water with your child until they were 3 years of age. It was a wonderful program and both my girls learned to swim quite well before the age of three, even diving off the diving board at 2 and a half and swimming unassisted to the side of the pool. I remember those swimming lessons as some of the best times of my life. They were both going underwater and swimming six or so feet unassisted  between the instructor and me at very young ages.....13 and 14 months,  and diving down for rings and batons and things. I can&#39;t imagine leaving a child alone with a relative stranger in a swimming lesson at 22 months old.  Sounds bizarre to me. <br/>

&gt; all your responses, stories and insight.<br/>

&gt; I asked my 4 y/o if he would be interested in watching the swim video with me<br/>
&gt; and he was excited to do so.  His response to the video was ³Mom, I can<br/>
&gt; already do what those kids are doing...wanna watch me?!².  We spent a lot of<br/>
&gt; time in the pool this past weekend and sure enough he showed me what the kids<br/>
