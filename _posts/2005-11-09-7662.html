<div id="ygrps-yiv-386064735">&lt;The other night we went to a local hair cut place because DS wanted a<br/>
trim. I was sitting nearby in case anything needed clarification (how<br/>
much to remove, etc). The beautician asked DS how old he was so he<br/>
answered 7. Then the obvious next question What grade are you in? He<br/>
said &quot;we homeschool&quot; as if that sums it all up. So she turned to me<br/>
(as we had been chatting here and there) and said &quot;So you teach him?&quot;<br/>
and I said (pleasant smile on my face, wicked grin in my mind) &quot;Nope&quot;<br/>
and she said &quot;Oh&quot; and went back to cutting hair (I could tell she was<br/>
confused). In other times and other places this usually leads to more<br/>
discussion but there just wasn&#39;t the time or interest this time.<br/>

That is great!  We have had lots of people ask our kids what grade <br/>
they are in and they just give them this blank look and then turn to <br/>
me like &quot;What grade am I supposed to be in?&quot;  I usually respond <br/>
with &quot;We don&#39;t do the grade thing.&quot;  Now that they are getting older <br/>
they know what grade they would be in if they were in school and they <br/>
usually will say &quot;If I was in public school I would be in the __ <br/>
grade.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
My oldest son was telling me last night that the parents of his two <br/>
best friends, that attend public school, have been asking him lots of <br/>
questions about unschooling.  Apparently he gives really good answers <br/>
because Kevin said that both parents wish they could have that for <br/>
their kids.  The one would unschool her daughter but the daughter <br/>
really likes her school and her friends there and can&#39;t picture what <br/>
she would do if she was home.  Says she would be bored.  Obviously <br/>
doesn&#39;t really understand that she could do ANYTHING!!  The other one <br/>
is a single mom who has to work.  I thought it was wonderful though <br/>
that the parents are so supportive of how we live and what Kevin is <br/>
doing.  They aren&#39;t your typical parents though, they aren&#39;t <br/>
controlling, coercive parents like so many.  I guess that is why Kevin <br/>
can still relate to some degree because they are really good kids that <br/>
have managed to keep their unique selves uncrushed by the public <br/>
school system.<br/>
