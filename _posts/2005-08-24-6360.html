<div id="ygrps-yiv-195491071">Rue Kream is ready to take orders for her new book. She&#39;s not <br/>
comfortable blowing her own horn, but *I* am delighted to! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Entitled _Parenting a Free Child: An Unschooled Life_, it is in a Q&A <br/>
format where Rue answers most, if not all &lt;g&gt;, of the questions we all <br/>
have heard or will hear as unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a sweet, gentle book---just like Rue! And self-published!<br/>
<br/>
I hope she will be flooded with your orders!<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s her new website to promote the book---go judge this book by its <br/>
lovely cover!  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.freechild.info/">http://www.freechild.info/</a><br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s Rue&#39;s cute little butt! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
~Kelly, tickled to death to announce this!<br/>
<br/>
Kelly Lovejoy<br/>
Conference Coordinator<br/>
Live and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1620209775">Thank you, Kelly, queen of the plug &lt;G&gt;.  And thanks so much for mentioning<br/>
my butt :o).<br/>
<br/>
If anyone wants to save on shipping you can order now and I can bring the<br/>
books to the conference.  So if any of those who have ordered already (man,<br/>
you&#39;re fast!) will be there, let me know if you&#39;d rather do it that way and<br/>
I&#39;ll refund your shipping charges.<br/>
<br/>
Now back to your regularly scheduled program.  ~Rue<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2146861888">&quot;I know you must be joking that I *might* not have posted it here! &lt;G&gt; I <br/>
posted it *everywhere!*&quot;<br/>
I knew I must have missed something!!:)<br/>
sigh...<br/>
I kinda figured you&#39;d go all out Kelly, but I just figured you were swamped with conference queen business.:)<br/>

&quot;If you hold on to the handle, she said, it&#39;s easier to maintain the illusion of control. But it&#39;s more fun if you just let the wind carry you. &quot;<br/>
