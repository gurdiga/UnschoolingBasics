<div id="ygrps-yiv-1082817309">Here&#39;s something exciting. I am exploring unschooling, and we have declared ourselves officially unschooling as of March 1st. I have been helped tremendously by Sandra Dodd&#39;s essays and by this discussion. One of my challenges has been that as a single mom, I must work part time as an ER doctor. Thus I really depend on my babysitter. I am so lucky to have a homeschooling babysitter with 4 boys who handles 7 kids at once very well. However, she has always rigidly schooled following a set curriculum.  Now (surprise) she&#39;s burning out. Her kids are burning out, arguing, often tearful. It of course causes her problems for my kids to unschool while hers feel that way. She asked to learn more about what we are doing. I felt the book which would be the most comfortable intro for her to unschooling would be Christian Unschooling, and gave her a copy yesterday. She has devoured half of it overnight, and already has excellent questions, and is remebering the old days when she had<br/>
 more fun with the (then younger) kids and did not feel pressured. Now for the problem: she has explored the idea with her husband and he is scared. He is full of all the &quot;what if&#39;s, and oh no&#39;s, and fears; to make it worse he has had some seious recent financial setbacks and really doesn&#39;t want to revamp their lives...I am aware of books by Llewellyn, Holt, Gatto, and the Colfaxes. They have just gotten their internet turned back on today, and I can recommend Sandra Dodd&#39;s websites and this discussion. But if we want to reassure a skittish spouse who is already stressed, what is the best approach? Keeping in mind that forcing him won&#39;t work any better than forcing kids, where to begin, so he doesn&#39;t try to veto it in a kneejerk way?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1590326404">I&#39;m probably not the best one to answer you about this, as we only began &quot;officially&quot; unschooling in the past year.  Well let me say, if you ask my son, he would have school no other way!  Now granted, people tell me, &quot;Of course, unschooling works for you.  Your son is gifted!&quot;  Personally, I think that&#39;s a load of balderdash.  My son (and daughter who&#39;s in ps hs) love to learn.  It never got crushed out of them.  Both my kids, research their interests<br/>
  and read all they can.  One took the private to public school path.  The other. those options, didn&#39;t work for.<br/>
   <br/>
  If your spouse has concerns, have him talk to your child about what the child is doing.  My son will tell you he hates math as he hangs upside down and does algebra in his head for fun.  (Just don&#39;t tell him it&#39;s math, lol.)  My son by age, is third grade.  The evaluator told me to skip up a few grades so he doesn&#39;t get bored.  Just to stock the shelves, I bought fifth grade books and the flash cards.  Turns out my son already knew most of them just from watching animal planet and such.  Children will learn if you make available things that intrigue their minds.   Think about what you enjoyed learning and how it made you want to learn more.  That&#39;s how children are.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Lol, my 16yo just said to her 9yo brother,&quot; Don&#39;t make me use my imagination on you.&quot;<br/>
  It&#39;s so funny because that&#39;s all she had to say to get him to giggle and leave her alone.<br/>
   <br/>
  There&#39;s no one and only path to learning.  Why fill it with tears, fights, and boring stuff?<br/>
