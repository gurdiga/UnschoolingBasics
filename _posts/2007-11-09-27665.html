  Over at Sandra Dodd&#39;s site there&#39;s an article about unschooling curriculums -- the one by Carol Narigon is great, IMO.<br/>
   <br/>
  Here&#39;s a link -- <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcuriculum">http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcuriculum</a> -- maybe with that for a guide, you could translate your daughter&#39;s days into a curriculum report of sorts.<br/>

Hey all - can anyone point me in the direction of info re: how to <br/>
document<br/>
my (15) daughter&#39;s &quot;school work&quot;? My former dh wants weekly reports and <br/>
will<br/>
not  hear of unschooling...Grace really NEEDS to deschool (she has NO <br/>
interests<br/>
right  now other than social) and decompress, and I&#39;m all for  it, but <br/>
I have<br/>
to (attempt to) please her father at the same time...any ideas?  its <br/>
not fun,<br/>
but I see no other way at this point - Todd is NOT ok with any of  <br/>
this, so I<br/>

South Carolina requires us to do this, so I&#39;m an old hand at it! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Plus, I think it&#39;s a REALLY good idea to those new to unschooling to <br/>
write down everything you do each day to get a handle on what all <br/>
constitutes learning. You&#39;ll be surprised to see how much happens in a <br/>
day!<br/>
<br/>
Mary Griffith&#39;s _The Homeschooling Handbook_ is a wonderful place to <br/>
start. When folks start unschooling in SC, I suggest both of her books <br/>
(the other one is _The Unschooling Handbook_), but the *homeschooling* <br/>
one is the most helpful in terms of writing down what&#39;s happening in <br/>
educationese.<br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s talking on the phone with her friends, consider that <br/>
storytelling and socialization. When she&#39;s IMing or emailing or <br/>
blogging or MySpacing, that&#39;s composition and computer skills. *YOU* <br/>
have to learn how  to take what she&#39;s doing and turn into into <br/>
something that looks schooly. *WE* know she&#39;s learning, but it takes <br/>
some time and skill and thought to turn it into educationese.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t tell him a thing about unschooling. I would simply submit a <br/>
weekly run-down of all the &quot;educational&quot; things she&#39;s done each week. <br/>
Conversations you have (those are the BIGGEST learning times we have <br/>
because they&#39;re asking about & learning something that&#39;s important to <br/>
them), TV shows and movis you watch, games you play, things she builds <br/>
or makes or designs, food she prepares, connections she makes. It all <br/>
counts---it&#39;s just how *you* present it.<br/>
<br/>
She needs to decompress and deschool, but that doesn&#39;t mean she stops <br/>
learning---it may mean you have to look harder though! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Give us a run-down of her typical day (detailed), and maybe we can help <br/>
you put it into an acceptable page of educationese.<br/>

Wonderful! I can do that - easily! With a little practice, that is :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Excellent. I told him we are unschooling the little kids but that Grace isn&#39;t <br/>
totally ready for that at all right now. I&#39;m not sure what he knows of that <br/>
term, and I&#39;m dropping it right.....NOW :)<br/>

&gt; That&#39;s ok by me! Worth the time, 100%.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think I might do that! I&#39;ve off-lined myself for the past 3 days and need <br/>
to catch up all over the place. Thanks, Kelly. Very much! <br/>
