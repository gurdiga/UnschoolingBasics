<div id="ygrps-yiv-1901858696">Hi, I&#39;ve been a lurker for a few years under one yahoo profile or <br/>
another; our computers die a horrible death and we forget passwords <br/>
in the time it takes us to get a new computer.  I&#39;m Dawn O., mom to <br/>
Cait (9) and Clio (7).  I&#39;ve been pursuing RU in that time, slowly <br/>
going from school-at-homer to unschooling-but-the-math-and-reading, <br/>
and finally we have let go of things including bedtimes and food.  I <br/>
don&#39;t change my ways very quickly, and as I&#39;m trying on new hats I <br/>
go back and forth between the new hat and the old one.  Eventually, <br/>
the old hat just doesn&#39;t feel right anymore and I&#39;m able to get rid <br/>
of it!<br/>
   Anyway, I decided to post today because the issue of controlling <br/>
our children is coming up more in my life; friends of mine control <br/>
their kids in ways I am uncomfortable with.  Their kids have to ask <br/>
to play video games, to go outside, to watch tv, to use the <br/>
computer, to eat, to call a friend, etc.  I was asked yesterday if I <br/>
let Cait and Clio watch whatever they want, and I said yes, pretty <br/>
much, I just like to be with them or availavle in case they have <br/>
questions about what they see (this was sparked b/c I asked one of <br/>
the kids if they had seen a particular movie I thought he&#39;d be <br/>
interested in - Aeon Flux).  When I tell them that they can watch <br/>
what they want, when they want, I felt like I was met with a silence <br/>
(could have been imagined out of fear of judgement?).<br/>
   My concern is that our culture is so control-oriented that my <br/>
friends&#39; approach to raising their kids is accepted unquestioningly <br/>
by others and supported by everyone they know (so it must be <br/>
right?), so they continue it and expect me to practice it. <br/>
Meanwhile, their kids see how my kids are treated and don&#39;t <br/>
understand why they are raised in a different way.  I understand <br/>
that the parents are only doing what they feel is right, but <br/>
consider my next concern...<br/>
   The things my friends&#39; kids say to my dd&#39;s.  One said she is not <br/>
allowed to sleep over b/c the rabbit made her sick (huh? rabbit <br/>
remained in his cage the entire time of her visit and she got sick <br/>
the day after her visit, not the day of).  Another girl told them <br/>
that her mom said Cait and Clio are spoiled brats.  ARRGH!  I do my <br/>
best not to flaunt our RUing, but you know it&#39;s visible.  <br/>
   I just feel like crying.  These are supposed to be my friends, <br/>
and are my friends, but parenting is getting in the way.  If their <br/>
kids can&#39;t be totally comfortable with us b/c of what their moms <br/>
think, and I continue to hear these things from the kids, how can we <br/>
have friendship?  I don&#39;t think the kids are making these things up, <br/>
b/c the language and tone used fit the women.  My dh is fully <br/>
supportive of RU and is the reason why we RU in the first place, but <br/>
has come out and said he doesn&#39;t understand these ladies either. I&#39;m <br/>
not sure if I want to phase out the friendships, b/c I care about <br/>
them and their kids.  They are wonderful people and do some amazing <br/>
things in their lives.  I&#39;m just feeling icky right now about the <br/>
control thing, and am looking for coping mechanisms for these times <br/>
when it rears its ugly head.<br/>
<br/>
I know this was long, but thanks for reading.  We live in an <br/>
extremely rural area and the nearest unschoolers are a couple hours&#39; <br/>
drive away, so I feel pretty disconnected most of the time.  I read <br/>
the unschoolingbasics board daily to get my doses of reaffirmation, <br/>
and appreciate you all being here!<br/>

<br/>
 Yeah---same with school. It&#39;s all accepted as normal and right.<br/>

<br/>
 Sure it is!<br/>
<br/>
 And it can get worse!<br/>
<br/>
  Cameron got a lot of this when we first pulled him out of school. His <br/>
friends&#39; parents said some pretty mean things about Cam and us that got <br/>
back to us through his friends.<br/>
<br/>
  But look at it from their point of view: they *need* to justify why <br/>
they think they *have* to do things the way they do. If *your* way is <br/>
just as valid, there&#39;s *might* be wrong. By telling their kids that <br/>
yours&#39;re spoiled or will be stupid or will never get into college, they <br/>
can justify their own choices in parenting. It makes them seem right. <br/>
&#39;Cause who wants spoiled. stupid kids who can&#39;t get into college? &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>

 I just feel like crying. These are supposed to be my friends,<br/>
 and are my friends, but parenting is getting in the way. If their<br/>

 have friendship?<br/>
<br/>
 -==-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Well, you may choose to end the friendships. Many friendships end due <br/>
to whom you marry and how you choose to rear your children. And ask <br/>
yourself, are you getting more from the relationship in other ways?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
  You could point blank ASK them. Ask them why they&#39;re choosing to <br/>
damage your relationship by making these comments.<br/>

  You bet! But you may find that those long distance meetups are more <br/>
your cup of tea. Or maybe those other folks will change their minds <br/>
after you talk with them. It&#39;s NOT easy to put up with <br/>
conventional/traditional parenting once you&#39;ve gone the other way. It <br/>
hurts to see those antagonistic relationships---and they really think <br/>
they are doing what&#39;s right TOO. Just like you do! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  All my really close friends locally are childless. &lt;G&gt; I have good <br/>
relationships with the local unschoolers, but I&#39;ve had to dump the hard <br/>
core schoolers and school-at-homers (doh!) because of how they treat <br/>
their kids. But it&#39;s my choice, and I&#39;m OK with that. My virtual <br/>
friends (on this list and others)---well, I just try to see them <br/>
whenever I can. I plan a yearly party to do just that! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  OH! and I also wanted to say that you could talk with your daughters <br/>
about what&#39;s happening. Cameron was really hurt that people would think <br/>
Ben and I were so crazy---he wanted us to be &quot;normal&quot; again. And his <br/>
friends told him that he would be stupid. Patience. Patience. Patience! <br/>
I told Cameron that they would see eventually. I was right. Even the <br/>
in-laws are coming around! &lt;LOL&gt;<br/>

  School&#39;s goal is to prepare them to be anything they want. But the <br/>
process is so dullifying and kids haven&#39;t explored the possibilities of <br/>
what they could be that many set their sites as low as possible. They <br/>
go to college to get a job to buy stuff. ~Joyce Fetteroll<br/>
