multiple times, you can&#39;t teach someone until they&#39;re ready to learn.<br/>
*********<br/>
When I came here to this list, I came for a reason. To learn about unschooling.<br/>
If someone isn&#39;t ready, then they are more than welcome to do whatever they want and come back here when they ARE ready.<br/>
Why would someone be here if they don&#39;t want to learn about unschooling?<br/>
We&#39;re not forcing ANYONE to sit here and read and write.<br/>
We are recommending reading lists so that we don&#39;t have to answer the same questions over and over when the info is already out there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1930613272">Hello everyone, <br/>
after reading here (and a few books) for a while, and<br/>
being excited about becoming a &#39;radical unschooler&#39;<br/>
here are my questions I would love to have<br/>
discussed/answered. I am still new to writing on<br/>
lists, so please bear with me. And I certainly do not<br/>
mind any and all opinions, I loved hearing and seeing<br/>
Ren and Kelly at the conference and have a so much<br/>
respect and gratitude for all of you who are running<br/>
this.<br/>
So, in the hopes of deepening my understanding, here<br/>
it goes.<br/>
I have 4 children I am hoping to unschool, almost 2,<br/>
almost 5, 15 (stepson who just left highschool) and 18<br/>
(who went through the system and has a LOT of healing<br/>
to do).<br/>
I guess my biggest issue is that I am alone in all<br/>
this. We have no babysitters, family, friends etc. who<br/>
come and help out, either with just household things<br/>
or watching one or the other for a bit ...<br/>
Mh dh is working a lot and quite busy, he says he is<br/>
fine with me doing whatever that is I am doing as the<br/>
kids seem to be quite happy and understanding.<br/>
Unfortunately we have a few run-ins about his and my<br/>
parenting style. He thinks when he asks ds to do<br/>
something he should just do it without always asking<br/>
&#39;why&#39;, once I heard him say &#39;if you don&#39;t stop this I<br/>
will send you to your room&#39;, or &#39;do you want to loos<br/>
that toy&#39; etc. - all things I abhore and would never<br/>
do to someone. So, trying to avoid confronting him in<br/>
front of the children, I try to bring it up later -<br/>
which is not always possible of course since ds (4)<br/>
will usually then turn to me crying and I can not and<br/>
will not enforce these things. DH will then go on to<br/>
say that once again I make it difficult for him to do<br/>
anything with ds, that how can I not sometimes let him<br/>
&#39;parent&#39; too -<br/>
his way that is. That it should not matter so much as<br/>
he is usually not around that much anyways. And that I<br/>
should try to enforce when he says something. <br/>
I have tried to talk to him about how to say things<br/>
differently, that my children are very understanding<br/>
and that I NEVER have an issue of &#39;disobedience&#39;<br/>
simply because I treat them as equals who might just<br/>
need a bit more help with some things. The older boys,<br/>
in dealing with the younger ones, often mimick what<br/>
dad does because he was the one who raised them &#39;his<br/>
way&#39;. (And boy did they fight sometimes). Although I<br/>
recently say the 15 yo cringe when he would not let<br/>
the youngest go to me when he wanted to and told him<br/>
to not let him cry like that. My dh says he does not<br/>
hear him cry and that he should just stay with him too<br/>
sometimes. He does, he loves his daddy, but sometime<br/>
he just wants me, or does not want to be held etc. and<br/>
that should be fine too. <br/>
There are times though  things are difficult. Like<br/>
when we are at a restaurant or store and he starts<br/>
tearing the place apart or running around through the<br/>
tables. I understand a store is not the greatest place<br/>
for young ones and my biggest challenge to the<br/>
unschooling ways. I have no choice but to take them<br/>
with me, and the older one is no problem, he would<br/>
read in the cart or help me out looking for stuff<br/>
etc., but the youngest just wants to run and DO stuff.<br/>
I have tried letting him help me put stuff in the<br/>
cart, but he then wants to keep doing it (like<br/>
throwing ALL those lemons in there - or do they bounce<br/>
when I throw them?) . He has a very exploratory<br/>
spirit, and I feel bad having to say &#39;no&#39; (in other<br/>
words, as he HATES that word and I try not to ever use<br/>
it) - but the same idea - you can not pull all these<br/>
from the shelves, don&#39;t take the eggs out because they<br/>
might break, don&#39;t keep running away please etc. etc.<br/>
 Usually I feel totally exhausted and not so great<br/>
after the usual 2 hour ordeal. I do try to give them<br/>
snacks as well, which helps some, or let them carry<br/>
some things that can not break around with them for a<br/>
while, but I still don&#39;t know how to do this more<br/>
graceously.<br/>
Then there is bedtime - I have tried to let them<br/>
decide for themselves - now the usual bedtime for my<br/>
almost 5 is midnight - then he sleeps until 10 or<br/>
10:30 am. The youngest usually falls asleep a bit<br/>
earlier - then wakes up earlier - if I want<br/>
uninterrupted time with the older kids or dh I have to<br/>
wake up again which often I am too tired to do. When I<br/>
do I just have to tackle that huge mountain of clothes<br/>
to be washed or folded, yet another dishwasher, clean<br/>
the playroom, living room etc. etc. It is just me who<br/>
does everything, and even though I try to get a lot<br/>
done in the day I am just NEVER done and noone helps<br/>
out. I don&#39;t mind doing it, it is just that sometimes<br/>
I feel bad that I don&#39;t have as much one-on-one time<br/>
with my kids as so much time is spend cleaning up. I<br/>
always now when someone asks to do someting say to<br/>
myself &#39;why not&#39; and then do it -<br/>
Why not dump a mountain of flour on the kitchen floor<br/>
and play with it (see how you can make eggs with a<br/>
spoon?), Take out the paints, builds pirate ships out<br/>
of all the furniture etc.,<br/>
I do love all this and don&#39;t mind the trouble, it is<br/>
just that sometimes then I don&#39;t have time for other<br/>
things or even really play with them, other then some<br/>
minutes, sometimes just an hour a day of uninterrupted<br/>
playing with castles and knights. Often not even that.<br/>
My dh does not really see me alone anymore, I am too<br/>
exhausted at night, I get sick a bit more often, and<br/>
now when I am supposed to clean or spend time with dh<br/>
all I could get up for is this email list. <br/>
My children are generally very happy, content and<br/>
inquisitive - and I am very gratefull for our life. We<br/>
have wonderful times together and letting them choose<br/>
what they want to do or eat etc. has been wonderful. <br/>
I guess I am just sometimes wondering if I can do it<br/>
all by myself - and what it will do to them if the<br/>
whole surrounding world of family (close and extended)<br/>
is not so supportive of our ways, and critizises<br/>
(what, he is almost 5  and still can not read or count<br/>
beyond 10? ) <br/>
As to the reading, I have let go almost of wanting to<br/>
try to teach him something, but would you still offer<br/>
things like : Would you like me to show you how to<br/>
draw an E? Or just wait till he asks me to? Or is it<br/>
more like: Would you like to read this book or play<br/>
that new game? Or are alphabet things too learning<br/>
oriented and not just fun like books and games - if he<br/>
would answer &#39;no&#39; of course I always respect that. I<br/>
recently showed him one of those workbooks at a store<br/>
where you trace the letters etc. and asked him if he<br/>
wanted one of those. He took a quick look and said no,<br/>
but he loves doing the maze books and can complete<br/>
very complex mazes, even ones for ages 8-12.<br/>
I suppose I am answering my own question. I just<br/>
wonder if there are things that are fun that I could<br/>
just kind of offer him and that might teach him to<br/>
read on his own? Is just reading to him a LOT (which<br/>
he loves) enough? Will he make the connection himself<br/>
between big and small letters, or are there things you<br/>
have to tell them - not make him do - just tell or<br/>
offer. Like I do tell my ds (almost 2) that he can pee<br/>
in the toilet ( or a bowl, anywhere but on the carpet)<br/>
too if he does not like the diaper. This is some issue<br/>
as well. He hates wearing it and I try to respect<br/>
that. I have to be very alert, he is not pretty much<br/>
dry at night, he wakes me up when he needs to pee, I<br/>
put a diaper on him quickly or hold it under him and<br/>
when he is done take it away.  But then there are all<br/>
the times he does not tell me and the pee and poop go<br/>
on the carpet etc. Do I force him to wear a diaper?<br/>
How does radical unschooling work with very young<br/>
children? He usually does understand that he still<br/>
needs one when we go out. <br/>
I guess the biggest issue I have trouble with is<br/>
criticism and the lack of support. I have yet to find<br/>
other unschoolers in the area that I can connect with.<br/>
<br/>
I sometimes do find kids for my ds (almost 5) to play<br/>
with, but the things he witnesses in behavior and<br/>
parenting are often less than positive. He was just in<br/>
heaven at the unschooling conference. That&#39;s why I<br/>
sacrificed my wish to hear the speaches for his need<br/>
to just play with all these really cool, sweet kids.<br/>
He still remembers being at a friends house, and how<br/>
he just stood there watching them fight, then one of<br/>
them being locked out in the garage ( in the middle of<br/>
winter) screaming and banging on the door. We were<br/>
both horrified. Also when we go places, most kids are<br/>
there with their babysitters who spend most time on<br/>
cellphones, and when he asked if maybe he could invite<br/>
one of those kids over to play, that never happens,<br/>
because it is totally impossible to approach the<br/>
parents or babysitter or I can just see it won&#39;t work<br/>
too well. <br/>
Any and all advice appreciated. And I do promise I try<br/>
to keep things shorter next time. I usually don&#39;t even<br/>
have the time.<br/>
<br/>
Alright, one more thing. In unschooling the older<br/>
ones, I don&#39;t ask them to help around the house with<br/>
cleaning, but I can barely keep up, let alone go any<br/>
further than just dealing with the worst of messes.<br/>
Sometimes I feel like I am drowning in them - I do<br/>
understand they have their own teenage things and<br/>
issues to deal with, but sometimes it&#39;s just hard. <br/>
So, now onwards to the dishwasher and laundry...<br/>
With much appreciation,<br/>
Mara and the boys<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1355459628">Wow Mara, you have your hands full.  No wonder you&#39;re a bit <br/>
stressed.  The main thing I see in your post is that you are trying <br/>
to do everything all by yourself.  It&#39;s like you&#39;re being a slave to <br/>
your children for the sake of unschooling.  Why do you not ask the <br/>
kids, ALL of them, to help you with housework?  It&#39;s a necessary <br/>
part of life.  It doesn&#39;t have to become a strict thing like in some <br/>
families with mandatory chores, rewards, etc.  I have never bought <br/>
into that even before I heard of radical unschooling.  My kids <br/>
always have the option of saying no when I ask them to help me, but <br/>
they very rarely do.  Sometimes, they are busy with something else <br/>
but will get to the request later.  I can&#39;t think of any housework <br/>
that has a do-right-now priority.  <br/>
<br/>
My children are 8, 9 and 14.  Even when they were toddlers, they <br/>
loved helping out.  I&#39;ve always praised their efforts even when I <br/>
knew I could have done a better job.  But a half-dusted living room <br/>
is better than an all dusty living room.  Over time, their skills <br/>
have been improving.  They all know how to do laundry, load/unload <br/>
the dishwasher, wash down countertops and table, dust, vacuum.  The <br/>
only thing they don&#39;t really do is the bathroom.  My dd8 does enjoy <br/>
cleaning out the sink but I&#39;m the only one who isn&#39;t bothered by <br/>
cleaning the toilets.  *laugh* But housework can actually be fun <br/>
when you turn on some music and everyone works together.  We always <br/>
have a blast!<br/>
<br/>
I think you should have a discussion with your children about family <br/>
support.  Don&#39;t worry so much about outside-the-family, focus first <br/>
on your children.  They may be a greater support than you know!  <br/>
<br/>
As for your 5 year old not reading, I don&#39;t think you should push <br/>
him.  You can work on the alphabet without making it a boring <br/>
lesson.  I used to sing to my children all the time when they were <br/>
little.  They sang the ABC song when they were toddlers.  They <br/>
really loved pointing out letters they knew.  I remember my son <br/>
being 3 years old and being so excited to see a stop sign.  He&#39;d <br/>
yell S-T-O-P means stop!!  My daughter Allison recognized the letter <br/>
A early on because it was the first letter in her name.  She&#39;d point <br/>
out all the &#39;A&#39;s&#39; she could whether it was at home in a book or <br/>
while driving around seeing signs.  If he likes you reading aloud to <br/>
him, do that.  We have always read aloud and we love it!  I find it <br/>
more enjoyable than reading alone because we talk about the book <br/>
together.  Those are actually good reading skills.  Comprehension is <br/>
understanding what is happening in the story.  Vocabulary words are <br/>
defined as you come across something he doesn&#39;t know.  My kids <br/>
usually stop me and say &#39;Mom, what does X mean?&#39;  I define it <br/>
quickly, and then keep on reading.  I don&#39;t stop to turn it into a <br/>
lesson, or write it down which makes it look like schoolwork.  They <br/>
are hearing the word used in context and that&#39;s a super great way of <br/>
learning new words.  Also, we love to predict what might happen next <br/>
in a story.  We just play &#39;what if&#39;.  What if the main character <br/>
does this?  Or Oh no, what do you think is going to happen if he <br/>
does that?  We just feels it makes reading aloud more fun to do <br/>
those types of things.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I&#39;ve written too much.  I&#39;m rambling.  :)<br/>
<br/>

 &#39;parent&#39; too -<br/>
 his way that is.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I wouldn&#39;t avoid confronting your husband in front of the children.<br/>
<br/>
  I think *he* needs to know you&#39;re serious. So do the kids: they need <br/>
to know you *will* stand up for them in front of their father.<br/>
<br/>
  If my husband were to say, &quot;Go to your room,&quot; I would say, &quot;No, of <br/>
course you don&#39;t have to go to your room. A person&#39;s room should be his <br/>
sanctuary, not a prison. Come here to me, and we&#39;ll talk about it.&quot; &quot;Do <br/>
you want to lose that toy&quot; would be met with: &quot;Of course he doesn&#39;t <br/>
want to lose that toy. It&#39;s his favorite. and he&#39;s having so much fun <br/>
with it right now. Why would you want to punish him like that? &quot; In <br/>
front of my husband and the kids. They need an ally, not a &quot;united <br/>
front&quot; that the conventional parenting books suggest.<br/>
<br/>
  I think that, if he insists on being a difficult parent, then it would <br/>
help him to realize *how* his children will view him later. Tell him!<br/>
<br/>
  Did he have this kind of relationship with his father? How&#39;s that <br/>
relationship now? How does he feel about his relationship with his dad <br/>
when he was little? Is that what he wants with his kids?<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;d tell him that, if he wants to parent &quot;his&quot; way, then he needs to <br/>
be able to deal with the consequences---angry wife, fearful children, <br/>
unhappy family.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 That it should not matter so much as<br/>
 he is usually not around that much anyways. And that I<br/>
 should try to enforce when he says something.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I think flat our refusing to do this should be priority #1!<br/>
<br/>
  And if he&#39;s not around that much, remind him that he&#39;s like an ogre <br/>
intruding on their peacefful lives. It would be better, expecially if <br/>
he&#39;s not there often, to take a more &quot;backseat&quot; role instead of plowing <br/>
ahead and expescting everyone to jump when he says so.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I have tried to talk to him about how to say things<br/>
 differently, that my children are very understanding<br/>
 and that I NEVER have an issue of &#39;disobedience&#39;<br/>
 simply because I treat them as equals who might just<br/>
 need a bit more help with some things. The older boys,<br/>

 he just wants me, or does not want to be held etc. and<br/>
 that should be fine too.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=--<br/>
<br/>
  Children who are made to do what adults *make* them do are ripe <br/>
targets for pedophiles and other predators.<br/>
<br/>
  If he doesn&#39;t hear the baby cry, then maybe he&#39;s not the best person <br/>
for the baby to be with. He&#39;ll need to be more in tune with the baby <br/>
before I&#39;d leave them alone.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 There are times though things are difficult. Like<br/>
 when we are at a restaurant or store and he starts<br/>
 tearing the place apart or running around through the<br/>
 tables.<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  If he&#39;s not able to go to a restaurant, maybe he&#39;s not ready to go to <br/>
a restaurant.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=--=-<br/>
<br/>
 He has a very exploratory<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
 He&#39;s getting older every day. This won&#39;t last forever.<br/>
<br/>
  Maybe others have ideas for this kind of personality. Both of mine <br/>
were pretty easy to deal with in stores and restaurants.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Usually I feel totally exhausted and not so great<br/>
 after the usual 2 hour ordeal. I do try to give them<br/>
 snacks as well, which helps some, or let them carry<br/>
 some things that can not break around with them for a<br/>
 while, but I still don&#39;t know how to do this more<br/>
 graceously.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
  Lord! Two hours is LONG! Maybe shorter trips for just a few things <br/>
would be a good idea. Maybe even everyday, just for a few minutes each <br/>
day.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Then there is bedtime - I have tried to let them<br/>
 decide for themselves - now the usual bedtime for my<br/>
 almost 5 is midnight - then he sleeps until 10 or<br/>
 10:30 am. The youngest usually falls asleep a bit<br/>
 earlier - then wakes up earlier - if I want<br/>
 uninterrupted time with the older kids or dh I have to<br/>
 wake up again which often I am too tired to do.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Have you tried making the house a quiet, serene, dark, sleepy place <br/>
earlier in the evening? Turn down the lights, put on soft music, give a <br/>
warm bath, massage little feet or heads? Make the atmosphere conducive <br/>
to sleep. Maybe they&#39;d go down a little earlier.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 When I<br/>
 do I just have to tackle that huge mountain of clothes<br/>
 to be washed or folded, yet another dishwasher, clean<br/>

 My dh does not really see me alone anymore, I am too<br/>

 now when I am supposed to clean or spend time with dh<br/>
 all I could get up for is this email list.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 Yeah--these e-lists can do that to you!<br/>

like now.<br/>

 have wonderful times together and letting them choose<br/>
 what they want to do or eat etc. has been wonderful.<br/>
 I guess I am just sometimes wondering if I can do it<br/>
 all by myself -<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m hoping you can work with your husband and your step-son to <br/>
understand what you&#39;re trying to do/accomplish. Maybe then they could <br/>
be of help.<br/>
<br/>
 -==-=-<br/>
<br/>
 and what it will do to them if the<br/>
 whole surrounding world of family (close and extended)<br/>
 is not so supportive of our ways, and critizises<br/>
 (what, he is almost 5 and still can not read or count<br/>
 beyond 10? )<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 THAT should be the least of your worries.<br/>
<br/>
 If they&#39;re not helping now, why should they concern you at all?<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 As to the reading, I have let go almost of wanting to<br/>
 try to teach him something, but would you still offer<br/>
 things like : Would you like me to show you how to<br/>
 draw an E? Or just wait till he asks me to? Or is it<br/>
 more like: Would you like to read this book or play<br/>
 that new game? Or are alphabet things too learning<br/>
 oriented and not just fun like books and games - if he<br/>
 would answer &#39;no&#39; of course I always respect that. I<br/>
 recently showed him one of those workbooks at a store<br/>
 where you trace the letters etc. and asked him if he<br/>
 wanted one of those. He took a quick look and said no,<br/>
 but he loves doing the maze books and can complete<br/>
 very complex mazes, even ones for ages 8-12.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  If he sees you writing, he&#39;ll probably make his way over and play with <br/>
the pens and paper. He&#39;ll figure out the E when he&#39;s ready---he&#39;ll ask <br/>
you if he&#39;s having problems.<br/>
<br/>
  Alphabet things come up a LOT with littluns---TV, books, games, <br/>
refrigerator magnets, songs---they&#39;re everywhere! And they *can* be <br/>
fun! They *are* fun!<br/>
<br/>
  Just get the books if you can afford them. He may not be interested <br/>
now. But if they&#39;re sitting on a shelf he can reach, the chance is that <br/>
he&#39;ll get to them one day.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I suppose I am answering my own question. I just<br/>
 wonder if there are things that are fun that I could<br/>
 just kind of offer him and that might teach him to<br/>
 read on his own?<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=--<br/>
<br/>
 It&#39;s the journey, not the destination. He&#39;ll read. I promise! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Is just reading to him a LOT (which<br/>
 he loves) enough?<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Yep!<br/>
<br/>
  And answering questions and listening to books-on-CD and reading <br/>
vowel-less words on the refrigerator and telling him how to spell <br/>
things and....<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Will he make the connection himself<br/>
 between big and small letters, or are there things you<br/>
 have to tell them - not make him do - just tell or<br/>
 offer.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 What do *you* think? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Like I do tell my ds (almost 2) that he can pee<br/>
 in the toilet ( or a bowl, anywhere but on the carpet)<br/>
 too if he does not like the diaper. This is some issue<br/>
 as well. He hates wearing it and I try to respect<br/>
 that. I have to be very alert, he is not pretty much<br/>
 dry at night, he wakes me up when he needs to pee, I<br/>
 put a diaper on him quickly or hold it under him and<br/>
 when he is done take it away. But then there are all<br/>
 the times he does not tell me and the pee and poop go<br/>
 on the carpet etc. Do I force him to wear a diaper?<br/>
 How does radical unschooling work with very young<br/>
 children? He usually does understand that he still<br/>
 needs one when we go out.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I&#39;m not the best with littluns---Others can address that.<br/>
<br/>
 BUT 1) summer&#39;s here<br/>
 and 2) he&#39;s getting older every day! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 -==-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I guess the biggest issue I have trouble with is<br/>
 criticism and the lack of support.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Just with your husband? or neighbors? or extended family?<br/>
<br/>
 --=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I have yet to find<br/>
 other unschoolers in the area that I can connect with.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=--=<br/>
<br/>
 Where are you?<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I sometimes do find kids for my ds (almost 5) to play<br/>
 with, but the things he witnesses in behavior and<br/>
 parenting are often less than positive. He was just in<br/>
 heaven at the unschooling conference. That&#39;s why I<br/>
 sacrificed my wish to hear the speaches for his need<br/>
 to just play with all these really cool, sweet kids.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Ain&#39;t that grand? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=--=<br/>
<br/>
 He still remembers being at a friends house, and how<br/>
 he just stood there watching them fight, then one of<br/>
 them being locked out in the garage ( in the middle of<br/>
 winter) screaming and banging on the door. We were<br/>
 both horrified. Also when we go places, most kids are<br/>
 there with their babysitters who spend most time on<br/>
 cellphones, and when he asked if maybe he could invite<br/>
 one of those kids over to play, that never happens,<br/>
 because it is totally impossible to approach the<br/>
 parents or babysitter or I can just see it won&#39;t work<br/>
 too well.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  As painful as it can be, sometimes seeing how bad things somewhere <br/>
else are can make you appreciate what you have! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 -==-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Alright, one more thing. In unschooling the older<br/>
 ones, I don&#39;t ask them to help around the house with<br/>
 cleaning, but I can barely keep up, let alone go any<br/>
 further than just dealing with the worst of messes.<br/>
 Sometimes I feel like I am drowning in them - I do<br/>
 understand they have their own teenage things and<br/>
 issues to deal with, but sometimes it&#39;s just hard.<br/>
 So, now onwards to the dishwasher and laundry...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Why don&#39;t you ask? If you are comfortable with a negative answer, why <br/>
not ask?<br/>
<br/>
  They may not be ready to help out, but they probably will eventually. <br/>
Try it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1994351176">Thank you Kelly and Beth for your great responses. It<br/>
really helps to have that support, and you are so<br/>
right. Now I will not waver at all and firmly stand my<br/>
ground in front of them. We had a long talk the other<br/>
day (after quite a few run-ins) and I believe he is<br/>
realizing how serious I am about this. The anger he<br/>
has been having about my not giving in to &#39;his way&#39; is<br/>
slowly turning to a way to understand. Sometimes now I<br/>
will see him trying to use my way, and even if it is<br/>
somewhat &#39;fake&#39;, it might become more natural after a<br/>
while. So instead of saying &#39;when you don&#39;t stop<br/>
throwing the blocks at me xyz will happen, he said,<br/>
why don&#39;t you try to build a castle with those...&#39; and<br/>
got the answer &#39; oh, yea, why not.&quot;. Yes, often it is<br/>
that easy. He is slowly getting that instead of<br/>
repeatedly saying &#39;no&#39; to a young child he is not<br/>
going to hear it any better the fifth time, that a<br/>
simple redirection or explanation works wonders.<br/>
He did have a lousy relationship with his own father<br/>
and is sure that his father is in some way responsible<br/>
for his cancer - and dealing with that has brought up<br/>
a lot of issues. He wants to be a good dad and has<br/>
practically given his life to raising the two older<br/>
ones for 10 years by himself - the only way he knew<br/>
how. He did the best he could - all my ways are so new<br/>
to him but since he loves and respects me he IS trying<br/>
to understand. <br/>
There was a big conflict within myself in not trying<br/>
to stress him due to his condition, it would have been<br/>
easier for him would I let the children cry sometimes<br/>
for his sake - but I realize that would in the long<br/>
run not be healthy for anyone. <br/>
The diaper issue with the 22-month old is resolving<br/>
itself. He is now dry at night and most during the day<br/>
if I am fast enough to stick a bucket in front of him<br/>
- when he needs to poop he just pats his bum and says<br/>
popo (german for bum), very funny. Also in true<br/>
unschooling fashion, I solved the pee-on-carpet issue<br/>
by just taking the carpets out of the room -<br/>
I love it how the children surprise me every day in<br/>
the things they want to learn - I have learned so much<br/>
with them already it is a great and wonderful journey.<br/>
As to the older kids it is more complicated. I<br/>
actually do ask them to help sometimes - they<br/>
sometimes say &#39;yes&#39;, but often forget, or they feel<br/>
like they &#39;have to&#39;. Today the 15 year old actually<br/>
let the 4 y.o. play with him and his friends for quite<br/>
some time. <br/>
My issue with the older ones is that dh still thinks<br/>
that they are only &#39;his&#39; concern, that at least with<br/>
them he can treat them the way he has always done<br/>
without me interfering. I slowly try to get in there<br/>
more but I also realize I am not their &#39;real&#39; mom (<br/>
whom they see maybe once a year and has no idea that<br/>
one of her sons even left school...). I often feel<br/>
like I am - but still I feel like I can not do the<br/>
things or say the stuff I would were they not my<br/>
stepchildren. Don&#39;t know how to deal with that issue<br/>
better - it was my doing that dss left school but now<br/>
that he is out dh is still using &#39;school&#39; methods of<br/>
punishment/reward etc. and I don&#39;t get consulted, just<br/>
hear about it &#39;later&#39;.  How is this unschooling then<br/>
supposed to work? <br/>
<br/>
As to being German and cleanliness - people have often<br/>
said that I am the least german German they have ever<br/>
met. When I grew up our house was always stuffed full<br/>
of books and art etc. and was cozy but did not always<br/>
look so clean. How shocked was I when I say our<br/>
neighors houses where you could always eat off the<br/>
floor, the couches were covered in plastic when noone<br/>
sat on them and the few books on the shelves were<br/>
fake. So, I do like order, but just enought to enjoy<br/>
life.<br/>
<br/>
A short note on spelling - I never learned to spell in<br/>
English, I simply learned when I came to this country<br/>
in my twenties and just had to do it, and reading lots<br/>
of books in English. Now I am often  better at it than<br/>
dh. Motivation Is everything.<br/>
<br/>
thanks again,<br/>

&gt;  And I certainly do not<br/>
&gt;  mind any and all opinions, I loved hearing and<br/>
&gt; seeing<br/>
&gt;  Ren and Kelly at the conference and have a so much<br/>
&gt;  respect and gratitude for all of you who are<br/>
&gt; running<br/>
&gt;  this.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  -=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  And I enjoyed meeting and talking with you!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  -=--=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  Unfortunately we have a few run-ins about his and<br/>
&gt; my<br/>
&gt;  parenting style. He thinks when he asks ds to do<br/>
&gt;  something he should just do it without always<br/>
&gt; asking<br/>
&gt;  &#39;why&#39;, once I heard him say &#39;if you don&#39;t stop this<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt;  will send you to your room&#39;, or &#39;do you want to<br/>
&gt; loos<br/>
&gt;  that toy&#39; etc. - all things I abhore and would<br/>
&gt; never<br/>
&gt;  do to someone. So, trying to avoid confronting him<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt;  front of the children, I try to bring it up later -<br/>
&gt;  which is not always possible of course since ds (4)<br/>
&gt;  will usually then turn to me crying and I can not<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt;  will not enforce these things. DH will then go on<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt;  say that once again I make it difficult for him to<br/>
&gt; do<br/>
&gt;  anything with ds, that how can I not sometimes let<br/>
&gt; him<br/>
&gt;  &#39;parent&#39; too -<br/>
&gt;  his way that is.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  I wouldn&#39;t avoid confronting your husband in front<br/>
&gt; of the children.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I think *he* needs to know you&#39;re serious. So do<br/>
&gt; the kids: they need <br/>
&gt; to know you *will* stand up for them in front of<br/>
&gt; their father.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   If my husband were to say, &quot;Go to your room,&quot; I<br/>
&gt; would say, &quot;No, of <br/>
&gt; course you don&#39;t have to go to your room. A person&#39;s<br/>
&gt; room should be his <br/>
&gt; sanctuary, not a prison. Come here to me, and we&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; talk about it.&quot; &quot;Do <br/>
&gt; you want to lose that toy&quot; would be met with: &quot;Of<br/>
&gt; course he doesn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; want to lose that toy. It&#39;s his favorite. and he&#39;s<br/>
&gt; having so much fun <br/>
&gt; with it right now. Why would you want to punish him<br/>
&gt; like that? &quot; In <br/>
&gt; front of my husband and the kids. They need an ally,<br/>
&gt; not a &quot;united <br/>
&gt; front&quot; that the conventional parenting books<br/>
&gt; suggest.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I think that, if he insists on being a difficult<br/>
&gt; parent, then it would <br/>
&gt; help him to realize *how* his children will view him<br/>
&gt; later. Tell him!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Did he have this kind of relationship with his<br/>
&gt; father? How&#39;s that <br/>
&gt; relationship now? How does he feel about his<br/>
&gt; relationship with his dad <br/>
&gt; when he was little? Is that what he wants with his<br/>
&gt; kids?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I&#39;d tell him that, if he wants to parent &quot;his&quot;<br/>
&gt; way, then he needs to <br/>
&gt; be able to deal with the consequences---angry wife,<br/>
&gt; fearful children, <br/>
&gt; unhappy family.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  -=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  That it should not matter so much as<br/>
&gt;  he is usually not around that much anyways. And<br/>
&gt; that I<br/>
&gt;  should try to enforce when he says something.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  -=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  I think flat our refusing to do this should be<br/>
&gt; priority #1!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   And if he&#39;s not around that much, remind him that<br/>
&gt; he&#39;s like an ogre <br/>
&gt; intruding on their peacefful lives. It would be<br/>
&gt; better, expecially if <br/>
&gt; he&#39;s not there often, to take a more &quot;backseat&quot; role<br/>
&gt; instead of plowing <br/>
&gt; ahead and expescting everyone to jump when he says<br/>
&gt; so.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  -=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  I have tried to talk to him about how to say things<br/>
&gt;  differently, that my children are very<br/>
&gt; understanding<br/>
&gt;  and that I NEVER have an issue of &#39;disobedience&#39;<br/>
&gt;  simply because I treat them as equals who might<br/>
&gt; just<br/>
&gt;  need a bit more help with some things. The older<br/>
&gt; boys,<br/>
&gt;  in dealing with the younger ones, often mimick what<br/>
&gt;  dad does because he was the one who raised them<br/>
&gt; &#39;his<br/>
&gt;  way&#39;. (And boy did they fight sometimes). Although<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt;  recently say the 15 yo cringe when he would not let<br/>
&gt;  the youngest go to me when he wanted to and told<br/>
&gt; him<br/>
&gt;  to not let him cry like that. My dh says he does<br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt;  hear him cry and that he should just stay with him<br/>
&gt; too<br/>
&gt;  sometimes. He does, he loves his daddy, but<br/>
&gt; sometime<br/>
&gt;  he just wants me, or does not want to be held etc.<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt;  that should be fine too.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  -=-=--<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Children who are made to do what adults *make*<br/>
&gt; them do are ripe <br/>
&gt; targets for pedophiles and other predators.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   If he doesn&#39;t hear the baby cry, then maybe he&#39;s<br/>
&gt; not the best person <br/>
&gt; for the baby to be with. He&#39;ll need to be more in<br/>
&gt; tune with the baby <br/>
&gt; before I&#39;d leave them alone.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  -=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  There are times though things are difficult. Like<br/>
&gt;  when we are at a restaurant or store and he starts<br/>
&gt;  tearing the place apart or running around through<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt;  tables.<br/>
&gt;  -=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   If he&#39;s not able to go to a restaurant, maybe he&#39;s<br/>
&gt; not ready to go to <br/>
&gt; a restaurant.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  -=-=--=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  He has a very exploratory<br/>
&gt;  spirit, and I feel bad having to say &#39;no&#39; (in other<br/>
&gt;  words, as he HATES that word and I try not to ever<br/>
&gt; use<br/>
&gt;  it) - but the same idea - you can not pull all<br/>
&gt; these<br/>
&gt;  from the shelves, don&#39;t take the eggs out because<br/>
&gt; they<br/>
&gt;  might break, don&#39;t keep running away please etc.<br/>
&gt; etc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  -=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  He&#39;s getting older every day. This won&#39;t last<br/>
&gt; forever.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Maybe others have ideas for this kind of<br/>
&gt; personality. Both of mine <br/>
&gt; were pretty easy to deal with in stores and<br/>
&gt; restaurants.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  -=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  Usually I feel totally exhausted and not so great<br/>
&gt;  after the usual 2 hour ordeal. I do try to give<br/>
&gt; them<br/>
&gt;  snacks as well, which helps some, or let them carry<br/>
&gt;  some things that can not break around with them for<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt;  while, but I still don&#39;t know how to do this more<br/>
&gt;  graceously.<br/>
