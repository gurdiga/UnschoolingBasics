<div id="ygrps-yiv-1373396146">Okay...our family is just now getting interested in gaming.  Much <br/>
because we hear so much of it in unschooling/geek circles.  But our <br/>
prediciment is we know very little about it all but would like more <br/>
info.<br/>
<br/>
We have just started Warhammer 40K (still painting pieces and <br/>
learning at this point) with the Battle for Macragge set <br/>
(Ultramarines and Tyrinids) and the Sisters of Battle.  The local <br/>
game store has been able to help alot.  However, our problem is that <br/>
many of the games that go on in the store are not &quot;family <br/>
freindly&quot;.  Some of the players are rather aggressive or do not want <br/>
children to play.  We know a few other kids that would like to play <br/>
but either their parents oppose or they are not availble (only on <br/>
Dad&#39;s weekends kind of thing).  Has anyone had luck with organizing <br/>
a family/kid-friendly Warhammer 40K group?  I&#39;ve thought about <br/>
posting a notice on the game store bulletin board looking/asking for <br/>
family/kid leagues...but do you think anyone would be interested?<br/>
<br/>
We picked up a D&D book but decided, unless we have some experienced <br/>
people to play with, we&#39;d be totally lost.  Same situation as <br/>
before...we won&#39;t have a family/kid-friendly group.  Any ideas how <br/>
to find one?  (Getting experienced D&D players/DM is the key.)<br/>
<br/>
As for WoW, our perticular game store doesn&#39;t do WoW.  And we know <br/>
absolutely nothing about it. I can go online...but it would be nice <br/>
to actually have a person explain the gist.  I have to actually talk <br/>
about it and see it happening for it to make sense to me...I had to <br/>
do that with Warhammer 40K...I had to watch a live demo at the <br/>
store. DH knows a little about RPG type games and has filled in some <br/>
of the gaps for me...but he doesn&#39;t know anything about WoW either.  <br/>
How do we find more info/people if the game store doesn&#39;t have <br/>
it/them?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Sure! Why not try at least?<br/>
Have you worked within your local home/unschool support group. We&#39;ve<br/>
found other D&D players that way, and other gamers too.<br/>
Lucky for us, my boys were well-versed in D&D before we moved here<br/>
(our last group was built from homeschool support group kids) and they<br/>
could show Sierra and I how to play. We found another family that<br/>
wanted to learn (the Dad had played old style) and had a group going<br/>
for a while.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the other games, the conference might be a great time to<br/>
pick the minds of other gamers! They always have a big gaming area set<br/>
up and at least one main play time where they&#39;ve got it all up on big<br/>
screens....a giant LAN party for everyone. Great time to learn the<br/>
basics probably.<br/>
<br/>
You could buy the game guide, which walks you through most everything.<br/>
But the best way to start is just do it. You&#39;ll figure stuff out by<br/>
being on there and asking questions. There are areas where lots of<br/>
level 1&#39;s have just started and you won&#39;t feel so out of place. I know<br/>
some other unschoolers that Sierra plays with if you wanted to create<br/>
a WoW character on that server so you could learn from my 9y.o. and a<br/>
few others.:) She&#39;s a newbie at it, but just playing and asking<br/>
questions in order to learn it all.  She&#39;s lucky enough to have an<br/>
experienced level 60 in the house too....but most of what she&#39;s doing<br/>
is just being online playing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-542877785"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Have you worked within your local home/unschool support group?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am almost afraid to ask.  They think it&#39;s a sin to even shop at <br/>
non-Christian book store...much less a game/comic store.  <br/>
<br/>
We are in Cleveland, TN and the only HS group around is radically <br/>
Christian...for lack of a better term and no other unschoolers (At <br/>
least not yet...I&#39;m working on some of the traditionalists).  In <br/>
fact, the HS group&#39;s message board just got finished discussing <br/>
whether TV/electronic entertainment is &quot;evil&quot; or not and how much, <br/>
what, and how often to &quot;allow&quot; it into your home.  Could you imagine <br/>
if I brought up gaming?  Mind you, we consider ourselves Christian <br/>
but we look like out right pagans compared to these people.  <br/>
Needless to say, we don&#39;t rely on or socialize much with the HS <br/>
group.<br/>
<br/>
I know some Christian gammers (they actually own the game store in <br/>
town) but they are a far exception to the rule here.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the support I get is from the unschooling message boards <br/>
(UB, TNUS, & CL)...Thank you!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; As far as the other games, the conference might be a great time to<br/>
&gt; pick the minds of other gamers!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I hope to be able to attend this year with it being in NC.  We&#39;ll <br/>
have to see what the budget looks like by then.  I noticed all the <br/>
gamming that went on at the website.  It was a factor that lead to <br/>
our family wanting to start gamming. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But the best way to start is just do it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know, that&#39;s why I&#39;m frustrated...just can&#39;t find a place to fit <br/>
in.  So, WoW is an Online game?  That just confuses me even more...I <br/>
thought it was more like the others with a &quot;board & pieces&quot;.  <br/>
Aaagghh, help!<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m optomistic...something will work out.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Ren.<br/>
