<div id="ygrps-yiv-607746083">Ellen, we are in northern Vt, and sent in our paper work in Feb. It only took a week to hear <br/>
back. I didn&#39;t list a single book.  We did list possible museum visits, but everything else was <br/>
very general.  My advice, don&#39;t worry so much about specifics, we used the unit study <br/>
aproach(they show an example in the packet).  Good luck.  Also if you use general terms, and <br/>
the phrase &quot;may include, but will not be limited to..&quot; then you cover a lot.   Melanie in Vt</div>
