<div id="ygrps-yiv-794521421">Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Wow! What can I say, just when I thought I&#39;ve understood enough to <br/>
make that all important decision to homeschool our 6 year old son, <br/>
and then, when researching the all important &quot;do I or do I not limit <br/>
the playstation?&quot;, I&#39;ve stumbled into the &quot;world of unschooling&quot;, a <br/>
totally different segment of homeschooling, only deeper! I like <br/>
what&#39;ve I&#39;ve read so far about unschooling, it makes sense to me as <br/>
I was one a little child too but it is too scary/radical for me as <br/>
mother, to accept??!! Strange how it all makes perfect sense to me <br/>
on one side but yet hard to let go on the other. But as always, for <br/>
me and my kid, common sense rules and wins all the time!   <br/>
<br/>
As for the playstation? Well, I&#39;ve read enough to understand that it <br/>
can be educational too, and if we don&#39;t put time limit on it, it <br/>
won&#39;t be that &#39;unforbidden fruit&#39; and will lose it&#39;s novelty <br/>
eventually, as did the tv and the pc! <br/>
<br/>
Glad to have found your world and will be staying for a while.<br/>
<br/>
With best regards,<br/>
