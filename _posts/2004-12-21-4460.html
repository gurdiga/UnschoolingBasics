<div id="ygrps-yiv-598672869">&quot;Once the shriek is out she takes a deep breath and<br/>
seems to feel much better. Just being able to complain about <br/>
changing or<br/>
leaving and say &quot;no&quot; a few times allows her to get to agreement <br/>
after a<br/>
little while. Maybe that other boy&#39;s screaming is part of his <br/>
process???&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I would like to remind everyone, that the original poster was <br/>
advocating video game limits for her child AND stating that he would <br/>
throw a tantrum when she had to make him stop playing to attend a <br/>
playdate. I don&#39;t think that is on the same level as difficulty in <br/>
transitioning, though I&#39;m quite sure that is part of the child&#39;s <br/>
challenge.<br/>
<br/>
This IS a list for challenging ourselves as parents, in relation to <br/>
unschooling philosophies. Gentle and for newbies yes, advocating <br/>
arbitrary limits, no. So while there will be a wide variety of <br/>
opinions and beliefs here, and all are going to have their own way <br/>
of doing things, the PURPOSE of this list is to hopefully show that <br/>
there are other options to traditional parenting practices like <br/>
limiting video games.<br/>
Everyone is where they are. No one here is trying to make anyone be <br/>
or do anything they aren&#39;t comfortable with. But if you post about <br/>
things in opposition to the unschooling philosophy of trust, it WILL <br/>
get a strong response and a lot of intense discussion.<br/>
<br/>
I for one have thoroughly enjoyed the recent discussions...I think <br/>
it&#39;s been conducted respectfully and with a lot of good questions <br/>
and examples. It came to my attention today that some folks might be <br/>
seeing this as a petty arguement, but hey, this list is for <br/>
discussion!!<br/>
Carry on......:)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess I didn&#39;t get the same message from the original poster.  I never <br/>
got the impression that she *made* him stop playing to attend a <br/>
playdate.  I thought she was giving an example of her son&#39;s difficulty <br/>
in disengaging by describing his reaction when she *asked* him to stop <br/>
playing because it was time for a playdate that he had requested.  In <br/>
fact, the situation she described occurred before she was setting any <br/>
limits (which she is now doing for health reasons, not for <br/>
playdate-breaking reasons, as far as I can tell).  The original <br/>
conversation is quoted below:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Did I read in another post that you tried no limits on screens in<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; the past?  If so, for how long? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>2 years<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; And during that time did he<br/>
 &gt; honestly engage with a screen non-stop from the time he woke up<br/>
 &gt; until the time he went to sleep again? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, any attempt at any other activity was met with tantrums. Even<br/>
attempts to disengage him to go to an activity that he had asked me<br/>
to set up for him (a playdate, a homeschool group activity)&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Then in a later post she clarified further:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt; If you were forcing him, kicking and screaming, to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; attend play dates when he would rather play video<br/>
 &gt; games, that doesn&#39;t sound like &quot;unlimited&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, let&#39;s please not put words in my mouth. I didn&#39;t force him<br/>
kicking and screaming to do anything. You&#39;ll notice I said that he<br/>
was screaming when I &quot;asked him to disengage&quot;. Asking someone<br/>
politely is hardly the same as dragging them kicking and screaming. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree completely.  I just wanted to state that as a relative newbie <br/>
myself I did not get the impression that the original poster was <br/>
*making* her child stop playing video games to attend a play date.  I <br/>
*did* read with interest her reasons for limiting screen time and <br/>
everyone&#39;s responses to her concerns about her child&#39;s health.   Even <br/>
more valuable to me was the spin-off discussion about putting one <br/>
child&#39;s needs/feelings above another&#39;s.  I recently put my child&#39;s <br/>
feelings above those of my 93 year old grandmother who &quot;could die any <br/>
day&quot; as my mother put it as she tried to guilt me about my choice ( I <br/>
responded that so could my son--she didn&#39;t appreciate that very much.).  <br/>
These discussions are so important to me in helping me parent my children. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks everyone!<br/>

<br/>
Maria posted about her 3 1/2 yo watching many many straight hours of <br/>
videos and was simply wondering what we all thought about it - she <br/>
didn&#39;t advocate anything, just questioned and she was NOT the person <br/>
who said her child had tantrums and meltdowns over having to stop. Here <br/>
was her post - her only post:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;My son aged 3 years 2 months has been watching movies on video<br/>
endlessly. Today he watched about 5 movies, from approximately 11<br/>
in the morning to 7 in the evening, stopping only for a short period<br/>
to get in the van to go drop off his sisters somewhere. I have<br/>
allowed him to watch all he wants, but to be honest I hate the fact<br/>
that he watches so much. So I am wondering, is this normal? Should<br/>
I be setting limits? Is this a phase he is going through? Should I<br/>
just let him watch all he wants until he eventually gets it out of<br/>
his system? Will he ever get it out of his system?<br/>
<br/>
Any advice would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
TIA<br/>
Maria &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
In the ensuing discussion, Robin Clevenger posted about the limits her <br/>
family DOES set and explained why (myopia concerns) and then posted <br/>
that one of her children has severe problems with disengaging. She <br/>
said:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Or, just possibly, it&#39;s a harder time self-regulating. I don&#39;t mean<br/>
enjoying an activity &quot;more&quot;, I mean being unable to break away from a<br/>
screen to do things you actually want to do, like, say eat dinner,<br/>
even when you&#39;re hungry. Or go out with your friends when they&#39;re<br/>
standing there asking you to. I think it&#39;s great that your kids don&#39;t<br/>
have this issue. One of mine does. We didn&#39;t limit his screen time<br/>
for 2 years. We had constant battles when we asked him to disengage<br/>
for anything, even things he asked us to set up like a playdate, he&#39;d<br/>
have a screaming fit when it was time to go. Personally, I&#39;m not<br/>
willing for our lives to be like that. &gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Thank you for clarifying Pam. It was the &quot;I&#39;m not willing for my <br/>
family to be like that&quot; and the ensuing discussion on how time <br/>
limits work that paint a bigger picture for me. <br/>
<br/>
If nothing else comes of this discussion, I&#39;m hoping newer folks can <br/>
at least see there are much better options to time limits. Time <br/>
limits are arbitrary, solving individual problems and family <br/>
challenges can be done in a much more creative manner.<br/>
<br/>
So maybe there was no child being stopped from playing a video game <br/>
when a tantrum was thrown...but when someone says they aren&#39;t <br/>
willing for that and says they will continue with time limits, one <br/>
wonders.<br/>
