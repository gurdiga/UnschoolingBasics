<div id="ygrps-yiv-146555219">I just want to thank everything for the input in regard to their <br/>
feelings, opinions and ideas on cleaning up or not.  I will try on <br/>
some of what was suggested and see if it fits.  Many of the <br/>
decisions I have made in my life have come from a place of what if <br/>
this was the last day I had on this planet so I can put those <br/>
glasses on fairly easily.  I was diagnosed with a terminal cancer in <br/>
1991 and the wake up call helped.  I tried to take a look at the <br/>
why&#39;s of my behavior.  I realize part of the attachment to order is <br/>
a safety issue.  We have four floors and three flights of stairs.  A <br/>
couple of weeks ago after I was out the night before at a conference <br/>
and the room was not in it&#39;s normal order because his dad didn&#39;t put <br/>
everything back Alexander tripped over a cushion and got a goose egg <br/>
on his forehead when it hit the rocker.  He has also fallen down the <br/>
stairs, tripped over something and chipped his tooth on a metal <br/>
railing and done a few other headers.  I know kids get injuries.  It <br/>
is never an easy thing for me to deal with.  I think part of that <br/>
comes from early childhood when I was responsible for my younger <br/>
brother and he was gashing himself regularly with blood squirts and <br/>
stitches.  Accidents do freak me out.  Alexander has had regular <br/>
chiropractic treatment because of it.  I think part of the <br/>
attachment I have to not slipping and falling on stuff and keeping <br/>
the floor cleared is that not doing so literally caused injuries.  I <br/>
also have a 20 year history of being a construction worker and just <br/>
being conscious of the danger of an unsafe enviornment.  These are <br/>
just my own personal issues I will need to work through.  I am <br/>
keeping an open mind and I want to look at things from a different <br/>
perspective.  I will probably come by this whole thing slowly.  I do <br/>
not currently have any unschooling support regarding friends so I am <br/>
dependent upon boards like this.  I read that there is an OC group <br/>
and I would be interested in attending that park day.  Thanks again <br/>
to all who shared.  <br/>

<br/>
Ah, those personal issues we all have eh?:)<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking, as I read your post, that maybe part of the shift, <br/>
might be in how you arrange your home. Maybe there are some things <br/>
that could be changed, in order to make it more kid friendly as far <br/>
as safety?<br/>
I recently realized that I still had a lot of &quot;shoulds&quot; in my head <br/>
in regards to my home. Who says a living room has to contain <br/>
furniture? Who says I can&#39;t have an acrobat bar hanging from the <br/>
beam in the middle of the room in a very small house? :)<br/>
I&#39;ve limited myself in terms of how a house should be arranged, and <br/>
we&#39;re slowly changing that.<br/>
My friends think we have a pretty darn kid-friendly house, but I was <br/>
still thinking too much of visitors and not realizing the <br/>
possibilities.<br/>
So we&#39;re going with big pillows and beanbags in the living <br/>
room...maybe one loveseat for visitors that truly can&#39;t sit on the <br/>
floor pillows.  I want to have a mini-trampoline stashed somewhere <br/>
and a bar hanging for the kids to swing on.<br/>
I am planning to paint the wall by our teensy dining area, so that <br/>
it has a chalk board surface as part of a mural, and framed kid art <br/>
all over.<br/>
Rather than get upset about my nice furniture getting ruined, we&#39;ll <br/>
just get rid of it! Instead of fussing at the kids about painting on <br/>
the walls, we&#39;ll make art walls! <br/>
Sometimes the little shifts in thinking can make a big difference.<br/>
Perhaps you have an extra bedroom, or dining area that could contain <br/>
most of his art/toy stuff, so it doesn&#39;t end up on stairs as often?<br/>
I don&#39;t know your situation of course, but I bet there are some <br/>
possible changes that could be made, in order to avoid a lot of the <br/>
mess stress.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1776716170">When we got our new, not expensive eating area table, we moved the old one into the garage, that has not had a car in it for years.  I also moved the old dresser from my sons room out there, and put down those large alphabet foam squares under it all.  Now my son has his own craft area.  The dresser is full of everything he wants to work with, with the paint on the top, as I still like to help with those.  This way, he can take out and leave out whatever he wants to work on, for as long as he wants to work on it.  The foam cleans very easy, and is nice to walk on.  It is a little hot there right now, with the summer, but a fan makes it nice.  I am planning hanging fishing line or something like that from the ceiling, so we can hang up all his paintings to dry, and have a place to display them all.  We are constantly in the garage, as it is the only way to the back yard, where the pool and trampoline is.  This way he gets to have his area to play and create, and we still have a place<br/>
 for dad and I to sit and eat dinner.  Son does not like to sit at the table with us, so he is in with the TV  for most meals!!  <br/>
