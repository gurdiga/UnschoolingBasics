<div id="ygrps-yiv-222971493">My 16 y/o has a best friend (also 16) whose parents are going through a bitter custody battle. The Dad wants to obtain sole custody so he can send his daughter off to boarding school or be absolved of further child support. (long details made short)<br/>
<br/>
This friend spends a great deal of time over at our house. The Dad has decided that my daughter is The Bad Influence (unschooling, too much freedom, smokes pot, etc. ) and is using details of our home life in his custody battle. (once again, long story made short)<br/>
<br/>
Supposedly, according to my daughter and this best friend, this Dad and/or his lawyer have &quot;hacked&quot; into her myspace and have been gathering &quot;evidence&quot; to support his case. (her myspace profile is set to private).  <br/>
<br/>
Can anyone &quot;hack&quot; into someone&#39;s myspace pages? Can an adult spy on a minor in this manner  possibly with the assistance of a lawyer and not have to inform the parents? Should I be overly concerned abou this?  Is CPS gonna show up because of a pic or text talking about pot smoking or something?  I am livid over this intrusion and don&#39;t know what, if anything, I should &quot;do.&quot; Any ideas appreciated. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1499640986">I would assume that pretty much anything can be hacked.  I don&#39;t think it would be legal.  Maybe myspace has a privacy or security notice you could read on their site.  Maybe you could talk to a lawyer about it?  I would think any information obtained illegally would not be able to be used in the case.<br/>
 <br/>
However, to be on the safe side, I would suggest to the daughter that for the time being, she should be careful what she posts, even if her profile is set to private.<br/>

My stepdaughter&#39;s mom has gone onto her daughter&#39;s myspace and facebook  <br/>
accounts on several occasions, hasn&#39;t like what she&#39;s seen and canceled the  <br/>
accounts.  Same with her phone records...found out she made a call after  midnight <br/>
on her cell phone when she was staying with us and took away her  phone when <br/>
she returned home from her visit with us.<br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s a whole different post about trust and privacy but apparently it  <br/>
isn&#39;t very difficult to sneak a peek into your child&#39;s private electronic  life.  <br/>
Not cool but parents do it and then use it against their children or  in this <br/>
situation use it for ammunition in a custody case.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There are many programs that you can download onto your computer (for<br/>
a fee).  That &quot;spy&quot; on your children.  These programs are hidden from<br/>
all the files, and only accessable by hitting a key combination, and<br/>
then inputting a password (that presumable only the adult would know).<br/>
<br/>
This would allow her father to know exact key strokes, passwords,<br/>
text/im messages.  The computer actually records everything that is<br/>
typed into it, as well as every page that is visited.  <br/>
<br/>
So, if your daughter, or best friend is using a computer in her<br/>
father&#39;s home to go online, he could possibly have this program on his<br/>
computer, and have knowledge of what is going on....the other<br/>
possibility would be if her father created a false account, and was<br/>
able to have your daughter or her friend &quot;add&quot; him (or her) as a<br/>
friend.  Sometimes these kids have friends on their list that they<br/>
don&#39;t really know.  <br/>
<br/>
Good luck to you.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-6018860">Thank you to all who have replied to this.  I have decided that I am going to try and not let this bother me. I have a good relationship with my daughter and I know what she is up to and where she is at all times, unlike this girl and her father. In fact, I know  where his kid is pretty much all the  time which is something I cannot say for him. I find it reprehensible that this Dad is using my daughter as some kind of central theme in his custody battle. He is blaming her for decisions his own daughter ultimately makes on her own.  Also, he invaded the privacy of a minor for crying out loud. He has a terrible relationship with her, and won&#39;t accept responsibility for the fact that its his fault.  I just hate being dragged into someone else&#39;s quagmire, and its having an affect on my daughter, which angers me to no end. I can&#39;t wait until she heads off to NBTSC and hangs out with other unschoolers. It will be a good break for her. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-57158377">In short, yes, someone can &quot;hack&quot; into a MySpace account, to obtain <br/>
evidence against someone in a custody battle.  One of my best friends <br/>
has lost custody of her two children to her mother because <br/>
of &quot;evidenc&quot; obtained from her Private MySpace account.  <br/>
<br/>
I have noticed myself on MySpace, anything I type is picked up by the <br/>
Cookies, to create targeted advertising.  FOr example, I wrote about <br/>
a hir cut yesterday, so today, there are all these hair product ads.  <br/>
<br/>
But more seriously, the DHS ties with the MySpace parent company <br/>
assure that there is no such thing as annoynimity, everything said or <br/>
posted on MySpace can and will be used against you in a court of <br/>
law.  <br/>

social networking pages. I&#39;m pretty sure that at least one of them <br/>
warned that what you post has been used against people. They said that <br/>
employers have even looked at myspece pages and fired/failed to hire <br/>
people based on what they saw!<br/>

Setting to private helps but as other posters pointed out--once you <br/>
accept someone as a &quot;friend&quot; they have access. And, of course, anyone in <br/>
the household has access if you just leave the computer on while your <br/>
signed in or if they have the parental monitoring stuff.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-69457992">**However, to be on the safe side, I would suggest to the daughter that for <br/>
the time being, she should be careful what she posts, even if her profile is <br/>
set to private.**<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s something that should be pointed out to anyone using the social <br/>
networking sites, and for more than just &quot;the time being&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
People have lost jobs because of what they posted on their &quot;private&quot; pages, <br/>
teens in high schools have been suspended or expelled because of pictures <br/>
showing them engaged in illegal acts. Prospective employers look at them, colleges, <br/>
police departments. And kids seem to forget that even when an account is set <br/>
to private, that provocative picture of themselves and their little quote line <br/>
are out there for all the world to leer at.<br/>

It&#39;s probably a good idea, in general, to never say anything you don&#39;t <br/>
mind hearing in a recording, never doing anything you don&#39;t mind seeing <br/>
on film, and never writing anything you don&#39;t mind seeing in print one <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1633965416">My sister and her husband use a spy program on their computer that <br/>
allows them to see every type of activity that anyone does on their <br/>
computer. It stores all passwords and notifys them on their cell phones <br/>
whenever a key word have been typed or recieved to their computer. They <br/>
even add all of the key words to a special list. <br/>
I had no idea that they had this until I visited and my sister told me <br/>
that when I go home I may want to change all of my passwords!<br/>

Me too.<br/>
I know which children don&#39;t mind being talked about and which prefer<br/>
it be kept very simple or vague or don&#39;t want their pictures up. <br/>
So you&#39;ll see a lot more about Sierra and Jalen!:)<br/>
<br/>
Trevor has been fine with most of it lately too, but he lives with<br/>
other people now so I don&#39;t have many stories.<br/>
<br/>
Before the NE Unschooling conference I had gotten permission from both<br/>
Moira and Trevor to talk about certain topics (like sex) but it still<br/>
embarrassed her when I brought it up in one of the round tables. I<br/>
apologized later and asked her if if I shouldn&#39;t have said that and<br/>
she said &quot;No, it was fine and I was ok with that but it still felt<br/>
weird when there was a room full of people&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She says it&#39;s still ok to talk about though.;) I don&#39;t want to<br/>
embarrass anyone! I really enjoyed the openness of all the teens there<br/>
and connecting with them over sensitive topics. Very cool.<br/>

misconstrued and used against you..  It can intentionally or untentionally<br/>
be taken completely out of context or separated from any context at all.<br/>
For instance if it occurs as part of a conversation, anything posted can<br/>
seem to be written as though it occurred alone.  I know I have a hard time<br/>
remembering where something I&#39;ve written comes from unless the rest of the<br/>
context is there for reference.<br/>

about 14 years. I have never had ANY problem with feeling like my  <br/>
privacy has been invaded at all.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re just using a first name and kids&#39; first names, I don&#39;t see  <br/>
how that can be a problem ever. That doesn&#39;t identify them anymore  <br/>
than using an initial (I find that very irritating because I can&#39;t  <br/>
keep the initial in my head - have to constantly read back to remember  <br/>
which kid was X and which was Y.)<br/>
<br/>
With my kids, their decision at the time has been for me to do it. If  <br/>
they change their minds later, then I&#39;d stop doing it, but I&#39;m not  <br/>
going to stop just in case they might possibly not like it, later. It  <br/>
just isn&#39;t likely, anyway, that they&#39;d change their minds. The  <br/>
opposite has happened with mine - they are used to being a bit in the  <br/>
public eye and they have become more and more eager to speak for  <br/>
themselves about their own unschooling experience. All three have  <br/>
spoken in front off audiences - been on teen panels or given  <br/>
conference talks. And two of the three have written college essays or  <br/>
done college speeches related to their unschooling experience.<br/>
