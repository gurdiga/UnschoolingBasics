I&#39;m sure this is OT, but I was hoping that someone here could help me....My four year old has had a bad case of the stomach flu the last few days and I&#39;ve been concerned about dehydration.  She weaned herself at 19 months, but as I&#39;m still nursing my 2.7 yo, I thought that maybe my breast milk might be soothing and allay the dehydration issues.  The problem is, she doesn&#39;t remember how to suck.....can kids relearn?  She&#39;s tried a few times, but with no success.  <br/>
Thanks for any input!<br/>

<br/>
I haven&#39;t dealt with the relatch question, but I think they can relearn.  Do<br/>
you have La Leche League there?  I think there may even be a hotline you can<br/>
call.  Here is the link to the MA LLL :<br/>

chapters, but I don&#39;t know where exactly you are.<br/>
<br/>
I do know that the mother&#39;s milk is really easy to digest and is probably<br/>
the best thing for her.  It&#39;s perfect that it will be a bit more fatty<br/>
because your body is nursing the 2.7yo.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck to you!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2137202257">Hi Beth,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not an expert on breastfeeding but when my son was born he did<br/>
have such a &quot;weak suck&quot; that my lactation consultant thought she was<br/>
going to have to send us to an occupational therapist who specialized<br/>
in mouth issues and we were going to need a special bottle just to get<br/>
any kind of nutrition, breastmilk or otherwise, in to him.<br/>
<br/>
It took my son 10 weeks to figure out how to breastfeed and the main<br/>
problem was that he was not using his tongue to pull the breast in to<br/>
the back of his mouth.  I am guessing your 4 year old has forgotten<br/>
how to use her tongue to latch on properly since this is not something<br/>
she would do with a cup or even a straw.  You should be able to find a<br/>
diagram online (maybe La Leche League) that shows how a baby&#39;s tongue<br/>
is  used to properly position the breast and increase the power of the<br/>
suck.  I am sure if your daughter saw this she could start to relearn<br/>
the process since the muscle memory would be there.<br/>
<br/>
If you have access to a breast pump (available for rent at most birth<br/>
centers and hospitals), you might want to try to pump some breastmilk<br/>
for her.  If your 2 year old frequently nurses, this might work.  I<br/>
found with my son that when he was 18 months old and on a trip with<br/>
his dad for 5 days I was barely able to maintain my milk supply via<br/>
pumping.  When he was 2.5 and I had to go on a trip without him for 9<br/>
days, I found I wasn&#39;t able to pump any milk at all and I ended up<br/>
having to wean him then.  Not sure about other people&#39;s experiences<br/>
with pumping during extended breastfeeding, but that was mine.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you can figure out a way to make this work.  I am sure your<br/>
daughter and her tummy would benefit greatly from the breastmilk.<br/>
<br/>
All the best,<br/>
Kerry<br/>
P.S. a quick Google turned up this diagram on breastfeeding -<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.breastfeeding.com/helpme/helpme_images_anatomy.html.">http://www.breastfeeding.com/helpme/helpme_images_anatomy.html.</a>  It is<br/>
a bit hard to read but indicates the position of the tongue.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1691730727">My 3 1/2 year old relearned how to latch on after about 3 months of  <br/>
forgetting how to latch on which led, in the end, to no  <br/>
breastfeeding.  I travelled for one week and when I returned she  <br/>
seems to have learned to suck again in the way to get the milk out.   <br/>
But it was much easier for her to relatch on one side and not on the  <br/>
other.<br/>
My son had stopped breastfeeding for 18 months when his sister was  <br/>
born and could not relearn how to latch on.  So in the end he would  <br/>
wait till the milk was spraying and I would put it in a cup for him.   <br/>
After a couple of times he lost interest but he never relearned  <br/>
latching on.<br/>
Your daughter has been off for quite a while so pumping may be the  <br/>
only scenario.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-440113732">My daughter self-weaned at 18 months. She was 3 when her sister was born.<br/>
About 6 months later, she started wanting to breastfeed again. It took her<br/>
about 3 or 4 weeks to &quot;remember&quot; how to latch, but she did. She&#39;s now almost<br/>
5 and will still occasionally co-nurse with her sister. So I&#39;d say, your<br/>
daughter is open to trying, go for it. Otherwise, I think the &quot;breastmilk in<br/>
a cup&quot; idea might work.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1820409526">You might try the charm hold.  It worked for ds when he was 16 weeks old and<br/>
he had never had a decent latch-on until I did the charm hold.  This is how<br/>
it goes:<br/>
<br/>
Sit in an armless chair or on a sofa.<br/>
Gravity is going to help this process.<br/>
Have the child lay down belly first across your legs.<br/>
Let the child suck your left pinky finger and when you feel the child latch<br/>
on the finger, turn the child over and see if she can latch onto the breast.<br/>

Thanks so much to everyone who responded with ideas....I never even thought of the cup idea b/c I&#39;ve never been a good pumper. But, I tried it and she turned a major corner last night.  We have our cheery, happy, healthy girl back.  Shortly after breastmilk, she asked for pancakes!<br/>

I offered some in a cup to my then 3 yr old when he had a stomach <br/>

spit it out and said &quot;that sucks!&quot; It was funny but I was also I <br/>
