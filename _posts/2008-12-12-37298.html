<div id="ygrps-yiv-1433667022">Hey everyone! I am usually a lurker on this group but thought I would <br/>
ask the advice of ya&#39;ll on the topic of drafting programs. <br/>
<br/>
I started unschooling this year, after I came to the very true <br/>
realization that textbook teaching was not at all suitable to my <br/>
kiddos&#39; way of thinking and learning and we&#39;ve had such a blast ever <br/>
since! <br/>
<br/>
My daughter has found that designing automobiles and working on model <br/>
cars is what she loves. I thought that introducing her to computers, <br/>
i.e. learning about how to use graphics and drafting programs, would <br/>
enhance her current interest in designing cars and paint graphics. <br/>
Now the quandary: some of these programs can get VERY pricey!!! <br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if any of the ladies out there in internet land had a <br/>
child...or even a spouse, who currently pursued an interest in this <br/>
field who could suggest a program that would be suitable for a <br/>
beginner that is not too pricey? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance! <br/>
Christine</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1904035809">Hmm I work for a software developer in the CAD/CAM field - and prior to<br/>
this I worked for a CAD software company. You might check out any local<br/>
colleges or vocational schools - check their bookstore (or wherever the<br/>
students get their materials) and see if you can find a copy of whatever<br/>
CAD software they use in their classes - student versions are usually<br/>
much cheaper than the pro versions. The demo version of our software is<br/>
pretty cheap because it can&#39;t save files (it&#39;s just a demo after all)<br/>
but there is a basic design type package. However, she might also want<br/>
to have solids modeling capabilities since much of the industry is<br/>
heading in that direction. Also, I know that places like Home Depot have<br/>
some pretty basic type architectural software packages on sale - you can<br/>
push them to do other stuff but their strong suit is doors and windows<br/>
and roof styles and things like that.<br/>
<br/>
If you want, feel free to email me directly and I&#39;ll try to be more<br/>
specific (I&#39;m trying to be really careful to not mention specific<br/>
brand/product names right off) and see what I can do to help out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1609889183">TY for the suggestion! This program looks amazing! I downloaded the google earth application a while ago and my son just loves it. He has learned SO MUCH about Geography using this program. Did you know this has an auto link to wikipedia in it as well as a flight simulator? I am just amazed at the &quot;did you know&quot; discussions that come out of a session using this program. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1587947593">www.anim8or.com go to download page and read directions. The website<br/>
also has tutorials and a user forum.<br/>
 Free 3D drawing software - this is what DH and DS use to make new<br/>
&#39;stuff&#39; to use on the Roblox website. It&#39;s pretty cool - DH suggests<br/>
looking through the tutorials because some things are not totally<br/>
intuitive<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2095269743">I&#39;ve used Google&#39;s free Sketchup to design furniture. I&#39;m a<br/>
woodworker, and it was my first foray off pencil and graph paper.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s free, so no loss. AND it works on a MAC!!<br/>
