<div id="ygrps-yiv-2011964132">Hello,<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve started a local unschooling list in hopes of connecting & helping  <br/>
others learn about unschooling here in Louisiana.  I myself am relatively  new to <br/>
it since my daughter is only 5 1/2 & I only &#39;discovered&#39; unschooling  about 2 <br/>
years ago.  <br/>
 <br/>
Although I&#39;m mostly a lurker on these lists due to time constraints, I now  <br/>
come to you for advice and suggestions from one of our listmembers.  She  gave <br/>
me permission to forward her post to you to seek your  advice.  Since I have <br/>
so little experience the only thing I could think of  was to suggest she find <br/>
an electronically minded person as a mentor...and that  we seek advice HERE :)<br/>
 <br/>
The first part of the email is a response/advice she got from our list  :(  <br/>
As you can see, she needs some suggestions from real  unschoolers!!!  <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks in advance.   ~ Denise<br/>

the big problem with math is that it is cumulative and<br/>
must be  learned from start to finish. you can try to<br/>
teach just the formula but the  problem is there are so<br/>
many parts to the formula that need to be known  first<br/>
and each formula changes with each problem (measuring<br/>
the volume  of a cone and a prism requires 2 similar<br/>
but very different formulas)also  those formulas might<br/>
require knowledge of square roots or powers.  Unless<br/>
you know or are a math whiz it is hard to teach<br/>
&quot;unschooled&quot;  Forget those public school gifted<br/>
classes, all they did was give the kids  more work to<br/>
do (keep them busy so they did not disrupt the class).<br/>
Math  is one of the main reasons i am home schooling.<br/>
Having a future  Neurosurgeon who is doing 7th grade<br/>
math instead of 5th and a future  Architec who is doing<br/>
9th grade Algebra instead of 7th (they both  probably<br/>
would be farther but i can&#39;t keep up!)I know<br/>
unschoolers hate  to hear it but i am going to suggest<br/>
a curriculum that lets the child learn  from basic on<br/>
up. It is called Saxon Math (their home school<br/>
version)  You can go on line print up the test, give it<br/>
to Derek and find out where  you need to start him off.<br/>
It has a lot of repetition, that is so the kids  learn<br/>
&quot;sight answers&quot; (knowing multiplication, adding,<br/>
subtracting,  common fractions and square roots just<br/>
off the top of their head) This is  important for the<br/>
child that is going to go into advance math with  some<br/>
formulas that take 3 hours to do and 20 pages of paper<br/>
(it sure  makes the problem a lot easier if they don&#39;t<br/>
have to stress on the little  stuff {and saves a lot of<br/>
time}). Again this is for the unschooler who will  need<br/>
to know math for their future goals. I am not<br/>
suggesting this for  unschoolers who feel this does not<br/>
fit into their methods. I hope i was of  some help.<br/>

&gt;  inquire with other unschoolers about a snag our<br/>
&gt; family has hit  recently.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Our son, Derek, unschools.  Sometimes he just  floats<br/>
&gt; around indulging in whatever hits his fancy, other<br/>
&gt;  times he has come to us with a list of topics he<br/>
&gt; wants to learn about,  and asks for help. So far, the<br/>
&gt; things he wants to learn about have  been fun to come<br/>
&gt; up with resources and ideas for him to explore.   For<br/>
&gt; example, he wants to learn about other countries. <br/>
&gt; He&#39;s  asked me to give him something to do so he can<br/>
&gt; learn, so I put  together a &quot;backpacking through<br/>
&gt; Europe&quot; idea for him.  There&#39;s  not much to it, other<br/>
&gt; than he started off with Italy and is now in  France.<br/>
&gt;  We jot down a slew of questions about the  country<br/>
&gt; and he goes and researches the answers.  Some of  the<br/>
&gt; questions lead him to learning about scientists and<br/>
&gt;  inventors from those countries that invented or<br/>
&gt; discovered things that  wow and amaze Derek, so he<br/>
&gt; starts researching those topics as  well.  When Derek<br/>
&gt; feels he&#39;s learned a lot about the country, he  then<br/>
&gt; puts together a menu of authentic cuisine from that<br/>
&gt;  country, sends out a fancy invitation to us and his<br/>
&gt; grandmother and  her friend to attend the dinner, and<br/>
&gt; he then cooks a four course  dinner for us of<br/>
&gt; authentic cuisine and teaches us about the country.  <br/>
&gt; He&#39;s an amazing chef so we are spoiled with a<br/>
&gt; wonderful  dinner.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, it&#39;s not really a formal study or program  or<br/>
&gt; anything, it&#39;s just something fun that he enjoys and<br/>
&gt; has  asked us to continue doing. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Derek&#39;s big passion is studying  electronics.  He&#39;s<br/>
&gt; off on his own with this, using electronic  kits,<br/>
&gt; books, and collecting bits and pieces from broken<br/>
&gt;  appliances and gadgets and turning them into<br/>
&gt; electronic toys.   Last night he demonstrated an<br/>
&gt; airboat he built from bits and  parts.  His mission<br/>
&gt; is to be the first person to build an  electric<br/>
&gt; plane.  He brought in a diagram he drew of his<br/>
&gt;  design, and it&#39;s very impressive (this coming from<br/>
&gt; me, who knows  nothing about electronics).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, now my dilemna.  Derek  has reached a point in<br/>
&gt; his electronics where he really needs to know  his<br/>
&gt; math. He asks his father, Graham, questions now that<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t  be answered until Derek understands advanced<br/>
&gt; math.  Derek was in  gifted math & science classes<br/>
&gt; when he was in public school, but  after unschooling<br/>
&gt; for 1 1/2 years, he barely remembers what  2+2<br/>
&gt; equals.  This may seem like a knock against<br/>
&gt;  unschooling, but I see it as a knock against the<br/>
&gt; public schools method  of teaching math.  If he truly<br/>
&gt; had learned what they taught (and  he brought home<br/>
&gt; those A++&#39;s all the time), then he would remember  it<br/>
&gt; 1 1/2 years later.  What Derek needs is applied<br/>
&gt;  learning.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; However, the kind of math he needs right now  isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; going to be gained quickly from his cooking, or<br/>
&gt; building  a playhouse, and playing his math computer<br/>
&gt; games.  He&#39;s learning  from those experiences, but<br/>
&gt; for his electronics he&#39;s needing to learn  to some<br/>
&gt; degree of algebraic formulas.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He told  us last night that he wants to learn this<br/>
&gt; math. He&#39;s anxious to get  past the roadblock he&#39;s<br/>
&gt; hit with electronics.  He&#39;s ready to  start building<br/>
&gt; that electric plane.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Does anyone have  ANY advice on how we can help Derek<br/>
&gt; achieve this?  I know nothing  about fancy math<br/>
&gt; formula&#39;s.  Graham has the knowledge, but not  the<br/>
&gt; know how of sitting a child down and teaching them<br/>
&gt;  math.  Plus, Derek has to go back to the basic<br/>
&gt; building blocks  he&#39;s missed out on.  He has a gifted<br/>
&gt; mathematical mind to  understand it all rather<br/>
&gt; quickly, but I haven&#39;t a clue of where to  point<br/>
&gt; Derek to on this one.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would like to  have several ideas of how Derek can<br/>
&gt; learn this advanced math, building  up from the<br/>
&gt; basics, and present them to Derek so he can let us<br/>
&gt;  know what would work best for him.  He&#39;s passionate<br/>
&gt; about wanting  to learn the math he needs for his<br/>
&gt; electronics and I want to provide  him with some<br/>
&gt; outlets.  I need some ideas though.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Does anyone have any advice/ideas they can share?  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>
&gt; Louise<br/>

It is about learning what seems appropriate at the moment.  Learning <br/>
what one needs.  If Derek feels he needs to learn some math, then <br/>
look online for some rudimentary math lessons (they are everywhere <br/>
online) It may be enough to spark his memory about what hehas <br/>
somewhere in his brain.  Then look for some math books.  Look at <br/>
college bookstores for used texts or half.com or even go to thrift <br/>
stores or rummage shops.  Let him look through some books and see <br/>
what sparks his creative juices.<br/>
<br/>
I disagree with the respondant that one must use a curriculum to <br/>
learn math and that using Saxon (gag) is the best way.  (It may be <br/>
the best way for *some* people but I see many flaws in Saxon&#39;s <br/>
theory).  Anyway, my kids have all done higher forms of math with <br/>
only basic skills *and* there is no reason whatsoever that a child <br/>
can&#39;t use a *calculator* to do these basic skills.  Get one of those <br/>
fancy calculators with all the square root buttons and cosign <br/>
buttons.  What are they, scientific calculators?  Guess what?  <br/>
Scientists use those things.  They don&#39;t do all that math in their <br/>
heads, so why do we make kids do it?  (And yes; kids do learn <br/>
mathematics by using a calculator.)  Remember there are two things <br/>
that revolve around numbers.  Mathematics and arithmatic.  <br/>
Mathematics is the study of numbers.  Artithmatic is just doing tons <br/>
of math skill problems.<br/>
