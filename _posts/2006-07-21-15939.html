<div id="ygrps-yiv-1035844277">&quot;I really think that I am missing something in the whole motherhood<br/>
game because in all my years of being a mother I have yet to eat a<br/>
bonbon.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Geez Michelle! Don&#39;t throw a wrench in the cogs...we&#39;ve got this good<br/>
thing going here.  Eat bonbons, tell the kids to go play, yeah, pretty<br/>
good gig. Then we call it unschooling so we don&#39;t look bad.<br/>
<br/>
Disclaimer: *That was total sarcasm for anyone that might have an<br/>
under-developed sense of humor.*<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I prefer truffles and tea, to bonbons and television. I&#39;ve<br/>
been known to hide truffles in my desk, only to have them discovered<br/>
by my chocolate radar-equipped children.  Alas, there are no safe<br/>
secret stashes here.<br/>
