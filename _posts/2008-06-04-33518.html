<div id="ygrps-yiv-2088180405">Oh, I see, I didn&#39;t catch this first post when I responded just now.  My 9 y.o. daughter is just reading, same as yours.  Give it some time with the backwards thing, just modeling your spelling.  If her reading and writing get further along and she&#39;s still doing the backwards writing, maybe look into intervention, just to make sure.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t be concerned.  Getting left-to-right sequencing is <br/>
something that kids just beginning to figure out the code of reading <br/>
and writing don&#39;t give a whole lot of weight to; it&#39;s not really all <br/>
that important to them in the whole scheme of things.  I remember <br/>
reading about this in one of John Holt&#39;s books (I wish I could <br/>
remember which one); he offered the sanest, in my opinion, discussion <br/>
about dyslexia, etc.  As your daughter acquires more literacy skills, <br/>
she will get clear on our culture&#39;s left-to-right sequencing.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s very common for kids to reverse letters. Probably for unschooled  <br/>
kids who do this it persists longer since they aren&#39;t made to  <br/>
practice as they would in school, but longer doesn&#39;t mean forever! No  <br/>
one&#39;s ever mentioned a teen still doing this. :-)<br/>

<br/>
Is this suggestion from knowledge of unschooled kids who were about  <br/>
to leave home and were still reversing letters and words?<br/>
<br/>
Or is this left overs from school where all kids need to be at the  <br/>
same place in development at the same time to make the teacher&#39;s job  <br/>
easier?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-169624109">Oh, Joyce, I LOVE this response!  You are right, logically it <br/>
SHOULDN&#39;T make a difference which way the words or letters face.  My <br/>
kids have Japanese/American cousins who live in Japan and two <br/>
Japanese aunts, and in Japan, books are read opposite from the way we <br/>
read them in America - from back to front in our way of thinking.  <br/>
Also, they write and read from right to left, I believe.<br/>
<br/>
And, my children have cousins who live in Russia (my sister and her <br/>
family are missionaries there) and in Russia, some of their letters <br/>
are &quot;backwards&quot; compared to ours.<br/>
<br/>
So I guess reading is a &quot;cultural&quot; thing.  <br/>
<br/>
When I read your response about a dog being a dog no matter which way <br/>
it faces, I had to smile and lighten up about this &quot;problem&quot; I <br/>
perceived in my daughter.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you again for your response!<br/>

It didn&#39;t seem to bother Leonardo da Vinci. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Duncan has written entire paragraphs backwards. He doesn&#39;t do it much <br/>
any more---sometimes though. He still writes most of his numbers <br/>
backwards. Phone numbers that he takes down for me are still backwards. <br/>
But completely readable.<br/>
<br/>
I practiced writing backwards as a child/teen. With my left hand. I can <br/>
still do it, but it&#39;s not as fluent. Right to left and backwards, <br/>
mirror image. It&#39;s cool.<br/>
<br/>
She won&#39;t do it forever (unless she practices &lt;g&gt;). It will naturally <br/>
turn around as she ages.<br/>
