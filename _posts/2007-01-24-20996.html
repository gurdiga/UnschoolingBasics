<div id="ygrps-yiv-1370976304">Naw, that&#39;s a misinterpretation of the data. The issue is age-specific <br/>
mortality. So, using the book Ache Life History by Kim Hill and Magdalena <br/>
Hurtado a zero year old girl can expect to live to 37.1, while just by <br/>
getting through the first year (when there is the greatest risk of death) <br/>
the 1 year old girl can expect to live to 41.9 years. And by the age of 12 <br/>
the life expectancy of a girl has reach 56.5 years. There is a different <br/>
life expectancy for girls and boys based somewhat on differential care and <br/>
on boys taking greater risks than girls.<br/>
<br/>
In the Wikipedia article linked there is a table listing different life <br/>
expectancies at different points in human history, so, for example, in the <br/>
Bronze Age the life expectancy is listed as 18. Age at menarche, or first <br/>
menstruation, for women without access to the abundance of food that I have <br/>
access to, and presumably you do to, is 14 to 18. Which means, if you take <br/>
the death age to be 18, they would have a baby and have to hand it off to <br/>
some other kid as they died a year or two or three later. Particularly as in <br/>
humans there is a period after reaching sexual maturity when you aren&#39;t <br/>
quite fertile. So, you may be able to menstruate, but many of your periods <br/>
won&#39;t actually have an egg being dropped.<br/>
<br/>
There is a paper cited (which gives a nice blurred life expectancy in the <br/>
table) by Hillard Kaplan (my graduate advisor at UNM) that may or may not <br/>
make things clearer. Actually the life table at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.utexas.edu/depts/classics/documents/Life.html">http://www.utexas.edu/depts/classics/documents/Life.html</a> , which is cited at <br/>
Wikipedia&#39;s life expectancy page, lays it out pretty well. You can see that <br/>
if you look at life expectancy from age 0 you get a very skewed <br/>
understanding of adult age at death.<br/>

P.S. As a personal experience, my great Aunt Pearl married at 12 or 13 (I <br/>
think 12) to an abusive husband whom she later left. But she lived to be <br/>
almost 100. So betting on an early death to marry early didn&#39;t pay off for <br/>
her.<br/>

&gt; If we look<br/>

&gt; marrying in certain cultures.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1187602489">It depends on the population. The Ache, who are a hunter-gatherer population <br/>
from Paraguay, don&#39;t marry that early. They sort of play around at it for a <br/>
little while before settling into a long-term pair bond. I&#39;m talking it over <br/>
with David (dh) at the mo&#39; and he is suggesting that pre-pubertal marriage <br/>
is a way of men monopolozing an entire female&#39;s reproductive career. And I <br/>
can think of at least one population, who have really high infant mortality <br/>
rates to younger mothers, for whom older women who have already had children <br/>
are more sought after than are young women who have never had a baby (the <br/>
Hiwi of Venezuala).<br/>
<br/>
Thinking about my Great-Aunt Pearl, who married at 14, living in rural, <br/>
western Kansas there may also be something about these frontier child-brides <br/>
in an era when more men were moving in than women and so these children were <br/>
seen as fair game for these seemingly affluent, or at least morally upright, <br/>
men. I know that early age at marriage is often associated with frontiers. <br/>
So it is a kind of r-selection reproductive strategy where by having lots of <br/>
kids early who can spread out and utilize lots of the resources available is <br/>
going to lead to greater genetic representation in future generations than <br/>
it would in an environment that was closer to its carrying capacity.<br/>
<br/>
I just found an interesting UK statistics page <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/STATBASE/xsdataset.asp?More=Y&vlnk=5279&All=Y&B2.x=109&B2.y=19)">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/STATBASE/xsdataset.asp?More=Y&vlnk=5279&All=Y&B2.x=109&B2.y=19)</a> <br/>
listing the mean ages of marriage of women from 1846-2001 by previous <br/>
marital status. For all single women in 1846 the mean age at marriage was <br/>
24.71 years old. And here&#39;s a very short list for the U.S. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0005061.html">http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0005061.html</a> which has the median age for <br/>
women in 1890 at 22.0. So, maybe the perception is different from the <br/>
reality? I wanted to find data on the Hutterites, an Anabaptist religious <br/>
sect that have really fascinating patterns of marriage and reproduction, <br/>
with huge birth cohorts, but they are a relatively closed community, and I <br/>
may not be using the right search terms.<br/>
<br/>
There is a lot of stuff out there about age at first marriage. I talked to <br/>
my mom tonight and Aunt Pearl got married because she was pregnant. <br/>
Apparently my grandpa&#39;s family moved to get away from the shame and stigma <br/>
as well. So, there&#39;s one case.<br/>

For other, see my previous post in the &quot;Marrying young&quot; thread. <br/>
<br/>
You could try thinking of the converse: Why *not* marry young in past<br/>
centuries? What would be reasons for waiting? The reasons for waiting<br/>
nowadays just don&#39;t apply as much to back then. The claim that people<br/>
change in their 20s just doesn&#39;t seem as likely to apply back then as<br/>
now, because there wouldn&#39;t be reasons for people to change in their<br/>
20s back then. <br/>

<br/>
Not necessarily. I recommend reading &quot;What is Marriage For?&quot; (cant remember the author.)<br/>
The nuclear family is a relatively recent phenomenon in human history. In the middle ages, when the home was the economic center, people sent their children to other families at very young ages, some as young as 5, to apprentice in other households to learn a trade. <br/>
I cant remember exactly when marriage was institutionalized with legal documents and religious ceremonies, but it was not that long ago. I&#39;&#39;ll have to find that book and quote a few passages if anyone is interested.<br/>

If you could get your young daughter married off you&#39;d have one less mouth <br/>
to feed, and if she was of an age where she might become pregnant, better to <br/>
get her out of your house before you had to feed yet another young&#39;un.<br/>
<br/>
If you married her off  you might benefit as well, gain (some little) social <br/>
status, or if he had property, maybe you could hunt there....<br/>
There&#39;d be another place you might be welcome for dinner if you didn&#39;t have <br/>
anything to eat.<br/>
