<div id="ygrps-yiv-1614281862">I am excited for you, but worried too. It took nine months for my  <br/>
younger kids to deschool....18 months for my oldest. He will very  <br/>
likely want to do nothing, and it will look even scarier than you  <br/>
imagined ;-)  But now everything is amazing! Learning still does not  <br/>
look like school, which is where *I* needed to deschool, but my kids  <br/>
are constantly busy doing Things.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to unschooling, where the journey is mostly about the parents.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2800162">Hi Nikki<br/>
   <br/>
  Though I am no expert, we have been in the process of deschooling for 5 months now and I am beginning to understand how much unschooling is about us and how we have much to gain in trusting our children to take the lead on learning.  It is truly a remarkable process and this week I have seen some changes that have made it all worthwhile.  The best thing I can suggest and I am sure many of the long time unschoolers will have more great ideas to get you started as they have certainly been a shoulder for me to lean on, is to allow the doing nothing, to talk to yourself about your panic and try to understand where it is coming from.  I have been surprised by all my judgements and all my panic about what my children have been choosing to do..especially what I see as doing nothing and what I see as waisted time on the computer and watching movies.  It really is about letting learning come from inside them and valuing what they choose.  I have seen many things differently this<br/>
 week.  Lukas spent hours figuring out Runescape yesterday, downloading, signing up, working through the tutorial etc.  He was so proud of himself for figuring it out all on his own.  Then Kora who loves to watch movies endlessly has spent the last few days asking to make movies with the video camera.  Today she wrote a plot and assigned everyone a role.  It is really about patience....donna<br/>

Don&#39;t expect that his learning will look like school.<br/>
<br/>
Do expect him to spend a lot of time doing &quot;nothing&quot; (or what *looks* <br/>
like nothing) for quite a while.<br/>
<br/>
If you believe it will flop, you&#39;re right.<br/>
<br/>
Change your belief! &lt;G&gt; It&#39;s going to be FUN!<br/>
<br/>
Rent movies. Pop popcorn. Play!<br/>
<br/>
The less you worry, the sooner he&#39;ll deschool.<br/>
