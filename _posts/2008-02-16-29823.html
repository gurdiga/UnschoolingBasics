<div id="ygrps-yiv-1431777767">I&#39;ve been reading some of the posts in this thread and I was reminded of an<br/>
unschooling family with adopted children who had serious trust issues like<br/>
your daughter.  I found her blog and emailed her, asking if I could share<br/>
her blog link with another mom and here is her response:<br/>
<br/>
Please share the links to both my blogs and also to my adoption forum but<br/>
also, tell her to e-mail me. I&#39;d love to help her through this!<br/>

I didn&#39;t tell her anything about you, just that I knew of a mom who might<br/>
find her blog helpful.  Her name is Joanne and her email is:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:billyandjoanne@...">billyandjoanne@...</a>  if you&#39;d like to email her.<br/>
