<div id="ygrps-yiv-444233795">I have a friend who is just beginning to look at some of the principles of peaceful parenting as viable options for her children. I recently posted the following article on Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.positive-parents.org/2011/07/whats-wrong-with-kids-today.html">http://www.positive-parents.org/2011/07/whats-wrong-with-kids-today.html</a><br/>
<br/>
She agreed with the principles, but wanted to know &quot;...where&#39;s the practical advice on how to handle a misbehaved child?&quot; My response was, &quot;Find the source of their acting out. It&#39;s usually from a need not being met. Once you find the source, you fix THAT. The behavior is only a symptom. If you&#39;re searching for other options besides spanking and time-outs, I&#39;d suggest visiting the following page, and then researching peaceful (or mindful) parenting. There ARE other options.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
She said she really liked Sandra&#39;s site, but is searching for more &quot;practical advice&quot; on how to do that. I thought about sending her here to read and ask questions, but I&#39;m not sure she&#39;s quite ready to embrace ALL of unschooling, and I&#39;m afraid she might end up overwhelmed. :)<br/>
<br/>
Could anyone direct me to other sites or articles that may have more practical application on how to parent peacefully? I&#39;m stymied. Thank you all!!!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1942484330">in addition to what meredith suggested, I’d suggest:<br/>
<br/>
“becoming the parent you want to be”<br/>
<br/>
and <br/>
<br/>
“parenting from the inside out”<br/>
<br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
“connection parenting”<br/>
