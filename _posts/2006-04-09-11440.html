<div id="ygrps-yiv-468446916">I pulled Courtney out of school mid year this year. We were having serious issues with her autistic brother not sleeping at night and being very loud and the school sending letters about excessive absences. <br/>
   <br/>
  I dont want her to go back, daddy dosent want her to go back, her doctor even calls her &quot; a good candidate for homeschool&quot;  but she is dead set on going back to school for first grade. Ive talked with her and tried to give her what she misses from school. no luck :( <br/>
   <br/>
  So do I step in and say no! Ive decided that you are not going to school. Or do I trust her to make her own decision as Ive done on everything else?  ( lol and pray that she is so sick of ps by the end of first grade she never wants to go back! ) <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Why does she want to go to school?  That should be the first thing to find<br/>
out.  It may be that she craves the structured time.  It might be to get<br/>
away from her brother.  It might be that she enjoys recess or lunch.  It<br/>
might be that she enjoyed all the hustle and bustle of kids.  It might be<br/>
that she believes she is doing something wrong by being unschooled.  All of<br/>
those things can be easily made up for by staying home.  If she is wanting<br/>
more structured time then help her structure her time.  If she is wanting to<br/>
get away from her brother, find activities that she can participate in that<br/>
don&#39;t include him (art, music, sports, play dates, etc.), if it is recess or<br/>
lunch then make going to a park a daily activity and pack a picnic lunch.<br/>
If it is being around a bunch of other kids find a resource or play group<br/>
for her to be involved with that meets weekly or more.  Even if it isn&#39;t an<br/>
unschooling group and just a regular homeschool group.  If she feels she is<br/>
doing something wrong because she is unschooled share with her what you have<br/>
learned and let her be around a lot of other home/unschooled kids so she<br/>
feels like she is part of a norm rather than a &quot;misfit.&quot;  If the majority of<br/>
her friends are still in school then help broaden her horizons she she has a<br/>
group of home/unschooled friends that she can relate to and realize that she<br/>
isn&#39;t missing out on anything and doesn&#39; thave that constant reminder that<br/>
she isn&#39;t in school.<br/>
