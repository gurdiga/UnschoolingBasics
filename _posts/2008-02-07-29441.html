I think a lot of families are going to have to learn how to live more frugally in leaner economic times.

No, we don&#39;t have the money. I was going to try to squeeze the 200.00<br/>
(because I&#39;m not giving one to John and not to Liam just because John<br/>
asked and Liam didn&#39;t.) out of my grocery money and see if I could go<br/>
without my Rx to get them for them. But that means I&#39;d be in a lot of<br/>
pain and wouldn&#39;t be able to work in the yard or do things around the<br/>
house. (I have lupus and fibro) So no I don&#39;t really have it, but I<br/>
was going to give what I had to make them happy. But to do that I&#39;d<br/>
need some help with the physical stuff because I&#39;ll be in too much<br/>
pain to do it myself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1138656311">Hey Karen,<br/>
<br/>
Can you see how it&#39;s possible that, whether or not you actually tell <br/>
them about a sacrifice you would make, they would *feel* any <br/>
resentment you may feel simply because it&#39;s in your heart?  It&#39;s <br/>
amazing how the folks we are closest to pick up unspoken things that <br/>
we are holding in our hearts.  That&#39;s one of the reasons why it&#39;s so <br/>
important for us to work on resentments and other icky feelings we <br/>
may be holding.  It works in the other direction, too.  Feeling <br/>
joyful and lighthearted is just as contagious as feeling resentful <br/>
and dejected and toxic!  (Please don&#39;t think I&#39;m assuming that you&#39;re <br/>
feeling resentful, dejected and toxic; I can only go by the Karen you <br/>
present in your emails, and that&#39;s who I&#39;m responding to; if what I&#39;m <br/>
saying doesn&#39;t fit, just, you know, blow me off!)  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Not that these joyful feelings should be forced, mind you, but you <br/>
can begin to get there just by feeling true gratitude for the things <br/>
(and not just material things but, you know, the many blessings) you <br/>
have in your life.  It&#39;s a great practice to get into with your kids, <br/>
who may really want to join you on their own.  Even if they don&#39;t, <br/>
they will likely benefit, as will you, from the joy you begin to feel <br/>
from this practice.  The incredible by-product is that amazing things <br/>
can happen when you start to shift the energy ~ I speak from personal <br/>
experience!!<br/>
<br/>
~Marji, who would be delighted to discuss this with you in more <br/>
detail off list, if you like.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1066222125">I think it is really sweet of you to want to give them what they want, but I<br/>
don&#39;t think you should have to suffer physically to give it to them.  We&#39;ve<br/>
hit on tough times financially lately as bills have gone up but not the<br/>
paycheck(yet) and I&#39;ve had to tell my three year old that we can&#39;t buy<br/>
things every time we enter a store and he is taking this very hard.  Luckily<br/>
the girls are older and are more understanding(they are 8 and almost 12).<br/>
It gets really tiresome telling Jackson no again and again and listening to<br/>
him throw fit after fit about it though.  Sometimes what he wants is little<br/>
even but if I can&#39;t buy a little something for everyone then I don&#39;t buy for<br/>
one or myself.   I would wait it out personally and let them know that you<br/>
want to be able to give it to them but that they  have to wait a little<br/>
while maybe you can squeeze a little somewhere over the next few months.  I<br/>
know this probably doesn&#39;t help to much but I do wish you luck.  Hugs, Shari<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-670290544">LOL! Are you sure? Sometimes I can be a complete bitch. Maybe you have<br/>
your moments too. Maybe not. But that&#39;s not really the point, is it?<br/>
<br/>
In another post adding another nugget of information that I hadn&#39;t<br/>
seen you mention earlier, you seem to think you can save $10 a week<br/>
toward this gizmo. I&#39;m not sure if that includes you being in pain<br/>
from skipping medication or not. <br/>
<br/>
Either way, if that&#39;s how tight things are, why make life that hard? <br/>
<br/>
I have been there and money stress is one of the worst and when we are<br/>
under stress about money that is the worst time to be making any sort<br/>
of decisions about things like how you are going to deal with your<br/>
kids when it comes to money. <br/>
<br/>
So, whether you think I am a bitch or you are ever a bitch -- give<br/>
yourself and the kids a break. Things are not important. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1291452656">Hi Ren,<br/>
   <br/>
  I remember in a post not that long ago you mentioned that you had some issues with emotional/verbal abuse early in your marriage, but not now.  Would you be able to share what made the difference?  What changed?<br/>
   <br/>
  I picked up the book &quot;The Verbally Abusive Relationship&quot; at the library after it was suggested by someone in this group, and it&#39;s rather discouraging how much of it fits for Ryan and I right now.  Especially since we have put rules to rest in our home, I have noticed Ryan getting triggered even more by all that is out of his control, and often it&#39;s me that takes the brunt of it.<br/>
   <br/>
  I would be happy for you to email me offlist if that&#39;s what you&#39;re comfortable with, or onlist if it could possibly help anyone else.  I don&#39;t have an issue at all with airing this in front of the group, since I would suspect that there is the odd other couple out there who has had a rocky time &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
   <br/>
  Thanks,<br/>
  Jodi  <br/>

   <br/>
  I agree with you on the Disney thing but then I&#39;ve never understood the appeal of such places. Skateboards, on the other hand, are sooooooooo worth it, imo. My oldest ds and all his friends skateboard. The grind rails and do kick flips and jump ramps (I&#39;m sure I&#39;m getting the terminology wrong...hehe) and I love to watch them. My ds just bought himself a rail and he and his friends have been setting it up in the street to do their stunts on. They take a very big old tire from our Jeep and stand it up behind the ramp and try to jump over it. Then my ds starts talking to me about how he&#39;d love to teach a class at the community college about the physics of skateboarding. So cool!<br/>
   <br/>
  All just my opinions, though. Someone else in my family may absolutely love Disney.<br/>

into a store you get to buy something, don&#39;t you?<br/>
<br/>
See the world through his eyes. What *he* sees is you choosing to buy  <br/>
many things and having loads of money to pay for them. Then when he  <br/>
wants something, you say you don&#39;t have the money. If 3 yos could  <br/>
swear, they&#39;d say WTF???? ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Way way better is to find a way not to take him shopping. He really  <br/>
can&#39;t understand right now and you&#39;re just tormenting him until he&#39;s  <br/>
old enough to grasp the concept.<br/>
<br/>
Or you can make a game of shopping, enlisting his help, asking him to  <br/>
help you decide between two things, picking out the cereal in the  <br/>
blue box. There are more ideas in the archives of the list.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it&#39;s inconvenient. But if we wanted convenience we shouldn&#39;t  <br/>
have had kids!<br/>
<br/>
What you&#39;re doing right now is withdrawing from your relationship  <br/>
every time you tell him no. Will he hate you by the time he&#39;s 6? No,  <br/>
but there *will* be damage to the relationship, especially in his  <br/>
trust of you. He already knows at 3 that you lie to him.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It gets really tiresome telling Jackson no again and again and  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If every single thing you wanted had to come from your husband and he  <br/>
was always saying no or weighing whether he thought the purchase  <br/>
worthy of his money, wouldn&#39;t you throw a fit eventually?<br/>
<br/>
See the world through *his* eyes and then you&#39;ll understand that he&#39;s  <br/>
reacting in a perfectly expected way to living in a world where he  <br/>
has so little control. And most of the control  he does have is  <br/>
illusory since it&#39;s granted by the parents and can be withdrawn at  <br/>
any time.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; don&#39;t buy for<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When we&#39;re generous with our kids, then they don&#39;t need to feel  <br/>
deprived when one gets something and another doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
And generous doesn&#39;t need to apply to money. Generous with our time.  <br/>
Generous with our help. When they know we&#39;re doing our best to help  <br/>
them then they don&#39;t need to resort to grasping at every opportunity  <br/>
to get something to fill a void in them because there won&#39;t be that  <br/>
vague void that they don&#39;t know how to fill.<br/>
<br/>

get what they want, this will be heard differently than a  <br/>
conventionally parented child who is granted what a parent decides to  <br/>
give.<br/>
<br/>
Family life runs *much* smoother when kids know mom and dad are their  <br/>
advocates and not the gateway that swings open and closed on what  <br/>
they want.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1093325171">It&#39;s not the Disney thing they want it&#39;s the Star Wars weekend that<br/>
they are excited about.  They LOVE Star Wars and are so excited about<br/>
this they could just burst.  It&#39;s worth the scrimping for this week<br/>
there for them to be as happy as they are going to be by it.  Besides<br/>
we are going to be seeing my brother and their cousins.  So they are<br/>
really excited all around.  But it&#39;s not Disney and the mouse that<br/>
they want.  We&#39;ve BTDT and it wasn&#39;t that great.  But the SW wow...we<br/>
aren&#39;t going until June but you&#39;d think it&#39;s next weekend for how<br/>
excited they are. =)<br/>

<br/>
  Thank you so much Joyce for this reponse.  It&#39;s so interesting that in this process with our children, I am also making much sense of my own childhood and the effects it has on me.  I&#39;ve done so much work already on this, but this is a new context.  I have food issues, never really feel full, always trying to fill the &quot;vague void&quot;.  SO much fodder for growth for our family...Ryan (dh) along with us too if it&#39;s what he chooses, and I hope he does.  Unschooling really does require looking at everything through a new lense, doesn&#39;t it?!?  My new motto (last month it was WWKD for what would Kelly do? &lt;g&gt;, this month I think it&#39;s &#39;question everything&#39;!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-893240449">BTW Karen, I noted something that was posted in passing and I didn&#39;t see<br/>
anything that followed up on it (actually two things):<br/>
<br/>
1 - you&#39;ve got an itty bitty one (new sister). That can affect SO much -<br/>
neither of the boys have YOU as much as they did before, things have to<br/>
stretch even further, and you&#39;re likely running on the ragged edge<br/>
sleepwise which can be rough in general and completely debilitating for<br/>
someone with lupus and fibromyalgia.<br/>
<br/>
2 - you also noted that you talked with them and John decided he can<br/>
wait to save for the top of the line model he wants and Liam is actually<br/>
just wanting a basic skateboard which is way more readily available. I<br/>
think that is what people were trying, in various ways, to get at: the<br/>
original post was a big either/or no other options BUT there were lots<br/>
of options. And, you sat down with them and figured out how to get what<br/>
they want without doing damage to yourself or going without absolute<br/>
necessities. THAT is exactly what it&#39;s about - working together to reach<br/>
goals mutually. And, once this way of doing things becomes habit, it can<br/>
be quite amazing. About a month ago, we went out looking for a Wii (did<br/>
I mention this already?) - not to be found anywhere even though we DID<br/>
have the money already collected up. DS was sad (so were we) and we all<br/>
commiserated about what a bummer it was at the SAME time we were looking<br/>
for alternatives (check online, check the Nintendo Wii-finder site,<br/>
etc). Nowhere for Wiis - not even on Canadian websites - except a few<br/>
places on eBay that were asking several hundred dollars more than it<br/>
retails for (and which we didn&#39;t have saved up). We decided to wait and<br/>
keep checking and keep saving. A few weeks later, a little saving and<br/>
extra refiguring and noting that the 40 gig PS3 was not much more<br/>
expensive than the Wii (the top of the line one is about double the<br/>
price though and that&#39;s where we had been aiming). The only difference<br/>
is that the low end one doesn&#39;t play PS2 games. We discussed it and<br/>
decided that since the PS2 we have is still in fine shape, we don&#39;t need<br/>
that ability necessarily so Go For It! The Wii is still on our List but<br/>
it&#39;s not at the top right now.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, also, it might help to actually have a written &quot;Stuff we&#39;d like to<br/>
get/do/try&quot; list - write it down, research estimated cost (the canning<br/>
supplies we want to get will cost about $60, the hot sauce DH likes that<br/>
is only available by ordering it from St. Croix costs $10 per bottle<br/>
plus $7.50 shipping, the Northeast Unschooling Conference will cost this<br/>
much, a weekend trip to here or there will cost about this much, etc) We<br/>
started doing this when DS was really young - as long as it was written<br/>
down, he could relax and know that it&#39;d happen and wouldn&#39;t get<br/>
forgotten (because he already trusted that we would do what we said we<br/>
would do).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1417733346">-=-=-=-<br/>
Especially since we have put rules to rest in our home, I have noticed Ryan<br/>
getting triggered even more by all that is out of his control, and often<br/>
it&#39;s me that takes the brunt of it.<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t exactly what you are looking for, but I got a lot like Ryan there<br/>
for awhile when I was trying to change. The least little thing would send me<br/>
into a hysterical fit. If I had been a toddler, it would be called a<br/>
tantrum.<br/>
<br/>
The absolute worst one was not all that long ago. Lilly (3.5) had had a<br/>
poopy accident and I was sooooooo mad at her. Boy did I let her know it too.<br/>
I yelled and screamed. I told her she was too old to have accidents, etc,<br/>
etc, etc. I was awful and am ashamed to admit it, but if it can help you<br/>
understand Ryan...<br/>
<br/>
My dh has a weak stomach so when he caught wind of the smell he started<br/>
gagging a bit. I was already yelling so suddenly my anger got directed at<br/>
him. I told him to stop it and that he was being ridiculous. How crazy was<br/>
that statement, lol?<br/>
<br/>
We had been talking and trying to change for a great many weeks and things<br/>
were stressful, etc. One of the things that we talked about is that I didn&#39;t<br/>
want him to let me walk all over him. I wanted him to start standing up for<br/>
himself.<br/>
<br/>
He did that night Lilly pooped her pants. He said something like &quot;You&#39;re<br/>
just saying that because you are pissed&quot;. I was so mad at him for saying<br/>
that. Then I was so happy with him. I laughed. I cried. I apologized to my<br/>
family. I begged for their forgiveness. We have only had one incident since<br/>
then and it was much less extreme.<br/>
<br/>
I guess this was a bit of a different perspective, but I hoped it helped a<br/>
little.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-210638772">And I have a nagging question in the back of my mind about how kids --<br/>
or any of us -- decide we want a trip to Disney or a new skateboard. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll have to catch up here and see if someone else has already touched<br/>
on this. <br/>
<br/>
But with these things being marketed the way they are, with a need on<br/>
my part to provide access to &quot;normal&quot; activities for my children as<br/>
they go through different ages and stages -- not wanting them to miss<br/>
out on the fun stuff just because they aren&#39;t in school hearing about<br/>
it, spending much of our TV viewing time skeptically analyzing how<br/>
commercials work on our minds, keeping an eye on the budget and having<br/>
the kids reasonably aware of limitations -- not stressed about money<br/>
but realizing it isn&#39;t a bottomless pit, easing from the age when a<br/>
cardboard box is a great toy into the &quot;I need the new gizmo the second<br/>
it comes out&quot; age into the &quot;dang, there aren&#39;t very many presents<br/>
under the tree for DS but the ones he got cost a ton and that&#39;s what<br/>
he preferred&quot; age while DD is still expecting to see a pile of<br/>
presents and doesn&#39;t care if they all came from the dollar store . . .<br/>
things bring up many conflicts and the conflicts change over time,<br/>
budgets change over time, and how the kids learn what to value is<br/>
influenced by me and DH over a very long time . . . none of it seems<br/>
to be a straight line, black and white issue.<br/>

was younger and then later I threw them away because all I heard was<br/>
noise.  What I wanted was for my whole family to communicate with me<br/>
where I wouldn&#39;t have to work so hard on broken &quot;equipment&quot; (my ears)<br/>
to understand them. $5k could have paid for things that brought us<br/>
together if I knew back then what I know now...<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We&#39;re not trying for perfect, just better! :-)<br/>
<br/>
The more day to day needs are anticipated and planned for the more  <br/>
willing kids are to give us some slack when we&#39;re caught in a bind.<br/>
<br/>
If we treat their time with respect, they will give us respect. If I  <br/>
&quot;need&quot; to impose on them several times a week then that&#39;s poor  <br/>
planning and they won&#39;t trust I&#39;m trying not to impose on them.  <br/>
They&#39;ll internalize that I don&#39;t value their time as much as my own.<br/>
<br/>
Once someone has stepped back from conventional parenting, it&#39;s  <br/>
flabbergasting how disrespectful of kids it is. And when kids are  <br/>
treated with disrespect, they treat others with disrespect. When kids  <br/>
see us working to not impose on them, then they are willing to go  <br/>
along when we can&#39;t see another way. But the more often we impose on  <br/>
them, the less willing they are to show respect for our needs when  <br/>
we&#39;re too often running rough shod over theirs.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Sometimes though we all have to wait.  like it or not.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which older kids can understand because they&#39;re older. We don&#39;t need  <br/>
to use life to teach it to them.<br/>
<br/>
And there are plenty of natural times when we have no control over  <br/>
needing to wait: like it&#39;s raining when they wanted a picnic. (And  <br/>
even then we can think outside the box. A picnic on the kitchen floor?)<br/>
<br/>
But the fewer times we put them in a position to wait when they  <br/>
believe we&#39;re in control and *could* choose not to make them wait  <br/>
(even if it&#39;s not true) the stronger the relationship.<br/>

Subject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] For Ren: Emotional/verbal abuse question<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Hi Ren,<br/>
<br/>
I remember in a post not that long ago you mentioned that you had some<br/>
issues with emotional/verbal abuse early in your marriage, but not now.<br/>
Would you be able to share what made the difference? What changed?<br/>
<br/>
I picked up the book &quot;The Verbally Abusive Relationship&quot; at the library<br/>
after it was suggested by someone in this group, and it&#39;s rather<br/>
discouraging how much of it fits for Ryan and I right now. Especially since<br/>
we have put rules to rest in our home, I have noticed Ryan getting triggered<br/>
even more by all that is out of his control, and often it&#39;s me that takes<br/>
the brunt of it.<br/>
<br/>
I would be happy for you to email me offlist if that&#39;s what you&#39;re<br/>
comfortable with, or onlist if it could possibly help anyone else. I don&#39;t<br/>
have an issue at all with airing this in front of the group, since I would<br/>
suspect that there is the odd other couple out there who has had a rocky<br/>
time &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Jodi <br/>

You&#39;re obviously struggling with this concept.<br/>
<br/>
You wrote:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;ve had to tell my three year old that we can&#39;t buy<br/>
&gt; things every time we enter a store and he is taking this very hard.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If I only have four dollars to my name and walk into a store with my <br/>
child and say, &quot;We can&#39;t buy things every time we enter a store.&quot;---and <br/>
then proceed to BUY toilet paper, I just LIED to him (I *did* buy <br/>
something: the toilet paper!). Generally we only go *into* stores to <br/>
BUY things (I&#39;m NOT a window shopper, so if *I* go in, I *will* buy <br/>
something!).<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t lie. I would say, &quot;I only have four dollars. Toilet paper costs <br/>
$3.78. With tax, I may have to scrape the bottom of my purse for the <br/>
total. Today, all we can afford is what&#39;s on the list. And the list <br/>
today is really, really short!&quot; I used to say that a LOT.<br/>
<br/>
Both my boys went through this stage of <br/>
I-want-everything-and-I-want-it-now. I think it&#39;s really, really normal <br/>
 from about three to nine or ten. Duncan, at almost 12, seems to have <br/>
grasped the concept sometime in the last two years. But before they <br/>
understood, I would always bring home a candy bar from the grocery---or <br/>
let them pick something out at the check out almost every time. It <br/>
wasn&#39;t always possible. Sometimes I really had only four dollars to my <br/>
name. Because they almost *always* got something, they understood when <br/>
I really *couldn&#39;t* afford something.<br/>
<br/>
I remember one time Cameron wanted something, and there was no $$. I <br/>
told him that I had no money right now. He suggested that I simply <br/>
write a check! &lt;G&gt; Duncan&#39;s taken a similar line: &quot;Can&#39;t you use your <br/>
debit card?&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The concept of &quot;no money&quot; just isn&#39;t real for them. &quot;Budget&quot; is a hard <br/>
concept too. Just because there&#39;s $500 in the bank today doesn&#39;t mean <br/>
that I can afford a PS2 *today*---that $500 has to cover groceries and <br/>
gas and the Charleston trip and....<br/>
<br/>
As they&#39;ve gotten older, it&#39;s really gotten easier. And they know I get <br/>
most of my $$ at the beginning of each month. So by the end of the <br/>
month, money&#39;s getting tight. We tend to *do* and buy more things at <br/>
the beginning of the month! &lt;G&gt; Now Dunc will ask what day of the month <br/>
it is before he asks for something, &#39;cause he knows that the <br/>
possibility is lower at the end of the month---unless I have a lot of <br/>
dogs scheduled.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway---We&#39;re taking issue with the lying. They will grow to <br/>
understand when you can afford it and when you can&#39;t. But with children <br/>
(as on this list! &lt;g&gt;), it&#39;s best to be really careful how we phrase <br/>
things!<br/>

<br/>
Possibly the root of some of the conflict? <br/>
<br/>
Not that I expect the 3-year-old to get it. <br/>
<br/>
But maybe a more balanced approach to shopping -- actually buying what you need when you need it if you can afford it and not splurging until there is nothing left? Planning a special purchase as if it were special and not just an excuse to shop?<br/>
<br/>
Over time maybe a more deliberate attitude toward using your money would get through to the 3-year-old -- make a lot more sense than the splurge and now we have nothing approach. <br/>
