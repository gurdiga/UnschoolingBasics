<div id="ygrps-yiv-1541722590">You know, I don&#39;t think of it in terms of being OK or not, just not<br/>
necessary. When a child is ready to read, you are right, instead of saying<br/>
that, they&#39;ll likely show signs. When they&#39;re ready to wean, they just<br/>
do...right? When they&#39;re ready to read...they just do! I mean, they&#39;ll read<br/>
street signs, labels, and such. They&#39;ll show interest in what you&#39;re<br/>
reading, maybe. You will see them reading, they will see you reading. The<br/>
analogy with weaning I guess is kind of reversed, since they are starting to<br/>
do something or show interest in something, as opposed to beginning to show<br/>
disinterest in nursing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>They will be learning to read all along. They will be learning about  <br/>
the structure of language from hearing and using it. They will absorb  <br/>
signs like STOP and McDonalds and &quot;Do you want to save?&quot;. They will  <br/>
build up the meanings of hundreds and hundreds of words.<br/>
<br/>
There are several brain areas involved in the process of reading.  <br/>
Those brain areas will be maturing at different rates and being used  <br/>
for other things so it&#39;s not just reading that will help them read.<br/>
<br/>
When all the brain areas are mature, they&#39;ll be able to decode and  <br/>
read. It&#39;s not something they need taught. It&#39;s something they will  <br/>
figure out.<br/>

without them.<br/>
<br/>
They can be fun for kids who like them. Just like any book. They can  <br/>
also be damaging if the parent thinks there&#39;s some key to reading in  <br/>
them that the child needs. There isn&#39;t.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Right. To make a counter analogy to weaning, learing about reading is <br/>
more like learning about food and eating than &quot;being ready to wean&quot; - <br/>
do you see the distinction I&#39;m making? Adults are still learing about <br/>
eating, and we&#39;re also still learing about reading. Its just not as big <br/>
and obvious to say &quot;hey, I learned what that logo stands for&quot; at 40 as <br/>
it is at 8.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve always been in favor of self-weaning and co-sleeping.  I&#39;ve always<br/>
handled criticism well, by saying (or just thinking), &quot;What do you think<br/>
I&#39;ll have a 18 year old who still wants to nurse, and sleep in bed with<br/>

and<br/>
sleep in their own beds when they are ready.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny how we can trust some things but have such a hard time with <br/>
others, isn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
As I was thinking this, I realized that many of you have said the same <br/>
thing<br/>
about your children learning to read.  You just trust that they will <br/>
learn<br/>
when they are ready.  Am I thinking about this the right way?  Is it the<br/>
same sort of trust I have, knowing that my children are ready to wean <br/>

sleep on their own?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yep.<br/>
<br/>
-==-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m making a correct analogy, then I wonder, what sort of support <br/>
should<br/>
I be giving my child?  When they are ready to wean or sleep on their <br/>
own, my<br/>
children give definite signs of readiness, as opposed to saying outright<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m ready to wean now.&quot;  (Although I don&#39;t doubt that some children <br/>
might<br/>
say this.  But mine never did.)  So do I, then, look for similar signs <br/>
for<br/>
reading readiness?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Kind of. But I remember when Duncan was just starting, he didn&#39;t really <br/>
show &quot;signs of readiness.&quot; It was more like showing &quot;signs of already <br/>
reading,&quot; on a small scale---or maybe a lower scale. He started <br/>
pointing out McDonald&#39;s signs on the highway. Or saying &quot;stop&quot; at stop <br/>
signs. He&#39;d ask what something said or asked what does _ _ _ _ spell? <br/>
It was very obvious he was making connections. And the connections <br/>
started to get overwhelming. Then they seemed to stop. Dead. Then <br/>
slowly we saw more ability. Then nothing. Then reading short books. <br/>
Then asking us to buy books. &lt;g&gt; Then seemingly no interest in words or <br/>
reading or books. Then more. Then almost no asking for help on video <br/>
games or computer games. Eventually it snowballed, and he can read <br/>
almost everything. And he writes online to gamers or in emails. With <br/>
help form us sometimes---sometimes he has it all just fine. Depends on <br/>
what he has to say. It&#39;s been VERY organic and fun to experience.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And when I see those signs, is that when it&#39;s ok to<br/>
present &quot;schooly&quot; looking things (as long as they are still <br/>
interested)?  Or<br/>
is it never ok to present these things?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Why do you feel the need to present &quot;schooly&quot; looking things? What kind <br/>
of things?<br/>
<br/>
I think it would depend on the child. We certainly talk a lot about <br/>
language and words and grammar here &#39;cause I like to. &lt;g&gt; We *play* <br/>
with words. But nothing has to actually look &quot;schooly&quot; to be effective <br/>
or helpful. It can just *be*.<br/>
