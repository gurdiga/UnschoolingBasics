<div id="ygrps-yiv-162353442">I think the last paragraph of that article sums up the problem.  The <br/>
problem isn&#39;t that these men aren&#39;t circ&#39;d, it&#39;s that they are very <br/>
promiscuous.  Sex isn&#39;t talked about in those cultures (I transcribe a <br/>
show that airs in Africa and they talk a lot about the AIDS epidemic <br/>
over there).  They just tend to have sex with as many women as possible, <br/>
whether they are married or not.<br/>

&gt; same<br/>
&gt; &gt; with not circumcising. if my boys want their penis cut they can decide<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2011118057">Lol....what a subject!<br/>
  Neither my spouse nor son are cut.<br/>
   <br/>
  My spouse due to his father requesting to see one preformed<br/>
  and all the information on them. <br/>
   <br/>
  My son due to speaking with a surgeon who specializes <br/>
  who felt they are totally unnecessary.<br/>
