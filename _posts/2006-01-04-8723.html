reading is still a struggle for him, I found a Sherlock Holmes audio <br/>
book for him to listen to (which he absolutely LOVED!) Or, another <br/>
example, my son told me he wanted to learn about Russia, so we went <br/>
to the library and I helped him pick out books on the subject, <br/>
videos, and a Russian language tape so he could hear what the <br/>
language sounds like. Whether he uses some, or all of it is entirely <br/>
up to him. Anyway, several of the locals say I&#39;m not an unschooler <br/>
because only the child should be allowed to choose what to learn, or <br/>
should choose the materials to learn with. (I should include that if <br/>
my son doesn&#39;t like something I&#39;ve introduced him to, I don&#39;t make <br/>
him continue it).<br/>
<br/>
The only textbook that we own is a math one, because we like it. We <br/>
don&#39;t have desks, chalkboards, or a schedule. We spend much of our <br/>
day learning about whatever is of interest to my son, doing projects, <br/>
and generally living our lives. <br/>

are, but any help would sure be appreciated! <br/>

You are who you are.<br/>
You live the way you want to live, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-296344795">&quot;Anyway, several of the locals say I&#39;m not an unschooler<br/>
because only the child should be allowed to choose what to learn, or<br/>
should choose the materials to learn with.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I agree with that part, but not the part about a parent never having <br/>
influencce.<br/>
You know, I&#39;ve heard about this attitude, but never encountered it in <br/>
real life.  Are you saying that you&#39;ve MET real live families that <br/>
argue this? Really?<br/>
<br/>
I find it a bit shocking, because children don&#39;t come into this world <br/>
knowing what is available, and if we just sit around waiting for them <br/>
to show an interest in something BEFORE we do anything, there&#39;d be an <br/>
awful lot of being at home I suppose.<br/>
I don&#39;t know anyone in real life that actually believes this, nor have <br/>
I encountered anyone online that truly believes it. <br/>
<br/>
I DO believe a child should choose exactly what to learn and the <br/>
materials to learn with, but I don&#39;t think that excludes a parent from <br/>
introducing ideas or offering options!!<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, my definition of unschooling is learning from life. If you&#39;re <br/>
doing that, and not making your child do any lessons or forced <br/>
anything (as far as &quot;education&quot;) then I&#39;d call you an unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
But if you hang out here for very long, you might hear some really <br/>
great arguements from those of us that have dropped required chores <br/>
and bedtimes.:)<br/>
<br/>
As far as labels, they aren&#39;t for putting yourself in a box, but they <br/>
ARE useful. If labels weren&#39;t useful, we might as well call a dog a <br/>
fish or flower or whatever we felt like, because heaven knows that dog <br/>
doesn&#39;t need a label!! Gasp, horrors.;)<br/>
<br/>
Labels are for identifying things and for understanding in a <br/>
conversation. The label unschooler doesn&#39;t really tell us much, but it <br/>
IS a useful tool for discussion. I do use the term homeschooler in the <br/>
general public, but with homeschoolers, I WANT them to know we don&#39;t <br/>
do school, so I prefer the term unschooler at that point.<br/>
Useful for conversation, those labels.<br/>

Maybe it truly isn&#39;t -- I don&#39;t know -- but when I was in the beginning of the journey, it sure did help to know where we fit in with various groups and for use in conversations with homeschoolers.<br/>
   <br/>
  So, with that said, I would say that you sound like an unschooler to me.  Perhaps not a radical one, but still an unschooler.  Introducing things to your son is great -- this is why so many unschoolers don&#39;t like the term child-led because it leads you to believe that a child must do all the discovering on his/her own without any influence from his parents.  You will find many unschoolers here who often share great things with their children because they think they will enjoy it -- this is called strewing:<br/>

If you&#39;re not giving assignments, grading, testing, and doing all  <br/>
those other school things and if you ARE supporting kids interests,  <br/>
providing a rich learning environment, facilitating kids pursuing  <br/>
their own passions -- then you&#39;re unschooling.<br/>

  ===========================================================<br/>

  Interesting thread.  I&#39;m wondering about families who DO &quot;let go&quot; of restrictions on food, bedtimes, TV and video games...wouldn&#39;t they be &quot;radical&quot; unschoolers?  And isn&#39;t THAT the difference?  That &quot;unschooling&quot; is a style of *homeschooling*, and &quot;radical unschooling&quot; is a whole way of life?  <br/>
   <br/>
  Either way, I think it&#39;s silly that people are debating your &quot;unschooly-ness&quot; (I know...no way *that* is a word)!  It&#39;s not really anyone else&#39;s business, is it?  As far as getting together with other families, you mightfeel more comfortable with other families who take a relaxed approach to homeschooling, or who are eclectic, or who are out and proud unschoolers, etc.  But I don&#39;t see how it matters IRL.  What are they gonna do...ban you from co-op?  Pin a scarlet letter on ya if they find that you ordered from a homeschool supply company? :-)<br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;m not trying to belittle your situation, obviously ...I just think our kids are often more &quot;with it&quot; than us adults, who can act pretty silly sometimes!<br/>
   <br/>
  Paige in VA...who&#39;s pretty sure we&#39;re radical unschoolers! &lt;BEG&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-120872490">I have found a good &quot;self test&quot; &lt;grin&gt;, is to ask yourself how you would feel if your son spent 2 weeks pretty much playing video games during all his waking hours.  What if he spent a year and never opened the math book?<br/>
<br/>
I think unschooling is difficult to define based on &quot;what you do&quot; because each child and family is so different with so many different interests.  My kids have a lot of &quot;chores&quot; but they chose to take them on themselves when they wanted to raise livestock for stockshows.  They could choose not to do shows tomorrow and the &quot;chores&quot; would stop, but as long as we have animals, they must be fed, groomed, pens cleaned, etc..  (These were family decisions made prior to ever getting animals, not some mandate by parents.)<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling has much more to do with attitudes toward what you do.  What if your son rolled his eyes at Sherlock Holmes?  Are you invested in  your son being &quot;exposed&quot; to that?  If my kids wanted to get rid of the animals and spend all day playing video games, I would have no problem (to be honest, some days I long for that.)<br/>

Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Am I an unschooler?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; This may seem like a stupid question, but honestly, I don&#39;t know <br/>
&gt; what <br/>
&gt; to call us. There even seems to be some debate among the other <br/>
&gt; homeschoolers/unschoolers in the area. I&#39;ll admit that it&#39;s taken <br/>
&gt; us <br/>
&gt; a few years to get to this relaxed point (all my fault, really, my <br/>
&gt; son doesn&#39;t have a problem with it at all ;) Now that we&#39;ve <br/>
&gt; arrived <br/>
&gt; to this point, I don&#39;t know what to say when people ask what we <br/>
&gt; are. <br/>
&gt; The &quot;regular&quot; homeschoolers in the area consider us unschoolers - <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; unschoolers can&#39;t seem to decide if we&#39;re eclectic, relaxed, or <br/>
&gt; one <br/>
&gt; of them (it all depends on who you&#39;re talking to). The &quot;regular <br/>
&gt; homeschoolers make no distinction between &quot;relaxed homeschooling&quot; <br/>
&gt; and &quot;unschooling&quot;.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Some don&#39;t view me as an unschooler because my son has a general <br/>
&gt; bedtime, has household chores, etc. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Some don&#39;t view us as unschoolers because I&#39;ll choose some things <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; introduce my son to. Ex: I LOVED to read Sherlock Holmes as a <br/>
&gt; child. <br/>
&gt; I thought my 10 y/o son would enjoy it, and since he is dyslexic <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; reading is still a struggle for him, I found a Sherlock Holmes <br/>
&gt; audio <br/>
&gt; book for him to listen to (which he absolutely LOVED!) Or, another <br/>
&gt; example, my son told me he wanted to learn about Russia, so we <br/>
&gt; went <br/>
&gt; to the library and I helped him pick out books on the subject, <br/>
&gt; videos, and a Russian language tape so he could hear what the <br/>
&gt; language sounds like. Whether he uses some, or all of it is <br/>
&gt; entirely <br/>
&gt; up to him. Anyway, several of the locals say I&#39;m not an unschooler <br/>
&gt; because only the child should be allowed to choose what to learn, <br/>
&gt; or <br/>
&gt; should choose the materials to learn with. (I should include that <br/>
&gt; if <br/>
&gt; my son doesn&#39;t like something I&#39;ve introduced him to, I don&#39;t make <br/>
&gt; him continue it).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The only textbook that we own is a math one, because we like it. <br/>
&gt; We <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t have desks, chalkboards, or a schedule. We spend much of our <br/>
&gt; day learning about whatever is of interest to my son, doing <br/>
&gt; projects, <br/>
&gt; and generally living our lives. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There may even be some general debate among you all as to what we <br/>
&gt; are, but any help would sure be appreciated! <br/>
