<div id="ygrps-yiv-966048871">I&#39;m a new member and watned to introduce myself.  I&#39;m Michele, I <br/>
have three girls (Kiah - 5, Lianna - 3 and Alisha - 1).  We had <br/>
originally planned to send Kiah to a Christian school for Kinder. <br/>
but had been leaning towards homeschool and decided to go for it.  <br/>
We just got started last week.<br/>
<br/>
I actually bought a whole curriculium and have since realized what a <br/>
mistake that was.  Math and reading books are way too easy for <br/>
her... science and history books are IMHO for an 8 year old, not a 5 <br/>
yo so she&#39;s bored with those and confused at the concepts.  <br/>
<br/>
I have been reading a lot about unschooling and am intrigued by the <br/>
concept.  I would love to know (besides this list) what other <br/>
resources I can access to learn more and see if it is for us.  I <br/>
know we will be more relaxed homeschoolers but not sure if <br/>
unschooling is the way we want to go.<br/>
<br/>
Any advice, tips or suggestions are much appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Michele</div>
