<div id="ygrps-yiv-1645836249">Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I live in Memphis, TN.  I saw this yahoogroups and wanted to jump on <br/>
here and see if anyone is from Memphis.  <br/>
<br/>
My family consist of: Myself (Amelia), my son Ravi age 12, my <br/>
daughter Priya age 8 and my daughter Lakshmi age 8.  We are <br/>
embarking on our second year of unschooling this year. I started out <br/>
unschooling my son back in 1996 when I arrived home with him from <br/>
India (he&#39;s adopted).  I knew when I put those soft organic cloth <br/>
diapers on him, that the status quo way of doing things was not <br/>
going to work for me or him.<br/>
<br/>
When he was around 4 years old, I got involved in the local <br/>
unschooling group, but that quickly went by the wayside.  <br/>
Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t have much in common with the currators of <br/>
the group.  It was hard to not have community support, but I kept <br/>
doing my thing.  I seperated from my husband in early 2002, and by <br/>
the summer of 2003, I was enrolled in massage therapy school.  I <br/>
made the decision to send my son to school.  Fortunately, it didn&#39;t <br/>
work out.  I say fortunately because I am glad he didn&#39;t become one <br/>
of those children who just quietly slipped through the cracks.  I <br/>
listened to his needs and in time realized if I didn&#39;t take a break <br/>
from school, I&#39;d lose my son to the proverbial cracks in the public <br/>
school system.  With the help of my sister, we managed to keep him <br/>
in constant care between us, while I finished up massage therapy <br/>
school.  It was not easy, it was in fact, the most difficult thing I <br/>
have done.  Not the coursework, but the lose of family time, and the <br/>
inability to focus on my childs homeschooling and my schooling at <br/>
the same time.  I finished as fast as I could.  Meanwhile, I never <br/>
sent him back to school after Christmas.  My sister kept him busy, <br/>
deschooled him for 3 weeks, then I was finished with the main part <br/>
of my school.  The rest of came in bits and chunks, when my parents <br/>
cared for the kids while I did massages.<br/>
<br/>
I felt the overwhelming pressure to send all three kids to school in <br/>
2005, when I was going through the divorce.  Lets just say it didn&#39;t <br/>
go well.  My kids began to tell me how much they wanted to be at <br/>
home, to unschool, to read all day if they wanted, and to make some <br/>
decisions, if not all decisions in their education.  I didn&#39;t have <br/>
faith it would happen, but I spent the summer planning what we would <br/>
do, how we would do it, and the kids even wrote stories about it.  I <br/>
was so touched that I began to look for ways (as a single mother <br/>
with very little income) to help their wishes come true.  I was <br/>
going against everything everyone in my family believed in.  <br/>
Everyone thought I should be in a job, getting health benefits, with <br/>
the children in school.  When time to enroll the children in school <br/>
came, I just couldn&#39;t do it.  I called the school to see if I could <br/>
enroll them after school started.  I learned I had so many days <br/>
before I would get contacted by the school for the children&#39;s <br/>
truancy.  <br/>
<br/>
It was the hardest month of my life, because I felt like I literally <br/>
needed to jump out and just do it.  I did.  My kids were so happy!<br/>
<br/>
We have again reached out to the local unschoolers group, and the <br/>
support is minimal.  I do have a couple of new friends, who are <br/>
involved in the group. I am ready to find more support, whether <br/>
local or via internet.  <br/>
<br/>
I have so many questions, and would love to know about other <br/>
single/divorced mothers who are doing this.  I may have legal issues <br/>
in the future regarding unschooling, as the children&#39;s dad is no <br/>
longer in agreement with homeschooling.  He said he wanted the <br/>
children to go to public school again, but after my son being choked <br/>
(around the neck) by another student when they last attended, I do <br/>
not plan to place them in school period.  <br/>
<br/>
So, if you have any ideas for me, or just a nod of support, please <br/>
share it. <br/>
<br/>
If you live in Memphis, I am organizing an Unschooling Art Exhibit <br/>
just for the kids, at the end of August.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading this!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1025984552">I expect you will learn from this group, but I came across  a yahoo  <br/>
support group that may be just what you are looking for<br/>
crazylifeunschoolers. You may want to join them. The description  <br/>
follows:<br/>
<br/>
Description:<br/>
Unschooling and gentle parenting are challenging. Working toward these  <br/>
goals in an &quot;alternative&quot; family environment can be overwhelming at  <br/>
times. This is a support/idea group for those striving to radically  <br/>
unschool and parent respectfully within a less traditional family:  <br/>
singles, grandparents, foster families, adopted, divorced, nannies,  <br/>
more than two parents, one or more kids in school, etc., with a common  <br/>
theme being the need to rely on other, more conventionally minded  <br/>
adults and the impact that has on our lives and relationships.<br/>
<br/>
Best of Luck :),<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-283951065">Hi.  I have a great friend who lives about an hour from you in Jackson and<br/>
is very involved in the art community there.  She is not an unschooler but<br/>
homeschooled her youngest two who were going to drop out if she didn&#39;t<br/>
homeschool them because they hated the cultural differences in school,<br/>
coming from Jersey to TN (bible belt etc).   She is culturally very aware<br/>
and eclectic.  Her kids are all grown, but she is very much involved with<br/>
sharing art with anyone, and curates an art program/ contest for high school<br/>
kids every year.  I forget the name of it.  And since she so socialable she<br/>
might know people for you and your kids to hang out with close to your<br/>
area.<br/>
