<div id="ygrps-yiv-631127633">Hi<br/>
My DD10 has just created her own unschooling blog and webring and is very keen for people to join so I promised her I would post a message on some of my mailing lists (also a push for my blog).  <br/>
I think the main attraction is people posting comments (which I can totally relate to!  LOL). So if anyone knows any kids with blogs or just wants to come have a look at hers, I&#39;m sure DD would be truly grateful.<br/>
