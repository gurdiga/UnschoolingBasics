<div id="ygrps-yiv-1058486398">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;So my problem is how do you just suddenly let go and TRUST that<br/>
you&#39;re doing the right thing and the kids will learn what they <br/>
need?&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Something that is very difficult to do but I have been trying to do, <br/>
with ALL areas of my life is ask this question &quot;If there were no other <br/>
voices around me (society) how would I think about ______ ?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
In other words, try and start with a blank canvas, forget about what <br/>
society says you should or shouldn&#39;t do, about what kids should or <br/>
shouldn&#39;t know, how kids should or shouldn&#39;t be behaving, what is your <br/>
gut instinct about things?  I know I have stopped myself from buying a <br/>
particular piece of clothing because of that inner voice in my head <br/>
that thinks &quot;What would someone else think of this?&quot;  I am learning <br/>
better and better to be true to myself and my OWN inner feelings about <br/>
things.  It has helped me quite a bit in better trusting my children.<br/>
<br/>
My goal is not to have these &quot;smart&quot;, &quot;well-behaved&quot; children but to <br/>
have an awesome relationship with my children and to have healthy, <br/>
happy, joyful children who are doing the things they love!!  The most <br/>
successful people are not those that are making great money and have <br/>
all these nice things, the successful ones are those that are HAPPY <br/>
and joyful doing the things they love to do!  The ones that are LIVING <br/>
life!!! <br/>
