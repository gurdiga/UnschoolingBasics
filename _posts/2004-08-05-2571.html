So  my next question would be how do I start giving myself permission to  just<br/>
DO something that intrigues me without proof of my long term  interest?<br/>

CERTIFICATE OF EMPOWERMENT<br/>
<br/>
As bearer of this certificate you are no longer required to depend on the  <br/>
advice of experts. You may step back and view the entire world-not just your  <br/>
home, neighborhood or town, but the whole Earth-as a learning experience, a  <br/>
laboratory containing languages (and native speakers thereof), plants, animals,  <br/>
history, geology, weather (real live weather, in the sky, not in a book), <br/>
music,  art , mathematics, physics, engineering, foods, human dynamics, and ideas  <br/>
without end. Although collections of these treasures have been located in  <br/>
museums for your convenience, they are to be found everywhere else, too.  <br/>
This authorizes you to experiment; to trust and enjoy your kids; to rejoice  <br/>
when your children surpass you in skill, knowledge or wisdom; to make <br/>
mistakes,  and to say &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Furthermore, you may allow your children to  <br/>
experience boredom without taking full responsibility for finding them something  <br/>
to do.  <br/>
Henceforth you shall neither be required nor expected to finish everything  <br/>
you start. Projects, books, experiments and plans may be discontinued as soon <br/>
as  something more interesting comes along (or for any other reason) without  <br/>
penalty, and picked up again at any time in the future (or never).  <br/>
You may reclaim control of your family&#39;s daily life, and take what steps you  <br/>
feel necessary to protect your children from physical, emotional or social <br/>
harm.  <br/>
You have leave to think your own thoughts, and to encourage your children to  <br/>
think theirs.  <br/>
Each person who reads and understands this is authorized to extend these  <br/>
privileges to others, by reproducing and distributing this certificate or by  <br/>
creating another of his/her own design. Those who don&#39;t feel the need to obtain  <br/>
approval to experiment, to think, or to do things they&#39;ve never seen others do <br/>
 are exempt, as they didn&#39;t need permission in the first place. <br/>

Who is not going to think with regret about the scrap booking supplies in my<br/>
cupboard, because they will NOT go back and who is going to order the<br/>
Rosetta Stone CD for Spanish as we are planning a trip to the Canaries in<br/>
Jan and I have always wanted to learn Spanish and I am not going to worry<br/>
about whether or not I &quot;use&quot; it enough to justify the expense!<br/>
