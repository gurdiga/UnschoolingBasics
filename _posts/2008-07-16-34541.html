<div id="ygrps-yiv-2135788204">Folks on this list 7 or 8 months ago helped so much as we were <br/>
deschooling. It took a year instead of 4 months (like I had planned) <br/>
to get past negativity, need for all-day zoning out, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Now my 11 yo son says he is tired of doing what he has been doing - <br/>
that he wants to learn. You can only imagine my amazement and <br/>
elation. He is asking to learn things, cracking open books (even a <br/>
geometry book!), willingly meeting new people, etc. This came on <br/>
gradually, but especially kicked up the last couple of weeks. I want <br/>
to offer many many thanks to all who offerred help, support, advice <br/>
when I was in my crazies about watching tv all day.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m struggling a little to shift gears, as he is wanting different <br/>
things like more social interaction, kinesthetic learning <br/>
(blacksmithing is the new interest), and I&#39;m not sure what. It seems <br/>
like he is in an awkward place of being bored with tv and not wanting <br/>
to sit with a book, but not knowing how to learn things otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing that some of this is behind his saying that he wants to <br/>
go to school. School would be ok if he gets into a school (for which <br/>
he is wait-listed) that is safe and well-run.<br/>
<br/>
Since that is not a big possibility, I am assuming (and happy) that <br/>
he will stay with homeschooling. He still does not want to sit still <br/>
for anything except tv/nintento/computer. I&#39;d love for his education <br/>
to include books and conversation a bit more. Sometimes I read to him <br/>
while he jumps on the bed, does sommersaults, etc. I&#39;m almost <br/>
thinking of it as a game to see how much we can homeschool, and how <br/>
much he can learn before the official school year starts.  Any ideas <br/>
on how to help him where he is now?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1822718985">Try to locate events with blacksmithing.... reenacting museums or<br/>
plantations have these.  There may be some in your area or region.  Or even<br/>
getting in touch with university professors teaching metalsmithing and see<br/>
if any of them know blacksmithing or someone who does... or maybe ask the<br/>
art department if you can&#39;t get hold of a professor during the summer to<br/>
have one call you with that info.  I know a guy in TN who loved<br/>
blacksmithing and ironwork, and he worked for a local shop (really sort of a<br/>
factory) after he completed some coursework in metalsmithing.  They made<br/>
iron gates.  Maybe just talking around with some of these folks with your<br/>
son would be a good start.  They might have a some good suggestions that<br/>
would appeal to your son.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1567882926">He could maybe check your local public library (they may have a  <br/>
website and/or online catalogue), so he can find some videos or DVDs  <br/>
and/or audio books (books on CD) on things that interest him. He could  <br/>
also telephone the library or just drop by to see what they have.  <br/>
(Most libraries can bring in things from other libraries (interlibrary  <br/>
loan) if they do not own something he wants).  Audio books might be  <br/>
good for him to listen to on whatever portable listening devise (with  <br/>
headphones if he likes) he can access or owns. Are there any local  <br/>
museums or historical villages with actors re-creating blacksmithing  <br/>
(coopering (barrel making) might interest him too, depending on what  <br/>
he likes about blacksmiths), or local ferriers he could visit?  Is it  <br/>
the fire/heat, the making of things or maybe the horses he likes?   <br/>
There is, for example, a website for the Artist-Blacksmith&#39;s  <br/>
Association of North America (www.abana.org) which maybe of interest/ <br/>
inspiration. I think the key thing is for you to support him while he  <br/>
explores his interests, and to have a strong relationship with him.<br/>
<br/>
