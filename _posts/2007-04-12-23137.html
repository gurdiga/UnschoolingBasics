<div id="ygrps-yiv-1551169727">hi!  i am a newbie to the group and just wanted to introduce myself.  <br/>
i am the mother of a non-sleeping yet rarely fussy, curious, loving, <br/>
smiley little 6 month old boy who has been unschooled from the start!  <br/>
all that i know about unschooling seems to fit exactly with how we <br/>
feel life should be lived and learning should be embraced.  as we are <br/>
still (and always will be) learning ourselves, i am very excited to <br/>
join this group.  baby is waking up so i gotta run!<br/>
