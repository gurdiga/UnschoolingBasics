<div id="ygrps-yiv-1035948406">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
We recently went through the rather sudden death of my father, who (along<br/>
with my mother) had recently moved to our town and built a little house in<br/>
our back yard this past year.  One book that we liked that was given to us<br/>
by friends is called &quot;The Fall of Freddie the Leaf&quot; by Leo Buscaglia.<br/>
Another older one that I really like is called &quot;About Dying:  An open<br/>
family book for parents and children together&quot; by Sara Bonnett Stein --<br/>
though it was published in 1974 and might be harder to acquire.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps, sorry for the loss of your daughter&#39;s grandfather.<br/>
<br/>
