<div id="ygrps-yiv-1193886026">I totally blew up at dd tonight.  The kids were all having a good <br/>
time together while dd played Jumpstart.  Suddenly, she bites Logan&#39;s <br/>
finger, totally unprovoked.  Then she laughed at him while he was <br/>
crying.  OMG, I was so pissed off.  In my mind, I am saying &quot;focus on <br/>
the victim, focus on the victim&quot;  But at the same time, I kept <br/>
thinking about what I just witnessed and totally lost it.  I got up <br/>
turned off her game and ordered her to her room.  When she protested, <br/>
I told her if she didn&#39;t get up there, I was going to spank her.  She <br/>
tried to tell me again what happened, and I told her it was bullshit, <br/>
and to get upstairs.  I did everything that I have been working so <br/>
hard to change.  She came back downstairs crying, and still in <br/>
authoritive mode, I ordered her back upstairs.  She said that she <br/>
just wanted to tell Logan she was sorry.  I started to come to my <br/>
senses, and said of course you can apologize.  She told Logan she was <br/>
sorry, kissed him, and asked if he was okay.  When I looked for her <br/>
next, she was gone.  I went upstairs to talk to her because I <br/>
realized I had really blown it.  I told her I was sorry for <br/>
everything I did.  She then explained to me that it was a play bite <br/>
that was too hard on accident.  She was laughing because she was <br/>
trying to cheer him up and get him to laugh also.  After she told me <br/>
her version of events, it all made perfect sense.  My kids play a <br/>
little rough sometimes and give bite kisses.  They let each other <br/>
know when they get too rough.  I have also seen them cheer each other <br/>
up by being silly and laughing.  I feel like a big fat idoit.  I <br/>
couldn&#39;t see past my perspective, and refused to give her a chance to <br/>
defend herself.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1713806437">Another &quot;learning-take&quot; for ya!<br/>
<br/>
Opportunities for growth and change abound. You&#39;ll know if you need to<br/>
look deeper at any part of this - your beliefs about kids, how your<br/>
siblings treated you, etc. if it&#39;s ever time to do that. YAY! for<br/>
do-overs and reconnecting after screwups.<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>
