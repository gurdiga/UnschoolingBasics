<div id="ygrps-yiv-35051776">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I joined the list pretty recently, and sent out an introduction email  <br/>
about a week ago.  I have a question about my 4 year old daughter,  <br/>
Paige (actually, I have a lot of questions, but I&#39;ll limit it to this  <br/>
one to start!).<br/>
<br/>
Paige has recently developed many habits, possibly tics (like her  <br/>
older sister, Tess (7 years old) who has TS).  One of them is  <br/>
constant picking of boo-boos.  She has many of them on her body  <br/>
(mostly on her legs, her tushie and one behind her ear) at this  <br/>
point.  All of which started from a tiny dot of a boo-boo, many of  <br/>
them are now up to 1 cm in width.  Sometimes I can see blood dripping  <br/>
from them.  Sometimes I find blood stains on her pant legs or on the  <br/>
back of her underwear.<br/>
<br/>
A few months ago, she started licking her lips excessively, and  <br/>
developed a huge ring around her mouth.  I knew (from past experience  <br/>
with Tess), that there was not much I could do about it, and at first  <br/>
I offered her unpetroleum jelly or lip balm.  She started to become  <br/>
sensitive to it, so I backed off, told her she knew her body and  <br/>
could decide if she needed to put something on her sores.   I can say  <br/>
that the sores around her mouth have alternated between getting  <br/>
better or getting no worse than before, so I think it was a good  <br/>
strategy.  So, I tried the same approach with the boo-boos, but it&#39;s  <br/>
not working.  Lately, it&#39;s really making me crazy to see them  <br/>
bleeding and getting bigger so I&#39;ve been reminding her to stop  <br/>
picking, and she gets really mad at me.<br/>
<br/>
I do have a personal history with this particular topic in that I was  <br/>
a pretty neglected child, and one of the ways in which I remember  <br/>
this most clearly was that I had tiny sores that grew into gigantic  <br/>
boo-boos on my tush.  I was not as young as Paige, I was probably 7  <br/>
or so.  I picked them until they bled, and I remember thinking they  <br/>
would go away each time I picked them off.  They got bigger and  <br/>
bigger until my whole backside was a huge scab.  Finally I &quot;allowed&quot;  <br/>
it to be discovered by my grandmother, at a sleepover at her home.  I  <br/>
remember an ER trip after that, I also remember my father often  <br/>
saying to me (even into adulthood) that I &quot;hid my illnesses from  <br/>
them&quot; (which I did - not just in this case, but in other ways too),  <br/>
and I took the &quot;shame&quot; of this into my adulthood, until I one day  <br/>
realized that I WAS A KID and no one was looking after me!<br/>
<br/>
Even though, I know that I am looking after my kids, I&#39;m sure part of  <br/>
my reaction could be about being really, really sure that I am not  <br/>
neglecting them the way that I was.  But, I do think that even  <br/>
without my personal history with this particular issue, I still feel  <br/>
like this is something I want to try to help her to stop doing - I  <br/>
worry that she will have scars, or they could become infected.   <br/>
Sometimes I try to stop her from doing it, which makes her really mad  <br/>
(and we have some other stresses in our relationship, which I&#39;m sure  <br/>
I&#39;ll post in the future, so fighting over boo-boos is not really  <br/>
helping us!  In short, I&#39;ve been stressed out lately, and have not  <br/>
been the parent I would like to be).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, sometimes I think I should just totally let it go, and she  <br/>
will work it out.  Today, she tried to hide the fact that she had  <br/>
picked a boo-boo from me (she told me that she didn&#39;t know where the  <br/>
blood on her finger came from, with totally wide open &quot;trust me&quot;  <br/>
eyes).  I told her that it didn&#39;t matter to me if she did, I just  <br/>
wanted to see the one that was picked, to see if was okay.  She  <br/>
really insisted that she hadn&#39;t picked at all.  Yikes!  I know she is  <br/>
feeling pretty bad about this to say that to me.<br/>
<br/>
Last night we were watching a TS video with Tess and one of the  <br/>
children mentioned a tic where he was scratching the same spot over  <br/>
and over, until it bled.  I asked Paige tonight if she feels like she  <br/>
has to pick them.  She said that &quot;her body tells her too&quot; (similar  <br/>
answer to what Tess would say about her tics).  I&#39;ve recently thought  <br/>
that Paige might also have tics, but it never occurred to me until  <br/>
today that the boo-boo picking could be one of them.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I would love to hear what people on this list think about  <br/>
this.  It probably seems like a small problem, but I wonder if it&#39;s a  <br/>
good example of the type of power-struggle I can get into with my  <br/>
children.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-906463152">Reading your post I came to realize tht I did some of the things your dds do like picking on my behind, my upper arms and chewing the inside of my lips ( and I did it a lot!) . I think I did it because I was anxious. My anxiety was because of my parents relationship. It was good but there were issues and it made us insecure. Kids can feel and know everything. Once you start picking and you make a sore it is hard to stop. I still did it thru adulthood but I learned to stop and control it now( at 41) . Thank god I did not have a label or felt guilty about it. No pressure form my parensts helped.<br/>
Is there a reason (other than the  possibility they have TS) that your dds have any kind of anxiety  source in their lives??? Remeber that kids can hear everything we think they don&#39;t<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-870863857">I have a 14 year old and a 7 year old, both adhd/aspergers and with <br/>
that comes tics and ocd. My 7 yo picks/scratches his ear until it <br/>
bleeds, if he&#39;s not doing that, his &quot;anxiety&quot; will manifest itself in <br/>
some other way like verbal tics, or thinking bugs will fly up his nose. <br/>
My oldest wasn&#39;t that bad, although we had him on ritalin from age 7 <br/>
until age 12. I took him off of all meds and he does just fine without, <br/>
of course we homeschool now so it&#39;s not an issue. Ritalin brought out <br/>
tics in him, whereas my youngest has them anyway. Meds can help with <br/>
tics, but I choose to let mother nature take her course. Maybe kids <br/>
like this have something to teach us about life and if we mask it with <br/>
drugs, we&#39;ll never learn anything. Anyway, way off topic, I&#39;ll get off <br/>
my soap box now.<br/>
<br/>
I have learned that with my 7 yo, that if I curb one ocd behavior, it <br/>
will turn into another. Which one is worse? Hearing him <br/>
say &quot;tsssskkkkk, tsssskkk, tsssssk&quot; or watching him pick his ears until <br/>
they bleed. I choose the verbal one and I don&#39;t draw attention to it <br/>
and so he doesn&#39;t do it that much.<br/>

Sometimes scabs do itch when they&#39;re healing.  Perhaps that&#39;s why she&#39;s <br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Hi Leslie, My daughter has picked her boo-boos in the past also. I <br/>
found that if I let her pick out her favorite bandaids, like barbie <br/>
or sponge bob, and but some neosporin on it, that keeps her from <br/>
picking on it. I let her use as many bandaids as she likes and it <br/>
does keep them from getting infected and scarring. Just an idea. She <br/>
is seven also. Staci (in NY)</div>
