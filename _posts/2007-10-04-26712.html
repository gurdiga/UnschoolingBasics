<div id="ygrps-yiv-225846146">Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
My 7 yr old is subscribe to the Disney Toon Town game. We&#39;re just <br/>
wondering if anyone&#39;s kid is also part of this community, as my son <br/>
is &quot;desperate&quot; to test out the &quot;True Friend&quot; function. A True Friend is <br/>
where you give each other this secret code, that allows you to chat <br/>
with each other in secret language, within the Disney Toon Town <br/>
community that only you and your this True friend understand.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m posting the link here, just incase anyone&#39;s interested, as you can <br/>
try it for free. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-3973637">My kids are both on that.  Although we haven&#39;t been playing it much lately.<br/>
Quentin has been too busy playing Halo 3, LOL.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve never used the True Friend feature, but we&#39;d love to try.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1907083875">My daughter plays on Disney and i think it would be great to get the kids<br/>
involved with this so they can learn how to chat online through a SECURE<br/>
site with parent involvement. Lets get together to think of a PW that would<br/>
easy for the kids to remember as well as the parents.<br/>
