<div id="ygrps-yiv-172440263">Hello all,<br/>
I am new to this but am so grateful and relieved for<br/>
the choice we have made to unschool our boys, 7 and 3.<br/>
We have come up against alot of opposition...more on<br/>
that at another time, but I KNOW in my heart what is<br/>
right.<br/>
Speaking of parenting methods:  I got the 1-2-3 magic<br/>
program about a year and 1/2 ago.  We tried it.  It<br/>
sucked.  I am so glad to finally find people who &quot;get&quot;<br/>
my methods.  I did not have a name or label for it,<br/>
but I am now at least able to be a part of a community<br/>
of free thinking people. Thanks for letting me be a<br/>
part.<br/>
Heather<br/>
