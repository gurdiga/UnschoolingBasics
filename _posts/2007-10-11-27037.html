<div id="ygrps-yiv-1654219076">Thanks!!<br/>
Lol, your definition fits me so well as I sit here and listen to my almost ten year old ramble...<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t think of any discussion that has ever come up since knowing they were with me, that they<br/>
weren&#39;t included in.  ~~15 minute pause while we debate the value of leather ~  For example:<br/>
When I was expecting my first, my spouse didn&#39;t want to know the sex, soooo, I mentioned the<br/>
appointment but let him know he didn&#39;t have to come....so he didn&#39;t...I *felt* I already knew, but why not?<br/>
He threatened me that I&#39;d better not have found out so I smiled and walked away.  <br/>
When it came to baby names, he refused to address the topic towards boys names so I told him if<br/>
it was a boy unless he said different, he would have his name.  So Then I was left to figure out a girls name.<br/>
Many were rolled over the tongue, a few jotted down and tasted a few times, none grabbed.<br/>
<br/>
Then one day when I was about six months along, we were discussing names and her father came up with <br/>
Caylee.  So being me, I asked my baby-to-be if she liked the name Caylee.  It was the ONLY time I got this <br/>
positive rap, kinda like saying,&#39;Yes! Yes!  That&#39;s my name!&#39; So she is named.    <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-172928179">I have been wondering too. That explains so much! I<br/>
was so confused when I met other unschoolers and then<br/>
found out that they limit their kids in things like<br/>
TV, food etc. etc. So I guess I am a Radical now,<br/>
