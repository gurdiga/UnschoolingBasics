<div id="ygrps-yiv-1069490931">&quot;If not, what can I do? My big thing is getting typing/computer time. EVERY time, <br/>
like right now, I sit she wants mama milk...is 2.5 too young for me to refuse? <br/>
I&#39;m really feeling conflicted about this, and sometimes resentful. I want to do <br/>
what&#39;s best for dd, and usually give in.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think a change in the way you see things might help in this situation. Instead of seeing yourself as &quot;giving in&quot;, see it as an opportunity to spend time with a small child that desperately needs you. Yes, I think 2.5 is an exhausting age in many ways, you have to be available at all times it seems, with little time left for yourself. But there ARE ways to meet your needs and hers...you just have to be more creative in those young years.<br/>
Like setting her up with a great movie and some popcorn before you sit down to type, and expecting to get interrupted will help you detach from that moment when it comes.<br/>
Personal boundaries ARE about being honest with what you really want to do, yes....but when a child is very young they need us more and I think it&#39;s really useful to try and detach ourselves from what is happening and be accepting. <br/>
This is what she needs right now. This is where your life is right now. Instead of longing for something you don&#39;t have, accept that this moment is perfect, just the way it is. Needy 2 year old and all.<br/>
<br/>
I often look at things through the perspective of death. Maybe that seems morbid to some, but seeing myself as dead and gone keeps me thinking clearly about what I really want from moment to moment.<br/>
Or reminding myself that I may not always have that needy toddler with me, or that grumpy teen....keeps me thankful that they are with me, that they are healthy and happy and I get more moments with them today.<br/>
Today is perfect.<br/>
This very moment is perfect.<br/>
This may be the very most perfect moment ever, why mess it up wishing things were any different than they are right now?<br/>
It&#39;s a very Zen-like way of seeing your life. Unschooling is my Zen.:)<br/>
<br/>
Personal boundaries for me, with a toddler, are about not letting someone hurt me, letting that little person know when their voice is hurting my ears or I don&#39;t like the way in which they&#39;re talking to me.<br/>
&quot;Jalen, when you say it that way I feel grumpy, can you just tell me NO without screaming?&quot;<br/>
He usually calms right down and says &quot;no&quot; much more softly.:)<br/>
I assume that I am on call at all times with small people in my home...acceptance is a wonderful tool.<br/>
<br/>
You can creatively work it so you get time to  do that which you love....truly. It just takes a proactive method to get to a place where you have some free time. While they&#39;re asleep is one really great time.:)<br/>

****** There were no computers when Laurie was 2.5; we didn&#39;t get <br/>
one until she was 11. Even then, it was several years before I had <br/>
time to use one. I have a few thoughts on the way you&#39;re looking at <br/>
the &quot;interruptions.&quot; :-)<br/>
<br/>
If you change the way you look at things; the things you look at <br/>
will change. (Wayne Dyer)<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t see ______ as an acceptable interruption when Laurie needed <br/>
me to nourish her - spiritually, physically or otherwise. Fill in <br/>
the blank as you choose. Anything and everything will fit.<br/>
<br/>
When we see our children&#39;s needs as interruptions, they feel it. <br/>
She&#39;s learning that your computer time is more important to you than <br/>
nourishing her. Maybe mama milk isn&#39;t what she REALLY wants. Maybe <br/>
she needs to know that she is number one to you, right then, when <br/>
she needs to know it, no matter what you&#39;re doing. Being a child is <br/>
scary and removing all scariness is a time-consuming job for a <br/>
parent, but it&#39;s a job with more benefits than you can imagine - <br/>
benefits that will become obvious to you as she gets older.<br/>
<br/>
My Laurie is 24 now and recently moved away to pursue her PhD.   <br/>
Last night, I finally sat down at the computer to attempt to write <br/>
some notes to help me with my speech in Peabody this weekend. I <br/>
didn&#39;t intend on putting it off until the last minute, but it <br/>
couldn&#39;t be helped.<br/>
 <br/>
Well, I had been typing for about a minute and a half (seriously) <br/>
and the phone rang. It was Laurie, bubbling over with news about her <br/>
first day in some of her classes. She started describing each <br/>
professor that she&#39;ll be working with, the classroom, etc. I reached <br/>
up and minimized what I had typed so I wouldn&#39;t be distracted from <br/>
her phone call. She babbled and shared and &quot;interrupted&quot; me for over <br/>
an hour. She told about her grocery shopping trip and how she found <br/>
organic apples at the Winn Dixie.<br/>
 <br/>
Then she told me how much she loved me and how much it meant to her <br/>
that I always had time for her, in the past and now. She <br/>
said, &quot;Knowing you, you were right in the middle of something <br/>
important...but I&#39;ll never know about it, huh?&quot; I laughed and told <br/>
her that nothing was more important to me than hearing from her. <br/>
(I&#39;m SO grateful for cell phones) She said, &quot;Yeah, I am pretty <br/>
wonderful, huh?&quot;  Yeah, she is.<br/>
<br/>
Would you see that as an acceptable interruption since we&#39;re living <br/>
apart for the first time in 24 years and of course we&#39;re missing <br/>
each other! Would you still see it as acceptable if you knew it <br/>
happened every day? It does. <br/>
<br/>
I miss the times when she crawled onto my lap for nourishment, but <br/>
as far as I&#39;m concerned she&#39;s really still doing that, and there is <br/>
nothing that will ever be more important to me than giving her <br/>
nourishment. I figure that I was put on this earth to be Laurie&#39;s <br/>
mom and anything else is lagniappe (cajun french word for &#39;extra&#39;).<br/>
<br/>
 If it means that I only have a few hours to throw together some <br/>
notes for my speech at the Live & Learn conference, then the parents <br/>
there will understand, realize and KNOW that my speech about Laurie <br/>
isn&#39;t as important as Laurie herself. I&#39;d rather fall short of an <br/>
awesome speech than tell Laurie I&#39;m too busy to talk. (sorry <br/>
conference goers. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Finding your priorities is a very helpful thing. Will it matter five <br/>
years from now that you had uninterrupted computer time? No. Will it <br/>
matter five years from now that you welcomed her into your lap for <br/>
nourishment everytime she wanted it? Yes. <br/>
<br/>
I honestly can&#39;t think of a single thing that I put off and suffered <br/>
over so that I could nourish Laurie. Guess they weren&#39;t really that <br/>
important. :-) <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all about choices and letting your child know that she&#39;s number <br/>
one with you. It&#39;s the wisest choice I ever made.<br/>
<br/>
Now to the speech notes. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
I like this...and I totally believe it&#39;s true.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve told this a hundred times before, so those of you that have <br/>
read about this paradigm shift can just skip to the next message.:)<br/>
<br/>
My Mom fought cancer for many years.<br/>
At one point, I was staying in Alaska for 2-3 weeks extra, to care <br/>
for her. It was late at night, I was in the basement folding clothes <br/>
thinking about how tired I was and how I wished I didn&#39;t need to do <br/>
laundry right then. <br/>
I stopped myself right there and thought about many conversations <br/>
I&#39;d had at unschooling.com, and realized it was my choice to feel <br/>
this way. I looked at the  pile of laundry and realized how very, <br/>
very fortunate I really was.<br/>
Each and every piece of clothing was a symbol of a loved one, that <br/>
was still with me. I began to fold that laundry with a thankful <br/>
heart, hoping that I&#39;d have many more opportunities to fold my <br/>
mothers laundry.<br/>
I didn&#39;t.<br/>
She died two years ago and I&#39;d give anything to fold her laundry, <br/>
wash her hair and tell stories at night before bed (she was a <br/>
storyteller).<br/>
When I get frustrated today, I stop, and look around at the lovely <br/>
messes that represent my loved ones. They are with me...and I am <br/>
grateful.<br/>
The crumbs on the counter mean they are healthy and eating. The pile <br/>
of dirty dishes is a sign that we have enough food to eat, the dirty <br/>
laundry means we have nice clothing we enjoy and fun activities to <br/>
get it dirty with.:)<br/>
Everything in this entire life is about choices. There are always <br/>
situations and people we didn&#39;t choose, but how we respond is <br/>
totally about perspective and decisions.<br/>
I choose to be thankful today. I&#39;m glad that my toddler can still <br/>
nurse and recieve nourishment and comfort. I&#39;m glad that Sierra <br/>
wants me to stop typing and watch another cartwheel, it means she <br/>
still sees me as an important part of her life. I&#39;m glad Trevor is <br/>
bugging me to use the computer right now because it means he enjoys <br/>
researching his interests and learning new things. I&#39;m glad Jared is <br/>
asking me to make him Cream of Wheat for the millionth time in the <br/>
last two days, because it means I&#39;m buying a food he likes!:) And <br/>
heck, it&#39;s pretty easy as far as food requests go.<br/>
<br/>
Thankfulness is a choice. The proverbial glass is truly half full if <br/>
we just pause long enough to see all the good that is in our lives, <br/>
even in the hard times. <br/>
Toddlers grow up awfully fast, suck up every minute of sweet <br/>
interruptions, for those interruptions are actually the moments that <br/>
matter...not the thing we thought we wanted instead.<br/>

breath and live more mindfully.My husband is really struggling with this right <br/>
now, at work and home, and I think your post may give him some comfort as well. <br/>
I have read your story a few times, and each time I slow down a   bit more. <br/>
Another thing I find helpful with this is a book Sandra recommends on her <br/>
website. It is called &quot;The Zen Commandments&quot; and it has really helped me to see <br/>
things differently with my children.<br/>
Your post has come to me at  exactly the time I needed it, I am not <br/>
remembering to keep my children ahead of everything else, I keep trying to &quot;get things <br/>
done&quot; , or find a way to go ride the horse or walk the dog or something. <br/>
Thank you, thank you, thank you. Tho it was not aimed at me personally,  this <br/>
is the great effect this list can have on people&#39;s lives.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s funny, because I write very strongly sometimes; very <br/>
passionately about unschooling issues. What you may not realize <br/>
though, is I write it as much for myself as anyone at the list. <br/>
Everytime I sit and write a post, it&#39;s a powerful reminder to myself <br/>
to live what I preach. It works.<br/>
The more I talk about living this lifestyle, the easier it seems to <br/>
get. My old tapes are slowly being replaced with better messages.<br/>
<br/>
I truly think that&#39;s one of the greatest things about these <br/>
lists...it gives us a chance to dig really deep into what is <br/>
meaningful and remind ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
I feel truly grateful to Sandra, Joyce, Pam, Anne, Kelly and so many <br/>
others that gave me gentle and not-so-gentle nudges when I needed <br/>
them. I owe the universe...so I pay it back by writing and talking <br/>
and talking and writing and.....until everyone gets sick of hearing <br/>
it!! lol<br/>

Thank you so much for posting this. I am going to keep this to remind myself<br/>
of what is really important on a regular basis. I am sorry I am going to<br/>
miss your speech this week-end, I hope you are going to be speaking at next<br/>
years conference, because I am planning on being there even if I have to<br/>
drag dh kicking and screaming. I will entice him with beach time, a week or<br/>

I didn&#39;t see ______ as an acceptable interruption when Laurie needed <br/>
me to nourish her - spiritually, physically or otherwise. Fill in <br/>
the blank as you choose. Anything and everything will fit.<br/>
<br/>
When we see our children&#39;s needs as interruptions, they feel it. <br/>
She&#39;s learning that your computer time is more important to you than <br/>
nourishing her. Maybe mama milk isn&#39;t what she REALLY wants. Maybe <br/>
she needs to know that she is number one to you, right then, when <br/>
she needs to know it, no matter what you&#39;re doing. Being a child is <br/>
scary and removing all scariness is a time-consuming job for a <br/>
parent, but it&#39;s a job with more benefits than you can imagine - <br/>
benefits that will become obvious to you as she gets older.<br/>
<br/>
My Laurie is 24 now and recently moved away to pursue her PhD.   <br/>
Last night, I finally sat down at the computer to attempt to write <br/>
some notes to help me with my speech in Peabody this weekend. I <br/>
didn&#39;t intend on putting it off until the last minute, but it <br/>
couldn&#39;t be helped.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I had been typing for about a minute and a half (seriously) <br/>
and the phone rang. It was Laurie, bubbling over with news about her <br/>
first day in some of her classes. She started describing each <br/>
professor that she&#39;ll be working with, the classroom, etc. I reached <br/>
up and minimized what I had typed so I wouldn&#39;t be distracted from <br/>
her phone call. She babbled and shared and &quot;interrupted&quot; me for over <br/>
an hour. She told about her grocery shopping trip and how she found <br/>
organic apples at the Winn Dixie.<br/>
<br/>
Then she told me how much she loved me and how much it meant to her <br/>
that I always had time for her, in the past and now. She <br/>
said, &quot;Knowing you, you were right in the middle of something <br/>
important...but I&#39;ll never know about it, huh?&quot; I laughed and told <br/>
her that nothing was more important to me than hearing from her. <br/>
(I&#39;m SO grateful for cell phones) She said, &quot;Yeah, I am pretty <br/>
wonderful, huh?&quot;  Yeah, she is.<br/>
<br/>
Would you see that as an acceptable interruption since we&#39;re living <br/>
apart for the first time in 24 years and of course we&#39;re missing <br/>
each other! Would you still see it as acceptable if you knew it <br/>
happened every day? It does. <br/>
<br/>
I miss the times when she crawled onto my lap for nourishment, but <br/>
as far as I&#39;m concerned she&#39;s really still doing that, and there is <br/>
nothing that will ever be more important to me than giving her <br/>
nourishment. I figure that I was put on this earth to be Laurie&#39;s <br/>
mom and anything else is lagniappe (cajun french word for &#39;extra&#39;).<br/>
<br/>
If it means that I only have a few hours to throw together some <br/>
notes for my speech at the Live & Learn conference, then the parents <br/>
there will understand, realize and KNOW that my speech about Laurie <br/>
isn&#39;t as important as Laurie herself. I&#39;d rather fall short of an <br/>
awesome speech than tell Laurie I&#39;m too busy to talk. (sorry <br/>
conference goers. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Finding your priorities is a very helpful thing. Will it matter five <br/>
years from now that you had uninterrupted computer time? No. Will it <br/>
matter five years from now that you welcomed her into your lap for <br/>
nourishment everytime she wanted it? Yes. <br/>
<br/>
I honestly can&#39;t think of a single thing that I put off and suffered <br/>
over so that I could nourish Laurie. Guess they weren&#39;t really that <br/>
important. :-) <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all about choices and letting your child know that she&#39;s number <br/>
one with you. It&#39;s the wisest choice I ever made.<br/>
<br/>
Now to the speech notes. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
love, Valerie<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1962374789">WOW two fabulous posts in one day. Thank you Ren! What a great way to live<br/>
your life. I have been working on it for a couple of years now. I still can<br/>
get bogged down, but usually dig myself out and try to remember to just be<br/>
thankful for what I have instead of bitching about what is wrong with what I<br/>
have. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the reminder, something I really need going into the birth of<br/>
my second child and another huge life change as we all adjust to a new being<br/>
in our family,<br/>

&quot;If you change the way you look at things; the things you look at<br/>
will change. (Wayne Dyer)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I like this...and I totally believe it&#39;s true.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve told this a hundred times before, so those of you that have <br/>
read about this paradigm shift can just skip to the next message.:)<br/>
<br/>
My Mom fought cancer for many years.<br/>
At one point, I was staying in Alaska for 2-3 weeks extra, to care <br/>
for her. It was late at night, I was in the basement folding clothes <br/>
thinking about how tired I was and how I wished I didn&#39;t need to do <br/>
laundry right then. <br/>
I stopped myself right there and thought about many conversations <br/>
I&#39;d had at unschooling.com, and realized it was my choice to feel <br/>
this way. I looked at the  pile of laundry and realized how very, <br/>
very fortunate I really was.<br/>
Each and every piece of clothing was a symbol of a loved one, that <br/>
was still with me. I began to fold that laundry with a thankful <br/>
heart, hoping that I&#39;d have many more opportunities to fold my <br/>
mothers laundry.<br/>
I didn&#39;t.<br/>
She died two years ago and I&#39;d give anything to fold her laundry, <br/>
wash her hair and tell stories at night before bed (she was a <br/>
storyteller).<br/>
When I get frustrated today, I stop, and look around at the lovely <br/>
messes that represent my loved ones. They are with me...and I am <br/>
grateful.<br/>
The crumbs on the counter mean they are healthy and eating. The pile <br/>
of dirty dishes is a sign that we have enough food to eat, the dirty <br/>
laundry means we have nice clothing we enjoy and fun activities to <br/>
get it dirty with.:)<br/>
Everything in this entire life is about choices. There are always <br/>
situations and people we didn&#39;t choose, but how we respond is <br/>
totally about perspective and decisions.<br/>
I choose to be thankful today. I&#39;m glad that my toddler can still <br/>
nurse and recieve nourishment and comfort. I&#39;m glad that Sierra <br/>
wants me to stop typing and watch another cartwheel, it means she <br/>
still sees me as an important part of her life. I&#39;m glad Trevor is <br/>
bugging me to use the computer right now because it means he enjoys <br/>
researching his interests and learning new things. I&#39;m glad Jared is <br/>
asking me to make him Cream of Wheat for the millionth time in the <br/>
last two days, because it means I&#39;m buying a food he likes!:) And <br/>
heck, it&#39;s pretty easy as far as food requests go.<br/>
<br/>
Thankfulness is a choice. The proverbial glass is truly half full if <br/>
we just pause long enough to see all the good that is in our lives, <br/>
even in the hard times. <br/>
Toddlers grow up awfully fast, suck up every minute of sweet <br/>
interruptions, for those interruptions are actually the moments that <br/>
matter...not the thing we thought we wanted instead.<br/>
