<div id="ygrps-yiv-1410085913">Is anyone on these sites? & Which do you prefer? and why?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking I&#39;m preferring facebook because it&#39;s not so much stimulation overload.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;d like to add more unschoolers to my circles. I didn&#39;t realize what a big difference it made to me to be able to see peoples pictures and faces while talking to them. HUGE!<br/>
<br/>
Yay! Technology!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sagepixie on myspace and Amy Chester (my profile picture is me smelling a rose)(their are at least 7 Amy Chesters&#39;) on facebook if you want to add me.<br/>

<br/>
Mother, oh Mother,<br/>
come shake out your cloth,<br/>
empty the dustpan,<br/>
poison the moth,<br/>
hang out the washing<br/>
and butter the bread,<br/>
sew on a button and make up a bed.<br/>
<br/>
Where is the mother whose house<br/>
is so shocking?<br/>
She&#39;s up in the nursery,<br/>
blissfully rocking.<br/>
Oh, I&#39;ve grown shiftless as Little<br/>
Boy Blue (lullaby, rockaby, lullaby loo).<br/>
<br/>
Dishes are waiting and bills are past due<br/>
(pat-a-cake, darling, and peek, peekaboo).<br/>
The shopping&#39;s not done<br/>
and there&#39;s nothing for stew<br/>
and out in the yard there&#39;s a hullabaloo<br/>
but I&#39;m playing Kanga and this is my Roo.<br/>
Look! Aren&#39;t her eyes the most wonderful hue?<br/>
(lullaby, rockaby, lullaby loo).<br/>
<br/>
The cleaning and scrubbing<br/>
will wait till tomorrow,<br/>
for children grow up,<br/>
as I&#39;ve learned to my sorrow.<br/>
So quiet down, cobwebs.<br/>
Dust go to sleep.<br/>
I&#39;m rocking my baby and babies don&#39;t keep&#39;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1624304088">FWIW I find Myspace to be a bit like visiting a prostitute...you might not<br/>
catch anything but chances are pretty good that you will.  I got a NASTY<br/>
virus from Myspace.  But I&#39;m having lots of fun with Facebook.<br/>
I&#39;m sure others have had different experiences but that was my opinion.<br/>

<br/>
Allison - Wowzers! That kind of stuff always gives me the heebie geebies. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d go as far as to place the whole site into a box of bad. Stuff like that happens everywhere. It&#39;s kind of like finding a spider in your salad. We all know it happens, but we don&#39;t like to think about it and hope it doesn&#39;t happen to us.<br/>
<br/>
Katherine - I am totally impatient. Absolutely. I *did* sign up though and have participated because I want to give it a chance. It&#39;s just not grown to the level that I&quot;m not asking anyone to sign up for something new. I&#39;ve decided it was easier (for me) to just accept most people already have a facebook or myspace and go with it.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Mother, oh Mother,<br/>
<br/>
come shake out your cloth,<br/>
<br/>
empty the dustpan,<br/>
<br/>
poison the moth,<br/>
<br/>
hang out the washing<br/>
<br/>
and butter the bread,<br/>
<br/>
sew on a button and make up a bed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Where is the mother whose house<br/>
<br/>
is so shocking?<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s up in the nursery,<br/>
<br/>
blissfully rocking.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I&#39;ve grown shiftless as Little<br/>
<br/>
Boy Blue (lullaby, rockaby, lullaby loo).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dishes are waiting and bills are past due<br/>
<br/>
(pat-a-cake, darling, and peek, peekaboo).<br/>
<br/>
The shopping&#39;s not done<br/>
<br/>
and there&#39;s nothing for stew<br/>
<br/>
and out in the yard there&#39;s a hullabaloo<br/>
<br/>
but I&#39;m playing Kanga and this is my Roo.<br/>
<br/>
Look! Aren&#39;t her eyes the most wonderful hue?<br/>
<br/>
(lullaby, rockaby, lullaby loo).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The cleaning and scrubbing<br/>
<br/>
will wait till tomorrow,<br/>
<br/>
for children grow up,<br/>
<br/>
as I&#39;ve learned to my sorrow.<br/>
<br/>
So quiet down, cobwebs.<br/>
<br/>
Dust go to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m rocking my baby and babies don&#39;t keep&#39;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756034217">Right.  :)  If you want local people, you can do a little post letting<br/>
people on your local list know about familyrun.ning.com and then those who<br/>
are interested may join.  Sure.  That&#39;s the idea.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-650146647">Maybe that&#39;s so.  ??  You&#39;re the first and only person I&#39;ve heard from with<br/>
a profile not created by the supposed owner.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t make sense to me.  How would someone know your info enough to put<br/>
you on an unschooling network?<br/>

&gt;   A lot of those watermelon profiles may be fake ones. Having never<br/>
&gt; joined the site I discovered I had a fake profile on it - my email<br/>
&gt; address, and some correct facts, but not set up by me. I have some<br/>
&gt; concerns about this site.<br/>

&gt; &gt; One thing I would say about all those watermelons all over the<br/>
&gt; place and not<br/>
&gt; &gt; finding local people on there is... it&#39;s brand new. It&#39;s only been<br/>
&gt; up<br/>
&gt; &gt; *maybe* 2 months. I can look to find out the first welcome note<br/>
&gt; Laura put<br/>
&gt; &gt; up for the date. Over 500 people have joined in that small period<br/>
&gt; of time.<br/>
&gt; &gt; That&#39;s pretty tremendous.<br/>

&gt; &gt; The more people who join, the more likely one is to find local<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I have a profile there already and have commented on some of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; discussions. For me the issue is that I&#39;m not seeing the people I<br/>
&gt; see at<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; park days there, I&#39;m not seeing the people I know from meetup.com<br/>
&gt; and for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the most part I&#39;m not seeing profile pics of the actual people<br/>
&gt; just pictures<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of watermelons....<br/>
