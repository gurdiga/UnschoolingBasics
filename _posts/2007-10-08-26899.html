<div id="ygrps-yiv-1845313868">Actually, this is not true.  Tooth rot has more to do with a genetic roll of<br/>
the dice than care.   I am 36 yrs old and have on paper taken horrible care<br/>
of my teeth.  As a child I did not brush for MONTHS.  Even now, I do not<br/>
brush twice a day (mostly because I have mouth ulcers and at times it&#39;s too<br/>
painful to brush.)  I have NO cavities.  No rot, no periodontal disease.<br/>
Both my brothers take much better care of their teeth but they have tons of<br/>
fillings.  I really think it&#39;s just a matter of chance.  So as uptight as I<br/>
am about everything else still &lt;bg&gt; on tooth brushing I sort of leave it<br/>
alone.  I remind every now and again &quot;Hey, have you brushed your teeth<br/>
lately?&quot;  But I don&#39;t ever bug them about it.<br/>
<br/>
You can give other things a try...toothbrushes that make music, light up,<br/>
bubblegum toothpaste.  Offer different options perhaps.  Also gauze on a<br/>
finger tip works too.  Not as good as a brushing but better than nothing.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not going to comment at all on the &quot;shoulds&quot; or &quot;coulds&quot; really since<br/>
I&#39;m too new at this.  I just wanted to put your mind at ease about the rot.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-881132339">Absolutely. My grandmother used to say, &quot;You either got good spit or <br/>
bad spit.&quot; I brush my teeth after every meal. I even carry a <br/>
toothbrush and toothpaste in my purse and have been know to give <br/>
myself a quick brush in the car. Last year I had to have 4 root <br/>
canals and 3 cavities fixed! My husband usually brushes once a day, <br/>
sometimes twice and very seldom has any problems. I can only remember <br/>
him having one cavity in the last 10 years. <br/>
My dd was tremendously influenced by our last trip to the dentist. He <br/>
is very good with children and took the time to show her with a <br/>
plastic model how to brush most effectively. He talked to her on her <br/>
level and explained all about dental care. I have also been able to <br/>
find cute little books about dental care that my kids enjoyed. This <br/>
helped a great deal. Sometimes if we are going out I will ask them if <br/>
they remembered to brush and try to remind them before bed but other <br/>
than that I don&#39;t worry too much about it. My own experiences have <br/>
shown me that it doesn&#39;t make a whole lot of difference in how many <br/>
dental problems a person has. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1060042741">I do agree with you by the way.  I have one cavity and have not taken the best care of my teeth.  My father is the same way, and I&#39;m pretty sure genetically I got his teeth.  Both of my girls are adopted.  My 9 year old has the worst teeth ever.  I lost count a long time ago on the number of cavities she has.  We go to the dentist every six months and she has anywhere from 2-4 cavities every time, and she DOES brush her teeth.  Now my 7 year old is the one that does not brush her teeth.  She only has 1 cavity so far, but really I have no history on how her birth parents teeth were.  The kid is gonna need braces for sure.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I really just don&#39;t know if I should let it go,  remind her once and a while to brush her teeth or what.  I certainly don&#39;t want to be the big bully standing over her telling her she WILL brush her teeth.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1305619499">I don&#39;t know, my girls go in phases. I don&#39;t push it, but when we  <br/>
visit the dentist, they love our hygienist and if she says that it  <br/>
looks like their teeth look uncared for, they want to keep them clean  <br/>
for her. With the boys it&#39;s such a part of their nightly routine,  <br/>
that they just expect it. I imagine at some point they&#39;ll say &quot;not  <br/>
now&quot; and run off.<br/>
One thing I did do was buy the ACT floride treatment, which they do  <br/>
like to use, and I feel like at least they are strengthening their  <br/>
teeth even if they don&#39;t brush as well. Eating apples and cheese is  <br/>
supposed to be good, as well as a glass of water after meals. We also  <br/>
play dentist sometimes, where we take turns brushing teeth. I&#39;ll just  <br/>
say that it&#39;s been a while and ask if they want to play dentist.   <br/>
We&#39;ve also experimented a lot with brushes and  pastes. For while,  <br/>
Breanna would let us use a washcloth to clean her teeth, it works as  <br/>
well without all the overwhelming sensory issues of the hundred  <br/>
bristles and toothpaste flavor.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1962799512">Where would one find ph strips for the mouth and how does one read them?<br/>
That sounds really interesting to me. I don&#39;t know if my kids would be into<br/>
it but I want to try that out.<br/>
<br/>
I tend to let tooth brushing go. We have a chart that we put a mark on if we<br/>
remember to brush our teeth (including mama and papa) this is not a reward<br/>
thing, just a reminder chart. The kids (and us) can see if we have brushed<br/>
our teeth at least once per day. This really helps me because I have a hard<br/>
time remembering things.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually, yes, some folks can and do exactly that.<br/>
<br/>
For us, DS would sometimes comment on my (or DH&#39;s) &quot;morning breath&quot; <br/>
by saying our breath was &quot;hot&quot; and we&#39;d go brush. So, when his <br/>
breath gets &quot;hot&quot;, I&#39;ll mention it and ask if he wants help or wants <br/>
to do it himself (he&#39;s 9). I think that&#39;s another big area of the <br/>
situation too - just because a child is 6 or 7 or 8 or whatever <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean they &quot;have to&quot; brush on their own by themselves in the <br/>
bathroom. Sometimes we&#39;ve had three tiered brushing action with DS, <br/>
then me looking over him into the mirror and DH looking over my head <br/>
(which usually occasions lots of silliness BTW). Often, DS will <br/>
request I do the brushing for him, so I do. Sometimes we&#39;ll take the <br/>
toothbrush, a small cup of water to rinse and another cup to spit <br/>
into (and a small washcloth) into the other room and brushing occurs <br/>
while watching TV. Sometimes brushing doesn&#39;t occur before bed and <br/>
after breakfast but at other times of the day when there&#39;s a <br/>
convenient &#39;pause&#39; in the activity level of the day and that&#39;s cool <br/>
too.<br/>

We have the hairbrushing thing here with Julian (he&#39;s 5, has long hair, I  <br/>
have some ideas if you want them - mainly LOTS of this GREAT conditioner I found <br/>
 that costs an arm and a leg, lol, and some other things to help him cope). <br/>
The  teeth, he has no issues with buuuut....Ideas, perhaps?<br/>
 <br/>
Electric toothbrush that she can use in any room at any time? <br/>
 <br/>
A different flavored toothpaste? Or none?<br/>
 <br/>
Half and half? Uppers at one time, lowers at another? <br/>
 <br/>
Use of a timer so she can see that time passes quickly? (or would that make  <br/>
it seem like forever to her?)<br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s tough...I&#39;ll look for more answers myself! <br/>

Does she have cavities or are you more &quot;afraid&quot; that her teeth will rot out<br/>
of her mouth?<br/>
<br/>
There are things you can do besides actually brushing teeth:  use Dr. Ray&#39;s<br/>
Spiffies wipes (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.drraysproducts.com/)">http://www.drraysproducts.com/)</a>.  These are individually<br/>
foil-wrapped wet wipes for teeth that have xylitol in them.  My younger ones<br/>
chew them like gum and then spit them out; she could wrap one around her<br/>
finger or chew it.  The great thing about these is you can carry them around<br/>
with you - she can clean her teet whenever she gets the urge.<br/>
<br/>
She can also rinse her mouth with a baking soda or xylitol wash, instead of<br/>
brushing.  Some foods, such as cheese, are good for teeth.  She can chew<br/>
xylitol gum or eat xylitol mints (www.xylitolnow.com,<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://homesteadmarket.com/about.html,">http://homesteadmarket.com/about.html,</a> or www.xlear.com have good products).<br/>
<br/>
You asked how we handle it:  half of our family (my sons and I) have the<br/>
strep mutans bacteria that causes early childhood caries (ECC).  Early<br/>
Childhood Caries (ECC) is the most infectious disease among children younger<br/>
than five and is usually transmitted by a parent or caregiver (by biting a<br/>
piece of food and giving it to the child).  My sons both had partial bridges<br/>
by the time they were two.  By the time my youngest was two, he had 6 teeth<br/>
pulled and had two lower molar crowns.  I could visibly see the teeth<br/>
dissolving over a two week period and could see a HOLE through one of his<br/>
molars.  I brush, floss, and still was going in for a cavity repair every<br/>
month or two, and have 4 root canals and a couple additional crowns.<br/>
<br/>
One of the changes we made was to brush before instead of after eating.  The<br/>
bacteria must come in contact with sugar or carbohydrates to acidify; even<br/>
brushing immediately after eating allows the bacteria to acidify.  By<br/>
brushing before eating one removes the bacterial plaque, which takes<br/>
twenty-four hours to recolonize. We also eat foods to remineralize our teeth<br/>
and take cod liver oil, and use xylitol toothpaste and products.<br/>
<br/>
My youngest has not had a single cavity in two years.  One eye tooth that<br/>
had begun calcifying when we made our changes - has not progressed AT ALL<br/>
into any decay (I have an explorer and check for sticky spots).<br/>
<br/>
We do not have any resistance to tooth brushing, is just part of our routine<br/>
like washing hands after using the bathroom.  We keep toothbrushes in the<br/>
kitchen, the bathroom, and the car, for convenience (there is no adult<br/>
looming over them - sometimes we feel our teeth are fuzzy and are too busy<br/>
to go to the bathroom to brush them - kitchen is then more handy).  My boys<br/>
would much rather brush their teeth than have emergency extractions for<br/>
teeth that have broken off at the gumline (this happened to my youngest and<br/>
was probably the most agonizing parenting moment I have ever gone through;<br/>
with the other son his top four teeth broke in half after a fall onto<br/>
carpet).  For my boys, they lay on the bed at night and &quot;mommy robot&quot; brings<br/>
the robot brush - or they are frozen and the tooth brush unfreezes them -<br/>
whatever game they invent, I will do.<br/>
<br/>
As you can see there are numerous alternatives to actually brushing, I hope<br/>
one of these works for you and your daughter.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-618378206">~~You can give other things a try...toothbrushes that make music,<br/>
light up, bubblegum toothpaste.  Offer different options perhaps. <br/>
Also gauze on a finger tip works too.  Not as good as a brushing but<br/>
better than nothing.~~<br/>
<br/>
Well dang Karen! You sound like a bonafide radical.;)<br/>
<br/>
I agree with you about the genetic factor. My youngest has some <br/>
sensory issues and doesn&#39;t like brushing very often. He also has teeth<br/>
that aren&#39;t especially healthy. We found this mouthwash that has<br/>
xylitol and no alcohol, so he loves it. We also keep baking soda<br/>
around.....<br/>
<br/>
His adult teeth have just started coming in so hopefully those will do<br/>
better than his baby teeth have.  With all that breastfeeding he got,<br/>
you&#39;d think it would help.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-760766971">Well my kid is freakishly strong.  She would probably beat the crap out of me if I tried to pin her down to brush her teeth, LOL!!!  <br/>
   <br/>
  OK, all kidding aside........NO, I am not going to hold her down.  <br/>
   <br/>
  As part of starting an Unschooling Life (and I do have a way to go) I decided to give up a lot of the &quot;daily&quot; battles.  For instance over the weekend the house really needed to be cleaned, and I really needed help.  Nobody would help.  My old self would have been screaming at the kids to clean up their rooms, etc.  My youngest said to me, I am really tired and I don&#39;t want to help, which once again could have turned into me screaming.  NOPE, I said ok, the kids went outside to play.  I did what I could.  Mostly the house did not get clean, but the earth did not fall off it&#39;s axis because the house did not get cleaned.  Life is just too short for me to be screaming and freaking out over things like that.  Anyway I guess my point is I&#39;m not gonna freak out over the teeth either, and holding her down is not an option.<br/>

Yes, I realize that some people will forcibly hold a child down to <br/>
brush teeth. I find it incomprehensible myself. I figured that most <br/>
on this list would agree that it *can&#39;t* (literally yes, but you get <br/>
the drift) be done. It is just not an option.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2139955806">LOL, Mariah (7) has her hair cut real short, so even if it is not combed for days it can easily be taken care of.  Now Lexi (9) has long hair, and it has not been combed in days, and it&#39;s starting to look like dread locks.........and I have no problem with dread locks for those of you who have them.  I asked her (gently) to brush it today, and she looked at me and said NO.  And I did not make a big deal out of it.  I figure we will come up with a solution to nobody wanting to comb their hair at some point.  Lexi does use conditioner when she showers, so that does help.  I though maybe I would offer to put some braids in Lexi&#39;s hair or something like that, and then well as part of that I would have to brush her hair.  <br/>

My 7 year old HATES brushing her teeth. Well she hates to have her <br/>
hair combed too. The hair thing.....well who cares, it can be one big <br/>
messy knot and it&#39;s of no consequence. The teeth.....well they are <br/>
gonna rot out of her mouth. She does not want me to do it, and she <br/>
refuses to do it herself. So I have let it go for a period of time <br/>
thinking it would start to bother her......NOPE, she has fur growing <br/>
on those babies and she could care less. I&#39;m just not sure how to <br/>
approach this one.<br/>
