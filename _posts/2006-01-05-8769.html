Recently I annoyed someone (stranger at a kid&#39;s birthday party) whose<br/>
first<br/>
question on hearing that we homeschool was &quot;How do you get her to<br/>
listen to<br/>
you?&quot; by instantly replying &quot;I try to say something worth listening to.&quot;&quot;<br/>

I LOVE it!!! What a great response. I&#39;m jealous of such wit.:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1952569537">&quot;In terms of stamps she is far<br/>
more likely to be interested in the kind of stamp that is self inking,&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I like that idea.<br/>
I bought a self-inking stamp for ME and Jalen has been covering his<br/>
body with it. It&#39;s not even a nice design or anything, it&#39;s my name,<br/>
email addy and phone number!! But the self-inking aspect has him<br/>
fascinated.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe order some self-inking stamps with their names and let them go<br/>
to town on their bodies! That&#39;d be fun.<br/>

I have to confess that I surprised myself (in hindsight) by saying it. It<br/>
was one of those moments when we seem to be speaking without conscious<br/>
thought and it was good instead of awful - like being a momentary conduit<br/>
from the divine. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry to say that I rarely can do it on demand. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s kinda cool to be sitting here across the continent, when I should be<br/>
sleeping btw, knowing that you are there reading what I just now posted,<br/>
right at this moment. A kind of connectedness.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-683033611">Wow! I first just want to say that I am in awe that people that don&#39;t even <br/>
know me would take the time to respond so quickly in such a thoughtful, <br/>
caring way.<br/>
I literally sat in tears as I read your words. Yes, I grew up in a very <br/>
controlled environment. I am sure I was told constantly how to do <br/>
something or not to do something at all. I remember some of it, but I have <br/>
forgotten a lot too. When I read the line about the, &quot;little girl inside <br/>
that is scared and just trying to hold her world together&quot; I broke down, <br/>
though the tears were already flowing. I want to explore that some more.<br/>
<br/>
I gained something from every email.Pam, I loved the idea of a couple of <br/>
activities for every day and what to expect. I&#39;ll take as many of them as <br/>
you can give. I&#39;ll put instant pudding on my grocery list. It will be a <br/>
real test for me, I&#39;m sure, but I think it&#39;s a good starting place - in <br/>
the bathtub.<br/>
<br/>
It helped me a great deal to simply hear that others of you deal with a <br/>
controlling nature in yourselves and that there is hope. I also appreciate <br/>
giving me &#39;permission&#39; to do less challenging activities and to stay out <br/>
of their way when they are doing something that might tempt me to take <br/>
over, or even to just sit and watch videos with them without feeling like <br/>
we should do more. <br/>
<br/>
Practically, thank you for the tips about cleaning stamps and buying extra <br/>
stamp pads that I don&#39;t protect. Great ideas. I know 3 and 5 sound young, <br/>
and they are, but they love this kind of stuff. People always think my <br/>
younger daughter is older than she is. When she was in Montessori she was <br/>
the youngest in the class.  During a parent-teacher conference I reminded <br/>
the teacher of that and she had a hard time believing it, until she <br/>
checked the list. I&#39;m not saying this to say that I should treat them as <br/>
if they are older than they are but just to explain why we often end up in <br/>
somewhat advanced activities. Still, even so, Iike the idea of clearly <br/>
thinking through ahead of time how things might go and how they might <br/>
respond to something as a 3 1/2 and a 5 year old.<br/>
<br/>
Well, they are needing me now so I must stop, but I can&#39;t thank you enough <br/>
for your responses. My husband read them all too and was touched. I think <br/>
he is realizing why these lists mean as much as they do to me.<br/>
I&#39;m going to print out this thread and keep it in my journal.<br/>
<br/>
What special women you are!<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
Gayle<br/>
<br/>
P.s. I didn&#39;t get to re-read this so forgive any errors.<br/>
