<div id="ygrps-yiv-1763234319">&quot;Has anyone&#39;s children played with Math-U-See? I think mostly my son likes<br/>
the manipulatives and the song. but I find myself asking is it too<br/>
schooly?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Only if you&#39;re putting it out as something more desirable than<br/>
anything else he is doing, or pushing it as a way to learn math.  If<br/>
it&#39;s just there, like any other thing in your home and he enjoys it,<br/>
then great.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2052762788">&quot;I thought about pick up the curriculum - more for myself then my son -<br/>
because he is very mathematically inclined and I am not very good at<br/>
math.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It costs way too much for that. I bought the whole thing back when we<br/>
were more &quot;relaxed/eclectic&quot; and thought it was great. But it&#39;s<br/>
really, really repetative, unecessarily so.  The manipulatives are<br/>
great fun (my kids also think they&#39;re building blocks) or for<br/>
explaining place value in a simple way. For the money, you can get<br/>
lots of other cool stuff that will help you get over your math anxiety.<br/>
<br/>
Books that helped me;<br/>
&quot;I Hate Mathematics&quot; and &quot;Miracle Math&quot; were huge help. I also have<br/>
&quot;Algebra Unplugged&quot; and one by Theoni Pappas (can&#39;t remember the title<br/>
and it&#39;s still packed...Pam?) I think it&#39;s &quot;The Joy of Math&quot; or something.<br/>
An interesting read is &quot;The Math Instinct&quot;, but save your money. It<br/>
only confirms scientifically, everything unschoolers will tell you;<br/>
that math used for real life purposes comes naturally to humans, put<br/>
it on paper (symbolic) and it becomes troublesome.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1565827173">&quot;Family Math&quot; - great if you use it as fun games, not &quot;lessons.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Math for Smarty Pants,&quot; Marilyn Burns (also &quot;The I Hate Mathematics  <br/>

<br/>
For little kids - Peggy Kaye&#39;s book, &quot;Games for Math&quot; and &quot;Games for  <br/>

<br/>
I like ANYTHING by Theoni Pappas - but my kids - not so much.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1403019455">I recommend anything by Marilyn Burns.  She helps keep me out of the need to think that i need to be &quot;doing&quot; anything about &quot;math.&quot;  Was good to quote to dh when he worried about what we were or weren&#39;t &quot;doing.&quot;<br/>
