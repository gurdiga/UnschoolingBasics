My DS,  10, has only been out of PS for 2 weeks. I am pleased having<br/>
him home and  he seems very happy. I think that I had this vision of<br/>
him taking on  projects, reading on his own, exploring things, etc. and<br/>
it&#39;s just not  happening. Am I expecting too much, too soon? All he&#39;s<br/>
doing right now is  riding his dirt bike, playing playstation, watching<br/>
TV, and playing  basketball and baseball. Reassure me that it&#39;s all<br/>
going to be OK.  <br/>

***************************<br/>
Betsy, I can totally relate to your fears.  I am slowly becoming more comfortable/confident in our own deschooling experience.  I took my 15 year old (sophomore by school measurments) ds out of public school 7 weeks ago.  Since that time, the deschooling *he* has chosen isn&#39;t what *I* planned but I can&#39;t say I am surprised.  He gets up around 1 p.m., showers, sometimes eats...sometimes doesn&#39;t, his friends get out of school at 2:30 and he hangs with them until 6 or 7 p.m. when they all go home for dinner and homework.  He goes upstairs to his room, plays Playstation and watches TV until 1 or 2 a.m. and repeats.  <br/>
<br/>
He has been in school most of his life since I was a single mom until he was 7, he began daycare (in a woman&#39;s home with only my son and her son) at 12 weeks.  He stayed with her until 2 years old at which time she moved out of state and he began KinderCare. He has been in the &quot;system&quot; until 7 weeks ago.  So by the &quot;deschooling time-line&quot; (referenced as 1 month for every year in school) he would need 14 months or more.  School *work* was not something he enjoyed or even did.  He went solely for the social aspect.  Loves his friends, playing on the school soccer team, meeting girls... &lt;g&gt;...but rarely did the &quot;work&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
Like others here have stated, reading all the wonderful post from those living unschooling gives me hope and calms my fears ...unfortunately only temporarily.  (This is why I read EVERY post!)  I realize *I* have SO much deschooling to do and finding it challenging in many ways.  First, I am a type A personality and obviously been conditioned by my parents and school and career choice to be very goal/achievement driven. This is my &quot;gremlin&quot; that I have to tame.  I just wish there was a magic wand one of you could wave over my head and ...poof... my fears and old beliefs would disappear.  In addition, my husband (ds&#39;s stepfather) is NOT really on the same page as I am and not really willing to learn about it - yet...  I invited him to come to the NE Unschooling Conference but he hasn&#39;t given me an answer yet.  I believe this could do all of us a great deal of good.  He is also extremely type A.  He is in sales (we all know how UN-unschooling that field is!!) and he believes that college degrees are mandatory to survive in the lifestyle we currently have.  We both have a hard time living in the now and tend to make choices based on how it may affect the future...How do I let me husband know that IF DS chooses to strive for having &quot;things&quot; in life that we should trust him to figure out how to acquire them?  DH thinks that if we don&#39;t require DS to go thru the system we are setting him up for failure.  However DS was getting poor grades so the system and their rules/requirements wouldn&#39;t have worked for him anyway.  Anyone else working on her DH?  Any good insight to share?  Links to Sandra&#39;s page I could print and ask him to read?  <br/>
<br/>
On a more positive note and back to ds and our new journey... I am anxious to spend time *with* him.  Learning about him.  Healing old wounds, gaining trust in our relationship, loving him where he is right now.  Many of my acquaintances in the schooling world say things like...&quot;Oh, a teenager, don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll like  each other again when he&#39;s 25 or so.&quot;  Like it&#39;s normal and the age he is we aren&#39;t *supposed* to like each other.  Well, I am not willing to lose 10 years!!!  So at the advice of all you gentle parents, I asked Justin (DS) if I could learn to play Playstation with him on Wednesday night.  (We had just gotten home from a Sixers basketball game that he and I attended together).  He taught me and we played for about 15-20 minutes.  It was midnight and I was just too tired to continue.  So last night, he asked if I wanted to play!  It was almost midnight again and I just couldn&#39;t force myself to do it.  So...with just this one experience, I am getting my wish!<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to when he wakes up today and seeing if he can fit a quick game in with MOM!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for this wonderful group!<br/>

Health and laughter,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hey Faith, (I do have a private post to send you that I keep forgetting<br/>
about! LOL!)<br/>
<br/>
I live with my children&#39;s father and at first it took him some time to get<br/>
used to the idea of unschooling.  His concern was more from a legal aspect.<br/>
What if &quot;someone&quot; found out we weren&#39;t teaching calculus and reading the<br/>
classics?  I had to point out to him all the things that HE hated about<br/>
school.  The required things that were a waste of his time.  I had to<br/>
pointout to him that he really was an unschooler at heart.  He has no degree<br/>
yet is working in a field where most people do have degrees.  He&#39;s making a<br/>
lovely salary and he loves what he does.  (Although the hours suck during<br/>
hurricane season!)<br/>
<br/>
Did you dh go to school to go into sales?  Does the education that he got<br/>
truly assist him in the field that he is in?  Or was it the piece of paper<br/>
that got him past the &quot;must have a Bachelor&#39;s degree&quot; requirement on job<br/>
searches?  I&#39;m seeing a gradual shift in the job market to experience over<br/>
degree.  I don&#39;t know if it is going to be an even point anytime soon, but<br/>
so many jobs these days start by reteaching employees how to do their jobs.<br/>
Nothing they learned at college applies to what they are actually doing.<br/>
Most companies use degree requirements to weed out their candidate field.<br/>
Weird!  They could be missing out on an opportunity of hiring someone like<br/>
my co-parent!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad to see that you are wanting to spend time with your son.  Isn&#39;t<br/>
that just so much fun?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2101071688">-ok first we ar still deschooling(all of us) and it has not been all fun, my 8 yr old has had a <br/>
hard time &quot;i feel lazy&quot; then we come up with something that seems fun, and the next day <br/>
she wants nothing to do with it. I let it go, then another day of &#39;i feel lazy&quot; another half <br/>
finished project.  But we are actually getting along better now than we were when she was <br/>
in school.  She was more the &quot;typical teen&quot; at age 7.  She is learning(teaching herself) to let <br/>
go, to relax, and it is not easy for her.  Or me.  We are getting there, but a lot of helaing <br/>
from school(her and I), she thinks she is stupid, or she should be doing this or that.  And <br/>
then we have these wonderful days where we explore, and learn with out even thinking &quot;oh <br/>
we are learning&quot;.  I started a journal when we left school, and it is full of things she does, a <br/>
lot. and some days &quot;nothing&quot;.  The unschooling way of life is what we want, and we are on <br/>
our way, but it is not easy, it is exciting and fun at times, but stressful to let go of the old <br/>
stuff.<br/>
 Everyone here has been wonderful, and thanks to you all.  I love reading the posts.  <br/>
