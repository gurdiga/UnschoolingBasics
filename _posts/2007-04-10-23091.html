<div id="ygrps-yiv-554798001">Hey there,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Rob, and I&#39;ve been a lapsed lurker for a good while now. <br/>
We have two girls, ages 5 and just turned 4 (16 months apart).  <br/>
<br/>
Our older daughter, Genevieve, has decided that she wants to go to<br/>
school.  She started this a year ago, and for a while, her Sunday<br/>
School class seemed to address that.  But now she is bringing it back<br/>
up again.  I think my wife Seana has put it better than I could, so<br/>
here is her post to another group.  Sorry for any duplicates.  And<br/>
thank you for your time and thoughts on this.<br/>
<br/>
Note:  Seana&#39;s mom is *mostly* supportive of our unschooling the<br/>
girls.  She&#39;s not antagonistic, and she does not try to subvert us,<br/>
either.<br/>

Daddy to Elissa (Now 4!)<br/>
<br/>
***************<br/>
<br/>
Genevieve has recently started talking, again, about going to &quot;real<br/>
school&quot;.  She told my mom that she wants to learn exciting things.   <br/>
I know she is bored but when I try to initiate something, she&#39;s not<br/>
interested.  I&#39;m not very happy about the idea of putting her in<br/>
public, all day, kindergarten and we can&#39;t afford private.  I feel<br/>
like I&#39;m failing her.  Elissa demands so much of me that I just don&#39;t<br/>
have much for Genevieve.  I try to help her see things and I know that<br/>
she isn&#39;t aware of how much she is learning/knows compared to<br/>
&#39;schooled&#39; kids but it is so hard when everyone is pushing &quot;how fun<br/>
school is.&quot;<br/>
HELP!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-672697136">Hi Rob<br/>
<br/>
One thing that was really helpful for us was being part of a <br/>
homeschool group (an inclusive, relaxed, eclectic bunch for the most <br/>
part) from the time DS was around 3 yrs old - at first it was mostly <br/>
just the occasional park day and such and then other activities like <br/>
trips to the zoo or the fire station or what-have-you. Bottom line <br/>
was that by the time he was &quot;school age&quot; he already knew a bunch of <br/>
kids, his age, older, younger, that all homeschooled. It wasn&#39;t an <br/>
unusual thing at all, like &quot;everyone else is going&quot; - he knew that <br/>
kids went to school (a bus stops at the house across the street) but <br/>
he also knew that there were bunches of kids that didn&#39;t. <br/>
Interestingly enough, he got the *opposite* opinion from those kid <br/>
shows - he decided that school took up too much time and he didn&#39;t <br/>
want to give up stuff he was already doing (sleeping late, eating <br/>
when he wanted to, playing games and watching TV and going places) <br/>
for the dubious &quot;excitement&quot; of school. It helped having experiences <br/>
like spending a day at the park and getting behind a school bus full <br/>
of kids who had been in school all day. Didn&#39;t take a whole lot for <br/>
him to notice the difference between his running and playing day and <br/>
their sit still and quiet day.<br/>
<br/>
Have you talked about what specifically it is that she is wanting <br/>
from school? Much of the kid stuff on TV and in books and movies is <br/>
about how cool it is at school - playing at recess and so on. Few <br/>
show the flip side - sitting at a desk, tests, waiting for meals, <br/>
bathroom breaks, play time, etc. (FWIW if you can find Recess and <br/>
The Weekenders it might help a tiny bit - both of those shows <br/>
basically say that there&#39;s school and then there&#39;s exciting LIFE and <br/>
you have to survive through school to get to life, at recess, after <br/>
school, on weekends and holidays). Maybe riding the bus and doing <br/>
craft projects are the big things. Okay, so figure out how to bring <br/>
that into her life - it might mean that you do crafts with her in <br/>
the evenings if Mom is struggling to handle both girls&#39; needs during <br/>
the day. Since I&#39;m at work fulltime, DS (he&#39;s almost 9, never been <br/>
schooled) and I have biweekly date nights together (the alternate <br/>
weeks, DS visits with MIL and DH and I have date nights). His choice <br/>
of what we do - sometimes it&#39;s Starbucks (his favorite spot), <br/>
sometimes it&#39;s dinner at a fav restaurant, sometimes he requests to <br/>
stay home and play a board game with just me or we go and watch a <br/>
DVD together, just us snuggled up. Perhaps setting up a &quot;Craft <br/>
night&quot; or, as DS suggested this weekend, a &quot;Science experiment&quot; <br/>
night or whatever - whatever will fill what she is expecting school <br/>
to fulfill - might help.<br/>
<br/>
And, again, she might choose school anyhow. Might read Guerilla <br/>
Learning by Grace Llewellyn. Even though she&#39;s in school, your <br/>
attitudes don&#39;t necessarily need to accept the &quot;line&quot; that schools <br/>
hand out about grades and test scores and such.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My dd wanted to go school last September.  The media is a propaganda<br/>
mill for how much &quot;fun&quot; school is!   The kids are bombarded with it<br/>
and it is hard to combat that as a parent. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I talked talked talked to my dd about school but let her know<br/>
that I supported her and that it was her choice. We tried to meet her<br/>
needs in other ways but she chose to go to school anyway. So off she<br/>
went, all excited about learning and making friends and having &quot;FUN&quot;.<br/>
 She would come home with a headache or a stomach ache and say &quot;I am<br/>
not going to tomorrow.&quot;  So she wouldn&#39;t go the next day.  Then she<br/>
would think, &quot;maybe it is fun?  I&#39;ll go tomorrow!&quot;.  So she alternated<br/>
days for the first 3 weeks.  I finally told her that she needed to<br/>
make a choice to either go every day or stop going all together<br/>
because I was going to get in trouble if she didn&#39;t start going more<br/>
often.  So she opted out. <br/>
<br/>
She really was able to see for herself how awful it was.  She thought<br/>
it was boring and she hated having to ask to go to the bathroom (and<br/>
once a teacher told her no).  She hated the &quot;time-out&quot; chair and how<br/>
she had to sit in just a certain way when the teacher was reading a<br/>
story.  She hated that she couldn&#39;t write the letters in her name the<br/>
way she had always done it (it wasn&#39;t the &quot;kindergarten way&quot;) She<br/>
could hardly think of anything positive to say about it!  And she<br/>
really tried to make it work but the fact of the matter is that school<br/>
sucks!  One night, while she was still attending, we were snuggling in<br/>
bed and talking about it and she started crying and said, &quot;It&#39;s all<br/>
lies!  They said it would be fun and that I would learn things but it<br/>
is all lies!&quot;  I just held her closed and grieved with her over her<br/>
loss of a dream.<br/>
<br/>
What this all taught me is that school really does suck.  And if you<br/>
continue to live in a radical unschooling way at home and don&#39;t let<br/>
yourself get sucked into the &quot;school mentality&quot;, your child (if she<br/>
goes) will see through the lies.  Who wouldn&#39;t?  The contrast is too<br/>
striking.  Keep your life at home fun and full of joy.  Explore the<br/>
world together.  Be their partner.  If she does end up going, do not<br/>
stop living the RU life because now you have one kid &quot;in school&quot;.  Do<br/>
not let school have that kind of power over you or your family.<br/>
<br/>
We fear that our children will become brainwashed, like all the other<br/>
kids, but I think that can happen only if the parents are also in on<br/>
the brainwashing.  If you maintain a radical unschooling lifestyle at<br/>
home, the kid will see through the brainwashing that the school is<br/>
trying to do to them.  Our kids are too strong of individuals, too<br/>
aware of their ability to make choices, too empowered.  They won&#39;t let<br/>
school strip them of that.  Kids that are already stripped of power<br/>
have nothing to lose in school and possibly might gain some power<br/>
there.  RU kids have their very identities to lose. I am guessing that<br/>
all RU kids would figure out that school sucks pretty fast.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that takes the fear out of it anyway and maybe helps a little!<br/>
 I just want to clarify that I am not saying &quot;send her to school - no<br/>
problem&quot;.  What I am saying is that, if after exhausting all other<br/>
possibilities, your daughter still wants to go to school, continue to<br/>
live like RU&#39;ers.  She will get out of school as soon as the negatives<br/>
outweigh the positives  which will probably be pretty quick.  I would<br/>
call the school district and find out how many days she can be absent<br/>
before you get in trouble, just so you know.  And have your intent to<br/>
homeschool (or whatever it is you need in your state) ready to go so<br/>
you can send it to them and get her out immediately when she says she<br/>
has had enough.<br/>
