me on a very deep level.<br/>
She&#39;s ALWAYS had traits that concern you? A child is born perfect and<br/>
whole in my opinion, so how early did these traits begin bothering you?<br/>
<br/>
I think a big shift in how you view her and her personality traits<br/>
might really help her see herself differently. We are the very first<br/>
reflection our child sees of themselves.<br/>
What are you reflecting back to a child that you&#39;ve always seen as<br/>
flawed?  What is she really great at? What does she hear coming from<br/>
her own parents?<br/>
If our reflection to our child is annoyance and frustration, that<br/>
plays a huge role in how they see themselves.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-938611343">After I reread my post, I realize how difficult it is to relay to  <br/>
anyone what our family life is like. I posted one negative thing, and  <br/>
in the heat of the moment, really focused on that. I would like to  <br/>
verify that we do not see her as flawed, and we are not constantly  <br/>
annoyed or frustrated by her. She has a lot of great traits, and I  <br/>
know she is a good person. We don&#39;t focus on the stealing, and she  <br/>
doesn&#39;t get punished, lectured, etc. I can&#39;t even imagine that  <br/>
subconsciously we&#39;re treating her differently, because I&#39;ve always  <br/>
assumed it was a developmental stage and that she&#39;d work through it.  <br/>
It is frustrating to me because I am not sure what to say or do to  <br/>
help her or her siblings deal with the emotions that come along with  <br/>
the actions.<br/>
<br/>
When I say that she&#39;s always had traits that concern me, I mean to  <br/>
say that I worry that her personality will not allow her to be all or  <br/>
do all of which she is capable. She has always been competitive,  <br/>
which is funny because no one else in our family (immediate or  <br/>
extended) really is. My MIL was, but she died not much after Emily  <br/>
was born, so dh and I laugh with each other about how much she is  <br/>
like his mom. It is odd though, because she is 18 months younger than  <br/>
her next older sibling, and it&#39;s always been a competition for her to  <br/>
catch up and get ahead of Breanna. It started with walking, talking,  <br/>
learning how to do anything. If she is not certain that she will be  <br/>
better than anyone else she knows, she will not attempt to do or  <br/>
learn something. That has concerned me, not because I think it&#39;s a  <br/>
negative trait, but because I worry about her burning out early. She  <br/>
doesn&#39;t have fun winning, but she is extremely driven to win. The  <br/>
stealing and lying, cheating concern me as well, because at this  <br/>
point, her friends and siblings don&#39;t want to play with her, and no  <br/>
one trusts her. When ever money is missing, her siblings immediately  <br/>
blame her. Because her sister is really really great at drawing  <br/>
lifelike things, Emily will do absolutely nothing with crayon and  <br/>
paper. When Rachel figured out on her own how to write in cursive,  <br/>
Emily was furious and mean to the family for days over that.<br/>
<br/>
In my op, I asked for help for ME to deal. Not to try and change her,  <br/>
but to try to understand her and what I can do to help. I needed to  <br/>
know if there was anything I should be doing with her, or what. I  <br/>
never said she was flawed, I said she had traits that concern me. I  <br/>
can&#39;t stand the cheating and stealing anymore, so I am obviously  <br/>
needing help for MYSELF. I need help for her siblings, because they  <br/>
are about to kill her. And I need ideas for how to approach her,  <br/>
because obviously I&#39;m not doing a good job. It&#39;s a big step for me  <br/>
just to admit I need help...and I thank everyone who has replied with  <br/>
insight and ideas.<br/>
