<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;A few months ago, Laurie heard from her grad school advisor <br/>
 </span></blockquote>after she sent in her registration. Along with her registration, she <br/>
had to send in letters of recommendation from three previous <br/>
professors. We don&#39;t know what the professors said in their letters, <br/>
but the advisor called and practically begged Laurie to attend <br/>
school there. He then got together with whomever and they created a <br/>
graduate assistantship for Laurie so that ALL of her living expenses <br/>
and school costs will be paid for as long as she chooses to attend. <br/>
He called several times after that and said, &quot;Are you SURE you&#39;re <br/>
REALLY going to attend our school? We are SO happy that you have <br/>
chosen us.&quot; {{{{{And to think she wondered at first if she&#39;d be <br/>
accepted.}}}}} <br/>
Oh, she (and YOU) must be SO proud, and what a nice umpft to her self esteem, <br/>
huh?  What a  gift you gave her by being such a radical mama!! : ) <br/>
