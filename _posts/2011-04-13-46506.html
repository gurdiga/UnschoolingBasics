<div id="ygrps-yiv-365220647">And I&#39;m not sure how to help.<br/>
My dd (13) wakes up every day and asks if we can go somewhere.  She<br/>
can&#39;t find something she&#39;s interested in, however.  Doesn&#39;t want to go<br/>
to the zoo.  Art museum isn&#39;t what she&#39;s in the mood for.  Doesn&#39;t want<br/>
to go to a book store.  I&#39;m thinking she just doesn&#39;t know what to do<br/>

friends in town (most homeschoolers end up going through the public<br/>

friends (who don&#39;t have time to hang out anyway).  Yesterday she bought<br/>
herself a mandolin but was surprised at how difficult it is to play.  I<br/>
offered to get her lessons so we&#39;re waiting to hear from the instructor.<br/>
In the mean time, she&#39;s just not sure what to do with her days and I&#39;m<br/>
afraid I don&#39;t really know how to help.  She&#39;s not interested in doing<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1751538586">Some ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Drive around with no destination in mind, stopping at any place that catches<br/>
your eye.<br/>
<br/>
Buy lots of arts and crafts stuff and just keep it around, play with it<br/>
yourself and invite her to join.  Some things I&#39;ve enjoyed recently are big<br/>
blocks of white Sculptey clay that I can mold and then paint after<br/>
baking, Chinese take out boxes (meant for gift wrapping) which I&#39;ve painted<br/>
in contrasting colors and put interesting Chinese symbols on them.  Another<br/>
big hit is various sized and shaped boxes from Michaels which we&#39;ve painted<br/>
with different designs.<br/>
<br/>
We also picked up some various wooden 3-D puzzles.  Draven (my 11 y/o) said<br/>
he&#39;d like me to paint them, but he wants to put them together, so that&#39;ll be<br/>
a joint project.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve made it a point to display all of Draven&#39;s 2-D artwork in frames, it<br/>
makes him feel better about the art (because it&#39;s more than just fridge art)<br/>
and makes wonderful decorations for the house.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1868507734">Does she want to go window shopping at the mall, thrift stores, try new make up <br/>
at the mall, go to the movies,<br/>
go have lunch somewhere different???<br/>
Don;t only think in terms of museums, books, etc. <br/>
Maybe do not ask but plan a girls day out. Go window shopping, then grab lunch <br/>
and a movie just for you two.<br/>
Maybe go get ice cream ???<br/>
Maybe go look at houses in a  fancy neighborhood??<br/>
 Try  a pedicure, a massage, a new hair-doo???<br/>
Go try a zumba o Taekwon Do class?<br/>
Go ice-skating?<br/>
Teen girls can be a fun partner!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-447882925">In addition to all the ideas: lots of sympathy and a willing ear. The  <br/>
transition between kid interests and teen interests can be frustrating  <br/>
for kids. Don&#39;t feel like it&#39;s your job to fix it so much as keep  <br/>
things swirling through her life for her to dabble with.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-89652992">I love the ideas (and mandolin links).  I can see the importance of<br/>
deschooling *for me* and that&#39;s something that has caught me by<br/>
surprise.  Not so much because I find myself thinking academics (the art<br/>
museum was an interest last month but apparently has lost its appeal),<br/>
but because I realize that for the last couple years, my interests have<br/>
revolved around things that allowed me to take a break from my kids. <br/>
These were &#39;escapes&quot; for me and so by nature, do not really lend<br/>
themselves to socializing.  There&#39;s no reason to continue that, however,<br/>
and I really don&#39;t feel any desire to take a break from my kids now,<br/>
even though I&#39;m finding myself doing more with and for them than before.<br/>
All these ideas sound so natural and yet I&#39;m finding myself trying to<br/>
come up with ideas rather than exploring what&#39;s around me as well.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Btw, we took a bike ride downtown and stopped and poked around a thrift<br/>
store.  That was fun.  Later dd went to a birthday party at a roller<br/>
rink and met a new friend.  She&#39;s feeling less isolated now so that&#39;s a<br/>
nice treat for her.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So thank you all!  I appreciate the ideas (and sympathy).<br/>
