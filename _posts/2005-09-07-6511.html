<div id="ygrps-yiv-1249561095">&lt;&lt;He is very much into<br/>
video gaming, and part of letting go of his friends<br/>
after this summer, was losing their companionship in<br/>
his interests. Maybe we&#39;ll have to broaden a bit and<br/>
get out more to see if anything else strikes his<br/>
fancy.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In response to the &quot;very much into&quot; video gaming...<br/>
I didn&#39;t know if you were aware of a *fairly new?*<br/>
place called Techie in Marlboro. It is all video<br/>
games. Some games are interconnected & they have<br/>
tournaments, etc.... <br/>
My son loves it, & so does his cousins & friends..<br/>
It is on the corner of HOsmer St & East Main ST and it<br/>
very inexpensive. $4 an hr. <br/>
<br/>
That *might* be a way for him to meet others<br/>
interested in the same thing. They also have a web<br/>
site if you&#39;d like to check it ahead of time.<br/>
