<div id="ygrps-yiv-485071682">FYI - Target&#39;s $1 section has some great back to school stuff!  I would say<br/>
most of it is pre-school elementary ages and some of it general teacher<br/>
decor like calendars and such.  Anyway, I just got Aden some alphabet and<br/>
number window clings.  He has been really focusing on letters and numbers so<br/>
I thought they would be fun.  I also got him some board books in that<br/>
section. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Speaking of back to school supplies, don&#39;t you just love it when they<br/>
put the crayons and markers and pencils and paper and notebook really<br/>
cheap?  We pick up a few things during the big sales, but we try to<br/>
hold off until the second week after school starts when they mark<br/>
everything down even further.  I jumped on Crayola markers being on<br/>
sale for 88¢ this week at Target! I also bought a 10 pack of spiral<br/>
notebooks as the kids go through those things like crazy with notes,<br/>
plays, drawings, games, doodling, crumpled ball cat toys :-)  When I<br/>
came in the door with this huge bag of &quot;school supplies&quot; Mary Elayne<br/>
(almost 11) decided to become melodramatic screaming, &quot;NO NO NO YOU<br/>
WON&#39;T SEND ME BACK TO SCHOOL!  I&#39;D RATHER DIE FIRST!  I&#39;M DYING! I&#39;M<br/>
DYING! I&#39;M DYING!&quot;  ROFL.  Then today we were at the grocery store and<br/>
there was a display of lunch boxes and she said, &quot;Mommy, save me from<br/>
the school lunch boxes.  Please tell me you aren&#39;t going to buy one<br/>
and send me to school!&quot;  I laughed and said, &quot;Why would I want to send<br/>
you to school?  No fear there!&quot;  Of course that got some very odd<br/>
looks from the stockboy ;)<br/>

day (45 minutes from me) and didn&#39;t check that section out!<br/>
