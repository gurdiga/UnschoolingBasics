<div id="ygrps-yiv-1524244293">OK folks, it seems that I am getting this unschooling idea wrapped <br/>
around my brain -- everywhere I go I find myself thinking &quot;hmm I bet <br/>
if that parent just tried this....&quot; Does anyone else do that?  I&#39;m <br/>
not trying to be judgemental but I&#39;m seeing how people react to kids <br/>
and I think -- &quot;geez, I&#39;ve done that but I bet if I just did this&quot; <br/>
the child would be much happier.  For instance, several times I see <br/>
children that are pretty young and the parent just expects the child <br/>
to sit in the high chair the whole time.  One day a little girl was <br/>
crying and crying and crying and I just knew that she only wanted <br/>
her mom to hold her!  but she wouldn&#39;t she made her sit in the high <br/>
chair.  now I understand that the mom&#39;s reaction was probably that <br/>
I&#39;m not going to reward her by holding her she needs to learn to <br/>
stop having a fit.  However!!???  I&#39;ve had the same thoughts so I <br/>
understand,, but to see from an outside angle made me re-think that <br/>
philosophy.  It also amazes me how many people (including myself) <br/>
have excepted spanking.  The other day at the daycare my boy goes to <br/>
the one lady even said she thinks that is why made buts... Now I <br/>
know she didn&#39;t and won&#39;t spank these kids but... since I&#39;ve been <br/>
researching and de-schooling I&#39;ve been really staying away from it.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh and then yesterday there was a gentlemen at the restaurant with a <br/>
boy that was probably around 5 -- Now in other peoples eyes (and <br/>
even mine a little, unfortunately) he seemed like an out right <br/>
brat.  First, he (the child) decided he wanted to change tables so <br/>
his dad let him (good dad -- let&#39;s avoid argument and why not?)  I <br/>
told that dad that sometimes we just have to do that.. I could tell <br/>
he was so relieved that someone understood why he let his child do <br/>
it.  The boy also kept wanting to leave the dining room go to the <br/>
restroom, play with salt and sugars, etc.  Even at one point the dad <br/>
was trying to get him to just sit up -- which wouldn&#39;t have been a <br/>
big deal except that he his feet were sticking out and people were <br/>
trying to pass.  Not once did that father, threaten to spank, yell <br/>
or anything.  I ended up talking with a bit and I could tell the dad <br/>
was glad to have someone that just understood.  BUt I could see <br/>
other families looking and making judgement calls.  However, I hate <br/>
it when parents gage how much there children should eat before they <br/>
get dessert.  HOw does the parent know that child isn&#39;t close to <br/>
full and has just enough room to eat that ice cream?  Would the <br/>
parent rather the child over eat (due to being pushed too) then eat <br/>
his dessert and eventually the child always overeats and may be over <br/>
weight...???   <br/>
<br/>
Anyway I&#39;m babbling and I&#39;m  not even sure I&#39;m getting my thoughts <br/>
out correctly.  I basically just find a rewarding that I can see my <br/>
mind shifting from old ways to some unschooling thoughts.   <br/>
<br/>
Now if I can just always apply them to in my household more!! <br/>
<br/>
By the way it has been happening more at home... when mommy let&#39;s go <br/>
if that darn control and just lets the day flow... the day does just <br/>
that flows very nicely -- perfect.   when that happens i find myself <br/>
so anxious to get to the point of truly unschooling my children and <br/>
letting my life be content and joyful..  <br/>
<br/>
thanks to this group I&#39;m learning...</div>
