<div id="ygrps-yiv-870606904">When my guys were younger, we&#39;d meet at various Rec. Centers here.<br/>
Most of them were at city parks, so if it happened that it was nice<br/>
enough to play outside, we could choose either one. Most of the time,<br/>
the rec. centers were free. There was one with an indoor play center<br/>
(like a McDonald&#39;s play place) that was $1/child each visit. We were<br/>
also members of a group that met regularly at a rec. center where we<br/>
paid $10/year/child. It was definitely worth it! They had rooms<br/>
available for crafts or games, a gym, a workout room, a game room with<br/>
a couple of arcade video games plus a foosball table, and then the<br/>
park outside. We&#39;d all pack lunch, and be there for hours. An<br/>
unschooling mom set that up with the rec. center.<br/>
<br/>
One of the rec. centers had those &quot;turtle&quot; things the kids could ride<br/>
around on in the gym, plus toddler basketball hoops and balls in<br/>
addition to the regular ones.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could check with your parks & rec department to see if they<br/>
have similar facilities?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1258636521">Hmm... you have an 11 yr old, so I&#39;m thinking you aren&#39;t looking for<br/>
young children play areas.  Sometimes you can rent space at the Y, or<br/>
if it is lower key (like board games), the library often has meeting<br/>
rooms you can reserve.  It varies so much by area, though.<br/>
<br/>
Florida has nice parks.... ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-983178331">Churches, someone with a large house, places with rec. centers, libraries, gyms, etc.  I know where I live there are plenty of indoor homeschool activities going on and they are usually at libraries or churches.  Also we have a place called Monkey Joe&#39;s here, one of those inflatable playground places, and usually all the homeschoolers meet there on occasion.  Even meeting at Mcdonald&#39;s with a playplace can be fun for the kids.<br/>
