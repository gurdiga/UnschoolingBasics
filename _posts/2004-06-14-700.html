<div id="ygrps-yiv-585573301">Yes and yes, imo. Common sense and trying to live well together. We all live <br/>
here, we all adjust our wishes and schedules to try to do what we, practically <br/>
and affordably, can. Mom feeling martyred isn&#39;t any better than the kid <br/>
feeling &quot;second class.&quot; IMO<br/>
