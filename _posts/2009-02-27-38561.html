<div id="ygrps-yiv-1041214599">I would like to do an article for the Maryland Homeschooled news about<br/>
well known and fictional homeschooled people.<br/>
<br/>
There are a few lists of well-known people who were homeschooled, but I&#39;m<br/>
curious about fictional characters that were homeschooled - especially<br/>
any that are found in popular culture.<br/>
<br/>
Some examples that I can come up with are Dharma from the television show<br/>
&quot;Dharma and Greg&quot; and the kids on the show &quot;The Wild Thornberry&#39;s&quot;.<br/>
Does anyone else know of any others??<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you also know of any famous homeschooled people nonfiction, let me<br/>
know as well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-726951451">Oh, I really have to say that I think Momo by Michael Ende is an absolutely wonderful book (http://www.amazon.com/Momo-Puffin-Books-Michael-Ende/dp/0140317538). Growing up in Germany it was one of my favorite books, not really about unschooling or homeschooling, but about a little girl who never went to school and has a amazing ability to &#39;listen&#39; and just be herself. In come the Grey men who come to steal peoples time and start putting the children in day care away from the parents. When I wanted to find the book in English years ago for my niece in English I had a really hard time finding it, no doubt because it is highly critical of the way society functions now.<br/>
Highly to be recommended!<br/>
Pippi Longstocking was not homeschooled, she just grows up without parents (a pirate dad at sea who does visit every now and then, and a mama up in heaven) and thinks she does not need school, she learns plenty from life. Also a wonderful book.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-369383491">Pippi Longstocking lived alone with her horse and her monkey. Her dad was captured by cannibals and made their king as you find in Pippi Longstocking in the South Seas. She isn&#39;t unschooled. She is a girl who makes her own life. And who has bags of gold. She goes to school briefly and the teacher is quite happy when Pippi decides that school isn&#39;t for her.

school for one day because she was jealous that she would not get a <br/>
Christmas Vacation when the time came.  My son thought that was very <br/>
funny as he realized of course that everyday is a vacation.  He <br/>
realized how that connected to his life too.  Her emphasis on the <br/>
importance of education was in a it must be important cause everyone <br/>
says it is way.  She thought what they were learning was ridiculous, <br/>
however, and it was very clear that she thought what she learned <br/>
through real life experiences made much more sence.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-119419852">The main character in Mean Girls was homeschooled until her senior<br/>
year, when she went to high school so girls could be mean to her. <br/>
<br/>
The members of of the bluegrass trio Nickel Creek homeschooled so they<br/>
could pursue a career as musicians. That turned out pretty well.</div>
