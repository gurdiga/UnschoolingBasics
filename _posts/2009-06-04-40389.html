<div id="ygrps-yiv-341693373">I was interviewed by Debbie H who doing a series with many unschoolers and it&#39;s now up at her &quot;Homeschooling; freedom and fun for your family&quot; blog.<br/>

<br/>
Be sure to check out the archives as there are interviews with several of our members here at the list, including Pam Sorooshian, Deb Rossing, Laura Endres and others. There are interviews with Sandra Dodd and Helen Hegener and probably several others I didn&#39;t even see yet.:)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a really fun series and the interviews are quick reads. Check it out!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-347235019">Me too!  Debbie is really making this fun. Also, taken as a whole these interviews with so many different families are building into a good resource to give newbie local moms with little kids, so they can see home education needn&#39;t just be Sunday School with a boxed curriculum . . .Our interview is new up today, and Nance Confer of this list will be coming soon.<br/>
