<div id="ygrps-yiv-1292377748">I&#39;m here!  I don&#39;t define success as attending any ivy league college, or<br/>
any college at all for that matter.  If my (very young) sons choose college,<br/>
fine, if they don&#39;t, fine.  We already talk about all of the things they<br/>
could do w/out going to college.<br/>
My definition of success, one which I share with them often, is a feeling of<br/>
peace about who you are, knowing who you are and what is important to you,<br/>
and living life doing only the things that bring you utter bliss.<br/>
I went to college, because that&#39;s what I was &#39;supposed&#39; to do.  Now, my<br/>
teachers certificate sits there in a filing cabinet, with thousands of<br/>
dollars of paid off student loans sitting behind it.  I always wish someone<br/>
would have shared other options with me; hey karen, have you thought about<br/>
traveling?  backpacking around the country/world?  peace corps?<br/>
I would have made a different decision, I&#39;m almost certain of that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2068482255">oh tina, i am so glad you asked this question.  i feel the very same way and when asked about &quot;success&quot; this is how i have described a possible scenario for success for one of my kids:<br/>
   <br/>
  my son is an artist and i said that my idea of success for him would be that he make a living doing his artwork....BUT....i also think that success would be that he find a little place he could afford that has good working space in it and that he has few bills so he can maybe work at some coffee shop and make enough working part time to live on and the rest of his time he spends doing something he really really loves.  that would be success...total success.  happiness=success, it is that simple.  if that means school for some people, then so be it.  if my son wants to go to school one day to learn more about something, that will be his choice but it won&#39;t be about &quot;becoming&quot; successful, it will be just another avenue to learning something (like anything else he chooses to do to learn something new)<br/>
   <br/>
  that&#39;s my version of success...and i&#39;m sure i&#39;ve got tons more, but for different things.<br/>
   <br/>
  good discussion topic!!<br/>

<br/>
I agree 100% with that idea.  I would love to be surrounded by <br/>
people that think along the same line.  I&#39;m almost 36, a Domestic <br/>
Engineer, a wife, mother, grandmother and facilitator to my <br/>
children.  Due to my upbringing, I&#39;m sure, I am still trying very <br/>
actively to find what brings me utter bliss.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I went to college, because that&#39;s what I was &#39;supposed&#39; to do.  <br/>

karen, have you thought about traveling?  backpacking around the <br/>
country/world?  peace corps? I would have made a different decision, <br/>
I&#39;m almost certain of that.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I did something similar.  Although, I tended to do things the &quot;hard&quot; <br/>
way the rebel that I was.  (I say tongue in cheek)  I had my first <br/>
child very young, graduated high school with my class, went to <br/>
community college under the thumb of my grandfather.  There was so <br/>
much control and stress there it wasn&#39;t funny.  I quit and just <br/>
lived and worked for a while.  Then on my own accord went to <br/>
business school and graduated with a good GPA.  This was when I was <br/>
in my twenties, had two children and was supporting myself and <br/>
figuring things out on my own.  <br/>
<br/>
In hindsight, I wish I would have had someone showing me how to <br/>
think outside the box.  Why did I feel the only way to have a life <br/>
was through continued education?  I still get stuck on this spot.  <br/>
My husband and I have the same struggle.  Here I am trying to <br/>
instill in my children that there are choices outside of <br/>
institutionalized education, but I haven&#39;t even figured out how to <br/>
have a life outside of the very institution I am trying to get them <br/>
to stretch their thinking outside of.<br/>
<br/>
Hence my query of others.  The Peace Corps, backpacking across <br/>
Europe, traveling the U.S. or the world...all these things are <br/>
possible.  I know that.  What I just can&#39;t get my brain around is <br/>
how.  As I mentioned above, my husband and I are struggling with <br/>
this very issue.  We have been for years.  He is in a tough <br/>
profession, transmission mechanic.  We have owned our own business, <br/>
but it was inner-city and tough to run.  We&#39;d like to go back into <br/>
business for ourselves, but we&#39;d like to do something different.  We <br/>
are desperately trying to figure out HOW to make that happen.  <br/>
Progress is being made, but by no means are we even certain of WHAT <br/>
it is we want to do.<br/>
<br/>
In regard to our children, how have other unschoolers achieved their <br/>
bliss OUTSIDE of institutional education?  How have parents of <br/>
unschoolers transformed their lives to follow their personal bliss?  <br/>
How are others doing this?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks - Tina</div>

  i totally feel this...we are still paying student loans and i haven&#39;t been in school since &#39;93...i still have about 10 more years to pay....that&#39;s a freakin&#39; house by then!!!<br/>
   <br/>
  i too wish someone had pointed me in a different direction (or had i read &quot;teenage liberation handbook&quot;) but i can&#39;t dwell on that now.  i can use that &quot;wish&quot; to make it a reality for my kids...giving them what i wish i&#39;d had.  i&#39;ve healed a lot of my &quot;school&quot; wounds just by giving my kids differently.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1705520976">I unschooled myself, though I didn&#39;t know the word for it. I started<br/>
extricating myself from school around age 12 and left completely at 15.<br/>
(Even before then, I followed a  very unschooly path and resisted the<br/>
efforts of teachers and parents to train my curiosity.) Unfortunately, I<br/>
also had to leave home, because my mother wouldn&#39;t support any decision that<br/>
wasn&#39;t &quot;normal&quot;. She even turned down a chance for me<br/>
&lt;?auth=DQAAAG8AAADVJwWqT9hGTwG_wnqYg3_FOirTCw7fSC7dcgdGhz_fQchymBV_bKd1D8rM2XI3FX2ezUlR57AcL8b4nUpH__fuISqAoX4SjagTvRICnf44VrT7MyVBe3LGZuaMRUvIP-31m-bFFkvfp0dOQ7TyaEEM&gt;to<br/>
finish my high school diploma while attending classes at the local community<br/>
college, because &quot;you have to do what everyone else is doing&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
So I took it upon myself to seek an education of my own making. I&#39;ve never<br/>
been to college, and didn&#39;t graduate high school. I&#39;ve never made very much<br/>
money, but I&#39;ve also never made it a priority in life.  Instead I&#39;ve focused<br/>
on self-directed learning and building joyful relationships, including, now,<br/>
with my child.  I&#39;ve met many amazing people from all walks of life, and<br/>
encountered a great diversity of ideas and information.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m 27 now, stay at home dad to a young toddler, and starting my own<br/>
business (slowly, because the child is the priority right now). I feel<br/>
successful in many ways, including that I know I&#39;m free to spend the rest of<br/>
my life jumping from interest to interest if that&#39;s what I like, as my<br/>
daughter is as well. My life isn&#39;t perfect, but I&#39;ve never regretted<br/>
deschooling for a moment. I might have reached this place regardless, but I<br/>
know it would have taken longer.<br/>

There are a lot of them. I think the college successes get talked<br/>
about more, because it&#39;s what people want to hear.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe Kelly will come on and talk about Cameron....he&#39;s not attending<br/>
college (doesn&#39;t mean he never will) but at 18 he&#39;s living an active,<br/>
full and interesting life of his choosing. <br/>
<br/>
Peter Kowalke actually tried college and decided it wasn&#39;t for him.<br/>
<br/>
Barb Lundgren&#39;s (of the Rethinking Education conference in TX) son<br/>
spent some time homeless as a social experiment.:) I believe for three<br/>
months or some such time.....<br/>
He&#39;s extremely bright and interesting from all accounts, but not<br/>
interested in fitting any mainstream ideals. Neat kid.<br/>
<br/>
My Trevor is 17 in just weeks and has no desire to get his drivers<br/>
license yet, or even think about moving away or go to college. He&#39;s<br/>
interesting, fun and a delight to be around but certainly not winning<br/>
awards or doing anything to set the world on fire at this time!<br/>
<br/>
I know that if college becomes important to any of these kids, they&#39;ll<br/>
use it as ONE tool among many in this life, not the end-all-be-all<br/>
that most people seem to think it is.<br/>

<br/>
Exactly.<br/>
Your past is exactly that...PAST. We can all live the lives of our<br/>
choosing at any time. Nobody said it&#39;s easy to make those changes, but<br/>
the story we write for ourselves is our CHOICE. Plain and simple.<br/>
<br/>
The adults in most of our lives didn&#39;t know any better. They had the<br/>
puritanical education and work ethic pounded into them also. If you<br/>
think about unschooling from a historical perspective, we&#39;re really<br/>
living in extreme luxury to even be discussing and debating this<br/>
lifestyle.<br/>
<br/>
Most people have to focus so much on survival, the idea of &quot;living the<br/>
life of your choosing&quot; wouldn&#39;t be comprehendable. I think we OWE the<br/>
universe an amazing life, as a way to help this earth evolve forward.:)<br/>
I think we&#39;re helping point the arrow of evolution by grabbing hold of<br/>
the wealth of opportunities we enjoy and MASSIVE abundance and living<br/>
the life of our dreams!<br/>
<br/>
The world can change through such actions. I know that the things we<br/>
LOVE to do, the passions we have are still alive even when ignored.<br/>
What is it that natters at you late into the night? What joyful<br/>
activity do you tell yourself isn&#39;t practical? What desires are you<br/>
trying to ignore because you &quot;can&#39;t afford it&quot; or &quot;don&#39;t have time&quot;?<br/>
THOSE are the very things your heart and soul need to be doing.<br/>
Find a way.  Even if it&#39;s baby steps....little steps towards the<br/>
things you love brings great PEACE.<br/>
<br/>
I recently made a commitment to myself about some of those &quot;baby<br/>
steps&quot;  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://teawithren.blogspot.com/">http://teawithren.blogspot.com/</a><br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1967161600">We don&#39;t care whether or not our boys go to college, or ever to any kind of school.  Personally, I&#39;d rather they not go to college, at least not unless they&#39;re convinced that&#39;s the necessary path to the life they want.  I never went to college.  Dh went to college because he was expected to -- it took him 3 yrs to declare a major, then he hated that field once he&#39;d graduated.  It took him some 25 yrs to find work he loves.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I shudder to think about the cost of university -- estimates I&#39;ve heard say it will cost $200,000+ for today&#39;s young children to go to college.  Yikes!  The debt that would leave on a young person just starting out in his career is crushing -- three times the size of our mortgage, for crying out loud.  If they do college, I&#39;m going to strongly encourage local community colleges and state colleges, just for the cost alone.<br/>

<br/>
  *****<br/>
   <br/>
  I once had a 17yo who had no desire to get his driver&#39;s license.  He&#39;s become a 21yo who doesn&#39;t have a driver&#39;s license -- still baffles his Dad.  He had a license and a car  briefly -- maybe 6 mos - when he lived away from home in North Carolina, where there wasn&#39;t any mass transit.  He came back to New Mexico, and decided that owning a car just wasn&#39;t worth the expense or trouble -- insurance, fuel, repairs, etc. His solution was to find an apartment within an easy walk of work, the grocery store, laundromat, a few restaurants and two city bus routes.  If he really needs to go somewhere - or do his laundry without quarters -- he calls me for a ride, which gives me an excuse to spend a day with him!  <br/>
   <br/>
  Really, his life is what I would consider a success, especially at 21yo.  He only unschooled 2 yrs, after 11 years of public school, so his story really doesn&#39;t fit this question, except that I consider his choices to be successful, and acceptable for the younger boys when they grow up.  Will (my 21yo ds) works at a job he really enjoys, has his own apartment, pays his bills on time, visits us every couple of weeks, calls more often.  He has friends, and time to read or hang out -- most of all, he&#39;s happy and confident and growing every day, learning more about life every day.  It doesn&#39;t get more successful than that in my book.<br/>

<br/>
I think it&#39;s hard for people to imagine a 17y.o. that is perfectly<br/>
happy with his life as it is, and feels no need to change anything at<br/>
this time. Age is so arbitrary. Just because 16 makes it legal to<br/>
drive, doesn&#39;t mean every 16y.o. is ready or even wants to.<br/>
<br/>
Most kids want to do everything at the earliest age possible because<br/>
adults are holding them back. Unschooled kids get to grow into<br/>
responsibility as they&#39;re ready. Some will want to drive before 16,<br/>
some won&#39;t care until their 20&#39;s probably.<br/>
<br/>
One of our best friends is 18 and doesn&#39;t want to drive yet.<br/>
They can get where they want to go, whenever they want and they don&#39;t<br/>
really want the extra responsiblity just yet. They&#39;ll grow into it<br/>
when they&#39;re ready. In the meantime, I&#39;m happy to not try and figure<br/>
out how I&#39;ll afford the insurance on him!!<br/>

  That&#39;s how we felt -- the idea of paying for insurance for 17yo was scary.  Some people never grow into driving -- neither of my grandmothers ever drove. My Mom didn&#39;t drive until she was almost 30, and I was 18 before I drove.  Some people who live in cities with great mass transit, never need to own a car anyway.<br/>

It&#39;s hard for me to image a 17yo not wanting to drive. My 16yo needs her car.<br/>
But that probably has more to do with the fact we live in the middle of nowhere <br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
I once had a 17yo who had no desire to get his driver&#39;s license. He&#39;s become a 21yo who doesn&#39;t have a driver&#39;s license -- still baffles his Dad. He had a license and a car briefly -- maybe 6 mos - when he lived away from home in North Carolina, where there wasn&#39;t any mass transit. He came back to New Mexico, and decided that owning a car just wasn&#39;t worth the expense or trouble -- insurance, fuel, repairs, etc. His solution was to find an apartment within an easy walk of work, the grocery store, laundromat, a few restaurants and two city bus routes. If he really needs to go somewhere - or do his laundry without quarters -- he calls me for a ride, which gives me an excuse to spend a day with him! <br/>
<br/>
Really, his life is what I would consider a success, especially at 21yo. He only unschooled 2 yrs, after 11 years of public school, so his story really doesn&#39;t fit this question, except that I consider his choices to be successful, and acceptable for the younger boys when they grow up. Will (my 21yo ds) works at a job he really enjoys, has his own apartment, pays his bills on time, visits us every couple of weeks, calls more often. He has friends, and time to read or hang out -- most of all, he&#39;s happy and confident and growing every day, learning more about life every day. It doesn&#39;t get more successful than that in my book.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1319688716">Florida has the Bright Futures Scholarships that pays 75% - 100% of the state college tuition if they score well on their SAT, etc...  Homeschoolers are also eligible.  (I have been told not to mention unschooling as people don&#39;t get it.) There&#39;s no way I could afford to pay the current prices.  Even the Community Colleges are around $90. a credit hour.  Quite pricey.<br/>

We don&#39;t care whether or not our boys go to college, or ever to any kind of school. Personally, I&#39;d rather they not go to college, at least not unless they&#39;re convinced that&#39;s the necessary path to the life they want. I never went to college. Dh went to college because he was expected to -- it took him 3 yrs to declare a major, then he hated that field once he&#39;d graduated. It took him some 25 yrs to find work he loves. <br/>
<br/>
I shudder to think about the cost of university -- estimates I&#39;ve heard say it will cost $200,000+ for today&#39;s young children to go to college. Yikes! The debt that would leave on a young person just starting out in his career is crushing -- three times the size of our mortgage, for crying out loud. If they do college, I&#39;m going to strongly encourage local community colleges and state colleges, just for the cost alone.<br/>

Exactly.<br/>
Your past is exactly that...PAST. We can all live the lives of our<br/>
choosing at any time. Nobody said it&#39;s easy to make those changes, but<br/>
the story we write for ourselves is our CHOICE. Plain and simple.<br/>
<br/>
The adults in most of our lives didn&#39;t know any better. They had the<br/>
puritanical education and work ethic pounded into them also. If you<br/>
think about unschooling from a historical perspective, we&#39;re really<br/>
living in extreme luxury to even be discussing and debating this<br/>
lifestyle.<br/>
<br/>
Most people have to focus so much on survival, the idea of &quot;living the<br/>
life of your choosing&quot; wouldn&#39;t be comprehendable. I think we OWE the<br/>
universe an amazing life, as a way to help this earth evolve forward.:)<br/>
I think we&#39;re helping point the arrow of evolution by grabbing hold of<br/>
the wealth of opportunities we enjoy and MASSIVE abundance and living<br/>
the life of our dreams!<br/>
<br/>
The world can change through such actions. I know that the things we<br/>
LOVE to do, the passions we have are still alive even when ignored.<br/>
What is it that natters at you late into the night? What joyful<br/>
activity do you tell yourself isn&#39;t practical? What desires are you<br/>
trying to ignore because you &quot;can&#39;t afford it&quot; or &quot;don&#39;t have time&quot;?<br/>
THOSE are the very things your heart and soul need to be doing.<br/>
Find a way. Even if it&#39;s baby steps....little steps towards the<br/>
things you love brings great PEACE.<br/>

  i think that this is a big reason for unschooling for me.  it has as much given me back to myself as it has allowed my kids to be themselves.  i think for a lot of us, unschooling is a big part of healing ourselves and learning to let go of all the old ways of thinking and doing.  it may not sound like it, but i have come a long way.  i work everyday on those voices and watching my children bloom inspires me all the time.<br/>

I am interested in a different perspective.  Honestly, all the mind-<br/>
blowing success is rather intimidating to me.  Is there anyone out<br/>
there that has unschooled to young adulthood that is successful and<br/>
didn&#39;t attend college?  Is there anyone out there with a more simple<br/>
idea of success?  Is there anyone that defines success outside the<br/>
paramaters of extended, institutional education?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to hear your ideas and experiences...<br/>

Cameron has been successful so many times before he even HIT college <br/>
age. I think the best part of that was that he was able to see that he <br/>
could &quot;make it&quot; without the college degree. Magic, music, film, <br/>
sports---he could make a living at any of them.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s always felt his weakness was school---school subjects like reading <br/>
and math. He never felt like a success there, even though he was a <br/>
*good* student. There were always *better* students who got the coveted <br/>
As. Then his crazy mom pulls him OUT of school---maybe she thought he <br/>
wasn&#39;t *smart* enough for school? I think there was a lot of doubt <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
Oddly, this is where he is right now. His weaknesses.<br/>
<br/>
I reminded him that we don&#39;t focus on our weaknesses. That&#39;s what <br/>
*schools* do. We celebrate strengths. I told him I didn&#39;t want him to <br/>
worry about what he can&#39;t do, but celebrate what he can---delve further <br/>
into *those* things.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, he&#39;s just written an article for Danielle&#39;s <br/>
_Connections_ about Not Back To School Camp. It&#39;s the first thing&#39;s <br/>
he&#39;s written since leaving school. His big weakness has just proved NOT <br/>
to be! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s started to write poetry. He&#39;s baking bread and cooking (salmon <br/>
with wild rice, green beans, and salad for supper last night. Mushroom <br/>
soup last week). He&#39;s looking at spending a week at The Farm ecovillage <br/>
in the spring. He has a busy house/pet-sitting service. He wants to <br/>
travel across the US by car with a friend or two. He&#39;s filming a <br/>
behind-the-scenes documentary for some friends---starring Patti Duke. <br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He *is* looking at college, but not as the be-all, end-all. I don&#39;t <br/>
know that he will go full-time. Maybe just sit in on a few classes or <br/>
take a few hours here and there. We may go visit ASU in the next few <br/>
weeks, just for kicks.<br/>
<br/>
He visits his girlfriend, friends, and cousin at college and is <br/>
unimpressed with their attitudes and maturity levels. It&#39;s all about <br/>
getting drunk, staying up late, and belittling each other.  So it&#39;s not <br/>
*that* he&#39;s looking for.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s not *sure* what he wants to do right now, but I remind him he <br/>
doesn&#39;t have to make that decision *NOW*. He has his life to make <br/>
decisions and change them. He&#39;s not sure he wants to drum for a living <br/>
right now. That could change. He may dump it. He may go back to it. But <br/>
it&#39;s consumed his life for years now.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever his decision, it wasn&#39;t wasted time. He&#39;s made all SORTS of <br/>
connections these last few years---not only with drums, but with <br/>
baseball, skating, magic, music, and film. ALL of them are important <br/>
and can (and already *have*) led to more connections and new ideas and <br/>
interesting people.<br/>
<br/>
He feels a little in limbo right now---but I&#39;ve assured him that&#39;s not <br/>
uncommon at this age! &lt;G&gt; He still doesn&#39;t know &quot;what he wants to be.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He has SOOO many options and interests. He&#39;s open to new people and new <br/>
places. He&#39;s *EAGER* to learn more. It&#39;s that eagerness that shows *me* <br/>
he&#39;ll be just fine.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect he&#39;ll find his &quot;home&quot; in the arts---writing, sculpting, <br/>
drawing, music, film, magic, performance art---but it could be in <br/>
opening a coffee house for musicians or organizing a camp for <br/>
unschoolers! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The man loves life. He loves learning. He loves doing and being and <br/>
trying new things.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s just fine. He&#39;s an unschooler.<br/>
