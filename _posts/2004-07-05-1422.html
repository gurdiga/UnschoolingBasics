<div id="ygrps-yiv-883903141">Ack.  You know, sometimes I don&#39;t know exactly where to draw the<br/>
line.  One day at the community college, Jay climbed just a short<br/>
way up one of the trees.  I was fine with it.  But an<br/>
administrator/teacher/something... came by and yelled at him to get<br/>
down.  I assumed it had something to do with liability?  You might<br/>
know, Pam.  What&#39;s up with that?  Now I&#39;m never sure when we&#39;re out<br/>
if a wall or tree is &quot;ok&quot; or if someone is going to come by and<br/>
holler at us.  Amazing how a single incident will make you<br/>
paranoid.  I will need to make sure I&#39;m very conscious about these<br/>
things... and not succumb to my knee jerk &quot;someone is going to yell<br/>
at us&quot; reaction.  See now I&#39;m feeling a mite crappy because I know<br/>
that since then there have been several instances where I&#39;ve<br/>
disallowed his climbing in a public place due to fear of getting in<br/>
trouble.  I just hate when strangers take it upon themselves to<br/>
fuss.  And they do.<br/>
<br/>
**************************************************<br/>
<br/>
This reminded me of a situation that happened to me in my early twenties.<br/>
My mom and I were traveling on tour in Morocco.  We had left the pre-dinner<br/>
cocktail party<br/>
early to go for a walk  We saw two beautiful lion statues and thought it<br/>
would make a nice<br/>
picture.  I climbed up some steps and wrapped one arm around the lion for a<br/>
candid pose and suddenly<br/>
heard yelling and froze.  There were two military men with machine guns<br/>
pointed directly at me.  They<br/>
were yelling in a foreign language and my mom was quite freaked out as well.<br/>
It was the first time<br/>
I had ever had a gun of any kind drawn on me.  Apparantly it was a<br/>
government building and they<br/>
were very upset.  We took no more pictures but at least we have that one for<br/>
posterity.  I still<br/>
have that little bit of trauma imprint in my psyche and am cautious at any<br/>
public building now.<br/>
