<div id="ygrps-yiv-2105067562">?great source for black & white illustrations is Clipart ETC. The copyright policy allows up to 50 illustrations in a single educational project. They have some nice &quot;period&quot; illustrations, as well as plenty of pictures of historical figures. I find these are helpful to include illustrations with greyscale texts, for making colouring sheets, lapbooks, timelines, etc.<br/>
