<div id="ygrps-yiv-1961520082">My dh and I got to talking today as we did our normal Saturday family <br/>
house cleaning about family living being the same as community <br/>
living.  This meaning that it takes EVERYONE in the group doing their <br/>
part to make it all work.  This means that no one should walk away <br/>
from a job that needs done, nor should they leave a mess/work for <br/>
someone else or the community or family will break down and it won&#39;t <br/>
work. <br/>
This is what triggered our conversation:<br/>
6 yr old DD finished breakfast and left her cereal bowl on the table-<br/>
with milk still in it (which then was dumped all over the table as <br/>
her little sister 2 yr old, played in it).  This left double work for <br/>
me (or anyone else that came along to clean up), because not only did <br/>
the cereal bowl need carried to the kitchen, but now milk had to be <br/>
cleaned up too.  <br/>
<br/>
Our feeling is that everyone should pick up after themselves and not <br/>
make more work for others.  Taking responsibility for themselves and <br/>
their actions.  This way the family/community runs smoothly.  This <br/>
also allows more time to be together as a family (not mom and dad <br/>
constantly busy cleaning up after everyone).  <br/>
<br/>
So, how would you handle this?  <br/>
To me, it really isn&#39;t fair for one person to be doing all the work. <br/>
Also, what are the kids learning if they aren&#39;t taking responsibility <br/>
for themselves?  That someone will always be there to do it, so it <br/>
isn&#39;t a big deal????  What a shocker it would be for them when there <br/>
is no one to do it for them later in life!  I have seen this happen!  <br/>
Are we really doing right as parents by not teaching them to be <br/>
responsible for themselves?  What about as a part of society as a <br/>
whole?  Are they learning in a way that they can be part of a <br/>
community?  OR are they learning to be part of the &quot;me&quot; society (they <br/>
are the only ones important and community isn&#39;t)?  <br/>
Any thoughts?  <br/>
<br/>
Hope that makes sense.  I don&#39;t always choose the best &quot;wording&quot; <br/>
sometimes, so please forgive me that.   These are just our ponderings <br/>
today.  :)<br/>

 <br/>
She was taking responsibility for herself----just not the bowl and the  <br/>
cleanliness of your kitchen. There was probably something else that attracted  her <br/>
attention. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>

is no one to do it for them later in life!  I have seen this  happen!  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
You have really seen this behavior from children of MINDFUL parents?  REALLY? <br/>
How many of us do you know? MY children have watched me model kindness  and g<br/>
enerosity----and you know what? They&#39;re kind and generous! I give *much* of  <br/>
my time cleaning up after them; in exchange, they go out of their way to be <br/>
kind  and generous to me---and even clean up after *me*! <br/>
 <br/>
It didn&#39;t happen all at once. At first *I* was the only one who did  <br/>
anything. Cameron would walk out as I labored in the yard and ask whether I  needed <br/>
help. I&#39;d say only if he *wanted* to help. He had a hard time  understanding <br/>
this: all his friends had chores----lots of them. I said I was  willing to wait <br/>
until HE *wanted* to help. He didn&#39;t want to. I smiled and  thanked him for <br/>
asking and told him to have a good time with his friends.<br/>
 <br/>
One day he just came out and helped. We haven&#39;t looked back. He helps ALL  <br/>
the time. I come home to a spotless kitchen. He picks up the den. He  unloads <br/>
the dishwasher. He scoops poop. He carries groceries. His room is the  neatest <br/>
room in the house.<br/>
 <br/>
He has a pet/house-sitting business. He&#39;s so responsible you can&#39;t  <br/>
imagine---you probably really can&#39;t imagine if you think this has to be forced!  &lt;g&gt; He <br/>
gets up @ 6:30 to feed the dogs, he brings in the mail and paper,  he waters <br/>
the plants, he cleans the house, he washes the dishes, he washes and  changes <br/>
the sheets, and he writes a note about how it all went.<br/>
 <br/>
He&#39;s not the exception. He&#39;s the rule among these children who have had  this <br/>
behavior modelled for them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

are the only ones important and community isn&#39;t)?   <br/>
Any thoughts?  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
All these examples are of grown children whose parents MADE them clean up  <br/>
after themselves. They figure that if *they* didn&#39;t make the mess, *they* don&#39;t  <br/>
have to clean it up. I&#39;d rather have a grown child who is happy to clean up  <br/>
because it is nicer that way, because he *wants* to, because he wants a nice  <br/>
environment. <br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
You&#39;re not being realistic. Community doesn&#39;t work like that (mostly  because <br/>
people have been made to clean up after themselves). There are those  that <br/>
don&#39;t contribute to the mess, those that don&#39;t contribute to the clean-up,  <br/>
those that make the messes, those that do the cleaning up----and everything in  <br/>
between. The best thing we can do for our children is to joyfully clean up and  <br/>
show them that we value a clean space/world. They will follow our example.  <br/>
Forcing clean-up will only make the cleaner resentful if he&#39;s not doing it of  <br/>
his own free will. *You* are already are feeling resentful for having to  clean <br/>
up after her---what are you modeling? Really?<br/>
 <br/>
I was mowing the grass earlier this week, thinking of this very  situation. <br/>
Our neighbors have a lawn care service that comes weekly. He (the  lawn care <br/>
guy) pointed out that didn&#39;t I have a teenage son and why wasn&#39;t  he mowing the <br/>
lawn? I said I *liked* mowing the lawn. <br/>
 <br/>
Many of Cameron&#39;s friends are forced to help around the house because &quot;it&#39;s  <br/>
*their* house too and they need to take responsibility of *their* house.&quot; At <br/>
the  same time, they told that they aren&#39;t allowed to do such-and-such &quot;not <br/>
while  you&#39;re living under *MY* roof.&quot;  Talk about mixed signals!<br/>
 <br/>
What you&#39;re suggesting is really opposite from what actually works. We  have <br/>
living, breathing proof of this. Come to the conference. See for  yourself!<br/>

 <br/>
Replying to my own post! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d rather have a grown child who  will clean up after *someone else* as well <br/>
just because he thinks it would be  good and nice and right. Some people <br/>
can&#39;t clean up after themselves. Some are  too tired or too busy or too engrossed <br/>
in something. <br/>
 <br/>
Modeled kindness goes along way.<br/>

<br/>
I often think about this when the subject of cleaning up after oneself<br/>
arises.  I have a friend, who was the youngest of 7 children.  She wasn&#39;t<br/>
expected to clean up after herself or help do anything around the house.<br/>
When she was 17, and had a job her mom would iron all of her clothes for her<br/>
and make her lunch.<br/>
    I asked her what she thought about how she grew up and for her opinion<br/>
on chores and such.  Her response kind of surprised me.  She wished that her<br/>
mom had made her do her own laundry and clean the house.  She said that when<br/>
she went to college out of state she was terrified, because she didn&#39;t know<br/>
how to do anything.  She used to call her mom, crying because she felt so<br/>
insecure.  Her mom always did the cleaning and care of the house in front of<br/>
her, but it was up to my friend whether she wanted to participate or not.<br/>
Most of the time she chose not to, and in the end didn&#39;t pick up on how<br/>
things were done.<br/>
   I don&#39;t require that my kids do chores or pick up after themselves, but<br/>
what happens when they are ready to move out.  Maybe being homeschooled,<br/>
which my friend was not, will make the difference here.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
***But it IS fair to have slave labor?***<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny you should mention slave labor, because sometimes I feel like I&#39;m<br/>
the slave in this house.  We live on a farm and the flies will drive you<br/>
batty if you don&#39;t make sure that the counters and tables are clean.  This<br/>
doesn&#39;t go well with the theory that I have of allowing my little ones to<br/>
choose their own eating schedules and not requiring them to pick up after<br/>
themselves.  I also don&#39;t have a designated eating area so their free to eat<br/>
wherever and whenever they please, which is how it should be.  The only<br/>
downfall is that I feel like hired help sometimes that doesn&#39;t get paid.<br/>
Now, I don&#39;t think they intend to make me feel this way, but it does and I<br/>
try my hardest not to be a martyr about it.  I&#39;ll admit though sometimes I<br/>
just get tired of walking around the house picking up drinkables, Popsicle<br/>
sticks, broccoli, spilled milk etc...  My kids are young and maybe they will<br/>
eventually want to help me out, but what if they don&#39;t?  The only light I<br/>
can see at the end of the tunnel is that they may grow up and not have the<br/>
same hang-ups I have in regards to cleaning the house.  Maybe they will find<br/>
cleaning the house a positive thing not something they dread doing, like I<br/>
do.  I think of my mother every time I clean and believe me it&#39;s not nice<br/>
thoughts.  I am trying really hard to not send that feeling to my kids, so I<br/>
hum and sing a lot while I clean just to keep my mind off it.<br/>
<br/>
Hope I&#39;m doing the right thing.<br/>

<br/>
This is why I started humming and singing while I clean, because there was a<br/>
time when I was the martyr.  Now I try to make a game out of cleaning, but a<br/>
game I only play myself.  I don&#39;t expect them to clean with me anymore and<br/>
that has freed me from the martyr feelings.<br/>
   I also started thinking about how I would feel if I was really working<br/>
hard on something and someone came and stopped me just to put it in a bin.<br/>
Now I ask if they are done with things instead of saying, &quot;o.k. now it&#39;s<br/>
pick up time&quot;.<br/>
    I have come so far with this.  Sometimes I just get tired (there are 6<br/>
of us here) and don&#39;t know enough to just let it go for a day.  I will have<br/>
to work on that.<br/>

While cleaning the toilets, be glad that they&#39;re out of diapers!<br/>
 <br/>
While gardening, be happy you have such a great yard for them to play  in.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1900975500">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  I asked her what she thought about how she grew up and for her<br/>
opinion<br/>
on chores and such.  Her response kind of surprised me.  She wished that her<br/>

she went to college out of state she was terrified, because she didn&#39;t know<br/>
how to do anything. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There is this myth that since we don&#39;t force our children to do anything in<br/>
the household arena, that they therefore never do anything, or learn how to<br/>
do anything.<br/>
<br/>
The universal experience of long term Unschoolers is the opposite. <br/>

I think the problem for the girl who didn&#39;t know how to do all that stuff is<br/>
that her mom probably didn&#39;t ask her. I don&#39;t recall my mom asking if I&#39;d<br/>
like to do things with her. I think I remember asking if I could help cook<br/>
occasionally and she did show me then. But if she&#39;d asked, like she might<br/>
ask if I wanted to watch a TV show with her, it&#39;s communicating &quot;I enjoy<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sometimes there are honest to goodness practical reasons for doing things<br/>
certain ways! You should explain those!<br/>
<br/>
But too often the reasons for doing or not doing something is because it&#39;s<br/>
convenient or inconvenient for the parents. Parents will say they dont want<br/>
kids eating in front of the TV because they can&#39;t be trusted not to spill.<br/>
And that&#39;s -- well it&#39;s not trusting them for one thing ;-) -- and it&#39;s<br/>
putting stuff ahead of people. Much better to have a place where it doesn&#39;t<br/>
feel like a disaster if they do have an accident!<br/>
<br/>
Real flies and real ants -- not the fear that eating outside the kitchen<br/>
will draw ants because that&#39;s what our moms said -- are real reasons to keep<br/>
food in a particular place and keep the counters clean. Flies do carry<br/>
diseases.<br/>

across that it&#39;s just something we do in life. When they know what they&#39;re<br/>
supposed to do, and are just concentrating on other things, a single word<br/>
will help remind them. (How to Talk So Kids Will Listen has a lot of good<br/>
scenarios and ideas in it.) You can start picking things up and ask for<br/>
someone to pick up one part or ask someone to get a sponge. You&#39;ll<br/>
eventually get a feel for what you can suggest that is likely to feel to<br/>
them like helping you as opposed to you telling them what to do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-475566635">First off, Kelly, you seem to think you know me well enough to say <br/>
things like the below quote: <br/>
<br/>
&quot;*You* are already are feeling resentful for having to  clean up <br/>
after her---what are you modeling? Really?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Let me tell you, you don&#39;t and are very wrong.  <br/>
I never said I was resentful at all for having to pick up after my dd <br/>
or my family.  I was asking questions about how others handle these <br/>
situations.  I clean up after my whole family all the time with no <br/>
complaint.  DH and I usually do a deep clean on Saturday and the kids <br/>
just jump in and help because they want too.  No one forces them to <br/>
do anything.  They want to be part of the fun!  I don&#39;t even ask dh <br/>
to help, he too jumps in and helps because he wishes too.  :)  We <br/>
usually put on some music and dance, laugh and make merry all while <br/>
we put the house into a clean order again.  <br/>
<br/>
I do understand a youngin that has his own business, because my kids <br/>
are the same way.  See I have grown kids as well as teens in the <br/>
house too.  My 15 yr old ds raises and sells registered Netherland <br/>
Dwarf rabbits.  He also does small engine repair and is very into <br/>
racing.  Every venture he has decided to try or go into, he has <br/>
worked to finance himself, because he had the drive to do it.  He is <br/>
the one that loves animals so much that he keeps adding things to our <br/>
farm and he freely helps with all the farm chores.  (The girls help <br/>
too because they find it fun to feed the animals and help with their <br/>
care.  We all love animals!)  When my kids have a desire, they find a <br/>
way to fill that desire.  That is the fun of unschooling!  And the <br/>
freedom of it too.  :)  <br/>
 <br/>
&quot;I was mowing the grass earlier this week, thinking of this very  <br/>
situation. Our neighbors have a lawn care service that comes weekly. <br/>
He (the  lawn care guy) pointed out that didn&#39;t I have a teenage son <br/>
and why wasn&#39;t he mowing the lawn? I said I *liked* mowing the lawn.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Me too!   It is theraputic.  :)<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Many of Cameron&#39;s friends are forced to help around the house <br/>
because &quot;it&#39;s *their* house too and they need to take responsibility <br/>
of *their* house.&quot; At the same time, they told that they aren&#39;t <br/>
allowed to do such-and-such &quot;not while you&#39;re living under *MY* <br/>
roof.&quot;  Talk about mixed signals!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
No kidding!  I want my kids to take pride in the home they live in <br/>
and am always thankful when they choose to help keep it clean.  I can <br/>
say the only time I could see the words {&quot;not while you&#39;re living <br/>
under *MY* roof&quot;} used is if it were about using drugs or drinking <br/>
alcohol.  This is NOT a line I can ever see us using with our kids.<br/>
<br/>
As for the conference, finances would not allow any such luxury.  DH <br/>
only gets a small disability check monthly.  We also couldn&#39;t leave <br/>
the animals with no care, nor taking the time away from our kids. <br/>

<br/>
This is what I am talking about.  The child that didn&#39;t learn these <br/>
things and then are in the world with no skills and scared.  These <br/>
same kids ALWAYS say they wish they had been made to do it and learn.<br/>
<br/>
This happens even when a parent tries to show them how to so things <br/>
too!  My oldest was this way.  He wasn&#39;t made to do chores or <br/>
anything-it was all done for him, or it wasn&#39;t done at all because he <br/>
wouldn&#39;t do it!  I would mention from time to time that he would need <br/>
to know how to do this or that and if he wanted to know how, I would <br/>
show him.  Especially if I was heading off to do one of these &quot;jobs&quot; <br/>
like washing clothes.  Well, he never chose to learn and when he got <br/>
on his own, it was a shocker!  He had no clue and it was really scary <br/>
for him.  He too said to me that he wished I had taught him how to <br/>
do ---whatever--- and I laughed at him and told him that I tried and <br/>
he wasn&#39;t open to learning. lol!!!  <br/>
<br/>
This is just something that worries me.  Though it can happen whether <br/>
they are forced to learn it or not.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-231049164">I agree with Joyce here too.  There are just some situations that <br/>
have to be taken care of but for the right reasons.  Once kids know <br/>
and really understand why something has to be done or done a certain <br/>
way, they are glad to help.  They just need to know why.  <br/>
<br/>
We too have the farm set up and things that HAVE to be done.  The <br/>
kids all agreed to the farm and work that came with it before we went <br/>
on this adventure, so they knew they would have to help out.  Had <br/>
they not agreed, then we would not have proceeded with it.  As long <br/>
as I explain the &quot;whys&quot; we don&#39;t have any problems.  :)  I just <br/>
forget to do this in a rush sometimes, and then I only have me to <br/>
blame when something isn&#39;t done right and I have extra work to do <br/>
because of it.  lol!<br/>

<br/>
Too true.  The older kids were in the mid to late teens when we <br/>
started with farming.  They did have a good idea and we made sure <br/>
they REALLY understood what it meant.  Of course we are always open <br/>
and willing to make changes if something isn&#39;t working.  A family <br/>
talk around the dinner table usually gives us all time to talk <br/>
through what is needed.  We didn&#39;t want resentment nor did we want <br/>
animals suffering, so it tooks us awhile to get started.  :)<br/>
It has been so very worth it too!<br/>
<br/>
And you are right, pets and farm or any commitment like this fall in <br/>
the same catagory and should always been thought through completely.  <br/>
Ultimately, a venture should never be taken on unless the parent is <br/>
willing to take over, because kids loose interest real fast <br/>
sometimes.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-401329733"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; <br/>
&gt; I often think about this when the subject of cleaning up after <br/>
 </span></blockquote>oneself arises.  I have a friend, who was the youngest of 7 <br/>
children.  She wasn&#39;t expected to clean up after herself or help do <br/>
anything around the house.<br/>
<br/>
***** I was never required to do housework of any kind but my mom <br/>
kept the house clean, meals cooked, etc. In other words, she modeled <br/>
for me. When I left home, I learned how to keep my house clean and <br/>
cook because I wanted to eat well and live in a clean house.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; When she was 17, and had a job her mom would iron all of her <br/>
 </span></blockquote>clothes for her and make her lunch.<br/>
<br/>
***** Laurie is 24, and I iron for her and cook her meals. I also do <br/>
the majority of the housework. Up until last week, she was working <br/>
two jobs so it was more convenient for me. Now she&#39;s helping, in <br/>
this last month before she leaves for grad school. She&#39;s asked me to <br/>
help her put together a recipe book of household cleaners and her <br/>
favorite dishes. I hope she doesn&#39;t get the two mixed up &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;     I asked her what she thought about how she grew up and for her <br/>
 </span></blockquote>opinion on chores and such.  Her response kind of surprised me.  She <br/>
wished that her mom had made her do her own laundry and clean the <br/>
house.  She said that when she went to college out of state she was <br/>
terrified, because she didn&#39;t know how to do anything.  She used to <br/>
call her mom, crying because she felt so insecure.  Her mom always <br/>
did the cleaning and care of the house in front of her, but it was <br/>
up to my friend whether she wanted to participate or not. Most of <br/>
the time she chose not to, and in the end didn&#39;t pick up on how <br/>
things were done.<br/>
<br/>
***** I would say this was neglect on the teen&#39;s part. Surely she <br/>
realized she was about to be on her own and could have made the <br/>
decision to learn a few things before she left? <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;    I don&#39;t require that my kids do chores or pick up after <br/>
 </span></blockquote>themselves, but what happens when they are ready to move out.  Maybe <br/>
being homeschooled, which my friend was not, will make the <br/>
difference here.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; AnnMarie<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>****** Raised as a free child will make a difference, but it doesn&#39;t <br/>
necessarily mean they will keep a clean house. A clean house isn&#39;t <br/>
important to some people and sometimes we&#39;re just too busy to worry <br/>
about it. <br/>
