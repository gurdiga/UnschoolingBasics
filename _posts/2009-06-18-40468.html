<div id="ygrps-yiv-1788214190">Hello everyone!  I&#39;m a mother of two wonderful kids - son turning 7 this weekend and daughter, 9 going on 15.  We&#39;re kind sort of unschooling - did mostly unschooling the last school year but then I felt she was not challenging herself enough, her spelling became atrocious, handwriting was very bad, and I never let go completely of the math but didn&#39;t do much other than tell her I really wanted her to learn the times tables this year (she did - using a game).<br/>
<br/>
For the coming year, I&#39;m thinking of asking her to do 4 math problems a day just so she doesn&#39;t forget how to do basic subtraction and such. Also to write in a &quot;Friday Journal&quot; - kind of a photo album with narrative of what cool thing happened that week, so she can work a bit on her handwriting but also have a keepsake to treasure later. <br/>
<br/>
The problem is, she was in public school for awhile and really hated it; now she doesn&#39;t want to do much at all that smacks of school and I fear its keeping her from even learning naturally.  We&#39;re going into her third year of homeschooling, after 2 years of public school.  She actually didn&#39;t hate public school that much, but now she acts like it was the worst thing ever, and I wonder if she feels a little odd going against the current of what most kids are doing and is covering some defensiveness about it.  We had a couple of discussions about the pros and cons of homeschooling, but I&#39;m not militant about it.<br/>
<br/>
My son is taking to unschooling like a duck to water. He&#39;s way ahead in science (loves physics!) but a bit behind in reading and won&#39;t hold a pencil or write at all, tho he can sign his first name.  Part of the problem is big sister puts him down as being stupid whenever he can&#39;t perform as well as she does, so he doesn&#39;t even try.  We&#39;ve started doing &quot;Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons&quot; - half a lesson a night (they are pretty long!) and he&#39;s coming along.  He wants to do that, but won&#39;t do the writing parts.  He learned addition up to 10&#39;s on his own and likes to quiz me on math problems the say &quot;That&#39;s right!&quot; - LOL!</div>

Unschooling doesn&#39;t usually include curriculum and nightly lessons, or pressure to perform. It does include allowing your children to BE right where they are and trusting that they will learn.  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-62280253">Well, everyone I meet locally who says they unschool actually spend a great deal of time doing educational activities and they buy TONS of educational stuff - some to have around in case their kids want it but a lot of it because the parents hope their kids will do it.  They tell me they&#39;re unschooling and I think &quot;Wow, am I being lazy?  I mostly let the kids play and do things they want to do&quot;.  We do a lot together, too, but it&#39;s stuff they want to do.<br/>
<br/>
So on the spectrum for unschoolers, do you think this group represents the far extreme of unschooling or the typical unschooler, and maybe I&#39;ve only been meeting unschoolers who are on the &quot;schooling&quot; side of the spectrum?  (I do live in a high-achieving area.)<br/>
<br/>
Or did I maybe just confuse the group because I talked about the things I WAS doing educationally-wise rather than all the unschooling stuff we do?<br/>

That&#39;s a common reaction to school and school at home. When Ray left school, at 13, he spent a solid six months not wanting to learn about much other than computer games and tv shows. Now, almost three years later, he can&#39;t imagine a day without learning - but very little of it looks like school learning. <br/>
<br/>
Natural learning *doesn&#39;t* look like school learning for the most part. Its swirly and complex and goes off on tangents, sometimes never to return. It looks like play, and cuddling on the couch, and conversations at midnight. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-94842435">~~Or did I maybe just confuse the group because I talked about the things I WAS doing educationally-wise rather than all the unschooling stuff we do?~~<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But unschooling isn&#39;t &quot;stuff you do&quot;, it&#39;s a lifestyle. THere isn&#39;t unschooling stuff and educational stuff if you unschool. Unschooling is living life and trusting that learning happens ALL the time. You don&#39;t have to view things as &quot;educational&quot; or not...it&#39;s all just different kinds of things to learn about.<br/>
<br/>
The way Holt described unschooling was about trusting the natural learning process to unfold by simply being interested and curious in the world around us. It was about parents assisting their children with whatever they were into at the moment, rather than deciding what they want their children to be interested in. <br/>
<br/>
Doesn&#39;t mean parents don&#39;t swirl new ideas, activities etc... into the mix. Kids won&#39;t know what&#39;s out there unless you share, but unschooling is about trusting that your ideas, activities etc...aren&#39;t more important than something else they might be into. It&#39;s trusting that they are learning all the time. It&#39;s having FUN together and focusing on relationships not what is &quot;educational&quot; or not.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you know people who&#39;s children are simply into more formal kinds of learning, without any pressure from the adults and so you assumed that&#39;s what all unschoolers look like.:) Maybe you hang out with people who DO curriculum and call it unschooling. I don&#39;t know. To me, unschooling is NOT schooling. In any form unless the child chooses it. <br/>
<br/>
Every unschooling household looks completely different of course, so it&#39;s harder to say &quot;here&#39;s what it looks like&quot;. It looks different for every unique family that embraces it. But the ideas/philosophies remain the same....that humans learn best when they are free to explore anything and everything that interests them, all the time. Lessons and teaching run the risk of damaging that natural process.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, she wrote about a Mom offering allowance to a child and he calculated it all on his own. I&#39;m not reading what you&#39;re reading at ALL. One example at that page is about a kid being curious about the times tables and asking his Mum to show him (Sandra) and the other example is about a Mom offering to pay allowance each week and double it if she missed and the child started calculating it all on his own (Kate...who also admitted she&#39;d been worried previously and learned to let it go because of that incidence). In neither example was the parent making the child do anything.<br/>
<br/>
  ~~So what gives?  ARE You teaching or not?  Or are there some kinds of teaching that are unschooler &quot;cool&quot; and others that get you yelled at?  ~~<br/>
<br/>
Who&#39;s yelling? So far I&#39;ve seen some really nice posts giving good information.<br/>
<br/>
 ~~ Do you guys hang maps all over the walls, spend your free time reading books on math games to play with your kids to trick them into learning math, buy hundreds of dollars worth of stuff on foreign languages, etc. (not when they ask for it but &quot;just in case&quot;) and sign them up for the latest reading &quot;clubs&quot; etc.?~~<br/>
<br/>
None of the above. My children hang maps if they want to, or I&#39;ll hang one if I feel like it (but I&#39;m more inclined to hang art), we play games we like whether there is math in it or not (the idea is to have fun, not &quot;trick&quot; anyone, ever), I don&#39;t spend hundreds of dollars on any kind of program but I would on travel and my kids aren&#39;t members of any kind of clubs or programs, because they&#39;re not into that kind of thing right now. Could change tomorrow. <br/>
<br/>
~~I guess what I&#39;m afraid of is I&#39;ll be doing what I think is &quot;Unschooling&quot; and my kids won&#39;t know stuff they need and everyone else who is making these grand promises about how the kids learn naturally is actually spending tons of time doing educational stuff just making it fun and saying it&#39;s child-led, when really the parents are spending hours a week reading books on how to teach your kids stuff in the &quot;unschooling&quot; way - which is just another method of teaching if you&#39;re still trying to get them to do multiplication and such.  Ya know what I mean?~~<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Which is exactly why we don&#39;t do stuff in an &quot;unschooling way&quot;, we actually live a life free of schooling and coerced lessons. All the time. Day in and day out. Have for many, many years with a 19y.o., 15y.o., 12y.o. and 8y.o. that are learning just fine without all that and who can all (with the exception of the 8y.o.) read and spell without lessons.<br/>
<br/>
Your fears about unschooling are common though...many of us had to question and analyze the same things before we realized how we had the school blinders on!<br/>
<br/>
I believe that multiplication and reading and all of those things we consider &quot;basic&quot; skills are really EASY to learn. School makes you believe otherwise but if a skill is &quot;basic&quot; it means that it is common in a society. What a &quot;basic&quot; skill is to an American will not be the same for another culture. Basic means common. Common means that it surrounds us and is used often. If something is common and used often then people will pick it up with ease, by living in the society in which they are born.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~Because I see my kid backsliding to below what she knew in kindergarten in math and writing, but she can tell you all about teen sit-coms and pop music.~~<br/>
<br/>
She can learn all the math and writing she&#39;ll ever need in life through teen sit-coms and pop music. Whatever interest a person has includes math and reading and all sorts of &quot;basic&quot; skills. You&#39;re still valuing schoolish looking skills above other skills. <br/>
<br/>
There is no &quot;backsliding&quot; once you let go of comparing kids to other kids, which tells you nothing important.<br/>
<br/>
The skills that help me succeed in my career today are all about makeup and fashion and art and color. Do you believe you can guess what your child will end up pursuing passionately later in life? If so, prepare her for THAT. But good luck, because no human being can possibly guess what another human needs for next year or in five years, much less ten or more years down the line. <br/>
<br/>
The best preparation for a life well-lived (because that IS the ultimate goal, isn&#39;t it?) is to fill it with rich experiences and connections. Rich experiences don&#39;t come from one person extracting information or pushing another person to &quot;learn&quot;. Rich experiences come from standing side by side with someone and digging into something fun or fascinating or moving or beautiful. THAT&#39;S my goal as a parent...to make their days memorable. The learning happens as a side benefit. <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t take my word for it (even with four children who are up-ending all that mythology about teaching and school) because there are literally hundreds of unschoolers (many of whom I&#39;ve met and stayed with) who can tell you it works. But if you&#39;re looking for schoolish results, unschooling isn&#39;t the best path. If you&#39;re choosing to focus on living well and creating amazing memories instead of stressing about multiplication or reading, keep on reading.:)<br/>

&gt; timestables she talks about getting her kid to fill in a  <br/>
&gt; multiplication chart to get money he wanted.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It was an opportunity offered. It wasn&#39;t a do it or don&#39;t get the  <br/>
money deal. If they&#39;d said &quot;Ew,&quot; she would have dropped it.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s important to take away from that is that it was something that  <br/>
schooled kids more likely than not *would* say &quot;Ew,&quot; to but her kids  <br/>
didn&#39;t. *They* saw it as a cool puzzle to fill in.<br/>
<br/>
But for someone who is worried her kids won&#39;t learn the times table,  <br/>
it can fill their heads with worries that they aren&#39;t getting their  <br/>
kids to multiplication tables.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter Kat never did a table. The majority of her math knowledge  <br/>
came from living life and manipulating numbers to make them give her  <br/>
the information she wanted. She wanted to know how much more she  <br/>
needed to buy something. She wanted to know how long until. She  <br/>
wanted to beat the boss and needed more power. She wanted to shrink a  <br/>
picture to fit on the screen.<br/>
<br/>
Allowance. Video games. Questions. Art programs. Math comes up in  <br/>
life all the time. It&#39;s a tool to help us understand a situation  <br/>
better. When it&#39;s used for it&#39;s intended purpose then it goes in as  <br/>
painlessly and unconsciously as learning a native language.<br/>
<br/>
If you go to:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://joyfullyrejoycing.com">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com</a><br/>
<br/>
and scroll down the left side to the Math section, there are several  <br/>
pages about learning math.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you guys hang maps all over the walls,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We have maps though they didn&#39;t get used a lot. What&#39;s important was  <br/>
they were available and a part of my daughter&#39;s life.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; spend your free time reading books on math games to play with your  <br/>
&gt; kids to trick them into learning math,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ick. Math is part of life.<br/>
<br/>
Did you read books on language games to play with your kids to trick  <br/>
them into learning English?<br/>
<br/>
Or did you just use English and they used English and they got better  <br/>
at it as a side effect of using it as a tool to get what they wanted?<br/>
<br/>
Same thing works for math. And geography. And science.<br/>
<br/>
One caution, though. There should be bits of everything strewn about  <br/>
in their lives. *Not* to learn from. For them to have fun with. For  <br/>
them to explore if it looks interesting. For them to get a taste of  <br/>
something new.<br/>
<br/>
Your deal is to provide access to what they&#39;re interested in as well  <br/>
as things they might find interesting.<br/>
<br/>
*If* you&#39;ve been damaged by school, it might be hard to strew a video  <br/>
about the solar system because it will bring back bad memories of  <br/>
school. But unschooling kids worlds aren&#39;t divided into educational  <br/>
and fun the way ours were. They&#39;re divided into interested and not  <br/>
yet interested.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; buy hundreds of dollars worth of stuff on foreign languages, etc.  <br/>
&gt; (not when they ask for it but &quot;just in case&quot;) and sign them up for  <br/>
&gt; the latest reading &quot;clubs&quot; etc.?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do your kids want to do any of that stuff?<br/>
<br/>
Once you see enjoying what life has to offer instead of opportunities  <br/>
to learn, then you&#39;ll see how the question and answers could be  <br/>
misleading. I do have foreign language stuff because Kat was  <br/>
interested. We did one reading club but she thought the reward of  <br/>
pizza was bogus for something she was doing for fun.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of looking outward at what you can get into your kids, look  <br/>
inward at your kids. See what interests them and fascinates them and  <br/>
tickles them. Do more of that. Branch out from that to similar things  <br/>
you think they might like.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I guess what I&#39;m afraid of is I&#39;ll be doing what I think is  <br/>
&gt; &quot;Unschooling&quot; and my kids won&#39;t know stuff they need and everyone  <br/>
&gt; else who is making these grand promises about how the kids learn  <br/>
&gt; naturally is actually spending tons of time doing educational stuff<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think the sticking point for many is that people think unschooling  <br/>
is doing the opposite of making kids learn. If you take away making  <br/>
them, what do you have left? Not make them. So they let their kids go  <br/>
and do what they want.<br/>
<br/>
Certainly part of unschooling is giving children the freedom to  <br/>
explore. Don&#39;t interfere when they&#39;re happily engaged! But an equally  <br/>
important part of unschooling is having swirly lives where they&#39;re  <br/>
exposed to new fun things in the house and out of the house.<br/>
<br/>
Once you stop trying to get stuff in and  help them pull in what  <br/>
they&#39;re reaching for and giving them access to more things they could  <br/>
reach for, unschooling will go a lot smoother.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Because I see my kid backsliding to below what she knew in  <br/>
&gt; kindergarten in math and writing, but she can tell you all about  <br/>
&gt; teen sit-coms and pop music.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It could be she never learned it. What she did was learn to spit back  <br/>
something for tests without truly understanding.<br/>
<br/>
It could be she&#39;s protecting herself from activities that bring back  <br/>
bad memories of drudgery and wrong answers and forced learning.<br/>
<br/>
She will recover. Math is a useful tool. For now, you do the math for  <br/>
her, sweetly, kindly, gently. Treat it like a broken leg that needs  <br/>
healed. Provide positive associations with math. If you feel  <br/>
negativity rising around her, let it go. Accept that she&#39;s still  <br/>
recovering.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1723105581">OK that makes total sense.  Thank you.  And I see what you mean.  <br/>
<br/>
Right now she&#39;s transitioning from &quot;I&#39;m going to be a pop star&quot; which frustrated me because the lessons were expensive and she never did her practice the music teacher gave her so didn&#39;t really progress much (except maybe to learning that being a pop star is more work than she wants to do!) to being obsessed with Taekwondo - she bought 9 books on it at a local thrift store and read one on the way home and has lessons 4 times a week.  I doubt her interest will stay with taekwondo for long because so far she changes obsessions about once a year, but if it did &quot;stick&quot; she could open a school like her teacher is doing now, and what she&#39;d need to know would be the taekwondo stuff, with hardly any &quot;science&quot; or &quot;math&quot; other than what she&#39;d be using.  And she&#39;ll always know she can break a board, flip a grown-up and be fierce.  That&#39;s pretty cool stuff.<br/>
<br/>
So you&#39;re the &quot;normal&quot; for homeschooling then?  Because I do read Holt but the books by him I pick up are all about how to use life to teach kids stuff, and the emphasis is on teaching.  I feel sneaky getting a board game on the states or presidents and pretending I want to play it because it will be &quot;fun&quot; to get them to learn that stuff.  I&#39;d rather be honest and just tell them I&#39;d like them to know whatever because it&#39;s useful.  <br/>
<br/>
You and Faith and some others say even that isn&#39;t unschooling, so is there a name for the people who bend over backwards to find and do all the &quot;fun&quot; educational stuff, where the goal is still making sure their kids are learning stuff?  Would that be relaxed homeschooling (I don&#39;t see how it can be relaxed when the parents have to put so much work into it!)? I&#39;m not usually into labels but for the sake of this conversation it seems like it would be very useful to be able to differentiate.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking about this last night after my post (I hope I didn&#39;t sound mean, I&#39;m just frustrated at trying to figure this out).  I really feel that I don&#39;t have a choice in the matter.  I can see that trying to force learning on an unwilling pupil isn&#39;t going to work nor will it stick.  Also I&#39;m too honest with my kids to be getting up hours earlier in the morning to find &quot;fun&quot; activities that will reinforce their math skills or get them to learn something.  The traits I want for them the most are for them to be able to know themselves, know what they want, and live a full life, with many and varied interests.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Yeah, ok but here&#39;s what I don&#39;t get.  In <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/timestables">http://sandradodd.com/timestables</a> she talks about getting her kid to fill in a multiplication chart to get money he wanted.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; No, she wrote about a Mom offering allowance to a child and he calculated it all on his own. I&#39;m not reading what you&#39;re reading at ALL. One example at that page is about a kid being curious about the times tables and asking his Mum to show him (Sandra) and the other example is about a Mom offering to pay allowance each week and double it if she missed and the child started calculating it all on his own (Kate...who also admitted she&#39;d been worried previously and learned to let it go because of that incidence). In neither example was the parent making the child do anything.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   ~~So what gives?  ARE You teaching or not?  Or are there some kinds of teaching that are unschooler &quot;cool&quot; and others that get you yelled at?  ~~<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Who&#39;s yelling? So far I&#39;ve seen some really nice posts giving good information.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  ~~ Do you guys hang maps all over the walls, spend your free time reading books on math games to play with your kids to trick them into learning math, buy hundreds of dollars worth of stuff on foreign languages, etc. (not when they ask for it but &quot;just in case&quot;) and sign them up for the latest reading &quot;clubs&quot; etc.?~~<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; None of the above. My children hang maps if they want to, or I&#39;ll hang one if I feel like it (but I&#39;m more inclined to hang art), we play games we like whether there is math in it or not (the idea is to have fun, not &quot;trick&quot; anyone, ever), I don&#39;t spend hundreds of dollars on any kind of program but I would on travel and my kids aren&#39;t members of any kind of clubs or programs, because they&#39;re not into that kind of thing right now. Could change tomorrow. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ~~I guess what I&#39;m afraid of is I&#39;ll be doing what I think is &quot;Unschooling&quot; and my kids won&#39;t know stuff they need and everyone else who is making these grand promises about how the kids learn naturally is actually spending tons of time doing educational stuff just making it fun and saying it&#39;s child-led, when really the parents are spending hours a week reading books on how to teach your kids stuff in the &quot;unschooling&quot; way - which is just another method of teaching if you&#39;re still trying to get them to do multiplication and such.  Ya know what I mean?~~<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Which is exactly why we don&#39;t do stuff in an &quot;unschooling way&quot;, we actually live a life free of schooling and coerced lessons. All the time. Day in and day out. Have for many, many years with a 19y.o., 15y.o., 12y.o. and 8y.o. that are learning just fine without all that and who can all (with the exception of the 8y.o.) read and spell without lessons.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Your fears about unschooling are common though...many of us had to question and analyze the same things before we realized how we had the school blinders on!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I believe that multiplication and reading and all of those things we consider &quot;basic&quot; skills are really EASY to learn. School makes you believe otherwise but if a skill is &quot;basic&quot; it means that it is common in a society. What a &quot;basic&quot; skill is to an American will not be the same for another culture. Basic means common. Common means that it surrounds us and is used often. If something is common and used often then people will pick it up with ease, by living in the society in which they are born.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ~~Because I see my kid backsliding to below what she knew in kindergarten in math and writing, but she can tell you all about teen sit-coms and pop music.~~<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She can learn all the math and writing she&#39;ll ever need in life through teen sit-coms and pop music. Whatever interest a person has includes math and reading and all sorts of &quot;basic&quot; skills. You&#39;re still valuing schoolish looking skills above other skills. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There is no &quot;backsliding&quot; once you let go of comparing kids to other kids, which tells you nothing important.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The skills that help me succeed in my career today are all about makeup and fashion and art and color. Do you believe you can guess what your child will end up pursuing passionately later in life? If so, prepare her for THAT. But good luck, because no human being can possibly guess what another human needs for next year or in five years, much less ten or more years down the line. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The best preparation for a life well-lived (because that IS the ultimate goal, isn&#39;t it?) is to fill it with rich experiences and connections. Rich experiences don&#39;t come from one person extracting information or pushing another person to &quot;learn&quot;. Rich experiences come from standing side by side with someone and digging into something fun or fascinating or moving or beautiful. THAT&#39;S my goal as a parent...to make their days memorable. The learning happens as a side benefit. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t take my word for it (even with four children who are up-ending all that mythology about teaching and school) because there are literally hundreds of unschoolers (many of whom I&#39;ve met and stayed with) who can tell you it works. But if you&#39;re looking for schoolish results, unschooling isn&#39;t the best path. If you&#39;re choosing to focus on living well and creating amazing memories instead of stressing about multiplication or reading, keep on reading.:)<br/>

In a similar way one might offer a calculator.  There was no force or coercion.  The chart could have been stopped as easy as it was started.  The kids were learning, but no one was teaching.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>******Well, I can only speak for me.  We have a human body poster in the bathroom hanging over the toilet.  This gets a LOT of use with 3 boys standing several times a day.  They REALLY like it.  One thing I have is a giant white board in the dining room.  I have the alphabet and numbers on it.  I also have there bank account registers written on it.  Milo is 4, he really likes to write and type but often forgets letters so it&#39;s easy for me to point to the letter he needs.  I can also write out sentences he wants to type out instead of spelling them one letter at a time.  We also write plans on it.  That has more to do with my goldfish like memory though.  Otherwise my house looks like any other house.  Just messier since there&#39;s a lot of action going on day to day<br/>
<br/>
If the kids are interested in joining a club... then they do.  I imagine one of my children will like a book club  But right now, none of them enjoy books much at all.  Except Phoenix.  He&#39;s one.  He likes to rip them, a lot.  &lt;G&gt;<br/>

and the lessons are their practice. Let the lessons be for them to  <br/>
get out of it what they want rather than for you to get them where  <br/>
you think the lessons could take them.<br/>
<br/>
They *are* learning but not just what they&#39;re supposed to learn.  <br/>
They&#39;re learning more about themselves and teaching styles and what  <br/>
they enjoy and what feels right to them.<br/>

practice easier but let her own the experience.<br/>

What if they are a bit intrigued by the states and presidents and you  <br/>

<br/>
What if they wanted to explore Pokemon but you couldn&#39;t muster the  <br/>
excitement for the game?<br/>

Unschooling isn&#39;t for you! It&#39;s for them :-) (Though lots of parents  <br/>
find they benefit greatly as a side effect of unschooling!)<br/>
<br/>
That said, most educational games felt false to me so we didn&#39;t play  <br/>
them much. But she learned anyway. And not even because I said it  <br/>
would be useful to know. She learned because the information is in  <br/>
her life and it&#39;s already inherently useful!<br/>
<br/>
States and presidents will come up in a rich life because they&#39;re  <br/>
part of life. You don&#39;t need to go specifically looking for presidents.<br/>
<br/>
But it helps to let go of the fear that such things are boring.  <br/>
School may have made them boring for you. It could be they&#39;re not an  <br/>
interest for your kids right now. But it won&#39;t hurt to strew funny  <br/>
books about the presidents in the bathroom. It won&#39;t hurt to show  <br/>
them episodes of Histeria! because they&#39;re funny not because they&#39;re  <br/>
about history.<br/>

about games and fun ways to be educational. It&#39;s about finding ways  <br/>
to do the subjects in ways the kids enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
In my early years playing around with homeschooling ways, yes, I  <br/>
found all those ways a *lot* of work. Work to find things. Work to  <br/>
get her engaged. Disappointment when she turned her nose up at  <br/>
something I&#39;d put time and money and effort into. There was nothing  <br/>
relaxing about it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1411037929">I find there is a lot of variety here locally too amongst people who <br/>
call themselves unschoolers. I am involved in organizing local <br/>
unschooling get togethers and have had lot of people showing up saying <br/>
they unschool with quite a variety of approaches. Most of them seem to <br/>
lead to disappointment and burnout.<br/>
<br/>
I used to buy more &quot;educational&quot; stuff - some of it was okay but a lot <br/>
was ignored so I learned.  I now look for fun and interesting stuff and <br/>
experiences that might interest my kids to offer(though often now they <br/>
are the ones finding them on their own), and only think about what <br/>
category it might fit into after I sit down to write our reports for the <br/>
state. My son fairly recently came to me with a list of 20 things he <br/>
wanted to do and/or get. We have followed through on about half so far, <br/>
and some he isn&#39;t interested in anymore - a midi keyboard(played a lot <br/>
for awhile, has set it aside for now), visiting a martial arts <br/>
class(decided not to sign up), mountain bike(he rides daily), Get a <br/>
job(he starts next week), and many other things. He paid for the <br/>
keyboard and bike mostly on his own.<br/>
<br/>
You can be any kind of homeschooler and call yourself an unschooler and <br/>
obviously no one can stop you - but I suggest giving the parents on this <br/>
list more than one chance, as they are pretty darn smart, and if you <br/>
consider their advice your life just might become about 1000 times <br/>
better!! And your kids happy and learning more deeply. And your <br/>
relationships with your kids will improve beyond recognition.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; So on the spectrum for unschoolers, do you think this group represents <br/>
&gt; the far extreme of unschooling or the typical unschooler, and maybe <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve only been meeting unschoolers who are on the &quot;schooling&quot; side of <br/>
&gt; the spectrum? (I do live in a high-achieving area.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1389785999">LOL! Oh, this too funny. <br/>
Yes, we have meetings and try to figure out how to trick new unschoolers into keeping their children ignorant.  :)<br/>
Yes, there were maps on the wall here. Yes, there was also a map of the US with the electoral college numbers. A timeline of the Presidents. And a poster of a local sunken ship. And all kinds of art work from DD. And even a times tables poster. What else? Oh, pretty much picture all the walls covered with stuff a decorator would never choose. :)<br/>
But it was all put there as things came up.  Elections or news or interests or questions.<br/>
Here&#39;s another story for you. <br/>
DD is the younger of my two children. DS read independently before her and by the time DD was almost-6, she was bitter!!! She marched up to me one day and announced: &quot;Everyone in the world can read except me. I want to know how to read now!&quot; <br/>
Oh. I was basically stunned. I thought she was reading just fine. Beginning to pick out words, etc. But she was not satisfied! She wanted a textbook and that was final! So we went online and looked at a number of choices. You know there are a ton. And we ended up buying your choice -- 100 easy lessons. <br/>
Turns out she didn&#39;t need the first third of the book because she already read some. She did the middle third and then could read on her own. Which was the point, it turned out. And so we never did the last third but she has pretty much lived at the library ever since. :)<br/>
But do you see the difference? I didn&#39;t suggest that textbook or any textbook. I didn&#39;t schedule the times she would do the reading in the textbook. I didn&#39;t say how much of it she should do or that she needed to finish it.<br/>
She had a need and I tried to help her reach her goal. And she did. <br/>
Every map and poster and activity and thing that might look schoolish from the outside has a similar story behind it here. <br/>
Except for poor DS. He had to endure my learning curve early on -- I searched through our state&#39;s standards and made flash cards and all kinds of nonsense for about the first 6 months of our hsing. Shudder! :)<br/>
But he survived and both he and DD are wonderful teens now.  DD has finished the online courses she chose to do the past couple of years and has decided she wants to go to the public high school next fall. (DH is not thrilled but we are trying to be supportive.) DS has his own interests -- reads online incessantly, all sorts of things, games and works out and eats (I&#39;m thinking his Tae Kwon Do coach should subsidize his food bill :) ). He has no interest in institutional schooling.<br/>
I think they are both at a wonderful age! They don&#39;t need to have anything figured out  (although DD is a planner) and they are enjoying themselves with their chosen interests and friends and are growing and learning. But not because I insisted on any of it. I think they are happy and positive kids (but don&#39;t get DS started on politics -- we have raised a skeptic, if not a cynic . . . ) because they are given the time to figure themselves out and didn&#39;t, and still don&#39;t, have my agenda imposed on them. Or the neighbors&#39;.<br/>
Unschooling is about letting go of a lot of the worries about keeping up and being in step with all the other kids and families. It&#39;s about a lot of things. And it&#39;s not for everyone. But if anecdotes help, take mine and add them to the pile. :)<br/>
Nance<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I&#39;m afraid of is I&#39;ll be doing what I think is &quot;Unschooling&quot; and my kids won&#39;t know stuff they need and everyone else who is making these grand promises about how the kids learn naturally is actually spending tons of time doing educational stuff just making it fun and saying it&#39;s child-led, when really the parents are spending hours a week reading books on how to teach your kids stuff in the &quot;unschooling&quot; way - which is just another method of teaching if you&#39;re still trying to get them to do multiplication and such. Ya know what I mean? Because I see my kid backsliding to below what she knew in kindergarten in math and writing, but she can tell you all about teen sit-coms and pop music.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1593147944">I saw my name mentioned as I was perusing this thread so i felt like I<br/>
should get on a real computer and add my two cents.<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
OP: Right now she&#39;s transitioning from &quot;I&#39;m going to be a pop star&quot; which<br/>
frustrated me because the lessons were expensive and she never did her<br/>
practice the music teacher gave her so didn&#39;t really progress much (except<br/>
maybe to learning that being a pop star is more work than she wants to do!)<br/>
to being obsessed with Taekwondo - she bought 9 books on it at a local<br/>
thrift store and read one on the way home and has lessons 4 times a week. I<br/>
doubt her interest will stay with taekwondo for long because so far she<br/>
changes obsessions about once a year, but if it did &quot;stick&quot; she could open a<br/>
school like her teacher is doing now, and what she&#39;d need to know would be<br/>
the taekwondo stuff, with hardly any &quot;science&quot; or &quot;math&quot; other than what<br/>
she&#39;d be using. And she&#39;ll always know she can break a board, flip a<br/>
grown-up and be fierce. That&#39;s pretty cool stuff.<br/>
<br/>
*** Did she enjoy the pop star classes? Learning that being a pop star is<br/>
more work than she wanted to put in (at this point in her life) is a really<br/>
important thing. I am not sure how old your child/ren is/are but a year is a<br/>
pretty long time to hang on to a passion. My kids change passions<br/>
frequently. Some last longer than others (gymnastic, theater, Pokemon) and<br/>
Others are short lived (horseback riding, webkinz, baseball). Sometimes my<br/>
kids think they would like to try some and are uber excited but then when<br/>
they try it it doesn&#39;t float their boat. That happens to me as well. I have<br/>
had passions that lasted for years (midwifery) and things that I have been<br/>
passionate for a short time (cooking) and otehr things I tried and didn&#39;t<br/>
like. If you look for the positive you will find something cool in<br/>
everything your kids do.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;with hardly any &quot;science&quot; or &quot;math&quot; other than what she&#39;d be using. &quot; I am<br/>
unsure what you mean. Why would she need science or math that she wouldn&#39;t<br/>
be using?<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
OP: So you&#39;re the &quot;normal&quot; for homeschooling then? Because I do read Holt<br/>
but the books by him I pick up are all about how to use life to teach kids<br/>
stuff, and the emphasis is on teaching. I feel sneaky getting a board game<br/>
on the states or presidents and pretending I want to play it because it will<br/>
be &quot;fun&quot; to get them to learn that stuff. I&#39;d rather be honest and just tell<br/>
them I&#39;d like them to know whatever because it&#39;s useful.<br/>
<br/>
*** I believe you were already direct to Holt&#39;s chornological bibilography.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t get out board games (or anything) with a goal besides having fun in<br/>
mind. We play bananagrams because its fun not because I want them to spell<br/>
better or work on logica problems. We paly video games for pure joy rather<br/>
than with an agenda. Sure they learn alot from them but that&#39;s not *why* we<br/>
do them. Right now my son is playing a lot of Saint&#39;s Row2. He loves to work<br/>
in the chop shop fixing the cars up. He is learning about color scheme,<br/>
purchasing, loigcal problem solving and many other things. Math, map skills,<br/>
eye to hand condination, reading and word recognition, etc. But I don&#39;t<br/>
discuss those things with him, he just has fun.<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
OP: You and Faith and some others say even that isn&#39;t unschooling, so is<br/>
there a name for the people who bend over backwards to find and do all the<br/>
&quot;fun&quot; educational stuff, where the goal is still making sure their kids are<br/>
learning stuff? Would that be relaxed homeschooling (I don&#39;t see how it can<br/>
be relaxed when the parents have to put so much work into it!)? I&#39;m not<br/>
usually into labels but for the sake of this conversation it seems like it<br/>
would be very useful to be able to differentiate.<br/>
<br/>
***I am glad I said that because it isn&#39;t. That is sneaky and I don&#39;t think<br/>
that deception brings families closer. If your goal is to have your child<br/>
learn X, Y, Z then do what you need to do to get there. But it your goal is<br/>
to unschool and be respectful and loving family then coercion, deception and<br/>
force isn&#39;t goign to work well. I bend over backwards to bring the things<br/>
that bring joy into my childrens lives. This is their life, the one chance<br/>
they have to have a happy childhood.<br/>
<br/>
I am looking around in my oldest (12) daughter&#39;s room (I am using her<br/>
computer). I look at what she has in her space. It looks like a fairly<br/>
typical kids room, bed, dresser, shelves and a desk. She has a computer,<br/>
printer and a web cam. She hasinternet acess and frequently uses facebook,<br/>
Gaia, skype and a few other sites. She has books, both fiction and<br/>
non-fiction. Predominately fiction. She has shelves of special things. She<br/>
has posters she&#39;s made up on her walls. You wouldn&#39;t know if she went to<br/>
school or homeschooled or unschooled by her room. It isn&#39;t about how it<br/>
looks, its about how I relate to her about her stuff. I don&#39;t limit her<br/>
internet acess or computer usage. She is on there a lot. She is a writer and<br/>
works on her novel for several hours daily (on and off). I am there to hel<br/>
if she has questions about anything. I don&#39;t require her to use her things<br/>
in any certain way. She has no required reading yet reads frequently and<br/>
enjoys it. We have a closet downstairs that contains board games, dvds,<br/>
video games and such. She is free to pick and chose from any or none. If she<br/>
wants to play a gmae I am there to play one with her. If I want to play a<br/>
gmae I migth ask her to join me if she wants, no agenda just fun.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard for many people to do but take school out of the equation. There<br/>
is no body of knowledge that everyone *HAS* to have. S/he is not behind,<br/>
s/he is absolute exactly where s/he needs to be right now.<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking about this last night after my post (I hope I didn&#39;t sound<br/>
mean, I&#39;m just frustrated at trying to figure this out). I really feel that<br/>
I don&#39;t have a choice in the matter. I can see that trying to force learning<br/>
on an unwilling pupil isn&#39;t going to work nor will it stick. Also I&#39;m too<br/>
honest with my kids to be getting up hours earlier in the morning to find<br/>
&quot;fun&quot; activities that will reinforce their math skills or get them to learn<br/>
something. The traits I want for them the most are for them to be able to<br/>
know themselves, know what they want, and live a full life, with many and<br/>
varied interests.<br/>
<br/>
*** Great, I am gald you are honest with your kids, that&#39;s a great start.<br/>
Instead of thinging in terms of what *you* want for htem, figure out who<br/>
they are and how you can embrace that, right now at this moment. Are you who<br/>
you were 5 years ago, 10 years ago, when you were 12? let them be themselves<br/>
with no agenda to develope into anything or anyone except themselves.<br/>
<br/>
What are math skills? Are they seperate from life?<br/>
<br/>
Here is my take on this: If somthing is so important that your child has to<br/>
know it for life then life will give opportunities to learn it. If life<br/>
isn&#39;t providing opportunities then perhaps it isn&#39;t as important as you<br/>
think.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1789734346">OP: Yeah, ok but here&#39;s what I don&#39;t get. In<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/timestables">http://sandradodd.com/timestables</a> she talks about getting her kid to fill in<br/>
a multiplication chart to get money he wanted. So what gives? ARE You<br/>
teaching or not? Or are there some kinds of teaching that are unschooler<br/>
&quot;cool&quot; and others that get you yelled at?<br/>
<br/>
**I think you got several really great answers about this one. Learning an<br/>
teaching are two different things.<br/>
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
OP: Do you guys hang maps all over the walls, spend your free time reading<br/>
books on math games to play with your kids to trick them into learning math,<br/>
buy hundreds of dollars worth of stuff on foreign languages, etc. (not when<br/>
they ask for it but &quot;just in case&quot;) and sign them up for the latest reading<br/>
&quot;clubs&quot; etc.?<br/>
<br/>
****I put things up on our walls that inspire me. That sometimes includes<br/>
maps, I love maps. My kids put there own things up on the walls that<br/>
inspired them or bring them joy.<br/>
<br/>
I have never tricked my kids into &quot;learning&quot; anything. I have paid attention<br/>
to them and their needs/wants/desires and facilitated learning<br/>
opportunities. I did this not because I want my children to learn so much as<br/>
I want my children to have a rich full enjoyable life. Learning is a<br/>
byproduct of a life well lived.<br/>
<br/>
Reading clubs may be something your kids love, mine don&#39;t really. The oldest<br/>
loves to be part of reading discussion groups so I have made that possible.<br/>
But the carrot on a stick reading enticements don&#39;t interest any of them. We<br/>
went to Borders the other day to buy me a book (LOL). We ended up coming<br/>
home with 3 books, 2 for my son and one for the family. My son (6) choose<br/>
his books, The Zombie Survival Guide and book 2 of the 39 Clues series. He<br/>
hasn&#39;t touch either yet. He might not ever read them (though I think he<br/>
will) but I support his interest in getting those specific books. We also<br/>
picked up a Ripley&#39;s Believe it or Not book. Everyone in our family loves<br/>
those. I am sure we will learn stuff from them but that isn&#39;t why I bought<br/>
them. Does that make sense?<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I&#39;m afraid of is I&#39;ll be doing what I think is &quot;Unschooling&quot;<br/>

a kid is schooled or not. A schooled kid may be able to spit out some<br/>

I just want to second this advice. I think new folks should do whatever they can to make it out to a conference where they can sit with circles of parents that can share their fears, concerns, joys and experiences. There is nothing like that face-to-face support.<br/>

You need to go back and read all the posts in order.<br/>
The OP asked:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;So what gives? ARE You teaching or not? Or are there some kinds of teaching that<br/>
are unschooler &quot;cool&quot; and others that get you yelled at?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
No one had used any caps in any answer prior to that. The OP , like me, used caps  ( no bold caps used)to enfasize words.<br/>
<br/>
NO ( me not screaming ) one had &quot;screamed at her, literally or by using bold caps.<br/>
By the way I did not use &quot;bold&quot; caps. Just caps.....<br/>
But anyways.....back to unschooling ( bold but not caps).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-240139181">You are right that no one used &quot;bold&quot;.<br/>
I did read the posts in order.<br/>
It is supremely funny that you and the OP were writing  about not yelling while yelling: &quot;WHO is yelling at you??????&quot; <br/>
:)<br/>
Whether someone &quot;used&quot; all caps to yell is not the point. <br/>

You need to go back and read all the posts in order.<br/>
The OP asked:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;So what gives? ARE You teaching or not? Or are there some kinds of teaching that<br/>
are unschooler &quot;cool&quot; and others that get you yelled at?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
No one had used any caps in any answer prior to that. The OP , like me, used caps  ( no bold caps used)to enfasize words.<br/>
<br/>
NO ( me not screaming ) one had &quot;screamed at her, literally or by using bold caps.<br/>
By the way I did not use &quot;bold&quot; caps. Just caps.....<br/>
But anyways..... back to unschooling ( bold but not caps).<br/>

<br/>
That would not be considered &quot;yelling&quot; online. That is emphasizing one word.<br/>
<br/>
~~Whether someone &quot;used&quot; all caps to yell is not the point.~~<br/>
<br/>
Then what was your point? You gave everyone a &quot;lesson&quot; on the use of bold when nobody needed it. I&#39;m not sure what the point is here. Let&#39;s stick to discussing unschooling.<br/>
