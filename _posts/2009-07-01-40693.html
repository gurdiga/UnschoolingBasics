<div id="ygrps-yiv-1967817441">Hi Meredith,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Angela. I am mother to three -- 7YO ds, and 4YO and 20mo dds -- and we are in the process of figuring out what do for my son, specifically, and the whole family ultimately, so I&#39;ve been lurking here for a few months.<br/>
<br/>
You are always so thoughtful with your responses and generous with your time considering and responding to everyone else&#39;s posts. I look forward to hearing your point of view on topics I am following, and will read your posts if I see your name on a thread I otherwise might pass by. I read your responses and think &quot;we can do this.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So, just thought I&#39;d send out a thank you.<br/>
Best,<br/>
Angela Wolff<br/>
West Orange, NJ<br/>

I agree and this is a great time for me to go ahead and let you all know that Meredith is our new moderator.<br/>
I have long enjoyed her mindful, well-written responses and thought that she would be a great addition here, since our moderators (and our other owner) are mostly absent these days.:)<br/>
<br/>
I need to cut back even further on my internet time too, so the list will be in good hands with Meredith looking out for it. I&#39;m really grateful for her time and energy here. Thank you Meredith!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-819784529">Shout out to West Orange, NJ! I grew up not far from there (near<br/>
intersection of 80 and 287) and had relatives that lived in that area at<br/>
various times.<br/>
