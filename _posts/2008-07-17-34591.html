<div id="ygrps-yiv-632234837">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to say &quot;Hi&quot; as a new member of the group. I am teaching my<br/>
little girl at home - she&#39;s 5 years old - and am coming to the realization<br/>
that what we have been doing - and the only thing that works with her - is<br/>
basically unschooling. I&#39;m looking forward to learning from those<br/>
experienced in unschooling and gaining a sense of community rather than<br/>
feeling isolated. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for letting me learn along with everyone else.<br/>
