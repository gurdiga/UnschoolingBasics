  I don&#39;t post as much as I&#39;d like to, but I&#39;m always reading the posts, and challenging my own assumptions about being a parent and an adult.  <br/>
  I just wanted to share with you all something that I wrote on my blog.  A lot has clicked for me lately, living with my mother and sister in law....they are not child friendly AT ALL.  They are down right abusive.  And if there was anyplace else for us to stay we would have been there already.  So we&#39;ve decided to send Safiya and Dakari to stay with my mom in NYC for a few weeks.  She&#39;s wanted them to come and visit and my children love her sooo much (she&#39;s the &#39;good&#39; grandma).  Rohana, who gets the totality of the bad treatment from my inlaws, will go and stay with a friend of hers.  Jabari, the two young ones, and I will remain at my  inlaws.  Once again, our family will be split up....but not for long.  I&#39;m sure having 3 of my children away from me willl make me REALLY appreciate them all when we are together again.  Anyway.....here&#39;s my &quot;rant&quot; from my blog.  I hope it helps those of you who are teetering on the fence of ru, cl, and any other letters of the alphabet<br/>
 that are shorthand for living joyfully and in freedom (thanks Ren and Joyce) with your children:<br/>
  &quot;I&#39;m so anxious to learn more about living joyfully and parenting unconditionally.....this living situation is definitely testing the boundaries of my patience, and I feel like I&#39;m failing miserably. My children....I love them more now than I did yesterday. Little pieces of the Universe in my care.....they are so special, so pure....and their souls have entrusted me to guide them through this life. I will not let them down. I will do what is necessary. I will sacrifice and die &#39;unto myself&#39; that they will live and have life. Isn&#39;t that the message of all organized religions? I digress.....my children mean more to me than my own life. And I firmly believe that living consensually and joyfully and radically unschooling is the path for us - there&#39;s no doubt in my mind....I have been convinced - I am a convert. Now comes the hard part....putting into practice the ideals that I hold so highly now. Catching myself at my weak moments. Delving into my own soul to dig up my dirt,<br/>
 hold it up to the light and analyze it. I have to if I&#39;m to move forward, and allow my children to be who they are to be. I love them more than my hurt and pain. I love them more than my desire to look like a &quot;good mother&quot; in others eyes. I love them more than my shortcomings. And I will grow in this path.&quot;<br/>

Thanks Ren - you are definitely a big inspiration for me; especially since you have four children - LOL.<br/>
  Here&#39;s a question for you and the others......how do you get past the guilt?  Once you learn about ru, and get those AHA moments, after that comes &quot;oh gosh!  I can&#39;t believe I used to do XYZ!!!&quot;  I&#39;m reading Unconditional Parenting and....I admit...I&#39;ve done the Love Withdrawl method.  I&#39;ve even gotten pissed off and started to walk away from my children while they were crying, only for them to cry even more, screaming &quot;mommy, wait!&quot;  That only aggravated more - how sad!  <br/>
  Now I look back and I&#39;m so ashamed, and feel so sad that I would make one of my children feel that way.  Some days I think &quot;gosh, I wish I knew about this stuff when I first met my gift daughter.  I would have unschooled her from the start, and then my other four would have just joined us on that journey.  I&#39;m encouraged by Ren who talks about how she parented her older two vs. her younger two, and then I have faith that the older ones will be okay.Do any of you have those days?  How do you get past that guilt of what you used to do in the past?  <br/>

  Awww....thanks Tricia!  Like you I&#39;m always reading.  I&#39;m always at someone&#39;s blog, looking to learn more.<br/>
  I realized something....I&#39;m sooo schooled!  I&#39;ve been programmed to do things FAST because in school the faster you did something showed how &quot;smart&quot; you were.  It&#39;s like I&#39;m still trying to beat the clock, ya know?  Everything is a race.  At least I&#39;ve gotten rid of my desire to have things done in a &quot;certain way&quot;.  Well....mostly.<br/>
  And going along with doing a good job.....Khalid left the house in his pajamas today.  A definite no-no in my mom&#39;s book of good mommyhood - LOL.  And all of the kids have worn the same outfit about twice in a row - hey, laundry takes a backseat to library hopping and hanging out with friends. &lt;g&gt;   <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maisha this is my current experience.  My current thoughts about<br/>
unschooling and parenting my children with more freedom and choices are<br/>
thoughts I wish I had always exhibited.  I know for now this is &quot;the<br/>
real me&quot;, and &quot;coming into my own&quot;, as it felt like coming HOME when the<br/>
light came on.<br/>
<br/>
My children are still youngish and they are very forgiving, thank<br/>
Goodness.  It&#39;s nice to get a second chance... but the thought that at<br/>
times I&#39;d be harsh and hard on them for things that really were not<br/>
worth all that, It makes me shudder to think I used to BE like that.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m the kind of person who, when I change, I don&#39;t do &quot;baby steps&quot; I<br/>
jump into it with my whole heart and soul, because I either believe in<br/>
something or I don&#39;t.  The children are getting used to the &quot;new me&quot;,<br/>
and embracing our life together with love.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot change the past.  My children know, due to me being honest with<br/>
them (I showed my oldest daughter &quot;Parenting from the Heart&quot; by Jan<br/>
Hunt), that I wish I had been that way with them from day one.  Being<br/>
honest with your children, letting them know that just because you&#39;re a<br/>
grown-up chronologically doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s no room for change, that&#39;s<br/>
been a big one for me.<br/>
<br/>
They know I am disgusted by my past attitudes and reactions towards<br/>
them.  I&#39;ve divorced myself from the person I used to be, and my<br/>
children are truly the blessing in my life they were from the beginning,<br/>
but I didn&#39;t &quot;get it&quot;.  Now, I am moving onward.  But the past guilt<br/>
sometimes haunts me.<br/>
