<div id="ygrps-yiv-82408634">More evidence that my 12yo ds is learning a ton of stuff from playing online <br/>
games.<br/>
 <br/>
He just sent me a link to a Fox News story about how his favorite game, Maple <br/>
Story, has become a  &quot;craze&quot; that&#39;s &quot;out of control.&quot;  Apparently some kids, <br/>
obviously crazed by addiction, resort to stealing from their parents to buy <br/>
fashion accessories for their characters, while these poor unsuspecting parents <br/>
have let their guard down because they were mislead into thinking the game was <br/>
&quot;supposed to be&quot; free.  <br/>

 <br/>
He was very thorough in pointing out all the misstatements, incorrect <br/>
examples, bad logic and general stupidity in the report.  He insists that none of the <br/>
accessories are necessary to play the game, they don&#39;t give you any advantage <br/>
in the game other than looking cool, and that you can fully play the game <br/>
without buying anything, as he does.  <br/>
 <br/>
So among other things, he learned not to trust the news.  Yay!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1819636377">I&#39;ve been taking a (face-to-face) course on how to teach online  <br/>
courses &lt;g&gt;. Two of the other people in the class with me are  <br/>
librarians who also teach research skills courses at our community  <br/>
college. It has been very interesting to me to see what it is they  <br/>
teach - their biggest challenge seems to be to teach college students  <br/>
to be &quot;critical consumers of information.&quot; Patty, you just pretty much  <br/>
summed up what they spend a whole semester on in a college-level course.<br/>
