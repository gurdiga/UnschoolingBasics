<div id="ygrps-yiv-1551013801">I&#39;d like to see the debate on this topic, too.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what you mean by going to sleep?<br/>
<br/>
My old feeling was that;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;TV programming for kids is stupid and designed to make our kids into stupid lemmings controlled by big corporations, making them into little fashionistas and conformists, teach them how to have destructive social relationships, and kill the earth, and kids programming should be avoided like the plague because it&#39;s just as evil, brainless, manipulative and coercive as school&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My new feeling is kind of like;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;how dare you deny them the one major form of communication of their generation, let them watch it as much as they want and decide for themselves what is and isn&#39;t stupid, they just might like that crap and could possibly use it to make the world a better place&quot;<br/>
<br/>
SO- Each day lately I&#39;ve been rotating different messy art projects and huge activities on our Dining room table, so that there&#39;s never &quot;nothing to do&quot; and I&#39;ve also taken them to the library so they can choose books and, where I used to limit TV to &quot;after 6pm only&quot; I have instead just been saying yes every time they ask, and for the first few days it was on all day long but today it was only on for like 1/2 an hour.  They still choose stupid things (Drake & Josh) and they love it, and I have tried to watch WITH them, but I just can&#39;t enjoy Drake & Josh.  The kids feel the same way about CNN.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m interested in seeing the media debate here, since I obviously have several opposing opinions about the matter, and CNN is owned by a big corporation, too so it&#39;s not really &quot;unbiased news&quot; anyway, is it?<br/>
<br/>
My husband&#39;s mom was a &quot;neat freak&quot; who yelled at the kids all day long to clean, and plugged them into TV so they wouldn&#39;t make messes.  He &quot;needs&quot; the TV on to fall asleep, he&#39;s had one in his room since he was born, and he doesn&#39;t even watch it, but he &quot;needs&quot; the flashing lights and sound.  I on the other hand, have to lay a pillow over my head because the flashing lights make it hard for me to sleep and so does the sound.  For that reason, I have forbidden TVs in my kids rooms, I think it&#39;s nearly a disorder to be unable to fall asleep in silence.  In my mind, that silence is perfect peacefulness, a time to reflect upon the day, think deep thoughts, deliberately relax my body, and create intentions for the next day.  I absolutely cherish the 10-15 minutes of &quot;falling asleep&quot; time, and sometimes I&#39;ll ask my husband to come to bed later than me, so I can have that time to myself.  Usually, though I watch TV with him and lay a pillow over my head when<br/>
 I&#39;ve had enough of it.<br/>
<br/>
I realize that my value-ing of that quiet time doesn&#39;t make me any better or worse than him, and that my efforts to keep my kids from turning into &quot;sleeping TV addicts&quot; is one-sided and maybe his mom didn&#39;t create that, maybe she did- either way, it has nothing to do with my kids.  I don&#39;t love him any less for it. <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s a very odd phenomenon. People will arrive on unschooling lists  <br/>
full of doom and gloom about the negative effects of TV and video  <br/>
games and proceed to tell us, in essence, what our kids are like:  <br/>
that they&#39;re fat on the way to heart attacks, have the attention  <br/>
spans of gnats and they&#39;re irrevocably addicted. And they know that  <br/>
because the book says so.<br/>
<br/>
But if anyone attends an unschooling conference they&#39;ll see loads of  <br/>
kids who are active and well spoken and not intravenously connected  <br/>
to portable TVs.<br/>
<br/>
If there&#39;s any truth to what&#39;s written in the books, since TV and  <br/>
video games aren&#39;t affecting unschooled kids negatively, then it must  <br/>
be school that&#39;s doing it.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s an antidote to the book:<br/>

<br/>
Both my kids like to watch tv and play video games. <br/>
<br/>
Ray&#39;s really social, and always has been, even back before we had a <br/>
tv. He needed almost constant interaction when he was little, for <br/>
sure, and we were living in the woods in a commune. Can&#39;t blame the <br/>
tv on that one ;)<br/>
<br/>
Mo, otoh, is much more of an introvert. She&#39;s had unlimited movies <br/>
from toddlerhood and unlimited satellite tv for a couple years, now, <br/>
plus video games. She&#39;s definately a very busy person - always <br/>
building or creating something, it seems. The tv is often on at the <br/>
same time if she&#39;s inside, but she doesn&#39;t seem distracted by it. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know that child - maybe he goes to school and is worn out <br/>
after a long day? I&#39;m being facetious, but only slightly. I can <br/>
think of plenty of reasons for a school kid to be so utterly wiped <br/>
out as to doze off if not actively kept awake - or just so utterly <br/>
bored, for that matter. That doesn&#39;t really apply to my family.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2008238173">They know what is and isn&#39;t &quot;stupid&quot;.  I remember when Telletubbies (ewwww) first came <br/>
out and my little son saw the commercials and really wanted to watch it.  So on the first <br/>
day, the first show we sat on the sofa together and started to watch. I didn&#39;t say anything.  <br/>
Just sat there (partly in shock I think....lol).  After the baby head sun rose and the tubbies <br/>
came out my ds turned to me with his nose squished up and said, &quot;mom, this is stupid, <br/>
let&#39;s go do something else&quot;.  He was almost 2.<br/>
<br/>
Since then we have seen bits and pieces of shows and the kids have chosen not to like <br/>
them for whatever reason.  They hate spongebob and most of the &quot;ugly&quot; cartoon <br/>
generation, not into simpsons, oddparents, and really can&#39;t stand rugrats.  Fine by me.<br/>
<br/>
What do they like?  Superman and the Justice League, Spiderman, The Tick (how can you <br/>
not like that old goofy cartoon!  Love him...hee hee), Looney Toons (my fav), the old X-<br/>
men cartoons and things like that.  We don&#39;t have anything but basic cable right now so we <br/>
don&#39;t get all the &quot;fancy&quot; channels, just local and cheaper internet.  But when we have had <br/>
cable 95% of the time they would choose discovery channel or animal planet, things like <br/>
that. <br/>
<br/>
As for the news, don&#39;t watch it.  It is all spun.  You will not ever find news without spin.  I <br/>
haven&#39;t forbidden TV for their rooms, we just can&#39;t afford more and the one in the LR/FR is <br/>
just fine since we mostly use it for movies.  If someone isn&#39;t interested in what is on they <br/>
can play a DVD on the computer upstairs or find something else to do...many choices.  My  <br/>
DH and I chose not to have one in the Bedroom because we like to focus on each other as <br/>
it is OUR room... :)<br/>
<br/>
All in all I think that video games and TV do not murderers and thieves make.  I watched <br/>
all sorts of spy and murder mysteries as a kid and I never once took a gun to school or <br/>
shot up the local McDonalds.  It may help mold neglected or injured brains, but ultimately <br/>
it is their choice that makes them a murderer or robber, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents.</div>

the creepy age-difference thing (your age, divided in two + seven -<br/>
anyone younger than that borders on &quot;creepy&quot; for dating!), then we<br/>
ended up saying, &quot;As long as he&#39;s legal! He just needs to be legal!&quot;<br/>
With lots of laughter. THEN I saw Kim Cattrall on Oprah, and SHE said<br/>

***********************<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not a fan of either of those types of show, personally. There <br/>
are some shows I enjoy watching with the kids, others I say &quot;I don&#39;t <br/>
really like this one&quot; and go do something else. Sometimes, if one of <br/>
my kids is really excited about a particular show, I&#39;ll watch more <br/>
of it. If I *really* can&#39;t stand it, I&#39;ll look it up online <br/>
(Wikipedia is good for this), get an idea of who the characters are, <br/>
the main themes, background, whatever - just get myself some more <br/>
information so I can share my kid&#39;s excitement and talk with him or <br/>
her about it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve ended up enjoying some shows more than I expected - Total Drama <br/>
Island for instance, or Family Guy. Others I just can&#39;t get into - <br/>
Ed, Edd and Eddy, for example, and Drake and Josh for that matter. <br/>
One thing I have noticed is that its important for me to watch the <br/>
show for Me - not as The Parent - does that make sense? If I&#39;m <br/>
thinking &quot;do *I* like this?&quot; I will sometimes feel very differently <br/>
than if I&#39;m thinking &quot;is this a good show for my child to watch?&quot; My <br/>
kids are pretty savvy - they know what they like, what disturbs <br/>
them, what scares them. I can&#39;t &quot;know&quot; that for them. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;how dare you deny them the one major form of communication of <br/>

for themselves what is and isn&#39;t stupid, they just might like that <br/>
crap and could possibly use it to make the world a better place&quot;<br/>
***********************<br/>
<br/>
I noticed something really interesting when we switched from having <br/>
just Netflix to just satellite (we can&#39;t afford both at the moment). <br/>
Its a different experience watching a whole season of something in <br/>
one fell swoop as opposed to in weekly installments. It reminded me <br/>
of the way Charles Dickens originally wrote in installments, but we <br/>
*read* his works, today, as complete entities. With that in mind <br/>
(and these days, writers of serial shows have that in mind!) its not <br/>
terribly realistic to look at a single episode of something and make <br/>
decisions about the work as a whole. <br/>
<br/>
I know, I know, some folks are probably rolling their eyes at a <br/>
comparison of Dickens to CSI or Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The point <br/>
I&#39;m getting to, in a rather roundabout manner, is that tv functions <br/>
in some of the same ways as literature. Its not identical, by any <br/>
means, but I honestly don&#39;t think its worse. I&#39;ve certainly had more <br/>
thoughtful, insightful conversations with both my kids about tv <br/>
programs than anything either one of them has read. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;they just might like that crap and could possibly use it to make <br/>
&gt;the world a better place<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Like I said, I&#39;m not a fan of that type of show. Something that <br/>
facinates me, though, is the way some &quot;non-fiction&quot; shows are <br/>
starting to dovetail with the internet. Mythbusters, for example, <br/>
not only solicits ideas from watchers, but has message boards where <br/>
folks can discuss and debate the science behind various concepts - <br/>
some of which come to the show, others not. Its an interesting <br/>
phenomenon - some aspects of tv are actually becoming more <br/>
interactive over time. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I think it&#39;s nearly a disorder to be unable to fall asleep in <br/>
 </span></blockquote>silence.<br/>
<br/>
I had to chuckle over this. I live deep in the country - <br/>
the &quot;hills&#39;n&#39;hollers&quot; of TN. Three quarters of the year, there&#39;s no <br/>
such thing as silence in the evenings. The frogs and crickets and <br/>
cicadas and catydids and owls and wood pigeons create quite the <br/>
racket! With that in mind - maybe its the need for silence that&#39;s <br/>
more abnormal. It may be completely adaptive to *need* a background <br/>
of sounds to fall asleep - lets you know those nocturnal predators <br/>
aren&#39;t sneaking up on you or something ;)<br/>
<br/>
My 7yo used to fall asleep with the tv on nightly - when she was 3-<br/>
5. But she&#39;s since switched to turning the tv off when she&#39;s ready <br/>
to go to sleep. I&#39;ve gone through phases where I couldn&#39;t get to <br/>
sleep without the radio on, or couldn&#39;t get to sleep without reading <br/>
for at least an hour, or knitting, or doing yoga. Weird. But maybe <br/>
reassuring to you. Not only is that sort of thing different for <br/>
different people, it can change.<br/>

&gt; have several opposing opinions about the matter...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure what you want to debate about.  Your post seems really <br/>
clear that you think tv is stupid.  You&#39;re certainly entitled to your <br/>
personal opinion.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s very unschoolish to impose your <br/>
opinions onto your children.  <br/>
<br/>
My personal opinion of tv?  It&#39;s just another thing in our day.  I <br/>
give it no more or less importance than anything else we do.  Yes, <br/>
there are some tv shows I don&#39;t care to watch.  Each of my family <br/>
members has preferences for tv shows.  We also have preferences for <br/>
books, comics, food, drinks, music, games, movies, playing, working, <br/>
and any number of other topics!  I can&#39;t imagine withholding anything <br/>
from my children simply because it is something I don&#39;t like.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; For that reason, I have forbidden TVs in my kids rooms, I think<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s nearly a disorder to be unable to fall asleep in silence.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Forbidden?  Again, you&#39;re imposing your opinion and preference onto <br/>
your children.  I don&#39;t fall asleep to the tv, but neither do I like <br/>
falling asleep in absolute silence.  It&#39;s unnerving and is a major <br/>
source of discomfort and distraction.  I believe in each person being <br/>
able to choose how to fall asleep and respecting those choices even <br/>
if they aren&#39;t the same as mine.  The issue between your husband and <br/>
yourself is simply another opportunity for people needing to learn to <br/>
compromise.  It sounds like you don&#39;t want your children to become <br/>
used to falling asleep to the tv because in the future they may be <br/>
married to someone who doesn&#39;t like falling asleep the same way?<br/>
<br/>
You say you value your quiet time as you fall asleep because it&#39;s a <br/>
time of reflection and peace for you.  But that doesn&#39;t mean you can <br/>
get your children to feel the same way.  This is just another one of <br/>
those things that they&#39;ll grow up knowing is Mom&#39;s thing and then <br/>
will move out and do their own thing.  Why does it even have to be a <br/>
thing?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I realize that my value-ing of that quiet time doesn&#39;t make me any<br/>

&gt; didn&#39;t create that, maybe she did- either way, it has nothing to<br/>
&gt; do with my kids.  I don&#39;t love him any less for it. <br/>
&gt; Lisa<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think you&#39;re not being honest with yourself.  Above, you said <br/>
you&#39;ve forbidden tvs in your children&#39;s rooms because of your <br/>
perception that your DH is a tv addict.  If it has nothing to do with <br/>
the kids, why are you not giving them a chance to make their own <br/>
choices the way you&#39;ve been able to do?<br/>
<br/>
And my last thought is why you feel tv is an addiction.  What about <br/>
other things that some people do a great deal of time because they <br/>
personally enjoy it?  Some people exercise hours a day.  Some people <br/>
read hours a day.  Some people garden hours a day.  Some people watch <br/>
tv hours a day.  Again, tv is just another thing to do in a day.  I <br/>
have seen this debate countless times and someone always posts web <br/>
links to studies that tv watching is not as harmful as others <br/>
believe.  I don&#39;t have those links but they&#39;re likely easy to find if <br/>
you care to look.  I personally think it&#39;s just another thing that <br/>
some parents like to control because they can.  I met a woman at a <br/>
homeschool park day who was very proud of herself for forbidding her <br/>
children to read books in bed pretty much for the same reason you&#39;ve <br/>
forbidden tv.  I suppose that&#39;s her thing.  I have an opinion of <br/>
that &quot;thing&quot; but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s right of me to impose that <br/>
opinion on her, you or anyone else.<br/>

town, population 500, maybe its 501 idk. We rarely have cars pass after dark<br/>
but there is always noise of some sort. There are animals domestics and<br/>
farm. we even have skunks from time to time but they aren&#39;t noisy :-) Still<br/>
it isn&#39;t silent. You would need to put ear things on to cover all noise. I<br/>
am much more impressed that my kids can fall asleep anywhere, really<br/>
*anywhere*. I use to take my dd in a sling to music shows starting when she<br/>
was tiny. She would fall asleep to thundering punk rock music, sweet and<br/>
content. She and I traveled around in our truck for a bit and she<br/>
would/could fall asleep anywhere doing anything. Sleep was just what you do<br/>
when you are tired, she didn&#39;t need anything more than me (then). For a<br/>
couple years she would fall asleep most nights watching TV, it relaxed her.<br/>
Now she prefers to read. I like that she knows herself and has the ability<br/>
to be flexible.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>HA! I think it&#39;s nearly a disorder to NEED total silence. It&#39;s not<br/>
natural to have total silence in very many locations on earth!<br/>
<br/>
Like we need to call anything else a &quot;disorder&quot;. Sheesh. Any quirk or<br/>
trait gets labeled a disorder these days. I&#39;m over it.<br/>
<br/>
How about trusting that everyone is totally unique and can choose the<br/>
perfect sleep situation for themselves?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-341396474">As someone mentioned, silence is the &quot;newer&quot; thing since way back in the<br/>
long ago eat or be eaten times, total silence usually meant a predator<br/>
nearby because all the smaller creatures would go still to try to avoid<br/>
being some creature&#39;s midnight snack. <br/>
<br/>
Plus, for some folks, TV acts as a white noise - not something to listen<br/>
to so much as something to block out other, more distracting noises. For<br/>
folks who have trouble sleeping with the TV on who share sleeping space<br/>
with TV white noise folks, maybe something like a fan or white noise<br/>
machine of some sort might work as a middle ground.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-321370750">I can tell you TV is something that I have worried about off and on <br/>
on my unschooling journey, esp. when dd was around age 4 and getting <br/>
really interested in it.  All the usual reasons...it would decrease <br/>
her attention span, turn her into a zombie, etc, affect her like all <br/>
the studies say.  I am getting better at not panicking about it <br/>
though, although once a year or so I have my moments, LOL!<br/>
<br/>
I had to really stop and think about what others were saying and see <br/>
it was true in my own situation too...<br/>
<br/>
1)Dd does not LITERALLY watch it all day (Sandra Dodd does a good job <br/>
at her site with talking about people who make broad all or nothing <br/>
statements like this...we say this stuff like it is actually <br/>
literally true).  She does other things too...comic book creating, <br/>
computer games, is more than willing to go out with me and ds/dh and <br/>
do other stuff, read, etc.  The TV is just one more thing, very <br/>
attractive to her because she is a VERY visually oriented person in <br/>
her learning, and remembers EVERYTHING she sees.  I can see that in <br/>
so many areas in how she learns (I am convinced that allowing her <br/>
interest in the computer and playing on Starfall.com with her plus of <br/>
course her brain being ready was a major factor in reading clicking <br/>
for her!) She also is big into computer right now.<br/>
<br/>
2)I think the biggest advice I took from all those pro TV unschoolers <br/>
was to just swallow my fear (hard at first) and look at TV as a <br/>
bonding time with her.  Now it is nice to sit and just cuddle on the <br/>
couch and watch, instead of looking at her thinking she is <br/>
doing &quot;nothing&quot;.  When I sit and watch with her, so many questions <br/>
and connections and learning moments come up and it can branch into <br/>
so many things.  <br/>
<br/>
3)Like others have said elsewhere in cyberspace, the TV studies are <br/>
done on schooled children, who may need an escape after all that <br/>
school.  Also, no indication of if a parent is watching mindfully <br/>
with them or if they are plunked in front of it.  I also wonder <br/>
in &quot;those studies&quot; how it is possible they watch 4-5 hours a day when <br/>
they have school to go to!<br/>
<br/>
MOST IMPORTANTLY, I think the biggest thing I found, when I really <br/>
examined my thoughts about tv, was that the times when I worried or <br/>
found myself thinking that she does nothing all day but watch tv, was <br/>
that I felt this way because I hadn&#39;t truly taken time to connect <br/>
with her and BE with her...like being in the house and she does her <br/>
thing and I am doing mine.  She was getting grumpy about lack of <br/>
connection, and I was about the TV  The TV was just a convienient <br/>
scapegoat for those feelings.  We have started making a list each <br/>
morning of 3-4 things that she wants to do with me that day. It has <br/>
been anything from playing our board games, to going to the library, <br/>
to baking cookies, to working on her comic strips, and yes, to <br/>
watching Fairly OddParents together or playing on Poptropica <br/>
together.  Focusing on our relationship and just BEING together in <br/>
any activity including tv and computer is what is healing me from <br/>
those feelings that she &quot;isn&#39;t learning anything&quot; or unschooling <br/>
isn&#39;t working.  Yes, she is 8 and her only writing output is comic <br/>
strips, or she doesn&#39;t like workbook math and is only JUST getting <br/>
comfortable playing the odd game, and maybe she would look miore like <br/>
a schooled kid (unfortunatley whose writing experiences say, are <br/>
coerced in many cases not done because it has meaning to them) in <br/>
these areas if she didn&#39;t watch tv, but her life is rich and full and <br/>
she is making her own unique learning connections, even if through <br/>
asking questions about what is on TV and then we get a book, or I see <br/>
it in her and ds imaginary play together.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps any doubters or anyone on this journey of <br/>
deschooling our assumptions about tv.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ok.  I had to comment.  School does a lot less than the above.<br/>
<br/>
I went through all of high school, community college (2 year) and 2<br/>
universities.  I got a diploma and a BA degree.  Granted, I hated school<br/>
(except Kindergarten and 1st & 2nd grade) until I got to ETSU in Tennessee.<br/>
Even there, people were telling me an art degree would be useless.  I felt<br/>
that an English degree would be a dead end for me.  Good thing I listened to<br/>
me.  I found painting, sculpture, metalworking, bookmaking, fiber art,<br/>
printmaking, just to name a few.  I had a hard time picking a concentration<br/>
because I didn&#39;t like the painting area&#39;s professor&#39;s painting style or way<br/>
of talking to the students... awful critiquing methods.<br/>
<br/>
In grade school and high school I wanted to write but never did.  School is<br/>
all about boring busy work that doesn&#39;t prepare a student to do what they&#39;re<br/>
interested in.  It keeps them occupied until the day they can finally take<br/>
up important work.  Usually that means forget about your interests in favor<br/>
of working a dead end job of little interest to oneself.  I didn&#39;t have time<br/>
or mental space to think about having comic book output.<br/>
<br/>
I was lucky.  Somehow I was able to ignore the voices telling me *not* to<br/>
follow my interests and did what I wanted to do.  That&#39;s not typical.  Many<br/>
people in school have heard the message that their interests don&#39;t matter<br/>
for so long that they believe it and have no idea what they&#39;re interested in<br/>
anymore.<br/>
