<div id="ygrps-yiv-1399575105">My son Liam (9) is having a hard time with this concept.  He&#39;s nervous<br/>
he will &quot;be behind&quot; (because he&#39;s been to school) and I don&#39;t know<br/>
what to tell him.  &quot;How will I get into college with no grades?&quot;  &quot;Do<br/>
I need to take the GED?&quot;  That kind of thing.  He&#39;s kind of a worrier<br/>
by nature...well a quiet worrier, so this stuff bounces around in his<br/>
brain for a long time until he&#39;s finally overwrought and it comes out.<br/>
 And I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve been able to give him an answer that helps him<br/>
relax.  John on the other hand (11) doesn&#39;t seem to ever worry about<br/>
it at all.<br/>
<br/>
So what do you recommend I say to Liam to help him relax?  I want him<br/>
to know that he can be a Dr or whatever he decides he wants to do when<br/>
he gets older even if he hasn&#39;t been put through the public school<br/>
combine.<br/>
<br/>
And if we move to DC he wants to go to a private Jewish school.  (It&#39;s<br/>
13K a year YIKES!)  I&#39;ve told him we can go visit it (our moving there<br/>
is very iffy really so we don&#39;t plan to far out) and see what he<br/>
thinks.  I don&#39;t know what to say to him.  If he wants to go back to<br/>
school do I encourage him to do that?  He does seem to do better when<br/>
he&#39;s in school because he doesn&#39;t worry about this other stuff and I<br/>
can&#39;t help but think if I could do a better job of answering him he<br/>
could relax about it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-172391409">The Teenage Liberation Handbook might be a good resource for Liam. It is a sort of guide to how an immersive life can produce an amazingly well-educated individual. As a side note there is no reason why he can&#39;t get a GED. I dropped out of high school and have a GED and a master&#39;s degree in Evolutionary Anthropology. The GED didn&#39;t limit me at all, I&#39;m not sure about the master&#39;s degree. Doing a quick google with &quot;homeschool college&quot; I found this site <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ehow.com/how_7571_college-homeschool.html.">http://www.ehow.com/how_7571_college-homeschool.html.</a> I would find the answers to his questions so that you could help to calm his fears. <br/>
<br/>
I think it must be really hard to feel like you are falling behind. I can remember at the beginning of every school year planning to be good, to buckle down and work hard. I would have my three ring binder organised because organisation was the key to knowledge, right? Oh and I always failed by about the 3rd week in. And I floundered all year, knowing that I should be able to do this stuff, but I just couldn&#39;t. Knowing that I would never be any good at anything. Poor Liam. It must be scary to have those kinds of fears whirling around in your brain. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/teens">http://sandradodd.com/teens</a> might comfort a bit. Although it might make him feel lacking. It is easy to compare yourself line for line with someone else and see how you don&#39;t measure up. In the end the best way to make him feel better might be to up the engagement in his life. Not that I am suggesting he doesn&#39;t have an engaging life, but sometimes those fears could be a product of not feeling active or<br/>
 involved enough. <br/>

<br/>
==========================<br/>
<br/>
My <br/>
son <br/>
Liam <br/>
(9) <br/>
is <br/>
having <br/>
a <br/>
hard <br/>
time <br/>
with <br/>
this <br/>
concept.  <br/>
He&#39;s <br/>
nervous<br/>
he <br/>
will <br/>
&quot;be <br/>
behind&quot; <br/>
(because <br/>
he&#39;s <br/>
been <br/>
to <br/>
school) <br/>
and <br/>
I <br/>
don&#39;t <br/>
know<br/>
what <br/>
to <br/>
tell <br/>
him.  <br/>
&quot;How <br/>
will <br/>
I <br/>
get <br/>
into <br/>
college <br/>
with <br/>
no <br/>
grades?&quot;  <br/>
&quot;Do<br/>
I <br/>
need <br/>
to <br/>
take <br/>
the <br/>
GED?&quot;  <br/>
That <br/>
kind <br/>
of <br/>
thing.  <br/>
He&#39;s <br/>
kind <br/>
of <br/>
a <br/>
worrier<br/>
by <br/>
nature...well <br/>
a <br/>
quiet <br/>
worrier, <br/>
so <br/>
this <br/>
stuff <br/>
bounces <br/>
around <br/>
in <br/>
his<br/>
brain <br/>
for <br/>
a <br/>
long <br/>
time <br/>
until <br/>
he&#39;s <br/>
finally <br/>
overwrought <br/>
and <br/>
it <br/>
comes <br/>
out.<br/>
 <br/>
And <br/>
I <br/>
don&#39;t <br/>
think <br/>
I&#39;ve <br/>
been <br/>
able <br/>
to <br/>
give <br/>
him <br/>
an <br/>
answer <br/>
that <br/>
helps <br/>
him<br/>
relax.  <br/>
John <br/>
on <br/>
the <br/>
other <br/>
hand <br/>
(11) <br/>
doesn&#39;t <br/>
seem <br/>
to <br/>
ever <br/>
worry <br/>
about<br/>
it <br/>
at <br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>
So <br/>
what <br/>
do <br/>
you <br/>
recommend <br/>
I <br/>
say <br/>
to <br/>
Liam <br/>
to <br/>
help <br/>
him <br/>
relax?  <br/>
I <br/>
want <br/>
him<br/>
to <br/>
know <br/>
that <br/>
he <br/>
can <br/>
be <br/>
a <br/>
Dr <br/>
or <br/>
whatever <br/>
he <br/>
decides <br/>
he <br/>
wants <br/>
to <br/>
do <br/>
when<br/>
he <br/>
gets <br/>
older <br/>
even <br/>
if <br/>
he <br/>
hasn&#39;t <br/>
been <br/>
put <br/>
through <br/>
the <br/>
public <br/>
school<br/>
combine.<br/>
<br/>
And <br/>
if <br/>
we <br/>
move <br/>
to <br/>
DC <br/>
he <br/>
wants <br/>
to <br/>
go <br/>
to <br/>
a <br/>
private <br/>
Jewish <br/>
school.  <br/>
(It&#39;s<br/>
13K <br/>
a <br/>
year <br/>
YIKES!)  <br/>
I&#39;ve <br/>
told <br/>
him <br/>
we <br/>
can <br/>
go <br/>
visit <br/>
it <br/>
(our <br/>
moving <br/>
there<br/>
is <br/>
very <br/>
iffy <br/>
really <br/>
so <br/>
we <br/>
don&#39;t <br/>
plan <br/>
to <br/>
far <br/>
out) <br/>
and <br/>
see <br/>
what <br/>
he<br/>
thinks.  <br/>
I <br/>
don&#39;t <br/>
know <br/>
what <br/>
to <br/>
say <br/>
to <br/>
him.  <br/>
If <br/>
he <br/>
wants <br/>
to <br/>
go <br/>
back <br/>
to<br/>
school <br/>
do <br/>
I <br/>
encourage <br/>
him <br/>
to <br/>
do <br/>
that?  <br/>
He <br/>
does <br/>
seem <br/>
to <br/>
do <br/>
better <br/>
when<br/>
he&#39;s <br/>
in <br/>
school <br/>
because <br/>
he <br/>
doesn&#39;t <br/>
worry <br/>
about <br/>
this <br/>
other <br/>
stuff <br/>
and <br/>
I<br/>
can&#39;t <br/>
help <br/>
but <br/>
think <br/>
if <br/>
I <br/>
could <br/>
do <br/>
a <br/>
better <br/>
job <br/>
of <br/>
answering <br/>
him <br/>
he<br/>
could <br/>
relax <br/>
about <br/>
it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2127309361">Thanks I&#39;ll get that book and we&#39;ll look at the web sites.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that Liam&#39;s life isn&#39;t engaging enough, I think it&#39;s the lack<br/>
of *measureables&quot; that does it.  It reminds me of the cartoon Franklin<br/>
which we are watching again because of Morgan =)  Anyway, they are all<br/>
losing teeth but Franklin doesn&#39;t because turtles don&#39;t have teeth and<br/>
he&#39;s OK about that until one of his friends says &quot;Without teeth...how<br/>
do you know you are getting bigger?&quot;  And I think that&#39;s the thing for<br/>
Liam, &quot;Without grades how do I know I&#39;m learning and if I know I&#39;m<br/>
learning how will other people know it?&quot;  So those sites may just calm<br/>
his fears.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much!<br/>

My son Liam (9) is having a hard time with this concept.  He&#39;s nervous<br/>
he will &quot;be behind&quot; (because he&#39;s been to school) and I don&#39;t know<br/>
what to tell him.  &quot;How will I get into college with no grades?&quot;  &quot;Do<br/>
I need to take the GED?&quot;  That kind of thing.  He&#39;s kind of a worrier<br/>
by nature...well a quiet worrier, so this stuff bounces around in his<br/>
brain for a long time until he&#39;s finally overwrought and it comes out.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Cameron had the same doubts. We&#39;d sent him to a private prep school, so <br/>
not only did he have those thoughts instilled by the school and his <br/>
teachers and peers, but by ME too! He was 13 when we pulled him out, <br/>
and it took YEARS for him to be able to see that this was a *good* <br/>
thing.<br/>
<br/>
Now, he never actually wanted to go BACK to school, but he wasn&#39;t sure <br/>
I was all-so-flippin&#39;-smart either. &lt;g&gt; Talking to his friends <br/>
*continually* gave him reason to wonder whether this was a good idea or <br/>
not. &quot;Not&quot; generally won out.<br/>
<br/>
He can look back now and agree it was a great idea---this unschooling <br/>
stuff, but that doesn&#39;t change how he felt *then*.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
So what do you recommend I say to Liam to help him relax?  I want him<br/>
to know that he can be a Dr or whatever he decides he wants to do when<br/>
he gets older even if he hasn&#39;t been put through the public school<br/>
combine.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I know it&#39;s hard now. BTDT. Honestly, not much *you* can say will make <br/>
a difference---not for a while, anyway. I mean---it wasn&#39;t that long <br/>
ago that *you* made him go to school, right? &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t remember where you are. Is it possible to get to a conference? <br/>
Meeting other teens can help a LOT. Older teens/young adults especially.<br/>
<br/>
Just seeing the absolute JOY in them---and how remarkably comfortable <br/>
they are with each other, with their own selves, with adults, and with <br/>
their environment---he can&#39;t help but be inspired (you too!).<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And if we move to DC he wants to go to a private Jewish school.  (It&#39;s<br/>
13K a year YIKES!)  I&#39;ve told him we can go visit it (our moving there<br/>
is very iffy really so we don&#39;t plan to far out) and see what he<br/>
thinks.  I don&#39;t know what to say to him.  If he wants to go back to<br/>
school do I encourage him to do that?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t *encourage* it. But I wouldn&#39;t deny it either. Make *home* a <br/>
place that offers as much---if not *more* than school ever could.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
He does seem to do better when<br/>
he&#39;s in school because he doesn&#39;t worry about this other stuff and I<br/>
can&#39;t help but think if I could do a better job of answering him he<br/>
could relax about it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever seen/read The Shawshank Redemption? Stephen King?<br/>
<br/>
One of the characters gets released. He can&#39;t handle it. Prison is all <br/>
he&#39;s ever known. It&#39;s a *safe* place for him because he&#39;s been told for <br/>
the majority of his life what, when, and how. He has too hard of a time <br/>
dealing with freedom on the outside, so he hangs himself.<br/>
<br/>
I think school can *do* that to us as well. Freedom&#39;s HARD. It&#39;s a <br/>
*job* to learn how to handle freedom and all it entails. Sometimes the <br/>
familiarity of NO freedom is easier.<br/>
<br/>
It DOES get better. Time and patience.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hey, Karen,<br/>
<br/>
As you know, I have a Liam, too!  What a guy!  He has not always been <br/>
unschooled.  He went to a Montessori kindergarten and half of first <br/>
grade.  He left there with an extremely crummy opinion of <br/>
himself.  Even though I had gotten a job working there so I could be <br/>
there with him all the time, and even though I expressly instructed <br/>
the teacher not to impose so-called learning activities on him unless <br/>
he specifically asked, he walked away feeling that he was less than <br/>
the other kids because they were being forced to do acquire skills he <br/>
was simply not ready for and didn&#39;t need.  Breaks my damn heart, <br/>
thinking of what I had put him through (even though I had always <br/>
believed we&#39;d unschool!).<br/>
<br/>
(Briefly, my screwed-up MO was to attempt to unschool him in this <br/>
kid-rich environment; he craved being around other kids, and there <br/>
flat-out weren&#39;t any around.  I thought I could bring in unschooling <br/>
the way other kids bring lunch from home.  I&#39;m here to tell you that <br/>
it TOTALLY doesn&#39;t work that way!)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I am delighted to report that he no longer sees himself in <br/>
that dim light, even though he only just within the past year <br/>
acquired reading.  He sees himself as the brilliant person he is.  I <br/>
know this because he was trying to figure out where we were hiding <br/>
his birthday presents.  He was drilling me: &quot;Is it in your closet?&quot; <br/>
etc.  And then he stopped and said, &quot;Wait a minute.  I&#39;m smart; I can <br/>
figure this out.&quot;  And then he did!  He accurately surmised that I <br/>
buy his presents online and have them shipped elsewhere.  (Naturally, <br/>
I didn&#39;t let on.  I said, &quot;Oooohhh, now *that&#39;s* a good idea!&quot;  I <br/>
gotta try to stay one step ahead of this kid, and that&#39;s not so easy; <br/>
he&#39;s as sharp as a tack!)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I think what has helped Liam was gaining a better definition <br/>
of &quot;smart&quot; and &quot;intelligent,&quot; etc.  These words had meant something <br/>
to him, despite his brief experience, in a schoolish way.  But, the <br/>
school-definitions of those words are not real-life definitions, and <br/>
it was important for him to get that.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing is that we show him his brilliance through our <br/>
eyes.  It&#39;s not really praise; it&#39;s more like recognition and <br/>
acknowledgement.  We&#39;re subtle about it, and we give him ample <br/>
opportunities where we can, if I may borrow an expression from <br/>
another wonderful unschooling list, see him Shine, and I believe he <br/>
sees his own Shine reflected back in our loving, joyful eyes.<br/>
<br/>
As Kelly said, it takes time and patience.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I don&#39;t know if this is all that helpful or even germane to <br/>
your question; it&#39;s just our experience.  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-165410607">For a while my oldest argued with his brothers about who&#39;s smartest.<br/>
He really felt the need to prove his intellectual superiority and took<br/>
it personally when a four-year-old insisted he was smarter. One of the<br/>
twins also picked up &quot;stupid&quot; from preschool. He was quite adept on<br/>
picking up the sign for it as well.<br/>

&gt; etc.  And then he stopped and said, &quot;Wait a minute.  I&#39;m smart; I can<br/>
&gt; figure this out.&quot;  And then he did!  He accurately surmised that I<br/>
&gt; buy his presents online and have them shipped elsewhere.  (Naturally,<br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t let on.  I said, &quot;Oooohhh, now *that&#39;s* a good idea!&quot;  I<br/>
&gt; gotta try to stay one step ahead of this kid, and that&#39;s not so easy;<br/>
&gt; he&#39;s as sharp as a tack!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, I think what has helped Liam was gaining a better definition<br/>
&gt; of &quot;smart&quot; and &quot;intelligent,&quot; etc.  These words had meant something<br/>
&gt; to him, despite his brief experience, in a schoolish way.  But, the<br/>
&gt; school-definitions of those words are not real-life definitions, and<br/>
&gt; it was important for him to get that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Another thing is that we show him his brilliance through our<br/>
&gt; eyes.  It&#39;s not really praise; it&#39;s more like recognition and<br/>
&gt; acknowledgement.  We&#39;re subtle about it, and we give him ample<br/>
&gt; opportunities where we can, if I may borrow an expression from<br/>
&gt; another wonderful unschooling list, see him Shine, and I believe he<br/>
&gt; sees his own Shine reflected back in our loving, joyful eyes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As Kelly said, it takes time and patience.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, I don&#39;t know if this is all that helpful or even germane to<br/>
&gt; your question; it&#39;s just our experience.  :-)<br/>
