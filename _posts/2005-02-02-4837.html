<div id="ygrps-yiv-157430885">This is interesting that this has come up. I recently was part of an on-line<br/>
conversation on a non-unschooling homeschool list about unschooling. It was<br/>
brought up because of an article I was part of in the local paper about<br/>
unschooling. The conversation was very respectful which isn&#39;t always the<br/>
case on non-unschooling lists...anyway, being &quot;well rounded&quot; was brought up<br/>
and discussed. It&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve run into that concern in regards to<br/>
unschooling.  The concern expressed was basically &quot;if I don&#39;t force my kids<br/>
to learn certain things, they will not be &#39;well rounded&#39;&quot; We discussed the<br/>
definition of &#39;well rounded&#39; which of course, had different meanings to<br/>
different people so defining our meanings cleared up a lot. It seems to me<br/>
that in this day and age it is impossible to know &#39;a little about<br/>
everything&#39; (one of the definitions that was used) and being exposed to<br/>
different things, places, people, etc is going to be limited to some degree<br/>
by one&#39;s income, location, interests, etc. regardless of how one is<br/>
educated. I&#39;m not particularly worried about my kids being &#39;well rounded&#39;.<br/>
My kids have areas of interest they pursue...but because of friends, my own<br/>
interests, activities they&#39;re involved in, they become exposed to things<br/>
they wouldn&#39;t on their own.  They are more &#39;well rounded&#39; than some, less<br/>
than others....but what seems right for us at this time.  So though I&#39;m not<br/>
worried about it, I find it an interesting topic of conversation and<br/>
thought. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1670488340">I have been wondering something along these lines too.<br/>
Specifically, how would you veteran unschoolers handle a child who, when given total freedom to direct their own learning, will choose to plop down in front of the television set or their Gameboy every day, rather than go outdoors to inspect nature, or read a book, or do a baking or science project, or do any physical activity, etc.?   I realize television can be educational, but what if that was all the child ever wanted to do?  OK, I can see an obvious answer - get rid of the television! LOL, but seriously, even if there is no TV in your home, how would you handle a child who is lazy about anything to do with education, such as writing or reading something now and then, etc.? <br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Those sound like ridiculous questions but you can help yourself see real<br/>
learning by first seeing that TV and GameBoy and nature and books are all<br/>
legitimate ways of exploring the world.<br/>
<br/>
And then second get involved with your child. Find out what he loves about<br/>
what he&#39;s doing.<br/>
<br/>
And make sure he&#39;s happy. Is he choosing TV and GameBoy because the other<br/>
options aren&#39;t as engaging *to him*? Is there something else in his life and<br/>
TV and GameBoya are an escape. Taking away the TV and GameBoy doesn&#39;t solve<br/>
why it&#39;s happening. That will still be there. (And add stress to both your<br/>
lives on top of it.)<br/>
<br/>
And then make sure he has opportunities that *he* likes just as well as TV<br/>
and GameBoy available regularly. It&#39;s your responsiblity to strew<br/>
opportunites not your responsibility to make him try them! ;-) But if your<br/>
strewing is falling flat it might be that you&#39;re too focused on things that<br/>
are &quot;good for him&quot; and not as atuned to what he loves as you could be. Or it<br/>
could be that he&#39;s going through a period of needed to do exactly what he&#39;s<br/>
doing.<br/>
<br/>
If you focus on the negative of getting him to stop doing what he&#39;s doing,<br/>
he&#39;ll sense that and cling to it because it will feel like it&#39;s on the verge<br/>
of becoming limited or forbidden and he&#39;ll need to get as much as possible.<br/>
<br/>
If you focus on the positive of strewing his life with things he enjoys, the<br/>
calmer he&#39;ll be about leaving the TV and GameBoy.<br/>
<br/>
Gaming magazines? Game reviews (and perhaps writing them) at Amazon?<br/>
Conventions? Selling old games on eBay? Trivia games on the internet?<br/>
Checklists and episode descriptions of his favorite TV shows.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that helped my daughter was getting TiVo. I think it&#39;s easy to<br/>
feel a slave to the programming schedule. Kids can feel like they have to be<br/>
there to watch or they&#39;ll miss something. TiVo can record favorite shows on<br/>
its hard drive automatically (you just key in the name of the show and get a<br/>
&quot;Season Pass&quot; to it -- you don&#39;t need to know when it&#39;s on or what channel).<br/>
(The hard drives hold 30-100 or so hours of programs but you can transfer<br/>
them to video tape if he likes watching the same episodes again.) That way<br/>
the shows can be available whenever a child feels like watching rather than<br/>
only when the programmers decide to put it on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1444627066">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Specifically, how would you veteran unschoolers handle a child who,<br/>
when given total freedom to direct their own learning, will choose to plop<br/>

go outdoors to inspect nature, or read a book, or do a baking or science<br/>
project, or do any physical activity, etc.? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d assume that&#39;s what the child wanted and needed that day. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d not hassle them with expressed judgments (even if I felt any) about<br/>
other activities being better, which will only enhance the child&#39;s desire<br/>
for the tv and gameboys, and could make the child feel bad about liking<br/>
these things. Although I do, as others have suggested, look around at what<br/>
else is going on and try to keep plenty of other stuff available.<br/>
<br/>
Is the kid still deschooling? I ask this because you use the possibly<br/>
schooly phrase &quot;science project&quot;. Last week Jayn (5) and I created a bunch<br/>
of different herbal decoctions. She had been experimenting with mixing<br/>
different spices and herbs in flour to &quot;make pies&quot;, and we both got<br/>
interested in the aromas. I suggested making some perfume using some alcohol<br/>
and then Jayn wanted to keep making more and more. So it kinda turned into a<br/>
big project of putting various combinations - all her devising - into<br/>
different liquids. Now we have some amazing flavored honey, fragrant dish<br/>
soap, strongly flavored vinegar, alcohol rub, and aromatic massage oil.<br/>
Water just went icky - as I warned Jayn that it probably would. <br/>
<br/>
None of this was in the nature of a &quot;school project&quot; or with the idea that<br/>
she &quot;should&quot; learn some science (how could she not?), but just because it<br/>
was fun, and because initially *I* got excited about the lovely fragrance<br/>
she was creating with her mixtures and wanted to preserve it somehow.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn watches a varying amount of tv or dvd&#39;s every day. Usually she watches<br/>
in conjunction with playing other games. She also uses tv as a segue into<br/>
her day in the morning, and late at night when I am just too pooped to play<br/>
on. She doesn&#39;t seem to care for Gameboy - I think she prefers better<br/>
graphics than that tiny screen can render. She plays various computer games,<br/>
and will request dh or I to play particular X-box games for her, while she<br/>
watches avidly and comments and makes suggestions. I usually watch her shows<br/>
with her or nearby, especially attentive if they are new to me.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH at this moment she is in the bedroom watching a dvd alone. It will only<br/>
be a few more minutes before she calls to me to join her I&#39;m sure. Today my<br/>
plans include cleaning out the fridge and general tidying. Jayn wants to hit<br/>
the park later on, and invite our neighbor to play for a while. I expect<br/>
there will be plenty of tv/dvd in the background, and some reading later on.<br/>
I have taken to reading to Jayn while she is in her tub, if she wants me to.<br/>
Now how to get a tv into the bathroom......;)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I realize television can be educational, but what if that was all the<br/>
child ever wanted to do?  OK, I can see an obvious answer - get rid of the<br/>
television!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I CAN see that you are joking, however this is often (not here but in other<br/>
places) put forward as a serious and genuine answer. In case anyone gets the<br/>
idea that this is a good idea, I would discourage anyone to do this in this<br/>
situation, because I feel very strongly that the child could not help but<br/>
see it as punitive. What next? The Gameboy goes if it is played &quot;too much&quot;?<br/>
Perhaps the child would immediately learn the usefulness of subterfuge and a<br/>
need to keep their interests hidden from Mom in case that was the next thing<br/>
removed. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; LOL, but seriously, even if there is no TV in your home, how would you<br/>
handle a child who is lazy about anything to do with education, such as<br/>
writing or reading something now and then, etc.? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I try not to use this kind of damning negative language about my child -<br/>
even in my own mind. I don&#39;t try to handle *her*, but only my own reactions<br/>
and language. It gets easier, or at least I have found it so, the more I<br/>
practice acceptance of where she is at. There it is really - a conscious<br/>
choice to a practice acceptance and use positive (or neutral) words.<br/>
<br/>
While ever you keep dividing real life into sanctioned educational and<br/>
&quot;other than&quot;, you will find it tough to get to Unschooling. While ever you<br/>
keep the idea that &quot;laziness&quot;, rather than say &quot;lack of interest at the<br/>
moment&quot; or &quot;prefers other activities&quot;, as your expressed view of your child<br/>
you will find it harder to get to Unschooling with joy.<br/>
