<div id="ygrps-yiv-714439177">&quot;If you know chocolate you&#39;re on your way<br/>
to understanding the secrets of the universe. : )&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The very best secrets too...:)<br/>
<br/>
I found a recipe during my chocolate ramblings, that was based on the <br/>
ancient Mayan version, but with modern ingredients. It had the chile <br/>
peppers and all...makes me want to watch Chocolat again.<br/>
<br/>
Now I suppose you&#39;ll all want that one too? Sheesh.<br/>

makes a peppered cocoa that DH likes on cold wintry evenings - it&#39;s <br/>
really a nice place, converted from an old firehouse (with the pole <br/>
and everything!) It&#39;s really a cozy place to relax.<br/>
