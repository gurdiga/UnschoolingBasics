<div id="ygrps-yiv-854226525">Same here, when I look around at my little circle of friends, all of whom<br/>
give birth at home, I think there&#39;s got to be a larger number.  But, we<br/>
certainly are nowhere inside any sort of box, so there ya have it!<br/>
<br/>
I live in SD, where it&#39;s legal to have a homebirth, but illegal for anyone<br/>
to attend.  How stupid is that?  We&#39;ve been taking bills to the legislation<br/>
FORever, and people just seem to be afraid of the whole concept, they can&#39;t<br/>
get past &quot;dead babies&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Yes,  babies *never* die in the hospital.  Ugh.<br/>
<br/>
So, I had one homebirth (in the water) with a secret midwife.  (who was then<br/>
later arrested because one of her clients turned her in when her birth<br/>
didn&#39;t go the way she wanted it to go)<br/>
<br/>
Then, the next homebirth (in water) we did unassisted.  And now, that&#39;s how<br/>
I&#39;d plan to give birth again, if we ever decide on a fourth child.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also a doula, and would love to be a midwife, when I&#39;m all grown up! ;)<br/>
<br/>
Sweet memories,<br/>

&gt;   I was *so* surprised in the movie, when they stated the number of<br/>
&gt; homebirths in the US - less than 1%! Closer to half of a percent. When<br/>
&gt; I heard that, I thought... that doesn&#39;t seem right. A lot of my<br/>
&gt; friends had homebirths... *then* I remembered I was probably a *bit*<br/>
&gt; out of the mainstream. lol<br/>

<br/>
I just wanted to respond to the sentence about malpractice...birthing<br/>
is, by it&#39;s very nature, a life or death possibility. In a hospital or<br/>
at home. <br/>
<br/>
When a woman gives birth at home and something goes wrong, it&#39;s<br/>
assumed the midwife is at fault nowadays. &quot;Serious malpractice.&quot; If<br/>
something goes wrong with a hospital birth, from what I&#39;ve seen and<br/>
heard, there&#39;s a whole lot of blame put on the mother: oh, your uterus<br/>
was unripe, your hips are too small, you wouldn&#39;t contracting fast<br/>
enough, or whatever. There doesn&#39;t seem to be the automatic &quot;man, that<br/>
doctor eff&#39;ed up&quot; response. Where&#39;s the automatic malpractice label?  <br/>
<br/>
Either way a woman loses when there&#39;s a difficult or tragic birth<br/>
experience. People don&#39;t automatically talk about malpractice in<br/>
hospital births as much as they jump to that when talking about<br/>
homebirths. As if home births are inherently more dangerous than<br/>
hospital births. As if there is a band of renegade midwives out there<br/>
looking to be cavalier and reckless with birthing. <br/>
<br/>
And in Karen&#39;s post with the lady turning in the midwife! because the<br/>
birth didn&#39;t go as she wanted it to go *really* bugs me because would<br/>
that woman have taken the doctor to court for malpractice if the birth<br/>
didn&#39;t go the way she wanted in the hospital? Probably not. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s late. I need to go to sleep. I hope this makes sense..<br/>
