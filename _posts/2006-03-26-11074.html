<div id="ygrps-yiv-1573322772">I have to say I just love this list. When I get up in the morning these<br/>
are the first messages I read in my email.<br/>
My daughter and I have recently started an unschooling penpal group.<br/>
It&#39;s for everyone not just children. My daughter is running the group<br/>
and I&#39;m just there as a guide. She set the settings to private so your<br/>
email and home address&#39; will be safe.<br/>
