<div id="ygrps-yiv-1915509664">&quot;So I&#39;d think they acknowledge that people make other sandwiches, but any<br/>
religious dogma would say that the sandwich is not made in the right way.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But then you get into stuff like Zen, that says there is no Dogma or<br/>
creed and that each person has to find the truth within themselves.<br/>
It&#39;s really a philosophy,not a religion...ah, but then human beings<br/>
take a nice philosophy and turn it into a religion.<br/>

Well, I&#39;m UU (Unitarian Universalist) and our religion has principles, but<br/>
no dogma.  Everyone is expected to bring their own sandwich and be<br/>
respectful of everyone else&#39;s sandwich. &lt;bg&gt;<br/>

<br/>
I love the UU&#39;s. :o) We have a lovely congregation here in Corvallis that I&#39;ve attended. But, for the purpose of this metaphor, is UU really considered a religion? To me, religion = dogma. It&#39;s a set of beliefs and practices and devotions that lead to a higher grace or state of being. It&#39;s something you join, but also somethng you believe.<br/>
<br/>
This is from the UU website: <br/>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
At a Unitarian Universalist worship service or meeting, you are likely to find members whose positions on faith may be derived from a variety of religious beliefs: Jewish, Christian, Buddhist, naturist, atheist, or agnostic. Members might tell you that they are religious humanists, liberal Christians, or world religionists.<br/>
<br/>
All these people, and others who label their beliefs still differently, are faithful Unitarian Universalists committed to the practice of free religion. We worship, sing, play, study, teach, and work for social justice together as congregations-all the while remaining strong in our individual convictions.<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
So are they the religion or are they derived from a variety of religious beliefs? Are they the sandwich or the deli or are they just the dining room, the place to enjoy the sandwich you&#39;ve made? The UU to me is a safe place for people of varying beliefs to join together, but the UU itself is not a religion in and of itself. Of course I could be very, very wrong. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I looked up the definition of religion and they don&#39;t mention dogma, so I guess maybe that&#39;s my interpretation (or baggage). This last entry made me smile though.<br/>
<br/>
   4.  A cause, principle, or activity pursued with zeal or conscientious devotion.<br/>
 <br/>
Uh oh. The religion of unschooling?! Aaaaaack!! I hope not. This is a personal journey for sure.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2108584331">&lt;&lt; The religion of unschooling?! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The only way I&#39;ve been able to describe how my dh & I got to unschooling has<br/>
been to compare it to a &quot;religious conversion&quot;.  We attended an unschooling<br/>
conference in May 2000 (Rethinking Education) even though I was sure &quot;I&quot;<br/>
would never homeschool my kids (much less unschool, whatever that was).  We<br/>
were converted that weekend & have never looked back.  We were even (and<br/>
sometimes still are) quite evangelical about it! LOL<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
A friend of ours, a father of 5 yr old twin boys, has asked for a<br/>
recommendation on the one best unschooling book.  We have so many good ones,<br/>
we haven&#39;t been able to pick &quot;THE ONE&quot; book.  <br/>

For Radical unschooling, I would recommend Rue Kream&#39;s new book,<br/>
_Parenting a Free Child, an Unschooled Life_ It looks at unschooling as it touches all parts of our lives.<br/>
