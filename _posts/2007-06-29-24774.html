<div id="ygrps-yiv-1487197205">I know this is for unschooling, but I am hoping I can ask this question for  <br/>
a friend. I have a friend that lives in Rochester, Minnesota and she is a <br/>
single  parent that MUST work. She needs to rely on daycare for her little girl, <br/>
who is  3, I think (no more than 4 and over 2, lol). She is a free spirit in <br/>
many ways  and is really interested in the unschooling philosophy and is a warm, <br/>
 gentle mama. She HATES the daycare she is in how, and I was hoping that <br/>
perhaps  someone might know of a good place that could be recommended to her. This <br/>
child  is given time outs (she dissaproves of that idea), isn&#39;t &quot;allowed&quot; to <br/>
wear her  new undies (the gal just learned to use the toilet and was proud of <br/>
herself, but  now refuses to wear the undies at home to, because the day care <br/>
teacher said she  can&#39;t), isn&#39;t even allowed water when she is thirsty, only <br/>
as designated  times...it&#39;s inane! She wants to take her out and have her go <br/>
elsewhere, but is  really struggling financially, can&#39;t take time off to go to <br/>
each place...and  she&#39;s rather isolated - no network of friends and support, <br/>
really - not for  this, that is. If anyone can suggest anything, would you <br/>
please? Feel free to  keep it off the list, since it&#39;s not a homeschooling or <br/>
unschooling question. I  just knew that you folks here are full of great info and <br/>
ideas and thought I&#39;d  toss it out here for ya&#39;ll to mull over. :)<br/>

Thanks! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1755135608">I will ask around here but I HATE daycares :(<br/>
All the people I know that use them are very far from being AP or unschoolers ( or just plain respectful of their kids) so even if they like their daycare provider it does not mean they will be any better but I will ask <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think I would find a local LLL chapter and try to find an AP-type <br/>
mamma who might benefit from providing a loving space for your <br/>
friend&#39;s daughter during the day.  When my son was little, we had <br/>
some friends who did just that to bring in much needed income.  And, <br/>
I would watch my friends&#39; kids cooperatively, knowing that if I every <br/>
needed somebody to be with Liam (which I never did, but it was good <br/>
to know) there would be a like-minded mamma taking care of him.  A <br/>
good (not foolproof but good) way to spot a potential candidate would <br/>
be somebody who nurses her toddler or older child!  In fact, there <br/>
might already by somebody there who is known in the LLL group to be <br/>
open to this kind of arrangement.  I personally would stay away from <br/>
licensed-type daycare providers anyway for exactly the reasons you <br/>
outlined in your message.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that helps!!<br/>
