<div id="ygrps-yiv-456232448">I have a 9 year old son that is having a really hard time right now. <br/>
It seems that ever since he was born life has been a struggle for him.<br/>
 He hasn&#39;t developed coping mechanisms like other children and has<br/>
displayed numerous signs of sensory integration problems.  The reason<br/>
we started homeschooling was because public school had become nearly<br/>
impossible for him.  He is bright and very smart, but hyper beyond<br/>
belief!  Since he was young he has always seemed to have an issue with<br/>
being asked not to do something, regardless of his safety.  At one<br/>
point in time, my husband said to me, why can&#39;t he do something or<br/>
other and I responded with a &quot;I really don&#39;t think he can&quot;.  That one<br/>
statement was somewhere at the beginning of our unschooling journey. <br/>
I started to understand him more, and who he is.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking for insight into how to help him get along.  The last few<br/>
weeks (probably more), have been hell for him.  He can&#39;t seem to get<br/>
along with his brother no matter matter what I do.  (I&#39;m usually very<br/>
good at helping them work out their differences.)  His anxiety is at<br/>
an all time high, he is the most sensitive I have seen him in a long<br/>
time.  (not just emotional, all senses).  Recently he has joined the<br/>
youth theater and tells he is being yelled at constantly, and hates<br/>
the stage manager.  He is being told to sit alone near the desk<br/>
because he is being disruptive.  Now, I&#39;d like to believe his story<br/>
about him being singled out like that...  but I know from experience<br/>
what is going on.  He doesn&#39;t seem to understand how extreme he can<br/>
be.  While one person is LOUD...  he is 3 times as LOUD.  When a child<br/>
is active he is 2 times as active.  <br/>
<br/>
I cry for him because I know the way people perceive him is many times<br/>
negative, yet I don&#39;t know how to protect him or help him through it.<br/>
 Or help him address the issues so he could have a positive experience<br/>
with the theater.  He wanted nothing more than to be in this play, and<br/>
now he is telling me he wants out, but ONLY because the teacher keeps<br/>
yelling at him.  (he is soooo sensitive) I haven&#39;t talked to the<br/>
director, I want to, but I don&#39;t know what to say.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what to do with him right now.  We have always lived free<br/>
from diagnosis and evaluation because I always thought it was for the<br/>
benefit of the schools.  I wonder if I have made a terrible mistake<br/>
and maybe someone had some answers for me somewhere.  <br/>
<br/>
Someone told me to read the out of sync child for some answers.  Is<br/>
their anyone in a similar situation?  I&#39;m looking for any and all<br/>
experience.  If this post seems emotional its because it is.  I&#39;m sort<br/>
of in the thick of it right now.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1967650273">I have a son just as you described.  I posted about his fighting <br/>
issue and it is because he is so sensitive.  He thinks everyone <br/>
around him is out to get him and they are all mean.  He takes things <br/>
literally.  He is 11yrs old now.  He is a pleasure to raise but there <br/>
are times that his loudness gets to me.  <br/>
Other people including my husband who aren&#39;t around him all hours of <br/>
the day say how loud he is.  But he is just trying to get attention.  <br/>
He wants to be the center of everything.  Theatre is a good choice <br/>
for your son.  I had my son do two plays thru our homeschool group<br/>
(when he is about 7yrs old) and there was tension and stress from <br/>
others when our boy (who by the way got the lead) wouldn&#39;t settle <br/>
down for them.  <br/>
<br/>
Your sweetheart is a free spirit and can not handle the restricions <br/>
society has put on all of us.  He will in time learn to cope.  My son <br/>
says all the time he is not a conformist.  He likes to beat his own <br/>
drum in his own time.(Even if it is too loud or out of tune for us.)  <br/>

learned to express myself (dancing, singing, writing and saying, &quot;Hey! That hurt <br/>

Just you listening to him will help. He knows you hear him and now you&#39;re  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1504853365">Thanks for the ideas/support.  <br/>
<br/>
YOUR RIGHT!  He does take everything literally!  I know many kids this<br/>
age do that, but so much more than that even!  I find myself confused<br/>
sometimes that he doesn&#39;t understand something that comes so simply to<br/>
me.  Pointing this out alone will help me a great deal.<br/>
<br/>
Before we chose to homeschool and ultimately unschool him, we had<br/>
placed him in Karate.  Karate seemed to help him in so many ways.  It<br/>
really helped him find his center and be the child he wants to be.  It<br/>
upsets him so much that he can&#39;t do certain things like other kids(sit<br/>
till, be patient, be quieter).  However, he recently left Karate.  Now<br/>
he is back to wear he was when he was in public school.  He was in<br/>
karate for a few years and he has been out for a few months.  Do you<br/>
think he is &quot;DE-Karating&quot;?  And if so how I can I help him through<br/>
this really difficult time?  He just &quot;loses it&quot; so easily before I<br/>
even can have a chance to help him out.    He seems to be in turmoil<br/>
(inner and outer) day in and day out.  <br/>
<br/>
LOUD!  Yes, he is so incredibly loud its, well...  INCREDIBLE!  I tell<br/>
him often, SAVE IT FOR THE STAGE!  LOL  He will do well.  His director<br/>
thinks so.  I ended up writing her an email, explaining a few things,<br/>
and told her that we could brainstorm some ideas together to help him<br/>
have patience and keep his hands to himself.  LOL<br/>

things with omega-3 fatty acids (fish, walnuts, Coreomega, other things), or<br/>
perhaps also a children&#39;s multivitamin if otherwise he is eating poorly?<br/>
Does he eat things with artificial colors or artificial sweeteners<br/>
(including tooth paste)? Stuff with various preservatives? Does he have<br/>
things with corn syrup in them (perhaps a sulfite allergy which is in corn<br/>
syrup, molasses, grape juice, lemon juice, etc)? Too much other junk food<br/>
with who knows what is in it? And so on. We&#39;ve found the issue with junk<br/>
food is best handled in the supermarket -- not in the home once it is there.<br/>
<br/>
Diet can have a huge impact on behavior. Of course, so can genetics and<br/>
environment. But diet is often easier to change.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a sample link:<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cspinet.org/nah/3_00/diet_behavior.html">http://www.cspinet.org/nah/3_00/diet_behavior.html</a><br/>
&quot;The idea that food can affect children’s behavior gained popularity in the<br/>
early 1970s, when California allergist Benjamin Feingold claimed that the<br/>
behavior of many of his young patients improved when he placed them on<br/>
special diets to treat their food allergies. Feingold blamed food<br/>
additives—especially food dyes—as well as salicylates, which are chemicals<br/>
that occur naturally in most fruits. ...  “Some of these studies<br/>
demonstrated significant improvement in the behavior of children when their<br/>
diets were changed, or deterioration in their behavior when they were given<br/>
food dyes or other offending foods,” says Eugene Arnold, professor emeritus<br/>
of psychiatry at Ohio State University. But in other studies, the<br/>
improvements were small, and in a few there were none. ... In some of the<br/>
nine studies on children with typical ADHD, the behavior of kids who were<br/>
put on an additive-free diet returned to normal (as rated by their parents<br/>
or teachers). But don’t expect miracles. ”Parents who are looking for a<br/>
magic bullet may be frustrated,” says researcher Bonnie Kaplan of the<br/>
University of Calgary, who conducted one of the best studies.3 Changes in<br/>
diet don’t produce as dramatic or consistent results as ADHD drugs. “Diet<br/>
really does make a difference for a relatively small number of kids,”<br/>
concludes Susan Roberts of Tufts University, author of Feeding Your Child<br/>
for Lifelong Health (Bantam Doubleday Dell, 1999). “But until more long-term<br/>
studies are done, we can’t prescribe one diet that will help all of them.”&quot;<br/>

&quot;Does a poor diet lead to crime? Some British researchers think so. They<br/>
studied the behavior of 231 inmates at a maximum-security prison in the U.K.<br/>
Half of the group received daily capsules containing vitamins, minerals and<br/>
essential fatty acids, while the other half took dummy pills. Antisocial<br/>
behavior among inmates was recorded before and during the trial. The<br/>
supplement group broke prison rules 25 percent less than those on the<br/>
placebo. The greatest reduction was for serious offenses--instances of<br/>
fighting, assaulting guards or taking hostages dropped 37 percent. There<br/>
was, however, no significant change in the control group. Lead scientist<br/>
Bernard Gesch, a physiology researcher at Oxford University, wasn&#39;t<br/>
surprised by the findings, published in the British Journal of Psychiatry. A<br/>
former probation officer, Gesch once gave supplements to young delinquents<br/>
under his watch and noticed an improvement in their behavior. That<br/>
experience helped shape his later research. &quot;Nutrition as a causal factor in<br/>
antisocial behavior is so simple it&#39;s been overlooked,&quot; he says. &quot;We think<br/>
of behavior completely as a matter of free will.&quot;&quot;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Just to back up this point for what a personal anecdote is worth, my wife<br/>
has suffered from terrible and frequent migraines for twenty or more years;<br/>
this has cost us many many thousands of dollars for pills and been a big<br/>
worry with increasing dosages (which doctors suggest is needed as they said<br/>
approaching menopause leads to more and worse  migraines). She has seen<br/>
multiple doctors for this (with little good advice, beyond prescriptions).<br/>
She finally cut all corn syrup out of her diet -- which was difficult since<br/>
it is often in stuff like bread and ketchup. She had also dropped over the<br/>
years other things, like raisins, shrimp, and so on which have sulfites<br/>
(corn syrup can have sulfites added too as a preservative). Guess what --<br/>
migraine free for many weeks (except when she had two following chicken<br/>
nuggets and a soda from Wendy&#39;s). The longest time free of headaches in her<br/>
life. This is like a miracle in her life!  My wife had also know about the<br/>
corn syrup and sulfite connection for years but discounted it (she was<br/>
avoiding diet soda because of the negative effect of those diet additives).<br/>
And now that she is headache free as a baseline, it will be easier to see<br/>
what does and does not cause headaches. Now, I&#39;m not saying sulfites are an<br/>
issue with your kid (although you might look at food allergies in general).<br/>
Nor am I saying they cause any migraines for someone else. I&#39;m just using<br/>
this as an example of how a seemingly intractable problem which was<br/>
continually getting worse suddenly went away with a change of diet. By the<br/>
way, Al Gore (remember him?) tried to ban added sulfites in the USA in 1985<br/>
but was prevented by industry lobbies. What a difference that ban might have<br/>
made in our lives. Added sulfites are banned in some parts of Europe. Still,<br/>
they may be fine for most people. And even in my wife&#39;s case, it may be some<br/>
other issue related to high fructose corn syrup instead of sulfites (corn<br/>
syrup may interfere with the body&#39;s sugar regulation and damage the pancreas<br/>
in ways different from plain table sugar),<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_fructose_corn_syrup">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_fructose_corn_syrup</a><br/>
and there may be other triggers as well (some of which we have been working<br/>
to reduce for years). There are also things which are triggers for other<br/>
people (like MSG, chocolate, perhaps caffeine) which don&#39;t seem to  be much<br/>
of a problem for her. But in any case, things have improved miraculously<br/>
with a change in diet -- including my wife&#39;s (and the rest of the family&#39;s)<br/>
general level of happiness and also her ability to deal with stress (since<br/>
the social stress -&gt; painful headache connection seems to have been broken).<br/>
She has also found she has less craving for carbohydrates without the corn<br/>
syrup in her diet, and less swings of blood sugar which result in mood<br/>
swings (since both adults and kids tend to get cranky when their blood sugar<br/>
drops).<br/>
<br/>
The blog of someone with more serious food alleries to sulfites:<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.leapscout.com/">http://www.leapscout.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d suggest, encourage your child to try a simplified diet for a while (no<br/>
processed stuff like lunchmeats or regular hot dogs or high fructose corn<br/>
syrup). Just eat, for one possibility, rice, beans, water, selected fruit,<br/>
vegetables, etc. and see if it helps. Frozen vegetables may be easiest to<br/>
use -- our child will even eat frozen small vegetables (peas, carrot pieces)<br/>
while still frozen (in fact, insists on it). It may also take a weeks to see<br/>
a change while the rest of the additives get out of his system. At the very<br/>
worst, eating a good balanced diet for a few weeks is unlikely to hurt him.<br/>
If it does, consider if something specific in the simplified diet<br/>
(especially specific fruits) may also be a problem. Ideally, if your budget<br/>
can afford it, try organic foods as well (although they are often more<br/>
expensive). Timing may be another issue -- perhaps your kids simply gets<br/>
cranky in when his blood sugar drops and that coincides with the time of the<br/>
drama lessons? Eliminating high fructose corn syrup may help with any<br/>
fluctuating blood sugar levels as well. Ideally you could talk with a doctor<br/>
who knows a lot about food and healing (a good nutritionist?) first -- there<br/>
could always be other underlying medical issues as well.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, if your kid is already non-cooperative, changing diet may be<br/>
yet another struggle (e.g. no McDonald&#39;s for a kid who lives on it might be<br/>
a shocker, and may try even further your own ability to cope). And as one of<br/>
the links above suggested, there may be no guarantee of success -- diet and<br/>
food allergies can be very child specific. I&#39;m sure many people here may<br/>
have advice on how to make a diet change in an unschooling sort of way<br/>
(other than by &quot;do it my way&quot;), including having your child participate in<br/>
the dietary change. But I&#39;d once again emphasize the point that most of the<br/>
&quot;battle of the bulge&quot; (both for kids and adults) is best fought in the<br/>
supermarket, not on the home front. :-) I&#39;m sure lots of people here would<br/>
have advice on avoiding a battle even at the supermarket.<br/>
<br/>
If a diet change seems like a complete impossibility, at the very least keep<br/>
a diet diary yourself for your child (or better, help him do it for himself)<br/>
-- and see if there is any obvious connection between behavior and specific<br/>
diet. For example, it might help you track down if his behavior is more<br/>
problematic an hour or a day after your kid has soda pop at McDonalds.<br/>
<br/>
Now you might hear a lot of people saying -- my kid eats whatever they want<br/>
and it includes McDonald&#39;s and lots of soda pop and they are perfectly fine<br/>
-- and that may well be true, for *their* kid. Mailing lists also tend to be<br/>
self-selecting, in that if a particular approach doesn&#39;t work, people just<br/>
drop off and you hear mainly the success stories. Most people can eat<br/>
sulfites too (like in red wine or raisins) without crushing headaches -- but<br/>
my wife can&#39;t. To think, she used to start every day for years with Raisin<br/>
Bran. :-( Again, once you have identified a food issue, then people here<br/>
will have lots of advice on dealing with it -- including the approach which<br/>
has been outlined here of making sure the kid knows about it and then<br/>
dealing with consequences of their choice to themselves and others.<br/>
Sometimes my wife might chose to have red wine even knowing it will give her<br/>
a migraine later. Although since a food choice may affect the entire family<br/>
(e.g. siblings fighting), the issue may be more complex than a kid just<br/>
harming themselves by bad choices, which gets back to an idea IO read<br/>
somewhere that families can be parent-centered (do as I say), kid-centered<br/>
(whatever you want, dear), or family-centered (which entails a much more<br/>
complex balancing act of various interests by both kids and adults).<br/>
<br/>
Now your son may already be eating really well, and may in the end have no<br/>
food allergies -- if so, please forgive the suggestion. The issues you<br/>
struggle with may well be genetic or environmental (poor drama coaching) or<br/>
just plain old personality or in relation to the play or his brother, just a<br/>
phase or just in relation to a specific incident. But if you have already<br/>
tried everything else, and are at your wit&#39;s end, then diet may be worth<br/>
looking into as something that might help, even just a bit. There remains a<br/>
lot of truth to &quot;you are what you eat&quot;, and sometimes the issue of free will<br/>
is in deciding what we want to be by deciding what we want to eat.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1497087865">Thanks for the info!  Funny thing, we were Feingolders for awhile.  We are a<br/>
gluten free family.  That&#39;s what seems to make him tick the most.  I have to<br/>
laugh, because we NEVER eat lunch meats!  GROSS!  LOL  We rarely if ever by<br/>
anything with preservatives, colors, and anything not organic.  The last<br/>
corn syrup went out with the ketchup.  We now buy natural ketchup.  While it<br/>
has taxed our budget incredibly it has helped ALL OF US incredibly to feel<br/>
good.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Gluten free is rarely a struggle for us, until he gets in these moods.  Then<br/>
he starts craving what he calls &quot;regular pizza&quot; and &quot;regular cookies&quot; but he<br/>
does truly understand why we eat the way we do.  And sometimes tells others<br/>
about it.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Afew unschoolers don&#39;t understand why I have to regulate diet.  but the day<br/>
my child almost jumped off a ride at the county fair while it was going full<br/>
speed, gave me enough of a scare to realize that something was wrong.  After<br/>
trial and error we found how he lost all sense of personal safety.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>

Thanks for all the links.  it will be a nice refresher!  And it will help me<br/>
see if we are still on track.  <br/>

Diet can have a huge impact on behavior. Of course, so can genetics and<br/>

http://www.cspinet. &lt;http://www.cspinet.org/nah/3_00/diet_behavior.html&gt;<br/>
org/nah/3_00/diet_behavior.html<br/>
&quot;The idea that food can affect children&#39;s behavior gained popularity in the<br/>
early 1970s, when California allergist Benjamin Feingold claimed that the<br/>
behavior of many of his young patients improved when he placed them on<br/>
special diets to treat their food allergies. Feingold blamed food<br/>
additives-especially food dyes-as well as salicylates, which are chemicals<br/>
that occur naturally in most fruits. ... &quot;Some of these studies<br/>
demonstrated significant improvement in the behavior of children when their<br/>
diets were changed, or deterioration in their behavior when they were given<br/>
food dyes or other offending foods,&quot; says Eugene Arnold, professor emeritus<br/>
of psychiatry at Ohio State University. But in other studies, the<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-117638412">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you have found some things to try. I also have a son, who can easily be described as more. What I have come to realize is me being connected to him is his greatest source of control. He and I work together in partnership. Also, my guy goes through cycles and about every 6 months he completely disintegrates for awhile and then it seems he copes again. During these super rough times, I simply life, cut out social situations that are putting him over, and reconnect as best as I can. If my guy were in a play, I would be right there the entire rehersal, so he can check in and be near me, bounce holding my hands, dance with me in open space as needed. Is it possible for you to be available to him. My guy travels with his swim team and I go, no matter what. He lost it once in a very crowded airport far from home, was teased, was hot, was uncomfortable, was tired, was asked to wait. I just cringe thinking how he would have been if I wasn&#39;t available to help him move away, fi<br/>
nd fresh air and a more quiet place. My son and I have singnals, a guick lets go, means, no matter what, he needs space from the crowd or else. We check in, he vents, we move forward. Water, fresh air and space are his greatest comforts.<br/>
<br/>
I have 3 children, my son is my middle child. It does take more energy to be his center, but the alternative is everyone near suffers when he suffers. It&#39;s second nature now, to be his partner and I see he is able to cope better each year. He&#39;ll be 11 next month.<br/>
<br/>
I also like the books The Highly Sensitive Child, The Explosive Child ( great for exploring triggers), Raising Our Children, Raising Ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
Give him hugs alot.<br/>

He DOES NOT want me to go with him.  He is very independent and would like<br/>
to be successful on his own.  His theater teacher has mentioned to me know<br/>
that her 2 children are very much like him!  That gave me a lot of comfort.<br/>
She is very understanding and wants to see him succeed as much as I do!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We are going to brainstorm some ideas on something to fiddle with while he<br/>
waits and ways to center himself without me there.  Any thoughts?  Gameboys<br/>
are out unless we can think of nothing else.  The Gameboys have apparently<br/>
caused problems in the past with all the kids sort of arguing over turns.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Also, the 6 months on and 6 months off thing- I have heard this from other<br/>
people and it rings somewhat true here.  So weird!  I&#39;ve read the Explosive<br/>
Child.  GREAT read!  Looks like I&#39;ll be reading a lot more in 2008. :-)<br/>

&quot;Sensory Integration Dysfunction&quot; and diet:<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sensorynation.com/interventions.html">http://www.sensorynation.com/interventions.html</a><br/>
<br/>
See the section on that web page labeled &quot;Nutritional Therapy&quot;. Several<br/>
different nutritional approaches listed there, including:<br/>
* Essential Fatty Acid Supplementation,<br/>
* Enzyme Supplementation,<br/>
* Feingold Diet, and<br/>
* Gluten-free/Casein-free Diet.<br/>
<br/>
An excerpt from the page:<br/>
&quot;&quot;&quot;<br/>
Essential Fatty Acid Supplementation: The Durham Research Initiative in<br/>
cooperation with the Food and Behavior Research Institute in the United<br/>
Kingdom asserts that an &quot;increasing body of research is showing that quality<br/>
long chain fatty acids could have real benefits for a range of learning and<br/>
behavioural conditions. About 20% of the dry weight of the brain and some<br/>
30% of the retina are made from these elements.&quot; Learn more...<br/>
<br/>
Enzyme Supplementation: Many SIDKids exhibit digestive difficulties, which<br/>
may be aided by the use of enzyme therapy. Enzymes help break down food<br/>
proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids and can increase the breakdown of all<br/>
food proteins, carbohydrates, starches, and fats. Enzyme advocates postulate<br/>
that the supplementation of enzymes can eliminate the need to avoid<br/>
casein/gluten-based foods altogether. In fact. there are now enzymes<br/>
specifically designed to aid in the digestion of gluten and casein from<br/>
companies such as Kirkman Labs. Learn more...<br/>
<br/>
Feingold Diet: According to the Feingold Association of the United States,<br/>
&quot;The Feingold Program itself is a test to determine if certain foods or food<br/>
additives are triggering particular symptoms. It is basically the way people<br/>
used to eat before &quot;hyperactivity&quot; became a household word, and before<br/>
asthma and chronic ear infections became so very common. Used originally as<br/>
a diet for allergies, improvement in behavior and attention was first<br/>
noticed as a &quot;side effect.&quot; Learn more...<br/>
<br/>
Gluten-free/Casein-free Diet: This approach involves the total elimination<br/>
of all foods containing gluten and casein. While designed for the autistic<br/>
child, many families have found great improvements for their non-autistic<br/>
SIDKids. And fortunately, many gluten-free and casein-free foods are now<br/>
commercially available. Learn more...<br/>
&quot;&quot;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There are other non-nutritional interventions listed there as well.<br/>
<br/>
Not saying any of these will help for sure in your particular situation;<br/>
just another possibility to explore.<br/>

I wonder, just how much the food preferences, the sensitivities and the  <br/>
extra dicernment of foods is a biological part of all of this? <br/>

I saved that link for myself - thanks! <br/>

son to tat so he would have something to do with his<br/>
hands but I&#39;ve never found someone to teach him. He<br/>
does now carry a small container that holds the rings<br/>
and the little pliers he uses to make chain maille. It<br/>
fits in his pocket and just pulls it out and works<br/>
wherever he is. I still love the tatting idea<br/>
though... How about knot tying? We&#39;ve done that too,<br/>
nothing wrong with a piece of string in his pocket. <br/>

String figures! If you don&#39;t know someone hwo can teach him there are some <br/>
great books out there. It&#39;s portable, engaging, and tends to draw in others to <br/>
talk to boot. Patrick carried a string loop everywhere for a year or two. <br/>
