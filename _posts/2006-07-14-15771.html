<div id="ygrps-yiv-1763364824">Vijay posted this at AU today (where a food discussion is going on<br/>
simultaneously) and I thought she covered just about EVERYTHING<br/>
relating to RU and food. It&#39;s great! Here ya go:<br/>
<br/>
I have a crazy week coming up, and probably won&#39;t be able to post much,<br/>
but a few thoughts popped into my head and I just wanted to share them<br/>
before I try to disappear for a few days. It&#39;s hard to leave! This list<br/>
is so compelling. There has been a food discussion at UB *and* here and<br/>
I can&#39;t keep it all straight, so please forgive if this is a kind of<br/>
non sequitur. Anyone who belongs to both and thinks this should be<br/>
posted at UB can go ahead and put it up there. I&#39;m sorry this got so<br/>
long, I kept trying to revise it and pare it down, but kept adding<br/>
stuff instead. :-)<br/>
<br/>
The whole food issue for me comes down to trust. People don&#39;t believe<br/>
that a 3 y.o. (or younger, since we&#39;ve basically been unfooding almost<br/>
right from the beginning) can be in charge of their own food choices<br/>
because they don&#39;t know about carbs, protein, good fats, bad fats,<br/>
fiber, cholesterol, atherosclerosis, etc. But I have seen first hand<br/>
that even though my DD is drawn to chips and cookies sometimes, she<br/>
consumes them in moderation even though she is not limited by me.<br/>
<br/>
Even if she *only* wanted to eat chips and cookies we&#39;d find a way to<br/>
make that work. It would cut into our current food and time budget a<br/>
bit to make and buy healthier versions, but if DD was even more<br/>
selective than she is now about food we&#39;d work it out without<br/>
compromising our RU beliefs. We&#39;d drive the 45 minutes to Whole Foods<br/>
to buy the premade foods and the ingredients we needed. It would cost a<br/>
lot more, and it would be a lot more trouble, but I&#39;m not about to let<br/>
my kid subsist solely on the brands of chips and cookies that we can<br/>
buy at our local supermarket. That would be irresponsible. Luckily for<br/>
me, that&#39;s not what she wants.<br/>
<br/>
If we never went to the store together, or if we never went to<br/>
restaurants together she might never ask for fries or chips, but she<br/>
goes wherever I go. I&#39;m not going to keep her in an artificial bubble<br/>
at home. I want her to experience life as fully as possible (time,<br/>
budget, and other restrictions permitting). She lives a healthy active<br/>
lifestyle, stays well hydrated, and is basically a very happy healthy<br/>
kid. Someday when they serve &quot;monkey platters&quot; at restaurants for kids<br/>
that&#39;s what I&#39;ll order, but for now fries are just about the only thing<br/>
they serve that she will eat. We of course always put bits of our<br/>
chicken, fish, veggies, etc. on her plate but she doesn&#39;t eat them.<br/>
<br/>
In case my point is getting lost, let me stress what is important to<br/>
me. That she go through life maintaining the healthy active lifestyle<br/>
that she has now, learns to trust herself in the food choices that she<br/>
makes, as in everything else. And that she trusts me to be her partner,<br/>
not her boss. That she doesn&#39;t feel sneaky or guilty about &quot;bad&quot; foods.<br/>
That she looks at food as what it is: fuel that keeps us going, that<br/>
can be enjoyed, but isn&#39;t the end all and be all of the universe. You<br/>
can enjoy growing food, preparing food, eating food, and the act of<br/>
&quot;breaking bread&quot; with your friends and family. And we enjoy all of<br/>
those things! But food is not love. Food is not a way to stuff your<br/>
shame and low self esteem down inside. Food should not be used as a way<br/>
to numb yourself to whatever stress and pain life sends you.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter will never have to know the shame of having to stuff her<br/>
chunky self into an unflattering gym uniform and struggle to take her<br/>
body -- a body that is forced to sit in a chair, hour after hour, day<br/>
after day -- and put it through ridiculous paces. Climbing ropes is FUN<br/>
for her because she&#39;s not being forced to do it while 30 other kids<br/>
point and laugh. Running is done for the sheer joy of it, not because<br/>
you are being tested on how fast you can run the mile.<br/>
<br/>
I trust that my daughter will learn more and more about food as she<br/>
matures, and it may not be about calorie counts, or grams of fat. It<br/>
may simply be based on how different foods taste, and how they make her<br/>
feel. How wonderful if I can give that gift to her by merely butting<br/>
out! For her to be able to maintain a healthy weight without dieting or<br/>
obsessing about grams of carbs! For her to feel good about herself even<br/>
with a few extra pounds (though she seems very lean now) and not<br/>
develop anorexia or bulemia as so many young girls do.<br/>
<br/>
Controlling what she eats now, and then having her suddenly be on her<br/>
own without me there to police what she eats doesn&#39;t seem like the<br/>
right path to me. We all have to find our own way, and this is my<br/>
approach. The trust approach to food. Unfooding always sounds to me<br/>
like &quot;not feeding&quot; so maybe I&#39;ll just coin a new term: &quot;the total trust<br/>
approach to toddler food and nutrition.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Is there an acronym in there? LOL<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t read much about modeling in this discussion, but it&#39;s so<br/>
important. These unschooled kids aren&#39;t making decisions in a vacuum.<br/>
Actually just writing that, I think someone *did* say it, but it bears<br/>
repeating. DD sees me eating fruit, veggies, chicken, salad and other<br/>
healthy stuff and she is always offered whatever I am eating, whatever<br/>
DH is eating. She is simply not interested in many fruits or vegetables<br/>
now. She likes blueberries and that&#39;s fine with me. She likes peas, and<br/>
carrots, and that&#39;s fine too. She doesn&#39;t have to eat lettuce or<br/>
bananas to be healthy.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not like she NEVER eats healthy stuff, she just picks and chooses<br/>
and some of it is healthy and some if it is a little on the sugary or<br/>
salty side. That&#39;s okay with me! She often asks for new foods and<br/>
doesn&#39;t eat them, but the tenth time I put it in front of her, she will<br/>
often try it and then ask for more. She did this with strawberries. She<br/>
saw me buy them, she saw me wash them and slice them for Violet and for<br/>
myself and DH. She was often offered some and always declined. Then she<br/>
asked for some and didn&#39;t eat them. This happened several times. Each<br/>
time she asked I just put a few on her plate with no expectations.<br/>
Maybe the 5th or 6th time, she ate them and asked for more. That&#39;s an<br/>
approach anyone can try and see what happens. When they ask for 3<br/>
things, just always add a 4th, and just keep doing it with the same 4th<br/>
food until they eventually try it. You don&#39;t even have to say anything!<br/>
<br/>
Mealtime right now looks like this: if DD knows what she wants, cool.<br/>
But if she doesn&#39;t, I take one of those plates with the partitions and<br/>
I put something protein-y like meat or pasta or cheese, some kind of<br/>
veggie that she likes, and some kind of fruit that she likes. Then I&#39;ll<br/>
add one more thing that she normally doesn&#39;t like (I don&#39;t know, beans<br/>
or something) that I&#39;d like her to try and I put the whole thing in<br/>
front of her. If she just eats one food, or just a few bites of each,<br/>
fine, the rest goes back in the fridge for later. No stress, no bribes,<br/>
no ultimatums, no pressure, no guilt. Just here you go. All done? Okay,<br/>
let&#39;s go play. Simple, no?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll buy cookies or make cookies, usually oatmeal, and when we run out<br/>
I just tell her we&#39;ll put it on the list (if I&#39;m not feeling up to<br/>
making them) and she&#39;s satisfied with that because she knows I mean it.<br/>
Same with popsicles. If we run out of her favorite we go down the line<br/>
until we&#39;re working on the least favorite kinds and she knows when we<br/>
go to the store soon her faves will be replenished. Trust. I don&#39;t hold<br/>
up cookies or popsicles as being a reward, or a &quot;naughty&quot; food, or<br/>
something that she can&#39;t eat for breakfast, or only after she finishes<br/>
her peas.<br/>
<br/>
After studying journalism and biology as an undergrad, I was *this<br/>
close* to going to grad school for nutrition science. I was going to<br/>
bash my brains in trying to find the TRUTH in all of the half-truths,<br/>
propaganda, and lies out there when it comes to diet and nutrition, and<br/>
then translate all of the science-speak into normal terms for normal<br/>
people. For rates that the average person can actually afford! I<br/>
decided against it only because I hate school! It&#39;s so expensive, and<br/>
all they do is set you loose with a textbook and then test you on it.<br/>
Oh, and boring lectures that are basically the same info as the text.<br/>
For this they want tens of thousands of dollars? Hmpf. Maybe it&#39;s<br/>
different at the grad level but I&#39;ll never know!<br/>
<br/>
The whole cigarette analogy is absurd, IMO. I can&#39;t remember if it was<br/>
here or at UB or both, but someone basically asked would you put a bowl<br/>
of cigarettes out for your kids to smoke and equating that to parents<br/>
who give their kids &quot;junk&quot; foods. Smoking is a combination of modeling,<br/>
rebellion, and addiction. Kids whose parents smoke are more likely to<br/>
smoke. Kids who are more susceptible to peer pressure are more likely<br/>
to smoke to fit in with the &quot;cool&quot; kids. Kids who want to say to their<br/>
controlling parents, &quot;FU! This is my body and I&#39;m going to desecrate it<br/>
just to piss you off!&quot; are more likely to smoke. Kids who try smoking a<br/>
few times for whatever reason, curiosity or whatever, who have<br/>
addictive personalities are more likely to keep smoking. There are so<br/>
many factors at work here that have nothing whatsoever to do with food<br/>
that it makes no sense to compare the two. Especially since most of the<br/>
factors I named above don&#39;t even apply to most unschooled kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1729129648">That&#39;s really a great post !<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t read the whole thread, so please excuse me if I&#39;m <br/>
redundant.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a child, I was really a picky eater : I didn&#39;t like <br/>
fruits or vegetables ... I liked potatoes, raw carrots, yaourt, milk <br/>
(very much), meal (a bit) and, above all, chocolate. I don&#39;t know <br/>
why, my parents didn&#39;t force me to eat (though they did with my <br/>
eldest sisters). Sometimes they forced me to taste, but I never had <br/>
to finish my plate, and my father thought that a child always <br/>
deserved a desert if she wants one, no matter what she ate before ...<br/>
<br/>
I became more curious with food as I was growing up, and now I eat <br/>
pretty much everything (still don&#39;t like fruits, though, except for <br/>
a few of them) and I am always willingly to taste something new <br/>
(there are a few &quot;textures&quot; that repell me). I feel good (don&#39;t know <br/>
how to say that : my body and I are good buddies)<br/>
<br/>
Because of my example, my sister is very relaxed with food issues <br/>
and has never forced her daughters to eat anything. She even kept <br/>
plenty of sweets at home with no restricted access and for a while <br/>
my younger niece really ate a lot of them and not very much of <br/>
anything else ... Her elder sister eats tons of fruits and don&#39;t <br/>
like sweets, except for chocolate (genetics ;)). They are both very <br/>
healthy girls. <br/>
<br/>
Just my testimony, for what it&#39;s worth ...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-115618552">**The whole cigarette analogy is absurd, IMO. I can&#39;t remember if it was<br/>

who give their kids &quot;junk&quot; foods.**<br/>
<br/>
I think I came up with an analogy that&#39;s less extreme and fits better.<br/>
<br/>
My son just got an iPod, before that he had been listening to songs we<br/>
both like on mine.  When I turn on my iPod after he has been listening<br/>
to it, it&#39;s about four settings louder than I would listen to it.  (It<br/>
doesn&#39;t blast my ears out, but it is noticeably louder than just<br/>
audible.)  There have been recent articles that extended listening<br/>
time from an iPod or other in-the-ears device can cause hearing loss.<br/>
 (And some lawsuits against Apple, I think.)<br/>
<br/>
My husband, 49, is already showing some amount of hearing loss that<br/>
may affect his ability to hold down a job (as a classroom teacher).<br/>
However, his hearing lost is likely not from exposure to loud noise as<br/>
he has never worked at a noisy job and didn&#39;t go to concerts or own a<br/>
stereo as a teen, or listen to loud music as an adult.  So like heart<br/>
disease, some disfunction may just be an inevitable byproduct of age,<br/>
at least for some people.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve discussed with my son (12) the possibility that listening to<br/>
moderately loud music for long periods can damage hearing.  What else<br/>
should I do?  More reseach to figure out more precisely the volume<br/>
levels that can cause trouble?<br/>
<br/>
He may listen 3 plus hours a day, probably less than enough to cause<br/>
&quot;overuse&quot; problems.  Music has mood-elevatng effects and he sings and<br/>
dances when listening.  One can&#39;t say that the health effects of the<br/>
iPod are all negative, because of these positives.<br/>
<br/>
If I give too many reminders about volume, that&#39;s gonna backfire,<br/>
possibly?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 Hard to say which way...<br/>
<br/>
  We have some more direct loudness issues: Cameron&#39;s in a few bands! <br/>
&lt;G&gt; Long-time drummers are notoriously deaf or hard of hearing!<br/>
<br/>
  My brother-in-law is an EN&T doc and knew that Cameron was playing the <br/>
drums. For his birthday this year, Skip had Cam come in for an ear exam <br/>
and to be fitted for some special musicians&#39; ear plugs as a birthday <br/>
present. Cameron also got an earful of how sensitive our ears actually <br/>
are with charts and photos and such.<br/>
<br/>
  He *always* performs with those ear plugs in. He carries them with him <br/>
always---just like his drum sticks.<br/>
<br/>
  He&#39;s been asking me for a set of practice ear phones which I finally <br/>
bought this past week. They&#39;re *much* bigger than the ear plugs and <br/>
have some other benefits. They arrived yesterday---and I haven&#39;t seen <br/>
him that happy in a while! &lt;bwg&gt; He&#39;ll wear those every time he <br/>
practices.<br/>
<br/>
  But he&#39;s funny about his ears. I always listen to my music full <br/>
blast---in the car especially when no one else is with me. As a child, <br/>
I *loved* to be home alone with my stereo turned all the way up! &lt;G&gt; <br/>
And three hours for me was nothing! I was just getting warmed up! &lt;G&gt; <br/>
But we didn&#39;t have iPods. They&#39;re actually IN the ears! Cam&#39;s iPod is <br/>
always on low, and his stereo is never loud in his room.<br/>
<br/>
  I told him yesterday that he was a bit unusual in that he actually <br/>
*wanted* to protect his ears. At his age, most kids are sitting as <br/>
close to the speakers as they can! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

what they could be that many set their sites as low as possible. They <br/>

There are  loads of choices in Ipod speakers. We have a set for Zack&#39;s room. We also have some sort of electronic contraption that enables the iPod to play through the car stereo.<br/>
I don&#39;t think the ear buds are even used anymore.<br/>

like the old foam covered head phones from my college days, but they<br/>
have these ear pieces that slip over the ear rather than a wire over<br/>
the head.  They are quite comfortable and keep the music out of the<br/>
ear.  I think it has to do with the way their ears are formed.  I<br/>
actually like ear buds, but the kids say they just don&#39;t fit their<br/>
ears well and feel &quot;funny&quot;  My my blue tooth headphone/speaker for my<br/>
cell phone, wich I call Lt. Uhuru after Star Trek TOS has a similar<br/>
ear clippy thing like their headphones.  They are a bit more spendy,<br/>
like $12-$20 but the kids like them so much better.<br/>

I have a huge amount of unread digests to read, that I&#39;ve kept specifically<br/>
to read this topic on food.  I hope I&#39;m not asking something already<br/>
covered, and I probably will sound absurd, in my ignorance.<br/>
My question - my fear, actually - is that because I AM extremely addicted to<br/>
sugar (like some are addicted to smokes), that I&#39;m modelling somethign<br/>
horrible to my todler and can&#39;t unfood in the way it is *supposed* to be<br/>
done, if that&#39;s even possible.  I&#39;m working on my addiction and getting<br/>
therapy for the underlying issues, and I&#39;m getting better.  I think I will<br/>
be a good food-eating-model soon.  I&#39;ve actually maintained a good history<br/>
of eating healthy in my many years *prior* to parenting, so this is an<br/>
unusually dark period for me in how destructive my food choices have been.<br/>
However, things have gotten way out of hand, the last 2 yrs, due to marital<br/>
stress.  So maybe it&#39;ll be easy to embrace unfooding as my addictions<br/>
crumble.  In the meantime, the fear is getting the best of me and it seems<br/>
inappropriate to openly model my addiction to sugary foods.  What do you all<br/>
think?  Oh, I do *try* to release my fears, and let dd eat by her choice.<br/>
Some days I do well, others I get restrictive.  I&#39;m quite the jelly fish on<br/>
this because of this fear factor.<br/>

food choices than I do - they&#39;ve been unlimited and unguilted. I  <br/>
don&#39;t beat myself up, openly, over my own choices to eat high-fat or  <br/>
high-sugar foods. The kids just accept the way I eat as my food  <br/>
choices, not theirs. So - you might not be able to silence the voice  <br/>
in your head that&#39;s making you feel guilty, but you can keep your own  <br/>
guilt feelings to yourself so that your child doesn&#39;t have to know  <br/>
you&#39;re having food issues.<br/>
<br/>
Just focus on making sure she has lots of good options that are  <br/>
delicious and enticing to her - which I know you already do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1773153819">Yes, that&#39;s reassuring, thanks Pam.  Did you ever have periods - <br/>
especially during their todlerhood - where you *modelled* extremely <br/>
sugary/high fat choices? Becuase although I&#39;m offering healthier <br/>
options & they&#39;re available at her level in the fridge, etc, the more <br/>
open I am about my constant sugar eating, the more she appears to be <br/>
opting for sugary choices, too.  I just worry that this stage in her <br/>
life is particularly crucial in developing sugar addictions (kinda <br/>
like the media thing I mentioned)...  Though my fear is probably <br/>
clouding my judgement on this topic.  <br/>
 <br/>
Was the key to your children&#39;s food choices the attitude you modelled <br/>
(freedom from shame), or the physical choices (lots of high fat/sugary <br/>
foods)- Wouldn&#39;t both end up having an affect on your children&#39;s <br/>
choices?  Or was that just not the case?  Or maybe it differed <br/>
depending on personality, etc.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I will second Pam on this one.  Even with my choices my kids eat a<br/>
much more varied (as in from different food groups) than I do.  I<br/>
think one of the biggest things that I have started doing is listening<br/>
to my body and not always saying yes when I hear food mentioned (sort<br/>
of the opposite of the &quot;unschooling no&quot;).  For instance if my kids ask<br/>
me if I want some pocky instead of instantly saying yes, I will pause<br/>
for a second and evaluate if I am hungry and if I really want pocky.<br/>
Sometimes I do.  Sometimes I realize that I really don&#39;t and will say,<br/>
&quot;I&#39;ll pass for now.  Thanks for offering, though.  Maybe later.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>After childhood, I have always eaten more fatty and sugary stuff than  <br/>
I thought was healthy - and felt guilty about it, yes.<br/>
<br/>
Still do it.<br/>
<br/>
But I have foregone buying a box of cookies and bought great-looking  <br/>
pears, instead, too.<br/>
<br/>
I really do think the key is having lots of good stuff around.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, &quot;I&quot; grew up with almost no processed foods, no soda, no  <br/>
store-bought cookies, etc.  TV dinners came out when I was in  <br/>
elementary school and we got to have one of those on the occasional  <br/>
nights we had a babysitter. I had Oreos at my friend&#39;s house. I don&#39;t  <br/>
remember having chips except at a party. I remember the first time I  <br/>
tasted soda - thought it would burn my tongue off. My dad would go  <br/>
out and get fresh-made donuts - maybe once every 6 months. But  <br/>
otherwise, any sweets we had were homemade by my mom - oatmeal  <br/>
cookies was typical - and not too often. Sweets were definitely  <br/>
restricted and came out only on special occasions. Or, it is more  <br/>
accurate to say that being allowed to have sweets WAS automatically a  <br/>
special occasion.<br/>
<br/>
I lived on donuts, Doritos and Coca-Cola in high school. I had no  <br/>
CLUE about food - what would make me feel good, etc. I was completely  <br/>
and totally out of touch with my own body&#39;s food needs.<br/>
<br/>
So - I&#39;m not sure my mother&#39;s modeling of making and eating only  <br/>
nutritious foods was a great idea. Left me a little helpless in the  <br/>
face of Doritos and Coke.<br/>
