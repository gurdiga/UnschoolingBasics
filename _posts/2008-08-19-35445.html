<div id="ygrps-yiv-1015108197">Ugh!  If I still lived in Michigan I wouldn&#39;t even have to put those subjects together in a title!  <br/>
We have moved to PA where they expect us to keep records.  I would be fine if it was just a <br/>
book list (need a ream of paper for 3 kids worth of books/year).....but they want us to keep <br/>
track of the time.  (180 days and 990 hrs?).<br/>
<br/>
Are their any PA unschoolers here who could help me out or just reassure me that CPS (or <br/>
whatever they call it here) isn&#39;t going to knock on my door and say I am not in compliance <br/>
(ugh what a yucky word) with their laws....I am wondering if any of you have a special form or <br/>
way of keeping records that can show the time, etc. needed?<br/>
<br/>
I did download the form from this group, but I am not sure that would work...or how to <br/>
assign a time to each item.  Any thoughts would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if you don&#39;t mind I am going to go outside and watch as my youngest 2 continue the <br/>
game of &quot;Calvin Ball&quot; they started over 2 hrs ago... :)  Maybe it will rain and we can dance <br/>
around for a bit.....lol  or maybe we should do a rain dance now so I don&#39;t have to water the <br/>
garden later.  hee hee<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-632946399">I also live in PA and in a difficult SD. It is not very hard to comply with<br/>
PA law. I would be happy to chat with you about it if you&#39;d like to email me<br/>
offlist so we don&#39;t take up everyones space with &quot;local&quot; issues.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391016431">Hi Amber -<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in Maryland and belong to an unschooling friendly oversight group<br/>
called The Excelsior Academy (TEA).  The director also does services<br/>
for Pennsylvania and was a wealth of information (as well as<br/>
reassuring).  If you&#39;re interested, here&#39;s the contact info:<br/>
