<div id="ygrps-yiv-1893068532">Hello! I am Natalie, a single mom with an unschooling family; <br/>
myself, Solstice, 8 and Ryan, 4. I&#39;ve been a member for awhile, but <br/>
just recently bought a computer. I&#39;m so excited to be able to <br/>
actually converse with everyone now! <br/>
We have been Unschoolers for a few years, and I am coming up against <br/>
some issues with my youngest son&#39;s other family. He is 4, will be 5 <br/>
in August, and he lives with me during the week, and at his dad&#39;s on <br/>
weekends.<br/>
 Now, this man, he is a person who doesn&#39;t engage in his children&#39;s <br/>
lives the way that I would wish for my son, but he still wants to <br/>
make the decisions about the biggies (healthcare, school, religion) <br/>
There are many many issues, but I will just throw this one out there <br/>
because I feel that it is the root of the situation.<br/>
We broke up July of 2005, and Ryan has been going to his dad&#39;s every <br/>
weekend, except maybe 3 or 4 times his dad was out of town on <br/>
business. Ryan has, from day one, NOT wanted to go to his dad&#39;s <br/>
house. he will ask me every day, many times a day, &quot;where am I going <br/>
today? where am I going tomorrow? Can I stay here forever?&quot; From the <br/>
beginning I have talked with him about it, listened to his feelings, <br/>
and been honest with him. I ask him why he doesn&#39;t want to go, and <br/>
he tells me that his dad is mean to him. His dad is a very <br/>
emotionally reserved guy; he is really a loner, and has little <br/>
understanding of the connective needs of the people who love him. He <br/>
is remarried, and has a stepson, 9, a daughter he has partial <br/>
custody of,9 and a 1 year old baby; they are expecting again in the <br/>
fall. <br/>
I explain to Ryan that his daddy loves him; sometimes he is grumpy <br/>
or upset, and he has trouble knowing what Ryan needs from him. I try <br/>
to help Ryan to express what he needs, like &quot;dad, I just need a hug&quot; <br/>
or &quot;I&#39;m hungry, tired, sad, etc.&quot; <br/>
(which makes me sad; that he has to be SO aware of his own needs, <br/>
that he cannot depend on them to meet these needs) There is very <br/>
little I can do on the dad front. His view is that Ryan should not <br/>
be allowed to &quot;run the show&quot; <br/>
Any unschooling literature I give him goes unread, and he <br/>
becomes beligerent if I try to &quot;tell him how to parent his son&quot; <br/>
His wife and I do communicate, we discuss the issues between Ryan <br/>
and his dad and she is open to the gentle and attachment parenting <br/>
styles, but her way, although loving, is jokey, a bit sarcastic, and <br/>
really just trying to cope with it all. Not very proactive. <br/>
I can&#39;t change them, I try to give as much feedback and influence as <br/>
they are receptive to- try not to make them feel as though I am <br/>
instructing them, but they just are not as emotionally connected to <br/>
their kids. <br/>
What I really want is for Ryan to get his needs met, and at this <br/>
point, I really need some good communication methods and coping <br/>
skills to bestow upon him, he needs me, and is asking me, for ways <br/>
to deal with the very different and kindof lonely life he has there. <br/>
I do not want a custody war, I think that would be far more <br/>
damaging, and I don&#39;t think it is conducive to the peace I am <br/>
striving to create and promote in the lives of our triad.<br/>
His new expression of the frustration he feels has been &quot;mom, it&#39;s <br/>
not good for me to go back and forth between two houses&quot; which I <br/>
think is very emotionally articulate for a 4 year old, but I can&#39;t <br/>
seem to give him any words of comfort, he just keeps saying it over <br/>
and over again. I mean, like, 10-15 times daily for at least two <br/>
weeks now. We talk about it, I tell him how I feel, how his dad <br/>
feels, ask him questions, and I am honest, I let him know that it <br/>
isn&#39;t my choice, which I don&#39;t think is helping, but I don&#39;t know <br/>
what else to say. (I really don&#39;t want to say, &#39;you cant always get <br/>
whatcha want!!&#39;  :)<br/>
Also, does anyone know how I can get maybe court ordered counseling <br/>
for the three, or more, of us? I just don&#39;t know how to reach this <br/>
man, that he is losing his son, without railroading him into <br/>
counseling, (he would absolutely not go on his own) I am just so sad <br/>
for my little guy, that he has to feel this way about his dad, that <br/>
I can&#39;t find the words, or actions, to help him. I mean, how can we <br/>
affect unwilling others&#39; attitudes towards our children? Thanks.</div>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and over again.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Is his dad willing to switch to every other weekend? Or just one day <br/>
each weekend? Its worth asking. It *is* stressful to switch back and <br/>
forth between families. That was how we ended up on an ever-other-<br/>
weekend plan with Rayan, transitioning bewteen two vastly different <br/>
sets of expectations was excruciating for him. Kids do need a <br/>
certain amount of consistency in their environment - that may be a <br/>
point worth mentioning.<br/>
<br/>
Wrt your ds - I wouldn&#39;t try to comfort him so much as to <br/>
acknowledge his unhappiness and support him in it: &quot;I think you&#39;re <br/>
right. It *isn&#39;t* good to go back and forth. It makes you <br/>
feel...sad, frustrated, unheard,&quot; whatever you are understanding <br/>
from him. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. It make me feel that way too.&quot; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d look into the availability of a counsellor who is supportive of <br/>
unschooling and/or non-authoritarian parenting before even <br/>
considering that. It won&#39;t do any of you any good to have a <br/>
resistant Ex *and* a counsellor who is trying to convince you to use <br/>
time-outs and set more rules! <br/>
<br/>
If you do find a supportive counsellor, you might want to start with <br/>
just you and your son going for awhile.  The important thing is to <br/>
find a way to help your son deal with the difficult emotional issues <br/>
*he* is experiencing. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1259607671">I am also a single mom and I usually just lurk on this list.  I have <br/>
six kids (15, 14, 12, 9, 5, and almost 3.) When I divorced their <br/>
father 2 years ago I insisted that the divorce decree state that none <br/>
of the children would be required to visit their father if they <br/>
didn&#39;t want to go.  While my ex had a fit the judge said he did not <br/>
think that was unreasonable and put it in the order. : )<br/>
<br/>
I mostly included it because of issues between my oldest son (now 14) <br/>
and his father but didn&#39;t specify just him at the time.  All of the <br/>
kids have opted not to go at various times.  I never wanted to have <br/>
to force them to go (and wouldn&#39;t have) and wanted to make sure they <br/>
had as much control in that as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Whether this is an option possible for you (or whether you would want <br/>
it) I have no idea.<br/>
<br/>
Forced counselling is rarely effective, even IF you could get it <br/>
ordersed and IF you could find one supportive of unschooling, etc...<br/>
<br/>
I wish you the best of luck in resolving this situation.  <br/>
Marge<br/>
<br/>
Granted, my ex-husband has since been reduced to only supervised <br/>
visits  because of his behavior/mouth (He is NPD--narcisistic <br/>
personality disorder.)  The kids very much get to decide the level of <br/>
involvement they have with him.<br/>
<br/>
I used to be more invested in making the relationship between the <br/>
kids and their father work.  In retospect, more so than he was.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-603985757">Hi Natalie,<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry that I do not have any words of wisdom for you, but I do <br/>
have empathy. <br/>
I too am a single mom to a ds (4). I left my abusive husband in 2004. <br/>
He has bounced in and out of ds life. I tried everything I could to <br/>
get him to connect or care about his children (he has a son (11) by a <br/>
previous marriage) when we were together. DS has never wanted to have <br/>
visitation either. He says that his daddy is mean and that he is <br/>
afraid. I am in the middle of my third custody battle in less then <br/>
three years, and despite my husband beating our child during his <br/>
first unsupervised visit, he still has visitation. <br/>
<br/>
The court, nor the guardian ad litem (attorney appointed to represent <br/>
ds&#39;s best interests) have been interested in what ds feels, or <br/>
frankly, needs. <br/>
<br/>
Last year I was having to drag my child out from underneath the bed <br/>
and forcing him to visit his dad - at a great cost to our <br/>
relationship (not to mention his development). When ds came home with <br/>
bruises, I could no longer force him to go. I now have a 90 day <br/>
suspending jail sentence  - suspended as long as I force ds to go to <br/>
visitation. <br/>
<br/>
Atleast now ds is better able to articulate and understand things, <br/>
but it breaks my heart when he cries and begs me to please not send <br/>
him to daddy. It takes everything I have to keep it together as I <br/>
watch ds scream, kick, and cry in anger and pain over his situation. <br/>
I will spare you the horrors of recent visitation, but I will say <br/>
that I am so outraged at how the legal system is failing our children.<br/>
<br/>
If I thought my husband had  even the slighest desire to know his <br/>
son, I would bend over backwards to help. <br/>
<br/>
For now, all it seems that I can do is to love ds, listen to him, and <br/>
be there for him.<br/>
<br/>
I will say that it has helped me to have a counselor and small <br/>
network of folks who care about me. Reading here and at always <br/>
unschooling really helps too. Ds has a counselor and I think she is <br/>
really helpful for him and me.<br/>
<br/>
I wish there was some way to get the other parent in these cases to <br/>
see what they are missing and all the damage they are doing. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-102973427">It is really nice to hear from other single moms, just too bad to <br/>
hear about the unfortunate circumsances.<br/>
<br/>
What state are you in that the judge would agree to let the children <br/>
have a say?<br/>
<br/>
When my stepson was refusing to go see his mom, the judge chastised <br/>
us for letting an 8 year old make that kind of decision- we needed to <br/>
step up and show him who the parents where, you know?<br/>
<br/>
Now that my ds is struggling so, the judge seemed obvious to his <br/>
suffering and even disregarded the letters from his counselors, <br/>
therapists, and physicians quantifying the damage (not to mention he <br/>
would not even allow their testimony)...<br/>
<br/>
My soon to be ex husband was labeled as most likely  manic <br/>

          It is really nice to hear from other single moms, just too bad to <br/>
hear about the unfortunate circumsances.<br/>
<br/>
What state are you in that the judge would agree to let the children <br/>
have a say?<br/>
<br/>
When my stepson was refusing to go see his mom, the judge chastised <br/>
us for letting an 8 year old make that kind of decision- we needed to <br/>
step up and show him who the parents where, you know?<br/>
<br/>
Now that my ds is struggling so, the judge seemed obvious to his <br/>
suffering and even disregarded the letters from his counselors, <br/>
therapists, and physicians quantifying the damage (not to mention he <br/>
would not even allow their testimony)...<br/>
<br/>
My soon to be ex husband was labeled as most likely manic <br/>
depressive, with antisocial personality disorder. The court appointed <br/>
psycholigical evaluater said he was most likely untreatable and posed <br/>
a serious threat to mother and children. He actually acted out for <br/>
the court how he planned to kill us, after beating me unconsious and <br/>
punting me around the yard with our 22 month old child in my arms. No <br/>
consequences.<br/>
<br/>
This summer, he beat our child. No consequences. <br/>
