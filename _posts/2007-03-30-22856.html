<div id="ygrps-yiv-1299721634">My children deal with this public/social anxiety too.  They each have  <br/>
their own set of fears, but both sets often prevent us from going  <br/>
out, or staying at a place where we already are.<br/>
<br/>
For Tess (7 years old), it&#39;s usually about bees, but it can be other  <br/>
things that she doesn&#39;t name (a &quot;funny feeling&quot;) she calls it.  For  <br/>
Paige (4 years old), it&#39;s anything closing (and this can be anything  <br/>
even remotely related to closing -  the library announcing that they  <br/>
will close in 30 minutes, a cashier closing her aisle, a librarian  <br/>
shutting down her computer, the end of a temple service or a musical  <br/>
performance, etc).  For both of them, and especially  for Paige, it&#39;s  <br/>
pandemonium once they decide it&#39;s time to leave.<br/>
<br/>
My main problem with this is not meeting the need of each child.  I  <br/>
want to hug them and let them know it&#39;s okay to be scared.  It&#39;s that  <br/>
each one&#39;s fear changes what the other is doing, or what the whole  <br/>
family is doing.  Then, someone winds up feeling resentful.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a small example.  We decide we are going to the library.  Tess  <br/>
and Paige are both happy and we go.  As we pull up to the parking  <br/>
spot, Paige asks if it&#39;s almost dinner time.  I say that we have  <br/>
about a hour before Daddy gets home and then we&#39;ll head home for  <br/>
dinner (I try to be careful not to mention anything closing!).   <br/>
Paige&#39;s brain starts thinking that dinner time is close to night- <br/>
time, which means that the library might close sometime soon.  Since  <br/>
she&#39;s 4, she can&#39;t understand that the library closing in an hour (or  <br/>
2 hours) is a pretty long time, so she starts to freak out and now  <br/>
she doesn&#39;t want to go.  Now Tess is upset because she still wants to  <br/>
go.  I have no way of helping both children at that moment in time  <br/>
and it feels so hard for me to handle (which means all 3 of us are  <br/>
upset!).<br/>
<br/>
I have started to make contingency plans, knowing that these things  <br/>
can happen (bringing 2 cars to temple, or a show for example, so that  <br/>
one of us can take Paige home if we need to).  I&#39;ve also started to  <br/>
(with the help of this list, and various books) use calm moments to  <br/>
talk about how we can help each other out, and meet each other&#39;s  <br/>
needs.  Both of these things are helping, but there are still  <br/>
countless moments a day where both children need/want exactly the  <br/>
opposite thing, and I can&#39;t choose.<br/>

This is hard for me, too, and I add a 3rd child!  That was one of my frustrations with The Unprocessed Child, she only had one child.  And when you must choose the kids try to keep score and all of them think that I always favor someone else!   The debates and wailing and hurt feelings can be exhausting.  I guess that as they have gotten older and lost some of these fears and learned to govern their emotions it&#39;s a little easier but never easy.  Sorry I had no answers just commiseration!

<br/>
I have 4 and 5 year old boys and my 5 year old especially shows some <br/>
anxiety like that.  For example if we are going someplace he really <br/>
wants to go and it starts at 3 (noone will be there till 3) but we <br/>
leave at 2 to run an errand on the way.  He will be very anxious and <br/>
upset the whole time cause he thinks we will be late.  He has little <br/>
concept of time being 5 and I reassure him and he is getting better <br/>
about it and sometimes we avoid running errands on the way but <br/>
sometimes it in unavoidable.  I think in the situation you described <br/>
above being that 4 year olds have very little concept of time you <br/>
might not go into detail but say, &quot;why do you ask are you hungry&quot; and <br/>
give her a snack before going in and if she says no she is just <br/>
curious just say oh we have plenty of time and go in the library <br/>
without going into detail of how long and what your doing next ect.  <br/>
cause that just pushes her mind forward onto the next thing instead <br/>
of  the thing you are doing right now.<br/>
<br/>
We spend alot of time negociating between two wills and interests too.</div>

 </span></blockquote>On the Consensual Living list we discuss exactly this issue where<br/>
seemingly opposing wants, appear to be either/or. We seek to identify<br/>
the underlying needs, rather than focusing on the strategies to meet<br/>
those needs. We don&#39;t *choose* between our children&#39;s wants; together<br/>
we create solutions which are preferable to all involved. You all are<br/>
welcome to join the list for developing &#39;out of the box&#39; solutions for<br/>
specific situations which have a pattern of frustration for your<br/>
families. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Consensual-living/?yguid=287472904">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Consensual-living/?yguid=287472904</a><br/>

<br/>
(from the home page): Consensual living is a process, a philosophy, a<br/>
mindset by which we seek to live in harmony with our families and<br/>
community. It involves finding mutually agreed upon solutions, where<br/>
the needs of both parties are not only considered but addressed.<br/>
Everyone&#39;s wants and needs are equally valid, regardless of age.<br/>
Conflicting wants or needs are discussed and mutually agreeable<br/>
solutions are created or negotiated which meet the underlying needs of<br/>
all parties. <br/>
<br/>
Beginners to this concept are welcome to join this list, living<br/>
consensually is an ongoing process of discovery. We ask that you be<br/>
open to or on the path toward living consensually. We hope to explore<br/>
the issues by asking questions, and sharing our experiences. Parenting<br/>
is a sensitive issue for many people but we are all here to practice<br/>
this process, and can do so if the environment remains one of respect,<br/>
compassion, exploration and understanding. If you would like more<br/>

Many of the 500+ families on the Consensual Living list have multiple<br/>
children. By creating solutions which address the *underlying needs*<br/>
of all members, everyone feels heard and working *together*, rather<br/>
than against one another to have their solution &quot;win&quot;. You are welcome<br/>
to bring challenging situations to the group for discussion and ideas.<br/>
It is a completely different atmosphere, when you trust that there ARE<br/>
solutions which everyone prefers, rather than settling on compromises<br/>
where someone gives in. <br/>

On a practical note, have you tried giving her a<br/>
watch, a stopwatch, or a timer so she can keep track<br/>
of how long it will be before something closes? Then,<br/>
be sure you get there way ahead of closing you you are<br/>
always long gone before time runs out. <br/>

translate it into TV shows. Like if she asked how long until Daddy  <br/>
gets home I&#39;d say, It&#39;s almost 2 now and he gets home at 6 [counting  <br/>
