<div id="ygrps-yiv-132807837">I&#39;ve been thinking about a recent comment and this thread.<br/>
Unschoolers may not tend to &quot;ignore&quot; their children&#39;s behavior at the park <br/>
more than other hsers- but maybe they have come to unschooling because their <br/>
children are very active, spirited, whatever you want to call it, so unschooling <br/>
is what works best with their children and their learning styles.  (kind of <br/>
like what came first the chicken or the egg?)<br/>
<br/>
My son (age 4) is very &quot;spirited&quot; I&#39;d call him, and did not play well with <br/>
many of the other kids we used to play with.  When he was about 2 1/2 we stopped <br/>
going to planned activities and play groups and tried just playing at home, <br/>
and interacting with other children in limited setting like playgrounds and the <br/>
library.  As he&#39;s gotten older, we&#39;ve been able to attend more playgroup type <br/>
activities and playground days.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s still very active and loud, sometimes other children are put off by his <br/>
behavior (growling and roaring at them in play).  Some days we have to leave, <br/>
not very often anymore.   But I give him a wide latitude about what behaviors <br/>
are ok, and which I need to stop immediately.  Many other parents would not <br/>
let their kids do some of the things he does at the park (for example- roar and <br/>
play dinosaur while playing chase, other kids don&#39;t always like it), but if we <br/>
left everytime he did that, he would never get out of the house.  <br/>
<br/>
If no one is getting hurt or in danger, I try to let him go.  I think all <br/>
kids need to learn to play without their parent&#39;s hovering over them.  When he <br/>
was 2 (he&#39;s very big for his age) and would push kids down or run into them, I <br/>
did have to stand right over him when he was near other kids (so much for <br/>
parent&#39;s getting to interact with adults, huh?).  But now he doesn&#39;t need that so I <br/>
can step back a bit.  Obviously if things start to get too rough, I do <br/>
intervene.<br/>
<br/>
Also, he&#39;s getting much better and needs the practice of interactions.  He&#39;s <br/>
started to talk to other kids alot more during play, and realize when people <br/>
don&#39;t want to play with him because of how he&#39;s acted.  It&#39;s nice to see him <br/>
begin to make friends and be able to go to a playground and play nicely with <br/>
kids he&#39;s just met.<br/>
<br/>
I also have a daughter age 1 who he plays with very well.  We may or may not <br/>
have any more children.  It depends on how things go in the next year or so.  <br/>
Right now my hands are full with these 2.  But I can&#39;t imagine trying to <br/>
&quot;teach&quot; my children like school at home.  I used to be a special ed teacher.  <br/>
Unschooling sounds the way to go!<br/>
Just my (well more than) 2 cents.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1580032334">If other kids &quot;don&#39;t like it&quot; I try to stop my son with this <br/>
information. I don&#39;t want him to do things to other people that they <br/>
do not want done to them. I explain that the other person is <br/>
intimidated and feels threatened (assuming the child has conveyed a <br/>
desire for the behavior to stop). I give my son the cues to look for  <br/>
such as the child is running away and screaming stop, or crying, etc. <br/>
I do not hover, nor do I &quot;let him go&quot; without information any more <br/>
than I would if we were in a place where physical things could be <br/>
damaged. I think that it is damaging to a child to have no one <br/>
advocate for them when they clearly are wanting something to stop. I <br/>
believe that I am complicit in the damage if I do not dissent. Just <br/>
as when a child is crying for a parent to stop doing something to <br/>
them, I try to empathize with the child. <br/>
<br/>
This is one of my hot buttons, because I WAS the child, and I had no <br/>
advocate. I do speak up for the child to be heard. I don&#39;t believe <br/>
that anyone has a right to do anything to anyone that they don&#39;t want <br/>
done to them. My son knows I feel this way, sometimes he does <br/>
continue. So, I try to empower the other child to see that they can <br/>
choose to use their words to tell my son to stop, they can leave, <br/>
they can ask their parent or other adult for help. <br/>
<br/>
Similarly, I empower my son to use his words to ask someone to stop <br/>
doing something to him that he doesn&#39;t want done. He knows he can <br/>
tell me to stop. I do. His body is his to control. But I do give him <br/>
my opinion, and strongly when he is doing something to someone <br/>
against their will. If it is physically hurtful, I remove him. I can <br/>
not remember when this may have happened last, before he understood <br/>
that some of his behavior could inflict pain probably. I don&#39;t know <br/>
that there is any benefit to giving my opinion strongly, perhaps even <br/>
a disadvantage, but I am emphatic about people&#39;s rights to their body.<br/>
Giving him information is the key. He can&#39;t read minds and we are all <br/>
slower at picking up social cues when we are busy, hungary or tired.<br/>
<br/>
We do discuss taking turns and sharing before going to places that <br/>
this is likely to be an issue. We discuss that it is hard to take <br/>
turns and find fun things to do when we are tired or hungary. We have <br/>
discussed this phenomena so many times that now when he has a hard <br/>
time taking a turn or waiting for a turn and I mention that I see <br/>
that it is hard to take turns, he says &quot;I&#39;m hungary&quot; and he dis-<br/>
engages and comes for something to eat. Then he is more patient, just <br/>
as I am when I am not tired or hungary myself. We never use any type <br/>
of punishment. I do explain though that people do not want to play if <br/>
they can&#39;t have a turn. We wants to play. He is learning to enjoy <br/>
watching someone else take a turn. It is a progression I want to <br/>
facilitate and not let him flounder alone.<br/>

 <br/>
This is one of the few principles we use that readily boils down to a  rule.  <br/>
I rarely have to enforce it with my own children, but when there are  lots of <br/>
kids here I usually have to reiterate.  We usually say something  like, &quot;No <br/>
means no.  If someone wants you to stop doing something to them,  you stop.  <br/>
Anyone has the right to say &quot;no&quot; about their body.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
There are so many implications and applications to this principle.   From an <br/>
unwanted kiss on the cheek (all of my son have been known to want to  plant <br/>
kisses on their friends without consent) to molestation to outright  bullying.  <br/>
Learning to follow the principle, and applying it  to your own body, can put a <br/>
stop to all of them.  I think it&#39;s my  responsibility for my sons to learn <br/>
that &#39;no means no&#39;.  <br/>
 <br/>
For some reason it is a really hard idea to grasp for the kids I know (not  <br/>
my kids).  I guess mostly because they&#39;re not raised to have respect for  their <br/>
bodies.  I have seen the idea light up in some kids when they realize  they <br/>
can stop people from touching *them*, too, at least when they&#39;re at our  house. <br/>

<br/>
This was a big issue with a (former) neighbor, who&#39;s 9. He has very <br/>
controling parents and he assumed that he could do things to my kids. <br/>
Not mean things, but if I said it was time to go, he&#39;d try to carry <br/>
one of the kids to the door. Or strap Mikey in his car seat. But <br/>
Mikey is really sensitive to having people touch him sometimes. The <br/>
neighbor learned to ask &quot;Can I strap you in now?&quot; etc. I mean, Mikey <br/>
was going to get strapped in, but it never occured to him that the <br/>
_way_ you did it could have such an effect on how happy or upset <br/>
Mikey was. And that it mattered!<br/>
<br/>
Then they moved. After only 2 weeks away, he came by and drove both <br/>
kids nuts trying to control them. <br/>
<br/>
Other kids like to pick Caroline up and put her in the wagon or <br/>
something and look at me when she fusses. &quot;Well, if she says no, put <br/>
her down.&quot; Confusion, but then, yeh, the light comes on. <br/>

My kids are the same way.  :)  <br/>
The *way* something is done or handled can make all the difference in <br/>
the world.  It can create a good outcome or a bad one.  So our <br/>
families had a crash course in how to do things in a way that didn&#39;t <br/>
cause an &quot;explosive/uncooperative&quot; reaction in the kids.  <br/>
