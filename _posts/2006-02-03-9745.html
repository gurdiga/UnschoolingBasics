  Basically, your son is enjoying some blocks and some music.  I don&#39;t see any harm in that. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1485734104">How do you use them in your home? Do you buy the curriculum that goes to it?<br/>
I thought about pick up the curriculum - more for myself then my son -<br/>
because he is very mathematically inclined and I am not very good at math. I<br/>
can barely add without counting on my fingers. I got descent grades in PS in<br/>
Algebra and such but that was eons ago.<br/>
