<div id="ygrps-yiv-51652072">~We do everything together as a group- I don&#39;t take one child at a<br/>
time for a &quot;special outing&quot; or for &quot;boy&#39;s day out&quot; or &quot;girl&#39;s day <br/>
out&quot;.~<br/>
<br/>
We just started making more time to do one on one things with each of <br/>
our kids and it&#39;s great.  When my 3 kids are all together they <br/>
sometimes overshadow each other, by talking for the other one, <br/>
interrupting or demanding what they want more over a sibling.  My <br/>
middle child is easy going and will just go with the flow even if he&#39;d <br/>
prefer to do something differently.  That is exactly why it is so <br/>
very, very important to let him have his time where he can do what he <br/>
really wants to do.  Also having one on one time with each of my kids <br/>
is WAY cool, we get to have amazing conversations and have special <br/>
time together.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1646890941">I agree completely. We&#39;ve always made it important to have special  <br/>
time with each one...I usually take a kid out twice a week, even if  <br/>
it&#39;s just to get groceries we&#39;ll buy a soda from the machine and sit  <br/>
on the bumper sharing. Dh takes one out to lunch each month, they get  <br/>
dropped off at his office and they eat at campus corner and walk home  <br/>
with him.<br/>
It used to be that dh and I wanted us all to do everything together,  <br/>
but it wasn&#39;t fair. Primarily because we have special needs going on,  <br/>
but also because with seven kids, it was too overwhelming to go  <br/>
somewhere. We do most things together, but some things are better alone.<br/>

YES!!<br/>
My dh and I always comment on how different they are when we&#39;re alone<br/>
with them. Different dynamics, everytime a different group of humans<br/>
is together. One on one allows my kids to shine in their own way,<br/>
without having to share my attention. It&#39;s cool to hear them tell me<br/>
things they might not in a group situation.<br/>
