<div id="ygrps-yiv-518383931">I think I&#39;ve always been an unschooler. My valiant attempts at <br/>
teaching my two children packaged curriculum, or the hodge podge <br/>
known as &quot;The Classical Method&quot; always left me giving up halfway <br/>
through and just letting the kids be kids. I have a natually curious <br/>
daughter who was constantly checking books out from the library <br/>
about what she wanted to learn anyway (now that my son is older he <br/>
does the same). But I didn&#39;t officially start unscooling until this <br/>
year. Not because of the great books I read (there were many, John <br/>
Holt & David Albert among them ), not because of the wonderful <br/>
websites and testimonials (although they were informative and <br/>
inspiring). The low down dirty truth is that my mother died. A <br/>
horrible, unexpected death, and two years later I am still reeling <br/>
from it. Although I got into counseling right away, it wasn&#39;t until <br/>
this year that her death really hit home. I found that I needed to <br/>
stop the whirlwind of my life and just BE. So we stopped &quot;doing <br/>
school&quot;. We started just living. I started sleeping in and letting <br/>
the kids get up and do whatever they wanted. Sometimes that was <br/>
playing a video game, sometimes it meant they made cookies for <br/>
breakfast (with me on call to take the cookie sheet out of the <br/>
oven), or played mancala or played zoo with all their stuffed <br/>
animals. We played cards together, took walks, watched movies, had <br/>
tea. I asked for time alone when I needed it. At first I felt <br/>
guilty, was I being neglectful? We weren&#39;t doing our Saxon math! Was <br/>
it ok to have them downstairs making toast (at ages 11 & 6 ) while I <br/>
slept til 7:30 or 8? I was so used to being &quot;super mom&quot;, the <br/>
attached parent. Now my daughter is getting nervous about this new <br/>
unschooling thing. &quot;Will I learn what I need to know?&quot; she&#39;ll <br/>
ask. &quot;Honey you can learn whatever you want, and that will be what <br/>
you need to know&quot; is what I&#39;ve been replying. So we go to the <br/>
library, we go to the park, we watch Bill Nye the Science guy. On my <br/>
down days I hope it will be enough. It is enough for me that I have <br/>
happy, healthy children. And truth be told, I need this unschooling <br/>
as much as they do. And so I ramble here on this post. For <br/>
reassurance, for support, for companionship; and just to say hello.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening,<br/>
<br/>
Sara :-)</div>

<br/>
I am sorry to hear about your motherï¿½s untimely death.  :-(  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I am happy for you and your children however, that it brought you to<br/>
unschooling.  Your days sound wonderful and as long as you are available to<br/>
your children to help them follow their dreams and interests, they will be<br/>
fine.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Keep your chin up.  :-)<br/>
