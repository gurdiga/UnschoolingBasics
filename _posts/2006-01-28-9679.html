<div id="ygrps-yiv-131215422">The CNN episode on unschooling is scheduled for this coming Monday, Jan 30 at 10 pm Eastern time.  I think the confusion about air date was because the show is named CNN TONIGHT, which was mistaken by some of us as tonight, meaning this past Friday.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1932170158">It look like this thing was already aired on CNN.  I got this today from another list.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/01/27/gutierrez.unschooing/index.html1">http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/01/27/gutierrez.unschooing/index.html1</a><br/>
I loved the last 2 lines although I know that they were probably included in there to try and make unschooling sound like a negative thing.  Not really was I expected, or maybe it was.......sigh.<br/>

I agree with you Maggie, I liked it for the most part until the last comment<br/>
the 10 year old made...nice of them to cut it off like that huh?  I think<br/>
though that more people will be educating themselves on what unschooling<br/>
really is though and who knows...maybe Oprah will do a segment on it...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1314420217">I agree with both of you also, I liked it for the most part too, but then <br/>
when I read the last comments and I thought, DA, if the kid has to take their <br/>
&quot;required testing&quot; then she MUST be learning something or you can bet they would <br/>
have dwelled on that for sure! AND the school district would be &quot;squawking&quot; <br/>
loud at the parents and CNN both! They never even mentioned what her test scores <br/>
are! (must be pretty decent then, eh?&lt;G&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
This part cracks me up......<br/>

<br/>
......Ahhh, yes, there is nothing like a &quot;school setting&quot; Mr. Tokofsky, being <br/>
bullied by kids AND teachers, being belittled by kids AND teachers, being <br/>
involved in pier pressure so you can just &quot;learn to say no&quot; somehow, being graded <br/>
for everything you do, (not just academics) including your ideas, thoughts, <br/>
hopes and dreams, ... all of this constantly, on a daily basis! Oh and having <br/>
to kiss the teachers butt just so you can get a drink of water when you&#39;re <br/>
thirsty or use the bathroom when needed because other kids before you may have <br/>
abused the &quot;privilege&quot; of doing so freely, oh and not to mention the torment that <br/>
can happen on a bus ride home! Yea, that&#39;s the sort of &quot;texture&quot; I want for <br/>
my kids.<br/>
