<div id="ygrps-yiv-1102721611"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;She just won&#39;t do things WITH others--Um, yes, she IS <br/>
&gt;autistic...not an excuse, but you must understand many (not ALL) <br/>
&gt;children with autism do NOT have the social skills or desires!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, this sort of thing is one of the biggest hassles I&#39;ve seen in <br/>
the persistant use of lables - they don&#39;t give enough of the right kind <br/>
of information. <br/>
<br/>
Are you saying she feels disconnected from other people? Uncomfortable <br/>
around other people? In what ways? Verbally? Visually? Kinetically? <br/>
Energetically? That&#39;s IMPORTANT - more important than whether she falls <br/>
into category x or y or xy. Its something *you* need to consider pretty <br/>
consistently in your relationship. I&#39;m sure you already know that! but <br/>
its worth considering specifically wrt your concern that some of her <br/>
meltdowns seem to &quot;come out of the blue&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
It may be useful to think about how much human contact, and what kinds <br/>
(verbal, visual, touch, proximity), your dd has over a period of time - <br/>
a day, five days, two weeks - and see if there is a relationship <br/>
between how much &quot;irritating contact&quot; she gets (for want of a better <br/>
expression) and how likely she is to melt down &quot;out of the blue&quot;. This <br/>
is the sort of thing that&#39;s going to vary a whole bunch from person to <br/>
person. Some people build up stress in this way over a loooong period <br/>
of time if they don&#39;t have a way to discharge it. It makes looking for <br/>
triggers confusing bc you only *notice* the last straw, and that keeps <br/>
changing - sound familiar?<br/>
<br/>
If this does seem to be an issue, you can start looking for ways to <br/>
help your dd have more control over the kinds of contact she <br/>
experiences. Probably pulling her out of school in and of itself has <br/>
helped her have a whole lot more control in this regard - which could <br/>
explain why she&#39;s not nearly as likely to melt down or as severely now <br/>
that she&#39;s home. <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t stress enough the importance of looking at different *kinds* of <br/>
contact/stimulation. It may be that there are ways to be present with <br/>
her *and* give her the space/control she needs. <br/>
<br/>
One of the theories that applies to *some* people with autism is that <br/>
they seem to process information via one method at a time - whereas <br/>
most other people process via multiple methods simultaneosly. That may <br/>
be old news to you, I don&#39;t know - but that&#39;s also a good place to look <br/>
for possible &quot;triggers&quot;, especially in light of what I said about build-<br/>
up over time. If she&#39;s being asked (by circumstances) to process <br/>
information via multiple means too many times in a day (or week, or <br/>
fortnight!) that could well trigger a meltdown. Too many notes. <br/>
