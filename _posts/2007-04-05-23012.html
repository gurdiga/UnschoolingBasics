<div id="ygrps-yiv-71770843">Hello! I am sure you all have been asked this question before, but I<br/>
am sure you need practice refining your answers.<br/>
<br/>
I have been homeschooling my daughter for a little over 3 years. We<br/>
made a miserable attempt at unschooling when we started.<br/>
Unfortunately, we were socializing with homeschoolers that were very<br/>
school-at-home and I gave in. For the next couple of years we used an<br/>
eclectic approach with mixed results. This last year, we purchased a<br/>
curriculum. We have been muddling through it, but both my daughter and<br/>
I want something more. <br/>
<br/>
Anybody have suggestions? I know she could go so far, if she would<br/>
just go! How do I get her started learning on her own? I have borrowed<br/>
The Teenage Liberation Handbook from the library and I have just<br/>
started reading it. I would like her to read it as well, but I am not<br/>
sure how to approach it. If she feels it is forced, she will<br/>
half-heartedly read it.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you everyone in advance!<br/>
<br/>
Kristi N.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-606832276">Why don&#39;t you just tell her she&#39;s finished everything for the year and <br/>
it&#39;s time for summer vacation and just never come off of vacation.  You <br/>
don&#39;t have to be sneaky about it.<br/>

Is your goal to be sneaky? Is that the way you&#39;d like her to treat you?<br/>
<br/>
Can you think of a better way?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2064945030">i am also confused why you can&#39;t just discuss with her your feelings about<br/>
the &quot;education&quot; she is currently receiving openly and honestly.  you said<br/>
yourself that the more she does curriculum the less she wants to actually<br/>
learn.  why wait?  and why sneak it in when it can be a joint effort between<br/>
you?  as for the book, you could read her passages that you find<br/>
significant, just because you&#39;d like to share them with her, not to be<br/>
sneaky, and be straightforward with her that you think it would be a fun<br/>
thing for her to read, but let her take the lead on whether or not to read<br/>
it.  leave it laying around a lot.  (i do this with my husband, who loves to<br/>
read but rarely has the time to read everything i want him to...i just read<br/>
him passages or leave it open by the toilet to a page i want him to read.<br/>
seems like that&#39;s the only time he gets a chance, LOL!)<br/>

&quot;Years ago I recognized my kinship with all living things, and I made up my<br/>
mind that I was not one bit better than the meanest on the earth. I said<br/>
then and I say now, that while there is a lower class, I am in it; while<br/>
there is a criminal element, I am of it; while there is a soul in prison, I<br/>
am not free.&quot;<br/>

Anybody have suggestions? I know she could go so far, if she would<br/>
just go! How do I get her started learning on her own? I have borrowed<br/>
The Teenage Liberation Handbook from the library and I have just<br/>
started reading it. I would like her to read it as well, but I am not<br/>
sure how to approach it. If she feels it is forced, she will<br/>
half-heartedly read it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I HIGHLY recommend a conference. She would be on board almost <br/>
immediately.<br/>
<br/>
But she needs *healing* first! She needs to &quot;veg out&quot; for a few months. <br/>
To get her head together.<br/>
<br/>
Before she can rediscover learning, she&#39;ll have to do nothing for a <br/>
while. She won&#39;t actually *BE* doing nothing. It&#39;ll just look that way.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;ll be healing and finding out about what makes her tick. *YOU* just <br/>
have to be patient. Very, very patient. Trust that she&#39;s doing what&#39;s <br/>
needed. It will probably look like sleeping, talking on the phone, and <br/>
watching TV. But it will soon (and certainly NOT soon enough!) start <br/>
looking like something---like gardening or drawing or sewing or <br/>
skateboarding---or something interesting.<br/>
<br/>
You can read the book TO her. I read the TLH to Cameron when he was <br/>
deschooling. He really doesn&#39;t remember much---if anything. But he <br/>
remembers talking about it. And now he&#39;s been to Grace&#39;s camps, so he <br/>
knows her personally.<br/>
<br/>
This will be the most painful period for *you* because it is! Watching <br/>
your child do nothing. It sucks. But it&#39;s necessary for the healing to <br/>
take place. And the more patient you are, the quicker it&#39;ll happen!<br/>
<br/>
Patience. Patience. Patience!<br/>
<br/>
Oh---also go to or rent lots and lots of movies. Eat out at or fix <br/>
ethnic food. Do things considered &quot;vacation-y.&quot; PLAY!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
She&#39;s been learning on her own from the day she was born...not<br/>
entirely on her own of course. There have been people and experiences<br/>
and books and tv shows and all sorts of things that have assisted her<br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
Are you wanting her learning to look a certain way? It might never<br/>
look anything like school work. How &quot;far&quot; does she need to go? Maybe<br/>
she just wants to explore right in her own home for a while.<br/>
<br/>
Learning isn&#39;t about milestones, or &quot;going far&quot; or looking a certain<br/>
way. It&#39;s a journey. And it&#39;s best defined by living well.<br/>
