<div id="ygrps-yiv-1678320978">Upon reading some of the recent posts, I am realizing that I am very<br/>
guilty of micromanaging my 10 y/o DS. I often find myself telling him<br/>
to change his clothes into something more appropriate, eat something<br/>
healthier, do [whatever] at a different time, etc. I really don&#39;t want<br/>
to continue to do this. I guess the reason that I do is because I feel<br/>
like if I don&#39;t tell him to, he&#39;ll never do things in an appropriate<br/>
and timely fashion. Help me get over this! He&#39;s got to learn some<br/>
self-motivation and I don&#39;t think I&#39;m helping. <br/>

<br/>
What is appropriate and timely changes day to day, moment to moment. Realizing this is the first step I think. There&#39;s not only one right way to dress or act or participate in something. <br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s the worst that could happen if your kid wears something you don&#39;t think is appropriate? What&#39;s the worst that could happen if he&#39;s late doing something or arriving somewhere? Ask yourself these questions often. Sometimes it matters, most times it doesn&#39;t.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Self motivation for what? He won&#39;t be self motivated to do the things you want. His  motivation will be to do the things he thinks are important.  Many times those things will match your picture of how life should look. Sometimes it won&#39;t. But really, is wearing a pair of shorts in February or having messy hair all that bad? ;o)<br/>

guess I&#39;m just worried because his father has ZERO motivation to do<br/>
anything in life (unemployed, lives with parents, no car, no child<br/>
support, etc). I fear that he will become that way. However, I know my<br/>
approach has got to change. I am going to strive every day to catch<br/>
myself making decisions for him that he should be making every day and<br/>
hopefully as he grows and watches the rest of our family he will learn<br/>
to manage himelf.<br/>

We live in an extremely conservative area and my 12yo who hates to bathe, wash his hair or change clothes chooses to engage in group activities (like a shooting sports team through 4-H) where the group guidelines state that you should be dressed to represent your county.  We talk with Zach about that ahead of time.  In that situation, it is about respect.  If he really doesn&#39;t want to bathe or change clothes, he doesn&#39;t have to participate in the group.<br/>

Well, to me the crazy part is that he&#39;s still in school. ;o) <br/>
<br/>
But to answer your question I wouldn&#39;t worry about him wearing the same clothes for a few days. Kids do that. You could always wash them in the evenings so that they&#39;re at least clean and fresh each day. Try not to care what other people think so much. They may very well be judging you but so what? In your heart you know that you are moving towards wanting a different life for your son. Let this be your first little defiant step.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1733754967">Wow. In our public schools (when we were there, of course, up til  <br/>
last year) the teachers totally expected kids to wear what they  <br/>
wanted. They didn&#39;t judge families based on clothes choices or hair  <br/>
styles or whatever. Some kids would go in their pj&#39;s. Of course,  <br/>
dressed like that comes with consequences, like no recess if it&#39;s  <br/>
cold outside, but it certainly was not a big deal. Nor is it a big  <br/>
deal for us. If the kids *smell* or look grimy, I just point out that  <br/>
smelling like they do, it&#39;s unlikely people would want to be too  <br/>
close ;-) Sometimes they change, sometimes not. It&#39;s really not any  <br/>
body&#39;s business how my kids dress.<br/>

his black jeans. So I bought him 4 pairs of them.  His teacher questioned <br/>
why he was &quot;always wearing the same pants&quot;.  She asked if his social worker <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, you&#39;re right. Shoes are meant to be worn, but last time he got a<br/>
brand new pair (a birthday gift that cost $60!) he wore them out in<br/>
the mud the next day. I just thought it would have been nice to keep<br/>
them decent looking for at least a few weeks. I mean, he had several<br/>
other pairs he could have worn for muddy play. I guess that&#39;s just me<br/>
being anal. I&#39;m getting great feedback here!<br/>

&gt; &quot;My kids often stay in the same clothes for a couple days at a time<br/>
&gt; but it isn&#39;t because they like the clothes so much but because<br/>
&gt; changing clothes seems like too much of an effort to bother with. <br/>
&gt; (they often sleep in the same clothes too.)&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yeah, mine too.  Personally, I wouldn&#39;t be afraid of a visit from CPS<br/>
&gt; over clothes!! To heck with what anyone thinks. If wearing the same<br/>
&gt; clothes for three days causes a visit, bring it on. Cripes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1857739099">I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s been said yet but....<br/>
Children who are respected and loved IMO don&#39;t act out or make choices that  <br/>
are risky to their health or others. <br/>
 <br/>
I know many moms who&#39;s children (sons) liked a certain shirt or pants. They  <br/>
washed them at night and one sent a lil note to the teacher.  I don&#39;t  think <br/>
its rare at all..<br/>
 <br/>
The shoe situation was one I cringed about last week. I bought one of my  <br/>
little guys a pair of sneaks I have been looking at and got a great deal on  <br/>
them. Our yard is mud pit. I hoped he wouldn&#39;t put them on to go out and play  <br/>
because of the mud but also because it is so muddy he would be in deeper than  <br/>
the shoe. He did after a day or so decide to wear them and they did get covered  <br/>
but look just as new after a wash. No harm done.. Glad I didn&#39;t say  <br/>
anything... a few years ago I may have.. <br/>
With four I buy backups. Not 60.00 but I buy right. <br/>
Yesterday I walked into Gap and found sneaker/shoes (quicklace) for  $2.97. <br/>
Could have purchased 3 pair to replace the Vans I bought also on  clearance. <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;d say with love and support 10 out of 10 will result in no harm. It&#39;s ok  <br/>
to help them. Saying no due to what if&#39;s is harder than saying yes..standing by <br/>
 them as support and being there with the hug or high five is way more fun. <br/>
 <br/>
Laura<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;You know, I know that 9 times out of 10 letting him make his  own<br/>
choice will not result in any harm done. So, how do you draw the  line?<br/>
Just on safety issues? For example, sometimes he wants to wear  the<br/>
same clothes 3 days out of a week to school (yes, he is in PS  right<br/>
now, we are moving to HS very soon). I&#39;m afraid people think  I&#39;m<br/>
neglectful and don&#39;t buy him enough clothes! Is that crazy of me?  Or<br/>
he&#39;ll want to wear his brand new shoes outside to play. Should I  just<br/>
let him and explain that if they&#39;re ruined, that&#39;s fine, but no  more<br/>
new ones for X amount of time? I appreciate any  thoughts.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1193672663">My kids ARE home but the original posters&#39; weren&#39;t yet.  I don&#39;t know why.  But it doesn&#39;t have to be the school, it could be the doctor, a neighbor, a sil.  Child Protective Services can take your children for 24 hours with very little provocation and I have yet to meet a judge that will return the kids at the &quot;show-cause&quot; hearing.  They will make the kids wait 3 months to go home, just to CYA.  <br/>
<br/>
Because of that, I think it is really important to CONSIDER the norms of your community when talking with your kids.  In our community, it is the norm for boys to have short haircuts, be quite clean, wear a belt, etc..  Girls have their hair combed, wear shoes all the time, etc..  When my youngest who has very curly, wild hair wanted to try kindergarten last year, we got notes sent home because the teacher thought she wasn&#39;t being cared for due to us not washing and combing her hair daily.<br/>
<br/>
Do I sit and freak out over it?  No.  Do I take things into consideration?  Yes.  And I talk with my kids about it.  <br/>

Kathryn&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
LOL! <br/>
<br/>
There are many days in the winter that they do not ride and only go to the<br/>
barn to feed and shovel stalls, but then again, they do wear breeches when<br/>
they ride and their shirts stay under their coats.  :)<br/>
<br/>
If their clothes are noticeably dirty I ask them to change and they do or I<br/>
bring them a change of clothes and help them change.  I wouldn&#39;t want them<br/>
to climb into bed with fur and dirt all over them.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just there is no rule that you have to change your clothes every day.<br/>
If they are dirty, they change, sometimes with my help and sometimes not.<br/>
Just because they can do it themselves doesn&#39;t mean that they don&#39;t enjoy<br/>
help.  <br/>
<br/>
I have no worries that they need to change because someone might report us<br/>
to the authorities or because most people change every day.  It hasn&#39;t<br/>
killed them yet and they appear to be clean though they only bathe about<br/>
once a week.  <br/>

Now that I think about it though, I am a lot more relaxed about horse or<br/>

much because my main foucs is what will make them sick and that is usually a<br/>

there seemed to be coughing, I&#39;d definitely encourage them to wash before<br/>

<br/>
Absolutely.  Just because something is legal doesn&#39;t mean that it will be approved for an adopting family.  We are an anglo couple and now youngest of five is biracial.  The worker had an issue with mixed race families and drug her heels on the entire process.  I ended up having to call the head guy of CPS in Texas and threatening legal action to get it pushed through.  If there had been question of the kids not bathing or wearing clothes for several days to school, we would have been sunk even though no one was being neglected.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2039601429">&quot;I just thought it would have been nice to kept them decent looking for at<br/>
least a few weeks.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I can certainly commiserate with this. I try to catch it before it happens -<br/>
it isn&#39;t a matter of hey I got something new let&#39;s go mess it up. It is a<br/>
matter of - I am a kid and I don&#39;t always think of the consequences I just<br/>
want to have fun. My son doesn&#39;t have to tell him what he is doing for every<br/>
moment of the day but I do ask that he tell me when he is going outside. I<br/>
allow him to go out in all kinds of weather as long as he isn&#39;t sick and it<br/>
isn&#39;t thundering outside - again all about safety. We will stand under the<br/>
deck roof to watch the storm together if he really wants to see it.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When he says, &quot;hey I am going outside.&quot; I look him over real quick and if he<br/>
has one of his nicer shirts, pants or shoes that we usually use to go<br/>
shopping or out to eat. I make the suggestion that maybe he might want to<br/>
change into something else. He usually wears his snow boots when it is<br/>
raining and after when it is still muddy. He likes wearing special stuff and<br/>
keeping stuff nice but he has even tested me. He had brand new shoes on just<br/>
bought from the store that day. He wanted to go out in the rain and I<br/>
suggested his boots. No, he wanted to wear the new ones. Okay, if that is<br/>
what he wanted. The were HIS shoes go outside and I will help you clean them<br/>
when they get dirty. He got to the end of the deck came back to the door and<br/>
said told me it was raining and he needed his boot on.lol.<br/>
