<div id="ygrps-yiv-2134116235">Wow!!  I am finding this conversation FASCINATING!  I too have just <br/>
begun unschooling my little ones - they&#39;re 2 and 3.  <br/>
<br/>
I am glad Judy freely put forth her day, and then I was glad about <br/>
all the replies it generated because reading these lists is how I&#39;m <br/>
learning about unschooling.  That said, I&#39;m glad it wasn&#39;t me who <br/>
caught the flack ;) !  Judy, I am so impressed that you hung in <br/>
there and remained open for conversation.  <br/>
<br/>
I have been struggling with the whole unschooling/nap and bedtime <br/>
issue and have been rooting around for some information out there <br/>
but not finding too much yet.  I have to admit I&#39;m totally reluctant <br/>
to give up naptimes- my girls take 3 hr. naps and it&#39;s the only <br/>
chance I have to get online (the computer&#39;s not accessible for me at <br/>
night).  But I have to coerce them to sleep... it&#39;s not usually <br/>
hard, but sometimes it is.  I suppose it could be argued that if <br/>
they nap that long, they&#39;ll surely continue to nap on their own, but <br/>
I&#39;m scared!  I need the breather myself.  ANYWAYS!  I know the <br/>
bottom line is that my gals learn to read their own signs.  I know <br/>
they can do it.  I&#39;m getting there...&gt;&gt;we&#39;re&lt;&lt; getting there...<br/>
<br/>
Thank all of you who wrote (and with eloquence and humor) to this <br/>
topic.  My brain began to crack open when I discovered unschooling, <br/>
and it&#39;s about to turn inside out now!! How refreshing!<br/>
<br/>
We live with my husband&#39;s parents who have opinions on everything <br/>
including the girls&#39; naptimes and Family Dinner.  Thanks to this <br/>
list, I&#39;m armed and ready and growing quite confident in my OWN <br/>
opinions!  	<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I spend a fair amount of time on AlwaysUnschooled... it is <br/>
absolutely fabulous.  <br/>

btw- is anyone aware of an unschooling-and-living-with-inlaws list??</div>

Ya know?  that is about the scariest thing I could think of doing - <br/>
that or my own parents.  &lt;shudder&gt;  You have a whole different set <br/>
of struggles to allow your daughters to grow up free from schooling!<br/>

asleep. If they&#39;re sleeping 3 hours, they clearly need it.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t be scared, be pro-active.<br/>
<br/>
How do you &quot;coerce&quot; anybody to sleep, anyway? Oh - you probably mean <br/>
that you force them to stay in their bed and once you do that, they <br/>
fall asleep?<br/>
<br/>
How about lying down with them? How about reading aloud? How about a <br/>
soothing cd or tape? I used to put on raucous music at first, because <br/>
my now-20 yo would resist even listening if she knew it was intended to <br/>
&#39;soothe&quot; her &lt;G&gt;. Then I&#39;d switch to something calmer and she would be <br/>
soothed and she&#39;d fall asleep.<br/>

really remember much) is my dad tape recorded himself reading our <br/>
favorite stories aloud. He&#39;d end each recording with kisses to each <br/>
of us. Mom would lay down with all 3 of us (she needed the nap just <br/>
as much since she&#39;s a cardiac patient, had a stroke when my little <br/>
sister was an infant, my brother was 3 and I was 5) and click play. <br/>
By the time the tape finished, we&#39;d all be asleep, comforted by the <br/>
sound of Daddy&#39;s voice. Bonus for Mom was she could relax too - she <br/>
didn&#39;t have to stay up to read to us.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1471032107">I am glad I am not the only one benefitting from my discomfort at having my<br/>
long-held beliefs pried open and poked and jabbed and torn to shreds.  :)<br/>
<br/>
The hardest part for me right now is realizing how many of my parenting<br/>
skills are, shall we say, less than ideal.  I love my children with all my<br/>
heart.  I want them to grow up to be happy, healthy and strong in all<br/>
aspects of life.  Now is a time when I need to apply the saying, &quot;I did what<br/>
I knew; then when I knew better, I did better.&quot;  That helps me to not beat<br/>
myself up over poor choices I amy have made in the past (I&#39;m really good at<br/>
beating myself up).  I am very much a show-me person.  I am a natural<br/>
skeptic.  But I also know that I am not perfect, and I will not get any<br/>
better if I don&#39;t view new ideas with an open mind.  It also helps if I am<br/>
shown how to take the first couple of steps so I know that I have the right<br/>
idea.  My personal learning method is to hear of or read mention of an idea,<br/>
then read about it and think about the logic behind the idea, then look for<br/>
scientific evidence or lots of anecdotal evidence, and finally to try it for<br/>
myself.  I think I am ready to make that last step.<br/>
