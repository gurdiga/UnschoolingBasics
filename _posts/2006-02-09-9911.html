<div id="ygrps-yiv-968524111">Thought it was about time to introduce myself, i have been following <br/>
the posts on here for the past couple of days...and already learned <br/>
alot. <br/>
<br/>
But first things first:  I am a mom of 4 wonderful, challenging <br/>
children..DS..13, DS..10, DS..5 and DD..3.<br/>
<br/>
 My DH is in the army and we are currently stationed in Germany.  <br/>
With him deployed to the desert,  i started homeschooling last year, <br/>
but fell into the thing about having a curriculm at first.  So we <br/>
ended up paying a huge tuiton to a school called bridgeway <br/>
academy....boy if i would have known, what i do now...we could have <br/>
went on a nice fieldtrip to Rome for that money..;)..LOL...anyway <br/>
long story, short:  my dear children hatet the curriculum and we <br/>
deceided to toss it.<br/>
<br/>
So on my quest to finding the right way to &quot;educate&quot; my children..I <br/>
came across the unkown term of unschooling. The more i read about it <br/>
the more i realized that this is exactly how i want my children to <br/>
learn, i want them to have fun while they learn what interests <br/>
them..while i learn with them.<br/>
<br/>
And just thru reading the various posts on here, i can already see <br/>
that my decision is the right one...i have already learned that <br/>
unschooling is not just a way of schooling..it really is a way of <br/>
life..so i want to thank all of you already for one thing:  THANK <br/>
YOU FOR OPENING MY EYES TO THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF UNSCHOOLING...AND <br/>
MY CHILDREN THANK YOU AS WELL :D<br/>
<br/>
This is getting lenghty so i will close, looking forward to reading <br/>
many more interesting posts..and maybe to put my 2 cents in every <br/>
once in a while.....Oh just one more thing, wondering if there are <br/>
any people on this list in germany? <br/>
