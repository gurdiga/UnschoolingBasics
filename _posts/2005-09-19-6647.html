Hi Kay,<br/>
Did you mean that in a &quot;coincidental&quot; way (LOL!) or did I post <br/>
something that made you think that?   (I&#39;m tired tonight and my brain <br/>
is not at it&#39;s best!).  Wow, they sound a lot alike!   She&#39;s not <br/>
currently on neopets, she started there, then moved to Disney toontown, <br/>
then found Runescape, and is almost exclusively on World of Warcraft <br/>
now (WOW) (software you purchase then also purchase a monthly online <br/>
membership, interactive).  I&#39;ll give her your dd&#39;s neopets info (I know <br/>
she has a user name but just hasn&#39;t been on it in a while), actually <br/>
just told her, she said she&#39;d check it out tomorrow, as she hasn&#39;t been <br/>
on in a while and would like to check in (I&#39;ll let you know what her <br/>
user name is).  Actually, we stopped toontown when she became intersted <br/>
in WOW, but just today (it&#39;s her 13th bday!) she reconnected with <br/>
someone she met on toontown via email and is thinking of rejoining <br/>
because there are some additions etc she wants to check out (has your <br/>
dd ever checked out toontown?).<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to email me offline too.  BTW, where are you located?<br/>

Hi Lyn!<br/>
I&#39;ll tell Danielle (who just turned 13 today!) about Emily and neopets <br/>
and get her user name info! (we can email it off line if you want <br/>
instead!)   Cool!<br/>

My name is Lynne,  and I&#39;m new to this group, but have been <br/>
unschooling my almost 12 (on Saturday)year-old daughter since she was <br/>
born.  <br/>
I apologise that I&#39;m not at all talkative on these boards, but I do  <br/>
get so much valuable information.  I guess that makes me a &quot;lurker&quot;. <br/>
Hope that&#39;s not too much of a sin. Anyway, What brought me out of my <br/>
hiding was the referral to Neopets.  My dd also plays and is also <br/>
always looking for other homeschoolers, particularly unschoolers to <br/>
talk with.  I gave her your daughter&#39;s user name, her&#39;s is <br/>
somersault91.  She has already mailed your dd, so you can let her know <br/>
to expect it.<br/>
Thanks to all,<br/>

<br/>
No way!   I lurked for a long time, just absorbing as we&#39;re really <br/>
new to unschooling (dd just finished 6th grade).  I began researching <br/>
homeschooling over 2 years ago and just discovered unschooling about <br/>
a year ago, so I had a lot to learn (and still learning)!  This is a <br/>
great group for newbies especially.<br/>

I&#39;ll let my dd know what your dd&#39;s user name is (that&#39;s 3 now!), you <br/>
probably saw that she hasn&#39;t been on it in a while (absorbed with <br/>
World of Warcraft right now) but she said she&#39;s check it out later <br/>
(don&#39;t know what her user name is but she can email everyone once she <br/>
gets on)<br/>

 <br/>
We are in Khadgar... I have 5 different characters and my husband has, oh,  <br/>
7, I think? We used to play Star Wars Galaxies, but left that after they  did a <br/>
major overhaul that just killed the game for us. A bunch of us left, and  <br/>
started a guild on WoW based off our city in SWG. We&#39;ve got our oldest member at  <br/>
age 65 and our youngest I believe is 17 right now. Makes for such a fun mix!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-5579143">Okay,  I, too, am a neopets player.  Started just a<br/>
few weeks ago.  I saw it listed on one of my<br/>
unschooling lists and checked it out.  DS is also<br/>
playing, but being just shy of 4 is not so into the<br/>
games right now, as into the care of his pets (and all<br/>
the wonderful spending involved).  DH is also a<br/>
member, but he has cut his activity back to playing<br/>
games for ds so he can spend it on exciting foods and<br/>
toys.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes we make unsual foods at home and refer to<br/>
them in Neopet terms ;)<br/>
