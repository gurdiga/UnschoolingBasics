<div id="ygrps-yiv-1297964535">This Saturday (8-26-6) at 1:00 PM is our unschooling pool party in Mashpee, <br/>
MA.   Activities may include: swimming, bocce, building sandcastles, <br/>
horseshoes, trampoline jumping, frisbee, bonfire (smores?) and whatever other fun stuff <br/>
people come up with.  We&#39;re up for almost anything.  Family baseball game?  <br/>
Bee-bee gun target shooting?  Sharpie body art? Bird watching? We had two <br/>
amazing woodpeckers in the yard today. How about an exciting woodworking project?  <br/>
We could really use a new rabbit hutch or a tree house!  A barn raising?  <br/>
Greased watermelon toss?<br/>
<br/>
We have 6 families coming and welcome others. E-mail me for directions if <br/>
you&#39;d like to join us.  <br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
Robin<br/>
