<div id="ygrps-yiv-1769976156">Well we went slipping and sliding between memphis and Jackson <br/>
yesterday then the rest of the way up to Nashville was easy. <br/>
Nashville is so pretty! I really wish we would have had more time to <br/>
stay and look around. <br/>
<br/>
All in all though it was a good trip and nice seeing the last of the <br/>
brothers married :)<br/>
