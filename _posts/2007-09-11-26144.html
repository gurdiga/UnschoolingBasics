<div id="ygrps-yiv-1989963962">Hi - <br/>
<br/>
I am new to the group.  Although we have always respected our <br/>
children&#39;s right to learn in their own time, it took me a bit longer <br/>
to completely &quot;see the light&quot; and respect the children&#39;s ability to <br/>
LIVE without my (and my husbands) telling them exactly HOW to do <br/>
it.  We were always more &quot;lenient&quot; than most parents.  For example, <br/>
when they were younger, we would not eat or drink in front of them <br/>
and tell them they could not eat or drink the same thing.  We also <br/>
would assume the child knew his/her comfort level and didn&#39;t force <br/>
them to wear coats (or any other clothing item an adult would feel <br/>
is necessary depending on the weather).  In these small, everyday <br/>
items, we backed off (much to grandma&#39;s chagrin!) and let the <br/>
chidren make their own choices.  We still don&#39;t dictate bedtime, <br/>
mealtime (other than a sit-down together dinner), etc.<br/>
<br/>
So...I feel many things are being handled in a positive, respectful <br/>
manner.  My struggle in this quest is applying a lot of <br/>
the &quot;unschooling in life&quot; principles that I admire to a family with <br/>
five children.  I don&#39;t have five different-aged children, I had a <br/>
set of quadruplets (they are 8) and a single child 18 months later <br/>
(he is 6).  So basically, I have a small classroom in my house.  I <br/>
understand most people here are not in the same position, but <br/>
perhaps there are a few on this list who have 3+ children who are <br/>
close in age?  The problems I run into basically stem from one <br/>
source: peer pressure and/or distraction of peers.  Five children <br/>
all the same age distract each other.  They are not abnormally <br/>
distracted for their age, they just multiply it times 5.<br/>
<br/>
So, I love the idea of not requiring chores, of leading by example, <br/>
etc.  But here is a common scenario.<br/>
<br/>
Mom:  Hey guys, the house is getting trashed, and we need to go to <br/>
chess class (for two of the boys). Could you help me pick up a room <br/>
or two before we go?<br/>
<br/>
Kids:  We&#39;re in the middle of playing Pokemon, just started a book, <br/>
etc....can we do it in a little bit?<br/>
<br/>
Mom:  Sure.  How about in 20 minutes we do it?<br/>
<br/>
(In these 20 minutes, I may start picking up, hoping to teach by <br/>
example...)<br/>
<br/>
Mom:  OK guys, its been 20 minutes.  Could you help me now?<br/>
<br/>
Kids:  OK!<br/>
<br/>
Two minutes later, two are arguing over who gets to pick up Lego&#39;s <br/>
(which I let them deal with - they actually are fairly good at <br/>
conflict resolution among themselves, but of course, this takes time <br/>
away from cleaning), one found a transformer he is playing with and <br/>
two are doing all the work themselves.  Of course, these two are not <br/>
that happy about the situation because they want to help out, but <br/>
others are not so they get angry and stop helping.  I defer to the <br/>
time, we leave for chess class and nothing really was cleaned.  Not <br/>
a big deal by itself, I can let the room stay messy, but it is a <br/>
metaphor for how EVERYTHING gets done in our house.<br/>
<br/>
Another situation:<br/>
<br/>
One child REALLY wants to take choir.  I find her a choir class, but <br/>
the parents have to stay on the premises.  It&#39;s a co-op, so I ask <br/>
the other kids if they would like to take a class, too.  They all <br/>
pick a class, enjoy themselves for a few weeks, then one decides he <br/>
doesn&#39;t like it anymore.  We talk about it and he makes the decision <br/>
to stop attending the class.  Now one of his brothers, who was in a <br/>
different class and liking it, doesn&#39;t want to &quot;have&quot; to go either.  <br/>
Not because he doesn&#39;t enjoy the class, but because its not fair <br/>
that his brother isn&#39;t and he is.  OK.  Two are not in classes.  <br/>
This is fine, except these two don&#39;t like going to the co-op now <br/>
because they don&#39;t have anything to do.  They will bring things <br/>
with, but get bored easily because they have to stay in a certain <br/>
area quietly until their siblings are done with class.  We don&#39;t <br/>
make them sit quietly at home, so this is hard for them, even though <br/>
they &quot;get&quot; why they could be disruptive to other people who are <br/>
trying to enjoy their classes.  Now its three who want to be there, <br/>
two who don&#39;t, and me trying to respect everyone&#39;s needs.  <br/>
<br/>
This co-op situation is not the end of the world, and we are working <br/>
on their ability to quietly entertain themselves.  They will find a <br/>
comfortable arrangement in time, I know.  BUT it is a good example <br/>
of how hard it is to balance everyone&#39;s needs without &quot;making&quot; some <br/>
of the kids do something they don&#39;t want to do.  I have considered a <br/>
sitter, but we don&#39;t have a daytime sitter available, and even if I <br/>
did, I couldn&#39;t afford to pay a sitter every time one child wanted <br/>
to take a class and the others did not.  One may not want to go to <br/>
the library, but four do. They have to learn some give and take, <br/>
because that&#39;s how large families function.  Does anyone have any <br/>
advice on this front?  How did you balance everyones needs?  <br/>
<br/>
Another big concern is keeping the house clean and the chores done.  <br/>
I used to make them do chores, and although they never really <br/>
grumbled about doing them (they were so used to it - they had been <br/>
doing chores since they were 3 and they were fun then!), I backed <br/>
off from this in an effort to reduce my being an authority figure.  <br/>
It has been a year now, and here is the problem.  The odds of the <br/>
kids WANTING to help me clean are really low, because they would <br/>
much rather play with the kids who are doing something else.  Even <br/>
if they do start to help, something exciting happens and the <br/>
cleaning never actually gets done.  The idea of &quot;I (Mom) am the one <br/>
who wants it clean, so I have to clean it if they don&#39;t want to <br/>
help&quot; is a hard one for me to swallow, because seven people in one <br/>
house makes things extremely dirty.  Yes, we will live in stench if <br/>
the toilets aren&#39;t cleaned (four boys &lt;g&gt;), and everything will be <br/>
cluttered to the point of distraction if we don&#39;t work together to <br/>
clean it up. So the idea of leading by example is lost because the <br/>
distractibility level in the house is so high, they don&#39;t notice <br/>
and/or hear Mom&#39;s needs.  When they do, they help.  It&#39;s just few <br/>
and far between.<br/>
<br/>
The same problem lies in the TV and video games.  This is the one <br/>
area in which I have not given up control, and here is why:  If one <br/>
child watches TV or plays a video game, they all watch.  Taking <br/>
turns takes ALL day if they are unlimited.  Literally.  One child <br/>
does not appreciate video games, and can entertain herself for <br/>
awhile, but then can be reduced to tears because her brothers ignore <br/>
her ALL DAY.  I can find things to do with her to a point, and she <br/>
can entertain herself to a point, but she gets depressed because she <br/>
really just wants to do stuff with her brothers.  Two of the boys, <br/>
then, get really crabby and depressed when they &quot;do media&quot; all day.  <br/>
They don&#39;t eat well (they do if they don&#39;t play games), don&#39;t sleep <br/>
well and become really disrespectful to everyone else in the house.  <br/>
How do other people balance this?  I tried letting it run its course <br/>
about 6 months ago, and it was one of the worst two months we have <br/>
ever had as a family.  My husband finally put an end to it and I am <br/>
so happy he did, because our lives literally turned around in many <br/>
ways once we limited the boys to 1/2 hour a day (so two hours total <br/>
of &quot;media time&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
So basically, and I am sorry for this being so long and more a <br/>
storyline than questions, I would like to hear other people&#39;s <br/>
solutions to radical unschooling with large families.  I admire many <br/>
of the ideas and solutions I see on this sight, but it seems they <br/>
don&#39;t always work in my house.  I feel like I have to place some <br/>
limits that I don&#39;t want to be placing and make the kids do some <br/>
things they don&#39;t want to be doing.  Has anyone else tried methods I <br/>
may have not thought about?  I see how well unschooling has worked <br/>
towards their academics and brain development, but it doesn&#39;t seem <br/>
to be applying in all regards of life like I want it to.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone needs me to be more specific, please ask.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-737017373">I certainly do not have a large family to draw experience from, but<br/>
definitely one that needs improvement and deals with conflicting<br/>
needs. Could holding family brainstorming sessions work, to come up<br/>
with solutions to the problems you have been having? If the kids were<br/>
the ones to come up with solutions it might &quot;feel&quot; better for<br/>
everyone. Maybe a once a week meeting to work on these things.<br/>
<br/>
I read a great book on Nonviolent Communication by Marshall Rosenberg<br/>
[Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life: Create Your Life, Your<br/>
Relationships, and Your World in Harmony with Your Values (Nonviolent<br/>
Communication Guides)] that might be helpful in helping everyone<br/>
getting their needs met with out ignoring others or having feelings<br/>
hurt, etc.<br/>

Sadly, I have not gotten a chance to read any of these yet, though I<br/>
was so impressed by two other booklets and the main NVC book that I am<br/>
sure these are good (someone else correct me, if I am wrong).<br/>
<br/>
You might try sharing with them some tools to help with their<br/>
brainstorming and try it a couple times with them, and then give the<br/>
them the problem and let them have the sessions on their own at some<br/>
point without mom or dad. It would be cool to see what they came up<br/>
with. You might want to say that you are really open to their ideas<br/>
and then they can work on refining the solution that they present to<br/>
you and dad or if there is some limitation that they need to know<br/>
about (time, money, logistics, etc.), let them know about it and tell<br/>
them to go back to brainstorming with this info and see how they can<br/>
work that into the solution. I hope I am explaining myself clearly<br/>
enough. Let them know it can be really crazy and fun. They could get a<br/>
big piece of paper and markers and write things down or whatever. You<br/>
offer to do the writing down without adding imput unless they ask or<br/>
you could help facilites and help them refine as they go. Well, you<br/>
know what your kids might like best, but if everyone doesn&#39;t feel like<br/>
they are sharing in the solution making because they didn&#39;t feel like<br/>
they were heard for example, that might be a topic for a brainstorming<br/>
session with a parental facilitator.<br/>

Hope this helps,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1912904263">Thanks, Talia - I am going to check out the first book you mentioned.  We have had family brainstorming sessions in the past, but the kids seemed to have a hard time participating, perhaps because they were still uncomfortable with the idea.  I never thought to find a book on the subject.  Perhaps that will teach me how to broach the subject to them in a better way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-161978752">The book is not about brainstorming per se, but will probably help you<br/>
express your feeling and your needs without making them feel as<br/>
uncomfortable and it will help everyone get what they need by being<br/>
able to speak more effectively during the discussions.<br/>
<br/>
Of course you don&#39;t want to force them to do this, but maybe they are<br/>
a little older than they were before and they will be more up for it?<br/>
<br/>
best of luck!!<br/>
