<div id="ygrps-yiv-2029163235">I hope this is ok to post something like this!  I just had this great  idea <br/>
if its workable.   We got some sample copies of Life Learning  Magazine at a <br/>
conference back in March.  I LOVE IT  but its just not  in the budget right now. <br/>
 I was thinking if someone else got it and wanted  to share some of the cost <br/>
and then send it on to me.  It was so Inspiring  to have that hard copy to <br/>
share with family and read before going to bed!   Thought id give it a shot!  <br/>
Thanks<br/>
