  I read at Joyce&#39;s that you might be willing to answer questions about <br/>
kids trying out drugs. I always wonder about this, because I tried <br/>
marijuana back then as well and always wondered what I would do about <br/>
it since I got a kid. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a terrible drug, though. It&#39;s <br/>
kind of like alcohol and when I was younger, I thought it wasn&#39;t even <br/>
as damaging as alcohol. More than about these kind of drugs I have <br/>
wondered about cigarettes. Funny enough; I always thought it would be <br/>
senseless to forbid it, because then they would even more want to try <br/>
it! Why didn&#39;t I think of applying this thought to everything else? <br/>
Duh. <br/>
 <br/>
  If you are willing and not totally annoyed by me, my question would <br/>
be, how you handled this situation. <br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Cigarettes? or drugs?<br/>
<br/>
It really doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;s the whole forbidden fruit thing. Forbid <br/>
it, and you can rest assured that they will try it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve often said that about reading! &lt;g&gt; &quot;How can I get my son to read?&quot; <br/>
  Forbid it! Ban books in the home! Burn all written materials! Refuse <br/>
to sound out or spell *any*thing for him! VERY good chance the child <br/>
will be SEEKING books to read---and in private! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Same with drugs, alcohol, tobacco and sex---and any other sticky thing. <br/>
Ban it, and you&#39;re setting yourself up for failure. *Talk* about it, <br/>
make it a regular part of your discussions, and be open and <br/>
honest---and not only will your child not *hide* it, he may not try it <br/>
at all. Well myabe not the sex part! &lt;g&gt; That&#39;s almost guaranteed!<br/>
<br/>
Cameron has never smoked cigarettes. All three of his band-mates and <br/>
several of his friends smoke.<br/>
<br/>
He got dangerously drunk one night---his 15th birthday. He&#39;s never done <br/>
that again. He&#39;ll have an occasional beer or glass of wine with us, but <br/>
no more bingeing.<br/>
<br/>
He smoked a good bit of pot just after he left school---all his friends <br/>
were doing it, etc. I&#39;ve never smoked marijuana. My husband did. We <br/>
were very up-front and honest about our feelings. Oddly, Ben was more <br/>
concerned about it than I was. My suggestions were to only smoke GOOD <br/>
stuff---to know where it came from---no &quot;I bought it on the street <br/>
corner&quot; stuff. Never buy from strangers. Never smoke out in the open. <br/>
Never smoke IN my house! Never smoke on front of his little brother. BE <br/>
SMART about it. Never, ever, ever drive while under the influence of <br/>
drugs or alcohol.<br/>
<br/>
IF he were high or drunk, please call us and we&#39;ll pick him up. NEVER <br/>
drive!!!!! Never ride with someone who was high/drunk!!! I would drop <br/>
what I was doing and come get him (and friends)---NO QUESTIONS ASKED!!!<br/>
<br/>
His safety and freedom were at the center of all this. Of utmost <br/>
importance!!! I didn&#39;t want him dead or incapacitated or in <br/>
jail/prison. NOTHING was worth those options. Nothing!!!<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t care why/where/with whom. He could call me day or night. He <br/>
could also let me know he was staying over at a friend&#39;s house if he <br/>
were too wasted to come home.<br/>
<br/>
One day I was letting him off at a concert. I didn&#39;t tell him, &quot;Don&#39;t <br/>
drink or do drugs!&quot;---I said, &quot;If you do, be SMART about it!&quot;  He <br/>
laughed, knowing how many parents would say the former! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Our relationship is VERY open and honest. We talk a LOT about stuff. <br/>
Nothing is taboo. He&#39;s comfortable asking me anything---and I&#39;m <br/>
comfortable saying exactly how I feel about the topic. That started <br/>
when he was very young.<br/>
<br/>
About the pot: I asked him to do a little research on it. My father is <br/>
a psychiatrist and was the &quot;authority&quot; on drug usage in the US when I <br/>
was a child---flew all over the country advising doctors and such on <br/>
drug use and all. I knew all the bad things. I suggested that Cameron <br/>
prove my dad wrong. &lt;g&gt; He knew every website about the benefits of <br/>
marijuana---AND hemp! &lt;g&gt; We&#39;re now big hemp fans! But he did serious <br/>
research on marijuana and countered most of what my father had told me <br/>
as a child. He became a member of NORML (I suggested that he not sign <br/>
anything, however! &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t smoke any more. He found it made him feel bad. &lt;G&gt; Well, not <br/>
as good the *next* day---the initial feeling was still pretty good, he <br/>
says. But he&#39;s not smoking any more---HIS choice, not mine. I&#39;m now <br/>
convinced it ain&#39;t bad shit---I still haven&#39;t ever smoked though! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But forbidding it WON&#39;T stop it. Knowledge of it&#39;s benefits AND <br/>
hazards. Open, honest communication. Acceptance of his choice---even if <br/>
it goes against your views. Oh---and laughter and humor go a long way!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think the goal should be that your child *never* tries <br/>
drugs/cigarettes/alcohol, but that he&#39;s smart about it and gets his <br/>
questions answered.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps. I&#39;m going to post it on UB just because it could be <br/>
helpful to others too. I&#39;d be happy to answer any more questions you <br/>
might have---specific or general---or whatever!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1020565078">Interesting question. I like Kelly&#39;s answer and I HOPE I handle it <br/>
like that when/if that time ever comes.  <br/>
The &quot;sex, drugs & rock & roll&quot; lifestyle was something my husband & <br/>
I were *heavily* involved in early in our relationship. It&#39;s <br/>
actually how we met. We&#39;ve abused more than our fair share of hard <br/>
drugs over the years and although that&#39;s behind us know, we still <br/>
smoke marijuana on occasions when we&#39;re away from our kids. <br/>
I would be honest with my kids about it, and being we have <br/>
experience with it, I would be able to tell them &quot;the good, the bad <br/>
and the ugly&quot; of what *we* lived through. I spent two years in drug <br/>
rehabilitation when I was younger and although it hasn&#39;t come up <br/>
yet, I plan on telling them about my experience there because it <br/>
made me the person I am today.  <br/>
