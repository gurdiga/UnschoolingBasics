<div id="ygrps-yiv-1318830091">I has been reading both sides of this. Let me share my situation. <br/>
<br/>
 My daughter is almost 5 and for the last 6 months we have done away <br/>
with bed times. I can say that durring this time I have felt so out <br/>
of sorts. She stays up till past 2am, and gets up at 9am. I was used <br/>
to going to bed at midnight and getting up with her. No matter what <br/>
time she goes to bed she seems to get up at the same time. In 6 <br/>
months, having to stay up as late as my child to make shure she is <br/>
safe, my sleep scedual is a mess and my daughter is grumpy as ever <br/>
and is now in a fight everything phase. You give her what she asks <br/>
for and she screams at us for something else. Giving her control has <br/>
seemed to do little more then make her attitude worse. With Hubby <br/>
working couble shifts, and my lack of self countrol, like my <br/>
daughters, I am going to bed at 7am and sleeping till 5pm, leaving <br/>
my roomate who hates unschooling to watch my daughter for me. I hate <br/>
this, but I can not seem to fix my sleeping scedual. I am going to <br/>
try very hard to be in bed by 2am, but that means my daughter needs <br/>
to be. I am too worn out to clean up another 3am tea party of hers. <br/>
I only have so much energy. <br/>
<br/>
 Right now I am really thinking that she, as well as I, need a bed <br/>
time so we can function fully in the world and be happy. <br/>
<br/>
  Everyone is different, and I am seeing it as a great danger to my <br/>
family to be so unstructered. My daughter does not seem to like <br/>
having all these choices. I know personally, I do not always know <br/>
what is good for me or how to get it. I know I am asking friend and <br/>
family to help me get my day time night time life back together for <br/>
the betterment of all. Some kids do not know how to ask for that <br/>
help, does not mean they do not need it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2111050002">Hi, Kimmy,<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you are in quite a difficult spot with your bedtime<br/>
situation!  Getting no sleep or giving up time during the day to sleep<br/>
yourself, and living with a grumpy daughter is certainly a situation I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t want to be in.  I can understand why you are feeling like limits<br/>
were better!  If you sincerely feel that you just need to go back to setting<br/>
a bedtime, then I respect that is where you are at.  If you feel you&#39;d like<br/>
to find some kind of alternate arrangement where your daughter can still<br/>
have some choice and autonomy and where you can also get your needs met,<br/>
then I have a few thoughts for you to consider.<br/>
<br/>
You mentioned that you feel compelled to stay up with your daughter to make<br/>
sure she is safe.  One of the things that works well for me to get my kids<br/>
(5 & 3) to bed in a non-coercive way when they really do seem flat out tired<br/>
is for me to head to bed myself.  How would you feel about trying that for a<br/>
few nights and seeing if she follows?  You can lie there awake and listen<br/>
for any problems - certainly if my kids are not tired they could care less<br/>
if I&#39;m in bed generally, but if they are tired (and it sounds like with her<br/>
clock set off to get up early all the time, your daughter could be<br/>
overtired) mine do follow and I&#39;m wondering if your daughter might do the<br/>
same.<br/>
<br/>
Another option I&#39;d explore in your situation which I&#39;ve been in with other<br/>
issues, but not bedtime ones, is talking to her about the situation and your<br/>
feelings.  Let her know what you observe about her grumpiness, that it&#39;s<br/>
more fun for Mom when she is not grumpy, that you need more sleep, and see<br/>
if you can all come up with a solution together.  Maybe you can agree on a<br/>
time at night to start &quot;winding down&quot; in bed.  I know for me agreements that<br/>
take into consideration all our needs may feel better than my imposing rules<br/>
and they leave the door open to changes and future discussions.  Could be<br/>
that after a while your daughter&#39;s clock will get deregulated and allow her<br/>
to sleep in.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you do not feel that these suggestions are attacking your decisions.<br/>
I respect whatever decision you feel you need to make, but it sounds like<br/>
you see some benefit to your daughter having choices and feeling involved<br/>
and I think you may be able to get your needs met without going back to<br/>
setting a bedtime if you desire to do so.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>
Joan<br/>

to be. I am too worn out to clean up another 3am tea party of hers. <br/>
I only have so much energy. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I want to make sure I am understanding you.<br/>
 <br/>
Your almost 5yo is sleeping a pretty predictable if unorthodox schedule, but<br/>
you are not on the same one. She is getting less than 7 hours of sleep per<br/>
night, and then you are basically putting her into an uncongenial day care<br/>
situation in order to get sufficient rest yourself of about 10 hours.<br/>
Somewhere here there is another daughter or was that a typo?<br/>
<br/>
You sound like you are feeling very frustrated, very alone, and perhaps<br/>
unsupported by your dh - not intentionally but because he is out of the<br/>
house. <br/>
<br/>
I would immediately suspect, very strongly, that it is being left with your<br/>
roommate for 8+ hours on a daily basis and you unavailable, and her strongly<br/>
desiring more interaction with you, that is causing more of the behavior and<br/>
attitude problems, than being &quot;given choices&quot;. You do not describe what her<br/>
activities are like during that time, only that the care-giver &quot;hates&quot;<br/>
unschooling. Yikes!<br/>
<br/>
However, I also think when control is relaxed suddenly it can be like a<br/>
rubber band snapping, instead of a window gently opening (mixed metaphor but<br/>
I think it does the job). You said that she is &quot;still grumpy&quot;, which makes<br/>
me think that you were using sleep choices as a solution to a specific<br/>
problem. Perhaps you mis-identified the cause of the grumpiness, since it is<br/>
still there, and the real cause is something else. <br/>
<br/>
Jayn gets really grumpy with her Daddy when he has been spending a lot of<br/>
time out of the house (while she is awake). He makes a special effort to<br/>
reconnect with her, pretty much not reacting emotionally to her &quot;go aways&quot;<br/>
and raspberries, in favor of asking her if she is upset, and why, and would<br/>
she like to go wrestle (their special game) for a while (&quot;Yes! Let&#39;s<br/>
wrestle!&quot;). That helps more than getting angry at her for being<br/>
developmentally unable to just say, &quot;Gee I missed you, can you give me some<br/>
of your time and attention for a while?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Everyone is different, and I am seeing it as a great danger to my <br/>
family to be so unstructered. My daughter does not seem to like <br/>
having all these choices.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I only saw you mention one relaxed choice - bedtimes. It seems that in one<br/>
other important area, when she can get your attention, she has no choices<br/>
whatsoever. That sounds harsh. I don&#39;t mean it to be, because it sounds to<br/>
me like you are on the right track of asking your loved ones to help YOU get<br/>
back into rhythm with your child. Demanding that *she* change may not be as<br/>
workable. Is she getting enough sleep? Is there some external factor waking<br/>
her at 9am? Is she in the same bed as you are? What is keeping *you* up if<br/>
she is going to bed between 2 and 3, other than just being on a bad<br/>
schedule? Was there some major event to push you to 7am?<br/>
<br/>
Not getting much day/sunlight also makes me feel more tired than otherwise,<br/>
but we are on a rotating schedule so my night living is brief. When I am<br/>
extra tired I make an effort to move more gently, to keep reminding myself<br/>
that I am tired and so to think carefully before I speak. I also tell Jayn<br/>
and dh that I am feeling tired, so that I can stem some of the requests that<br/>
way. Nor do I bother with tidying up Jayn&#39;s last couple of games before bed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As someone who has done a lot of odd changing shift work in my time,<br/>
including working graveyard for a long time in an all night café, I can tell<br/>
you that in trying to switch your schedule, going to bed before you are<br/>
sleepy is futile without pharmaceutical help of some kind. My dh swears by<br/>
melatonin. The best thing I and many of my colleagues in the film biz have<br/>
found, is to force yourself to stay awake &quot;around the clock&quot; once, until the<br/>
desired &quot;normal&quot; bedtime is reached. In your case that might be when your dd<br/>
is going to bed - at around 2am. <br/>
<br/>
My suggestion would be to organize your baby-sitter just for the around<br/>
three hours of overlap from when she gets up at 9am until you want to get up<br/>
at 12.00, if you still need 10 hours. Sometimes sleeping a lot longer than<br/>
usual is a sign of depression.<br/>
<br/>
I totally sympathize with the desire to be near dd when she is awake. I<br/>
mentioned in my other post that I lie down on the sofa near Jayn. Can you<br/>
have a really special enjoyable activity that she can do in the bedroom near<br/>
your bed (if that is where you sleep) to allow you to at least snooze? <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;I know personally, I do not always know <br/>
what is good for me or how to get it. I know I am asking friend and <br/>
family to help me get my day time night time life back together for <br/>
the betterment of all. Some kids do not know how to ask for that <br/>
help, does not mean they do not need it!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m worried that you are mixing a bunch of issues into one maelstrom of<br/>
difficulty. You may not be aware of how much you are using some very<br/>
negative self-talk and negative self-labeling, and that you are sliding<br/>
these across to your kids - possibly without real foundation. Being<br/>
&quot;contrary&quot; is a great part of being almost 5 years old. It doesn&#39;t mean that<br/>
she will always lack self control. Do you have a friend or someone with whom<br/>
you could talk about your own issues, outside of parenting?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2037818544">Personally I believe that kids do need some bounderies and when they <br/>
do not get them, they act out as your dd is doing.  You can give them <br/>
freedom and let the learn as they learn, but they are also part of a <br/>
family and the family has to be able to function.  Even the &quot;famiy&quot; <br/>
has routine to follow and rules they have to follow and it is <br/>
important that our kids learn that life has rules that they will have <br/>
to follow.  Setting some bounderies with the understanding that it is <br/>
not a punishment but so the whole family can function in a better way-<br/>
-you know, cooperation, working together-- isn&#39;t a bad thing.  I am <br/>
not saying you have to set up strict rules or anything like that, but <br/>
finding ways that will work involving the whole family in the <br/>
decision making.  This way she is part of the decision and has say in <br/>
the choices and sees/understands what is going on and why.  <br/>
<br/>
I hope that makes sense.  What I am trying to say is really hard to <br/>
put into words.  :)<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have set bedtimes, but our little girls (ages 6yr and 2yr) <br/>
tend to fall asleep early and we carry them off to the family bed.  <br/>
Our older ds (15yr) chooses when he is ready for bed and ready for <br/>
sleep.  We had bedtimes for the kids when they were in PS, but as <br/>
homeschoolers/unschoolers, we don&#39;t need them.  Which we LOVE!!!<br/>
<br/>
Have you tried having your dd come lay down with you at a certain <br/>
time for bed.  Turn out the lights and let her wrestle around until <br/>
she falls into slumber?  This might be an easy way to start getting <br/>
her used to falling asleep earlier.  Just a thought.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-800417626">Joan, I do think your understanding where I am coming from in this. <br/>
I am very agrivated with how we all seem to drained from lack of <br/>
sleep and I asume lack of scedual. I know personally I like being <br/>
able to count on certain things through out the day. I know before <br/>
Crystal used to get very upset at 5pm when Daddy normally came home <br/>
but then didn&#39;t. Now with him working double shift, we have no idea <br/>
when he will start or come home. Chances are though, Crystal feeds <br/>
off of my emotions at those times even if I think I am not showing <br/>
them. Best she learns to go with what happens, unlike me, having been <br/>
programmed to find comfort in the systems. <br/>
<br/>
  Ok, so we can not force change on anyone. So trying to change my <br/>
daughters sleep patterns is not likely to work. I have to leave her <br/>
to learn for herself by providing a good example. I think that going <br/>
to bed and staying awake to listen is worth trying. If nothing else I <br/>
read in bed as is, and it could provide me good wind down time on her <br/>
scedual. I can change myself, though the will power has not been my <br/>
strong point in this battle against the sleep demon! I always asumed <br/>
I had to go to bed after her.... {shaked head free of clouds} it <br/>
still amazes me how many things I asume about life must be true <br/>
simply because that is how I saw things growing up. <br/>
<br/>
 I do want my child to have choices, and to know that her needs and <br/>
wants are just as important as mine. I am finding it hard though <br/>
drawing the line between as important and more important seeing she <br/>
seems to demand that her needs and wants are more important than mine <br/>
and I very much do not like having to say no to her. <br/>
<br/>
 Example: I am ill... still not sure how badly. But I get sick, alot. <br/>
And when I go to the bath room to get sick I lock the door, I need my <br/>
space for many times I end up a crumble on the floor in tears. I do <br/>
not want anyone to see that. My daughter demands to come in, and <br/>
pounds on the door, and just will not give me a moments peace. <br/>
Picture me getting sick and yelling at her to go play.... Lots of <br/>
Stress.<br/>
<br/>
 Blessings,<br/>

Why not just let her in?  Maybe she&#39;s really worried about you and is <br/>
scared of what &quot;scary&quot; thing is happening behind the door that makes <br/>
Mama cry.  Then you wouldn&#39;t have to be yelling at her and she wouldn&#39;t <br/>
be pounding on the door.  If she doesn&#39;t want to watch you throw up <br/>
then she&#39;s not likely to follow you in there again.  KWIM?  OTOH, she <br/>
may want to &quot;be there&quot; for you as you would be for her if she was <br/>
sick/throwing up/sad.  Maybe she&#39;s panicking because she&#39;s not able to <br/>
get to you to help and comfort you.  Just a few thoughts.  :)<br/>

Hey, Kimberley,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really sorry to hear you&#39;re sick and I hear what you are saying - it&#39;s<br/>
so hard when your needs and your kids needs are not the same!  And I know<br/>
that for me, I give so much because I care of course, often deferring my own<br/>
desires and needs, so that when I have something that feels really<br/>
important - like the bathroom situation you described for you - that is<br/>
about my needs, I often feel quite frustrated that my kids seem unable to<br/>
just &quot;get it&quot; that yes I do need this!<br/>
<br/>
I have found out through trial and error that my kids can&#39;t tune in like<br/>
another adult to sense my needs, much as I&#39;d like them to, but that if I<br/>
talk to them and make the needs clear in a way they can understand then<br/>
their ability to care about my needs and respond to them is amazing.  So if<br/>
I had the stress of your bathroom situation and I wanted to get rid of that<br/>
stress but get my privacy, I&#39;d find a time when I was feeling better to talk<br/>
to my daughter about the situation - I&#39;d let my daughter know that I<br/>
understand her desire to be with me and know what&#39;s going on behind a closed<br/>
door.  Then to take the mystery away I&#39;d describe that I was sick and<br/>
feeling awful and that I needed some time alone and ask her if there was<br/>
something she could do while Mommy was feeling that way so that I could have<br/>
that privacy.  Even if we didn&#39;t come up with something that felt<br/>
definitive, my experience is that I&#39;d hear how much she cared, I&#39;d her<br/>
trying as best she could and that would likely be enough to take the edge<br/>
off my frustration.<br/>
<br/>
The other day we had a scenario where my daughter, 5.7, defied my<br/>
expectations with her ability to choose to defer her wants to meet her 3 yr<br/>
old brother&#39;s and mine.  My husband had just come home from work and I was<br/>
trying to get out to go jogging.  I&#39;d already deferred the jog from the<br/>
morning before when my son, who is usually touchy but okay with me going,<br/>
had really dug in his heels and wailed and expressed how much he needed me<br/>
to not go.  He&#39;d agreed that this evening when Daddy got home would work<br/>
better so I&#39;d agreed to wait a day.  I&#39;d reminded him about it, and he<br/>
seemed fine.  Then Dad got home with a video from the library (where he<br/>
works) for each kid.  My daughter put hers on to watch.  A few minutes later<br/>
my son came in to where I was putting on my jogging things and said &quot;Bill<br/>
Nye is too long, Mama&quot;.  I said &quot;Oh, you&#39;re waiting to watch your video and<br/>
you feel like Aline&#39;s Bill Nye video is too long for you to wait?&quot;  He said<br/>
&quot;Yes&quot;.  I said &quot;Well Aline&#39;s video has two stories.  How about if she<br/>
watches one story, you watch your video, then she watches the other story?&quot;<br/>
This has worked in the past and he trotted off seemingly happy enough.  A<br/>
few minutes later I heard him bawling to my confused husband in front of the<br/>
TV set.  I went in and asked him what was going on.  He kept crying.  I said<br/>
&quot;Are you just wanting to watch your video first?&quot;  He cried &quot;Yes!&quot;  I<br/>
expressed his desire to my daughter who said &quot;Well I want to watch mine<br/>
first&quot;.  So I offered what we do a lot - a &quot;fair&quot; way of deciding where I<br/>
put the videos under a towel or behind my back and a kid picks which hand or<br/>
towel and that one is first.  That usually works, but today Nicky was having<br/>
a tough time and just wasn&#39;t going for it.  He wanted to know which hand his<br/>
video was in.  He just wanted it NOW.  I was getting frustrated - would I<br/>
ever get out on this run?  What about my needs?  I could choose to just walk<br/>
out, and leave them to Dad who is not as patient as I, but I know the trauma<br/>
that would feel like to my child.  So I said to my daughter, &quot;Aline, I know<br/>
what I&#39;m about to ask you is not the fair way.  But Nicky is super cranky,<br/>
he really wants his video first today and is having a tough time.  I&#39;d<br/>
really like to get out on my run now which I&#39;ve been waiting to go on.  I&#39;d<br/>
really appreciate it if you could reconsider and let him have his video<br/>
first.  What do you say?&quot;  And she shocked me and said &quot;Well, okay, Mom.&quot;<br/>
I&#39;m so glad I didn&#39;t blow my top.<br/>
