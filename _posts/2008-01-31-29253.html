 </span></blockquote>Unschooling in general is &quot;not school&quot; - it is a different educational <br/>
philosophy that encompasses all of life, hence it is often called life <br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;radical&quot; gets tacked on when the philosophy of trusting children to <br/>
learn is extended to the rest of life, not just &quot;schooling&quot;. Trusting <br/>
children in regard to food, sleep, etc.<br/>
<br/>
It is possible to unschool &quot;academically&quot; - that is, trust that your <br/>
child(ren) will learn what they need to in the academic sense when and <br/>
how they need to without applying that to the rest of life, thus you&#39;d <br/>
have children who are free to learn to read, to manage numbers, to <br/>
explore the world, etc in whatever manner and timeframe suits them BUT <br/>
they are at the same time regulated as to when to eat, what to eat, <br/>
when to sleep, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
Generally, it&#39;s often easier for us grown ups to wrap our heads around <br/>
unschooling academically (though that&#39;s also not easy) than to <br/>
comprehend that kids will grow just fine without being forced to bed <br/>
at 8:30 pm because mom and dad think they should be in bed at 8:30 pm <br/>
regardless of whether they are tired or not.<br/>

I think it is definitely easier to accept. I just don&#39;t see how that <br/>
would actually *WORK*!<br/>
<br/>
Children may be ignorant, but they&#39;re not stupid. ANd even *they* will <br/>
begin to question these things eventually. What will the parents&#39; <br/>
answer be? &quot;Yes, I think you&#39;re smart and capable enough to learn <br/>
higher math and grammar, but I don&#39;t trust you to know when your body&#39;s <br/>
tired or hungry. So, I&#39;ll make all those decisions FOR you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
*I* still can&#39;t wrap my head around THAT! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt; What happens when the child asks why all the rules?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perhaps, parents can explain WHY the rules.  We have maintained a<br/>
reasonable bedtime, without fuss or bother, it is because we all<br/>
function better that way.  DH has to get up in order to go to work,<br/>
and someone mentioned (on another list) that having regular times in<br/>
the week, but going to bed late and sleeping late every weekend is<br/>
like having jetlag every week.  <br/>
<br/>
I think there can be something between strict, &quot;You do x,y,z when and<br/>
how I say, because I say&quot; and say, guidelines.  We have a ballpark<br/>
time we shoot for at bed, because it works -- but it&#39;s more of the<br/>
&quot;get to a good stopping spot&quot; time, not a &quot;Stop that activity NOW,<br/>
because it&#39;s time&quot; sort of thing.<br/>
<br/>
I find it interesting that so many of the kids we&#39;ve known as my son<br/>
has grown up (and when he was little homeschooling hadn&#39;t even hit my<br/>
radar!) -- it looked like we were stricter, but yet, our son had far<br/>
more freedom!  And now, at 16, I hear other parents locally talking<br/>
about how their kid can only do, same, computer games on the weekend,<br/>
so he didn&#39;t want to go to a party because it took from his gaming<br/>
time.  That would be a red flag to me!  My son has fairly unrestricted<br/>
computer use, though he does need to get his schooly stuff done (he<br/>
takes classes at a couple different schools) -- but I don&#39;t tell him<br/>
to, or when.  <br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have any written or spoken rules, though -- but a general<br/>
philosophy of help one another, eat regularly (he and I have reactive<br/>
hypoglycemia, so going too long without eating can have unhappy<br/>
results, including not realizing he needs to eat!)  <br/>
<br/>
I think there is an ongoing process for some of us, though -- we have<br/>
gotten more and more relaxed as time goes on.  Would that I could know<br/>
then, what I know now!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I suppose the question that would get asked at our house is &quot;If *you*<br/>
have to get up to go to work, why do *I* have to go to bed when I&#39;m not<br/>
sleepy?&quot; I am the one who gets up and out to work Mon-Fri (at my desk<br/>
before 8 am) and yes, I head toward sleep somewhere around 10 pm most<br/>
evenings, even weekends. DH and DS can choose to come to bed when I go<br/>
but they don&#39;t have to. Often, they&#39;ll come snuggle for a bit then DS<br/>
may go to his room to watch TV, read or play with something. DH may stay<br/>
up and watch TV (he turns the sound off and uses the captioning if I&#39;m<br/>
sleeping - the light itself doesn&#39;t bother me once I&#39;m asleep). There&#39;s<br/>
a principle of being respectful to others (not bouncing on the bed when<br/>
Mommy&#39;s trying to sleep) but no rules about what constitutes being<br/>
respectful, because that changes in how it looks over time and in<br/>
different circumstances.<br/>
