<div id="ygrps-yiv-1016060327">This boy is 13!! Surely he should be able to communicate better than this in writing? <br/>
<br/>
*********<br/>
The boy is 13 and has any interest at all in putting pen to paper? Wow! :)<br/>
Really. It takes as long as it takes. If he&#39;s reading, maybe even sharing your journal, feels free to ask how to spell a word, is encouraged when he shares the content of his writing, etc., he can build on this interest in writing. <br/>
And maybe, just maybe, on this wonderful adventure to see hippos and crocodiles, spelling was not his highest priority. :)<br/>
