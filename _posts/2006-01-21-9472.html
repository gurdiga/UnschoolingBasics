<div id="ygrps-yiv-379087212">So today is going to be candy day again.  So far I&#39;ve opend two pixie<br/>
stiks and one dulce de leche(hard candy, really tasty) that I actually<br/>
tried to talk Reid into giving me.  I offered him doughnuts for<br/>
breakfast, the same doughnuts that he asked for at the store, and he<br/>
wanted candy and boops (Fruit Loops.)<br/>
When our oldest was much younger, we never really considered our<br/>
limits as limits.  My wife and I are both cooks and have always<br/>
offered a variety of food.  We&#39;ve doled out &quot;treats&quot; when we thought<br/>
appropriate.  We never had any issues with him and eating.  He&#39;s<br/>
always liked a variety of food and been willing to try new stuff.<br/>
I&#39;d read about non-limiting on unschooling boards, mostly Joyce&#39;s and<br/>
Sandra Dodd&#39;s sites.  We never really considered it though thinking<br/>
that our limits on candy/sweets and tv were obviously right, and we<br/>
were at least well intentioned, as are most parents.<br/>
With some other personal changes I&#39;ve been working on, I&#39;ve been<br/>
saying yes to the tv and video games.  Then came &quot;I want some candy&quot;<br/>
from my youngest followed by that sweetest of little smiles.  My wife<br/>
has been a little unwilling to jump in as I have, though I&#39;ve pointed<br/>
her to the sites I&#39;ve been reading.  She works a lot and doesn&#39;t<br/>
always have the time on the computer she would like.  Neither of us<br/>
want a candy addict child, which seems the obvious outcome to allowing<br/>
candy when the child wants.<br/>
So, yesterday and now today, on the table sits as much candy as either<br/>
of them could want.  My older son has picked through and eaten some<br/>
candy.  My younger has almost binged on candy.  I actually threw away<br/>
as much candy as he ate yesterday.  He would open or ask for help<br/>
opening something, try it, then put it down.  Three different<br/>
lollipops, one piece of gum, a small Hershey bar, random pieces of<br/>
random hard candy.  And this doesn&#39;t even include the amount of pixie<br/>
stik I&#39;ve wiped off the table that never made it to his mouth.  If<br/>
nothing else, maybe I&#39;ll get some insight into his candy preferences.<br/>
And my oldest?  He&#39;s at some ungodly high level on Pokemon on his<br/>
Gameboy.  My only problem with the Gameboy is that he&#39;s so busy on it<br/>
that he doesn&#39;t want to play any Goldeneye with me on the Gamecube.<br/>
I do want what&#39;s best for the boys, and I see nothing but common sense<br/>
when I take the time to ponder/ruminate on a lot of the ideals behind<br/>
unschooling and the parenting ideas inherent to unschooling.<br/>
So I&#39;m trying not to see this as an experiment.  I&#39;m not planning on<br/>
going back to how things were.  But a lifetime of thinking(knowing)<br/>
you know best, all the voices of parents who have gone before, all<br/>
these things that make it difficult.  And I can&#39;t help but think, what<br/>
if he really does decide to put himself on an all candy diet?  I know<br/>
that won&#39;t happen.  He didn&#39;t eat just candy yesterday, and I know he<br/>
won&#39;t today, but it&#39;s still hard to . . .not sure what I&#39;m thinking<br/>
with this, just EGAD, I guess.<br/>
Oh, I just opened a huge gum ball for him.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-287458844">You sound like a parent in the midst of transition.  Given that you have controlled and you are relinquishing control, your thoughts seem normal.  If you just trust, your child will not appear to you to be a sugar addict.  Right now he is a child who is basking in freedom of choice.  After a while, he will be a child who knows he has the freedom to choose whatever he eats and candy will have not power.  Good work, Sam.<br/>

Peace<br/>

peppermint patties with one small bite each.  The sucker that he just<br/>
had to have then left laying somewhere.  He also ate some red beans<br/>
and rice, mostly the sausage and beans.  My concern is slowly<br/>
becoming, not the candy he is eating, but where will I find the next<br/>
candy he opened but decided against.</div>
