For me  it&#39;s the trying to figure out what to get the long list of people.  <br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
For Christmas (and all year long really) the best gift that our  family gives <br/>
itself is the gift of doing, being, giving, visiting exactly who,  what, <br/>
when, where we WANT.  I don&#39;t have a list of people to &quot;give&quot;  to.  I have a list <br/>
of wonderful, caring, important people in my life.   No NOT all family members <br/>
make it onto that list, I will probably still send  them a little note <br/>
letting them know I am thinking of them.  But my time is  valuable and giving of my <br/>
time is a special thing.  Making or buying gifts  for people I really care <br/>
about is a JOY, I love thinking about the person, what  they would truly enjoy, <br/>
what would bring a smile to their face etc.  I do  not feel the obligation of <br/>
Christmas that so many people feel.  It doesn&#39;t  bother me if someone questions <br/>
why I didn&#39;t give them a gift.  Probably  deep in their heart they already <br/>
know why.  I don&#39;t try to be &quot;fair&quot; by the  standard terminology.  To me fair <br/>
means giving people exactly what they  want/need.  And that INCLUDES myself.  <br/>
 <br/>
My boys, Jackson and myself get what we want all year  long.  No we are not <br/>
made of money, and we do a lot of saving and  budgeting, but wanting something <br/>
doesn&#39;t just happen at Christmas.  We also  get and give each other gifts at <br/>
Christmas, with that extra something...the  extra thought that goes into <br/>
picking out a gift.  I haven&#39;t really thought  about it but for us maybe the <br/>
difference is that at Christmas it is about  getting the gift the person never knew <br/>
they would enjoy so much, along with some  from the &quot;Christmas list&quot;.  Finding <br/>
that perfect something for someone so  very special.  I LOVE THE SEARCH.  I <br/>
love the thought. <br/>
 <br/>
Since letting go of the typical Christmas, we have  enjoyed Christmas so much <br/>
more, we also have a solstice celebration as  well.  It did take a lot to rid <br/>
myself of the feelings of guilt, the  &quot;should have&quot; done &quot;should have given&quot; <br/>
whoever etc.  But it has made a  tremendous change in the holiday season, for <br/>
the better, for us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-707442749">Pam, thank you for this post.  You said it really well.  I remember<br/>
being at a support group meeting years ago, and folks were sharing<br/>
about being stressed by &quot;having&quot; to buy stuff for their kids.  It hit<br/>
me then that I didn&#39;t feel that way (so much - I do like to give<br/>
Christmas gifts!), because I gave of myself all year.  I am there when<br/>
my sister needs me, and she knows that - so I don&#39;t have to spend a<br/>
certain amount at Christmas to &quot;prove&quot; I love her.<br/>
<br/>
Wildflower (love your name! it makes me happy to write it), have you<br/>
read &quot;Unplug the Christmas Machine&quot;? <br/>

It has been many years since I read that, but I remember getting a lot<br/>
out of it - and it looks like you can get it cheap, used!<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>
Caren<br/>

I just thought this whole post was so great!  When we see it IS all a<br/>
choice, that shifts the entire feeling of everything. Christmas is one<br/>
of our favorite times, but I don&#39;t feel the whole &quot;obligation&quot; thing<br/>
anymore. That was self-induced.<br/>
<br/>
We have a common preference with our extended family that the focus is<br/>
on the kids. I really, truly don&#39;t want a bunch of gifts (though I&#39;m<br/>
happy if I receive them too) because it makes me so happy to focus on<br/>
the children. <br/>
<br/>
The adults don&#39;t worry about buying for each other. We mostly just<br/>
send cards and photos. The people we make things for are people we<br/>
truly adore. We would send them these things with or without a holiday<br/>
as an excuse.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing I&#39;ve released is doing all our favorite traditions by<br/>
a certain date. I LOVE making the traditional gingerbread houses, but<br/>
if things are busy we just make them after Christmas. Heck, we&#39;ll make<br/>
them in July if we feel like it. We can do it whenever it feels like<br/>
fun!  We&#39;ve done a Christmas meal that was Mexican themed before,<br/>
simple and delicious. :)  We decide exactly what works for all of us<br/>
and let the rest go.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one of the healing aspects of unschooling for me...there are no<br/>
&quot;rules&quot; or &quot;right&quot; way to do anything. Holiday is what we choose and<br/>
we choose to make it fun and soul-nourishing. <br/>
