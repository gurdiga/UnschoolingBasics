<div id="ygrps-yiv-1135104349">&quot;Right now Tristan (9) is watching a Mythbusters&#39; marathon. :o)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We LOVE Mythbusters around here. So cool!<br/>
<br/>
Right now, my older boys have &quot;Stroker and Hoop&quot; from Adult Swim on,<br/>
while playing video games at the same time. Don&#39;t even ask about that,<br/>
cuz I have NO idea how they do it.:)<br/>
<br/>
Jalen just went in to say goodnight and decided he was going to watch<br/>
with them for a bit, prior to that he was on Neopets, then helping me<br/>
cut up ATC blanks for Monday.<br/>
<br/>
Sierra helped with the ATC&#39;s and is now waiting for me to read her<br/>
some bedtime stories.  TTFN.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1995150999">&quot;Andy does enjoy Family Guy, but avoids Adult Swim by choice.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I completely understand!! There are some of the raunchiest, strangest<br/>
shows on the planet on Adult Swim, and my boys have very warped senses<br/>
of humor, so they love it.:) I can only take so much, but they&#39;ve<br/>
helped me learn to lighten up. I was watching a segment of &quot;Boondocks&quot;<br/>
last night...where they use some very crude language and bizarre<br/>
storylines. <br/>
<br/>
I was cringing a few times!  Can&#39;t watch it with Sierra, she can&#39;t<br/>
stand crude/rude language or scenes. My boys are a different story.....<br/>

I guess this is a good example of how we deal with programming that might  <br/>
not be right for our child.<br/>
 <br/>
Nick was watching Adult Swim by himself one night.  I came in and  asked him <br/>
if he was enjoying those shows.  He shrugged.  I told him  that those shows <br/>
were mostly for adults and that he could watch them if he liked  but he might <br/>
prefer a DVD or PBS Kids (I really got the feeling he wasn&#39;t  enjoying them, <br/>
otherwise I would have left it).<br/>
 <br/>
A few weeks later I heard him tell his sister when ASwim came on &quot;these are  <br/>
grown up shows, let&#39;s watch something us kids like!&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
I feel like he was watching it not because he liked it but because it was  on <br/>
Cartoon Network and he felt like he was supposed to like it.  So  sometimes a <br/>
kid with freedom doesn&#39;t necessarily see the choice  available and he might <br/>
need some guidance in interpreting the world.<br/>
 <br/>
Last night I was up late watching &quot;Object of My Affection&quot; where Jennifer  <br/>
Anniston is in love with her gay roommate.  My daughter (5) couldn&#39;t  sleep and <br/>
started watching with me. There are some gentle love scenes between  two men <br/>
and I thought about these TV discussions.  I was glad that she was  exposed to <br/>
this sweet portrayal of non-typical couples in love, something she  probably <br/>
won&#39;t see in real life where we live.  I saw no need for  discussion right <br/>
then, it either went over her head or she saw nothing  unusual.  Oh, she loves Sex <br/>
and the City (we watch the broadcast versions),  I think because it has women <br/>
dressed up and fabulous.  She calls it the  &quot;baby show&quot; because she <br/>
especially likes the ones with Miranda&#39;s baby.   Once, I watched it on HBO and had to <br/>
do a quick distraction when they really  showed some sex scenes.....I forgot <br/>
which channel I was watching....oops!<br/>

  For those who love Sex in the City, WTBS on cable is now running &#39;cleaner&#39; versions of that show in syndication.  That might make for less need for distraction on your part.<br/>
