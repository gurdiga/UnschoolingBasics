 </span></blockquote>How do you know this, if the option has never been available in a real <br/>
situation, minus controls? Start slowly, if he asks for a cookie, say <br/>
Yes. When he asks for another, say Sure. Want some milk with that? <br/>
Don&#39;t just say &quot;you can eat whatever you want&quot; that can be disturbing, <br/>
confusing and will probably spin out in a way that would have you <br/>
saying &quot;see I told you he&#39;d go crazy eating nothing but sugar&quot; and <br/>
you&#39;d rein things back into your control again. Which wouldn&#39;t solve <br/>
anything, you&#39;d be back beyond square one. Kids by their nature do not <br/>
want to be in pain, do not want to have stomach aches, do not want to <br/>
feel yucky. Right now, you are setting the limits to what his body <br/>
gets. He doesn&#39;t know how 3 cookies feels because you haven&#39;t ever <br/>
gotten beyond 2. If he keeps hearing &#39;eating 3 cookies will make you <br/>
sick&#39; and one day he eats 3 cookies and feels fine, then what? <br/>
Everything else is in question. Rather, slowly remove the &#39;special&#39; <br/>
status of sugar until it is simply one of many options. I have a 7 yr <br/>
old DS who has never had food controls (so it&#39;s a slightly different <br/>
scenario). I made 4 dozen cookies last night. He at 4 over the course <br/>
of about 2 hours and stopped without my saying a word. They were just <br/>
sitting there at the table, freely available. Another example from my <br/>
DS: he discovered &quot;Swiss Cake Rolls&quot; a couple years ago. He just loved <br/>
them. So, I&#39;d buy a box each time I went grocery shopping and he&#39;d <br/>
finish them off in a few days. Then they were on sale one week - 5 <br/>
boxes $5. So I picked up 5 (actually, he was with me so I told him to <br/>
grab 5 boxes - he was grinning ear to ear as he stocked our cart with <br/>
them). The first box disappeared in a couple days as usual. The next <br/>
box a little slower until *I* was taking them in my lunch because he <br/>
was done with them, he was satisfied and knew he could have them if he <br/>
wanted them in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, definitely keep tasty nutritious stuff on handy and be proactive <br/>
about it - often sugary snack foods are a quick easy thing to grab <br/>
when hungry. So, rather than let it get to that, bring some cut up <br/>
fruit chunks, cheese, &#39;trail mix&#39;, whatever into his range while he&#39;s <br/>
playing or watching a movie or whatever. But &#39;healthy&#39; is a somewhat <br/>
ambiguous target &#39;healthy&#39; based on a vegan outlook or an omnivorous <br/>
one? for example - rather, maybe try for &#39;balance&#39; in all things, some <br/>
sweets among all the other choices. Make cookies at home rather than <br/>
buying them to have more say over the ingredients (like no <br/>
hydrogenateds or HFCS or dyes). And, of course, if there are allergies <br/>
or food sensitivities, obviously those need to be watched. BUT not <br/>
unilaterally. Provide information to your child &quot;let&#39;s get this juice <br/>
box because that one has ascorbozylifructiholamine and that often <br/>
gives you an upset stomach&quot; My DS, having been provided information, <br/>
conversationally, not as something to scare or rebuke him (&quot;NO you <br/>
can&#39;t have that it has additive MNOPQR in it&quot;) but rather &quot;I think <br/>
you&#39;ll feel more comfortable inside you if we get some protein before <br/>
you have more cake. How about I get a PBJ?&quot; By discussing, naturally, <br/>
not didactically, what various nutrients do, he has a very balanced <br/>
idea of what things help him feel good, have energy, etc and what <br/>
stuff he might want to go easy on sometimes - he&#39;s very particular <br/>
especially about sodium (DH is hypertensive)and potassium balances and <br/>
about cholesterol and fat levels in foods. We still buy ice cream and <br/>
tortilla chips and salsa and I make cookies on a pretty regular basis <br/>
and DS, of all of us, has the most balanced attitude of all because no <br/>
one food or type of food has been elevated or made forbidden.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, lots of rambling thoughts, hope something makes sense. I think I <br/>
should stop now - it&#39;s getting toward my bedtime<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-18377175">&quot;The goals of losing food controls&quot;<br/>
The goal of not controlling.  The goal of not judging choices - when another person has control over their own lives.  The goal of our being available to give information on nutrition and knowing that they will learn what works best for their own body and learn to trust their own voices and choices.  The goal of our trusting their experimentation and that the outcome exceeds expectations.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll tell you a story.  My dd had a full day of ice cream.  This was following an evening where she fell asleep before getting her icecream dessert as planned.  When she woke up in the morning and realized she missed her icecream she was angry.  I told her she could have ice cream for breakfast.  Her eyes lit up and she said, &quot;really?&quot; - &quot;Sure&quot; was my response.  &quot;For breakfast, lunch and dinner and in between, if you want.&quot;  It was one of those really great joyful unschooling days.  From morning till night.  Breakfast, lunch, dinner and in between. By the time she got to dinner she declared she wanted &quot;real food&quot; - her words not mine.  This was two years ago at age 5.  She has asked if she could do this again.  The answer is of course yes.  She hasn&#39;t done this again.  I think just knowing she can is enough.  <br/>
<br/>
My older dd did go through a period where she asked me to assist her in her food choices.  She asked me to say no or yes to her.  So i did, based on my own understandings of healthy eating.  Her need for me to guide her on this was short lived.  She doesn&#39;t struggle with food and along with some food that is not nutritious she chooses for herself a very healthy balanced day.<br/>

I am new to the unschooling way, so can you guys please give me an <br/>
overview of what the goals are of losing food controls?<br/>
 <br/>
-=-=--=<br/>
 <br/>
The &quot;goal&quot; of giving up food controls is a child who knows when he is hungry and what food he <br/>
needs right now to keep him healthy and running. The &quot;goal&quot; of giving up bedtime controls is a child who <br/>
knows when he is tired and sleeps because he needs rest and wakes when he is rested.<br/>
 <br/>
Many of us radical unschoolers have made this HUGE leap and have found that it DOES, in fact, work (in a <br/>
healthy child! Disclaimer: some people have problems regulating food and cannot wind down due to some <br/>
chemical or genetic imbalance or diosorder.)! <br/>
 <br/>
Many (most?) of us had our lives proscribed *for* us---school determined when we would eat, when we would<br/>
sleep, when we would wake. When we allow our children to learn to listen to their bodies, they learn how <br/>
to tell when they need protien or water or a nap. They learn to &quot;read&quot; their bodies.<br/>
 <br/>
Great goal.<br/>
-=-=-=- <br/>
 <br/>
My six year old would eat nothing but sugar if I allowed.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-=-<br/>
I&#39;ll bet you $20 this wouldn&#39;t happen---starting ....NOW!<br/>
 <br/>
-=-=-=<br/>
 <br/>
 Would only <br/>
buying healthy options be considered &quot;controlling?&quot; I guess I am just <br/>
not clear on this point. I don&#39;t want my kiddos to develop destructive <br/>
eating habits, so I am looking for all the info. possible. <br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
Yes. Because how will they learn to make those choices? They&#39;re already made FOR them.<br/>
 <br/>
Offer everything as equal. Make a &quot;monkey platter&quot; of sliced meat, cheese chunks, crackers, grapes, <br/>
carrots with ranch dip, apple slices, peanut butter on vanilla wafers, chips with guacamole, some <br/>
steamed edamame, and little unwrapped Hershey kisses. Big platter with all those things---equally available.<br/>
 <br/>
They will probably eat the kisses first. &lt;g&gt; But chances are they will eat everything else too.<br/>
 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-815594753">My daughter enjoys learning by watching videos. We&#39;re fortunate that we have a large library that has a good amount of various videos (entertainment, educational, etc.) but we&#39;ve pretty much seen most of what she is interested in and have waded through the rest.<br/>
   <br/>
  Does anyone have any good resources to share where we could get (on loan or otherwise) videos such as National Geographic, nonfiction, biographies? We can&#39;t afford to join a club to own these. <br/>
   <br/>

<br/>
For me the goal is about framing my children&#39;s lives so  that their decisions are not based on external controls. Whether it&#39;s about food or TV or sleep or later on sex or drugs, I want my kids to be comfortable making their own choices. I want them used to listening to their own body, mind,  inner voice and intuition. I want them to recognize me and their father as allies who are working in their best interests. I want them to learn to recognize when someone does not have their best interests at heart also.<br/>
<br/>
I have one child who is a teen and one who is almost there. All those horror stories about teen rebellion have just not happened in our house. Sure someone will get moody or balk at the occasional request, but more often than not they&#39;re really nice to be with. We don&#39;t have big fights in our home. I really *like* them both. They&#39;ve had practice at making their own *real* choices for years. They&#39;ve been able to choose what and when to eat, when and where to sleep, what to buy, what and how much to read or watch on TV, etc. As such they&#39;re ready to tackle the big issues now with some reasoning tools in their emotional toolbox. They also know they can honestly come talk to me without getting shutdown by what I think of the choices they&#39;re struggling with.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the goal. The open ended, trusting relationship we have now. I think that&#39;s a direct result of my NOT controlling them all these years.<br/>

She could do a Google search for the kind of videos that interest her. <br/>
She can read the little blurbs about the videos and if they sound<br/>
appealing, copy the info. - title, director, producer, whatever and take<br/>
her list to your librarian.  She can get them through interlibrary loan. <br/>
Also you can search the library database on-line and your daughter could<br/>
do a media search and request the videos herself.   <br/>
<br/>
Dylan has been watching every movie ever made based on (and some very<br/>
loosely based on...shamefully, loosely based on&lt;bwg&gt;)  Edgar Allen Poe<br/>
stories and poems and H.P. Lovecraft stories.  And every movie directed<br/>
by Dario Argento (expanding now to movies produced and co produced and<br/>
based on stories by) Dario Argento.   Scores of movies.   I had NO idea. <br/>
AND because Dario Argento also worked with Sergio Leone Dylan has also<br/>
discovered Spaghetti Westerns.   Who knows where that will lead?  Clint<br/>
Eastwood movies?  Charles Bronson?  Jason Robards?  Jack Elam?   Endless<br/>
possibilities!  &lt;G&gt;<br/>

Ooh! Conor is currently reading lots of H.P. Lovecraft. I forget how he learned about them. I think it was through a character named Cthulu in an anime or manga series.

I&#39;m new here, haven&#39;t introduced myself yet but will soon! (I&#39;m on the run <br/>
right now.)<br/>
<br/>
Here is the website to a lending library. Not sure where you are from, <br/>
unfortunately, it is only available to individuals in Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, <br/>
Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin. I thought I would throw it out there just the <br/>
same for those of you who are in these areas that might be interested. <br/>
It&#39;s free to join, free to order and free shipping too! They even send you <br/>
return packaging envelope, sometimes asking you to send the old one back for <br/>
recycling! Simple, easy and FREE. Warning, there are curriculums (eek)! with some <br/>
of the products but we just set those aside &lt;G&gt; and enjoy the film, software, <br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1740860939">Hey Cari!<br/>
<br/>
When I joined this list it is because I wanted to learn more about and receive support for my decision to help my children learn through unschooling.  However, once I arrived I found out that many people in this group have extended unschooling to all areas of their lives.  Of course we know that unschooling is all about allowing children learn in the way that is most comfortable to them with us as parents supporting them and connecting with them through their interests.  Unschooling is really all about trust.  So, why not trust the children in all areas of their lives to include what they eat?  I had hang ups about TV and junk food when I first joined.  What was told to me was to not control what your children eat and how much TV they watch.  I thought, WHAT!  All Khalfani, ds1, wants to eat is junk and all he wants to do is binge on TV.  It was right around Halloween that I met this great group of people so I started with Halloween candy we started because Khalfani was asking every few minutes if he could have some.  So,  I allowed Khalfani and Kamau to eat candy whenever they wanted.  I left the bag down and they came and went as they pleased. It was killing me but I figured that I had nothing to lose by trying out the suggestion of losing parental controls on TV and food.  Khalfani ate so much candy that day that he got sick.  I know it is because he has never had freedom to eat sugar however he wants.  As a matter of fact, I have always been anti sugar because I struggle to not eat so much of it.  <br/>
<br/>
From that day on though Khalfani has self-regulated.  I like the way I have heard others talk about sweets and junk, they place no value of it in comparison to other food.  As a result, it does not stand out to the child.  But by us controlling what they eat, it makes them hyperfocus on that particular food.  I also don&#39;t like controlling what children eat because I feel that it turns off their ability to self-regulate.  If they have to depend on us to decide what they eat for many years, then how can we expect them to know how to do so once we relinquish control back to them?  Since extending the unschooling philosophy to eating and TV, it is a nonissue.  Sometimes my children awaken and ask for ice cream.  I give it to them and don&#39;t think twice about it because in the same vein, they will also eventually ask for something that does not fall into the sugar or junk categories.  Some days they eat little junk and other days they eat a lot.  I no longer focus on it and they do self-regulate.  <br/>
<br/>
For people who are particularly health conscious, it can make you crazy initially.  I don&#39;t try to limit the amount of junk or sweets that we have in the house.  It is almost impossible to do with Craig here, who by the way, does a great job of self-regulating.  I am the one who has eating issues.  But, I find that when we have junk and don&#39;t limit the children, the junk food stays around way longer and is now being thrown away because it spoils.  I do offer all types of food throughout the day which satisfies the health nut in me but I always ask them what they want to eat, especially Khalfani, because he has the most sensitive palate in the house.  Kamau is way more open to eating other foods.<br/>
<br/>
I will say that it has taken time for me to see how it all balances out when we allow our children to follow their own inner knowing.  The other benefit that I find is that is allows me more time to enjoy my children rather than trying to regulate areas of their lives that they are fully capable of  handling now.  These children were programmed with an infinite amount of wisdom and the only way we can fully see this wisdom is to allow them to be.<br/>
<br/>
Much Love to you<br/>
Tyra<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
  I am new to the unschooling way, so can you guys please give me an <br/>
  overview of what the goals are of losing food controls?<br/>
  My six year old would eat nothing but sugar if I allowed. Would only <br/>
  buying healthy options be considered &quot;controlling?&quot; I guess I am just <br/>
  not clear on this point. I don&#39;t want my kiddos to develop destructive <br/>
  eating habits, so I am looking for all the info. possible. <br/>
  If this subject has already been adequately addressed somewhere else on <br/>
  this site, please direct me to the place!<br/>
  Thanks,<br/>
  Cari<br/>

My daughter enjoys learning by watching videos. We&#39;re fortunate that we have<br/>
a large library that has a good amount of various videos (entertainment,<br/>
educational, etc.) but we&#39;ve pretty much seen most of what she is interested<br/>
in and have waded through the rest.<br/>
   <br/>
  Does anyone have any good resources to share where we could get (on loan<br/>
or otherwise) videos such as National Geographic, nonfiction, biographies?<br/>
We can&#39;t afford to join a club to own these. <br/>
   <br/>
  Thanks<br/>
