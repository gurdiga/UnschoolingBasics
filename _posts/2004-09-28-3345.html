<div id="ygrps-yiv-1806904209">Okay,<br/>
<br/>
So this is a rather humorous problem, if it is a problem at all, but I was<br/>
interested in getting some input.  My 3.7 yo son, Nicky, is getting more<br/>
interested in using the toilet on a more regular basis.  He&#39;s peed and<br/>
pooped in it since before he was two, but never for very long in terms of<br/>
number of days in a row.  Recently, he&#39;s decided to have &quot;naked days&quot; more<br/>
and not use a diaper.  He doesn&#39;t have accidents, really, but he&#39;s taken to<br/>
doing something I&#39;d like to call &quot;creative peeing&quot;... the other day for<br/>
instance, I hadn&#39;t seen him use the toilet in a bit and I asked him if he<br/>
needed to go.  He said Very Proudly, &quot;It&#39;s okay, Mama.  I had to go so I<br/>
peed in the Bob The Builder Box (and so he had).  I pretended it was the<br/>
potty.&quot;  Hmmmmm.  Not wanting to burst his bubble at all, but also hoping we<br/>
weren&#39;t starting any kind of trend, I said &quot;Wow, really.  Interesting.  Do<br/>
you think next time you can get to the toilet with your pee?&quot;  And he<br/>
cheerfully replied &quot;Okay!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well yesterday (another naked day) he came into the living room and joyfully<br/>
declared &quot;Mama, I peed on a TOWEL!&quot; like that was the best thing, ever and<br/>
quite proud of his accomplishmemt he was too.  The towel was in fact right<br/>
in the bathroom, and then later he peed on another one.<br/>
<br/>
So my question is how would y&#39;all handle this?  I&#39;m trying to remain fairly<br/>
neutral and just ride it out but I&#39;m not sure if he&#39;s going to suddenly just<br/>
start peeing on lots of different things for fun.  I guess my dilemna is<br/>
that the unschooler in me is having a hard time not being really excited and<br/>
laughing at his creativity and excitement, while on the other hand, having<br/>
him start to experimentally pee all over the house doesn&#39;t seem like a lot<br/>
of fun for dh and me (although likely the dog will love it).<br/>
<br/>
DS has taken lately to falling asleep at night in the living room watching a<br/>
video, and last night was the first time he was naked when I made sure he<br/>
had his flashlight and got his video set up before heading to bed myself.<br/>
He said &quot;Mama, can you bring me a towel in case I have to pee?&quot;  LOL.  All<br/>
of a sudden I remembered the defunct port-a-potty we had disassembled ages<br/>
ago.  I reassembled it and put it in the room for him and he got really<br/>
excited - he could pee while watching his video!  I&#39;m hoping that might<br/>
replace the towel thing (although that&#39;s not related to the video watching<br/>
btw - the other times he did it he was not watching a video), but I&#39;m a bit<br/>
concerned that it&#39;ll just be one more new spot to pee until something more<br/>
exciting comes along, KWIM?<br/>
<br/>
And is this a boy thing?  DD never did this.<br/>

I was going to ask whether you had a dog or cat. This would be a good  &quot;out&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;d tell him that the dog might (and it&#39;s very possible!) get the idea that  <br/>
it was OK to potty everywhere too. Dogs will pee over others&#39; pee----and you  <br/>
don&#39;t want the dog to start peeing in the house! It would help out a lot  if <br/>
the son would aim for the toilet--or a tree! &lt;g&gt; That would  help keep the dog <br/>
housetrained.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1224689463">The pee posts are cracking me up. We have 3 boys, and I have lots of <br/>
pee stories (when Inspector Gadget came out my son would whip his <br/>
penis out anywhere and yell, &quot;Go go gadget HOSE&quot; and then pee).<br/>
Suggestion: put a bowl of cheerios on the back of the toilet. Tell <br/>
him to put one in the toilet and aim for the center as he pees <br/>
(target practise). It might just seem &quot;fun&quot; enough to lure him in <br/>
when he has to go...<br/>
Just an idea.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks, Sandy,<br/>
<br/>
I love your Inspector Gadget story.  I don&#39;t think the cheerio idea will<br/>
work since he pees sitting down if he&#39;s on the potty (dh does, so that&#39;s<br/>
probably why) - I could give him the idea to stand up, but that seems like<br/>
inviting more creative target practice if you know what I mean.  On the<br/>
other hand, I wonder if the fact he associates the potty with sitting down<br/>
means that he&#39;s more interested in peeing on other things so that he can do<br/>
the standing and &quot;aiming&quot; thing ... hmmmmm.  Just occured to me.  Maybe I<br/>
should tell him he can aim into the potty too and go ahead and get some<br/>
cheerios.<br/>
<br/>
I like Kelly&#39;s idea about talking about keeping the dog housetrained!  Well,<br/>
I&#39;ll keep both in mind in case he starts getting creative again.  Right now,<br/>
he&#39;s in love with the port-a-potty - only thing is, my daughter decided it<br/>
was more interesting than peeing in the toilet too so I&#39;m washing out that<br/>
cup a LOT.  But hey, it&#39;s better than ten loads of towels..LOL.<br/>
