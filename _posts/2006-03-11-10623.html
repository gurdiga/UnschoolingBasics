<div id="ygrps-yiv-1504106337">&lt;&lt;&quot;It&#39;s refreshing to hear that there&#39;s someone else out there  that<br/>
understands that unschooling doesn&#39;t mean your kid is a &#39;little  adult&#39;<br/>
with all the knowledge and abilities an adult has to be able to  find<br/>
the information they need to make informed  decisions.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are many assumptions I have read in the safety post the last few  days. <br/>
It&#39;s completely opposite from what I have experienced in uschooling  and <br/>
unschoolers over the years.<br/>
 <br/>
I realize there are fears coming into unschooling and this list is here to  <br/>
take a new look at those.<br/>
Thinking that only a few agree with a thought tells me it&#39;s possible that  <br/>
one would know that the thought is off the understanding of and reality of most  <br/>
on the list.<br/>
 <br/>
I know when I was new it helped to know who and what other unschoolers did  <br/>
in life so I&#39;ll offer my life as an added example. I don&#39;t think I did an Intro <br/>
 anyway...<br/>
 <br/>
We are unschoolers and we follow many things that were listed as  neglect. We <br/>
are a totally normal family with friends who unschool and  not.<br/>
We have four children, I own a business and run a state  unschooling list <br/>
with over 80 families and maintain two web sites.  <br/>
We own 4 dogs with champion lines and we sell pups 1-2 times a year.  My dh <br/>
is a technician, can build houses and has many normal hobbies like  hunting, <br/>
building,cars and dogs..<br/>
Our son 14.5 enjoys his friends of 6 years (mostly ps),computers, surfing  <br/>
(water), biking, cooking (makes chili for events we attend and family  <br/>
meal)shopping,travel and has plans to build his own house when he gets  older.<br/>
Our daughter 6 loves to draw, play, cook, help  mom,dolls, shopping,creating <br/>
any thing, writing and travel.<br/>
Our younger sons 4 (May 28th)and 2 (April)love cooking, outdoors,  snuggle <br/>
time, Thomas and creating.<br/>
All the kids help care/play with the puppies and dogs. They meet  our <br/>
customers and are why we are successful in everything we do.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve worked out side the home for a newspaper and have owned a successful  <br/>
high end toy store and.com. I choose to be home, it was a sacrifice income wise  <br/>
but worth it. We have found a happier/more peaceful life at home and our  <br/>
children are free to choose to be home or not, food, tv ,bed  times,friends , <br/>
computer time or whatever else they choose(which never  falls under free for all).<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve added links below.. The last one should have a couple photos of the  <br/>
kids.<br/>
