<div id="ygrps-yiv-132223463">&quot;So when people do start to question, and trust me they will, how do <br/>

   <br/>
  But someone will not look at me and just KNOW that I&#39;m unschooling either. It is different than nursing in public. I can&#39;t say what I will do unti lthat situation arises.<br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
  And it wasn&#39;t that I stopped nursing because someone didn&#39;t like it. I had been trying to wean her since 12 months and was having trouble with it and that gave me the motivation to do what I had tried to do 5 months beforehand.  If someone thought it was an issue I was brestfeeding my 3 month old (which I do now) I wouldn&#39;t even give them a second thought. When they had an issue with my 17 month old nursing, it made me think because what happens when she turns two years old and then three years old and still nurses? I am just not comfortable with that. Maybe pumping would be another alternative (which I didn&#39;t do) but I just don&#39;t feel its appropiate to nurse a child that old. (Yes, I know I should duck and run now.. but I have tried to weigh the pros and cons of breastfeeding after a certain point and the cons have outweighed the pros for me. I just wouldnt feel right doing it. But of course thats just me :)<br/>

You have a lot of societal messages in your head that have nothing to<br/>
do with human development or biological urges. The mother instinct<br/>
would probably have allowed you to continue nursing her just fine. The<br/>
societal brainwashing caused fears to arise and those fears were more<br/>
important than instinct.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is NOT for the faint of heart. If you have trouble<br/>
questioning societal norms or answering nosy people, you either grow a<br/>
backbone or this lifestyle probably won&#39;t work for you. <br/>
<br/>
You will get questioned ALL the time when your school aged child is<br/>
out and about with you (unless you plan to hide in your house all day,<br/>
and even then, someone WILL ask at some point). If you can&#39;t stretch<br/>
your mind to question WHY you feel certain ways, or truly ask HOW<br/>
unschooling works and be strong enough to not care what anyone<br/>
thinks....I really don&#39;t see how unschooling can work.<br/>
<br/>
Keeping a three year old home is one thing. Having a 7, 10 or 15 year<br/>
old will raise a whole different set of issues that people will<br/>
approach you with.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-478404699">I breastfeed my daughter until she decided when she was ready to stop at  age <br/>
3yrs. She also decided to give up her binky a few months earlier and she  <br/>
began to go potty on her own a few weeks later. My much older children thought  <br/>
it was terrible that I didnt pressure her to do all of these things earlier, <br/>
but  I&#39;m much older now and something inside me just told me to relax and trust <br/>
and  so far it has worked. My daughter is 7yrs. old now and I am just <br/>
beginnging to  understand about unschooling. She is by far my happiest child and I <br/>
cant help  but feel it is because I am much more relax now. Qudos to those of you <br/>
who are  so wise, being young and first time mothers!  Staci, Mother of three <br/>
grown  daughters and a five year old grandson.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1035095730">I have absolutely no problems explainging why I unschool.<br/>
<br/>
And to be totally honest, its not about norms or society. If I was <br/>
stuck at home all day long and did everything in private, I still <br/>
would feel uncomfortable breastfeeding a three year old.<br/>
<br/>
That is just the way I feel. In my eyes, babies should be breastfed. <br/>
My three year old is far from being a baby. Thats just my personal <br/>
opinion of course.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone is wrong for doing what they feel is best for <br/>
their child. I just don&#39;t feel that for *ME* it would be apropriate. <br/>
It doesn&#39;t feel right to me. Thats all.<br/>
