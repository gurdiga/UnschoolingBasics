<div id="ygrps-yiv-767652909">Ive been looking at that very same question.  I am considering Nintendo Power, National Geographic, and Mad at this point.. He likes that Mad t.v show but I dont know if the magazine is similiar or for targeted toward a little bit older individuals.  I was also thinking about getting a subscription to a comic book or two.  DC comics have them.<br/>
My son is 9.<br/>
