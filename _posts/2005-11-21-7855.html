<br/>
Oh, I couldn&#39;t agree more!!<br/>

Brandie was over today with her kids and we were all stuck on makeup <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1818678259">&quot;Hey when you finish the book or whatever it is&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s probably going to stay a &quot;whatever it is&quot; for a long time. IF <br/>
there is a book, that will be more than a year away. Big if. <br/>
<br/>
In the mean time, I&#39;ll just take credit for Rue&#39;s. It seems to happen <br/>
