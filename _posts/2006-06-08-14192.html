<div id="ygrps-yiv-445986430">&quot;One reason I began homeschooling my kids in the first place was<br/>
because studies indicated that HSers&#39; test scores were higher than PS<br/>
kids&#39;. To some, this is important.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s NOT the goal of unschooling though.<br/>
If you place high value on test scores, academic ability at certain<br/>
ages etc...then unschooling really has totally different goals and it<br/>
may disappoint.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling says that test scores are irrelevant unless the learner<br/>
WANTS them for some reason (entering college is one example).<br/>
Unschooling says that learning is the ultimate, NOT comparing oneself<br/>
to other learners, or achieving a certain kind of learning!!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re the anti-test.  We&#39;re saying it doesn&#39;t matter one bit, nor does<br/>
it lead to greater success.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2125787909">&quot;Do some unschoolers choose to do a very small amount of forced learning?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How could you CHOOSE forced learning?<br/>
I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re not asking if an UNSCHOOLER would choose forced<br/>
learning (which makes zero sense), but rather do parents of unschooler<br/>
choose to force some lessons? Not if they&#39;re really unschooling!!<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about choice.<br/>
Unschooling is about freedom to learn what you want, when you want the<br/>
information.<br/>
Unschooling is about TRUSTING that children learn all the time, from<br/>
everything in the world and don&#39;t need coercion in order to learn.<br/>
<br/>
Coercion is detrimental to unschooling.<br/>
Trust and joy can not unfold as beautifully in a home where there<br/>
isn&#39;t a very strong bond of trust between parent and child.<br/>
How can your child learn to trust themselves if you&#39;re sending<br/>
messages that they can&#39;t be trusted? How can they see the learning in<br/>
ALL that they love, if you&#39;re sending a message that they need to be<br/>
taught?<br/>
<br/>
Some unschoolers choose academic types of learning and schoolish<br/>
looking activities at some point, sure. But that IS NOT the goal. If<br/>
that&#39;s the goal, unschooling is a really bad idea.<br/>
<br/>
I loved chatting with the Carey&#39;s up in Peabody (the other family in<br/>
the People mag. article) whose daughter is in Harvard now. They talk<br/>
about their unschooling experiences and academics/college were<br/>
certainly NOT their goal. They didn&#39;t care if she chose to bag<br/>
groceries or become a lawyer...they really just totally supported<br/>
her!! She&#39;s thriving on academics, but they&#39;d be just as happy if she<br/>
wasn&#39;t! That&#39;s the key. Letting your child BE who they are, exactly as<br/>
they are today. It&#39;s getting excited about the things they love,<br/>
because it shows you about WHO-THEY-ARE. How cool is that?<br/>
<br/>
If your goals is higher test scores, better academic achievments and<br/>
having a college bound child, then get off the ship now. Truly.<br/>
<br/>
If your goal is a child that knows themselves and is comfortable in<br/>
their own skin, that trusts their unique abilities, that feels whole<br/>
and capable and trusted,that knows they can learn anything and anytime<br/>
in life, then keep on plugging away...unschooling is for you.<br/>

I personally doubt that&#39;s going to happen. The KEY part of unschooling is (after trusting that they WILL learn, they can&#39;t help it) is learning to see learning in all its other forms rather than academics. There is far more to the world and life than just the 7 (or 5, or 4, or however many) core subjects.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I don&#39;t see how any of this will prepare him for a career or college <br/>

****Just to clarify, how old is your son? Is this the 12 year old?<br/>
He will be prepared because he will love to find out new things, discover different connections and be willing and very capable of taking on any sort of learning opportunity WHEN HE NEEDS TO. Right now he doesn&#39;t NEED to either get a job or go to college.<br/>
Stop worrying about the far away. Start living the NOW.  <br/>
<br/>
Chill out, keep your fears to yourself rather than sharing them with your kids.<br/>
Let it be summer vacation at LEAST until October, and in the meantime: <br/>
read this list, read Sandra Dodd&#39;s pages, read Joyce&#39;s pages, read Ren&#39;s blog, subscribe to Life Learning Magazine. <br/>
Let your son be, just for a little while, exactly Who He Is, not who he is going to be If it&#39;s up to you. Love him, play with him, tell him jokes, rub his back, watch Family guy with him, Save up some of those neat factoids you come across during the day and share them just like he is sharing his learning with you. Look for it, it&#39;s right there, smack dab in front of your face.<br/>
Open your eyes and truly SEE.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He&#39;s getting a lot of reaction from you by telling you this stuff. At his age, that might be just what he&#39;s after. Does he seem like a particularly angry kid? Are you concerned? My son Conor reads a lot of the same stuff. He&#39;s fascinated by it. He&#39;s also a pacifist who believes that violence belongs only in videogames.<br/>
<br/>
I mentioned to Conor (17) that your son liked the Anarchist Cookbook. Conor has read it online and then read A LOT about it on many different sites. He said to tell your son that a lot of what is in there isn&#39;t true. There are many sites refuting the &quot;facts&quot; in that book. It&#39;s good to point out to kids that no one source is the final authority on facts. What Conor got from reading all those sites (among other things) was a reason to keep researching a topic. It was the start on a path to all sorts of different bits of information about government, anarchy, laws, chemicals, physics, and on and on. Plus he has the smarts to keep questioning. I would nurture *that* in your son rather than worrying about school subjects.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a good page to start with: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Anarchist_Cookbook">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Anarchist_Cookbook</a><br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not that he&#39;ll necessarily learn something from the shows, but  in order to get the jokes he&#39;s going to have to be culturally literate. We&#39;ve had many an interesting discussion take off because of something in shows like that. You&#39;ve got to understand a lot about the world in order to get satire.<br/>

&gt; in all its other forms rather than academics. There is far more to the world and <br/>
&gt; life than just the 7 (or 5, or 4, or however many) core subjects.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;I don&#39;t see how any of this will prepare him for a career or college <br/>
&gt; someday. <br/>
&gt; ****Just to clarify, how old is your son? Is this the 12 year old?<br/>
&gt; He will be prepared because he will love to find out new things, discover <br/>
&gt; different connections and be willing and very capable of taking on any sort of <br/>
&gt; learning opportunity WHEN HE NEEDS TO. Right now he doesn&#39;t NEED to either get a <br/>
&gt; job or go to college.<br/>
&gt; Stop worrying about the far away. Start living the NOW.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Chill out, keep your fears to yourself rather than sharing them with your kids.<br/>
&gt; Let it be summer vacation at LEAST until October, and in the meantime: <br/>
&gt; read this list, read Sandra Dodd&#39;s pages, read Joyce&#39;s pages, read Ren&#39;s blog, <br/>
&gt; subscribe to Life Learning Magazine. <br/>
&gt; Let your son be, just for a little while, exactly Who He Is, not who he is going <br/>
&gt; to be If it&#39;s up to you. Love him, play with him, tell him jokes, rub his back, <br/>
&gt; watch Family guy with him, Save up some of those neat factoids you come across <br/>
&gt; during the day and share them just like he is sharing his learning with you. <br/>
&gt; Look for it, it&#39;s right there, smack dab in front of your face.<br/>
&gt; Open your eyes and truly SEE.<br/>

And then maybe we&#39;ll have you write something about them or give us an oral report? That would suck right? That&#39;s what cyber schooling and school at home is feeling like for your son.<br/>

I really wish you&#39;d quit saying that, after you just listed several<br/>
things he&#39;s LEARNING! It&#39;s so disrespectful to him. He doesn&#39;t want to<br/>
do anything YOU value as learning...he&#39;s learning constantly. You&#39;re<br/>
just eroding the relationship, by not valuing what he&#39;s learning.<br/>

Stop pulling teeth and start nourishing him as a whole person. He&#39;s<br/>

doing in school.  It *is* good reading and many of us think it&#39;s <br/>
good for you and that you could learn a lot from it.  This kind of <br/>
thinking is exactly what you and your son are going through right <br/>
now.  YOU think he needs to do something or learn something and he <br/>
is rebelling.<br/>
<br/>
Now don&#39;t get me wrong.  I too have a difficult time going through <br/>
certain books because of the way they are written.  I have two great <br/>
recommendations for you that I believe are very easy reads.  Chances <br/>
are you&#39;ll need to purchase them because they aren&#39;t the kinds of <br/>
books you might find at a library.  However, think of it as an <br/>
investment.  If after reading them, you still don&#39;t &quot;get&quot; <br/>
unschooling, then perhaps unschooling isn&#39;t for you.<br/>

they aren&#39;t going to look schoolish at all.  And how do you know he is<br/>

are. 99.9 % of us went through public school and bought into the line  <br/>
that you need to stay in school or be a failure.<br/>
<br/>
To get unschooling, you need to let go of that notion. It&#39;s *hard*!  <br/>
No one&#39;s saying it isn&#39;t. That notion that learning needs to look  <br/>
like school has roots entwined around so many ideas we&#39;re certain are  <br/>
true. It takes work to untangle them. It takes years to get rid of  <br/>
lots of them.<br/>
<br/>
The thing is that your son doesn&#39;t have years to wait until you fully  <br/>
understand and grasp and trust unschooling. You need to start doing  <br/>
unschooling now. You need to start trusting him now. Figure it out as  <br/>
you&#39;re doing it. You don&#39;t get special dispensation because you&#39;re  <br/>
&quot;used to learning being a certain thing&quot;! We&#39;ve all been there, stuck  <br/>
with that exact idea. We&#39;ve all had to work around and past the  <br/>
discomfort because our kids -- who are with us for such a short time  <br/>
-- are more important than our own comfort.<br/>
<br/>
You just have to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Someone described it as jumping off a cliff and then realizing they  <br/>
could fly just like everyone said they could. It&#39;s not the flying  <br/>
that&#39;s hard. It&#39;s the jumping off that&#39;s hard!<br/>

<br/>
  Depends on what you&#39;re looking to learn! &lt;g&gt; I bet there&#39;s very little <br/>
Chinese history on Family Guy. The discovery Channel had a bunch of <br/>
stuff on China a month or so ago.<br/>
<br/>
  What South Parka and Family Guy and the Simpsons and Ed, Edd, and Eddy <br/>
*do* have is oneafteranother clever lines---and if you&#39;re not fully <br/>
there (or don&#39;t have TiVo &lt;g&gt;), you might miss it. They &quot;cover&quot; history <br/>
and social studies and music and art and culture and.....---all wrapped <br/>
up in humor.<br/>
<br/>

 Family Guy did have an<br/>

 though. And South Park does talk about current events alot.<br/>

<br/>
 You&#39;re getting there! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  They make you think. Every time. The can also make you groan---out <br/>
loud! &lt;g&gt; But the thinking part is great. They help you make <br/>
connections. And that&#39;s what learning is about---connecting one thing <br/>
to another and building your own little universe of connections.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m just used to learning being a certain thing.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 It *never* was a certain thing. Learning is learning.<br/>
<br/>
  In school, it&#39;s supposed to look like curricula and workbooks and <br/>
tests and fill-in-the-blanks and essays. In school, it looks like math <br/>
OR science OR history OR art OR social studies OR grammar OR spelling <br/>
OR music. In school. But that&#39;s not what the kids are *really* <br/>
learning. Many of them are learning that it&#39;s stupid/boring/hard to <br/>
learn.<br/>
<br/>
  But in the real world, it looks a lot different. It looks like <br/>
butterflies and South Park and drums and lasagne and shoes and cats and <br/>
nesting dolls and cookbooks and cranium and jelly beans and horses and <br/>
swimming and hummingbirds and M*A*S*H and country music and Yu-Gi-Oh! <br/>
and bicycles and okra &lt;g&gt; and balls and long chats over tea and peonies <br/>
and guitars and clocks and IMs and trucks and bunnies and Zoombini&#39;s <br/>
and escalators and ATCs and sushi and Manga and, and, and..... (just a <br/>
little of our weekend &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
 Learning happens all the time. It&#39;s all how *you* choose to see it.<br/>

documentary if he has an interest in the documentary&#39;s subject and it<br/>
is presented in a format that is appealing to him.  I can&#39;t stand most<br/>
of the History Channel documentaries because they break for<br/>
commercials way too often, they essentially repeat the last 5 minutes<br/>
of the show after each commercial break and whoever does their<br/>
narration is so boring to listen to!  It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t have an<br/>
interest in the subject, but in the format.  And I&#39;ve watched a<br/>
gazillion documentaries on military aircraft and war machines as I&#39;ve<br/>
been in the living room when Dan and Keon are watching them and even<br/>
though it might have been &quot;instructional&quot; I still can&#39;t tell a Sherman<br/>
from any other kind of tank.  I haven&#39;t learned anything from them<br/>
even though I&#39;ve been in the same room while they were being shown<br/>
(and the reason I didn&#39;t get up is because I was happily knitting and<br/>
comfy and I enjoy watching my &quot;boys&quot; get excited about big &quot;toys.&quot;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It sounds like you&#39;re used to learning being something that&#39;s passive. Someone has some facts or information and they share it with you in whatever way, through a class, a documenary, a book, a kit, etc. That&#39;s what schools do. <br/>
<br/>
What we&#39;re talking about is a much more active learning experience. And in my opinion it&#39;s the more authentic learning experience. We&#39;re talking about being aware of the world around you and connecting the dots from one piece of information to the next. That&#39;s how you create a web of knowledge and understanding that is at the core of a truly educated individual.<br/>

&gt; &gt; There is nothing wrong with his choice in tv. As a<br/>
&gt; &gt; family we watch South Park. My four year old, thinks<br/>
&gt; &gt; Cartman is funny. I love Cartman. My cousin was<br/>
&gt; &gt; appalled that my ds watches The Simpson&#39;s. Then I<br/>
&gt; &gt; explained to her that in Christain Colleges they study<br/>
&gt; &gt; the Simpson&#39;s so what&#39;s the big deal? I also handed<br/>
&gt; &gt; her The Gospel acording to the Simpson&#39;s. Good book.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve learned so much here and the best thing has been<br/>
&gt; &gt; to let my child lead the way. And sometimes that means<br/>
&gt; &gt; letting him do things our society says is wrong. I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt; amazed at what my son grasps. <br/>

 It&#39;s everything. And everywhere. And all the time. It&#39;s unavoidable.<br/>
<br/>
 If you want to prove it to yourself~I&#39;m not kidding or being<br/>
 facetious~declare it to be a &quot;No Learning Day.&quot; Spend that day<br/>
 deliberately trying to avoid learning. I&#39;m pretty sure it can&#39;t be<br/>
 done, but maybe you can prove me wrong! Then, I&#39;ll have learned<br/>
 something new! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=---=-<br/>
<br/>
 I tried it.<br/>
<br/>
  Not on purpose, but because I was doing the same thing I did every <br/>
Wednesday.<br/>
<br/>
  I was grooming these poodles. I worked for a very wealthy family who <br/>
had four standard poodles, a mini, two toys and a shih tzu. I went to <br/>
their house every week and groomed them in the &quot;doggy salon&quot;---and it <br/>
was just the same ol&#39; same ol&#39;. I literally said to myself, &quot;I bet I <br/>
won&#39;t learn anything new today.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  Things went as they normally do: I was listening to the radio and <br/>
never-endingly bathing/clipping/scissoring poodles.<br/>
<br/>
  NPR had a bit about a conductor who was retiring. We was well-known, <br/>
well-respected, and well-liked. At his last concert, the orchestra <br/>
remained seated when he exited the stage. Fred Child told us that was <br/>
the highest honor and orchestra could pay a conductor.<br/>
<br/>
  I thought that was sooo cool. How wonderful that feeling must&#39;ve <br/>
been---&#39;cause Fred said that doesn&#39;t happen much at all (unlike <br/>
standingg ovations and encores which happen as a matter of course every <br/>
day now!). I didn&#39;t know that! &lt;g&gt; And on a day I didn&#39;t expect to <br/>
learn anything new! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Shari,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m fairly new to this list as well and I don&#39;t see these posts as <br/>
harsh at all.  I&#39;ve looked into and tried out unschooling a couple <br/>
of times in the past 4+ years of homeschooling but it&#39;s only been in <br/>
the last 5 months that I really, really get it.  People really new <br/>
to this concept really want unschooling to be easy or to just fit in <br/>
certain areas of their lives such as academic work.  But I have <br/>
learned that it&#39;s really about lifestyle changes and viewing my <br/>
children in a totally different light.<br/>
<br/>
I know you said you saw harsh posts in other subjects, but this <br/>
particular thread is being continued by one person who doesn&#39;t seem <br/>
to spend much time answering the responses she&#39;s getting.  Instead, <br/>
she&#39;s asking lots of questions that seem to be running along the <br/>
same vein.  I know I&#39;ve responded to her and never got any <br/>
acknowledgement at all.  I have no idea if she read my note and what <br/>
her thoughts may be.  You&#39;re right, we did give her reading <br/>
suggestions when what she might want to do is talk this all <br/>
through.  But she&#39;s not really carrying on a conversation.  It&#39;s <br/>
more like brief questions and minimal answers, no thought-provoking <br/>
discussion at all.  I truly get the impression, and I can certainly <br/>
be wrong, that she has NO desire to unschool but is looking into it <br/>
so she can tell her son that she read about it and disagrees with <br/>
it.  It&#39;s like she&#39;s condemning it before truly understanding it.<br/>
<br/>
I am learning that the best thing to do is really talk out your <br/>
concerns.  If someone yells with all caps, it&#39;s not because they are <br/>
trying to be harsh but they are trying to add inflection into their <br/>
post that is absent in this medium of communications.  Also, <br/>
discussing something like unschooling just isn&#39;t going to happen in <br/>
one or two exchanges of emails.  We&#39;re talking a whole lifestyle <br/>
here that encompasses so very much.  But anyway, if you feel <br/>
something is particularly harsh and you don&#39;t understand the meaning <br/>
of the post, respond and ask, just like you did on this thread.  But <br/>
understand discussion should truly be between at least 2 people, a <br/>
give and take.  Not just asking the same questions over and over and <br/>
expecting different responses.  :)<br/>

<br/>
 Well, *you* got the point. Maybe Erin did too.<br/>
<br/>
 You CAN&#39;T teach someone who isn&#39;t ready to learn. BINGO!<br/>
<br/>
  Until she is ready to open her eyes and *see* that, she can&#39;t <br/>
unschool. All the preaching and proselytizing I&#39;m doing amounts to <br/>
SQUAT if she&#39;s not ready to learn.<br/>
<br/>
  I cannot *make* anyone read anything, but if someone&#39;s coming to this <br/>
list to learn, I have to assume she&#39;s ready and willing. I assume she&#39;s <br/>
going to do the work to get there. I assume she&#39;s going to take the <br/>
suggestions and make changes and move forward.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  But rather than attack my post, do *you* have some advice for Erin on <br/>
how to unschool?<br/>

because.....&quot;  We aren&#39;t trying to create these roadblocks, but to<br/>
show her how she can take these roadblocks down.  Sending her links to<br/>
books and online articles is an easy way to utilize information that<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-284929515">That&#39;s my point exactly, though -- for instance, I was told it&#39;s all in<br/>
perception.  *Your* perception is that I attacked your post.  Exactly like<br/>
*my* perception was that you attacked someone else. <br/>
<br/>
I did offer advice, you just had to read through the lines.  My advice would<br/>
be, &quot;try to read through the unnecessary harshness & sarcasm of the answers<br/>
that you receive and you might actually be able to find the answers you&#39;re<br/>
seeking&quot;.  I was also trying to say, &quot;You&#39;re not alone in this, others have<br/>
questions as well but are really confused and becoming put off by the<br/>
answers of the experts on the board.&quot;  And finally, I wanted to get across,<br/>
&quot;You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I came to this list because, in the list description&#39;s words, it is &quot;a list<br/>
designed for those new to the philosophy of unschooling&quot;.   Perhaps those<br/>
who are old hat at the concept could try to think back to when they were new<br/>
to it themselves, all the doubts, fears, etc. that they felt, and remember<br/>
that it took you awhile to get to the point you are today.  Or maybe not --<br/>
but please remember that for some of us, it&#39;s not second nature just yet.<br/>
<br/>
And for the record, for the one who said that using ALL CAPS isn&#39;t shouting,<br/>
this is the first place I&#39;ve ever seen online where it&#39;s not considered<br/>
shouting.  Perhaps you could try using brackets, asterisks, etc., especially<br/>
since it&#39;s a list for newbies.  Intended or not, my perception is that the<br/>
posts with ALL CAPS really *do* come across as sarcasm/shouting.<br/>
<br/>
*shari*<br/>

<br/>
 Well, *you* got the point. Maybe Erin did too.<br/>
<br/>
 You CAN&#39;T teach someone who isn&#39;t ready to learn. BINGO!<br/>
<br/>
  Until she is ready to open her eyes and *see* that, she can&#39;t unschool.<br/>
All the preaching and proselytizing I&#39;m doing amounts to SQUAT if she&#39;s not<br/>
ready to learn.<br/>
<br/>
  I cannot *make* anyone read anything, but if someone&#39;s coming to this list<br/>
to learn, I have to assume she&#39;s ready and willing. I assume she&#39;s going to<br/>
do the work to get there. I assume she&#39;s going to take the suggestions and<br/>
make changes and move forward.<br/>
<br/>
But rather than attack my post, do *you* have some advice for Erin on how to<br/>
unschool?</div>
