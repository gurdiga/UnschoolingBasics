This year our Keynote Speaker is John Taylor Gatto. <br/>
<br/>
After being named New York City Teacher of the Year three times during his 30 year career, John Taylor Gatto accepted an award as New York State Teacher of the Year by resigning on the OP ED page of the Wall Street Journal in a letter titled, “I Quit – I Think,” stating he no longer wished to “hurt kids to make a living.” He began public speaking and writing. He’s authored several books criticizing institutionalized schooling, including the highly popular Dumbing Us Down; The Hidden Curriculum of Compulsory Schooling (1992), a must-read for home educators; The Underground History of American Education (2001), Gatto&#39;s opus; and his newest book, Weapons of Mass Instruction (2008), a shocking look at how and why the mechanisms of compulsory schooling cripple imagination and discourage critical thinking. One professor of education has called his books &quot;scathing&quot; and &quot;one-sided and hyperbolic, [but] not inaccurate.” <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
Gatto&#39;s office is in New York City, his home in Oxford, New York, where he is currently at work on a documentary film about the nature of modern schooling entitled The Fourth Purpose, with his friend and former student, Roland Legiardi-Laura. Gatto has been married for forty years to the same woman, and has two grown children and a cat. <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
* Please note – Gatto’s Keynote Address, as well as all other UWWG events, are open only to registered UWWG attendees. You must have a wristband to enter. <br/>
