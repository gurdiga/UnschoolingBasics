<div id="ygrps-yiv-828046831">Hi.  My name is Jeanne, and we used to unschool our ds who is 10. <br/>
Then the baby came and my post partum anxiety almost did me in.  We<br/>
sent our big guy to to public montessori that was flexible and<br/>
wonderful and didn&#39;t worry about testing or homework or anything like<br/>
that.  Then we got into the highly sought after arts school which was<br/>
a nightmare.  Now, we are trying to de-school, and work our way back<br/>
to homeschooling.  A few years ago, I was on an unschooling list where<br/>
the moderator was mean and rude and criticized anyone who didn&#39;t<br/>
follow the Unschooling law to the letter.  Strange, huh?  Every time<br/>
you voiced a concern, to help you and your family grow she would say,<br/>
&quot;that&#39;s not unschooling&quot; or &quot;I guess you aren&#39;t a true unschooler.&quot; <br/>
Needless to say, I got discouraged.  I&#39;m wanting support and this<br/>
forum looks like a place where I might find that.<br/>
<br/>
My first question. . .I&#39;ll start with a little one or two. . .how do<br/>
you all work with piano lessons?  And, how do you support an<br/>
unschooler who thrives on structure and falls apart with the lack of it.<br/>
<br/>
Can&#39;t wait to hear from you!<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;how do you all work with piano lessons? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perhaps you would like to be more specific about piano lessons.  Is <br/>
your son currently taking piano lessons?  Is there some difficulty he <br/>
is having with the lessons?  We would be able to comment better if we <br/>
understood the specific issue/or problem you or your son is having <br/>
over piano lessons.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;And, how do you support an<br/>

<br/>
I think that it is often thought that unschooling equals little or no <br/>
structure.  This is simply not true.  Our days are structured by the <br/>
natural rhythms of our daily routine and activities we enjoy.  <br/>
Instead of drawing attention to possessing or not possessing <br/>
structure, it might be helpful for you to ask yourself, &quot;What kind of <br/>
activities brings us satisfaction?&quot;  You and/or your son&#39;s <br/>
dissatisfaction with your days will guide you into a set of <br/>
activities that you fall into rhythm with.  A kind of structure will <br/>
naturally fall out from this rhythm.  Your attentive presence as your <br/>
son discovers his passions and rhythms will give him the support he <br/>
needs to reach out into this new territory.  <br/>

I thought Dana had a really good reply to this, but I wanted to add <br/>
to it. Y&#39;all are still deschooling. Part of that process is <br/>
emotional. There&#39;s a certain amount of security when someone else is <br/>
making all the decisions - I remember how scary it was to transition <br/>
to being self employed. I make the rules? Yikes. Your son needs to <br/>
feel that he *can* make decisions about his own life, but doesn&#39;t <br/>
always *have* to. Your biggest job in all this is to develop better <br/>
two-way communication with him so you can understand his needs and <br/>
wants and wishes and help him make decisions that honor those. You <br/>
may have to model some of that process for him. You think you want x <br/>
but you also like y... can we do/have both? can we try one and then <br/>
switch? etc etc.<br/>
<br/>
One of the startling things I discovered when my stepson moved into <br/>
our unschooling home was how uncertain and fragile he was - still is <br/>
in many ways. At 13, he&#39;s less used to making his own decisions than <br/>
my 5yo. It helped me alot, in the first couple months especially, to <br/>
let go of any expectations of what &quot;13&quot; should look like and meet <br/>
Ray where he was.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;how do<br/>
&gt; you all work with piano lessons?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>With any kind of lessons, its good to be ready to drop them at any <br/>
time. That may be emotionally challenging for *you* if you&#39;ve paid a <br/>
lot of money up front for them, so if your ds is waffling about <br/>
wanting to continue lessons you may want to look into a different <br/>
teacher or progam that lets you pay per lesson, or for only six at a <br/>
go instead of 12 or whatever. If he wants to stop, stop. If he wants <br/>
to take lessons but not practice, don&#39;t make him practice. If he <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to do the recital thing, be okay with that. Support him <br/>
where he is and look for solutions that respect his wants and wishes <br/>
*right now*. Be honest with yourself about your reasons for wanting <br/>
him to continue - do you have some picture in your mind of a future, <br/>
adult him playing piano beautifully? Own that image and separate it <br/>
from the real-life kid you live with. <br/>
