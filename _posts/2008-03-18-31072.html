<div id="ygrps-yiv-275265420">Hello friends!   <br/>
<br/>
I want to let you know about a wonderful new parenting/education book by Ginger Carlson <br/>
(http://www.gingercarlson.com) titled Child of Wonder: Nurturing Creative and Naturally <br/>
Curious Children. <br/>
<br/>
This book addresses multiple intelligences and learning styles while providing a ton of fun, <br/>
educational, and creative activities for your child to explore.  In this book, Ginger shares <br/>
her knowledge about education and parenting she has gained through her 18 years of <br/>
teaching elementary through college level classes and her 7 years as a home/unschooling <br/>
parent.<br/>
<br/>
From the website:<br/>
Designed to nurture children who think, wonder, and love to learn, this well-organized, <br/>
easy-to-read collection of inspiring ideas and techniques guides children&#39;s creative <br/>
development. A thoughtful, engaging resource - for parents and educators seeking to <br/>
understand creativity and to encourage it in practical ways - this guide illustrates multiple <br/>
intelligences and learning styles and provides tools to develop a creatively supported <br/>
environment that cultivates family participation. An array of complementary hands-on <br/>
activities explores topics such as imaginative play, math, movement, music, cooking, <br/>
science, storytelling, visual arts, questioning, cooperative games, media, and nature.<br/>
Ginger Carlson, M.A. Ed., has served as adjunct faculty at the University of Oregon and has <br/>
taught in public and private schools in the United States as well as in International and <br/>
Embassy schools abroad.  She leads workshops in creativity building for parents and <br/>
educators throughout the country.  She lives in Eugene, Oregon.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Creativity Building!<br/>
