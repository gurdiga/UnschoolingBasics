<div id="ygrps-yiv-1948446108">&quot;Something Orion has been doing for awhile is making her Barbies <br/>
embrace and kiss, just like the prince & princesses from her Disney <br/>
movies.  I have hoped this is normal, and have chosen to say little <br/>
about it.  It makes dh very uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
We rented an Arthur video with an episode about baseball, since <br/>
Orion <br/>
just started t-ball.  She must have watched (studied) that movie 20 <br/>
times.  I did not sit and watch the entire thing with her, but heard <br/>
enough to recognize some of DW&#39;s negative phrases coming out of <br/>
Orion&#39;s mouth the following week.  &quot;No one likes me,&quot;  &quot;No one <br/>
loves <br/>
me anymore,&quot; and &quot;That&#39;s not fair.&quot;  She was repeating so often <br/>
we <br/>
have had to address it, almost to no avail.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m reading this wondering where the problem is???:)<br/>
It all sounds so normal to me, really. I don&#39;t see why that would <br/>
make anyone <br/>
uncomfortable. I remember playing with barbie&#39;s just like that, only <br/>
much more <br/>
intimate. This is very normal for children.<br/>
They act out things they don&#39;t understand, try on behaviors just <br/>
like clothing. <br/>
It&#39;s all part of learning. It&#39;s HEALTHY....sounds like she&#39;s a <br/>
really bright <br/>
child that is absorbing and trying to make sense of the world around <br/>
her.<br/>
