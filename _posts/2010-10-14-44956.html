<div id="ygrps-yiv-1732010725">I did mine myself when I was 14...it lasted about 2 months before the skin died, <br/>
split, and the hoop fell out. There are a lot of dangers with doing it yourself, <br/>
especially with the danger of staph ( staph can occur naturally on your skin, so <br/>
staph is very VERY easy to be infected with). It&#39;s always best to trust a <br/>
professional, who has been trained. Mine scarred, and I was never able to get it <br/>
re-pierced because of thick scar tissue (I could have, but was warned that it <br/>
would probably hurt like hell, and that the piercing most likely would never <br/>
cover the scar)...so, at 35 years old I have a permanent scar that looks <br/>
something like a cigarette burn just above my belly button. :(<br/>
<br/>
Not to mention that more and more piercings (mostly self-done) are leading to <br/>
MRSA infections...which is something you don&#39;t want to mess with, ever. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I would look up some local tattoo shops and email them..tell them what&#39;s going <br/>
on and if they&#39;d be willing to let you bring your daughter (or meet <br/>
outside..whatever!) in to talk to the person who does their piercings. I&#39;m sure <br/>
they&#39;d be more than happy to tell her that self piercings are NOT cool, but in <br/>
fact just opposite. They know the horror stories and the medical issues people <br/>
have had to go through to be &quot;cool&quot;, including near-death situations. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For more reading, simply look up &quot;piercings MRSA&quot; on google. It will pop up a <br/>
few stories and/or blogs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1682260812">I read that this moment is passed and she has decided to hold off. I am<br/>
adding some thoughts anyway for later or for another reader...<br/>
<br/>
I would take her to a reputable piercing store and talk with the piercers<br/>
about getting the hole and it&#39;s healing process and how to avoid infection.<br/>
I would steer away from using fear tactic to get her to decide not to do it.<br/>
I have many piercings on various body parts. Some are healed through and<br/>
others still hold jewelry. I have never had an issue with any piercing<br/>
whether I did it myself or with a professional (many of my friends are pro<br/>
piercers/tattooists).<br/>
<br/>
There are also many kits available online that have videos and the piercing<br/>
equipment if someone should really want to do it themselves. I have pierced<br/>
myself and others with no problems.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, maybe this is just the semantics of how you wrote this, maybe I am<br/>
being picky so don&#39;t take anything personally...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;She also doesn&#39;t want to tell her father because he doesn&#39;t agree with<br/>
piercing anything other than ears.&quot;<br/>
What is it that he doesn&#39;t agree with because piercing various body parts is<br/>
a reality, people really do it, it happens. And it isn&#39;t a new thing, people<br/>
have been doing it for thousands of year. I think it would be respectful to<br/>
discuss it with him and listen to his concerns. Hear what they really are.<br/>
Because it is unlikely that he just doesn&#39;t agree with non-ear piercings. Is<br/>
he concerned with the healing/care/infections? or does he find that &quot;ugly&quot;,<br/>
unappealing, etc? Is he worried of what others might think? Does he<br/>
associate other piercings with a certain kind of person he finds<br/>
distasteful? These and other issues can be worked through. It seems<br/>
dishonest to hid it from a family member.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-916924893">Tagging on to what Faith wrote - some professionals will give you the option of being the one to do the actual piercing, so that&#39;s something to ask about. Its a good win-win - you get the benefit of someone who has all the tools and tricks and you can still have the satisfaction (and sense of control or empowerment) that comes from doing it yourself. <br/>
<br/>
Ray has had some piercings done professionally and some by himself with no issues. He has also had some amature tattoos done with no issues. His one staph infection has been from a shaving nick! <br/>
