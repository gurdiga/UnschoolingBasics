<div id="ygrps-yiv-1815938094"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I suspect that most of us have been there in the beginning. I know I have.<br/>
&gt; However, I think it is more accurate to say that we feel *defensive*, <br/>
&gt; since<br/>
&gt; &quot;attacked&quot; refers to what the other person is being perceived as doing<br/>
&gt; rather than one&#39;s own feelings. It is perfectly possible to feel defensive<br/>
&gt; even in the absence of attack.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know that in the beginning, I was very defensive. The first question I <br/>
posted, I can honestly tell you, I was NOT ready to hear the answer.  When I <br/>
first read the responses I got, I was like...... who do they think they are? <br/>
the unschooling queens? (I hope you don&#39;t take offense. LOL).  It took me a <br/>
few times of reading my posts again & the numerous replies I got, to say <br/>
WOW, they just might have something :)  So for all the new members ......... <br/>
your not alone & please don&#39;t leave just because you don&#39;t agree or <br/>
understand right away. You&#39;ll be missing alot<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Defensiveness can be great because it is a real clue that something needs<br/>
&gt; examining. I find I feel the most defensive when I am the most in the <br/>
&gt; wrong.<br/>
&gt; When I most want to jump back and bite is when I try to take a deep breath<br/>
&gt; or two, and walk around the house muttering replies to myself, until I get<br/>
&gt; to what *my* real problem is.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have discovered that when I am at my most defensive, I now realize I need <br/>
to step back and examine myself & the situation.  I&#39;ve even told my kids to <br/>
let me know  when I&#39;m slipping into an old habit ( which they gleefully <br/>
do ).   Some old habits die hard, but we&#39;re working on it.  And I&#39;ll have <br/>
many more times I will need the advice of the members of this list.  Some I <br/>
might not even agree with at first, but its amazing what a little <br/>
open-mindedness will do.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for a great start.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is true for me, as well.  As a matter of fact, I used to be <br/>
(when we first began homeschooling) first in line to bash <br/>
unschoolers.  Comments like:  how will those kids EVER learn math?  <br/>
pass the GED or score well on the SATs?  attain the discipline to <br/>
stick with the &quot;un-fun&quot; tasks of life? Won&#39;t they become selfish and <br/>
lazy always doing only what they&#39;re interested in?? The list goes <br/>
on.  (Please forgive my ignorance:-(<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I didn&#39;t actually KNOW any unschooling families, nor had I <br/>
bothered to learn anything about the lifestyle.....but because I was <br/>
unsure of myself (I was a curriculum junkie), I had to validate what <br/>
I was doing.  Somehow it seemed like it would be more acceptable to <br/>
my critics if I painted a picture of the kids and I sitting around <br/>
the kitchen table with our workbooks -- or me standing at a <br/>
chalkboard teaching them &quot;lessons.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Ugh.  Painful, but I guess taking responsibility for our <br/>
mistakes/ignorance and doing our best to correct them/it is part of <br/>
(like grandma used to say) growing older and wiser.  <br/>
