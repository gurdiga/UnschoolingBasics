<br/>
I know isn&#39;t this site AMAZING!!! I have it list in the resource section of<br/>
my book that is just about to be published at the very top of the list!:)<br/>
<br/>
I believe I am on the website linked up too!:)<br/>
http://www.lifelonglearning4all.com<br/>
<br/>
She may still have my old site on there as http://www<br/>
life-long-learning-4-all.com I just have not emailed her yet to ask here to<br/>
change it to the new one above because I have been so busy with the final<br/>
edits of my book prior to publication!!!:)<br/>
<br/>
I am so glad to know someone else who is also listed on her site!:) It has<br/>
such a plethora of info!:)<br/>

In Love and Light,<br/>

&quot;For no matter where knowledge and learning come from - no matter what shape<br/>
 size, or dimension it assumes - it still is what it is, knowledge and<br/>
learning. Therefore knowledge and learning should always be embraced.&quot; ~<br/>
