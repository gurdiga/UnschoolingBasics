<div id="ygrps-yiv-246473635">I watched it.  I took a nap beforehand, but woke up just in time to  catch <br/>
the segment. (LOL)  I thought it was great.  It was interesting  to see how much <br/>
they spent each month (around $2000 - I am sure this is on  the high side) <br/>
and very motivating for me to get out and see more of the  States.  Get Naked.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-384668636">I recorded it AND watched it.  The story was AWESOME!!  It&#39;s so <br/>
refreshing to see a news story shed a positive light on a family making <br/>
a change to better themselves, even though it goes against the grain of <br/>
&quot;conventional thinking.&quot;  It was also nice to see them show the other <br/>
families doing the same thing!  Loved how the kids were so sick of <br/>
everyone asking them &quot;what grade are you in?&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Yes! And I loved that while the news guy was interviewing them, the<br/>
kids were spontaneously reading and challenging themselves. He asked<br/>
Jen about it and she had to turn around to see what they were up to,<br/>
because it WAS spontaneous. So cool.<br/>
<br/>
I also thought it was great about the kids rolling their eyes and<br/>
saying &quot;Mom and Dad are humping again&quot; (surprised they went with that<br/>
for the segment because it was SO funny and so REAL) and calling their<br/>
RV the &quot;rolling turd&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
If you go to their website it&#39;s really fun to look around. They run<br/>
&quot;families rock&quot; and have been interviewed about that before...not<br/>
mentioned in this segment. Click on &quot;Trailer Trash&quot; for some great<br/>
artwork by their kids. I have one hanging on my wall.<br/>
<br/>
I wish they&#39;d shown a bit more about the other families they meet up<br/>
with. The one family that answered a question is the Freerange<br/>
Family...they visited us here a couple weeks ago on their way back to<br/>
TX. Really fun people.:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1530248760">We saw it and I fell in love with the family.  They all seem so happy and <br/>
silly and appear to be having so much fun together.  We can&#39;t wait to be FOTR!<br/>
<br/>
I liked the segment and truly understand what the parents were saying about <br/>
the American dream not really feeling right to them.  The American dream is <br/>
kind of like public school with most stuff being forced upon us and less stuff <br/>
being our choice.  I hadn&#39;t really thought of the American dream being such an <br/>
individual choice or series of choices but the bare naked family helped me see <br/>
the light!  They are realizing their dreams.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>  It was great to see that episode! Last year we left MS , left a $45,000 job ( which amazingly we were just barely getting the bills paid) a house full of furniture , etc and became &quot;homeless&quot; . We also left a community, school etc that was not right for my children. Too long to write it all out right now but just ugh a lot of corruption. <br/>
   <br/>
  We lived off savings for about 3 months and well since we didnt have much savings had to hury up and find something. We are living off $600 twice a month ....moneywise things are tighter than they have ever been before but its Wonderful!. ...I feel weird praising a school on an unschooling list but hey its part of our life right now.........<br/>
  Nates new school has done more for him in 8 weeks than the old school did in 2 years. In the old school Id come to pick him up and he would be just laying on the floor in a corner kicking the wall. ( and they wonder why he has absent over 50% of the time ) here they take him for rides in the wagon , rock him etc to give him frequent breaks that he needs, massage his feet, give him lots of sensory play...anything that they can do to help him feel comfortable in what is a very uncomfortable world. <br/>
  We left a community in MS that had a eww whats wrong with him atttitude and ended up in a community that embraces him as he is . <br/>
   <br/>
  Anyhow Im sorry my rambling is getting really long so Ill hurry up and end this thing. I used to think well if we just start having a bit more money and get ..X life will be so much better..........life is better now. Sure we have our trials ...Im worrying about how &quot;santa&quot; is going to make it here this year.......we no longer have high speed net , or a netflix subscription, or satelite, or ..........................but we have friends and trees and butterflies and a family that is happier than ever before. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1419067648">NO!  The girls and I stayed up to watch it.  We saw the beginning of <br/>
the show, then it went to commericial and then the station put <br/>
on &#39;Frasier&#39; instead.  <br/>
<br/>
Can you see it online?  The kids were very anxious to see other people <br/>
that &#39;unschooled&#39; so they could tape it to show their grandma that <br/>
they aren&#39;t weird.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2118638558">I thought it was great!  I loved the part when the interviewer mentioned the<br/>
kids were reading in the back and the mom had to turn around.  He seemed so<br/>
surprised to see them do that when all I can think is that happens all the<br/>
time here.  Anyway, I was wondering if they were at the conference because<br/>
when they were sitting at the table there I thought I saw an L & L water<br/>
bottle on the table.<br/>

Thanks for the tip to watch it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-799378616">It was great... I&#39;m so glad I got to see it.  My DD watched most of it with<br/>
me.  I think she liked seeing other kids who also unschool.  When the kids<br/>
were talking about the kinds of questions that they get asked... my DD said,<br/>
&quot;yeah, people ask me what grade I&#39;m in, too.&quot;  I just reminded her that when<br/>
you don&#39;t have a grade level it doesn&#39;t matter... that in real life there<br/>
are no grade levels. <br/>

Thanks for letting us know about the show... it was so nice to see other<br/>
people living free lives.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1458536502">My husband & I watched it, and found it very inspiring to say the least.  It&#39;s nice to see how <br/>
much unschooling families put their families first, which is how it should be IMO.  Also <br/>
just the whole &quot;live simply so that others may simply live&quot; ideology is something to strive <br/>
for, not  &quot;the person who dies with the most toys wins&quot;.  You could see how happy their <br/>
children were, and how connected they were as a family in just that short segment, they <br/>
must be doing something right:)<br/>

something &#39;weird&#39; but they showed it as a valid alternative <br/>
lifestyle and the kids were great. I particularly enjoyed the part <br/>
where the interviewer and the mom were sitting at the table chatting <br/>
and he glanced back and the kids were just hanging out *reading* <br/>
without being required to or anything. He admitted he was amazed at <br/>
that - and it was just sort of a non-chalant &quot;oh, yeah, they do that <br/>
when they feel like it&quot; run of the mill in our family kind of thing.<br/>
