<div id="ygrps-yiv-1815998697">Wow Karen,  thanks for sharing that, emotional problems are very hard to move and change I agree with you.  <br/>
<br/>
I am new to this, and my son does have a dairy allergy.  He comes out in very itchy eczema all over his body if he eats anything with milk in it for days afterwards.  I feel really sorry for him when this happens, he is only 5.  <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone think this will affect him adversley???  The other day he wanted a biscuit that had milk in it, he had it and he did pay for it.  I told him it had milk in it and he said he wished he hadnt eaten it, however he does make the choice if he comes across food that isnt dairy free.  I check all the labels of stuff and buy things that he can eat without milk, so I guess he is eating what he wants within a limit of no milk.  I get chocolate thats dairy free, & dairy free cheese so he doesnt feel like he&#39;s missing out, he loves marshmallows  and he loves potato chips, but also his fav are little rice crackers & hummus...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway would be interested in peoples take on the whole restricting food due to allergy thing, as Ive never thought about it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,  Camille<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    Agreed!!! And when I came to this list I had MAJOR issues with food control<br/>
  because I had always been controlled. You can do an archive search for my<br/>
  name and see. My story about my son and the &quot;monkey platter&quot; is even on<br/>
  Sandra&#39;s website.<br/>
<br/>
  Here&#39;s the thing, my boys have NOT always been unschooled. Their<br/>
  &quot;defooding&quot; was more terrifying to me than anything else...and it&#39;s because<br/>
  I love my kids. I know you love your kids OP, that&#39;s not in question. But<br/>
  in the end, my mother loved me too, and being ultra controlling about food<br/>
  ended up with me being fat anyway, and having (even now) serious body image<br/>
  issues. Bordering on BDD. THAT is far more harmful to me than any Doritos<br/>
  could ever be. Maybe you don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to look at yourself in<br/>
  the mirror and have actual HATE for what you see staring back at yourself.<br/>
  But I do. I fight it every day. That&#39;s what controlling food can do.<br/>
<br/>
  My boys are pre-teens now, so that means there isn&#39;t enough food in the free<br/>
  world to fill them up. So they graze. Sometimes on a gallon of ice cream.<br/>
  Most of the time it&#39;s on protein. That&#39;s what they need right now. This<br/>
  discussion was yesterday with my soon to be 13 yr old.<br/>
<br/>
  John: &quot;Um....when I eat a lot of ice cream I feel like shit.&quot;<br/>
  Me: &quot;Well, that&#39;s your body&#39;s way of telling you to knock it off.&quot;<br/>
  John: &quot;Yeah ice cream is bad.&quot;<br/>
  Me: &quot;Nah, ice cream isn&#39;t bad, it&#39;s great and it&#39;s enjoyable. But if you<br/>
  eat too much it&#39;s too much fat and sugar for your body at once. Just eat it<br/>
  in moderation.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  And we had that discussion while jogging TOGETHER. My almost 13 yr old<br/>
  wants to run with me. Doesn&#39;t feel ashamed to be with his mother and he<br/>
  listens to me when I talk because I stopped putting my foot on his neck.<br/>
  And I do want to encourage him to see all foods as good. ALL food has to be<br/>
  eaten in moderation even healthy ones. Did you know about *Orthorexia*, or<br/>
  *orthorexia nervosa* is a term coined by Steven Bratman, a Colorado MD, for<br/>
  an eating disorder characterized by excessive focus on eating healthy foods.<br/>
  In rare cases, this focus may turn into a fixation so extreme that it can<br/>
  lead to severe malnutrition or even death?<br/>
<br/>
  How about this? Ever seen this?<br/>

If you go to the main &quot;Messages&quot; page and type &quot;allergy&quot; in the &quot;Subject&quot; box, you&#39;ll come up with a bunch of posts on the topic. <br/>
<br/>
As far as the effects of continually getting eczema, if you haven&#39;t already, join the &quot;foodlab&quot; Yahoo Group and ask there. It&#39;s all about figuring out and dealing with food allergies/sensitivities and if anyone would know, it&#39;s them. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck! My daughter had allergic colitis (bloody poop! yay!) from  dairy as a baby so we&#39;ve avoided it thus far, using many of the strategies you seem to use. Peanuts seem to give her eczema.If she gets it again next time we get peanut butter crackers, I think I&#39;m going to take a photo, to help her remember how awful it was. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1008891252">Thankyou Alex,<br/>
<br/>
I will have a look at that.  I had never considered allergy as being holding back food, I guess it is but the results are too horrid to live with.  Allergic Colitis sounds terrible, thankgoodness you found what was causing that.  Its mostly if we are eating with friends etc that the food is not milk free however most of them know about it and so are very accommodating.<br/>
<br/>
Mason hates the itching and he scratches at night, and as Im right beside him I really know about it, the poor little sweetie.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for you post :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1125436478">Thanks Joyce & Karen,<br/>
<br/>
I too have allergies and sure sometimes Ill think okay Im just gonna have <br/>
pizza &#39;ll be worth it :)  Its the same with Mason.  We do get all the stuff <br/>
he can eat, soy icecream, cheese, milk, chocolate and stuff without milk, <br/>
you can usually find stuff if you look; however sometimes, happened the <br/>
other day we had biscuits that had milk, he ate one, was itchy but he liked <br/>
the biscuit.<br/>
<br/>
From what you say Im pretty sure Im doing all I can.  He not bad if he eats <br/>
anything its just his body reacts to it,  we usually choose things that dont <br/>
have milk in it as he doesnt like the reaction he gets.<br/>
<br/>
None of us has a badness attachment to dairy - just that it doesnt go well <br/>
with us. And yes I hope he grows out of it, my eldest did so it is good to <br/>
try from time to time when he wants to, just to see :)<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-551592835">Zoe (three next month) has a peanut allergy.Â Â  We do have peanut butter in the house and peanut M&M&#39;s are my husband&#39;s favorite snack.Â  Right now, we tell her that peanuts will make her sick and we are careful to keep items with peanuts out of her way.<br/>
<br/>
Her allergy is severe enough that I carry an epi-pen just in case, but not so severe that we avoid non-peanut products that were made on machines that process peanuts.Â  I honestly don&#39;t know how we&#39;ll handle it when she&#39;s older.Â  We just got health insurance again (after eight months without it) and I am considering having her testing again to see if her peanut allergy has changed - I read somewhere that peanut allergy can worsen with age - if hers is getting worse, I would like to know so we can make changes.<br/>
<br/>
Megan (just turned eight) is slightly lactose intolerant. We discovered it when she was around a year old.Â  It  seems to be disappearing as she gets older.Â  She&#39;s always had soy milk.Â  We tried alternatives ice creams and cheeses and she decided she didn&#39;t like them.<br/>
<br/>
Usually what will happen is she&#39;ll go through a period where she really wants cheese - so she&#39;ll have cheese & crackers, grilled cheeses, quesadillas, and just snacking on cheese - then she&#39;ll have some tummy trouble and we&#39;ll try to figure it out and realize she&#39;s been eating lots of cheese.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I&#39;ll notice she&#39;s eating lots of cheese and ask her how her stomach is feeling in a very neutral way.Â  She isn&#39;t a kid who likes feeling sick, so she self-regulates pretty well in general.<br/>
<br/>
We also live with daily asthma medications for both kids (and husband), so this kind of thing isn&#39;t a big deal in our house.Â  It is a part of our life, but not the focus of our life - if that makes sense.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2017184149">I have been following these threads and just wanted to &quot;weigh in&quot;.  My son has a severe allergy to red food coloring.  It is really horrible what happens.  I tried withholding the foods (he loves skittles) but realized he would have to make the decisions.  So I let him choose and we discussed what happens when he has red food coloring.  He tested it out for himself and gets to choose.  After a month or 2 of ups and downs he came to me and said he wanted to be able to eat skittles or m&m&#39;s but knew how it made him feel horrible, how he felt completely out of control.  He will still buy skittles and M&Ms however he shares or gives the ones with red away and keeps the others.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing he has done for the past year or so is eat almost exclusively &quot;white&quot; food.  Grits, milk, butter, cheerios, flour tortillas with cheese, cheese and crackers, mac and cheese. Sometimes he will eat PB&J sandwiches or tuna sub on wheat from Subway (the only kind he likes).  I don&#39;t say anything, just let him fix what sounds best.  He doesn&#39;t like tomatoes only ketchup....Do I worry about what he is eating?  yes....but I have noticed lately that because I don&#39;t say things, because I trust him, he has chosen to eat more fruits and veggies.  Because I give him respect and trust him to make his own food choices he doesn&#39;t feel the need to get candy that makes him feel bad--that he is allergic to.  <br/>
<br/>
There was a time when he was younger that all he wanted to eat was bananas, green beans and oatmeal....and everyday lunch for months was hot dogs or mac and cheese.  That was it.  That is who he is, how he is.  For now it is white foods....in the future it may be all green.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-784917054">Thanks Gwen,  its pretty much like that with us too.  Peanuts I believe are alot less likely to outgrow, however each child is individual so who knows, I hope your does.  Its just easier all round without allergies, but if you have them you deal with it and like you say the children seem to be pretty much self regulating - apart from the severe ones when you cant let them make that choice (anaphylaxis).<br/>

Thanks for the response :)<br/>

We discovered her allergy when she took a bite of my peanut butter covered waffle.Â  She started wheezing and coughing and her eyes got red and puffy.Â  She nursed for a bit and then she was fine.Â  The doctor suspected peanut allergy and sent us to an allergist.Â  They confirmed, but said it wasn&#39;t a severe reaction.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-859782419">Oh you poor thing.  I get terrible stomach aches from Avocado & bananas, but fortunately not the breathing.  I think its so terrible when you have breathing problems, and can well understand you keeping well away from these things too.  I totally agree breathing is preferable :)<br/>
<br/>
Hope your daughter grows out of it, it must have been terribly scary when it happened.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-351187707">That is so interesting.  I remember reading once, long long ago about how young ones will know what their body needs and will perhaps eat salt or butter or something that their body needs that we would think yuk...  So why not later on.  Perhaps it is a need in him to eat certain colour food for the vitamin/mineral content during growth and then move onto another colour - very interesting.  <br/>
<br/>
My son likes things that I find quite odd sometimes.  He will suddenly want beetroot and he can sit and eat and eat a heap of it just by itself - of course you can tell a day later as it shows in the toilet! Then he loves tomatoes - chutney, sauce,soup, anything and curry, anything spicy he loves; hummus; doesnt like meat much at all, but loves chilli beans on nachoes, but wont eat it if it has mince with them.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway thats probably enough about that, thanks for sharing :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1069296617">It seems to me food effects on the body and mind are like school math, <br/>
btw. <br/>
<br/>
Most physical and psychological food effects are not true &quot;allergies&quot; or <br/>
weight disorders, which unfortunately seems to set up the minority of <br/>
people with true food allergies and clinically serious weight problems, <br/>
to be suspected of overreacting, making excuses or even lying.  Math <br/>
disability/disorder is the same.  Most people don&#39;t have either one but <br/>
almost everyone has to work at some aspect of math and weight control, <br/>
so they believe true food or math processing disorder doesn&#39;t exist for <br/>
anyone.</div>
