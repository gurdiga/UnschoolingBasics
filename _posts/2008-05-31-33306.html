 </span></blockquote>It all gets spent on special ed - it just isn&#39;t enough for the level  <br/>
of services needed to provided &quot;adequately&quot; for each child.  My  <br/>
district has a school for deaf children from preschool through 6th  <br/>
grade. It is shares a site with another elementary school and all the  <br/>
kids have art, pe, music, computer lab and assemblies and some other  <br/>
stuff together. There are 38 children in the school and it has its own  <br/>
principal, 7 teachers with specialty masters degrees, a full-time  <br/>
speech therapist, an audiologist, and 6 full-time aides.  They have a  <br/>
lot of specialized equipment. The district is spending roughly in the  <br/>
neighborhood of $25,000 per year per child there, as compared to  <br/>
regular classrooms where they are spending roughly $7,000 per year per  <br/>
child.<br/>
