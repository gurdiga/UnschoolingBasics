<div id="ygrps-yiv-1038850382">I&#39;ve got to put in a plug for Dragon Rider by Corneila Funke - We have read it at least 3 times.  I don&#39;t know what ages you are looking for.  This is a great book for maybe 6-12.   Cressida Cowell also wrote How to Train a Dragon which my son who absolutely loves dragons really enjoyed.<br/>

homeschooling mom Rebecca Rupp and My father&#39;s dragon by Ruth Stiles <br/>
Gannett.  And Ruth Stiles Gannett has other dragon books too like <br/>
Elmer and the Dragon.  Or get the trilogy (I think) called Three Tales <br/>
of My Father&#39;s Dragon.  Laurie</div>
