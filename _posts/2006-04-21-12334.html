&gt; Really, I don&#39;t care if Brooke doesn&#39;t care<br/>
&gt; to know history right now, and I probably shouldn&#39;t even have it in my<br/>
&gt; mind as if it is something that she &#39;must&#39; care about ever.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The other thing is that there may be a small period of history that she will<br/>
love or an aspect of history.  I know people (thanks to the SCA) who could<br/>
talk your ear off about the middle ages but are clueless as to what the Bay<br/>
of PIgs was about.  I know people who were so deeply involved in Civil War<br/>
recreation that they decorated their whole house like a mini-anetebellum<br/>
mansion.  And I&#39;ve known people who were so fascinated with wars that the<br/>
only thing that they knew about history was what wars happened.  They can<br/>
tell you about the armament, the &quot;sides&quot; the issues, all the battles, but<br/>
the only reason they know that GWB is president is because he started a<br/>
war.  :)  I know people who love the history of fashion, or the use of<br/>
horses throughout history, or theatre, or historical film, or makeup, or<br/>
music, or cooking, or kings and successions.   It may be a long stretch of<br/>
time or a short period of time.  It could be music throughtout history or it<br/>
could be limited to the creation and evolution of jazz.<br/>
<br/>
History isn&#39;t about facts and dates.  The reason we study history is to<br/>
learn about ideas!  History is taught SO wrong in schools.  LIst of dates,<br/>
lists of names, lists of places and you have to put them all together.<br/>
That&#39;s not history.  History is not WWII.  WWII isn&#39;t about a bunch of<br/>
battles and the holocaust.  WWII is about how a dictatorship, allowing one<br/>
small-minded person to have too much power, is not a good thing.  WWII is<br/>
about righting an injustice of several groups of people.  The important<br/>
thing about WWII was not Hitler, Germany, the Japanese and Mousellini.  The<br/>
important thing that people should know about WWII is that it is wrong to<br/>
persecute people because of who they are.  If that is all that someone gets<br/>
out of WWII then that in itself is enough history (IMNSHO).<br/>
The same could be said of just about any subject.  What about science?  Some<br/>
people really like science.  They watch the Science channel all day and have<br/>
a periodic table hanging on their walls.  Other people only know enough<br/>
about science to be able to know that if they let go of something that it is<br/>
going to fall (gravity) unless it is filled with helium (or hydrogen) and<br/>
then it is going to rise.  They don&#39;t need to know that the reason that a<br/>
helium filled balloon rises is because helium is lighter than the<br/>
surrounding air nor that the surrounding air is made of a mixture of<br/>
nitrogen and oxygen (and a bunch of other things.)  Some people will want to<br/>
k now why other people are happy just knowing that if you drop something it<br/>
will fall and if you let go of a helium filled balloon it will rise.  And<br/>
that is good enough for them!  :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A few years ago, I read Benjamin Franklin&#39;s electricity papers. He  <br/>
was fascinated with science, and people were trying really hard at  <br/>
that time to figure out what the heck electricity was--was it a  <br/>
fluid? Little particles? They didn&#39;t know. But they could tell they  <br/>
were going to know soon, because people were doing all kinds of  <br/>
experiments, formulating hypotheses and testing them. It was pretty  <br/>
exciting.<br/>
<br/>
But at one point in his papers, he says something like--wait, thanks  <br/>
to Google, I can quote him:<br/>
<br/>
‘’Tis of real use to know that china left in the air unsupported will  <br/>
fall and break; but how it comes to fall, and why it breaks, are  <br/>
matters of speculation. ’Tis a pleasure indeed to know them, but we  <br/>
can preserve our china without it.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree - I hated, hated, HATED &quot;social studies&quot;, because it was just <br/>
dry facts, not how this effected people, what they thought.  My son <br/>
and I read things together and discuss them -- and you know, it is <br/>
astonishing (and often scary) how often history repeats itself.  <br/>
<br/>
The only ss class I ever had -- just a 1/4 of the year in 9th grade -- <br/>
that I enjoyed was a teacher deemed easy by the kids.  He taught India <br/>
(that year, each quarter, you studied a different area, out of 6 <br/>
possible, so no one got every area of the world).  He taught it in a <br/>
wonderful way, that was accessible to all the students.  It wasn&#39;t <br/>
that he was an easy teacher in that he gave easy tests, it was that he <br/>
was a GOOD teacher, and made it easy to LEARN.  But I did have one <br/>
friend that found his class harder -- she was lost without the <br/>
structure she was accustomed to.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you have a chance to read his autobiography do!  He was a fantastic<br/>
&quot;unschooly&quot; person.  He was ridiculed once when he was a young boy because<br/>
he wasted time by floating on his back on a lake.  He was holding onto a<br/>
kite (Ben and his kites) and letting the kite pull him around the lake.  His<br/>
mind was all a whirl on how this was happening and he enjoyed the feeling of<br/>
being pulled across the lake by just the wind&#39;s influence on the kite.  It&#39;s<br/>
a great story.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, the Mythbusters busted that Ben held a kite and it got struck with<br/>
lightening.  They believe that he was feeling the electrical particles in<br/>
the air, but that had his kite actually been hit by lightening, Ben would<br/>
not have been able to write about it afterwards!  We LOVE Mythbusters.  The<br/>
&quot;farting&quot; episode was our favorite!<br/>
