<div id="ygrps-yiv-215681820">I hope you all dont mind all my questions.   I live in Texas and although Texas is a very lenient state regarding homeschooling the law does state you must use a written curriculum.   How do you follow the law and unschooling at the same time?  It also states you have to teach good citizenship.  If any of you are in Texas can you tell me how you follow the law and unschool?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2047927910">Im in TX, I don&#39;t currently unschool but have and will again when my children decide they are done trying out public school. <br/>
Written curriculum does not mean x brand in a box....a library card and your computer fulfills the writen curriculum requirement :) . <br/>
If I may ask, are you in grayson county?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-330621057">I am in Texas and they do not require a written curriculum. Here is a blurb from the Texas Homeschool Coalition website on their FAQ page: &quot;In order to be a legitimate home school, you must have a curriculum which teaches reading, spelling, grammar, mathematics and a study of good citizenship, and you must pursue that curriculum in a bona fide (not a sham) manner. This curriculum may be obtained from any source and can consist of books, workbooks, other written materials, or materials on an electronic monitor including computer or video screens, or any combination thereof.&quot; You can read more at THSC&#39;s webpage <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.thsc.org/">http://www.thsc.org/</a> There is a wealth of information on their pages. Unschooling is a bona fide approach to education since you are providing ample learning opportunities for your children. School districts are not allowed to ask you about your curriculum and you do not have to register. There is no oversight in the state of Texas for homeschoolers. <br/>
<br/>
It might be helpful for you to look for local groups. There are unschooling groups in most of the major metro areas of Texas. You can go to the Yahoo groups page and do a search on Texas Unschoolers. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2119669694">If anybody questions you, all you have to do is send them a letter of assurance. That is it. They cannot question you and get in your business. The Texas Homeschool Coalition has gone after several school districts that have tried to overstep their bounds.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-299172020">I have read the laws for Texas but was unsure how they applied to unschooling.  Thank you all for helping me see how it all fits.  That is one less thin for me to question as I consider and explore unschooling.<br/>
