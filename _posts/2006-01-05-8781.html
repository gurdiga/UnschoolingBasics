<div id="ygrps-yiv-790005092">&quot; Over the last year, trust has been a big issue for us<br/>
(both her trust for us and our trust for her) and unschooling has<br/>
been such a blessing to us. It actually allowed Shawna&#39;s heart to be<br/>
free. :-)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is SO incredible...chalk one up for the healing power of unschooling.<br/>
I think adoptive parents with challenged kids have an incredible<br/>
strength and commitment, those kids are really lucky to have you. <br/>
I&#39;m so happy to hear about her growth and ability to flourish.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing that Joanne...very cool.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-63756762">&quot;But, after two and a half years of<br/>
living with us, she&#39;s in a different place, so we&#39;ll probably try<br/>
her off the wellbutrin in a few months, probably in the summer.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You probably already know this, but weaning a person off of those kind<br/>
of medications might be better than just cutting it off.<br/>
I have a good friend up here that just dropped an anti-depressant and<br/>
she told me how weird it feels, physically. She knew what to expect,<br/>
so she&#39;ll get through it, but a child might have a harder time....<br/>
