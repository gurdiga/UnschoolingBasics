My always-unschooled DD has started her first course there -- no verdict<br/>
yet on whether she will continue but I have heard reports from many<br/>
parents that they like FLVS.<br/>

&gt; Has anyone had experience with an on-line high school that they really<br/>
&gt; loved? I&#39;m tutoring a high school girl and the mother may be<br/>
&gt; interested in pulling her out of school and letting her learn at home,<br/>
&gt; and wants to know about on-line high schools. If you know of any,<br/>
&gt; please let me know!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>
