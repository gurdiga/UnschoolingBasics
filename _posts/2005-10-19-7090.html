<div id="ygrps-yiv-736251690">I&#39;m noticing that lots of you are in the northeast!!!!  Well, just for early warning, I&#39;ve just booked with a space to hold a Northeast Unschooling Gathering on Memorial Day Weekend, May 26-29ish, 2006 in Peabody, Massachusetts.  I&#39;ll have more details soon, and hopefully a website, but I wanted to give people lots of notice.<br/>

I&#39;m open to any ideas (with no guarantees).<br/>
