<div id="ygrps-yiv-727866919">Will dumped out my file box again today and instead of spending hours refiling I am slinging a lot of this stuff.  I found these notes, and since I saw a request for submissions of socialization articles come through here not long ago, I thought I&#39;d send them along in case anyone can use them:<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;The world of education is like an island where people, cut off from the world, are prepared for life by exclusion from it.&quot;<br/>
Maria Montessori in The Absorbant Mind, p 11<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;The family is always...a school of human relations in which children learn to live within a society.&quot;<br/>
David Elkind in The Hurried Child, p 120<br/>
 <br/>
FWIW!<br/>
