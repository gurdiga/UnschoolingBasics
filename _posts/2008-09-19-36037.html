<div id="ygrps-yiv-1926553728">Okay, now I&#39;m curious after all the discussion about the reasons for  <br/>
asking and the hints that people had some favorites :-)<br/>
<br/>
What are your favorite poetry writing resources? I&#39;m asking for  <br/>
myself, though some of it trickles out to Kat too. I don&#39;t love  <br/>
poetry (as one might classify it in school) but I do love playing  <br/>
with words and ideas and poets do that more succinctly than  <br/>
novelists :-)<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m asking more about the craft of it and helping others explore  <br/>
playing around with words. Every April I put up some poetry prompts  <br/>
for National Poetry Month on my writing blog that I have a lot of fun  <br/>
with.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
A couple of books I&#39;ve really liked are:<br/>
<br/>
Kenneth Koch&#39;s Wishes, Lies and Dreams<br/>
<br/>
Lots and lots of ideas for playing with ideas and words. Very simple  <br/>
exercises he did with inner city kids in New York that inspired some  <br/>
fun and profound poetry.<br/>
<br/>
Also Rose, Where Did You Get that Red?<br/>
<br/>
which is using the form and ideas of famous poems for inspiration by  <br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
There was another book too that he did from programs run in a senior  <br/>
center.<br/>

She used to come to the HSC conferences and do workshops. Awesome  <br/>
inspiration and support for getting our creativity out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1118177281">I read it many years ago and thought it was pretty good. Another one I liked was Rainer Maria Rilke: Letters to a Young Poet, and Aristoteles: Poetics which was required reading in my film class. Those were a long time ago so I don&#39;t remember much, just that I enjoyed them. My favorite (for writing screenplays, not so much poetry) was The Writer&#39;s Journey, based on Joseph Campbell&#39;s Hero with a Thousand Faces.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-440587702">...and subtitled, &quot;Freeing the Writer Within,&quot; it&#39;s by Natalie  <br/>
Goldberg. Excellent book.<br/>
<br/>
She also has audio books available for download or on CD at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://store.soundstrue.com/goldbergn.html">http://store.soundstrue.com/goldbergn.html</a><br/>
There are many authors and poets there, including Julia Cameron,  <br/>
