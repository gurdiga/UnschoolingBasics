<div id="ygrps-yiv-225377372">Hello Everybody,<br/>
I am reading on this list on and of for about a year. My friend gave <br/>
me the idea about unschooling and homeschooling and so I started to <br/>
get some information. Let me tell you, it is not easy to understand <br/>
this way of life but I am getting better, I hope lol. But now I need <br/>
an advice; my son ist 3,5 yo and all into computer games. He started <br/>
over a year ago when he saw me play Myst, so I showed him games on <br/>
nickjr and noggin.com. In the beginning he would play once a week, <br/>
maybe twice. But as he was getting better he wanted to play more and <br/>
more and I was getting worried about the time he was/is spending in <br/>
front of the computer. We still had our playtimes with his friend, <br/>
playtimes with me or his dad. In January his brother was born and <br/>
during the day I was/am not able anymore to play with him all the <br/>
time. He has little interested in playing by himself, he needs <br/>
running and jumping and moving and with the baby I am not able to <br/>
give him this kind of play, at least not all the time. So he ended up <br/>
with the games on the computer. And I am worried, mostly because I <br/>
think that to much screen time at his age is not good. My friend who <br/>
started me on the ideaof unschooling thinks the same and she is able <br/>
to set time limits on TV with her 2,5 yo. I tried but it would end up <br/>
with fighting, and this is not something that I would like to do. Can <br/>
I really trust my son with this, how can I do it when I myself think <br/>
that is not good for him. On the other hand I can see how much better <br/>
he is with those games but than again, is he not loosing a part of <br/>
his imagination (you know all this about brain damage, loosing <br/>
interest in books.....). I know that if he getts his needs met with <br/>
an active play, he will not be interested in games so much, but right <br/>
now I am not able to do it all day long, and I am short on other <br/>
ideas (we bake and cook together, he loves to play with water and <br/>
dirt, mixing stuff, making paint but it is nothing for 12 h a day. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1805428112">I would watch the games and see all that he is doing. Yesterday I spent a lot of the day playing on World of Warcraft with Simon and Linnaea. I worked on getting my newest character to level 10 and managed to hit level 11 as well. That was cool. World of Warcraft is different than the games I played with Simon when he was 3 and 4. We played a lot of Blues Clues and Tonka Construction games. He would sit on my lap and I&#39;d lean back and watch him play. It helped me to feel connected to what he was doing to be so present. When Linnaea came into the picture, when she was tiny, it was easy for me to sit with him while he was playing and hold her and bounce her and hang out with him. So I got to still to see the joy and the learning and the pleasure in what he was doing. There was only a brief time when I worried about Simon and games and that was in the leap from computer games to video games. But it quickly passed and he joyfully moved between mediums. <br/>
<br/>
There is so much going on in the games. So many different levels of experience. There is storytelling and art and puzzle solving and music and so many other things, and so much involvement offered to the player. One of my favorite websites aimed at younger players is the Boobahs website: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.boohbah.com/zone.html.">http://www.boohbah.com/zone.html.</a> I can remember sitting for hours with a friend&#39;s daughter on my lap playing on the Boobah site. Neopets is great and there are some really interesting games at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.funny-games.biz/main.html">http://www.funny-games.biz/main.html</a> that Simon and Linnaea play for ages. Line rider (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://linerider.com/play-line-rider-online)">http://linerider.com/play-line-rider-online)</a> is another amazing site. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.abc.net.au/arts/wingedsandals/">http://www.abc.net.au/arts/wingedsandals/</a> is a fantastic story-telling site with games based on Greek mythology. <br/>
<br/>
Screen time is such a dismissive term for such an amazing way to spend some time exploring the world. It is visual and kinesthetic and audial all at once. I love playing along with Simon and Linnaea, they&#39;ve opened so many doors to me. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1457396124">Hi Katherine,<br/>
<br/>
I know how easy it is to fall into the worry trap.  I have some <br/>
thoughts on the following.....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt;  In the beginning he would play once a week, <br/>
&gt; maybe twice. But as he was getting better he wanted to play more <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Isn&#39;t this just our human nature though?  When we become good at <br/>
something, it edifies us and fufills us to keep at it. Our <br/>
confidences soar when we eventually master something.  With that new-<br/>
found confidence, we then want to tackle something else.  Trust your <br/>
son!  He&#39;ll know when he&#39;s been fufilled.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We still had our playtimes with his friend, <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; playtimes with me or his dad. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Play will happen all the time, whether its been adult-initiated or <br/>
not.  Children are born to play.  Play is going on even when  no-one <br/>
is calling it &quot;play-time&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;In January his brother was born and <br/>
&gt; during the day I was/am not able anymore to play with him all the <br/>
&gt; time. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And you don&#39;t need to play with him all the time.  You just need to <br/>
enjoy his company, support him, talk to him, and make sure that his <br/>
home offers him things to explore and conquer.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He has little interested in playing by himself, he needs <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; running and jumping and moving and with the baby I am not able to <br/>
&gt; give him this kind of play, at least not all the time. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Children will always find ways to get their needs met.  You don&#39;t <br/>
have to have a structured playtime for running and jumping to <br/>
happen.  Just getting your little ones outside, whether it be a park, <br/>
your backyard, or whatever will set the stage for all sorts of play. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Can <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I really trust my son with this, <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;how can I do it when I myself think <br/>
&gt; that is not good for him. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why do you think its not good for him?  Is it really what you think <br/>
and how did you arrive to this conclusion?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;On the other hand I can see how much better <br/>
&gt; he is with those games but than again, is he not loosing a part of <br/>
&gt; his imagination (you know all this about brain damage, loosing <br/>
&gt; interest in books.....). <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have a feeling that kids losing interest in books has a lot more to <br/>
do with the pressure they are put under to read...not to mention <br/>
being forced to read materials they have no interest in.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I know that if he getts his needs met with <br/>
&gt; an active play, he will not be interested in games so much, but <br/>
 </span></blockquote>right <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; now I am not able to do it all day long, and I am short on other <br/>
&gt; ideas (we bake and cook together, he loves to play with water and <br/>
&gt; dirt, mixing stuff, making paint but it is nothing for 12 h a day. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It sounds like he is leading a great life!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What can I do or at least how can I be not so worried with this. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just trust.  It sounds easy, but we all know its not.  Just trust <br/>
him.  Enjoy him and your baby and tune out all the &quot;experts&quot; who are <br/>
all so ready to have us believe that we are wrecking our children if <br/>
we don&#39;t do X, Y and Z.   Get that worry out of your life and just <br/>
live!<br/>
<br/>
Blessings to you and your little ones,<br/>
<br/>
Mel<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It might be worth investing in some more play equipment for him - <br/>
some toys for bouncing and rolling and climbing and swinging and <br/>
spinning that he can play with in the house. We have a tiny little <br/>
house and not much budget, but we&#39;ve collected a bunch of stuff at <br/>
yardsales and dollar stores over the years. We sort of rotate <br/>
through toys as Mo loses interest - sometimes we have a skateboard <br/>
in the house, other times the sit-n-spin, others a big ball with a <br/>
handle for bouncing. When she was smaller we even had a small slide <br/>
in the house for awhile. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not suggesting this as an *alternative* to him being on the <br/>
computer, if that&#39;s what he wants to be doing right now. But its <br/>
good to know you have options and he&#39;s not just defaulting to that <br/>
bc there&#39;s nothing else fun that keeps him close to mom. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I know that if he getts his needs met with <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not necessarily true - my kids are both pretty active. They find <br/>
ways to get their physical needs met *and* spend plenty of time <br/>
watching tv and playing computer and video games.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; is he not loosing a part of <br/>
&gt; his imagination (you know all this about brain damage, loosing <br/>
&gt; interest in books.....).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t seen any evidence of brain damage or loss of imagination <br/>
with my kids. They are pretty creative, imaginative people. This <br/>
morning my 6yo was making chains of paper dolls that were gargoyles <br/>
and fairies - both of which she saw on cartoons, but is that so <br/>
terrible? She could just as easily have learned about them from a <br/>
book.<br/>
<br/>
Neither of my kids are big fans of books, but I don&#39;t think tv or <br/>
games are the cause. Its more a matter of their personalities and <br/>
the ways they learn things. Ray prefers more interactive learning <br/>
and entertainment, like games, and Mo is so visually oriented that <br/>
she&#39;d rather *see* a story than *hear* one read - and she doesn&#39;t <br/>
read well enough to get through the kinds of stories that interest <br/>
her. So watching tv and playing computer games is a way of expanding <br/>
both my kids&#39; worlds.<br/>

channels recently. They had a pediatrician on who actually admitted <br/>
that there is no evidence that TV causes any adverse effects or <br/>
problems with physical or mental health. She basically said that if <br/>
you do other things with your children periodically like read to them<br/>
(ignoring the comment about a set bedtime) they will be fine.<br/>

&gt; watching tv and playing computer and video games.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been wondering about this lately...the idea of people watching <br/>
hours of TV and, therefor, not getting outside and getting physical <br/>
activity/exercise and being healthy. How much of this is tied to the <br/>
idea of the average child/adult who spends 6-8 hours a day at <br/>
school/work and only has a few hours at home before needing to go to <br/>
bed so s/he can get up and go to school/work the next day? I&#39;ve read <br/>
that a lot of school time is wasteful. It doesn&#39;t really take a <br/>
child 6-8 hours to do all the work that&#39;s required but it does take <br/>
that long to wrangle all of those kids. If you were to do &quot;school&quot; <br/>
at home, it would take you half the time. <br/>
<br/>
I experienced this when I first started homeschooling. I got a bunch <br/>
of textbooks and a guideline of what work to do and when. My son was <br/>
done with all of the daily textbook work within 2 hours. It was the <br/>
same work that was done in a 6-7 subject school day.<br/>
<br/>
So, my point is that if we spend so much more time at home with our <br/>
children with everyone learning all the time, doesn&#39;t it make sense <br/>
that they could get more screen time just because they have more <br/>
time in general and still get just as much learning and physical <br/>
activity and exercise or maybe even more than if they spent 6-8 <br/>
hours at school? An hour of physical exercise...that leaves about 12 <br/>
hours to do whatever. So then 4 or 6 hours watching TV anb/or <br/>
playing computer games still leaves a lot of time to do other things.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;playing computer and video games.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>LOL Granted, DS is almost 10 (not 3 anymore wahhh!), but when he plays<br/>
videogames it&#39;s like watching an aerobic workout (blessings on whoever<br/>
invented wireless game controllers!) He bounces, jumps, walks, wiggles,<br/>
bends, and in general is not sitting still - his whole self is involved.<br/>
Ever see one of those REALLY happy puppies who wags from shoulders to<br/>
tail? That&#39;d be DS when he&#39;s playing a videogame (even a fairly calm<br/>
game like golf). For that matter, he&#39;s bouncing and moving while he&#39;s<br/>
*watching* someone else play even! <br/>
For small indoor spaces, his favorite since he was 2 is one of those<br/>
exercise trampolines - they run maybe 30 inches in diameter roughly and<br/>
stand about a hand span off the floor and are available pretty readily<br/>
and inexpensively. He&#39;d bounce while watching TV or playing a videogame<br/>
(he could simultaneously bounce on the trampoline, move his character<br/>
and keep an eye on the other characters all at the same time - it<br/>
boggled my mind since it was about all I could do to simply keep from<br/>
repeatedly bumping into walls!)<br/>

I&#39;ve wondered about this too.  The recommended &quot;hour&quot; of tv a day, just<br/>
seems so limiting, especially if children have ALL DAY to explore and<br/>
learn!<br/>
<br/>
But I do still wonder about the addiction factor.  My 6yo seems to be almost<br/>
addicted to the computer/tv.  He doesn&#39;t take much interest in anything else<br/>
lately.  Even things he used to love!  He actually said to me the other day,<br/>
&quot;Mommy, I wish I liked board games again, so I could play with you guys.&quot;<br/>
He&#39;s a pretty shy kid, and I feel like sometimes he doesn&#39;t want to go<br/>
places with us, because it&#39;s easier to just stay home and play on the<br/>
computer than to have to deal with other people.  Any way I put it, it just<br/>
never sounds fun to get out and play (even if there are no other people<br/>
involved).  Has this happened with anyone else?  Will it get better?<br/>

&gt; &gt; watching tv and playing computer and video games.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been wondering about this lately...the idea of people watching<br/>
&gt; hours of TV and, therefor, not getting outside and getting physical<br/>
&gt; activity/exercise and being healthy. How much of this is tied to the<br/>
&gt; idea of the average child/adult who spends 6-8 hours a day at<br/>
&gt; school/work and only has a few hours at home before needing to go to<br/>
&gt; bed so s/he can get up and go to school/work the next day? I&#39;ve read<br/>
&gt; that a lot of school time is wasteful. It doesn&#39;t really take a<br/>
&gt; child 6-8 hours to do all the work that&#39;s required but it does take<br/>
&gt; that long to wrangle all of those kids. If you were to do &quot;school&quot;<br/>
&gt; at home, it would take you half the time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I experienced this when I first started homeschooling. I got a bunch<br/>
&gt; of textbooks and a guideline of what work to do and when. My son was<br/>
&gt; done with all of the daily textbook work within 2 hours. It was the<br/>
&gt; same work that was done in a 6-7 subject school day.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, my point is that if we spend so much more time at home with our<br/>
&gt; children with everyone learning all the time, doesn&#39;t it make sense<br/>
&gt; that they could get more screen time just because they have more<br/>
&gt; time in general and still get just as much learning and physical<br/>
&gt; activity and exercise or maybe even more than if they spent 6-8<br/>
&gt; hours at school? An hour of physical exercise...that leaves about 12<br/>
&gt; hours to do whatever. So then 4 or 6 hours watching TV anb/or<br/>
&gt; playing computer games still leaves a lot of time to do other things.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Passions can look and feel like addictions.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s not. If TV and video games were addicting, then unschooled  <br/>
kids would be addicted.<br/>
<br/>
Plenty of unschooled kids have gone through periods of high use, but  <br/>
the none have shown the long term effects of addiction: needing more  <br/>
and greater fixes, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
Try reading the following.  Scroll down, it&#39;s the last on, it starts  <br/>
with &quot;Hi&quot; I went into TV and addiction pretty thoroughly.<br/>

And to see it clearly, he&#39;s not watching TV or the computer. He&#39;s not  <br/>
turning the TV on and watching whatever comes on. Same with the  <br/>
computer. He&#39;s using both to find things that interest him. They&#39;re  <br/>
access portals. Just like libraries are access portals to books.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than looking at the box he&#39;s looking at, sit with him and see  <br/>
what he explores and talk about what&#39;s interesting him. Don&#39;t sit  <br/>
with the idea of getting him off, but of immersing in the world with  <br/>
him. Understand the draw so he has someone to talk to who understands.<br/>
<br/>
Find *more* that he can do with what draws him. Boy, did I know a lot  <br/>
about Pokemon when my daughter was that age ;-) We were immersed in a  <br/>
world of Pokemon. But don&#39;t see it as a way of pulling him from  <br/>
something but as expanding on interests that are already there. If he  <br/>
feels you pulling, he&#39;s likely to hold on tighter.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He doesn&#39;t take much interest in anything else<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Passions can be that way. And they do eat up a lot of time!<br/>
<br/>
One thing about TV is that kids can feel trapped by the TV station&#39;s  <br/>
schedule. They feel they need to be in front of the TV when the  <br/>
stations show the child&#39;s favorite programs. And what episode of the  <br/>
program the stations show can feel random, so there&#39;s an even more  <br/>
compelling reason to stick around.<br/>
<br/>
TiVo/DVRs can be great for that. Series can be set to record and then  <br/>
the shows can be watched anytime the child wants.<br/>
<br/>
Before they were invented, I put in VHS tapes to record programs so  <br/>
my daughter felt free to leave the TV. Very often she didn&#39;t bother  <br/>
watching the show she&#39;d taped. What she wanted was to be in control  <br/>
of what and when. You can also buy many series on DVD. (Check Amazon  <br/>
for used copies.)<br/>
<br/>
It might help to read books about passionate people so he can see  <br/>
he&#39;s not alone :-)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It could be a sign that he&#39;s getting ready to move on. It may take a  <br/>
while still.<br/>
<br/>
Reassure him that passions can be all consuming. Ask him if he&#39;d like  <br/>
to start ex<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And if you were a social person and someone wanted you to stay at  <br/>
home and play on the computer but you *really* didn&#39;t like it, would  <br/>
it make you love computers if they made you?<br/>
<br/>
I think people see &quot;shy&quot; and computers and project that into the  <br/>
future of adult children living in their parents&#39; basement with only  <br/>
the internet for company. But all those people were conventionally  <br/>
parented. And all those kids were forced to socialize from a young  <br/>
age, weren&#39;t they?<br/>
<br/>
Well, yeah, the thinking might go, but they&#39;re extreme cases. And  <br/>
there would have been a lot more except for parents pushing. And  <br/>
parent who believe that spanking and tight control creates upstanding  <br/>
young adults, believe that they didn&#39;t spank enough and weren&#39;t  <br/>
controlling enough when their kids rebel.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just a trap to project some fuzzy theory into some fuzzy future.  <br/>
Without a &quot;control group&quot; -- kids that weren&#39;t pressured to be social  <br/>
-- there&#39;s no way of separating the effects of the pressure from the  <br/>
shyness.<br/>
<br/>
But unschoolers can ;-) We&#39;re the control group.<br/>
<br/>
As a shy person, I can tell you the very best thing you can do for  <br/>
him is support who he is and allow him to come to society in his own  <br/>
way. If he needs to hang back and watch, let him hang back and watch.  <br/>
If he needs to be only with the family, let him grow in security that  <br/>
he&#39;s whole and loved and you&#39;ll nurture confidence. By pushing him  <br/>
beyond his comfort zone you&#39;re whittling away his confidence. He  <br/>
*will* reach out when he&#39;s ready if you don&#39;t make him feel broken,  <br/>
if you don&#39;t make society feel like it&#39;s something scary that he  <br/>
needs to brave.<br/>

Are there games you can play together on the computer? Can you look <br/>
into getting some new board games? Maybe there&#39;s some other new <br/>
activity y&#39;all can do together. <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s saying &quot;I want to connect more&quot; and he&#39;s looking for a way to <br/>
do that - but he doesn&#39;t enjoy the way y&#39;all *used* to connect - why <br/>
should he? People change, and especially kids. He might like <br/>
something new. Or he might be looking for a way to say &quot;I wish you&#39;d <br/>
play Super Smash Mario with me&quot; that won&#39;t get his feelings hurt if <br/>
you say &quot;I don&#39;t want to play your favorite game with you&quot;. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do you have a laptop or hand-held game? That could be a really <br/>
useful tool for stepping outside his comfort zone. Mo often likes to <br/>
watch tv or a movie when we go visiting - and often not the whole <br/>
time. She just needs a little something to help her transition to <br/>
being around people, and a way to get a break from people. <br/>
<br/>
If your guy is kind of an introvert, its good to understand that <br/>
dealing with other people takes effort on his part - it uses energy <br/>
whereas being alone recharges his batteries. So finding ways for him <br/>
to get some &quot;space&quot; going out may be helpful. And tv/movies/games <br/>
can do that in the way reading a chapter of a book might do that for <br/>
someone else. <br/>
<br/>
Or, your guy may just be totally passionate about games right now <br/>
and want to play them All the Time. A game he can take with him lets <br/>
him have his cake and eat it - he could play at the park! at the <br/>
beach! in the woods! Don&#39;t flinch! Its not inherently worse than a <br/>
kid wanting to bring a book. <br/>

with kids sitting at desks in school all day with an hour for gym <br/>
class.Kids who spend 4-6 hours watching TV, gaming or on the computer <br/>
are still sitting for the same amount of time ,so it is certainly no <br/>
worse. They do have the added benefits of choosing to get up and get a <br/>
drink, go to the bathroom, get a snack,talk whenever they want or need <br/>
to, just plain quit doing it and also having subject matter they are <br/>
actually interested in! 6 hours of computer looks so different in this <br/>
light.<br/>
