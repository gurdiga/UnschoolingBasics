<div id="ygrps-yiv-1063484265"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;My son too loved the leash too. We even put it on one of those retractable<br/>
 </span></blockquote>thingys so that he could go a little further. We only used it in busy open<br/>
places like fairs and festivals. My daughter picked hers out before I even<br/>
knew what it was. It is a little monkey packpack that has a matching tether.<br/>
We haven&#39;t used it for anything more then a stuffed animal yet but then she<br/>
just began really wanting to walk around outside instead of riding the<br/>
stroller.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Our dd loved her leash as well.  She has always been into animals.  When she<br/>
was 2 she could make tons of animal sounds and did so frequently.  I would<br/>
use a leash if I had to go to the mall or somewhere the possibility of her<br/>
getting away from me could happen.  I lost her once in Dillards (a large<br/>
department store).  In a blink she darted off and decided to play hide &<br/>
seek in the clothes rack.  Nearly gave me a heart attack.  I did not have<br/>
the choice of waiting until my DH got home to do my shopping nor did I have<br/>
family near to help out.  My dh was in graduate school and working 2 jobs<br/>
for me to be able to stay home with our dd.  So I did what I had to do.<br/>
However, all that to say...everytime I would put the leash on her (it was<br/>
the harness type) she would immediately start barking like a dog!  People<br/>
passing by got a real kick out of it and some gave me the &quot;look&quot; as if I<br/>
wasn&#39;t a very good mom.  We made it a game and had fun with it.  I guess it<br/>
is all in how you treat it.  By the time our younger dd came along I had<br/>
help and never had to use a leash with her.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-741759514">Do they make these things for husbands? EVERY TIME we go shopping, he <br/>
sees someone he knows and they talk....and talk...and talk. <br/>
While I wait....and wait....and wait! LOL!!<br/>
