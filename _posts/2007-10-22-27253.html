<div id="ygrps-yiv-800945351">All, she has decided to be home! At least for the rest of this  <br/>
semester...which is a start and good! (Grace, age 15)<br/>
 <br/>
Questions...she wants an assignment every day...ugh...I guess I need to  move <br/>
slowly into unschooling. Thoughts, ideas? I told her I&#39;d like to take some  <br/>
time to help her discover her interests and revive her curiosity and then we  <br/>
should take that from there. <br/>
 <br/>
ok- I filed an affidavit in April...it expired and I did not do it again.  <br/>
Ooops. Should I do that now anyway, or do it again now, since now I have an  <br/>
older child as a part of this? <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m exited. Happy. Scared a bit too. Trust breeds trust, Trust breeds  <br/>
trust,Trust breeds trust,Trust breeds trust,Trust breeds trust....my mantra  :)<br/>

I&#39;d love to! But she really struggles with assimilating information via  <br/>
lengthy reading. But I am still thinking about at least maybe a few sections,  <br/>
perhaps. I&#39;ve connected her to one other girl, close in age, and that has  <br/>
already seemed to have lit a small light. She sees that she is a bit  <br/>
funky-mainstream, like Grace is, and I think that opened her eyes a bit, which  helps to <br/>
open her &quot;gut&quot; I think. <br/>

wanted assignments when she first left school.  She got over that <br/>
pretty quickly : )  I got her a membership at audible.com so she can <br/>
down load books onto her ipod.  With the membership cost she gets <br/>
one free download a month.  She really likes that.  I don&#39;t know if <br/>
they have Teenage Liberation Handbook but it&#39;s a good resource.  <br/>
