<div id="ygrps-yiv-482191976">I am interested in hearing other peoples stories about their switch <br/>
from working mom to stay at home/homeschooling/unschooling mom with <br/>
an older child.<br/>
I am having a hard time adjusting to this change. We took my ds (11) <br/>
out of school in September and started &quot;light&quot; homeschooling in <br/>
October. That didn&#39;t go over well, so we decided to continue de-<br/>
schooling and that lead into unschooling. My son spends the majority <br/>
of his time playing computer or video games, watching TV, and <br/>
playing Warhammer-type battles. Overall I would say he&#39;s fairly <br/>
happy with what he&#39;s doing. I try to connect by watching what he&#39;s <br/>
doing on the computer, asking questions, sitting with him while he <br/>
watches TV, suggest possible things to do (go to the park, <br/>
swimming...), most of which he refuses, and battle with him when he <br/>
wants to play Warhammer. All of this seems so very passive though. <br/>
At the end of every day I feel like I haven&#39;t accomplished anything. <br/>
When I was at work I was able to interact with others and I felt <br/>
that I accomplished something concrete every day. My dh works long <br/>
hours, so it&#39;s mostly my ds & I hanging out at home. Ds doesn&#39;t want <br/>
to leave the house very often. So...<br/>
1. How did you deal with making the change from working mom to stay <br/>
at home mom? How did you develop other interests when your child <br/>
mostly wants to stay home? <br/>
2. How did you connect with your child when he&#39;s doing stuff that he <br/>
really only wants an audience for, not an active participant or is <br/>
playing computer/ video games or just watching TV?<br/>
3. How do you start to expand his world when he doesn&#39;t want to <br/>
leave the house?<br/>
4. Is this just a phase that is common for kids who have had a rough <br/>
time at school when they first start unschooling?<br/>
Any thoughts, ideas or stories would be appreciated.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1499748009">I&#39;m going to respond, even though I didn&#39;t make the transition from<br/>
working mom to sahm, even though we don&#39;t unschool (I consider us<br/>
relaxed hsers, though), even though my ds didn&#39;t have a rough school<br/>
experience.<br/>
<br/>
We did start homeschooling when he was 10.5, though, so later in the<br/>
game than a lot of people.  I do remember thinking, &quot;OMG!  I only have<br/>
7 years!&quot;  Now, of course, I go into panic mode, thinking, &quot;I only<br/>
have a bit over 2 years!&quot;  Seven years sounds so gloriously long, now!<br/>
<br/>
But if your son had a rough time in school, he may have a conditioned<br/>
reaction to anything seeming schooly.  So your trick will be to think<br/>
outside the box, or in the case of tv, within the box.  TV CAN be<br/>
educational, even stuff that seems more entertaining.  Animal planet,<br/>
perhaps, or even history channel.  How about things like Dirty Jobs,<br/>
Mythbusters?  <br/>
<br/>
Computer games can be an avenue, too.  My son used to play Battlefield<br/>
1942, then after a while, asked if we could study WWII.  So, I went to<br/>
the library, took out WWII for Dummies (or was it Idiot&#39;s guide...)<br/>
and we studied WWII.  (I actually read aloud to him, and we discussed<br/>
the stuff.  At the time, we were watching reruns of the later part of<br/>
the Star Trek: Deep Space 9 series, and saw a lot of parallels.)  At<br/>
one point, he got very animated, and said (about the battle of<br/>
Stalingrad) &quot;That&#39;s exactly how it plays out in the game!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
What interests does he have, did he have before, or what things do you<br/>
think he might find interesting.  One idea is to &quot;seed&quot; the house with<br/>
books you get at the library, and see what he picks up.  Also consider<br/>
magazines.  Some kids prefer the idea of more bite-sized articles to<br/>
full books.  Find other homeschoolers in your area and connect with<br/>
them -- the kids he hangs out with may spur on some other interests,<br/>
too.  Again, it may not look like what we had as school, but if he has<br/>
that toxic reaction still, that may be to the good.  If he finds<br/>
something interesting enough, he may delve deeper for his own fun.<br/>
<br/>
My son taught himself a number of polymer clay techniques from library<br/>
books when he was in that phase.  (Probably around 11ish, come to<br/>
think of it.)  He made some pretty cool stuff.  He&#39;s since moved on,<br/>
but I still play with it, and occasionally he does, just not often. <br/>
He is more into creating computer games, or playing computer games (he<br/>
does both - his big addiction is Runescape.)  He currently says he<br/>
wants to be a computer game programmer (not designer, per se) so is<br/>
working some to develop those skills.  <br/>
<br/>
You might consider having some playdates or other activities at your<br/>
house if he currently is interested in hanging out at home.  But if he<br/>
is withdrawing from all social contact, then I think you need to<br/>
discuss with him that it is unhealthy for him to do that.  Not that he<br/>
needs to be on the go all the time, but that when there is a<br/>
reasonable opportunity to get out and meet people, or play with<br/>
friends he currently knows, he needs to take it.  (Is it more that he<br/>
isn&#39;t interested in making new friends?   Some kids have a hard time<br/>
with that, and it may take more work on your part to help him learn<br/>
the skills he needs to develop that.  Shyness is NOT an excuse for<br/>
being a recluse.  I used to be painfully, horribly shy, but worked<br/>
hard at overcoming it.  Still lurks inside me, but I do get out and<br/>
about.)<br/>
<br/>
What interests do YOU want to develop?  Sometimes, while you are<br/>
focusing in and learning interesting new things, your child may come<br/>
along and want to know what you are doing.  If it piques his interest<br/>
enough, he may join you.  That&#39;s a plus.  <br/>
<br/>
Try to figure out why he doesn&#39;t want to expand his horizons right<br/>
now.  That may be more helpful in figuring out what to do than<br/>
anything else I&#39;ve said.  If you get some feedback from him, and still<br/>
are at a loss, come back with more details!  BTW, I do find that<br/>
picking a good time and discussing your concerns with your child - and<br/>
asking for suggestions - can sometimes yield surprising results.  They<br/>
may have ideas you hadn&#39;t thought of.  Or not -- it&#39;s a crap shoot!<br/>

<br/>
1. How did you deal with making the change from working mom to stay<br/>
at home mom? How did you develop other interests when your child<br/>
mostly wants to stay home?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well, I didn&#39;t give it up totally. I still work from home very <br/>
occasionally for a few extra bucks each week.<br/>
<br/>
As far as deveoping other interests---well, what are you DOing all day? <br/>
Do you need to go OUT to do new things? I took up gardening, <br/>
bee-keeping, fencing (as in touche---not building them---although I did <br/>
that too! &lt;g&gt;). I write almost every day. I started the unschooling <br/>
conference and this list as well as a local list and accountability <br/>
association. We&#39;ve raised rats and rabbits. We&#39;re looking at getting <br/>
chickens. We&#39;ve raised guide dog pups. I joined Toastmasters. I painted <br/>
every room in the house. Really the only two of those things that <br/>
require I GO OUT are the fencing and Toastmasters, both of which have <br/>
taken a backseat lately as I&#39;ve been too busy at home.<br/>
<br/>
I know I&#39;m a bit more hyper than most &lt;g&gt;, but I can&#39;t imagine sitting <br/>
around waiting for my kids to want to do something. What kind of <br/>
example would that be? They need to see me doing new things. Maybe one <br/>
of the things I do will inspire them to do something new.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
2. How did you connect with your child when he&#39;s doing stuff that he<br/>
really only wants an audience for, not an active participant or is<br/>
playing computer/ video games or just watching TV?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Brush his hair while I watch. Rub his shoulders or feet. Bring him <br/>
snacks.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t get into the gaming. I watch when he asks, but generally that&#39;s <br/>
when we each have alone time. I&#39;m in the garden.<br/>
<br/>
TV we wtached together often.  I get tired of the cartoons, but I like <br/>
to watch The Most Extreme and other Animal Planet things with him. <br/>
He&#39;ll watch the History Channel with me. Recently, he&#39;s really gotten <br/>
into the Greeks because of his new game, Gods of War II. That led us to <br/>
The Spartans on the History Channel---and the new movie The 300 (but he <br/>
doesn&#39;t think he wants to see it---too gory). Lots of mythology talk <br/>
lately. But I love all things Greek and Roman! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
3. How do you start to expand his world when he doesn&#39;t want to<br/>
leave the house?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Bring things home. New games. New food. New movies. New people.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
4. Is this just a phase that is common for kids who have had a rough<br/>
time at school when they first start unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
It really is! Cameron had almost 18 months of doing nothing except <br/>
sleep, talk on the phone, watch tv, IM on the computer, and eat. <br/>
Seriously. It was horrible. It felt as if it would never end. It did. <br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We pulled him out at the end of 6th grade. He was just 13.<br/>
<br/>
He was healing. It was necessary for him to feel whole again. Now, at <br/>
19, he&#39;s so busy, we hardly see him.<br/>
<br/>
DO for yourself. Ask him to join you. Be OK with no for an answer. Keep <br/>
asking. Keep doing. Be interested in what he&#39;s doing. Be interesting <br/>
with that you do. (Don&#39;t be a lump!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1351141406">Hey Arlene,<br/>
<br/>
I am an unschooling Mum to two, 9 and 7 years old. My son went to school for 4 years before we started homeschooling, leading to unschooling.<br/>
1. How did you deal with making the change from working mom to stay <br/>
at home mom? How did you develop other interests when your child <br/>
mostly wants to stay home? <br/>
<br/>
Did you mean develop other interests for you or for your son? If you meant for your son I think you just ahve to let it flow and eventually he will find interest in other areas. You&#39;ve already seen his interest develop from a game to history. You want him to be ineterested in things other than computer games? I believe that will come naturally too, the greater part of last year all my son wanted to do was play computer/playstation games or watch tv. If you meant to develop more interests for yourself take up a hobby; there are many things that you can do at home or with ocassional outings, collecting (ebay), scrapbooking, sewing, etc. You may find that something you show an interest in piques your son&#39;s interest also. If you are looking for something in which you can make a visible achievement each day you could undertake a course of study via correspondence; there are many interest based rather than skill based courses available.<br/>
<br/>
3. How do you start to expand his world when he doesn&#39;t want to <br/>
leave the house?<br/>
<br/>
As I said above; you&#39;ve already seen his world expand from a game to history, the same game might next lead him to story telling, physics, social relationships, justice, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
4. Is this just a phase that is common for kids who have had a rough <br/>
time at school when they first start unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
Not just a rough time; I believe it&#39;s common for any child who has been in school, my son loved school until I said he didn&#39;t have to go._,_._,___ <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; 3. How do you start to expand his world when he doesn&#39;t want to <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is it that he doesn&#39;t want to go anywhere or that you haven&#39;t found <br/>
anything to offer that sounds fun to him? My stepson goes to the <br/>
skatepark and that&#39;s about it. He&#39;s been deschooling since Nov. A <br/>
big part of that is that soooooo many other things still <br/>
scream &quot;Educational Experience! Resist!&quot; in his mind. He needs time <br/>
to heal. <br/>
<br/>
Another thing I&#39;m seeing with my stepson is that with the exception <br/>
of his girlfriend, who he met at camp last summer, all his school <br/>
friends were friends of necessity - they aren&#39;t people he *really* <br/>
wants to spend time with now that he has a choice about how to spend <br/>
his time. He&#39;s slowly starting to get to know people at the <br/>
skatepark and online - people he can connect with via shared <br/>
interests. That takes time though. Think about it this way: how many <br/>
new friends (not acquantances) have you made in the past year? <br/>
<br/>
Does your ds have any philosophical issues he&#39;s working on? That&#39;s <br/>
something that occupies a big space in Ray&#39;s life right now, but <br/>
he&#39;s a couple years older than your guy. Some teens go through a <br/>
really intense period of engagement with big, deep, powerful ideas <br/>
and need to be supported through that. It can be a time of profound <br/>
personal growth, but it can also be a time of drawing away from <br/>
other people, especially if no-one else seems to be on the same <br/>
page. If you ds is doing this kind of thinking right now, &quot;getting <br/>
him out of the house&quot; may only frustrate him more.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 1. How did you deal with making the change from working mom to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>stay <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; at home mom?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I did this when my dd was less than a year old, so not all of <br/>
my experiences will apply. One thing that really helped *me* though, <br/>
was to stop thinking &quot;stay at home mom&quot; and start thinking &quot;full <br/>
time professional mom&quot;. That made it easier for me to focus a <br/>
certain amount of my energy on learning better parenting skills, <br/>
observing my kid more closely, taking my child&#39;s needs more <br/>
seriously in the moment. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How did you develop other interests when your child <br/>
&gt; mostly wants to stay home? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What sorts of things interest you *now*? Can you create a home-study <br/>
course for yourself? Take a class or join a club that meets one <br/>
night a week? Get brave and try something that facinates you but <br/>
you&#39;re afraid you have no apptitude for?<br/>
<br/>
In the past few years I&#39;ve: taken an online course in education, <br/>
learned to juggle, started knitting, taken a wine-tasting class <br/>
(loved the homework!), learned to identify a few birds, dabbled with <br/>
piano playing, discovered auctions, started learning about fire poi, <br/>
built some fences and stone walls, played with oragami, and dabbled <br/>
with astronomy. I&#39;ve also expanded some older interests, like sewing <br/>
and gardening. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not necessarily *good* at all those things. I still have a <br/>
fairly narrow interest in wines, for example, but I know what I like <br/>
a lot more clearly. And I&#39;m not the world&#39;s best juggler by any <br/>
stretch of the imagination, but I enjoy it and its good exercise. <br/>

what she imagines he should be doing? &lt;bwg&gt; yeah, that&#39;s a really <br/>
normal phase to go through. Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll be fine ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1141854706">Linda, Kelly, Anita and Meredith:<br/>
Thanks for giving me your ideas as well as your experiences!<br/>
<br/>
I think that you&#39;re right and ds is healing right now and that&#39;s why <br/>
he isn&#39;t overly interested in socializing with others. I&#39;ll give him <br/>
the time he needs and trust that he&#39;ll turn out OK.:-} In the <br/>
meantime I&#39;ll try getting books from the library that may interest <br/>
him and introduce him to other new things that he may enjoy. <br/>
<br/>
As for me, I&#39;ll start doing things and see if he would like to help <br/>
out. I think that I&#39;m going through a bit of culture shock  I&#39;ve <br/>
always rushed around working, taking care of the house and the <br/>
family and now I&#39;m looking at quitting my job (I&#39;m  currently on a <br/>
leave of absence) to stay home and I don&#39;t know what to do with <br/>
myself. Most of it is probably my expectations, that things are <br/>
unresolved at work, and that I&#39;m feeling guilty because now I&#39;m <br/>
dependant on my spouse and I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m really doing <br/>
anything productive other than watching my son and trying to connect <br/>
with him on his terms. Anyway, I&#39;ll take your advice and try and <br/>
find things that interest me and we&#39;ll go from there<br/>
Thanks again for all your ideas,<br/>
