<div id="ygrps-yiv-177407999">I am the mother of an 18-month-old boy (so, I&#39;m a bit ahead of the <br/>
game as far as schooling issues).  My husband agrees with <br/>
homeschooling and is pretty much okay on the concept of <br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot;, but needs some work to get to &quot;radical unschooling&quot;.  <br/>
He asked me to come up with some information on specific topics to <br/>
give him an idea of what I&#39;m talking about and how it would work &quot;in <br/>
the real world&quot;.  I&#39;ve been to Sandra Dodd&#39;s page (very helpful), but <br/>
still have a few categories I&#39;d love a brief response on that I can <br/>
pass his way.  I wish I could just encourage him to read this list <br/>
(or a book or something) but he&#39;s not big on reading, so he needs the <br/>
Cliff Notes version.<br/>
<br/>
Here are the issues I need some help with:<br/>
<br/>
 - Discipline/Rewards: I know the answer is &quot;No&quot; but I need a but <br/>
more than that to give him.<br/>
 - Personal Hygiene<br/>
 - Manners<br/>
<br/>
I also know that modeling is the way the last two work, but again, <br/>
that&#39;s not enough for hubby.  Life examples are also welcome, but <br/>
more importantly, he needs the theory, I think.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for any help you&#39;re able to provide.  Feel free to <br/>
email me off-list if you either don&#39;t want your information public or <br/>
feel that it won&#39;t be of benefit to others besides me.  :)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1695853782">- Discipline/Rewards: I know the answer is &quot;No&quot; but I need a but more than<br/>
that to give him.<br/>
 - Personal Hygiene<br/>
 - Manners<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The discipline/rewards issue I find hard to address without a specific issue<br/>
to talk about, (love alfie Kohn&#39;s book &quot;Punished by Rewards&quot;) but if you<br/>
start now living by principles instead of rules, taking time to explain<br/>
things in terms your child can understand, and by being respectful of<br/>
others, your child, and yourself, you will find that you won&#39;t need to<br/>
discipline or reward your child for their behavior.  Make it easy for them<br/>
to do the right thing.  Be with them and help them to make good choices.  <br/>
<br/>
When my children were small they loved baths.  As they go older, it became<br/>
more of a chore to have a bath because the bath took time out from other fun<br/>
things. My kids can get away with a bath every 5 to 7 days now without<br/>
smelling noticably bad or having hair so tangly that it is a pain.  They can<br/>
go longer in the summer when we swim often.  The best motivation to bathe<br/>
has come from smelling other people who need a bath.  :)  They don&#39;t want to<br/>
smell that bad and I warn them when they are getting kind of ripe.  As much<br/>
as they&#39;d rather not bathe, they rather not smell bad even worse, so they<br/>
bathe.  <br/>
<br/>
Teeth brushing was never a big issue for us. When the kids didn&#39;t want to do<br/>
it, I just brought the brush to them and did it for them where ever they<br/>
were playing.  It wasn&#39;t so much that they didn&#39;t want clean teeth as it was<br/>
that they didn&#39;t want to take the time out to brush them.<br/>
<br/>
Manners...hmm.  Kids really learn these by example.  If you are polite, your<br/>
children will learn to be polite.  It drives me nuts now when people<br/>
interupt kids to tell them to say please or thank you, even though I did it<br/>
when my kids were small. (I&#39;ve learned a lot) You can ask something nicely<br/>
without saying please.  Just the other day dh told one of the kids to say<br/>
please even though they asked for something quite politely.  But he didn&#39;t<br/>
say thank you after eating the dinner I cooked and served.  :)<br/>

Check out Alfie Kohn&#39;s Unconditional Parenting.  He gives lots of  facts and <br/>
figures to support his ideas.   Supposedly there is a  DVD version, too, which <br/>
sometimes is better for DH&#39;s than reading a book.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1692062182">I agree with the book recomendation.<br/>
Its a great book for your dh to read.<br/>
Also like someone else wrote- manners are learned by example.<br/>
My 3 years old is very polite and always says ( OK almost always) thank you and please and I NEVER told him to do so but I always said thank you and please to him (and not only to other people around). I always treat him like I would treat anyone else, like a real person and not just a &quot;child&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I could go on and on bragging about my &quot;always unschooled son&quot;...and he is a very outspoken, strong-willed, self-assured, gentle, intense, loving, caring, vibrant, explosive little guy. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Mostly true.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen parents who are truly sweet and gentle and polite and the  <br/>
kids seem harsh and rude and demanding. I DO think parents ought to  <br/>
let kids know when they&#39;re being discourteous  and actually talk to  <br/>
them about why courtesy is useful in lubricating social interactions  <br/>
and so on. In other words, I think my kids (who are generally very  <br/>
well-mannered) learned mostly from just living with parents who  <br/>
behaved with good manners, but I do think there are times for  <br/>
discussions AND times to bring things directly to kids&#39; attention.  <br/>
And I do not think parents should let kids be really disruptive.<br/>
<br/>
If a child IS being rude, for example, in a restaurant, and  <br/>
disturbing other customers - I would not punish the child, no hand- <br/>
slapping, no verbal reprimand (how many times have we seen parents  <br/>
being INCREDIBLY rude in telling their kids not to BE rude?). But I&#39;d  <br/>
say, &quot;Honey, that wasn&#39;t polite, it is bothering other customers.&quot;  <br/>
And if a child kept it up, I&#39;d take him/her outside to run around a bit.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not suggesting that parents do the &quot;Go tell Mrs. Brown thank  <br/>
you,&quot; routine so much as giving information such as &quot;Mrs. Brown would  <br/>
probably like it if you thanked her.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And even with much older kids, there are times they just don&#39;t think/ <br/>
realize what effect they might be having on others. So it isn&#39;t  <br/>
often, but occasionally I might STILL say, &quot;So-and-so went to a lot  <br/>
of work for you, did you thank her enough?&quot;  And I might point out to  <br/>
them how other people&#39;s lack of manners impacts how people respond to  <br/>
them - point out how people are more eager to do things for those who  <br/>
show their gratitude, for example.<br/>
<br/>
So - be careful that you&#39;re not misleading your husband into thinking  <br/>
that radical unschooling is so hands off that we withhold information  <br/>
and expect kids to learn ONLY from our modeling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1250300484">Andrea, I have mentioned this quite a few times so I apologize for <br/>
those of you who have read it before but a book that REALLY helped me <br/>
with the rules v. principles was Living Joyfully With Children.  It <br/>
isn&#39;t a very long book either so you could just mark key pages for <br/>
your husband to read or just read it aloud to him at night. You can <br/>
probably get it on half.com for a few bucks!<br/>

<br/>
I absolutely agree with this.  I do know some parents who are polite and<br/>
have children who seem to have no manners at all, now that I think about it.<br/>
You need to take it a bit further and let your children know when they are<br/>
doing something that could be perceived as impolite and help them to learn<br/>
social courtesies.  <br/>
