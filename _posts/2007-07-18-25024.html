<div id="ygrps-yiv-2020245448">Dear Kendrah<br/>
<br/>
I really am not the best person to answer your questions!! ;o)  But<br/>
the first thing that strikes me is, why ever would your daughter make<br/>
any connection between getting kitty and being mean to her brother?  I<br/>
know this does notin any way answer any of your more important<br/>
questions, but it&#39;s just one way out of the immediate dilemma.<br/>

connected to each other. She should be nicer to her<br/>
brother because we&#39;re all happier being nicer to each<br/>
other. The kitten is not a reward for being nice. If<br/>
you&#39;re getting a kitten, do it as a gift given freely,<br/>
not as a reward.<br/>
<br/>
Think about it, would you want her to stop being nice<br/>
to her brother if the kitten disappears. &quot;I no longer<br/>
have a reward for being nice, so I&#39;ll stop being<br/>
nice&quot;.<br/>

Read something by Alfie Kohn - &quot;Unconditional<br/>

wordy for my liking, but he has sound ideas. I don&#39;t<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1174016996">If she were behaving badly to other animals you already have (her <br/>
brother may ACT like an animal occasionally lol but I&#39;m talking <br/>
about the non-human types) then I&#39;d definitely put the kitten on <br/>
hold. Otherwise, I&#39;d want to, as you indicate, get to the root of <br/>
the behavior. Is there a real life connection between kitten and <br/>
sibling? Probably not. If there&#39;s not, how does withholding the <br/>
kitten help her live more peaceably with her brother? It would <br/>
likely change her outward behavior for a time to get her &#39;reward&#39; <br/>
and it would also likely develop a bit of resentment toward sibling <br/>
for delaying her kitten. She doesn&#39;t connect taking money out of the <br/>
budget to being nice to brother. She probably doesn&#39;t even know what <br/>
a &#39;budget&#39; is in much detail. Do you hold your partner to the same <br/>
standard of &quot;I cooked dinner for you so you &quot;should&quot; do this for <br/>
me?&quot; &quot;I bought your favorite cookies at the store even though they <br/>
cost $2.39 per box so you &#39;owe&#39; me?&quot; I doubt it. If you stop and <br/>
think it through when the thought pops up (take a breath, relax, <br/>
recognize the thought, consciously choose your next action) you&#39;ll <br/>
likely recognize that it&#39;s not what you want (you indicate as much) <br/>
and that small pause gives you time to make a conscious choice of <br/>
what you want to do, not the autopilot response that we&#39;ve been <br/>
trained to as a society.<br/>
<br/>
Reconnecting with her is what your heart says is the key to the <br/>
situation. Do that first - maybe make kitten related activities part <br/>
of it - there&#39;s a cat carrier to get, a food dish, maybe a cat bed, <br/>
some climbing toys, other toys and treats, etc. Make it a &#39;date&#39; for <br/>
the two of you while your partner or a friend or someone watches <br/>
sibling.<br/>
<br/>
Something I&#39;ve done at times when my DS is really on my nerves, I&#39;ll <br/>
ask him for a hug &quot;My hug meter is running a little low, can I have <br/>
a hug?&quot; It breaks the cycle and let&#39;s us connect so we can work out <br/>
what&#39;s happening - gives me a chance to breathe and think instead of <br/>
react, reconnects with him, changes the whole dynamic.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1182109626">~~Would getting her the kitten now be a bad<br/>
thing?~~<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think a kitten for a four year old is usually a great idea<br/>
anyway. Especially when she&#39;s already being physical with something<br/>
smaller than her. Now you&#39;ll just have two smaller things to protect.<br/>
Not fun.<br/>
<br/>
BUT, it has nothing to do with punishment. It has everything to do<br/>
with maturity and development. I doubt she&#39;s really ready for a<br/>
kitten. There are lots of ways to meet her need for kitten/cat play<br/>
without adopting one yourself...until she&#39;s ready.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, finding ways to connect with her and be proactive about her<br/>
play so it doesn&#39;t become hurtful is important.<br/>

<br/>
Absolutely it should. BUT are you considering your own needs here too?<br/>
Because a kitten and young children are not a great mix in my book.<br/>
I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll hear other views but I&#39;m saying this as someone raised<br/>
with kittens and five siblings and with four baby kittens in my  house<br/>
right now. My 6y.o. has a very hard time treating them all gently<br/>
enough. While every child is different I am personally very leary of<br/>
wee children and cats being together. That&#39;s just me.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a lot more for you to deal with too, when you&#39;re already trying<br/>
to foster peaceful relationships between siblings.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1702177561">~~It is hard to want to do something for<br/>
somebody without expecting something in return. ~~<br/>
<br/>
I know you&#39;re logically realizing these are two very separate issues,<br/>
but are having emotional reactions here. That&#39;s really normal in our<br/>
growth I think.<br/>
<br/>
This is an opportunity to examine where those feelings are coming<br/>
from. For me, it&#39;s usually some message MY parents sent me and it&#39;s<br/>
helpful to sort them out and see what it&#39;s really about. It&#39;s never<br/>
about my kids....it&#39;s about my own baggage.<br/>
<br/>
An emotional response that dredges up our own raising is pretty<br/>
common.:) I think just writing it down probably helped bring some<br/>
clarity to the issue? Writing it down or talking about it usually<br/>
helps me realize where the issue is really rooted. <br/>
<br/>
It helps me to realize that with friends, nobody should &quot;owe&quot; anybody.<br/>
We just do nice things for each other because life is better that way<br/>
and it makes us feel good. <br/>

<br/>
I also hope you are talking to your daughter and son about ALL of you<br/>
helping to take care of the kitten.<br/>
<br/>
A 4 yo cannot be expected to fully be responsible for a pet and yet<br/>
may want to feel she is in charge -- when she&#39;s in the mood. <br/>
<br/>
And there&#39;s no reason little brother should be left out -- kittens<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1146773315">I think at this point you should be thinking about the kitten. Do you <br/>
really think that your daughter will treat it right if she is being so <br/>
physical with her brother? (You may think she will treat the kitten <br/>
differently- that&#39;s for you to decide) I&#39;m just saying that this goes <br/>
beyond &#39;should her getting something be dependant on her behavior&#39;. <br/>

Check into the cat adoption organizations near you. <br/>
There are lots of cats and kittens waiting to be<br/>
adopted that need affection.  You and DD could go<br/>
&quot;volunteer&quot; to spend time with some lonely cats rather<br/>
than bringing one home until she is a bit older.<br/>

<br/>
All kittens need a lot of play time. (Same with puppies.) We&#39;ve found  <br/>
it best to get two kittens. (Not necessarily the answer you were  <br/>
looking for ;-) *Some* kittens, depending on personality, will demand  <br/>
interaction with people.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been volunteering at an animal shelter for the past 5 years and  <br/>
we&#39;d never get a kitten again. The main reason being is that you  <br/>
don&#39;t know what personality the cat the kitten will develop into will  <br/>
have. With cats you know what you&#39;re getting.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s helpful not to picture cats at shelters as being there because  <br/>
they&#39;re unpleasant and no one wants them. 80% of the cats we&#39;ve met  <br/>
at the shelter have been wonderful animals. All have their own  <br/>
personalities: some like to do little more than lay in the sun, some  <br/>
are kitten-like even as adults, some will wrap their arms around you  <br/>
and let you carry them anywhere, some have purr fests as soon as you  <br/>
touch them. Just a wide range of personalities that it&#39;s impossible  <br/>
to know in a kitten. If you make friends with the shelter people,  <br/>
they&#39;ll love to tell you about their favorites :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2035069337">One great thing about getting a cat is that you know what kind of <br/>
animal you are adopting much more so than with a kitten. And they are <br/>
more hardy to escape your toddler :-). Shelters are full of 1 year <br/>
old cats that people got rid of when they stopped being kittens. A <br/>
good shelter will know which particular cats are very easy going and <br/>
gentle and would be best suited to your young family. A kitten is a <br/>
real unknown as  many grow up to be intolerant of kids even when kids <br/>
live with them from the beginning. I grew up in an informal animal <br/>
shelter and knew many kittens who became quite nasty to kids when <br/>
they grew up even though we were always kind and gentle with them.<br/>

<br/>
Be kind to yourself and the cat and wait until your life is settled <br/>
out a bit before you get a kitten.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t sound like you need to add cleaning food and water bowls, <br/>
cleaning litter pans, cleaning up barfy or potty accidents and <br/>
cleaning up cat hair to your already busy schedule. <br/>
<br/>
Moving with pets makes moving even trickier than it already is. <br/>
Moving is stressful on most pets.  If your husbands potential job <br/>
transfer takes you to another place would you be renting or buying?  <br/>
Pet deposits on rentals can be expensive.  <br/>
<br/>
Let things settle a bit. <br/>
<br/>
But you could spend some nice time with your daughter looking at <br/>
pictures of cats and kittens and talking about what kind she&#39;d like <br/>
to have and just fill her up with kitten pretend play and stories and <br/>
fun until your life is more ready for the reality of a new and busy <br/>
kitten around the house.<br/>

Not all cats do that. I have two that do not. They just put up with my toddler and I have to go save them. I also have one that will just scratch and lightly bite my toddler.<br/>
All them were raised with kids but my (now 5 year old) DS was very gentle. Its my 17 mo DD that drags them by the neck and they let her ( well Nene does not).<br/>
So I have to be there at all times to facilitate.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1372239045">i only read the first few replies to the thread...<br/>
<br/>
i also have that thinking going that that they will think that the &quot;reward&quot; will make them think the bad behavior is what is being rewarded... my husband helps me get through those &quot;thoughts&quot;... i have found that the act of kindness will spill over on the kids. so if zoe is being extra grumpy or mean and i give her a &quot;gift&quot; of extra time or i&#39;ll pull out a craft( her favorite activity) she will get happy and be nice to tommy or get over her grumpiness... also i look at her diet. if she has been fed by my parents, that you usually puts both kids in a bad mood. they dont read labels and buy just about everything with HFCS and PHO... so the kids get wacky. <br/>
<br/>
i think the kids dont have that thinking about &quot;rewards&quot;. its something that grown-ups put in their head.<br/>
<br/>
now about the kitten...<br/>
<br/>
we first got two sphynx kittens when zoe was 2. we bought from a bad breeder and they both died within the month. about 4 days after getting the two kittens we got another sphynx from a non breeder. (we were going to start a cattery).. so we were left with one kitten. zoe LOVED her. there was a fair amount of not playing gentle, but the sphynx breed is very kind. we had tommy shortly after. tommy grew up with a cat. the cat got pregnant... she made a hole in the screen and got out. we had four kittens. two went to a friend and two stayed with us. while the kittens were getting old enough to move to their new home with 3 girls, the kids &quot;broke them in&quot;. they were the best kitties we have ever had. i had 6 cats in ohio before having kids... my parents moved in and my dad hates cats... the kitties mysteriously disappeared... one by one...<br/>
<br/>
the two kittens that my friend took, one got pregnant. now we have two of her kittens. one was a hairless like their grandma and one fluffy like their mommy. the cats are great for the kids. there is a lot less fighting over the past year. each has their own kitty, and the kitties know who&#39;s kitty their are... tommy got the hairless and zoe got the fluffy one. the kids play together a lot more now. the have a common like that they can share. since tommy is 2 yrs younger, they had a hard time finding things they can play together. or things that tommy wouldn&#39;t mess up. <br/>
<br/>
i have to say that the cats have been an amazing addition to our family. <br/>
<br/>
if you can, try to find a sphynx... they are expensive, but you can find ones that are not from the show quality breeders. also, you can find an f1, f2, f3, or f4 kitten from an out breeding program that is coated... like one of ours... those sell for super cheap as they have hair, but they still have that great sphynx personality. they are little dogs, trapped in a cat. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1992788905">I realize  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; through email when I&#39;m only asking for advice with one aspect of our  <br/>
&gt; lives it has painted a picture of my daughter that is not entirely  <br/>
&gt; accurate. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I hope you didn&#39;t take what I said wrong. My DD is also very sweet and <br/>
kind. But she is a kid. She accidently hits, kicks or headbutts me all <br/>
the time. We got a kitten at age 2. Here a year later I really regret <br/>
it. She is just too rough with him, just like she is with me. Just <br/>
tonight I was having to explain once again that when the cat is yowling <br/>
he is not happy and she needs to stop doing what she is doing. (as in <br/>
pulling his tail) I often feel like I have to defend the poor cat. <br/>
Also, he is not the nicest cat, and I think that is partly because he <br/>
has not been handled gently. <br/>
   I was also trying to get you to think about the cat. Of course no <br/>
one wants to see your DD hurt, and no one wants to see a cat hurt <br/>
either, but it kind of goes beyond that even.  Quite honestly the cat <br/>
probably can&#39;t kill her. While if she is too rough with the cat she <br/>
could actaully kill him. Not intentionally of course! But I have seen <br/>
my DD do some things that if we let her continue, could have easily <br/>
killed the cat. <br/>
   One other thing I don&#39;t think has been mentioned is you have another <br/>
child to think about too. WHat about your son, and him getting hurt or <br/>
hurting the cat? Several people are saying that 4 is too young for a <br/>
kitten, what about your 1 1/2 y.o.? Your DD and if she thinks she is <br/>
being rewarded for bad behavior is just a small part of this decision. <br/>
   Anyway, for me, if I had a do over, I would not have gotten a kitten <br/>
at the point we did, and probably would not now either. Of course the <br/>
right age would depend on each individual child, <br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s really a personality thing, with cats. I got a cat eighteen <br/>
years ago from a shelter who just died recently. She only ever peed <br/>
on the floor if I had been lax about cleaning the catbox. Pretty <br/>
clear communication on her part! My gf otoh, has a cat she raised <br/>
from a kitten who poos on her bed whenever he gets stressed. Its <br/>
such a common occurance since her dd was born that she never leaves <br/>
her bed unmade or without a special bedspread. Eeeew.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; for it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s an excellent idea. Many shelters have programs to match pets <br/>
with families - it saves on returns :( My aunty is part of a kitty <br/>
rehab program, where she takes in cats who have been thrown out <br/>
rather than brought to a shelter and are a bit stressed-out as a <br/>
result. She keeps them until they are ready to go to a home. <br/>
Naturally she can then give lots of useful information about the <br/>
cats&#39; personalities and temperaments and quirks. <br/>
<br/>
People often get rid of animals for reasons that seem strange or <br/>
cruel - my mom took my brother&#39;s dog to the shelter when he went to <br/>
college! Its by no means the case that animals in shelters are <br/>
somehow defective. Often its more a case of the human in question <br/>
finding himself in over his head as far as animal care.<br/>
