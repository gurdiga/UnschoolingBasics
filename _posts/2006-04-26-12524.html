<div id="ygrps-yiv-932872055">Hello and welcome...my best suggestion is to sit back and read some <br/>
of the threads here. There&#39;s a lot of information there written by <br/>
people who have &quot;been there, done that&quot;. Look for posts by Ren, <br/>
Kelly and Mary. <br/>
My other suggestion is a little bit harder but it&#39;s something I <br/>
realised very early in our unschooling journey. <br/>
It has to start with you. What I mean it, changing the way you look <br/>
at education, learning and school will have to start with you. <br/>
Welcome again....I hope you enjoy it here as much as I do. :-)<br/>

  After going to a public school my entire life, and sending my kids this long how long does it take to get over the mentality of test scores meaning something? I&#39;m not saying test scores are the most important things in life, I understand they&#39;re not. I&#39;m much happier when my children learn something on their own or by asking questions but I come from a family full of teachers who stress test scores all the time. <br/>

  The travel yes is one thing that concerns me. My main concern though is the school itself. I went there and have a nephew who recently left and things go on there I&#39;m not prepared for my child to learn. So many 12 and 13 year olds pregnant. I know my daughter is not going to be young forever and at some point will have to learn about these things but I would rather be the one to teach her and when she has questions now I answer them honestly. I just want her to mature at her own rate and not because she is thrown into a place where she has to grow up so quickly.<br/>

  Thank you for the reading suggestions. I will definitely check it all out.<br/>

Hi Daneyl,<br/>
<br/>
A great book that I bought a couple of weeks ago and absolutely love<br/>
is &quot;If You Want to Be Rich & Happy, Don&#39;t Go to School?:  Ensuring<br/>
Lifetime Security for Yourself and Your Children&quot;, by Robert T.<br/>
Kiyosaki....AWESOME!  This may be a book to not only help you but your<br/>
family of teachers, this isn&#39;t a book about homeschooling, its a book<br/>
at how messed up the grading/competition is in schools and how<br/>
damaging it is to those who cannot meet the standards and also how<br/>
damaging it can be to those who do and everyone in between.  The book<br/>
is an eye-opener in a big way.<br/>

stress test scores all the time. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
**********<br/>
 <br/>
Perhaps doing some reading about Howard Gardner&#39;s multiple intelligences  <br/>
would help.  Test scores only measure a very limited part of our whole  <br/>
intelligence.  I found the book &quot;In Their Own Way&quot; by Thomas Armstrong a  good <br/>
introduction to this.<br/>
 <br/>
Some of the most well-paid people in America are sports stars.  They  have a <br/>
body intelligence most of us do not, standardized tests might tell these  <br/>
people that they are dumb.  Someone else might be *gifted* to work with  elderly <br/>
or people with diminished mental capacity and make an amazing  contribution to <br/>
the world, but still be less intelligence in reading and  math.....basically <br/>
the only two intelligences that are standardized  tested.<br/>
 <br/>
There is a great essay about standardized testing by David  Albert.  It is in <br/>
his book &quot;Homeschooling and the Voyage of  Self-Discovery&quot;.   It is very <br/>
funny; he is taking questions in his  daughter&#39;s test and showing how every <br/>
question could have multiple correct  answers or be completely ridiculous to ask a <br/>
fourth grader.  <br/>
 <br/>
I remember taking a standardized test in sixth grade and getting a taste of  <br/>
&quot;what does this have to do with anything????&quot;  The question asked which  <br/>
military rank was the highest from four choices.  I remember being quite  angry, <br/>
how the hell was I supposed to know?  I knew no one in the military  and my only <br/>
exposure was watching the show m*a*s*h*.  We hadn&#39;t been  studying military <br/>
rank in school, either.  I went home and probably cried  to my mother that I <br/>
shouldn&#39;t be penalized for just not being exposed to  something yet!<br/>
 <br/>
Preparing my ground for unschooling, probably!  :)<br/>
 <br/>
Oh, also read some John Taylor Gatto.  I think particularly in the  <br/>
&quot;Underground History of American Education&quot; he discusses someone&#39;s bright idea  to test <br/>
to manipulate society.  You might be able to find it here <br/>
_<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/chapters/3f.htm_">http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/chapters/3f.htm_</a> (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/chapters/3f.htm)">http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/chapters/3f.htm)</a> <br/>
 <br/>
Have fun letting go of this one!  This was a big leap for me into the  world <br/>
of unschooling.  :)<br/>

As long as you want to hang on to them.  :)  If you are an active<br/>

My oldest went to half a year of school after being majorly relaxed<br/>
homeschooled (we were about to tip over the edge to unschooling) and there<br/>
were pregnant girls in fifth grade.  Lunch discussions were about who was<br/>
still a virgin and who wasn&#39;t.  Many of these girls hadn&#39;t even started<br/>
mensruation yet!  My daughter&#39;s response was, &quot;I just don&#39;t think that these<br/>
girls are mature enough to be making decisions about sex.  They are all so<br/>
ill-informed!&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The general rule of thumb for deschooling, which is what you&#39;ll need to do, is to allow one month for every year you were in school. So it&#39;ll take your kids 6 or so months to decompress and shake off the school-think. For you I&#39;m afraid it will be a longer process since you&#39;ve got your school years plus your kids&#39;!<br/>
<br/>
The more you read and discuss on lists like these though, the easier it will come. We&#39;ll help you to question the answers instead of only answering the questions.<br/>

   After going to a public school my entire life, and sending my kids <br/>
this long<br/>
how long does it take to get over the mentality of test scores meaning<br/>
something? I&#39;m not saying test scores are the most important things in <br/>
life, I<br/>
understand they&#39;re not. I&#39;m much happier when my children learn <br/>
something on<br/>
their own or by asking questions but I come from a family full of <br/>
teachers who<br/>
stress test scores all the time.<br/>
   <br/>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
---------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
The rule of thumb is that it takes one month per year you were <br/>
schooled. If you have a college degree, chances are it will take *you* <br/>
a minimum of 16 months. And you start counting from the *last* time you <br/>
worried about it! &lt;g&gt; Meaning: if you were doing OK  for six months and <br/>
then started nagging your children to pick up workbooks or read <br/>
something, your deschooling has been interrupted. You&#39;ve lost their <br/>
trust. You now have 16 more months to deschool instead of the 10 months <br/>
you had before!<br/>
<br/>
Block out the family views. If you must, block interaction witth them <br/>
until you&#39;re comfortable with your decision---until you believe you <br/>
have deschooled yourself. Don&#39;t let them invade your deschooling.<br/>

<h4>Debi</h4>
<p><small><time> 7 Aug 2007, at 12:53pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1344864082">My name is Debi. I am a mother of 2 great children. Kayla who is 18, <br/>
who just graduated high school and boy was it a struggle. And my son <br/>
Ethan who is 10, who is in 4th grade in public school still. I am <br/>
thinking of taking him out of the elementary school and start home <br/>
schooling him. I have no clue where to start but I have been doing a <br/>
lot of research and unschooling seems to be what would fit us the <br/>
best.<br/>
<br/>
Ethan is a very sensitive child who can not express himself very well <br/>
and had many health problems. He is developmental delayed as he can <br/>
not tie his shoes, ride a bike, his fine motor skills are lacking yet <br/>
but he sure can memorise things to get by in class. I kept him back <br/>
in 3rd grade and he did much better. He was A B honor roll all year. <br/>
But what I find frustrating with public schools is even if they label <br/>
a child with a disability sometimes the teachers still will not work <br/>
with the child.<br/>
<br/>
So this is where I am at, because he used to love learning and now it <br/>
seems he just gets frustrated knowing he has to go back in that <br/>
classroom each day. <br/>
<br/>
Any help or knowledge on how to get started would be a major help for <br/>
me. I have broke it down to 2 different cover schools I am deciding <br/>
to use but from there I am lost.<br/>
<br/>
I do not have much support here. My family thinks I am crazy to do <br/>
this, but I have seen my daughter struggle thru public school just to <br/>
prove them wrong and graduate with a regular diploma ( they wanted <br/>
her to graduate with just a occupational diploma)<br/>
<br/>
Ok I am long winded. I hope to get to know everyone<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again <br/>

Hi, Debi! Nice to meet you! <br/>
 <br/>
to get started, well for me, it took a few things (and I consider myself  <br/>
still in the act of starting, too). <br/>
 <br/>
1. Acknowledging your child&#39;s needs (you got that!)<br/>
2. Knowing options are there (you got that too!)<br/>
3. Having the confidence to trust and be open, so you can continue to  listen <br/>
to your son with more than your ears - so you can say to those naysayers,  <br/>
&quot;Ha! This&#39;ll be great. Just you watch!&quot; ;) (and you WILL have that,  really!)<br/>
 <br/>
Honestly? Keep reading. Here, other lists maybe, books, all the blogs fro  <br/>
the parents here...and let your son just BE for a bit. He may need 4-5 months or <br/>
 longer before he sees his own sense of trust and love of learning return. (I <br/>
 heard an average type number is as many years as they were conventionally  <br/>
schooled, will be as many months as they need to decompress - give or take - <br/>
and  I THINK that&#39;s what I heard, lol!) <br/>
 <br/>
Family members can be told, &quot;I appreciate your concern and I will take that  <br/>
into consideration.&quot; and then be DONE with it. <br/>
 <br/>
This is fun. I&#39;ve never been able to let go and love and enjoy my children  <br/>
in this way before. I was too busy molding them...or so I thought. Now, they  <br/>
help mold me. We are a unit in our individuality. <br/>
 <br/>
Have fun with this new direction your lives are taking. It&#39;s a wonderful  <br/>
ride.<br/>
 <br/>
Karen <br/>

Also make sure you know the LAWS where you are (wherever that is) and <br/>
whether you even need a cover school.<br/>
