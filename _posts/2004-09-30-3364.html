<div id="ygrps-yiv-658299738"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; How do you go about telling a child that it is OK to think about their personal wants as not being selfish, self-centered or such.? And let the child to gradually see that their wants are important too! <br/>

 </span></blockquote>You know, this has been an issue at our house.  I don&#39;t know if our son is just naturally frugal, or doesn&#39;t think he&#39;s worth it.  Because I suspect it&#39;s a low self-worth, I&#39;ve wanted to help him understand that listening to your heart is going to involve wanting things.  When I&#39;ve seen him staring at something that I really think he would use and enjoy, I&#39;ve offered to buy it or order it. (Or take him some place I really think he&#39;d like to go check out.)  I feel like I&#39;m having to talk him into it, not just try to figure out if it&#39;s really something that he&#39;s really interested in.  Sometimes I&#39;ve pointed out that I just bought myself or his sister xyz, so he doesnt&#39; think he&#39;s getting more than the rest of us.  Actually, I think what is working best around here is to just put the money in his control--allowance, budget, whatever you want to call it.  I try to make sure that both the kids have enough money to afford the stuff they want without having to ask me.  But of course, that&#39;s not going to work if you are talking about a horse!  I doubt my son could afford a classic car no matter how he saved his little bit of allowance.  Deirdre</div>
