<div id="ygrps-yiv-1835832941">Hi! My oldest son turns 6 in November and this will be our first year Officially Unschooling. I Have been trying to figure out ways to meet State requirements and havent yet chosen the accountability organization yet (I have talked to several but to be honest They just keep making me mad as the last group I visited I was chastised in front of the entire group by the speaker when I asked an Unschooling related question). <br/>
What groups do you all belong to? What do you recommend? What is your way of record keeping?</div>

I&#39;m new to all of this as well so I&#39;ll be learning along with you. One of my<br/>
three daughters will be six in January.<br/>

Also, check to make sure that your state requires this for 6 yo&#39;s....the states I have lived in have been 8 years old.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1067371665">That is really important. MD is 5 and PA is 8 so there is a wide range.<br/>
<br/>
I find is easier now that I have found connection with other  <br/>
unschoolers. You will find many who don&#39;t understand. Several will  <br/>
even condemn. Find ways to connect with supportive people.<br/>
<br/>
What state are you in? Can you find a local group to help you navigate  <br/>
the requirements? We can help you navigate the depths of unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2055592984">You&#39;d need to ask a group of unschoolers in your state for<br/>
recommendations - not everyone has the same regulations from state to<br/>
state, country to country. For instance, I&#39;m in CT where we don&#39;t file<br/>
any paperwork at all if our kids have never been in school. No<br/>
&quot;accountability&quot; organization, no portfolios, no tests, no attendance<br/>
records (which is one of the silliest things for homeschoolers I&#39;ve ever<br/>
seen), nothing. When DS turned &quot;school age&quot; we just kept on doing the<br/>
same things we were doing beforehand...nothing changed.<br/>
