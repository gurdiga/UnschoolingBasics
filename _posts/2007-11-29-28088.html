<div id="ygrps-yiv-615720847">unschoolingbasicsFWIW, this holding onto hurts and dredging them back up months and years later is something I see in some of our extended family members.<br/>
<br/>
The inability or unwillingness to let go of, often long forgotten by everyone else, disagreements and snubs (real or perceived) is never a positive thing when it happens in our family. The relatives I am thinking of are mainly old, though, and we often chalk it up to that and agree that it is too late for them to learn healthier habits.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I have noticed is that the person accused of doing the hurtful thing is often, now, a completely different perseon -- not surprising as we are talking about such long periods of time -- and had been going along thinking fences were mended and things were fine until they get slammed in the face with some stored up anger about something they barely remember. <br/>
<br/>
Does your DS want to let go of those hurts? Forgive? Forget? Or stew in them? Or something else, in between?<br/>

My ds can bring up old hurts from way long ago. We talk about it,<br/>
sometimes with solutions in mind (for the next time we see someone),<br/>
sometimes I just listen. <br/>
