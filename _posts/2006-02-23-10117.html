<br/>
Well, my son is on the computer 24/7 pretty much and, as far as I can <br/>
tell, he is pretty darn healthy and has absolutely no problems with <br/>
his eyes.  What I do know is that he knows a lot more about computers <br/>
than I do and has to help me quite often.  He would not have learned <br/>
all that if I had limited his computer time.  He LOVES computers and <br/>
is constantly learning new things that he can do with them.  That <br/>
might be the way he makes his living some day!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1933972788">I am not an unschooling mom yet, and I am curious. With unschooling, and no<br/>
limits on the computer, do you find that he goes through spurts of spending<br/>
all his time on the PC, and then other times when he is doing other stuff?<br/>
Is the other stuff that he is interested in learning mostly learned from the<br/>
PC - researching the internet, etc.?<br/>
<br/>
Even though I am not unschooling yet and I am still trying to learn how it<br/>
can really work, I do not have any specific limits - at least time-based<br/>
limits - on my 7 yo sons when it comes to the XBox and the PC. Because they<br/>
are still in public school and have homework, I do have &quot;rules&quot; about not<br/>
being allowed to play XBox if it&#39;s time for homework. I do give them the<br/>
choice of homework before or after dinner, and if they choose after dinner,<br/>
then they often play XBox before dinner. Then after dinner, no TV or video<br/>
games until the homework is finished. With them being in public school<br/>
still, I see no other way to work this out - if I let them guide themselves,<br/>
their choice would be to never do the homework - of course. The whole<br/>
homework issue is one of the reasons I hate public school - especially for<br/>
kids this young!<br/>
<br/>
My goal this year, preferrably in the first half of this year, is to pull<br/>
them out of ps and start homeschooling of somekind - eclectic, or<br/>
unschooling, or some other level that I find that will work for me. That&#39;s<br/>
why I am trying to learn more here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-937302942">I have girls, and I know that might make my experience different <br/>
from someone who has only boys, but my kids have NEVER asked to play <br/>
on the computer.  When we buy them a new game they will try it out, <br/>
then never go back to it.  It&#39;s the same with their games, they each <br/>
have a game boy, but only played with it the first day, then it has <br/>
just sat untouched.  They do watch quite a bit of TV, but while they <br/>
are watching they are nearly always doing something else at the same <br/>
time, usually art kinds of things, sometimes even reading.  <br/>
I have to cut this short, I&#39;m being called on to put a piggy bank <br/>
back together, they are calling me a pig doctor...I wonder if I <br/>
should be insulted? :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have a 7 1/2 yr old DS and yes, there are spurts in where his <br/>
interests are. A new video game/computer game will usually lead to a <br/>
spike as he dives into that game. Then it levels off. Right now, <br/>
he&#39;s heavily into the Lost in Time Spongebob episodes and figures. <br/>
No different really than an adult&#39;s behavior - we find a new hobby <br/>
or a new type of food (sushi, Thai, whatever) and we put a lot of <br/>
energy into it for a while. Sometimes it remains a priority item and <br/>
sometimes it sinks back a bit into one among many interests. His <br/>
learning is absorbed from everything - printed materials, Internet <br/>
(although he doesn&#39;t do a lot of the navigating, he&#39;ll ask us to <br/>
look up stuff for him or we&#39;ll just go find stuff to match with <br/>
something he&#39;s asked about), talking with us and others - lots of <br/>
questions and discussions.<br/>

I think, as parents, we all go through periods where we question what <br/>
we&#39;re doing and how we&#39;re doing it, regardless of our <br/>
parenting/homeschooling style. You are definitely not alone there! <br/>
<br/>
As for the issues that your friend raised, only your family can decide <br/>
what fits best for them. There are many unschoolers who limit TV and <br/>
computer time, or who help to oversee what types of food are consumed, <br/>
until they feel their children have enough information to make the <br/>
decisions on their own. Their are also many radical unschoolers who <br/>
impose no limits on what their children do or eat, and that works <br/>
perfectly for their families. <br/>
<br/>
One way isn&#39;t necessarily better than the other. The real &quot;point&quot; is <br/>
that each family is doing what is right for their family at that <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1072555936">Hi.  I agree with Carri Ann in that we all doubt ourselves as parents.  I think it is great to have forums to discuss these things & learn from each other.  At the same time we need to take or discard advice as it pertains to our family because as parents we know our children best.  It seems if you try to please everyone...you end up pleasing no one!  Do what FEELS right to you & your family.  Take care!  Tanna<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-681825150">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I am not an unschooling mom yet, and I am curious. With <br/>
unschooling, and no<br/>

stuff?<br/>
Is the other stuff that he is interested in learning mostly learned <br/>

<br/>
With Kevin he spends most of his free time on the computer, it doesn&#39;t <br/>
really go in spurts.  He loves the computer and yes, he learns most of <br/>
what he learns from the computer.  Some of the stuff that he tells us <br/>
is amazing and every time I ask him &quot;Where did you learn that?&quot;, he <br/>
will almost always say that he read it on the computer.  He is always <br/>
looking up stuff that interests him and even reads the news.<br/>
<br/>
Right now we are on a year long RV trip and are doing LOTS of <br/>
interesting things so it is not like he is on the computer ALL the <br/>
time but when we are in the motorhome he is mostly on the computer and <br/>
when we were living in a house, if we were at home just hanging he was <br/>
on his computer.  If I put something out that is just so interesting <br/>
that he can&#39;t pass it up he would join us.  He is an extremely <br/>
interesting, level-headed kid and I absolutely do not worry AT ALL!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-893219995">I have been giving this whole subject a lot of thought in the last <br/>
12 hours.  It is one that pops up a lot with those that don&#39;t really <br/>
understand radical unschooling, that is why this list exists, so we <br/>
can expand our viewpoints and understand radical unschooling better!!<br/>
<br/>
To those that just hear about radical unschooling it might sound a <br/>
little like unparenting.  I remember when Ren first started <br/>
presenting me with the radical unschooling philosophy I would think <br/>
to myself that she was just being a lazy parent.  It wasn&#39;t until I <br/>
saw it put into practice that I realized it is not unparenting, it <br/>
is about letting go of ARBITRARY rules, letting go of controling our <br/>
children.  It is about trusting our children, having a joyful <br/>
relationship with our children, being involved with our children&#39;s <br/>
lives in a very direct way, HELPING our children make their OWN <br/>
choices by being there for them ALL the time.  <br/>
<br/>
I could go on and on!  I pulled this quote off of a website of Robyn <br/>
Posin&#39;s that I think is very good on this subject:  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;*This deep self, our wise and knowing simple animal being, <br/>
when not interfered with -unerringly, instinctively moves us <br/>
toward that which grows and nurtures us.  Just as unfailing, it <br/>
moves us away from all that endangers us on any level.     <br/>
Robyn Posin&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On the subject of food, TV, etc. , limiting our children in <br/>
anything.  When we give that control to our children they learn to <br/>
listen to their bodies and they don&#39;t hoard like they will never <br/>
have that privilege again.  They know that they have control over <br/>
those things and they do that which makes them feel good and <br/>
nurtured.  Just yesterday I asked Kevin if he wanted me to make him <br/>
some coffee (he drinks it every so often) and he said &quot;No, I don&#39;t <br/>
think I am going to drink it anymore because it makes me feel queazy <br/>
and it kind of gives me a stomache ache.&quot;  My kids often turn down <br/>
sweets that other kids would gorge on because they know that if they <br/>
want it later they can have it.  The trick is to make sure that <br/>
healthy stuff is out and easy to grab because they will eat that <br/>
stuff if it is accesssible.  The problem is that most parents don&#39;t <br/>
make the healthy stuff easy to grab and go.  <br/>
<br/>
The same goes with TV, computer, etc.  Make your home interesting <br/>
and fun and then let them choose.  Sometimes they will choose TV or <br/>
computer or games for several days but, most likely, if the world <br/>
around them is interesting they will choose other things too and if <br/>
they don&#39;t it is because it is fulfilling some need they have.  We <br/>
grew up without TV and my kids didn&#39;t have TV until about 4 years <br/>
ago.  When we first got it they watched it 24/7 for about a year.  <br/>
When they realized that it wasn&#39;t going to go away and they could <br/>
watch it whenever they wanted to, they quit watching it 24/7 and <br/>
went on to other intersting things.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, hope that helps a little.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
i&#39;m trying to figure out what unschooling really is, i know the principles<br/>
(i think) but i would like to learn more about what happens in day-to-day<br/>
unschooling life. so far i&#39;ve only read john holt&#39;s &quot;how children learn&quot; and<br/>
i&#39;ve been to a john taylor gatto talk.i&#39;ve also been trying to read<br/>
&quot;unconditional parenting&quot; but haven&#39;t gotten very far. <br/>
<br/>
i&#39;m slowly going through some of the links in the files section to learn<br/>
more... i&#39;ll probably lurk more often than not to kinda learn the ropes. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
i think my biggest concern is my own doubts about the success of<br/>
unschooling. i come from a fairly strict asian community where excellence in<br/>
school is coveted. grades were very important and even now i have to remind<br/>
myself to not compare my child to other children his age. so really my<br/>
problem starts with me :o) i need to break down my own prejudices and<br/>
beliefs and figure out what&#39;s best for our family in the long run!<br/>

Actually, nobody else in our family even homeschools.<br/>
<br/>
Our younger sister works full time and has my niece in preschool. It&#39;s<br/>
sad, but I know that is their choice for right now, so no sense in<br/>
saying anything at this point. She&#39;s a very gentle mama and tries to<br/>
honor Rylee&#39;s choices as much as possible.<br/>
<br/>
We hope she&#39;ll change her mind one day and let Rylee unschool of course.:)<br/>

My adopted sibs should not homeschool their kids! I would encourage<br/>
them not to if they asked. sigh.<br/>
