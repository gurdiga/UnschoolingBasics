When Jon finds a place, we might need to make appointments. Ask him to<br/>
book Sunday night, as I don&#39;t want to be in pain through the entire<br/>
conference.:)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>July 2003.  San Fransisco.  La Leche League Interntaional Conference.  12<br/>
Leaders packed in a limo head to a tattoo parlor where 3 of them get marked<br/>
for life.  The guy thought they were the coolest moms he&#39;d ever met.  :)<br/>
There was even show and tell where others in the group shared their tats and<br/>
piercings.  A fun time was had by all.<br/>

coming with Tristan and I to the conference) said that she wants me <br/>
take full advantage of being there...not feeling bad about going to <br/>
any/all presentations, heading out to dinner with a group, etc.  She&#39;s <br/>
basically attending to hangout with Tristan.   <br/>
<br/>
I could just imagine the look on her face if I told her &quot;Hey, we&#39;re <br/>
all heading out for tattoo night!&quot; LOL  I&#39;ve told her the weekend will <br/>
be busy and FUN...but I don&#39;t think she&#39;d be expecting something like <br/>
that. ;o)<br/>

You might get surprised.  My mom is looking for the &quot;right tattoo.&quot;  She<br/>
knows where she wants it (on the arch of her foot - I personally think it<br/>
would hurt and heal slowly, but it&#39;s her tat, her foot).  She just hasn&#39;t<br/>
found the right one yet.  I already know what 2 tats I&#39;m going to get ......<br/>
eventually.  One is my mom&#39;s signature.  She always signed all her letters<br/>
&quot;OXOX, Mom&quot; The other is a sparrow for my dad.  But these are both &quot;memorial<br/>
tats&quot; and I obviously don&#39;t want them until my parents have passed away (I&#39;m<br/>
hoping I will be a REALLY old fart by then LOL!)  I almost got a hurricane<br/>
tattoo after I made it through Ivan alive, but decided I was going to wait<br/>
and do it for my 40th birthday.  That came around and we were so busy that I<br/>
just never got around to it.  Now I&#39;m thinking that I still want to remember<br/>
that horrible experience in someway, but not sure if a hurricane symbol is<br/>
the right sign.  Maybe I&#39;ll figure that out after this hurricane season LOL!<br/>
