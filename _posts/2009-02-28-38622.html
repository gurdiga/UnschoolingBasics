<div id="ygrps-yiv-1824352653">Good Morning Folks!<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday our family had scheduled an improptu skateboarding day at <br/>
Sammamish Park, WA<br/>
We had a wonderful sunny day at the skateboarding park in Sammamish. <br/>
We met new folks and that was fun. A few people asked in the home-<br/>
schooling boards we subscribe to, if we can do this activity again.. <br/>
YES, WE CAN!!! After making a few calls, this is what we have to <br/>
offer for all homeschoolers / unschoolers. This is not part of any <br/>
group. We are just going to have clean safe fun. <br/>
<br/>
Friday,  March 6th 1-3pm @ Renton Skatebarn $5 per kid. The famous <br/>
Mitchie Brusco (utube him and you will be either amazed or clench <br/>
your teeth with fear!) will be there to skate with us! Skatebarn&#39;s <br/>
address is: 2900 Lind Ave SW<br/>
Renton, WA 98057<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Friday, March 20th 1pm @ Sammamish Skatepark if we have a no rain day <br/>
OR snow!  Sammamish address is: 801 228th Ave SE Sammamish, WA 98075<br/>
