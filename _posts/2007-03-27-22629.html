<br/>
I really don&#39;t think even President Bush cares about whether you<br/>
emailed me offlist or not. You are free to think whatever you like,<br/>
you are NOT however, free to email me whatever you like.<br/>
<br/>
You are not free to come into my home and start evangalizing either.<br/>
Even the President and his cronies would back that. Your email will be<br/>
banned from my mailbox, so apparently it&#39;s not THAT free of a country.<br/>
There are some laws protecting privacy still in place...thank goddess.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-256326954">~~I believe Ms Debra said it best,mam&#39;~~<br/>
<br/>
Yes she did.<br/>
She stated that SHE believes being Christian and gentle<br/>
parenting/unschooling work well together and that discussing religion<br/>
at the list is unecessary. Exactly what we&#39;re all telling you. Deb is<br/>
a very gentle mama that does not advocate a &quot;naughty&quot; chair or the<br/>
other methods you&#39;re defending. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Me too, I joined because the description of the group seemed<br/>
thoughtful and inclusive. I only joined a few weeks ago, maybe not<br/>
even that long, and since the thread about siblings fighting got out<br/>
of hand and turned into the Christian Values rant the tone of the<br/>
discussion is dismal.<br/>
 I personally can see that those who have replied to Georgette have<br/>
been honest and respectful, but I dont see any of that in return. and<br/>
all the upper case writing, thats shouting in computer speak.<br/>
I hope that this will settle down and we can continue with the<br/>
friendly, helpful and willing to learn attitude that was so apparent<br/>
to me when I joined the group.<br/>
Thanks! :) <br/>
