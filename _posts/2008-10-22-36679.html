<br/>
My 2 year old DS doesn&#39;t seem to like young kids.  We went to a Halloween party today and he <br/>
kept guiding me to the door.  So we left.  Maybe the costumes freaked him out.  Who knows.  <br/>
But this &quot;fear&quot; seems to come and go.  We were on a 5 hour flight last month where he <br/>
screamed every time he heard a baby make a sound from the row in front of us.  Unexpected <br/>
sounds seem to scare him.  <br/>
<br/>
That being said, he was fine at the playground yesterday (played ball with other kids) and <br/>
when we&#39;re out and about.  He loves adults and will make eye contact and point and sign to <br/>
them (he&#39;s not very verbal just yet). I know he&#39;s really young and that I need to support him <br/>
when he&#39;s scared but sometimes I feel sad that he doesn&#39;t want to be around other kids.  <br/>
Probably because I usually want to chat with the other moms, who I have a lot in common <br/>
with - and that seems rare around here.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts?  Anyone else have this experience?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, Dina, my son completely avoided playgrounds and groups of young<br/>
kids from 2 years old until he was almost five. I was surprised when I<br/>
realized he found most kids his age too noisy and unpredictable to<br/>
enjoy their company. He preferred playing with me or my husband for<br/>
most of those early years, or with one carefully chosen friend at a<br/>
time. And yet I never really thought of it as a &quot;problem&quot; until I<br/>
started hearing it from other parents and, later on, from school and<br/>
the experts within. <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately for my son, that was the beginning of me eventually<br/>
learning to see him as a big long string of social and learning<br/>
disabilities. &quot;The first warning signs&quot;, some said. To keep a long<br/>
story short, that perspective was not at all helpful for me or my son.<br/>
Thankfully and with the help of this group I am now working on<br/>
reversing that damage, but I spent lot of time trying to figure out<br/>
what was wrong with him instead of accepting and helping him.   <br/>
<br/>
My now 9 year old son still finds many kids are emotionally and<br/>
physically rougher than he likes and often initially avoids new groups<br/>
until he has had a chance to watch them operate, but he has learned to<br/>
expect and plan for this more now.  He likes to play pretend games<br/>
such as Army or Dinosaur Hunters, which can take a rough turn quickly,<br/>
so he generally &quot;runs&quot; these games to keep the action to an acceptable<br/>
level, which takes it own unique set of social skills.  He continues<br/>
to choose his friends very carefully and avoids kids who won&#39;t allow<br/>
for his playing style. It still takes him a long time to judge whether<br/>
a social situation feels safe to jump into or not. He is sometimes the<br/>
leader, sometimes the one sitting out. No problem. Now that we&#39;re out<br/>
of school, that is.<br/>
<br/>
I also choose my friends carefully, spend a lot of time by myself, and<br/>
avoid certain types of people altogether. It drives me crazy when<br/>
someone tells me I should socialize more. Why I was ever sad about my<br/>
son doing the same things probably had more to do with that Kodak<br/>
moment in my head about him than anything real in our lives.<br/>

younger cousin because she pulled my hair.  <br/>
<br/>
A younger child&#39;s differences may upset him. Especially if they tend to <br/>
take his toys, poke his face, or drool in his food.<br/>
