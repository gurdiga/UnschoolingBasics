<div id="ygrps-yiv-1040253728">Something interesting and frustrating has been going on for the last 2<br/>
months with my ds9. It started out with him riding a friend¹s electric<br/>
scooter. He then decided he wanted one. He started browsing online and<br/>
within a week had changed his mind from an electric scooter ($200) to an<br/>
electric riding toy to an electric dirt bike to a gas dirt bike ($2800). We<br/>
have told him that we do not have that quantity of money available for his<br/>
entertainment. We talk about gas usage and cost, clean air, what he might<br/>
have to choose not to do/have in order to free up those funds. He looks at<br/>
our finances with us in Quicken, and then gets all upset because it looks to<br/>
him like we have a lot in savings. We explain that we want 6 mos of living<br/>
expenses and need to replenish the money we just spent on a car and property<br/>
taxes and etc. So they money he sees in the accounts is not available for<br/>
spending. He says we are mean and gets all upset. Over the last 2 months he<br/>
has continues to look for something with a motor for his entertainment. He<br/>
is now stomping and yelling at me when he says things like ³lets buy this<br/>
$15,000 boat² and I say that is unreasonable. I am getting tired of his<br/>
reactions and requests. We have talked about his needs such as he knows what<br/>
they are (fun). He has experience handling money and saved $70 on his own<br/>
for his racing bike last year (a $700 purchase). I have helped him make a<br/>
list of desirable qualities of this vehicle (goes fast), we have talked<br/>
about where he could ride it (basically on the driveway for a dirt bike<br/>
without purchasing a hitch, trailer, and paying fees for a track), I have<br/>
taken him window shopping to sit on the vehicles (they don¹t allow test<br/>
drives). I asked a friend with a motorcycle to give ds a ride, and ds said<br/>
he would think about it (not gotten back to me yet). I think I need help<br/>
seeing a better way of handling this situation. Dh thinks I have been<br/>
stringing ds along because dh does not want to purchase any of these items.<br/>
Oh, and ds has yet to save even $1 for this vehicle which he says is really<br/>
important. Any ideas?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re having problems because he sees you as an obstacle rather than  <br/>
a partner. What you&#39;re doing with your &quot;reasoning&quot; is building a  <br/>
higher and higher wall between him and what he wants. Of course he&#39;s  <br/>
going to get frustrated with you. Of course he&#39;s going to fight it.<br/>
<br/>
If you wanted something -- a piece of cheesecake perhaps -- and  <br/>
someone started giving you tons of reasons why he thinks you  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t want it, would it make you want it less? Or would you feel  <br/>
like saying &quot;screw you?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t logic the want away. You can only make him more mad at you  <br/>
for trying to make it go away.<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t it a *good* quality in adults to see obstacles and want to get  <br/>
them out of the way? Isn&#39;t it not so good for a adults to see an  <br/>
obstacle and give up? Why do we want our children to be different?  <br/>
Why do we expect them to back off of obstacles as children and then  <br/>
become obstacle fighters as adults?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes it is available. I&#39;m not saying you should spend it. What I&#39;m  <br/>
saying is that you&#39;re *choosing* not to spend it. You&#39;re *choosing*  <br/>
to rebuild 6 months of living expenses as a back up. You&#39;re  <br/>
*choosing* your desire over his desire for a dirt bike. He knows  <br/>
you&#39;re lying when you say it&#39;s not available because it is clearly  <br/>
sitting there (and was available to dip into for a car.) He knows  <br/>
you&#39;re *choosing* to not make it available when he wants something.  <br/>
*That&#39;s* why your argument is falling on deaf ears.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We talk about gas usage and cost, clean air, what he might<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s denigrating to someone&#39;s interests to label them entertainment.  <br/>
An interest is an interest. Was Evel Knievel&#39;s interest in  <br/>
motorcycles for his entertainment? He was serious about motorcycles.<br/>
<br/>
Treat your son&#39;s interests with respect. (And, as a bonus, he&#39;ll  <br/>
treat your need to watch a science show when your 105 with respect.  <br/>
He&#39;ll go that extra mile to make sure your aural implants for your  <br/>
non-functioning ears are working and you get to your advanced Lasik  <br/>
surgery because he knows the show is something that delights you and  <br/>
he wants you to be happy. Or would you rather hear all the reasons he  <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to help you?)<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you&#39;ve done a lot of other good things but don&#39;t focus  <br/>
on the no, focus on the positives. &quot;It makes us uncomfortable to  <br/>
spend the cushion. Let&#39;s see what else we can do first.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Have you looked into used? Do you have a church or other group you  <br/>
belong to send out feelers for something someone might have in their  <br/>
garage? How much *can* you afford if it was for something that wasn&#39;t  <br/>
what you label &quot;entertainment&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
You have the opportunity to show him problem solving in action rather  <br/>
than obstacle building. Put the effort into this that you&#39;d put into  <br/>
helping him get something that wasn&#39;t for &quot;entertainment&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
-=-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
Ouch!<br/>
<br/>
How did that make him feel? Not enough money for &quot;his entertainment.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
We talk about gas usage and cost, clean air, what he might<br/>
have to choose not to do/have in order to free up those funds.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And he was willing to sacrifice a little clean air and all the other <br/>
things he does and haves in exchange for the dirt bike, right?<br/>
<br/>
-==-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
He looks at our finances with us in Quicken, and then gets all upset <br/>

him like we have a lot in savings. We explain that we want 6 mos of <br/>

<br/>
You *choose* to have six months of living expenses. You&#39;ve made that <br/>
*choice*. It&#39;s an honorable *choice*. Many people don&#39;t prepare that <br/>
far ahead, so that&#39;s a great goal. But it&#39;s a *choice* you and your <br/>
husband have made.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
=0<br/>
A<br/>
So they money he sees in the accounts is not available for<br/>
spending. He says we are mean and gets all upset.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Unless there&#39;s something really important, right?<br/>
<br/>
What things would be considered important enough to dig into your <br/>
savings?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Over the last 2 months he<br/>
has continues to look for something with a motor for his entertainment.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Could you PLEASE drop the &quot;for his entertainment&quot; part of this??? It&#39;s <br/>
demeaning to him and his wants/passions.<br/>
<br/>
This computer you&#39;re writing on could be considered &quot;for your <br/>
entertainment&quot; too. So could that new book you just bought. &quot;For your <br/>
entertainment&quot; is a perfectly good *reason* to buy things. Really.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Over the last two months, he has continued to look for something with <br/>
a motor&quot; is a fine statement all by itself. Adding the &quot;for his <br/>
entertainment&quot; trivializes it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
He is now stomping and yelling at me when he says things like ³lets buy <br/>
this<br/>
$15,000 boat² and I say that is unreasonable.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Why? Because no one likes boating? Because you live in Kansas? Because <br/>
that&#39;s a year&#39;s mortgage? What&#39;s the reason you&#39;re giving him?<br/>
<br/>
And why is he asking? Does he really want a boat? Or is it to get your <br/>
goat?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I am getting tired of his reactions and requests.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it IS to get your goat.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Can you imagine how tired he&#39;s getting of your reactions and excuses?<br/>
<br/>
-=-==-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
We have talked about his needs such as he knows what<br/>
they are (fun).<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
So...have you all *agreed* that he has a *need* for FUN? And that his <br/>
need for fun not quite as important as your need for six months of <br/>
living expenses.<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that six months of &quot;safe&quot; living shouldn&#39;t include no fun. <br/>
Seriously. What&#39;s a &quot;paid for life&quot; if you can&#39;t have fun? Wouldn&#39;t <br/>
five months with a &quot;cushion&quot; AND a whole lot of fun be better than six <br/>
months of NO fun at all?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I think I need help<br/>
seeing a better way of handling this situation. Dh thinks I have been<br/>
stringing ds along because dh does not want to purchase any of these <br/>
items.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s talk about that a sec:<br/>
<br/>
WHAT?<br/>
<br/>
Would the mindset be different if the child wanted an expensive <br/>
microscope or telescope? (I&#39;m trying to think of &quot;educational&quot; or more <br/>
&quot;grown up&quot; items---something less *fun*.)<br/>
<br/>
Sooo...wait him out so that he&#39;ll quit wanting it? What kind of example <br/>
are you modeling? Not taking others&#39; wants/needs seriously? But your <br/>
son needs to take *your* need to have a six month cushion seriously?<br/>
<br/>
Let me know how that works out! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and ds has yet to save even $1 for this vehicle which he says is <br/>
really<br/>
important. Any ideas?<br/>
0A<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
If you knew there was $5000 in your mattress, would you be trying <br/>
really hard to earn $50? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You know, it may not about actually *getting* the dirt bike. Your <br/>
immediate brakes to his thought process may have taken him by surprise. <br/>
Made him feel less important to you than the mortgage. *IS* he less <br/>
important to you?<br/>
<br/>
Go to dirt bike events. Get to know dirt-bikers. Show up weekend after <br/>
weekend. Become a part of the &quot;gang.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Subscribe to dirt bike magazines, buy shirts with dirt bikes on them, <br/>
find dirt bike videos to watch on Youtube.<br/>
<br/>
Fill his world with all the dirt bikes you can without actually buying <br/>
one right now. But agree to put aside so much $$ each week/month for a <br/>
used bike. Work WITH him to help him meet his passion. Maybe suggest <br/>
that the money you normally spend on movies or ice cream or Starbucks <br/>
could be put aside for the bike. If *everyone* of you sacrificed just a <br/>
little, maybe it *will* become affordable. Let him see you working WITH <br/>
him rather than shutting him down.<br/>
<br/>
We ALL love to help others in our sport---especially newbies. After the <br/>
second or third event, I&#39;d bet someone would offer him a ride. After <br/>
the eighth or tenth, someone may say, &quot;You know, I have pretty old dirt <br/>
bike in the garage. It needs some work, but if you&#39;re willing to help <br/>
me fix that carburetor....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion is to quit shutting him down. NOW.<br/>
0A<br/>
I&#39;m NOT saying that you have to go right out and spend $3000 on a dirt <br/>
bike. *We* couldn&#39;t do that. (Not after the $7000 we just spent to send <br/>
our son to the Yukon for four weeks!) But it&#39;s important to take their <br/>
wants and needs seriously. As seriously as we want them to take OUR <br/>
wants and needs.<br/>
<br/>
PLEASE stop looking at it as &quot;just entertainment&quot;---it&#39;s NOT: it&#39;s <br/>
physics and chemistry and algebra and geometry and finances and history <br/>
and, and, and---and all that wrapped up in a really cool dirt bike.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1541920478">Put that way, it seems a small thing to at least entertain a child&#39;s<br/>
interests, not a huge enormous difficult decision.  I wanted to play the<br/>
violin when I was around 10, and the reason it didn&#39;t happen is because<br/>
since I was already taking piano lessons (which wasn&#39;t my pick) and didn&#39;t<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-809744398">I hear your suggestions (and am very glad for them) and would love to be<br/>
able to followup on them. Ds seems a tad unwilling or uninterested in them<br/>
though. Just this morning he asked if we could have a talk about boats. I<br/>
said yes, would he like us to head down the street to our neighbor who has a<br/>
boat and ask to go out with him next time. He said no. I asked if he would<br/>
like to find someplace to go white water rafting (which he saw on tv<br/>
yesterday) he said no. He wanted to talk about the cost of buying a boat and<br/>
how long it would take us before we could get one. It seems his focus is on<br/>
planning/purchasing/owning one... So we will talk and find out about costs<br/>
of different boats and gas and whatnot associated with boats (when he is<br/>
ready ­ he is playing on the xbox now). Maybe his interest is in the money<br/>
side of it and not in the boats/bikes/etc themselves. He raced his road<br/>
bicycle this morning and really enjoyed that and hanging out with the older<br/>
riders.<br/>
Still not sure what direction to head with him ...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It occurred to me, reading this, that interest in &quot;the money side&quot; <br/>
is what you modelled to him. On some level, he may be reading that <br/>
as a value you have - and kids *do* look to their parents for <br/>
values. The downside is that we, parents, give terribly mixed <br/>
messages about those values. So when you jumped to cost analysis as <br/>
a way of explaining something to him, he heard: &quot;money is very <br/>
important, think about the money&quot;. If checking on the money side of <br/>
things is something you do regularly, that reinforces the &quot;message&quot;. <br/>
Which might not have been the message you were hoping to convey, at <br/>
all. <br/>
<br/>
Remember the old saying &quot;do as I say, not as I do&quot;? Its one *I* like <br/>
to keep in mind. Our actions communicate a whole lot to our kids <br/>
unintentionally, so its important to look at what we&#39;re doing and <br/>
try to see ourselves from the outside - from the Kid side of things. <br/>
<br/>
Someone mentioned talking about money in terms of comfort and <br/>
security - that&#39;s a good idea for clarifying some of your internal <br/>
processes to your ds. It might also be helpful to verbalize some of <br/>
your everyday decision making more so that your ds can see what some <br/>
of that looks like. Even simple things like &quot;oh, this soup is more <br/>
nutritious than the generic even though it cost more&quot; shows him <br/>
something about the ways adults think and make decisions. Its <br/>
possible that part of what he&#39;s doing, flinging all these big &quot;can I <br/>
haves&quot; at you is trying to figure out exactly that - in the same way <br/>
a younger child will use a new word almost at random to try to <br/>
figure out what it means (Mo&#39;s favorite strategy).<br/>

Something interesting and frustrating has been going on for the last 2<br/>
months with my ds9. It started out with him riding a friend¹s electric<br/>
scooter. He then decided he wanted one. He started browsing online and<br/>
within a week had changed his mind from an electric scooter ($200) to an<br/>
electric riding toy to an electric dirt bike to a gas dirt bike ($2800). We<br/>
have told him that we do not have that quantity of money available for his<br/>
entertainment. We talk about gas usage and cost, clean air, what he might<br/>
have to choose not to do/have in order to free up those funds. He looks at<br/>
our finances with us in Quicken, and then gets all upset because it looks to<br/>
him like we have a lot in savings. We explain that we want 6 mos of living<br/>
expenses and need to replenish the money we just spent on a car and property<br/>
taxes and etc. So they money he sees in the accounts is not available for<br/>
spending. He says we are mean and gets all upset. Over the last 2 months he<br/>
has continues to look for something with a motor for his entertainment. He<br/>
is now stomping and yelling at me when he says things like ³lets buy this<br/>
$15,000 boat² and I say that is unreasonable. I am getting tired of his<br/>
reactions and requests. We have talked about his needs such as he knows what<br/>
they are (fun). He has experience handling money and saved $70 on his own<br/>
for his racing bike last year (a $700 purchase). I have helped him make a<br/>
list of desirable qualities of this vehicle (goes fast), we have talked<br/>
about where he could ride it (basically on the driveway for a dirt bike<br/>
without purchasing a hitch, trailer, and paying fees for a track), I have<br/>
taken him window shopping to sit on the vehicles (they don¹t allow test<br/>
drives). I asked a friend with a motorcycle to give ds a ride, and ds said<br/>
he would think about it (not gotten back to me yet). I think I need help<br/>
seeing a better way of handling this situation. Dh thinks I have been<br/>
stringing ds along because dh does not want to purchase any of these items.<br/>
Oh, and ds has yet to save even $1 for this vehicle which he says is really<br/>
important. Any ideas?<br/>

One of the amazing parts of unschooling for me has been the ability to<br/>
support our children&#39;s interests.  Like you, our family likes to have<br/>
a savings, and we also really work hard to help the kids get what they<br/>
need.  In my case, I&#39;m learning (and continuing to learn) that the<br/>
more I listen to what my kids want, the better I&#39;m able to help them<br/>
get it.<br/>
<br/>
From your posts, it sounds like you are wanting to know which<br/>
direction to head.  My suggestion is not to worry so much about the<br/>
destination, but rather listen to what your son wants.  Why he wants<br/>
it.  And then brainstorm how to help him.  If your son wants a boat,<br/>
what are the possibilities?  For example, can he lease one for a month<br/>
to try it out?  How can he/you cover expenses? etc.<br/>
<br/>
With unschooling, anything is possible.<br/>
