 <br/>
Seth (11) has been watching the Mummy and Mummy returns over and over and<br/>
over the last few months.  Of course he goes on to other things as kids will<br/>
but it is like an obsession with him...(not complaining)...I have seen the<br/>
Mummy but the Mummy Returns is not something I was interested in watching<br/>
but my dh has seen it and said there weren&#39;t parts he would think Seth would<br/>
hyper focus on and get scared or freaked out (that is pretty much our<br/>
guideline in his movie selections).  ANYWAY, generally when it comes to<br/>
movies I don&#39;t want to see (or have seen and don&#39;t wanna watch over again) I<br/>
just let him do his thing w/o feeling like I need to be in the room.  I<br/>
walked by a minute ago and he was looking through the bonus features on the<br/>
DVD of the Mummy and it is like an Egyptian history lesson!  It is called<br/>
Egyptology 101...it goes through some of the gods, artifacts, immortals,<br/>
plagues, a map of Egypt...I mean really neat stuff.  He said that on the<br/>
Mummy Returns there is even more stuff!  now I am not any more interested in<br/>
seeing the movies but I DO want to see those bonus features!  How cool is<br/>
that?  he has always been interested in that stuff but who&#39;da thunk he would<br/>
find some of that info on bonus features of a DVD?  <br/>
 <br/>
Just had to share...lol<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-346094827">Tristan (9) loves both of these movies!  Before unschooling he was begging me to see them, but I didn&#39;t want to allow it since they were &quot;PG-13.&quot;  He even went so far as to READ the novelizations.  One of the first things I did when I pulled him out of school was allow him to see them (I just went ahead and bought them since I knew they would be favorites of his)...it was like Christmas had come early. LOL<br/>
<br/>
The bonus features are really cool, aren&#39;t they?  Tristan spent so much time looking through the various sections.  There are times when I&#39;ve bought a movie more for its bonus features than anything else.  Another favorite here when it comes to bonus material is &quot;National Treasure&quot; with Nicholas Cage.  It has a section dealing with cryptography (and deciphering hieroglyphics, I believe).<br/>
