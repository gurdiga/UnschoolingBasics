<div id="ygrps-yiv-1753874753"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><html><font SIZE="2" FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial">Hello all, my name is Nancy and I live in Prince George , BC, Canada. I am 40(GAK) and my dh Ken is almost 43. Our ds Tommy is 8.5 and has never been to school. He loves to ride his bike, jump on the trampoline, invent things, watch movies(right now is watching The Blob with Steve McQueen) and go swimming.<br>
Dd Lesley Ann is 2.5 and very busy. Usually found nude with ice cream on her face, jumping on the trampoline, in the sandbox or checking the three elderly chickens for eggs.<br>
We live on 2 acres about 25 mins out of town, in&nbsp;&nbsp; a log house with 2 cats and one senile Schipperke. We have two horses, and the aforementioned chickens.<br>
I will try not to get too chatty on the list, but am very isolated from like-minded individuals. I try to only lurk on Unschooling Discussion, because I really am not so sure I know what I am doing. So glad to come to this list. Thanks for starting it up.<br>
Tried to post a pic, but not sure where it went. <br>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-596864126">I am Wendy, mom to two 3-yo&#39;s Penny & Emma.  I am new to homeschooling<br/>
in general (that is, keeping my kids out of schools), as well as<br/>
unschooling.  I had an easier time coming to unschooling than my<br/>
husband did, esp. where it touches the rest of our lives.  I know my<br/>
kids are too young for me to even worry about reporting, yet, but the<br/>
time felt right, to us, to consider schooling or not.  We are living<br/>
in an area where we are already getting questions about what<br/>
preschools we are looking at, and so forth.  <br/>
<br/>
I came to unschooling by way of earning a teaching credential.  I<br/>
spent about 3 semesters teaching in CA schools, and completed most of<br/>
the work for my credential. I just couldn&#39;t bring myself to commit to<br/>
teaching, now that I knew what it was like in the classroom. <br/>
Generally speaking, I consider my teaching experience a positive one<br/>
-- I didn&#39;t have many Problem Kids, but that is probably my own<br/>
personality and world view coming into play, to be honest.  I was<br/>
creative, I did everything I could for my students, and I know that<br/>
most of them appreciated my efforts.  More of them cried on my last<br/>
day than I ever expected, and I went home wondering if I&#39;d made a<br/>
mistake in walking away, after all.  Still, after only a year and a<br/>
half, I was burnt out, emotionally.<br/>
<br/>
The last credential class, one in assessment, took me 3 years to<br/>
finish, and ultimately led me to decide to keep my own kids out of the<br/>
System.  I tried to finish the work even after I had left my teaching<br/>
position.  I missed the students.  But over the course of trying<br/>
several times to do the coursework, I detoured several times, looking<br/>
for ways I could reconcile Teaching with The Rest Of My Life.  I<br/>
detoured, investigating Montessori Method.  Some of the course<br/>
readings were actually from Alfie Kohn!  These readings were utimately<br/>
what led me to decide against going back to teaching.  <br/>
<br/>
Okay, I am rambling, now.  <br/>
