<div id="ygrps-yiv-1855951346">&quot;I feel awful<br/>
whenever one of the kids comes up and asks if they can do this or<br/>
that. Or have this or that. We&#39;re still deschooling, altho i can&#39;t<br/>
really blame schooling for that, it&#39;s all me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not always a bad thing...though I understand wanting to undo<br/>
the control issues!<br/>
My kids ask about whether or not they can do things...it&#39;s more about<br/>
watching out for each other and checking in so we know what other<br/>
people are planning at the moment.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-764108735">That&#39;s what we&#39;re working on...that balance between watching out/ <br/>
respecting each other, and requiring permission. With the food, it&#39;s   <br/>
always been an issue between my husband and me &lt;blush&gt; because he&#39;s  <br/>
the kind to eat everything (in his family, eat it because it two  <br/>
minutes it&#39;ll all be gone), while I like to take my favorite snacks  <br/>
and spread it out....or he would use all the eggs when I planned to  <br/>
make a cake. So I think the kids grew up hearing *that*, and between  <br/>
that and my seeming &quot;need&quot; to control diets, it just got out of control.<br/>
<br/>
And the whole choosing what to do, we had such a strict schedule for  <br/>
so long, and it was easier to just not get involved in something that  <br/>
would take a long time rather than try to pull away a screaming child  <br/>
who wasn&#39;t ready to quit, kwim? So...they&#39;re still learning to trust  <br/>
me, and to know that I won&#39;t change my mind. It&#39;ll happen, right?<br/>
<br/>
:-)  I think I heard of the group CA...controllers anonymous? Don&#39;t  <br/>
they meet here? LOL!<br/>

Yes, it really will. Try really hard not to backpedal and that trust<br/>
will blossom beautifully.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Yep. There&#39;s a few former controllers here, and a lot of folks trying<br/>
to let go....you&#39;re in good company.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, but we usually don&#39;t stay anonymous for long. ;-) <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had plenty of control issues to get over with my husband, my kids and even myself. It&#39;s a journey. And yes, they will come to trust that you won&#39;t change your mind as long as they get enough practice. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-62805301">Our kids are the same ....... its really out of respect for other members of <br/>
the house.  They like to know what everyone else is doing or going to do. I <br/>
think its because they want to make sure nobody is going to do something <br/>
&quot;more fun&quot; than their ideas.  Or to see if someone else wants to join them.<br/>
<br/>
My kids even holler to me when they are going to the bathroom, (Mom, I&#39;m <br/>
using the bathroooooooom ! ).<br/>

all over the house this morning (I was in the laundry room.....a first!  &lt;g&gt;).  <br/>
I asked what he needed and he said &quot;I love you&quot; and went to  his room to <br/>

Asking permission reminds me of the movie, Mean Girls.  Yes, I am 36  and <br/>
love those teen movies..lol.  It&#39;s about a girl who was homeschooled in  Africa <br/>
and moves to the US and goes to public high school.  Her first day  of class <br/>
she just gets up and starts heading to the bathroom and the teacher  read her <br/>
the riot act. It just cracked me up because even at home my sons  still ask <br/>
permission to go to the bathroom.  I just smile at them and say  just go..you <br/>
aren&#39;t in school anymore.<br/>

*I* think it&#39;s following the behavior that&#39;s been modelled FOR them.<br/>

I will often ask them these things, so they do the same for me.<br/>

some days a no monster.. my first reaction to everything for the longest time <br/>
was NO  its a slow road to break this habit but everyday it gets better.  Its <br/>
funny if they just do something like paint or chalk the wood shed I have no <br/>
problem I think wow that was creative  but if they come to me and say mom can we <br/>
chalk on the shed my first reaction is NO you cant chalk on the shed <br/>
(incredulous sounds here).  Same with really artsy crafty things if they just drag it <br/>
out I find myself doing it with them and we have a blast if they ask I think <br/>
what  a chore getting it out and cleaning it up will be...  So now they ask and <br/>
if I say no  my 6yr old will say mom is that a real no and I laugh and we do <br/>
the task!  So we are working on the permission/no monster that lives in our <br/>
home!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-388167624">Yeah, I guess that is more what my son does - we have a lot of stuff that<br/>
isn&#39;t readily available and some things that he can only play in special<br/>
areas like the kitchen because it has small pieces and we can&#39;t risk him<br/>
loosing one and his one year old sister trying to swallow it. Other make<br/>
great wonderful messes that while I wish he could do anytime - ten minutes<br/>
before we are walking out the door or while dinner is being made. Other<br/>
times he asks because he wants to play a game he needs help with because he<br/>
finds it fun but he doesn&#39;t have all the knowledge to make it easy. Of<br/>
course, by it gets easy - he will move on to something else - like me - he<br/>
loves a challenge.<br/>
