<div id="ygrps-yiv-213832795">Hello all! <br/>
<br/>
I have been inactive on this list for quite some time, though it was one of my lifelines when we began our unschooling journey in 2007.  At that time we lived in Wyoming where I only knew one other unschooling family who had 2 boys, older than our girls (who are now 6 and 9.5).<br/>
<br/>
We have been attending the Life is Good conference for the past 5 years, during which time we moved to Portland, OR.  In the past we&#39;ve hosted funshops and circle chats and been on panels, but his year I&#39;m going to be a speaker.  I&#39;m very excited, and have some things I want to talk about, but I wanted to pick the brains of the folks here.  <br/>
<br/>
Are there any topics/specific questions/things you wish you knew at the very beginning of your unschooling journey?  Things that could have helped you jump into unschooling?  Questions you still have?  A &quot;best piece&quot; of advice someone gave you?  (Or on the other hand, something someone suggested that you try that bombed big time?  :)  )<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to reply here, or email me off list.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!  Carolyn Winkler (wahoowinklers.blogpost.com -- haven&#39;t updated in a while!)<br/>
