<div id="ygrps-yiv-204748890">Hi all,<br/>
  Ok, Just when I thought I had this all figured out and was secure <br/>
in what we are doing as far as radical unschooling I find myself very <br/>
insecure and now, after reading a post from the other unschooling <br/>
list mentioned, its even worse!<br/>
  1st off is the TV.  I don&#39;t monitor it at all, but we don&#39;t have <br/>
cable so its not like there is too much my boyz can&#39;t watch.  BUT, <br/>
the thing is on constantly.  Its as if my oldest cannot funtion <br/>
without hearing or seeing it!  Even if it is to put on a pair of <br/>
shoes, he goes right to the tv to sit down and do it.  Am I don&#39;t <br/>
wrong leaving it on all the time?  Myself, I like to listen to it, so <br/>
I have been assuming that is what my kids are doing too.  I guess I <br/>
am just second guessing myself again.  <br/>
  I need to get back to reading this list everyday, when I do, It is <br/>
so much easier to keep things in perspective!<br/>
  Ok, 2nd, on the other list, which I found to have some great things <br/>
to read, someone mentioned that she doesn&#39;t just leave her kids to <br/>
themselves.  But my boys seem to be so busy during the day, that they <br/>
usually don&#39;t have time for mom!  So I&#39;ve just been letting them do <br/>
their thing, as this is when they seem their happiest and most <br/>
content.  The youngest loves to read before bed, but so far that is <br/>
ALL he wants to do with mom.  The comment I read from that list that <br/>
got me thinking was, she doesn&#39;t just let the kids play vidio games <br/>
and watch tv and play all day.  OH my , this is exactly what my kids <br/>
are doing!  <br/>
  I do take them  to the library , when I can get them to, never <br/>
forcing it.  I let them pick out their own books, but don&#39;t stress <br/>
over weather or not they read them.  We go to the park, weather and <br/>
asthma permitting, they go outdoors, and I do &quot;strew&quot; things about, <br/>
but most times its ignored.  <br/>
  Should I be doing anything any different?  I think my own schooling <br/>
is trying to creep back into my head, I don&#39;t know, I just all the <br/>
sudden have all these doubts!<br/>
  Thanks for listening<br/>

Should I  be doing anything any different?  I think my own schooling <br/>
is trying  to creep back into my head, I don&#39;t know, I just all the <br/>
sudden have all  these doubts!&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
When I hear people talking about doubts, it is usually, like you  suggested, <br/>
that they are listening to other people instead of their  children.  I <br/>
encourage them to arm themselves with good information and  find out why they are <br/>
having the doubts exactly.  What are they afraid  of?  <br/>
 <br/>
Are you afraid that these other children, with mom&#39;s that won&#39;t let them  <br/>
watch TV all day, will be ahead of your children, happier than your children,  <br/>
more connected to family than your children?  What is it exactly?   Once you <br/>
define the origin of your fear it is easier to regroup.  Try  getting rid of all <br/>
that self-talk going on in your head that you learned from  society, from your <br/>
family or from years of schooling.  Start replacing that  with things like <br/>
&quot;my children are exactly where they need to be in life&quot;   &quot;they are happy&quot; <br/>
&quot;there is no one to be behind and no one to catch up to, they  are on their own <br/>
path&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
You cannot compare your children to anyone else&#39;s.  They are as  connected to <br/>
you as they need to be.  If you are open and available, they  know that.  <br/>
Maybe that is why they are so secure in not being physically  doing things with <br/>
you all day, they know you are there when they need or want  you.  They are <br/>
spiritually connected.  <br/>
 <br/>
Sometimes I will go up to my boys, who sound a lot like yours in that  they <br/>
are busy with their own interests, and say that I just need a hug. Or I  will <br/>
pass by and whisper in their ear &quot;I love you&quot;.  We also do not need to  be <br/>
doing things with each other all day.  They also see me involved with my  <br/>
interests as well.<br/>
 <br/>
Reread some of you favorite unschooling books, one of mine that I reread is  <br/>
Valerie Fitzenreiter&#39;s The Unprocessed Child.  Read at <br/>
_<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sandradodd.com/unschooling_">http://www.sandradodd.com/unschooling_</a> (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sandradodd.com/unschooling)">http://www.sandradodd.com/unschooling)</a> <br/>
Read real accounts of real Unschoolers.  Information is the key.   Good <br/>
information from Unschoolers that have been unschooling for years.  <br/>
 <br/>
Anyway this is too long for a post from me,<br/>

<br/>
Yikes! The idea on the Unschooling lists is to make people feel better about<br/>
Unschooling, not insecure!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  I need to get back to reading this list everyday, when I do, It is <br/>

I find this exact phenomenon.<br/>

<br/>
Lot&#39;s of &quot;I&#39;s&quot; in the post. How old are your kids? How long have you been<br/>
Unschooling? Are they happy, busy, engaged, open, communicative,<br/>
interesting, healthy, trustworthy and enjoying life? If they are perhaps you<br/>
are doing something right.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1967774868">I don&#39;t THINK I am comparing my kids to anyone else&#39;s. when I do I <br/>
ALWAYS find out how wonderful this lifestyle has come to be.  When I <br/>
worked before and the oldest was in school, most days I couldn&#39;t wait <br/>
to get them to bed, or out the door, or to gr&#39;mas.  Now, its so much <br/>
different, I love being around them, and having them home, and <br/>
sending them to gr&#39;mas is not top priority anymore!<br/>
  I guess what I fear would be the future.  I just finished the <br/>
Unprocessed Child (WONDERFUL BOOK!) I might have to get it out and <br/>
read it again!<br/>
  Now sitting here thinking about all this I realize I am in fact <br/>
comparing my youngest to what the rest of the kids in school are <br/>
doing.  He has no interest in any of it, so like I said, we just read <br/>
for now.  (and read, and read, and READ!)  But it creeps in, they are <br/>
doing math, on worksheets, mine is doing math in his head, without <br/>
instruction.  Oh i could go on and on.  But you see what I mean and <br/>
yes, i can see exactly what you are talking about.  They are where <br/>
they need to be.  <br/>
  I had to throw in the math part for those that are considering or <br/>
are new to unschooling.  My youngest is 6 and it was totally amazing <br/>
to me that he was adding and subtracting without doing worksheet <br/>
after worksheet or any instruction. In fact, it was by accident that <br/>
I found out he was capable of this. Not to mention his vocabulary.  <br/>
Must be all the tv, new words all the time popping out of his little <br/>
head! NOT that I&#39;m comparing him to the kids in school &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
  Ok, gotta get back on track and back to reading.  Thank you both <br/>
for the encouragment.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1115734681">Syndi, <br/>
This may fly in the face of what everyone else thinks<br/>
about unschooling, but I still give my kids limits and<br/>
requirements.  I think every family should do that,<br/>
though the amount and types would be different for<br/>
each family.  <br/>
<br/>
I only let my kids watch TV or videos/DVDs and  play<br/>
on the computer during late afternoon and evening. <br/>
I&#39;m not so rigid that I don&#39;t make exceptions,<br/>
especially for stuff that has to do with what they are<br/>
interested in learning, but it holds true for most the<br/>
time.  <br/>
<br/>
I started out letting them do whatever they wanted,<br/>
but they didn&#39;t do anything but read sometimes.  I<br/>
remembered that as their mother I can parent them,<br/>
which includes guiding and directing their activities.<br/>
 They have freedom in how to learn something and even<br/>
about when to go play for the most part.   <br/>
<br/>
For example, I require my kids to do math every day. <br/>
We have Math-U-See and they can do a page in it or<br/>
flash cards or something else.  But they have to do<br/>
something.  I also make them do math first.  They<br/>
never do when left on their own, but admit it&#39;s okay<br/>
when I make them.  They put up a fuss at first, but<br/>
are very proud of themselves for what they have<br/>
learned.<br/>
<br/>
Forget about schooling or unschooling, if that<br/>
confuses you, but think about your goal.  Mine is to<br/>
help my kids become educated and grow into<br/>
responsible, caring adults.  They won&#39;t do that if I<br/>
leave them to their own devices.  They can&#39;t get the<br/>
education they need watching tv all day (and studies<br/>
have shown it&#39;s not healthy).  And making them happy<br/>
all the time isn&#39;t my job.  They need and want<br/>
guidance.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still &quot;unschooling.&quot;  They choose most of their<br/>
learning experiences and always their education is<br/>
tailored to the way they learn best.  We have no<br/>
lesson plans or checklists or textbooks.  They only<br/>
use workbooks if they want to and then not every page<br/>
or problem must be done, just what they need to learn.<br/>
 They also do a fair amount of helping around the<br/>
house and with the little ones and they don&#39;t have any<br/>
choice about that.  So don&#39;t be afraid to set limits<br/>
or provide more direct guidance.  It&#39;s your job as<br/>
parent.  I hope this helps.  I&#39;ve been where you are. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Christa<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-361988129">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Forget about schooling or unschooling, if that<br/>
confuses you, but think about your goal. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is an Unschooling list. This is not the place to forget about schooling<br/>
or unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I only let my kids watch TV or videos/DVDs and play<br/>
on the computer during late afternoon and evening. <br/>
I&#39;m not so rigid that I don&#39;t make exceptions,<br/>
especially for stuff that has to do with what they are<br/>
interested in learning, but it holds true for most the<br/>
time.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; They have freedom in how to learn something and even<br/>
about when to go play for the most part.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Except for doing math first. Or learning using computer games. Or from<br/>
DVD&#39;s. Or from playing. Or evidently from math in real life.<br/>
<br/>
Some people are morning people. They learn best first thing after awakening.<br/>
Others need to warm up to the day, and are at their most productive in the<br/>
afternoon or evening hours. These time restrictions are arbitrary.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;They never do when left on their own, but admit it&#39;s okay<br/>
when I make them.  They put up a fuss at first, but<br/>
are very proud of themselves for what they have<br/>
learned.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You may believe it&#39;s ok, but it&#39;s not Unschooling. It&#39;s not OK to recommend<br/>
restrictions and enforced teaching or stomping over your children&#39;s feelings<br/>
until they are defeated, on an Unschooling list.<br/>
<br/>
My child is proud of herself too, and she has never been forced to &quot;learn&quot;<br/>
anything. Her pride is in what she has accomplished &quot;academically&quot;, not from<br/>
making her mother happy or approving. Of course I am both of those things.<br/>
Especially since it is all her own ideas and discoveries.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Mine is to<br/>
help my kids become educated and grow into<br/>
responsible, caring adults.  They won&#39;t do that if I<br/>
leave them to their own devices.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One purpose of this list is to help parents trust that their children will<br/>
learn all that need to become caring and responsible adults. It is never<br/>
&quot;leaving them to their own devices&quot; but the opposite. We don&#39;t leave them to<br/>
the tender mercies of some horrible math curriculum either.<br/>
<br/>
Read for longer. Learn how it works before offensively dismissing us as not<br/>
caring if our kids grow up to be caring and responsible. Hopefully you will<br/>
also gain more faith in your children, instead of the amount of critical<br/>
scrutiny they have been subjected to by you in your post.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; They can&#39;t get the<br/>
education they need watching tv all day (and studies<br/>
have shown it&#39;s not healthy).&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Studies on schooled children. <br/>
<br/>
Many, possibly most, Unschooled children watch all the tv they want, but<br/>
no-one thinks they are getting *all* the education they need from it -<br/>
including the children themselves.<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;And making them happy<br/>
all the time isn&#39;t my job.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Helping Jayn find her joy as much as possible in the world is my job - my<br/>
best job.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;They need and want guidance.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You are defining guidance as Mom makes all the choices that matter, and<br/>
enforce compliance if they disagree. Why are you assuming that Unschoolers<br/>
are not giving guidance to their children?  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I&#39;m still &quot;unschooling.&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Of course you are free to call yourself what you want in real life, although<br/>
I would call it &quot;Relaxed Homeschooling&quot; for accuracy.<br/>
<br/>
But on this list, as we discuss Unschooling, no you are *not*. You stopped<br/>
being one when you started requiring a certain amount of math over your<br/>
children&#39;s stated objections because you stopped trusting them to learn it<br/>
in their own time and their own way.<br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; They choose most of their<br/>
learning experiences and always their education is<br/>
tailored to the way they learn best.  We have no<br/>
lesson plans or checklists or textbooks.  They only<br/>
use workbooks if they want to and then not every page<br/>
or problem must be done, just what they need to learn.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;For example, I require my kids to do math every day. <br/>
We have Math-U-See and they can do a page in it or<br/>
flash cards or something else.  But they have to do<br/>
something.  I also make them do math first.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well which is it then?<br/>
<br/>
No lesson plan except for do math first.<br/>
No checklists except for they have to do something math before they can<br/>
play.<br/>
No textbooks except for Math-U-See, whatever that is.<br/>
<br/>
What really stops you being an Unschooler is that *you* are the one defining<br/>
&quot;just what they need to learn&quot; instead of them.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; They also do a fair amount of helping around the<br/>
house and with the little ones and they don&#39;t have any<br/>
choice about that.  So don&#39;t be afraid to set limits<br/>
or provide more direct guidance.  It&#39;s your job as<br/>
parent.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You are so far from really unschooling just the basic &quot;academic portion&quot;,<br/>
that any discussion of Whole Life Unschooling is beyond consideration. <br/>
<br/>
You are so focused on your children&#39;s deficiencies and how you have to make<br/>
them do stuff to make them up, that it is no wonder you can&#39;t trust them to<br/>
want to help you around the house. <br/>
<br/>
Jayn is never forced to do anything around the house. The result is a<br/>
constant willing helper. Last night my precious, smart, vivacious 5 yo with<br/>
no assigned chores, came joyfully in to tell me she had a surprise for me.<br/>
She proudly displayed how she had carefully removed from the packaging and<br/>
put away into the refrigerator all of her juice boxes, recently brought home<br/>
from the store.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is fear and distrust that prompts the setting of the kind of<br/>
parental comfort limits you are talking about. Living in freedom with<br/>
consensus and mindfulness and Principles instead of rules takes courage and<br/>
commitment, just as much as any choice to move out of the mainstream.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-315201385">Hi, I&#39;ve joined a few days ago after seeing your group on an <br/>
unschoolers list (I think).<br/>
I am rather pleased to have found you as I don&#39;t really feel I fit any <br/>
group properly atm. I live with my dh and 2 dds in New Zealand. Since <br/>
Feb this year I have home schooled my 5.5yo dd after she hated every <br/>
day of the less than 2 weeks she attended school. I have been an <br/>
attachment parent with both my dd (my older dd is 14yo) and so I took <br/>
the (then) very scary step of taking her out. At the time I was also <br/>
reading John Holt&#39;s How children learn.<br/>
I then spent months of worrying, &#39;what have I done&#39; type thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
I started out copying school as I had no idea what else to do. I cringe <br/>
when  I look back now and feel so sorry for my dd. Yet I still find it <br/>
so difficult to let go completely. There are 13 hs fam in our town and <br/>
all of them use curriculum. The school bit I still make my daughter do <br/>
is some hand printing, a &#39;story&#39; one line sentence and she reads a <br/>
reader to me. Even though it doesn&#39;t take her very long to do that, she <br/>
still doesn&#39;t want to do them. I&#39;m getting tired of pushing her and so <br/>
here we are: finally I&#39;m looking at unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
What stops me from just letting her do what she wants is this: as there <br/>
is a big age gap between my dd, my dd has no sibling to play with. We <br/>
were overseas for a year last year and some of her friends moved away <br/>
and we still trying to find more friends for her. After these 9 month <br/>
at home she has recently started to complain a lot about wanting to <br/>
play with friends more and about being bored on her own.<br/>
I can relate to  that very well. My brothers were 8 and 12 yrs older <br/>
too. With the kids from the hs group and the kids she knows from <br/>
school, she still spends too much time on her own, IMO and hers. So if <br/>
she needs to go to school for being with kids, she needs to know a bit <br/>
to fit back in.<br/>
Then I&#39;m not sure if I can keep up hs her. It is exhausting at times to <br/>
be the Mum, playmate, bookreader , taxi driver etc 7 days a week. That <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean I constantly entertain her. She spends many more hours <br/>
playing by herself.  We are both happier when she has a friend over. <br/>
Then she is engaged playing and I can happily do my stuff, knowing she <br/>
is happy, too. Lacking that, I take her places, swimming etc to break <br/>
up a long afternoon etc. She also attends ballet, girl guides and <br/>
Suzuki violin and that takes a bit of running around too, so that I <br/>
feel there is little time to catch up on my jobs.<br/>
So I&#39;m doing the &#39;basics&#39; as a sort of insurance for the &#39;what if&#39; <br/>
scenario.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder how it is for other unschoolers with just one child at home.<br/>
I wonder if I dropped making her do the schooly bits if she would want <br/>
to read and write soon? (If she could read herself, a world of books <br/>
would be avail to her all day long = less need for other kids).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1342442362">Rue, <br/>
I wasn&#39;t saying unschooling parents didn&#39;t parent or<br/>
were uninvolved.  My point to Syndi was that they<br/>
were.  I was talking about what she said her kids were<br/>
doing and her doubts and insecurities.  She said her<br/>
kids weren&#39;t doing things like you mentioned and that<br/>
they didn&#39;t really want her involved.  I just wanted<br/>
her to know it didn&#39;t have to be that way and she<br/>
didn&#39;t need to feel bad that she was squashing their<br/>
creativity and not unschoooling if she did get more<br/>
involved.<br/>
<br/>
I did say it is different for every family and gave an<br/>
example of mine.  My kids don&#39;t do any of the things<br/>
you mentioned.  The only thing they would be<br/>
interested in is money (and while I would love to give<br/>
them an allowance, we can&#39;t afford to).  That&#39;s why I<br/>
require math activities. <br/>
<br/>
I do not require language, history, or science<br/>
activities, because they do stuff in those areas all<br/>
the time and ask questions incessently.  If they loved<br/>
math and did patterns or sorting or whatever all the<br/>
time, then I wouldn&#39;t require it.  If they never read<br/>
a book, then I would require that.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I agree with alot of what you said, because I<br/>
wasn&#39;t speaking against the freedom of unschooling.  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; **In my opinion this kind of minimizing of a<br/>

&gt; responsible, caring adults.  They won&#39;t do that if I<br/>
&gt; leave them to their own devices.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; **I&#39;m not sure what you mean by leaving them to<br/>
&gt; their own devices.<br/>
&gt; Unschooling parents are very involved with their<br/>
&gt; children.  Parents who<br/>
&gt; choose to recognize their children&#39;s autonomy are<br/>
&gt; not dooming their children<br/>
&gt; to a life as irresponsible, uncaring adults.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;They can&#39;t get the<br/>
&gt; education they need watching tv all day (and studies<br/>
&gt; have shown it&#39;s not healthy).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; **Given a rich environment, children will choose the<br/>
&gt; activities that give<br/>
&gt; them exactly what they need.  I don&#39;t need a study<br/>
&gt; to show me that.  I can<br/>
&gt; look at my own children and other free children I<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;So don&#39;t be afraid to set limits<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; **It&#39;s not fear that stops unschooling parents from<br/>
&gt; setting limits and<br/>
&gt; &#39;guiding&#39; in the sense of parents making kids do<br/>
&gt; what the parents think they<br/>
&gt; &#39;should&#39; do.  It&#39;s a belief that children are whole<br/>
&gt; people who are deserving<br/>
&gt; of the same level of respect we would like to be<br/>

I didn&#39;t require them to do math for months and they<br/>
said they&#39;d rather me tell them to.  They like math,<br/>
but never choose to do and get frustrated when they<br/>
want to know how to multiply or divide and can&#39;t.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t put that on them.  I was happy to wait till<br/>
they wre ready.  The thing is they are ready, but need<br/>
that extra push. <br/>
<br/>
I then didn&#39;t require them to do math in the morning,<br/>
but they still wouldn&#39;t get to it all day.  I<br/>
suggested doing it first thing and they thought that<br/>
was a great idea.  How it becomes a requirement is<br/>
when they ask to do math later, I remind them gently<br/>
about before and ask if they think they will do it and<br/>
they honestly say no and agree to do it then.  There<br/>
are no fights or tears or being scared of math.<br/>

I only meant forget about schooling unschooling to get<br/>
some perspective apart from any preconcieved ideas<br/>
about what unschooling is supposed to be.  Not<br/>
everyone, especially those new to it understand. <br/>
People all the time think it&#39;s that crazy thing lazy<br/>
parents do where there kids don&#39;t do anything but<br/>
wathc tv all day and run wild.<br/>
<br/>
I know that&#39;s not the case.  We trust our children to<br/>
learn and are very involved.  We don&#39;t set arbitrary<br/>
rules about school or what time it should be done.  By<br/>
the way my kids do their best in the morning and I<br/>
wrote about the math more in antoher post.  We let<br/>
them learn and discover and if the want to spend all<br/>
day reading and looking up info on the internet about<br/>
mummies or trains or whatever, we don&#39;t interrupt and<br/>
say they have to do language now.  We don&#39;t saysay<br/>
they have to read this book or write a report, but<br/>
thrill when they choose things like that on their own.<br/>
 When they want to learn something but don&#39;t know, we<br/>
help them discover how. <br/>
<br/>
I am definately not recommending (I have hardest time<br/>
spelling this word LOL!) stomping on feelings and what<br/>
parent truly thinks kids need no restrictions in life.<br/>
 I am not forcing my kids to learn.  They learn on<br/>
their own.  They are proud of their efforts and<br/>
accomplishments.  <br/>
<br/>
I do trust my children to learn, but also recognize<br/>
they are children and need some guidance.  I do not<br/>
think unschoolers raise uncaring children, nor do I<br/>
think they are uninvolved.  I believe they are the<br/>
most involved with their children.  That was my point.<br/>
 Being involved is necessary.  I know the people on<br/>
this list must be and tried to explain that.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are not at the tender mercies of a math<br/>
curriculum.  It is a resource they are welcome to use<br/>
and they like it.  I have not subjected them to<br/>
critical scrutiny either.  I can&#39;t understand why you<br/>
seem so angry and presume such bad things about me.<br/>
<br/>
I am very familiar with unschoolingand have been for<br/>
years, though only on this list for few months.  And I<br/>
know guidance isn&#39;t Mom making all the descisions, and<br/>
I don&#39;t, but it is making some of them.  My kids are<br/>
kids and can&#39;t make all the descisions either.  I also<br/>
assumed unschoolers gave that to their kids.<br/>
<br/>
I am glad you have children who are helpful.  Mine are<br/>
also, but won&#39;t lift a finger if Mom doesn&#39;t require<br/>
it.  I don&#39;t focus on their deficiencies, but<br/>
recognize their weaknesses and help them strengthen<br/>
those areas. I haven&#39;t defined what they need to<br/>
learn.  They choose what to learn.  They want to learn<br/>
math.  I help them, but they can do it how they<br/>
choose.  They don&#39;t always use Math-U-See (which isn&#39;t<br/>
a text book).<br/>
<br/>
Rules are not bad and I have the courage to live<br/>
according to my principles.  I am not fearful.  As<br/>
someone who chooses homebirth, breastfeeding,<br/>
unschooling (or relaxed homeschooling, if you prefer),<br/>
attachment parenting, and being a Christian who<br/>
doesn&#39;t approve of President Bush all put me out of<br/>
the mainstream.  <br/>
<br/>
You have made a point though.  I am not welcome on<br/>
this board and will leave it.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Forget about schooling or unschooling, if that<br/>
&gt; confuses you, but think about your goal. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is an Unschooling list. This is not the place<br/>
&gt; to forget about schooling<br/>
&gt; or unschooling.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I only let my kids watch TV or videos/DVDs and<br/>
&gt; play<br/>
&gt; on the computer during late afternoon and evening. <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not so rigid that I don&#39;t make exceptions,<br/>
&gt; especially for stuff that has to do with what they<br/>
&gt; are<br/>
&gt; interested in learning, but it holds true for most<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; time.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; They have freedom in how to learn something<br/>
&gt; and even<br/>
&gt; about when to go play for the most part.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Except for doing math first. Or learning using<br/>
&gt; computer games. Or from<br/>
&gt; DVD&#39;s. Or from playing. Or evidently from math in<br/>
&gt; real life.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Some people are morning people. They learn best<br/>
&gt; first thing after awakening.<br/>
&gt; Others need to warm up to the day, and are at their<br/>
&gt; most productive in the<br/>
&gt; afternoon or evening hours. These time restrictions<br/>
&gt; are arbitrary.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;They never do when left on their own, but admit<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s okay<br/>
&gt; when I make them.  They put up a fuss at first, but<br/>
&gt; are very proud of themselves for what they have<br/>
&gt; learned.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You may believe it&#39;s ok, but it&#39;s not Unschooling.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s not OK to recommend<br/>
&gt; restrictions and enforced teaching or stomping over<br/>
&gt; your children&#39;s feelings<br/>
&gt; until they are defeated, on an Unschooling list.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My child is proud of herself too, and she has never<br/>
&gt; been forced to &quot;learn&quot;<br/>
&gt; anything. Her pride is in what she has accomplished<br/>
&gt; &quot;academically&quot;, not from<br/>
&gt; making her mother happy or approving. Of course I am<br/>
&gt; both of those things.<br/>
&gt; Especially since it is all her own ideas and<br/>
&gt; discoveries.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Mine is to<br/>
&gt; help my kids become educated and grow into<br/>
&gt; responsible, caring adults.  They won&#39;t do that if I<br/>
&gt; leave them to their own devices.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One purpose of this list is to help parents trust<br/>
&gt; that their children will<br/>
&gt; learn all that need to become caring and responsible<br/>
&gt; adults. It is never<br/>
&gt; &quot;leaving them to their own devices&quot; but the<br/>
&gt; opposite. We don&#39;t leave them to<br/>
&gt; the tender mercies of some horrible math curriculum<br/>
&gt; either.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Read for longer. Learn how it works before<br/>
&gt; offensively dismissing us as not<br/>
&gt; caring if our kids grow up to be caring and<br/>
&gt; responsible. Hopefully you will<br/>
&gt; also gain more faith in your children, instead of<br/>
&gt; the amount of critical<br/>
&gt; scrutiny they have been subjected to by you in your<br/>
&gt; post.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; They can&#39;t get the<br/>
&gt; education they need watching tv all day (and studies<br/>
&gt; have shown it&#39;s not healthy).&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Studies on schooled children. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Many, possibly most, Unschooled children watch all<br/>
&gt; the tv they want, but<br/>
&gt; no-one thinks they are getting *all* the education<br/>
&gt; they need from it -<br/>
&gt; including the children themselves.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;And making them happy<br/>
&gt; all the time isn&#39;t my job.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Helping Jayn find her joy as much as possible in the<br/>
&gt; world is my job - my<br/>
&gt; best job.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;They need and want guidance.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You are defining guidance as Mom makes all the<br/>
&gt; choices that matter, and<br/>
&gt; enforce compliance if they disagree. Why are you<br/>
&gt; assuming that Unschoolers<br/>
&gt; are not giving guidance to their children?  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I&#39;m still &quot;unschooling.&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Of course you are free to call yourself what you<br/>
&gt; want in real life, although<br/>
&gt; I would call it &quot;Relaxed Homeschooling&quot; for<br/>
&gt; accuracy.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But on this list, as we discuss Unschooling, no you<br/>
&gt; are *not*. You stopped<br/>
&gt; being one when you started requiring a certain<br/>
&gt; amount of math over your<br/>
&gt; children&#39;s stated objections because you stopped<br/>
&gt; trusting them to learn it<br/>
&gt; in their own time and their own way.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; They choose most of their<br/>
&gt; learning experiences and always their education is<br/>
&gt; tailored to the way they learn best.  We have no<br/>
&gt; lesson plans or checklists or textbooks.  They only<br/>
&gt; use workbooks if they want to and then not every<br/>
&gt; page<br/>
&gt; or problem must be done, just what they need to<br/>
&gt; learn.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;For example, I require my kids to do math every<br/>
&gt; day. <br/>
&gt; We have Math-U-See and they can do a page in it or<br/>
&gt; flash cards or something else.  But they have to do<br/>
&gt; something.  I also make them do math first.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well which is it then?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; No lesson plan except for do math first.<br/>
&gt; No checklists except for they have to do something<br/>
&gt; math before they can<br/>
&gt; play.<br/>
&gt; No textbooks except for Math-U-See, whatever that<br/>
&gt; is.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What really stops you being an Unschooler is that<br/>
&gt; *you* are the one defining<br/>
&gt; &quot;just what they need to learn&quot; instead of them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; They also do a fair amount of helping around<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; house and with the little ones and they don&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; any<br/>
&gt; choice about that.  So don&#39;t be afraid to set limits<br/>
&gt; or provide more direct guidance.  It&#39;s your job as<br/>
&gt; parent.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You are so far from really unschooling just the<br/>
&gt; basic &quot;academic portion&quot;,<br/>
&gt; that any discussion of Whole Life Unschooling is<br/>
&gt; beyond consideration. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You are so focused on your children&#39;s deficiencies<br/>
&gt; and how you have to make<br/>
&gt; them do stuff to make them up, that it is no wonder<br/>
&gt; you can&#39;t trust them to<br/>
&gt; want to help you around the house. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Jayn is never forced to do anything around the<br/>
&gt; house. The result is a<br/>
&gt; constant willing helper. Last night my precious,<br/>
&gt; smart, vivacious 5 yo with<br/>
&gt; no assigned chores, came joyfully in to tell me she<br/>
&gt; had a surprise for me.<br/>
&gt; She proudly displayed how she had carefully removed<br/>
&gt; from the packaging and<br/>
&gt; put away into the refrigerator all of her juice<br/>
&gt; boxes, recently brought home<br/>
&gt; from the store.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think it is fear and distrust that prompts the<br/>
&gt; setting of the kind of<br/>
&gt; parental comfort limits you are talking about.<br/>
&gt; Living in freedom with<br/>
&gt; consensus and mindfulness and Principles instead of<br/>
&gt; rules takes courage and<br/>
&gt; commitment, just as much as any choice to move out<br/>
&gt; of the mainstream.<br/>

Syndi,  <br/>
This may fly in the face of what everyone else thinks<br/>
about  unschooling, but I still give my kids limits  and<br/>
requirements.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Yep. Flies in the face. Still shooing them away.<br/>
 <br/>
Limiting and requirements are antithetical to unschooling.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I started out letting them do whatever they  wanted,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>but they didn&#39;t do anything but read sometimes.   I<br/>
remembered that as their mother I can parent them,<br/>
which includes  guiding and directing their activities.<br/>
They have freedom in how to learn  something and even<br/>
about when to go play for the most part.    &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I let mine do whatever they want, and they are creative and eager learners.  <br/>
Sometimes they don&#39;t do anything but lie and stare at the clouds----and that&#39;s <br/>
 OK too. I remember that as their mother, I can love them----which means <br/>
allowing  them to be exactly Who They Are at this very moment. They have the <br/>
freedom  to learn *everything* and get to play all the time.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;For example, I require my kids to do math every  day. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>We have Math-U-See and they can do a page in it or<br/>

have to do<br/>
something.  I also make them do math first.   They<br/>
never do when left on their own, but admit it&#39;s okay<br/>
when I make  them.  They put up a fuss at first, but<br/>
are very proud of themselves  for what they have<br/>
learned.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I hope NO one here takes this as unschooling advice. It is NOT.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Forget about schooling or unschooling, if  that<br/>
 </span></blockquote>confuses you, but think about your  goal. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
The whole pint of this list is to help you SEE the difference between  <br/>
schooling and unschooling. The GOAL is a joyful childhood, absent of the  coersion <br/>
so often seen in the average home----and certainly in the home of  *this* <br/>
mother. The SIDE EFFECT is an education.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Mine is to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>help my kids become educated and  grow into<br/>
responsible, caring adults.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Mine is to help my kids feel loved and valued for Who They Are now. With  <br/>
that, they will grow up to feel loved and valued adults.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They won&#39;t do that if I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>leave them to their own  devices. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; <br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s really too bad. And sad that you think so.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They can&#39;t get the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>education they need watching tv  all day (and studies<br/>
have shown it&#39;s not healthy).  And making them  happy<br/>
all the time isn&#39;t my job.  They need and  want<br/>
guidance.  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Studies-schmudies. An education comes with the freedom to learn and  a love <br/>
of learning. Coersion and fear will put a stop to learning  faster than <br/>
anything else. Television has NOTHING to do with whether a child  will get an <br/>
&#39;education&#39;.<br/>
 <br/>
My children&#39;s happiness and joy IS my goal. Shortest route to a happy  <br/>
adulthood is a happy childhood. Guidance is good when you know the direction you  <br/>
want to take. It&#39;s worthless if you&#39;re heading in the opposite direction.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I&#39;m still  &quot;unschooling.&quot; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Uh, NO, you&#39;re not. <br/>
 <br/>
Relaxed homeschooling, maybe. CERTAINLY not unschooling. Trust and repect  <br/>
are the cornerstones of unschooling. You&#39;re showing neither of these  traits.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They choose most of their<br/>
 </span></blockquote>learning experiences  and always their education is<br/>
tailored to the way they learn best.  We  have no<br/>
lesson plans or checklists or textbooks.  They only<br/>
use  workbooks if they want to and then not every page<br/>
or problem must be done,  just what they need to learn.<br/>
AND:<br/>
 <br/>
For example, I require my kids to do math every day. <br/>
We have Math-U-See  and they can do a page in it or<br/>
_flash cards_ (mip://05d314e0/flash%20cards)  or something else.  But  they <br/>

when I make  them.  They put up a fuss at first, but<br/>
are very proud of themselves for  what they have<br/>
learned.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Sorry. Can&#39;t have it both ways. You&#39;re requiring, so they&#39;re not choosing.  <br/>
You&#39;re limiting, so they don&#39;t have freedom. You&#39;re forcing, so they&#39;re not  <br/>
trusted.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They also do a fair amount of helping around  the<br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
No choice? No freedom. Know Choice? Know Freedom.<br/>

 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Doesn&#39;t help at ALL on an unschooling list. It hinders. It hurts. It  <br/>
inhibits.<br/>
 <br/>
You may have been &quot;where she is,&quot; but you have no idea where she&#39;s going.  <br/>
Kind of like that guidance question. If you&#39;re trying to get to an usnchooling  <br/>
lifestyle, THAT kind of guidance is wrong and won&#39;t help at all on the  path.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1670016080">What she was questioning was not really whether her kids are fine, but <br/>
whether it was okay that SHE wasn&#39;t as hands-on involved in what they <br/>
were doing all day as what somebody on another list made it sound like <br/>
she ought to be.<br/>
<br/>
Syndi sounds to me like they&#39;re going through a phase of the kids being <br/>
happy and content with what they&#39;re doing. Having mom &quot;involved&quot; in <br/>
what they&#39;re doing throughout the day-in the sense of playing WITH <br/>
them, reading WITH them, and so on, is sometimes how things work and <br/>
sometimes not. Supporting their interests so that they CAN spend their <br/>
day content and happy is always how it works. Sounds to me like she&#39;s <br/>
doing that, along with continuing to offer additional possibilities, <br/>
and her kids are fine.<br/>
<br/>
One of my own reality-checks was that I wouldn&#39;t interfere when the kid <br/>
were already content and happy and busy with their own chosen <br/>
activities, to try to induce them to do something else just because I <br/>
thought it was more valuable. I&#39;ve done exactly what Syndi described, <br/>
offered other possibilities and let them take me up on it if and when <br/>
THEY wanted to do so.<br/>
<br/>
Christa, your advice was to impose herself and activities of her <br/>
choosing ON her kids, even though they&#39;re perfectly content and happy <br/>
and busy doing their own things.<br/>
<br/>
Why would that be good advice?<br/>

<br/>
I think you are talking about book work or formal computational <br/>
exercises of some kind. That&#39;s not math.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Why not show them right then - that&#39;s the very best time to learn, when <br/>
there is an actual need. Actually, it is the only time anybody REALLY <br/>
learns in a useful way - because if they learn out of context, they <br/>
often never develop the ability to know when to use the practiced <br/>
technique.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve told a bunch of times about how Roxana learned to do long division <br/>
because it is such a good example of an unschooled kid/mom interaction <br/>
regarding math. She wanted to travel to New York, around 3,000 miles <br/>
away, and wanted to know how long it would take us to drive there, so <br/>
she asked me how many miles we could travel in a day. I just said, &quot;Oh <br/>
around 350 miles per day, probably.&quot; She proceeded to subtract 350 from <br/>
3,000 over and over, to figure out how many 350&#39;s there were in 3,000. <br/>
I walked by and saw what she was doing and that she was frustrated, <br/>
because she&#39;d made a mistake in her subtraction early on and had just <br/>
noticed it, and I said, &quot;There is an easier way to do that.&quot; She was <br/>
eager to learn the easier way, and I told her that she had to be a <br/>
little patient and let me show her some simpler ones first, but that <br/>
pretty quickly she&#39;d be able to do the harder kind she wanted to do. So <br/>
I showed her 6 divided by 3 and then 60 divided by 3 and then 60 <br/>
divided by 30 and then 600 divided by 30 and then 600 divided by 15 and <br/>
then some with remainders. Then I said, &quot;Okay, you can do the one you <br/>
wanted to now.&quot; She was SO excited - this was a short-cut she could <br/>
really appreciate. I told her, &quot;This is called long division.&quot; Her <br/>
response: &quot;Wow, but this is so cool. Why do people always groan and act <br/>
like they hate long division?&quot;  And she had me give her about 10 more <br/>
big long problems to play with. She did those and that was it. Her one <br/>
and only ever &quot;lesson&quot; on long division and it lasted about 30 minutes <br/>
total, including her extra practice time at the end.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling math doesn&#39;t mean leaving kids frustrated by not knowing <br/>
basic arithmetic like multiplication and division. It means that they <br/>
learn them because they want to learn them and very often they simply <br/>
pick them up the same way they picked up reading and writing. This was <br/>
one time that the need was very apparent and the response was for me to <br/>
quickly help her learn what she wanted to know. But, keep in mind, <br/>
she&#39;s never had one single minute of being required to do any math <br/>
(she&#39;s 17 now) and she&#39;s perfectly adept at basic arithmetic and has <br/>
good conceptual understanding of all kinds of math concepts that she <br/>
probably couldn&#39;t even name. She&#39;s been talking about wanting to do <br/>
some algebra - she&#39;s thinking about college requirements at this point <br/>
and is going to want to take the math placement test at the college at <br/>
some point, and hopes to not have to start at the very beginning of the <br/>
college math sequence - so I bought some algebra books that I thought <br/>
she might find to her liking. She fooled with them a little bit and now <br/>
they&#39;ve been sitting around for a couple of months. I think that is <br/>
because she&#39;s been very busy - doing two shows and writing a novel and <br/>
taking musical theater related classes. It&#39;s fine, I&#39;m not even <br/>
reminding her about the algebra books, because she knows they are there <br/>
and she could work with them if that&#39;s what she wanted. Maybe when <br/>
she&#39;s less busy, I&#39;ll ask her if she wants to go back to them with my <br/>
help.<br/>
<br/>
