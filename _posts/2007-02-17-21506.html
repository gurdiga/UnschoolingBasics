written here and what we do at our house, is that *I* am not the one <br/>
who makes this decision. I may make offers and suggestions and help <br/>
brainstorm different solutions, but we all try to work together to <br/>
find ways to do the things we want to do. <br/>
<br/>
Some days that&#39;s easier than others! But over time we have developed <br/>
a mutually supportive family relationship, rather than an <br/>
adversarial one. There isn&#39;t a sense of picking one person&#39;s needs <br/>
*over* another&#39;s. Everyone&#39;s needs are important, but sometimes we <br/>
all need to do some juggling and prioritizing and problem solving. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-457045592">It isn&#39;t me, I swear.  We are the happiest of unschoolers on the block. I&#39;m <br/>
not just sideways asking, really &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, here is what I wrote in response to the person who e-mailed me. <br/>
Maybe someone else will find it helpful:<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve got a lot of things going on there.<br/>
<br/>
First is your concern about balancing everyone needs, and that can be an <br/>
issue however you approach parenting. What are the things that your children <br/>
want to do? Is there a way you can do two things at once, breastfeeding and <br/>
reading a story, building with lego while watching a movie, fixing dinner <br/>
and chatting or dancing to the radio, or spending that time chatting with <br/>
your husband. David and I cook in tandem a lot of the time. I do the <br/>
tortillas he makes the spanish rice. Lots of talking and touching and the <br/>
yummy aromas fill the room. Are there ways that you and your husband can <br/>
find spousal time that isn&#39;t completely about in the evening, after the kids <br/>
have gone to bed, sitting in the living room sort of thing? Can you get up <br/>
with him in the morning to hang out before he goes to work (if he is the <br/>
wage earner in the family)?<br/>
<br/>
If you want to unschool, really, really want to get the unschooling mindset <br/>
and incorporate it into your life and your family&#39;s lives than you have to <br/>
find other ways to achieving certain goals. That means letting go of the <br/>
idea that adult time can only occur at certain times of day or that children <br/>
have to toughen up eventually otherwise how would they fit in the working <br/>
world. Unschooling takes a creative approach to life. It also takes you not <br/>
being the only person picking the requests. On the drive home from bike <br/>
riding today, when we&#39;d all gotten cold, I suggested making hot chocolate. <br/>
We only had one packet of premix left, but we had all the fixings for <br/>
homemade. Simon volunteered letting Linnaea have the premix, which is her <br/>
preference, without being asked. I didn&#39;t have to choose who &quot;won&quot; that <br/>
time, they figured it out themselves. Unschooling takes being proactive, <br/>
like bringing food to someone who might be hungry or offering to help <br/>
someone when they are working through a frustrating level on a game, or <br/>
being sympathetic, or helping someone to be left alone when they are angry <br/>
or frustrated and the distraction will help them to erupt.<br/>
<br/>
And to address your second question, if I&#39;m too nice to my children how will <br/>
they learn that the world can be a harsh place to live so that they won&#39;t be <br/>
disappointed when they get there? What if because you were so nice to your <br/>
children they learned that they liked living in a nice world so they figured <br/>
out ways to enjoy their lives and relish the nice moments. What if they saw <br/>
you deal with adversity, hard things, which happen in my life and in yours, <br/>
I imagine, with an eye to finding the nice things, the good things, with you <br/>
trying to make the best out of the worst possible aspects of your life. We <br/>
are currently trying to live within a budget. That means that the grocery <br/>
shopping could be filled with stress and angst as we tend to overspend most <br/>
there. Last time we went there was a point when we&#39;d clearly gone past our <br/>
budget, so Linnaea and I looked through the cart and picked out a couple of <br/>
high priced things and put them back. There was no stress, none. And when we <br/>
were done we were quite a way under the anticipated overspend. Diana Jenner, <br/>
who is on many of the unschooling lists, had her daughter die to leukemia a <br/>
year ago. She lost her husband to cancer 8 years ago, I think. There is no <br/>
way that her son, Hayden, will ever believe that because Diana is nice to <br/>
her the world isn&#39;t full of adversity. But what he will know is that <br/>
adversity can be survived and that you don&#39;t have to feel miserable every <br/>
moment to grieve. And that this moment, right now, it is the best possible <br/>
moment to live and to be who and how you want to be.<br/>
<br/>
For the third question, can unschoolers go to college?  Yes, I know that <br/>
Sandra Dodd&#39;s son Kirby has taken a few classes at community college. At <br/>
least one of Pam Sooroshian&#39;s daughters is at university now. Joyce <br/>
Fetteroll&#39;s daughter, who isn&#39;t 18 yet, is taking college classes. Peter <br/>
Kowalke, who was unschooled, has been and gone to college, his webpage is <br/>
here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.peterkowalke.com/">http://www.peterkowalke.com/</a> . I am a high school dropout and I have a <br/>
master&#39;s degree. People from many different backgrounds get into university. <br/>
I don&#39;t know if Simon or Linnaea will ever attend university. That is a long <br/>
way away. But I have no doubt that if what they want to do includes spending <br/>
some time at university, and they want to follow that dream enough, they <br/>
will go to university. I think that is the difference with an unschooled <br/>
child, university isn&#39;t an end in and of itself. I went to university to <br/>
find out what I wanted to be. I don&#39;t think that will be Simon&#39;s or <br/>
Linnaea&#39;s experience.<br/>
<br/>
One of the things that helps me when I feel like I&#39;m not living unschooling <br/>
well, or that unschooling isn&#39;t the way forward, is to stop and think about <br/>
what I want my life to be like. I want my children to be happy, to feel safe <br/>
and good and to be happy. I want them to enjoy being with me. I don&#39;t need <br/>
them to enjoy each other, I can&#39;t dictate their relationships with other <br/>
people, but I can do a lot to try and make them feel good about how they get <br/>
along with me. I think joy is an amazing gift that I can help them to <br/>
access. And when I think about that, say after I&#39;ve yelled at them and I&#39;m <br/>
sitting deciding if I want to feel justified in my rage, I breathe better <br/>
and I let go of that anger and I see them as people who I enjoy being with <br/>
and who I want to help get through whatever it was that they are struggling <br/>
with.<br/>
<br/>
I would strongly recommend that you post your questions to <br/>
unschooling_basics or unschooling discussion. I only have two children so <br/>
may not be particularly good at helping you to work through any of your <br/>
issues with juggling more. My husband is home a lot of the time, and while <br/>
we both miss time together sometimes, we are pretty good at getting time <br/>
together. If you want me to post your questions anonymously, I&#39;ll happily do <br/>
that. No one on the lists wants to do anything but help you get to a place <br/>
where you can unschool. I know the lists can be intense, but it helps if you <br/>
imagine that the people are speaking to you as nicely as they can speak and <br/>
that they are trying to help.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1431219525"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; well, if I pick one of the requests, does the tell the other  <br/>
&gt; members in my family that they are less important?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Only if they feel they need to compete for a limited quantity.<br/>
<br/>
If they feel that your goal is to help them get what they want, then  <br/>
being the one who gets it first isn&#39;t as important.<br/>
<br/>
That shift in how they view you isn&#39;t something that happens  <br/>
instantly. It comes over time as they gain confidence from your  <br/>
actions of working to meet their needs. When they know fully -- from  <br/>
past  actions -- that their needs are important to you, then they&#39;ll  <br/>
be more willing to wait for you to have the opportunity to help them.<br/>
<br/>
But if they feel that mom&#39;s help is limited, then they will compete  <br/>
to get it just as people compete to get anything that&#39;s rationed.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that many mothers suffer is the need to be the fixer of  <br/>
problems. And kids&#39; requests can feel like: Drop what you&#39;re doing  <br/>
and fix this right now. But part of the mental shift is seeing  <br/>
yourself as a facilitator, helping kids get what they need rather  <br/>
than taking on the burden of their problem and solving it for them,  <br/>
if you can see the subtle difference.<br/>
<br/>
The actions may end up looking the same, but the change is a shift in  <br/>
attitude.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, if a child has saved up enough money for a new video  <br/>
game and says &quot;Mom, I need to go get this game. It came out today.&quot;  <br/>
The fixer of problems will think &quot;Oh, geez, another thing added to my  <br/>
list of things to do.&quot; The facilitator will say, &quot;Okay, let&#39;s look at  <br/>
the schedule. Here&#39;s what we have to do today. Let&#39;s see where we can  <br/>
work that in.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; However, I do not want my sons thinking the world revolves around  <br/>
&gt; their needs.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They can&#39;t. Life has a way of teaching them that. Other people will  <br/>
say no to them. Life won&#39;t always work out the way they want it to.<br/>
<br/>
What you can, though, do is let them know that you&#39;re on their team.  <br/>
That you&#39;re there to help them get what they want from the world.<br/>
<br/>
(Note, though, that part of what they want is to be a part of society  <br/>
so part of helping them is finding solutions that respect others  <br/>
needs as well.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but how do you handle these issues in the furture?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They don&#39;t arise. People who are treated with respect, treat others  <br/>
with respect. It&#39;s almost as simple as that :-)<br/>
<br/>
(Which isn&#39;t to say that kids raised this way are perfect angels ;-)  <br/>
Sometimes kids forget. Sometimes they get caught up in their own  <br/>
needs. Sometimes they don&#39;t see the big picture. But it helps  <br/>
enormously to see those times as honest mistakes. They&#39;re just  <br/>
learning. They *will* get it wrong sometimes. And it helps enormously  <br/>
to not treat them as though the mistake is a deliberate one done out  <br/>
of meanness. Treat them as though they are doing the best they can  <br/>
with the skills and knowledge and understanding of themselves and the  <br/>
world that they have in the moment.)<br/>
<br/>
The only caveat I&#39;d throw in there is treating ourselves with respect  <br/>
also. Working our own needs into our help without demanding that  <br/>
others respect our needs. It&#39;s up to us to respect our own needs.  <br/>
(Which is where the &quot;doormat moms&quot; go wrong.)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a tricky balance trying to figure out our own needs. Most of us  <br/>
grew up with the implied promise that when we were grownups it would  <br/>
be our turn to &quot;get our way&quot;. Adulthood would be when we could do  <br/>
whatever we wanted. That was a big lie of course and we can find it  <br/>
feels like we&#39;re in a war trying to fight for our right to do what we  <br/>
want, to the point that we increase others unhappiness to try to make  <br/>
ourselves happy. :-/<br/>
<br/>
As an example, if a child comes up and says at 10PM &quot;I want some ice  <br/>
cream and Sasha just ate the last of it.&quot; The fixer of problems might  <br/>
feel the right thing to do is go out to the store at 10PM, and then  <br/>
feel guilty that they don&#39;t want to, and then angry that a child  <br/>
would even put them in the position of being the bad guy who wants to  <br/>
say &#39;No, I&#39;m not taking you to the store right now.&#39;&quot; We don&#39;t need  <br/>
to set our need to go to bed aside. We can, though, say &quot;I wish we  <br/>
had some more. Let&#39;s put it on the list and get some tomorrow. [Or  <br/>
whatever is reasonable in a particular family&#39;s circumstances.] If we  <br/>
can get moving in time, we might be able to have ice cream for  <br/>
breakfast! But in the meantime, let&#39;s see what else is available.&quot;  <br/>
And try to find something that&#39;s even better.<br/>
<br/>
That might only have partial success at the beginning with kids who  <br/>
are used to competing with each other for whatever is limited. But  <br/>
over time, as kids gain confidence that their needs are important to  <br/>
you and that you are working at meeting them even if you can&#39;t right  <br/>
now, they will be more willing to accept substitutes for now and delays.<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of typical questions answered at:<br/>
