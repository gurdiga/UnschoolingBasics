<div id="ygrps-yiv-1472362520">I don&#39;t know anything about this book or this guy. But based on title alone, <br/>
I agree. Kids and adults need to hear no from others and also, maybe more <br/>
importantly, need to know the freedom of being able to say no. And if we <br/>
want the freedom to say it, we need to accept the reality that we&#39;ll hear  <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
This is one of the things I learned in my own unschool life. My parents <br/>
never said no. I had a very hard time saying no to anyone, and when I <br/>
started trying to assert myself, I used it to harshly. Live and learn.<br/>

Much love,<br/>

I  don&#39;t know anything about this book or this guy. But based on title  <br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
You are so right! How can you ever learn to assert yourself if  your parents <br/>
don&#39;t show you how by their example. And no isn&#39;t  always negative it is just <br/>
&quot;no.&quot; Saying no, saying yes and  saying &quot;I&#39;m sorry I wish I knew but I don&#39;t <br/>
know&quot; are all ways of  saying &quot;I love you.&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
My personal pet peeve isn&#39;t with people who don&#39;t say  no, its with people <br/>
who always speak in the same soft gentle passive voice  and never use a &quot;I MEAN <br/>
BUSINESS&quot; voice. I think that really hurts  children in the long run. I saw a <br/>
child raised that way get bit by a baby  rattle snake because his mom was <br/>
saying &quot;please don&#39;t walk there,  sweetheart don&#39;t touch that, the snake will bite <br/>
and it will  feel like an ouchie boo boo&quot; in almost a whisper and the 3 year <br/>
old simply  ignored her walked forward, reached down at the snake and got bit. <br/>
I  was still pretty little but I remember back then feeling thankful  that my <br/>
mom and dad would have screamed until their voices bled in order  to keep me <br/>
out of danger, even if it scared me a little. And even if they  had to stay <br/>
whisper quiet (as to not arouse a snake) they could do it in a  way that made me <br/>
listen and do what I was told. They were such kind  gentle affectionate <br/>
respectful people, but there were those handful of  times that they really told us <br/>
the way it was going to be &quot;or else.&quot; They  said don&#39;t come home pregnant or <br/>
with some funky STD and so we didn&#39;t have  sex. They told us that we would <br/>
disgrace ourselves forever if we  tried drugs so we never tried them. And the time <br/>
my mom caught me with a  &quot;clove&quot; cigarette (remember those? for those of you <br/>
that went to high  school in the late 80&#39;s early 90&#39;s) she said that she would <br/>
kill me  with her bare hands before the cigarettes killed me if she ever saw <br/>
me  with one again. I remember almost instantly respecting her and loving her  <br/>
even more than I already did and Lord knows I never smoked one of those or  <br/>
even stood NEXT to someone smoking after that! My mom is my best friend in  the <br/>
whole world and sometimes best friends have to get tough with each  other. I <br/>
respect the heck out of my parents for sometimes having to get  tough and feel <br/>
sorry for children who don&#39;t have that in their  lives.<br/>

My parents said similar things and I rebelled big time - drugs, sex,<br/>
alcohol, staying at boyfriends homes overnight instead of where I said I<br/>

<br/>
I know my kids are relating to me a whole lot better since I have become<br/>
more conscious about how I word my &#39;no&#39;s&#39;.  And since I&#39;ve been conscious of<br/>
letting go of unnecessary control (necessary control for me would be to<br/>
avoid a life threatening situation as described by you), they are more<br/>
responsible, think about things more and whether they really wanted what<br/>
they asked for after all, just an all round better situation for the whole<br/>
family.  Plus, and its a big plus, my life (and I&#39;m thinking theirs too) is<br/>
more peaceful and joy filled.<br/>

<br/>
While those statements are true, thinking that we need to do  <br/>
something specific, eg, say no, in order to impart that lesson is a  <br/>
huge stumbling block towards unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
By focusing on helping our kids get what they want from life, by our  <br/>
kids seeing us working to help them within the limitations of life  <br/>
(for example, saying &quot;I&#39;d be happy to go to the grocery store in the  <br/>
morning but right now I&#39;m exhausted. Let&#39;s see if we can find a  <br/>
substitute until then,&quot; they&#39;ll figure out for themselves that the  <br/>
whole world doesn&#39;t stop for them. They don&#39;t need to hear no to  <br/>
learn that.<br/>
<br/>
Helping kids navigate the realities of life is a much better route to  <br/>
unschooling than saying no in order to get some lesson into them.<br/>

pregnant. (Or runaway pregnant.)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not the no that makes kids listen. It&#39;s building a relationship  <br/>
of trust. It takes a huge amount of work to get to the point where a  <br/>
parent can say an occasional &quot;Don&#39;t,&quot; and the child will take that to  <br/>
heart. It&#39;s a huge huge disservice to the thoughtful work involved in  <br/>
building relationships that people discuss here and work on to boil  <br/>
it down to a message that suggests all of that can be gotten by  <br/>
saying &quot;No&quot; to kids.<br/>

gosh it worked for almost everyone I associate with! we  grew up in a very <br/>
close knit community of 1st generation Slavic  people and everyone knew everyone <br/>
else and everyone&#39;s parents handled it  this way and none of us got into <br/>
trouble. I am always amazed by people who  don&#39;t listen to their parents. I did in <br/>
small unharmful ways, ways they  thought were amusing, but never in ways that <br/>
did end up hurting my life  and future. I trusted them to be right (and they <br/>
always were!!) Same with  my better half&#39;s upbringing and all of our cousins <br/>
and siblings. I guess  we just had super great families?<br/>

&gt;huge stumbling block towards unschooling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;By focusing on helping our kids get what they want from life, by our<br/>
&gt;kids seeing us working to help them within the limitations of life<br/>
&gt;(for example, saying &quot;I&#39;d be happy to go to the grocery store in the<br/>
&gt;morning but right now I&#39;m exhausted. Let&#39;s see if we can find a<br/>
&gt;substitute until then,&quot; they&#39;ll figure out for themselves that the<br/>
&gt;whole world doesn&#39;t stop for them. They don&#39;t need to hear no to<br/>
&gt;learn that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Helping kids navigate the realities of life is a much better route to<br/>
&gt;unschooling than saying no in order to get some lesson into them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1477957760">~They said don&#39;t come home pregnant or<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; with some funky STD and so we didn&#39;t have sex~<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When my two oldest ds (now 23 & 25) were in their early teen years I gave both of them a box of condoms & the offer to discuss anything they wanted totally without judgment.  I knew that in the throws of passion, they weren&#39;t going to stop because I said so.  Mom saying &quot;No don&#39;t do that, your too young&quot;  wasn&#39;t going to deter something they felt they were ready to do.  So I wanted them prepared ~ responsibly mind & body.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what happened~ my youngest of the two took them to school (they were in PS at the time) and blew them up on the  bus like balloons ... LOL.  That&#39;s what he thought of having sex.  My oldest kept them for awhile & threw them away when they expired ( didn&#39;t use any )  and asked me to get him more just incase.  Neither of them (to my knowledge) got anyone pregnant or came home with a STD.<br/>
<br/>
I knew from the beginning  ~ and from experience ~  that my mom saying &quot;No, sex is not for the unmarried&quot;  didn&#39;t stop me from becoming pregnant at the age of 16.<br/>
<br/>
So instead of saying no ........  listen & talk with your teens.  Knowing they can come to you & express themselves openly is good for them & you.<br/>

I would totally agree with you Adriana.  My parents were more authoritarian<br/>
and not physical and a *no* was a *no* and *because I said so*.  I have<br/>
never been able to relate to that, and I remember having trouble in high<br/>
school maths because with trigonometry I couldn&#39;t get the *why* we had to do<br/>
it and the teachers just kept saying *because you need to know*, drove me<br/>
nuts....<br/>
<br/>
I think too in my case I didn&#39;t respect my parents; more a fearful type of<br/>
respect and so I snuck around and did what I did.  I do agree that certain<br/>
children need to feel boundaries to feel secure but it needs to be done in a<br/>
gentle, caring, respectful way rather than simply done from a position of<br/>
power.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think in the context of a supportive, trusting environment, &quot;You  <br/>
better not come home pregnant&quot; could be heard as just an obvious  <br/>
statement of what&#39;s already accepted.<br/>
<br/>
But the point isn&#39;t whether or not it&#39;s heard as loving or  <br/>
controlling by a particular person. The point is how can we create an  <br/>
environment where kids trust that our goal is to help them get what  <br/>
they want?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No&quot; doesn&#39;t create that environment. Saying &quot;Yes&quot; -- and saying it  <br/>
mindfully as Ren pointed out -- does. Actively helping them move  <br/>
towards what they&#39;re trying to get is how we build their trust that  <br/>
we want to help them get what they want.<br/>
<br/>
There are two separate arguments going on here: One side is arguing  <br/>
that never saying no is a bad idea. The other side is clearly saying  <br/>
that&#39;s not the point and trying to discuss the more important issue  <br/>
of how to create a trusting environment.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe to get past the impasse, for those who are arguing that it&#39;s  <br/>
necessary to say no, in what instances did you feel that the best  <br/>
option has been to say no?<br/>

  How do you threaten to kill your child and do it with respect and love?  And would she really have killed you?  I&#39;m sure not, so why threaten you with that?<br/>

  My Mom used to make similar threats and it did nothing to make us do what she asked/said -- we just got better at not getting caught.<br/>

&quot;You better not<br/>
ever come home pregnant or blah, blah, blah&quot;.  It sounds like you might<br/>
have a hard time examining the not-so-great  parts about the way you<br/>
were raised along with the wonderful parts.  You can love your parents<br/>
dearly and still recognize where you might  do better.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never felt more love because someone told me &quot;you  better not&quot;. It<br/>
sounds like your upbringing was pretty sheltered in a  lot of ways.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wow, I&#39;m in the minority of people who do not  feel I could &quot;do better&quot; than <br/>
my parents (instead I only DREAM of being as  wonderful as they were) yet this <br/>
isn&#39;t a good thing?!  SHEESH! I  think of myself as the luckiest lady on <br/>
earth. I&#39;m so glad I fell in love  with a man who has the same regard for his <br/>
parents and who&#39;s parents have  the same regard for theirs! Its a really GREAT way <br/>
to feel and life sure  is happy for all involved. <br/>
 <br/>
Maybe my childhood was sheltered but I thank God  for that! We all turned out <br/>
very healthy and didn&#39;t get ourselves  into the kind of trouble that I&#39;ve <br/>
seen ruin people; early sex, drugs,  self-disrespecting behavior. I DID feel <br/>
loved by &quot;you better not&quot; and I  still feel loved when my better half tells me <br/>
what streets he doesn&#39;t want  me driving on (because they are unsafe) or how late <br/>
at night it too late  to go to the market (also because of safety). <br/>
 <br/>
But it isn&#39;t as if something &quot;bad&quot; will happen in our  relationship if I do <br/>
go to the market after dark; I&#39;ll simply come  home to some comment like &quot;so <br/>
you like being out with the muggers?&quot; (think  an episode of Raymond) it is all <br/>
very tongue and cheek, joking yet a  little serious at the same time, and very <br/>
loving as in &quot;if I didn&#39;t love  you I wouldn&#39;t tell you what to do.&quot; I TRULY <br/>
think this could just be  a cultural thing because he is Italian and I am <br/>
extremely ethnic as well  (Croatian, similar culturally) and we tell each other and <br/>
our children and  our parents and friends, etc...  that we love one another  <br/>
by being busy bodies and telling each other what to do constantly.  Maybe if <br/>
you aren&#39;t part of our culture you can&#39;t understand it. I  would be DEVASTATED <br/>
(and feel very unloved) if I wore a new outfit in  front or my mom, aunts and <br/>
sisters and it didn&#39;t get &quot;critiqued&quot; in a  multitude of ways (just perfect, <br/>
too tight in the butt, do you think  you are Brittany Spears, you shouldn&#39;t <br/>
wear stripes, makes you look busty,  etc...) to which I would respond &quot;kiss my <br/>
too tight ass&quot; and everyone  would burst into laughter and hug. When we leave <br/>
each other alone and  do what normal people call &quot;respectful&quot; it is actually (in <br/>
our culture) a  way of being really mean to  someone.          <br/>
 <br/>
In terms of the pregnancy thing, the &quot;light and regular&quot;  way of saying it in <br/>
my family every now and then (this was always in  response to finding out <br/>
that some kid at school had done something they  didn&#39;t approve of) was &quot;you <br/>
better not&quot; but it was really more of just a  knee-jerk thing to say than the only <br/>
way they said it. There were the rare  occasions that we&#39;d be sitting at the <br/>
table or going to bed and brushing  our teeth and they would go into more <br/>
depth about how they felt about it.  That if we did something like that, we would <br/>
then have to be 100%  responsible for the baby financially and otherwise which <br/>
meant no more  riding lessons, no more ponies, no more music lessons, and of <br/>
course  living on our own - all things we didn&#39;t want happening. They made it  <br/>
VERY CLEAR that they would love us and be &quot;in love&quot; with us forever no  mat<br/>
ter what, but they wouldn&#39;t support us financially because when you  have sex <br/>
you MUST be old enough to support yourself and take  care of all the <br/>
consequences that sex can lead to. What could  be wrong with that. So really, they <br/>
weren&#39;t saying &quot;no&quot; to  sex, they were saying &quot;if you do it, you should be prepared <br/>
to live  as an adult, and we will be sad about that (and feel disgraced as a  <br/>
family) but will love you no matter what.&quot; To me that is very  HEALTHY, <br/>
truthful and practical. <br/>

How do you threaten to kill your child and do it with respect and  love? And <br/>
would she really have killed you? I&#39;m sure not, so why  threaten you with that?<br/>
she saw people die of lung cancer and ruin their lives  with cigarettes and <br/>
when she found out that I tried a few she totally LOST  it and said things that <br/>
were TOTALLY out of character for her. To see her  with that passion, <br/>
craziness and trauma in her eyes, tears pouring  down her face really HIT ME like a <br/>
ton of bricks. I thought &quot;OH CRAP  I am doing something AWFUL with my life I <br/>
can&#39;t do this anymore!&quot; For her  to fall from grace like this was absolutely out <br/>
of character. She is the  gentlest most soft spoken kind loving human being <br/>
on earth. It was  THE PERFECT way for me to see her be about something so <br/>
serious.  My Mom used to make similar threats and it did  nothing to make us do <br/>
what she asked/said -- we just got better at not  getting caught.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As I said, this was totally out of character for her.  The fact that she did <br/>
something like this 2 or 3 times total in  her whole life is probably why it <br/>
had such a great effect. If  you are constantly freaking out about everything <br/>
kids (and everyone else)  will tune you out. She selected the PERFECT time and <br/>
way to &quot;loose it&quot;  and every time someone remarks about how nice it is that I <br/>
never  developed bad health habits that interfere with my career (I sing opera <br/>
 and jazz for a living) I look back at that moment and think about all she  <br/>
did for me. <br/>
 <br/>
That story (the &quot;I will kill you before the cigarette&#39;s  do&quot;) is a story my <br/>
children 11,9 and 7 already have heard and laugh  about with their Baka <br/>
(grandma) and they always ask her or me to tell it.  They see it as loving, funny <br/>
after the fact, and just part of our  crazy family. <br/>

into a fire place.  They had put it so that there was not a single<br/>
situation in which the word &quot;No&quot; was appropriate.  Sometimes, &quot;No&quot; in a<br/>
firm voice (not &quot;mean&quot;) is a great time saver and lets kids know that<br/>
whatever is going on needs to stop.<br/>

However, since unschooling, I have become more and more of a YES mom,<br/>
and it&#39;s pretty much my default answer for many things (after finding<br/>
out how much arbitrary restriction I had put on my kids without even<br/>
realizing it)..  Now, when they hear the word &quot;no&quot;, it&#39;s a different<br/>
enough word, that they know I must indeed mean it, rather than as the<br/>
default drone which originally caused them to say, &quot;yeah, knew she&#39;d say<br/>
that&quot;.<br/>
