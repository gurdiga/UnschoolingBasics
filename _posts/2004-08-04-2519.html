<div id="ygrps-yiv-1056063925">we went to the library this afternoon and our ds that&#39;s 8 went in search of<br/>
more military and gun books.He asked for help and then when they showed him<br/>
where to look he worked by himself. He is so excited about the military and<br/>
police that his conversation is about that most of the time. He got into a<br/>
discussion with the male librarian (who is British and  a prior-royal<br/>
marine). Things were going well until Jacob said &quot;I have decided to go into<br/>
the military. The librarian said &quot;you have several years before you need to<br/>
think about that.&quot;<br/>
  I walked up about then and was listening. The gist of the talk was Jacob<br/>
was way too young to be so into guns and military stuff. His parting comment<br/>
was &quot;you know what you need? you need to just be a little boy and play<br/>
instead of thinking about all of that stuff.&quot; My comment was.&quot;he is playing<br/>
stuff a little boy would play with.&quot;<br/>
  I know lots of boys that play police or army etc.<br/>
  I asked my son what he thought about the discussion. He said &quot;I don&#39;t<br/>
think he likes what I am interested in. But he didn&#39;t have to tell me I<br/>
should be playing something else. I think it makes him uncomfortable.&quot;<br/>
  I agree.<br/>
   He was very strong on his opinion of tv. today. I asked him if he had a<br/>
list of Reading Rainbow books like the Newberry list. I wanted to get some<br/>
ideas for possible good reads for the kids. He started telling me his kids<br/>
do not watch any tv. zip...none. They don&#39;t even own one.It wasn&#39;t until I<br/>
was checking out and he was looking on the computer to see if there were<br/>
such books as Reading Rainbow. I tried to explain it was a tv. show about<br/>
books. He seemed to by pass my input because it involved the tv. The other<br/>
worker explained that it is all about books and kids share their opinion of<br/>
the ones they have read. Then it was ok and he said &quot;Maybe I need to watch<br/>
some tv.&quot; <br/>

 <br/>
Not knowing his side of the story, it&#39;s hard to know what made him  <br/>
uncomfortable. Possibly he actually killed someone and would rather forget about  it. <br/>
And hates to think of a very young boy in his situation. Maybe he wishes he  <br/>
could have stayed a little boy longer!<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe Jacob could talk to him further next visit and ask how he feels  about <br/>
his stint in the service. I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll tell of not all fun &  games.<br/>

 <br/>
I have a friend who is on one of the Reading Rainbows. Christian Thee. An  <br/>
artist and magician. Look for that one!<br/>
 <br/>
One of my librarians and I were talking about the push to read so early and  <br/>
stupid reading incentives. She suggested that I read Jim Trelease&#39;s books. <br/>
 <br/>
He says lots of good things about letting children read when they are  ready, <br/>
not to push, avoid extrinsic motivators, and just reading TO them.<br/>
 <br/>
But, bummer! He also would like all TV&#39;s banned and burned.  :~P~~~~~~~~~*<br/>
 <br/>
I had to tell her what I REALLY thought of him when I finished his book.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
And for those of you that missed the first conference, he&#39;s INCREDIBLE.<br/>
He is definitely someone following his bliss. His art is really fun, he weaves magic and art together in the most amazing ways...my kids were floored at his picture that changes when you close the shutters on it, and re-open it to a different scene.<br/>
