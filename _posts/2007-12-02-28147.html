<div id="ygrps-yiv-2042388191">Hello Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Kali, and I am brand new to this.  I live in Columbia South <br/>
Carolina, and my 10th grader just moved back home with me after living <br/>
with his dad in Hawaii for the last year.  We have tried the high <br/>
schools here in the past, and they just don&#39;t work for him.  I have <br/>
another child who attends the school district here, and loves it!  It <br/>
is so true that each child is different!  Anyway, I am looking for the <br/>
best place to find curriculum for Justin.  I have found some online <br/>
courses through South Carolina Virtual School; however, he can only <br/>
take three credits per year, and he wishes to do more.  Can anyone give <br/>
me any information.<br/>
<br/>
Your help is greatly appreciated!<br/>

This might not be the group you&#39;re looking for. We don&#39;t use <br/>
curricula---just life and all it offers. &lt;g&gt; We&#39;re UNschoolers! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

I just got your membership application for SOS, so you will be getting <br/>

But you&#39;re welcome to call me to talk more about what&#39;s necessary in SC <br/>
in order to homeschool.<br/>

Well, technically, if the child wants curricular material, it is<br/>
appropriate.~~<br/>
<br/>
No, not always. That one is a big, huge IT DEPENDS.<br/>
<br/>
If a child thinks that is the best way to learn, or has been<br/>
brainwashed by the school system or schoolish parents, it might pay to<br/>
invest some time helping them find multiple paths to what they want.<br/>
Or spend time helping them HEAL from that damage so they can see that<br/>
curriculum is one of the WORST ways to learn most anything!!<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s important to invest time in helping a child trust the<br/>
natural learning process, helping them explore the exciting world we<br/>
live in, help them find new and interesting EXPERIENCES rather than<br/>
just shoving a curriculum at them as a first response.<br/>
<br/>
My nephew is going to high school this year. As a radically unschooled<br/>
kiddo, his experience is vastly different from that of a child that<br/>
thinks they need school to learn. <br/>
<br/>
Curriculum is not designed to help a learner get what they need for<br/>
the most part, it is designed to put information inside of another<br/>
person, something that never works. As a partial tool, it can be O.K.<br/>
(not great, but ok). If a learner believes it is the best way to learn<br/>
a new skill or validate an interest, they are sadly mistaken.<br/>
<br/>
There are reasons an unschooler might use curriculum, including a<br/>
desire to attend college. But that isn&#39;t what this mother asked about<br/>
and this list is here to help people UNSCHOOL, not find curriculum.<br/>

is, though.<br/>
<br/>
Once a parent understands unschooling, once a child is over their own  <br/>
need to do school, it&#39;s obvious that whatever way a child wants to  <br/>
explore something is unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
But a child coming out of school will want curriculum for different  <br/>
reasons than a  long time unschooling child.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1911667738">I had a BUNCH of unschoolers over to my house last March (and we&#39;ll <br/>
have another big group here this next weekend---Amy Steinberg, <br/>
anyone?), and someone came downstairs and called me on the mat. <br/>
Laughing at all the textbooks and workbooks  and reference books we had <br/>
in an upstairs bookshelf. Like it was this big joke that *I* had such <br/>
things in my house. My high school Latin books, my college Greek and <br/>
German books, biology, physics, and chemistry books by the tons, <br/>
history texts---all made for some good ribbing that weekend. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that unschooling homes *don&#39;t* have these things; it&#39;s just <br/>
that their importance doesn&#39;t overshadow the importance of tv and video <br/>
games and fencing equipment and trampolines and drumsets and decks of <br/>
cards. All equal in importance to learning.<br/>
<br/>
Had *I* been unschooled, I would have probably been a very &quot;academic&quot; <br/>
unschooler. I would have been drawn to Latin and Greek and physics and <br/>
grammar and WWII and literature naturally. And I *was*. I would have <br/>
been drawn to certain curricula---I think I would have LOVED _The <br/>
Well-Trained Mind_. I *do* love _The Well-Trained Mind_! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But I would not consider pushing a curriculum on a child to be <br/>
unschooling. If a child chooses, on his own, to work through a certain <br/>
curriculum, super! But to choose a curriculum and expect a child to do <br/>
it joyfully in order to &quot;get an education&quot; is not a good <br/>
expectation---and it&#39;s not unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Because unschooling is about learning from the whole wide world and <br/>
because texts and curricula are *parts* of the whole wide world, it&#39;s <br/>
reasonable to believe that a child would be interested in following a <br/>
curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
And although all unschooling IS homeschooling, all homeschooling is not <br/>
necessarily UNschooling. (All poodles are dogs, but not all dogs are <br/>
poodles.)<br/>

hi, kali. you might want to try _www.globalvillageschool.org_ <br/>
(http://www.globalvillageschool.org)  . they  have a lovely, unschooling minded (i know that <br/>
can seem a misnomer, lol) group  of online classes and you can be full time or <br/>
just a class or two. it was a good  transition from conventional education to <br/>
home to unschooling fir us. my son  fell in love with the Buddhist Class. <br/>
