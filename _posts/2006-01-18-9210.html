<div id="ygrps-yiv-487994247">Hi,<br/>
Sorry to cross post but my kids have a question.  They want to watch the Star Wars series of movies & they want to know where to start & if you all have a list of all the Star War movies.<br/>
<br/>
And help would be great.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1245197383">Hmm they could do it in release order in which case it&#39;s:<br/>
Episode 4 A New Hope<br/>
Episode 5 Empire Strikes Back<br/>
Episode 6 Return of the Jedi<br/>
Episode 1 The Phantom Menace<br/>
Episode 2 Attack of the Clones<br/>
Episode 3 Revenge of the Sith<br/>
<br/>
OR they could just do them in numerical order 1-6. There are pluses <br/>
and minuses to both. We (DH and I) saw the first 3 (4-6) way back when <br/>
then 1-3 as they came out. DS saw them 1, 4-6, 2, 3 (since after <br/>
seeing the first one he wanted to see all the rest). And we&#39;ve since <br/>
watched them all in order (when Episode 3 hit DVD, we bought it then <br/>
did a series, one per night for a week per DS&#39; request). We also have <br/>
Thumb Wars and Spaceballs (both of which rely heavily on Star Wars). <br/>
And we have Lego Star Wars video game for the PS2.<br/>
<br/>
I would note that if you have younger or sensitive kids, you might <br/>
want to screen episode 3 ahead of time - there are several &#39;difficult&#39; <br/>
scenes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-735924985">I HIGHLY recommend watching episode 4 first.  It has the strongest story<br/>
line of the lot, but if you watch the others ahead of it, you will be<br/>
disappointed by the &quot;primitive&quot; special effects and slow lightsaber duels<br/>
(obiwan and vader don&#39;t do much besides shake their weapons at eachother).<br/>
Also, the revelation of luke and vader&#39;s relationship is something you DON&#39;T<br/>
want to spoil!<br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents...<br/>

Clones--it fills in all the back story between Episode II and III.<br/>
<br/>
I would totally recommend screening III as well; Sam and Jules both had <br/>
major issues with it even though I tried to prepare them. I knew there <br/>
was no way we could see it in the theater, but even home it was too intense.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-364731827">Thanks for the screening recommendation. I have a couple who probably won&#39;t <br/>
want to watch that episode.    I&#39;ll make sure to have something they feel <br/>
more comfortable watching set up in the other room.<br/>

Thanks to everyone who sent me the list of movies :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We saw episode 3 at the drive in originally (well, Dh and I saw it <br/>
at the theater on opening night - FIL had gotten his hands on free <br/>
passes but he never goes to the theater - DS had already said that <br/>
he wanted to wait until it was at the drive in not in the movie <br/>
theater because it looked like it would be too loud and scary in the <br/>
theater). Due to the nature of drive in theaters, DS fell asleep <br/>
about halfway through the climactic battle on Mustafar. He&#39;s seen <br/>
episode 3 in its entirety at home since then a couple of times. <br/>
Something that helps him with stuff like this is that I&#39;m kind of <br/>
squirmy about it too so I&#39;ll cover my eyes when I know something is <br/>
coming up and he can hide with me or watch or a little of both, <br/>
sometimes I&#39;ll peek through my fingers and he&#39;ll peek through his <br/>
fingers and we&#39;ll peek at each other and grin until the rough part <br/>
is over.<br/>
