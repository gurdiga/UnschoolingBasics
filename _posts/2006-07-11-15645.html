<div id="ygrps-yiv-1987199225">The 2 hours of volunteer time can be anything or for any non-profit.  You<br/>
can do computer work for a non profit organization for 2 hours a month, and<br/>
that qualifies.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-673214190">In our state (MA), the volunteering can be as simple as helping out an elderly neighbor, helping out the Girl Scout or Boy Scout troop that your kids are in, or volunteering at the Y....in other words, look at what you are already doing and I bet it is much more that 2 hours of volunteer work per month that&#39;s required.<br/>

doctor&#39;s appointment (which you may already be doing anyhow) or <br/>
picking up some groceries or bringing soup to a sick neighbor. It can <br/>
ALSO include volunteering AT the food share place - sorting and <br/>
stacking produce etc right that same day as when you pick it up - <br/>
you&#39;d just get there a few hours early, put in your time, then leave <br/>
with your groceries.<br/>
