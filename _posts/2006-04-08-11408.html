<div id="ygrps-yiv-1475167274">My 2 year old LOVES his magnetix - which apparently have been recalled<br/>
and are dangerous...<br/>
<br/>
But my questions is... does anyone have these?<br/>
<br/>

They look pretty cool. Also, what is another brand of a &quot;magnetix&quot;<br/>
type toy that is better? The Rose Art ones have discolored and the<br/>
magnets do fall out after a while.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The original magnetic building toy is the Geomag.  They are MUCH more<br/>
expensive.  We have both Geomag and Magnetix.  We aren&#39;t returning our<br/>
Magnetix (not that we could find them all anyway as they have gotten<br/>
scattered and are in the bottoms of drawers, boxes, bins and the sofa<br/>
cushions LOL!)  While Magnetix magnets are just glued into a plastic<br/>
cylinder the Geomag magnets have their casing molded around them.  We also<br/>
noticed that the Geomag&#39;s look nicer after a while and are stronger.  I<br/>
think the $14.99 size box of Magnetix  is equivelant to a $30.00 size box of<br/>
Geomags.  We haven&#39;t lost any magnets from our Magnetix yet and they are<br/>
played with often.<br/>

I was so happy to see your post.  Last week when I took my 2.5 yo dd to the<br/>
dollar store to buy toys for our no candy egg hunt she picked out the $1<br/>
store equivalent of magnetix.  Before she even had a chance to play with<br/>
them my husband saw them and deemed them as to big of a choking risk for her<br/>
to play with.  Yes, my daughter still puts things in her mouth, and may<br/>
until she&#39;s 5 yo.  I was glad to see your post and I plan to share it with<br/>
my dh to show him that even though it says ages 3 and up 2yo can enjoy them<br/>
too.  I was also glad to hear that even the name brand ones have the magnets<br/>
come out.  DH gets so irritated that I buy &quot;crappy&quot; toys at the $1 store for<br/>
dd.  If you decide to get the bigger ones that you posted let me know how ds<br/>
reacts to them.  (and vice versa.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-106719699">Just FYI...They are trying to recall the magnetics. My kids had them too.  The world news told of 3 children, 2 who have died, not from choking on them, but swallowing them. The strong magnetic force caused their bowels to twist and become occluded.  Neither could be saved with surgery.  Be careful.<br/>
