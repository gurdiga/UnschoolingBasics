Happy, secure, healthy lives are more at the root of unschooling; not<br/>
college for college sake.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>*** Unschooling works in every language! Having an ASL  fluent &quot;coach&quot; would<br/>
defeat many of the accessibility hurdles to experiencing the world: as a<br/>
language model, as an interpreter, as an advocate. That&#39;s pretty much what<br/>
we&#39;re all doing for our kids :D The experience of freedom is the experience<br/>
of freedom, your individual life may look quite different than another<br/>
unschoolers, the principles driving your experience are the same.<br/>
<br/>
Are you in school now? Mainstreamed? Skilled Interpreters? Is being<br/>
unschooled a possibility? (how cool!) Have you read The Teenage Liberation<br/>
Handboook? (you should!)<br/>

<br/>
hi all.<br/>
<br/>

Never say &quot;only.&quot; Your age is a good thing! :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
i have a few questions.<br/>
<br/>
1) why doesn&#39;t paying me to do  chores teach me about the real world?<br/>
*I* think it can help support - bigger, more extended chores vs. the  normal, <br/>
daily family stuff that needs to get done. Painting the house or washing  the <br/>
car or some such thing like that, *I* would offer payment for a job. I see  <br/>
that as work, and a person is always worthy of their hire, I feel. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2) is making a decision for me in order to put pressure on me to go  to<br/>
college okay?<br/>
 <br/>
No, not to me it isn&#39;t. Can you go into details? <br/>
<br/>
3) and finally... i&#39;m deaf. if any of you unschooled me, how would  you<br/>
go about doing it?<br/>
 <br/>
The same way I am now, with my hearing kids. Books, TV (closed captioning  is <br/>
on often here anyway - <br/>
I read abut that here I think it was, that hearing the TV and seeing the  <br/>
words at the same time can be a neat way to see words in action, so I do that  <br/>
when Julian wants to), movies, going places, card games, drawing...I truly feel  <br/>
that that aspect is the same...however, as with any situation that is above <br/>
and  beyond the average, lol, sometimes things need to be tweaked for each  <br/>
individual. If you were my child, and interested in this, I&#39;d suggest hunting  <br/>
down other unschooled kids that are deaf too. <br/>
