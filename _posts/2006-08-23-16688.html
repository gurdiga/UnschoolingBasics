<div id="ygrps-yiv-1414995211">&quot;Would love some input on a basic unschooling<br/>
day.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That will look so different from family to family! I think a great way<br/>
to get a feel for day-to-day stuff is to read at unschoolers blogs. If<br/>
you visit our &quot;links&quot; here at the site, there are a LOT of blogs<br/>
listed to peruse.<br/>
<br/>
I was just reading all the funshop presenters for the Live and Learn<br/>
conference today and sat here thinking &quot;WOW, there are SO many cool<br/>
and interesting people that unschool.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I already knew that...truly. But to have so many descriptions in one<br/>
place reminds you of what a hugely diverse mass of people unschoolers<br/>
are. Very cool.<br/>
