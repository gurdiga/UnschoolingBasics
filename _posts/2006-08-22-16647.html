<div id="ygrps-yiv-2052400767">Hi, <br/>
I thought I&#39;d post this on another topic. <br/>
I have always wanted to start a homebased business so that we wouldn&#39;t <br/>
have such a tight budget. But I thought that it would be great to do <br/>
with the kids, they would have a way to make money, and if they liked <br/>
it they would have a business to take over someday! <br/>
<br/>
But I really have had a hard time coming up with ideas! I would  love <br/>
to do bakery-but we have pets in our house so working in our home is <br/>
out. I think we could rent a church kitchen or something-but with my 3 <br/>
yo and 4yo- I don&#39;t think we are ready for that yet. <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any ideas about this? Especially businesses that the <br/>
kids could be involved in?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Cathy</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-730861733">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
What about since you have animals in your house,<br/>
walking dogs for a business?  I know it sounds silly,<br/>
but think of all the poor dogs, stuck in<br/>
cages/kennels/crates all day, while the owners are<br/>
working?  Or maybe a dog bathing company.  Something<br/>
you could offer to people living in your area.  Just a<br/>
thought.<br/>

contemplating doing again. Why are you thinking you<br/>
can&#39;t have pets? Have you contacted the BOH already<br/>
and they said no? ELISA<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1718391278">Yeah, baking might be tough with health code type issues and all. <br/>
How about soaps? I know someone on another list who makes jewelweed <br/>
soap (natural remedy for poison ivy). Taking a page from her book, I <br/>
made some this year (we&#39;ve got LOTS of jewelweed, lots of poison ivy <br/>
and my siblings are very allergic to it). It cost me roughly 50 <br/>
cents per bar to make using a store bought glycerin base and the <br/>
jewelweed I cut out in the yard (not including time, and even then <br/>
it was minimal). It cost a little for the molds I bought (though you <br/>
CAN use things like tuna cans and old yogurt containers and such) <br/>
but the molds are reusable. Factoring it all in, it cost maybe $1 or <br/>
so to make each bar and it can sell for $2-$4 per bar on the open <br/>
market. Getting additional supplies (colorings, scents, etc) would <br/>
run more but again, would not add much on a per bar basis when it is <br/>
factored over how much you get out of it. Cutting wildflowers or <br/>
holding a basket for cuttings is something small kids can do and I&#39;m <br/>
sure there are other things they could be involved in, if you chose <br/>
to make colorful labels or wrappings and such - maybe putting the <br/>
finished soaps into small gift bags for example. Flea markets and <br/>
craft fairs would be good places to both get ideas as to the market <br/>
AND potentially set up shop on occasion. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2011937325">You know, those are some great ideas! Thank-you! I&#39;ll have to ask the <br/>
kids what they think of all this! I especially like the idea about <br/>
taking care of animals in their own home-that&#39;s a service I would love <br/>
to have for myself!<br/>

Thanks, you all have got my wheels moving!<br/>

Cameron house/pet sits and makes a good deal of $$. He stays IN the <br/>
house overnight though, so he can charge a little more. He has about a <br/>
dozen clients. They keep him pretty busy! It&#39;s also a good transition <br/>
for *me*! &lt;g&gt; He stays overnight for several days: I&#39;m getting used to <br/>
what it&#39;ll be like when he moves out (ugh! &lt;g&gt;). And house-sitting <br/>
allows him to work at his other jobs at the same time---because he <br/>
doesn&#39;t have to IN the house 24/7. He&#39;s just there early am when the <br/>
pets get breakfast and late afternoon when they get supper, and he <br/>
makes sure they&#39;re let out first thing in the morning, last thing at <br/>
night, and several times during the day---just like with our own dogs. <br/>
Easy!<br/>
<br/>
Another job that is terribly underrated is pooper-scooping. Even the <br/>
smallest kid can get into the act! Check it out online---it&#39;s starting <br/>
to be a BIG business!<br/>
