<div id="ygrps-yiv-1663555993">We&#39;re (all of us as a family) at the point now where we have more free <br/>
time to do the things we want around the house and one of the areas <br/>
that we&#39;d like to get started on is the back yard. <br/>
I&#39;ve been looking/asking around online and getting lots of ideas. One <br/>
of the ideas someone gave me that I *love* is a graffiti wall!<br/>
Before someone suggests asking my kids, I did. :-) Sadly, their <br/>
imaginations have been squashed by years of foster care and public <br/>
schooling. <br/>
We really want to make our yard a fun & creative place. The fun part <br/>
is covered (inground pool, jacuzzi, 14&#39; trampoling, huge wooden <br/>
playset, dirtbike), it&#39;s the creative, imaginative things we&#39;re <br/>
getting a little stuck on. <br/>
Any ideas would be appreciated. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2075599406">&quot;it&#39;s the creative, imaginative things we&#39;re<br/>
getting a little stuck on.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My kids would think your yard was fabulous, seeing as it has a <br/>
pool!:)<br/>
<br/>
My Mom had this idea about creating a &quot;storygarden&quot; at the library <br/>
she worked at (as a librarian and storyteller). She was so <br/>
enthusiastic about it and shared a lot of ideas with me.  After she <br/>
died, the storygarden did get created and named in her honor...<br/>
Anyway (I&#39;m getting to the point, really) this inspired me to want a <br/>
garden in my yard that was geared for children and exploration.<br/>
<br/>
I started searching with the idea of a storygarden/kids garden and <br/>
here&#39;s the list I came up with a while back:<br/>
<br/>
~Sundial area<br/>
~water play/construction area (a lower down workbench built out of <br/>
wood, some kind of large garden tub with pouring, mixing tools)<br/>
~low down pergola or archway, covered with vines <br/>
~&quot;story&quot; tree- a weeping tree of some kind next to the pond<br/>
~Pebble/rock area- many different size stones, gravel and rock for <br/>
stacking, pouring etc...<br/>
~&quot;council ring&quot;- a natural built teepee or fort for gatherings<br/>
~picnic bench<br/>
~ edible garden boxes -all flowers, herbs and salad that kids can <br/>
eat while sitting in garden.<br/>
~Log &quot;bridge&quot;- big, dead log to lay down for them to climb on or use <br/>
as a bridge over one area<br/>
~bamboo forest- buy a clumping variety so it doesn&#39;t take over the <br/>
whole yard!<br/>
~Bird and bat houses, bird feeders/baths etc...<br/>
~Butterfly garden- grow plants that they love to eat like milkweed, <br/>
mimosa, impatiens etc..<br/>
~Dinosaur (or treasure) dig area- a large sandbox where  you bury <br/>
things for them to excavate<br/>
~Earthworm bin -raise red worms for the garden, the kids can feed <br/>
them food scraps and watch their population grow<br/>
~Build fairy houses and place them throughout yard/garden area<br/>
~Large rocks arranged like stepping stones, to jump across<br/>
~Grow a sunflower house<br/>
~build a low fence and let them paint their handprints on it<br/>
~Hang chimes, lanterns etc... for day and night magic<br/>
~build large, whimsical sculptures<br/>
~create a zen garden, for quiet meditation (my latest project)<br/>
<br/>
And of course a pond. I plan to create mine with very shallow areas <br/>
for placing toes into.:) We&#39;ll start with a smallish one, then add <br/>
on each year hopefully. Ponds are great for exploration and if you <br/>
live in a colder area, there are heaters you can place in them to <br/>
keep it from freezing solid.<br/>
<br/>
Our last house was very small and on a city lot. We were fortunate <br/>
to have a large, natural pond in back, but we still created a small <br/>
water garden out of a tub bought from Lowes. We had so much fun <br/>
watching tadpoles and frogs and dragonflies. I think natural water <br/>
areas are really great.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I&#39;ve dreamed of doing, is to build a cob house in the back <br/>
yard that looks like a house from the Shire (think Bilbo). It would <br/>
be small, with a loft, for quiet, dreaming time or art exploration.:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1861146105">Interestingly enough, the topic of &quot;school&quot; rooms came up at UD <br/>
(ooh, yucky) and Danielle Conger posted a link to a lovely article <br/>
she wrote a while back. I hadn&#39;t read it for a time, so I enjoyed it <br/>
all over again.<br/>
I thought you might like this part:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;This attitude extends to our near-acre property, where we make use <br/>
of every bit of land to enrich our lives. My passion for gardening <br/>
has led to the complete relandscaping of our property to include <br/>
vegetable gardens, berry gardens, herb gardens, flower gardens, <br/>
wildlife gardens and a 3200 gallon water garden. Throughout the <br/>
growing season, my children and I harvest lettuce, beans, <br/>
blackberries, strawberries, tomatoes and basil among many other <br/>
delicacies. <br/>
<br/>
We plant dill especially for the black swallowtails that flutter <br/>
through our yard on which to lay their eggs.  We plant native <br/>
flowers and shrubs to feed the wildlife and nurture those that <br/>
spring up on their own. The native spicebush leaves turn a beautiful <br/>
yellow in the fall after hosting spicebush swallowtail caterpillars <br/>
throughout the summer, then give way to glossy red berries, feeding <br/>
the birds that overwinter here. <br/>
<br/>
Our pond, home to koi and comets, attracts many species of <br/>
dragonflies as well as black snails, numerous frogs and the <br/>
occasional snake and boxturtle. This past spring, we purchased <br/>
twelve rare breed chicks to raise for fresh eggs, designing and <br/>
building the chicken house and yard that protect them from local <br/>
wildlife and our family dog so that it rotates frequently enough to <br/>
allow free range grazing. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re learning all about organic gardening, different ecosystems, <br/>
wildlife and animal care, and our landscape reflects the fervor of <br/>
our passions and our pursuit of learning through life. As <br/>
Unschoolers, however, we do these things not because of the many <br/>
wonderful learning opportunities they provide but because we follow <br/>
our passions with abandon. &quot;<br/>

really missing out! She&#39;s a huge inspiration to me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1680645772">Ren, your description sounds absolutely beautiful! We are looking at two places with two acres of land each. One is further from &quot;town&quot; but has a stocked pond, and a couple willow trees already (and is a larger house with 7 bedrooms!! the other is closer to &quot;town&quot; and family but is a 4 bedroom). You&#39;ve given me some ideas for the yard, which ever place we might end up - either in one of these two places or another. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1174353517">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; We&#39;re (all of us as a family) at the point now where we have more free <br/>
time to do the things we want around the house and one of the areas <br/>
that we&#39;d like to get started on is the back yard.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One of the things that I remember from my childhood was that my<br/>
grandfather&#39;s garden had some &quot;secret&quot; places - spots where the shrubs grew<br/>
together and then had surprise clear spaces behind them that were small -<br/>
almost like a small maze. It was great for all kinds of role playing games -<br/>
hiding from pirates etc. Kids like parts of gardens that are divided up, as<br/>
well as big space for running. My neighbor had an overturned row boat in the<br/>
yard that we used as a play hideout.<br/>
<br/>
One of Jayn&#39;s favorite places is the Huntington Gardens Children&#39;s Garden in<br/>
Pasadena. They have low level water features with smooth stones to rub, a<br/>
short tunnel, fragrant herbs to rub, a carnivorous plant section to watch,<br/>
and a couple of structures made of metal with vines growing over - a play<br/>
house, a teepee. <br/>
<br/>
Another garden that she loves has tunnels made of saplings tied together,<br/>
and a tiny &quot;forest&quot; clearing with a kid size picnic table. Also a stream<br/>
with a bunch of driftwood to climb on. She likes the reflective spinners in<br/>
the tree branches too.<br/>
<br/>
I suggest visiting some public gardens and children&#39;s museums in your area<br/>
to get ideas.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-238696523">Thank you (and your mom!) for all the great ideas Ren! We have <br/>
almost an acre (which is large compared to what we had in NYC!!)<br/>
I&#39;m also looking forward to getting started gardening (we want to <br/>
grow herbs and veggies) but we&#39;ll wait a bit to get started with <br/>
that. Right now we can only manage non-living things. LOL!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>
If anybody has any other ideas that don&#39;t involve gardening, please <br/>
share!<br/>
