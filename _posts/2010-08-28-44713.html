<div id="ygrps-yiv-1970081322">Greetings! I love stories like this-our son 14, decided to learn Japanese<br/>
this way! He&#39;s been practicing nearly every day for just over a month<br/>
without me saying anything, just quizzing him when he asks.  I have no idea<br/>
how long the interest will last, but simply watching this happen has been<br/>
amazing.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for sharing your joyful experience,<br/>
<br/>
Blessings and peace,<br/>
Quinn<br/>
