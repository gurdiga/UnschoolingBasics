So here&#39;s an even better thing for your daughter -- one of the courses they  <br/>
offer is:<br/>
 <br/>
Biology 195: Introduction to Marine Life (3) <br/>
This course covers general aspects of  marine biology, including the <br/>
principles of physical and biological  oceanography, the biological processes of <br/>
marine life and the ecology of marine  environments. At the conclusion of the <br/>
course, students will be able  to:<br/>
--Describe the diversity of life in marine systems,<br/>
--Discuss  biological processes and ecological concepts relevant to <br/>
individuals,  populations, and communities in the world&#39;s oceans, and <br/>
--Explain how human  interactions have affected marine populations, as well <br/>
as whaling policies,  pollution, habitat restoration and conservation. <br/>
It&#39;s not offered this Spring, but probably in the fall. Julian took it and it <br/>
 was fun to listen to the lectures and it was pretty easy.  <br/>
This spring they have Introduction to Music, Individual and Society, and  <br/>
Film, Television and Theatre. (Truthfully, Julian started the Film one and it  <br/>
was so horribly boring he dropped it. We were astonished that the topic could be <br/>
 boring, but there it was. Your mileage may vary.) <br/>
Don&#39;t stress the &quot;B&quot; student thing. They were pretty open. <br/>

 <br/>
Write in that you&#39;re homeschoolers somewhere. Just do your best. The first  <br/>
time we registered I had to talk to the woman (Joy Something?) organizing it to <br/>
 assure her that the colleges J was thinking about applying to would accept <br/>
the  credits. They&#39;re pretty basic courses, so generally colleges will. If your <br/>
kid  has no idea about what colleges just say something like Goddard will <br/>
accept  them. (For that matter, we found that Harvard would have, depending on  <br/>
major.)<br/>
