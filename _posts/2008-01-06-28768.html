<div id="ygrps-yiv-1697685499">My name is Dawn Michaels and you may or may not know the Kraft<br/>
family. Ruth is a wonderful friend of mine who has a beautiful<br/>
daughter, Emma who is 7 and her son Jacob who is 6. Ruth is a<br/>
compassionate and loving person who works as a doula and as a<br/>
photographer. You can learn more about her here at her website -<br/>
www.HonoringWomen.com.<br/>
<br/>
On January 3rd they lost their home, 2 of their pets and all of their<br/>
belongings to a fire. They are in a motel for the next 5 days thanks<br/>
to the Red Cross - with only the clothes on their backs. I honestly<br/>
can&#39;t imagine what they must be going thru.<br/>
<br/>
They need everything and I think we can all help.<br/>
<br/>
What they need the most right now is your prayers  please take a<br/>
moment and see them at peace, cared for and protected by Gods grace.<br/>
<br/>
What else they need right now is financial assistance and I have set<br/>
up a PayPal account for them at KraftFamilyRecovery@.... I<br/>
know that they will appreciate all help of any size from $10 to $1000<br/>
or more. www.PayPal.com.<br/>

love your help with other donations. The most urgent help needed is<br/>

<br/>
Emma has a doctors appt a few minutes from me on Tuesday  I would<br/>
love to offer them some clothes by noon on Tuesday. I know its short<br/>
notice but I know we can help. Please go thru your closets today and<br/>

blessed and the smallest gifts from each of us will lighten the<br/>
hearts, minds and souls of this precious family.<br/>

<br/>
Here is their wishlist:<br/>
<br/>
Gift cards to Target, Walmart and Publix<br/>
<br/>
Emma -<br/>
<br/>
size 7/8 clothes - she is special needs and would prefer pants that<br/>
do not need to be buttoned or anything that needs a lot of fine motor<br/>
skills.<br/>
<br/>
shoes need to be specially fitted at stride rite, so gift cards would<br/>
be best.<br/>
<br/>
socks to for a size 2 shoe , knee highs preferably so they fit under<br/>
her leg brace.<br/>
<br/>
She loves curious George, the one she had laughs when you tickle its<br/>
chin.<br/>
<br/>
dvds would be great to pass the time in a hotel room with no toys.<br/>
<br/>
She loves Dora the explorer and pbs kids. and anything creative.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Jacob<br/>
<br/>
size 5/6<br/>
<br/>
wears a shoe 10.5 or 11.<br/>
<br/>
He loves cars, animals, dvds, and especially Thomas the train.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They could use a couple blankets and pillows, towels, wash clothes,<br/>
storage bins to store things but small enough for extra clothing but<br/>
easy enough to move around from place to place. Duffle bags, rolling<br/>
suitcases etc.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The kids lost all their Christmas presents. It would be great to see<br/>
if we can replace any of these:<br/>
<br/>
They had 2 mini children&#39;s portable DVD players with 4 inch screens<br/>
to watch dvds on ,<br/>
<br/>
books or activity books that are interactive.<br/>
<br/>
Jacob would like another iPod<br/>
<br/>
and a Charlottes web movie . DVD&#39;s that are for kids and not scary<br/>
would be best.<br/>
<br/>
any small hand held games like Pac man, game boy, whatever, as long<br/>
as it doesn&#39;t take up a lot of room.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ruth could use:<br/>
<br/>
new clothes and shoes. She prefers lane Bryant ( lanebryant.com) and<br/>
avenue ( avenue.com ) stores.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has a laptop they aren&#39;t using or could lend and a printer<br/>
with ink So she can start printing advertising materials that were<br/>
lost for her business.<br/>
<br/>
She also would like journals to write in,<br/>
<br/>
a small cd player,<br/>
<br/>
She has a Verizon lg phone that is rectangular and could really use a<br/>
charger for her phone that plugs into a wall<br/>
<br/>
some comfortable sandals or shoes in size 10 wide.<br/>
<br/>
her flavia day planner in a case is lost as well.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Michael:<br/>
<br/>
wears size 32/32 or 32/30 and could use clothing,<br/>
<br/>
large shirts<br/>
<br/>
a jacket ( large )<br/>
<br/>
socks and<br/>
<br/>
shoes size 8.<br/>
<br/>
an electric razor,<br/>
