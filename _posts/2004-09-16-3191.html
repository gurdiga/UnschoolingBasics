<div id="ygrps-yiv-165492578"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; When she has an angry blasting meltdown, I let Jayn&#39;s anger just bounce off<br/>
&gt; me, like a beach ball you aren&#39;t catching - it will get less (or impinge on<br/>
&gt; you less). I&#39;m talking about &quot;detachment&quot; from her emotions, NOT ignoring<br/>
&gt; her or her requests. Just not allowing her frenzy to get me upset, while<br/>
&gt; still validating emotions back - &quot;you sound very angry/frustrated&quot;. She will<br/>
&gt; go on and I will say something very neutral like &quot;What a shame.&quot; It helps<br/>
&gt; her go through the meltdown, and restore her own balance. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sometimes I also remind Jayn to take some deep breaths if she is starting to<br/>
&gt; get angry. Sometimes her only relief is still to shriek. One good one and<br/>
&gt; she is often better.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Robyn, This is such good advice! And it does help! There have been many times I&#39;ve let <br/>
Ella&#39;s meltdowns trigger meltdowns in me too! I consider myself &quot;highly sensitive&quot; and the <br/>
screaming REALLY pushes my buttons and has often led to me being the one screaming! I <br/>
am learning, however, to say and mean &quot;Yes&quot; to <br/>
her more (which has helped tremendously with the meltdowns caused by frustration) and <br/>
then to just accept her anger and not get <br/>
angry myself. I also love what you said about not expecting &quot;respect&quot; from our kids. <br/>
Respect is modeled from us - she&#39;ll get it someday. And quite frankly I believe she is <br/>
trying out certain &quot;disrespectful&quot; behaviors she is picking up from TV&#39;s protrayal of kids <br/>
and other kids she knows. I need to just let her know that those ways of speaking can <br/>
sometimes hurt feelings.<br/>
