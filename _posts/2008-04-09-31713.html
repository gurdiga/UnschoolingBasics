My 9 year old really wants one. As all kids, he is good at some things and<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-885646528">What exactly would the reason be to *not* allow your child a cell phone?<br/>
Could these issues be discussed and addressed with the child?  I certainly<br/>
understand if there are budget issues though I think these can generally be<br/>
tossed around and the money likely found in all but the most dire of<br/>
financial circumstances- it&#39;s usually quite affordable to add another line<br/>
to an existing contract- but of course as a family you may decide there are<br/>
other priorities. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
That said, none of my children has their own cell phone.  My 8yo has<br/>
mentioned wanting her own phone in passing (kind of like mentioning wanting<br/>
her own pony), but I don&#39;t think she fully comprehends that we&#39;d still have<br/>
the same number of minutes to share so it wouldn&#39;t change the fact that we<br/>
have to watch our calling during the &quot;work week&quot;.  We have a fairly tight<br/>
budget ourselves and we&#39;ve never had the full discussion.   We do want to<br/>
provide a phone for our 13yo as he begins to stay home alone more, and may<br/>
venture out on his own more, but it also may work out to fit everyone&#39;s<br/>
needs better if we&#39;d just get a land line hooked up again (we&#39;re cell only).<br/>
So far the main need for Logan is to have a phone for safety reasons when<br/>
he&#39;s home alone and Ayden&#39;s main wish is to have unlimited calling to her<br/>
friends any time she wants it.  We&#39;ll just have to see how it plays out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-259927827">We bought one for our oldest when he turned 13, and he lost it after  <br/>
two weeks. However, that&#39;s why we got the pay as you go phone, $20  <br/>
with 250 minutes, and while it&#39;s a little more expensive per minute,  <br/>
if it&#39;s lost, no biggie. We plan on getting another one, but  <br/>
expectations will be a bit different (ie have a central plug in place  <br/>
so it doesn&#39;t get set down anywhere else) The whole point was so that  <br/>
*I* felt comfortable when he was out with friends, so we could split  <br/>
up easily at the mall and find each other when we want to, and call  <br/>
me when he&#39;s done at scouts/library etc.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-37922232">So far two of my four kids have cell phones(17 and 14 yr olds have<br/>
them 13 and 6 yr old don&#39;t).... for us it wasn&#39;t an arbitrary age but<br/>
either us realizing they had a need for one or them asking for one.  <br/>
When I say &quot;need&quot; I mean when I realized that I was dropping them off<br/>
for this or that more and more and that they may have a need to call<br/>
me or for me to call them (I&#39;m running late or hey mom can you pick me<br/>
up from so and so&#39;s house instead of where we had planned)   Also I<br/>
wanted to make sure if they were ever somewhere they felt<br/>
unsafe/uncomfortable they could call me without asking someone for the<br/>
use of a phone.   My 13 yr old (ok she&#39;ll be 13 in 15 more minutes!) <br/>
hasn&#39;t asked for one but because of some things in her life that are<br/>
difficult for her developmentally (she has a genetic syndrome and<br/>
autism)  to master we will most likely purchase one for her soon so<br/>
she can carry it with her when she goes out into the community with<br/>
her developmental aide both for safety and just growing accustomed to<br/>
using a phone independently.   <br/>
Some kids just want one and perhaps don&#39;t really need one.. in those<br/>
cases I would decide financially whether I could get one for them,<br/>
whether they would need to share in the expense by using birthday<br/>
money or whatever.  <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t say we have ever been a situation with any of ours that them<br/>
having a phone was a negative thing.   Neither of mine have run up<br/>
huge bills or lost their phones.   I will say that you should make<br/>
sure to inform them of what features on their phones will cost &quot;extra&quot;<br/>
if used... my niece had a huge bill her first month because she didn&#39;t<br/>
know that surfing the web and texting wasn&#39;t included in her<br/>
plan...she thought if it worked then it was ok.   My brother got a<br/>
really big bill and after they figured out what made it so high he<br/>
added unlimited texting and asked her to only use the web surfing<br/>
feature if she really needed to (for directions or some other<br/>
immediate need)   <br/>
<br/>
I try not to attach &quot;are they mature enough&quot; to things like this<br/>
because they may not be (in our judgment) but how do they learn to<br/>
navigate the world if no one ever gives them the chance to try out new<br/>
things or take those big steps to independence.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1433490326">LOL I&#39;ve actually ASKED my almost 10 yr old DS once or twice over the<br/>
last year or two if he wanted a cell phone (we&#39;d get one of those pay as<br/>
you go inexpensive types most likely for a starter phone, I&#39;d already<br/>
checked it out and was ready to go get it if he said yes). He thought a<br/>
minute and said Nah, I don&#39;t really need one right now. I think it<br/>
really depends on the kids and the situation - I think if DS was out and<br/>
about a whole lot more without me or DH, he might want one but as it is,<br/>
he&#39;s always got access to one anyhow (DH and I have our cellphones<br/>
programmed so that the same speed dial number calls the opposite phone -<br/>
if I hit 2, it calls DH, if he hits 2 it calls me - makes it simple for<br/>
DS to contact whoever he&#39;s not with at the time).<br/>

When Cameron got his driver&#39;s license, my father gave him a cell phone. <br/>
Daddy pays the monthly fee too, and he&#39;s paid it for what? five years <br/>
now, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
There was a little difficulty at first with LOTS of calls, so Daddy <br/>
gave him unlimited calling. Then the texting started, so Daddy got him <br/>
unlimited texting. &lt;g&gt; Now it&#39;s all ironed out. He may choose to stop <br/>
paying once Cameron is 21 or in his own house--hard to tell. But it&#39;s <br/>
been good for both of them.<br/>
<br/>
For a long time, Cameron was the only one with a phone. Two years ago, <br/>
I gave Ben (and me) Valentine&#39;s phones. Ben rides his bicycle to and <br/>
 from work every day, and I wanted him to be able to call me if he had a <br/>
flat tire or was in trouble. It&#39;s paid for itself already. Neither of <br/>
us uses our phones all that much, but they&#39;re handy. We have zillions <br/>
of unused minutes every month, and they rollover. I&#39;d like to get a <br/>
&quot;fewer calls&quot; plan, but this company doesn&#39;t allow that unless they&#39;re <br/>
running a special of some kind.<br/>
<br/>
Last year, I gave Duncan (12, then 11) one for his birthday. It has <br/>
free long distance, so he can call his friends in Atlanta, Minnesota, <br/>
Tennessee, and Boston any time; and when he&#39;s visiting any of them <br/>
withOUT me, he has easy phone access all the time. He&#39;s usually in <br/>
Atlanta for a week at a time, and I&#39;d rather have a quick line to him <br/>
if either of us needs to get in touch. He&#39;ll be in the Boston area in <br/>
May for a week without me (and flying there too), so again, he&#39;ll have <br/>
a direct line to me. I like that.<br/>
<br/>
Once though---very shortly after getting it, he was staying with <br/>
friends in Atlanta and lost it. We believe it was on the counter and <br/>
was knocked into the trash, maybe, by the cat. So we had insurance and <br/>
got a new one with a $50 fee. Overall, he&#39;s been very careful since.<br/>
<br/>
We still have a landline, but are considering losing that since we all <br/>
have cells now. We&#39;re still considering. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1930482685">1 - DH and I got cellphones several years ago when DH and DS went to a<br/>
local park for a hs group park day. I got an email from the group<br/>
coordinator that it was cancelled due to forecast for rain (it didn&#39;t<br/>
rain until late afternoon as it turned out). DH was already at the park,<br/>
no phone available, waiting for folks to arrive. DS played a bit then<br/>
they left and he called when they got home. We got cell phones shortly<br/>
thereafter so we could communicate - it&#39;s worked really well too - who<br/>
needs OnStar, DH just calls me here at work and I pop open the Internet<br/>
and give him turn by turn instructions to wherever it is they&#39;re going.<br/>
<br/>
2 - We have one of those rollover plans too and we had tons of minutes,<br/>
never a problem...until Dec 2007 when FIL was hospitalized. Over the 3<br/>
1/2 months until his death, we used a BUCKETLOAD of minutes - talking to<br/>
MIL, talking to the hospital admin, coordinating plans with each other<br/>
and with other family members. I nearly hit the floor when I opened the<br/>
bill and saw nearly DOUBLE the usual bill because we had run through our<br/>
regular minutes AND our rollover minutes. Now I&#39;m thinking of going and<br/>
looking at the unlimited plans instead of our minimal plan (which worked<br/>
fine up until now).<br/>
<br/>
3 - one thing with cutting out a landline is that in an emergency (fire,<br/>
medical, etc), cell phones don&#39;t automatically give the dispatcher an<br/>
address but landlines can. Also, some of the Internet phone services can<br/>
be problematic that way too - one guy I work with lives in CT but since<br/>
he&#39;s still got the same Internet phone service, it&#39;s a NJ phone number.<br/>
Not good when you need the fire rescue guys to actually FIND your house.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and here&#39;s your bonus handy safety tip du jour: If you are home<br/>
alone and need to call 911/emergency services and you cannot speak<br/>
(either because of a physical condition or because you&#39;re hiding from an<br/>
intruder or whatever), you can tap out SOS with the phone on a hard<br/>
surface or tap on the mouthpiece with your finger. Dot dot dot (3 quick<br/>
taps) dash dash dash (3 slow taps) dot dot dot (3 quick taps again) -<br/>
Our CPR/AED instructor told us about this...she called several dispatch<br/>
centers, not the emergency lines just their regular number for<br/>
non-emergency calls, and asked the dispatcher if they knew what she was<br/>
doing then tapped it out - they all (like a dozen different places) got<br/>
it right away.<br/>

lost 2 so far. The first was an expensive Razr that we did not have <br/>
insurance on. Since we were under contract I could not buy him another <br/>
phone for less than $200 from anywhere. I sort of tricked the phone <br/>
company by buying a $20 GoPhone and pretending like we already had it <br/>
and not mentioning that it was a GoPhone. The person at the store <br/>
turned it on for free but I was warned that the company might treat it <br/>
as a new line if they found out and charge us the cancelation fee. <br/>
Luckily, they didn&#39;t.<br/>

Hayden on his 9th birthday :) It&#39;s $10/month (for an extra line), the phone<br/>
was free (replacements are pretty cheap & easy to get your hands on, with<br/>
some research on e-bay or craigslist.org).<br/>
It&#39;s especially nice when we&#39;re at Conferences, we can easily stay in<br/>

service. If you cancel your landline for calls, leave a phone plugged in to<br/>
the wall for emergency use (old fashioned is best, the kind that doesn&#39;t<br/>
need electricity to work) -- it&#39;s one of those unexplained charges on the<br/>
phone bills (just says &quot;911 Service&quot; on ours). And new phones have an option<br/>
for gps identification; I can choose &quot;open&quot; or &quot;911 services&quot; for whom the<br/>
information of my location is available.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-300137225">We got rid of our house phone awhile ago and switched to everyone having their<br/>
own cell phone.  My son got his around age 8 when we started homeschooling.<br/>
It only added $5.00 on to the family plan so no big deal.  There&#39;s been a few searches<br/>
for it but it usually turns up between two couch cushions.  <br/>
<br/>
If you have old cell phones, most providers will turn them into a pay as you go plan.<br/>
It will save you the cost of the phone and you will only have to buy the minutes.<br/>
