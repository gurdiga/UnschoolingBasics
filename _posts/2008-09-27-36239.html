<div id="ygrps-yiv-997436491">We pulled the boys from school about 2 yrs ago.  And I homeschooled them.<br/>

began unschooling them.  The deschooling process was not going very well nor<br/>

Does anyone have any experience with RU and younger children? My boys<br/>
are just turning 3 and 5...they are boys with loads of physical<br/>
energy, demands and sibling rivalry. We dropped out of preschool a<br/>
month ago. My 5 year old wants to watch lots of TV (I am really trying<br/>
to trust it), they both don&#39;t want to go to bed, etc. It&#39;s hard to<br/>
watch them gel in front of the screen for so long. I want Ru to be our<br/>
life more than you could all know. I am having a couple of bad days<br/>
now...feeling like a crappy mother for being so tired and cranky from<br/>
lack of sleep...questioning myself constantly...feeling disconnected<br/>
from everyone I know. I have gone to our local unschooling group a few<br/>
times...most of the core parents don&#39;t have more than one child...plus<br/>
the kids are older and into their own thing so they are not very<br/>
interested in us for the most part. <br/>
Dad was out of town for 4 days and they need me to cuddle them all<br/>
night...they are missing him, waking up every 1-2 hours. They have<br/>
never been sound sleepers.We have always slept with our children.My 5<br/>
year old has started to sleep in but the 3 year old wakes up at the<br/>
same time everyday even if he goes to bed late. I don&#39;t know if I am<br/>
doing this right. I know it is hard at first just needing some moral<br/>

 <br/>
This sounds so familiar! :)  We have 3 3/4 year old twin girls, and they are BUSY and also get into each others&#39; space alot, and ask alot of me (in unison &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
 <br/>
~~We dropped out of preschool a month ago. My 5 year old wants to watch lots of TV (I am really trying to trust it), they both don&#39;t want to go to bed, etc. It&#39;s hard to watch them gel in front of the screen for so long. I want Ru to be our life more than you could all know.~~<br/>
 <br/>
We went through this too, where they would sit in front of the tv just mesmerized for almost an entire day, then be runnning around until midnight with all the energy they hadn&#39;t expressed all day.  Fun times! &lt;G&gt;.  The party does settle down eventually.  For us it took a few months for tv and bed to settle into a more sane and relaxed flow.  Now they have no problem walking away from the tv, and no problem heading to bed when they&#39;re tired.<br/>
 <br/>
~~I don&#39;t know if I am doing this right. I know it is hard at first just needing some moral<br/>
support.~~<br/>
 <br/>
I know, it is really quite confusing at first isn&#39;t it?!?  I too was determined to have the RU life I&#39;d read about from Joyce, Sandra, Kelly, Ren, Rue, etc.  I wanted the joy, the connection with my kids, the ease, and for the most part that&#39;s exactly what has happened.  My relationship with dh needs some serious work, but that&#39;s the whole *next* can of worms.<br/>
 <br/>
~~The siblings without rivalry book does not work very well with the younger ones...I am wondering any wisdom for me? I need it big time.~~<br/>
 <br/>
I have experienced that too, that the techniques in the book aren&#39;t geared so much towards 3 year olds.  I too would LOVE to hear about some things that work with the younger crowd.  Our girls bicker, hit, kick, quite a bit, and I&#39;m sure most times I could be responding much more effectively.  Often I find myself stumped at knowing if there is an unmet need, and if so, what the need is.  Any wisdom in this area???<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-701301291">Does anyone have any experience with RU and younger children? My boys<br/>
are just turning 3 and 5...<br/>
<br/>
I have an 11dd, 5 ds and a 1(today)dd.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
they are boys with loads of physical energy, demands and sibling rivalry.<br/>
<br/>
well mine are both girls and boy but they are all equal active and very<br/>
energetic. Um, well they all demand my best and 100% from me.<br/>
<br/>
My 5 year old wants to watch lots of TV (I am really trying<br/>
to trust it),<br/>
<br/>
We have always unschooled but we went through TV because we didn&#39;t get one<br/>
until my oldest was 7 or 8 and ds was about 1 or 2. My dd watched TV<br/>
non-stop for months. It really scared me. She&#39;s watch 12 hours a day 7 days<br/>
a week. I realize looking back at it she really dug in deep because we (me<br/>
and her papa) had issues. I finally let them go and then convinced her papa<br/>
to lay off. We relaxed and she shifted gears. She started walking away from<br/>
TV herself. She started doing other things while watching TV. She started to<br/>
be more creative again (she always had a rich fantasy life). She still<br/>
watches a bit more TV than I would choose but it isn&#39;t her first or prefered<br/>
activity now that she feels safe that it won&#39;t go away or be rationed.<br/>
<br/>
I never went through this with my younger two as we have always had TV<br/>
freedom with unlimited acess and cable.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as you relax and let them be with TV they will relax. As soon as you<br/>
trust that TV is just as good a choose as anything else they will learn to<br/>
trust you. As soon as they know that you won&#39;t take the TV away. And then<br/>
when they have enough they will be free of any hold that TV has over them.<br/>
They are young so it probably wont take long.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
they both don&#39;t want to go to bed, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Why not? Are they tired?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to watch them gel in front of the screen for so long.<br/>
<br/>
Then don&#39;t watch them either watch with them or do something you enjoy. When<br/>
my dd was super into TV I just gave my son all of me. It was almost like he<br/>
was an only for a couple months.<br/>
<br/>
I want Ru to be our<br/>
life more than you could all know.<br/>
<br/>
Let your life be your life. Let it all go. All the expectations, just enjoy<br/>
where you and your kids are.<br/>
<br/>
I am having a couple of bad days<br/>
now...feeling like a crappy mother for being so tired and cranky from<br/>
lack of sleep...questioning myself constantly...feeling disconnected<br/>
from everyone I know.<br/>
<br/>
When I feel this way I try to stay away from other people. just chill at<br/>
home as much as possible. I try to either get more sleep or do low key<br/>
activities like watch TV or movies. I can sometimes read (hard with a<br/>
toddler but somewhat easier with a 3+)<br/>
<br/>
I have gone to our local unschooling group a few<br/>
times...most of the core parents don&#39;t have more than one child...plus<br/>
the kids are older and into their own thing so they are not very<br/>
interested in us for the most part.<br/>
<br/>
Find another group or start one.<br/>
<br/>
Dad was out of town for 4 days and they need me to cuddle them all<br/>
night...they are missing him, waking up every 1-2 hours. They have<br/>
never been sound sleepers.We have always slept with our children.My 5<br/>
year old has started to sleep in but the 3 year old wakes up at the<br/>
same time everyday even if he goes to bed late.<br/>
<br/>
perhaps you can help him fall asleep by setting the stage for sleeping. it<br/>
doesn&#39;t have to be a power struggle, just be there and guide them through<br/>
sleepiness. I don&#39;t know how to advice you as mine have always slept/woke on<br/>
their own for the most part. I just watch for cues and then help them where<br/>
they need it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if I am<br/>
doing this right.<br/>
<br/>
Figuring out how to adjust to new stuff is hard for you and your kids. You<br/>
will all need time to adjust. Go slow, say yes more. Be in the moment, be<br/>
right there with them.<br/>
<br/>
I know it is hard at first just needing some moral<br/>
support. The siblings without rivalry book does not work very well<br/>
with the younger ones...I am wondering any wisdom for me? I need it<br/>
big time.<br/>
<br/>
The hardest thing for me to learn was to be happy exactly where we are. Some<br/>
days are more challenging and are really crazy. That&#39;s life. It is your<br/>
perspective that creates the judgment. I had to learn that just because my<br/>
kids fight or my kid does something &quot;weird&quot; in public it doesn&#39;t mean I am a<br/>
&quot;bad&quot; mama. If my ds eats nothing but candy one day, it is not a reflection<br/>
on me. I can be mindful and loving when my kid is throwing a fit. It takes<br/>
practice but it starts to get easier as you do it more and more.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest key to helping sibs get along is not to take sides. be there to<br/>
help them work it out but don&#39;t tell them the right way, listen to them<br/>
openly.<br/>
<br/>
btw My big hurdle was eating. I am a health &quot;nut&quot;. It was really difficult<br/>
(ok it still is) for me to give up control in this area. My ds5 loves candy<br/>
and sweets. he has pretty much had free access (within our budget) for about<br/>
2 years now. And I still get tense every once in a while when he goes on a<br/>
binge. I know how to not only hold my tongue but relax through it. At 5 he<br/>
is learning to listen to his body, I am so thrilled for him. I never had<br/>
that option as a kid. And just today he fell asleep in the car. dd11 and I<br/>
ran into the farm store to get apples for babydd&#39;s party. We got apples,<br/>
apple cider and cheese. She remembered that they have old fashion candy<br/>
sticks so she wanted to get on for her and her sibs. I thought that was<br/>
thoughtful. When dd11 or ds5 was a baby I would have freaked f someone gave<br/>
them candy...now I am letting my one year have a candy stick. That is<br/>
progress for me. When ds woke up his sister havded him the candy. He smiled<br/>
and thanked her. Then he saw she was eating a pear and wanted that instead.<br/>
So he eat a pear (to the seeds) and then had the candy stick. He wouldn&#39;t<br/>
have been able to choose to eat a pear over candy a couple years ago either.<br/>
He had to feel free to eat which ever he choose before he could really eat<br/>
freely.<br/>

Unschooled:<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;We dropped out of preschool a<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A month seems like a long time with little kids, but its not *so* <br/>
long, really. Especially since it seems like there&#39;s been some <br/>
stress with dad being gone and mom being tired. Expect a certain <br/>
amount of &quot;transitionalness&quot; as all y&#39;all get used to being home <br/>
together.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;My 5 year old wants to watch lots of TV <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A good time for extra snuggling. Do you have lots of toys in the <br/>
same room as the tv? After awhile you&#39;ll likely find they play as <br/>
much as they watch - if not more. My 7yo likes to have tv on in the <br/>
background while she plays, but I swear I don&#39;t know how she has <br/>
time to watch with all the projects she has going on!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;they both don&#39;t want to go to bed<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do you mean you&#39;re trying to get them to bed at a certain time? That <br/>
doesn&#39;t work for a Lot of kids. It takes time for young people to <br/>
figure out the whole &quot;energy management&quot; thing. What does &quot;tired&quot; <br/>
mean, beyond some kind of weird parental agenda? It takes some time <br/>
and experimentation to get a handle on it. <br/>
<br/>
Something to keep in mind if the kids seem &quot;over tired&quot; is to make <br/>
sure they are getting plenty of protein. Some of that grogginess is <br/>
a need for food/drinks. Its good to have snacks readily available <br/>
all the time *and* to offer them periodically, especially with <br/>
active kids, who don&#39;t always notice they are hungry.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;the 3 year old wakes up at the<br/>
&gt; same time everyday even if he goes to bed late<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some people are like that - but its also a good idea to look for <br/>
environmental factors, like the sun coming up! If there&#39;s something <br/>
*waking* him, you may be able to change that. If not, well I&#39;ve been <br/>
there with a cranky &quot;hung over&quot; 3yo, its no fun, for sure, but you <br/>
can take steps to make it better. The most important is to make a <br/>
mental note: Kid is Tired, and plan your day accordingly. Pare down <br/>
any errands or outings to what&#39;s purely necessary. Plan to do more <br/>
snuggling or bathing or tv watching or any other &quot;calming&quot; <br/>
activities. Offer protein regularly. The idea is to ease the stress <br/>
for everyone and be his ally in terms of figuring out this <br/>
whole &quot;sleep&quot; thing. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;My boys<br/>
&gt; are just turning 3 and 5...they are boys with loads of physical<br/>
&gt; energy, demands and sibling rivalry. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The more time and energy you can spend helping them get their <br/>
various needs met, the better. Find ways to work *with* all that <br/>
energy- make sure there are plenty of things for them to climb, hit, <br/>
throw, tackle, jump on (and off and over), swing, swing on... you <br/>
get the idea! Take note of when they seem to need snacks and try to <br/>
offer those *before* they get to the so-hungry-I&#39;m-gonna-hit-someone <br/>
stage. Also notice any kind of natural ups and downs - for instance, <br/>
maybe one of them needs a break around the time the other usually <br/>
gears up? So you&#39;d look for a way to make both those things <br/>
possible - like going for a walk with one in a stroller, or setting <br/>
up one with a bath while you play &quot;balloon soccer&quot; with the other. <br/>
<br/>
Plan to drop any projects or expectations you have for yourself for <br/>
awhile so you can devote extra time and energy to your kids. Pare <br/>
down the housework to a bare minimum (even if you have to lower your <br/>
standards) or find ways to streamline the cleanup. That&#39;s something <br/>
I still do periodically, when I notice my kids are more grumpy and <br/>
out of sorts than usual, and it almost always helps to get us all <br/>
reconnected and restore everyone&#39;s equilibrium. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I am having a couple of bad days<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; lack of sleep...questioning myself constantly...feeling <br/>
 </span></blockquote>disconnected<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; from everyone I know. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, geez and here I go telling you to Spend more time and energy! <br/>
But just like you can look for ways for one kid to get a little down <br/>
time while the other plays, you can look for the same sort of thing <br/>
with yourSelf in mind. Indoor play-places can be a boon for that - <br/>
you can sit on a bench and zone out while the kids whoop it up. <br/>
Bubbles can work well, too - you sit and blow them, the kids run <br/>
around trying to catch them. A length of soft fabric is nice, too - <br/>
something really &quot;silky&quot;. You hold two corners and wave it gently <br/>
while the kids run in and out underneath. I don&#39;t know where you <br/>
live, but in my neck of the woods we have lots of small streams and <br/>
creeks that are fantastic for young kids&#39; play. Lots of mud and <br/>
frogs and rocks and mud and crawdads and slime and mud. Bring a <br/>
change of clothes if you do that ;) <br/>
<br/>
And don&#39;t forget the tv! Don&#39;t use tv-time as a way to get housework <br/>
done, sit with the kids. Use it as a chance to connect with them. <br/>
Even if they&#39;re all wrapped up in the show, they will be happy to <br/>
have you with them and feel closer to you. That&#39;s worth a Lot. Just <br/>
hanging out around the tv with my kids goes a long way to smoothing <br/>
things over when they are getting on each other&#39;s nerves. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>With younger kids and  high energy kids I have found helping them <br/>
with lots of outlets works great. <br/>
<br/>
My kids needed parks, trampolines, and lots of games to burn off all <br/>
of their need to move their bodies.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when they were little the rivalry seemed to be about not <br/>
knowing where to channel the energy.  So fighting seem to release <br/>
some of it, or at least send it towards a target. <br/>
<br/>
Four of our boys were within five years of each other and they were <br/>
guys on the move. We would race and roll and divert. You know your <br/>
boys. You know what matters to who... Like Robby really needed to <br/>
hold the bag when it came to snacks. So it worked best if I asked Rob <br/>
if he wanted to pass out the candy and then he felt powerful. He <br/>
wanted to be in control. The other three just wanted to make sure <br/>
they got some:] So meet the needs and divert possible explosions with <br/>
other activities. <br/>
<br/>
Sandra Dodd talked about helping kids who were having a tough day <br/>
have time in. That worked great for my kids. If someone was seemingly <br/>
fragile I make sure they are getting mom time, comfort (be in the way <br/>
of a backrub or an invite to help me make cookies) something that <br/>
reconnects them to themselves and me too.<br/>
<br/>
It is wonderful this respectful way of doing life with our kids, but <br/>
it is us, me sometimes still who must undo the way I have done <br/>
things. Rethink and find the path that honors each of us. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1907479801">Those of us with older kids had young kids once.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t rule out the possibility that we remember and we have  <br/>
perspective and can look back with the benefit of hindsight being  <br/>
20/20, of course &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re in the very very beginning stages of unschooling - life is a  <br/>
little wild and crazy with kids the ages of yours - so expect that and  <br/>
go with it, don&#39;t resist it. Support their interests - that is your  <br/>
unschooling mantra. Their interests are being physical and wild, right?<br/>
<br/>
Do things together out of the house really often in places that  <br/>
encourage really active hard play. They need the burn-off time. Maybe  <br/>
stop now and make a list of ALL the places you can think of that are  <br/>
within, say, an hour of home. Every different park, beach, playground,  <br/>
ice-skating and roller-skating rinks, bowling, play places at fast  <br/>
food restaurants. Water play is the BEST - a pool is ideal, playing in  <br/>
sprinklers, with a hose, with lots of containers, a slip-n-slide, or  <br/>
even in the bathtub, is great. Put down a bunch of towels all over the  <br/>
floor and let them splash and have fun. Let them do that alone, not  <br/>
always with their brother, too, because water play is very centering  <br/>
and brings a deep sense of peace. With little boys that age, I&#39;d be  <br/>
going out every single day. Also, be sure you have plenty of play  <br/>
equipment at home - a trampoline in the back yard, a swing set and  <br/>
other climbing equipment?<br/>
<br/>
Initiate fun activity that use a lot of energy. I used to set up  <br/>
&quot;obstacle courses&quot; in the house when the weather was bad. After I&#39;d  <br/>
set one up, we&#39;d time them on it, over and over. Then they&#39;d get  <br/>
started making their own obstacle courses and would spend a long time  <br/>
doing them. When I was out at thrift stores or Big Lots or 99 cent  <br/>
stores, I&#39;d find things that could be used as part of an obstacle  <br/>
course. Be really creative.<br/>
<br/>
IF they&#39;re interested, they might like a martial arts activity that is  <br/>
geared toward young children. Martial arts programs can sometimes be  <br/>
really really fun for little kids with a lot of focus on games. Shop  <br/>
around and choose carefully, though.<br/>
<br/>
Sibling rivalry will be lessened the more you find many ways to  <br/>
support their interests and provide an abundance of what they need. It  <br/>
won&#39;t disappear entirely, probably, because these are kids who are  <br/>
just learning to be social and they&#39;re living in very close proximity  <br/>
to others who are also just learning. Conflict is pretty much  <br/>
inevitable, to some degree. Expect it and don&#39;t get all emotional over  <br/>
it, yourself. Try distracting them toward something cool/positive/ <br/>
desired as often as possible - in a way that meets the child&#39;s needs  <br/>
to the maximum extent you can manage. Sometimes &quot;give it to them in  <br/>
fantasy&quot; is an amazing tension-reducer in sibling rivalry situations.  <br/>
For example, if the kids are fighting over which tv show to watch or  <br/>
over using the video game console or over who gets to sit where in the  <br/>
car or .... give it to them in fantasy in a big way. Say, &quot;Gosh, you  <br/>
know what I really wish? I wish someone would invent a tv that showed  <br/>
each person just what THAT person wanted to see - all at the same  <br/>
time.&quot; IF you become skilled at staying cool, calm and collected in  <br/>
the face of conflict, you can sense whether or not these kinds of  <br/>
things will help or add fuel to the fire. Depends. Also, be sure to  <br/>
give them plenty of time apart from each other. Maybe they need a lot  <br/>
more of that than is convenient for you, but making the effort to find  <br/>
ways to do it will pay off.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing will just &quot;fix&quot; the sibling rivalry or the exhaustion that  <br/>
comes of having 3 and 5 yo little boys around all the time. Change  <br/>
your expectations and remember it is all a process. Try to experience  <br/>
the feeling of life flowing like a river, rather than expecting it to  <br/>
be static like a lake.<br/>

&gt; Does anyone have any experience with RU and younger children? My boys<br/>
&gt; are just turning 3 and 5...they are boys with loads of physical<br/>
&gt; energy, demands and sibling rivalry. We dropped out of preschool a<br/>
&gt; month ago. My 5 year old wants to watch lots of TV (I am really trying<br/>
&gt; to trust it), they both don&#39;t want to go to bed, etc. It&#39;s hard to<br/>
&gt; watch them gel in front of the screen for so long. I want Ru to be our<br/>
&gt; life more than you could all know. I am having a couple of bad days<br/>
&gt; now...feeling like a crappy mother for being so tired and cranky from<br/>
&gt; lack of sleep...questioning myself constantly...feeling disconnected<br/>
&gt; from everyone I know. I have gone to our local unschooling group a few<br/>
&gt; times...most of the core parents don&#39;t have more than one child...plus<br/>
&gt; the kids are older and into their own thing so they are not very<br/>
&gt; interested in us for the most part. <br/>
&gt; Dad was out of town for 4 days and they need me to cuddle them all<br/>
&gt; night...they are missing him, waking up every 1-2 hours. They have<br/>
&gt; never been sound sleepers.We have always slept with our children.My 5<br/>
&gt; year old has started to sleep in but the 3 year old wakes up at the<br/>
&gt; same time everyday even if he goes to bed late. I don&#39;t know if I am<br/>
&gt; doing this right. I know it is hard at first just needing some moral<br/>
&gt; support. The siblings without rivalry book does not work very well<br/>
&gt; with the younger ones...I am wondering any wisdom for me? I need it<br/>

&gt; &gt; back to school they went for about 3 weeks and I pulled them out<br/>

&gt; &gt; began unschooling them.  The deschooling process was not going very<br/>

&gt; &gt; very fast.  I was having to defend my decision to my husband as<br/>

&gt; &gt; Sleep was the first thing to &quot;fix&quot; itself in the boys.  I already<br/>

&gt; &gt; in the sleep survey someone posted but when I let go of trying to<br/>
&gt; control<br/>
&gt; &gt; sleep the boys went wild with it.  Staying up all night, sleeping<br/>
&gt; all day.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  But here we are about a year into this and now they go to bed at<br/>
10 pm<br/>
&gt; &gt; every night (their idea) and they are up about 7-8am each day.  Also<br/>
&gt; their<br/>
&gt; &gt; idea.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; There hasn&#39;t been much &quot;learning&quot; in the conventional sense.  Lots<br/>

&gt; oldest who<br/>
&gt; &gt; hates to read asked me to buy him a book and he&#39;s been reading for<br/>
&gt; pleasure.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Just let go and trust your kids.  It works.  The BIGGEST problem<br/>

&gt; &gt; same time everyday even if he goes to bed late. I don&#39;t know if I am<br/>
&gt; &gt; doing this right. I know it is hard at first just needing some moral<br/>
&gt; &gt; support. The siblings without rivalry book does not work very well<br/>
&gt; &gt; with the younger ones...I am wondering any wisdom for me? I need it<br/>
&gt; &gt; big time.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; We pulled the boys from school about 2 yrs ago. And I homeschooled<br/>
&gt; &gt; them.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; It was damaging our relationship to be their teacher as well as<br/>
&gt; &gt; parent. So<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; back to school they went for about 3 weeks and I pulled them out<br/>
&gt; &gt; again. And<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; began unschooling them. The deschooling process was not going very<br/>
&gt; &gt; well nor<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; very fast. I was having to defend my decision to my husband as<br/>
&gt; well as<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; fight my own demons.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Sleep was the first thing to &quot;fix&quot; itself in the boys. I already<br/>
&gt; &gt; wrote this<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in the sleep survey someone posted but when I let go of trying to<br/>
&gt; &gt; control<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; sleep the boys went wild with it. Staying up all night, sleeping<br/>
&gt; &gt; all day.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; But here we are about a year into this and now they go to bed at<br/>
&gt; 10 pm<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; every night (their idea) and they are up about 7-8am each day. Also<br/>
&gt; &gt; their<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; idea.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; There hasn&#39;t been much &quot;learning&quot; in the conventional sense. Lots<br/>
&gt; &gt; of screen<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; time. Not much outside time. But just in the last two weeks, my<br/>
&gt; &gt; oldest who<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; hates to read asked me to buy him a book and he&#39;s been reading for<br/>
&gt; &gt; pleasure.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Just let go and trust your kids. It works. The BIGGEST problem<br/>
&gt; &gt; with this<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; whole RU/deschooling process has been my husband and my resistance<br/>
&gt; &gt; to it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; All the &quot;yeah buts&quot;... And here I raised some hell while I had<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; pre-learning tantrums. Giving up what you always thought you knew<br/>
&gt; &gt; is scary<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and threatening and boy did I have fits here. I&#39;m SO glad I finally<br/>
&gt; &gt; got the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; message to just shut up and read.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; With deep gratitude to Ren, Joyce, Kelly, et al.<br/>
