Twelve? 18? 25?  Hoe would you go about doing that?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1677353569">Hallo,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Laila and most of the time I just read along. But with the question if<br/>
you &#39;ve ever seen an 7y old watch graphic sex or violence I wanted to tell<br/>
you about our family.<br/>
<br/>
I have an 8y old son who loves to watch mangacartoons. They are filled with<br/>
sex and violence, bud he finds real porno disgusting even when my dh and I<br/>
are kissing he&#39;s almost throwing up:-)(even just talking or thinking about<br/>
it makes him shiver). And what about violent movies? He&#39;s afraid to watch<br/>
them. So I asked him what it is then what he likes about manga&#39;s. The<br/>
answer: the graphics, he likes the way it&#39;s drawn.<br/>
<br/>
The rest of the family doesn&#39;t like manga&#39;s so he watches them in his room.<br/>
<br/>
My 4y old daughter loves to watch 24, but she is afraid of Barbie movies,<br/>
fairy tales,shrek,chicken little and lots of other cartoons.<br/>
<br/>
So with that in mind how can you tell them what is ok for them to watch and<br/>
what not.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Which implies that you don&#39;t let him. So there are restrictions.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra Dodd has a page on what parents say their kids will do:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/ifilet">http://sandradodd.com/ifilet</a><br/>
<br/>
What is limited and scarce becomes precious.<br/>
<br/>
It used to be I wouldn&#39;t let myself have chocolate in the house  <br/>
because I knew I&#39;d eat the whole bag. At Halloween I had to buy candy  <br/>
the day of or I&#39;d eat them one after another. In fact one year I went  <br/>
through 3 bags of candy the week before Halloween. I knew I couldn&#39;t  <br/>
be trusted with candy. I&#39;d proved it.<br/>
<br/>
But what I actually knew was how I behaved under restrictions.  <br/>
Someone somewhere talked about giving yourself permission to have  <br/>
whatever you crave. Give yourself permission to go buy more when it&#39;s  <br/>
running low. Don&#39;t create a scarcity. It made no sense! I *knew* I&#39;d  <br/>
just eat and eat and eat and grow to 300 lbs.<br/>
<br/>
But I tried it. It took me 3 bags of almond M&Ms and several days of  <br/>
feeling yucky but I did eventually get my fill. Now I can eat just a  <br/>
few at a time.  It used to be I&#39;d eat an entire row of Oreos only  <br/>
stopping because I felt yucky and then swore I&#39;d never have another  <br/>
Oreo -- which lasted until I stopped feeling yucky and would have  <br/>
several more. But because I gave myself permission to have as much as  <br/>
I wanted, we now have a never empty bowl of Dove milk chocolates  <br/>
(which I think are heavenly). I have maybe 3 a week. I can keep a bag  <br/>
of Oreos in the house *and they get stale.*<br/>
<br/>
And funny thing is that my weight is still what it was when I was  <br/>
restricting certain foods from my diet.<br/>
<br/>
Deprivation makes for desperation.<br/>
<br/>
In your child&#39;s case it could also be novelty. Anything new is bound  <br/>
to be eaten in greater quantities.<br/>
<br/>
It could also be convenience. One of the great attractions of so- <br/>
called junk foods is that they&#39;re easy to grab and eat. Lots of  <br/>
people on the list have great ideas for easy, healthful snacks that  <br/>
are just as easy to grab. It&#39;s helpful to keep the &quot;junk&quot;/convenience  <br/>
food up above eye level so it&#39;s eaten when a child specifically wants  <br/>
that rather than because it&#39;s easy to grab. It&#39;s helpful not to buy  <br/>
convenience foods that aren&#39;t specifically requested.<br/>
<br/>
It could be he&#39;s gearing up for a growth spurt and instinctively  <br/>
knows he needs high calorie foods.<br/>
<br/>
No one &quot;just&quot; does anything. There are reasons behind what kids do.  <br/>
And we can help them get what they want. But just because they keep  <br/>
reaching for the chips on the low shelf doesn&#39;t mean that&#39;s what they  <br/>
want -- unless they&#39;re saying &quot;Mom, put chips on the list!&quot; They  <br/>
might just be grabbing something that gets them back to playing as  <br/>
soon as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike conventional parenting advice, mindful parenting advice always  <br/>
begins with &quot;It depends ...&quot; ;-) because it depends on what the child  <br/>
really wants and why.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a huge collection of answers to typical unschooling and  <br/>
parenting questions at:<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t read the other replies to this yet, but I can say that if <br/>
my 5.5yo wanted to stay up and watch Adult Swim with my 13yo, I <br/>
would start by asking why? I would also explain that those <br/>
were &quot;grown up&quot; shows that she might not like and might find scary <br/>
and offer to ask Ray to tape them for us to watch later. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had conversations like this before. She knows that I&#39;m looking <br/>
out for her needs and interests, knows that *I* know what sorts of <br/>
things she finds frightening or just plain dull so she&#39;s happy to <br/>
let me run a little interference for her - interference that can <br/>
include me watching with her so she feels empowered to ff or turn it <br/>
off, or me previewing the tape so I can give her better information. <br/>
<br/>
In any case, its not so much a matter of &quot;setting limits&quot; as of <br/>
giving my kid the best information I can so she can make an informed <br/>
decision *and* facilitating that decision in such a way that she <br/>
feels supported regardless of whether she wants to watch the whole <br/>
thing, or some or none of it. <br/>

with really graphic violence, though, if the background music <br/>

Yeah, I don&#39;t like suspense much either. Fatal Attraction---my heart&#39;s <br/>
just racing too fast.<br/>
<br/>
But *oddly*, I love M Night Shamalan&#39;s movies---FULL of suspense, but <br/>
not really scary---I don&#39;t know the attraction. Clever? Twisty? I just <br/>
think he&#39;s brilliant. But I have to work myself up to watching his <br/>
stuff. &lt;g&gt; Afterwards, I&#39;m glad I did, but *getting* there is hard.<br/>
<br/>
Cameron was truly scared after the alien one (with Mel Gibson?)---with <br/>
the alien that appears in the TV&#39;s reflection. He was afraid of TVs <br/>
that were turned off, so for a while, the TVs had to be turned on or <br/>
covered. So we did. I had towels by each TV so that he wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
scared. He can have turned off TVs around now. No problem. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I *could* have told him that he chose to watch the movie, so he should <br/>
just deal with the consequences. He may have still wanted to watch <br/>
scary movies, but not told me because he would know I wouldn&#39;t help. Or <br/>
sworn them off altogether. Or not known there were other options for <br/>
dealing with his fears. I&#39;m always here to help! Towel in hand! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When we work *with* our kids instead of fighting them, it&#39;s all good.<br/>

Do the &quot;no limits&quot; on anything apply to kids of all ages?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yep---no arbitrary limits for anyone---regardless of age.<br/>
<br/>
-=-==-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t put limits for instance on food. We try to eat healthy and set <br/>
a good<br/>
example, but if there is junk in the house my 3 yo will eat that and<br/>
nothing else if i let him.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
First of all, you &quot;If I let&quot; statement has been enshrined on Sandra&#39;s <br/>
&quot;If I let&quot; page ( www.sandradodd.com/unschooling/ifilet ). Go check out <br/>
some other wild statements that other parents wrote that their children <br/>
would do &quot;if I let&quot; them.<br/>
<br/>
Next: If I put no limits on food, but ate healthily and set a good <br/>
example, how does that differ from TV-watching if my husband and I <br/>
watch only what we consider good on TV and set a good example?<br/>
<br/>
Keeping the tv from a young child until mom feels it&#39;s &quot;safe&quot; to allow <br/>
the child access will backfire. Because whenever that time comes (six? <br/>
seven? ten? twelve? eighteen? when??), the child will probably be GLUED <br/>
to the tv for months. Mom will say: &quot;See? I KNEW that would happen! <br/>
It&#39;s addictive!&quot; and remove the TV again.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, if from the time the child is an infant, if TV is just another <br/>
*thing* in the house, it becomes...well...just another <br/>
*thing*---nothing special. Just a box. Nothing almighty powerful.<br/>
<br/>
Like Sleeping Beauty&#39;s spindle. Keeping her from it MADE her prick her <br/>
finger. Had she always been around spindles, her parents could have <br/>
said, &quot;Don&#39;t pick up a spindle on your 16th birthday---you&#39;ve been <br/>
cursed.&quot; Instead, they burned all the spindles and made it an <br/>
attractive novelty for the inevitable prick on her birthday.<br/>
<br/>
Arbitrary limits will not accomplish what you think they will. Usually <br/>
*just* the opposite!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-472760301">I am new to unschooling and struggle with the limits thing- BUT_ from this discussion it finally hit me that the issue is not limits or no limits but arbitrary limits. Having limits just because is not freedom. Having so called limits based on age, adult vs child is wrong but limits based on want/need/choice is what it is all about. I think all of us just want to be able to choose for ourselves. Thanks all <br/>
