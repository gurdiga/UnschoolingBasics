<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
I was hoping to get input from some more established unschoolers, some<br/>
of the  *radical*  gals about this situation. it&#39;s been ongoing for<br/>
some time, and I&#39;m starting to  wonder <br/>
where the breakdown is....<br/>
<br/>
We have a local unschooling group that the kids have really enjoyed.<br/>
We&#39;ve done  some  wonderful trips and gatherings, and am looking<br/>
forward to some more. Having said  that, <br/>
there have been a few incidents that leave me scratching my head. One<br/>
was at a beach playdate, where an older child was verbally abusing<br/>
some of the toddlers, calling them names, pushing them around, really<br/>
without provocation. When it was brought up kindly that there was a<br/>
problem, the mom left huffily.<br/>
<br/>
A second was at a museum, where a preschool aged child was<br/>
hitting/slapping/ the youngers (one year, two years <br/>
old) in an attempt to get the toys he wanted. In all situations, i was<br/>
present and did what I would do with my older children, some modeling,<br/>
empathy, redirection. &quot;Wow, you really want that toy! Would you like<br/>
to play with this one, she&#39;s already playing with that one!&quot; <br/>
or &quot;Why don&#39;t you ask for a trade, you can offer her this one, and<br/>
maybe she&#39;ll share.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
She very nearly always got what she wanted out of the deal. Finally<br/>
after the second gut punch to a baby, I said &quot;It is NOT okay to hit.<br/>
You may use words to ask for what you want.&quot; When I <br/>
moved the baby to protect it, *I* was the next one hit. The mom was<br/>
standing right there and told her that what she was doing was okay,<br/>
and I got an evil look from BOTH of them. <br/>
<br/>
Where in unschooling does it say that this is okay? Have I missed<br/>
something? It seems to me as I was reading John Holt that he said it<br/>
was just as off to be a &#39;child-worshiper&#39;, believing they could do no<br/>
wrong, as it was to be a &#39;child-manager&#39;, believing they could do no<br/>
right without us.<br/>
<br/>
 Are we responsible for modeling behavior that is fair to everyone in<br/>
a situation? Is it unfair to expect safety for all children, not just<br/>
those who can express their needs by hurting others verbally or<br/>
physically? My daughter is starting to really dislike these kids, and<br/>
is starting to dislike our trips. Surely we aren&#39;t the only family on <br/>
here facing this issue. Thanks all.</div>

<br/>
I think people get blinkered by the idea of letting children choose  <br/>
what they want and that eventually, somehow, they&#39;ll pick up social  <br/>
niceties in due course.<br/>
<br/>
But kids *also* want to get along with others. Even if they can&#39;t  <br/>
articulate it, they don&#39;t want other people to dislike them! We owe  <br/>
it to them -- and owe it to other people! -- to help them not hurt  <br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;It is NOT okay to hit.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s quite possible she can&#39;t control herself yet. She may know it&#39;s  <br/>
not okay -- though from her mother&#39;s reaction maybe not! -- but she  <br/>
1) can&#39;t control the urge to hit or 2) doesn&#39;t have the skills yet to  <br/>
try another way.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s helpful to do as you did: point out the principle and  <br/>
move onto something that will help them get what they want. &quot;That&#39;s  <br/>
not okay. Try this instead.&quot; But knowing what they can&#39;t do isn&#39;t  <br/>
enough to stop them from doing it ;-) It takes time. It takes adults  <br/>
willing to say &quot;No, not acceptable.&quot; It takes adults patient enough  <br/>
and willing to help them with other techniques that *are* acceptable.<br/>
<br/>
As for the huffy moms, I have no clue what to suggest!<br/>

<br/>
Same here.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really baffled as to why a mother would stand by while her child<br/>
was having difficulties in any social situation...especially at such a<br/>
young age. They NEED mindful adults to help them navigate those kind<br/>
of interactions!<br/>
<br/>
If my child was even ACTING like they were going to harm a baby in any<br/>
way, I&#39;d be right there next to them. Allowing your child to hurt<br/>
other people has absolutely nothing to do with unschooling. It sounds<br/>
like parents that have somehow turned &quot;interest led&quot; into &quot;do whatever<br/>
you want&quot;. Yuck.<br/>
<br/>
If a young child is showing any signs of having trouble interacting<br/>
with other children, it&#39;s really great if a parent can get very close,<br/>
listen and remove the child if they are going to hit or hurt other<br/>
people. I&#39;m really sorry you&#39;re having such difficulties with other<br/>
unschoolers. It&#39;s very sad to me that anyone would get in a huff when<br/>
a baby was  being protected from harm.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t have any problem telling the mother &quot;your child is hurting<br/>
the baby, could you please help me with this?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like a lack of parenting to me.<br/>

No where, I would hope. You are right and she is wrong and now what are you going to do about it? Meet with other group members and plan an intervention? <br/>

&gt; some time, and I&#39;m starting to  wonder <br/>
&gt; where the breakdown is....<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling frequently gets equated with the idea of &quot;independent <br/>
learning&quot; and I think that&#39;s where people get confused. Independence <br/>
is a big-time cultural value, and for young kids, <br/>
especially, &quot;promoting independence&quot; is considered pretty important. <br/>
Some unschoolers get kind of stuck on the whole independence thing, <br/>
thinking it means we shouldn&#39;t help our kids figure out the world. <br/>
Learning in freedom becomes equated with hands off parenting. <br/>
<br/>
That being said, being an unschooler, and even understanding that <br/>
kids need help figuring out the world, doesn&#39;t automatically make <br/>
someone the world&#39;s most skillful parent. And being a reasonably <br/>
skillful parent of one&#39;s own kids doesn&#39;t necessarily mean one <br/>
handles group social situations involving kid-disputes very <br/>
successfully. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; at a beach playdate, where an older child was verbally abusing<br/>
&gt; some of the toddlers, calling them names, pushing them around, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>really<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; without provocation. When it was brought up kindly that there was a<br/>
&gt; problem, the mom left huffily.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This struck a chord with me - was the mom confronted *after* this <br/>
happened or did someone call mom&#39;s attention to the problem while it <br/>
was happening? Mo&#39;s 5.5 and usually plays really well at public <br/>
playgrounds, so I often hang out with the other moms and chat on <br/>
homeschool group days. The vast majority of the time, that&#39;s fine, <br/>
and I&#39;ll either notice or someone will tell me if there&#39;s a problem <br/>
that I need to address. Sometimes its &quot;hey our kids are throwing <br/>
sand at each other, you wanna go, or shall I?&quot; and sometimes its &quot;is <br/>
that Morgan?&quot; and off I go. <br/>
<br/>
There was one time when a mom told me, after the fact, that Mo had <br/>
hit her dd. I appologised to the mom and the girl and made sure the <br/>
girl was okay, but mom and kid glared at me as though there <br/>
was &quot;more&quot; that they expected. I drifted away, feeling as though I <br/>
was expected to go beat or yell at my kid, even though I knew the <br/>
family to be unschoolers. When I asked Morgan about the incident <br/>
later, she didn&#39;t know what I was talking about. I keep a closer eye <br/>
on Mo when that family comes to playgroups, though. The kids are <br/>
dainty, and Mo&#39;s really robust, so its a good idea anyway.<br/>
<br/>

most socially-ept of ages. Where were the babies moms? Were you left <br/>
in charge of the little ones so moms could take older siblings to <br/>
another area? Again, this sounds like a case of not enough parental <br/>
involvement - not *just* a matter of one kid being too rough. <br/>
<br/>

&gt; and I got an evil look from BOTH of them. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>On the one hand, protecting the babies was a priority, but OTOH, <br/>
we&#39;ve had some pretty involved discussions on this board about <br/>
saying things like &quot;its not okay to hit&quot; - there are some <br/>
differences of opinion amongst unschoolers. It might be better to <br/>
avoid the implied judgement and say &quot;OW! That hurts!&quot; to a child who <br/>
is hitting. Some unschoolers are also offended by comments such <br/>
as &quot;use words&quot; especially to younger children and/or children who <br/>
aren&#39;t naturally verbal. <br/>
<br/>
If you are interested in hanging out with this family again, it <br/>
would be a good idea to chat with mom and find out how *she* would <br/>
handle this sort of situation. What are *her* expectations and <br/>
concerns? It may be that she felt her child was being belittled <br/>
or &quot;forced to share&quot; and your specific language reinforced that <br/>
somehow.<br/>
<br/>
Getting back to the whole &quot;independence = hands off parenting&quot; <br/>
thing, I have met two unschoolers irl who are very defensive of <br/>
their childrens&#39; &quot;right&quot; to hit other people. One I&#39;ve only <br/>
encountered in adult situations, but the other staunchly defended <br/>
her son&#39;s right to insult and hit other kids as a matter of &quot;free <br/>
expression&quot;. Neither of these moms has a social network of other <br/>
unschooling families, though, which I think could be a big factor. <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, those two families were my first experiences <br/>
with &quot;unschooling&quot;. Yikes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-127434560">Interesting.... I was talking with a unschooling/homeschooling mom friend of<br/>
mine about these situations.<br/>
My instant reaction to this and really has been something I think of often<br/>
is that in adult life (which is what we are trying to create here right?<br/>
Good, happy healthy adults???) is that that is simply unacceptable and we<br/>
all know it as also illegal!<br/>
Isnt called battery? Abuse?<br/>
Now I know that is harsh and drastic but I just think that in adult life my<br/>
two girls will not be able to hit another person and it is my job now as mom<br/>
to make sure that that doesn&#39;t happen. I expect other parents to do the same<br/>
because my daughters have to live with your kids... Have to play with your<br/>
kids etc etc....<br/>
I have read the RIE teachings of Magda Gerber (I have one of her books and<br/>
havent read it front to back is what I am saying) and she simply states that<br/>
you don&#39;t intervene until physical harm is an issue or looks to be like it<br/>
will be one. I agree.<br/>
This isnt a free for all in this world and as parents we have to be the<br/>
first ones to make sure out kids understand what is correct in life. Hitting<br/>
is not correct- you will get in trouble. I believe it is out duty.<br/>
Now I don&#39;t intervene in squabbles, you took my toy away and sharing etc-<br/>
Unless it escalates to where you know your child will hit. I have an almost<br/>
two year old who at this time in her life does get that frustrated, she has<br/>
not hit a person but will throw the toy... My 4 yo is very passive and would<br/>
give the toy away and walk away before anything was an issue.<br/>
You stated the word &quot;safety&quot;. And simply put- allowing your child to hit<br/>
another is unsafe...<br/>
Keep us updated!! :)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1119693848">I realize that this post is in response to situations where a mother<br/>
was actually defending her child&#39;s &quot;right&quot; to hit, but it brings up a<br/>
semantic question that always bothers me.<br/>
<br/>
Generally in our culture when people say some behavior is<br/>
&quot;unacceptable&quot; or &quot;not allowed&quot; or &quot;not tolerated&quot;, they mean that a<br/>
significant punishment (jail for adults, time-out, sent to room,<br/>
removal from group activity in an explicitly punitive way, grounding,<br/>
or spanking for children) will follow if/when it occurs -- which<br/>
suggests to me that it actually *is* allowed to happen, just punished<br/>
afterward.  I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what&#39;s meant here?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know this is in reference to an older/larger child hitting a <br/>
younger/smaller child to get a toy, but I have to admit, I&#39;m one of <br/>
those folks I metioned who isn&#39;t comfortable with blanket statements <br/>
like the above. Its entirely situational.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday we had one of our big skatepark days - its over an hour&#39;s <br/>
drive, so we tend to make a day of it. There&#39;s a great playground <br/>
right next to the skatepark, so Morgan and I hang out there while <br/>
Ray skates. As luck would have it, Ray fell about an hour after we <br/>
got there, and decided he was too battered to keep skating - nothing <br/>
serious, he just didn&#39;t want to fall any more that day. Mo wasn&#39;t <br/>
anywhere near done playing, though, so he hung out and another <br/>
unschooling mom from our regular playgroup showed up about the same <br/>
time with a dd about Mo&#39;s age. Just setting the scene, here.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this other girl is right about Mo&#39;s speed in terms of <br/>
phyiscallity - think Mac truck in a skirt and pigtails. Now imagine <br/>
two of them. They invented a game that involved chasing Ray all over <br/>
the playground, tackling him, hitting him, throwing things at him - <br/>
he thought it was lots of fun. And less painful than falling of his <br/>
skateboard, although he did put his pads back on. This kind of <br/>
consensual rough play is normal for Rayan, as much as it is for <br/>
Morgan. *He* is big enough now that he&#39;ll rough-house with adults - <br/>
real grown men wrestling, and although they&#39;re still going easy on <br/>
him, this is relative. <br/>
<br/>
So to say hitting is unsafe or unacceptable doesn&#39;t fly with my <br/>
kids. We have to talk about different bodies and personalities and <br/>
consent and ways to say no and hear no from others. They&#39;re both <br/>
great about understanding that younger kids need to be handled a bit <br/>
more gently, but Mo&#39;s still sometimes baffled when she encounters a <br/>
kid her age or older who doesn&#39;t like to play rough, so I try to <br/>
keep an eye out for new situations. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have an almost<br/>

 </span></blockquote>and would<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; give the toy away and walk away before anything was an issue.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You know a lot of that is temperament, though, right? Some kids are <br/>
naturally more easy going, more accomodating, more, as you say, <br/>
passive. Its not a result of better parenting. Some kids absolutely <br/>
do need more help knowing *when* its not okay to hit someone or help <br/>
with impulse control. I have certainly met parents who don&#39;t help <br/>
their kids figure these things out and &quot;blame the victim&quot; for not <br/>
fighting back, and I&#39;m not advocating that in the least.<br/>
<br/>
What I am trying to say is that to really physical kids, saying &quot;its <br/>
not okay to hit&quot; is pure bs. It *is* okay to hit sometimes, for <br/>
protection or for fun. Saying something like &quot;I/he didn&#39;t like <br/>
that&quot;, &quot;That hurt&quot;, &quot;I don&#39;t like to be hit&quot; all convey more <br/>
information - information physical kids really need to understand <br/>
the world.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure that I agree with this, but I think the key word may <br/>
be &quot;intervene&quot;. I haven&#39;t read the book you mentioned, but I suspect <br/>
that by &quot;intervene&quot; the author is thinking in terms of an adult <br/>
stepping in and resolving the situation *for* the kids in some <br/>
authoritiarian manner - enforced sharing or whatever. <br/>
<br/>
Its possible to help kids resolve differences without it being a <br/>
matter of intervention in that sense. I can&#39;t think how many times <br/>
I&#39;ve said &quot;I thing X is saying...&quot; and had the other child respond <br/>
positively. Its not always that simple, but often they just need <br/>
help communicating - heck, I&#39;ve done it with adults, too. I&#39;m not <br/>
always *right* (not being Kelly!) but sometimes having a different <br/>
perspective on the table can shift the focus from antagonism to <br/>
problem-solving.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Now I don&#39;t intervene in squabbles, you took my toy away and <br/>
&gt;sharing etc-<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That word again.... I *do* help my kids try to problem solve these <br/>
kinds of situations *if* they are open to my assistance. Morgan <br/>
doesn&#39;t always want my help if she&#39;s playing with her longtime pal, <br/>
Savannah, for example, and Sv&#39;s mom and I have worked out a way for <br/>
all of us to communicate and know when parental assistance is <br/>
needed. Newer friends, Mo is more likely to welcome a bit of input <br/>
from mom. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe its bc I have a child who *does* hit when she&#39;s frustrated. <br/>
Not only do I want her to resolve her difficulties before she gets <br/>
to the punch-throwing stage, I can see that its better all &#39;round if <br/>
the issue is resolved *well* before then, so everyone stays happy <br/>
and wants to keep playing and being friends. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1026149765">~~- which<br/>

<br/>
I took &quot;unnacceptable&quot; to mean that it isn&#39;t acceptable for the mother<br/>
to stand by while her child harmed another child. Hitting or harming<br/>
another human being isn&#39;t ok in our house either. Yet we don&#39;t punish.<br/>
 <br/>
I do judge physical harm as an &quot;unacceptable&quot; method of problem<br/>
solving, but that doesn&#39;t mean it won&#39;t occasionally  happen with my<br/>
youngest. I assume he&#39;s doing his best at the moment and simply needs<br/>
help resolving the issue so both parties can be at peace. We don&#39;t<br/>
punish him, we try really hard not to shame him (though it can<br/>
sometimes seep through if one is frustrated in the moment).<br/>
<br/>
I try to be proactive and present so when there is a difficult moment,<br/>
my kids don&#39;t feel the need to resort to hitting someone. Our line of<br/>
defense has been &quot;use your words, if that doesn&#39;t work then get an<br/>
arbitrator to help resolve the issue, if that doesn&#39;t work then<br/>
hitting might be an option&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
We know with an arbitrator available, it won&#39;t need to get to the<br/>
hitting stage :) and if there was that much intensity, I get the<br/>
parties separated until we can discuss it calmly.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody deserves to be hit and harmed. I believe our home should be a<br/>
safe haven for all. Parents need to make sure their home is safe for<br/>
their children.<br/>

Now I don&#39;t intervene in squabbles, you took my toy away and sharing <br/>
etc-<br/>
Unless it escalates to where you know your child will hit. I have an <br/>
almost<br/>
two year old who at this time in her life does get that frustrated, she <br/>
has<br/>
not hit a person but will throw the toy... My 4 yo is very passive and <br/>
would<br/>
give the toy away and walk away before anything was an issue.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
My problem with the above advice is that children have very few tools <br/>
to start with. Letting things go until they escalate is simply too late.<br/>
<br/>
If you are there to help from the beginning, the children will gain <br/>
tools *through your help and advice* to avoid hitting at all. Letting <br/>
it get to a place just before hitting shortens their arsenal of tools <br/>
to work it out *before* the frustration even commences. Why is <br/>
toy-throwing acceptable? It doesn&#39;t even have to get *that* far!<br/>
<br/>
Why would you not intervene in &quot;squabbles?&quot; Seems to me as if that&#39;s <br/>
the FIRST place to intervene.<br/>
