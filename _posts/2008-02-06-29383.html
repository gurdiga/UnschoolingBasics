<div id="ygrps-yiv-866360860">Has anyone heard of the Stratford Career Institute?  It is an online<br/>
college level school based in Canada.  I&#39;ve researched this school. <br/>
It seems to have a good reputation and is accredited.  However, I<br/>
can&#39;t find anyone who has tried it and I don&#39;t know much about how an<br/>
online school works except that this one is inexpensive and you work<br/>
at your own pace.  Such a school would be perfect for me and my wife<br/>
because of work and home schooling duties.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who has some information, or wants to know more about this<br/>
school, please email me at backtocebu at yahoo.<br/>
