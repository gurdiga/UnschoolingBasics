<div id="ygrps-yiv-84672767">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I found this site a great, however I am irreverent about religion and<br/>
the bible. I was reffered to the site by a Unitatrian Universalist<br/>
intern minister with a great sense of humor. I have read a couple of<br/>
the stories, and had a good laugh. <br/>

&gt; Scripture at www.thebricktestament.com.  Truly, God works in<br/>
 </span></blockquote>mysterious &gt; ways...<br/>
<br/>
WARNING: People who are christian homeschoolers will probably not enjoy<br/>
it. <br/>
<br/>
However, much of our society is based on christian beleifs, and I found<br/>
it a good way to present and discuss this material with my daughter,<br/>
without &quot;teaching the bible&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-424427579">LOL I&#39;m a Christian and I got a kick out of it. It was pretty funny. But then, I haven&#39;t lost my sense of humor just because I found Christ. <br/>
