<div id="ygrps-yiv-1770966859">I am curious how this would work with truancy laws.  I am not in this<br/>
position, just curious.<br/>
<br/>
Oh and I don&#39;t think I officially sent an introduction to this group.<br/>
<br/>
I am Amanda.  I unschool my girls who are 7 and nearly 4.  We are in the<br/>
midst of an interesting transition over the next couple months.  I have been<br/>
a SAHM for four years.  I will be done with school in December and am going<br/>
back to work soon.  My dh has been in college PT for several years now and<br/>
is now in college online finishing up.  When I go back to work, he will be<br/>
home with the girls until he graduates at which time we will evaluate then<br/>
where we are going from there.<br/>
<br/>
We have been aware of the unschooling type of homeschooling since shortly<br/>
after I decided to homeschool 3 years ago, but I wasn&#39;t ready, unfortunately<br/>
for my children. I actually sent my oldest to preschool.  She loved it so I<br/>
sent her to Kindergarten.  She hated it so we pulled her out.  We tried some<br/>
school at home. She hated it.  Right now we have a good balance<br/>
<br/>
My youngest is currently in preschool (it&#39;s fun).  Somedays she goes, some<br/>
days she doesn&#39;t.  Its up to her, but I know that at some point doesn&#39;t<br/>
truancy become an issue?<br/>
<br/>
All in all, I am not a radical unschooler YET.  I still have things that I<br/>
need to let go of, but I do my best and I am growing everyday toward that.<br/>
I will probably mostly lurking on this list.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1981989725">Hi Amanda,<br/>
Ref: I am curious how this would work with truancy laws. I am not in this<br/>
position, just curious. ~<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re addressing me, but since I&#39;ve been through the system,<br/>
in Florida...  here&#39;s how it worked for us.<br/>
I paniced the first time I received one of their &#39;form&#39; letters.  I took it <br/>
to the attendence lady and she just informed me it was nothing but a form letter<br/>
as long as I sent in notes.  Which I did, lol, some of them rather funny like,<br/>
Caylee was absent today because we got stuck in a mudpuddle. (Really happened!)<br/>
<br/>
I also didn&#39;t hesitate to go remove my daughter from school when her horse wouldn&#39;t<br/>
get up.  I got her home ASAP,as she was the only one that horse would rise for.<br/>
<br/>
The school system never did more then send me that form letter which I receive near <br/>
every year.  My daughter&#39;s grades were never an issue and her test scores were high<br/>
so attendance just never seemed to matter.  Oh, at one point they asked for doctor&#39;s<br/>
notes no biggie.  <br/>
<br/>
The Florida System, what can I say?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1678465022">The last year that my oldest attended traditional schools she too<br/>
missed lots of days.... she maintained a straight A average and kept<br/>
up with any missed work.   At some point she had missed 20 of 22<br/>
&quot;allowable&quot; days and the school social worker and guidance counselor<br/>
called me in for a meeting to discuss her &quot;excessive&quot; absences.    I<br/>
told them I was amazed at how quickly they could be available for a<br/>
meeting when the entire previous year when my child had  a horrible<br/>
verbally/emotionally abusive teacher they didn&#39;t have time to discuss<br/>
THAT with me!    <br/>
I basically told them that if they were willing to retain a kid making<br/>
straight A&#39;s even though she was missing lots of days then I would be<br/>
happy to question that decision with the superintendent of schools.  <br/>
I always sent in a note and reminded them for the record that the<br/>
majority of the absences were from a horrible flu she caught from the<br/>
PRINCIPAL of the school (our neighbor!)  where they were both at home<br/>
and sick for 2 weeks then returned to school and relapsed and missed<br/>
another week, since we were neighbors he knew where she was and could<br/>
attest to her illness.  We did take &quot;mental health&quot; days and I did<br/>
write an excuse stating such.   We would take days to go to the NC<br/>
State fair, museums and so forth.   Every single absence was excused<br/>
for either illness or educational opportunity so they really could<br/>
only whine so much about it.    <br/>
I think the situation might have been different if she had missed lots<br/>
of days and not been keeping up in her schoolwork...she care about the<br/>
schoolwork she just didn&#39;t like to be AT SCHOOL.     <br/>
If I could give my kid back 2 years of her life that were miserable<br/>
because her mother was an idiot that would sure be the two I would choose!<br/>
