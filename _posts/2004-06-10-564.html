<div id="ygrps-yiv-1242014220">Hi all,<br/>
  My boys, 10 and 6, are keeping themselves so busy these days, I&#39;m beginning <br/>
to wonder if we are doing all this unschooling the right way?  I know, there <br/>
is no exact right way, but you know what I mean.  I read about people playing <br/>
games with their kids and mine just as soon play xbox then play anything with <br/>
mom!  Once in a while they&#39;ll get out a deck of cards or something, but its <br/>
rare when they do.  But when I say they are busy, they are BUSY!  Like I said, <br/>
xbox, tv, playing with the kittens, ALOT of what I call dramatic play (GIjoes, <br/>
army, nijas).  The oldest even fixes his and his brothers breakfast and lunch. <br/>
 He enjoys its, believe me, but its starting to give me a complex!  Am I not <br/>
needed anymore????  Are we doing this right?  Suggestions on going places or <br/>
doing things are usually met with opposition, but I do try.  So is all this <br/>
business OK?    <br/>
syndi---btw, people hate it when I tell them my kids never say the words I&#39;m <br/>
board!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-34702325">You are doing it sooooooo right! You&#39;ve created a home environment <br/>
where the kids are happy happy happy. They&#39;re too busy deciding what <br/>
*they* want to do to get bored. If you started suggesting things for <br/>
them to do instead, they&#39;d probably learn that &quot;I&#39;m bored,&quot; phrase <br/>
really fast. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve said it a million times; It&#39;s all about choice. <br/>
<br/>
Laurie never wanted to go anywhere either. She still loves being at <br/>
home when she has a day off. She announced on her lunch hour that <br/>
nothing short of a nuclear war could get her out of the house this <br/>
weekend. Uhm, but she called an hour ago to see if we all wanted to <br/>
go out to the comedy club on Saturday night to see improv. <br/>
<br/>
Whomever mentioned Whose Line Is It Anyway. The woman that owns the <br/>
comedy club here, Jen Kober, has taped a show with Whose Line. It <br/>
hasn&#39;t aired yet. <br/>
<br/>
love, Valerie <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-699104522">Everything is OK -- as a matter of fact, it sounds grand to me! :)<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking of my family today and thinking we were pretty strange. We <br/>
went to Orlando (a big deal around here -- we saved forever and had a wonderful <br/>
time!!) and did the Wet N Wild thing and the Universal thing. Had a blast. <br/>
<br/>
But when other families were trooping off to restaurants for dinner and <br/>
wandering (so the fliers said :) ) in the local mall-type place or going to the <br/>
show at some club-looking place across the street, we were tucked into a <br/>
family-style suite of rooms. Happily all together and making our own dinner and just <br/>
hanging out and watching TV and playing and swimming a little in the pool and <br/>
just being together. We did not feel this urge to &quot;do something.&quot; We were in a <br/>
different town but pretty much doing what we always do -- hanging out together.<br/>
<br/>
So we weren&#39;t seeing any sort of &quot;night life&quot; but we were happy. So are we <br/>
strange? Oh well. :)<br/>

Hi Syndi -- I knew someone else a while back at a (very) shortlived e-group for Moms (I don&#39;t even remember the name now, but it was just this past April).  Is that you?  I&#39;m asking because that Syndi was also an unschooler.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-121411995">Our family just hangs out together also....all the time.  Most of the year <br/>
its just my two kids, my husband and I.  We play board games alot, do house <br/>
projects, swim in the pool and just talk.  The neighbor kids hang out here alot <br/>
and play games with us.  Last night we had a group here....the three oldest made <br/>
waffles and eggs and put out fresh blueberries we had picked last <br/>
weekend...then a few more trickled in.  Alot of laughter and some of us played Cranium <br/>
and some were with their Neopets on the computer.   I love having them here and <br/>
next week my three stepkids ( 11,13 and 15) will join us for a month.<br/>
<br/>
I usually get up earlier than the kids and read the paper and have my coffee. <br/>
 Brenna comes in and reads the paper and then we have these discussions as <br/>
she reads and I am on the computer.   This morning, Logan came in also and we <br/>
talked about whether there is another place for someone else on Mount Rushmore, <br/>
if Reagan will be on the $20 bill,  and one of Dave Barry&#39;s pieces he is <br/>
listening to on tape.   My husband has a home office and he will come through <br/>
sometimes and put in his 2 cents.<br/>
<br/>
If we do go out, it&#39;s as a family....an occasional dinner or to a free <br/>
concert on the beach.  My husband and I realize how quickly they are growing up and <br/>
he and I will have lots of time with just the two of us.  With teenagers, it <br/>
just so nice that they enjoy being here and I really like these people!  There <br/>
is no one else I could imagining being as much fun to be with.<br/>

WEeelllll....this is another issue where it depends on circumstances and the unique family.<br/>
If I had one child, I think it would be really hard to make sense of leaving them alone. But I have four, and if dh and I want any kind of good relationship, we NEED time alone.<br/>
So it depends on the kids, the parents and the entire family dynamics.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;Course celebrations and just plain old dates are different. We tend to celebrate part of our anniversary with the entire family, and plan something short in the evening for just the two of us. Nothing wrong with that.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think parents should leave children if the child is stressed about it. I work as it is, so it&#39;s rare for us to leave the kids alone. But with four people needing attention and rides and conversations, I can tell you it&#39;s a whole different ballgame than parenting one child as far as energy and time go.<br/>
<br/>
I care very much about keeping our marriage healthy, and we don&#39;t get time to really connect and talk if we&#39;re all together. I don&#39;t think parents should feel guilty about spending time with spouses, as long as they aren&#39;t choosing one or the other (children or spouse).<br/>
If we go out, we talk to the kids about it ahead of time, we make sure it&#39;s ok with all parties involved and we get a fun movie/pizza, whatever makes their night fun too.<br/>
<br/>
The other night, Markus and I were going to sneak up to the bookstore for a coffee and chat. Sierra was very sad and asked us not to go...so we didn&#39;t. We talked to her about it and she asked if we could please go the next night. No problem.<br/>
Jalen is asleep, Trevor babysits. I can see where this might be a challenge in some families, but there&#39;s always time to talk or connect when the children fall asleep...dates at home are great too.:)<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s great if families take their kids everywhere, I also don&#39;t think it&#39;s always a bad thing to spend time alone. A healthy marriage needs some of that.<br/>

<h4>Nichole in Round Rock</h4>
<p><small><time>11 Jun 2004, at  6:48pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1444616105">Ren, I&#39;m glad you wrote that post.  I have just one precious child at this point, but my situation is unique in that my husband works 3.5 hours away from home all week in Dallas and is home on the weekends.  I&#39;m basically doing a single parent unschooling situation and it&#39;s hard sometimes.  When we were all together all the time, we wanted our daughter to be with us in all circumstances and felt weird when someone would ask us if we wanted them to babysit her while we went out for a birthday celebration or something like that.  Though we&#39;d still want to be together for such occasions, we are feeling more and more like we need some time alone.  It&#39;s difficult when Margaux misses her dad so much during the week and then asking her if we can have some time away from her, which we haven&#39;t done up to now.  We usually just take some time alone in the bedroom, which doesn&#39;t seem to bother her a bit, but there&#39;s more to reconnecting than just the physical.  Sure we could just sit in there and talk, but then that seems like a waste...;o)<br/>
<br/>
Right now, my husband is driving home and will be here in about an hour.  I have a feeling this weekend won&#39;t be any different than any other--we&#39;ll spend all our time together as a family doing fun things and enjoying our time, but by the end of the weekend, with saying goodbye again for another week, I always wish that we could have, just a few hours.... even now just writing this I feel guilty for thinking it.  Margaux will grow up so fast and then we&#39;ll wish to have her back again.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s confusing for me.  Margaux has never had a babysitter.  She has spent some time with unschooling families on the few occasions that were necessary for us to be away, but usually that was not time for us to be together, it was time when we were both running in different directions.<br/>
<br/>
Sigh...<br/>
<br/>
Is anyone else out there in this kind of boat?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks...<br/>
<br/>
Nichole<br/>

&quot;celebrations.&quot; <br/>

Ah ok. I thought maybe that&#39;s what you meant.:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-736688521">&quot;Is anyone else out there in this kind of boat?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Not anymore! But I&#39;ve been there.<br/>
Before we moved to Florida, my dh worked long hours away from home, made really good money in the summer and had time off in the winter. One season, he was only home Sat. night and Sunday, then back to work all week, so we didn&#39;t even get him for the whole weekend.<br/>
Those days, we didn&#39;t do stuff alone. We were always together as a family when he was home, it would have been too stressful for the kids otherwise, and I don&#39;t think either of us could have done it anyway!<br/>
<br/>
He quit that job, to start his own business so he could be with us more. I don&#39;t always like the money he makes (up and down), but it sure is nice to have him around so much and able to participate in family life again....it&#39;s been 6 years and I don&#39;t think he&#39;ll ever go back to working for someone else.<br/>
<br/>
What I recommend during this time in your lives, is to get REALLY creative. Work around when your child is asleep and plan some really cool home dates. You could set up an inflatable kiddie pool (make sure it has a drain that you could attach a rubber hose that reaches outside for after you&#39;re done) in the kitchen and have a &quot;jacuzzi&quot;night....complete with wine and finger food, all within reach.:)<br/>
Write him a note or leave a message during the week, about meeting you at a certain time or place in the house, have candles burning or whatever it is that helps you both relax and connect. It doesn&#39;t have to be about sex at all...it&#39;s about connecting, finding a special time/place to re-connect and talk. It CAN be done at home, you just have to plan ahead once in a while.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t stress about trying to go off alone somewhere, it&#39;s much too hard on children when they&#39;re already missing a parent. That&#39;s just my take...I think you can balance both needs.<br/>

<h4>Nichole in Round Rock</h4>
<p><small><time>12 Jun 2004, at 10:46am</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-890885370">Thanks, Ren,<br/>
<br/>
Very cool suggestion.  I guess ours will have to be a nice candle-lit early morning breakfast.  Margaux sleeps until about noon and is up until 2 am.  :o)<br/>
<br/>
I can hardly wait to tell Shahram about this.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you very much.<br/>
<br/>
:o)<br/>
