<div id="ygrps-yiv-418621346">First, sorry Kelly that you are having a problem getting your <br/>
response to me.  Maybe the rest of the list can help out.  <br/>
<br/>
My 12-YO son has CHOSEN to take several classes at the Junior High.  <br/>
He loves the show &quot;Ned&#39;s Declassified School Survival Guide&quot; and was <br/>
hoping junior high would be just like that(LOL).  <br/>
<br/>
Now he is saying that the computer class he is taking is boring and <br/>
he wants to quit.  Another complaint is that the teacher talks too <br/>
fast and he can&#39;t keep up with what he is saying.  This is my son <br/>
with Asperger&#39;s who has attentional difficulties...I asked him if he <br/>
wants to quit mainly because he is struggling with the work.  He said <br/>
no, that he also isn&#39;t enjoying the material.  Based on the hand-<br/>
outs, it is very dry learning.  He is enjoying the PE class (they&#39;re <br/>
rollerblading right now).<br/>
<br/>
If he quits, he will, of course, receive an F.  If he continues <br/>
wanting to take a class or two at the school over the years, and then <br/>
if he decides he doesn&#39;t want to finish the class, what effects will <br/>
be from Fs on his transcripts?  I don&#39;t want to force him to finish <br/>
the class, but I&#39;m not thrilled with him getting Fs either.  He says <br/>
he definitely wants to go to college.  I wish there was a grace <br/>
period where he could drop a class within several weeks or so without <br/>
getting an F.  As I recall, didn&#39;t they do that in college?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Trust me, colleges are much more interested in SAT and ACT scores than<br/>
they are transcripts.  And very few (if any) colleges even look at<br/>
middle school transcripts.  I didn&#39;t carry my middle school grades on<br/>
to college with me.<br/>
<br/>
Forcing him to finish the class just so he won&#39;t get an F isn&#39;t going<br/>
to benefit him in anyway.  If anything it is going to make learning<br/>
seem dull and horrid rather exciting and new.  You, yourself, have<br/>
noticed that the class is dull. Wasn&#39;t he taking these classes because<br/>
he had an interest in them?  Seems like the interest is gone.  Have<br/>
you truly explored all the options available.  You mention two:  drop<br/>
the class and fail or continue the class miserably.  What about a<br/>
third?  What about completing the classwork at home?  What about<br/>
talking to the instructor about the material or his dificulties in<br/>
keeping up with her fast talking?  What about exploring the same class<br/>
with a different (more interesting) instructor?  Does an F weigh more<br/>
than your son&#39;s joy?<br/>

he took classes - you can roll the ones he keeps into a transcript <br/>
that you write up for his college application. After all, taking a <br/>
class here and there does not equal graduating from the school. You <br/>
might consider having him take dual enrollment classes at a <br/>
community college instead - he&#39;d likely find it more challenging and <br/>
interesting and as you noted there is usually a couple weeks to drop <br/>
a class without it showing up at all on a transcript. After all, if <br/>
he stays in the class and is bored, he&#39;s just as likely to get an F <br/>
as if he drops it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1456421526">Interesting ideas...at the age of 12, can he take a community college <br/>
class?  If he fails at that level, however, won&#39;t the grades be known <br/>
later when he applies for college?  Sorry, but I am not very <br/>
knowledgeable about grades, transcripts, and getting into college.  <br/>
He was elementary age last year.    <br/>
<br/>
So, can he just keep the grades of the classes that he finishes to <br/>
put on college applications?  I agree that colleges are not going to <br/>
look at transcripts from middle school.  I was thinking before I <br/>
posted this, that an F at this level isn&#39;t a big deal.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for helping me with this Deb and Pam.<br/>

&quot;educational transcripts&quot; that colleges look through.  And even if he<br/>
did fail at the college level, any college he looks at would see that<br/>
he took it at such a young age.  And who knows, he may take the course<br/>
later in life and make an A or he may take the course now and make an<br/>
A *and* most colleges do have a &quot;withdraw without failing&quot; period<br/>
(which I used extensively when trying to pass college algebra :-) )<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Also quit thinking about letter grades in relation to unschooling.  So<br/>
he made an F.  Who cares?  Did he enjoy himself and did he get<br/>
anything out of it that he could use.  Those are the concerns that you<br/>
should have.  And there are other options to taking classes.  Find a<br/>
friend who is a computer geek (that&#39;s a compliment BTW in the computer<br/>
world) and ask if s/he could show your son a few things on the<br/>
computer.  Find a &quot;for Dummies&quot; that interests him (some, such as the<br/>
html one, even have CD-ROMs that go with them)  Shoot get one of those<br/>
Mr. Computer (or whatever his name is - they guy who offers a free<br/>
learning program for first time users) learning sets (just pay<br/>
shipping and handling LOL!)<br/>
<br/>
there are more options than school and not school.<br/>

one thing!<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s great that he&#39;s trying school so he knows from personal  <br/>
experience what it&#39;s like. But he shouldn&#39;t see it as his only  <br/>
resource. Inundate him with possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
And if you&#39;re way out away from things and there aren&#39;t a lot of  <br/>
opportunities, make them! :-) Find people who are willing to share  <br/>
the things they love.<br/>

YOU are going to write his transcript. YOU get to put in whatever you feel like putting in there!There is no nationwide school transcript office that keeps track of every thing your children do.<br/>
Here&#39;s something the schools don&#39;t want you to know: There is NO SUCH THING as a &quot;Permanent Record&quot; &lt;gasp!&gt;<br/>
Think of a transcript as a resume. A resume essentially &quot;sells&quot; someone. It point out strengths pertaining to the goal. One person may want to point out different things they&#39;ve done based on who the audience is. For example, as a waitress, I would talk up my speed and accuracy when applying to a 200 seat diner, but  highlight my knowledge of etiquette  and fine ingredients when applying to a 40 seat French restaurant.<br/>
In the case of a kid who wants to go to college, you would make different transcripts bases on where he is going, why he is going,  (ie Harvard vs. one of those cool make your own course of study colleges.<br/>
But at this point, I would just take a year off and not worry about this stuff AT ALL.<br/>
