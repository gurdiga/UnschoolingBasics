<div id="ygrps-yiv-543098557">My mother-in-law called this evening to tell me that she has been <br/>
thinking seriously about something that I really needed to consider.  <br/>
She asked me what would become of my children if something were to <br/>
happen to me.  She was concerned that my kids would then have to go to <br/>
school and that it would be hard for them to adjust when they have <br/>
never had any school-type experiences.  <br/>
<br/>
I told her that I didn&#39;t think living a life of what if&#39;s was a very <br/>
good way to live.  I said that if something were to happen to me, then <br/>
my children would have wonderful memories of our times spent together <br/>
every day doing things we love and living life joyfully.  What a sad <br/>
thing it would be if something happened to me and my children had very <br/>
few memories of us spending time together.  <br/>

My  mother-in-law called this evening to tell me that she has been <br/>
thinking  seriously about something that I really needed to consider.  <br/>
She  asked me what would become of my children if something were to <br/>
happen to  me.  She was concerned that my kids would then have to go to <br/>
school  and that it would be hard for them to adjust when they have <br/>
never had any  school-type experiences. <br/>
I think that is a reasonable concern, personally. I know I need to make  sure <br/>
that if something happened to myself and to my DH, that the kids will be in  <br/>
a place as similar as possible to what they&#39;ve been with. they need good,  <br/>
loving, kind, gentle guardians that will honor what I have begun. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I told her that I didn&#39;t think living a life of what if&#39;s was a  very <br/>
good way to live.  <br/>
And I agree. <br/>
<br/>
I said  that if something were to happen to me, then <br/>
my children would have  wonderful memories of our times spent together <br/>
every day doing things we  love and living life joyfully.  <br/>
Thank goodness, huh? That makes ME glad to - for you, for me, for all of us  <br/>
that have been able to give that out to the children we love so much. <br/>
<br/>
What a  sad <br/>
thing it would be if something happened to me and my children had very  <br/>
few memories of us spending time together.<br/>
Makes me teary. I totally agree. But I ALSO don&#39;t see a huge &quot;what-if&quot;  <br/>
lifestyle happening from being a bit pragmatic about the future. We all will  die. <br/>
We don&#39;t know when. I know I want my kids to be covered and protected and  <br/>
safe and in an area of love and as close as possible to what they&#39;ve been  <br/>
accustomed to. I think it makes sense to plan for potential issues, but not to  live <br/>
in Fear or in a What-if state. I think that balance can be achieved :) <br/>

It&#39;s a myth.<br/>
If something happened to you then your kids are going to have a hard<br/>
time period! <br/>

My always unschooled nephew decided to go to high school. He&#39;s gotten<br/>
straight A&#39;s all year and decided school is a waste of time for the<br/>
most part and is only taking one or two classes of interest next year.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a myth that more school prepares you to do better in school. It&#39;s<br/>
a myth that the foremost concern would be adaptation to school if a<br/>
parent dies. I agree that &quot;what if&#39;s&quot; are NOT a good way to make<br/>
joyful decisions for today&#39;s reality.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1159445147">Simon and Linnaea are taking their first classes right now. Linnaea has had two Kung Fu classes and Simon had his first last night. They are interested, engaged and attentive. Simon is amazingly focused. It was  fascinating to watch him in comparison with the couple of other kids in the class. He listened to direction, practiced what the instructor was saying as he waited his turn. He spoke up and asked for a bit of clarifying if he needed it. He was interested. If he&#39;d been taking classes all of his life and this was just another one, I don&#39;t think he would be as confident or as engaged as he is. Linnaea is a little less interested in Kung Fu than is Simon, she is doing it for the fun of the movement and is much less concerned with picking up the specifics. If he was doing this to demonstrate to others something, maybe to pad out his college application, or to deal with bullies, I don&#39;t think that his excitement would be so obvious, his joy so great. If<br/>
 he was doing this for me or for David there would be none of the passion that he is showing. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you can prepare someone for the misery that would come from being orphaned as a child. I don&#39;t think being inoculated with school experience would help them to buffer against those emotional storms. I think the OP is absolutely right that it is better to line their lives with glorious memories of connection and love and kindness than to make sure that if the worst happens they are prepared. You can&#39;t be prepared, you have to wing it. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>**Indeed!! That is what I would say to her. Memories of mama are FAR more<br/>
important than &quot;school just-in-case&quot; not to mention FAR more kind, as well<br/>
:)<br/>
Hayden has few memories of his dad, who died when he was 2 (and *surprise* I<br/>
didn&#39;t put him in school!!!) -- I wish he had more, though at least he has<br/>
my stories of when his dad was the stay-home parent and memories of them<br/>
together.  He has some really cool &quot;emotional&quot; memories of his dad, usually<br/>
when he&#39;s really happy he&#39;ll remember feeling that way in his dad&#39;s<br/>
presence. Lately, when he wrestles with Scotty (our Super Cool Boyfriend) he<br/>
has some flashes of how fun it was to &quot;rassle&quot; with Mitch. Priceless.<br/>
When my dd, Hannah, died at 9.5 (having never gone to school and spending<br/>
maybe a grand total of two weeks, in total hours, separated from me), my<br/>
best friend&#39;s dd, then 17, figured out that between daycare and school she<br/>
had spent an entire 9.5 years separated from her mama. Yeah, they&#39;re lucky<br/>
to still have each other, they&#39;ll still never ever be able to get that time<br/>
back & time together diminishes greatly the older ZoAnne becomes... I, on<br/>
the other hand, have *no* regrets about having 9.5 years of amazing memories<br/>
of Hannah. AND Hayden is lucky to have had an entire 7.5 years with his<br/>
sister, on his team, in the house, us together... how many memories of her<br/>
would he have if she&#39;d/they&#39;d been shipped off to school?? Not the same<br/>
quantity, nor the same quality... I&#39;m all about quality :) (I&#39;m done being<br/>
hung up on quantity!!!)<br/>
