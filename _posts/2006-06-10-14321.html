<div id="ygrps-yiv-845129582">&quot;Also, she&#39;s an introvert, hates transitions and new places etc.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My dd is also like that, but she came w/ me to the Northeast Unschooling Conference a few weeks ago.  She liked the idea of staying in a fancy hotel for a couple of days.  :-)  I gave her the option of venturing out of our room or not...I left that entirely up to her.  When we first got there, she didn&#39;t want to leave the room (she was very happy to watch TV and hang out w/ her stuffed dog), but within a couple of hours she had hooked up w/ a friend, met two new friends, and was having fun.  I think she went swimming in the hotel pool at least a dozen times in a 24 hour period.  ;-)  She even had a friend sleep over in our room that first night!  So...who knows?  Your dd just might surprise you.  :-)<br/>
