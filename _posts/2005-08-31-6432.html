<div id="ygrps-yiv-642745030">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I have a question for some of you wise women.  I don&#39;t know if you have <br/>
covered this topic or not but it&#39;s pretty real for me right now so I <br/>
would like your opinion.  We&#39;re in the process of starting a Spiral <br/>
Scouts group and I&#39;m having second thoughts about it because of the use <br/>
of badges/pins.  To me it is an extrinsic motivator and I don&#39;t get why <br/>
the kids need to do the badges.  I would love the kids to do the <br/>
activities without getting a reward.  Maybe I&#39;ve been influenced too <br/>
much by Alfie Kohn but I don&#39;t understand why everybody doesn&#39;t think <br/>
like me.  :-)   Since I&#39;m sure some of you unschoolers wouldn&#39;t have a <br/>
problem with it, I would like to hear your opinions.  Some people say <br/>
that the badge is just for remembering what a good time they had in <br/>
scouting but I think photographs would do the trick.  I&#39;m trying to <br/>
convince myself that it is okay because I don&#39;t want to cause any <br/>
friction in the group but I feel like I&#39;m always compromising my <br/>
beliefs to make everybody happy.  On the other hand, is it really that <br/>
big of a deal if they would get badges/pins?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-31476067">I think it depends - for you/your kid(s) are the badges a &#39;reward&#39; or <br/>
a marker? They could simply be a &#39;bookmark&#39; of where they&#39;ve been, a <br/>
reference to say &quot;oh yeah I remember that, let&#39;s go look at the <br/>
pictures from when...&quot; If they are the ones choosing (or at least <br/>
having a say in) which badges to do - whatever looks interesting <br/>
perhaps - then I wouldn&#39;t have a question with it. If, however, it&#39;s a <br/>
carrot to get them to do &quot;good for you&quot; stuff, then that&#39;s different. <br/>
If it&#39;s one of those things that you guys can just do the stuff and <br/>
toss the badge in a drawer or something, fine. If it becomes an issue, <br/>
then maybe not.<br/>
<br/>
So, it could go either way<br/>
