&lt;&lt; Perhaps some could recommend reputable animal sites<br/>
 that allow people to link from a site to their site?  &gt;&gt;</div>

 </span></blockquote>My dd (13) loves wolves!  We found the wolf mountain site when <br/>
searching a while back and someday when we visit CA (we&#39;re in MA) we <br/>
plan to visit!   There&#39;s one here in MA but you have to be 18 to <br/>
volunteer (and 16 most other places to volunteer, animal shelters etc, <br/>
liability I imagine), but from what I read, wolf mountain lets you <br/>
interact somewhat with the wolves.  Have you been there much?  We&#39;d <br/>
love to hear of your experiences (feel free to email me off list!).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>****I read a book yrs. ago called &quot;Never Cry Wolf&quot; by Farley Mowat (a <br/>
favorite of mine:o) which was then turned into a movie, I think it&#39;s a Disney one. <br/>
AWESOME true story about wolves, man and the Canadian Government. As always, the <br/>
book is way better but the movie is pretty great too. If you haven&#39;t already <br/>
read it or seen the movie, I would do both! ****<br/>

****We used to volunteer at a local rescue (for dogs and cats) and they <br/>
allowed my girls, then, 10 and 11 to help also. I think it was because they knew me <br/>
well though. We are now checking into volunteering at our local Humane Soc. <br/>
They will allow kids to come with their families and help after you go through <br/>
their orientation, (I think they let you do things like walk the dogs) as long <br/>
as the kids are with an adult. But that&#39;s just with cats and dogs, not <br/>
wolves! &lt;g&gt; ****<br/>
