<div id="ygrps-yiv-2075885359"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; This is the sort of thing I would like to participate in on lists  <br/>
&gt; like this.. You tell me how it is for you, I tell you how it is for  <br/>
&gt; me, we share ideas, compare notes and leave the elitism and  <br/>
&gt; judgment out of it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I just had a revelation. Many people have said over the years that  <br/>
they want a list where everyone shares what they do and no one is  <br/>
judged. Obviously it&#39;s a need being unmet.<br/>
<br/>
The problem with creating such a list is that, after an initial  <br/>
flurry, people won&#39;t write! I&#39;ve seen it happen over and over from  <br/>
lists that branched off from UnschoolingDiscussion when people wanted  <br/>
to create that kind of list. It *sounds* like a great idea. It sounds  <br/>
like meeting regularly with friends to just share and swap stories.  <br/>
Cool!<br/>
<br/>
(And if you *do* have a viable list please post it! So people can get  <br/>
that need met! *No one* wants people to stay on the list because they  <br/>
think this is the only option beginners have. Regular contributors  <br/>
*do* want people to &quot;get&quot; unschooling because we think it&#39;s a great  <br/>
idea! We would like people to be able to find a resource that works  <br/>
for them.)<br/>
<br/>
When was the last time you wrote a letter to a friend just telling  <br/>
about the things going on in your life? Could you do that several  <br/>
times a week?<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that when we invest time in something, we need to  <br/>
receive something of equal value in return. This is true of anything  <br/>
we invest time in in our lives. The return might be a feeling of  <br/>
satisfaction. It might be feeling good about having helped someone.  <br/>
It might be information. It might be sharing time with friends. It  <br/>
might be accomplishing a task. It might be ... whatever floats your  <br/>
boat :-)<br/>
<br/>
The problem with the type of list many people have said they want is  <br/>
that it doesn&#39;t return as much as it takes *from the writers*. For  <br/>
people to spend time writing -- so there&#39;s something for others to  <br/>
read! --, the writers must have a need that gets fulfilled *by  <br/>
writing*. The need can&#39;t be fulfilled just from reading. If that need  <br/>
can be met just by reading, when they&#39;re done reading their internal  <br/>
prioritizer starts sending out red alerts about things that would be  <br/>
offering better returns for the time invested. ;-) &quot;Laundry ... Take  <br/>
kids to park ... Read a book ... Watch TV ... Go pick up furnace  <br/>
filters ...&quot; (And if you don&#39;t have a pile of other things you could  <br/>
be doing then you&#39;re probably not a mom and probably not an  <br/>
unschooler! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I spend a lot of time writing. I *could* spend that time reading, or  <br/>
drawing, or cleaning, or exercising, or sleeping. (I get up very  <br/>
early to avoid stealing family time.) I *choose* to spend that time  <br/>
writing because I get something valuable back from it. I love  <br/>
writing. I love crafting words. I love trying to make complex things  <br/>
simple. I could spend the time writing for magazines and get  <br/>
paid! :-) But I choose to write answers for posts because the return  <br/>
I get is a sense that my thinking is getting clearer and I don&#39;t get  <br/>
that same satisfaction from other things or even other types of  <br/>
writing. I don&#39;t know why others write. But whatever they&#39;re getting  <br/>
back, it&#39;s something that&#39;s important enough to set aside time for.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a great idea to think of people trading stories about what&#39;s  <br/>
going on in their lives, but it takes time to write up stories. And  <br/>
the people writing the stories need to get something back for the  <br/>
time it takes to write that they can&#39;t get if they don&#39;t write.<br/>
<br/>
I think what people are wanting in a list is a coffee klatch, a get- <br/>
together with people of like mind to swap bits of their lives. Sounds  <br/>
cool. In real life people can get together to swap bits of their  <br/>
lives because they have some connection with each other. The point  <br/>
isn&#39;t the stories, the point is sharing with friends or others you  <br/>
share a bond with. But people can&#39;t just jump onto a list and find  <br/>
that, unfortunately. It&#39;s going to be a rare confluence of people who  <br/>
all click and all feel a passion for writing about their lives to the  <br/>
point where they&#39;re willing to set aside an hour or more of their  <br/>
lives several times a week.<br/>
<br/>
Pam Sorooshian started a really cool list a couple of years ago. It&#39;s  <br/>
called UnschoolingStories. It&#39;s just, as it says in the description,  <br/>
&quot;stories of how unschooling works. We&#39;ll learn from each other by  <br/>
sharing experiences and observations. It is not a discussion list,  <br/>
not a debate list, and not really even a &quot;support&quot; or &quot;advice&quot; list.&quot;  <br/>
Cool! And yet there were a total of 5 posts last year. Not because  <br/>
the idea is bad. It&#39;s a great idea. It&#39;s that there isn&#39;t enough  <br/>
return for the time invested in writing. In fact there isn&#39;t enough  <br/>
return to even forward a post written for another list. (If there  <br/>
were, people would do it!)<br/>
<br/>
The reason discussion lists like UnschoolingDiscussion and  <br/>
UnschoolingBasics (and I assume AlwaysUnschooled) is that the writers  <br/>
are getting back something they feel is valuable to them for the time  <br/>
they invest in writing. Part is they&#39;re helping build something they  <br/>
passionately believe in. The other part is undoubtedly personal to  <br/>
each person. People *will* find it a valuable use of  time writing  <br/>
about their problems. People *will* find it a valuable use of time to  <br/>
answer when they feel their answer is helping to build something  <br/>
they&#39;re passionate about.<br/>
<br/>
For those who want the coffee klatch type of list you need to create  <br/>
something that people *need* to write for. Not just read! Not just  <br/>
want to write for! *Need* to write for. Something they&#39;re willing to  <br/>
set an hour or so of their life aside to contribute to.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra Dodd has sort of a coffee klatch list: AlwaysLearning, for  <br/>
those who already get unschooling to just talk about their lives. A  <br/>
fair number of the posts are similar to UnschoolingDiscussion: people  <br/>
bringing in problems they&#39;re having getting unschooling. If you take  <br/>
away those there wouldn&#39;t be many posts left. The rest is mostly  <br/>
Sandra and occasionally others offering &quot;Here&#39;s something that&#39;s  <br/>
cool.&quot; It might be a slice of life or philosophy or idea or website  <br/>
and some discussion afterwards. But it works not because it&#39;s a  <br/>
coffee klatch but because the people there like Sandra and the  <br/>
atmosphere she can create. They come for that. If they don&#39;t like  <br/>
Sandra or the atmosphere they shouldn&#39;t come! The list works not  <br/>
because it&#39;s a trading of ideas but because of Sandra.<br/>
<br/>
They say if you build it, they will come ;-) But it takes more than  <br/>
just creating a list to build something that people want to come to.  <br/>
It needs to provide something people want to read. That part might  <br/>
come from a strong personality who just likes to write that people  <br/>
enjoy reading :-) (Blogs!) It needs to provide something people want  <br/>
to write for. And that&#39;s harder.<br/>
<br/>
I think a list like that could work if there were a strong  <br/>
personality behind a list (or message board) like that. Someone who  <br/>
felt passionate enough about it to write even when no one was  <br/>
responding. Creating something that others would not only love to  <br/>
read but love to contribute to.<br/>
<br/>
I think it could work *maybe* if there were a weekly topic. Maybe  <br/>
people would overcome the downsides of a mish mosh of philosophies if  <br/>
there were a specific topic to write about. But again I think it  <br/>
would take someone with a passion about the project and a  strong  <br/>
personality to drum up interest to keep it going. That&#39;s just a guess.<br/>
<br/>
This list works because of the passion of Ren and Kelly and the  <br/>
passion of the people willing to set aside time to write for  <br/>
something they believe in. If the list is changed to something they  <br/>
don&#39;t believe in -- eg, swapping solutions to problems from different  <br/>
perspectives -- most of the writers would leave. Not because they&#39;re  <br/>
snooty! But because it&#39;s no longer a project they believe in. It  <br/>
*seems* like if you&#39;d get rid of the so called &quot;elitists&quot; and those  <br/>
who have a strangle hold on ideas then lots more people would be able  <br/>
to speak up and then you&#39;d have the lovely open community for people  <br/>
to share freely in. :-)<br/>
<br/>
But it doesn&#39;t work. Why? People *have* created lists for people to  <br/>
share.<br/>
<br/>
To create a vibrant list, you need to think about what makes people  <br/>
want -- no, *need* as in put at the top of their priority list -- to  <br/>
write things that others find worth reading.<br/>
<br/>
How can someone create an open community for people to share that  <br/>
others *need* to write something others want to read? That&#39;s the  <br/>
question you need to answer to create a non-judgemental unschooling  <br/>
list that works.<br/>
<br/>
*I* don&#39;t know the answer! But I do know how to create a list around  <br/>
a very specific philosophy that people feel passionate about ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; No two families are going to run exactly the same way. Why not  <br/>
&gt; embrace our commonalities and accept our differences respectfully?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In real life I accept differences -- within my comfort level --  <br/>
respectfully. Most people I know in real life parent traditionally  <br/>
and send their kids to school. My purpose in interacting with them is  <br/>
to be friendly, not proselytize.<br/>
<br/>
But here on this list are people who&#39;ve come asking &quot;I want to  <br/>
unschool, but I&#39;ve got these problems.&quot; That&#39;s what this list is  <br/>
*for*. And that&#39;s something I feel strongly enough about to help  <br/>
contribute to. It&#39;s a valuable use of my time. It&#39;s not a gathering  <br/>
place for beginning unschoolers to swap what they&#39;re trying out.  <br/>
Though I understand why people would like to have that.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t feel passionate about helping to build a place that&#39;s a mish  <br/>
mosh of philosophies. And in order to create a viable open forum like  <br/>
that, you need people passionate enough about that idea to write for it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; When folks ask for it and do my best to be understanding and not to  <br/>
&gt; pass judgment on them when they say things I whole-heartedly<br/>
&gt; disagree with like, &quot;well I don&#39;t recycle because it&#39;s really a  <br/>
&gt; waste of time and it makes no difference anyways.&quot; I have found I  <br/>
&gt; have reached more people this way. I feel far more people have  <br/>
&gt; considered my notions on these topics because I have not copped an  <br/>
&gt; overly confident (elitist) attitude.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that&#39;s great for creating peace and harmony in our social lives.<br/>
<br/>
But peace and harmony don&#39;t light a big enough fire under people to  <br/>
spend their valuable time writing about it. ;-) And lists need writers!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2043434954">I loved your entire post Joyce. Great insight on what makes the lists<br/>
tick.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;ve found from several of these spin-off lists that struggle to<br/>
create a &quot;non-judgemental&quot; haven, is they exist mostly to bash other<br/>
lists, like this one. Not so non-judgemental in the end...just THEIR<br/>
version of judgement.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s similar to what happens in some UU congregations. People are  <br/>
so happy and relieved to find a place where there are people who have  <br/>
had similar problems with Christianity (usually) that the atmosphere  <br/>
becomes anti-Christian. That becomes the tie that binds people  <br/>
together :-/ The passion that drives them to write is their common  <br/>
dislike.<br/>
<br/>
But then what? That&#39;s where the lists (and UU congregations ;-) seem  <br/>
to flounder. They can&#39;t find a common passion in just writing and  <br/>
reading about how hard it is to unschool and parent and their little  <br/>
baby steps and bits about their lives.<br/>

Description: This is a place to exchange stories from our unschooling  <br/>
lives. Describe how your child learned to read. Tell us anecdotes of  <br/>
how your child made unexpected connections. How does your child learn  <br/>
math through play and everyday activities?<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is &quot;not schooling.&quot; This list is for stories of how  <br/>
unschooling works. We&#39;ll learn from each other by sharing experiences  <br/>
and observations.  It is not a discussion list, not a debate list,  <br/>
and not really even an &quot;advice&quot; list.<br/>
<br/>
********<br/>
<br/>
Highly underutilized. People RARELY post to it. But it is there and  <br/>
this is exactly what it is for. There are 149 people on the list, but  <br/>
they don&#39;t post anything.<br/>
<br/>
I can only conclude that many people like the idea, but they really  <br/>
prefer to post on the discuss and debate style lists.<br/>
<br/>
As list owner, I might be able to encourage more posting on the  <br/>
UnschoolingStories list, I suppose. But I, personally, don&#39;t feel  <br/>
passionately about regularly sharing anecdotes about our lives just  <br/>
for the sake of sharing anecdotes - I&#39;d rather share them in the  <br/>
context of making a philosophical point about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If anybody else would really like to make that list more active,  <br/>
write to me offlist and we&#39;ll talk about how to do it.<br/>

to share freely in. :-)<br/>
<br/>
But it doesn&#39;t work. Why? People *have* created lists for people to <br/>
share.<br/>
<br/>
To create a vibrant list, you need to think about what makes people <br/>
want -- no, *need* as in put at the top of their priority list -- to <br/>
write things that others find worth reading.<br/>
<br/>
How can someone create an open community for people to share that <br/>
others *need* to write something others want to read? That&#39;s the <br/>
question you need to answer to create a non-judgemental unschooling <br/>
list that works.<br/>
<br/>
*I* don&#39;t know the answer! But I do know how to create a list around <br/>
a very specific philosophy that people feel passionate about ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; No two families are going to run exactly the same way. Why not <br/>
&gt; embrace our commonalities and accept our differences respectfully?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In real life I accept differences -- within my comfort level -- <br/>
respectfully. Most people I know in real life parent traditionally <br/>
and send their kids to school. My purpose in interacting with them is <br/>
to be friendly, not proselytize.<br/>
<br/>
But here on this list are people who&#39;ve come asking &quot;I want to <br/>
unschool, but I&#39;ve got these problems.&quot; That&#39;s what this list is <br/>
*for*. And that&#39;s something I feel strongly enough about to help <br/>
contribute to. It&#39;s a valuable use of my time. It&#39;s not a gathering <br/>
place for beginning unschoolers to swap what they&#39;re trying out. <br/>
Though I understand why people would like to have that.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t feel passionate about helping to build a place that&#39;s a mish <br/>
mosh of philosophies. And in order to create a viable open forum like <br/>
that, you need people passionate enough about that idea to write for it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; When folks ask for it and do my best to be understanding and not to <br/>
&gt; pass judgment on them when they say things I whole-heartedly<br/>
&gt; disagree with like, &quot;well I don&#39;t recycle because it&#39;s really a <br/>
&gt; waste of time and it makes no difference anyways.&quot; I have found I <br/>
&gt; have reached more people this way. I feel far more people have <br/>
&gt; considered my notions on these topics because I have not copped an <br/>
&gt; overly confident (elitist) attitude.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that&#39;s great for creating peace and harmony in our social lives.<br/>
<br/>
But peace and harmony don&#39;t light a big enough fire under people to <br/>
spend their valuable time writing about it. ;-) And lists need writers!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2013171166"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Pam Sorooshian started a really cool list a couple of years ago. It&#39;s  <br/>
&gt; called UnschoolingStories. It&#39;s just, as it says in the description,  <br/>
&gt; &quot;stories of how unschooling works. We&#39;ll learn from each other by  <br/>
&gt; sharing experiences and observations. It is not a discussion list,  <br/>
&gt; not a debate list, and not really even a &quot;support&quot; or &quot;advice&quot; list.&quot;  <br/>
&gt; Cool! And yet there were a total of 5 posts last year. Not because  <br/>
&gt; the idea is bad. It&#39;s a great idea. It&#39;s that there isn&#39;t enough  <br/>
&gt; return for the time invested in writing. In fact there isn&#39;t enough  <br/>
&gt; return to even forward a post written for another list. (If there  <br/>
&gt; were, people would do it!)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>These reasons are very clear and understandable, at the same time<br/>
there were those 5 people who wrote stories :). When I will have<br/>
personal unschooling stories, I am sure I&#39;ll be happy to share them.<br/>
Although, I understand that there can always be such reasons, like<br/>
quoted below :) = &quot;things got busy and I haven&#39;t posted there&quot;.<br/>

&gt; stories all in one place from all kinds of people - people with lots of<br/>
&gt; kids, people with one kid, people leaping... &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If some of you have time maybe you could put some stories there and we<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The reason I am writing this message right now is my hope that as<br/>
people read this topic again, there might be a couple more stories<br/>
appear on the UnschoolingStories list :). <br/>
<br/>
It is not very easy to find such stories here, in UnschoolingBasics,<br/>
among a huge pile of messages, where people are telling about their<br/>
problems, asking for help, meeting each other, etc. It is not that<br/>
easy to extract such short personal stories from books, websites and<br/>
even blogs about unschooling and by unschoolers. But such stories do<br/>
help! Do help to understand better how unschooling works :).<br/>
<br/>
I hope that such stories would also help me to convince my dh to<br/>
unschool our daughter (now almost 18 months) and our future children.<br/>
<br/>
Please, share your stories in UnschoolingStories Group if you have<br/>
time and wish! Thank you very very much!<br/>
