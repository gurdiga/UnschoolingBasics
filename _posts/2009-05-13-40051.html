<div id="ygrps-yiv-2030768269">We&#39;ve found a great letterboxing website <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.atlasquest.com/">http://www.atlasquest.com/</a>  <br/>
which I wanted to share with others who might enjoy it.  They are  <br/>
hosting a &quot;plant a letterbox&quot; day.  The idea is to plant a letterbox  <br/>
and upload it on May 24th to their website in order to try to crash  <br/>
their site.  We&#39;ve enjoyed letterboxing and thought this might add an  <br/>
extra challenge.  If you don&#39;t know about letterboxing this website  <br/>
does a great job describing it.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun,<br/>

Plant a Letterbox Day is back! Each year, we try to plant as many  <br/>
boxes as we can on May 24th in a feabile attempt to &#39;crash&#39; Atlas  <br/>
Quest. We haven&#39;t crashed it yet, but it sure is fun trying! So plant  <br/>
your boxes, list them on May 24th, and join the fun!<br/>
