<div id="ygrps-yiv-448930823">It used to be that there were only *two* unschooling lists, <br/>
unschoolingdotcom @ yahoo and unschooling.com message boards (before <br/>
THAT, only one---the aol list). Now there are *dozens* of <br/>
national/international lists and *hundreds* of local/state lists.<br/>
<br/>
The wonderful thing about just two lists is that *everyone* could read <br/>
there and get all the cool posts all the time (sometimes 600/day! &lt;g&gt;). <br/>
Now fabulous posts can end up on a list you&#39;re not on. I&#39;m on 58 <br/>
unschooling elists----and NO, I don&#39;t read all of them every day! &lt;G&gt; <br/>
But I get mail from many daily and I read *at* the sites of others when <br/>
things are slow-ish.<br/>
<br/>
If I see something that&#39;s just too good to leave on one list, I&#39;ll try <br/>
to share it on others. Here&#39;s *another* brilliant post by Joyce over at <br/>
AlwaysLearning.<br/>

<br/>
But you do want to! This is one of those mental shifts. You want your<br/>
kids to only eat as many sweets as you think are good for them. And<br/>
you want what you think to be right. So in your mind you do have a<br/>
limit. You just don&#39;t want to be the sweets Nazi. You want the kids<br/>
to internalize what you believe is right and limit themselves.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; If my child wants to eat them all the day I made them, do I let him?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What will happen if he does eat them all in one day?<br/>
<br/>
What if you make another batch and he eats that too? What will happen?<br/>
<br/>
If you buy ten bags of flour and keep making batches of cookies, how<br/>
many do you think he&#39;ll eat? All of them?<br/>
<br/>
If you do that every day, do you think he&#39;d keep eating cookies<br/>
everyday until he exploded?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; And he will, because *I&#39;VE* done it!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why do you think he and you are the same person? Does he like the<br/>
exact same things you do? Does he dislike the exact same things as<br/>
you do?<br/>
<br/>
Just because something is possible, doesn&#39;t mean it will happen.<br/>
<br/>
Just because we gave birth to them, doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re our clones.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect you know all that. I&#39;m telling you the obvious *but*<br/>
sometimes our fears can override our common sense. We&#39;ll set aside<br/>
what makes sense to do some voodoo just to make sure some possible<br/>
bad thing doesn&#39;t happen.<br/>
<br/>
And questions make us squirm. We don&#39;t have the textbook and we<br/>
didn&#39;t study. What if we get the answer wrong???<br/>
<br/>
I knew I couldn&#39;t be trusted around candy. I had proof. I opened up a<br/>
bag of Halloween candy before Halloween and in 2 or 3 days, 3 bags of<br/>
candy were gone.<br/>
<br/>
But actually what I had proof of is how I react to deprivation. I<br/>
didn&#39;t buy candy except at Halloween. It was the only time I could<br/>
get it so *of course* I packed in as much as I could before it<br/>
disappeared for another year.<br/>
<br/>
So I gave myself permission to have candy. If I finished one bag<br/>
(Almond M&Ms were irresistible at the time) I promised myself I could<br/>
have another. It did take 3 bags! but I did get over the craving. We<br/>
now buy bags of Dove milk chocolate miniatures and have Ghirardelli<br/>
chocolate bits in the freezer. And I can go days without eating any.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Or do we just all dig in a finish it in a day and then wait for a few <br/>
days to make more?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why wait a few days? Make 4 dozen.<br/>
<br/>
If you were thirsty would you have only one sip today then another<br/>
tomorrow even though there&#39;s an unlimited amount coming from the tap?<br/>
<br/>
You  *could* drink water by the gallon. Do you? *Is* it just because<br/>
water isn&#39;t as tasty as cookies? Most people would say that&#39;s true<br/>
but most people don&#39;t have a tap of running cookies freely<br/>
accessible ;-) So they&#39;re making assumptions without actually<br/>
testing. They don&#39;t know what they&#39;re like when cookies are as easy<br/>
to get as water. They only know what they&#39;re like when cookies appear<br/>
like an oasis in a desert.<br/>
<br/>
(And if the obvious conclusion was always the true answer, no one<br/>
would have ever questioned whether the sun goes around the earth,<br/>
since we can see that it does, plain as day! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; My kids eat plenty of good stuff, but I don&#39;t know how to make sure <br/>
they don&#39;t get too many sweets.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t know because you&#39;re using your external monitor to judge<br/>
what&#39;s going on inside of someone else. Of course you can&#39;t know. So<br/>
parents make wild guesses. Or use their &quot;gut instinct&quot;. Or look to<br/>
experts to pass on their wild guesses or gut instincts so parents<br/>
don&#39;t have to be wrong.<br/>
<br/>
*If* we couldn&#39;t self regulate, *if* we needed experts to tell us<br/>
what we should and shouldn&#39;t eat, how would our species have survived<br/>
long enough to create experts?<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a mainstream article in the NY Times about eating that was<br/>
actually very close to what we discuss here:<br/>

6 Food Mistakes Parents Make<br/>

<br/>
&gt; do you only have a certain number of cookies available for that day <br/>
(for everyone, not just the kids...)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something Pam wrote about TV but it applies to food and<br/>
everything else too. Which is the really cool thing about philosophy!<br/>
The principles that work in one area can make our view of another<br/>
area clearer.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; In other words, will they stop eating 5 at a time if the cookies are <br/>
there and available,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Again, what will happen if they eat 5 at a time? What if they eat a<br/>
dozen? Your fears are stopping you from doing ... what exactly? Think<br/>
about it! Really. Do you fear that if you let them eat 5 dozen<br/>
cookies that they won&#39;t ever eat anything else?<br/>
<br/>
I suspect the questions are sounding snarky as though I&#39;m saying &quot;Are<br/>
you so dim as to believe what conventional parents believe?&quot; But they<br/>
aren&#39;t. They&#39;re honest questions. Most parents don&#39;t think. They<br/>
fear. And they reach for answers that will soothe their fears. We ask<br/>
people to think! :-) And ask people to try it.<br/>
<br/>
What *will* happen if you make 5 dozen cookies every day for the next<br/>
5 weeks? Why would parents be afraid to try it? What do they fear<br/>
would happen? (No one needs to answer that here. It&#39;s just something<br/>
to ponder why it would seem a better idea to ask strangers than to<br/>
really think about something and try it out. It&#39;s just pure fear that<br/>
makes us imagine that opening the flood gate of cookies will make<br/>
kids never want to stop stuffing them.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m betting you can&#39;t even make it 2 days before the kids say &quot;STOP!<br/>
Let me have something besides these darn cookies!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t trust them,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it is that you don&#39;t trust them! Clear thinking is helped<br/>
*hugely* by honesty. Parents are trained to say things in a nice way,<br/>
to cover up the truth. And it really muddies thought.<br/>
<br/>
How many parents have said &quot;I asked nicely and he still didn&#39;t do<br/>
it.&quot; Well if you *asked* then one acceptable answer was no. If no<br/>
wasn&#39;t an acceptable answer, then it was a demand in a frilly dress.<br/>
<br/>
Take off the frilly dress and let those thoughts run naked. It&#39;s lots<br/>
easier to see what they really look like without their costumes on.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; but that if they&#39;re anything like me, then cookies it is, for <br/>
breakfast, lunch, and supper (and I DO eat them at every meal at this <br/>
point....)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And you don&#39;t trust yourself either.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m betting you can&#39;t make it through 2 days of nothing but cookies<br/>
either!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; So help me - should I stop?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What do you think? &lt;eg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Try it. See what happens.<br/>
<br/>
Also read Sandra&#39;s and my site and the archives. Because if our kids<br/>
*are* eating nothing but cookies, you shouldn&#39;t be asking us for<br/>
advice! ;-)<br/>

Sandra also has some unschooling blogs listed:<br/>

Ren is also running a Blog Carnival over at Familyrun (Radical<br/>
Unschoolers&#39; Network) where people write blog posts on a particular<br/>
topic and links to their posts are collected in once place:<br/>

<br/>
That should be a good source of what kids look like in unschooling<br/>
families.<br/>

OMG, Joyce, that&#39;s hilarious! The mental image...&lt;snort&gt;. <br/>
<br/>
So much of my own deschooling process was about letting all those <br/>
thoughts of mine run naked so I could really think critically about my <br/>
own preconceived notions. I had a Lot more than I thought I did! Whew.<br/>
