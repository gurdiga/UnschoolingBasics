sympathy and hindsight that now that he is 14 he rolls<br/>

Letting him have his own player is an idea if you are<br/>
desperate, just watch the volume on the headphones. Or<br/>
see if you can get him to agree to take turns with his<br/>
siblings, at least you&#39;d get a break.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-880165096">For us it was Jimi Hendrix&#39;s &quot;Burning of the Midnight Lamp&quot; when Liam <br/>
was 3 until he was about 5.  He would listen to that tune ALL day <br/>
long.  He learned (by himself) what that little button the CD player <br/>
meant with the two arrows, and then he could listen to the song over <br/>
and over and over and over and over and...   well, you get the <br/>
picture.  He also liked the  Jaco Pastorius composition &quot;A Remark You <br/>
Made,&quot; and he listened to that all the live-long day.  When he, I <br/>
mean we, wasn&#39;t listening to it, he was singing the songs, even <br/>
though the Pastorius comp was an instrumental.  He also really got <br/>
into Aaron Copeland&#39;s Appalachian Spring for a little while.  That was cool.<br/>
<br/>
It was a blessing that we liked the music he liked very much, but I <br/>
mean we heard it ALL the time.<br/>
<br/>
All. The. Time.<br/>
<br/>
No CD player in the car, though, so that was pretty cool.<br/>
<br/>
I just figured it was what he needed to do, so I would either try to <br/>
tune it out in a meditative sort of way or I would try to find some <br/>
other aspect to get into, maybe just listen to the bass line or <br/>
really focus on the drums or something like that.  I never asked him <br/>
not to listen to it or to listen to something else, but it was just <br/>
me and him during the day and his dad when he was home.  We just <br/>
allowed it, figuring it was obviously really important to Liam.  We <br/>
figured that when his need was met, he would move on, and he did.  I <br/>
also knew that the more I was able to *not resist* (sorry for the <br/>
split infinitive), the more likely Liam would be able to move on for <br/>
his own reasons, rather than for reasons of resisting my <br/>
resistance.  Know what I mean?  That was kind of our MO for <br/>
everything when he was little, in fact.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, that&#39;s easy for *me* to say, since there were no other <br/>
kids to accommodate.  I understand that your son doesn&#39;t like the <br/>
feeling of headphones, but how about the other kids?  Would *they* be <br/>
okay with listening to their own iPods or CDs?<br/>
<br/>
Just some thoughts.  I hope it&#39;s helpful!!<br/>

 Parents have needs and rights, too -- and a 5 yr old is old enough to<br/>
be able to understand that.  Perhaps if you present it to him as a<br/>
problem that you want his help solving, acknowledge that the<br/>
headphones/earbuds feel funny to him (and sometimes it is more the<br/>
oddness than discomfort), and ask him to help come up with solutions.<br/>
 You don&#39;t mind him listening to his music as much as he wants -- but<br/>
you have a need for a break from it part of the time in the car.  He<br/>
may be able to come up with a solution you haven&#39;t thought of, or be<br/>
more willing to compromise somewhere, if he realizes how it impacts<br/>
you.  (And, at 5, he probably doesn&#39;t, unless you tell him.)<br/>

Best of luck.<br/>

Since he can&#39;t handle the headphones, how about cd players for everyone else <br/>
and he can listen to the Ramones through the car?  Even though my kids are <br/>
much older, when we go on long trips, I listen to books on tape and have my <br/>
cassette or cd player with me. The kids have their Ipods.  We usually start <br/>
off our road trips listening to a variety of stations/cds through the car <br/>
stereo so we can all sing along :) and &#39;bond&#39;, but after a while, we can <br/>
have &#39;private time&#39; with our own music/book.  Even running errands around <br/>
town, we still do this.<br/>
<br/>
PS- Since I am usually driving, for safety&#39;s sake, and definitely when the <br/>
kids were younger, I needed to keep an &#39;ear&#39; on what was going on, I only <br/>
use one of the earplugs while I listen to my book.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with the two-way street concept in theory.  I don&#39;t agree, <br/>
however, that 5 ~ or any age ~ is &quot;old enough&quot; for anything.  That&#39;s <br/>
an arbitrary &quot;should,&quot; and I really think it&#39;s an individual <br/>
thing.  In mainstream society, I suppose 5-year-olds are expected to <br/>
do lots of things they may not be ready for.  But, if a family wishes <br/>
to eschew mainstream-thinking, these kinds of expectations have no place.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that it is best for the one who has more coping tools to be <br/>
the one who yields.  Only Karen know how well her Julian would be <br/>
equipped to do this now.  I like the idea of inviting him to offer <br/>
solutions, but when Karen wrote, &quot;Screaming. Tears. Anger...from <br/>
Julian that is,&quot; this suggested to me that he has a need that is <br/>
greater than his ability to be empathic to others ~ right now.<br/>
<br/>
It won&#39;t last forever.  Really.<br/>
<br/>
It would be most helpful to change how Julian&#39;s &quot;demands&quot; are <br/>
perceived.  He is adept at identifying what he needs and expressing <br/>
it.  That&#39;s amazing and wonderful!  There will be opportunities when <br/>
he develops more empathy to help him mesh his needs with others&#39; <br/>
needs around him.  He&#39;ll develop empathy by having it modeled for <br/>
him, and this gives you a beautiful opportunity to do that!  But, <br/>
this may not be the time to force him to develop empathy (an <br/>
oxymoron).  Forcing him cannot bring him any closer to achieving that skill.<br/>
<br/>
I think if you can find ways to help the other kids while meeting <br/>
Julian&#39;s needs, that will be wonderful!!  Just remember:  It won&#39;t <br/>
last forever.  Really.<br/>

LOL! I&#39;m just feeling better knowing I really am NOT alone. If I could  <br/>
afford iPods or even Walkmen, lol, for EACH child, I would! But I can&#39;t even  <br/>
afford a blank cd these days. I&#39;m trying to get the others in the car to accept  <br/>
it, I know it&#39;s a stage of sorts and will pass more easily on its own, than if  <br/>
we fight it. But it&#39;s just so much Ramones! lol! Hopefully this will  <br/>
pass...Float On by Modest Mouse and Hey Ya by Outkast, lol! Well, both of  those were <br/>
played a LOT too but it was different then - it was when he was  2...now he <br/>
SCREAMS at us when we take the cd out and it&#39;s like a security  blanket for <br/>
him...which means, I suppose, we just deal for now and hope it ends  soon, huh? At <br/>
least it&#39;s not too often that we are ALL in the car at the same  time, but I <br/>
DO miss hearing new music here and  there...lol...<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, I try. I have DEF. talked with him about taking turns, different  music <br/>
and bands, how others grow tired of the same music that often, all kinds  of <br/>
options. He is on the edge of SPD, so headphones or ear buds being  <br/>
uncomfortable are typical for him (many textures and feelings are too much for  him). <br/>

Nope, he had no suggestions. I&#39;m still aiming for taking turns with him and  <br/>
that kind of thing and being SUPER patient and think as best I can from a  <br/>

Since he can&#39;t handle the headphones, how about cd players for  everyone else <br/>
and he can listen to the Ramones through the car?  Even  though my kids are <br/>
much older, when we go on long trips, I listen to books  on tape and have my <br/>
cassette or cd player with me. The kids have their  Ipods.  We usually start <br/>
off our road trips listening to a variety of  stations/cds through the car <br/>
stereo so we can all sing along :) and  &#39;bond&#39;, but after a while, we can <br/>
have &#39;private time&#39; with our own  music/book.  Even running errands around <br/>
town, we still do  this.<br/>
<br/>
PS- Since I am usually driving, for safety&#39;s sake, and definitely  when the <br/>
kids were younger, I needed to keep an &#39;ear&#39; on what was going  on, I only <br/>
use one of the earplugs while I listen to my  book.<br/>
<br/>
G<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s an excellent idea, though we also all talk a lot in the car, so it&#39;s  <br/>
not all that conducive to family discussions, lol...also, the $$ for everyone  <br/>
with a portable cd player is not happening any time soon...so...patience, and  <br/>
heaps of it! :) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1614230724">Ok, the whole Ramones thread has me really thinking. When Caleb was that <br/>
age he went through the same thing of course, I think most kids do at <br/>
some time, but Caleb seemed to go through it for about 6 years straight. <br/>
He has always loved music from the time he was an infant, and there were <br/>
times when I could scream if I heard Allstar by Smashmouth ONE MORE <br/>
TIME! However, I knew he would eventually move on to something else, or <br/>
get a more widely varied taste in music. It happened in all due course, <br/>
but I think Caleb has a major issues with hyperfocusing in all aspects <br/>
of his life. This has made me wonder what may happen once he does get <br/>
out of PS and move into a unschooled environment.<br/>
<br/>
If given his complete druthers over what to do during the day, it would <br/>
most definitely be playing video or computer games. At what age do you <br/>
try to prevent (if any) hyperfocusing on one thing? It kind of muddies <br/>
the waters a bit when the thing Caleb really wants to do with the rest <br/>
of his life is become a computer game programmer. It&#39;s all he wants to <br/>
do really. How do I go about helping him to balance computer/video game <br/>
playing time with learning time, and in this case is there a major <br/>
difference?<br/>
<br/>
I kind of feel a bit hypocritical about this issue in a way, because due <br/>
to the manic depression, I tend to hyperfocus on things as well. When I <br/>
get the need to create, often times it becomes the only thing that is <br/>
important at the time. Dishwashing, laundry, or other non-essentials ;) <br/>
in life go out the window and I feel driven to see my idea come to <br/>
fruition.  I know how getting hyperfocused can drain you of all other <br/>
needs, like eating, sleeping and going to the bathroom, and Caleb does <br/>
the same things when he gets interested in something. I will catch him <br/>
at 3 AM playing his gameboy under the covers, or at his computer. He has <br/>
even wet himself because he put off going to the bathroom during an <br/>
exiciting video game.<br/>
<br/>
Would I be a complete hypocrite to not allow him to get some game out of <br/>
his system (like Julian and the Ramones) or is he old enough at 11/12 to <br/>
realize that there are other things in life? I know that eventually he <br/>
will get past that difficult level on that particular game, and will <br/>
then again be interested in doing other things, but until then even <br/>
things that he normally enjoys become burdens if it keeps him away from <br/>
the game, like say, eating supper, or going out hiking at the park. I <br/>
hate to say, it&#39;s ok for me because it is productive, but it&#39;s not for <br/>
Caleb because you don&#39;t get anything out of playing a video game. If <br/>
that is what he truly wants to do with his life, is that leisure time or <br/>
learning time?<br/>
<br/>
Just a bit confused at how I should approach this with an older child.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

My gut feeling, is that he needs what he does now because he needs to  <br/>
deschool, decompress. It&#39;s still a commodity in a sense, even with your  wonderful <br/>
relaxing-on - it way, he is still in school, and crossing in and out  can be <br/>
hard on a kid, especially prepubescent ones. I think if you continue to  offer <br/>
and show by doing other things in life, he&#39;ll get there in his time. And I  <br/>
think he IS getting things out of his video games, just not things that you are  <br/>
able to recognize. In time, you might, but if not, you can continue to respect <br/>
 that he has a passion of it. He may become a writer and creator of new video <br/>
 games ;) Ya never know... ;) Also, to help you ease into this, perhaps you <br/>
can  show him other things within the context of his loves...say, a video game <br/>
about  a subject that interests you...you can play it, with him, w/o him, and <br/>
it might  open up a door for him. It&#39;s hard, and I just recently got myself <br/>
over that  hurdle with specifically computer and video games. It took a lot of <br/>
mellowing on  my part. But it&#39;s been worth it, toatll...<br/>
 <br/>
I mean, hey now, you&#39;re an all star, get your game on, go play! ;) <br/>

<h4>Julie</h4>
<p><small><time>17 Sep 2007, at  6:36pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1008223734">Well that&#39;s what I am trying to get my head around. To tell you the <br/>
truth, I have in the past tried to limit his video game time to keep him <br/>
from getting so obsessed over them. It&#39;s just since joining this and <br/>
other unschooling lists that it has hit me that maybe doing that is <br/>
entirely wrong.<br/>
<br/>
I remember a time when I was in my early teens when I ended up staying <br/>
up all night long trying to teach myself how to draw horses. It was a <br/>
school night, and when my mother found out I had been up all night, she <br/>
was rather miffed at me. I tried to explain that I could catch up on the <br/>
sleep that I had lost, but had learned something important in the <br/>
process (how to draw horses).<br/>
<br/>
For the first time I am realizing that video gaming is what is truly <br/>
important to my son. I&#39;m having difficulty getting around all the <br/>
psychology experts saying it is an addiction, and harmful to kids...yada <br/>
yada yada. I wanted to be an artist when I grew up, art was important to <br/>
me, sleep wasn&#39;t. To my son, he was to program video games, so <br/>
therefore, learning to play video games well is important to him. <br/>
However, if it is something unhealthy (not eating, not using the <br/>
bathroom, not sleeping at all etc.) is there a point where it needs to <br/>
be limited, or would it be better to try and introduce him to some <br/>
programing software/classes/what have you to let him put that energy <br/>
into the &quot;making&quot; rather than only &quot;Playing&quot; videos games?<br/>
<br/>
I think I am confusing myself here so I know I am probably confusing <br/>
everyone else as well. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s use Julian&#39;s obsession with the Ramones as an example for a <br/>
moment. Is it bad for him to want to listen to the same thing over and <br/>
over and over again? No. What if he insisted in listening to it at full <br/>
volume with headphones on? That could be unhealthy to the ears right? <br/>
Cause permanent hearing loss etc. Somewhere, an obsession can become <br/>
unhealthy. If I just said Caleb, if it is important to you to play games <br/>
three days in a row with no sleep or food, go for it, would I be <br/>
allowing it to go too far? He has that ability to hyperfocus just that <br/>
much. Would it be wrong at his age to put limits on time spent playing <br/>
video games for his own protection, or would that be squashing his <br/>
interests?<br/>
<br/>
I guess you&#39;d have to be around a kid who has the capability of manic <br/>
episodes to understand. I know that sleep is important or can cause a <br/>
major crash later on. It can cause a complete lack of need for sleep, <br/>
food, or basic necessities. Completely unmedicated and on a manic high, <br/>
I can literally go days without food or sleep with little to no obvious <br/>
problems, but I pay for it afterwards with a major depression. The <br/>
higher you go, the harder you fall is pretty apt here. The same holds <br/>
true for Caleb as well.<br/>
<br/>
I just never really thought about allowing him to play games until he <br/>
got over them before until I started reading this thread about Julian <br/>
and the Ramones. It made me think back to my own past experiences and <br/>
about the analogy of learning to Draw horses and how I was proud of what <br/>
I had accomplished, yet my mother was upset at me for not sleeping. It <br/>
made me take a step back and wonder if I am doing the same thing, even <br/>
unconsciously to Caleb, or if there should be some kind of dividing line <br/>
where I can tell him maybe we should put the games away for a while.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1688940650">OMG! All those years of listening to that song over and over again and I <br/>
never knew what that line said! lol No wonder he is a hard core gamer! <br/>
Thanks for that insight!<br/>
<br/>
Actually that is exactly what he wants to do when he gets older, program <br/>
games, so that is what made me stop and wonder if putting limits on him <br/>
(that and the Ramones thread) made me stop and link it to my own <br/>
experiences growing up, wanting to be an artist.<br/>
<br/>
I know that I have to be careful around video games myself. If I get <br/>
into one, I can&#39;t stop playing until I beat the game or just burn myself <br/>
out on it. Of course to me it has always been kind of mindless <br/>
entertainment, because it is not my chief love in life. But it just <br/>
dawned on me that this IS HIS chief love and inspiration in life along <br/>
with what he wants to do creatively.<br/>
<br/>
I really appreciate this list for making me take a step back and <br/>
reassessing my views about it and looking at it outside the box so to speak.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; My gut feeling, is that he needs what he does now because he needs to  <br/>
&gt; deschool, decompress. It&#39;s still a commodity in a sense, even with your  wonderful <br/>
&gt; relaxing-on - it way, he is still in school, and crossing in and out  can be <br/>
&gt; hard on a kid, especially prepubescent ones. I think if you continue to  offer <br/>
&gt; and show by doing other things in life, he&#39;ll get there in his time. And I  <br/>
&gt; think he IS getting things out of his video games, just not things that you are  <br/>
&gt; able to recognize. In time, you might, but if not, you can continue to respect <br/>
&gt;  that he has a passion of it. He may become a writer and creator of new video <br/>
&gt;  games ;) Ya never know... ;) Also, to help you ease into this, perhaps you <br/>
&gt; can  show him other things within the context of his loves...say, a video game <br/>
&gt; about  a subject that interests you...you can play it, with him, w/o him, and <br/>
&gt; it might  open up a door for him. It&#39;s hard, and I just recently got myself <br/>
&gt; over that  hurdle with specifically computer and video games. It took a lot of <br/>
&gt; mellowing on  my part. But it&#39;s been worth it, toatll...<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I mean, hey now, you&#39;re an all star, get your game on, go play! ;) <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi, Julie!  I can&#39;t tell for sure if you&#39;re tongue was in your cheek <br/>
when you wrote this, but if not, don&#39;t give the song that much <br/>
credit.  Your son is who he is.  (If you were tongue-in-cheek, <br/>
though, please ignore the above!!)  :-)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Cool!  I have found it to be really helpful to remind myself <br/>
periodically that my son is NOT me.  We have a lot in common, it&#39;s <br/>
true, but he is his own person and does many things differently than <br/>
I do and for different reasons.  I remind myself that I am holding a <br/>
space for Liam to become the best *Liam* he can be, *not* the best <br/>
Marji (I&#39;ve already got dibs on being the best Marji!!).  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
It has also been helpful for me to remember that unschooling is all <br/>
about trust and providing my son with what he needs.  Sometimes I <br/>
have to divine what he needs, but most of the time, he just tells <br/>
me.  This path is Liam&#39;s path, and I see my role here as helping him <br/>
be on it.  Whatever he needs, I do my best to get for him.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I trust that Liam trusts me.  So, if, to use your example, <br/>
there&#39;s a danger of him overdriving his ear buds and damaging his <br/>
hearing by playing the music too loudly, I very gently and politely <br/>
tug his coat (as I would anyone who I thought needed the information) <br/>
and inform him of the dangers.  He understands that I trust him <br/>
enough to understand me and my intentions and he is always <br/>
appreciative for the helpful information.  I give him the information <br/>
he needs and trust that he will act on it as he sees fit.  In some <br/>
areas, he needs to learn for himself.  I totally respect <br/>
that!  Sometimes, I&#39;m ::gasp:: wrong!!<br/>
<br/>
If it were me, I would do my best to try to shift away from seeing <br/>
him as &quot;hyperfocusing.&quot;  I&#39;d do my best to support him (by bringing <br/>
him food to eat if I think he&#39;s been going without for too long or <br/>
gently reminding him that he may want to pause and use the <br/>
bathroom).  I&#39;d do my best to make sure he has all the tools he needs <br/>
to fully immerse himself in his passion.  I&#39;d be his partner in the immersion.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this is helpful!<br/>
