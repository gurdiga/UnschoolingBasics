<div id="ygrps-yiv-700247343">My DH has gotten a job offer in LA (state).  I have looked up  there laws on <br/>
HSLDA.com, but was wondering if anyone who lived there could tell  me what it <br/>
is like to unschool in LA?  Is there any  requirments?<br/>

&quot; Work like you don&#39;t need the money, love like you&#39;ve  never been hurt, and <br/>
dance like you do when nobody&#39;s watching.&quot;<br/>

&quot;All that  is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good people  do<br/>
nothing.&quot;<br/>

&quot; Knowledge is power but how you use that power defines  wether you are good <br/>
or evil.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1738110789">I do not live in LA, but I have a friend who does and who homeschools there. <br/>
She has always told me it is absolutely wonderful after homeschooling in NY <br/>
for two years.  She sends a letter to the Department of Education every fall <br/>
and that is it.  No other reporting, no record keeping, no testing, no <br/>
interference.  She regularly taunts me about this, as I&#39;m still in NY, home <br/>
of heavy regulation (although we work around it just fine).<br/>
<br/>
There is a LA unschooling yahoo group - <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LAUnschoolers/.">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LAUnschoolers/.</a>  I&#39;m sure you could get a <br/>
first hand answer there.<br/>

Louisiana has 2 options - homestudy and private school.<br/>
<br/>
Homestudy is using curriculum at home and private school is <br/>
establishing your own &#39;school&#39;.  I personally do the private school <br/>
option.  It requires an annual letter to the state, but nothing else.  <br/>
And you don&#39;t have to &#39;register&#39; till age 7.  <br/>
<br/>
Here is a good site:<br/>

Feel free to write off list if you want to discuss.<br/>

Blessings,<br/>
