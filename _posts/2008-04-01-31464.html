<div id="ygrps-yiv-512729496">Kelly, I was looking through some things you&#39;ve written about unschooling,<br/>
and I found this:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine being stressed while unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
I think the only thing that would be stressful is actually &quot;getting it&quot; and<br/>
replying to grandparents or neighbors---but I&#39;m waaaay past that as well. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I get overwhelmed by too much on my plate, but usually I&#39;m having<br/>
too much fun to drop something. I just need to stop and focus and regroup a<br/>
bit. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never heard of burn-out from unschooling. Anyone else?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;m stressed though. And the stress comes from having an autistic<br/>
child (4) who yells at his sister (8) all day long and fights with his<br/>
brother (2). Also - I am a personality who needs a relative amount of space<br/>
and quiet to myself.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Do you think there are some personalities of parents who suit unschooling<br/>
more than others?<br/>
<br/>
How do you realistically take time out for peace and quiet?<br/>
<br/>
How can I give everyone what they need ? My daughter needs heaps of friends<br/>
and lots of attention from me. My autistic son needs peace, quiet and mummy<br/>
to give him the calming therapy he needs every day. My two year old son<br/>
needs breastfeeding and cuddles a LOT. My husband needs someone to talk to<br/>
about his stressful job and I need to &#39;achieve&#39; things in a quiet atmosphere<br/>
(ie. Knit a pair of socks) to feel worthwhile.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Help!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Cecily!  I relate to you as I too am one who needs space.  It&#39;s  <br/>
easier for me now as my kids are older but I do remember the day when  <br/>
the kids were little.  My husband would try to take the kids out from  <br/>
time to time for a day or give me a day out whichever I was needing.   <br/>
The problem was that I wouldn&#39;t get the time until I was so stressed  <br/>
and miserable.  We would talk about having scheduled time off so I  <br/>
could plan and look forward to it but we never made that happen.   <br/>
There was a time when I found a young lady .... early 20&#39;s who would  <br/>
come once or twice a week for a couple of hours and either help me  <br/>
around the house or take the kids out to the park or out to do  <br/>
something fun.  If she took them out for a treat or a movie I would  <br/>
pay for that ... but usually she took them to do something that  <br/>
didn&#39;t cost.  They loved their time with her.   We couldn&#39;t pay her  <br/>
much but we came up with an agreeable pay.  Even at once a week for  <br/>
only 2 hours I so looked forward to that time.<br/>
<br/>
This is what I know, Cecily, it is sooo important for you to take  <br/>
care of you and give yourself what you need.  Be creative ... think  <br/>
outside the box if you have to but figure something out.  Your cup  <br/>
needs to be filled so that you have something to give to others -  <br/>
even your family.  I&#39;ve talked to women so stressed out that they&#39;ve  <br/>
made themselves sick.  Getting sick is your body&#39;s way of saying  <br/>
enough!  For crazy busy women I&#39;ve been known to suggest what I call  <br/>
love activities.  Sounds weird, I know ... but giving to yourself is  <br/>
a way of expressing self love.  Find and make time in your day to  <br/>
give to you even if it&#39;s only 15 minutes maybe while the kids nap.   <br/>
In those 15 minutes do something that you love, that&#39;s  <br/>
destressing ... something that will help fill your cup.  You  <br/>
mentioned knitting.  I know 15 minutes isn&#39;t long but 15 minutes is  <br/>
better than 0 minutes.  And maybe you can do a couple of 15 minutes  <br/>
chunks of time throughout the day.  If not.. it&#39;s ok. It&#39;s a place to  <br/>
start.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this gives you some ideas or inspires some ideas of your own.<br/>

mine are 17, 20, and 23.<br/>
<br/>
Learn to take 1-minute mental vacations. Go into the bathroom, shut  <br/>
the door and your eyes, visualize yourself somewhere peaceful and  <br/>
quiet. Don&#39;t expect more than 60 seconds or you&#39;ll be frustrated and  <br/>
disappointed instead of calmed. These mini-vacations can make a  <br/>
gigantic difference.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Start with that last thing - you must recognize your worth as a mother  <br/>
and partner so that doing a good job in those roles gives you self- <br/>
satisfaction. Pay more attention and make mental notes when you  <br/>
&quot;achieve&quot; things like connecting with a child, supporting a child,  <br/>
etc. Satisfied, happy kids are a way better payoff than a pair of socks.<br/>
<br/>
Try to think of some of the nurturing you&#39;re doing as being for  <br/>
yourself, too. That&#39;ll help, Think of it as giving your kids what they  <br/>
need and, in so doing, getting to experience childhood again, with  <br/>
more abundance and sweetness than you did the first time (when you  <br/>
were the child).<br/>
<br/>
Try to set things up to coordinate different needs/interests. Have  <br/>
friends over to your house more than going out to others houses so  <br/>
that your daughter can play with other kids in her room or the back  <br/>
yard while you spend time in another, quieter, room with your son or  <br/>
at least he can be home in his familiar space and have a place to be  <br/>
in another room. Or go to a park and you spend time with your son  <br/>
while the others play. Maybe these particular ideas won&#39;t work - but  <br/>
the point is to plan ahead and develop habits that take each person&#39;s  <br/>
needs into account.<br/>
<br/>
And - breathe deep. Take each day and each moment as they come.<br/>

Isn&#39;t it funny?  I thought I would love unschooling because it would<br/>
de-stress my life!  I thought giving up all that added stress of<br/>
curriculums, expectations, etc. would make life calm and peaceful.  Don&#39;t<br/>
get me wrong, I did feel a huge weight lifted when I realized I could give<br/>
all that unnecessary stuff up, and just be with my family.    But it seems<br/>
like the old stress has been replaced with new stress (like the ones you&#39;ve<br/>
listed above!).  I don&#39;t know about you, but I am very new to unschooling,<br/>
so that probably has something to do with it.  (Hopefully!)<br/>

&gt; Yes. I think optimism is important. A pretty strong energy level  <br/>
&gt; helps. Patience is good.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What if you don&#39;t have a strong or high energy level? How important <br/>
is it to get out and do things vs. staying home and hanging out <br/>
together? I&#39;m tired a lot, physically and mentally. I&#39;m hoping it&#39;s <br/>
just because I have young children and as they get older and I get <br/>
more sleep my energy level will go up. I have noticed that on those <br/>
nights when my baby sleeps longer than usual I have a lot more <br/>
energy the next day. I vaguely remember those days when I had only <br/>
one 10 year old and I was almost always doing something. <br/>
<br/>
Another question for me is how important is it to get out and do <br/>
things when the children are still very young. I guess I don&#39;t think <br/>
it&#39;s so very important to get out a lot with my 4 year old whereas I <br/>
might find it moreso when he&#39;s 10. Sometimes I do worry, though, <br/>
that we don&#39;t get out enough. I try to take the kids for a walk <br/>
every day but it&#39;s just around the neighborhood in the stroller. My <br/>
4 year old plays with the 4yo boy next door most days now that the <br/>
weather is warmer and he has met the boys who live behind us who are <br/>
a bit older. We try to get to the park that&#39;s within walking <br/>
distance at least once a week. So, we&#39;re not total recluses and my <br/>
ds does get time to play with other kids but we don&#39;t have a lot of <br/>
variety. <br/>

expectations about getting me time. I have to consciously remind <br/>
myself that the time that my attention will be constantly demanded <br/>
is very short in the larger scheme of things. I can and still do <br/>
sometimes get very frustrated in the moment if I JUST WANT TO FINISH <br/>
THIS LAST ROW (I knit, too). I have to shift my thinking at that <br/>
moment and decide that it&#39;s not that important at that moment and <br/>
let it go. That&#39;s probably a bit different with an autistic child <br/>
but as your other children get older you won&#39;t have as many demands <br/>
on your time as you do now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1071064348">There is no point where you *shouldn&#39;t* unschool (actually, my first  <br/>
flip response was &#39;when you&#39;re dead&#39;).<br/>
<br/>
We came to unschooling while I was on bedrest, stuck on my left side  <br/>
for nearly six months. Before that we were doing school at home. It  <br/>
was very scary for me, dh was gone most of the time, and my kids were  <br/>
ten, eight, six, five, three and almost two. I didn&#39;t have TIME to be  <br/>
on bedrest, much less the &#39;energy&#39; to unschool. But being removed  <br/>
from the position of control is exactly what worked best for my kids  <br/>
(and me) For us really. That doesn&#39;t mean it will work best for you,  <br/>
but so much depends on YOUR outlook, whether you can be positive  <br/>
about it. I also have an autoimmune disorder, so I understand about  <br/>
having limited energy, and for our family that means that I have to  <br/>
choose a LOT, because when you&#39;re only alloted ten units of energy a  <br/>
day, you can&#39;t afford to waste it on housework or yardwork or  <br/>
unnecessary things. It will go to the kids.<br/>

I really do think it takes a pretty active and energetic type of  <br/>
person to unschool well. Bring the world to the kids and kids to the  <br/>
world and notice and support the things that interest them. Easy to  <br/>
say - takes a lot of mental attention and energy to do it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If your illness and lack of energy prevents you from providing a  <br/>
stimulating and rich environment or supporting your kids&#39; interests,  <br/>
then you&#39;ll have to decide whether another option would be better.<br/>
<br/>
But, I&#39;ve known a number of people who unschooled with long-term or  <br/>
chronic illnesses or other difficulties. What I&#39;ve noticed is that  <br/>
they had to have a significant degree of mental energy to adapt and  <br/>
make things happen for their kids when they couldn&#39;t do things  <br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
The point is that it DOES take work and effort and energy - a totally  <br/>
different kind than sending kids off to school every day - but  <br/>
definitely it is not a lesser degree. Depression, for example, makes  <br/>
unschooling less good for the kids - and part of that is lack of  <br/>
energy that comes with depression. It isn&#39;t fair to the kids to keep  <br/>
them out of school and then not offer them at the least the amount of  <br/>
the world that school would offer.<br/>

<br/>
I have mixed feelings about this. Early on in our unschooling journey,<br/>
I was very severely depressed. I felt like, even if we&#39;re not out<br/>
exploring as much as we ideally would, at least my child wasn&#39;t<br/>
getting the messages that he did when he went to school: he shouldn&#39;t<br/>
be so sensitive, he should be more social, he should be more<br/>
competitive. The message that he wasn&#39;t OK being who he is. Along with<br/>
all the other BS that goes with school - very little outside time,<br/>
every moment controlled, not being able to complete things you really<br/>
wanted to, etc. I believed our *less* enriched environment was still a<br/>
healthier place to be. I had read on an unschooling list two people<br/>
that shouldn&#39;t unschool were single parents and depressed people. At<br/>
one point, I was a single, depressed mom, and I still believed our<br/>
home was a healthier place to be than school. I realized someone&#39;s<br/>
opinion on a list wouldn&#39;t dictate my reality. (and believe me, I was<br/>
questioning my choice!) My kids definitely didn&#39;t want to go to school<br/>
- and I spoke honestly with them about it, I didn&#39;t make school out to<br/>
be nightmarish or anything. But they saw their schooled friends with<br/>
homework, etc. and knew they&#39;d rather be home - especially my oldest,<br/>
who had gone to 1st and 2nd grades at a charter school.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s years later, and I&#39;m still very glad they didn&#39;t go to school, as<br/>
are they.<br/>

until your children reach school age? What is that anyway, 7 years <br/>
old? It seems to start sooner and sooner every year. Now &quot;they&quot; are <br/>
talking about making 3 year old preschool free and accessible to <br/>
everyone. I think I heard Hillary Clinton talking about or read on her <br/>
campaign website that she&#39;s actively involved in getting this done.<br/>
<br/>
I think I had a lot of energy, physically and mentally, before I had <br/>
my 2nd child. Then I lost it. When he reached 2 I spontaneously came <br/>
out of some sort of fog. It was really strange. I hadn&#39;t realized <br/>
until I came out of it just how bogged down in it I was. I had very <br/>
little energy or motivation to do anything. I laugh and tell people it <br/>
took me 2 years to recover from pregnancy and birth with him.<br/>
<br/>
I do find myself having more energy sooner with this 3rd baby than <br/>
with my 2nd but I don&#39;t feel 100%, either. That makes me worry that my <br/>
2nd child, who is 4 years old, is missing out on a lot because I&#39;m <br/>
just too tired. I don&#39;t plan much or get involved in much because I <br/>
never know from one day to the next if I&#39;m going to feel up to doing <br/>
something. I do want to do more, though, some day.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well - I would NEVER say single parents shouldn&#39;t unschool - clearly  <br/>
some of the most wonderful unschooling families I know are those with  <br/>
single parents.<br/>
<br/>
That may have been a misinterpretation of something else - it is  <br/>
difficult for DIVORCED parents to unschool when the ex isn&#39;t totally  <br/>
on board with it. When people are considering a divorce, that is  <br/>
something they have to consider seriously - it could make unschooling  <br/>
impossible.<br/>
<br/>
As far as depression - if someone is keeping their kids out of school  <br/>
but is not coping, themselves, with life well enough to support the  <br/>
kids&#39; interests, not able to offer them a stimulating enriched  <br/>
environment, then unschooling is not going to go all that well.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, you might keep them from some negative school-related stuff. But  <br/>
it is possible for school to be better than home, if home is sad,  <br/>
boring, draining, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - low-energy levels - meaning parents not able to support a  <br/>
reasonably sparkly interesting lifestyle - are a negative when it  <br/>
comes to unschooling. If someone asks what characteristics in the  <br/>
parent help unschooling go well - I still say having a high energy  <br/>
level and positive outlook on life are very important.<br/>

you&#39;ll find you&#39;ve moved to far one way or the other and you&#39;ll  <br/>
adjust. The kids will change - often just when you feel equilibrium  <br/>

<br/>
It can help a lot of you have a couple of friends over to your house  <br/>
for your social kid, very often. Try to set something up that is  <br/>
regular and she can count on it. So she&#39;s getting social time while  <br/>
your son stays in his comfort zone. Takes work on your part to get  <br/>
that set up - to juggle social stuff, but if you invite people to your  <br/>
house often, that is less stressful than going out a lot.<br/>

Well, unschooling doesn&#39;t insulate us against life&#39;s ups and downs,<br/>
that&#39;s for sure! But it helps us navigate with more grace.<br/>
<br/>
I think the further we go, the more we are able to realize that many<br/>
things have nothing to do with the unschooling, its just LIFE issues.<br/>
Families have different dynamics and personalitites all of which can<br/>
create different kinds of chaos.:)<br/>
How we handle the chaotic moments get better and better....hopefully.<br/>
But stuff happens. Life isn&#39;t perfect but unschooling sure helps makes<br/>
it awesome!<br/>

are, to be honest.<br/>
It isn&#39;t something I do to the kids. I would be unlikely to say: &quot;I  <br/>
unschool Rosie.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But, sure, think in terms of the principles of unschooling - apply  <br/>
them to infants, too. Bring the world to the child and the child to  <br/>
the world and support their interests. For an infant, that means one  <br/>
thing, for a 17-year-old, that means something very different.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is sort of unnecessary to say &quot;We are unschoolers&quot; when  <br/>
school isn&#39;t required anyway. To me, it is good parenting. In the  <br/>
absence of required school, none of us would be &quot;unschooling,&quot; we&#39;d be  <br/>
living a glorious life. I only use the term &quot;unschooling&quot; when talking  <br/>

really good. You don&#39;t have to be going out of the house a lot - but  <br/>
you can make lots of &quot;stuff&quot; available. Put a sheet of construction  <br/>
paper in a cookie tray and dump in a little paint and a marble - let  <br/>
him/her roll it around and make designs. Make homemade playdough and  <br/>
put weird stuff in it to change the smell and texture - like pineapple  <br/>
extract and oatmeal or rice. Give them lots of old spice jars and they  <br/>
can make potions. Mix cornstarch and water and play with that in the  <br/>
tub. Put a paper towel over the top of a glass with a rubber band  <br/>
around it - slowly add pennies on top of the papertowel until it caves  <br/>
in (count the pennies - try to get more next time). Put a sweet potato  <br/>
in water and watch it grown into a cool vine. And so on -- just  <br/>
regular stuff around the house. Bath play with kitchen utensils and  <br/>
bubbles is fun. Pick up cotton balls with chopsticks.<br/>

depressive and low energy moments.  (Chemo is no picnic!)  Not just <br/>
moments; often weeks or months.  I&#39;m in a lot of pain now, and <br/>
definitely low energy.  But the joy of being with my kids is what <br/>
gets me through it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ok. This is how I look at things, too. I&#39;m involved in unschooling <br/>
groups because they are the closest I have found to my parenting <br/>
philosophy. I don&#39;t really think of it in terms of doing or not <br/>
doing school. It&#39;s just the way we live. I do have to catch myself <br/>
sometimes, though, when I start thinking too much in terms of school <br/>
stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure I am still in a bit of a fog. My baby is not sleeping <br/>
through the night. Most nights I&#39;m lucky if I get 5 hours of sleep <br/>
and it&#39;s never more than 2 consecutive hours. I know I&#39;m feeling <br/>
better this time than last time, though, because I&#39;m more motivated <br/>
to exercise.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a bit frustrated right now because there is a lot that I want to <br/>
do but I don&#39;t feel up to it yet. I imagine that in a few months <br/>
we&#39;ll be doing more and a few months from that we&#39;ll be doing even <br/>
more.<br/>
