<div id="ygrps-yiv-1761807702">Jann,  thanks for the welcome!  We live in MN.  I have *tried* to<br/>
check out Anne&#39;s group and I do belong to it, but I just can&#39;t keep up<br/>
with all the posts.  There is so much I want to read and not enough<br/>
time (I&#39;m a slow reader on top of it), and I&#39;m easily overwhelmed, so<br/>
I just stick around here ;)  (((hugs))) on all you&#39;re going through.   <br/>
<br/>
Ren,  I was so happy to hear my &quot;review&quot; made your day.  The break out<br/>
session that you and Sandra led for &quot;Mindful Parenting&quot; had the<br/>
biggest impact on my dh. So if you can explain my radical &quot;crunchy&quot; <br/>
idea to &quot;Mr. Logical&quot; (who needs &quot;scientific proof&quot;), that&#39;s saying A<br/>
LOT! :)<br/>
<br/>
Now you made my day when you said that I was being mindful and<br/>
respectful!  I know that I have a long way to go, but it&#39;s good to<br/>
know that I&#39;m moving in the right direction.  I really need to work on<br/>
being more &quot;present&quot; with the kids and trying to make transitions<br/>
easier.  I tend to &quot;hide&quot; from the kids when  I&#39;m overwhelmed and of<br/>
course it&#39;s just a vicious cycle.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Solve issues without blame, without name calling. When it happens I<br/>
say &quot;that isn&#39;t a<br/>
helpful way to solve this problem, let&#39;s focus on how everyone can get<br/>
what they need right now&quot; Ah that&#39;s awesome!  I&#39;m going to paste that<br/>
around my house to help me remember that!   I just use that and it<br/>
worked!!! And it was with the 2 kids that fight the most!<br/>
<br/>
Danielle, that&#39;s a really good point about putting all my energy into<br/>
making it as easy as possible for him when he does get carted along<br/>
and doing it without resentment (that&#39;s a tough one).  We have turned<br/>
down things that I know that he would just be miserable at,  and the<br/>
other kids know that we can&#39;t do it because of Nate, but he doesn&#39;t. I<br/>
had thought about seeing if he was ready to play some board games to<br/>
get the idea of taking turns. It&#39;s the girls&#39; turn to go swimming,<br/>
it&#39;s your turn to stay home and ride your bike.<br/>
<br/>
I need to make a trip to the $ store!<br/>
<br/>
Pam, I was LMBO when you said you just happened to have chop sticks<br/>
and cotton balls in your van! Now I&#39;m going to have to find some<br/>
because that sounds fun.  I really need to remember how important it<br/>
is to &quot;keep the focus on the kids&quot;.  Your post  about having very<br/>
little time to write a speech and still making time for your dd when<br/>
she called, and she knew that you would make time for her no matter<br/>
what, that has really stayed with me.  I want that for myself and my<br/>
kids.  I want them to know that they are the most important but I<br/>
haven&#39;t done a good job of showing it *yet*!!! <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so grateful to finding out about unschooling and mindful parenting<br/>
( I wish I would have found it 10 years earlier though!) and for<br/>
having someone to show that there are other options.  I&#39;ve heard that<br/>
if Nate &quot;spent a day at their house&quot;  he would be happy to have a mom<br/>
like me.  That he would behave better if I was stricter with him. It&#39;s<br/>
really hard to find the middle ground between being permissive or a<br/>
martyr and authoritarian and disrespectful and I finding myself going<br/>
back and forth out of frustration. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;But sometimes they really can&#39;t and if the mom could only see it from<br/>
a different vantage point, I think she&#39;d see that the time spent NOW<br/>
with the needy child will do more to create peace in her family then<br/>
the benefit mom will get from the adult interaction.&quot;  Another one I<br/>
have to paste up to remind me!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2098808157">HI Crissy!!! I was almost sure it was you!!<br/>
Its Alex...we met last winter at Peapsquick( SP???)<br/>
I am sorry we lost touch. Its been a crazy year. I was preggo when I met you and I lost that baby at almost 14 weeks. Well I am due again February 4th.<br/>
I did meet Josefina we have been close friends with her and her son but they just moved up to the cities.<br/>
I lurk here and I love it also. I probably check my e-mail 4 or 5 times a day just to read all the wonderful discussions here.<br/>
I also just got Rue&#39;s book and I read it in 2 days. It is great.<br/>
If you remember I have a son who will be 4 next June. He was always very &quot;high need&quot; and intense. He is wonderful!<br/>
I also trying to learn as much as possible about having more than one child. I want to be better. I get all the unschooling life and we have been unschoolers (even without knowing) from day one) but I make too many mistake. I catch myself saying horrible things and getting really frustrated at times..<br/>
Well I hope we can get together again sometime. <br/>
Great to &quot;see&quot; you.,<br/>
Alex<br/>
