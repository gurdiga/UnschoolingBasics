<div id="ygrps-yiv-53357668">My co-parent, Dan, and I just got back from a long weekend in<br/>
Portland, Oregon and have come home to a huge mess.  We left our<br/>
children in the care of my mother after many very long conversations<br/>
about respecting my children&#39;s routines and many other things.  My<br/>
mother assured me repeatedly that she was not going to do anything<br/>
that would disturb their lives.  The first night after we left I got a<br/>
frantic phone call from Emily (14) because my mother sat them down and<br/>
gave them this huge list of rules about what they could and couldn&#39;t<br/>
do and what she expected of them (very early bedtimes, no computers,<br/>
cell phones, video games, limited tv, food only that she gives them,<br/>
etc. etc. etc.)  Basically exactly opposite of what she assured me she<br/>
wouldn&#39;t do.  Emily was threatening to run away and was begging me to<br/>
let her go stay at the house by herself.   I just wasn&#39;t comfortable<br/>
yet with that, maybe next year or if we were in a different<br/>
neighborhood where the neighbors actually are concerned with what<br/>
happens with each other and know each other.  Fortunatly, I was able<br/>
to get Rose (a quiet member of our list who rarely posts and lives in<br/>
our same town) on the phone.  She agreed to go &quot;rescue&quot; Emily.  I<br/>
actually had to have Dan talk to her because I was crying so badly<br/>
with all the anger I had about my mother.  Of course my mother greatly<br/>
chastized me for &quot;interfering&quot; and that I didn&#39;t allow her to &quot;work<br/>
things through&quot; with Emily (interpretation for those of you that don&#39;t<br/>
translate my mother&#39;s verbiage - break her to do my will, but make her<br/>
think it was her idea).  There were several times this past weekend<br/>
where I felt like some failure of a parent because of things that my<br/>
mother said to me.  Of course I know none of it is true, but it is so<br/>
easy for me to go into that &quot;I&#39;m not worthy because my mother doesn&#39;t<br/>
approve&quot; stage.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my mother things I&#39;ve done wrong because I interfered and I<br/>
felt that I did right because my child asked me to help her and I did.<br/>
 My mom says that my interference has impacted our relationship and I<br/>
feel that my interference preserved the one that I have with my child<br/>
(who I do have to live with at least for four more years).  I&#39;m glad<br/>
that my younger two children are a bit more flexible, but at the<br/>
moment they are in glommed onto the tv, soaking in it all.  I&#39;m sure<br/>
it will be a while before they can trust again that their lives are<br/>
back to normal.  The sad thing is that my mother thinks she was so<br/>
good at watching the kids because they went to bed when she told them<br/>
to, stopped watching tv when she told them to and only ate what she<br/>
allowed them to.  :-(  And she wonders why we want to move nearly<br/>
3,000 miles away.<br/>
<br/>
I know that there is major damage that has been done with my<br/>
relationship with my mom.  I know now that I can never trust her again<br/>
to care for my children and Dan and I are making serious changes to<br/>
our will this week so that she won&#39;t be the primary care giver if<br/>
something were to happen to us.  I just feel so betrayed.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Michelle, Wow! That sounds horrible to experience while being so far<br/>
away from your children. I don&#39;t quite understand the purpose of the<br/>
trip and details of not being able to returning home. But I am glad<br/>
that you have gained so much awareness about your mother&#39;s needs for<br/>
control and desires to &quot;help&quot; in the manner that she sees fit,<br/>
regardless of your own (and children&#39;s?) boundaries. That information<br/>
will certainly allow you to understand her &quot;agreement&quot; in the future.<br/>
From your note, it sounds like your younger children were &quot;agreeable&quot;<br/>
to remain with grandma? And that they similarly felt empowered to call<br/>
for &quot;rescuing&quot;, IF they felt they desired it? These have been my<br/>
criteria for leaving ds with anyone: that he is loved by the<br/>
caregiver, that *he* has a recourse and ability to access me, that I<br/>
trust that his *will* about his needs will be honored, and that I will<br/>
return at the absolute first opportunity if he feels that he needs *me*.  <br/>
<br/>
I can certainly give you empathy for your experience of anger and<br/>
frustration. But, I am stuck wondering about the children continuing<br/>
with your mother after she was &quot;caught&quot; disregarding your wishes. My<br/>
inclination is to recognize your mother&#39;s underlying needs for<br/>
&quot;helping&quot; on her own terms in her own home; but the betrayal of your<br/>
agreement when you were vulnerable to alter the situation would have<br/>
had me at her door step on the next plane, regardless. As you<br/>
mentioned, your connection, trust and relationship with your children<br/>
is paramount. Even over the probable $1000+ last minute, one-way air<br/>
fare, imo. I don&#39;t want to be Monday-Morning-Quaterbacking here, but<br/>
want to empathize the huge damage control costs associated with this<br/>
situation. Do your children also feel a similar betrayal?<br/>
<br/>
Of course, &quot;children are resilient&quot; is a common self-supportive<br/>
mantra. But, I would examine the circumstances leading up to the<br/>
situation and determine ways that the feelings and needs of all<br/>
parties, including your mother, could have more accurately and<br/>
forthrightly been addressed. Apparently, your mother does not feel<br/>
that she can have her needs in her own home met, within the<br/>
constraints (actually freedoms), that your children desire. That is<br/>
either something to avoid, or something to discuss further. Knowing<br/>
perhaps, that this situation will NEVER happen again, it is easiest to<br/>
move on and just be glad for what you have learned, with as little<br/>
damage (or none) that occured, BECAUSE your children are empowered and<br/>
trust that their needs would be addressed by you all at any point that<br/>
they were voiced, even if grandma has some silly rules. <br/>
<br/>
I hope that you can find some perspective to understand your mom&#39;s<br/>
position of wanting something that was &quot;forbidden&quot;. It isn&#39;t unlike<br/>
children who are &quot;not allowed&quot;, they still desire what they want, even<br/>
if they have to sneak to have it. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Returning was just not an option.  You are right it would have been<br/>
$1,000 for the two of us to return at a moment&#39;s notice (which we<br/>
don&#39;t have and don&#39;t use credit cards - if we don&#39;t have it we don&#39;t<br/>
spend it) and with the difficulties we had in getting there due to<br/>
weather and full flights, getting home may have been unavailable at<br/>
the last minute.  And yes, my children do feel betrayed and my girls<br/>
could care less if they have anything to do with their grandmother<br/>
again.  Mary Elayne (11) we refer to as our &quot;future lawyer&quot; not<br/>
because she will be one, but because she argues like one.  She kept<br/>
quoting what my mother had agreed to and my mother kept doing that<br/>
&quot;Texas two-stepping dance&quot; around it.  My dad was no help as he just<br/>
kept saying, &quot;War&#39;s hell&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My mother is very angry that I chose to get invovled instead of using<br/>
her mantra of &quot;It will be interesting how you work this out.&quot; (I heard<br/>
that most of my life when I would go to her with problems.)  How dare<br/>
I rule over her head from 3,000 miles away!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I know that this will never happen again.  I&#39;ve actually been<br/>
amazed at how well we have slipped back into our old lives so easily.<br/>
I truly feared I would have a lot of repair work to do, but aside from<br/>
extra cuddles and hugs (which I did expect having been away for 5<br/>
days) today isn&#39;t much different from last week before I left.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My mom has never approved of the way I parent.  When I was pregnant<br/>
and went to midwives instead of OB&#39;s for prenatal care (although I did<br/>
have c/s&#39;s), my mother thought I was being foolish.  When I chose to<br/>
breastfeed I was &quot;limiting myself&quot; by having to be with the baby all<br/>
the time (she also didn&#39;t like it that my breastfeeding kept her from<br/>
keeping the babies overnight like my brother&#39;s child did when she was<br/>
a baby).  When I chose to allow my children to wean naturally I was<br/>
told that they were too old to be &quot;doing that&quot; and I would never have<br/>
any time to myself.  When I chose to homeschool I was neglecting their<br/>
educational needs because I could never do all that the schools do for<br/>
them.  When I chose to parent gently, it was a slap in my mom&#39;s face<br/>
because she raised me &quot;just fine&quot; the way she did it and all this &quot;ap<br/>
crap&quot; would just make for selfish and controlling children.  When I<br/>
allowed Emily to leave school in the middle of 5th grade (after having<br/>
been homeschooled previously) I was making a mistake.  I have that gut<br/>
feeling that my really felt that she had an opportunity to &quot;fix&quot; my<br/>
kids in one week.  Like in one week she would be able to &quot;undo&quot; all<br/>
the &quot;damage&quot; that I have caused my kids in their lifetimes.  (sigh)<br/>
My relationship with my mother is quite complex.  And my mother&#39;s<br/>
opinion of my children is even more complex.  Looking back I have seen<br/>
all the warning signs that leaving them with her was a wrong decision<br/>
on my part.  Things like her asking, &quot;ALL of them?&quot; when I asked her<br/>
if she would be willing to let them stay with her for 5 nights or<br/>
calling me up on Monday to ask when the &quot;little monsters&quot; are coming<br/>
over.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I wish I could just scream &quot;do over&quot; and back up.<br/>

   <br/>
  I&#39;m recalling an earlier post when you talked about this plan for the kids to stay with your Mom while you were out of town.  One where you anticipated problems for your Mom -- and given what you described then, it didn&#39;t sound as if she had any plans to respect your, or your children&#39;s, wishes. Knowing that as you did -- after all you posted about it -- why did you arrange for your kids to stay with her?  <br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;m sure there&#39;s trust lost, and relationship damage between you and your mom -- and between you and your kids.  What I wonder is why you set it up to begin with?  Maybe a look into what you expected would happen would help you sort thru this with your kids.<br/>

reassured by my mom in front of my children that issues such as<br/>
bedtime, television, food, and access to computers would NOT be a<br/>
problem.  We weren&#39;t on the plane 10 minutes before she completely did<br/>
a 180 and started enforcing rules.  This isn&#39;t about me neglecting my<br/>
children but about my mother LYING to me, repeatedly!  The longer the<br/>
weekend went the more rules that my mom piled on. My mother isn&#39;t one<br/>
that has a pattern of lying. I trusted her that when she said that the<br/>
way my children are used to doing things would be respected, even<br/>
going through what those expectations are.  My mother has been quite<br/>
upfront in the past about things and vocal about her expectations.  We<br/>
had several hours (spread out through the weeks leading up to our<br/>
departure) of discussing these things.  I didn&#39;t just willy nilly<br/>

Yes, but in an earlier post you referred to your very strong<br/>
misgivings about what would happen when you were gone. That was<br/>
probably your instincts talking! I think wanting to trust her is so <br/>
natural, but I don&#39;t think she&#39;d earned your trust up to this point.<br/>

Is that really fair?<br/>
You&#39;re asking someone to watch your children, and do it YOUR way. I<br/>
think if someone watches your children, you should EXPECT them to run<br/>
things their way. I would prep my children for exactly the way Grandma<br/>
or Grandpa do things. If that wasn&#39;t to everyone&#39;s satisfaction, I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t leave them with those particular family members.<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m watching someone&#39;s children and they laid out a bunch of rules<br/>
I disagreed with, am I obliged to follow their rules? Hell no.<br/>
I think it&#39;s rather presumptuous to expect anyone else to do things as<br/>
a  radical unschooler. It&#39;s not even fair to ask someone that doesn&#39;t<br/>
agree with you. <br/>
<br/>
No, she shouldn&#39;t have agreed to it and lied. But I think the<br/>
expectations were completely unrealistic.<br/>

<br/>
Here&#39;s what you said about the situation before leaving the kids with <br/>
your Mom, quoted from your post a couple of weeks ago. It&#39;s the only <br/>
piece of the picture I&#39;d seen before you left the kids with your Mom.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;start snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve not dealt with the rebelling issue. I have a feeling, though,<br/>
that my mother is going to deal with that this week. Dan and I are<br/>
flying up to Portland, OR on Thursday and the kids are all staying<br/>
with my mom. She has lots of rules: places and times for eating,<br/>
times for going to bed, limited electronic use (tv, computer, cell<br/>
phone), going to church (why she is insisting on taking 3 agnostic or<br/>
Pagan children to a Christian church is beyond me!). I&#39;m sure when<br/>
we get back that my mom is going to have a long list of &quot;rebel issues&quot;<br/>
that I never see. We&#39;ve assured the kids that we are just a cell<br/>
phone call away and we will intervene on their behalf. We&#39;ve raised<br/>
our children with respect and we get that respect back. Not because<br/>
we &quot;deserve&quot; or &quot;expect&quot; it but because we show it.<br/>
<br/>
Michelle<br/>
<br/>
&lt;end snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That is the only part of the picture you mentioned here.  Even then, <br/>
it looked to me like you were heading for a bad week with Grandma.  <br/>
It sounded like you&#39;d told the kids they didn&#39;t have to do what <br/>
Grandma asked of them -- that they could just call you and you&#39;d <br/>
intervene.  Knowing you&#39;d likely be called upon to intervene doesn&#39;t <br/>
sound like someone who had any reason to trust that things would work <br/>
out with Grandma.  Besides that, do you feel it&#39;s respectful to be a <br/>
guest in someone&#39;s home and behave with total disregard for their <br/>
household practices and expectations?  That was the situation you put <br/>
your Mom in -- she had houseguests who knew all they had to do was <br/>
call you to back them up when they wanted to disregard her <br/>
preferences in her own home. <br/>
<br/>
And you&#39;re surprised it turned out badly? <br/>
<br/>
I know you wanted to believe your Mom could be trusted to respect <br/>
your kids&#39; preference, but given the lifestyle differences you were <br/>
probably asking for the impossible. <br/>

Yes, it is apparent from your collecitve posts that you put your <br/>
kids&#39; interests first. This was why your first post about the planned <br/>
stay with grandma surprised me.  I commented on it earlier because it <br/>
seemed very out of character for you to put your kids in such a <br/>
potentially contentious situation where it was likely they&#39;d be <br/>
treated disrespectfully.  I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re offended, but the whole <br/>
thing felt wrong to me, and I wondered why you&#39;d left them with her, <br/>
when you expected &#39;rebelling issues.&#39;<br/>

  {{BIG HUGS}} to you and your family.  I&#39;m so sorry that your children had to endure a weekend like that!  I&#39;m sure that you felt all would be fine, and made sure of that at least 10x&#39;s before you left &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  What do you think prompted your mom to &quot;flip the script&quot; on you?  Why would she agree and then change like that?  Do you think she was just lying and trying to set your kids up to show that her way was better?  I guess &quot;why&quot; she did it may not matter as much as the fact that she did.  It&#39;s always hurtful when someone that you trust betrays that trust.  It must hurt all the more that you trusted someone that you thought you SHOULD be able to trust with the people that you treasure most on the earth.<br/>

  I hope that in the future you and your mom can reconcile, and I hope that your children are okay.<br/>

hurts for her to see the &quot;other side&quot; here. If she never has a basis  <br/>
for comparison how is she to ever know how good she has it with us!:)&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I love this example.  Besides that, it&#39;s a great lesson in learning to <br/>
deal with all sorts of different personalities ... or at least <br/>
recognizing them so you can avoid those people when you can. ;)<br/>
<br/>
I always told our oldest he had the right to question anything anyone <br/>
said, but he needed remain respectful, choose his battles, and I <br/>
recommended he also choose his timing wisely.    <br/>
<br/>
Point being, if your mother asks a question and then doesn&#39;t wait to <br/>
hear the answer... my ds would be inclined to point it out in a polite <br/>
and respectful way.  We try to remind him that most people, even at <br/>
their worst, don&#39;t really have bad intentions as much as they are <br/>
completely oblivious to the effects of their actions (and words).  It <br/>
helps him have patience, find ways to address these situations gently, <br/>
and consider the cause and effect of his own actions. <br/>
<br/>
.... he&#39;s also called me on a few things I&#39;m not too proud of, but <br/>
hey, he&#39;s learned something, right? HA HA ...</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1667938000">It is so sad when you have to let caller ID field phone calls from <br/>
your own mother but unfortunately that is also what I have to do. No <br/>
matter how old she gets, or I get for that matter, nothing ever <br/>
changes. I am still &quot;a radical&quot;, and I am still made to feel guilty <br/>
if I am not at her beck and call. I tried moving away about 600  <br/>
miles, eight years ago. As soon as my Dad retired guess where she <br/>
insisted they move to? You got it, 10 minutes from where I lived. My <br/>
Dad passed away almost two years ago and of course that was all my <br/>
fault because he wouldn&#39;t have gotten cancer if they hadn&#39;t moved <br/>
here for me(??). The fact that it was lung cancer caused by the work <br/>
he did for 40 something years had nothing to do with it! Then we <br/>
moved to a different city and she also moved to be as close as <br/>
possible. This past May we moved to the city again, due to the fact <br/>
that country life was just not what we all thought it would be, I <br/>
will save that rant for another time!!  So now she has her mobile <br/>
home up for sale because she suddenly has to move to the city as <br/>
well. My daughter and I were involved in a near fatal car accident <br/>
last year, I found out some very disturbing things about my second <br/>
husband and had demanded he move out a week before, and a lot of <br/>
other crap had gone on around the same time. But, to hear it from her <br/>
she is the one who is so needy, and all my problems and what <br/>
happened,  again have to do with the fact that everyone&#39;s &quot;luck&quot; has <br/>
been so bad since we moved to Pennsylvania. When I tell her I do not <br/>
believe in luck she gets irate. So once again it is all my fault that <br/>
theses terrible things have happened and I need to  be constantly <br/>
reminded and made to feel guilty over all of it.<br/>
<br/>
Whew!! that was so long....sorry I needed to  vent I guess. The last <br/>
post just brought so much of this to surface !!<br/>
<br/>
By the way I am Lorrie from Pennsylvania, and I unschool my 15 year <br/>
old daughter, and have a 21 year old son that was also unschooled.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I wish everyone a great holiday season....peace,<br/>
lorrie<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1322070630">Michelle,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new here, and not sure how welcome my opinion is, but I thought <br/>
I&#39;d toss in my two cents :)<br/>
<br/>
I have a similar situation with my mother, so I can sympathise. <br/>
However, you know the saying &quot;beggars can&#39;t be choosers&quot;? <br/>
<br/>
I think that while your mother should respect your parenting wishes, <br/>
you should also respect her ways of doing things in her home.<br/>
<br/>
You knew from the get go that things were not going to work out, but <br/>
yet became upset when it happened... which makes no sense to me.<br/>
<br/>
If you call upon someone to take time from their daily life and <br/>
watch your children in their OWN home, I would just assume that you <br/>
would have respect for HER rules and HER ways while your children <br/>
were at her house.<br/>
<br/>
Example...<br/>
If someone were to come to my house with their pet (let&#39;s say a dog) <br/>
and let it go to the bathroom all over my house, and then think <br/>
nothing of it... I would be furious. And them telling me that it&#39;s <br/>
okay because the dog does it at home... that would mean nothing to <br/>
me. I do not care what that dog does at his/her house. This is my <br/>
house and things run differently here, just as they do in everyone&#39;s <br/>
house. Like they say... to each his own.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is selfish to tell someone you need them to watch your <br/>
children and then tell them exactly the way they are to do it. I <br/>
would simply be greatful that she would watch them to begin with.<br/>
<br/>
My questions for you...<br/>
<br/>
#1 Why even leave them with her knowing what they outcome would <br/>
probably be, like you had stated earlier?<br/>
<br/>
#2 If you need things run in the exact way that you want them done, <br/>
why not hire a sitter while you were gone? Then you can lay down the <br/>
rules, and after all, they are being paid to do what you tell them.<br/>
<br/>
#3 Why tell your child that they could just call you up and you <br/>
would handle things if that were not the case. If you knew your <br/>
mother would do this, what makes you think that you could pull rank <br/>
on her from 3000 miles away? <br/>
<br/>
Not trying to stir any trouble here, just thought that maybe if you <br/>
saw it from an outsiders perspective it may help next time :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-13985216">I agree that it is often the best thing to cut yourself off from a toxic <br/>
family member.  I had to do just that with my SIL who was truly dangerous. <br/>
Oh, the stories I could tell.  We explained to her that we would be asking <br/>
for a no-contact order and prosecute for harrassment, false charges and <br/>
whatever else we needed to do if she didn&#39;t just leave us in peace of her <br/>
own accord.  Fortunately, she chose to leave us in peace.  I&#39;d be surprised <br/>
if we ever see her or hear from her again, although we do hear OF her more <br/>
often than I&#39;d like.  She&#39;s doing a fine job messing up her own family.<br/>
<br/>
What I meant about giving the power if you do something that is not of your <br/>
family&#39;s choosing wasn&#39;t this kind of case.  What I meant is that I don&#39;t <br/>
think anybody should sell their house and move halfway across the country <br/>
just to end contact with their family, unless it is what everyone in the <br/>
family wants.  A move and a fresh start can be great, but if you do it just <br/>
to get away from someone, there is always the chance that they will follow <br/>
you, and then you start a cycle of running.  KWIM?  I hope I&#39;m making sense.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m inartfuly saying is that ending a relationship with anyone who <br/>
threatens to rend the fabric of your family life is completely <br/>
understandable.  But it is HOW you do it that matters, so that you don&#39;t put <br/>
yourself in a position where they retain any power over you.<br/>

That&#39;s a really good point...hadn&#39;t thought of it that way since I<br/>
don&#39;t have these issues!  If a move is in the best interest of the<br/>
family, and something that brings joy then great. But yeah, I can see<br/>
where moving away could be a bad choice if it&#39;s just to get away from<br/>
someone and not what the family really wants. <br/>
<br/>
If contact truly needs to end, then the person ending contact needs to<br/>
find the strength and resolve to set boundaries wherever they choose<br/>
to be.<br/>
