<div id="ygrps-yiv-524672275">Hello Dads!! <br/>
<br/>
May 1, 2 &3 in the mountains near Johnson City, TN we are hosting our <br/>
1st Dads&#39; Weekend.  What is a Dads&#39; Weekend? Well we&#39;re not really <br/>
sure.  The Dads in NE TN had an idea to rent a cabin in the <br/>
beautiful mountains of TN and just hang out, talk about being an <br/>
unschooling Dad, how it&#39;s going, maybe some drinking, card games, <br/>
cycling, nerf gun tag (Scotty&#39;s fave)…whatever we all wanted to do.  <br/>
As the word spread, more and more Dads showed an interest so we <br/>
decided to invite all Dads.<br/>
<br/>
Accommodations:<br/>
Each cabin has 1 queen and 2 twin beds.  With blow-up beds on the <br/>
living room floor the cabins sleep 4-6.  Each cabin has a full <br/>
kitchen with plates, cups, etc and costs $114 a night. (Divided by 4 <br/>
not bad)  There are no TVs or phones.  Wireless internet is a ten <br/>
minute walk to the main building.  You will need to bring all your <br/>
own food and drink for the weekend.  The closest town in 20 minutes <br/>
away.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1148072012">I think my husband would LOVE to do that, however, that is the week we open our new business.  If you hear of any other event or have them do this again, let me know so I can ask him about it.  How about a Mom&#39;s Weekend???  Almost everything we do has the kids with us.  Any events like that where the moms can get together in the woods and just hang out???  I would LOVE that, too.<br/>
