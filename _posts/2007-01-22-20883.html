<div id="ygrps-yiv-1174275060">unschoolingbasicsWhat has happened in many unschooling homes where sweet foods are treated<br/>
the same as other foods is that sweets hold no special powers over kids.<br/>
<br/>
**I have to say, this is what happens around here. We have a variety of everything available all the time. But my nightly ritual is to have a dessert after dinner, as part of evening couch potato-ing. <br/>
<br/>
**And I am always so surprised when an evening call of &quot;I&#39;m getting some ice cream, does anybody else want any?&quot; gets a ho-hum &quot;No thanks, Mom&quot; from everyone -- except me and DH. :) <br/>
<br/>
**I have so say though, the Girl Scout cookies disappear with lightening speed! :)<br/>
