<div id="ygrps-yiv-665029471">I live in Idaho and I am wondering whether it is legal to unschool <br/>
here.  Homeschooling laws are very lax here, but I&#39;m not sure about <br/>
outright unschooling.  I have been transitioning to unschooling and <br/>
now only have my kids do math.  However, I still read to them in the <br/>
morning...historical stuff as each year we have gone through a <br/>
historical period.  When I say &quot;who wants to hear me read such and <br/>
such?&quot; and sit down with my coffe, they are agreeable and want to <br/>
listen, so I consider this pretty much unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I am afraid to admit to other moms that I am unschooling.  <br/>
For some reason, all of my boys&#39; friends are in school. I worry the <br/>
moms would be very upset that I&#39;m not &quot;teaching&quot; them and the <br/>
friendship may be jeoparized.  However, if I am unschooling, I don&#39;t <br/>
want to live a lie.  Right now, people will make little comments <br/>
like &quot;I&#39;ll call you in the afternoon because I know you&#39;re getting <br/>
your schooling done in the morning&quot;, which is what I have done for <br/>
years.  They ask about what curriculum I use and how do I get all of <br/>
the curriculum done, etc. I am thinking I should ask my boys for <br/>
input, but it seems like I am placing a burden on them as they won&#39;t <br/>
want to risk losing their friends and they won&#39;t want to tell me to <br/>
lie because they are honest.  Any ideas?  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Right  now, people will make little comments <br/>
like &quot;I&#39;ll call you in the afternoon  because I know you&#39;re getting <br/>
your schooling done in the morning&quot;, <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*****************<br/>
 <br/>
I find that simple is best.  So &quot;OK&quot;.  Or if you want might want  to hear <br/>
from them earlier &quot;It is fine if you call earlier, I&#39;ll let you know if  I can&#39;t <br/>
talk&quot;.  If they question that, say &quot;we are finding ourselves more  flexible <br/>
these days&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
When asked about curriculum, I say &quot;Oh, I find that a more individualized  <br/>
approach works better.&quot;  I might follow up with something about them being  <br/>
expensive, or that the internet opens us up to so many possibilities, or that  the <br/>
children are thriving.  I might say something about homeschooling being  such <br/>
a common thing these days that there are far more resources than a  pricey <br/>
box of curriculum.<br/>
 <br/>
Or, you might say when asked how you are getting it done &quot;the boys  happily <br/>
learn at their own pace, at home we just don&#39;t have to worry about time  <br/>
constraints!&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
All said with a confident smile on your face.  You might find yourself  <br/>
spouting on about unschooling at some point.  :)<br/>
 <br/>
Unfortunately, your friendships might adjust a bit.  But mostly it  will be <br/>
because *you* are tired of the school talk.<br/>
 <br/>
As for your boys, I have no idea.  At this point, my kids don&#39;t know  any <br/>
different than to say they play all day and wonder why someone would think  <br/>
otherwise.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi, Beth, I am up in North Idaho.  I can&#39;t think of an easier state to<br/>
unschool in!  It is perfectly legal.  All Idaho requires is that the<br/>
children receive a &quot;comparable education&quot; but I couldn&#39;t find any<br/>
definition of what that means exactly. As you already know, Idaho<br/>
doesn&#39;t require any portfolios, testing, or anything.  As far as I can<br/>
tell from reading the laws and talking to other homeschoolers, you<br/>
just let the school know that you are going to homeschool your kids<br/>
with a &quot;letter of intent&quot; and you&#39;re done.  If they have never gone to<br/>
school or are already homeschooling, then you are already done with that.<br/>
<br/>
But maybe what you are saying is that you are worried someone will<br/>
question you?  I can understand that!  To stave off my own fears and<br/>
Parental Panic Attacks, I keep a log of what the kids are doing.  I<br/>
also hang on to things they have done or take a picture of it, if it<br/>
is something that won&#39;t fit into a file.  This isn&#39;t really part of<br/>
the unschooling philosophy nor is it required by Idaho law, but it<br/>
helps me feel safe.  I do occasionally worry that someone will decide<br/>
I am doing &quot;nothing&quot; with my kids and send the authorities over to<br/>
check us out.  By keeping a daily log/journal of our activities, I<br/>
have something to show the authorities if the come along.  Plus, it is<br/>
kind of fun.  I am thinking of creating &quot;memory scrapbooks&quot; for each<br/>
kid and maybe even their own blogs too. (I want to emphasize here that<br/>
this is all something that I do for my own peace of mind and my kids<br/>
are for the most part oblivious to it.  And I never force them into<br/>
activities just so I can get it logged - geez, that would not be<br/>
unschooling.)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have any helpful advice for not being able to speak about it<br/>
to others because I am exactly the same way!  Even to other<br/>
homeschoolers, I am very cautious about how I describe what we do and<br/>
I avoid the word &quot;unschool&quot; like the plague.  Everyone up here<br/>
schools-at-home or does the virtual academy.  They automatically<br/>
assume I either do Abeka or IDVA, so I just say, &quot;We do more of<br/>
child-led learning instead of boxed curriculum learning.&quot;  I know, I<br/>
am a wuss!<br/>
<br/>
hope that helps,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Nah, not a wuss.  It&#39;s just so much easier than trying to explain (and<br/>
then defend) unschooling to people who have NO understanding of it at<br/>
all.  :-D  I&#39;m sure even our &quot;pros&quot; do the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and because Abeka is developed here in Pensacola people<br/>
automatically assume that is what I use.  I get it all the time.  &quot;Oh,<br/>
you homeschool?  I suppose you use Abeka.&quot;  (sigh)<br/>
