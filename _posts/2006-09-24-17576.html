Emily  asked me today if there were any colleges that offered<br/>
&quot;non-traditional  forms of study.&quot; She said that she liked the idea of<br/>
pursuing a higher  education, but knows that traditional university<br/>
study would not be a good  match for her. So I did some surfing today<br/>
and found this one:<br/>

<br/>
They  even have a page dedicated to homeschool admissions. I wrote to<br/>
a friend of  mine who I respect asking about this college and she says<br/>
that this college  actively pursues homeschooled students as they tend<br/>
to fit their  alternative form of education better. I liked how they<br/>
addressed the lack  of formal classes, transcripts, graded projects and<br/>
diplomas.<br/>

What  I did find interesting is that part of the first year is spent<br/>
&quot;teaching&quot;  students how to learn and how learning is not natural to<br/>
most incoming  first years. I wonder what they would think of a bunch<br/>
of unschoolers who  have had the freedom to really learn!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-41065108">I don&#39;t know if this is too late for you but when I was looking at<br/>
colleges way too many years ago, I loved Colorado College. It was not<br/>
exactly unschooling but I remember you took one class at a time for<br/>
total immersion. And I&#39;m not sure there were grades. I think there<br/>
were not and that was what my parents had against it because how would<br/>
you get into grad school then.<br/>
