notify the school district of your intent to homeschool and you never need<br/>
do anything ever again.  While other states have more stringent<br/>
requirements.  It is important to know what your state requirements are.  I<br/>
have found it very interesting that when some parents have notified their<br/>
districts of intent to homeschool the local district will make homeschooling<br/>
sound like it is difficult with tons of hoops to jump through and lots of<br/>
requirements.  Yet, none of these hoops are required by the state.  It&#39;s a<br/>
&quot;scare tactic&quot; to make parents think it would be just easier to keep their<br/>
child in the school system.  Or they are made up by a school district<br/>
employee who doesn&#39;t know the state laws.<br/>
<br/>
If you are living in a state that has lots of requirements, the best thing<br/>
to do is to look for an unschooling group in your state.  I bet most of the<br/>
states have a  &quot;Your state Unschooling&quot; yahoogroup.  These families are<br/>
masters at how to word unschooling lifestyles into schoolish looking<br/>
jargon.  :)<br/>

association, sign a statement that we are doing equivilant to the state.<br/>
That&#39;s all the legally need. Now what they want may be a different thing.<br/>
Read your state law and give them only what is required.<br/>

Or, tell us where you are.  Each state is different and some districts<br/>
differ with the state. <br/>
