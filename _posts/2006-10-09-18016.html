<div id="ygrps-yiv-1379154382">~~&gt; I&#39;m in Florida. I just re-read the county&#39;s requirements and yes,<br/>
I need to keep a file of &quot;proof of learning&quot; I&#39;ll call it, along with<br/>
what&#39;s taught for two years.~~<br/>
<br/>
Even if you choose to go the route of a portfolio OR testing (you<br/>
don&#39;t do both, just one or the other) it&#39;s really no big deal in<br/>
Florida. I know of an unschool friendly evaluator in Pensacola and I&#39;m<br/>
sure there are some in other areas as well.<br/>
<br/>
If you choose a portfolio review, just save ticket stubs, brochures<br/>
etc...and take photos of all the cool stuff your kids do and make a<br/>
scrapbook out of it. That, along with a list of resources you all use<br/>
will satisfy any relaxed teacher. Any teacher that is certified can<br/>
review the portfolio. Our portfolios were always scrapbook style so I<br/>
would never get rid of them anyway....two years was no big deal.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody ever asked to see our portfolios and we eventually went<br/>
underground and quit answering to any authority there. The review is<br/>
pretty easy, even for unschoolers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1320649606">That makes me feel much better.  I found an evaluator, close to home, and will be getting that out of the way in early December.  (It&#39;s due to the county Jan 8th).<br/>
  thanks for the great info!<br/>
