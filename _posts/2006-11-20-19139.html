 </span></blockquote>Ren, I have a solution for you :-)  Find a dog that has *hair* not<br/>
fur.  Poodles, schnauzers, bichon fris (sp?), Cane and Yorkshire<br/>
Terriers, shi tzu&#39;s, and Lhaso Apso are all &quot;hair&quot; dogs.  They don&#39;t<br/>
have an undercoat and therefore don&#39;t shed (also good for keeping the<br/>
house cleaner!)  Poodles and schnauzers include the standard to<br/>
miniature sizes, so if she was wanting a big dog she could get a<br/>
standard poodle or schnauzer.  If she is looking for a medium sized<br/>
dog, there are several there and there are quite a few smaller dogs,<br/>
which Markus might be more inclined to accept (especially if it isn&#39;t<br/>
much bigger than a rat &lt;bwg&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
You want to make sure you get a full breed dog and not something like<br/>
a peek-a-poo (part pekinese part poodle) because you can&#39;t be assured<br/>
of whether they will shed or not.  While getting a dog with a<br/>
&quot;pedigree&quot; can be expensive, almost every breed has a &quot;rescue society&quot;<br/>
for that breed.  That&#39;s how my parents go their Sheltie.  A friend of<br/>
mine got a Golden Retriever through a similar company.  Sometimes you<br/>
have to travel a bit to find one close to you, but it can be well<br/>
worth it.  Another option is to look to your vet or PETA friendly<br/>
animal shelter and let them know you are looking for one of these<br/>
breeds.  Most will call you when they find one that needs a good home.<br/>
 Sierra may even be able to negotiate herself to one for a lot less by<br/>
agreeing to come and play with the puppies and clean up after them and<br/>
walk the adult dogs.<br/>
<br/>
I found this list (love Google):<br/>

<br/>
Which seemed pretty comprehensive.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who has a child who is HIGHLY allregic to animals (and<br/>
just about anything) and I only see this lady once a month when we get<br/>
together to stamp.  Few people can go to her house as they might track<br/>
in animal fur and dander and if you do get an invitation, you have to<br/>
leave your coat and shoes outside.  What is weird (at least to me) is<br/>
that my friend sends her daughter to public school.  The child has to<br/>
take 2 different medication plus an injection *every day* in order to<br/>
be able to make it through the school day.  When she gets home she has<br/>
to have all her clothes thrown in the washing machine and she has to<br/>
shower and wash her hair!  I mean this kid has *serious* allergies.<br/>
The mother&#39;s primary reason for public school is (you got it)<br/>
socialization!!  ARG!!!!  Anyway, I was surprised when I found out<br/>
that they had a poodle.  She said that her daughter has no problems<br/>
with poodles at all.  So go for a poodle.  LOL!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Greyhounds may or may not work.  They do shed horribly even though<br/>
they have short hair and they do have an undercoat though one wouldn&#39;t<br/>
think so.  My parents had a retired greyhound for a while.  ONe of the<br/>
problems that people have with retired greyhounds is that they tend to<br/>
have health issues.  Why would someone retire a perfectly healthy<br/>
greyhound?  It is downplayed by the rescue people and books promoting<br/>
retired greyhounds, but the more my parents looked into getting a<br/>
second greyhound after Mike died the more they found out that they<br/>
tend to only live for 2-4 years once adopted (although it does vary)<br/>
and most have continuing health problems (many with forms of diabetes<br/>
- which Mike died from after only being with them for 4 months).  They<br/>
are VERY sweet dogs, my parents just decided that the heartbreak in<br/>
falling in love with a dog that would die so shortly after coming to<br/>
live with them was too difficult for them.  Our family tends to have<br/>
animals for 13-22 years, so 2-4 seemed so short.  A lot of emotional<br/>
energy.  Now if you were interested in a greyhound puppy that&#39;s<br/>
another story (and expect to have it run as they do love running!)<br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
Yes, true. But dander is the thing that allergic people are allergic to, and<br/>
not all dog breeds produce dander. The labradoodles I&#39;ve met have been what<br/>
I would call &quot;casually&quot; groomed, that is, the families brushed them fairly<br/>
regularly, but none of them did regular &quot;professional&quot; grooming, and their<br/>
family members who were allergic had NO problems with these dogs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-822217205">I&#39;m one of those people who is allergic to everything.  I can tell you that <br/>
I spent a bunch of time with a soft coated wheaton in my lap, petted her <br/>
(because I&#39;m a sucker) and then could not wash my hands for about an hour <br/>
afterwards.  I never sneezed.  This is virtually unheard of for me.  I&#39;ve <br/>
sneezed from poodles, schnauzers, Chinese Cresteds, and lots of dogs on the <br/>
list.  This dog never bothered me.<br/>
<br/>
My best advice about getting a dog is to let your daughter spend as much <br/>
time as you can with the particular dog that you are considering getting and <br/>
see her reaction.  Hair versus fur doesn&#39;t guarantee anything.  But personal <br/>
contact will tell the truth.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!  I&#39;d love a dog, but &lt;sniff&gt; know it just is not in the cards for <br/>
me or my oft snuffy son.<br/>

&gt;miniature sizes, so if she was wanting a big dog she could get a<br/>
&gt;standard poodle or schnauzer.  If she is looking for a medium sized<br/>
&gt;dog, there are several there and there are quite a few smaller dogs,<br/>
&gt;which Markus might be more inclined to accept (especially if it isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;much bigger than a rat &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You want to make sure you get a full breed dog and not something like<br/>
&gt;a peek-a-poo (part pekinese part poodle) because you can&#39;t be assured<br/>
&gt;of whether they will shed or not.  While getting a dog with a<br/>
&gt;&quot;pedigree&quot; can be expensive, almost every breed has a &quot;rescue society&quot;<br/>
&gt;for that breed.  That&#39;s how my parents go their Sheltie.  A friend of<br/>
&gt;mine got a Golden Retriever through a similar company.  Sometimes you<br/>
&gt;have to travel a bit to find one close to you, but it can be well<br/>
&gt;worth it.  Another option is to look to your vet or PETA friendly<br/>
&gt;animal shelter and let them know you are looking for one of these<br/>
&gt;breeds.  Most will call you when they find one that needs a good home.<br/>
&gt;  Sierra may even be able to negotiate herself to one for a lot less by<br/>
&gt;agreeing to come and play with the puppies and clean up after them and<br/>
&gt;walk the adult dogs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I found this list (love Google):<br/>
&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0618517529&id=R9wCs9yQtocC&pg=PA189">http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0618517529&id=R9wCs9yQtocC&pg=PA189</a><br/>
&gt;&lpg=PA189&dq=45+best+dogs&sig=HcaK47CLAraKslp-QAD2V_TvYMY<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Which seemed pretty comprehensive.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have a friend who has a child who is HIGHLY allregic to animals (and<br/>
&gt;just about anything) and I only see this lady once a month when we get<br/>
&gt;together to stamp.  Few people can go to her house as they might track<br/>
&gt;in animal fur and dander and if you do get an invitation, you have to<br/>
&gt;leave your coat and shoes outside.  What is weird (at least to me) is<br/>
&gt;that my friend sends her daughter to public school.  The child has to<br/>
&gt;take 2 different medication plus an injection *every day* in order to<br/>
&gt;be able to make it through the school day.  When she gets home she has<br/>
&gt;to have all her clothes thrown in the washing machine and she has to<br/>
&gt;shower and wash her hair!  I mean this kid has *serious* allergies.<br/>
&gt;The mother&#39;s primary reason for public school is (you got it)<br/>
&gt;socialization!!  ARG!!!!  Anyway, I was surprised when I found out<br/>
&gt;that they had a poodle.  She said that her daughter has no problems<br/>
&gt;with poodles at all.  So go for a poodle.  LOL!<br/>

One act of their &quot;animal liberation&quot; involves &quot;setting free&quot; dogs in <br/>

PETA&#39;s take was that their &quot;accidental&quot; deaths were better than a life <br/>

<br/>
This particular example is personal. They&#39;ve done far worse on a <br/>

<br/>
There are plenty of other animal rights organizations that don&#39;t <br/>

  Our family tends to have<br/>
animals for 13-22 years, so 2-4 seemed so short.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
NO greyhound will live for 22 years!<br/>
<br/>
The breed has a short lifespan compared to smaller breeds. Thirteen is <br/>
OLD. Fifteen is DEAD. Most live probably 12-14 years on the outside. <br/>
Great Danes and Mastiff, for example have an even shorter lifespan.<br/>
<br/>
Most are retired from racing between 2-5 years. I don&#39;t think they race <br/>
beyond 5. If a dog is retired at 5, another 5-7 years is a long time <br/>
and an old age.<br/>
<br/>
Keeping in mind that they have a not-so-pleasant puppy-/young <br/>
adult-hood, I think that nine isn&#39;t all that young! With that hard <br/>
young life comes a predisposition for health problems. I&#39;ve never heard <br/>
of diabetes being a breed-specific problem. Bloat and difficulty with <br/>
anesthesia are the two biggies with greyhounds.<br/>

Yes, true. But dander is the thing that allergic people are allergic <br/>
to, and<br/>
not all dog breeds produce dander. The labradoodles I&#39;ve met have been <br/>
what<br/>
I would call &quot;casually&quot; groomed, that is, the families brushed them <br/>
fairly<br/>
regularly, but none of them did regular &quot;professional&quot; grooming, and <br/>
their<br/>
family members who were allergic had NO problems with these dogs.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Dander comes from the skin and the dried saliva that flakes of the <br/>
hairs of dogs and cats that lick (dried saliva).<br/>
<br/>
All dogs produce dander. If a dog has skin and spit, he has dander.<br/>
<br/>
A dog that is groomed regularly will have a reduced amount of dander <br/>
that is airborne or that sticks to surfaces. The big deterrent is to <br/>
fluff-dry the dog with a forced air dryer. Don&#39;t just towel-dry the dog <br/>
or allow the dog to &quot;air dry&quot; or to sit and lick himself dry---that <br/>
only builds up more dander. Brushing helps---the dander sticks to the <br/>
brush. If the brush is cleaned well afterwards, the dander gets washed <br/>
away.<br/>
<br/>
Moisturizers and gentle oatmeal shampoos help. So does a good diet. <br/>
Younger dogs produce less dander than older dogs because of the amount <br/>
of oil in the coat (fewer flakes AND less licking of dry, itchy skin).<br/>
<br/>
ALL dogs produce dander. The lickers produce more.<br/>

<br/>
PETA is NOT an animal *welfare* organization. Welfare implies that they <br/>
*care for* animals. They don&#39;t. None of their money or effort goes to <br/>
*caring for* animals---just to furthering their goal of animal rights. <br/>
Even if that means violence.<br/>
<br/>
They want to &quot;liberate&quot; animals from the bondage of man. Their agenda <br/>
does NOT include taking care of them. Their goals are that we&#39;re not <br/>
wearing them, eating them, or owning them---or feeding or interacting <br/>
with them in any way other than to watch them---but hell, even *that* <br/>
could be considered invasive. What *are* we to do with them? Just let <br/>
them all go frolicking in a meadow.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-283651479">In the UK the best inappropriate animal liberation story I know is when some <br/>
animal rights group liberated all of the America Minks into the wild. The <br/>
minks are now taking over the waterways and out-competing a lot of the <br/>
native species here. Fortunately otters like to eat them, which may give the <br/>
water vole fighting chance. And help out the otters as well.<br/>

One of the big things that PETA is trying to do right now is save the<br/>
Chinese right to have pet dogs.  China is rounding up dogs that they<br/>
feel are excessive, large or dangerous (despite whether the dog truly<br/>
is) and killing them.  PETA is trying to work with the government to<br/>
help people retain their beloved pets.  PETA is responsible for<br/>
elephant regulations with circuses.  While their ultimate goal would<br/>
be that there are no elephants at circuses, they will support<br/>
regulations that work towards better treatment of those circus animals<br/>
(and other circus animals).  I&#39;ve never joined PETA because I do eat<br/>
meat on occasion (there will be no icky tofurky at my dinner table on<br/>
Thursday) and I do wear leather as well sometimes.  I do try to assure<br/>
that the sources for that meat and leather come from more humane<br/>
places such as free range farms and low cruelty killing practices.  I<br/>
buy a lot of leather that comes from hunters rather than cow leather<br/>
where I&#39;m not sure of how the animal may have been killed (cruelly?)<br/>
And I live with a hunter who honors the animal that he shoots and does<br/>
his best to make sure that as much of the animals is used, making its<br/>
death mean more than just a trophy on his wall (of which we have no<br/>
trophies).<br/>
<br/>

eyes pinned open for toxic testing. The MAJORITY has no idea that PETA <br/>
wants to do away with &quot;pet ownership.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
One of the big things that PETA is trying to do right now is save the<br/>
Chinese right to have pet dogs.  China is rounding up dogs that they<br/>
feel are excessive, large or dangerous (despite whether the dog truly<br/>
is) and killing them.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Due to a rabies outbreak, the Chinese government killed thousands of <br/>
dogs. Some dogs may not have had the disease. China is notorious for a <br/>
lack of HUMAN rights. Dogs can hardly claim MORE than the Chinese <br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
They also kill dogs for fur. Sometimes for food.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 PETA is trying to work with the government to<br/>
help people retain their beloved pets.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Many of these dogs are feral. The government makes little distinction. <br/>
Our local governments put down thousands of animals each year. I <br/>
volunteered at an Air Force Base shelter. WE put down an average of 55 <br/>
animals each month.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve never joined PETA because I do eat<br/>
meat on occasion (there will be no icky tofurky at my dinner table on<br/>
Thursday) and I do wear leather as well sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you think ALL PETA members are vegans??? There are thousands upon <br/>
thousands of PETA members---like your grandma---who just think furs are <br/>
bad. They don&#39;t KNOW what all&#39;s on the table.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I do try to assure<br/>
that the sources for that meat and leather come from more humane<br/>
places such as free range farms and low cruelty killing practices.  I<br/>
buy a lot of leather that comes from hunters rather than cow leather<br/>
where I&#39;m not sure of how the animal may have been killed (cruelly?)<br/>
And I live with a hunter who honors the animal that he shoots and does<br/>
his best to make sure that as much of the animals is used, making its<br/>
death mean more than just a trophy on his wall (of which we have no<br/>
trophies).<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
You have WAY too many anti-PETA issues. You might want to look into the <br/>
organization some more.<br/>
<br/>
=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Please don&#39;t judge PETA based on the extremists that are in the news.<br/>

I use to be pro-PETA until what happened to my friend&#39;s whippets. I <br/>
learned a LOT about them in a very short time. Luckily I was IN the <br/>
ring with my dogs, or mine would have been targeted too. My van was two <br/>
cars down from the whippets. I don&#39;t judge based on &quot;extremists in the <br/>
news&quot;---I was THERE.<br/>
<br/>
Please don&#39;t assume that PETA is not an EXTREME organization. Do more <br/>
research.<br/>
