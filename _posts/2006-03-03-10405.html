<div id="ygrps-yiv-1395068324">Hi Melanie, I get the same thing. I homeschool/unschool my three kids 7  yr old b/g twins and 3 year old daughter. I actually have family who  whenever we get together will say, so what have you guys learned today,  why dont you read this for me etc. as if to test them. I do get the  same from others. I was at the grocery store and the check out lady  said dont you kids have school today and they said we dont go to school  we learn at home and she said wow then why are you at the store in the  middle of the school day. I (who usually can get pretty rude if needed)  just ignored her. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-138918624">Hi Melanie,<br/>
<br/>
I think what you posted, about it &quot;being between her and her mom&quot; is <br/>
a great answer. Or how about suggesting that she tell them about <br/>
something she&#39;s interested in. <br/>
<br/>
My daughter Shawna thinks it great fun to tell people that <br/>
ask...&quot;I&#39;m to cool for school&quot;. I&#39;m not sure where she got that <br/>
from, maybe she made it up but it&#39;s kinda funny. Or lately when <br/>
people ask her what school she goes to, instead of saying she&#39;s <br/>
homeschooled, she tells them she doesn&#39;t go to school. They usually <br/>
get a weird look on their face because she&#39;s 10 year old. I think <br/>
she just likes to see their expression. LOL<br/>
<br/>
Jacqueline on the other hand will go into great details about how <br/>
she&#39;s teaching herself all about the solar system or how she&#39;s <br/>
learning Italian on her own. <br/>

Any <br/>
  suggestions on how to handle ?&#39;s and comments?<br/>
  <br/>
If the questions are coming from well meaning family and friends then I might <br/>
consider offering explanations about freedom and unschooling.  If the <br/>
questions are coming from nosey strangers or well acting, intrusive, judgmental <br/>
family or friends I offer very little if any response.  Sometimes a chuckle is <br/>
enough of a response to end invasive questioning.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I was at the grocery store and the check out lady said dont you kids have <br/>
school today and they said we dont go to school  we learn at home and she said <br/>
wow then why are you at the store in the  middle of the school day. I (who <br/>
usually can get pretty rude if needed)  just ignored her. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We get a lot of questions, too.  My children are 8, 6 and 2 and I have <br/>
noticed that this year more than ever we are getting asked by all kinds of <br/>
strangers.  Almost daily.  The older they get the more people wonder why they aren&#39;t in <br/>
school.  If one is rude enough to ask beyond the initial &quot;No school today?&quot; <br/>
question, like the lady did to your daughter, my favorite response is:  The <br/>
children have a highly contagious infection so we have been banned from attending <br/>
our usual activities.  Its called inquisitivitis.  Then we all giggle and <br/>
sneeze.  <br/>
<br/>
A quick response to no school today is -- I don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
If my children are made to feel even the slightest bit uncomfortable by an <br/>
inquisitive stranger I usually protect them by pulling them close and sometimes <br/>
getting between them and the interrogator.  An elderly lady bugged my dd so I <br/>
grabbed my daughter and praised her for not talking to strangers.  We both <br/>
smiled and I thanked the lady for bagging.  I think some people just don&#39;t <br/>
realize what they are doing.  For a milder approach to the not-so-bright I respond - <br/>
Our family homeschools.  If someone asked us why we were in the store in the <br/>
middle of the day I might say - We&#39;re shopping.<br/>
<br/>
Try to keep a sense of humor about it.  As my kids get older they are coming <br/>
up with their own responses.  No school today?<br/>
<br/>
There isn&#39;t?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I love &quot;I&#39;m too cool for school&quot; that someone posted.  My kids will love that <br/>
one.<br/>
<br/>
Take it all with a grain of salt.  You are doing what you know is best for <br/>
your family.  <br/>
<br/>
Peace and joy,<br/>

I used to like to tell people when they asked about curriculum that we were  <br/>
doing Multicultural Vocational Training -- we were going to teach him to ask <br/>
&quot;Do  you want fries with that?&quot; in thirteen languages. It tended to break the <br/>
ice and  make people laugh, and they were much more receptive to hearing what <br/>
our lives  were REALLY like.<br/>
 <br/>
My favorite one was when Julian was just out of school, after we pulled him  <br/>
out after third grade. Most people were very supportive, but one woman, the  <br/>
mother of one of his friends who was also a School Board member, was very  <br/>
negative.<br/>
 <br/>
We ran into her at the library, where Julian was looking at the computer  <br/>
catalog for books. She came over and snottily asked how the homeschooling was  <br/>
going. Well, before I could say a word, Julian, who had recently read The Giver, <br/>
 which led to his interest in other utopian novels, said, excitedly, &quot;Great! <br/>
I&#39;m  looking for more utopian things to read, and the computer mentioned <br/>
Plato&#39;s  Republic, but my mom said that might be a bit much for me right now, so <br/>
I&#39;m  looking for more stuff!&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
Darlene muttered something like &quot;how nice,&quot; and quickly walked off. I just  <br/>
laughed, looked at Julian, and said, &quot;Good answer!&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1237001817">Hi Joanne:<br/>
<br/>
I saw your note on the unschooling basics list & was wondering how your daughter is teaching herself Italian? One of my boys wants to learn German (he just mentioned it a few days ago) and it would be good to find some resources for him... I&#39;d love some suggestions from you!<br/>
<br/>
I loved what you said about your DD telling people she doesn&#39;t go to school, maybe just to see the expressions on their faces... &lt;lol&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re new to unschooling & homeschooling having just pulled our oldest 3 out of public school after the school year ended last May... at first we tried to do the Robinson Curriculum and I had so much trouble getting them to do the math (Saxon math) and writing that I let up on it.. we were about to move anyway so I figured we could start with &quot;curriculum stuff&quot; after the move & that they&#39;d learn plenty through the process of renovating the house... well, we&#39;ve been here since a couple of days before Christmas and since then I came to the conclusion that unschooling/interest led would be best for us... &lt;grin&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Jacqueline on the other hand will go into great details about how <br/>
&gt; she&#39;s teaching herself all about the solar system or how she&#39;s <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>re: easy states to homeschool in.. I know Texas & Oklahoma are easy states to homeschool in... they say what subjects need to be covered, but no one checks.... I simply had to send the boys&#39; old school a letter informing them that I was withdrawing them to teach them at home and when we moved, we did not have to let anyone know... the only way we&#39;ll have to communicate with the school system is if they come & talk to us & I would try sending them a letter & if necessary, I can get help from the THSC (Tx homeschool coalition)... <br/>
<br/>
Hopefully it&#39;ll remain that way, but I&#39;ve heard that there are some people trying to get this changed so that people will have to account, ugh... <br/>

Hey Jessica :-)<br/>
<br/>
I started telling my kids some simple words in Italian and <br/>
Jacqueline (age 7) wanted to know more that I remembered. My <br/>
grandparents (on both sides) were from Italy and I knew more when <br/>
they were alive and it was spoken more. I bought two different <br/>
Italian translation books (at a flea market for $1 each!) and she <br/>
reads them often. Also, if there&#39;s a specific word or phrase she <br/>
wants to know we look it up here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.freetranslation.com/">http://www.freetranslation.com/</a><br/>
or<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/">http://babelfish.altavista.com/</a><br/>
We also have a small chalk board in our kitchen and every week or <br/>
so, I&#39;ll write another phrase on there and we all spend the week <br/>
walking around saying it. LOL This week is &quot;Amo la mia famiglia&quot;, <br/>
which means &quot;I love my family&quot;. :-)  <br/>
<br/>
The words and phrases that she&#39;s teaching herself are ones that she <br/>
uses in her daily life because she wants to be able to use it. So <br/>
it&#39;s common for her to answer me in Italian when I ask something <br/>
like &quot;Are you hungry?&quot;, she&#39;ll answer &quot;Si madre&quot;. Or in the morning <br/>
she&#39;ll say &quot;Boun giorno&quot; instead of good morning. <br/>
<br/>
I hope some of this helps! <br/>
Learning another language is fun!<br/>

Congratulaions on the decision to take your kids out of school! I <br/>
took my three out, one at a time, over a 4 months period starting in <br/>
Dec. of 2004. <br/>

I took a look at your blog. Aren&#39;t they fun? :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-212602975">Hello! I just joined this list a few days ago. I have two daughters, ages 7 and 3. We are learning Japanese together and we found a great website for vocabulary in 11 different languages, including both German and Italian<br/>

<br/>
You just run your cursor over the pictures and there is both audio as well as text. It&#39;s been a great way for us to learn pronunciation, as I do not speak Japanese myself, we are all starting from the beginning. <br/>
<br/>
Babelfish is fine for single words, but you want to be careful using if for phrases, as it often results in gibberish. In fact, it can be a rather funny exercise to translate a phrase from say English to German, then back to English. <br/>

  &gt; Hi Joanne:<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; I saw your note on the unschooling basics list & was wondering how <br/>
  your daughter is teaching herself Italian? One of my boys wants to <br/>
  learn German (he just mentioned it a few days ago) and it would be <br/>
  good to find some resources for him... I&#39;d love some suggestions <br/>
  from you!<br/>
<br/>
  Hey Jessica :-)<br/>
<br/>
  I started telling my kids some simple words in Italian and <br/>
  Jacqueline (age 7) wanted to know more that I remembered. My <br/>
  grandparents (on both sides) were from Italy and I knew more when <br/>
  they were alive and it was spoken more. I bought two different <br/>
  Italian translation books (at a flea market for $1 each!) and she <br/>
  reads them often. Also, if there&#39;s a specific word or phrase she <br/>
  wants to know we look it up here:<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.freetranslation.com/">http://www.freetranslation.com/</a><br/>
  or<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/">http://babelfish.altavista.com/</a><br/>
  We also have a small chalk board in our kitchen and every week or <br/>
  so, I&#39;ll write another phrase on there and we all spend the week <br/>
  walking around saying it. LOL This week is &quot;Amo la mia famiglia&quot;, <br/>
  which means &quot;I love my family&quot;. :-)  <br/>
<br/>
  The words and phrases that she&#39;s teaching herself are ones that she <br/>
  uses in her daily life because she wants to be able to use it. So <br/>
  it&#39;s common for her to answer me in Italian when I ask something <br/>
  like &quot;Are you hungry?&quot;, she&#39;ll answer &quot;Si madre&quot;. Or in the morning <br/>
  she&#39;ll say &quot;Boun giorno&quot; instead of good morning. <br/>
<br/>
  I hope some of this helps! <br/>
  Learning another language is fun!<br/>

I forgot two more things...<br/>
<br/>
We also borrowed a video on the Italian language from the library <br/>
and one of the books that we bought came with a audio tape. <br/>

We also rented a few &quot;learn Italian&quot; DVD&#39;s from Blockbuster last <br/>

<br/>
They&#39;re not singling you out.  &lt;g&gt;   People who don&#39;t really know what to<br/>
say to kids ask about school.  Public school kids get it all the time. <br/>
&quot;What did you do in school today?&quot; or &quot;What did you learn in school<br/>
today?&quot; or &quot;What&#39;s your favorite subject?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Lots of adults, lots and lots of adults don&#39;t think about kids lives as<br/>
interesting or important.  What they know is kids go to school.  So, they<br/>
ask about school.<br/>
<br/>
One thing helped Dylan answer questions.   He took their queries about<br/>
school or learning or favorite subjects to mean &quot;What are you doing these<br/>
days?&quot; or &quot;What are you interested in these days?&quot;   Then he could<br/>
answer, &quot;trains, dinosaurs, kites, origami, swimming, karate,...&quot;  <br/>
whatever he was having fun with.    <br/>
<br/>
Many times a questioner would get excited about Dylan&#39;s interest and was<br/>
then able to converse like a real person.&lt;g&gt; <br/>
