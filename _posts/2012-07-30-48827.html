We have been deschooling for a while now.  You may or may not remember that I have six children, ages 14 - 2, and that I have recently divorced my alcoholic husband.

It&#39;s minimal...but it still requires us to get certain things done each day.

<br/>
What kind of custody arrangement do you have with your ex?<br/>
<br/>
What kind of plan is he demanding? Did he specifically stipulate that this plan must include daily written assignments? Are you at risk of losing custody if he rejects a plan that suits the needs and learning styles of your kids, which might not include any tangible proof of &quot;schooling&quot; (i.e., written work)?<br/>
<br/>
Unless he is specifically checking that written assignments have been completed, as public school teachers do, and has a judge backing up this sort of demand, learning does not have to look like school at all, and does not have to follow a schedule that conflicts with the kids&#39; own natural schedules. Learning happens through conversations, games, going places, collecting things, exploring nature, watching TV and other electronic media, reading and being read to, listening to and playing music, cooking and gardening and helping around the house, and pretty much everything the kids do. Everything the kids learn can be put into school-ish categories, if you must.<br/>
<br/>
If you can make some notes about what your kids have done each day or week, you will probably be able to retroactively list their activities in school-subject categories. Keeping a journal of what they have done and what kinds of conversations you&#39;ve had with them should be enough to show that you&#39;re following some kind of educational plan. It&#39;s usually just a matter of being mindful of little things that might otherwise have gone unnoticed (like when one of the children asks how to spell a word or what a word means, or notices a bird outside and you tell him what kind of bird it is, or showing the kids state quarters and collecting them in a folder with a map of the U.S., or playing with a talking globe or puzzle-map or magnets, or putting together a model of a dinosaur skeleton, or you and the kids catching a news headline together, or measuring with fractions to follow a recipe ... etc).<br/>
Photos of the kids doing &quot;educational&quot; things (like visiting a museum, going to the library, reading or being read to, spelling out words with alphabet magnets, watching science and nature shows, looking at a bug through a magnifying glass, etc) are also good for record-keeping and &quot;proof&quot; of their education. What you may have to &quot;prove&quot; to your ex-husband, for whatever reason, is not likely to exceed what you have to &quot;prove&quot; to the state, to comply with whatever homeschool laws your state may have. And in most states, journals and photo/video collections are usually enough for that.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I would think that he wouldn&#39;t need to know everything that goes on in your home, in terms of bedtimes or &quot;schoolwork&quot; or video game playing. You can run your household the way you see fit, and he can run his household the way he sees fit. You can allow the children to learn the things they choose to learn, in the ways that work for them, and he can drill them on trivia facts of his choice, as if they were preparing to be contestants on Jeopardy. You just need to let the kids know that their father&#39;s insistence that they must know a, b, or c does not invalidate the fact that they have learned x, y, or z on their own, in fun ways.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-472376260">I&#39;m sorry that things are going this way for you. <br/>
I have to say, growing up with an addicted father, that he sounds like he is playing the blame game again. That&#39;s what addicts do best, other than drink or _____. I don&#39;t have anything more to give, but to help you recognize that fact. Is he actively drinking? Can you carry on a conversation with him? It sounds like he is not coherent, though to you it stings because you feel there is an ounce of truth. Just guessing based on your remarks. I&#39;m sure you know, it can take a looong while for the constant barrage of blame to cease, and that only happens when they want it to. And at that, it is a constant up-hill battle. To me, and others on the list may differ, it sounds like while you may or may not be able to get him help, you should concider, if you haven&#39;t already, changing the way you let him control you. Certain things can be done to give you  some mental peace. There are some great books and sites out there. Al-Anon meetings. I&#39;m happy to email them to you directly if you don&#39;t know of them. Addictions tremendously and subtly effect everything that involves him in some way. With a divorce, it makes it even trickier...<br/>
This is a really hard place to navigate though. My heart goes out to you. I&#39;m sure you will get some excellent advice.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Had to LOL slightly at this Jeopardy reference for several reasons. I grew up watching Jeopardy (the original old school version with Art James - I think that was his name). So, when I got married, I&#39;d settle in to watch Jeopardy in the evenings. DH gradually got drawn into it, simply by being in the same room (ditto for crossword puzzles but that&#39;s a whole other topic lol). When he chose to start college, he took the whole lot of CLEP exams - and came out saying &quot;that was a lot like playing Jeopardy - especially the fine arts and history.&quot; Fast forward to now - I still like to watch Jeopardy when I can and now both DH and DS (who is now 14) watch along with me. Sometimes DS will ask me to not say the answer out loud until he has a chance first - and he&#39;s gradually getting some of the answers simply by watching more Jeopardy (and discussing interesting answers and categories). And sometimes he&#39;s okay with me answering and then laughs at how I know some of the weirdest bits LOL<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; What kind of plan is he demanding?&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He wants an outline showing that we will be doing structured daily work and moving towards the goal of having them prepared for college.  He feels they should be on &#39;grade level&#39; and that we should follow the public school&#39;s scope and sequence.<br/>
<br/>
This is after he has NEVER had any interest or part in their education for the last nine years of homeschooling.  He is all about power and being in control and I think this is just a part of that.<br/>
<br/>
No, I do not believe I am in any danger of losing custody, however I feel like I should try to compromise since he is still their father.<br/>
<br/>
The plan I came up with was very loose.  The two older boys were to be doing an online math program (Monarch) at their levels, whatever those may be.  I do not plan on pushing them to &#39;catch up&#39; or anything like that.  Just doing a lesson a day to appease their dad, which should only take 15-30 minutes tops.<br/>
<br/>
For Science/History I was planning on us all to sit down together in the living room, snuggle-style, and let the kids pick a topic out of the Kingfisher Science or Kingfisher History Encyclopedias.  Just reading on that for five minutes or so.<br/>
<br/>
For Writing/Spelling/Handwriting, I had purchased an inexpensive simple workbook for each.  I thought I would have them spend no more than 15 minutes a day practicing in those or maybe copying a sentence from a favorite book or magazine.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s about it, other than practicing their names, phone number, etc, since that&#39;s what they are quizzed on most by family and my ex.<br/>
<br/>
Trying to keep it low pressure and still give them lots of time for themselves and their interests!!!<br/>
<br/>
He wasn&#39;t happy with this plan because he said it was too &quot;vague.&quot;  But I stood my ground on it being enough.  I do plan to keep a daily log of our happenings, just as I would for the state, so IF any trouble comes up, I will have the records I need.<br/>
<br/>
But even this little bit has me stressed out just thinking about it, and I&#39;m feeling like I have to get &quot;order&quot; in the house by going back to bedtimes, etc., so we can make sure to get this done every day.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s so much on my plate...being a single homeschooling mom of six, working a part-time job, and trying to start my own business, too.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it is really more about me being organized and structured, not them.  ???<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1734459137">I think that, while it&#39;s wonderful to NOT to be answerable the state, it *can* be very helpful (especially with divorce or difficult grandparents) when you do have to keep track of a child&#39;s learning.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In SC we have to document &quot;subjects covered and activities engaged in.&quot; While NOT having to is great, when you DO have to, you really get to see what&#39;s happening and can share it. I think it&#39;s a great idea too for new-to-unschoolers who think the kids aren&#39;t learning anything.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In SC you can choose to use a daytimer, a teacher&#39;s logbook, the free download &quot;Homeschool Tracker,&#39; or even a blog to document. If I had a spouse or concerned grandparents I wanted to share with, I&#39;d use a blog---and I often suggest that SC homeschoolers use a blog as their documentation. Just write down daily/weekly what&#39;s being learned, where you go, what you do, conversations you have, people you meet. If a child writes a poem, include it. Photos are wonderful. &quot;Field trips.&quot; Living histories, science centers, museums, zoos. Kitchen experiments, baking/cooking. Just Document It. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If it would make an ex-spouse feel better, use some educationese to explain what&#39;s happening already.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You could also give him a curriculum: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum">http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum</a>   Just insert *your* child&#39;s name and revise the locations/activities to suit your area/life. It can also give you some ideas for a rainy day.<br/>
