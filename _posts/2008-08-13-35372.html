<div id="ygrps-yiv-1218341649">hi all,<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;ll give a brief intro since i&#39;ve mostly been lurking here. :) my<br/>
husband and i have been very academically (meaning we&#39;re nerds and<br/>
very into research) discussing and reading about educational<br/>
alternatives for many years, and about ten years ago decided that<br/>
unschooling was definitely they way to go for us. it took us a few<br/>
more years to get around to having these kids we were planning to<br/>
unschool, but now we&#39;re there. our daughter is now 3.5, our son 1.5.<br/>
<br/>
my question is this: my husband and i haven&#39;t really watched tv since<br/>
we left home for college in 1993... we now have a tv but live rurally<br/>
and would have to get a satellite dish and who knows what all<br/>
(honestly, we really haven&#39;t looked into it due to lack of interest).<br/>
we have a netflix account with a separate queue for the kids and quite<br/>
a large library of movies they have free access to. plus, we have<br/>
relatively high speed internet access and can find all kinds of things<br/>
that interest them online. i always assumed we&#39;d look into tv if/when<br/>
the kids expressed an interest. lately i&#39;ve been wondering if we&#39;re<br/>
setting ourselves up for a deschooling tv sort of experience when/if<br/>
they do decide they want tv or if it is unlikely to turn out that way<br/>
if we do what we can to support their interest in that direction as<br/>
soon as they express it. have any of you veterans had a similar<br/>
experience, or just seasoned thoughts to share? :)<br/>
<br/>
also, there have been lots of posts looking for start-up books for new<br/>
unschoolers, and i haven&#39;t seen anyone post the book that got us<br/>
hooked on this concept (although it took us quite a while longer to<br/>
discover that the name for this lifestyle is unschooling): Child&#39;s<br/>
Work by Nancy Wallace.<br/>
<br/>
thanks for all the list wisdom... it definitely helps me get back to<br/>
the right mindset when i&#39;m feeling grumpy and over-run by the<br/>
chitlins!<br/>
<br/>
all the best,<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t have experience but just extrapolating logically ... it&#39;s  <br/>
deprivation of needs that causes humans to crave something not merely  <br/>
the lack of it. We&#39;ve probably only had 2 avocados in the house since  <br/>
my daughter was born 17 years ago and bringing in another won&#39;t cause  <br/>
an eating frenzy ;-) If, on the other hand, my daughter had never had  <br/>
chocolate, baking a pan of Ghirardelli brownies might cause of frenzy  <br/>
if she was a chocolate lover and didn&#39;t know it! The frenzy would be  <br/>
way less if she&#39;d had chocolate and chocolate cake and chocolate  <br/>
cookies throughout her life.<br/>
<br/>
One of the big draws of TV is that immediate access to a wealth of  <br/>
stories and its window on the world for kids who are visually  <br/>
oriented. That aspect is lessened by free access to the internet and  <br/>
your stream of videos. So a TV added wouldn&#39;t be a huge change.<br/>
<br/>
I think the parents who are setting themselves up for potential  <br/>
problems are the ones with an aversion to TV, either fear or  <br/>
superiority. That attitude can&#39;t be hidden from the kids no matter  <br/>
how well the parents think they&#39;re doing it and it creates a barrier  <br/>
between kids and TV. So even if the parents say they&#39;ll get one if  <br/>
the kids ever want it (or worse they&#39;ll talk about it :-/) the kids  <br/>
have the potential of feeling there&#39;s something wrong with them for  <br/>
wanting something their parents have an aversion to.<br/>
<br/>
Even though we had cable early I don&#39;t think my daughter deliberately  <br/>
chose programs on TV until 6 or maybe later. Before that was plenty  <br/>
of videos from the library.<br/>
<br/>
I think the unique things TV offers are ongoing series with favorite  <br/>
characters (or that one show that sucks them in like Pokemon was for  <br/>
my daughter), a wealth of non-fiction shows particularly on the cable  <br/>
channels that appeal to even esoteric tastes, a common interest with  <br/>
friends, and the opportunity to discuss advertising (which is much  <br/>
more attention grabbing on TV, I think, though no where near as  <br/>
powerful or influential as those who fear such things think ;-) None  <br/>
of those are likely to affect your kids until they&#39;re older.<br/>
<br/>
(This may be the first time the question&#39;s been asked in a way that  <br/>
didn&#39;t inadvertently send the message &quot;You must have TV to  <br/>
unschool!&quot; ;-) For some reason the message &quot;You need to let go of  <br/>
your aversion,&quot; gets misinterpreted as &quot;You need to get TV.&quot;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1200216586">We don&#39;t have cable either, have had cable, moved, and now don&#39;t, due to <br/>
choosing to spend the money on other things-  high speed internet access <br/>
and netflix.<br/>
<br/>
We do have the opportunity with these to watch series- not brand new <br/>
ones- you can get many series through Netflix. My son seems to be able <br/>
to watch almost any series he wants online, also- through sidereel and <br/>
other sites.  There are also a zillion ads on some of these sites that <br/>
play as part of the video- same ads as TV.  No one currently feels the <br/>
need for cable except during the Olympics or maybe March Madness- and <br/>
this is my husband and he really doesn&#39;t have much time for it as he is <br/>
self employed with a growing business- he can go to my brothers house <br/>
for that, too. I have heard the internet will replace other media soon- <br/>
I can see in our house that it pretty much has.<br/>
<br/>
If we found there was something on cable - some need- we couldn&#39;t find <br/>
through these other media we would shift things around so we could pay <br/>
for it. I would expect the kids would be pretty into it for awhile- like <br/>
they are when they find a new series on sidereel, or netflix, or get a <br/>
new game or a new musical instrument.<br/>

may come a time when they see an ad or a toy for a show they would<br/>

yeah, i actually felt kind of foolish after making the post because i<br/>
realized that we can&#39;t anticipate (and purchase ahead of time!) every<br/>
interest our children will ever have. besides, if we do make a<br/>
purchase and they spend some time enthralled in that (new paint set,<br/>
tv subscription, trampoline, whatever) to the exclusion of all else<br/>
then we should congratulate ourselves on money well spent. :)<br/>

<br/>
yep, no aversion here. i think reading all the posts re. tv/food/etc.<br/>
got me a little worked up and over-analytical about how well we&#39;re<br/>
doing this RU thing. book learning and fully embracing the theory is<br/>
one thing, but trying to live it with very young children is a whole<br/>
different kettle of fish. i find myself with this perfect world<br/>
fantasy about how RU looks with older (school-age) children and get<br/>
impatient. i feel like my kids are getting more fun and interesting<br/>
all the time and just think (!!!) how much fun we&#39;ll have together in<br/>
a few years. meanwhile i&#39;m trying very hard to enjoy every moment now<br/>
and not get upset when larkin exhibits those passionate three year old<br/>
emotions no matter how reasonable i&#39;m being. :)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; (This may be the first time the question&#39;s been asked in a way that<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t inadvertently send the message &quot;You must have TV to<br/>
&gt; unschool!&quot; ;-) For some reason the message &quot;You need to let go of<br/>
&gt; your aversion,&quot; gets misinterpreted as &quot;You need to get TV.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
glad i could avoid the usual newbie trap. aversion handled (well,<br/>
irrelevant, i guess). over-analytical paranoia still slightly<br/>
uncontrolled. :)<br/>

_to the essence of a candle_  was what we listened to over and over,<br/>
especially during the last month as dh and I tried to sleep on my<br/>
single layer futon in our studio apt in oakland ca on the other side<br/>
of the country from my family...plus she was three weeks &quot;late&quot;! it<br/>
was so wonderfully calming and soothing for all three of us to<br/>
meditate with, even if we didn&#39;t actually sleep we felt revived and<br/>
refreshed in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
it made it so easy to name the baby: she told us what her name was!<br/>
<br/>
we&#39;ve not known any other larkin irl but have heard of a few via the<br/>
media.<br/>
<br/>
anyhoo, enjoy the music.<br/>
