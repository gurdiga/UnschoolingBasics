<div id="ygrps-yiv-808865005">Greetings,<br/>
<br/>
I am with you all on no spanking.  It is how I have always chosen to parent.<br/>
My question as a new unschooler and new member to this group is is it okay<br/>
to put so much heat on a new unschooler that we turn her or him away?  I<br/>
remember Yolanda Hicks posting just the other day that she wanted to know<br/>
more about unschooling because she is new to all of this.  Now, she is gone.<br/>
I don&#39;t think that position of this group should be changed to keep people<br/>
in the group.  But, I know what it is like to be new to a concept and<br/>
genuinely put your feelings out only to feel attacked.  The other thing I<br/>
think is that maybe there is a cycle in feeling comfortable with certain<br/>
groups or concepts, such as unschooling.  For example, people like Yolanda<br/>
find groups like this.  They stay as long as they can before deciding to<br/>
leave because the discussions seem to be too foreign to them, but not<br/>
without something that they take away that will make a difference.  And<br/>
maybe in the future they will return when their style of unschooling is more<br/>
in alignment with what we believe here.  This cycle is a guess and partially<br/>
based on my own experience with a parenting approach that does not involve<br/>
rewards and punishment.<br/>
<br/>
I put this out because the deeper I get into hsing, the more I believe in it<br/>
and anyone who is interested I want to hopefully impart something to them<br/>
that will help them make the switch to this beautiful way for children to<br/>
learn.  I really see unschooling as child advocacy so I understand the<br/>
passion.  And most of you have unschooled way longer than I have so I am<br/>
sure that you understand better than I do that there will be those who just<br/>
won&#39;t be able to get down with radical unschooling.  I don&#39;t know if I am<br/>
making my point but I would like to hear what you have to say.<br/>
<br/>
Peace<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1281260984">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  But, I know what it is like to be new to a concept and<br/>
genuinely put your feelings out only to feel attacked. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I suspect that most of us have been there in the beginning. I know I have.<br/>
However, I think it is more accurate to say that we feel *defensive*, since<br/>
&quot;attacked&quot; refers to what the other person is being perceived as doing<br/>
rather than one&#39;s own feelings. It is perfectly possible to feel defensive<br/>
even in the absence of attack.<br/>
<br/>
Defensiveness can be great because it is a real clue that something needs<br/>
examining. I find I feel the most defensive when I am the most in the wrong.<br/>
When I most want to jump back and bite is when I try to take a deep breath<br/>
or two, and walk around the house muttering replies to myself, until I get<br/>
to what *my* real problem is. <br/>
<br/>
That being said this is a &quot;voluntary attendance&quot; list. There is no goon<br/>
squad chaining Yolanda or anyone else to the computer and withholding<br/>
sustenance from them until they have replied to any posts. If a person<br/>
continues to try to defend their position they are making their choice to do<br/>
so. <br/>
<br/>
You have heard of the mountain and Mohammed. Mohammed has to come to the<br/>
mountain. This list is like the mountain, Mohammed can come and go at will<br/>
and the mountain will still be here.<br/>
<br/>
In reality on a list like this, defending or seeking acceptance of a<br/>
practice in the face of such near unanimous disapprobation is commensurate<br/>
to recommending it. I don&#39;t know why people continue to do so when it is<br/>
clearly a futile endeavor.<br/>
<br/>
Some people think that spanking is compatible with RU - and they try to<br/>
explain all the reasons why they feel justified in it (or *want* to feel<br/>
justified), and all the special dispensations, and all the rules about it,<br/>
to the list as if we had never heard any of it before.<br/>
<br/>
We have. All of it. <br/>
<br/>
What is more important is that there are people who are still spanking who<br/>
have *not* heard the other side, who have not had the courage to stop, who<br/>
have not thought about or heard about any alternatives to spanking, who have<br/>
never really come across compelling reasons not to spank, even in the<br/>
sanctioned &quot;calm&quot; just-on-the-fat way (which btw still hurts like a<br/>
motherf*cker as I recall from my youth). <br/>
<br/>
These silent people are the ones who may be reached by the anti-spanking<br/>
discussion. Others have found over the years that each time it comes up, one<br/>
more parent lurking makes the personal commitment to their children&#39;s joy to<br/>
renounce spanking.<br/>
<br/>
That is a more valuable use of the list&#39;s time than any effort to support<br/>
people who insist on attempting to defend the indefensible. <br/>

<h4>Pamela Sorooshian</h4>
<p><small><time>11 Dec 2005, at  1:58pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-790976891">Last night, my 14 yo was talking online to a 15 yo friend in another  <br/>
state. He questions her, frequently, about her relationship with us  <br/>
(her parents) and he is very very sure of himself, sure of his  <br/>
opinions (at least comes across that way - the fact that he brings  <br/>
the topic up over and over makes me think that, inside, he isn&#39;t  <br/>
really as sure of himself as he appears). He is a &quot;good kid&quot; - he&#39;s  <br/>
polite, he&#39;s interesting, he talks to adults (although the kids say  <br/>
he acts &quot;different&quot; around adults), he seems to love his parents and  <br/>
his siblings, he has interests and passions, he seems to get along  <br/>
pretty well with other people, in general and seems overall really  <br/>
good-natured and easygoing.<br/>
<br/>
He is frequently &quot;grounded&quot; or has things &quot;taken away&quot; - by his  <br/>
father, primarily, for breaking family rules. He has been spanked,  <br/>
too, when younger. He STRONGLY favors the exact kind of upbringing he  <br/>
is experiencing. He tells Rosie that any child of his will most  <br/>
definitely be spanked and punished for disobeying rules and said that  <br/>
kids who aren&#39;t punished get spoiled and that he doesn&#39;t think  <br/>
children are parents are on the same &quot;level&quot; - that parents should  <br/>
act like parents and say &quot;no&quot; when they need to.  Rosie said to him,  <br/>
last night, &quot;So, do you think I&#39;m spoiled, because I&#39;ve never been  <br/>
punished and my parents don&#39;t really ever just say no?&quot; He didn&#39;t  <br/>
answer, really, but just came back with the question, &quot;If your  <br/>
parents ever just said &quot;no&quot; to something, would you listen?&quot; (She  <br/>
says he meant would she ignore them and do whatever it is anyway or  <br/>
would she abide by her parents&#39; wishes.) She told him, &quot;Yes, of  <br/>
course I would.&quot; His answer: &quot;Yeah, right.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She said, &quot;If they felt that strongly that they just straight out  <br/>
said, &quot;Absolutely not. No way. No discussion.&quot; then I&#39;d think there  <br/>
is some REALLY good reason and I&#39;d go along with their wishes. But  <br/>
they&#39;ve never done that, they always explain their reasons and we  <br/>
talk about things and decide together.&quot; He said, &quot;Kids don&#39;t know  <br/>
enough to decide everything for themselves.&quot; She said, &quot;I don&#39;t  <br/>
decide everything for myself. I decide WITH my parents.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This went on - and she got frustrated because it was clear that he  <br/>
simply couldn&#39;t CONCEIVE of the kind of relationship where kids and  <br/>
parents honestly try to work things out together. Here is this very  <br/>
nice kid with nice parents - but they see themselves as inevitably  <br/>
adversarial and, the part that saddens Rosie most, the teenager sees  <br/>
HIMSELF as needing external control through threat of punishment to  <br/>
keep himself from doing bad things. If his parents were not there to  <br/>
threaten punishment, he apparently thinks he would go wild and do all  <br/>
kinds of stuff that he shouldn&#39;t do.<br/>
<br/>
THAT is a foreign concept to Rosie.<br/>

<br/>
This is just the kind of damaged thinking that Alice Miller alludes to in<br/>
much of her writings. He sees himself as flawed instead of acknowledging<br/>
flaws on the part of his parents. He also has the perfect excuse to disavow<br/>
responsibility for any future wrongdoings. Some authority figure should have<br/>
stopped him.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe his fears are justified - maybe he longs for a chance to go wild and<br/>
be free for a minute until the world comes crashing down around him. I hope<br/>
no disaster befalls his parents leaving him to have to care for himself for<br/>
any length of time.<br/>
<br/>
Too much fear to have to live with. Poor guy.<br/>
<br/>
It is also a demonstration of the ineffectiveness of punishments as a<br/>
strategy for producing responsible, conscientious, trustworthy adults with a<br/>
flourishing internal compass.<br/>

with a lot of rules and punishments and he can&#39;t fathom how children could<br/>
be nice/good without them.  I&#39;ve tried to give him examples and explanations<br/>
but in order for him to accept that what I am telling him is true, he&#39;d have<br/>
to come to the realization that he was treated poorly for no reason at all.<br/>
That&#39;s a lot for a kid to bite off and chew.  I don&#39;t think I thought deeply<br/>
about these type of things until I was in my late twenties.  <br/>
