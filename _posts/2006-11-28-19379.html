***Heidi, I&#39;d agree with all of these observations; but the following<br/>
just doesn&#39;t quite sit with me.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It is a &gt; measurement of intelligence, which means<br/>
what?.............Absolutely &gt; nothing!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Like the descriptor &#39;highly sensitive&#39;, I believe the awareness of a<br/>
child&#39;s exceptional intelligence could help a parent to recognize the<br/>
 asynchronicity of their cognitive ability, perhaps from their<br/>
emotional ability. It all falls back to eliminating *expectations* of<br/>
others to be &quot;at a defined level&quot; of performace by age, I agree. But,<br/>
the awareness that my dh and ds are both highly sensitive provides<br/>
insight into their perceptions and reactions being significantly<br/>
different than my own. <br/>

<br/>
Yes, but to an aware, mindful parent, the intelligence level isn&#39;t<br/>
something to be measured. It doesn&#39;t change the fact that we see the<br/>
child for who he/she is right now and respond to their needs. The<br/>
unschooling philsophies are the same whether a child is &quot;highly<br/>
intelligent&quot; or not (and the term &quot;intelligent&quot; is so subjective<br/>
because there are SO many different kinds of intelligence<br/>
anyway)....therefore rendering the label &quot;gifted&quot; or &quot;intelligent&quot; as<br/>
fairly useless descriptors in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve met a real-life unschooling &quot;prodigy&quot;. A child and his mama<br/>
stayed with us for a while and we became friends. She even cared for<br/>
my children in my absence. This wee child that was all of two years of<br/>
age, chubby-cheeked, walking around in a diaper could read ANYTHING.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;d been reading since 16 months of age. Truly, fluently reading. He<br/>
could read my emails as I sat at the computer.....a bit jarring to say<br/>
the least. He could read the newspaper at my table. He appea&#92;red to be<br/>
a little toddler, yet he had this thirst for BIG ideas and knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
I love, love, love how his mama treated him. As a child that wanted<br/>
answers. She didn&#39;t label him, treat him as though he was anything but<br/>
her precious and much-loved child. She responded to his needs in each<br/>
moment and honored his journey. He didn&#39;t want to read storybooks when<br/>
she offered, so they read the encyclopedia and other reference books<br/>
together. <br/>
<br/>
He was simply himself. She helped him get what he needed in each<br/>
moment, provided him with the things he loved and that&#39;s it. Isn&#39;t<br/>
that what every unschooling parent strives to do? She didn&#39;t see him<br/>
as &quot;more intelligent&quot;, but as &quot;thirsty for knowledge of big ideas.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Understanding our child&#39;s unique make-up IS helpful. I&#39;ve read about<br/>
sensory integration issues and other descriptors in an effort to<br/>
understand some of Jalen&#39;s behaviors. Seeking understanding is one<br/>
thing, trying to define him as his behavior is a place I don&#39;t want to<br/>
visit. <br/>
<br/>
I think that in an unschooling household, the term &quot;intelligent&quot; is<br/>
fairly useless. &quot;sensitive&quot; is a whole different matter, it is<br/>
actually something you can define by how people respond to a variety<br/>
of stimulus...though even with &quot;sensitive&quot; it looks hugely different<br/>
from person to person.<br/>
<br/>
How do you quantify intelligence without a test? A test that really<br/>
means very little because it is testing certain KINDS of intelligence.<br/>
And if you can&#39;t quantify it, does it matter? The label &quot;intelligent&quot;<br/>
is useless to me.<br/>
<br/>
I prefer to seek understanding with descriptors that are less vague<br/>
and hazy.<br/>

 </span></blockquote> Not only are the tests testing certain KINDS of intelligence but also<br/>
how well you preform in that particular environment - which has<br/>
nothing to do with whether or not you obtain the knowledge for which<br/>
they are seeking!  I suck at multiple choice tests, but I excel at<br/>
written tests.<br/>
<br/>
And what exactly is intelligence?  Do I think that my children are<br/>
&quot;intelligent&quot;  sure, but I also realize that it may be a bit of<br/>
mother&#39;s bias :)  I hear them talking about things that I never would<br/>
have considered at their ages.  They have a world view that is vastly<br/>
different from my own when I was a child.  Their understanding of<br/>
mathematical concepts amazes me because it was something I never was<br/>
very good at when I was in school.  Their play is indepth and complex,<br/>
it goes beyond how I played as a child.  Perhaps I a childhood<br/>
illiterate :)<br/>
<br/>
There is a girl who bags groceries for me at the store.  She has<br/>
tirsomy 21 (Down&#39;s Syndrome).  She remembers that I like paper over<br/>
plastic even though I am there only once a week.  She is remarkable at<br/>
being able to pack bags efficiently and compactly yet not making them<br/>
too heavy.  She is very aware of who has had their breaks and who is<br/>
on break and who needs to take a break and what time they came in so<br/>
they need a break at such-n-such time.  Stuff I never keep track of at<br/>
my own job!  I think she is simply remarkable because she is so good<br/>
at things that I can&#39;t do well.  I hear the other baggers (who also<br/>
collect shopping carts) talking about how &quot;stooooopid&quot; she is all the<br/>
time.  My only thought when I hear that is, &quot;Right.  And you are<br/>
bagging groceries because all the rocket scientist jobs are taken up.&quot;<br/>
 Here is a young lady who has a unique talent and is happy in her job.<br/>
 She remembers people&#39;s names and that I have three children and when<br/>
I go in without Dan she asks how he is doing.  Not quite what I would<br/>
call &quot;stoooopid&quot;  Is she intelligent?  Who knows.  Maybe it&#39;s me that<br/>
isn&#39;t intelligent because I SUCK at bagging groceries and can&#39;t<br/>
remember when *I* last had a break let alone my co-workers.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I prefer to seek understanding with descriptors that are less vague<br/>
&gt; and hazy.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which makes me question why we even need to qualify intelligence to<br/>
begin with.  It truly doesn&#39;t equate to anything.  I&#39;ve met people<br/>
with very high IQ levels yet they can&#39;t remember to look both ways<br/>
before crossing the street and forget to balance their checkbooks so<br/>
are always one paycheck away from bancruptcy.  And I&#39;ve met people<br/>
with very low IQ&#39;s who have such a wonderful understanding of people<br/>
and nature that I love to be around them just because of their<br/>
outlooks on life.  We all have our unique talents and gifts.  Some of<br/>
it is academic, some is artistic, some is philosophical, some is<br/>
rational, some is athletic, some is empathic, etc etc etc.<br/>

nothing!&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s only a measurement of one type of intelligence.  It&#39;s a limited<br/>
view of intelligence.  There&#39;s a book out now that discusses this.  I can&#39;t<br/>
think of the name of it, something about there being 5 types of intelligence<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-45039558">I was one of those kids identified as &quot;gifted&quot; back in 5th grade or<br/>
so.  I know that being shuffled into this category got me access to<br/>
more educational opportunities in school that made it more interesting<br/>
(eg programs, field trips etc etc etc that only the &quot;gifted&quot; classes<br/>
were offered/got to do).  For that, I will always be grateful.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand...<br/>
<br/>
Between that and my IQ scores, I was also hounded many times over the<br/>
years for &quot;not living up to my &#39;potential&#39; &quot;.  Barf.  <br/>
<br/>
What that really meant is that I hated school and wasn&#39;t &quot;motivated&quot;<br/>
to get A&#39;s all the time - even though I supposedly &quot;could, if I wanted<br/>
to&quot; etc etc etc.  I had a great penchant for getting low b&#39;s and<br/>
occasional c&#39;s on my midterm grades (the ones that didn&#39;t &quot;count&quot;),<br/>
and then managing to pull them up to high b&#39;s/low a&#39;s by the time we<br/>
got to the ones that &quot;counted&quot;.  I did better on the assignments that<br/>
I liked. Fancy that.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
It also meant that I was constantly comparing myself with the other<br/>
&quot;gifted&quot; kids and wondering why I wasn&#39;t doing as well academically as<br/>
they were.  I gave myself a lot of hell in general for wondering why I<br/>
didn&#39;t do better, given that everyone else seemed to agree that I<br/>
&quot;could&quot; do it because I was diagnosed as &quot;smart&quot; etc etc etc.<br/>
<br/>
I was also recruited for two different &quot;gifted&quot; magnet program in high<br/>
school (you couldn&#39;t even be considered for the program without a<br/>
certain minimum IQ score).  I was floored when a classmate of mine -<br/>
who I always considered extremely smart and much more articulate than<br/>
I - wasn&#39;t being considered for one of the two programs because his IQ<br/>
apparently was lower than mine and did not meet the minimum.  <br/>
<br/>
And speaking of the other kinds of &quot;gifted&quot; that they don&#39;t test for....<br/>
<br/>
I did end up attending one of the above-mentioned magnet programs and<br/>
continued to have academic issues.  In particular, the instructors<br/>
were trying to put us in these tight boxes that just didn&#39;t fit me (or<br/>
many of the other kids).  Some of the kids rebelled and just didn&#39;t<br/>
perform, others (with wickedly strict and academia-is-god minded<br/>
parents), simply went along with it anyway for fear of the wrath of<br/>
their parents.  I couldn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
So wanna know what I got busted for?<br/>
<br/>
Being a &quot;social butterfly&quot;.  Meaning I wasn&#39;t clique-ish and got along<br/>
with EVERYONE in the class as opposed to clinging with a few select<br/>
people and denigrating the rest.  Meaning that I cared about more in<br/>
life than just &quot;getting the grades&quot;.  Meaning the guy that I was sorta<br/>
kinda seeing at the time was in rebel mode and was screwing up with<br/>
his grades because he thought the system was bullshit too.  <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile.<br/>
<br/>
Mommy dearest (his, not mine), complained to the teacher that she<br/>
thought it was MY fault for &quot;distracting&quot; the poor lad and thereby<br/>
causing his declining grades.  The (male chauvanist) teacher  called<br/>
my mom and I into a parent teacher conference and I was reprimanded. <br/>
Made to sign a CONTRACT (or risk being kicked out of the program) that<br/>
stated (among other things) that I would not contact said poor<br/>
suffering lad outside of class until my homework for the evening was<br/>
done. <br/>
<br/>
So.<br/>
<br/>
Against the wall, said contract was signed.  A few weeks later, said<br/>
suffering lad told me he didn&#39;t want anything to do with me anymore<br/>
because I wasn&#39;t enough of a &quot;go-getter&quot;. He then proceeded to<br/>
actively harass and torment me (largely over academic issues - ie that<br/>
he was better/smarter than I) for the rest of my high school career. <br/>
A few weeks after that, I left the program (although I did finish out<br/>
High School at the same school).<br/>
<br/>
After high school, I went to a public college - UC Santa Barbara, got<br/>
ok grades, did a lot of fun stuff while staying drug-free and<br/>
responsible, stayed a &quot;social butterfly&quot; and was HAPPY.  He went to<br/>
Stanford (his mama determined which schools he would apply to - they<br/>
were all private/ivy league), remained an obnoxious ass, got hooked on<br/>
drugs and fried his brain.<br/>
<br/>
Hmm. &quot;Gifted&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
