Here&#39;s an excerpt:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;With the extinction of political history the educational oligarchy<br/>
has finally resolved the grand crisis of twentieth-century education:<br/>
how to prevent the masses from learning what is fit only for their<br/>
leaders. From the new textbooks, the children of the American republic<br/>
will never gain knowledge of, or the slightest incentive to<br/>
participate in, public affairs. Nor will they ever learn from their<br/>
sociologized texts how to detect &quot;ambition under all its shapes.&quot; What<br/>
the new textbooks teach on every page and with every passive verb is<br/>
that, for all practical purposes, there is no such human activity as<br/>
public affairs and no such human motive as political ambition. How can<br/>
there be when &#39;faceless social forces&#39; make our history and the high<br/>
and the mighty appear only as the victims of fate? No reader of these<br/>
degraded texts will ever learn from them how to &#39;judge for themselves<br/>
what will secure or endanger their freedom.&#39; The new textbooks have<br/>
snuffed out the very idea of human freedom, for that freedom at bottom<br/>
is precisely the human capacity for action that political history<br/>
records and that the textbooks are at such pains to conceal. In the<br/>
&#39;multiracial, multicultural&#39; America of the textbooks every citizen is<br/>
a tribesman and every tribesman the hapless subject of powers and<br/>
dominions he does not even know exist. Such is &quot;good citizenship&quot; in<br/>
the corrupted common schools of contemporary America.&quot;<br/>
