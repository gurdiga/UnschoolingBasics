<div id="ygrps-yiv-2090697758">I thought my husband understood unschooling now and<br/>
that we were cool, but my heart was broken today to<br/>
realize that he truly doesn&#39;t get it.  He came home<br/>
from lunch today and started grilling 11yo ds.  How&#39;s<br/>
your reading coming, done any science, what about<br/>
math?  I just wanted to cry and scream at the same<br/>
time.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess he understands not doing everything the school<br/>
does and that it is interest led but he still expects<br/>
subjects to be covered.  Deep down I felt like he<br/>
still didn&#39;t understand and today those feelings were<br/>
confirmed.  The last thing I wanted to do is argue<br/>
during lunch with him and I still don&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s such a great husband and father.  A few positives<br/>
have happened from me letting loose the reigns on him<br/>
and our marriage has been happier and he has been<br/>
easier on Zak in other areas.  I think he believes<br/>
that children need to do the subjects though, and I<br/>
don&#39;t think he&#39;ll budge.  <br/>
<br/>
It looks like it&#39;s back to relaxed/ecletic for awhile,<br/>
I don&#39;t know what else to do.  Boy, do I feel stupid<br/>
for offering my advice to others now, good think I<br/>
made clear that we were newbies to unschooling. <br/>
Unschooling is where my heart is at and having<br/>
experienced it and having received such wonderful and<br/>
wisdom filled advice has changed how I look at things<br/>
regardless of if we have to do a few &quot;schoolish&quot;<br/>
looking things.  Never again will I yell at my son we<br/>
he doesn&#39;t get it.  For history and such we&#39;ll just<br/>
keep it to reading, do fun experiments, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to write that with a smile but really, all<br/>
I feel like doing right now is balling my eyes out.<br/>

lunch? Stuff like &quot;oh let&#39;s not talk about that right now. how&#39;s <br/>
your day going dear?&quot; Or, &quot;oh we&#39;ve had a grand morning <br/>
discussing ....&quot; (real stuff, whatever you&#39;ve been doing) - provide <br/>
a little &#39;leading&#39; for your DS to bring up stuff you&#39;ve been doing, <br/>
but &#39;setting up&#39; DH to hear it in &#39;school terms&#39; even if that&#39;s not <br/>
what DS says. &quot;We had a great time this morning with science. Why <br/>
don&#39;t you (DS) tell your dad about what we found out about how <br/>
leaves change color while I finish geting lunch ready?&quot; DH is primed <br/>
to hear it with schoolish ears and DS can honestly discuss whatever <br/>
it was that held his interest for the morning.<br/>

<br/>
How about if you put your unschooling days into educationese for your husband? Lots of families have one partner that&#39;s on board with unschooliing quicker or more fully than the other. It doesn&#39;t mean you have to give up entirely.<br/>
<br/>
Did your husband insist that you go back to a more structured homeschooling? Couldn&#39;t you journal your days into subject areas for him?<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling DOES mean learning. And we DO cover the &quot;subjects.&quot; But it&#39;s not in the order school would do it or in the way they would have the kids prove it was covered.  Plus our lives swirl all of the subjects together for a more complete understanding. But you yourself have to Trust that the learning is happening. Then it becomes easy to share it with others.<br/>

You don&#39;t need to be! Just because your kids aren&#39;t fluent in educationese doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t be. Tell us some of your activities, we can help you sort it out.<br/>

<br/>
As wonderful as unschooling is, it won&#39;t be good for a child to  <br/>
unschool and have parents who are fighting and angry with each other  <br/>
over it.<br/>
<br/>
Not unschooling doesn&#39;t mean you have to go to workbooks and  <br/>
assignments and exams, etc.<br/>
<br/>
You can find ways to &quot;do the subjects&quot; in fun, creative, enjoyable ways.<br/>
<br/>
Make a list of things to learn about - insects, planets,  <br/>
multiplication, the westward movement, .....  whatever. You could get  <br/>
ideas from the &quot;What Every x Grader Should Know&quot; books, or &quot;Trust the  <br/>
Children&quot; by Anna Kealoha, etc. Pick things you think will be fun and  <br/>
interesting for your son.<br/>
<br/>
Then you can think of fun and creative and interesting and  <br/>
noncoercive ways to introduce those subjects. Maybe you have  <br/>
&quot;insects&quot; on your master list - you might go to the insect display at  <br/>
a museum, or watch a video, or get a praying mantis as a pet. When  <br/>
dad asks what you did for science, you&#39;ll have something specific to  <br/>
say.<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t unschooling - but it can feel a lot LIKE unschooling to  <br/>
your child if YOU are creative enough to use the things he is already  <br/>
interested in, to &quot;do the subjects.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
For example, if he&#39;s into skateboarding and you have &quot;measurements&quot;  <br/>
on your master list, then ask him if he wants to work on building a  <br/>
skateboard obstacle course or a ramp. You&#39;ll use measurements to do  <br/>
that - and you can make sure he knows how to use a ruler and tape  <br/>
measure, etc. (Amazing how few of my college students know what all  <br/>
the little marks on a ruler are, by the way.)<br/>
<br/>
It really isn&#39;t that hard to do this. Unschoolers don&#39;t do it because  <br/>
we don&#39;t have to - we &quot;know&quot; that it is unnecessary to make sure we  <br/>
&#39;cover subjects.&quot; We know that important stuff will get learned, that  <br/>
it doesn&#39;t matter when or how.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t sound like your husband is wanting formal assignments,  <br/>
textbooks, lesson plans, exams, and grades - so if you put a little  <br/>
effort into it, you can probably have a good time, not push your son  <br/>
to do anything he doesn&#39;t want to do, not enforce reading or math  <br/>
&quot;lessons&quot; of any kind, and probably slowly just drift into  <br/>
unschooling (meaning less conscious thought going into &quot;covering  <br/>
subjects&quot;) as your husband will &quot;get it&quot; more and more as he sees  <br/>
your son is learning and thriving.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-871070241">Thanks for the input everyone.  Although I truly do<br/>
not believe DH truly &quot;get&#39;s it&quot; afterall, it&#39;s not as<br/>
bad as I thought.  This morning I asked him, &quot;When you<br/>
have some spare time tonight could you please sit down<br/>
and read the journals that I&#39;ve been doing?  That way,<br/>
you can read through and see what we&#39;re doing and if<br/>
you have a problem with it, let me know and we&#39;ll talk<br/>
about it.  I love unschooling and I&#39;m not sure you<br/>
understand but when I let Brooke know that we have to<br/>
do some &quot;school&quot; things, she started crying.&quot;  He then<br/>
replied, &quot;Why did you tell her that?  All I did was<br/>
ask Zak how his reading, math and science were going?&quot;<br/>
 Then I said,&quot;But honey, some days he reads for hours<br/>
and sometimes he doesn&#39;t read at all...just like we<br/>
adults do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
About this time, he had to get off to work so the<br/>
conversation ended.  He doesn&#39;t want to read the<br/>
journal, yet I can tell that he still thinks<br/>
schoolish.  Again, his MAIN concern is for 11yo ds,<br/>
not 7yo dd.  DD inquires all the time, constantly does<br/>
math type things but does not like doing math<br/>
worksheets, she is active and always busy, even when<br/>
she&#39;s watching tv she is doing &quot;something&quot;, loves<br/>
animals, clouds, sunrises, etc.    <br/>
<br/>
As much as I am starting to see steps in unschooling,<br/>
I believe that DH is fearful.  When I was excited for<br/>
Zak that he had made a math game with shapes, DH saw<br/>
no big deal.  He sees that as simple, whereas ds used<br/>
to be doing heavy Abeka math.  It was a struggle and<br/>
there were tears but DH does not like this math at<br/>
all, he isn&#39;t seeing it helping an 11yo.  He does not<br/>
see math in dice, dot, paper math games...especially<br/>
with an 11 yo.  When he sees 7yo doing that and more,<br/>
he sees 11yo as behind and is very very concerned<br/>
about it.  We have that math literature form the guy<br/>
that can do numbers in his head real fast, dh doesn&#39;t<br/>
care whether or not we do math workbooks, but told ds<br/>
that he should learn one math trick a week from that<br/>
book.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tried to point out that DS needs to learn to love<br/>
learning because all he ever had was formal, and DH<br/>
says &quot;okay&quot; but then as time goes by and he doesn&#39;t<br/>
see things happening his fears about ds grow .  Dd and<br/>
I&#39;m sorry to &quot;compare&quot; but I am only doing this with<br/>
you guys here.  Her vocabulary is more extensive, she<br/>
is well-spoken, charismatic, she loves math, loves to<br/>
do art, asks for spellings of one or more words a day,<br/>
etc.  Ds, even though we&#39;ve had progress, seems behind<br/>
his sister and I know that this is causing the fear. <br/>
I do not know what comforting words to say to my dh. <br/>
Much of this probably has to do with the fact that<br/>
much is expected in our society from boys to get out,<br/>
get a job, have a family.  <br/>
<br/>
Has anyone here ever been in a situation where a<br/>
younger child &quot;seems&quot; brighter and more advanced than<br/>
an older sibling?  If so, was your spouse concerned<br/>
too?  Were you and/or spouse worried and were those<br/>
worry&#39;s put to rest?<br/>
<br/>
I HATE and LOATHE labels, but I used them here to show<br/>
what I believe is the fear DH has for DS. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance <br/>

Happy Learning,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1068868262">Sandy, let me tell you a story.<br/>
 <br/>
My partner, Beth, was totally supportive when we started to homeschool.  That <br/>
said, there were aspects of unschooling that she didn&#39;t entirely get.  <br/>
Periodically, she would get into some concern about Julian&#39;s not doing academic  <br/>
work. When we asked what exactly she thought he was missing out on, she said,  <br/>
&quot;oh, like making dioramas.&quot;  It kind of became a family joke, because we  all <br/>
knew damn well that she wasn&#39;t really concerned about dioramas.<br/>
 <br/>
One week at Sunday school, julian made a diorama based on a Farside cartoon  <br/>
he&#39;d seen, and solemnly presented it to Beth, who joked back, &quot;Now, was that <br/>
so  hard?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
These days, Beth, who works for a Girl Scout council, has been known to  <br/>
challenge school administrators and directors of youth organizations on how much  <br/>
respect and listening they do with kids. I suspect some of them quake in fear  <br/>
when she approaches.<br/>
 <br/>
What I&#39;m trying to tell you is that he doesn&#39;t have to totally get it yet.  <br/>
There will be times, as new unschoolers, where either of you will have panic  <br/>
attacks and those fears &quot;OHMYGOD! What am I doing to my child&#39;s life????&quot;   <br/>
It&#39;s best when only one parent is crazy at a time. But it&#39;s okay. Julian is 16  <br/>
now, and at a time when most traditional parents find they worry more, I worry  <br/>
very little about how he will turn out. (he&#39;s worked out very well,  <br/>
actually.)<br/>
 <br/>
Ask him to just come to you if he has concerns. It&#39;s clear that he trusts  <br/>
you, he&#39;s just very confused. Keep him in the loop. Brag about the cool things  <br/>
your kids know. Let him know that it&#39;s going to be hard for the kids to answer <br/>
 &quot;How is the math or science going?&quot; -- not because they aren&#39;t learning any, <br/>
but  because they don&#39;t separate it like that. YOU can tell him how the math <br/>
is  going, and your husband will learn to see it too. <br/>
 <br/>
From what you&#39;ve said, it sounds like it will be fine. I worry much more  <br/>
about the folks whose partners start making laws about what the kids have to  <br/>
learn, etc. That never seems good for the relationship or the kids. It doesn&#39;t  <br/>
sound like he&#39;s doing that, though.<br/>
 <br/>

&gt; missing out on, she said,  <br/>
&gt; &quot;oh, like making dioramas.&quot;  It kind of became a<br/>
&gt; family joke, because we  all <br/>
&gt; knew damn well that she wasn&#39;t really concerned<br/>
&gt; about dioramas.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; One week at Sunday school, julian made a diorama<br/>
&gt; based on a Farside cartoon  <br/>
&gt; he&#39;d seen, and solemnly presented it to Beth, who<br/>
&gt; joked back, &quot;Now, was that <br/>
&gt; so  hard?&quot;<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; These days, Beth, who works for a Girl Scout<br/>
&gt; council, has been known to  <br/>
&gt; challenge school administrators and directors of<br/>
&gt; youth organizations on how much  <br/>
&gt; respect and listening they do with kids. I suspect<br/>
&gt; some of them quake in fear  <br/>
&gt; when she approaches.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; What I&#39;m trying to tell you is that he doesn&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; to totally get it yet.  <br/>
&gt; There will be times, as new unschoolers, where<br/>
&gt; either of you will have panic  <br/>
&gt; attacks and those fears &quot;OHMYGOD! What am I doing to<br/>
&gt; my child&#39;s life????&quot;   <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s best when only one parent is crazy at a time.<br/>
&gt; But it&#39;s okay. Julian is 16  <br/>
&gt; now, and at a time when most traditional parents<br/>
&gt; find they worry more, I worry  <br/>
&gt; very little about how he will turn out. (he&#39;s worked<br/>
&gt; out very well,  <br/>
&gt; actually.)<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Ask him to just come to you if he has concerns. It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; clear that he trusts  <br/>
&gt; you, he&#39;s just very confused. Keep him in the loop.<br/>
&gt; Brag about the cool things  <br/>
&gt; your kids know. Let him know that it&#39;s going to be<br/>
&gt; hard for the kids to answer <br/>
&gt;  &quot;How is the math or science going?&quot; -- not because<br/>
&gt; they aren&#39;t learning any, <br/>
&gt; but  because they don&#39;t separate it like that. YOU<br/>
&gt; can tell him how the math <br/>
&gt; is  going, and your husband will learn to see it<br/>
&gt; too. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; From what you&#39;ve said, it sounds like it will be<br/>
&gt; fine. I worry much more  <br/>
&gt; about the folks whose partners start making laws<br/>
&gt; about what the kids have to  <br/>
&gt; learn, etc. That never seems good for the<br/>
&gt; relationship or the kids. It doesn&#39;t  <br/>
&gt; sound like he&#39;s doing that, though.<br/>

&gt; Thanks  for the input everyone.  Although I truly do<br/>
&gt; not believe DH truly  &quot;get&#39;s it&quot; afterall, it&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; as<br/>
&gt; bad as I thought.  This morning I  asked him, &quot;When<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; have some spare time tonight could you please sit <br/>
&gt; down<br/>
&gt; and read the journals that I&#39;ve been doing?  That<br/>
&gt; way,<br/>
&gt; you can  read through and see what we&#39;re doing and<br/>
&gt; if<br/>
&gt; you have a problem with it,  let me know and we&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; talk<br/>
&gt; about it.  I love unschooling and I&#39;m not  sure you<br/>
&gt; understand but when I let Brooke know that we have<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; do some  &quot;school&quot; things, she started crying.&quot;  He<br/>
&gt; then<br/>
&gt; replied, &quot;Why did you  tell her that?  All I did was<br/>
&gt; ask Zak how his reading, math and  science were<br/>
&gt; going?&quot;<br/>
&gt; Then I said,&quot;But honey, some days he reads for <br/>
&gt; hours<br/>
&gt; and sometimes he doesn&#39;t read at all...just like we<br/>
&gt; adults  do.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; About this time, he had to get off to work so the<br/>
&gt; conversation  ended.  He doesn&#39;t want to read the<br/>
&gt; journal, yet I can tell that he  still thinks<br/>
&gt; schoolish.  Again, his MAIN concern is for 11yo  ds,<br/>
&gt; not 7yo dd.  DD inquires all the time, constantly<br/>
&gt; does<br/>
&gt; math  type things but does not like doing math<br/>
&gt; worksheets, she is active and  always busy, even<br/>
&gt; when<br/>
&gt; she&#39;s watching tv she is doing &quot;something&quot;,  loves<br/>
&gt; animals, clouds, sunrises, etc.    <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As much as I am  starting to see steps in<br/>
&gt; unschooling,<br/>
&gt; I believe that DH is fearful.   When I was excited<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; Zak that he had made a math game with shapes, DH <br/>
&gt; saw<br/>
&gt; no big deal.  He sees that as simple, whereas ds<br/>
&gt; used<br/>
&gt; to be  doing heavy Abeka math.  It was a struggle<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; there were tears but DH  does not like this math at<br/>
&gt; all, he isn&#39;t seeing it helping an 11yo.   He does<br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; see math in dice, dot, paper math games...especially<br/>
&gt; with an  11 yo.  When he sees 7yo doing that and<br/>
&gt; more,<br/>
&gt; he sees 11yo as behind  and is very very concerned<br/>
&gt; about it.  We have that math literature  form the<br/>
&gt; guy<br/>
&gt; that can do numbers in his head real fast, dh<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; care  whether or not we do math workbooks, but told<br/>
&gt; ds<br/>
&gt; that he should learn one  math trick a week from<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; book.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve tried to point out that DS  needs to learn to<br/>
&gt; love<br/>
&gt; learning because all he ever had was formal, and  DH<br/>
&gt; says &quot;okay&quot; but then as time goes by and he doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; see things  happening his fears about ds grow .  Dd<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m sorry to &quot;compare&quot; but  I am only doing this<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; you guys here.  Her vocabulary is more  extensive,<br/>
&gt; she<br/>
&gt; is well-spoken, charismatic, she loves math, loves<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; do  art, asks for spellings of one or more words a<br/>
&gt; day,<br/>
&gt; etc.  Ds, even  though we&#39;ve had progress, seems<br/>
&gt; behind<br/>
&gt; his sister and I know that this is  causing the<br/>
&gt; fear. <br/>
&gt; I do not know what comforting words to say to my dh.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Much of this probably has to do with the fact that<br/>
&gt; much is expected in  our society from boys to get<br/>
&gt; out,<br/>
&gt; get a job, have a family.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Has anyone here ever been in a situation where a<br/>
&gt; younger child  &quot;seems&quot; brighter and more advanced<br/>
&gt; than<br/>
&gt; an older sibling?  If so, was  your spouse concerned<br/>
&gt; too?  Were you and/or spouse worried and were  those<br/>
&gt; worry&#39;s put to rest?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I HATE and LOATHE labels, but I used them  here to<br/>
&gt; show<br/>
&gt; what I believe is the fear DH has for DS. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks in  advance <br/>
&gt; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-139241722"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Kathryn, thank you....  That really helps a lot and by<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you letting me see that &quot;panic attacks&quot; are normal<br/>
makes me feel much more confident.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We all have panic attacks! Especially at the beginning. Here&#39;s a piece of an unschooling talk I gave once about this very thing:<br/>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
There were times, especially during that first year of unschooling that it seemed that at least once a month I was certain that unschooling was not the way for us. It was a failure. It was not working. Stuff was getting in the way. The kids were bored or I was cranky or the TV was bugging the heck out of me. That of course meant that they weren�t learning anything, they would never learn anything and this whole unschooling experiment was a BIG failure!!<br/>
<br/>
But it would pass, as cycles naturally do. And just as naturally my children would emerge with a newfound passion, a particularly insightful question or a great new interest to pursue. Suddenly unschooling was working again. Imagine that. And as I began to get a feel for this rhythm of our natural days and nights and weeks and months, I could see that it was NOT the unschooling that was the problem. It was any number of normal, natural life occurrences.<br/>
<br/>
So for awhile, I had a sign that I put up on my mirror that said �It�s NOT the unschooling, it�s ___________ and then I would fill in the blank. It�s not the unschooling, it�s P.M.S. (That was a big one, thus the once a month nature of my panic attacks.) or It�s not the unschooling, it�s flu season. Or it�s not the unschooling it�s time for the in-laws to visit. (Another biggie.) After I filled in enough different variations, I realized that I really needed only one sign to remind me what it�s all about. It�s not the unschooling, it�s LIFE.<br/>
<br/>
If you find yourself getting stressed and doubtful you might want to create your own sign, with your own understanding of what will fill in your stress blanks. Perhaps it�s a pregnancy, a nursing toddler or a fearful 7-year-old. These are all occurrences in the natural path of our life cycles. We can let them get in the way and use them as an excuse, or we can flow with them, around them and through them. Part of life is about accepting those things that just ARE. Things happen. But it doesn�t mean that our kids are suddenly unable to learn. It just means that life is happening. And when life happens, learning happens too.<br/>
<br/>
Once I was able to see this as True, I was able to more comfortably stay on this path even when it seemed to be turning in ways I didn�t expect, trusting that it was leading me to where my family needed to be. If one day or week or even month seemed to be caught in a lull of activity or groundswell of boredom, the next was just as likely to be bathed in activity and interest. <br/>

&quot;Just  because your kids aren&#39;t fluent in educationese doesn&#39;t mean you <br/>
can&#39;t be.  Tell us some of your activities, we can help you sort it <br/>
out.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Are  there any good resources anyone can recommend on this aspect of  <br/>
unschooling?  I try to journal, but find it difficult not always  <br/>
knowing &quot;how&quot; to record our lives in relation to education.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks  - Tina<br/>

That would be a great resource, since I have to do that for the school  <br/>
district here. This being my first year having to report though, it will be  easier <br/>
since they have nothing to go on from last year to &quot;compare&quot; him too.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I might suggest journal first, just write it out, what they did, <br/>
said, went, asked about, explored, etc. THEN after that&#39;s all <br/>
written down sort out the &#39;category&#39; for it. Maybe pick a day, write <br/>
it down then toss out an activity to the group here - we can likely <br/>
put our collective brains together and give you some ideas.<br/>
<br/>
For example: &quot;made blueberry muffins&quot;<br/>
okay, home ec is an obvious one. then there&#39;s nutrition potentially, <br/>
which leads to health. There&#39;s also reading (reading recipes is <br/>
reading, reading is not just books and magazines). And math <br/>
(measurement, time, fractions, possibly multiplying if you double <br/>
the recipe - like if you&#39;ve got LOTS of fresh blueberries to use). <br/>
Maybe even history if you&#39;re using Grandma Betsy&#39;s recipe and you <br/>
talk about family stories of when you were little and Grandma Betsy <br/>
told you about when they lived through the Depression and sometimes <br/>
blueberry muffins were it to eat since they had a big blueberry <br/>
patch so the blueberries were free, eggs came from their own <br/>
chickens, and flour was fairly inexpensive and they traded some eggs <br/>
for milk and honey from a neighbor. All sorts of stuff is possible. <br/>
Then there&#39;s science - why do they pouf up? what if you use more or <br/>
less baking powder/baking soda? why is it called double acting? what <br/>
makes a berry a berry? are tomatoes fruits or veggies? (some people <br/>
consider them berries I think so that fits the discussion). <br/>

Sandy, would your DH read something if you left it for him? I did this with  <br/>
my DH, because if we start discussing something not in his direct interest <br/>
(not  saying his children aren&#39;t in his interest), he tends to tune me out and do <br/>
the  &quot;yes dear&quot; bit. I simply avoided that with unschooling and printed out <br/>
some info  and stuck it on top of the reading pile in the bathroom, with a few <br/>
notes in the  margins from me. I knew that that was one spot where he&#39;d read <br/>
it. And he did.  And thankfully, agrees 100% and is on board the same boat as <br/>
me. And now, we DO  discuss it, because it is now sparked HIS interest. :o)  <br/>
