 </span></blockquote>Actually it still does.  Saying BUT lessens the meaning of the first part.<br/>
For instance in your first example, you are disqualifying/negating Ren&#39;s<br/>
disorganization by making up for the fact that she is creative.  the paper<br/>
is rough, but it is ok (negated) because it does what I need it to (I&#39;m<br/>
presuming some sort of art paper).  Green is too bright but (negate) if we<br/>
add yellow it won&#39;t be green anymore.  And Jalen doesn&#39;t love visiting you<br/>
as much as ice cream.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve taken quite a few human relations courses (thanks to LLL and rape<br/>
crisis counselling) and this is one thing we are taught over and over.  When<br/>
speaking with people try to find ways of not using the words but and<br/>
however.  For instance if someone says, &quot;Can you watch my kids on Friday&quot;<br/>
and you *really* don&#39;t want to (or can&#39;t) watch their kids don&#39;t say, &quot;I<br/>
would love to BUT I have something else to do.&quot; Simply say, &quot;That doesn&#39;t<br/>
work for me as I have something else to do that day.&quot;  I remember the first<br/>
time that I was severely chastized for using the word but when communicating<br/>
in a professional forum (Lactation mailing list) by someone that I greatly<br/>
admired.  It was the first time that I had ever heard that and I believe<br/>
that I did have a few examples like Ren&#39;s trying to prove my point and she<br/>
not so kindly pointed out how while I thought that they were not negating<br/>
the first half that they truly were.  &quot;But&quot; can lessen the importance of the<br/>
first half of a sentence.  If you wanted to show yourself in a positive<br/>
sense (using your disorganized example) you could much better express it by<br/>
saying, &quot;Ren manages to create truly amazing things through a chaordic<br/>
method!&quot; (Chaord is order out of chaos.)   &quot;While the paper is really rough,<br/>
it has the perfect absorbability for the project I am working on.&quot;  &quot;Adding<br/>
yellow to Kelly green is a great way of mellowing out the brightness.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Jalen is busy at the moment and has plans to go get ice cream.  Would you<br/>
like to join us (OR Perhaps we could see you when we get back OR Another day<br/>
would be better for us to visit.)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Of course it takes time to be able to work to a point of remembering to talk<br/>
that way.  And I tend to fail at it myself from time to time!  Sometimes,<br/>
though, the word but is a perfectly good word to use.<br/>

&gt; But doesn&#39;t negate anything in many cases.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, it does. For &quot;but&quot; to make sense in those sentences, it&#39;s  <br/>
assumed someone would draw a conclusion from the first part that the  <br/>
second isn&#39;t possible so the &quot;but&quot; negates that conclusion.<br/>
<br/>
The assumption of the first sentence is that disorganization gets in  <br/>
the way of creativity, so you&#39;re saying &quot;You might assume that since  <br/>
Ren&#39;s so disorganized that she can&#39;t possibly be creative, BUT you&#39;d  <br/>
be wrong.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In the second that rough paper doesn&#39;t absorb well, so you&#39;re saying  <br/>
&quot;You might assume because that paper is rough that it wouldn&#39;t grab  <br/>
color well BUT this particular paper does.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In the third it seems obvious that Jalen loves ice cream more than  <br/>
visiting but I&#39;m tired. So my tiredness following the but suggests  <br/>
that tomorrow morning when I&#39;m not tired I&#39;ll be able to explain that  <br/>
one better ;-)<br/>
<br/>
If there&#39;s no connection between the two aspects, then &quot;and&quot; is more  <br/>
appropriate. The two are just two disconnected qualities of some  <br/>
object: &quot;Ren is disorganized and artistic,&quot; &quot;The paper is rough and  <br/>
it grabs color well.&quot;<br/>
