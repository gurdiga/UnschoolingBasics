Aw, thanks, Ren.  Yes; I am fairly radical, especially for this part <br/>
of the country.  Lactating for 9 straight years, having more than 2 <br/>
children, being ultra liberal, gay, a feminist, sahm because I <br/>
*want* to, living with my ex, vegetarian, and a Disney lover on top <br/>
of that LOL!!  Today though I&#39;m having one of those &quot;I want to tie <br/>
my 6yo up with duct tape&quot; days.  <br/>
<br/>
Food is a big issue with Keon.  He has very little ability to &quot;self-<br/>
regulate&quot; this includes sleeping and eating.  We&#39;ve tried to let him <br/>
learn to self-regulate, but he just doesn&#39;t have the ability to.  <br/>
It&#39;s part of his &quot;autistic spectrum.&quot;  He truly is a child that <br/>
needs a bedtime because he doesn&#39;t have the ability to recognize <br/>
that he is tired and go to sleep.  He&#39;s up with the sun whether he <br/>
goes to bed at 8 pm or 1 am.  He is tired and I can recognize that <br/>
around 8 pm each night.  And he is usually asleep within 5 minutes <br/>
of going to bed.  Sleeping isn&#39;t a problem for him, it is allowing <br/>
himself to go to sleep.  He literally needs someone to tell <br/>
him &quot;it&#39;s ok to go to bed now.&quot;  Food has been the struggle lately.  <br/>
He&#39;s overweight and I know it.  To the point where finding clothes <br/>
to fit him is nearly impossible.  (he has this odd toddler-shaped <br/>
body - big belly, little butt with wide hips).  Clothes tend to be <br/>
either snug or very baggy (he also is this mysterious size that <br/>
doesn&#39;t exist).  We&#39;ve even tried &quot;husky&quot; sizes to no avail.  The <br/>
clothes are really a minor issue, it is the eating that concerns <br/>
me.  He will just eat and eat and eat.  He doesn&#39;t recognize when he <br/>
is full.  It isn&#39;t that the food will be taken away or limited, it&#39;s <br/>
that he just doesn&#39;t know how to regulate.  There has been a huge <br/>
argument in our house about food.  Keon tends to eat everything <br/>
almost indiscrimenantly.  He will just start eating.  He&#39;s almost <br/>
like a little PacMan gobbling up everything in sight.  It doesn&#39;t <br/>
matter what it is (except frozen peas)  he will eat it.  And he <br/>
doesn&#39;t stop eating even when he has made himself sick from eating.  <br/>
It just doesn&#39;t click.  The girls have been screaming at him this <br/>
morning because in a matter of 3 days (since I went shopping) he has <br/>
eaten all the chips, all the cheese, all the apples, all the nutty <br/>
bars, all the cereal, and an entire can of olives.  We essentially <br/>
are down to 2 eggs, bread, milk, and peanut butter aside from <br/>
dinnery foods.  So of course the girls are angry because, while they <br/>
can self-regulate and decide to or not to eat something, Keon <br/>
can&#39;t.  I&#39;m just at my wits&#39; ends to try to figure out a way to come <br/>
to a resolution here and help Keon have some control over his food.  <br/>
<br/>
He does tend to be better when he is busy.  He doesn&#39;t eat as much <br/>
when he is around friends, but food is still this huge issue when it <br/>
is around (Ren, remember the popcorn incident when we went <br/>
bowling).  Aside from locking the kitchen cabinets and hiding food <br/>
(which was what was done to me) I can&#39;t figure out a way to help <br/>
him.  <br/>

syndrome do not get the signal that they are full and need to stop <br/>
eating. Their bodies signal &quot;hungry&quot; no matter what to the point of <br/>
being physically ill - and then going right back to eating.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-714213143">Michelle, are you (or are you interested?) on being on the Shine with  <br/>
Unschooling List where we discuss unschooling life with non-typical kids ?   We <br/>
discuss these types of issues and share our &quot;shining&quot; moments of how are kids  are <br/>
excelling at being themselves!<br/>
 <br/>
When I had a similar problem with my kids eating ALL the cookies or ALL the  <br/>
candy, I went through a time of putting an appropriate amount in a ziplock bag <br/>
 and having that available instead of the whole bag.  It helped my kids  <br/>
adjust to a &quot;serving size&quot;.  Now, it isn&#39;t a problem.   But it  sounds like that <br/>
wouldn&#39;t work in your case, but maybe some sort of way to  portion and <br/>
distribute some of his food during the day to help his eyes &quot;see&quot;  how much to eat.  <br/>
Would he object to you keeping boxes of his food in a  special place, like one <br/>
for each time to eat?  the box could contain a  ziplock of chips, some cereal <br/>
and a nutty bar.  If he is still hungry, you  could discuss how hungry feels <br/>
while you are helping him with more food.   Maybe if you divided up all the <br/>
snack foods for all the children, he  wouldn&#39;t feel singled out.<br/>
 <br/>
Just some thoughts.  I feel like there is a way to do this without  being <br/>
controlling.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>OK, you&#39;ve given me an idea here.  Keon understands the concept <br/>
of &quot;what time it is.&quot;  He can read clocks and is fairly particular <br/>
about &quot;what time it is.&quot;  I&#39;m thinking of taking 3 or 4 boxes and <br/>
writing different times on them.  Each night before I go to bed I <br/>
can &quot;fill&quot; his boxes with serving sizes.  I&#39;ll just have to be aware <br/>
of when he is awake in the morning as he does like a cooked meal <br/>
(usually eggs).  We talk about the need for more protein and <br/>
sometimes he will tell me that he needs protein.  (Actually all my <br/>
kids tell me that from time to time.)  I&#39;m thinking he would <br/>
actually like having all these boxes and bags.  Things he could see <br/>
as some sort of order.  He could actually get fairly anal about it <br/>
LOL!  And maybe it would help.<br/>
<br/>
This past week we did put names on the everyone&#39;s nutty bars and <br/>
everyone&#39;s chips.  But that didn&#39;t stop Keon from taking chips out <br/>
of his sisters&#39; packages and put them in his own &lt;rolling eyes&gt;.   <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; controlling.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Exactly.  I know Keon will have challenges throughout his life that <br/>
are going to be unlike the &quot;normal&quot; challenges of life, but I don&#39;t <br/>
want food to be one of those challenges.  I had lots of food control <br/>
when I was growing up, to the point where I couldn&#39;t have fruit or <br/>
cheese without asking for it first.  I want my kids to have control <br/>
over food instead of the other way around.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Leslie in SC, whose son also needs to hear &quot;it&#39;s  bedtime&quot;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nice to hear.  BTW, Keon&#39;s bedtime is 8:02 pm.  (Don&#39;t ask me how he <br/>
came up with that time, but he won&#39;t go to bed before then!)<br/>
