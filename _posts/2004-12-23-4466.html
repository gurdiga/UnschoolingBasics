 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s helpful to see the advice given on unschooling lists as<br/>
*alternatives* to control for those parents who want to figure out how to<br/>
trust and respect their kids *and* help their kids with their problems.<br/>
<br/>
I think everyone can figure out how to take over control from a child! And<br/>
there are lots of lists where parents will share their methods of control.<br/>
<br/>
But if parents don&#39;t want to use control, they often don&#39;t know what else<br/>
they can do. There&#39;s a vast range of choices between controlling kids and<br/>
ignoring kids but there aren&#39;t many places those choices get discussed. (But<br/>
1000&#39;s of places where control of children gets discussed.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; there are certain things im going to do<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And there are certain things that someone who &quot;unschools except for math&quot;<br/>
will do differently than someone who &quot;unschools everything&quot;. But that won&#39;t<br/>
make their advice about math unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Pam Sorooshian said years ago that her kids had to go to religious services.<br/>
But she&#39;s never suggested that making kids go to services was unschooling<br/>
advice. And she&#39;s never suggested that, because of her religous beliefs,<br/>
advice that&#39;s not based on the unschooling philosophy was unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s okay to pick and choose. It&#39;s okay to adapt. It&#39;s okay to not extend<br/>
the unschooling philosophy into every aspect of your lives. But just because<br/>
an unschooler does something that doesn&#39;t automatically mean the action is<br/>
based on the unschooling philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; my son is allergic to milk, not<br/>
&gt; lactose, just milk in general when in liquid uncooked form. i have<br/>
&gt; to put restrictions on him because of his medical condition. he is<br/>
&gt; not even 2 yet and doesnt know about what im doing anyway.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I could call not letting my daughter play on the highway at 2 restricting<br/>
her. And I could call not letting her watch more than 1 hour of TV<br/>
restricting her.<br/>
<br/>
But the importance lies in their differences rather than their similarities.<br/>
<br/>
Getting run over by a car is a real danger with known unpleasant<br/>
consequences. Drinking milk for your son has known unpleasant consequences.<br/>
<br/>
We know our kids don&#39;t want those consequences -- I&#39;m sure your son wants<br/>
diarrhea less than you do! -- so we help them avoid the causes while they&#39;re<br/>
still too young to understand the connections between the cause and the<br/>
effect and too young to avoid the causes. So I wouldn&#39;t call not giving milk<br/>
to your son a restriction. I would call it helping him get what he wants:<br/>
being healthy and safe.<br/>
<br/>
But once he gets old enough to want the ice cream his cousin has, there are<br/>
more options than &quot;No,&quot; and &quot;Do whatever you want to because you know the<br/>
consequences.&quot; The area between the two that encompasses respect and trust<br/>
is where people on this list can help with ideas.<br/>
<br/>
*If* our goal is to trust and respect our kids -- which is the type of<br/>
advice offered on this list -- then helping kids get what they want is a<br/>
better path to that goal than restricting them from what we fear. All kids<br/>
want to be safe and healthy! But they want other things too. Our job is to<br/>
help them explore their options. Sometimes they&#39;ll have to set a goal at a<br/>
lower prioirty to get something else. (Like setting aside sleep needs in<br/>
order to experience staying up all night.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; when he&#39;s old enough to<br/>

&gt; handle the consequences, it&#39;s on him not me any longer.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think rather than letting go, a better option is always being there to<br/>
help and support them in what they&#39;re trying to achieve. There may be more<br/>
options he could explore than no milk for the rest of his life. If I were in<br/>
that position, I&#39;d love to have my mom there to help me explore my<br/>
alternatives.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; was younger*.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Bad eyes from too much screen time is not on the order of the certain danger<br/>
of getting hit by a Mack truck. And how to restrict kids in order to protect<br/>
them from feared danger is not the best topic of discussion on an<br/>
unschooling list.<br/>
<br/>
Discussing how to pass on information we strongly believe in -- and help<br/>
kids analyze information critically! -- while helping our kids get what they<br/>
want *is* a helpful topic for an unschooling list.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; so i do commend you for being MINDFUL of your child and his<br/>
&gt; health and setting up reasonable limitations until he is able to<br/>
&gt; fully comprehend the repercussions involved.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>While the rest of us are UNMINDFUL and let kids do whatever they want<br/>
without regard to whether they understand what will happen or not.<br/>
<br/>
No. There are more options than imposing limitations to protect them and<br/>
ignoring their problems. And those options get discussed here.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; my whole thing is that if everyone was intent on their<br/>
&gt; own stuff more and just tolerated that people have different views<br/>
&gt; on unschool, parenting, and life in general maybe debates like<br/>
&gt; these could be avoided on and off the computer.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This list was created because there were unschooling beginners who *wanted*<br/>
debates and discussion. The Unschooling-101 list blew up because there were<br/>
people who wanted to debate and people who wanted to just share what they<br/>
did.<br/>
<br/>
So it wouldn&#39;t be very helpful to figure out ways to avoid what people<br/>
created and joined the list in order to have! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I think the Unschooling-101 list has been renamed as HEM-NewHomeschoolers.<br/>
(Where the word homeschooling is being used synonymous with unschooling,<br/>
though the word unschooling isn&#39;t necessarily how it gets defined here. But<br/>
it might be closer to what you&#39;re looking for.)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
(I think I&#39;m wrong. Unschooling-101 may have been absorbed into the already<br/>
existing HEM-NewHomeschoolers. It had a big peak of posts at the same time<br/>
this list was created.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This implies that the rest of us that aren&#39;t advocating arbitrary <br/>
restrictions, are NOT mindful. Maybe you didn&#39;t mean to imply that, <br/>
but it sure comes through that way!<br/>
I&#39;m a pretty MINDFUL parent. I am constantly examining how we do <br/>
things and how I react and trying to adjust my behavior to be more <br/>
aware and more mindful.<br/>
I think putting arbitrary restrictions on a child, takes a lot less <br/>
creativity and mindfulness than sifting through many options and <br/>
trying to come up with a useful solution for all involved.<br/>
I would say that this list attracts some of the most mindful parents <br/>
out there. <br/>

&gt;&gt; handle the consequences, it&#39;s on him not me any longer.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not letting him do something now because it would be &quot;on me&quot; but if he <br/>
does it when he&#39;s older it is &quot;on him,&quot; is a nonproductive way of <br/>
thinking about it at all. Who cares who the blame falls on? WHY focus <br/>
on that? If he makes a mistake and there is a negative reaction you can <br/>
say, &quot;Your own choice - don&#39;t blame me?&quot; Wash your hands of it? That&#39;s <br/>
the feeling the above sentence gives. I&#39;ve heard this a million times - <br/>
in a million different contexts. &quot;I am in charge NOW, while the child <br/>
is young I will make decisions for him to protect him. I&#39;m responsible <br/>
for his well-being right now. But - when he&#39;s older then HE is in <br/>
charge and I&#39;m no longer responsible.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t have to be so cut-and-dried. It doesn&#39;t have to be <br/>
either/or. And this kind of thinking is dangerous - much better to <br/>
focus on developing a solution-oriented relationship-based approach to <br/>
life. I say it is dangerous because it is this approach that leads to <br/>
two things: (1) kids feeling restricted have the natural human urge to <br/>
push back and sometimes to be sneaky about that and (2) when &quot;freed&quot; <br/>
from the restrictions they often flounder and/or go too far in taking <br/>
advantage of their release.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of focusing on who is in control, better to focus on <br/>
maintaining solution-oriented and relationship-based attitudes - this <br/>
is what will carry kids (and us) forward with the ability to deal with <br/>
whatever life tosses at us - to have a good life NOW and in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Solution-oriented means that you are constantly asking yourselves - <br/>
what is the problem and how many solutions can we think of - which <br/>
solution do we want to try right now. This is a different attitude <br/>
than, &quot;The rule is you cannot have milk and I&#39;m in control of enforcing <br/>
that on you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Relationship-based means that, as you make decisions, you consciously <br/>
take into consideration the short and long-term impact on your <br/>
relationship that giving orders, imposing rules, taking control will <br/>
have - versus the effects that working together to come up with <br/>
solutions to very real problems would have, instead.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen it - parents who see themselves as &quot;taking charge&quot; for the <br/>
child&#39;s own sake, when he is young, are the same parents who keep on <br/>
trying to control their older kids, as well. They don&#39;t change their <br/>
way of relating to children - of seeing parent-child relationships as <br/>
one in charge versus the other. And that sets up parents and kids as <br/>
adversaries and that is truly dangerous because teenagers who see <br/>
parents as adversaries are far more at risk of engaging in all kinds of <br/>
behaviors with serious consequences.</div>
