<div id="ygrps-yiv-677784561">She needs some time to deschool. It won&#39;t happen over night, but it <br/>
will happen in her own time. My kids were in school for years, much <br/>
longer than your daughter and they&#39;re doing okay now. :-)<br/>
<br/>
How long has she ben out of school? <br/>

this situation? I keep a blog for this purpose - so the extended <br/>
family can see what the kids are up to and make *real* conversation. <br/>
Most of the time people ask That question b/c they just don&#39;t know <br/>
what else to say to a kid.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Are there specific things she would like to do? Sometimes Mo (5, never <br/>
schooled) likes to pretend to do school. When Ray first moved in and <br/>
was still in school she would sit with us while we did his homework <br/>
and bring a coloring or activity book and &quot;do homework&quot; along side. <br/>
<br/>
Part of the school propaganda is that school is where learning <br/>
happens, so it might reassure her if you occasionally talk about when <br/>
and how You have learned -or even better are learning- something, so <br/>
she has a better idea of how learning happens in the real world. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-117974896">Talk to her about what she learned in any given day. If she needs to see the <br/>
learning, help her the way you might help your partner if he/she were <br/>
reluctant to unschool. Show her how much knowledge she aquires from play and <br/>
from exploring the world. If you do it a few times she&#39;ll get the pattern.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1118290530">Hey Melynda<br/>
<br/>
Ya need some time is all. Time to let her mind adjust to the fact that <br/>
she can indeed make her own descions. Time to cuddle up on the couch <br/>
and watch some movies, start a hobby together. Do some things you guys <br/>
have wanted to do, but school got in the way. Take a deep breath and <br/>
rest assured that this too will pass. Also if you have an unschooling, <br/>
or even homeschooling, support group in your area use them. Go to the <br/>
functions and get her interacting with other kids that are doing it. <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-408461771"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Part of the school propaganda is that school is where learning <br/>
&gt; happens<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This really rang familiar with me so I had to share an experience.  <br/>
When Markus was 4 he would sit and &quot;read&quot; for hours on end...books <br/>
that had no pictures.  He started 1st grade (ps) at 6 and to my utter <br/>
dismay at the time, hadn&#39;t managed to learn his alphabet.  I was <br/>
worried (yes, don&#39;t mock me!) he would be behind the other kids.<br/>
<br/>
He ended up in Reading Recovery first week of Sept and by the end of <br/>
the month both his and the Reading Recovery teacher told me in <br/>
shocked tones that he&#39;d already mastered concepts most kids didn&#39;t <br/>
get until the spring of 1st grade.<br/>
<br/>
So...here&#39;s my own, now more educated, assessment:<br/>
<br/>
Markus always said, &quot;When I go to school I&#39;m going to learn how to <br/>
READ.&quot;  I believe what he meant was, &quot;When I go to school I&#39;m going <br/>
to learn how to read, and by God not until (because school is where <br/>
one learns to read, of course).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I also suspect Markus actually already knew how to read, but given <br/>
that I couldn&#39;t get him to reliably recite his alphabet, I never <br/>
really gave him the opportunity...so we&#39;ll never know for sure.<br/>
<br/>
Not that it matters.  My &quot;struggling reader&quot; read the entire <br/>
Chronicles of Narnia at 7 in under a month.<br/>
<br/>
And to think of all the things I could have been worrying about <br/>
besides his reading skills... ha!<br/>
<br/>
Robin<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Incidentally, reading was ALL he learned in 1st grade.  We spend <br/>
the last four months arguing every single morning about how he HAD to <br/>
go to school.  Ah...to do it again! :)</div>
