<div id="ygrps-yiv-811533151">Another new unschooler here, I&#39;ve been trying this with my 9 yo son <br/>
since leaving the PS system last March. Just had our first review with <br/>
the school system (we are in MD) where the requirements say you must <br/>
show &quot;clear evidence of instruction&quot; in Language Arts, Mathematics, <br/>
Science, Social Studies, Art/Music, PE and Health. Our reviewer wants <br/>
to see more &quot;written work&quot; from my son in Language Arts when we review <br/>
again in the Spring, and a &quot;written Project&quot; in Health. My question to <br/>
you, how do I provide these things to them while following an <br/>
unschooling philosophy. What if my son doesn&#39;t want to do a written <br/>
project in Health or keep a journal (reviewer&#39;s suggestion)?  Do I <br/>
just need to be creative about getting him to do these things....Any <br/>
suggestions welcomed.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Amy <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-428444895">I might first take a look at things he likes to do now - for <br/>
example, playing videogames. Then find places where that can have a <br/>
writing component. For example, writing a game review for Amazon or <br/>
writing an article and submitting it for publication on neopets <br/>
(apparently it&#39;s a pretty tough thing to get published there because <br/>
there are so many writing so don&#39;t worry about whether it actually <br/>
is published). Maybe suggest the two of you learn to blog rather <br/>
than a paper and pencil journal.<br/>
<br/>
And, while this is happening, check the LAWS of the state. If you <br/>
submit a one paragraph game review is that enough? is the reviewer <br/>
overstepping the bounds of the requirements? can you change <br/>
reviewers? Checking with others in your area might be more helpful <br/>
also - or see if there is a yahoo group for MD unschoolers (there <br/>
probably is). Also, it might be worthwhile to check with an umbrella <br/>
like Clonlara - at a quick glance it looks like if you&#39;ve got any <br/>
kind of &#39;correspondence program&#39; going on, the district simply <br/>
says &#39;is this student following your rules?&quot; they say Yes and life <br/>
goes on...and Clonlara is fine with unschooling from what I <br/>
understand (others can correct me if I&#39;m off base on this).<br/>
<br/>
I might simply sit down and discuss it - &quot;In order to keep living <br/>
our life the way we want to, we need to give &quot;them&quot; some paperwork. <br/>
This is what they want to see (written essay). How can we give them <br/>
that without being too big an interruption in the rest of our life?&quot; <br/>
He might be willing to simply sit down and write a quick report in <br/>
order to get it out of the way and done.<br/>
