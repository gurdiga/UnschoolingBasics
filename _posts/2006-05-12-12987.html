<div id="ygrps-yiv-1840766202">Sorry it&#39;s taken me a couple of days to reply.  I appreciate everyone&#39;s<br/>
advise, but I feel that I didn&#39;t emphasize the most important part enough.<br/>
The main problem is not her hitting during playgroups/dates, it&#39;s her<br/>
hitting her daddy.  For example, tonight at dinner she asked to sit on dh&#39;s<br/>
lap.  That was fine she sat there at a bite or two, then, smack, slapped him<br/>
right across the face for no apparent reason.  We asked her why she hit him,<br/>
if she was angry or upset about something, but she said she didn&#39;t know.<br/>
Again, I think this is caused by her feeling abandonment that her daddy has<br/>
to work.  The real kicker is that dh currently works fewer hours than anyone<br/>
I know.  He often leaves just before 9:00 and is home by 5:00.  Worse still<br/>
is that he&#39;s getting ready to change jobs and will have to start working<br/>
more hours for while.  How can I help her get over this, and what can I do<br/>
about the hitting?  Thank you for the book recommendations, dh is starting<br/>
&quot;How to Talk...&quot; hopefully we&#39;ll find some good tips.  I&#39;m also looking into<br/>
the other books mentioned.  I spoke about that this with my local<br/>
unschooling group at our park day yesterday.  One mother actually admitted<br/>
having a hitter, and said just to keep telling her that it&#39;s not ok, and be<br/>
patient, that is very hard when it&#39;s already been more than a year, and this<br/>
happens, on bad weeks, nearly everyday.<br/>
<br/>
My concerns about her hitting other children have more to do with the<br/>
&quot;bullying&quot; she seems to sometimes do and the fact that she continues to hurt<br/>
children after they have said stop or are crying.  That&#39;s why I feel like<br/>
it&#39;s malice.  Here&#39;s an example.  I sometimes teach sign language classes<br/>
out of my home to mothers with babies and toddlers.  Before this incident<br/>
Rachel just played during the classes, nursed, whatever she needed.  I might<br/>
add this happened last August, dd was about 20 months at the time.  Anyway<br/>
during class she singled out one particular baby who was about 9 months old<br/>
and kept acting a little aggressive towards him, hovering over him, taking<br/>
things from him.  Then a little later she threw a plastic bottle at him and<br/>
hit him in the head.  I of course told her we don&#39;t throw things at people<br/>
and explained how it had hurt him and how fragile babies are.  She nursed<br/>
and the mother walked up and down the foyer trying to comfort her baby.<br/>
After she nursed she got up found the bottle went over to the foyer and<br/>
tried again to throw it at the baby.  This is the kind of behavior I&#39;m<br/>
talking about.  Some might call it testing, it just seems spiteful to me.<br/>
The baby didn&#39;t have her toys or anything.  I have no idea why he was<br/>
singled out, he wasn&#39;t the only baby that age there.  Anyway, the incidents<br/>
betwn her and playmates have lessened and only seem to occur every few<br/>
weeks.  My main concern is that she hits her daddy nearly everyday,<br/>
especially if she&#39;s having a bad week.<br/>

&gt;I&#39;ve noticed that a many 2.5 year olds are not ready<br/>
&gt;to have friends. They prefer to play by themselves or<br/>
&gt;with older kids/adults. You might want to consider<br/>
&gt;dropping the playgroups for a while. <br/>
<br/>
DD does enjoy playing with other children and has a friend she&#39;s called her<br/>
best friend pretty much from the day they met.  I will never forget it they<br/>
were both about 20 mo. Neither really talking yet, but both had a sign vocab<br/>
of about 150-200 words.  Anyway we were at a playdate and I&#39;d gone to grab a<br/>
quick snack from the kitchen.  When I entered the room I saw 3 of the kids<br/>
playing side by side, the typical way for that age, but didn&#39;t see my dd.  A<br/>
little frantic I asked were she was.  The new mom pointed around the corner<br/>
and said the two of them had been playing there together (not just side by<br/>
side but actually interacting together) for the last several minutes.  They<br/>
stayed that way for quite a while.  This is the same friend she slapped BTW.<br/>
It just depends on her mood and the week/day.  <br/>
If I were to drop playgroups, I think I&#39;d go crazy. LOL<br/>
<br/>
&gt;It could still be a communication thing. It&#39;s not just<br/>
&gt;about knowing language. It involves knowing yourself<br/>
&gt;well enough to know what&#39;s bugging you and then<br/>
&gt;finding the words to describe that. I have trouble<br/>
&gt;with that at the ripe old age of 41.<br/>
<br/>
Good point thanks for the insite.<br/>

&gt;I think it would probably be very helpful for you to be very involved <br/>
&gt;or at least be very close by whenever she is with other kids.  That <br/>
&gt;way, you can see potential triggers and head them off with <br/>
&gt;distraction and other things before she gets to hitting.<br/>
<br/>
I do try and do this it&#39;s just not always easy to do before she hits.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Also, ask yourself is she could be hungry or have low blood sugar <br/>
&gt;when these things happen.  Sometimes a healthy snack is all a kid <br/>
&gt;needs to feel right.<br/>
<br/>
I also try to take this into consideration, but even if one of those is the<br/>
culprit I feel she needs to learn that it&#39;s never okay to hit.<br/>

I&#39;m not sure how to go about explaining/initiating this is it from the &quot;How<br/>
to Talk&quot; book?  If not can you explain it more.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I have recently read another book which has given me more<br/>
&gt;perspective and more specific tools for my OWN behavior. It is<br/>
&gt;written with the idea that we can&#39;t teach that which we do not know.<br/>
&gt;It is called &quot;Easy to Love, Difficult to Discipline&quot; by Becky Bailey.<br/>
<br/>
I think I definitely need to look into reading this one.  I know I have some<br/>
of my own anger management issues, passed down from my mom.  Thanks for all<br/>

<br/>
&gt;When a child is sent to the Comfort Corner the only rule is that you <br/>
&gt;don&#39;t talk about why they were sent when they are there, and they <br/>
&gt;may come out when they are ready to rejoin the family and be <br/>
&gt;cooperative.<br/>
<br/>
When I first started using TO&#39;s they were supposed to be a calming time for<br/>
her, then it happened that it just kind of became punitive.  What do you do<br/>
when they need time in a comfort chair but don&#39;t want to go?  How do you get<br/>
started with it, and can I start at this age?  Was this information from a<br/>
book?  How do I keep from making it become negative?<br/>
<br/>
&gt;For older children there may be a need for a tool called &quot;you hit, <br/>
&gt;you sit&quot;.  When children get aggressive and violent it&#39;s appropriate <br/>
&gt;to stop their bodies and give them a chance to get their brain back <br/>
&gt;in control.  If you have a Comfort Corner they can be sent there, or <br/>
&gt;even just sitting on the couch until they are ready to be calm in <br/>
&gt;their play and make amends. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see how this is different from a TO, it&#39;s just called a cool down,<br/>
again it makes me ask the same questions as above... what if they don&#39;t want<br/>
to cool down...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Mostly, GBD is about working to proactively prevent the situations <br/>
&gt;that would result in time outs.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;m just tired, but what does GBD stand for?<br/>

<br/>
&gt;Anyway, this probably won&#39;t be the total answer but maybe another <br/>
&gt;tool to help.  When my toddlers were violent for whatever reason to <br/>
&gt;another child I always comforted and paid A LOT of attention to that <br/>
&gt;other child very obviously in front of my toddler.  <br/>
<br/>
I actually tried this a few times, but it didn&#39;t seem to help.  I even tried<br/>
from Dr. Sears, when dd hits daddy, telling her that I don&#39;t like it when<br/>
she hits the man I love and not playing with her. </span></blockquote></div>

&gt; about the hitting?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First - your child will live up or down to your belief about her and,  <br/>
from what we can hear in your words, her greatest handicap is going  <br/>
to be you attributing adult motives to her, when she&#39;s really just a  <br/>
baby, still. I know others have said this, but maybe you&#39;re not  <br/>
really hearing, so I&#39;ll say it really clearly:<br/>
<br/>
You are going to CREATE malice and bullying and all kinds of other  <br/>
negative character in her, if you persist in thinking of her that  <br/>
way. You&#39;re totally wrong - she doesn&#39;t have ANY malice or bullying  <br/>
nature - no 2 year old does. This is probably the biggest mistake  <br/>
parents make - and you&#39;re making it in a big way. I hope you&#39;ll take  <br/>
this in the spirit intended - I hope that this will shake you up and  <br/>
that you&#39;re REALLY think hard about it and try on the possibility  <br/>
that this is true. Assume it IS true. Treat her as if it is true. See  <br/>
what happens.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Second - just don&#39;t allow the hitting. Keep her away from other kids  <br/>
for the next 6 months or so, then give it another little try and if  <br/>
she&#39;s still hitting, keep her away another 6 months. It will NOT hurt  <br/>
her to spend her time with adults and not other little kids. She&#39;s  <br/>
too young - she doesn&#39;t NEED other children around and she&#39;s TELLING  <br/>
you that, very clearly, by her actions. You are overstimulating her.  <br/>
Stop doing that to her and then blaming HER.<br/>
<br/>
If her husband it holding her and she hits him, he should immediately  <br/>
put her down and move away, no matter what they were doing. He  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t make her do stuff like hold her and brush her teeth. THAT  <br/>
is bullying. Nobody should ever use ANY kind of force on her OTHER  <br/>
than to stop her from hitting or otherwise hurting someone else or  <br/>
endangering herself.<br/>
<br/>
I bet that if you simply stop going out so much, don&#39;t have other  <br/>
kids over, and your husband doesn&#39;t &quot;handle&quot; her - constrain her,  <br/>
make her do things, etc., that she&#39;ll stop hitting within 6 months to  <br/>
a year.<br/>
<br/>
And, in the meantime, I bet you need to read &quot;The Hurried Child,&quot; by  <br/>
David Elkind, because I think you&#39;re expecting too much of her  <br/>
(meaning you think that she&#39;s more &#39;advanced&#39; in her thinking and  <br/>
emotions than she really is - probably because you&#39;re overly  <br/>
impressed with her verbal abilities) and that pattern will probably  <br/>
continue as she gets older and you&#39;ll continue to stress her out.  <br/>
Maybe if you read, &quot;The Hurried Child,&quot;it&#39;ll head off worse stress in  <br/>
the future, for her (and you).<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; a &quot;secret&quot; signal that lightens things up- I used to tickle <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Jacob&#39;s<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not sure how to go about explaining/initiating this is it from <br/>
 </span></blockquote>the &quot;How to Talk&quot; book?  If not can you explain it more.<br/>
<br/>
Really, the lightening the mood came about after reading &quot;How to <br/>
Talk...&quot; and &quot;Playful Parenting&quot; I think. What I noticed was that in <br/>
our playgroup, the punitive parents had skulky kids who still <br/>
exhibited the SAME behaviors they were trying to get rid of. I <br/>
thought, WHY be mean when it works NO better and makes everyone more <br/>
stressed. Mostly, I think it is about age and time, learning <br/>
actively how to be kind and gentle by example. <br/>
<br/>
As to the how... Well, you are bigger aren&#39;t you? JK :)<br/>
Scoop her up in a loving way. Twirl her around. Tickle her if she <br/>
enjoys it (mine used to ask) Turn it into a game and gently fold in <br/>
the &quot;rules&quot; of the game (letting her know that you understand she <br/>
needs attention, but could ask for it in a more helpful way). Look <br/>
her in the eye and tell her you are on the same team. You WANT to <br/>
help but aren&#39;t sure how. Get her doing something active. Perhaps <br/>
saying &quot;That&#39;s too rough around littler kids, do you want to go play <br/>
chase with me?&quot; &quot;Hide and Seek?&quot; &quot;Kick a ball?&quot; &quot;Dance?&quot; She might <br/>
need to move MORE before she gets to that point. Hand her some dough <br/>
to mold. Help her play with something where hitting or throwing are <br/>
totally appropriate...drums, soft sock throwing, etc. Redirect. If <br/>
she is stressed around the other kids, cuddle her as you move out of <br/>
eye sight of the others and help her. Every kid is different. I <br/>
agree though, that staying close and helping her feel good before <br/>
these behaviors crop up is the best thing to do. Does she have <br/>
warning signs? Can you help her be aware of them so she can back off <br/>
on her own?<br/>
<br/>
Also, fill her cup emotionally before you go, if you are still going <br/>
to. I noticed that when I was cleaning and cooking and such when <br/>
people came to my house, the kids behavior was not so great. I had <br/>
just pretty much ignored them for an hour or 2 while rushing around <br/>
offering excuses. When we went somewhere else, it was all about <br/>
getting dressed, rushing out the door, having food packed, I would <br/>
even go over things I did not want them to do. Yuck.<br/>
<br/>
Now- I put on great music and sing and get really zany and hold them <br/>
and tell them how great it is to be with them, that I enjoy their <br/>
company and being their mom. I try to focus on them FIRST. It works <br/>
great for us. And &quot;no&quot;, I don&#39;t do and say those things to be <br/>
manipulative, I do it because it&#39;s fun and I love being with my kids <br/>
even more when they are happy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt; I have recently read another book which has given me more<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; perspective and more specific tools for my OWN behavior. It is<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; written with the idea that we can&#39;t teach that which we do not <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;know. It is called &quot;Easy to Love, Difficult to Discipline&quot;     <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I think I definitely need to look into reading this one.  I know <br/>

&gt; &gt; the info.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Me too.<br/>
It really is about showing our kids how to control themselves by <br/>
learning how to control ourselves first. Focus on behaviors that you <br/>
see mirrored. My kids sometimes throw things. We usually say &quot;Hard <br/>
things are not for throwing&quot;. When I lose my temper, I sometimes <br/>
throw things, slam a book on the couter, kick a pillow, etc. That is <br/>
me having a tantrum and not controlling myself. I talk myself <br/>
through it out loud now. I try to recognize when I am getting <br/>
stressed and talk about what I need. Food. A few minutes to calm <br/>
down. Water. Fresh air. Deep breaths. A bath. And I don&#39;t hold them <br/>
more accountable than me. We talk about all of us working together <br/>
as a team because it feels good to help each other.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess I should have stated off the bat that I liked the part about <br/>
the mom, not necessarily the whole argument. <br/>
<br/>
Take her to play with things she does find comforting. If she sees <br/>
you trying to help her and doing fun things, she will probably want <br/>
to go. She will have your undivided attention while she recenters. <br/>
If she doesn&#39;t want to go, take her something. Encourage her. Hold <br/>
her if she wants you to.<br/>

I read &quot;How to Talk&quot; when my son was 2. I focused most of my energy <br/>
on having a reason and a redirect for EVERY action I didn&#39;t like.<br/>

I don&#39;t support this part of the post and should have stated that up <br/>

I think ALL kids and adults want to cool down, maybe just not as <br/>
fast as we would like :)<br/>
Ask her, not in the moment, what she wants you to do when she hits.<br/>
You might be surprised by what she says.<br/>

comfort from a child who is in obvious need of both.<br/>
<br/>
When I am stressed and have a tantrum, I feel horrible inside. All I <br/>
want is to feel good and loved again. When my husband is able to hug <br/>
me and let me know that it is just a &quot;mistake&quot;, that &quot;I&quot; am ok, it <br/>
makes me feel better and helps me want to try harder.<br/>
<br/>
I try to extend this help to my kids. It is hard to be whirling <br/>
around in too much emotion. Sometimes it needs to pour out, before <br/>
the calm comes.<br/>

This is VERY good advice. It&#39;s proactive instead of reactive. I used to have a similar situation when getting pictures taken of my kids. I&#39;d get them so stressed before the pictured trying to get them looking &quot;perfect&quot; and then bemoan how fussy they were during the photo session. Ahhh..lesson learned. Happy kids make for happy, relaxed and beautiful pictures. Happy kids and a relaxed mom make for better days.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL when DS was a tot, we had pictures done for the grandfolks <br/>
(since we were half a country away) - we&#39;d pick out whatever he was <br/>
currently most comfortable in, loved to wear most, and dress him in <br/>
that - none of those fussy, proper, mini-me suits or whatever. Lots <br/>
of happy pictures. Once he got to be about 2 and started resisting <br/>
the process, we just stopped the portraits and just made sure to <br/>
take at least a couple digital pix per year (lol). It&#39;s actually <br/>
pretty simple since every time we go to some lots-o-people big place <br/>
(Bronx Zoo, Amer Museum of Nat History, that sort of place) the <br/>
first picture on our digital camera is a picture of him next to the <br/>
Entrance sign or something - (a) it documents where we are (b) it is <br/>
an up to the minute current what is he wearing today picture should <br/>
he get misplaced in a crowd. Thankfully, we&#39;ve never needed to use <br/>
it for that but it makes me a little more relaxed.<br/>

We do this all the time for the &quot;documenting&quot; end of it, but I never even <br/>
thought of it for the other.  That is a great idea !   Especially since I <br/>
