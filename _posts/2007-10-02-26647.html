<div id="ygrps-yiv-1565466350">Hey, All! <br/>
 <br/>
Ya&#39;ll, I am comfortable for the most part with my children nursing, but  I&#39;ve <br/>
been really feeling uncomfortable (physically) lately. Julian is 5, Julia  is <br/>
2, they both want to nurse ALL the time (ok, it feels that way, lol) and I&#39;m  <br/>
feeling overwhelmed by it all. I really want to do child-lead weaning. But I  <br/>
want their time to be NOW, lol...well, Julian, mainly. Nursing him sometimes  <br/>
hurts, the latch is awkward I think at this age, he has ALWAYS been an other  <br/>
side twiddler which I&#39;ve ALWAYS gently redirected but he still does it (it&#39;s <br/>
not  always conscious, but sometimes it is for him). I don&#39;t know...I need a <br/>
few  things I think:<br/>
 <br/>
1. Please help support my decision to allow child lead weaning! I need the  <br/>
support to help continue what I know feels right for us. <br/>
 <br/>
2. Ideas of GENTLE weaning approaches - the kind that are more of a gentle  <br/>
redirection-see-what-happens-go-from-there kinda thing. <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s making me crazy at times. And at times, I&#39;m grateful we are continuing  <br/>
on this path. But this fits into RU so well, and I just know that someone here <br/>
 will be able to help...<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-828979165">I understand where you are at. Though I only have 1 child, she is four. We also believe in child-led weaning.  I don&#39;t really have any tips for gently weaning but I do have some tips I have found for my sanity:). <br/>
Most of the time, she knows that she can have &quot;nummies&quot; whenever. However, there are times when I am in a hurry that we have come up with &quot;hurry up nummies&quot;. It works great. Sometimes she asks me to count, sometimes she counts in her head or mumbles (quite cute), or sometimes it is just an approximate amount of time. Usually she HAS to have both sides but not always. <br/>
This has worked great for us in times that I truely am hurried and she truely needs me.<br/>
The other thing that you might want to think about is this. When I feel like dd is ALWAYS nursing, it is usually a few things that might be happening<br/>
1) I am getting sick and amazingly she knows this and instinctively nurses a TON.<br/>
2) I am more rushed than usually and she is telling me to slow down and spend some time with her.<br/>
3)She is feeling sick, tired, rushed, sad, etc etc.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing that could be happening for you (this is just a guess since I have an only child so far), is your daughter nursing more (maybe for one of the above reasons) and therefore your son wants to nurse more too? Or is he feeling neglected for some reason (I know 2 yr olds can take a lot of energy so maybe more time is going to your daughter right now?).<br/>
These are just all ideas. You son might just nurse a lot too. I know my daughter nurses a lot more than I thought she would. <br/>
I would also like to say congrats on not only extended bfing, but also tandem nursing. I know I like to hear it and feel like usually I hear the opposite! :) As stressful as I know it can feel, the time is passing quickly. Can you believe your son is 5? It feels like my dd was just turning 1! She is now a little past 4. It flies by.<br/>
Also I can&#39;t remember if I introduced myself, but my name is Jessica. I am loving this list and all of the conversations on it. Our dd is 4 (obviously) and we kind of lead ourselves to unschooling through child-led weaning actually. It just made sense. We are loving the unschooling life we have picked. It is amazing how awesome are kids are when we just let them blossom:).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if I answered your question Karen, but if you want to talk more you can e-mail me. <br/>

periodically.<br/>
<br/>
Have you communicated your discomfort with your 5yo? Five is still a <br/>
bit young for much empathy, but it *is* important to communicate <br/>
honestly with your kids about how you feel. Maybe you and he can <br/>
look for some solutions that meet his needs and yours together. <br/>
That&#39;s more likely to happen if you are talking with him openly and <br/>
not &quot;just&quot; redirecting, though. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1100628189">Hi Karen! <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Rachel and I also have an older nursling, Sophia who is 5 1/2. I<br/>
don&#39;t have any experience with tandem nursing since my other  dd is 16<br/>
but I do understand how uncomfortable nursing an older child can be at<br/>
times. I can imagine that if Sophia had to see a younger sibling nurse<br/>
she would ask for &quot;nummies&quot; much more than than she does now, usually<br/>
every few days.<br/>
<br/>
Joining an extended breastfeeding group helped me out when I felt<br/>
really done with nursing but Sophia wanted to continue. I don&#39;t have<br/>
the link anymore but it was a yahoo group. Also, your local La Leche<br/>
League could be very helpful since there are other moms with first<br/>
hand knowledge or at least great resource info for tandem/extended<br/>
nursing and LLL promotes gentle parenting. <br/>
<br/>
As for Sophia and I at this point I don&#39;t offer and don&#39;t refuse. I<br/>
did ask her the other day when she thought she would be done nursing,<br/>
she thought about it with a scrunched up face and said seriously &quot;When<br/>
I&#39;m 7.&quot; Hmmmm, looks like I have a few more years to go. lol<br/>
<br/>
Hope some of my rambling will be helpful. If it isn&#39;t, then at least<br/>
you know you are not alone. Good luck.<br/>
<br/>
Peace and Joy,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-484707191">I know you have lots of responses and I am very slow, I just had a baby and<br/>
I am not online much right now.<br/>
I just wanted to send out support vibes, I nursed both my older kids until<br/>
they were done. My first dd weaned herself but I needed to help out my ds.<br/>
He was still nursing at 4 and some odd months when I got pregnant again. I<br/>
had just assumed either he&#39;d wean while I was pregnant or we&#39;d tandem nurse.<br/>
I didn&#39;t realize how painful it would be for me! So I had to talk to him<br/>
about it after &quot;grinning and baring it&quot; for a couple weeks. I talk to him<br/>
about how I loved to nurse him and I knew that he loved &quot;boobie&quot; but that it<br/>
was physically hurting me and I felt like I couldn&#39;t do it anymore (at all,<br/>
not necessarily what your needs are). So we came up with a solution for<br/>
weaning. I would try and nurse him when he asked but if it hurt then he&#39;d<br/>
stop and we&#39;d try something else. He decided that back-rubs and cuddling<br/>
would work for him. So that is how we did it. It really didn&#39;t take long to<br/>
acclimate to the substitute. Also, he wanted to be reassured that I would<br/>
nurse him when the baby came. Well, he tried it, but had no idea how to<br/>
latch anymore. It had only been a couple months! But like you I had found<br/>
his latch becoming uncomfortable before I even got pregnant and had been<br/>
discussing weaning but not active prior to that. He was very lax about<br/>
positioning and it wasn&#39;t always comfortable. I would just ask him to<br/>
re-latch or stop if he couldn&#39;t get on the boob in a way that was mutually<br/>
comfortable.I admire persitant in nursing in our society, it is so<br/>
unsupported. So even if this doesn&#39;t help in any other way I hope that it<br/>
helps you feel more supported.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; see that as different from this.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wanted to address this in particular, because I don&#39;t see it so <br/>
much as limiting as finding a mutually acceptible solution to a <br/>
problem - and *that&#39;s* something that can carry over into tv, food, <br/>
games, etc. Sometimes, especially when parents still have some <br/>
deschooling to do, the &quot;solution&quot; involves a whole lot of mom <br/>
changing her perspective until the problem is no longer perceived as <br/>
such, but that&#39;s not to say there are never any problems in the <br/>
realms of tv or food or whathaveyou other than mom&#39;s perception ;)<br/>
<br/>
Okay, that&#39;s getting vague, so I&#39;ll throw out an example. One of the <br/>
topics that&#39;s sometimes discussed wrt tv is content that is <br/>
frightening to one or more members of the family. That&#39;s a problem <br/>
that needs to be worked out - but the &quot;solution&quot; isn&#39;t necessarily a <br/>
rule saying &quot;no tv&quot; or &quot;no scary tv&quot;. There are more mutually <br/>
satisfying solutions available. <br/>
<br/>
I think many people new to the concept of unschooling get stuck on <br/>
the idea of &quot;no limits&quot; (I did!). Personally, I found/find it more <br/>
helpful, when I come up with a &quot;limiting&quot; question, to try to think <br/>
about the situation from a different perspective - and often the <br/>
most helpful perspective for me is of improving communication within <br/>
my family. Oftentimes &quot;improving communication&quot; means *I* have to do <br/>
more watching and listening. I have a tendency to assume I know <br/>
what&#39;s wrong *and* know the Best Solution - after all I&#39;m the Mom! <br/>
Oops. <br/>

say &quot;could you play with this instead, the twiddling hurts me&quot; each time he<br/>
does it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I nursed through my last two pregnancies; during my second pregnancy I<br/>
didn&#39;t know much about nursing and thought one needed to wean.  She was 14<br/>
months but that seems so young now.  When my fourth child was born I tandem<br/>
nursed for almost two years.  The most challenging part in the beginning was<br/>
physically arranging me the kids during the night so both could nurse at the<br/>
same time.  The books I had didn&#39;t cover logistics to that extent.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As they are older and not newborns, it is completely reasonable that you<br/>
both/all should be satisfied with the relationship.  Others have given good<br/>
ideas for diversion.  When my son stopped nursing around 4, he went from<br/>
nursing to laying with his cheek on the breast, to falling asleep with his<br/>
hand on it, and gradually he stopped that (he would begin snuggle time<br/>
laying his hand on it for shorter and shorter periods as his need for that<br/>
comfort habit decreased).<br/>
<br/>
It does take courage to ask for help and even disclose that one is nursing<br/>
such an older child.  I made a comment about my current nursling at a local<br/>
homeschool group.  Most of them know I nurse until they self-wean and are<br/>
extended nursers themselves, but someone who must be new emailed me<br/>
anonymously (his/her name was &quot;rchybnker&quot; appropriately enough) and said I<br/>
was a pervert who was warping and abusing my child.  After that shock, it<br/>
has been nice to see the positive replies you&#39;ve received here.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, the nature of &quot;truth&quot; can be pretty subjective ;) Its totally <br/>
possible to describe all human relationships in terms of limits or <br/>
gains-vs-losses or positive -vs- negative reinforcement. There comes <br/>
a point, though, when thinking in those sorts of ways can hinder <br/>
unschooling. That can happen either by creating resistance (of <br/>
*course* everything is either a win or a loss, this unschooling <br/>
stuff is nonsense) or by leaving parents floundering trying to <br/>
figure out how to say &quot;yes&quot; to everything in the whole world all at <br/>
once. <br/>
<br/>
I made a concious effort, somewhere along the line, to &quot;catch&quot; <br/>
myself thinking in terms of limits or &quot;reinforcement&quot; (big sticking <br/>
point for me) and re-conceptualize. Is it necessary to do that to <br/>
unschool? Probably not - but it sure made it easier for me to trust <br/>
instead of panicking ;) In an sense it made it easier for me <br/>
to &#39;think like an unschooler&#39;. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-190283571">Hi Karen,<br/>
A little late here but had to chime in...I&#39;m in the same boat too so I<br/>
don&#39;t have any advice but I&#39;m loving to hear from those responding to<br/>
your original post...I&#39;ve had five wonderful darlings...I weaned my 8<br/>
yr old (boy) when he was 3 (before my RU days) but he still wishes he<br/>
could nurse!...my 6 year old (girl) self weaned while I was pregnant<br/>
with #3.  My three year old (girl) still nurses VERY frequently and so<br/>
does my 19 month old (girl).  The situation I have is my 3 year old<br/>
nurses more than the baby! My baby has become so attuned to the three<br/>
year old that if the 3 year old falls or cries...the baby comes<br/>
running to me trying to beat her for boobie, even if she was happy<br/>
doing something and not even thinking about nursing.  We usually end<br/>
up doing doubles anyway which is really hard to manage when I&#39;m in<br/>
public somewhere...then I have to negotiate with both and try to find<br/>
a happy solution.  I do still enjoy nursing when it&#39;s a nice, quiet,<br/>
cuddling, time but when I have two fighting over me and vying for<br/>
position...it can be very trying and tiring.  Then it&#39;s a competition<br/>
as to who holds my necklace/locket while they nurse...they switch when<br/>
they switch sides...hilarious, really.  Gotta love kids!  I know I<br/>
do...I must be crazy because we&#39;re trying for #6!  and I turn 40 in 3<br/>
weeks!  Somebody stop me!!! :)  Will I be nursing 3???<br/>
