<div id="ygrps-yiv-985192374">Hello!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m returning to this list, after having been nomail forever, because<br/>
it&#39;s finally time for me n mine to get serious about this. So here&#39;s<br/>
my re-intro:<br/>
<br/>
My name is Laureen, and I live in northern CA with my four-year old<br/>
DS#1 Rowan, and one year old DS#2 Kestrel, and DH Jason. We&#39;ve done<br/>
the whole AP package; cosleeping, babywearing, EC (I see some familiar<br/>
faces from the EC list), yada yada yada. DH and I were committed to<br/>
homeschooling before we even became parents. DH was a &quot;bad boy&quot;,<br/>
consistently being punished by the educational system, and I was a<br/>
&quot;good girl&quot;, consistently doing what I was told and getting &quot;rewarded&quot;<br/>
(HA!) for that. We both feel we were poorly served by that whole<br/>
system, and if a kid with all the advantages and a kid with none both<br/>
came out disgusted, well, then, it&#39;s not much of a stretch to<br/>
recognize that there&#39;s got to be a better way.<br/>
<br/>
Due to hanging out on the Continuum Concept list on and off, I became<br/>
familiar with unschooling, and that just felt right. So here we are. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have many concerns with the theory, or with the actual doing.<br/>
My concerns are all legal/political. I don&#39;t understand how you manage<br/>
to do this without having the law on your back. So, a bit more<br/>
specifically:<br/>
<br/>
* Is there anyplace I can go to find out what paperwork is required,<br/>
and how to deal with it?<br/>
<br/>
* Are there any gotchas or tips collected anyplace for dealing with<br/>
the inevitable hassles?<br/>
<br/>
* My family is in the process of selling our house and moving onto a<br/>
boat, permanently (cruising). Does anyone know of any special<br/>
resources or information for &quot;the rules&quot; that would apply if we&#39;re in<br/>
constantly shifting political status?<br/>
<br/>
* Has anyone here successfully unschooled while aboard?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m probably being a bit of a pawlicker here. Part of my concern with<br/>
the legalities is that I have been threatened by family for my<br/>
freakish ways before (mostly-unassisted homebirth VBAC), and I want<br/>
all my ducks in a row. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks much for your patience if these questions have been asked a<br/>
bazillion times before!! I know that topics on most lists go round and<br/>
round, but for a new person, it&#39;s tough to know what search terms to<br/>
use in poking around the archives.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>CA homeschoolnetwork has a great website with info. In CA, you have <br/>
a variety of options but the one it seems most folks use (at least <br/>
unschoolers anyhow) is to file the R4 private school affadavit. Once <br/>
you do that, you ARE a private school with no reporting obligations <br/>
to the state at all. See the CHN site for details (and links to <br/>
where to get the form to file, I believe the CA DoE has it online <br/>
now).<br/>
 <br/>

 </span></blockquote>The hassles are not &quot;inevitable&quot; when it comes to legal stuff. <br/>
Family and friends are a whole different thing and that all varies <br/>
depending on the relationship and all. If you know that there will <br/>
be doubting relatives, simply don&#39;t open it up for debate at <br/>
all. &quot;It&#39;s our decision. Period. Let&#39;s discuss something else.&quot; and <br/>
move on or hang up the phone.<br/>
 <br/>

someplace to get your mail, someplace you&#39;d use to file taxes and <br/>
all like that (whether it&#39;s in the US or elsewhere). That&#39;s the <br/>
statutes you would go by, I would think - that&#39;s where your kids <br/>
would go to school if they were going to go to school. If you get <br/>
to &quot;pick&quot; where to call home, CA isn&#39;t bad (the R4 filing is annual <br/>
but not burdensome as far as I can tell) and there are other states, <br/>
such as AK, CT, DC, ID, IL, IN, MI, NJ, OK, and TX that don&#39;t even <br/>
require that - no notification, no testing, no portfolios, nada. <br/>
We&#39;re in CT and have never contacted nor been contacted by the <br/>
school system and DS is 8. <br/>
<br/>
Also, closely check whichever state is &quot;home&quot; as to the compulsory <br/>
attendance age (the age at which you are required to send the child <br/>
to school or file paperwork) - in CA, for example, it&#39;s 6 (by a <br/>
certain cut off date I believe). In CT, where we are, any parent, <br/>
whether or not they homeschool or intend to homeschool can file a <br/>
waiver until their child is turning 7. And so on.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If &quot;home&quot; is a place that requires paperwork, be sure to keep copies <br/>
(preferably stamped &quot;Received&quot; and the date or some way indicating <br/>
that it was indeed send in and received by the proper office) on <br/>
hand, perhaps in a waterproof pouch in your safe (someplace you can <br/>
get at easily enough but that won&#39;t get waterlogged).<br/>
