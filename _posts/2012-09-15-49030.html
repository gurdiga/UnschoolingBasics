<div id="ygrps-yiv-1578557589">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like some advice regarding an activity that both of my children (ages 9 and 10) looooove, watching YouTube videos related to their interests. While I&#39;m happy that they&#39;re enjoying/learning from the videos, I also want to be present as much as possible for two reasons: so that I can share their joy :)and also to be available for discussion. We&#39;ve come across some pretty wacky videos & I feel responsible for being present.<br/>
<br/>
The only difficulty I have is that I can&#39;t split myself in two! Often I&#39;m really engaged with one child while the other wants to get on YouTube. It&#39;s never really a shared activity between both siblings. <br/>
<br/>
Any ideas/advice?? Thanks so much in advance. This group really has been a life saver!</div>

It&#39;s sweet that you want to be with your kids - and presumably they enjoy your company and want to be with you, too. That&#39;s great. One of the harder things I&#39;ve learned while unschooling, though, is that the older my kids get, they less what they learn is connected to me in any way. I might get to hear about it, I might not. <br/>
<br/>
Your kids are 9 and 10. If they&#39;re clamoring for your company, look for ways to bring more activities into the same space, so you can be there for both of them. But they may not be clamoring. They may be pretty happy exploring on their own and talking to you now and then, when you stop in with a snack and a kiss. If all y&#39;all have facebook accounts, they can share their favorite videos there, too, so you can get another chance to see what they&#39;re doing (love, love facebook for that! so much better than looking over my super-introverted daughter&#39;s shoulder!) and comment on it there. <br/>
