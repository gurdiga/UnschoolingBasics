<div id="ygrps-yiv-137861123">I just wanted to post what my daughter(6 1/2) said today.  She asked <br/>
if we could unschool our pets (one cat, two rats and two hermit <br/>
crabs).  I asked how we could do that.  She said, &quot;You know, don&#39;t <br/>
talk baby talk to them and let them go when they want to.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I just love it.<br/>
