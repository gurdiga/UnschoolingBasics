<div id="ygrps-yiv-1897917497">I do believe that a LOT of kids become night owls in puberty. I&#39;m sure<br/>
there are plenty of morning people too, but I know it was in puberty<br/>
that I started to have trouble sleeping at a reasonable time for the<br/>
school schedule. I thought I had insomnia. As an adult, I figured out<br/>
that I&#39;m simply a night owl (BIG TIME) and have been for a very long time.<br/>
<br/>
Trevor&#39;s sleep rotates every week or so. He&#39;s up all night and sleeps<br/>
all day and then slowly works back towards sleeping all night and<br/>
being up in the morning. It&#39;s interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Jared has always been a big morning person. Couldn&#39;t stay awake past<br/>
11pm for the most part. He&#39;s going to be 13 in August and just<br/>
recently he&#39;s started staying up at night and being up later.<br/>
<br/>
I have two more that are tired by 1am usually :), but they&#39;ve always<br/>
been that way so not a puberty thing at all (they&#39;re 9 and 5).<br/>

<br/>
This is my dd&#39;s first year out of school (13, she&#39;ll be 14 in Sep) so <br/>
we&#39;re still deschooling, although she has been emerging lately from <br/>
time to time from her computer and video games.   She&#39;s always been a <br/>
night owl, and it was one of the issues when she was going to school, <br/>
it&#39;s always taken her a long time to wind down and go to sleep, them <br/>
it was like pulling teeth to get her up in the morning for school <br/>
(don&#39;t miss that AT ALL!).   I&#39;m a night owl too, and since this is <br/>
also my first time not working full time, I don&#39;t have to get up <br/>
early, so we can go with the flow.   She will stay up until 1, 2 or <br/>
sometimes 3 AM, then sleep until noon or later, usually not past 2PM.  <br/>
Lately, though, I have a hard time going back to sleep if I get up to <br/>
use the bathroom at 7AM or so, and it&#39;s catching up with me.  If I <br/>
give her lots of warning that I need to get to sleep earlier (and <br/>
we&#39;ve discussed this at length), she&#39;s been great about ending her <br/>
day, even though it takes her an hour or more.   I feel we respect <br/>
what the other needs.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That might be related to daylight.  There is something about full-<br/>
spectrum light that sets our circadian rhythms.<br/>
