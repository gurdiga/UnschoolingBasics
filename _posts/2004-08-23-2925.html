<div id="ygrps-yiv-1876493923">&quot;I&#39;ve read just about everything of her&#39;s I can get my hands on,&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s too bad there&#39;s one less place her voice is being heard...BUT, <br/>
I&#39;ve heard the new &quot;Live Free, Learn Free&quot; is a neat mag. Maybe <br/>
Shana (whom I belive is here) can give us the lowdown on the first <br/>
issue, for those of us that missed it.<br/>
Tell us more Shana!  Who has articles in your first issue? Why don&#39;t <br/>
you post the link again and also add it to one of our categories in <br/>
the &quot;files&quot; section of this site.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you that are newer to the list, please visit the actual <br/>
unschoolingbasics site. We have links to all sorts of great <br/>
unschooling resources in our &quot;links&quot; section.<br/>
