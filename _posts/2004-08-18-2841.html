YES!<br/>
I can see Valerie answering the door: &quot;Oh, hi Mom and Dad, good to see you. Could you hold on a sec? I need to do something.&quot; <br/>
Then a mad rush to the kitchen while her parents stand in the doorway with puzzled looks.<br/>

spatula and scraped like a mad woman. It didn&#39;t matter that it was <br/>
early afternoon and I was still in my gown. I did NOT want to <br/>
explain those &quot;disgusting&quot; words on my fridge. There were 3 - 20+ <br/>
year olds living here at the time. They were..uhm...imaginative with <br/>
the words. My parents would never have spoken to me again.<br/>
<br/>
A few minutes later, I&#39;m sitting uncomfortably on my couch with Mom <br/>
and look down and one of the words is stuck to the top of my foot. <br/>
Fancy footwork at its finest! Mom wouldn&#39;t know the word, but there <br/>
was no way I wanted to define it for her. Sheeesh!<br/>
<br/>
love, Valerie<br/>
