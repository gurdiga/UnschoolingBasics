<div id="ygrps-yiv-165265164">hi,<br/>
<br/>
i am new to the group.  My name is susan and I have two children. <br/>
Keir is 8 and 1/2 and Lara is 2.<br/>
<br/>
I took keir out of school last june, and have only just begun to be<br/>
autonomous.<br/>
<br/>
Things are going ok.  I&#39;m struggling with loosing the control over<br/>
everything, strangely more with my 2 year old than with my eldest.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m struggling getting my husband to say &#39;yes&#39; more than &#39;no&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m struggling with the bedtime thing.  not really knowing when my<br/>
husband and I would get time alone.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve loads of worries.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure if this is the right place for me but found the link on<br/>
sandra dodd website, (or on a link on a link)<br/>
<br/>
Any help/experiences seem to help me enormously<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-881170266">Welcome, Susan!  This is a great adventure that you&#39;re starting, but don&#39;t<br/>
feel you have to change everything all at once. That can be confusing for<br/>
the kids and hard on hubbies that are not quite there yet.  Say yes more<br/>
often. Spend lots of time with your kids doing the things they like to do.<br/>
Let the changes unfold naturally. But do let the changes happen. Be<br/>
respectful to your kids and your husband. And read, read, read about<br/>
unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2076749195">Hi Susan...<br/>
<br/>
Welcome!<br/>
This is a great place to learn about unschooling. Take some time and <br/>
read some of the older threads. There&#39;s a lot of information there. <br/>
You said you came here through Sandra&#39;s site...that&#39;s another good <br/>
place to poke around and do some reading. <br/>

It&#39;s simple, but it&#39;s not easy! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You can *understand* the concept, but struggle *so* much putting it <br/>
into practice! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Have you simply announced, &quot;It&#39;s a free-for-all. Go for it!&quot; Or are you <br/>
quietly letting up on the controls?<br/>
<br/>
Often littluns are jarred and have no basis for handling that much <br/>
freedom if it&#39;s new. E-e-e-a-a-a-s-s-s-e-e-e into it.<br/>
<br/>
Suggest to your husband that he should take one deeep breath before he <br/>
answers. That will give him an extra few seconds to *think* about what <br/>
he&#39;s refusing to allow and give him a few seconds to ponder *why*.<br/>
<br/>
Your children are young. Are you helping them settle down for the night <br/>
(warm bath, dim lights, foot rubs, songs/stories)? or just letting them <br/>
stay up until they crash?<br/>
<br/>
As for sex, it needn&#39;t happen at night---or in the bed! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This should be the place. Can you be more specific?<br/>
<br/>
