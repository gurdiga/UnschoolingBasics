<div id="ygrps-yiv-514670586">First off my girls refused to take showers last night.  So I let it <br/>
go....no biggy.  My oldest got in the shower this morning without me <br/>
asking.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest came down stairs dressed for Church, and she looked <br/>
absolutely ridiculous.  I told her, her pants were way too short.  <br/>
She said she wanted to wear them.  Now there was a time that I <br/>
completely controlled what my kids wore.  My daughter is 8, and ever <br/>
since she was about 7 she has her own ideas about what she wants to <br/>
wear.  So I let it go.  In the scheme of things who cares if she <br/>
goes off to Church in pants that are too short. <br/>
<br/>
Now my youngest said to me that her tummy hurt, and she&#39;s not going <br/>
to Church.  So I stayed home with her, and sent hubby, oldest <br/>
daughter, and my Mother on their way to Church.  My husband told my <br/>
youngest that she is not going outside to play later if she is not <br/>
going to Church.  I pulled him aside and said &quot;why not?&quot;  Really <br/>
what is the big deal?  She&#39;s not running a fever.  She probably just <br/>
does not want to go to Church, and I don&#39;t believe in forcing my <br/>
children to go to Church.  So I convinced hubby to let that one go.<br/>
<br/>
My Mother is staying with us, because I had knee surgery.  She flew <br/>
out to take care of the kids while I recovered.  I&#39;m fine at this <br/>
point.  But anyway I know all this stuff is driving her crazy <br/>
because she is very traditional in her thinking.  It&#39;s driving her <br/>
nuts that I don&#39;t make my kids go to bed.  Well my girls go to bed <br/>
every night on their own by 10 p.m.  I don&#39;t see what the big deal <br/>
is.  My youngest is really good about listening to her body and <br/>
getting enough sleep.  <br/>
<br/>
So slowly I am learning to let go.  My 6 year old has Aspergers, and <br/>
Sensory Processing Disorder.  Part of Aspergers (atleast for my <br/>
daughter) is having a hard time changing from one thing to another <br/>
and having severe temper tantrums.  So life is hard enough having a <br/>
special needs child in the house.  She can dig her heals in like <br/>
nobody I have ever come across in my lifetime.  Getting into a power <br/>
struggle with her is just useless, and makes the whole house <br/>
miserable.  So letting go of things that don&#39;t really matter is a <br/>
good thing.  <br/>

said that, he would not be caught dead out in public wearing sweat <br/>
pants.  Don&#39;t ask me why &#39;cause I don&#39;t know, and it doesn&#39;t <br/>
matter.  He feels good with his own, unique look, and that&#39;s fine <br/>
with me!  (Truth is, it caught me up short the first time we were <br/>
ready to go and his pants were like that, but I could see he felt so <br/>

I do know this, though:  Every time we choose a path of peace, life <br/>

controlling things like what our kids wear or what time they go to <br/>
bed, we embrace a more peaceful, loving life with our <br/>
kids.  Conversely, choosing power struggles about these things can <br/>
drive a wedge between us and our kids and make a peaceful, loving <br/>
life just that much more remote.  This has been my experience, <br/>
anyway, and I wouldn&#39;t trade one moment of walking joyfully down the <br/>
street with my son feeling good about his one-leg-on-one-leg-off look <br/>
for ANYthing!  Anyway, his feeling so good about it makes that look <br/>
work beautifully!<br/>

<br/>
Dylan stopped wearing sweatpants in public when he started carrying stuff <br/>
with him.  Sweat pants pockets are unreliable - things can slide out when <br/>
one sits down.   When he started carrying a pocket knife, leatherman, <br/>
flashlight, (in case of sudden darkness&lt;g&gt;)  pocket watch, wallet, he <br/>
stopped wearing sweatpants out of the house.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1369796767">Marji, your post reminded me of my boys!  They don&#39;t care and have never cared about matching socks.  According to their reasoning, the socks are on their feet because if they don&#39;t wear them their shoes hurt their feet.  ~Their reasoning not mine~ Well yesterday we were headed out the door to a 4-h meeting.  I looked down at my 7 yr old son, and he had on his dad&#39;s socks, one brown wool sock and one regular white knee sock.  As you can imagine, that looked very funny with the heel clear up on his leg! :-)  But very cute.  I was thinking back to a time several yrs ago.  I was taking one of my other sons to a dr appmnt.  He had a red sock on and a black sock on.  One was the &quot;slipper&quot; type sock the other just a reg sock.  I turned around, took him home and made him change socks.  We started out again, without me looking at the socks, but him saying he&#39;d changed them.  Got down the road, I glanced over and he had on one short white sock and one long white sock. It should have<br/>
 been obvious to me then that the sock issue just didn&#39;t matter to him.  Needless to say I&#39;ve come a long way since then! <br/>

Doesn&#39;t it feel so good to just let go?  My ds (4.5) was so easy going until he turned 3, and <br/>
that&#39;s when we started with the traditional parenting tactics, which he totally resisted.  <br/>
Since embracing radical unschooling approx. 8 mos. ago our house is so much more <br/>
peaceful.  My dh and I were just talking about letting go with our ds last night and how <br/>
much ds is learning by making his own decisions.  For about 6 months ds wore all of his <br/>
clothes backwards (including underwear), and occasionally I would slip up (worried about <br/>
what someone might say) and tell him &quot;you need to turn your shorts around, because <br/>
we&#39;re going to the store, ect...&quot;, and he resisted and resisted, and finally I just let it go.  As <br/>
far as sleeping and eating are concerned, we want him to listen to his body and no one <br/>
else (including us), and we have had conversations with him about listening to his body.  <br/>
Sometimes he falls asleep at 8:00, and sometimes not until 11:00, but consistently sleeps <br/>
approx. 10 hours either way.  Also the whole bath/shower thing, before embracing <br/>
unschooling we were having major power struggles with him to take a bath if it had been a <br/>
week since he had one.  For awhile I think he was testing us, going 2 weeks or more in <br/>
between bathing, relishing his new found freedom, and now he consistently takes a bath <br/>
twice a week, and he requests it, not us. <br/>
<br/>
There is just much more peace on so many levels with unschooling, it&#39;s just re-training <br/>
ourselves as parents I think to go against society and listen to our children, because they <br/>
know what&#39;s best for themselves, not us.<br/>
