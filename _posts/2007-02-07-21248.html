<div id="ygrps-yiv-2085337814">Hi All,<br/>
I&#39;m looking for some wisdom here. Anyone that knows me knows that <br/>
I&#39;m not big into pets. I think of the mess before anything else. I <br/>
*have* been a dog owner though so I do know what it entails somewhat.<br/>
<br/>
What I haven&#39;t had, though, is experience with a family dog(as a <br/>
parent, had a dog for a short time as a teen). The dog we had when <br/>
the kids were little was my husband&#39;s old dog. It was given back to <br/>
us after my mom couldn&#39;t take care of him anymore and I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
regard him as a family pet as he was outside/in the basement most of <br/>
the short time we had him.<br/>
<br/>
I listed to my husband all the reasons why NOT to have a dog. I got <br/>
to my second set of fingers (meaning more than 10) before I started <br/>
to slow down. I then tried to mention the things that were pros and <br/>
only got to 3.<br/>
<br/>
We have the opportunity to get a 3 yr old choc lab. The fact that <br/>
he&#39;s not a chew-the-furniture-go-on-the-floor age is a major plus so <br/>
I&#39;m happy with that. When we mentioned it to the kids, they were <br/>
estatic with the idea, but aren&#39;t most kids?<br/>
<br/>
Any really important reasons why I should consider this??<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your input. If you&#39;d like you can email me offlist @ <br/>

Thanks again in advance,<br/>

<br/>
you should consider it because the chocolate lab will  show you how to love <br/>
the way God loves; how to forgive unconditionally,  how to be happy even when <br/>
in pain or even when not treated exactly the way  you want to be treated. He <br/>
will teach you lessons about how to be a better  human being that no human being <br/>
can teach you. He will fill your house  with joy, give your life more <br/>
purpose, and when he dies you will not know  how to live one second without him. You <br/>
will see him in every corner and  you&#39;ll think you hear his footsteps at <br/>
night. You will look at the foot of  the bed and cry because you wish he was still <br/>
there. THERE IS NOTHING like  a dog to make your family whole - complete - and <br/>
wonderful! And a  chocolate lab! WOW, what a great breed! There is nothing <br/>
like a lab -  America&#39;s favorite breed!!!<br/>
 <br/>
We pick up our 4th dog Gershwin, a white/cream  Labradoodle this Friday <br/>
morning. The kids and I can barely sleep at  night from excitement.<br/>
 <br/>
THERE IS NOTHING LIKE A DOG!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
Please give this a try!<br/>

way bigger point than any of the others.<br/>
<br/>
If you were to do the same kind of pros and cons for having kids, I  <br/>
think the cons would come out way ahead. ;-) Kids *are* inconvenient.  <br/>
Dogs are too.<br/>
<br/>
We make the effort to get kids to the museum, to fireworks, to weekly  <br/>
dance classes because it&#39;s something they value not because the  <br/>
number of pros outnumber the cons.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t make the cons of dogs go away ;-) I think the most  <br/>
helpful mindset with getting pets for the kids is that it&#39;s an  <br/>
experience we want to give them and to expect to take care of the  <br/>
ptes while inviting the kids along to help.<br/>

Wouldn&#39;t your children&#39;s ecstatic emotions be enough? &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Older dogs make GREAT pets usually, although they too can come with <br/>
issues. Why is the family giving him away?<br/>
<br/>
Although I don&#39;t do well with sibling issues or highly <br/>
sensitive/explosive/angry/difficult child questions, I can help with <br/>
*this*. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1255812293">Another reason... (totally has nothing to do with the kids)...<br/>
   <br/>
  There are so many animals out there who get put to sleep everyday. I think that if you are willing to open your heart and home to a dog, then that is awesome!<br/>
   <br/>
  I run an animal rescue and see so many homeless animals.. I think if everyone would make the consideration you are... then there would be alot more happy endings for the dogs (AND for the happy kids who now have a pet!!)<br/>
   <br/>
  Thanks for considering it!! Thats a topic that is close to the heart for me :)<br/>

Companionship<br/>
Memories<br/>
Happy memories<br/>
Lasting memories<br/>
Giggles and smiles<br/>
 <br/>
A little story for you.<br/>
As a small child living in Ayer , MA my father used to bring home stray  <br/>
dogs. Mom hated it. I don&#39;t remember that part much but what i do remember is  dad <br/>
leaving and the dogs leaving too. I spent a good 8+ years longing for a dog  <br/>
every holiday and birthday. I was heart broken every time those days came and  <br/>
went.<br/>
 <br/>
My mother never got it bc she couldn&#39;t be bothered with the upkeep. It was  <br/>
more about the cleaning than the connection to her. My story is one of  <br/>
separation and divorce but I have happier days to share. <br/>
I breed Brittanys now.. we have 5 of them 2 males and 3 females(which  are <br/>
expecting ). Our children still light up when they see the dogs and  cuddle when <br/>
one of the dogs comes to lay down. Our dogs have been through every  test you <br/>
can imagine and some day I swear they wouldn&#39;t have it any other way:)  You <br/>
see they are part of the family. They are part of who we are. Each year  we <br/>
have 1-3 litters and our children get to see every happy face that comes  through <br/>
our door. Memories and stories of past dogs being replaced with new and  <br/>
those who never owned a dog making new memories. Nervous parents with happy  <br/>
giggling children running around the yard with their new puppy. <br/>
We can deny what we fear... the feelings we may never know we  had.... but we <br/>
will never know until we open that door of hope... A smile,  a dream.. a <br/>
memory to last a lifetime...of what could be..<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-453359091">One thing I&#39;d for sure want to know is WHY a 3 yr old dog is needing a<br/>
new home. Is he coming from a shelter? Is the current owner&#39;s lifestyle<br/>
changing (moving to an apartment for instance)? <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;d also want to meet the dog first for a good long visit, with the<br/>
whole family there. Just because he&#39;s 3 don&#39;t discount the fact that<br/>
labs can sometimes be very &#39;mouthy&#39; and want to chew - plan on having<br/>
lots of big bones and other chewables - keep in mind that labs are<br/>
designed to retrieve - pick up things in their mouths. It won&#39;t be<br/>
&#39;teething&#39; that you&#39;d have with a puppy but there still might be chewing<br/>
situations. <br/>
 <br/>
When we started looking for a dog, DS was about 4. I grew up with dogs,<br/>
so I was really excited about it when we finally had our own home and<br/>
could even think about being owned by a pup. I also had a checklist of<br/>
behavioral &#39;tests&#39; in my head for any potential dog addition to our<br/>
family. We found our pup (he&#39;s now about 6 years old, a yellow<br/>
lab/golden retriever mix) at a shelter. I watched -really- carefully to<br/>
see how he would react to DH (6 feet tall, big, bearded male) and how he<br/>
would react to DS (at the time, 4 yr old, excited, bouncy child). I<br/>
wanted to NOT see cowering or cringing toward DH - a scared dog is more<br/>
likely to feel cornered and react aggressively. I also did not want to<br/>
see aggression toward DS, a &#39;smaller&#39; member of the &#39;pack&#39;. <br/>
 <br/>
One thing to consider (if you haven&#39;t already) is that labs need lots of<br/>
exercise and play. And, they want to be WITH you, they are very social.<br/>
They are not happy if left alone a lot. Our lab thinks he&#39;s a lap dog -<br/>
anyone sitting on the couch can expect him to climb up onto their lap if<br/>
they aren&#39;t paying attention (though you can also teach him to stay off<br/>
the furniture - we don&#39;t bother - our third hand couch is fine for dogs<br/>
and kids, we deliberately don&#39;t have &#39;good&#39; furniture at this stage).<br/>
One positive is that labs are super trainable specifically because they<br/>
are such pack, people pleaser critters. Once you establish yourself<br/>
(you, DH, the kids) as the top of the pecking order and the dog at the<br/>
bottom, they will do just about anything you care to teach them. When we<br/>
got Bucky (our lab), we also got the invisible fence so he could go in<br/>
and out at will and have the run of the yard. The trainer (came with the<br/>
purchase of the fence) noted that labs are particularly easy to train<br/>
because they want to please. <br/>
 <br/>
Can you maybe arrange a weekend &#39;trial visit&#39; with no strings - &quot;pet<br/>
sitting&quot; if you will. That way you&#39;d get to see the dog in your<br/>
environment. The shelter we got our lab from *requires* an overnight<br/>
&#39;trial&#39; visit before they will finalize the adoption (even though I knew<br/>
right away that this was Our Dog, I complied and then went back the next<br/>
day they were open and did the paperwork).<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;d also want to prep the kids ahead of time as to how to &#39;meet&#39; a new<br/>
dog so there are no mishaps due to excitement - approaching slowly, one<br/>
hand out slightly palm down to allow the dog to sniff you before you<br/>
even touch the dog to start with. Don&#39;t raise your hand quickly above<br/>
the dogs head  since they can&#39;t see there and might consider it a threat<br/>
(particularly if they&#39;ve been smacked for misbehaving) - this is a tough<br/>
one because it seems everyone wants to just scratch a pup&#39;s head or ears<br/>
(it&#39;s SOOOOO soft there). It can be better to start with patting the<br/>
mid-back, the head and throat area are more likely to evoke a &#39;threat&#39;<br/>
reaction than the middle of the back.<br/>
 <br/>
Having a good family dog is really worth it (speaking as both a person<br/>
who always had a dog around growing up and now as a parent with a family<br/>
dog)<br/>

Wish we were near you - we&#39;d probably have a houseful of adoptees! Okay,<br/>
probably not - DH&#39;s limit is two (or one very active lab LOL). I&#39;d<br/>
volunteer to help you with the animal care though if you needed it. And,<br/>
our current dog is a rescue from a shelter near us (a no-kill shelter<br/>
BTW. Bucky was a stray picked up in the city near us and the city pound<br/>
has a strict limit on the length of stay, if they aren&#39;t adopted or<br/>
reclaimed, that&#39;s it. So, the shelter will go and &#39;adopt&#39; any that are<br/>
near the end of their stay that they have room for in their facility.<br/>
That&#39;s how we got Bucky)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1096236439">Okay I dont want to make this long.. so I just wanted to say that.. <br/>
with dogs- they are way more likely to follow the &quot;nurture&quot; than <br/>
the &quot;nature&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
This dog is three. If he was never given a chew toy, he probably has <br/>
no will to chew. He is beyond his puppy stage and is probably set in <br/>
his ways. However, if hes a chewer you will know right away. Try <br/>
taking a chew toy with you when you go see him (n orawhides) and see <br/>
what he does.<br/>
<br/>
And the question &quot;why does he need a new home when hes three&quot;.... if <br/>
you only knew. Most people who get large breed dogs just simply <br/>
don&#39;t realize how big the dog will get and decide its not for them. <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;d like to chat with me about &quot;2nd chance&quot; animals.. (meaning <br/>
animals who have already had a previous home).. feel free to email <br/>
me off-list. While I&#39;m sure the below poster means well (and has <br/>
alot of good points in there if youre starting with a puppy or very <br/>
young dog).. I do this every day of my life and I know what to look <br/>
for and what to expect in dogs out of their &quot;puppy stage&quot;. <br/>
Especially with large breed dogs :)<br/>
<br/>
One other thing I&#39;d like to add that I noticed was mentioned... <br/>
invisible fences are nice.. but only for the convenience of the <br/>
owner.<br/>
<br/>
Invisible fences MAY keep your dog in, but what keeps other dogs <br/>
out? How do you keep strays from coming into your yard and fighting <br/>
with your dog? How do you keep out disease-ridden critters without a <br/>
true fence (a structure, not a buried wire)? How do you insure that <br/>
a child doesnt wander into your yard and stratle your dog and your <br/>
dog possibly bites this child. Now you are left with a lawsuit and <br/>
your dog to be put to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
Another FYI... there was recently a test using german shepards, <br/>
cocker spaniels, and toy poodles, all of three different sizes.. <br/>
where they were exposed to a dog being walked by on the other side <br/>
of the &quot;invisible fence&quot;. In over 70% of the trials, the dog in <br/>
question ran right through the fence. None of the three dogs were <br/>
more or less likely to do so. Something to think about...<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion... invisible fences are one of the warst things you <br/>
can do to your pet.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll get off my soap box now.. sorry :)<br/>
<br/>

Hi Tonya,<br/>
<br/>
Its taken me awhile to respond to this but here&#39;s a story.  My kids had <br/>
begged for a dog for years.  With the rabbits and fish and other critters we&#39;ve <br/>
had, the responsibility for their care has always been up to me so I was sure I <br/>
didn&#39;t want to add a dog to the mix.  One day last summer I saw an ad on <br/>
freecycle from a family who was desperate to find a loving home for their <br/>
kid-friendly, 4 year old black lab.  After considering it for a few days, I responded to <br/>
the ad with a bunch of questions.  The family had two young children (3 and <br/>
4) who loved the dog, rode on him etc.  They were unable to keep the dog due to <br/>
their living situation.  We went, just to meet the dog, that afternoon and <br/>
figured out from the appearance of things that these people were either about to <br/>
become homeless or were moving in with someone.  The dog had not been to the <br/>
vet in years, had no rabies shots or heartworm tests, etc.  He was a <br/>
beautiful, overweight black lab with a shabby coat and some serious, flaky excema.  We <br/>
took him home.  On the ride, he puked all over our van--his fat stomach was <br/>
full of grapes (he had been eating from their yard) and rock hard chunks of <br/>
Italian bread.  They had no dog food or bowls or a leash for the dog.  We <br/>
immediately brought him to the vet and he got caught up on his shots and got a clean <br/>
bill of health except that he weighed 88 lbs which was a bit overweight.  He&#39;s <br/>
been with us since July and we have NO regrets.  He warns us of any intruders <br/>
or passersby.  My husband works odd hours so it has been very reassuring <br/>
having our watch dog here to let us know when someone is coming.  He is very <br/>
protective of the children and I have no doubt that if a coyote came into the yard <br/>
(or anyone) he would kill to protect them.  His one tragic flaw is that he <br/>
likes his freedom and does not come when we call him.  Thanks to our dog whisperer <br/>
friend who has been helping us train him, he is doing better but not <br/>
completely.  I still chase him around the neighborhood at least once a week but it <br/>
used to be ten times a day.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the most telling story about how much we love this dog; his name is <br/>
Lucky.  My three year old has never really had an indoor animal.  When she was <br/>
born we had two cats but both met their demise in our yard with some coyotes so <br/>
she has had very limited interaction with cats and dogs.  In the beginning <br/>
she was constantly torturing the dog, squeezing her arms tightly around his neck <br/>
and calling it hugging, yanking him around on the leash, pulling his tail and <br/>
so on.  The worst thing she did was that she occasionally grabbed his penis, <br/>
the red, sensitive part that pops out (we call it his lipstick).  He usually <br/>
yelped and we corrected her and told her that that was his private penis and <br/>
that it hurt him when it was touched.  One night she got him good.  We were all <br/>
sitting right there but nobody is exactly sure what she did to cause him to <br/>
yelp in pain and lash out at her.  The dog bit her face, scraping his canine <br/>
teeth and his tiny front teeth across her cheek.  We all freaked out and we found <br/>
a new home for the dog.  The family that was planning to take Lucky needed a <br/>
week to prepare for his arrival so we agreed to keep him away from our three <br/>
year old until they could come for him.  During that week I mourned the loss of <br/>
him and we realized we loved him so much (the kids and I cried daily about <br/>
parting with him) and that we would never find a dog that would be as perfect <br/>
for us as he was.  We decided to give it another shot and be hyper vigilant when <br/>
the 3 year old was around him.  It has been months since the bite and most <br/>
people think we were nuts to &quot;sacrifice&quot; our daughter&#39;s face and keep the dog, <br/>
but we have no regrets.  The baby is completely healed (no scars) and the dog <br/>
is hers.  He guards her 24/7 and sleeps at the foot of the bed/couch/hammock <br/>
wherever she is.  She has learned to respect him and has not tried to grab his <br/>
penis or hurt him since his reaction.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway Tonya,  let your kids get the dog!  I&#39;d take a vote and agree to go <br/>
with what the majority decides.  Kids (families) need dogs!<br/>
<br/>
My alcoholic neighbor, a MA state trooper, used to lurk around our yard at <br/>
night.  I&#39;d find his cigarette butts in my driveway and would often smell smoke <br/>
wafting through the windows at night while my husband was working.  We live <br/>
far enough from each other that we cannot smell his smoke or even hear each <br/>
other if we stay in our own yards. He has even been in our pool on hot summer <br/>
nights, drunk and without permission. He had become a liability and we installed <br/>
motion sensored lighting just for him.  Since we got Lucky, he has stopped <br/>
lurking.  Just another reason to have an alert dog around.<br/>
<br/>
Go for it!  What have you got to lose?<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
Robin<br/>
