<div id="ygrps-yiv-115158941">I&#39;ve written the Florida Academy-Pet Grooming School<br/>
and asked if we could visit or even if they knew of<br/>
anyone that wouldn&#39;t mind a 7yo helping out every now<br/>
in order to learn hands-on about pet grooming.  When I<br/>
checked out their staff page I saw that the owner is<br/>
also a cartoonist!  Brooke has been at<br/>
www.garfield.com everyday for days in a row, taking<br/>
the free lessons that Cartoonist Jim Davis has<br/>
available.  <br/>
<br/>
Please keep your fingers crossed for Brooke.  The Cat<br/>
Show was cancelled and her heart was broken, I<br/>
promised that I would TRY and find someone in this<br/>
field that we could visit and maybe help out every now<br/>
and then.  I should probably write to some more<br/>
groomers in the area but I&#39;ll wait and see what, if<br/>
anything happens here first.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for the ideas about asking groomers if<br/>
we can visit, I would have never thought of that on my<br/>
own...why I don&#39;t know, LOL.<br/>
<br/>
~Sandy  btw...I&#39;m not superstitious, but find it fun<br/>
to have positive flow regardless :-)<br/>
<br/>
Happy Learning,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-305857270">Sandy - just a word of advice......always try to go in person WITH  <br/>
your child to ask if the child can do things like this. It is very  <br/>
very likely they&#39;ll say no, in print or on the phone, but much more  <br/>
likely they&#39;ll say yes when the child is right there in front of them  <br/>

the email to the school and the this board I was hit<br/>

viewing a grooming session and a little help cleaning<br/>
up or something more along those lines. We do have dog<br/>

 <br/>
I think you would have MUCH better luck with a local *reputable* show breeder or handler!<br/>
 <br/>
Someone who breeds bearded collies or briards or maltese or westies---sometihng with coat. <br/>
 <br/>
Go to doog shows and introduce yourselves. These people are always looking for slave labor! &lt;g&gt; A reliable child who wants to learn? She&#39;ll be snatched up in a minute!<br/>
 <br/>
At first, she would be used to scoop poop and clean runs. Housesit while the breeder&#39;s away at shows. Then she would be shown how to bathe and brush the old, retired girls. After some time, she could handle clippers and shears. But a LOT of the knowledge would come from talking and watching and touching. <br/>
 <br/>
She could be taken to dog shows as kennel help---THAT&#39;S an experience in itself!<br/>
 <br/>
But I would think the shops would be *less* inclined to want a minor hanging around. A breeder could actually use the help. *Might* pay, too, but usually these are seen as mentorships---you helpme &#39;cause you want to learn.<br/>
 <br/>
Become a member of the local kennel club, go to shows, visit kennels---they should be clean! You could even look on-line---but that&#39;s risky. I&#39;d stick to the shows/clubs to find a good breeder. Word of mouth.<br/>
 <br/>
Could be the start of a new career! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-224742116">I work weekends for a boarding kennel, owned by a  woman who is a second-generation show dog breeder.  Everyone who  works there (&#39;cept me), it seems, shows or trains dogs (well, two gals  raise/train show horses) and has been in the business since  childhood.   It gets expensive to raise, train and show the  dogs, so free helpers are always welcome.   There are also  competitions just for kids who own dogs, and sometimes trainers need  home placement for retired dogs, giving families an opportunity to take  in a healthy, well-bred, well-behaved pet. <br/>
  <br/>
  For me, it&#39;s just a weekend job (I prefer rescue mutts) but for the  other folks there, it&#39;s a big part of their lives, and their kids&#39;  lives and their parents&#39; lives before them...<br/>
