<div id="ygrps-yiv-50019206">For those of you who have to do testing to unschool, I have a question.<br/>
<br/>
Do you prepare them for the test? And what happens if they fail it? Surely <br/>
there are plenty of kids who fail test in PS.<br/>
<br/>
I was just thinking that if I had to test, I would just let them take the <br/>
test. If they passed or failed, who cares. Does the state take away you <br/>
ability to keep them out of PS? We don&#39;t have testing here, so I have never <br/>
had to deal with it.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here in Geneva (Switzerland), kids are tested in French and maths every <br/>
year, according to the &quot;plan d&#39;études&quot; of the public school. They are <br/>
allowed to be homeschooled only if they succeed at these annual tests. <br/>
<br/>
This part worried me, as I wanted my kids to be free to learn at their <br/>
own pace and following their own lead, so I did what somebody here <br/>
suggested me once, on another subject : I looked for more information <br/>
(information is often a good cure for fears, that&#39;s what I had been <br/>
told, by Joyce if I remember well). I called the person in charge of <br/>
these tests and have been quite reassured : if my kid fail once, he <br/>
won&#39;t be sent back to school between two policemen. It also depends on <br/>
how far &quot;behind&quot; from the standards he is ... These tests are meant to <br/>
protect the children and the state will try to find a solution with the <br/>
parents rather than against them. <br/>
<br/>
The feeling I got from discussing with this person was that they were <br/>
quite open. But I don&#39;t know any true radical unschoolers here, so I <br/>
guess she hasn&#39;t met many either :) It&#39;s difficult in these conditions <br/>
to anticipate what her reaction could be ... That&#39;s why I would like <br/>
to &quot;train&quot; Sylvain to do the kind of exercise they&#39;ll propose, but this <br/>
only if I can do it &quot;lightly&quot; - and that was the sense of my question <br/>
in another message.<br/>
