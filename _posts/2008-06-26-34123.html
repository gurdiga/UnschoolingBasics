<div id="ygrps-yiv-1092959936">Yeah I would say sort of.  Not really in the same way though (I can&#39;t put<br/>
meat in my compost).  My point is that animals have a spirit and a<br/>
personality and I wouldn&#39;t eat a person so why would I eat a sweet animal?<br/>
This is my opinion and I know a lot of people do<br/>
not agree and that&#39;s fine.  Just stating mine.  Shari<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2088727820">I just went to this film<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.foodmatters.tv/trailer.html?gclid=CL-rzLrFkpQCFSUqagodnl83tg">http://www.foodmatters.tv/trailer.html?gclid=CL-rzLrFkpQCFSUqagodnl83tg</a> and<br/>
it is very good.  And it is on this very topic.<br/>
<br/>
 Melissa,  I hope you can forgive those of us who don&#39;t wish to put meat in<br/>
our bodies.  Actually, most vegetation is broken down before it gets to the<br/>
full blown rotting stage since our bodies produce enzymes that break it down<br/>
quickly.  If raw veggies are eaten, then one has the added benefit (and<br/>
speed of digestion) of the enzymes in the veggies themselves that help break<br/>
it down to liquid form...so we can get the nutrients.  However in the 3 days<br/>
that meat takes to liquefy, it has produced toxins as well as the nutrients<br/>
that we can absorb.  Our bodies have to work harder to get the nutrients<br/>
(since enzymes are destroyed at 118 degrees) and eliminate the toxins.<br/>
<br/>
It is true, many bodies can handle this.  It is also true that many can not.<br/>
<br/>
Mine can not.  But it took 35 years for the build-up to cause a major<br/>
disease.  And only 4 to help heal itself when given everything it needed to<br/>
heal.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had to go raw because my body was attacking itself...and food was a<br/>
burden.  It is harder to digest animal products and I couldn&#39;t afford to<br/>
have my energy placed there when it needed to cleanse out all the stuff that<br/>
was being stored in my body.<br/>
<br/>
I had RSD.  A nerve disorder.  It&#39;s no joke.  I have managed to &#39;cure&#39;<br/>
myself (I have been pain free since January 16th) by going raw and cleansing<br/>
my body.  The conventional way of treating RSD is steroids and nerve<br/>
blockers.  I chose alternative treatments (because I didn&#39;t like those<br/>
options) and food was one alternative treatment that came up.<br/>
<br/>
I wont go back to eating everything.  I may cook more of my food<br/>
again...someday.<br/>
<br/>
I also wouldn&#39;t expect anyone else to eat the way I do.  Just like I wont go<br/>
back to eating the way you do simply because you said all food rots.  My<br/>
physical body says it does matter what I put into it.  Your body may not.<br/>
<br/>
Just as an interesting side note.  All our body cells are replaced<br/>
(everything in our body - bones and all) every 2 or so years.  So why do we<br/>
have chronic disease or allergies?  It would be only part of the equation to<br/>
think the environment is the issue.  It would also be only part of the<br/>
equation to say that genetics is the issue.  And it would also be only part<br/>
of the equation to say food is the issue.<br/>
<br/>
All this being said...I still have one child who eats a great well balanced<br/>
diet and one who eats literally 6 things with little if any meat, much<br/>
dairy, no fruit and no vegetables and plenty of starches.  Both boys are<br/>
growing strong and healthy.  Thankfully their bodies aren&#39;t mine.<br/>

I totally agree with this.  There are experiments with sprouts that one<br/>
batch was actually talked to and grew really fast and green.  Another batch<br/>
was bad-mouthed and cursed to and it grew slow and yellow.  There is also a<br/>
whole book on water that was put under the same tests.  Go figure.  Our<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-184952260">I also cured myself of a chronic illness and this is the nutritional <br/>
philosophy I follow:<br/>
=========<br/>
The Weston A. Price Foundation is a nonprofit, tax-exempt charity <br/>
founded in 1999 to disseminate the research of nutrition pioneer Dr. <br/>
Weston Price, whose studies of isolated nonindustrialized peoples <br/>
established the parameters of human health and determined the optimum <br/>
characteristics of human diets. Dr. Price&#39;s research demonstrated <br/>
that humans achieve perfect physical form and perfect health <br/>
generation after generation only when they consume nutrient-dense <br/>
whole foods and the vital fat-soluble activators found exclusively in <br/>
animal fats. <br/>
<br/>
The Foundation is dedicated to restoring nutrient-dense foods to the <br/>
human diet through education, research and activism. It supports a <br/>
number of movements that contribute to this objective including <br/>
accurate nutrition instruction, organic and biodynamic farming, <br/>
pasture-feeding of livestock, community-supported farms, honest and <br/>
informative labeling, prepared parenting and nurturing therapies. <br/>
Specific goals include establishment of universal access to clean, <br/>
certified raw milk and a ban on the use of soy formula for infants.<br/>
<br/>
from westonaprice.org<br/>
=================<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not my intention to further fuel the veg/non-veg diet debate so <br/>
much, but to show that highly educated people are found on all sides <br/>
of debates like this, and I&#39;m grounded in no less informed or <br/>
scientific research than anyone else. *And* I understand that others&#39; <br/>
paths have lead them elsewhere and are in a place that&#39;s right for <br/>
them for a variety of reasons. <br/>
<br/>
I used to be a woman of My Beliefs. One byproduct of unschooling for <br/>
me has been a release from belief into celebrating the exciting but <br/>
uncertain place of I Don&#39;t Know...anything really...and certainly not <br/>
for anyone else. <br/>
<br/>
I still think the Price philosophy resonates with me the most and <br/>
makes the most sense to me intuitively and scientifically- I mean the <br/>
man studied tribal populations all over the world and looked at what <br/>
was eaten by those who enjoyed vibrant health and literally none of <br/>
the chronic disease that afflict the west. And it feels good to me <br/>
and my body eating clean, pastured meats and dairy, organic, local <br/>
veggies, etc. I can say since eating this way I am healthier in <br/>
definite, measurable ways and more energetic now in my 30s than I <br/>
recall even as a child or teen.<br/>
<br/>
But while I used to believe it was 100% nutritional therapy that <br/>
cured me, I wonder now how much it really came from the empowerment <br/>
of saying no to the medical/disease model and believing in the <br/>
potential of my body to heal &quot;just&quot; from food. Every day I grow more <br/>
convinced of the power of our thoughts to determine our health and, <br/>
well, everything in our lives. It&#39;s why Joy is now the ultimate <br/>
measure of success and effectiveness for everything in my life. Now I <br/>
wonder if it&#39;s *ever* really about the food. I Don&#39;t Know :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1487415085"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; There are experiments with sprouts that one<br/>
&gt; batch was actually talked to and grew really fast and green.   <br/>
&gt; Another batch<br/>
&gt; was bad-mouthed and cursed to and it grew slow and yellow.  There  <br/>
&gt; is also a<br/>
&gt; whole book on water that was put under the same tests.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Let&#39;s not back up sound logic and real results from real kids with  <br/>
vaguely remembered or poorly done experiments. It tarnishes the  <br/>
validity of what we&#39;re saying. If someone has a scientific finding  <br/>
that supports what&#39;s being said here, please give links to reputable  <br/>
sources.<br/>
<br/>
There are specific checks and balances that an experiment must adhere  <br/>
to to minimize outside influences. Experiments need to be repeatable  <br/>
by others. Peer review is good (though not perfect) to help catch  <br/>
holes in the technique the experimenter missed.<br/>
<br/>
A brief search of the internet didn&#39;t yield anything specific (or  <br/>
rigorous for that matter) about sprouts but it&#39;s easy enough to check  <br/>
on the water &quot;experiments&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Despite the popularity of his book, despite the &quot;cool&quot; factor,  <br/>
despite the fact that we&#39;d like it to be true, Masaru Emoto isn&#39;t  <br/>
even pretending to be scientifically rigorous.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masaru_Emoto">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masaru_Emoto</a><br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a bit from that:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Kristopher Setchfield, (BA, Health Science) from Castleton State  <br/>
&gt; College (Natural Science Department) in Vermont has made a paper  <br/>
&gt; called Review and analysis of Dr. Masaru Emoto’s published work on  <br/>
&gt; the effects of external stimuli on the structural formation of ice  <br/>
&gt; crystals[11].<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.is-masaru-emoto-for-real.com/)">http://www.is-masaru-emoto-for-real.com/)</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He concludes the following: &quot; It is this crucial lack of scientific  <br/>
&gt; foundation that prevents Dr. Emoto’s work from attracting interest  <br/>
&gt; by widely accepted and respected scientists at long-standing  <br/>
&gt; research institutions. This is unfortunate for the world if there  <br/>
&gt; is, after all, truth to his claims--as reproduction of his results  <br/>
&gt; by any scientist would lend much credence to his work. A little  <br/>
&gt; change in Emoto’s experimental design would do great things for the  <br/>
&gt; credibility of his claims. I recommend the following to ground his  <br/>
&gt; work in sound scientific principle:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    * Eliminate the possibility of the scientist’s bias affecting  <br/>
&gt; the experiment’s results by implementing double blind procedures.<br/>
&gt;    * Publish the entire collection of photos for all water sample  <br/>
&gt; tests that he has performed, not just the ones that support his claim.<br/>
&gt;    * Minimize the sources of possible error in his procedures, such  <br/>
&gt; as variation in temperature and humidity between sample.<br/>
&gt;    * Pay more attention to the time-tested methods of the  <br/>
&gt; scientific community rather than disregarding them. Emoto’s  <br/>
&gt; research could go much farther if he could interest scientists  <br/>
&gt; around the world in testing his hypothesis.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; After the lengthy review of Emoto’s research methods and results, I  <br/>
&gt; have come to believe that Dr. Emoto is offering pseudoscience to  <br/>
&gt; the masses in the guise of defensible research. Only time and  <br/>
&gt; review by others will tell if there is any truth at the heart of  <br/>
&gt; Mr. Emoto’s claims, as Emoto himself thoroughly believes in his  <br/>
&gt; findings but does not value the scientific method or community.  <br/>
&gt; What is truly fearsome is the great numbers of people that accept  <br/>
&gt; his words as proven facts without looking deeper to find out if his  <br/>
&gt; claims are truly justified. While I respect Dr. Emoto’s desire to  <br/>
&gt; save the Earth’s water from contamination and pollution, unless he  <br/>
&gt; can produce a scientific paper and get it published in a scientific  <br/>
&gt; journal, I believe that he will continue to be ignored by the  <br/>
&gt; scientific community, and his claims will never be soundly proved  <br/>
&gt; or disproved&quot;<br/>

from something you&#39;ve said or the information is in response to a  <br/>
question you wrote.<br/>
<br/>
All discussions are about the principles and philosophy of radical  <br/>
unschooling. Discussions are intended to be for whoever wants to  <br/>
think about these ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Some parents do shame their kids about food without realizing it.  <br/>
When a parent is focused on the child understanding what the parent  <br/>
believes, they often don&#39;t realize how the words sound to the child.  <br/>
A child can feel ashamed about wanting what mom says is bad for him  <br/>
while the mom thinks she&#39;s just relaying truth.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re not doing that, then you can move onto something that does  <br/>
apply and will help you.<br/>
<br/>
Most people are used to personal discussions where the everything is  <br/>
meant specifically for them. The discussions here are different and  <br/>
take some getting used to.<br/>

They trust me to fill the &gt; house with healthy food and I do that!The discussion isn&#39;t about you, even if a discussion branches off from something you&#39;ve said or the information is in response to a question you wrote.All discussions are about the principles and philosophy of radical unschooling. Discussions are intended to be for whoever wants to think about these ideas.Some parents do shame their kids about food without realizing it. When a parent is focused on the child understanding what the parent believes, they often don&#39;t realize how the words sound to the child. A child can feel ashamed about wanting what mom says is bad for him while the mom thinks she&#39;s just relaying truth.If you&#39;re not doing that, then you can move onto something that does apply and will help you.Most people are used to personal discussions where the everything is meant specifically for them. The discussions here are different and take some getting used to.Joyce[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1830067680">I agree with your point here Ren. I just don&#39;t agree with stocking the house with food that I believe to be unhealthy just so my children have the choice to eat that food (if they never would have known about the food before I brought it into the house). Or if my child says he wants doritos, I might say &quot;would you consider this or this instead&quot; and let him choose without judgement. I would consider this informing instead of manipulating or restricting. I think that a lot of what our children are exposed to is because of us. As they get older they do have the increasing ability to make choices for themselves but initially we are the people exposing them to the possibilities. We can lay the initial groundwork and then they have the freedom to accept or deny. I personally think (and studies support this) that children are more likely to have health problems if the initial environment is unhealthy or the parents model an unhealthy lifestyle. Yet I also think that if you are overly restrictive or shaming in anyway, that it tends to &quot;backfire&quot; too. Kelli______________________<br/>

<br/>
If your kids have beliefs that are different than yours, and you&#39;re  <br/>

that&#39;s counter to the principles of the list.<br/>
<br/>
If your kids have beliefs that are different than yours, how do you  <br/>

you want them to go in insisting that you follow their beliefs and  <br/>
give up your own?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you&#39;re offering and the kids are saying &quot;Great!&quot;, then what&#39;s to  <br/>
discuss?<br/>
<br/>
How do you handle it when the kids want something other than what you  <br/>
want them to have?<br/>
<br/>
The answer for this list is to treat their want as seriously as you  <br/>
treat a want of your own (that doesn&#39;t involve imposing on others.)  <br/>
How do you treat yourself or your husband who wants something? You  <br/>
help them get it.<br/>
<br/>
What if they want something you feel is dangerous? Let&#39;s say a full  <br/>
size ATV. The answer would be to help them find some way to get the  <br/>
experience they want. Maybe there&#39;s something smaller. Maybe there&#39;s  <br/>
someone who would help them ride. With something that far out of my  <br/>
experience, I&#39;d ask on the list for ideas!<br/>
<br/>
If my child wanted Oreos, and I was into whole foods, I&#39;d explore the  <br/>
whole food options. Depending on the child and what she really  <br/>
wanted, we might do a taste test with brand name Oreos. I&#39;d talk  <br/>
about the ingredients in an informational way, saying &quot;These are the  <br/>
ingredients that make me prefer to buy organic,&quot; and I&#39;d talk about  <br/>
why. It would *not* be presented with the idea in the back of my  <br/>
mind, &quot;And that&#39;s why you should make the same choice.&quot; It&#39;s just  <br/>
information to help her choose. If the child decided Oreos were what  <br/>
she wanted, I&#39;d buy Oreos.<br/>
<br/>
I found it very helpful to show my daughter the ingredients on  <br/>
packages *I* was pondering over rather than on things she wanted. I  <br/>
pointed out the number of unpronounceable ingredients as the first  <br/>
step. And we&#39;ve added to the discussion since; she knows the  <br/>
difference between unpronounceable vitamins and weird chemicals. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Kids are pretty savvy! They know the difference between when we&#39;re  <br/>
trying to get them to believe as we do and when we&#39;re trusting that  <br/>
they&#39;re intelligent enough to use information to help them make  <br/>
decisions. They *won&#39;t* at the beginning, make the same decisions we  <br/>
do. The important part isn&#39;t to parrot the adults&#39; knowledge and do  <br/>
what the parent would do. The important part is to think and decide  <br/>
and reassess. It&#39;s a process. A child who knows they&#39;re free to have  <br/>
Oreos in an organic home is much more likely to embrace an organic  <br/>
lifestyle later in life than one who feels they must not have Oreos  <br/>
for various dire reasons.<br/>

I agree that it is a process and finding the underlying &quot;need&quot; and focusing on getting that need met is the most important thing. This may not be the same process for everyone across the board in unschooling.

It is an interesting point you are making about t.v. What about specific programs on tv? If a 5 year old child asked to watch SAW or a pornographic channel how would that discussion be handled? How would a child even know it exists at that age without the leadership of the parent? I guess it could be another parent or family....Kelli______________________<br/>

&gt; are more likely to have health problems if the initial environment is<br/>
&gt; unhealthy or the parents model an unhealthy lifestyle.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

gratitude or ingratitude, of acceptance or shame, of love or fear) that<br/>
contributes to the environment and the relationship.<br/>
It&#39;s not about meat, it&#39;s not about Doritos, it&#39;s about honor, trust and<br/>
respect within one&#39;s relationships.<br/>
