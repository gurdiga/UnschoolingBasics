<div id="ygrps-yiv-425269030">Sure Psm I agree with many of the things you are saying. I am not here to bash the Conference.<br/>
My point is that I really wanted to go.<br/>
Last year was the first year and their venue did not allow ( size wise) to have kids.<br/>
They have this new venue this year and one was really hoping that they could have a room for the kids. I am not asking for them to baby sit my kids. But they are not allowed this year again and I cannot help and feel.<br/>
sad I cannot make it. There is a group of unschoolers that get together about one hour and a half from me.<br/>
I wanted to connect with more unschoolers and  well, maybe I just wanted me and my kids to feel the way we did at your Conference ( L and L).<br/>
It was so nice to be there that my 5 year old keeps asking when we are going to go back almost every week.<br/>
And as I said. I hope they can find a way to allow kids next year but I cannot help that I am sad I will not be able to go this year.<br/>
The funny part is that apparently most people going to the Conference last year would rather stay this way as someone posted earlier.<br/>
So it seems that I am a minority that wants to have her kids with her.<br/>
And again Pam Thank you for all the work you guys do at L and L. It was really appreciated.<br/>
Alex<br/>

<br/>
I agree, and I&#39;m really, really not trying to hurt feelings at ALL. I know <br/>
how it feels when it SEEMS as if you are being left out. I&#39;m 38 and have been a <br/>
mom for over 20 years. I&#39;ve been &quot;left out&quot; of many, many things due to having <br/>
the kids and not having childcare (single parenting, workaholic DHs, no <br/>
money) and it feels awful. But I&#39;ve seen that sometimes, it feels like a personal <br/>
affront, but in actuality, it fits the needs of a larger group. An intense <br/>
single day conference might really be one of those ways that we as moms (and for <br/>
the most part, SAHMs) can care for ourselves and talk *about* our children and <br/>
how we have opted to raise them.   I bet most of us don&#39;t talk ABOUT them with <br/>
them in the room - we include them. But all adults? And adults that are along <br/>
the same lines as we are re: education, school and life? Were we might get a <br/>
chance to discuss our fears in person (emails are great, but not the same) and <br/>
also our wonderful times, too. I see both &quot;sides&quot; here, but are needed. And <br/>
its easy for me to disccuss it since I have NO possibility of going - with or <br/>
without the kids. <br/>
<br/>
I hope all is resolved however, I really do. I love this lost and hope the <br/>
discord is all over soon.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The recent ARGH gathering here in Eastern TN waas just that. We had a<br/>
gathering where we all shared various interests, discussed unschooling<br/>
and played. It was small and opened a lot of doors for future<br/>
gatherings, new ideas and new friendships. We&#39;ll be hosting it twice<br/>
per year now and it&#39;s very exciting to be a part of something new.<br/>
<br/>
I see the benefits of attending events for adults only, I truly do<br/>
(because I can focus on what *I* need and not worry about anyone<br/>
else). But I really think that in unschooling circles you will hugely<br/>
limit your attendee base if you don&#39;t host something geared for all ages.<br/>

<br/>
I know the conference folks are aware of the quandary of kids attending, I&#39;m<br/>
certain there are folks in Madison (and in a Madison driving range) who<br/>
would jump at the chance to have a kid friendly gathering to share their<br/>
unschooling journeys. Non-Con gatherings are amazing! Ask Mary Gold: If you<br/>
Plan it We will Come -- SO true :D We&#39;ve had two in Corvallis, we&#39;re<br/>
planning another near Seattle for Marti Gras, probably one in Canada this<br/>
summer (that&#39;s in addition to having LIFE is Good in between :D)... just<br/>
gatherings of families, opportunities to witness and support and play and<br/>
chase and laugh and sing and share and hug and all of that wonderful Tribal<br/>
Gathering schtuff we miss so much when we don&#39;t get enough. Have you thought<br/>
about possibly driving to the one in Ohio next month? It&#39;s at a waterpark :D<br/>
<br/>
And for anyone who has yet to gather with unschoolers, check out my blog for<br/>
non-con posts (and links to other blogs, too) We had such a great time! We<br/>
*HAVE* such a great time every time we meet, it is a stretching, learning,<br/>
joyous experience for us all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1300428941">Another option would be to do it like the Conference they had in Minneapolis ( Sandra was the main speaker) in the end of last September where they did not allow kids either but the venue was adjacent to a big park ( indoor with things for all ages),<br/>
That way you could bring someone to be with your kids playing but you are right there if they need you.<br/>
Madison is a great town and people there are extremely friendly.<br/>
Downtown right next to the Capitol Building ( that is absolutely a must to go visit) there are at leat 3 museums including the Children&#39;s Museum, several hotels, great little shops and places to eat all within walking distance ( really close).<br/>
That may be an option so to them. I know that I have stayed in a hotel right there when dd whas 9 months old and ds 4 and we had a blast walking everywhere. They did have Conference rooms there. I should go ahead and send them an e-mail....<br/>
Alex ( who really just wish she could go but also wished her kids go have fun with other unschoolers too!)<br/>
