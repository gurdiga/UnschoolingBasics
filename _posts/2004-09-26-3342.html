<div id="ygrps-yiv-1418895563">&quot;But, definitely I <br/>
can see how the opportunity to talk without the distractions of kids <br/>
would be beneficial, too.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I agree.<br/>
BUT, the groups I was part of that had a regular monthly meeting was definitely NOT unschoolers. Usually, if a group needs to have a planning meeting, it&#39;s all about structured activities. That wouldn&#39;t be so bad if it was just fun outings being planned, but usually it&#39;s lessonish/schoolish kind of stuff...but not always.<br/>
The key for me, would be what kind of group it was.<br/>
Our group gets together weekly and we never have planning meetings. We don&#39;t really need them seeing as we&#39;re very relaxed. I would love to get together with some of the adults once in a while, just to chat without distractions, but several of us are working outside the home, so we don&#39;t want to spend time away from our families for something other than work.<br/>
Find out what the meetings are about. If it&#39;s all curriculum oriented, you probably won&#39;t like it. If they&#39;re just planning some fun outings, it might work for an unschooler.<br/>
