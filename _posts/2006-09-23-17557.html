<div id="ygrps-yiv-194703735">OH! I just understood something! I always wondered about this &quot;watch  <br/>
TV with your children to see what interests them&quot; – I thought it was  <br/>
just about what interests them on *TV* – Now (reading on Joyce  <br/>
Fetteroll&#39;s site) I got it (I think), it&#39;s about seeing what  <br/>
interests them *in general* to be able to suggest/do more interesting  <br/>
things! Duh!<br/>

Greetings<br/>
