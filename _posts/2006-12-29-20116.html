<div id="ygrps-yiv-884537891">I have found that the bean-a-day strategy was helpful with this. Get a large crockpot, either at a yard sale or thrift shop (or request one as a gift), and make a daily habit of making beans and greens. If you buy dry beans which is super cheap, soak them with some lemon juice or whey until they just sprout- at least 24 hours, they will be more easily digested and assimilated and also more nutritious. Crockpot soaked beans with broth (homeade broth is easily and cheaply made from edges, peelings and other food parts you don&#39;t normally eat- just designate a container for collecting broth additions in the fridge) and food processor greens and herbs of various types(kids don&#39;t notice them at all this way) overnight and the next day you have a bean dish people can snack on, pack up and take along or what have you. You can puree leftovers into bean dip to serve with chips or roll into burritos.<br/>
I also recommend a rice (or grain) cooker. Get to know Amaranth, quinoa, millett and buckwheat as well as rice, and make a habit of keeping a big cooked pot of these around for reheating beans with and so forth. Quinoa is high in protein, and several of the above listed grains are actually seeds, and not technically grains.<br/>
We don&#39;t do dry cereal for breakfast- too expensive. We make hot cereal porrdiges in the mornings, or cold ones by mixing up homeade granola or muesli and then soaking it overnight. We keep yogurt around for snacking- add seeds, fruit, nuts, maple syrup etc.. or use as sour cream in burritos and such. We drink water, rarely juice and when we do we dilute it a lot. Herb teas- especially fruit ones- work as well and are cheaper. <br/>
I also use the muffin trick. We use half almond flour so they have more bang for the buck, and mini muffin tins to encourage folks to wait and see how big a snack they really need. These prep fast, cook fast and keep well in the freezer even. Grate zucchini and carrot into them for more veggies.<br/>
We do some shopping at trader joes, some at whole foods, but most through a bulk buying food co-op. Most communities have one, and you can save a lot by buying in bulk and through co-op&#39;s. <br/>
<br/>
I also wanted to mention WIC, Women Infants and Children. This is available to families who earn middle class incomes as well, depending on family size and covers pregnant and nursing mothers and children under five. It provides breakfast cereal, juice, milk, cheese, eggs, beans or peanut butter and the best part- farmers market coupons june through october. The food in the program is donated by coporate america, and is food that otherwise gets thrown away when not purchased- that&#39;s why the selections are so specific. But we get cheerios (63 oz), RgBH free milk (6 gallons) and cheese (8 pounds), commercial eggs (I make into quiche and use in muffins)(3 doz) beans (2 pounds), juice (8 cans of frozen concentrate or shelf stable) and about 10 bucks a week for produce at the farmers market in the season. This is for two kids. It can be a hassle to get it set up, but you only have to go back with the kids twice a year. I find it makes a big difference and allows me to put more money toward produce my kids will eat. I have a friend whose family income is in the 40&#39;s and they qualify, so check it out. I think a lot of families assume they won&#39;t qualify when they do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1943344977">I&#39;ve enjoyed the ideas for saving grocery money -- one of my goals in the coming year is to bring our grocery bill down, while also going organic and homemade, so we don&#39;t sacrifice health for cost.  I&#39;m glad this topic came up when it did.<br/>

   <br/>
  In my experience, WIC can be an even bigger hassle to keep up.  In theory, you only have to go twice a year -- unless your breastfeeding 18 mo tests &#39;low&#39; for iron.  Then you have to go more often and be subjected to continued &quot;suggestions&quot; (in the form of threatening insistence) that you try iron supplements (totally unnecessary for a healthy breastfed toddler).  And those check-up visits involve heel-stabs to take iron levels in your under five-yo kids. For me, the intrusion and complete disregard for Dan&#39;s right to his own bodily integrity were too high a price for generic, chemical-laden grocery store foods. <br/>

I just add 2 tbspns of lemon juice to the crock pot of water and <br/>

the water during soaking and they still come out fine. Of course, use <br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; my sister and I decided it wasn&#39;t worth it to have to put up with <br/>
&gt; her.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>WIC can be a hassle for sure. I think that if you aren&#39;t truly <br/>
struggling financially then it probably will seem like too much work. <br/>
But the food amounts to roughly $100/month for two children, and when <br/>
I was pregnant and nursing even more. That is substantial for a lot <br/>
of us struggling to provide healthy diets. I think that combined with <br/>
a lot of the other strategies people outlined it can be a huge assett <br/>
to many lower and middle income families especially ones whose <br/>
finances cause a painful stretching of money toward the end of the <br/>
month, or even unexpected lapses in food money for a week or two. <br/>
There were times in my pregnancy with my second that WIC food was the <br/>
only food I had to eat for several days or at one time two weeks <br/>
because of wait times being paid for jobs and so forth. <br/>
One of the ways we have used the benefits to help, is that in reality <br/>
dh eats pretty basic conventional food. He likes breakfast cereal, <br/>
drinks milk, canned juice, peanut butter, eggs and cheese. So when we <br/>
didn&#39;t need the food in the house, these foods went to work with him. <br/>
The money we saved in his food while away from home went into the <br/>
kids higher quality food. Smaller bodies need more careful <br/>
considerations to hormones and such. Obviously we would have <br/>
preferred everyone have an organic diet, but in the hierarchy of need <br/>
he was more than willing to eat conventional eggs so the kids could <br/>
have hormone free ones. <br/>
The idea behind the program is to allow families to spend more of <br/>
their food budget on produce and other nutritious foods by giving <br/>
away higher priced staples that are normally thrown away when <br/>
overproduced. Any way you accomplish that goal by putting the food to <br/>
use makes sense to me ethically.<br/>
I make quiche with WIC food and that uses up a lot of the milk eggs <br/>
and cheese plus organic veggies, split pea soup with the bean <br/>
alottment and when I was getting them, the carrotts, and we buy the <br/>
frozen juice concentrate to use as a sweetner for desserts and breads <br/>
which is a healthy alternative to sugar. I also get the orange- <br/>
pineapple which my kids love and we try and save it for high vit-c <br/>
needs.  I have found a store that lets me use WIC checks for a brand <br/>
of local milk that doesn&#39;t use hormones, and we buy Cabot cheese with <br/>
WIC. I feel similarly about the hormone issue, but have found a place <br/>
for WIC in my own life that is balanced. If it allows me to keep my <br/>
kids home more, their diet is most definately going to be better than <br/>
if they spent their days in an institutional setting. I&#39;m not <br/>
sweating that the cheerios and instant oatmeal aren&#39;t organic. Using <br/>
WIC allows me to buy 80% of our total diet organically.<br/>
<br/>
With WIC and other kinds of social services, it helps to believe you <br/>
and your kids deserve this. The jobs involved in administering social <br/>
services whether they are veterans benefits, disability benefits, <br/>
chidcare subsidies or WIC basically suck. They are low paying, many <br/>
employees also receive these benefits due to their low wages, provide <br/>
little chance for education or advancement and involve a high level <br/>
of personal interaction with clients who can be irritable, nasty and <br/>
sometimes violent. I try and cut them as much slack as possible <br/>
because I worked their side of the table many years ago. You have <br/>
rights. You can report nasty or abusive behavior. I they threaten you <br/>
or are rude ask for their supervisors information. You do not have to <br/>
have them do the physical assessment. My family doc faxes them a form <br/>
twice a year saying all is well. The form is blue and is a medical <br/>
verification form. All WIC offices take it. Most docs who are <br/>
supportive of us non-vaxing types are more than happy to fax a form <br/>
so your kid can get WIC. I have been &quot;forgetting&quot; to bring my vax <br/>
records for four years. It hasn&#39;t been a problem. Once, when we <br/>
couldn&#39;t get the form faxed, I gave alistair a choice and he said he <br/>
didn&#39;t want the finger stick. I told the woman &quot;we both know it isn&#39;t <br/>
necessary, but if you need to withold food from him, which is more <br/>
likely to cause him anemia, then I understand that&#39;s what you have to <br/>
do, but I won&#39;t restrain him for this test.&quot; and she agreed it was <br/>
stupid and gave him the checks anyway. I was polite and friendly. <br/>
ownership doesn&#39;t mean being nasty or egotistical, just clear that <br/>
you qualify for the benefit and your kids deserve their share. <br/>
Realistically, it takes me about 4 hours a year to get $1200 worth of <br/>
food. That&#39;s $300/hr and well worth the time to me!<br/>
coming soon, my zine all about wic...<br/>
