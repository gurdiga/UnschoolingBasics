<div id="ygrps-yiv-710007402">Hello Everyone,<br/>
I rarely post here, but I get a lot out of reading. I know this is not a &quot;support&quot; group so please redirect if you have another suggestion. <br/>
We just returned from the NEUC on Sun. nite. This was our 5th conference in 2 years. Usually I return feeling exhausted but rejuvenated with my parenting skills. This time I returned feeling exhausted, restless, angry, and all stirred up inside. It feels like my inner teenager is all pissed off about something. <br/>
Just curious if any of you other conference goers experienced this type of reaction. The past few days have been hard to parent when I am in angry teenager mode. Just trying to be gentle with myself and trust the process. It could just be lack of sleep and not eating my regular mostly raw organic foods.<br/>

That could be. I was out-of-sorts after getting back from my recent trip to visit family. It was a good trip, but I think the steady diet of pasta (vegetarians visiting non-vegetarians) had me ready for some more solid nutrition.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I wonder if the conferencing is needing to slow down? I came to a point where conferences are mostly overwhelming for me so I only went to one last year and will most likely go to zero next year. Only small, localish stuff. Needs change. Maybe this is a chance to re-direct?<br/>
<br/>
I could be totally off-base, but I think there are different times in our lives where going outward feels really good and then times when we need to go inward more. I&#39;ve felt less and less invigorated by conferences and more overwhelmed and exhausted. I think part of that may stem from having an amazing group of local friends and lots of opportunities for smaller get-togethers.<br/>

Thank you for your feedback. I am feeling much better today. It&#39;s amazing what a lot of sleep, sunshine, and raw food can do. <br/>
I am definitely going to rethink the conference going. Ren, I appreciate hearing how they have affected you. It helps to validate how I have been feeling. I think they are also too overwhelming for my youngest who is 7. He loves being home. He got pretty melty toward the end and I was having a hard time dealing with it because of my own meltiness.<br/>
Kindest regards,<br/>
