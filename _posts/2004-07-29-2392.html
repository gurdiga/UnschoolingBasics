<div id="ygrps-yiv-363789872">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I just discovered this group.  I have a 9.5 yodd and we&#39;re starting our fourth year <br/>
homeschooling.  Dd is very kinesthetic and lives in the moment, while I am a list maker, <br/>
and follow the list.  I think she would be happier if our &quot;schooling&quot; were less structured.  <br/>
We go on lots of field trips, play lots of games, etc., but I am intrigued by the idea of child <br/>
led learning, and want her to be able to enjoy the benefit of homeschooling of being able <br/>
to follow her passions now instead of waiting until she&#39;s grown up.  At the same time, she <br/>
avoids any kind of language arts activities.  We&#39;ve been through vision therapy, so the <br/>
physical issues she had that made reading and writing difficult are resolved, but she still <br/>
doesn&#39;t like those activities.  My biggest concern with a less structured approach to <br/>
homeschooling is that she&#39;ll never learn to read or spell.  There are so many ways to avoid <br/>
those things -- books on tape, TV/videos, etc. that she could be very functional for a long <br/>
time without &quot;needing&quot; to read. <br/>
<br/>
Any feedback would be appreciated.  If this topic of &quot;how to be sure your child will learn <br/>
what s/he needs to learn&quot; has been discussed recently, just point me to the archives.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
Anne.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1526393378">&lt;&lt;&lt;At the same time, she <br/>
avoids any kind of language arts activities.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is school speak. Do you mean that your daughter doesn&#39;t speak or listen<br/>
or engage in conversations or watch movies or listen to the lyrics of songs<br/>
or talk on the phone or express her opinions or draw pictures which have a<br/>
story to them or tell you stories or listen to you reading to her or ask<br/>
questions.....? <br/>
<br/>
Of course she likely does most or all of these things. I mention all this<br/>
because I strongly suspect that you are separating educational activities<br/>
from life, and thinking in terms of school subjects and some on paper method<br/>
of proving that your dd has learnt some skill - outside of living it. A<br/>
journey towards Unschooling means letting go of these limiting definitions. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;We&#39;ve been through vision therapy, so the <br/>
physical issues she had that made reading and writing difficult are<br/>
resolved, but she still <br/>
doesn&#39;t like those activities. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Trying to force whatever these activities are on her in even a gentle way<br/>
shows her that you have an agenda for her learning timetable. Worse, it<br/>
continues to reinforce that she has some kind of lack in your eyes. You are<br/>
defining her in terms of her difficulties by seeking to address them<br/>
specifically.<br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt;&lt;My biggest concern with a less structured approach to <br/>
homeschooling is that she&#39;ll never learn to read or spell.  There are so<br/>
many ways to avoid <br/>
those things -- books on tape, TV/videos, etc. that she could be very<br/>
functional for a long <br/>
time without &quot;needing&quot; to read.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So exult and rejoice that she can revel in the immense cultural offerings<br/>
available to her, and know that she will learn to read in her own time.<br/>
There was an article about &quot;late&quot; readers on the www.unschooling.com website<br/>
- recently featured - something about &quot;Now I can breathe again...&quot; <br/>
<br/>
When I read the phrase &quot;be very functional&quot; I hear a parent who is still<br/>
invested in schoolthink. It is so clinical sounding, and may be a leftover<br/>
from the therapies that you were part of. How about using the phrase &quot;enjoy<br/>
a lot of cool stuff&quot; instead?   <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Any feedback would be appreciated.  If this topic of &quot;how to be sure your<br/>
child will learn <br/>
what s/he needs to learn&quot; has been discussed recently, just point me to the<br/>
archives.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is the only way that you can be *sure* that your child learns<br/>
what *they* need to learn, because that&#39;s kinda the definition of it. All<br/>
they do all day is learn what they *need* for the activities that interest<br/>
them, sometimes asking for assistance. I think you are mixing up what *they<br/>
really, genuinely, individually need* with what school (the dominant<br/>
ideology) tells you they need - often spurious. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling helps my family live mindfully in the present, without worrying<br/>
about future *needs*. Two days ago Jayn (4.75) wrote her name for the first<br/>
time to sign a piece of artwork. Tonight she suddenly recited our phone<br/>
number - I didn&#39;t know she had ever heard it. She is interested in being<br/>
able to label her work, and she is also very interested in telephones.<br/>

There have been threads on writing and handwriting here and on<br/>
UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com recently, since you mentioned writing<br/>
earlier.<br/>

They *may* be resolved in YOUR mind, but not hers. That&#39;s probably why  she&#39;s <br/>
not yet interested. She needs to heal from all that time in therapy. Take  a <br/>

Do you REALLY think a child will never learn to read or spell? Really? A  <br/>
child who is surrounded by the written word, who sees her parents read joyfully,  <br/>
who is ready to read? <br/>
 <br/>
For probably 10-14 months, you functioned quite well not knowing how  to <br/>
walk, but you did it! For 15-16 years, you functioned quite well  not knowing how <br/>
to drive, but you did it. So many years with knowing how to  cook, to clean, <br/>
to swim, to knit, to .... &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
She&#39;ll function quite well until she actually feels the need to learn. Then  <br/>
she&#39;ll do it. We promise!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2118923091">Hi,<br/>
I&#39;m Susan SAHM-WAHM to two boys 5 1/2 and 2 1/2. I&#39;m hoping to unschool them. My oldest &quot;should have&quot; started kindergarten last September but we &quot;held him back&quot; since he was a November baby. Really I was stalling and dh thought he was too still too young. Now another September approaches...<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve been reading through the posts here and several other unschooling and Radical Unschooling sites. The unschooling philosophies of what are considered the traditional subject areas I have no problem with. It simply makes sense to me that through play and curiosity (and I have two very curious ones!) they will learn far more than they could sitting in a classroom being forced to follow a regime that has nothing to do with their own hourly, daily, seasonal or you-name-it clock.<br/>
 <br/>
Buuuuuut...what I am mystified and unclear about is the discussion on limits and rules. Okay, I have come across the comment &quot;arbitrary&quot; rules but still I&#39;m not quite comfortable. I&#39;d love to hear what some of you have to say on the following topics.<br/>
 <br/>
Food. As I mentioned my children are 2 and 5. I never tell them how much to eat or that they have to eat. I put a little of everything we&#39;re serving on their plate and they eat what they feel like from the plate. My oldest boy has not eaten fish (knowingly) for at least a year. But it is on his plate if that is what we have cooked - he doesn&#39;t have to eat it. There are always a few other things on the plate too. He did the same thing with red meat for about a year. And with no pride lost or anything else, since no comment was ever made about his choice to leave it, he started eating it again recently. But we don&#39;t have junk or processed food in the house, in fact we hardly have any packaged food in the house. We pretty well eat organic whole foods and that&#39;s it. My husband and I have been eating that way since long before we had kids. My feeling is that many of the ingredients in foods today are not food at all and are actually harmful. We have many chemicals allowed in our<br/>
 &quot;foods&quot; that are already banned in other countries. Soooo if someday we are in a store and one of my children asks me to buy something with a mile-long list of ingredients on it how can I not say, &quot;Sorry, honey.&quot;? Any more so than someone else might say their ten year-old can not try marijuana. So is this considered an arbitrary limit?<br/>
 <br/>
It seems to me that foods with high sugar levels, fast foods like McDonald&#39;s foods etc. are actually addictive. So if your child starts in on it at a young age and a parent says &quot;yes&quot; whenever they request it, they could easily become addicted to junk food. I do have a nephew who has never had limits on food and the only &quot;restaurant&quot; he will eat in is McDonald&#39;s and he does eat there several times a week (yes, I will concede that the family modelling is a little lacking in this case). With obesity, ADHD, and diabetes levels where they currently are and are heading, isn&#39;t this somewhere that we need to do a little bit more than just modelling?<br/>
 <br/>
T.V. At what age do you allow your children complete control over what they watch? Let&#39;s face it, there is some pretty offensive stuff on television. Are the unlimited television comments for teens or small children as well? I feel half of what&#39;s on T.V. would actually terrify my kids. And even for somewhat older kids, how often are they mature enough to not be seduced by the allure of just how cool and how perfect half the T.V. characters are? Would it be okay to let a foul-mouthed, sick minded person sit down and have an extensive conversation with a child? Is this not what we sometimes invite into our homes when we let a child watch anything they want?<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;d love to hear thoughts on this! I can be convinced otherwise! I simply need to understand the reasoning here. They unschooling parents whose thoughts I&#39;ve been reading are obviously loving, kind, thoughtful intelligent parents and this is why I am asking.<br/>
 <br/>
Warm regards,<br/>
Susan<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-729597899">Unschooling comes from the foundation belief that learning happens, like <br/>
breathing, like growing, like death and taxes, it is a part of being alive, <br/>
a part of being human. As you watch your two grow and learn and talk and <br/>
walk and breathe you realize that they are thinking, creative, people. You <br/>
also begin to trust them. You trust that the relationship they are creating <br/>
with the world around them is an informed relationship, a relationship that <br/>
exists, not within a vacuum, but with their tastes and opinions and values. <br/>
You trust that because they are thinking, interesting, respected individuals <br/>
they will not fall prey to those things that are looking for needy, <br/>
reactive, scared people to take advantage of. And I think it is that kind of <br/>
relationship, that kind of parent-child interaction that leads to radical <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I know that television isn&#39;t scary. I know, from absolute first hand <br/>
experience that my 10 year old doesn&#39;t want to see scary or sexual things. <br/>
He just doesn&#39;t. I know that he might change his mind someday, but right <br/>
now, those things are too intense and too much for him to watch, even <br/>
cuddled up in my arms. And they don&#39;t appeal. I like watching Doctor Who, <br/>
and usually Simon watches with me, but the last week&#39;s episode had a huge <br/>
tense moment with people being attacked by these reverse Medusa beings who <br/>
turn into stone when they are seen, but if you blink... Anyhow, both he and <br/>
Linnaea (7) wanted me to change the channel, so I did. They didn&#39;t want to <br/>
be scared, they didn&#39;t like the tension. They got to dictate their own <br/>
relationship with a scary show.<br/>
<br/>
I know that food isn&#39;t an issue. I know that because they can have any food <br/>
they want, and what they want is food that is varied and interesting to <br/>
them. Linnaea&#39;s favorite food is an Ethiopian peanut wat and she loves nori <br/>
and when we ate at an amazing south Indian restaurant in London earlier this <br/>
week, she and Simon happily ate dosas and drank laasis. Simon loves bean and <br/>
cheese burritos and this morning, when there were many and varied chips and <br/>
chocolates and I could have easily done up some french fries or any of these <br/>
other things, he chose to make eggy bread (British French toast without <br/>
syrup) which got Linnaea excited so she made some and they both enjoyed it <br/>
immensely. I also know that Linnaea likes chips and ice cream and chocolate <br/>
and Simon likes bubble gum and ginger ale and bbq flavored pringles, so we <br/>
have those things around too. But when we went to a friend&#39;s yard for a <br/>
campout on Saturday to which we brought digestive biscuits (the closest <br/>
things to graham crackers I can find in the UK), chocolate bars and <br/>
marshmallows. I showed all the Brit kids how to make s&#39;mores. Many of them <br/>
devoured them, but my two, who have access to all kinds of foods, ate a few <br/>
bites and handed them back. They wanted the experience but didn&#39;t need the <br/>
overwhelming sweetness. For them food has no association with reward or <br/>
punishment or with scarcity. And Linnaea was quite reticent to even join in <br/>
as she doesn&#39;t eat meat and the marshmallows we can get here all have beef <br/>
gelatine in them. She chose to take a bite, and chose not to finish the <br/>
s&#39;more. It wasn&#39;t so tempting that she had to walk to far beyond her ethical <br/>
decisions. And what she eats is her choice. She&#39;s given up her favorite <br/>
chocolate since they decided to start using rennet. That is her decision, <br/>
not me handing down my ethics. I&#39;m an omnivore, never been a vegetarian, it <br/>
isn&#39;t a moral issue for me.<br/>
<br/>
There are some wonderful things that have been written and collected and put <br/>
up for others to read about food choices and television choices at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.joyfullyrejoycing.com/">http://www.joyfullyrejoycing.com/</a> (about 2/3rds of the way down in the left <br/>
hand column) and at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/tv">http://sandradodd.com/tv</a> oh, and if you want to read <br/>
something about how limiting access to something can make it that much more <br/>
valuable read Pam&#39;s response here: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sandradodd.com/t/economics.html">http://www.sandradodd.com/t/economics.html</a> . I&#39;m sure there are others. This <br/>
is sort of the core set of questions when people come to thinking about <br/>
unschooling, it is often the largest boogeyman in a parent&#39;s perspective on <br/>
the dangers of raising a child. But really, television isn&#39;t scary, it can <br/>
open up so much of the world and lead to the most amazing questions. As can <br/>
food.<br/>

Would he get sick? What if he ate it twice? What if he ate it ten times?<br/>
<br/>
What would happen to your relationship if you said no? Think about  <br/>
how you would feel if your husband said no to what you felt was a  <br/>
reasonable request with an explanation that he felt was reasonable  <br/>
but you felt was off?<br/>
<br/>
When we put fences around things, those things become more  <br/>
attractive. *Do* you want Oreos to be something put on a pedestal as  <br/>
a forbidden food to be indulged in only when the parents aren&#39;t looking.<br/>
<br/>
No does far more damage than a whole bag of Oreos.<br/>
<br/>
But just because we don&#39;t say no, doesn&#39;t mean we never discuss  <br/>
nutrition. *Trust* your children to explore and be able to find their  <br/>
own answers. Otherwise what you&#39;re doing is putting them in a box to  <br/>
memorize your answers.<br/>

unschooling families?<br/>
<br/>
While my daughter did for a while like McDonalds, during the  <br/>
prepubescent years when she was growing out in preparation for  <br/>
growing up, she rarely eats it now. If it were addictive, she would  <br/>
show signs of it today. She doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s more going on in people choosing McDonalds than addiction. It  <br/>
would be comforting to believe that. We could solve obesity by never  <br/>
letting a Big Mac past our lips ;-) But it&#39;s not that simple.<br/>

<br/>
Buuuuuut...what I am mystified and unclear about is the discussion on <br/>
limits and<br/>
rules. Okay, I have come across the comment &quot;arbitrary&quot; rules but still <br/>
I&#39;m not<br/>
quite comfortable. I&#39;d love to hear what some of you have to say on the<br/>
following topics.<br/>
<br/>
Food. &lt;snip&gt; My husband and I have been eating that way since long <br/>
before we had kids. My feeling is that<br/>
many of the ingredients in foods today are not food at all and are <br/>
actually<br/>
harmful. We have many chemicals allowed in our<br/>
  &quot;foods&quot; that are already banned in other countries. Soooo if someday <br/>
we are in<br/>
a store and one of my children asks me to buy something with a <br/>
mile-long list of<br/>
ingredients on it how can I not say, &quot;Sorry, honey.&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Again, I&#39;ve been away from the computer, so I apologize for my delay.<br/>
<br/>
At what age, do you think, would that &quot;Sorry, honey&quot; no longer work? <br/>
And do you plan to keep your children in your home, following your <br/>
rules about food, forever?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s different when they are really little, but as soon as they start <br/>
visiting others withOUT your food limits, what do you think they will <br/>
do? Do you think they will stay away from Pringles and Oreos? Or do you <br/>
think they will *try* one? If they *do* try one and LIKE it...what <br/>
then? Will they be denied what they like? Will they be shamed about <br/>
their tastes? Will they feel guilty? Will they seek these forbidden <br/>
foods and sneak around to get them? Will they be forced to lie to you <br/>
to get what they want?<br/>
<br/>
What do *you* think will happen?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Any more so than someone else might say their ten year-old can not try <br/>
marijuana. So is this considered<br/>
an arbitrary limit?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Equating a Snickers bar with marijuana is silly. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But you said ten year old, so...<br/>
<br/>
At what age *would* it be OK for a person to try marijuana? Eleven? <br/>
Fifteen? Thirty-two? How about that Snickers bar? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
At almost 47, I&#39;ve never smoked it, by choice. But my 19 year old son <br/>
has. Do you think I could have stopped him? Do you think I could now? <br/>
How?<br/>
<br/>
Same with the Snickers bar---how long, do you think, do you have <br/>
control over what they do/eat/smoke?<br/>
<br/>
What will you do when they decide thay want to do/eat/smoke something <br/>
you disapprove of? Forbid it? How do you think that&#39;ll work? And what <br/>
will be the outcome of THAT?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that foods with high sugar levels, fast foods like <br/>
McDonald&#39;s<br/>
foods etc. are actually addictive. So if your child starts in on it at <br/>
a young<br/>
age and a parent says &quot;yes&quot; whenever they request it, they could easily <br/>
become<br/>
addicted to junk food. I do have a nephew who has never had limits on <br/>
food and<br/>
the only &quot;restaurant&quot; he will eat in is McDonald&#39;s and he does eat <br/>
there several<br/>
times a week (yes, I will concede that the family modelling is a little <br/>
lacking<br/>
in this case). With obesity, ADHD, and diabetes levels where they <br/>
currently are<br/>
and are heading, isn&#39;t this somewhere that we need to do a little bit <br/>
more than<br/>
just modelling?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
My husband used to freak out that I would take Cameron (as a little <br/>
tyke) to McDonald&#39;s almost whenever he asked. He LOVED French <br/>
fries---and the toys! &lt;G&gt; He&#39;s now 19 and (again) a vegetarian. He only <br/>
drinks water. He monitors every thing that goes into his body. He eats <br/>
very little, if any, packaged food, and cooks up a storm. Addicted?<br/>
<br/>
My other son, Duncan, is now 11. I would also take him to McDonald&#39;s <br/>
almost whenever he asked. You couldn&#39;t MAKE him walk in the place now. <br/>
His favorite restaurants are Sakura, McAllister&#39;s, Hooligan&#39;s, and <br/>
Panera. Addicted?<br/>
<br/>
One of the things we would do IS model. If one of the boys wanted <br/>
McD&#39;s, I&#39;d go there; but then I would go to the place *I* found more <br/>
attractive. I wouldn&#39;t necessarily get a Big Mac (although I did on <br/>
occasion), but would opt for something better (in my opinion). If my <br/>
son asked why, I&#39;d tell him that I didn&#39;t want McD&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
And what would you suggest we do differently? Forbid certain foods? It <br/>
won&#39;t work. Well, it WILL when the children are young, but as soon as <br/>
they are not under your direct supervision, they *will* try other <br/>
things---the forbidden things---and we all know what happens with the <br/>
forbidden! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
T.V. At what age do you allow your children complete control over what <br/>
they<br/>
watch?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re 19 and 11---they&#39;ve always been able to watch anything. At 11, <br/>
Duncan still prefers to watch cartoons and animal shows. He also like <br/>
The Most Extreme, Mythbusters, and Good Eats (we all love Alton Brown. <br/>
&lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Cameron (19) watches Good Eats, Family Guy, South Park, and That 70s <br/>
Show. Nothing else (unless it&#39;s a movie that we&#39;ve all chosen to <br/>
watch). When he was littler, he watched cartoons---and that was about <br/>
it---we didn&#39;t have a zillion channels like now.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s face it, there is some pretty offensive stuff on television.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s face it, there are some pretty offensive BOOKS out there. Do you <br/>
want to limit books too? How would you go about that? Do you think a <br/>
child would choose to open Charles Dickens or Stephen King? Generally <br/>
they choose books with bright, colorful pages and few words.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Are the unlimited television comments for teens or small children as <br/>
well?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
They really are for both. But I&#39;ve yet to meet a small child who <br/>
*wants* to watch anything remotely offensive.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I feel half of what&#39;s on T.V. would actually terrify my kids.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
But I seriously doubt that they would CHOOSE to watch something that <br/>
would terrify them. Would *you*? Why should we think less of our kids?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And even for somewhat older kids, how often are they mature enough to <br/>
not be seduced by the allure of<br/>
just how cool and how perfect half the T.V. characters are?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re getting at here.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re worried about children&#39;s being &quot;seduced by the allure&quot; of &quot;cool <br/>
and perfect&quot; tv characters???<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Would it be okay to let a foul-mouthed, sick minded person sit down and <br/>
have an extensive<br/>
conversation with a child? Is this not what we sometimes invite into <br/>
our homes<br/>
when we let a child watch anything they want?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty foul-mouthed---and have been accused of being sick-minded on <br/>
more than one occasion (of course, Deb Lewis has ME beat! &lt;G&gt;). And I <br/>
have extensive conversations with my kids every day! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re assuming a child would WANT that. And you&#39;re assuming that a <br/>
child can&#39;t see straight through it even if he does want that.<br/>
<br/>
We had a thread here a while back. Sylvia was uncomfortable with her <br/>
sons&#39; watching Futurama and Family Guy. The language is crass. The <br/>
situations are sick. There&#39;s a lot a parent *could* be fearful of there.<br/>
<br/>
But our family watches these shows. None of us behave like that. (Well, <br/>
*I* have a potty mouth---but NOT because of those shows! &lt;G&gt;) My boys <br/>
are gentlemen and are very polite.<br/>
<br/>
We talk about the behaviours of the characters---and their language and <br/>
situations. Duncan yells at them for being so stupid! &lt;G&gt; They&#39;re <br/>
CARTOONS! And they&#39;re supposed to be stupid!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to hear thoughts on this! I can be convinced otherwise! I <br/>
simply need<br/>
to understand the reasoning here. They unschooling parents whose <br/>
thoughts I&#39;ve<br/>
been reading are obviously loving, kind, thoughtful intelligent parents <br/>
and this<br/>
is why I am asking.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
As the parent of very young children, you have a LOT of control right <br/>
now---of food and TV and situations and ---all sorts of stuff. You <br/>
*can* limit everything in their lives, and it seems ok.<br/>
<br/>
But as your children age, you lose control: moreso with the older child <br/>
than the younger (&#39;cause as the older learns new stuff, it makes it <br/>
harder to shelter/shield the younger from the cool, new things).  When <br/>
they start visiting others and are able to make their own choices <br/>
withOUT you around, you&#39;re assuming that they will stay true to your <br/>
beliefs/preferences.<br/>
<br/>
But they aren&#39;t you. I&#39;m guessing you probably didn&#39;t grow up with your <br/>
beliefs---but that you developed them by testing and research and <br/>
questioning and trying new things. They will need to do that too. By <br/>
LIVING your beliefs, you will model what you hold true and dear. That <br/>
may not end up being your children&#39;s truths, however! They need to <br/>
examine and explore their own worlds and come to their own conclusions.<br/>
<br/>
By limiting their worlds, you are not allowing them to make these <br/>
scientific observations. And that&#39;s what they ARE: scientific <br/>
explorations and experiments. They are testing their world---seeing how <br/>
things fit and what works for them. They won&#39;t choose to do dangerous <br/>
stuff. Children LIKE to be safe. But they also NEED to explore and <br/>
figure things out (which sometimes results in injury---BUT they&#39;ve <br/>
learned that, and that&#39;s extremely important!!!). Limitations don&#39;t <br/>
allow for that important growth and learning.<br/>
<br/>
TV and food limits don&#39;t allow a child to find out what he *really* <br/>
likes and dislikes. It allows *you* to make that decision *for* him. <br/>
What he learns is that you believe that he&#39;s not capable to make these <br/>
decisions for himself. The belief that you ARE a capable person (and <br/>
that your *parents* believe that you are capable---WOW!) is so <br/>
empowering! Children NEED that---and they deserve it!<br/>

*******************<br/>
<br/>
This is something to think about wrt food, too. Kids&#39; eating habits <br/>
will change in relation to growth and development, seasons, moods, <br/>
and overall health. One of the interesting things about not placing <br/>
arbitrary limits on food is you get to see this - and your kids get <br/>
to experience it directly. When they&#39;re little, you many have to <br/>
observe some of the patterns for them and point them out (or not, <br/>
some kids are pretty self-aware in this regard) but as they get <br/>
older, they become able to make decisions about what and when to eat <br/>
based on needs and wants, rather than &quot;shoulds&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve probably seen this already with the foods you are offering <br/>
them - but you&#39;re standing in the way of their &quot;play and curiosity&quot; <br/>
by not allowing them to try things that look interesting to them. <br/>
You&#39;re giving them mixed messages about learning. *Some* topics are <br/>
fine to explore to their hearts&#39; content, but not all - and you&#39;re <br/>
deciding which. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; T.V. At what age do you allow your children complete control over <br/>
&gt;what they watch?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m going to take you back to your own premise that children learn <br/>
by playing and following their curiosity at their own pace. It works <br/>
with tv, too. Just as you wouldn&#39;t leave your kids with a pile of <br/>
manipulatives and expect them to derive the laws of euclidian <br/>
geometry, you wouldn&#39;t leave your kids with the tv and expect them <br/>
to figure it all out on their own. You can help them play and <br/>
explore and support their journey. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Would it be okay to let a foul-mouthed, sick minded person sit down <br/>
&gt;and have an extensive conversation with a child? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Think about that from a different angle - would you *make* your <br/>
child stay in that situation? If someone is giving your kids the <br/>
willies, would you make them hang out with that person? Or would you <br/>
empower your child to leave that situation? Sometimes kids want to <br/>
explore less-than-ideal relationships, and that&#39;s tricky, but it <br/>
*is* possible to support their exploration in a way that leaves the <br/>
child feeling supported and empowered. That&#39;s much better than <br/>
saying &quot;no&quot; and having the child sneak off to persue the <br/>
relationship anyway. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;It simply makes sense to me that through play and curiosity (and I <br/>
&gt;have two very curious ones!) they will learn far more than they <br/>
&gt;could sitting in a classroom being forced to follow a regime that <br/>
&gt;has nothing to do with their own hourly, daily, seasonal or you-<br/>
&gt;name-it clock.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been thinking about the idea that kids &quot;need consistency&quot; and I <br/>
think this is one way that unschooling really supports that <br/>
particular theory. With unschooling, though, its more a consistency <br/>
of underlying principles, than being dogmatic about the nuts and <br/>
bolts of daily life. If we assume kids are thoughtful people, <br/>
though, that kind of consistency is really the more important. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-599046010">LOL on the whole McDonald&#39;s situation: when DH was a teen, had wheels<br/>
and a part time job, he&#39;d eat McD&#39;s morning, noon, and night whenever<br/>
possible. It was something that had been unavailable for a long time<br/>
(for family financial reasons). Jump forward to now, 20ish years later.<br/>
Eating any kind of fast food burger causes great gastro distress, the<br/>
fried ones even more than the &quot;flame broiled&quot; ones. DS, however, likes<br/>
BK cheeseburgers (he&#39;s 9 and refuses to eat at McD&#39;s even if they have<br/>
the better toy on occasion). So, when they want to get fast food, they<br/>
go to BK and DH gets a chicken sandwich or a salad. And we&#39;re all now<br/>
moving toward a more plant based eating pattern (though we do still ALL<br/>
love sushi, yes even my 9 yr old - sushi was his choice of a birthday<br/>
dinner).<br/>

they wanted toys from Mc D. I felt there was no reason to deny them the <br/>
