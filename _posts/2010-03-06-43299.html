<div id="ygrps-yiv-1210470675">Come join us this Summer for a gathering of unschoolers near Montreal, Quebec, Canada!<br/>
<br/>
From July 2nd to 7th (date to be confirmed Monday), a bunch of unschoolers will be getting together in a campground (rooms in building available for rent, as well as campsites) in the beautiful Oka national park, just 45 minutes from downtown Montreal, to laugh and play games and have long discussions and sit around campfires...  And to hang out in one of the most beautiful cities in North America, of course!  During the gathering, Montreal will even be hosting the International Jazz Festival (note that despite it&#39;s name, you can find a variety of different musical styles at this festival), which boasts a huge amount of high profile, and lesser known but very talented, musicians and musical acts, with a wealth of free concerts!  Montreal truly comes alive in the Summer, and it&#39;s a great time to visit the city.<br/>
