 </span></blockquote>I actually have started using two different terms than Unschooling and<br/>
Radical Unschooling.  The term I use to differentiate between Radical<br/>
Unschooling and other forms of &quot;unschooling&quot; is the term<br/>
&quot;Non-Curriculum Homeschooling&quot;  NCH is simply that.  It is home<br/>
educating your child while not using a formal curriculum and<br/>
approaching learning in a &quot;self discovery&quot; way.  RU encompasses the<br/>
freedom of learning into all aspects of life.  This includes such<br/>
controversial issues as freedom of food and sleep, freedom from<br/>
assigned chores and punitive discipline.  It&#39;s living a free and<br/>
joyful life, not just abandoning a curriculum track.  I know some<br/>
people who use NCH who are still very strict punitive disciplinarians,<br/>
control issues of food and sleep and are not living joyful fulfilled<br/>
lives.<br/>
<br/>
Our whole family is unschooling now, including the adults.<br/>

Thanks for giving this definition.  The way you described Radical <br/>
Unschooling is really what I&#39;ve always believed Unschooling to be.  <br/>
Imagine that, me radical!  :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I wish every parent was *at least* mindful and gentle.  We were at a<br/>
friend&#39;s house this past Friday night.  There was another mother there<br/>
with her 5yo daughter.  She was a bright sweet joyful child and how<br/>
she has retained that joy is beyond me!  Her mother had all these<br/>
rules and controlled everything that she did and ate.  The child had<br/>
to eat at the table and had 2 measured tablespoons of food on her<br/>
plate.  I am NOT kidding.  She ha 1 T of mac-n-cheese and 1 T of a<br/>
casserole.  The child ate it and was still hungry.  Asked for more.<br/>
&quot;No; that is all you need.  There is sufficient nutrients in what you<br/>
had to eat.&quot; (While the mother sat there eating a huge bowl of food!)<br/>
&quot;May I have a cookie?&quot;  LONG pause &quot;I suppose so, but you have to eat<br/>
it at the table.&quot;  (My kids were munching on a piece of bread in the<br/>
workshop while playing and watching tv.)  Later the child did a<br/>
cartwheel headfirst into a coffee table.  She was screaming.  It&#39;s<br/>
that &quot;I need my mommy I&#39;m in horrible pain and scared&quot; scream that<br/>
makes me drop everything I am doing and run to my child.  We had to<br/>
tell the mother THREE times that her child needed her.  Then the<br/>
mother barely held the child and only reprimanded her for doing<br/>
cartwheels in the house.  &quot;That&#39;s what you get for doing cartwheels<br/>
where they don&#39;t belong.  Next time you won&#39;t do that will you.&quot;  No<br/>
comfort, no compassion, no empathy for having a huge goose egg on her<br/>
head.  My heart yearned so badly for this child.  I wanted to grab her<br/>
from her mother and hold her and stroke her hair and kiss her forehead<br/>
and soothe her poor battered body and kiss her little tears away.  All<br/>
I kept thinking all evening was, &quot;I just wish she showed a little<br/>
gentleness and love towards this child.&quot;  All the reaction between<br/>
mother and child was clinical and sterile and reprimanding.  :-(<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, I&#39;ve just had another miserable weekend with friends who <br/>
traditionally parent.  I could not get over the number of times I <br/>
heard the parents verbally tearing down their children.  There was <br/>
this constant message that their children were not measuring up.  <br/>
These are just some of the things I heard.  &quot;Why is it that other <br/>
people&#39;s children do what I tell them, but _my_ own children never do <br/>
what I tell them to?&quot;  Or... &quot;She&#39;s just a space case.  She&#39;s eleven; <br/>
she should be able to clean her own room. We&#39;re being stricter now and <br/>
withholding her privileges when she doesn&#39;t clean her room.  Her <br/>
psychologist supports us in this.&quot; or... &quot;Say thank you to Dana for <br/>
handing you a napkin.&quot; (Oh, palllease)  Or &quot;That&#39;s really good that <br/>
sissy (made up name) controlled her self and didn&#39;t eat the pie.&quot;  The <br/>
pie, I might mention, was being served to everyone at the party, both <br/>
children and adults.<br/>
<br/>
Throughout the litany of degrading comments, they would throw in an <br/>
occasional &quot;Good job!&quot; when their little pets, I mean children, did <br/>
what they were told.  My son got a couple &quot;good jobs&quot; from the parents <br/>
and I just had to cringe.<br/>
<br/>
When they would have a kind word about their child, it was always a <br/>
boast about him or her meeting some kind of expectation.<br/>
<br/>
I walked into the office at my friend&#39;s house where the teenage boys <br/>
were playing on the computer and getting ready to play some pokemon.   <br/>
When they saw me, all three of them visibly flinched.  These boys were <br/>
just having some fun, but I got the distinct impression they were <br/>
gripping themselves for getting some kind of trouble from this <br/>
adult.   I just said jokingly, &quot;I come in peace,&quot; and they all <br/>
relaxed.  Their initial reaction though, made me very sad.<br/>
<br/>
It is getting so painful for me now to participate in these <br/>
gatherings.  I just want to say to the parents, please stop NOW and <br/>
look at how you are treating your children.  It helps me feel better <br/>
by interacting and playing with their children and treating them with <br/>
respect.  I am amazed every time I do this that the children respond <br/>
so well when treated respectfully, even when it is for a short time.<br/>
<br/>
So, I have to say that I am getting a bit more selective with who I <br/>
hang out with these days, myself.<br/>

   <br/>
  They are NOT mindful gentle parents at all. They are constantly yelling at their 6 year old, she is constantly throwing fits , constantly whining about food ( no wonder when she is only allowed 3 meals a day ) and they control everything ! <br/>
   <br/>
  Tonight Courtney , my 7 year old went to walmart with me and asked momma am I a pig?  What?? no!! ( lol she is 7 and weighs 43 lbs) I realized later where she got that idea from when she mentioned that it was against the rules to eat to much here. <br/>
  I told her that it seemed like that yes but if she was hungry Id always get her food. <br/>
   <br/>
  Ive tried to encourage the other parents and gotten nowhere. Luckily we should be in our new house next Monday ( I hope ) . <br/>

quite gleeful in describing how Ali had lost &quot;chair privileges&quot; at dinner for  <br/>
...oh, I have no idea what. Doing something clearly very terrible with her <br/>

The psychologist is being paid by the parents, not the child. As a <br/>
psychologists, it helps to know which side your bread is buttered on!<br/>

If the child were paying the bill, my guess is that the advice would be <br/>
to change the parents&#39; behavior, not the child&#39;s.<br/>

of what they could be that many set their sites as low as possible.  <br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;It is getting so painful for me now to participate in these<br/>
gatherings.  I just want to say to the parents, please stop NOW and<br/>
look at how you are treating your children.  It helps me feel better<br/>
by interacting and playing with their children and treating them with<br/>
respect.  I am amazed every time I do this that the children respond<br/>
so well when treated respectfully, even when it is for a short time.<br/>
<br/>
So, I have to say that I am getting a bit more selective with who I<br/>
hang out with these days, myself. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
**I hear ya. I never thought twice about these sorts of comments before I <br/>
found unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m finding more things that I can&#39;t comfortably attend anymore with my son. <br/>
One is an indoor/outdoor play gathering for toddlers in our area. It&#39;s kind <br/>
of like a huge open gym full of toys and riding toys, etc. and then an <br/>
outdoor area that people spill into after the gym closes (lots of water <br/>
features/sprinklers, etc.).<br/>
<br/>
The last time we were there, another mom with a girl the same age as my son <br/>
(2) was just constantly tearing apart her daughter. Snacks brought on a <br/>
littany of, &quot;only eat one at a time&quot; and &quot;hey, watch it, not so many&quot;. She <br/>
was sharing her snacks with other kids and her mom said to the other moms <br/>
(out loud, of course), &quot;don&#39;t worry if your kids eat all her snacks - no one <br/>
eats as much as my daughter and she could use a break&quot;. Then she promptly <br/>
cut her off and packed away the snacks - little girl screaming and crying.<br/>
<br/>
Also, she was loudly complaining about how her daughter doesn&#39;t want to use <br/>
the potty and she doesn&#39;t understand why she is still in diapers (at 2?). <br/>
She said that all she wants to do in the bathroom is brush her teeth <br/>
constantly and, &quot;that&#39;s all she would do all day if I didn&#39;t put a stop to <br/>
it&quot;. Later she rushed to check her daughter&#39;s diaper while she was in the <br/>
middle of playing and the girl was upset at being interrupted. Her mom said, <br/>
&quot;well, if you&#39;d learn to use the potty we wouldn&#39;t have this problem&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
All this in a really big gym and my son and I weren&#39;t even close. So many <br/>
little fights and arguments for nothing. So many detrimental words and <br/>
actions in such a short time. My son kept staring at the little girl and <br/>
pointing out how she was crying. It&#39;s tough to watch and I&#39;m actively <br/>
seeking out other types of parents, too!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The other night DH and I were out to dinner together (DS was playing <br/>
in the wading pool at MIL&#39;s with his cousin) and we got seated in an <br/>
area where there were kids pretty much everywhere around us <br/>
(sometimes that&#39;s my favorite place because I can smile at the kids <br/>
and play peek and the looks they give DH because of his Santa-look <br/>
are priceless). Anyhow, the table across from us was 3 adults and a <br/>
toddler, looked about 2 maybe 3 at most. She was standing next <br/>
to &quot;dad&quot; (just guessing at the various roles/relationships). &quot;mom&quot; <br/>
was standing, cutting up something on a plate at the place adjacent <br/>
to the &quot;dad&quot; which I can only guess was the tot&#39;s seat. They kept <br/>
saying &quot;you have to sit down to eat dinner&quot; and the little one <br/>
didn&#39;t want to. She wanted dinner and standing up. They wrassled and <br/>
she fussed and they demanded and she resisted until finally <br/>
the &quot;mom&quot; took the girl out of the restaurant and the dad told the <br/>
waitress who had arrived with the rest of the food to put it in take <br/>
out boxes because the little girl couldn&#39;t behave and had to be <br/>
taken out. I could just imagine the shaming that girl received &quot;it&#39;s <br/>
your fault we had to leave...&quot; As they were wrassling, I told DH in <br/>
a  slightly louder than my usual voice but not pointedly yelling <br/>
voice about how the other day when DS (he&#39;s 8) was having dinner <br/>
with me at a restaurant, he would stand and go around the side of <br/>
the table to eat his side dish (which was literally on a side dish) <br/>
instead of having both dishes in front of him and then he would go <br/>
around the side of the table and stand to eat the other side of his <br/>
huge piece of chocolate cake dessert. I was kind of hoping they <br/>
could hear that it was Okay for a kid to not sit down to eat, even <br/>
in a restaurant, provided it was a safe spot (not likely to get <br/>
bumped into and such). <br/>
<br/>
They left, we went on with dinner, but every once in a while I&#39;d <br/>
growl a little and DH would say &quot;Still thinking about that huh?&quot; It <br/>
just bothered me the whole time. Then we went out and got a surprise <br/>
for DS (a new, real, electronic dart board with soft tip darts to <br/>
replace his toy bristle dart dartboard that was falling apart).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have often taken a restless child out of a restaurant.  Not as<br/>
punishment, but as relief for the child.  Keon does not sit and wait<br/>
well.  Sometimes he is just so restless that being in a restaurant<br/>
waiting for food is anguishing.  It&#39;s never been a big deal.  I&#39;ve<br/>
even taken him out with a menu to sit on a bench outside and used my<br/>
cell phone to &quot;phone in&quot; our orders!  LOL!  I truly believe that it<br/>
was physically uncomfortable for Keon to sit and wait while he watched<br/>
other tables having food brought to them.  Sadly, many times when we<br/>
have walked out of a restaurant I have heard people say presumingly,<br/>
&quot;OH I bet he&#39;s in for it now!&quot; Meaning that he is being punished, when<br/>
the opposite is true. I&#39;ve even had our meals packed in a to go box<br/>
and then gone outside to sit and eat because he just didn&#39;t want to be<br/>
there in that restaurant at that moment.  I probably looked like the<br/>
couple you were describing, but I sure didn&#39;t treat my child in that<br/>
fashion.<br/>
<br/>
Little bodies sometimes just need to be able to move as they need.<br/>
There was a time when I just prefered not eating out because I knew<br/>
that society expected a certain level of conformity that was not<br/>
reasonable for all (or most) children.  It wasn&#39;t because my children<br/>
couldn&#39;t &quot;behave&quot; in public but because I knew that they would be much<br/>
more comfortable at home.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  I have taught my kids to quietly tell me they need a walkabout. Of course if I sense it even if they havent told me then we do. It just works good for us to teach them to express things like this so we can take care of it before they become a big disruption to others. <br/>
   <br/>
  I also keep a couple of bags packed in my trunk. One is you basic changes of clothes, blanket diapers etc. The other I try to change out with new suprises in ...but paper, bottles of mini bubbles, cards etc...........I find this really helpful when we have to go to dr appts and I have no choice but to take all of them and its hard to leave because we are waiting for our name to be called. <br/>
   <br/>
  I have to say my children&#39;s old pediatrician knew just what she was doing. She had her practice in an old house and there was the normal inside waiting room with toys n such , then a fenced in &quot;waiting yard&quot; :) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1005512637">I know what you mean about taking your child out of the restaurant. When my <br/>
son gets freakishly active - trying to stand on the table or wanting to run <br/>
in the aisles of the restaurant while people are working - I or my husband <br/>
take him outside to run back and forth on the sidewalk in front of the <br/>
restaurant. I think people must think we&#39;re crazy running back and forth in <br/>
front of everyone. The other adult left inside the restaurant orders for <br/>
everyone and we go back inside once the food is at the table. That way, he&#39;s <br/>
got all of his super energy out and then is able to focus on eating - of <br/>
course, he has to stand on his seat next to us while eating, but I don&#39;t <br/>
mind that :)<br/>

And, too, I think most of us would also try to gauge the situation <br/>
ahead of time and prepare, plan, and arrange things to be more <br/>
comfortable for those involved (kids AND adults) or just not go if <br/>
the child or children were just not at a place where they could <br/>

We&#39;ve taken Joshua outside, we&#39;ve deliberately requested particular <br/>
locations in certain restaurants, we&#39;ve requested crackers and lemon <br/>
slices and such as we sat down so there&#39;d be something ASAP on the <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1194867765">That&#39;s why we often pick strategically located tables and request <br/>
them specifically. And we&#39;ve come up with things like &quot;basketball&quot; <br/>
with Joshua - he stands and I put my hand out head high to him and <br/>
he bounces up and down, just tapping my hand with his head each time <br/>
so it looks like I am dribbling him like a basketball. That takes <br/>
minimal space (a table near a wall with him between me and the wall <br/>
works) and it gives him an outlet for movement without his becoming <br/>
a hazard to himself or others. We&#39;ll do thumb wars, arm wrestling, <br/>
whatever. And sometimes we sit outside and wait (helps if both DH <br/>
and I have our cell phones - DH can call us when food arrives). One <br/>
favorite place has those claw machine things in the lobby/waiting <br/>
area so we make sure to bring a handful of quarters with us and <br/>
we&#39;ll play there while waiting to sit and go back there if the <br/>
service is slow (it rarely is at this place, if you time it right - <br/>
see below).<br/>
<br/>
We also try to time things - NO going to certain restaurants on <br/>
Friday or Saturday evenings - too much wait, too long for service <br/>
because the kitchen is super-busy, etc. Sometimes we&#39;ll have a snack <br/>
in transit, before we leave the house, or even sitting at the table <br/>
if need be (that&#39;s where asking for several packs of crackers AS we <br/>
sit comes in) and I have no qualms about producing a couple packets <br/>
of crackers from my purse as needed. (DH jokes that my purse is a <br/>
magic black hole - it always seems to have exactly what we need as <br/>
we need it). <br/>
<br/>
And sometimes we just don&#39;t even bother going out - we know that <br/>
we&#39;re all tired or whatever and it&#39;s just better to go home and eat <br/>
PBJs in calm than to try to get a meal at a restaurant. And, too, <br/>
since Joshua has spent most of his life eating at restaurants on a <br/>
regular basis, he&#39;s kind of used to it. Plus, a big one that a lot <br/>
of &quot;mainstream&quot; families don&#39;t get, is that HE also has a say in <br/>
where we go and has since he could express his opinion. So, for <br/>
example, we don&#39;t go to Chili&#39;s as a family - it&#39;s too loud and busy <br/>
for him. If DH and I really really want Chili&#39;s food, we go when <br/>
Joshua is at Grandma&#39;s or work some other arrangements out. Just as <br/>
since DH doesn&#39;t like another particular restaurant that Joshua and <br/>
I like, so he stays home and Joshua and I go there occasionally on <br/>
our mom & son dates.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1519661367">I&#39;m gonna chime in here as a voice from the restaurant side.<br/>
I&#39;m a waitress in a family style restaurant. I have definately seen my share of mean parents, just like you have described.<br/>
Noisy kids are not a real big deal, stacking jellies as high as you can? Cool with me. Just put &#39;em back before you leave.<br/>
Standing on the seat of the booth? Very uncool. Would you let me or my kids come to your home and stand on your chairs? Seat fabric takes alot of wear in a restaurant and is very expensive to repair or replace.<br/>
Here are my suggestions:<br/>
1. Stay in your seats as much as you can. If a kid gets itchy, take them for a walk outside, look at the landscaping, check out the rear of the building and see how stuff is handled back there, go look at the pie case. But PLEASE don&#39;t let your child stand at the edge of the booth or between tables. Servers come through dining rooms very quickly and are carrying trays of hot food. It is almost impossible to see little ones in the aisles when you have 5 or 6 plates stacked on your arms. Restaurant ware is extra heavy and durable. Even one plate dropping on a little noggin could be a severe injury.<br/>
2. If you pass crackers along to your tots, PLEASE check the seats and floors around your table for trash and crumbs before you leave. Servers are required to keep their areas clean for the next group occupying a table and every minute spent cleaning up after people is $$ out of their pockets. I could spend 10 minutes cleaning after each table leaves, and if I turn over each table six times in a shift, that is an hour that I have worked for $2.15 cents. I could turn that table over a seventh time and make 5 times that.<br/>
3. The federal government has mandated that servers do not need to make minimum wage, the average restaurant pays its servers between $2.10 and $2.20 per hour. At my restaurant, I average $85 per shift. Out of that we must pay 2.5% of our total sales to bussers and the bar, even if our tips for the night are poor. I&#39;ve had to give out as much as $20 tip-out on a $65 dollar night. In addition to that tip out, I have to pay taxes based on my total sales (not on how much I actually earn). Please keep this in mind when you come in with children. As we all know children ARE messier than adults and waiting on families tends to be more work intensive. Please keep that in mind when you tip your servers. Personally, I tip 20% unless the service is bad (and it&#39;s gotta be REALLY bad for me to tip less. As a server myself, I am very forgiving) and when I go in with little ones I tip closer to 23%<br/>
YMMV. :o)<br/>

the sidewalk in front of the restaurant. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

Been there, done that. Just last month I had to take him outside for <br/>
a while because he and his friend (who was having dinner with us) <br/>
were racing the chairs (they had wheels) in Olive Garden. He just <br/>
needed a few minutes outside and then he was calm for the rest of <br/>
the evening. <br/>

Oh...did I mention I was talking about my husband? LOL<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-991889086">Ok the not letting small children stand at the edge of tables I understand. <br/>
   <br/>
  The standing on a chair ......while I encourage my children not to stand on chairs because they might fall I just dont see that huge a deal with my 2 or 3 year old standing in the booth with me. Its usualy not an issue for us.....we are poor and rarely eat out anyway:) but maybe Ill slip off their shoes and let them stand in their socks. <br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
  The tips .......I must completely agree on this. For all the reasons you have already stated. <br/>
   <br/>
  I think whats most important is that parents consider their childrens needs and feeling in the whole equation instead of saying well I want to go to outback steakhouse and you are going to sit quietly and like it or else! <br/>
   <br/>
  If my kiddos come with us we do our best to bring them not overly hungry, in good moods and with things to occupy them. Often we find it easier to leave the kiddos with someone occasionly and go just the 2 of us. At 7 and under they will usualy choose happy meals from mcdonalds and a picnic in the back yard over sitting at o&#39; charleys. <br/>
  And dh and I as adults must admit the we enjoy an occasional kid free conversation.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m glad you posted all that information. I waited tables for 8 years and <br/>
always wished I had a forum to broadcast the tipping stuff to the world. As <br/>
a parent with a messy child, I always overtip - 20% used to be my minimum. <br/>
Now it&#39;s at least an extra $5 on top of the 20+% I leave and we try to clean <br/>
up as much as we can before we leave - not always possible to do completely, <br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
**By the way, yes, I would let you all come over and stand on my chairs at <br/>
home. I always stood on chairs when I was a child and my mom didn&#39;t have a <br/>
problem with it. I always let my son stand on our chairs at home. It is not <br/>
acceptable for my son to get on the table at a restaurant and we talk about <br/>
why that is - dirty shoes on an eating surface, the next customers don&#39;t <br/>
want to eat on a surface like that, etc., etc. He&#39;s 23 pounds and isn&#39;t <br/>
jumping around on the banquette, he&#39;s simply standing still and eating - no <br/>
more wear and tear than my or anyone else&#39;s butt. Plus, he&#39;s not on the edge <br/>
- we talk about staying out of the wait staff&#39;s way because they are really <br/>
fast and then we end up watching to see who is the fastest server in the <br/>
restaurant - that&#39;s always fun :)<br/>
