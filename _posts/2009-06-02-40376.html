<div id="ygrps-yiv-73152673">Join Carolina Homeschooler this September as we make our fourth trip to<br/>
Disney World! (NOT Disneyland -- someone else is doing that trip!)<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll explore theme parks, splash in water parks, play virtual reality games<br/>
at Disney Quest, and participate in special educational programs and group<br/>
activities - all at great discounts. To make the deal even sweeter, Disney<br/>
is offering their free dining again this year.<br/>
<br/>
The deadline to reserve Disney&#39;s free dining package is June 21. The code<br/>
for free dining is TBV, and the number for reservations is 407.939.7675.<br/>
Availability is limited, so you may need to be flexible with your choice of<br/>
resorts and dates.<br/>
<br/>
The deadline to register for our discounted group park tickets, Cirque du<br/>
Soliel tickets, and educational programs is July 4. Those who register early<br/>
will get priority in filling available chaperone spots.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;d love for you to join us! Read more about this trip (and others) at:<br/>
