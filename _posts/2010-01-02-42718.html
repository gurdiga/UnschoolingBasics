<div id="ygrps-yiv-971754180">My 9-year-old step-son has been homeschooled by his grandmother (Gram) for 4 years, since he &quot;started school.&quot;  Lots of unnecessary details -- but I am &quot;taking over&quot; his learning now -- which, because I am a John Holt devotee, actually translates to something more like, my step-son is taking over his own learning now, and I&#39;m facilitating.<br/>
<br/>
I know there has been some discussion of the whole transition and not freaking out if they want to &quot;do nothing&quot; for awhile, but I&#39;ve got to find some way to transition a little more carefully, mainly because I&#39;m walking some fine family lines.  <br/>
<br/>
I am anticipating some early incredulity from Julian -- &quot;You mean we&#39;re NOT doing school today?&quot;  I&#39;m imagining the little imp running and bragging to his older sister (who attends public school), &quot;I didn&#39;t do ANY school today!!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I know some of this can&#39;t be avoided; he&#39;s been like a caged animal for the past four years, and he &quot;hates&quot; school and everything to do with it.  He tries to determine what activities we are doing that are supposed to be educational, so he can avoid them.<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;d like to have a discussion with him about what we&#39;re doing -- just not sure how to approach that.<br/>
<br/>
As a sample of how I&#39;m planning this first week, with a tiny bit of structure, but nothing like he&#39;s used to:<br/>
- help me transplant my spider plant;<br/>
- turn the &quot;school&quot; room into a seed propagation room, since he wants to join his dad in the growing business this year;<br/>
- create new World of Warcraft characters together and join new guild;<br/>
- check out his new tools he got for Christmas and try to match up one of his Scout projects with the new tools;<br/>
- go to a craft store and get some clay;<br/>
- plan a week&#39;s worth of suppers together;<br/>
- whatever strikes him as interesting;<br/>
- help his dad with the harvesting in the greenhouse on Friday<br/>
- etc.<br/>
<br/>
Also, when he asks me, as we&#39;re doing some activity, &quot;Is this school?&quot;  what do I say?  I&#39;ve done some little activities and things with him in the recent past that could most certainly have been considered learning activities, but I never know what to say when he asks with a skeptical expression, &quot;Is this supposed to be school?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Advice highly appreciated.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-630176769">One thing you could do is tell him you want to take a vacation from school for awhile. Vacation sounds fun, but it can also allay any kind of worries of &quot;but how will I learn&quot; in a child who has been told (as most are) that &quot;education&quot; is how they learn. <br/>
<br/>
If he asks &quot;how long&quot; the vacation will be, that&#39;s a good time to talk about learning and motivation and also about deschooling - how he needs time to unlearn the bad habits of &quot;being taught&quot;. He&#39;ll know he&#39;s done deschooling when *he* no longer divides his life into &quot;school/learning&quot; and &quot;fun&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
But a shorter answer could be &quot;as long as we want&quot; if he&#39;s not the type for big, long explanations. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; Also, when he asks me, as we&#39;re doing some activity, &quot;Is this school?&quot;  what do I say?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*********************<br/>
<br/>
You could say &quot;I&#39;m sorry, is this not as much fun as I/you/we thought it would be? we can do something else.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s asking that a lot, you may be filling up too much of his time with &quot;activities&quot;. Kids can need a good bit of &quot;down time&quot; when deschooling, even from homeschool - sometimes especially from homeschool if they&#39;ve gotten used to a &quot;learning moment&quot; concealed behind every chocolate chip and game. Keep the vacation analogy in mind - what would you do if you had a nice long vacation to do Whatever you wanted? Do some fun stuff, just because. This is My last weekend of vacation from work, and I&#39;ve spend most of it watching tv with Mo, curled up on the bed enjoying each others company. That&#39;s a big part of unschooling, too. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-104942182">How about not planning his week before you talk with him? <br/>
<br/>
Suggestions, availability, choices -- along with an explanation that there is often something to learn from even the least &quot;educational&quot; looking thing so he shouldn&#39;t be surprised if he learns even when a day or an activity doesn&#39;t feel like school. Or maybe he won&#39;t learn anything new but, hopefully, he&#39;ll enjoy himself and that&#39;s fine too.<br/>
<br/>
That sounds closer to an unschooly start to me. Rather than a week&#39;s worth of planned activities that were not his choice.<br/>
<br/>
Even if he chooses most of the same things and you chose them because you know that&#39;s what he likes, the decisions need to be his.<br/>
<br/>
And if he brags to his sister that he had fun and didn&#39;t &quot;do school,&quot; good for him!<br/>
