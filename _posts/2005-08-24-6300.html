<div id="ygrps-yiv-922441617">Unschooling Basics<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is trusting the child to learn what he needs to learn when <br/>
he<br/>
needs to learn it. Unschooling is also sometimes called &quot;natural <br/>
learning&quot;<br/>
and &quot;child-led learning&quot; . But mostly unschooling is NOT school-at <br/>
home: we do<br/>
not try to replicate school in our houses. It&#39;s real living in the real<br/>
world---for and with a purpose. You cannot live and not learn---we&#39;re<br/>
surrounded by real opportunities every day to learn. And it&#39;s REAL <br/>
learning,<br/>
not simulated as in school. Living is learning is unschooling is living <br/>
is learning is<br/>
unschooling.....<br/>
<br/>
There are several good books on the inanity and insanity of schools and <br/>
on<br/>
the marvels of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
The unschooling &quot;patron saint&quot; is John Holt. He was a school reformer <br/>
in the<br/>
70&#39;s who came to realize that schools are NOT reformable. His most <br/>
popular<br/>
books are How Children Fail, How Children Learn, Teach Your Own, and <br/>
Learning<br/>
All the Time.<br/>
<br/>
John Taylor Gatto was a NY city and NY state teacher of the year. He <br/>
finally<br/>
quit and started on the speaking circuit. He seems completely behind<br/>
unschooling. His two big books are Dumbing Us Down and The Underground<br/>
History of American Education.<br/>
<br/>
Frank Smith has a great little book called The Book of Learning and<br/>
Forgetting that shows how little one learns in and remembers from <br/>
school. He<br/>
pushes REAL learning---for a purpose.<br/>
<br/>
Alfie Kohn&#39;s Punished by Rewards shows the total inanity of EXtrinsic<br/>
motivation (gold stars, grades, etc.) and the attributes of INtrinsic<br/>
motivation (learning because it&#39;s FUN!).<br/>
<br/>
Grace Llewellyn&#39;s The Teenage Liberation Handbook (How to Quit School <br/>
and<br/>
Get a REAL Education) is the &quot;bible&quot; for unschoolers. It&#39;s a great read <br/>
for<br/>
teens, but parents should read it too. Be SURE not to skip the &quot;cute <br/>
little<br/>
story&quot; at the beginning. Grace also hosts the &quot;Not Back To School Camp&quot; <br/>
in<br/>
the early fall for teen unschoolers---a place to meet other unschoolers <br/>
and share<br/>
passions and interests.<br/>
<br/>
Mary Griffith has two books, The Homeschooling Handbook and The <br/>
Unschooling<br/>
Handbook. The Homeschooling Handbook has many great ideas for <br/>
documenting<br/>
what&#39;s being learned; and, since that is a requirement in several <br/>
states, it&#39;s very<br/>
helpful. But The Unschooling Handbook is THE handbook for new <br/>
unschoolers. In it she<br/>
gives real life examples and explanations. VERY understandable. <br/>
Convinced my<br/>
husband that what I was suggesting made sense! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
David Albert has two: And the Skylark Sings with Me and Homeschooling <br/>
and the<br/>
Voyage of Self-Discovery. Both are witty---and easy reads.<br/>
<br/>
Valerie Fitzenreiter has a brand new book that I highly recommend: The<br/>
Unprocessed Child: Living Without School. It&#39;s about unschooling her<br/>
daughter, Laurie. I give it as gifts a LOT!<br/>
<br/>
Magazines:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Life Learning Magazine&quot;<br/>
?Live Free Learn Free?<br/>
&quot;Growing Without Schooling&quot;, originally put out by John Holt. No longer <br/>
in<br/>
production, but back issues available from &quot;old&quot; unschoolers and from <br/>
FUNbooks.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Websites:<br/>
<br/>
_www.unschooling.info_ (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unschooling.info/)">http://www.unschooling.info/)</a> is THE website <br/>
for<br/>
unschooling. There are other lists that &quot;say&quot; they unschool; these are <br/>
the radicals who KNOW what they are talking about. There are essays and <br/>
FAQs which you should definitely read first.<br/>
Afterwards go to the message boards and read, read, READ! If you have<br/>
questions after reading for a few weeks, then post---but most things <br/>
have been<br/>
explained before, so if you read, you&#39;ll run across the answers to most <br/>
of your<br/>
questions.<br/>
<br/>
Some posters to pay attention to are Sandra Dodd, Joyce Fetteroll, Pam <br/>
Sorooshian, Anne Ohman, Ren Allen, Deb Lewis, Rue Kream, Robyn Coburn, <br/>
Danielle Conger, and Mary Gold. There are other wonderful posters, but <br/>
these are all radical unschoolers who all have great ways of expressing <br/>
themselves and getting to the nitty gritty of unschooling. They will <br/>
all be at the conference in October.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra Dodd is a radical unschooler of three children, 18, 15, & 13. <br/>
She has her own website that is chocked FULL of essays and stories <br/>
about<br/>
unschooling. It&#39;s a great place to start. <br/>

(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sandradodd.com/unschooling)">http://www.sandradodd.com/unschooling)</a> .<br/>
<br/>
Ned Vare & Luz Shosie have an <br/>
already-graduated-from-college-always-unschooled son. Their website is <br/>
full of short essays on unschooling. They have a newsletter as well and <br/>
a regular get-together in CT._<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://borntoexplore.org/unschool/_">http://borntoexplore.org/unschool/_</a> <br/>

<br/>
Billy and Nancy Greer own FUN-books---a mail-order catalogue for <br/>
unschoolish<br/>
books and games. _www.FUN-Books.com_ (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.fun-books.com/)">http://www.fun-books.com/)</a><br/>

(mailto:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>) is a great e-list for <br/>
those serious about discussing unschooling. I recommend reading a while <br/>
to ?get the feel? of some posters&#39; styles before posting.<br/>
<br/>
There is also <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:_UnschoolingBasics@yahoogroups.com">_UnschoolingBasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>
mailto:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:UnschoolingBasics@yahoogroups.com">UnschoolingBasics@yahoogroups.com</a>) . For beginners. Owned by Ren <br/>
Allen and Kelly Lovejoy, this list caters those who are just starting <br/>
out. We try to be gentle! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
For those looking to unschool from the very beginning, try <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:AlwaysUnschooled@yahoogroups.com">AlwaysUnschooled@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>
. They have a monthly book discussion that might appeal to many! This <br/>
site is run by Danielle Conger and Robyn Coburn, and they chat with the <br/>
parents of children from birth to eight years old---who aren&#39;t <br/>
?technically? unschooling because the children are not yet of ?school <br/>
age.?<br/>
<br/>
Anne Ohman started <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:ShinewithUnschooling@yahoogroups.com">ShinewithUnschooling@yahoogroups.com</a> for those with <br/>
specific questions about children who are considered ?non-typical?: <br/>
?Highly Sensitive?, ?Out of Sync?, ?Asperger?s?, ?Explosive?. They <br/>
discuss how unschooling frees their spirits and allows them to truly <br/>
*Shine*.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra Dodd&#39;s <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> is a list for those that <br/>
already ?get it.? It&#39;s a place to discuss deeper levels of <br/>
unschooling---the real radicals! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Ren Allen will concentrate on juggling large families and the creative <br/>
ways to give each child what he needs.<br/>
<br/>
Ben Lovejoy will again lead the dads in more thought-provoking <br/>
discussions and encourage living by principles.<br/>
<br/>
Talk about struggles and successes in letting go, supporting your <br/>
family in being lifelong learners, and questioning issues from chores, <br/>
to bedtime, to video games and television. Ask all the questions you&#39;ve <br/>
been struggling with in our afternoon break-out sessions.<br/>
Have FUN! In addition to Funshops where you and your kids can learn new <br/>
things and just play, there&#39;ll be the Talent Show and many more <br/>
surprises. You&#39;ll have plenty of time to hang out at the pool and relax <br/>
or share a meal with old/new friends.<br/>

<br/>
Live and Learn is a volunteer-driven conference-giving organization <br/>
that pulls attendees from all over the US and Canada. Its mission is to <br/>
support and promote unschooling, provide information, offer <br/>
opportunities for families to get together, and empower families to <br/>
make the choices that respect the rights, needs and aspirations of <br/>
their children. L&L welcomes anyone with an interest in unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Since its inception in 2001, L&L has supported families that have made <br/>
the decision to unschool as they face difficult questions and <br/>
challenges. These families may wonder about socialization, or <br/>
integration of John Holt&#39;s educational philosophy into their everyday <br/>
lives. Some families may doubt their abilities, feel confused and ask <br/>
themselves, &quot;Can I really do this?&quot;. L&L encourages parents to trust <br/>
themselves and their children to make good decisions and empowers them <br/>
to find the support and information they need. L&L also gives you the <br/>
opportunity to see unschooling families ?up close and personal?---to <br/>
see them in action!<br/>

You may also all me anytime to ask questions or discuss concerns. I <br/>
truly believe that school is harmful---physically, emotionally, <br/>
intellectually, and spiritually. It&#39;s a bad place to spend a childhood.<br/>

Kelly,<br/>
Thank you SO much for posting this information! (all in one place).  It <br/>
includes many of the things I&#39;ve collected since I started reasearching <br/>
homeschooling 2+ years ago and was led to unschooling and it&#39;s nice to <br/>
see it again, especially for anyone who may be new to this site.<br/>
<br/>
This is a great place for newbies to unschooling to ask questions, or <br/>
just absorb until you get a feel for what unschooling is about, but I <br/>
highly recommend checking out the sites of the long time unschoolers <br/>
mentioned and the books (READ READ READ!).   It took me a while to &quot;get <br/>
it&quot; but once I did, there&#39;s no turning back!  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m coming to this with a child who just finished 6th grade.  It&#39;s <br/>
never too late.<br/>

ME TOO! Cameron went to school for eight years, through sixth grade. It <br/>
was DEFINITELY harder to deschool and unschool him than it&#39;s been with <br/>
Duncan, who has never been to school.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m talking about just that, too, at this year&#39;s <br/>
conference---unschooling after years and years of school. It&#39;s so <br/>
different from unschooling from the beginning!<br/>

<br/>
Glad to hear that!  Finding others who have pulled a child out of <br/>
school around my daughter&#39;s age has been difficult, but I&#39;m in a much <br/>
better place now.  Once we decided to &quot;get out&quot; I really worked on <br/>
adopting an unschooling frame of mind, even though she was still in <br/>
school (she wanted to try 6th grade and middle school!), which helped <br/>
us get started early, so to speak.  She&#39;s been deschooling since she <br/>
left school in June (well, probably before that, I didn&#39;t push her to <br/>
be &quot;perfect&quot; (meaning that as a &quot;school&quot; word, not mine! - re: <br/>
grades, reading books etc) while in school and I can see some healing <br/>
already.  You really have to TRUST that they need time to heal, and <br/>
it will vary from child to child (the recommendation that it takes a <br/>
month for each year in school is a good place to start, but we&#39;re <br/>
just taking it as it comes, no matter HOW long).  <br/>

I&#39;m so glad you&#39;ll be addressing this, there&#39;s a real need for those <br/>
like us to hear that.  I&#39;ve learned a lot from those who have always <br/>
unschooled, but it&#39;s helpful for those of us coming to it later on <br/>
(like I said before, it&#39;s NEVER too late!) I wish I could be there, <br/>

Yes, all presentations will be available on CD this year. I have a <br/>
local audio firm recording the talks for me. Professionally done. The <br/>
last years have been me and a tape recorder. Pretty poor quality, <br/>
unfortunately. This will be a bit more expensive, but the quality will <br/>
be first class! And they should be done before I leave St Louis to come <br/>
home!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll have the resource page on the website set as soon as the <br/>
conference is over.<br/>

<br/>
Wow, VERY outdated.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve added a few new things and deleted others. I&#39;ll update this soon, but here&#39;s what I have now. It&#39;s a good start.<br/>

<br/>
Unschooling Basics?<br/>
?<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is trusting the child to learn what he needs to learn when <br/>
he?<br/>
<br/>
needs to learn it. Unschooling is also sometimes called &quot;natural <br/>
learning&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
and &quot;child-led learning&quot; . But mostly unschooling is NOT school-at <br/>
home: we do?<br/>
<br/>
not try to replicate school in our houses. It&#39;s real living in the real?<br/>
<br/>
world---for and with a purpose. You cannot live and not learn---we&#39;re?<br/>
<br/>
surrounded by real opportunities every day to learn. And it&#39;s REAL <br/>
learning,?<br/>
<br/>
not simulated as in school. Living is learning is unschooling is living <br/>
is learning is?<br/>
<br/>
unschooling.....?<br/>
?<br/>
<br/>
There are several good books on the inanity and insanity of schools and <br/>
on?<br/>
<br/>
the marvels of unschooling.?<br/>
?<br/>
<br/>
The unschooling &quot;patron saint&quot; is John Holt. He was a school reformer <br/>
in the?<br/>
<br/>
70&#39;s who came to realize that schools are NOT reformable. His most <br/>
popular?<br/>
<br/>
books are How Children Fail, How Children Learn, Teach Your Own, and <br/>
Learning?<br/>
<br/>
All the Time.?<br/>
?<br/>
<br/>
John Taylor Gatto was a NY city and NY state teacher of the year. He <br/>
finally?<br/>
<br/>
quit and started on the speaking circuit. He seems completely behind?<br/>
<br/>
unschooling. His two big books are Dumbing Us Down and The Underground?<br/>
<br/>
History of American Education.?<br/>
?<br/>
<br/>
Frank Smith has a great little book called The Book of Learning and?<br/>
<br/>
Forgetting that shows how little one learns in and remembers from <br/>
school. He?<br/>
<br/>
pushes REAL learning---for a purpose.?<br/>
?<br/>
<br/>
Alfie Kohn&#39;s Punished by Rewards shows the total inanity of EXtrinsic?<br/>
<br/>
motivation (gold stars, grades, etc.) and the attributes of INtrinsic?<br/>
<br/>
motivation (learning because it&#39;s FUN!).?<br/>
?<br/>
<br/>
Grace Llewellyn&#39;s The Teenage Liberation Handbook (How to Quit School <br/>
and?<br/>
<br/>
Get a REAL Education) is the &quot;bible&quot; for unschoolers. It&#39;s a great read <br/>
for?<br/>
<br/>
teens, but parents should read it too. Be SURE not to skip the &quot;cute <br/>
little?<br/>
<br/>
story&quot; at the beginning. Grace also hosts the &quot;Not Back To School Camp&quot; <br/>
in?<br/>
<br/>
the early fall for teen unschoolers---a place to meet other unschoolers <br/>
and share?<br/>
<br/>
passions and interests.?<br/>
?<br/>
<br/>
Mary Griffith has two books, The Homeschooling Handbook and The <br/>
Unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
Handbook. The Homeschooling Handbook has many great ideas for <br/>
documenting?<br/>
<br/>
what&#39;s being learned; and, since that is a requirement in several <br/>
states, it&#39;s very?<br/>
<br/>
helpful. But The Unschooling Handbook is THE handbook for new <br/>
unschoolers. In it she?<br/>
<br/>
gives real life examples and explanations. VERY understandable. <br/>
Convinced my?<br/>
<br/>
husband that what I was suggesting made sense! &lt;g&gt;?<br/>
?<br/>
<br/>
David Albert has two: And the Skylark Sings with Me and Homeschooling <br/>
and the?<br/>
<br/>
Voyage of Self-Discovery. Both are witty---and easy reads.?<br/>
?<br/>
<br/>
Valerie Fitzenreiter has a brand new book that I highly recommend: The?<br/>
<br/>
Unprocessed Child: Living Without School. It&#39;s about unschooling her?<br/>
<br/>
daughter, Laurie. I give it as gifts a LOT!?<br/>

<br/>
unschooling. There are other lists that &quot;say&quot; they unschool; these are <br/>
the radicals who KNOW what they are talking about. There are essays and <br/>
FAQs which you should definitely read first.?<br/>
<br/>
Afterwards go to the message boards and read, read, READ! If you have?<br/>
<br/>
questions after reading for a few weeks, then post---but most things <br/>
have been?<br/>
<br/>
explained before, so if you read, you&#39;ll run across the answers to most <br/>
of your?<br/>
<br/>
questions. <br/>
<br/>
New site is RUN.NING, started by Laura Bowman. Blogs and more!<br/>

themselves and getting to the nitty gritty of unschooling.? <br/>
?<br/>
<br/>

. They have a monthly book discussion that might appeal to many! This <br/>
site is run by Danielle Conger and Robyn Coburn, and they chat with the <br/>
parents of children from birth to eight years old---who aren&#39;t <br/>
?technically? unschooling because the children are not yet of ?school <br/>
age.??<br/>
?<br/>
<br/>
Anne Ohman started <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:ShinewithUnschooling@yahoogroups.com">ShinewithUnschooling@yahoogroups.com</a> for those with <br/>
specific questions about children who are considered ?non-typical?:  <br/>
?Highly Sensitive?, ?Out of Sync?, ?Asperger?s?, ?Explosive?. They <br/>
discuss how unschooling frees their spirits and allows them to truly <br/>
*Shine*.?<br/>

<br/>
You may also all me anytime to ask questions or discuss concerns. I <br/>
truly believe that school is harmful---physically, emotionally, <br/>
intellectually, and spiritually. It&#39;s a bad place to spend a childhood.?<br/>
