<div id="ygrps-yiv-1000032827">I just rejected two posts for being put-downs,rather than useful <br/>
discussion, but I thought one of the ideas was worth discussing for <br/>
it&#39;s sheer illogical point.<br/>
<br/>
It was a response to this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No, joke! Heck, I sometimes wish t.v. my kids would get into a<br/>
state like this simply by having them watch t.v. My boys 6,5, and 2<br/>
watch t.v. 99.9% of the time and 99.9% of the time are literally<br/>
bouncing off the walls!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  The poster was implying that television would make kids hyper!!<br/>
<br/>
So now we have anti-tv folks claiming that television will make <br/>
kids &quot;comatose&quot; AND hyper??? The completely illogical connection <br/>
amazes me.<br/>
<br/>
HOW on earth does one kind of media claim responsibilty for making <br/>
kids &quot;bounce off the walls&quot; AND &quot;comatose&quot;???<br/>
<br/>
I think we can easily discuss the factors that affect kids energy <br/>
levels without blaming television for being both overstimulating AND <br/>
dulling all at once. How about  looking at individuals and how they <br/>
are affected by food, input, sleep etc...without blaming ONE source <br/>
for all ills?<br/>
<br/>
It amazes me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was thinking about the hyperactivity and wondered if the kids are <br/>
bouncing off the walls are they really watching television or is <br/>
television just a vehicle for momentary distractions while bouncing <br/>
from one wall to the other.  I would think that even without <br/>
television that these boys (they were all boys, right?) would <br/>
probably be bouncing off the walls anyway.  They would be being, <br/>
well, children!  :-)  <br/>
<br/>
I do know that there are children who actively watch television, as <br/>
in  they do other things while engaged in television, be it sew, <br/>
build legos or blocks, color, even read.  I tend to knit when I <br/>
watch television as it helps my busy hands find something to do.  I <br/>
know several times I have gone into the living room to see the tv on <br/>
but no one engaged in it.  I will ask if anyone is paying attention <br/>
and if not can I turn it off.  Most always they say I can turn it <br/>
off.  Rarely is anyone actually watching it.  The tv has just become <br/>
some kind of background noise.  <br/>

<br/>
Exactly!<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why it was pretty funny that as soon as someone posts how <br/>
energetic her children are, it immedietly gets blamed on television, <br/>
right after all the &quot;comatose&quot; statements.<br/>
<br/>
My children are almost always doing more than just watching a show. <br/>
Sierra was making a beaded charm today while Blue&#39;s Clues was <br/>
running.  None of them sit watching it &quot;zombie-like&quot; EVER.<br/>
<br/>
They did when I controlled it though. Boy, they knew their time was <br/>
limited and they SOAKED it up. It&#39;s just another thing in their home <br/>
now...it holds no more fascination than books, paint or food. Each <br/>
is interesting and wonderful when they need it.<br/>
<br/>
Right now, all televisions are off, in spite of cable programming <br/>
with loads of channels and tons of DVD&#39;s to choose from.<br/>
<br/>
The fascinating thing at this moment, is burning newsprint in the <br/>
fireplace. They took huge sheets of it and had a wild 1/2 hour <br/>
tearing it up, making &quot;nests&quot; and burying each other in paper. My <br/>
entire living room is COVERED with it right now.<br/>
Sierra, Jared and Jalen are sitting on the hearth, grabing wads of <br/>
paper and watching it burn. Fun way to clean up!!:)<br/>
<br/>
I remember being somewhat &quot;veg-like&quot; when I watched television for <br/>
years. I didn&#39;t have one growing up, so it was the most fascinating <br/>
thing when I got around one. It took me years to stop being <br/>
fascinated by the thing. I would sit and channel surf for hours, in <br/>
spite of not really liking what I was watching.<br/>
I&#39;m glad my kids will never have to figure out how to balance <br/>
themselves, they already know.<br/>

begging me to go see Jalen so he can burn paper too!  LOL!!!  The <br/>
kids are still busy building and painting dollhouse furniture.  Lots <br/>
of paint and pieces of cardboard everywhere.  We sat down to watch a <br/>
movie together and slowly kids started drifting out of the room to <br/>
go do other things.  I ended up finding myself alone watching a <br/>
movie I wasn&#39;t planning on watching!  LOL!!<br/>

dry debris left over from the hurricane I&#39;m not about to burn <br/>
outside.  Maybe I&#39;ll drop the kids off at Ren&#39;s house with all their <br/>
carboard (which would probably be toxic by now with all the various <br/>
paints on it!)<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
There was a comment made on a local homeschooling list recently about how<br/>
there is &quot;nothing good about TV.&quot;  At the time I was reading it, my two dds,<br/>
who have complete access to satellite TV, were in the living room with an<br/>
unschooled friend writing stories and reading them to each other.  I<br/>
chuckled as I read it.  Today my girls watched an hour of TV, so far.  From<br/>
7-8 a.m.  They turned it off of their own volition at 8 to play with each<br/>
other.  It still hasn&#39;t been turned back on and it&#39;s 7:10 p.m.  I am<br/>
thinking about turning it on for myself as soon as I catch up on email, but<br/>
the kids haven&#39;t turned it back on all day.  (oh yeah, I forgot I said I&#39;d<br/>
read to the kids in a few minutes.)  We did .go to the barn, rode our horse,<br/>
went to a birthday party, came home, went back to the barn, got a couple<br/>
quick meals in between there somewhere and just played.   This is a typical<br/>
day for us, minus the birthday party.<br/>

One thing I am learning on this website, among other things, is how <br/>
to explain things in a clear manner.  I am not a writer but am <br/>
learning!  I&#39;m afraid that I did not do a good job explaining myself <br/>
on this post at all!  Sorry about that....<br/>
<br/>
What I meant was that the television in my home is on 99% of the <br/>
time.  The kids may actually not be sitting down watching it at <br/>
times, but it is on.  My boys do not go to bed until sometimes 2 or <br/>
3 a.m.  It will be left on overnight sometimes.  My two year old <br/>
often wakes up at 6 to 6:30 a.m. and sometimes doesn&#39;t even need to <br/>
turn the television on because it&#39;s always on.  Granted, they may <br/>
not be sitting down watching it at times because they like doing <br/>
other things of course.  <br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to clearify that one.  Thank you for letting me share.<br/>

go). From the menu, you can tell the TV to shut off in an hour or 30 <br/>
minutes or whatever. So the kids, once they learn how (and they&#39;re <br/>
awfully quick to pick up stuff involving remotes and controllers and <br/>
things lol), they can set it so that it turns off after whatever <br/>
they&#39;re watching. And, if they&#39;re not asleep then, they can turn it <br/>
back on and re-set the timer. That way it&#39;s not just on all night - <br/>

I can see the light pattern flicker reflected on the stairway wall <br/>
when my door is open and it freaks me out - especially when DS and <br/>
DH are sleeping tucked in right beside me.</div>
