<div id="ygrps-yiv-2009156315">Hi everybody !<br/>
<br/>
Sylvain is almost 8 and we&#39;ve been unschooling for two years now. I<br/>
firmly believe that this is the best path for all of us - though not<br/>
the easiest for me, maybe ... <br/>
<br/>
I trust my kids to know what is good for them and to show me what they<br/>
need, but I find it very hard to trust myself. I have the feeling that<br/>
I don&#39;t have what it takes to be an unschooling mom. <br/>
<br/>
So what does it take ? <br/>
<br/>
- being a good listener (I could do better)<br/>
- being available for them at any time<br/>
- being able to support them on their projects without interfering in<br/>
them or turning them into &quot;study units&quot; of any kind. <br/>
- knowing when to turn to books or material to help them when they<br/>
need (for instance, my daughter want me to teach her how to read - I<br/>
don&#39;t know how to do that). <br/>
- proposing a lot of interesting things to do, without feeling<br/>
rejected when they&#39;re not interested in them. <br/>
- trusting them even when they spend their whole day playing with the<br/>
Nintendo. <br/>
<br/>
- turning a deaf ear to all the people who give me unsollicited advise<br/>
about : how to teach things to my kids, why I should put them back to<br/>
school, why HOMEschooling is so much better than UNschooling, why<br/>
diplomas are so important in our world and so on and so forth<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and also to those who feel so sorry for my kids being kept away<br/>
from this wonderful institution, and from all these great things and<br/>
projects they do ...<br/>
<br/>
Actually, the only person who agrees with me is my husband. I have ONE<br/>
friend who is also homeschooling, but she is really far from<br/>
unschooling and sincerely thinks that teaching french and mathematics<br/>
to her kids is necessary.<br/>
<br/>
Which is not completely false, as we have to comply to annual testing,<br/>
here in Geneva (Switzerland). At his first test, my son was in the<br/>
average for reading (though I never taught him anything directly) and<br/>
his results weren&#39;t very good in maths. The only way to escape testing<br/>
is to enroll in a correspondance school and send its reports to the<br/>
Public School Department. <br/>
<br/>
So here I am, full of trust, on one hand, and doubts, on the other<br/>
hand. Hard to keep deschooling your own mind without help (I don&#39;t<br/>
believe all the things people tell me, it&#39;s not that the problem, it&#39;s<br/>
just that I can&#39;t share my thoughts/doubts/reflexions with anyone, as<br/>
everybody believes I&#39;m so wrong doing what I do). <br/>
<br/>
I try not to feel pressured by the disapproval around me, and most of<br/>
the time, I succeed, but not always. Sometimes, it comes back to me,<br/>
and I think &quot;Oh my God, what if THEY were right ? Who am I to know<br/>
better ?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling feels so right to me - and still, I have doubts. About me,<br/>
about the context (maybe unschooling isn&#39;t possible when EVERYBODY<br/>
goes to school around you and believes it&#39;s the best thing ever<br/>
created), about the fact that we&#39;ll be able to bypass the compulsory<br/>
testing ...<br/>
<br/>
How is it for you ? In your unschooling path, how helpful is the<br/>
context ? Is it as favorable as it looks from abroad ? What is the<br/>
part of your inner resources ? What are the required qualities for<br/>
being a unschooling mom, an unschooling family ? What could ruin an<br/>
unschooling project ?<br/>
<br/>
Hope my questions aren&#39;t too confused. <br/>
<br/>
As always, I&#39;m deeply grateful for your answers and insights.<br/>
<br/>
Helen, unschooling mom of Sylvain (8), Cyrielle (6) and CircÃ© (3), in<br/>
Geneva, Switzerland</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-356386958">Dear Helen -<br/>
<br/>
What really help me, sometimes, is to take the 10,000 foot view.<br/>
<br/>
What does my child want?  What brings him joy?  What makes him sparkle?<br/>
How can I help facilitate their growth, both emotionally, physically,<br/>
mentally?<br/>
How can I make myself a better person and help myself emotionally,<br/>
physically, mentally?<br/>
<br/>
Keeping the focus small and on your child and your family, can help <br/>
find less importance in what others think.<br/>
<br/>
Take care, Lyssa</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-483506230">Hi Helen,<br/>
<br/>
You wrote :-&gt;&gt;I have the &lt;feeling that I don&#39;t have what it takes to <br/>
be an &gt;&gt;unschooling mom. <br/>
<br/>
Bear in mind my tone is coming across gentle and kind. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why do you have so little faith in yourself that what you&#39;re doing <br/>
is the best for your kids? That you&#39;ve given them a better option <br/>
than schooling. That your love and concern for thier well being is <br/>
all that it needs to guide you and your kids towards a better future?<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is an ongoing process. It is about living and learning <br/>
as we go along. It doesn&#39;t have guidelines or dealines.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So what does it take ?  being a good listener (I could do better)<br/>
&gt; being available for them at any time<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know for I am not a very good listener, but I do pay <br/>
attention to what my kid is doing and saying, all the time while I&#39;m <br/>
cooking, reading or tidying my house. I don&#39;t have to sit down and <br/>
listen intently but I do listen to him. Like from which toy he would <br/>
like to what cartoon he is watching; to asking him why is he <br/>
crushing poor little Lego man with his Lego mail van LOL!!<br/>
<br/>
Well it is obvious the &quot;van&quot; is running over the Lego man, but I <br/>
really wanted to know why would the &quot;van&quot; run over the man so many <br/>
times LOL!<br/>
<br/>
I asked and listen to his explanation what he&#39;s doing, where is he <br/>
driving his &quot;new sport car&quot; to, and what new furniture have he got <br/>
in his house in Grand Theft Auto game.  <br/>
<br/>
I listen to him explaining to me what he had to do in his new Batman <br/>
Lego game, and watch him acting out the Lego Cat woman&#39;s and Poison <br/>
Ivy&#39;s mannerisms. <br/>
<br/>
Nowadays, I&#39;m not really that focused on him. <br/>
<br/>
Even tho I am always at home, I&#39;m not necessary available to him all <br/>
the time, like now, I&#39;m typing my &quot;3 hour&quot; response to you (yeah, <br/>
I&#39;m abit slow in typing), DS is playing at the front room on his <br/>
own. Occasionally I&#39;ll asked what is he doing? <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like we&#39;re in the same house, we&#39;re each doing our own thing <br/>
but we are aware what we each is doing.  I supposed I am listening,  <br/>
by taking interest with whatever he is doing. <br/>
<br/>
Like if I put on a new cd, I&#39;ll asked if he&#39;s got any music <br/>
preferance? So when he tells me which cd he wants, I&#39;m listening. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; - being able to support them on their projects without interfering <br/>
 </span></blockquote>in them or turning them into &quot;study units&quot; of any kind. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; - knowing when to turn to books or material to help them when they<br/>
&gt; need (for instance, my daughter want me to teach her how to read - <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know how to do that). <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You wrote &quot;I trust my kids to know what is good for them and to show <br/>
me what they need&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
If you trust your kids to know what they want, then let THEM SHOW <br/>
YOU what to do. <br/>
<br/>
You need to allow them to take control and ownership of thier <br/>
learning and interest directions, by allowing them to do whatever <br/>
thier heart tells them to. <br/>
<br/>
And when they don&#39;t want to do it, then they don&#39;t want to do it. <br/>
Simple as that. If you want to do it, then you do it instead. <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t impose your expectation on them. <br/>
<br/>
For example- your daughter wants to learn to read. Can she read <br/>
already? Let&#39;s explore the many ways to leanr to read. Computer? <br/>
Electronic books? <br/>
<br/>
If not, start easy by letting her pick the books she likes.  Library <br/>
near you? Go to a library,  and allow her to pick the books that she <br/>
like and read together. By giving her freedom to choose what and how <br/>
she wants to read, you are facilitating her learning. <br/>
<br/>
I believe reading to the child facilitates thier reading. I also <br/>
believe reading for pleasure should come first before learning to <br/>
read. Despite the fact that my son is very advance in reading <br/>
skills, he prefers me reading to him. In the library, he&#39;ll pick the <br/>
books he wants to &quot;read&quot; and I&#39;m his &quot;reading machine&quot; LOL!!  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; - proposing a lot of interesting things to do, without feeling<br/>
&gt; rejected when they&#39;re not interested in them. <br/>
&gt;&gt;What could ruin an unschooling project?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your expectations!!!  When you expect co-orporation, results or an <br/>
ending, you WILL ruin any project. <br/>
<br/>
Remember, it&#39;s THE KID&quot;S project, and their interest, and thier <br/>
curiosities that&#39;s needed to be quench. Not yours. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I like astronomy, but my kid thinks it&#39;s ultimate boring LOL!! I <br/>
would never force him to sit down and do one of those astronomy kits <br/>
with me. He&#39;ll say &quot;you do it, and show it to me afterwards&quot;. Of <br/>
which, when finished, he&#39;s quite happy to claimed it as his, to be <br/>
part of his Star Wars Lego&#39;s set up LOL!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You also have to allow them to be able to change thier mind and <br/>
switch to something different, if they deem fit. You have to trust <br/>
they know what they are doing best for their mind (tho not necessary <br/>
for thier body LOL! but that&#39;s another whole unschooling chapter on <br/>
learning to trust our kids to eat what they need LOL!!) <br/>
<br/>
So the kids will only take the project as far as they want to. Once <br/>
they had enough, they will want to move onto another interest/ <br/>
project.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My kid&#39;s projects is always on an on-going or KIV basis. Sometimes <br/>
he&#39;ll start a project he thinks is fun, but stop 5 minutes into it <br/>
because he realised it&#39;s harder than he expected it to be; or too <br/>
much work and not willing to sacrifice his time on it; or it&#39;s just <br/>
plain boring. <br/>
<br/>
Ok, I&#39;m cool with that and he&#39;ll either go onto something easier or <br/>
decide to watch tv instead. <br/>
<br/>
But a few days later, he might decide he&#39;ll give it ago again, now <br/>
that he knows what to expect. <br/>
<br/>
So if I did have an expectation of some sort, I would have got upset <br/>
with him, and that inturn would have frightened him off trying <br/>
anything in the future, because he definetely wouldn&#39;t want me <br/>
getting upset with him again. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; - trusting them even when they spend their whole day playing with <br/>
&gt;   the Nintendo. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is a big difference between &quot;accomodating&quot; and &quot;trusting&quot;. <br/>
Accomodating is when you allow the child to do what they want, <br/>
without understanding why, other than because it is just what <br/>
unschoolers do.  <br/>
<br/>
Trusting is about understanding and accpeting and having confidence <br/>
in that your child knows his/ her own way to happiness and <br/>
contentment to adulthood and life.    <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I trust my kid is doing something good for himself in whatever <br/>
he is doing all the time. And that he will grow up learning to <br/>
listen to his own better judgement, relevant to his life, and not <br/>
mine. <br/>
<br/>
And this may include not having a diploma at all. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Do you really trust you kids that much, that you believe every <br/>
moment, every decision they make is contributing to a better future <br/>
for themselves? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; - turning a deaf ear to all the people who give me unsollicited <br/>
&gt;advise about : how to teach things to my kids, why I should put <br/>
&gt;them back to school, why HOMEschooling is so much better than <br/>
&gt;UNschooling, why diplomas are so important in our world and so on <br/>
&gt;and so forth<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re tired of listening!! So tell them you&#39;re not being rude, but <br/>
would prefer not to listen to THIER opinion. If they pursue, then <br/>
THEY ARE BEING RUDE! Which gives you every right to be rude by <br/>
telling them to mind thier own bl**dy business!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Nevermind what everybody says, but DO YOU THINK IT IS A PROBLEM? <br/>
Because if you don&#39;t, then why shoudl you care what other people <br/>
say? Do they pay your bills? Do they feed you? Do you need them? Do <br/>
they REALLY know best? WHO ARE THEY?<br/>
<br/>
Why do you need them? <br/>
<br/>
Diplomas!! Asked yourself this question. The world is at war <br/>
everywhere. Nobody knows what&#39;s gonna happen in the next 2 or 3 or 5 <br/>
years?  <br/>
<br/>
What good is a diploma do should your children find themselves in a <br/>
war zone? I know this is a very harsh and seem not relevant <br/>
question, but nobody can say for sure it won&#39;t happen. <br/>
<br/>
So what&#39;s so good of a diploma is the holder itself is so unsure of <br/>
his/ her life? I know so many uni- graduated people, so unhappy and <br/>
stuck with thier life!<br/>
<br/>
I, for one, would prefer my kid&#39;s happiness more than any piece of <br/>
paper qualification. I don&#39;t believe that without a piece of paper, <br/>
my son is any less qualified than any other person in his choice of <br/>
career. I also believe should my son requires a diploma or degree, <br/>
then he&#39;ll see sense for it, and will work towards it. <br/>
<br/>
My kid wants to be a toy shop owner, so no need for diploma or <br/>
degree for that. Before this, he wants to be a train driver, again <br/>
no need for a diploma for that. Maybe  afew years from now, he&#39;ll <br/>
tell me he wants to be in the medical profession, only then we&#39;ll <br/>
start thinking what&#39;s necessary then. <br/>
 <br/>
At the moment, nobody can distinguish a good diploma from a bad <br/>
diploma because it is already so generic. Everbody can get a <br/>
diplomma, or a degree or a MBA.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Oh, and also to those who feel so sorry for my kids being kept away<br/>
&gt; from this wonderful institution, and from all these great things <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and projects they do ...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just smile at thier ignorance, and tell yourself (and BELIVE IT) <br/>
that you have better common sense and a better brain to see that is <br/>
SO NOT TRUE!!!<br/>
<br/>
Acknowledge what they are saying is VERY relevant and APPLICABLE to <br/>
THIER life, but not relevant to yours. <br/>
<br/>
Believe and  acknowledge and ACCEPT that your life IS different, and <br/>
as such will have different needs.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Actually, the only person who agrees with me is my husband. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Good, if your husband believe you, then it must mean you&#39;re not <br/>
crazy LOL!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I have ONE friend who is also homeschooling, but she is really far <br/>
&gt;from  unschooling and sincerely thinks that teaching french and <br/>
&gt;mathematics to her kids is necessary.<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, acknowledge that her beliefs is true and sincerely RELEVANT <br/>
only to her life and her kids. Not you, and your kids.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If i say I believe eating alot of chillies is good for my body, it&#39;s <br/>
my cultural beliefs for centuries, does this means its&#39; good for you <br/>
too? NO!! Of course not, too much chillies might hurt you and give <br/>
you severe gastric problems. But then, why not, becuase it doesn&#39;t <br/>
hurt me, and my tummy&#39;s fine and my ancestors had fantastic <br/>
health??!!<br/>
<br/>
See what I mean? Look at it this manner. What is relevant and <br/>
perceived good for another person&#39;s mind, is not necessary good for <br/>
you and your kids. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ll say &quot;Amazing!! we never taught him anything, and already he&#39;s <br/>
passed his first reading test and didn&#39;t come out zero on his <br/>
maths!!&quot; Proves that he is not brain dead sitting around playing <br/>
games. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know your laws there, but if by testing and your son is <br/>
doing enough to fullfill the criteria, so then it is enough. There <br/>
is no need to do anymore, to show who?!<br/>

the compulsory testing ...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re tired, You&#39;re burnt out. You&#39;re not that convinced if you&#39;re <br/>
doing the right thing. Whihc is why when EVERYONE IS TELLING and <br/>
SHOWING YOU SO.  <br/>
<br/>
You &quot;allowed&quot; their opinion to make you think you&#39;re doing wrong. <br/>
Whcih is why they succeed into making you feel like a failure, <br/>
because you, yourself is not sure of yourself.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re giving them the impression that you don&#39;t really know what <br/>
you&#39;re doing, which is why you&#39;re get all this un-solicited advise. <br/>
<br/>
Be confident. Exudes it and show them you&#39;re happy with what you&#39;re <br/>
doing. Don&#39;t get drawn into moaning about anything the kids is NOT <br/>
doing. Stay clamed up until your confident enough to flaunt your <br/>
unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But if you have to share, share good things. I find sharing little <br/>
happy things works like a dream, like his Lego buidling, his fire <br/>
burning activities, my son&#39;s great sense of money counting. <br/>
<br/>
Infact, when I start rattling off al these good and happy moments,  <br/>
it usually never fails to start the other mothers off,  moaning <br/>
about thier kid&#39;s in-competencies!! <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m amazed by how many parents always fails to see the best in their <br/>
kids, instead always highlights thier kid&#39;s &quot;not doing enough&quot; <br/>
moments!   <br/>
<br/>
My favourite is mentioning which grade of Jumpstart (pc educational <br/>
games that my kid likes) program my kid&#39;s on. He&#39;s 8, and is between <br/>
Grade 3-5. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How is it for you ? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My family&#39;s unschooling success is due to conviction, determination <br/>
and PROUD TO BE DIFFERENT!!<br/>
<br/>
I do flaunt that we are different, and we enjoy it. I am rebellious <br/>
to start off with. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; What is the&gt; part of your inner resources ?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My son is the focus of my determination. Read what I&#39;ve written to <br/>
Christie&#39;s post of &quot;1st week into unschooling&quot; , and you&#39;ll <br/>
understand that I am passionate about nurturing my son&#39;s uniqueness. <br/>
And nothing will deter or convince me otherwise, for I am following <br/>
my son&#39;s lead in his unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
This is what I call trusting your kids. Allowing you kid to grow and <br/>
florish the way they deemed fit, and YOU, being the mother, should <br/>
be like the Lioness, fiercely protecting them and ensuring that they <br/>
have the best possible and safe environment to grow up in, without <br/>
any other busybody&#39;s interferring opinion and beliefs. <br/>
<br/>
Think it this way, if your kid is a lion cub, you wouldn&#39;t allow the <br/>
Baa Baa Sheep Mummy to tell you that you need to fed your kids grass <br/>
and teach them to live happily and contently by grazing thier life <br/>
away on sweet grass, would you? <br/>
<br/>
Of course NOT. Your kids are lions! And should do what Lions do. <br/>
Play and hunt! Not eat grass!!!<br/>
<br/>
So be that Lioness now! Trust you can do no wrong by protecting them <br/>
from this &quot;controlling, generic brainwashed world&quot;. Trust that you <br/>
can do no harm to your kids, no matter how stupid you were in maths <br/>
(in this case, I&#39;m referring to myself LOL!!) <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; What are the required qualities for being a unschooling mom, an <br/>

<br/>
Patience, determination and thick skin LOL!! <br/>
<br/>
LOVE - Great love for your kids, and the determination to give them <br/>
the best, which is what you&#39;re already doing by unschooling them. <br/>
<br/>
Keep this in FOCUS. Write it down and paste it up! LOVE. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I live exactly on the school path, a few block away from the school, <br/>
and everyone around me goes to school. I&#39;m the only unschooling <br/>
mother, amongst all the homeschooling groups we attend. But <br/>
my &quot;structured&quot; homescooling friends still happily shares what they <br/>
are doing in thier lives, and I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m any of a lesser <br/>
mother that they are, just because I don&#39;t do lessons. <br/>
<br/>
I am happy to hear what they are doing, because it&#39;s what they <br/>
believe and obviously thrived in. It works for them, so I&#39;m happy <br/>
for them. But because I have this &quot;i&#39;m happy and proud we don&#39;t do <br/>
lessons&quot; approach, they are equally happy to accept me for what I <br/>
am - The Wierd One!!! LOL!! <br/>
<br/>
But I am happy being the wierd one out!! LOL!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I believe it&#39;s time that you should stop worrying about not being <br/>
fit enough to unschool, and just live your life the way you want. <br/>
<br/>
I do think you have yet to unschool yourself too, so go on, take a <br/>
year long sabbatical from being a conventional &quot;do it right mum&quot; and <br/>
just melt and fall apart. Be un-conventional for once. <br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re being too hard on yourself by measuring what you&#39;re <br/>
doing and not doing. By listening to what other people said, is you <br/>
measuring yourself againt thier judgement. <br/>
<br/>
To me unschooling is about being our trueselves, being individuals, <br/>
being unique, and this cannot possibly be measured against anything.<br/>

Once you understand that, everything will fall in place naturally <br/>
and painlessly.  <br/>

Hope this helps.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That was *my* biggest hurdle, in terms of trust, too, early in my <br/>
unschooling journey. To some extent, time was the biggest help. The <br/>
more I could see my kids growing and learning and becomming, despite <br/>
me sometimes! the easier it was to trust that I really could be their <br/>
partner, imperfect as I am. <br/>
<br/>
To some extent, our very imperfection is one of the great gifts we <br/>
have to give our children - because they get to see real grown up <br/>
people learning through living. That&#39;s not something school can <br/>
offer, or even &quot;do it bc I&#39;m the mom&quot; parenting. Its a plus, I <br/>
promise!<br/>
<br/>
What does it take to be an effective unschooling parent? My list is <br/>
different from yours:<br/>
<br/>
Being willing to appologise.<br/>
Being willing to change your mind.<br/>
<br/>
Having an idea of what your principles/core values are. That&#39;s pretty <br/>
important. It gives you a place to start figuring out how you want to <br/>
act/respond - and catching yourself when you go &quot;wrong&quot; by your own <br/>
standards. Then, if necessary, you can appologise and change your <br/>
mind. <br/>
<br/>
Being willing to ask for input, even when you Know, by means of your <br/>
fantastic mom-powers, what&#39;s best ;)<br/>
<br/>
Being authentic. By which I mean, be yourself. Hopefully your best <br/>
self, but if not... well, you still get to appologise and change your <br/>
mind. Knowing your principles is a big help, here. If you know what&#39;s <br/>
important to you, its easier to work towards being your best self. <br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; school, why HOMEschooling is so much better than UNschooling, why<br/>
&gt; diplomas are so important in our world and so on and so forth<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As your trust in yourself builds, this will get easier. Have a good <br/>
understanding of your principles will help, too. Something else that <br/>
helps is to *sound* confident when you talk about your family. Don&#39;t <br/>
fall into the habit of venting about your kids as a way to connect <br/>
with others - as you can see, it leaves you feeling cruddy about <br/>
yourself and your family. Tell happy stories. Tell funny stories only <br/>
if they don&#39;t put anyone down. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Actually, the only person who agrees with me is my husband. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Great! If you need to vent, vent to him. But also be sure to heap him <br/>
with love and appreciation - its sooooooo great to have a partner who <br/>
is supportive.<br/>
