<div id="ygrps-yiv-1716794316">&quot;My Paul Mercurio story is entirely in the realm of gossip. I worked<br/>
in the<br/>
Wardrobe of &quot;La Cage Aux Folles&quot; when it came to Australia from<br/>
Broadway, in<br/>
1984.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What a fun splay to be involved with! Cool.<br/>
<br/>
Every time I see you and James, we&#39;re so focused on unschooling/kids,<br/>
I never get to ask you about behind the scenes stories. I bet between<br/>
the two of you, there&#39;s quite a few interesting stories...even without<br/>
the theatre/actor connections.;)<br/>
<br/>
I really wish you lived closer Robyn..I need to pick that costume<br/>
design brain of yours. Sierra ADORES altering clothing and coming up<br/>
with costume ideas.<br/>
