<div id="ygrps-yiv-1216040251">hi all,<br/>
<br/>
i joined a few weeks ago and have really enjoyed reading all this; had no idea there was <br/>
this whole world of &quot;whole life&quot; unschooling out there; i thought i was joining a schooling-<br/>
related unschooling list, if you know what i mean!<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;ve got two kids; dd is a few months from 4 and ds has just turned 1. they LOVE each <br/>
other. and i mean LOOOVE. but of course sometimes we have toy snatching, exploratory <br/>
hitting, play that&#39;s fun for one person but not for others (tackling, body holding, etc). so <br/>
far, we have ended the inappropriate behaviors on both sides physically when talking <br/>
didn&#39;t work (this usually involves pulling a grasping dd off of a crying ds, who HATES <br/>
having his body physically restrained, even if it&#39;s in one of dd&#39;s pretend games). we&#39;ve <br/>
talked and talked to her about why these things are no fun for him, and noted that he&#39;s <br/>
crying etc, and often she&#39;ll let go herself, but sometimes we still have to pull her off him, <br/>
and sometimes there are incidents in which she&#39;s hit him and then run off, or look at us; <br/>
seemingly for no reason at all (as far as we know, all needs are met, etc).<br/>
<br/>
SO, here are my questions. how do you handle snatching without ever removing the toy <br/>
from the snatcher&#39;s hands? if it were just about not punishing the snatcher, it&#39;d be one <br/>
thing, but it clearly (in our family) teaches the snatchee to snatch; and anyways, there&#39;s no <br/>
reason for the snatchee to be punished (by having his/her toy removed) just because the <br/>
other kiddo wants to snatch. i love lots of the things i&#39;ve read here and elsewhere, but <br/>
most are aimed towards older kids. dd is getting to an age where she can discuss things <br/>
rationally (well, sometimes), but sometimes she&#39;s &quot;inspired&quot; by ds to be &quot;little&quot;. and <br/>
sometimes they&#39;re so hysterical together that she won&#39;t listen to me. which is fine until he <br/>
gets clobbered in the head with something hard, for the umpteenth time. how do you <br/>
handle these not-quite-safety issues with little kids? if i had a kid running for the oven, i&#39;d <br/>
physically restrain the child. but i feel yucky getting in a pulling battle over a snatched toy <br/>
with a freaking out child, not to mention pulling a screaming little girl off her crying <br/>
brother. is there any more gentle way to handle these things?<br/>
<br/>
sorry this is incredibly verbose; my head is only half screwed on this morning. ;)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Being proactive is really helpful, here - and ounce of prevention, <br/>
as they say. Be right there with them - down on the floor and <br/>
everything. Then you have a better chance to see the moment coming <br/>
and help them *ask* for what they want.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; if it were just about not punishing the snatcher, it&#39;d be one <br/>

&gt;snatch;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You have two very young kids who may not have the best <br/>
communications skills in the world, yet. Grabbing something is an <br/>
easy way to get what they want - its not necessarily a matter <br/>
of &quot;teaching&quot;. If the goal is &quot;get x&quot; snatching works. <br/>
<br/>
So the key is to help them communicate - help them discover more <br/>
tools, more ways of getting needs met, so they don&#39;t need to default <br/>
to snatching. At their ages, alot of that is going to come from <br/>
modelling, rather than showing or explaining. Once again, being <br/>
right there in the middle of things is going to be your best <br/>
strategy - even when things are running smoothly! <br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; other kiddo wants to snatch.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Part of moving away from punishment involves moving away from <br/>
asigning the lables of &quot;punishment&quot; and &quot;reward&quot; to random acts and <br/>
events. If your dh unthinkingly leaves the seat up, is he punishing <br/>
you? No, but you&#39;re probably irritated anyway. See the grabbing as a <br/>
bit thoughtless, a less-than-stellar means of communication, but not <br/>
intentionally unkind. <br/>
<br/>
It may be the snatchee will be happy with some other toy, especially <br/>
the little one, or that some other solution can be reached. <br/>
Depending on what&#39;s being snatched, maybe you just need duplicates <br/>
of some favorite toys. Or maybe you can have some special items <br/>
stashed away for moments when both kids want the same toy - bubbles <br/>
are a good quick-fix for some kids. Whipped cream. You just need to <br/>
break the tension.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She *is* little. Four is little. I have a 13yo and sometimes I have <br/>
to remind myself how young that really is. At the risk of sounding <br/>
repetitive, being right there with them helps to stop these kinds of <br/>
situations from starting in the first place. Encouraging kids to <br/>
communicate with one another, and filling in meaning for them when <br/>
they are struggling for words, helps them have more skills to <br/>
diffuse these kinds of things themselves, over time. Sometimes kids <br/>
need seemingly obvious pieces of information, like &quot;ouch means I <br/>
don&#39;t like that&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found it helpful to have a word or phrase that I can use <br/>
quickly in over-the-top moments - in our house its &quot;stop&quot; <br/>
and/or &quot;stop means stop&quot;. Danielle&#39;s is nicer, she uses &quot;No thank <br/>
you&quot;. With very little kids, using a firm tone - not necessarily <br/>
loud or angry, but firm - can work wonders. Kids who are <br/>
overstimulated seem to take a few extra seconds to process actual <br/>
words sometimes, so tone is important. Also important is using <br/>
your &quot;quicky phrase&quot; in less over-the-top moments, so you can <br/>
encourage them to say it to each other. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; is there any more gentle way to handle these things?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When all else fails and you find yourself physically separating your <br/>
kids, appologise. Appologise in the moment if you think anyone will <br/>
hear it, but absolutely appologise after the fact, when they and you <br/>
have calmed down. Let them know that you didn&#39;t know what else to do <br/>
to keep them from getting hurt. With your 4yo, you can then ask for <br/>
suggestions and do some brainstorming for the future. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-343915705">My older kids love to tell the &quot;share story&quot; at our house.... when<br/>
they were all little.. I had 3 kids in 5 yrs there was the constant<br/>
wrangling for the much coveted toy of the moment.   My rule has always<br/>
been that I do not intervene by awarding one child the toy when they<br/>
argue or tussle over something... I suggest possible solutions but I<br/>
have always felt that I can&#39;t really get involved in a sibling dispute<br/>
without choosing sides (at least in appearance to the child who feels<br/>
they lost!)  so I work towards meeting everyone&#39;s needs by suggesting<br/>
solutions (no swooping in and taking the toy and announcing NOW NO ONE<br/>
has it! like my sister in law was fond of doing to her kids!)  If one<br/>
toy is always the favorite I buy one for each kid... it&#39;s just<br/>
torturing them otherwise!   Anyway my kids worked out for themselves<br/>
that when they were playing if they wanted to switch toys they would<br/>
call out &quot;share&quot; and everyone would trade.    My then 4 yr old mostly<br/>
non verbal child with autism would shriek &quot;SHARE&quot;  which meant she<br/>
wanted it ALL! HA!   She would chase down the other two yelling SHARE<br/>
and practically tackle them and wrest away the toy she wanted totally<br/>
missing the &quot;trading&quot; part of the equation!   They were good natured<br/>
about it even as wee ones because they knew she didn&#39;t understand that<br/>
part of the game. Even now when they want all of something they will<br/>
call out &quot;SHARE!&quot; in the same little squeaky voice their sister had at<br/>
that age and then crack up in evil laughter!  <br/>
