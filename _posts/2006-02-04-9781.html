<div id="ygrps-yiv-1050443952">I just wanted to add something to the many posts.  There was a time <br/>
when I was extremely frustrated with my kids leaving their trash <br/>
wherever they were, they just dropped it where they were sitting.  And <br/>
the clothes, wherever they took it off that is where it stayed.  I <br/>
remember calling Ren and venting my frustration.  She said &quot;Why don&#39;t <br/>
you just make it really easy for them by putting little trash cans in <br/>
the areas where they seem to drop their trash.&quot;  Duh!!!  It seemed to <br/>
simple but I couldn&#39;t get past the tools I was given as a child.  <br/>
Somehow my kids were lazy and uncaring when really they just had a <br/>
hard time leaving what they were doing to throw something in the <br/>
trash.  <br/>
