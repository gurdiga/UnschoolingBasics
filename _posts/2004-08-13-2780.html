<div id="ygrps-yiv-1604114595">&quot;So, Ren, how much rain y&#39;all expecting there in the next 24 hrs?  I&#39;ve seen the <br/>
hurricane news and thought of you, tho I really don&#39;t know where Pensacola is. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Absolutely none.:)<br/>
The hurricane that is affecting our southern neighbors so severely, has made our lives more pleasant. It&#39;s pulled a cold front down, and we made a record low of 66 degrees last night. The high today was 83 degrees with LOW humidity...unheard of in mid-August. I just came home from work and it felt like OCTOBER out there. Totally awesome. I just wish it didn&#39;t come at such a high price for others. We&#39;ll get our turn eventually.....<br/>
