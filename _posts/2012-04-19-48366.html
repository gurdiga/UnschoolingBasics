<div id="ygrps-yiv-1449212307">Hello fellow travelers,<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so my daughter (11) is a prolific writer. She writes poetry, she writes short stories, she makes medical records forms, and she writes plays. My question is this. When she is sharing her work do I in anyway suggest that she write with punctuation? Or do I trust that punctuation will happen when she is ready? I love it that she is so engaged to writing (reading, too), and I love it when she shares w/me. Thoughts?<br/>
<br/>
Warm Regards,<br/>

<br/>
It really depends on her - does she Want that kind of information and feedback, or will it get in her way in the moment? I periodically offer my daughter (10) comments about things like punctuation, and will even go through, with her permission, and punctuate a piece of her writing so that it&#39;s easier for me to read - she Wants her work to be readable! but I don&#39;t make a big deal about it, and I drop the subject if she seems to be getting annoyed.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when she writes she&#39;s really conscious of using punctuation, other times she&#39;s more interested in getting all the stuff down in print. She understands about drafts and editing - she does similar things when she draws, sketching in a rough form and then going over it darker when she&#39;s found lines she likes. She has also seen me write and draw, and I&#39;ve talked with her a little about the fact that revising is something writers and artists do regularly - so she doesn&#39;t get hung up thinking something is &quot;wrong&quot;. But like I said, sometimes she doesn&#39;t want any kind of &quot;this would help&quot; feedback - she just wants me to read it and smile. Usually, that happens when she&#39;s still working on a draft, but not always, so I try to offer any comments with a lot of attention to her reaction so I can stop if that&#39;s not helpful to her in the moment. <br/>

It&#39;s very likely when she brings something she&#39;s saying &quot;Look at this cool thing I accomplished!&quot; and not &quot;Could you critique this for me?&quot; ;-)<br/>
<br/>
If she wants punctuation and grammar help she&#39;ll ask specifically because those are the questions she&#39;s exploring then.<br/>
<br/>
*But* as Meredith pointed out, grammar and punctuation serve practical purposes. So if something&#39;s honestly confusing you, mention it as you would to a friend. Like &quot;I&#39;m not getting this part.&quot; Or  &quot;I think a period here would help make it clear these are two separate things you&#39;re talking about.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So make it about you and your understanding rather than about her and her lack of knowledge.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1654166184">Thank you both for some great insight.  My initial reaction was to critique, but I didn&#39;t want to squash her creativity. I like the perspective of me asking for help reading her stuff. Thanks!<br/>
