My daughter mostly enjoys going to kindergarten.  Before kindergarten she<br/>
had no friends.  I am a bit of a homebody and we don&#39;t have neighbors, just<br/>

What state are you in? Have you checked out any local homeschool groups? My <br/>
kids have never lacked for friends since leaving school because we became very <br/>
involvd in local activities.<br/>
