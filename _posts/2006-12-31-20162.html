I have that!! Is that OCD? I have other symptoms like that too. I will<br/>
have to do some research.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-501038878">I sent this link to the list a couple days ago, but I never saw it show up.<br/>
<br/>
I recently stopped taking Zoloft for anxiety/depression. One thing I (well,<br/>
my husband more than me, really) noticed was a lot of the OCD things that I<br/>
do or think about stopped or were greatly lessened while on the medication.<br/>
After stopping the meds the OCD stuff as all come right back.. if nothing<br/>
else it is interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Because I don&#39;t want to be on medication anymore I was searching the<br/>
internet and found a site on OCD that has a self-help section ...<br/>

<br/>
Maybe that will help some of you.<br/>
