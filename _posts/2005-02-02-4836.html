<div id="ygrps-yiv-1694000360">&quot;So I guess it&#39;s okay to ignore all the stuff about your kids <br/>
needing to<br/>
be well-rounded and let them round themselves however they like<br/>
(barring requirements from the school dept.)? &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ooh.....you&#39;re including requirements from the school dept.? Yuck!!<br/>
That&#39;s not going to bring you any closer to unschooling Julie. Try <br/>
to live as though school didn&#39;t exist, including <br/>
their &quot;requirements&quot;, which even schooled kids may not understand!<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re trying to keep school requirements in your lives, that <br/>
would probably keep you from enjoying LIFE. Unschoolers have decided <br/>
that school requirements STOP learning from happening, why would we <br/>
want to hang onto any of it?<br/>
