<div id="ygrps-yiv-26958395">You all aren&#39;t giving her want she wants and she isn&#39;t giving you all <br/>
what you want, and nobody&#39;s going to admit to being overly-critical or <br/>
overly-sensitive so can we get on with another topic.  Such as:<br/>
<br/>
did you know MIT offers OpenCourseWare (free classes) over the internet <br/>
for anyone?  You can&#39;t get credit for the classes, but when my 11yo <br/>
daughter asked this week if she could take some college classes online <br/>
(she&#39;s been watching a show with college kids on it), I said, &quot;Sure&quot; <br/>
and we went to the website, she picked something she like (Playwriting) <br/>
and has gotten busy.<br/>
<br/>
Just thought you&#39;d like to know about that option in case any of you <br/>
have kids who are so inclined!<br/>
