<div id="ygrps-yiv-1143466649">I have shared similar problems with my two little ones. Really like  <br/>
Joyce&#39;s reply. Also wanted to share some of my favorite parenting  <br/>
books: Adele Faber&#39;s How to Talk So Kids Will Listen, Listen So Kids  <br/>
Will Talk. Naomi Aldort&#39;s Raising Our Children, Raising Ourselves. (www.authenticparent.com <br/>
). And Alfie Cohn&#39;s Unconditional Parenting. These books have really  <br/>
helped get to that place with my kids that Joyce described.<br/>
