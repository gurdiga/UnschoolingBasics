<div id="ygrps-yiv-1552932572">I read the book. I thought it was very eye opening and gives you several scenarios of both an argument that may exist at your home and a potential argument diffused with the right words and emotions behind them.<br/>
<br/>
The book also talks about how things that happen between siblings as children does in fact remain with them as adults. Like for instance, one sister being told she is smart while the other pretty. Well intentioned compliments - but after hearing it a time or two, it leaves one feeling only smart and the other only pretty. Then as adults we try to make up for that with/through our own kids.  <br/>
<br/>
I recommend reading it and was lucky enough to find it at the library. I never thought my 11 and 4 year old would fight like they were but after trying a few things, it has drastically changed for the better.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-29631187"> <br/>
I love this book!  My 5 yo and 3 yo girls have benefited so much from the ideas that I&#39;ve used from this book.....I especially like their idea of having confidence that kids can work things out with support from you.  It&#39;s amazing how they resolve conflict between themselves (sometimes!) naturally now, sometimes without my help.....My 12 you dd and 10 yo ds do not have as many conflicts as the younger two, but the techniques apply to all ages.  It&#39;s also a good book to read one chapter or chunk of at a time....I really have a hard time finding long stretches to really get into a book, but this one you can do a little at a time and then move on.<br/>
HTH!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-707116570">Lots of nice things about the book - it breaks down developmental <br/>
stages kids typically go through *with respect to sibling <br/>
relationships* which is so very helpful. There&#39;s even a section that <br/>
gives some examples of how different stages of development interact - <br/>
useful in helping parents see things from the perspective of Both kids. <br/>
I also like the way many of the examples are given in &quot;comic strip&quot; <br/>
format - makes it easy to skim through or read in the bathroom ;)<br/>

<h4>Gina Ladd</h4>
<p><small><time>15 Nov 2008, at  8:11am</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-33921321">My name is Gina and I have 5 children.  The oldest (22) is out on her own<br/>
going to college.  The others (14yob, 10yob, 8yog, 6yog) are still at home<br/>
and we have fallen into unschooling and love it.  I am amazed at how well<br/>
they learn on their own.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My question, our 14yo son is into vex robotics and chemical reactions J  I<br/>
have looked online and can&#39;t seem to find chemicals to buy for him.  Is<br/>
there a local hobby shop, or a specific place online I can buys some of this<br/>
stuff.  I don&#39;t want a chemistry &quot;kit&quot; .   He doesn&#39;t ever follow kits and<br/>
is definitely a free-thinking and thinks so far outside the box that the box<br/>
is nowhere to be seen.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
He saw an experiment with sodium acetate, so now he wants that J  I would<br/>
like to put together my own &quot;kit&quot; for him for Christmas with items he can<br/>
use in his experiments.  I already know baking soda and vinegar will be in<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Also, does anyone know if there&#39;s a local place to buy Vex robotics parts?<br/>
<br/>

Thanks for any help.  If these questions have been asked before, please<br/>
point me in the right direction.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1333359722">I went to Amazon to check out the Sibling Rivalry book. Amazon suggested<br/>
that I might also &quot;enjoy&quot; the following book:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Setting Limits with Your Strong-Willed Child : Eliminating Conflict by<br/>
Establishing Clear, Firm, and Respectful Boundaries&quot; by Robert MacKenzie<br/>
<br/>
Just the title made we want to SCREAM! There are over 100 reviewers praising<br/>
this book as the answer to their prayers with such thoughts as:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Everyday annoying behavior such as whining or nagging are solved by using a<br/>
chip system where the child is constantly reminded by an external symbol<br/>
(chips in a jar) to modify their responses. I love what the book says about<br/>
rewards vs punishment, too. Rewards say to the child &quot;If you comply, you get<br/>
a reward, but your response is optional.&quot; Punishments REQUIRE compliance,<br/>
they are always administered, because the parental response IS NOT OPTIONAL.<br/>
You have to perservere! This system takes work, but once in place, you will<br/>
see quicker results because the child is respecting your authority and<br/>
respecting and internalizing your values. Trust me, this system with a lot<br/>
of praise for your child when they do the right thing will go a long way in<br/>
developing their character!&quot;<br/>

Having said that, there may be some online resources someone can post that could be useful to you and others, too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Its rough to be 4. Four yr olds want a Lot of autonomy - which isn&#39;t <br/>
quite the same as independence. They want exactly as much <br/>
independence as they want, and not one jot more. They want exactly as <br/>
much help and information as they want, and not one bit more. <br/>
Naturally, another 4yo can be a very grating person at this time! <br/>
<br/>
Anything you can do to make the whole household more &quot;kid friendly&quot; <br/>
will help reduce the overall stress level. Look around and try to see <br/>
how many times a day your kids can&#39;t do or get something they want <br/>
without needing help of some kind - every one of those is a challenge <br/>
to be overcome. That can get frustrating. So a certain amount of the <br/>
bickering you&#39;re seeing is &quot;last straws&quot; iykwim. <br/>
<br/>
4yos are also just starting to become aware of their environment on a <br/>
whole new level, including the people in that environment. They tend <br/>
to be a bit more interactive than they were at 3 - and you have two <br/>
of them with the same new level of awareness, new level of <br/>
interactiveness, and same Lack of social skills - and not much <br/>
empathy, besides. They&#39;re still communicating and problem solving at <br/>
a pretty basic level. The more you can do to be right there with <br/>
them, down on the floor, in the middle of things, smoothing over the <br/>
rough spots, the more modelling they&#39;ll have on which to base some <br/>
skills. Unfortunately, you don&#39;t have the luxury of distracting a <br/>
younger child - so your own skills are going to be streeeeeetched as <br/>
you figure out what helps your two. <br/>
<br/>
All that being said, don&#39;t disregard the possibility that they are <br/>
okay figuring things out on their own (at least some of the time) <br/>
squabbles and all. I&#39;m not saying to let them fight it out, <br/>
necessarily. But do be open to the idea that some of those squabbles <br/>
are how they&#39;re working on their relationship right now - and since <br/>
they&#39;re at the same level of development they may be more okay with <br/>
that than if they were even a year apart. <br/>

<br/>
Book Recommendations:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Chemistry in the Community<br/>
2. CHEMICAL DEMONSTRATIONS: A Handbook for Teachers of Chemistry<br/>
3. Chemistry for Every Kid: 101 Easy Experiments that Really Work<br/>
<br/>
You might get inspiration from these sites <br/>
<br/>
1.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.teachertube.com/uprofile.php?UID=20178">http://www.teachertube.com/uprofile.php?UID=20178</a><br/>

<br/>
Some fun activities I&#39;ve done:<br/>
<br/>
1.  growing crystals with various salts you can buy at the grocery or drug stores.  <br/>
2.  Making you own litmus paper, use radish, red cabbage, blackberry and more for the <br/>
pigments.  Google there are more ideas on the net<br/>
3.  Non-Newtonian Fluid - there are tons of applications you can explore like bouncing <br/>
things off the liquid, different concentrations, see what floats and what sinks.<br/>
4.  Get a water quality test kit from your favorite aquarium store and test/monitor/track <br/>
water quality in nearby streams and ponds.  Compare results before rain and after rain, in <br/>
the day and at night, upstream to downstream of an &quot;influence&quot; , 2 different streams and <br/>
etc, endless opportunities.<br/>
5.  Extract essential oils from herbs - more organic chem but it&#39;s safe and easy.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2077423021">Thanks for your replies.  It&#39;s been about 6 weeks now.  With the holidays<br/>

thought I was on one, but that is fine.  I have learned so much from just<br/>
reading the notes.<br/>

Gina, you probably should ask on a local list for &quot;local&quot; hobby shops. This<br/>
is an international list &lt;g&gt;. <br/>
<br/>
Having said that, there may be some online resources someone can post that<br/>
could be useful to you and others, too.<br/>
<br/>
And, if you tell us where you live, local folks can respond privately to<br/>
you.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My question, our 14yo son is into vex robotics and chemical reactions J I<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2031583718">Good sources for chemicals are:<br/>
<br/>
www.fishersci.com (Fisher Scientific)  They have a section for Sci Ed, where you can get less expensive versions of lab chemicals.<br/>
<br/>
also www.vwrsp.com<br/>
<br/>
Both of these places are where labs purchase chemicals.  Try calling to see what they can offer you for an educational discount.<br/>
<br/>
You could also contact a local University ans ask for their Science Education Department or their Education Department.  They may be able to help you with resources for the chemicals as well.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!  I was in Columbia, SC for 6 years...now in Florida.<br/>
