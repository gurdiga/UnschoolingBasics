<div id="ygrps-yiv-374510949">Apparently the study found that after only 3 months, every one of a dozen children (so 8.5%) treated with Ritalin had a three-fold increase in chromosome abnormalities associated with increased risks of cancer.  <br/>

I misread that to mean &#39;one out of every dozen&#39; which would mean 8%.  Upon re-reading it, they actually said &#39;every one of the dozen children&#39; in the study -- 100%! had a three-fold increase in abnormalities!  Yikes!<br/>
