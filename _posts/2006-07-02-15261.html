<div id="ygrps-yiv-1686467978">For the first time, that made sense lol.  So basically what you&#39;re saying is<br/>
that learning how to be in a family and be in relationships and live with<br/>
other people is part of learning so it&#39;s part of Unschooling.  Is that<br/>
right?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So true -<br/>
<br/>
In fact, it IS part of school curriculum in my state, at least. Take  <br/>
a look at this, from the CA Education Code:<br/>
<br/>
51220.5. (a) The Legislature finds and declares the following:<br/>
<br/>
(1) The family is our most fundamental social institution and the  <br/>
means by which we care for, prepare, and train our children to be  <br/>
productive members of society.<br/>
<br/>
(2) Social research shows increasingly that the disintegration of the  <br/>
family is a major cause of increased welfare enrollment, child abuse  <br/>
and neglect, juvenile delinquency, and criminal activity.<br/>
<br/>
(3) The lack of knowledge of parenting skills and the lack of  <br/>
adequate preparation to assume parental responsibilities are not only  <br/>
major causes of family disintegration, but also contribute  <br/>
substantially to the disastrous consequences of teen pregnancy.<br/>
<br/>
(4) Because the state government bears much of the economic and  <br/>
social burden associated with the disintegration of the family in  <br/>
California, the state has a legitimate and vital interest in  <br/>
adequately preparing its residents for parenthood.<br/>
<br/>
(b) The Legislature recognizes that the public education system is  <br/>
the most efficient and effective means to educate the populace on a  <br/>
large-scale basis, and intends, therefore, to use the public  <br/>
education system to ensure that each California resident has an  <br/>
opportunity to acquire knowledge of parenting skills prior to  <br/>
becoming a parent. That knowledge should include, at a bare minimum,  <br/>
all of the following:<br/>
<br/>
Child development and growth.<br/>
Effective parenting.<br/>
Prevention of child abuse.<br/>
Nutrition.<br/>
Household finances and budgeting.<br/>
Personal and family interaction and relations.<br/>
Methods to promote self-esteem.<br/>
Effective decision making skills.<br/>
Family and individual health.<br/>
(c) Commencing with the 1995-96 fiscal year, the adopted course of  <br/>
study for grade 7 or 8 shall include the equivalent content of a one- <br/>
semester course in parenting skills and education. All pupils  <br/>
entering grade 7 on or after July 1, 1995, shall be offered that  <br/>
course or its equivalent content during grade 7 or 8, or both. On or  <br/>
before January 1, 1995, the State Department of Education shall  <br/>
supply, to each school district that includes a grade 7 or 8, a  <br/>
sample curriculum suitable either for implementation as a stand-alone  <br/>
one-semester course or for incorporation within identified existing  <br/>
required or optional courses, with content designed to develop a  <br/>
knowledge of topics including, but not limited to, all of the following:<br/>
<br/>
Child growth and development.<br/>
Parental responsibilities.<br/>
Household budgeting.<br/>
Child abuse and neglect issues.<br/>
Personal hygiene.<br/>
Maintaining healthy relationships.<br/>
Teen parenting issues.<br/>
Self-esteem.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
