<div id="ygrps-yiv-1759029729">The Always Unschooled list is having a discussion about this book<br/>
right now, and I really loved the quote that someone posted over<br/>
there. I think it&#39;s really useful advice, but especially when you&#39;re<br/>
first starting out this unschooling path:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The happier I have allowed myself to be,<br/>
the happier my children have become.<br/>
The more I have become myself,<br/>
the more they have done the same&quot;<br/>
#62<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s something I didn&#39;t get in the beginning. Excavating my<br/>
authentic self, doing that which is within me, BEing the ME I was<br/>
meant to be, has translated into a much happier household with<br/>
children that follow their bliss.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a hard process to describe. When folks start asking about how to<br/>
help their children learn, how to make sure they cover the &quot;basics&quot; or<br/>
how to trust their children, I think some of the best advice is to<br/>
quit focusing on the children!! That doesn&#39;t mean &quot;don&#39;t pay attention<br/>
to them&quot; because connecting with your children is paramount.<br/>
<br/>
It means quit FOCUSING on how to get to a certain place, or how to GET<br/>
kids to do anything. Just be with them. Focus instead on your own<br/>
passions and interests. Pull your children into that which brings you<br/>
absolute JOY. Experience the beauty of YOU.<br/>
<br/>
As children grow, they need models of a passionate, interesting and<br/>
rich life. They need to see what a beautiful life looks like! Give<br/>
them that model in yourself and watch the learning unfold.:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1425797964">I have this book Ren. I forgot how wonderful it is. Time to dust it off and reread it. :o) I so agree that connecting to myself has helped me connect to my children.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s another good unschooling verse. <br/>
It&#39;s #1 Words of Life:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You can speak to your children of life,<br/>
but your words are not life itself.<br/>
You can show them what you see,<br/>
but your showing and their seeing<br/>
are forever different things.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
further along in the same verse:<br/>
<br/>
&quot; Go for a slow and mindful walk.<br/>
Show them every little thing that catches your eye.<br/>
Notice evey little thing that catches theirs.<br/>
Don&#39;t look for lessons or seek to teach great things.<br/>
Just notice.<br/>
The lesson will teach itself.&quot;<br/>

&quot;The miracle is not to walk on water. The miracle is to walk on the<br/>
green earth, dwelling deeply in the present moment and feeling truly<br/>
alive.&quot;<br/>
