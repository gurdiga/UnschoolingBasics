<div id="ygrps-yiv-342842374">I watched the first half and then I had to turn it off. It was makeing me so mad!!!!<br/>
She tell them that dad going to put every single kid to sleep was harming them emotionally and that they were TOO attached.....<br/>

I just could not listen to it anymore.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-42994881">Maybe between all of us, we&#39;ve seen the whole show.  I saw the second half<br/>
of it.  <br/>
<br/>
I thought it was sad that the dad enjoyed lying with his kids while they<br/>
fell asleep and the nanny thought it was so wrong. She felt he was doing it<br/>
out of his own insecurities but he said he was doing it because he never<br/>
went to be feeling safe and loved and he wanted his kids to have the feeling<br/>
he didn&#39;t have as a kid.  <br/>
<br/>
I thought that was valid. It wasn&#39;t like he was needy and they weren&#39;t. They<br/>
were just little boys and they needed their dad as much as he needed them.  <br/>
<br/>
Apparently though it wasn&#39;t working for the mom because she wanted alone<br/>
time with her dh after the kids were in bed and when he put them to bed, she<br/>
didn&#39;t get that.  Too bad she couldn&#39;t get the time she needs with her dh<br/>
another time and let the dad have that time with his kids that they all<br/>
seemed to enjoy.  <br/>
<br/>
My kids love those shows and I have to say I find them intriguing in a way<br/>
but they make me crazy at the same time. I do have to say though that the<br/>
families that are usually on there have improved relationships after the<br/>
nanny helps.  It&#39;s just that they have SO MUCH further to go to get to a<br/>
respectful relationship and that is never addressed.  The punishment and<br/>
reward system seems to be the be all end all.  :(<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1764822056">The focus wasn&#39;t on the homeschooling (very school at home) at all thankfully..although the Nanny did insist on no animals in the classroom and she gave them some organizing things and a desk for the mom-as-teacher. The big thing was the bedtime routine where the boys needed Daddy to lay beside each of them in order for them to fall asleep (Nanny made the parents let them cry it out); and the way the child named Seth was ending up left out of rough play with his dad and brothers (although apparently unintentionally), because he has Spina Bifida and a heart condition they didn&#39;t name. So the Nanny made certain that the Dad took time to be with Seth alone. <br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;ve never watched the show before; and I missed the beginning few minutes of it. I didn&#39;t agree with the crying-it-out tack with the bedtimes. <br/>
