<div id="ygrps-yiv-2009170591">Hey Kelly,<br/>
Don&#39;t forget we will be talking next year at the Conference in NC about it.;)<br/>
So you may have two more in your list!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
This was something DH and I started thinking about a year or so ago when a couple died around here and left a  2 year old baby.<br/>
My mom would be great but she is already 66 so that may not work if she passes away first and that she is not driving as much anymore. My MIL is a great grandmother but would be horrible for the kids to live with her and her new husband. I know how my dh&#39;s soul has been crushed by her soft spoke voice, he still thinks he is stupid and dam (sp) for not having an education. ( He did two years of College but says he learned nothing and wanted to be home with his cows farming)<br/>
She would be a big NO. My SIL , I love her but NO WAY as a parent. Punishments, punishments, etc You get the picture. I know how she was raised and how she raises her kids.<br/>
My sister I love her and bless her heart she tries. When I talk to her about parenting issues she seems to understand and agree but she cannot get it and use it. It took me years talking to her about not spanking and her agreeing now she finally stopped but still there is no way and her DH is a good guy but very mainstream.<br/>
I got a cousin that I love in NC that I think she may do good with help from the unschooling community. She has two kids that are living outside her house and a teenager still living with her.<br/>
I wish there were more unschooling families around here that I could meet ...<br/>
I would rather my kids went to school if the people were gentle parents than stay being homeschooled by authoritarians.<br/>
Alex<br/>

  Certainly a downer of a topic, but<br/>
  a necessary one none the less. Have some of you done this? Did you<br/>
  appoint family?<br/>
<br/>
  -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Absolutely not.<br/>
<br/>
  We redid our wills the day after Cameron&#39;s 18th birthday last year. He <br/>
  is now listed as Duncan&#39;s guardian.<br/>
<br/>
  But before that, we&#39;d chosen two childless friends. Patrick is a <br/>
  sociology prof at the unversity. his wife, Gillian, is the head of a <br/>
  private school. Back then, if we were both to die, Pat & Gill would get <br/>
  both boys. One of them would quit teaching to be 100% with the boys. <br/>
  They are still listed in our wills as guardians for Duncan if something <br/>
  were to also happen to Cameron. They are also listed as <br/>
  &quot;helpers/guide/resources&quot; for Cameron if he needed them.<br/>
<br/>
  No family members would do. Too strict and schooly---just wouldn&#39;t <br/>
  happen.<br/>
<br/>
  -=-=-=-=--<br/>
<br/>
  I know blood is thicker than water (or so the saying goes)<br/>
<br/>
  -=-=-=-=--<br/>
<br/>
  Maybe---but not around here. We have a very tightly-knit group of <br/>
  freinds who are closer to us than any of our family members (except <br/>
  maybe my dad---but he&#39;s to the *right* of Hitler in some ways! &lt;G&gt; We <br/>
  don&#39;t want the boys with him all the time either!). We figure we&#39;ve <br/>
  &quot;made&quot; a family of friends. Very close friends who are in so many ways <br/>
  closer than family.<br/>
<br/>
  So I don&#39;t buy that &quot;blood&quot; thingy! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  -=-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
  So how did you guys who have chosen a guardian decide on them?<br/>
<br/>
  -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  We put SOOOO much thought into it.<br/>
<br/>
  Now, we probbaly have enough unschooling friends we could ask. But at <br/>
  the time, we had to think of people we KNEW. The unschoolers we knew <br/>
  *OF* were scattered here and yon---and we didn;t *know* them IRL. Now, <br/>
  I&#39;d have a dozen families that I would consider a good match for the <br/>
  boys.<br/>
<br/>
  -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  And how did you go about putting your wishes in writing?<br/>
<br/>
  -=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
  Lawyer. Wills.<br/>
<br/>
  And we were VERY explicit about our wishes---not just that they&#39;d go to <br/>
  Patrick and Gillian, but that they would NOT go to any family members.<br/>
<br/>
  We also talked with the boys about it. They&#39;d rather stay in this house <br/>
  with friends they know looking in on them. That&#39;s the deal now.<br/>
<br/>
  -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  I have heard that something as serious as this should be done by a <br/>
  lawyer otherwise<br/>
  it can be contested quite easily.<br/>
<br/>
  -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  That was my concern. Ben&#39;s family and my parents would desperately want <br/>
  the boys. NOT a good match. Everyone knows our wishes. We&#39;ve spelled it <br/>
  out for all of them. The boys stay here.<br/>
<br/>
  I seriously suggest getting to know other unschooling families (very, <br/>
  very well) and work out things just in case.<br/>
<br/>
  I made the offer several years ago that I would be happy to take in <br/>
  anyone&#39;s unschooling child(ren). One family took me up on it, and we <br/>
  made it official in Albuquerque this past September. She is now <br/>
  officially our godchild.<br/>
<br/>
  The chances are SOOO slim that we would ever have to take her in, but <br/>
  the peace of mind that comes with such a commitment is amazing.<br/>

Recently i lost a friend. She was a mom of two girls (2 y/o &  8 <br/>
months). She went on a date with her husband and the kids stayed  with <br/>
her parents who were in town visiting. She was killed in a car  accident <br/>
on the way home. She and her husband were in separate cars  so he <br/>
survived. Just that quick her life was done. It&#39;s really made  me start <br/>
thinking about appointing guardians. Certainly a downer of  a topic, but <br/>
a necessary one none the less. Have some of you done  this? Did you <br/>
appoint family? I know blood is thicker than water (or  so the saying <br/>
goes) but none of our family sees life the same way we  do. We have <br/>
strong feelings on attachment parenting, veganism,  unschooling, etc. <br/>
Nobody in either of our families comes close to  even sharing any of <br/>
these. So how did you guys who have chosen a  guardian decide on them? <br/>
And how did you go about putting your  wishes in writing? I have heard <br/>
that something as serious as this  should be done by a lawyer otherwise <br/>

OH BOY OH BOY, Can I truly relate to your fear!!!!! I  don&#39;t have one single <br/>
person in my life (that I&#39;m related to) who  would raise my children if <br/>
something happened to me in a way that they  wish to be raised (as unschoolers) My <br/>
sister is a  super mother and has homeschooled her children until recently  but <br/>
she is VERY structured about it, they have tests, spelling  assignments, do <br/>
standardized evaluations every year, etc... My kids would  HATE THAT. My mom <br/>
who is 71 would do a great job but can you ask someone  of that age to raise <br/>
your children? My boyfriend would also do great but  how would he support them on <br/>
his own like that? I have a DEAR friend who  unschools too but she suffers <br/>
from health problems that would make it  impossible for her to raise her 3 kids <br/>
plus my 3. Biological dad isn&#39;t an  option at all. Its really a MESS. As a <br/>
result I am SOOOO careful about  everything I do. I used to enjoy riding and <br/>
jumping horses but now  find myself not even doing that in fear that the kids <br/>
could God  forbid loose me and then not be raised the same way. It is hard enough <br/>
as  it is when you are &quot;normal&quot; but when you have an alternative lifestyle  <br/>
(like ours) it makes things seem impossible. Sorry I don&#39;t have help for  you - <br/>
just sympathy. Also, I am sorry about your friend. That is awful!  Right now I <br/>
have a girl in my children&#39;s choir who lost her mom 3  years ago, and she is <br/>
a MESS. Parents were divorced before it happened,  mom was an awesome lady, <br/>
dad was always cheating and whoring around. For  some reason dad ended up with <br/>
the daughter and has a different lady at  home every 3 weeks. The little girl <br/>
is tortured. I would not be surprised  if she either ends up on drugs or worse. <br/>
She is the most emotionally  disturbed little girl I have ever met and the <br/>
sadness is so deep and dark  within her eyes that you feel like crying just <br/>
looking at her.  YUCK.<br/>
 <br/>
Sorry to be depressing.<br/>

We debated the guardians for a LONG time and kept putting it off. I<br/>
wanted one of my brothers but dh didn&#39;t feel comfortable with my SIL.<br/>
He wanted his mother, whom I was not comfortable. In the end, we chose<br/>
his mother AND his father (they are divorced). It&#39;s not the best<br/>
situation. Hopefully we never have to worry about it. But the reality<br/>
is that both grandparents are very involved in the kids lives. They<br/>
have had to deal with the issues of split custody with their own<br/>
children, and did it well, and they live fairly close (within an<br/>
hour). Neither of them are comfortable with homeschooling, let alone<br/>
unschooling but in the event of our passing, I would first and formost<br/>
want my children with the people they know and love the most and Who I<br/>
know has their best interests at heart. While it may not be the ideal<br/>
situation for schooling, at a time like that, I think having the<br/>
family connection would be more important. Of course, I would also<br/>
hope that the grandparents would abide by our and my children&#39;s wishes<br/>
to the extent they could. <br/>
<br/>
As for the legal aspect, we finally did ours in a rush (we went away<br/>
for the first time since becoming parents 6yrs ago). I typed a legal<br/>
sounding document - got ideas from the internet - and we had it<br/>
notorized. I&#39;m sure it probably isn&#39;t the best way to do it but in our<br/>
situation it will be fine. There will be no-one contesting our wishes. <br/>

  And I am raising grandkids in bad health.<br/>
  My 2 older sons (33 and 29) are about as far on the conventional side of parenting as you can get.(spankings,grounding,etc)<br/>
  My dd (my kids bio mother) has too many mental health issue&#39;s which is why we have the kids in the 1st place.<br/>
  My Dad is 7o yrs old,works 8 hrs a day,6 days a week and still farms,but he couldn&#39;t take on the kids.<br/>
  I am slowly meeting and forming friendships with other unschoolers,trying to take care of myself,and believing that all will work out perfectly!<br/>
  Peace on earth,<br/>

Dear Alison, <br/>
You are SO RIGHT. Unfortunately, no insurance company  will give me life <br/>
insurance. I had ALL (acute lymphocytic leuk) when I was  in my TWENTIES (I am <br/>
almost in my 40&#39;s now) and they still will not  write me a policy! I am so <br/>
totally in remission. As a matter of fact,  people I know who were never sick are <br/>
way more at risk for dropping  dead soon than I am being that I care for my body <br/>
with such great thought!  GRRR. It is such a disappointment :-(<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh!!!! That is SO frustrating!!!! I have severe rheumatoid arthritis.<br/>
My meds cost about $30k a year (they are the biologic injections). I<br/>
am basically uninsurable as an individual in the health insurance<br/>
industry. Either my dh or I have to keep full time status at jobs so<br/>
that I can have insurance (the group plans have to insure me, but<br/>
individual plans don&#39;t). I had to decrease hours because of my health<br/>
and went on COBRA, but that is expiring soon. We are trying hard to<br/>
get small group through my dh&#39;s business (he owns it but has no<br/>
employees, so it&#39;s tricky).<br/>
<br/>
My life insurance premiums are very high, but at least they will<br/>
insure me.   Is there a length of time that you have to be disease<br/>
free or will you forever be uninsurable?<br/>

YUCK!!!!!!!! My best friend (the unschooler I mentioned  that wasn&#39;t in good <br/>
enough health for me to leave my 3 kids with because  she already has THREE) <br/>
also has RA. She is doing that new very  controversial antibiotic therapy, have <br/>
you heard of it? So far the  results have been promising, but BOY can I <br/>
really relate as far as  her premiums are concerned. It costs her family $10,000 a <br/>
year just for  health insurance!<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t know if there is a period of time I can be in  remission for? From <br/>
what I remember, as long as I am being &quot;treated&quot; they  think of me as sick. The <br/>
drag is, I AM kind of being treated still but its  for anemia that is a result <br/>
of the medication I had to take to get better.  So it isn&#39;t like I see an <br/>
oncologist for anything awful or life  threatening, just for the anemia, but I do <br/>
see one, every 28 days and do  blood work that often as well. Its just their <br/>
way of keeping me ok.  :-(<br/>
