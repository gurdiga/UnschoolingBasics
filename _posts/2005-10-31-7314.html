*My mom  said the other day about my daughter, &quot;I suppose we would <br/>
have all<br/>
been  free like that had we been raised without so many rules.&quot;*<br/>
<br/>
And what is  wrong with being free?  Did she say that in a good way <br/>
or a bad  way?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
***************<br/>
 <br/>
This particular time she said it in a positive way, but she has certainly  <br/>
meant it negatively, too.<br/>
 <br/>
*****888And, yes, it is Jalen, my wonderful nephew!!!!  He is a  <br/>
hooooooooot!!!  And you know what is so great about him, and other  <br/>
kids like him?  He is VERY good at articulating what he needs, I  <br/>
love that!  There were times at the conference when he would come to  <br/>
Ren and say, &quot;Mom, I haven&#39;t seen you in a while and I NEEEEED  you.&quot;*****<br/>
 <br/>
One day, we drove by a strip center and it was busy with some sort of  little <br/>
exhibition of fire and rescue trucks.  My 5 year old wanted to go  and Nick, <br/>
9, did not.  After pleading him for a bit, Emmy said &quot;well, why  exactly to <br/>
you not want to go?  Maybe we can figure something out that  would work for both <br/>
of us?&quot;  Nick, who is very challenged in speech and  language thought for a <br/>
minute and said &quot;I don&#39;t like to talk to people I don&#39;t  know.&quot;  Emmy said, <br/>
&quot;Mom, can you talk for Nick?&quot;  I said of course and  she asked if that would work <br/>
for him.  He agreed and we went and had a  great time.<br/>
 <br/>
I loved it.   Emmy knew Nick was uncomfortable about something  and she <br/>
figured out how to help him articulate it.  He wasn&#39;t afraid  to express his fear.  <br/>
They both trusted me enough that I would hold up my  end of the solution and <br/>
not let him get into an uncomfortable situation.<br/>
 <br/>
For me, this small event was a huge deal.  How many different ways  this <br/>
could have gone and ending up with someone hurt or upset?  I had very  little to <br/>
do with their exchange, but I know how much work on my part laid the  ground <br/>
work for it.  I think it is things like this that a typical family  would gloss <br/>
over, they would think I was really lucky to have kids that get  along and <br/>
look out for each other.  But I know that every time I asked them  their opinion <br/>
and did my best to act on it gave them the freedom and  trust to solve a <br/>
problem and follow-through.  Something many adults  can&#39;t do!<br/>
