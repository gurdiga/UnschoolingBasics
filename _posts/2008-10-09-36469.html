<div id="ygrps-yiv-714429239">Hello unschoolers out there. I haven&#39;t posted lately or often but I<br/>
like to pop on and read postings.  I have some thoughts on my mind and<br/>
I feel that this group could help me.  First , I&#39;m mommy to to boys 6<br/>
year old Ian and 21/2 year old garret. I have been implementing<br/>
unschooling for at least 3 years now when my friend directed me to<br/>
this exact group for help with &quot;disciplining&quot; my oldest .  Wow was my<br/>
eyes opened. I stayed up lately reading post having major ah-hah<br/>
moments and fully understanding that why and how unschooling could<br/>
work.. I have slowly let go of some old baggage and implementing<br/>
saying yes more and my relationship with my children has change<br/>
tremendoulsy.  And usually when there is issues -- deep down there<br/>
mine... So here&#39;s my thoughts..<br/>
<br/>
How do I &quot;hold&quot; my own when there others around that implement what I<br/>
consider old parenting styles?  I would like to think that I am a<br/>
strong enough person to not be swayed but I find myself being a little<br/>
stricter when others are around if I don&#39;t watch myself.<br/>
<br/>
I also find myself just feeling more stressed.  Not at my kids but the<br/>
other parents.  Sometimes they will make comments , not really<br/>
directly &#39;attacking&#39; my style of parenting but I can sometimes feel<br/>
it.. or is that just me?? and my insecurities??<br/>
<br/>
I have found myself just irritated as shit when parents scold there<br/>
kids over things I really don&#39;t know why they are getting after them.<br/>
 For example, a friend and I are walking around our neighborhood and<br/>
our two boys are at the end of some ones driveway (to wait for us and<br/>
stay out of cars way) and they are just throwing stones up in the air.<br/>
 No biggy in my eyes.  they are not throwing them at anyone , but my<br/>
friend says don&#39;t so then I do. in my thoughts just out of respect but<br/>
then part of me is why???:? <br/>
<br/>
Oh and the other day a new friend is over with her 31/2 and 11/2 year<br/>
old boys and her solution to her boys whining/crying/not sharing is to<br/>
put in the corner (now I think she arrived at this conclusion because<br/>
her friend implements this technique and she feels that her friends<br/>
kids are great their 6, 4 and 15 months =-== well i just met her kids<br/>
yesterday and they just plan seem unhappy. they barely talk (not shy<br/>
because the girl kept coming to me and climbing up on my lap and<br/>
gravitating toward me all night), they are not at all &#39;rowdy&#39; which I<br/>
guess maybe my boys are just overly...  and I just sense a feeling of<br/>
sadness in them.  The mom even joked about that maybe she&#39;s just more<br/>
strict because when we  were talking about timing out and only going<br/>
by the minutes by the age of the child -- and she said she just makes<br/>
them stand there until she feels like letting them out of the time<br/>
out???)   Soooo am I just being overly judgemental... by all means I<br/>
am not a perfect parent , I&#39;m still controlling at  times, and yell<br/>
and have even hit my children (lots better though about controlling<br/>
that issue...) <br/>
<br/>
okay and since I&#39;m on a roll , let me vent about the time my cousin<br/>
was down here and right away -- I recieved comments about that there<br/>
should be routines and bedtimes and controls etc --- which truthfully<br/>
she may have all that implemented but I think some of the shit was a<br/>
front... basically on me about control and then one time I did over<br/>
exert myself with my boy -- she attacked that -- I shouldn&#39;t have done<br/>
that and if cps had seen that I would be in trouble.......and that I<br/>
shouldn&#39;t yell so much... Granted I shouldn&#39;t and since then even<br/>
though she pissed me off I haven&#39;t --- however I do know when i&#39;m<br/>
stressed I&#39;m harder on the boys (not an excuse just acknowledging and<br/>
willing to change).....However, I couldn&#39;t see where her harsh<br/>
controls were great -- yep she had a trained daughter but..<br/>
<br/>
Anyway I guess my ramblings are that I want to be accepted for my<br/>
choices as a parent and I want to except others also...Should I gently<br/>
suggested alternative ways to discipling? or just keep my mouth<br/>
shut???  I like advocating a more positive, peaceful way of parenting<br/>
however not everyone gets it?  So many just argue that we need to<br/>
control this or that etc??? so I usually just shut up?  Figure if I<br/>
just show them by actions maybe they will get it... when I have seen a<br/>
better way of handling a situation I see it and try it soo????<br/>
<br/>
anyway if I am making any sense at all please respond.  Its getting<br/>
where I don&#39;t want to even be around some parents.</div>

parenting.<br/>

you are doing the right thing for your kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2115728715">~~Its getting where I don&#39;t want to even be around some parents.~~<br/>
 <br/>
This has been my decision on more than one occasion.  Do I really want to be around parents who are not parenting respectfully and mindfully, and kids who are not happy??  The answer for me is a big resounding NO.  I find it very stressful being around a child being treated that way.  I&#39;m lucky because there are many of us here in Calgary, Canada, but I don&#39;t like every one of them either!  Seriously, I&#39;m just not that desperate for friendship, and if it&#39;s too stressful, then I would much rather be alone with my girls having a peaceful, joyful time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1586314676">Schuyler had a great response to this... I&#39;m quoting it verbatim below:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;ve gotten in social hot water for being to forthright about my feelings<br/>
about parenting and food, largely. The potential cost for my social faux pas<br/>
was to Linnaea and to Simon and not to me. Because of that I&#39;ve worked<br/>
really hard to change my perspective and thus my approach. One is to<br/>
recognize that I&#39;m not all that concerned about the parenting, more about<br/>
the child. That means I can be generous to the child without worrying about<br/>
what their parent is doing, or at least not so much. It may not seem to make<br/>
a lot of difference, but it kind of cuts them out of the picture. It allows<br/>
me to worry less about the parenting and just be the adult I want to be when<br/>
interacting with the child or children. The other thing that helps is to<br/>
recognize how lucky I am that I get to do this life. I know that it&#39;s not<br/>
just luck, it&#39;s a lot of work and thought and reading and breathing and<br/>
patience and curiousity and exploration. But I have a life where I can be<br/>
home<br/>
or out and about with Simon and Linnaea in ways that so many other people I<br/>
know just don&#39;t seem to be able to manage. And while I am sure if this life<br/>
was something they really wanted they could achieve it, it is still because<br/>
of all the wonderful gifts in my life that I am able to do this. It helps a<br/>
lot to see my life as this wonderful joyous trip that I&#39;m on. Sometimes I<br/>
screw up, some moments I suck and grouch and say the wrong thing at the<br/>
wrong time. Who am I to throw stones at glass houses? I get to live with my<br/>
choices and so do other parents.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I try and limit my expression of opinion to appropriate forums. Here is<br/>
great. Here I&#39;m asked what I think and for help and advice. In other<br/>
people&#39;s homes and lives and company I don&#39;t have to be on call as an<br/>
advisor. And when I&#39;m asked for advice, I need to take it with a grain of<br/>
salt, and be prepared not to have anything that I say be taken more as a<br/>
momentary conversation.&quot;    ---Schuyler<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1930565605">man laura  -- to his room by 5 pm? that&#39;s tough and heart breaking.  I appreciate everyone&#39;s feed back on this just to hear i&#39;m not crazy... by no means am I always doing my best but I am aware of what I can do and when something happens I really think on it and do better next time... I think that the one friend I was thinking about when I was writing this is wanting to do the &quot;right thing&quot; with her children however I question the her friends techniques that she is following.  I think she would have  much more success with peaceful techniques -- her children -boys are really gentle little souls so I think that they would respond well.  Her oldest 3 1/2 year old is &quot;whinier&quot; and crys easily but I think he just needs her to listen (which I&#39;ve been there!!!!)   I do enjoy her company and I think some of her comments to me have really been questioning herself also.  thank you<br/>

            Schuyler had a great response to this... I&#39;m quoting it verbatim below:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;ve gotten in social hot water for being to forthright about my feelings<br/>
<br/>
about parenting and food, largely. The potential cost for my social faux pas<br/>
<br/>
was to Linnaea and to Simon and not to me. Because of that I&#39;ve worked<br/>
<br/>
really hard to change my perspective and thus my approach. One is to<br/>
<br/>
recognize that I&#39;m not all that concerned about the parenting, more about<br/>
<br/>
the child. That means I can be generous to the child without worrying about<br/>
<br/>
what their parent is doing, or at least not so much. It may not seem to make<br/>
<br/>
a lot of difference, but it kind of cuts them out of the picture. It allows<br/>
<br/>
me to worry less about the parenting and just be the adult I want to be when<br/>
<br/>
interacting with the child or children. The other thing that helps is to<br/>
<br/>
recognize how lucky I am that I get to do this life. I know that it&#39;s not<br/>
<br/>
just luck, it&#39;s a lot of work and thought and reading and breathing and<br/>
<br/>
patience and curiousity and exploration. But I have a life where I can be<br/>
<br/>
home<br/>
<br/>
or out and about with Simon and Linnaea in ways that so many other people I<br/>
<br/>
know just don&#39;t seem to be able to manage. And while I am sure if this life<br/>
<br/>
was something they really wanted they could achieve it, it is still because<br/>
<br/>
of all the wonderful gifts in my life that I am able to do this. It helps a<br/>
<br/>
lot to see my life as this wonderful joyous trip that I&#39;m on. Sometimes I<br/>
<br/>
screw up, some moments I suck and grouch and say the wrong thing at the<br/>
<br/>
wrong time. Who am I to throw stones at glass houses? I get to live with my<br/>
<br/>
choices and so do other parents.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I try and limit my expression of opinion to appropriate forums. Here is<br/>
<br/>
great. Here I&#39;m asked what I think and for help and advice. In other<br/>
<br/>
people&#39;s homes and lives and company I don&#39;t have to be on call as an<br/>
<br/>
advisor. And when I&#39;m asked for advice, I need to take it with a grain of<br/>
<br/>
salt, and be prepared not to have anything that I say be taken more as a<br/>
<br/>
momentary conversation. &quot;    ---Schuyler<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2057314324">I know the comments from other parents are hard to take! I&#39;m having issues<br/>
with one of my very best friends right now. She keeps making surly comments<br/>
to me like how I&#39;m giving in to the tantrums just because I don&#39;t want to<br/>
hear it anymore and that&#39;s not the right message to send (to the child)<br/>
because he just gets what he wants all the time.<br/>
 <br/>
Well, she did it again yesterday! My son came to me and asked for sorbet<br/>
(while playing at a pizza & play arena with large play structures and slides<br/>
and bouncers) and I was kind of in the middle of some work I had brought<br/>
there to do while he played and (selfishly) asked if he needed it right now<br/>
or if he could drink some lemonade and wait a few minutes (for me to finish<br/>
a task on my computer). Well he started to cry and mumble something about<br/>
how he was SOOOO hungry he had to have it right away, but it was sort of<br/>
nonsensical gibberish (only a mother can understand) as he fell onto the<br/>
floor and rolled around. I&#39;m sure we had been there too long and he&#39;d been<br/>
playing so hard, he just needed a break, so I picked him up and tried to<br/>
calm him down in my lap. I said it sounds like he can&#39;t wait so we&#39;d better<br/>
go get the sorbet now! So that&#39;s when my friend says I&#39;m just giving in to<br/>
the tantrum, and it worked because he gets what he wants. I just don&#39;t see<br/>
it that way! I feel like it&#39;s my job to know when he&#39;s had enough and needs<br/>
a break, and he was right to come to me! I was selfishly wanting to finish<br/>
something first, and when I realized that, it was easy to comfort him and<br/>
wait for him to be calm. Then we got the money out and he got to make the<br/>
purchase (he&#39;s 4, it&#39;s a big deal). Now I could go on about how I don&#39;t like<br/>
to always buy the $1.50 scoop of sorbet because it&#39;s sort of a waste of<br/>
money, but how do you explain that to a 4 yr old? So sometimes we get one! I<br/>
already feel bad that he is allergic to dairy and can&#39;t eat pizza there! We<br/>
have to eat at Wendy&#39;s before we go, although yesterday I ate pizza there,<br/>
so he saw that I had food, so it seemed not the right time to say no to the<br/>
sorbet. ;)<br/>
 <br/>
Oh I&#39;m sure this is way off topic! I guess I just needed to vent. I started<br/>
a thread a while back about this friend in particular and movie choices am<br/>
still processing how I want to deal with her and her surly comments.<br/>
 <br/>
I did like Schuyler&#39;s comments and will be thinking more about how I want to<br/>
deal with children, regardless of what their parents think!!! THAT is<br/>
setting a good example.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1126340347">Kim I haven&#39;t been doing this long, but I do know my child&#39;s needs and when<br/>
she is playing me.  She likes drama sometimes.  While that sounds bad, I<br/>
have to remember that for 9 years, I didn&#39;t always listen to her needs.<br/>
 <br/>
This week my sister critizied me, I told her to go pound sound.  My daughter<br/>
was bullied in various forms for 6 months of school in 2nd grade and on two<br/>
occasions by the teacher in 3rd grade which was last year and I pulled her<br/>
out.  We have quad&#39;s next door 3 of which are girls.  They are my daughter&#39;s<br/>
best friends.  For years she has been afraid to say boo to Ciara because she<br/>
stumps off and won&#39;t play with her.  My daughter told me at 9pm Weds. night<br/>
that she and Ciara had a fight and she didn&#39;t back down and they had started<br/>
shoving.  I asked her who shoved first, she said she didn&#39;t know.  I told<br/>
her Faith, in our family we have a principle that honesty with each other is<br/>
what is most important.  She asked me was I going to be mad and I told her<br/>
no.  She said I pushed Ciara first.  I said that&#39;s fine, I just wanted to<br/>
remember we don&#39;t use hands to solve our differences.  She said okay.<br/>
 <br/>
I personally wanted to shout at the roof&#39;s that my daughter stood up for<br/>
herself, which she has been doing verbally for a bit after discussing many<br/>
times how to handleCiara&#39;s fit&#39;s.  I called my sister and said to her, look<br/>
here was your fear about homeschooling and that we have made tremdous<br/>
progress.  My sister or Negative Nancy went into a whole thing about Faith<br/>
using her hands.  I told her to get off of it.  That she is handling herself<br/>
better, that the kid&#39;s mother and several other people have told me she<br/>
isn&#39;t afraid of her shadow anymore or to speak her mind.  That she can&#39;t<br/>
have it both ways.  Of course I told Faith that she shouldn&#39;t use her hands<br/>
unless someone does that to her.   The boy quad has hit her and she didn&#39;t<br/>
think she was allowed to hit him back.  His mother and I both told her he<br/>
looks at her on the same level as his sister&#39;s and that if he hits her,<br/>
whack the crap out of him.  She said she is afraid to and his sister&#39;s said<br/>
don&#39;t be we will have your back.  <br/>
 <br/>
The quad&#39;s are raised by two working parents, who have sitters in every<br/>
afternoon and my daughter has been raised with them since they were babies.<br/>
We walked the together and they played together from the earliest points in<br/>
their life.  They have undergone a huge upheaval since their mother had to<br/>
go to work and they are acting out more.  I&#39;m not going to stop Faith from<br/>
playing with them. I do point out the differences in how we live our lives.<br/>
Faith doesn&#39;t get hit or smacked.  She had even prior to our change of<br/>
lifestyle maybe 5 time out&#39;s.  All I would say to her is I know you wouldn&#39;t<br/>
be acting this way if you weren&#39;t tired so go take a rest.  She would freak<br/>
out.  I don&#39;t say that anymore.  I call her over and ask if she wants to<br/>
snuggle with me.<br/>
 <br/>
Faith and I have discussed another of the treatment of another child she<br/>
plays with by her mother and father and after the last joint outing.  Faith<br/>
made the decision she can&#39;t watch it anymore that it is to sad how angry and<br/>
bitter the mother is.  How she takes it out on her child and that she has<br/>
done the same to Faith.  Faith doesn&#39;t feel comfortable being around them so<br/>
we had to end the friendship.  This is something Faith did on her own.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1310558024">What always amazes me is when parents aren&#39;t willing to be better parents.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I get that folks generally (with exceptions) are doing the best they can do at the time. At least the best they think they can do at the time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s when they think that they can&#39;t do/be better---that &quot;good enough&quot; is good enough---that&#39;s what blows my mind.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How can someone be a &quot;good enough&quot; parent? Why would that be a goal?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I *know* *I* can be better.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are things that I do &quot;well enough&quot;---and I&#39;m OK with them. Auto repair. I&#39;m willing to pay someone for that! &lt;g&gt; I really don&#39;t want to be more knowledgeable about my minivan. It&#39;s OK. Really. Golf. It&#39;s OK. Really! Plumbing. Mountain climbing. I don&#39;t feel that I need to be better at any of those things. Really. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I *like* being a better gardener, a better dog show judge, a better cook. Because I want to be better at these things, I work at them. If I didn&#39;t care about getting better, I&#39;d be happy with &quot;good enough.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Being a parent and a spouse are, *I* think, the two most important roles I&#39;ll have. I can never be &quot;good enough.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard for me to understand how a mother can be happy being a &quot;good enough&quot; mother. But, ya&#39; know, for some women, it&#39;s OK. Really. And I can&#39;t change that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But I can choose not to let their lack of interest in being better moms affect *me* or my parenting. I can choose to avoid them (which is my usual MO). If I&#39;m around them, <br/>
I can be a shining example with my own boys---and then leave asap. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The hardest situation for me is when I&#39;m friends with the other mom. If you&#39;re anonymous (like here), I&#39;m comfortable giving advice/direction/opinion. If I know you personally, I struggle horribly. I bite my tongue until I eventually explode. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Are *YOU* comfortable with your choice to be a better parent? You don&#39;t have to &quot;go with the crowd.&quot; You *can* stand up for your principles without interfering with their lack of principles. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s important to ask *why*. A lot. It gets easier the more you do it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My parenting doesn&#39;t get attacked any more; but when it did, I learned to turn it around on them: <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We choose not to punish the boys. It doesn&#39;t work, and our relationship with our children is more important to us. Talking with them and modeling seems to work better for us. Please pass the bean dip.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m not going to punish *my* child so that you feel better about punishing yours. Please pass the bean dip.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If I thought you were right, I&#39;d probably do the same thing. Please pass the bean dip.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yeah? Proof is in the pudding, and I&#39;m a patient cook. Let me know how your relationship with your teen is. Please pass the bean dip.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think that the best way to &quot;suggest alternative parenting ideas&quot; is to &quot;Just Do IT! BE the example. Because your children are very young, you&#39;ll probably be laughed at behind your back <br/>
(and to your face) for years. But when you have gentle, kind, interesting *teens* who love to be around you and are honest and generous, you can just sit back and smile when they start whining about how difficult and impossible their teens are. &lt;G&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The view is nice up here. &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>

Hello unschoolers out there. I haven&#39;t posted lately or often but I<br/>
like to pop on and read postings.  I have some thoughts on my mind and<br/>
I feel that this group could help me.  First , I&#39;m mommy to to boys 6<br/>
year old Ian and 21/2 year old garret. I have been implementing<br/>
unschooling for at least 3 years now when my friend directed me to<br/>
this exact group for help with &quot;disciplining&quot; my oldest .  Wow was my<br/>
eyes opened. I stayed up lately reading post having major ah-hah<br/>
moments and fully understanding that why and how unschooling could<br/>
work.. I have slowly let go of some old baggage and implementing<br/>
saying yes more and my relationship with my children has change<br/>
tremendoulsy.  And usually when there is issues -- deep down there<br/>
mine... So here&#39;s my thoughts..<br/>
<br/>
How do I &quot;hold&quot; my own when there others around that implement what I<br/>
consider old parenting styles?  I would like to think that I am a<br/>
strong enough person to not be swayed but I find myself being a little<br/>
stricter when others are around if I don&#39;t watch myself.<br/>
<br/>
I also find myself just feeling=2<br/>
0more stressed.  Not at my kids but the<br/>
other parents.  Sometimes they will make comments , not really<br/>
directly &#39;attacking&#39; my style of parenting but I can sometimes feel<br/>
it.. or is that just me?? and my insecurities??<br/>
<br/>
I have found myself just irritated as shit when parents scold there<br/>
kids over things I really don&#39;t know why they are getting after them.<br/>
 For example, a friend and I are walking around our neighborhood and<br/>
our two boys are at the end of some ones driveway (to wait for us and<br/>
stay out of cars way) and they are just throwing stones up in the air.<br/>
 No biggy in my eyes.  they are not throwing them at anyone , but my<br/>
friend says don&#39;t so then I do. in my thoughts just out of respect but<br/>
then part of me is why???:? <br/>
<br/>
Oh and the other day a new friend is over with her 31/2 and 11/2 year<br/>
old boys and her solution to her boys whining/crying/not sharing is to<br/>
put in the corner (now I think she arrived at this conclusion because<br/>
her friend implements this technique and she feels that her friends<br/>
kids are great their 6, 4 and 15 months =-== well i just met her kids<br/>
yesterday and they just plan seem unhappy. they barely talk (not shy<br/>
because the girl kept coming to me and climbing up on my lap and<br/>
gravitating toward me all night), they are not at all &#39;rowdy&#39; which I<br/>
guess maybe my boys are just overly...  and I just sense a feeling of<br/>
sadness in them.  The mom even joked about that maybe she&#39;s just more<br/>
strict because when we  were<br/>
 talking about timing out and only going<br/>
by the minutes by the age of the child -- and she said she just makes<br/>
them stand there until she feels like letting them out of the time<br/>
out???)   Soooo am I just being overly judgemental... by all means I<br/>
am not a perfect parent , I&#39;m still controlling at  times, and yell<br/>
and have even hit my children (lots better though about controlling<br/>
that issue...) <br/>
<br/>
okay and since I&#39;m on a roll , let me vent about the time my cousin<br/>
was down here and right away -- I recieved comments about that there<br/>
should be routines and bedtimes and controls etc --- which truthfully<br/>
she may have all that implemented but I think some of the shit was a<br/>
front... basically on me about control and then one time I did over<br/>
exert myself with my boy -- she attacked that -- I shouldn&#39;t have done<br/>
that and if cps had seen that I would be in trouble.......and that I<br/>
shouldn&#39;t yell so much... Granted I shouldn&#39;t and since then even<br/>
though she pissed me off I haven&#39;t --- however I do know when i&#39;m<br/>
stressed I&#39;m harder on the boys (not an excuse just acknowledging and<br/>
willing to change).....However, I couldn&#39;t see where her harsh<br/>
controls were great -- yep she had a trained daughter but..<br/>
<br/>
Anyway I guess my ramblings are that I want to be accepted for my<br/>
choices as a parent and I want to except others also...Should I gently<br/>
suggested alternative ways to discipling? or just keep my mouth<br/>
shut???  I like advocating a more positive, peaceful way of parenting<br/>
<br/>
however not everyone gets it?  So many just argue that we need to<br/>
control this or that etc??? so I usually just shut up?  Figure if I<br/>
just show them by actions maybe they will get it... when I have seen a<br/>
better way of handling a situation I see it and try it soo????<br/>
<br/>
anyway if I am making any sense at all please respond.  Its getting<br/>
where I don&#39;t want to even be around some parents.<br/>
<br/>

I know the comments from other parents are hard to take! I&#39;m having issues<br/>
with one of my very best friends right now. She keeps making surly comments<br/>
to me like how I&#39;m giving in to the tantrums just because I don&#39;t want to<br/>
hear it anymore and that&#39;s not the right message to send (to the child)<br/>
because he just gets what he wants all the time.<br/>

NOBODY gets what he wants all the time. But I think I should make every effort to help my child get what he does want as much as possible. He&#39;ll have plenty of real-world disappointment in his life. I want to be the one he comes to for HELP in reaching his goals.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Does it matter what she thinks? Isn&#39;t it more important what your *child* thinks of you?<br/>

Such a great point.   My spouse recently fell back into &#39;I don&#39;t see the learning happening, therefore, do two hours of seatwork every night to prove it&#39; idea.  Needless to say, I stood my ground against THAT idea.  Anyhow, direct arguing doesn&#39;t work so I found a recent article in the Ode magazine written by John Holt and had the ten yo read it out loud to dad.  Problem solved and dad went off to have fun with his son playing with Fruitricity.<br/>

<br/>
We just got to play with this concept, too.  Saturday we went to a birthday party.  The birthday boy was being a rotten kid.  My son told him to stop and the birthday boy chose not to.  My son asked to leave.  I said that was fine and went to leave.  The adults all gave me grief that I should &quot;make&quot; my son stay as it was &quot;good&quot; for him.  I told them that they could do as they please and I would do the same.  Have a nice day.  My son and I left before the food was served.  My son thanked me and told me I was the best mom ever. =)<br/>
He and I went off and had a wonderful evening together.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1704624460">----I think it&#39;s important to ask *why*. A lot. It gets easier the more you<br/>
do it.----<br/>
<br/>
This would gently knock the socks off people when, as the examples are<br/>
phrased, one changes the subject (pass the bean dip or what about that I-95<br/>
construction in [whatever region]) and then perhaps leaves off eye contact<br/>
as well and/or smiles sweetly with it.<br/>
<br/>
But of course if you don&#39;t *want* more conversation (or verbal challenge or<br/>
whatever), don&#39;t ask why.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Kelly&#39;s verrrry confident and she might not mind the added commentary after<br/>
asking why.  So figure that in.  Kelly also has an incredible smile.<br/>
Confident.  It&#39;s unsettling to many who try messing with her.  I feel after<br/>
being around her (only twice) that I could be much more confident after<br/>
being asked why or smiled at as though wondering &quot;what the heck for?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Even though there&#39;s a lot of talk about not seeking to *live* (unless you<br/>
just happen to be lucky in location) with unschoolers or an unschoolish<br/>
tribe, there&#39;s growth potential in meeting confident radical unschoolers in<br/>
real life.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Its helpful to step away from statements like this, even about other <br/>
people&#39;s kids. Its helpful, becasue saying a child is &quot;being rotten&quot; <br/>
is purely a statement about behavior and your reaction to it - <br/>
better to own your reaction and define the behavior more <br/>
specifically. Better still to see a child struggling in a <br/>
complicated social situation without enough support. Its better bc <br/>
to get closer to unschooling its important to look beyond behavior <br/>
to the reasons behind behavior - it promotes understanding and <br/>
compassion and better communication all &#39;round. <br/>
<br/>
That being said, Sunday I left a friend&#39;s house when her step-dd <br/>
showed up, because Mo and the other girl have a *really* rough time <br/>
getting along - so I might have done the same thing at the bday <br/>
party! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-16072786">Your farm looks fabulous, I&#39;m seething with envy.  I&#39;m a born-and-raised city girl who longs for the country but whose husband&#39;s job keeps us all pretty well fed in the city for now.  I have pictures of acreages and country homes plastered all over my dream board.  I love all the farm smells too :).<br/>

Someday...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-946821674">We&#39;re in Corvallis, just south of Portland, OR. We&#39;ll definitely see you at<br/>
Life is Good, it&#39;s our *hometown* conference :D<br/>
A *non-con* is a non-conference gathering of unschoolers; for a weekend, for<br/>
a long weekend, for a week or two ;) It started when I first came to<br/>
Corvallis to visit the Golds and the trip morphed into a big gathering<br/>
(helped us make the decision to move so far from South Dakota!).  I<br/>
recommend them highly, as a way to get to know your unschooling neighbors &<br/>
as a great excuse to party and play together. It&#39;s not just neighbors,<br/>
though, Marty Dodd came from Albuquerque to the first one and the Traaseths<br/>
were here last year from Minnesota :)<br/>
<br/>
Calgary in September... I&#39;m thinking my Super Cool boyfriend might *really*<br/>
like that trip! I&#39;ll throw out the idea and see what happens :)<br/>

I&#39;d love to make it to you Non Con...but it&#39;ll have to wait until next time.  We&#39;re moving this month, so all is a little chaotic and preoccupied with that.  The girls keep asking if we&#39;re bringing their stuff with us to the new house.<br/>
