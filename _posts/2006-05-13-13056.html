<div id="ygrps-yiv-1035006148">Okay, I just posted a little while ago a link to a local news story on <br/>
unschooling, now they have a page where you can send your comments in <br/>
about unschooling.  Here&#39;s the link:  <br/>

These reporters are so uninformed.  Here&#39;s how they worded the topic for <br/>
you to rant on:<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve probably heard of home schooling, where parents teach their kids <br/>
at home using prepared materials and curriculum guides you can buy in <br/>
stores. But some parents are trying something called, &quot;unschooling.&quot; <br/>
That&#39;s teaching kids at home without any time or curriculum structure. <br/>
Kids learn what they want to learn when they want to to learn it. Should <br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; be legal? What obligations should parents have to meet? <br/>
Does it even sound like something that could work? Should kids be able <br/>
to decide what they study?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hello???!!  What did kids do BEFORE there was an organized school system <br/>
in this country???  Seems like the world came pretty far without <br/>
organized school systems.<br/>
