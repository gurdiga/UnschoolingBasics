<div id="ygrps-yiv-11533622">I had posted in my intro about my daughter with autism, and how we have a fairly consistent <br/>
schedule because of her needs, as well as some set table time because the way her brain <br/>
works she does need to have certain things done for her so she can understand.<br/>
<br/>
but then I started to think about all the other things that we do, that really make our home a <br/>
natural learning environment. Because of her deficits, she does not necessarily learn by <br/>
watching, like many kids do, through example. Most of our education is real world though, <br/>
and her math is going to the store and buying things, learning how to order at fast food <br/>
restaurants, how to pay, get change, etc. <br/>
<br/>
In that way parents are facilitators, what are some other ways that parents on this board <br/>
facilitate education? I just wonder if parents here ever contrive a learning situation. This past <br/>
week, the kids are interested in chemistry, so I made  sure that in our baking we talked about <br/>
chemical reactions, changed the recipes some to see how more baking soda affected the <br/>
dough, etc. When we were boiling water we started with ice cubes and talked about changing <br/>
energy to move through states of matter (josh&#39;s interests right now is chemistry and narnia)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I must go, there&#39;s a brawl afoot. Thanks in advance for whatever replies I get. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1182588485">We don&#39;t contrive learning situations because life is full of them <br/>
already. If DS -wants- to learn about the properties of baking soda, <br/>
we get out the baking soda and go to town with it (volcanoes are <br/>
always fun!). We do talk about things as he asks or when something is <br/>
interesting *to us*. I&#39;ll mention over dinner something I found out <br/>
that was of interest. It may be one sentence and away it goes, it may <br/>
end up being a 20 minute discussion, it may end up leading to <br/>
excursions, websites, and other things down the road, or it may simply <br/>
remain one sentence. If we&#39;re baking I might mention that I need to <br/>
measure the baking soda or baking powder carefully (as opposed to <br/>
splashing in the vanilla) and why. In a world brimming over with <br/>
things to explore, we&#39;ve yet to find a need to contrive anything that <br/>
didn&#39;t come up somehow on it&#39;s own.<br/>
<br/>
Seems to me (just the way I&#39;m &#39;hearing&#39; it) that needing to contrive <br/>
learning situations has at back of it an expectation of what kids <br/>
are &#39;supposed to&#39; know, do, be taught. If they&#39;re interested in <br/>
chemistry, get out the household non-toxics and a book of kitchen <br/>
table science and set to it - no need to contrive it, they&#39;re already <br/>
asking for it. If they&#39;re not asking for it, then contriving it will <br/>
simply go in one ear and out the other because it has no place to <br/>
latch on to.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-234042150">Perhaps so. But if you bring up a topic they&#39;ve not yet expressed interest in, and then <br/>
they&#39;re interested, then that&#39;s your &#39;sentence at the table&#39;. Josh never thought that there <br/>
was a math higher than what he already learned. So when I bring up &quot;the next step&quot;, that&#39;s <br/>
fairly contrived. Maybe it&#39;s a matter of perception. <br/>
<br/>
I guess still that brick and morter instilled subconscious thought that kids won&#39;t think of it <br/>
(the next step) on their own.  I was having trouble discerning where the kids own <br/>
curiousity blends in with a parent introducing a new topic. I thought Josh would be <br/>
interested in chemistry, so I pulled up a website and asked what he thought of it. Is that <br/>
considered contrived?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for the feedback,<br/>

   <br/>
  Jaiden Jason and I have been talking about this a bunch more and Jaiden has been wondering were religion and spirituality meet.<br/>
   <br/>
  His examples/questions: If a bunch of other people like your sandwich and want it the same way does spirituality become religion? <br/>
   <br/>
  If your sandwich has been selling and then nobody wants to buy it anymore does religion become spiritualiy or does it just go bad and yucky?<br/>
   <br/>
  If you&#39;ve made a sandwich that you think you&#39;d like but hten you taste it and you don&#39;t can you just throw it away and make a new one?<br/>
   <br/>
  What happens if you never make up your mind and get to eat your sandwich.<br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;m loving the way his mind works!<br/>
   <br/>
  The disscussions lately have had me hungy for sandwiches.<br/>
