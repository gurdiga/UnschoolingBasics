<div id="ygrps-yiv-2443480">I started a political thread at unschooling.info called &quot;Unschoolers Reclaiming our Country&quot;...how we feel and what we can do...<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Please join me there if you feel saddened and frustrated by the election and fearful for the state of our country...<br/>
<br/>
Be Well ~<br/>
