<div id="ygrps-yiv-2019612835">I have a niece who has been labelled learning disability by the powers that <br/>
be in her schooled life. Her parents are ashamed of that. They are ashamed <br/>
that she isn&#39;t as bright as her brother, who has been labelled gifted by the <br/>
powers that be. Their shame means that they don&#39;t notice that she is able to <br/>
remember the names of all the dogs that live in her village, who their <br/>
owners are, what their personalities are like and where they live. They <br/>
aren&#39;t able to see that she can tell you how to get from A to B better than <br/>
an adult is able to and once she&#39;s been and come back, she owns that route. <br/>
They aren&#39;t able to look beyond what someone else said she lacks to who she <br/>
really is.<br/>
<br/>
Their son, who can be sweet and funny, is abusive to his sister in so many <br/>
ways. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen him be generous with her. He is lavished <br/>
with all of the educational opportunities that money can buy while his <br/>
sister was pulled from a decent private school to go to a state school <br/>
(public in the U.S.) as the money was wasted on her. She was bullied so <br/>
badly she is now at home being homeschooled while her mom counts down the <br/>
days tell she reaches the age of maturity.<br/>
<br/>
I can solidly say that those things would be less bad if someone hadn&#39;t come <br/>
along and labelled one child LD and one child gifted. I can say that if each <br/>
of their gifts, the son&#39;s humor and affability and joy of all things Lord of <br/>
the Rings,, and the daughter&#39;s love of animals and amazing mental mapping <br/>
ability, among other things, had been honored and respected than they would <br/>
be less likely to be living in such a divisive household filled with misery <br/>
and impatient waiting for adulthood to arrive.<br/>

&gt;I would agree that labeling is stupid as a rule.<br/>
&gt; But I was under the impression that gifted was<br/>
&gt; used for when a child did things way beyond<br/>
&gt; the norm, like play a concerto on a piano at four.<br/>
&gt; And LD was when they didn&#39;t reach milestones<br/>
&gt; even on a slow level.  (Signs to have them tested<br/>
&gt; for hearing loss, poor eyesight, etc...)<br/>

&gt; &quot;ALL children are gifted. There is no &quot;gifted range.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Exactly.<br/>
&gt; The &quot;gifted&quot; label is just as harmful as the &quot;LD&quot; label. It doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; help you celebrate everything the child is today, and it doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; make for a whole-life outlook on learning.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Jalen couldn&#39;t talk until he was 3 years old, but at 5 years he can<br/>
&gt; beat Halo2, a fairly complicated video game. I prefer to see him as<br/>
&gt; Jalen. Not &quot;behind&quot; or &quot;ahead&quot; or anything but the child he is<br/>
&gt; today. Same for all my children.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I celebrate all of their learning, with no greater focus on any one<br/>
&gt; kind of learning. Knowing your A,B,C&#39;s is no better accomplishment<br/>
&gt; than learning how to fold a paper airplane. If it&#39;s important to the<br/>
&gt; learner, then it&#39;s important.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Jalen doesn&#39;t know his A,B,C&#39;s or how to read anything yet, but he<br/>
&gt; just came to me and asked me what to feed the rats &quot;because they<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t have any food&quot; and informed me he just filled their water<br/>
&gt; bottle. He also informed me that he almost cut his foot by dropping<br/>
&gt; a knife today while putting away dishes. When asked about putting<br/>
&gt; dishes away he said &quot;because I felt like it&quot;.:)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This child has never been asked to put dishes away OR feed the rats.<br/>
&gt; But he wanted to do it spontaneously today. His learning is at his<br/>
&gt; own pace, in his own way and whether he reads at 5 or 15 doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; earn him a label of &quot;gifted&quot; or &quot;learning disabled&quot;.<br/>
