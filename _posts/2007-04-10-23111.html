<div id="ygrps-yiv-1377652813">Hi<br/>
We&#39;re new to unschooling and I&#39;m still trying to convince my dh that RU <br/>
is the way to go. It&#39;s so different from conventional parenting that <br/>
I&#39;m finding it hard to explain and harder to convince him that this is <br/>
the best way to deal with ds. Currently my ds (11) has decided not to <br/>
wash, cut or brush his hair and it is getting long and greasy. Tonight <br/>
my dh told my ds to wash his hair while he was having his bath. Ds <br/>
didn&#39;t do it and dh got mad and a power struggle was created with dh <br/>
feeling not listened to, ds feeling angry and me stuck in the middle. <br/>
When I ask why ds doesn&#39;t wash his hair, he says that the soap gets in <br/>
his eyes, the hair just gets dirty again anyway... We&#39;ve tried in the <br/>
past things to keep the soap out of his eyes, but I think he&#39;s just not <br/>
interested. I would like to keep this a non-issue and let my son decide <br/>
on his own, but my dh doesn&#39;t agree.<br/>
How would you deal with this situation?<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Arlene</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-919571775">One thing I noted is that you asked DS about it - why he didn&#39;t want <br/>
to wash his hair etc. - but you didn&#39;t ask DH about why he feels it <br/>
is so important. This is a biggie that I have to always remind <br/>
myself about: treat my spouse as respectfully as I treat my child. <br/>
Sometimes we get into the habit of &quot;assuming&quot; that since partner is <br/>
an adult, we don&#39;t have to discuss things the same way as we do with <br/>
the kid(s). That has ended up with my DH feeling unlistened to, less <br/>
respected, feelings hurt, etc. So, take a quiet time, perhaps away <br/>
from your DS, and ask your DH why hair length, hair washing, etc is <br/>
really important to him, what in particular (the washing, the <br/>
length, other?) is the bigger problem in his eyes. It might simply <br/>
be that he wants an acknowledgement of his opinion and that&#39;s it <br/>
(since you note he felt unheard). Maybe he&#39;s got it indoctrinated <br/>
into his head since childhood that &quot;only hippy drop out druggies <br/>
have long greasy hair&quot;. So, it&#39;s not so much -your individual child- <br/>
that is at issue as it is the idea of long greasy hair = &quot;loser&quot; or <br/>
bad parenting or something. Once your DH is feeling heard and you <br/>
are talking calmly, maybe bring in DS for a brainstorming session. <br/>
DS wants X, DH would prefer Y, what kind of middle ground can you <br/>
find? For instance, maybe a dry wash thing (spritz it in, comb or <br/>
brush and done) would be minimally invasive for DS and remove enough <br/>
of the greasiness for DH. Or, perhaps, DH wouldn&#39;t mind the not <br/>
washing as much if the hair was a little shorter, if that&#39;s okay to <br/>
DS. And so on - remember, brainstorming is throw out all possible <br/>
ideas, eliminate/censor none of them to start with. So ideas like <br/>
shave his head, grow dreadlocks, wear a helmet, go to a professional <br/>
hair washer once a week, etc are all valid in brainstorming. I know <br/>
my DS (he&#39;s almost 9) doesn&#39;t like washing his hair much. However, <br/>
he does sometimes get an itchy scalp so, with his permission, I&#39;ll <br/>
run a damp washcloth over his scalp while he bathes. After all, the <br/>
scalp is the major thing - hair doesn&#39;t produce oil, the oil glands <br/>
in the scalp do. You might find that your DS would prefer to go to a <br/>
hair salon place and have someone else do it for him (just because <br/>
he&#39;s 11 doesn&#39;t mean he *has to* do it for himself even though he <br/>
can). I know that for a while around that age, I preferred to have <br/>
my mom wash my long hair at the sink with the sink sprayer rather <br/>
than having bath water poured repeatedly over my head. All 3 of us <br/>
(DH, me, DS) pretty much just let our hair grow 11 months of the <br/>
year, then get a shorter cut for the summer around May/June and let <br/>
it grow again (though, since we&#39;re travelling to the Caribbean in <br/>
the fall this year, we&#39;ll probably do another short cut late in the <br/>
summer, it&#39;ll still be pretty hot down there). DH gets particularly <br/>
shaggy - hair below collar length and beard down to midchest - <br/>
before he trims and clips for the summer. And, since he is the at <br/>
home parent, he does sometimes go several days without showering or <br/>
washing his hair (and he&#39;s an adult). I still remember when I was a <br/>
kid and we had a &quot;bath night&quot; once a week - none of this every <br/>
single day showering and hair washing. That lasted until puberty <br/>
pretty much, at which point we *wanted* to shower and feel and smell <br/>
clean. Also, your DS might be at cross purposes with himself - <br/>
longer hair is more likely to look and feel dirty and when washed <br/>
get soap closer around the face. I know that my DS is often more <br/>
comfortable with shorter hair (clippers set at 3 on the side and 5 <br/>
on top for a mild buzz cut) that can just be washcloth washed <br/>
quickly. Keep in mind, too, that your DS&#39; opinion on the subject may <br/>
change as the weather gets warmer and warmer - he may choose to trim <br/>
his hair a little at least and I know from experience (I&#39;ve had hair <br/>
ranging from shorter than collar to down to my belt) that clean, <br/>
brushed (at least a little) hair is way easier to pull back into a <br/>
tail when it&#39;s hot out than tangled, greasy hair.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1203263084">Hi, <br/>
We went 99% RU about a year ago (still working on a few points, <br/>
especially with DH). DD, then 13, didn&#39;t want to bathe or wash hair. <br/>
I put deodorant wipes and deodorant in the car which she was <br/>
agreeable to use. She had been washing her hair before, but not <br/>
combing it out, putting it in a ponytail. When she stopped wanting <br/>
to wash her hair, hats were available and she wore them. A couple of <br/>
months ago we went somewhere and she changed her mind about getting <br/>
out of the car because she said she felt like her hair was too oily, <br/>
so we came home. Now she washes it whenever she thinks it needs it. <br/>
Also, she has chosen not to shave her armpits, but does Nair her <br/>
legs.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of months ago I went to &quot;no shampoo&quot; hair washing, using a <br/>
paste of 2 tbsp of baking powder/water on my scalp and rinsing with <br/>
apple cider vinegar/water (yes, the smell washes completely out - <br/>
you just smell like an Easter egg for a minute!). It works just <br/>
great. (No ill effects to the highlights, either.) DD isn&#39;t <br/>
interested in no &#39;poo, but it is an available option for her.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1774641014">Hi Arlene,<br/>
   <br/>
  My son used to scream when we had to wash his hair. He basically had a phobia of water on his face, due to an unfortunate incident whereby he went under the water during one of his swimming lesson because the &#39;replacement&#39; instructor was to busy fiddling with one of the little girl&#39;s arm band that she didn&#39;t realised my son has already bounced off to the other end of the pool. We always wash his hair for him and we do it speedy quick with him screaming all the way but us assuring him with comforting words. We always have him tilt his head backwards so nothing gets on his face. Eventually, just by accident, we found that he was quite happy &#39;floating&#39; in the bath.  (he hates shower but loves the bath) And because he was &#39;floating&#39;, I&#39;ve convinced him to allow me to &#39;wash&#39; his hair quickly. In this instance, I don&#39;t bother shampoo but just quickly run my fingers thru his hair and scalp, as the water is already scented by a large aromatherapy fizzing &#39; bath bomb&#39;. His hair<br/>
 smells heavenly for the next few days. <br/>
   <br/>
  So instead of trying to get son to wash his hair, maybe it might help if you offer to wash his hair for him, speedily and carefully? I think what&#39;s important for him is to find out that washing hair doesn&#39;t need to be scary and painful, which can be as shampoo in the eys do really sting. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-34873226">having nothing to do with the process of working through this of<br/>
course, but just as an fyi, there are ways to wash the hair without<br/>
soap. I believe the most widely known alternative is to rub baking<br/>
soda in the hair and rinse with water/vinegar mix. This helps maintain<br/>
the acid mantle of the scalp better and tends to reduce the oil<br/>
production. Also I read somewhere that rubbing cornmeal thru the hair<br/>
then brushing it out is a type of &quot;dry washing&quot; of the hair. I know<br/>
there are other alternatives to soap if that is the main issue. :)<br/>

She doesn&#39;t want to wear her hair up, so maybe I&#39;ll look into hats.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1153989648">i have dreadlocks and i wash my hair about twice a week.  if i feel like i<br/>
need a shower i can just get them wet now without always feeling like i<br/>
*had* to wash it when it was normal because otherwise it would get tangled.<br/>
i grew up in arizona and took showers twice a day, washing hair and body<br/>
thoroughly both times, throughout my childhood and teenage years, because it<br/>
was just so friggin&#39; hot so i always felt dirty.  i still have that problem<br/>
in the summer but i have gradually tapered off from showering/washing hair<br/>
every day to showering every other day or less and washing my hair twice a<br/>
week or so.  i have noticed since i&#39;ve been doing this that my skin is<br/>
smoother and healthier, any acne i ever had before has disappeared, and my<br/>
hair is smoother, shinier, thicker, and seems to grow faster.  i believe now<br/>
that washing our hair and skin so much is actually causing a lot of the<br/>
problems that i hear people complain about...acne, oily hair, dry skin,<br/>
etc.  dealing with the oil was a struggle for me for a while, for a few<br/>
months, but now it&#39;s balanced out and i never have to deal with that issue<br/>
(and actually with dreads it doesn&#39;t matter anyway).  i never need lotion<br/>
anymore and my husband has found that most of his eczema issues have<br/>
resolved since he eliminated harsh chemicals on his skin and hair (we only<br/>
use bronner&#39;s on our hair and skin).  we also need less deodorant...we<br/>
always have a pleasant smell that people comment on often.  :)  (i think<br/>
that mostly has to do with our diet though.)<br/>
<br/>
we do struggle with the bath issues with our son though.  he just barely<br/>
turned two and he has hair halfway down his back.  i do trim his bangs so<br/>
it&#39;s not hanging in his face, but we&#39;ve decided to let him decide when/if he<br/>
wants to cut the rest, especially since he&#39;s expressed dismay at the sight<br/>
of himself in a ponytail (where&#39;s my hair?).  but it does need to be washed<br/>
because it&#39;s a magnet for anything he eats.  he&#39;ll sometimes let me pull it<br/>
back while he eats but he usually pulls it out and that defeats the purpose<br/>
since he&#39;s putting lots of food in his hair while pulling out the hairtie.<br/>
:)  he loves taking baths and having his face and body cleaned, but DETESTS<br/>
having water put on his head.  i really don&#39;t know how to deal with this<br/>
issue.  i want to leave his hair be but i also have a lot of pressure on me<br/>
to cut his hair from our very conservative families (anywhere from &quot;he&#39;s<br/>
going to be teased for looking like a girl&quot; to &quot;you&#39;re the mom...who cares<br/>
what he wants?&quot; to &quot;you&#39;re going to make him gay!&quot;) and when they see<br/>
pictures of him with peanut-butter head it just reinforces their argument.<br/>
so i don&#39;t know how to deal with this.  if he would even just let me rinse<br/>
his hair i would probably be satisfied with that, but any water goes on his<br/>
head at all and he totally freaks out.  i could use some suggestions too if<br/>
anyone has any, on how to make bathtime easier.<br/>
<br/>
as to your question, i wouldn&#39;t worry about it.  clearly you&#39;re more worried<br/>
about it than he is.  ok, that didn&#39;t sound nice but i didn&#39;t mean it in a<br/>
mean way.  are you afraid it will reflect badly on you if his hair is long,<br/>
greasy, etc.?  maybe you could discuss the issue with him of what sort of<br/>
image we (sadly) project by what we look like and ask if he&#39;s comfortable<br/>
with people&#39;s judgments against him...and you.  if he is, i would just let<br/>
it go.  eventually he&#39;ll probably get sick of it and he&#39;ll remember that you<br/>
supported his choice.  one thing you might suggest is baking soda.  during<br/>
the worst of my oily phases, especially camping, i&#39;d just pat my fingers in<br/>
baking soda, scrunch it up into my roots, then comb it out.  it sucks up the<br/>
oil and takes away any smell that might exist.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1908048535">Hmm - if he&#39;s -not- pulling out the hair tie (and getting everything <br/>
involved in his hair), is it mostly on the ends, since they are more <br/>
likely to dangle forward? He might be okay with laying back and <br/>
floating his hair some in the tub - a few shakes and wiggles (and a <br/>
little support from mom) and most of the worst of it would work <br/>
itself out.<br/>
<br/>
Also, my DS did NOT like even brushing or combing his hair (or <br/>
having it brushed or combed) until I showed him how I could use <br/>
a &quot;trick&quot; I learned when I was a kid and had REALLY long hair (the <br/>
idea of Mommy being little and having really really long hair was <br/>
intriguing - I usually keep mine somewhere between just shy of <br/>
collar and bottom of shoulder blades now). I hold a section up close <br/>
to the scalp and brush from my hand to the end - my hand acts as a <br/>
shock absorber so that there is no pulling against his scalp. As <br/>
long as I go slowly around his head this way, he&#39;s quite willing for <br/>
me to occasionally brush his hair.<br/>
<br/>
Funny hair story: Several years ago, I had let my hair just grow for <br/>
almost 2 years. Then I went and got it cut (and donated it). When I <br/>
came home, with chin length hair, DS (who was about 4 at the time) <br/>
looked me over and said &quot;Now you look like a real Mommy&quot; and went <br/>
back to playing. I pondered for a minute or two and realized that of <br/>
the kids he knew/saw on a regular basis (relatives, friends, etc), <br/>
every single mom had hair that was collar length or shorter.<br/>

&gt; Also, my DS did NOT like even brushing or combing his hair (or<br/>
&gt; having it brushed or combed) until I showed him how I could use<br/>
&gt; a &quot;trick&quot; I learned when I was a kid and had REALLY long hair (the<br/>
&gt; idea of Mommy being little and having really really long hair was<br/>
&gt; intriguing - I usually keep mine somewhere between just shy of<br/>
&gt; collar and bottom of shoulder blades now). I hold a section up close<br/>
&gt; to the scalp and brush from my hand to the end - my hand acts as a<br/>
&gt; shock absorber so that there is no pulling against his scalp. As<br/>
&gt; long as I go slowly around his head this way, he&#39;s quite willing for<br/>
&gt; me to occasionally brush his hair.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Funny hair story: Several years ago, I had let my hair just grow for<br/>
&gt; almost 2 years. Then I went and got it cut (and donated it). When I<br/>
&gt; came home, with chin length hair, DS (who was about 4 at the time)<br/>
&gt; looked me over and said &quot;Now you look like a real Mommy&quot; and went<br/>
&gt; back to playing. I pondered for a minute or two and realized that of<br/>
&gt; the kids he knew/saw on a regular basis (relatives, friends, etc),<br/>
&gt; every single mom had hair that was collar length or shorter.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-133356963">Personally, I rarely use soap on my hair. Rarely, like, once a month. <br/>
It gets rinsed thoroughly in the shower daily. soap is not necessary. <br/>
When it does get washed, I use castile soap, which is oil based so <br/>
doesn&#39;t run anywhere you don&#39;t put it. It does an effective job of <br/>
cleaning while not stripping the hair of its natural oils.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately for me, I don&#39;t have to deal with the alternate parent <br/>
not being convinced of unschooling as I&#39;m a single parent, but if <br/>
your husband&#39;s issue is &quot;not feeling listened to&quot; perhaps he should <br/>
converse more than command. If his command for something as simple <br/>
as &quot;wash your hair&quot; is met with such disagreement not, it does not <br/>
bode well for the next... well, at least 7 years, where there are <br/>
sure to be more important things than greasy hair to argue about.<br/>
<br/>
who is really affected by your son&#39;s choice not to wash his hair? him <br/>
or you?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My 6 year old has screamed and cried every time I was his hair since he <br/>
was old enough to know I was washing his hair. I have no solutions to <br/>
this. He does attempt to wash it himself, and I try to let him but he <br/>
needs help rinsing, so I try to do it as quickly as possible with a <br/>
washcloth over his eyes and a towel handy to wipe his face off. He is <br/>
paranoid about getting water in his ears/eyes/nose. <br/>
<br/>
My 14 year old will wash his own hair in the shower. Getting him to <br/>
take a shower is something else. Not because he doesn&#39;t want to, but <br/>
because he puts it off....for days sometimes. Then he breaks out like <br/>
mad. When he first started puberty around 11, he started getting acne. <br/>
I tried to explain to him that having a clean face and clean hair will <br/>
help to keep his skin clear. He uses acne free on his face - when he <br/>
showers. I used to wash his face and hair for him every morning when he <br/>
was in public school because we were always in such a rush and his hair <br/>
and skin were great. Now, I figure we&#39;re home, he can do it himself, <br/>
but he&#39;s really breaking out bad, even his back. It looks so painful, <br/>
you&#39;d think that would be a motivator to go shower every day! I feel so <br/>
bad for him that I at least put some acne cream on his face and back <br/>
before bed if he hasn&#39;t got his shower. I also let him pick out his own <br/>
body wash, shampoo, men&#39;s cologn and deoderant so he feels more in <br/>
charge of his personal hygene. I also count his personal hygene as a <br/>
non-core subject to help motivate him to do it.<br/>
<br/>
I like the idea of the no-poo. I&#39;ll check it out. I&#39;m not fond of all <br/>
the chemicals we are exposed to. A more natural method sounds great!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-422529789">The no-poo sounds interesting. I may try it, but I&#39;m afraid of the<br/>
possibility of 2 wks with nasty hair. lol!<br/>
<br/>
****<br/>
  yeah, this is the part that stops me from going no-poo -- I can&#39;t stand one day of slightly dirty hair (I swear it feels different on my head on day #2) much less two weeks! <br/>
   <br/>
  What I have done is switch to homemade shampoo.  I spent several weeks creating the right recipe, going from soap flakes (too strong a soapy smell) to using a mix of Dr. Bronner&#39;s almond soap (no sodium laureth sulfate or other foaming agents) mixed with chamomile tea for highlights (2 oz soap to 12 oz tea).  I&#39;m still using a commercial conditioner, since I haven&#39;t found any conditioner/detangle recipes work for me.  I have the kind of hair that tangles sitting still, so de-tangling after washing is a must.<br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;m saving money, and my hair doesn&#39;t get oily as quickly as before -- I can at least make it to mid-morning the next day before it&#39;s too oily to be seen.  With regular shampoo, it&#39;s often feeling/looking too oily for me by dinnertime!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-775510411">We mostly don&#39;t use shampoo on the boys, unless their hair is really<br/>
dirty and can&#39;t get out without a shampoo.  The only we have trouble<br/>
with is Jonathan, since he has shoulder-length hair that is really,<br/>
really fine and tangles easily.  If we go 2-3 without brushing it,<br/>
dreads start to appear in the back.  The solution we found, is to bring<br/>
him in the shower with us, and with a really nice plant shampoo wash<br/>
twice, and rince with the telephone shower head (not sure it&#39;s the<br/>
english name for it!) and rinse without anything getting in his eyes.<br/>
We then use conditionner for at least a minute while he plays with the<br/>
shower head.  After the shower, we comb through and wait for next time.<br/>
We&#39;ve had trouble with my mom who freaks out with his hair, but we&#39;ve<br/>
learned to live with it.  It&#39;s Jonathan and he gets to decide what to do<br/>
with his hair, long or short.  And he is really cute like that ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2032053867">I tried to explain to him that having a clean face and clean hair will<br/>

<br/>
actually, at your son&#39;s age the primary cause of his acne is hormones, not<br/>
uncleanliness.  it&#39;s a myth that being dirty causes acne.  it may exacerbate<br/>
it, but the primary source is hormones.  his best bet for prevention and<br/>
treatment is eating a good diet and NOT using those harsh cleansers and acne<br/>
treatments.  those cleansers, creams, etc., just start a bad cycle of<br/>
stripping the oils from the skin, so the skin revs up its sebum output to<br/>
protect the skin, which exacerbates existing acne, so it *seems* that more<br/>
cleaning is needed, and so it goes.  if he just rinses his face a couple of<br/>
times a day with warm water, keeps his hair out of his face, washes his<br/>
pillowcase often, and avoids harsh cleansers, that&#39;s the best he can do,<br/>
because the primary issue is his hormones and probably secondarily whatever<br/>
he&#39;s using to try to &quot;fix&quot; the problem.  these:  &lt;body wash, shampoo, men&#39;s<br/>
cologn and deoderant&gt; are very likely also a contributing factor.  the more<br/>
products a person is exposed to, the more oil their skin will produce to try<br/>
to flush out the toxins.  maybe try a simple castile soap like bronner&#39;s for<br/>
when he does shower and eliminate everything else.  the rock is a very<br/>
respectable deodorant substitute.  a tiny amount of essential oil can go a<br/>
long way as a &quot;cologne&quot; - OMG, colognes are the devil for boys with acne<br/>
because of the alcohol.  there are many essential oils with masculine<br/>
scents.  he shouldn&#39;t need a body wash.  they are universally drying.  dry<br/>
might seem like what you want since it&#39;s oil that causes acne, but STRIPPING<br/>
oil is only going to increase the output - and body washes, most soaps,<br/>
shampoos, etc. are all intended to strip oils.  what you want is a balance.<br/>
if the acne is painful, you can rub the skin with an infusion of chamomile,<br/>
lavender and aloe with a *tiny* drop of eucalyptus for cooling.  garlic is<br/>
also pretty effective at helping to balance oil production, but lots of<br/>
people are adverse to putting it directly on the skin.  but basically, he&#39;s<br/>
just going to have to grow up so his hormones can equalize.  it probably<br/>
makes him feel bad hearing that its his dirtiness causing it...my parents<br/>
told me the same thing, even though i showered twice a day.  i didn&#39;t have a<br/>
lot of acne, just normal teenager stuff, but i also thought it was because i<br/>
was a dirty person.  it&#39;s horribly esteem-destroying and it does NOT usually<br/>
motivate someone to want to be cleaner.  quite the opposite.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1469343025">Wow - thanks everyone for taking the time to respond to this. You&#39;ve <br/>
given me a lot to think about and look into, not just regarding the <br/>
communication issues, but also the effect of all the chemicals we use <br/>
on our bodies. <br/>
Deb, I think that you have a point that I didn&#39;t consider - letting my <br/>
dh feel heard and respected. My dh works long hours, so he doesn&#39;t get <br/>
the same level of connection with ds as I do, and I think that he <br/>
feels left out a bit because of that. Add to that our conditioning to <br/>
give out commands as parents, rather than discuss things to find a <br/>
mutually agreeable solution - it&#39;s a huge change to get used to!!<br/>
So thank you everyone for your thoughts and ideas!<br/>
