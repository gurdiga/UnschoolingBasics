&quot;...since  we can&#39;t know what knowledge will be most needed in the future, it <br/>
is senseless  to try to teach it in advance. Instead, we should try to turn <br/>
out people who  love learning so much and learn so well that they will be able <br/>
to learn whatever  needs to be learned.&quot;<br/>
