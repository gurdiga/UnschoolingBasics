<div id="ygrps-yiv-454436399">One year ago my son was crying not to go to school.  I was being told <br/>
it is you making this so hard -- even the local vet confirmed (she <br/>
knew cause all three of her boys had similar &quot;issues&quot;) - so because I <br/>
would not rip my hand out of his and turn my back on him he was <br/>
biting his lips til they bled, messing his pants (never a problem <br/>
before), crying and just not there because I held onto him.  I didn&#39;t <br/>
have a son - I had symptoms.  He was fearful - professed how stupid <br/>
he was (he can&#39;t read and for the life of him when he was called in <br/>
class it took minutes before he sorted through &quot;wow, that&#39;s me, ok <br/>
what did she say, and all the other thoughts&quot; and by that time he was <br/>
wrong or stupid, which ever you like.  <br/>
<br/>
Skip forward to yesterday - one year later.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mom&#39;s still mum and she is getting it wrong all the time...  My son <br/>
is seven and was 3 months preemie - he has not spent a night away <br/>
from me until last night - 100 miles away - we have been through it.<br/>
<br/>
For the last few months he has been asking to stay at my dad&#39;s house <br/>
for the weekend.  After all of the good excuses ran out his choice is <br/>
to be there - and he is loving it.  I have been plagued with worry, <br/>
fear and guilt about letting him down there.  Really getting into my <br/>
head about MY history with MY dad and why I shouldn&#39;t trust him.  <br/>
While I was in my shower talking about how I would post this concern <br/>
and what the responses would be and as I am addressing those thoughts <br/>
it happens.... the Epiphany strikes....I saw my son(no like really)(I <br/>
was saying it&#39;s about him but...) and now .... it is about him - he <br/>
is having his life on his terms - this is the time that I would <br/>
be &quot;hurting him&quot; by holding him.  But he is telling me!  Mom &quot;I love <br/>
you&quot; yes I want to be here until tomorrow don&#39;t forget my hug!  and <br/>
he is fine. I have called two times so far today and sent him a <br/>
picture message - and he has my cell phone and my digital camera and <br/>
I am glad to let him borrow them... <br/>
<br/>
How can the &quot;professionals&quot; be so wrong moreover how can billions be <br/>
so blind?  <br/>
<br/>
My son! is strong, independent, a thinker, intelligent, confident.  <br/>
He is NOT a symptom.  <br/>
<br/>
Progress - without a doubt!<br/>
