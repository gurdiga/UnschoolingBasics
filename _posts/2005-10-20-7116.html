<div id="ygrps-yiv-105022964">My 9yr old has made friends with a 6year old girl that lives about 3 <br/>
blocks away from here. Since he doesn&#39;t have any other friends in the <br/>
area its nice he met someone close, BUT I don&#39;t like the father. The <br/>
little girl lives with her father (who apparently is going through a <br/>
divorce with the mother who is on drugs and homeless). The father <br/>
doesn&#39;t work(I was told that his parents pay for the house) and <br/>
appears to just hang out on the computer and play games. He seems to <br/>
me like he has some mental issues (difficulties). I talked to his <br/>
sister one day (who lives across the street from him) because Jio had <br/>
run down there and was playing inside there house (which is not what <br/>
Jio said he was going to do). She told me that I didn&#39;t want my son <br/>
in his house...that it was dirty and that DYFS was over there once a <br/>
week. She said he had some mental slowness of some sort, but that he <br/>
would never hurt Jio or anything like that. He has said things like <br/>
he&#39;s looking for a girlfriend/friends...which I told him I was not <br/>
single. Though he sister commented something like he already thinks <br/>
I&#39;m his girlfriend. I guess becuase when I see him and his daughter <br/>
I&#39;ll wave..or say Hi. The guy makes me uneasy, though he may just be <br/>
a nice guy thats slow. I have an autistic son so I&#39;m sensitive to <br/>
people with mental issues and such. I&#39;ve tried to tell Jio I don&#39;t <br/>
want him in the house because we don&#39;t know him and sometimes people <br/>
can seem nice but do bad things to kids. I&#39;ve said he may be nice but <br/>
I&#39;m not sure and I don&#39;t trust him. But Jio insists on running down <br/>
there and going in their house. I also feel bad to say something like <br/>
I don&#39;t trust you to the father when yesterday he said I trust you to <br/>
me. I&#39;ve told Jio to invite her to our house or he could play outside <br/>
at thier house but that when she went inside he had to come home. <br/>
He&#39;s not very happy with this. And its getting colder and I know its <br/>
going to be harder to play outside for long periods. What would you <br/>
do? Should I just trust him for short periods or insist that he <br/>
cannot go into thier house.<br/>
