<div id="ygrps-yiv-502933491">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
I have been a lurker on this board for some time now and I just had<br/>
to tell you that the post you made about force feeding our children <br/>
literally brought me to tears!  It moved me soooo much! Let me tell <br/>
you a little background.<br/>
I had been a (non-certified) teacher in an elementary parochial <br/>
school off and on for about 15 yrs. My 5th grade ds was having some <br/>
anger management and emotional problems so the school (public)<br/>
recommended I have him evaluated.  The &quot;doctor&quot; said he was <br/>
disturbed and showed signs of trauma and psychosis! He had never <br/>
been traumatised by anything that I could think of! WELL, unless you <br/>
count being accidentally left on the playground at the head-start <br/>
program he attended for preschool or being accidentally locked in <br/>
the bathroom AND left there while everyone else in the class went <br/>
outside -TWICE - once in kindergarten and again in 2nd grade! I was <br/>
floored -my sweet little boy psychotic? NO WAY! So I tried to get <br/>
the schools assistance with this! What a waste of everyone&#39;s time!<br/>
<br/>
 So, after doing some research and deciding that the system was <br/>
failing my son, I decided to homeschool him, surely I could do <br/>
better. I figured with what they were doing to him that even if I <br/>
never taught him a thing he would be better off than he was in their <br/>
not so capable hands!  With my (now admitted) holier than thou <br/>
teaching background I was the last person to think that <br/>
homeschooling was a good idea - I thought only extremist wackos did <br/>
that! ((((BOY I&#39;M GLAD I WAS WRONG AND GLAD TO ONE OF THEM!))))  So, <br/>
I withdrew him from school and loved having him home so much that I <br/>
soon withdrew my 2nd grade dd. I took my now 12 yo ds out of PS a <br/>
little over a year ago, then a few months later my 7 yo dd. I still <br/>
had one dd in HS (10th grade - she did not want to leave her <br/>
friends). So, against MY better judgement, I left her there. Since <br/>
then we have moved to another state and she decided to hs. YAY!!!<br/>
 <br/>
I have looked into unschooling (obviously since I am on this board) <br/>
since the beginning but my husband is TOTALLY not into the whole <br/>
idea of homeschooling much less unschooling. He has NO desire to <br/>
read ANYTHING or at the very least talk about the issue!  I have had <br/>
to fight every step of the way. I even had to take them out of ps <br/>
without his blessing (I don&#39;t ask permission for ANYTHING - lol!). <br/>
Needless to say that was a rough patch to get through - but here we <br/>
are none-the-less! I tried the school at home thing for a while - <br/>
mostly to please dh, but seeing the frustration in all of us <br/>
returning started to back off and just have fun.  &quot;If&quot; learning <br/>
happened great!  We really only did &quot;school&quot; when dh had a day off.<br/>
  Then we found out we had to move and with getting ready for that <br/>
move - shucks - there was just no time for &quot;school&quot;. It has now been <br/>
about 7 months since the move and I just keep putting off school. I <br/>
keep finding excuses not to start. Thinking to myself that we will <br/>
just stay like this and lean more towards unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
BUT,<br/>
 (you knew this was coming didn&#39;t you?) <br/>
lately I have been getting worried about my dd and going to college. <br/>
I talked to her about it today and she says that she wants to go to <br/>
college because &quot;she knows she should&quot;. I told her that she didn&#39;t <br/>
necessarily HAVE to if her interests took her elsewhere (and now I <br/>
feel like I am being selfish and almost trying to talk her out of <br/>
it!). She is very interested in art, especially photography. A local <br/>
photo shop owner has offered to show her how to develop her own B/W <br/>
film and I am going to arrange a volunteer position at our local <br/>
little theater working behind the scenes (she says she is too shy <br/>
for anything to do with acting). When I told her about the <br/>
opportunities she was really enthusiastic and said she wanted to do <br/>
it! I know her attitude towards college comes from my dh. Who by the <br/>
way went to college for four years, has two degrees and a <br/>
certificate, none of which are worth the paper they are printed on <br/>
because he doesn&#39;t use them or the &quot;education&quot; they came with in any <br/>
way and never has (whew!). But anyway, I am just so scared that with <br/>
only 2 years left (technically speaking), if I don&#39;t &quot;school&quot; her <br/>
she won&#39;t be able to get into art school or college at all. <br/>
<br/>
Get ready for this! ------ <br/>
<br/>
I was looking into getting a unit studies curriculum to begin in the <br/>
fall. I am so confused right now from reading so much info that my <br/>
head is spinning. <br/>
<br/>
Then I read your post!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your analogy - I was moved to tears because I<br/>
really do feel exactly that way inside but these superficial fears<br/>
and of course my husband breathing schooling down my neck are about<br/>
to drive me insane!!!  It feels like a huge weight has been lifted <br/>
off my shoulders and boy does it feel liberating!  Now that I&#39;ve <br/>
taken this first step I can&#39;t wait to see what the future holds for <br/>
all of us!  I am most excited for my youngest son who, with the <br/>
grace of god, will never have to do &quot;school&quot;.  Unless of course that <br/>
is what he chooses for himself!<br/>
<br/>
Oh and by the way - my ds is no longer &quot;psychotic&quot;, &quot;angry&quot;<br/>
or &quot;disturbed&quot; in any way!(in my eyes never was) I believe<br/>
wholeheartedly it was the school which made him act like he was - <br/>
they are the ones responsible for inflicting the &quot;trauma&quot;!<br/>
Temporary insanity if you will - brought on by a system which was<br/>
stifling, abusive and oppressive.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, so there you have it. So sorry for such a long post but it has<br/>
been a long time coming! Thanks to all who have listened. Your<br/>
thoughts, feelings, comments, advice and suggestions are highly<br/>
valued and encouraged!!!!<br/>

out on this venture.  My response to him was, &quot;If you aren&#39;t going to<br/>

do.&quot;  I figured if he was not going to be the one who was home with<br/>
them all day, taking care of them all day, being the one that was<br/>
going to have to deal with the state, and do all the toting and<br/>
running and planning *and* if he wasn&#39;t going to take a vested<br/>
interest in how they were educated (by not informing himself) then he<br/>
had NO say in how I went about it.  Since then he has seen the<br/>
positive aspects of unschooling and has taken the time to read about<br/>
unschooing in small doses.  An article here an e-mail there, etc until<br/>
now he is a major unschooling supporter!  He still hasn&#39;t read a book,<br/>
but he has purused Sandra Dodd&#39;s website, articles and e-mails from<br/>
Ren, Rue, Kelly, Pam and Mary (and me) and he has even listened to<br/>
part of a podcast!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Wow. this happened to Roxana (now 18) TWICE, as well. Poor kid,  <br/>
sitting in the toilet stall.  The janitor opens the door, sticks his  <br/>
head in and says, &quot;Anybody here?&quot; in a booming, loud voice. SHE  <br/>
cringes and says nothing - how the heck does SHE know who he is and  <br/>
why this loud strange man is entering the girls bathroom, etc. He  <br/>
turns off the light and locks the door - from the outside. She was  <br/>
trapped in there for 45 minutes the first time - it was in the fall  <br/>
of 1st grade. The teacher finally noticed she was missing and went  <br/>
looking for her. She would NEVER use the bathroom at school, after  <br/>
that, until, believe it or not, at the very end of 1st grade, I was  <br/>
working in the classroom after school, with her teacher, and she got  <br/>
desperate enough to absolutely HAVE to go to the bathroom. But all  <br/>
the building bathrooms were locked up already - so she went to the  <br/>
after-school daycare program and asked to use their bathroom. She  <br/>
went inside the bungalow where the bathroom was and they forgot she  <br/>
was there and they locked up the bungalow and left. When I went  <br/>
looking for her, I could hear her crying, but I couldn&#39;t get in to  <br/>
let her out. They had to call for the janitor to come back to the  <br/>
school to get her out.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have said similar things to my dh and I guess that&#39;s the reason <br/>
for the shutdown on his part.  He pretty much just pretends the <br/>
situation doesn&#39;t exist.  Ok by me, for now anyway!  I have said to <br/>
him &quot;Hey listen to this...&quot; and read him an email, post or article <br/>
on the subject.  He listens and then just quietly walks away.  I <br/>
have stopped pushing mostly because he has stopped griping!  We all <br/>
live in our own little worlds I guess, but whatever works for now is <br/>
fine with me.  Hopefully he will come around.  We have already seen <br/>
so many positive changes in our children, which is probably why he <br/>
has been so quiet.  He doesn&#39;t want to admit that I was right and <br/>
unschooling actually works!  The only time he says anything now is <br/>
when my kids are figuring out some sort of math problem they have <br/>
encountered.  My dh is a math whiz.  He was in Mu Alpha Theta and <br/>
took honors calculus in HS.  He gets very frustrated when he sees <br/>
the kids having trouble with simple math that they were doing with <br/>
no problem while in PS.  Math is a very high priority for him.  I <br/>
was so traumatised by math as a child that I was lucky to pass <br/>
general math classes in hs and even had to take a remedial math <br/>
class in order to go to college.  But other than my needing to use a <br/>
calculator, I think I am doing fine without knowing how to do calc!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One of the reasons I had to take my ds to doctors was because he had <br/>
a wetting problem.  NEVER wet the bed or at home but CONSTANTLY wet <br/>
at school.  I didn&#39;t realize how much of a problem it was for a very <br/>
long time. He would occasionally come home wet but told me it <br/>
happened on the bus.  The only time the school ever called me to <br/>
bring him a change of clothes was on the last day of school (1st <br/>
grade).  That is when I found this out!  I had meetings with <br/>
teachers and found out that he was not using the toilet at all.  He <br/>
would just go in his pants.    Now the first locked bathroom <br/>
incident happened in kindergarten - this had been happening the <br/>
whole time.  He didn&#39;t have a wetting problem at home at that time <br/>
just at school.  However it did evolve into an everyday problem.  <br/>
Doctors told me there was nothing physically wrong with him - it was <br/>
psychological.  My fault - he was looking for attention because <br/>
before the problem started I was always there (room mom) and then I <br/>
had to go back to work.  It&#39;s funny how even  with the knowledge of <br/>
what had happened it was still my fault.  Institutions like to stick <br/>
together!  Thank God I didn&#39;t accept any of this!  If you can <br/>
believe it my ds is 12 now and just recently has stopped wetting.  <br/>
Still has the occasional accident but 99.9% improved.  I am so <br/>
grateful for the opportunity to be able to have my kids at home with <br/>
those who truly love and care for them and have a vested interest in <br/>
their well being!<br/>
