<br/>
    I&#39;d love to hear more about &quot;permissive&quot; vs. &quot;authoritative&quot; <br/>
parenting, and<br/>
how those relate (or don&#39;t) to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you feel those are your only two options?<br/>
<br/>
Partner parenting, respectful parenting, mindful parenting, consensual <br/>
living, solution-oriented parenting---there are so many *better* ways <br/>
to parent.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading lately about how permissive parenting produces a <br/>
confused<br/>
an depressed adult - that children need limits in order to feel safe and<br/>
have purpose.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I suppose, to traditional parents, I may seem like a permissive parent.<br/>
<br/>
A child doesn&#39;t need &quot;limits&quot; to feel safe and have purpose (not sure <br/>
what the &quot;have purpose&quot; part means, exactly). He needs a partner who <br/>
will look out for him and protect him and allow him to make mistakes <br/>
and learn. He needs respect and kindness and generosity and patience.<br/>
<br/>
  He&#39;s a stranger---and alien---in this world, and it is our <br/>
responsibility to help him navigate it. NOT control him.<br/>
<br/>
The world is FULL of natural limits. Our lives are FULL of natural <br/>
limits. It&#39;s the way we deal with those limits that matters. Finding <br/>
solutions and dealing with obstacles and knowing what limits are real.<br/>
<br/>
Too many mainstream parents make up arbitrary limits to &quot;teach&quot; their <br/>
children that limits exist. We simply deal with the ones we already <br/>
have naturally.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
It seems like a lot of people assume that unschooling must be <br/>
permissive,<br/>
but is that true?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think more people assume that you have to &quot;lay down the law&quot; and make <br/>
children be obedient. To respect authority.<br/>
<br/>
We work WITH our children.<br/>
<br/>
And I have a bumper sticker: Question Authority<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I do know that my son would eat trash and dead birds if I let him, so in<br/>
that way I am not permissive.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I sent this to Sandra for her &quot;IfILet&quot; page. I have to admit, this one <br/>
is my favorite!<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/ifilet">http://sandradodd.com/ifilet</a><br/>
<br/>
Does your son LIKE to eat trash and dead birds? Why?<br/>
<br/>
If those things are truly enticing him, I&#39;d say there might be a <br/>
physical problem---like pica. I&#39;d have him checked out.<br/>
<br/>
Children don&#39;t CHOOSE to eat trash and dead birds. Seriously.<br/>

<br/>
Exactly.<br/>
Establishing a &quot;rule&quot; seems to shortcircuit the creative process too.<br/>
If my child really wanted/needed to play loudly when others were<br/>
sleeping, we could brainstorm a number of options, none of which<br/>
include people giving up sleep. I think rules and &quot;no&quot; simply limit<br/>
creative thinking. When we all start problem solving together, it&#39;s<br/>
amazing the options that turn up.<br/>
<br/>
So far, all of my children are really used to the idea of being quiet<br/>
when someone is sleeping. That&#39;s just how we treat each other.<br/>

   I thought I&#39;d send these definitions so you&#39;ll know what I meant by<br/>
authoritative. My understanding is that authoritative parents also show<br/>
unconditional love to their children, and do not use punishments. They <br/>
are<br/>
responsive, but also establish guidelines. I think the authoritative <br/>
parent<br/>
is also respectful, mindful, and solution-oriented.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-==-=-<br/>
<br/>
No, he isn&#39;t. It just seems that way from a traditional, mainstream <br/>
perspective.<br/>

<br/>
So far, so good.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
They offer emotional support, but are also firm in establishing <br/>
guidelines,<br/>
limits and expectations.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
Mindful, unschooling parents offer emotional, financial, physical, <br/>
spiritual,  (and many other kinds of) support and are committed to <br/>
helping their children find their own boundaries and those of others. <br/>
They help their children understand limits---REAL limits as well as <br/>
society&#39;s arbitrary ones.<br/>
<br/>
-==-=-=<br/>
<br/>
 They listen actively to their children and<br/>
encourage them to make their own decisions.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Good.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 When appropriate, they involve<br/>
their children in the process of creating rules and consequences so that<br/>
their children learn to understand and appreciate the rationale for <br/>
rules.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
BIG divergence here!<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t live by rules. We live a principled life instead.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They focus on positive feedback rather than on punishment.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Although punishment *could* enter into he equation if necessary.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Very importantly,<br/>
authoritative parents recognize that discipline is most effective when<br/>
housed in the context of a loving relationship.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s OK to spank as long as you do it with love---and maybe not in <br/>
anger, right?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Also, the love shown is unconditional and not based on the child <br/>
performing or behaving in a<br/>
particular manner.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Or being ADD or ODD or ADHD? I hope.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Authoritarian:* Although the words authoritative and authoritarian <br/>
sound<br/>
similar, the parenting styles that are associated with each are very<br/>
different. Authoritarian parents are frequently not warm nor nurturing. <br/>
They<br/>
do not easily take their children&#39;s feelings into consideration and <br/>
tend to<br/>
be more rigid, imposing rules without discussing the rationale with <br/>
their<br/>
children. They are quick to say, &quot;You do it because I told you to do <br/>
it&quot; or<br/>
&quot;You do it because I&#39;m your mother (or father).&quot; They resort to <br/>
authority<br/>
and whether they realize it or not, they basically seek compliance and<br/>
obedience. Authoritarian parents may certainly show love, but more often<br/>
than not it is conditional, predicated on a child behaving in ways that<br/>
parents deem appropriate. Authoritarian parents are likely to resort to<br/>
corporal punishment rather than a problem-solving approach when they <br/>
feel<br/>
their children are not complying with their demands and/or have <br/>
transgressed<br/>
in some fashion.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yuck, yuck, yuck!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
*Permissive:* These parents are most noted for their failure to <br/>
establish<br/>
realistic goals, expectations, and limits for their children. Baumrind<br/>
identified two kinds of permissive parents, the *permissive-indulgent* <br/>
and<br/>
the *disengaged*. Permissive-indulgent parents may demonstrate love and<br/>
warmth, but they appear guided by the philosophy that &quot;children will <br/>
learn<br/>
on their own.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-==-=<br/>
<br/>
Well, children WILL learn on their own (we&#39;re hard-wired that way), but <br/>
they do so much better when they have a partner in the journey.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 They have difficulty setting rules and limits.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Have they every heard of principles instead? We have no rules here <br/>
(other than don&#39;t run around the pool!). Nor do we have arbitrary <br/>
liimits. Plenty of natural limits.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  The childbegins to &quot;rule the roost.&quot; If parents eventually attempt to <br/>
establish<br/>
limits and say &quot;no.&quot; the child will often resist, having become <br/>
accustomed<br/>
to being in charge.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Right, and if the parent were allowed to rule the roost and suddenly <br/>
the child tried to set limits and say no---do you think the parents <br/>
would resist? I see it at lunch when I look across the restaurant at <br/>
elderly parents out to lunch with their grown children. Everyone&#39;s <br/>
pissed off at each other. No balance. No respect. No kindness. No trust.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
 It is not unusual for the parents to become exhausted<br/>
and eventually defer to their child&#39;s demands.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Respect. Trust. Kindness. Generosity. In our lives there is no <br/>
deferring or demanding. It looks SOOO different from any of these <br/>
scenarios you&#39;ve brought us.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
So, can an unschooling family include parents who provide guidelines?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Better question: can an unschooling parent have a paradigm shift and <br/>
see what other options are available?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Like if a child shows interest in learning the electric guitar, the <br/>
parent buys<br/>
the guitar but establishes a rule that they keep the volume at a certain<br/>
level between certain hours (i.e. quiet enough for others to sleep <br/>
during<br/>
sleeping hours). Or must the parent let the child explore everything <br/>
the way<br/>
the child wants to?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Again---only two options???<br/>
<br/>
In our home, we buy the electric guitar and either keep it in the <br/>
garage music room OR get earphones so that the player can hear it but <br/>
not the rest of the house. OR talk about what&#39;s best for <br/>
*everyone*---loud as it will go when the guitarist is home alone, but <br/>
to be respectful of when others are around and need quiet.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;m surprised to hear someone suggest that children don&#39;t choose <br/>
to<br/>
eat trash. I&#39;ve seen many babies and toddlers on the playground putting<br/>
random things from the ground in their mouths, and many different <br/>
reactions<br/>
to that by parents.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
The child is exploring. He doesn&#39;t CHOOSE to eat trash---he&#39;s learning <br/>
what is and isn&#39;t pleasant to eat. He&#39;s FEELING and exploring the <br/>
items, not necessarily eating them.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re allowing him to get too near a corpse or trash, that&#39;s not <br/>
*his* fault---he&#39;s busy learning and exploring.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Smacking their hands and shaming them, redirecting,<br/>
explaining why eating trash is bad, letting them go ahead and eat the <br/>
trash,<br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
The best option at this toddler age is probably redirection. Pick him <br/>
up and move him to a safer location. Get him a cracker.<br/>
<br/>
But your child would *choose* to eat trash and dead birds?<br/>

Anyway, that&#39;s an example of why a rule is sometimes necessary. The<br/>
permissive parent would allow hitting the windows, I guess, and would <br/>
hope<br/>
the child &quot;learned a lesson&quot; if the windows happened to shatter and cut <br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
This is why we don&#39;t see ourselves as &quot;permissive&quot; but as &quot;mindful&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t see rules as necessary.<br/>
<br/>
If a child got hurt while his mom sat there, not caring or protecting, <br/>
he might feel abandoned and hurt that she didn&#39;t help. The &quot;lesson&quot; he <br/>
learned might be that mom doesn&#39;t care. He might learn that she&#39;s not <br/>
his partner.<br/>

<br/>
Exactly.<br/>
And anyone that thinks a 22 month old gives a darn about a rule or why<br/>
it&#39;s in place, they might be a bit delusional.;)<br/>
<br/>
At 22 months, they ARE going to hit things that can break if you give<br/>
them drumsticks. So set up a really cool area with pots and pans and<br/>
buckets and all sorts of fun things they CAN hit and re-direct them if<br/>
they get into something dangerous. They don&#39;t understand *why* they<br/>
shouldn&#39;t hit glass at that age, they just see something cool and want<br/>
to try it out.<br/>
<br/>
Keeping a young child safe is our responsibility. Taking care of our<br/>
property and homes is usually a concern for most of us. That doesn&#39;t<br/>
mean it takes rules to do that. It takes time and involvement though.<br/>
Lots of it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-178169405">I have a 26mo. I don&#39;t do &quot;rules&quot; because a) my son wants to explore<br/>
the reasons for things by himself and b) he would ignore it :) I can&#39;t<br/>
say he respects our reasoning at all until he decides whether or not<br/>
he agrees!<br/>
<br/>
So I never say &quot;this is a rule and you must follow it&quot; -- but we do<br/>
discuss things and how they might affect others, and make an example<br/>
of ourselves. If he&#39;s playing loudly I&#39;ll talk to him softly about how<br/>
it&#39;s late and you know how you can sometimes hear people through the<br/>
wall? They can hear us too but they might be trying to sleep and we<br/>
might be keeping them up. And like you said below we have to repeat<br/>
this every so often.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not perfect, but it&#39;s not arbitrary either and while he&#39;s not<br/>
very empathetic at the moment, I have high hopes. I don&#39;t think<br/>
they&#39;re &quot;necessary&quot;, but what is necessary for us is discussion and,<br/>
at this age, examples. Of course my main thing about rules is that I<br/>
don&#39;t like them either :)<br/>

Consensual living is a process, a philosophy, a mindset by which we<br/>
seek to live in harmony with our families and community. It involves<br/>
finding mutually agreed upon solutions, where the needs of both<br/>
parties are not only considered but addressed. Everyone&#39;s wants and<br/>
needs are equally valid, regardless of age. Conflicting wants or needs<br/>
are discussed and mutually agreeable solutions are created or<br/>
negotiated which meet the underlying needs of all parties. Beginners<br/>
to this concept are welcome to join this list, living consensually is<br/>
an ongoing process of discovery. We ask that you be open to or on the<br/>
path toward living consensually. We hope to explore the issues by<br/>
asking questions, and sharing our experiences. Parenting is a<br/>
sensitive issue for many people but we are all here to practice this<br/>
process, and can do so if the environment remains one of respect,<br/>
compassion, exploration and understanding. If you would like more<br/>
information about Consensual Living or would like to sign up for the<br/>
Consensual Living Newsletter, please visit our web site:<br/>

Hi Amy, <br/>
<br/>
You can start right here. :-) Search the archives and you&#39;ll find this <br/>
topic intertwined in so many discussions here. Maybe ask a question or <br/>
talk about what you&#39;d like to change. :-)<br/>

   This seems to have become a semantic discussion to some extent. (One<br/>
definition of the word &quot;rule&quot; is &quot;a principle,&quot; so one could argue that <br/>
if<br/>
you live by principles, you are living by rules.)<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Examining the words a bit more might make it clearer.<br/>
<br/>
We can help.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m hearing that most of you would not simply allow your child to be <br/>
loud<br/>
late at night or do something they don&#39;t realize is dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
See? Although, by law, I DO have the right to allow and not allow my <br/>
children to do all sorts of things, It&#39;s NOT that I &quot;simply would not <br/>
allow&quot; it. It&#39;s that *I* don&#39;t need to. We all understand that it&#39;s not <br/>
OK to disturb others&#39; sleep. And it&#39;s not just being loud at <br/>
night---it&#39;s also when someone&#39;s napping at 2:00pm. That&#39;s respect. <br/>
It&#39;s not a rule.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t &quot;not allow&quot; them to do things they don&#39;t realize are dangerous. <br/>
We talk about the things. We try to find solutions or alternatives. We <br/>
work together. I *trust* that they don&#39;t *want* to do dangerous things <br/>
or harm themselves or others. They trust *me* to keep them safe. No <br/>
rules, just trust.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Indeed you are not permissive.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, we know. &lt;g&gt; But we are perceived as being permissive.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
You go about guiding the child not through setting<br/>
arbitrary rules (not something I ever suggested BTW), but by discussion <br/>
that<br/>
furthers your child&#39;s understanding, for example.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Right---but we still &quot;allow&quot; them to make their own decisions, even if <br/>
it&#39;s not the one we&#39;d chose---*there&#39;s* the rub! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
So guidance seems to be a big part of unschooling, and that was really <br/>
my<br/>
question.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yes, but not guidance towards what we know is the only <br/>
way/answer/decision. Our children may make a different choice. We need <br/>
to understand and respect and trust that that is OK.<br/>

One definition of the word &quot;collie&quot; is &quot;a dog,&quot; so one could argue that <br/>
if you live with a dog, you are living with a collie.<br/>
<br/>
My beagle would disagree.<br/>
<br/>
Semantics are important when we&#39;re discussing how to change our <br/>
thinking.<br/>

effect the way we think about things.  For a long time learning <br/>
about unschooling I felt like I had to translate into a different <br/>
language. Ideas that had previously made sense to me had <br/>
connotations I hadn&#39;t thought of before and I was baffled, trying to <br/>
express what I thought I knew. Somewhere along the way I started <br/>
*thinking* in this weird other parenting language. <br/>
<br/>

boards and websites to get a better understanding of the ....hmmm, <br/>
jargon, for want of a better word, of unschooling. &quot;Rules-vs-<br/>
principles&quot; is a good example:<br/>

guess what we really mean from what we&#39;ve unclearly written. We  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t require others to spend a lot of time asking questions to  <br/>
