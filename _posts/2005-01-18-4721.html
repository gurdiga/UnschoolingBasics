&quot;Tell him that learning is like walking and school is like spinning. If  <br/>
you&#39;ve been spinning for 6 years and stop and then try to walk, you&#39;re going to  <br/>
keep spinning. In order to walk straight you need a period of not spinning. So  <br/>
for now declare life as a period of not spinning.&quot;<br/>
