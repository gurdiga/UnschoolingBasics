THE DAILY GROOVE ~ by Scott Noelle<br/>
www.enjoyparenting.com/dailygroove<br/>
<br/>
:: Beyond Right and Wrong ::<br/>
<br/>
Children are born knowing that feeling good is more important than<br/>
being &quot;right.&quot; They know their emotions are their Inner Guidance, and<br/>
they trust it.<br/>
<br/>
So why do they sometimes rebel and seem to care more about being<br/>
right? One possibility is that you may be telling them something that<br/>
contradicts their Inner Guidance.<br/>
<br/>
For example, if you say &quot;It&#39;s time to go,&quot; while their Inner Guidance<br/>
tells them to stay, they know you&#39;re talking crazy talk!<br/>
<br/>
If you say &quot;You shouldn&#39;t touch that,&quot; while their instinct is to<br/>
explore, one of you is lying... and it&#39;s not them!<br/>
<br/>
You can end conflict and transcend right/wrong thinking by tuning in<br/>
to *your* Inner Guidance. Give it some time... The heart is slower<br/>
than the head, but it&#39;s wiser, too.<br/>
<br/>
If you go deep enough, you&#39;ll find the place where your Guidance and<br/>
their Guidance overlap -- the common ground where everyday miracles<br/>
are born.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-731629842">I think Scott&#39;s daily says something really useful.  Children don&#39;t see<br/>
right and wrong so much as the need or wish for something.  Right/wrong is<br/>
culturally induced thinking.  It can be useful but with children it helps to<br/>
take each individual instance and (this is why unschooling is so great) find<br/>
some way for what they want to happen at least to some degree.  Right/wrong<br/>
doesn&#39;t help much until after certain stages of development occur.  Children<br/>
may &quot;seem&quot; to understand the concepts because they can say the words &quot;right&quot;<br/>
and &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no.&quot;  At first, children see the world as full of<br/>
possibilities.  They tend to ignore obstacles and plunge in.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually children begin to experience some options as better than<br/>
others... as in, such and such works better for what we&#39;re trying to do in<br/>
some situation, but in some other situation, another option might work<br/>
best.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a learning process for all of us.  Maybe one of the greatest things<br/>
that happens to people is to have children who wake them back up to the<br/>
world of wonder and possibilities, which many of us have long forgotten.<br/>
Right and wrong are not the only important options that work well.  There&#39;s<br/>
a whole lot more to it than than and having only right/wrong to choose from<br/>
is a very limited set of options.<br/>
<br/>
What if we were to see everything as a range of available options, a<br/>
spectrum if you will, that yields infinite degrees of &quot;gray&quot; and other<br/>
&quot;colors&quot; ...not just the &quot;black&quot; and &quot;white&quot; of right/wrong?<br/>
