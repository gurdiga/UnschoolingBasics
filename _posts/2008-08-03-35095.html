<div id="ygrps-yiv-1690932407">I&#39;m not sure if any of you will remember me, I wrote once about my <br/>
son previously.  He attended K in a public school only to have  <br/>
several incidents with adults that frightened him (teachers yelling, <br/>
principal refusing to let me take him out of school when he was sick <br/>
so she restrained him and ordered me out of the school etc) and <br/>
repeated incidents with a child bullying him.  So since late Sept of <br/>
this year we pulled him from PS and I&#39;ve been trying to learn about <br/>
unschooling.  I&#39;ll admit that not all of it comes easy to me, but I&#39;m <br/>
trying.  Which leads me to my first problem.  He attends speech <br/>
therapy with a private SLP for verbal apraxia.  He likes her and goes <br/>
willingly.  Problem is that she is asking me to do &quot;homework&quot; with <br/>
him and what he might do willingly for her, he does NOT want to do at <br/>
home with me.  She has him writing short stories trying to help him <br/>
learn to be more comfortable with whole language.  He does not want <br/>
to write ANY thing at home.  It becomes a real battle which makes <br/>
both of us miserable.  I&#39;ve told the SLP this and that I don&#39;t want <br/>
to force him to do it.  She says that I should never have to force <br/>
him so it&#39;s the way I&#39;m presenting it.  She told me instead of asking <br/>
him to do the work that I should set a timer, then it&#39;s his choice to <br/>
do the work or not.  She said that she thinks he should go back to <br/>
school because he doesn&#39;t have any problems doing the work for her.  <br/>
Of course that hooks into my fears that I&#39;m doing it &quot;wrong&quot;.  This <br/>
is a child that tests out at having a moderate to severe language <br/>
disability and graphomotor disabilites but who is very bright.  Thing <br/>
is he becomes VERY frustrated and angry when he can&#39;t get his point <br/>
across.  That is what drives me to take him to this private SLP <br/>
especially since he likes her BUT I&#39;m uncomfortable with what she is <br/>
asking me to do at home.  <br/>
<br/>
Second problem, and I apologize for the length of this!  My son <br/>
turned 7 at the end of April.  He is on a gymnastics team and loves <br/>
it.  Problem: all team members have to attend gymnastics camp which <br/>
entails 2 weeks of 3 days a week from 9:00 - 4:00.  He attended one <br/>
day willingly and when I went in at 3:00 to watch and pick him up I <br/>
found him pale and near tears.  I asked him if he was okay and he <br/>
told me, &quot;Some of it&#39;s fun but there&#39;s a stupid game and the lady <br/>
upstairs was mad at me.&quot;  There&#39;s another exercise business <br/>
upstairs and the woman is retired military and very aggressive.  <br/>
Turns out he was dropping a bean bag down over the balcony and she <br/>
told him to, &quot;Get out of here&quot; and gave the thumb jerk.  We discussed <br/>
only going upstairs to use the bathroom and to eat and not giving the <br/>
woman any chance to be grumpy but come the next camp day he stayed 10 <br/>
minutes and started crying that his stomach hurt.  I took him home <br/>
and we spent the next week just hanging out and we bought a 4 square <br/>
ball to practice the &quot;stupid game&quot; ;)  Now he is willing to go but <br/>
he&#39;s asked that I stay the entire time.  I&#39;ve done that two days and <br/>
am very willing to do it (he has 3 more days required to attend) <br/>
but &quot;other&quot; people have expressed concern that he has SEPERATION <br/>
problems.  I&#39;m worried about the way the coaches and the other kids <br/>
will treat him.  Already one coach told him gruffly not to worry <br/>
about his mom.  I had gone to the bathroom, thinking he saw where I <br/>
went but he hadn&#39;t and he thought I left and started crying.  This is <br/>
a child that still co-sleeps so I&#39;m hearing pressure even from his <br/>
Dad about his not being able to separate and how I&#39;m creating <br/>
problems for him.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s bad enough that I question myself that I&#39;m not creative <br/>
enough to do unschooling but to have people suggesting that I&#39;m <br/>
actually hurting him by not teaching him enough or that I&#39;m coddling <br/>
him is making me lose sleep.  <br/>
<br/>
I respect a lot of what I&#39;ve read here over the months, does anyone <br/>
have insight on my situation?<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-651429670">Oh, I feel for you my dear - our familes and the people closest to us can cause so much more pain when we&#39;re already struggling with ourselves and our children.  It is so hard to ignore them, but I think that is what you have to do - you have to do what *you* KNOW is the best thing for your child - our culture is very cruel to children, asyou have expereinced in the public system already - I mean, what is the point of that?  It just makes me spitting mad sometimes why they think they have to be so *mean* to children!<br/>
<br/>
Keep him home - take care of him - you don&#39;t have to do any of the &quot;work&quot;: it&#39;s not necessary.  If he likes going to the therapist, then fine, but don&#39;t insist that he do the &quot;work&quot; at home if he doesn&#39;t want to and if she won&#39;t accept that then stop seeing her.  He will learn in his own time and in his own way if you are with him.  If the gym won&#39;t let you stay or is making him ashamed of it, leave.  He doen&#39;t need organized classes for anything - kids are the most natural gymnasts in the world.  <br/>
<br/>
Strangers who don&#39;t know our children have no right making value judgements about how we choose to raise our children. Don&#39;t let them make you feel guilty, don&#39;t give in to them, don&#39;t listen to them.  You don&#39;t need them and your son certainly doesn&#39;t - keep reading about unschooling here and anything else you can get your hands on - <br/>
<br/>
what&#39;s important is the authentic connection between you and your child - school doesn&#39;t do that and our culture has come to believe that it must break the bond between parents and children (especially *mothers* and sons!) - does the term &quot;patriarchy&quot; come to mind?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s very hard to resist the interference of family and people close to you when they are telling you you are wrong - but hang tough my dear - you owe it to your son.  <br/>
<br/>
Good luck and much empathy...Judy R. in kingston ontario<br/>

 <br/>
The SLP is a service. You are the client. She does not get to tell you what to do at home.<br/>
She does not get to tell you your decision to homeschool is wrong. YOU are the mother.,<br/>
YOU make the decisions.<br/>
Tell her that. If your son wants to continue the therapy that is how is going to be from now on.<br/>
If it was me I would not have my child in speech therapy since I know 3  kids/people who grew put of it completely with just time and no &quot;work&quot; including my father who  did stutter.<br/>

It is awesome that your son co-sleeps. The mainstream wants kids to be independent too early.<br/>
Can you find another gym for him with a more understanding coach?<br/>
My niece( that has pretty mainstream but understanding parents) was still sucking her thumb at 14-15 yo ( when stressed)<br/>
and her coach knew it.<br/>
They never made a big deal out of it. She was supported.<br/>
Find another coach or be there if your son wants you to and wants to stay in this gym.<br/>
My 6 year old still sleeps with me and I remember that my brothers slept with my parents until their early teen years.<br/>
Its very commom for families to sleep together in other societies.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-242865860">I agree Judy.  Patriarchy is a reason but not a good excuse for what we do<br/>
to boys in this culture.  It&#39;s a systematic attempt to de-emotionalize<br/>
boys.  Girls are encouraged to emote all they want to.  Boys are put down<br/>
and shamed for shows of emotion.  If I were to allow that to happen to my<br/>
son, and it has happened because of the way the culture is, then the natural<br/>
outcome is for boys to conclude that the only acceptable emotion is ANGER.<br/>
Day to day life is supposed to be the other alternative --- stuff your<br/>
emotions...... which just starts a huge backlog that eventually comes out as<br/>
really big anger.  Hello?  Awful cycle.  Boys are human beings and don&#39;t<br/>
need to live up to the &quot;strong silent&quot; stereotype.  They need a full range<br/>
of expression, not to be bottled and seen as &quot;bad&quot; for having feelings,<br/>
which are unavoidable.<br/>
<br/>
The bond of mother and son is a fine one and not to be messed with in my<br/>
opinion.  I really don&#39;t give a hoot what anyone else thinks about the<br/>
mother/son bond between me and Karl.  If the bond between child and parent<br/>
is broken too early, the child has a much harder dealing with people and<br/>
understand what they&#39;re like.  They need to know.<br/>

&gt; especially since he likes her BUT I&#39;m uncomfortable with what she is<br/>
&gt; asking me to do at home.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Second problem, and I apologize for the length of this! My son<br/>
&gt; turned 7 at the end of April. He is on a gymnastics team and loves<br/>
&gt; it. Problem: all team members have to attend gymnastics camp which<br/>
&gt; entails 2 weeks of 3 days a week from 9:00 - 4:00. He attended one<br/>
&gt; day willingly and when I went in at 3:00 to watch and pick him up I<br/>
&gt; found him pale and near tears. I asked him if he was okay and he<br/>
&gt; told me, &quot;Some of it&#39;s fun but there&#39;s a stupid game and the lady<br/>
&gt; upstairs was mad at me.&quot; There&#39;s another exercise business<br/>
&gt; upstairs and the woman is retired military and very aggressive.<br/>
&gt; Turns out he was dropping a bean bag down over the balcony and she<br/>
&gt; told him to, &quot;Get out of here&quot; and gave the thumb jerk. We discussed<br/>
&gt; only going upstairs to use the bathroom and to eat and not giving the<br/>
&gt; woman any chance to be grumpy but come the next camp day he stayed 10<br/>
&gt; minutes and started crying that his stomach hurt. I took him home<br/>
&gt; and we spent the next week just hanging out and we bought a 4 square<br/>
&gt; ball to practice the &quot;stupid game&quot; ;) Now he is willing to go but<br/>
&gt; he&#39;s asked that I stay the entire time. I&#39;ve done that two days and<br/>
&gt; am very willing to do it (he has 3 more days required to attend)<br/>
&gt; but &quot;other&quot; people have expressed concern that he has SEPERATION<br/>
&gt; problems. I&#39;m worried about the way the coaches and the other kids<br/>
&gt; will treat him. Already one coach told him gruffly not to worry<br/>
&gt; about his mom. I had gone to the bathroom, thinking he saw where I<br/>
&gt; went but he hadn&#39;t and he thought I left and started crying. This is<br/>
&gt; a child that still co-sleeps so I&#39;m hearing pressure even from his<br/>
&gt; Dad about his not being able to separate and how I&#39;m creating<br/>
&gt; problems for him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think it&#39;s bad enough that I question myself that I&#39;m not creative<br/>
&gt; enough to do unschooling but to have people suggesting that I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; actually hurting him by not teaching him enough or that I&#39;m coddling<br/>
&gt; him is making me lose sleep.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I respect a lot of what I&#39;ve read here over the months, does anyone<br/>

&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-848909929">Dear Sarah,<br/>
 <br/>
My son is 6 years old. He is larger than any other boy his age that I have met- all over larger, not just heavy. This makes many people believe that he is older than he is, and they expect him to act in a more &quot;mature&quot; way than he does. Your story struck a chord with me because I have also had other adults treat my son with disrespect and scorn because of his &quot;clinginess&quot; and &quot;separation anxiety&quot;. My own husband agrees with them, and sometimes refers to my son, behind his back, as &quot;The Barnacle&quot;. I hate this, and it causes some tension in the house, but I am not going to allow anyone to question my instincts about what I know is truly best for my boy, not even my husband.<br/>
 <br/>
He spent part of last year in kindergarten because I thought it would be fun. I really thought kindergarten would be more about playing and meeting other children than about obeying and listening and keeping quiet and sitting still. What a shock I received when I started volunteering at the school because my son was clearly NOT having fun and would cry when we started getting ready for school each morning. About 8 weeks into the school year I pulled him out, and he has been home with me every day since. We still sleep together in the family bed. I go with him everywhere that he wants to go- science camp, soccer, art class, etc. I check to make sure that my presence is acceptable before signing up for activities. I even sit next to him on the floor during the local library story hour. This is all because he *wants* me there. He *wants* to be with me, close to me, as much as possible. <br/>
 <br/>
Don&#39;t doubt your instincts to take care of your son and to stay close to him. I think that when you do what is right, it feels right, and when you do what is &quot;wrong&quot;, you can change and try something else until you find the &quot;right&quot; thing.<br/>
 <br/>
As for the teacher, I would ask her to consider working with you in a different way. There must be some other way for your son to get help from her. Have you really brainstormed about other ways? I would seriously think long and hard about what the goal is and how to get there without the pain and struggle you and he are experiencing. And then go to her with your ideas. If he is not participating, he has a good reason. You could talk with him about what&#39;s not working, and find out what his thoughts and ideas are. When I talk with my son and he tells me his thoughts and ideas, he has solved some pretty serious problems.<br/>
 <br/>
One last thing- don&#39;t worry about &quot;being an unschooler&quot;. Just be you, and your son&#39;s mom. Your goals will change, and so will his. Your interests, your energy level, your motivation, and his- it&#39;s all between you and him. If you are doing what you and he want, when you and he want, then you are &quot;unschoolers&quot;. What happens between the two of you is what will define your unschooling days and your unschooling life. You guys are in charge! Enjoy it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1822709100">I still hear my mother in law&#39;s words in my head. The day I came home from the hospital with my daughter, it was, IMHO, the wisest piece of advice any one ever gave me. &quot;Follow your gut, only you truly know that child.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I found it is wiser to &quot;pick your battles&quot; with your children. The point of home schooling is that you decide what your children are learning and what their assignments are. Thank the counselor for her advice but that you know what works best for your son at home. Maybe look into something that will work for you and your son and let the counselor know about it and ask her to help you gauge his progress from there. I stuttered when I was growing up and did quite well without therapy, I work in a call center. <br/>
<br/>
As for co-sleeping, we have done that with both of our children. My daughter chose to go into her own bed in her own time. My son still sleeps with us some nights. Honestly, I didn&#39;t know there was a name for it when we started co-sleeping. It started from total exhaustion, I simply brought my daughter to bed with us so she could nurse at her leisure and I could still get some sleep. It worked so well we did with our son as well. I swear that is why they made large beds. <br/>
<br/>
Separation anxiety. That is a lovely term that I have had explained to me as &quot;mom it&#39;s time to let go of the little one&quot;. Not true. I lost a part of my daughter when she went to public school and came under the influence of children whose parents do not have the same values we do. The school systems we have been in do not have the same values as we do. No it&#39;s not time to let go until they are ready to go out in the world on their own. And how will they do that successfully? From learning from us, their parents. Our mistakes, our triumphs influence them. Making them grow up at such young ages doesn&#39;t prepare them for the world it causes them more problems in the long run, they miss out on the fun of being a child. Playing, having fun, no large cares to consider. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-674754017">Sarah, <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I remember you - your son and mine are about the same age (about six months<br/>
apart). We have also had similar experiences. PS wanted me to put my son in<br/>
speech therapy because he is tongue tied.  It isn&#39;t why I took him out and I<br/>
had also never planned to send him to PS but I thought at this magical age<br/>
I&#39;d start handing him worksheets and he would happily do them. (I hated<br/>
worksheets - groaned internally at even looking for them but thought he<br/>
would like them. lol.) I didn&#39;t know about unschooling then and so didn&#39;t<br/>
know that is what I had been doing. I was lucky enough to find a supportive<br/>
group about the same time we took him out of public school.  I have had my<br/>
doubts but he has learned so much and with me basically just making what he<br/>
wants available. Anyway, yes, my son has had problems saying some sounds -<br/>
he still finds it easier to say thinger instead of finger but just from<br/>
guidance and clarifying new words as well as making a game of making faces<br/>
with emphasis on sticking out your tongue. He is easy to understand and<br/>
confident if sometimes quiet. He can also lick his lips with no surgery. The<br/>
best thing about homeschooling is being able to help your child as you see<br/>
fit. the hard part is having to constantly research how to do it. (I know<br/>
once they get older I will have to do it less and I will miss it.) If<br/>
pulling him from the therapy is not a comfortable option at this time,<br/>
discuss other ways to help him as home. There is always some goal or<br/>
objective.  Explain to the therapist that you are not comfortable enforcing<br/>
homework but you will help him find ways to practice more if you know what<br/>
the objective is. She is the facilitator to fulfill a need but your son<br/>
needs to be ready for it - if he isn&#39;t he won&#39;t be receptive to it.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Never apologize for length. when you want detailed help - you need to give<br/>
the details. Perhaps your son does have separation issues but if he did<br/>
would you force him away? My husband often sleeps in a separate room from me<br/>
cause I have one kid and he has another since we have three sometimes one of<br/>
us has more then one. Sometimes only daddy will do and he gets all three -<br/>
since he goes to work and they don&#39;t get the time with him that they do with<br/>
me - I think it a way for them to balance it. There are times my son is<br/>
ready to be away from me and other times he isn&#39;t. He loves visiting but he<br/>
wants to come home to sleep. Sometimes even when visiting family far away<br/>
with mom and/or dad he wants to go home.  Anyway, if he needs you with him<br/>
and you can be. be there.  My son used to be afraid I would leave him and<br/>
would often melt down if he couldn&#39;t find me. I just constantly remind him<br/>
where to meet if I get lost and that I will never leave without him. He also<br/>
knows some simple signs like &quot;ready to go&quot;, help, bathroom, ok, stop and I<br/>
love you so that communication that most people miss can be done across the<br/>
room. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I &quot;teach&quot; Quentin very little but he &quot;learns&quot; so much. Every time I start to<br/>
worry, he regales some stranger about something I thought he wasn&#39;t even<br/>
paying attention to. I love learning and so I watch stuff on my interests or<br/>
in research his interests which I play in the living room. If you are<br/>
worried about what he is learning, just write a journal of what he does even<br/>
playing video games and watching tv. If you can&#39;t figure out what he is<br/>
learning; email the list and I bet a few of us can tell you and tell you how<br/>
to build on it if it seems he is interested.  I do educational reviews for<br/>
unschoolers. I love making every day learning into schoolese for the public<br/>
school system and the &quot;worried&quot; friends and family.<br/>
<br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if any of you will remember me, I wrote once about my <br/>
son previously. He attended K in a public school only to have <br/>
several incidents with adults that frightened him (teachers yelling, <br/>
principal refusing to let me take him out of school when he was sick <br/>
so she restrained him and ordered me out of the school etc) and <br/>
repeated incidents with a child bullying him. So since late Sept of <br/>
this year we pulled him from PS and I&#39;ve been trying to learn about <br/>
unschooling. I&#39;ll admit that not all of it comes easy to me, but I&#39;m <br/>
trying. Which leads me to my first problem. He attends speech <br/>
therapy with a private SLP for verbal apraxia. He likes her and goes <br/>
willingly. Problem is that she is asking me to do &quot;homework&quot; with <br/>
him and what he might do willingly for her, he does NOT want to do at <br/>
home with me. She has him writing short stories trying to help him <br/>
learn to be more comfortable with whole language. He does not want <br/>
to write ANY thing at home. It becomes a real battle which makes <br/>
both of us miserable. I&#39;ve told the SLP this and that I don&#39;t want <br/>
to force him to do it. She says that I should never have to force <br/>
him so it&#39;s the way I&#39;m presenting it. She told me instead of asking <br/>
him to do the work that I should set a timer, then it&#39;s his choice to <br/>
do the work or not. She said that she thinks he should go back to <br/>
school because he doesn&#39;t have any problems doing the work for her. <br/>
Of course that hooks into my fears that I&#39;m doing it &quot;wrong&quot;. This <br/>
is a child that tests out at having a moderate to severe language <br/>
disability and graphomotor disabilites but who is very bright. Thing <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-132009261">Just wanted to chime in on the speech thing.  My dh&#39;s family is/was very concerned about my son&#39;s speech (he&#39;s 5) and I&#39;m just NOT.  He has been practicing his L sound by holding up his fingers in the shape of an L and saying LOSER.  I told him to reserve that word for daddy : ) and he can call me LOVELY : )  Anyhow, he has had SOOOO much fun doing this.  It is the second sound he has mastered in just a couple of months.  The first one was TH when our dog Thor died.  BTW he is also tongue tied.  I have given him the option of us helping him with his speech, or going to see a speech therapist, but in his usual fashion, he knows he&#39;ll just figure it out on his own.  He is sometimes bothered when others can&#39;t understand him (happens very rarely) because he has soooo much to say and loves to hold conversations.<br/>

woman any chance to be grumpy but come the next camp day he stayed 10 <br/>
minutes and started crying that his stomach hurt. I took him home <br/>
and we spent the next week just hanging out and we bought a 4 square <br/>
ball to practice the &quot;stupid game&quot; ;) Now he is willing to go but <br/>
he&#39;s asked that I stay the entire time. I&#39;ve done that two days and <br/>
am very willing to do it (he has 3 more days required to attend) <br/>
but &quot;other&quot; people have expressed concern that he has SEPERATION <br/>
problems. I&#39;m worried about the way the coaches and the other kids <br/>
will treat him. Already one coach told him gruffly not to worry <br/>
about his mom. I had gone to the bathroom, thinking he saw where I <br/>
went but he hadn&#39;t and he thought I left and started crying. This is <br/>
a child that still co-sleeps so I&#39;m hearing pressure even from his <br/>
Dad about his not being able to separate and how I&#39;m creating <br/>
problems for him.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s bad enough that I question myself that I&#39;m not creative <br/>
enough to do unschooling but to have people suggesting that I&#39;m <br/>
actually hurting him by not teaching him enough or that I&#39;m coddling <br/>
him is making me lose sleep. <br/>
<br/>
I respect a lot of what I&#39;ve read here over the months, does anyone <br/>
have insight on my situation?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for taking the time to read this!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-402219271">THANK YOU!  All of you who wrote.  It&#39;s so nice to hear that there <br/>
are other people out there who are not critical of my decisions.  I&#39;m <br/>
really touched by your kindness that you would take the time to read <br/>
and respond.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for those who shared their situations with me.  Apraxia is  <br/>
very confusing and frustrating.  My son has worked very, very hard to <br/>
be able to speak clearly because it was more than important to him, <br/>
even at a very young age, that people understand him.  I remember him <br/>
sobbing because I could not understand what he was saying even at the <br/>
age of 3.  Now his articulation is very good but he struggles to be <br/>
able to explain what happened or what he saw etc.  He wants very much <br/>
to be part of conversations.  Apraxia affects the ability to motor <br/>
plan but it does not affect intelligence.  Someone told me once that <br/>
you could liken it to someone with a stroke.  They KNOW what they <br/>
want to say but the messages get mixed up on the way to the mouth.  <br/>
Right now I find the hardest part to be that some people believe that <br/>
since he CAN articulate words correctly or near correctly that he <br/>
should be able to answer their questions or test verbally.  They do <br/>
not understand that it&#39;s more complicated, that saying a word in <br/>
isolation is one thing but putting it in a sentence is a whole <br/>
different ball of wax.  Does he really need the SLP?  I&#39;m on the <br/>
fence so I think as long as he wants to go see her I&#39;ll keep taking <br/>
him.  I do think a talk with her is in order though as several of you <br/>
suggested.<br/>
<br/>
As for the gymnastics - I spoke to the owner/head coach and he has NO <br/>
problem with my being there.  He apologized that the woman upstairs <br/>
had frightened my son and said he would speak to her.  I was also <br/>
able to speak to one other coach and she was very understanding.  She <br/>
said that what ever I needed to do was fine with her and she <br/>
commended me for taking the time to be there for him.  As for the two <br/>
other coaches that think he should &quot;Get over it&quot;, oh <br/>
well!                <br/>
<br/>
Lastly, Brian thank you very much for your list of <br/>
suggestions/reading.  I&#39;ve got book order to go do! :)<br/>
<br/>
Thank you again!<br/>

<br/>
tongue-tied. Clearly it shouldn&#39;t be called tongur-tied for folks who can&#39;t<br/>
roll their rs. That would be cruel. <br/>

I didn&#39;t realize it was called &quot;tongur-tied&quot; . I was tongue-tied. And then I<br/>
went down a steep driveway on a bike without handlebar covers. The ensuing<br/>
accident severed the tie. I had 3 popsicles at the hospital to prep my mouth<br/>
for stitches. It seemed a pretty good deal. The only noted difference was<br/>
that I could curl my tongue after the accident. Maybe not right after. <br/>

**I am extremely tongue tied. Pretty much the only time I notice it is<br/>
when I eat an ice cream cone. I get a kind of uncomfortable pulling<br/>
feeling - but not nearly uncomfortable enough to dissuade me from eating<br/>
ice cream cones. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s true that I can&#39;t trill my r. Haven&#39;t had any complaints on the<br/>
kissing :o), although I do remember worrying about it when I was a kid. <br/>

Rowan, who&#39;s 11, is also very tongue tied. So far it hasn&#39;t caused her<br/>
any problems at all. ~Rue<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1485338658">I have a friend who&#39;s child is tongue tied ... the surgeon they were<br/>
referred to told her to give him lots of ice cream cones and lollipops<br/>
to help him stretch it !    The surgeon said it just wasn&#39;t<br/>
recommended unless the child could barely move their tongues... he<br/>
felt more comfortable waiting to see if things improved with working<br/>
naturally on getting more movement.  <br/>
<br/>
He is now 13 (and has significant other special needs due to a genetic<br/>
syndrome) but is a master of the ice cream cone!  <br/>

natives do:  they call it the &quot;soft r&quot; (r moscio)...there is no real<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I followed the advice of a less-well-known linguist (Suzette Haden Elgin <br/>
for obscure SF fans) and spoke along with the language tapes (the <br/>
speaker on the tape and I spoke at the same time). Other teachers and <br/>
linguists say to never do that, to always repeat what the speaker said <br/>
after they speak, but that doesn&#39;t allow the &quot;magic&quot; to happen, in my <br/>
experience. To my surprise, my mouth just started producing the rolled <br/>
&quot;r&quot; and the throat-clearing &quot;ach&quot; (like St. Sultz (sp?) from Hogan&#39;s <br/>
Heroes, but now I really am dating myself!). I didn&#39;t try at all, they <br/>
just started happening after several months of working with tapes of <br/>
native speakers. But I am a strong believer in learning new languages <br/>
the same way we learned our first (natural language learning or <br/>
immersion methods). Our brains are amazing magic makers when it comes to <br/>
pattern and language. IMO.<br/>
<br/>
BTW I was teaching myself Irish Gaelic using Buntus Cainte but I&#39;d use <br/>
something like the Destinos programs (for Spanish) or the Muzzy shows if <br/>
they were available. I had to try to create my own &quot;immersion&quot; as best I <br/>
could because there weren&#39;t any natural language materials available at <br/>
the time that I could find for Irish Gaelic.<br/>
