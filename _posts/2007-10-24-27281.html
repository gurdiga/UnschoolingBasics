<div id="ygrps-yiv-1770234170">Hi All,<br/>
I can&#39;t remember if I posted an intro on this list!  I&#39;m on so many <br/>
lists now. I can&#39;t keep up! We moved to Coastal NC a year ago (from <br/>
New York) and we are still trying to find kindred spirits out here. <br/>
I haven&#39;t met 1 unschooler in this area so it was refreshing to be <br/>
at the Live & Learn this year. We found out about this list from <br/>
Gail when we were at the Live and Learn.<br/>
<br/>
How do unschoolers set boundaries or limits without using threats <br/>
(&quot;take this away or that away...if you don&#39;t&quot;)? When the child is <br/>
doing something that is not okay (like, when she gets angry she will <br/>
try to hit me sometimes). This is what we grew up with (punitive and <br/>
threats) and it feels wrong, but unsure of what to replace it with.  <br/>
My daughter is 5 and very much her own person and strong willed. I&#39;m <br/>
kind of muddling through figuring out how to approach <br/>
her &quot;differently&quot; - is there a general gentle approach?  What does <br/>
it look like?<br/>

 <br/>
I know you&#39;ll get some great responses to your questions here.  I have  to <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1641730070">Hi Janna!<br/>
<br/>
I am pretty new to the list too and my youngest has &quot;anger issues&quot; although<br/>
I don&#39;t really think she has a problem or anything, it just helps to use<br/>
those words to describe what I see.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, something that REALLY helped my dd&#39;s anger was taking away ALL red<br/>
dye (and yellow too, but mostly red) from her system.  It has helped more<br/>
than I can even describe in words.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I am not sure this was the RIGHT thing to do, but it also seemed to<br/>
help.  Lilly would first direct her anger to her sister or to the girl I<br/>
babysit so I told her that if she needed to hit someone, to hit me.  She<br/>
never did hit me (or if she did it was only once) and the hitting others<br/>
seemed to stop as well.  I also suggested (at the same time I told her to<br/>
direct her anger at me if she needed to) that she might hit other things<br/>
such as beds, couches, pillow, blankets, etc.  I have &quot;caught&quot; her hitting<br/>
these things and biting blankets.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that helps you come up with some ideas and I am sure so many others<br/>
will have valuable advice as well.<br/>

<br/>
Have you joined the NC Unschoolers list?  My friend Alice lives in<br/>
Havelock on the coast, but they&#39;ll be moving out here eventually (they<br/>
already have a house in Asheville but won&#39;t move over all the way for<br/>
a while).<br/>
I know there aren&#39;t many unschoolers out that way, she&#39;s been<br/>
frustrated too. Lots of unschoolers out this way in the<br/>
Asheville/Eastern TN area.:)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>***The first thing that comes to mind is not to make your child wrong <br/>
for her feelings.  Hitting or anger is an expression of something.  <br/>
And for you to acknowledge how frustrated your daughter is in the <br/>
moment and approach her with compassion for her frustration instead <br/>
of judgment of her behaviour may make all the difference in your <br/>
acceptance of her and your ability to help navigate the moment <br/>
without attempting to control with threats, coercive abitrary <br/>
boundaries, or punitive measures - as we are so conditioned to <br/>
believe that that is the way to control another person smaller than <br/>
oneself.  <br/>
<br/>
The truth is as soon as you let go of the idea that you can control <br/>
another person you can approach the situation in a whole other way.  <br/>
There&#39;s nothing wrong with simply saying to someone (anyone) i don&#39;t <br/>
like to be hit or please don&#39;t yell at me.  And in some instances <br/>
with some kids that is enough information for them to alter their <br/>
form of communication or behavior in the moment.  But maybe not for <br/>
your 5 year old who is very much in her moment of frustration or <br/>
anger or whatever pain she is feeling that perciptitates behaviour <br/>
that is making *you* uncomfortable.  Which brings me to another point <br/>
to look at - your comfort level with your daughters expression of her <br/>
will.  I know Leia and her will is beautiful to behold.  Can you <br/>
shift your internal response from one of discomfort to one of <br/>
admiration that she is one who can clearly express herself with <br/>
directness and strength?***<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is what we grew up with (punitive and <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; threats) and it feels wrong, but unsure of what to replace it <br/>
 </span></blockquote>with.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My daughter is 5 and very much her own person and strong willed. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; kind of muddling through figuring out how to approach <br/>
&gt; her &quot;differently&quot; - is there a general gentle approach?  What does <br/>
&gt; it look like?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>***Yes there is a different way - it looks like extreme patience.  <br/>
Yes there is a different way and it looks like extreme expression of <br/>
love and acceptance.  And to an outsider it won&#39;t look like you are <br/>
attempting to control your daughter - because you are not attempting <br/>
to control your daughter.  You will be responding to her with <br/>
compassion and perhaps shifting the enviroment or protecting her from <br/>
external judgements.  <br/>
<br/>
It will look like you don&#39;t care what other people around you think <br/>
because you are not concerned with being &quot;gentle&quot; per se but rather <br/>
it will look like you are secure in your response to your daughter.  <br/>
It will look like you know what you are doing and *your* behavior <br/>
will not be punishing, complaining, blaming, threatening, nagging, <br/>
criticizing, and bribing.  <br/>
<br/>
Your behavior will be between you and your daughter - an expression <br/>
of trust, of your respecting her expression of her moment.  In that <br/>
moment that your daughter is expressing her strong will in a way that <br/>
*you* may think is not OK, is for her a very real, very ok, very <br/>
appropriate expression of her experience of that very moment.  A 5 <br/>
year old lives in the moment - our unschooled kids are allowed to be <br/>
in the moment. And we can not be afriad of their moments or <br/>
judgemental of their expressions of their moments.<br/>
<br/>
Gosh - i feel like i must sound so very didactic.   But i know your <br/>
daughter Leia and i&#39;ve never witnessed her doing anything that is not <br/>
*OK* or appropriate to her experience.  I *have* witnessed *your* <br/>
discomfort with her full expression of her moment.  Oh - dear Janna - <br/>
now i hope that i am not coming across to critical of you - but that <br/>
you can hear what i am saying.  I hope that i know you well enough <br/>
that i trust you have the ability to look at yourself in this <br/>
situation.  <br/>
<br/>
When i am uncomfortable with anything either of my daughters do, it <br/>
is time to look at myself.  Because the issue always seems to lie <br/>
within myself and where i am needing to stretch myself.  <br/>
<br/>
We cannot control another person - but we can choose to change our <br/>
response to them.<br/>
<br/>
Wishing you well - always.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Punishment says to the child either:<br/>
<br/>
1) You know better and are deliberately, maliciously choosing to do  <br/>
wrong and I need to punish that evil out of you.<br/>
<br/>
2) You&#39;ve been told the right way and are just not paying attention.  <br/>
You need to be punished so you&#39;ll listen to me.<br/>
<br/>
Assume she&#39;s doing the best she can with her knowledge, skills and  <br/>
level of development. What she needs is your *help* to do better. She  <br/>
may need more help and patience than you believe she needs, but how  <br/>
many times in your life have you told yourself you only need one  <br/>
cookie and then reached for another (or whatever your personal  <br/>
weakness is)? And you&#39;ve had how many years on this planet?<br/>
<br/>
Knowing not to do something isn&#39;t the same as being able to not do it  <br/>
or to do something else instead. She gets a build up of anger and she  <br/>
really doesn&#39;t know what to do to make it feel better. And what  <br/>
you&#39;re giving her is a block to feeling better. Help her find  <br/>
something better.<br/>
<br/>
*But*, while we can&#39;t make life perfectly not frustrating for kids  <br/>
(nor should we try), a lot of mindful parenting is about being aware  <br/>
of our kids and helping them *before* they get to the point of break  <br/>
down. Rather than being their life director, be their partner,  <br/>
helping them get what they want. (Your needs get worked in there too,  <br/>
but they need to see you putting their needs as a top priority before  <br/>
they can accept that you&#39;re trying to help them not thwart them.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My daughter is 5 and very much her own person and strong willed.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If she truly is strong willed and not just a normal 5 yo who has  <br/>
different ideas from you and not afraid to stand up for them (which  <br/>
is perfectly admirable in adults but squashed in children because it  <br/>
makes them inconvenient) you might find help in:<br/>
