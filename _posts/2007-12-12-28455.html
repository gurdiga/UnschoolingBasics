<div id="ygrps-yiv-2105510443">We pulled my autistic son out of public school 3 years<br/>
ago after kindergarten. The stress was too much for<br/>
him... the bright lights, noise, activities, etc. In<br/>
that time, I have become more and more to embrace the<br/>
idea of unschooling. My son is comprehension delayed,<br/>
and so everything he picks up is by memorization. It&#39;s<br/>
rough going, but I feel this was the best thing for<br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
My husband didn&#39;t care that I pulled our son out of<br/>
school. He has refused to have any part of his<br/>
homeschooling.... citing that it was my decision to<br/>
homeschooling, so I should take this on as my<br/>
responsibility. It&#39;s his job to work and make money,<br/>
so he doesn&#39;t have time to do anything with our son.<br/>
But like a backseat driver, he has had comments all<br/>
the way. I&#39;m not doing things right. I&#39;m not concerned<br/>
with what to do with Scot. I&#39;m not keeping track of<br/>
what he should be learning. I&#39;m not teaching him<br/>
everything that he needs to know. I&#39;m not using a<br/>
curriculum. I&#39;m taking too long to teach Scot the<br/>
basics. Today he just hit me with &quot;Maybe we need to<br/>
put him back in school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When I got very defensive about it, he began to yell<br/>
at me that &quot;it&#39;s not all about me.&quot; I cannot treat<br/>
Scot like he&#39;s mine to do with as I please, and not<br/>
have to worry about talking about what I&#39;m doing with<br/>
anyone else. Apparently, I;m only concerned about<br/>
myself, and I need to stop and consider what&#39;s in<br/>
Scot&#39;s best interest.<br/>
<br/>
I know this is part vent, but I also need some help<br/>
here. I tried to explain that it&#39;s not about what<br/>
grade our son is in, and that that should dictate what<br/>
he&#39;s learning. I don&#39;t ned to use that as a guideline<br/>
to worry about what Scot should be learning. Scot did<br/>
horribly in school... and it ended up his aide was<br/>
doing his work for him, instead of helping him to<br/>
understand it. I will not see him put back into any<br/>
school... regular or some special school for autistic<br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
But I need to get my husband to see things as I do. I<br/>
suggested getting some unschooling books, to which I<br/>
was told, &quot;Go ahead and use your money&quot; (I am given a<br/>
certain amount of money each week to buy groceries,<br/>
gas, etc.... and it&#39;s not nearly as much as I actually<br/>
need. but I won&#39;t get into that). It just frustrates<br/>
me that while he insists that he&#39;s only concerned for<br/>
our son, he refuses to have a part in anything<br/>
homeschooling related. All he wants to do is sit back<br/>
and complain about everything he perceives I&#39;m not doing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-989173061">Perhaps, at a moment when you are both calm, ask your husband which he<br/>
would prefer -- to be involved in the homeschooling process or not. <br/>
If not -- then he has, essentially, given up his right to complain<br/>
about the details of how and what.  Explain to him that you feel that,<br/>
if he is unhappy with those details, he is FREE to participate.  But<br/>
to just dump on you because he has a different opinion is neither<br/>
helpful to the development of your son, nor to the health of your<br/>
relationship with him.  Let him know that you want to have growth in<br/>
both areas, that you value him, but that the way he seems to be trying<br/>
to contribute makes you feel (insert your own feelings, stated in a<br/>
way that won&#39;t put him on the defensive.)<br/>
<br/>
Has he done any research on homeschooling?  On the benefits,<br/>
particularly for a child who, like your son, was overwhelmed by the<br/>
physical environment of a ps?  If not, perhaps he needs to learn a bit<br/>
more, so he can understand what is going on.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure others will have other ideas, but that is where I might try<br/>
to start from.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1122131307">That&#39;s part of it. I have been asking him on occasion<br/>
to get involved from the very beginning. At first, he<br/>
rejected all my ideas and said he couldn&#39;t think of<br/>
anything that he could do with Scot. Now he tells me<br/>
that it&#39;s all my responsibility, since his<br/>
responsibility is to make money.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll try your suggestions. I don&#39;t know that they&#39;ll<br/>
work (his logic seems skewed to me), but I will at<br/>
least try.<br/>
