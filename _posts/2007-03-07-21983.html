<div id="ygrps-yiv-1201050818">Hi, all,<br/>
<br/>
My 16-yr-old son is suddenly interested in DNA, genes, heredity. Can <br/>
anyone recommend some good books that are interesting, not dry?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-790313916">We just got a great book through the library called Darwin for Beginners. it&#39;s a graphic novel, <br/>
and maybe more about Darwin than actual genetics. But talk about not dry!<br/>
<br/>
We also have on our shelves, The Selfish Gene, which I thought was a pretty good read about <br/>
genetics. <br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t tell you where to find them, and I don&#39;t remember the authors, sorry.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1220667277">Genome by Matt Ridley is a good book on genetics that isn&#39;t too dry. Matt<br/>
Ridley is a very witty science writer. Steve Jones, a geneticist, has two<br/>
books on genes. One, called Y: The Descent of Men, David&#39;s read it, but<br/>
can&#39;t remember it. Natalie Angier, who is a science writer for the New York<br/>
Times, wrote a book called Woman: An Intimate Geography, which covers alot<br/>
of the genetic difference between men an women. Melissa recommended Richard<br/>
Dawkins&#39; book The Selfish Gene, which isn&#39;t so much about DNA as it is about<br/>
selection working at the genetic level instead of at the level of the<br/>
individual. Larry Gonick&#39;s Cartoon Guide to Genetics might be good.<br/>
Actually, looking through amazon.com, Matt Ridley has done a lot on<br/>
genetics, even a biography of Francis Crick. You might want to see if the<br/>
library has any of his books and see if his writing appeals to your son. I<br/>
love Matt Ridley&#39;s writing. I can&#39;t read Dawkins, though, so I recognize<br/>
that writing style is everything for me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1804452960">Maybe check out &quot;A Cartoon Guide to Genetics&quot; by Larry Gonick.  We haven&#39;t <br/>
read this yet, but my 12 y.o. has read some of Gonick&#39;s other Cartoon Guides <br/>
(history of the Universe, etc.), and he loves them.  They are very <br/>
educational, and fun to read because it&#39;s in cartoon format.<br/>
<br/>
