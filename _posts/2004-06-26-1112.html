<div id="ygrps-yiv-1421213688">Hello,<br/>
I&#39;m a Mom to eight children and only my oldest went to school for k- half of <br/>
1st, the rest have always been &quot;schooled at home&quot; with many controls.  I&#39;m <br/>
looking for some unschoolingbasics and wondering what you all thought about how <br/>
it would be done with a large family.  Our oldest just turned 16 g, 14b, 12b, <br/>
10b, 8g, 6g, 4, and 9mos. b.  How would a mom deal with 8  children in many <br/>
different rooms doing many different things without control????  Right now the <br/>
boys just want to play nintendo and xbox all day long.  16g on the phone <br/>
constantly and 4, 6, 8 yo&#39;s wanting to be in the pool all day.  I do need to get some <br/>
things done other wise chaos.  I just want to understand if it is possible <br/>
with large families.<br/>
