<div id="ygrps-yiv-727425214">Some were pondering how to know when you&#39;ve crossed the line in things like<br/>
cleaning your kids&#39; rooms for them, from being appreciated to being taken<br/>
for granted. I had to share this story of our son, then 2 years old, and how<br/>
he was very clear about that line when it came to diapers/toilet time.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
One day I was changing his diaper and he looked up at me and explained the<br/>
ways of the Universe to me. &quot;I pee, you clean me up; I poop, you clean me<br/>
up! As this was not a role I planned on fulfilling forever, and since I<br/>
figured if his reasoning worked this well, it was time to try it without<br/>
diapers! (He transitioned to the toilet in two days!)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know about all kids, but mine is pretty direct about telling me<br/>
where he&#39;s at!<br/>
