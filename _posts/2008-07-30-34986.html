Sounds like you are searching for the words to give to your mom so that she will support you.  Us Moms---we&#39;re so powerful.  I want my 3 DC&#39;s to approve of themselves.  I want to give myself the same gift.  I love unschooling b/c I am finally approving of myself little by little.  It actually sounds like you know what to do re: your ds.  But re: your Mom---when you give her your reasons, their will be yet another &quot;issue&quot; that she will have.  <br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m curious, are you having,&quot;flashes of doubt&quot; b/c you believe her?  Or are you naturally seeking your sweet and loving Mom&#39;s approval.  That if you can coerce her to agree with you, then you will have her approval in how you &quot;raise you son.&quot;  I still do and mine&#39;s dead for crying out loud!!  How might your DS benefit from your trust in his ability to make decisions for himself?  He doesn&#39;t need your approval to have his choices be good ones, right?  <br/>
<br/>
Regret is a funny thing.  A waste of time IMHO.  None of us could possibly figure out what our children will come to regret if they regret at all.  My DC&#39;s may grow to say, &quot;Mom, we wish you had MADE us stick with blah, blah, blah.&quot; Or it could easily be the other way around.  SO, since I can&#39;t possibly know, I have to follow my own heart.  ENter: RU.  Trust the individual.  Control No One.  <br/>
<br/>
BTW, you can tell your Mom she did a great job!  Look how wonderful you are!  And that your relationship with your DS is based on what most resonates with you and not her.  <br/>
<br/>
Peace, <br/>
<br/>
