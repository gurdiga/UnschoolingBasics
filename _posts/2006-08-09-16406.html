I also  saw an article about a long-term study done on a large number<br/>
of children  about television viewing. The only thing they proved was<br/>
that tv does NOT  cause ADHD (duh) nor does it affect ADD or ADHD kids<br/>
negatively, but there  was a correlation with more tv viewing and<br/>
higher test scores. Go figure.  <br/>

Thanks, Ren.  My kids love TV and I feel like they learn so much from  it!  <br/>
Mine would be diagnosed ADHD, and every thing I read says to  keep ADHD kids <br/>
away from the TV.  I must admit I had a little  mommy guilt about it.  So thanks <br/>
again for posting this!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a misnomer because there is no way to diagnose ADHD.  :)  ADHD<br/>
is categorized by a list of (ever evoloving) character traits.  There<br/>
is no test for ADHD like there is for cancer or a bacterial infection<br/>
or lupus.  And there are different criteria depending on who you talk<br/>
to.  Some people label any child who is fidgety ADHD while another<br/>
person would not label someone else ADHD unless they had 15 or 20<br/>
traits from a list.  Plus things like interest, ability, and<br/>
development are NOT taken into account when looking at ADD/ADHD.<br/>
Really stupid IMO.  Isn&#39;t it nice that we can let our children be who<br/>
they are without those labels and safeguard them from applying those<br/>
labels to themselves?  :)<br/>
