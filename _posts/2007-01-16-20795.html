<div id="ygrps-yiv-302565107">Danielle is now totally frustrated, the installation is stuck on the <br/>
3rd disc, she&#39;s tried several times and it just stops and says it&#39;s not <br/>
responding.   My dh is the computer person but is unavailable at <br/>
work.   It&#39;s probably something that he&#39;ll have to be here for, so <br/>
we&#39;ll just have to wait, but I thought I&#39;d ask.  Her friends on WOW all <br/>
so far said the install was pretty easy.  I hope we don&#39;t have a bad <br/>
disc (arrrggghhh!).<br/>
Thanks<br/>

Crisis averted!  She was hitting &quot;OK&quot; after she put each disc in, so <br/>
she started over and just let it go on by itself!   Some of her friends <br/>
on her guild helped her out!  Thought you&#39;d like to know in case <br/>
someone else was having the same problem!<br/>

itself.  Once i got XP back on my computer it was  fine<br/>
