<div id="ygrps-yiv-1380064077">As a nanny in my pre-parenting days, I picked up<br/>
Sears&#39; The Discipline Book, and that was my<br/>
introduction to the concept that discipline was more<br/>
than a way of dealing with &quot;undesired behaviors&quot;. <br/>
Although I do not agree with everything in the book,<br/>
it was a good intro to attachment parenting for me<br/>
(aside from my instincts).  And, I believe it does<br/>
have a chapter on why you should not spank.  (Of<br/>
course I would never spank someone else&#39;s child!) <br/>
When I was pregnant with our first child and I<br/>
mentioned how we should never spank, I was horrified<br/>
to hear my partner disagreeing with me for after all,<br/>
that was how he was raised!  Well, yeah, so was I!  My<br/>
grandmother would smack us with a fly swatter or<br/>
wooden spoon, sometimes for , really, no reason.  My<br/>
memory of kindergarten (in public school of course)<br/>
was being spanked on my butt in front of the class by<br/>
my teacher with a ruler, for what?  Tapping my pencil<br/>
on my workbook- and not stopping when she told me too.<br/>
 *Alas* perhaps the origins of my anti-authoritarian<br/>
mindset.  I also have a clear memory of being spanked<br/>
by my now EX-stepfather.  He also smacked me across<br/>
the head once for &quot;telling him how to discipline his<br/>
children&quot; (my two half sisters).  Btw, we are not in<br/>
contact now.  I NEVER intended to spank my children<br/>
and was relieved when my partner came around after<br/>
talking to his psychology professor who recommended a<br/>
parenting book to him.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately,  I have lashed out and smacked/spanked<br/>
my first son about three times on his butt or thigh. <br/>
This was because I was stressed out, no patience left,<br/>
angry because I was not in control etc.  Let me tell<br/>
you, this DID NOT feel good.  I instantly felt guilty,<br/>
sad, cried etc.  Needless to say, my son was hurt<br/>
physically and emotionally.  What *was* his mom doing?<br/>
 It truly hurt his feelings.  It can take a lot to<br/>
control these feelings of wanting to spank your child.<br/>
 But those feelings do need to be harnessed.  There<br/>
are tender ways to address challenging behaviors, and<br/>
parents need to seek them out while processing their<br/>
own feelings of thinking they should spank, or<br/>
harnessing the reflecting, hitting hand.<br/>
<br/>
Aside from dialoging, and trying to deal with<br/>
behaviors through words, we have tried time outs.  We<br/>
tried giving our son a few time outs (and these were<br/>
usually for behaviors that were unsafe like repeatedly<br/>
throwing a toy at a person), then we switched to<br/>
giving the item a time out- the toy, not the person. <br/>
Quite a few of my friends are not into time-outs/other<br/>
punishments, so we have tried to be open minded about<br/>
that approach, and really haven&#39;t felt the need to<br/>
give too many time-outs at all.  It may have been on<br/>
this list (but perhaps another) that a woman did not<br/>
give time-outs, but gave time to think, thinking time.<br/>
 So, I have tried this a couple times lately when our<br/>
older son hasn&#39;t been gentle (but too rough!) with our<br/>
one year old.  This worked ok as he likes Blues Clues<br/>
and knows about the &quot;thinking chair&quot; and can grok what<br/>
it means to think about something (he&#39;s not yet 3<br/>
btw).  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read Althea Solter&#39;s the Aware Baby and got some<br/>
good insights from there.  I know there are other<br/>
sources out there, that I just have not gotton to. <br/>
Fortunately we don&#39;t have too many challenging<br/>
behaviors.  Alot, I guess is because we try to give<br/>
our sons the most freedom as possible and only<br/>
intervene when an action verges on not being safe, or<br/>
rude, bad manners-like sharing is a good example.  As<br/>
far as sharing, I went through a phase were I just let<br/>
the kids work it out themselves, and now, say that<br/>
they need to share OR take turns.  (Alot of your<br/>
children may be beyond this.)<br/>
<br/>
My current realization is that I raise my voice or<br/>
yell more than I would like!  Again, it is all me, and<br/>
I need to be more aware of how I communicate.  At<br/>
least for me, when I am stressed out (keep in mind I<br/>
have two children under three!) I KNOW I need to chill<br/>
out, because there really are so many damaging affects<br/>
on the child, and then that becomes a part of them,<br/>
and really, I just want the cycle of *violence* to<br/>
end.<br/>
<br/>
While browsing parenting yahoogroups on the web, I was<br/>
appalled to see how many spanking discussion groups<br/>
there were!  Whoa!  Lots and lots of &quot;I believe<br/>
spanking is the way and don&#39;t tell me not to!&quot; groups.<br/>
 Only a couple anti-spanking groups.  One or two<br/>
spanking debates groups.  Quite a few groups of people<br/>
who were spanked discussing their experiences.  And,<br/>
grossly enough, quite a few that seemed pornographic. <br/>
Like, descriptions, pictures and videos of girls being<br/>
spanked.  *GEEZ* This is really gross.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I don&#39;t know how this got so long, I guess<br/>
really I just needed to admit all of the above and say<br/>
that I truly am against spanking and support anyone<br/>
who is trying to stop and am happy to stand up against<br/>
anyone who is currently spanking, because it really is<br/>
violence against a helpless child.<br/>

**Did you come across Pam S.&#39;s group? Here&#39;s the description:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The primary purpose of the NoMoreSpanking list is support for parents who<br/>
wish to discover and utilize alternatives to spanking their children. This<br/>
list is not for debating, but is for providing help, information, ideas, and<br/>
encouragement primarily for those who prefer not to use corporal punishment<br/>
on their children.<br/>
<br/>
The official point of view of this list is that punishment may control a<br/>
specific behavior but that it unnecessarily interferes with the long-term<br/>
goal of promoting self-control and that alternative nonpunitive ways of<br/>
relating to children are preferred. Punishment includes hitting, spanking,<br/>
swatting, shaming, ridiculing, threatening, using harsh or cruel words,<br/>
penalizing, holding back rewards, or other methods that assert adult power<br/>
or vent adult frustration. We are seeking alternative approaches that<br/>
provide guidance to our children that will encourage self-control, thinking<br/>
before acting, learning to take responsibility for their own behavior, and<br/>
especially that will promote a lifelong warm, close, and open relationship<br/>
between parent and child.<br/>
<br/>
Questions and suggestions and support are welcome from parents, no matter<br/>
what their parenting philosophies or practices, but this is not the place<br/>
for argumentative posts, particularly those that justify spanking. &quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-382957052">Violence damages trust. You know that, now you can choose another <br/>
path. Choose connectivity and harmony and joy. It is simple yet <br/>
difficult if you never experienced trust yourself. You have to learn <br/>
to trust yourself. I know that has been hard for me, and still is <br/>
because of external controls for so many years. I am working hard to <br/>
follow a different path. I have learned about myself and my hot <br/>
buttons. It keeps getting easier. <br/>
