<div id="ygrps-yiv-1946049659">I don&#39;t know what to do and need help.<br/>
<br/>
My 15yo dd who previously was with us only on weekends moved in full <br/>
time :) and now 5yo dd is really acting up. 5yo has told me that I <br/>
have to promise only to pay attention to her or she will hit me, live <br/>
somewhere else, bite me and mor I can&#39;t remember right now. I have <br/>
tried to amke sure both 15yo and 5yo have their needs met but it is <br/>
tough. 15yo is going through emotional termoil with the change and <br/>
leaving her dad, 5yo seems jealous.<br/>
<br/>
I have spent most of everyday with 5yo watching movies with her, <br/>
snuggling, going to park, playing etc. but she still clings on to me <br/>
so tightly when 15yo or DH is home. She wants me to carry her which <br/>
would be fine with me but she really is too big for me to carry all <br/>
the time, I give her piggybacks and shoulder rides when I can. I have <br/>
tried to validate her feelings and reassure her that I will still <br/>
take care of her.  She has even starting nursing again. <br/>
<br/>
Last night 5yo said that she new she was not a good person that she <br/>
hated herself and she wanted wings so she could fly up to the sky and <br/>
be with her grandma. She has hit,kicked, bit, said I hate you. These <br/>
are things that she would not have heard or gotten from our home. I <br/>
try my best to stay calm during these meltdowns and eventually she <br/>
will cry and say she is sorry. <br/>
<br/>
This change is hard for both girls and also for DH and I. What can I <br/>
do or say to help the girls feel secure that there is enough of me to <br/>
go around. How do I keep 5yo from overshadowing 15yo (from experience <br/>
I know that 5yo personality is to keep pushing and 15yo has not <br/>
learned how to ask for or get what she needs) when it comes to time <br/>
with me. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1632408763">I think it&#39;s good to keep doing what you are doing, reassuring her, <br/>
giving her attention, but have you told her how *you* feel about <br/>
what she&#39;s saying or doing? When we first began our Unschooling <br/>
journey, I was so all about meeting their needs and making sure <br/>
their feelings were acknowledged and validated, I forgot that I had <br/>
feelings and needs, and that those were *just as* important as the <br/>
children&#39;s feelings, and I still forget, sometimes. <br/>
<br/>
My oldest, 8yo ds, is here full time, and 4yo ds is gone on <br/>
weekends, at which time 8yo and I have a thoroughly &quot;us&quot; two days. <br/>
It&#39;s really hard for him to switch gears, and he will say things <br/>
like &quot;I hate you&quot; to 4yo. At which time, I confront him immediately, <br/>
calmly, and tell him, &quot; that really hurts my feelings, Solly. Are <br/>
there other words you can use to tell Ryan how you feel? I <br/>
understand that you are frustrated, right? But I love you, and I <br/>
love Ryan, and it hurts my heart when someone says something mean to <br/>
you.&quot; At which time he starts to explain, and we solve the problem, <br/>
with Ryan jumping in &quot;yeah, Solly, that makes me sad&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My kids have lots of frustrated behaviors that I am appalled at <br/>
also. I&#39;ve stopped worrying about where they &quot;get them&quot; from, <br/>
because I think every human has the potential to be violent and <br/>
dangerous when they&#39;re angry. I think of it as kind of like free <br/>
form anger, it&#39;s just not nearly as pleasant to watch as, say, free <br/>
form dancing. <br/>
<br/>
I know there&#39;re lots of other facets to your situation I&#39;m not even <br/>
touching on, but I think it&#39;s vitally important to let kids know, <br/>
especially when they are being  violently expressive of their <br/>
frustrations, exactly how it makes you feel, and then sit right <br/>
there with them, without even saying anything or asking any <br/>
questions, just watch her, let her feel that you are there with her <br/>
in this, and let her make the first move. Hopefully, she will see <br/>
that you *are* there, right now, but the communication can&#39;t happen <br/>
until she is not abusing you. I don&#39;t mean to say that you should <br/>
withhold, just let her really have control of the situation. I think <br/>
she is feeling really out of control, and she&#39;s showing you &quot;look <br/>
how crazy I feel right now!&quot; Maybe she just needs to come to her own <br/>
conclusion that she can express how she feels without hurting you, <br/>
in a different way, and that she will be heard, that you will be <br/>
there. <br/>

This contradicts what you said in your very first post here, about CPS<br/>
being involved in your lives because you hit a teen in your home. It<br/>
will be hard to offer helpful advice if we&#39;re not getting an accurate<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It will help if you see that you don&#39;t *need* to clean up. And before  <br/>
you say -- &quot;Yes, I do! It&#39;s not me being a neat freak ...&quot; --- ;-)  <br/>
recognize that it&#39;s something you *want* to do. Really, really want  <br/>
to but one will die if you don&#39;t clean up. It&#39;s something that will  <br/>
ease something in you so you *want* to do it.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s too young to understand. I suspect you&#39;re trying to get her to  <br/>
understand in order to get her okay so you can stop from feeling  <br/>
guilty for saying, &quot;No, I can&#39;t play right now.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t need her permission on how you spend your time. You *can*  <br/>
say, &quot;I&#39;m setting a timer for 15 minutes to do a quick clean up.&quot; You  <br/>
*can* say &quot;Here&#39;s what I&#39;d like to do for the afternoon ... (which  <br/>
includes some clean up and some fun things :-) What would you like to  <br/>
do?&quot; And then work out a plan to get both of your wants worked in.<br/>
<br/>
I want to add a caveat to the &quot;You don&#39;t need her permission on how  <br/>
you spend your time.&quot; You *can* spend your time however you want. You  <br/>
get to choose. :-) But if you choose in a way that her wants and  <br/>
needs keep slipping down the list as more &quot;have tos&quot; (or your own  <br/>
want tos) get added to the list, that teaches her she needs to fight  <br/>
to get her wants and needs met. She won&#39;t compromise when you say  <br/>
&quot;Hey, I need to do this!&quot; because she knows once your attention  <br/>
shifts away, she&#39;s very likely lost the opportunity to get what she  <br/>
wants.<br/>
<br/>
Be realistic about your needs. A need for 3 hours of alone time a day  <br/>
just isn&#39;t going to happen with a 5 yo ;-) (I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re  <br/>
doing that. It&#39;s just an extreme example. We should carve out time to  <br/>
meet our needs, but we need to be reasonable about what we can and  <br/>
can&#39;t achieve when we have kids. We brought them into our world and  <br/>
they *are* our priority until they&#39;re gone.)<br/>
<br/>
Put her on your list and make sure you treat her needs as important  <br/>
as a friend&#39;s needs. But also treat your needs and your husband&#39;s and  <br/>
your son&#39;s as you would a friend&#39;s. Be realistic! Don&#39;t whine and  <br/>
complain (silently) that you&#39;re only one person and they should just  <br/>
understand and not ask more than you can do so you don&#39;t have to feel  <br/>
guilty or overworked. Ask for help. You can say &quot;I&#39;d like to make  <br/>
dinner *and* play with you. If you help me with dinner, it can go  <br/>
faster ... We can play restaurant and make dinner together ...&quot; Or  <br/>
see if she can come up with ideas.<br/>
<br/>
If you have some specific examples, it might be easier to explain  <br/>
since that maybe sounds too pie in the sky ;-)<br/>

It was such a relief to all of us when Ray&#39;s mom finally said okay <br/>
to homeschooling. School was a big disruption to our life! So if <br/>
your older dd is in school, that may be adding some extra stess for <br/>
your 5yo in some different ways... she could worry that she&#39;ll get <br/>
sent to school, too, for example. That would certainly account for <br/>
the clinging and &quot;acting up&quot;. Even if she&#39;s not worried about <br/>
something like that, having a new housemate is a BIG life change - <br/>
having one with these weird scheduling, clothing, food, and work <br/>
requirements is a big topsy-turvey change. *I* felt like school was <br/>
ruining our life - your 5yo could easily feel the same way.<br/>

helps him feel important and special even with a high-energy 5yo <br/>

<br/>
Honestly, though, if the 15yo is in school, her needs may be <br/>
overshadowed just as a result of that. Certainly it will be faaaaaar <br/>
more difficult to include her in your Real life if she&#39;s not <br/>
unschooling, too. <br/>

&gt; Rachel, can you clarify that last bit for me... what do you <br/>

&gt; is that correct?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes she goes to school, the same one since kindergarten and is not<br/>
wanting to leave right now. We are looking into other options and what<br/>
she feels comfortable with. She is only beginning to realizes that she<br/>
can choose and her choices will be honored. <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I would be relieved if 15yo decided to unschool but I don&#39;t want her<br/>
to feel like now *I* am *telling* her to quit school. I have to allow<br/>
her to truly chose for herself, that is soooo hard for me.  I think<br/>
this new experience with living here and having so much<br/>
freedom...phone, friends, computer, My Space, ears pieced, food<br/>
choices, clothing *she* likes, etc., will help her see that she can be<br/>
herself and be loved, not valued by her GPA.<br/>
    It also makes sense that 5yo would be scared of being sent to<br/>
school.  She doesn&#39;t like to be away from me for very long. Dh and I<br/>
have tried to have a date night where 5yo spends the night at grandmas<br/>
(5yo&#39;s idea) but I have picked her up 2 out of 3 times :) and the 3rd<br/>
time I picked her up really early in the morning, and 5yo and her<br/>
grandma have a very close relationship.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, we have had to deal with lots of homework and why can&#39;t 15yo<br/>
play now and Parent teacher conferences (I promised 15yo that I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t tell her teachers what I really thought).<br/>

where everyones needs can be met at the same time rather than only one<br/>
person at a time. Things are calming down a bit as time goes on. At<br/>
first 5yo would grab my arm and try to take me away from 15yo and talk<br/>
over 15yo when we were trying to have a conversation.  Last night 5yo<br/>
put some very *lovely* make-up on me while 15yo and I had a great<br/>
talk, all was well.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So glad to hear it! I think that all of us have a tendency to freak <br/>
out a bit about changes, it&#39;s a hard thing to accept, that nothing, <br/>
*nothing* stays the same. I like to talk to my kids about changes on <br/>
a molecular level, the way that every time we drive our car some <br/>
tiny bits of the tire stay on the road, and so even though it&#39;s <br/>
still a tire, it&#39;s different, and the road is different, and when <br/>
you eat food, it makes the cells in your body, and so those cells <br/>
are different, and the cells your sheets make your sheets <br/>
different....<br/>
We like to point out to eachother all the ways every single thing is <br/>
different every moment. And it&#39;s exciting. We went to a mandala <br/>
making by a group of Tibetan Monks last summer, and really got on a <br/>
kick about how wonderful it is that everything changes all the time. <br/>
It&#39;s a really peaceful feeling to just *know* that in your soul. <br/>
Maybe your 5yo would enjoy a table top zen garden? I know I do! <br/>
Happy changing.<br/>
