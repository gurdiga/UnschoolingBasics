<div id="ygrps-yiv-93088440">~&lt;&lt; We do everything together as a group- I don&#39;t take one child at a<br/>
time for a &quot;special outing&quot; or for &quot;boy&#39;s day out&quot; or &quot;girl&#39;s day out&quot;.~<br/>
<br/>
We do.<br/>
I highly recommend outings with children one on one. I don&#39;t call it<br/>
&quot;boy&#39;s day&quot; or anything. It&#39;s just a &quot;date&quot;. Now if there&#39;s a group of<br/>
us, it might be  &quot;girl&#39;s day out&quot;, like when my sister and niece and<br/>
some friends were here. We do things the guys don&#39;t care to<br/>
participate in.<br/>
<br/>
My children get to really shine when they&#39;re one on one with us. I<br/>
believe it&#39;s really helpful, ESPECIALLY in large families to make sure<br/>
the kids get time with a parent when their siblings are doing<br/>
something else. Great stuff.<br/>

also have &quot;Daddy Time&quot; but it is a bit different from &quot;Mommy Time&quot;)<br/>
Mommy Time is usually initiated by the child and it is my clue that I<br/>
have a child that has something that needs working out.  It may not<br/>
happen verbally, but there is something going on that this child needs<br/>
time with just me in order to work something through.  I usually<br/>
notice after one of these Mommy Times some sort of change in the child<br/>
- whether developmentally, physically, comprehensively, emotionally,<br/>
etc.  Sometimes I initiate Mommy Time in little spurts such as &quot;I need<br/>
to run to the store, would you like to join me?&quot;  It&#39;s nothing special<br/>
or grand, just time with mom.<br/>
<br/>
I also highly recommend it!<br/>
