<div id="ygrps-yiv-697628186">This happens to me almost every time I take the kids to the<br/>
playground. My dd is 7 so she is happy playing with other kids, but my<br/>
4 yo still likes to mostly play with mommy.....One day one little girl<br/>
wanted me to swing her, lift her on the monkey bars, get her a drink,<br/>
all the while her mom is off having a conversation with someone  up on<br/>
the ball field, with her back to the playground!!  Suppose someone not<br/>
so honest and friendly came along??  sometimes i think some parents<br/>
need to wake up!<br/>
It does annoy me when i am swinging my ds and some other kid wants me<br/>
to swing him cuz his parent is too busy talking on a cell phone to pay<br/>
any attention.<br/>
I don&#39;t know what the answer is......in the case of the little girl, I<br/>
told her to go get her mommy :)<br/>

&gt; always having to entertain other people&#39;s children. We went to the  <br/>
&gt; park today and I was engaging with Payge. Another girl approached us  <br/>
&gt; and started to play with us. After a few minutes I have some girl who  <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know in competition with MY child for my attention. All the  <br/>
&gt; while her mother is just sitting at a picnic table doing absolutely  <br/>
&gt; nothing. It happens all the time. My dh was playing basketball with  <br/>
&gt; Payge a few weeks ago and another little boy came up and starting  <br/>
&gt; playing with them. Pretty soon my dh who hasn&#39;t seen his kids much  <br/>
&gt; that week because he worked lots of overtime is entertaining someone  <br/>
&gt; else&#39;s child (while his dad sits on his cell phone and talks) and  <br/>
&gt; missing out on time he devoted to our daughter. When were out front  <br/>
&gt; playing with the kids (because it seems were the only parents that  <br/>
&gt; do) all the neighbor kids try join in, and we become the babysitter  <br/>
&gt; for all the parents who could give a lick what their kids are doing,  <br/>
&gt; as long as they aren&#39;t bugging them. I find it incredibly  <br/>
&gt; frustrating. We&#39;ve started to play in our backyard more (though it is  <br/>
&gt; small). Sometimes I&#39;m at the park with my two kids by myself  <br/>
&gt; entertaining a child, when the parent only has that one child to tend  <br/>
&gt; to! Payge wants me to play with her still when we are out. She just  <br/>
&gt; turned four, she&#39;s still very little. So even if she does play with  <br/>
&gt; another kid at the park she needs me near as well. I try not to hover  <br/>
&gt; but to be there if she needs an out and just doesn&#39;t want to play  <br/>
&gt; anymore but can&#39;t express those words, even when it is clear that she  <br/>
&gt; wants to.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Does anyone else have experience with situations such as these? I  <br/>
&gt; truly hope I&#39;m not offending anybody here, but I highly doubt anyone  <br/>
&gt; on this list is the type of parent I&#39;m referring to here. Lots of  <br/>
&gt; times parents at the park are engaged with their children while I  <br/>
&gt; engage with mine and we all help each other tend to the kiddos, but  <br/>
&gt; when I&#39;m running around with a 4 y/o old and a 16 month old I don&#39;t  <br/>
&gt; want to be responsible for entertaining everyone else&#39;s kids simply  <br/>
&gt; because the parents don&#39;t want to do anything. It is not as if the  <br/>
&gt; children don&#39;t want to play with their parents, you can clearly see  <br/>
&gt; them trying to connect but when they aren&#39;t getting connection from  <br/>
&gt; their parents they move on to me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So that is my rant. In the spirit of not just bitching about a  <br/>
&gt; situation but actively seeking to change it have any of you ever  <br/>
&gt; politely told a child (or better yet their parent) that you can&#39;t  <br/>
&gt; play with them? That you have YOUR kids to take care of. Okay, maybe  <br/>
&gt; not as snarky as that but you get my drift. Any advice or ideas? I  <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t want to hurt a child&#39;s feelings. I would hope another adult  <br/>
&gt; would treat my children with consideration. Then again that would be  <br/>
&gt; easy for them to do since my children aren&#39;t clinging to them for  <br/>
&gt; attention, since they are already receiving it from me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I hear how frustrated you are!!  Since we can&#39;t really change other <br/>
folks, I think I would try to shift my perception so this situation <br/>
didn&#39;t frustrate me quite so much.  I love the mother&#39;s milk <br/>
analogy:  It doesn&#39;t matter how much you need to produce, you can <br/>
always produce enough because it&#39;s not like you only manufacture and <br/>
store it and then you run out; you produce the amount that is <br/>
needed.  I believe that love is like that.  And, what you are doing <br/>
when you&#39;re playing with other kids who are being ignored by their <br/>
own folks is a very loving thing to do.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you can find some way to reduce the intensity of frustration <br/>
you feel, you may be able to stop attracting these kinds of <br/>
situations.  I&#39;m reminded of the concept, &quot;What you resist <br/>
persists.&quot;  I could be wrong, but I think if you can find the joy or <br/>
the good in these times and stop having such an emotional charge <br/>
around it, things may resolve for the better all on their own.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s just my opinion; I&#39;d certainly be interested to hear others&#39;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-753256551">I just spent 3 long, hot days at our local fair with 3-5 &quot;loaner&quot; kids. I<br/>
was emotionally spent every single night and on edge for the most of my<br/>
sacred down time... When Super Cool Boyfriend asked me *why* do I do this, I<br/>
burst into tears and remembered all of the amazing grownups who showed me<br/>
great patience and kindness when I was a kid and how it changed my life. *I*<br/>
am so glad to give that opportunity to other kids. The parents will never<br/>
appreciate the time and attention I invest in their kids -- those kids sure<br/>
do and that makes all the difference to me.<br/>
That is not to say I don&#39;t have a bit of a temper tantrum when we go through<br/>
48 cans of coke in two days because no one else&#39;s parents keep it in their<br/>
homes. It&#39;s tough to see all of our food eaten by kid who don&#39;t have free<br/>
rein at home... Then I shift my focus to abundance. There *is* plenty for<br/>
all.<br/>

Does anyone else have experience with situations such as these? I<br/>
truly hope I&#39;m not offending anybody here, but I highly doubt anyone<br/>
on this list is the type of parent I&#39;m referring to here. ~~<br/>
<br/>
I completely and totally understand the frustration, having run into<br/>
it many times. But I&#39;m not as quick to judge a situation now because<br/>
my own life experiences have put me as the parent sitting on the<br/>
sidelines. <br/>
<br/>
After surgery once, the kids really needed to get out of the house. I<br/>
took them up the street to the park to play. I was in NO condition to<br/>
play or pick anyone up. I remember feeling really bad when another<br/>
parent had to lift Jalen off the monkey bars before I could even walk<br/>
to him. In hindsight, we should have just stayed home.<br/>
<br/>
I see a lot of what you&#39;re talking about though. It seems like the<br/>
kids are SO hungry for attention. They latch onto a kind adult<br/>
instantly. I do love kids, but I really want to give my own the time<br/>
and focus they deserve. Sometimes it&#39;s easy to include other children,<br/>
other times it&#39;s not going to work. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know that there is any easy answer. Creating playdates with<br/>
mindful parents helps! Sounds like you have some of that....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1856658100">Last fall, while we were traveling and staying in a little campground in<br/>
Iowa, the boys and I were spending lots of time on the playground.  A few<br/>
other kids showed up, Saylor took off to play with another boy, and I was<br/>
swinging the two littles, when these two *precious* little girls wandered<br/>
over and asked me to swing them, too.  My heart was overflowing with Joy and<br/>
Love at this particular moment, so it was easy to say Yes!<br/>
<br/>
Long story short, we had some great conversations, all the kids took turns<br/>
getting underdogs from me, and we laughed a lot!  The whole time, I didn&#39;t<br/>
see any adult around who was looking after these girls.  Well, the more we<br/>
talked, they started sharing information about how they were there with<br/>
their grandparents, and their mom was at home and I kind of got the feeling<br/>
that their home wasn&#39;t the best place for them to be.<br/>
<br/>
When I needed to take the baby back to the bus for a change, the girls both<br/>
told me they loved me and they wished *I* was their mommy.  The bigger girl,<br/>
probably 9 or so, said she&#39;d go home with me right then and there.  And then<br/>
I said, &quot;well, I would LOVE to take you home, but your mommy would miss you<br/>
so much&quot;  She said, very matter of factly, &quot;no, she wouldn&#39;t.&quot;  Uggh.  I<br/>
wanted to burst into tears on the spot.  I&#39;ll never forget those two girls,<br/>
I *was* that girl way back when.  Now, I see it as a way to heal myself, by<br/>
sharing the Love and offering kindness to children who seek it.  It is about<br/>
focusing on the abundance, that I have enough LOVE for any child that comes<br/>
into my world, if only for a second.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-262625141">Not sure I have a good solution but I feel torn on both sides of this.....<br/>
   <br/>
  When we are out Nate requires 99.9 % of my attention ..its a matter of safety in some cases for himself and in other cases for others like when he suddenly decides to bite hard enough to break skin. <br/>
  During this time my 2 girls dont get the attention they should be getting. So while I am pretty sure no one was talking about me or this type of situation i still feel guilty when my 4 year old merrily starts telling her life story to some other parent at the mcdonalds playground ...or where ever. <br/>
   <br/>
  Like in the OP though I also feel extemely frustrated when Im trying to at least give my kids that bare minimum of yea i see you up there sweetie and my son is trying to go into meltdown mode and Im trying to keep him calm and I have 4 other kids following me around and talking to me. <br/>
   <br/>
  Im not saying you always have to be everyones playmate/ entertainment and I definetly think you should set limits esp in your own front yard. But maybe the parent on the phone is having to make arrangements because their husband went out of town, had an accident and is in the hospital, or maybe the mom that seems really not there today has been up for the last 2 days because her autistic son wont sleep and she is in the tubes with said son, or maybe a little boy who usualy seens his parents get mad/stressed over a situation react by automaticly yelling......maybe he needed a differnt example today ...........maybe :) <br/>

making eye-contact and smiling at *everyone* while teaching yoga and <br/>
working retail, and sort of had to unlearn it. There are times when <br/>
my kid(s) are fine with me hanging out with other kids (or adults) <br/>
and times when one or the other of them really needs my attention <br/>
and support. <br/>
<br/>
For kids coming to your yard... telling them y&#39;all are <br/>
having &quot;family time&quot; might be a gentle way of sending them away. Its <br/>
not a blanket statement that y&#39;all don&#39;t ever want to hang out, just <br/>
not right now. <br/>
<br/>
Try to see yourself as *choosing* to play with others or focus on <br/>
your own kids, so that you can play wholeheartedly.<br/>

I think you should find a way to do both- there is just us time and <br/>
us and others time. How does you child view these times with other <br/>
kids. I would find a place to play that is more isolated and play <br/>
there. Your yard is your space so maybe saying &#39;hey we are having <br/>
family time right now but maybe next time or in a half and hour&#39; or <br/>
something like that. <br/>
<br/>
You are right the parents are irritating not really the children but <br/>
could you say &quot;hey maybe you can go see if your mom will play that <br/>
with you&quot;- is there anything you can do to make play time more one <br/>
on one- sometimes when the playground is full I wll say &quot;hey you <br/>
want to just take a walk?&quot; sometimes she will say yes and then we <br/>
say to others we are taking a walk but wil be back.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1941314474">Yes, I did not mean to sound heartless in my response!  karen your<br/>
post was oh so sweet!<br/>
In the case of the little girl, I knew her mom from town, and also<br/>
from gymnastics.........so it was more a case like Kendrah said of<br/>
expectation and no appreciation. Not even asking &quot;would you mind<br/>
watching out for dd for a few minutes while I walk up to the ball field&quot;<br/>
she just left when she saw her dd with my kids. So thats why I sent<br/>
the little girl off to get mommy after awhile.<br/>
Its tough because its not the kids fault ever that the parent is<br/>
preoccupied. And I try so hard to give the benefit of the doubt, but<br/>
sometimes its hard when the cell phone conversations can be over heard<br/>
at the playground and it&#39;s obvious it&#39;s not a special circumstance<br/>
that is keeping the parent on the phone.<br/>
So its the parents... yes that I get annoyed with for sure!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-169943392">Just offering another perspective here.  When I take my dd to the <br/>
park, she is mostly wanting to go there to find other people to play <br/>
with.  Not because I&#39;m preoccupied or anything - she knows I&#39;ll always <br/>
push her on the swing if she wants.  But if there&#39;s someone else there <br/>
with or without kids, Brenna WILL want to talk to them, ask if they&#39;ll <br/>
play, ask their names and engage them.  She just really really likes <br/>
meeting new people.  She can talk to me anytime! :)<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, I have certainly had times where I wondered where parents were.  <br/>
I used to live in a building where I was always the only parent <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1585349993">&quot;Why are<br/>

<br/>
I have a friend who worked as a very high end florist. She would <br/>
often get hired to decorate rich peoples houses for christmas with <br/>
greenery etc. In addition, she would always be asked to decorate <br/>
their christmas trees with the home owners own ornaments. That way <br/>
the tree would look &#39;just so&#39;.  My friend felt this to be such a <br/>
soulless pursuit. She didn&#39;t mind doing the greenery, but it really <br/>
bothered her to decorate someone else&#39;s christmas tree for pay. To <br/>
her it seemed very decadent, but to me it seemed very sad that they <br/>
were missing out on the ritual of decorating their own tree.<br/>
I feel that many parents don&#39;t enjoy the time they spend with their <br/>
kids. This is very sad for the kids. But I think it is sadder for the <br/>
parents. I was a kid who was not enjoyed, most of the time, and it <br/>
made me feel really bad and had many negative effects on me. But it <br/>
also lead me to consciously choose a different life for myself. I <br/>
enjoy my children tremendously. Everyday with them is a gift that I <br/>
am thankful for (even when I am exhausted :-)).  My mother didn&#39;t <br/>
enjoy the time with her kids and doesn&#39;t enjoy her grandchildren. She <br/>
sees them only a few times a year even though she lives ten minutes <br/>
away. Sometimes I feel bad for my kids that they don&#39;t have a doting <br/>
grandmother. Sometimes I feel bad for myself that I don&#39;t have the <br/>
help of family to look after my three kids. But mostly I feel bad for <br/>
my mother, because she will never know how to connect with any of us <br/>
and will never know that joy. Her experience of parenting was <br/>
primarily resentment. I think that in her way she did the best that <br/>
she could for her kids. I think most parents do. But many don&#39;t see <br/>
that any real connection with their kids is even possible. Many more <br/>
parents just haven&#39;t found the fun in it. For me, it is important to <br/>
feel compassion for these parents AND their kids. I can&#39;t imagine <br/>
anything sadder than not enjoying time spent with your own children.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My kids are this way, too. Going to the playground or the park is<br/>
about meeting and playing with people other than *mom* lol. They&#39;ll<br/>
happily run up to other kids, adults, families, etc. - anyone they<br/>
find interesting that catches their eye. I&#39;ve always thought of these<br/>
places as shared space where people can go for &quot;community time&quot;. It&#39;s<br/>
where my kids go when they want to interact with unfamiliar people.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know, maybe I&#39;m wrong in that thinking... because I&#39;ve never<br/>
thought that when my daughter sits down in the grass beside a mom and<br/>
her toddler that she&#39;s interrupting something. She&#39;s curious, she<br/>
loves babies, she sees an opportunity to meet new people. Of course I<br/>
*will* help her find something else to do and gently lead her away<br/>
from mom & toddler if she seems to be monopolizing their time. And I<br/>
will remind my son that the family quietly playing a game of cards<br/>
under the shade tree would probably prefer to be left alone.<br/>
<br/>
I try to help them navigate the social world at these places - I can<br/>
read body language and facial clues better than they can, so I might<br/>
need to step in and guide one of them to another activity when I see<br/>
the signs that they&#39;ve overstayed their welcome or are getting in the<br/>
way of something the person is trying to do. And I know many people<br/>
won&#39;t just tell a child that they want to be left alone (although I<br/>
think that&#39;s totally okay!). So I try to be present, but I don&#39;t want<br/>
to stand in the way of their need for independent interactions and<br/>
experiences.<br/>
<br/>
A few weeks ago at the playground when ds hit it off with a little boy<br/>
his age. His grandmother was hovering over this poor kid every second<br/>
and giving out a continuous string of commands - &quot;be careful!&quot; and<br/>
&quot;don&#39;t climb that&quot; and &quot;you shouldn&#39;t use those steps&quot;. I wanted to<br/>
say, &quot;He&#39;s at a *playground* for goodness sakes, let him be a kid!!&quot;<br/>
She looked aggravated that my son was hanging out with her grandkid.<br/>
Afterwards I realized she probably felt like I was being a neglectful<br/>
parent by not rushing over to make sure my son didn&#39;t climb that or go<br/>
down those steps, etc. Maybe she even felt like *she* needed to watch<br/>
him because I wasn&#39;t there. I did walk over a few times just to &quot;check<br/>
in&quot; but I knew he was okay and did not need or want me hovering over<br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
I guess that&#39;s different though than parents who totally disappear and<br/>
just assume that strangers will take over the care of their kids. It&#39;s<br/>
a habit for us, each time we go to the playground/park/pool to match<br/>
kids up with parents. There is always at least one kid there alone, no<br/>
adult in sight. Sometimes it&#39;s several siblings, who have no doubt<br/>
been left in charge of each other. Dh and I often wonder where the<br/>
parents are and how they can comfortably leave their (young) kids at<br/>
these places. What if one of them got hurt? What if they wondered off<br/>
and got lost? Last year at the pool a 4 year old fell in the deep end<br/>
right - the lifeguards got her, but the mom was nowhere around. Five<br/>
minutes later they found her mom out in the parking lot, talking to a<br/>
friend.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-299775481">For some reason, I have been thinking about this more today after I <br/>
posted about how my daughter loves to meet new people.  I guess <br/>
because it&#39;s something I&#39;ve wondered about for some time.  Just as <br/>
you said, Susan, most people won&#39;t tell a child that they want to be <br/>
alone.  I am curious about this really.  And the OP feels like she <br/>
has to entertain or babysit other kids.  Why are people not <br/>
comfortable saying no to other people&#39;s children?  <br/>
<br/>
I have pushed many children on the swing, but I have also told some <br/>
kids that, no, I don&#39;t want to push them because my dd wants to go <br/>
really high right now or my dd needs me somewhere else.  Or if <br/>
another child interrupts a conversation, I might tell them that I am <br/>
trying to listen to my child.  <br/>
<br/>
There have been many times when my daughter has started talking to <br/>
an adult, and they look at me like they need to be saved! :)  I&#39;m <br/>
just not sure what this is about.  I may apologize for my child if <br/>
she actually interrupts or does something that hurts another child.  <br/>
But do I need to apologize for her just talking to someone?  I can <br/>
understand if they don&#39;t want to hear about which Pokemon is best <br/>
against an electric type :), but they could just say, &quot;No thanks, <br/>
I&#39;m not interested in Pokemon.&quot;  Why do people not do this?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s especially interesting to see a mom saying no over and over to <br/>
her own child and then look helpless when another child talks to <br/>
her.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1177853127">Kendrah, my posts were not solely in response to yours.  Thoughts <br/>
have a way of going on tangents.  I did not think that the specific <br/>
children you were describing were necessarily like mine in wanting <br/>
to meet new people etc.  But I was wondering about the feeling of <br/>
responsibility or &quot;have to&quot; that you felt.<br/>
<br/>
I do agree that sometimes I will redirect my daughter if she is <br/>
trying to engage someone and they are clearly not interested.  It <br/>
really depends on the situation.  If they are really ignoring her or <br/>
I think they might be rude to her, then I will probably intervene.  <br/>
But I was talking about how a lot of parents look at me like it is <br/>
my job to stop my dd talking to them.  I&#39;m not sure I agree with <br/>
this assumption, and I&#39;m also not sure that it is my duty to avoid <br/>
hurting another child&#39;s feelings by being honest if I don&#39;t want to <br/>
play with them right now or listen to them when I would rather be <br/>
with my own child.  I don&#39;t think other parents should expect me to <br/>
be like a parent to their child when I don&#39;t even know them.  It <br/>
sounded like this is what was annoying to you, so if you don&#39;t think <br/>
other parents should expect this, then why would you expect it of <br/>
yourself or feel like you have to entertain the kids?<br/>
<br/>
Sure, most kids know when they are being rejected.  I am just <br/>
wondering if others here feel like this is always a bad thing.  <br/>
Should we protect our children from other people not being <br/>
interested in them?  <br/>

No, not forever. Since dd is only four, I will continue to try my best <br/>
to. Not<br/>
in a hovering<br/>
way, but if I notice an adult would like to be freed from the <br/>
conversation I<br/>
will help with<br/>
that so it doesn&#39;t have to come to someone telling her they would <br/>
rather not<br/>
hear about<br/>
what she has to say at this time. She&#39;ll have her whole life to <br/>
experience that<br/>
sometimes<br/>
people aren&#39;t  going to be interested in what she has to say. And the <br/>
hurt that<br/>
could<br/>
potentially bring.<br/>
-=-==-=-<br/>
<br/>
Duncan can ....um...&quot;wind up&quot;... sometimes when he gets going. A real <br/>
&quot;walkie-talkie!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It can be embarrassing (for the talker and the listener) to <br/>
hear---right in the midst of a story, while the listener&#39;s eyes glaze <br/>
over---&quot;Duncan, back off---that person&#39;s not interested.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So we worked out a code. When one of us says &quot;Beepbeep&quot; it means to <br/>
stop---the listener is shutting down. We got it from Stephen King&#39;s IT: <br/>
the kids tell one of the characters to &quot;beepbeep&quot; when he gets going <br/>
too much. Duncan tends to get really excited when talking about YuGiOh! <br/>
or a new video game or Bionicle characters---and most folks over the <br/>
age of 60 can only make out one or two common words! The rest is <br/>
practically Greek...or Japanese...or Geek! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Dunc&#39;s also told me &quot;Beepbeep&quot; on more than one occasion! &lt;G&gt; A <br/>
&quot;back-off&quot; code word that can even be whispered, mouthed, or shouted <br/>
 from across the room. It&#39;s never meant in a mean way---just a small <br/>
reminder that his passion may not be shared by his listener and that <br/>
it&#39;s maybe time for a graceful exit.<br/>
<br/>
*Duncan* doesn&#39;t want to be thought of as obnoxious and rambling. And <br/>
we assume his listener wouldn&#39;t want to be thought of as ignoring and <br/>
rude. So far, it&#39;s worked well.<br/>

 To her it seemed very decadent, but to me it seemed very sad that they<br/>
were missing out on the ritual of decorating their own tree.<br/>
I feel that many parents don&#39;t enjoy the time they spend with their<br/>
kids. This is very sad for the kids. But I think it is sadder for the<br/>
parents.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
My husband, Ben, had never decorated a Christmas tree or dyed Easter <br/>
eggs or carved a jack o-lantern before he met me. His mother would do <br/>
all that while the kids were in school: they&#39;d come home, and the house <br/>
would be decorated for Christmas---tree and all. Pumpkins would be <br/>
carved and on the porch.<br/>
<br/>
My family has always bee a bit obsessive with holiday decorating! We <br/>
have special meals for each event and everything! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ben LOVES that we have so many holiday traditions---and we keep adding <br/>
more! &lt;G&gt; He felt so deprived! He really gets into all the build-up and <br/>
famly time!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 But it also lead me to consciously choose a different life for myself.<br/>
<br/>
--=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Ben too---he truly looks forward to it all and makes a big deal about <br/>
all the little family jokes and traditions to follow.<br/>
