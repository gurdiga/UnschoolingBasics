<div id="ygrps-yiv-1611347620">I am learning so much here!! I am new and have  a pretty miserable 16 year old son who is leaving a waldorf school after being there for 12 years. He is tired of &quot;everything organized&quot; and desperately wants to spend time this summer living in the wilderness.   Like My Side of the Mountain, a favorite book of his. I am not comfortable with this idea of him being alone, without many skills to survive, but want to somehow let him have the experience in a way we feel safe about. He does not want structure....or grownups.   Any ideas??<br/>

  You both may need to compromise a bit. Legally he&#39;s too young to be <br/>
&quot;out in the wilderness alone&quot;---you could be cited for some <br/>
neglect/endangerment issues if something happened or if he were <br/>
&#39;caught&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
  Not Back To School Camps---either in Vermont or in Oregon might be a <br/>
possibility. He could meet a bunch of other unschoolers with some of <br/>
the same ideas. Maybe they could brainstorm. Cameron&#39;s been in Kentucky <br/>
this week at a &quot;Gathering&quot; of unschooling NBTSCampers---not an official <br/>
gathering---just a bunch who wanted to get together before camp starts <br/>
this fall. They&#39;re all living in a cabin owned by own of the campers. <br/>
They&#39;re being fairly self-sufficient, I guess. No phone access, so I <br/>
can&#39;t be sure. He&#39;ll be home late tonight, so I&#39;ll get the full scoop <br/>
then.<br/>
<br/>
  Wilderness Ventures, our of Jackson Hole, Wyoming, would be a good <br/>
start too. No &quot;adult-adults&quot;, but some young adults---21-25. Camping <br/>
under the stars, backpacking, rafting, mountain climbing---many <br/>
different options to chose among. It&#39;s pretty organized though!<br/>
<br/>
  Cameron has this wish too. We haven&#39;t yet figured out how to manage it <br/>
in reality. He&#39;s 18 now though, so there&#39;s not the neglect issue to <br/>
worry about any more. Our trip to the Grand Canyon in September may <br/>
spur him to try that route though.<br/>
<br/>
  This is probably not an uncommon desire for young men. It&#39;s just a <br/>
little scary now!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2032105853">Have him watch the great show called &quot;Survivorman&quot;. Its great !!!!!!!!!!Its <br/>
on Natuional greografic or discovery. He will realize he needs to know the <br/>
skills to be able to do it. Then he can do some research on the subject on <br/>
his own and fgure out a way to do it safe.<br/>
It would be a lot of fun and self-steem building to be able to do it. Maybe <br/>
he can do like a weekend first to see if he likes it and go on from that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-844693568">***and desperately wants to spend time this summer living in the<br/>
wilderness.***<br/>
<br/>
First a book recommendation: The Indian Creek Chronicles by Pete Fromm,<br/>
about a young man who spends a winter in the Selway.   He was so naive<br/>
and inexperienced it&#39;s almost unbelievable he survived but it&#39;s a good<br/>
story.   Maybe you could take your son to the Selway on vacation.  You<br/>
can rent the McGruder ranger station which is one of the places from the<br/>
book.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how he could go alone yet, legally but one thought is if you<br/>
rented a forest service cabin and stopped in to see him once a day.   It<br/>
might be against the forest service rental policy so you&#39;d have to deal<br/>
with your moral compass on that one.   Most of the cabins only rent for a<br/>
week at a time but maybe you could convince a couple of friends to rent<br/>
it for consecutive weeks . ( their name on the books, you paying for it) <br/>
 Forest service cabins have available wood and usually some cooking<br/>
utensils etc.    I don&#39;t know where you are and maybe you&#39;re in the wrong<br/>
part of the country for forest service cabin rentals.  Google<br/>
&quot;recreational cabin and lookout rentals.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
My other thought, which would be organized : ( would be field work with a<br/>
university student.   Check with your local university or look online.   <br/>
That can be remote and lonely, depends on the work. <br/>
<br/>
Can one parent rent a cabin for the summer and relocate with him?   Maybe<br/>
it could be within commuting distance to work for mom or dad and he could<br/>
be alone during the days.<br/>
<br/>
Can you go on a long wilderness hiking/camping vacation with him?    If<br/>
only one parent goes it might feel more like a friendship camaraderie<br/>
thing than a parents vacationing with kid thing.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1047435014">Does he want to go for contemplating and appreciating nature, like a naturalist?  This might give him some ideas:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://store.wildernessawareness.org/merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=WAS&Product_Code=P1382&Category_Code=1">http://store.wildernessawareness.org/merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=WAS&Product_Code=P1382&Category_Code=1</a><br/>
<br/>
What skills does he have?  Can he cook on a camp stove?  What&#39;s the fire danger in your area?  Does he have a good sense of direction?  know how to use a map and compass?  If he has these skills something like this may work:  you or another adult camp in a campground and backpack your son a ways into the wilderness and check on him once or twice a day?  When I was on Outward Bound many years ago, each of us stayed alone for 3 days; we built a cairn each morning in a designated spot for the the group leaders to check on.   <br/>
