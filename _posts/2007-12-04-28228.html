<br/>
She says there is lots of chatting going on between kids of different<br/>
ages. She did the e-pal thing for a while but it didn&#39;t really take<br/>
off like she hoped. She told me this is easier because it&#39;s lots of<br/>
kids to talk with instead of one person and everyone can share the<br/>
things they like with everyone else. I think she really likes that<br/>
it&#39;s other unschoolers. She can talk freely about video games and<br/>
Harry Potter, lol. Maybe your daughter would enjoy it, too?<br/>

&gt;   Do you have a daughter that might be interested in<br/>
&gt; having an e-mail pen pal?<br/>
&gt;   My daughter is 10 and would love to meet some<br/>
&gt; other unschool girls to e-mail back and forth with.<br/>
&gt; They don&#39;t have to be the same age. Her closer<br/>
&gt; friends range in age from 7-14.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Let me know!<br/>
