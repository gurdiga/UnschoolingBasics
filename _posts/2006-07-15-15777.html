<div id="ygrps-yiv-954627789">~&gt;i need my own life and they need me to have one.~<br/>
<br/>
I think this is a good topic to address.<br/>
In our family, we all have our own interests that overlap into each<br/>
other&#39;s lives to varying degrees. Dh and I have our work we do for<br/>
money, but again, it&#39;s all part of our family flow. I DO have &quot;my own<br/>
life&quot; and the most important part of that life is my children and husband.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, if a mother is so stressed and focused on what the<br/>
kids are or are not learning, it&#39;s time to find some interests of her<br/>
own....yes.  A parent that is joyfully pursuing an interesting life,<br/>
will naturally draw their children into that life (hopefully) and<br/>
learning will happen effortlessly. <br/>
<br/>
Children NEED to see what passion and interest look like. They need to<br/>
know the best parts of their parents. If unschooling is to unfold in a<br/>
home, I think it&#39;s really important for all members to have interests<br/>
that are shared with all other members in whatever capacity those<br/>
other members want to share in it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-296402580"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;i need my own life and they need me to have one.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with Ren on everyhting she replied and I also agree this is a <br/>
great topic. <br/>
<br/>
When you say you need your own life, what exactly do you mean? Do you <br/>
need more of your own interests OR do you need more time away from your <br/>
family OR do you need more alone time?  <br/>
<br/>
Figure out what you need first. <br/>
<br/>
If you feel that you need more of your own interests, then go for it. <br/>
Start all the things you&#39;ve put off! Start those things you&#39;ve always <br/>
wanted to do! Your kids may even catch your enthuasium and join in! <br/>
I&#39;ve just started herb gardening. It&#39;s something I&#39;ve wanted to do for <br/>
a while and my youngest is enjoying it with me. :-)<br/>
<br/>
If you think you need more time away from your family, figure out ways <br/>
to make that happen. Maybe a monthly lunch with friends? Maybe a class <br/>
at a local college? Maybe late night grocery shopping with a friend? <br/>
<br/>
If alone time is what you need (this is my need), get up earlier (I do <br/>
this) and have time alone. Stay up later than the rest of your family <br/>
and have some time for yourself. Go late night shopping by yourself. <br/>
<br/>
The other side to this is...and I&#39;ve found this to be true is all <br/>
things unschooling), it&#39;s all in how you look at it.<br/>
<br/>
You say you need &quot;your own life&quot;. You do have your own life. You&#39;re not <br/>
sharing someone else&#39;s life. It&#39;s all yours. It doesn&#39;t have to an <br/>
either or type of thing. Either I&#39;m a stay at home mom OR I have my own <br/>
life. I share my life with my family...that&#39;s my life...my own life. I <br/>
have my own interests, just as the rest of my family members do. Like <br/>
Ren said, sometimes they overlap. I try to get time alone when I need <br/>
it, just like the other members of my family. I&#39;m not the only one who <br/>
needs to be in their own head sometimes, know what I mean? <br/>
<br/>
Also remember that your life right now is different than it was in the <br/>
past. Your life right now is different than what it will be in the <br/>
future. Needs change, Lives change. <br/>

<br/>
Yes. And &quot;your own life&quot; (from the OP) included choosing to have<br/>
children apparently. They need to feel that they are wanted, needed<br/>
and appreciated. I get the feeling they aren&#39;t getting that message<br/>
with the stress level in the home. <br/>
<br/>
If there are hassles over homework, restrictions to elicit desirable<br/>
behavior, I think the message being sent is that they are a problem<br/>
and/or causing stress in the parents. The reality is, the parents are<br/>
CHOOSING their own stress. We can make a different choice.<br/>
