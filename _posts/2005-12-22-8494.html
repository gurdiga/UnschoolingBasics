<div id="ygrps-yiv-5079943">&quot;... reddish-brown hair, long and sort of <br/>
curly/frizzy and wild, and always dressed in bohemian-type long, <br/>
swirly skirtsskirts. It was such a distinct picture that I sometimes <br/>
forgot I didn&#39;t really know what you did look like. HA! Was I off!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well....I DID have red hair for two whole days last week.:) It changes regularly. I went to purple and white, now back to a dark blue/bright blue and white. But it&#39;s never been frizzy or curly, though I wish sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
And as to the bohemian skirts.....I do that some, but more often I like trendy, black and sleek clothing accented with bright colors. Jeans are a staple though too.:)<br/>
<br/>
I wish we could post a visual of how we see each other just from the posts, and compare it to the real thing. It&#39;s interesting. I had pictured Anne Ohman being more curvacious, kinda round face, long hair, always smiling and speaking softly, wearing soft clothing.<br/>
NOT!!<br/>
She&#39;s thin and tall with very short hair and talks very differently than how her posts &quot;sounded&quot; to me. That first conference in &#39;03 was rather strange...seeing all the people in real life that I had very different visuals for.<br/>
Joyce Fetteroll was very outspoken and bold in my mind (like her posts) and she&#39;s this very quiet, sweet thing in real life!!<br/>

&gt; My son didn&#39;t read at 8, not at 10 either, now at 12 and a half, he reads for <br/>
&gt; information but not for pleasure at all. He reads cheat code books, yu-gi-oh <br/>
&gt; cards, things like that. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At some point, your son will be in a situation where things will go easier if he <br/>
&gt; reads, then he will become interested. For my son, he simply got tired of <br/>
&gt; waiting for me to have a second to run into the game room to read the <br/>
&gt; playstation screen for him. He started trying to figure it out for himself. By <br/>
&gt; being an older child, it was easier for him. <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Hello and Merry Meet. <br/>
&gt; &gt; My name is Melody, but I go by Mel. I am Mama to an 8 yr old son <br/>
&gt; &gt; and soon to be 5 yr old daughter residing in southern Maine. <br/>
&gt; &gt; This is our second year of homeschooling ... last year we tried <br/>
&gt; &gt; the &quot;sit down and study this&quot; method as this was what my husband <br/>
&gt; &gt; was convinced was homeschooling but after pulling my hair out and <br/>
&gt; &gt; my son not learning a thing we radically went to unschooling for <br/>
&gt; &gt; the second half of the year. We are very happy with our decision <br/>
&gt; &gt; to unschool and I see marked improvements in both my children <br/>
&gt; &gt; since making that decision. <br/>
&gt; &gt; I do still feel very very much as a newbie so I look forward to <br/>
&gt; &gt; sitting back and reading the discussions on list. I am hoping <br/>
&gt; &gt; someone might also have suggestions on how to encourage <br/>
&gt; &gt; phonics/reading for my son ?? I am trying not to force it on him <br/>
&gt; &gt; but he chooses still at 8 yrs of age to not read. This is <br/>
&gt; &gt; difficult for me as I am an avid reader but he honestly has no <br/>
&gt; &gt; interest yet, Heck even Harry Potter and Pokemon his two favorite <br/>
&gt; &gt; characters didn&#39;t intice him into reading :( <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks! <br/>
&gt; &gt; Brightest Blessings, <br/>
&gt; &gt; Mel <br/>

&gt; First of all, Ren: I so enjoy everything you post......your posts seem to <br/>
&gt; clarify everything for me. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have two sons aged 8 and 6. They both LOVE the captain underpants books....and <br/>
&gt; part of it is the toilet humor.......and I did try to explain about Miss <br/>
&gt; Anthropy( so they could get it too) but from the look in their eyes , I did it <br/>
&gt; wrong or it was just way over their heads (for now)......!!!!!!! <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m curious as to whether he likes to be read to...that will make a big <br/>
&gt; difference in <br/>
&gt; approach. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; All of my kids have taught themselves to read, but I say that loosely, we have a <br/>
&gt; big reading <br/>
&gt; environment, we read to all of our kids at bedtime and throughout the day, we go <br/>
&gt; to the <br/>
&gt; library once a week, and at quiet times, they can either lay in bed and sleep or <br/>
&gt; read. Guess <br/>
&gt; what they choose? Quiet time is somthing that must occur for the little ones, <br/>
&gt; what the <br/>
&gt; older ones choose to do is their choice, as long as it&#39;s quiet. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My 8yo with autism could not read phonetically, we taught her with whole <br/>
&gt; language, and <br/>
&gt; then after a while she started to pick up phonetics right when she turned eight. <br/>
&gt; Like you, <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m an avid reader and the thought that one of my kids either couldn&#39;t read or <br/>
&gt; would <br/>
&gt; choose not to broke my heart. Part of it is letting go of some expectations, <br/>
&gt; not every child <br/>
&gt; will enjoy reading. But we did point out to our kids that once you can read, you <br/>
&gt; can learn <br/>
&gt; whatever you want through a book. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Looking back, I taught myself how to read, but my brother Chris despised reading <br/>
&gt; because <br/>
&gt; a) it made no sense in his brain and b) everyone else made it such a big dea <br/>
&gt; that he could <br/>
&gt; not readl. He taught himself to read when he was older through the catalogs and <br/>
&gt; instructions for electronic kits and such. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, long sprawling reply, hopefully it makes some sense. I&#39;m still sleep <br/>
&gt; deprived with <br/>
&gt; a newborn nursling, And welcome, i&#39;m new here myself. Still taking notes and <br/>
&gt; deciding <br/>
&gt; where I fit in ;-) <br/>

&gt; Subject: Natural learning <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I had posted in my intro about my daughter with autism, and how we have a fairly <br/>
&gt; consistent <br/>
&gt; schedule because of her needs, as well as some set table time because the way <br/>
&gt; her brain <br/>
&gt; works she does need to have certain things done for her so she can understand. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; but then I started to think about all the other things that we do, that really <br/>
&gt; make our home a <br/>
&gt; natural learning environment. Because of her deficits, she does not necessarily <br/>
&gt; learn by <br/>
&gt; watching, like many kids do, through example. Most of our education is real <br/>
&gt; world though, <br/>
&gt; and her math is going to the store and buying things, learning how to order at <br/>
&gt; fast food <br/>
&gt; restaurants, how to pay, get change, etc. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In that way parents are facilitators, what are some other ways that parents on <br/>
&gt; this board <br/>
&gt; facilitate education? I just wonder if parents here ever contrive a learning <br/>
&gt; situation. This past <br/>
&gt; week, the kids are interested in chemistry, so I made sure that in our baking <br/>
&gt; we talked about <br/>
&gt; chemical reactions, changed the recipes some to see how more baking soda <br/>
&gt; affected the <br/>
&gt; dough, etc. When we were boiling water we started with ice cubes and talked <br/>
&gt; about changing <br/>
&gt; energy to move through states of matter (josh&#39;s interests right now is chemistry <br/>
&gt; and narnia) <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, I must go, there&#39;s a brawl afoot. Thanks in advance for whatever replies <br/>
&gt; I get. :-) <br/>

&gt; No, she&#39;s not having trouble reading, she&#39;s slowly learning to read <br/>
&gt; as human&#39;s do. If you see her as &quot;having trouble&quot; she&#39;s going to <br/>
&gt; pick up on that and feel as though something is wrong because she <br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t living up to your standard. <br/>
&gt; She&#39;s learning to read. There&#39;s no &quot;trouble&quot; with that. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Help her email friends because it brings her joy, because she loves <br/>
&gt; doing it, not to &quot;teach&quot; her anything. <br/>
&gt; If you can be her scribe, and type while she dictates what to say, <br/>
&gt; that will help her learn more joyfully than if you stand over her <br/>
&gt; and try to get her to learn about reading (I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s <br/>
&gt; what you&#39;re doing, but that&#39;s the image I got when you talked about <br/>
&gt; screening her mail). <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Unschoolers believe that learning is joyful. So we put the joy <br/>
&gt; before the learning, and the learning just unfolds naturally and <br/>
&gt; beautifully. <br/>
&gt; Put joy first, put your relationship first....and if you&#39;re already <br/>
&gt; doing that, then just learn to trust that learning will happen. <br/>

&gt; Ever try learning to ride a bicycle from a book? ASL (American Sign <br/>

&gt; it/use it to learn it. Our (my family&#39;s) best source for that was <br/>
&gt; video and websites that use video clips to demonstrate signs. 100 <br/>
&gt; years ago or so, books were everything and reading was critical to get <br/>
&gt; at that information. Today, it&#39;s not as critical - important in many <br/>
&gt; ways but not as critical. Even the &#39;classics&#39; of literature are now <br/>
&gt; available in cassette and CD forms to listen to - and sometimes <br/>
&gt; hearing it is better than reading it (Shakespeare for example is <br/>

&gt; that he&#39;d match up with patterns he was seeing. We just kept <br/>
&gt; answering questions and reading to him when he wanted, listening to <br/>
&gt; him read when he chose, and getting out of the way when he wanted to <br/>
&gt; read by himself. We&#39;d help out when requested, occasionally point <br/>
&gt; out a word that was &#39;weird&#39;, that is, words that look one way but <br/>
&gt; are pronounced another (to add more pattern bricks to his <br/>

&gt; We don&#39;t contrive learning situations because life is full of them <br/>
&gt; already. If DS -wants- to learn about the properties of baking soda, <br/>
&gt; we get out the baking soda and go to town with it (volcanoes are <br/>
&gt; always fun!). We do talk about things as he asks or when something is <br/>
&gt; interesting *to us*. I&#39;ll mention over dinner something I found out <br/>
&gt; that was of interest. It may be one sentence and away it goes, it may <br/>
&gt; end up being a 20 minute discussion, it may end up leading to <br/>
&gt; excursions, websites, and other things down the road, or it may simply <br/>
&gt; remain one sentence. If we&#39;re baking I might mention that I need to <br/>
&gt; measure the baking soda or baking powder carefully (as opposed to <br/>
&gt; splashing in the vanilla) and why. In a world brimming over with <br/>
&gt; things to explore, we&#39;ve yet to find a need to contrive anything that <br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t come up somehow on it&#39;s own. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Seems to me (just the way I&#39;m &#39;hearing&#39; it) that needing to contrive <br/>
&gt; learning situations has at back of it an expectation of what kids <br/>
&gt; are &#39;supposed to&#39; know, do, be taught. If they&#39;re interested in <br/>
&gt; chemistry, get out the household non-toxics and a book of kitchen <br/>
&gt; table science and set to it - no need to contrive it, they&#39;re already <br/>
&gt; asking for it. If they&#39;re not asking for it, then contriving it will <br/>
&gt; simply go in one ear and out the other because it has no place to <br/>
&gt; latch on to. <br/>

&gt; Perhaps so. But if you bring up a topic they&#39;ve not yet expressed interest in, <br/>
&gt; and then <br/>
&gt; they&#39;re interested, then that&#39;s your &#39;sentence at the table&#39;. Josh never thought <br/>
&gt; that there <br/>
&gt; was a math higher than what he already learned. So when I bring up &quot;the next <br/>
&gt; step&quot;, that&#39;s <br/>
&gt; fairly contrived. Maybe it&#39;s a matter of perception. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I guess still that brick and morter instilled subconscious thought that kids <br/>
&gt; won&#39;t think of it <br/>
&gt; (the next step) on their own. I was having trouble discerning where the kids <br/>
&gt; own <br/>
&gt; curiousity blends in with a parent introducing a new topic. I thought Josh would <br/>
&gt; be <br/>
&gt; interested in chemistry, so I pulled up a website and asked what he thought of <br/>
&gt; it. Is that <br/>
&gt; considered contrived? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, thanks for the feedback, <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot; So when I bring up &quot;the next <br/>
&gt; step&quot;, that&#39;s <br/>
&gt; fairly contrived. Maybe it&#39;s a matter of perception.&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But see, you&#39;re seeing math as &quot;steps&quot;....when it has no <br/>
&gt; natural &quot;steps&quot; at all. If you bring some interesting puzzle or <br/>
&gt; game or brain teaser to his attention, because you think he&#39;ll like <br/>
&gt; it, THAT might be broadening his horizons. <br/>
&gt; But pointing out some linear step, is really being stuck in school- <br/>
&gt; think to me. Math is chess and sudoku and cooking and building and <br/>
&gt; guessing and designing and art and....... <br/>
&gt; Where are the steps for that? In school, we are taught in a linear <br/>
&gt; fashion. You have to learn addition before subtraction, then on to <br/>
&gt; muliplication, blah, blah, blah. Nothing could be more contrived and <br/>
&gt; less natural than that. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For one, they never tell you that addition and subtraction are the <br/>
&gt; same thing (inverse operations is all) and multiplication and <br/>
&gt; division are again, mirrors of one another. I never knew you could <br/>
&gt; simply add to subtract until I was an adult. argh. Linear &quot;teaching&quot; <br/>
&gt; stunts the mind...I want my kids to have no part of that. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s all part of our journey as schooled minds. WE have to see the <br/>
&gt; learning in everything and value it all before unschooling really <br/>
&gt; unfolds well for US.:) Kids get it quite well, if we just stay out <br/>
&gt; of their way. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I DO expose my children to new and different things than if I just <br/>
&gt; waited around for some interest to arise. They don&#39;t even know <br/>
&gt; what&#39;s available out there if we don&#39;t share enough of the world <br/>
&gt; with them. But sharing interesting people, places and events is part <br/>
&gt; of building a LIFE, I don&#39;t do it to try and get them to some <br/>
&gt; illusory &quot;next step&quot; or to cover some &quot;gap&quot; in their learning. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s the difference between contrived and natural to me....I agree <br/>
&gt; with Deb on that. <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thank you everyone for your replies and suggestions ... most of all for the <br/>
&gt; reassurance that all is not lost LOL <br/>
&gt; I will try to answer some of the questions I saw posed to me ... yes, we do read <br/>
&gt; aloud to our children and have since before birth (yes I was one to read to my <br/>
&gt; belly while pregnant and listen to music too). Both my husband and myself are <br/>
&gt; avid readers. We read not only bedtime stories but also the Harry Potter series, <br/>
&gt; the Eragon series, Magic Treehouse, Junie B Jones, Phantom Stallion etc with our <br/>
&gt; children. We actually have a childrens&#39; book collection to rival some small town <br/>
&gt; libraries that is often used and well loved. <br/>
&gt; The suggestion about closed captioning ... thank you! I actually enjoy reading <br/>
&gt; the TV so I do turn on the cc when the children and I happen to be watching TV <br/>
&gt; when Dh isn&#39;t home (it annoys hubby to have the scrolling words so we refrain <br/>
&gt; when he is home). <br/>
&gt; My son loves to have Capt. Underpants read to him and he leafs through the books <br/>
&gt; on his own but still no inkling to try reading them. He actually received the <br/>
&gt; whole series last month for his birthday and was very excited about them. <br/>
&gt; Once again, thank you! I do feel better having read that others have experienced <br/>
&gt; their children not being interested in reading at this age. I was beginning to <br/>
&gt; feel very alone and as if something was wrong. I am still &quot;learning&quot; about <br/>
&gt; unschooling and while I am not as bad as I was last year, LOL, I do find myself <br/>
&gt; questioning if they are actually learning sometimes. <br/>

&gt; all sorts of interconnected patterns that we&#39;ve been trained out of <br/>

&gt; Oh, and that &#39;sentence at the table&#39; is to express something *I* <br/>
&gt; find interesting or intriguing or plain silly, whether or not DH or <br/>

&gt; two but I remember these two LOL): one was that sales of sauerkraut <br/>
&gt; are up because some study or other said that it can fend off bird <br/>
&gt; flu; the other was that Bill Gates&#39; house has a trampoline room. <br/>
&gt; Random interesting to me tidbits. The sauerkraut got a chuckle from <br/>
&gt; DH and nothing from DS. The trampoline room had DS wanting to go <br/>
&gt; visit Bill Gates (and a brief discussion of where Bill Gates got all <br/>
&gt; the money to build it) and discussion of rooms we could have if we <br/>
&gt; had lots of money to build anything we wanted. Simply bringing bits <br/>
&gt; of the outside world into our home - the same as we have music and <br/>
&gt; movies and books and wire and batteries and legos and videogames and <br/>
&gt; recipes and shopping trips and computers and magazines and...it&#39;s <br/>
&gt; all part and parcel of life and we all &#39;snack on&#39; whatever is of <br/>
&gt; interest at the time. <br/>

When I went to the first conference, I was also still very new to the  <br/>
message boards.  I had Kelly and Ren looking exactly like....each  other!  Once I <br/>
got to know Ren&#39;s &quot;voice&quot; a  bit more, she still didn&#39;t  look like she *is* but <br/>
a bit of that bohemian-look to her.<br/>
 <br/>
Most of my internet pals are surprised to find out my age (currently  40).  <br/>
I&#39;ve been told that I &quot;type young&quot;.  Not sure if that&#39;s a good  thing, LOL!<br/>
