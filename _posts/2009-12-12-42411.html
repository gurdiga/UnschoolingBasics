<div id="ygrps-yiv-1634359936">My son Julian Baptista, a grown unschooler, is about to release his first  <br/>
album! You may have seen him play guitar and sing at Live and Learn <br/>
conferences  and Northeast Unschooling Conferences. <br/>
 <br/>
You can hear some of his music at his Myspace: <br/>
_http://www.myspace.com/julianbaptista_ (http://www.myspace.com/julianbaptista)  ,  Then please go and <br/>
visit his web site _www.JulianBaptista.com_ (http://www.JulianBaptista.com)  <br/>
and  order &quot;Lost in the Crowd.&quot; Free shipping on pre-sales, and the album <br/>
will ship  in January. You could also become his fan on Facebook.<br/>
 <br/>
Also, for those in the Greater Boston area, he  will be performing in <br/>
January in his first professional (PAID!!!) featured gig!  We&#39;ll have details <br/>
soon.<br/>
 <br/>
Kathryn Baptista, very excited  mama<br/>
