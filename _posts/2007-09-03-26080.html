<div id="ygrps-yiv-809217188">Hello all,<br/>
Thank you so much for this list!  I&#39;m considering hs&#39;ing my 6 year old son<br/>
(K) who is currently attending 1st grade in public school.  I also have 2<br/>
 older daughters that are in 4th & 6th, but they are fine in public school &<br/>
 don&#39;t want to withdraw... as well as an almost 8 month old son (C).<br/>
<br/>
 My son, however, is another story.  He comes home every day telling us that<br/>
 his teacher is mean & that he has no friends & that people pick on him.  He<br/>
 doesn&#39;t want to go to school in the mornings, he just cries.  He&#39;s the one<br/>
 that brought it up!!!  He asked if I could homeschool him one night last<br/>
 week when we were working on his homework with him.  He said, &quot;It&#39;s almost<br/>
 like you&#39;re homeschooling me.  Mommy, can you homeschool me?&quot;  He&#39;s asked<br/>
 every little bit since.  He came home Tuesday with a big knot on his head<br/>
 where a kid had hit him in the head w/ a digger thing in the sandbox.  I<br/>
 asked him if he went to the nurse & he said he was afraid to ask b/c his<br/>
 teacher is mean. :o(  He had a headache b/c of it.  On Monday, he brought<br/>
 his citizenship card home w/ marks for talking on 2 days.  I thought he was<br/>
 going to bawl when he told me that a boy in his class was being mean to him<br/>
 & he was telling him to leave him alone & got in trouble for talking.<br/>
<br/>
 I&#39;m pretty sure I could get whatever books I&#39;d need used online, I could<br/>
 possibly even trade for them on Diaperswappers.com or Amitymama.com, or<br/>
 other sites like those.  I know that there are other parents in Perry <br/>
County<br/>
 that HS.  I know the girls don&#39;t want to, which is fine w/ me.  They&#39;re<br/>
 older & have activities they don&#39;t want to miss out on (specifically<br/>
 volleyball for the oldest)  the younger one has sooo many friends & I think<br/>
 she needs the interaction with them.  K can still do sports (soccer &<br/>
 t-ball/baseball) & we could start going to church more often so he could <br/>
see<br/>
 kids more, if that were a problem for him.<br/>
<br/>
 He just breaks my heart.  I know I can&#39;t protect him from the big bad world<br/>
 forever, but I really want to try!  At the same time, I know he needs to <br/>
get<br/>
 used to people being jerks.  It just kills me that he is sooo sensitive, <br/>
and<br/>
 compassionate for other people...I told Joe (husband) that I guess I&#39;ll <br/>
have<br/>
 to teach C to be tougher & not care so much for people...I just don&#39;t know<br/>
 what to do.  He&#39;s sooooo smart & learns so quickly.<br/>
<br/>
 I&#39;ve really been soul-searching & reading up on it & the laws about it.<br/>
 He&#39;d only have to be in &quot;school&quot; for 180 days, the same amount as the <br/>
girls.<br/>
 I could follow their calendar.  There are no standardized tests, no set<br/>
 curriculum requirements, basically the dept of education considers home<br/>
 schools &quot;private schools&quot;.  I could do so many things with him that would <br/>
be<br/>
 real-life & educational at the same time.  I know I&#39;ve seen pics in the<br/>
 local paper of hs groups taking field trips, etc.  Things like cooking<br/>
 (addition, fractions) sewing (measuring, cutting, following directions &<br/>
 math), reading, grammar (this was my FAVORITE in school).  We could do <br/>
music<br/>
 & art & go to the library & have &quot;P.E.&quot; (might even help me there! lol)<br/>
 Nature walks, I could even teach him Spanish & sign language.  I know I<br/>
 could do it...I really think I could.  I&#39;m pretty excited about the<br/>
 possibility...just the cost is daunting right now...& is <br/>
impossible...unless<br/>
 I can trade...which is a real possibility.  I know I could do it, the only<br/>
 thing I worry about is him listening to me lol.<br/>
<br/>
 So, my main questions are as follows:<br/>
 Have you ever pulled a child out of pub school in the middle of the year?<br/>
<br/>
 Is HS&#39;ing a big adjustment for the PS child?<br/>
<br/>
 How do you choose which &quot;curriculum&quot; to use?<br/>
<br/>
 Tell me about the different methods of HS&#39;ing?  I&#39;ve seen several <br/>
mentioned,<br/>
 traditional, co-op, unschooling & a couple others.  Which is best?  How do<br/>
 you know what they need to know (in the even they want to re-enter PS in<br/>
 later years)?<br/>
<br/>
 Is there anything else I should take into consideration before making my<br/>
 final decision?<br/>
<br/>
 Thanks soooo much for reading this & for your time!<br/>

<br/>
yes i took my son out in the middle of 5th grade-<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>depends on if you are &quot;doing school at home&quot; or &quot;unschooling&quot; it is <br/>
two very different things. I tried to school at home and used the <br/>
public school ciriculum as a guide since I thought I would send him <br/>
back in a year. School at home &quot;works&quot; for some families who want to <br/>
make sure the kids know the same things that schooled kids have to <br/>
know.<br/>
<br/>
unschooling is very different it is not doing school- there are <br/>
varrying degrees- some people let the child choose what he wants to <br/>
learn and then &quot;learns&quot; it in the traditional manner (books, papers, <br/>
internet, classes), others allow the child to learn what they want <br/>
to but still hold onto traditional methods of parenting (chores, <br/>
limits,) there are still others who want what is called radical <br/>
unschooling which is trusting that the child knows what they want <br/>
from birth and they can be co-partners in the household. It is <br/>
letting go of the need to control and let them fly.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about trusting that your child will learn what they <br/>
need to by living life- they learn to walk because they see us <br/>
walking and it works faster than crawling, they learn to talk so <br/>
they can tell us what the heck they want, they learn to read because <br/>
they see you reading and they have books around them and tv too. <br/>
They learn to do math by living in the real world and do ing <br/>
everyday math, they learn to write because they see the written word <br/>
and want to do it, they learn history and science by watching tv, <br/>
video and books and current events. <br/>
<br/>
They learn because they are human- they learn what is important to <br/>
them not what is important to their parents or the school system. <br/>
They learn because they want to, they need to - to satisfy their own <br/>
thirst for knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is scary for begining because it is scary to &quot;trust&quot; <br/>
your child to take care of themself with you as facilitator not <br/>
teacher. It takes his interests and let him go from there from one <br/>
thing to the next in his own time and space and time.<br/>
<br/>
my daughter is 4.5 and she is unschooled- she is amazing- sponge bob <br/>
teaches her a lot of new things and the computer has 6 games that <br/>
are hers, these games taught her the abc&#39;s and is teaching her to <br/>
read. she could type her name first and surprised me that she could <br/>
write her name. All without a lesson. She knows a lot of things that <br/>
are not &quot;schooly&quot; but important anyway. She is free to eat and sleep <br/>
and think and play and learn and do what SHE wants to and needs to. <br/>
We do not have chores but she loves to vacumm and clean when she <br/>
wants to, she eats when and what she wants and loves to tell her <br/>
older schooled friends that homeschool is fun- no I will not be <br/>
putting her into school she is mush too free for that<br/>
<br/>
your son and you will need to deschool (take a long break) before <br/>
unschooling- declare summer break and just play and have fun. Read <br/>
about unschooling and deschooling and listen to your heart and his <br/>
pleas.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps<br/>

 <br/>
I don&#39;t believed that children need to learn to get used to people  being <br/>
jerks.  Being around jerks is &quot;contagious&quot;.  It makes  other children jerks, so <br/>
that they can fit in.  It is hard enough for  a parent to be around jerks.  <br/>
Children do not need to be around this.   If he is home schooled, and develops a <br/>
strong sense of self, and self  confidence, then he will be less likely <br/>
succumb to the peer pressure of also  being a jerk when he is in an adult world.  No <br/>
one deserves to be treated  poorly.  Your son deserves to be treated with <br/>
dignity and respect.   Thus, he will grow up to be an adult that treats others <br/>
with dignity and  respect.  No child needs to, or deserves to be bullied.  This <br/>
is one  of the major reasons why many chose to homeschool.  <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;It just kills me that he is sooo sensitive,  <br/>

 <br/>
What great qualities to have!  Those characteristics can be a great  use when <br/>
he is older.  Maybe he will be a doctor that actually has bedside  manner!!!  <br/>
Don&#39;t let his good qualities be squashed by having him in  school, where him <br/>
being him is made out to being a bad thing by jerks.  <br/>
 <br/>
As far as finances, I remember seeing books out about homeschooling on a  <br/>
dime.  If you google or look at amazon.com, you may be able to find  them.  <br/>
 <br/>
Good luck!  <br/>

All I can say is if he is asking you to homeschool, jump on the opportunity and pull him out immediately. My daughter begged me to &quot;home teach&#39; her all through the first thru third grades. It broke my heart but I worked full time and did not see how I could have done it. In retrospect, I could have hooked up with the unschooling community and probably worked it out by switching shifts and paying someone to keep her in thier home on the days I could not cover. But at the time I had no information and knew no one else who homeschooled or unschooled. She was ok in fourth and fifth grades due to some very unconventional teachers, but sixth thru eighth was hell. She endured all that school and I really regret it. Don&#39;t put your son through it. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-192325781">Hi Beth,<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to pull your son out of school.  There are <br/>
definitely some people here who have done so, but there is a big <br/>
unschooling conference going on this week in North Carolina, and <br/>
many of the regulars at this site are participating in the <br/>
conference.  So, you may not get as many replies as usual right <br/>
now :)<br/>
<br/>
I also do not agree that he needs to get used to people being <br/>
jerks.  Wouldn&#39;t it be wonderful if we were all surprised to find <br/>
jerks?  It&#39;s pretty great if kids know that they deserve to be <br/>
treated well.  Why would it be acceptable to be whacked in the <br/>
head?  If an adult got hit by someone else, it would be considered <br/>
assault.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt;  Is HS&#39;ing a big adjustment for the PS child?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It depends on the child and probably how long they&#39;ve been in school <br/>
too.  Your son is very young!  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

<br/>
Well, this is specifically an unschooling site, so we feel that <br/>
unschooling is best:)  As unschoolers, we do not use any curriulum.  <br/>
I encourage you to do some more reading about unschooling and also <br/>
to try to relax.  As far as finding things to do and people to be <br/>
with, how about you follow your son&#39;s lead?  Just hang out at home <br/>
for a bit and let him decompress.  Gradually he will probably tell <br/>
you what he wants - more friends, sports, books, games, etc.  You <br/>
could go to the library and just pick out a variety of stuff to see <br/>
what he likes.  There&#39;s no need to rush.  Ask him if he wants to go <br/>
to the playground or to church or to an orchard or a farm or a <br/>
construction site or a movie or a lake or a sports event or whatever <br/>
he&#39;s interested in, and let him know that you take him seriously.  <br/>
<br/>
If he doesn&#39;t think that his teacher would help him out when someone <br/>
hits him, show him that you will help him when he needs it. It&#39;s <br/>
great that he&#39;s young and will tell you what is bothering him and <br/>
what he wants.  A lot of kids stop telling their parents these <br/>
things after trying and being ignored or not taken seriously.  <br/>
You&#39;re his mom!  You can help him enjoy life again and help him to <br/>
know that it&#39;s not okay for people to hit him or for his teacher to <br/>
be mean to him.  He&#39;s six years old, and he needs your help.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!  And welcome to the site.  There are a lot of links here <br/>
as well as all the previous messages that will give you a ton of <br/>
info.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-802233900">Hi Beth,<br/>
<br/>
I have been where you are and I have to say that I don&#39;t think you <br/>
can get your boy out fast enough.<br/>
<br/>
We had absolutely no trouble transitioning to homeschool.  We <br/>
consider removing him from ps to be the best parenting decision we&#39;ve <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-702940623">Donna and Brian,<br/>
<br/>
I sympathize with your deschooling experience, as we am going through <br/>
the same thing right now. Our ds (age 10) stays glued to one screen <br/>
or another most of the time, when left to his own devices. But, even <br/>
though it has ony been a couple of months since I would say we <br/>
started deschooling, we are seeing some positive signs. He seems <br/>
happier. He appears less stressed. He smiles more. He&#39;s more willing <br/>
to try some new adventures. I think we are observing something about <br/>
just how stressful school was, and about how it was not about <br/>
learning, in many ways, but, in our case, about coping.<br/>
<br/>
It is discouraging that ds does not want to read. Last school year he <br/>
seemed to love reading, devouring 400-page books like they were <br/>
nothing. Now, it&#39;s one or two reference books for a few minutes every <br/>
now and then. He likes being read to sometimes, so we keep doing <br/>
that. I trust it will return to him when he is ready.<br/>
<br/>
I also regret I did not hs from the start, but there were <br/>
circumstances then that dictated what I could do, and I have to get <br/>
over that. We are where we are today, and there is so much we can <br/>
learn together. I do believe those who say we parents need to <br/>
deschool in this period, too. It is a challenge to keep letting go of <br/>
old ways of seeing him, and expectations about what he should be <br/>
doing. I re-focus myself on this every day, as it is not yet a habit. <br/>
I remind myself to watch, listen to him. And, we do different fun <br/>
things out of the house like meeting other hs-ers, going to different <br/>
museums/parks/gardens, going on long hikes. And, I try to keep my <br/>
fretting to a minimum, and private. This seems like such a huge life-<br/>
lesson time for each of us, and all of us as a family.<br/>
<br/>
I plan to deschool for 6 months and then see where we are.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-999438610">We took our son out of 4th grade at the end of February 2007. He was <br/>
in 4th grade. Sometimes I feel SO guilty that I didn&#39;t homeschool <br/>
(unschool!) from the very start. It just eats away at me! He was SO <br/>
happy to leave school. <br/>
I still remember his first day of kindergarten, and the tears in my <br/>
eyes as he walked into the school with the other 5 & 6-years old <br/>
kids. I want to go back and start right then, and tell him he doesn&#39;t <br/>
have to go into that dumb school and sit for hours...<br/>
I remember him being so excited about going to school, and how much <br/>
fun it was... in kindergarten.. in the beginning of the year.. then <br/>
the teacher was mean.<br/>
Then came 1st grade, and the teacher was mean.<br/>
Then came 2nd grade.. and this teacher really was mean- I could hear <br/>
her yelling at the kids from the hallway outside the classroom.<br/>
We moved to a different school district halfway through 2nd grade. <br/>
The new school, right across the street from our new house, was not <br/>
any better. In fact, it was worse!<br/>
Not just in the lack of quality teachers, but the system was so very <br/>
out of whack.<br/>
It is just so sad.<br/>
I love being home with my son (11) and daughter (2).<br/>
My son is so much happier now that he has time to do the things he <br/>
loves to do. Ok, so for the past few months, much of that time is <br/>
consumed with the Nintendo DS. And the computer. And twice-a-day <br/>
episodes of Myth Busters and late night episodes of Naruto on Cartoon <br/>
Network.<br/>
But I can&#39;t say I don&#39;t notice every single night, after his &quot;shows&quot;, <br/>
he gets into bed and reads The Boxcar Children, or Deltora Quest, or <br/>
whatever he is into that week. <br/>
And his creativity is not gone in the least. Even the school system <br/>
couldn&#39;t take that away from him. I&#39;m just glad we pulled him out of <br/>
there before they had the chance to sap it.<br/>
I feel like we are truly living life now. We have the opportunity to <br/>
enjoy it. He can be a child.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, my main questions are as follows:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; Have you ever pulled a child out of pub school in the middle of<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1287022873">Hi Beth,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Vanessa, and I have been<br/>
homeschooling/unschooling my children since the end of<br/>
last year.  It was really odd, because I wanted to<br/>
pull them (I have 2 kids, 1 son and 1 daughter) out of<br/>
school during Easter break, but hubby wanted to have<br/>
them end the year in ps.  My son was in 4th grade, and<br/>
my daughter was in 3rd.<br/>
<br/>
We had alot of issues with teachers, the principal and<br/>
bullying.  Needless to say, my son was miserable, and<br/>
so was my daughter.  We researched about<br/>
homeschooling, and found some good books at the<br/>
library, and also alot of information at Sandra Dodd&#39;s<br/>
website.  I also had alot of support from the groups<br/>
that I have joined.  <br/>
<br/>
I think for you homeschooling choices, you need to<br/>
find what fits with your family.  With us the choice<br/>
was easy.  After all the stuff they had to do with ps,<br/>
we decided that unschooling was a much better fit with<br/>
our lifestyle.  We didn&#39;t want to take the kids out of<br/>
school, and then put them right back at it, at the<br/>
kitchen table.  We did however buy the 4th and 5th<br/>
grade all in one curriculum workbook from Sam&#39;s Club (<br/>
I think it was about $10).  Me and the kids opened it<br/>
up, and looked at some of the stuff it had for them to<br/>
do, and closed them.  We haven&#39;t taken them off the<br/>
shelf since.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s amazing to see how much they can learn, when they<br/>
relax, and show me the things that they are interested<br/>
in.  Kids are truely amazing.<br/>
<br/>
My son loves to play video games, and search for<br/>
things on the internet, and loves watching Naruto. <br/>
It&#39;s gotten to the point, that I really get into<br/>
watching it with him. We have some really good<br/>
discussions about the characters, and what we think<br/>
might be their next moves, the Naruto books that are<br/>
out, and who our favorite characters are.  We even<br/>
found a store not too far from here that carries some<br/>
Naruto stuff. We have learned about what takes the<br/>
yucky stuff off from pennies, and what it takes to dig<br/>
up hostas, and things about hurricanes.  I like<br/>
unschooling, because you learn things from living<br/>
life, not by sitting at the table for hours learning<br/>
from books.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone can tell you which way to go.  It<br/>
all depends on what you feel you need to do.  My kids<br/>
won&#39;t attend public school anymore.  They are happiest<br/>
at home, doing the things they enjoy.  There are books<br/>
that tell you what your child should know at each<br/>
grade level. <br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps.  I forgot to mention that we live<br/>
in Michigan.  We are happy homeschoolers, and enjoy<br/>
the freedom that homeschooling provides.  We travel<br/>
more now, than we did before, and have alot of fun<br/>
noticing things outside, that we normally wouldn&#39;t<br/>
see.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck on your decision.  If your son would like a<br/>
pen pal, let me know.  I know my son would love to be<br/>
able to talk to kids about Naruto.  It&#39;s his favorite<br/>
subject.<br/>

that she goes through cycles of learning and interest. She&#39;ll spend <br/>
a few months being passionate about reading, for example, and then <br/>
drop it entirely for awhile and focus on something else - cutting <br/>
paper, at the moment. <br/>
<br/>
Certainly kids who have been in school have some baggage to overcome <br/>
and healing to do - my stepson is still healing in many ways after <br/>
nearly a year away from school. Its good to be aware, though, that <br/>
natural learning frequently doesn&#39;t look as &quot;well rounded&quot; as school-<br/>
type learning is intended to be. Its *natural* for people to immerse <br/>
themselves in an interest for a period of time and allow other <br/>
interests to wane or even drop them entirely. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1051610293"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;cycles of learning and interest. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Learning is a lot like eating - you eat some then you digest some. <br/>
While digesting, you may or may not want to browse the menu/buffet <br/>
table. And, digesting is basically invisible (except the occasional <br/>
burp or whatever), just as learning is inside the learner. You <br/>
really don&#39;t want to go poking someone&#39;s stomach to make sure <br/>
they&#39;re full, that can get messy. And, too, if you&#39;ve had a not-so-<br/>
great experience with fried clams, you&#39;re not likely to want <br/>
anything that LOOKS like a fried clam for quite a while. The more <br/>
someone pushes you to &quot;just try these&quot; the more likely you are to <br/>
back off. But, if you are given time and allowed to come back to it <br/>
in your own time you may find that you like clam chowder but still <br/>
not fried clams. I know I always thought I hated avocadoes. And no <br/>
one pushed me on it. Then one day, I ordered a salad at a restaurant <br/>
and, yup you guessed it, it had nice fresh avocado slices on it. I <br/>
was in love. The problem was that I had mostly only ever seen them <br/>
mashed up into &quot;gloppy moldy&quot; as I used to call, guacamole to the <br/>
rest of the world and the only times I had tried it, it was way too <br/>
spicy for me. But, I&#39;ve found that I love fresh avocado in salads, <br/>
in home made (not too spicy) guacamole, and in really fresh sushi.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-200867787">Thank you for this Merideth.  This is important to remember in the deschooling process and the learning to unschool process.  I stiff feel so sad that my kids have let some reading go.  I work hard to keep the panic inside as I watch them choose only computer games and movies.  We do have some remarkable moments together and the stress of school and homework has completely left our lives.  After a couple of months I have no doubt it is the right thing to do I only hope that I will see all their interests of creativity and love of learning trickle back with the same passion I used to see before school did its damage.  I so appreciate what gets shared here it surely helps me to keep being patient and to keep trusting my children.   Donna<br/>

that she goes through cycles of learning and interest. She&#39;ll spend <br/>
a few months being passionate about reading, for example, and then <br/>
drop it entirely for awhile and focus on something else - cutting <br/>
paper, at the moment. <br/>
<br/>
Certainly kids who have been in school have some baggage to overcome <br/>
and healing to do - my stepson is still healing in many ways after <br/>
nearly a year away from school. Its good to be aware, though, that <br/>
natural learning frequently doesn&#39;t look as &quot;well rounded&quot; as school-<br/>
type learning is intended to be. Its *natural* for people to immerse <br/>
themselves in an interest for a period of time and allow other <br/>
interests to wane or even drop them entirely. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-67849137">Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
My family and I just moved to the Dallas area in August and we are <br/>
trying to find a home.  I have been trying to research school <br/>
districts and such, but I am becoming more and more anxious about <br/>
sending our daughter to school next year.  I have been considering <br/>
homeschooling for the last 4 years and I was just curious how you came <br/>
to the decision to homeschool.  No holding back!  Please be homest-- <br/>
the more information, the better :)  Thank you<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1932760149">Kimberly,<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been living in the Dallas area for several years, so welcome!<br/>
<br/>
How did we decide?  Several factors.<br/>
<br/>
We did not like how the school system is inflexible regarding how each kid<br/>
learns.  It was more that the child must learn the way the school teaches,<br/>
and if the child has difficulty learning that way, well, he/she has a<br/>
&quot;learning disability&quot; or is &quot;average&quot;.  School appeared to us to be great as<br/>
long as the child in question learns best being spoon-fed information and<br/>
not allowed a lot of personal creativity.  The school system also appeared<br/>
to enforce &quot;obedience,&quot; and though spankings are now unheard-of in my neck<br/>
of the woods, schools have become creative in how they punish children.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t want to put my kids through that, especially as dd#2 is a very<br/>
physical, spirited kid.  She would definitely be labeled as having some kind<br/>
of &quot;disability.&quot;  dd#1 is a lot more pliable, and in my mind more delicate.<br/>
I don&#39;t want her creativity getting snuffed out, though I&#39;m sure she would<br/>
&quot;thrive&quot; (ha-ha) in school.<br/>
<br/>
Reinforcing this was the work of John Holt.  That really put us on the road<br/>
to trusting our kids with their own learning and curiosity.  Some of his<br/>
stuff was absolutely amazing and made so much sense.<br/>
<br/>
Add to this what John Taylor Gatto has put out.  He claims (and I believe<br/>
him) that the school system was put in place to create obedient factory<br/>
workers.  That factory could be an assembly line or being a code jockey like<br/>
me.  He has more claims, but please check him out as well as John Holt.<br/>
