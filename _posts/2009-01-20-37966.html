<div id="ygrps-yiv-44133347">The issue of bribes comes up quite a bit, and I want to just weigh in on  the <br/>
positive side of a bribe, just to keep things interesting.<br/>
 <br/>
Julian has three parents. Two of them have those signatures that start out  <br/>
with maybe one letter and turns into a scrawl at the end. You know the ones --  <br/>
the signatures where when you go to cash their checks they have to check the  <br/>
signature card at the bank, or the cashier gives the person a strange look.  <br/>
(Needless to say, I am NOT the parent with the scrawl signature.) It drives me <br/>
 insane.<br/>
 <br/>
When he was younger, I told Julian that I did not care even a little bit if  <br/>
he ever did cursive, except that I really wanted him to have a legible  <br/>
signature. I was willing to bribe him. He found this hilarious, and accepted the  <br/>
bribe. (Or at least the idea of the bribe. Neither of us remembers what the  <br/>
bribe was or if he ever received it.) Julian now has a  <br/>
not-particularly-pretty-but perfectly-legible signature. He never uses cursive  for anything else. We <br/>
are both happy.<br/>
 <br/>
I think the guidelines are: Make it clear that the issue is the parent&#39;s.  <br/>
Make it clear that the kid does NOT have to accept it and there will be no hard  <br/>
feelings. Make it clear and light that you are aware that you are bribing the <br/>
 kid.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s our only bribery story. I wonder if I could bribe  him <br/>
to do more stuff now.... hmmm...<br/>
