<div id="ygrps-yiv-197052872">I joined the SCA (Society for Creative Anachronism) YEARS ago and got out<br/>
about 8 for a variety of reasons, one being that I had small children and at<br/>
the time children were practically ignored and so going to events was a<br/>
whole lot like primitive camping in funny clothes chasing after children.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t need to dress up in funny clothes to go off in the woods by myself.<br/>
*Anyway* we&#39;ve recently gotten back involved and there is a very active<br/>
&quot;minister of children&quot; who is very enthusiastic about doing things with the<br/>
kids and helping them feel included.  And the majority of her ideas sink<br/>
like lead balloons with my kids.  They are very very schoolish in nature.<br/>
Her latest project is to create a series of &quot;lessons&quot; for the kids to do.<br/>
The lesson would include a written description of an activity, project, art,<br/>
science or historical aspect (Mongols, French Ren., High Gothic, etc.)<br/>
After the children read the lesson then they would be given a comprehension<br/>
test to see what they learned.  If they &quot;pass&quot; the test then they will get<br/>
some sort of points for &quot;Page School.&quot;   ICK!!!  This is a wonderful<br/>
organisation that spurred me into wanting to know more about history.  Not<br/>
because of tests or achievements but because I found living history<br/>
interesting!  This just sucks all the fun out of the organisation and makes<br/>
it SO much more like school.  I wrote a short reply offering a different<br/>
idea (like adults taking on &quot;students&quot; and sharing with them the things that<br/>
they know, learning through doing).  Instead of spending hours and hours<br/>
creating essentially &quot;reading comprehension tests&quot; we could create a<br/>
database of skills that the children (and adults) could reference to and<br/>
find someone who is doing something that they are interested in.  I even<br/>
snuck in a link to Sandra Dodd&#39;s website (her SCA side - which is filled<br/>
with lots of unschooly ideas LOL!) about teaching and learning.  She replied<br/>
back to me and said (basically) &quot;I respect your opinion, but you are wrong<br/>
because this is the way that kids learn best.&quot;  GAG!<br/>
<br/>
Why do people take something that is enjoyable and make it so not fun?  Why<br/>
do people feel that the only way a person (particularly a child) can learn<br/>
something is from reading something and taking a test?  I never even thought<br/>
that way when my kids did go to school!<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, I just needed to vent somewhere that was safe.<br/>
