<div id="ygrps-yiv-905360374">Just had to say that although I don&#39;t often post, I do soooo appreciate <br/>
the time and energy put into this group by the list owners and <br/>
dedicated &quot;veterans&quot;.....don&#39;t leave me flailing in the dark!<br/>
<br/>
One thing I so love about stopping in here to listen to the <br/>
conversation is that it makes me THINK.  And think mostly about my own <br/>
attitudes, fears, hang-ups, and &quot;needs improvement&quot; areas.  Not my <br/>
family&#39;s, but my own.  Because every time I start feeling crazed over <br/>
how I think someone else should be behaving/spending time/whatever, I <br/>
come to this list and read and my heart grows softer towards my child.  <br/>
And I grow a little bit as a person.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all.  Happy Mom&#39;s day to all you moms out there!<br/>
<br/>

Thanks for writing this Deanna!   A lot how I feel.<br/>
<br/>
I, too, mostly lurk nowadays, but when I first joined I remember <br/>
feeling &quot;uncomfortable&quot; when I was &quot;challenged&quot; about something I <br/>
posted, but I know it was because I was beginning a journey that was <br/>
taking me out of my comfort zone.  We&#39;re very new to unschooling, in <br/>
fact I had never heard of it until a couple of years ago when I was <br/>
researching homeschooling (my dd is 13, we just pulled her out last <br/>
June).   We have NOT lived an unschooling life from day one, and I <br/>
know there were times I felt like an outsider.   BUT, it didn&#39;t stop <br/>
me from reading and asking questions and I&#39;m very grateful for the <br/>
experienced unschoolers on this list who give of themselves to help <br/>
those of us still working on living it (I &quot;GET&quot; it, though)!<br/>
<br/>
I joined many different groups, some were a good fit, many were <br/>
not.  I&#39;m glad there ARE so many, everyone can find what works for <br/>
them.  I know this list works for me - thanks for being here for us!<br/>
