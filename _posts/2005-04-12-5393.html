<div id="ygrps-yiv-283349966">I&#39;m on an e-mail list with a group of ladies that I truly admire.  <br/>
These are strong sensitive and caring womyn that I have known since <br/>
Mary Elayne was in diapers.  We&#39;ve been through divorces, deaths, <br/>
births, celebrations of milestones, etc together.  Today, however, <br/>
one of the womyn posted about a problem her son was having in <br/>
school.  Not completing assignments and failing his class.  She <br/>
created a contract that I found to be very harsh and with NO <br/>
positive conditions, such as if he completes A,B,C he will be given <br/>
something special.  Everything is &quot;you must do X,Y,Z or you won&#39;t <br/>
get &quot;ordinary&quot; things&quot; (such as television, video games, computer <br/>
time.)  So I posted that before I would set up a penalizing contract <br/>
(which IMO is setting this child up for only failure) I would find <br/>
out what the root of the problem was.  Why wasn&#39;t her son completing <br/>
these assignments?  Why did he feel that lying about turning them in <br/>
was a good thing to do?  (Probably because if he had told the truth <br/>
that he hadn&#39;t it would have had severe consequences.)  :-(<br/>
<br/>
This really hit home with me because I went through the same thing <br/>
with Emily last year.  She wasn&#39;t turning in assignments and failing <br/>
her classes even though she was making 100% on all her tests (that <br/>
is just bass ackwards if you ask me!) But I took a totally different <br/>
approach.  Instead of blaming the child I blamed the school.  <br/>
Instead of making my child do these assinine assignments I tried <br/>
working with the school on a compromise (which eventually led to <br/>
Emily declaring her independence from school.)  I have just never <br/>
understood why children need to spend 6-8 hours at school and come <br/>
home with 2+ hours of more assignments.  Seems to me if it can&#39;t be <br/>
taught in 6-8 hours the kid isn&#39;t going to get it in 2 more at <br/>
home.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;sigh&gt;  It just saddens me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Michelle,<br/>
This is on my list of why we&#39;re going to be homeschooling in the <br/>
fall.  My daughter struggles with certain issues in school (mostly <br/>
not fitting into the &quot;typical learner&quot; i.e. she doesn&#39;t learn well <br/>
sequentially, which is how many teach), plus the organization, rules <br/>
etc and especially has difficulty with math.<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m expected to work all this extra time with her at home because <br/>
she can&#39;t get it right at school, then I might as well teach her <br/>
myself at home!  More of the same (repetition, busy work etc) does <br/>
not work for my daughter.  We sometimes need to find another way, but <br/>
once she learns it, it&#39;s permanent.  Then she wants to move on.  Part <br/>
of it is boredom too.<br/>
<br/>
Rant away!  We call in venting in our house!<br/>
