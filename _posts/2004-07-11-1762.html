<div id="ygrps-yiv-969153866">I want to thank all of you for your helpful suggestions for me regarding William.  He is a lot of fun and is encouraging me to learn so many things I otherwise would not have.  We are having so much fun learning so much from every thing we do and he is amazing...like many of you said, I can&#39;t see ever worrying that he isn&#39;t learning enough!  His is interested in just about everything and tries to understand as much as he can and is *always* hungry for more.  He is really an inspiration to me.  I have ordered the book you shared, Karen, can&#39;t wait to share it w him.  And, Deb, GREAT IDEA, thank you, for your suggestion that I make a book for him.  This will be a wonderful project for me to practice my storytelling muscles, and I plan to illustrate it for him as well- I need this creative endeavor.  This is going to be a lot of fun.  I finished two stories already!  <br/>
Thanks to you all for many good thoughts for me and I appreciate all of you taking the time to respond!  <br/>
I know you all are enjoying your children as much as I am and I am so glad I have found others who are able to do so...you are all helping me so much to relax and enjoy and to remember to own my own problems and values (and to change a lot of my thinking as well)  and allow my Will to grow and become according to his own needs.  <br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
Millie<br/>
