<div id="ygrps-yiv-340673936">&quot;I am glad Elisa&#39;s tv watch/wait only lasted 6 months. Mine is going on<br/>
many, many years now. I am trying not to limit it, but it just gets<br/>
worse. How long do I wait.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve never started.  The waiting begins when you truly trust and let <br/>
go....you haven&#39;t done that yet, so you aren&#39;t going to see the same <br/>
results as someone like Elisa.<br/>
<br/>
I went through a really hard adjustment in learning to TRUST fully.<br/>
I remember &quot;trying&quot; to allow them to choose television and just <br/>
getting all tetchy and frustrated when they seemed obsessed, so I <br/>
thought I needed to make little comments, or push them to get away <br/>
from it after a long time.<br/>
Doesn&#39;t work that way.<br/>
It wasn&#39;t until I saw television as valuable, until I saw my children <br/>
as capable, WHOLE, intelligent beings that didn&#39;t need coercion, until <br/>
I joined in WITH them and saw it as just another option in life that <br/>
we got the kind of results folks are talking about here.<br/>
<br/>
Not only did I need to fully trust my children, they needed to trust <br/>
me. I had destroyed trust for many years by controlling television. It <br/>
took time before they knew I wasn&#39;t going to do that again.<br/>
<br/>
You haven&#39;t waited years. You&#39;ve not even begun the process.<br/>

<br/>
Ren&#39;s right. Have you heard the rule of thumb that it takes one month <br/>
for<br/>
each year of school or school-at-home of DEschooling before you can <br/>
consider<br/>
yourself UNschooling?<br/>
<br/>
The trust has to be there FIRST. You have to believe this will work and <br/>
is right.<br/>
<br/>
THEN you can start counting the months! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
*BUT* if you backtrack or make a snide comment or push a book or insist <br/>
on<br/>
a report or limit tv ----*ANY* violation of the child&#39;s trust in you <br/>
and this process---<br/>
start counting the months again.<br/>
<br/>
So, no---you haven&#39;t even started yet.<br/>

I SOOOOO wish that Ren&#39;s process was still in the archives at <br/>
unschooling.com!!!<br/>
<br/>
To those of you shaking your heads at Kathy and wondering *how* it can <br/>
be this<br/>
hard, I did the same thing with Ren. She whined and bantered and <br/>
bitched and<br/>
argued and just made everyone crazy! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
She challenged every single unschooling issue. She fought every inch. <br/>
She was<br/>
exhausting! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, she got it. Now she&#39;s dangerous! &lt;g&gt; and fun! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-853165120">&lt;&lt;It wasn&#39;t until I saw television as valuable&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My 14yo decided to try a British Literature class.  She was a little intimidated because she was the only unschooler in a class of school-at-homers.  She came home saying she thought it would be ok.  She had been assigned to read Beowulf and when the teacher was giving the introduction, my daughter said she already knew most of it from watching tv and movies.<br/>

the messages were there at the time. It worked just like the real site.<br/>

What is amazing? That Ren didn&#39;t get it right away?  Or that I was <br/>
devoted to school as a kid and as a home-room mom? &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That Joyce is an engineer or that Sandra was and Pam is a teacher? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
None of us started out as unschoolers: we all had to get here too. And <br/>
we know it&#39;s not easy!<br/>

Stick around. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
