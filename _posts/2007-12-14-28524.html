<div id="ygrps-yiv-1298625983">I&#39;m trying to wrap my brain around a concrete definition of &quot;unschooling&quot;. <br/>
Does it mean not ever teaching children anything, including responsible <br/>
behavior, respect, morality, etc.?<br/>
<br/>
Please understand I&#39;m not asking this in an abrasive manner--I&#39;m honestly <br/>
trying to understand what unschooling IS. We have homeschooled for nearly 20 <br/>
years and have always been rather relaxed in our approach. Lately we&#39;ve been <br/>
so relaxed that it has been suggested that we are in actuality <br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot;. So I decided to start reading John Holt&#39;s writings and join a <br/>
couple of US groups to understand what the term actually means. Any <br/>
information, links, etc. would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It helps to look at it as &quot;help them learn&quot; rather than &quot;teach&quot;.  <br/>
Teaching is about moving information the teacher wants into their  <br/>
heads. Learning is about helping them reach out to what interests them.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers model responsible behavior, respect and morality. Kids  <br/>
whose needs have been respected grow up to respect others needs. Kids  <br/>
whose parents have acted responsibly toward them grow up to be  <br/>
responsible. For the most part kids will adopt our morals because  <br/>
those morals are responsible for the joyful, loving, safe environment  <br/>
they&#39;ve grown up in.<br/>
<br/>
If someone makes you act responsible and makes you act respectful and  <br/>
makes you adhere to their morals, do you feel more responsible,  <br/>
respectful and moral? I feel the need to be the total opposite of  <br/>
what they want from me! I think the only reason parents think making  <br/>
kids go through the motions eventually leads to real responsibility,  <br/>
etc. is because eventually kids grow up and their view point changes  <br/>
and they naturally see the value in those. They see value in being  <br/>
respectful of those they respect (often conventionally parented kids  <br/>
respect their friends more than their parents because their friends  <br/>
are respectful of them and their parents aren&#39;t (though the parents  <br/>
*think* they&#39;re being respectful!)). They see the value in putting  <br/>
forth an effort and being responsible about things *they* care about.<br/>
<br/>
Kids want to be social creatures. They don&#39;t want to hurt others  <br/>
while in the pursuit of what they want, but they haven&#39;t been on the  <br/>
planet long so they don&#39;t have the skills. We help them find better  <br/>
ways to get what they want that doesn&#39;t involve hurting someone. And  <br/>
we&#39;re patient with their learning. Just because they&#39;ve been told to  <br/>
use words instead of hitting doesn&#39;t mean they can always figure out  <br/>
how to get something with just words. Stop the hitting of course!  <br/>
Everyone deserves to feel safe in their home. But we don&#39;t assume the  <br/>
child is being evil or disobedient for hitting. They just need more  <br/>
help. (They often need our presence more so we can be there to notice  <br/>
needs before escalation to hitting begins. We can&#39;t stop all of it,  <br/>
but it can help eliminate a lot.)<br/>
<br/>
Do you have specific questions. While the principles are good, they  <br/>
often sound too airy fairy ;-) Specific examples -- current ones  <br/>
preferably -- help clarify how the principles work in practice.<br/>

I think that is something we do by showing Love and keeping in mind that love <br/>
is a verb. So we show, we lead so to speak, by example. We discuss. But we do <br/>
not preach or dictate a value system. <br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps! I&#39;m WAY behind - computer pooped out on us, so I&#39;m super <br/>
limited these days, so you probably have excellent answers already, but I just <br/>
wanted to pop in with one of the ways I look at that. <br/>

Take care,<br/>
