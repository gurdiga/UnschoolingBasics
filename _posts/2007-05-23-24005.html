Well, the way the camp works is that you don&#39;t have to sleep there, but <br/>
you *must* buy a meal plan. So it can&#39;t be *too* last minute. My <br/>
numbers are supposed to be in to them by August 5. So I&#39;m asking <br/>
everyone to be paid up by July 31 to allow us a few days to confirm our <br/>
numbers.<br/>
<br/>
So the final date would be July 31. Absolutely no &quot;day of&quot; <br/>
registrations any more.<br/>
