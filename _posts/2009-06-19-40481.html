<div id="ygrps-yiv-1818340956">Hi,<br/>
we&#39;re seriously considering moving onto an Indian Reservation in  <br/>
Western Montana and have a rental house lined up already.<br/>
I&#39;m wondering what the &quot;laws&quot; would be regarding home/unschooling not  <br/>
just in MT, but on American Indian tribal lands.<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1390344510">Hey- I asked my husband (His family is from Ft Peck) and he said because <br/>
a reservation is a sovereign nation it would be up to the tribe.  HTH!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You need to check with the tribe-Native American tribes are considered soverign nations. The tribal laws are what is used on a reservation, not the state&#39;s law. The tribes have treaties with the states and the federal government dealing with taxes and gambling-but they are considered their own nation. <br/>
<br/>

In the state I live in, many many people get car tags from their tribes. It&#39;s kind of fun to play &#39;licence tag&#39; when you can see tags of 25 odd tribes just driving around Chickasha Oklahoma.</div>
