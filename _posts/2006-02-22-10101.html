Imagination Tribe!!!<br/>
<br/>
We aren&#39;t strictly for ATC&#39;s though. We do all sorts of<br/>
projects....did a circle journal last year, working on an ABC book<br/>
currently. You can pick and choose what you&#39;re involved with, or just<br/>
read and get inspiration from shared information, links and<br/>
recommendations.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2064178218">&quot;What kind of art does it have to be?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Anything and everything goes for ATC&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My son is five and a half and he wants to do it. He loves cards and<br/>
heard me talking about it with my husband. He draws, paints and does<br/>
free art on the &#39;puter. Are there guidelines to making the cards?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is a good site for guidelines:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cedarseed.com/air/atc.html">http://www.cedarseed.com/air/atc.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Beyond that, I would just have some cards pre-cut and ready for him to<br/>
use whenever inspiration hits. We have a big stack of cards and if I<br/>
leave colored pencils or paint out, Jalen will inevitable come along<br/>
and create a few cards.  I did print some computer art into small<br/>
sizes and glued to cards. We printed it on photo paper (inspired by<br/>
another person&#39;s cards) and they turned out awesome.<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;Does anyone swap at MHEA conference? &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know anything about that conference, but the NE unschooling<br/>
conference and the Live and Learn conference will have ATC trades that<br/>
I&#39;ll be organizing. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Is it a kid thing only?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Why would we let THEM have all the fun??? It&#39;s for everyone!!;)<br/>
<br/>
You may have missed the post talking about my other list, Imagination<br/>
Tribe where we do trades through the mail and other fun projects.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1272280388">I will check out cedarseed.com. Quentin has some projects that he wants to<br/>
make into cards but will be too big. I thought about scanning them in and<br/>
shrinking them down to fit on a trade size card.<br/>

in digital art and photo collages and scrap booking but I haven&#39;t figured<br/>
