<div id="ygrps-yiv-996499419">I have a daughter with Aspergers also who is very into the carbs and  dairy <br/>
also. She has battled constipation all her life. i am sure that our kids  are <br/>
very different in many ways, and i am very new here and more inclined to  <br/>
&#39;interfere&quot; in my kids lives, still a work in progress in my house.... but one  <br/>
thing that has worked well for us in this particular case.....<br/>
I buy coconut flour which is very very high fiber (even higher than wheat  <br/>
bran) and add it to breads, rolls, cookies, muffins, waffles, pancakes,pretzels, <br/>
 that we cook. I also add it to smoothies and milkshakes that we make, which <br/>
by  the way, we make with kefir instead of milk which is probiotic and tends <br/>
to help  move the intestines more regularly, which means that for some people <br/>
it tends to  be more binding, for others less binding.<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, just a thought,,,<br/>
