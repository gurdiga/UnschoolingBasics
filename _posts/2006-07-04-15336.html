<div id="ygrps-yiv-726515566">School is over and we are on vacation. We have two months before us, <br/>
now, and in September, if Sylvain doesn&#39;t want to go back to school, <br/>
well, he won&#39;t. <br/>
<br/>
For me, these two months are a bit like a test : let&#39;s see what <br/>
happens when I&#39;m left alone all day with my three kids - it has <br/>
never happened before : I&#39;ve always worked, at least part-time and <br/>
my two elder have spent their week at daycare. I&#39;m on leave since <br/>
Circ√© was born, on November, and I&#39;ll go back to University in <br/>
October, two days a week.<br/>
<br/>
But until then, I&#39;ll be with them all day ... and it&#39;s quite <br/>
difficult for me. I&#39;m so used to have some time by myself during the <br/>
day, and I realise that I need it very much - or at least, that I <br/>
don&#39;t know yet how to manage without these little moments alone. <br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s the 3rd day of vacation, and I haven&#39;t done so well yet. At <br/>
times, I simply cannot stand being needed so much ... and I hate <br/>
myself for my poor reactions. And of course, I&#39;m quite worried for <br/>
the future (though I&#39;m trying not to focus on that, but on the <br/>
moment ...)<br/>
<br/>
There is another problem ... how do you do when your energy level is <br/>
completely down ? I let them do quite whatever they want, and at <br/>
some point, I feel that I should do something, take them with me <br/>
somewhere, initiate a game, whatever, but change the energy of the <br/>
moment, because they get bored ... and I can&#39;t. The hot weather <br/>
(though I know it&#39;s not an excuse) doesn&#39;t help me, because I really <br/>
hate that, it really gets on my nerves, I know it, I do my best to <br/>
overcome this, but my best isn&#39;t enough sometimes ... so, I said it <br/>
doesn&#39;t help, because I don&#39;t want to go out during the afternoon. <br/>
So we spend our mornings in our (tiny) garden, then we flow back <br/>
inside, close everything and wait for the sun to turn - and at five, <br/>
we live again. <br/>
<br/>
Is there any secret trick to find the energy to do things when you <br/>
just feel like laying down on the floor ?<br/>
<br/>
I guess that living with kids all day when you&#39;re not used to that <br/>
rythm is, like anything else, an apprenticeship and that, in theory, <br/>
I&#39;ll do better next week than this one, but I must say that I&#39;m <br/>
suddenly feeling a bit frightened : and if I wasn&#39;t able to <br/>
unschool ? What if I wasn&#39;t &quot;maternal&quot; enough ? I really do love my <br/>
kids, and I really like spending time with them and watching them <br/>
spending time together and bringing up things, really ... but I&#39;ve <br/>
been such a poor companion these days ...<br/>
<br/>
I hope it is just a phase<br/>
Thanks for reading me anyway<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1538222351">OK. So here I am, trying to do better everyday (baby steps, though).<br/>
<br/>
The cool thing is, when I sit in front of my computer, I always find <br/>
food for thought, allowing me to put the events of the day in <br/>
perspective :) Sometimes, it is incredibly to the point !!!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway. I have a concern, which I tried to express in my previous <br/>
message, with my elementary English that make the exercise of <br/>
translating my thoughts such a hard and frustrating exercise ... I <br/>
hope that nobody won&#39;t be irritated by my insistance <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about being WITH my children. I have a lot of questions around <br/>
that. <br/>
<br/>
As I said, I&#39;m really not used to live like that - I know how to <br/>
live separate lives, I&#39;m used to separation in the morning and <br/>
reunion in the evening, used to do my own business during the day, <br/>
living at my own rhythm ... I know how to put things aside in order <br/>
to take care of my children when they are here, how to give them my <br/>
full attention when we are together, evenings and week-ends<br/>
<br/>
Though it is really what I want (I hated leaving them every <br/>
morning),  I don&#39;t know how to live together day after day after <br/>
day - I&#39;m so lost ! <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always needed to have time by myself - and suddenly I don&#39;t <br/>
have any, and I miss it very much. Strangely, in the same time, I&#39;m <br/>
having doubts : is it really a need by itself, or is it hiding <br/>
another one ? <br/>
<br/>
I try to preserve some little times for me during the day, but the <br/>
outcome of this attitude is &quot;disastrous&quot;, because it doesn&#39;t work, <br/>
of course, and I&#39;m kind of frustrated all the time (and I guess that <br/>
they are, too). I really have a hard time going to them - it&#39;s as if <br/>
I was trying to escape all the time. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering if they finally don&#39;t have less time WITH me than <br/>
before.<br/>
<br/>
I have also noticed that they get bored and electric when we don&#39;t <br/>
regularly do organized things together ... The balance between <br/>
proposing activities and letting them organize their own time is <br/>
difficult to find, particularly when I&#39;m very tired or longing for <br/>
solitude. On the other hand, I don&#39;t really know what to propose ! <br/>
They made lots of things at daycare, and my role was to let them <br/>
free of their time, so they could rest from all this &quot;collective <br/>
organisation&quot; ...  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering : will it always be like that ? Am I experiencing a <br/>
transition time, getting accustomed to a new pattern of life ? Am I <br/>
going to learn being with my kids all the time, balancing our needs, <br/>
initiating things, sensing when they need a little help from me <br/>
through their day and when they need me to leave them alone ? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;m redundant with my previous message, sorry of being <br/>
so confused and talkative - but I&#39;m actuallly looking for help :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1131446589">Hi Helen,<br/>
<br/>
I have the same kind of feelings and I feel them the strongest in the<br/>
morning, after waking up. &quot;Oh mai.... what should I do today with the<br/>
kids...??&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I see that this has nothing to do with the kids. It is my perspective of my<br/>
life.. I can see that my brains start right away with telling me about all<br/>
the things that must be done and when I don&#39;t listen to that, I feel scared<br/>
and tense.... I feel the struggle and tension in my body which I feel all my<br/>
life, when I am lost, out of connection with my heart, my breath...<br/>
<br/>
I feel devastated but there is nothing really wrong.. My brains give me the<br/>
wrong information... they act as if there is an emergency but the real thing<br/>
is.. all is well... Jesse is at home for almost a year now and I am still<br/>
working on this issue. You are not alone..<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>

<br/>
***First of all, recognize you are just at the beginning of the long <br/>
process of deschooling.  Next year at this time, if you keep making <br/>
progress, you will just be starting to truly &quot;unschool&quot; - so give <br/>
yourself a break and realize it is a process - a long process. <br/>
<br/>
 My recommendation to you is to drop all the &quot;shoulds&quot;.  Every time you <br/>
feel like you &quot;should&quot; do something, but you don&#39;t really feel like it <br/>
(whether because of energy levels or whatever), then don&#39;t do it!  <br/>
Deschooling at this point is about learning to honor your self, your <br/>
energy levels.  Do what you want to do, not what you feel you should do <br/>
or feel that you have to do.  If you can&#39;t do that for yourself, how <br/>
will you ever do it for your children?  Unschooling is about trusting <br/>
and honoring the desires/rhythyms of ourselves and our children.  Keep <br/>
reminding yourself you are on summer break - you are taking a break from <br/>
everything. <br/>
<br/>
So, if you want to lay around, lay around!  If you can&#39;t bring yourself <br/>
to clean the house or feel resistance every time you think &quot;I should <br/>
clean the house&quot; than don&#39;t do it.  What do you feel like doing?  What <br/>
do the kids feel like doing?  Do those things.  You are probably all <br/>
exhausted from pushing yourselves when you should have been resting and <br/>
now you will need a long break to catch up.  Begin unschooling by <br/>
honoring that; by ignoring all the &quot;shoulds&quot; that keep echoing around in <br/>
your head and do what you feel like doing.<br/>
<br/>
My guess is that you feel like your children are exhausting you because <br/>
you are not honoring what you need and what they need.  It is exhuasting <br/>
to push/control people constantly.  You are probably not even aware that <br/>
you are doing it - it has become so second nature to you that you are <br/>
unaware that it is happening.  I fall into this trap too, and my biggest <br/>
indication that it is happening again is when my energy levels drop and <br/>
I feel like I am dragging everyone along.  When this happens, I know I <br/>
am &quot;going against the grain&quot; and I need to give myself a time-out.  And <br/>
I usually need to drop my expectations about what &quot;should&quot; be happening. <br/>
<br/>
Your time with your children should be enjoyable.  What are you pushing <br/>
yourself to do with them that feels like such a drain?  Are you laughing <br/>
and having fun together?  Are you cuddling in bed and reading to them?  <br/>
Are you letting them lead the activities or are you organizing <br/>
activities and making them do it?  Having some time to yourself is fine <br/>
but I get the impression from your letter that your time with your <br/>
children is not enjoyable, not nourishing and therefore you have to take <br/>
breaks or avoid it, if possible.  That tells me something is wrong with <br/>
how you and your children are interacting.  Tell us some more about what <br/>
goes on and what specifically it is about your children that bothers you <br/>
and that you feel you need to avoid.<br/>

I found this morning the word that describes how I feel these days <br/>
(though I don&#39;t know if the translation is correct) : desynchronized.<br/>

Gotta go, dogs are waiting ;)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and that you feel you need to avoid.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, that&#39;s what bothers me so much. Usually, I like being with <br/>
them, following their games, reading them stories ... But I don&#39;t <br/>
know why, this week, it&#39;s not at all like this. Maybe it&#39;s because <br/>
I&#39;m not used to spend my whole day with somebody (I&#39;m a rather <br/>
solitary person), and it&#39;s hard for me to take other habits ... <br/>
Maybe it&#39;s because I find hard to be on call, like that, all day <br/>
long ... Maybe it&#39;s the fact of being the only person in charge - I <br/>
guess that there must be a little bit of that, because I can feel <br/>
the tension go when my husband comes back - even when he does <br/>
nothing but reading the paper ... <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I don&#39;t know why, all I&#39;m thinking of is &quot;getting a little <br/>
space for me&quot; ... I try to control that, I think : you were so sad <br/>
leaving them all the time, and you&#39;ll see, before you even know it, <br/>
they&#39;ll leave home, enjoy while they&#39;re here ... They won&#39;t always <br/>
need you so much and you&#39;ll even miss the constant interruptions ... <br/>
<br/>
I have the feeling they would like me to initiate things, but I <br/>
don&#39;t know what to do with them : I love reading stories, I love <br/>
discussing with them, I love going with them ... anywhere, the fact <br/>
of being together ... I&#39;m not so good in playing with toys (I mean : <br/>
I can have a great fun playing in the pool, jumping, splashing, all <br/>
these, but give me a Playmobil soldier and I suddenly feel goofy and <br/>
stupid ...). I&#39;m not very good in being there just in case, when <br/>
Sylvain plays with the computer, for instance, and asks for help <br/>
again and again ... <br/>
<br/>
Yes, I think that&#39;s the most difficult for me is to be there, at <br/>
their disposal, and knowing that I can&#39;t do anything for me, whether <br/>
it is for my pleasure or because it needs to be done, because I know <br/>
that I&#39;ll be interrupted again and again ... I also know that it <br/>
would be better if I were truly with them, instead of being half <br/>
there, half thinking of my various to-do lists ... but I can&#39;t help <br/>
it (yet)<br/>
<br/>
I feel quite depressed today, because when I began to read you (and <br/>
Sandra and Joyce&#39;s sites), it really had an impact in my ways with <br/>
the kids, I really felt more patient and relaxed ... and now that I <br/>
do have time, I&#39;m stressed out again, and I yell again ... IT&#39;s as <br/>
if I had too much responsibilities and I don&#39;t feel like I can do <br/>
it. This morning, as I burst into cries, hidden behind a wall of <br/>
toilet paper in the supermaket, I was thinking &quot;I shouldn&#39;t have all <br/>
these kids, I&#39;m not able to take care of them as they deserve, etc.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I often read here that we are work in progress, so let&#39;s hope in <br/>
progress ...<br/>

&gt; that I&#39;ll be interrupted again and again ...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This time will end! My kids are now 15, 18, and 21 and I just had to  <br/>
make a lunch date with my 21 year old in order to be sure I&#39;d even  <br/>
SEE her in the next week. It won&#39;t last - really!  I remember feeling  <br/>
the same way you do after I left my regular full-time employment to  <br/>
stay home with my little ones - I felt like my whole day went by with  <br/>
nothing &quot;done&quot; and like I&#39;d never get to do something satisfying to  <br/>
myself ever again. What I &quot;did&quot; about that was to get super into  <br/>
reading about child development and about learning and then I&#39;d keep  <br/>
my focus on my own kids - watching, observing them. I kept a journal  <br/>
- just jotted down little notes like: &quot;Rosie seems to be guessing  <br/>
what words are based on the first letter,&quot; or &quot;Roxana needs needs to  <br/>
be left alone when she&#39;s upset - not comforted immediately.&quot; Keeping  <br/>
a journal (even though it was sometimes 3 or 4 words in an entry  <br/>
because that&#39;s all the time I got) helped me feel more like something  <br/>
was &quot;happening&quot; while getting my focus more clearly on the kids - out  <br/>
of my own head. And - I always had a book going, but I had to learn  <br/>
to read in bits - not like how I read before, in long uninterrupted  <br/>
stretches. Nonfiction works way better for this than fiction - so  <br/>
there were about 18 years of me reading almost entirely nonfiction -  <br/>
until I got back into fiction a couple of years ago.<br/>
<br/>
Also - it REALLY helped to take the kids out of the house to a public  <br/>
area where there might be other parents. Even when my kids were  <br/>
school age and the other parents only had toddlers and babies, it  <br/>
gave me someone to talk to who understood how to carry on a  <br/>
conversation in the midst of constant interruption. Where I live, it  <br/>
is easy to start up a conversation with another parent - just stand  <br/>
watching the kids on the playground and say, &quot;Oh, your little boy is  <br/>
so cute - look how well he&#39;s climbing that ladder. How old is he?&quot;  <br/>
Parents here are open to conversations with other parents. I&#39;m not  <br/>
sure that is the case everywhere, I know in Germany people didn&#39;t  <br/>
seem to commonly talk to strangers in public settings like we do  <br/>
here. But, if that works where you are, it is a great way to have a  <br/>
little adult conversation during the day.  In rainy weather I&#39;d take  <br/>
the kids to a shopping mall just to buy a cookie and I&#39;d have a cup  <br/>
of coffee (that someone ELSE had made - it was a treat!).<br/>
<br/>
ALSO - I had a mother&#39;s helper - a teenage girl who came in and  <br/>
played with the kids while I was there, in the house, but went off to  <br/>
do my own thing for a while. I worked from home during some periods  <br/>
of time - other times I just went and took a bath and read a book in  <br/>
the tub. Sometimes I made phone calls. The time went fast - but I  <br/>
think even an hour or two a couple of times per week could make a  <br/>
HUGE difference.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I also know that it<br/>
&gt; would be better if I were truly with them, instead of being half<br/>
&gt; there, half thinking of my various to-do lists ... but I can&#39;t help<br/>
&gt; it (yet)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes you can - you can help it. You can do better for an hour, for  <br/>
example. You can tell yourself: &quot;For the next hour I&#39;m on vacation  <br/>
with my kids and we have nothing to do but have fun together.&quot; So do  <br/>
that for an hour. Then tell the kids, &quot;Okay, now I&#39;m on work time and  <br/>
won&#39;t be paying as much attention for the next hour.&quot; Alternate like  <br/>
that. What you end up with is half your time with full focus on the  <br/>
kids and half the time partially focused on them and partially on  <br/>
getting other stuff done. That&#39;s FINE! That&#39;s awesome!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sweetie - you don&#39;t get the luxury of self-pity (even if you deserve  <br/>
it). You do have kids and they need a happy mommy. So you do owe it  <br/>
to them to take care of yourself. Do you get enough sleep, eat well,  <br/>
get a little regular exercise? If you really are a little depressed,  <br/>
try St. John&#39;s Wort - it works great for mild to moderate depression.  <br/>
If you think you&#39;re seriously depressed please see a doctor - you can  <br/>
take an anti-depressant for a while, jump start yourself and begin  <br/>
feeling like having more fun in your life again, and pretty soon you  <br/>
might not need the medications. Also, I have a friend who goes out  <br/>
EVERY Friday night by herself or with girlfriends. She almost always  <br/>
goes to a movie - she picks artsy interesting movies that her husband  <br/>
probably wouldn&#39;t even want to see. She&#39;s done this every Friday  <br/>
night for probably 12 years or more. Would a night out help? Having  <br/>
something like that to look forward to this WEEK?<br/>
<br/>
I never liked to play &quot;Little People&quot; or dolls or any of that stuff  <br/>
with my kids. They could tell. So - occasionally I&#39;d be part of their  <br/>
play, but they&#39;d have to tell me what to do &lt;G&gt;. It wasn&#39;t that  <br/>
satisfying to any of us - they didn&#39;t ask it of me too often. But I  <br/>
did lots of other things with them. I don&#39;t think adults need to be  <br/>
watching kids play and cheering them on or anything - just be  <br/>
available, you don&#39;t have to be part of it all the time, or even most  <br/>
of the time.<br/>
<br/>
Think of things you might enjoy, yourself, that you could share with  <br/>
the kids. Get good quality finger paints and fingerpainting paper and  <br/>
YOU fingerpaint and invite them to join in. Same with watercolors. Or  <br/>
- buy a bunch of disposable cameras and all of you go out and take  <br/>
photos together of nature or city life or whatever. You get to  <br/>
participate at YOUR level, too, that way.<br/>
<br/>
Although you do have to get used to be interrupted all the time - and  <br/>
functioning that way is a skill you might not yet have -- you don&#39;t  <br/>
have to put ALL your attention on your kids to the point that you&#39;re  <br/>
feeling martyred - that&#39;s not even very good for them. Think of it as  <br/>
modeling an adult being interested in things, too.<br/>
<br/>
What are your hobbies? What would you like to do with yourself OTHER  <br/>
than clean the house and do laundry, etc.?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-191565345">I had to respond to this part of your original post:<br/>
&quot;So we spend our mornings in our (tiny) garden, then we flow back<br/>
inside, close everything and wait for the sun to turn - and at five,<br/>
we live again.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I could have written that but it would look more like:  So we spend<br/>
our springs in our (tiny) garden, then we flow back inside, close<br/>
everything and wait for the seasons to turn - and at autumn we live<br/>
again.&quot;  :-)  We are not summer people (so what the heck are we doing<br/>
living in  Florida?).  We joke (although it is mostly true) that we go<br/>
from air conditioned building to air conditioned car into a different<br/>
air conditioned building during the summer.  None of us truly enjoy<br/>
the heat, so we tend to hibernate during the summer and then go out to<br/>
play in the cooler months.  It doesn&#39;t help that poor Keon is horribly<br/>
allergic to misquitos and gets huge welts on him that make him look<br/>
like he has a perpetual case of chicken pox and that he is allergic to<br/>
grass.  Anytime someone cuts their grass in the neighborhood (which is<br/>
often) he has to stay inside for most of the day or he will get stuffy<br/>
and wheezy.  And people wonder why we don&#39;t water our grass and have<br/>
let it go dormant in this stupid draught.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Maybe it&#39;s the fact of being the only person in charge - I<br/>
&gt; guess that there must be a little bit of that, because I can feel<br/>
&gt; the tension go when my husband comes back - even when he does<br/>
&gt; nothing but reading the paper ...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I used to be like that.  In fact for a short while (even though I only<br/>
worked when Emily was a few months old and have been a SAHM since) I<br/>
actually waited for my co-parent to get home before doing *anything.*<br/>
It was like we waited for his arrival to begin our lives.  I got over<br/>
it by just being used to being alone with our children.  I think his<br/>
working out of town for weeks on end made me want to have a life.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, I don&#39;t know why, all I&#39;m thinking of is &quot;getting a little<br/>
&gt; space for me&quot; ...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When my children were much younger I would actually schedule &quot;me<br/>
time.&quot;  Whether it was just doing the grocery shopping alone or a<br/>
monthly or weekly craft class, I scheduled time for me.  I&#39;m an<br/>
important part of the family as well.  I did this even when our babies<br/>
were small because I learned their schedules and knew that I could be<br/>
away from them for 1.5-3 hours here and there.  For a while I was<br/>
taking myself to the movies and going to the showings that started at<br/>
9:30 or 10:00 at night because I knew our baby would be in his long<br/>
slumber at that time and not wake up.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I have the feeling they would like me to initiate things, but I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know what to do with them : I love reading stories, I love<br/>
&gt; discussing with them, I love going with them ... anywhere, the fact<br/>
&gt; of being together ... I&#39;m not so good in playing with toys (I mean :<br/>
&gt; I can have a great fun playing in the pool, jumping, splashing, all<br/>
&gt; these, but give me a Playmobil soldier and I suddenly feel goofy and<br/>
&gt; stupid ...).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s ok to feel goofy and silly (I doubt you are stupid :) )  That&#39;s<br/>
what play is.  Laugh, enjoy, be silly!  All too soon they are going to<br/>
be dressing in black and only be concerned with serious things like<br/>
the Korean missile testing and why the heck the Jews and Muslems can&#39;t<br/>
get along in Israel and why the environment is going to hell in a hand<br/>
basket.  Enjoy this goofy silly time!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m not very good in being there just in case, when<br/>
&gt; Sylvain plays with the computer, for instance, and asks for help<br/>
&gt; again and again ...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When Keon first started getting on the computer he had problems<br/>
reading URL&#39;s to type them in.  To help him with this and to also<br/>
limit his accidentally ending up at a website that featured nude<br/>
Disney characters doing things I didn&#39;t think he was quite ready for<br/>
at 3 years old LOL!  I created shortcuts for him on the desktop so he<br/>
could click on an icon and go straight to Disney, or Hotwheels or<br/>
Neopets.  All his user names and passwords were the same and written<br/>
on a 3x5 card that was taped to the computer.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Yes, I think that&#39;s the most difficult for me is to be there, at<br/>
&gt; their disposal, and knowing that I can&#39;t do anything for me, whether<br/>
&gt; it is for my pleasure or because it needs to be done, because I know<br/>
&gt; that I&#39;ll be interrupted again and again ... I also know that it<br/>
&gt; would be better if I were truly with them, instead of being half<br/>
&gt; there, half thinking of my various to-do lists ... but I can&#39;t help<br/>
&gt; it (yet)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is all new to you.  Give yourself time and if you get interupted,<br/>
know that that task will still be there when you are finished playing<br/>
with your kids.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I often read here that we are work in progress, so let&#39;s hope in<br/>
&gt; progress ...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We are always a work in progress.  We are always on a journey.  if the<br/>
work gets completed or the journey completed, there won&#39;t be anything<br/>
worth living for.  Sure would be boring without all the self-discovery<br/>
and adventures!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1283400872">Michelle and Pam, thank you so much for your answers ...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad to see that I&#39;m not the only one who estivate (the word <br/>
exists : in the Sahara desert, little mice spend the whole summer <br/>
buried into the sand, waiting for a more clement season) !<br/>
<br/>
My husband came home and I left to walk the dogs. While I was <br/>
walking in the countryside, watching the beautiful changing sky, I <br/>
felt the tension leaving my body. I realised that during the day, I <br/>
get more and more tensed, and suddenly, I explode for a little <br/>
incident ... I was wondering if there were a way to relax physically <br/>
in order to avoid these outbursts ...  (though I don&#39;t know, between <br/>
the physical tension and the mental one which is the hen and which <br/>
is the egg ...)<br/>
<br/>
I guess that the problem is the shift from segmented/specialised <br/>
times to the more organic/intertwined life I&#39;m experiencing now. I <br/>
have to find new marks. By reading your posts, I realise that I am <br/>
such a beginner in this new life, that this is something so<br/>
different (not only the radical unschooling thing, but also <br/>
the &quot;living together&quot; one), that this is not surprising if I <br/>
feel lost and not good at it ... <br/>
<br/>
Pam, I really liked the way you told me that I couldn&#39;t afford self-<br/>
pity - it was so empowering ! I absolutely agree with you. I&#39;m not <br/>
depressed, actually, I usually feel very privileged and happy, but <br/>
yesterday, I was this miserable little thing who &quot;didn&#39;t even know <br/>
what to cook for luhuhuhunch&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
I wrote about it, because I have moments like this from time to <br/>
time, though they&#39;re only moments, where I feel at loss and <br/>
overwhelmed by the huge responsibility of being a parent ... but I <br/>
notice that it happens mostly when I loose touch with my children <br/>
(which was very the case yesterday). <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one of the reasons why I like so much the way you, radical <br/>
unschoolers, talk about parenting. When I read you, it really feel <br/>
like : yes, this is truth. And the reason why I feel that is not <br/>
that I&#39;m inclined to follow a new guru - it is because what you say <br/>
speaks directly to the life in me (what I tried to translate once <br/>
by &quot;talking to my cells&quot;), the part which has remained undamaged and <br/>
which is constantly seeking for healing forces. <br/>
<br/>
But this is also why I felt so strange this week, because on the one <br/>
hand, I read words which were driving me in the right track (sorry <br/>
for the image, cannot find my words to express what I really felt <br/>
here) and on the other hand, there was something (what ???) <br/>
resisting in me, which makes me act in complete contradiction with <br/>
my beliefs - at the moment where my beliefs where so much reinforced <br/>
by my readings. (Does anybody understand what I&#39;m writing here ?)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not looking for excuses, I&#39;m trying to understand what&#39;s going <br/>
on in me :) Ren said in another post that unschooling was such a <br/>
healing process, and I really think that too - but I&#39;m always <br/>
surprised (though it is not the first time) with the resistance and <br/>
fights such a process encounters.<br/>
<br/>
Many, many thanks. I really appreciate your bluntness AND <br/>
kindness - and also all these practical, down to the earth pieces of <br/>
advice you give, which are sooo helpful ? useful ? don&#39;t know, but <br/>
priceless anyway :)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We have all gone through it. I took to unschooling instantly - &quot;got  <br/>
it&quot; - knew it was right, knew it was what we&#39;d do. It felt natural to  <br/>
me - it was a logical and easy extension of the way I&#39;d been raised  <br/>
and the way I&#39;d lived with my babies and toddlers.<br/>
<br/>
But STILL I resort to yelling and guilt-inducing and sometimes get so  <br/>
frustrated and angry that I say things I thoroughly regret. Each new  <br/>
age of kids (and adults) - each new stage - brings new challenges and  <br/>
we have new things to learn about ourselves and how we react.<br/>
<br/>
What has helped me is this:  In the midst of reacting in a way I  <br/>
really don&#39;t want to act, a little voice in my head says, &quot;Think of  <br/>
two options first.&quot; What that means is that I&#39;m telling myself to not  <br/>
react until I&#39;m choosing the best of at least two possible reactions.  <br/>
So - I quickly think - &quot;YELL!&quot; because that is what is about to come  <br/>
out, and then I think &quot;OR ......&quot; - and I force myself to think of  <br/>
something else. Often, that much of a pause is enough to get me to  <br/>
think of what someone on this list has previously suggested - hug,  <br/>
touch, breathe, etc. So I choose the better of the two alternatives.  <br/>
EVEN if my urge is to throw something and the only other alternative  <br/>
I can think of is to slam a door - slamming a door is a better  <br/>
alternative (usually). It is a PROCESS - and getting the habit of  <br/>
choosing between at least two options is a HUGE big step in that  <br/>
process - if that can become a habit, then you&#39;ll find that you start  <br/>
to choose between better and better options.<br/>
