unschoolers but just became aware of it in the past year! :) I go to<br/>
school full time (which is only 13 hours a week, and we have an<br/>

narrowing it down to one topic I can cover in 8-10 pages, but I think<br/>
I have got it. One of the questions I have had to answer about<br/>
unschooling is,&quot; If you let your children do whatever they want, won&#39;t<br/>
they just run over you? Run wild?&quot; I think that this question is<br/>
rooted in alot of things, but mostly the societal fear of anarchy, and<br/>
the fear that people are inherently bad. So I would like to hear some<br/>
experiences of the effects of freedom on children, some opinions about<br/>
why it is that this freedom works for and not against us. If you don&#39;t<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1251491549">Hey Natalie,<br/>
  Interesting subject to try to keep to 8-10 pages, lol.  I&#39;m new to the group so should probably keep my mouth shut.  I guess I actually do a combination of styles, mostly unschooling, but with my son (8) it&#39;s easy.  We started this year (first official full year of HS) trying to follow the pre-printed guidelines.  Lol, that lasted like....not even a day?  Who wants to be chained to a desk for even one hour let alone four plus?<br/>
   <br/>
  I say my son&#39;s easy because he reads at a very high level.  His vocabulary is large.  He&#39;s one of those kids, that if you explain it right, gets it.  I love books so the house has always been filled with them. Recently, I find that to answer his questions, my A&P books from college are being pulled out. Glad I kept them.<br/>
   <br/>
  Now, as for the &quot;let them do whatever they want&quot;....hummmm.<br/>
  We live on a farm, so it has never been quite like that.  Life has choices.  Don&#39;t feed the pets, the pets die.  Choice would fall more to WHEN to feed the pets, not IF.  Never love your pony, don&#39;t get made when she doesn&#39;t want to come to you.  (Happy to report all the pets are happy and well loved.)  <br/>
   <br/>
  School for us has fallen into the same mode.  Surprisingly, my son&#39;s weakest subject, writing, has blossomed taking this approach.  Instead of having him do the pre-scripted copy work he has no interest in, I just suggest he add a new chapter to his novel as I can&#39;t wait to hear what happens next.  This technic is actually creating a novel!  Well, that&#39;s my story.  Hope it helps.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If the rules are taken away or mom and dad leave for the weekend and  <br/>
there&#39;s no one to enforce the rules then, it&#39;s true, some kids do go  <br/>
wild.<br/>
<br/>
If there are no rules and parents aren&#39;t there -- too busy, don&#39;t  <br/>
care, ineffectual (they say &quot;Don&#39;t ... stop ...&quot; but it&#39;s just a buzz  <br/>
to the kids) -- to help kids understand the results of their actions,  <br/>
kids are often nasty and wild.<br/>
<br/>
It really all seems like the only thing that keeps chaos is check is  <br/>
rules.<br/>
<br/>
But what&#39;s lacking in all those typical parenting scenarios is  <br/>
parental engagement, involvement and partnership. Rules make parents  <br/>
feel like they&#39;re involved in their children&#39;s lives but really they  <br/>
say &quot;I don&#39;t like who you are. This is who I want you to be.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a huge difference between &quot;do whatever you want&quot; and being  <br/>
there to help a child get what they want.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a huge difference between letting a child drain a mother dry  <br/>
and being honest about our limitations, such as, &quot;Let&#39;s put that on  <br/>
the list for tomorrow because I&#39;ve reached my limit.&quot; *And then  <br/>
following through so the child knows the mom&#39;s word can be trusted.*<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a huge difference between punishing a child for kicking and  <br/>
punching another and, in order of effectiveness,:<br/>
<br/>
1) being aware enough of the child&#39;s internal state to avoid normal  <br/>
triggers (like hunger, excessive stiimulation, tiredness) that might  <br/>
result in kicking and punching,<br/>
<br/>
2) being aware enough of what&#39;s going on to defuse situations before  <br/>
they get to the point of kicking and punching,<br/>
<br/>
3) stopping kicking and punching, helping the injured child, help the  <br/>
kids work out a better solution and/or fix what was wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than &quot;No rules&quot; a better way of stating it is being engaged  <br/>
with our kids and helping them get what they want. Gaining their  <br/>
trust that we&#39;re there to help them get what they want in life in  <br/>
ways that are safe and respectful of others means there isn&#39;t a  <br/>
reason to &quot;Go wild&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve written a lot about it at:<br/>

The stuff on the right is probably most relevant. Not sure if it can  <br/>
easily be condensed into 8-10 pages ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-762697979">We&#39;re new to unschooling, but I can say that I&#39;ve lived it. The  <br/>
radical unschooling DOES work, as long as the parent&#39;s are involved  <br/>
and loving parts of the child&#39;s life. When I&#39;m distracted, the little  <br/>
ones have only one way to get my attention. I don&#39;t even see it as  <br/>
running wild, it&#39;s a desperate call for attention.<br/>
<br/>
I think one thing that was pointed out to me (over and over until I  <br/>
got it) was that WHY do people assume the worst? If I don&#39;t *make* my  <br/>
kids feed the animals, they would just LET THEM STARVE. If I don&#39;t  <br/>
*make* them clean their rooms, they would get so dirty WE&#39;D HAVE  <br/>
ROACHES AND RATS eating out of them. Well, my arguments to those  <br/>
would be, why would your kids let the animals starve? Because they  <br/>
are &#39;malicious little brats&#39; (which seems to be mainstreamers view),  <br/>
or because they are still young enough they need reminders/assistance/ <br/>
encouragement? I&#39;ve seen my children forget over and over to feed the  <br/>
animals, but when we sat down to dinner, they remembered that their  <br/>
animal friends might be hungry too. Or just me asking when they were  <br/>
fed last (because I wanted to know and do it myself, not to be nasty  <br/>
and try to get them to do it) We&#39;re partners in the house, not  <br/>
dominator and subjects. Same for their rooms. Cleaning is important  <br/>
to me, but really, what&#39;s in it for the kids? Not much really, all it  <br/>
means is to take time out of their play to put away the reminders of  <br/>
fun they&#39;ve had. When I clean their rooms as a gift, as a clean slate  <br/>
for them to start their fun anew, it&#39;s an example to them of how it  <br/>
can be okay. And about half the time, they join in because they want  <br/>
to. When guests are coming over, and I say &quot;Guy&#39;s, so-n-so will be  <br/>
here soon, and I really need your help tidying rooms x, y, z, can you  <br/>
help?&quot; they jump on it because cleaning doesn&#39;t have the unpleasant  <br/>
associations that it probably does for most of us.<br/>
<br/>
I gotta go, i&#39;m sure there was more to say, but I&#39;ve got a 5yo and  <br/>
3yo who need me to throw them on the bed to jump. :-) My parents  <br/>
might say that they run wild, but really, what&#39;s the harm in it?<br/>

question.  Unschooling parents are mindful, present, interactive,<br/>
engaging.  They aren&#39;t sitting on the sidelines waiting for their<br/>
children to cause chaos.  Neglectful inattentive parents will have<br/>
children that &quot;run wild&quot; but unschooling mindful parents will be<br/>
running wildly with their children embracing all life has to offer!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1258123911">Hello Natalie...<br/>
<br/>
Welcome. :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If you let your children do whatever they want, won&#39;t they just <br/>
 </span></blockquote>run over you? Run wild?&quot;So I would like to hear some experiences of <br/>
the effects of freedom on children, some opinions about why it is <br/>
that this freedom works for and not against us. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Let me tell you about my kids...<br/>
<br/>
We adopted siblings...two girls and a boy. At the time of the <br/>
adoption they were 5, 8 & 11 and had been in foster care for four <br/>
years. These were children that had NO freedom and NO choice in <br/>
their lives. When my kids came to us, they had been limited and <br/>
controlled in every area of their lives. They had no &quot;real life&quot; <br/>
skills because they were never given the chance to choose for <br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
In the almost three years that we adopted them they have healed (and <br/>
continue to do so) and we have experienced many, many positive <br/>
effects from them having freedom over their lives.<br/>
<br/>
My youngest just turned 8 last month and has complete control over <br/>
areas such as food, computer and playstation. It was a process <br/>
getting here...I started by saying yes more and more, talking with <br/>
her about the choices she was making and answering any questions <br/>
that she had honestly. My feeling is...if they&#39;re never given a <br/>
choice, how can they choose what&#39;s right? <br/>
<br/>
I blog about our lives and our journey if you&#39;re interested. Here&#39;s <br/>
