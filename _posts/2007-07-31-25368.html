Karen&#39;s  now asking advice on how to deal with a  <br/>
tradtionally-parented-teen-gone-wild. That&#39;s *very* hard for us to give  <br/>
advice or suggestions for because we advocate starting as early as  <br/>
possible to develop the trust that is obviously lacking in her case.  <br/>
It&#39;s not that she *can&#39;t* regain/build trust---it&#39;s just that that is  <br/>
EXACTLY what we are trying to avoid with our foundation-laying right  <br/>
now!<br/>
<br/>
I would even venture to say that it&#39;s a lot like deschooling:  Karen&#39;s <br/>
daughter will need one month for every year she has been  &quot;traditionally <br/>
parented&quot; in order to &quot;de-parent&quot; completely. It&#39;s sooo  much easier to <br/>
start out that way OR start while the child is still  youngish.<br/>
<br/>

yes, and what i did, was NOT follow my heart with her - i was an 18 year  old <br/>
mama that had some great experiences in Montessori but not with parents that  <br/>
knew how to fight for me. Oh, they loved the hoopla out of me and still do, <br/>
and  think I&#39;m making interesting and good choices for the kids, but they were  <br/>
fear-based. And so when Laura came, I was bullied into public schools and all <br/>
 the bs that went with it. <br/>
 <br/>
I hope I can deschool her to some extent...I left out LOTS of the story,  <br/>
like her early years, my depression and ED and some of my wild, immature times  <br/>
that she was around for. *I* think she mainly is angry (in general)  at both <br/>
myself and her father (I in fact think it&#39;s more directed at Todd,  her dad, but <br/>
I&#39;m the mom and I get more of the poo as a result - again,  traditional and <br/>
conventional stuff causing this teen anger and self  destruction. I also think <br/>
she is depressed, as it runs on both sides of the  family and it fits in many <br/>
ways, but that is neither here nor there - I&#39;m  waiting to read the replies to <br/>
e and doing all the &quot;snarky&quot; posts first,  lol!) and all those years of <br/>
convention are indeed biting back! <br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, my point is YES! I agree! Starting from the beginning (though I  have <br/>
always been unconventional, nursed her for nearly 4 years, co slept a good  <br/>
bit, &quot;allowed her&quot; dessert first and tried to be as restrictless as possible -  <br/>
boy the troubles I got from her paternal side! oh, boy! But if ONLY I knew <br/>
more  when her school refusal began...I wish so badly I knew more then, but I <br/>
can&#39;t go  back, only forwards...anyway......that&#39;s where I am and have been with <br/>
the 2  youngest and I see improvements with the other 2 oldest. I think <br/>
people are  scared to trust their kids, no doubt about it. <br/>
 <br/>
Obviously I took my personal stuff from this, lol, but I really should have  <br/>
said, &quot;Yes, I agree!&quot; lol! <br/>
 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2016468793">Karen, <br/>
  You know depression was my first thought when you related how your<br/>
daughter can&#39;t seem to finish things, can&#39;t keep a job, won&#39;t do<br/>
things around the house etc.   I have known other parents that have<br/>
felt they had to take similar actions that you have taken.   I think<br/>
that you have to weigh her needs against the rest of the<br/>
family..there&#39;s a whole family there that each need their needs<br/>
honored as well.   When you have one person bent on destruction and<br/>
the whole atmosphere of trust and peace is disrupted by that person<br/>
you just have to find a solution that honors as many of those<br/>
individuals as possible.   Your daughter was not operating in a<br/>
respectful, peaceful way so including her in your household was not<br/>
working for any of you.   Hopefully by you taking this stand that she<br/>
must respect the needs of others to have her own needs met it will<br/>
give her the kick in the pants she needs (not a literal kick in the<br/>
pants but a wake up call... a figurative kick in the pants)   I have<br/>
knew teens in the same position when I was a teen and in their later<br/>
years they realized that their parent did what they felt they needed<br/>
to to protect the rest of the family...perhaps they were bringing<br/>
drugs or dangerous people into the home around younger children,<br/>
perhaps they were stealing from family members.   Your daughter sounds<br/>
like she is really struggling with alot of issues... I know you said<br/>
that finances were a big factor ... perhaps you can find a gentle<br/>
counselor that can help you two work out the relationship and sort out<br/>
some parameters in which the two of you could live.    If this was<br/>
your only child you know and we all know that you would have dealt<br/>
with it differently but there are others to be considered.   I wish I<br/>
knew some alternative choice you could have made that would not sit so<br/>
heavily on your heart... I am not sure there is one.   You sound so<br/>
broken about it... perhaps you could write to your daughter and let<br/>
her know how difficult this decision was for you and how broken<br/>
hearted you are that this was the decision you felt was your only<br/>
solution.  Sometimes kids in that situation feel that they were just<br/>
thrown out without any thought and that the parent doesn&#39;t really care<br/>
and that&#39;s why it was so &quot;easy&quot; for you to just throw them out...<br/>
knowing that it was so hard might help open some communication.   <br/>
Your only solution in the meantime is to love her through it!<br/>
I wish I had some great solve all your problems advice but I don&#39;t!<br/>
Please know we are all thinking about you and your daughter and hoping<br/>
she will understand that the things parents do come from a place of<br/>
love for ALL of their children.<br/>
