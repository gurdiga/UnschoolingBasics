<div id="ygrps-yiv-755972782">The roots and shoots sounds like a great group!  I just wanted to say that I <br/>
was in 4-H growing up and maybe it was just the group we were a part of, but <br/>
it was really laid back.  Everyone participated in just what they wanted to and <br/>
could try out different activities and stop if they decided it wasn&#39;t fun.  <br/>
My family was mostly in to the animals.  We did show at the county fair, but my <br/>
family and group didn&#39;t focus on the ribbons or winning anything so it wasn&#39;t <br/>
about that for us.  There were no badges or anything like that.  It was a <br/>
great way to explore many different activities and experience lots of different <br/>
things.  I had a great time doing it.  As I said, I don&#39;t know if my group was <br/>
unique in that it was so laid back and wasn&#39;t focused on winning or badges, <br/>
but I thought I would share.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1161456220">&quot;If you could get a whole club full of unschoolers, I can imagine that would  <br/>
be one awesome club.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easy...you just have your meetings during weekdays, before school is out!:) That&#39;s how our 4-H club handled it and we had all homeschoolers even though it is technically open to anyone.<br/>
The amount of focus on awards is really all about who is leading your club. It can be very laid back if you wish. That&#39;s my experience with 4-H.<br/>

Oh, I meant UNschoolers.  :)<br/>
 <br/>
We had homeschoolers, but we&#39;re short on unschoolers around here.<br/>
 <br/>
I was VERY flexible and laid back, for sure.<br/>
