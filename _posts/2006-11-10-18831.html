<div id="ygrps-yiv-161557467">My son DOES want to go to community college at age 16 (of his own<br/>

choose from, we just want them happy.  I suppose deep down there is a<br/>
little fear that in four years from now he&#39;ll say, &quot;Thanks for nothing<br/>
Mom.  You put my education on my shoulders and told me that I didn&#39;t<br/>
have to write, read, do math and now I want to go to college and this<br/>
stuff is too hard to learn.&quot;  The fear is having my children blame me<br/>
if they ever do want to go to college and for some reason, they are<br/>
disappointed in me as their mother for not properly preparing them. <br/>
KWIM?  <br/>

Maybe some of you who have overcome that can give me some words of<br/>
wisdom.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Deschool deschool deschool deschool.  I can&#39;t say that enough.  YOU<br/>
may not have said that college was the end all be all of life, but<br/>
somewhere he got that notion.  I remember in the past you had concerns<br/>
about your son wanting to take his GED at a very young age and go to<br/>
college.  Yet what is his ultimate goal?  College just for college&#39;s<br/>
sake is not going to fulfill him.  You have many years yet to concern<br/>
yourself with his college &quot;needs&quot; and that&#39;s a lot of years of<br/>
deschooling and unschooling and for him to accept that he can make<br/>
choices in his life.  This current choice is still based on some<br/>
schoolish notion most likely.  Also, if I am recalling correctly,<br/>
didn&#39;t your son want to go to college to prove himself somehow to his<br/>
father?  I&#39;m wondering if that is still a major factor in his thought<br/>
process and until that relationship is working better in an<br/>
unschooling environment this may continue to be an issue.<br/>
<br/>
What is it that your son wants out of college other than to go?  Does<br/>
he have a grand goal in mind?  A future Doogie Howser or the youngest<br/>
Harvard Business grad?  :)  Is he already focused on his adult life<br/>
that he has forgotten how to be a kid?  Is childhood such a bad place<br/>
to be that he has to hurry up and become an adult?  Or is he just<br/>
anxious to be a veterinarian or concert pianist or playwright?  :)<br/>
Give him time (lots of time) to deschool and talk in terms of today,<br/>
here, now, this moment.<br/>

<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, you recalled correctly and that very well could be an underlying<br/>
issue as to why he still wants to go.  <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL, no although he did want to be a doctor for a bit when he took<br/>
interest in lung cancer because many of our relatives have died of<br/>
lunch cancer.  Then he found out that he has a millionaire doctor for<br/>
a Great Uncle and he got all excited about the financial aspect of<br/>
being a doctor but that passed and that is fine.<br/>
<br/>
Is he already focused on his adult life<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I never thought about that being one of the reasons and I&#39;ll ask him<br/>
about that and we&#39;ll try to refocus.  <br/>
<br/>
 Give him time (lots of time) to deschool and talk in terms of today,<br/>

deschool as well.  I just read an article by Alison McKee about<br/>
unschooling and college, it really helped.  <br/>

do something he isn&#39;t passionate about can have the opposite effect.  <br/>
He might decide that he wants nothing to do with college because he&#39;s  <br/>
associating it with the prodding. It&#39;s why nagging doesn&#39;t work. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is it possible to study for a few months prior and<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s possible to set your mind on a goal and do what&#39;s necessary to  <br/>
reach that goal. Yes, kids have decided they want to go to college  <br/>
and gone through formal math in a few months.<br/>
<br/>
It might be more helpful, *when he&#39;s ready* to take community college  <br/>
courses for fun. Forget about the preparation courses. Let him find  <br/>
reasons to keep exploring. And then if college looks like it might be  <br/>
helpful in getting him where he wants to go, then he&#39;ll be motivated  <br/>
to do what he needs to do.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ready by age 16<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It will also be helpful to let go of that deadline.  If a certain  <br/>
date is making the pressure build inside of him, he&#39;s more likely to  <br/>
focus on how much he hates the pressure than focusing on being happy  <br/>
and exploring what interests him.<br/>

<br/>
   My son DOES want to go to community college at age 16 (of his own<br/>
volition yet he hates to read books (he &quot;reads&quot; all the time playing<br/>
computer games, browsing articles, etc.) and hates doing math, doesn&#39;t<br/>
hardly remember grammar,etc... and I do not blame him after what he<br/>
has been through.  Given that, here is my question:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Before I get to *your* question, answer mine:<br/>
<br/>
*WHY* does he want to go t o community college?<br/>
<br/>
-=-==-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
If I never say a word, and I don&#39;t say, &quot;You know if you &#39;really&#39; want<br/>
to go to college, you should study on how to do paper math as well as<br/>
mental and learn grammar terminology and vocabulary now so that your<br/>
ready by age 16.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-==--=-=-<br/>
<br/>
*Have* you been saying those things?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible to study for a few months prior and<br/>
learn what is needed to pass?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you think all schooled kids have a clue when they start community <br/>
college?<br/>
<br/>
To *pass*, you should be learning that stuff IN the class you&#39;re <br/>
taking, NOT before you start.<br/>
<br/>
You mean to get IN? Sure---There are books and classes and computer <br/>
programs on how to study for thte SAT and all sorts of other <br/>
standardized tests.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I never have pushed that college is the end all be all<br/>
of life, our children both know that there are tons of options to<br/>
choose from, we just want them happy.  I suppose deep down there is a<br/>
little fear that in four years from now he&#39;ll say, &quot;Thanks for nothing<br/>
Mom.  You put my education on my shoulders and told me that I didn&#39;t<br/>
have to write, read, do math and now I want to go to college and this<br/>
stuff is too hard to learn.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
So you&#39;re thinking that, if you say these things, it&#39;ll be HIS fault if <br/>
he doesn&#39;t follow through? At least *you* could say, &quot;I told you so!&quot; <br/>
???<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 The fear is having my children blame me<br/>
if they ever do want to go to college and for some reason, they are<br/>
disappointed in me as their mother for not properly preparing them.<br/>
KWIM?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe some of you who have overcome that can give me some words of<br/>
wisdom.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well, I didn&#39;t have to overcome that. My father always told me I could <br/>
do/be whatever I wanted to. He encouraged me to try new things. He <br/>
exposed me to as much of the world as he was capable of. He modelled an <br/>
interested and interesting life full of strange things and sometimes <br/>
even stranger people!<br/>
<br/>
So, with my own boys, I figured I&#39;d so the same. Childhood is NOT a <br/>
dress rehearsal: what he does now WILL effect his future---but not in <br/>
the way you and he think it will. The the idea that learning is good <br/>
and available and valuable and that is it what humans DO is more <br/>
important than the facts and figures you&#39;d be taught in school. That we <br/>
are *always* learning and can stop and change and try something new, <br/>
that learning is fun and exciting and inspirational, that learning <br/>
doesn&#39;t LOOK like school subjects---these are what he should be <br/>
learning now---he&#39;ll GET the math and grammar and geography through <br/>
LIVING a rich, full life.<br/>
<br/>

Thanks<br/>

<br/>
Schools THRIVE on &quot;just in case&quot;. That&#39;s not unschooling. In <br/>
unschooling, we KNOW that we will lear what we need to learn when we <br/>
need to learn it. It&#39;s HOW humans learn.<br/>
