<div id="ygrps-yiv-1577407212">My name is Stacey. i&#39;m a homeschool parent of a 7,5 and 1 year old. i <br/>
have always been fascinated by unschooling, but have been met with much <br/>
resistance everytime i try to ask a question.  maybe since this is <br/>
a &#39;basic&#39; group, i may get more of an answer;)<br/>
<br/>
my question is this: let the kids do what they want (i come from a <br/>
radical unschooling group) and follow their own interests. which is <br/>
good, in a way. but what happens if you have a child that goes through <br/>
high school, and never really &#39;got interested&#39; in..what state he/she <br/>
lives in?  or never had any desire to study grammar..do math past a <br/>
basic, elementary level?  i know there are different learning <br/>
experences too, i&#39;m not saying these aren&#39;t the most important, but to <br/>
simply allow kids to just &#39;do what they want&#39;...shouldn&#39;t these things <br/>
be important too?  <br/>
i&#39;m on the boat, let them guide their education..within a certain frame <br/>
to ensure they do get their grammar/math in their too. i don&#39;t know. if <br/>
i could just get this questions answered, i would really appreciate <br/>
it.  <br/>

something sounds as though it could happen doesn&#39;t mean it can happen.<br/>
<br/>
The problem with hypotheticals is that they remove the why behind the  <br/>
event and leave only the what.<br/>
<br/>
*Why* would a child be uninterested in what state they live in? How  <br/>
could that happen? How could it be that the state the child lives in  <br/>
never come up in conversation, and the child never send a letter  <br/>
anywhere, never be asked where they live ...?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; or never had any desire to study grammar<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Does someone need to study grammar to know grammar?<br/>
<br/>
The foundation of unschooling is that we learn how the world words  <br/>
without someone telling us. We see stuff, we come up with theories on  <br/>
how it works, we test the theories, we revise the theories. It&#39;s how  <br/>
we&#39;re hardwired to learn.<br/>
<br/>
School interferes with that natural process.<br/>
<br/>
Think about the difference between how your kids learned to speak  <br/>
English and how kids &quot;learn&quot; Spanish in a class room. Which works  <br/>
naturally without us even realizing it? Which works, well, hardly at  <br/>
all. The only word I remember from Spanish class that I don&#39;t hear in  <br/>
real life is &quot;la escritorio&quot;. (I think it&#39;s one of those weird  <br/>
masculine words that gets a feminine article which is why I remember.  <br/>
But, then again, I could be totally wrong!)<br/>
<br/>
I guarantee that your kids know grammar. They aren&#39;t saying &quot;Ball me  <br/>
give red&quot; are they?<br/>
<br/>
School puts some formal language onto it. They can learn the formal  <br/>
language *way* faster the more real life grammar they absorb and use.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; do math past a<br/>
&gt; basic, elementary level?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If they don&#39;t need it for their interests, do they need it?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a serious question!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s *so* hard to see real math in life because schools have made us  <br/>
think math is the formal &quot;grammar&quot; that they shove down people&#39;s  <br/>
throats. *Real* math is learning how numbers work. Once a child  <br/>
grasps how numbers work -- how numbers can be manipulate to give the  <br/>
information you want to get from them -- then they can grasp the  <br/>
formal notation of addition, multiplication, percentages *much* easier.<br/>
<br/>
They can&#39;t avoid manipulating numbers. Numbers are as much a part of  <br/>
life as words are. Mathematical notation just helps people write it  <br/>
down.<br/>

because schools separate it from real life!)<br/>
<br/>
Did you worry that they didn&#39;t sit down and study English as  <br/>
toddlers? Did you worry that they wouldn&#39;t learn English because life  <br/>
isn&#39;t full of spelling lists naturally encountered? Why didn&#39;t you  <br/>
worry? Is learning English different than learning other things? Why  <br/>
do you believe so? What&#39;s given you that idea?<br/>

use nouns/verbs/adjectives on a daily basis.  they use fragmented <br/>
sentences...there&#39;s a huge line of them, waiting for them on the <br/>
SAT/ACT when they graduate.  but do they &#39;know&#39; them? if asked, they <br/>
would have no idea what i was talking about. they use them, but don&#39;t <br/>
know them.  <br/>
i guess that is where we misunderstood one another.  <br/>
thanks for the site, though, and i will look at it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I just had a giggle here :) thanks! In my school experience, 5th grade was<br/>
the time for *study South Dakota* -- ah the torture!!!!!   Fast forward more<br/>
than 25 years and guess what?? In 5th grade, they never told me that 1/2 our<br/>
state was a prehistoric ocean -- me and my kids discovered that together!<br/>
They never told me our State Bird was brought here by Chinese railroad<br/>
workers and is in no way indigenous to this continent -- you guessed it, me<br/>
and the kids figgered it out!! I could go on and on and on.... There are<br/>
amazing authors and poets and artists from our state that were never, ever<br/>
mentioned in my *school* experience that I have joyfully discovered in my<br/>
Life, with my children by my side or at least in close proximity (I may not<br/>
always talk to *them* directly, the most of our discoveries are together)<br/>
We&#39;ve talked about state and local governments because we talk about things<br/>
that are important to us (and we frequented the same park as the campaign<br/>
rallies did & had a Congressman who was a less than stellar representation<br/>
of the people of SD, etc). Now we live in a whole new state and it&#39;s SO<br/>
exciting for us all to discover new topography, geography, animals, plants,<br/>
people, weather, politics, policies, attitudes.... how could we not want to<br/>
know about this amazing place we live?!?!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a firm believer in &quot;If you are interested, by default you become<br/>
INTERESTING&quot;<br/>
I&#39;m interested in tide pools (and can&#39;t remember a *single* thing I learned<br/>
in my force-fed marine life units from my South Dakota science classes!!) My<br/>
excitement is contagious :) Even if Hayden doesn&#39;t come over immediately,<br/>
because he&#39;s found something else interesting to him, the joy of my own<br/>
discovery has made everyone&#39;s day lovelier &lt;3 I want to be a part of what<br/>
interests him, what brings him joy, what gives him that same rush of<br/>
passion... So I am sure to, at the least, support what he does, and at most,<br/>
be a part of it myself.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; or never had any desire to study grammar..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Did you know that Schoolhouse Rock is about Grammar? Honestly, as a kid, I<br/>
didn&#39;t know I was supposed to learn something ;) I thought it was just<br/>
catchy songs I liked to sing to myself and sometimes they came in handy on a<br/>
test!  I&#39;ve never put on our DVD *in order to* do anything except enjoy a<br/>
rare Happy Memory from my childhood Saturday mornings. Out of my love of<br/>
these diddies came a really easy way to explain how to play &quot;Mad Libs&quot; (and<br/>
besides, the Lolly, Lolly, Lolly song is like fresh fruit preserves on the<br/>
dry toast of explaining adverbs).<br/>
It helps to remember that adverbs existed long before someone began calling<br/>
them &quot;adverbs&quot; and putting them on their own branch of a sentence diagram<br/>
tree. They did the same thing and followed the same kind of rules without<br/>
having to have the special title given to them :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; do math past a basic, elementary level?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How? The same as the above adverb example, the same is true with numbers and<br/>
their manipulation. Before someone came up with the clever word &quot;addition&quot;<br/>
folks had been &quot;putting things together&quot; for centuries. Things added up and<br/>
subtracted down without &quot;school approved&quot; vocabulary.<br/>
That said, exposure to Life -- income discussions, bills being paid,<br/>
discussions about budgeting, shopping, figuring tax and discounts (not to<br/>
mention rounds and rounds of Monopoly Jr and the like)... all happen *with*<br/>
my kid(s), not separate from them, I just can&#39;t fathom how anyone could<br/>
*miss* this kind of information...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; shouldn&#39;t these things<br/>
&gt; be important too?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They&#39;re *very* important!! To have fluency in your native language is<br/>
important -- it comes from using it! To have fluency in how to manipulate<br/>
numbers (money, peas, gas mileage, WoW finances ::bg::) -- comes from using<br/>
them!!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; i&#39;m on the boat, let them guide their education..within a certain frame<br/>

It&#39;s kind of a &quot;you&#39;re either pregnant or you&#39;re not&quot; kind of proposition<br/>
for me, there&#39;s no &quot;kinda pregnant&quot; just like there&#39;s no &quot;kinda trust&quot; with<br/>
unschooling.<br/>

I say this from real life experience. You have NO idea if your kids will<br/>
even want to go that route, nor whether they&#39;ll survive long enough to tread<br/>
those waters. One could start a business at age 8 and be independently<br/>
wealthy by 12!! The bottom line is No One Knows.<br/>
<br/>
I have *NO* regrets about my DD dying without knowing how to write a<br/>

One of my favorite quotes (oy! I&#39;ve got too many!!) &quot;If you&#39;ve got one foot<br/>

College worries are not worth missing out on your Right Here, Right Now, I<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, I didn&#39;t misunderstand at all. I&#39;m saying &quot;Yes, it does.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What you&#39;re asking about is the formal language. The names for the  <br/>
parts of speech.<br/>
<br/>
When a child has been using English for 16 years it takes 5 minutes  <br/>
to get across the concepts of nouns, verbs and so on when they *want*  <br/>
to take the SAT. It will be information acquired for a purpose that&#39;s  <br/>
important to them.<br/>
<br/>
If you start teaching early before they have the ability to  <br/>
intellectually grasp the abstract concepts, it takes years because 1)  <br/>
they don&#39;t care and 2) they care even less because someone&#39;s making  <br/>
them listen to information about something they have no interest in  <br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
But before 16, as part of their rich unschooling lives, you should  <br/>
have stumbled across Mad Libs and had fun times with them.<br/>
<br/>
So reread what I wrote with that in mind.<br/>
<br/>
When they were 2 and said &quot;Mama, up,&quot; did you worry that they weren&#39;t  <br/>
speaking in full sentences? Why? Why didn&#39;t you project that behavior  <br/>
onto their future 16 yo selves? Why did you think that just by living  <br/>
life that their sentences would flesh out and become more complex if  <br/>
someone didn&#39;t make them? Why would they ever use a dozen words if 2  <br/>
got the meaning across? Because you&#39;d seen it happen?<br/>
<br/>
Why do you worry that their right now selves are who they will be in  <br/>
10+ years unless you make them be something different than what they  <br/>
are? Why do you think they&#39;re incapable of learning about the world?  <br/>
Because you only know institutionalized kids? You only know kids  <br/>
who&#39;ve had information they don&#39;t care about crammed into them for  <br/>
years and years?<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve seen kids absorb what state they live in, learn what a noun is  <br/>
in order to play MadLibs, figure out percentages and charts and  <br/>
graphs and memorize complex 3D maps and strategize ways past an  <br/>
obstacle in order to play video games (by using math that&#39;s much more  <br/>
complex and real that is taught in school). *Your* part is to give  <br/>
them rich lives so they aren&#39;t locked away from a world where they  <br/>
would naturally pick up what state they live in! And pick up that  <br/>
Shakespeare existed. But don&#39;t focus on where you want them to go  <br/>
(Shakespeare). Focus on what&#39;s fun for them and the world will be in  <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
Can unschooled kids sit down and ace the SAT on the first try? It  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be reasonable to expect them to. But they&#39;ve absorbed the  <br/>
foundation of knowledge they need by *using* what kids in school have  <br/>
only been cramming into their heads with memorization. They lack the  <br/>
formal language to manipulate it but understanding is the truly  <br/>
profound part of knowledge. The formal language can be learned easily.<br/>
<br/>
What unschooled kids learn is how to learn. They learn how *they*  <br/>
learn. They don&#39;t absorb the idea as schooled kids do that they must  <br/>
be taught by an expert with a textbook and homework.<br/>
<br/>
They can also learn that a lot of colleges are moving away from SATs  <br/>
(and even more by the time your kids are ready for college) and  <br/>
deliberately choose a school that doesn&#39;t use them. They can take  <br/>
college classes in high school *for fun* at community colleges. They  <br/>
can work and volunteer and apprentice in the fields that interest  <br/>
them. They can actually be *doing* what they plan to get paid for  <br/>
before they go to college (or get a job). That looks *way* better to  <br/>
colleges than some kid who&#39;s been trained to fill in the right dot on  <br/>
a piece of paper. Colleges like older students (and don&#39;t require  <br/>
SATs from them!) who have been out in life doing what they want to  <br/>
do, exploring. The colleges know they&#39;re already capable of doing the  <br/>
work that they&#39;ll learn in college. They&#39;ll know that they&#39;re  <br/>
enthusiastic about the major because they&#39;ve already been involved in  <br/>
it. As opposed to high school kids who&#39;ve been kept locked away from  <br/>
the world for 12+ years memorizing at textbooks and jumping through  <br/>
hoops they&#39;re told to jump through so they can jump through more  <br/>
hoops to do what maybe might interest them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; also, another question came to mind.  how do unschooled kids get  <br/>
&gt; into college?  if they have no transcripts..i mean, they weren&#39;t  <br/>
&gt; taking any classes..were they?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As Kelly asked recently, why would you want your kids to look like  <br/>
every other applicant to college? If they&#39;ve been living interesting  <br/>
lives exploring the subject they plan to pursue in college, why would  <br/>
you want their application to look like they&#39;d spent their years  <br/>
sitting in classrooms with textbooks?<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve so bought into the educational system that we believe that it&#39;s  <br/>
the ultimate achievement in learning. Baloney. It&#39;s just all that  <br/>
colleges have to work with. They have 1000s of applications that all  <br/>
look *exactly* the same. They have all these applicants who&#39;ve been  <br/>
jumping through hoops for 12 years being told they need for more  <br/>
years of hoops in order to achieve the American Dream. Colleges know  <br/>
that the majority of those kids are clueless about life. But that&#39;s  <br/>
all they get.<br/>
<br/>
Except for the older applicants who&#39;ve been out in life doing what  <br/>
they want to learn more about. Except for the unschooled kids who  <br/>
were out living life and exploring what interests them. Harvard  <br/>
*likes* unschooled kids :-) They stand out from the 1600 SATs and  <br/>
Aced AP classes. They&#39;ve been out doing. They, more than schooled  <br/>
kids, are applying to Harvard because they want what they&#39;ll learn at  <br/>
Harvard, not because they want a piece of paper that says Harvard on it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1774318338">~~..there&#39;s a huge line of them, waiting for them on the<br/>
SAT/ACT when they graduate. but do they &#39;know&#39; them?~~<br/>
<br/>
The SAT/ACT may never be their reality. You&#39;re borrowing trouble from<br/>
a future that may never happen. If they have some reason or need for<br/>
that, you can study for the SAT/ACT exams a few months and be ready<br/>
(or even less time)!<br/>
Most people that learned this stuff in school can&#39;t remember a bit of<br/>
it. If we need the info. we find it out WHEN and IF we need it. Only<br/>
if something is important to the learner will it be truly learned.<br/>
<br/>
So if you think they need to learn it, just because of some potential<br/>
in the future for needing it, that&#39;s not a good reason in my book. If<br/>
they&#39;re interested in understanding it at some point, THEN you can<br/>
help them find the information.<br/>

Hypotheticals are not good for discussion because just because<br/>
something sounds as though it could happen doesn&#39;t mean it can happen.<br/>
<br/>
The problem with hypotheticals is that they remove the why behind the<br/>
event and leave only the what.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Right. Do you KNOW of a child who is mid-teens who doesn&#39;t know where <br/>
he lives? Tell us about him.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
*Why* would a child be uninterested in what state they live in? How<br/>
could that happen? How could it be that the state the child lives in<br/>
never come up in conversation, and the child never send a letter<br/>
anywhere, never be asked where they live ...?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
The only reason I could think of is that the parents were not <br/>
interested and chose to keep all state info top secret! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The boys and I spend lots of time traveling our state just looking <br/>
something else to discover. South Carolina has a RICH history! We like <br/>
to look at/for it!<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; or never had any desire to study grammar&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>School puts some formal language onto it. They can learn the formal<br/>
language *way* faster the more real life grammar they absorb and use.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
The BEST way to help your children grasp grammar is to USE proper <br/>
grammar!!!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a grammar nazi---it&#39;s important to me that my boys don&#39;t <br/>
sound...um....South Carolinian (to get back to the state reference <br/>
&lt;g&gt;). I want them to understand how to use adverbs and when to use the <br/>
objective case. I HATE to hear the &quot;to him and I&quot; that&#39;s sooo common in <br/>
vernacular. It just sends me reeling!<br/>
<br/>
So I do my little freak-out when a news anchor says something so <br/>
blatantly wrong. Worse is when I find it PUBLISHED somewhere---I just <br/>
want to scream, &quot;Where was the editor???&quot; I&#39;m not shy in pointing out a <br/>
better way to say something. I&#39;m happy to edit their <br/>
letters/notes/articles/etc.---IF they ask. If they ask &quot;why&quot; <br/>
such-and-such is wrong, I can tell them: you use that &quot;&#39;s&quot; because <br/>
English uses a &quot;possessive before the gerund.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If it is important to YOU that your children learn grammar, then YOU <br/>
learn grammar and be able to answer their questions about language <br/>
usage. Don&#39;t use bad grammar in front of them. Make every effort to <br/>
understand how language works and share what you know.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s NO different than any other thing. If it were important to me that <br/>
my boys understand about car engines, I would need to either KNOW about <br/>
car engines or find someone who does. Car engines and their care would <br/>
be high on my list of things that we&#39;d talk about. (They&#39;re NOT, in my <br/>
family---we have a good mechanic, so I doubt my sons will ever be <br/>
immersed in that particular world. And that&#39;s fine---but *some* people <br/>
would think I&#39;m doing my boys a huge disservice to not expose them to <br/>
auto care and maintenance. A lot more people feel the same way about <br/>
grammar. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend whose mother never allowed her in the kitchen---no <br/>
joke. Not even for a glass of water. We had to ask *her*, and she would <br/>
bring it to us. Her mother wonders now why Caroline doesn&#39;t cook. <br/>
Luckily she married a man who adores being in the kitchen. Exposure, <br/>
exposure, exposure!<br/>
<br/>
My point &lt;g&gt; is that if our children are surrounded by things, they <br/>
will learn them---naturally and (relatively) painlessly. &lt;g&gt; If you <br/>
choose to use good grammar, the example you&#39;re setting is that grammar <br/>
is important. Plus---what we *hear* becomes natural to our ears.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t need to diagram a sentence to understand grammar. (I have <br/>
never diagramed a sentence; that became popular, I guess, just after my <br/>
school days. My brother had to though.)<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of good books on understanding grammar so that *YOU* <br/>
can become more familiar with how and why. _Eats, Shoots and Leaves_ is <br/>
very popular. _A Grammar Book for You and I (Oops ME!): All the Grammar <br/>
You Need to Know to Succeed in Life_. _The Elements of Style_ is good, <br/>
but dry. I&#39;m interested in getting _Grammar Snobs are Great BIG <br/>
Meanies_. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
By imposing it as a separate thing---like a school subject---you&#39;re <br/>
making it almost inaccessible.. Better to make it a part of everyday <br/>
conversation (so to speak &lt;g&gt;) They learn it because they USE it. And <br/>
they learn it better if it&#39;s modeled better *for* them.<br/>

my question is this: let the kids do what they want (i come from a<br/>
radical unschooling group) and follow their own interests. which is<br/>
good, in a way. but what happens if you have a child that goes through<br/>
high school, and never really &#39;got interested&#39; in..what state he/she<br/>
lives in?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Do you know a child like this?<br/>
<br/>
-==-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
 or never had any desire to study grammar..do math past a<br/>
basic, elementary level?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Why would someone choose to study grammar? Because she wants to? that&#39;s <br/>
a REALLY good reason.<br/>
<br/>
Why would somebody choose to study math past a basic elementary level? <br/>
Because she wants to? That&#39;s a really good reason.<br/>
<br/>
Why would somebody choose NOT to study grammar or math? Because there <br/>
are sooo many other really interesting things to *study*.<br/>
<br/>
Can someone grow up in a grammar-rich and math-rich world and not come <br/>
away with a good foundation in grammar and math?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 i know there are different learning<br/>
experences too, i&#39;m not saying these aren&#39;t the most important, but to<br/>
simply allow kids to just &#39;do what they want&#39;...shouldn&#39;t these things<br/>
be important too?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
What is important to the learner WILL be important to the learner---and <br/>
will be learned.<br/>
<br/>
Who gets to decide what&#39;s important and what&#39;s not? William Bennett? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-===-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;m on the boat, let them guide their education..within a certain frame<br/>
to ensure they do get their grammar/math in their too. i don&#39;t know. if<br/>
i could just get this questions answered, i would really appreciate<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>

I don&#39;t know that you&#39;re &quot;on the boat.&quot; I think you may have the cruise <br/>

i guess what i was trying to say on grammar is &#39;just speaking&#39;,<br/>
doesn&#39;t necessarily mean your child &#39;understands&#39; grammar.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=--=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Humans acquire language by listening to other humans speak. They learn <br/>
about sentence structure from hearing it and reading it. That IS how we <br/>
show understanding of a language. You can tell a foreign speaker often <br/>
by how he constructs sentences. Yoda is a German. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
my kids use nouns/verbs/adjectives on a daily basis.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=--=<br/>
<br/>
Good.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
they use fragmented sentences...<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Do they use capital letters and proper punctuation?<br/>
<br/>
If you write notes to them (when they&#39;re old enough to read), it would <br/>
help them to see proper grammar and punctuation. It would help, when <br/>
you speak to them, to use proper grammar and not fragmented sentences.<br/>
<br/>
What are you doing to develop these skills yourself?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
there&#39;s a huge line of them, waiting for them on the<br/>
SAT/ACT when they graduate.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Huh?<br/>
<br/>
1) The truly educated never graduate.<br/>
2) SATs and ACTs may very well be a thing of the past by the time your <br/>
*tiny* children become old enough to even take them. Let&#39;s not worry <br/>
about things so insignificant.<br/>
3) If the SAT *becomes* a reality for them---AND they want to take it, <br/>
they can pick up a study guide called _How to Study for the SAT_ and <br/>
even take online practice tests.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
but do they &#39;know&#39; them? if asked, they<br/>
would have no idea what i was talking about. they use them, but don&#39;t<br/>
know them.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Does a seven year old NEED to know grammar rules? It certainly helps if <br/>
he *hears* the English language spoken well. As he gets older, it will <br/>
help if he reads well-written books so that he can *see* sentence <br/>
structure. But I can think of NO reason a seven year old should study <br/>
grammar (unless he likes it!).<br/>
<br/>
He will gather that info as he grows and learns. He will make <br/>
connections with each person he hears speak and each <br/>
book/article/website he reads. Eventually he&#39;ll make connections. If he <br/>
ever needs to actually learn more about grammar, he will look into it.<br/>

Yeah?<br/>
<br/>
Next time I see you, I&#39;ll translate some German literally---word by <br/>
word. Let&#39;s see if that works! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

playing madlibs, and maybe from watching schoolhouse rock.Randy and I <br/>
got schoolhouse rock for ourselves,but the kids like it too!<br/>
BTW, when I was in school, I was always in the gifted and talented <br/>
classes for LA,because I could read well, write stories and poetry,<br/>
but I could never make outlines properly, and it wasn&#39;t until I was <br/>
about 30 that I understood what a predicate was. The more they read and <br/>
see proper sentences the better they will understand sentence structure <br/>
and spelling.Instead of spelling lessons, how about finding lots of <br/>
books on subjects they really like? We go to the library a lot! <br/>
  Knowing the words for what the parts of the sentences are called is <br/>
like knowing what addends, subtrahends,minuends, multipliers and <br/>
multiplicands all are. I can do subtraction without ever knowing which <br/>
number is the subtrahend and which is the minuend.<br/>
  Do you know that your child will definitely be taking the SAT? What <br/>
if they do the CLEP instead? What if they go to art school and need a <br/>
portfolio instead? Do you have to prepare now for the SAT later? <br/>
Who knows what they might pick up between now and then?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-647867150">I&#39;ve got an 8yo just about to come out of school for an &#39;unschooling trial&#39;.<br/>
She loves her two little brothers (2 and 4), but gets sick of them,<br/>
especially the 4 year old who is autistic and who tends to yell a lot and<br/>
talk about Thomas the Tank Engine ad infinitum.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a bit concerned that our unschooling adventure could get derailed<br/>
because she just won&#39;t be able to spend that much time with her brother<br/>
happily and would prefer to be out of the house with friends who are more<br/>
like herself.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Any tips for how to keep them living happily together, while giving each one<br/>
what they need and want?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks, cecily<br/>

<br/>
An easy way to do that is to arrange several regular ((every week)  <br/>
park get-togethers (or an indoor space if you can&#39;t do outdoors all  <br/>
year).<br/>
<br/>
Also, invite her friends over a lot to play with her while you occupy  <br/>
her brothers.<br/>
