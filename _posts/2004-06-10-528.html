<div id="ygrps-yiv-385448895">We&#39;ve started letting go of our control issues and I know it&#39;s going <br/>
to take time for everyone to adjust... but this is ridiculous!<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday our 5yo tried to make his room into a swimming pool by <br/>
spraying the hose into his open window. As my husband and I sat on <br/>
the couch and the STINK of the soaked carpet began to waft through <br/>
the house, my husband expressed that he is finding it very difficult <br/>
not to go back to yelling and spanking, he feels this new parenting <br/>
method is not working - and it&#39;s all my fault...heated discussion <br/>
ensued...Tonight when he gets home we have to rip up the carpet <br/>
before the floor starts to rot, so he&#39;s already going to be in a bad <br/>
mood. <br/>
<br/>
And now for the BEST part - this morning I was in the kitchen <br/>
washing dishes, kids happily playing in the living room, I go in to <br/>
check on them and 5yo has completely ripped the screen door (the <br/>
very same screen door that my husband just fixed about a month ago). <br/>
Why did he rip the screen door? Because he wanted the water to come <br/>
in (it&#39;s raining here today). Daddy is probably going to be very mad <br/>
about this, what are we going to do? Daddy can&#39;t find me if I hide <br/>
under my bed. You can&#39;t hide under your bed forever.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve already told 5yo that I expect him to tell Daddy he is sorry <br/>
for ripping the screen and I expect him to help fix it. But I am <br/>
seriously worried about how my husband is going to react to this. <br/>
What am I going to do?<br/>

    My husband is the same way sometimes.  It;s hard for him to let go of<br/>
the &quot;the way I grew up&quot; way of thinking.  I can tell you with 100% certainty<br/>
that with your type of child spanking will not work long term,(and I know<br/>
you already know this).  What&#39;s done is done all the yelling and spanking<br/>
won&#39;t help anything.  My advice:  Put the hose away if you can&#39;t give him<br/>
something to fill or spray the hose with, leave his floor wood for awhile he<br/>
doesn&#39;t really need carpet anyway, and the screen door I saw this cool<br/>
inexpensive screen that splits in the middle when you walk through it.  No<br/>
need to rip it off it&#39;s already open.  If your intention was to keep him in<br/>
then shut the door.<br/>
     Just curious, but what&#39;s his fascination with water?  Is this something<br/>
you could build on.  Build dams, channel water, visit streams etc.. There is<br/>
so much fun involved in water I can understand his fascination of it.<br/>
   I know it&#39;s tough, but try to hang in there.<br/>

Thanks for your advice... my husband and I know that yelling and <br/>
spanking does nothing to solve this problem (or any problem for that <br/>
matter) but in his eyes, neither the permissive style nor the <br/>
controlling style is having any effect, so since he grew up with the <br/>
controlling style that&#39;s what he&#39;s going to go with.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Kenyon is fascinated with water, and I do try to give him time <br/>
to play and experiment with water as much as possible, but if he&#39;s <br/>
not being supervised it gets out of control-as was the case with him <br/>
drenching his bedroom floor-he was outside playing with the hose, I <br/>
had to go tend to the baby, he saw the open window, the floor was <br/>
soaked before I even knew what happened. Same thing with the screen <br/>
door, the front door was open to let in the fresh, cool air that <br/>
came with the rainstorm (our house has been stifling hot for 3 days <br/>
now). The screen door was latched to keep my toddler daughter and <br/>
infant nephew safe. Kenyon couldn&#39;t reach the latch to open the <br/>
door, so he tore the screen to get out to the rain. <br/>
<br/>
This is driving me NUTS! I just have to keep looking at it as <br/>
learning opportunity (for my husband and me) I guess. Hopefully my <br/>
husband will be able to see it as a learning opportunity...<br/>

    Your son sounds so much like mine, really.  The stories I could tell.<br/>
The things he has destroyed.  I know you may not believe it now, but it will<br/>
get better and rather suddenly.  It took much teeth clenching and walking<br/>
away for me to handle it well, but I think it&#39;s starting to pay off.<br/>
<br/>
Again, good luck<br/>
