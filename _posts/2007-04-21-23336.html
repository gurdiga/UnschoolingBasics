<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was thinking more that &quot;hitting is not okay&quot; is a judgement in and <br/>
of itself, and one that is really terribly complex. Its a rules-vs-<br/>
principles thing. Hitting *is* okay in certain situations, so saying <br/>
its not sets up the whole rules dynamic. <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>take the toy. <br/>
<br/>
This tells me the child *has* heard plenty of &quot;no hitting&quot; type <br/>
statements. No-one is helping him understand *why* its not (always) <br/>
okay to hit, or helping him get what he wants in other ways, though, <br/>
so he keeps doing it bc it works. That&#39;s what happens with rules. If <br/>
they are inconvenient, people find ways around them. This guy knows <br/>
the rule and is learning to subvert it.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>problems, how helpful is <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; it to tell this boy that hitting hurts?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re assuming he&#39;s comfortable hurting people. I&#39;m assuming he&#39;s <br/>
found an effective way to get what he wants and isn&#39;t thinking about <br/>
the other people at all. That may sound strange, but young children <br/>
really don&#39;t make the same kinds of connections that adults do. He <br/>
*needs* to hear that hitting hurts *and* people don&#39;t necessarily <br/>
like to be hit/hurt. It&#39;s not intuitively obvious to him. His mom <br/>
may not realize that either. He may also need to hear just <br/>
plain &quot;Stop!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What he *really* needs is someone being more proactive in helping <br/>
him get his needs met so he isn&#39;t put in the position of using a <br/>
default strategy like hitting.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think we do need to talk, you&#39;re right. I don&#39;t see how he could <br/>
 </span></blockquote>have felt &#39;forced&#39; to share <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; when the toys belonged to the museum and someone else had them <br/>
 </span></blockquote>first. He doesn&#39;t have <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; first claim on every single toy, which seemed to be his <br/>
 </span></blockquote>perspective. <br/>
<br/>
Of course its his perspective. Why shouldn&#39;t it be? Doesn&#39;t the sun <br/>
rise and set around little children? He needs help seeing *another* <br/>
perspective. That&#39;s perfectly normal for a young child. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m seeing you falling into the trap of thinking he&#39;s a &quot;bad kid&quot; <br/>
for not having very much empathy right now. Several of your <br/>
statements about him seem to imply that. He needs more support and <br/>
facilitation than other children, maybe. I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s your <br/>
job! but I&#39;m disturbed by the implications of statements like: &quot;For <br/>
this particular child, from playdate to playdate, that seems to be <br/>
the goal, to hurt a baby.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s not a monster. He&#39;s a little kid who&#39;s struggling to understand <br/>
social situations and using the only tool he has.<br/>

<br/>
So true.<br/>
It&#39;s not as useful when trying to resolve day-to-day issues with<br/>
people, but it can be a great way to escape harm.:)<br/>
<br/>
With Jalen, it was a lot more useful to say something simple like &quot;use<br/>
words&quot; or &quot;WAIT, I&#39;ll help you!&quot; (as I&#39;m intervening) rather than<br/>
&quot;don&#39;t hit&quot;.  When we repeatedly model how to get what you want with<br/>
positive and healthy methods, our children eventually learn that. <br/>

write angry words with red crayon on a piece of paper. But having a child with significant <br/>

I know that someone has said that saying &#39;using words&#39; is not always appropriate, so what <br/>

   <br/>
  Well Ive strayed a bit away from use words with my younger 2 because my 5 yr old is nonverbal and my 4 year old ....well to be honest *I* have a lot of trouble understanding what she is saying and she gets very frustrated when I tell her to slow down or please look at me and speak louder so...........<br/>
   <br/>
  can you show me? and &quot;help me understand&quot;  has been very useful around here. Often the 4 year old simply slows her self down and it solves the problem ..........but shell also get creative and drag me to it, draw a picture, use brothers PECS, etc. The 5 year old autistic one well............he usualy just throws himself on the floor and screams .<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I sometimes us it the same way with Mo (or just &quot;words!&quot;), and <br/>
sometimes that&#39;s all she needs. I wouldn&#39;t use the expression with <br/>
someone else&#39;s kid unless I&#39;d seen his/her mom use it successfully. <br/>
I&#39;m more likely to offer help in either case.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to look for the specific thread on this topic - it may be <br/>
over at AU, now that I think about it. I&#39;ll see what I can dig up.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; so what <br/>
&gt; specifically  would *you* say or do in this exact situation?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In the specific museum instance I&#39;d have called the kid&#39;s mom - hey <br/>
someone needs help, here!<br/>
<br/>
At this point, I&#39;d talk with the other mom *before* the issue can <br/>
come up again. Once a child has reached the hitting point, there <br/>
aren&#39;t a lot of good in-the-moment options to begin with, and with <br/>
tempers high, its hard to be creative. So having options laid out <br/>
before hand is really important. How does mom prefer these sorts of <br/>
situations to be handled? How can you make it easier for her to help <br/>
her kid get his needs met without stomping all over others? Maybe <br/>
something like:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Kid didn&#39;t seem to have a very good time at the museum - he seemed <br/>
to be getting really frustrated. Is there something we/I can do <br/>
differently to help him out, next time?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
and listen to what mom has to say. She may need some help, but not <br/>
know how to ask - or if its okay to ask. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d also really want to talk with the other moms in the group - <br/>
didn&#39;t you say this is an ongoing issue? What&#39;s their perspective? <br/>
Is everyone equally baffled or is there some information or history <br/>
that you aren&#39;t aware of? Do you just have different expectations <br/>
than the rest of the group as to what happens when groups of <br/>
children play together?<br/>

<br/>
I really like the way you&#39;ve cast this, Laureen. I think you&#39;ve <br/>
really<br/>
gotten to the core of the issue when you point to the need to control<br/>
the situation over the emotional well-being.<br/>
<br/>
I do say &quot;words please&quot; or &quot;I can&#39;t help you if I don&#39;t know what you<br/>
need&quot;--depending upon how many words *from me* I think the child can<br/>
process. In part, it is about me wanting to control the situation--<br/>
i.e.<br/>
help fix what ever&#39;s wrong. But, also, I think it probably ties into<br/>
that emotional need for myself to be able to make things right. Not<br/>
always the purest motivation, as we&#39;ve talked about before here at <br/>
AU.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing I&#39;ll do is remind them to breathe--another good <br/>
strategy<br/>
for calming and regaining access to language.<br/>
<br/>
This conversation has me reconsidering whether calming and fixing are<br/>
really the best reactions on my part, wondering whether empathy first<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be a better approach. Lots of food for thought and a great<br/>
reminder to be more mindful of my own reactions in these situations.<br/>
<br/>
In theory, I agree empathy first is a great approach, but practically<br/>
I&#39;m not so sure it&#39;s that easy.<br/>
<br/>
First, it&#39;s kinda hard to empathize without understanding. Of course,<br/>
there can be pure love without understanding, but often when a child <br/>
is<br/>
wanting empathy, what they&#39;re needing is precisely that<br/>
understanding--another human being who can say, I understand, I get <br/>
it,<br/>
which validates the emotions and needs.<br/>
<br/>
Second, not all kids in all situations are going to want empathy <br/>
first.<br/>
Sometimes fixing it really is what they want--and NOW! I have totally<br/>
been on the receiving end of a<br/>
&quot;make-it-better-now-or-you&#39;re-completely-useless-to-me!&quot; attitude <br/>
that&#39;s<br/>
born of pure frustration.<br/>
<br/>
And I don&#39;t have kids who want to hit pillows--that&#39;s just never <br/>
been a<br/>
useful strategy for us. *shrug* Even Sam, who can really rage, has <br/>
never<br/>
wanted or accepted redirection for his anger, and we&#39;ve brainstormed <br/>
*a<br/>
lot* and tried lots of different possibilities. He pretty much justs<br/>
wants to discharge in his own way--not hitting a pillow, or a couch, <br/>
or<br/>
a bed, just pure raging. Getting him into his room where he can <br/>
throw,<br/>
hit, bang, whatever, in these moments has been what works best for<br/>
us--Sam can release and move through his intense emotions more <br/>
quickly<br/>
while everyone and everyone&#39;s things stay safe. Of course, I&#39;m not<br/>
telling him to use his words in these situations either. ;)</div>

<br/>
Dylan wasn&#39;t a hitter and we were lucky that most of his friends in those <br/>
days were gentle, pacifist kids too. &lt;g&gt;  One little boy though, was from a <br/>
big family and was knocked around by his older brother.  If he&#39;d had a <br/>
scuffle with his brother before he came to our house he&#39;d be rough with <br/>
Dylan and rough with toys and cats.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t say &quot;use word&quot; because he thought he had used words to solve his <br/>
problem when he first said &quot;give me that or I&#39;ll hit you,&quot; or just &quot;NO!&quot; or <br/>
&quot;MINE.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What I said if he seemed to be getting worked up was a <br/>
specific-to-the-moment, &quot;Don&#39;t hit him!  I&#39;ll help you.&quot;   I tried to keep <br/>
the cats out of his way but if I hadn&#39;t done that I would remind him, &quot;Don&#39;t <br/>
hit the cat,  I&#39;ll move her.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t say &quot;People shouldn&#39;t hit,&quot; because his mom spanked and his <br/>
siblings smacked each other so his experience was that people DO hit. <br/>
Shouldn&#39;t schmoodent.  When you&#39;re five, and have just been whacked in the <br/>
knee with a baseball bat, philosophy means nothing at all.<br/>
