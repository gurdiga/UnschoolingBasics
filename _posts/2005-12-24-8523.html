<div id="ygrps-yiv-1939426044">My goodness why am I doing this at 12.09 on Christmas morning... I just<br/>
realised the time. <br/>
 <br/>
Well anyway, I just wanted to give a quick introduction. <br/>
 <br/>
My name is Stephanie and I have been home educating for the past 3<br/>
years. <br/>
 <br/>
my boys are pre-teens and I have been questioning the whole natural<br/>
learning thing for the high school years and when I got home from work<br/>
tonight and the house was all quiet I decided to have a quick search on<br/>
the web to pursue some strand that I had read in a home ed magazine.<br/>
Well one link led to another and here I am... I stumbled upon this group<br/>
and joined up. <br/>
 <br/>
I am looking forward to chatting about natural learning in the teen<br/>
years as I have mostly seen examples of how well it work in the primary<br/>
school years. But for now I must shoot off and get some sleep.<br/>
 <br/>
Wishing you all a wonderful Christmas<br/>
 <br/>
Kind regards <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-708279967">Hi Stephanie,<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to say &quot;welcome&quot; from a mom of an unschooled 14 yo.   <br/>
I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ve introduced<br/>
myself here -- my name is Chris and I have Zach 14 and Zoe 8.  We&#39;ve  <br/>
been radically unschooling for about 2 years now.  Life is so good!   <br/>
They&#39;re so happy and so are my dh and I!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Merry Everything!<br/>
Chris in IA<br/>

Success<br/>
To laugh often and much; to win the affection of children; to earn  <br/>
the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false  <br/>
friends; to appreciate beauty; to find the best in others; to leave  <br/>
the world a bit better,  whether by a healthy child, a garden patch  <br/>
or a redeemed social condition; to know even one life has breathed  <br/>
easier because you have lived.<br/>
This is to have succeeded.<br/>

<br/>
Do you have any specific questions about those ages or unschooling <br/>
older children?<br/>
I have four children, ages 16 (as of Jan. 1st!), 12, 8 and 4.<br/>
I can say that unschooling works beautifully at all ages, I don&#39;t see <br/>
any need to interfere in their learning just because they get older, <br/>
but maybe that&#39;s not what you&#39;re questioning?<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if there&#39;s anything specific you&#39;re pondering, or just <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1577606948">Hi Ren (and all)<br/>
 <br/>
To be honest I am just scared.... normal parental paranoia ... how will<br/>
they turn out... what will they do when they &quot;grow up&quot; etc. I want them<br/>
to have the option to go to university or not. <br/>
 <br/>
I live in Australia, and there is a huge stigma with not going to<br/>
University. I don&#39;t necessarily agree that uni is an essential step on<br/>
the road to success, I guess I am just facing the demons of my<br/>
upbringing, that quietly whisper that uni would be preferable.  <br/>
 <br/>
I certainly don&#39;t want my boys to not go to Uni just because they don&#39;t<br/>
know their maths or English well enough. But I also don&#39;t want them to<br/>
go just because they &quot;should&quot;. <br/>
 <br/>
I know all the unschooling theory to answer each one of my own issues,<br/>
but that doesn&#39;t quieten the &quot;voices&quot;. <br/>
 <br/>
So I joined this group just to see what others are up to. <br/>
 <br/>
We are very social folks and have a great network of other natural<br/>
learners, here in Adelaide. But my boys do love their computer games and<br/>
so I find I need to limit those to weekends. And to be brutally honest,<br/>
if I don&#39;t prod them along they don&#39;t seem to do much during the day. I<br/>
spend a lot of time &quot;entertaining&#39; them. Playing with them etc, and when<br/>
I have to do my chores they complain.... does that sound familiar to<br/>
anyone else?<br/>
 <br/>
Look forward to your responses<br/>
<br/>

Hi Stephanie!<br/>
 <br/>
I said recently that I am trying something new with my kids.  I am  (not <br/>
perfectly, of course) attempting to do my chores in the morning, being less  <br/>
available for my kids and then have the afternoon to spend with them.  So  far, <br/>
this has worked well.  It took a couple of days of getting used to,  but now it <br/>
is more or less routine.<br/>
 <br/>
I had to do something!  My stuff wasn&#39;t getting done and I was  stressed and <br/>
not a happy mommy.  Now they have a more relaxed mommy that  has her mind on <br/>
them, not on the million things that needed to get done.<br/>
 <br/>
Hope you find something that works for you and your boys!<br/>
 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-419241793">First, I want to let you know that you&#39;re not alone in dealing with <br/>
those darn &quot;voices&quot; Stephanie. Even after years of questioning and <br/>
letting go, I&#39;ll get the strangest responses internally....and I have <br/>
to have these little internal dialogues.<br/>
<br/>
Your kids don&#39;t have to know about it, you can just coach yourself <br/>
through the moment, realize it&#39;s not about University or careers or <br/>
success...it&#39;s just your schooled mind kicking in, breathe deep and <br/>

<br/>
First of all, you&#39;ll get a lot of advice here about not limiting your <br/>
children&#39;s computer games and not prodding anymore. It might be <br/>
backfiring on you.<br/>
Unschooling is built on trust, and we tell our children we don&#39;t trust <br/>
them when we control the activities they love or push them to do <br/>
things they don&#39;t enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
What is it that you fear if you let them play computer games more? <br/>
There&#39;s lots of learning going on in those games. I think it&#39;s <br/>
possible that the way you view their activities has more to do with it <br/>
than anything. That was sure true for myself.<br/>
<br/>
Once you shift your view to seeing everything THEY love as valuable, <br/>
everything that interests them as learning, then things will unfold <br/>
more smoothly.<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there and welcome.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1538564345">Thanks Ren <br/>
 <br/>
It is about trust... letting go of my expectations of them is a hard<br/>
thing.... and dh finds it even harder. LOL, but he is a trusting old<br/>
soul and even thought he doesnt understand this whole unschooling thing,<br/>
he trusts me to find the right path for the boys.... Oh isnt that<br/>
interesting... I just realised one of the flaws in my thinking, having<br/>
written that last sentence... Dh is trusting me, and I am trusting ME...<br/>
rather than us trusting the children..... Mmmm that&#39;s interesting!!! <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for your words about the &quot;voices&quot; -  I was afraid you would think<br/>
I was off with the fairies. <br/>

There&#39;s lots of learning going on in those games. I think it&#39;s <br/>
possible that the way you view their activities has more to do with it <br/>
than anything. That was sure true for myself.<br/>
<br/>
Once you shift your view to seeing everything THEY love as valuable, <br/>
everything that interests them as learning, then things will unfold <br/>
more smoothly.<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there and welcome.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-964146770">&quot; Dh is trusting me, and I am trusting ME...<br/>
rather than us trusting the children..... Mmmm that&#39;s interesting!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hey, that&#39;s not all bad!!! If you can find trust in yourselves again, <br/>
then it will be easier to learn how to trust your children.<br/>
People that doubt themselves all the time, have a harder time learning <br/>
to trust their children.  Not that we don&#39;t doubt ourselves at <br/>
times...I&#39;m just talking generally here.<br/>
<br/>
John Holt said: &quot;Trust Children. Nothing could be more simple, or more <br/>
difficult. Difficult because to trust children we must first learn to <br/>
trust ourselves, and most of us were taught as children that we could <br/>
not be trusted.&quot; <br/>
(from &quot;How Children Learn&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
As to those voices, I&#39;ve got a quote for that too: Nietzsche said &quot;one <br/>
must still have chaos in oneself to be able to give birth to a dancing <br/>
star&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It give me great comfort.;)<br/>

on sale at liveandlearnconference.org. Great way to give yourself a <br/>
little boost of confidence when you need one.</div>

I do this also.  My 11 yo dd is a late sleeper so I do all my chores <br/>
in the am while she&#39;s a sleep and then we do stuff together in the <br/>
afternoon when she is up.<br/>
<br/>
It took me a while to work it out, trying to be quiet while vacuuming <br/>
can be a bit of a challenge.<br/>
<br/>
We love doing arts, neopets and video games together.  She got the new <br/>
pacman 3 for her PS2 for Christmas and we have been playing it <br/>
together since.<br/>
