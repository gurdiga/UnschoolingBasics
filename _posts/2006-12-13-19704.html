<div id="ygrps-yiv-1945257971">I have learned so much from this list and have seen the benefits of <br/>
unschooling even though I have only been doing it since this fall.  I <br/>
am wondering whether it is time to join another list for unschoolers <br/>
who want more specific questions asked during the course of their <br/>
unschooling journey.  Any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
I think I need to stay on this list as it helps pound in my brain the <br/>
reasons for unschooling and the general how-to&#39;s (and I need it pounded <br/>
in daily!), but I might benefit from being on another list as well for <br/>
those who are already unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-315659234">If you do a Yahoo Groups search for the word &quot;unschooling&quot; you&#39;ll find <br/>
tons of lists (I think it was something like 734).  You may be able to <br/>
find an &quot;unschooling&quot; Yahoo Group for your state or city.<br/>

<br/>
It IS nice to chat with folks that are already deep into the<br/>
unschooling journey sometimes.:) Not explaining anything can be<br/>
relaxing and all...<br/>
<br/>
There are lists under our &quot;links&quot; section as well as unschoolers<br/>
blogs. I enjoy popping onto unschooling blogs for my dose of<br/>
connection with likeminded (yet very different) families.  <br/>
