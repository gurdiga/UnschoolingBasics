Schooling: The Hidden Agenda<br/>
<br/>
I suspect that not everyone in this audience knows who I am or why I&#39;ve <br/>
been invited to speak to you to day. After all, I&#39;ve never written a <br/>
book or even an article about home schooling or unschooling. I&#39;ve been <br/>
called a number of things: a futurist, a planetary philosopher, an <br/>
anthropologist from Mars. Recently I was introduced to an audience as a <br/>
cultural critic, and I think this probably says it best. As you&#39;ll see, <br/>
in my talk to you today, I will be trying to place schooling and <br/>
unschooling in the larger context of our cultural history and that of <br/>
our species as well.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who are unfamiliar with my work, I should begin by <br/>
explaining what I mean by &quot;our culture.&quot; Rather than burden you with a <br/>
definition, I&#39;ll give you a simple test that you can use wherever you <br/>
go in the world. If the food in that part of the world is under lock <br/>
and key, and the people who live there have to work to get it, then <br/>
you&#39;re among people of our culture. If you happen to be in a jungle in <br/>
the interior of Brazil or New Guinea, however, you&#39;ll find that the <br/>
food is not under lock and key. It&#39;s simply out there for the taking, <br/>
and anyone who wants some can just go and get it. The people who live <br/>
in these areas, often called aboriginals, stone-age peoples, or tribal <br/>
peoples clearly belong to a culture radically different from our own.<br/>
<br/>
I first began to focus my attention on the peculiarities of our own <br/>
culture in the early 1960s, when I went to work for what was then a <br/>
cutting-edge publisher of educational materials, Science Research <br/>
Associates. I was in my mid-twenties and as thoroughly acculturated as <br/>
any senator, bus-driver, movie star, or medical doctor. My fundamental <br/>
acceptances about the universe and humanity&#39;s place in it were <br/>
rock-solid and thoroughly conventional.<br/>
<br/>
But it was a stressful time to be alive, in some ways even more <br/>
stressful than the present. Many people nowadays realize that human <br/>
life may well be in jeopardy, but this jeopardy exists in some vaguely <br/>
defined future, twenty or fifty or a hundred years hence. But in those <br/>
coldest days of the Cold War everyone lived with the realization that a <br/>
nuclear holocaust could occur literally at any second, without warning. <br/>
It was very realistically the touch of a button away.<br/>
<br/>
Human life would not be entirely snuffed out in a holocaust of this <br/>
kind. In a way, it would be even worse than that. In a matter of hours, <br/>
we would be thrown back not just to the Stone Age but to a level of <br/>
almost total helplessness. In the Stone Age, after all, people lived <br/>
perfectly well without supermarkets, shopping malls, hardware stores, <br/>
and all the elaborate systems that keep these places stocked with the <br/>
things we need. Within hours our cities would disintegrate into chaos <br/>
and anarchy, and the necessities of life would vanish from store <br/>
shelves, never to be replaced. Within days famine would be widespread.<br/>
<br/>
Skills that are taken for granted among Stone Age peoples would be <br/>
unknown to the survivors--the ability to differentiate between edible <br/>
and inedible foods growing in their own environment, the ability to <br/>
stalk, kill, dress, and preserve game animals, and most important the <br/>
ability to make tools from available materials. How many of you know <br/>
how to cure a hide? How to make a rope from scratch? How to flake a <br/>
stone tool? Much less how to smelt metal from raw ore. Commonplace <br/>
skills of the paleolithic, developed over thousands of years, would be <br/>
lost arts.<br/>
<br/>
All this was freely acknowledged by people who didn&#39;t doubt for a <br/>
moment that we were living the way humans were meant to live from the <br/>
beginning of time, who didn&#39;t doubt for a moment that the things our <br/>
children were learning in school were exactly the things they should be <br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d been hired at SRA to work on a major new mathematics program that <br/>
had been under development for several years in Cleveland. In my first <br/>
year, we were going to publish the kindergarten and first-grade <br/>
programs. In the second year, we&#39;d publish the second-grade program, in <br/>
the third year, the third-grade program, and so on. Working on the <br/>
kindergarten and first-grade programs, I observed something that I <br/>
thought was truly remarkable. In these grades, children spend most of <br/>
their time learning things that no one growing up in our culture could <br/>
possibly avoid learning. For example, they learn the names of the <br/>
primary colors. Wow, just imagine missing school on the day when they <br/>
were learning blue. You&#39;d spend the rest of your life wondering what <br/>
color the sky is. They learn to tell time, to count, and to add and <br/>
subtract, as if anyone could possibly fail to learn these things in <br/>
this culture. And of course they make the beginnings of learning how to <br/>
read. I&#39;ll go out on a limb here and suggest an experiment. Two classes <br/>
of 30 kids, taught identically and given the identical text materials <br/>
throughout their school experience, but one class is given no <br/>
instruction in reading at all and the other is given the usual <br/>
instruction. Call it the Quinn Conjecture: both classes will test the <br/>
same on reading skills at the end of twelve years. I feel safe in <br/>
making this conjecture because ultimately kids learn to read the same <br/>
way they learn to speak, by hanging around people who read and by <br/>
wanting to be able to do what these people do.<br/>
<br/>
It occurred to me at this time to ask this question: Instead of <br/>
spending two or three years teaching children things they will <br/>
inevitably learn anyway, why not teach them some things they will not <br/>
inevitably learn and that they would actually enjoy learning at this <br/>
age? How to navigate by the stars, for example. How to tan a hide. How <br/>
to distinguish edible foods from inedible foods. How to build a shelter <br/>
 from scratch. How to make tools from scratch. How to make a canoe. How <br/>
to track animals--all the forgotten but still valuable skills that our <br/>
civilization is actually built on.<br/>
<br/>
Of course I didn&#39;t have to vocalize this idea to anyone to know how it <br/>
would be received. Being thoroughly acculturated, I could myself <br/>
explain why it was totally inane. The way we live is the way humans <br/>
were meant to live from the beginning of time, and our children were <br/>
being prepared to enter that life. Those who came before us were <br/>
savages, little more than brutes. Those who continue to live the way <br/>
our ancestors lived are savages, little more than brutes. The world is <br/>
well rid of them, and we&#39;re well rid of every vestige of them, <br/>
including their ludicrously primitive skills.<br/>
<br/>
Our children were being prepared in school to step boldly into the only <br/>
fully human life that had ever existed on this planet. The skills they <br/>
were acquiring in school would bring them not only success but deep <br/>
personal fulfillment on every level. What did it matter if they never <br/>
did more than work in some mind-numbing factory job? They could parse a <br/>
sentence! They could explain to you the difference between a Petrarchan <br/>
sonnet and a Shakespearean sonnet! They could extract a square root! <br/>
They could show you why the square of the two sides of a right triangle <br/>
were equal to the square of the hypotenuse! They could analyze a poem! <br/>
They could explain to you how a bill passes congress! They could very <br/>
possibly trace for you the economic causes of the Civil War. They had <br/>
read Melville and Shakespeare, so why would they not now read <br/>
Dostoevsky and Racine, Joyce and Beckett, Faulkner and O&#39;Neill? But <br/>
above all else, of course, the citizen&#39;s education--grades K to <br/>
twelve--prepared children to be fully-functioning participants in this <br/>
great civilization of ours. The day after their graduation exercises, <br/>
they were ready to stride confidently toward any goal they might set <br/>
themselves.<br/>
Of course, then, as now, everyone knew that the citizen&#39;s education was <br/>
doing no such thing. It was perceived then--as now--that there was <br/>
something strangely wrong with the schools. They were failing--and <br/>
failing miserably--at delivering on these enticing promises. Ah well, <br/>
teachers weren&#39;t being paid enough, so what could you expect? We raised <br/>
teachers&#39; salaries--again and again and again--and still the schools <br/>
failed. Well, what could you expect? The schools were physically <br/>
decrepit, lightless, and uninspiring. We built new ones--tens of <br/>
thousands, hundreds of thousands of them--and still the schools failed. <br/>
Well, what could you expect? The curriculum was antiquated and <br/>
irrelevant. We modernized the curriculum, did our damnedest to make it <br/>
relevant--and still the schools failed. Every week--then as now--you <br/>
could read about some bright new idea that would surely &quot;fix&quot; whatever <br/>
was wrong with our schools: the open classroom, team teaching, back to <br/>
basics, more homework, less homework, no homework--I couldn&#39;t begin to <br/>
enumerate them all. Hundreds of these bright ideas were <br/>
implemented--thousands of them were implemented--and still the schools <br/>
failed.<br/>
<br/>
Within our cultural matrix, every medium tells us that the schools <br/>
exist to prepare children for a successful and fulfilling life in our <br/>
civilization (and are therefore failing). This is beyond argument, <br/>
beyond doubt, beyond question. In Ishmael I said that the voice of <br/>
Mother Culture speaks to us from every newspaper and magazine article, <br/>
every movie, every sermon, every book, every parent, every teacher, <br/>
every school administrator, and what she has to say about the schools <br/>
is that they exist to prepare children for a successful and fulfilling <br/>
life in our civilization (and are therefore failing). Once we step <br/>
outside our cultural matrix, this voice no longer fills our ears and <br/>
we&#39;re free to ask some new questions. Suppose the schools aren&#39;t <br/>
failing? Suppose they&#39;re doing exactly what we really want them to <br/>
do--but don&#39;t wish to examine and acknowledge?<br/>
<br/>
Granted that the schools do a poor job of preparing children for a <br/>
successful and fulfilling life in our civilization, but what things do <br/>
they do excellently well? Well, to begin with, they do a superb job of <br/>
keeping young people out of the job market. Instead of becoming <br/>
wage-earners at age twelve or fourteen, they remain consumers only--and <br/>
they consume billions of dollars worth of merchandise, using money that <br/>
their parents earn. Just imagine what would happen to our economy if <br/>
overnight the high schools closed their doors. Instead of having fifty <br/>
million active consumers out there, we would suddenly have fifty <br/>
million unemployed youth. It would be nothing short of an economic <br/>
catastrophe.<br/>
<br/>
Of course the situation was very different two hundred years ago, when <br/>
we were still a primarily agrarian society. Youngsters were expected <br/>
and needed to become workers at age ten, eleven, and twelve. For the <br/>
masses, a fourth, fifth, or sixth-grade education was deemed perfectly <br/>
adequate. But as the character of our society changed, fewer youngsters <br/>
were needed for farm work, and the enactment of child-labor laws soon <br/>
made it impossible to put ten-, eleven-, and twelve-year-olds to work <br/>
in factories. It was necessary to keep them off the streets--and where <br/>
better than in schools? Naturally, new material had to be inserted into <br/>
the curriculum to fill up the time. It didn&#39;t much matter what it was. <br/>
Have them memorize the capitals of every state. Have them memorize the <br/>
principle products of every state. Have them learn the steps a bill <br/>
takes in passing Congress. No one wondered or cared if these were <br/>
things kids wanted to know or needed to know--or would ever need to <br/>
know. No one wondered or ever troubled to find out if the material <br/>
being added to the curriculum was retained. The educators didn&#39;t want <br/>
to know, and, really, what difference would it make? It didn&#39;t matter <br/>
that, once learned, they were immediately forgotten. It filled up some <br/>
time. The law decreed that an eighth-grade education was essential for <br/>
every citizen, and so curriculum writers provided material needed for <br/>
an eighth-grade education.<br/>
<br/>
During the Great Depression it became urgently important to keep young <br/>
people off the job market for as long as possible, and so it came to be <br/>
understood that a twelfth-grade education was essential for every <br/>
citizen. As before, it didn&#39;t much matter what was added to fill up the <br/>
time, so long as it was marginally plausible. Let&#39;s have them learn how <br/>
to analyze a poem, even if they never read another one in their whole <br/>
adult life. Let&#39;s have them read a great classic novel, even if they <br/>
never read another one in their whole adult life. Let&#39;s have them study <br/>
world history, even if it all just goes in one ear and out the other. <br/>
Let&#39;s have them study Euclidean geometry, even if two years later they <br/>
couldn&#39;t prove a single theorem to save their lives. All these things <br/>
and many, many more were of course justified on the basis that they <br/>
would contribute to the success and rich fulfilment that these children <br/>
would experience as adults. Except, of course, that it didn&#39;t. But no <br/>
one wanted to know about that. No one would have dreamed of testing <br/>
young people five years after graduation to find out how much of it <br/>
they&#39;d retained. No one would have dreamed of asking them how useful it <br/>
had been to them in realistic terms or how much it had contributed to <br/>
their success and fulfilment as humans. What would be the point of <br/>
asking them to evaluate their education? What did they know about it, <br/>
after all? They were just high-school graduates, not professional <br/>
educators.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of the Second World War, no one knew what the economic <br/>
future was going to be like. With the disappearance of the war <br/>
industries, would the country fall back into the pre-war depression <br/>
slump? The word began to go out that the citizen&#39;s education should <br/>
really include four years of college. Everyone should go to college. As <br/>
the economy continued to grow, however, this injunction began to be <br/>
softened. Four years of college would sure be good for you, but it <br/>
wasn&#39;t part of the citizen&#39;s education, which ultimately remained a <br/>
twelfth-grade education.<br/>
<br/>
It was in the good years following the war, when there were often more <br/>
jobs than workers to fill them, that our schools began to be perceived <br/>
as failing. With ready workers in demand, it was apparent that kids <br/>
were coming out of school without knowing much more than the <br/>
sixth-grade graduates of a century ago. They&#39;d &quot;gone through&quot; all the <br/>
material that had been added to fill up the time--analyzed poetry, <br/>
diagramed sentences, proved theorems, solved for x, plowed through <br/>
thousands of pages of history and literature, written bushels of <br/>
themes, but for the most part they retained almost none of it--and of <br/>
how much use would it be to them if they had? From a business point of <br/>
view, these high-school graduates were barely employable.<br/>
<br/>
But of course by then the curriculum had achieved the status of <br/>
scripture, and it was too late to acknowledge that the program had <br/>
never been designed to be useful. The educators&#39; response to the <br/>
business community was, &quot;We just have to give the kids more of the <br/>
same--more poems to analyze, more sentences to diagram, more theorems <br/>
to prove, more equations to solve, more pages of history and literature <br/>
to read, more themes to write, and so on.&quot; No one was about to <br/>
acknowledge that the program had been set up to keep young people off <br/>
the job market--and that it had done a damn fine job of that at least.<br/>
<br/>
But keeping young people off the job market is only half of what the <br/>
schools do superbly well. By the age of thirteen or fourteen, children <br/>
in aboriginal societies--tribal societies--have completed what we, from <br/>
our point of view, would call their &quot;education.&quot; They&#39;re ready to <br/>
&quot;graduate&quot; and become adults. In these societies, what this means is <br/>
that their survival value is 100%. All their elders could disappear <br/>
overnight, and there wouldn&#39;t be chaos, anarchy, and famine among these <br/>
new adults. They would be able to carry on without a hitch. None of the <br/>
skills and technologies practiced by their parents would be lost. If <br/>
they wanted to, they could live quite independently of the tribal <br/>
structure in which they were reared.<br/>
<br/>
But the last thing we want our children to be able to do is to live <br/>
independently of our society. We don&#39;t want our graduates to have a <br/>
survival value of 100%, because this would make them free to opt out of <br/>
our carefully constructed economic system and do whatever they please. <br/>
We don&#39;t want them to do whatever they please, we want them to have <br/>
exactly two choices (assuming they&#39;re not independently wealthy). Get a <br/>
job or go to college. Either choice is good for us, because we need a <br/>
constant supply of entry-level workers and we also need doctors, <br/>
lawyers, physicists, mathematicians, psychologists, geologists, <br/>
biologists, school teachers, and so on. The citizen&#39;s education <br/>
accomplishes this almost without fail. Ninety-nine point nine percent <br/>
of our high school graduates make one of these two choices.<br/>
<br/>
And it should be noted that our high-school graduates are reliably <br/>
entry-level workers. We want them to have to grab the lowest rung on <br/>
the ladder. What sense would it make to give them skills that would <br/>
make it possible for them to grab the second rung or the third rung? <br/>
Those are the rungs their older brothers and sisters are reaching for. <br/>
And if this year&#39;s graduates were reaching for the second or third <br/>
rungs, who would be doing the work at the bottom? The business people <br/>
who do the hiring constantly complain that graduates know absolutely <br/>
nothing, have virtually no useful skills at all. But in truth how could <br/>
it be otherwise?<br/>
<br/>
So you see that our schools are not failing, they&#39;re just succeeding in <br/>
ways we prefer not to see. Turning out graduates with no skills, with <br/>
no survival value, and with no choice but to work or starve are not <br/>
flaws of the system, they are features of the system. These are the <br/>
things the system must do to keep things going on as they are.<br/>
<br/>
The need for schooling is bolstered by two well-entrenched pieces of <br/>
cultural mythology. The first and most pernicious of these is that <br/>
children will not learn unless they&#39;re compelled to--in school. It is <br/>
part of the mythology of childhood itself that children hate learning <br/>
and will avoid it at all costs. Of course, anyone who has had a child <br/>
knows what an absurd lie this is. From infancy onward, children are the <br/>
most fantastic learners in the world. If they grow up in a family in <br/>
which four languages are spoken, they will be speaking four languages <br/>
by the time they&#39;re three or four years old--without a day of <br/>
schooling, just by hanging around the members of their family, because <br/>
they desperately want to be able to do the things they do. Anyone who <br/>
has had a child knows that they are tirelessly curious. As soon as <br/>
they&#39;re able to ask questions, they ask questions incessantly, often <br/>
driving their parents to distraction. Their curiosity extends to <br/>
everything they can reach, which is why every parent soon learns to put <br/>
anything breakable, anything dangerous, anything untouchable up <br/>
high--and if possible behind lock and key. We all know the truth of the <br/>
joke about those childproof bottle caps: those are the kind that only <br/>
children can open.<br/>
<br/>
People who imagine that children are resistant to learning have a <br/>
nonexistent understanding of how human culture developed in the first <br/>
place. Culture is no more and no less than the totality of learned <br/>
behavior and information that is passed from one generation to the <br/>
next. The desire to eat is not transmitted by culture, but knowledge <br/>
about how edible foods are found, collected, and processed is <br/>
transmitted by culture. Before the invention of writing, whatever was <br/>
not passed on from one generation to the next was simply lost, no <br/>
matter what it was--a technique, a song, a detail of history. Among <br/>
aboriginal peoples--those we haven&#39;t destroyed--the transmission <br/>
between generations is remarkably complete, but of course not 100% <br/>
complete. There will always be trivial details of personal history that <br/>
the older generation takes to its grave. But the vital material is <br/>
never lost.<br/>
<br/>
This comes about because the desire to learn is hardwired into the <br/>
human child just the way that the desire to reproduce is hardwired into <br/>
the human adult. It&#39;s genetic. If there was ever a strain of humans <br/>
whose children were not driven to learn, they&#39;re long gone, because <br/>
they could not be culture-bearers.<br/>
<br/>
Children don&#39;t have to be motivated to learn everything they can about <br/>
the world they inhabit, they&#39;re absolutely driven to learn it. By the <br/>
onset of puberty, children in aboriginal societies have unfailingly <br/>
learned everything they need to function as adults.<br/>
<br/>
Think of it this way. In the most general terms, the human biological <br/>
clock is set for two alarms. When the first alarm goes off, at birth, <br/>
the clock chimes learn, learn, learn, learn, learn. When the second <br/>
alarm goes off, at the onset of puberty, the clock chimes mate, mate, <br/>
mate, mate, mate. The chime that goes learn, learn, learn never <br/>
disappears entirely, but it becomes relatively faint at the onset of <br/>
puberty. At that point, children cease to want to follow their parents <br/>
around in the learning dance. Instead, they want to follow each other <br/>
around in the mating dance.<br/>
We, of course, in our greater wisdom have decreed that the biological <br/>
clock regulated by our genes must be ignored.<br/>
<br/>
What sells most people on the idea of school is the fact that the <br/>
unschooled child learns what it wants to learn when it wants to learn <br/>
it. This is intolerable to them, because they&#39;re convinced that <br/>
children don&#39;t want to learn anything at all--and they point to school <br/>
children to prove it. What they fail to recognize is that the learning <br/>
curve of preschool children swoops upward like a mountain--but quickly <br/>
levels off when they enter school. By the third or fourth grade it&#39;s <br/>
completely flat for most kids. Learning, such as it is, has become a <br/>
boring, painful experience they&#39;d love to be able to avoid if they <br/>
could. But there&#39;s another reason why people abhor the idea of children <br/>
learning what they want to learn when they want to learn it. They won&#39;t <br/>
all learn the same things! Some of them will never learn to analyze a <br/>
poem! Some of them will never learn to parse a sentence or write a <br/>
theme! Some of them will never read Julius Caesar! Some will never <br/>
learn geometry! Some will never dissect a frog! Some will never learn <br/>
how a bill passes Congress! Well, of course, this is too horrible to <br/>
imagine. It doesn&#39;t matter that 90% of these students will never read <br/>
another poem or another play by Shakespeare in their lives. It doesn&#39;t <br/>
matter that 90% of them will never have occasion to parse another <br/>
sentence or write another theme in their lives. It doesn&#39;t matter that <br/>
90% retain no functional knowledge of the geometry or algebra they <br/>
studied. It doesn&#39;t matter that 90% never have any use for whatever <br/>
knowledge they were supposed to gain from dissecting a frog. It doesn&#39;t <br/>
matter that 90% graduate without having the vaguest idea how a bill <br/>
passes Congress. All that matters is that they&#39;ve gone through it!<br/>
<br/>
The people who are horrified by the idea of children learning what they <br/>
want to learn when they want to learn it have not accepted the very <br/>
elementary psychological fact that people (all people, of every age) <br/>
remember the things that are important to them--the things they need to <br/>
know--and forget the rest. I am a living witness to this fact. I went <br/>
to one of the best prep schools in the country and graduated fourth in <br/>
my class, and I doubt very much if I could now get a passing grade in <br/>
more than two or three of the dozens of courses I took. I studied <br/>
classical Greek for two solid years, and now would be unable to read <br/>
aloud a single sentence.<br/>
<br/>
One final argument people advance to support the idea that children <br/>
need all the schooling we give them is that there is vastly more <br/>
material to be learned today than there was in prehistoric times or <br/>
even a century ago. Well, there is of course vastly more material that <br/>
can be learned, but we all know perfectly well that it isn&#39;t being <br/>
taught in grades K to twelve. Whole vast new fields of knowledge exist <br/>
today--things no one even heard of a century ago: astrophysics, <br/>
biochemistry, paleobiology, aeronautics, particle physics, ethology, <br/>
cytopathology, neurophysiology--I could list them for hours. But are <br/>
these the things that we have jammed into the K-12 curriculum because <br/>
everyone needs to know them? Certainly not. The idea is absurd. The <br/>
idea that children need to be schooled for a long time because there is <br/>
so much that can be learned is absurd. If the citizen&#39;s education were <br/>
to be extended to include everything that can be learned, it wouldn&#39;t <br/>
run to grade twelve, it would run to grade twelve thousand, and no one <br/>
would be able to graduate in a single lifetime.<br/>
<br/>
I know of course that there is no one in this audience who needs to be <br/>
sold on the virtues of home schooling or unschooling. I hope, however, <br/>
that I may have been able to add some philosophical, historical, <br/>
anthropological, and biological foundation for your conviction that <br/>
school ain&#39;t all it&#39;s cracked up to be.<br/>
