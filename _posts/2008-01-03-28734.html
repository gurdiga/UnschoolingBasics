<div id="ygrps-yiv-1963841069">Hi I&#39;m Sarah, 24, from Ontario, Canada. I&#39;m happily engaged to df<br/>
Andrew, and mom to 4 yr old Lissa, and 10 wks pregnant with baby #2.<br/>
Our wedding is March 28, 2008. <br/>
<br/>
There, that takes care of the basics. <br/>
<br/>
I had decided before I met my fiance, that I wanted to homeschool my<br/>
daughter (she&#39;s from a previous relationship, btw), and lucky for me,<br/>
my fiance comes from a background where that is normal, accepted, and<br/>
encouraged -- Mennonite, actually (think Amish, but with cars). <br/>
<br/>
I unschool, frankly, because I&#39;m too lazy to be bothered with coming<br/>
up with lesson plans and worksheets, and making my extremely active<br/>
preschooler sit down and do them.  Too much energy, too much work.  I<br/>
figure if she wants to know something or needs to know it, she&#39;ll ask,<br/>
or figure it out for herself. <br/>
<br/>
I work from home, so I&#39;m home all day with the flexibility to do<br/>
whatever we feel like. Currently, I&#39;ve chosen to go to a college for a<br/>
year, and complete a diploma program (6 months to go!), but other than<br/>
that.. we are free and easy! <br/>
<br/>
So ya.. wedding planning, prenatal appointments, school for me, and<br/>
family time are all that take up my time. <br/>
<br/>
So that&#39;s me.. Hi all!</div>

<br/>
Frankly, this is disturbing.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling requires a lot more work and energy than worksheets and <br/>
lesson plans. It&#39;s just a different kind of work and energy. It&#39;s more <br/>
fun, to be sure. But &quot;lazy&quot; is not an adjective I use when talking <br/>
about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
And depending on your state, you may have to do a lot of record-keeping <br/>
to boot.<br/>
<br/>
Please don&#39;t think that unschooling is the lazy mom&#39;s way out. There <br/>
are &quot;lazy days&#39; to be sure, but it requires MUCH more in the way of <br/>
work and energy than school or school-at-home!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
   I figure if she wants to know something or needs to know it, she&#39;ll <br/>

<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
So...hands OFF parenting/homeschooling?<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with that.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s not unschooling---nor mindful parenting.<br/>

things with my child, like reading stories and playing with magnets,<br/>
and painting, and running, and getting messy and asking questions <br/>
than &quot;school-at-home&quot; that was what I thought of when I first<br/>
considered homeschooling. To me, what we do at home isn&#39;t &quot;school&quot; its<br/>
just life. Definitely energetic and work, but it doesn&#39;t seem like<br/>
work, because its a whole lot more fun. Which is what I understand the<br/>
spirit of unschooling to be -- lifelong learning, and not making it<br/>
&quot;work&quot; (dull, boring, and uninteresting) but &quot;fun&quot; (interesting,<br/>
exciting, and maybe hard, but worth it).<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And depending on your state, you may have to do a lot of record-keeping <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lucky for me, since my child has not been in the school system, no<br/>
record keeping required. If she at some point chooses to go to college<br/>
or university, then there are tests she can take to prove her<br/>
competency, at that point. <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Believe me, I know that quite well. However, it doesn&#39;t *seem* as<br/>
difficult to do as finding lessons and drilling children. Learning<br/>
through play and choice seems a heck of a lot more ... natural. Like<br/>
breathing. Breathing requires muscles to work too, but you don&#39;t<br/>
notice the energy and work required to breathe, simply because its<br/>
natural. That&#39;s the way we live.. learning is as natural as breathing<br/>
here.  <br/>

<br/>
Right.<br/>
<br/>
And many of us find that the hassle of getting kids ready for the bus <br/>
and completing homework assignments WAAAY more work than unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just that we&#39;ve had folks stop by the list before who figure that <br/>
unschooling means letting the kids do &quot;whatever&quot; while mom eats bonbons <br/>
and watches Oprah. I know moms who do that and call it unschooling, but <br/>
what it *is* is neglect. As if unschooling were meant for the lazy.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
But as she gets older, you&#39;ll probably find you need to be *more* <br/>
available and do *more* with the children, not less. In many ways, <br/>
school and school-at-home are easier.<br/>

<br/>
I agree and disagree.<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t the lazy Mum&#39;s way out, that is for SURE. But I<br/>
think it requires a lot more work to come up with lesson plans and<br/>
curriculum crap. Work, because trying to get kids to do some contrived<br/>
&quot;educational&quot; activity is usually going against the natural flow and<br/>
it takes SO much energy to try and coerce or manipulate other humans.<br/>
It&#39;s exhausting.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is so much easier even though it takes a lot of energy and<br/>
time and mindfulness. Easier, because you are going with the natural<br/>
flow of a day, of a person&#39;s interests etc.... It takes more<br/>
creativity, more mindfulness, more presence and willingness to pursue<br/>
something at the drop of a hat! But that&#39;s easier to me than trying to<br/>
&quot;teach&quot; other people . And it&#39;s a LOT more fun too.:)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thank you for that. You said it way better than I was expressing<br/>
myself, and that&#39;s exactly the way I feel. Exhausting some days, but<br/>
SOO much more fun, and the energy we were already devoting to our<br/>
connection as mother and daughter and exploring life (how much you<br/>
learn after looking at it from a toddler and preschooler&#39;s<br/>
perspective!!) was more than enough, that I didn&#39;t want to and<br/>
couldn&#39;t devote more to developing curriculum.  Bah.. let&#39;s learn<br/>
together, through shared experiences, and different experiences and<br/>
life in general. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-406708651">I agree with you.  I am a newbie to unschooling, (have been attempting<br/>
school-at-home for a year-and-a-half now), and I think that<br/>
unschooling is an adjustment because it requires one to be mindful,<br/>
alive in the present moment, always be on the ball, and open for<br/>
opportunities as they present themselves.  You can&#39;t just say, school<br/>
time is over and learning is done.  You have to be willing to answer<br/>
questions at all times, as soon as they present themselves, or you&#39;ll<br/>
miss the moment when the child is ripe for the information.  It&#39;s a<br/>
lifestyle change, a big adjustment, but I think it is going to be<br/>
worth it!<br/>

---------------------<br/>
 <br/>
Telling someone what they have to do and participating in what they do are very different things. If he likes his hair long and is uncomfortable at the idea of having it cut why do you feel a need to dictate his hair length to him? <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever made Simon or Linnaea get haircuts. I gave Simon a horrible haircut once, the bangs kept getting shorter and shorter, but it wasn&#39;t me telling him he needed a haircut, he didn&#39;t like his hair in his eyes. Poor fellow, it was a long time &#39;til his hair made it back to clouding his vision. It is hard to not see your children as a reflection of your parenting and attention. It is hard to walk into a store with a child whose hair looks unkempt, uncared for and not feel as though others will judge you wanting. I know, I have two children who love long hair but only occasionally want it brushed. David has a harder time with it than I do. My real failing is when they are willing to let me brush their hair I get so invested in the idea of getting out every tangle that I don&#39;t listen very well when they ask me to stop. The funny thing is that I have had people comment on how beautiful their hair is on days when all I see are tangles and<br/>
 matted messes. I can remember being the outsider, as well. I can remember going to La Montanita Coop in Albuquerque and seeing these two beautiful children, maybe they were 5 or 6, with visibly tangled hair, ringlets becoming dreadlocks hair, and thinking how wonderful that their parents were able to allow them that freedom. <br/>
 <br/>
Both Simon and Linnaea know that how they look may change how people respond to them, but they aren&#39;t particularly worried about it yet. When they are going to something where their lackadaisical approach to grooming may end up costing us somehow, like through customs and immigration or to the U.S. embassy to renew their passports, they are absolutely willing to be combed and curried. But I don&#39;t ask that they humor my fears in that area very often. It is very important to me that I recognize that they are the masters of their own bodies, their own hair and their own appearance. I am happy to give information, but am equally willing to have them choose to come up with their own conclusions about how they want to look.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1346832696">I love the this ridiculous image of trying to stuff an elephant into a matchbox.  I&#39;ve actually felt like this most of my life - trying to &#39;fit&#39; and not fitting at all!  I feel like I&#39;ve finally found my tribe, even though I have yet to meet even one unschooler in person.  I&#39;ve been eyeing with longing the different events so I could meet some of you, but I doubt there is even a possibility of that any time soon.  Firstly, I&#39;m not too anxious to go travelling alone with my 3 year old twin girls, and secondly, my dh still thinks there is nothing wrong with public school, and isn&#39;t currently open to spending any money on anything to do with unschooling.<br/>
   <br/>
  We just returned from a week at my sister&#39;s house, and my mind is on overdrive about all these issues again.  I thought before we left that I had put all my doubts to rest, but I understand now that this is a work in progress.  I am in huge deschooling mode myself, and likely will be for some time.  I need to cut myself some slack and remember that the first time I read anything/heard anything about unschooling was only about 4 months ago.  Even though everything in me shouted &#39;YES&#39; when I started reading John Holt, I still have a lot of years of experience of school and quite rigid upbringing to let go of.  Again, I thought I&#39;d dealt with most of my past stuff, but in light of doing something so outside the conventional box, there are definitely more layers coming up to work through.<br/>
   <br/>
  I find myself wishing that Waldorf or something like it felt like &#39;IT&#39; for us, because that would be so easy to explain to relatives.  My sister and her husband are very schooled, both veterenarians, and big believers education being the be all and end all.  We ended up having a discussion about homeschooling (I didn&#39;t even mention the word unschooling since I&#39;m sure you would have felt the shock waves all the way from that one!).  The discussion went okay, I felt pretty confident in what I believe for MY KIDS, and was aware that I wasn&#39;t at all trying to convince them about what to do with their daughter.  So...in my head while we were there I was okay, but then after leaving there my mind has just been going nuts with &#39;is this the right thing&#39;, &#39;are all these unschoolers nuts&#39;, &#39;do I really have the guts to tell people I&#39;m not sending my kids to school AND we&#39;re not planning to follow a curriculum??? and on and on it goes! :o)<br/>
   <br/>
  Anyway, just had to ramble about all that in the hopes that someone else has been through this process and made it out the other end with their convictions intact.  The night we got home my inbox had 112 emails in it from this group and it did my heart alot of good to be reminded about what we want for our kids...freedom to just BE who they are.  What a gift!!!  I look back on my school years and wish someone had the courage to yank me out of that prison and give me the gift of freedom too.<br/>
   <br/>
  Thanks for listening, and Happy New Year everyone,<br/>

  Hi Jodi,<br/>
               <br/>
                   Believe me, you are not alone in your thoughts and feelings. Our DD went to PS for 4 years before we decided to homeschool, out of everybody we know, I just knew, I would have bet my life on the fact that my ex- sister in-law would stand behind me, back me up...Boy, was I wrong. We used to talk everyday on the computer and on the phone. Now we hardly even speak and if we do, I do not bring up homeschooling. I have not even told her we are now Unschooling..... I used to get up wondering if we are doing the right thing, and everyday the kids show me a reason to say &quot;Yes, we are doing the right thing. I see how our kids are growing by leaps and bounds. Now I know we are doing the right thing<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-942997104">~~big believers education being the be all and end all...<br/>
 <br/>
~~Now we hardly even speak and if we do, I do not bring up homeschooling. <br/>
I have not even told her we are now Unschooling. .... <br/>
<br/>
These comments made me think of my younger sister. She&#39;s nine years younger <br/>
then me and memories of her doing homework with my mother are a big <br/>
reminder why unschooling is a MUCH better path.  Nothing ever was accomplished<br/>
except a very loud screaming match every night.  My sister&#39;s grades were <br/>
always failing till she dropped out after eighth grade.<br/>
 <br/>
She never strived to do much with her life until she was twenty-five, single,<br/>
and pregnant.  Something clicked at that point and she decided that she <br/>
needed to learn to read better and get a real career so she could provide<br/>
for her child.  She put herself into a junior college.  <br/>
 <br/>
After six or more years of college, she now works at a local public high school<br/>
teaching the ESE classes.  Today was her first day back after the Christmas<br/>
break.  She was telling me how her students have no drive nor interest in<br/>
learning anything.  She was also telling me how she will force her son not to<br/>
be like her students.  The part that amazes me is she can&#39;t see that she was<br/>
just like that and once she decided to learn, she did.<br/>
 <br/>
I have my days of &#39;doubt&#39; but then I come here, post, someone opens my eyes,<br/>
or I read the archives, and sometimes even review <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/</a><br/>
along with a few others.  Then I sit back and observe my children and see they<br/>
are doing just fine.  I never want to be like my mother screaming like a banshee<br/>
at her kids to clean up or do homework or anything else.<br/>
 <br/>
Not healthy for anyone.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1758215523">Thanks Oneida, it means alot to hear from people whose kids were in school and are doing much better since they&#39;ve been taken out.  I need to hear about that, because my girls will likely never be in school...so nothing to compare our unschooling experience to either.  I just know in my heart though that this is the right decision for our girls.  Thanks for the support :o)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-468048333">One thing that I find so engaging about unschooling is that I&#39;m learning as<br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m learning how to engage with, be with, just hang out with my kids in a<br/>
way I wish most adults would with each other.  I&#39;m practicing every day to<br/>
be present, to listen, and to keep my temper and be sane.  I&#39;m learning how<br/>
to come back from the Red Zone when I&#39;ve lost it.  I&#39;m practicing<br/>
mindfulness and consideration, both for my kids as well as for myself (if I<br/>
don&#39;t practice it for myself, I cannot appreciate it in my kids).<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m forcing my kids to &quot;learn&quot; math or writing, then the activities I&#39;m<br/>
engaged in at that point are coercion, and going over information I already<br/>
know (boring).  And since I&#39;m forcing them, I seriously doubt we&#39;ll explore<br/>
anything new together.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1713573867">My 12 yr old was in the hospital last spring following scoliosis<br/>
surgery... my mom bought some of the waterless shampoo (she found it<br/>
in a beauty supply store like Sally&#39;s)   I was amazed at how well it<br/>
worked and how little it takes!    We used it a few times, my mom then<br/>
used it after her foot surgery and then my SIL to be used it recently<br/>
following a surgery and there&#39;s still some left in the bottle! <br/>
Basically you just dampen the hair with it and rub with a towel... my<br/>
child had MAJOR back surgery so I was rubbing VERY gently and after it<br/>
was shiny and clean and smelled MUCH nicer!   I think it was less than<br/>
$5 for the bottle too so definitely a reasonable option!<br/>
