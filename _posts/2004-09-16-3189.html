<div id="ygrps-yiv-1474460125">Based on the recommendation in Valerie&#39;s book, I just read the book that<br/>
inspired her and I highly recommend it for anyone at any point in their<br/>
unschooling journey.  It&#39;s &quot;Summerhill A Radical Approach to Child Rearing&quot;<br/>
by A.S. Neill who&#39;s own history as a school misfit is fascinating and who<br/>
founded an alternative school in 1921 in England based on giving children<br/>
Freedom - the book is all about his observations and beliefs in how to best<br/>
help children grow up to be happy human beings.<br/>
<br/>
It was published in 1960 (I got it from the library) and I am blown away by<br/>
where this man was at on so many issues like feeding babies on demand and<br/>
co-sleeping at this time.  There is much fascinating and challenging in our<br/>
views of children in this book.  I&#39;m so glad I read it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for talking about it in your book, Valerie...<br/>

Joan (reading a lot lately)<br/>
