<br/>
Welcome! May I suggest that you read some of the older threads to <br/>
get a feel for unschooling. There&#39;s a lot of great information here <br/>
if you have some time to read it. :-) <br/>

 </span></blockquote>While it&#39;s the simplest thing in the world, since kids are born  <br/>
knowing how to do it, it&#39;s really, really hard to explain because  <br/>
people try to make the words fit the images they have of what  <br/>
learning looks like.<br/>
<br/>
Most of us have an image of there being a body of knowledge that&#39;s  <br/>
necessary to learn.<br/>
<br/>
Most of us have been through a process (school) of having it forced  <br/>
into us and for most of us that it was hard and/or boring, or at  <br/>
least took a 12 year commitment to do, so we *&quot;know&quot;* that it isn&#39;t  <br/>
easy to acquire that body of knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
Most of us have an image of how that body of knowledge gets into  <br/>
people: teachers, homework, drills, lectures, tests, grades ....<br/>
<br/>
If someone describes unschooling as the absence of that, then it  <br/>
sounds like neglect because we all &quot;know&quot; all of that is true and  <br/>
necessary.<br/>
<br/>
But unschoolers, without that, do go onto to college or go directly  <br/>
to personally fulfilling jobs. All without what we&#39;re certain they  <br/>
need in order to learn what is necessary.<br/>
<br/>
So what is unschooling? It&#39;s learning by living life. It&#39;s living a  <br/>
full, curious, free life with parents who support, encourage and help  <br/>
their kids pursue what interests them (while making opportunities  <br/>
available to expand their interests.)<br/>
<br/>
Unschooled children learn as a side effect of doing. No child needs  <br/>
to know how to hammer in nails perfectly before building something  <br/>
for their own pleasure. They pound. Then how they nails go in gives  <br/>
them feedback on how well they&#39;re doing, they adjust, they take in  <br/>
advice (if it seems useful) and figure out better ways to get where  <br/>
they&#39;re trying to go. As a side effect of doing something they want  <br/>
(building a birdhouse or just creating a chunk of wood with nails),  <br/>
they get better at the skills needed to do it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really, really hard to grasp the concept of a child growing up  <br/>
playing video and board and card games and spending and saving money  <br/>
and playing with art software and shopping with parents and cooking  <br/>
that they&#39;ll acquire the math they need. And yet they do. Will they  <br/>
have the same skills as kids in school? No. They will be weaker in  <br/>
some skills and stronger in others. Will those differences be  <br/>
detrimental? No, in fact helpful! Because the unschooled kids will  <br/>
have a deeper, more fundamental understanding of how numbers work,  <br/>
what contexts various concepts are used in and why. What they often  <br/>
lack is a concept of the formal notation. And that, they find, is  <br/>
easy to acquire. It only take minutes to show them how to formally  <br/>
write concepts they deeply understand. It&#39;s the kids in school who  <br/>
are severely handicapped. They&#39;re trying to absorb the notation on  <br/>
concepts they barely understand. It&#39;s hard for most. And it makes  <br/>
them shy away from those same concepts in the real world because it  <br/>
reminds them of their feelings of fear and aggravation in school. The  <br/>
*hope* is that by repeating the formal notation enough, they&#39;ll  <br/>
develop an understanding of how numbers work. But it so very often  <br/>
fails. (How many people fear math who&#39;ve gone through that process?)<br/>
<br/>
(I do want to mention that I was very good in math at school and went  <br/>
onto get a degree in engineering. The concept of getting all those  <br/>
years of math in from playing video games, et al, was flabbergasting  <br/>
to me. And yet my daughter decided to take her father&#39;s college  <br/>
Statistics class for fun at 13. And always had the best scores in the  <br/>
class. At 15 she&#39;s taking her 5th college math class (the first ones  <br/>
with a teacher other than her father) -- again for fun. And honestly  <br/>
she is not a math whiz! She&#39;s just a regular kid who mostly likes  <br/>
writing and drawing and pretending. She wasn&#39;t doing math puzzles  <br/>
under the covers with a flashlight in the middle of the night nor  <br/>
beating her father at chess ;-) What she has gained by living life is  <br/>
a fundamental understanding of how numbers work. *And* a freedom from  <br/>
fear of numbers and math!<br/>
<br/>
I should also mention the goal of unschooling is not good grades, or  <br/>
taking college classes at 13. It&#39;s pursuing interests and having fun  <br/>
and a joyful childhood.)<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s unschooling in a nutshell, anyway. It&#39;s okay if that sounds  <br/>
totally wacko to you. It *should* sound wacko coming from a school- <br/>
style-learning-is-necessary point of view! If unschooling could be  <br/>
explained in a few words in a way everyone could truly get what&#39;s  <br/>
going on and why it works there wouldn&#39;t need to be unschooling lists  <br/>
to help people! ;-)<br/>

 I guess I am misunderstanding...what, exactly, is unschooling?<br/>
 I thought it was another name for homeschooling.<br/>
 Pardon the ignorance!!!<br/>

 All poodles are dogs, but not all dogs are poodles.<br/>
<br/>
  All unschooling is homeschooling, but all homeschooling isn&#39;t <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
 Unschooling is legally a type of homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
 Unschoolers don&#39;t &quot;school-at-home&quot; nor do we gives tests or grades.<br/>
<br/>
  Unschooling accepts all learning as valid. Everything is connected: <br/>
you never know when one thing will lead to or connect with another! <br/>
Unschoolers know they *do* and will keep searching for those <br/>
connections.<br/>
<br/>
  Unschooling is natural learning. Humans are hard-wired to learn---we <br/>
crave it and seek it out. When you believe that, you&#39;re half-way to <br/>
understanding how it works.<br/>
<br/>
  Unschooling is understanding the difference between teaching and <br/>
learning. That&#39;s a HUGE hurdle to overcome before you can &quot;get&quot; <br/>
unschooling. (I can *teach* you everything *I* know about unschooling, <br/>
but unless you&#39;re willing to *learn* it, I&#39;m wasting my time and your <br/>
time.)<br/>
<br/>
 All children can unschool. Many parents can&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
  Unschooling requires a &quot;paradigm shift&quot; to make it work. And it works <br/>
best when you (the parent) are an active learner. And curious and <br/>
thoughtful and enthusiastic and interested and interesting.<br/>
<br/>
 It&#39;s about trust and respect and patience.<br/>
<br/>
  It helps if you can step OUT of the box. If you&#39;re OK going against <br/>
the flow and standing up for yourself (or at least your child).<br/>
<br/>
 I&#39;m sure others can add to this, but it&#39;s a start! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
