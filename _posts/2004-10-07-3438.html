<div id="ygrps-yiv-85019019">&lt;&lt;My feeling is that enforcing savings is<br/>
like enforcing anything else - you are depriving the child of the<br/>
opportunity to find out the value of out on her own, and really take <br/>
it to<br/>
heart. But - the bottom line for me is ownership. I am giving my <br/>
child<br/>
money, and if I am truly giving it, then he truly owns it, and I <br/>
have no<br/>
business telling him what to do with it. The whole point of the <br/>
exercise is<br/>
to give him a sense of control, and that purpose is diminished, in my<br/>
opinion, if there are strings attached.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Kate, I really like this. We have kind of &quot;done it all&quot;. At one <br/>
point, we gave our ds $3 allowance and told him to divide it: 1)save <br/>
2)spend and 3)give to someone who needs it more than you. We never <br/>
enforced it, though, and we&#39;ve let it go. Our boys do get allowance <br/>
(it&#39;s once a month, on the first of the month) and they are so <br/>
generous with it. Buy each other things, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Like Kate said, if we had insisted that they do this, it would lose <br/>
all meaning, right? (Think about demanding &quot;thank you&quot; etc.)<br/>
<br/>
We still try to make a point of &quot;showing&quot; them when we support a <br/>
charity or someone in need, and we certainly tell them about things <br/>
like paying off loans -- when we got our pool recently, we explained <br/>
that there wouldn&#39;t be any &quot;extra&quot; money for a while, etc. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say try to be as open and natural as possible - help them learn <br/>
as they live!<br/>
