I think  it was on the <br/>

so it helps me calm down and reminds me to go over and model it.  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

What a wonderful phrase.<br/>

I&#39;m SO sorry I missed the boat on the AP/LLL thang. Years and years of  <br/>
traditional parenting just screw with you so much! I was one of the *nicer*  <br/>
traditional parents, but NOTHING like this. Bummer.<br/>

As many say so often with unschooling, &quot;Damn! I wish I&#39;d learned about  this <br/>

When I saw you at the conference with Cameron (?) and I was priveliged to witness him tenderly giving you a kiss as you knelt beside him before the close of the conference, I was convinced that you had co-slept, nursed him til he was 5 or whatever....I&#39;m hoping that I will be as close to my kids as they become teenagers, as you seem to be to Cameron.<br/>

 <br/>
Thanks. I guess we&#39;re just proof that you CAN heal what damage has been  <br/>
done. He did sleep with us often, especially as an infant---but he also had a  <br/>
crib and a stroller and nursed only to nine months. We&#39;ve always had a good  <br/>
relationship, and I don&#39;t think that he lost trust in me---even while in school. <br/>
 <br/>
Unschooling, by far, has been the best thing to happen to our family. I  <br/>
can&#39;t imagine what would have happened had we not found unschooling. Traditional  <br/>
same old same old, I guess. I wish others could experience what we have. THUS, <br/>
 the conference! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m glad you got to witness that, Sharon. And thanks for bringing it to my  <br/>
attention. I read it to Cameron; he smiled! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
