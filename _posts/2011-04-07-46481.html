<div id="ygrps-yiv-1404755291">I&#39;ve mentioned before that my stepfather is a very negative person.  He just<br/>
breathes negativity, no matter how people around him react.<br/>
 Unfortunately because he is so negative most of the time, we typically<br/>
react negatively towards him, which doesn&#39;t make it any better (or worse<br/>
honestly).<br/>
<br/>
For the last 4 months, my partner, my son and I have been living in our tiny<br/>
little bedrooms, doing little other than watching TV or playing games (video<br/>
and board) together.  We moved here to help him after his stroke which<br/>
quickly resolved, but unfortunately couldn&#39;t afford to move out since we had<br/>
left our jobs behind in our old town.<br/>
<br/>
This morning my mother and stepfather left for an extended RV trip.  They&#39;re<br/>
going from here (Florida) to the Grand Canyon, to Maryland and back, taking<br/>
at least 2 months, but up to 4 months.<br/>
<br/>
The difference in just the last 12 hours is amazing.  Music has been playing<br/>
all day.  Arts and crafts are pulled out and spread across the kitchen<br/>
table.  Dinner was cooked together for the first time since we moved here.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sharing this mainly to show how much the emotional environment can<br/>
effect the physical environment.  I knew things would be different after<br/>
they left, I didn&#39;t realize how quickly though.<br/>
