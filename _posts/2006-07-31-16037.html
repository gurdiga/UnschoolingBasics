<div id="ygrps-yiv-419239216">I don&#39;t know from personal parenting experience, but having been the oldest <br/>
of 3 children, I know what it&#39;s like to feel the need to parent one&#39;s <br/>
siblings... One of the few things my mom did &quot;right&quot; was to notice that this <br/>
feeling that I needed to parent my brothers was kind of stressing me out and <br/>
making me resentful toward them.<br/>
<br/>
One day she &quot;released&quot; me from this duty - even though it was self-imposed. <br/>
She just pulled me aside and said something like, &quot;I know how tough it is to <br/>
take care of 2 young boys - I want you to have fun during your childhood and <br/>
leave the boys to me to worry about. This is such a big responsibility for <br/>
another little person to have to take on and I want you to know I don&#39;t <br/>
expect you to take care of them.&quot; That&#39;s not word for word, but you get the <br/>
picture...<br/>
<br/>
She never expected me to take care of them but I think through her requests <br/>
for help when the boys were younger I just assumed the role of secondary <br/>
caregiver and never realized that it was always a choice to help out or not. <br/>
Just having my mom say that to me (even though it wasn&#39;t her imposing the <br/>
&quot;chore&quot; on me in the first place) made me feel free to let go of the need to <br/>
parent my brothers.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m interested in other RU parents&#39; response to this because my son is going <br/>
to be the oldest and I don&#39;t want to fall into this pattern either...<br/>

She will model you and it sounds as if she may be trying to help. Someday  <br/>
she will be a mom too but not yet. <br/>
 <br/>
Food is a great way to help them feel better. When they seem to be getting  <br/>
grumpy offer (or just put out)some finger foods. And/Or paint,paper,glue,  <br/>
puppets etc.. The dollar store has bird house kits. They are great. I bought  like <br/>
20 of them so any time the want they can build them. Mostly the 6 and 4  <br/>
build and the 2 yr old paints. Great deal for a dollar.<br/>
