<div id="ygrps-yiv-1681319510">Yahoo is doing maintenance on yahoogroups tonight, starting at 9pm <br/>
PST. So if your posts don&#39;t come through, that might be the <br/>
explanation. Only a small percentage of groups will be affected, so we <br/>
might be fine. I just wanted to remind everyone in case posts don&#39;t <br/>
show up....they should come up after the maintenance period is over.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Ren</div>
