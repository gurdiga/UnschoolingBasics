<div id="ygrps-yiv-802105231">We see the assumption made over and over - that kids will choose what<br/>
is not<br/>
good for them and, therefore, a parent&#39;s job is to set limits to make<br/>

WILL sometimes choose what is not good for them. Do WE always do what<br/>
we know is good for us?<br/>
<br/>
Why shouldn&#39;t parents control their children&#39;s lives, making sure<br/>
they only do what the parents think is &quot;good for them?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It is because the &quot;choosing&quot; is really important in the child&#39;s<br/>
psychological development, both individually, to move toward self-<br/>
actualization in his/her own life, and socially, to function as a<br/>
valuable member of a democratic society. And if a person can&#39;t make<br/>
&quot;real&quot; choices, then his/her so-called freedom is not real. It is a<br/>
delusion to believe you are free, if your choices are limited to<br/>
those that someone else has determined are healthy for you.<br/>
<br/>
We see too many people, these days, willing to give up their own<br/>
freedoms, in exchange for protection or security or even just for<br/>
convenience. A society composed of compliant people is orderly, and,<br/>
for some, reassuring and comforting - this is the allure of a<br/>
dictator! Independence and liberty are messy and risky. This is as<br/>
true within a family as it is for society as a whole.<br/>
<br/>
Many parenting books talk about offering children limited choices,<br/>
such as asking: &quot;Do you want the red shirt or the blue shirt today?&quot;<br/>
The point of these &quot;choices&quot; is not to give real choice, but to fake<br/>
the kid out - to give the child the illusion of having a choice. This<br/>
is done for the convenience of the parent whose motivation is to get<br/>
the child dressed quickly, usually in order to more efficiently get<br/>
out the door to school or daycare. But this kind of control over<br/>
children&#39;s lives, carried on throughout childhood at home and at<br/>
school, often leads to dangerous levels of passivity and apathy,<br/>
unengaged teenagers who don&#39;t think for themselves and are too easily<br/>
led by others, or to passive resistance or even active rebellion,<br/>
which we see in teenagers who flaunt their rejection of all authority<br/>
and engage in dangerous antisocial behaviors. Unschoolers are<br/>
striving for something different - our goal is raising truly free<br/>
children who will grow up to insist on thinking for themselves and<br/>
will never be easily controlled by others. Unschoolers around the<br/>
world are demonstrating that parents and kids, together, can, in<br/>
fact, set up a home environment that supports true freedom and<br/>
provides MANY options - real choices, not &quot;fake&quot; ones.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling parents do not abdicate parental responsibility, they do<br/>
not deprive their children of their protection and care, but they do<br/>
go far beyond most parents, now or historically, in choosing support<br/>
of freedom over parental control and convenience, as they offer real<br/>
choices in an environment that does not focus on limiting a child&#39;s<br/>
options, but provides nearly boundless opportunity. A friend of mine<br/>
once said that unschooling can feel a lot like jumping off a cliff,<br/>
not knowing if you have wings to fly. And I think it can look just<br/>
about that foolish, from outside, too! But there are unschooled kids<br/>
soaring all over the place, these days, and all we have to do is look<br/>
at them, look at their energy and love of life and learning, watch as<br/>
they pursue their dreams with confidence and gusto, to know that John<br/>
Holt was right when he said, &quot;Children do not need to be made to<br/>
learn to be better, told what to do or shown how. If they are given<br/>
access to enough of the world, they will see clearly enough what<br/>
things are truly important to themselves and to others, and they will<br/>
make for themselves a better path into that world than anyone else<br/>
could make for them.&quot;*<br/>
