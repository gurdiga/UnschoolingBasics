(mailto:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>)    The &quot;mother&quot; of all unschooling e-groups. &lt;g&gt; A bit &quot;in your <br/>

we&#39;re willing to let you take it more slowly if  you need it. We&#39;ll still <br/>

&lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
There are other unschooling groups---there&#39;s radicalunschooling and oh---I  <br/>
don&#39;t know---several others. I was on all of them at one time (41 e-lists!), <br/>
but  I&#39;ve whittled it down to a dozen or so now.<br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;re a small subset of homeschoolers. They guess there are about 2 million  <br/>
children being homschooled----wild guess, as there are no real numbers. I&#39;ll  <br/>
make an even wilder guess (pulled right out of my butt!) that there are  <br/>
probably 10-12,000 children whose parents who call themselves  unschoolers, with <br/>
only about 4-5,000 of those actually understanding the  philosophy and putting <br/>
it into practice. (We&#39;re so cool, some folks just want to  be *called* <br/>
unschoolers! &lt;G&gt;)<br/>
 <br/>
Most &quot;school-at-home&quot; with curricula and &quot;school hours&quot;---sometimes even  <br/>
&quot;recess&quot;. The smallest group of homeschoolers is probably unschoolers. But it&#39;s  <br/>
my guess that it&#39;s the fastest growing group----especially among homeschoolers <br/>
 looking for a &quot;better way&quot;. <br/>
 <br/>
I think a lot of attachment parents come to unschooling naturally first  <br/>
(without the stopover into school or school-at-home). But I&#39;m guessing that most  <br/>
unschoolers come from school-at-home that didn&#39;t work the way they thought it  <br/>
would. Burn out, too much structure, seeing unschoolers have more fun. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
We&#39;re winning them over by the truckload! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-69100325">U-D is gentle compared to freethinking_unschoolers. lol. <br/>
<br/>
We came to unschooling from attachment parenting also. Trust not <br/>
schooling makes the world go round. Fear used to make my world stop. <br/>
I like the trust ride much better. It was a long path to get here <br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
I guess number of children unschooled is a sad commentary on the USA <br/>
and trust in relationships. Severe understatement to say the least. <br/>
Now the whole world doesn&#39;t trust USA, the bully. <br/>
<br/>
But every individual makes a difference. It starts with one, and <br/>
there have been many ahead of me.<br/>
