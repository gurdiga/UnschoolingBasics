    I was wondering where do I find a teacher to evaluate my children&#39;s <br/>
work? I am<br/>
not sure. My mother who was a public school teacher for 25 years now <br/>
homeschools<br/>
my adopted brother and sister but has them tested by my Aunt who is <br/>
also a<br/>
teacher I was also adopted but went to private school but because my <br/>
siblings<br/>
are drug effected they require a lot of assistance. I choose to teach <br/>
my<br/>
children at home and I am now glad I did with all of the shootings and <br/>
such<br/>
going on around us. but back on track I just wanted to know because I <br/>
either<br/>
have to have them take the proficency test or have the work evaluated <br/>
by a<br/>
certified teacher. My children are 7, 5, and 3  5 yo has special needs <br/>
( had<br/>
brain surgery last year)<br/>
<br/>
Thank you<br/>

evaluated.  <br/>
