<div id="ygrps-yiv-1423448510">Hi Lisa, <br/>
<br/>
Nance Confer and I have unschooled in Florida for oh, 15 years or so and gradually slogged through all the legal options, misinformation from the state association, DOE and homeschool email lists, etc.  She&#39;s on this list too and probably will answer, but feel free to write me offlist ant time, just click reply here and then change the pull-down menu at &quot;To:&quot; so it comes to me directly and not the whole list.  I&#39;m in Tallahassee and Nance is near Indian River or somewhere south -- glad to meet you, JJ<br/>

Dr Allison Cameron:Is it so wrong for them to want to have a normal child?<br/>
It&#39;s normal to want to be normal.<br/>
House: Spoken like a true circle queen. See, skinny socially privileged<br/>
white people get to draw this neat little circle, and everyone inside the<br/>
circle is normal, anyone outside the circle should be beaten, broken and<br/>
reset so they can be brought into the circle. Failing that, they should be<br/>
institutionalized or worse, pitied.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-454419898">Unschooling is legally the same as homeschooling so whatever you&#39;ve been<br/>
doing, that&#39;s not changing. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1287821777">For FL, whether you currently have your Home Education Program registered with your county or you have your children enrolled in an umbrella school, there is nothing different, legally, that you need to do in order to live as unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
If you have the annual evaluations under the county method, you will need to find an evaluator who gets unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If you are using the umbrella option, you need to find one that fits with unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Write me off-list if you want more info.<br/>
