<div id="ygrps-yiv-1189450872">We&#39;re tagging along with dh and will be here Tuesday, Wednesday and<br/>
Thursday. It&#39;s been years since I was here last and was looking for<br/>
fun inexpensive things to do. :-) Meeting friends is always great.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1355145168">I&#39;m in Denver.  I&#39;ve lived here for 10 years, but strangely enough I&#39;ve <br/>
only been to Boulder a handful of times.  <br/>
<br/>
Boulder has lots of open space and many hiking trails.  I don&#39;t know <br/>
specifics, but it should be easy to figure out just by asking around.  <br/>
<br/>
Pearl Street Mall is a pedestrian mall that&#39;s fun for people watching.  <br/>
Fun shops, bookstores, and cafes.  <br/>
<br/>
Celestial Seasonings is nearby.  They have a free tour that runs every <br/>
half hour to hour or so if you&#39;re interested in sampling some teas and <br/>
seeing how they&#39;re bagged and packaged.  <br/>
<br/>
I have too many things going on during this week already, otherwise I <br/>
would drive up to meet you.  Have a fun visit!  <br/>
