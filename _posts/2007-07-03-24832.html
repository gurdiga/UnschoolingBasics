<div id="ygrps-yiv-760896870">Hi all--<br/>
<br/>
I would like some suggestions for dealing with my 7 y/o son. He is a <br/>
sensitive child and often gets extremely upset about things that <br/>
many others would not. I can often predict what these things will be-<br/>
-and sometimes I&#39;m caught totally off-guard. An example that is <br/>
happening right now is this: my younger son (4) lost his swimming <br/>
goggles and so today I bought him a new pair similar to the others <br/>
but not exactly the same--the former looked like tropical fish <br/>
around the outside of the eye and the new ones look like sharks. I <br/>
came home and gave them to my younger son and it immediately set off <br/>
my older one. <br/>
<br/>
He sees it as unfair that his brother got new goggles and sees it as <br/>
his brother getting something new and his being left out vs. it <br/>
being fair b/c they both have goggles. Now, I understand that it is <br/>
hard to see your brother get something new even if its a <br/>
replacement. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, what happens is that I validate, listen,--hard not to get <br/>
something new at the same time, feels unfair to you, you really wish <br/>
you could get a new pair too, etc. But it seems to go on forever. <br/>
There&#39;s crying and stomping out of the room, re-engagement and more <br/>
crying, he won&#39;t come up with solutions and rejects what I offer. <br/>
And it seems to go on and on. Sometimes I feel like my presence just <br/>
keeps him going and if I could politely disappear for a bit, it <br/>
would die down. It sometimes seems that just my presence adds fuel <br/>
to the fire because it takes two to tango. <br/>
<br/>
So, any suggestions regarding what I could do, what I&#39;m not doing? <br/>
Maybe I&#39;m wishing too hard for the sitution to resolve and not <br/>
giving it time? And thoughts to the two of us having some space in a <br/>
way that doesn&#39;t make him feel rejected? Anyone else who feels like <br/>
their remaining engaged just ramps things up? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1101284676">Sometimes there needs to be space for the feelings to come out <br/>
without any other words from anyone else. Sometimes, I&#39;ll just sit <br/>
and LISTEN, not say a word, not validate, not offer thoughts, ideas, <br/>
suggestions, just sit quietly, open body language (no crossing arms <br/>
or legs or whatever, just relaxed, comfortable, breathing). Until <br/>
the feelings can come out, DS can&#39;t hear anything else. Once it&#39;s <br/>
all out, THEN I can validate, suggest, ask questions, etc. Talking <br/>
too soon just fuels another go-round. It&#39;s a fine balance but one <br/>
that we&#39;re getting better at over time.<br/>
<br/>
Also, sometimes the immediate focus is NOT the issue. It&#39;s just the <br/>
last drop in the bucket that causes it to overflow. For example, it <br/>
might not be the goggles themselves but something else going on that <br/>
day (too much busyness, an ongoing issue with sibling getting lots <br/>
of mom&#39;s time, hunger, etc). The goggles just hit at the wrong time <br/>
and the bucket overflows. Then, in all good intention, you start <br/>
talking - validating, suggesting, helping. BUT it&#39;s too much - <br/>
you&#39;re pouring more water into an overflowing bucket. Gotta let the <br/>
flow of water die down first then start talking.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the time, DS will go stomp up the stairs (wood floors so the <br/>
stairs make a great lot of noise) and slam his door (sometimes <br/>
repeatedly). Eventually, he comes down and can talk again (or he&#39;ll <br/>
ask me to come up to talk). If he heads in the direction of <br/>
physically hurting someone (me usually), I&#39;ll head him off and <br/>
suggest he go stomp because intentionally hurting someone is right <br/>
out. He can go stomp, he can yell, he can hit pillows, he cannot do <br/>
injury. How and where he chooses to vent is up to him. If he wants, <br/>
I&#39;ll go with him or stay with him and just wait it out, quietly.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1210511763">Anyone else who feels like their remaining engaged just ramps things up? <br/>
My family (parents) and my sitter both feel that my emotional engagement fuels the flames of my 3 kids&#39; emotional traumas. I think, though, that if we must err, we are better to over-validate than dismiss. And you are doing a great job, I can tell! But I do believe that our intuition is very valuable, and if you wonder whether you&#39;re somehow &#39;ramping him up&#39; or if you need space I&#39;d listen to your heart.  If many of his episodes are predictable, can you prepare him ahead? (I realize that you may have tried this already.) <br/>
For example: &quot;Your brother really needs his goggles to enjoy the water.  I am thinking we might need to replace them. What do you think?&quot;  If he says &quot;No, that&#39;s not fair, I&#39;d want something new.&quot;  You could say, &quot;Well, if you lost yours I&#39;ll bet that you&#39;d really hope that we could replace them. How do you think we could solve this problem?&quot;  He may generate solutions, or use it as a chance to process feelings ahead, or to put himself in his brothers&#39; place (empathic skills, problem solving skills, etc)--all of which may be easier when the &#39;unfair&#39; new goggles haven&#39;t been bought yet.  You could make a plan with his input--even best, use his plan--then help him remember the plan as the challenge occurs.  You could also have a dialogue about how space/solitude/quiet time can help people get perspective on a disagreeable situation.  Such as, &quot;You know, sometimes I find that when I am upset over something, after I have talked about it, a quiet or private time can help me.  It<br/>
 isn&#39;t about getting away from someone, it&#39;s really about getting my self quiet. Maybe just to rest or think. Have you ever felt like that?&quot;  If he is interested, you could propose a plan, such that either of you could say, &quot;I think that I would like some quiet time now.&quot;  Or whatever works for you.  The important things for our family are mainly 2 issues:  that both people involved like the plan, and that it is discussed before it is a heated-up acute event.  Now in a way this begs the original question of whether our empathic involvement can ramp-up a difficult time for a child.  But these are ways that I try to dilute some of the predictable melt-downs and explore solutions with the child. Feedback?<br/>
