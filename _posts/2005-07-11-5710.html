<div id="ygrps-yiv-23276456">Thank you, Ren. I appreciate what you said. In my stronger moments I<br/>
totally agree:) In my weaker moments, with unsupportive people talking<br/>
to me I get lost. It isnt that my family is just being mean, they have<br/>
all been brainwashed for so long they dont know any different. I told<br/>
the state my 17 year old has decided to quit schooling. In a way, I wish<br/>
I hadnt done that. I know they have called me. I missed the call. Maybe<br/>
they will give me an option I wont want to refuse. This child is so<br/>
wounded. He has gotten employment and has kept it for over a year now.<br/>
He is never late and went through a hell of an innitiation by older<br/>
boys. They were so mean. On top of that he is sensitive about his<br/>
learning disability/ability to be different. He is pulling away from me<br/>
because he is 17 and yet is still very injured by life. I keep letting<br/>
him know I am here. He has made some unhealthy drug-related choices<br/>
lately. I think he is back on track. He has had therapy and refuses to<br/>
go now. The family and I did an intervention and buoyed him up. We all<br/>
told him how much he means to us and that we love him and are here for<br/>
him. I hope our hearts are enough and yet I am aware, at times love<br/>
doesnt deter a person from hurting themselves. So I have my awareness<br/>
level up surrounding him. I think from all the brainwashing that he<br/>
wouldnt accept a diploma/graduation ceremony, etc. from unschooling<br/>
because he didnt &quot;earn&quot; it. :( It wouldnt seem &quot;real&quot; because it didnt<br/>
come from the usual black and white thought forms that the majority use<br/>
regarding schooling. It does take a leap of faith after all the<br/>
brainwashing to think there could be some sort of alternative ways. It<br/>
is sad because I think if he could believe it may be a form of healing<br/>
on a level that would benefit him. I am here. My heart is with his. <br/>
I am so grateful that this list, and you Ren, are here. It is helping me<br/>
mend my broken heart so that I can be here in the &quot;now&quot; for my<br/>
kids/family. Glad you and yours are safe. Blessings for you, Michele<br/>
