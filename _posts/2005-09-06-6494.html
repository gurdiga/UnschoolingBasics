<div id="ygrps-yiv-1325334496">This is my daughter&#39;s first year NOT going back to school (yippee!).  <br/>
We&#39;ve been deschooling big time, I see some healing, I&#39;ve embraced <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
In MA we have to provide an annual assessment (standardized test, <br/>
portfolio of work samples or a narrative report, mutually agreed upon <br/>
by supt and parents).  I will be doing a narrative.  I had to list <br/>
what &quot;books&quot; etc we will be using (but don&#39;t intend to replicate <br/>
school at home).  Right now dd is heavily into playing online World <br/>
of Warcraft.  She&#39;s on the computer from the moment she gets up until <br/>
it&#39;s time for bed, except for eating or sometimes at night she joins <br/>
us downstairs if we&#39;re watching a movie, or if we have an errand.   <br/>
We&#39;re planning on going to a few &quot;not back to school&quot; things in the <br/>
next couple of weeks.   We talk during the day, she shares things <br/>
she&#39;s discovered in the game, I&#39;m amazed at what she&#39;s &quot;learned&quot; <br/>
about the game.   We&#39;ll be going out to connect with local <br/>
homeschoolers/unschoolers as the fall progresses, plus any of the <br/>
events/&quot;field trips&quot; that are starting to happen that appeal to her.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here comes the BUT.....<br/>
<br/>
Because my state requires that I keep them informed of her &quot;academic <br/>
progress&quot; I&#39;m always mindful of how I&#39;m going to do that, this being <br/>
our first year (and I know it don&#39;t have to submit it until next <br/>
Aug).  She hates math because of school and even though I put on <br/>
my &quot;curriculum&quot; list (that I submitted with my letter of intent)the <br/>
books/DVDs/online sources we will be using, I have no intention of <br/>
reviewing the things she had trouble with last year (common <br/>
denominators, fractions, etc).  History will be easy, language arts <br/>
and science do-able.  She hates to read for pleasure, but I can even <br/>
work around that (books on tape in the car, reading TO her or just <br/>
listing books that she &quot;read&quot; - she forgets most of what she&#39;s read <br/>
when &quot;forced&quot; to read a book in school during &quot;sustained silent <br/>
reading&quot; time and I know she CAN read, so who cares how many, if any, <br/>
books she&#39;s read.  They just like to see a list).  I worried a lot <br/>
until I submitted my letter, not knowing how they would respond, and <br/>
I got my letter of &quot;approval&quot; back a week after I submitted it.<br/>
<br/>
Now that THAT is accomplished, I&#39;m thinking about my narrative (I <br/>
don&#39;t want to be writing it last minute and have been jotting done <br/>
things that we&#39;ve done, talked about etc, more as a memory jogger for <br/>
me). I&#39;ve got a lot of samples from unschooling sites, a few from <br/>
some unschoolers, lists of educationese wording to use.  This is more <br/>
of a vent, and maybe a request for some &quot;suggestions&quot; from those who <br/>
have to submit something more &quot;substantial&quot; in their states.   I want <br/>
to be ready to submit my narrative in a way that will satisfy the <br/>
town, but I almost feel like I have to make things up or lie.   Part <br/>
of this is because we are at the beginning of this new life style and <br/>
I&#39;m very mindful of not pushing her to &quot;do this or that&quot; in the name <br/>
of &quot;homeschooling&quot;.   Just call it my &quot;control freak&quot; factor, wanting <br/>
to be prepared.  I&#39;m trusting the process, and I know many of you <br/>
have always unschooled, so maybe can&#39;t relate to my situation, but I <br/>
also know there are others out there who HAVE pulled a kid out of <br/>
school (just finished 6th grade), so I&#39;m not looking for the pep <br/>
talks about unschooling, there have been a lot of great posts, all of <br/>
which I&#39;ve embraced (and continue to embrace).   This isn&#39;t about my <br/>
view of unschooling, only about the requirements of my state.  <br/>
<br/>
So, if you can get through this rambling post, I&#39;d appreciate any <br/>
thoughts.  Thanks for letting me vent!<br/>

You can use the unschooler&#39;s recordkeeping form that I put in the files area of this list - use it as a &quot;tickler&quot; file, to remind you to jot things down that you can then use, later, to write up your narrative. It&#39;ll let you keep records while not having to think in terms of school subjects. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;ll lose the formatting in email - you can get it in Word in the files area of this list:<br/>

I&#39;ve been too busy READING and &quot;deworking&quot; (I&#39;ve NEVER not worked, <br/>

Contact the MA unschoolers list---Rue??? Kathryn??? You are SURROUNDED by extremely knowledgable unschooling moms there!!!<br/>
 <br/>
There&#39;s no need to reinvent the wheel! Ask locals--- you may just be able to borrow one of their old copies and use it as a guideline.<br/>

Thanks Kelly,<br/>
I&#39;m on that group as well and, of course posted this there.  I&#39;ve <br/>
received some good responses, in fact, I&#39;ve connected in the past by <br/>
email with both Rue and Kathryn, Rue sent me her narrative, which is <br/>
a big help.  I also realized I&#39;ve got a lot of info saved in word <br/>
that I&#39;ve been collecting since I started this journey to <br/>
unschooling, I need to go back and organize it. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s more of an internal mental mindset issue for me, knowing in my <br/>
heart that unschooling is what&#39;s best for my child, and also knowing <br/>
that I will do whatever is necessary to satisfy my town.  Because I <br/>
believe I&#39;m the first unschooler (but I&#39;m not telling the super <br/>
that!) in my town, and the only homeschooler above elem level, I&#39;m <br/>
breaking new ground.  And it&#39;s also about &quot;not knowing&quot; - I couldn&#39;t <br/>
relax once I had submitted my LOI in Aug until I heard back (got <br/>
my &quot;approval&quot; one week later!   Short and sweet).  I was afraid <br/>
they&#39;d make an issue of me wanting to do a narrative (ie try to <br/>
suggest testing).  So, until I submit my first narrative next year, I <br/>
won&#39;t know how they&#39;ll be about it.    I tend to overanalyze <br/>
sometimes!<br/>
<br/>
I had MANY conversations/emails with her teachers, guidance counselor <br/>
(what do they DO to actually help kids???!!??), vice principal, <br/>
principal all last year, kept getting &quot;yessed&quot; to death, falling on <br/>
deaf ears.  I emailed the guidance counselor, vp, p to let them know <br/>
I would be homeschooling, reiterated my concerns about her learning <br/>
style not working, she needs more time to finish a task to <br/>
completion, concerned about increase in migraines, will benefit with <br/>
more one on one time blah blah blah, thanked them and the teachers <br/>
for their efforts with her last year etc etc.  I included the email <br/>
with my LOI.  The super doesn&#39;t know my child from the next one <br/>
(although he DOES know me as I volunteer to play piano with the <br/>
school choruses when needed, the music teachers are friends, my <br/>
degree is in music, done it for MANY years even long before I had my <br/>
dd).  I like to think it made it easier for him to send <br/>
the &quot;approval&quot; letter back, sort of a &quot;the rest of the story&quot; <br/>
moment.  Plus the super&#39;s office is right in the middle school <br/>
building.<br/>
<br/>
Consider this part of MY deschooling!  I have what I need, am meeting <br/>
more and more unschoolers with older kids, and some who have pulled <br/>
kids out, not unschooled from the beginning.  I&#39;ll be fine and I&#39;m <br/>
glad to have these groups as a place to vent my thoughts and concerns.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone for your input!<br/>

That really is hard! Especially if you ere very involved in her schooling and the whole school mind-set thingy.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking about this a lot lately because that&#39;s what my talk is about at the conference---leaving school for unschooling. I&#39;m green with envy---all you guys who are smart enough to figure this out sooner rather than later. Understanding the philosophy BEFORE your children are even school age!  DAMN!<br/>
 <br/>
When you are thoroughly entrenched in the school lifestyle, it&#39;s so hard to get out! The paradigm shift is sooo important---and often more difficult because your child&#39;s friends are are still in school, you know teachers, you&#39;re friends with parents of school kids---you&#39;re surrounded by SCHOOL!  <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s like it takes more mind-control or something. Like you can&#39;t just &quot;react&quot;---you have to stop. And think. And act *better* than before.<br/>
 <br/>
The best remedy seems to be to surround yourself with other unschoolers---and the more radical they are, the better! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Hang out witth Rue & Kathryn! You can&#39;t get much more radical than that!<br/>
 <br/>
And get Rue&#39;s fabulous new book!!! _Parenting a Free Child_!!!<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know if I was &quot;very&quot; involved &lt;g&gt; but I was in touch with the <br/>
school in some manner weekly (email to teachers, notes, phone calls) <br/>
all trying to get them to understand and on this end, helping my dd <br/>
to survive the rest of the year.   The only other way I&#39;m involved <br/>
with the schools as I said is to help my fellow musicians (ie music <br/>
teachers) by playing piano for them.   I do that for THEM, NOT for <br/>
the school!  I&#39;ve never been involved any other way because I worked <br/>
full time (other than the occassional donation to a class party in <br/>
elem school etc).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad you&#39;ll be talking about those who leave school after being <br/>
there for a while to unschool.  It&#39;s very different from those who <br/>
have done it from day one.  I&#39;ve learned so much from those who have <br/>
lived it, but I&#39;d like to see more for those of us coming to <br/>
it &quot;later in life&quot; so to speak.  I&#39;ll be helping at local homeschool <br/>
info nights presenting &quot;our story&quot;, hoping it will be valuable to <br/>
those who are in the place I was at a couple of years ago exploring <br/>
homeschooling, finding unschooling and having no clue (I&#39;ve come a <br/>
long way!).<br/>
<br/>
Already have Rue&#39;s book!  Ordered it right away as I can&#39;t be at the <br/>
conference this year.... haven&#39;t had much time to read it this week, <br/>
but I will.   I also heard from Kathryn (we&#39;ve spoken in the past) <br/>
and we&#39;re going to connect.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It&#39;s like it takes more mind-control or something. Like you can&#39;t <br/>
 </span></blockquote>just &quot;react&quot;---you have to stop. And think. And act *better* than <br/>

<br/>
Yes, definitely takes intentional thought at times!<br/>
  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The best remedy seems to be to surround yourself with other <br/>
 </span></blockquote>unschoolers---and the more radical they are, the better! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m finding them little by litte, unfortuately most aren&#39;t nearby by <br/>
but not so far away that it&#39;s not do-able.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Hang out witth Rue & Kathryn! You can&#39;t get much more radical than <br/>
