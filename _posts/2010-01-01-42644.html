&gt; We eat as healthy a diet of foods as we can.  Natural Traditional Diet is the closest I can &quot;label&quot; it.  www.westonaprice.org is a site that talks about a lot of this, but again, we don&#39;t follow any one way--we follow what &quot;feels&quot; right to our family and what feels right to our bodies.<br/>

When talking about families, its easy to drift into &quot;we&quot; mode as if the group of individuals were a homogeneity. That&#39;s confusing when talking about something like radical unschooling where individual differences matter. <br/>
<br/>
There are some families where, in terms of food, &quot;we&quot; is easier - some families seem to be more compatible in terms of dietary needs than others. Its important to recognize that there are other families where there&#39;s no &quot;we&quot; where diet is concerned. <br/>
<br/>
 My kids, for instance, have vastly different diets. Currently they reflect the differences between a young man who has always been easy going where food is concerned, and a young girl who has a veeeeeerrrry conservative diet and very small apetite! Its challenging to meet the dietary needs and wants and wishes of all of my family members on a slim budget, it takes some creativity, but its doable.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think anyone has been offended. The main issue is that you&#39;ve presented a lot of &quot;we&quot; decisions that include your kids, without talking about how that happens, How the natural interests and curiosity of children to try what they see - on tv, at others homes, in grocery stores - play out amidst that &quot;we&quot;. No-one is necessarily challenging your parenting, but its not in the least bit clear how it relates to radical unschooling, and radical unschooling is what this list is about. <br/>
