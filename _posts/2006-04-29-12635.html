<div id="ygrps-yiv-1421401157">Hiya Gals!        <br/>
 <br/>
Ok, we&#39;ve been out of school for 3 months and the charter school for 2<br/>
months now.  I&#39;ve been letting the boys (14, 10 and 7) just do whatever they<br/>
are interested in doing, when they want to do it.  We&#39;ve torn down the chore<br/>
chart and I just made a chart that says if anyone feels like doing this or<br/>
this it&#39;s worth $.50 or whatever, to give them an opportunity if they are<br/>
interested to earn some allowance (and help me with some of the housework)<br/>
If it gets done, great!  If not, oh well.  I am struggling with not saying<br/>
no.  I am struggling with letting go of expectations and rules.  I am doing<br/>
much better and I am way more laid back then I was at first but it&#39;s REALLY<br/>
hard to let go of conventional parentingl stuff!!!  In the time that I&#39;ve<br/>
eased up on rules and stuff, their rooms have become disaster zones (with<br/>
half of my dishes missing in them), they are almost constantly in front of<br/>
the tv or the computer, rarely going outside to play unless I keep strongly<br/>
suggesting it (which I shouldn&#39;t be doing)  They have become rude and they<br/>
expect to get what they want when they want it.  My 10 year old thinks he<br/>
can just say whatever he wants to me and he&#39;s been hitting his brother (the<br/>
7 year old).  The 14 year old has been instigating a lot of fights between<br/>
the 2 younger boys.  They don&#39;t bathe, and they get FILTHY!!!  They have<br/>
become lazy and sullen, they stay up all night and sleep half the day.  This<br/>
is not how I pictured unschooling to be---I know there is to be an<br/>
adjustment period and a deschooling period--for all of us, but it&#39;s getting<br/>
so bad that at times that I just want to put them back into school so I can<br/>
have a moments peace!  I think the thing that bothers me the most is the<br/>
fact that they are all becoming very rude and mean.  Is this normal???  It&#39;s<br/>
as if they see that mom is backing off and they are just testing to see how<br/>
far they can go before they get me to say no or become angry.  It&#39;s also as<br/>
if they WANT limits and rules and are causing anarchy to get them back.  I<br/>
try not to react, or if I do react I just say--thats not nice, why would you<br/>
need to talk to me like that???  It&#39;s like they don&#39;t care.  They weren&#39;t<br/>
like this when every minute of their lives were structured and bogged down<br/>
with rules and expectations.  Please. tell me this is normal and will<br/>
pass---if it isn&#39;t/doesn&#39;t I&#39;m afraid we won&#39;t make it as an unschooling<br/>
family!!!  Oh, and I&#39;m not so worried about the TV/video games and stuff, I<br/>
expected that---it&#39;s more their attitudes, fighting and rudeness that I am<br/>
worried about everyday.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2141073215">Sounds normal to me, what&#39;s the rule? a month at least for every year  <br/>
in school. So your 14 yo might just well need a full year of  <br/>
deschooling. That&#39;s if he had no preschool! We faced (and still do) a  <br/>
lot of testing just to see if I&#39;m serious. And part of it was a  <br/>
reflection of what they got at school and perhaps internalizing some  <br/>
of the stuff from me.<br/>
Ya know, give it time. I wouldn&#39;t appreciate calling me names or  <br/>
hitting people. Maybe someone else can give more advice on that,  <br/>
since mine are young enough they aren&#39;t offended by me saying that we  <br/>
don&#39;t hurt people, Maybe Sandra Dodd&#39;s dot com about fighting? You  <br/>
can only hit if you tried words first.<br/>
Also take a look at how you are responding to them, is it with  <br/>
exasperation in your voice? Anger, frustration? Martyrdom? All that  <br/>
will affect how they will act because they know.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this is coming out right, I&#39;m in such a hurry but I&#39;d hate for  <br/>
you to give up so early.<br/>

<br/>
The goal is to live by principles. An easier method of getting to  <br/>
principles from rules is to ask yourself &quot;Why not?&quot; and say yes more  <br/>
rather than, as you found out, basically saying they can do whatever  <br/>
they want.<br/>
<br/>
Your boys&#39; reactions are why people say kids need strict limits! ;-)  <br/>
When limited kids are given no limits they do tend to go wild! But  <br/>
kids who&#39;ve had no arbitrary limits all along have no more reason to  <br/>
go wild than (reasonable) adults do.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d say yes, that&#39;s what they&#39;re doing. It&#39;s a reaction to being  <br/>
limited. It&#39;s a reaction to having the limits disappear all of a sudden.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It&#39;s also as<br/>
&gt; if they WANT limits and rules and are causing anarchy to get them  <br/>
&gt; back.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes and no. They aren&#39;t used to making decisions for themselves. It&#39;s  <br/>
scary and feels like you&#39;re saying &quot;Whatever. I don&#39;t care what you do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They may feel like they want the stability of the limits and rules  <br/>
but what they really want is stability. Since their *only experience*  <br/>
is rules and no rules, they&#39;re going to think at least the stability  <br/>
of rules feels good. If you&#39;d only experienced rotten fruit and  <br/>
unripe fruit, you might think unripe was better. But that&#39;s not the  <br/>
only two choices.<br/>
<br/>
And fortunately rules and no rules aren&#39;t the only choices! :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I<br/>
&gt; try not to react, or if I do react I just say--thats not nice, why  <br/>
&gt; would you<br/>
&gt; need to talk to me like that???<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That statement and question puts them in control. They&#39;re feeling  <br/>
upset so maybe their goal *is* to be not nice! It&#39;s natural to be  <br/>
irritable to others when we feel irritable. And it doesn&#39;t matter why  <br/>
they&#39;re feeling like they need to treat you like that.<br/>
<br/>
Give them information. Stand up for yourself but then move onto  <br/>
meeting their needs. Say in an informational tone, &quot;I don&#39;t like to  <br/>
be treated that way, now what is it you want,&quot; or, &quot;I can&#39;t  <br/>
understand you when you&#39;re screaming at me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Tell them up front this isn&#39;t working and you want to find a way to  <br/>
help this work for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Having all the dishes disappear is a real life limitation. Think  <br/>
about it as a contract. They can eat in their rooms *if* they bring  <br/>
their dishes back. It&#39;s not a rule to be enforced. It&#39;s an agreement.  <br/>
You can bring food to them, but then make it your own responsibility  <br/>
to go get the dishes. If they take food to their rooms and can&#39;t  <br/>
remember to bring their dishes back, then they need to eat in the  <br/>
kitchen. Unlike a mom-rule it&#39;s always open to them trying to live up  <br/>
to the contract if they want to try again.<br/>
<br/>
It might be hard to see how that&#39;s different than a rule that says  <br/>
&quot;You can but you broke the rule and now you can&#39;t.&quot;. It isn&#39;t a  <br/>
punishment for breaking rules. But it is like the agreements we have  <br/>
in society: If you pay for things *then* you can take them from the  <br/>
store; *if* you pass the driver&#39;s test *then* you can drive; *if* you  <br/>
behave in socially acceptable ways *then* you can stay in the  <br/>
restaurant.<br/>
<br/>
It might be hard to see how it&#39;s different than bribery. &quot;If you do  <br/>
your homework, then you can have an hour of TV.&quot; That&#39;s using our  <br/>
power to make someone do what we want in exchange for something they  <br/>
want. The two aren&#39;t connected. But behaving well in a restaurant  <br/>
*is* connected with the privilege of eating there.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First, they aren&#39;t *your* dishes only because everyone is using <br/>
them, right?  The kids need to understand that if they don&#39;t return <br/>
the dishes, there will eventually be nothing left in the kitchen to <br/>
eat on.  Returning dishes to the kitchen should be considered a <br/>
house courtesy, not necessarily a rule.  I do understand though.  My <br/>
oldest dd&#39;s room is downstairs (split-level home) and her room is a <br/>
hang-out place for all 3 of my children.  I never have need to go <br/>
down there, but occasionally I carry something down only to find <br/>
lots of dishes and trash around.  I immediately round up the younger <br/>
kids (who are the only ones home during the week so they can&#39;t blame <br/>
big sister) and ask them to please help me carry these things <br/>
upstairs.  I&#39;ll laugh and say something like &#39;What a mess!  Can you <br/>
imagine Claire coming home this weekend to this room?  Are you <br/>
trying to freak her out??&#39;  The kids laugh with me and then help me <br/>
clean up.  Nobody gets angry.  We&#39;re working as a team so the job <br/>
gets done quickly.<br/>
<br/>
As for their rooms, I don&#39;t know how you used to keep order in their <br/>
rooms before unschooling but my experience with my children is that <br/>
a very messy room is so overwhelming to clean that they simply don&#39;t <br/>
know where to start.  I help my kids clean their rooms, usually <br/>
doing the majority of the work for my son.  First, I tell them I <br/>
want to help clean their rooms that day and when they hit a stopping <br/>
point in their playing, to let me know so I can start.  I carry in a <br/>
trash bag and then give simple directions.  In my son&#39;s room, I <br/>
always start with picking up the books that are laying everywhere.  <br/>
I actually say it out loud, &quot;Let&#39;s start by gathering all the books <br/>
and putting them on the shelf.&quot;  My son is happy to do this because <br/>
it&#39;s simple and easy.  In my daughter&#39;s room however, we start with <br/>
picking up all the dirty clothes laying everywhere, then move to the <br/>
cups that have rolled underneath her bed.  *laugh*  <br/>
<br/>
I have confidence that my children will be able to do what they need <br/>
to do when they need to do it.  In the meantime, I&#39;m happy to be a <br/>
help.  Oh, the last time I helped my son clean his room, he found a <br/>
funky hip-hop radio station that we listened to while we worked.  It <br/>
was fun!<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t been radical unschooling very long though we&#39;ve been sort <br/>
of unschooly in our parenting approach all along.  However, I don&#39;t <br/>
tolerate rudeness just for the sake of being mean.  I completely <br/>
understand that we all get into bad moods sometimes, but when my <br/>
kids start saying mean things to me, I just get down on their level <br/>
and tell them something like this, &quot;I understand you are feeling <br/>
angry or frustrated inside, but I don&#39;t deserve to be your verbal <br/>
punching bag.  How can I help you feel better?&quot;  I don&#39;t let them <br/>
treat each other disrespectfully either.  If I hear someone using a <br/>
really ugly tone, I redirect and try to smooth over the situation.  <br/>
For my son, that usually means that his sister has pushed all his <br/>
buttons and he just needs to be alone but she won&#39;t let him alone.  <br/>
He&#39;s an introvert and needs to have time alone to recharge.  My <br/>
daughter is an extrovert, so even &#39;bad&#39; attention is energetic for <br/>
her.  She does that on purpose because she wants to &#39;be&#39; with <br/>
someone and when he&#39;s not in the mood to interact, he&#39;ll tell her to <br/>
let him alone in his room for a while.  I&#39;ve been trying to help her <br/>
understand that when he asks to be alone, he really means it and she <br/>
needs to come and find me when she needs to be with someone and he <br/>
isn&#39;t available.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want my children to think they can do anything they want <br/>
anytime they want because that&#39;s not realistic.  We live in a <br/>
society that has certain limitations and expectations and allowing <br/>
them to believe they are above those &#39;rules&#39; isn&#39;t going to help <br/>
them out in the long run.  For example, it&#39;s just NOT acceptable to <br/>
hit someone.  The only exception is in defense, and it&#39;s only to get <br/>
away, not to beat someone to a pulp.  We&#39;re black belts so we&#39;ve <br/>
learned that in martial arts.  If my children get physical, I get <br/>
involved immediately to diffuse the situation.  IF they have reached <br/>
that point, then letting them work it out on their own obviously <br/>
isn&#39;t working.  Adults can be arrested for harrassment or assault <br/>
and battery.  We simply must find better coping techniques than <br/>
resorting to physical violence.  Why is your older son hitting your <br/>
younger son?  Is it to force the younger son to give in to <br/>
something?  Like letting the older son play a certain video game, or <br/>
watch a certain tv show?  Is he just bored so he&#39;s trying to find <br/>
stimulation?  Find out exactly WHY the older one is hitting and then <br/>
help him find a better way to get what he wants than resorting to <br/>
the &#39;I&#39;m bigger and/or older and am more important.&#39; <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I hope some of this helps a little.  I haven&#39;t been in your <br/>
shoes so my advice might not be worth much at all.  :)<br/>

Actually, before we decided to unschool, they really weren&#39;t limited all<br/>
that much except for <br/>
the fact that they had to get up for school the next day so games and TV had<br/>
to go off.  I&#39;ve tried<br/>

kids who&#39;ve had no arbitrary limits all along have no more reason to  <br/>
go wild than (reasonable) adults do. <br/>
 <br/>
Actually, this is where I&#39;ve had a hard time letting go of saying no.  I&#39;ve<br/>
eased up considerably<br/>
but I&#39;ve had a hard time just letting things be (at times) I do still say no<br/>
once in a while, mostly<br/>
when it involves my old parental ideas of too much of something (too much<br/>
snacks, for one) or<br/>
 sitting back and letting them stay up all night---I&#39;ve had a hard time with<br/>
that---basically, I tell them<br/>
it&#39;s time to go to bed--but they can keep the tv on if they are quiet---and<br/>
as soon as they think I am asleep<br/>
they get up and play---which I haven&#39;t stopped them unless they get too loud<br/>
or rowdy.  I guess the problem <br/>
is that they think they are getting away with something, rather than knowing<br/>
that I am allowing it by not interfering.<br/>
If they know that I am (relatively) ok with it, maybe it wouldn&#39;t be that<br/>
big a deal anymore?   I would prefer that they sleep at<br/>
 night, however--but that is just my hangup I have to get over. <br/>
<br/>
 . &gt; It&#39;s<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;  as if they see that mom is backing off and they are just testing to  <br/>
&gt;  &gt; see how<br/>
&gt; &gt;  far they can go before they get me to say no or become angry.<br/>
<br/>
 &gt;&gt; I&#39;d say yes, that&#39;s what they&#39;re doing. It&#39;s a reaction to being  <br/>
 &gt;&gt; limited. It&#39;s a reaction to having the limits disappear all of a sudden.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>They haven&#39;t all totally disappeared at once---but I am considerably more<br/>
laid back about<br/>
many things.  I&#39;ve basically taken my &quot;pick your battles&quot; issues---tv, video<br/>
games, sleep---and<br/>
relaxed my expectations on them greatly.   <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It&#39;s also as<br/>
&gt; if they WANT limits and rules and are causing anarchy to get them  <br/>
&gt; back.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; and no. They aren&#39;t used to making decisions for themselves. It&#39;s  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>scary and feels like you&#39;re saying &quot;Whatever. I don&#39;t care what you do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They may feel like they want the stability of the limits and rules  <br/>
but what they really want is stability. Since their *only experience*  <br/>
is rules and no rules, they&#39;re going to think at least the stability  <br/>
of rules feels good. If you&#39;d only experienced rotten fruit and  <br/>
unripe fruit, you might think unripe was better. But that&#39;s not the  <br/>
only two choices.<br/>
<br/>
And fortunately rules and no rules aren&#39;t the only choices! :-)&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
One day my 7 year old was upset about a clay figure he had made- -he had<br/>
accidentally stepped <br/>
on it and ruined it.  He was nearly crying and I was comforting him and he<br/>
said he wished he could swear.<br/>
I told him---go ahead.  So, he looked at me with big eyes, astounded that I<br/>
would say it&#39;s ok and with a big grin said &quot;shit!&quot;  <br/>
I laughed and asked him if he felt better--he said yes.  I told him that I<br/>
would prefer he not swear---just like he prefers that I don&#39;t<br/>
swear---but if he felt the need to do so, then come and talk to me.  Now,<br/>
everyone in a while, he&#39;ll come up to me and say--mom I need to swear<br/>
and I&#39;ll talk to him about what happened--after we talk about it and he gets<br/>
it out I&#39;ll ask if he still feels the need to swear, sometimes<br/>
he does and sometimes he doesn&#39;t.  I guess that shows that somethings are<br/>
working!!??<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I<br/>
&gt; try not to react, or if I do react I just say--thats not nice, why  <br/>
&gt; would you<br/>
&gt; need to talk to me like that???<br/>
<br/>
 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That statement and question puts them in control. They&#39;re feeling  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>upset so maybe their goal *is* to be not nice! It&#39;s natural to be  <br/>
irritable to others when we feel irritable. And it doesn&#39;t matter why  <br/>
they&#39;re feeling like they need to treat you like that. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Yes, you are absolutely right, I didn&#39;t even look at it that way.  I guess I<br/>
was thinking<br/>
I was taking a more &quot;gentle&quot; approach but instead I was making myself a<br/>
victim--which<br/>
is certainly the wrong approach to take.  I can be firm without being harsh<br/>
and commanding. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Give them information. Stand up for yourself but then move onto  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>meeting their needs. Say in an informational tone, &quot;I don&#39;t like to  <br/>
be treated that way, now what is it you want,&quot; or, &quot;I can&#39;t  <br/>
understand you when you&#39;re screaming at me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Tell them up front this isn&#39;t working and you want to find a way to  <br/>
help this work for everyone. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I guess my problem is that I&#39;ve been taking this upon myself to do without<br/>
including the boys<br/>
in the plan.  Instead of communicating that this is a &quot;life&quot; change we are<br/>
doing for the betterment<br/>
of everyone, I&#39;ve just tried to change my behavior and approaches to things<br/>
without including them<br/>
in the plans.  In order for this to work, everyone needs to be part of the<br/>
plan. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Having all the dishes disappear is a real life limitation. Think  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>about it as a contract. They can eat in their rooms *if* they bring  <br/>
their dishes back. It&#39;s not a rule to be enforced. It&#39;s an agreement.  <br/>
You can bring food to them, but then make it your own responsibility  <br/>
to go get the dishes. If they take food to their rooms and can&#39;t  <br/>
remember to bring their dishes back, then they need to eat in the  <br/>
kitchen. Unlike a mom-rule it&#39;s always open to them trying to live up  <br/>
to the contract if they want to try again. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
This is really more of an issue with the 14 year old.  The younger boys will<br/>
ask, can we eat upstairs and<br/>
I&#39;ll say yes, as long as you bring your dishes down, which they generally<br/>
do---sometimes they need a<br/>
gentle reminder.  The 14 year old doesn&#39;t ask, which is fine, but when I&#39;m<br/>
doing the dishes and notice that 3 of <br/>
my bowls are missing and 5 glasses, I&#39;ll ask him to get the stuff out of his<br/>
room and he&#39;ll bring me one of each<br/>
and tell me that&#39;s all there is.  I know the stuff isn&#39;t anywhere else, so<br/>
I&#39;ll ask him one more time to check and he&#39;ll<br/>
get mad and say there are no more dishes in his room.  From that point I<br/>
usually either try to reason with him (I have 6 bowls, and <br/>
3 are missing and no one else has them so maybe they are in your room but<br/>
you missed them?)  he then gets angry and says<br/>
I never believe him---which is true because he does lie about it.  Finally,<br/>
I had enough the other day, after calling for dishes, everyone<br/>
brought stuff down from their rooms.  I knew he had a lot more in his room<br/>
than he brought down so I nicely asked him to go check again.  <br/>
He refused so I asked if I could go look, maybe a fresh set of eyes would<br/>
help.  He said FINE, but then said to me that I would be <br/>
 sorry when I saw that there was nothing in there and didn&#39;t believe him.  I<br/>
went in his room, and I found all the dishes I was missing<br/>
and then some!  The real problem is, they weren&#39;t hidden or shoved under<br/>
stuff that would make it hard for him to find, they were all <br/>
right out in the open, he couldn&#39;t miss them.  So, why bring down some and<br/>
say there is no more when he easily could have just<br/>
brought down all and avoided all of this.  I just grabbed everything and<br/>
took it all downstairs and stated again, if you can&#39;t bring down the <br/>
dishes when you are done, they don&#39;t eat in your room.  I don&#39;t have a<br/>
problem with you eating up there, as long as I get the stuff back<br/>
so I can wash it.  I let it go from there. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It might be hard to see how that&#39;s different than a rule that says  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;You can but you broke the rule and now you can&#39;t.&quot;. It isn&#39;t a  <br/>
punishment for breaking rules. But it is like the agreements we have  <br/>
in society: If you pay for things *then* you can take them from the  <br/>
store; *if* you pass the driver&#39;s test *then* you can drive; *if* you  <br/>
behave in socially acceptable ways *then* you can stay in the  <br/>
restaurant.<br/>
<br/>
It might be hard to see how it&#39;s different than bribery. &quot;If you do  <br/>
your homework, then you can have an hour of TV.&quot; That&#39;s using our  <br/>
power to make someone do what we want in exchange for something they  <br/>
want. The two aren&#39;t connected. But behaving well in a restaurant  <br/>
*is* connected with the privilege of eating there &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ll have to talk to the boys about this, this is a good approach.  <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for all your advice, I appreciate it!  I know I still have a lot to<br/>
work on<br/>
myself!<br/>

  I was just talking to Ren about shutting down the list. It can be <br/>
exhausting answering the same questions---but that&#39;s not a problem, <br/>
really. We&#39;ve gotten pretty good at it and can almost do it in our <br/>
sleep---PLUS it solidifies unschooling to *us* when we put the same <br/>
thoughts into words over and over. That also makes it easier to <br/>
defend/explain when we have to deal with in-laws, extended family, <br/>
neighbors, strangers, etc. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  But when people want to attack the list---THAT THEY JOINED <br/>
VOLUNTARILY---well, that just gets old. The list IS what it is. Because <br/>
it *works* and because it&#39;s what we (Ren and I) want it to be.<br/>
<br/>
  Posts like yours (and Kristie&#39;s) make it worth it. I *know* the list <br/>
is needed. I know because I was where you (and others) are now at one <br/>
time. Several people gave and gave and gave of themselves to help me <br/>
and Ren and Deb and Rue to the point we are now: confident and <br/>
unwavering.<br/>
<br/>
  Ren told me to chill out and let it die---aGAIN! &lt;g&gt; She knows and *I* <br/>
know it happens regularly on a list that makes people uncomfortable <br/>
with their previous and long-held beliefs. It&#39;s reallly not easy. <br/>
Simple, but not easy.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I would just like to say something about this group.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I joined a very short while ago and think I speak for many when I say<br/>
&gt; that I<br/>
&gt; have found it IMMENSELY useful. It has helped our family thrive, it<br/>
&gt; has<br/>
&gt; assisted me to become a much more relaxed mum, resulting in a big<br/>
&gt; shift in<br/>
&gt; our family and a breakthrough today, with my husband.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Without this group I wouldnt have found links to many websites that<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; given me advice and encouragement and information when I have needed<br/>
&gt; it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I havnt really posted much and probabally wont, because I&#39;ve managed<br/>
&gt; to find<br/>
&gt; alot of information for myself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I enjoy reading the posts and want to say thank you to everyone for<br/>
&gt; offering<br/>
&gt; your time. It was something I hadnt really thought about before last<br/>
&gt; week<br/>
&gt; and I kind of took all you more experienced lot for granted.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank you.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if Kelly remembers when I first came to this list but I was <br/>
very defensive of everything.  It was through reading, reading, reading and <br/>
more reading that I have come to the point I am in my life.  Her answers, <br/>
along with Ren, Deb, Rue,Pam, Joyce and others helped me question things I <br/>
really needed to question & change.<br/>
<br/>
I still read here everyday & find answers to questions I didnt&#39; even think I <br/>
had ;)   I don&#39;t know when I&#39;ll get to the &quot;perfect&quot; place but our family <br/>
has grown & changed thanks to the writings here & else where.<br/>
<br/>
I love the fact you all volunteer your time to help out & guide others on <br/>
their journey.  I often wonder how you all have time to answer the same <br/>
questions time after time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-105134585">Please don&#39;t do that.  I am humbled by your wisdom even though I am on the fence about &#39;unschooling&#39;.   Do not give these posts that kind of power.  I think you need to politely cut them loose sooner than later so that you remain true to your mission and service those seeking advise without some other kind of agenda.  You don&#39;t need to explain yourselves.   I think it is very obvious when a post has more issues than what&#39;s presented when people get defensive.  We all must take what we like, leave the rest and move on.  More often than not I read your responses and wonder why we all don&#39;t live this way.  It&#39;s all that baggage and conditioning we&#39;re carrying around that gets in the way.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1784676674">I want to say I am Thankful for this group. I came<br/>
here while in thearpy. One of my goals was to be a<br/>
mother who didn&#39;t hit her child. And I was searching<br/>
for a better way. Because hitting didn&#39;t work with me.<br/>
I&#39;d be more deffiant for it. Secondly it never worked<br/>
with my own son, because he&#39;d laugh and think it was a<br/>
game. Which only made me more mad. Plus, I&#39;d be<br/>
hurting (I&#39;m usually brought to tears from spanking).<br/>
I think it brings up a lot of memories I don&#39;t want to<br/>
remember. I need this group to continue my journey. I<br/>
understand if you want to  shut it down, though. I<br/>
just had to tell you how much you helped me to think,<br/>
and I know how easy that sounds, but I couldn&#39;t. I&#39;d<br/>
be caught up in the moment of anger, for whatever<br/>
really dumb reason, and I&#39;d lash out at my child.<br/>
Thank you. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This list has served as a wonderful touchstone for me!  I remember when I<br/>
first came here and started posing all my questions and concerns and how no<br/>
one would give me an answer but kept &quot;challenging&quot; me, I almost left.  But<br/>
then I started thinking of those questions the next time a situtation would<br/>
arise.  I would &quot;hear&quot; the voices of Deb, Ren, Kelly and Pam.  I could see<br/>
their words and it made me question myself and see things from a different<br/>
point of view.<br/>
<br/>
This is also my contact point for hearing all about what the Allen family is<br/>
up to since they moved away from here.  I can&#39;t wait to share the new<br/>
magazine article with the kids!  I would be saddened to see this list<br/>
disappear because of a few antagonistic people.<br/>

rules can be a problem. A principle can adjust to circumstances, ages, <br/>
stages, etc where rules have to be changed or broken (kind of like how <br/>
civil disobedience works - if a rule/law needs changing and those who <br/>
can change it won&#39;t then it gets broken until it does get <br/>
changed). &quot;be safe&quot; may be a 2 yr old holding hands in a parking lot; <br/>
for a 10 yr old, looking both ways TWICE and sticking to crosswalks <br/>
may be enough; and so on. <br/>

&gt; &gt; neighbors, strangers, etc. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   But when people want to attack the<br/>
&gt; list---THAT THEY JOINED <br/>
&gt; &gt; VOLUNTARILY---well, that just gets old. The<br/>
&gt; list IS what it is. Because <br/>
&gt; &gt; it *works* and because it&#39;s what we (Ren and<br/>
&gt; I) want it to be.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   Posts like yours (and Kristie&#39;s) make it<br/>
&gt; worth it. I *know* the list <br/>
&gt; &gt; is needed. I know because I was where you<br/>
&gt; (and others) are now at one <br/>
&gt; &gt; time. Several people gave and gave and gave<br/>
&gt; of themselves to help me <br/>
&gt; &gt; and Ren and Deb and Rue to the point we are<br/>
&gt; now: confident and <br/>
&gt; &gt; unwavering.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   Ren told me to chill out and let it<br/>
&gt; die---aGAIN! &lt;g&gt; She knows and *I* <br/>
&gt; &gt; know it happens regularly on a list that<br/>
&gt; makes people uncomfortable <br/>
&gt; &gt; with their previous and long-held beliefs.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s reallly not easy. <br/>
&gt; &gt; Simple, but not easy.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;  I&#39;m glad we&#39;re what you need. I hope to keep<br/>
&gt; it that way.<br/>

&gt; &gt;  I would just like to say something about<br/>
&gt; this group.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   I joined a very short while ago and think I<br/>
&gt; speak for many when I say <br/>
&gt; &gt; that I<br/>
&gt; &gt;   have found it IMMENSELY useful. It has<br/>
&gt; helped our family thrive, it <br/>
&gt; &gt; has<br/>
&gt; &gt;   assisted me to become a much more relaxed<br/>
&gt; mum, resulting in a big <br/>
&gt; &gt; shift in<br/>
&gt; &gt;  our family and a breakthrough today, with my<br/>
&gt; husband.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   Without this group I wouldnt have found<br/>
&gt; links to many websites that <br/>
&gt; &gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt;   given me advice and encouragement and<br/>
&gt; information when I have needed <br/>
&gt; &gt; it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   I havnt really posted much and probabally<br/>
&gt; wont, because I&#39;ve managed <br/>
&gt; &gt; to find<br/>
&gt; &gt;  alot of information for myself.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   I enjoy reading the posts and want to say<br/>
&gt; thank you to everyone for <br/>
&gt; &gt; offering<br/>
&gt; &gt;   your time. It was something I hadnt really<br/>
&gt; thought about before last <br/>
&gt; &gt; week<br/>
&gt; &gt;  and I kind of took all you more experienced<br/>
&gt; lot for granted.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1265248413">Kelly and Ren and all others who have worked so hard to help so many,<br/>
<br/>
I am Tyra of TN, who has been no mail for a while.  I got tanked up and had to step away to kind of find my own unschooling flow.  I have come back to get tanked up again and find it interesting that there is another thread about how people are feeling about how things are said in this group.  When I first joined I remembering questioning the very same thing although I find it hard to get offended especially when I have asked for advice.  However, this list is needed and I would truly be struggling if it were not for all the people in this group who have helped me and mine.  It has been reiterated time and time again through this thread that it is all voluntary.  I have come to learn that passion is a good thing especially when it comes to something that is life transforming for the better.  I guess my word for many of you would be passionate.  How can you really make something happen if there is no passion?  I don&#39;t think I would believe anything you all were saying if you were not passionate about unschooling and especially RU.  The other way that I describe you all is Child Advocates.  I have no problems with people who are advocating for a better life for children.  The world is a better place because of people like you.  I always think that my descendants may not know my name but they will have my love.  The love that I give to my children by choosing to live this lifestyle is eternal.  And it is this eternal love that will help more children be raised in the same way.<br/>
<br/>
I say all of this to make sure that I give back at least a little bit that I have been given from those of you from this group.  I say all of this to give back to you because I know that the giving is often too one sided.<br/>
<br/>
Again, thank you all.<br/>

&gt;   I was just talking to Ren about shutting down the list. It can be <br/>
&gt; exhausting answering the same questions---but that&#39;s not a problem, <br/>
&gt; really. We&#39;ve gotten pretty good at it and can almost do it in our <br/>
&gt; sleep---PLUS it solidifies unschooling to *us* when we put the same <br/>
&gt; thoughts into words over and over. That also makes it easier to <br/>
&gt; defend/explain when we have to deal with in-laws, extended family, <br/>

I won&#39;t be remembered for long, haven&#39;t done anything to get into the  <br/>
history books &lt;G&gt;, but I do know that my own kids will be wonderful  <br/>
parents to their children and, I think I&#39;ve helped some other parents  <br/>
enough that THEIR kids will be much better parents, too. That&#39;s a  <br/>
legacy that makes me very very happy.<br/>
<br/>
Each of us that breaks, or helps others break, a family pattern of  <br/>
harsh, punitive, or even abusive parenting, is passing a lot of our  <br/>

Wow. Thanks for the perspective, Tyra!!<br/>

   I want to say I am Thankful for this group. I came<br/>
here while in thearpy. One of my goals was to be a<br/>
mother who didn&#39;t hit her child. And I was searching<br/>
for a better way. Because hitting didn&#39;t work with me.<br/>
I&#39;d be more deffiant for it. Secondly it never worked<br/>
with my own son, because he&#39;d laugh and think it was a<br/>
game. Which only made me more mad. Plus, I&#39;d be<br/>
hurting (I&#39;m usually brought to tears from spanking).<br/>
I think it brings up a lot of memories I don&#39;t want to<br/>
remember. I need this group to continue my journey. I<br/>
understand if you want to  shut it down, though. I<br/>
just had to tell you how much you helped me to think,<br/>
and I know how easy that sounds, but I couldn&#39;t. I&#39;d<br/>
be caught up in the moment of anger, for whatever<br/>
really dumb reason, and I&#39;d lash out at my child.<br/>
Thank you.</div>

I don&#39;t post much here because it&#39;s just impossible to keep up with<br/>
replies to my posts in all the lists.  But I *do* read a lot.  Thanks<br/>
to so many people on the various RU lists.  It&#39;s absolutely wonderful.<br/>
 Interesting helpful useful info and ideas on how to free yourself up<br/>
for unschooling and how to free your children up for life.  Even if<br/>
you can&#39;t do unschooling in your own home, you can make a lot of<br/>
really lovely changes in how you parent.  That&#39;s worth so much.<br/>

Ditto from our entire family.  Unschooling is really working well for all of <br/>
us and I feel like a better mother and am a much happier person thanks in part <br/>
to all I&#39;ve learned here.  My children are remarkably happier and our world <br/>
is more peaceful and we are really enjoying each other.<br/>
