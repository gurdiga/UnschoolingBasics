<div id="ygrps-yiv-1605340245">Hi Jann,<br/>
<br/>
We had Sprint cell phone service, but dropped it after<br/>
we were paying for 750 minutes, and only used about<br/>
200.  We were paying over $90 a month for unused time,<br/>
but we were locked into a contract, and had to wait.<br/>
<br/>
We are using t-mobile to go.  I like it, it&#39;s much<br/>
more affordable, and you don&#39;t get charged for time<br/>
you aren&#39;t using.  We bought a phone from Costco, to<br/>
try it, and ended up buying another one, so that I and<br/>
my hubby can both use them.  We bought 1,000 minutes<br/>
for my phone, which is good for a year.  You only need<br/>
to buy more minutes when your time is getting low. <br/>
With the tracphone, you have to keep adding units,<br/>
whether you have used them all or not.  We&#39;ve done<br/>
alot of researching, and some of the pay as you go<br/>
phones, charge you minutes/units just to turn on the<br/>
phone--t-mobile doesn&#39;t.  I hope this helps.  I know<br/>
that Target sells the phones, with minutes included in<br/>
the package.  Good luck.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1077275182">Hi Jann, <br/>
<br/>
I wanted to tell you how we handled this issue, because it came up this <br/>
past month. <br/>
<br/>
My 11 year old daughter was talking about wanting to buy a cell phone <br/>
because her friend had just gotten the Firefly phone for her birthday <br/>
and she wanted one just like it. We looked into it, talked about it and <br/>
we came to the conclusion that they&#39;re rather expensive. <br/>
<br/>
Then, my husband said he would look into a pay-as-you-go phone and also <br/>
how much it would be to add her on our plan. Before he had a chance to <br/>
do that, I came up with an idea. <br/>
<br/>
I never use my cell phone on the weekends because my husband is usually <br/>
the only one that calls me, and he&#39;s home on Saturday & Sunday. So, I <br/>
thought to give her my phone on the weekends. It won&#39;t cost her <br/>
anything that way and it won&#39;t cost us any extra money either because <br/>
we have free weekends. She gets the phone on Friday night and she gives <br/>
it back to me Sunday, before she goes to bed. <br/>
<br/>
She bought herself the cutest phone case, added in her friends phone <br/>
numbers and she&#39;s all set. :-) <br/>
<br/>
What I think is really cute is the person she calls the MOST is me and <br/>
my mother. She calls me from the backyard all the time. LOL! My mother <br/>
lives next door but Shawna is always calling her to see if she needs <br/>
anything. :-) <br/>
Of course, she can use the phone during the week also but she likes <br/>
that it&#39;s ALL HER&#39;S on the weekend.  <br/>
<br/>
As far as the pay-as-you-go phones...my mom just bought a Virgin Mobile <br/>
and likes it. You buy minutes over the phone but that&#39;s all I know <br/>
about it. <br/>

Thanks Vanessa - my dad has a Tracphone and it&#39;s a pain to use.   He <br/>
only uses it when he travels a few times a year to visit friends in <br/>
case he needs it on the road.  I don&#39;t like that you have to keep <br/>

add more.   He never used all the minutes he had and I think I&#39;ll <br/>

will definitely check into that for both my dd and my dad.<br/>

rarely if ever have used all my minutes that I pay for and always have<br/>
roll over minutes each month.  We kept the same number of minutes<br/>
(lowest number for family sharing) but added her on to our &quot;family<br/>
plan&quot;  We really like Cingular as we have mobile-to-mobile free calls<br/>
(anyone on the Cingular network is free) and free nights and weekends.<br/>
 Fortunately her best friend also has Cingular and they can talk for<br/>
24 straight hours without using a single minute (and practically<br/>
have!)<br/>
<br/>
We did have a problem when she first got the phone about over use of<br/>
her text messages (she has 100 a month which come free with her plan)<br/>
and she went triple over that.  I showed her the bill and explained<br/>
how her texting cost us an additional $17.  No penalties.  Just<br/>
explained how much of a financial impact texting was when she could<br/>
just as easily call her friend instead.  This month was much better.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know why you feel you have to limit her phone use.  Do you<br/>
really think that it is going to be a problem?  What phone service do<br/>
her friends have?  Do you have a &quot;friends and family&quot; plan where you<br/>
can add people to a &quot;free call list&quot;?  I see limiting phone use not<br/>
much different from limiting food or tv or computer.  And at 14 I<br/>
don&#39;t see why she wouldn&#39;t be able to understand the financial impact<br/>
of over usage.  Before we got Emily a cell phone she was using mine<br/>
most of the time.  I would only use it if I was leaving the house in<br/>
case of emergencies or so the kids could contact me if I wasn&#39;t there.<br/>
 She would use it when she would go to the mall or other outings with<br/>
her friends or to the park with her siblings.  And she would use it to<br/>
call her best friend (who was land line long distance, but free with<br/>
the phone.)  Perhaps you could start that way and see just how much<br/>
she is using the phone.  Maybe a lot at first (new toy) but taper off<br/>
to a reasonable amount after a while.<br/>

<br/>
She has no friends that have cell phones.  I only mentioned limiting <br/>
the number of hours available because of her history of talking on <br/>
the phone at home for hours with her only IRL friend.  I&#39;m serious, <br/>
she only has ONE.  I don&#39;t have a problem with her talking at all, I <br/>
totally understand how important that is.   This friend doesn&#39;t have <br/>
a cell phone (she lives with her dad and finances are tight, they <br/>
don&#39;t have internet access or cable).  So there&#39;s really NO ONE she <br/>
would call other than this friend (or us).   I was thinking <br/>
initially if we did get her a phone it might be less expensive to <br/>
have a pay as you go plan because there isn&#39;t anyone for her to call <br/>
(except us or this friend, IF she happened to be home).   We have <br/>
Nextel (direct connect), dh uses it also at work.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s talked about having a cell phone and we also discussed the <br/>
reasons to get one.   IF she were out and about doing things, away <br/>
from home for periods of time without us, at school, at camp, <br/>
whatever the reason is, then I feel that&#39;s a good reason to have a <br/>
phone.  But for a child who is almost always home and has access to <br/>
the home phone (with free nationwide coverage) then I don&#39;t see the <br/>
need for a cell phone.  Also, if she were older and working and <br/>
wanted to pay for one, no problem.   <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s also considering going back to school next year (technical <br/>
high school, I&#39;ve posted about this before), I think she&#39;s really <br/>
feeling the isolation and would like to meet more teens.   Also, <br/>
this IRL friend is going there (only 2 months older but a freshman) <br/>
and she hears about her experiences with friends etc and I think <br/>
part of her would like to have those opportunities.  I told her if <br/>
she DID decide to go, then that would be a perfect reason to have <br/>
her own cell phone.<br/>
<br/>
The few times she&#39;s gone someplace without one of us, I give her my <br/>
cell phone and she&#39;s fine with that.<br/>

That&#39;s a great idea, I too, hardly use my phone (and probably should <br/>
use my free nights and weekend more, it&#39;s just so uncomfortable to <br/>
talk on the cell!) except when on the road and I need to contact dh <br/>
etc.   Although some weekends I&#39;m out (I&#39;m a musician and might be <br/>
at a rehearsal or gig and need to have the phone with me).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;She bought herself the cutest phone case, added in her friends <br/>

<br/>
That would be fine with me, except she only has one friend IRL (and <br/>
she doesn&#39;t have a cell phone.....if she&#39;s not at home where my dd <br/>
could possibly reach her, then she&#39;s out of the house with friends).<br/>
<br/>
I do give her mine if she goes someplace without one of us - she <br/>
says it&#39;s a good way for her to try out having one.   I told her to <br/>
call me anytime (if I&#39;m home, which I usually am, since I don&#39;t have <br/>
a cell phone!), which she has or her dad.   She&#39;s only started doing <br/>
this lately.<br/>

My husband calculated it out that if you buy the most minutes (which  <br/>
are cheapest and last the longest (200 minutes that last 3 months  <br/>
maybe?) -- they don&#39;t roll over) it costs about $100/year.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously if she&#39;s going to talk for more than 200 min over 3 months  <br/>
it will cost  more ;-)<br/>

I just talked to my husband, and asked him if t-mobile<br/>
minutes roll over, and he said they do, as long as you<br/>
purchase more minutes before the other ones expire. <br/>
So if you bought 90 minutes, and they are good for 3<br/>
months, as long as you buy more minutes before the 3<br/>
month time period is over, the minutes will roll over.<br/>
 All of this is information you can find on the<br/>
internet.  From all of our research, t-mobile was the<br/>
only one that we could find that don&#39;t charge you<br/>
minutes/units to turn on the phone, even before you<br/>
use it.  I don&#39;t know if this extra information helps<br/>
or not, but all I can tell you is research pay as you<br/>
go phones.  Everyone is going to have different<br/>
opinions.  It&#39;s best to try and figure out what works<br/>
best for you.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t know why you feel you have to limit her<br/>
&gt; phone use.  Do you<br/>
&gt; really think that it is going to be a problem?  What<br/>
&gt; phone service do<br/>
&gt; her friends have?  Do you have a &quot;friends and<br/>
&gt; family&quot; plan where you <br/>
&gt; can add people to a &quot;free call list&quot;?&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She has no friends that have cell phones.  I only<br/>
&gt; mentioned limiting <br/>
&gt; the number of hours available because of her history<br/>
&gt; of talking on <br/>
&gt; the phone at home for hours with her only IRL<br/>
&gt; friend.  I&#39;m serious, <br/>
&gt; she only has ONE.  I don&#39;t have a problem with her<br/>
&gt; talking at all, I <br/>
&gt; totally understand how important that is.   This<br/>
&gt; friend doesn&#39;t have <br/>
&gt; a cell phone (she lives with her dad and finances<br/>
&gt; are tight, they <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t have internet access or cable).  So there&#39;s<br/>
&gt; really NO ONE she <br/>
&gt; would call other than this friend (or us).   I was<br/>
&gt; thinking <br/>
&gt; initially if we did get her a phone it might be less<br/>
&gt; expensive to <br/>
&gt; have a pay as you go plan because there isn&#39;t anyone<br/>
&gt; for her to call <br/>
&gt; (except us or this friend, IF she happened to be<br/>
&gt; home).   We have <br/>
&gt; Nextel (direct connect), dh uses it also at work.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She&#39;s talked about having a cell phone and we also<br/>
&gt; discussed the <br/>
&gt; reasons to get one.   IF she were out and about<br/>
&gt; doing things, away <br/>
&gt; from home for periods of time without us, at school,<br/>
&gt; at camp, <br/>
&gt; whatever the reason is, then I feel that&#39;s a good<br/>
&gt; reason to have a <br/>
&gt; phone.  But for a child who is almost always home<br/>
&gt; and has access to <br/>
&gt; the home phone (with free nationwide coverage) then<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t see the <br/>
&gt; need for a cell phone.  Also, if she were older and<br/>
&gt; working and <br/>
&gt; wanted to pay for one, no problem.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She&#39;s also considering going back to school next<br/>
&gt; year (technical <br/>
&gt; high school, I&#39;ve posted about this before), I think<br/>
&gt; she&#39;s really <br/>
&gt; feeling the isolation and would like to meet more<br/>
&gt; teens.   Also, <br/>
&gt; this IRL friend is going there (only 2 months older<br/>
&gt; but a freshman) <br/>
&gt; and she hears about her experiences with friends etc<br/>
&gt; and I think <br/>
&gt; part of her would like to have those opportunities. <br/>
&gt; I told her if <br/>
&gt; she DID decide to go, then that would be a perfect<br/>
&gt; reason to have <br/>
&gt; her own cell phone.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The few times she&#39;s gone someplace without one of<br/>
&gt; us, I give her my <br/>
&gt; cell phone and she&#39;s fine with that.<br/>
