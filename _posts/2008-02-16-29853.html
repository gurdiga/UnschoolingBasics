<div id="ygrps-yiv-669743605">Yes...as I hope I made clear, she has very few restrictions on her.<br/>
Like, she is not allowed to slam her hard toys into the 55 gallon fish<br/>
tank.  But she is allowed and encouraged to eat when and what she<br/>
likes.  To enjoy her baths...to scream if she feels like it.  To dance<br/>
and sing as loud as she wants.  Climb on things and whatever else she<br/>
wants as long as it&#39;s not dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
I would like ideas on how to get the child I have now...to stop<br/>
chasing my cats and trying to grab my birds.  Can someone help me do<br/>
that?  I say No to her too much.  Redirection isn&#39;t working.  I want<br/>
an unschooling way to get her to stop touching the bird cage, and no I<br/>
can&#39;t move it my house is too small.  (I hope we will move soon, and<br/>
if not I&#39;m thinking about getting another cage that she can&#39;t touch.)<br/>
And I don&#39;t want to keep saying NO to her all the time.<br/>
<br/>
TIA,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1995977391">Cages that hang from the ceiling are too small and aren&#39;t good for the<br/>
birds.  Besides this house is so old I don&#39;t think it would support<br/>
the weight.  AND I&#39;m short so servicing the cage would be very hard.<br/>
Thanks for the idea but that&#39;s not going to work.  I&#39;m thinking I can<br/>
get a larger cage that is taller or put this one on a taller stand.<br/>
So that&#39;s one option I have...I just have to find something that is<br/>
taller.  Actually now that I look around I may have just the place!<br/>
Thanks for getting me thinking about different options =)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1379917801">The cats have baby gates up to keep her out of areas like the kitchen<br/>
so they have places to run to.  But I&#39;d like to see them again at some<br/>
point.  I guess it&#39;s just a matter of time and waiting for them to<br/>
stop running which is exciting to her or for her to decide they are<br/>
boring.  She and the dogs do fine.<br/>
<br/>
I think I can move the cage higher but top of the fridge isn&#39;t safe<br/>
for the birds.  I want them all to be happy and comfortable....kids<br/>
and pets.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-682674362">~~You don&#39;t wonder<br/>
when she cries from the depth of her soul what she is mourning.~~<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Really? You really believe that bio parents just KNOW this stuff? My<br/>
gawd, I WISH I knew these things, especially about Jalen. He was BORN<br/>
with issues. Yes, born with issues and challenges I can&#39;t possibly<br/>
understand.<br/>
He has had intensity (yes, from birth) that you can&#39;t explain with his<br/>
circumstances or environment. If only it were that simple.<br/>
<br/>
There is a lot of &quot;look, MY situation is different so these principles<br/>
and ideas won&#39;t work for me&quot; coming from your posts. Do you want ideas<br/>
for various situations or an excuse? There is nothing anyone can say<br/>
here if you&#39;ve already decided it can&#39;t work in your situation.<br/>
<br/>
But please, don&#39;t assume that the rest of us have some imaginary ideal<br/>
 life and children. Don&#39;t assume that even those of us with bio<br/>
children can&#39;t possibly understand abuse and adoption. I was raised in<br/>
a mixed family with three adopted kids that all came from abusive<br/>
backgrounds.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve got some challenges that will be difficult to navigate but if<br/>
you continue to see your child as someone that needs to be forced &quot;for<br/>
her own good&quot; it will block the view from the other side. There are<br/>
things that will be harder for you. There are issues you will deal<br/>
with that other people won&#39;t. But there is always more than two<br/>
options in any situation. At least explore some of those options with us. <br/>
<br/>
I would let a child run around naked before I got into a battle over a<br/>
diaper. I would find medicine they enjoyed taking over forcing<br/>
anything down their throat. &#39;Course in my case it would be unusual to<br/>
even get to the medicine stage as we use herbs and the &quot;wait and see&quot;<br/>
approach to most sickness. Even ears.<br/>

Get a nice BIG cage, and adapt it so it can hang from the ceiling.  Put <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m going to assume here that the problem is she either scares <br/>
and/or hurts the animals. If she&#39;s just wanting to feel them, then <br/>
find ways to let her do that safely. Show her how it&#39;s done gently. <br/>
Don&#39;t expect that she&#39;ll understand it and get it the first time you <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s NASTY to suggest your family is more important than the animals?<br/>
Sheesh.<br/>
You know, it&#39;s up to you to decide what is going to work out of the<br/>
suggestions, but when NOTHING we suggests can work, it&#39;s a personal<br/>
issues not about ideas. You have decided before asking for advice that<br/>
nothing will work. <br/>
<br/>
Do you want us to tell you how to keep your child away from the cage?<br/>
Spank her is what you&#39;ll get at many parenting sites. What the heck do<br/>
you want from this list??? Nobody knows your home or your life or what<br/>
will work or not but don&#39;t ask for advice if you&#39;re going to dismiss<br/>
it so readily. You don&#39;t need advice, you already know the answers.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I hear what you&#39;re saying!  When my now-13-year-old son, Liam, was <br/>
really little he could be pretty aggressive with our old kitty.  He <br/>
had no malice whatsoever, but the principle of everyone, including <br/>
our wonderful cat, being safe in the house was my biggest concern for <br/>
me.  I felt it was not fair to the cat not to ensure his safety to <br/>
the best of my ability.<br/>
<br/>
What I did was redirect Liam; rather than saying no, I&#39;d find <br/>
something else that was at least as fun if not more fun to do.  That <br/>
could mean getting out of the house for a few minutes or for a longer <br/>
time.  Just something to change things up a bit.  I also made sure <br/>
the cat had a safe place to be.  And, I helped Liam find ways to love <br/>
the cat that weren&#39;t so scary for the cat.  I modeled better, more <br/>
gentle ways of interacting with the cat.<br/>
<br/>
After that cat passed on and we got a couple of younger cats, the <br/>
cats&#39; safety was still a concern.  I did talk to Liam about my <br/>
concerns (he was probably 6 or 7 years old at the time), not in a <br/>
punishing or shaming way. We talked about their safety and his safety <br/>
and my safety, and I asked him what he thought we should do about <br/>
making sure the cats are safe in their own home.  He agreed that <br/>
everyone should be safe in the house, and he became much, much more <br/>
respectful of the cats&#39; autonomy.  Now, he is quite an advocate for the cats.<br/>
<br/>
I should point out that I did consider finding another home for the <br/>
cats, even temporarily, as unthinkable to me as that was.  I felt <br/>
that I needed to provide them with a safe home, and I had to be <br/>
honest with myself about whether or not I could do that.  I&#39;m glad it <br/>
never came to that, but it was on the table.<br/>
<br/>
It was a process, to be sure, and I would never leave him alone with <br/>
the cat when he was little.  I would never leave him alone ~ period ~ <br/>
when he was little (I&#39;m not assuming you do that, though; I&#39;m just <br/>
telling you what *I* did).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-608552875">The problem isn&#39;t that all ideas have to work, it&#39;s that you don&#39;t seem to see that people are suggesting thinking of something else. Nobody actually, really cares how you deal with the bird and your daughter. What they want to do is help you to see a new way to deal with the bird and your daughter, even if it isn&#39;t any way that has been suggested. If what works is giving the bird to someone who doesn&#39;t have a 3 year old chasing the bird around and freaking it out, than that is what works. If what works is drilling a hole in a beam and hanging a cage from the ceiling than that is what works. If you found a solution that wasn&#39;t suggested, more power to you. But you don&#39;t have to attack everyone for not knowing that you have an asbestos riddled house or for making suggestions that don&#39;t work. Just let those ones go, if you want to comment, say thank you, but it isn&#39;t really kind to attack people when they are spending their time helping you. Really. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-561082971">Hi Karen<br/>
<br/>
Somehow the original posts from Yahoo come in much later than the first responses and this is one of the times where I am glad for a replier not deleting the oriiginal post. :)<br/>
<br/>
Dearest, you are really into a complex situation with your little one. The cats and bird cages are just a &#39;symptom&#39; of what it is all about, I guess. You really took on a BIG task with adopting this little one and you are also aware that there are more issues to be handled than you originally thought that there could be. I take off my hat for you and your courage.<br/>
<br/>
Cats, birds, roads, toys, people, going in the car, eating, sleeping, changing clothes (Diapers), bathing and so on each pose a new set of conditions that you have certain expectations about and the little one has no clue what it is all about.<br/>
<br/>
You know waht, I wold just try to find a balance with one issue and only then look for finding a solution for the next and leave the rest out. Cats can look after themselves. Bird cages, if they are sturdy enough should be able to protect the inhabitants in a way, Food is really a &#39;no matter issue&#39; in the long run, diapers - how about letting them go and give her a no diaper, no pants time to get to enjoy her body (including some mud baths - sorry, you are still in winter time, no outside revelling in a mud pit yet. :) (Ariëlla arrived here today a mess after she had found a spot with REAL mud in and splashed it all over herself. Rain in Namibia gives the most amazing experiences for little ones! :)))  But maybe something similar. a big enough bowl to sit in and play with water and toys and splashing and getting cleaned up at the same time. A poo-mess on the floor is cleaned up so easily, too. And a potty can be kept around, too.<br/>
<br/>
Ariëlla is a year old now. She started walking, too and can get wherever she wants to, also to the cat food bowls, which she loves taking apart and the cats who are to lethargic to move out of the way in time. Georg gives her a slap - Little baby big cry :) and Benny endures her pulling of parts of his fur with an unconditional patience.  She is learning. She is already keeping a healthy distance to Georg and shows still a lot of interest in exploring the mess around abilities with the other five cats of which some have the healthy self serving habit of staying out of her way.<br/>
<br/>
OK, Ariëlla loves one of my bookcases. She just loves to pull the books out and starts nibbling on at least one of them. So I dedicated an obsolote book to her and keep that one around. When she gets near the book case I hand her her &#39;own&#39; book to do with as she desires and return the other books to their place, sometimes telling her that those are MY books. <br/>
<br/>
How about having LOTS of Morgan things around to give her for exploring and enjoying when she starts exploring the exciting new place she lives in now? Stuffed birds, (You get them in talking versions, too :), lots of stuffed animals (they are so cheap from the Chinese shops) magazines to take apart, books you hate (I have a few that I can&#39;t burn but they are good enough for the baby :) and so on.<br/>
<br/>
As I understand this unschoolong life style it is not really about being a good mother or parent but about finding ways to respect the current needs of our children and helping them to fulfil those. For your little one I guess a BIG need is to make sense of her new environment. TALK to her all the time and tell her ALL about what she is experiencing. Even if she is non verbalizing she picks up the vibes of information and communication and Connection and love and acceptance and LOVE and acknowledgement and hope and trust that you provide all the time, which you do from the previous posts I read about your adventure. And even if I am not a proponent of &#39;fixing&#39; any situation I would suggest that you learn EFT (emofree.com) and apply it in all those &#39;dire straights&#39; situations that come up each day. For your own sake and for her blessed future.<br/>
<br/>
OK Karen I deleted my next words because I felt that you would take umbrage again.<br/>
 I wrote &quot;Stop blaming the circumstances for all the things that don&#39;t work.&quot; Like the house and the mold and the finances or whatever. What is is. What you make of it is what you experience. You are the sole conductor of your experience. You can hate it or make peace with it. Hating it (or fighting or complaining about it) takes up so much of your valuable life energy. Is it really worth it? Isn&#39;t finding and designing workable solutions much more fun?<br/>

Ah, the only blaming I did was to the specific solution of hanging the<br/>
cage, and when I was told I was being difficult.  Life is what it is.<br/>
Perhaps other members of this list have the ability to design their<br/>
lives as they wish and can live anywhere or would even toss the<br/>
animals out because they see pets as disposable toys.  I had already<br/>
posted that I had a new look around my house and it&#39;s going to take a<br/>
lot of shuffling of furniture but I can move the cage to a better spot<br/>
for her and them.  But it will work out just fine...and I don&#39;t have<br/>
to drill supports or inhale asbestos to do it.  I thank you for your<br/>
help and your lovely post.  The diaper issue has also been solved but<br/>
once it warms up she will be spending a lot of time at the beach =)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-914656139">Yep yep.  And I think that&#39;s just where it&#39;s going to stay really.<br/>
Redirecting over and over until the cats figure out to stop running.<br/>
She&#39;s not really dangerous to them....now the birds are very small and<br/>
she has to be really watched with them.  I do show her how to be<br/>
gentle with them, well one is handlable, the other bites everyone so<br/>
really it&#39;s just the one.  And when she wants to pet the bird she will<br/>
grab my hand and put it on hers to have me help her pet the bird.  But<br/>
I want her away from the cage because she touches the bottom and<br/>
although I keep it clean, I&#39;m worried about her ingesting nasties from<br/>
the cage you know?  Tomorrow I&#39;m going to play furniture checkers to<br/>
get the cage moved and I think it will fix the problem completely.<br/>
<br/>
The cats are able to escape over the baby gates so they aren&#39;t in any<br/>
real danger but it would be nice to see them once in a while you know?<br/>
 I also never leave her alone if she&#39;s awake.  When she&#39;s napping I<br/>
escape to a quick shower or put laundry away etc...otherwise I&#39;m with<br/>
her the whole time.<br/>

Force.  You don&#39;t have to sign any contract, and you can move off the <br/>
base whenever you like.  You have a choice.  You made the choice to <br/>
adopt an abused child.  You have other children and several pets, and <br/>
you&#39;re all &quot;crammed&quot; into a small, horrible house, yet you still made <br/>
that choice.  So why complain so much about all your unique <br/>
circumstances and lack of money to buy toys and so many other things?  <br/>
You chose to get the pets and adopt the child.<br/>
<br/>
And I seriously doubt that you can do nothing about government housing <br/>
that has asbestos problems.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2123385965">When we lived on base in Hawaii, there was one family that had birds <br/>
outside in cages in the carport. A friend of mine who got cats but <br/>
couldn&#39;t have them in the house (on base, again) because everyone <br/>
was allergic, built an outdoor enclosure in the carport for the <br/>
cats. <br/>

<br/>
Pets aren&#39;t disposable but they aren&#39;t more important than children. <br/>
I had to get rid of my dog when my dh deployed and I was left to <br/>
care for a teenager and a 3 year old while I was pregnant. I just <br/>
didn&#39;t have anything left for the dog and he was suffering because <br/>
of it. Giving him to another family was the best thing I could do <br/>
for him. I still had my cat at that point. However, after having my <br/>
baby, while my dh still had been deployed for 6 months and still had <br/>
another 6 months to go, and the cat still had an ear infection that <br/>
I couldn&#39;t treat properly because I didn&#39;t have the time or energy <br/>
or even memory to give her meds on time, I gave the cat to my mom. <br/>

That&#39;s a great list of things but to limit them to &quot;math&quot;, to me,  <br/>
limits the experience and then the fluidity and joy of it. Who knows  <br/>
whether an encounter w/ geologic time will translate to &quot;learning  <br/>

enactment of love eternal.  Really who knows.  We never do and when  <br/>
we don&#39;t, we get to discover along the way too.<br/>
