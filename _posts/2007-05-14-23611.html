                      2007 Highlights: SCHOOLED!<br/>
    Rethinking Education has negotiated a premiere viewing of this just released film!<br/>
<br/>
   Schooled: The Movie<br/>
  Released in April 2007, Rethinking Education has received the enthusiastic endorsement of director and producer Brooks Elms, who has agreed to this premiere private showing of &quot;Schooled&quot;. Says Brooks. &quot;Rethinking Education is the perfect audience for my film about the horror that is public school and the beauty of freedom and child-led learning.&quot;<br/>
  SCHOOLED is an earthy character study about a teacher in crisis who&#39;s burned out from teaching high school. He leaves his job and his wife to take time off and he discovers a shockingly different type of school. It&#39;s democratically run so even the youngest students have equal power. That means: no tests, no grades, and no homework. If a kid wants to play video games all day, that choice is totally supported. Fred knows this is ridiculous and that it&#39;s really just an excuse for teachers to be as lazy as the kids. Yet the more he hangs around the place, the more his fundamental concepts about authority figures get challenged. By the time he leaves, he still thinks the place is nuts, although it&#39;s given him the insight to face the even deeper crisis that spawned the journey in the first place: should he become a father?<br/>
  In an upcoming newsletter we will feature an interview with producer and director Brooks Elms... stay tuned!<br/>
<br/>
                    JOIN US!<br/>
  <br/>
   Join hundreds of unschooling families from around the globe as we rethink the meanings of education, learning and parenting. Rethinking Education supports attachment parenting, unconditional love, support for each person&#39;s unique journey of life experience, freedom with responsibility, unschooling and you. YOU are the vital ingredient at this conference, as we come together and revel in the magic and mystery of kindred spirits and each other&#39;s rich diversity, as we challenge ourselves to trust the extraordinary process of living and learning, the wondrous ability to improve the ways we communicate, discovering new ways of listening to one another, giving full support to our dreams, no matter how wild or ordinary, large or small.<br/>
  Unschooling is vital to the profoundly intelligent development of our children. And yes, as adults we can even unschool ourselves... as you will discover.<br/>
<br/>
                    <br/>
   Let us put our minds together and see what we will make for our children.<br/>

                    MORE 2007 Highlights: Maria Whitworth<br/>
    Maria joins us with more than 24 years of unschooling experience and inspiration<br/>
<br/>
   is a creative collaborator with her 3 unschooled adult daughters (ages 25, 22, and 21). A professional graphic designer, publicity/marketing consultant and writer, she tries to live by one rule: &quot;If it&#39;s not fun, don&#39;t do it!&quot; Maria continues to regress into a revised version of her childhood, and hopes to lose all seriousness by the time she reaches 60.<br/>
  Maria will host:<br/>
  Our Children, Ourselves: Unschoolers (and our relationships) Grow Up<br/>
  If you have young unschooling children, it may be hard to imagine them &quot;grown up&quot; and living in the World. Of course, it will happen - and if you wonder how unschooling them today leads to who they are tomorrow, get this peek at the future!<br/>
  Yes, unschoolers not only manage to become adults, but our relationship as parents also matures into something unique in this culture ñ and that is a deep friendship with our adult children that includes wisdom-sharing as equal beings.<br/>
  This session will reveal some of the possible long-term effects that your unschooling actions today can have on your children as they evolve into social, political, sexual and emotional participants in &quot;real life.&quot; What you learn might amaze you!<br/>
