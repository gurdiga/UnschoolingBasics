<div id="ygrps-yiv-1974358512">I am trying to work something out in  my head and am wondering if <br/>
other parents have dealt with this.  One of the biggest reasons i <br/>
finally made the leap to take Liz (15) out of school was her high <br/>
level of anxiety.  Things got bad enough that I asked her doctor for <br/>
medication because the school basically threatened me with <br/>
prosecuting us for truancy and letting the judge deal with me.   The <br/>
first medication worked for the short term but after a few weeks her <br/>
body got used to it and she went back to feeling anxious.  At that <br/>
point she became completely unable to cope because once she knew <br/>
what &quot;normal&quot; felt like she felt even worse.  They changed the type <br/>
of medication to an anti depressant for a better long term effect <br/>
but that took two weeks to kick in.  This is when I took her out of <br/>
school.  For some reason at teh time it made sense to me to wait <br/>
until after break but because of the med issue we stopped early.  <br/>
<br/>
Now it is a year and a half later and she has made amazing strides <br/>
dealing with her anxiety.  By taking one medication every day and <br/>
having another for high stress times (mostly sleeping away fom home) <br/>
she has done awesome.  Two years ago she couldn&#39;t sleep away from <br/>
home without hyperventilating and throwing up so she had stopped <br/>
trying.   This weekend she was invited to go to North Carolina and <br/>
Busch Gardens with a friend on Sunday so she put a bag together and <br/>
left on Monday.  Amazing!  She hasn&#39;t even had to take the special <br/>
medicine in about a year.  I think just having it is enough to keep <br/>
her anxiety down.<br/>
<br/>
So my problem is she has decided not to take the anti depressant <br/>
anymore either and is currently difficult to live with.  She is <br/>
quicker than usual to blow up and very defensive.  She is also not <br/>
talking to me as much as usual but that is more likely because she <br/>
always has friends over now that school is out.  I&#39;ve come to the <br/>
place that I am trusting her to make this decision and I let her <br/>
know that but also asked her to be aware of finding new ways to <br/>
control her emotions.  The way she sees it is that she doesn&#39;t have <br/>
problem with anyone else but me so it is my problem.  The other <br/>
people we live with (my mom and step son) are also having problems <br/>
with her and struggling to be patient.  I see them not wanting to <br/>
spend time with her and this worries me.  I am worried that we will <br/>
return to old patterns.  I am working hard to support her and <br/>
respect her right to control her body but worry about what the <br/>
consequences might be.  I also miss us liking each other cause right <br/>
now we just don&#39;t a good bit of the time.  Any feedback would be <br/>
helpful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2012289990">How long has she been off the anti-depressant?  Did she wean off, or<br/>
just stop &quot;cold-turkey&quot;?  Many anti-depressants have some nasty<br/>
withdrawals associated with them, and it sounds to me that the short<br/>
fuse may likely be withdrawal symptom; it can take time for her body<br/>
to get used to not having the drug anymore.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you can look into some aromatherapy or diet change to help her<br/>
cope with the withdrawal, and make it a little less difficult.  (I<br/>
don&#39;t know, just a guess. . . .)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-324191063">I&#39;ve heard that Omega 3 fatty acids are being explored as a treatment  <br/>
for depression. Apparently, some depression at least, can be traced to  <br/>
dietary deficiencies. You might want to check your local library for  <br/>
The omega-3 connection : the groundbreaking omega-3 antidepression  <br/>
diet and brain program by Andrew L. Stoll c2001. Also, some public  <br/>
libraries provide access to specialize subscription databases that may  <br/>
have relevant articles not easily found on the free web.  Not an easy  <br/>
situation.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-675058806">I was thinking it may just be temporary withdrawal.  I think she did <br/>
just stop taking it.  In the past she would go through periods when she <br/>
would forget to take it.  She asked me to help her by packaging it for <br/>
her every week.  She did take that with her this week on her road <br/>
trip.  It may be that she didn&#39;t decide not to take it but just didn&#39;t <br/>
remember and then got agitated and defensive about it.  I&#39;ll try <br/>
talking to her about it when she gets home.   <br/>
<br/>
I like the idea about offering armoatherapy or diet options to her but <br/>
I don&#39;t know anything about what they would be.<br/>
