Teeth brushing is not as healthy as it is made out to be.<br/>
<br/>
I have read horror stories about some of the effects the stuff that is put into toothpastes can have on teeth, gums and the body.<br/>
<br/>
To eat an apple or carrot or piece of fullcorn bread cleanses the teeth good enough.<br/>
<br/>
When my eldest son had to go to a dentist for a medical checkup for some certificate or other at the age of 28 or so he bought his first toothbrush and -paste ever. At the visit the dentist was amazed at the good conition of his teeth and gums and asked him what he was doing. Alfred said, &quot;Do you want the nice answer or the true answer?&quot;  When the dentist heard that he never uses brush and paste he felt very validated in his own personal and professional aversion to the stuff :) I can&#39;t remember all the thigs Alfred related that the dentist had told him but it was said quite forcefully.<br/>
<br/>
The health of teeth does not depend on what is done from the outside but on the nutrition. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-291351220">I have a child in the exact situation.... I made sure to provide lots<br/>
of implements ... interesting power brushes, milder toothpaste (or<br/>
even no toothpaste!)  and just modeled good dental hygiene.    Making<br/>
it a battle isn&#39;t going to accomplish much other than proving to him<br/>
that you don&#39;t trust him and that he can&#39;t trust you.  Forcing a child<br/>
who has what sounds like sensory issues and has a history of dental<br/>
issues is really setting him up for difficulty.   My son has gotten<br/>
better about brushing now that he&#39;s noticed that sometimes people have<br/>
bad breath... he&#39;s 6 now and will  say &quot;wow mom you need to brush&quot;  I<br/>
always say &quot;yes I had garlic for dinner &quot;  hoping that he will connect<br/>
that some foods make your breath stinkier and that some things like<br/>
poppy seeds, strawberries, blueberries etc make your teeth look icky<br/>
if you don&#39;t brush.  Ultimately I leave it up to him ....I can fix his<br/>
teeth but his spirit might be trickier!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-327714423">But that is a lie, and a scary lie at that.. The bacteria in your mouth don&#39;t destroy your teeth, it&#39;s the acids the bacteria produce that destry the enamel on your teeth. I wasn&#39;t a good brusher and didn&#39;t have any tooth decay until I was an adult, so brushing my teeth didn&#39;t seem to be necessary to guard my teeth from caries. Yes there are bugs on your teeth, but they aren&#39;t there digging into your teeth until a child screams. That&#39;s just so malicious and evil. They are just making a living eating the food that you eat. And no matter how hard you brush you won&#39;t get rid of all of them.  <br/>
<br/>
It is interesting, I&#39;ve just been doing a quick and cursory exploration of the world of oral bacteria via google and found this: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.db.od.mah.se/car/data/kohlermut.html">http://www.db.od.mah.se/car/data/kohlermut.html</a> which shows that the earlier you get mutans streptococci the more prone to caries/cavities you are, with absolutely no discussion of how much you brush or floss your teeth. Here&#39;s an abstract about the natural history of  Streptoccus sanguinis (a benign oral bacteria) <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://iai.asm.org/cgi/content/abstract/68/7/4018">http://iai.asm.org/cgi/content/abstract/68/7/4018</a> I think I like it most because it refers to oral bacteria as &quot;indigenous biota of the human oral cavity&quot;. Oh, how I love science!! There is this talk abstract: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://iadr.confex.com/iadr/2002SanDiego/techprogram/abstract_18332.htm">http://iadr.confex.com/iadr/2002SanDiego/techprogram/abstract_18332.htm</a> which found no difference in colonization of mutans streptococci in caries free Swedish teenagers and caries prevelant Swedish teenagers. Similar finding here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://jdr.iadrjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/77/10/1851">http://jdr.iadrjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/77/10/1851</a> with the added<br/>
 comment that it isn&#39;t diet that is doing it. Oh, I could do this for a long time. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really cool. It isn&#39;t scary, or something to be used to scare a child with, they are cavities, holes in your teeth caused by acids. The bacteria, the indigenous biota, are just living there, they are indigenous. Well, they are indigenous from about 30 months old, on average. Yes, toothbrushing makes a difference <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Aktion=ShowAbstract&ArtikelNr=16503&Ausgabe=225458&ProduktNr=224219">http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Aktion=ShowAbstract&ArtikelNr=16503&Ausgabe=225458&ProduktNr=224219</a> (an old paper, 1999, but cool for the British social class stuff -- I&#39;m assuming that&#39;s what the manual versus non-manual mention is about).  A big difference. But it isn&#39;t going to keep you clear of caries if you are prone to getting them. Hard cheese is supposed to be quite good for regulating the population of mutans streptococci, quick search shows that lactobacilli tends to keep populations of mutans streptococci in check. Xylitol has been shown to reduce plaque and when mother&#39;s chew it for the first couple of years of<br/>
 their child&#39;s life the colonization of the child&#39;s teeth by mutans streptococci is delayed and thus caries are less likely to occur. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want monsters in my mouth, it would scare me. I&#39;d much rather indigenious biota sharing my body with me, I can enjoy that, while doing a bit of culling to keep the population for getting out of hand.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1707142418">That&#39;s interesting, but what do you do when they have a cavity at the  <br/>
dentist and it doesn&#39;t hurt? You&#39;ve blown credibility and they  <br/>
question everything else you&#39;ve told them. My oldest children each  <br/>
had one cavity, regardless of brushing or flossing tactics. I brush  <br/>
and floss three times a day, don&#39;t drink a lot of sugary stuff, and  <br/>
not only have 12 fillings, but nearly every year have to have at  <br/>
least one filling drilled out and replaced. My six yo is the same  <br/>
way...and he has the exact same hygiene habits as the older four  <br/>
kids. We&#39;ve never had a cavity that hurts.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-29259845">This is lying to your child, period.  The information you suggest is simply not true.  I have floosed and brushed every day for my entire 41 year old life, and yet every trip to the dentist shows up yet another cavity or some other form of decay.  It&#39;s just the way I&#39;m built.  My husband on the other hand never flosses, never brushes at night and has never had a cavity.  Would you want someone to motivate you to do something they thought was good for you by scaring the crap out of you??  Not very respectful or loving in my opinion!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-450519673">Re: teeth brushing...if your child has weak enamel over-brushing can<br/>
CAUSE cavitites as well.  I have strong enamel and take horrid care of<br/>
my teeth.  I just turned 37 and have no cavities.  Both my parents<br/>
have full dentures and both brothers have mouthes full of fillings.<br/>
But I can&#39;t for the life of me see telling a child that the &quot;bugs&quot;<br/>
will bore through the teeth until the child screams in pain will bring<br/>
you closer or make the child think you are nice.  FWIW I&#39;d leave the<br/>
kid alone.  Tell the kid about brushing, why we do it and then leave<br/>
it be.  My kids are not forced to brush their teeth.  But they have<br/>
several flavors of toothpaste, different brushes, and gauze pads to<br/>
use instead of brushes if they wish.  It&#39;s their mouth...I leave them<br/>
alone about it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1088963359">-wow, never thought I&#39;d get these reactions from parents. normally <br/>
with kids, when I say it, it didn&#39;t cause fear. just understanding <br/>
ONE cause of the effect they are presently experiencing. since the <br/>
child is only four & already have lots of work done or to be done, it <br/>
is already at the consequences level. sugarbugs are just kids term <br/>
easy for them to get, but if they like the scientific terms, that&#39;s <br/>
even great. I thought it&#39;s fun to clean your teeth when there&#39;s the <br/>
visual of colors, it&#39;s like washing off paint. you can also show <br/>
pictures of the tooth structure, when its just the enamel part, it <br/>
doesn&#39;t hurt yet, but when it goes deeper then you&#39;d feel it. then <br/>
kids are somehow become self motivated. I thought, it&#39;s loving to <br/>
encourage  children to care for their teeth for some prevention than <br/>
just let them experience the dental work needed.  sorry, I, myself <br/>
still shed a tear or two when I&#39;m on a dental chair, so it&#39;s hard for <br/>
me to see kids screaming during drill time. I believe genes, <br/>
nutrition, injury & hygiene determines teeth conditions. If you got <br/>
good genes, happy you. If you don&#39;t, it&#39;s nice to care about the 3 <br/>
other ones. I didn&#39;t say, you have to force or scare. you explain it <br/>
in a fun way, you can even sing while the child is brushing. when a <br/>
child have colds or cough, you don&#39;t say that they&#39;re monsters in <br/>
their nose or hands, they&#39;re just germs that needs to be washed away <br/>
or get rid off, & careful not to spread it around.<br/>
<br/>
Plus, a mom told me, she went to a community dental clinic for her <br/>
son&#39;s dental work. She was told that they will eventually report her <br/>
to CPS for neglect, if the lack of hygiene continues. I thought, it <br/>
was absurd, but that happened to her.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;a scary lie, malicious & evil!&quot; Oh, my goodness! That just makes me <br/>
feel so welcome in this group! I thought, with suggestions, if <br/>
someone finds it good or helpful...then great. If not, oh well...next.<br/>
my first reaction was, &quot;WOW!&quot; I guess, that&#39;ll also be my last.<br/>

at that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Could you show me where it says &quot;malicious and evil&quot;? I don&#39;t see that<br/>
anywhere. I don&#39;t know what else an untruth could be called but a &quot;lie&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe that sounds harsh, but it happens so often that children get<br/>
exaggerated and  lied to in order to manipulate them into some<br/>
desirable  behavior. We try to encourage honesty and trust, rather<br/>
than overreactionary information that they might figure out isn&#39;t true. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is hugely about exploring options and information, rather<br/>
than giving children one stilted bit of information to get a desired<br/>
behavior.<br/>
<br/>
I personally have family members that rarely ever brush and have<br/>
perfect teeth. So the &quot;pain&quot; of dental work has never happened to them<br/>
in spite of not doing the customary prevention. <br/>

  I&#39;m assuming you came here to learn about unschooling...I think I remember you telling us you are new to unschooling?  I&#39;ve been around for only about 10 months, so I consider myself a newbie too.  On the description and suggestions on the yahoo group when you signed up, it is suggested to read for a few weeks or more to find out the tone of the group, find out more, and definitely wait awhile before offering suggestions.  To protect the integrity of the group and unschooling principles, there are those here that will take umbrage to any talk that doesn&#39;t fully embrace trusting our kids, and not parenting by fear, punishment, bribery, or scare tactics.  So I would encourage you to read, read, read, because there really is tons of wisdom and insight on this list.  I for one have learned TONS.  And it&#39;s not personal, that&#39;s what took a month or so for me to get.  I would read a response and think, wow, that&#39;s harsh, and I learned that the responses come from those who have<br/>
 been unschooling for a long time sharing their wisdom and experience.  I hope you stick around to get the wisdom!<br/>

&gt; -wow, never thought I&#39;d get these reactions from parents. normally<br/>

&gt; ONE cause of the effect they are presently experiencing. since the<br/>
&gt; child is only four & already have lots of work done or to be done, it<br/>
&gt; is already at the consequences level. sugarbugs are just kids term<br/>
&gt; easy for them to get, but if they like the scientific terms, that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; even great. I thought it&#39;s fun to clean your teeth when there&#39;s the<br/>
&gt; visual of colors, it&#39;s like washing off paint. you can also show<br/>
&gt; pictures of the tooth structure, when its just the enamel part, it<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t hurt yet, but when it goes deeper then you&#39;d feel it. then<br/>
&gt; kids are somehow become self motivated. I thought, it&#39;s loving to<br/>
&gt; encourage children to care for their teeth for some prevention than<br/>
&gt; just let them experience the dental work needed. sorry, I, myself<br/>
&gt; still shed a tear or two when I&#39;m on a dental chair, so it&#39;s hard for<br/>
&gt; me to see kids screaming during drill time. I believe genes,<br/>
&gt; nutrition, injury & hygiene determines teeth conditions. If you got<br/>
&gt; good genes, happy you. If you don&#39;t, it&#39;s nice to care about the 3<br/>
&gt; other ones. I didn&#39;t say, you have to force or scare. you explain it<br/>
&gt; in a fun way, you can even sing while the child is brushing. when a<br/>
&gt; child have colds or cough, you don&#39;t say that they&#39;re monsters in<br/>
&gt; their nose or hands, they&#39;re just germs that needs to be washed away<br/>
&gt; or get rid off, & careful not to spread it around.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Plus, a mom told me, she went to a community dental clinic for her<br/>
&gt; son&#39;s dental work. She was told that they will eventually report her<br/>
&gt; to CPS for neglect, if the lack of hygiene continues. I thought, it<br/>
&gt; was absurd, but that happened to her.<br/>

I have a mouth full of fillings. And a crown. Ben has none, but he <br/>
suffers from receding gums (and has two surgeries to help mend them). <br/>
We&#39;re hoping (and so far it IS) that the boys get Bens&#39; strong teeth <br/>
and my strong gums. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I had a sadistic dentist (Dr Bauknight) as a child until, at 12, I <br/>
refused to ever go back to the mean SoB. My mother had to search all <br/>
over town for a nice one &#39;cause I would never have gone back to that <br/>
dentist. I worshipped Dr Ridenour until he died 14 years ago. What a <br/>
BLOW!<br/>
<br/>
Neither of my boys have ever had a cavity. Our new dentist of 13 years, <br/>
Dr Duensing (his partner is---no joke: Dr John Holt! &lt;g&gt;), is <br/>
INCREDIBLY kind and gentle, and the boys have no issues going. It&#39;s a <br/>
very pleasant experience every time.<br/>

I swear some dentists are right out of Little Shop of Horrors! I can&#39;t <br/>
believe how many folks still have sadistic dentists. There are GOOD <br/>
ones out there! Go find one!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-93061636">When my son Zack decided to stop brushing years ago, I wasn&#39;t happy about<br/>
it.  I have bad teeth, and his dad&#39;s aren&#39;t much better.  In fact, Zack had<br/>

It turned out that he just didn&#39;t like the toothpaste.  He had switched from<br/>
a fruit flavored kid toothpaste to a minty adult paste.  He discovered that<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1503966469">Isn&#39;t it funny when a really big deal turns out to be about something so simple?!?  I laughed when I read this, because a few weeks ago Jade (one of my 3 1/2 year old twin girls) told me she didn&#39;t ever want to brush because the toothpaste is &#39;howibwe&#39;...it was kids minty something or other.  After she told me that we went out and found Tom&#39;s apricot flavour (tastes like jam) and she&#39;s been brushing non-stop ever since.  Oh, and they also got to pick out a fancy motorized Dora toothbrush which delights them to no end :).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-326655894">I would just like to vent a little about being out today with two other unschooling families.  I am SO craving spending some time with some radical unschoolers!!!  I have met lots of people who keep their kids out of school, put it that way.

It&#39;s like they still think that if they totally trusted their kids that total and permanent chaos would ensue.  Isn&#39;t that the fear at the beginning??  But some of these moms have been &#39;unschooling&#39; for almost 10 years!  They were so suprised today when we were all offered cake - that my girls said they weren&#39;t hungry.  They were all like, &#39;wow&#39;.  Perhaps they&#39;re more used to their kids filling their faces with cake when they get the<br/>
 chance.  Then one of the moms told me how she made her son say thank you to a complete stranger, and how he looked uncomfortable, but that she didn&#39;t want other people thinking her kids are rude because they&#39;re homeschooled so she forces them to be polite...argh!!!  I have made the effort to meet SO many unschoolers here, and each one has a limit on SOMETHING, whether it&#39;s sugar, tv, bedtime, you name it, I haven&#39;t met one singe FREE child that is completely trusted.  And then my very schooled brain gears up and says, but maybe they&#39;re right to be setting limits, blah blah blah, even though I KNOW in my heart of hearts that giving my girls true freedom and completely trusting them is the right thing, and it&#39;s what is making Ryan and I grow and grow and grow like we&#39;ve never grown before.  I just so want to have the experience of hanging out with parents who don&#39;t set limits, and to experience for myself firsthand that the kids are turning out just fine, and are in fact<br/>
 great kids.  I mean I&#39;ve read about lots of your kids here and in books and on websites, and I&#39;m sure they ARE great, but it&#39;s all still so far-removed from my in-the-flesh reality that my crazy brain still engages with bullshit about whether I&#39;m doing the right thing or not.  I would LOVE to make it to a conference, but they&#39;re just too darn far away, and we just don&#39;t have the money to do it this year, so for now, I just feel lonely in radical-unschooling land!  I was so excited today about meeting some long-time unschoolers, and it turned out so differently than I expected.  Thanks for listening, I honestly don&#39;t know where else to pour out this discouragement.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1464425121">We had that problem with the unschooling group here, and so a friend  <br/>
started a new unschooling group.  It wasn&#39;t radical enough for some  <br/>
(because we had a list of expectations, a must after someone&#39;s child  <br/>
destroyed a rec center room we were using) and so they started  <br/>
another group. Surely there are others in your area who are more  <br/>
radical?<br/>
<br/>
I know it&#39;s hard. When I was in the first group, I felt so dragged  <br/>
down by all the &quot;I unschool except math,&quot; and a lot of the limits  <br/>
talk. I stopped going to anything because frankly, it was easier to  <br/>
be around NO ONE than it was to be around unschoolers who were  <br/>
undermining my radical adventures.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re welcome to come visit us for a while. I don&#39;t know how far  <br/>

Jodi  I feel your pain!  We are actually going to the LnL conference this<br/>
year.  I need to see Unschooling and what it looks like.  I need to meet<br/>
some of the people on this list.  More importantly, dh needs to meet some of<br/>
the dads (wink, wink).<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
{by the waywell be the very tall African Americans with four kids and<br/>
ethnic names  it wont be hard to spot us :) }<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I am around other homeschoolers/Unschoolers, but they still believe in<br/>
chores, bedtimes, adults as authority, etc.  It makes me cringe.  And I know<br/>
Im seen as the radical mama  Im okay with that though.  As a matter of<br/>
fact, I think the only person near me is Jane and I never seem to get a<br/>
chance to hook up with her.  And she has four kids the same ages as mine!<br/>
Sheesh!  Well have to make a play date and stick to it.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I think Ive been on this list just about as long as you have and I *still*<br/>
feel like a newbie!  I guess that means that every day is a new day and we<br/>
are still learning  we  are still Unschooling ourselves.<br/>

When a big kid hits a little kid on the playground, we call him a bully;<br/>
five years later he punches a woman for her wallet and is called a mugger;<br/>
later still, when he slugs a fellow worker who insults him, he is called a<br/>
troublemaker, but when he becomes a father and hits his tiresome,<br/>
disobedient or disrespectful child, we call him a disciplinarian. Why is<br/>
this rung on a ladder of interpersonal violence regarded so differently from<br/>
the rest? ~ Penelope Leach<br/>
 Don&#39;t be afraid of showing affection. Be warm and tender, thoughtful and<br/>
affectionate. Mankind is more helped by sympathy than by service. Love is<br/>
more than money, and a kind word will give more pleasure than a present. <br/>

I have found myself distancing from my friends who were AP and <br/>
homeschoolers because they have so many rules and restrictions on <br/>
their kids. I wouldn&#39;t mind that so much if the kids didn&#39;t look so <br/>
sad and forlorn, especially when they see my child eating something <br/>
they can&#39;t have or hear him talk about a TV show they can&#39;t watch. <br/>
Then, of course, there are the looks from the other parents that <br/>
convey that they think I am contributing to the downfall of society. <br/>
How could I possibly let my child watch Cartoon Network when he&#39;s <br/>
only 4?! I haven&#39;t had any luck meeting others like me, either. I&#39;ve <br/>
resigned myself to the fact that, for now at least, I&#39;ll have to <br/>
find support, help, info, sanctuary online.<br/>
