<div id="ygrps-yiv-2112723108">It wasnt bad but it wasnt great either... I was disappointed with the catch  <br/>
phrase at the bottome of the screen  Unschooling = Unbelievable.  The  mom the <br/>
chatted with had a 6 yr old  which is great but I have yet to see  anything <br/>
on older kids.  Pat Farenga was interviewed which I was glad he  made the point <br/>
that homeschooling/unschooling your kids shouldnt be just because  of schools <br/>
being unsafe  anyhow I guess im kinda rambling Oh the other big  peice that <br/>
bugged me was at the end the reporter gave the info that ANYONE  who is <br/>
thinking of homeschooling should contact their states Dept of  Education to get the <br/>
right permission.....  Geraldo at Large is on Fox if  anyone wants to look for <br/>
it  it was on here in the Chicago area at  4:30  its on later in different <br/>
areas.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-723390527">Thanks for the information.  We have a local radio personality in Orlando, that is always making nasty references to homeschooling.  He probably has never heard of unschooling and as he is so negative I hope he never does.  I wish people would get an education on things before they bad mouth it.  <br/>
   <br/>
   That&#39;s why I joined this page!  So I could learn more about unschooling!  And I can say that you all are great!  I find with unschooling, my son is learning MORE and we&#39;ve only just begun....<br/>
