<div id="ygrps-yiv-447335860">Hi all! Does anyone have any suggestions about learning to read <br/>
Japanese written language, inotherwords the Kanji? My ds has long been <br/>
wanting to read Japanese in order to understand games, manga and anime <br/>
that are not yet translated. Is this at all realistic? I asked someone <br/>
who is fluent in Japanese. She said that this was hard to do and he <br/>
should begin by learning to speak Japanese first or learning the <br/>
westernized written language ( I forget what that&#39;s called). This is <br/>
not what currently interests him, however. Any of your children have <br/>
experience with taking on learning how to read the Kanji? How did they <br/>
do it?<br/>
Thanks, Andrea</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-155407014">Hello Andrea,<br/>
<br/>
learning Japanese is realisitic! It&#39;s is not as hard as people say.  <br/>
People keep saying it&#39;s hard, then they thing it&#39;s hard, and then  <br/>
it&#39;s hard :D<br/>
<br/>
I studied Japanese with a great teacher at university. First of all,  <br/>
you need to know that Japanese has three different writing systems  <br/>
and they are all needed! Kanji are the signs which were taken from  <br/>
Chinese language hundreds or thousands of years ago (I don&#39;t remember  <br/>
how many ;-) ). So they took these signs for some words, but because  <br/>
the grammar is different, they needed to add other signs which would  <br/>
indicate the grammatical meanings (past, present, possession and so  <br/>
many other things). Some monks invented Katakana, which is a sylable  <br/>
system. It&#39;s like an ABC, but there is a sign for each sylable, so  <br/>
ma, me, mi, mo, mu have all different signs, and la le li lo lu have  <br/>
all different signs and so on, all the possible combinations have  <br/>
different sounds – in Japanese a sylable is always one consonant and  <br/>
one vowel. But then! They thought women were too dumb to learn that  <br/>
and they weren&#39;t allowed, but because women wanted to read and write  <br/>
love stories, they invented one of their own, called Hiragana. This  <br/>
is also a system of sylables.<br/>
<br/>
Nowadays Katakana is used for all the words which come from abroad,  <br/>
like coca-cola, computer, mac donalds (and because the sylables have  <br/>
to be consonant+vowel, and because they have not &quot;l&quot;, they would  <br/>
spell out with sylabic symbols &quot;ma-ku-do-na-ru-do&quot; for mac-donalds :D  <br/>
or &quot;bo-yu-fu-re-n-do&quot; for boyfriend (&quot;n&quot; being the only one-consonant  <br/>
sylable possible). :D ah... were was I? Hiragana is used for all  <br/>
grammatical features that one might need (words like &quot;and&quot;, &quot;to&quot;,  <br/>
&quot;when&quot; and showing past tenste and so on – these are added to the  <br/>
Kanji, the main words.<br/>
<br/>
So normally, as learners, one starts learning both Hiragana (it takes  <br/>
a few weeks but it is not as difficult and there are many tricks to  <br/>
learn the sylables) and some Kanji. Then one starts learning the  <br/>
Katakana. One never stops learning new Kanji. But with Hiragana and  <br/>
Katakana one can already spell any word you need and japanese  <br/>
children learn this at firs as well, so they can just write all they  <br/>
want until they know enough Kanjisymbols. One generally needs around  <br/>
5000 Kanji to understand a newspaper, and I&#39;ve seen students who are  <br/>
really so interested in learning them, that they will do quite quickly.<br/>
<br/>
A good trick is to write the Kanji on small stickies and put them on  <br/>
the things they describe. Seeing them everyday caused a friend of  <br/>
mine learn all of them (about things around the house).<br/>
<br/>
With Kanji alone he won&#39;t be able to read anything, he&#39;ll just grasp  <br/>
a little bit what it&#39;s about. He definetly needs Hiragana as well,  <br/>
and the westernized thing won&#39;t help at all. Katakana can come next.<br/>

<br/>
Trick for learning Hiragana: look at each hiragana symbol and imagine  <br/>
what it could look like. Try to make it look like something that  <br/>
starts with the same sylable in English. For instance  the hiragana  <br/>
symbol for &quot;a&quot; could be an &quot;anchor&quot;. Draw an anchor into the hiragana  <br/>
symbol so that it fits somehow. Later you&#39;ll need to think of the  <br/>
word you chose - &quot;a - anchor ;  aha, yes that was the one that looks  <br/>
like an anchor&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Tricks for learning Kanji: I learned them by writing them down  <br/>
thousands of times. My friend learned them by writing them very  <br/>
beautifully like calligriphy and putting them on the things in her  <br/>
house. Another friend would try to figure how it would represent that  <br/>
thing (they are derived from former symbols which used to represent  <br/>
these things). Others would make cards with one side a Kanji, one  <br/>
side the german word (I did this too and it helps).<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Emily is learning Japanese!  Kanji (at least Japanese kanji) is a<br/>
phonetic written language IOW each part of the symbol represents a<br/>
sound just like the Roman alphabet that we use.  Learning it in<br/>
conjunction is not as difficult as one would think.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been hunting for this book myself and when I find it again I&#39;ll<br/>
post about it.  The book is a flip book that has the kanji and then<br/>
the sound that is represented by that kanji.  Emily has an internet<br/>
friend who can read kanji, but doesn&#39;t speak Japanese, so Emily and S<br/>
are constantly back and forth on &quot;what does this say&quot; and &quot;what does<br/>
this mean&quot;  LOL!   Emily has gotten a lot of help in her language<br/>
studies by watching Japanese anime (particularly Fruits Basket which<br/>
has an English manga)  Most of the Fruba that she has found on line<br/>
has been in Japanese with English subtitles.<br/>
<br/>
Call your local university or college and see if they have a Japanese<br/>
language program.  Emily has been invited by the Japanese instructor<br/>
here to take the Japanese immersion class in the summer.  They have a<br/>
Japanese cultural center on the campus and Emily is considering taking<br/>
a 10 week long class in tea ceremony.<br/>

There is also a kanji area there too.<br/>
<br/>
The way I learned Japanese when I was younger was to make a chart with <br/>
all the characters and memorize it - since I&#39;m a visual learner.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it would be difficult to learn Kanji at a young age - <br/>
not as difficult as conjugating verbs in Spanish - LOL.<br/>

Unschooling is realistic! It&#39;s not as hard as people say! People keep <br/>
saying it&#39;s hard, then they think it&#39;s hard, and then it&#39;s hard!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1780318598">Hi,<br/>
I can&#39;t tell you about my children, they are into mastering the latin and cyrilic scripts at the moment, but I&#39;m learning Chinese. Actually, I started long time ago, and never could quite handle having to learn the character, its pronunciation, and its meaning(s) at once.<br/>
<br/>
So, quite recently, I decided to learn the meanings only, in order to start reading and understanding at a decent level, since I learn (languages) through reading, mostly. I still have to try it, but to me it seems to make sense. Anyway, I think that me (and your son) will pick up the pronunciation as a &quot;side-efect&quot; anyway, sooner or later.<br/>
<br/>
So my advise is - get a dictionary, get acquainted with the radicals (components of the characters, used to classify them) and start looking up the characters!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1942556568">Something else that Emily pointed out to me that I didn&#39;t realize is<br/>
that all through the Fruits Basket Manga there is kanji for different<br/>
sounds, words, and actions.  In the back (front to the US) of the<br/>
manga there is a list of these words, their Japanese name or sound and<br/>
then the English translation.  I&#39;ve started recognizing some of them<br/>
(I&#39;m reading the series myself right now).<br/>
