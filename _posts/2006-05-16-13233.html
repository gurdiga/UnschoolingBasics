<div id="ygrps-yiv-803753927">The clothing thing has come up for us.  I am quite crunchy, my 15yo dd <br/>
is not &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
She loves the mall, the latest fashions, being &quot;preppy&quot;.  Heaven to <br/>
her is the Aeropostale store and a latte &lt;sigh&gt; while her mom enjoys <br/>
farmer&#39;s markets and NEVER going clothes shopping.<br/>
<br/>
The way we have handled it.....<br/>
<br/>
I give her as much spending money as I can considering we have 5 kids <br/>
on one income and everyone has their passions.  I also am available to <br/>
support her earning more money.  I drive her to babysit.  She worked at <br/>
the local gym for 3 years.  It works for us as long as I am VERY <br/>
flexible about providing transportation.<br/>
<br/>
I also even drive her and friends to the mall.  While they run the <br/>
mall, spending all their disposable income, I drink one small soda and <br/>
read Mother Earth News. &lt;grin&gt;<br/>

 <br/>
My daughter too has a love for clothes and cooking.  For the clothes she loves the limited too and that can be expensive but what we found was a book that helps you know your style and then we watched the movie pretty in pink and how Molly ringwald took old clothes and put them together for her own style and that helps my daughter with the way she shops and how much she spends.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1900195876">Hi all!<br/>
<br/>
I am brand new to this list.  We&#39;ve been unschooling this year with my<br/>
ds who is 6 and my ds who is 3.  We are loving it!<br/>
<br/>
This subject reminded me of a book I bought a LONG time ago after<br/>
seeing the author interviewed somewhere... don&#39;t remember where LOL.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s called &quot;Capitate Your Kids&quot;<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0142000922/sr=8-1/qid=1147784262/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-7047441-8720712?%5Fencoding=UTF8">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0142000922/sr=8-1/qid=1147784262/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-7047441-8720712?%5Fencoding=UTF8</a><br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all about slowly turning financial control over to your kids,<br/>
starting small with a clothing allowance, and letting them spend as<br/>
they wish, but not bailing them out when they mess up.  It&#39;s VERY<br/>
unschooling in it&#39;s approach to money and I think it&#39;s awesome!  <br/>
<br/>
My boys are too young still for the approach, but we plan to use the<br/>
approach in a few years.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve started teaching our older ds about money and budgeting by<br/>
giving him an allowance (not tied to anything) and four &quot;banks&quot; (mason<br/>
jars that he decorated) one bank each for Save (savings for a &quot;big&quot;<br/>
purchase such as a gameboy, new bike, etc. We will kick in a<br/>
percentage once he&#39;s saved a good chunk of the money needed), SPend<br/>
(for immediate spending on WHATEVER he wants), Donate (charity) and<br/>
Invest (long-term savings.  Each quarter we&#39;ll send his money to our<br/>
broker who will put it into his investment fund).  He gets $4 a week<br/>
and has to put at least $1 in invest and at least 50 cents into Donate<br/>
(he can put more if he wants to).  SPend and save, he can decide how<br/>
much to put in.  Eventhough we&#39;ve only been doing this for a couple of<br/>
months, it&#39;s already had a huge impact on the &quot;gimmes&quot;... when I tell<br/>
him he&#39;s welcome to spend HIS money on something, it becomes an<br/>
entirely different ballgame to him LOLOL.<br/>
<br/>
ANyways, I hope that helps someone :)<br/>
<br/>
This list ROCKS!<br/>
<br/>

Sometimes they decide to spend it all on something they want.  Sometimes<br/>
they decide to give most of it away to a charitable cause.  Sometimes they<br/>
will pool their money together to get something and sometimes they will save<br/>
for long periods of time to reach a goal.  A much better &quot;learning tool&quot;<br/>
than mason jars with labels. Most adults don&#39;t understand investment banking<br/>
but can understand a &quot;Vacation fund.&quot;<br/>

&quot;You can have this money, but only if you put some in savings and<br/>
donations.&quot;  That isn&#39;t truly giving him free control over his money.  You<br/>
are still dictating a portion of his money.  I doubt he sees the money that<br/>
he has to put in these jars as having freewill over his money.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1733730983">I totally agree Michelle. <br/>
<br/>
All of us, kids and mom and dad, get a certain amount of &quot;mad money&quot; every<br/>
week or so when we can afford it. It&#39;s not tied to anything, just extra cash<br/>
to save or spend on whatever we want. Sometimes the kids want my opinion on<br/>
their purchase and I&#39;ll tell them what I think, sometimes they don&#39;t. I make<br/>
suggestions and try to help them to be savvy consumers. Sometimes I&#39;ll bring<br/>
up a point that they may not have thought of, &quot;That looks kind of flimsy, I<br/>
don&#39;t think it will last long at all.&quot; That kind of thing but they are free<br/>
to purchase it no matter what I think. If they make a bad purchase I will<br/>
help them to return it, just like I do when I make a bad purchase. I don&#39;t<br/>
understand why we would not extend a child the help they need to return or<br/>
exchange an item just as we would do for ourselves. Why do you call it<br/>
bailing them out? How about just helping them? What would you call it if it<br/>
was your husband asking you to return a bad purchase for him? Would you<br/>
still consider it &quot;bailing out?&quot; I can&#39;t count the amount of bad purchases<br/>
I&#39;ve made in my life. I&#39;m always grateful when I can recoup my losses and<br/>
learn from it. I think kids having spending money is important for learning<br/>
about the real world and how it works. Children can learn a lot from bad<br/>
purchases, maybe more than from good purchases. Make it a learning moment.<br/>
Help shed light on the situation. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-890928818">***How about just helping them?***<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve returned a few things in my life and I&#39;ve helped Dylan make returns.<br/>
  He bought the extended version of Dune and it simply wouldn&#39;t play<br/>
certain scenes.   We drove fifty five miles to exchange it.  I&#39;d have<br/>
done it for David (dh) or my mom or myself so why not Dylan? <br/>
<br/>
I bought a lovely birdbath and some night creature tipped it over and it<br/>
broke.  I was so sad.  I couldn&#39;t return it but it was nice to get a<br/>
little sympathy.  &lt;g&gt;    Then, my dear son bought me a new one for<br/>
Mothers day.  <br/>
<br/>
If Dylan spent his money on something that turned out to be a mistake I&#39;d<br/>
likely give him more money and I&#39;d offer my sympathy and I&#39;d help him go<br/>
find what he really wanted.   Better he makes money mistakes into<br/>
adulthood (like most of us have) than relationship mistakes if he learned<br/>
how to be stingy and unyielding and unsympathetic at home with his<br/>
parents.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1160193927">Sorry, in my haste to post a quick and short message, I left out A LOT of the content.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not &quot;not helping&quot;.... part of the issue is that he feels you need to be very flexible <br/>
according to your kids&#39; ages and abilities, so what works for one, might not be the right <br/>
way for another.<br/>
<br/>
ANother thing, is that he feels (and I strongly agree) that if an older child, who has been <br/>
doing this for a while, has a clothing allowance of say $500 a year (just for a round <br/>
number), then goes out and spends $450 the first week on a trendy leather coat, that <br/>
means s/he&#39;ll only have $50 to buy the REST OF THEIR CLOTHES.  This is a HUGE learning <br/>
opportunity for them.  THey learn that you mean what you say, that when the money is <br/>
gone, it&#39;s GONE.  Now, he also says (it&#39;s been a while since I read the book, so I am <br/>
probably botching this LOL) that the opportunity for learning goes both ways, parents can <br/>
learn how to help without enabling.  If you ALWAYS come across with more cash, every <br/>
time they blow their money (and they WILL blow it), then they aren&#39;t learning the natural <br/>
consequence of money mismanagement.  If, however, they make an honest mistake and <br/>
come up short, they learn the lesson, even if you agree to help them out of the bind.<br/>
<br/>
You have to expect them to make mistakes, then help them to learn from them, rather <br/>
than simply expect you, the parent, to fix it for them.<br/>
<br/>
See the difference?  I hope that made sense. I don&#39;t see anything positive in constantly <br/>
enabling kids to grow up without financial smarts by bailing them out time after time.<br/>
<br/>
Lo<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1323686111">yay! My hubby is so nervous about the girls hitting puberty and  <br/>
becoming clothes sharks. I can see me like you....going as much as i  <br/>
can handle with them, and then meeting them in the  food court. (my  <br/>
favorite shopping experience ;-)  )<br/>
<br/>
They already have their own taste in clothes, which thrills me to no  <br/>
end that I can support that. My mom was the kind that never took me  <br/>
shopping, she bought whatever was on sale and then guilted me into  <br/>
being grateful no matter what. Blech. But I&#39;m not bitter lol!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2066204570">Hi All,<br/>
I just wanted to post about our money dealings. <br/>
<br/>
I have a monthly budget for myself, bills, food and so on...I keep <br/>
it in a budget book that sits out and the kids can look and see what <br/>
bills we have and where our family money goes.<br/>
<br/>
Part of my budget includes vacations and house projects.<br/>
<br/>
The kids, I have seven at home, all have their money too. <br/>
<br/>
They each get a sum of money from me to spend on whatever they want.<br/>
It is written directly into my budget. The one who works also gets <br/>
that money from me. She is still entitled to a share of our <br/>
resources.<br/>
<br/>
When I first started this they were skeptical that I would just let <br/>
them spend their money on whatever. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;What if I want to buy all candy?&quot; It was their money no strings <br/>
attached. That was a tough piece for me.<br/>
<br/>
However it is also your movie money, and doing stuff money.<br/>
<br/>
We had a family trip to the coast in April. We looked at all the <br/>
things there were to do there on the internet months before. I <br/>
figured I could pay for the house we were renting, buy all the food, <br/>
kites and toys we needed. I budgeted in paying for everyone to go <br/>
the aquarium one day. Anything else they chose to do they needed to <br/>
finance.  <br/>
<br/>
The kids had three months to save , if they chose to save. My <br/>
daughter with a job saved and did outlet shopping. I had two boys <br/>
who went deep sea fishing. I had three more that went whale <br/>
watching. I had kids buy surf boards and rent wet suits. <br/>
<br/>
During that three months the kids had big financial decisions to <br/>
make. My 12 year old wanted to buy speakers for his MP3 player so it <br/>
would play in his room. He also really wanted to surf and go <br/>
fishing. We did the math together and he figured he could get a <br/>
cheaper set of speakers and still do the things he wanted to.<br/>
<br/>
I had one child who was a bit short of getting what they needed. I <br/>
gave them the money. I really want a bit of help when I am close to <br/>
my goal on something. <br/>
<br/>
I am not saying this is for everyone. I just wanted to share it <br/>
because I think my kids have learned and prioritized  so much.<br/>
<br/>
The movie was a great example. The first movie after their money <br/>
began coming to them was truly priceless. Before when I would take <br/>
them to the show they all wanted popcorn, soda and and candy. When <br/>
we planned to go to the show dutch I had several kids who despite <br/>
having the cash in hand chose no snacks, while several others loaded <br/>
up.<br/>

parent provide that need for your child?  What happens when you have a need<br/>
and you don&#39;t have the money?  Do you just go without or do you use a credit<br/>
card or work to make more money or do without something else?  I don&#39;t see<br/>
this as a &quot;learning opportunity&quot; but as a set up for failure.  &quot;Oh see.  You<br/>
don&#39;t know how to handle money.  I guess your up a creek without a paddle.<br/>
So sad.  Too bad.&quot;  What does that tell your child about how you feel about<br/>
him/her?  Isn&#39;t the relationship more important than a &quot;lesson?&quot;  Our<br/>
children do learn about how money works because we talk to our children<br/>
about finances and saving and expenditures.  They understand that if we want<br/>
to go to Disney World every year that we have to save money.  That means not<br/>
eating out as much and cutting back on other things. If we want to do<br/>
something special for a weekend we have to look at how that impacts our<br/>
family&#39;s budget.  Going to the movies is a $35 outpouring just to get in the<br/>
door and we dont&#39; have a dollar theater anymore :(  If we want popcorn<br/>
that&#39;s even more money.  So we weigh whether we want to go to the movies or<br/>
whether we want to go to the video store and rent (or buy) a movie instead.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A child doesn&#39;t have to be set up for failure in order to learn a lesson.<br/>
Handing a child $500 and saying, &quot;This is your yearly clothing allowance -<br/>
use it well&quot; is disaster waiting to happen!  For some kids they will make<br/>
wise decisions, but for others that is a lot of money to be entrusting them<br/>
with.<br/>

It&#39;s not &quot;not helping&quot;.... part of the issue is that he feels you need <br/>
to be<br/>
very flexible<br/>
according to your kids&#39; ages and abilities, so what works for one, <br/>
might not be<br/>
the right<br/>
way for another.<br/>
<br/>
ANother thing, is that he feels (and I strongly agree) that if an older <br/>
child,<br/>
who has been<br/>
doing this for a while, has a clothing allowance of say $500 a year <br/>
(just for a<br/>
round<br/>
number), then goes out and spends $450 the first week on a trendy <br/>
leather coat,<br/>
that<br/>
means s/he&#39;ll only have $50 to buy the REST OF THEIR CLOTHES.  This is <br/>
a HUGE<br/>
learning<br/>
opportunity for them.  THey learn that you mean what you say, that when <br/>
the<br/>
money is<br/>
gone, it&#39;s GONE.  Now, he also says (it&#39;s been a while since I read the <br/>
book, so<br/>
I am<br/>
probably botching this LOL) that the opportunity for learning goes both <br/>
ways,<br/>
parents can<br/>
learn how to help without enabling.  If you ALWAYS come across with <br/>
more cash,<br/>
every<br/>
time they blow their money , then they aren&#39;t learning<br/>
the natural<br/>
consequence of money mismanagement.  If, however, they make an honest <br/>
mistake<br/>
and<br/>
come up short, they learn the lesson, even if you agree to help them <br/>
out of the<br/>
bind.<br/>
<br/>
You have to expect them to make mistakes, then help them to learn from <br/>
them,<br/>
rather<br/>
than simply expect you, the parent, to fix it for them.<br/>
<br/>
See the difference?  I hope that made sense. I don&#39;t see anything <br/>
positive in<br/>
constantly<br/>
enabling kids to grow up without financial smarts by bailing them out <br/>
time after<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
i know you&#39;re expecting us to see the difference.  But several of us <br/>
will try to ecplain why that&#39;s NOT the best way.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re setting them up to fail. You&#39;re setting them up with the <br/>
expectation that they WILL &lt;&lt;(and they WILL blow it)&gt;&gt; not be able to <br/>
handle it. Then you will refuse to help when they need it.<br/>
<br/>
Loss of trust. Loss of respect.<br/>
<br/>
I *do* expect them to make mistakes. I *do* help them learn from them. <br/>
And I *do* expect them to know I&#39;ll do anything in my power to fix <br/>
things for them.<br/>
<br/>
I won&#39;t be bailing them out. I will be helping them learn. They will be <br/>
learning that they can trust me, even if they DO fail. They won&#39;t be <br/>
expecting me to throw how they failed (again) to do it right or my way.<br/>
<br/>
*Life* sets up plenty of these real situations. You don&#39;t need to set <br/>
them up artificially, as school does. Be bigger and better than <br/>
schools! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

ages for a while, but mostly if I had the money I would give it to <br/>
the kids to buy what they wanted. <br/>

<br/>
 We&#39;ve started teaching our older ds about money and budgeting by<br/>
 giving him an allowance (not tied to anything) and four &quot;banks&quot; (mason<br/>
 jars that he decorated) one bank each for Save (savings for a &quot;big&quot;<br/>
 purchase such as a gameboy, new bike, etc. We will kick in a<br/>
 percentage once he&#39;s saved a good chunk of the money needed), SPend<br/>
 (for immediate spending on WHATEVER he wants), Donate (charity) and<br/>
 Invest (long-term savings. Each quarter we&#39;ll send his money to our<br/>
 broker who will put it into his investment fund). He gets $4 a week<br/>
 and has to put at least $1 in invest and at least 50 cents into Donate<br/>
 (he can put more if he wants to). SPend and save, he can decide how<br/>
 much to put in. Eventhough we&#39;ve only been doing this for a couple of<br/>
 months, it&#39;s already had a huge impact on the &quot;gimmes&quot;... when I tell<br/>
 him he&#39;s welcome to spend HIS money on something, it becomes an<br/>
 entirely different ballgame to him<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  That might work IF *you* keep your money in little mason jars and are <br/>
required to do the same. Does your husband make you do that? Does his <br/>
boss make him do that?<br/>
<br/>
  John Holt said that children can lead lives with purpose. Making an <br/>
artificial environment when a real one will do is silly.<br/>
<br/>
  ANother point that was brought up on another list a couple of years <br/>
ago is to give the child enough $$ to make it reasonable to save or <br/>
spend.<br/>
<br/>
  We used to give Duncan $2/week. There&#39;s really nothing he could buy <br/>
with $2. For him to buy something he really wanted (at $50), he&#39;d have <br/>
to save for six months! *Forever* for a nine year old! This poster <br/>
suggested that an amount that could actually purchase something the <br/>
child would want would result in better money management.<br/>
<br/>
 Boy, that WORKS! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  We upped Duncan&#39;s allowance to $25/month. He plans what he will <br/>
buy/how much he will save. I was informed yesterday that $25 can buy <br/>
two mangas and a pack of Yu-Gi-Oh! cards OR a used video game OR half <br/>
of a new video game. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>For the clothing money, we figured out how much we could reasonably  <br/>
spend on clothes and gave them all of it. We figured that out by  <br/>
looking at our spending on clothes over the previous year and then  <br/>
talked about how spending more on clothes would mean spending less on  <br/>
something else. We agreed on an amount together.<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t start doing this until they wanted to do it and it was when  <br/>
they were around 13 or 14 years old. Before that, we just gave them  <br/>
money to buy stuff if we could - didn&#39;t try to stick to an allowance  <br/>
schedule. We&#39;d never had arguments or difficulties about buying stuff  <br/>
before that. I think it helps to sort of have an established  <br/>
&quot;standard of living&quot; that the kids get used to, maybe.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We started when DS was about 5 I believe (maybe between 5 and 6?) He <br/>
had gotten a gift card and was very careful and considered about <br/>
using it so we figured he was about ready to handle some of his own <br/>
money. We got him a small wallet too - a velcro closure jogger style <br/>
thing. I was talking to a co-worker about it when we were trying to <br/>
figure out the how much question and she said what she had done with <br/>
her DD (who was graduating college at the time) was that from 5 to 9 <br/>
she got $5 per week, from 10-about 14 I think (if I remember <br/>
correctly) it was $10 per week, at 15 it went to $15 per week and <br/>
stayed there - because at 15 or 16 you can get a part time job, <br/>
babysit, etc and earn any additional you might want. It&#39;s mostly <br/>
based on the idea that up to a certain age, the immediate wants are <br/>
typically (not always) less expensive - a soda, a small toy, etc. By <br/>
age 10 or 11, kids may want to go to a movie with friends WITHOUT <br/>
parents holding their hand so their funds need to be adequate for <br/>
them to do something like that fairly readily (within a week or two <br/>
of allowance). And teens are more likely to want to go out to get a <br/>
small meal or snack with friends and that sort of thing which is <br/>
more expensive still potentially.<br/>
<br/>
As it is, DS gets &quot;paid&quot; when I get paid twice a month which means <br/>
$10 each &quot;pay day&quot;. He has free rein with how he uses it - and he <br/>
typically has more cash on hand than I do lol (of course I have the <br/>
car, the checkbook, the ATM card and the credit card). Sometimes <br/>
he&#39;ll agree to treat me when we go out on our weekly &quot;date&quot; (such as <br/>
an iced chai at Starbucks); sometimes we go &quot;dutch&quot; and sometimes I <br/>
pay. He has several times saved his money for several weeks in order <br/>
to get a specific item. And currently I&#39;m keeping his allowance as <br/>
he wanted something that would cost 2 allowances. He didn&#39;t want to <br/>
wait so I &quot;fronted&quot; the money and he is not getting his allowance <br/>
until June 15 - all spelled out clearly at the time and he agreed. <br/>
So it goes.<br/>

***How about just helping them?***<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid, I used to make lots of money.  I started babysitting at a<br/>
young age and got a job in our church nursery at 14 or 15.  When I turned 16<br/>
I got a job at a local grocery store.  I had more friends there than at<br/>
school, so I&#39;d work all the hours I could.  My parents never put a limit on<br/>
my spending, I had to buy anything I wanted not necessarily needed b/c my<br/>
dad was out of work for a long time.  Anyway, when I was about 17 my mom was<br/>
helping me to balance my checkbook that had gotten all out of whack.  Once<br/>
she got it balanced she pointed out to me how much I was spending by telling<br/>
me how much I had made that year and what I had left.  That left a bigger<br/>
impression on me to save than if she&#39;d forced me to put some of my hard<br/>
earned money away.<br/>

<br/>
My 15yo dd has her own cell phone with the agreement that she pays the <br/>
charges out of her spending money.  I worked really hard to not say <br/>
anything about all the texting charges.  Finally, I gently and non-<br/>
judgementally pointed out that after paying all the charges it was like <br/>
I was only giving her 7 dollars in spending money each month.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think she had ever compared her income to her spending <br/>
before.....she just had the money so she spent it.  The texting dropped <br/>
drastically, she asked all of her friends to not text her anymore and <br/>
this month, there was a whole 4 dollars in texting charges.<br/>
