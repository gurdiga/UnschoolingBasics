<div id="ygrps-yiv-1022667696">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;It&#39;s especially hard with Jalen who will wear the most torn up, <br/>
dirty<br/>
clothing everywhere (his faves) and who cuts his own hair because<br/>
having someone else do it is sensory overload for him. I&#39;m sure he<br/>
looks neglected to other people sometimes. We&#39;re learned to do a lot<br/>
of letting go...:)<br/>

biased as his auntie!<br/>
