<div id="ygrps-yiv-33261223">Hello Kelly,<br/>
 <br/>
First, please do not allow fear to get in the way of thinking. Cutting is a form of self harm that is like over eating, or like an adults alcohol. It is NOT a suidice attempt, normally. I did a lot of research because I am a life loving and happy optimist who went through a year of hell and I began cutting. I found my entire world turned upside down and I did not know how to deal with it. Imagine losing 60 days of your life, your kids, all of your life&#39;s work, reputation, home, country, stuff (adding up to well over $2 million dollars) and lifestyle in general... I felt I wanted to scream out because no one could &quot;relate&quot; to what I went through... At times the pain got so great, and I needed to speak - but again, no one could comprehend or even address the issues that were so overwhelming to me. I literally felt as though I HAD to let and allow some pain out of my body, in a SYMBOLIC way... I felt that if I allowed a small slash in my skin, the pain<br/>
 would exit, and I would not blow up from the inside out. I know for those who have no idea how this works, it does not make too much sense... but it just &quot;felt&quot; like the only coping mechanism I had at the time. My throat chakra felt totally closed, I felt suppressed in expressing the overwhelming grief and betrayal, the deep attack on everything I had ever held as pure and sacred. <br/>
 <br/>
To this day, I would say that my family allowing me to sit in my corner or closet for those few very challenging months and cut without baker acting me, saved my life...  So I ask that you consider this... what could she be having trouble coping with. I am 44, and my mom wanted me to speak to her, to talk it out... but again, no words could express how I felt. The anguish was terrifying and too real, and I literally felt if I did not cut small - then I would have a stroke, heart attack, total nervous breakdown, or just drop dead.....<br/>
 <br/>
No one ever counseled me, and it left the same way it came into my life, one day I just realized it was ugly, I did not feel &quot;pretty&quot; or &quot;sane&quot; with those marks... and they did not get me the help I was wanting... what got me what I wanted was the love and support of my family who told me they loved me very much and would support and understand what I was going through.<br/>
 <br/>
From a physical standpoint, certain hormones/chemicals are released that act as a natural &quot;valium&quot; and downer to actually prevent a larger type of self attack... it calms, and it makes one feel somehow validated in the experience of pain.<br/>
 <br/>
I have a LOT of literature and links, sites I could recommend... I just wanted to suggest that you do not attack her with &quot;what the hell is wrong with you&quot; or &quot;why are you trying to kill yourself&quot; because that is NOT the attention she needs.... it is a very tough call, because in my opinion, when the person gets to that place, they really feel totally overwhelmed where &quot;logical&quot; talkingt is no longer effective... and yet it needs to be discussed in a non intrusive way, non judgmental way.  The &quot;high&quot; your body goes through is addictive too - so what may have started as a quick way to cope, or to try something peers are doing, has become a &quot;high&quot; for her....<br/>
 <br/>
Too many thoughts in my mind, too many possibilities - I just wanted to add this and offer some of my links, writing, sites if you need.... <br/>
 <br/>
Hold her in the highest light.... <br/>
<br/>
To Your Continued Growth & Success!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1390757135">To the best of my understanding Cutting is one way teenagers have found to &quot;feel&quot;. I didn&#39;t cut myself as a teen but I was engaged in other harmful behaviors to &quot;feel&quot; . The reason I put the word in quotes is because the word is sadly inadaquate and yet it&#39;s all I have to try and describe.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, as an unschooler I realize the challenges inherent in helping a child who may not want to be helped. So I&#39;m going to throw out there some suggestions from my heart and my experience as a teenager/young adult not as parent because my kids are still barely kindergarten and I haven&#39;t experienced the parental side of this equation. <br/>
<br/>
First in conversation I would be very careful to only state the obvious and stay as far away from assumptions as possible. <br/>
<br/>
First and foremost your daughter NEEDS to know absolutely that you accept her and love her no matter what she does exactly as she is. that if she cut herself every day for the rest of her life, if she were covered in scars you would still love and accept her.  <br/>
<br/>
Secondly, self harm is not something happy people do.<br/>
<br/>
Third, does she know why she is doing this? again reassure her that no matter what she says you will still love and accept her.<br/>
<br/>
Fourth, she may not know. Life is kinda funny that way. We don&#39;t always know why we do the things we do.<br/>
<br/>
Fifth, Does she want to stop? Does she see this as a problem? or is it something she wants to continue? or maybe she sees cutting herself as something out of her control something she just does and doesn&#39;t know why.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
the BBC has been running a discussion on cutting<br/>

<br/>
If she refuses help insist she start working out with you every day. At least 2 hours every day. Whatever she is physically drawn to. Swimming, ice skating, rock climbing, a gym membership whatever. Beg and plead if you have to. The working out balances most imbalances that may hormonally be affecting her and numbing her. The endorphins will make her feel better about herself and the exercise the mere action of intensly working out will help dissapate those feelings of numbness and loss.<br/>
<br/>
Of course I would love to hear she wanted to see a psych and entered a talk therapy program but the reality is that most people attach a stigma to that and won&#39;t go.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1736435667">I think talk therapy is often too direct and therefore ineffective because<br/>
some undergoing therapy usually don&#39;t feel like talking and feel worse<br/>
because they can&#39;t open up.<br/>
<br/>
There are other therapies.  Expressive arts therapies: music, art,<br/>
motion/dance.  I think the swimming idea is excellent.  Being with is great<br/>
if that&#39;s what is wanted.  Be open also to the teen who wants to accomplish<br/>
things on their own, and make the way clear to do so.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-422927076">i remember in college i wrote a poem about not being able to feel unless i was bleeding.? i looked forward to my period because of the cramping and blood.? it was the only time i really felt alive.? i never cut.? i agree with what someone else said about the bleeding letting out the negative.? i have never researched it, but i believe that menstruation is a time of healing and of letting go of more than just an unfertilized ovum.? i can see how if that wasn&#39;t enough, someone would cut to make the blood flow out.? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
it is so strange, the older i get, how i meet more and more people who are validating things i have felt throughout my life.? i know there must be a reason it is happening now as opposed to then, but it sure would&#39;ve been nice to not constantly feel like the odd one out before.? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1201395256">In high school I used to cut myself. I used to sit in my room in the evening feeling totally isolated and sad and confused, listening to something on my radio shack record player with the eight track tape deck, and I used a razor blade and cut around my ankles. It was about taking internal turmoil and giving it substance, making it real. My parents caught me at some point and freaked out. I ended up on the roof that night with them trying to grab me through the windows. They set me up with a counselor, Gaye McTate, who I&#39;d go see once a week. She was really nice. I think it helped a bit to have someone paid to listen to me and to talk to me for an hour a week. The best part was when she yelled at my dad for being late to a family meeting, arguing that I was at least as important as the clients he had at his office. My memory of my cutting is that it didn&#39;t stop. It was never very severe. It was always just minor cuts in my leg. I had a friend who carved<br/>
 words into her skin. Her need for release and expression was so much greater than mine. <br/>
<br/>
The cutting is a symptom. I know I stopped when I dropped out of high school. My life didn&#39;t get easier, but it became more mine. I know it started when my mom moved back home from living in another city to work. I know that her moving back took the control that I had expanded to live with outside of my hands and that it was hard to shrink to her requirements. There is something in your daughter&#39;s life that is making her feel out of control, or in so much turmoil that she needs to express it through cutting. I would recommend trying to find lots of cool and engaging things to do. I would not recommend damaging the trust that she has in her older sister by talking about her cutting and you know. <br/>

<br/>
I just found out my 15 year old daughter is cutting and I&#39;m totally <br/>
freaking out.  We had talked about cutting a few weeks ago because <br/>
her older sister who was visiting told me she had been cutting but <br/>
stopped.  I asked Lizzy if she knew and she did.  I felt like that <br/>
is something she should have talked to me about.  She said it&#39;s not <br/>
the kind of thing you talk to parents about.  She doesn&#39;t feel like <br/>
parents can do anything about it so it doesn&#39;t help if they know.  I <br/>
took her out of school in 8th grade because I was afraid of her <br/>
hurting herself like this.  Her sister just sent me a copy of a <br/>
conversation they have been having on myspace that Lizzy is cutting <br/>
and doesn&#39;t want to stop.  I haven&#39;t talked to her about it yet but <br/>
I feel like I&#39;m going to throw up right now. <br/>
<br/>
Please help me find the best way to deal with this.  My first <br/>
reaction is total mental chaos.  Send her to school, send her to <br/>
counseling, punish her, quit my job and watch her all day, MAKE her <br/>
take the antidepressants that she refused to take the last few <br/>
months.   I know really I can&#39;t make her stop but how can I help her <br/>
see that she should.  I don&#39;t understand this behavior but it seems <br/>
so much more common than when I was a kid.  It scares the shit out <br/>
of me.  Also her hiding things from me scares me. <br/>
<br/>
Our communication is better than it used to be but she has always <br/>
refused to talk about certain things.   I thought she was happy for <br/>
the most part though.  SHe has total control over just about <br/>
everything in her life.  I work with her to help her get whatever <br/>
she wants.  I don&#39;t punish her.  What else can I do?   SHe has <br/>
always had a certain negativity to her thinking but I didn&#39;t think <br/>
it was that bad for her anymore.   I am not going to talk to her <br/>
about this until I have thought about it and calmed down a <br/>
little. <br/>

My brother used to carve works on himself in his teens. He was very conflicted, in turmoil and a very sensitive guy. He also dropped out of high school and than met his girlfriend and moved out. He stopped when that happened. I wish I could ask him question bu he passed away young.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1828660295">My sister-in-law did this in junior high. Her parents went with the<br/>
&quot;What the hell are you doing to yourself&quot; approach. She refused all<br/>
&quot;help&quot;/medication/counseling. In her early 20s she is still not<br/>
functioning well.<br/>
<br/>
I agree that you should see if it works itself out. Don&#39;t start<br/>
looking at her funny or let on that you are worrying about her. It<br/>
would be awful if she found out that her sister shared this info with<br/>
you. I imagine she would feel betrayed and stop talking to her sister<br/>
about those things &quot;parents can do nothing about&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you could share some resources on other natural mood elevators<br/>
if she doesn&#39;t want to take the anti-depressants. Or you could ask her<br/>
sister to pass on the info about cutting- why it makes sense (the<br/>
natural chemical release stuff) and it might motivate her to look for<br/>
other things she can do to get that feeling, like jogging. The more<br/>
tools she has to deal with it on her own, the quicker she will admit<br/>
to herself that scabs aren&#39;t hot.<br/>
<br/>
My SIL is bi-polar and she is happier when she is busy. She also seems<br/>
to feel best about herself when she is helping or doing stuff for<br/>
others. Maybe you could set some &quot;get healthy(er)&quot; food and exercise<br/>
goals for yourself and ask your daughter to join you to help keep you<br/>
motivated and on track.</div>

Ask her what you can do. Even if no response becomes of it at first, she will know that you are available. You are already showing how much you care and that you are a wonderful mom by seeking help! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1913696516">A few things,<br/>
<br/>
Cutting is not always benign - it CAN be a suicide thing, or at the very least a wanting to <br/>
die thing. Take ANY cutting seriously.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with others that it is usually related to wanting to release emotional pain with <br/>
physical pain.<br/>
<br/>
Tell her you love her- she may not realize or believe you do- tell her directly. If you see <br/>
her in turmoil (crying or otherwise) talk to her, ask her whats wrong. Im sure you already <br/>
do these things but just reinforcing :)<br/>
<br/>
She sounds very sad, and dont feel betrayed that she didnt tell you, chances are she&#39;s well <br/>
aware that it would only make you feel bad too, and the only way out of this is within her. <br/>
All you can do is be there for her.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-342253142">Thanks to everyone who replied to my post both on and off list.  The <br/>
support and suggestions have been really helpful to me.  I didn&#39;t <br/>
handle the whole thing very well but things could have been worse.  <br/>
I tried to talk to her about it really calmly but then I did get mad <br/>
about it for a little bit.  We kind of kept our conversations about <br/>
it into short little bursts.  At first I felt personally betrayed <br/>
because I really felt like I had worked so hard to make her life <br/>
better and she still feels the need to be self destructive.  When <br/>
she left school in 8th grade I was very afraid of her cutting.  <br/>
Turns out she did it anyway and started after she left school.  That <br/>
kind of pisses me off.  Then again things probably could have been <br/>
so much worse if she had stayed in school.  She says she is not <br/>
depressed or suicidal and does not want to go to counseling.  She is <br/>
not quite ready to admit that it is a problem or something she needs <br/>
help with.  The one thing she won&#39;t tell me is why she does it.  She <br/>
showed me the marks on her wrist and they are very fine lines. <br/>
<br/>
 Our first conversation did not go great but it was productive.  The <br/>
next day I was able to tell her how much I love her and that I would <br/>
love her even if she was covered in marks.  I told her i would love <br/>
her even if she was a reaver which is a dorky sci fi reference from <br/>
a show we both love.  She said but if she was a reaver she would <br/>
want to eat me.  I told her I would love her even if she ate me and <br/>
used my skin for clothes.  Then she laughed and said that was gross <br/>
but I got my point across.  Liz has always been the kind of kid that <br/>
did not see how much she was loved.  She has a good group of women <br/>
role models that really love her and listen to her and understand <br/>
her.  The piece she is missing is a good male adult in her life.  <br/>
That&#39;s just the way it happened.  Her dad wasn&#39;t around.  My dad <br/>
argued with both my sister and I and hasn&#39;t seen his granddaughters <br/>
in several years.  Maybe that has something to do with it maybe <br/>
not.  <br/>
<br/>
This weekend I touched on something she said during our first <br/>
conversation.  She felt that I didn&#39;t help her do what she wanted to <br/>
do but only those things that I wanted for her or that I thought she <br/>
SHOULD want.  I don&#39;t really think I do this but I can understand <br/>
that is how she sees it right now.  The thing she want most is to <br/>
start a full time ealy education program at a nearby college.  She <br/>
does not want to get her GED or take community college classes.  I <br/>
looked up the admission requirements and wrote them all down for her <br/>
and I looked into how to register for the SAT.  The thing she needs <br/>
to get done is a portfolio and I think it&#39;s freaking her out a <br/>
little.  We talked about some ways for her to do it.  <br/>
<br/>
Right now I understand I may or may not be able to make things <br/>
better for her but I sure could make them worse.  Mostly I know this <br/>
is not about me.  She&#39;s not cutting to hurt me and I need to not <br/>
take it as a personal insult as a mom.  I love her even when she <br/>
doesn&#39;t believe it.  I am doing my best to help her even when she <br/>
doesn&#39;t see it.  She feels that the only thing accomplished by my <br/>
knowing is that I feel bad about it.  Just maybe though she will see <br/>
that even if I freak out a little I can be trusted to deal with <br/>
knowing things about her.  This is something that will probably be <br/>
an ongoing struggle for me for awhile.  Thank you all for helping me.<br/>

You said: Liz has always been the kind of kid that did not see how much she<br/>

<br/>
Since your daughter is having a hard time seeing your love for her, maybe it<br/>
would help you two to check out the Five Love Languages series of books. It<br/>
just might be that the things which make her feel loved (which languages she<br/>
needs to hear) are not things you are doing yet, but things you could be<br/>
doing for her.<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought. Glad things are looking up for you and your daughter.<br/>

This part of what was written struck me.  I can&#39;t remember who said it, but someone, somewhere on this list or another one, said that it doesn&#39;t really matter how *we* see our kids&#39; experience, it matters how *they* see it and feel about it(totally paraphrased).  It&#39;s great when *we* think we help our kids get what they want, but what really matters is if *they* feel we are really helping them get what they want, that we&#39;re in their corner, have their back.  For some reason she is experiencing it as you not helping her get/do what she wants  Perhaps that bears further examination?  One thing I feel is so stellar about radical unschooling is the opportunity for me as a parent to really examine everything.  To really go deeper, and stretch, and examine thoroughly every nook and cranny of my motives, my feelings, my responses, etc.  I see this as a great opportunity for some more examination :).<br/>

she visited there for Take your Daughter to Work Day a few years <br/>
ago.  She got matched with the director of the program and got to <br/>
visit the day care as well as sit in on a couple of classes.  She <br/>
also knows some kids who go to the community college because they <br/>
dropped out so she has a negative idea like it&#39;s not as good.  Maybe <br/>
if she visited specifically to check out the early childhood program <br/>
she would see it&#39;s a good place to start out.  Thanks for the idea.<br/>

Why does it piss you off? Do you feel like you&#39;ve done so much that is good and wonderful that she is somehow taking that away from you by self-harming? It&#39;s a hard thing when you feel like you&#39;ve done so much to make someone else&#39;s life better and it still isn&#39;t good enough. Unfortunately it&#39;s worse than useless to get angry at someone not appreciating what you&#39;ve done.  When your daughter is feeling bad enough to cut herself it isn&#39;t<br/>
because you have done good things and she isn&#39;t grateful, it&#39;s because<br/>
she feels bad. Making her accountable for all the good things that<br/>
you&#39;ve done aren&#39;t going to help her feel better. In fact it will just<br/>
add to her burden. Much better if you can see how much better your life is for what you&#39;ve done, how much more you enjoy being with your daughter and having favorite sci-fi shows to reference. Think about it as a gift, not one that you get to hold  her accountable to, just a gift.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday we were in town walking from the library to a toy store and Linnaea said she was bored and I wish instead of saying &quot;How could you be bored, we are just walking through town?&quot; judging her expectation of entertainment as too high, I&#39;d said &quot;let&#39;s race&quot; or invited her to bunny hop with me or something. We did shoot people with imaginary laser guns, though. Her boredom wasn&#39;t mine to judge. She expressed a need and I could have helped to fulfill it. I felt hurt that she was bored. We had gone to town and were looking for games that she and Simon wanted and we&#39;d just played a fantastic game of laser tag. It felt like she was dissing all of that for her boredom. But that was all me. I was feeling like I should be praised for all that I did or made possible or whatever. She had a good time doing those things but, in those 10 minutes of walking across the centre of town, she wanted something engaging then. I regret that I didn&#39;t play right away. It<br/>
 won&#39;t happen next time. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-337174861">I agree that it&#39;s a mistake to think of boredom as ingratitude.  One might<br/>
be having so much fun and just wants to continue ... but being no longer a<br/>
little kid and feeling one &quot;has to&quot; be mature and leave when others are<br/>
ready to move on.  So.  It isn&#39;t *at all* that a child is bored because<br/>
something wasn&#39;t good enough.  The ordinary or mundane looks unappealing by<br/>
comparison not comfortable.  I remember that a lot more when I was younger.<br/>
I feel it sometimes as an adult but not near as much as I did when I was a<br/>
kid.  I&#39;m more settled in my life now than I was as a teen when I had no<br/>
idea what I should be doing next.  The pressure to succeed somehow in adult<br/>
life or to identify with adulthood sooner than one is ready is a thought<br/>
that&#39;s embedded early in school and that thought only gets more worrisome as<br/>
time goes on.  It&#39;s only after a few milestones one feels adds up to adult<br/>
status have been passed that things might begin to feel more comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
About cutting.  A lot of kids feel so much disconnection that it&#39;s hard to<br/>
find a way to heal it.  And attributing the problem to a lack of gratitude<br/>
underestimates the level of difficulty.  Some adults may think that a kid&#39;s<br/>
life must be so much easier than adult life.  I think now that the kid is<br/>
older it makes a lot more sense to shift into friendship and do things to<br/>
show openness and sensitivity that stretch the parent in new ways and allow<br/>
the relationship to mature.  Of course, that&#39;s much easier said than done<br/>
for most people.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-170877149">I know I am totally new here and therefore I hope you will afford me a<br/>
little patience in jumping into this topic. <br/>
<br/>
When I was about 13, I started cutting. I came from a background that<br/>
I am sure is absolutely alien to you, but I want to give it to you in<br/>
hopes that it may give you some insight to exactly what is the root<br/>
cause of your daughter&#39;s desire to hurt herself. <br/>
<br/>
My mother was a drug addict and I had been abused by my mother&#39;s drug<br/>
friends for an extended period of time. I was afraid to seek help, as<br/>
it had gone on so long, we (meaning people in general) tend to suffer<br/>
in silence on those things we have become accustomed to for fear that<br/>
the unknown will often be worse and uncontrollable. Over a period of<br/>
time, suppressing emotions and feelings to hide the turmoil took it&#39;s<br/>
toll. I started to feel numb inside, trapped in a void of non-emotion<br/>
and mentally I began to break down. I started cutting myself just<br/>
because I needed to see the blood to root myself, to feel as though I<br/>
was still alive. The pain made me feel human...if that makes sense at all.<br/>
<br/>
Cutters, in my personal experience and by association, are those who<br/>
have an enormous build up of emotion that they&#39;ve separated themselves<br/>
with for one reason or another that is about to come uncorked...often<br/>
violently. They use this method to try to ground themselves, to<br/>
re-bury what is bothering them so deeply. I quit cutting when I<br/>
determined that people were onto me. I was fearful of what it would<br/>
mean if I had to explain myself and moved on to further destructive<br/>
methods instead. <br/>
<br/>
I know your first thought is to be angry at your daughter for not<br/>
sharing her deeper emotions with you...and it&#39;s natural that you<br/>
would! Your teen daughter is dealing with something really deep to her<br/>
as well as a strong desire to be independent from mom while still<br/>
needing her desperately...that&#39;s very conflicting and confusing to<br/>
her. Finding a way to bring balance to that and encourage her to let<br/>
you in is your biggest challenge now but will reap the max in<br/>
benefits. Either you or a trusted friend will need to really let the<br/>
momma barrier down and get her to open up to you...not as<br/>
mother/daughter but as trusted and loved friend. If you can do<br/>
that...then you&#39;ll reach the true root of what&#39;s causing her to act<br/>
out this way. <br/>
<br/>
I hope what I wrote makes sense and is received in love as I only<br/>
intended it to be written that way. <br/>
<br/>
Best wishes to you and to your daughter. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh yeah my initial feeling was that it was all about me and I was <br/>
mad.  I got over it pretty quick but still it&#39;s how I felt.  I don&#39;t <br/>
beat myself up that I felt that way but I do wish I hadn&#39;t talked to <br/>
her when I felt that way.  It didn&#39;t accomplish anything and it made <br/>
us both feel bad.  I apologized and I will do better next time.  <br/>
<br/>
Even in the heat of the moment we were both clear on the fact that <br/>
how I was reacting was my problem that I needed to work out for <br/>
myself.  I can be a support to her if she wants me to in dealing <br/>
with her feelings but she can&#39;t support me in dealing with mine and <br/>
I don&#39;t expect her to.  The only thing I can do is be as trustworthy <br/>
and loving as I can be so she will feel safe to come to me.  I don&#39;t <br/>
even really care if she doesn&#39;t come to me as long as she feels she <br/>
has somebody.  She and my sister are very close so maybe she&#39;ll talk <br/>
to her.  <br/>
