forwarded message - <br/>
<br/>
I just thought I would pass this along on here in case anyone wants to<br/>
go to<br/>
Change.org to vote for Naomi&#39;s recommendation. It is about supporting<br/>
mothers so that they are able to stay home to rasie their children instead<br/>
of being forced to put them in daycare. <br/>

<br/>
(from Caren: just click the 56 vote on the left side of the page, and<br/>
you&#39;ll be prompted to register. When you get your confirmation, you&#39;ll<br/>
need to click to vote again, but it&#39;s quick and painless!)<br/>
<br/>
Here is what her e-mail said:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1) The opportunity is urgent as now is the deadline (the 31st at<br/>
midnight):<br/>
If you would like to make your voice heard with the new president, please<br/>
vote on my parenting recommendation and on my other posts at<br/>
change.org. You<br/>
will have to sign up but you will not get emails as a result of it and<br/>
it is<br/>
easy and quick. If we get enough votes by Wednesday midnight, it will be<br/>
seen by Obama&#39;s management. It takes a couple of thousands votes so it<br/>
will<br/>
take a miracle to get enough votes since I just created it but there are<br/>
many thousands of us so it is possible. Feel free to pass it on.<br/>
