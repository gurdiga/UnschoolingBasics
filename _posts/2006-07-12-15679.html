These are definitely not unschooling issues. These are life issues.<br/>
This list is to help people move towards unschooling, but we can&#39;t<br/>
solve every problem or be counselors to people.<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t help organize a life. We can give tips about how unschooling<br/>
can help us release anxiety, about trusting your kids can learn<br/>
without school and fun things to do with your children. We can give<br/>
tips on how to quit focusing on the lack and instead choose to focus<br/>
on abundance. But it sounds like you have a lot of life issues that<br/>
need to be dealt with before unschooling can unfold in your lives.<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t be everything. It&#39;s just an unschooling list.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1074403841">~my oldest has to<br/>
be threatened with grounding from the xbox and mo-ped to get him to<br/>
bathe. :)~<br/>
<br/>
How about this...<br/>
quit threatening anyone. Let him choose when to bathe or not, say<br/>
nothing for now. Cook them food they enjoy, forget about lifepac or<br/>
homework or ANYTHING school related. Focus on doing the things with<br/>
them, that bring you all joy.<br/>
Do this for a week and see if your stress level goes down. I bet it will.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ren&#39;s right, but.... I do think people here have given so much  <br/>
conscious thought to living a happy, peaceful life, that it makes  <br/>
sense that someone would want to ask here when they&#39;re having trouble.<br/>
<br/>
I think we can offer some ideas --<br/>
<br/>
--- sounds like some pretty serious depression/anxiety and many of us  <br/>
have experienced that. As unschoolers, it is critical that parents  <br/>
have positive outlooks on life - I don&#39;t believe unschooling is a  <br/>
good idea for families with parents who are depressed/anxious. So,  <br/>
the writer seems to know that it is important to take care of herself  <br/>
- but when in the midst of depression, it is very hard to know what  <br/>
to do about it. If you have medical coverage of ANY kind, see your  <br/>
doctor, please. Very often they&#39;ll help you figure out some concrete  <br/>
things you can really do and just a few small things can make a huge  <br/>
difference. They might give you some anti-depressant medication -  <br/>
again, just a bit of that for a short time can turn your life around,  <br/>
get you on a different, positive, path. In the meantime, try St.  <br/>
John&#39;s Wort -- I am NOT a believer in homeopathy or most herbs - a  <br/>
total skeptic - but St. John&#39;s Wort has enough clinical evidence  <br/>
behind it to satisfy even me. It won&#39;t hurt; it can be very very  <br/>
helpful for mild to moderate depression. Combine that with some  <br/>
exercise - don&#39;t be too ambitious - just go for a 20 minutes walk  <br/>
once a day. That can also do wonders! If you&#39;re not sleeping well,  <br/>
please be sure to tell your doctor that, too, because it is very  <br/>
difficult to dig yourself out of depression and anxiety if you&#39;re not  <br/>
sleeping. You can get help for that, too.<br/>
