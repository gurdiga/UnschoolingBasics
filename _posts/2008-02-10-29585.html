Did anybody but you care about the button being pushed? And isn&#39;t that just too close to pushing your buttons? :)<br/>

 <br/>
Yesterday a situation came up with my oldest that has me concerned. I<br/>
am not sure what he&#39;s thinking.<br/>
<br/>
We went to the bank to get money deposited, etc. DS has a check every<br/>
month for him to spend money on. He pays rent and has money left for<br/>
what he wants. It is quite some change. At the bank I reminded him<br/>
of the rent and the money he owed for the toy I got for him because he<br/>
could not wait. (Lego Mars Mission set) He was upset (I would be too<br/>
if I didn&#39;t understand how money shrinks), but he paid the amounts<br/>
needed. He went over to the back of the room and played with the table<br/>
set toys for kids. I was ready to go because one twin was hungry and<br/>
wanted to eat. A gentle reminder to all... then I was left waiting at<br/>
the door with one twin. I went back again to remind him and the other<br/>
twin, but DS stayed while the rest of us stood at the door. We<br/>
FINALLY got to the van but DS lagged back, pushing at the handicapped<br/>
door button. I went back once again but he refused to look at me or<br/>
stop pushing at the button. I had to push him away gently to look at<br/>
me (remember we depend on eye contact to sign and communicate) and get<br/>
him to stop pushing the button. He kept coming back at it before<br/>
running to the van. I explained when he finally looked at me that<br/>
the button is for people who are in a wheelchair or have crutches. If<br/>
kids play with it all the time they might take out that button or put<br/>
up an ugly sign that says Parents, please do not allow your children<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1443828538">Wait what?  I must have missed this.  Your son pays rent? Why?  <br/>
<br/>
Second, it sounds to me like your son was very upset that he had to<br/>
leave.  Did you try and acknowledge his feelings about leaving?  I see<br/>
that you sign, but did you try to effectively communicate to him that<br/>
you understood upwhy he was set, and try and reach some sort of<br/>
solution.  Sometimes, when my kids are upset about leaving, all I have<br/>
to do is acknowledge their feelings and empathize with them (gee I<br/>
know this really sucks, maybe next time we can stay longer).<br/>

<br/>
Wow.<br/>
Kids shouldn&#39;t have to pay rent in my opinion. Ever. I think that is a<br/>
parents responsibility. Sure, share all the information about where<br/>
the money goes if he&#39;s interested in being included in that. Great.<br/>
But paying rent? <br/>
No. Parents should be responsible for providing the necessities for<br/>
their children. That&#39;s part of being a parent. I don&#39;t think making a<br/>
child pay rent is a healthy way to foster trust. He lives in your<br/>
home, you chose to have him, you chose to provide everything he needs<br/>
by choosing to have a child.<br/>
<br/>
And he&#39;s 8!! I don&#39;t even make my 18 year old pay rent. I can&#39;t<br/>
imagine a child having that kind of adult responsibility foisted upon<br/>
him. What happened to having a carefree childhood?<br/>

<br/>
As I read through your money arrangements with your child, I keep<br/>
thinking about how I&#39;d feel if my dh treated me the way you&#39;re<br/>
treating your child. I would be PISSED. It&#39;s disrespectful.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously a parent/child relationship is very different from a<br/>
parenting partnership, but all I have to do in order to see whether<br/>
something is respectful is ask myself how I&#39;d feel if dh and I did<br/>
that to each other. Makes a lot of treatment to children look very<br/>
different.<br/>
<br/>
When my dh was the sole breadwinner, he didn&#39;t give me an allowance<br/>
and have me pay rent or any other such thing. He provided what he could.<br/>
My money, our home, our food etc.. is for everyone in the family.<br/>
Whether you have any sort of income or not, you are provided for. We<br/>
share our resources.<br/>
<br/>
The money your eight year old is being given, should be his to choose<br/>
how to use or it isn&#39;t really his. If he&#39;s being made to pay rent,<br/>
that is decided by the parents and it really isn&#39;t a choice at all.<br/>
The amount is decided by the adults, the fact that he has to use his<br/>
money that way is decided by adults. If you give him money, it should<br/>
be truly HIS in my opinion. Anything you decided about how it&#39;s used,<br/>
makes it NOT his at all. So keep that portion and quite pretending<br/>
it&#39;s his. Because it isn&#39;t.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think your situation is (like mine) very different than the norm. Are you<br/>
talking about his SSI check?<br/>
I&#39;ve received Social Security Survivors Benefits since my husband&#39;s death.<br/>
This means every month, I get a stipend for me and one for each child.<br/>
Basically, this means the kid(s) get a check in their name. My kids were<br/>
initially confused as to why I couldn&#39;t hand over the entire thing to them;<br/>
I explained that it really comes out as *child support* and it&#39;s intended to<br/>
Support their whole Lives. I also made it clear that just as I get *paid*<br/>
just for being their mom, they get paid just for being kids (allowance,<br/>
though I think stipend is a better term). I&#39;ve made a point (even, maybe<br/>
especially, when it&#39;s a struggle) to be VERY generous with their pocket<br/>
money.<br/>
It&#39;s much easier for Hayden and I, as he gets older and has a better<br/>
understanding of the day-to-day financial flow of our lives.<br/>
The situation described above sounds like a different take on what I&#39;m<br/>
doing. It&#39;s not a &quot;collect cans to pay your rent&quot; kind of situation :D<br/>

into *his* account. Oh My! How cool must that be for a kid, to have a FAT<br/>
(definitely in their perspective) check deposited every single month :D If<br/>
it were tomorrow, that means we&#39;d have to have a talk about *family cash<br/>
flow* and his contribution to such. He&#39;d probably think it was a real treat<br/>
to pay his *bills* every month, especially if it meant an ATM card or actual<br/>
paper check to sign :D I&#39;d even play along and get a receipt book ;)<br/>
He&#39;s already talked about depositing his allowance into a checking account,<br/>
so he can pay his WoW and Runescape fees independently.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;d be angry too if my husband treated me this way, but the checks are<br/>
in my sons&#39; names.  They are, in a complicated way, child support from<br/>
my husband.  In the past I kept the checks but felt it wasn&#39;t fair<br/>
because their names are on them, so they get them.  I did not mention<br/>
this because I didn&#39;t want to completely open our finances to the<br/>
list.  Cat&#39;s out the bag now. :)<br/>
<br/>
Because I give this disposable income to the children instead of<br/>
keeping it, it also means I ask for extra support elsewhere to make it<br/>
to the end of the month.  So the &quot;rent&quot; helps in that aspect.  I am<br/>
still thinking over our options on it.<br/>
<br/>
But I do understand DS&#39;s anger at having money fly out of his hands -<br/>
he got upset at Radio Shack recently because the $20 pinball machine<br/>
he was choosing to buy himself took the last of his money.  He asked<br/>
to go to there and I supported him in his request.  DS was saying it&#39;s<br/>
amazing how a itty-bitty thing like a Nintendogs DS game cartridge<br/>
costs more new than the pinball machine.  The wheels in his head are<br/>
turning now. :)<br/>
<br/>
When you mention a &quot;care-free childhood,&quot; what do you picture?  For<br/>
me, I want my children to be well aware of how the world works, to be<br/>
involved with the running of a household and the tasks needed for it.<br/>
I don&#39;t want them to view adult life as mysterious and some mythical<br/>
threshhold that they will reach, then get smacked down or forever feel<br/>
like they&#39;re just playing at being adults.  I don&#39;t mean throw the<br/>
ugliness of the world at them, I mean have them aware of the<br/>
responsibilities and situations that come with living.<br/>
<br/>
I understand that it wouldn&#39;t be a good idea to extract &quot;rent&quot; from<br/>
the boys because they didn&#39;t choose the place we live in right now.<br/>
One option could be that we together as a family choose the next place<br/>
we live and discuss the contribution each of us could give to the new<br/>
place.  Or we could settle on an &quot;allowance&quot; amount paid out by check<br/>
or cash every week via &quot;bank box&quot; in the house so I wouldn&#39;t be the<br/>
direct one to blame.  (For the twins at this point it&#39;s the mailbox<br/>
where their checks are yet to arrive. Ha.)  There&#39;s lots more ideas...<br/>

Hi John --<br/>

It&#39;s good to have this input but it still isn&#39;t clear to me why this is an issue.<br/>
<br/>
Does the check actually come made out in the boys&#39; name each month? Or does it come made out to the parent, to be used for child support?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-678359497">When I first pulled our kids out of school, I wanted them to understand our finances.  My mom had never included my brother in I in the task of family finances.  I firmly believe in letting our kids know how much we pay out in bills and how much is left for fun.  So, I got 2 extra registers and printed some &quot;checks&quot;  out for them to use.  Whenever dh got paid we went to the bank made our deposit, then went home to write out the bills.  Jordan and Skylor recorded everything I did in their registers, they wrote out checks for all the same bills in the same amounts.  When we were done, they knew exactly how much was left for fun stuff.  This way they understand when I would have to say,we only have the money for so&so.  They knew I wasn&#39;t lying and knew when the extra money was there I would gladly spend it on them.  <br/>

There&#39;s really no such thing as a &quot;care-free&quot; childhood, but I do<br/>
think kids should ideally be free from adult responsibility until such<br/>
time as they WANT it. Which they do, each in their own way and time.<br/>
Just like everything else. I don&#39;t think providing themselves with<br/>
housing is something they should need to do until they want to. In<br/>
essence, your child is being made to be responsible for something he<br/>
doesn&#39;t want to be responsible for. <br/>
<br/>
The checks aren&#39;t truly for him alone. Whether they&#39;re in his name or<br/>

Both names are on those checks.  It is my understanding that those<br/>
checks are intended for you, to aid you financially in the raising of<br/>
your children.  I think each child gets a separate check because this<br/>
is the amount allotted to you for that particular child.  I do not<br/>
think this is for ease of banking.  I think that is for ease of their<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-419174912">***No, he pays a portion of the rent scaled down to his income. I<br/>
thought it would help him understand a little of how things work with<br/>
my own money as well.***<br/>
<br/>
We write here sometimes about parents being their child&#39;s partner.  What we mean by that is parents who&#39;ve been alive longer and have more experience and more ideas about how to solve problems, etc., should be helping their kids do what they want and get what they want.   We don&#39;t mean a child should be a parents partner in managing adult responsibilities. <br/>
<br/>
Making a child pay rent, making a little child feel responsible for what should be his parents responsibilities comes uncomfortably close to emotional incest.  A parent who makes a child feel that he is a partner in the responsibility of feeding and housing a family is making a terrible, terrible mistake. It&#39;s unhealthy.  Stop it.<br/>
<br/>
If the checks are intended for the kids to use, give them the checks.  If the checks are intended for their care, cash the checks and use the portion you need and give them what&#39;s left for spending money.  Tell them something like, &quot;This is from the money your Dad sends to help take care of us.&quot; and let that be it  <br/>
<br/>
Everyone has to find a way to live with what they have.  Whether you have a one income family, SS checks, whether you&#39;re on Welfare, whether both parents work EVERYONE has to find a way to live with the money they have.  Limited income is not an excuse for the emotional abuse of children.   <br/>
