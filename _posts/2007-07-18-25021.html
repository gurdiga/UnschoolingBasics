<div id="ygrps-yiv-124715830">What a great thread this is! Thanks to all of you who&#39;ve responded with your<br/>
cumulative years of experience:-)  The point about allowing a child to grow<br/>
in their trust of their own intuition and inner guidance cannot be repeated<br/>
often enough, IMO. It can be so difficult to keep that idea at the forefront<br/>
of our consciousness, where it belongs, when 25 things are happening at<br/>
once. My almost 4 yr old daughter rarely has temper tantrums (whining is<br/>
another matter LOL!), but she had her worst ever just last Saturday, and it<br/>
was because she was made to do something she really didn&#39;t want to do. I try<br/>
to avoid this kind of thing, and will generally rearrange my whole schedule<br/>
to accommodate her whenever I can. Last Saturday was an exception to that.<br/>
She was miserable and screamed and cried (long story short, we&#39;ve had a<br/>
visitor from France for 2.5 weeks - 15 yr old here to strengthen her English<br/>
language skills - and we had agreed to take her on a shopping trip to a<br/>
local mall. This was the ONLY window to do it in, Lila did NOT want to go,<br/>
but there was absolutely no one who could stay with her. Ugh.)  She finally<br/>
fell asleep, and slept through the whole shopping trip. Best thing she could<br/>
do, probably. Anyway, we had plans to tour the statue of liberty the next<br/>
day. Lila, her baby sister, her uncle, her dad, our guest, and me, were all<br/>
planning on going. Lila woke up and didn&#39;t want to go. Without missing a<br/>
beat, my husband and I said, almost in unison, that of course she didn&#39;t<br/>
have to go if she didn&#39;t want to. Her dad or I would stay home with her. She<br/>
picked her dad. The rest of us went, and the trip just emphasized for me<br/>
that I should always trust Lila&#39;s intuition (except of course, in those<br/>
&quot;life/death situations); she would have had a miserable time. Each leg of<br/>
the trip had things about it that Lila really doesn&#39;t like. I&#39;ve never been<br/>
there before, so I had no idea what to expect, but Lila was adamant that<br/>
morning; not &quot;I don&#39;t want to go,&quot; it was simply &quot;No, I&#39;m not going.&quot; She<br/>
had the best day with her dad, and she clearly felt respected and honored -<br/>
she even thanked me for going without her, because she knew how much I&#39;d<br/>
miss her! This has happened repeatedly throughout her short life; she has a<br/>
feeling about something, and whether I recognize why she feels that way or<br/>
not, it invariably turns out to be spot on. Kids are so uncluttered by<br/>
garbage and skewed perspectives, I think we&#39;d be crazy to ignore their<br/>
intuition and turn them against themselves, which is, in effect, what we do<br/>
when we undermine their choices.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for all everyone has had to offer on this subject.<br/>

I find that this sort of situation is *most* likely to happen with <br/>
Mo when there&#39;s been a stretch of time when I&#39;ve coaxed her to do <br/>
several things she doesn&#39;t really want to do. Most of the time she&#39;s <br/>
able to be really accomodating and brainstorms ways that she can <br/>
have a good time, too, suggests toys to bring, etc. Its really <br/>
charming, but then again I try *not* to tax her good nature too <br/>
often. <br/>
