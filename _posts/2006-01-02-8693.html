<div id="ygrps-yiv-1385449774">Hello! I&#39;d like to introduce myself, and ask a couple of questions. <br/>
<br/>
I am a new unschooler with 3 kids, 2 of which are at home. My oldest<br/>
(boy) is 13 and has no desire to leave PS at this time. My 11 yo<br/>
daughter (who really inspired my journey to unschooling) attends PS in<br/>
the morning for band, computer class, and lunch before coming home,<br/>
and I recently decided to pull my 9 yo daughter out of PS in favor of<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
To give a brief (OK maybe not so brief ;) ) background, my 11 yo never<br/>
fit into the PS system- she is a free spirit, an artist, and a lover<br/>
of nature. She was diagnosed with ADD at a young age, and while<br/>
everyone agreed that she is highly intelligent, she just wasn&#39;t<br/>
keeping up with the &quot;standards&quot;. (In other words, she just didn&#39;t pay<br/>
attention and thus missed all of the information being taught.) So,<br/>
after watching her struggle for the last 2 years of elementary school,<br/>
I decided that middle school would only make things worse, and started<br/>
thinking of ways that I could reach her in a way that makes sense to<br/>
her creative mind. She has so many interests that it is easy to<br/>
accomodate her- she plays the flute at PS, takes art lessons, watches<br/>
the Food Network to learn all about her newest passion for cooking,<br/>
and we have annual passes to SeaWorld so that she may visit her<br/>
beloved dolphins whenever she likes. :)  <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t start with unschooling- I thought that I would just &quot;teach&quot;<br/>
her more creatively, and that the one-on-one time would help with her<br/>
attention issues. It wasn&#39;t until my youngest, a &quot;school&quot; type child,<br/>
(please forgive me for stereotyping) started complaining about school<br/>
that I started thinking about how much I hated the whole idea of<br/>
&quot;standards&quot;- PERIOD. Here in Florida we have the dreaded FCAT- and if<br/>
you don&#39;t pass it in 3rd grade, you don&#39;t pass 3rd grade. Now, my<br/>
youngest daughter is a detail oriented, perfectionistic,<br/>
much-too-worried-about-everything kid, and guess what happened? When<br/>
she started having a little trouble in math, she went into hysterics.<br/>
She had herself so convinced that she wasn&#39;t good at math that she<br/>
literally quit trying. Of course, when you have FCATs in February,<br/>
teachers can&#39;t stop for questions- they have to keep moving. So, the<br/>
vicious cycle bagan. And ended. Once I started reading about<br/>
unschooling, I knew what I had to do. I pulled her out just 2 months<br/>
after school began, and she was thrilled.<br/>
<br/>
Now for the questions. What do you do with a child who doesn&#39;t really<br/>
show an interest in anything at all? I was so happy to be able to<br/>
provide my other daughter with her creative outlets- but I just can&#39;t<br/>
seem to get my youngest interested in anything. (OK, maybe shopping!<br/>
;) ) We do play games and she had a brief interest in Egyptology, but<br/>
other than that she doesn&#39;t have any obvious passions. I should say<br/>
that even my son has obvious interests, so I&#39;m really perplexed with<br/>
this. If anyone has any suggestions on how to draw out the more subtle<br/>
interests in their children, I&#39;d greatly appreciate any help that I<br/>
can get. I so want all of my kids to be happy, and I don&#39;t feel that<br/>
energy coming from her at all. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry for the rather long introduction- I really didn&#39;t intend for<br/>
it to be that way! Thanks in advance to anyone who has advice- I am<br/>
truly enjoying this website!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1601822232">Kristin!<br/>
<br/>
Welcome!  I am new to hsing and unschooling, too, and know it is THE way for me and my family.  I want to first say that your children are SO fortunate to have a mother with the insight to remove them from a system that is not a good fit for their learning style.  As a former substitute teacher, I remember meeting so many young people like your 11 yr old.  They would be in resource classes but would be VERY gifted.  I did my best to convey to these students to hold onto their passions and pursue them fast and furiously after getting out of the system.  And the same game goes for you 9 yr old.  So many children are being lost by the way side because of the goals of the school systems.<br/>
<br/>
As for your youngest, I have heard that children who have been in school need time to deschool and decompress.  To get back in touch with their natural learning desires.  My ds is 5 yrs old.  I started hsing with pretty much doing unschooling but with a bit of structure.  As I learned more about unschooling and began applying it to all areas of our lives, I too felt in limbo.  All my son did was sit around and watch TV.  I read in a book called The Unschooling Handbook that many children will kind of veg out for a while.  In a way it is a test to see if parents are really serious about unschooling.  Over time though, I have sat and listened to him talk.  He has a passion for wolves so much of our discussion and many of our activities revolve around wolves.  He loves it and learning is fun for the both of us.  I tell him often that I never really thought much of wolves, but because of all the reading and vids that we have watched about wolves, I am now in love with wolves myself.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing I have done is to not focus on determining his interests as much as going about my day and doing things that interests me.  Usually, my children will follow along and jump in or eventually venture off and do their own thing.  As a result, discussions pop up about what I am doing or they will ask me to read a book (I have another ds who is 2.5 yrs old going on 25 yrs old!  LOL!) which will lead to us delving into a subject more indepthly.<br/>
<br/>
Other things I do with my children are things that I wanted to do as a child that I never did or did not do enough of.  When they see that I am excited, then they get excited, too.  I also change the environment around so that they can see what options are available if they so choose with respect to books, puzzles, etc.  We also play quite a few computer games together.  Carmen Sandiego is our favorite.  We solve the mysteries together and I am now a Carmen Sandiego addict.  I am often in shock about how much I get into my children&#39;s activities.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, something that I think calls for an adjustment in our thought processes is realizing that unschooling is really about living life.  It is not really a method of learning it is a lifestyle.  So, just doing normal things such as cooking, cleaning, running errands, speaking to the neighbors all count as unschooling things because my children get to see how things operate in the real world and won&#39;t be in shock once they get out of hs.  I know schooled kids get real world experience, too, but often times I think that my ds1 would miss out on certain things if he was in school such as grocery shopping.<br/>
<br/>
I offer all of this not as advice but as my experience and what is working for my family.  Best wishes with your wonderful children.<br/>
<br/>
Peace<br/>
Tyra<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1493541387">Hi Kristin...<br/>
<br/>
Welcome. I hope you stick around. This is a great place and you&#39;ll <br/>
find lots of advice and wisdom here (at least I do!)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also in Florida (Ocala to be exact). You mentioned the FCAT. Do <br/>
you still homeschool through the state? If so you may want to check <br/>
out <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.AlternativeEducationInstitute.org">http://www.AlternativeEducationInstitute.org</a><br/>
I&#39;m not sure if you know but in Florida we have the option of hs&#39;ing <br/>
through a 600/umbrella/non public school. Those who do are no longer <br/>
obligated to answer to the state, instead we answer to the &quot;school&quot;. <br/>
The only legal requirement you&#39;ll have is to submit a list of 180 <br/>
dates (you choose which dates) which represent 180 days of &quot;school&quot;. <br/>
That&#39;s it. Your daughter will not be able to use the public school <br/>
system for classes though. For us it doesn&#39;t matter but it may be a <br/>
consideration for you. I just figured I&#39;d throw that out there <br/>
because I wasn&#39;t aware of that option when I started last year. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thank you, Tyra! I truly appreciate your experiences- it is so nice to<br/>
 hear from others who are going through the same thing!<br/>
<br/>
When I decided to homeschool my oldest daughter, it was like a ton of<br/>
bricks had been lifted from my chest- I knew that she would finally be<br/>
able to be herself. I have so enjoyed having her home and watching her<br/>
creativity flourish! <br/>
<br/>
I think that your comment about decompressing makes sense here- my<br/>
youngest has only been home for a couple of months, and she wasn&#39;t as<br/>
prepared as my older daughter, who knew for six months that she would<br/>
be homeschooled after the 5th grade. My youngest had about 2 weeks<br/>
notice, and school wasn&#39;t a very happy place for her when we left, so<br/>
I suppose that I shouldn&#39;t be alarmed by her need to just chill.<br/>
<br/>
I also still need to let go of my own schooly fears- I can&#39;t wait<br/>
until the day when those are gone!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you again for sharing- I love to read books about unschooling,<br/>
but sometimes I just need to hear from someone on the front lines. :) <br/>
<br/>
Have a great day!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1547583513">Kristin & Tyra:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to unschooling also, well since April 05&#39;.  My 11 yo dd is <br/>
still deschooling, but I am beginning to see some major interests.<br/>
<br/>
My dd loves neopets, designing fairies on pro shop paint, music, her <br/>
PS2 and playing with puzzle/mind teasers in booklets.  I have 10 <br/>
different kinds of these booklets and I rotate them on our coffee <br/>
table through out the year.  Some are really a challenge while <br/>
others are easy for her.<br/>
<br/>
After 6 years of playing the piano, she decided to stop taking <br/>
lessons in September.  But once in awhile I&#39;ll here her playing a <br/>
song.  I play a little, but have always wanted to learn the guitar.  <br/>
So yesterday I ordered a guitar from ebay with free lessons on-<br/>
line.  I have taken up crocheting and learning to play the wooden <br/>
flute.<br/>
<br/>
My dd is watching all of this with some interest.  She has begun to <br/>
try and teach herself to crochet, she doesn&#39;t want me to teach her, <br/>
she wants to do it herself from the book.<br/>
<br/>
The reason I&#39;m sharing this;  I found that I need to find interest.  <br/>
Before this I worked full time as an RN and was too tired to do <br/>
anything but crash when I got home.  <br/>
<br/>
The kids need to deschooling but in the mean time start learning <br/>
something that you are interested in and maybe they will become <br/>
interested too.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also on neopets with her, play PS2 even though I stink at both <br/>
she likes talking about it with me.<br/>
