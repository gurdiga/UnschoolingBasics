<div id="ygrps-yiv-340176495">Need your help!  My 8 y.o. suddenly gets angry and calls 10 y.o. sister and I names and sticks her tongue out at us when everything was going fine.  Not sure what the &quot;correct&quot; response is.  I tried ignoring it and then changing subject when she&#39;s calmed down but lately I&#39;m wondering if I&#39;m encouraging the behavior by not getting mad as I would with anyone else and telling her I don&#39;t like it and getting angry with her, which is what I feel like doing.  A friend who also unschools ignores the &quot;bad&quot; words and behavior like this as she feels it&#39;s just the kid getting out his/her  frustration and it will pass.  Advice?  And, no, I can&#39;t seem to &quot;head it off at the pass&quot; by watching for clues she&#39;s going to blow! :(<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1343097489">Thanks, Verna.  When I try to address it, she gets angrier and throws things or yells louder and I feel I&#39;ve made a mistake helping her.  When I ask her about it when she&#39;s calm, she says she doesn&#39;t know what she wants.  <br/>
<br/>
What about the name calling?  Would you address this or leave it be and focus on empathizing with her?<br/>

**************************<br/>
<br/>
Can you talk about how you feel without getting mad per se? I don&#39;t <br/>
mean to put on a happy face while saying &quot;that hurts my feelings&quot; I <br/>
mean is there an honest response that you can share with her without <br/>
yelling or scolding? Other people&#39;s reactions are important <br/>
information about the world - it may be that your dd is looking to <br/>
elicit some reactions as a way of learning about people and social <br/>
situations.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; A friend who also unschools ignores the &quot;bad&quot; words and behavior <br/>
 </span></blockquote>like this as she feels it&#39;s just the kid getting out his/her  <br/>
frustration and it will pass. <br/>
****************************<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s something you can only know through experimentation, really, <br/>
and looking at big patterns of behavior over time. I&#39;d look to see if <br/>
there were any kind of pattern to *when* your dd is blowing up - <br/>
could she be hungry or tired or overwhelmed or lonely or bored? could <br/>
frustrations be &quot;stacking up&quot; over a day or week? She may not be able <br/>
to articulate what she&#39;s feeling overall and have more of a &quot;last <br/>
straw&quot; reaction - one tiny thing would be enough to set her off, but <br/>
its not really about that one tiny thing, that&#39;s just the trigger.<br/>
<br/>
I also wonder what kinds of rules/expectations y&#39;all have had in the <br/>
past around &quot;correct&quot; behavior. This could be part of her deschooling <br/>
process - she isn&#39;t sure where the boundaries are and is trying to <br/>
figure that out. Personally, I don&#39;t think so much in terms <br/>
of &quot;setting&quot; boundaries - I *have* personal boundaries and so do my <br/>
family members, and its important to express those and honor them. At <br/>
the same time, my own boundaries can sometimes be more fluid - <br/>
because I&#39;m an adult and can have a certain amount of compassion for <br/>
my kids&#39; needs. My kids boundaries aren&#39;t necessarily as fluid as <br/>
mine, so its important that I help them express *and* defend those <br/>
boundaries.<br/>
<br/>
So, for example, I might not react to my 7yo when she says something <br/>
to me like &quot;you&#39;re an idiot&quot; (or I might say &quot;I&#39;m sorry you feel that <br/>
way, want a sandwich?&quot;), but if she said that to Ray or a same age <br/>
friend, I&#39;d more likely jump in with &quot;hey! that&#39;s not necessary. do <br/>
you need something?&quot;<br/>

<br/>
I want to point out to you that in your whole post you didn&#39;t write one <br/>
word about what he is angry about, as if what matters is his outward <br/>
behavior, not his inward feelings.<br/>
<br/>
That is like focusing on symptoms and ignoring the underlying cause of <br/>
an illness.<br/>

<br/>
Anyway - in your next post you said you tried talking to her but she <br/>
gets more angry.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have no clue what is making her angry?<br/>
<br/>
Frustration is the most common trigger for anger - maybe start first <br/>
looking at what might be frustrating her.<br/>
When talking to a kid makes them more angry, that&#39;s because they don&#39;t <br/>
know how to articulate what it is they are feeling or it is something <br/>
that they think will really upset you (like, &quot;I can&#39;t STAND my sibling&quot;, <br/>
but they really want you to &quot;just know.&quot; So - the best you can do is <br/>
make close observations and take a guess. Make some changes. Go out <br/>
more, stay home more, separate the kids more by having one go off to a <br/>
friend&#39;s house while the other stays home and taking one out with you <br/>
even just to the grocery store while the other stays home with dad, and <br/>
so on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1993065975">My 6 year old has a tendency to name call.  If it is at me I might <br/>
respond that I dont like being called names, I sometimes express my <br/>
understanding of the underlying emotions he has (I can typically guess <br/>
what is wrong).  If it is at siblings or friends, I let him know that I <br/>
cant allow him to hurt others feelings.  I just say, &quot; I love so and so <br/>
and I cant let you hurt her, just like I wouldnt let her say something <br/>
like that to you.&quot;</div>
