<br/>
Does anyone know much about the unschooling conferences that were held in<br/>
Australia and Cancun? Are there others being held in cool places around the<br/>

**************<br/>
Gosh, it&#39;s hard to get cooler than Peabody, Massachusetts. <br/>
<br/>
Well, okay... Peabody itself is not really the hotbed of excitement some <br/>
would expect. BUT:<br/>
<br/>
* it&#39;s near Salem, a National Historic site, which has witch museums, a <br/>
pirate museum, the Peabody Essex Museum, great restaurants, a small fun amusement <br/>
park (The Willows), witchy shops, etc.<br/>
* it&#39;s near Boston, site of more excitement than you can probably stand<br/>
*It&#39;s near Gloucester, an amazing seaside city with whale watches, etc.<br/>
<br/>
AND it&#39;s the site of the 3rd Annual Live and Learn Unschooling Conference, <br/>
where you can hang out with 342 (so far) unschooling folks. I mean...how cool is <br/>
that?<br/>
