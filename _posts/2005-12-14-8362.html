<div id="ygrps-yiv-72836872">We have been deprogramming since April when we switched from home at <br/>
school to unschooling.  My dd is 11yo.  Over the weekend she did a 2 <br/>
page report (single spaced) on cats anatomy and behavior.  She&#39;s <br/>
interested in becoming a vet.  She started this on Saturday night <br/>
and without any prompting by us.<br/>
<br/>
But today she came to me before dinner and kept saying I&#39;m bored <br/>
over and over again.  Because it was close to dinner I asked if she <br/>
wanted to make something, she did, and she made dinner for the two <br/>
of us.  Dad is at the firehouse today.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I don&#39;t know what to do when this boredom stuff starts up.  <br/>
I made suggestions but she looks at me and says no, no, no to <br/>
everything I mentioned.  I remembered in one of my books about a mom <br/>
who&#39;s son was bored for about a week or so then he finally figured <br/>
out what he wanted to pursue.  <br/>
<br/>
Do I let her have space or suggest things.  It&#39;s times like this <br/>
that I begin to question myself about unschooling, even though I <br/>
know that as a family we are on the right journey together.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-646453562">&quot;Do I let her have space or suggest things. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Both.  I have found that my kids don&#39;t usually run with my <br/>
suggestions, but making suggestions gets them thinking, so it&#39;s <br/>
still a good thing.:)  After I run through about ten things, they&#39;ll <br/>
usually go &quot;I know what I want to do&quot; and run off.<br/>
<br/>
It might be a sign that she&#39;s ready to go and do more, it might just <br/>
be the age. All of my children so far have gone through a sort of <br/>
restless phase right around 12 years old or so. Trevor had another <br/>
one around the beginning of this year.  Part of it is just trying to <br/>
figure out what excites them, what they love.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe gather up brochures and event listings of local stuff that <br/>
looks fun, get a couple new magazine subsriptions, go to a movie, <br/>
try a new restaurant, keep lots of options available that she can <br/>
look through when she needs inspiration.<br/>
I like &quot;idea&quot; lists...gives us a place to go for fun ideas when we <br/>
need them. You can keep adding to it over the months, as you find <br/>
new things.<br/>

you. My DS is 7 and on those rare times he says he&#39;s bored usually <br/>
what he wants is not suggestions of stuff -he- can do but rather <br/>
stuff -we- can do together. Especially at that pre-teen time she might <br/>
be needing some big doses of close mom-time<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1201987581">Deb - that is so funny that you said that - &quot;mom & me time.&quot;  After I <br/>
did the dishes she came and we started making bubbles with the dish <br/>
soap.  We were trying to see who could make the biggest one.  Then she <br/>
wanted to see if the dog could see the bubbles.  It was a great mom <br/>
and me moment.  Now, she&#39;s back on the computer and designing a new <br/>
Neopet fairie.  I think I&#39;ll send her a challenge.<br/>
<br/>
Happy with our new life,<br/>

<br/>
Our dog loves chasing bubbles and &#39;biting&#39;/popping them when we have <br/>
the bubble wands out. <br/>
