 <br/>
It is a beautiful magazine!<br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;re looking forward to this next issue----maybe tomorrow? Great!<br/>
 <br/>
I highly recommend it too. I usually keep an issue in my bag when I&#39;m out  & <br/>
about. I can hand it to a mom with a small fidgety child and they can look  <br/>
through it together rather than get more fidgety (child) and angrier  (mom).<br/>

My ds (11.9) is about to publish his first website (the address will be aliencomix.com when I get around to purchasing the domain) <br/>
<br/>
Part of his site is a gallery of kids art. If your daughter would like to be the first artist, my son would honored. His address is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:ben@...">ben@...</a><br/>
