<div id="ygrps-yiv-510434386">I just wanted to mention that I read a great book that was highly <br/>
recommended by homeschool conference keynote speaker.  The name of the <br/>
book is &quot;Families Where Grace Is In Place - Getting Free from the <br/>
Burden of Pressuring, Controlling, and Manipulating Your Spouse and <br/>
Children&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I really enjoyed the book and thought I would let you all know about it.<br/>
