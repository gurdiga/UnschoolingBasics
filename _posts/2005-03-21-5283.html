<div id="ygrps-yiv-1272944289">Thanks. I had tried accessing it from a google search. I couldn&#39;t remember if there was a deadline. I&#39;m rather gifted in the art of procrastanation so I need plenty of notice for things, that way I have more time to procrastanate :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1235689131">I just got off the phone with my school district to withdraw Moira from<br/>
school tomorrow.  The lady first said I had to submit a curriculum within 30<br/>
days.  I pointed out that school is not compulsory here until 1st grade,<br/>
which she double checked, then conceded.  I do have to have my paperwork<br/>
filed by August 1 for next year.  For this year, I just have to notify the<br/>
school she is in.  So here we go down the yellow brick road.<br/>

Congratulations, Judy.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a &quot;Curriculum&quot; created by an Unschooler, Carol Narigon, which may<br/>
assist you with the formality.<br/>

I think Pam has posted something similar which may be of use to you also. <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t forget your local or Statewide organization for help with that too.<br/>

I&#39;m having a challenge getting to the Live and Learn website for <br/>
information on<br/>
the conference. I&#39;ve tried accessing it from google and sandra dodd&#39;s <br/>
website.<br/>
No luck. Does anyone know when the deadline for registration <br/>
is?-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No deadline yet---you&#39;re still OK! We haven&#39;t even started TAKING <br/>
registrations yet!<br/>
<br/>
Still a few kinks to work out. Looks as if we&#39;re almost there!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll post everywhere as soon as I&#39;m ready to take your money!! I <br/>
promise! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
