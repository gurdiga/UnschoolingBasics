<div id="ygrps-yiv-2032164856">I&#39;d like to hear from moms of many.<br/>
<br/>
I have 6 girls, 4 of whose ideas,dreams and activities are big enough to dominate our whole family.  How do you say yes often enough to make sure they&#39;re each able to follow their dreams?<br/>
<br/>
One tool we use is a wall calendar that shows all the planned activities.  When things overlap, the calendar wins because it&#39;s the only evidence we have of &quot;who reserved the time first&quot;  it&#39;s usually not an issue, since the kids are really good about arranging alternate transportation when they need it.  Transportation can be a big deal.  Since we&#39;ve been using the big calendar, no one has needed to skip anything.<br/>
<br/>
I guess that my main question is about how to deal with several people with different interests and needs.  (except they all NEED to watch a different TV show at the same time, they all NEED to use the same computer at the same time) We have family meetings, where we discuss issues, propose solutions, and try to meet everyone&#39;s needs with a group consensus.  What more could we be doing?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to to &quot;official&quot; unschooling.  A few months ago I was just happy to be homeschool &quot;slackers&quot; I didn&#39;t really care about a label, we&#39;re just being &quot;us.&quot;  I read John Holt & a bunch of unschool philosophies over 10 years ago, but haven&#39;t since then.  I still don&#39;t care about the label, but I&#39;m interested in hearing from other unschooling moms of many.  <br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;m just overwhelmed by the presence of so many personalities in one place.  I love it, but I&#39;m not above some expert advice here, help!  <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1039994343">I may not be a mom of &quot;many&quot;, only 3...but we are already having those<br/>
issues.  Like who will play on what computer when and the use of the<br/>
TV.  Maybe a calendar sign up would be a good idea here, so they can<br/>
schedule their own time?  <br/>
