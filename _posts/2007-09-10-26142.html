<div id="ygrps-yiv-345084553">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I would like to find four other people who are registered<br/>
homeschoolers to participate with me in discounted online courses<br/>
through lynda.com.<br/>
<br/>
At lynda.com you can take well-regarded, online courses in the latest<br/>
web design, audio and video related software and techniques<br/>
(everything from Photoshop to podcasting). You can go the site and<br/>
view sample video lessons, if you like.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a short article about lynda.com, incase you have not heard of it:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tech.yahoo.com/blogs/devlin/4806;_ylt=AqMNaw2VkDHt0msdmawT8BQWLpA5">http://tech.yahoo.com/blogs/devlin/4806;_ylt=AqMNaw2VkDHt0msdmawT8BQWLpA5</a><br/>
<br/>
Their Educator&#39;s Resource page reads:<br/>
Discounted Student Enrollment Program. This exciting offer allows you<br/>
to select up to 5 of our Online Training Library® titles to make<br/>
available to your students over a predefined term that you schedule,<br/>
all for a dramatically reduced one-time fee that&#39;s pro-rated at $10.00<br/>
per month. What&#39;s more, if ten or more of your students take advantage<br/>
of the service, you receive complimentary access to our entire Online<br/>
Training Library® at our &quot;Premium&quot; membership level for the term of<br/>
your students&#39; enrollment.<br/>
<br/>
I have been in contact with them and we need at least five people to<br/>
sign up for this, who have some proof of homeschooling status or any<br/>
kind of educator/student status, I believe.<br/>
<br/>
If we found a group of people that were interested, we could try it<br/>
for a month and see how it goes.<br/>
<br/>
Please reply to me directly, if you are interested.<br/>
<br/>
I think I am going to get the standard month subscription for $25, if<br/>
I cannot find enough people to participate.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
