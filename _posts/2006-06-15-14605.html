<div id="ygrps-yiv-164387218">My 16-YO niece just called and asked if she could move in with me.  I <br/>
haven&#39;t seen her for a year (lives in a neighboring state).  She hates <br/>
school and has always struggled with it.  I think she is hoping that  <br/>
I won&#39;t make her finish school next year.  <br/>
<br/>
If it were up to me, I wouldn&#39;t make her go and just try to support <br/>
her.  However, her mother (whom I haven&#39;t seen or spoken with for <br/>
years since she and my brother were divorced but not due to animosity, <br/>
just the way it&#39;s gone) is very worried about her terrible grades and <br/>
skipping school and such.  I just don&#39;t see her liking the idea of her <br/>
daughter coming here and not doing school.  I have always liked my <br/>
niece and want to help her.  Is there any info I could send my niece <br/>
that she could share with her mom concerning how kids do who don&#39;t <br/>
graduate.  Her mom is worried that she won&#39;t be able to get a job <br/>
without a diploma.  Maybe some info would help her feel better and <br/>
lighten up regarding school.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

What state is she in? What state are you in? Can you get her a high  <br/>
school diploma now, so her mom can stop worrying and she can get out  <br/>
of school?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>FWIW, I graduated from High school and was never sent a diploma. I<br/>
never had an employer verify whether I had graduted from High School<br/>
or not. I had several jobs in the 12 years between graduating from HS<br/>
in 1989 and college in 2001! The only education that was ever verified<br/>
was my Bachelor&#39;s degree when I applied for a job as a Nurse. <br/>
<br/>
And if a HS diploma is needed for higher ed, the GED is always an option.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-747380136">I live in Idaho and she currently lives in Oregon.  I have a copy of <br/>
The Teenage Liberation Handbook and was thinking that would be good, <br/>
but I don&#39;t know if she would read that.  I was thinking about a <br/>
short reference sheet stating that most colleges accept kids with <br/>
GEDs.  Wasn&#39;t there a post regarding this awhile back?  I didn&#39;t <br/>
know she could get her high school diploma early.  She just <br/>
completed her Junior year and she failed many of her classes and <br/>
she&#39;s looking at summer school that her parents want her to attend.  <br/>
I suspect that&#39;s a big reason she wants to head my way.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks Pam,<br/>

with us last year.  So far it has been great and he doesn&#39;t want to move <br/>
back.  But of course, I do have the support of his mom and the rest of <br/>
the family.<br/>
