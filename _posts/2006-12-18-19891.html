<div id="ygrps-yiv-566934710">Yes!  I actually do not hang out with a family<br/>
anymore, even though my husband has remained close<br/>
with them.  I found that the children (who my daughter<br/>
played with often) were shaping her into being a more<br/>
competitive non sharing child.  Also she thought that<br/>
it was &quot;ok&quot; to exclude certain children etc.  I saw<br/>
that the mother was not open to any suggestions or<br/>
interference, so we do not play there any longer, and<br/>
I am still working on moving faith away from some of<br/>
those &quot;habits.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1016126356">I find it kind of hard with the gals in our neighborhood.  When they get together what do they talk about?  What their kids are doing in school of course.  So I always end up feeling like the odd man out.  Even when our family gets together with friends inevitably people start talking about what their kids are doing at school.  Although with our really close friends it does not matter........they accept our lifestyle and they accept ours.  I also have a problem with the show off, bullying, competitive type kids.  One day the girls came in the house and told me that one of the neighborhood kids said that if you homeschool you are not learning anything.  It&#39;s one kid in particular that keeps saying these kinds of things to them......he is seriously misinformed.  So I&#39;ve discussed with my kids that they are learning!  And I just find it so beautiful and refreshing that we are not caught up in the game of Oh, my Billy got an A+ in Math, what did your Susie get?  Or Billy is the<br/>
 star of his soccer team, does your Johnny do sports?  And I think eventually my girls will effectively weed out the snobbish, bullying, competitive types and hang out with kids that love them for who they are.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1355938898">thank you everyone for making me feel better about the  lost friendship <br/>
thing! I felt really guilty earlier today because this one  family in particular <br/>
sent me a holiday card and the children in the  picture were HUGE. It has been <br/>
years since I&#39;ve seen them. I really miss  the mom and dad. We were so close <br/>
years ago and they are beautiful  people, but the children were SERIOUSLY <br/>
competitive and did a lot of cruel  bullying. My children asked that we not hang out <br/>
with them anymore  and it would have been impossible for me to stay friends <br/>
with the parents  and not with the kids! There were so many issues with <br/>
academic  competition. Their children would say &quot;look at what I can read, can  YOU <br/>
read it?&quot; Or &quot;I can do long division,  can you?&quot; The thing that  really caused <br/>
us to separate from them was an issue pertaining to  swimming. I decided to <br/>
unschool my children  with swimming (VERY controversial in FL by the way because <br/>
we are  surrounded in water! Most people around here think I am an awful mom <br/>
for  waiting) My children enjoyed going in water with floaties for  years but <br/>
never wanted to wet their faces or try strokes or  floating. They could not <br/>
swim at all until this last summer (at  ages 10, 8 and 6) when they asked me if <br/>
they could learn and take  lessons from a private teacher who was gentle and <br/>
quiet in his approach  (this man is a SAINT by the way, he had them swimming in <br/>
5 minutes and  everything about him was so unschool friendly and affirming to <br/>
their  beautiful hearts and minds; the first thing he told them was &quot;if you <br/>
don&#39;t  want to try anything just say no and we&#39;ll get around to it some other  <br/>
time) The funny thing is now, after a week of lessons and a summer of  swim fun <br/>
they are swimming LIKE FISH. Next summer they are joining a  dive team, LOL! <br/>
It is so typical of how unschooling works. Wait till you  are ready and then <br/>
when you are, you SOAR! <br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, a few years ago when we were still trying to be  friends with these <br/>
people their kids were swimming super well (and were  VERY young) and they kept <br/>
taunting my children about their float devices  and not wanting to go under <br/>
water. Finally, the middle child in the family  PUSHED my oldest son into the <br/>
deep end and yelled &quot;DROWN&quot; then  started laughing. His mom went &quot;after him&quot; to <br/>
punish him and he jumped in  the water, then every time he would come to the <br/>
surface she would yell and  he would go back under so he couldn&#39;t hear. She <br/>
gave up in about 20  seconds. It was HORRIFYING. My son was totally frightened <br/>
and humiliated.  It was the first time (and only time, thank goodness) he told <br/>
me he was &quot;a  loser.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
We never visited with them again.<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m really glad that I&#39;m not alone in the  occasional alienation. It <br/>
can be very sad.<br/>

PS please don&#39;t scold me for being a bad mom and not  teaching them to swim - <br/>
I PROMISE they just weren&#39;t ready yet and I was  always ULTRA ULTRA careful <br/>
around water (still am, but at least I don&#39;t  have to act paranoid about it  <br/>
anymore!) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1829405369">I was a Nanny for 8 years before I became a foster parent and then later adopted my two daughters.  I remember I was taking care of this 3 year old little boy.  He was taking swim lessons at the Y.  First day of swimming lessons the instructor grabbed him and shoved him in the water.  Of course this little boy freaked!  Not only was the instructor a stranger to him, but he was being put in the water against his will.  I took him, dried him off, and took him home.  When I told his Mother she freaked too.  It just felt so wrong.  When I took my girls in as foster children, I let them do the swimming thing on their terms.  Lexi (8) spent two summers just sitting on the side of the pool.  The third year she only went in occasionally.  Well now at 8 she is a fish, and loves to swim.  And I do not allow my children to hold anyone under water, it&#39;s a safety issue........no room for negotiation.  And I would never allow anyone else to hold my children under water, even if it meant<br/>
 me removing the child away from my child.  So you did the right thing where these friends were concerned, and you did the right thing with letting your kids learn to swim on their terms.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1217554966">I&#39;m facing this issue right now. I have a friend who I connect with very<br/>
deeply. She has 2 sons, one my daughters age (3) and one 5. Her sons used to<br/>
be so kind to my daughter, before the older one started kindergarten. The<br/>
older one in particular, always made sure she was tended to, made sure she<br/>
had all the snacks, drinks, toys, etc. she could possibly want while at<br/>
their house. The younger one and she would always hold hands, and huddle<br/>
together talking about whatever it was that had their fancy in the moment.<br/>
Since the older boy started kindergarten (last fall), things have gone<br/>
dramatically downhill. The older boy is rude and mean to my daughter, he<br/>
ridicules his younger brothers (age appropriate) likes .the games he likes,<br/>
the books, television shows, cd&#39;s, you name it. Then the younger one starts<br/>
ridiculing my daughter in the same way. It was too heartbreaking to watch<br/>
her confusion at this very sudden change in the relationship. She used to<br/>
ask to see them all the time, and since the last time we were there (3 weeks<br/>
ago) she hasn&#39;t mentioned the boys once. She occasionally will still ask if<br/>
we are going to see the mom - she is very kind and aware in many ways, but<br/>
is seemingly oblivious to this change in her boys regarding my daughter -<br/>
and I just say &quot;Not today, today we&#39;re going to see/do ___________.&quot; Ever<br/>
since the older boy started kindergarten, the mom has spent waaay too much<br/>
time talking about how the teacher loves her son, how kind he is to the<br/>
other students, how sweet he is, etc., when right in front of her she can<br/>
witness him being so unkind to my daughter.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I love this woman, but not all relationships are meant to go the distance,<br/>
and I have to accept that this may be one of those. I imagine that, if we<br/>
stay in minimal contact, then once her younger son is also in kindergarten,<br/>
we may be able to see one another again, with just my kids present. Then<br/>
again, I may be dreaming.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Any way you slice it, it&#39;s sad. But there&#39;s no way I&#39;ll value a friendship<br/>
of mine at the expense of my kids. They are beautiful, unsullied, free<br/>
beings. I&#39;m not going to expose them to the kind of treatment that would,<br/>
clearly, cause confusion and hurt.<br/>

Has anyone been really great friends with a family when all your collective <br/>
children were little, then once the kids (from the other family) started <br/>
school you found that you couldn&#39;t socialize with them anymore? I try to<br/>
have a <br/>
really open mind and a diverse pool of friends but I won&#39;t force my children<br/>
<br/>
to be around kids that are competitive, show-off, bullies with horrible<br/>
values <br/>

least repeat that.<br/>
<br/>
If the parents allow their kids to get the idea that homeschooling  <br/>
and schooling are equally good then the parents have no leverage to  <br/>
get the kids to go to school when the kids don&#39;t want to. So the  <br/>
parents *have to* tell their kids that those homeschoolers aren&#39;t  <br/>
going to learn anything.<br/>
<br/>
And even if kids allow themselves to believe that homeschooling and  <br/>
schooling are equal, then what is the purpose of all the hard work  <br/>
and dullness their parents are making them go through everyday? To  <br/>
preserve their sanity they *have* to believe that what they&#39;re doing  <br/>
is worth the pain and aggravation and tedium and worth giving up all  <br/>
the things they&#39;d rather be doing.<br/>
<br/>
And the parents believe school is necessary for that that reason too.  <br/>
If playing all day will prepare kids for life as well as school, then  <br/>
what was the purpose of those 12+ years of their own childhoods they  <br/>
sacrificed for school?<br/>

the Y, the teacher was old and mean.  ODD would NOT out her face in the<br/>
water, I knew she would when she was ready, not forced.  So on the last day<br/>
of lessons (she chose to keep going) the teacher meanly said to her &quot;if you<br/>
don;t out your face in the water you won&#39;t pass this class&quot;  She got up,<br/>
looked at him and said &quot;I don&#39;t know what pass is but I am not putting my<br/>
face in the water&quot; You should have seen the look on his face! We left LOL I<br/>

 </span></blockquote>i started taking my ds to gymnastics last year with an homeschooling group <br/>
and see the same behavior in many of the kids.  to the degree that i thought <br/>
about taking my son out but he really liked going so i didnt.  i signed him <br/>
up for next semester but havnt descided.  there are 2 or 3 older boys in the <br/>
group that have younger siblings and treat them awfully.  then the younger <br/>
kids who are my kids ages do the same things to anyone they dont know well.  <br/>
Since the parents just drop them off and leave before class even starts they <br/>
dont see any of it and truthfully when they are there they dont see it <br/>
either or think it is normal behavior.  my older son does tease my younger <br/>
(5 and 4) sometimes and i think that is normal but he is not cruel and i <br/>
talk to him about how he makes others feel.<br/>
one thing i have noticed in the past 6 months or so is that my older son <br/>
does get a little bossy sometimes with the  3 year olds that come over.  he <br/>
really likes video games and they cant play them and it bugs him.  i think <br/>
he gets frustrated because he would rather one his older friends were there. <br/>
  but sometimes that is not easy to arrange.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391763511">Good Points!  When my own 8 year old daughter told me she was &quot;DONE&quot; with school I listened, but obviously most parents don&#39;t listen.  My daughter had already tuned out so to speak.  I&#39;m so glad I listened to her.  PS was pure torture for her.<br/>

&gt; One day the girls came in the house and told me that one of the <br/>
&gt; neighborhood kids said that if you homeschool you are not learning <br/>
&gt; anything. It&#39;s one kid in particular that keeps saying these kinds <br/>
&gt; of things to them......he is seriously misinformed. So I&#39;ve <br/>
&gt; discussed with my kids that they are learning!<br/>
<br/>
You might also want to talk about why the kids believe that or at <br/>
least repeat that.<br/>
<br/>
If the parents allow their kids to get the idea that homeschooling <br/>
and schooling are equally good then the parents have no leverage to <br/>
get the kids to go to school when the kids don&#39;t want to. So the <br/>
parents *have to* tell their kids that those homeschoolers aren&#39;t <br/>
going to learn anything.<br/>
<br/>
And even if kids allow themselves to believe that homeschooling and <br/>
schooling are equal, then what is the purpose of all the hard work <br/>
and dullness their parents are making them go through everyday? To <br/>
preserve their sanity they *have* to believe that what they&#39;re doing <br/>
is worth the pain and aggravation and tedium and worth giving up all <br/>
the things they&#39;d rather be doing.<br/>
<br/>
And the parents believe school is necessary for that that reason too. <br/>
If playing all day will prepare kids for life as well as school, then <br/>
what was the purpose of those 12+ years of their own childhoods they <br/>
sacrificed for school?<br/>

          OH MY! We had a similar swim experience- when odd was 5 we tried lessons at<br/>
the Y, the teacher was old and mean. ODD would NOT out her face in the<br/>
water, I knew she would when she was ready, not forced. So on the last day<br/>
of lessons (she chose to keep going) the teacher meanly said to her &quot;if you<br/>
don;t out your face in the water you won&#39;t pass this class&quot; She got up,<br/>
looked at him and said &quot;I don&#39;t know what pass is but I am not putting my<br/>
face in the water&quot; You should have seen the look on his face! We left LOL I<br/>
laughed the whole way home- I was so proud of her! FWIW she is now at 7 a<br/>
fish!<br/>
