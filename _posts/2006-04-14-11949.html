<div id="ygrps-yiv-517055494">&lt;&lt;Is there a hair stylist that you could make an appointment with to talk to<br/>
her about what possiblities she has with her hair?  Can her hair be relaxed<br/>
or straightened to do more what she wants?  It may be that she just needs a<br/>
nice &quot;makeover&quot; to feel good about who she is.  Nothing drastic, just<br/>
something new.  Maybe leave her at a salon for her to discuss what she wants<br/>
with someone who can tell her more what she can do with her hair.  (Just<br/>
make sure to put a price limit on the changes :) )&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to do a relaxer - I think 7 yrs old is too young for that.  Not to mention too damaging to her hair.  But I will do braids.  This weekend I&#39;m going to braid her hair.  She wants lots of skinny braids so I&#39;ll have to set aside a chunk of time.  I remember that my mom used to pay a neighbor of ours to braid mine and my sister&#39;s hair.  She didn&#39;t like to do hair too much.  I admit, I don&#39;t like to do hair much either!  LOL<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the suggestions.<br/>

&quot;Don&#39;t be afraid of showing affection. Be warm and tender, thoughtful and affectionate. Mankind is more helped by sympathy than by service. Love is more than money, and a kind word will give more pleasure than a present.&quot; <br/>
