************<br/>
 <br/>
I used to be a commercial interior designer/draftsman in the days before  <br/>
computers.  It is a job that uses plenty of math.  I worked at several  different <br/>
companies and one of the first things I received at each new job  was the <br/>
math cheat sheet!  It would have all the common formulas we would  encounter and <br/>
exactly what to do with them.  Sometimes the formulas varied  from company to <br/>
company.<br/>
 <br/>
They gave me a cheat sheet because they wanted everyone doing the same  <br/>
thing....quickly.... and they knew that just because we had 12+ years of  math <br/>
didn&#39;t mean that we could estimate how many rolls of wall paper to order  for a <br/>
million dollar hotel installation.  Nobody at the company cared what  my math <br/>
skills were (that I *could* figure that out without a cheat sheet), just  that I <br/>
could do my job quickly and correctly.<br/>
 <br/>
Oh, and after using them often enough, I didn&#39;t have to use my cheat  sheet.  <br/>
There were several fractions I came across so often that I didn&#39;t  have to <br/>
look them up or calculate them.  I was measuring something at home  recently and <br/>
found that I know longer knew automatically what 7/16ths plus  7/32ths was.  <br/>
I can figure it out, but it isn&#39;t as natural as two plus two  anymore.  It <br/>
just isn&#39;t relevant anymore, but if it became relevant I would  either learn the <br/>
answer or make a new cheat sheet.  :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My DS is 7. He&#39;s understood the concept of multiplication for <br/>
somewhere around 2 years - because he saw us use it. And, when he was <br/>
doing something with multiple &#39;piles&#39; of something (like stacks of <br/>
pennies), he knew to ask &quot;what&#39;s 10 times 6?&quot;. Sometimes in the car <br/>
he&#39;d say &quot;Mommy, what&#39;s 6+6+6+6+6+6+6+6+6 equal?&quot; I had to be alert so <br/>
I could keep track of how many sizes (or whatever) he said - then I&#39;d <br/>
say &quot;that was nine sixes so that&#39;s nine times six, that&#39;s 54&quot;. Within <br/>
the last month roughly he&#39;s been more interested in the details, <br/>
asking lots more of the &quot;what does...equal?&quot; questions. So, I sketched <br/>
the basic &quot;multiplication table&quot; (1-10) and an &quot;addition table&quot; (1-10) <br/>
on our kitchen chalkboard (it&#39;s 4&#39;x8&#39;). Now they&#39;re there for him if <br/>
he wants to check something (didn&#39;t have enough room to go higher than <br/>
10, lots of other stuff floating around the chalkboard). He&#39;s also <br/>
noticing things like 10 PLUS 10 is 20 but 10 TIMES 10 is 100 and that <br/>
10 PLUS 10 is the same as 10 TIMES 2. All his own discoveries. Which <br/>
do think would stay with him better - something that connects deeply <br/>
because he &#39;owns&#39; the idea or information or something I forced on him <br/>
because he was 7 and that&#39;s what 7 yr olds are &#39;supposed&#39; to do? Once <br/>
the concept is there, the data can be added easily as needed. And <br/>
there&#39;s the key - *as needed* with need being defined not solely in <br/>
utility terms but also including the aspect of personal satisfaction <br/>
(like when you can&#39;t remember the name of that actor, you know, that <br/>
one who was in... so you go look it up because you &quot;need&quot; to find out <br/>
for your own satisfaction). Right now, DS &quot;needs&quot; to explore numbers, <br/>
just as he explored letters, sounds, words and grew into reading <br/>
organically, as a part of himself.<br/>
