&quot;Can you recommend a good book that isn&#39;t too heavy in it&#39;s presentation<br/>
that<br/>
would provide more info about the child development?&quot;<br/>
The best ones I&#39;ve seen that were specifically about child development at the <br/>
different ages were the series by Louise Bates Ames of the Gesell Institute <br/>
of Child Development (or something like that!).  There is a small little book <br/>
for each age and I find them at my local library (although they&#39;re also on <br/>
amazon).  They were published back in the 70&#39;s so there is quite a lot you have to <br/>
ignore (the parts giving parenting advise for sure), but thankfully most of <br/>
the books are focused specifically on what behavioural stages each age brings, <br/>
and how kids think at different age.  I&#39;ve found them very helpful and a <br/>
really quick read...well, especially is you do like I do, and just skim through for <br/>
the parts that pertain to us :)<br/>
