<div id="ygrps-yiv-112144738">Hi Ladies,<br/>
<br/>
I was just wondering if there was anyone on the list who unschools in <br/>
Alabama & if there is an unschooling group in the area. I live in <br/>
south Alabama between Mobile & Pensacola, FL. Thanks!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Tracy, as Ren said you might want to consider heading over to P&#39;cola<br/>
on Wednesdays for our LIFE group.  There are a few of us unschoolers<br/>
still holding out amongst the group.  Although it isn&#39;t all<br/>
unschoolers everyone is respectful. Lots of gentle parenting and child<br/>
lead interest activities.  We meet Wednesday from 11-2 at the Bayview<br/>
Community Center (LMK if you need directions).  If you go to the<br/>
website for the community center it actually says we meet on Tuesdays.<br/>
 We&#39;ve notified them of the error and they are trying to fix it.  They<br/>
know we have met there for going on 5 years on Wednesdays so they<br/>
aren&#39;t sure why it says Tuesday.  You can give me a call if you want<br/>
to talk or just get together.  (474-0817)  We are losing the community<br/>
center for 2 weeks starting the Wednesday after this one as they are<br/>
stripping the floors in the gym and it is quite toxic (which makes me<br/>
curious as to what they do with all the school children who are in<br/>
after school care?)  We hopefully are either going to go to the<br/>
Environmental Center or the Silver Screen movie theater (for a tour<br/>
and movie and lunch).  One week we are heading out to the beach as one<br/>
of our &quot;seasonal&quot; members has rents a condo out there each fall and<br/>
invites us over.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you there.  Oh if you want to check the group out we have<br/>
a yahoogroup called PensacolaLIFEHomeschool<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-494151154">Hi Michelle,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the info! I don&#39;t know my way around Pensacola, so I will <br/>
probably need directions. :) I joined the group you suggested. Hope to <br/>
meet you all soon. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-794647349">Hey Tracy,<br/>
   <br/>
  Sorry I am just now replying to this, but we just got back from vacation! I live in Alabama, but we live closer to B&#39;ham. My dd is 12yro and although we&#39;ve homeschooled for about 2 1/2 yrs now, we just started unschooling in April. There is also an Alabama Unschooler yahoo group, but not a lot goes on there (nothing like this group!). We just got back from the Rethinking Education Conference in Texas and we were the ONLY family from AL! We wanted to go to the Live and Learn conference too but our schedule didn&#39;t permit this year, but next year we want to do both conferences AND send our dd to Not Back To School Camp. I hope we have the money for all of it. I hope you can connect with other unschoolers in your area, we don&#39;t know any other unschoolers and I thought the conference was great b/c we could be with other freedom loving families! It&#39;s hard to establish a support system when you&#39;re the only ones you know that do what you do!<br/>
   <br/>
  Best Wishes!<br/>

<br/>
Leslie - When I went to Live and Learn last year, I actually found out there were two other moms from Alabama, but none from Mississippi.  I looked because I live close to the MS/AL border and love going camping along Hwy. 45.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m having lunch in Birmingham with two other radical unschooling moms Sat.  Plans are still not set, but maybe you could meet us there.  And I&#39;m saying that here, so if anyone else is out there and wants to drive to Birmingham Sat. the 9th, email me off-list so I can tell you what restaurant when we figure it out!<br/>
