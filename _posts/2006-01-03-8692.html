Ren sent this link out a few weeks ago and I have just now read the discussion in its entirety.  THANK YOU, REN!  I am so inspired by this article and feel that I am so on the right track with unschooling and my relationships with my children in general.  I have truly received the greatest amount of healing from past childhood hurts since becoming a mother.  Unschooling is continuing that process and I am getting better and better as a result.  <br/>
<br/>
One thing I have thought about is the story about the mother who acquired a horse for her children.  When I heard that the next Conference would be in AZ, I thought that chances of me and my family attending would be slim as I live in TN.  However, I am going to use creative thinking and figure out how I am going to make it there.  The discussion between Ren and Sandra Dodd made me realize that I NEED to attend the conference.  I will definitely be ordering a few of the CD&#39;s from the 2005 conference!<br/>
<br/>
Much Love<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1035479332">Hey!  I&#39;m the Leslie quoted at the top of the talk!<br/>
 <br/>
Although it is not entirely true.  I created that affirmation a few  years <br/>
before I heard about unschooling.  When I was thinking about  homeschooling and <br/>
found unschooling on the internet, that affirmation from years  before came <br/>
back to me.  I knew I had finally found how to get that  peace and joy.<br/>
 <br/>
I wonder where Ren and Sandra found that...on unschooling.com maybe??<br/>
