<div id="ygrps-yiv-1153294642">I just had to respond to this issue on food because I had a real life <br/>
experience yesterday that I thought I would share.  We (my family) are <br/>
fairly healthy eaters; mostly vegetarian with lots of vegetables, <br/>
beans, and whole grains.  My sister, who we are staying with at the <br/>
moment (Robin, not Ren), survives on frozen dinners, chips, sugary <br/>
cereal, etc.  Let me preface though that even though we mostly eat <br/>
healthy I always keep chips, soda, poptarts, etc in my pantry for the <br/>
kids if they want it.  Since being at my sisters I haven&#39;t stocked her <br/>
fridge like I normally stock mine.  Yesterday Calista (7 years old) <br/>
came to me because she was hungry looking for something to eat so I <br/>
gave her the choices that were in the cupboards and fridge.  She burst <br/>
into tears and said, &quot;Mom, I want something HEALTHY!!!&quot;  They are <br/>
tired of eating processed food and her body is screaming at her to <br/>
stop!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t monitor my kids choice of foods AT ALL!  We talk about what <br/>
food does after you swallow it and how it might make you feel but I <br/>
have plenty of junk food in my house.  I also have very healthy food <br/>
out that is easy to get to; often leaving plates of fruits and <br/>
vegetables out on the table to nibble on all day along with the M&M&#39;s <br/>
and soda.  Most of the time the fruits and vegetables disappear and <br/>
the M&M&#39;s are still there.  They do learn to listen to their bodies <br/>
but sometimes it takes a little bit of time to figure it out.<br/>
<br/>
I remember one time we made homemade dougnuts and Kevin ate 8 or 9 of <br/>
them and spent most of the night puking.  He hasn&#39;t gorged on anything <br/>
since.  He knows that if he wants more of something he can have it <br/>
tomorrow, he doesn&#39;t need to eat it ALL today.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-678131516">I have a food question:  How do you let the children choose their food, and still sit down to dinner together.  My 5 yo ds will sit and eat, normally, but 3 yo ds will not.  Occasionally he will and just not have what we are.  Last night ate a pint of strawberries while we had spaghetti.  Tonight he was asleep.  I do not stress food times, selection, or quantity during the day, but I don&#39;t know how to encourage him to sit with us at the table.  We do not expect them to sit for more than 5-10 minutes, but I would like it to be a habit.  His appetite is so small that anything will ruin it.  I have tried to have him wait and sit down with us, but that often doesn&#39;t work.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-492013435">Thanks again to everyone for your input...so much has made sense to me <br/>
and given me hope. My kids were utterly delighted today when I told them <br/>
they could start cooking on the stove and making their own meals if they <br/>
wanted to.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>He&#39;s 3.  That is so little.  The thing that I believe is important to you<br/>
about &quot;dinner time&quot; is that it is the mainstream &quot;family time.&quot;  In an<br/>
unschooling household that doesn&#39;t have to be that way.  As he gets older<br/>
and he sees those that want to sit at the table enjoying a family activity<br/>
he may sit with you at the table.  He might not.  He might eat with you and<br/>
again he might not.  Forcing him there even for 5 or 10 minutes may be very<br/>
difficult for him.  If being together as a family is important then find<br/>
other ways that you can do that at other times.  It doesn&#39;t have to be at<br/>
meal time.<br/>
<br/>
And maybe I&#39;ll beat Ren to this :) but isn&#39;t eating *anything* &quot;ruining your<br/>
appetite?&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1301378771">Our three yo sits long enough to play in the food and run. We do plan  <br/>
a family meal time, i make one big meal with several options. Almost  <br/>
every meal is one that the majority likes. Those who don&#39;t like it  <br/>
are free to make something else.<br/>
<br/>
If the goal is just to get the kid at the table, not about eating,  <br/>
then toys, coloring, books, are all options for home, just like  <br/>
they&#39;d be at a restaurant. Something that we have done...when we got  <br/>
our new table, we took the old one and cut about six inches off of  <br/>
it. So that table is also in our dining room, and it has thomas legos  <br/>
on it, and there&#39;s also a pile of baby toys beside it so that the  <br/>
little ones can get down and play.We usually all come to the table,  <br/>
say a blessing, share out what we want, and then the meal is really  <br/>
about being together because daddy just got home from work. The  <br/>
little ones are still in the area and part of the discussion.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1881878764">&lt;I have a food question: How do you let the children choose their food, and<br/>
still sit down to dinner together.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
One way would be to have dinner when the kids are hungry and join them.  But<br/>
I think more importantly, why do you feel the need to eat dinner together<br/>
every day?  All those studies done on families who eat dinner together<br/>
getting better grades, doing less drugs, or what-have-you are based on<br/>
schooled kids who have limited time to spend talking with their parents. It<br/>
is the kids who have some type of connection and communication with their<br/>
parents who are less apt to do drugs as an escape and who are more apt to<br/>
work hard for good grades because their parents value it and they know that.<br/>
As an unschooled family we spend TONS of time together.  We connect in<br/>
various ways through out the day.  I listen to my kids while we play a game<br/>
or groom our horses or watch TV.  Dinner time isn&#39;t the only time we come<br/>
face to face and talk and connect. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The reason that I write this is because I too felt the need to have family<br/>
dinners and have everyone sit down at one point.  I think it was those<br/>
studies lurking somewhere in my head combined with the importance my family<br/>
or origin placed on dinner time.  I didn&#39;t stop to think that those things<br/>
didn&#39;t apply to my family and I stressed a lot about it.   When I let that<br/>
go and stopped worrying about who ate what at what time and if they&#39;d be<br/>
hungry for dinner, it made my home a more joyful place.  When I cook dinner<br/>
most often everyone sits down to eat it.  Sometimes they don&#39;t and that&#39;s<br/>
ok.  If they were busy on the computer someone might take theirs in to the<br/>
computer room to eat.  Sometimes I will too and sometimes one of the kids<br/>
will ask me to eat with them.  I always do if they want to.  I put the left<br/>
overs in the fridge and I&#39;ll happily get some for anyone who wants some<br/>
later on.  (if I am not exhausted and heading up to bed.sometimes then I do<br/>
it a little grumpily, but I&#39;m working on that.)<br/>
