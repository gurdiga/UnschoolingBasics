 </span></blockquote>DK has a colorful fun book of holidays around the world (I picked <br/>
mine up for 50 cents or $1 at a tag sale!) including winter-time <br/>
celebrations around the world. All are told from a child&#39;s <br/>
perspective - what they wear, what they eat, etc.<br/>
<br/>
There aren&#39;t &#39;many&#39; religions that celebrate winter solstice - <br/>
Christmas isn&#39;t actually about winter solstice (although many of the <br/>
customs were appended from solstice celebrations and given Christian <br/>
symbolism, syncretism at its finest). Judaism doesn&#39;t have a <br/>
solstice celebration (Hanukkah isn&#39;t really &#39;up there&#39; in religious <br/>
importance except for how it&#39;s been hyped to match up with <br/>
Christmas). Neither does Islam as far as I know. Buddhism, as far as <br/>
I know, doesn&#39;t really have any &#39;celebrations&#39; as such (since it is <br/>
more a philosophy than a &#39;religion&#39;). Earth-based belief systems <br/>
celebrate solstice but they tend not to fit easily into <br/>
definable &#39;religions&#39; as much. They are belief systems with the <br/>
participant/practitioner choosing which beliefs and practices they <br/>
want to follow, emphaize, etc.<br/>

belief system)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-886594853">I second Deb&#39;s suggestion of the DK books. I think it&#39;s <br/>
called &quot;Children just like me&quot; or something? We have two of them, one <br/>
talks about regular life, the other is &quot;celebrations around the world&quot; <br/>
(??not sure??) and touches on the major holiday of several cultures.<br/>
<br/>
I have the most fun when involving food while I&#39;m learning about a <br/>
culture. If your kids like that, cook something from each country when <br/>
you read about it. You could even make something ahead of time and <br/>
have it casually available. <br/>
<br/>
I also love checking ebay for import stuff...it&#39;s really fun to have <br/>
some coins or smallish objects from a country you&#39;re interested in. <br/>
You could get some little items that are used in each celebration.<br/>

  Hey, Ren!<br/>
   <br/>
  Love this idea...something I hadn&#39;t thought of before!  And I&#39;ve found *so many* inexpensive treasures on eBay, but never searched for items from different countries.<br/>
   <br/>
  Thanks for this suggestion!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Our religion doesn&#39;t celebrate it, but my husband&#39;s culture does and  <br/>
it is the kids&#39; absolutely most favorite day/night of the year.<br/>
<br/>
We have a fire in the fireplace, we bring blankets and pillows out in  <br/>
the living room, we light candles all over the room. We have Persian  <br/>
folk music playing softly in the background. We have all kinds of  <br/>
traditional things to eat - dried fruits, nuts and seeds, especially,  <br/>
but also Persian cookies and always some fresh melon. We play cards  <br/>
sometimes, early in the evening. Then we get out all our books of  <br/>
Persian legends and folk tales and we read aloud from them. I always  <br/>
have some kind of crafty thing to do that is related to either the  <br/>
winter season, the sun, or Persian culture. For example, we painted  <br/>
Persian miniatures one year, we&#39;ve made candles, we&#39;ve cut fancy  <br/>
snowflakes....last year we made mosaic stepping stones (Persians are  <br/>
famous for their mosaic work).  Late in the evening we bake potatoes  <br/>
in the fireplace - often we roast chestnuts.<br/>
<br/>
Writing it down, it doesn&#39;t sound that exciting - most of it is my  <br/>
husband reading or telling stories, really.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody goes off to bed - they just fall asleep all cuddled up there  <br/>
in front of the fire. Sometimes we stay up all night - that&#39;s always  <br/>
the plan! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
