<div id="ygrps-yiv-778498906">One of the things that excites me about unschooling is the possibility that *I* <br/>
will have the time to explore some of my own interests!  I feel like I have been <br/>
as stressed and oppressed as my kids...and I am currently &quot;deschooling&quot; along <br/>
with them...acting as if I am on summer break!  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But I am wondering how to find balance in my days...between childcare, <br/>
unschooling, home care, and a part-time job...???<br/>
<br/>
How do you pursue your passions and interests while still meeting <br/>
responsibilities?<br/>
<br/>
(Maybe I shouldn&#39;t be worrying about this yet?)<br/>
<br/>
As a side note - I have noticed that since I am not requiring my kids to do jobs <br/>
and chores around the house, that they are more willing to help out.  It seems <br/>
so opposite!  But just last night, my 10 yo, who we have always considered the <br/>
&quot;lazy&quot; one, saw me picking up the living room and said, &quot;I&#39;ll do that, mom&quot; and <br/>
did it.  I about fell over!!!<br/>
<br/>
I hope I really can get the hang of this...I think unschooling will be good for <br/>
all of us!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>For now, it can help a whole lot to see your family as One of your passions! That way you&#39;re not putting passions aside for obligations, but choosing between things which give you joy and fulfillment. There Are natural limits, after all, and the 24-hour day is one of them!<br/>
<br/>
It also helps to think about learning and growing - neither are straightforward and linear, but move forward and swirl around, form eddies and backwaters, stall and sometimes stagnate for a time before rushing onward. So its okay if some passions are sitting in a little backwater, resting for now. Everything you&#39;re learning and doing Now will contribute to your future growing and learning in small ways you can&#39;t possibly predict. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1559967182">One of the reasons I chose home schooling was for just this reason.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I feel that we have more balance in our days. This balance includes <br/>
time for me, too. Granted, much of &quot;my time&quot; is at the gym, and I&#39;ve had <br/>
to make peace with the child care provided there. When I reflected on <br/>
the child care, I realized there were many positives: my kids get to <br/>
hang out with other children from different cultures - and this is their <br/>
primary opportunity for experiencing diversity these days. Also, the <br/>
caregiver is from an entirely different culture, which is great for my <br/>
girls to experience, too.<br/>
<br/>
The kids spent a LOT of time with their dad (my husband, too!) on <br/>
weeknights and weekends. I&#39;m grateful that my husband has adjusted to <br/>
this over time, b/c I really needed some time to regroup and <br/>
re-energize. We both realize that we need time away in order to bring <br/>
our best to the family....<br/>
<br/>
Re: responsibilities other than the kids, we&#39;re still working that part <br/>
out. Domestic chores definitely take a hit. I  do the dishes and a <br/>
couple of loads of wash each day, and try to pick up the clutter as we <br/>
go along.  As for the rest, it either gets left for &quot;tomorrow,&quot; or one <br/>
of us has a burst of energy or inspiration and does the job.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that helps? At least to know that you have support here!<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Linda</div>
