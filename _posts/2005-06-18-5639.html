<div id="ygrps-yiv-127490323">My husband and I recently decided on an unschooling approach after <br/>
our 11yo son left ps in March. I am reading the literature and am on <br/>
several lists. This certainly seems right for our family. My son is <br/>
happy. My husband is convinced. Yet I remain fairly anxious. As I am <br/>
contending with my own deschooling and rethinking what seemed like my <br/>
own positive experience with education, I contend with people outside <br/>
of the homeschooling community and their responses to our choice. I <br/>
thought I would put out two of the responses I received thatlingered <br/>
in my mind. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(1)The first was from (of all people) my mother. Of the concerns she <br/>
raised, the one that I have thought about the most is the idea that <br/>
we are just making things too easy for our son by dropping out of the <br/>
education track. (These seems to be a refrain in her general worry <br/>
about other aspects of our parenting approach: such as not <br/>
circumcizing our son, not restrictng his food, not forcing him to <br/>
play sports.)<br/>
<br/>
(2)The other response to our ourschooling decision came from an <br/>
acquaintance who is in a high management position in business. Her <br/>
emphasis was that children like all people need to have expectations <br/>
set of them. She feels that unless high expectations are set, people <br/>
do not try to do well.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to hear what other people might reply to these concerns <br/>
as well as any suggestons for articles or books. I think that my <br/>
concern is not just about how to respond to people&#39;s criticisms but <br/>
how to address those cultural influences that remain voices inside of <br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
I live in PA where there aren&#39;t many true unschoolers and could use <br/>
some assistance.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
Does she really want you to make things hard for your son?  That seems really mean to me.  Kind of like hazing.....I had to endure 12 years of boredom and by the Gods, you will too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;expectations&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I do have expectations of my kids.  I expect them to be kind and loving.  I expect them to be &quot;rotten&quot; at times.  I expect them to find things to do that set them on fire and I expect them to expect me to support them in that.  I expect them to have periods where all they want to do is stare at a wall and contemplate the universe.<br/>
<br/>
I expect them to be fully human, not a puppy trained to sit quietly and respond on cue.<br/>

  Hi Andrea<br/>
<br/>
  is the idea that <br/>
  we are just making things too easy for our son by dropping out of the <br/>
  education track. (These seems to be a refrain in her general worry <br/>
  about other aspects of our parenting approach: such as not <br/>
  circumcizing our son, not restrictng his food, not forcing him to <br/>
  play sports.)<br/>
<br/>
  The education track is what school says it is and for that reason is probably irrelevant to your son and has nothing to do with learning in my opinion. Other issues are your own private business - as his how your child learns -  and nothing to do with your mother tbh.  My mother had similar concerns to.lol<br/>
<br/>
  In response to child need expectations set on them well I can only comment on my own personal family but my eldest son has been unschooled for 4 years and has decided off his own back to apply for a online university place and has just been offered one two years ahead of age time.  I have never pressured him this route or pushed or taught him. He did it himself.  I think the opposite is true. Setting expectations can cause untold stress and pressure and it is up to the individual child how they want to learn and what.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-347305297">Hi Andrea!  It is so hard when you are new at this and people come in  to <br/>
challenge you.  Hang in there!  I&#39;ve been unschooling for three  years, have a <br/>
great support, and the other night I panicked.  My kids will  never do (fill in <br/>
the blank) if I unschool!<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s normal.  And even worse when people you love and admire are  questioning <br/>
you.<br/>
 <br/>
First, remember they aren&#39;t you nor have they had your experiences or  <br/>
benefits of your research.  They certainly aren&#39;t the mother of *your*  child.  Some <br/>
of my best understanding about unschooling came long before I  knew there was <br/>
such a thing.  These experiences are a part of who I am, and  when I found <br/>
out about unschooling, all those random experiences joined together  and made <br/>
sense to me.  Not a single person on this list, can share those  same <br/>
experiences in the same way, so how could someone who doesn&#39;t *get*  unschooling even <br/>
begin to see my point of view?<br/>
 <br/>
So, when someone out there is giving you their opinion, that is exactly  what <br/>
it is....an opinion.  A commonly held one, yes, but it is still an  opinion.<br/>
 <br/>
As for things being &quot;too easy&quot;, that is exactly what you are doing!  I  want <br/>
it to BE EASY for my children to learn.  I call it the &quot;optimal brain&quot;  <br/>
learning system.  You are releasing your child from all the boredom,  competition, <br/>
stress, anxiety, and personal sacrifice (you can&#39;t eat when you are  hungry, <br/>
sleep when you are tired, go to the toilet, etc.) that goes along with  school.  <br/>
That makes it HARD to learn.  Add to that, having to read  when you want to <br/>
play, play when you want to read, do math when you weren&#39;t done  with science <br/>
and it is amazing to me that kids learn in school at all.<br/>
 <br/>
But that&#39;s the point.  Kids learn.  Period.  If the human  brain didn&#39;t <br/>
learn, our species wouldn&#39;t be here.  Why confuse something  that is one of the <br/>
most basic of human functions?  Why wouldn&#39;t I give my  child the world and say <br/>
&quot;go forth and learn&quot; instead of locking (yes, locking)  him away in a building <br/>
with lots of enforced rules about how, why, when, what he  learns?<br/>
 <br/>
School is like that game show they had on Comedy Central  (Distraction???).  <br/>
They would ask people simple questions but would be  doing something so <br/>
distracting to them, it was really hard for them to  answer.  Things like going <br/>
&quot;lalalalalalalalalalalalala&quot; in their ear.  <br/>
 <br/>
******(2)The other response to our ourschooling decision came from an  <br/>
acquaintance who is in a high management position in business. Her  <br/>
emphasis was that children like all people need to have expectations <br/>
set  of them. She feels that unless high expectations are set, people <br/>
do not try  to do well.**********<br/>
 <br/>
First of all, your friend may have lots of experience with SCHOOLED people  <br/>
that don&#39;t do well unless they have expectation placed on them.  I&#39;m quite  <br/>
sure she doesn&#39;t know any unschooled people.  And I doubt an unschooler  would <br/>
want to work in such an environment anyway.<br/>
 <br/>
There was a book a couple of years ago (can someone help me?  ack)  that <br/>
discussed that the future of business would be the free agent, not the  corporate <br/>
guy.  He compared the homeschooling community to this new  spirit of business. <br/>
 This book received high praise.  I believe  it....I think the age of the <br/>
giant corporation is fading.  They can&#39;t  support themselves and their inflated <br/>
budgets.  We need innovators and  people who know how to work for themselves, <br/>
not people that know only how to do  what they are told.<br/>
 <br/>
My children are relatively young, but I am amazed at the expectations they  <br/>
have for themselves.  They decide they want to do something and they set up  <br/>
parameters and work and work.  If things aren&#39;t going as planned, they  change <br/>
their parameters or revisit it later with new info. or skills or  scrap the <br/>
project.  There are moments of frustration, but no one is shaming  them or <br/>
grading them or expecting more from them.  Their self-esteem is in  one piece and <br/>
they move on to the next idea they have dreamed up.  <br/>
 <br/>
Life has a way of moving you on.  As soon as you have risen to one  <br/>
challenge, another presents itself.  A childhood of happily moving  from challenge to <br/>
challenge, and getting to choose most of them (some things,  like illness, are <br/>
beyond our control), will result in a person who will meet  adulthood in the <br/>
same manner.  On their own terms and to their own  satisfaction.<br/>
 <br/>
A person who has expectations set for them, will spend their life stressing  <br/>
over meeting or exceeding these expectations and always with other people in  <br/>
mind.  That is a life lived for others, and that person&#39;s happiness  will  <br/>
depend on what someone else thinks of them.  And the title  beneath his name <br/>
might hold more importance than who he is as a  person.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1816334775">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; (1)The first was from (of all people) my mother. Of the concerns she <br/>
raised, the one that I have thought about the most is the idea that <br/>
we are just making things too easy for our son by dropping out of the <br/>
education track. (These seems to be a refrain in her general worry <br/>
about other aspects of our parenting approach: such as not <br/>
circumcizing our son, not restrictng his food, not forcing him to <br/>
play sports.) &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I got the idea that most people consider circumcising a way to make it<br/>
*easier* for boys as they grow up - by being the same as other boys around<br/>
them and for ease of hygiene (which I understand to be a myth), so it is<br/>
surprising to hear not doing that it is &quot;making his life too easy&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I would suspect that your mother will probably come to see that your son is<br/>
setting his own goals, and choosing challenges of increasing complexity over<br/>
time. <br/>
<br/>
It is tempting to start trying to point out areas where our chosen life<br/>
might be harder to follow than a conventional one, especially in the areas<br/>
of being different or fitting in, or our kids growing up to be people who<br/>
take the harder road of taking responsibility for themselves instead of<br/>
being followers.<br/>
<br/>
However this broader idea that we as parents should be trying to make life<br/>
difficult for our children because life itself is &quot;not easy&quot; is worth<br/>
examining. It is also worth asking other people to examine why they are<br/>
saying &quot;life should be hard&quot;, to force *them* to really think it over.<br/>
<br/>
It is fairly illogical that *if* life is tough, we should therefore make it<br/>
even tougher. I believe that I can trust the economy, the unpredictability<br/>
of our neighbors or professional colleagues, the weather, our powerlessness<br/>
over other people, the unlucky chance that leaves a nail in my driveway, and<br/>
so on, to provide enough challenges in real life without me having to make<br/>
up extra troubles. Being out of school will not remove these life<br/>
challenges, just the school based ones which are contrived.<br/>
<br/>
I also believe that our homes can and should be a haven from the<br/>
tribulations of the world, especially for our children as they learn to cope<br/>
with their own development as well as learn about life. I don&#39;t have to<br/>
break Jayn&#39;s finger to give her experience in coping with pain in case she<br/>
breaks her arm one day - I would rather help her keep her fingers safe.<br/>
<br/>
I also don&#39;t want her to think of her home life as something she will<br/>
eventually be able to escape from, which I believe is a prevalent attitude<br/>
amongst conventionally schooled and parented children. I have a couple of<br/>
little neighbors who, at the ages of 7 and 5, are already trying to escape<br/>
over here as often as possible.<br/>
<br/>
But aside from that I believe that the idea that life *should* be hard, that<br/>
suffering is ennobling, is erroneous - a mythic paradigm stemming from some<br/>
religions, and a jolly good excuse to not help people in poverty or trouble.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I prefer to live with the paradigm that although life sometimes has<br/>
challenges, our true selves and our higher nature lie in the pursuit of<br/>
happiness. Certainly tragedies occur, people do have real and serious<br/>
problems, and hubris makes great drama. However a life of joy is not an<br/>
earned reward, but a philosophical choice. And if troubles lie around the<br/>
corner for our kids, at least we can give them as much joy now so that they<br/>
face these troubles from a place of strength and love. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;(2)The other response to our ourschooling decision came from an <br/>
acquaintance who is in a high management position in business. Her <br/>
emphasis was that children like all people need to have expectations <br/>
set of them. She feels that unless high expectations are set, people <br/>
do not try to do well.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Try &quot;Punished by Rewards&quot; by Alfie Kohn, and his latest &quot;Unconditional<br/>
Parenting&quot;. He also has a number of articles at his website that summarize<br/>
his ideas. www.alfiekohn.org<br/>
<br/>
Having expectations of others can be a swift path to disappointments and<br/>
resentments.<br/>
<br/>
The self chosen self-expectations that our free children devise are probably<br/>
higher than any external ones. <br/>
<br/>
The expectations that I have of Jayn are that she will pursue her interests,<br/>
express her needs and continue to grow at exactly the right pace for<br/>
herself. Her discoveries and development continue to blow me away with her<br/>
cleverness and creativity.<br/>

Leslie,<br/>
I always enjoy your posts (I&#39;m keeping this one in my &quot;inspiration&quot; <br/>
file).  Since I don&#39;t post often, I like to remind others of our <br/>
sitation.  My dd is 12, wanted to try middle school this year, we&#39;ll <br/>
be homeschooling/unschooling for the first time this fall.  We&#39;re <br/>
BOTH going to have to do a lot of deschooling.  I struggle <br/>
constantly with the change.  I KNOW it&#39;s what&#39;s right for my <br/>
daughter, but I also know it will take a lot of time to get there, <br/>
to make such huge changes to our lifestyle.  I have always worked <br/>
full time, this is the first time I will be home.<br/>
<br/>
Andrea, keep reading, asking questions, and take it one day at a <br/>
time.  Trust your heart and that you know what is best for your <br/>
child and family.  Don&#39;t worry about what others who don&#39;t <br/>
understand think.  When I started researching homeschooling a little <br/>
over 2 years ago, I had never heard of unschooling.  I also never <br/>
thought I&#39;d be able to homeschool my child.  It&#39;s amazing how <br/>
differently I view that now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2078666238">*****My dd is 12, wanted to try middle school this year, we&#39;ll <br/>
be  homeschooling/unschooling for the first time this fall.  We&#39;re <br/>
BOTH  going to have to do a lot of deschooling.  I struggle <br/>
constantly with  the change.  I KNOW it&#39;s what&#39;s right for my <br/>
daughter, but I also know  it will take a lot of time to get there, <br/>
to make such huge changes to our  lifestyle.  I have always worked <br/>
full time, this is the first time I  will be home.*****<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lots of changes!    Go easy on yourself if you are both  feeling a little <br/>
overwhelmed, any one of those changes is a big deal.   Sometimes I think becoming <br/>
an unschooler is a bit like converting to a  completely different religion <br/>
than the one you were raised in.  I bet you  would have to do such a radical <br/>
shift in thinking and keep reminding yourself  what you are &quot;supposed&quot; to think!  <br/>
Have fun, Jann (and Andrea!)<br/>
 <br/>

****Leslie,<br/>
I always enjoy your posts (I&#39;m keeping this one in my  &quot;inspiration&quot; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1691034777">Hey Leslie,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Sometimes I think becoming an unschooler is a bit like converting to a<br/>
completely different religion <br/>
than the one you were raised in.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When I tell the story of how we came to unschooling, this is what I compare<br/>
it to.  In 2000, the topic of homeschooling our kids had just come up.  I<br/>
was sure &quot;I&quot; could/would never homeschool (although I was impressed with<br/>
those families who did h/sh) because (1) I supported public education - in<br/>
theory, (2) I wasn&#39;t organized enough, and... I&#39;m sure there were other<br/>
reasons at the time. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Then we went to a revival - otherwise known as the &quot;Rethinking Education&quot;<br/>
conference in Dallas.  LOL!  And we - dh & I -  were 100 percent converted!<br/>
I went in thinking &quot;I could never h/school&quot; and came out saying &quot;we never<br/>
want to put our kids in school!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I recommend making the trek to an unschooling conference &lt;g&gt;!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>

Hoping to make it to live & learn in Oct<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-686855478">Hi Andrea<br/>
<br/>
is the idea that <br/>
we are just making things too easy for our son by dropping out of the <br/>
education track. (These seems to be a refrain in her general worry <br/>
about other aspects of our parenting approach: such as not <br/>
circumcizing our son, not restrictng his food, not forcing him to <br/>
play sports.)<br/>
<br/>
The education track is what school says it is and for that reason is probably irrelevant to your son and has nothing to do with learning in my opinion. Other issues are your own private business - as his how your child learns -  and nothing to do with your mother tbh.  My mother had similar concerns to.lol<br/>
<br/>
In response to child need expectations set on them well I can only comment on my own personal family but my eldest son has been unschooled for 4 years and has decided off his own back to apply for a online university place and has just been offered one two years ahead of age time.  I have never pressured him this route or pushed or taught him. He did it himself.  I think the opposite is true. Setting expectations can cause untold stress and pressure and it is up to the individual child how they want to learn and what.  <br/>

I enjoyed reading this article, despite some assertions about the history of<br/>
schooling and legality that may be debatable. *Some* of his info reads like<br/>
it came from an HSLDA promo.<br/>
<br/>
I think my favorite line is:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Freedom isn&#39;t a detour from learning. It&#39;s the best pathway toward it.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
This is especially good to counter the notion that I have heard from some<br/>
anti-unschoolers that what we do is &quot;Freedom instead of Education.&quot;<br/>

surgery a week ago, it&#39;s going to be slower than I thought.  But <br/>
that&#39;s OK, I&#39;m off of work for the first time in a very long time, <br/>
and will be giving my notice in another week or 2 (as soon as I get <br/>
my final pay check), so most of my energy is on that right now, and <br/>
the last few days of school (fortunately, all the projects are done <br/>
and probably no more homework).  I know it will take time to truly <br/>
feel we&#39;re in a different life style. So now, I&#39;m trying to nap, <br/>
heal my foot and destress as much as possible, although it&#39;s hard to <br/>
have to sit with my foot up (as much reading as I have to do, <br/>
because it&#39;s on my list of what I want to do, I can&#39;t seem to get <br/>
into right now).  That&#39;s OK, there&#39;s time!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-551476283">Me too; the support and feedback was helpful. I read a few good articles: the Alfie Kohn piece on How Not to Get Into College. Also his Suppernanny critique in which he lambasts the superficial focus on behavior and behaviorist solutions to parenting. <br/>
<br/>
I also did some thinking about my ongoing sense that it the relationship with one&#39;s child that has to be the overarching guide. It&#39;s really a rejection of that relationship and of one&#39;s child to be more loyal to cultural expect ions and all the anxiety they generate. <br/>
<br/>
I also liked someone&#39;s idea that adopting an unschooling philosophy is like changing your religion. I feel in a better spirit to take this on.<br/>
<br/>
This Father&#39;s Day highlighted these issues for me. There are my connections to my father a link with the old ways of my upbringing and  to my husband with whom who I have the continuing chance to create a new way of life.<br/>

I guess the first thing that started to change my mind was reading <br/>
about all the negative feelings and results of parents and teachers <br/>
having expectations about what should be learned when. I can sit back <br/>
and think, yes, I remember how bad I felt when I didn&#39;t live up to <br/>
expectations and how the good I felt was so fragile. I&#39;ve always been <br/>
very dependent on other people&#39;s praise, and that has been far from a <br/>
healthy thing. Especially when it comes to learning, it&#39;s such a great <br/>
feeling to learn something because you want to.<br/>

expectations you might have about your child going to college, for <br/>
example. Over the next few months you&#39;ll see him learning. That will <br/>
encourage you. Then you&#39;ll see more and be more encouraged. It grows <br/>
on you slowly.<br/>
<br/>
I was watching my ds (4.5) play a Magic Schoolbus computer game the <br/>
other day. It&#39;s called &quot;Inside the Earth&quot; and instead of playing one <br/>
of the games in it, he was listening to the &quot;reports&quot; about volcanos <br/>
and other things. It struck me funny, like why would someone want to <br/>
listen to a lesson instead of playing a game? A very schoolish thought <br/>
on my part...I choose to learn quite often, why would he be any <br/>
different??<br/>
