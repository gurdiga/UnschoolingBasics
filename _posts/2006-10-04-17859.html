<div id="ygrps-yiv-1144527728">I&#39;ve recently been accused of being an idealist in a recent <br/>
discusson about unschooling my daughters.  No one ever seemed to <br/>
doubt my ability to homeschool - I guess because I was doing &#39;school <br/>
at home&#39; but now my critics say that I&#39;m being too idealistic and my <br/>
children will suffer because of it.<br/>
<br/>
Are unschoolers really more idealistic than others when it comes to <br/>
creating a different/better way in dealing with our children and <br/>
their learning/growing?  <br/>
<br/>
I never thought that being idealistic was a bad thing, but I&#39;m <br/>
having some doubts.  It (radical unschool) is much harder than <br/>
reward/punishment system I used to use.  Unschooling is much more <br/>
enjoyable than &#39;school at home&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Do you ever doubt yourself?  How do you deal with critics who claim <br/>
you are too much of an idealist and you are damaging your children <br/>
because they won&#39;t be able to live in the real world?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
Idealism is a positive thing, is it not?  I think so.<br/>
<br/>
What I personally do is limit what I share with others.  I guess I <br/>
pick and choose what I say, and to whom I say it, very carefully.  I <br/>
think we get excited and want to share it (unschooling and the <br/>
freedom found there) with everyone, because how could they not want <br/>
to be free?  In our enthusiasm and zest for a peaceful life we tend <br/>
to forget that most of the people in our everyday lives don&#39;t think <br/>
outside the box.<br/>
<br/>
In order to keep focused and centered I keep my ideas to myself and <br/>
share little bits here and there.  It seems to be more effective <br/>
that way anyhow.  Most people don&#39;t seem to be too open to <br/>
alternative ways of thinking especially when it comes to education.  <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t get me wrong.  I do have discussions here and there about <br/>
simple living, mindful parenting and unschooling.  I just watch my <br/>
words very carefully and make sure I am up to the challenge before I <br/>
say &quot;too much&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
If I find myself getting frustrated or discouraged or I am <br/>
questioning myself in any way related to unschooling and the <br/>
decisions I have made for myself and my family I come here.  I read <br/>
the blogs of like minded people.  I signed up for Scott Noelle&#39;s <br/>
Daily Groove email list.  I read it daily.  I submerge myself in <br/>
reassuring information.  I stay centered.  I look at my children and <br/>
see the self-confident, independent, beautifully free young people <br/>
that they are.  <br/>
<br/>
Look, listen, observe, interact, live, know, be...  <br/>

 <br/>
Unfortunately, Cara, I don&#39;t have much advise for you but I do have  the same <br/>
problem.  As a matter of fact, that could be my &quot;theme&quot; this  year!  I almost <br/>
expect to have a new TV show on this season called  &quot;Leslie, Your Kids Will <br/>
Never Be Able to Live in the Real World!&quot;  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I did almost look for a hidden camera when I was accused of overprotecting  <br/>
my kids by using unscented laundry detergent. (I&#39;m not kidding!)<br/>
 <br/>
I do know just as many people who are settled and successful and able to  <br/>
deal with the real world that were &quot;pampered&quot; kids as I do people that had a  <br/>
harsher childhood.    How many people do you know that had  all the right stuff <br/>
but just never got the right breaks?  Or people  that had everything and then <br/>
lost it?  There are some people that are  happy with very little and some that <br/>
are never happy no  matter what. Some people survive disasters perfectly fine, <br/>
some cannot  get over the trauma.  Some people get all the breaks and never <br/>
really have  to work hard at anything.<br/>
 <br/>
You cannot predict the future or success or even happiness. Maybe a  good <br/>
portion of successful and/or happy adulthood is luck and timing.   I do I feel it <br/>
is important to give my kids as much opportunity for  self-esteem and <br/>
self-knowledge as possible, and the best way I know to  accomplish this is <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
 <br/>
I also find the &quot;real world&quot; plays a big part of our daily lives, good and  <br/>
bad, regardless of how idealistic I am.  :)<br/>

<br/>
I think it&#39;s the parents who send their kids to school who are the <br/>
idealists. Just think: sending your babies off to a building where they <br/>
will be taught by strangers. They&#39;ll be taught everything they&#39;ll ever <br/>
need to know----all in that building. And some other strangers in <br/>
government get to decide what those things are---without ever meeting <br/>
the children! And they all get to do the same things! At the same time! <br/>
By following this tradition, all graduates should be rich, handsome, <br/>
and famous! In the &quot;real&quot; world.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s true idealism! And damaging.<br/>
<br/>
I prefer to think of myself as a realist. Exposing children to as many <br/>
different things, people, situations, locations, and ideas ensures that <br/>
they will KEEP living in the real world.<br/>
<br/>
No, I don&#39;t doubt myself. It just makes too much sense!<br/>

And is doesn&#39;t just *feel* unreal---it IS. School is NOT  the &quot;real <br/>
world&quot;---its a building in which teachers and administrators try to <br/>
simulate the real world. ANd not very well either!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1690649350">It makes me CRAZY when people talk about putting their kids in situations to get them used to the &quot;real world&quot;.  There is no 1 &quot;real world&quot;,  people who live in different situations, based on socioeconomic level as an example, would hardly ever cross paths.  An adult&#39;s &quot;real world&quot;  is based on their job, their interests, their kids, etc.  and if they choose they could stay in that little bubble.  To me unschooling enables children to build up an intact self-esteem, and try out interests feeling safe in the knowledge that they can back out at any time.  As they grow more confident and CHOOSE to try out other outside activities they grow and expand interests and their &quot;real world&quot;.   <br/>
