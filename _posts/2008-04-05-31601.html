<div id="ygrps-yiv-232307081">I&#39;m just wondering if anyone on here has had a child with dyslexia and as an unschooler how you have dealt with it.  We have a child (he&#39;s 7) we are pretty sure has it and we trying very hard to not allow him to be pinned with that as a label.  He wants desperately to read well and is trying (not with me pushing him), but he gets so deeply frustrated with it and cries.  I am finding myself worrying that if we don&#39;t find some resolve soon, he is going to be too frustrated and give up.  I know in time he will want to read, but my husband has struggled with it most of his life and has just in the last 10 years become a strong reader.  I want to offer our child help early on so that he can enjoy the world of books fully.  I know there are plenty of other ways out there for him to learn things and I can fully embrace that as I already do, but he WANTS to read and read well, so I&#39;m looking for ideas on strategies to help him in an unschooling manner...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

There are parts of his brain that are still growing. Some people&#39;s  <br/>
brains grow in the area that is used for reading at around 6 to 8  <br/>
years old, but for some people that happens earlier and some later.  <br/>
Tell him you can help him with other ways to enjoy books while he&#39;s  <br/>
waiting for his brain to grow. For example, you can get him an ipod  <br/>
and sign him up for audible.com so he can download books to listen to.  <br/>
Reassure him that his brain is growing in other skills, right now,<br/>
<br/>
My youngest daughter wanted to read and write in the worst way - she  <br/>
had two older sisters who read very young and were big readers and  <br/>
writers and she was really really suffering because reading wasn&#39;t  <br/>
coming quickly or easily to her. She&#39;s a very different kind of kid  <br/>
than they are - she&#39;s very physical - athletic. In dance classes she  <br/>
can&#39;t understand how it can take so long for other people to remember  <br/>
the steps and she can&#39;t understand how they can forget them once they  <br/>
know them.<br/>
<br/>
It helped her a lot that I was totally calm and confident about her  <br/>
reading. I knew her brain was working in a different way than her  <br/>
sisters&#39; brains had, and I could see it was going to take longer for  <br/>
her to work out how to read, but I knew she&#39;d do it eventually.<br/>
<br/>
When she was upset about it, I comforted her and talked to her about  <br/>
the things she COULD do.<br/>
<br/>
I think if you&#39;re &quot;working with him,&quot; you might be making it worse for  <br/>
him. If he&#39;s just really not ready, then the work you&#39;re doing with  <br/>
him is fruitless and bound to be frustrating.<br/>

you reading to him.  It may look like getting books on tape.  It may <br/>
look like just not being so tense yourself about the whole subject of <br/>
reading.  Instead of the more traditional route where you are filled <br/>
with limiting thoughts like, well I think he&#39;s dyslexic and my <br/>

In your post, it sounds like your son _is_ reading but is just not <br/>
reading well.  Did I understand this correctly?  If so, who gets to <br/>
decide what reading well looks like?  Him? You? Your husband? Friends?<br/>
In other words, what factors are really playing into his <br/>
frustrations?  Babies begin talking with babbling?  Do we label them <br/>
poor speakers? No, of course not.  We accept that as a natural <br/>
progression of gaining speech.  Maybe you can help him understand <br/>
that learning to read is naturally messy and takes time.  When his <br/>
brain is ready, he WILL read.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1190910206">I think maybe I came across as sounding like I want him to be reading and reading well right now - that is not what I am saying.  I am actually very comfortable with the idea that his brain may not be ready and we are trying very hard to not hit him with this label yet until we know for sure.  That being said, he CAN read and he actually reads somewhat well, but he told us that the letters get all jumbled and that they look backwards to him (this was completely unprovoked) and that his eyes hurt - all signs of dyslexia - and this is what is frustrating him.  Dyslexia is a condition of the brain it isn&#39;t something one can outgrow it is something they have to work very hard at controlling and I&#39;m not stressed about it, I just was looking for suggestions from folks who may have dealt with it through homeschooling.<br/>

with a label?   If he is noticing jumbling letters and eye strain, it <br/>
sounds like you have something right NOW that you can do to ease <br/>
this.  This is good news, you can begin immediately to address his <br/>
needs  the label is secondary  there is no need for any heaviness <br/>
in it either.  So what can you do to ease his eye strain?  What can <br/>
you do to reduce letters getting jumbled?  You and he can work <br/>
together to find options.  You can involve him along the way as you <br/>
explore things that will help.  It may look like getting special <br/>
lenses or finding a good developmental optometrist.  It may look like <br/>
incorporating the Davis method.  Or, any number of things that may be <br/>
at your disposal.  Or, it may look like waiting until he is older, if <br/>
he feels this is best.  The more your son is involved, the more he <br/>
will become in tune with his own needs.  As he learns to be more <br/>
reflective, he will be able to guide you and let you know what is <br/>
helpful and what is not.  This type of learning, IMHO, is what makes <br/>
unschooling so profound; Kids get a chance to learn about themselves <br/>
from a very early age.<br/>
<br/>
I know that dyslexia does not just go away, I share some dyslexic <br/>
hallmarks myself.  It did not improve until I ran into some helpful <br/>
things recently in my 40s.  As a result of looking for things to help <br/>
my son, I did a type of therapy for children that helps improve <br/>
memory, reading processing, language processing, and organization <br/>
ability.  Doing the therapy for myself was incidental, but a profound <br/>
and life changing event.  I was finally able to spell and memorize <br/>
things for the first time in my life.  Yippy for me!  I was so very <br/>
happy.  Shouldn&#39;t everyone have what I got?  Well, I came to the <br/>
conclusion over time that everyone should not necessarily get what I <br/>
got.  It really depends if that person is open to it.  I concluded <br/>
that any issue a person has is less important than that person&#39;s <br/>
dignity.  I stopped doing it for children, because it was too hard <br/>
for me to see children being drug in by their parents.  I saw how the <br/>
therapy was causing a divide between the parent and the child and I <br/>
just could be part of that.  There may be a case out there where a <br/>
treatment or a therapy is more important than an individual&#39;s say in <br/>
the matter, but I haven&#39;t found it yet. <br/>
 <br/>
So my point is, don&#39;t worry so much about a heavy label.  By <br/>
following him on a need by need basis, he does not have to feel that <br/>
he is labeled, nor does he have to necessarily loose his sense of <br/>
self esteem.  Get help for your son while consulting him on the <br/>
options available along the way.  If he doesn&#39;t want to do any of it, <br/>
then that IS the right decision for him, for now.  It doesn&#39;t mean <br/>
that he won&#39;t do something in the future.  And, he may find his own <br/>
unique way of easing his eye strain or letter jumble (That&#39;s what <br/>
Davis did, with no help from anyone).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-106413169">What I want most of all is to be ABLE to help him when the time comes and he requests it.  I want to know what I need to do to help him.  I&#39;m not familiar with the Davis method as we have just started exploring this, I would love for you to elaborate there.  We haven&#39;t even talked with him about it yet just because I wanted to learn more about it myself and have a better understanding before we even mention it.  Right now, we are just chillin&#39; and going with the flow more or less.  I have a call into a local therapist that works at the college helping folks like us, just to ask some questions and see where things are and what we can do.  We are just exploring it and then when and if the time becomes necessary we can tell him, but he may never need to know if I have some resources in my pocket I can pull out to help guide him when he wants it.  My hope is that this journey will continue to bring us closer and that he will understand it&#39;s just a thing... it&#39;s no big deal... he also has a hole in his heart, but it has never been an issue that he can&#39;t play soccer or football, I don&#39;t think this will cause him any woes either.  I think he&#39;s confident enough that he won&#39;t see this as a big deal either. <br/>

There are zillions of people out there who will recommend  diagnosis  <br/>

about NOT doing enough and really want to &quot;do something.&quot;<br/>

Exactly! I am really not thrilled when people start recommending<br/>
therapies or methods of any kind for a SEVEN year old! That is amazing<br/>
to me actually. It is VERY normal for children that age to see words<br/>
and letters backwards or jumbled. Totally normal. <br/>

Not only is a label like dyslexia absolutely unecessary, it is<br/>
ridiculous because the child in question is so young! I would rather<br/>
tell you about my 14 y.o. that learned to read at 12 than to recommend<br/>
ANY method for dyslexia. <br/>
<br/>
Even people with true dyslexia learn to read just fine in an<br/>
environment where they aren&#39;t treated as someone with a &quot;problem&quot; or<br/>
&quot;learning disability&quot;. A method can&#39;t beat time and trust in my<br/>
opinion. Wait. That&#39;s my advice. In four or five years, if the child<br/>
isn&#39;t making any progress and is seeing things all jumbled, write us<br/>
again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-611754347">I read up on the Davis method just now. Here&#39;s an excerpt:<br/>
<br/>
~~Disorientation and distorted perceptions do more than create<br/>
symptoms of dyslexia. The dyslexic or A.D.D. child uses disorientation<br/>
for entertainment; he may be disoriented for hours on end creating the<br/>
imaginary world he plays in.<br/>
<br/>
What we accept as reality is what we experience. The way we realize an<br/>
experience is that we perceive it. Reality, then, is what we perceive<br/>
it to be. When disorientation occurs, perception becomes distorted. A<br/>
person who is disoriented experiences a reality that is not being<br/>
experienced by othersa false, or alternate, reality.<br/>
<br/>
Because of their frequent disorientation, many dyslexic or A.D.D.<br/>
individuals do not learn the basic lessons of life. Cause and effect<br/>
do not exist in the disorienting child&#39;s imaginary, alternate reality<br/>
world. Thus, the child never learns the concept of consequence.~~<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone else hear the sound of Supertramp&#39;s &quot;The Logical Song&quot; at<br/>
this point? Ick.<br/>
<br/>
There are times to research various therapies and understand how to<br/>
use them in an unschooling setting. I know one parent who uses them<br/>
very gently with her severely autistic children...but a 7y.o. that<br/>
can&#39;t read??? Totally unecessary.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1662439584">***am feel like my intentions<br/>
are being distorted simply because it is about reading...***<br/>
<br/>
No, you&#39;ve written things that seem to contradict. <br/>
<br/>
You wrote:<br/>
*** He wants desperately to read well and is trying (not with me pushing<br/>
him), but he gets so deeply frustrated with it and cries.***<br/>
<br/>
Then you wrote:<br/>
***That being said, he CAN read and he actually reads somewhat well,***<br/>
<br/>
I think your expectation of a seven year old learning to read is unrealistic.  I think you&#39;ve jumped to a WILD conclusion, based on your husband&#39;s experience.   If your husband went to school, your unschooled child, even if he reads later,  will not have the same experience your husband had...unless you put him in school or shame him and tag him with a label and make him feel like there&#39;s something wrong with him.   The ONLY damage that comes from later reading is the damage other people can do to the psychology of the later reader.<br/>
<br/>
 You wrote:<br/>
***I want to offer our child help early on so that he can enjoy the<br/>
world of books fully. ***<br/>
<br/>
Then you wrote:<br/>
***I am actually very comfortable with the idea that his brain may not be ready ***<br/>
<br/>
Are you wanting to intervene or are you ok with letting learning happen naturally?    We&#39;re not distorting your intentions you seem to not know what your intentions are. <br/>
<br/>
There is NO reason a person who can&#39;t read well yet can&#39;t enjoy books.  You can read to him.  You can get him books on CD and listen with him.  <br/>
<br/>
There is no special, universal magic in reading a book.  Books are wonderful if you love books.  If you don&#39;t then books are nothing special.  Get over the idea he needs to fully enjoy books.  Let *him* decide what *he&#39;s* going  to fully enjoy.  <br/>
<br/>
 ***I&#39;m just looking to<br/>
support my kid and if learning more about this subject empowers me to do so,<br/>
then I&#39;m going to do that,*** <br/>
<br/>
You said you wanted to know how unschoolers would approach this and you&#39;re making excuses against the unschooling advice you&#39;re getting.  Stop focusing on what you think is the problem and focus on your kid.  Support HIM, not some idea you have about what he should be able to do right now.  If he gets frustrated when he can&#39;t read the things he wants to read, read to him.  Read to him all he wants.  Tell him he&#39;ll positively read someday and tell him lots and lots of people read later and it&#39;s absolutely normal.   Tell him you&#39;ll read to him all he wants until he&#39;s reading for himself.   Don&#39;t make him read.  Don&#39;t ask him to read.  Don&#39;t suggest he try to read. Just read to him. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1745678021">Hi Sara,<br/>
I am brand new to this group.  I just feel completely compelled to <br/>
jump right in and reply to your post though.  It reminds me very much <br/>
of how I felt with my son. <br/>
Four years ago my oldest child was 7 years old.  He was as bright as <br/>
a whip....but for the world he could not read.  Wellll...you know, he <br/>
could read very basic books (notice the contradiction =))...but he <br/>
couldn&#39;t read like most would expect him to.   He reversed letters, <br/>
numbers and words.  He said letters moved around on the page.  He <br/>
couldn&#39;t follow a line of print.  He squinted when he looked at <br/>
print.  He avoided looking at print, and I realized he had for most <br/>
of his life.  He hated going to the library.  His younger brother (5 <br/>
at that time) could read better than him, and had pretty much learned <br/>
to read independently.  I felt a sense of panic seep into my life as <br/>
I researched reading remediation, dyslexia, and the numerous programs <br/>
that existed, sure to *work* for my child. I had just started <br/>
homeschooling and felt full of uncertainty. Reports saying *if your <br/>
child didn&#39;t learn to read by such and such age they would be at an <br/>
educational disadvantage their entire life* filled me with anxiety. <br/>
<br/>
I did have him evaluated by an educational something or another, and <br/>
a vision therapist.  I tried a few reading programs for him, but they <br/>
only resulted in frustration and anger.  He said he didn&#39;t want to <br/>
ever learn how to read.  Boy..I tell you, that was what scared me the <br/>
most I think.   After several months of this, I finally just .... let <br/>
go.   <br/>
<br/>
I stopped trying to teach him to read.  It was hard to do.  I <br/>
worried.  I worried and worried that I was doing the wrong thing.  <br/>
People questioned me too.  I continued to surround him with options <br/>
and opportunities, especially lots and lots of audio books, but I <br/>
left him alone.   I do not know exactly how it happened, because it <br/>
happened to him privately, but he now is an excellent reader who <br/>
eagerly asks when is our next library trip.  He actually takes <br/>
whatever book he is currently reading with us to the library so he <br/>
can continue to read that particular book while his brother and I are <br/>
still browsing.  His bed is covered with books.  He reads slowly (so <br/>
does my husband).  He still reverses letters quite regularly when he <br/>
writes.  But, for the life of me, I am convinced that if I continued <br/>
to push programs on him he would be a very frustrated young person to <br/>
this day.  <br/>
<br/>
Like other people have mentioned...7 is so young.  Of course, when my <br/>
son was 7, I didn&#39;t think that.  I thought, &quot;Why isn&#39;t my son reading <br/>
like expected?&quot;  <br/>
Look into the child&#39;s heart and do what seems right for them, the <br/>
individual.  Forget about expectations.<br/>
<br/>
I remember Ron Davis&#39; book, The Gift of Dyslexia, was very helpful to <br/>
me and to my son.  Honestly, I read parts of that book and thought <br/>
they were completely off the wall.  But, when I read them out loud to <br/>
my son, he related to them.  He definitely has a way of looking at <br/>
things that is different from my way....but that doesn&#39;t mean that he <br/>
is broken or that he needs to be fixed.<br/>
<br/>
My heart goes out to you.  I think I can relate to the worries and <br/>
frustrations.  I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors and <br/>
encourage you to relax as much as possible.  Enjoy your time with <br/>
your family.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1040593453">***I concluded<br/>
that any issue a person has is less important than that person&#39;s<br/>
dignity. I stopped doing it for children, because it was too hard<br/>
for me to see children being drug in by their parents. I saw how the<br/>
therapy was causing a divide between the parent and the child and I<br/>
just could be part of that.***<br/>
<br/>
I am struggling with this same sort of thing with tutoring!  I&#39;ve been<br/>
tutoring kids in reading for the past 5 years. I&#39;ve always thought of myself<br/>
of a pretty laid-back tutor, really focusing on individual needs, not a<br/>
&quot;program&quot; for reading.   But since I&#39;ve been exposed to unschooling, I am<br/>
really having a hard time dealing with the fact that I&#39;m part of a process<br/>
that I don&#39;t really believe in anymore.  I feel bad that parents are paying<br/>
me to improve their child&#39;s reading ability, when the child really doesn&#39;t<br/>
want to be there and is hating reading the more he is forced to come to me!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>True if you want them to read by 9 (the current big slogan in schools  <br/>
in California). Schooled kids need to &quot;hurry up&quot; and read because the  <br/>
rest of their education depends on them being able to read. Not true  <br/>
for unschooled kids.<br/>
<br/>
The risk associated with the treatment seems huge and completely  <br/>
ignored by educator/specialists. I&#39;ve seen it over and over. A 7 year  <br/>
old schooled child is diagnosed as dyslexic and gets treatment for it.  <br/>
By 9, yes, they are reading better. But they NEVER &quot;get over&quot; the  <br/>
feeling that something is wrong with them and they never come to think  <br/>
of themselves as competent readers. They continue to struggle for the  <br/>
rest of their lives.  Unschooled kid at 7 is not reading - parents  <br/>
read to him, get him books from audible.com, listen to cds, surround  <br/>
him with plenty of print and screen text, play with words and writing  <br/>
when it is fun for him. Help him happily when he wants it. Sympathize  <br/>
when he&#39;s frustrated. Reassure him that he WILL read when his brain is  <br/>
ready. Protect him from those who would shame him for not yet  <br/>
reading.  And, eventually, he&#39;ll read. He&#39;ll have a strong sense of  <br/>
his own ability to learn, he won&#39;t think of having something wrong  <br/>
with him.<br/>

True if you want them to read by 9 (the current big slogan in schools<br/>
in California). Schooled kids need to &quot;hurry up&quot; and read because the<br/>
rest of their education depends on them being able to read.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The elementary school in our neighborhood (the one Duncan would have <br/>
gone to) is a &quot;Reading First&quot; school. I mean, that&#39;s how they <br/>
*advertise* it!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;From the Principal<br/>
Dear Families, I am excited about having your children with us. The <br/>
staff looks forward to working with them and I invite you to be very <br/>
visible in the school. We need and want your support daily. Mill Creek <br/>
is a Reading First School and our goal is to have all K-3 students <br/>
reading on grade level by the time they reach 3rd grade. I am available <br/>
to assist you and address your concerns. Thank you for entrusting us <br/>
with your most important possession.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so glad we chose to keep him home!<br/>

Children are now &quot;possessions&quot;? Ack. Can you imagine if someone<br/>
referred to your spouse or partner this way? Or a co-worker? That<br/>

Otoh, at least it&#39;s honest. If they&#39;re going to treat children as<br/>
possessions they might as well call them just that. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2017292973">I taught in &quot;Reading First&quot; schools in Georgia and reading is practically all we taught ALL DAY!  We were required to teach reading for three hours every day (in K-3).  Not just enjoy reading-NO-TEACH it explicitly in every subject.  So we didn&#39;t do science lessons, we had to teach reading lessons with the science text!  When I moved up to 6th and 7th grades to escape it, they started doing similar things in those grades too.  So many kids HATED to read and SO many parents thought that the schools were doing the best thing for their children :(<br/>

  I think this *alot* and my girls are only 3.  I remember reading David Albert&#39;s essays, and he would tell some ludicrous story about a child and school, then always ended the essay with &quot;sure glad we&#39;re homeschooling&quot;!<br/>

  Yep.<br/>

So is dyslexia (like ADHD) really only a problem in school, where <br/>
children<br/>
are forced to learn to read in a certain way, that doesn&#39;t comply with <br/>
the<br/>
way their brain works?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it has so much to do with the &quot;certain way&quot; of learning <br/>
to read as it does with the *timing*. Forcing it too *soon* seems to be <br/>
the problem to me. Well, THAT and...ummmm...forcing at ALL! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
The little bit of reading on dyslexia that I have done suggests that the<br/>
sooner a child with dyslexia gets help, the better.  Do you think that <br/>
would<br/>
not be true with an unschooler, because of the nature of learning?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re reading about children in SCHOOL who are struggling to read. I <br/>
don&#39;t think it has so much to do with the &quot;nature of learning&quot; <br/>
(although it *does*) as it it does with the excessive *need* in school <br/>
to keep to a time table.<br/>
<br/>
*We*, as unschooling parents have all the time in the world to read to <br/>
and for our children. School teachers with 30 kids at a time canNOT <br/>
give such individualized attention to each and every child. Plus, if <br/>
they don&#39;t get those kids to read *soon*, the teachers&#39; own &quot;report <br/>
cards&quot; may be bad, and they could lose their jobs. Ummm.....no such <br/>
luck. Seems you can&#39;t FIRE a teacher! &lt;g&gt; And even if you *could*, the <br/>
shortage would mean that teacher would be hired by the another school <br/>
one district over! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But seriously &lt;g&gt;, there is NO hurry with unschooling. So there&#39;s no <br/>
time table to worry about. So it becomes a non-issue. Even a *true* <br/>
dyslexic will figure out reading with a little more time.<br/>
<br/>
And I don&#39;t know of one, single grown unschooler who cannot read---and <br/>
read very, very well. But I know of many schooled adults who cannot <br/>
read. And many, MANY more who hate it!<br/>
