<div id="ygrps-yiv-1566460321">I KNOW and respect that this is about my daughter and not me, but I&#39;m<br/>
feeling really sad about this, so any guidance is appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter has been saying she wants to try school out.  I am<br/>
committed to this being their journey and supporting what they want to do,<br/>
but I wish she didn&#39;t want to go!  Two or three years ago she mentioned it<br/>
and I found a place that would let her visit for a day.  It was amazing how<br/>
many schools I had to call before I found one that would let her visit.  I<br/>
got a lot of &quot;you can come on open house night&quot; and I said she wanted to see<br/>
the class in action.  One principal told me I could visit but not her, as<br/>
she might &quot;see art on the walls and want that classroom and be disappointed<br/>
if she didn&#39;t get it.&quot;  I said &quot;She&#39;s the one in charge of her education,<br/>
why would I be the only one visiting?&quot;  Anyway, finally a school worked out<br/>
and she went for the day.  It was a private school with four recesses,<br/>
catered lunch, ice cream snack after school - I fretted all day knowing she<br/>
would be nuts over it.  She came home and said she didn&#39;t want to go back -<br/>
because she didn&#39;t want to get up early.<br/>
<br/>
This time it seems different though.  She started making noise about it when<br/>
we moved in July, and I know a big part of it is her having left all of her<br/>
friends.  We also had a very traumatic pet loss that is still bringing us<br/>
grief, which I&#39;m sure is a factor.  I&#39;m working hard on connecting down here<br/>
and making new friends, but you know it sometimes takes time to find the<br/>
right fit, especially when they are thinking of the friends left behind.<br/>
But also, she wants &quot;lessons.&quot;  She wants me to assign her lessons with<br/>
homework - we have never done any lessons as we&#39;ve always unschooled, and I<br/>
think she wants to see what it&#39;s like.  So of course I will accommodate<br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
I think she just wants to see what it&#39;s like, but I also worry that she will<br/>
want to continue.  My husband is ambivalent about homeschooling; he<br/>
recognizes its advantages but also thinks school has advantages.  It&#39;s<br/>
ironic because he didn&#39;t finish college, was an entrepreneur, thinks outside<br/>
the box, and is very successful.  I&#39;m sure my daughter has picked up his<br/>
vibes and it undermines my homeschooling/unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
But also, I can tell that she would fit in really well at school - she makes<br/>
friends very easily, is a leader, I can totally see her thriving.  It feels<br/>
selfish of me but I&#39;m anticipating/hoping that her natural tendency to<br/>
master something quickly and then get bored easily, will manifest in school.<br/>
She also doesn&#39;t like to be told what to do (and rightly so), so I do think<br/>
that aspect of school will get old soon.  I tell myself that if it does come<br/>
down to it, there are two-three charters around here that enable kids to go<br/>
to school 2 days a week while homeschooling the rest.<br/>
<br/>
Have any of you had kids who were curious and/or really wanted to go to<br/>
school?  How did you handle your personal feelings about institutionalized<br/>
learning while respecting their need to experience these things themselves?<br/>
I am trying to not take it personally (feel rejected and/or that I &quot;failed&quot;<br/>
in unschooling her) and see it as simply her curiosity and her path to walk,<br/>
but it&#39;s difficult.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Shannon<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-95154043">Hi Shannon-<br/>
<br/>
My son(now 14) started talking quite a bit about going to school a <br/>
couple of years ago- I remember feeling really sad and angry, and it <br/>
took some time to get to a place where I could let it be only about him, <br/>
not me.<br/>
<br/>
He has since participated in a high school musical and jazz band, and <br/>
while he enjoys those things, it is enough for now. He comments about <br/>
how the kids interact and how the band leader treats the kids, and I <br/>
don&#39;t think he would feel comfortable in that situation all day, though <br/>
a few hours is okay. I suggested he visit the school during the day, but <br/>
he was not interested.<br/>
<br/>
I have made a huge effort to help him get involved in the home schooling <br/>
community- luckily there are many kids his age who share interests and <br/>
he does have that peer group he was curious about experiencing, with the <br/>
plus that the kids are generally easier to get along with. <br/>
<br/>
Helping him make connections in the community with adults and older <br/>
teens that share interests has also really helped him remain interested <br/>
in life out of school. He most recently has said that he would be too <br/>
busy to go to school. Being plugged into things going outside of the <br/>
home has been increasingly important for him (music groups, friends, <br/>
apprenticeships, jobs, classes, magic tournaments, etc)- and school <br/>
doesn&#39;t at the moment seem like a very appealing option for that. We are <br/>
lucky to live in an area that has many options and many kind and <br/>
welcoming people who have invited him to participate in their work and <br/>
projects- it can take persistence- though at this point it really just <br/>
unfolds naturally.<br/>
<br/>
It is so ironic- most people are talking about how to keep kids in <br/>
school( I just read an article in the local paper about dropout <br/>
factories), and here we are talking about how to keep them out!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-217660933">Shannon,<br/>
 My oldest Daughter has been going to school for two months now, and <br/>
she loves the interaction with the kids and the teachers who are <br/>
respectful and treat her as I would expect someone who is employed and <br/>
paid by us and our tax dollars to teach our children. (that is, with <br/>
respect and understanding) She&#39;s been really lucky and all but one of <br/>
her teachers are confident enough in themselves to treat the kids with <br/>
respect. The hardest part for me is dealing with &quot;problems&quot; like just <br/>
last week when she was told by the principal that she couldn&#39;t come <br/>
back until she changed her hair color to something &quot;normal&quot; (she had <br/>
blue tips on her blonde hair as part of her halloween costume, but she <br/>
liked enough that we did it with the semi permanent dye) So her and I <br/>
discussed it and I told her I would talk to the principal for her if <br/>
she wanted because no where in the dress code did it say that kids <br/>
can&#39;t have blue or any other color hair, or she could just stay home, <br/>
or we could change it. In the end she decided she&#39;d rather just change <br/>
it and so we made the tips white with white highlights and it looks <br/>
nice. The hardest part for me is feeling so protective, I&#39;m ready to <br/>
jump any of the school establishment as soon as I feel they are <br/>
infringing on her rights. The hardest part for her is getting up in the <br/>
morning and I think that might be the reason she decides to stop and <br/>
come back home. If she deosn&#39;t want to get up, I remind her that she&#39;ll <br/>
have make up work (becasue I know my brain doesn&#39;t always think of <br/>
consequences when I&#39;m just trying to eek out another 10 minutes of <br/>
sleep ;)) and some days she does stay home, on average one day every <br/>
other week she decides to stay home. SO far this hasn&#39;t been a problem <br/>
with the school, but I&#39;m not sure how many days she can miss before <br/>
they start calling me and sending letters etc. Even then, she probably <br/>
wont care about it, it will be myself and my own anxiety. I don&#39;t know <br/>
if this helps at all, but I just thought I&#39;d let you know my experience <br/>
so far.<br/>
Namaste,<br/>
Gen<br/>

karate or whatever. That may be enough of what she needs, right <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, trying school or a class doesn&#39;t mean she needs to stay <br/>
there for the whole run of the class/semester/year. That&#39;s something <br/>
*you* (and dh) need to be okay with, especially if you are looking <br/>
at a private school. If your dd decides, eight weeks in, that she&#39;s <br/>
had enough, but you&#39;ve signed a contract.... are there issues that <br/>
will bring up for you? For your dh? That&#39;s something to discuss with <br/>
her, if so. Would she be willing to try the public, knowing she can <br/>
leave any time, and maybe go for the private school next year? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1754152462">&lt;&lt;&lt;Have any of you had kids who were curious and/or really wanted to go to<br/>
school? How did you handle your personal feelings about institutionalized<br/>
learning while respecting their need to experience these things themselves?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My 12yo son Sam did go.  He&#39;s much like you describe your daughter, confident <br/>
and usually makes friends easily.  He had a lot of the same reasons, wanting <br/>
to see what it was like.  I could relate because I tend to be curious and a <br/>
bit of a risk-taker, I think under the same circumstances it would&#39;ve bothered <br/>
me not to  *know* what I was missing.  Yet of course, I also had feelings that <br/>
I had failed and that he was rejecting the path I&#39;d chosen because I thought <br/>
it was so much better for him.<br/>
 <br/>
So he went to the local public school for 5th grade.  And it was awful for me <br/>
at first, not because the school was so bad, but because it was relatively <br/>
&quot;good,&quot; and much of what I&#39;d told him didn&#39;t turn out to be true, and it was a <br/>
real shot to my credibility!  LOL    He *didn&#39;t* get a lot of homework, kids <br/>
were nice and there wasn&#39;t any bullying, and the teacher was fairly progressive <br/>
in that she didn&#39;t assign busywork but used more of a unit study approach <br/>
where they did projects to cover more than one subject.  So he liked it...made <br/>
lots of friends, played soccer at recess, got elected class president, and talked <br/>
about how great it was and I really tried my best to be happy for him.  My <br/>
daughter was still at home though, and completely happy with that choice, so <br/>
that helped.  And I kept reminding myself that a lot of the damage that occurs in <br/>
school is because kids are there against their will.<br/>
 <br/>
So months went by, and by the time testing came around in the spring, the fun <br/>
started to drain away and the teacher&#39;s perky smile began to fade, and he&#39;d <br/>
come home complaining more often.  Once she threw away a piece of origami he <br/>
was working on (when he was supposed to be doing something &quot;productive,&quot; she <br/>
said) and he came home in tears.  I responded by &quot;helpfully&quot; emailing her a pile <br/>
of articles on the educational value of origami, and he felt better.<br/>
 <br/>
Then in June he started thinking he didn&#39;t want to go to 6th grade.  He <br/>
wished he could just skip it and go to 7th, because he really wanted to know what <br/>
junior high was like.  Well, since I had placed him low, he really was just old <br/>
enough to go to 7th, so I started making phone calls.  Apparently it&#39;s not <br/>
something they do, except in &quot;really rare circumstances&quot; but I somehow managed <br/>
to convince them how rare our circumstances really were, reminding them that <br/>
he&#39;d never opened a textbook before 5th grade, so why wouldn&#39;t he be able to <br/>
just walk into 7th the same way?  His grades were good, but certainly not enough <br/>
to warrant acceleration to 7th grade.  Ultimately I think it was because they <br/>
knew I was willing to pull him out and put him in &quot;private school&quot; at home and <br/>
they didn&#39;t want to lose money, so the principal and the teacher signed off <br/>
on it.<br/>
 <br/>
And then in the fall, after less than two weeks of junior high, he quit.  WAY <br/>
too much homework, and the teachers were strict and disrespectful toward the <br/>
kids, and it was much harder to make friends with all that class switching and <br/>
no real recess.  At first I found a part of myself wishing he&#39;d stay, to <br/>
*prove* he could do it since I&#39;d made the effort to get him there, then I realized <br/>
that was nuts and I was completely losing sight of the original goal.  (And <br/>
fortunately, dh agreed.)<br/>
 <br/>
So now he&#39;s home and happy, and *knows* for himself that unschooling is <br/>
definitely better.  (And my credibility has been restored. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-594410309">Hi Shannon!  I haven&#39;t read all of the posts, due to lack of time <br/>
today, so forgive me if I repeat advice you have already been given.<br/>
<br/>
My kids ages 15, 12, and almost 9 have basically been unschooled <br/>
their entire lives, with the exception of my oldest who we tried <br/>
curriculums with when he was very young but quickly through them <br/>
out.  <br/>
<br/>
Kev, my oldest, decided he wanted to give school a try this year <br/>
too.  I was so sad at his decision but didn&#39;t say a whole lot, <br/>
besides any concerns I had for him.  I supported him in his decision <br/>
because that is part of what unschooling is <br/>
about................TRUST.  We trust them to know what they need, <br/>
when they need it.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, he is 2 1/2 months into school; it has been a mostly positive <br/>
experience for him but he thinks it is a BIG waste of time!!  He has <br/>
no time for the things that are meaningful to him, the things that he <br/>
is really passionate about, and there is really no social life at <br/>
school like he thought there would be and for that reason he has <br/>
decided to not go to school next year.  For whatever reason though he <br/>
is determined to stick it out the entire year.  When I ask him why he <br/>
says so that he can say he did it. It&#39;s hard to watch him barely able <br/>
to wake up and grumble about how stupid it is as he joins the masses <br/>
but it is what he is CHOOSING to do so........  I would rather have <br/>
him say that he did it and he hated it than to blame me for a lost <br/>
experience that he felt he needed to have. <br/>
<br/>
Some of his reasons initially for wanting to go to school were <br/>
because of the Japanese program they have at his school, he thought <br/>
it would enrich his social life, and a lot of his friends were <br/>
going.  He was also just curious about what this thing called school, <br/>
er jail, was all about. <br/>
<br/>
I think they are capable of figuring it out and they know with <br/>
unschooling parents they have a soft place to land and lots of <br/>
support AND the choice to come home when and if they want to.  I <br/>
would let your daughter have that experience no matter how painful it <br/>
is to you.</div>

somehow, but I also know that no matter how well I provide a great home<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-601325689">This thread has brought up a question for me. What do some of you say <br/>
to your kids (when they are little) about school? What do you think <br/>
is appropriate?<br/>
<br/>
When my ds1 was really little and he found out about day cares, I <br/>
simply stated that he didn&#39;t have to go since either daddy or I was <br/>
always home with him. I&#39;ve kind of framed school in the same way. He <br/>
doesn&#39;t have to go because I&#39;m home. I&#39;ve gone on to emphasize all <br/>
the fun and interesting things we get to do during the day together. <br/>
I feel that part of my emphasizing the good is my fear that he will <br/>
ask to go. He does go two afternoons a week to a Waldorf style <br/>
afternoon group run by a former Waldorf kindergarten teacher. He <br/>
really enjoys it but some days (like today) he says he doesn&#39;t want <br/>
to go so he stays home.<br/>
