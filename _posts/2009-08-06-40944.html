<div id="ygrps-yiv-1278570244">Whoa!  I was reading the comments and thinking that y&#39;all can come to<br/>
our homeschooling group any day!  One of our families have little ones<br/>
who speek in (let&#39;s call them the Smiths) Smith-ese.  This is more than<br/>
simply switching words around, it sounds very much like someone with a<br/>
REALLY thick accent who is on their third language.  When the children<br/>
reach 6-8 they begin talking in what I would call regular-ese.  The<br/>
family has many children; they have all gone through the Smith-ese<br/>
stage, and the ones who are over 8 speak normally.  We have learned to<br/>
adapt to the &quot;dialect&quot; and if I can&#39;t understand one of the kids, I ask<br/>
an older sibling to translate.  It works out, no one is shamed, and no<br/>
one is corrected.  <br/>
 <br/>
I love to watch these folks be totally supportive of all their kids, and<br/>
they have shown me how to be more supportive of my own! <br/>
 <br/>
blessings and peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1386598494">LOL DH and I have a &#39;private language&#39; between us. Closest thing I can<br/>
compare to is Andy Kaufman&#39;s character on Taxi. It&#39;s basically nonsense<br/>
syllables that use tonal and context cues to communicate. We can have a<br/>
complete conversation about something without anyone being the wiser -<br/>
works way better when trying to decide whether to go out for ice cream<br/>
than trying to spell around DS LOL (my folks tried using pig latin to<br/>
talk &#39;around&#39; us kids, but we got better at it than mom so we&#39;d know<br/>
what dad said before she did! Then they switched to another &#39;fake&#39;<br/>
language like that and we learned that one too - I am proud to say I am<br/>
fluent in three gibberish type languages! Any ubbi-dubbi speakers out<br/>
there?)<br/>
