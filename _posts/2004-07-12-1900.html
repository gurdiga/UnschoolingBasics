I do  have to comment here.  I have signed off other<br/>
email unschooling lists  because of the kind of jumping<br/>
on wording and a harsh judgemental  atmosphere.  I like<br/>
to have a respectful and non judging atmosphere  and a<br/>
forum to not be afraid to put out ideas and ask<br/>
questions without  fear of being judged.  We are all<br/>
trying to do our best with our  children and i think<br/>
when we share our experiences it is very helpful,  but<br/>
i will have to sign off this list also if it becomes a<br/>
jump on  people and judge thing instead of a &quot;this is<br/>
what works for me in my  family&quot; . &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
No one is being forced to stay here. Sign on or off as you see fit. <br/>

Describing how someone posts is clearly against list guidelines. Please  <br/>
refrain from doing so.<br/>

You could start your own e-list, and if there is a need for the forum based on the principles you are describing, it would surely grow.<br/>

Good Luck,<br/>
