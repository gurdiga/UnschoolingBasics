Oh my....you&#39;re 6months pregnant and feeling guilty for wanting a break!? Get all those &quot;shoulds&quot; your mother put into your head OUT of there!:)<br/>
If your child is happy, if  you&#39;re enjoying yourself, there is no problem. I think it&#39;s really good for us to know our limits, to care for ourselves with &quot;down&quot; days.  What kind of example is it to our children if we never know our limits or say &quot;I&#39;m too tired to do anything right now&quot;?<br/>
If you were exhausted and your child needed something more, it&#39;s time for your dh to take over! Or someone else.....<br/>
We certainly avoid the outdoors right now, unless we&#39;re swimming or at the beach. I think you and your family should do what works for YOU all, and forget about what your mother thinks.<br/>
Sounds like a happy, pleasant day to me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-132160072">HI Ren,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Yes I am 6 months pregnant and feeling guilty over a break:-)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I am working on vacating my mom, she is stubborn though and I am resisting<br/>
for some reason.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
You are right, I sure do say &quot;I am tired and need a rest&quot; more now than<br/>
ever. I know that if I don&#39;t get enough rest I am a miserable mom, so to get<br/>
the rest makes sense. It makes it hard when she resists my taking care of<br/>
myself. Guess she is pushing some more buttons for me:-)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have let go of the guilt of Saturday and we just enjoyed ourselves and our<br/>
life that day was equal to our abilities, which made for much happier people<br/>
in the long run.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
