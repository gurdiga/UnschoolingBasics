<div id="ygrps-yiv-530641509">The biggest thing that jumped out at me was the comment about &quot;making less than $50,000 a year&quot; if you don&#39;t go to college.  How about all the out of work college grads who not only don&#39;t have a job, but also have a TON of student loans when they start out their lives after college?  Many college degree areas (English, liberal arts, etc, etc) don&#39;t = high paying career!<br/>
I went to a private 4 yr college for a BS in Biology and then got a master&#39;s in Education, and still as a teacher was only making $35,000 a year!  My dh is a geologist (4 yr college degree) and now after 15 yrs of experience is just making over $50,000 a year.  We have never both worked at the same time (so that one of us was home with the kids).  And yet, we own a home, land, pets, are able to take trips, homeschool, feed and clothe the family just fine.<br/>
Sorry I don&#39;t have time to pick apart the rest of it.<br/>
