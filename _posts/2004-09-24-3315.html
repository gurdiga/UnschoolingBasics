I read  an article by some Dr. who suggested nose picking and booger<br/>
eating were  good activities to engage in.  I&#39;ll see if I can find it.   I<br/>
think Dana Hoffman sent it to me and if she&#39;s on this list maybe  she<br/>
still has it and will send it first.   <br/>

When Julian was still in school he had a serious nose-picking habit, and it  <br/>
drove me crazy. Well, at one point when he was in his last year there, third  <br/>
grade, I went to his class because they had a friend who was a storyteller  <br/>
coming.<br/>
 <br/>
The kids all sat on the floor around Tony...and EVERY kid quietly  picked <br/>
their nose happily the entire time. I swear, it was a sight to behold,  <br/>
twenty-something eight year olds, and every one a nose-picker. I decided at that  point <br/>
it was best to lighten up.<br/>
