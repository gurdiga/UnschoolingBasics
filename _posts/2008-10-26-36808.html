<div id="ygrps-yiv-1570081729">Kal has been invited to play on a private server run by Wowfusion. I told him before he does anything I need to look into it. The rules in WoW state that you cannot run third party software. Then I went to WoWfusion to read about their servers and they say the same thing and their rules are stricter than blizzards. Has anyone played on a private server? Is it safe or is it against the rules? Thanks for any info. <br/>

If you are playing on a private server, then you are not connecting to<br/>
Blizzard so you don&#39;t need to worry about your regular WoW account and the<br/>
ToS there. The private server may have their own ToS which you must adhere<br/>
to. To connect to a private server, you simply modify a text file in your<br/>
World Of Warcraft install directory to point to a different login and realm<br/>
server. Most people would say that it IS a violation of the ToS for the<br/>
&quot;client&quot; software to connect to a non-Blizzard server.<br/>
<br/>
One *very important * thing to keep in mind is that many private servers are<br/>
not compatible with the latest patch versions of WoW from Blizzard. I highly<br/>
recommend making a copy of your WoW directory to a different place on your<br/>
disk and using one for private servers and one for Blizzard servers. That<br/>
way, they never update each other and you can keep your compatibility with<br/>
both. This is especially true if you use a lot of the popular &#39;mods&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Also, setting up your own private server is not difficult if you are a<br/>
little computer savvy. There are at least 2 major distributions for the<br/>
server/database and you just use install the maps which are already in your<br/>
WoW directory. Of course you need to find people to play with you on your<br/>
private server or it&#39;s not very fun. It can fun to design your own gear or<br/>
give yourself unlimited powers though..<br/>
