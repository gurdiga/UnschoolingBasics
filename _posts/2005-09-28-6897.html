<div id="ygrps-yiv-1387836715">We have been deschooling our dtr (11 yo)since Spring and I was missing <br/>
out until I decided to be a part of her world.  She was always on <br/>
neopets, toontown or on her PS2.  I&#39;m very much a novice at the games <br/>
but who cares, she actually thinks its funny to watch me play her <br/>
games.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, the time on the games has dramatically dropped over the past <br/>
couple of weeks.  We have been doing more crafts, watching movies and <br/>
talking more.  <br/>
<br/>
For me I just keep reading everything I can get my hands on about <br/>
unschooling and read the posts on this site.  I know it works and my <br/>
dtr will be far better in the long run.  <br/>
<br/>
Play on!<br/>

Toontown!  Cool.  We play.  Let me know if she wants a secret friend or two.  I could put her on my friends list or my daughter&#39;s (age 11).<br/>
