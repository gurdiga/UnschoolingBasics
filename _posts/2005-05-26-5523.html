<div id="ygrps-yiv-1657086421">Well this will come as NO suprise to most of you :)<br/>
<br/>
I signed on a couple of months ago.  I have a young<br/>
son who has type 1 diabetes, he is 9 and I have been<br/>
homeschooling 11 years.<br/>
<br/>
I am burt out on homeschooling.  Wanted to explore the<br/>
unschooling world.<br/>
<br/>
Someone (don&#39;t remember who!) from this list told me<br/>
&quot;Just enjoy your son.  If by the end of May he&#39;s<br/>
learned nothing let me know, it will be a first&quot; or<br/>
something to that extent.<br/>
<br/>
Well, You were Right!!  In the past couple of months,<br/>
the first month, nada.  He played video games, watched<br/>
tv, played computer games.  Then I realized.  He is<br/>
drawing maps for his games.  He is inventing &quot;moves&quot;<br/>
using his light sabre (and various household items<br/>
including taking apart my broom!) he&#39;d spend literally<br/>
hours practicing!  So cute!  He even named them!<br/>
<br/>
Then a couple of weeks ago, he asked to learn how to<br/>
make scrambled eggs.  He is now a &quot;chef of all<br/>
scrambling&quot; in our house.  <br/>
<br/>
He has written a couple of stories based on his tv<br/>
show and his xbox game.  He has also developed new<br/>
characters for tv/computer games complete with<br/>
pictures and details of various &quot;powers&quot;.  He drew<br/>
more maps, etc.  Researched for &#39;cheat&#39; codes (dont<br/>
know quite how I feel about that one...but OK....)<br/>
<br/>
Today he came out and asked how light bulbs were<br/>
invented.  He has spent most of the day drawing<br/>
lightbulbs and researching Lightbulbs.<br/>
<br/>
This is amazing!<br/>

cheating as &quot;cheating on your taxes&quot; exactly. Yes, it can make you <br/>
invincible or whatever but they were deliberately put into the game to <br/>
be used. The thrill of finding them and using them (some are pretty <br/>
complex to use, can only be used a certain way at certain times and <br/>
all like that) is part and parcel of things. Both my DH and DS use <br/>
cheat codes for video games - DH will find things like invincibility <br/>
and show DS how to get it so that DS (he&#39;s just about to be 7) can get <br/>
through the game with less frustration until he is ready to go at it <br/>
without the cheat codes. It&#39;s part treasure hunt, part easter egg hunt <br/>
(and little hidden bits in some software packages are actually called <br/>
easter eggs).</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1695210468">Thanks Debra!  LOL I know nothing about computer and<br/>
video games....that&#39;s my dh&#39;s and son&#39;s department! <br/>
LOL<br/>
<br/>
I feel better now!  I hadn&#39;t said anything because I<br/>
thought, well, he is researching....:) I didn&#39;t want<br/>
to squash that desire in him to seek and find!  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks a bunch :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1657350614">When my son was home, video games taught him:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
1.  To use the internet for research as he searched for cheat codes so that<br/>
he could advance to the next level (higher levels) of his game.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
2.  Copy and paste text as he needed to take the text from the web page to<br/>
word for printing.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
3.  How to use the printer so he could print out his codes.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
And then there were some cross learning that took place.  Like, and I used<br/>
to joke about this, he had a large vocabulary when it came to weaponry and<br/>
becoming extinguished. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s good for them to spend LONG periods of time learning and<br/>
conquering a game.  Maybe later in life they will tackle a project at a job<br/>
in that same manner?  Maybe they learn that even a new unfamiliar game can<br/>
me beaten if you just pour time and attention into it?  That might be a good<br/>
&quot;carry over&quot; lesson.<br/>

mines used in 007 games - proximity mines and all the rest and how <br/>
they work and such. It also gave rise to an interesting discussion of <br/>
mines IRL and what happens after the battles are over and the mines <br/>
remain. And he knows the various other weapons (he can ID the type of <br/>
gun from the silhouette) that get used as well.</div>

<br/>
Learning how to focus in order to accomplish a difficult goal is <br/>
wonderful. Learning that you get to success by achieving repeated small <br/>
victories is fantastic!! Sticking to something in spite of failures - <br/>
trying again, with small variations, until something works.<br/>
<br/>
Awesome learning!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-149186641">Hi Krisula, I battle with this one.  I have been letting go alot <br/>
more lately -m but still feeling uncomfortable about it. Today I was <br/>
sick in bed all day, so my husband stayed home (he is my 11yr old <br/>
unschooled sons stepfather).<br/>
<br/>
He told em at the end of the day after having dropped Dan off at <br/>
Drama class that he was really pissed off with Daniel as he had <br/>
spent all day playing Runescape and had told him he was not to play <br/>
any more computer games between 9am and 3pm.<br/>
<br/>
My physical energy was pretty low at the time, and I didn;t really <br/>
have the energy for an unschooling philosphy discussion... - all I <br/>
said at the time was &quot;That was not your decision to make, I wish you <br/>
had consulted me before issuing a rule like that&quot;.  I also said that <br/>
I was really uncomfortable about it too (the truth) and I was tryign <br/>
to find my way to feeling OK about it.  We ended the conv by him <br/>
saying something like &quot;well, you should at least enforce that for a <br/>
week&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Right when I was just starting to relax a little more, I have <br/>
totally picked up on all his &#39;stuff&#39; and feel those yukky old <br/>
anxieties building. I lay in bed thinking about some of your posts, <br/>
and wondering to myself &#39;is this path really the right one&quot;, &quot;am I <br/>
really doing the right thing for Daniel&quot;. He still seems so <br/>
unmotivated, a little lost - he came out of school last July <br/>
(remembering that our summer break in NZ is December/January).<br/>
<br/>
My trust in this process feels so be such a delicate creature.  It <br/>
feels strong sometimes, and like a gibbering idiot at others, unable <br/>
to explain itself to anyone.<br/>
<br/>
I am still struggling with my almost 3yr old, and feel like he is <br/>
draining so much of my available energy, and there&#39;s none left for <br/>
Daniel - no wonder he is so unmotivated - I feel that way too! <br/>
(sorry to sound so negative everyone...)<br/>
<br/>
Ahhhhhhhh- life feels tricky sometimes huh.<br/>

<br/>
Does dh realize that he designated school hours as the verboten time?<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if he was having a knee jerk reaction to an unexpressed desire to<br/>
have more of his step son&#39;s attention, spend more time together doing fun<br/>
stuff? Perhaps he is feeling left out, especially as you are ill also and<br/>
presumably unavailable. Not that I agree with his proposed solution to the<br/>
problem!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; to find my way to feeling OK about it.  We ended the conv by him <br/>
saying something like &quot;well, you should at least enforce that for a <br/>
week&quot;. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It is hard to feel ok about a plan that sounds increasingly like a<br/>
punishment. I like that he wants you to the dirty work of enforcement! My dh<br/>
is like that too sometimes: &quot;I have this problem, here&#39;s how *you* fix it&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Seriously, I think trying to get at what your dh actually wants, rather than<br/>
focusing on what he doesn&#39;t want, might help. Even getting him to elucidate<br/>
what the heck he hopes to gain by this limitation idea, might help him to<br/>
realize how counterproductive it is - he might talk himself out of it.(My dh<br/>
does that sometimes too.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; He still seems so <br/>
unmotivated, a little lost - he came out of school last July <br/>
(remembering that our summer break in NZ is December/January).&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Definitely your son is still deschooling, and by others&#39; accounts this<br/>
appearance of &quot;unmotivated&quot; is typical (almost universal!), as is the focus<br/>
on computer games.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you feel well soon.<br/>
