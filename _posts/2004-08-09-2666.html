My son who is 16 has been smoking for about a year. He did get a warning<br/>
from a police officer, who then called me, about him bein under age and<br/>
smoking in public. Here in VT you can buy cigerettes when you are 18.<br/>
Out of my six kids, three daughters and three sons, 3 smoke (two<br/>
daughters and one son)and three don&#39;t. My husband and I smoked when we<br/>
were younger. We quit to be healthier and so our kids would be<br/>
healthier. One of my son&#39;s has allergies and my daughter had a premature<br/>
baby 4 months ago. We put restrictions around smoking around my son with<br/>
allergies and our grandson. My mother died of cancer in 2000. She was a<br/>
smoker, an alcoholic, and refinished furniture for many years. She had a<br/>
hard life and although she worked at understanding her circumstances,<br/>
continued to have a hard life. She and my father divorced because he<br/>
wanted to be with another woman. He was also a child molester. She then<br/>
married an alcoholic. I think what I am working at saying is that I<br/>
believe smoking has more to do with emotional problems than just<br/>
experimenting if it lasts for any length of time. I hope I don&#39;t get<br/>
beat on for saying that... My children that smoke seem to have more<br/>
emotional difficulties than the ones who don&#39;t. That is my observation.<br/>

I tend to agree with you.  My middle son has been smoking since he was  17.  <br/>
I know that he knows how bad they are for you because he went to  school until <br/>
6th grade and they hammer it into kids in school.<br/>
 <br/>
But, he&#39;s a somewhat nervous type, always chewing his fingernails.  If  any <br/>
of my kids were going to smoke, it would be him.  I always thought his  intense <br/>
desire not to smell bad or be dirty would prevent him from  smoking.  I guess <br/>
his sense of smell is diminished.  I&#39;m disappointed  that he smokes, and I am <br/>
frustrated that he doesn&#39;t believe his sinus  infections (which he never had <br/>
before he started smoking) are related to  smoking.  But I don&#39;t bring it up.<br/>
