You do bees!!!<br/>
<br/>
I want to learn bees so  much.  Could you recommend some websites, books,  <br/>
etc.?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

I have two hives. I got the hives themselves last Christmas and the bees  for <br/>
the following (early) Mother&#39;s Day.<br/>
 <br/>
If you&#39;re going to have them *this* year, buy NOW! Get your hives asap and  <br/>
paint them and get them ready for your &quot;girls.&quot; You need to hive your girls  in <br/>
March/April, depending on your location---so it&#39;s time now to start making  <br/>
plans!<br/>
 <br/>
There are some awful pests and diseases that are attacking bees right  <br/>
now---mites, hive beetles, and wax moths----just to name a few. Getting your  bees <br/>
can be hard because there&#39;s a severe shortage. I&#39;m trying to avoid  chemicals <br/>
and pesticides, so I use teatree oil and powdered sugar and pipe  tobacco to <br/>
keep them healthy. You don&#39;t HAVE to use chemicals!<br/>
 <br/>
There are TONS of books and websites . I use Brushy Mountain Bee Farm ---  <br/>
_www.beeequipment.com_ (http://www.beeequipment.com)  and their phone number is <br/>
1-800-BEESWAX  &lt;g&gt; for  supplies AND bees.<br/>
 <br/>
But my best advice is to find a local beekeeper  who will help you.  Our <br/>
beekeepers association has a monthly  meeting with timely topics----and several <br/>
oldtimers volunteer to come out  and help you set up or check your bees or be on <br/>
call for all sorts of pathetic  questions! &lt;g&gt; They offer classes every <br/>
spring for new and potential  keepers.<br/>
 <br/>
Ask around---maybe with your local Agricultural department.<br/>
 <br/>
I started with two hives, one smaller English Garden Hive and a larger  <br/>
&quot;regular&quot; hive. I put 2 lbs of bees in the smaller hive and 3 lbs in the  larger <br/>
one, with marked queens. All together, I spent maybe $300? A friend gave  me her <br/>
heavy duty bee suit----but some thick cover-alls and duct tape will  work.  <br/>
My BEEginner&#39;s Kit came with gloves and a veil as well as all the  hives tools.<br/>
 <br/>
They are (to me) absolutely the most fascinating creatures on the planet! I  <br/>
can sit out there all day and watch them fly out to forage---and when I enter  <br/>
the hives, I probably spend WAAAAY too much time just poking around! &lt;G&gt; <br/>
 <br/>
We didn&#39;t rob them last year because I was more concerned with their having  <br/>
enough food through their first winter. But they had loads of honey in there  <br/>
yesterday when I checked---AND are already foraging in this stupid SC weather  <br/>
(79 yesterday----but it&#39;ll be down to 19 this weekend). But it&#39;s standard  <br/>
practice NOT to rob them the first year. You get a little honey the second; the  <br/>
third year on, you can plan on bumper crops! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
My gardens were more vibrant and productive last year than ever before (I  <br/>
have fruit, vegetable, herb, and flower gardens) ----and I know it was  due to <br/>
the girls. I&#39;m the only one to have been stung (three times). The girls  <br/>
haven&#39;t bothered the children/pets at all.<br/>
 <br/>
Your library should have numerous bee books, but if they don&#39;t, I&#39;d ask  <br/>
Brushy Mountain what they&#39;d recommend. The web is chocked full, but I have none  <br/>
bookmarked. But my best advice is another, experienced beekeeper. Jack and <br/>
Frank  and Mike have been invaluable to me!<br/>
 <br/>
OH! and just DOING it! &lt;g&gt; You&#39;ll learn SO much just by being  IN the hive! <br/>
 <br/>
~Kelly, happy beekeeper<br/>

Go ahead and laugh, but those Funshops plant seeds! I&#39;ve wanted to <br/>
beekeep for ages; now, I know some one to turn to when we have the space.<br/>
<br/>
This Christmas we got a belly dancing DVD set (thanks to Mindy!), and <br/>
I&#39;m seriously considering working with service animals (thanks to <br/>
Kelly!) if we move to a larger property--and getting bees, too, of course.<br/>
<br/>
You never know where these things will lead. Isn&#39;t that WONDERFUL!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeh, but I just frightened dh by telling him I got on the subject of  <br/>
Nat&#39;l Guard Logistics Officers from mud wrestling. He wouldn&#39;t ask <br/>
why even when I dared him!<br/>
<br/>
Now this is, of course, directly on subject: how to win over spouses <br/>
and others who don&#39;t immediately leap at the chance to just sit back <br/>
and enjoy whatever subjects happen to come up. I mean, it can&#39;t be <br/>
that easy, can it?<br/>
