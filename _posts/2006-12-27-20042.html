<div id="ygrps-yiv-8228409">I have gotten this question nearly everyday from my dd (6) since I<br/>
told them we were taking a good long vacation from schoolwork. That<br/>
was on the dec. 8th. I just have been answering &quot;no school day for a<br/>
while, sweetie, but everyday is a learning day&quot;. Then sometimes I get<br/>
the &quot;but how is that if we aren&#39;t doing school work?&quot; So we&#39;ve talked<br/>
about learning through everything she does and that if she wants to<br/>
read or play a game or do her crafts, to do it. I have even said if<br/>
she wants to do a few workbook pages she can to, but she doesn&#39;t have<br/>
to and shouldn&#39;t do it to make me happy, but because she wants to... I<br/>
think she&#39;s having a hard time with it the &quot;no schedule, no school<br/>
time&quot;.  She likes the workbooks as it gives her something to work on -<br/>
to prove she knows &quot;important&quot; stuff (I know, that&#39;s the school<br/>
brainwashing - even at this young age). <br/>
<br/>
DS (twin) on the other hand hasn&#39;t asked a single time. I think he<br/>
fears that I will say &quot;yes - school tomorrow&quot; if he asks so he just<br/>
avoids all mention to it - even to the point where he shushes dd when<br/>
she brings it up&quot;... <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking I just need to sit them down and simply tell them we<br/>
aren&#39;t going back to the schoolwork as we used to do it. The past 3<br/>
wks have been real eye openers for dh and I in regards to how much<br/>
they actually are learning if given the space and time they want (and<br/>
assistance when asked). And not just in the schoolish terms but in<br/>
managing their own bodies with food and sleep, etc. <br/>

  My 6 year old daughter went to pre-school and kindy.  We put her in 1st grade this year and pulled her and her sister out at the end of Sept.  It&#39;s amazing what those two years (not even full time) did to my 6 year old.  The whole school thing is so engraved in her head.  She says stuff to me all the time like &quot;Mom, you aren&#39;t teaching us anything&quot; or &quot;Mom, we need to do this, that, or the other thing in order to learn like the neighborhood kids in school&quot;.  My 8 year old let go of that stuff immediately and was so meant for &quot;Unschooling&quot;.  I am having a harder time getting my 6 year old to let it go.  She even wants to call me Miss Kelly, and take attendance in the morning.  The other day she asked me how to do something on the computer, I told her, and she looked at me and said &quot;Mommy, you taught me something&quot;.  I said to her Yes, Mariah, that is how Unschooling works........it does not have to come from a text book or from a teacher lexturing in front of a classroom.  <br/>

  Kelly, my daughter has been the same way.  She and my son went to school for only 5 months last year.  It was their first time in school.  After that she thought she wasn&#39;t learning anything if we weren&#39;t doing any &quot;work&quot;.  I just keep explaining to her that learning happens everyday, all the time....it&#39;s called LIFE - and LIFE is learning.  She&#39;s starting to get it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My DD is only 2 so I am not saying this from unschooling experience<br/>
with her, but I think you should keep some worksheets around. I think<br/>
the true unschooling experience means giving the kids what they want<br/>
when they ask for it. It would not be US to assign them to her, but if<br/>
you have the books around and she wants to do it, fine. It could be a<br/>
phase of her deschooling or it could be that she likes that kind of work. <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t be sure since I was schooled, but I think I would have liked<br/>
doing that kind of busy work anyway. I remember doing some of those<br/>
workbooks at home that were left over from my older brothers and I<br/>
thought it was fun. No one asked me to do it or graded it. I realized<br/>
it this weekend when I was dong a circle the letter puzzle in the<br/>
paper for the first time in many, many years. It&#39;s a kind of silly<br/>
task but there is something relaxing about having a defined game to<br/>
play and satisfying about completing it. <br/>
<br/>
Also, I remember reading elsewhere I think on this list about people<br/>
who have these kinds of books around and their kids play with them but<br/>
not necessarily by following the directions. There, unschooling is<br/>
great because no one is going to tell the child they &quot;are doing it wrong&quot;!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248431817">Hi, My name is Ariannah, and I live in Nova Scotia.  I&#39;m married and<br/>
stay at home with 4 of our children ages 5-16.  I saw the Dr. Phil<br/>
episode on unschooling last month (the only Dr. Phil show I&#39;ve ever seen<br/>
in my life), with Dayna and Joe Martin on it.  I was so inspired by it<br/>
that I sought out some groups to join about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I posted a kind of an &quot;intro&quot; hidden in another post, but due to the<br/>
timing and the holiday season and such, I don&#39;t think anybody saw it, so<br/>
I am posting it here, killing two birds with one stone, by responding to<br/>
something that I found interesting here...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My DD is only 2 so I am not saying this from unschooling experience<br/>

&gt; phase of her deschooling or it could be that she likes that kind of work. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Our older 2 (DD16, DS12) have been in school, younger 2 (DD8, DD5) never<br/>
have, and we&#39;ve been unschooling now for 4 years.  Some of the schoolish<br/>
stuff spilled into the 3rd child (DD8) and she requested schoolish<br/>
stuff, so I just bought the worksheet books and busy work, and she at<br/>
first wanted to do it a lot, and now it holds just as much interest as<br/>
many of her other things... she doesn&#39;t see it as necessary but rather<br/>
it&#39;s interesting.  Her friends go to school so for her it keeps up<br/>
appearances, satisfying her need to just do her own thing, while having<br/>
&quot;school stuff&quot; in the house, even if she&#39;s not actively working on it :)<br/>
<br/>
I saw an interesting magazine with Air and Space travel in it and<br/>
thought it was fascinating, and remembered that my son likes it, and<br/>
bought it for him (12, former school student) as a &quot;stocking stuffer&quot;<br/>
for Christmas.  He said, &quot;Thank you for that magazine, it&#39;s very<br/>
educational&quot; (with a slight eyeroll.  Aaaaack!  I hadn&#39;t even thought of<br/>
it in those terms.<br/>
<br/>
I said, &quot;Honey, you don&#39;t have to read it, it&#39;s not &#39;schoolwork&#39;, I just<br/>
got it because it looked interesting.  They don&#39;t use this magazine in<br/>
school.&quot;  4 years later and he&#39;s still sensitive to anything that looks<br/>
like it &quot;contains information&quot; ... I&#39;ve come to understand that for him,<br/>
&quot;educational&quot; is a polite way of him saying, &quot;I don&#39;t want to do this.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But understandably, he got a Nintendo DS for Christmas and that&#39;s the<br/>
highlight of the season for him :)<br/>
<br/>
De-schooling myself has been a big epiphany for me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-10896440">I went through that with my youngest daughter (not the older two-<br/>
just her) when I took her out of school in the first grade. It took <br/>
a bit of time for her to get used to not being told what to learn <br/>
and when to learn it. What I did was help her come up with her OWN <br/>
schedule.  I asked her what SHE would learn if she was her own <br/>
teacher. She said she would like to learn a lot about space, birds, <br/>
Albert Einstein and the weather. She made her own schedule (I don&#39;t <br/>
remember it exactly but she wanted &quot;birds&quot; during the day <br/>
and &quot;space&quot; was at night). It lasted about a month but I think it <br/>
helped her transition from school to unschooling. It&#39;s two years <br/>
later and she still loves learning about space, birds, Albert & the <br/>
weather, just not on a schedule. :-) <br/>

intent. Well, technically, you don&#39;t HAVE to. but if you don&#39;t, they<br/>
will just assign one, like homeschool {last name}. Seeing as though I<br/>
may want my kids to have a diploma from homeschooling (in NC each<br/>
homeschool is considered a private school, so we give our own<br/>
diplomas), I want to make sure I have a name that not only encompasses<br/>
our philosophy of education, but one that will not raise eyebrows or<br/>
suspicions to potential employers/colleges.  This is so far in the<br/>
future to be thinking of it now but unfortunately, you have to pick<br/>
the name when you start homeschooling and can&#39;t change it later...<br/>
