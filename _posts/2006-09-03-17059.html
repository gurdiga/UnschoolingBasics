<div id="ygrps-yiv-751009401">Hi there,<br/>
We are preparing to sit down as a family and do up a budget when DH gets paid next week.  We&#39;ve been flying without one for awhile and it has been a source of stress.  Now that we are moving toward an unschooled life I&#39;ve asked DH if we can firm things up a bit so we know where we stand.  I&#39;d like to know for sure if I can or cannot afford something the girls (8yrs & 4yrs) request so I can feel good without guilt if the answer to a request is yes and I can feel disappointed along with my child, but certain it&#39;s not just arbitrary if the answer needs to be &quot;unfortunately no, not right now, let&#39;s come up with a plan to make it happen in the near future&quot;.  Tandem with the budgeting I&#39;d like to commit to giving my kids their own money to use as they choose.  My question is this, for those of you who have been giving your child money (whatever you might call it -- allowance, spending money, etc) how much do you give them and how did you determine that amount?  At first I was thinking of giving their ages in dollars (2x a month as we get paid {$16 & $8}, or once a month {$8 & $4} , I wasn&#39;t sure), but that seems arbitrary.  Should I ask them and see if we can afford that amount as we budget?  <br/>
<br/>
Of note, we will not be tying this to any sort of chores, it&#39;s just money to have as part of the family.  Also of note we are new still in a rather bumpy transition into an unschooled life and have been struggling with too much freedom and not enough skill/responsibility/whatever to handle it (mostly on the parents part!!!) -- in other words we moved too fast in some areas and it was very frustrating for everyone...I don&#39;t want to do that again with this (not sure if what I&#39;m trying to say is actually coming through in this sentence &lt;sigh&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!!!<br/>
Aimee<br/>

Voices Carnival.  :)  You can read it here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://anunschoolinglife.blogspot.com/">http://anunschoolinglife.blogspot.com/</a>  I do have a post there.<br/>
However, as a quick answer my kids&#39; &quot;allowance&quot; (for lack of a better<br/>
word and it is just one of those mainstream words that we&#39;ve adopted<br/>
for &quot;that time when we give the kids money that is regularly given&quot;)<br/>
is paid every 2 weeks and is based on their ages.  The only reason I<br/>
use their ages is because it seems to correlate with their spending<br/>
needs.  I go more into it in my blog.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-479667575">A lot of people use age as a factor in determining how much money to give<br/>
their kids but I&#39;ve never understood that.  I don&#39;t get less money to spend<br/>
because I am younger than my husband.  <br/>
<br/>
When we started giving our girls allowances (They were young, maybe 2 and 4)<br/>
we gave them the same amount based on what we felt would be enough money for<br/>
them to get to buy something they liked when we went to the store.  It<br/>
wasn&#39;t much (I think we started with $1 a week) but we&#39;re not shoppers and<br/>
by the time we went to a store they usually had a couple dollars at least<br/>
and they were happy to spend it on candy or a small toy.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually we upped it to $2 and then to $4, which I am sure most of you<br/>
think isn&#39;t very much for a 9 and 11 year old but it works for us.  When we<br/>
go to the store on the way somewhere because dh wants a soda or a snack, we<br/>
always offer to get the kids something too.  They don&#39;t need to spend their<br/>
money on candy or drinks or fast food if we are in the car and we&#39;re hungry<br/>
on the way some where.  We give them extra money for the fair or when we are<br/>
on vacation so they can go on rides or buy souvenirs. Dh works on the road<br/>
frequently and he has always liked bringing the girls home a souvenir when<br/>
he is on the road (at least once a month) but if he can&#39;t find something he<br/>
gives them $5 or $10 just because he enjoys it.  It doesn&#39;t take them long<br/>
to save for a $20 or $30 item.<br/>
<br/>
Lilly buys some candy with hers but mostly both girls spend their money on<br/>
horse products. Leigh has several hundred dollars stashed away that she has<br/>
saved.  Sometimes they buy toy horse items and sometimes real horse items<br/>
for their horses.  We pay for everything the horses really need so the items<br/>
the girls buy for the horses are extra things, sometimes treats or a new<br/>
lead rope, halter, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I guess what it boils down to is that the kids are happy with the amount of<br/>
money they have to spend when we do go shopping.  (did I tell you we all<br/>
hate to go shopping unless it&#39;s to the tack store?)  They don&#39;t feel<br/>
deprived and we don&#39;t make them buy everything with their own money or we&#39;d<br/>
have to give them a lot more.  It feels nicer to be able to give them things<br/>
more often than if we gave them a large allowance and made them buy<br/>
everything themselves.  I can give them the amount we do and not feel like<br/>
it&#39;s making a huge dent in the budget.  On weeks where we don&#39;t have as much<br/>
I make sure we have treats in the car so we don&#39;t need to stop and spend<br/>
money on fast food or snacks but we always give them their allowance.<br/>
