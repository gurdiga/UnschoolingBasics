I have 2 other recommendations that I haven&#39;t seen listed.  The first is, <br/>
Deschooling Our LIves, edited by Matt Hern, foreword by Ivan Illich.  The other <br/>
is a wonderful, dog-earred favorite that is more about mindful parenting <br/>
called, The Parent&#39;s Tao Te Ching, by William Martin.  You can be in the most <br/>
stressful moment with your child, and if you stop and just open this little book, <br/>
read ANY passage and you will always be able to bring yourself back to the <br/>
center and remember what matters : )<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Yes that would be Jan Hunt and sadly my mom lost my copy.   I loaned it to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>her because she is now raising my nephew who is almost 4  (like my own ds).  <br/>
I really would like to find another copy of THAT  one! The worst part is that <br/>
I don&#39;t even think she read it  :-( <br/>

Agnes Lestico wrote I Learn Better By Teaching Myself  and  Still Teaching <br/>
Ourselves.  I got both books in one volume from FUN  Books at a discount.  She <br/>
talks about following a childs  interests in learning.  Maybe not strictly <br/>
UNschooling to some on the list  here, the children used some textbooks, but only <br/>
if they wanted to.  Still  an interesting read. Published by Holt GWS.<br/>
 <br/>
In Their Own Way by Thomas Armstrong is also not an unschooling  book.  He <br/>
discusses Gardners theory of multiple intelligences and how  families and <br/>
teachers can use the theory to help kids learn.  He advocates  following a childs <br/>
lead and keeping the stress level low in learning  situations.  Which in turn <br/>
lead me to think that the best way to do this  would be ......UNSCHOOLING!<br/>
 <br/>
George Dennison wrote The Lives of Children describing the First  Street <br/>
School.  The students were a group of challenging poor city kids,  sort of an <br/>
unschooling day school if such a thing is possible.  John Holt  taked about it in <br/>
at least one of his books but I can&#39;t recall which one right  now.  But I <br/>
thought it was really interesting how they let these kids from  different minority <br/>
groups work out their agressions and come to terms with each  other without <br/>
alot of interference.  I have to admit that these kids would  have frightened <br/>
me.  But it helped me to let go of some of the little daily  conflicts that my <br/>
kids get involved in and see that the best was to help kids  resolve their <br/>
comflicts is to let them work through them on their own.   Trust kids.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for the recommendations.  I&#39;m adding them to my list.  I  try to get <br/>
as many books as I can from used book stores, yard sales, ebay.   But I do <br/>
order a couple a month from my local book store.  I use the  library too, but <br/>
sometimes my reading habits don&#39;t always meld with library due  dates.  I&#39;ve been <br/>
reading Magical Child for TEN YEARS now ;-)  <br/>
