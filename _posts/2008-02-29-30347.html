<div id="ygrps-yiv-1039540288">Hi, I would be interested in knowing also how others have dealt with the issue of testing.<br/>
<br/>
I can understand totally  not having anysort of investment in *how* my child scores...My <br/>
concern is rather connected to the fact that my dd5 will have to test period.  In Italy the <br/>
test will probably not be very schematic...they tend to do &quot;interrogations&quot; and &quot;dictations&quot;  <br/>
tho in the past 5 years they have moved more towards annual inclass &quot;quiz&quot;s that observe <br/>
the childs incoming and outgoing knowlege...<br/>
(I know about this as I have older children in school still)<br/>
<br/>
my concern is for easing exam anxiety--<br/>
<br/>
thankyou melissa in italy<br/>
mamma of 7<br/>
dd5 7y, ds6 4yo, and ds7 2yo always unschooled.<br/>
they others in spirit tho not in fact, as I did not knwo that it was actually legal to <br/>
homeschool in italy.<br/>

Find a local group of unschoolers and see how they handle the  <br/>
policies in your area. Policies may be similar in other areas, but  <br/>
you really need the locals who&#39;ve dealt with the particulars to guide  <br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
There are lists of support groups here for Canada:<br/>

<br/>
(If for some reason that doesn&#39;t work go here:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.nhen.org/support/groups/browse.asp<br/>
<br/>
and choose &quot;Not in USA&quot;)<br/>

<br/>
What goes against the fabric of unschooling is to use a test to judge  <br/>
whether our children are learning right. While your district may  <br/>
judge your child based on tests, that doesn&#39;t mean you need to. You  <br/>
just need to follow the letter of the law so you can continue  <br/>
unschooling your kids.<br/>

Exactly. In my experience, HSLDA and groups they support tend to push<br/>
heavily for testing. They LOVE having test scores to show homeschooled<br/>
kids test higher than schooled peers. <br/>
<br/>
In FL I was actively discouraged from looking into an umbrella school.<br/>

those damn test scores. Sheesh.<br/>
<br/>
None of my children have ever taken a test of any kind, up until this<br/>
last year. The first to take a test was my oldest (18) who attended<br/>
his girlfriend&#39;s political science class and took the test just for fun.;)<br/>

What is the testing situation there? Does it have to be given by<br/>
someone else? Here, in NC, we are required to test. Not to pass the<br/>
test, just to give it and have the results on file. I&#39;ve always<br/>
administered the test myself. And by administer, I mean I give the<br/>
test by my rules, no one else&#39;s: I don&#39;t set a timer, I help, we do<br/>
the questions together if they want. (shh. don&#39;t tell anybody that<br/>
last one) There&#39;s no text anxiety, &#39;cause it&#39;s just a piece of paper<br/>
to fill out. Of course, the official recommendation is to have someone<br/>
outside your family give the test, with it being timed, with no<br/>
resources. And I ask you - when else is that the case? When is someone<br/>
completely alone, with no resources except what they remember? Testing<br/>
is bizarre. Well, sure - a surgeon, I wouldn&#39;t really want her in the<br/>
operating room clicking on google - but that&#39;s at *such* a different<br/>
level than most folks operate in, in their daily lives. (clever use of<br/>
operate - didja catch that?)<br/>
<br/>
OK, sorry - back to the question. We are also not required to test<br/>
until they&#39;re required to register as a homeschooler, at age 7. 5 is<br/>
young! So - my question - what are the legal requirements (not<br/>
recommendations) where you live? Maybe we can see how to work within<br/>
those parameters.<br/>

government intrusion into their lives as possible. The idea is that  <br/>
if they can show through tests that there isn&#39;t anything questionable  <br/>
to look into, there won&#39;t be a need for the government to get intrusive.<br/>
<br/>
Which is why unschoolers make HSLDA very nervous! We&#39;re living our  <br/>
lives in a way that challenges the government to prove that our  <br/>
children aren&#39;t learning. ;-) (My end of year report does not look  <br/>
like a list of subjects learned. It looks like a bunch of activities  <br/>
divided up by subject.)<br/>
<br/>
Which is why HSLDA won&#39;t represent unschoolers. And why they won&#39;t  <br/>
give information that might draw a questioning eye from the government.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-650946817">Thankyou Caren, for responding to my post...<br/>
you asked<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  What is the testing situation there? Does it have to be given by<br/>
&gt;  someone else?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What I have been told by other homeschoolers is that testing is not<br/>
required by law unless returning into the public school<br/>
system...however if a principle decides to want testing annually, he<br/>
could make things difficult... though Ive no way of know if this<br/>
actually has happened., nor in what way.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately here in italy it is a very unused schooling option, much<br/>
less unschooling!  The only forum that deals with homeschooling is a<br/>
Christian (7th day adventists) one and their attitude is very much<br/>
like the one described int the Re:Testing in the schoolboard<br/>
thread...they want the government out of their lives as much as<br/>
possible so they do annual testing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Does it have to be given by someone else?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For returning into the school system it is given by the school of acceptance.<br/>
for the annual testing it seems to be also done by the school in the<br/>
area...tho as I say this is all rather fuzzy, law wise, it is NOt done<br/>
so they just ad lib, is my guess!  So I am wondering how I could<br/>
approach this, in a knowlegeable non aggressive way...Id like to *not*<br/>
test if this is possible....and if dd must test, then Id like to do it<br/>
at home, at least.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here, in NC, we are required to test. Not to pass the<br/>

&gt;  last one) There&#39;s no text anxiety, &#39;cause it&#39;s just a piece of paper<br/>
&gt;  to fill out.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Of course this would be ideal, if I had to test.  However, italy does<br/>
not use standardized tests yet.  If they did, she probably wouldnt be<br/>
so scared either, she likes workbookish type questions and<br/>
answers...mainly because she thinks they are funny (she wonders how<br/>
they think up such stupid questions)...<br/>
<br/>
However it will most likely be the usual stuff a dictation, a<br/>
comprehension for reading, some math all with the teachers there (whom<br/>
she has a real fear of...)<br/>
<br/>
Id like to manage this somehow to turn it into a non issue--of course<br/>
the best hope is dialogue with the principle...which I am due to do<br/>
this week---<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And I ask you - when else is that the case? When is someone<br/>

Actually, more and more they are actually using Internet connections<br/>
even in surgery - that way surgeons in remote/rural areas can deal with<br/>
urgent situations without having to hope they can get to the nearest big<br/>
city hospital soon enough. They connect via &quot;meeting&quot; type software<br/>
where the remote surgeon can see and hear what is happening and provide<br/>
instruction and guidance to the surgeon on the scene.<br/>
<br/>
Sure, I wouldn&#39;t want the telephone operator madly googling to find<br/>
something that seemed to match &#39;close enough&#39; to do surgery but an<br/>
already trained surgeon who is not randomly searching but is actively<br/>
connecting to another skilled surgeon, not so big a problem. For that<br/>
matter, most surgeons are not totally alone in the operating room with<br/>
just what they remember - they&#39;ve got a whole surgical team (other<br/>
surgeons, nurses, technicians) who are skilled at what they do and can<br/>
offer insights based on their experience as well.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Why? Are the kids asking for something like this?<br/>
<br/>
Memorizing definitions, even in a fun way, isn&#39;t how people learn  <br/>
words. We build up definitions slowly over time by encountering words  <br/>
in several contexts.<br/>
<br/>
(And, really, that applies to everything. We build up a feel for what  <br/>
everything means and refine it over time. We come up with theories,  <br/>
test them against real life, refine the theories when the don&#39;t quite  <br/>
work.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve dabbled in learning Japanese over the years. By listening to  <br/>
sentences repeated over and over I can spit them back but 90% of it&#39;s  <br/>
just rote. The two words I&#39;ve really gotten a feel for are  <br/>
&quot;sumimasen&quot; (excuse me) which I&#39;ve heard on Heroes and in several  <br/>
movies. That word jumps out from a jumble for me. By seeing how and  <br/>
when it&#39;s used, I&#39;m building up a feeling of it&#39;s meaning piece by  <br/>
piece. (What I mean is, though it can be translated as &quot;excuse me&quot;,  <br/>
it isn&#39;t always used in the same contexts English speakers would use  <br/>
&quot;excuse me&quot;.)<br/>
<br/>
The other word is &quot;ohayo&quot;. On the tapes I hear &quot;konnichiwa&quot; and  <br/>
&quot;ohio&quot; in the same context: in the car at various times of the day.  <br/>
What nailed ohayo and gave it true meaning was hosting a Japanese  <br/>
student for 3 weeks who would great a crowd of  friends each morning  <br/>
as we dropped them off for class with &quot;Ohayo!&quot; and they&#39;d all respond  <br/>
&quot;Ohayo!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When my daughter was 11 we were reading a book and the narrator  <br/>
proudly announced that the town clock frequently told the right time.  <br/>
At 11 she&#39;d certainly heard the word frequently before. And she had  <br/>
built up a feeling for its meaning. But in that context she needed a  <br/>
precise definition to get the joke. So I told her. There, the  <br/>
definition helped because 1) she already had a good handle on the  <br/>
word and how it was used and 2) she wanted the definition for a  <br/>
specific purpose.<br/>
<br/>
Just some things to turn over about how people learn.<br/>
