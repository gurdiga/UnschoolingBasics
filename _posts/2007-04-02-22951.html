<div id="ygrps-yiv-222954590">Dear parents,<br/>
<br/>
I am excited to tell you about the NVC Parent Peer Leadership Program <br/>
(PPLP). If you have any interest in sharing NVC with parents, or if <br/>
you know parents who may be interested in this opportunity, please <br/>
read on or pass this information to other people in your community.<br/>
<br/>
The PPLP is a nine-month program aimed at nurturing and developing <br/>
leaders who are committed to spreading NVC to parents in their <br/>
communities, especially in those regions where there are no NVC <br/>
trainers. The pilot year of this project is nearing completion and <br/>
has been a tremendous success. We are celebrating the growth <br/>
experienced by individual participants, the deepening connection in <br/>
many of their families, and the fact that NVC groups for parents have <br/>
been launched around the U.S. and Canada!<br/>
<br/>
The PPLP is a program of the Peaceful Families, Peaceful World <br/>
Project that I lead for the Center for Nonviolent Communication and <br/>
BayNVC. Brief information is posted below; full details and an <br/>
application packet can be requested by emailing Karin at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:nvcparenting@...">nvcparenting@...</a>.<br/>
<br/>
I hope to meet some of you through this program!<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
<br/>

Parent Peer Leadership Program (PPLP) Information:<br/>
<br/>
The PPLP is a nine-month program aimed at nurturing and developing <br/>
leaders who are committed to spreading NVC to parents in their <br/>
communities, especially in those regions where there are no NVC <br/>
trainers. Through a variety of program components, the PPLP hopes to <br/>
provide parent peer leaders the experience, skills and support they <br/>
need to successfully support other parents who want to learn and <br/>
practice NVC in their families.<br/>
<br/>
The PPLP begins in August 2007 and runs through April 2008. It <br/>
includes a week-long family camp, regularly scheduled teleclasses, <br/>
weekly study suggestions, buddy relationships, and individualized <br/>
tele-support. The only residential aspect of the program is the <br/>
family camp that will take place in Calistoga, Northern California <br/>
from August 13-19. About 20 peer leaders will be selected to <br/>
participate in the program based on a number of different criteria <br/>
including experience and skill with NVC; commitment to living NVC in <br/>
their families; geographical location (with priority given to those <br/>
who cannot easily access opportunities for NVC leadership development <br/>
or training in working with parents); and ability to commit to the <br/>
various program components. We anticipate that most participants will <br/>
be parents, but non-parents who want to focus primarily on sharing <br/>
NVC with parents are also welcome. We estimate that the program will <br/>
involve a 4-8 hour weekly commitment from participants, not including <br/>
the time spent at Family Camp. In addition, our intention is that all <br/>
participants will initiate and lead parent groups focused on empathy <br/>
and NVC practice in their local communities starting together during <br/>
the program (in early 2008) and continuing for at least one year <br/>
after the end of the program. To support their leadership, program <br/>
participants will receive a detailed curriculum and additional <br/>
materials.<br/>
<br/>
Family Camp:<br/>
<br/>
The PPLP family camp will be held from August 13-19 at Mountain Home <br/>
Ranch Retreat, in Calistoga, California. MHRR is about 1 hr. and 15 <br/>
minutes north of San Francisco, and features over 300 acres of hiking <br/>
trails, two swimming pools, a tennis court, basketball, volleyball, <br/>
labyrinth, game room, lake fishing, large fire pit and more. <br/>
Accommodations include rooms or cabins for each family and a few tent <br/>
spaces. See www.mtnhomeranch.com/home.html for more information and <br/>
photos of the site.<br/>
<br/>
The daily schedule at family camp includes structured learning with <br/>
lots of opportunities to play together, eat together, rest and relax. <br/>
Mornings usually find parents in session together while their <br/>
children participate in the Children&#39;s Program led by NVC-trained <br/>
adults (and possibly teens). Although the intention for this time is <br/>
for children and adults to be in separate activities, children will <br/>
have free access to their parents at all times. After lunch and <br/>
empathy groups for the parents we have a few hours of unstructured <br/>
time for families to connect and play together. Evenings include some <br/>
time for everyone to be together to play and do role plays, as well <br/>
as more time for parents and children to engage in separate activities.<br/>
<br/>
Financial Contribution Requested:<br/>
<br/>
The PPLP has three distinct categories of contributions:<br/>
<br/>
PPLP Tuition: We request a $1,100-$2,200 sliding scale tuition <br/>
contribution for the whole 9-month program. This covers <br/>
participantsâ tuition for family camp and all other program <br/>
components.<br/>
<br/>
Family Camp Basic Expenses: Basic Expenses contributions are intended <br/>
to cover lodging and food, facility use, supplies, and miscellaneous <br/>
expenses for the full camp. The contribution we request for Basic <br/>
Expenses varies according to your choice of accommodation and the <br/>
ages of your children. It ranges from $365-560 per adult, and $75-345 <br/>
per child.<br/>
<br/>
Family Camp Tuition: Family Camp tuition contribution is requested <br/>
for family members (children and additional adults who come to attend <br/>
the parentsâ program) who are participating in the camp but who are <br/>
not participating in the PPLP. Family Camp tuition ranges from <br/>
$300-900 per adult and $200-500 per child.<br/>
<br/>
As always, we hope and intend to include applicants regardless of <br/>
ability to pay. In addition to scholarships, we also offer extended <br/>
payment plans and volunteer opportunities. We also encourage people <br/>
to seek support from their local communities and will give applicants <br/>
some ideas for how to do that.<br/>
