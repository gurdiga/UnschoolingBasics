<div id="ygrps-yiv-500152662">This is such a good article. It makes me think of the last place I worked <br/>
before I had my son and decided to stay at home with him.<br/>
<br/>
I worked in the graphics department of a huge multi-national investment bank <br/>
and for years would see droves of the &quot;best and brightest&quot; coming in each <br/>
fall fresh from Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Brown, etc. I watched every year <br/>
for 5 years as fresh-faced 22 year old &quot;kids&quot; would come in and slowly get <br/>
beaten down by the system that had gotten them there. They didn&#39;t know how <br/>
to think beyond very narrow parameters, yet the employer wanted creative <br/>
thinkers, they were afraid to stand up to their authority figures and <br/>
disagree or negotiate, etc., yet doing that would have helped move them <br/>
ahead in the company.  They would work 48 hours straight at times, losing <br/>
sleep, not seeing loved ones or significant others, canceling vacations, <br/>
etc., and then I would catch some of them crying (both genders, by the way) <br/>
in the hallways or break rooms because they were at their breaking point. <br/>
Very few of them lasted beyond their 2 year commitment. Many of them left to <br/>
follow &quot;undesirable&quot; (read: low paying) pursuits such as art or dancing or <br/>
teaching, but those who came to these decisions left floating on a cloud <br/>
because they realized they were finally free of what they had been preparing <br/>
for all their lives.<br/>
<br/>
At times I wonder what my son will end up choosing to do for a career, but I <br/>
would never wish this sort of a path on him - no matter what the salary <br/>
might be.<br/>
