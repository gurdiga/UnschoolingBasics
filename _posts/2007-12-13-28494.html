<div id="ygrps-yiv-1794116093">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
My child support didn&#39;t come this month and I&#39;m guessing this is how<br/>
it&#39;s going to be throughout 2008. So, I need to figure out a way to<br/>
make more money. I have a Ford Explorer and want to solicit<br/>
advertisers to put an ad on my car for a monthly fee. Because we are<br/>
an unschooling family, I think it would be appropriate to have a<br/>
related ad on our car. Does anybody have any suggestions on where I<br/>
should start?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any suggestions.</div>

Unschooling doesn&#39;t sell well. &lt;g&gt; There&#39;s no money in it. &lt;G&gt; We all <br/>
do this for the love of unschooling!<br/>
<br/>
Many homeschooling curriculum businesses are homeschooling family <br/>
owned, and budgets there are tight (they choose that business so that <br/>
they can spend more time together, not to make a fortune!).<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of businesses that you can do as a family though. What <br/>
are your interests?<br/>

My goodness...us too. My former DH lost his job due to the Writer&#39;s Strike  <br/>
and yeah...nada. Just wanted to send some care and understanding - and hope! I  <br/>
know it&#39;s here somewhere... ;) I&#39;m looking for cool ideas on what to DO to <br/>
bring  in money while still maintaining the way we live (me home with the <br/>
Littles) as  best as possible. We&#39;re going to do great, I&#39;m sure! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-272314624">Kelly asked what my interests are.<br/>
<br/>
First, thanks for replying Kelly. Sad to say that I don&#39;t have very<br/>
many interests because I&#39;m so busy caring for my two special needs<br/>
children. My oldest is seven years old. I don&#39;t have any support from<br/>
my family. I moved out when I was a teenager. THAT was a long long<br/>
time ago ;-) <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been pretty resourceful for the past seven years making this work<br/>
as a single, unschooling mom. I just need to get past this unexpected<br/>
bump in the road.</div>

I, due the suggestions of others here (THANK YOU!!!!!!!!),  got the book The <br/>
Uncollege Alternative. I STRONGLY suggest you do  the same. It opened up my <br/>
eyes (I read almost all of it in a day, lol) to so  many ideas! And there are <br/>
wonderful quizzes in there to help you see the  interests you have that you may <br/>
not be aware of. I usually am not into the  quizzes, but these were really, <br/>
truly helpful. If you can get your hands on  that, I&#39;d eat my hat if 1) I had <br/>
one ;) and 2) if it didn&#39;t help in some  powerful way. If you can&#39;t find or <br/>
afford it, let me know. I&#39;ll share, ok? <br/>

We just so happen to be planning a visit to the library tomorrow. I&#39;ll<br/>
grab a copy if they have it.<br/>

Thank you.</div>
