<div id="ygrps-yiv-1225008470">&quot;Why? And what is left in the magazine for unschoolers? I see <br/>
basically nothing<br/>
left.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As far as I&#39;m concerned, HEM was never an unschooling magazine...but <br/>
at least it had an unschooling columnist with occasional unschooling <br/>
articles thrown in.<br/>
Now there&#39;s NO reason for me to subscribe. I&#39;m cancelling tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
I suggest the new &quot;Live Free, Learn Free&quot; for unschooling articles <br/>
and support.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1566217184">&quot;I&#39;ll be checking out Life Learning Magazine&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Oh yes!! Thank you for mentioning that one too Kelli. I have really <br/>
enjoyed the two copies of Life Learning I&#39;ve had. I need to <br/>
subscribe to that one..it&#39;s good. Very geared for <br/>
unschoolers/autodidacts of all ages. More along the lines of GWS.<br/>

I wrote cancelling mine today -- even asked for a refund, since I just subbed for 2yrs in March.  I don&#39;t want their mag in my house thru Feb &#39;06.  I can read it for free at my favorite bookstore, if I happen to see anything interesting.  I wonder if I could convince that bookstore to sell either of the other two?<br/>

I subscribed to Life Learning in March, and I love it!  So much better than HEM, not just in the unschooling sense, but in its support for gentle parenting as well.  <br/>
 <br/>
The only recent article I wasn&#39;t crazy about was the one where the editor recommended limiting computer for kids.  It was very refreshing to see her re-think her position after hearing from readers!  <br/>
