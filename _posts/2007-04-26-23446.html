-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yikes!!<br/>
<br/>
This is w hat I&#39;ve pulled from her blog, with my responses:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Kids who are radical unschoolers watch whatever they want, and as much <br/>
as they want on TV, all the time.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Add yet Duncan had two other unschooled boys (11 years old) here all <br/>
day who were outside role-playing now for 9 hours---only stopping to <br/>
est when I took food out. Complete freedom to watch TV all day or play <br/>
video games all day---yet they were outside role-playing. Go figure.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
They spend as much time as they want on the computer.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yep---and yet there they were in the yard.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
They eat whatever they want all the time.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yep---but they had panini sandwiches for lunch; a monkey platter with <br/>
carrots & cukes with hummus, crackers & cheese, sliced ham, and ants on <br/>
a log for snack; and lasagne for supper. Cupckes are sitting and <br/>
sitting, and the candy bowl is full.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
They are not required to contribute to the running of the household <br/>
unless they want to.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And yet all three helped move garbage to the curb without being asked.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t even have to pick up their toys off the livingroom floor <br/>
unless they feel like it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And yet they DO---happily and sweetly!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They can go to bed whenever they want.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And are quiet while others sleep, and they sleep until rested.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And from what I read, they also have the right to refuse when their <br/>
grandmother, who needs a walker to get around, asks them to get her <br/>
something from another room.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
They *can* but they DON&#39;T. She can&#39;t seem to wrap her head around all <br/>
her roadblocks. She thinks they won&#39;t do *any* of these things if they <br/>
have a choice. Mine CHOOSE to do these things because they *want* to.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I expect my children to eat the nutritious foods I provide for them. I <br/>
expect them to stop watching TV and playing computer games when they <br/>
start to ignore other things that they have previously enjoyed doing. I <br/>
expect them to do their share of the household chores, since I&#39;m not a <br/>
slave. I expect them to go to bed at an hour which will assure they get <br/>
enough rest. And I certainly expect them to respect not only their <br/>
elders, but all other people, simply by virtue of the fact that we all <br/>
share the same planet.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I expect all that too, but mine do it out of respect and trust and <br/>
generosity.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And for all this, I &quot;have no right&quot; to call myself an unschooler. Well, <br/>
if that&#39;s what being an unschooler means, then I don&#39;t want to! So <br/>
these days I call us &quot;self-directed learners&quot;, hoping that it conveys <br/>
what we are about without the negative connotation that radical <br/>
unschoolers have given the word &quot;unschoolers&quot;, to pretty much everyone <br/>
who is not one.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
GOOD. Because I don&#39;t want her saying she&#39;s an unschooler if she can&#39;t <br/>
see through her Dr Phil/John Rosemond-colored glasses.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  I have to admit that I also avoid associating with radicals since <br/>
these kids, in my experience, do not have the respect for others that I <br/>
expect from my children.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
MY children have more respect in their little fingers,.....<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And one of the good things about homeschooling is that I can (somewhat) <br/>
control the time frame in which my kids are exposed to different things.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Lalalalalalalalal...she&#39;s not listening....Lalalalalalalalala<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Control&quot; is the key word, guys!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One day, when I was having kind of a tense cranky day, I tripped over  <br/>
a bin of Legos in the living room and they spilled everywhere. I  <br/>
thought my head would explode--it was one of those days when you  <br/>
react to some spilled Legos as if the house is burning down, kwim? I  <br/>
was on my way to do something that couldn&#39;t wait--pee urgently,  <br/>
maybe?--so I didn&#39;t stop to pick them up right away. A few minutes  <br/>
later, as I came back into the room, I heard my 5-year-old saying,  <br/>
&quot;If we pick these up, it will really help Mama, even though she&#39;s the  <br/>
one who spilled them.&quot; And there were my 5yo and my 2yo, picking up  <br/>
the Legos. They did a great job, too. I thanked them and said, &quot;I was  <br/>
having a cranky day, and it really did help that you picked them up  <br/>
for me.&quot; And they hugged me.<br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t pick up their toys every day. A lot of times my partner  <br/>
and I do it. But moments like that--when they do it on their own, for  <br/>
their own reasons, or to be kind to me--make the freedom we&#39;ve given  <br/>
them worth it. If kids are obedient all the time from fear of  <br/>
punishment, how possible is it for them to offer an amazing gift like  <br/>
that? If I think they have a duty to pick up the toys all the time,  <br/>
how possible is it for me to receive a gift like that?<br/>
<br/>
I have a lot of questions now that I&#39;m an unschooler. Questions like,  <br/>
&quot;How do they ever know what &#39;enough&#39; feels like if they&#39;re only ever  <br/>
allowed four ounces of juice or an hour of TV at a time? If I&#39;m  <br/>
imposing rules all the time, I never get to see that my kids can be  <br/>
thoughtful, independent, creative, problem-solving, and sweet. If I  <br/>
force vegetables, I never get to see that sometimes my kids will eat  <br/>
nothing but lima beans for dinner because the lima beans taste so  <br/>
good to them (and other days, nothing but bread or nothing but meat,  <br/>
but you take my point).<br/>

<br/>
Last spring, we were on a road trip (Ben and a friend, Stewart, cycled <br/>
the Natchez Trace while the boys and I SAGGed in the minivan). We <br/>
stopped at a Cracker Barrel for lunch on the way home after the ride. <br/>
Ben and I ordered sloppy hamburgers while Cameron ordered a Cobb salad <br/>
and Duncan ordered the vegetable plate. The irony wasn&#39;t lost on us! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Both LOVE lima beans and spinach and collards and raw fish---typically <br/>
kid-unfriendly foods. But they&#39;ve never been forced to eat anything <br/>
they found yucky. We like many different foods, and we just offer LOTS <br/>
of different choices all the time.<br/>
<br/>
Having babysat for many children who were *very* picky eaters, I <br/>
decided early I was NOT going to force-feed my children. Never had a <br/>
problem. Go figure!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-239345607">Yes, Ren, that was a wonderful response. I am nearly ashamed to admit that not much more <br/>
than two years ago I was right there as well. I&#39;m not quite ashamed though, because we&#39;ve <br/>
allowed ourselves to be brainwashed by the pure amount of nonsense spouted by so-called <br/>
professionals and old-wives tales coming from our grannies. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t even consider myself radical. I&#39;m still losing it too often to do so, but everything she <br/>
said I had a response &quot;She should spend a day at MY house&quot; I have great kids, I have kids that <br/>
would choose to help. I have kids who decline to help and it is not one bit different than my <br/>
husband or myself saying, in a minute, or not right now. But somehow our little guys are <br/>
supposed to be held to a higher standard? Because of their age? Ridiculous!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-964532335">Forgot to say, she hasn&#39;t lived the life! If she had given it a chance, then she would have <br/>
seen all the nonsense spouting from her mouth. Because I *have* lived the life, and in less <br/>
than two years, seen our family grow and thrive from radical unschooling (or at least our <br/>
consistent striving to do so)<br/>
She really is not seeing the whole picture. Her perspective is one in which children are <br/>
required to be minions, and that learning without structure is enough, but living without <br/>
limits is not possible. I don&#39;t feel defensive, whenever I read something like that, I <br/>
remember what Sandra Dodd says in response to these types of rants...&quot;We&#39;re not selling <br/>
it!&quot;  No one has to buy it, we&#39;re not suffereing by people not getting it, but they surely are.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-781354278">***What do people think about the points she makes<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
She writes that she trusts her kids and she writes that she can&#39;t trust <br/>
them.  (they might enslave her, they might eat too much, they might not <br/>
sleep, etc.)<br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone has to worry much about her blog.  From her writing she <br/>
clearly never understood unschooling.  She seems defensive, so I&#39;m guessing <br/>
she had her beliefs challenged on one of the lists and felt hurt by that.<br/>
<br/>
So, she really makes no point.  She revealed she didn&#39;t meet the example of <br/>
radical unschooler she saw at some of the lists and now she&#39;s saying &quot;Oh, <br/>
yeah, well, I didn&#39;t want to be a radical unschooler anyway. So there. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;ll get over it and move on.<br/>

(We&#39;ve only been unschooling since Oct, 2006, lol)  I have found my son<br/>

<br/>
Careful! The way I&#39;ve been &quot;jetsetting&quot; lately may find me at your <br/>
doorstep! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve done a lot of sushi suppers. I love to have a lot of kids over <br/>
who are wary of such foods. When they get to make it themselves, <br/>
they&#39;re more likely to actually eat it! Plus, they can add what appeals <br/>
to them in whatever amounts they find appetizing.<br/>
<br/>
Ren&#39;s son Trevor is a &quot;meat & potatoes&quot; kind of guy, and Ren doubted <br/>
he&#39;d eat it. He made several maki rolls AND ate them! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ren made us some incredible spring rolls that I&#39;ve since been craving. <br/>
Maybe we need another trip to the market....<br/>
<br/>
And the trips to the Asian markets are a hoot---so many things we&#39;ve <br/>
never seen! And Duncan and his crowd love to wander the candy aisles <br/>
looking for foods they&#39;ve seen in anime shows. In fact, the other day <br/>
we picked up a special vegetable dumpling he&#39;s been wanting. Today&#39;s <br/>
lunch!<br/>

We&#39;re about 45 minutes from the main airport (Bradley International - <br/>
it shows up as Hartford, CT but is actually about 15-20 minutes of <br/>
that fair (not) city). We&#39;re getting &quot;rolling&quot; around 5<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1420014934">I had to laugh about the sushi posts... my 12 yr old daughter(special<br/>
needs.. autism spectrum)  just spent a week in the hospital after<br/>
scoliosis surgery.. for several days she was on IV fluids and then a<br/>
liquid diet.  On the &quot;switchover&quot; day the surgeon came in and asked<br/>
her if she was hungry...she said yeah a little... he then asked what<br/>
she would like to eat...boy was he shocked to hear her say &quot;sushi&quot;!!!<br/>
  He said he was sure that was the first time he had heard that from a<br/>
kid!   She even made sushi with her therapist this past year while<br/>
they worked on some of her life skills by learning to cook and then<br/>
made a cookbook.  I think the therapist also was surprised that she<br/>
liked sushi.   <br/>

controlling hospital environment!!! UGH!)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1000937393">That is GREAT! I love it. I know we&#39;ve become &quot;noticeable&quot; at the sushi<br/>
place we like because we&#39;d often sit right at the sushi bar and there<br/>
are few people under 18 sitting there and eating sushi (and DS has just<br/>
decided he likes sashimi as well, just leave out the wasabi &quot;killer<br/>
playdough&quot; lol) There&#39;s nothing more fun than food you can play with -<br/>
and making sushi is just that.<br/>
 <br/>
For my next project, I&#39;m contemplating how to make soap sushi - mixing<br/>
up different colors of the soap base and making sheets that I can cut<br/>
and form together to make soaps that look like nigiri or California<br/>
rolls or whatever. Still not expert enough for it yet, though, need more<br/>
practice with mixed forms.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1394172773">Well, if I do figure it out and it comes out even halfway decent, <br/>
I&#39;ll let you know. Obviously, it will NOT be fish-scented.LOL DH and <br/>
I were discussing it, and he has some interesting ideas about how to <br/>
go about it. Plus, I&#39;ve got a beginner book thing on soap making <br/>
that shows/explains how to make layered soaps which will likely come <br/>
in handy in getting the various layers to stay together.<br/>
