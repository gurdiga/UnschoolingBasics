<div id="ygrps-yiv-277042981">Join Carolina Homeschooler in October or November as we take <br/>
our fourth and fifth trips to Washington DC. (We had so much <br/>
interest last year, we&#39;re organizing two trips again this year!)<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re planning to tour the various memorials and monuments, <br/>
White House, Old Post Office Pavilion and Tower, Arlington <br/>
Cemetery, US Capitol, Library of Congress, Bureau of Engraving <br/>
and Printing, the Holocaust Museum, the Pentagon, Ford&#39;s Theater, <br/>
and Union Station. We&#39;ll also have the opportunity to visit <br/>
Smithsonian museums such as: Air and Space Museum, Museum of <br/>
Natural History, Museum of American History (recently reopened <br/>
after renovations), Museum of the American Indian, and others of <br/>
your choice.<br/>
<br/>

These trips filled quickly last year, so please register as soon as <br/>
you&#39;re certain you&#39;d like to go. We&#39;ll keep a waiting list once we&#39;ve <br/>
reached our maximum. The registration deadline for this trip is <br/>
August 15.<br/>
