<div id="ygrps-yiv-1891389705">As I mentioned in a previous post, one benefit of moving in with my<br/>
parents is that we have high speed wireless internet here.  My mother<br/>
got  10 y/o Draven a 1 year XBox live gold membership for Christmas<br/>
this year, along with a headset.  Up until about 2 days ago we<br/>
couldn&#39;t figure out why the headset wasn&#39;t working right, and then we<br/>
realized he was set on the wrong &quot;parental control&quot; setting and now it<br/>
works great.<br/>
<br/>
This is both a positive and a negative thing, in my opinion.  Before<br/>
he was playing online with others, but not verbally chatting with<br/>
them.  I really don&#39;t mind the &quot;shoot em up&quot; games he plays, although<br/>
some are a bit too bloody for me to watch for long.  Now he&#39;s<br/>
alternating between laughing into the headset as he chats with online<br/>
buddies, calmly discussing strategic plans, and sometimes screaming<br/>
things that make me a little uncomfortable.  We don&#39;t forbid cussing,<br/>
however we&#39;ve asked that he use it respectfully, by not cussing around<br/>
those that wouldn&#39;t approve (my parents as an example) and by not<br/>
cussing at people (we really ask that he not call anyone names at all,<br/>
but especially not degrading names).  I&#39;ve talked to him about the way<br/>
he speaks to others through the headset, reminding him that they are<br/>
real people, with real feelings, and of all different age groups.  His<br/>
response is basically that he only does it if others are doing it, and<br/>
that since he&#39;s only chatting with team mates, it&#39;s all in good fun.<br/>
Since we left a lot of his friends behind, and he hasn&#39;t reconnected<br/>
with many of his &quot;real life&quot; friends here, I&#39;m glad he&#39;s making<br/>
friends online.<br/>
<br/>
I actually just realized that he&#39;s been playing and chatting online<br/>
with the same group of people for about 12 hours straight.  I think<br/>
that&#39;s wonderful!  I also just realized he hadn&#39;t eaten any &quot;real<br/>
food&quot; during that time so I took a break from writing this and made<br/>
him some easy finger food for a meal.<br/>
<br/>
I am wondering how others have handled this online game play.  For<br/>
some reason where I had no issues with him text chatting online, I&#39;m a<br/>
little more uncomfortable with the voice chat, especially since a<br/>
headset is involved and I can&#39;t hear what&#39;s being said to him.  I<br/>
don&#39;t want to forbid it, or even restrict it, but I&#39;m wondering how to<br/>
work through my own unease.<br/>
<br/>
Also, since we began unschooling (18 months ago or so) I&#39;ve made it<br/>
routine that when I ask for his help with something and he&#39;s playing a<br/>
video game I typically say &quot;Can you help me with X when you get to a<br/>
save point, or when you finish the level?&quot;  Now he&#39;s pretty much<br/>
non-stop chatting with his online friends and I don&#39;t like<br/>
interrupting the conversation, but I do have to ask him either for<br/>
help with something, or what he would like for his next meal<br/>
throughout the day.  Has anyone found a good way to get their child&#39;s<br/>
attention while they&#39;re online gaming, without becoming the<br/>
&quot;interrupting mom&quot; that&#39;s disrupting his game play?<br/>
<br/>
Also, if there are any unschoolers that might like to trade screen<br/>
names (gamer id&#39;s, whatever they&#39;re called now) with my son, let me<br/>
know and I&#39;ll ask him if he&#39;s interested in that.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any and all advice!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1865300444">Draven has been asked to move from his home and his friends. He complied. He&#39;s <br/>
now living in a much smaller space with more limitations on his behaviour. He&#39;s <br/>
living with your mom and your sick step-dad and he&#39;s finding joy in new <br/>
relationships with folks on the Xbox. Give it to him. Give it to him and more. <br/>
Be generous with this more than generous child of yours. Think about how sweetly <br/>
he is accommodating you and your needs. Try and see it as part of how he is <br/>
dealing with a radical change in his life and make it easier and better for him. <br/>
Try not to ask for his help for a while. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Is part of the problem about the fact that you are also having to change your <br/>
life? You are also living in a more confined way, a more circumspect way with <br/>
your mom and your sick step-dad? Maybe if you can factor that into how you <br/>
assess your difficulties, recognise your own additional stress, you may feel <br/>
less that this is about him and that it is contextual for you as well. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think you may have to figure out how to get over the swearing thing. These <br/>
games are totally intense and playing them with buddies on-line, well, the <br/>
swearing and the shouting and the saying things, man that&#39;s just part of the <br/>
deal. Simon says that it&#39;s part of the game, part of what makes it fun. Simon <br/>
said his best experience when playing was while playing Black Ops there was a <br/>
little boy singing. It seems Draven is aware of who he&#39;s playing with and when <br/>
it&#39;s appropriate. Simon and Linnaea have the same kind of skill. Breathe and be <br/>
kind and generous and relax, he&#39;s adapting to your newly implemented changes. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>*** I would trust him to navigate it. Our then 7 year old  tried out a few<br/>
things when Xbox live was new to him. I don&#39;t mean don&#39;t discuss your<br/>
feelings when he does something that hurts you but trust him.<br/>
<br/>
Easy, 8 sometimes constantly chatters, chants or sings, at first I worried<br/>
that it would bother people. It does to some but not others. He has only had<br/>
one bad experience when an adult called him some unkind names. he simply<br/>
said you are name calling and my mother can hear everything you are saying.<br/>
The dude dropped out of the game. So it wasn&#39;t even that bad. I just<br/>
happened to be in the room . we laughed at how silly the guy was and blocked<br/>
him from being able to play with Easy again.<br/>
<br/>
We were in a place where there were very limited people for Easy (and my<br/>
other kids) to hang out and play with. Online friends really.<br/>

uneasy?<br/>
<br/>
One thing that helped me is to listen to the chatting a little. Mine was<br/>
very little so he didn&#39;t feel that was obtrusive at all. If he were older I<br/>
may have asked him what kind of stuff they tall about and just listen.<br/>

This is new and huge and exciting.<br/>

me and I will give you Easy&#39;s. He loves new xbox friends.<br/>
