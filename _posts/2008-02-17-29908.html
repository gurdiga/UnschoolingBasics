<div id="ygrps-yiv-1923242240">Thank you, Deb.  I&#39;ve been surprised by some of what I&#39;ve seen on <br/>
this list lately, but I&#39;ve stayed here because even though I don&#39;t <br/>
intentionally allow negativity into my life - and many of the recent <br/>
messages here felt very negative Â– I am new and searching for <br/>
answers, ideas and information on how this works for other families.  <br/>
I am learning from the wisdom of some of the veteran unschoolers <br/>
ideas and suggestions, and I look forward to more of this.   <br/>
<br/>
Like Beth, (her message was: Does age matter when moving into <br/>
unschooling lifestyle?), any insight, ideas, and wisdom that can be <br/>
shared relative to beginning the unschooling journey with a child at <br/>
10 and above would be so helpful to me.  I&#39;m vacillating, just like <br/>
Beth, with unschooling my almost 11 yo.  Although unschooling feels <br/>
right and I see the benefits in my son, I still have doubts.  We have <br/>
been &quot;unschooling&quot; for about 3 weeks now (although we have dabbled <br/>
with it at times, and I have been reading about it for awhile) and I <br/>
find myself wanting to &quot;do math&quot; with a structured program, and other <br/>
subjects. I&#39;m struggling with &quot;quantifying&quot; what he is learning <br/>
through out the day.   Any tips, suggestions or books that anyone can <br/>
recommend to help me with this would be greatly appreciated!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-408290488">Age matters, but not in ways you might think.<br/>
<br/>
There IS going to be some healing that has to take place in an older  <br/>
child. School does damage - even to kids who are seemingly successful  <br/>
in school and even more so in kids who have had negative schooling  <br/>
experiences. So you have to expect to be patient, there can be some  <br/>
negative stuff that comes up in the first year or so after getting  <br/>
them out of school. It might sort of break your heart, but if you  <br/>
expect it, you can recognize it and be prepared to handle it with  <br/>
equanimity. I&#39;m talking about things like a child who just stops  <br/>
reading altogether - doesn&#39;t pick up a book on their own, for example.  <br/>
Parents will come here and say, &quot;At least when he was in school he did  <br/>
read. Now he just wants to play video games all day and night.&quot; Or,  <br/>
they&#39;ll complain that the kids fight too much or want to watch tv too  <br/>
much, etc. Kids that never go to school and are not schooled at home,  <br/>
never have to go through the deschooling process.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, my oldest daughter was in school through 4th grade  <br/>
and she&#39;s now 23. She says that taking her out of school was the most  <br/>
empowering thing I could have done and that that experience made her  <br/>
realize that her life is HER life - that there is always a choice,  <br/>
that it is always up to her to be in charge of her own life. Up until  <br/>
we said, &quot;No more going to school,&quot; she says she felt like, as a kid,  <br/>
her life path was not her own responsibility. And she has an awareness  <br/>
- she KNOWS what we got her out of and she is extremely grateful and  <br/>
appreciative. In other words, there can be more conscious awareness of  <br/>
what they&#39;re getting with unschooling, and that&#39;s kind of nice.<br/>
<br/>
There are most definitely some things the schooled kids have to  <br/>
unlearn, though, and it takes time and experience. For example,  <br/>
they&#39;ve usually got the idea that learning only happens when they do  <br/>
lessons. They often think learning only counts if it is &quot;hard.&quot; Or if  <br/>
it is tested and graded.<br/>
<br/>
It can help to give them some input about unschooling, if they are at  <br/>
all interested. Teens might want to read the first half of Grace  <br/>
Llewelyn&#39;s book, &quot;The Teen-Age Liberation Handbook.&quot; (The second half  <br/>
is more of a reference - ways to learn things they might want to learn  <br/>
- great ideas.)<br/>
<br/>
Be aware that they might have weird ideas about why you&#39;re unschooling  <br/>
- I&#39;ve heard lots of people say they found out later that the kids  <br/>
thought they were not smart enough for school.<br/>
<br/>
And, be really sensitive to their concerns - make sure they have  <br/>
plenty of chance to let you know what they are worried about. Take the  <br/>
concerns seriously even when you know that the things they&#39;re worried  <br/>
about won&#39;t end up to be a problem. If a kid says he&#39;s worried he  <br/>
won&#39;t ever be able to go to college, respond with real information,  <br/>
don&#39;t just brush it off saying, &quot;Oh, you will, don&#39;t worry.&quot; Social  <br/>
concerns are common - take those serously, too - don&#39;t brush them  <br/>
aside. Make a calendar, set dates for getting together with friends,  <br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
And, finally, what other option do you really have? If you&#39;ve come to  <br/>
realize that schooling is harmful, are you going to leave them in just  <br/>
because you didn&#39;t figure that out sooner? Get them out before there  <br/>
is more harm done.<br/>
<br/>
And, to reassure you, some of the most awesome unschooled teens and  <br/>
young adults I know were kids who were taken out of school in later  <br/>
childhood or in their teens. You&#39;re setting them free - how can that  <br/>
possibly not be a good thing?<br/>

Pam, I&#39;m so glad you responded.  When you say &#39;school does damage&#39; <br/>
are you referring to any type of schooling even school at home?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is where we fall short.  We simply do not have many friends.  <br/>
In fact, my dd9&#39;s #1 reason for returning to school was loneliness <br/>
and boredom.  I tried finding activities for her but it never seemed <br/>
like enough.  She wanted to be with kids all day long every day.  <br/>
She still loves to do things so we&#39;re trying once again to find her <br/>
lots of things to do.  We&#39;ve tried networking but it&#39;s getting <br/>
harder as they get older.  They don&#39;t like park days anymore, <br/>
especially most of the kids are so young!<br/>

the transition.  It&#39;s going to be me and DH!  <br/>
<br/>
But thanks for responding.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Kelly,<br/>
My son likes to play games on his computer (neopets mostly-his goal <br/>
is to save up to 14 million neopoints.), communicate with other kids <br/>
on the Neopets boards, play with our dog, play with friends, playing <br/>
outside, and go to archery class(Jr Olympic Development program).  He <br/>
dabbles in html code and has his own pet care business (walking dogs <br/>
mostly).  He hates driving in the car (because we are from Maine <br/>
originally and drive back there often from Vermont), so getting him <br/>
to leave the house is difficult.  Unless of course, he&#39;s going to a <br/>
friend&#39;s house!<br/>
<br/>
One of the biggest challenges I face is helping my husband see (and <br/>
later this year, the State of Vermont) that we are learning - all the <br/>
time.  It&#39;s important to my husband that our son learn and stay <br/>
current with what a &quot;typical 5th grader&quot; is learning in the schools. <br/>
He comes from a strong collegiate background, and his point is that <br/>
he wants us to approach education so that our son will be able to get <br/>
into the college of his choice someday, if he chooses. <br/>
<br/>
The other big challenge is ME!  I feel like I need to present <br/>
learning in more creative ways to our son.  I think that if &quot;I do it <br/>
right&quot;, he will want to review math facts with me or provide some <br/>
writing samples (which he is completely resistant to!) for his <br/>
portfolio.<br/>
<br/>
Any help/suggestions/tips would be great!<br/>
txs,<br/>

shelf. That might be enough to comfort your husband &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
But, if you do have to compromise with him (compromise is better than  <br/>
putting your son in school, better than fully schooling at home,  <br/>
better than divorcing your husband, better than lots of things),  <br/>
having your son read a little from the 5th grader book would maybe  <br/>
satisfy your dh.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m NOT suggesting that unschooled kids need to do something like this  <br/>
- just suggesting it as an option in place of caving in to demands  <br/>
that he does formal schooling.<br/>

what he&#39;s learning. Think about whether he is having a good time.<br/>

One of the biggest challenges I face is helping my husband see (and<br/>
later this year, the State of Vermont) that we are learning - all the<br/>
time.  It&#39;s important to my husband that our son learn and stay<br/>
current with what a &quot;typical 5th grader&quot; is learning in the schools.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Why? Why is that important?<br/>
<br/>
Can he actually answer that?<br/>
<br/>
==-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
He comes from a strong collegiate background,<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
yeah---me too.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
and his point is that<br/>
he wants us to approach education so that our son will be able to get<br/>
into the college of his choice someday, if he chooses.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And his scenario is that your son does what they do in school? So why <br/>
don&#39;t you just put him in school? I mean---what&#39;s the reason to <br/>
homeschool him? To offer him the same thing that schools offer kids? <br/>
Why would that help his chances to get into college?<br/>
<br/>
So here you have the opportunity to offer your child sooo much more <br/>
than school, yet you&#39;re giving him no more than school can. You&#39;re <br/>
choosing to have his application into college to look exactly like the <br/>
other 12 billion kids who apply to colleges each year.<br/>
<br/>
What would help him actually stand out as a great college candidate? A <br/>
transcript? Like everyone else?<br/>
Or passion? and a portfolio? and work experience?<br/>
<br/>
What if he decides college isn&#39;t for him? Will you be disappointed? <br/>
What will all that school work be worth then? Wouldn&#39;t it make more <br/>
sense to delve into passions NOW fully and completely and simply keep <br/>
that love of learning alive and well? Forever?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
The other big challenge is ME!  I feel like I need to present<br/>
learning in more creative ways to our son.<br/>
<br/>
=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe. What are you doing already?<br/>
<br/>
But really, learning is learning. It doesn&#39;t need to be &quot;presented.&quot; It <br/>
just needs to be *allowed* to happen. School shuts DOWN so much <br/>
learning because the teachers are so busy *teaching*.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
 I think that if &quot;I do it<br/>
right&quot;, he will want to review math facts with me or provide some<br/>
writing samples (which he is completely resistant to!) for his<br/>
portfolio.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Yeah---probably not.<br/>
<br/>
Did you?<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t you think your teachers spent a lot of time planning their <br/>
classroom time? How much did *you* retain? Did you look forward to <br/>
reviewing math facts?<br/>
<br/>
You mean he doesn&#39;t write at all? On the computer?<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling doesn&#39;t mean that he will suddenly start doing what looks <br/>
like school. It means that *you*, the parent, needs to start seeing the <br/>
learning that is already happening and translate that into <br/>
&quot;educationese.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Quit pushing and start LOOKING. The learning&#39;s happening. Every day.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2001010327">Thanks, Kelly. I appreciate your candor and the time you took to <br/>
reply to my post.  It is helping me &quot;see&quot; that I do need to open my <br/>
eyes and observe the learning that&#39;s taking place.  My son writes on <br/>
boards with his friends much of the day, and he is learning and <br/>
creating and having FUN in the process.  He is an amazingly sweet <br/>
child and I would not trade the time we have together for anything.<br/>
<br/>
This brief, initial period of unschooling has allowed me to enjoy our <br/>
homeschool experience more than I imagined possible, and I know that <br/>
echoes true for our son, as well.  All by itself that says so much, <br/>
doesn&#39;t it.<br/>
<br/>
I just received a copy of The Unschooling Unmanual.  It&#39;s beautiful.  <br/>
Thanks for mentioning it in an earlier post.<br/>
