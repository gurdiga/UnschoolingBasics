I love the online public encyclopedia www.Wikipedia.org and for most issues<br/>
or image needs I just use the increasingly wonderful Google.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-918976362">Wikipedia is great like Robyn said, when my kids were<br/>
smaller they uses AskJeeves for kids all by<br/>
themselves. Our biggest problem is them asking<br/>
questions when for some reason we can&#39;t stop and look<br/>
something up. So we have a chalkboard and they write<br/>
their questions there for later research, this way we<br/>
don&#39;t forget. ELISA <br/>

<br/>
Encyclopedias go out of date too quickly, I &quot;google&quot; most things I want <br/>
to know more about!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-530629033">When my 4 year old ask a question that I don&#39;t know<br/>
the answer to, I almost always go to the internet<br/>
(versus going to the library).  Most of the time I<br/>
just go to google and find the answer and then explain<br/>
it to him.  Sometimes he will come to the computer<br/>
with me and we will look up the answer together.<br/>
<br/>
There is also <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://yahooligans.yahoo.com/">http://yahooligans.yahoo.com/</a> which is a<br/>
web guide for kids, and<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ajkids.com/index.asp?origin=0&meta=1">http://www.ajkids.com/index.asp?origin=0&meta=1</a>  which<br/>
is the kid version of &quot;ask jeeves&quot; -- but I sometimes<br/>
think pages like this are harder to get the answers we<br/>
are looking for.<br/>

I find Google is my best friend... you can type in a question and *poof*,  <br/>
usually an answer. I haven&#39;t stumped it yet lol... my son asked why the moon was <br/>
 out in the day once, and, gee, I never thought about it much. So, I learned  <br/>
something too. I just &quot;googled&quot; &quot;moon out during the day&quot; and I had a bunch <br/>
of  results.  <br/>
