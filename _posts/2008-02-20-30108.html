<div id="ygrps-yiv-1879394546">Is there any writing on help for a husband and wife who are just not<br/>
on the same page?  They are unschoolers, but struggle with<br/>

never experienced marriage problems, and well...  they are my in-laws. :-O<br/>

What I do know is the lack of respect in the family is bad.  It&#39;s<br/>
causing a lot of problems and tension, especially with the teenager<br/>
(13).  The dad is under the impression that he gets respect because he<br/>
is &quot;the father&quot;.  Yet, imo, he doesn&#39;t act in a way that will get him<br/>
much respect.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway...  if any has been in this situation, my MIL is looking for<br/>
some help, but doesn&#39;t have internet right now since everytime he gets<br/>
mad he shuts it off.  It should be on soon.  I&#39;d like to be able to<br/>
find someone she could talk to or who has written something on the<br/>
subject.</div>

I think Rue Kream&#39;s book is excellent for <br/>
understanding...ummmm...*understanding*. It&#39;s a *really* easy read in a <br/>
Q&A format.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s definitely radical---but presented in such a peaceful, <br/>
matter-of-fact way, you forget it&#39;s all that radical. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s ALL about respect for the individual.<br/>

This sounds abusive. He turns the internet access off when he&#39;s pissed <br/>
at others???<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing he won&#39;t listen to *anything* though. Or do you think he <br/>
wants to change?<br/>

<br/>
Yep.  He forced a math curriculum on the two older boys because he<br/>
wasn&#39;t &quot;convinced&quot;.  I find him very verbally abusive.  for the first<br/>
time I actually let her in on how I feel about him.  I feel so weird<br/>
about that.  i just felt she needed to hear it.  The problem that I<br/>
see is that husband and wife are not communicating.  At all.  And the<br/>
kids are suffering.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a tough one.  It seems to go back and forth.  What I do know<br/>
is that he will not listen to me or my husband (his oldest son from a<br/>
previous marriage)and we are not terribly comfortable discussing this<br/>
with him (yet).  So I felt that since she came to me, I could try and<br/>
put a few tools into her hands.  :-)  I always see her trying to do<br/>
the right thing, they have been unschooling so much longer, but for<br/>
some reason it just doesn&#39;t go smoothly  their house (unless he isn&#39;t<br/>
there).  I feel like they are so much older, yet so much more immature<br/>
in their dealings with each other!  I would say he is the bigger<br/>
problem, but I&#39;m not sure she is handling it well either.  My son who<br/>
spends some time there, recently told me &quot;they fight all the time&quot;. <br/>
(meaning argue)  Needless to say visits have been shortened.  I don&#39;t<br/>
think my kids need to witness their dirty laundry, KWIM?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1367557639">From personal experience, we got a lot of insight and support through<br/>
seeing a counselor jointly. Most of DH difficulties came from never<br/>
being respected, seeing his mother verbally disrespected and then<br/>
boarding school where kids were treated appallingly.<br/>
<br/>
It might be that your FIL had a similar example growing up? Not as an<br/>
excuse but maybe a starting point to look at where to start growing<br/>
and changing.<br/>
<br/>
Also joint counseling would give a place to talk, away from bickering<br/>
 at home constantly.<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately though he/they need to want a change.  <br/>
