<div id="ygrps-yiv-157906869">This vacation you&#39;re beginning today is about finding your joy again.<br/>
As both of you do the things that bring joy into your home and spirit,<br/>
you will feel the chains of school loosen, the bonds begin to break.<br/>
As you connect as mother and child over your interests, you will see<br/>
how beautiful learning can truly be. As you begin to truly LIVE,<br/>
you&#39;ll wonder at those that stay trapped within the box of school and<br/>
never choose to fly free.<br/>

I just wanted to say that even though I have been unschooling for a <br/>
long time I found this whole post just inspiring and well, <br/>
beautiful.  This paragraph especially describes what finding <br/>
unschooling did for me.  Years ago when I was thinking that a good <br/>
home school mommy recreated school at home, I was growing so <br/>
frustrated and upset because I felt that by being their &#39;teacher&#39;, I <br/>
was missing out on just being their mom.  I wanted to be their mom, <br/>
and unschooling brought all that back.  The difference in the <br/>
atmosphere of our home when we started unschooling was so big you <br/>
could &#39;feel it in the air&#39;.  It made everyone happier, and the joy <br/>
spilled over to others outside our home.  It has been several years <br/>
since we started unschooling but I stay on the &#39;basics&#39; list because <br/>
it helps me to remember...to remember what it was like before... and <br/>
to be ever so thankful.<br/>
