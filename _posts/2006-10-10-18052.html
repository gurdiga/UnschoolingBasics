 </span></blockquote>And if you have a chance to get to DisneyWorld, there is an Indiana<br/>
Jones Stunt Spectacular that shows at MGM Studios.  FUN show and if<br/>
you hang around after the show, some of the cast members come out and<br/>
talk to the kids and show them different stage punches and fighting<br/>
techniques to make it look like you are really hitting someone when<br/>
you aren&#39;t.  It&#39;s fun, funny and you can learn a thing or two (well,<br/>
ok, I threw that in just in case my mom is reading over my shoulder<br/>
LOL!)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a new Indy movie in the works - yes, with Harrison Ford! So <br/>
that&#39;s something to keep an eye out for. In the meantime, <br/>
archaeology, ancient civilizations, antiquities are all part of the <br/>
Indiana Jones movies. Maybe get a big map and push pins and <br/>
different colors of yarn and track each adventure - I know that Last <br/>
Crusade bounces from the US to France to the Middle East and Raiders <br/>
hits Germany and Egypt and other places and Temple of Doom, I <br/>
believe, is somewhere in Asia. It&#39;ll take many close watchings to <br/>
catch the place names and track the storylines.<br/>
<br/>
On another tack, you could check out other Harrison Ford adventures <br/>
(which includes Star Wars episodes 4-6) or Sean Connery movies <br/>
(since he was in Last Crusade as Indy&#39;s father; James Bond <br/>
adventures) or snakes (since Indy hates snakes) or other similar <br/>
adventure movies like Alan Quartermain or Jewel of the Nile or some <br/>
of the old Tarzan type movies &quot;in darkest Africa&quot;. Depends on which <br/>
parts of Indiana Jones he is fascinated by - the travel/places, the <br/>
archaeology, the adventures, etc. Could even do things like treasure <br/>
hunts and geocaching - using clues and puzzles to find things.<br/>

If you can stand the cleavage &lt;g&gt;, the Lara Croft / Tombraider video<br/>
games and movies have a bit of an archealogical theme.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen Young Indiana Jones books, but don&#39;t know exact titles.  If<br/>
you go to Amazon and search the entire site for &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; you<br/>
may find unexpected things.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of years ago Lego had building sets with explorers and<br/>
ancient temples.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a treasure hunting theme, but mostly U.S. settings, in the<br/>
recent Nicholas Cage movie National Treasure.  My 12 year old liked it<br/>
enough to watch it 3 times.<br/>
<br/>
If your kid likes the gross dinner scene in the 2nd movie, then he<br/>
might like Fear Factor re-runs. ;-)<br/>
