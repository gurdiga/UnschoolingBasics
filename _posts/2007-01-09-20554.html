Simply  pulling up my shirt and touching is something they like to do, too. <br/>
And I just  tell them whether it&#39;s okay for me at the moment, or  not.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

I have boys.  My youngest, when he was like 8, right after he  stopped <br/>
nursing, liked to have his hand against my breast to fall asleep.   Now he likes to <br/>
lay his head against my shirt at the side of my breast.  He  says it is soft <br/>
and warm.  It comforts him.  That is fine with  me.  I can see it changing, in <br/>
that he does this less and less.  Soon  it will be not at all.<br/>
