<div id="ygrps-yiv-1925163349">We have put up a picture of the t shirt. I LOVE IT! It is a gorgeous<br/>
terracotta on a sage t shirt. It says Enjoy Life Unschooling and had a<br/>
catchy graphic of a child at play. The sleeve has the conference<br/>
information. They will be amazing. I can&#39;t wait to get one :-)<br/>

<br/>
ALSO registration is still going. Our spaces are limited and we are closing<br/>
in on capacity!!! There are 8 days left for the GENERAL registration after<br/>
that we stop taking T shirt orders and the conference fees go up. Reserve<br/>
your space while we still have some available. And save some money. You can<br/>
order a shirt on its own if you can&#39;t come :-( They are worth wearing around<br/>
town flying your freak flag!<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t wait to meet everyone who is coming. I will be sure to come say HI!<br/>
<br/>
