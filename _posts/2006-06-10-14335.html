<div id="ygrps-yiv-856631657">The posts today have me wondering about what parents need to unschool.<br/>
<br/>
  I think you *really* do have to see learning in everything. There&#39;s no <br/>
&quot;manner of unschooling&quot;---there&#39;s learning and there&#39;s ...not.<br/>
<br/>
  I think many parents think that a child will &quot;get&quot; schoolish subjects <br/>
by doing something that the *parent* could possibly, remotely see as <br/>
academic.<br/>
<br/>
  Reading recipes, IMing (REAL writing for REAL purpose), discussion, <br/>
philosophizing, and laughing are all too far outside school&#39;s grasp. <br/>
Not &quot;academic enough---not academic at all.<br/>
<br/>
  Like building a deck would be an acceptable way to &quot;get&quot; math. <br/>
Or---making a robot could qualify as math. A child needn&#39;t read <br/>
Shakespeare, but he *should* want to read the classics for English. <br/>
Stephen King wouldn&#39;t count---that&#39;s just fluff. And maybe not write a <br/>
report, but at least write poetry or beautiful (and proper!) letters to <br/>
Grandma.<br/>
<br/>
  But that&#39;s NOT what real learning looks like. That&#39;s all school crap. <br/>
Sandra calls it &quot;looking at the world through school-colored glasses.&quot; <br/>
Take the damned glasses OFF!<br/>
<br/>
  The young man who is interested in bombs concerns me. He *could* be a <br/>
borderline personality and be actually dangerous. He could just be <br/>
trying to shock his mom into leaving him alone---or the other <br/>
extreme---shock her into doing *something*---seeing him as real.<br/>
<br/>
  Since she sees him as deficient, I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s the latter. I think <br/>
he&#39;s a smart kid with a mom who doesn&#39;t understand him or learning in <br/>
general.<br/>
<br/>
  You can&#39;t change the child. You *can* change yourself and how you see <br/>
him. See him as perfect and whole and unique and smart and wonderful. <br/>
See him as a learning machine. Change *YOURSELF* and your child will <br/>
blossom.<br/>
<br/>

  &quot;The hardest problem for the brain is not learning, but forgetting. No <br/>
matter how hard we try, we can&#39;t deliberately forget something we have <br/>
learned, and that is catastrophic if we learn that we can&#39;t learn.&quot; <br/>

<br/>
I guess it depends on a lot of other factors. To me, this child sounds<br/>
like a human being that has not had enough control in his life and the<br/>
dangerous stuff makes him feel powerful. Not a great way to gain<br/>
control. Give him real power over his life and he&#39;ll be in a better<br/>
position to see the harm in some of that stuff...hopefully.<br/>
<br/>
Trevor is fascinated with weaponry, how to make bombs etc... He&#39;s also<br/>
a peace-loving individual with NO hint of a desire to actually harm<br/>
anything or try dangerous illegal activities. He&#39;s a hugely sweet guy<br/>
that would give a friend the shirt off his back if he thought they<br/>
needed it.<br/>
<br/>
He also feels in control of his life and knows he has the power to<br/>
make any changes and be supported completely. Big difference.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-482397483">Well, my first day on this list and I might be blackballed after this, LOL,<br/>
but I just had to speak up.  The 12 year old who is interested in bombs,<br/>
poisons, and drugs - yes, it could totally be a phase or attention-getting<br/>
tactic.  But I would be interested to know how long he has been interested<br/>
in/pursuing these topics?  If it just started, that is one thing - I would<br/>
keep a loose eye on it.  It could be a passing interest.  Maybe one day he<br/>
will be an expert at defusing bombs - you never know.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
But, if it is something that has been an interest for awhile, I agree with<br/>
the person that said it could also be dangerous.  Hopefully not, but those<br/>
of you responding know nothing about this boy.  Neither do I.  But there<br/>
have been too many tragedies with kids in this country to not also take it<br/>
seriously.  If it is a concern for you Erin, I would ask the opinions of<br/>
those who you trust and also know your son well to see what they think.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
And, again, I am not trying to be an alarmist - not at all.  I just think<br/>
you do need to take into consideration that it could also be him sending<br/>
signals that he might need help - in whatever form or fashion.  Just a<br/>
different point of view..<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Well, if I&#39;m blackballed, it was fun while it lasted..<br/>

outward - most kids turn it inward into some kind of self-loathing or  <br/>
even self-harm, such as cutting or starving themselves.<br/>

He&#39;s young, too, and so I, personally, would worry about where this  <br/>
would lead if nothing is done to empower him in other ways.<br/>
<br/>
A fascination with explosives isn&#39;t unusual - lots of my teens&#39;  <br/>
friends are VERY into explosives - in movies and in their &quot;play.&quot; But  <br/>
this interest along WITH the rest of the information and the way the  <br/>
mom speaks about it - that definitely seems worrisome.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; borderline personality and be actually dangerous.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This reminds me of something a couple of years ago on an unschooling <br/>
list.  A mom said that her son wanted to go into the military, and <br/>
another mom on the list was just horrified.  She said something to <br/>
the effect that all soldiers were basically dysfunctional people.  <br/>
Several people responded to tell her that this was just untrue.  <br/>
<br/>
Lots of people find bombs to be interesting.  I&#39;ve always been <br/>
fascinated by fire, and I used to enjoy chemistry experiments where <br/>
I got to burn stuff - LOL.  My dh is in the Air Force and is very <br/>
knowledgeable about weapons.  He likes to play shooter games on the <br/>
computer or be an assassin in games & stuff like that.  He&#39;s not a <br/>
violent person at all.  <br/>
<br/>
Please don&#39;t assume that just because someone is interested in <br/>
something that can be dangerous, the person is dangerous.  <br/>

This sounds so much like my husband who is in the Army.  He also happens to be a demolitions expert (he&#39;s a Combat Engineer).  Right now he is teaching Iraqi soldiers how to detect and defuse IEDs (improvised explosive devices).  He&#39;s probably the most levelheaded and sincere person I&#39;ve ever met.  He&#39;s also not violent at all.  But, boy, does he love his demolitions!  He&#39;s like a really big kid when he starts talking about his job...he gets that twinkle in his eye, and his face just lights up.  The sign of someone who is passionate about his job.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1894347014">Just chiming in on this topic of bombs and weapons interest in <br/>
relationship to a young man.  Our first five were girls...the last <br/>
two boys.  What a WORLD of difference.  They truely are from <br/>
Mars!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Our oldest boy, Andrew, is 14, and he has wanted to go into the <br/>
military ever since he was five-years-old.  He loves everything guns <br/>
and knives.  He loves to explore martial arts.  He thinks the idea <br/>
of killing a squirrel or a bird is a-okay, and in the right instance <br/>
maybe even funny.  Andrew is also a natural shot and great hunter.  <br/>
He views violence in war as necessary and acceptable.  On the flip <br/>
side he is excellent with young children, extremely helpful, <br/>
compassionate, a good writer and a wonderful artist who wouldn&#39;t <br/>
hurt anyone.<br/>
<br/>
Our youngest boy, Adrian, is 12, and he loves &quot;violent&quot; video games, <br/>
b.b. guns, South Park, Joe Cartoon and looks forward to joining Pat <br/>
and Andrew for his first hunt this fall even though he&#39;s a <br/>
vegetarian.  On the flip side he is thoughtful, knowledgable about <br/>
small animals and history, has extreme polital views and interests <br/>
and is also good with young children.  He would never hurt anyone <br/>
and thinks senseless killing is, well, senseless.<br/>
<br/>
I think that our boys can come as a shock to us moms at times.  <br/>
There were times that Adrian&#39;s &quot;dark side&quot; made me raise an eyebrow <br/>
here and there, but I just paid close attention to him.  I listened <br/>
more and got as in tune with him as I possibly could.  From my <br/>
experience it seems that boys, maybe not all of them...but at least <br/>
some of them, go through a real &quot;snakes and snails&quot; phase.  They are <br/>
SO different than girls, and I&#39;m a girl.  So, I don&#39;t get A LOT <br/>
about them.  When it comes to this I am VERY grateful that my <br/>
husband is around.  I also try to read about boys specifically.  It <br/>
really does help.<br/>
<br/>
I also try to be VERY, VERY open to them.  They talk about <br/>
disgusting stuff that involves bodily fluids, bodily sounds and <br/>
natural urges.  They talk about killing and hurting and like <br/>
aggressive things.  That&#39;s not my bag, but I do talk and laugh with <br/>
them.  If something REALLY grosses me out, or I just can&#39;t handle <br/>
the way they are talking, I will comment something to the tune <br/>
of, &quot;Okay, ladies are present.&quot; or, &quot;Mom&#39;s REALLY don&#39;t NEED to know <br/>
that!&quot;  This is always with a smile, and they tend to laugh, but <br/>
they do back it off a bit to respect my poor, little brain.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll ever &quot;get&quot; boys, but I do know we have <br/>
excellent relationships with eachother.  It didn&#39;t start this way, <br/>
but it became open and wonderful by one means.  Someone else <br/>
mentioned it earlier, *I* changed, not them.  It is SO true that <br/>
your behavior will change your children.  Openness is ESSENTIAL for <br/>
a mom to have a successful relationship with her son...not that it <br/>
isn&#39;t essential for other things too, we just happen to be talking <br/>
about boys right now.<br/>
<br/>
Just my two-cents worth...<br/>

the original post to these bomb responses.<br/>
<br/>
I remember when I was about 13 years old and was obsessed with being a <br/>
grifter, learning to pick locks, pick pockets, etc. I never would have <br/>
carried it out because I didn&#39;t necessarily have the need or desire to do it <br/>
in real life - I just wanted to know HOW to do it. Kind of like wanting to <br/>
be able to do a magic trick every once in a while. I wanted to know how to <br/>
have the sleight of hand to accomplish all of these (the way I saw it) <br/>
&quot;cool&quot; tricks. Sure, they were crimes in reality, but in the movies they <br/>
looked so cool and I wanted to be crafty (not in the knitting way that I&#39;m <br/>
crafty these days :)<br/>
<br/>
Not really an answer, and, yes, I&#39;m sure there are concerns in some <br/>
situations and with some kids. Just putting another perspective out there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-947426012">I know a lot of people who sell stuff on e-bay and make a lot of money.  All <br/>
you need is a computer and a digital camera.  You can start by selling stuff <br/>
you have around that you no longer need or buy stuff at yard sales or thrift <br/>
stores.  I&#39;ve done it a couple of times.  I sold a baby backpack I picked up at <br/>
the dump for 80.00 + shipping.  All profit.  I sold a pet carrier that our <br/>
free bunnies were delivered in for 45.00 + shipping.  It&#39;s easy and your children <br/>
can do most of it.  Packing and shipping, taking pictures, responding to <br/>
questions about the items, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Once you get going, invest some of your profits in electronics.  Look for <br/>
closeouts and discontinued models.  My neighbor sold a cd player for twice more <br/>
than she paid.  <br/>

I have had good luck making things and selling them at fairs,homeschool  conferences, etc. But that is if you have an idea of what to make. I started my business very small with no money at all, sold at farmer&#39;s markets, etc. and the kids have been involved in every aspect of it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2026204705">I don&#39;t know how unschooly this would be, but my aunt lives next door to a  <br/>
large family of homeschoolers.  They have a sort of catering  business.  They <br/>
have a menu of cookies, cakes, pies, sandwiches and soups,  simple to make <br/>
items.  They put up fliers all over the neighborhood and  church and friends&#39; <br/>
businesses.  They will make simple lunches for casual  business meetings, provide <br/>
cookies and cakes for parties or for a busy mom when  she needs cupcakes for <br/>
school!  I think they require a certain amount of  notice.<br/>
 <br/>
My aunt says they are quite busy because people like the idea of supporting  <br/>
this family.  Plus the food is homemade!<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m not sure how much of a money maker it would be.  But I think it is  a <br/>
good place to start to brainstorm!  What simple services do people need  when <br/>
most people are at work or school?<br/>
 <br/>
To me the tricky part might be translating this sort of &quot;on demand&quot;  business <br/>
into an unschooling environment.  <br/>

your state and county (and city) ordinances with such an endeavor.  In<br/>
some areas home based cooking businesses have to have inspecitions<br/>
just like restaurants have.<br/>

peaceful just looking at your website and imagining those lovely silk  <br/>
items flowing through my fingers! I want the Rainbow Blanket for  <br/>
myself - it is going on my list of things the kids could get me for a  <br/>
birthday gift!!<br/>
<br/>
How great to make a business out of providing something so lovely and  <br/>
wonderful for children to play with and enjoy!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1048017614">We&#39;ve recently had success with Craig&#39;s list selling a frig that we <br/>
only used for about 3 or 4 years and a bike rack that was also only <br/>
used a handful of times.   I&#39;m searching for more items that we might <br/>
have better luck selling this way as opposed to a yard or tag sale.<br/>
