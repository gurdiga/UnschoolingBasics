<div id="ygrps-yiv-1067382918">I am reaching for any advice I can get!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to the list, my name is Julie Humphrey, we<br/>
live in Dallas Texas.<br/>
<br/>
Our youngest son is the last one still at home.  He<br/>
was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in May last year. <br/>
Life has been hectic to say the least ever since.<br/>
<br/>
I have been homeschooling for 11 years.<br/>
<br/>
Stuart&#39;s been doing a more &quot;paperwork&quot; oriented,<br/>
relaxed but still a lot of structure and paperwork.<br/>
<br/>
I have found that when his blood sugars are unstable<br/>
(very typical for type 1 diabetes children) he has<br/>
trouble focusing and becomes very irratable I&#39;m sure<br/>
because he doesn&#39;t feel well.<br/>
<br/>
I feel like it&#39;s all been a fight all year.  My gut<br/>
tells me we need a change.<br/>
<br/>
I am wanting to know more about unschooling...how to<br/>
do it...what IS it???  <br/>
<br/>
I have read a lot, I like Sandra Dodd&#39;s philosophy<br/>
(hey, the kid already plays xbox till the cows come<br/>
home!) <br/>
<br/>
I want Stuart to Enjoy His Life.  He goes thru SO much<br/>
every day...so much structure with his diet, shots,<br/>
blood gluecose testing...etc...I&#39;m thinking having<br/>
such a structured education is just adding to his<br/>
frustration.<br/>
<br/>
I need help, advice, words of wisdom...anything!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks So Much!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2039338982">Remember that there is a difference between &quot;school&quot; and &quot;learning.&quot;<br/>
Unschooling will avoid the schooly things while focusing on the learning.<br/>
Unschooling is &quot;child-led&quot; &quot;lifestyle of learning&quot; &quot;interest driven&quot;<br/>
&quot;natural learning.&quot;  It is allowing the child to learn about the things he<br/>
wants to learn about when he wants to learn about them and in the way he<br/>
wants to learn them.  It&#39;s letting the child&#39;s interests determine your<br/>
course of study and the scope and sequence.  Unschooling is NOT avoiding<br/>
books or structure, some children demand structure.  If a child wants to use<br/>
workbooks, letting them is Unschooling.  It&#39;s letting the child have<br/>
autonomy over his own education.  If you are a Christian, you may think of<br/>
Unschooling as &quot;spirit-led-learning.&quot;<br/>

Julie, the best I can tell you is to keep reading here. You can also stop by <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:unschoolingdiscussion@yahoogroups.com">unschoolingdiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> and at www.unschooling.info and www.unschooling.com<br/>
<br/>
The ShinewithUnschooling yahoogroup might also be helpful, as the moms are dealing with issues outside unschooling. Unschooling just makes it easier. They&#39;re a wealth of info!<br/>
<br/>
There are some wonderful books on the market: The Unprocessed Child is the latest. Valerie Fitzenreiter is the author. Another is coming out this summer (more info on that one as it becomes available! &lt;g&gt;) which will knock your socks off!<br/>
<br/>
Read all John Holt&#39;s books. The Book of Learning and Forgetting by Frank Smith. Anything by Alfie Kohn, John Taylor Gatto, and Howard Gardner.<br/>
<br/>
Mostly, just enjoy your son. Allow him the time and space to disengage himself from the school mind-set. Let him get used to his new life---that&#39;s stressful enough! And if you think he&#39;s not learning anything---think again! He&#39;ll learn more about his body, his health, diabetes, exercise, etc. than most adults know after years and years on this planet!<br/>
<br/>
Allow him time to rest and heal. The learning will come as he starts to feel better.<br/>

I&#39;m new here too and this isn&#39;t my first language but I have to say,  keep <br/>
here. These wonderful women can help you and I have to say you like  Kelly said: <br/>
enjoy your son and also keep a journal of all the things you  are doing, <br/>
everything can be important to record. Jot it down all that your son  expresses,  <br/>
and talk, talk to him, play with him, that he feel you are his  best friend. <br/>
Look at his eyes and really enjoy to talk to him. Like vacations,  yeah!!,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1640489216">&quot;Is she just<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; overwhelmed with choices? Should I sign her up for a class despite<br/>
&gt; her protests?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with others that your options weren&#39;t great options really. I<br/>
would be looking at all the fun things you enjoy as a family...renting<br/>
movies, playing games, inviting friends over for pizza, going on<br/>
hikes, visiting amusement parks, all the things that bring joy right<br/>
now. You&#39;re looking at organized group and classes as your options,<br/>
those aren&#39;t really great options and she&#39;s letting you know that.<br/>
<br/>
Part of the picture, is she&#39;s still getting back in touch with herself<br/>
and her passions. That takes some time and some &quot;not knowing&quot; what you<br/>
really want. Fill her life with REAL opportunities. Not preplanned<br/>
without her knowledge, but options. What are the other family members<br/>
doing? Are you all waiting on her to come up with something or accept<br/>
something?  How are the rest of you following your passions?<br/>
<br/>
You can plan stuff YOU enjoy and invite her along with the option to<br/>
stay home with a good movie or a friend if she doesn&#39;t want to join you.<br/>
It sounds like there is a lot of focus on how to GET her to do<br/>
something. She might be feeling a bit of pressure and at the same time<br/>
feel &quot;stuck&quot; and unsure of what she wants. Does she love video games<br/>
or photography or nature? What makes her get excited? Is it friends or<br/>
clothes or makeup? Ask yourself how to feed the things she already<br/>
loves and dive in! She has things that get her excited, I can just<br/>
about guarantee it. But maybe those things are being undervalued for<br/>
activities that the adults deem more important? Only you know the<br/>
answers, but it&#39;s good stuff to think about.<br/>
<br/>
None of the options you listed would appeal to my teens, yet they are<br/>
active, happy, interesting people that enjoy their lives. They just<br/>
aren&#39;t much for clubs and classes right now (other than the informal<br/>
Dungeons and Dragons group we just started meeting with....which is<br/>
simply some friends that get together and share a common interest).<br/>
