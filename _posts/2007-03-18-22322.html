<div id="ygrps-yiv-910045170">I am new to the group and unsure that I want to completely convert to <br/>
the unschooling ways but here is what I am asking for.  My kids are <br/>
ages 13, 10, and 7.  They love hands on projects but I am a &quot;project&quot; <br/>
of the public school and am at a loss for ideas.  I feel if we are not <br/>
sitting with noses in books we aren&#39;t learning but I know that I also <br/>
learned better with hands on projects I just don&#39;t know how to <br/>
approach it or where to go.  I need help finding sources of ideas for <br/>
Science and Social Studies and even math or any other things that I <br/>
can help them to learn with, without being stuck in a book.  If you <br/>
have any ideas I would really appreciate the help.<br/>

You might want to get &quot;unstuck&quot; from the mindset that you need to<br/>
cover topics before you even think about projects. The first step<br/>
towards unschooling, is to see life as the best way to learn. Life<br/>
involves play and exploration and ideas and discovery, but there&#39;s no<br/>
need for a schoolish mindset to affect how you approach those things.<br/>
<br/>
So....first step; quit trying to cover subjects. Second step; start<br/>
playing and focusing on the things that bring you joy. Third step;<br/>
declare each day a vacation....you&#39;ll be well on your way to<br/>
unschooling at that point!:)<br/>

<br/>
   They love hands on projects but I am a &quot;project&quot;<br/>
of the public school and am at a loss for ideas.  I feel if we are not<br/>
sitting with noses in books we aren&#39;t learning but I know that I also<br/>

have any ideas I would really appreciate the help.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
As much as I love them, books are over-rated. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Life and learning shouldn&#39;t be divided into subjects---they&#39;re all <br/>
connected and interconnected. Math IS science IS social studies IS art <br/>
is history IS music IS literature. If you can see how things are <br/>
connected and how they intertwine and inspire and filter through each <br/>
other, your learning will be more organic and meaningful.<br/>
<br/>
Science and social studies can&#39;t be separated: bubonic plague? atomic <br/>
bombs? penicillin? influenza of 1918? Advances in science transform our <br/>
society! Lasagne? Sushi? Sauerbraten? Tortillas?  The science of food <br/>
and eating can define societies! Math is found in ALL those things! As <br/>
are history, music, art, literature, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Pick a subject, any subject (I don&#39;t mean *school* subjects!)---like <br/>
fashion. Or WWII. Furniture design or gardening. Drumming or clocks. <br/>
Delve INTO that subject/passion. You WILL hit on math and science and <br/>
social studies and art and music and history and literature. GUARANTEED!<br/>
<br/>
BUT---to answer your question: try the SCA (Society for Creative <br/>
Anachronism) as a place to start with hands-on learning. Most areas of <br/>
the country have *some* kind of living history museum or reinactments <br/>
(around here, in SC, we have both the Civil War and Revolutionary War <br/>
reinactors---and just last year a group set up a Roman camp). Go. Be. <br/>
Share. Ask questions. Maybe get involved next time!<br/>
<br/>
For &quot;science&quot; try the local glass-blowers (don&#39;t forget to notice all <br/>
the *ART* around you while on that science trip &lt;G&gt;) or blacksmith or <br/>
bakery. &quot;Social studies&quot;---go sit at the mall or on a bench downtown. <br/>
Watch the people. If you want, you can make a checklist: how many/how <br/>
many together/how many red shoes/hairstyles/cell phones/ ...WHY?<br/>
<br/>
History: Netflix all the war movies ever made. Compare all the takes on <br/>
war and intrigue. Look at how CLEAN war was in the early movies---like <br/>
ONE spot of blood on a sparkly uniform. THEN watch one of these recent <br/>
movies: BraveHeart, Saving Private Ryan, The Patriot, Gladiator---blood <br/>
and guts and gore and veins between your teeth! Why?<br/>
<br/>
Get a big map of the US. Another of the world. Check off where you&#39;ve <br/>
been. Where you *want* to go. Watch how that changes.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m giving these examples NOT for your children!!! YOU go do them! SEE <br/>
how much you&#39;re learning. Then accept that they will too.<br/>
<br/>
Learning is everywhere, but most people have been brainwashed into <br/>
thinking that learning only happens with books and in a classroom. We <br/>
didn&#39;t have either until pretty recently in history---how did we EVER <br/>
move out of caves???<br/>

the best ideas here have come from my kids.  ask them what they want to <br/>
do...what they are interested in doing.  if they could do anything what <br/>
would it be?<br/>
<br/>
if i&#39;ve bumped into something going on that i think might be interesting i <br/>
ask them if they want to do it before signing them up for any program <br/>
offered by local community/or homeschooling community.  It doesn&#39;t seem to <br/>
matter if i think it&#39;s a great idea of they are not interested.<br/>
<br/>
given the opportunity kids can create all sorts of activites, programs, <br/>
projects and crafts from their passions....<br/>

****************<br/>
But on an unschooling list, you are going to get unschooling ideas. &quot;Projects&quot; develop, naturally, from all those unschooling ideas that were given. They are not laid out with a plan in mind, steps drawn up and neatly ordered.<br/>
Learning IS fun, when it is not &quot;Learning&quot;. *learning* about rocks is the exact same thing as picking them up, looking at the little spots of color, hefting their weight, eyeing the stream, throwing it as hard as you can to make as big a splash as you can. *learning* is realizing that big rocks make BIG splashes, especially if you can toss them from the bridge over the creek.<br/>
No one needs to make that fun, it just is.<br/>
****<br/>
If anyone has had projects or crafts that they<br/>
have done that have worked**<br/>
By worked you mean like a catpult that heaves rocks? or a light switch that turns lights on or off? <br/>
I&#39;m being facetious here. <br/>
I think you may be meaning - projects or crafts that made boring stuff fun.<br/>
No. I&#39;m not trying to get my kids to &quot;Learn&quot; what I think they should be learning. I&#39;m busily rushing behind them to try to keep up with all the wonderful exciting things they are interested in. Pokemon strategies and characters, bearded dragons, paper dolls, amuse bouches, indie rock chicks, Naruto maps, environmental issues, mountaintop removal, tampaction, chef&#39;s knives, fossils, birding, raised beds, acrylic painting, and so on and so on and so on.<br/>

understanding from everyone but you.  I said that I am<br/>
just not prepared to make that leap yet and unsure if<br/>
I will or not but if I don&#39;t get help and<br/>
understanding from those that are doing it how will I<br/>
know more about it.  I think the first step to<br/>
unschooling starts with getting out of the mind set<br/>
that learning HAS to be from a book and that is what I<br/>
am trying to do.  I am doing what I think is best for<br/>
my children, I am changing my ways of thinking JUST by<br/>
being on this list.  Maybe I am not expressing myself<br/>
very well.  I am trying to open my way of thinking and<br/>
not subject my children to the &quot;closed minded&quot;, &quot;only<br/>
one right way to do it&quot; thinking that I went through<br/>
and my kids have been subjected to when they were in<br/>
public school.  <br/>
<br/>
My oldest is very interested in Dungeons and<br/>
dragons...he does spend many hours just planning out<br/>
dungeons and campains, my daughter spends lots of time<br/>
playing with barbies and drawing, and my youngest just<br/>
likes to have books read to him.  My oldest asked if I<br/>
could help him with learning about civil war weapons<br/>
and uniforms and such and I can but the way I learned<br/>
about it was through a boring book and I don&#39;t want to<br/>
do that to him.  I also go through days that I feel<br/>
like they are not learning if they are not behind a<br/>
book but instead of throwing a book at them I am<br/>
trying to encourage them with some experiments and<br/>
cool projects.  <br/>
<br/>
So correct me if I am wrong, is the group for families<br/>
that are learning about unschooling or not.  If not, I<br/>
will GLADLY leave and you will never hear from me<br/>
again.  Thanks for your time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-802336814">Hi Twila,<br/>
<br/>
I know exactly what you are going through.  My kids<br/>
were also in public school until the end of their 3rd<br/>
and 4th grade years.  It is hard to break away from<br/>
the schooly things/terms.  I am still getting used to<br/>
unschooling, and it is hard. It gets hard when you are<br/>
used to doing things one way.<br/>
<br/>
How about since your son is into the dungeons and<br/>
dragons stuff, maybe you could rent some movies or<br/>
something that has dragons in it.<br/>
<br/>
We really don&#39;t do much around my house.  Alot of<br/>
times, the kids play video games, or we play board<br/>
games, or watch movies.  They do help me when we<br/>
grocery shop, by adding how much we spend, so that I<br/>
don&#39;t forget where we are at, especially since money<br/>
is tight.<br/>
<br/>
There is a Sandra Dodd website that has a lot of good<br/>
information.  There are tons of things to do, it&#39;s<br/>
just what you are all interested in.  Last fall, we<br/>
dug up some hostas, because I was tired of them, and<br/>
they were choking out my other flowers.  We all<br/>
learned that we aren&#39;t planting any hostas, they are<br/>
to hard to dig up.  We also went to the Air Zoo, which<br/>
the kids hated.  <br/>
<br/>
I think one of the first things we did, and are kind<br/>
of still doing is to deschool.  From what I&#39;ve heard,<br/>
it&#39;s one month per year your child was in school. <br/>
After that, just do what you guys are interested in. <br/>
I have noticed that my kids are much happier, and more<br/>
relaxed than they were when they were in public<br/>
school.  Feel free to email me off list if you want to<br/>
talk/ bounce ideas off me.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you find what you are looking for.  Most of the<br/>
people on this list are really helpful.  I started out<br/>
on another website, besides this one, trying to find<br/>
out what unschooling was, and what a typical day was<br/>
like.  I can tell you that there aren&#39;t any typical<br/>
days, everyone&#39;s day looks different.  Just when you<br/>
think that the kids aren&#39;t learning anything, they<br/>
surprise you.<br/>
<br/>
Take care and good luck.<br/>

&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Well, honestly I have gotten a lot of help and<br/>
&gt; understanding from everyone but you.  I said that I<br/>
&gt; am<br/>
&gt; just not prepared to make that leap yet and unsure<br/>
&gt; if<br/>
&gt; I will or not but if I don&#39;t get help and<br/>
&gt; understanding from those that are doing it how will<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; know more about it.  I think the first step to<br/>
&gt; unschooling starts with getting out of the mind set<br/>
&gt; that learning HAS to be from a book and that is what<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; am trying to do.  I am doing what I think is best<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; my children, I am changing my ways of thinking JUST<br/>
&gt; by<br/>
&gt; being on this list.  Maybe I am not expressing<br/>
&gt; myself<br/>
&gt; very well.  I am trying to open my way of thinking<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; not subject my children to the &quot;closed minded&quot;,<br/>
&gt; &quot;only<br/>
&gt; one right way to do it&quot; thinking that I went through<br/>
&gt; and my kids have been subjected to when they were in<br/>
&gt; public school.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My oldest is very interested in Dungeons and<br/>
&gt; dragons...he does spend many hours just planning out<br/>
&gt; dungeons and campains, my daughter spends lots of<br/>
&gt; time<br/>
&gt; playing with barbies and drawing, and my youngest<br/>
&gt; just<br/>
&gt; likes to have books read to him.  My oldest asked if<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; could help him with learning about civil war weapons<br/>
&gt; and uniforms and such and I can but the way I<br/>
&gt; learned<br/>
&gt; about it was through a boring book and I don&#39;t want<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; do that to him.  I also go through days that I feel<br/>
&gt; like they are not learning if they are not behind a<br/>
&gt; book but instead of throwing a book at them I am<br/>
&gt; trying to encourage them with some experiments and<br/>
&gt; cool projects.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So correct me if I am wrong, is the group for<br/>
&gt; families<br/>
&gt; that are learning about unschooling or not.  If not,<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; will GLADLY leave and you will never hear from me<br/>

<br/>
Nobody is asking you to leave. I&#39;m explaining what kind of advice is<br/>
given here....unschooling advice. If someone wants help teaching their<br/>
kids or making forced learning fun, that&#39;s not true to the intent of<br/>
this list, nor is it fair to ask anyone to change the purpose of the list.<br/>
<br/>
If you want fun ideas related to topics your children are interested<br/>
in, we can always offer up ideas. They aren&#39;t going to look very<br/>
schoolish though.<br/>
<br/>
This group is for anyone that wants to join. We don&#39;t control the<br/>
membership on any level, but we did decide what kind of list we wanted<br/>
and what kind of information would be shared here when we created it. <br/>
<br/>
If someone joins a vegetarian list and wants information on how to<br/>
cook steak, they might hear about why that won&#39;t work on that<br/>
particular list.;)<br/>
<br/>
Nobody here decides who is unschooling or not, nobody wants to force<br/>
anyone to unschool or tell anyone what to do. But if you come here<br/>
asking for advice, we&#39;re going to give you advice about how to get<br/>
closer to unschooling.<br/>

youngest is 7 yob.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He just loves any books and all books.  Always has<br/>
loved to be read to.  He wants to be a fireman when he<br/>
grows up.  He likes puzzles, loves watching t.v.,<br/>
likes board games, and snuggling...lol<br/>
<br/>
My oldest is mostly interested in Dungeons and<br/>
Dungeons but he also likes playing Xbox, computer<br/>
games, chatting with friends on Yahoo IM, Yu-Gi-Oh,<br/>
weapons, TV, and wants to be a game system game<br/>
designer or computer game designer.<br/>
<br/>
My Daughter likes barbies, drawing, watching t.v.,<br/>
playing softball, and is TOTALLY wrapped up in horses<br/>
(anything to do with horses)  She wants to be a horse<br/>
trainer when she grows up and has since she could<br/>
talk.  We would go to the library and all she would<br/>
want to look at is book about horses and is still like<br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
I struggle all the time with being taught that<br/>
learning had to be from a book, learning has to be<br/>
&quot;boring&quot;, learning has to be taught.  I know that<br/>
isn&#39;t right because I watched them learn when they<br/>
were small by just playing with the blocks or rolling<br/>
the ball but still it is hard to drop that.  &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Anyway thanks for the help<br/>

been seeing lots of birds that they don&#39;t know what<br/>
they are and wanted to know and of course I don&#39;t have<br/>

part is being aware when you find yourself falling into the trap of this <br/>
kind of thinking - staying conscious of how you are with your kids.  the <br/>
more you are trully in the moment with your child, the more you focus on <br/>
what they are doing rather than what they are not doing, the more you stop <br/>
yourself from comparing but switch to appreciating - the more this kind of <br/>
thinking will leave your consciousness.  We are human and may find ourselves <br/>
falling into old stinking thinking that gets in the way of really serving <br/>
our children&#39;s best interest but that&#39;s when we need to laugh at ourselves, <br/>
apologize to our kids (if need be) and move on.  If you are commited to <br/>
unschooling you will get better at stearing away from it with time and <br/>
practice.  Confidence comes with experience.  Your child is just <br/>
fine/perfect the way they are in any given moment.<br/>

youngest is 7 yob.<br/>
<br/>
He just loves any books and all books. Always has<br/>

likes board games, and snuggling...lol<br/>
<br/>
My oldest is mostly interested in Dungeons and<br/>
Dungeons but he also likes playing Xbox, computer<br/>
games, chatting with friends on Yahoo IM, Yu-Gi-Oh,<br/>
weapons, TV, and wants to be a game system game<br/>
designer or computer game designer.<br/>
<br/>
My Daughter likes barbies, drawing, watching t.v.,<br/>
playing softball, and is TOTALLY wrapped up in horses<br/>
(anything to do with horses) She wants to be a horse<br/>
trainer when she grows up and has since she could<br/>
talk. We would go to the library and all she would<br/>
want to look at is book about horses and is still like<br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
I struggle all the time with being taught that<br/>
learning had to be from a book, learning has to be<br/>
&quot;boring&quot;, learning has to be taught. I know that<br/>
isn&#39;t right because I watched them learn when they<br/>
were small by just playing with the blocks or rolling<br/>
the ball but still it is hard to drop that. &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>

(I don&#39;t mean if people are grilling them on facts in a schoolish way, but just regular conversation and play.)  The answer to these questions is almost certainly yes because children (and adults too, hopefully:-) do grow and learn, they can&#39;t help it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You look for greater mastery at what they&#39;re doing rather than  <br/>
specific (school) skills or knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
How did you know they were progressing learning to speak English? Did  <br/>
you check whether they had mastered skills from a checklist? Or did  <br/>
you observe that &quot;Hey, last month he couldn&#39;t say &quot;milk&quot; and this  <br/>
month he can.&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
If you think of learning as pulling the kids to a particular  <br/>
destination, then it&#39;s important that they show they&#39;re progressing  <br/>
towards that goal. It&#39;s cause for worry if you can&#39;t see where they  <br/>
are along the path.<br/>
<br/>
If, instead, you think of learning as them reaching out and pulling  <br/>
towards them whatever interests them (which can be cartoons, games,  <br/>
mudpuddles, Harry Potter, banging on the piano, Shakespeare ...),  <br/>
then your role is to help them reach it and make sure they have lots  <br/>
of stuff (not limited to physical stuff but ideas (like  <br/>
conversations), opportunities (like tv shows! and library trips and  <br/>
musuems) and so on) in their lives they could reach out for when  <br/>
they&#39;re in need of new interests, then unschooling is a whole lot  <br/>
easier.<br/>
<br/>
No, from a school point of view, it doesn&#39;t seem like enough to let  <br/>
them play. But play *is* how kids are created to learn. It&#39;s why  <br/>
putting a textbook in front of them is so hard for them. It&#39;s not  <br/>
that learning is hard. It&#39;s that learning in ways that&#39;s unnatural to  <br/>
them is hard.<br/>
<br/>
We are hardwired to pull sense out of the world, not memorize someone  <br/>
else&#39;s sense. It&#39;s how we pull an understanding of our native  <br/>
language out of the chaos of words flowing around us as toddlers. We  <br/>
dismiss that ability as something that just happens. But think of the  <br/>
power of pulling that kind of order out of that kind of chaos by a  <br/>
child that schools would turn their noses up as not being ready to  <br/>
learn.<br/>
<br/>
Says a lot about schools.<br/>
<br/>
Says way more about the power of natural learning. If a child can  <br/>
pull English out of the atmosphere, a child can pull sense out of the  <br/>
world of cartoons and games and literature and conversations and pets  <br/>
and grocery shopping ... If they have a desire for rocket science in  <br/>
them, they&#39;ll be pulling it out of Road Runner cartoons and asking  <br/>
for more :-)<br/>
<br/>
Children pull out and build a sense of the world from what interests  <br/>
them. They make guesses at how the world (including English) works,  <br/>
try them out and then refine their world picture based on the  <br/>
outcome. It&#39;s how they learn English. It&#39;s how they learn anything.  <br/>
Until adults interfere.<br/>

While you&#39;re trying to figure this all out, declare a holiday and <br/>
see what your kids choose to do on their own. Seriously. They aren&#39;t <br/>

That may be a really valuble way for you to start re-thinking what <br/>
constitutes &quot;learning&quot;. Your kids sound like they are doing a whole <br/>
lot of really fabulous learning on their own, to me.<br/>
<br/>
Another thought is to look at different personality types - our <br/>
personalities effect the ways we learn things, so if the &quot;mulitple <br/>
intelligences&quot; don&#39;t seem to answer you questions, thinking in terms <br/>
of personality as an aspect of learning may be helpful to you. Here <br/>
are a couple different ways to look at personality:<br/>

While you&#39;re trying to figure this all out, declare a holiday and <br/>
see what your kids choose to do on their own. Seriously. They aren&#39;t <br/>
going to learn anything as well as they could, as joyfully as they <br/>
could, with you breathing fire down their necks ;) Tell them that <br/>
*you* need to do some learning of your own. <br/>

<br/>
Living *today* prepares them for tomorrow. Living tomorrow prepares  <br/>
them for the next day. One day at a time.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than worrying about what they might need, fill their days with  <br/>
things they enjoy or might enjoy right now. A rich environment  <br/>
*today* will be a wealth to draw on when tomorrow comes.<br/>
