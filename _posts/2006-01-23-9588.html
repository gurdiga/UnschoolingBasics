<div id="ygrps-yiv-421649790">I didn&#39;t realize how much I&#39;ve internalized unschooling until someone  <br/>
made a comment about Love and Logic. At first I was like &quot;what?!&quot;  <br/>
I&#39;ve loved love and logic, it was our first step towards respecting  <br/>
children, letting them own their problems, stepping back but being  <br/>
available to listen, etc.<br/>
But when i started to think about it, i could see where some of it  <br/>
would be not *living* unschooling. This weekend we went to my cousins  <br/>
house and I just could not stand it! There were my six mobile kids (I  <br/>
don&#39;t think Avari counts much for this), as well as one cousins  <br/>
child, two children from another cousin, a pair of siblings, another  <br/>
pair of siblings, and some neighborhood kids. There were so many  <br/>
things that I couldn&#39;t even mention here.<br/>
I am excited to see it, I don&#39;t even think I could explain what I&#39;m  <br/>
thinking, but wanted to share that I think I&#39;ve seen the light. We&#39;ve  <br/>
been living unschooly for a few months, but it&#39;s starting to take  <br/>
hold and become instinctive. KWIM?<br/>
