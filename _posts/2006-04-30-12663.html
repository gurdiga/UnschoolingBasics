<div id="ygrps-yiv-2136725627">I think what I don&#39;t like about a &quot;support&quot; group  in same cases, is<br/>
that you&#39;re going to get pats on the back no matter what. It&#39;s all<br/>
about support, and not about growth and moving forward.<br/>
<br/>
I think this list IS a great support group if you don&#39;t mind being<br/>
questioned or challenged here and there. It is geared for<br/>
discussion/advice, but many of us find a supportive environment as a<br/>
side benefit of talking to people over the years.<br/>
<br/>
I think any fears or doubts would be met here with encouragment.:)<br/>
It&#39;s ok to discuss things like that!!  Yeah, you might get some<br/>
questions or advice for the fears and doubts, but I think that&#39;s a<br/>
good thing.<br/>
<br/>
I really enjoy certain types of support groups (I started Imagination<br/>
Tribe for that purpose) but for the topic of unschooling I prefer<br/>
discussion....so I&#39;m not very helpful I&#39;m afraid.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-740391072">Thanks Ren, I do need GROWTH via encouragement, :-)  Maybe I&#39;ve<br/>
misread a post here or there and had a little mind clutter but for<br/>
some reason I wasn&#39;t sure if it was okay to ask support type<br/>
questions.  I&#39;m glad that I can ask them here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1228240981">&quot;Wow!  I didnï¿½t know that Renï¿½s son didnï¿½t read until then, but<br/>
I knew that he only recently started to enjoy writing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let me clarify...he doesn&#39;t really &quot;enjoy writing&quot; in the sense that<br/>
he writes for pleasure, he writes when it&#39;s useful to him for a game<br/>
or other purpose.<br/>
<br/>
He began reading fluently AFTER he turned 12. Most of his fluent<br/>
reading has happened this very year (he turned 12 in August) but he<br/>
went from asking me to read almost everything to absorbing and reading<br/>
almost anything recently.<br/>
<br/>
Last night he was working very hard on a Zelda game. He had the<br/>
walk-through up on my compuer and when he hit snags he&#39;d come running<br/>
in and read how to deal with that area. A walk-through is one of the<br/>
most technical, detailed and BORING (only to me of course) bits of<br/>
writing in the world.  I tried reading some of it and could not wrap<br/>
my mind around it. Very detailed stuff.  He was reading it AND<br/>
applying that information in a way that made sense. He was using it to<br/>
decode a game.  NOT simple reading at all.<br/>
<br/>
Trust. It always comes back to that simple word. You can&#39;t have<br/>
unschooling without it...but you have to constantly up your trust<br/>
quotient to get to the next level.:)  <br/>
<br/>
At first you trust that your child will learn outside of school, then<br/>
you begin to trust that they don&#39;t need lessons and curriculum, then<br/>
you realize they really need only a RICH and interesting and<br/>
supportive environment in order to learn well.<br/>
<br/>
In every step, the trust had to come first, THEN you see natural<br/>
learning unfold. When we hit that pocket of fear, it&#39;s OUR job to work<br/>
through it without dumping our shit on our children. Lots of internal<br/>
dialogue, lots of talking at the lists and lots of questioning can<br/>
help work through those rough spots.<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;ve come a LONG way in a short time Sandy...it&#39;s been so<br/>
much fun to hear how the unschooling journey is flowing in your home.<br/>
 And it&#39;s really great to hear how you&#39;re standing up to your dh and<br/>
he&#39;s responding.  That&#39;s how we got 100% to unschooling...I had to<br/>
really be convinced enough to tell him to trust ME if he couldn&#39;t<br/>
trust the kids.  You should hear him in discussions now, totally<br/>
cracks me up that he was ever unsure.<br/>
