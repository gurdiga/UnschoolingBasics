I would suggest going to an allergist to start with.  Some kids have these problems because of certain food allergies/sensitivities.  Some have Candida (yeast) overgrowth.  Some respond well to the Gluten Free diet (and some need to also eliminate Casein as well).  My oldest son does best when he limits dairy and wheat.  He is able to handle those in small amounts.  He also did an herbal yeast elimination treatment (buy the herbal drops/capsules at the health food store).  We did the Gluten Free/Casein Free diet with limited success, but we only stayed on it for 2 months and I know it could take much longer than that to see any real results.   He also does well when he avoids artificial food colors and additives.  He has not had any symptoms of Aspergers for almost 2 years now.  <br/>
<br/>
My 5 yr old is much more complex.  We&#39;ve tried all of the above with him, but I haven&#39;t been able to pinpoint exactly what foods are affecting him.  He is *finally* going to get allergy testing done this week, and we are also having him tested for Celiac Disease (which I&#39;ve read, surprisingly, could be a reason for all kinds of abnormal behavior).  My son has a lot of the symptoms of it.  Over the years my son has seen several doctors including neurologists (for possible seizures a few yrs ago, but did not do further testing to confirm).  I didn&#39;t get much help from doctors, so I really read up on all of my sons issues and that&#39;s how I found out about the affect of diet on a person&#39;s mental and behavioral state (now that&#39;s a fine example of unschooling!).  Now I know enough to go in and tell the doctor specifically which tests I want done.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope that was helpful in some way.  ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-382274935">We are actually on a Gluten Free Diet.  I have not had the formal allergy testing done, but my holistic Dr. is the one that told me she is allergic to wheat and has a yeast overgrowth.  We will probably have the allergy testing done at some point.  And we had figured out on our own that she was intolerant of corn and food dyes.  Since we started the Gluten Free Diet she has not had one single Rage.  So we will see over the next few months how things play out.  I&#39;m hoping a good, clean diet of whole foods will really help.  I hope you find some answers for your son.<br/>
