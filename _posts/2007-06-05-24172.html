<div id="ygrps-yiv-1059065086">What do you think of it?<br/>
<br/>
Which package did you go with?<br/>
<br/>
Do you get any premium channels?<br/>
<br/>
How about High Definition? if so, what is it like?<br/>
<br/>
We got this offer in the mail to get Dish Network and the pricing<br/>
doesnt seem bad but for the channels we all were wanting it looks like<br/>
we would &quot;need&quot; America&#39;s Top 250.. Only reason is because we all<br/>
really want The Science Channel.  We are huge Science lovers.  It<br/>
seems it is only offered in that package.  So does anyone have this<br/>
channel? if so, what is it like?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-730339262">We have Direct Tv not the Dish but we have the Science channel and we<br/>
love it. My DD and I watch How its Made all the time and also many<br/>
cool shows about planets. We also have Animal planet, National<br/>
Geographic and the history channels that we watch a lot. For me, it is<br/>
the only reason we have Direct Tv. But my other DD watches all the<br/>
Disney channels and the Food Network. We found that the pricing was<br/>
better than cable but when it rains really bad the reception goes in<br/>
and our. But tivo is really cool.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-554598292">We have Dish and we love it!<br/>
<br/>
We have a High Def package and Dish has the most High Def channels right <br/>
now.  Our kids (almost 6 and 2.5) love Animania on HD.  We didn&#39;t get <br/>
any premium movie channels because we usually end up renting the movies <br/>
we want to see before they come out on the movie channels.  Plus, there <br/>
are free weekends for the movie channels every now and then, and always <br/>
a few channels to preview free every month.<br/>
<br/>
I just checked our package and we don&#39;t get The Science Channel, so I <br/>
can&#39;t tell you if it&#39;s good or not.  You might want to go to their <br/>
website (the Science Channel) and see what kinds of shows they offer.  <br/>
Discovery HD is pretty awesome though, it&#39;s what the National Geographic <br/>
channel should be.<br/>
<br/>
We have a HD DVR and a regular DVR.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1832621777">Have it. Love it. We have one of the mid-range packages. It is easier<br/>
to search for things and you can schedule shows with their timer<br/>
thing. It takes a day or two to get used to the differences from cable<br/>
but we think the picture is better and we wouldn&#39;t go back. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-470096558">We have Dish with everything but HD because we don&#39;t have an HD tv. We <br/>
chose Dish because it seemed less sport intensive and at the time seemed <br/>
to have more sci history channels.We have a DVR which we can not live <br/>
without. We check the guide each week and tape all the things that look <br/>
interesting. Then there is always something to watch when he is in the <br/>
mood.  My son recently discovered Discovery Kids and can&#39;t get enough of <br/>
it. Particularly Time Warp Trio a cartoon about time travel, Bonehead <br/>
Detectives (we DVR because it is on at 3am) and Prehistoric Planet. [He <br/>
is 9 and in a dinosaur phase:) ] He also likes  How It Made, Modern <br/>
Marvels, and occasionally a good  International Profiles just to name a <br/>
few....<br/>
