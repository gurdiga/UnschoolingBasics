<br/>
Well, do you see books as evil, just because there are books worshipping Satan or condoning murder? Just because a form of communication has positive and negative qualities, do we ban or limit that in our children&#39;s lives? Or should we trust them to know what is &quot;crap&quot; and what fascinatest them?<br/>
I trust that if something is really interesting to my child, they are getting a lot out of it. Shows that I thought were &quot;crap&quot; many years ago, have been a wonderful opportunity for learning (Ed, Ed and Eddy, The Simpsons, South Park).<br/>
If you have a sensitive child, or have sensitivities yourself, that all comes into play. You wouldn&#39;t just turn on some violent show that you know would bother them! That&#39;s not what we&#39;re advocating. Kids don&#39;t WANT to watch stuff they aren&#39;t ready for.<br/>
I think tv has gotten a bad rap, and I see no reason for unschoolers to fear and demonize ANY form of communication. Just like books, or radio or computers, you use the parts that enhance your life and leave the rest. I trust my children to do the same.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1469188999">Okay, so this is a subject I have been thinking about for a while and here<br/>
goes.  I have been up and down the charts on TV issues, and certainly myself<br/>
struggled with whether there is some kind of &quot;instrinsic&quot; good or badness to<br/>
TV and how I feel about my children watching it all day.  Having read a lot<br/>
of posts on this and another unschooling message board, I have come to feel<br/>
that it is in fact more useful for me to see it as a tool - one that can<br/>
certainly be abused (I have definitely seen folks who use it as a kind of<br/>
drug to shut problems and the world out) or used well.<br/>
<br/>
However, since I have put the &quot;good/bad&quot; issue to the side, I have come to<br/>
see other issues with TV that seem at least in our house to require more<br/>
than just letting each kid watch whatever they want whenever they want.  I<br/>
do want to say that I completely respect folks for whom that works out and<br/>
for whom no other issues arise!  In our house we have found several issues -<br/>
in addition to the one Ren talked about - the fact that you wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
your sensitive children watch things that would traumatize them and give<br/>
them nightmares for weeks (and my daughter gets too scared to watch Disney<br/>
movies so that is a big consideration around here).  For us this is not just<br/>
adult material.  My daughter or son may pick out a video to watch that<br/>
scares the other one - even the sound of it or the &quot;knowledge that the one<br/>
that scares me is on&quot; is enough to terrify my very sensitive daughter, or<br/>
even my not quite so sensitive son.  So we end up talking a lot about<br/>
considering the other person&#39;s feelings.  Since my daughter is five, she is<br/>
able to better empathize and do in any situation what she would like done if<br/>
she were in the other person&#39;s shoes.  With my three year old son, who does<br/>
not have that level, I sometimes have to &quot;help&quot; him find a solution that&#39;s<br/>
fair (since he thinks it&#39;s fine for him to watch what scares my dd but to<br/>
stop her from watching what scares him).  Right now we are doing fairly well<br/>
with finding videos we all like, or agreeing to special time with Mama in<br/>
the farthest away room possible while the &quot;scary&quot; video is on, but sometimes<br/>
that doesn&#39;t work and I can&#39;t see that protecting the video watching child&#39;s<br/>
right to choose the video over the right of the child who finds it scary to<br/>
have a safe feeling emotional environment is right.<br/>
<br/>
Another issue we&#39;ve struggled with is I have discovered that I as a person<br/>
require a certain amount of peace and quiet in my living environment.  This<br/>
is very different from my husband who loves having the noise of TV or the<br/>
radio on in the background.  I find after a time the noise of the TV (and<br/>
for me that includes &quot;visual&quot; noise that catches my eye when I go by) or the<br/>
radio gives me headaches, makes me cranky and just drives me to the point I<br/>
want to crawl out of my skin.  I should point out that we live in a very<br/>
small two bedroom house, so it&#39;s difficult to find space to get away from<br/>
that.  Interestingly enough since I have brought this issue up for<br/>
discussion with my children, my daughter has voiced similar feelings and<br/>
asked for more overall quiet herself.  My son went through a period around<br/>
the age of just turning 3 where he wanted to watch videos all the time and<br/>
it was an issue with noise for both me and my daughter.  In this way, I view<br/>
TV as different from books (to which it is so often compared in unschooling<br/>
posts) - it has an output into the general environment in which we all live<br/>
that does impact me (and it seems my dd) in a way that we need honored.<br/>
<br/>
The other issue we&#39;ve decided to form an agreement around (and I do believe<br/>
in talking and forming agreements based on everyone&#39;s feelings instead of<br/>
imposing arbitrary limits, although that ability is limited in kids younger<br/>
than about the age of 4 unless they can empathize really early) is when they<br/>
ask to invite other kids over to play, then by the time the other kids get<br/>
here, five minutes into it one of them wants to watch a video.  Then the kid<br/>
who got invited over gets mad because they came to play and they don&#39;t want<br/>
to watch a video, or not that video (which if we watch the ones they all<br/>
want in succession turns into a long bout of TV watching during which the<br/>
children who&#39;s video is not on resent the fact that the other kids are not<br/>
available to them to play).  We had long talks about this which involved<br/>
feeling out how my dd would feel if she went to someone else&#39;s house to play<br/>
and the video situation happened.  We decided it wasn&#39;t fair to invite<br/>
someone over with the expectation of playing, then turn on a video, and it<br/>
made more sense to have a general agreement for the TV to go off when<br/>
someone comes over to play, unless we have specifically invited them over to<br/>
watch a certain thing that has been agreed to ahead of time, and to ask them<br/>
(and by this I mean her cousins whom she sees regularly) to do the same if<br/>
we go to their house to play.  This agreement has worked out really well and<br/>
even my 3 year old now who couldn&#39;t really get it at first now gleefully<br/>
pops up to turn it off when someone arrives to play.<br/>
<br/>
So I guess I am saying that beyond issues of intrinsic goodness and badness<br/>
of TV it does to me seem to have other impacts in our house which have been<br/>
important to discuss and arrange some type of agreements around so that<br/>
everyone&#39;s feelings and choices can be honored as much as possible when they<br/>
can be so different.<br/>

 <br/>
Our experience has been backwards:<br/>
 <br/>
Kids that are limited at home (tv and video games) come over and want  to <br/>
watch tv or play video games. Duncan wants to play outside or swim or play  board <br/>
games or bake cookies or..... They ONLY want to watch tv or play video  games <br/>
because the can&#39;t at home.<br/>
 <br/>
Duncan has started hiding the Game Cube and X-box so that he can get them  to <br/>
play.<br/>

My kids are 13, 16, and 19 now. The 19 yo is the one who was super <br/>

movies - they were too violent and scary for her when she was around 5 <br/>
to 8 years old. She&#39;d have nightmares - she STILL has really vivid <br/>
dreams that are much influenced by movies and tv. The now-16 yo always <br/>
&quot;gets it&quot; that it is a movie, is never so caught up that she forgets it <br/>
is &quot;just a movie&quot; and can watch absolutely anything without being <br/>
freaked out because she&#39;s always got part of her mind focused on the <br/>
technical side of the film - the acting, the lighting, the music, how <br/>
they do the special effects, etc. The 13 yo is not upset by scary <br/>
movies, but is completely destroyed by &quot;sad&quot; movies - we all have to be <br/>
REALLY careful about that. She&#39;s better able to handle it now - but we <br/>
made some mistakes in the past - &quot;My Dog Skip&quot; was a big blunder - she <br/>
was about 11 when we watched it and she sobbed all night over it. The <br/>
first time she watched West Side Story (we are HUGE musical theater <br/>
fans around here) was the same thing - she just fll apart into a puddle <br/>
- I don&#39;t know what we were thinking to not warn her away from that <br/>
one.<br/>
<br/>
And I am the person in the family who slowly gets crankier and <br/>
grouchier when there is constant sound (3 teenage girls - all singers - <br/>
husband who loves sports on tv - think about it).<br/>
<br/>
1. Cordless headphones for the tv - especially for my husband watching <br/>
sports<br/>
2. Personal portable cd players for the kids - with headphones, of <br/>
course - even when they were little kids they had personal portable <br/>
tape players for music and stories - lots of story tapes from <br/>
Scholastic.<br/>
3. A little tv/dvd in my oldest daughter&#39;s room because she likes it on <br/>
a lot more than anybody else - while she&#39;s crocheting or knitting or <br/>
drawing or collaging....<br/>

These are the things that saved my sanity over the years.<br/>

Subject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] TV - Issues of Imact Beyond Good and<br/>
Evil<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Working those issues out is SO great though - that&#39;s a good reason to<br/>
NOT have arbitrary tv limits. If you, as mom, just said, &quot;You may watch<br/>

<br/>
Gosh, good point.  I do think that some of it has felt somewhat arbitrary to<br/>
my son since he is not really at that age of agreements yet - I really can&#39;t<br/>
wait till he gets there - but we have talked about what&#39;s behind it and<br/>
continue to talk.  I will say that before I let go as much as I could of my<br/>
worrying about TV as good or evil I could not see these issues - I would<br/>
just blame the outcome on &quot;the badness of TV&quot; - so putting that to the side<br/>
enabled me to see the real stuff we needed to work on.  Right now we all<br/>
seem to be really in sync and content about all of our needs regarding the<br/>
TV so I&#39;m thinking somehow it has worked out so far.  I will say that<br/>
reading your statement above about arbitrary versus agreed upon limits made<br/>
me quite relieved since I had gotten the impression - primarily from another<br/>
unschooling email list I left - that if my kids had anything other than<br/>
unlimited access to all of TV, I was somehow missing the point and missing<br/>
the boat and I felt quite excluded.<br/>
<br/>

I so agree with you.  The issues you find beyond the &quot;good/evil&quot; <br/>
issues are the same for us at our house.  I felt like I was reading <br/>
my own words.  lol!  There are a lot more things to consider than <br/>
just if tv is good or bad.  <br/>

&gt; The other issue we&#39;ve decided to form an agreement around (and I do <br/>

 </span></blockquote>kids get<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; here, five minutes into it one of them wants to watch a video.  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then the kid<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; feeling out how my dd would feel if she went to someone else&#39;s <br/>
 </span></blockquote>house to play<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and the video situation happened.  We decided it wasn&#39;t fair to <br/>
