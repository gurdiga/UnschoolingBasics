<div id="ygrps-yiv-982172751">I have been having the same trouble with my 3 year old.  I figured out a few things about his name calling: 1) he uses it as a defense mechanism, like when he&#39;s nervous or whatever (he called the &quot;haircutters&quot; long poopers : )because he was scared of them) 2) he does it when he wants to get a rise out of someone (he especially likes calling his grandpas stupid because he wants them to chase him or something)  3)the more someone tells him it&#39;s not nice the more he does it.  Anyhow, those are my observations so far and I still haven&#39;t figured out if he needs more help getting through this or if it&#39;s just a phase.  But so far, it has only been a big deal to one of my SILs.  I usually just say, &quot;Oh, are you trying to get their attention? (with a goofy giggle and a grin)&quot; or &quot;Oh are you nervous? (with a hug)&quot;  I know that he is not trying to hurt someone else, but rather to protect himself.  Maybe you could figure out why your son is doing it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sounds like a power struggle in the making. To what point do you want  <br/>
to carry the power struggle?<br/>
<br/>
Think of name calling as one of your personal buttons. He&#39;s found it.  <br/>
And he&#39;s pushing it and it makes you react. Think how powerful that  <br/>
is for a powerless person! Basically he&#39;s found &quot;When I do this, I  <br/>
can make this more powerful person do that!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s important to give kids information when they&#39;ve crossed our  <br/>
personal boundaries, but if they persist there&#39;s something else going  <br/>
on. (Though we do  have to do a lot of stretching of personal  <br/>
boundaries if we want kids in our lives!)<br/>
<br/>
How about humor? Call him silly names when he calls you dumb :-) He  <br/>
can&#39;t push if you disconnect the button!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>couple things- one is that it is interesting that you do not <br/>
remember the conversation but the name calling- he might have <br/>
noticed you paid much much attention to that as well and discovered <br/>
a way to get your attention- <br/>
<br/>
the other is that name calling is highly suggestive- when my 5 yr <br/>
old comes up with a new name to call someone I usually ask her what <br/>
does that mean and a lot of times she has no idea<br/>
<br/>
name calling in FUN is not abusive- though name calling can be- I <br/>
think children look for ways to &quot;name call&quot; kind of like when they <br/>
are learning that things have names and their lives have consisted <br/>
of calling things names- you name call a cup by calling it a cup- <br/>
you name call the dog by calling it a dog- <br/>
<br/>
we usually name name calliing humorous- <br/>
<br/>
does he  know what dumb means- was he feeling at the moment that you <br/>
were dumb- were you listening with half an ear and the thought you <br/>
were dumb by not listening- <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-858106434">My 4yo used to do this. I can&#39;t remember now what all the names were. <br/>
I think I told him a few times that I didn&#39;t like being called names. <br/>
He continued it for a while. I hadn&#39;t realized it until I read this <br/>
post but he seems to have stopped. I can&#39;t remember the last time he <br/>
called me or his dad a name or what it was. He still calls the baby <br/>
stupid sometimes. I don&#39;t really say much about that. It&#39;s his way of <br/>
expressing annoyance at the baby for bothering him. The baby doesn&#39;t <br/>
know what it means yet so no harm done. I might just say something <br/>
about how he is baby and doesn&#39;t really understand what he&#39;s doing or <br/>
isn&#39;t as capable of controlling himself physically as an older person. <br/>
Anyway, my point was that my son did this at some point but has pretty <br/>
much stopped. Just a phase maybe?<br/>

a way to *find out* what the word means from the way adults respond, so <br/>
its exciting to me that she&#39;s finally started asking. <br/>

<br/>
Yes, I thought that as well after I sent it.  I can just see me attempting<br/>
to be &quot;serious&quot; and him laughing at me and continuing to call me dumb.<br/>
<br/>
That original response came from my fear of going on this trip with my<br/>
parents and siblings in August.  I imagined Khalid calling me dumb and their<br/>
response, or what they would think my response should be.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reminding that it&#39;s just life, and he&#39;s just 5.<br/>
