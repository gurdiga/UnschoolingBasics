<div id="ygrps-yiv-1680204133">Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to give a basic intro.  Since I started posting replies before I got around to one, I figured it was time to say &#39;hello&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
I have 3 boys, who have all been homeschooled from day one--without much structure.  I never intended to homeschool.  But I thought unschooling was too far out there for me.  I have had a hard struggle to get where I am today with my patience and challenging all of my hang-ups w/rules and limits, and discipline, and hardest of all for me--punishment.  I have definitely evolved into this and all of that is due to my oldest giving me constant solid, honest feedback about how he feels he should be treated and what makes sense to his &#39;education&#39;.  He&#39;s an incredible kid, as are his younger brothers.  I honestly feel like I have so much to learn from them.  It&#39;s humbling.<br/>
<br/>
My boys are not the model unschoolers that I have heard about so often.  But they are awesome!!  By model unschoolers I mean that I couldn&#39;t go on the Dr. Phil show or do a special w/CNN and show off our awesome achievements or travels.  We live a pretty ordinary life.  They have pretty typical interests--but they interest me and I enjoy listening to what they want to share.  I&#39;m currently learning about Shiny and Rare Pokemon with my 9 & 6 yr old as well as how to say small words and count in spanish w/Dora and Diego shows w/my 3 yr. old. Sometimes I inspire my boys but it doesn&#39;t last for long...they&#39;re usually treading new paths for me.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m committed to positive, respectful parenting (though I have so many regrets that I didn&#39;t get here earlier).   And to me, unschooling is a natural progression out of that.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking for more support than I have in real life as I find myself feeling guilty I don&#39;t share the same limits other friends of mine do with their children, but am tired of feeling guilty about it, too.  I&#39;m finding that I have sort of out-grown the local homeschool support but am not sure where to find the type of support we need, in our community.  I joined a bunch of lists, some of which are local, some that aren&#39;t--including this one.  I look forward to seeing where the support I&#39;m looking for comes from.  And enjoying the process of getting to know others along the way. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s about it. :) ...and, yikes!...it wasn&#39;t the short intro I set out to write! o_0<br/>

<br/>
Hey there from one &quot;Poke-Mom&quot; to another. I&#39;ve even got a Poke-<br/>
spouse! My guys (hubby and almost 9 yr old DS)have recently been <br/>
deeply into the new Pearl and Diamond games on the DS. (and yes, my <br/>
son has realized how odd it is that he&#39;s my DS with a DS!) Probably <br/>
the coolest feature is that there&#39;s a &quot;Global Trade Station&quot; that is <br/>
*literally* global. It works over wi-fi/Internet connection and you <br/>
can trade Pokemon with folks around the world! The one <br/>
small &quot;glitch&quot; we&#39;ve stumbled on is that when you receive a Pokemon <br/>
from someplace like Japan, the Pokemon&#39;s nickname is in *Japanese* <br/>
characters! Both DH and DS have a couple Pokemon that they have no <br/>
idea what their names are.<br/>
<br/>
Any of you Poke-folks out there have any ideas (I think they can go <br/>
in and re-name them but it would be more fun just to see their name, <br/>
as intended, but in English characters)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2013281414">Wikipedia has a huge list of pokemon. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon</a> If you click on the <br/>
pokemon&#39;s name often there is a picture and a rundown of their stats. The <br/>
Japanese names are also listed there.<br/>
