Goodness NO.<br/>
We are homeschoolers technically. There aren&#39;t separate laws for those<br/>
that use Charlotte Mason or any other philosophy. YOu are responsible<br/>
for the laws of your state. There are many creative ways to meet the<br/>
law as an unschooler. <br/>
Talking to other unschoolers in your state is the best way to figure<br/>
that out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1126773472">We did not home school while living in NC, however, we had looked into it. We did not have to have an approved curriculum North Carolina requirements are fairly easy for any style of homeschooling, they do prefer that at least one of the teachers have or be working on a college degree, though they will accept a high school diploma or GED. You need to fill out a form from the North Carolina Division of Non-Public Education, here is the link to their site as well: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ncdnpe.org/hhh103.">http://www.ncdnpe.org/hhh103.</a> htm. As for progress, hang on to cool neat projects that are done, attendance isn&#39;t hard to do either, technically an unschooler never misses a single day. What is set on paper and what actually happens anywhere is not always the same. What I learned from my classroom training and clinical training as a nurses aide helped when I first started to work, but it left out a lot of things such as facility policies and procedures which can over ride what is in the text<br/>
 book. Not quite the same scenario, but I was just trying to empahsize that the home school requirements are not as stringent as they actually appear on paper and that you can make your record keeping reflect what the state law requires. I called and spoke at length with the NCDNPE, and they had no problem with us creating our curriculum, it was up to us to make sure our children learned. The only real pain in the butt was having to have standardized testing done once a year, you have to pay for this and it is expensive. But contact the NCDNPE and speak with their reps, they were most helpful. There are also some really good support groups in NC that can help you wade through all the legal mumbo jumbo.<br/>
<br/>
Also, keep in mind unschooling is still home schooling, just a different method and one that is more of a lifestyle than just a way of teaching. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-829629547">That&#39;s not NC law, those are NC *suggestions*. I&#39;m not being snarky,<br/>
it&#39;s true! Under NC law, there are these requirements, besides<br/>
notifying the state you&#39;re homeschooling & at least one parent holding<br/>
a high-school diploma:<br/>
<br/>
1) Maintain an attendance record<br/>
<br/>
2) Have vax records or proof of exemption on site<br/>
<br/>
3) Student must take accredited test yearly<br/>
<br/>
4) Operate the school &quot;on a regular schedule, excluding reasonable<br/>
holidays and vacations, during at least nine calendar months of the year&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s it. Nowhere does it say anything about attending class,<br/>
studying, etc. Our school is operational 24/7, so we meet the<br/>
requirement. The law DEFINITELY doesn&#39;t say anything about curriculum!!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m posting this here, even though it&#39;s state specific, to point out<br/>
the need to know the actual laws of your state - not suggestions or<br/>
ways other people do things. Take the time and read the actual laws,<br/>
they&#39;re usually easy to find.<br/>
<br/>
Like Ren said, if you connect with other unschoolers in your area,<br/>
they&#39;ll tell you how they deal with the law. A lovely group in NC is<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1777926166">In NC we are &quot;required&quot; to do three things... maintain an attendance<br/>
record (I check off 180 days and put it in my file... any 180 days<br/>
will do!), maintain an immunization or exemption record and administer<br/>
a standardized test once a year.   They suggest 180 days of &quot;regular&quot;<br/>
attendance, certain number of hours a day etc.   In NC there is NO<br/>
curriculum approval... suggested or otherwise... not sure where that<br/>
confusion came from but there is nothing like that.   Every year you<br/>
will receive (seems you won&#39;t get one until you have homeschooled 2 or<br/>
3 years) a &quot;voluntary&quot; inspection by mail card where they ask a few<br/>
questions and want to know if you would like to participate in the<br/>
voluntary inspection by mail by sending in your attendance record and<br/>
test scores.   ALL totally voluntary .. I have thrown mine in the<br/>
trash each year for 12 years with no ill effects.  In NC there is no<br/>
requirement for the children to score a certain score on the<br/>
standardized test, no one checks your curriculum or tests your kids<br/>
etc.   In NC we are considered private schools and with the exception<br/>
of the 3 requirements we are pretty much on our own to decide what we<br/>
do.   <br/>
