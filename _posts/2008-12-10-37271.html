<div id="ygrps-yiv-370099742">Aaahhh...the sushi alone is a tempting offer....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Both my boys are up there in the NE (Boston area) *now* (both hoping for some SNOW!)....maybe I should have Cameron swing by on his way home next week. Load up! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah---we&#39;re on to the tent idea. The tarp&#39;s a good idea too (thanks---we have several). Last time Danny was here (Nov 5, 2006), it was COLD (yeah, yeah, yeah---everything&#39;s relative, Yankee-girl!). And although we have plenty of chairs, you wouldn&#39;t believe how cold air travels through those seats! We were sooo much warmer all snuggled up in blankets on the *ground*. So I&#39;ll need to remember that!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll figure it out. With any luck, though, it&#39;ll be 65 and sunny! &lt;G&gt; Today&#39;s cloudy and 73. T-shirt weather!!! I&#39;ll keep you posted.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh! And I&#39;m still looking for that keyboard. I know it&#39;s here *somewhere*---I may need to wait for the boys to come home. Let them crawl around in the attic. It&#39;s probably somewhere under the 400 stuffed animals! &lt;g&gt; I&#39;ll let you know what I find---and whether that stuffed alligator eats me! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2046393149">LOL well they had a little bit of snow the other day but not much<br/>
(unless Boston didn&#39;t get even the little bit we got down here in CT).<br/>
They&#39;re getting a ton of rain which would be a nasty nor-easter if the<br/>
temps dropped some. If they do need to drop by and get the tents, let us<br/>
know so we can dig them out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1708938945">Mmm...don&#39;t think it would travel really well. But, if he&#39;s coming down<br/>
through the area, I know a couple good sushi places right off I-84...we<br/>
could even meet up there and have a nice lunch maybe (since he&#39;d likely<br/>
be in the area around noon if he left Boston area mid morning-ish).<br/>
