<div id="ygrps-yiv-885350710">My heart broke when I read Ren&#39;s post about Hannah.  It made me think back<br/>
to the posts about parents feeling resentful about cleaning up behind our<br/>
children or being overwhelmed with clothes to wash and not feeling like we<br/>
have any help from our children.  Today I will feel joy over messes to clean<br/>
up behind and clothes to wash and fold.  Because today I have the privilege<br/>
of being home with my girls and enjoy life with them. Today I can enjoy<br/>
their laughs and fusses!  Wow, how one event like this can bring gratitude<br/>
for what one has to a whole new level.  My thoughts and prayers of comfort<br/>
are surrounding this family today.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-825813529">Yeah, Tracey, this whole thing has given me a big slap and a reality check. <br/>
I believe an attitude adjustment and a different perspective in how I look<br/>
at life is in order. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1508794383">I have felt the same way.<br/>
<br/>
Everytime I cleaned up spilled chocolate milk today, I thought what would my <br/>
life be like if my precious son wasn&#39;t here to spill that milk.<br/>
<br/>
Folding laundry today was so different from before.<br/>
<br/>
Getting bedtime drinks for the 20th time tonight felt like I was so blessed <br/>
to have my babies here in my home, in my arms, within my reach.........being <br/>
able to hug them all so many times they asked me why I was being so &quot;huggy&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I believe my way of thinking has been changed even more than before.<br/>
<br/>
I truly am blessed to have a whole tribe of kids & wonderful friends here & <br/>
IRL.<br/>
<br/>
Peace to all<br/>
Goodnight<br/>
Hug your kids tight<br/>
<br/>
~Carol~<br/>
