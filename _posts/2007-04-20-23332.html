QUO VADIS READY FOR ITS SIXTH YEAR<br/>
We are excited to announce that registration is now open for Quo Vadis, <br/>
an annual event that draws together adults interested in education that <br/>
is empowering.<br/>
<br/>
Quo Vadis is an event where young and old, traditionally and <br/>
nontraditionally educated, parents, college students, and educators of <br/>
all types come together to meet, network and learn from one another.  <br/>
The event will be taking place June 15-21 at Camp Lane, outside of <br/>
Eugene, OR.<br/>
<br/>
Originally founded as a retreat for self-taught, home schooled, or <br/>
unschooled young adults, Quo Vadis is partly a social event with time <br/>
for games and one-on-one conversations, partly a conference with <br/>
participant-led workshops as eclectic as the participants themselves, <br/>
partly a retreat set in the Siuslaw National Forest area, and partly an <br/>
ongoing experiment. It is wholly a place for those interested in <br/>
exploring the meaning and practice of education with others.<br/>
<br/>
“[Quo Vadis is] an amazing opportunity to learn from others, open one&#39;s <br/>
mind to alternative learning, and meet dynamic, compassionate, <br/>
open-minded, intelligent individuals who are working towards <br/>
accomplishing their dreams and affecting positive change in the world,” <br/>
according to previous attendee Lily Oglesby.<br/>
<br/>
New this year at Quo Vadis is the Young Adult Track, a weeklong program <br/>
designed specifically to address the needs of self-educated people <br/>
transitioning from adolescence to adulthood.  The Young Adult Track is <br/>
designed to inform, inspire, and empower participants to face the <br/>
future with confidence. Participants benefit from the focused <br/>
objectives and purpose of the track while still having access to the <br/>
workshops and fascinating people who attend Quo Vadis. For more <br/>
information about the Young Adult Track, check out <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://quovadisgathering.org/youngadulttrack.html">http://quovadisgathering.org/youngadulttrack.html</a><br/>
<br/>
The cost of Quo Vadis is $300 if you register before May 18 ($350 after <br/>
that); payment covers 6 days, 6 nights, and 17 delicious, organic meals!<br/>
<br/>
Due to increased interest in attending Quo Vadis from those unable to <br/>
take a full week out of a busy schedule, we offer a three-day <br/>
alternative from June 15  - 18. The cost for the three-day option is <br/>
$200, which covers Friday night through Monday morning’s meals, <br/>
workshops and Quo Vadis fun and inspiration.<br/>
<br/>
Because we are dedicated to providing an affordable gathering for all <br/>
and aspire never to turn away anyone solely for lack of funds, we offer <br/>
work trades as an alternative to paying for Quo Vadis.<br/>
<br/>
Space at the gathering is limited. To register online or for more <br/>
information about the gathering, go to www.quovadisgathering.org.  You <br/>
can also contact Quo Vadis Office Manager Gabriela Ranzi at <br/>
