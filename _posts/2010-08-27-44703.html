<div id="ygrps-yiv-875581328">Hi all,<br/>
I am currently preparing to fill out an application for my daughter<br/>
for a &quot;page in parlement&quot; program. The first hurdle is that to get<br/>
an applicaton, I was asked for her grade average as they only take<br/>
kids with high marks in school. I sent in a responce telling them that<br/>
she has no grade average as we have never done any tests. I offered a brief<br/>
resume of her learnings instead.  THis responce was accecpted. <br/>
I am looking forward to recieving the application this fall and I will be trying to offer a description of her learnings of the past years. She is of an age to be in grade 7.<br/>
If anyone has gone through this process before and has any advice, I would<br/>
appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>
