<div id="ygrps-yiv-1053494340">As I said in my intro, we&#39;re planning to unschool Sophia from the beginning.<br/>
She&#39;s seven months right now, and I&#39;m constantly concerned that her<br/>

about her development and so on (she&#39;s my first). One of the places I&#39;m<br/>
trying to put that energy is into &quot;preparing&quot; for unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I say &quot;preparing&quot; because how can you prepare for a spontaneous process? ;)<br/>

I wouldn&#39;t worry so much about later. The best preparation for unschooling is to be there with your beautiful girl NOW. Unschooling is really all about the NOW. It&#39;s about being present with our children and helping them explore their world.<br/>
<br/>
Since Sophia is so young, your job is to stay in her world and keep her in yours. Talk to her. Sing to her. Point things out. Carry her around. Let her see what you&#39;re doing. Let her explore under your supervision. Try to frame her world so that yes can be the default answer and no&#39;s can be kept to a minimum. <br/>
<br/>
As she grows, it will become more obvious what things she is drawn to. You can have the basics on hand and that should do fine. Have plenty of things to touch, smell, mouth, taste, listen to, climb on, crawl under, etc. Our kids enjoyed books and music from a very young age. They liked bubbles and play-doh and sand and Barney and on and on.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no magic unschooling cupboard that will have all the things your child will want or need. That&#39;s the beauty of it. Each child is different. Enjoy her today. When she needs something later on, it will be easy enough to figure out and accomodate at that time.<br/>

&quot;Just today I&#39;m going to be utterly present for my children, I&#39;m going to be in their world (not just doing my own thing while they do theirs), I&#39;m going to really hear them, I&#39;m going to prepare myself to be present starting right now.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1610203004">I recommend that you prepare by you becoming familiar with unschooling and hearing and seeing it in practice.  At your daughter&#39;s age, I don&#39;t think about stimulating the environment or helping them to learn ABC&#39;s in the future or any of that.  My main goal and objective is to let them be and explore their world.  For many years to come simple things will be more than enough for her to learn what babies and young children learn.  <br/>
<br/>
What has helped me in understanding the world of the young child is reading works by John Holt, I think he coined the term unschooling and definitely has championed its cause.  He helped me understand how children learn and how children fail.  If all you do is read posts from this group then you will be miles ahead as the years pass.  There is also www.unschooling.com and the Sandra Dodd and Living and Learning Conference websites that can provide a plethora of information that will support you in your decision to unschool.<br/>
<br/>
Trust is key to this process.  Trust you and your baby girl and you will not go wrong.  As a matter of fact, you will probably grow tenfold as a result and end up with an even more amazing relationship with your daughter.<br/>
<br/>
Much Love<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I saved a lot of stuff since I&#39;m a pack rat ;-) But probably the best  <br/>
thing was I put a box under the sink and just tossed in any little  <br/>
odd bits of plastic from packaging or metal or corks or freebie CDs  <br/>
or whatever. They came in handy for freeform sculptures and props.  <br/>
Though they didn&#39;t get used as much as I&#39;d expected since Kathryn  <br/>
doesn&#39;t like to use things up (must be a genetic thing ;-) it&#39;s still  <br/>
the thing I&#39;d do again.<br/>

Cut up used wrapping paper into sheets<br/>

Magazines with interesting pictures<br/>

My daughter ended up handling the collecting part pretty well  <br/>
herself! ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-481615116">You sound like me - search for developmental, open ended toys that will last<br/>
for at least two years and things that you can buy add-ons. Right now a ball<br/>
can make a long term toy but others you can look for are sorting toys, big<br/>
blocks. My daughter one still loves her crib toys - an aquarium dealy that<br/>
plays music and ocean sounds and bubbles, a kick/push one that makes a bunch<br/>
of noise and lights up and the old fashioned push this, pull that, look in<br/>
the mirror. Which one does she like the best? Well, it depends on the day<br/>
but usually the old fashioned one. We now have the attached to a bar stool<br/>
like a four way play center.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1478744952">I just purchased a guitar and a flute on ebay.  The guitar cost me $30.00 w/shipping and the flute (wooden from Peru) cost me $15.00.
