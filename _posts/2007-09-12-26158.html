<div id="ygrps-yiv-427248316">I just wanted to share a really cool poem I thought many of you would<br/>
enjoy having in your home. A new friend from the RE conference gave me<br/>
a copy and I&#39;ve been reading it every day.<br/>
<br/>
I posted a blog about it if you want to check it out: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://radicalunschooling.blogspot.com/">http://radicalunschooling.blogspot.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
Very uplifting and all about celebrating YOU (I think it would be very<br/>
empowering for children to hear).<br/>
