<div id="ygrps-yiv-1231355918">Hi all!<br/>
<br/>
I was hoping for some ideas and development info.<br/>
<br/>
My dd is 2 (28 months) and has indicated that she wants a microscope. She is not very verbal yet, so it&#39;s not that she is asking for it often, but we had been reading a Dr. Suess book for a few weeks that had a picture of one and she relayed the message that it was something she would like. I told her I would find her one.<br/>
<br/>
I was not thinking at the time that it would be a challenge for her to look into the hole! I did a lot of research and could not find one with a big eye piece, then I thought that I finally did find a slightly larger one, but I purchased it and upon receiving it today, find that I must have misunderstood. It is pretty small. <br/>
<br/>
I am wondering a few things...one is that I have no idea when kids are developmentally able to view something like this, when does the ability to close one eye and look in with the other begin? We have a little toy that has pictures in it and she can&#39;t view those, so I know she is not able to do it yet. <br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;d really like to give it to her, because she wants one and I like to hold true to my word to her, but I don&#39;t want her to be frustrated by it and I&#39;m not sure how to really make it possible for her or explain it to her. I&#39;d like her to keep her enthusiasm for whatever it is about the object that she likes. Any ideas are very welcome. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
Dina</div>

 </span></blockquote>Actually it&#39;s easier to keep both eyes open and use the dominant eye  <br/>
to look through the hole.<br/>
<br/>
You find your dominant eye by holding out your arm and pointing at  <br/>
something small in the distance (like the corner of a room). Close  <br/>
each eye and which ever eye doesn&#39;t shift your finger from the object  <br/>
is your dominant eye.<br/>
<br/>
I doubt a 2 yo would really need to go through that though ;-) If she  <br/>
can focus, either eye would work and she would probably naturally  <br/>
drift to using the dominant eye without realizing it.<br/>

really asking for.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d take her somewhere that had microscopes like a children&#39;s or  <br/>
science museum or even a college so she can try them out. Ask on a  <br/>
local list to see if someone has one you can borrow.<br/>
<br/>
Also try some other types of magnifiers which she might like even  <br/>
better since they&#39;re easier to use and portable. (Those are pretty  <br/>
much should haves anyway for an unschooler!)<br/>
<br/>
We have several magnifying glasses, as well as the flat sheets  <br/>
(Fresnel lens) that magnify.<br/>
<br/>
A photo magnifier would be great since she doesn&#39;t have to hold it:<br/>

If she really wants a microscope, a USB (also on that page but you  <br/>
might want to check Amazon for reviews of various styles) one might  <br/>
work better since she can see the image on the computer.<br/>

We have had one of these for years, the Intelplay by Matel.  It has 3<br/>
powers, easy for young kids, plugs into computer easily and also can be<br/>
removed from stand and hand held.  Very cool.  It was only $100 about 8<br/>
years ago.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-559722203">I would by a microscope for the future and a Eyeclops ( I think that is the name).<br/>
A cyclop is a camera that works as a microscope you connect to the tv.<br/>
We have one and love it!!!!!!!! We luckly got ours very cheap at the Goodwill store ( same with our microscope!)<br/>
Here is the link for one:<br/>

I realize it won&#39;t look exactly the same, and that you already have purchased on, but hopefully that helps.<br/>

Maybe that is not a question for an unschooling board but for an eye specialist?<br/>

place it over the corner before your eyes switch focus to your finger.<br/>
<br/>
Then try closing each eye to see which one shifts it off the corner.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We got out kids a dissection microscope (stereomicroscope) . All my research indicated that this type of microscope is the best type to get for the younger ages. My own experience as a kid, and from observation, is that a cell-level microscope is much more complicated to use, and gets boring fast with the younger ages. There was actually an article in the NYTimes written by a scientist that talked about this issue. With a stereomicroscope, you just plop the item on the platform - no preparing slides, etc. <br/>
<br/>
I used <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://greatscopes.com/,">http://greatscopes.com/,</a> which gave us a discount for homeschoolers. We also invested in extra eye pieces so that we could get greater magnification for our scope. At the time I bought it, my kids were 3 and 5 yrs. The 3 year old loved it a lot. Although most stereomicroscopes have 2 eyepieces, my 3 year old&#39;s eye width was too small to use both in the beginning. She was fine just using one eye. She is now 4 and can use 2 eyes fine. Unfortunately, there&#39;s a limit to how small they made the width between the eyepieces. If you talk to the own at the website above, he&#39;ll give you lots of good advice. Even now, both my kids regularly use the stereomicroscope to look at all sorts of things they find around the house and outside. I use it a lot myself and I love it. My now-7-year-old is now asking for a cell-level microscope, which I plan to save for and buy. But I&#39;m really glad we got the stereomicroscope first - it&#39;s just such a versatile and great intro to the micro world. <br/>
