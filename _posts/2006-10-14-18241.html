<div id="ygrps-yiv-1804087099">Hi, my name is Kelly.  I have two girls Lexi, 8 and Mariah 6.  We <br/>
are brand new at this.  I just pulled them out of public school <br/>
about 3 weeks ago.  So far I LOVE having my girls at home.  The <br/>
three of us are so much more relaxed.  No more pressure over stupid <br/>
Homework that was just a bunch of busy work!  Way more quality time <br/>
together.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway I am new to &quot;Unschooling&quot;, I really love the concept, but do <br/>
not fully understand it yet.  For three weeks I have let my girls <br/>
set the tone, and I&#39;ve just went along with it.  My 8 year old <br/>
previously detested Math, and would cry over Math homework.  Well <br/>
something miraculously has happened in just three weeks.  She loves <br/>
Math, and does it for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours a day now.........all <br/>
on her own, and occasionally will ask me for help. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to hear about other&#39;s &quot;Unschooling&quot; experiences.  I&#39;d also <br/>
like to know how everyone meets their state requirements for <br/>
homeschooling, while unschooling.  We live in SC and I think I will <br/>
meet the requirements and get the required subjects in, but I am not <br/>
