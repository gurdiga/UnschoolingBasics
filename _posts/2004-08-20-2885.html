<div id="ygrps-yiv-942022122">Hi June,<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t had this exact situation but when my son was younger my Mom<br/>
started saying, &quot;I hope he won&#39;t do THAT (whatever it was) forever&quot;.  After<br/>
the 2nd time she said that, I said, &#39;You know Mom, Grandma was very critical<br/>
of us kids and it made me not want to be around her.  I don&#39;t want that to<br/>
happen with you and Asher.&#39;  She stopped and thought and said, &quot;yes, point<br/>
well taken&quot;.  And I&#39;m happy to say she has never said anything like that<br/>
again.  I think what happened was she could see how it would effect her.<br/>
which motivated her to shift.  She probably remembered too how critical her<br/>
Mom was and didn&#39;t want to go THERE.<br/>

Great way to handle it! Made the point without being overly critical or<br/>
accusatory of your Mom.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>well with the majority of the human race ,,,it would be taken without it <br/>
being personal<br/>
but<br/>
with mom in law,,,everything,,,and i am not even exagerating,,,everything is <br/>
personal,,,or the person is hiding something...very sad my husabnd had to grow <br/>
up with it ,,,and wether she&#39;d accept it or not,k i can see where his mental <br/>
illness ,can be a result of ,,<br/>
but <br/>
it is better right now,to equipe the kids ,to answer their stupid questions <br/>
with the good manners they have and as much respect they can muster  in the <br/>
situation.<br/>
neither of the in-laws want to deal with me ,,,for what ever reason..maybe <br/>
they think i am crazy as a loon,,or maybe i intimidate them or they think i am <br/>
the resident bitch,,,dunno,,,dont care at this point,,,im trying to live my <br/>
life,,love God,myself, hubby and kids ,,,i have tried to talk to them ,,,i really <br/>
have no desire at this point to try to reason with the unreasonable...i have <br/>
no paitences for them or their crap,,,but i also am not going to argue my life <br/>
with them...none of their bussiness...<br/>
i just dont want to get uglywith them,,they would be soo self righteous then,,<br/>
im rambling,,,thanks for the suggestion...&gt;&gt;June<br/>
