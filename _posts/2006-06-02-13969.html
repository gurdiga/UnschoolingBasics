<div id="ygrps-yiv-2129738487">Well, I am one of the newbies on the list, I am certainly new to  <br/>
unschooling, actually, I think I may be more eclectic than unschooler at this  moment. I <br/>
feel drawn towards unschooling, don&#39;t want any curricullum, want to be  child <br/>
led in this learning adventure for my son, but as we all remember from my  <br/>
previous post about the spitting, I didn&#39;t handle that as well as I thought. I  <br/>
still have a lot to learn about being a more mindful parent. So I received a <br/>
bit  of a wake-up slap on the wrist. What was actually the most helpful was the  <br/>
reminder about the spitoons.... and it has made me realize I could have <br/>
handled  that better. Perhaps the next struggle will work out differently. <br/>
Obviously I  have not tucked tail and run off this list... in fact, last night I was <br/>
wishing  for some insight how to handle another situation.  <br/>
Anyway, still learning, still trying to better all aspects of the learning  <br/>
in this household, both for the kids and for the adults working/parenting  them.<br/>
thanks for the insights<br/>
