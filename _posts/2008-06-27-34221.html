<br/>
ARTS & HERITAGE ACTIVITY DAY<br/>
Date: Friday 12th September, 9.30am-4.30pm<br/>

<br/>
Schoolhouse has teamed up with local charity Angus Arts (run by home<br/>
educators) who will be organising a programme of arts activities for<br/>
participants of all ages in the local community centre. We are also <br/>
hoping to secure the involvement of the Arbroath Pageant Society, and <br/>

Abbey.<br/>
<br/>
INFORMAL CONFERENCE & FAMILY ACTIVITIES<br/>
Date: Saturday 13th September, 9.30am-4.30pm<br/>
Venue: Arbroath Community Centre<br/>

This will be a more informal day aimed exclusively at families<br/>
rather than organisations. John Taylor Gatto will deliver a second<br/>
presentation in the morning and there will be a number of workshop <br/>
sessions focusing on specific areas of interest to families as well <br/>
as opportunities for informal discussion. Arts and heritage <br/>
activities will run alongside the conference and workshop sessions.<br/>
<br/>
EVENING ENTERTAINMENT<br/>
Date: Friday 12th September or Saturday 13th September<br/>

ceilidh evening.<br/>
<br/>
CLOSING SESSION<br/>
Date: Sunday 14th September, morning only<br/>
Venue: Arbroath Community Centre<br/>
<br/>
This will provide an opportunity for participants to reflect on the <br/>
previous two days&#39; activities and discussions and consider ways <br/>
forward for freethinking educators. The morning&#39;s programme will be <br/>
informal and flexible.<br/>
