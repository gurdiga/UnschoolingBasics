&gt; She&#39;s never<br/>

&gt;Which means what? I don&#39;t think my daughter liked candy much at that  <br/>
age. At 2.5 my daughter had a similar food environment because there  <br/>
wasn&#39;t a reason to have snacky food around. But by 14 she&#39;s been  <br/>
exposed to lots of snacky foods and *still* without me hovering over  <br/>
her, without me training her on what&#39;s &quot;right&quot; to eat and what&#39;s  <br/>
&quot;wrong&quot;, eats well balanced meals. Yes, she has candy, she has an occasional<br/>
<br/>
soda but she prefers milk with a little chocolate. She prefers herbal  <br/>
tea to black tea.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure by the time my daughter is that age she will also have had that<br/>
exposure.  Each day she gets older she&#39;s exposed to more and more things.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;How will your daughter reconcile what you say about limiting foods  <br/>
that don&#39;t &quot;help people grow&quot; with people like my daughter who are  <br/>
healthy and well grown who do eat foods that won&#39;t &quot;help people  <br/>
grow&quot;? &lt;<br/>
<br/>
Again at dd&#39;s age your daughter would appear to be grown up.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;We do care as much about our kids as you do yours. If we let our kids have<br/>
<br/>
chocolate chips instead of carob chips it&#39;s not because we don&#39;t  <br/>
care. &lt;<br/>
<br/>
I want to make it clear that I don&#39;t feel anyone here doesn&#39;t care about<br/>
their kids, if you didn&#39;t you wouldn&#39;t be here.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;When you want to watch something, are you allowed?<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, but not always :)<br/>
<br/>
&gt;It will help you move towards whole life unschooling to not see it as  <br/>
allowing them but helping them do what they want and enjoy.&lt;<br/>
<br/>
That is a good way to look at things.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s okay if you don&#39;t want to move that direction. But any ideas  <br/>
that are posted *that hinder someone else* from moving that direction  <br/>
will be held up and examined.&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I know there are others on this site like me, and maybe some of them are on<br/>
the same page as me, maybe not.  I hope that my questions and comments and<br/>
the responses given help them to make decisions one way or another, as it<br/>
helps me.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;And there are plenty of people here who have teens -- who were 2.5 at  <br/>
one time! -- who *know* from experience it isn&#39;t necessary to control  <br/>
them until they can make the same decisions mom would.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
First of all I don&#39;t expect her to make exactly the same decisions I do.<br/>
Secondly it would be helpful to know who those of you who are that have<br/>
teenagers now and were radical unschoolers from the beginning.  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually they were much younger when we did this.  It was actually before we<br/>
even started unschooling.  Roly Poly Olie was fairly new on tv at the time<br/>
and that is where they got the idea.  So Mary Elayne may have been around 3<br/>
which means that Emily was around 6 and Keon a newborn.  However, I have<br/>
clear memories of them noticing the way food effected them long before<br/>
that.  Emily (who is now 13.5yo) has a sensitivity to Red Dye #40.  It does<br/>
really nasty things to her ability to rationalize and cope with minor<br/>
annoyances in her life.  When she was very young she would go into rages and<br/>
not even be able to tell me why she was going into rages.  When we did an<br/>
elimination diet and discovered this was a key to her behaviour and<br/>
eliminated this from her diet her life changed so much!  She was a different<br/>
(and fun to be with again) child.  She wasn&#39;t even 2 when we discovered<br/>
this.  She&#39;s known about this sensitivity ever since.  She also was able to<br/>
at a very young age recognize that her body was impacted by the foods she<br/>
ate, particularly RD40.  We helped her recognize what was happening to her<br/>
and she has chosen since then  whether to consume RD40 or whether to bypass<br/>
something that might make her feel badly.<br/>
<br/>
Just because a child doesn&#39;t recognize the connection doesn&#39;t mean we can<br/>
help them see the connection.  That&#39;s parenting.  Lack of limitations does<br/>
not mean we don&#39;t inform our children about things.  Would you warn someone,<br/>
a stranger for instance,  if you saw something dangerous?  Would  you yell<br/>
out for someone to stop if they stepped out into the street and didn&#39;t see a<br/>
car?  No difference with your children.  We are one of the facilitators of<br/>
their learning and that includes food.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Please do take a look at her articles.  See what other parents have<br/>
experienced with their children.  There are quite a few unschoolers who have<br/>
raised their children RU from birth.  Some of us had RU babies and then for<br/>
some reason decided to make them conform to a certain set of rules as they<br/>
got older.  Think of the moms that have breastfed babies that aren&#39;t<br/>
scheduled, fed on demand, co-slept, and self-weaned.  That&#39;s unschooling.<br/>
Then suddenly they are told that they have a bunch of rules to follow.  How<br/>
confusing is that.  I think one of the reasons that I saw my children&#39;s<br/>
preschool years as so difficult is because I pushed them through that<br/>
transition.   From freedom to restrictions.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

They all aren&#39;t Sandra&#39;s experiences.  So you are going to get more than one<br/>
person&#39;s perspective on how their lives were changed through unschooling!<br/>

feel you need to control her food when my daughter from the beginning  <br/>
had freedom to eat what she wanted when she wanted without a running  <br/>
commentary from me and has always when averaged over a week chosen a  <br/>
healthy diet?<br/>
<br/>
(Though from 4-10 it was more limited in terms of variety because  <br/>
things just didn&#39;t taste good to her, as many kids go through. As  <br/>
puberty came on her taste changed again and now there&#39;s little she  <br/>
doesn&#39;t like.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Again at dd&#39;s age your daughter would appear to be grown up.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>But she got there by eating things you&#39;ve told your daughter that  <br/>
don&#39;t &quot;help people grow&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
As questions came up I pointed out that there were foods with more  <br/>
nutrition and less nutrition. (I can&#39;t remember the contexts, but it  <br/>
was information, not meant to make her feel like not eating  <br/>
something.) I didn&#39;t tell her not to eat the less nutritious food.  <br/>
Because she had freedom to choose, her body naturally was drawn to  <br/>
take in the nutrition it needed. But she neither avoided nor overate  <br/>
less nutritious food.<br/>
<br/>
Why do you believe your daughter is less capable?<br/>

<br/>
There are also people who have had kids they&#39;ve controlled at the  <br/>
beginning and later kids they gave freedom to. You can ask what the  <br/>
differences were they found.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We just had a fondue dinner - cheese fondue with French bread and <br/>
chocolate fondue with marshmallows, strawberries, graham crackers, <br/>
angel cake, and banana chunks. Both on the table at the same time <br/>
(actually, the chocolate was there first, the cheese took a bit more <br/>
work to get the consistency right). DS (almost 8, not a &#39;grown up&#39; <br/>
by any stretch) had a few marshmallows covered in chocolate. Then <br/>
the cheese fondue hit the table and he alternated randomly between <br/>
the two and probably ate as much of the cheese fondue as I did.<br/>
 <br/>

&gt;limitations does<br/>
&gt; not mean we don&#39;t inform our children about things. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>When DS was about 5 (maybe a little younger), we noted a connection <br/>
between his protein intake (food in general, especially proteins) <br/>
and his behavior. He&#39;d get to doing something he -knew- was <br/>
irritating, potentially hazardous, etc and when requested to stop, <br/>
he&#39;d say &quot;my brain won&#39;t let me stop&quot; or something similar. His <br/>
tolerance for frustration would plummet and meltdowns would occur. <br/>
When the connection clicked in my head I said &quot;Hey how about we go <br/>
get a PBJ and talk about this. Would you like grape or strawberry <br/>
jam?&quot; (or something to that effect) and when he was munching I told <br/>
him I noticed that if he had some protein regularly (not a whole lot <br/>
even necessarily - a tbl of PB, a slice or two of cheese, whatever), <br/>
he didn&#39;t get so frustrated as easily. Now he&#39;s so used to it, he <br/>
almost doesn&#39;t think twice about just going and finding food when he <br/>
starts feeling that &#39;oddness&#39;. And, we continue to offer or just <br/>
have available for him (like making some crackers and cheese to take <br/>
to him while he&#39;s playing a video game) various foods - just because <br/>
he understands it doesn&#39;t mean we don&#39;t continue to help and be <br/>
available for him. He is also in on/overhearing our discussions <br/>
related to things like DH&#39;s hypertension - sodium, potassium, <br/>
cholesterol, etc. He&#39;s probably more conscientious about checking <br/>
labels than I am. One time, he was maybe 5ish, we had picked up a <br/>
pizza to take home and we stopped to pick up some soda to go with it <br/>
(don&#39;t know about you but pizza needs carbonated beverages). DS <br/>
stood looking at the selection and then picked up the Sprite and <br/>
read the sodium level. Then he picked up the root beer and checked <br/>
the sodium level. And chose the one with less sodium because &quot;this <br/>
is better for Daddy&#39;s blood pressure&quot;. The cashier at the mini-mart <br/>
(who was close enough to hear the whole thing) got a kick out of his <br/>
choosing. We talk (not teach not lecture but discuss as it arises) <br/>
about things like HFCS, what &#39;organic&#39; means, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What age did you start<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;trusting your children to experience food&quot;.  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>The day he was born and began nursing on demand. Really. His only <br/>
limits were set by real life things - like when we ran out of <br/>
oranges or Cheerios. Those items would wait until the next grocery <br/>
trip. A limit set not by us as far as &quot;we have 6 oranges but you can <br/>
only have two today&quot; but rather the reality of sometimes all the <br/>
oranges are gone and pay day is Friday and we&#39;ll get more then. Oh, <br/>
and he had input from the time he could talk and point as to what we <br/>
bought. From early on, we&#39;d discuss having to choose between A and B <br/>
because of our food money. By age 4 or 5 we&#39;d go to the market <br/>
together and he&#39;d choose between things as necessary (if we were <br/>
coming in low on the budget he could get A and B but if it was <br/>
getting tight he could get A or B - his choice). Sometimes his <br/>
choices were between pudding and cupcakes. Sometimes his choices <br/>
were between cupcakes and cottage cheese. As we shopped, I&#39;d note <br/>
things he asked for that weren&#39;t already accounted for on the list - <br/>
item, price, aisle. Once we were done with the basic shopping, I&#39;d <br/>
have a rough running total of the cost and I&#39;d let him know what the <br/>
budget could handle. We&#39;d go over his list and figure out his <br/>
options.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>As far as health issues, one thing I want to note is the difference <br/>
between current, existing health issues (nut allergy for example) <br/>
and &quot;potential&quot; health issues which may or may not arise. Limiting <br/>
on the &quot;odds&quot; and operating from fear of this or that is limiting <br/>
indeed - for everyone. Information and support rather than <br/>
externally imposed limits allows a person to seek their own -safe- <br/>
path rather than seeking to get around the limits. What looks like a <br/>
safe path to you might not be the best path for your offspring - you <br/>
might for your own self need to limit how much purple corn you eat <br/>
but your offspring can eat more purple corn safely than you can. <br/>
Should your limits apply to them? <br/>
