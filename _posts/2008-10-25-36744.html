<div id="ygrps-yiv-2005080658">Joyce and I have both mentioned conferences recently.<br/>

<br/>
I can&#39;t tell you how helpful they can be in actually SEEING it live, in action---and for convincing spouses.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Years ago when I started the Live and Learn Unschooling Conference, it was the &quot;only game in town.&quot; People came from all over the country, Canada, Europe, Mexico, and Australia. Now, there&#39;s something almost ever six weeks or so. Either full-blown conferences, gatherings, Non-Cons (non-conferences), or parties. No joke! Something every month.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For example:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Last weekend, my family went to GA to visit friends. We&#39;re in TN for ARGH! next weekend. We go to Atlanta again (for Mannheim Steamroller) in Nov. Everyone&#39;s invited to SC (my house---Danny Schmidt house concert) in Dec. We&#39;re celebrating again at my house in SC in Jan ---Cameron&#39;s 21 birthday party!. Hundreds of families will be in OH at the Waterpark Gathering in Feb. And that&#39;s all BEFORE the conference &quot;seasons&quot; in the spring and fall. Oh---and my family is missing a Non-Con in the NW next weekend as well as the Costa Rica conference in Dec.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s still room in Costa Rica. Contact Sharon at Pura Vida. There&#39;s still a cabin available at ARGH! in TN Nov 2-4. Ask Ren. Anyone&#39;s invited to my house for the Danny House Concert Dec 20. And we&#39;d LOVE a houseful for Cameron&#39;s birthday Jan 23-25. PLENTY of rooms left at the Waterpark Gathering Feb 2-7---contact Carol or Kimberly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Coming up we have:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ARGH! in TN<br/>
<br/>
The Pura Vida Conference in Costa Rica<br/>
<br/>
The WaterPark Gathering in Ohio<br/>
<br/>
The Great Big Happy Life Conference in NJ<br/>

<br/>
I could be missing one or two. If you know of others I&#39;ve missed or forgotten, please add them!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
These are all spin-offs of Live and Learn or of each other.<br/>

In addition, Arizona, California, and Illinois also have *very* unschooly-friendly homeschooling conferences. NC has their FLT gatherings. Non-Cons are springing up all over the place. <br/>

An easy way to keep up with conferences across the country is to join the <br/>
Unschooling Circuit Riders yahoogroup. You&#39;ll get an email every two weeks with <br/>
dates and links to the websites of every upcoming unschooling conference <br/>
opportunity (well, every one known to the list mama, anyway). <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a VERY low traffic list, just conference announcements and the regular <br/>
upcoming listing.<br/>
<br/>
And conference planners, if you send me information on your con as you know <br/>
it, I&#39;ll make sure it gets publicity on the Circuit Riders list.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and didn&#39;t want to get a lot of you&#39;re a bad parent advice.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve never seen anyone tell someone on one of these lists they&#39;re a  <br/>
bad parent. One sign of a good parent is recognizing where things  <br/>
aren&#39;t going right and asking for help. A bad parent is selfish and  <br/>
doesn&#39;t care. Anyone asking questions here obviously cares!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Can I politely ask her to pick up her wrapper off the<br/>
&gt; floor?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Of course.<br/>
<br/>
Unless you mean &quot;politely&quot; as most conventional parents mean, when it  <br/>
isn&#39;t a real question: saying &quot;Would you please?&quot; in a nice voice  <br/>
when they really mean &quot;Pick that up.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ask means one acceptable answer is no.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She throws clothing everywhere, wrappers, leaves plates etc<br/>
&gt; everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My 17 yo can do that too. It&#39;s totally unconscious. Her mind is  <br/>
elsewhere when she does it.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re there, say &quot;Wrapper.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
More trash cans around.<br/>
<br/>
Hampers in the areas she&#39;s most likely to take off clothes.<br/>
<br/>
What about one of those long reach grabbers? That would make it  <br/>
easier for you to pick up when you need to. (And I bet she&#39;d like to  <br/>
use it too ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I would have said I need you to help Mommy<br/>
&gt; there&#39;s lots of stuff on the floor.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My daughter has a hard time seeing what needs picked up too. I  <br/>
rephrased it as &quot;I&#39;d like to be able to vaccuum.&quot; That translated to  <br/>
something she understood.<br/>
<br/>
Being respectful doesn&#39;t mean never asking. If you and a guest were  <br/>
up and you were gathering dishes, would you hesitate to say &quot;Hey, can  <br/>
you grab that dish for me?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When we retain ownership of the task, we will ask differently than  <br/>
when we&#39;re trying to get someone else to see where they&#39;re falling  <br/>
short. When we ask knowing they can say no, our tone is different.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-926606813">Thank you Joyce,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My husband and I have always given Faith choices.  I have always insisted<br/>
Faith chose her own food or be actively involved in the dinner menu.  We<br/>
have always had unlimited candy around and because we do so, it is rarely<br/>
touched.  My sister feels we have created a very spoiled child, very self<br/>
centered.  A friend actually told me that she thinks Faith should go to<br/>
school as she thinks the world revolves around her.  I told her she needed<br/>
to understand, our world does revolve around Faith&#39;s needs and wants.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
She is an only child and I think it is natural for that to happen.  Last<br/>
night I watched the 3 year old across the street.  We went over to her house<br/>
as it was easier for when she fell asleep.  My DD was very happy about the<br/>
whole thing, until Sarah climbed on me and didn&#39;t want to share my lap and<br/>
fell asleep.  Then she made it clear she didn&#39;t like it when another child<br/>
was on my lap.  We have been discussing adopting another child and I told<br/>
her if that happened there would be occasions where I would need to hold the<br/>
other child and maybe not her could, how would she feel.  Last night she<br/>
said she didn&#39;t want another child, she only wants my attention.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I personally feel she has the biggest right of all to say yes or no to<br/>
another sibling.  She is the one who is going to have to share her Daddy and<br/>
me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Perhaps by insisted you mean &quot;stood firmly by your resolve to provide&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
If in your thoughts you&#39;re labeling what you do &quot;insisting&quot; by  <br/>
putting it the &quot;insisting&quot; box you can end up treating it like  <br/>
something to be insisted on. Just something to think about.<br/>
<br/>
Not all kids like a lot of choices. It can be overwhelming. They&#39;d  <br/>
much rather hear &quot;Do you want a hot dog or hamburger?&quot; knowing that  <br/>
neither is also a choice, than to hear &quot;Have any of the dozen choices  <br/>
you want.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That might not be your daughter, but it might apply to someone else  <br/>
who is reading.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I told her she needed<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Many parents come to radical unschooling with having had their needs  <br/>
set aside for their parents &quot;more important&quot; needs. The arrive with  <br/>
the vague question of &quot;When *is* it my turn?&quot; as they try to grasp  <br/>
what they want by doing what their parents did to them: trivializing  <br/>
their kids needs to get their own needs met.<br/>
<br/>
This may not be what you mean, but I do know it&#39;s a point of  <br/>
confusion for a lot of new unschoolers. It&#39;s helpful for kids to see  <br/>
us working to get our own needs met. This can be hard because we *do*  <br/>
need to set aside a lot of what we want in order to help our kids get  <br/>
what they want and need. But no one should be thinking a child who is  <br/>
asking for a banana at 10PM means mom drives to the grocery store at  <br/>
that hour! Hey, it could be a fun adventure if you feel like it :-)  <br/>
but it&#39;s not the only choice. You can say &quot;Let&#39;s put that down on the  <br/>
shopping list and make a run to the store in the morning. Let&#39;s see  <br/>
if we can find a substitute that will work until then.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The key is balance. Let them know their wants and needs are being  <br/>
taken serious and you have every intention of helping them. But do  <br/>
let them see treating your own needs seriously too. Seeing others as  <br/>
important is as important to model as seeing ourselves as important.  <br/>
But it takes a lot of self examination to figure out where meeting  <br/>
our needs is imposing on them.<br/>
