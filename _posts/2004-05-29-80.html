<div id="ygrps-yiv-1107523667">Just a quick note to let you all know that moonwindstarsky has links <br/>
to her site bookmarked in our &quot;links&quot; section of this site.<br/>
For those that haven&#39;t visited her site, it&#39;s one of the most <br/>
comprehensive I&#39;ve EVER seen on the topic of unschooling. You can <br/>
find her here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/moonwindstarsky/unschooling">http://www.geocities.com/moonwindstarsky/unschooling</a> <br/>
<br/>
And just to let ya know &quot;moon&quot;, I moved your bookmarks around and <br/>
rearranged a bit. They&#39;re now in folders, so we can add other links <br/>
under each heading. I kept your titles though, I thought they were <br/>
good. Thanks for putting those here.<br/>
<br/>
