reading, eating, playing time is just a totally blind experiment to  <br/>
see if it will work ;-)<br/>
<br/>
But, yes, when my daughter was in the 10-11 year range she watched *a  <br/>
lot* of TV. (Which unschoolers will say happens quite often in the  <br/>
preteen years.) Now it&#39;s hard enough to get her to watch what we have  <br/>
on the TiVo to clear it off. Programs she *wants* to watch but just  <br/>
has too many other things to do. We also have 3 (it was 5 but 2 died)  <br/>
game systems (not including the hand helds) but other than Dance  <br/>
Dance Revolution, they&#39;re rarely on.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, it is hard to believe. It *does* make more sense that when given  <br/>
free rein that kids will do nothing but watch junk TV, eat junk food,  <br/>
play video games. It&#39;s what everyone says will happen. It&#39;s what  <br/>
controlled kids do on weekends as soon as they can.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that allowing kids full rein of<br/>

&gt; self-control.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>At one time I would have said kids will learn self control but I was  <br/>
meaning something different by the term. So now I say that&#39;s a false  <br/>
goal. Self control suggests that the child will always want to play  <br/>
all day but will decide to limit themselves to 1 or 2 or 5 hours of  <br/>
play and turn it off after that amount of time.<br/>
<br/>
No, what happens is that they play to their limit. The limit might be  <br/>
how much time they have to play (before a play date or going  <br/>
shopping) or the limit might be how long they feel like playing. What  <br/>
they learn is not self control but to listen to the inner voice of   <br/>
how much they feel like playing.<br/>
<br/>
But to parents of children with limits &quot;as long as they feel like it&quot;  <br/>
*sounds* like all day everyday. Parents may even have experienced all  <br/>
day gaming sessions when they&#39;ve relaxed the rules so they &quot;know&quot; if  <br/>
there were no rules that that is exactly what their kids will do.<br/>
<br/>
But what those parents have experienced is what their *controlled*  <br/>
kids are like. They know what their *controlled* kids do when the  <br/>
rules are relaxed.<br/>
<br/>
Kids who have freedom are totally different creatures than controlled  <br/>
kids who are given moments of freedom. The difference is as stark as  <br/>
a school group of a field trip to the museum and a family on a visit  <br/>
the kids have planned.<br/>
<br/>
For parents who have dropped the rules entirely so that the kids have  <br/>
gained the confidence that the rules won&#39;t come back, &quot;as much as  <br/>
they want to&quot; *isn&#39;t* all day everyday. It might be all day initially  <br/>
when the kids are trying to catch up on all the gaming they&#39;ve been  <br/>
denied. It might be initially while the kids try to cram as much  <br/>
gaming in as they can before the limits return. But once the kids  <br/>
know they can turn off the game (or TV or computer) and come back to  <br/>
it any time they want, they aren&#39;t playing desperately any more.  <br/>
They&#39;re playing because they want to in that moment.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
there&#39;s lots more on video games and TV. It&#39;s probably one of the  <br/>
most frequent topics here! (Though my forte is helping people see why  <br/>
they think their beliefs are true and why those beliefs aren&#39;t true.  <br/>
Other people here are good at explaining the practical  <br/>
implementation: what to do instead of what they&#39;re doing now.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I sold our n64 because the boys were constantly fighting about  <br/>
&gt; using it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And when you step back and look at the problem solving technique you  <br/>
modeled for them, you&#39;ve told them through your actions that when  <br/>
someone is doing something you don&#39;t like, it&#39;s perfectly okay to  <br/>
steal something of theirs. It&#39;s perfectly okay to ignore their  <br/>
feelings because your feelings are more important. You&#39;ve shown them  <br/>
with your actions that fighting is an insolvable problem and even  <br/>
with your 20 plus years on the planet you have no clue on how to  <br/>
resolve conflicts. So the best method you&#39;ve come up with is to be  <br/>
bigger and stronger and make someone do what you want them to do.<br/>
<br/>
*Is* that the model you want to give your kids?<br/>
<br/>
If you ask, mindful parents here can offer ways they&#39;ve respectfully  <br/>
resolved conflicts between their kids.<br/>
<br/>
I think one of the traps that most parents fall into is they turn  <br/>
their kids into the problem. Rather than focusing on ways to help  <br/>
resolve the problem, they make the problem go away. It&#39;s lots easier!  <br/>
It solves a momentary problem but what they don&#39;t see are the  <br/>
consequences of momentary solutions. It&#39;s like sticking a rock in  <br/>
each leak in the dike without being able to see the dike itself or  <br/>
what&#39;s building behind it.<br/>
<br/>
I think if you were to poll conventional parents to see how they rate  <br/>
their relationship with their teens and what they think of their  <br/>
teens as human beings, it would be pretty dismal.<br/>
<br/>
I think if you were to poll unschooling, mindful parents to see how  <br/>
they rate their relationships with their teens and what they think of  <br/>
their teens as human beings, it would be pretty high! (And if you go  <br/>
to an unschooling conference you&#39;d see it with your own eyes.)<br/>
<br/>
*That&#39;s* the difference helping them versus controlling them makes.  <br/>
Helping them be who they are versus shaping them into who we think  <br/>
they should be.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It didn&#39;t help that the oldest has a competitive streak in him and I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t really want to encourage (it was learned, not ingrained, I  <br/>
&gt; think).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Our kids are who they are. Unschooling and mindful parenting doesn&#39;t  <br/>
work with just &quot;nice&quot; kids. In fact it works far better than anything  <br/>
else with kids who would be labeled by others.<br/>
<br/>
Whether learned or nature, preventing competition doesn&#39;t help him  <br/>
develop the skills to handle the feelings he has inside. It just  <br/>
drives the need for competition inside where you can&#39;t see it. If  <br/>
you&#39;ve shown them that overt competition where you can see it is  <br/>
something that will result in some kind of punishment, what you&#39;re  <br/>
teaching him is to be sneaky about it. He&#39;s going to compete when  <br/>
he&#39;s out of your sight. And he won&#39;t have anyone to help him work on  <br/>
developing better skills. What could happen -- what you&#39;ve  <br/>
demonstrated is the best method you&#39;ve found -- is that being bigger  <br/>
and stronger is the best way to get what you want.<br/>
<br/>
There are plenty of parents here who have competitive children. If  <br/>
you ask, they&#39;ll pass on respectful ways they&#39;ve helped their  <br/>
children get what they want without tearing someone down.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1686647686">Self control was never the issue or goal. At least not in the way I think<br/>
you mean it. In our house we have unlimited tv, computers and game systems.<br/>
I think we have 4 tvs, 4 or 5 game systems and 4 computers. We have had<br/>
unlimited access for at least 6 or 7 years now and we&#39;re heading in that<br/>
direction for a few years before that. I think I can safely say I have &quot;seen<br/>
the end result of it&quot;.  Yes, they watched a lot tv at first, at least the<br/>
older kids did since they had more limits when they were younger.<br/>
Interestingly enough, my youngest who was raised with the fewest limits<br/>
probably watched less tv then the older kids did when they were younger.<br/>
Now I probably watch more tv than the kids do. We have our shows we like to<br/>
watch together.  But it&#39;s really not something I even think about much now.<br/>
We lead a busy life. The older kids have jobs, we&#39;re involved in 4-H, we<br/>
have some homeschool activities we do, my youngest does Odyssey of the Mind,<br/>
Karl has choir, the boys and I do church. TV just isn&#39;t the center of their<br/>
world. It&#39;s there and used a lot, but it&#39;s just one of the many things we<br/>
do. My youngest spends hours a day right now doing some RPG games on-line.<br/>
Building characters, worlds, doing research for both. He loves it. Gaming<br/>
comes and goes. My 16 year old is saving for an x-box 360 so when we get<br/>
that, I&#39;m sure there will be lots of playing for a while.  One way we<br/>
eliminated the fighting was to be sure there were plenty of computers,  game<br/>
systems, controllers, games and tvs for everyone.  We get them used at the<br/>
local game store. TVs are cheap at our local Salvation Army store. Games can<br/>
be rented. The other issue of the value of these things....I&#39;ve stopped<br/>
looking for &quot;educational value&quot; in what my kids do, I&#39;m quite convinced they<br/>
learn all the time.  I know what my kids have learned. (my youngest learned<br/>
to read and type playing Rune Scape). If I were to try to explain all that<br/>
my kids have learned from games, tv, the computer....sheesh, I&#39;d be here for<br/>
an hour....but alas, work calls...so suffice it to say that my kids are<br/>
competent. They have jobs in the world, they can hold their own and they are<br/>
happy and content.<br/>

<br/>
I have been reading with interest all the comments about video games <br/>
but<br/>
I still find it hard to believe that allowing kids full rein of<br/>
electronics for months on end will actually help them learn<br/>
self-control.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that they learn &quot;self-control.&quot; They learn that they are <br/>
trusted and respected by their parents. They learn adundance---that <br/>
they can have all they want and never feel deprived. When those needs <br/>
are *met*, they don&#39;t feel the deprivation and scarcity of limitations, <br/>
so they will be open to do *other* things. But until that need is met, <br/>
thay will gorge at any and every possible moment.<br/>
<br/>
Putting a time limit on *how long* you will lift the limits won&#39;t help. <br/>
If you say (even just to yourself!), &quot;I&#39;ll give them unlimited access <br/>
to these games for a month,&quot;---they&#39;ll see right through that. Even a <br/>
year! They&#39;ll know you&#39;re not really serious, and at the end of that <br/>
time, they will be just as involved as ever. The *worst* thing to do is <br/>
to waffle between lifting limits and settng them again and again---you <br/>
lose that trust that is so desperately needed.<br/>
<br/>
The trick is to raise the limits indefinitely, join them in their love <br/>
of the games, help them when they&#39;re strugglilng, play WITH them, and <br/>
believe that these are fabulous learning tools! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As adults, WE ALL have the means and opportunity to do whatever we want <br/>
whenever we want. Why don&#39;t we just do *that* (fill in your obsession <br/>
of choice! &lt;G&gt;)? Is it because someone else has imposed limits? Or is <br/>
it because we choose what is important at this moment?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Is there anyone that has seen the end result of it?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I have a 19 year old and an 11 year old. The 19 year old was never <br/>
really into gaming (but he watched a LOT of TV and played on the <br/>
computer for hours & hours each day while deschooling!), but he&#39;s been <br/>
immersed in other things for extended times: Magic, skateboarding, <br/>
filming, drumming, cooking---to the exclusion of almost all other <br/>
things. That&#39;s the way he learns best---total immersion. It seems <br/>
obsessive, but as son as he&#39;s mastered it to the point he&#39;s satisfied, <br/>
he moves on---but not without all the knowledge he&#39;s gained from each <br/>
immersion. Then he touches each in a cennected way with the others.<br/>
<br/>
My 11 year old is a BIG gamer. Unlimited. Some days, he&#39;s on the games <br/>
the entire day. It&#39;s what he loves. But because he *knows* he has <br/>
unlimited access here, he&#39;s perfectly happy to do other things. Getting <br/>
him to help me or go out with me is easy because he knows I support his <br/>
passion. Some of his schooled/limited friends refuse to do anything <br/>
while they have their few hours of gaming each week. They rush through <br/>
their chores, they rush through their homework, they rush through their <br/>
meals to that they can have the precious little time on the games <br/>
that&#39;s allowed after all the other requirements are met. When they are <br/>
nere, all they want to do is to game. Duncan tries to get them to swim <br/>
or play outside, but they only have eyes for the game systems.<br/>
<br/>
The end result is that they *know* that their passion will be fed, so <br/>
they are willing to use their time for other things too. Including <br/>
reading. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I sold our n64 because the boys were constantly fighting about using <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
So what was the lesson learned there? Might is right?<br/>
<br/>
Was it financially possible to buy another Nintendo64? and another few <br/>
games? Wouldn&#39;t that have also solved the problem?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
It didn&#39;t help that the oldest has a competitive streak in him and I<br/>
don&#39;t really want to encourage (it was learned, not ingrained, I <br/>
think).<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Hard to say---nurture vs nature. But better to learn to deal with the <br/>
feelings than suppress them (daughter of a shrink here! &lt;G&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
We have no TV or games, only Macs and videophones. Sometimes we play<br/>
free games online like bigfishgames.com, hotwheels.com or lego.com. <br/>
I&#39;ve<br/>

<br/>
Why no TV or games?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-95992920">I&#39;m still reading all of your responses, but I&#39;m not finished --<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the full story about the n64. We were living with my parents <br/>
because I had separated from my husband (power and control issues, might <br/>
is right, etc.). My uncle gave the boys a n64, loaded with games.  He&#39;d <br/>
play a lot and my mother, who refused to buy video games while I was <br/>
growing up, would keep nudging me about it.  The younger twins wanted to <br/>
play too, and they&#39;d squabble over it. I tried several solutions but in <br/>
the end I just felt bothered over the whole thing. So I talked with Jael <br/>
about it and said, you guys fight over it so much, I don&#39;t like that.  <br/>
Some of the games have fighting and competition in it and I don&#39;t <br/>
support that. (See aforemented products of the abusive marriage.) What <br/>
do you think? I suggest selling the N64. The money you get for it, you <br/>
can buy something else with it.  We talked over it and he agreed with <br/>
selling it. So we sold it and he had the money to buy another toy that <br/>
he wanted.  I think they all bought Transformers with it.  Not a perfect <br/>
situation but I tried.<br/>
<br/>
The good thing is that my husband went to counseling and that cycle <br/>
seems to be done with. But I do struggle with what I was raised with and <br/>
what I was exposed to.  I talk with my kids a lot more than before, and <br/>
try to use the principles of positive parenting.  I want them to grow <br/>
into responsible adults and I have been giving them more decisions, etc. <br/>
It is a process for all of us.<br/>
<br/>
As to why we don&#39;t have more than one system, TV, etc.  I can&#39;t afford <br/>
cable, nor can I afford $200 systems. My income is so low I&#39;d feel <br/>
guilty buying those things. We have broadband internet because I&#39;m Deaf, <br/>
an ASL signer, and the VP is used for Video Relay and calling other Deaf <br/>
friends. The Macs are from my freelance designer days. We make do with <br/>
what we got. I&#39;m especially thankful that despite my income I still can <br/>
stay at home with the boys.<br/>

<br/>
I still find it hard to believe that controlling how much kids play,<br/>
when they can play, and which games they play will actually help them<br/>
learn self-control. Is there anyone that has seen the end result of it?<br/>
<br/>
Not to be snarky, but... how can *you* controlling someone else teach<br/>
them *self*-control? I was &quot;disciplined&quot; as a child - meaning someone<br/>
else controlled my actions (around them, anyway) through coercion and<br/>
punishment. I did *not* learn self-discipline. I learned distrust of<br/>
and alienation from that parent. Perhaps most harmful, distrust of my<br/>
own inner voice. It has taken years (and years and years) to regain<br/>
that. &quot;The end result&quot; of not limiting games, TV, etc. is that my kids<br/>
are learning to listen to *their own* inner guidance about how much is<br/>
&quot;too much&quot;. They are learning what *they* enjoy, not what I think they<br/>
should enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
And the end result, for me, is not that ultimately they&#39;ll watch or<br/>
play less. It used to be, before I really understood unschooling. (and<br/>
when I still demonized TV) I used to think &quot;OK, if I &quot;let them&quot; watch<br/>
all they want, eventually they&#39;ll tire of it and move on.&quot; Now, the<br/>
phrase &quot;let them&quot; seems foreign to me, and I have the attitude of<br/>
hoping what they&#39;re doing is bringing them joy, whether that&#39;s<br/>
watching TV, gaming, building a Lego city, or playing outdoors.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a bit difficult to explain how that shift occurred, but the word<br/>
&quot;allowing&quot; comes to mind. I let go, then let go some more, and in the<br/>
process discovered a deeper connection with my kids than I knew was<br/>
possible... and because of the inner work involved, a deeper<br/>
connection with myself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-686009536"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Is there anyone that has seen the end result of it?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have and I have only been doing this for a few short weeks. My son <br/>
(12yo) was a total addict when it came to video games. He spent every <br/>
waking moment that he could playing them, and nothing else would exist <br/>
except as a deterrent to playing his beloved games. He came home from <br/>
school, plowed through his homework without taking a bit of it in, and <br/>
did whatever else was necessary to get to his games. I tried to limit <br/>
him as much as possible, but finally gave in realizing it was something <br/>
that was very important to him.<br/>
<br/>
Then we decided to homeschool, and in the process found unschooling. I <br/>
wrote here about it not long ago, and it hit me that his one ambition is <br/>
becoming a computer programmer and creating video games when he gets <br/>
older, and that is something that is deeply important to him, just like <br/>
it was to me when I was growing up to stay up late at night learning to <br/>
draw (I&#39;m an artist professionally now). By limiting him on his video <br/>
games, I was keeping him from his one love.<br/>
<br/>
I told him he was allowed to play them as much as he wanted to. If he <br/>
wanted to stay up late at night he could, if it was important to him. I <br/>
even told him I was wrong and related the story of my own youth when I <br/>
was fussed out by my mother for staying up all night on a school night <br/>
because I was trying to learn how to draw horses. Then something amazing <br/>
happened...<br/>
<br/>
My son didn&#39;t seem to be as interested in playing his games anymore. He <br/>
still plays them, but not to the extent he did before. If he gets a new <br/>
game, he will play it for several days straight until he gets to a point <br/>
where he burns out on it, or beats the game, but it isn&#39;t his whole <br/>
focus anymore. He has spent more time outside than ever before, has <br/>
started using an anvil and scrap copper that my hubby brings in off the <br/>
job (he&#39;s a plumber) and has started making jewelry (see the necklace he <br/>
made me! <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://deschoolingcaleb.blogspot.com/">http://deschoolingcaleb.blogspot.com/</a> ) and has become highly <br/>
interested in blacksmithing now. He also has taken a deep interest in <br/>
making yeast bread with me, and is currently learning to sew.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, he may still spend as much time on the computer as he once <br/>
did once you take into account he is no longer spending hours upon hours <br/>
in school and doing homework, but for the most part the addiction like <br/>
behavior is no longer there. He WANTS to do other things, learn other <br/>
things and explore areas he never really showed an interest in before. <br/>
He has (on his own) decided to stop watching as many cartoons and <br/>
started watching other programs like Myth Busters, and Dirty Jobs and <br/>
loves watching animal planet.<br/>
<br/>
He has shocked me with the things he has learned without my help at all. <br/>
He told me that pigeon poop can carry up to 60 different diseases, <br/>
during a conversation I was having with my daughter about birds. He <br/>
comes up with things I never thought he would pick up, but he has been <br/>
picking things up and RETAINING the information! If he had been forced <br/>
to remember those tidbits for a test in school, he would never have <br/>
remembered it simply because he was so intent on getting to his games in <br/>
the little spare time he had.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t speak to every child out there, but my 12 year old son <br/>
definitely has benefited from being allowed to play as many video games <br/>
as he wanted and when he wanted. He did for a few weeks stay on WOW <br/>
pretty constantly, but now he has branched out and has explored many new <br/>
things that otherwise I NEVER could have forced him into in lieu of <br/>
video games, he had to do that himself.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t have no hand in this of course, I helped him in every way I <br/>
could to be bale to explore things that interested him. He tried banging <br/>
some copper on an anvil and I went out and bought him some new tools and <br/>
made sure he had plenty of materials and encouragement. He took an <br/>
interest in baking breads and I looked up recipes and bought the <br/>
necessary supplies. He took an interest in sewing and I went out and got <br/>
a few patterns he liked and we are now working on sewing him some new <br/>
clothes. I gave him the opportunities to do something other than video <br/>
games, but never forced or coerced him into doing something else, or <br/>
forced him away from the video games at all. He did that all on his own!<br/>
<br/>
We still have great fun sometimes curling up and playing video games <br/>
together, and he has started earning some money on his own to purchase <br/>
some of the games he really wants, but it didn&#39;t become an all inclusive <br/>
thing once he had free rein, it took a back burner to learning other <br/>
things, and I have done all in my power to give him that opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
It works. I&#39;m a believer!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>For me, the comment I have found most helpful in this regard is to <br/>
consider your childrens&#39; issues, requests, etc. in the same way you <br/>
would your partners. In other words, if there was something that you <br/>
and your partner had to share and both wanted to use at the same time <br/>
(say you both had favorite shows that aired at the same time and you <br/>
wanted to watch them at the time they aired), you&#39;d probably buy <br/>
another TV.<br/>
<br/>
And the same applies to food choices. Truthfully, have you or your <br/>
partner ever had a cookie or some chocolate or whatever just before <br/>
dinner? But what do parents usually say if a child wants to do the <br/>
same?<br/>
<br/>
In short, I always try the, what-if-it-was-me-or-my-partner analogy <br/>
before I jump in with rules or decisions.<br/>

you&#39;re doing. You did the best you could with what knowledge you had  <br/>
at the time. It&#39;s all any of us ever can do.<br/>
<br/>
Our &quot;job&quot; here on the list is to help people who&#39;ve come to get a  <br/>
better understanding of unschooling, understand the principles so  <br/>
they can apply them to their lives. Our &quot;job&quot; is to help the people  <br/>
who want to stay focused on where they want to be, stay focused  on  <br/>
where they want to be.<br/>
<br/>
Even those of us who understand the principles do hurtful things  <br/>
sometimes. We screw up. But we have a clear vision of the parent we  <br/>
want to be. We have a resource of other parents with similar visions  <br/>
on whose wisdom we can draw so we can get ourselves back on track if  <br/>
we can&#39;t figure out why things went wrong.<br/>
<br/>
I think the biggest difference between the people who &quot;get&quot; why the  <br/>
list concentrates on explaining the ideas and not on support is that  <br/>
some people accept that this is a long process which they can&#39;t get  <br/>
right right away so the goal is to study what&#39;s working and not  <br/>
working and strive to be better, and some people (most people in our  <br/>
society I think!) are stuck with the school idea that there&#39;s one  <br/>
right answer and if you don&#39;t have that one right answer then you&#39;re  <br/>
wrong and bad so they need their spirits lifted to feel good about  <br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re *all* going to make wrong choices. We&#39;re *all* going to get  <br/>
stuck in old style thinking. It&#39;s just part of the process.<br/>
<br/>
The goal isn&#39;t to be right. The short term goal is to accept being  <br/>
human and try to figure out how to make the next moment or next time  <br/>
go better.<br/>
<br/>
The long term goal is to treat our children with the respect we would  <br/>
fellow human beings (even when they haven&#39;t figured out how to be  <br/>
respectful human beings yet!)<br/>

joyful lives in their family and building relationships with their  <br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
Our values are our own. When we use those values to control others,  <br/>
we not only whittle away at our relationship with them but we lessen  <br/>
others vision of our values.<br/>
<br/>
If my husband didn&#39;t want to eat refined sugar,<br/>

If you don&#39;t like fighting and competition games, then you shouldn&#39;t  <br/>
play them. Preventing others from playing them is using power over  <br/>
another to get them to do what you want them to do -- just as is done  <br/>
in fighting!<br/>
<br/>
While what you did at the time may have been a far better solution  <br/>
than the abuse that was swirling around in your life, it may have  <br/>
been the best you could do in the place you were in at the time. But  <br/>
this list isn&#39;t for validation. We assume people are trying to do  <br/>
their best. The list is for examining situations to help people  <br/>
understand the principles so they can move themselves towards more  <br/>
joyful lives and better relationships.<br/>
<br/>
The situation with the N64 can either be let go as the best you could  <br/>
do with the knowledge you had at the time or examined in the light of  <br/>
new knowledge on what choices you could make now that would build  <br/>
relationships. (The situation is probably more useful for others  <br/>
reading in helping them understand the principles. You&#39;re too close  <br/>
to it to be able to see, your own vision is blocking what it looked  <br/>
and felt like through your children&#39;s eyes.)<br/>
<br/>

&gt; what I was exposed to.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We all do. We all have baggage. Some have more than others and self  <br/>
examination will be harder and more painful.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I talk with my kids a lot more than before, and<br/>
&gt; try to use the principles of positive parenting. I want them to grow<br/>
&gt; into responsible adults and I have been giving them more decisions,  <br/>
&gt; etc.<br/>
&gt; It is a process for all of us.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is. And don&#39;t beat yourself up when you screw up. Ask yourself how  <br/>
you can make the next moment better, what other *better* choices you  <br/>
have. Pam Sorooshian often suggests giving yourself two choices in a  <br/>
situation and then picking the better one. It may not be the elusive  <br/>
&quot;best&quot; but don&#39;t try to be perfect, just keep working toward the  <br/>
perfect vision. It&#39;s a journey but without that focus on where we  <br/>
want to be it&#39;s hard to get there! This list is all about helping  <br/>
people keep focused on getting better and better.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; As to why we don&#39;t have more than one system, TV, etc. I can&#39;t afford<br/>

&gt; guilty buying those things.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You aren&#39;t the only low income person here so there *is* wisdom from  <br/>
others who feel the tightness of purse strings. There are swaps and  <br/>
barters and trades. When we keep &quot;can&#39;t&quot; in our vocabulary we erect  <br/>
walls that we&#39;re certain are real and &quot;can&#39;t&quot; be gotten around. And  <br/>
often &quot;can&#39;t&quot; is a justification for denying a heartfelt need from a  <br/>
child that we think isn&#39;t important or is inconvenient for us. It&#39;s  <br/>
quite often a time for self examination. A better response is &quot;How  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-635448089">I wanted to share a story in relation to this topic, because when we  <br/>
say &quot;How can we...?&quot; we really open ourselves up to all the wonderful  <br/>
things in the universe that CAN happen. I have so many examples of  <br/>
this just from this past week, that I&#39;m giddy to share. Josh is a  <br/>
technophile, and it is hard to support that while supporting a family  <br/>
of nine. We&#39;ve gotten lucky, the local university often sells  <br/>
computers and monitors for $35 to $40, so we have been able to pick  <br/>
up several over the years. Josh has a computer, but really really  <br/>
wants a laptop. We had just watched the Secret, and Josh turned to me  <br/>
and said &quot;I&#39;m going to have a laptop by Christmas!&quot; I was thinking to  <br/>
myself, HOW?! But I didn&#39;t share that negativity with him...I just  <br/>
let it go through me. I tried to fret about the cost, the cheapest  <br/>
I&#39;ve seen is $600, and there was no way we could do that while  <br/>
maintaining our debt free lifestyle. So I prayed about it, he&#39;s been  <br/>
visualizing it, and we just got a phone call from a waiver program  <br/>
saying that they&#39;ve decided to offer computers (desktop and laptop)  <br/>
on the program. We signed our agreement that we&#39;d like one, and ETA  <br/>
is December 21st. Around the same time he decided that he wanted a  <br/>
PDA. I just affirmed it, saying &quot;I don&#39;t know how that will happen,  <br/>
that will be GREAT!&quot; Just something to help keep him on track with  <br/>
schedules and appointments, etc. Not just any PDA but a certain  <br/>
model, with all the cables, connectors, and a keyboard. Lo and  <br/>
behold, Friday night my dad stops by with a box from my brother.  <br/>
Inside is TWO PDA&#39;s, with all the connectors, manuals, and software  <br/>
to hook it up to his computer.<br/>
<br/>
Those are things that the universe has just dropped in our laps, let  <br/>
me share how Emily has worked on &quot;how can we make it happen?&quot; She  <br/>
really wanted a pair of heelies, and I told her that would be great,  <br/>
but I couldn&#39;t afford to buy them right now. So we tried to come up  <br/>
with some alternatives (ebay, knock-offs, etc) Well, one of her  <br/>
friend&#39;s dads overheard her saying that she was working on making  <br/>
that happen, and it just so happens that when he bought a pair for  <br/>
his daughter, he had bid on another and forgotten to cancel. So, he  <br/>
offered to sell them to us for what he paid, plus shipping. She had  <br/>
some cash, sold her rollerblades, and negotiated with him to help  <br/>
pull his tomato cages off of his rather large veggie garden to work  <br/>
off the rest. So she got a pair of heelies for $20 and three hours of  <br/>
labor.<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to share, that yes, cash can be tight, but there are so  <br/>
many options when you look at how you CAN do things, and be open to  <br/>
letting the universe deliver. It&#39;s been an amazing week!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-504136161">Even those of us who understand the principles do hurtful things <br/>
sometimes. We screw up. But we have a clear vision of the parent we <br/>
want to be. We have a resource of other parents with similar visions <br/>
on whose wisdom we can draw so we can get ourselves back on track if <br/>
we can&#39;t figure out why things went wrong<br/>
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
   <br/>
  I am one of those who have a clear vision of the parent I want to be and I totally get it but sometimes I don&#39;t react to my kids the way I want to. Those old tapes in your head ( I don&#39;t believe them) keep getting in the way when I am tired, hungry, frustrated, stressed. <br/>
  Its a process and I need this list `. I need the kick in the butt. I have even called Kelly Lovejoy ( Thank you so much Kelly) to get a &quot;kick&quot; when I was stuck being less than I want to be.<br/>
  Thank you to all this wonderful moms here. I couldn&#39;t possible name all of them.<br/>
  Thank you to the list owners.<br/>
  Thank you the friends I made at Live and Learn.<br/>
  Thank you to people who take their time writing about unschooling<br/>
  I have learned so much here and at AU.<br/>
  I have learned to be a better parent and spouse.<br/>

think he needs algebra <br/>
to be able to play that guitar fantastically.  What can 9th grade do <br/>
to help him become a better professional War Craft  player? &gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
My dh gets paid to watch tv. There&#39;s a lot more to what he does than  just <br/>
watch, but that really is a big part of his job.  So if his parents  would&#39;ve <br/>
told him when he was a kid, &quot;Nobody&#39;s going to pay you to watch tv&quot;  they <br/>
would&#39;ve been completely wrong.<br/>
 <br/>
I think it&#39;s interesting to look at what people do for a living,  and think <br/>
about what kinds of things they might have been (or could have  been but were <br/>
prevented from) doing as kids to &quot;prepare.&quot;<br/>

was uncomfortable. I pointed it out because going back to defend a  <br/>
past decision won&#39;t help *you*. It won&#39;t help you see the situation  <br/>
from your boy&#39;s points of view. It won&#39;t help you feel what it&#39;s like  <br/>
to have someone take something that belongs to you and make decisions  <br/>
about it &quot;for your own good&quot; and so they can feel better. So it&#39;s  <br/>
better to just set it aside and move onto something that will help.<br/>
<br/>
Ask yourself &quot;What do they want and how can I help them get it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(Though in our house a running joke is that the one cat we have that  <br/>
never seems quite satisfied with life is thinking &quot;What do I want and  <br/>
how can I get them to give it to me?&quot; ;-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>quest and avoid cooking things for him that had refined sugar.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;But if he decided the family couldn&#39;t keep Coke in the refrigerator, or<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that all of us needed to give up refined sugar, then that&#39;s control.<br/>
<br/>
For most people, I could make a reasonable case that I &quot;should&quot;<br/>
limit/control what comes into the house as far as sugary stuff goes - I<br/>
was diagnosed in January of this year with type 2 diabetes. So, for most<br/>
mainstream folks, that means I kick all of DS&#39; and DH&#39;s favorite &#39;sweet<br/>
things&#39; out of the house entirely (not to mention pasta, potatoes,<br/>
homemade bread, etc) because they&#39;re &#39;bad&#39; for me. Nope. Not happening.<br/>
It&#39;s my *choice* of what to eat. I can *choose* to get as much<br/>
nutritional bang for my carb buck. I can *choose* to have 3 snack size<br/>
Snickers bars. Some choices are better than others but they are my<br/>
choices, they are not mandates to be enforced on my family. That said, I<br/>
do ask for their help sometimes (hey guys, those Snickers bars are<br/>
calling me, can we put that bowl of candy someplace else for now?) and<br/>
since DH is the head chef at our house, he&#39;s getting really good at low<br/>
carb, low glycemic cooking that is tasty for everyone.<br/>

people do that on the computer, but I still like to get a brand new <br/>
box of crayons and just color to my heart&#39;s content. Ahhhhh.<br/>

My brother has managed to involve his teenage love of bicycle racing <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I was just thinking about this today...<br/>
<br/>
We have NO idea what the world will look like when our kids are older.<br/>
Thirty years ago, did anyone *know* there would be computers in many<br/>
homes? (Besides Steve Jobs, anyway) I remember when the dot-com bubble<br/>
was growing, a friend told me she now wished she had never told her<br/>
son to &quot;get off the computer and do something else!&quot; Back when<br/>
computer enthusiasts were seen as something extraordinary and geeky,<br/>
she wanted him to be &quot;normal&quot;. But the definition of what was normal<br/>
then has expanded and changed. I can&#39;t ask my kids to be &quot;my&quot; normal.<br/>
I never wanted to be normal, anyway, but *if* that were important to<br/>
me. lol Because who knows what their normal will be?<br/>
<br/>
I do believe that we&#39;re tapped into a larger consciousness, and<br/>
supporting our kids in their interests helps them stay connected to<br/>
that a little more. They&#39;ll be guided to *exactly* where they need to<br/>
be. Well - they *are* exactly where they need to be! lol Whether or<br/>
not I can translate what they&#39;re into as a future career. Professional<br/>
