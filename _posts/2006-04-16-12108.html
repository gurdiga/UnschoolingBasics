<div id="ygrps-yiv-496448640">As I work towards trusting and respecting my children more, I&#39;m noticing<br/>
little things about their behavior that I wouldn&#39;t have noticed before.<br/>
(Ah, awareness!)  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This lovely Easter morning, my older son woke up at 6am to see if the Easter<br/>
Bunny had paid us a visit.  The Bunny brought a massive variety of candies<br/>
(and a few toys) and it was all over the place.  Drew looked at it all,<br/>
thought it was great, opened all the eggs to see what was inside, etc.  He<br/>
came across an unfamiliar candy and I told him what it was (a Skittle) and<br/>
asked if he wanted to try one.  He answered, &quot;Mm.maybe after breakfast.&quot; and<br/>
then wanted to play Game Cube.  It&#39;s been about an hour since then and he<br/>
hasn&#39;t had a single bite of anything.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tried to give my kids pretty free reign (still working on this) about<br/>
food.  Candy isn&#39;t &quot;bad&quot;, it&#39;s just candy.  When Drew wants to have some of<br/>
his goodies today, he will.  But he&#39;s not like a shark in a feeding frenzy,<br/>
eating until he is sick and hoarding it away.  He&#39;ll eat it when he wants to<br/>
eat it, whenever that is.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My sister-in-law is very strict about foods with her kids.  Their Easter<br/>
Baskets this morning won&#39;t have any &quot;junk&quot; in it.  Later today we&#39;ll do an<br/>
egg hunt at my mother-in-law&#39;s house with eggs filled with typical candy.<br/>
My nephews will probably go crazy, stuffing as much candy in as they can<br/>
before their mother gets mad and makes them stop.  I wonder how much they<br/>
are even enjoying their treats, having the fear of their mom &quot;catching&quot; them<br/>
with it hanging over their heads as they sneak extra pieces behind her back.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The difference between the two scenarios?  My kids are allowed to eat when<br/>
they want to, so food isn&#39;t a magical treasure to be gorged on during<br/>
special times, with the fear that they won&#39;t have it again for many months<br/>
(until a birthday party or other holiday comes around).  It&#39;s just food.<br/>
Tasty and enjoyable to eat, but it&#39;ll be there in a hour, or a day, or next<br/>
month.  When they want to eat it, and will really enjoy eating it.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
That said, my 2yo isn&#39;t up yet, and I&#39;m sure he will want to eat candy until<br/>
we need to peel him off the walls.  He&#39;s in a big &quot;candy mode&quot; right now.<br/>
Which I&#39;m struggling with, honestly.  I know that totally contradicts what I<br/>
just said above, lol.  Let go, Shell...let go.. (everyone send me those<br/>
vibes please!)<br/>

I gave her an Easter basket this morning, she joked that it would <br/>
last her until Halloween.<br/>

Easter candy is cheap and nasty.&quot;  I guess they have gotten used to the<br/>
expensive fair trade chocolate that I buy at our local HFS that has a high<br/>
cocoa content.  I don&#39;t recall seeing any fair trade chocolate bunnies this<br/>
year at the HFS.<br/>

Yeah, my boys each got a(NOTHER!) stuffed bunny, a DVD, swim goggles, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1493272007">I think my kids just associate Easter with fun.  I hide little plastic eggs filled with a piece of candy or penny or whatever all over and they hunt for them. I know they really don&#39;t believe in the Easter Bunny at this point. They both built fairy houses yesterday in the backyard and my son asked if the fairies would leave him Easter candy in them this morning. I said I didn&#39;t know he&#39;d have to check in the morning. So first thing this morning he had to run out & look & of course there was candy in the fairy houses. I had fun just watching them search :)<br/>

  I always put other things in their baskets as well, but they associate the<br/>
basket with candy.  I guess by not having any wants the need for a basket is<br/>
sort of moot.<br/>

hunt.  (FWIW, I avoid Palmer &quot;chocolates&quot; -- think of them as chalk-<br/>
lates...)  When he was younger (maybe 7ish), he said it was his <br/>
favorite holiday because he got to practice division.  (We are <br/>
secular, so it isn&#39;t a religious holiday for us.)  He was still in <br/>
school at that point.  But he still loves the hunt, and asked to have <br/>
me hide them in harder places this year.  <br/>
