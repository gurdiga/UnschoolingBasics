<div id="ygrps-yiv-1311675369">This is what I found on Maine laws. I&#39;m a little confused.  Is it saying I can &quot;allow&quot; my kids to drink or can&#39;t I ?<br/>
<br/>
First one:<br/>
<br/>
Under 21<br/>
<br/>
Illegal Possession<br/>
<br/>
It is a civil violation for any person under the age of 21 to possess liquor or imitation liquor except if it is within the scope of their employment or in their home in the presence of their parent.  Fines for illegal possession are as follows:<br/>
<br/>
     1st Offense $100 to $300; <br/>
     2nd Offense $200 to $500; and <br/>
     3rd or Subsequent Offenses $500.<br/>
      Youths 17 years or younger are charged with the juvenile crime of illegal possession.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
      Second one:<br/>
      Over 21<br/>
<br/>
      Furnishing Liquor to a Minor<br/>
<br/>
      Any person who furnishes liquor to a minor, or allows a minor under that person&#39;s control, or in any place under that person&#39;s control, to possess or consume liquor, may be fined $2,000 and/or sentenced up to one year in jail.   If the minor is less than 14 years old, or the violation is a second offense within six years, the minimum penalty is $1,000 fine and up to six months in jail.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
      So when I give my son a sip, are they saying I am or am not going to get a fine and jail?  Not that I really care, what are they going to do stand in the middle of the country and watch in my windows?<br/>

So if you hand your child a beer to give to Dad out mowing the lawn, <br/>
that&#39;s fine (as far as I can figure out) but if you hand your child <br/>
a beer - for the purpose of your child drinking it - that&#39;s where <br/>

In NM, it&#39;s illegal for a checker/cashier under age 21 to even scan alcohol and put it into your bag.  The grocery store here has signs for the register when the checker is underage telling customers they can&#39;t buy alcohol at that register.  At Walmart, the underage checker has to call a manager to pick up the alcohol container, scan it and put it into the bag -- they aren&#39;t even allowed to touch it.<br/>
 <br/>
Just totally bizzare.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1928017308">The second one actually states possession OR consumption<br/>
<br/>
The difference between the two laws seems more to me to be who gets<br/>
charged.  In the first one, the minor gets charged, while in the<br/>
second one, the furnisher gets charged.<br/>
<br/>
Kind of like the difference between possessing drugs and distributing them.<br/>
<br/>
On the plus side, the second one would be harder to prove - basically<br/>
you would need a witness observing the actual change in possession,<br/>
while in the first one you would only need to see that the child had<br/>
the alcohol.<br/>
