Hello,<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
My name is Danielle Gervais. I&#39;m a Casting Producer for ABC&#39;s Primetime show, &quot;Wife Swap.&quot; I hope you don&#39;t mind me contacting you, but we&#39;re gearing up for a fourth season at the moment and we&#39;re currently looking for one-of-a-kind families with plenty of personality! Specifically, we&#39;re looking for moms and dads who strongly believe in parenting �outside the box.� Please feel free to forward this email on to anyone you think would be interested in taking part in this once-in-a-lifetime experience. <br/>
 <br/>
In case you are unfamiliar with the show, the premise of Wife Swap is to take two different families and have the moms switch places to experience how another family lives. Half of the week, mom lives the life of the family she is staying with. Then she introduces a &quot;rule change&quot; where she implements rules and activities that her family has. It&#39;s a positive experience for people to not only learn but teach about other families and other ways of life. Wife Swap airs on Disney owned ABC television on Mondays at 8 pm- the family hour!<br/>
 <br/>
Requirements: Each family must consist of two parents and at least one child between 7 and 17 and should reside in the continental U.S. (There may be other children living in the home who are older or younger than the required age�as long as one child is in the required age range.)<br/>
 <br/>
Participating in the show is a very unique experience that can be life changing for everyone. In addition, each family that tapes an episode of Wife Swap receives $20,000 as compensation for their time. Anyone who refers a family that appears on our program receives $1000 as a &#39;thank you� from us.<br/>
 <br/>
I appreciate you taking the time to read this email and I hope to hear from you soon. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me! If you&#39;re interested in learning more, please include your contact information.<br/>
 <br/>
Thank you for your time,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1247375256">The only problem of doing their show is they edit it to make you look<br/>
however they want to portray you.  To PROVE you&#39;re crazy sort of<br/>
thinking.  Rarely have I seen any of their shows that the mom&#39;s were<br/>
portrayed nicely.  Sounds like their looking for the &#39;out of the box&#39; <br/>
to set up against a strict ruling type of parent.  Or someone who will<br/>
force your kids to attend school to &#39;prove&#39; you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re<br/>
doing.<br/>
 <br/>
Now, I will admit that I have &#39;threatened&#39; (I use that term loosely because that&#39;s<br/>
how my kids view it) to do that show if I  could get one of those hyper<br/>
clean freaks in to scour all the cabinets and corners, and rebuild the barn and<br/>
plant the new fields...  Lol... <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-382727843">I have thought about going on this show many times.<br/>
& many people have suggested it to us.<br/>
but i just dont think the stress and the way they will<br/>
come in our home and disect it apart, criticize , etc.<br/>
is worth the 20,000 dollars they pay you.<br/>
i feel they would have a double whammy hay-day with us, <br/>
since we are completely tattooed / free-thinking type of ppl,<br/>
combined with the unschooling <br/>
thing.. i dont need that kind of stress- not for all the <br/>
money in the world.<br/>
plus, they always make the homeschoolers look like the <br/>
&quot; crazy ppl&quot; who need the convential mothers &quot; help&quot;.<br/>
its sickening.</div>

Do you have a blog?<br/>
Last year, they contacted a homeschooling family via the husband&#39;s blog.<br/>
His response was priceless and made the rounds through yahoo hs&#39;ing groups.<br/>
You could always ask them how they found you.<br/>
Send the first one like you&#39;re thrilled and curious, otherwise, they probably won&#39;t<br/>
respond.  Good luck and if you find out, please fill us in?<br/>

Funny ! I got he same e-mail today. Wonder where they got my e-mail from....I would not do it. My kids are too young anyway.It would be cool to have a radical unschooling family do it.But I think it is too much stress some kids.AlexWildflower Car &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:unschoolfool@...">unschoolfool@...</a>&gt; wrote:I received this e-mail today.

I&#39;m a Casting Producer for ABC&#39;s Primetime show, &quot;Wife Swap.&quot; I hope you don&#39;t mind me contacting you, but we&#39;re gearing up for a fourth season at the moment and we&#39;re currently looking for one-of-a-kind families with plenty of personality! Specifically, we&#39;re looking for moms and dads who strongly believe in<br/>
 parenting �outside the box.� Please feel free to forward this email on to anyone you think would be interested in taking part in this once-in-a-lifetime experience. In case you are unfamiliar with the show, the premise of Wife Swap is to take two different families and have the moms switch places to experience how another family lives. Half of the week, mom lives the life of the family she is staying with. Then she introduces a &quot;rule change&quot; where she implements rules and activities that her family has. It&#39;s a positive experience for people to not only learn but teach about other families and other ways of life. Wife Swap airs on Disney owned ABC television on Mondays at 8 pm- the family hour!Requirements: Each family must consist of two parents and at least one child between 7 and 17 and should reside in the continental U.S. (There may be other children living in the home who are older or younger than the required age�as long as one child is in<br/>
 the required age range.)Participating in the show is a very unique experience that can be life changing for everyone. In addition, each family that tapes an episode of Wife Swap receives $20,000 as compensation for their time. Anyone who refers a family that appears on our program receives $1000 as a &#39;thank you� from us.I appreciate you taking the time to read this email and I hope to hear from you soon. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me! If you&#39;re interested in learning more, please include your contact information.Thank you for your time,Danielle <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Gervais646-747-7956Danielle.Gervais@...">Gervais646-747-7956Danielle.Gervais@...</a> Gervais| Casting AP | ABC Television | Wife SwapRDF USA| 1790 Broadway | 11th Floor| New York| NY 10019tel. + 1 646 747 7956| fax. + 1 212 586 <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:3419danielle.gervais@...">3419danielle.gervais@...</a> | www.rdfusa.comNo virus found in this outgoing message.Checked by AVG Free Edition.Version: 7.5.488 / Virus Database: 269.14.13/1075 - Release<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-226430628">If you think about it long-term, you could lose more then $20,000 over <br/>
how they portray your family. You could lose local business, your job <br/>
threatened etc...if they decide to make you look a certain way. Happy, <br/>
healthy families don&#39;t make for great television.<br/>
<br/>
They contacted us after the People magazine article 1.5 years ago. We <br/>
thought long and hard about it because the money sounded so good at <br/>
that point. I&#39;m really glad we decided against it. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1897122310">LOL I&#39;d love to see how she&#39;d manage to overrule DH, since he&#39;s the at<br/>
home parent so he wouldn&#39;t be off leaving DS and the dog and the fish at<br/>
her mercy - DH would try to be polite but bottom line is, she&#39;s a guest<br/>
and he&#39;s the Dad. Quite honestly, she&#39;d probably be bored silly because<br/>
DH and DS would go about their usual days and ignore her most of the<br/>
time if she got to be a pest. If she wanted to play videogames (or even<br/>
just hear about them and politely discuss things), she&#39;d do fine. If she<br/>
likes Spongebob and Dirty Jobs and Iron Chef and Dr. Who, great. If she<br/>
tried to create rules about games and TV, uh nope, wouldn&#39;t happen<br/>
because DH is as much of a gamer as DS.<br/>
 <br/>
Wouldn&#39;t happen though - there&#39;s no way I&#39;d experiment with my family<br/>
for the entertainment of the masses<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1722178033">My dd watched this show (with me along for the ride) for two whole seasons.<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t go on it for $10000 or even 20.  I can&#39;t remember a single<br/>
episode where I felt comfortable with the swap and I was completely aghast<br/>
when there were very young kids.  Maybe teens with great egos and a sense of<br/>
humor would feel the money was worth it.  Also, I can&#39;t remember if it was<br/>
this one or the other one (trading spouses) but one of them let the guest<br/>
wife decide how the money was to be spent.  So you would get to decide for<br/>
the family you visited but the visiting wife would decide for you and your<br/>
family.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Now if you could somehow secretly arrange to be swapped with someone on this<br/>
list. that would be different :-)<br/>

She&#39;s thinking of a different show, Trading Spouses. On Wife Swap you<br/>
get the $20,000 handed over to you and it&#39;s yours straight up. On<br/>
Trading Spouses it&#39;s a different amount and each family gets to decide<br/>
how a portion of the money is spent for other family they traded with.<br/>
