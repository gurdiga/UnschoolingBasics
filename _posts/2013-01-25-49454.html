<div id="ygrps-yiv-1425258827">Hello all -<br/>
<br/>
I am an unschooling mother of two daughters, ages 11 and almost 9.  I have no problem with the idea of video games, and I was intrigued by some articles that I read recently, about the benefits of video game play.<br/>
<br/>
Some new articles and videos on video games. Very positive:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-why-experts-think-playing-video-games-actually-make-you-smarter-2012-1?op=1http://video.msnbc.msn.com/the-cycle/50412970#50412970">http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-why-experts-think-playing-video-games-actually-make-you-smarter-2012-1?op=1http://video.msnbc.msn.com/the-cycle/50412970#50412970</a><br/>
<br/>
My problem is that I have no idea where to start to find a game or games that would appeal to my daughters.  I love the idea that video games can require problem solving, persistence in trying to complete a quest, and enduring failure along the way.  And that they can be darn fun, apparently, too!  I just have no idea where these games can be found.<br/>
<br/>
We do not have Wii or Xbox or whatever else may be required.  We do, however, have a couple of good computers, so we could play online games, or games that came on a cd-rom.<br/>
<br/>
My girls have played Disney Fairies.  They have also played Marc Brown Arthur educational games, and ClueFinders educational games.  I know that these are different from the ongoing, total environment kind of games, but again, we have no experience with these yet.  They have read Harry Potter, so they do like fantasy and wizards.  They are still quite young, and are pretty girly, and have not expressed any interest in weapons thusfar.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have some suggestions for us?<br/>
Thank You -<br/>

Maybe a potentially bigger problem than not knowing where to start with video games is deciding you need to find video games for them to play ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I know that sounds odd! And I&#39;m speaking more broadly rather than specifically to your situation so it may not apply. This society tends to focus on ends and finding means to those ends. Parents can end up thinking, &quot;If only they&#39;d get more into science kits and experiments! Being interested in them is a pathway to a great career in science!&quot; And then focus on finding that one perfect science project that will spark their interest.<br/>
<br/>
At that point, the problem is the parent has shifted her view from her kids to the science experiments. She isn&#39;t seeing the doorways her kids are fascinated by but the doorways she thinks her kids would benefit by being fascinated by.<br/>
<br/>
Kids -- all people really -- have &quot;interest magnets&quot; inside of them. What they pull towards them gives others clues about what kind of magnets each has inside. We can&#39;t change the nature of those magnets by pushing things at them. We can, though, help their unique set of magnets grow by noticing what kids pull towards them and giving them more and by putting in reach stuff that feels related that also might interest them.<br/>
<br/>
If your kids never get into problem solving games, that&#39;s okay. It won&#39;t hurt their problem solving abilities ;-) It will, though, indicate they are looking at life through different lenses, lenses that aren&#39;t about hard core problem solving. They might be more interested in relationships or patterns. By looking at what interests them, look for lots of different ways for them to explore those interests. If they love TV shows, give them more TV shows and stuff related to the shows they love. If they love being with friends, give them more opportunities to be with friends. Whatever they&#39;re drawn to is what&#39;s important to what&#39;s inside of them.<br/>
<br/>
What might help you see more pathways to connect outward from your girls -- rather than getting your girls to connect to the world -- is the Facebook group:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-896419335">My girls are now 11 & 12 and the site they used to  love and be on all the<br/>
time is called  www.fantage.com  they both seem to have moved on now but I<br/>
still go there because in the &#39;arcade&#39; there&#39;s a game called block builder<br/>
or something like that and it&#39;s a lot like Tetrus so I have them get me in<br/>
so I can play that. They are now really big into Minecraft and we got the<br/>
younger one an account - it was like ? $25 for the year but they use it all<br/>
the time and they&#39;re both quite happy. I hear them giggle all the time and<br/>
of course always ask - &#39;whats so funny?&#39; to which the standard reply is<br/>
&#39;Mom, you won&#39;t get it&#39; it&#39;s a minecraft video&#39; and they are right - I<br/>
don&#39;t get it but they are happy.<br/>

Good luck finding things that inspire and entertain your girls.<br/>

<br/>
If you have friends with games, the easiest thing to do is to ask for your kids to be able to try some so they can get a sense of what they like and what formats are appealing. That will also help You get a sense of the kinds of games which are &quot;out there&quot; - it helps a lot to know the difference between a SIM game, a puzzle game, and an adventure/quest game.<br/>
<br/>
Once you have a game or two the kids like, the easiest way to find something similar is to go to Amazon or your favorite online shopping resource, look up that game and follow the &quot;other customers who looked at this/bought this also bought...&quot; link trails. That&#39;s also a good place to read reviews of games and get a sense of how long it takes to play, how difficult a game it is, and how much &quot;replay factor&quot; it has. <br/>

<br/>
Minecraft.net<br/>
Roblox.com<br/>
Wizard101.com<br/>
Runescape<br/>
  Lots of games on HUB, Nick , Nickjr, Disney<br/>
 Start with online games and then go to a gaming store and play some. <br/>
I would start by getting an older Wii or a Nindendo DS ( older model) very cheap. See what they like first! You can rent games<br/>
at Gamefly.com tp try before buying,<br/>
