&gt; **The question was, when there is a trigger that you can&#39;t eliminate,<br/>
&gt;  how do<br/>
&gt;  *you* *me* *anyone* IN THE MOMENT deal with that? **<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  I go into silent mode for a moment. If Payge and Damien are playing<br/>
&gt;  and Payge accidentally pulls Damien too hard and he gets hurt, I go<br/>
&gt;  silent. I walk over pick up my son and comfort him. Then after a<br/>
&gt;  moment, when the initial frustration has passed I ease back into<br/>
&gt;  speaking. This period of silence helps me regroup, and avoid saying<br/>
&gt;  something I&#39;d regret. When I start speaking I&#39;ll ask Damien if he&#39;s<br/>
&gt;  okay. We&#39;ll talk about how Payge was having so much fun playing, that<br/>
&gt;  she didn&#39;t recognize her own strength. At this point we&#39;re usually<br/>
&gt;  all gathered together talking about what happened, and how we can try<br/>
&gt;  to make it so it doesn&#39;t happen again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  I know that discussing it may be difficult since Morgan&#39;s<br/>
&gt;  communication is still blossoming. If you can remember before<br/>
&gt;  reacting to just stay silent till you are calmer (even 30 seconds can<br/>
&gt;  make a big difference) it helps a lot. In your moment of silence<br/>
&gt;  still go and comfort the dog.<br/>
