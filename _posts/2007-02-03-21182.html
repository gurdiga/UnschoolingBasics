<div id="ygrps-yiv-381957768">Issue 4 of *Connections: ezine of unschooling and mindful parenting* is <br/>
now available online: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://connections.organiclearning.org">http://connections.organiclearning.org</a><br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m excited to announce that Robyn Coburn has joined our team of regular <br/>
contributing writers, and she has a great article in this month&#39;s issue <br/>
titled, &quot;She&#39;s Not Me,&quot; celebrating all the wonderful differences <br/>
between mother and daughter.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, Issue 4 features other great regular columns like &quot;Ask Rue,&quot; <br/>
with Rue Kream, author of _Parenting a Free Child_, &quot;Oh, How We Shine!&quot; <br/>
with Anne Ohman and &quot;Unschooling Dads&quot; with Ben Lovejoy along with <br/>
articles by Sandra Dodd and Deb Lewis. This month our feature articles <br/>
by Kathryn Baptista and Pam Laricchia delve into regional conference <br/>
planning, offering hints and tips on pulling together a successful <br/>
unschooling conference, and our &quot;Inspiration Station&quot; offers a <br/>
fascinating article on the Magic of Tarot by Amy Carpenter-Leugs. Hot <br/>
Topics from several email lists cover topics like unschooling faith, <br/>
socialization, and when parents say &quot;no.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy, and thank you for your support!<br/>
