<div id="ygrps-yiv-1648431876">&quot;I am wondering how others deal with a 5yo child who is often <br/>
physically<br/>
aggressive and will not stop when told that the other people do not <br/>
like it, are<br/>
being hurt, are at risk of being hurt, etc. Frequently I find myself <br/>
forcing<br/>
him to stop (holding him, removing him from the situation, etc.), <br/>
which I think<br/>
doesn&#39;t really help the long term situation.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Welcome Rachel, glad you found the list!:)<br/>
<br/>
I have the same problem with my just-turned three year old. He fits <br/>
about 80% of the &quot;highly sensitive&quot; child traits, and lashing out <br/>
suddenly or for no apparent reason is one of the issues we&#39;re <br/>
dealing with right now.<br/>
We haven&#39;t always handled it so well....and this week has been <br/>
especially difficult, but it&#39;s caused me to step back and assess how <br/>
we can better meet his needs to avoid some of the difficulties.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve decided that he needs a LOT of one on one time, more than seems <br/>
reasonable in a family with four children (I mean, the others need <br/>
me too) but I have figured out a few things. First of all, I need to <br/>
BE with him more. He is sometimes happily absorbed in play with his <br/>
sister and things are fine, but if more than one other person is <br/>
involved in his play there is sure to be problems unless I&#39;m RIGHT <br/>
there.<br/>
Do you notice a sensitivity to overstimulation in your child?<br/>
I know Jalen just FEEDS on energy, but not always in a good way. <br/>
When there are several children together it&#39;s hard for him to <br/>
maintain any kind of control, his emotions cause him to hit, kick, <br/>
scratch...even when he seems happy. I&#39;ve never had a child like <br/>
this, so it&#39;s caught me off guard.<br/>
I need to be his filter on stimulation, until he&#39;s old enough to <br/>
filter it himself, or at least communicate his overstimulation.<br/>
<br/>
He also needs to have protein snacks within reach throughout the <br/>
day, to help avoid blood sugar fluctuations. I also think that when <br/>
he seems happy playing with people, I need to find a good moment to <br/>
step in, hug him, re-connect and just remind him that I&#39;m here.<br/>
He needs that physical connection, but doesn&#39;t always know how to <br/>
ask for it.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s also sensitive to certain food additives I think. Mainly red <br/>
40....<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t go looking for a food problem right off the bat, but <br/>
sometimes a sensitive person reacts to food more intensely than the <br/>
rest of us. It&#39;s easy enough for me to keep all the foods he loves <br/>
(in a healthier version) available, so he doesn&#39;t even notice his <br/>
favorite cereal is missing (it&#39;s just a different brand).<br/>
<br/>
I agree with removing them quickly from any kind of situation that <br/>
involves harming another person.<br/>
Sandra once made a suggestion I&#39;ve used some, and that is to remove <br/>
the victim from the situation quickly, and after they&#39;re comforted, <br/>
go back and deal with the aggressor. It puts the attention on the <br/>
victim first, which is nice when they&#39;re already upset, and it gives <br/>
the aggressor a moment of cool off time.<br/>
It doesn&#39;t always work with a toddler in the midst of a melt-down, <br/>
but it can be very useful.<br/>
<br/>
Prevention is my main job right now. With Jalen, it isn&#39;t so easy to <br/>
see the triggers though! Today for example, he wanted a pen from my <br/>
purse. I thought he was going to draw so I handed him the pen and <br/>
asked if he wanted some paper to draw on...he said &quot;nope&quot; and ran <br/>
towards the back of the house. I followed him of course, but by the <br/>
time I caught up, he&#39;d run into where Sierra was, stabbed her with <br/>
the pen and ran back out laughing as she screamed.<br/>
A lot of this behavior is a cause and effect thing for him, I&#39;m <br/>
pretty sure. He&#39;s extremely interested in human behavior, plus he <br/>
has very little understanding of what it feels like for the other <br/>
person. sigh.<br/>
So I&#39;m taking this as a wake-up call. I&#39;ve been too distracted <br/>
lately, and he&#39;s letting me know he needs more of the right kind of <br/>
stimulation (less neighbor kids over, more one-on-one and <br/>
kinisthetic/movement oriented activity). <br/>
<br/>
Have you noticed that your child does better if you get him out <br/>
where he can move a LOT? I know Jalen is happiest if he can <br/>
run/jump/spin/slide etc... so parks, pools and beaches are GREAT! <br/>
We bought a large kiddie pool and that is really a fabulous thing <br/>
for him. Also, any kind of artsy stuff that he can really get his <br/>
hands into....clay/playdough, any kind of painting, rice play (we <br/>
made a big bin of rice with measuring tools, scoops etc..) water <br/>
play, anything tactile.<br/>
I&#39;m planning to buy some more window pens, so they can decorate the <br/>
windows with art. Anything that is remotely messy or touch oriented <br/>
seems to be great for him. Maybe your guy needs more of that?<br/>
<br/>
Just some things that have helped me, I totally sympathize, it&#39;s a <br/>
difficult thing to deal with all that intense energy sometimes.:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1629122459">Thanks everyone for the warm welcome and the good suggestions.  Mostly it<br/>
just helps to know I am not the only &quot;gentle parent&quot; out there with a<br/>
not-always-gentle kid :-)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We&#39;re past this stage now (hope for your future!) but I can remember feeling<br/>
like people were always thinking &quot;She must just be missing the &#39;lead-up&#39; to<br/>
these outbursts.&quot;  But really there was no way to predict when we&#39;d be<br/>
calmly talking about something or reading together or playing together and<br/>
all of a sudden he&#39;d whack us.  The only way to predict it would have been<br/>
to just expect it constantly, and living &#39;on guard&#39; was not something I was<br/>
willing to do.  We did two things that, in conjunction with respectful<br/>
parenting, helped us move from a hopeless place to one where we&#39;re feeling<br/>
more like we&#39;re just working out the kinks -  Sensory Integration<br/>
Occupational Therapy and some<br/>
temporary dietary changes.  If you want to know more I&#39;d be happy to share.<br/>
Your post made me focus on how far we&#39;ve come in the last 2 years, so thanks<br/>
for that!!<br/>
<br/>
My aunt, who unschooled her 4 kids, always maintains that at 5yo kids become<br/>
much more calm and I see this coming for our son.  It really is nice.  Last<br/>
night when our 5yo started being too rough with our 1yo, I got in there and<br/>
wrestled with him instead.  I think I had just been not realizing that he<br/>
wants more wrestling, and won&#39;t stop knocking the baby down because he<br/>
really craves getting knocked down himself.  So, that got him to leave the<br/>
baby alone and probably helped us all have more fun :-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again everyone for the suggestions and the wonderful community!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1439473403">&quot;I think that the kids insistence on being treated with respect and <br/>
not talked down to or ordered about is pretty neat and it&#39;s teaching <br/>
me to be a better person and to treat my kids like the real people <br/>
that they are.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Kids are natural unschoolers, aren&#39;t they?  It&#39;s a good sign that your <br/>
children insist on being treated respectfully....a child that&#39;s been <br/>
beaten down too much will be overly fearful, and won&#39;t speak up for <br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How can I change this to better reflect an<br/>
unschooling attitude? I don&#39;t want to shield her from the consequences <br/>
of her actions, but I also hate to see her faced with this mountainous <br/>
task.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I understand the frustration all too well. But I think you already <br/>
know the answer in your heart. The anger is YOUR issue, not hers. It <br/>
IS a mountainous task and we all need help when something is <br/>
overwhelming.<br/>
My Sierra will also have her room a gargantuan mess, very quickly <br/>
without help. She doesn&#39;t like it that way, but putting things back is <br/>
just too distracting for a creative genius at work!! <br/>
The things that have helped me:<br/>
<br/>
~Recognizing that I have a creative genius at work. Early on, I would <br/>
ask myself &quot;what if I KNEW this child were the next Picasso (or <br/>
Einstein, or Mozart or whatever helps you connect the importance of <br/>
their work) and I realized the mess mattered very little. The <br/>
important thing was having a space for my child to daydream, play and <br/>
create. <br/>
~Seeing the clean up as my gift to her, not something I was trying to <br/>
help her learn or needed her assistance with to feel good about. I <br/>
WANT my child to have a sacred space, a space that she feels calm and <br/>
happy in. I want to give that to her unconditionally.<br/>
~Seeing the clean up time as a time to connect with her, not a time <br/>
for her to help me.  We talk, we laugh, we find interesting objects <br/>
and get sidetracked...this time is just time together, there are no <br/>
constraints on getting the job done a certain way, or in a certain <br/>
amount of time. We might stop and read a book, we might start some <br/>
laundry, we might make a snack, but we&#39;re together.<br/>
She DOES stop to play. I might hand her something and say &quot;here, could <br/>
you toss that over there?&quot; but for the most part, I just keep cleaning.<br/>
<br/>
The results?<br/>
<br/>
She happily helps me out after I start cleaning sometimes (not always, <br/>
but more than you&#39;d believe). She willingly helps me out around the <br/>
house, she much prefers cooking and cleaning in the kitchen, than <br/>
cleaning her room.<br/>
It&#39;s wonderful to see the results of totally backing off the chores <br/>
thing. My children are truly sweet and help from a place within their <br/>
hearts, not because some adult makes them.<br/>
Sierra might make a disaster of her room, but she sweetly and kindly <br/>
offers to unload the dishwasher, set the table etc...she OFFERS this <br/>
help, with no outside forces upon her.<br/>
<br/>
Help your dd clean her room because she needs you. Help her because it <br/>
will give her a wonderful place to play and BE. Help her out because <br/>
it&#39;s a time to connect with her, whether she&#39;s helping or not. Help <br/>
her because she&#39;s alive and healthy and collecting memories of her <br/>
childhood. Realize how fortunate you are to have a healthy kid to <br/>
clean up after.:) Truly.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When she comes up to me asking for something to do because<br/>
she is bored I tell her she can pick up the clothes in her room. This<br/>
usually sets off a pouting spree about how hard it is and how she does <br/>
not want to and I tell not to do it if she does not want to.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When a child says they&#39;re bored, they&#39;re looking for a FUN idea, not a <br/>
lame &quot;go clean up your room&quot; from Mom. I remember my mother doing <br/>
this, and I resented it immensely....I felt she didn&#39;t understand me <br/>
or care about my feelings in that moment.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than make the room an issue, give her some fun ideas and offer <br/>
to do some of them with her. I like to keep an &quot;idea&quot; list available, <br/>
for those moments when we need some inspiration.<br/>
<br/>
Heck, don&#39;t just clean her room. Go paint it and hang lovely materials <br/>
and fill it with things that make her happy! Create a little reading <br/>
nook, or build a window seat or buy her a new comforter...make her <br/>
room her HAVEN.:)<br/>
And when she messes it up again, try to own the frustration as YOUR <br/>
feelings, not something she did to you. Try to see it as a chance to <br/>
wipe the slate clean once again, and give your creative genius a <br/>
lovely space in which to grow and learn.<br/>
<br/>
I do this virtually every day....it takes a while to wrap your mind <br/>
around this way of living...but the results are WELL worth the time, <br/>
honest.<br/>
