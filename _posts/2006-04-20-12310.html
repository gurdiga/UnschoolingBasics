<div id="ygrps-yiv-1859158433">Well apparently Courtney thought that if she stayed home she was going to have to do bookwork just like at school and she did not want me teaching her. <br/>
   <br/>
  She really surprised the heck out of me when she asked if she could stay home next year but not have to do anyschool work like now. <br/>
   <br/>
  anyhow long story short she is now happy to stay home and unschool. <br/>
   <br/>
  yippeee!!!!<br/>
