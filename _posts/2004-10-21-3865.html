<div id="ygrps-yiv-158133582">&quot;Create a print-rich environment - in many more ways than just reading <br/>
together. But, do pick some books that he might pick up the reading in, <br/>
quickly, like Hop on Pop, so that he has a chance at it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I absolutely agree.  I do think reading together is key, however. <br/>
My son (2.75) learned to read, just as he learned to speak, by osmosis...<br/>
I always read to him, he always wanted me too, (still does, thank goodness, though he can read himself).   By being read to frequently and also much time examining books himself, he learned to read well.  He can presently read nearly as well as me.  He nails words like application, Antartica, revealing.  He can definitely read as fast as I can type, as he sometimes reads aloud over my shoulder.  Yesterday, I discovered when he took my grocery list, that he can read cursive (I cannot fathom how this happened except that my cursive is sort of a hybrid and I guess the letters are recognizable...)  Anyway,  I realize that there are different sorts of intelligences and also that most children don&#39;t have an easy of a time of it as Will did, but by seeing how naturally it did come for him, I imagine that any child who wants to read could also pick it up through absorbing themselves in books....being read to, looking at books themselves, especially with mother or someone nearby...(Will<br/>
 always needs me available to answer &quot;what&#39;s this word,&quot; or &quot;what does this mean?&quot;)   While his awareness and desire for this skill may have been earlier than some other childrens, I would think that any older child would have the same skill and be able to learn to read with the same kind of natural flow and ease.<br/>
So what I am saying is, if you read to them and with them, I believe they will absolutely pick it up.  <br/>
Peace and all good,<br/>
Millie<br/>

<br/>
I just wanted to give you some peace of mind about reading.  It wasn&#39;t <br/>
until 3rd grade that I finally was able to read.  I love to read now <br/>
and I finish anywhere from 2 to 3 books a week.  Let&#39;s just say the <br/>
librarian knows me well.  <br/>
<br/>
My dd who started reading at 6, and went to ps for grades 1-3, hated <br/>
to read.  She says it was boring and just didn&#39;t enjoy it.  We started <br/>
unschooling last year, she is just now started to read on her own.  <br/>
It&#39;s not War & Peace, but a very good book about Joan of Arc.  She <br/>
wants to study the Middle Ages.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, if you read to her when she wants to she&#39;ll pick it up.  <br/>
My mother worried too, so did the teachers.  Thank God that was back <br/>
in the 60&#39;s before all the testing and labels of today. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-857717360">Reading to a child won&#39;t necessarily make a reader of that child. Not to say <br/>
that you shouldn&#39;t read to your children, but maybe you shouldn&#39;t feel like <br/>
a failure, like you didn&#39;t do the right things, or that they didn&#39;t do the <br/>
right things is they aren&#39;t reading yet.<br/>
<br/>
My son Simon, who is 10, is not among the readers yet. I&#39;ve read to him <br/>
since he was tiny. Anything he wanted, and I still do. And I have no fears <br/>
but that he will join the ranks of the reading at some point. Linnaea, who <br/>
is 7, is reading. She started reading about 6 months ago. And I was really <br/>
nervous that Simon would feel like he wasn&#39;t as good or as smart or <br/>
something because his little sister had beaten him to the reading goal. He <br/>
absolutely wasn&#39;t. He feels no shame in not reading yet. He knows he has <br/>
strengths that she doesn&#39;t have, and he totally believes he will be a reader <br/>
someday, just not yet.<br/>
<br/>
There are interesting benefits to not being a reader. Simon listens much <br/>
better than I or Linnaea do. He sees things in video games or in movies that <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t because I look for the information in text. When I read to him, <br/>
he will walk away with a better understanding, greater memory for detail of <br/>
the story/book than I ever do.<br/>
<br/>
There may be reasons other than exposure or focus that keep a child from <br/>
reading. As far as I know and believe, those things will be overcome with <br/>
time. Someone recently said on some list or another that it was their child <br/>
playing a video game that got them reading, they&#39;d realized that it would be <br/>
easier to negotiate the game if they could understand what was being said in <br/>
text. And I realized that the poster of that e-mail thought their child <br/>
wasn&#39;t reading before that because they weren&#39;t interested enough, they <br/>
weren&#39;t trying hard enough. Maybe the timing of that particular video game <br/>
went hand and hand with that child being actually ready to read. Maybe the <br/>
game and all of the other pieces of the literacy puzzle came together at the <br/>
same moment.<br/>
<br/>
Reading is an important tool in most people&#39;s lives. Your children will want <br/>
to negotiate the world fully and will, given time and exposure, master <br/>
reading without being pressured to do worksheets or to read on command or to <br/>
play a phonics game. Just don&#39;t think they are lazy, or not trying hard <br/>
enough or that you haven&#39;t read to them enough if they aren&#39;t reading by the <br/>
time you believe they ought to be.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We don&#39;t have reading &quot;issues&quot; because I trust that my children will<br/>
read when they&#39;re ready. What are your reading skills like? Do you<br/>
enjoy reading to them? Are you an example of joyful exploration in<br/>
life, including reading? What kind of feelings have they picked up<br/>
about reading and learning so far?<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like they&#39;ve had a lot of stress over much of<br/>
&quot;learning&quot;....which isn&#39;t learning at all. I&#39;m going to be very honest<br/>
with you (this isn&#39;t a judgment, just something I noticed) and that is<br/>
your post has no punctuation, several mispellings and is generally<br/>
difficult to read.<br/>
<br/>
YET, I understood your point, I heard what you had to say and you got<br/>
your message across. Isn&#39;t that the whole point? There are times we<br/>
need to relate messages more clearly, but obviously not everyone needs<br/>
fabulous reading or writing skills to enjoy life.:)<br/>
<br/>
So relax. Focus on doing things that help you connect to your kids. Do<br/>
things that connect you all to the joy of LIVING. Do things that<br/>
nourish your spirits and trust that learning will happen...in it&#39;s own<br/>
way and time.<br/>

You can tell the family members several things:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Butt OUT! They&#39;re my kids, not yours.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We&#39;ll try this for a year and see how it works. If it doesn&#39;t, we&#39;ll <br/>
try something else. They won&#39;t be &#39;ruined&#39; in just one year.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If you&#39;d like to learn more about unschooling, I&#39;d be happy to give <br/>
you books and links and magazines and articles and essays. After you&#39;ve <br/>
completed all the homework I&#39;ve given you, THEN we can talk rationally <br/>
and intelligently about it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;ve done the research on unschooling, and we&#39;re doing it now. Until <br/>
*you* have done the research, you are uninformed and misinformed.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Unschooling has made *such* a difference in the kids&#39; attitudes about <br/>
learning! It&#39;s just amazing---they can&#39;t get enough of it!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Thanks for your advice. Please pass the bean dip.&quot;<br/>

Duncan is eleven and can read almost everything. He&#39;s *one step* from <br/>
being a full reader.<br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t want me to read books to him right now (but when Harry comes <br/>
out next month, he&#39;ll have me glued to my glasses! &lt;G&gt;), but he still <br/>
asks that I read things that flash by on the tv screen and some things <br/>
on the computer.<br/>
<br/>
I read them to him. All the time. Usually the next time he sees that <br/>
same thing, he can read it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a process. One I&#39;m happy to nurture along at whatever pace is <br/>
comfortable for him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-535044074">My 11-year old JUST started to read over the past three months or <br/>
so.  Over the last couple years he has progressed, very slowly, in <br/>
that area but we just let him be, knowing that he would learn when he <br/>
was ready.  He went from hardly reading at all to reading everything, <br/>
almost overnight- literally!<br/>
<br/>
What is interesting to me, comparing my oldest, who was an early <br/>
reader to Tristan who was a late reader, is that Kevin went through <br/>
the whole &quot;inventive&quot; spelling phase.  He would write but you had to <br/>
try really hard to decipher what he was trying to say - we were just <br/>
reading some of his stuff the other day and getting some chuckles.  <br/>
Tristan is not doing that like Kev did.  Tristan asks how to spell <br/>
things when he is writing and, for the most part, knows how things <br/>
are spelled because he didn&#39;t really learn how to read by phonics, <br/>
like Kev did. And because he is so much older I guess it is more <br/>
important to him to spell it right, I don&#39;t know.  <br/>
<br/>
The process with Tristan has been a lot less painful for me.  I know <br/>
Tristan had some frustrations at times with really wanting to know <br/>
how to read but not being ready, and knowing that.  But for me it <br/>
just seemed like a natural process without some of the awkwardness <br/>
that is associated with a new reader.<br/>
<br/>
And in regards to the ADHD and Dyslexia, Tristan definitely has some <br/>
issues in that regards too.  We choose not to slap a label on him but <br/>
certainly, if he was in school, he would have been labeled with a <br/>
learning disability.  My husband had dyslexia too and he didn&#39;t learn <br/>
how to read until about 10, in the public school system!  Relax, and <br/>
it will happen just as it is supposed to.  If you push, they will <br/>
only learn how to hate reading.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1020932776">Hi Kara,<br/>
<br/>
I have been a lurker here and I admit I have not fully embraced<br/>
unschooling but I am fascinated by it and am learning so much by<br/>
reading answers to questions on this board. Thanks to all you wise and<br/>
wonderful people. What I wanted to tell you I realize may not be<br/>
generally accepted by the group but I feel there are aspects of it<br/>
that have been helpful to my son. <br/>
<br/>
I initially started to homeschool my 9yo ds for dyslexia (he is<br/>
probably ADD too but never diagnosed I see no need at this point) in<br/>
Sept 06. and our journey has brought us here to the unschooling board<br/>
and a very free and self directed atmosphere at home. Perhaps we are<br/>
deschooling but I have not committed to the saying it just yet, but<br/>
that is a whole other post:^).  I have been hoping to come across<br/>
unschoolers with dyslexia and hear how they may have transitioned from<br/>
a ps or homeschool situations and your experiences. So if you are out<br/>
there would love to hear from you. <br/>
<br/>
I am also lucky that I have no outside family interference regarding<br/>
my choices of schooling at this point, so I am of no help there other<br/>
than to say, If you are happy and your kids are happy with how they<br/>
are learning ignore the outsiders input. <br/>
<br/>
This is one thing I have done to help my ds with his dyslexia and<br/>
thought since you asked I would put it out there. Are you familiar<br/>
with Ron Davis and his book The Gift of Dyslexia, he created Davis<br/>
Dyslexia Correction Program. I found this to be an effective way for<br/>
my son to deal with his learning style. Ron Davis discusses how a<br/>
dyslexic thinks in pictures, they are visual, multi-dimensional<br/>
thinkers. I bet your kids are very imaginative and creative love<br/>
building things with their hands but have little interest in reading<br/>
or writing and possibly math. My son would rather draw than write and<br/>
at this point I encourage it. Yes there are some schooly aspects of<br/>
the program. They mold the alphabet in clay as well as punctuation and<br/>
then sight words. Davis explains that because a dyslexic think in<br/>
pictures, sight word are hard to memorize as there is no picture for<br/>
them. So they must create a 3d image of what they feel the word means<br/>
after hearing the definition. [ My son was so proud in Kindergarten he<br/>
could spell cat by 2nd grade that is the only word he would spell if<br/>
we played hangman or something. He got A&#39;s on his spelling test after<br/>
intense night before drill but could not recall or spell the words<br/>
after that]. This follow up work of clay words was great at first, but<br/>
soon the novelty wore off so we eventually stopped doing as my son<br/>
grew weary of it. This is what made me look even further into more<br/>
relaxed and self directed learning.<br/>
<br/>
The things it improved were his ability to focus, and I am not talking<br/>
about reading or doing school work( although this has improved for<br/>
other greatly), I am talking....being able to find his shoes,<br/>
following directions, paying attention in Tae Kwon Do, got his green<br/>
stripe 3 months faster  etc..is it perfect no he is nine but they are<br/>
better and these are thing he wanted to be better at and this is how<br/>
he applied his new knowledge. He felt better about himself that he<br/>
could understand his learning style and ways to help him deal with it.<br/>
He feels smart now not stupid which is how he felt in school.  I have<br/>
taken to creating an atmosphere that my son likes to learn by<br/>
appealing to him through these outlets. He watches documentaries of<br/>
his choosing, for the last 3 weeks he obsessively watched anything on<br/>
dinosaurs. Loves shows Bonehead detectives, Prehistoric Planet etc. I<br/>
no longer sit and force him to read if he does not want to. I read to<br/>
him when he is interested. OKay people here is the part don&#39;t shoot me<br/>
for :-)! I do ask him to do an www.time4learning.com a couple of time<br/>
a week which he likes and if  he is not in the mood I do not force him.<br/>
<br/>
What I find in most adult dyslexic success stories is that even after<br/>
years of remediation that never really got them anywhere but feeling<br/>
lost and inadequate they finally learned to compensate and deal with<br/>
their issues when they were interested in really learning and no one<br/>
was forcing them.  Usually high school or college age. So I keep<br/>
reading up and encouraging him where I can and let his natural love of<br/>
learning bloom. <br/>
<br/>
The one thing about Davis I forgot to mention is the disorientation.<br/>
Davis explains that dyslexics experience by varying degrees a<br/>
disorientation which causes the symptoms of dyslexia. My son cries<br/>
very easily depending on the situation can get confused very easily<br/>
and processes verbal information slowly. They teach a dyslexic to use<br/>
his highly visual mind to align his body and stop the disorientation.<br/>
It sound like mumbo jumbo but it works. Add to this a simple breathing<br/>
exercise of blowing out a breath and releasing the stress, This was<br/>
HUGE for him. Is he still hyper sensitive oh yes.. but now he has<br/>
coping tools. You can learn and do these things on your own it is all<br/>
the book or you can work with a facilitator which can run you<br/>
2500-4000. A facilitator would evaluate if they think you are a<br/>
candidate, the visualization and maturity can be a deciding factor and<br/>
the child or adult absolutely has to want to do it. There is nothing<br/>
coerced about it.<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah since I do not bother Jake about reading he now reads on his<br/>
own or at least tries to. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1073828516">I have a 20yo son who has always been unschooled. He was a very late <br/>
(in terms of &quot;normal&quot;) reader - about 11 before he started. He has <br/>
two older brothers who read at 6 and 7, but I honestly rarely worried <br/>
about the third (because I was very comfortable in our unschooling <br/>
and knew he would read when he was ready!) It was when he was about <br/>
15 or 16 that I discovered he probably had dyslexia! He was (and <br/>
still is) incredibly artsy and very creative. (For the last couple of <br/>
years he&#39;s been a cell phone game artist for a cell phone game <br/>
programmer in Israel. We lived in MN, the boss lives in Israel - they <br/>
did all their work over the internet.) When he was about 15 or 16 we <br/>
were helping someone move and he was labeling the boxes - and every <br/>
number he wrote was a perfect mirror image! It was then that I <br/>
learned a little bit about dyslexia and he did seem to have traits <br/>
associated with it. We never did do anything about it... and he&#39;s <br/>
certainly fully able to read and to function - he doesn&#39;t write much <br/>
(except on the computer LOL) and he got all As in his college <br/>
composition classes. Now I have another little dd who is 9 and is <br/>
struggling to read. We are not pushing her, but she wants to so <br/>
badly! She actually told me that the letters move around on the page! <br/>
It seems if we can slow her down a little, she does OK, but it&#39;s very <br/>
frustrating for her. I am interested in reading more about Ron Davis <br/>
and his book The Gift of Dyslexia. This might give us some tools to <br/>
help my dd over some of her stumbling blocks. She too is extremely <br/>
creative and very visual.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;He felt better about himself that he<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is exactly what I want for my dd. To feel comfortable with <br/>
herself - even though she&#39;s obviously very different from several of <br/>
her siblings! I want her to understand her learning style and see <br/>
that &quot;it&#39;s OK.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is what I think happened to my boy with dyslexia. He just <br/>
learned to deal with it (even though we didn&#39;t really know it was <br/>
there until quite late!) and he&#39;s certainly compensating marvelously.<br/>

If I don&#39;t like to bake bread, I&#39;ll get bread from the store.  If I don&#39;t <br/>
want to fold laundry, I&#39;ll leave it in the basket.  If I want to learn to <br/>
ride a unicycle I&#39;ll get a unicycle and start learning to balance.<br/>
<br/>
People do what they&#39;re *ready* to do, where they&#39;re ready to do it.   People <br/>
do what interests them or what they have a good reason to do.  People learn <br/>
to read because of exposure to the written language - which is unavoidable <br/>
in our culture- and because reading is useful.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re not here to make every kid the same as every other kid.    The idea <br/>
that there is time frame or a way of learning to read (or do anything <br/>
else&#39;s) that is right and anything outside that time frame is &quot;late&quot; &quot;wrong&quot; <br/>
disordered&quot; &quot;disabled&quot; &quot;dyslexic,&quot; whatever, is a school idea.<br/>
<br/>
***He felt better about himself that he<br/>
could understand his learning style and ways to help him deal with it.<br/>
He feels smart now not stupid which is how he felt in school. ***<br/>
<br/>
I think kids would feel better about themselves altogether if they never <br/>
even heard of &quot;learning styles.&quot;  If they just knew (because they never <br/>
heard otherwise) that all people are born perfectly suited to be humans and <br/>
all will learn what they need to learn.  I think the majority of kids who <br/>
worry about learning, do so because adults (usually teachers) make it known <br/>
in subtle and overt ways that there is &quot;a way&quot; to learn, and be, and if <br/>
they&#39;re not that particular way they&#39;re wrong.    If a kid says he wishes he <br/>
could read it would be better for a mom to say &quot;You will, and until you do <br/>
I&#39;ll read for you and to you and lets go for a hike.(or a swim or a bike <br/>
ride),&quot; than for a mom to say,  &quot;Ok, lets find a program that fits your <br/>
learning style.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
No matter how relaxed, a mom who thinks she&#39;s going to help her child learn <br/>
to read with a program that fits his learning style, that mom is going to <br/>
become teacherly.  Teachers almost always end up making little kids feel <br/>
like there&#39;s something wrong with them.<br/>
<br/>
When kids are worried about reading that should be a the mom&#39;s cue to find <br/>
lots of fun stuff to do that doesn&#39;t involve reading.  Go outside and play <br/>
Frisbee.  Climb trees, go get ice cream, rent a boat, make dirt angels, <br/>
stand on your head, have a water balloon fight.   Don&#39;t focus on the thing <br/>
that already has a kid feeling bad about himself.  Do something different <br/>
and fill up that kid&#39;s life with so much joy that reading is at the way back <br/>
of his mind and the very bottom of his list of things to worry over.<br/>
<br/>
***OKay people here is the part don&#39;t shoot me<br/>
for :-)! I do ask him to do an www.time4learning.com a couple of time<br/>
a week which he likes and if he is not in the mood I do not force him.***<br/>
<br/>
We won&#39;t shoot you but we do get to talk about it since you brought it here. <br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
Why do want him to do this particular thing?<br/>
Why do you think of learning as something one must make time for?<br/>
What do you think that site will do for him that play wouldn&#39;t?<br/>

I think it can be really valuble for parents to do some research on <br/>
different learning styles and personality types and think about <br/>
those things in relation to our kids - especially if we have a kid <br/>
who doesn&#39;t seem to learn the way *we* do. Programs like the one <br/>
described above are *a* way of approaching different learning <br/>
styles. Not terribly trusting of a child&#39;s natural ability to learn, <br/>
but certainly an attempt to understand *how* particular children <br/>
learn best. <br/>
<br/>
Here are some links to information on learning styles and <br/>
personality types:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-699875356">Janet, There is website for The Gift of Dyslexia and you can find out if there is a trainer in their method in your area.  I am generally against such labels but I also wanted to give my kids all the tools they wanted to use.  There was a trainer in their method 1 hour away even in Montana.  He met us one evening on a river bank and as we picniked he visited with the kids. I have one child who has expressed considerable frustration over her reading (she is 10) but they all participated.  I presented this exactly as I imagined it: a different way to learn things, especially reading, that they might enjoy learning about.  When my son was 10 and couldn&#39;t yet ride a bike he wanted help with this. So we visited an occupational therapist who worked on balance and coordination.  He enjoyed her and there were no labels on the experience.  My dd decided that for now she &#39;didn&#39;t want to learn this guy&#39;s way of reading&#39; and we didn&#39;t, but she knows that she could pick to do this or<br/>
 something else later.  She sees this like art lessons you might choose, etc.  I did like some of the book&#39;s concrete ideas for the kids when they were younger, like making letters and numbers out of clay, so that it is a tactile and visual experience.  Em liked knowing that she could decide whether this fit for her or not, too.   I sometimes think that my own dyslexia was better off unnoticed (drove me crazy in math) but I wonder if I had labeled myself if I&#39;d have pursued my desire to go to med school as bravely!

but I wonder if I had labeled myself if I&#39;d have<br/>
<br/>
pursued my desire to go to med school as bravely!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think this is HUGE!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think that, too often, children who get labeled can use it as---if <br/>
not the excuse, then---the *reason* for not pursuing new and different <br/>
things. I think that, too often, children are stopped from taking risks <br/>
and daring to be (as Cameron put it) *brave* because sometime, <br/>
somewhere *someone* put it into their heads thay they weren&#39;t worthy or <br/>
capable or &quot;normal&quot; even.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Normal* is relative---and relative to an individual. What&#39;s normal for <br/>
me isn&#39;t normal for Cameron or Duncan or Ben---or even my beagle, <br/>
SodaPop. If each person is an individual, then he can pursue his <br/>
interests behind or ahead of other individuals---or not!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Reading late or early or &quot;right on time&quot; (BAH!!!) is no indicator of <br/>
intelligence or capabilities. It&#39;s simply the time that *that* <br/>
individual was ready to read.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If a child is accepted EXACTLY Where He Is NOW throughout his life (or <br/>
at least his *childhood*), he won&#39;t know that he can&#39;t pursue new <br/>
and/or difficult things. But if he begins to *doubt* his capabilities, <br/>
he may stop right there.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve met many adults who won&#39;t try things because they&#39;re afraid of <br/>
failing or because they are afraid of finding out that others were <br/>
right---they can&#39;t. I can&#39;t handle being around these people for a long <br/>
period of time because they don&#39;t DO.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If I could give my children anything (one of the *many* anythings &lt;g&gt;), <br/>
it would be the knowledge that they CAN. Doesn&#39;t matter when or why or <br/>
how: just the possibility that they are capable (and brave)! &lt;g&gt; When <br/>
and IF are up to them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2060526727">I did put it out there so I don&#39;t mind answering. <br/>
<br/>
AM said--improved were his ability to focus...following directions,<br/>
paying attention<br/>
Deb said--Those things would have changed anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Yes at this point I rather agree with you but at the time we decided<br/>
to do Davis I was not in any kind of unschooling type of mind and<br/>
still very schooly in my approach to homeschooling and helping Jake<br/>
with his learning issues. Given what I know now I may very well have<br/>
not done the program, but I do not regret it either.  I am letting my<br/>
son teach me what he needs and I am learning to listen. So we are<br/>
evolving and growing. I do think he gained some positive things and<br/>
that is why I chose to share them since someone asked. What I did not<br/>
touch too much on is my son is very sensitive and cries very easy. He<br/>
misses a lot of information because his mind wanders he is very<br/>
imaginative,day-dreamy but when he snaps back and he has missed things<br/>
it upsets him. Some of these simple exercises simply help him deal<br/>
with his emotions. Is this due to his dyslexia? maybe maybe not, His<br/>
dyslexia is no longer a priority focus. Having a happy kid is. One<br/>
boost to his self esteem I must say was he is thrilled to know that<br/>
people like Einstein and Edison were out of the box thinkers just like<br/>
him who could not read when they were young. Jake is very much into<br/>
science, history and inventing things and keeps a picture journal of<br/>
his inventions. <br/>
<br/>
Deb said - ...I&#39;ll read for you and to you and lets go for a hike.(or<br/>
a swim or a bike <br/>
<br/>
This is where we are now.<br/>
<br/>
Deb said - Teachers almost always end up making little kids feel <br/>
like there&#39;s something wrong with them.<br/>
This is so what I am learning!<br/>
<br/>
Deb said - Why do want him to do this particular thing?<br/>
Why do you think of learning as something one must make time for?<br/>
What do you think that site will do for him that play wouldn&#39;t?<br/>
<br/>
To appease my husband and I admit part of me is not ready to<br/>
completely let go of that schooly part of me. I am just not there yet.<br/>
My husband is very conservative and not at all ready to embrace the<br/>
idea of unschooling. Some days I still feel the need to be able to say<br/>
we did xyz today. I am working on my husband slowlyas well as myself.<br/>
I would love to homeschool/possibly unschool all my children, but at<br/>
this point my 5yo ds does go to ps kindergarten and my husband wants<br/>
him to go to 1st grade:-(. It took him a bit of convincing just to try<br/>
homeschool in general with Jake. So I am working on him. I feel that<br/>
if we were in agreement about it then I perhaps would feel better<br/>
about letting go.<br/>
<br/>
So there it is, Again I do feel it is an evolution, the stronger I<br/>
feel about it, the more I let go it becomes a part of me/us, I am<br/>
hoping my husband will come to see it too.<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry if perhaps I should not have posted not really ready to<br/>
embrace but I really am learning so much from all of you. To all who<br/>
posted about their dyslexia experiences, I really enjoyed hearing what<br/>
you had to say and knowing you guys are out there!<br/>

<br/>
Maybe you don&#39;t know how really typical this is.  Being sensitive is not a <br/>
symptom of a disorder.  Everyone&#39;s mind wanders, especially children, it&#39;s <br/>
one reason they&#39;re so imaginative, they&#39;re not afraid of thinking.   Day <br/>
dreamers are inventers and scientists.  Really, where do you think new ideas <br/>
come from?  They come from inside the heads of people who aren&#39;t afraid to <br/>
let their minds wander.<br/>
<br/>
***but when he snaps back and he has missed things<br/>
it upsets him. Some of these simple exercises simply help him deal<br/>
with his emotions.***<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible he feels bad because people have pointed out he was &quot;day <br/>
dreaming&quot; and all the negative connotations that can come with that?<br/>
<br/>
And &quot;snaps back&quot; implies one state is good and normal and one state is to be <br/>
avoided.  It would be better for both of you if you could see that the way <br/>
he is is just right, doesn&#39;t need fixing, doesn&#39;t need work.<br/>
<br/>
***To appease my husband ...***<br/>
<br/>
There was a recent thread about husbands and it was suggested that some <br/>
husbands find the writing at Joyce Fetteroll&#39;s web site appealing because <br/>
Joyce approaches things from a logical perspective without a bunch of <br/>
touchy-feely emotional ooze.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/</a>   Will he read <br/>
articles and interesting posts if you print them out for him?   I filled <br/>
several three ring binders with things for dh David to read.  I stacked John <br/>
Holt books on his night stand.   I don&#39;t know how much he really read, I <br/>
suspect at some point he decided it was easier to go along with me than to <br/>
be buried under reading material. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
***I admit part of me is not ready to<br/>
completely let go of that schooly part of me. ***<br/>
<br/>
The longer you hold on to the schooly stuff the more you reinforce in your <br/>
kid that certain kinds of learning are better and more valuable than other <br/>
kinds, and the more you reinforce the belief that learning is something that <br/>
has to be done *to* a child.   You will see learning everywhere once you let <br/>
go of school ideas.  You can&#39;t do both.   You can stay where you are, but <br/>
unschooling will never really take off the way it has for lot&#39;s of families <br/>
if you&#39;re too afraid to close the door on the school.<br/>
<br/>
***My husband is very conservative and not at all ready to embrace the<br/>
idea of unschooling. ***<br/>
<br/>
My husband compared Dylan to himself when he was Dylan&#39;s age and to other <br/>
kids we knew who were Dylan&#39;s age.  David has nephews and nieces close to <br/>
Dylan&#39;s age and their moms really filled David up with news about the kids <br/>
and what they were doing in school.  The hardest times for me were when they <br/>
would come visit.  David would start to feel like Dylan wasn&#39;t doing <br/>
anything.   What changed that was having the kid around. (not the mom&#39;s &lt;g&gt;) <br/>
I invited the kids to stay during the summers.   When David really lived <br/>
with other kids and could see them in the same situations with Dylan he <br/>
realized that Dylan wasn&#39;t behind or missing anything.   The stories about <br/>
the kids in school seemed a little sad to David after that.<br/>
<br/>
***Some days I still feel the need to be able to say<br/>
we did xyz today.***<br/>
<br/>
Some people have found keeping a journal of what their kid does during the <br/>
day has helped.  In the files section of this group&#39;s home page, Pam <br/>
Sorooshian has posted an unschoolers record keeping document.   You could <br/>
print it or look it over and tweak it to your liking and write notes on it <br/>
once a day or once a week and you&#39;d have something to show your husband.<br/>
<br/>
If you read to your son and play games with him and go for walks or hikes or <br/>
dig in the garden or plant a tree or watch a movie or help a neighbor or <br/>
volunteer at the animal shelter or food bank, or go visit the Mayor or the <br/>
fish and wild life biologist or tour the fire station, or refinish a chair, <br/>
or build a bird bath or go fishing, or go dig for crystals, or go catch <br/>
frogs at the creek... you&#39;d have something to tell your husband too. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
***So there it is, Again I do feel it is an evolution, the stronger I<br/>
feel about it, the more I let go it becomes a part of me/us, I am<br/>
hoping my husband will come to see it too.***<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it is a process.  I want to gently remind you that you don&#39;t have an <br/>
infinite amount of time.   Your son is getting older every day.<br/>
<br/>
***I am sorry if perhaps I should not have posted not really ready to<br/>
embrace ***<br/>
<br/>
Your post was fine.  That&#39;s what the list is for!  : )<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1664542536">Thanks Deb lots of insightful helpful things to think about. I really<br/>
appreciate your kind words and gentle encouragement. It is hard<br/>
describe on a list the complexities and personally of me my sons and<br/>
my husband but your advice has been very helpful for my journey.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Some people have found keeping a journal<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I love my friend Danielle Congers Blog and reading about her<br/>
unschooling family life. I have known them for years but oddly enough<br/>
never knew about the unschooling side of them. Reading her blog<br/>
inspired me to start one about us.  I just have to be more diligent<br/>
about keeping it up:-). I will look into Pam&#39;s Journal keeping thanks<br/>
for the tip. I am very lucky to be in NJ where it is a free state to<br/>
homeschool in, so I have not felt the need to document too much in<br/>
that respect. Mostly to document my journey and am so glad I have. I<br/>
like to read where I come in such a short amount of time.<br/>
<br/>
I also have joined Pam&#39;s nomorespanking list as I really am trying to<br/>
change my parenting style. There is a lot ingrained (and dh) in me and<br/>
it is a struggle every day to be more mindful. I find as I change how<br/>
I relate to the children my husband seems to be gentler too. <br/>

If I could give my children anything (one of the *many* anythings <br/>

 </span></blockquote>First of all, try to clarify what you really mean because there are<br/>
contradictions in this post. Have you &quot;tried everything&quot; or have you<br/>
&quot;not pushed the issue&quot; ? Because they are two very different things.<br/>
<br/>
Here at this list, we can help YOU relax and understand how natural<br/>
learning unfolds. We can&#39;t help you teach her to read though...that<br/>
will happen when she&#39;s good and ready. Reading to your child is a<br/>
privilege. She doesn&#39;t need to be pushed towards &quot;independence&quot;...it<br/>
comes with growth and development, not with pushing.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is like saying &quot;My 1 year old refuses to walk and I&#39;ve tried  <br/>
everything.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
An otherwise healthy 1 yo who is &quot;refusing&quot; to walk is  <br/>
developmentally not ready to walk yet. The very best thing a mom can  <br/>
do is back off and focus on what engages the child right now.<br/>
<br/>
The only reason you believe that someone can make a 7 yo read is  <br/>
because schools try to do it. And I suspect you believe, as most  <br/>
parents do, that the 7 yos in school are actually reading. They  <br/>
aren&#39;t. While there are some 7 yos who are developmentally ready to  <br/>
read and do read by 7, there are loads of kids who are going through  <br/>
the motions. The sad thing is that when development kicks in and  <br/>
those kids do finally figure out reading, teachers and parents and  <br/>
kids, are certain it was the teaching that finally worked (or the kid  <br/>
stopped being lazy or stopped being resistant.)<br/>
<br/>
The even sadder thing is that there are kids in school being  <br/>
pressured to read when they won&#39;t be developmentally ready until they  <br/>
are 12 or older. So for 6 years -- if the schools even provide  <br/>
services that long! -- they gaining the impression there&#39;s something  <br/>
wrong with them, that they&#39;re stupid or lazy. (Though some protect  <br/>
themselves by deciding reading and school is stupid.)<br/>
<br/>
The very best thing you can do is back off. To help you not worry,  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have not pushed the  issue but it is getting harder<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What do you mean &quot;let her be independent in her learning&quot;? Is she  <br/>
demanding that she be allowed to learn independently and you&#39;re  <br/>
refusing until she learns how to read?<br/>
<br/>
Reading is only one way to learn. And, depending on the child&#39;s  <br/>
learning style, not even the best. But books are worshiped as some  <br/>
ultimate window on the world and everything else is a distant second.  <br/>
I&#39;m certainly not anti-book :-) (If you saw my house that thought  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t even cross your mind!) But what I am is a supporter of  <br/>
engagement as the best way to learn :-) Whether that engagement takes  <br/>
the form of busy hands, observation, videos and TV, video and other  <br/>
games, conversation, full body movement or whatever. It makes no  <br/>
difference. What does make a difference is the child&#39;s interest in  <br/>
what they&#39;re doing.<br/>
<br/>
We assume schools are using the best methods to teach kids. They  <br/>
aren&#39;t. They&#39;re using the most efficient way to impose a body of  <br/>
knowledge on a mass of people. In order to allow schools to function  <br/>
they must make huge sacrifices in what is best for the child. Even  <br/>
most educators understand that the best environment to learn in is  <br/>
one on one, not thirty on one. But schools can&#39;t do that. It would  <br/>
cost too much.<br/>
<br/>
And at 7 she shouldn&#39;t be learning independently. As an unschooler  <br/>
she should be exploring the parts of the world that interest her with  <br/>
you by her side to point out something else that might interest her,  <br/>
share her joys of discovery, keep out of her way when she needs to  <br/>
explore on her own, help her reach what she&#39;s reaching for if it&#39;s  <br/>
out of her reach, run new things into her world that might interest  <br/>
her (and be cool with it if she&#39;s not interested yet.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-410330676">Hi Bonnie - We all have our ups and downs and bad moments - it has taken me a *long* time to stop harassing them about their rooms and feeling like they aren&#39;t going to &quot;make it in life&quot; if they don&#39;t know what 13 x 69 is off the top of their heads.  <br/>
<br/>
It is hard to learn to trust the child because it goes against everything we have been taught about how to raise children.  John Holt&#39;s books are another excellent resource for helping to see that it is OK to let children find their own way - in one of his books, he specifically talks about how children (or adults for that matter)  learn to read (does anyone remember exactly which book?) <br/>
<br/>
IT&#39;s so hard not to worry - but you may very well find that if you just let it go for now and do other things that she will come back to it when she is ready.  It may also help to remember that many other cultures don&#39;t expect children to read until much later than our expectation is in north America - in France, I have been told, they don&#39;t even begin teaching reading in school until 8 years old - and a significant portion of kids don&#39;t learn to read until they are 9 or 10 or even older - and if they are left to themselves, they don&#39;t develop insecurities about it - it&#39;s the school system that labels them learning disabled or whatever - doesn&#39;t mean they actually are.... <br/>
<br/>
- I admit that I sometimes found reading to my children a chore (I know we&#39;re not *supposed* to feel that way!), especially when it was the same book over and over - maybe it&#39;s OK if you just say that to her - or set a limit that you can stand, (assuming that she&#39;s *asking* you to read to her?) - tell her you are willing to read 3 books or something and then you want to do something else - I think you have that right.  <br/>
<br/>
Does she look at books on her own at all?  Does she like books that are very visual for instance?  You could even maybe say - these are some books for you to look at on your own and these are the ones that we read together - not as manipulation, but to respect your own tolerance level - I mean, we can *challenge* our own tolerance levels, but I think it is also OK for mommies to have tolerance levels!  <br/>
<br/>
Does she use the computer?  When my kids starting using the computer, I categorically stated that they were on their own to figure out the games - which they did just fine; I would intervene if it was absolutley necessary, but I usually couldn&#39;t help them anyway, and i *hate* computer games!  They probably picked up some reading skills that way.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s probably important that you don&#39;t pass on to her a feeling of frustration and impatience around this issue - just let it go, let it be, try to remove any feelings of hostility that you have around it - there&#39;s no telling what they do inside their heads when they sense those kind of feelings coming from us - that is more likely to turn it into an issue, I would think; probably better to relax and let it go.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, and don&#39;t feel guilty!!!! judy <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-778701263">Hi Bonnie.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still new in this group, but I have a 7 year old who I thought<br/>
wouldn&#39;t want to read.  There was no need for him to read.  I read<br/>
everything to him.  Until one day, he got a game manual to help him<br/>
through his Zelda game.  I would read it to him to help wiht his game<br/>
when I could, but I wasn&#39;t up for reading the small print at the crack<br/>
of dawn or while I was driving, so he had a choice...  read yourself<br/>
or wait.  He wanted to know what was on that page.  He figured it out.<br/>
 He reads the things that are important to him.  <br/>
<br/>
My suggestion is to find something that your child is very passionate<br/>
about and share with her.  Sometimes life makes it so you are<br/>
unavailable to read for a few minutes.  Your child may surprise you<br/>
and figure it out herself.  More can happen with less work if you<br/>
wander in the right direction.<br/>
<br/>
I think I was very fortunate to have my boy be the one who was less<br/>
than interested in reading because society told me that &quot;boys don&#39;t<br/>
learn to read as early as girls&quot;.  I didn&#39;t expect anything from him.<br/>
 I hoped that he&#39;d find the spark to motivate him unlock the code. <br/>
And he did in his own time.  Remove your societal expectations and<br/>
enjoy time with your child.  Reading will happen if it is available<br/>
and modeled as something that interests you and provides new<br/>
information that is important to the child.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>
