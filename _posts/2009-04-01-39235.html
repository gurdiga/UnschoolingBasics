<div id="ygrps-yiv-1151662569">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re new to homeschooling (in fact, the kids are still in public school and will be taken out April 24th) and I&#39;m considering unschooling - but I&#39;m having a hard time really understanding what it is and how to do it.  I&#39;m sure you have already had millions of posts regarding this topic, what should I search for to find those posts?  <br/>
<br/>
Also, as I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve also heard a million times, how do you get over your fear of the kids missing something or not keeping up with their grade level (in case they ever go back to school)?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-296083465">Linda - <br/>
<br/>
Best wishes in your new journey! I assume that this decision was prompted by a desire that your children had to something other than public schooling, which is a hard decision for them, I&#39;m sure. <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll likely get a number of replies to your note suggesting things to read or places to start, so I&#39;ll let the others offer that help. That said, I do have three suggestions for you. <br/>
<br/>
First, don&#39;t have too many expectations about the transition - what it will be like, how long it will take, how well your household will adjust, how permanent it will be. Like all changes, this one will have a life of its own - and you&#39;ll add exponential levels of stress if you have rigid notions about how the transition &quot;needs&quot; to go. <br/>
<br/>
Also, you&#39;ll get a ton of advice and suggestions, but in my opinion you&#39;ll be happier if you don&#39;t focus on searching for the &quot;right way to do it.&quot; Unschooling is both obvious and subtle, and there are so many variables that it is bound to look and feel slightly different in each family. There are fundamentals, philosophies, principles - but no road map for right and wrong.  <br/>
<br/>
Last, and most critically, have FUN. Learning in freedom is a wonderful journey, filled with many unexpected benefits if you can trust enough to let go and enjoy the ride. I wish you well!<br/>
<br/>
Jeff<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-98824509"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I&#39;m having a hard time really understanding what it is and how to do<br/>
 </span></blockquote>it.<br/>
Remember when your kids were about 2 or 3 years old - together, you<br/>
explored, asked/answered questions, played, spent time together with no<br/>
expectation of &quot;visible&quot; learning to happen - it was just living loving<br/>
Being...no quizzes, no &quot;standards of learning&quot;, no grade levels. It was<br/>
a given that they&#39;d develop in things like walking, talking, eating with<br/>
a spoon and fork, etc in their own way, at their own time. Project that<br/>
forward...that&#39;s unschooling. To paraphrase a song (Tae Kwon Leep by the<br/>
Frantics) Unschooling is not a road to a door but a path leading ever on<br/>
to the horizon.  When you let go of the idea that there actually is<br/>
something they might miss or that there is something called a grade<br/>
level, then there&#39;s nothing to fear from them - in order to have a level<br/>
or to &#39;miss&#39; something, there has to be the idea that there is a fixed<br/>
package of something that is required or necessary. If I need 2 eggs to<br/>
bake a cake and I only have one, I&#39;m &quot;missing&quot; an egg. Ponder on the<br/>
thought that EVERY college has remedial classes in reading, writing,<br/>
math. 98% of all people entering college went to institutional schools,<br/>
they weren&#39;t homeschooled or unschooled. So, seems to me, even IF a kid<br/>
goes straight through public school, they may still end up needing<br/>
something if they choose to go to college, they&#39;ve &quot;missed&quot; something.<br/>
Heck, there are probably things you know that I don&#39;t and vice versa -<br/>
did one of us &quot;miss&quot; something? Is there something &quot;wrong&quot; with that?<br/>
Or, rather, are we different people with different interests who held<br/>
onto those things that were of interest and/or useful to us. Also,<br/>
schooling has us trained to believe (a) there is indeed a set packet of<br/>
information bits that every person must absorb (b) that information is<br/>
an end in itself. They are both incorrect. Does every person need<br/>
calculus, physics, German, Asian history? Nope. Literacy and numeracy<br/>
(reading, writing, arithmetic) are TOOLS just like a food processor or a<br/>
hammer.  And, in some cases, those tools are just one way to proceed<br/>
with a task. A century ago, information was transmitted on the printed<br/>
page and by word of mouth. That was pretty much all you had. Reading was<br/>
important. If you wanted to know what happened in the Civil War, you<br/>
read a book, and maybe (back then) tracked down those &quot;old guys&quot; in your<br/>
town who were there and talked to them about it. Now, can&#39;t find Civil<br/>
War vets around to talk to (unless you know some folks who are over 140<br/>
years old). And, yes, books about it still exist (and continue to be<br/>
written). But, that&#39;s not it - you&#39;ve got documentary films, websites<br/>
full of photos, those same books on CD/tape...you can see and hear the<br/>
information, not just read it.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the fear of missing something or not keeping up (keeping up to<br/>
what?) just in case they have to go back...do you continually base your<br/>
life in general on fear? Your kids might not live past next week, you<br/>
might not live past next week. Do you want to base your decisions today<br/>
on a fear of something that may or may not happen a year or 5 from now?<br/>
That&#39;s a great way to suck the joy from today when you have your kids<br/>
right with you. Carpe diem.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>*****************************<br/>
<br/>
Worrying about keeping up with grade level can really sabotage unschooling (and other kinds of homeschooling too). It may help to look at all the other things y&#39;all have time for - time together, time to do fun things in the middle of the week, time to stay up all night talking or painting or looking at the moon, time to watch an entire miniseries on DVD. All the things you gain from not being tied down to a schedule and a curriculum vastly outweigh the potential of a few weeks of hassle getting &quot;up to speed&quot; If they ever go back. And a few weeks is likely all it will take. School plods and reviews and plods some more. <br/>
