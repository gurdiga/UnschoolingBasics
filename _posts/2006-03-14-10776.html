<div id="ygrps-yiv-699560978">I wrote a letter to the editor of our paper today about unschooling. They had a unfavorable editorial about unschooling. So since I had it ready, I lifted part of it and left it as a comment on the creepy blog.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1883305934">I went on this site....I cannot believe a person can be busy attacking<br/>
others only because he doesn&#39;t understand.  He took one part of an<br/>
article on another site, completely out of context, and used it to<br/>
show parental neglect.  When will people finally stop condemning<br/>
others who find methods that work to better educate their children? <br/>
I know so many people who utilize almost every form of schooling<br/>
around.  This is because no two children learn the same, or should<br/>
they.  To me, the claim that it is neglect to unschool is no more<br/>
preposterous than to say that all public school parents neglect their<br/>
children because they turn the instruction and care over to others.  <br/>
To me, the key to education for our kids is to be involved, understand<br/>
what your child is doing, and what is going on, and then, advocate and<br/>
help them to find the best way to learn.  I don&#39;t think the author of<br/>
this blog understood that.  At least that was the feeling I got from<br/>
his post.  I could be way off, but I thought we all want what is the<br/>
best for our kids.  <br/>
Sorry I went on and on here.....I got on the soap box...<br/>

I don&#39;t know, but he did make a rude comment at my blog about my<br/>
children working for his!! AS IF! Trevor has already worked (for free,<br/>
in order to LEARN) at plugit.com with one of the techs.  He helped<br/>

 ~Steve has left a new comment on your post &quot;Ptooey!&quot;:<br/>
<br/>
Ptooey is right. I&#39;m stunned and amazed to see what I can only<br/>
interpret as child abuse being glorified. Well, maybe not stunned and<br/>
amazed. I have no problem with homeschooling as a correct response to<br/>
the cesspit of public education, but &quot;uneducating&quot; will have the same<br/>
net result as public schools, so what&#39;s the difference?<br/>
<br/>
I take comfort from the knowledge that if uneducators&#39; kids get jobs,<br/>
they will be working for my kids. ~<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2117225150">This guy really pissed me off.  I usually lurk and don&#39;t speak up much, but<br/>
he really pissed me off and I just had to comment on a couple of his posts.<br/>
Child abuse!!  I am so pissed right now that I can barely think straight.<br/>
(Can you tell I&#39;m pissed? =p)  I pull my 22 yo from school when he was in<br/>
middle school.  He expressed his thoughts of suicide to his youth group<br/>
leader.  I had known he had problems with kids teasing and bullying him.  I<br/>
had spoken with the teachers and the admin of the school, but of course they<br/>
can&#39;t do anything about it unless they see it and then they STILL don&#39;t do<br/>
anything about it.  THAT&#39;S child abuse!!  Story in a nutshell....he was<br/>
Baker Acted because he told an &quot;authority figure&quot;.  Worse experience of our<br/>
lives.  Took him and his brother out of school and didn&#39;t look back.  He is<br/>
now an graphics arts designer for an engraving company and his<br/>
brother (21) is an electrician working on his journeyman&#39;s license.  I also<br/>
have three girls (17, 16, 11) all living, learning and enjoying their lives.<br/>

 I had to post a comment to your blog. Its too much to retype here, <br/>
I don&#39;t think I could recall all the points anyway.<br/>
<br/>
 However on the topic of this guy--, there is a lot of ignorance in <br/>
the world, there is a lot of prejudice, there is plenty of <br/>
negitivity out there too. Each and every person has their own unique <br/>
perspective that makes them who they are. <br/>
 Who cares of one (or a hundred) guy(s) thinks his kids will be in a <br/>
position higher than yours in the workforce. It is apparent that he <br/>
sees his children as Cogs in the workaday machine and that he has <br/>
self esteme issues that relate directly to which position he (and <br/>
the little cogs) posess. People like this do not see the bigger <br/>
picture, their minds are so narrowly focused, so rigid that I pitty <br/>
them.<br/>
 people like this see themselves as &quot;better than&quot; the people who dig <br/>
graves, the people who pick produce, the people building roads, <br/>
people creating art.<br/>
they see themselves as minor kings and queens for which all <br/>
the &quot;little people&quot; work in exchange for a tiny bit of money. (which <br/>
of course they constantly complain about being too much)<br/>
 What people like this fail to see is that the world is filled with <br/>
people like themselves who would be utterly lost without the <br/>
assistance of others. They would go nude and starve because they <br/>
can&#39;t see themselves doing anything like picking produce, weaving <br/>
cloth ect. <br/>
They have no respect for the millions of people who make their life <br/>
easier, all they have is contempt for people unlike themselves. <br/>
and I think that someday that may come back to bite them in the ass.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t be hurt or offended by someone like this, its simply not worth <br/>
your time efort or energy IMO.<br/>
*hugs*<br/>

I just don&#39;t see how he could think like that.  I read your blog and <br/>
was touched by the obvious care you were expressing toward the child.  <br/>
Reading your blog made me feel that your children have lovely lives, <br/>
certaintly nothing like the mini dramas most children go through every <br/>
day in a public school.  <br/>
 The only conclusion I can come to is that he is a boorish pig.  <br/>
Aren&#39;t you glad he isn&#39;t a personal aquaintance? ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1297359293">Ren, <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t post here a lot but couldn&#39;t stop myself jumping in on this <br/>
one.<br/>
We don&#39;t really consider ourselves unschoolers, but I much enjoy <br/>
lurking here and reading what you all are talking about.  We&#39;ve only <br/>
begun homeschooling a couple months ago and I think you folks make <br/>
some good points.  Some of it really makes sense, and I try to <br/>
incorporate it in our lives.  Since we&#39;ve only just begun <br/>
homeschooling who knows where we&#39;ll end up?<br/>
At any rate, I&#39;m sure it won&#39;t surprise any of you that we&#39;ve <br/>
received some flack for pulling our child out of school (the younger <br/>
two are too young to officially &quot;school&quot;). <br/>
I went on your blog and took exception to some of the comments <br/>
there, not just the idea that homeschooling/unschooling is <br/>
neglectful/abusive, but to the very idea that it is treason.<br/>
Despite our best efforts to encourage and shield our son, the public <br/>
school system systematically broke down his self-worth, self-<br/>
confidence, respect for those in a position of authority, and love <br/>
of learning.  We finally decided the only way we could protect him <br/>
from teachers who were teaching incorrect material, telling him they <br/>
didn&#39;t have time to answer his questions, and disciplining him for <br/>
OUR conduct was to remove him from their grimy little hands in the <br/>
first place. (We have teachers in our family and I have respect for <br/>
the profession but not those particular individuals or a system that <br/>
allows/encourages/confines them to act in such a manner.)<br/>
Anyway, I WOULD have been neglectful if I had allowed my child to <br/>
continue being emotionally abused by the system.  In the couple of <br/>
short months we&#39;ve been homeschooling, we&#39;ve already started to see <br/>
him blossoming back into the amazing, intuitive, enthusiastic <br/>
learner he used to be.<br/>
<br/>
The most important thing our son learned being in public school and  <br/>
pulled out of ps is that those in authority not only aren&#39;t always <br/>
correct, but in this country at least, you not only have the right <br/>
to question authority, but the duty as a good citizen to <br/>
respectfully not &quot;shut-up and take it.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Long live Patrick Henry.  Just wanted you to know who posted that.<br/>
