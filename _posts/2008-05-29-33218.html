My dd 11 is interested in wilderness living and I&#39;m trying to locate a place where I can buy flint for her so that she can learn to make fire with flint and tinder.....I&#39;ve found some camping places on-line that sell flint and tinder emergency boxes but it contains a flint &quot;match&quot;.  I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s what she wants.  Does anyone have any expereince with this?  Also, looking for a good book on edible plants.....<br/>

there is a company that sells the striker, flint,<br/>
charcloth, and instructions and if she is teaching<br/>
herself it is worth the investment. He&#39;s currently<br/>

Thanks so much Elisa....Google is an amazing thing....found a company like you described and it&#39;s called Jas Townsend and Son.  The whole kit costs 17$....not bad!<br/>
Off to order it now!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-777572652">My husband just recently did this with my kids.  He saids that he got a flint from wal-mart made by ozark camping supplies and some steel(any modern knife) will work fine for starting a primitive fire.  You-Tube has many videos on primitive fire starting which are more probable to be used in a survival situation since we don&#39;t tend to carry around flint and tender.  He saids also to look at the videos on how to make char cloth to make primitive fires.  My kids had a great time with this.  It was wonderful to watch their faces when they actually got their fires started.  Hope this helps.  Kara<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1679384822">You can get these at a boyscout store.   Call around if you don&#39;t know where one is, usually a uniform shop which sells the uniforms will sell them or know where to get them!<br/>

Happy kindling!<br/>

Where are the &quot;traditional skills&quot; classes offered?  DD11 has gotten her interest from our family camping, My Side of the Mountain, and watching Survivor with me!  ;)<br/>
