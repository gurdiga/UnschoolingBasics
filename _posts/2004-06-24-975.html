&quot;The point of talking about unschooling is to talk about how people learn without schooling.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Pam, this is great! So as a list (not just to you Pam) can we do this? This argument about bedtimes and foods is tiring to be honest. I have seen it on so many lists. I know some people feel very strongly that it is not respectful to limit a child&#39;s choices while others don&#39;t see it that way. Do we have to continue battling this?<br/>
<br/>
As someone said, you can still be an unschooler and limit things in your child&#39;s life, so I would love to get back to the unschooling basics.<br/>
<br/>
How *do* kids learn without schooling? What styles of learning are there? How do you know what your kids know without testing?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Sure. But I need to answer the tooth-brushing question first, OK?  &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
The same way a baby learns to walk and talk without a book.<br/>
syndi<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;...since  we can&#39;t know what knowledge will be most needed in the future, it <br/>
is senseless  to try to teach it in advance. Instead, we should try to turn <br/>
out people who  love learning so much and learn so well that they will be able <br/>
to learn whatever  needs to be learned.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-648244189">the value I see in talking about bedtimes and such is to get an <br/>
ideas and advice (and life experience) about how other unschoolers <br/>
have dealt with things.  From there I can pick and choose what works <br/>
for me...and leave the rest behind.  It&#39;s just useful for me to get <br/>
input from others who might be of a similar mindset.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-763199032">I guess I have more de-schooling to do then... I seem to still think that what we learn has to be measurable in the traditional sense...and I have a lack of faith that <br/>
<br/>
&quot;They learn by playing and making choices and following interests and talking and watching TV and staring up at the sky and swinging on the hammock and picking fruit and petting puppies and helping people and...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
will teach them what they need to do a variety of jobs available out there... then I remember that we are self employed people and hopefully she will be self employed and it won&#39;t all matter... so I guess it is the eternal internal battle I have going on about almost anything:)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the reply... good reminder,<br/>

How *do*  kids learn without schooling? &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
By living and observing and doing and listening. By being interested and  <br/>
facinated and curious. By being surrounded by other like souls (parents,  <br/>
siblings, friends). By being allowed to move at his own pace.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
What  styles of learning are there?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
As many as there are people. But Howard Gardener suggests different  <br/>
&quot;intelligences&quot; that we could have.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
How do  you know what your kids know without  testing?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I talk with them, engage them, do things *with* them. They surprise me  <br/>
everyday with what they know----seemingly out-of-the-blue sometimes!<br/>
