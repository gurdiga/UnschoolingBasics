<div id="ygrps-yiv-1060042335">&quot; I went over and said <br/>
&quot;Hey,<br/>
look at the way some of these pieces of eggshell flew out of the point where<br/>
the egg smashed!&quot; and we really found some super flyer eggshell pieces <br/>
and<br/>
talked about why some of them might have flown farther than others and why<br/>
that yolk didn&#39;t fly anywhere and what it was doing.<br/>
<br/>
It was SO awesome.&quot;<br/>
