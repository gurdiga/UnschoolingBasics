wanted to know, &quot;How will I know I&#39;m in Labor?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Trust me&quot;, I&#39;d say, &quot;You&#39;ll know!&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>For me, it was realizing I would never consider going back to our  how  our <br/>
lives were before unschooling.  More than 17 years ago, I had a brain  <br/>
tumor...very scary and life changing.<br/>
When I first went for a walk outside when I got home from the hospital, I  <br/>
was so amazed that the sky was so blue.  I promised myself to live my life  <br/>
taking time to notice the sky every day. That become such a part of me that I do  <br/>
just that.  It grounds me and reminds me that I am so very lucky to have  had <br/>
all these years to see the sky, and have my children and be present to watch  <br/>
them as they grow.<br/>
 <br/>
Unschooling has been much the same process for me only not so abrupt.   Once <br/>
I got it, it was like seeing the sky for the first time.  I would  never go <br/>
back to the way I lived my life before my illness.  I&#39;d never go  back to my <br/>
life before I &quot;got&quot; unschooling.<br/>
