<div id="ygrps-yiv-1416469779">Hi everybody,<br/>
   <br/>
  Thanks for your replies. Lots of pointers and yes, I supposed &quot;thank god! i&#39;ve only one!&quot; LOL!!! I suppose there&#39;s a possibility he&#39;s an introvert, which explains the preference of being alone and at home. <br/>
  Today was a good day. We got lots of questions from son, which spark off long discussions about the world and planets and the galaxy, in the car, on the way to the park. It&#39;s a beautiful day over here in England today and hubby and son managed to practice hitting some golf balls and we buried son in the sandpit. Today, me and hubby realised there&#39;s a pattern in son play habit- that son always seems to start off playing on his own for a good half hour before joining the other kids. I guess there&#39;s still alot to learn about our son, me and hubby. But un-schooling has begun showing us many positive surprises from our son. It&#39;s like watching him coming alive!!   <br/>
   <br/>
  Hugs and kisses from<br/>
