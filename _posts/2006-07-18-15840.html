<div id="ygrps-yiv-938178595">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Do unschoolers here have ANY rules at your house? Is the <br/>
unschooling<br/>
life a life of zero rules? Or is it not forcing the issue on little<br/>
things like bed times or clothes or how much they eat?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have ARBITRARY rules, we live by principles.  We <br/>
don&#39;t &quot;force&quot; our children to do anything.  We work together as a <br/>
team and because we respect our children and they know that we are <br/>
on their side they are more than willing (most of the time) to help <br/>
out when things need to get done.  We try to help them to listen to <br/>
the signs their bodies are giving them for when they need sleep, <br/>
food, or whatever.  We feel that our jobs, as parents, are to bring <br/>
as much joy in their lives as possible, spend as much time with them <br/>
so that we don&#39;t miss out on anything, be there for them when they <br/>
are having trouble making a difficult decision (ultimately they make <br/>
their own decisions about everything unless I see that they are in <br/>
danger), and really help to guide them as they discover their unique <br/>
purpose here on this earth.<br/>
<br/>
We also try to involve our children in all aspects of our lives, <br/>
including paying the bills, home decorating, and many other things.  <br/>
We just made an offer on a house that my kids were not a part of the <br/>
decision making because they refused to go house hunting with us.  <br/>
When my son saw the house he was very angry because he didn&#39;t like <br/>
it.  It is a fixer upper and we plan on doing all the work before we <br/>
move in but he doesn&#39;t see our vision.  So I took him with me to <br/>
pick out appliances, counter tops, etc.  He picked some counter tops <br/>
out that I didn&#39;t like but we were able to find another one that we <br/>
both liked so that is what we are going to get.  I think the point <br/>
that I am trying to make is that we treat our kids like people not <br/>
like the second class citizens that they are treated like by so much <br/>
of the outside world.  <br/>
<br/>
The thing that I always think of when I am about to handle a <br/>
situation is ,&quot;How would I treat my best friend or my husband in a <br/>
situation like this?&quot;  That often helps me to be a little more <br/>
respectful, especially when I am angry and frustrated.  I also try <br/>
to think of how I felt when I was a child when I didn&#39;t think I was <br/>
being treated fairly and how I would have wanted my parents to <br/>
handle it better.<br/>

<br/>
The philosophy at our home---<br/>
Treat all family members (including animals) the way that you would want to<br/>
be treated. This covers a multitude of areas such as property, feelings,<br/>
privacy, etc. I believe that this is a good basic philosophy for all areas<br/>
of life; marriage, parenting, employment, neighbors, friendships, even just<br/>
driving down the road. I hope that if my children take anything from our<br/>
home it will be this. I feel that helping children grasp the concept of<br/>
empathy far outweighs the benefits of rules. <br/>
