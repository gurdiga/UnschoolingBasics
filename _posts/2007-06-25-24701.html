Laurie, we have a Super Nintendo game (old, lol) that is a Sesame  Street <br/>
game with the Count - it&#39;s erm...downloaded onto XBox, actually, ahem ;)  It&#39;s <br/>
really simple and easy, no great graphics, but helped Julian (4, 5 in  Sept.) <br/>
feel better about trying. It&#39;s not an amazing game by ANY means, but it&#39;s  <br/>
simple and fun and good to help the eye hand coordination. Julian is now really  <br/>
pretty good at Super Mario 3...hey, what about Mario Kart? That was an earlier  <br/>
game for him too, and he did quite well on the first few tracks. We also play  <br/>
Burn Out, lol...which took some getting used to and letting go for me (it&#39;s a <br/>
 car crashing game, that&#39;s the point to crash and stuff) But Mario Kart might <br/>
be  a good one. Also, Tetris is fun if he enjoys puzzles. Dr. Mario is <br/>
similar to  Tetris, so that&#39;s another option there, too. <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m glad you asked, because we are looking for good games here, too. <br/>
 <br/>

You could try &quot;Animal Crossing&quot;, even though it is pitched at an older<br/>
audience:<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Crossing">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Crossing</a><br/>
From there: &quot;Animal Crossing is a social simulator that has been dubbed<br/>
a &quot;communication game&quot; by Nintendo. It is an open-ended game, where a<br/>
player can live a separate life with little preset plot or mandatory<br/>
tasks. There are, also, certain tasks which players can choose to<br/>
complete, and goals they can choose to achieve. The game is played out<br/>
in real-time - observing days, weeks, months, and even years - 29,<br/>
according to Nintendo- using the GameCube&#39;s internal clock. There are<br/>
many actual events and holidays spanning the year, including<br/>
Independence Day, Halloween, and Thanksgiving, among others. Other<br/>
regular activities such as early morning fitness classes and fishing<br/>
tournaments are included in the game as well. Some players purposely<br/>
adjust the clock to skip forward or backward in time, a practice known<br/>
as &quot;time traveling.&quot; Other players use cheat codes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sounds very unschooling to me; I have not played it myself, though I saw<br/>
a kid (about seven) play it who liked it a lot.<br/>
<br/>
One positive review on it as used by a four year old (although with the<br/>
parent helping too, why not try, you might like it too?):<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://rendergaming.blogspot.com/2004_10_01_archive.html">http://rendergaming.blogspot.com/2004_10_01_archive.html</a><br/>
From there: &quot;For the last six days, my wife, daughter, and I have been<br/>
completely hooked on the game. Animal Crossing&#39;s allure is hard to<br/>
describe. It&#39;s a game (if you can call it that) about simple<br/>
pleasures--collecting seashells, fishing, picking fruit, chatting with<br/>
your neighbors, et cetera. It has no conflict to speak of, no tension,<br/>
and no &quot;save the universe&quot;-type goal. It has no plot. It lacks the<br/>
godlike control system and complex customizations options of the Sims.<br/>
It&#39;s Hello-Kitty cute and you can play it for hours on end, every day.<br/>
Needless to say, the game&#39;s been a big hit. More on Animal Crossing<br/>
later. I have to go pry the controller from my wife&#39;s hands and force<br/>
her to eat, sleep, and bathe.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In general I think when a family plays media (TV or games) together,<br/>
some of the bad aspects of them go away. The previous review cited also<br/>
speaks highly of another game -- although clearly played together with<br/>
parent and child. From there: &quot;A week or so ago I finished the Legend of<br/>
Zelda: The Windwaker, bringing an end to a truly sublime gaming<br/>
experience. Windwaker is one of those rare games that leaves you with a<br/>
deep affection for its characters and a real sense of accomplishment. My<br/>
experience with the game was made especially enjoyable by the fact that<br/>
my four-year old daughter, a true fairy tale devotee, was equally<br/>
entranced by its story and characters. Over the last couple of months,<br/>
we&#39;ve had a lot of fun playing Windwaker together, and I believe that<br/>
Link, Tetra, Tingle, and the rest of the Windwaker cast have earned a<br/>
place in her imagination equal to that held by the Disney Princesses.&quot; A<br/>
link for that:<br/>
    <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.zelda.com/gcn/">http://www.zelda.com/gcn/</a><br/>
<br/>
The &quot;Harvest Moon&quot; series is also another possibility, though again<br/>
aimed at an older audience.<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_Moon_%28series%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_Moon_%28series%29</a><br/>
From there: &quot;Most Harvest Moon games are permutations of a central<br/>
formula. The game generally takes place over a set period of time<br/>
(generally 3 years), in which the player is charged with the task of<br/>
running a successful farm, getting married, having a child, and becoming<br/>
friends with the townsfolk. Most gameplay in the Harvest Moon games<br/>
consists of planting seeds to grow fruits and vegetables in the spring,<br/>
summer, and autumn, and collecting items, making home improvements, and<br/>
building personal relationships in the winter. A successful farmer must<br/>
weigh the cost, selling price, number of harvests, and growth times of<br/>
the various types of produce in order to pick the best product for each<br/>
of the seasons. The player must also balance their physical resources;<br/>
if players over-exert themselves, they might not have the energy to<br/>
perform needed activities, or might even get sick and miss a day of<br/>
farming.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have played one of that series &quot;Harvest Moon: Save the Homeland&quot; on<br/>
the PS2 and liked it a lot and think a young child would also like it<br/>
(though I have not see a young child play it, or seen the specific<br/>
versions for the GameCube). You need to be able to read for some of<br/>
them, in which case, a parent or babysitter would need to play it with a<br/>
young child.<br/>
<br/>
For pure addictive non-violent arcade action, &quot;Super Bust-A-Move&quot; is<br/>
nice, with very simple controls, but not sure if a four year old would<br/>
take to it (or should :-).<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://gamecube.gamezone.com/gamesell/p20849.htm">http://gamecube.gamezone.com/gamesell/p20849.htm</a><br/>
On the redeeming side, I do think that does teach some 2D problem<br/>
solving skills though. My wife liked it a lot.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d also suggest some of the Dancing Games like DDR could be worth while<br/>
for both your kids. They involve a mat where you have to make the right<br/>
dance moves.<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ddrgame.com/">http://www.ddrgame.com/</a><br/>
A review here recommending one version for age five and up, perhaps if<br/>
your youngest is near a birthday?<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.parenting.com/parenting/child/article/0,19840,1180502_3,00.html">http://www.parenting.com/parenting/child/article/0,19840,1180502_3,00.html</a><br/>
&quot;Best for young kids (5 and up) is Dance Dance Revolution: Mario Mix; it<br/>
follows the cartoon character Mario as he tries to retrieve his lost<br/>
Music Keys, which will restore peace — and rhythm — to the people of the<br/>
Mushroom Kingdom. Kids are challenged to dance in sync with a song as<br/>
the right moves flash on the screen.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In general, with the Nintendo Wii out,<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://wii.nintendo.com/">http://wii.nintendo.com/</a><br/>
with its unusual controller which requires arm movement and encourages<br/>
getting off the couch to get a little exercise,<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Remote">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Remote</a><br/>
if your kids do play computer games, getting a Wii might be worth the<br/>
investment in the near future for the health of your kids overall if you<br/>
can possibly afford it (it also plays GameCube games and can use those<br/>
controllers). Your kids are literally going to spend hundreds to<br/>
thousands of hours with these games; so why not get them something that<br/>
keeps them physically active too?  Most of the top titles seemed pitched<br/>
at older kids though (7+):<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.commonsensemedia.org/game-lists/Wii-Titles.html#RLists">http://www.commonsensemedia.org/game-lists/Wii-Titles.html#RLists</a><br/>
They do come with some sports games that are supposed to be fun for the<br/>
whole family.<br/>
<br/>
You might ask yourself why your four year old needs to play the games<br/>
alone?  Could a deeper issue be not so much finding a good game, but<br/>
instead somehow finding more help with babysitting or perhaps an in-home<br/>
&quot;mother&#39;s helper&quot; (like a twelve year old neighbor starting out on a<br/>
babysitting career?) while you are off doing other things around the<br/>
house or just to get more time for yourself? Everyone needs such time;<br/>
if you just want the game as a babysitter, then there are other<br/>
alternatives -- some people get it at places like the YMCA which often<br/>
offer free childcare while parents use the facilities (though Y&#39;s cost<br/>
something monthly, typically $60 or so). If on the other hand, it&#39;s just<br/>
because you don&#39;t think video games are for you or you can&#39;t do certain<br/>
ones of them well (you mention that), one can see from the above links<br/>
that playing a game together can be quite enjoyable if it is the right<br/>
game for the two of you, and there are ones that bridge the gap between<br/>
four year old and adult.<br/>
<br/>
As an adult, you don&#39;t have to be intimidated by many of these games. My<br/>
wife and I used to be, seeing young relatives buzzing around these<br/>
games, until we got a PS2 for ourselves while in our late thirties and<br/>
found it not that hard to learn how to use -- especially after we came<br/>
to understand every game has a unique use of most of the controls, and<br/>
learning that is part of the game. (I can&#39;t imagine us having the time<br/>
to play any of these games to conclusion as just a couple now, of<br/>
course; each typically takes thirty to forty hours or so.) Still, we<br/>
could see that some games require hand-eye coordination and speed which<br/>
seemed almost beyond us; those we too generally give up on, and we<br/>
learned to be more and more selective and read more and more reviews<br/>
before investing our *time* in a game. The ones I have listed are not in<br/>
that demanding category though. (Some others we like as adults, are<br/>
&quot;Ico&quot;,  and &quot;A Dog&#39;s Life&quot;, though PS2 only, and not sure about for a<br/>
young kid. And then there is any sort of racing game, like Gran Turismo<br/>
(again for the PS2). There is also &quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot;, which we<br/>
played on the PS2 but is also available for the GameCube -- but it is<br/>
definitely for older kids -- you sneak around taking pictures of evil<br/>
doings related to a conspiracy, and it has a catchy soundtrack too.)<br/>

<br/>
Despite liking console games and the occasional good DVD movie<br/>
ourselves, we&#39;re still keeping our almost four year old away from TV,<br/>
console games, and most of computers (we say TVs are an older form of<br/>
computers which don&#39;t work that well, and only sneak some DVDs<br/>
occasionally on a laptop when he is asleep. :-). Our child does have at<br/>
his occasional request perhaps a half-hour of computer time once per<br/>
week or so with a parent driving a web browser. This is mostly looking<br/>
at Google images for pictures of things (excavators or firetrucks usually),<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://images.google.com/images?q=excavators">http://images.google.com/images?q=excavators</a><br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://images.google.com/images?q=firetrucks">http://images.google.com/images?q=firetrucks</a><br/>
These heavy machinery accidents (no one hurt) are fun for a moment too:<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://humour.200ok.com.au/image_misc-bad-days.html">http://humour.200ok.com.au/image_misc-bad-days.html</a><br/>
A big current interest is &quot;Bagger 288&quot;, which is probably the largest<br/>
mobile excavator in the world:<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://images.google.com/images?q=bagger%20288">http://images.google.com/images?q=bagger%20288</a><br/>
(You can see in a few images what happened when a full size bulldozer<br/>
gets in its way. :-)<br/>
Another good web site is Google maps,<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps">http://maps.google.com/maps</a><br/>
where we zoom around to our house or some other places we know (use the<br/>
satellite view or hybrid view). These are all ways of our young child<br/>
seeing the real world through using the computer as a sort of telescope.<br/>
These activities would not have been easily possible even just a few<br/>
years ago. Our child also plays some of the &quot;Bob The Builder&quot; online<br/>
games and looks sometimes at the &quot;Thomas The Tank Engine&quot; sites. We<br/>
bought books for some of the standard kid shows including Dora the<br/>
Explorer, too; doesn&#39;t know they are on TV. :-)  So, if you have<br/>
broadband internet, and are willing to do the driving, there is a lot a<br/>
young kid might want to look at just using Google Images, Google Maps,<br/>
and a few selected sites, like:<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bobthebuilder.com">http://www.bobthebuilder.com</a><br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.thomasandfriends.com">http://www.thomasandfriends.com</a><br/>
Since both parents program computers at home, it would be too hard and<br/>
confusing to not let our child use computers at all too (otherwise I<br/>
might consider it :-), but we still don&#39;t really encourage it. My wife<br/>
had also written him a very simple drawing program when he was two which<br/>
he played with for fifteen minutes at a time once every couple of weeks<br/>
way back then (mostly drawing colored lines and placing letters randomly<br/>
on the screen); the key idea being for him to get a sense of what his<br/>
parents do and that software could be changed and customized. When he is<br/>
a little older, I&#39;ll be tempted to drag out an old Commodore 64 or<br/>
VIC-20 (if anything still works) and put a Forth cartridge on it and let<br/>
him learn to program his own things. :-)<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://akaimbatman.intelligentblogger.com/wordpress/archives/42">http://akaimbatman.intelligentblogger.com/wordpress/archives/42</a><br/>
But if that old hardware doesn&#39;t work, apparently GNU/Linux has been<br/>
ported to the GameCube, so that could be another possibility: :-)<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.gc-linux.org/wiki/Main_Page">http://www.gc-linux.org/wiki/Main_Page</a><br/>
(but that is probably not a good idea to try for non-programmers. :-)<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.gc-linux.org/wiki/Screenshots">http://www.gc-linux.org/wiki/Screenshots</a><br/>
<br/>
We based this decision to not do much with media at a young age (and<br/>
then, only with fairly slow moving media) on, among other things, the<br/>
research by Dimitri Christakis<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://research.seattlechildrens.org/about/feat_research/harnessing_technology_for_the_benefit_of_children.asp">http://research.seattlechildrens.org/about/feat_research/harnessing_technology_for_the_benefit_of_children.asp</a><br/>
on how rapidly moving discontinuous images in media may rewire the brain<br/>
at a young age (baby through toddler) to crave such constant high levels<br/>
of visual stimulation. See for example newspaper articles on his work:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.usatoday.com/educate/college/healthscience/articles/20040411.htm">http://www.usatoday.com/educate/college/healthscience/articles/20040411.htm</a><br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sptimes.com/2004/04/05/Worldandnation/Toddlers__TV_habits_m.shtml">http://www.sptimes.com/2004/04/05/Worldandnation/Toddlers__TV_habits_m.shtml</a><br/>
One can read the research results one of two ways. Rapid images at an<br/>
early age are bad (because it is blocks out other more important play<br/>
and interferes with usual brain growth), as exemplified by this quote<br/>
from the USA Today article: &quot;Every added hour of watching TV increased a<br/>
child&#39;s odds of having attention problems by about 10%&quot;.<br/>
Or, you can interpret the findings that early media exposure is good,<br/>
because it leads to a new sort of intelligence, a &quot;homo sapiens medias&quot;<br/>
if you will :-) as exemplified by this quote from the same article: &quot;The<br/>
change isn&#39;t necessarily bad, Los Angeles media psychologist Stuart<br/>
Fischoff says. As media exposure grows, &quot;these kids could be expressing<br/>
&#39;the new brain.&#39; They could be an advance guard that suggests we may<br/>
need new ways of teaching children exposed to a lot of media stimulation.&quot;&quot;<br/>
Personally, we&#39;ll let someone else&#39;s kids be the guinea pigs. :-)<br/>
We have chosen to go down one path in regard to early media; the reality<br/>
is most people are choosing the other (or slipping into it unawares).<br/>
Even if the &quot;new brain&quot; becomes dominant, we think there will be some<br/>
value for our child in being in the US minority wired the old way. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Either way, one can&#39;t equate the implications of watching, say, the best<br/>
thing on TV IMHO, Mr. Rogers&#39; Neighborhood,<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.fci.org/MRN.asp">http://www.fci.org/MRN.asp</a><br/>
which is slow paced with few scene changes per minute and has great<br/>
content on emotional self-understanding presented in a caring way, to<br/>
fast paced media (games or TV) with changes of scene and viewpoint every<br/>
few seconds often revolving around violent solutions to conflicts. TV,<br/>
especially children&#39;s TV, is not the same sort of thing most current<br/>
parents experienced when growing up. Only time will tell what the full<br/>
implications are (if any). Same too with video games as they get more<br/>
and more realistic. By the way, you can often get older video games like<br/>
PacMan etc. as either stand-alone TV plugin devices<br/>
  &quot;Atari Flashback&quot;<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_Flashback_2">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_Flashback_2</a><br/>
or as retro game collections for newer consoles (PS2 example:)<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/arcades-greatest-hits-the-atari-collection-2">http://www.mobygames.com/game/arcades-greatest-hits-the-atari-collection-2</a><br/>
or sometimes even as complete remakes, like PacMan for GameCube:<br/>
   <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.the-nextlevel.com/reviews/gamecube/pacman_vs/">http://www.the-nextlevel.com/reviews/gamecube/pacman_vs/</a><br/>
So if there are any games you liked as a teenager, you might be able to<br/>
find them and share them with your child.<br/>
<br/>
However, between TV and games, I would think the games might be somewhat<br/>
less of an issue because the kid is somewhat in control of the scene<br/>
changes in an interactive way and kid games tend to be continuous<br/>
scrolling of some sort like by traveling somehow (which the brain is set<br/>
up to deal with already). Also, unlike TV, most games tend to be<br/>
self-limiting, since kids only stay in an enjoyable sense of &quot;flow&quot;:<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(</a>psychology)<br/>
as long as their growing skills match the growing challenge level -- and<br/>
at some point most games run out of ever increasing challenges and so<br/>
start to become become boring (online games like WoW being somewhat of<br/>
an exception since they better reflect the real world of endless variety<br/>
of new social relationships and such.)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easier to essentially completely restrict media at a young age with<br/>
an only child, such as ours, especially if the parents also don&#39;t watch<br/>
TV or play games much anymore. If a younger kid sees an older kid (or<br/>
parent) in the family using the TV or a computer game, I&#39;m sure it is<br/>
hard to say &quot;wait till you are older&quot;. If I were getting my child a<br/>
console game at age four (who knows, sooner or later I&#39;m sure we will),<br/>
it would be at first something like one of those I listed. From what I<br/>
have read of various consoles (we have only a PS2, in storage), the<br/>
GameCube seems like the best choice for young children, although I think<br/>
the Wii make sense too, and it plays GameCube games, so it is now IMHO<br/>
the ideal entry console for families who chose to introduce computer<br/>
games and don&#39;t already have a console. (We long ago gave up on PC games<br/>
as we had endless install problems and they messed up the configurations<br/>
for other important programs, plus we moved to GNU/Linux and the Mac.)<br/>
At an older age, you can also provide them with some help to write their<br/>
own games, and there are a variety of software packages for that<br/>
(another long topic, barely touched on above). And if my child was<br/>
watching TV (and sooner or later, we will), I would pick stuff like Mr.<br/>
Rogers&#39; Neighborhood purchased on DVD at first, as well as old time kids<br/>
shows (1960s/1970s-ish Green Acres, Mr. Ed, Thunderbirds, etc. which are<br/>
slower paced and generally available on DVD; plus I would not mind<br/>
seeing them again). If we had broadcast cable (we don&#39;t), I would get a<br/>
Tivo-like device and program it to collect such shows. And in an ideal<br/>
world, we would play the games and watch the TV together and also have<br/>
great on-call in-house childcare (but good help is always hard to find. :-)<br/>
<br/>
All the best in finding the right solutions for your child and family.<br/>

for my old brain but he enjoys it and I think it&#39;s pretty forgiving<br/>
since he&#39;s been good at it since he was very little.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1533622270">Thanks everyone for their respones.<br/>
And Paul for your in depth response with lots of ideas.<br/>
He is almost 5 and it is his choice to want to play.<br/>
Like everything around the house, toys, games, books, trampoline, bike<br/>
the kids do something for a while and gravitate to the next thing, in <br/>
an hour, a day, a week.<br/>
This week it is the gamecube.  His older brother and his friends play, <br/>
his older sister plays.<br/>
Last week it was Pokemon cards with his older brother.<br/>
Who knows what it will be the next week.<br/>
<br/>
When I wrote the post he was so upset and discouraged that he wasn&#39;t <br/>
able to play as well as they do.  I was online so I posted the request.<br/>
<br/>
We ended up going to the store and getting &quot;Cars&quot;.  He is so far very <br/>
happy with it and has played several times.<br/>
(and a neighbor has volunteered Dora when he is ready to switch and try <br/>
another game.)<br/>
I&#39;ll be looking for animal crossing, it sounds fun for all of us.<br/>
<br/>
I have been looking for a DDR game--- any advice on where to get it?<br/>
and the best mat to get??<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-782747872">Hi - <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to this group - found it from another unschooling group friend - <br/>
<br/>
My son has a Mario DDR game - and we all love it!  <br/>
<br/>
I got it at GameStop and it was the best price around - but that was last<br/>
year at Christmas - <br/>
<br/>
It was around $50<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-785126572">We don&#39;t have a gamecube, but I do have a young son and a nintendo <br/>
system.<br/>
Ds is 4.5, but is more on par with a &quot;typically developing&quot; 18 month <br/>
old. He gets frustrated with the leapster and the vsmile (both of <br/>
which he could not wait to get). He really wants a game system. We <br/>
went to the store and he just feel in love with the dslite.<br/>
<br/>
So we bought it, and a bunch of games(many gba so he only has to deal <br/>
with one screen but man does he love that stylus). He does ok with <br/>
Cars (he is crazy about everything cars). He played dora briefly but <br/>
has trouble with the coordination of jumping and moving forward at <br/>
the same time.We also have franklin which was ok, and several others, <br/>
but hands down his favorite is monster trucks. <br/>
<br/>
He loves driving those trucks!<br/>
