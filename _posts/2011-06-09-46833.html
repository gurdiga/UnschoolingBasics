<div id="ygrps-yiv-1576295570">I just want to thank Debra, Nance and Schulyer for your responses - it&#39;s easier to respond in one post.  I realize some of this is my issue and my own tension in listening to his frustration.  I need to find a way to let it go.  I know he&#39;s at a difficult age at almost 13 and I do want to just be there for him and provide love and support and the things that he needs.  But it&#39;s just that sometimes the reactions get out of hand.  For example, the other night he was playing and my husband asked him if he could pause the game for a minute so that he could record the baseball game which was already on.  My son got so bent out of shape and said he needed to finish what he was doing.  Well it wound up getting completely out of control between my husband and him where my son was basically having a tantrum and crying and saying we just don&#39;t want him to be happy.  He even went as far as to day he felt like killing himself - this is what scares me.  I don&#39;t know exactly why he had such an extreme reaction but him making such a statement really upset me. <br/>
<br/>
As far as his frustration while playing - usually he&#39;ll either keep going until he succeeds or he&#39;ll stop for a while and go on You Tube to watch the videos about gaming he likes to watch.  He doesn&#39;t consistently destroy controllers or anything.  He did break a pair of his glasses once a while back because he ripped them off his face.  I do realize playing games, or any activity, can be frustrating if it&#39;s not working for you. I realize too that I need to not let it bother me so much.  I guess it&#39;s just hard at this point in time to see that letting him continue to play as much as he wants, especially if I decide to do unschooling, that anything is going to change.  But I guess it&#39;s not something that I will know unless I try it.<br/>

<br/>
This part is not hard! Think about it as a logic syllogism: what you do already know, you don&#39;t like and can see is not working. In fact, you can hardly stand how things are, to the point that you&#39;re searching to connect with real change you can believe in. So in the choice to &quot;let&quot; your lives continue this way or else change, that&#39;s easy, no-brainer! You choose change. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is change, believe it! :)<br/>
<br/>
Whole-life unschooling changes just about everything (why do you think it&#39;s called radical?)<br/>
<br/>
The hard part is changing yourself, not the object of your desire for change, and learning to believe that THAT is what will change everything else for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I realize some of this is my issue and my own tension in listening to his frustration.  I need to find a way to let it go. . . <br/>
But. . .&quot; <br/>
<br/>
So that&#39;s what you need to change first. Thinking &quot;I realize BUT&quot; and then going on and on and on about the child who needs to change and the father-son relationship that need to change, with yourself as a passive listener and bserver (do you notice most of your writing literally casts you as the observer like a narrator or audience member, not as co-star in this real-life family?)<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is not about learning to let it go. It&#39;s about learning how to get up on stage and grab hold! It&#39;s like improv theatre, not better tricks to sit still without complaint in the darkened audience while a tedious show you don&#39;t much care for, plays out before you.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1155509422">Thank you - I realize what you are saying.  If things are not working as they are then change is needed.  And the hardest part is changing yourself. In so many aspects of life it&#39;s much easier for an outsider to see what is happening or what is wrong than you can see yourself.  I know because of my own upbringing and life experiences I am stuck in my ways and I definitely want to break free of that.  Change is good but can be hard to do too.  Of course the rewards will well be worth it.  If I can change and change the things that I am doing then that will all trickle down throughout the family.<br/>
<br/>
As far as being an observer I guess I was just explaining what I see is happening in my home from my point of view and looking for some support from others who may have been through a similar experience.   I believe by reading the Big Book of Unschooling and coming to this group and moving on the path to unschooling I am playing an active part in the dynamics of my family.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1797114351">Please don&#39;t let that be good enough for you, though. I mean this gently but I do mean it: you aren&#39;t playing that active part in your family dynamic right now, at least not in what you&#39;ve described here, and you aren&#39;t (yet) playing an active role in changing that dynamic, at least not by reading and asking about it but not getting it yet.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you&#39;re at a similar point with unschooling that your husband is with college: you each want the best for your son and are trying to figure out how to get the rest of the family on board with that plan? Yet for both of you, the real boy in the present moment is living his life day to day in a reality neither of you support or share?<br/>

<br/>
Let go. Move on.<br/>
<br/>
And why not get another TV and set up for gaming? Search this list for discussions on how cheaply that can be done. Why have the two men in the house squabbling over stuff?<br/>
<br/>
And, btw, nothing will magically change in any sort of big way. Unschooling is a way of life and no one thing will make all of it click. It takes a long-term commitment to living better. <br/>
<br/>
Every time you run up against a situation that is not going the way you want, Dad and DS fighting over TV time, for instance, don&#39;t look for anyone to blame, don&#39;t think about whether or not unschooling is &quot;working,&quot; think about how you can fix this little problem. <br/>
<br/>
Things like this are not necessarily signs of some deep-rooted problem. They are just today&#39;s inconvenience that can be dealt with in a practical, respectful, kind way. Or not. <br/>

<br/>
It can help to replace &quot;video games&quot; with some other kind of activity you would consider valuable and meaningful an re-asess the situation from that perspective. If he had been... writing a magazine article, or deciphering a wiring diagram, learning to play a piece on the cello or writing up a science experiment, would it have been a problem for him to say &quot;I really need to finish what I&#39;m doing&quot;? <br/>
<br/>
If there tend to be tv and video game conflicts, get a tv that&#39;s Just for video games. That&#39;s an easy fix! But beyond that, take gaming As seriously as something You value. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; As far as his frustration while playing - usually he&#39;ll either keep going until he succeeds...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One again, if he were doing something like learning to play an instrument, how you you react to him want soooooo much to get it right? Perseverence is laudable! <br/>
<br/>
It can be hard to listen to someone else&#39;s frustration, though, for sure. My partner tends to cuss when he&#39;s in the midst of creation - the least little error drives him batty and he&#39;ll swear and shout as though he&#39;d just cut himself with one of his tools... I&#39;ve had to learn how to &quot;hear&quot; him without letting my feelings get all stirred up - because really its just part of his process. My daughter will yell at video games and even cry, say she&#39;ll never get it and on and on... but then she calms down and gets back into the game. I&#39;ve learned to make soothing noises but not say too much, as I only add to her frustration. She&#39;ll move on when she&#39;s ready, and get back in the game, more determined than ever. <br/>
<br/>
And then when random people ask &quot;how will kids Ever learn to do anything Difficult if you don&#39;t Make Them?&quot; I think of Morgan yelling at her games and then going back to work, plugging away at something difficult to meet her own, personal goals. She already knows.<br/>

<br/>
This was in a recent post and it stopped me when I read it. It stopped me <br/>
because 13 wasn&#39;t a difficult age when Simon was 13. He&#39;s 14 now and 14 is no <br/>
more difficult than any other age he&#39;s been. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am amazed by that. I am amazed by how when I hear someone talking about the <br/>
difficult age that there child is approaching or is currently aged that I have <br/>
no empathy with that. I haven&#39;t experienced either Simon or Linnaea in a <br/>
difficult age. They have had hard moments. Sometimes there have been really crap <br/>
hours. But a whole year, a whole age has never been something awful. <br/>

&quot;One interesting thing is that the transition from parent of <br/>

don&#39;t think that is generally true outside of unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The connection that an unschooling parenting is working to have with their <br/>
children makes it much less likely that a child will reach an age where they are <br/>
rebelling. If a parent is working on being their child&#39;s partner, not moulding <br/>
their child into something, not making them bend to whatever seems more <br/>
important to the parent, but working to meet their needs and their goals, it <br/>
will go some way to making all ages as good as they can be and few that get <br/>
slated under the category of difficult ages. <br/>

For that matter, why not set up the recording at a convenient time prior to the game starting (both the sporting event and the videogame) given that it&#39;s possible to record things DAYS in advance. And, too, it&#39;s possible to watch the game real time via streaming video on some websites, even if you&#39;ve only got the one television in the household. This is a fairly &quot;typical&quot;/common scenario of the adults&#39; needs/wants have priority over the child&#39;s needs/wants simply because the adult is an adult.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If a child&#39;s been treated with what the child feels is respect, they  <br/>
will be much more willing to set aside their needs for another.<br/>
<br/>
One of the problems with conventional parenting is that adults will  <br/>
encounter what seems to them a grossly selfish reaction by their child  <br/>
as an example of how selfish their child can be. What they&#39;re not  <br/>
seeing is all the times they trampled over their child&#39;s feelings all  <br/>
the years that led up to this seemingly uncaring reaction.<br/>
<br/>
So what I&#39;m saying is that parents should feel they need always put  <br/>
their child&#39;s needs ahead of their own. But the more the more  <br/>
respected the *child* feels, the more the child feels their time, and  <br/>
who they are is respected, the more they&#39;ll react reasonably to  <br/>
reasonable requests!<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that conventional parenting is rife with disrespect for  <br/>
kids. That disrespect is so common that most parents can&#39;t even see  <br/>
it. A good way of being more aware is to ask yourself if this is how  <br/>
you&#39;d treat a friend or someone you cared to maintain a good  <br/>
relationship with.<br/>
<br/>
And the suggestions to think ahead and plan for ways to not  <br/>
inconvenience other people in the family are good. The fewer times  <br/>
we&#39;re inconveniencing others for something we want, the more willing  <br/>
they are to say &quot;Sure! No problem!&quot; when we do have to inconvenience  <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
It *would* be reasonable if my husband asked me to pause what I was  <br/>
doing for him to turn on the recorder. He has in fact. But I he is  <br/>
considerate of my time. I know he&#39;s not seeing me as something in his  <br/>
life that makes his life more difficult. I know he&#39;s aware that he&#39;s  <br/>
asking me to interrupt what I&#39;m doing to help him.<br/>
<br/>
If he treated me like most parents treat kids, though, it&#39;s far less  <br/>
likely he&#39;d get a &quot;No problem!&quot; response from me.<br/>

for me sometimes, but is he being difficult?  No, he&#39;s being four, and he&#39;s a really<br/>
fantastic four year old.  I am difficult because I can be inflexible or invested in<br/>
my own version of a good outcome for him.  <br/>
<br/>
I do think that different ages have their difficulties  My boy is stuck between<br/>
babyhood and kid-hood.  It can be really hard for him to exist in that world.  He<br/>
wants to be taken care of, he wants to be independent, he has big kid feelings but<br/>
still is emotionally a baby in so many ways.  Some days are really hard and some<br/>
days are pure joy.  I agree that there is no one definition for this age, or year.  <br/>
<br/>
I can be difficult as well.  Is this much different?  I can be snappy, tired, hard<br/>
to deal with, entrenched, stubborn, tunnel-visioned.  Downright no fun to be around.<br/>
Should I be labeled as being a difficult age?  If not, why should my children be labeled by me?  <br/>

&gt; &quot;I know he&#39;s at a difficult age at almost 13 and I do want to just be there for <br/>
&gt; him and provide love and support and the things that he needs. &quot;<br/>

&gt; This was in a recent post and it stopped me when I read it. It stopped me <br/>
&gt; because 13 wasn&#39;t a difficult age when Simon was 13. He&#39;s 14 now and 14 is no <br/>
&gt; more difficult than any other age he&#39;s been. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am amazed by that. I am amazed by how when I hear someone talking about the <br/>
&gt; difficult age that there child is approaching or is currently aged that I have <br/>
&gt; no empathy with that. I haven&#39;t experienced either Simon or Linnaea in a <br/>
&gt; difficult age. They have had hard moments. Sometimes there have been really crap <br/>
&gt; hours. But a whole year, a whole age has never been something awful.<br/>
