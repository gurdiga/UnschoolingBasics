<div id="ygrps-yiv-830437295">Date: June 26th to July 1st, 2010<br/>
<br/>
Place: Oka national park & campground, a lovely park just 45 minutes from downtown Montreal!<br/>
<br/>
This is a gathering of unschoolers, where we can laugh and play and have long discussions and take hikes and hang out in the beautiful city of Montreal! This is not a conference. There will not be speakers. There will, however, be as many planned activities as the attendees want to organize, which can be anything from round table discussions, to crafts, games, and potluck dinners!<br/>
<br/>
To have the building entirely to our group, we have to have FIVE ROOMS reserved by MARCH 26TH!  That&#39;s just nine days from now, so please, if you&#39;re planning on reserving a room, do so as soon as possible!  Thank you.  Also, for those who asked, yes, you can absolutely arrive a day (or a few) early, and/or leave late.  There are no special rates for groups on accommodations, so it will not cost you any more per night.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to find out more info, see pictures of our accommodations, etc., please check out the website for this event:<br/>
