<div id="ygrps-yiv-376200724">&quot;Unschooling&quot; is not &quot;technically&quot; legal. I live in Anderson. There are specific guidelines which must be met. For instance, you must document at least 180 school days per year. You also have subject requirements and must keep somewhat detailed records and samples of work in each of the required subjects. It can be done successfully, as I unschooled both my children and am now helping with my grandchildren. It basically boils down to calling it &quot;homeschooling&quot; and being creative with record-keeping.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>States set the laws on education. All states allow homeschooling. As  <br/>
far as the state is concerned, you&#39;ll be homeschooling. (Unschooling  <br/>
is a form of homeschooling.)<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll need to find out how homeschoolers handle the laws. If you go  <br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s a list of support groups. Actually it looks like there&#39;s a  <br/>
statewide unschooling group that&#39;s active:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/schoolsoutsupport/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/schoolsoutsupport/</a><br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ll be able to help you translate unschooling into more schoolish  <br/>
terms and jump through the legal hoops.<br/>
