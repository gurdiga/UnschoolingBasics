<div id="ygrps-yiv-1568299615">Hi Jen<br/>
I have 7 children and was unschooling allof them when the youngest twins now <br/>
6 were only nearly 2.  Bearing in mind they are both severely autistic and <br/>
still in nappies, can&#39;t dress or undress themselves yet e.t.c I understand <br/>
your worries over getting through it with small children.   I would be more <br/>
worried about it if I was trying to do school at home tho lol.<br/>
All I can say is life goes by. Never how you expect, never perfect or <br/>
imperfect but it just goes along. Each day is different and one bad day does <br/>
not mean you will have another the next day. Your girls will grow and so <br/>
will your son and so will you.  I can&#39;t honestly say I have time for me much <br/>
anymore - but if I did I would probably be lost. I do my own thing around <br/>
them - craft, ( mosacing is my thing) art, reading and gardening. They <br/>
sometimes join in,  they sometimes fight and they sometimes do other stuff <br/>
while I a m doing things I like. Other times I have to stop cos they need <br/>
some attention for themselves.  Dh is a house renovator to add to this. We <br/>
never have a tidy house and never a room finished.  We all agreed that the <br/>
older kids go up at between 8 and 9 pm each night to their rooms to play. <br/>
They are not forced to but they see I need time with dh.  This does not <br/>
stopped them coming down constantly for drinks, asking questions and hugs <br/>
e.t.c.  I really, truly believe in the way we live and that has got me <br/>
through bad times.  Winter is not nice - rain and cold and kids stuck <br/>
inside.  Other peoples opinons can be hard to take when you are new to it. <br/>
The good times far outweigh any bad tho. I love my life. The kids love their <br/>
life.<br/>
