<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; all the chores over and over. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I found that the more I took care of messes the more people in turn <br/>
helped me.. <br/>
<br/>
For instance my youngest is almost 3 and she was mad and tossed <br/>
about 20 movies onthe floor. I took her in my arms and was tlaking <br/>
about why hse was upset and my older daughter who is 4.5 said -you <br/>
hold her mom I will pick them up&quot;--- <br/>
<br/>
another time we were walking out the door and the older one tripped <br/>
over the lego bucket and they dumped- we were just going to leave it <br/>
but the little one said she wanted to clean it up - so we did<br/>
<br/>
If you are not MADE to do &quot;your&quot; part and begrudge your &quot;part&quot; then <br/>
everybody does what they want to instead of have to.<br/>
<br/>
I usually do all the surface cleaning but every so often my husband <br/>
deep cleans the kitchen or bathrooms. We each do what we are willing <br/>
to do. <br/>
<br/>
I used to &quot;expect&#39; my husband to help bring in the groceries but he <br/>
did it snarling and acted put out. I realized that this was an <br/>
expectation I had but he did not and so I told him that I would <br/>
bring in the bags and if he felt like helping he could but it was <br/>
not a have to. For a few months he did not help and I did not ask <br/>
nor did I act like &quot;I&quot; was put out or pissed off that he was not <br/>
helping. Then he started asking how many bags there were and I would <br/>
say how many more trips I thought were left and then he &quot;ask&quot; if I <br/>
wanted help and I said &quot;if you want to&quot;. now most of the time he <br/>
just puts on his shoes and comes to help.<br/>
<br/>
I notice that before you give chores kids LOVE to help out and then <br/>
with chores they only want to do the minimal amount of work and you <br/>
have to fight to get it done. We call if &quot;age&quot; but maybe it is just <br/>
because it is no longer a choice but a chore<br/>
<br/>
I was raised to NOT leave dishes in the sink- As an adult i leave <br/>
the dishes for the day in the sink and on the counter and then MOST <br/>
days I do a load but SOME days I wait till the next day. I noticed <br/>
that I do not MIND doing dishes as long as I choose WHEN  I want to <br/>
do them. I hate doing dishes right after a meal- I want to sit and <br/>
settle and after a few hours do dishes.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 I once threw away 4 or 5 board games bc they <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; were left out for days, pieces all over the place - I didn&#39;t want <br/>
 </span></blockquote>to burden <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the kids with cleaning . . . but got pissed and threw them out bc <br/>
 </span></blockquote>(as I told <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; them) I am not their servant.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No you are not the servant but neither are they. If they see what a <br/>
pain it is for you to clean up why would they want to do something <br/>
that you obviously hate to do. <br/>
<br/>
You made a choice to NOT clean out the games and then punished them <br/>
for your choice. I would have dumped them all in a bucket until <br/>
somebody - maybe you- maybe them- maybe grandma- choose to sort <br/>
them. <br/>
<br/>
You are thinking in terms of expectations but maybe it is about <br/>
choosing- you choose to be mom, you choose where to clean and when <br/>
to clean or even if you want to clean. At the moment my toliets are <br/>
growing things in the bowl and I and starting to feel the need to <br/>
clean them (for the record I hate to clean bathrooms) BUT my husband <br/>
might get the urge sooner (which I am secretly hoping for) but I am <br/>
home in the morning so I think it will get done then.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
can you see the difference between thinking you have to and choosing <br/>
to. I clean up for my kids because the sometimes do not know where <br/>
to start or what goes where but they like to sweep and vaccumm and <br/>
dust when the urge hits and sometimes they jsut spontansously clean <br/>
and organize<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How do you suggest going about doing housework as a family in some<br/>
sort of organized fashion? <br/>
<br/>
In September, when we began homeschooling in a semi-structured<br/>
eclectic sort of way, we had a morning routine (eat breakfast, make<br/>
beds, do a rotating chore, reading time, etc.) but since we&#39;ve begun<br/>
making the switch to unschooling we dropped the routine. The housework<br/>
has suffered incredibly. I don&#39;t have the standard of wanting<br/>
sparkling floors but I would really enjoy it if our home was less of a<br/>
disaster zone so we could more freely do projects and make meals!<br/>
<br/>
So, do I start up my own routines and wait for my kids (2 years and 7<br/>
years) to follow along as they&#39;re ready? Or do we set up job lists<br/>
with the older child&#39;s input? I feel we need some sort of system in<br/>
place just to make sure the daily things get done and work doesn&#39;t<br/>
pile up.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-122381524">I don&#39;t expect anyone to pick up my dirty clothes, or my mess in the kitchen after cooking, why should I be expected to do all the chores, especially their messes?<br/>
   <br/>
  *****<br/>
  Do they expect you to clean up their messes, or is that it just doesn&#39;t occur to them to do it?  Would they care if the house was left messy all the time? <br/>
   <br/>
  *****<br/>
  Shouldn&#39;t everyone chip in while in a communal environment (as all houses are)? I&#39;m not a neat freak, I don&#39;t mind clutter or dirty bathrooms - I just resent it when I am expected to do all the chores over and over.<br/>
   <br/>
  ****<br/>
  It sounds to me like you&#39;re the one expecting that someone -- preferably those who make a mess -- should anticipate that it will need to be cleaned up.  If it&#39;s simply that you are the one who likes it clean, then of course you&#39;re the one motivated to do the cleaning.  At their ages, likely the mess doesn&#39;t bother them -- if they even see it.<br/>
   <br/>
  *****<br/>
  I once threw away 4 or 5 board games bc they were left out for days, pieces all over the place - I didn&#39;t want to burden the kids with cleaning . . . but got pissed and threw them out bc (as I told them) I am not their servant.<br/>
   <br/>
  *****<br/>
  Have they told you they expect you to be their servant, or is that a feeling you&#39;ve overlaid on the situation?  Do they really leave all the work to you, or does it just feel that way?  Do you ask for their help before you&#39;re angry about it?  Do they see any joy from you in doing the housework, even just joy in having it clean?  Or is it all made to look like so much drudgery?<br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;ve recently looked -- again -- at answers to the chores question, in the course of a discussion with my mil.  Here&#39;s what I come up with for myself -- I knew when I chose to have kids (I have three total, two still at home) that they&#39;d create messes, and dirty up dishes and clothes, and track in mud/sand and throw shoes about.  That&#39;s just part of what kids do.  It&#39;s part and parcel of having kids in my life.  I don&#39;t really mind the extra work -- most of the time.   Also, it helps to see that my kids do help out.  No, it seldom occurs to them to wash the dishes, tho Andy (11) always brings his dishes to the sink.  Andy will put his clothes away after I fold them, and always puts his clothes in the hamper.  Not because we ask him to, but because that level of organization is part of his personality.  So is having his legos scattered in a somewhat controlled pile on his bedroom floor.&lt;g&gt;  <br/>
   <br/>
  Dan (6) loves to dump his legos -- tho he does always ask first -- take the cushions off the couch, mess up my bed anytime I make it, and almost never returns dishes to the kitchen.  He also loves to scrub the bathtub and shower, mops the kitchen floor, and wash windows, mirrors and walls.  Not necessarily as well as I&#39;d do them, but he loves to do it.  He insists on emptying the cooler on Thurs morning when milk, eggs, etc, are delivered to our house.  He lugs it all in, refusing all offers of help, and puts everything in the fridge. <br/>
   <br/>
  Both boys will take out the trash if they&#39;re not already busy when asked, fight over who opens the carport gate for me, and who &#39;gets&#39; to drag the trashcan to the curb and back. Dan loves to help me bake, and Andy can make a variety of easy foods -- frozen pizza, toast, sandwiches.  Just a few days ago, he brought me a peanutbutter sandwich he&#39;d made just for me, because he was hungry and thought of me!  Both regularly get their own breakfast cereal or a glass of milk from the fridge.  Andy also helps Dan with reading things, figuring out new computer games, setting up shows to DVR, and so on. <br/>
   <br/>
  My thoughts on it are that because we&#39;ve never required that they *do their part* they are more willing to help out.  They see that I/we do the housekeeping because we like things to be neat. I&#39;ve explained that the more help I get, the sooner it&#39;s done and the sooner I&#39;m free to do something with them. When I ask for help, I do make an effort to play to their preferences, to ask only when they&#39;re not busy with something else and to always be willing to hear &#39;no&#39; to a request to help out.  <br/>

<h4>ENSEMBLE S-WAYNFORTH</h4>
<p><small><time>26 Oct 2007, at  4:31am</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-471575203">I don&#39;t think this is a feminist issue. I think it is a resentment issue. It might feel better to phrase it as instructive to demonstrate to your own children how women aren&#39;t the servants in a household, but really what you are demonstrating is that cleaning up is a pain in the ass and can only be done under duress. <br/>
<br/>
At the minute, in my house, the kitchen is fairly clean (it usually is) the living room is filled with the ruins of youtube inspired domino projects and blocks and pocket pets and stuffed animals, one bedroom is completely occluded with toys and another is only partially occluded and the cat box probably needs cleaning. We have been incredibly busy lately and last night was the first night in 4 of not having someone sleeping over. There are costumes to plan and to put together for tomorrow&#39;s party and cookies to bake and bread to be made, I need to get world of warcraft to update on 2 computers so that people (myself included) can play. And all these more interesting, more important things conspire to keep cleaning the house lower down on the list of things to do. When cleaning the house gets to my breaking point, my I just can&#39;t take stepping on toys anymore point I will clean it. And often cleaning the living room happens when I&#39;m watching television,<br/>
 general picking up. Vacuuming is a bigger palaver. <br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, all of that is to say that I can fully sympathize with a messy house. And to set a scene. I can choose to respond to that scene in quite a few different ways. I can choose to ignore it and wait for others to feel the need to clean it, which would probably push me beyond my comfort level and into that itchy, irritable point where I just can&#39;t think quite straight and I feel more and more resentful about and aware of the mess. I can freak out and yell and/or lecture about how I didn&#39;t make the mess and can&#39;t people clean up after themselves, and why can&#39;t they at least use one of the many trash cans I put in a room. I can do what my mom used to do and make them go sit in a room until it is clean, which usually ended up with much of my stuff shoved under the bed. All of those might get the house clean, but are much more likely to make everyone feel angry and sad and hurt and feel like cleaning is a miserable experience that no one could possibly<br/>
 want to do. The option that leads to the best outcome, a cleaner house and happy folk all round, is where I start cleaning and ask for help. Sometimes I get help and sometimes I don&#39;t. I can get really into cleaning, setting up little toy dioramas for Simon and Linnaea to discover and explore, finding things I forgot existed, and so, probably, did they. I like seeing what they&#39;ve pulled out of all of their toys and see where they&#39;ve been (like your 4 board games that you threw away--I would rather save them knowing that they had enjoyed them that day, probably they would enjoy them again). And yes, invariable, all of the work I put in will be whittled away until we are back here with our time defined by the messes we&#39;ve made. <br/>
<br/>
I like to think of my cleaning up as a gift. I like to be able to clear the slate for future explorations in rube goldberg machines or artistic endeavors, or dancing without lego pieces getting stuck to the arch of a foot, or discovering long forgotten toys. Some moments I don&#39;t quite get there. Usually when I am feeling rushed or overwhelmed or tired or pre-menstrual. But it helps me if those moments become just a tidy and not a full involved clean. If I am cleaning for company, I can close bedroom doors and just make the public space as clean as my sense of hospitality requires. <br/>
<br/>
One of the other things you could do is hire someone to come in once a week or twice a month and clean. Surely the amount of money that you spend on a maid service would be worth the peace of mind that you have and worth your children&#39;s peace. You have young children, it seems really unfair to expect them to clean up after themselves. Much better to hire someone to do the work for all of you. And then you can focus on the things you find more joyful in life.<br/>

I&#39;m 100% unschooling when it comes to learning &quot;academics&quot; in its variety of <br/>

For me personally, I don&#39;t have the energy, desire or time to clean up after <br/>
everyone (I have 4 kids btw ages 8, 6, 4 and 17 months, so I am wiped out <br/>
anyway!).  I get resentful when I clean a room only to have it get messed up <br/>
and left that way.  I&#39;m fine with the mess, but not with cleaning it up if I <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1796815457">I can sympathize, being new at unschooling (2 months). Here is my <br/>
report, so far. By chance or grace or re-reading some postings, I <br/>
suddenly *got* the notion of my 10-year old (and only) son needing <br/>
TLC in this time of de-schooling. And maybe he needs TLC just because <br/>
he is my son, and 10 years old, and the world can be awesome for a <br/>
kid. So, I found I was happy to bring him his lunch, and be with him <br/>
more. I am pretty ok with taking his plate to the dishwasher, <br/>
cleaning his misses in the bathroom, picking up his toys. I still <br/>
have a side that says,&quot;Why are you doing this. What about his doing <br/>
his own chores?&quot; So, I tell myself, &quot;Let&#39;s see what will happen if I <br/>
care for him in this way.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What is happening is that he is relaxing more and more, in ways I did <br/>
not even know he might need to. His smiles come easier. His <br/>
appreciation for me and what I do just appear out of nowhere. He <br/>
occassionally helps out.<br/>
<br/>
I think I am seeing a very real display here of how having required-<br/>
chores makes one feel resentful, burdened, less joyful. I do not feel <br/>
burdened because these chores I do are done out of my choice. He <br/>
helps with a smile on his face now.<br/>
<br/>
I was brought up to think that we had to have chores to learn how to <br/>
do them. And, we had to have them so we would learn to be responsible <br/>
human beings. Neither of htose arguements is holding water for me now.<br/>
<br/>
Re:Feminism. I think the word has gotten a bad rap. In my definition, <br/>
it is about being able to be a full person, and I happen to be a <br/>
woman, so that affects who I am, my fullness. Part of my fullness is <br/>
the great privelege of being a mother. I get to define that as I <br/>
define myself. I used to define that, in part, as training my child <br/>
to pick up, clean, etc. In my moments of wider vision, I came to see <br/>
that I was doing that because that is what others did, rather than <br/>
out of my own clear thought. Now, I am experimenting with this new <br/>
way, and finding it way preferable. I choose to love him and care for <br/>
him by cleaning, even cleaning his messes that I used to make him <br/>
clean himself. It is an interesting time, feeling what that feels <br/>
like, seeing what impact it has on him. So far, so good.<br/>
<br/>
I know it must be different with multiple children. I wish you well.<br/>

of not having someone sleeping over. There are costumes to plan and <br/>
to put together for tomorrow&#39;s party and cookies to bake and bread to <br/>
be made, I need to get world of warcraft to update on 2 computers so <br/>
that people (myself included) can play. And all these more <br/>
interesting, more important things conspire to keep cleaning the <br/>
house lower down on the list of things to do. When cleaning the house <br/>
gets to my breaking point, my I just can&#39;t take stepping on toys <br/>
anymore point I will clean it. And often cleaning the living room <br/>
happens when I&#39;m watching television,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  general picking up. Vacuuming is a bigger palaver. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyhow, all of that is to say that I can fully sympathize with a <br/>
 </span></blockquote>messy house. And to set a scene. I can choose to respond to that <br/>
scene in quite a few different ways. I can choose to ignore it and <br/>
wait for others to feel the need to clean it, which would probably <br/>
push me beyond my comfort level and into that itchy, irritable point <br/>
where I just can&#39;t think quite straight and I feel more and more <br/>
resentful about and aware of the mess. I can freak out and yell <br/>
and/or lecture about how I didn&#39;t make the mess and can&#39;t people <br/>
clean up after themselves, and why can&#39;t they at least use one of the <br/>
many trash cans I put in a room. I can do what my mom used to do and <br/>
make them go sit in a room until it is clean, which usually ended up <br/>
with much of my stuff shoved under the bed. All of those might get <br/>
the house clean, but are much more likely to make everyone feel angry <br/>
and sad and hurt and feel like cleaning is a miserable experience <br/>
that no one could possibly<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  want to do. The option that leads to the best outcome, a cleaner <br/>
 </span></blockquote>house and happy folk all round, is where I start cleaning and ask for <br/>
help. Sometimes I get help and sometimes I don&#39;t. I can get really <br/>
into cleaning, setting up little toy dioramas for Simon and Linnaea <br/>
to discover and explore, finding things I forgot existed, and so, <br/>
probably, did they. I like seeing what they&#39;ve pulled out of all of <br/>
their toys and see where they&#39;ve been (like your 4 board games that <br/>
you threw away--I would rather save them knowing that they had <br/>
enjoyed them that day, probably they would enjoy them again). And <br/>
yes, invariable, all of the work I put in will be whittled away until <br/>
we are back here with our time defined by the messes we&#39;ve made. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I like to think of my cleaning up as a gift. I like to be able to <br/>

I don&#39;t quite get there. Usually when I am feeling rushed or <br/>
overwhelmed or tired or pre-menstrual. But it helps me if those <br/>
moments become just a tidy and not a full involved clean. If I am <br/>
cleaning for company, I can close bedroom doors and just make the <br/>
public space as clean as my sense of hospitality requires. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

that you spend on a maid service would be worth the peace of mind <br/>
that you have and worth your children&#39;s peace. You have young <br/>
children, it seems really unfair to expect them to clean up after <br/>
themselves. Much better to hire someone to do the work for all of <br/>
you. And then you can focus on the things you find more joyful in <br/>
life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-414845776">~~I used to &quot;expect&#39; my husband to help bring in the groceries but he<br/>
did it snarling and acted put out. ~~<br/>
<br/>
I used to expect it and when he didn&#39;t jump up as soon as I walked in<br/>
the door I felt resentful. He didn&#39;t even realize that was a token of<br/>
caring in my mind. I thought he was really being a jerk letting me<br/>
carry all those groceries in myself.<br/>
<br/>
When I finally expressed how it felt, he was surprised. When I get<br/>
home with groceries now (if he or the kids aren&#39;t with me) I yell out<br/>
&quot;hey, I could use some help with these groceries&quot; or &quot;Could everyone<br/>
come grab a couple bags please?&quot; and it&#39;s amazing how much help I get! <br/>
<br/>
I know we can make other choices than resentment. Expectations can get<br/>
in the way of reality. I&#39;m learning repeatedly, that a joyful, kind<br/>
person gets more help than a resentful, grumpy person.:) Smart people<br/>
that they are, they learn to avoid a nasty grump.<br/>

<br/>
What are your thoughts or opinions?~~<br/>
<br/>
You asked.:)<br/>
<br/>
My first thought is that you should have thought about the extra mess<br/>
and work before you had kids! ;) Having children means accepting a LOT<br/>
of extra inconvenience, mess and chaos. Expecting them to understand<br/>
an adult need for order is setting yourself up for some really<br/>
negative energy.<br/>
<br/>
Throwing out games seems pretty cruel to me. Maybe the kids would have<br/>
been happy to sort them out at a later time. Maybe they wanted to play<br/>
with them in a different way, with all the pieces combined. Maybe it<br/>
didn&#39;t seem stressful or messy to them at all. Why shouldn&#39;t their way<br/>
be honored? Those games could have been thrown into a bin and a choice<br/>
made about it later. It could have led to some really fun sorting time<br/>
together...laughter, talking etc...while everyone put them back.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about connections and if you&#39;re feeling like a servant, that will<br/>
really short circuit connection time.<br/>
<br/>
In unschooling, the priority is healthy relationships. If that is the<br/>
goal, it changes every interaction, every choice. Choosing to make a<br/>
happy home, choosing to provide order for the sake of everyone in the<br/>
family is not being a servant. It is service though. The difference is<br/>
that a servant has little choice in the matter. You have a choice. <br/>
<br/>
Choosing joy and service over resentment will probably lead to more<br/>
help in the long run. It will definitely lead to less stressful<br/>
interactions.<br/>

&gt;I don&#39;t expect anyone to pick up my dirty clothes, or my mess in the <br/>
&gt;kitchen after cooking, why should I be expected to do all the chores, <br/>
&gt;especially their messes?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  *****<br/>
&gt;  Do they expect you to clean up their messes, or is that it just doesn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; occur to them to do it?  Would they care if the house was left messy all <br/>
&gt; the time?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  *****<br/>
&gt;  Shouldn&#39;t everyone chip in while in a communal environment (as all houses <br/>
&gt; are)? I&#39;m not a neat freak, I don&#39;t mind clutter or dirty bathrooms - I <br/>
&gt; just resent it when I am expected to do all the chores over and over.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  ****<br/>
&gt;  It sounds to me like you&#39;re the one expecting that someone -- preferably <br/>
&gt; those who make a mess -- should anticipate that it will need to be cleaned <br/>
&gt; up.  If it&#39;s simply that you are the one who likes it clean, then of <br/>
&gt; course you&#39;re the one motivated to do the cleaning.  At their ages, likely <br/>
&gt; the mess doesn&#39;t bother them -- if they even see it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  *****<br/>
&gt;  I once threw away 4 or 5 board games bc they were left out for days, <br/>
&gt; pieces all over the place - I didn&#39;t want to burden the kids with cleaning <br/>
&gt; . . . but got pissed and threw them out bc (as I told them) I am not their <br/>
&gt; servant.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  *****<br/>
&gt;  Have they told you they expect you to be their servant, or is that a <br/>
&gt; feeling you&#39;ve overlaid on the situation?  Do they really leave all the <br/>
&gt; work to you, or does it just feel that way?  Do you ask for their help <br/>

&gt; housework, even just joy in having it clean?  Or is it all made to look <br/>
&gt; like so much drudgery?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  I&#39;ve recently looked -- again -- at answers to the chores question, in <br/>
&gt; the course of a discussion with my mil.  Here&#39;s what I come up with for <br/>
&gt; myself -- I knew when I chose to have kids (I have three total, two still <br/>
&gt; at home) that they&#39;d create messes, and dirty up dishes and clothes, and <br/>
&gt; track in mud/sand and throw shoes about.  That&#39;s just part of what kids <br/>
&gt; do.  It&#39;s part and parcel of having kids in my life.  I don&#39;t really mind <br/>
&gt; the extra work -- most of the time.   Also, it helps to see that my kids <br/>
&gt; do help out.  No, it seldom occurs to them to wash the dishes, tho Andy <br/>
&gt; (11) always brings his dishes to the sink.  Andy will put his clothes away <br/>
&gt; after I fold them, and always puts his clothes in the hamper.  Not because <br/>
&gt; we ask him to, but because that level of organization is part of his <br/>
&gt; personality.  So is having his legos scattered in a somewhat controlled <br/>
&gt; pile on his bedroom floor.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Dan (6) loves to dump his legos -- tho he does always ask first -- take <br/>
&gt; the cushions off the couch, mess up my bed anytime I make it, and almost <br/>
&gt; never returns dishes to the kitchen.  He also loves to scrub the bathtub <br/>
&gt; and shower, mops the kitchen floor, and wash windows, mirrors and walls. <br/>
&gt; Not necessarily as well as I&#39;d do them, but he loves to do it.  He insists <br/>
&gt; on emptying the cooler on Thurs morning when milk, eggs, etc, are <br/>
&gt; delivered to our house.  He lugs it all in, refusing all offers of help, <br/>
&gt; and puts everything in the fridge.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Both boys will take out the trash if they&#39;re not already busy when asked, <br/>
&gt; fight over who opens the carport gate for me, and who &#39;gets&#39; to drag the <br/>
&gt; trashcan to the curb and back. Dan loves to help me bake, and Andy can <br/>
&gt; make a variety of easy foods -- frozen pizza, toast, sandwiches.  Just a <br/>
&gt; few days ago, he brought me a peanutbutter sandwich he&#39;d made just for me, <br/>
&gt; because he was hungry and thought of me!  Both regularly get their own <br/>
&gt; breakfast cereal or a glass of milk from the fridge.  Andy also helps Dan <br/>
&gt; with reading things, figuring out new computer games, setting up shows to <br/>
&gt; DVR, and so on.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  My thoughts on it are that because we&#39;ve never required that they *do <br/>
&gt; their part* they are more willing to help out.  They see that I/we do the <br/>
&gt; housekeeping because we like things to be neat. I&#39;ve explained that the <br/>
&gt; more help I get, the sooner it&#39;s done and the sooner I&#39;m free to do <br/>
&gt; something with them. When I ask for help, I do make an effort to play to <br/>
&gt; their preferences, to ask only when they&#39;re not busy with something else <br/>
&gt; and to always be willing to hear &#39;no&#39; to a request to help out.<br/>

they can do whatever to the other half).<br/>

We don&#39;t do chores - the only time I do anything to their rooms is when the <br/>

they want to keep and we throw away the rest.  We do it together, 2 or 3 <br/>

to take care of their part of what they mess up.<br/>

&gt;I don&#39;t think this is a feminist issue. I think it is a resentment issue. <br/>
&gt;It might feel better to phrase it as instructive to demonstrate to your own <br/>
&gt;children how women aren&#39;t the servants in a household, but really what you <br/>
&gt;are demonstrating is that cleaning up is a pain in the ass and can only be <br/>
&gt;done under duress.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At the minute, in my house, the kitchen is fairly clean (it usually is) <br/>
&gt; the living room is filled with the ruins of youtube inspired domino <br/>
&gt; projects and blocks and pocket pets and stuffed animals, one bedroom is <br/>
&gt; completely occluded with toys and another is only partially occluded and <br/>
&gt; the cat box probably needs cleaning. We have been incredibly busy lately <br/>
&gt; and last night was the first night in 4 of not having someone sleeping <br/>
&gt; over. There are costumes to plan and to put together for tomorrow&#39;s party <br/>
&gt; and cookies to bake and bread to be made, I need to get world of warcraft <br/>
&gt; to update on 2 computers so that people (myself included) can play. And <br/>
&gt; all these more interesting, more important things conspire to keep <br/>
&gt; cleaning the house lower down on the list of things to do. When cleaning <br/>
&gt; the house gets to my breaking point, my I just can&#39;t take stepping on toys <br/>
&gt; anymore point I will clean it. And often cleaning the living room happens <br/>
&gt; when I&#39;m watching television,<br/>
&gt; general picking up. Vacuuming is a bigger palaver.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyhow, all of that is to say that I can fully sympathize with a messy <br/>
&gt; house. And to set a scene. I can choose to respond to that scene in quite <br/>
&gt; a few different ways. I can choose to ignore it and wait for others to <br/>
&gt; feel the need to clean it, which would probably push me beyond my comfort <br/>
&gt; level and into that itchy, irritable point where I just can&#39;t think quite <br/>
&gt; straight and I feel more and more resentful about and aware of the mess. I <br/>
&gt; can freak out and yell and/or lecture about how I didn&#39;t make the mess and <br/>
&gt; can&#39;t people clean up after themselves, and why can&#39;t they at least use <br/>
&gt; one of the many trash cans I put in a room. I can do what my mom used to <br/>
&gt; do and make them go sit in a room until it is clean, which usually ended <br/>
&gt; up with much of my stuff shoved under the bed. All of those might get the <br/>
&gt; house clean, but are much more likely to make everyone feel angry and sad <br/>
&gt; and hurt and feel like cleaning is a miserable experience that no one <br/>
&gt; could possibly<br/>
&gt; want to do. The option that leads to the best outcome, a cleaner house and <br/>
&gt; happy folk all round, is where I start cleaning and ask for help. <br/>
&gt; Sometimes I get help and sometimes I don&#39;t. I can get really into <br/>
&gt; cleaning, setting up little toy dioramas for Simon and Linnaea to discover <br/>
&gt; and explore, finding things I forgot existed, and so, probably, did they. <br/>
&gt; I like seeing what they&#39;ve pulled out of all of their toys and see where <br/>
&gt; they&#39;ve been (like your 4 board games that you threw away--I would rather <br/>
&gt; save them knowing that they had enjoyed them that day, probably they would <br/>
&gt; enjoy them again). And yes, invariable, all of the work I put in will be <br/>
&gt; whittled away until we are back here with our time defined by the messes <br/>
&gt; we&#39;ve made.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I like to think of my cleaning up as a gift. I like to be able to clear <br/>
&gt; the slate for future explorations in rube goldberg machines or artistic <br/>
&gt; endeavors, or dancing without lego pieces getting stuck to the arch of a <br/>
&gt; foot, or discovering long forgotten toys. Some moments I don&#39;t quite get <br/>
&gt; there. Usually when I am feeling rushed or overwhelmed or tired or <br/>
&gt; pre-menstrual. But it helps me if those moments become just a tidy and not <br/>
&gt; a full involved clean. If I am cleaning for company, I can close bedroom <br/>
&gt; doors and just make the public space as clean as my sense of hospitality <br/>
&gt; requires.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One of the other things you could do is hire someone to come in once a <br/>
&gt; week or twice a month and clean. Surely the amount of money that you spend <br/>
&gt; on a maid service would be worth the peace of mind that you have and worth <br/>
&gt; your children&#39;s peace. You have young children, it seems really unfair to <br/>
&gt; expect them to clean up after themselves. Much better to hire someone to <br/>
&gt; do the work for all of you. And then you can focus on the things you find <br/>
&gt; more joyful in life.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m 100% unschooling when it comes to learning &quot;academics&quot; in its variety <br/>

&gt; unschooling like chores.  My mom was the type who did everything for my <br/>
&gt; dad<br/>
&gt; and my brother and I.  As I got older I hated seeing her being treated as <br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; traditional housewife, who kept the house and catered to everyone in it,<br/>
&gt; simply bc she was a woman.   I don&#39;t want my girls to think they will be<br/>

&gt; don&#39;t want my son to expect that role from his wife should he decide to<br/>
&gt; marry.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For me personally, I don&#39;t have the energy, desire or time to clean up <br/>
&gt; after<br/>
&gt; everyone (I have 4 kids btw ages 8, 6, 4 and 17 months, so I am wiped out<br/>
&gt; anyway!).  I get resentful when I clean a room only to have it get messed <br/>
&gt; up<br/>
&gt; and left that way.  I&#39;m fine with the mess, but not with cleaning it up if <br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t make it.  I don&#39;t expect anyone to pick up my dirty clothes, or my<br/>
&gt; mess in the kitchen after cooking, why should I be expected to do all the<br/>
&gt; chores, especially their messes?  Shouldn&#39;t everyone chip in while in a<br/>
&gt; communal environment (as all houses are)?  I&#39;m not a neat freak, I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; mind clutter or dirty bathrooms - I just resent it when I am expected to <br/>
&gt; do<br/>
&gt; all the chores over and over.  I once threw away 4 or 5 board games bc <br/>
&gt; they<br/>
&gt; were left out for days, pieces all over the place - I didn&#39;t want to <br/>
&gt; burden<br/>
&gt; the kids with cleaning . . . but got pissed and threw them out bc (as I <br/>
&gt; told<br/>
&gt; them) I am not their servant.<br/>

cleaning every now and then.  And once I started driving, I did the grocery <br/>
shopping which I really enjoyed.  My mom worked and I know she appreciated <br/>
that.  But laundry, ironing and keeping the house clean all the time was on <br/>
my mom.  We had a couch in the living room that no one was allowed to sit <br/>
on - it was to be kept nice.   I don&#39;t wish these things on my kids and try, <br/>

&gt; don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;&gt; mind clutter or dirty bathrooms - I just resent it when I am<br/>
&gt; expected to do<br/>
&gt;&gt; all the chores over and over.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I found that the more I took care of messes the more people in turn<br/>
&gt; helped me..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For instance my youngest is almost 3 and she was mad and tossed<br/>
&gt; about 20 movies onthe floor. I took her in my arms and was tlaking<br/>
&gt; about why hse was upset and my older daughter who is 4.5 said -you<br/>
&gt; hold her mom I will pick them up&quot;--- <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; another time we were walking out the door and the older one tripped<br/>
&gt; over the lego bucket and they dumped- we were just going to leave it<br/>
&gt; but the little one said she wanted to clean it up - so we did<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you are not MADE to do &quot;your&quot; part and begrudge your &quot;part&quot; then<br/>
&gt; everybody does what they want to instead of have to.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I usually do all the surface cleaning but every so often my husband<br/>
&gt; deep cleans the kitchen or bathrooms. We each do what we are willing<br/>
&gt; to do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I used to &quot;expect&#39; my husband to help bring in the groceries but he<br/>
&gt; did it snarling and acted put out. I realized that this was an<br/>
&gt; expectation I had but he did not and so I told him that I would<br/>
&gt; bring in the bags and if he felt like helping he could but it was<br/>
&gt; not a have to. For a few months he did not help and I did not ask<br/>
&gt; nor did I act like &quot;I&quot; was put out or pissed off that he was not<br/>
&gt; helping. Then he started asking how many bags there were and I would<br/>
&gt; say how many more trips I thought were left and then he &quot;ask&quot; if I<br/>
&gt; wanted help and I said &quot;if you want to&quot;. now most of the time he<br/>
&gt; just puts on his shoes and comes to help.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I notice that before you give chores kids LOVE to help out and then<br/>
&gt; with chores they only want to do the minimal amount of work and you<br/>
&gt; have to fight to get it done. We call if &quot;age&quot; but maybe it is just<br/>
&gt; because it is no longer a choice but a chore<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was raised to NOT leave dishes in the sink- As an adult i leave<br/>
&gt; the dishes for the day in the sink and on the counter and then MOST<br/>
&gt; days I do a load but SOME days I wait till the next day. I noticed<br/>
&gt; that I do not MIND doing dishes as long as I choose WHEN  I want to<br/>
&gt; do them. I hate doing dishes right after a meal- I want to sit and<br/>
&gt; settle and after a few hours do dishes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I once threw away 4 or 5 board games bc they<br/>
&gt;&gt; were left out for days, pieces all over the place - I didn&#39;t want<br/>
&gt; to burden<br/>
&gt;&gt; the kids with cleaning . . . but got pissed and threw them out bc<br/>
&gt; (as I told<br/>
&gt;&gt; them) I am not their servant.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; No you are not the servant but neither are they. If they see what a<br/>
&gt; pain it is for you to clean up why would they want to do something<br/>
&gt; that you obviously hate to do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You made a choice to NOT clean out the games and then punished them<br/>
&gt; for your choice. I would have dumped them all in a bucket until<br/>
&gt; somebody - maybe you- maybe them- maybe grandma- choose to sort<br/>
&gt; them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You are thinking in terms of expectations but maybe it is about<br/>
&gt; choosing- you choose to be mom, you choose where to clean and when<br/>
&gt; to clean or even if you want to clean. At the moment my toliets are<br/>
&gt; growing things in the bowl and I and starting to feel the need to<br/>
&gt; clean them (for the record I hate to clean bathrooms) BUT my husband<br/>
&gt; might get the urge sooner (which I am secretly hoping for) but I am<br/>
&gt; home in the morning so I think it will get done then.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; can you see the difference between thinking you have to and choosing<br/>
&gt; to. I clean up for my kids because the sometimes do not know where<br/>
&gt; to start or what goes where but they like to sweep and vaccumm and<br/>
&gt; dust when the urge hits and sometimes they jsut spontansously clean<br/>
&gt; and organize<br/>

the housework. Maybe don&#39;t &quot;let it go&quot; so long - it sounds as if you&#39;re<br/>
waiting and waiting (picture folded arms and tapping foot) until they<br/>
&quot;realize&quot; they &quot;should&quot; do something and it gets more and more out of<br/>
hand until finally you go ahead and &quot;give in&quot; and take care of it. How<br/>
about just doing what you see when you see it - a little here and there,<br/>
15 minutes in the kitchen then go do something else - watch TV, read,<br/>
knit, whatever - then 15 minutes in the living room and so on - rather<br/>
than waiting to see IF they are going to &quot;finally take responsibility<br/>
for their own messes&quot;. As others said, maybe it&#39;s a change of those old<br/>
tapes in your head that are still playing and seeing everything you do<br/>
(or don&#39;t do) as YOUR choice. You can choose when and how and all to do<br/>
something. You can choose to resent them not helping or choose to ask<br/>
for assistance. The key to asking for assistance is making it a bit open<br/>
ended - that is, if you ask for the socks to be picked up off the living<br/>
room floor, do it with the expectation that it will get done *sometime*,<br/>
but not *necessarily* the very minute you ask. I&#39;ve found it comes out<br/>
way better if I ask DS (9 yrs) &quot;Hey, can you get the shoes rounded up at<br/>
the next commercial break?&quot; (or when you finish this level or when<br/>
you&#39;ve finished assembling that k&#39;nex invention...) rather than stating<br/>
and/or expecting him to stop what he&#39;s doing *immediately* to do what<br/>
I&#39;ve asked.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1569232406">I haven&#39;t read all of the responses yet, but I&#39;ll tell you what I did. I  <br/>
used to do the chore charts, threats, punishments, bribes. You name it, I did  <br/>
it. <br/>
 <br/>
Now, I ask for help. It&#39;s amazing how much my children want to spend time  <br/>
with me. They also love to make mommy happy. I&#39;m amazed daily at the amount of  <br/>
love these children feel for me. I typically just say, &quot;I&#39;m going to tidy the  <br/>
upstairs and dust. Do you want to work with me?&quot; If they say no, I go to my  <br/>
other child and ask them. If both children say no, I do the job myself. I act  <br/>
joyful while cleaning (music on, dancing, singing, smiling). If a child <br/>
chooses  to help, this child gets my full attention while helping me. It&#39;s not an  <br/>
artificial bribe~just the nature of working with mom. This is often what  the <br/>
children want from their parents. They want our time and attention. <br/>
 <br/>
When I started doing this, they said no more often. They wanted to know  that <br/>
they could say no without my getting mad. Now that they know it really is <br/>
their choice, they often say yes. It&#39;s more work in the beginning than  making a <br/>
chore chart, but in the long run, it works much better. The children  also <br/>
learn to clean better by seeing your example. I don&#39;t have problems with  two <br/>
children, but with four children, you may have to turn away help!  <br/>

How do  you suggest going about doing housework as a family in some<br/>
sort of  organized fashion? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Kim,<br/>
You could set up a schedule for yourself. Fill in the basics that need to  be <br/>
accomplished. Your children are still relatively young and would not be a  <br/>
great help at this age. Like I posted earlier, cheerfully do your scheduled  <br/>
chores and ask for help. If your child(ren) says yes, than you can accomplish  <br/>
your task faster or you can get more done. If not, you still have the basics  <br/>
done. If your child sees the blessing of spending time with you and having fun  <br/>
with you, they will be more willing. This is a great time to teach your <br/>
children  how to clean a toilet, or how to sweep the floor. Your child may <br/>
eventually be  more willing to work on their own, but if not, working together is still <br/>
a great  way to accomplish tasks. &quot;Many hands make light work.&quot;  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1249860063">Delurking for this one,<br/>
<br/>
Deb wrote pretty much what I was thinking.  When we transitioned to<br/>
RUing the chore issue took a little longer to settle in my mind than the<br/>
academics shift .<br/>
<br/>
What helped me was looking closely at and changing on my own attitude<br/>
towards housework.  I decided that I needed to own my own standards.<br/>
They were MY standards and I needed to take responsibility for them, not<br/>
hoist them onto my family.  I stopped expecting. I stopped expecting my<br/>
kids to have my same standards. I stopped expecting them to live up to<br/>
my standards.  Letting go of expectations was the key to my shift in<br/>
attitude.<br/>
<br/>
Looking back on it I think that there had to be a period of absolutely<br/>
no expectations or even requests for help - a de-choring if you will -<br/>
before my kids believed that any housework they did would be of their<br/>
own free will.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m explaining this clearly. For me, I needed to release<br/>
all expectations and hopes that my kids would voluntarily pitch-in with<br/>
housework. I needed to do it cheerfully myself and let all resentment<br/>
evaporate.  During that time I routinely and intentionally swept through<br/>
the house, including their bedrooms, and picked-up dirty dishes, took<br/>
out their trash, hauled out their dirty laundry etc. with a spirit of<br/>
generosity and love for the awesome people I&#39;d chosen to bring into this<br/>
world.<br/>
<br/>
It took some time but eventually my kids started to offer assistance or<br/>
do little things here and there without my asking. In the last year or<br/>
so I can now ask (always open-ended) for help and they usually oblige my<br/>
requests. I am careful not to abuse their generosity because I know that<br/>
my standards of clean are beyond theirs. Cleaning up can quickly go from<br/>
mutually satisfying to trying to satisfy mom if I&#39;m not careful.<br/>
<br/>
I  try to always be respectful of their time and plans or activities and<br/>
let them know that if they are busy and don&#39;t want to break away, that<br/>
the task can either wait or I&#39;ll get to it soon enough.<br/>
<br/>
My 16yo routinely takes the trash and recycling out each week. His<br/>
father will sometimes remind him, &quot;Remember, you HAVE to take the trash<br/>
out tonight,&quot;  and I usually insert, &quot;if you&#39;re not busy or you don&#39;t<br/>
mind.&quot;  Sometimes I take the trash out, just &#39;cause I think of it or I<br/>
know he is busy.  DS also voluntarily does loads of laundry, loads and<br/>
unloads the dishwasher, cleans his room and mows the lawn when it needs<br/>
to be mowed (we pay him to do this but rarely need to ask him to do it.)<br/>
<br/>
My 9yo daughter likes best to help out by surprising me with cleaning<br/>
her bedroom or the living room.  These surprises usually entail<br/>
instructions to me like, &quot;DON&#39;T come in here until I say it&#39;s okay!&quot; She<br/>
really loves the feeling of a surprise gift of cleaning.  I often pick<br/>
up her room while I&#39;m hanging out with her, listening to her read to me<br/>
or just chatting. She doesn&#39;t even  notice I&#39;m doing it at the time but<br/>
afterwards she notices how clean her room is and she thanks me!<br/>
<br/>
When we&#39;re cleaning for guests my kids happily work off of my own list<br/>
and will even continued to cross off tasks while I&#39;m out running<br/>
errands.  There are times when they happily vaccuum, dust, mop etc. too<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion and experience, the attitude one takes towards<br/>
housecleaning and their children&#39;s participation in housecleaning (or<br/>
lack thereof) can make all the difference in the world as to how things<br/>
work out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1956327863">This is a HUGE issue for me.<br/>
<br/>
I want to come back and read all these responses, but I just have a<br/>
minute--<br/>
<br/>
My husband has actually said to me that because he pays the bills, he<br/>
doesn&#39;t have to do HIS OWN LAUNDRY, dishes EVER, I pick up all his<br/>
soda cans and plates that he leaves laying around even in the<br/>
bathroom.  The worst part?  He&#39;s unemployed.  He does eBay stuff, and<br/>
the occassional computer repair, but he has more time than I do.  It&#39;s<br/>
completely crazy.  I think, Am I the only sane person alive?<br/>
<br/>
My 4-year-old has just started helping me out with cleaning, she<br/>
cleans her room and picks up all the toys in the living room.  I am so<br/>
proud of her and tell her all the time.  I swear, if it weren&#39;t for my<br/>
tiny little girl helping me I&#39;d go crazy.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what made her start doing this in the first place, I wish<br/>
I had some advice for you, but I thought you should know that you<br/>
aren&#39;t the only one!</div>

 </span></blockquote>This has proven true in our house. We have been de-schooling for 10<br/>
months and I am still learning to really fully totally let go of my<br/>
expectations of others to help out. It&#39;s a real shift in perspective<br/>
from &quot;can&#39;t you see what I do for you and don&#39;t you feel guilty and<br/>
want to help&quot; to me just doing because I chose to do things that help<br/>
everyone in the house feel comfortable and loved. Until this list I<br/>
didn&#39;t know that it was possible to chose to do things out of love.<br/>
<br/>
I did make a chore chart but it works totally different than any chore<br/>
chart I am aware of. It has pictures of the things to be done on index<br/>
cards with a happy face on one side and a sad face on the other, like<br/>
the dogs food and water bowl empty with a sad face and on the other<br/>
side is the bowls full and a smiley face, same with dishes and laundry<br/>
etc.. The concept is that the animals are happier and cared for when<br/>
these things are done, as are the people. I made it for myself because<br/>
I get so side tracked just walking to another room that I need lots of<br/>
visual reminders. If someone feels like doing something they just flip<br/>
over the card. No one *has* to do any of the chores (except me caring<br/>
for the animals).It also has eliminated the most asked question in the<br/>
house of &quot;did you feed the...fill in the blank?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My standards have also changed. Before unschooling I considered<br/>
cleaning the kitchen as all of the kitchen spic and span and wouldn&#39;t<br/>
do it till I could *do it right*. Now if there is enough room on the<br/>
counter to chop up stuff for dinner and the sink is empty enough to<br/>
wash the dirty pot to cook the chopped up stuff in I consider that a<br/>
successful kitchen day. What about the plates and forks you ask?? Well<br/>
those are washed while the chopped up stuff is cooking.<br/>
<br/>
My house is hardly clean and definatly not picked up but it does<br/>
function most of the time on the basic level of meeting the needs of<br/>
those who live in it and everyone is a lot happier.<br/>
<br/>
Peace and Joy,<br/>

cleaned all day and could do nothing fun until the house was <br/>
spotless-- I think it may be why I mostly avoid cleaning on the <br/>
weekends--<br/>
<br/>
Cleaning should be something you CHOOSE to do when you want to- or <br/>
whoever is bothered by the mess the most will usually clean it up<br/>
<br/>
my teenager (14) who was not raised unschoolish but had chores which <br/>
he hated- did clean the bathroom toilet and mirror because <br/>
he &quot;wanted&quot; to and admitted that he &quot;would&quot; clean stuff if he did <br/>
not have too. <br/>
<br/>
I just keep telling myself that it is all a choice and I choose it <br/>
and so does everyone eles. <br/>
<br/>
my girls 4.5 and 3 keep getting candy out of the halloween party <br/>
bucket and it was getting me irratated- so I got a big bowl for the <br/>
party candy and a slightly smaller bowl for the eating candy and we <br/>
split it up. Now they have been eating candy and candy and candy and <br/>
just when I wanted to scream &quot;eat some food&quot; the little one is <br/>
holding still with chocolate milk- I am left with an assortment of <br/>
tasted candy all over my keyboard because she did not like them.<br/>
<br/>
After they eat so much candy they open the fridge and say &quot;I need <br/>
some food&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I am thinking by the time halloween gets here they will be all <br/>
candied out from eating it all this week. Ahhhh we are going to have <br/>
candy forever</div>

Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: the feminist in me<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Delurking for this one,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Deb wrote pretty much what I was thinking.  When we transitioned to<br/>
&gt; RUing the chore issue took a little longer to settle in my mind than the<br/>
&gt; academics shift .<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What helped me was looking closely at and changing on my own attitude<br/>
&gt; towards housework.  I decided that I needed to own my own standards.<br/>
&gt; They were MY standards and I needed to take responsibility for them, not<br/>
&gt; hoist them onto my family.  I stopped expecting. I stopped expecting my<br/>
&gt; kids to have my same standards. I stopped expecting them to live up to<br/>
&gt; my standards.  Letting go of expectations was the key to my shift in<br/>
&gt; attitude.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Looking back on it I think that there had to be a period of absolutely<br/>
&gt; no expectations or even requests for help - a de-choring if you will -<br/>
&gt; before my kids believed that any housework they did would be of their<br/>
&gt; own free will.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m explaining this clearly. For me, I needed to release<br/>
&gt; all expectations and hopes that my kids would voluntarily pitch-in with<br/>
&gt; housework. I needed to do it cheerfully myself and let all resentment<br/>
&gt; evaporate.  During that time I routinely and intentionally swept through<br/>
&gt; the house, including their bedrooms, and picked-up dirty dishes, took<br/>
&gt; out their trash, hauled out their dirty laundry etc. with a spirit of<br/>
&gt; generosity and love for the awesome people I&#39;d chosen to bring into this<br/>
&gt; world.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It took some time but eventually my kids started to offer assistance or<br/>
&gt; do little things here and there without my asking. In the last year or<br/>
&gt; so I can now ask (always open-ended) for help and they usually oblige my<br/>
&gt; requests. I am careful not to abuse their generosity because I know that<br/>
&gt; my standards of clean are beyond theirs. Cleaning up can quickly go from<br/>
&gt; mutually satisfying to trying to satisfy mom if I&#39;m not careful.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I  try to always be respectful of their time and plans or activities and<br/>
&gt; let them know that if they are busy and don&#39;t want to break away, that<br/>
&gt; the task can either wait or I&#39;ll get to it soon enough.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My 16yo routinely takes the trash and recycling out each week. His<br/>
&gt; father will sometimes remind him, &quot;Remember, you HAVE to take the trash<br/>
&gt; out tonight,&quot;  and I usually insert, &quot;if you&#39;re not busy or you don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; mind.&quot;  Sometimes I take the trash out, just &#39;cause I think of it or I<br/>
&gt; know he is busy.  DS also voluntarily does loads of laundry, loads and<br/>
&gt; unloads the dishwasher, cleans his room and mows the lawn when it needs<br/>
&gt; to be mowed (we pay him to do this but rarely need to ask him to do it.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My 9yo daughter likes best to help out by surprising me with cleaning<br/>
&gt; her bedroom or the living room.  These surprises usually entail<br/>
&gt; instructions to me like, &quot;DON&#39;T come in here until I say it&#39;s okay!&quot; She<br/>
&gt; really loves the feeling of a surprise gift of cleaning.  I often pick<br/>
&gt; up her room while I&#39;m hanging out with her, listening to her read to me<br/>
&gt; or just chatting. She doesn&#39;t even  notice I&#39;m doing it at the time but<br/>
&gt; afterwards she notices how clean her room is and she thanks me!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When we&#39;re cleaning for guests my kids happily work off of my own list<br/>
&gt; and will even continued to cross off tasks while I&#39;m out running<br/>
&gt; errands.  There are times when they happily vaccuum, dust, mop etc. too<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In my opinion and experience, the attitude one takes towards<br/>
&gt; housecleaning and their children&#39;s participation in housecleaning (or<br/>
&gt; lack thereof) can make all the difference in the world as to how things<br/>
&gt; work out.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Sounds more like you resent their freedom because you feel burdened by<br/>
&gt;&gt; the housework. Maybe don&#39;t &quot;let it go&quot; so long - it sounds as if<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re<br/>
&gt;&gt; waiting and waiting (picture folded arms and tapping foot) until they<br/>
&gt;&gt; &quot;realize&quot; they &quot;should&quot; do something and it gets more and more out of<br/>
&gt;&gt; hand until finally you go ahead and &quot;give in&quot; and take care of it. How<br/>
&gt;&gt; about just doing what you see when you see it - a little here and<br/>
&gt; there,<br/>
&gt;&gt; 15 minutes in the kitchen then go do something else - watch TV, read,<br/>
&gt;&gt; knit, whatever - then 15 minutes in the living room and so on - rather<br/>
&gt;&gt; than waiting to see IF they are going to &quot;finally take responsibility<br/>
&gt;&gt; for their own messes&quot;. As others said, maybe it&#39;s a change of those<br/>
&gt; old<br/>
&gt;&gt; tapes in your head that are still playing and seeing everything you do<br/>
&gt;&gt; (or don&#39;t do) as YOUR choice. You can choose when and how and all to<br/>
&gt; do<br/>
&gt;&gt; something. You can choose to resent them not helping or choose to ask<br/>
&gt;&gt; for assistance. The key to asking for assistance is making it a bit<br/>
&gt; open<br/>
&gt;&gt; ended - that is, if you ask for the socks to be picked up off the<br/>
&gt; living<br/>
&gt;&gt; room floor, do it with the expectation that it will get done<br/>
&gt; *sometime*,<br/>
&gt;&gt; but not *necessarily* the very minute you ask. I&#39;ve found it comes out<br/>
&gt;&gt; way better if I ask DS (9 yrs) &quot;Hey, can you get the shoes rounded up<br/>
&gt; at<br/>
&gt;&gt; the next commercial break?&quot; (or when you finish this level or when<br/>
&gt;&gt; you&#39;ve finished assembling that k&#39;nex invention...) rather than<br/>
&gt; stating<br/>
&gt;&gt; and/or expecting him to stop what he&#39;s doing *immediately* to do what<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-15278434">A couple of days ago my 8 yr old daughter came to me and said she wanted to<br/>
do a project. We were digging through our craft dresser and I kept offering<br/>
up ideas like painting or playing with the new moon sand. She didn&#39;t want to<br/>
do anything I suggested and had been picking out dust balls from the corners<br/>
of the drawers while we talked. I asked if she wanted to dust and her face<br/>
lit up as she ran out of the room to get an apron she likes to wear.<br/>
<br/>
So her project was dusting. I gave her the Swiffer dusters and let her have<br/>
at it. I didn&#39;t tell her where to dust or how to dust and she did an awesome<br/>
job. She dusted the craft dresser, she dusted the TV and fan and then<br/>
started in on a bookcase and that turned into rearranging all the shelves.<br/>
Right now there are stacks of books on the floor waiting to be organized and<br/>
put away. I will probably do that part but she&#39;ll be right there doing it<br/>
too, if she wants. I&#39;m not going to tell her that she started it so she<br/>
needs to finish it or any other dumb thing kids get told. That would suck<br/>
away her joy.<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;d been stomping around like a martyr about the housework and if I had<br/>
decided having a dusty house was not acceptable she wouldn&#39;t have had the<br/>
opportunity to pick the project of dusting. She got a lot of joy and<br/>
satisfaction out of her project, which in turn gave me a lot of joy and<br/>
satisfaction.<br/>
<br/>
I think my point is .. when people are not being yelled at or shamed into<br/>
helping with housework it turns into just another thing to do that is a<br/>
pleasant way to pass the time. My daughters dusting looked a lot like her<br/>
painting; joyfull. I hope it always stays that way. When my mother sees dust<br/>
her reaction is &quot;Oh shit, I have to dust.&quot; When I see dust my reaction is<br/>
&quot;Ok it&#39;s dusty. It can be dusty. It&#39;s fine.&quot; My daughter&#39;s reaction is &quot;Woo<br/>
Hoo!! Let&#39;s dust!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This unschooling stuff really does work and even if you don&#39;t &quot;get it&quot; (for<br/>
a very long time I didn&#39;t) you can fake it and even that works.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-352105699">Yes, Chris here. What Heather wrote is exactly what I meant.  I ask<br/>
without any expectation that they&#39;ll say yes and if they say no, it&#39;s no<br/>
skin off my back.  I give them unconditional love all the time. They do<br/>
not need to worry that if they opt to not help me that it&#39;ll affect my<br/>
mood or attitude toward them.  Once they realized that requests for help<br/>
were just that, requests and not manipulations, they helped more often<br/>
and with positive attitudes.<br/>

  A couple of days ago my 8 yr old daughter came to me and said she wanted to<br/>
  do a project. We were digging through our craft dresser and I kept offering<br/>
  up ideas like painting or playing with the new moon sand. She didn&#39;t want to<br/>
  do anything I suggested and had been picking out dust balls from the corners<br/>
  of the drawers while we talked. I asked if she wanted to dust and her face<br/>
  lit up as she ran out of the room to get an apron she likes to wear.<br/>
<br/>
  So her project was dusting. I gave her the Swiffer dusters and let her have<br/>
  at it. I didn&#39;t tell her where to dust or how to dust and she did an awesome<br/>
  job. She dusted the craft dresser, she dusted the TV and fan and then<br/>
  started in on a bookcase and that turned into rearranging all the shelves.<br/>
  Right now there are stacks of books on the floor waiting to be organized and<br/>
  put away. I will probably do that part but she&#39;ll be right there doing it<br/>
  too, if she wants. I&#39;m not going to tell her that she started it so she<br/>
  needs to finish it or any other dumb thing kids get told. That would suck<br/>
  away her joy.<br/>
<br/>
  If I&#39;d been stomping around like a martyr about the housework and if I had<br/>
  decided having a dusty house was not acceptable she wouldn&#39;t have had the<br/>
  opportunity to pick the project of dusting. She got a lot of joy and<br/>
  satisfaction out of her project, which in turn gave me a lot of joy and<br/>
  satisfaction.<br/>
<br/>
  I think my point is .. when people are not being yelled at or shamed into<br/>
  helping with housework it turns into just another thing to do that is a<br/>
  pleasant way to pass the time. My daughters dusting looked a lot like her<br/>
  painting; joyfull. I hope it always stays that way. When my mother sees dust<br/>
  her reaction is &quot;Oh shit, I have to dust.&quot; When I see dust my reaction is<br/>
  &quot;Ok it&#39;s dusty. It can be dusty. It&#39;s fine.&quot; My daughter&#39;s reaction is &quot;Woo<br/>

point out that there was a room full of toys (we had them in the<br/>

&quot;But what can I dooooo?&quot;  (Her mom thought it was a &quot;cute&quot; little<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1256211540">I&#39;ve been following this thread, and I think a lot of excellent <br/>
points have been made.  I experiences this kind of resentment towards <br/>
my husband early in our marriage, but have since gotten over it.  <br/>
We&#39;ve evolved into a system of whoever it bothers the most takes care <br/>
of it (thereby making it a choice), and we&#39;ve carried that over to <br/>
the kids (who of course don&#39;t even see the mess).  I once read a <br/>
quote: &quot;We&#39;re raising boys now.  We can raise grass later&quot;.  This <br/>
kind of sums up my cleaning philosophy.  My house is sanitary, and <br/>
you won&#39;t break anything unless you walk into one of the kids&#39; rooms, <br/>
but cleaning is not a top priority.<br/>
<br/>
With that said, I want to reitterate how important it is to model for <br/>
your children.  If cleaning looks important and fun, younger children <br/>
will get upset if you tell them they can&#39;t do it (One of my boys once <br/>
had a tantrum because I wouldn&#39;t let him help with the laundry - <br/>
lesson learned). You also need to model helping.  This starts with <br/>
the adults in the house making a concious effort to be helpful <br/>
towards each other and towards the children.  As with any learning, <br/>
it takes time to learn to be helpful, so don&#39;t expect instant <br/>
helpfulness.<br/>
<br/>
My husband once provided an anology that helps clearify another <br/>
related point.  He works, and I shop.  Thus, he expects me to keep <br/>
milk in the fridge.  If he looked in the fridge everyday and there <br/>
was no milk for a week, he could choose to get angry and resentful <br/>
about the lack of milk (and I would be clueless about this), or he <br/>
could choose to let me know that he would like me to get milk.  <br/>
Obviously, asking me to buy milk would be more productive.  Likewise, <br/>
asking the kids to help is much more productive than getting mad when <br/>
they don&#39;t do something they don&#39;t even know you want them to do.<br/>
<br/>
Which brings me to my next point -- When you ask a yes or no <br/>
question, expect a yes or no answer (and accept it).  Once you learn <br/>
how to do this, kids do what you ask out of love rather than out of <br/>
fear, and if they don&#39;t do it, they have a logical reason.<br/>
<br/>
Also, when thinking about kids and cleaning, keep in mind that they <br/>
don&#39;t have the same planning skills as an adult.  They look at a <br/>
messy room and have no idea how to accomplish the task of cleaning <br/>
the room.  It is an overwhelming task, and they don&#39;t even know where <br/>
to begin, so they don&#39;t start.  Rather than having children clean a <br/>
room, it is much more developmentally appropriate to start the job <br/>
and ask them to help you, and if you&#39;ve done the work of positive <br/>
modeling and they know they really do have a choice, then most of the <br/>
time they will help.  If they don&#39;t, they don&#39;t -- Keep in mind who <br/>
owns the problem (whoever is bothered by it).<br/>

How could they get you to do it repeatedly?<br/>
<br/>
Really. Truly. Honestly. If there were a way to make children into  <br/>
obedient convenience parents would have figured it out long ago and  <br/>
there would be a single book out there that gave you the steps.<br/>
<br/>
Unless you wish to sacrifice your relationship with him, there isn&#39;t  <br/>
a way to make him.<br/>
<br/>
If you become a person he&#39;d love to help, when he&#39;s developmentally  <br/>
able he will help you.<br/>
<br/>
Treat clean up as something that you own, that&#39;s important to you and  <br/>
invite him along to help. As long as you don&#39;t expect his help --  <br/>
don&#39;t turn him into conscripted labor -- he&#39;s way more likely to help.<br/>
<br/>
I think what would probably help most in your situation is to keep on  <br/>
top of it. Treat it as something that *is* important to you, rather   <br/>
than waiting until you can&#39;t stand it any longer and turning into an  <br/>
emotional beast about it. (Not saying that you do, only projecting  <br/>
that most of us have been there and done that!)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How about asking your sister (and your son) for help in rethinking  <br/>
the problem? How about ways to prevent him from getting into your  <br/>
stuff? Cabinets that lock, for instance. If he&#39;s very young, just the  <br/>
simple childproof locks might be enough.<br/>
<br/>
If he plays with toys on the floor, if you can help him play on a big  <br/>
plastic sheet, then it can be folded up and all the toys dumped into  <br/>
a bin when he&#39;s done.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How do other disabled people who have difficulties reaching things on  <br/>
the floor handle it? There&#39;s a huge amount of brain power out there  <br/>
working on these problems! Tap into it :-) It&#39;s so much easier for  <br/>
people now that the internet reaches everywhere. Imagine what it was  <br/>
like for people trying to get information when their only resource  <br/>
was local people and local books.<br/>
<br/>
I know I&#39;ve seen those long grabber things for reaching things on  <br/>
high shelves.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m 100% unschooling when it comes to learning &quot;academics&quot; in its <br/>
variety of<br/>
forms in everyday life.   The feminist in me struggles with aspects of<br/>
unschooling like chores.  My mom was the type who did everything for my <br/>
dad<br/>
and my brother and I.  As I got older I hated seeing her being treated <br/>
as a<br/>
traditional housewife, who kept the house and catered to everyone in <br/>
it,<br/>
simply bc she was a woman.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Feminism isn&#39;t about NOT cleaning the house because you&#39;re a woman. <br/>
It&#39;s about CHOICE. You can still be a feminist and care for your <br/>
family. The deal is that you&#39;re free to CHOOSE to make other choices.<br/>
<br/>
Your mother may have *wanted* to be a mom! Her choice wasn&#39;t about <br/>
*you* or what you hated. It was about what *she* wanted for *herself*.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
 I don&#39;t want my girls to think they will be<br/>
expected to clean and cook and do all the chores for their household <br/>
and I<br/>
don&#39;t want my son to expect that role from his wife should he decide to<br/>
marry.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And what if the girls decided that that was the role they wanted? To <br/>
have a family and care for it? What if your son married a woman who <br/>
*wanted* to stay home and cater to her family?<br/>
<br/>
I would rather my sons marry women who would want to be with their <br/>
children. I would certainly hope my boys would choose women who would <br/>
rather be home with their kids than out making million dollar deals <br/>
while the kids were in school all day. (Unless the boys were the ones <br/>
at home with the children! &lt;G&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
As an unschooling mom, I *do* need to be with my children. That&#39;s how <br/>
it works. I can certainly do other things (and I do a LOT of other <br/>
things) while I&#39;m home caring for them and cleaning and such. But it&#39;s <br/>
what I *do*---care for them and clean the house.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For me personally, I don&#39;t have the energy, desire or time to clean up <br/>
after<br/>
everyone (I have 4 kids btw ages 8, 6, 4 and 17 months, so I am wiped <br/>
out<br/>
anyway!).  I get resentful when I clean a room only to have it get <br/>
messed up<br/>
and left that way.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Then change your attitude. You have four under eight. You really <br/>
shouldn&#39;t *expect* it to be clean. You *should* expect it to be messed <br/>
up. That&#39;s the way it is with children. Children are messy. Understand <br/>
that. And lose the resentfulness. You&#39;re choosing to be resentful. <br/>
CHOOSE to be appreciative of what you have: four beautiful children who <br/>
are healthy and happy enough to be messy.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I&#39;m fine with the mess, but not with cleaning it up if I<br/>
didn&#39;t make it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And small children should *care*?<br/>
<br/>
You have four small children. Who else is going to clean their messes?<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re saying that a femininst shouldn&#39;t have to, but that small <br/>
children *should*???<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I don&#39;t expect anyone to pick up my dirty clothes, or my<br/>
mess in the kitchen after cooking, why should I be expected to do all <br/>
the<br/>
chores, especially their messes?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=--=<br/>
<br/>
Because you&#39;re the mom. You took on that role when you decided to have <br/>
children. It comes with the package---unless you can afford a maid <br/>
(might want to look for a feminist maid though---one that will work <br/>
outside the home &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Shouldn&#39;t everyone chip in while in a<br/>
communal environment (as all houses are)?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
May the children leave if the communal laws don&#39;t suit them?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I&#39;m not a neat freak, I don&#39;t<br/>
mind clutter or dirty bathrooms - I just resent it when I am expected <br/>
to do<br/>
all the chores over and over.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=--<br/>
<br/>
I still feel that way sometimes. It&#39;s as if there are always dishes to <br/>
be washed and clothes to be folded. It&#39;s a never-ending job.<br/>
<br/>
Then I quickly kick myself in the butt and remember that I&#39;m so happy <br/>
to have dishes to wash and a beautiful house to care for and wonderful <br/>
children that I can still hug.<br/>
<br/>
I accept the responsibility of having a nice house (I could be living <br/>
in a car) and having dishes to wash (I could be eating at a homeless <br/>
shelter) and having fresh, clean clothes to fold (I could be down to my <br/>
last set of clothes and can&#39;t wash them because I&#39;d be standing naked <br/>
at the laundromat---ugh!). I still have my children to pick up after <br/>
(They are healthy and happy. But I still think of Jacob and Sam and <br/>
Hannah (all dead) every day when I need to remember to appreciatae what <br/>
I have right NOW, right HERE!), so I&#39;m happy to pick up after them.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ll be gone soon anyway---they grow up so fast. My older son is 19 <br/>
and in Charleston this week, visiting the girlfriend. I miss him. I <br/>
HATE when he&#39;s gone. Now that he&#39;s gone so much, I treasure the moments <br/>
we DO have together.<br/>
<br/>
You can choose to be resentful or appreciative. I promise you that you <br/>
will be happier if you choose appreciation over resentfulness.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-===-<br/>
<br/>
 I once threw away 4 or 5 board games bc they<br/>
were left out for days, pieces all over the place - I didn&#39;t want to <br/>
burden<br/>
the kids with cleaning . . . but got pissed and threw them out bc (as I <br/>
told<br/>
them) I am not their servant.<br/>
<br/>
Your thought or opinions?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-====<br/>
<br/>
I hope your children don&#39;t treat you as thoughlessly and with such <br/>
disrepect if/when you are ever under their care.<br/>
<br/>
And hey---big news! You ARE their servant! They are incapable of caring <br/>
for themselves, so it falls upon YOU, their mother. The twist is that <br/>
you are the servant with the POWER. Scary scenario, huh? Someone who <br/>
cares for their every need, but who can cut OFF all service and <br/>
happiness?<br/>
<br/>
It really will pay off if you show how *important* and *fulfilling* and <br/>
*joyful* all that cleaning and caring for others can be. Show them what <br/>
an HONOR it is to serve. That&#39;s a &quot;lesson&quot; they will keep for always. <br/>
Model it. BE the example you want to see.<br/>
