<div id="ygrps-yiv-84044893">I also love Harry Potter.  It is the first book I have read for pure <br/>
enjoyment since I graduated from college 15 years ago!  I have, of <br/>
course, read way too many books on parenting, special needs books, <br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I see Harry Potter as my reward that I get to read right <br/>
before I go to sleep.  I look forward to it all day and enjoy my <br/>
habit of nightly reading.  I keep reading the books over and over, <br/>
and eventually I will have to find something else.<br/>
<br/>
It is strange to me, though, that so many unschooling moms enjoy this <br/>
series when the setting is kids at a boarding school.  Sometimes when <br/>
I read it, I actually have the thought enter my mind that I wish my <br/>
boys could go to a boarding school where they could have these <br/>
adventures and I could live out my fantasy of being Mrs. Weasley and <br/>
spend my days knitting sweaters.  But then I realize that if Hogwarts <br/>
were indeed real, there would be drugs along with all the bullying, <br/>
etc., and I would miss my boys.  However, when my husband has taken <br/>
my boys for several days to his brother&#39;s and recently they left for <br/>
a weekend together to see an away football game, I reveled in being <br/>
alone.  I didn&#39;t even turn on the TV because I was enjoying the quiet.<br/>

different from traditional schools.  Aside from History of Magic<br/>
(snore) everything that they learn is stuff that they are going to use<br/>
when they get into their adult lives.  As witches and wizards they<br/>
need to know how to use potions, how to charm a teapot into pouring<br/>
itself (heck, I would if I could LOL!), and how to defend oneself<br/>
against the evils of dark arts.  The first few years is a general over<br/>
view of the magical world, but, as we have seen, one can choose not to<br/>
take some courses or to take alternative courses to the norm (Hermione<br/>
taking arithmancy and not taking divination.)  And after the OWL&#39;s one<br/>
really starts honing in on the subjects that they want to do.<br/>

The magical community is much different from the Muggle.  Jo Rowling<br/>
was asked once where the kids learned to read and do math because they<br/>
never seemed to be in math or grammar classes and her reply was that<br/>
most young witches and wizards are homeschooled.  Can&#39;t you just see<br/>
Molly Weasley unschooling her crew?  :-D  Another thought (as if the<br/>
HP world was real LOL!) is that Hogwarts truly is the safest place for<br/>
children to learn magic and be protected until they can protect<br/>
themselves.  With characters like Voldemort (oh get over it, Ron)<br/>
hanging about and knowing that he has powers that even the most<br/>
talented of magical folks can&#39;t compete against, I think that I would<br/>
prefer my child to be as safe as possible under the care of Dumbledore<br/>

We are HUGE HP fans here.  We have a party every year when the newest<br/>
movie comes out.  We dress in costumes, eat wizarding food (Bertie<br/>
Botts, skiving snack boxes, pumpkin pasties, butterbeer, chocolate<br/>
frogs (we make them ourselves), and lemondrops), watch all the movies<br/>
that have already been released, have trivia competitions (is there an<br/>
HP Trivial Pursuit?), and then go to the midnight showing of the<br/>
newest movie.  We go to book release parties (in costume) and win<br/>
prizes (I have a Hogwart&#39;s t-shirt that says Professor on the back)<br/>
and quote from the books all the time. We are constantly arguing over<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1738343697">--Michelle, you should be one of the posters on the Harry Potter for <br/>
Grown-ups chatlist.  I check in there at times to see people&#39;s takes <br/>
and predictions.  I&#39;ve never posted though.  These people have good <br/>
insight to the series, as do you.  I never thought about how the <br/>
students are basically learning life skills they need.  I do love <br/>
Harry Potter and have thrown parties for when the new movies come out <br/>
as well.  I made a treacle tart and it was just as good as I thought <br/>
it would be!  I wore a Mrs. Weasley costume to one of the showings, <br/>
but my boys were embarrassed (party-poopers...)  She said in an <br/>
interview recently that she told J.K. she hopes her character will <br/>
take care of Voldemort and be the hero at the end.  I would love <br/>
that!  I wish those of us who are fans could get together for a big <br/>
Harry Potter party.  When I was a kid, I used to pretend I was living <br/>
in the olden days like Laura Ingalls.  I wonder what my next fantasy <br/>
will be (I really like Pirates of the Caribbean as well)~<br/>

problem solving. The stuff they do and figure out outside the  <br/>
classrooms is the essence of how unschooling works. And it proves to  <br/>
be the most important stuff they learn.<br/>
<br/>
That they don&#39;t have parents with them supporting them just makes for  <br/>
a better story ;-) The freedom to make decisions on their own and do  <br/>
as they feel best is seen as good (even if it doesn&#39;t come out right)  <br/>
and control (teachers enforcing rules, parents saying no) is seen as  <br/>
bad.<br/>

<br/>
********<br/>
I think the whole boarding school thing is important because Harry HAD to  <br/>
have a life completely separate from the Dursleys.  There HAD to be  positive <br/>
parental figures in his life that looked after him day and night.   He HAD to be <br/>
a wizard full-time, except the summer.  And since wizard  children are few <br/>
and far between, it just makes sense to have one school.   I did always wonder <br/>
if any children were from Hogsmeade and got to go home  more.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t remember any mention of any of the children missing home or having  a <br/>
tough time adjusting (except Neville, but I think he is happier at Hogwarts  <br/>
than with his Gran), so maybe JKR has just made it a  non-issue.   Perhaps all <br/>
that homeschooling gave them a good  base.  :)<br/>
 <br/>
Another thought,  the story often has an nineteenth century feel to it  and <br/>
boarding school fits into that.  Look at Dickens or other writing  at the time, <br/>
(male) children of a certain age went off to school.  There  just weren&#39;t <br/>
public schools on every corner!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-242811917">Wow Michelle,  sounds like you guys have a blast.  We<br/>
have a couple of Harry Potter games,  the Harry Potter<br/>
Scene it game, is alot of fun, and Harry Potter Trivia<br/>
game.  The Scene it game we got at Target, and the<br/>
trivia game I got at a garage sale for I think it was<br/>
$2.00.  I&#39;m not sure where you can find the games, but<br/>
they are the ones that I am best at, because I&#39;ve read<br/>
all of the books at least 2 or three times.  Glad to<br/>
see someone else enjoys the Harry Potter series too.<br/>

&gt; &gt; It is strange to me, though, that so many<br/>
&gt; unschooling moms enjoy this<br/>
&gt; &gt; series when the setting is kids at a boarding<br/>
&gt; school. Sometimes when<br/>
&gt; &gt; I read it, I actually have the thought enter my<br/>
&gt; mind that I wish my<br/>
&gt; &gt; boys could go to a boarding school where they<br/>
&gt; could have these<br/>
&gt; &gt; adventures and I could live out my fantasy of<br/>
&gt; being Mrs. Weasley and<br/>
&gt; &gt; spend my days knitting sweaters. But then I<br/>
&gt; realize that if Hogwarts<br/>
&gt; &gt; were indeed real, there would be drugs along with<br/>
&gt; all the bullying,<br/>
&gt; &gt; etc., and I would miss my boys.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think that bullying can happen in any setting and<br/>
&gt; have seen it<br/>
&gt; happen even in an unschooling setting :( yet, I see<br/>
&gt; Hogwarts as being<br/>
&gt; different from traditional schools. Aside from<br/>
&gt; History of Magic<br/>
&gt; (snore) everything that they learn is stuff that<br/>
&gt; they are going to use<br/>
&gt; when they get into their adult lives. As witches and<br/>
&gt; wizards they<br/>
&gt; need to know how to use potions, how to charm a<br/>
&gt; teapot into pouring<br/>
&gt; itself (heck, I would if I could LOL!), and how to<br/>
&gt; defend oneself<br/>
&gt; against the evils of dark arts. The first few years<br/>
&gt; is a general over<br/>
&gt; view of the magical world, but, as we have seen, one<br/>
&gt; can choose not to<br/>
&gt; take some courses or to take alternative courses to<br/>
&gt; the norm (Hermione<br/>
&gt; taking arithmancy and not taking divination.) And<br/>
&gt; after the OWL&#39;s one<br/>
&gt; really starts honing in on the subjects that they<br/>
&gt; want to do.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The magical community is much different from the<br/>
&gt; Muggle. Jo Rowling<br/>
&gt; was asked once where the kids learned to read and do<br/>
&gt; math because they<br/>
&gt; never seemed to be in math or grammar classes and<br/>
&gt; her reply was that<br/>
&gt; most young witches and wizards are homeschooled.<br/>
&gt; Can&#39;t you just see<br/>
&gt; Molly Weasley unschooling her crew? :-D Another<br/>
&gt; thought (as if the<br/>
&gt; HP world was real LOL!) is that Hogwarts truly is<br/>
&gt; the safest place for<br/>
&gt; children to learn magic and be protected until they<br/>
&gt; can protect<br/>
&gt; themselves. With characters like Voldemort (oh get<br/>
&gt; over it, Ron)<br/>
&gt; hanging about and knowing that he has powers that<br/>
&gt; even the most<br/>
&gt; talented of magical folks can&#39;t compete against, I<br/>
&gt; think that I would<br/>
&gt; prefer my child to be as safe as possible under the<br/>
&gt; care of Dumbledore<br/>
&gt; (et al) and all its magical protections.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We are HUGE HP fans here. We have a party every year<br/>
&gt; when the newest<br/>
&gt; movie comes out. We dress in costumes, eat wizarding<br/>
&gt; food (Bertie<br/>
&gt; Botts, skiving snack boxes, pumpkin pasties,<br/>
&gt; butterbeer, chocolate<br/>
&gt; frogs (we make them ourselves), and lemondrops),<br/>
&gt; watch all the movies<br/>
&gt; that have already been released, have trivia<br/>
&gt; competitions (is there an<br/>
&gt; HP Trivial Pursuit?), and then go to the midnight<br/>
&gt; showing of the<br/>
&gt; newest movie. We go to book release parties (in<br/>
&gt; costume) and win<br/>
&gt; prizes (I have a Hogwart&#39;s t-shirt that says<br/>
&gt; Professor on the back)<br/>
&gt; and quote from the books all the time. We are<br/>
&gt; constantly arguing over<br/>
&gt; what is going to happen and challenging our memories<br/>
&gt; to defend<br/>
&gt; different points of view.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1535583988">I went to boarding school in Oklahoma for my last two years of high  <br/>
school, one that was about half an hour from my house. I loved it!  <br/>
There was a lot of work involved, but it was all stuff I got to  <br/>
choose. It was very intense living with 100 other kids in a dorm  <br/>
setting, but I made some of the best friends of my life. I missed  <br/>
being away from my family, but I realized how very toxic my family  <br/>
was . I learned how to be in charge of myself for the first time  <br/>
ever, and it also changed my viewpoint of the school system. And we  <br/>
did have a lot of adventures after dark ;-) It&#39;s like an immersion,  <br/>
it&#39;s much more intense, and things are learned deeper.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1380955813">I know several people that went to boarding schools.  Chicago and the  <br/>

not.<br/>
 <br/>
My husband went to American Collegiate Schools in Athens, Greece.   They (and <br/>
I believe the other ACS in London, Paris, etc.) was  a partial boarding <br/>
school.  Most of the boarding kids at his school  were from the Mid-East and had <br/>
mucho oil money.<br/>
 <br/>
I used to work for a woman that went to boarding school someplace like  <br/>
Colorado in the sixties.  Her roommate was kind of &quot;nouveau riche&quot; but  nothing too <br/>
odd.  The roommates dad came to town and took a bunch of the  girls out on <br/>
the town....limo, fancy dinner, the whole nine yards.  She  found out much later <br/>

   I have never even heard of a boarding school here in the U.S.,except<br/>
for several schools for autistic spectrum kids or kids who are having<br/>
behavioral issues, etc.  Is there a regular educational boarding school<br/>
here?  My kids have asked me this and I don&#39;t know.<br/>
