&quot;  Work like you don&#39;t need the money, love like you&#39;ve never been hurt, and <br/>
dance  like you do when nobody&#39;s watching.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;All that is necessary for the  triumph of evil is that good people do<br/>
nothing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot; Knowledge is power  but how you use that power defines wether you are good <br/>
or evil.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-14398756">wanted to support kelly&#39;s plug for Rue&#39;s book. I just wrote a review  <br/>
of the book for the main Australian homeschool mag which you can read  <br/>
at:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://theparentingpit.com/reviews/rue-kream">http://theparentingpit.com/reviews/rue-kream</a> ï¿½-parenting-a-free-child/<br/>
<br/>
the review is pitched at homeschoolers who are &quot;natural learners&quot; but  <br/>
still implement regulated/ control parenting, which is the main  <br/>
tendency here in Australia (RU is still relatively small but growing).<br/>
<br/>
Rue&#39;s book along with Joyce Fetteroll&#39;s web site at http:// <br/>
www.joyfullyrejoycing.com/ are the two main resources (besides these  <br/>
elists) that got us through our common freak outs particularly as we  <br/>
unregulated food & tv.<br/>
<br/>
  Rue&#39;s book is slightly harder to get here so we ended up ordering  <br/>
over a dozen copies for interested friends, homeschoolers and family.  <br/>
I think people suspect that we get a commission on her book sales  <br/>
because we have been plugging it so much  ;)<br/>
<br/>
cheers<br/>
