<div id="ygrps-yiv-1694952573">My husband is up for a promotion in Louisville, Colorado and I am<br/>
wondering if anyone is from that area.  We would be moving from<br/>
Florida and I might not have a chance to visit before he accepts or<br/>
declines the job (I am 30 weeks pregnant).  My husband LOVES it there<br/>
and has been there many times, but I have never been out west- only<br/>
traveled north and south.<br/>
<br/>
Is there an unschooling community in that area? What else can anyone<br/>
tell me about the area-positive and negative?<br/>
<br/>
Please feel free to e-mail me off list.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!  Jeanette</div>
