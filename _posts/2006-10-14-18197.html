<div id="ygrps-yiv-570762365">I&#39;m trying to figure out how to best fascilitate my five year old <br/>
son&#39;s love of fishing.  This is his passion at the moment and has led <br/>
to millions of projects and many fishing trips.  He is learning <br/>
fishing knots, he is making flies, wooden bobbers, sinkers from <br/>
bolts, he has numerous fishing poles, some bought and some he made.  <br/>
we learned how to make a reel fro a spool. However, he wants to go <br/>
fishing all the time.  We go fishing in the evening after papa gets <br/>
home from work, we fish on weekends, we go to the fish hatcheries, we <br/>
go to the nearby river midweek.  We go fishing about 3 times a week <br/>
right now, earlier it was every day.  My husband said, &quot;I always knew <br/>
our kids would make us do what we always wanted to do&quot;.  However,  I <br/>
feel that I am getting worn out doing more than I can handle.  I need <br/>
to stay at home often to care for our grandmother as well as work <br/>
when all he want to do is fishing.  I just want to say NO, but <br/>
somehow drum up the last ounce of energy and go fishing yet again.  I <br/>
am tired and his drive to go fishing is stronger than my energy level <br/>
at this point.  He doesn&#39;t seem to care if I am tired or have other <br/>
things to do.  I&#39;m getting pretty good at recognizing if something I <br/>
am doing is really all that important or not.  I guess this is his <br/>
first interest that requires parental involvement at such a level <br/>
(during his mailcarrier phase for instance, all I needed to do was <br/>
keep up the office supplies and gets one cent stamps periodically).  <br/>
How do parents encourage their child&#39;s interests while taking care of <br/>
their own commitments, time and energy needs?</div>
