<div id="ygrps-yiv-415335667">I hesitated to ask for advice but I don&#39;t know a way of thinking about this and decided to ask all of you wise unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Is it wrong to ask for help with housework and responsibilities around the house from my 16 year old.  I have not demanded this in the past, hoping that he would volunteer.  And he has, on a few occasions offered to help me.<br/>
I am working two jobs and am the only one in the household and do everything ( and do not have the time I had when I was married and not working to devote to him- but this is another issue).  And I am exhausted and stressed.  I would REALLY like him to help me, but understand that he has the right to say no, which he almost exclusively tells me.<br/>
<br/>
My question is how do I deal with the feelings I have about this, which is a combination of desperation, disappointment and resentment.  I keep these to myself, but I know he senses my frustration.  At times I can control these feelings with lots of meditation, talking to friends, etc.  I just don&#39;t know how to handle the stressful times and the practical matters like the fact that the pets still need to be fed and have water...<br/>
<br/>
Sorry about the negative tone....  I want to change this. Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think the question to ask isn&#39;t &quot;Is it wrong?&quot; but &quot;What are the  <br/>
effects?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In fact that will help anyone trying to grasp unschooling.  <br/>
Unschooling and mindful parenting shouldn&#39;t be a way of sorting  <br/>
behaviors into two sets &quot;Part of radical unschooling&quot; and &quot;Not part  <br/>
of radical unschooling&quot;. The goal is understanding the philosophy to  <br/>
see why something fits and something doesn&#39;t fit.<br/>
<br/>
Telling or expecting a 6yo to clean their room is bound to tear at  <br/>
the relationship. Their view of the world, their capabilities just  <br/>
aren&#39;t adult like enough for them to see and feel that as anything  <br/>
more than conscripted labor for something they doesn&#39;t care about yet.<br/>
<br/>
A 16 yo has a more adult outlook and can understand the time tasks  <br/>
take and that not doing laundry means not having clean clothes and so  <br/>
on.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than approach him with a list of to dos, involve him in the  <br/>
process. Let him know you&#39;re feeling overwhelmed with the change in  <br/>
lifestyle and keeping up with life maintenance tasks and you&#39;d like  <br/>
his help streamlining things. Throughout the week you could both come  <br/>
up with tasks that need done. Then take him to a coffee shop as a  <br/>
special treat and both of you hash them out, see if you can come up  <br/>
with new ways of doing things that don&#39;t take so much time. Be  <br/>
flexible and open to new ideas :-) See things in new ways. Don&#39;t say  <br/>
no or that won&#39;t work. Do say, &quot;Well, what about ...&quot; so you can work  <br/>
together with a full picture.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1134116424">Amy - <br/>
<br/>
Great question.  I can&#39;t wait to hear what the group says.  <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my take on it...<br/>
<br/>
The feelings you describe - &quot;desperation, disappointment and resentment&quot; - indicate that you have some un-met needs.  <br/>
<br/>
However, &quot;housecleaning&quot; is a strategy for meeting a need, not the need itself.  <br/>
<br/>
I suspect that the actual need you have is for &quot;support&quot; and perhaps &quot;empathy&quot; - both types of &quot;interdependence&quot;.  You say, &quot;I am working two jobs and am the only one in the household and do everything ( and do not have the time I had when I was married and not working to devote to him- but this is another issue)&quot; and in that phrase I can really hear a sense of isolation, loss, and frustration with having to be totally independent. <br/>
<br/>
So, perhaps you could simply share your feelings and needs with him.<br/>
<br/>
You could say, &quot;I am feeling resentful, desperate, and disappointed which tells me that I&#39;ve got some unmet needs.  I think those needs are for support and empathy.  Sometimes I come to you to meet those needs.  Although, you know, it may be up to me to find a way to get those needs meet somewhere else.  I&#39;d take any ideas or help you have to offer me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You might be surprised to find out that he shares these needs with you, or that he has other needs he&#39;s been keeping inside as well that he decides to share with you now that you&#39;ve opened up to him.  After all, he suffered a loss as well.<br/>
<br/>
Together the two of you may come up with a strategy to help meet your needs for support and empathy.  <br/>
<br/>
Or, you may have to come up with the strategy on your own.  After all, you are responsible for meeting your own needs.  <br/>
<br/>
Or, he may stew on what you&#39;ve said and come up with his own strategy to meet your needs, which can be such a delicious surprise as it will come straight from his heart to yours.<br/>
<br/>
So, let go of asking for help around the house, and instead, open up to him with your feelings and needs. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
<br/>

There have been some wonderful posts so far, but I wanted to comment on this, specifically. It may be that this isn&#39;t another issue, but part of the same issue. As Elli commented, talking with him about your feelings and asking about his could be really valuable. Is it possible he&#39;s feeling overwhelmed and helpless and that&#39;s coming out in him not wanting to give help as a result? In fact, it might be a good idea to Not start out with &quot;I&#39;m feeling so stressed out...&quot; when you try to open a conversation about all this. If he&#39;s feeling stressed, too, that could be the last thing he wants to hear (I don&#39;t know him, though, this is just me thinking back to My mother saying &quot;I want help&quot; to a dd who was feeling overwhelmed already!). <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1982370827">Have you discussed the changes in the situation? - really discussed<br/>
together because HIS situation has changed too, so you both need to<br/>
figure out a new dynamic to the household. At the same time, look<br/>
realistically at what can and can&#39;t happen - you may not be able to<br/>
handle vacuuming every other day like you used to or the dishes might<br/>
have to sit a day or the tub doesn&#39;t get cleaned but every other week<br/>
now. Things may not be &quot;kept up&quot; the way they were when you had more<br/>
available time to do them. Maybe cooking meals once a week and freezing<br/>
them so that you/he can heat&#39;n&#39;eat instead of home cooking daily. And so<br/>
on. A self-waterer for pets (and, if they won&#39;t eat themselves sick,<br/>
they have self-feeders for cats and dogs that work pretty much the same<br/>
way) so that the critters are somewhat independent of immediate daily<br/>
care - refilling the self-care facilities every few days or a week,<br/>
depending on number of critters is a lot less time involved than daily<br/>
caring (FWIW I put food down for dog(s) when I walk out the door to work<br/>
in the morning and when I walk in the door when I get home - food and<br/>
dish(es) are right there in the entry area - no cat, since a cat would<br/>
end up as dog food).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-295380410">Hi Amy,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been a single parent for 2 years now, my son is 20 and out of the<br/>
house, and my 2 girls are 15 and 11. After my ex moved out, I took a bit of<br/>
time to recover my equilibrium, then I got a part time job, I was only<br/>
working 15-20 hours a week and I hated it. I can understand why you are so<br/>
overwhelmed with you working 2 jobs! What Ren said about her friend getting<br/>
creative in ways to make income is a great idea. Are there things that you<br/>
like to do that could bring you a decent income, but allow you to be home<br/>
more, therefore having more time for yourself, your kids and your house? I<br/>
got my certification to be a Postpartum Doula and to teach infant soothing<br/>
classes. I can set my own schedule and not work more than 20 hours a week,<br/>
yet still bring in a good income. Definitely worth looking into. It&#39;s so<br/>
worth it to be able to find a way to enjoy the Now!<br/>
<br/>
Also, I think the advice that Deb gave was great also. Do you know how he is<br/>
feelingand have you talked to him about what you&#39;re feeling? I don&#39;t know<br/>
how long you&#39;ve been a single parent, but you might be suprised the affect<br/>
on him. Once I went to work part-time, my girls had a hard time. It wasn&#39;t<br/>
the divorce that was hard for them, but me being gone. I had been a stay at<br/>
home mom their whole lives, and my older daughter, Kianne, took on too much<br/>
responsibility while I was away, that was very hard on her. That was when I<br/>
decided to quit and focus on my own businesses. Now, I know when I do go to<br/>
work, (I keep putting it off, lol) we will handle it better this time<br/>
around!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just this year that my girls and I have settled into really living<br/>
unschooling and it is a huge relief to all of us. I found that after a bit<br/>
of time, I didn&#39;t mind that I was the one doing the majority of the work, it<br/>
was actually better. I wasn&#39;t nagging, creating an unhappy environment for<br/>
all of us. Now, when I am feeling overwhelmed and need some help, I just<br/>
ask, I usually get a more than willing yes from one or both of them. Now<br/>
that they aren&#39;t being made to do &quot;chores&quot;, and honestly there weren&#39;t that<br/>
many prior to our unschooling discovery, they do what they do much easier<br/>
and happier. And, now when I clean up, unless it&#39;s the kitchen, they hate<br/>
doing the kitchen, lol, they will often help pick up as I am doing, or start<br/>
a load of laundry when we are running out of clothes, things like that. Plus<br/>
the fact that we are all ok living in a fairly messy house, occasionally<br/>
doing a great clean, which is mostly done by me, but that&#39;s ok. It did take<br/>
time though, not only deschooling, but adjusting to this new life as a<br/>
different family. Which is now a much happier family!<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helped a bit, feel free to ask more!<br/>

&gt; My friend LeaAnn in Pensacola has unschooled three of her children for most<br/>
&gt; of their lives (Aaron is now 22 I believe, so it&#39;s been a while).:)<br/>
&gt; She wasn&#39;t single the entire time (her dh died over 10 years ago though)<br/>
&gt; but most of those years. She&#39;s been very creative in ways to make income and<br/>
&gt; be available to her children. She currently has a cottage industry that is<br/>
&gt; doing very well, selling handmade soaps, fulled and felted items:<br/>

&gt; I was a single unschooling Mum during the six months my dh and I were<br/>
&gt; separated in 2000. Not exactly the same, but I got a good taste of the<br/>
&gt; unique challenges being a single parent presents!<br/>

When Ray first came back from living with his bio mom we only asked him to do one thing, wash some dishes every day. We tried to be clear that we were asking, not telling him, and he *said* he wanted to help - but over time resentment built anyway. We kept expecting him to do dishes and reminding him to do them, and it gradually began to seem, to all of us, more like nagging than reminding. He started doing less dishes, and doing a half-a&#39;ed job. So we stopped reminding, stopped even mentioning dishes. George and I were imediately happier - we weren&#39;t nagging any more! Doing the dishes stopped being an Issue. It was probably a year, though, before Ray washed a dish again. Now he&#39;ll walk into the kitchen and start doing dishes entirely on his own. And now and again, when things are really piling up, we&#39;ll ask and he&#39;s happy to help out. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-745718192">Hi, Amy - <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been a single mom for over 5 years now; we&#39;ve been unschooling for 9 years.<br/>
<br/>
When my husband and I first separated, I was determined to keep unschooling. We lived on a very minimal budget, and I found work where I could. I worked with a temp. bartending service on the weekends the boys were with their dads, trying to get as many hours in as I could when they were not home. I did odd jobs here and there, babysat, helped a friend paint her house... <br/>
<br/>
All the while, learning more about radical unschooling, getting more and more in tune with my boys. I lucked into a job a few years ago... a friend needed someone to work in his office 10 - 15 hours a week. I talked it over with the boys, and they were OK with me going in. On the second day there, I realized it was a job I could do from home, and I went into my boss&#39;s office and asked if he would be willing to look at that. He was, I got a home office set up a few months later, and I&#39;ve been with them ever since.<br/>
<br/>
Both boys&#39; dads are in their lives, and I&#39;ve gotten regular child support all along (with a couple of exceptions, that were dealt with quickly). I have asked my friends for financial help several times. This wasn&#39;t a time that I could afford to be too proud to ask. I wouldn&#39;t have made it without that help. When I&#39;m more stable, I&#39;d love to set up an unschoolers help fund, a pot of money that would be used to help unschoolers in need. Right now, I need to focus on my family.<br/>
<br/>
Over the past few months, I&#39;ve realized as grateful as I am for this job, I&#39;m not liking how unavailable I am as I&#39;m working. I can do things for the boys, take frequent breaks, there&#39;s a lot of flexibility with my hours... but there are still several hours every weekday that I&#39;m not available to really BE with them.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m working with a life coach to help me reach my dream job, which would let me be with the boys more, earning a lot more per hour so I could work fewer hours.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trusting that as their needs change, I can recognize that and change things up, go with the flow to make a life we all love.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not perfect, but it&#39;s perfectly ours and it&#39;s really, really good. We need a car, now - I&#39;ve been without one for some time. My oldest has reached a point where he wants to be around people more, so I&#39;m trying to figure out how to make that happen. My youngest has always been social; we live in a neighborhood with kids his age so he&#39;s been able to play with them after their school time and on weekends. We would all benefit from being around unschoolers more, so I&#39;m keeping my eyes out for a miracle vehicle, and in the meantime learning how to save. I&#39;ve had to grow up a lot, in a lot of different ways, to make this work.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s been an undercurrent lately in some unschooling messages that if you don&#39;t have a perfect life, you&#39;re not doing your kids any favors by unschooling. I call bulls**t. My boys love unschooling, and the freedom it provides. It&#39;s not just for privileged, two-parent families.<br/>
<br/>
They see through their schooled friends what they would have dealt with in school, and are very grateful to have lived our unconventional life instead. We talk a lot about choices - we just had to take our kitty to the vet, and sadly, had to have him put down. Before we took him in, the boys said they&#39;d rather pay the vet bill than the cable bill; he was definitely more important than Nicktoons Network and the DVR. Would I like to provide both? Yes, and I&#39;m seeing if I can get some extra hours to do that. But if I can&#39;t, it will be OK, we&#39;ll work it out. We always do.<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>
Caren</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe that got read into what was said, but no one intended that.<br/>
<br/>
What people were saying was that when there&#39;s a *choice* between  <br/>
better and not so good, not so good isn&#39;t as good as better.<br/>
<br/>
You might be referring to the daycare? If the daycare were a  <br/>
necessity to bring in money, then daycare might be better than other  <br/>
options like working outside the home. She got to stay home with her  <br/>
kids. That&#39;s a better thing than being gone. :-) But if the daycare  <br/>
isn&#39;t a necessity, the downsides may not outweigh the negatives.<br/>
<br/>
I think women were handed a huge disservice by the idea that daycare  <br/>
is just as good as being at home. It&#39;s not. It can&#39;t be. But daycare  <br/>
is better than the whole family living under a bridge in a box. (If  <br/>
those aren&#39;t the only two options!)<br/>
<br/>
You do what&#39;s best with the options you have. But if you don&#39;t  <br/>
examine the negatives of what you&#39;re choosing you can&#39;t choose better  <br/>
if something else comes along.<br/>
