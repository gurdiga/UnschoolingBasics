<div id="ygrps-yiv-1159687565">My family was at this campout and two of my kids are in the photo, <br/>
far left top and bottom.  Just wanted to share a good unschooling article<br/>
with quotes from unschooled kids/teens and parents.   ~Kathy<br/>

Hey campers!<br/>
<br/>
Many of you talked to the UC Santa Cruz reporter who was doing the <br/>
article about unschooling. Well, here&#39;s the link to the article:<br/>

I thought it was pretty darn good except for one slightly mangled <br/>
quote from me and the fact that she painted HSC and the campout as an <br/>
unschooler&#39;s gathering. I sent her a clarification (see below). (I <br/>
thought I had made it clear that it was a homeschoolers campout but <br/>
there would be many unschoolers there but I guess that got lost. I <br/>
was just excited that we&#39;d be in her neck of the woods and she could <br/>
interview people in person.)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks Rachel! I&#39;ve read lots of articles on unschooling and yours <br/>
&gt;was one of the best I&#39;ve ever seen! You really captured the essence <br/>
&gt;and the enthusiasm of unschooling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;One little clarification for the benefit of the Homeschool <br/>
&gt;Association of California that sponsored the campout: HSC is not an <br/>
&gt;unschooling organization but a support organization for all <br/>
&gt;homeschoolers in CA and while many of the families there were <br/>
&gt;unschoolers, it wasn&#39;t specifically an unschoolers gathering. HSC <br/>
&gt;can be a little touchy about that!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But thanks for the fabulous article. It&#39;s great that you quoted so <br/>
&gt;many kids. Did the article come out yesterday? Please let me know <br/>
&gt;if there&#39;s any feedback or letters to the editor. Sometimes people <br/>
&gt;have strong reactions!<br/>
