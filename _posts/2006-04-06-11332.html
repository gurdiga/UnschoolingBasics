<div id="ygrps-yiv-922878447">We&#39;re slowly slipping into an unschooling mindset over here, but there are<br/>
dozens of things that aren&#39;t there yet.  One area I&#39;m having particular<br/>
trouble with is nighttime/bedtime.  I&#39;m hoping to get some insight and<br/>
thoughts about this from the experienced unschoolers here.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have two boys, almost 7 and almost 3 who share a bedroom.  I used to let<br/>
Drew (the older one) stay up and read or play quietly until he fell asleep.<br/>
Then when Josh was 18 months we started transitioning him into the shared<br/>
bedroom (out of our bed).  At that point we didn&#39;t allow them to stay up,<br/>
because Josh couldn&#39;t do the &quot;read or play quietly&quot; bit.  In hindsight I<br/>
probably should have moved Drew into my room to read until he fell asleep<br/>
and then moved him into his bed once he did.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
In any case, now that Josh is almost 3, I realized that he could probably do<br/>
the &quot;read or play quietly&quot; bit.  We started that about a week ago, and<br/>
initially it went really really well.  The past few nights, however, have<br/>
been less than stellar.  Drew is fine, it&#39;s Josh that is having trouble.<br/>
He&#39;s bothering Drew, throwing things at him, getting wild, etc.  This is an<br/>
issue with him during the day as well (that age, ugh!).  I can handle it in<br/>
the daytime fairly well, but once nighttime comes around, I&#39;m flat out<br/>
exhausted.  To continue going in there every 5 minutes to pull Josh off<br/>
Drew, or get him to settle down, is making me crazy.  Last night I really<br/>
lost it and started yelling (another issue I have in general, I&#39;m a<br/>
hot-tempered sort).  I felt horrible afterwards, of course.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So.how do I do this??  I don&#39;t want to force people to go to sleep when they<br/>
aren&#39;t sleepy.  But I need a break from the constant handling of Joshua&#39;s<br/>
spirited self, and at night I&#39;m just so tired that my patience is almost<br/>
nonexistant.  I&#39;m sure this involves a shift in thinking for ME, but I&#39;m<br/>
having a really hard time making it.  Insight please. :-)<br/>

<br/>
Michelle--I haven&#39;t introduced myself here yet and we&#39;re not unschooling as of yet. But just a thought, could you put Josh to sleep in his bed and let Drew sit quietly somewhere else until he&#39;s ready to go to sleep? We have a quiet/comfy area out in the hallway where people can do this. However,I am pretty strong about bedtimes around here,because I see that ds&#39;s(5.5 and 3) could stay up alot later and then it really affects their behavior the next day (sometimes for days afterward,weeks, and no I&#39;m not kidding-- one late night can have a bad effect for a couple of months for my older son!)      Good luck,Kim<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-55274104">Two possible brainstormy ideas.<br/>
 <br/>
First, is there any way they could NOT share a bedroom? (I suspect the  <br/>
answer is no, but just in case you really do have an extra room....)   That&#39;s a big <br/>
developmental range, a seven year old and a toddler. If Drew  doesn&#39;t have to <br/>
share that space, he will probably like his little brother a lot  more. <br/>
 <br/>
If not, why do they have to be in the bedroom? Could Drew find another  place <br/>
in the house to read or play quietly? And it sounds like Josh really wants  <br/>
to be playing with someone during that time, and he teases Drew to try to <br/>
engage  him. Right on developmentally, but irritating to Drew.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m not a big Bedtime advocate, but maybe for a little while for the sake  of <br/>
your family a quiet bedtime routine for Josh is in order. You say you need  <br/>
some downtime after a busy day with active Josh, and so does Drew. So maybe <br/>
Drew  stays up reading or playing quietly in the living room, and you can give <br/>
Josh  some mellowing time to get sleepy and settle in with stories, etc. Maybe <br/>
that  would be a good task for another parent, if one is around? You could have <br/>
some  quiet time with Drew and your partner some with Josh? If there isn&#39;t <br/>
another  parent around, that routine and a (temporary, until Josh is really <br/>
ready for  quiet time by himself) earlier bedtime for him might be especially <br/>
important.  It&#39;s better for Josh to have a sane mommy, and that bedtime routine <br/>
could turn  out to be some of your happiest memories, and his.<br/>
