Hi Kathryn....<br/>
<br/>
My children were 5, 8 & 11 (we adopted them as siblings) when the <br/>
adoption was finalized. That was in Oct. of 2003. <br/>
We didn&#39;t have other children before them so no, we weren&#39;t <br/>
unschooling at that time. <br/>
<br/>
Adopting older children (any child over the age of 2 is considered <br/>
older) is not easy but in the end it can work out to be the most <br/>
rewarding thing you&#39;ve done with your life. These children have been <br/>
through things (in their biological home and/or in foster care) that <br/>
we only have nightmares about and it changes them. When their abuse <br/>
and neglect happens during an age span where major development, they <br/>
don&#39;t develop as they they should have. One of the major issues we <br/>
deal with is attachment disorder. <br/>
<br/>
Removing them from school is the best thing we&#39;ve done for them. My <br/>
children (mostly the older two) are very easily influenced and <br/>
pursuaded plus, having attachment disorder makes them &quot;trust&quot; <br/>
strangers more than us so having them in school was not helping them <br/>
heal. They thrive on routine and knowing what is expected of them. <br/>
We have to actually re-parent them. <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll have to decide what you CAN&#39;T handle if you decide to adopt <br/>
older kids. We knew that we couldn&#39;t handle animal abuse or severe <br/>
violence and we told the case workers that. My older two children <br/>
deal with the effects of sexual abuse and we have to parent them <br/>
accordingly. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not all bad though! LOL I just believe in going into this with <br/>
open eyes. My kids are healing and making progress every day. <br/>
<br/>
I have an active and private online community for adoptive parents <br/>
(and also those who want to adopt) if you&#39;re interested in more <br/>
information. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1836511622">I realised in re-reading my post I left part of a sentence off.<br/>
<br/>
I said:<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;When their abuse<br/>
and neglect happens during an age span where major development, they<br/>
don&#39;t develop as they they should have. One of the major issues we<br/>
deal with is attachment disorder.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I meant to say...&quot;during an age span where major development is <br/>
happening...&quot;. When a child, during the ages of birth and about 2, is <br/>
not given the opportunity to bond with their primary care giver, they <br/>
can develop attachment disorder. Both of my older ones have RAD <br/>
(reactive attachment disorder) but they don&#39;t have it so severe that <br/>
they can not heal. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway...I hope this answers your questions. :-) Feel free to contact <br/>
me if you have any more!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1427054159">Hi Kathryn,<br/>
We have adopted 5 kids. They were ages 3 months, 1 yr, 18 months, 3 yrs, and <br/>
6 yrs when they came to live with us.  I can definitely tell the difference <br/>
between the youngest 4 and the oldest.   Our oldest adopted is now 15 and <br/>
went thru years of problems.  But as far as the schooling portion of <br/>
things......... our youngest birth child was in public school until 2nd <br/>
grade.  We made the decision to pull him with the help of my best friend <br/>
(who was a great unschooler....... her two are all grown up now).  When we <br/>
pulled him our other children were still foster children and the state <br/>
wouldn&#39;t allow them to be pulled, but as soon as the papers were signed out <br/>
they came.   Our 15 yr old needed to be pulled long before the adoption was <br/>
finalized.  But our social worker was questioning our homeschooling thru the <br/>
process, so when the question came up as to whether we were planning on <br/>
pulling the boys I outright lied.  Told her no,  with her line of <br/>
questioning I believe she would have given us an extremely hard time <br/>
throughout the adoption if we had told them before the ink was to be dried <br/>
they were coming home to stay and not return to public school.   And yes, I <br/>
know that was being dishonest but in the interest of the kids we did what we <br/>
had to do.  The other thing is when I pulled my youngest bio child I did the <br/>
school at home thing....... but over the years we are walking more and more <br/>
down the unschooling path.  Its taken us awhile to get here but I try real <br/>
hard not to let that public school thinking I was brought up in sneak in and <br/>
take over :)<br/>
If there is anything else I help with (or you just need to vent or question) <br/>
drop me a line.<br/>
