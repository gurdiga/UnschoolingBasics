Anyway, I see Harry Potter as my reward that I get to read right  <br/>
before I go to sleep. I look forward to it all day and enjoy my <br/>
habit  of nightly reading. I keep reading the books over and over, <br/>
and eventually  I will have to find something else.<br/>

Eragon and Eldest are two good books.  They were written by a  homeschooled <br/>
teen and I read them for that reason.  They are fantasy  fiction, not my usual <br/>
genre but I really enjoyed them.  The author&#39;s name  is:  Christopher Paolini <br/>
(if I remember correctly, names are not my  thing)  BTW I really enjoyed the <br/>
Harry Potter books as  well.<br/>
