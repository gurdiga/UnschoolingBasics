<div id="ygrps-yiv-2098584966">&quot; Lately I have been telling him that it is my job to keep this family safe and if he&#39;s not going to help me do that than he&#39;s going to need to leave the room or find a<br/>
different activity elsewhere.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I do the same thing. <br/>
Depending on the age of the child, I might ask them to find another space to be in (if they&#39;ve ignored my requests to quit) or I simply take that person in another room with me and try to find a distraction, or have a conversation about how I can help them get into a good place (or at least quit trying to bring everyone else into a bad place!).<br/>
