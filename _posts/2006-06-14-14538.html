<div id="ygrps-yiv-1887063324">Okay, I may be a newbie and all but I would like to point this out:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the unschoolingbasics list. We look forward to sharing<br/>
information and ideas with you, but first, we ask you to look over our<br/>
posting and list guidelines:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
1) No discussions will be allowed about posts. This is called a<br/>
&quot;meta-discussion&quot; (discussing the discussion) and posts analyzing another<br/>
person&#39;s post or posting style will be rejected. If there is something about<br/>
a post that bothers you, stick to discussing the ideas presented, rather<br/>
than the post itself.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
2)  Please only post issues/topics that you are open to discussing. If it&#39;s<br/>
in your message, it&#39;s open to discussion.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;desperately hiding the innate sarcasm that springs forth&gt;<br/>
<br/>
