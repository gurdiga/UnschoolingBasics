<div id="ygrps-yiv-1289116685">Hi Melissa,<br/>
Everyone manages their pasions different ways. As a single mom in NYC, I<br/>
share a house with my mother, who helps raise my two year old girl, work<br/>
part time at a job I LOVE (which also gives me health insurance) and then<br/>
waitress a few nights a week for extra cash, which leaves me 4 free days a<br/>
week to spend with my girl. The rest of the time she&#39;s either with my<br/>
mother, or a sweet college student babysitter that spends mornings with<br/>
her...Is waitressing a possibnility where you are? It&#39;s fast cash, sometimes<br/>
off the books, and if your kids&#39; dad is home he can do the evening shift<br/>
with them...<br/>
Best of luck...<br/>
Britt<br/>
