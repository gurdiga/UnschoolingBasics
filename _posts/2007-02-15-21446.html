<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Yes, he does get crabby with how hard it is, but that&#39;s actually helping him<br/>
work through his frustrations when things get hard. He is getting good at<br/>
stopping, taking a minute, then going back and trying again. When he is<br/>
trying something hard IRL, I ask him what Yoda would do in the game and he<br/>
keeps trying. I don&#39;t want them simpler I would like them without<br/>
shooting/blasting/chopping up people. When he plays with us he says things<br/>
like, &quot;I am going to chop your head off&quot; which is something they do with<br/>
their light sabers in the game. We are letting him know that is not okay to<br/>
play like that, but I think having him play other things with his dad will<br/>
help, also. I know he is only 5 and doesn&#39;t mean that he would hurt someone,<br/>
but it makes me very uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Am I just over reacting like my husband says I am? Am I trying to shield him<br/>
too much?<br/>

<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well, Zoombini&#39;s is NOT simpler---it&#39;s calculus and algebra and logic <br/>
and sequencing. No words---even pre-readers love it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
When he plays with us he says things<br/>
like, &quot;I am going to chop your head off&quot; which is something they do with<br/>
their light sabers in the game. We are letting him know that is not <br/>
okay to<br/>
play like that,<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yeah---but do you think he&#39;d actually cut your head off? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think *HE* knows it&#39;s not OK to play like that for *real*---I think <br/>
he knows more about play than *you*! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The DS game, NintenDogs is a hard one for me to get by. In my HEAD, I <br/>
know they&#39;re just pixels---they&#39;re not REAL dogs. But for some reason <br/>
(I guess just by being an immigrant in this techno-world &lt;g&gt;), I have a <br/>
hard time when the dogs get fleas or need to go for a walk.<br/>
<br/>
One of Duncan&#39;s friends decided to starve one of his NintenDogs to <br/>
death---to see how far it would allow him to take it. The dog was skin <br/>
and bones (well, pixelly!&lt;G&gt;), and would crrraawwwllll along the floor <br/>
whining and begging as he fed the other dogs. My heart was breaking. It <br/>
was HORRIBLE! But, as I learned, &quot;It&#39;s a GAME. Mom. They&#39;re not REAL!&quot; <br/>
I know, I know, but I&#39;m not *OF* this generation!<br/>
<br/>
I know this boy would *never* treat his own dogs that way. It was a <br/>
game, and he wanted to push the game as far as it would allow.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 but I think having him play other things with his dad will help, also.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Sure: the more, the merrier. More games? Cool! &lt;g&gt; Just don&#39;t be too <br/>
disappointed if they aren&#39;t played as often as the other ones!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I know he is only 5 and doesn&#39;t mean that he would hurt someone,<br/>
but it makes me very uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I know. Me too. But I&#39;m getting over it. I&#39;d rather watch Harry Potter <br/>
toss garden pixies over the wall than see the Godfather shoot-em-ups. <br/>
But that&#39;s what Duncan likes---and he&#39;s a VERY gentle child IRL.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Am I just over reacting like my husband says I am? Am I trying to <br/>
shield him<br/>
too much?<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Yes. Yes. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But get some more games. Maybe ones *you&#39;d* be willing to play with <br/>
him. He might forgo the violence to hang with you a bit. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Simon and Linnaea, who are sweet and wonderful people, can murder us in the <br/>
most innovative and violent ways when we strap our swords on and go up the <br/>
road to a set of ruins dating at least to the 1100&#39;s. Violent play is very <br/>
different from violent real. Saying I&#39;m going to chop off your head is <br/>
nothing like the real thing. Really.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-245049858">My kids enjoyed putt-putt games. Also Spy Fox and<br/>
Pajama Sam. They&#39;re all problem-solving type of games.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with Kelly. I doubt the violence is affecting<br/>
him in a negative way. It is fantasy and kids know it<br/>
is fantasy.<br/>
<br/>
I read a book called &quot;Killing Monsters&quot; by Gerard<br/>
Jones who argues that the fantasy is good for kids. He<br/>
has studied all the studies about violent media and<br/>
kids and there&#39;s little to no co-relation between the<br/>
play and kids&#39; behaviours. He also talked a lot with<br/>
real kids about why they enjoyed those games. The book<br/>
is kind of repetative and not worth buying in my<br/>
opinion. But it definitely helped me be more<br/>
comfortable with all the violent shows that my kids<br/>
like to watch. You may be able to borrow it from your<br/>
library. Here&#39;s an article by the same author that you<br/>
can read online.<br/>

I brought it here &#39;cause too many people won&#39;t go look. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
**********************************************************<br/>
<br/>
Great Britain passed the Juvenile Offences Act of 1847 which said young <br/>
people shouldn&#39;t go to the same prison as adults. They did it because <br/>
of public concern over the huge numbers of young kids going to jail <br/>
(not just on murder charges) with adult criminals. Some figures show <br/>
the crime rate in England jumped from 5,000 crimes a year around 1800 <br/>
to 20,000 a year sometime in the 1830s. No one can blame tv for that <br/>
one.<br/>
Fourteen year old Jesse Pomeroy was arrested in 1874 for the murder of <br/>
a four-year-old. He was released and immediately killed a ten year old <br/>
girl and then another four year old. No tv.<br/>
<br/>
In 1924 nineteen year olds Richard Loeb and Nathan Leopold murdered <br/>
Bobby Franks just to see what it was like. They were from well off <br/>
families, nice neighborhoods. Never saw tv.<br/>
<br/>
In Bath, Michigan in May, 1927 Andrew Kehoe who was fifty (five?- don&#39;t <br/>
remember) committed the worst case of school violence in American <br/>
history. First he killed his wife, locked his animals in the barn and <br/>
blew them up, blew up the school where he was a handyman and blew up <br/>
his truck full of shrapnel. More explosives were set to go off to kill <br/>
rescue workers but were found by the police. In all, thirty eight <br/>
children were killed and seven teachers. Sixty some others were <br/>
injured. Mr. Kehoe never saw a tv set.<br/>
<br/>
Does TV create violence, really? Maybe guns create violence. Knives. <br/>
Baseball bats. Hammers. Axes, shovels, saws? Rope? Dynamite? Sharp <br/>
sticks, rocks? Maybe it&#39;s language causes violence because most killers <br/>
spoke. Maybe it&#39;s books. Clothing? Day time night time wind rain snow <br/>
trees birds frogs.<br/>
<br/>
History is full of killers, some really damn weird ones who never saw <br/>
TV. The Borgias come to mind easily, and so maybe religion or <br/>
Pope-ness, Pope hood? is the cause of crime.<br/>
<br/>
For lots of kids, even the bad guys on TV are nicer than the real life <br/>
crazy people they live and go to school with.<br/>

Kids have been pretending violence since the beginning of time. You  <br/>
can&#39;t stop him from having the feelings and wanting to *play* them  <br/>
out. But you can make him feel guilty about having normal feelings.  <br/>
You can make him hide his pretend play.<br/>
<br/>
*He* knows the difference between an image striking an image on the  <br/>
screen and a real person striking a real person. He&#39;s probably  <br/>
wondering why you have a problem with telling the difference between  <br/>
the two.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Real life anecdote from our house recently: my 8 1/2 yr old DS has <br/>
been playing Lego Star Wars (I and II), 007 games (rated T but no <br/>
gory bloodshed), and other such things since he was 5 and we got a <br/>
PS2. When he was a toddler, he chewed his toast into a &#39;pewer&#39; <br/>
(listen closely to the sci-fi laser weapons). Most of his pretend <br/>
play involves some sort of battle - Bionicles, toilet paper tubes, <br/>
you name it, we battle with it.<br/>
<br/>
Last week DS and I were watching FutureWeapons (cool stuff there) <br/>
and during a commercial break, where there were several ads for <br/>
various branches of the military, I asked DS (who has a former <br/>
Marine corporal and a former Air Force captain for grandpas), if <br/>
he&#39;s ever thought he might consider being in the military. He paused <br/>
and said &quot;I like pretend battles but I don&#39;t want to be in the <br/>
middle of a real one&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Compared to his schooled, TV and videogame limited agemates/friends, <br/>
he is the least violent of them all. Seems to me (from my admittedly <br/>
biased viewpoint) that the lack of self-determination of those <br/>
schooled kids is more a factor in violent behaviors than whether or <br/>
not they watch TV or play violent videogames.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-310796336">Lori, when you say the violence is affecting him in a negative way, do you mean that he&#39;s actually *being* more violent when he&#39;s frustrated or do you mean that he&#39;s playing more violently?<br/>
<br/>
I noticed when my boys were first introduced to Dungeons and Dragons that they (especially the younger ones) were fascinated with the weaponry and fighting.  As they&#39;ve gotten more and more into the game and their knowledge has become more sophisticated that has diminished.  I also remember that after 9-11 my then 5yo did a lot of playing that planes were crashing into buildings.  Dh was *not* happy with me for telling ds about the crashes!  (He never actually saw any of the real photos -- even I&#39;ve never seen the live footage.)  I think that when they are first exposed to something like this they have a need to play it out a lot.  It&#39;s their way of making sense of it, of understanding and coping with life.  It&#39;s hard for us when it&#39;s violence they&#39;re playing -- we don&#39;t have any trouble with their playing at nurturing a doll or flying and airplane -- but I really believe they&#39;re just processing something new in their environment.  <br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s actually treating anyone violently, that&#39;s a diffent issue though.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.<br/>

Just saw your second post.  Have you read Larry Cohen&#39;s Playful Parenting?  He addresses this issue at length.  There was also a good article on gun play in Mothering magazine, maybe the Nov/Dec issue.<br/>

&gt; Yes, he does get crabby with how hard it is, but that&#39;s actually  <br/>
&gt; helping him<br/>
&gt; work through his frustrations when things get hard. He is getting  <br/>
&gt; good at<br/>
&gt; stopping, taking a minute, then going back and trying again. When  <br/>
&gt; he is<br/>
&gt; trying something hard IRL, I ask him what Yoda would do in the game  <br/>
&gt; and he<br/>
&gt; keeps trying. I don&#39;t want them simpler I would like them without<br/>
&gt; shooting/blasting/chopping up people. When he plays with us he says  <br/>
&gt; things<br/>
&gt; like, &quot;I am going to chop your head off&quot; which is something they do  <br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; their light sabers in the game. We are letting him know that is not  <br/>
&gt; okay to<br/>
&gt; play like that, but I think having him play other things with his  <br/>
&gt; dad will<br/>
&gt; help, also. I know he is only 5 and doesn&#39;t mean that he would hurt  <br/>
&gt; someone,<br/>
&gt; but it makes me very uncomfortable.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am looking for a non-violent video game that my 6 year old can<br/>
&gt; play on his<br/>
&gt; PC. He likes to play Leggo Star Wars 2 with his dad, but I would like<br/>
&gt; to see<br/>
&gt; him get away from the violence or at least not play it every day.  <br/>
&gt; It is<br/>
&gt; affecting him in a negative way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It may not be the violence that&#39;s effecting him negatively---it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; probably just the level of difficulty. I can get pretty crabby when<br/>
&gt; what *I* am working on isn&#39;t going well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But as for suggestions: ZOOMBINI&#39;S!<br/>
