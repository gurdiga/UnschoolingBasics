<div id="ygrps-yiv-1718785642">How nice that your dad was able to make that change (and still support<br/>
the family) and that your mom was supportive of it!<br/>
<br/>
My dh grumbles about going to work -- but says he enjoys it. <br/>
Personally, I hate the grumbling, the implications he makes that my<br/>
life is so much cushier because I don&#39;t have to get up every morning<br/>
to go to the office (mind you, I&#39;m usually awake BEFORE he is!) -- if<br/>
he wanted to strike off and try starting his own business doing<br/>
something he loved, I would be all for it.  But he doesn&#39;t want to do<br/>
that -- so he grumbles.  Maybe he just likes grumbling....<br/>

How to make a &quot;paying career&quot; out of that if you&#39;re not pro level? He <br/>
works for a sporting goods mfr/distributor. He&#39;s got the West <br/>

Alaska, Hawaii, California, the Pacific Northwest and goes hunting, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-748659500">What a great bunch of examples here :D<br/>
People will follow their passions or they won&#39;t.<br/>
People who have passions endorsed and supported by their loved ones are<br/>
*MORE* likely to follow those passions deep into life.<br/>
People who have their passions quashed and belittled have a harder time<br/>
finding them again deeper into life.<br/>
I&#39;m on the side of fostering passions.<br/>
Even if they&#39;re not *mine*- no - Especially if they&#39;re not mine and they<br/>
belong to someone I love.<br/>
<br/>
When choosing what to say to your children, think: Am I giving Judgment or<br/>
Joy? - Go with the comment that brings Joy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1153925395">My mom used to work as a nurse at a hospital in northern Virginia.  I don&#39;t<br/>
remember this but she often tells us how she used to come home and gripe<br/>
about her job and one day I asked her if she hated it why she didn&#39;t just<br/>
find a better job.  She hadn&#39;t thought of it, but she went right out and did<br/>
it.  She has created many interesting jobs for herself since then - teaching<br/>
nursing, performing bone marrow transplants, helping launch an oncology<br/>
clinic, giving breast cancer seminars, and (my favorite) traveling through<br/>
the Mississippi Delta doing telemedicine:  she recruits a team of<br/>
specialists at the med center in Little Rock, and then takes video<br/>
conferencing equipment and a tech and travles through the small poorest<br/>
towns, linking these people to the specialists who gather in a conference<br/>
room for the virtual exams.  Many of these people would never go to the city<br/>
or go see a specialist.  It sounds so rewarding!  Now she is alternatively<br/>
going to go back to law school and combine that with nursing in some way, or<br/>
quit all together and invent this toy she&#39;s had an idea for for a few years.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
The point is there are so many options in most fields, you just have to let<br/>
your mind wander through the possibilities.  <br/>
 <br/>
I enjoyed the book &quot;Wishcraft&quot; for getting some good ideas started.<br/>

Unschooling (Live and Learn, 2004) conference I attended. She&#39;d not heard of<br/>
unschooling before us, but when her sons were growing up they only had two<br/>
rules at her house: 1)Don&#39;t break my stuff, 2) Take responsibility if you<br/>
do. If she&#39;d heard anything about unschooling then, she has no doubt she<br/>
would have raised her sons this way. Pretty amazing woman!<br/>
