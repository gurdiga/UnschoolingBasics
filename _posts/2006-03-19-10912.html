a safe child than a lost child.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. I used to say &quot;better a leash than a toe tag&quot;.<br/>
I really don&#39;t like those damn things, BUT I think they could be used<br/>
respectfully, and give the child more roaming space while keeping them<br/>
more safe.<br/>
<br/>
If you make them hold your hand in an unsafe place, a leash really<br/>
gives them a bit more space to move. As long as you follow them where<br/>
they want to explore, it could be ok I suppose.<br/>
<br/>
My thing is that it seems like something you&#39;d do to a pet and I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t want my child feeling like I was treating them like a lesser<br/>
being.<br/>

comment on leashes.  I used to have a friend who would say, &quot;If a <br/>
child wants to go with you, then a leash isn&#39;t necessary.  If a child <br/>

<br/>
One of our children used to be a &quot;dawdler.&quot;  She was in no hurry to <br/>
get anywhere.  She took (and still takes) life at her own speed.  When <br/>
we would go to Disney World, this could be a problem as she would be <br/>
one step behind me, then 2, then 5, then somewhere else altogether.  <br/>
We solved this by attaching bells to her shoes.  (Actually we had them <br/>
on both the girl&#39;s shoes, but had jingle bells on one and small cow-<br/>
looking bells on the other - different sounds.)  We could tell when <br/>
she was lagging behind or had gotten &quot;off course.&quot;  She loved her <br/>
shoes (she had tennis shoes that I had painted like cow print) and her <br/>
bells and would ring them for everyone.  Our other child thought that <br/>
her bells were wonderful because it was like having little fairies at <br/>
her toes.  And we never lost either of them this way.  It was a great <br/>
auditory reminder of where our children were.  We later implimented <br/>
this same bell theory with our son.   <br/>

Yeah. That&#39;s my problem with them. I think that many times parents<br/>
take children into places they aren&#39;t ready to be in. If a child isn&#39;t<br/>
prepared for a crowded place, it might be better to wait until they&#39;re<br/>
older. <br/>
Or follow the child to the places they&#39;re interested in.<br/>
<br/>
I can see how on occasion, a parent is just trying to keep a child<br/>
safe while they know they&#39;ll be distracted in a crowd, or with several<br/>
children. I just don&#39;t think they&#39;re the most respectful way to keep a<br/>
child safe.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, I would agree partly. The other part is that when we go to fairs and<br/>
festivals - my son wants to look at everything and while I don&#39;t have a<br/>
problem with that when we enter a crowded booth he could get places I<br/>
couldn&#39;t and sometimes I couldn&#39;t see him. My hearing isn&#39;t all that great<br/>
especially in crowds - 30% hearing loss from childhood ear infections.<br/>
<br/>
With my son I never really worried that someone would &quot;pick him up and run<br/>
off with him.&quot; He was a heavy sack o&#39; taters and built like a brick. He has<br/>
a sense of strangers and while he will talk to anyone - he even interrupted<br/>
me to see if a man at a Ren Faire could give him a piece of candy he was<br/>
offered. My daughter is a different story. She is very tall 75 percentile<br/>
but only 25 percentile for weight. I might be able to locate her by her<br/>
siren scream but if she likes them I would never see her again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-27340617">Everyone asks why my kids are so good at the mall, it&#39;s really  <br/>
because we rarely force them to go when they don&#39;t want to. When we  <br/>
go they want to be there. We usually wind up entertaining some poor  <br/>
kids hiding in the rack while their moms go through the clothes. LOL!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1845826259">I think a leash would be a last resort if the kid really balked at it.  But I also think that using a leash is no different than using seatbelts, strollers, etc.. A lot of it (like almost everything) depends on your child&#39;s nature and the number the kids you have.<br/>
<br/>
Out of 5 kids, I have 2 that disappear regularly.  At ages 9 and 7, I am still tracking them down at the park, at the store, at the mall.  They have zero fear of situations or strangers.  We just didn&#39;t go a lot of places when they were small.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1502495733">I don&#39;t know that that is fair. Now I am not much of a shopper, I do most of<br/>
it online if I can or at least the pricing by phone - go to store - pick it<br/>
up - go home. However, I do like to get out of the house and my son loves<br/>
coming too. I do try to compromise like doing what I want until Lunch and<br/>
then doing what he wants after lunch.<br/>
<br/>
Not that I am not saying we spend all day at the Ren like we used to before<br/>
he was born maybe two to four hours at best or going to the State Fair once<br/>
or twice instead of being there all week. If the kids start getting cranky<br/>
it is time to go home.<br/>
<br/>
I am trying to get to a question here because I want to fully understand<br/>
your point of view.<br/>
<br/>
While crowded places aren&#39;t always my cup of tea, my son loves going out<br/>
anywhere there are people. Most of them ignore him when he trys to talk to<br/>
them. Busy with their own lives usually only elderly take the time to talk<br/>
to my very friendly full of questions child. My daughter also has a flair<br/>
and loves being around people. While my daughter isn&#39;t old enough to<br/>
understand barriers or staying close to an adult.<br/>
<br/>
My son (five and half) is known to get distracted or go to look at something<br/>
and forget to tell someone. These days he has gotten better about letting us<br/>
know he wants to look at something instead of wandering off but if we hadn&#39;t<br/>
been on outings since he was small, I don&#39;t know if he would be as good as<br/>
he is now.<br/>
<br/>
My concern is always that maybe I am looking at it wrong. Should we be<br/>
keeping the kids in more and go out less? How old should they be? How do you<br/>
know when they are ready? Does that include keeping them at home when I run<br/>
errands? How does anyone get anything done if you have to keep the kids at<br/>
home instead of going out?<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m talking about the kids who is strapped to a stroller and forced <br/>
to &quot;sit and be good&quot; so that mom can do some &quot;leisurely&quot; shopping <br/>
for herself.  I can&#39;t tell you the number of times I have heard <br/>
womyn bitch and complain about how badly their children are acting <br/>
out when their child has been dragged through the mall all day, not <br/>
had any of his needs met (let alone wants), and the only attention <br/>
s/he has gotten from mom has been to be yelled out because they are <br/>
fussing!  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had to take an unwilling to child to the store before for <br/>
something that was needed (such as medicine or food for a meal) and <br/>
it isn&#39;t any fun.  So why would I want to do this on a regular basis <br/>
or all day?  Why should I drag my child through a store and make <br/>
him/her wait while I try on shoes or clothes or price compare?  It&#39;s <br/>
no fun for me, my child, or the other patrons of that store.  <br/>
<br/>
At what age should you take your child to the mall?  That&#39;s up to <br/>
you.  But unschooling tells us that forcing our children to endure <br/>
activities that neither interest them or are comfortable for them is <br/>
just not wrong.  Some children would love going shopping with mom.  <br/>
They would be all immersed into the &quot;art of shoe shopping&quot; and find <br/>
trying on countless pairs of shoes fun and entertaining.  Other (I <br/>
might even say most) children would be bored to tears and find it <br/>
insufferable.  I also don&#39;t think that I should make my child &quot;be <br/>
good&quot; so that they can do something that they enjoy afterwards.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m fortunate now that my children are old enough to stay home alone <br/>
for more than an hour at a time.  When I have a shopping venture <br/>
that I want to run they have the option of going or staying home.  <br/>
They know that if they come that it might be boring to them and that <br/>
they are going somewhere that they have no interest in.  Sometimes, <br/>
they just want to go to spend a little time with me or they may feel <br/>
housebound because of weather or health issues that going office <br/>
supply shopping with mom is more exciting than spending another <br/>
minute in the house.  <br/>
<br/>
I hope that is a little clearer mud,<br/>
