But what  about all of the children who SEEM to need structure to get through <br/>
their days  and for whom doctors advise structure and rules?<br/>

Hi Linda, first of all, a plug for the Shine with Unschooling  yahoo  list.  <br/>
We discuss these matters in depth.<br/>
 <br/>
With my non-typical child, I ask for what I need/want from him.  He is  <br/>
always free to say no.  I say &quot;would you like to help me bring in the  groceries?&quot;  <br/>
We are now at a level when I can negotiate a &quot;no&quot; response if  I need to <br/>
(where he is still free to say no).<br/>
 <br/>
Sometimes he helps alot, sometimes not so much.  Also, my son is  usually <br/>
more likely to follow his dad&#39;s lead than mine.  A few years ago,  my DH started <br/>
helping my son keep his room clean.  Now my son does it  almost daily without <br/>
much thought.<br/>
 <br/>
Routine and structure could also be softened into pattern and  <br/>
predictability.  What patterns and predictability in your lives does your  child need to <br/>
feel safe?  What routine and structure are imposed because  you feel you *have* <br/>
to?<br/>
