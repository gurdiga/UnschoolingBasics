<div id="ygrps-yiv-162757567">Does anyone have any information about either of these groups?  I&#39;m thinking<br/>
of starting an Earth Scout or Spiral Scout group in my area and would like<br/>
to know if anyone here is involved and would have any helpful information on<br/>
how best to get started.<br/>
