You admit that unschooling and schooling at home (which has many <br/>
forms) are polar opposites, yet you think that you can somehow make <br/>
that rift disappear?<br/>
That makes no sense.<br/>
I think you are doing a grave disservice to unschooling as a <br/>
philosophy, by watering down lists, refusing to actually endorse <br/>
unschooling as a more effective form of education and trying to stay <br/>
on some non-existant middle ground.<br/>
<br/>
This list IS to discuss unschooling.<br/>
I will always support unschooling over general homeschooling, <br/>
because I do believe unschooling is a better way to live.<br/>
I have no money to make by supporting unschooling over other <br/>
methods, I do it because I BELIEVE in it.<br/>
<br/>
So let&#39;s get on to discussing unschooling. That&#39;s what we&#39;re here <br/>
for, and that&#39;s the kind of focused information that is going to be <br/>
most helpful to those trying to learn about this lifestyle.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well.... the resounding response to what I wrote the other day tells <br/>
me otherwise. If you&#39;re interested I&#39;ll share some of them with you - <br/>
or anyone - onlist or off. But I warn you: It&#39;s pretty eye-opening <br/>
reading, from some of the most respected voices in homeschooling and <br/>
unschooling.<br/>

who knows anything about our work over the last 20 years knows that <br/>
&quot;making money by supporting a method&quot; is not what this is about. This <br/>
is about looking at the big picture and not getting lost in the <br/>
details.<br/>
