<div id="ygrps-yiv-140260778">HI Katie,  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve got a 4 1/2yo boy who i never have said he need to say these sorts of<br/>
things.   I don&#39; like to see moms and Dads saying in that singsongy voice,<br/>
&quot;What   to say now, say Thank you .  No we didn&#39;t do that w/ help please and<br/>
thank you,  He Just says it unbidden.  Mostly.  there are some time when he<br/>
might be quite taken by something that was given to him and merge with it.<br/>
What I d then is whisper in his hear that he might want to that that person<br/>
who gave it to him.  One time I suggested that if he needed to interrupt,<br/>
saying, excuse me was a good way to go. Now I hear him on the playground<br/>
saying excuse me, excuse me so much so that one of his cousins turned w/<br/>
disdain and told him he didn&#39;t have o say it TTHAT much  I think he could<br/>
use the word a bit more judiciously but that&#39;s him.<br/>
<br/>
As people have said, it&#39;s natural when it&#39;s modeled.<br/>
