<div id="ygrps-yiv-25934363">Hi Kelly,<br/>
<br/>
Your words below in the &quot;All or Nothing Topic&quot; were very helpful even though I wasn&#39;t the one asking. I&#39;ve actually never kept records because we&#39;re with a private school that doesn&#39;t require anything other than attendance. However, our oldest is 14 so I thought I&#39;d try to at least keep up a portfolio should he need one for anything.<br/>
<br/>
Do you (or anyone) have any recommendations of how I can make one based on the following? I want to focus on what he&#39;s &quot;doing&quot; rather than what &quot;should be&quot; done.<br/>
<br/>
- He&#39;s read tons of books on real estate and finances (no &quot;work&quot; to show for it though) from authors like George Carnegie, Robert T. Kiyosaki and Donald Trump.<br/>
<br/>
- He is avidly researching our family&#39;s ancestry<br/>
<br/>
- He has a virtual stock portfolio<br/>
<br/>
- He volunteers to help do work on the church of his best friend<br/>
<br/>
- He has been hired to do yard work for a friend<br/>
<br/>
- He volunteered at the library last summer<br/>
<br/>
- He plays video games<br/>
<br/>
- He&#39;s learned many things about the Navy <br/>
<br/>
- He occasionally does math books (that one is easy)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, do I need &quot;schooly&quot; language? If so, any advice on how to do that would be great. All I know is what report cards say and he really doesn&#39;t fit &quot;report card&quot; language in a lot of areas (science, no math grades, no grammar or language arts), that&#39;s why I&#39;m asking.<br/>
<br/>
This is for &quot;just in case&quot; he proceeds with his plans to dual enroll when he is 16. Also, in case he runs into problems with no matter what he chooses to do, I&#39;d like to find a certified, unschool friendly teacher and be able to show what he has done.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, through the books he&#39;s read, he&#39;s learned history but it isn&#39;t the same as the &quot;school&quot; kids. I think they do World, Ancient, European and American. <br/>
<br/>
Please forgive my ignorance on the subject and also my worrisome tone. My neighbor confronted me the other day about not making my kids test, not giving grades, and not using a curriculum--apparently she&#39;s spoken with &quot;numerous&quot; home schoolers and they&#39;ve never heard of &quot;your way of home schooling&quot;. She then used fear tactics by saying the FCAT (Florida standardized test) is hard and her 17 yo son couldn&#39;t even take adult high to finish out his senior year without passing it first so &quot;good luck getting your son in to college because they want grades and FCAT scores and a &quot;real diploma.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much ~ Sandy<br/>

            In SC, we *have* to keep records. So I jot down what we &quot;cover&quot; daily and keep tickets. brochures, flyers, etc. that we collect when we go out. I keep lists of library books, personal books, games, and projects. I have to write two progress reports each year. It&#39;s the law.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t keep track of what he *should* be learning/doing- --just what he actually learns/does. I think &quot;shoulds&quot; have no place in our homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If your state requires record-keeping, then by all means do it! As long as it doesn&#39;t interfere with your child&#39;s learning,... .<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If it keeps you busy and out of his way and if it helps you see the learning that is happening, then I think it can help you be at peace with unschooling. On the other hand, I think it can stand in the way of REAL learning if you&#39;re too busy trying to keep him at &quot;grade level&quot; or &quot;ahead.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1883489219">FCAT scores mean diddly to pretty much any college outside Florida (and<br/>
probably for many private colleges/universities inside FL also). Most<br/>
colleges accept parental issued diplomas for homeschoolers - a &#39;diploma&#39;<br/>
is simply a piece of paper indicating that a person has completed<br/>
something. And grades not so much important as SAT/ACT scores - and even<br/>
then many colleges are moving away from standardized tests to portfolios<br/>
or other means of seeing what this person has been doing for the last<br/>
several years.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than operating out of fear, go ahead and research a few colleges<br/>
and see what they actually require of homeschoolers. There are several<br/>
books out relating to preparing for college specifically for<br/>
homeschoolers. And there&#39;s a new yahoo group of teen/grown unschooled<br/>
young people who answer these sorts of questions from their perspective<br/>
- maybe track that down and ASK the young people who are preparing for<br/>
college, in college, done with college how they handled these issues.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-739106591">This is interesting,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to see the response because I know several individuals in this situation as well. I would think maybe a power point portfolio would be a good start. My 11 yr old wants to become a Vet but she LOVES Science so we do a lot of that. She is enrolled in an online course with Apologia Biology and she is the youngest in the class. I&#39;ve been researching College requirements for homeschoolers and I do see they want portfolio&#39;s but I also see that they want the kids to pass the SAT with extraordinary scores. I&#39;d say check out some schools and the requirements first.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Our way of homeschooling&quot; is definitely more effective than what they have going on in these institutions...lol<br/>
<br/>
I know..we did private, public and we&#39;ve been homeschooling for a little over a year. My daughter has accomplished more in the year than she ever has in school...and LOVES it!!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to find out more regarding the process as well:-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-281858042">Sandy, we are in Florida, too. I want to demonstrate from our personal experience here that there&#39;s absolutely no need for concern, whether your neighbors like it or not! :)<br/>
<br/>
Favorite Daughter now 18, suddenly decided at age 15 (the state law dual-enrollment minimum age) it would be fun to take some theatre and writing courses at Tallahassee Community College, and have access to their library.  She had no transcript or test scores (FCAT or SAT/ACT) and none was required -- she simply took the free computerized math and English placement test offered at the college, scored extremely high on the English portion and was approved on that basis to take whatever she wanted, except math.  <br/>
<br/>
When her two calendar years of free dual enrollment were up, we &quot;graduated&quot; her from home education (again without any sort of diploma or transcript) so she could be re-admitted to continue at TCC as a regular degree-seeking student, who by that time had been invited into the honors program. She then was forced to take basic math and discovered that she had a clinical math coding disorder, which was duly documented by the college disability office. Science courses were legally substituted and she aced them. <br/>
<br/>
The point of the story is that community college provides all the academic documentation needed good OR bad, without you as the unschooling parent giving a thought to any high schoolish curriculum or transcripts/testing. She just got accepted to FSU and in her chosen major (creative writing, very competitive at FSU) and will begin as a junior transfer in May, after graduating with her AA in April. Without taking the community college exit exam the CLAST either, btw!  Florida law guarantees general university acceptance to in-state AA transfers, although the student is not guaranteed automatic acceptance to any major, many of which are highly competitive and may involve auditions and/or additional prerequisites.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s now realistically excited about a Ph.D.in English despite her radically undocumented unschooling background and math disorder.  :) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-594061246">Wow, JJ...I don&#39;t think college determines ones success in life but you have really and truly eased my mind should my son go through with his long time talk of dual enrolling. <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve made my entire morning. It&#39;s nice to read real stories of people in &quot;your neck of the woods&quot; who are doing fine without documentation, testing and transcripts. And, you made me feel better about my neighbor&#39;s confrontation too. She was almost to the point of accusing me of being neglectful without actually saying it. Normally she is unobtrusive and we get along fine but it sounded like she was doing a side investigation on how we home educate.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much for taking time to write all of that out and a huge KUDOS to your daughter! :-) <br/>

Florida law guarantees general university acceptance to in-state AA transfers, although the student is not guaranteed automatic acceptance to any major, many of which are highly competitive and may involve auditions and/or additional prerequisites.<br/>

She&#39;s now realistically excited about a Ph.D.in English despite her radically undocumented unschooling background and math disorder.  :) <br/>

&gt; Hi Kelly,<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; Your words below in the &quot;All or Nothing Topic&quot; were very helpful even though I wasn&#39;t the one asking. I&#39;ve actually never kept records because we&#39;re with a private school that doesn&#39;t require anything other than attendance. However, our oldest is 14 so I thought I&#39;d try to at least keep up a portfolio should he need one for anything.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; Do you (or anyone) have any recommendations of how I can make one based on the following? I want to focus on what he&#39;s &quot;doing&quot; rather than what &quot;should be&quot; done.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip detail&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Please forgive my ignorance on the subject and also my worrisome tone. My neighbor confronted me the other day about not making my kids test, not giving grades, and not using a curriculum-- apparently she&#39;s spoken with &quot;numerous&quot; home schoolers and they&#39;ve never heard of &quot;your way of home schooling&quot;. She then used fear tactics by saying the FCAT (Florida standardized test) is hard and her 17 yo son couldn&#39;t even take adult high to finish out his senior year without passing it first so &quot;good luck getting your son in to college because they want grades and FCAT scores and a &quot;real diploma.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; Thanks so much ~ Sandy<br/>

I am not Kelly but &quot;Sage Momma&quot; that she is will definitely have an answer for you. I just wanted to make a comment about your neighbor. Don&#39;t let her get you into a panic. Her ignorance of your philosophy on life and learning should not get in the way of how you and your family are schooling your children. Your son will be fine. Just because this person has never heard of unschooling and it is so very different from the way these other homeschoolers she has supposedly spoken with approach learning in a more traditional method does not make your choice wrong nor are you endangering your son&#39;s chances of getting into college if he chooses to go that route. From the list of things you posted your son sounds like a &quot;well rounded&quot; individual (college speak for we want those types of students). <br/>
<br/>
When I sat in college lecture halls in 2001-2002 I had a fellow class mate who was 13 years younger than I was, she had been home schooled and started college at 15. She was accepted into the physician&#39;s assistant program at the school. Which is highly competitive and very intense. The last I heard she had graduated with honors and went on to become an excellent PA. She had never taken a test before college. She was also my calculus tutor. Thinking back that was probably the first time I had heard about unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
Stand fast and know that it sounds as if you have made the right choice for you and your family. <br/>
<br/>
As for a portfolio it sounds as if you have started one with your post. I have been keeping my own personal records of what the kids have been doing, I live in SC as well. I also love to hold on to my kids projects. I think my refrigerator is white, I can&#39;t remember it is covered with works of art, short stories, poems and photographs. They get moved into shoe boxes that have a label with the list of contents. Eventually I will scan and make  digital scrapbook of everything. We have a shoe box full of envelopes labeled with any tickets/receipts from places we have gone to. <br/>

Many colleges now have a spot on their application for home schoolers to check off and have adjusted their application process to make it easier for home schoolers to comply with their requests.  :)<br/>

FCAT scores mean diddly to pretty much any college outside Florida (and<br/>
probably for many private colleges/universities inside FL also). Most<br/>
colleges accept parental issued diplomas for homeschoolers - a &#39;diploma&#39;<br/>
is simply a piece of paper indicating that a person has completed<br/>
something. And grades not so much important as SAT/ACT scores - and even<br/>
then many colleges are moving away from standardized tests to portfolios<br/>
or other means of seeing what this person has been doing for the last<br/>
several years.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than operating out of fear, go ahead and research a few colleges<br/>
and see what they actually require of homeschoolers. There are several<br/>
books out relating to preparing for college specifically for<br/>
homeschoolers. And there&#39;s a new yahoo group of teen/grown unschooled<br/>
young people who answer these sorts of questions from their perspective<br/>
- maybe track that down and ASK the young people who are preparing for<br/>
college, in college, done with college how they handled these issues.<br/>

I know she directed those words toward you (or at least that is what she thought she was doing).  She just may be scared herself about HER son, though.  I can only imagine how anxiety producing it is for her knowing that her son may, after going through so much work, not be able to move on to the next thing/level.  She may be way more concerned about herself and her son than she is at all with you.  Your alternative ways cause her to reflect on how she is doing things and she understandably may feel that need to justify and/or defend her path.<br/>

I just told her that I was going to get her some volunteer experience lined up. We are in Georgia.<br/>
<br/>
She loves ALL animals but you made an excellent point. She is only 11 and taking her very first Biology course. It&#39;s High School level and she is in the top 10 of her class with a 95% so I am just watching her interest and will definitely encourage it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1206599559">FWIW I agree this rings true!  And the FCAT actually does ruin or at least threaten to ruin lives.  I helped our dance studio director get her artsy and smart son an (early) high school diploma from a Maine correspondence school after he got mucked up in school requirements like credit hours and the FCAT, when all he wanted to go dance professionally once he turned 18. The dad wouldn&#39;t hear of him not having &quot;a real diploma&quot; and Disney had a job waiting for him and, oh well, we can&#39;t all homeschool and very few get to unschool, but we CAN all make things a little less schooly for one kid at a time. . . :)<br/>
<br/>
So maybe you can express sympathy and concern for your neighbor, offer to share some ideas?  ;-)<br/>

<br/>
Here in California, none of the state colleges or universities would <br/>
accept a portfolio. Neither would the major private schools like USC or <br/>
Stanford. They want some combination of transcripts and essays and test <br/>
scores and letters of recommendation and lists of &quot;extracurricular&quot; <br/>
activities.<br/>

I&#39;ve really not heard of colleges wanting portfolios (with the exception <br/>
of art majors, of course).<br/>
