<div id="ygrps-yiv-1881666962">Well, all lists start somewhere, so here we are.:)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for helping me make a home for beginning unschoolers, where <br/>
questions can be answered without a full blown dissection of how <br/>
each person posts.<br/>
<br/>
My goal is to focus on unschooling, what unschooling days look like, <br/>
how unschooling affects all parts of our lives and exactly what the <br/>
philosophy IS. Natural learning is a fantastic journey, and I think <br/>
it&#39;s highly beneficial for people new to the idea,to be able to pick <br/>
the brains of those that have lived the lifestyle for many years.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome! I look forward to making this a useful and enlightening <br/>
list.<br/>
<br/>
