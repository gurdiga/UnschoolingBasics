<div id="ygrps-yiv-1880624249">Dear List,<br/>
<br/>
hmpf... sometimes it&#39;s hard to choose a &quot;subject&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I have a question: I assume that nobody here is concerned that their  <br/>
children, when older, might think that because their parents always  <br/>
helped them &quot;get what they want&quot;, they SHOULD always get what they  <br/>
want – also from non-parents (like, when they leave home or have a  <br/>
job or whatever). Why?<br/>
<br/>
It is not that I&#39;m fearing this – it&#39;s just that I don&#39;t know the  <br/>
answer. Many things in unschooling or tcs just feel &quot;right&quot; to me,  <br/>
but I can&#39;t really explain. It just hits my logic nerv, I &quot;know&quot; it&#39;s  <br/>
right but I&#39;m still curious what you say.<br/>
<br/>
And then I have another question – is there a difference between  <br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; and &quot;tcs&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Greetings<br/>
Johanna</div>

I have a question: I assume that nobody here is concerned that their<br/>
children, when older, might think that because their parents always<br/>

want – also from non-parents (like, when they leave home or have a<br/>
job or whatever). Why?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=--=<br/>
<br/>
I figure mine *will* always get what they want. What&#39;s the opposite of <br/>
that? *Never* getting what you want? Getting *nothing* you want? YUCK!<br/>
<br/>
By modelling how I get what I want and by brainstorming ways that my <br/>
boys get what they want/need, I think they&#39;ll be able to make their own <br/>
ways.<br/>
<br/>
I think we *should* all get what we need---and all work to get what we <br/>
want. My boys see me do both of those things ---for me, for their dad, <br/>
and for them. They don&#39;t see things magically appear---nor do they <br/>
expect that (after a certain age, I should probably say! &lt;g&gt;) because <br/>
they see the effort we put into their/our wants & needs. They <br/>
see/experience natural limitations (car died, need to put off <br/>
something---what?--and how to reorganize to get that thing back in the <br/>
queue?) and natural consequences.<br/>
<br/>
If one is not getting what he wants/needs at a job (or in life), he <br/>
probably needs to look for a new job that gives him what he needs OR <br/>
reorganize to see where he *can* get that thing or where he make <br/>
changes to fit it in. THAT&#39;s what we&#39;re modelling. *HOW* to get what we <br/>
want.<br/>
<br/>
An example:<br/>
<br/>
I know that *I* can get what I want. It may not be right away---or it <br/>
might. I *really* want to move to the mountains of VA---have a little <br/>
farm, be more secluded. Cameron&#39;s ready to move with me! &lt;g&gt; But <br/>
Duncan, at ten, still needs to be here. Ben&#39;s current job came with a <br/>
five year commitment---possibly eight years! His job is too sweet right <br/>
now to leave it. It&#39;s allowing us to do many other things (NOT make the <br/>
move right now though!). We *could* go ahead and buy the land, but that <br/>
would put several brakes on here. So I&#39;m giving up my *immediate* dream <br/>
for a while so that we can fulfill others here. I&#39;m OK with that. I <br/>
think the boys would all jump at giving me my farm if I really needed <br/>
to put that dream first. I know they would. But there are so many other <br/>
things that we, as a family, find more important, so I&#39;m putting mine <br/>
off. I&#39;ll get my farm, just a little later.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m making do and fulfilling parts of the dream by gardening and <br/>
keeping bees and researching and eventually getting chickens---small <br/>
steps. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They see each of us give a little to make it work for all of us. They <br/>
also see that the more we give, the more we get in other ways.<br/>
<br/>
I *want* my boys to always get what they want. Me too! Sometimes we <br/>
just need to devise creative ways to get there! And sometimes we need <br/>
help. By helping my boys now, I hope they&#39;ll help themselves, help <br/>
others, and even help me! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

  We have raised lots of chickens, turkeys, ducks, and guinea&#39;s...our neighbors have peafowl, too, which is why I don&#39;t. <br/>
   <br/>
  The all time favorites here are Silkies, Millie Fleurs, and  Araucanas, Ameraucanas the Easter Egg Chickens as they lay pastel colored eggs.  Rhode Island Reds for brown eggs.   When my kids were little, I&#39;d use the bantum eggs for toddler sized deviled eggs!  <br/>
   <br/>
  I used to sell the eggs and got twice as much for the blue/green ones then the brown ones.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-413087226">Hello Johanna, <br/>
<br/>
Why does &quot;getting what you want&quot; get a bad rap? Don&#39;t you want your <br/>
children to get what they want out of their lives? I know I do. <br/>
<br/>
My 11 year old daughter wants a horse. She knows how to ride, and <br/>
how to take care of them but right now, we don&#39;t have to property or <br/>
the money to spend on one. I have NO DOUBT that she will have a <br/>
horse one day. She talks about how when she buys her first home, she <br/>
wants enough room for two horses, a mare and her colt. Until then, <br/>
she rides when she can and loves to visit the horse farms near where <br/>
we live. There are a lot of opportunities here for horse lovers and <br/>
I do all I can to help her with that passion. <br/>
<br/>
What about you? Don&#39;t you want to get what you want out of your <br/>
life? We only get one shot at this life. I don&#39;t want to look back <br/>
at the end of mine and see a list of things I wanted but never <br/>
reached for.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a quote I like...simple and to the point:<br/>
Deepak Chopra: &quot;Life is a field of unlimited possibilities&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
You sound like me a couple years ago.  :-)  Then I went to the unschooling<br/>
conference in Peabody, MA and participated in a workshop put on by Barbara<br/>
Sher, author of Wishcraft.  In the workshop we had to state what our dreams<br/>
were and what stood between ourselves and our dreams and the other people in<br/>
the workshop helped brainstorm with us as to how we could make those dreams<br/>
come true.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
What it made me face was that yes, money was partly the issue, but a bigger<br/>
part was the fear of the unknown for me.  I came home excited about the idea<br/>
of making that dream come true.  I let people know what our dream was and in<br/>
a very short time I was able to make that dream come true.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We started out working for board at the stable where my kids took lessons.<br/>
The girls cut back on lessons in order to have their own horse.  Here we are<br/>
a short two years later and we now have two horses.   This spring we had a<br/>
small barn and arena built and brought our horses home.  We are living our<br/>
dream and it wasn�t as hard to make it come true as you would think.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My husband and I are still driving our paid off vehicles, at least for now.<br/>
(there�s a truck and trailer in our dream too)  We have a bit more debt than<br/>
we previously did.  But kids aren�t kids forever and its nice to be able to<br/>
make their childhood dreams come true while we still can. <br/>

<br/>
Yes, I&#39;m familiar with Barbara Sher and have read Wishcraft. :-) I <br/>
highly recommend it. <br/>
<br/>
If anyone is interested, here are some links to get you started:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.wishcraft.com/">http://www.wishcraft.com/</a><br/>

<br/>
My daughter is living her dream and reaching for her goal with our, <br/>
and other&#39;s help. It&#39;s amazing what comes into your life by putting <br/>
it out there. :-) <br/>
<br/>
Some examples....<br/>
In the short time that she&#39;s been interested in horses, we&#39;ve met <br/>
another homeschooling mother who was looking for an apprentice of <br/>
sorts. Shawna goes to her house once a week and helps her care for <br/>
her three horses. She cleans the stalls, feeds them, grooms them and <br/>
learns how to ride and jump.  <br/>
<br/>
This friend has taken Shawna to a seminar with Pat Parelli, who she <br/>
met and spoke to afterwards. He and his wife gave Shawna copied of <br/>
their dvd&#39;s and have e-mailed her to see how she is. This same <br/>
friend also took her to a horse sale and they watched race horses <br/>
being auctioned. Being at these two places gave Shawna the chance to <br/>
meet a lot of prominent &quot;horse people&quot; in our city. We live in <br/>
Ocala, Florida which is the &quot;Horse Capitol of the World&quot; and there <br/>
is no shortage of opportunites for horses to be part of her life <br/>
here. She&#39;s met and made friends with jockeys, professional riders <br/>
and trainers. She&#39;s well liked within the horse community here and <br/>
not being in school has enabled her to pursue opportunites she may <br/>
not have been able to. Horses are a big part of her life and she&#39;s <br/>
put herself out there and made a lot happen in a short time. I have <br/>
no doubt that she&#39;ll own a horse one day...probably several. :-) <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;but a bigger part was the fear of the unknown for me.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s great that you realised that. :-) Some people go through <br/>
their whole life and never do. <br/>
My life wouldn&#39;t be what it is today if I had let fear stop me. I <br/>
would never have been able to move from the only home I knew in <br/>
New York City after living through September 11. I wouldn&#39;t have <br/>
been able to adopt three children through foster care if fear was a <br/>
factor. Fear could have easily stopped me from doing those life <br/>
changing things. <br/>
<br/>
But they didn&#39;t. :-) And my life is better for it. <br/>
<br/>

I have  a question: I assume that nobody here is concerned that their <br/>
children,  when older, might think that because their parents always <br/>
helped them &quot;get  what they want&quot;, they SHOULD always get what they <br/>
want – also from  non-parents (like, when they leave home or have a <br/>
job or whatever).  Why?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Who said that.  LOL  I do expect that I will get what I  want.  And I am <br/>
willing to work to get there.  I think everyone should  get what they want.  I <br/>
also think it is important to remember that we are  all human (at least most of <br/>
us,,,LOL)  so we can change our minds about  what we want.   We have the <br/>
ability to make choices.  Sometimes  we are willing to do something we don&#39;t <br/>
necessarily want, to get what we want in  the end.  Like a job.  Although if I really <br/>
didn&#39;t like a job I  wouldn&#39;t stay.  But if the end result of the job (money <br/>
maybe) was what I  wanted, I would be willing (to some extent) to do something <br/>
I might not  necessarily want to get there.  Or maybe not.  Maybe my need to <br/>
be  doing something I totally enjoy would take precedence over the need for <br/>
money  from this job.  Many solutions.<br/>
 <br/>
In our house we live consensually.  Which means  that we all get what we <br/>
want.  We work really hard at it.  To make  sure everyone&#39;s needs and wants are <br/>
met.  When the boys have friends over  and there are 4 or 5 kids here we work <br/>
even harder, but the goal is the same,  that everyone&#39;s wants and needs are met <br/>
with mutually agreeable solutions.   My boys have been living this way and <br/>
seeing it work so they know there is  always a solution if they are willing to <br/>
work for it.  Seeing it and living  it they are able to take their experience <br/>
out into the world.  So I see  them working out solutions consensually with <br/>
friends on the playground  etc.  I believe that as they grow they will carry it <br/>
with them as a  valuable tool.  <br/>
 <br/>
OK I am busy with other stuff so only have a  minute.  <br/>
 <br/>
Take care,<br/>

there is of course nothing bad about &quot;getting what you want&quot; – it&#39;s  <br/>
just bad if you don&#39;t get it after all. I guess I wonder if these  <br/>

just don&#39;t get what they want.<br/>
<br/>
There are no guarantees you will always get what you want.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve wanted soooo much to sing and be somehow successful with it. I  <br/>
don&#39;t even want much – I don&#39;t want a contract with Sony or be  <br/>
&quot;famous&quot; etc – just a local small fangroup and the ability to  <br/>
complete an album, even if not published, or just sing in front of  <br/>
people and of course not being &quot;booed&quot; after my performance. I sing  <br/>
well, too! That&#39;s my passion and that&#39;s what I always wanted. Sure,  <br/>
my parents weren&#39;t supportive at all, but I managed to go cleaning up  <br/>
at other people&#39;s homes for money while I had a little daughter of 3  <br/>
and was studying at the same time and living on my own without the  <br/>
help of my parents, just to be able to pay for singing lessons. The  <br/>
thing is, I still don&#39;t have any success (on my terms) with it and I  <br/>
feel like I will never have. I&#39;m getting older (that&#39;s not the point  <br/>
though), I have children who demand a great deal of time in my life,  <br/>
I have to work for living and there is just no time left to do  <br/>
anything like that except for a few hours a month at most. For doing  <br/>
music, like professionally or even semi-pro., you have to kind of  <br/>
&quot;work&quot; on it as much as you&#39;d be willing to work for a &quot;real&quot; job, if  <br/>
you really want to succeed. And then there is this big ammount of  <br/>
millions of people who want the same, there is always someone who is  <br/>
more skilled than I am (in singing, or in getting to know the &quot;right&quot;  <br/>
people, in advertising himself, in arranging, in composing etc...)<br/>
<br/>
I used to think &quot;if you only *want* something enough, you&#39;ll get it&quot;,  <br/>
you just have to work hard, be creative, find ways etc etc. But this  <br/>
is quite like the &quot;American Dream&quot; – if you really want it, you WILL  <br/>
get it, it promises, but if you don&#39;t and stay poor, and don&#39;t  <br/>
succeed to always get a greater job and get  more money – it means  <br/>
you are lazy &quot;then you just didn&#39;t work hard enough&quot;. This is just  <br/>
not the case, because not all people have equal opportunities! And  <br/>
though what I used to think had nothing to do with the American Dream  <br/>
in the sense of growing rich out of nothing, it still implies that if  <br/>
you don&#39;t succeed in what you &quot;wanted&quot; – then you probably didn&#39;t  <br/>
want it enough, or you didn&#39;t try hard enough or you are just lazy or  <br/>
dumb or whatever. And thinking that &quot;if you only want somehting  <br/>
enough..&quot; made me confident I *would* get it – but I don&#39;t see it  <br/>
happening at all, and this is since 10, 15 years now. So the  <br/>
disappointment of not getting what I wanted has caused many tears  <br/>
over the past 5 years because my goal seems farther and farther away.  <br/>
So unschooled children, won&#39;t they always be very confident they  <br/>
&quot;will&quot; get what they want and then be also as disappointed as I am  <br/>
about not getting it? I&#39;m learning to deal with it though but it has  <br/>
taken years of crying each month for not being completely happy :-(<br/>
<br/>
Of course, unschooled children are given all the possibilities and  <br/>
always taken serious about what they want and so on – but it just may  <br/>
be that some of their wishes cannot become true (?) and then they  <br/>
might not be able to deal with that disappointment (?) I guess that&#39;s  <br/>
what people mean when they say that they won&#39;t be able to &quot;deal with  <br/>

   <br/>
  I just have to ask....did your parents help you to get pregnant?  And why were you on your own?<br/>
   <br/>
  I just have an issue of blaming the parents.  If you give kids free choice, and they chose poorly, is it the parents fault?  I give my kids &quot;free choice&quot;.  I show them different paths towards their goals.  If they chose to go a different way, should I feel guilty?  Pick up their responsibility?  I have two teenager girls that I have talked extensively to.  I highly recommend they pursue higher education. Strive for their dreams.  But am I to continue to feed and house them if they chose to not pursue a life in their adulthood?  My oldest plans to continue her education in Europe.<br/>
  I have pulled tons of information for her on how she can accomplish this.<br/>
   <br/>
  If she chooses not to follow through nor do any research for herself, should I continue to carry her?  There comes a point that one makes choices for oneself.  <br/>
  I apologize if I&#39;ve offended anyone but I am not responsible for my sister&#39;s mistakes nor are my parents responsible for my choices.  My job is to teach my children how to learn and grow and make wise choices for bringing their dreams to reality.<br/>
   <br/>
  On this note.<br/>
  Have a nice night<br/>

get what they want.<br/>
<br/>
Though sometimes the process is just buying them whatever they&#39;re  <br/>
asking for (a book, a candy bar, a Matchbox car), often, especially  <br/>
as they get older, they want things that are more expensive things or  <br/>
more complex.<br/>
<br/>
If they want a picnic and it rains, they experience how to change  <br/>
plans. Have a picnic inside. Or do something different and have a  <br/>
picnic the next day.<br/>
<br/>
If they want an expensive something that isn&#39;t in the budget to buy,  <br/>
they experience creative ways the family can earn some extra cash.  <br/>
eBay! Yard sale. Pooper scoopers ....<br/>
<br/>
Rather than learning that the world owes them whatever they want,  <br/>
they experience as they grow up problem solving ways to get it.<br/>

<br/>
And that&#39;s the good thing about learning through living. You *don&#39;t*  <br/>
always get what you want and part of learning to go after your dreams  <br/>
is being flexible and perhaps going after something you *can* get  <br/>
that will work for now.<br/>
<br/>
If the choices are to pursue what you want or not pursue it, then  <br/>
pursuing it will work a lot better ;-)<br/>
<br/>
If the choices are to focus on the one and only goal or to be  <br/>
flexible and see the possibilities that move you closer or are  <br/>
enjoyable or are a little pausing places, then being flexible will  <br/>
work a lot better.<br/>
<br/>
I think focusing on what you enjoy rather than where you want to be  <br/>
is more likely to be successful. Focusing on what will lead you  <br/>
directly to a goal is like putting on blinders and seeing only  <br/>
directly ahead. It&#39;s like going to school to get into college and get  <br/>
a good job ;-) You miss out on a lot of opportunities that don&#39;t fall  <br/>
directly in front of you that *could* be helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Keeping a goal in mind is *very* helpful, but focusing on, say a  <br/>
recording, you&#39;ll be missing the fun opportunities that could -- as a  <br/>
side effect -- move you closer to what you enjoy. Singing with  <br/>
friends for fun would put you in contact with people who love singing  <br/>
as much as you do and who know people who love singing.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m explaining that well.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the journey that&#39;s important, not the destination.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-147928250">&lt;Some examples....<br/>
In the short time that she&#39;s been interested in horses, we&#39;ve met <br/>
another homeschooling mother who was looking for an apprentice of <br/>
sorts. Shawna goes to her house once a week and helps her care for <br/>
her three horses. She cleans the stalls, feeds them, grooms them and <br/>
learns how to ride and jump. &gt;<br/>
<br/>
Those are awesome examples of working toward what you want in a positive<br/>
way.  I see so many people looking at the road blocks that stand in their<br/>
way instead of looking at the opportunities they have to work toward a goal.<br/>
Getting what you want isn�t a bad thing as long as other people aren�t<br/>
getting hurt so you can get what you want.   I hope my kids follow my<br/>
example and work hard to get whatever it is that they do want.  I hope they<br/>
don�t let money or fear stand in their way.  I hope they share their dreams<br/>
with others so that other people can choose to help them or not.  If you<br/>
don�t put your dreams out there, people can�t begin to help you.<br/>

not undoable. A friend of ours writes music, plays guitar and sings. <br/>
He loves it. He sings at coffee shop open mike events (maybe once a <br/>

self-published) several CDs and people actually buy them - $5 apiece <br/>
(covers materials and time to duplicate them and such). It&#39;s all <br/>
doable with just a good mic and some good computer software to record <br/>

having a recording of your singing is important to you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-728039200">I wanted to respond to the person who felt they had lost what they <br/>
wanted , or were losing it ( singing).  I think that what you wanted <br/>
is a particular relationship, a way of being treated and seen, <br/>
known . I think it is important to explore this and not be confused <br/>
by a chosen  container , a concrete expression that you can hold on <br/>
to. I think what you want may be  available , but that there are <br/>
many wishes and motivations involved. I think being too stuck in the <br/>
concrete and not undrstanding your emotional expereince is a <br/>
mistake, keeping it concrete is a way to have or not, ( but not <br/>
really be engaged with being)it is a splitting, yes -no , good -bad, <br/>
this allows you to flip back and forth between two modes of being <br/>
and I beleive to be strangulated ways to experience the world. i <br/>
think both are very molded from past ways you have forged to deal <br/>
with pressures and emotional experiences  as best as you could in <br/>
the past. I think you can do better now, to try to delve more deeply <br/>
into your desires and wishes and try to understand what you wanted <br/>
and from whom, and to explore the relationships and past losses. I <br/>
feel what you describe as what you always wanted is something that <br/>
you weren&#39;t allowed to experience as a child and again I don&#39;t mean <br/>
this concretely but emotionally. I think what your expressing in <br/>
your sadness is an attempt a true wish to give up this past <br/>
insistance on getting ( entitlement) of what we all ideally do <br/>
deserve as children. I think your pondering attempting to let this <br/>
go and engage with what is present for you. I think this scares you <br/>
as you somewhat bleakly desribe your economic situation. I think <br/>
artistic  creative processes allow us to see and experience a <br/>
reality that is open, to continually allow a flow of new ideas and <br/>
emotional experiences that saturate our preconceptions but also <br/>
allow these new conceptions to become unsaturated anew. I think your <br/>
wish of singing is powerful and is a rich source of life and hope <br/>
and faith, but that your idea of seeing this as successful is not so <br/>
healthy, is annonymous approval and about getting what you didn&#39;t <br/>
before, I think that singing is a very good venue to explore your <br/>
emotions and understanding of your experience , I also think that <br/>
the community or fan base you really need is one of like minded <br/>
musicians who explore art for its wisdom beauty and grace and not <br/>
for its vaidation in a commodity based society that is estranged <br/>
from trying to get what it wants but settles for a dull drone . <br/>
sorry for the rambling nature and this is meant as an expression of <br/>
experiences I have had and trying to project them upon your <br/>
situation. I know I know you not and don&#39;t suppose I&#39;m correct but i <br/>
offer it as an interpretatiion to think of and discard what seems <br/>
ludicrous<br/>

of mine for so very long and it just gets worse. I don&#39;t feel like  <br/>
I&#39;ve not tried enough or that I expected one way and so was blind to  <br/>
others. I am in the lucky position that the man I make music with (or  <br/>
want to), is IN THE HOUSE! We live together, he is the father of my  <br/>
son and the man I love. We&#39;ve worked hard to get the best software  <br/>
available (we make electronic music, I sing to it), but it seems  <br/>
there is just no time left – and this even though my daughter is at  <br/>
school, and we should have &quot;time&quot;, but we just don&#39;t have – and I  <br/>
DON&#39;T use all my time cleaning up, it&#39;s rather chaotic in the  <br/>
house... We have only small amounts of time in which nothing really  <br/>
can be done, besides writing e-mails or reading a bit – and now with  <br/>
unschooling it is less time even :-) You know, these 5 Minutes in  <br/>
between or 10 or maybe 30 sometimes before the next &quot;Mama!&quot; comes...  <br/>
and by the end of the day, when there would finally be like 1-2 hours  <br/>
I&#39;m so exhausted I have no muse to make music or sing or compose.  <br/>
Since we are unschooling there is even less time and by the time we  <br/>
will be able to fully unschool, take her off from school I&#39;ll even  <br/>
have less time, so I really don&#39;t see it happen at all. The one thing  <br/>
I did though is that I&#39;m teaching Spanish through songs, each lesson  <br/>
is based on a spanish song, and I bring my guitar and we sing, it is  <br/>
much fun. But it is not my dream and it is not as satisfying. I&#39;m  <br/>
always trying to write it off because it is so difficult to deal with  <br/>
the fact that it just won&#39;t happen.<br/>
<br/>
How do you ever get things done for yourself? Maybe it&#39;s easier for  <br/>
you when you do things that don&#39;t require really quiet moments. For  <br/>
recording, good recording, it needs to be really quiet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1782361472">&quot;So unschooled children, won&#39;t they always be very confident they  <br/>
&quot;will&quot; get what they want and then be also as disappointed as I am  <br/>
about not getting it? I&#39;m learning to deal with it though but it has  <br/>
taken years of crying each month for not being completely happy :-(&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Wow...I have SO much to say on this topic,but I&#39;ll try to be brief. If<br/>
singing is what truly brings you joy, then you can access that joy<br/>
anytimes you wish. It sounds like you have this very exact, concrete<br/>
version of what &quot;success&quot; looks like in your life and anything less is<br/>
a &quot;failure&quot;. Not a great way to approach your passions.<br/>
<br/>
Let GO of your version of anything. Get out of that tiny little box<br/>
you&#39;ve put your dreams into and start approaching what you love with<br/>
abandon! Do it because it makes you happy. Sing because you have a<br/>
beautiful voice and create opportunities to follow your passion within<br/>
the live you CHOSE for yourself. You chose exactly where you are<br/>
today. You chose the children, the lifestyle...all of it. And if you<br/>
can begin to see it all as a choice to be enjoyed, then what is there<br/>
to cry about?<br/>
<br/>
Having a very concrete version of &quot;success&quot; will limit you. Maybe the<br/>
universe has a better idea of how that voice will enrich your life and<br/>
the world!! Pursuing your passion is part of it, but trusting the flow<br/>
of life is another big part. That doesn&#39;t make us passive<br/>
participants, but it does open a person up for change/flow and the<br/>
ability to ADAPT.<br/>
<br/>
I think unschooled kids, while perfectly able to acheive their dreams<br/>
and goals, will be much less rigid than schooled minds. They KNOW that<br/>
life throws curveballs at us. They are creative thinkers!! Having a<br/>
defined version of success is not even part of my children&#39;s lives!<br/>
Not mine either.<br/>
<br/>
We do what we love, we go where that leads. If one thing doesn&#39;t work<br/>
out the way we planned, we can go in a new direction. It&#39;s all good!<br/>
<br/>
As far as singing, there are so many independent artists that record<br/>
their own CD&#39;s. Have you ever done that? Maybe just having your own CD<br/>
could be a life goal regardless of whether ANYONE buys it! Maybe<br/>
singing for weddings or local shows occasionally would be fun? Maybe<br/>
giving singing lessons would be a part-time way to keep in touch with<br/>
what you love while still being available for your children.<br/>
<br/>
You sound very &quot;stuck&quot; in your ideas and passions. Loosen up. Crying<br/>
about what you don&#39;t have isn&#39;t going to help you find your joy. You<br/>
have your voice, you&#39;re alive, you could live to be 100 and how are<br/>
you going to spend the rest of your time here? Make it GREAT.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1603532248">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t quite understand what you are saying.<br/>
<br/>
I simply said that I didn&#39;t have any help from my parents – neither  <br/>
to just &quot;live&quot; (financial support or something) nor to pursue my  <br/>
dreams. Actually, they had a lot of money at the time and I wanted to  <br/>
study music. To study music, I had to, by the curriculum of the  <br/>
university, perform a piece on a piano. I asked piano teachers if it  <br/>
would be possible to learn a piece good enough in half a year as to  <br/>
perform and get accepted. It was possible and many people do it this  <br/>
way, they said. I asked my parents for piano lessons at the time but  <br/>
they said it wasn&#39;t the right choice for me and it was stupid to  <br/>
think I could pursue a musical career because &quot;all good musicians  <br/>
start at 3 years old&quot; or something like that. They didn&#39;t believe in  <br/>
me and still don&#39;t do (ever since I&#39;m nervous when I am to sing in  <br/>
front of them (Christmas etc.), a vicious cycle: I know I will be  <br/>
nervous and being nervous my voice won&#39;t be as good and then again I  <br/>
will not be able to &quot;prove it&quot; and then I get more nervous and of  <br/>
course I sing badly....) and well, I couldn&#39;t do it at the time.<br/>
<br/>
When I then, by an &quot;accident&quot; a don&#39;t regret :-) got pregnant (and  <br/>
no, they didn&#39;t help me ;-) (but what does it matter? I don&#39;t get it,  <br/>
please explain)) and had a household of my own, it took 2 years or so  <br/>
until I could, next to my studies at university, go cleaning up for  <br/>
lack of a better job at the time - to have some extra money next to  <br/>
what the state could afford on me - to pay singing lessons.<br/>
<br/>
I was on my own, because I chose to – I was 21 when I got pregnant  <br/>
and I was able to manage and am since!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t quite understand your issue with blaming the parents. Of  <br/>
course, if you as a parent GIVE free choice, then nobody can blame  <br/>
you. If the parents DON&#39;T GIVE free choice and are rather your  <br/>
enemies, putting stones in your way, how could I not blame them?<br/>
<br/>
And anyway, I wasn&#39;t blaming them – I was just trying to explain the  <br/>
situation I was it, and show how badly I wanted to sing, that I even  <br/>
did a shitty job I hated for it, and this in the context of &quot;bad  <br/>
times&quot; cause I wasn&#39;t financially supported by my parents.<br/>
<br/>
My mother also says she&#39;s not responsible for my feelings. So if she  <br/>
ever treats me bad, and I feel bad – it&#39;s not her fault, since it&#39;s  <br/>
&quot;up to me&quot; if I feel bad!! Good logic! This way you are never guilty  <br/>
and never wrong with what you do, then you never have to change  <br/>
anything even if you hurt other people! And I&#39;m never allowed to  <br/>
blame her? Hm, maybe you could explain, because I don&#39;t really  <br/>
understand, or I&#39;m thinking really wrong :-) I&#39;m up to be convinced!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I just have an issue of blaming the parents. If you give kids free  <br/>

&gt; Pick up their responsibility? I have two teenager girls that I have  <br/>
&gt; talked extensively to. I highly recommend they pursue higher  <br/>
&gt; education. Strive for their dreams. But am I to continue to feed  <br/>
&gt; and house them if they chose to not pursue a life in their  <br/>
&gt; adulthood? My oldest plans to continue her education in Europe.<br/>
&gt; I have pulled tons of information for her on how she can accomplish  <br/>
&gt; this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If she chooses not to follow through nor do any research for  <br/>
&gt; herself, should I continue to carry her? There comes a point that  <br/>
&gt; one makes choices for oneself.<br/>
&gt; I apologize if I&#39;ve offended anyone but I am not responsible for my  <br/>

&gt; &gt; Why does &quot;getting what you want&quot; get a bad rap? Don&#39;t you want your<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; What about you? Don&#39;t you want to get what you want out of your<br/>

&gt; &gt; at the end of mine and see a list of things I wanted but never<br/>
&gt; &gt; reached for.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hello Joanne,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; there is of course nothing bad about &quot;getting what you want&quot; – it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; just bad if you don&#39;t get it after all. I guess I wonder if these<br/>
&gt; kids can deal with it better or worse than mainstream people, if they<br/>
&gt; just don&#39;t get what they want.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are no guarantees you will always get what you want.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve wanted soooo much to sing and be somehow successful with it. I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t even want much – I don&#39;t want a contract with Sony or be<br/>
&gt; &quot;famous&quot; etc – just a local small fangroup and the ability to<br/>
&gt; complete an album, even if not published, or just sing in front of<br/>
&gt; people and of course not being &quot;booed&quot; after my performance. I sing<br/>
&gt; well, too! That&#39;s my passion and that&#39;s what I always wanted. Sure,<br/>
&gt; my parents weren&#39;t supportive at all, but I managed to go cleaning up<br/>
&gt; at other people&#39;s homes for money while I had a little daughter of 3<br/>
&gt; and was studying at the same time and living on my own without the<br/>
&gt; help of my parents, just to be able to pay for singing lessons. The<br/>
&gt; thing is, I still don&#39;t have any success (on my terms) with it and I<br/>
&gt; feel like I will never have. I&#39;m getting older (that&#39;s not the point<br/>
&gt; though), I have children who demand a great deal of time in my life,<br/>
&gt; I have to work for living and there is just no time left to do<br/>
&gt; anything like that except for a few hours a month at most. For doing<br/>
&gt; music, like professionally or even semi-pro., you have to kind of<br/>
&gt; &quot;work&quot; on it as much as you&#39;d be willing to work for a &quot;real&quot; job, if<br/>
&gt; you really want to succeed. And then there is this big ammount of<br/>
&gt; millions of people who want the same, there is always someone who is<br/>
&gt; more skilled than I am (in singing, or in getting to know the &quot;right&quot;<br/>
&gt; people, in advertising himself, in arranging, in composing etc...)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I used to think &quot;if you only *want* something enough, you&#39;ll get it&quot;,<br/>
&gt; you just have to work hard, be creative, find ways etc etc. But this<br/>
&gt; is quite like the &quot;American Dream&quot; – if you really want it, you WILL<br/>
&gt; get it, it promises, but if you don&#39;t and stay poor, and don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; succeed to always get a greater job and get more money – it means<br/>
&gt; you are lazy &quot;then you just didn&#39;t work hard enough&quot;. This is just<br/>
&gt; not the case, because not all people have equal opportunities! And<br/>
&gt; though what I used to think had nothing to do with the American Dream<br/>
&gt; in the sense of growing rich out of nothing, it still implies that if<br/>
&gt; you don&#39;t succeed in what you &quot;wanted&quot; – then you probably didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; want it enough, or you didn&#39;t try hard enough or you are just lazy or<br/>
&gt; dumb or whatever. And thinking that &quot;if you only want somehting<br/>
&gt; enough..&quot; made me confident I *would* get it – but I don&#39;t see it<br/>
&gt; happening at all, and this is since 10, 15 years now. So the<br/>
&gt; disappointment of not getting what I wanted has caused many tears<br/>
&gt; over the past 5 years because my goal seems farther and farther away.<br/>
&gt; So unschooled children, won&#39;t they always be very confident they<br/>
&gt; &quot;will&quot; get what they want and then be also as disappointed as I am<br/>
&gt; about not getting it? I&#39;m learning to deal with it though but it has<br/>
&gt; taken years of crying each month for not being completely happy :-(<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Of course, unschooled children are given all the possibilities and<br/>
&gt; always taken serious about what they want and so on – but it just may<br/>
&gt; be that some of their wishes cannot become true (?) and then they<br/>
&gt; might not be able to deal with that disappointment (?) I guess that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; what people mean when they say that they won&#39;t be able to &quot;deal with<br/>
&gt; the real world&quot; (although I find that unschooled kids are far more in<br/>
&gt; the &quot;real world&quot; than school kids but...)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1690038016">&quot;And I&#39;m never allowed to<br/>
blame her? &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Depends.<br/>
YES, I think you have a right to be angry at their lack of support. I<br/>
think anger is the first step to healing. I think you have every right<br/>
to examine what they did wrong, turn it over and look at every angle<br/>
and in every light. I think seeing clearly where they didn&#39;t help you,<br/>
will actually be a very important piece in letting it go.<br/>
<br/>
So blame them for their actions or lack of actions. BUT, don&#39;t blame<br/>
them as an excuse for what you are or are not today.  Because now it&#39;s<br/>
up to you. You have a choice to be bigger and better than their<br/>
limitations. You have a right to everything your heart desires. You<br/>
are worthy and beautiful and talented. Their limited and limiting view<br/>
of YOU is NOT what you are about!! That&#39;s it. Simple right? But<br/>
disentangling ourselves from our parents view of us is sometimes more<br/>
complicated than all that.  That&#39;s why I believe it is SO important<br/>
for us to be that clear/calm pool, so that we reflect the TRUTH of our<br/>
children back to themselves, rather than some distorted view that is<br/>
filtered through fears and judgement.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a process. One that you can live in each moment. When you hear<br/>
that voice saying &quot;I&#39;m not good enough&quot; you can LAUGH in it&#39;s face and<br/>
say &quot;that isn&#39;t ME!! I AM good, I AM talented, I AM successful&quot;<br/>
YOUR voice wouldn&#39;t put you down, would it? So that must be someone<br/>
elses voice getting inside your head and it has no right to be there<br/>
any longer.:)<br/>
<br/>
Replace all those voices with positive self-talk. Practice<br/>
self-kindness and compassion. Give yourself and your children all that<br/>
positive talk that your parents could not give you. Recognize that it<br/>
wasn&#39;t about YOU at all...it was their own lack and self-perception<br/>
that allowed them to rob you of fullness. It was about THEM, not YOU.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you already know this logically. But I think emotionally you&#39;re<br/>
hanging onto some of the fears they dumped on you. They had no right<br/>
to do it, but they truly didn&#39;t know better. So let it go. Let<br/>
yourself be the fullest expression of YOU. You are not defined by<br/>
anyone elses expectations or ideas. Go ahead.....be larger than life!!<br/>
It&#39;s ok to be grand and beautiful and amazing. It&#39;s ok to be in the<br/>
spotlight. It&#39;s ok to be the master and captain of your ship....don&#39;t<br/>
let anyone tell you differently.:) It&#39;s also ok to surround yourself<br/>
with people that buy into your dreams and limit people that aren&#39;t<br/>
going to support it. Create the world you NEED to nourish yourself and<br/>
your BIG dreams. Then simply live the passion each day, without any<br/>
limiting ideas of what those dreams look like. Just BE a singer.<br/>
Because you are.<br/>

&gt; Oh gosh, don&#39;t sing because someone expects you to.  Sing because you<br/>
&gt; WANT to!  You don&#39;t have to PROVE anything to your parents.  YOu don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have to prove anything to anyone.  If you are going to sing, dance,<br/>
&gt; create, paint, draw, weave, spin, knit, cook, grow a garden, ride a<br/>
&gt; unicycle, WHATEVER do it because you WANT to not because you feel you have to prove that you can.  If music is a dream of yours, then pursue it.  Take a class here or there.  Find a voice or piano teacher who teachers &quot;children of all ages&quot; or that specializes in teaching adults.  You don&#39;t have to go to the big concert halls to prove that you are good enough.  You do these things because you enjoy them.  I think it was Harrison Ford who said something like, &quot;If I didn&#39;t love acting I wouldn&#39;t do it.  I don&#39;t ever want to do something that I don&#39;t love and I don&#39;t want to do something that I loathe.  I act because I enjoy it, not to prove anything to anyone, but just because I love creating my craft.&quot;  (that is major paraphrased and it may have been another actor - but I do remember I saw it on Inside the Actor&#39;s Studio).<br/>
<br/>
I was a theatre arts major with minor studies in vocal music.  I was<br/>
not supported by my parents in this dream at all.  They wanted me to<br/>
be a doctor or a nurse or a lawyer or a teacher.  Something<br/>
*practical*!  I paid for all 5 years of college with very little<br/>
assistance from my parents.  I did it because I loved what I was<br/>
doing.  I loved creating, acting, singing, dancing, making people<br/>
laugh, cry, giggle, and blush.  I think now how much easier it would<br/>
have been had my parents actually supported at least my dreams.  Even<br/>
if they never gave me a penny of financial support, if they had just<br/>
believed in me and been proud of what I did.  THAT is what our<br/>
children need most from us.  That belief in their dreams and helping<br/>
them to pursue them.<br/>
<br/>
Sing because you want to sing.<br/>

So unschooled children, won&#39;t they always be very confident they<br/>
&quot;will&quot; get what they want and then be also as disappointed as I am<br/>
about not getting it? I&#39;m learning to deal with it though but it has<br/>
taken years of crying each month for not being completely happy :-(<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I HOPE my chidren will always be confident that they will get what they <br/>
want. With the power to know *what* they want, they&#39;ll be able to deal <br/>
with temporary disappointments and set-backs. Thinking that they <br/>
weren&#39;t good *enough* or worthy *enough* could make them simply <br/>
quit---or not even bother to try. I&#39;d much rather know that *they* know <br/>
that they are capable.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
There are no guarantees you will always get what you want.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
No, but it IS guaranteed that, f you DON&#39;T go after it at all, you <br/>
won&#39;t attain *anything*!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my passion and that&#39;s what I always wanted. Sure,<br/>
my parents weren&#39;t supportive at all,<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Sorry---you don&#39;t seem passionate *enough* to me.<br/>
<br/>
Oh! And how is that &quot;unsupportive parent thing&quot; working out for *you*? <br/>
Do you want the same thing for your daughter? What would you do <br/>
differently for your daughter? Or do you think that being just as <br/>
unsupportive would give her an edge---or would it make her strive less <br/>
for those things that are important to her---I mean, you don&#39;t want her <br/>
to think she can have anything she wants, right?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  For doing music, like professionally or even semi-pro., you have to <br/>
kind of<br/>
&quot;work&quot; on it as much as you&#39;d be willing to work for a &quot;real&quot; job, if<br/>
you really want to succeed.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
My son, at 18, is a professional musician. Yes, he puts *many* hours in <br/>
each day to improve/learn new licks, etc. It IS his &quot;real&quot; job. He <br/>
*chooses* to make that his priority. He&#39;s backed off on the time he <br/>
spends watching TV, reading, talking with his girlfriend, and even <br/>
being on the COMPUTER!!!  Because music IS his priority. But that&#39;s <br/>
true of anyone who is looking to make a career of anything. He CHOOSES <br/>
where he spends his time.<br/>
<br/>
You just told us a week or two ago that you have no passions except for <br/>
the computer---now you&#39;re telling us that you have no time for your <br/>
passion of singing.<br/>
<br/>
Drop the computer time! Go sing! Quit whining!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
 And then there is this big ammount of<br/>
millions of people who want the same, there is always someone who is<br/>
more skilled than I am (in singing, or in getting to know the &quot;right&quot;<br/>
people, in advertising himself, in arranging, in composing etc...)<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
PuhLEEZE! Quit yer bitchin&#39;!<br/>
<br/>
Thats what business is ABOUT! Being more skilled, more talented. <br/>
Knowing more people, advertising yourself, arranging, composing. THAT&#39;s <br/>
what the music industry IS.<br/>
<br/>
Are you willing to DO those things? Don&#39;t go telling me that it&#39;s not <br/>
possible! I have a now 18 year old son who networks all OVER town and <br/>
knows ALL the big names here because he would go out every <br/>
night---since he was 15---to hear music and sit in on workshops and ask <br/>
questions and introduce himself to strangers and play at every possible <br/>
opportunity. And he&#39;s SHY! Well, he *was*! &lt;g&gt; He MADE the <br/>
opportunities FOR himself. I can&#39;t go anywhere in town now with him <br/>
without someone coming up to speak to him about music or film. He&#39;s put <br/>
himself OUT there.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s not unique (well, he IS! &lt;g&gt;)---but this is how you make it in the <br/>
music business---you network. You play. You sing.<br/>
<br/>
You DON&#39;T sit in your apartment and whine that you can&#39;t sing!!!<br/>
<br/>
--=-=-=-==--=<br/>
<br/>
I used to think &quot;if you only *want* something enough, you&#39;ll get it&quot;,<br/>
you just have to work hard, be creative, find ways etc etc. But this<br/>
is quite like the &quot;American Dream&quot; – if you really want it, you WILL<br/>
get it, it promises, but if you don&#39;t and stay poor, and don&#39;t<br/>
succeed to always get a greater job and get  more money – it means<br/>
you are lazy &quot;then you just didn&#39;t work hard enough&quot;. This is just<br/>
not the case, because not all people have equal opportunities!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
This is just an excuse. The ONLY way people have made it IS by being <br/>
creative, working hard, finding ways.<br/>
<br/>
ALL people have equal opportunities. Opportunities are OUT there. <br/>
Everywhere. Every day. But you&#39;re not going to find them sitting in a <br/>
room. Get OUT---go to clubs. Sing for tips. Sing for free. Just sing! <br/>
Sing at Open Mike Night---that&#39;s how Cameron ot his first paying gig! <br/>
He would go every Wednesday night to Open Mike Night. He played the <br/>
drums. Eventually the owner/band leader hired him as the house drummer <br/>
when his old drummer moved to be with his dying mother. Cameron has a <br/>
year contract with &quot;Fatback and the Groove Band&quot; as their drummer. A <br/>
paying gig. Just for showing up every Wednesday for four months!<br/>
<br/>
OH! And their singer is also a waitress there--she gets up and sings <br/>
between tables! She can belt out some blues!!! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
And<br/>
though what I used to think had nothing to do with the American Dream<br/>
in the sense of growing rich out of nothing, it still implies that if<br/>
you don&#39;t succeed in what you &quot;wanted&quot; – then you probably didn&#39;t<br/>
want it enough, or you didn&#39;t try hard enough or you are just lazy or<br/>
dumb or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
-=--=-<br/>
<br/>
Uh huh. But you&#39;re going to tell me that you want it enough and are <br/>
trying hard enough and aren&#39;t lazy or whatever---right?<br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t see you out at night singing! You&#39;re spending all your time <br/>
on the computer---you told us so!<br/>
<br/>
You won&#39;t even sing at Christmas in front of your parents!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And thinking that &quot;if you only want somehting<br/>
enough..&quot; made me confident I *would* get it – but I don&#39;t see it<br/>
happening at all, and this is since 10, 15 years now.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you were at ALL confident. I don&#39;t think you have been <br/>
out singing anywhere. For 10-15 years---you just *wished* you were a <br/>
rich and famous singer. *Wanting* something enough and *Going AFTER* <br/>
something enough are two completely diferent things!<br/>
<br/>
Easy to say you weren&#39;t responsible for that.<br/>
<br/>
Easy to blame parents the FIRST 10-15 years---but after that, it&#39;s up <br/>
to YOU!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 So the<br/>
disappointment of not getting what I wanted has caused many tears<br/>
over the past 5 years because my goal seems farther and farther away.<br/>
<br/>
-==-=-<br/>
<br/>
And WHAT are you DOing about it?<br/>
<br/>
Throwing a pity party or going out and singing every night?<br/>
<br/>
-=-==-=-<br/>
<br/>
So unschooled children, won&#39;t they always be very confident they<br/>
&quot;will&quot; get what they want and then be also as disappointed as I am<br/>
about not getting it? I&#39;m learning to deal with it though but it has<br/>
taken years of crying each month for not being completely happy<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
First: Yes, I hope they will be very confident---beats the hell out of <br/>
lacking confidence, wouldn&#39;t you say?<br/>
<br/>
Second: Their disappointments won&#39;t come from NOT trying.<br/>
<br/>
Third: &quot;Dealing&quot; with it and &quot;Doing&quot; something about it are two <br/>
completely different things. Mine will be/are DOERS.<br/>
<br/>
Fourth: NO one is &quot;completely happy.&quot; We can choose to be joyful, and <br/>
we can choose to find joy in what we have and in what we&#39;re seeking. We <br/>
can choose to enjoy the journey. Crying every night because we haven&#39;t <br/>
put forth the effort will never make someone happy either. But going <br/>
after what we love because we LOVE is can be joyful and inspiring.<br/>
<br/>
Go sing!<br/>

<br/>
I simply said that I didn&#39;t have any help from my parents – neither<br/>
to just &quot;live&quot; (financial support or something) nor to pursue my<br/>
dreams. Actually, they had a lot of money at the time and I wanted to<br/>
study music. To study music, I had to, by the curriculum of the<br/>
university, perform a piece on a piano. I asked piano teachers if it<br/>
would be possible to learn a piece good enough in half a year as to<br/>
perform and get accepted. It was possible and many people do it this<br/>
way, they said. I asked my parents for piano lessons at the time but<br/>
they said it wasn&#39;t the right choice for me and it was stupid to<br/>
think I could pursue a musical career because &quot;all good musicians<br/>
start at 3 years old&quot; or something like that. They didn&#39;t believe in<br/>
me and still don&#39;t do (ever since I&#39;m nervous when I am to sing in<br/>
front of them (Christmas etc.), a vicious cycle: I know I will be<br/>
nervous and being nervous my voice won&#39;t be as good and then again I<br/>
will not be able to &quot;prove it&quot; and then I get more nervous and of<br/>
course I sing badly....) and well, I couldn&#39;t do it at the time.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
So---back to the original question: &quot;Should I always get what I want?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How did your parents&#39; way get you what you want? How&#39;s that working out <br/>
for you?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
to pay singing lessons.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Screw the singing lessons---go SING!<br/>
<br/>
-==-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t quite understand your issue with blaming the parents. Of<br/>
course, if you as a parent GIVE free choice, then nobody can blame<br/>
you. If the parents DON&#39;T GIVE free choice and are rather your<br/>
enemies, putting stones in your way, how could I not blame them?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Parents can help or hinder. Your hindered. Mine helped. Who has the <br/>
better mind-set?<br/>
<br/>
I think that blame should be short-lived. Disinterested/hindering <br/>
parents certainly deserve blame---I think that a parent&#39;s contributions <br/>
can be HUGE! And a aprenat who doesn&#39;t contribute at all is at fault. <br/>
That&#39;s why I choose to be my children&#39;s facilitator as much as humanly <br/>
possible.<br/>
<br/>
But after a few years out on your own, it&#39;s time to take responsibility <br/>
for your *own* actions---or INactions.<br/>
<br/>
-=-===-=-<br/>
<br/>
And anyway, I wasn&#39;t blaming them – I was just trying to explain the<br/>
situation I was it, and show how badly I wanted to sing, that I even<br/>
did a shitty job I hated for it, and this in the context of &quot;bad<br/>
times&quot; cause I wasn&#39;t financially supported by my parents.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-==-=-<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s history---what are you dong about it NOW?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We can sit and stew about how bad our parents were. And we can whine <br/>
about how we&#39;ve turned out. And we can blame our parents for not being <br/>
there for us.<br/>
<br/>
We can choose to heal ourselves and become what we always wanted of <br/>
ourselves---AND we can choose to be the parents we wished we&#39;d had.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
My mother also says she&#39;s not responsible for my feelings. So if she<br/>
ever treats me bad, and I feel bad – it&#39;s not her fault, since it&#39;s<br/>
&quot;up to me&quot; if I feel bad!! Good logic! This way you are never guilty<br/>
and never wrong with what you do, then you never have to change<br/>
anything even if you hurt other people! And I&#39;m never allowed to<br/>
blame her? Hm, maybe you could explain, because I don&#39;t really<br/>
understand, or I&#39;m thinking really wrong :-) I&#39;m up to be convinced!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
If she makes a habit of making you feel bad, whose fault is THAT? I <br/>
mean---you don&#39;t have to live with her any more---and you don&#39;t have to <br/>
take her shit. At this point, you&#39;re CHOOSING to!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d tell that that she is right---she&#39;s not responsible. *I* am. And <br/>
because my feelings are important to me, I&#39;ll choose not to spend time <br/>
with those who hurt my feelings. She can choose whether to say hurtful <br/>
things or not---but YOU are choosing whether to put yourself in that <br/>
position. If the situation remains like this---THEN who&#39;s to blame?<br/>
<br/>
You can blame her all you want, and you will always be her child. But <br/>
you are not living under her roof any more. And if you are not willing <br/>
to allow her to hurt you, YOU are the one with the power---not her.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s YOUR choice!<br/>
<br/>

How do you ever get things done for yourself? Maybe it&#39;s easier for<br/>
you when you do things that don&#39;t require really quiet moments. For<br/>
recording, good recording, it needs to be really quiet.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I know you don&#39;t think so, but you really are just making excuses.<br/>
<br/>
Having *liitle* children can make it difficult---sometime almost <br/>
impossible---but it *can* be done with creative thinking.<br/>
<br/>
Trade a homemade soup (simmering while you practice/record) for child <br/>
care with an elderly neighbor.<br/>
<br/>
Trade Spanish lessons with a 14 year old for child care.<br/>
<br/>
Include the kids in the singing/playing---maracas/children&#39;s voices. <br/>
Sind & play at the park---out LOUD, while your children play---set out <br/>
a hat to accept donations! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Offer to sing at nearby kindergartens. Wear silly costumes. Make up <br/>
children&#39;s songs---Raffi had to start *somewhere*! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Think outside the box---you don&#39;t need lessons---you need to sing. Sing <br/>
all day. Every day.<br/>

 I have two<br/>
teenager girls that I have talked extensively to.  I highly recommend <br/>
they<br/>
pursue higher education. Strive for their dreams.  But am I to continue <br/>
to feed<br/>
and house them if they chose to not pursue a life in their adulthood?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And your options to continuing to house and feed them would be...?<br/>
<br/>
How does one not pursue a life in adulthood?<br/>
<br/>
What does that mean?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=--=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
   If she chooses not to follow through nor do any research for herself, <br/>
should I<br/>
continue to carry her?  There comes a point that one makes choices for <br/>
oneself.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And so---what would you do? Change the locks? Move with no forwarding <br/>
address?<br/>
<br/>
I would hope that unschoolers would be making choices for themselves <br/>
too---but do you have a specific *point* in mind???<br/>
<br/>
Eighteen? Twenty-five? Thirty-three? Nine??? I mean---what&#39;s this magic <br/>
&quot;point&quot; at which someone makes his own choices?<br/>
