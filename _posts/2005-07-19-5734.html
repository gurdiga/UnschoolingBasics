<div id="ygrps-yiv-1924939110">Several messages sat in the queue a long time, sorry about that.  The<br/>
mods have busy lives and were tied up.  <br/>
<br/>
I lost one message entirely and I apologize to whoever you are.  If you<br/>
want to send it again please do.  I&#39;m not sure how I lost it but it is<br/>
gone.  Poof.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m posting the list description here because I thought it might be<br/>
helpful to remind new people this is a list for the discussion of the<br/>
unschooling philosophy as applied to all of life. <br/>

List Introduction:<br/>
<br/>
A list designed for those new to the philosophy of unschooling. Ask<br/>
experienced unschoolers all those niggling questions, and find out how<br/>
unschooling works in real families.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re familiar with John Holt&#39;s work, but unsure of how to begin or<br/>
what an unschooling day really looks like, this is a place for you to<br/>
discuss,question, ponder and become deeply familiar with natural learning<br/>
and how it affects our entire lives. From parenting issues to learning<br/>
from the whole wide world and beyond, come explore the issues that<br/>
unschooling families have dealt with in the past and how to get beyond<br/>
&quot;school-think&quot; to a joyful unschooling lifestyle!</div>
