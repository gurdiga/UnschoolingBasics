one of  the things that happen <br/>
frequently around here that leave me wondering how  a cookie cutter <br/>
unschooling life <br/>
could ever work for  us.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think there is no such thing as a &quot;cookie cutter unschooling life&quot; first  <br/>
off. we all are so different - its perhaps one of the base levels of  <br/>
unschooling. each household will be different, doing different things. Science  looks <br/>
one way here, different at someone else&#39;s house, same with math, english,  <br/>
dance, music...the thread that ties us together is the joy of learning, with the  <br/>
child directing the interests. We provide things, options and items and time <br/>
and  patience. We listen to the children, we respect the kids&#39; needs and <br/>
interests  and are supporting them. We help them decide, we talk, we value their <br/>
pov&#39;s and  their ideas. We support that love of learning we ALL had/have...and in <br/>
the  process, we also often get that love and easy joy of learning back into <br/>
our own  lives that way. <br/>
 <br/>
We protect our kids from danger by talking with them about the danger. We  <br/>
help them to make choices by discussion. Nothing should simply be &quot;just because&quot; <br/>
 but because there is an understanding. I DO have some limits - say, I won&#39;t <br/>
buy  Minute Maid Juice Boxes at Target. It has High Fructose Corn Syrup in it. <br/>
But I  WILL buy the lemonade juice boxes from Trader Joe&#39;s because they <br/>
don&#39;t. Julian  is 4 and he knows this. I&#39;d rather him not have lemonade vs juice <br/>
due to added  sugars, but hey - this is a compromise. It helps him learn about <br/>
nutrition,  patience, supports his desire for his lemonade and supports my <br/>
desire to not  have him swallow that stuff ;) He gets it because we talk about it, <br/>
talk about  why and make arrangements for his needs to be met. <br/>
 <br/>
As for running into the street...some kids are more compulsive than others  <br/>
and may be so excited about the prospect of what is on the other side of the  <br/>
road, that they just aren&#39;t ready to self contain. That&#39;s ok. Because if one  <br/>
knows their child, we can use prevention instead of fear. We can come to the  <br/>
street area knowing that this is something that may happen. We then deal with  <br/>
that accordingly. For some kids, that may mean not being in that kind of  <br/>
situation for a bit, for some that may mean a verbal reminder, for some it might  <br/>
mean a simple discussion of how people in cars can&#39;t easily see smaller people <br/>
 and we have to look out for ourselves. <br/>
 <br/>
The point with all of this, is not to give examples of each situation, but  <br/>
to say that we each tailor our parenting to our children&#39;s needs. We must know  <br/>
our children, and unschooling I feel, provides the most excellent way to <br/>
really  KNOW them. We play with them, work with them, cook with them, love and <br/>
live with  them. By knowing them well, we can care for them WITH them. We become <br/>
partners -  Child-Parent partners...and since we are all so different...there <br/>
are no cookie  cutter unschoolers :) <br/>
 <br/>
OK, so I took the long route saying that ;) But I hope that helps a bit. We  <br/>
are so lucky, I feel, to have this time wit our kids. It takes some  <br/>
responsibility, and some adjustment. But oh, the pay-off...it&#39;s wonderful. <br/>
 <br/>
OK, back to more reading. I don&#39;t often reply like that, I&#39;m the novel  <br/>
writer about my life and am always hoping for support and learning, lol, so the  <br/>
rest I&#39;ll leave to those that do that so darned well.  <br/>

Getting  another persons &quot;ok&quot; on being part of something is simply a<br/>
way to respect  personal boundaries. If the person hasn&#39;t agreed, then<br/>
they can&#39;t be shot  at. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yup, I agree with Ren. This is one of those times that yes, we DO say &quot;no&quot;  <br/>
but we are then in a situation in which we MUST offer different alternatives.  <br/>
All needs met that way...that was what I was leading to in my novella of <br/>
earlier  ;) That teaches respect, by giving to it to all concerned...<br/>

<br/>

&gt; buy  Minute Maid Juice Boxes at Target. It has High Fructose Corn Syrup in it. <br/>
<br/>
THANK YOU Karen for admitting to a no!!!!!  Seriously, it actually helps me see better how <br/>
everyone can have their needs met, including our needs for.....nutrition, health, safety, <br/>
etc..<br/>
<br/>
&gt; But I  WILL buy the lemonade juice boxes from Trader Joe&#39;s because they <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t. Julian  is 4 and he knows this. I&#39;d rather him not have lemonade vs juice <br/>

<br/>
I see what you&#39;re saying.  It sounds like there was a &quot;no&quot; there, but you found another way <br/>
to meet the need.  I get that.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; As for running into the street...some kids are more compulsive than others  <br/>
&gt; and may be so excited about the prospect of what is on the other side of the  <br/>
&gt; road, that they just aren&#39;t ready to self contain. That&#39;s ok. Because if one  <br/>

&gt; mean a simple discussion of how people in cars can&#39;t easily see smaller people <br/>
&gt;  and we have to look out for ourselves. <br/>
<br/>
Yes.  And like you said, for some that may mean helping them understand that cars can&#39;t <br/>
easily see smaller people, etc..  But thank you for acknowledging that &quot;(f)or some kids, that <br/>
may mean not being in that kind of situation for a bit.&quot;  There&#39;s another &quot;no.&quot;  I see <br/>
though, that if we need to, in the process of meeting their needs, we can say (if only in our <br/>
heads) &quot;No.&quot;  Then go on to find another way to meet the need they are experiencing.<br/>
  <br/>
&gt; The point with all of this, is not to give examples of each situation, but  <br/>
&gt; to say that we each tailor our parenting to our children&#39;s needs. We must know  <br/>

&gt; live with  them. By knowing them well, we can care for them WITH them. We become <br/>
&gt; partners -  Child-Parent partners...<br/>
<br/>
I agree with all of this, and already parent this way....not to my best ability yet, but <br/>
philosophically I do not struggle with this.  This, the way you put it, doesn&#39;t sound as <br/>
extreme as I otherwise see it.  (CAn&#39;t think of a better word than extreme.  Please no one <br/>
pick at that.  It&#39;s almost 2 in the morning....I&#39;m doing my best.)<br/>
  <br/>
&gt; OK, so I took the long route saying that ;) But I hope that helps a bit. We  <br/>
&gt; are so lucky, I feel, to have this time wit our kids. It takes some  <br/>
&gt; responsibility, and some adjustment. But oh, the pay-off...it&#39;s wonderful. <br/>
<br/>
You do help.  Thank you.  I agree that it is (well, most of the time) wonderful.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; OK, back to more reading. I don&#39;t often reply like that, I&#39;m the novel  <br/>
&gt; writer about my life and am always hoping for support and learning, lol, so the  <br/>
&gt; rest I&#39;ll leave to those that do that so darned well.  <br/>
<br/>
You did well, in my opinion.  I think I can hear the softer viewpoint.  I think some people <br/>
start with the extreme to make the point, and it&#39;s actually harder that way for me.  Better <br/>
to find common ground first, then you don&#39;t see so far apart from one another, rather than <br/>
polarizing right from the get go.  <br/>

Yes, but  my son repeatedly, all day long, does not repsect others&#39; personal  <br/>
boudaries.  It is <br/>
a real problem with him, and for his little brother  who gets hurt (not <br/>
injured, mind you) by <br/>
him every day of his life.   (This, by the way is a HUGE issue for me.  It <br/>
kills me that I can&#39;t  <br/>
make my one son be kinder and gentler to my other son.  It kills me  that my <br/>
little son has <br/>
to live everyday having his body  disrespected.  It kills me that he hates <br/>
his big brother.  It  <br/>
kills me that my big son has a little brother who hates him when he should  <br/>
have a little <br/>
brother who adroes him and looks up to him.    Doesn&#39;t anybody out there have <br/>
a child like  <br/>
this??!!)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to comment to you that I really hear your pain and your  <br/>
confusion. I can tell it&#39;s really bothering you and you are trying SO hard to  <br/>
learn, help, do what&#39;s right, AND take care of a family and yourself. That&#39;s a  <br/>
LOT, and I know that too, from my issues I&#39;ve been having. It&#39;s not just the  <br/>
same, but I can SO relate to the feelings you are having (don&#39;t know if you saw  <br/>
my novel long post about my teens and my issues with my eldest - hard <br/>
situation,  hoping for something to help me cope, you know? Advice, something...it&#39;s a <br/>
 toughie.) <br/>
 <br/>
I also wanted to mention that not too long ago, right as I joined, there  <br/>
were a few people that had joined that were very argumentative and were  <br/>
basically calling the parents here &quot;unparents&quot; as if they did not parent their  <br/>
children, and let them run wild. I think it put some of us on the defensive, so  <br/>
when a post comes through that sounds as if unschooling is being challenged, yet  <br/>
again, the patience level is harder to maintain. You might be hearing some  <br/>
stress and defensiveness based upon that - not that I presume to speak for the  <br/>
people that have replied, it&#39;s just an observation I have noticed. I think <br/>
tone  is often lost in emails, and when tensions are running high and <br/>
frustration is  too, we may well misread someone&#39;s intentions - wether it&#39;s a reply or a <br/>
 question to the group. <br/>
 <br/>
I want to say too, that you appear to really be trying to find  creative <br/>
solutions. You&#39;re asking, you are thinking, feeling and stumbling  around they way <br/>
most of us humans do at times ;)  I sure am doing a  lot of stumbling myself <br/>
these days! I have the virtually bruised toes from the  virtual stubbing I&#39;ve <br/>
been doing, lol...<br/>
 <br/>
The answers will come with you and your son, in time. As we all continue to  <br/>
stay open with our kids and our feelings, the answers come. Parenting from the <br/>
 heart is the goal we all have here, and that will, of course, look a bit  <br/>
different from home to home any times. But the connection - the heart and the  <br/>
children - are the basics we all do have. <br/>
 <br/>
I wish you luck! It&#39;ll be ok. Keep listening to your very heart of hearts. <br/>
 <br/>
Karen <br/>

<br/>
Well, thank you! :) <br/>
 <br/>
Maybe we should all discuss some of the times we DO say &quot;no.&quot; I say it more  <br/>
than just the Minute Maid juice boxes, lol. I&#39;m earthy and honest with my <br/>
kids.  The relationship we have is good for that, their personalities are good for <br/>
 that. Julian, is my most sensitive and gentle child. I can&#39;t tease him or be <br/>
as  earthy with him - so I&#39;m not. He would get his feelings hurt. So I am <br/>
adjusting  my mothering to each child...and with 5 of them, sometimes I feel as <br/>
if I have  multiple personalities via mothering, lol! It&#39;s not an area I <br/>
question about  myself however, since the kids are fairly comfy, as am I, kwim? <br/>
 <br/>
I already replied to another bit of your emails, so I&#39;ll stop for now -  just <br/>
wanted to let you know that about me. <br/>
 <br/>
Take care! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-796934187">I have never posted here before. The references to Tourette&#39;s caught <br/>
my attention.  My son has Tourette&#39;s. Impulse control is most <br/>
definately an issue for him. He truly struggles with it. He has gone <br/>
through many tics over the past few years. Some of them have been <br/>
hurtful to those around him and some have been hurtful to himself.<br/>
 We do talk about alternatives to some of the tics. And have managed <br/>
to curtail some of them.<br/>
 Some of them however we just have to hope will pass eventually. <br/>
 Fortuanately my son has not developed the swearing form (which is <br/>
rare by the way) of Tourette&#39;s. He has peeped, poked, throat cleared, <br/>
tongue thrusted, blinked, chewed, slapped (himself and others). He <br/>
has also attacked others because of the echoeing inside his head. <br/>
Large groups of people are overwhelming for him. He has a form of <br/>
echolalia. Only he doesn&#39;t repeat out loud what is said.. Instead he <br/>
hears everything that is said to him over and over and over again. <br/>
That gets confusing when there are lots of kids yelling (playing) at <br/>
the same time.  There are times that even the sound of someone <br/>
writing in the other room is unbareable to him.<br/>
 There are many adjustments that have been made in our lives to <br/>
accomodate his special needs. His older sister understands those <br/>
accomodations. Just as I understood the accomodations that needed to <br/>
be made for my 2 MR older brothers when we were children.<br/>
 There are times on lists such as these when I feel like there is <br/>
truly a lack of understanding for parents of children with special <br/>
needs. Parenting a child with special needs is a whole different <br/>
world than parenting a &quot;normal&quot; child.  With my daughter I can reason <br/>
an compromise. With my son things need to be straight forward. The <br/>
less words the better. A simple yes or no works well for him in most <br/>
situations. Going through all of the reasons for the yes or no has <br/>
led to much confusion for him.<br/>
 I am not certain if I will ever embrace all of the unschooling <br/>
philosophy as I have seen it presented time and time again. It seems <br/>
that if one strays from the philosophy then there is harsh judgement <br/>
and snarky comments. Rather than embracing the person for even asking <br/>
a valid question. Seems a bit narrow to me. I much prefer to attempt <br/>
to understand where another person is coming from than be so quick to <br/>
rush a judgement on them as a parent.<br/>
 There is more than one right way. The key is to find what works for <br/>
your family.<br/>
<br/>
 Back to lurking for me :)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes.  And like you said, for some that may mean helping them <br/>
 </span></blockquote>understand that cars can&#39;t <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; easily see smaller people, etc..  But thank you for acknowledging <br/>
 </span></blockquote>that &quot;(f)or some kids, that <br/>

 </span></blockquote>another &quot;no.&quot;  I see <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; though, that if we need to, in the process of meeting their needs, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>we can say (if only in our <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; heads) &quot;No.&quot;  Then go on to find another way to meet the need they <br/>
 </span></blockquote>are experiencing.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   <br/>
&gt; &gt; The point with all of this, is not to give examples of each <br/>
 </span></blockquote>situation, but  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; to say that we each tailor our parenting to our children&#39;s needs. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>We must know  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; our children, and unschooling I feel, provides the most excellent <br/>
 </span></blockquote>way to <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; really  KNOW them. We play with them, work with them, cook with <br/>
 </span></blockquote>them, love and <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; live with  them. By knowing them well, we can care for them WITH <br/>
 </span></blockquote>them. We become <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; partners -  Child-Parent partners...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I agree with all of this, and already parent this way....not to my <br/>
 </span></blockquote>best ability yet, but <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; philosophically I do not struggle with this.  This, the way you put <br/>

 </span></blockquote>extreme.  Please no one <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; pick at that.  It&#39;s almost 2 in the morning....I&#39;m doing my best.)<br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt; &gt; OK, so I took the long route saying that ;) But I hope that helps <br/>
 </span></blockquote>a bit. We  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; are so lucky, I feel, to have this time wit our kids. It takes <br/>
 </span></blockquote>some  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>wonderful. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; You do help.  Thank you.  I agree that it is (well, most of the <br/>

&gt; &gt; OK, back to more reading. I don&#39;t often reply like that, I&#39;m the <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; rest I&#39;ll leave to those that do that so darned well.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You did well, in my opinion.  I think I can hear the softer <br/>
 </span></blockquote>viewpoint.  I think some people <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; start with the extreme to make the point, and it&#39;s actually harder <br/>
 </span></blockquote>that way for me.  Better <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to find common ground first, then you don&#39;t see so far apart from <br/>
