<div id="ygrps-yiv-868979222">we just got this game yesterday. We have not figured out how to get a code yet to play online but my kids are sure loving to play. I will check to see in a bit how to find the code and I know my 11 year old son would love to play against others.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-292681427">Hi Juli,<br/>
<br/>
Come join us in Arizona!<br/>
Life is GREAT here in Tucson.<br/>
And very unschooling friendly!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been here since Dec 2000 (moved here from Dallas) and we love it!<br/>
<br/>
We just recently attended the 2nd annual homeschool conference in Phoenix<br/>
sponsored by HENA (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://hena.us/)">http://hena.us/)</a>.<br/>
It was very unschool friendly and loads of fun.<br/>
<br/>
We belong to two local groups - Sonoran Desert Homeschoolers (<br/>
tucsonhomeschoolers.org) and SOARing unschoolers (<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.soaringunschoolers.com/)">http://www.soaringunschoolers.com/)</a>.<br/>
Loads of parkdays, field trips, festivals, classes, etc.<br/>
<br/>

Tuscan. there are co housing communities over there that i would love to  see <br/>
and be a part of. or anything like that.  I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s hotter than  <br/>
south Florida though, plus we deal with humidity here. so I&#39;m not sure if sunny  <br/>
Arizona is much different than sunny Florida except we&#39;re very tropical and <br/>
have  all the hurricane issues to deal with and the year long humidity that makes <br/>
it  seem even hotter. 2004 and 2005 were particularly harsh on us. our roof <br/>
being  tossed on our car for one thing. a tree landing in my kitchen a year <br/>
later. lol.  it&#39;s been quiet 2006 and 2007 but our homeowner insurance has bolted <br/>
to new  heights. well we do live in hurricane valley....<br/>
