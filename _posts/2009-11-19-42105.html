<div id="ygrps-yiv-1542445085">My 10 y.o. has been told by her neighborhood friend that school is &quot;fun&quot; and now this has sparked her interest.  Trouble is, she doesn&#39;t read yet and only knows addition and subtraction.  She&#39;s interested in learning what she needs to know for whatever grade she&#39;ll be in (if she goes).  I&#39;m thinking going to the school and asking but am in fear of getting &quot;in trouble&quot; (not by the law, just berated) for not having taught her these things yet.   Mind you, this was just MENTIONED yesterday as she says she&#39;s &quot;thinking about it&quot;, so this could just be a passing fancy!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Asking what skills are expected doesn&#39;t need to involve you telling  <br/>
the school what skills your daughter has or doesn&#39;t have. It&#39;s just a  <br/>
request for information.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a list here:<br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s also What Your 5th Grader Needs to Know:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/yzbwrjw">http://tinyurl.com/yzbwrjw</a><br/>
(and links to the other years if she&#39;d be in 4th)<br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s concerned about not knowing &quot;enough&quot; I&#39;d point out that  <br/>
instead of going in school order, she&#39;s also learned 8th grade stuff  <br/>
and 12th grade stuff and college stuff and adult stuff because she  <br/>
can go in any order that feels right to her. Kids in school have to  <br/>
learn in the order the schools decide because there&#39;s 30 kids and  <br/>
only 1 teacher. It&#39;s sort of like one bus driver and a bus full of  <br/>
kids. They all have to go to visit the same places at the same time  <br/>
whether they&#39;re interested in those places or not. But she has just  <br/>
you and she can decide where she&#39;d like you to take her today.<br/>

***My oldest has always been interested in school in various ways. We have<br/>
always unschooled though lived in the midst of mainstream (who doesn&#39;t). I<br/>
think some kids find it more attractive than others. For many years, we<br/>
played school (her versions), and she enjoys TV shows about school and books<br/>
where the characters go to school.<br/>

she&#39;ll be in (if she goes).<br/>
<br/>
***Malila found that it didn&#39;t really matter what she knew before going to<br/>
school. She did no special preparation. She wasn&#39;t starting school to<br/>
&quot;learn&quot;, she was/is interested in the *experience* of school. It took her<br/>
only 2 weeks to &quot;catch up&quot; to them. Seriously, two weeks to be &quot;on par&quot; with<br/>
kids who have been going to school for 8 years!<br/>

***Like other said it isn&#39;t necessary to speak to anyone about it. If she is<br/>
worried about not reading than help alleviate her fears. It&#39;s ok not to<br/>
read.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Faith, that&#39;s such a great point - and one in the eye for public education. Two weeks! Makes me want to dance around the yard singing &quot;Nyeh, nyeh ny nyeh, nyeh!&quot; Not terribly mature of me but So There! <br/>
<br/>
This is something I&#39;ve heard from other families who have had kids try out school - that its important for parents to realize Why the kids want to do it. Its not about getting a school style education, most of the time, its that there&#39;s a whole &#39;nother *world* in there, and its fascinating to study that world. Our kids Are scientists and explorers, they aren&#39;t just pretending to be those things. Their desire to study this strange foreign culture at their very doorsteps is as valid as a desire to study animation or dance. <br/>
