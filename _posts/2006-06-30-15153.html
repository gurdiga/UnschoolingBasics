<div id="ygrps-yiv-149027494">While no one is tied up or forced to do anything I think people come <br/>
to this list hoping to find gentle advice on how to ease into <br/>
unschooling. I know I did.<br/>
<br/>
 I have felt the eletist attitude come across here too. I have felt <br/>
it was not safe to post here. the funny thing is that I know a <br/>
couple people from this list in person and the reason I have not yet <br/>
left is because I know for sure that if they were speaking to me in <br/>
person that they would not be coming across as eletist. Some people <br/>
I do not know in person have come across in posts as concerned, <br/>
supportive and caring. <br/>
<br/>
which has led me to wonder why the difference.<br/>
<br/>
I have spent plenty of time wondering if text removes an attitude of <br/>
concern and instead brings in the feeling of cold indifference and <br/>
snobbery or if perhaps people feel that they can just lay it all out <br/>
without the kind and gentle trimmings they would add if they were <br/>
face to face.<br/>
<br/>
I know from working in the animal rescue field for a long while that <br/>
eventualy you get sick of people, the way they ask for advice but <br/>
don&#39;t take it and then continue to whine and ask for more help. <br/>
eventualy people become hardened I think, I have. any more when <br/>
asked for advice in Animal training I tend to give it cut and dried <br/>
and.. well cold. bare bones and I&#39;m sure bordering on bitchy at <br/>
times. Perhaps this is how the &quot;old timers&quot; from this list feel. I <br/>
can&#39;t say.<br/>
<br/>
I rarely post here not because I wouldn&#39;t be getting the answers or <br/>
approval I want, but because it does not feel like a safe place to <br/>
post- I came to this conclusion by seeing what others sometimes get <br/>
put through when they post- I&#39;m pretty thick skinned, but no one <br/>
likes to feel they are not &#39;good&#39; enough to really be part of the <br/>
group. so I lurk about, trying to learn more. When I do post I let <br/>
the negitivity that is likely to come roll off me and try to sift <br/>
through to usefull information, because ultimatly my goal is to <br/>
learn about Unschooling from people who do it, who live it. not just <br/>
by reading some articles on line or a few books on the subject.<br/>
<br/>
So far I have come to the conclusion that Unschoolers are just <br/>
people.<br/>
Some are fanatical, rigid hardline thinkers and some are flexable to <br/>
the point of wishywashyness. Many fall somewhere in between. Do I <br/>
think these descriptions make some good and others bad? no. Just <br/>
different and as is said here many more times than I can count -- <br/>
everyone is different. we all think and learn and do things <br/>
diferently. Every one of you here on this list may have some peice <br/>
of advice, some turn of a phrase that I could take into myself, <br/>
somthing to contribute to me to help my family. <br/>
I learn and change by taking what is needed right now and leaving <br/>
the rest.<br/>
<br/>
Should I leave this list now that I have said this? <br/>

  We are told on other lists to come here because we don&#39;t know enough or aren&#39;t quite there yet or have a lot of questions.  But then when we are here we are told we aren&#39;t forced to be here and to go on.  So, is it that you don&#39;t want us in the other lists for the &quot;old timers&quot; or you don&#39;t want us on any lists that you belong to? This isn&#39;t an imflammatory question- I am very serious and have no feelings of anger, just curiosity. What is it about newbies asking questions and pushing the envelope that brings out ill feelings and comments like &quot;I&#39;ll know when you leave&quot; or affirmation that you think you are better than another mom because she isn&#39;t where you are yet in your parenting?  <br/>
   <br/>
  I know we aren&#39;t forced to be here. But what kind of answer is that to someone? It&#39;s very &quot;my way or the highway&quot;. Is it necessary to feel left out, picked on, or picked apart to stay here? Is it really okay to be harsh to new questioning people because &quot;they aren&#39;t forced to stay&quot;? <br/>

 From: Tina Layne &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:tinalayne@...">tinalayne@...</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 So, for this comment to be made is actually a little creepy...<br/>
 you&#39;ll know when we leave.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  People don&#39;t leave. They hang around. Even if they don&#39;t like what <br/>
we&#39;re saying. Why do I think that is?<br/>
<br/>
  As owner, I am notified when members sub and unsub. They often say <br/>
they will leave; they don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
  The list is feeding *something* in them. And many---most---eventually <br/>
make the huge paradigm shift (or at least a step or two in the <br/>
unschooling direction) that it takes to unschool. Then they start to <br/>
post and joyfully add to the conversations. There are at least a dozen <br/>
parents new to this list who are adding to the conversations regularly <br/>
now. It&#39;s fun to watch them jump in and scream, &quot;The water&#39;s FINE!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  *Anyone* can post and not be afraid of getting blasted. But she&#39;ll <br/>
have to *think* about what she posts first. Saying that &quot;a child <br/>
*needs* punishment or at least disapproval&quot; and then saying that she <br/>
didn&#39;t say that is not OK.<br/>
<br/>
  I have no problem being challenged. Challenge me. I like a debate. I <br/>
like answering unschooling questions. A lot. But I want to talk with <br/>
someone who *WANTS* to unschool. Who&#39;s TRYING to get there. If I wanted <br/>
to argue with someone for the sake of arguing, I could call one of my <br/>
sisters-in-law. Or go to the grocery store! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m tired of working with someone who doesn&#39;t want to unschool. There <br/>
are plenty of people who DO want to get it; I&#39;d rather save all my <br/>
energy for them.<br/>
<br/>
  On the plus side, maybe someone benefited from this last exchange. <br/>
Maybe something Ren or Pam or dear, patient Marji (or <br/>
godforbid---something *I* said) made a difference in some child&#39;s life <br/>
tonight.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  We are told on other lists to come here because we don&#39;t know enough <br/>
or aren&#39;t<br/>
  quite there yet or have a lot of questions. But then when we are here <br/>
we are<br/>
 told we aren&#39;t forced to be here and to go on.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  I think it&#39;s silly to think you can&#39;t ask questions. But *THINK* <br/>
before you ask. But badmouthing children is not going to go over well <br/>
here. Thinking poorly of them won&#39;t either. Do you want to know how it <br/>
works in our families? Or do you just want to argue that you way is <br/>
&quot;just as right&quot; as mine/ours? Punishing is NOT just as OK as not <br/>
punishing. Rewarding is NOT just as OK as not rewarding. Sending a <br/>
child to his room to think about it is NOT just as OK as hugging him <br/>
and making sure his needs are met (before you rant and rail).<br/>
<br/>
  There are mainstream answers you can get to almost every scenario <br/>
brought up here. Hell, just go ask Dr Phil or John (yuck!) Rosemond. <br/>
They will FILL you with mainstream parenting ideas---maybe even some <br/>
you haven&#39;t thought of! Jeez---you could just shout a question out your <br/>
back door and be blasted with well-meaning mainstream parenting &quot;tips&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
  But to get someone who will question *why* you think you need to do <br/>
that---there are only a few places that can do that. Why do you think <br/>
that is? Maybe we&#39;ve been questioned ourselves? Maybe we struggled and <br/>
have found a better way?<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 So, is it that you don&#39;t want us<br/>
 in the other lists for the &quot;old timers&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  The Always Learning list usually refers folks here because it&#39;s really <br/>
not for &quot;how do you get your kid to read or do math&quot; questions. They <br/>
talk more about deeper unschooling issues; that&#39;s why it was <br/>
started---for people who didn&#39;t *need* to hear AGAIN how to get your <br/>
child to learn history or do an experiment. A place to chat about <br/>
unschooling without the same old questions that come up every few weeks.<br/>
<br/>
  Unschooling Discussion is the &quot;mama&quot; list to all these. Again, I think <br/>
many of the regular readers there were also weary of the same old <br/>
newbie questions, but they can handle some serious debate. That list is <br/>
definitely for delving into the whys of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
  The Always Learning list is for parents of kids under eight-ish. I&#39;m a <br/>
member; I read occasionally and hardly ever post. But they&#39;re there to <br/>
discuss how unschooling works with littluns. I don&#39;t have littluns.<br/>
<br/>
  *This* list is for all those issues that scare new unschoolers: the <br/>
ones that other lists just don&#39;t want to touch AGAIN. And I admit, I <br/>
can get very tired of doing it again and again some days. But that&#39;s <br/>
why we started this list---so that people had a place to ask those <br/>
questions.<br/>
<br/>
  BUT we assume that, if you&#39;re here, you are ready to take the plunge. <br/>
Or, hell, are at least open to change. I have very little patience left <br/>
for those who just want to poke at me or at the list.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 or you don&#39;t want us on any lists that<br/>
  you belong to? This isn&#39;t an imflammatory question- I am very serious <br/>
and have<br/>
  no feelings of anger, just curiosity. What is it about newbies asking <br/>
questions<br/>
  and pushing the envelope that brings out ill feelings and comments <br/>
like &quot;I&#39;ll<br/>
  know when you leave&quot; or affirmation that you think you are better than <br/>
another<br/>
 mom because she isn&#39;t where you are yet in your parenting?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Is that what you saw?<br/>
<br/>
  *I* saw a woman who was here---NOT To get unschooling (she admitted <br/>
that), but to ask a few questions. When she was asked the same <br/>
questions BACK, she got defensive. She wasn&#39;t pushing *any* envelope: <br/>
she was fighting what she perceived as a challenge to her parenting. <br/>
The good thing is that she made some progress---I saw little lights go <br/>
off here and there. And even though she doesn&#39;t want to unschool some <br/>
of what she learned here *will* indeed stick with her. She *may* hate <br/>
me, but I&#39;m not out looking for friends! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I *do* think that I have found a better way of parenting, yes. *She* <br/>
came *here* asking questions. I did NOT go to her to push my view onto <br/>
her. I was asked questions and I asked back. I don&#39;t think she was sure <br/>
of her stance or her answers.<br/>
<br/>
  And again, as for the &quot;I&#39;ll know when you leave&quot; comment: none of you <br/>
(especially the poster who said she would) have left yet. Often the <br/>
poster will say she&#39;s leaving, but stay put for weeks, months.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I know we aren&#39;t forced to be here. But what kind of answer is that to<br/>
  someone? It&#39;s very &quot;my way or the highway&quot;. Is it necessary to feel <br/>
left out,<br/>
  picked on, or picked apart to stay here? Is it really okay to be harsh <br/>
to new<br/>
 questioning people because &quot;they aren&#39;t forced to stay&quot;?<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I don&#39;t understand why this is so difficult to understand.<br/>
<br/>
  You mean it&#39;s OK to complain about how lousy my party is while <br/>
enjoying my wine and hors d&#39;ouvres?<br/>
<br/>
  You don&#39;t have to stay at my party: you can find or host a party that <br/>
serves Schlitz and Saltines.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the *best* unschooling writers are here. Some of the *best* <br/>
unschooling parents I have ever met (and I&#39;ve met hundred and hundreds <br/>
in person) are here. Some of the absolute *gentlest* parents are here. <br/>
Do you not believe they are real?<br/>
<br/>
Well, I can understand that &quot;are they real?&quot; bit! &lt;g&gt; That&#39;s why the <br/>
conference was started in the first place: &#39;cause I wanted to meet all <br/>
of them and *see* that they were real.<br/>
<br/>
But do y&#39;all not believe that we get the &quot;results&quot; we say we do? Do you <br/>
not believe that we can shun chores and bedtimes and forced apologies  <br/>
and reading lessons and math workbooks and rewards and punishments and <br/>
*still* have amazingly kind, generous, and pleasant children? And not <br/>
just children, but TEENS!? Is it that far beyond comprehension?<br/>
<br/>
No need to actually answer. Just ask the question of yourself. If it <br/>
*is* unbelievable, maybe unschooling isn&#39;t for you. If you really can&#39;t <br/>
fathom such a life, maybe it isn&#39;t attainable. We *know* it is: we&#39;re <br/>
living it. And we&#39;re happy to share how to get there. But you really do <br/>
need to open up and believe in the possibility. And you need to be <br/>
willing to ask and answer some really difficult questions (and get <br/>
answers you may not be comfortable with!).<br/>
<br/>
But no one is making you. No one.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I certainly hope not! And I sincerely don&#39;t think this is what is going on. Topic discussions are welcomed. It&#39;s tearing down the list itself that gets tiresome.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m having a hard time understanding why the OP was feeling personally attcked in the rewards/punishment/Jalen-hugging discussion. It&#39;s hard to give an unschooling point of view in a discussion without comparing and contrasting it to a more traditional parenting style. That&#39;s not singling anyone out as bad or even traditional. (When did that get to be a bad word? lol) It&#39;s discussing the ideas.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not a list owner or moderator. I belong to no club, organization or elite clique. I *like* differing points of view because it gets a good discussion going. When someone asks a question, I give the best unschooling answer I have on hand. When someone gets snarky, old and new posters alike, I just assume they&#39;re having a bad moment for whatever reason. It has nothing to do with me coexisting with them out here in cyberland.  <br/>
<br/>
I am confident 100% of the time in my choice to unschool and parent as my children&#39;s partner. I wasn&#39;t always, but I am now. I&#39;ve seen the benefits. That&#39;s not to say you can&#39;t raise amazing kids a different way. It&#39;s just pointing out that what I was told repeatedly over the years from traditional sources was wrong. <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t need to punish to raise kids who know right from wrong. <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t need to shame for a child to feel bad about a misguided  action. <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t need to set a lot of rules to have a happy, peaceful, cooperative household.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t need to reward to keep my kids on the &quot;right&quot; path.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t need to teach  in order for them to learn.<br/>

I invite everyone to join us over there and look forward to learning more<br/>
from those of you that do!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Here is my descrip. of this new group:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Welcome, one and all! This forum is designed to be a safe place for members<br/>
to post their questions, concerns, ideas, experience and information about<br/>
unschooling as a lifestyle as well as any related concepts that may come up<br/>
without fear of persecution of any kind. We aim to be a kinder, gentler<br/>
alternative to more elite-seeming unschool lists and have indeed formed this<br/>
list at thier behest. We value the unique input of all members and<br/>
appreciate the diversity inherent in our ranks. We would like to encourage<br/>
veterans, newbies, and anyone even just exploring unschooling to post freely<br/>
and without reservation. We will do our best to support you, help you and of<br/>
course learn from you in turn in the most respectful way possible (no one is<br/>
perfect :)). <br/>
<br/>
In an appreciation for full disclosure, I will admit that *I* the list owner<br/>
am only just exploring unschooling at this point in time and do not consider<br/>
myself in any way to be an unschooling authority. It is my sincere hope<br/>
other more experienced unschoolers will join us here and kindly share their<br/>
insights.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1763348103">I may be changing the subject. I am sorry but I had so many post I couldn&#39;t keep up. I only read about half. I was wondering if we could maybe get back to unschooling. I really don&#39;t want to be rude but I still have so many questions.My head is spinning.So if this question was asked in past few days sorry. Like I said I had a hard time keeping up. My 11 and 7 have always gone to public school.  I really hate the thought of them  going back to school. I want to make sure it wouldn&#39;t to much of a shock for them.Because they are so used to being structured and everything being timed. What kind of adjustment periods do I need to know about? I probably sound very scattered brained, well that because I am.LOL Also do your conferences ever make it out to Michigan? Thanks for allowing in your group.<br/>

 <br/>
 So, for this comment to be made is actually a little creepy...<br/>
  you&#39;ll know when we leave.<br/>
 <br/>
 -=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
 People don&#39;t leave. They hang around. Even if they don&#39;t like what <br/>
 we&#39;re saying. Why do I think that is?<br/>
 <br/>
 As owner, I am notified when members sub and unsub. They often say <br/>
 they will leave; they don&#39;t.<br/>
 <br/>
 The list is feeding *something* in them. And many---most---eventually <br/>
 make the huge paradigm shift (or at least a step or two in the <br/>
 unschooling direction) that it takes to unschool. Then they start to <br/>
 post and joyfully add to the conversations. There are at least a dozen <br/>
 parents new to this list who are adding to the conversations regularly <br/>
 now. It&#39;s fun to watch them jump in and scream, &quot;The water&#39;s FINE!&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
 *Anyone* can post and not be afraid of getting blasted. But she&#39;ll <br/>
 have to *think* about what she posts first. Saying that &quot;a child <br/>
 *needs* punishment or at least disapproval&quot; and then saying that she <br/>
 didn&#39;t say that is not OK.<br/>
 <br/>
 I have no problem being challenged. Challenge me. I like a debate. I <br/>
 like answering unschooling questions. A lot. But I want to talk with <br/>
 someone who *WANTS* to unschool. Who&#39;s TRYING to get there. If I wanted <br/>
 to argue with someone for the sake of arguing, I could call one of my <br/>
 sisters-in-law. Or go to the grocery store! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
 I&#39;m tired of working with someone who doesn&#39;t want to unschool. There <br/>
 are plenty of people who DO want to get it; I&#39;d rather save all my <br/>
 energy for them.<br/>
 <br/>
 On the plus side, maybe someone benefited from this last exchange. <br/>
 Maybe something Ren or Pam or dear, patient Marji (or <br/>
 godforbid---something *I* said) made a difference in some child&#39;s life <br/>
 tonight.<br/>
 <br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
 We are told on other lists to come here because we don&#39;t know enough <br/>
 or aren&#39;t<br/>
   quite there yet or have a lot of questions. But then when we are here <br/>
 we are<br/>
  told we aren&#39;t forced to be here and to go on.<br/>
 <br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
 I think it&#39;s silly to think you can&#39;t ask questions. But *THINK* <br/>
 before you ask. But badmouthing children is not going to go over well <br/>
 here. Thinking poorly of them won&#39;t either. Do you want to know how it <br/>
 works in our families? Or do you just want to argue that you way is <br/>
 &quot;just as right&quot; as mine/ours? Punishing is NOT just as OK as not <br/>
 punishing. Rewarding is NOT just as OK as not rewarding. Sending a <br/>
 child to his room to think about it is NOT just as OK as hugging him <br/>
 and making sure his needs are met (before you rant and rail).<br/>
 <br/>
 There are mainstream answers you can get to almost every scenario <br/>
 brought up here. Hell, just go ask Dr Phil or John (yuck!) Rosemond. <br/>
 They will FILL you with mainstream parenting ideas---maybe even some <br/>
 you haven&#39;t thought of! Jeez---you could just shout a question out your <br/>
 back door and be blasted with well-meaning mainstream parenting &quot;tips&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
 But to get someone who will question *why* you think you need to do <br/>
 that---there are only a few places that can do that. Why do you think <br/>
 that is? Maybe we&#39;ve been questioned ourselves? Maybe we struggled and <br/>
 have found a better way?<br/>
 <br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
 So, is it that you don&#39;t want us<br/>
  in the other lists for the &quot;old timers&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
 The Always Learning list usually refers folks here because it&#39;s really <br/>
 not for &quot;how do you get your kid to read or do math&quot; questions. They <br/>
 talk more about deeper unschooling issues; that&#39;s why it was <br/>
 started---for people who didn&#39;t *need* to hear AGAIN how to get your <br/>
 child to learn history or do an experiment. A place to chat about <br/>
 unschooling without the same old questions that come up every few weeks.<br/>
 <br/>
 Unschooling Discussion is the &quot;mama&quot; list to all these. Again, I think <br/>
 many of the regular readers there were also weary of the same old <br/>
 newbie questions, but they can handle some serious debate. That list is <br/>
 definitely for delving into the whys of unschooling.<br/>
 <br/>
 The Always Learning list is for parents of kids under eight-ish. I&#39;m a <br/>
 member; I read occasionally and hardly ever post. But they&#39;re there to <br/>
 discuss how unschooling works with littluns. I don&#39;t have littluns.<br/>
 <br/>
 *This* list is for all those issues that scare new unschoolers: the <br/>
 ones that other lists just don&#39;t want to touch AGAIN. And I admit, I <br/>
 can get very tired of doing it again and again some days. But that&#39;s <br/>
 why we started this list---so that people had a place to ask those <br/>
 questions.<br/>
 <br/>
 BUT we assume that, if you&#39;re here, you are ready to take the plunge. <br/>
 Or, hell, are at least open to change. I have very little patience left <br/>
 for those who just want to poke at me or at the list.<br/>
 <br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
 or you don&#39;t want us on any lists that<br/>
   you belong to? This isn&#39;t an imflammatory question- I am very serious <br/>
 and have<br/>
   no feelings of anger, just curiosity. What is it about newbies asking <br/>
 questions<br/>
   and pushing the envelope that brings out ill feelings and comments <br/>
 like &quot;I&#39;ll<br/>
   know when you leave&quot; or affirmation that you think you are better than <br/>
 another<br/>
  mom because she isn&#39;t where you are yet in your parenting?<br/>
 <br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
 Is that what you saw?<br/>
 <br/>
 *I* saw a woman who was here---NOT To get unschooling (she admitted <br/>
 that), but to ask a few questions. When she was asked the same <br/>
 questions BACK, she got defensive. She wasn&#39;t pushing *any* envelope: <br/>
 she was fighting what she perceived as a challenge to her parenting. <br/>
 The good thing is that she made some progress---I saw little lights go <br/>
 off here and there. And even though she doesn&#39;t want to unschool some <br/>
 of what she learned here *will* indeed stick with her. She *may* hate <br/>
 me, but I&#39;m not out looking for friends! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
 I *do* think that I have found a better way of parenting, yes. *She* <br/>
 came *here* asking questions. I did NOT go to her to push my view onto <br/>
 her. I was asked questions and I asked back. I don&#39;t think she was sure <br/>
 of her stance or her answers.<br/>
 <br/>
 And again, as for the &quot;I&#39;ll know when you leave&quot; comment: none of you <br/>
 (especially the poster who said she would) have left yet. Often the <br/>
 poster will say she&#39;s leaving, but stay put for weeks, months.<br/>
 <br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
 I know we aren&#39;t forced to be here. But what kind of answer is that to<br/>
   someone? It&#39;s very &quot;my way or the highway&quot;. Is it necessary to feel <br/>
 left out,<br/>
   picked on, or picked apart to stay here? Is it really okay to be harsh <br/>
 to new<br/>
  questioning people because &quot;they aren&#39;t forced to stay&quot;?<br/>
  -=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
 I don&#39;t understand why this is so difficult to understand.<br/>
 <br/>
 You mean it&#39;s OK to complain about how lousy my party is while <br/>
 enjoying my wine and hors d&#39;ouvres?<br/>
 <br/>
 You don&#39;t have to stay at my party: you can find or host a party that <br/>
 serves Schlitz and Saltines.<br/>
 <br/>
 Some of the *best* unschooling writers are here. Some of the *best* <br/>
 unschooling parents I have ever met (and I&#39;ve met hundred and hundreds <br/>
 in person) are here. Some of the absolute *gentlest* parents are here. <br/>
 Do you not believe they are real?<br/>
 <br/>
 Well, I can understand that &quot;are they real?&quot; bit! &lt;g&gt; That&#39;s why the <br/>
 conference was started in the first place: &#39;cause I wanted to meet all <br/>
 of them and *see* that they were real.<br/>
 <br/>
 But do y&#39;all not believe that we get the &quot;results&quot; we say we do? Do you <br/>
 not believe that we can shun chores and bedtimes and forced apologies  <br/>
 and reading lessons and math workbooks and rewards and punishments and <br/>
 *still* have amazingly kind, generous, and pleasant children? And not <br/>
 just children, but TEENS!? Is it that far beyond comprehension?<br/>
 <br/>
 No need to actually answer. Just ask the question of yourself. If it <br/>
 *is* unbelievable, maybe unschooling isn&#39;t for you. If you really can&#39;t <br/>
 fathom such a life, maybe it isn&#39;t attainable. We *know* it is: we&#39;re <br/>
 living it. And we&#39;re happy to share how to get there. But you really do <br/>
 need to open up and believe in the possibility. And you need to be <br/>
 willing to ask and answer some really difficult questions (and get <br/>
 answers you may not be comfortable with!).<br/>
 <br/>
 But no one is making you. No one.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1985412427">&lt;I really don&#39;t want to be rude but I still have so many uestions.  <br/>
My head is spinning.  So if this question was asked in past few days <br/>
sorry.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No need to apologize.  This list is for unschooling question <br/>
asking.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;My 11 and 7 have always gone to public school.  I really hate the <br/>
thought of them  going back to school. I want to make sure it <br/>
wouldn&#39;t to much of a shock for them.  Because they are so used to <br/>
being structured and everything being timed. What kind of adjustment <br/>
periods do I need to know about?&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I believe the general guideline is one month for each year spent in <br/>
structured &quot;learning&quot;, correct me if I&#39;m wrong here...anyone.  <br/>
Again, this is just a guideline.  Some individuals may need more, <br/>
some less.  Also, don&#39;t forget to give yourself plenty of time.  It <br/>
helps to talk with your children about what you are doing.  Then, <br/>
turn your focus on your interests.  Don&#39;t get caught up in worrying <br/>
about what they are or are not doing.  Learn to see everything as <br/>
having value.  Join them in their pursuits.  Be present.  It is <br/>
really the best thing you could do.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;I probably sound very scattered brained, well that because I am.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t sound scatter brained at all.  Your questions are very <br/>
concise.  The more you read, ask questions, spend time with your <br/>
children, explore your interests the more you will gain confidence <br/>
in what you are doing.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;Also do your conferences ever make it out to Michigan?&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Jen, I live in Michigan, too.  I&#39;ve never heard of an unschooling <br/>
conference here.  We do have a homeschooling conference in Grand <br/>
Rapids each January.  There was also the conference that was held in <br/>
the east.  Sorry, the name eludes me right now.  Someone else can <br/>
tell you the name, I&#39;m sure.  It was a lot closer than traveling to <br/>
the other conference that&#39;s coming up, but that one already <br/>
happened.  I&#39;m not sure if it will be held next year as well.  I <br/>
sure hope so, as I would love to attend.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;Thanks for allowing in your group.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You are very welcome here.  Glad to have another Michigander poking <br/>
around.  :-)  What part of Michigan are you in?  I live in Roseville <br/>
in SE Michigan.<br/>

to do when they don&#39;t feel like they are &quot;supposed to&quot; be learning.  <br/>
Find ways to add to, support, expand on what they choose to do while  <br/>
on &quot;vacation.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
For example, if they play video games a lot, go to videogame stores,  <br/>
read videogame magazines and websites, play with them and let them  <br/>
explain all the specifics and nuances to you. Invite friends over to  <br/>
play - hook up machines to each other - help the kids learn to play  <br/>
online games and on and on.<br/>
<br/>
If they like to skateboard, go to skate parks - travel around and  <br/>
visit skate parks in different locales - heck, have a skateboard park  <br/>
vacation, subscribe to skating magazines, go to tournaments and  <br/>
demonstrations, hang out at skate stores and talk to the guys about  <br/>
wheels, build ramps.<br/>
<br/>
And so on....<br/>
<br/>
Plus - offer other stuff that you think they might enjoy - visit  <br/>
theme parks, living history sites, museums, concerts, etc. -- but  <br/>
don&#39;t insist on anything - just enjoy it and, if kids are NOT  <br/>
enjoying it, don&#39;t keep on.<br/>

    I may be changing the subject. I am sorry but I had so many post I <br/>
couldn&#39;t keep<br/>
up. I only read about half. I was wondering if we could maybe get back <br/>
to<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
--=-=-=-<br/>

JOYFULLY!<br/>

<br/>
 I really don&#39;t want to be rude but I still have so many<br/>
questions.My head is spinning.So if this question was asked in past few <br/>
days<br/>
sorry. Like I said I had a hard time keeping up. My 11 and 7 have <br/>
always gone to<br/>
public school.  I really hate the thought of them  going back to <br/>
school. I want<br/>
to make sure it wouldn&#39;t to much of a shock for them.Because they are <br/>
so used to<br/>
being structured and everything being timed. What kind of adjustment <br/>
periods do<br/>
I need to know about?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=--<br/>
<br/>
The rule of thumb is one month of deschooling for each year they (and <br/>
*you*) were in school.<br/>
<br/>
But the best thing you can do---especially since it&#39;s summer, is to <br/>
just keep having summer vacation. Don&#39;t quit in September. Have fun <br/>
with your passions. Immerse yourselves in them. If you&#39;re having too <br/>
much fun, GOOD!<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, if the kids seem dazed and out of it, they *still* <br/>
need to deschool. It may not look the same as days full of fun and <br/>
passions. If school really took a lot out of them, they may be listless <br/>
and unwillling to try anything new. They need to heal. Ease them out <br/>
with things like at-home movie days when you watch 3-4 movies and order <br/>
pizza out and just enjoy each other. Take them out to eat---new <br/>
restaurants, ethnic restaurants. Play with your food! Well, maybe not <br/>
in the restaurants &lt;g&gt;, but at home. (There&#39;s a great book called &quot;Play <br/>
with Your Food---check it out!)<br/>
<br/>
Offer things you  think they might like---but be prepared for and <br/>
accept &quot;no&quot; as an answer. They may not be ready yet.<br/>
<br/>
Patience. Trust. Respect.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Also do your conferences ever make it out to Michigan?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Sorry, no.<br/>
<br/>
But if you&#39;d like to host one there yourself, I&#39;ll be happy to help!<br/>

I hope they do have another conference here in Michigan.I wouldn&#39;t mind doing A conference. I just don&#39;t know enough about it this yet. I live in Chesaning.We live right in middle of Flint and Lansing. I hope you don&#39;t mind sharing your wisdom. I will be asking a lot of questions.This started with my 4 year old not being ready for K. Now I may try to keep my older two home. My 11 is in middle school all ready. Middle school starts in the 5Th grade. It&#39;s bull, these kids are to young. He is the one I worry about. He is at that age were he can be real nasty. He may not adjust so easily. My daughter will do great. Than I have the two little ones 4 and 2. They will do just fine. Thanks so much<br/>

 My head is spinning.  So if this question was asked in past few days <br/>
 sorry.&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
 No need to apologize.  This list is for unschooling question <br/>
 asking.  :-)<br/>
 <br/>
 &lt;My 11 and 7 have always gone to public school.  I really hate the <br/>
 thought of them  going back to school. I want to make sure it <br/>
 wouldn&#39;t to much of a shock for them.  Because they are so used to <br/>
 being structured and everything being timed. What kind of adjustment <br/>
 periods do I need to know about?&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
 I believe the general guideline is one month for each year spent in <br/>
 structured &quot;learning&quot;, correct me if I&#39;m wrong here...anyone.  <br/>
 Again, this is just a guideline.  Some individuals may need more, <br/>
 some less.  Also, don&#39;t forget to give yourself plenty of time.  It <br/>
 helps to talk with your children about what you are doing.  Then, <br/>
 turn your focus on your interests.  Don&#39;t get caught up in worrying <br/>
 about what they are or are not doing.  Learn to see everything as <br/>
 having value.  Join them in their pursuits.  Be present.  It is <br/>
 really the best thing you could do.<br/>
 <br/>
 &lt;I probably sound very scattered brained, well that because I am.&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
 You don&#39;t sound scatter brained at all.  Your questions are very <br/>
 concise.  The more you read, ask questions, spend time with your <br/>
 children, explore your interests the more you will gain confidence <br/>
 in what you are doing.<br/>
 <br/>
 &lt;Also do your conferences ever make it out to Michigan?&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
 Jen, I live in Michigan, too.  I&#39;ve never heard of an unschooling <br/>
 conference here.  We do have a homeschooling conference in Grand <br/>
 Rapids each January.  There was also the conference that was held in <br/>
 the east.  Sorry, the name eludes me right now.  Someone else can <br/>
 tell you the name, I&#39;m sure.  It was a lot closer than traveling to <br/>
 the other conference that&#39;s coming up, but that one already <br/>
 happened.  I&#39;m not sure if it will be held next year as well.  I <br/>
 sure hope so, as I would love to attend.<br/>
 <br/>
 &lt;Thanks for allowing in your group.&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
 You are very welcome here.  Glad to have another Michigander poking <br/>
 around.  :-)  What part of Michigan are you in?  I live in Roseville <br/>
 in SE Michigan.<br/>
 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1235348618">Hey Jen - there isn&#39;t &quot;an age&quot; where it is normal for kids to be  <br/>
&quot;real nasty.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So - the fact that you used that description tells me that you&#39;d be  <br/>
doing him a HUGE service to get him out of school and deschooling and  <br/>
relaxing and feeling secure and not constantly being controlled.<br/>

<br/>
All I can think is, &quot;WOW!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As far as your unschooling journey goes and decision making process is <br/>
concerned just keep asking questions.  Keep reading.  Immerse yourself <br/>
as far as you can.  <br/>
<br/>
I can totally relate to your situation.  Our oldest four graduated <br/>
from public school.  We pulled the three youngers out at various <br/>
stages.  It really is an individual decision for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Knowledge fueled by desire is power...<br/>
