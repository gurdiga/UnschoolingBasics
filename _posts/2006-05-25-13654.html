<div id="ygrps-yiv-1814123859">I have a 2.5 yo, just turned.  Not long after she turned 2 I joined this<br/>
group.  After I first joined I responded to someone&#39;s comment with support<br/>
saying I did the same thing regarding some issues.  Boy did I get an<br/>
&quot;eye&quot;ful.  Since then, I&#39;ve taken a good look at my issues with controlling<br/>
my dd food, and have given her much more freedom than I ever thought I<br/>
would.  Last week we went grocery shopping to buy chocolate chips and carob<br/>
chips.  DD spent the entire hour at the store munching on Carob chips, which<br/>
she sometimes would refer to as chocolate even though she knows the<br/>
difference.  In the last week she has had nothing but Carob chips for<br/>
breakfast 3 times, including this morning.  I&#39;m still working on shedding<br/>
negative feelings so I just remind myself that carob chips are high in<br/>
calcium and she&#39;s not eating any worse than yogurt or any other high calcium<br/>
snack.  Yesterday morning she asked for cookies for breakfast.  DH was home<br/>
and initially told her that wasn&#39;t a very good breakfast, but after I told<br/>
him that actually they (the brand of cookies we buy that she eats) had about<br/>
the same if not less sugar, and was fortified with more vitamins/minerals<br/>
than some of the cereal she eats he was all for it.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, what I was actually intending in this post was to say, like whomever<br/>
mentioned the &quot;junk&quot; issue... I try and keep only foods I wouldn&#39;t mind her<br/>
eating in our house.  Of course I don&#39;t have any other kids, except for dh,<br/>
but we don&#39;t have candy or sodas in our house so she doesn&#39;t ask for them.<br/>
I&#39;ve even noticed that on the rare occasion that we have something less<br/>
nutritious than what I&#39;d ideally like to see her eating when she asked for<br/>
something she only takes about 2 bites then she decides she&#39;d like something<br/>
else.   She too loves popsicles, but we make them together using fruit<br/>
that&#39;s getting to ripe.  We just pop watermelon or honeydew, oranges,<br/>
blueberries whatever in the food processor and pour them into popsicle<br/>
molds.  We all enjoy eating them in the hot afternoon.  We do the same to<br/>
make frozen ice cream type treat, we just add frozen sliced bananas each<br/>
time to make it creamy.  Hope these ideas help.<br/>

Thanks Misty, those ideas do help.<br/>
For me though the *control* of just not buying those items is out of the<br/>
question.  I have 2 teenagers AND dh who all go to the store independently<br/>
and buy what they want.  Dh will make a special trip to the store because I<br/>
don&#39;t even go down the chip and soda aisle simply because I don&#39;t care for<br/>
chips or soda.  Everyone else in the house loves chips and soda.  I don&#39;t<br/>
mind that they get them, it&#39;s just that I really don&#39;t think to get those<br/>
things because they aren&#39;t part of *my* shopping trip.  Now the chocolate<br/>
aisle is a totally different story.<br/>
. .......now that I&#39;m actually reading my reply I feel like a heel.  If I<br/>
counted on dh to do the shopping and he NEVER brought home some of my<br/>
favorite items (chocolate) I&#39;d be....well.....to put it bluntly....pissed.<br/>
Maybe I haven&#39;t been very considerate in this area.<br/>

~sigh, who will be consciously making a trip down the chip and soda aisle<br/>
this week.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you do the family shopping (the staples, eggs, milk, butter, flour, meat<br/>
(if you do meat) veggies, etc.) then chips and sodas should be on your list<br/>
since it is something that the rest of your family consumes.  :)<br/>
<br/>
 Now the chocolate<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; aisle is a totally different story.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You have a store with a chocolate aisle?  I am SO moving there.  :)<br/>
Actually, at my HFS there is a self of chocolate.  I&#39;m sure that there is<br/>
other stuff on the shelves below the chocolate, but I have no clue as to<br/>
what is there.  It runs all along the aisle at my eye level.  LOL!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There you go.  Self discovery!  I had one of those moments.  I periodically<br/>
buy &quot;therapy&quot; (Ben and Jerry&#39;s ice cream - cheaper and yummier than a real<br/>
therapist and all I need after a frantic week).  One day the kids asked if<br/>
they could have some.  I said, &quot;That&#39;s my therapy.&quot;  IOW &quot;MY special<br/>
treat.&quot;  My oldest child said to me, &quot;Mom, aren&#39;t we worth special treats<br/>
too?&quot;  Hmmmm.  They have a point.  So now I buy either two things of B&J&#39;s<br/>
or I buy a half gallon of something we will all enjoy.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You might be surprised that they also have other things down the chips<br/>
aisles.  I love pretzels but could care less about chips.  I&#39;ve also found<br/>
interesting &quot;chips&quot; like baked sugar snap peas, beet and sweet potato chips,<br/>
and dehydrated veggies down the chips aisle.<br/>
