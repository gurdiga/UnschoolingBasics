<div id="ygrps-yiv-1085969251">Sadie  (my almost 7 year old ) loves math which is always surprising to me because me and dh hate it:)<br/>
She also just loves to spend time with us so we play tic tac toe with different problems in the squares, some harder than others and give her an allowance and let her spend it. She plays with one of those leap frog math things my in laws gave her and she has a couple little workbooks that she loves. <br/>
A lot of un unschooly suggestions but this is my daughter and these are the ways she choses to learn about the way math works in her world.<br/>
Also talking to her a lot! She is always asking me questions about math.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It helps loads to not see math as something alien that needs learned  <br/>
but as a tool that is used while living life.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t need to unschool math any more than you need to unschool  <br/>
the English language.<br/>
<br/>
I think the biggest problem, though, is that schools spend so much  <br/>
time doing math that it seems like the little bit that kids do in  <br/>
real life can&#39;t possibly be enough.<br/>
<br/>
The reason schools spend so much time is because they go about it  <br/>
backwards and it&#39;s hard. They begin with the abstract and hope the  <br/>
kids will extract the meaning from it. Abstract is *hard* when you  <br/>
don&#39;t have a good feeling for what it is. Unfortunately, since  <br/>
schools need to show that kids are learning, they have to teach in a  <br/>
way that&#39;s testable. You can&#39;t test concepts that are being absorbed  <br/>
in odd ways and refined as they&#39;re being used. Imagine trying to  <br/>
devise a standardized test for 2 year olds to measure their progress  <br/>
in English. My daughter could say pachycephalosaurus before she could  <br/>
say her own name! There isn&#39;t a test in the world that would have  <br/>
given a good picture of her unique progress through mastering  <br/>
English ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Learning math is as easy as learning a native language. Kids absorb  <br/>
and refine the concepts because they  use them.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter uses math for shopping, tips, video games, art software,  <br/>
&quot;How long until ...&quot;, board and card games, Undoubtedly much more but  <br/>
those are the ones she encountered most often.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1140940354">~~You don&#39;t need to unschool math any more than you need to unschool<br/>

<br/>
Exactly.<br/>
Seeing the world in subjects is an impediment to joyful unschooling.<br/>
When math and history and science and everything else schools try to<br/>
divide, are simply part and parcel of pursuing passions (yeah, I&#39;m<br/>
having fun with that one today), then subjects become irrelevant. The<br/>
interest and fascination humans have with different topics and<br/>
information will involve math, as we follow those interests.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t need to worry about getting math into our children. We need<br/>
to focus on living a rich and full life. <br/>
<br/>
It IS good to be aware if we ourselves have hangups and damage about<br/>
math (or anything else) so we don&#39;t automatically shun things that are<br/>
related to it. I found that as I healed old school wounds, I saw math<br/>
in a totally different light. Math is everywhere. It&#39;s in art, music<br/>
and daily life. It can&#39;t be avoided. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-607608995">This is something I prepared for another list, but it might be useful<br/>
here. These resources are more for teens than younger ages (with a focus<br/>
on algebra, trigonometry, and higher math). They are mostly software<br/>
tools, but I also mention some videos, web sites, and competitions.<br/>
Mastering any of these software tools would provide quite a mathematical<br/>
education in an homeschooling sort of way -- if the child wanted to do that.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a link to a discussion about &quot;Open Source Math Software For<br/>
Education&quot;:<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/12/13/2355258">http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/12/13/2355258</a><br/>
It discusses computer software tools which does mathematical things.<br/>
In general, these sorts of tools can be wonderful playthings if you<br/>
and/or your child have the time and inclination to wrestle with them.<br/>
<br/>
Another summary link:<br/>
  &quot;Software for Mathematics Education&quot;<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://math.tkk.fi/~arasila/mathedu.html">http://math.tkk.fi/~arasila/mathedu.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Here is another link to a discussion of three big free software packages:<br/>
   <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://math-blog.com/2007/06/02/3-awesome-free-math-programs/">http://math-blog.com/2007/06/02/3-awesome-free-math-programs/</a><br/>
<br/>
The big three mentioned there are:<br/>
<br/>
  Scilab<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.scilab.org/">http://www.scilab.org/</a><br/>
&quot;Scilab is a scientific software package for numerical computations<br/>
providing a powerful open computing environment for engineering and<br/>
scientific applications.&quot;<br/>
See also the related Scicos:<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.scicos.org/">http://www.scicos.org/</a><br/>
&quot;Scicos is a graphical dynamical system modeler and simulator toolbox<br/>
included in the  Scilab ®  engineering and scientific computation<br/>
software. With Scicos you can create block diagrams to model and<br/>
simulate the dynamics of hybrid dynamical systems and compile your<br/>
models into executable code. Scicos is used for signal processing,<br/>
systems control, queuing systems, and to study physical and biological<br/>
systems. New extensions allow generation of component based modeling of<br/>
electrical and hydraulic circuits using  the Modelica language.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  Maxima<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://maxima.sourceforge.net/">http://maxima.sourceforge.net/</a><br/>
&quot;Maxima is a system for the manipulation of symbolic and numerical<br/>
expressions, including differentiation, integration, Taylor series,<br/>
Laplace transforms, ordinary differential equations, systems of linear<br/>
equations, polynomials, and sets, lists, vectors, matrices, and tensors.<br/>
Maxima yields high precision numeric results by using exact fractions,<br/>
arbitrary precision integers, and arbitrarily precision floating point<br/>
numbers. Maxima can plot functions and data in two and three dimensions.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  R<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.r-project.org/">http://www.r-project.org/</a><br/>
&quot;R is a free software environment for statistical computing and<br/>
graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms,<br/>
Windows and MacOS.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Here is another free package discussed at the first link:<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/">http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/</a><br/>
&quot;GNU Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical<br/>
computations. It provides a convenient command line interface for<br/>
solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing<br/>
other numerical experiments using a language that is mostly compatible<br/>
with Matlab.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Here is another (simpler) free package for statistics and plotting:<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.gnuplot.info/">http://www.gnuplot.info/</a><br/>
&quot;Gnuplot  is a portable command-line driven interactive data and<br/>
function plotting utility for UNIX, IBM OS/2, MS Windows, DOS,<br/>
Macintosh, VMS, Atari and many other platforms. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
However, to get a lot out of any of them, you have to put some time into<br/>
them and probably consult additional reference materials in their<br/>
tutorial manuals, on the web, and/or in related textbooks. Also, these<br/>
tools are all are a matter of convenience -- a general purpose<br/>
programming tool with some good libraries (e.g. Python + SciPy)<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.scipy.org/">http://www.scipy.org/</a><br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.scipy.org/Topical_Software">http://www.scipy.org/Topical_Software</a><br/>
can let you do pretty much anything these specialized packages do and in<br/>
a much more expandable way -- it just takes *much* more time and<br/>
understanding to work with the general tools (though you learn a lot<br/>
doing that). I&#39;d suggest perhaps doing both -- play with the tools *and*<br/>
try to learn how to program with various packages. :-)<br/>
<br/>
As you can see from especially the third link above, there are several<br/>
other tools. I&#39;m not sure how well all of these run under other<br/>
operating systems (most probably do run under Windows, but my wife and I<br/>
don&#39;t use that ourselves anymore except under emulation on the Mac or<br/>
Linux). You can probably find most of theses tools included (or easily<br/>
loadable) in Ubuntu (a version of GNU/Linux), which is available for<br/>
free here (you can download and burn a bootable CD to run these when you<br/>
want by rebooting, even if you run Windows):<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">http://www.ubuntu.com/</a><br/>
and they also mail out free CDs (but it may take some time -- see the<br/>
links on that page). There is also an &quot;Edubuntu&quot; educational variant,<br/>
but it seems more targeted at schools and I haven&#39;t tried it.<br/>
Instructions for loading some of these packages into Ubuntu:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?s=c8e173f81d97693ff7bb02ad5cefba0a&t=402802&highlight=Mathematical+software">http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?s=c8e173f81d97693ff7bb02ad5cefba0a&t=402802&highlight=Mathematical+software</a><br/>
<br/>
Any one of these packages is a project to get to know and understand. It<br/>
might takes quite a while to get a feel for them. But I think mastering<br/>
any of these packages will have a lot of practical value -- more so than<br/>
doing some paper exercises.<br/>
<br/>
While our child is only three (and so I haven&#39;t tried to use these<br/>
packages to teach him math; I&#39;m still focusing on John Holt&#39;s ideas of<br/>
seeing how small numbers like nine can be broken down and assembled many<br/>
ways), I have been involved tangentially with some people doing<br/>
mathematical education using computer software for more advanced math,<br/>
primarily using the programming language Python.<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.python.org/">http://www.python.org/</a><br/>
There is a newer way of thinking about math and physics which suggests<br/>
thinking about that as just a subpart of computer programming, rather<br/>
than a more classical school subject approach which often puts computer<br/>
programming as an add-on under math & physics. :-) Essentially, by<br/>
developing programs and simulations of interest to a child, a child<br/>
learns more and more about basic principles of mathematics they need to<br/>
solve problems of interest to them, as well as to develop a certain type<br/>
of mathematical thinking skills related to precision and causality and<br/>
symbol manipulation and so on. Learning to program then becomes the<br/>
stepping stone to learning about math and physics.<br/>
<br/>
For example, a child can learn a lot about trigonometry by just playing<br/>
around with a 2D or 3D turtle:<br/>
  &quot;turtle -- Turtle graphics for Tk using Python&quot;<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-turtle.html">http://docs.python.org/lib/module-turtle.html</a><br/>
However they typically need to learn a little programming first (like<br/>
how to write a loop). Consider, for example, this college assignment:<br/>
  &quot;Mandelbrot, Turtle Graphics and L-Systems in Python&quot;<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/Courses/comp144-s02/assignments/2/index.html">http://www.cs.unc.edu/Courses/comp144-s02/assignments/2/index.html</a><br/>
I would think those sorts of experiments could keep a high schooler busy<br/>
for quite a while, while also learning about angles and distances and<br/>
mathematical reasoning (while they debug their graphical programs); but<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t try those as a first step for someone who did not already<br/>
know programming. Here is a simple code snippet for someone wanting to<br/>
learn some simple programming and turtle graphics with Python:<br/>
  &quot;Turtle Graphics (Python)&quot;<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.daniweb.com/code/snippet304.html">http://www.daniweb.com/code/snippet304.html</a><br/>
Modify that to draw a few geometric shapes (cubes, octagons,<br/>
parallelograms, etc.) and it&#39;s a start down the path of 2D geometry. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Here is a bigger set of links (mostly programs) related to<br/>
Python+Geometry for homeschoolers<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/pygeom.html">http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/pygeom.html</a><br/>
In general the author of that site has a lot to say about the<br/>
intersection of computing and mathematics.<br/>
<br/>
To get more advanced in 3D geometry, here is a free package by the late<br/>
Arthur Siegel to do interactive 3D geometry in Python:<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://pygeo.sourceforge.net/">http://pygeo.sourceforge.net/</a><br/>
&quot;PyGeo is most fundamentally a framework for the creation of dynamic<br/>
geometric constructions - i.e. constructions which embody defined and<br/>
persistent geometric relationships responsive to real time on-screen<br/>
interactivity. PyGeo is, further, an implementation of this underlying<br/>
abstract framework - exposing a range of geometric objects as the<br/>
building blocks for virtual, dynamic geometric constructions. The focus<br/>
is away from Euclidian geometry and metrics, and toward later geometric<br/>
and mathematical developments - particularly those connected with<br/>
projective geometry of real space, and the geometry of complex numbers<br/>
on the plane and on the unit (Riemann) sphere.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Nothing about school-style trigonometry &quot;proofs&quot; there though -- except<br/>
the ones you build for yourself in passing to debug things. Here&#39;s lots<br/>
of links related to logic software and logic education if you want to<br/>
focus on proofs (includes some links to theorem provers):<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/staffpriv/hans/logiccourseware.html">http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/staffpriv/hans/logiccourseware.html</a><br/>
But I would think this a dustier and drier route for most kids to get an<br/>
intuition for geometrical things than indirectly via programming.<br/>
<br/>
Some fraction of the population has trouble visualizing or<br/>
rotating things in 2D or 3D,<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_Visualization_Ability">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_Visualization_Ability</a><br/>
so some kids find geometry much easier than others. I think 3D spatial<br/>
visualization tools may help narrow that gap, especially tools which can<br/>
make the 3d object rotate (at least slightly). Related exercises:<br/>
&quot;Spatial Encounters: Exercises in Spatial Awareness.&quot;<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.womentechstore.com/edpw031-spatial-encounters-introduction.html">http://www.womentechstore.com/edpw031-spatial-encounters-introduction.html</a><br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED236183&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&accno=ED236183">http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED236183&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&accno=ED236183</a><br/>
Likewise some kids almost need to visualize things to feel they<br/>
understand them as opposed to accept purely symbolic representations;<br/>
there are various approaches to mathematics that are more highly visual<br/>
than others. Example:<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ms.uky.edu/~lee/visual05/visual05.html">http://www.ms.uky.edu/~lee/visual05/visual05.html</a><br/>
If there is one issue that may make or break in some advanced math<br/>
studies, it is an ability to visualize. If the kid in question isn&#39;t<br/>
good at that, it may help more to focus early on visualization skills<br/>
(including blueprint reading) than to move ahead to more advanced topics.<br/>
<br/>
Here is another programming language system Squeak (Smalltalk) which has<br/>
various educational tools in it like turtles:<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.squeak.org/Features/">http://www.squeak.org/Features/</a><br/>
It has a steeper learning curve than Python though.<br/>
<br/>
In my own life I&#39;ve found the only major use for trigonometry was<br/>
writing 3D graphics software. :-) Here is a example of such software<br/>
(available for free) which my wife and I wrote:<br/>
 <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.kurtz-fernhout.com/PlantStudio/index.htm">http://www.kurtz-fernhout.com/PlantStudio/index.htm</a><br/>
&quot;PlantStudio Botanical Illustration Software is a tool for creating 3D<br/>
plant models and 2D illustrations. PlantStudio simulates herbaceous<br/>
(non-woody) plants like wildflowers and cut flowers, vegetables, weeds,<br/>
grasses, and herbs using a parameter-driven simulation of plant growth<br/>
and structure. You can &quot;grow&quot; plants over their life cycles, producing<br/>
lifelike images at any age. You can design, animate and breed a wide<br/>
variety of plants. By using the &quot;evolutionary arts&quot; of variation and<br/>
selection in the plant breeder, you can quickly and easily create whole<br/>
families of unique plants for your 3D scenes.&quot;<br/>
There&#39;s a lot of stuff in there about angles and rotations and so on --<br/>
can&#39;t help but learn a little about trigonometry (and botany) even by<br/>
just playing with it.<br/>
<br/>
While I know schools tend to focus on a chain of algebra, trigonometry,<br/>
calculus, (especially for kids interested in engineering) I&#39;d suggest<br/>
learning about probability and statistics (done as part of developing a<br/>
computer simulation) would generally be a more useful mathematical skill<br/>
in the real world for most people, since we all need to make decisions<br/>
every day related to risks and also trying to read between the lines of<br/>
newspaper articles and advertisements throwing statistics around in an<br/>
attempt to inform or persuade us.<br/>
<br/>
For example, here is a fun link about how to lie with statistics:<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/stat3.html">http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/stat3.html</a><br/>
&quot;Ok...this is what you have been waiting for. How can you lie with<br/>
statistics? Actually, the purpose of this page is NOT to teach you how<br/>
to lie and cheat with statistics. Rather, I hope you will learn how it<br/>
is possible to be misled and how to spot &quot;statistical abuse.&quot; You can<br/>
find poor use of statistics everywhere...magazines, newspapers, polls,<br/>
TV, even research papers. I do not want to hear of any of you readers<br/>
using these poor methods.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And here is a book on that topic:<br/>
  _How to Lie With Statistics_<br/>

<br/>
There are also a variety of free instructional videos available over the<br/>
web as part of the Annenberg CPB project if you have a fast internet<br/>
connection (and otherwise likely available from a local library or<br/>
through interlibrary loan):<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.learner.org/resources/browse.html">http://www.learner.org/resources/browse.html</a><br/>
Exmaples:<br/>
&quot;Against All Odds: Inside Statistics; This video instructional series<br/>
for college and high school classrooms and adult learners leads to a<br/>
greater understanding of statistics by exploring authentic examples —<br/>
from environmental studies to weight-loss programs.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Algebra: In Simplest Terms; This video instructional series for college<br/>
and high school classrooms and adult learners guides students<br/>
step-by-step through algebra concepts, while highlighting common trouble<br/>
spots.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Learning Math: Geometry; Learn the basics of geometry in this video-<br/>
and Web-based course for K-8 teachers.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t watched any of those, but many years ago I did go through the<br/>
entire Mechanical Universe physics series for myself and liked it:<br/>
 &quot;The Mechanical Universe…and Beyond; This video instructional series<br/>
for college and high school classrooms and adult learners demystifies<br/>
physics and illustrates abstract concepts.&quot;<br/>
(Physics ends up being mostly math at more advanced stages.)<br/>
I also enjoyed their World of Chemistry, but I didn&#39;t see that is<br/>
online. There is also an accompanying textbook to the Mechanical<br/>
Universe; if anyone wanted something like a curriculum, that might<br/>
be a way to go which integrates mathematics into a physical setting that<br/>
helps motivate its study -- but you can also just watch the videos<br/>
for fun.<br/>
<br/>
Here is another general resource for math education:<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://mathforum.org/">http://mathforum.org/</a><br/>
&quot;The Math Forum is the leading online resource for improving math<br/>
learning, teaching, and communication since 1992.<br/>
_We are teachers, mathematicians, researchers, students, and parents<br/>
using the power of the Web to learn math and improve math education.<br/>
_We offer a wealth of problems and puzzles; online mentoring; research;<br/>
team problem solving; collaborations; and professional development.<br/>
Students have fun and learn a lot. Educators share ideas and acquire new<br/>
skills.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If your kid is a general theoretical math whiz<br/>
there is quite a bit of money to be won solving these incredible<br/>
difficult puzzles:<br/>
 <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.claymath.org/millennium/">http://www.claymath.org/millennium/</a><br/>
&quot;In order to celebrate mathematics in the new millennium, The Clay<br/>
Mathematics Institute of Cambridge, Massachusetts (CMI) has named seven<br/>
 Prize Problems. The Scientific Advisory Board of CMI selected these<br/>
problems, focusing on important classic questions that have resisted<br/>
solution over the years. The Board of Directors of CMI designated a $7<br/>
million prize fund for the solution to these problems, with $1 million<br/>
allocated to each.&quot;<br/>
It may even be fun just to look at the puzzles and think about what you<br/>
would need to know to even think about solving them. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Here is a step down :-) -- the local William Lowell Putnam competition:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lowell_Putnam_Mathematical_Competition">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lowell_Putnam_Mathematical_Competition</a><br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://math.scu.edu/putnam/">http://math.scu.edu/putnam/</a><br/>
&quot;Each year the annual Putnam Competition is held on the first Saturday<br/>
in December. ... The competition is open only to regularly enrolled<br/>
undergraduates, in colleges and universities of the United States and<br/>
Canada, who have not yet received a college degree. No individual may<br/>
participate in the competition more than four times. An eligible entrant<br/>
who is also a high school student must be informed of this four time limit.&quot;<br/>
Not much money even if you win the competition, but<br/>
perhaps a bit of glory. And something motivating for some -- to do well<br/>
in that contest. (Well, it helps that math departments sometimes pay for<br/>
a free lunch for the contestants. :-) Although ultimately the best<br/>
motivation comes from within for the love of the subject for itself.<br/>
Perhaps a competition might even be off-putting for some.<br/>
Anyway, even if you don&#39;t want to do the competition, the support<br/>
materials and sample questions may be of interest.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a John Holt fan. Here is one thing he says about math:<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.naturalchild.org/guest/marlene_bumgarner.html">http://www.naturalchild.org/guest/marlene_bumgarner.html</a><br/>
<br/>
&quot;What your philosophy about math?<br/>
<br/>
...<br/>
<br/>
The best way to meet numbers is in real life, as everything else. It’s<br/>
embedded in the context of reality, and what schooling does is to try to<br/>
take everything out of the context of reality. So everything appears<br/>
like some little thing floating around in space, and it’s a terrible<br/>
mistake. You know, there are numbers in building; there are numbers in<br/>
construction; there are numbers in business; there are numbers in<br/>
photography; there are numbers in music; there are fractions in cooking.<br/>
So wherever numbers are in real life, then let’s go and meet them and<br/>
work with them.<br/>
<br/>
What subject matter do you see as essential?<br/>
<br/>
None.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There is too much mathophobia in the world as it is -- in large part as<br/>
a consequence of how math is taught in schools:<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=mathophobia">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=mathophobia</a><br/>
Yet higher math can be a very fun endeavor if done for its own sake.<br/>
As much as I like mathematical ideas, there are a lot of very successful<br/>
people in life who cannot do math at all. If your kid has other<br/>
interests, then advanced math is about as important as advanced zoology<br/>
-- probably less so. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, plenty of open-ended free resources to play with and learn<br/>
something mathematical for kids or adults.<br/>

i am unschooling my daughter and i agree, units or subject study can be a bore. as far as <br/>
your child comprehending the concept of numbers. i suggest cooking together. isadora <br/>
loves using her own measuring cups (we found the best heart shaped cups and spoons at <br/>

<br/>
it is only natural that issy is curious about the numbers on the measuring spoons and <br/>
cups. we also do alot of gardening which develops a sense of counting and numbers. <br/>
i pretty much follow isadora&#39;s lead. we live on a farm so we tend to have many <br/>

it were. Why would someone who wasn&#39;t terribly visual be drawn to <br/>
this kind of advanced math in the first place? That could very well <br/>
play in to the &quot;make or break&quot; aspect.<br/>

go about learning things in general so we can help them find the <br/>
tools that work best for them. But again, if someone didn&#39;t have a <br/>
strong ability to visualize, and wasn&#39;t being pushed or &quot;encouraged&quot; <br/>
to study higher math, I find myself wondering why he or she would <br/>
want to do that? Maybe to further some other goal (like my stepson <br/>
with the programming) but that assumes there&#39;s only one route to a <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks for sharing your paradigm shifting thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
And I can agree you are right -- look at my implicit thinking in even<br/>
using the phrase &quot;to teach him math&quot; instead of, say, &quot;to help support<br/>
his desire to learn math&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Right now, at three, he is focused on issues like moving quantities of<br/>
sand and water around in various ways. And what you say makes sense; I<br/>
should respect that -- even if he is not too sure consistently on what<br/>
number word comes after three and has not much patience or interest in<br/>
games involving counting (like Chutes and Ladders). :-)<br/>
<br/>
Consider for example:<br/>
  &quot;What can children learn from water play?&quot;<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.communityplaythings.com/c/Resources/Articles/SandandWater/MakingtheMostofWaterPlay.htm">http://www.communityplaythings.com/c/Resources/Articles/SandandWater/MakingtheMostofWaterPlay.htm</a><br/>
&quot;Without the time and opportunity for lots of exploration, a child<br/>
formulates fewer meaningful concepts. While water play promotes<br/>
problem-solving and thinking skills in general, it is particularly well<br/>
suited to the development of concepts in mathematics and science.&quot;<br/>
Some concepts they list there learned in water play include:<br/>
&quot;empty/full	many/ few 	before/ after<br/>
thick/ thin	more/ less	same/ different<br/>
heavy/ light	shallow/ deep	greater/ less than<br/>
sets	classification 	rational counting<br/>
liquid measure       	ordinal counting       	linear measure&quot;.<br/>
<br/>

&quot;A study found that five-year-olds found it difficult to adapt to the<br/>
formal curriculum. The research, from the National Foundation for<br/>
Educational Research, concluded that the time spent sitting still should<br/>
be reduced. It said that children should have more access to<br/>
&quot;play-based&quot; learning. The study suggested that schools should &quot;allocate<br/>
resources to enable children to experience some play-based activities<br/>
that give access to opportunities such as sand and water, role play,<br/>
construction and outdoor learning&quot;.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

&quot;After studying 25,000 children across both state and private schools<br/>
Philip Adey, a professor of education at King’s College London<br/>
confidently declares: “The intelligence of 11-year-olds has fallen by<br/>
three years’ worth in the past two decades.” ... So why are children now<br/>
doing so badly? Possible explanations are numerous. Youngsters don’t get<br/>
outside for hands-on play in mud, sand and water — and sandpits and<br/>
water tables have been squeezed out in many primary schools by a<br/>
relentless drilling of the three Rs and cramming 11- year-olds for the<br/>
national tests. “By stressing the basics — reading and writing — and<br/>
testing like crazy you reduce the level of cognitive stimulation.<br/>
Children have the facts but they are not thinking very well,” says Adey.<br/>
“And they are not getting hands-on physical experience of the way<br/>
materials behave.” &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the reminder; hard to break old habits of schooling, even<br/>
when you are trying. :-(<br/>
<br/>
I do feel, especially in math, there is the issue of a kid not knowing<br/>
what he or she does not know -- that is why we often feel less smart as<br/>
we get older :-) as we learn more about our own ignorance, and why our<br/>
parents often suddenly seem much more intelligent after we have kids of<br/>
our own. :-) But that issue of &quot;unknown unknowns&quot; is more applicable to<br/>
older ages (perhaps teens) where dealing with abstraction becomes<br/>
important in pursuing advanced math.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; we get older <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Over the years I&#39;ve tutored math, and also taught quilting <br/>
workshops...and now have a teen stepson and I&#39;ve often found just <br/>
the opposite. Most people leave school with such a narrow idea of <br/>
what &quot;math&quot; is and *that* hampers their understanding. When I&#39;ve <br/>
been able to find ways to explain concepts that don&#39;t look or sound <br/>
like &quot;math&quot; I find many people have a deeper understanding than they <br/>
themselves realize - its not that they don&#39;t know what they don&#39;t <br/>
know, they don&#39;t know or value what they *do* know. <br/>
<br/>
I think the &quot;less smart&quot; feeling that some people have is a result <br/>
of having developed anxiety about learning. In quilting workshops <br/>
I&#39;ve seen (and experienced myself) the delight that comes over <br/>
people when they are learning something entirely new. The difference <br/>
is that these are people who are choosing to do something for the <br/>
enjoyment of it and learning as a result. That&#39;s a basic principle <br/>
of unschooling - that natural learning is enjoyable. <br/>
<br/>
Right now I&#39;m learning to juggle (just got some clubs, woooo hooo!). <br/>
There are definately times when I feel like I&#39;m all thumbs, or that <br/>
I&#39;m making infintessimal progress. But I don&#39;t feel &quot;less smart&quot; for <br/>
not knowing how to juggle. I *do* get a sense of anxiety around <br/>
certain jugglers, who have a very didactic way of talking to me <br/>
about juggling. Other jugglers I know are simply supportive - <br/>
they&#39;ll offer help if I seem like I need it, applaud my sucesses and <br/>
invite me to laugh at my goofs. I don&#39;t have any anxiety at all <br/>
about juggling in front of them. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that is why we often feel less smart as<br/>
&gt; we get older :-) as we learn more about our own ignorance<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m really glad you posted this, since its giving me a chance to <br/>
explore the idea. I think the folks I&#39;m describing as &quot;didactic&quot; are <br/>
making a point of telling me how ignorant I am. Not in a mean way. I <br/>
can tell these guys - its just two - are trying to be helpful, even <br/>
encouraging. But somehow it leads to me feeling worse about my <br/>
ability. <br/>
<br/>
The jugglers I know who are being supportive, but not didactic, <br/>
aren&#39;t any less skilled jugglers than these two guys - if anything, <br/>
they&#39;re better. Watching them, I can *see* all the things I can&#39;t do <br/>
yet, but I&#39;m left with a sense of &quot;hey, wow, can I do that, <br/>
someday?&quot; instead of &quot;I&#39;m a long way from there&quot;. <br/>

other things - one of the reasons I brought up juggling, although <br/>
its pretty easy to argue that juggling is math ;) Learning just <br/>
isn&#39;t segmented into clear categories. Individual tendencies, <br/>
development, past experiences, and the environment all interact and <br/>
overlap and swirl around. Knowing what I know about my own patterns <br/>
of learning is far more useful to *me* in getting over the first <br/>
stage of learning *anything* than any other skill or piece of <br/>
information. <br/>
