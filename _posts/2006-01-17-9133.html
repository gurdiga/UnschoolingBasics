<div id="ygrps-yiv-949239953">&quot;We flipped the regular way and then tested to see if it<br/>
changed much based on whether you started heads or tails. (It didn&#39;t.) &quot;<br/>
<br/>
We did the same thing...Jared was pretty sure that it would land on<br/>
the heads more if you started with tails and vice versa.<br/>
We ended up pretty close to even...5/5, 7/3, 5/5 and 6/4.<br/>
<br/>
Didn&#39;t prove a thing, but had a lot of fun. It was really windy here<br/>
today and Jared thought it was cool that on BF&#39;s birthday it was a<br/>
good kite day.:)<br/>
