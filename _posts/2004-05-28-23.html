<div id="ygrps-yiv-1118221541">Hi, I&#39;m Sarah. I live in Michigan with my dh of 13 years, Tracy. We <br/>
have three great kids who have never been to school, Connor(8) Kenyon<br/>
(5) and Molly(almost 2). I learned about homeschooling when Connor <br/>
was 2. I started reading everything I could on the various <br/>
homeschooling philosophies, and we have been mostly eclectic/relaxed <br/>
in our life/learning styles - with brief periods of structure as I <br/>
learn to let go of my &quot;Teacher Mom&quot; tendencies. Luckily Connor is <br/>
the only one who has ever had to deal with Teacher Mom, and since I <br/>
banished her a few months ago we&#39;re both recovering very nicely :o)<br/>
and calling ourselves &quot;unschoolers&quot; for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
Lately we&#39;ve been enjoying warm weather and watching the &quot;greening&quot; <br/>
of our property. We&#39;ve adopted a big fat toad and set him up in a <br/>
terrarium in the living room. The boys enjoy finding bugs for him to <br/>
eat. The boys are also hooked on playing Spyro on their GameBoys and <br/>
Zoombinis on our PC. Connor got a great word search book for his <br/>
birthday a few weeks ago so he&#39;s been having great fun with that <br/>
also. Kenyon is a digger-we have holes all over our yard. Muddy days <br/>
are especially fun around here. And Molly is very busy learning lots <br/>
of new words and also honing her motor skills as she circumvents all <br/>
of our &quot;toddler-proofing&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to talking and learning with everyone on the list!<br/>
~Sarah</div>
