<div id="ygrps-yiv-640799369">**I&#39;ve NEVER met a child that shows zero interest in some of the daily<br/>
<br/>
things around the house. A parent can turn off that interest fairly<br/>
<br/>
young though, by doing for the child or stopping them all the time. **<br/>
<br/>
I know several parents of very young children who lament that the kids want <br/>
to be right in there helping when they&#39;re folding laundry. <br/>
<br/>
Refold the laundry while your child is around to see it. That will turn them <br/>
right off to it pretty darn quick. Then act surprised and indignant when <br/>
they&#39;re 10 and show not the slightest interest in laundry. <br/>
