<div id="ygrps-yiv-980150157">&quot;I&#39;ve noticed a lot of &quot;my way or the highway&quot; attitudes among<br/>
unschoolers, actually.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sure. Someone can be unschooling and still instituting rules,<br/>
punishments etc... too.<br/>
<br/>
I think unschooling will blossom much better in an atmosphere of trust<br/>
and respect though. For me, trust means that my way isn&#39;t necessarily<br/>
the best choice for others. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah but that&#39;s exactly the question. Are unschoolers saying that  <br/>
they can ALWAYS trust their children to make the best choice, even if  <br/>
it means burning their skin, or imflaming the wound that was already  <br/>
healed, even happening again a second time although by then it should  <br/>
have learned, or being scared of whatever they saw in a movie at the  <br/>
age of 4 for the rest of their lives? For me &quot;isn&#39;t necessarily the  <br/>
best choice for others&quot; sounds like &quot;... but sometimes, it is, and  <br/>
THEN we are allowed/should enforce our will (to protect the child ?)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just unsure when to draw the line between trusting and  <br/>
protecting, and even for the protecting part I am not sure in which  <br/>
way a gentle parent would do it. I am sure you pull off your child  <br/>
from the street if she runs out there and cars are coming and so on,  <br/>
these very obvious and instant dangers I have of course no doubt that  <br/>
you just do it. But scary movies  and porn (mom, I want to have a TV  <br/>
in my room... (?)) or a stupid plaster of which you might even think,  <br/>
well it will probably not inflame and then it does! And then the  <br/>
second plaster it&#39;s the same story... and for the sun cream... ok,  <br/>
you find good ideas on how to deal with it in the future (x-box,  <br/>
midnight, long armed thingies), but what do you do that very first  <br/>
day it happens? Do you go home, let them whining because there just  <br/>
isn&#39;t any solution? Or what if none of the solutions are agreed upon  <br/>
by them, I can see this happen especially with children who are used  <br/>
to coercive methods and suddently become unschooled.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think a better way to say it is unschoolers trust their children.  <br/>
They trust that when a child says something is bothering him or that  <br/>
he doesn&#39;t want to do something or does want to do something that  <br/>
it&#39;s important to the child.<br/>
<br/>
If my husband came home and said he was unhappy at work and was  <br/>
thinking of taking some time off I wouldn&#39;t say &quot;No you&#39;re not,&quot; or  <br/>
&quot;That&#39;&#39;s stilly,&quot; or &quot;That&#39;s tough, you have to go to work.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And yet conventional parenting has parents saying similar things to  <br/>
children&#39;s expressions of what&#39;s bothering them all the time :-/<br/>
<br/>
So it isn&#39;t that we trust them to make the &quot;right&#39; decision. It&#39;s  <br/>
that we trust that they&#39;re trying to get their very real needs met.  <br/>
We trust that they *do* care about being safe and free from pain but  <br/>
that sometimes something gets in the way and we need to treat it  <br/>
seriously. And sometimes they need to put up with discomfort (like  <br/>
being grumpy after staying up all night) in order to experience  <br/>
something. So unschoolers think outside the box, trying to find  <br/>
solutions other than &quot;do whatever you want&quot; and &quot;you have to.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So one example was her son who<br/>
&gt; is 3, they were at the beach and he didn&#39;t want to neither use sun<br/>
&gt; blocking cream nor use a hat, and absolutely refused it no matter<br/>
&gt; what they explained (which they kindly did). Then they said they had<br/>
&gt; to go home � they went into the car, there he promised to use the<br/>
&gt; hat.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What she created was a power struggle. The only choice she gave him  <br/>
was to do what she wanted in the way she wanted it. There had to be a  <br/>
winner and a loser and she was determined she&#39;d be the winner.  <br/>
(Against a 3 yo :-/)<br/>
<br/>
If we become their partners then there are no power struggles. If we  <br/>
give up &quot;the one right solution&quot; and see ourselves as their partners,  <br/>
there&#39;s no reason for there to be winners and losers.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; even if<br/>
&gt; it means burning their skin  or imflaming the wound that was already<br/>
&gt; healed<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It also helps to look at what are real things to worry about an what  <br/>
are fears to indulge &quot;just in case.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The medical community has us so frightened of the sun that it seems  <br/>
like one case of sunburn and the child is doomed to skin cancer. But  <br/>
it&#39;s no more true than skipping brushing teeth.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s long term, life time habits that increase the risk of skin  <br/>
cancer (barring exceptionally fair skin and a history of skin cancer.)<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s helpful to step back when that need to pressure comes and ask  <br/>
&quot;Who&#39;s going to die if I let this happen?&quot; It&#39;s better to give  <br/>
information to help a child make decisions -- and if we&#39;ve been  <br/>
treating them with respect they trust that our information *is*  <br/>
intended to help and not code for &quot;do it my way or you&#39;ll be sorry&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I said that unschoolers don&#39;t expect their children to even want to<br/>
&gt; watch these kind of movies<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually some kids do. And some kids are fine with more than their  <br/>
age would suggest.<br/>
<br/>
But other kids are curious and want to test their limits. That&#39;s a  <br/>
good thing! We should always be checking and testing our limits  <br/>
because we&#39;re always growing and changing. So unschoolers would  <br/>
*help* the child watch a scary movie. We&#39;d get it on DVD so we could  <br/>
pause and talk, or skip over parts the child wanted to skip, stop it  <br/>
and watch it later (or never), look at and discuss Making Of  <br/>
documentaries that are on the DVD to see how effects were created,  <br/>
watch it during the morning. All sorts of ideas between &quot;whatever&#39;  <br/>
and &quot;no.&quot;!<br/>
<br/>
The point is to empower the child. We *don&#39;t* say &quot;Go, do whatever  <br/>
you want and find out the bad consequences that I&#39;m trying to tell  <br/>
you about in order to stop you from doing that foolishness.&quot; We  <br/>
essentially say &quot;Let&#39;s find a way to do this.&quot; Explore and try it out.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; she brought up a<br/>
&gt; hitchcock movie she saw when she was 6 (the birds or soemthing) and<br/>
&gt; how she was afraid of birds for her whole childhood and had<br/>
&gt; nightmares and so on)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Was she unschooled? Did she express her fears as she was watching and  <br/>
did her parents take those fears seriously? Did she feel empowered to  <br/>
say &quot;No, thanks.&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Conventional parenting *is* a lot of &quot;No&quot; and &quot;Whatever you want, I&#39;m  <br/>
busy.&quot; Not entirely but it characterizes a lot of it. Kids don&#39;t feel  <br/>
that their parents are their partners in their exploration.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Well, she said that NOW at 7 they wouldn&#39;t want to watch those things<br/>
&gt; but in a few years... she said just like an adult would still be<br/>
&gt; curious even if their husband/wife would tell them kindly not to<br/>
&gt; watch something because X, they would probably still want to watch<br/>
&gt; it, accepting the consequences which a child couldn&#39;t forsee.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There isn&#39;t a reason for a child to &quot;accept the consequences&quot; if the  <br/>
parent sees their relationship with the child as a being their  <br/>
partner in their explorations. I have warned my daughter about moving  <br/>
skeletons in movies (her fear). I have found (on http:// <br/>
www.screenit.com) detailed descriptions of when scary scenes are  <br/>
coming up so I can warn her if she wants to see a movie. If she wants  <br/>
to watch it, I help her. If she wants to watch it several years from  <br/>
now, I help her.<br/>
<br/>
Your friend is projecting the reactions of a conventionally parenting  <br/>
child onto an unschooling child. She is seeing the only way of  <br/>
raising children is to forbid them from doing things that will harm  <br/>
them and can&#39;t see how respectful parenting will achieve that. But  <br/>
the goal of respectful parenting isn&#39;t just a different way to  <br/>
getting the child to do what the parent wants, or stepping back and  <br/>
letting the child learn on his own. It&#39;s a partnership. It&#39;s helping  <br/>
the child.<br/>
<br/>
My husband would *not* say &quot;Don&#39;t watch that movie,&quot; and then expect  <br/>
me to trust his word and not watch it. He&#39;d tell me &quot;I don&#39;t think  <br/>
you&#39;d like it because of such and such,&quot; and would trust that I trust  <br/>
what he&#39;s saying is true and helpful. He&#39;d give me information. He&#39;d  <br/>
see the purpose as helping me find things I enjoy and avoid things I  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t enjoy. Just as I do with him. *In addition* to information,  <br/>
with a child, I&#39;d help them explore something they might have  <br/>
problems with. I&#39;d *trust* that they were discovering new things  <br/>
about themselves by exploring.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean they always &quot;learn&quot; what we want them to. A  <br/>
momentary pain of pulling off a plaster needs taken seriously and not  <br/>
dismissed. Letting the child &quot;find out for himself&quot; isn&#39;t respectful  <br/>
when he&#39;s making choices to avoid pain! Finding *other* ways to  <br/>
remove the plaster would be respectful.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; An<br/>
&gt; adult could handle the consequences (fear, nightmares) better, but<br/>
&gt; children couldn&#39;t and she said there have been research where they<br/>
&gt; showed children agressive movies and then someone would hit the<br/>
&gt; child, and those children who watched agressive movies reacted way<br/>
&gt; more agressive than the others who hadn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The studies really don&#39;t mean much.<br/>
<br/>
Were the children choosing the movies they wanted to watch when they  <br/>
wanted to watch them?<br/>
<br/>
Most kids *do* imitate what they&#39;ve seen. Does that mean they toss  <br/>
out the values of their family, turn their backs on being treated  <br/>
kindly and with respect, and adopt violent values from watching a  <br/>
movie? Not with unschooling families.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So her point was, it is<br/>
&gt; proven to be damaging if they watch such things.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sounds plausible in theory but it doesn&#39;t play out long term in real  <br/>
unschooling families where children&#39;s needs and wants are being  <br/>
treated with respect.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I said that I would be watching with her if she wanted to<br/>
&gt; watch something &quot;dangerous&quot;, she said that was quite time consuming<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Kids *are* time consuming! They aren&#39;t something to take out and play  <br/>
with when it&#39;s convenient for us and set aside when more important  <br/>
things come along.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and if would I sit next to her each time at each hour in the day<br/>
&gt; whenever she wants to watch something<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You wouldn&#39;t *need* to be there every hour. Goodness! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Some kids are really sensitive and they know it and their moms know  <br/>
it. Some are even bothered by Disney. They wouldn&#39;t be parking  <br/>
themselves in front of the TV with scary movies on!<br/>
<br/>
My daughter has  always had free rein of the TV. If something bothers  <br/>
her she changes the channel. She feels she&#39;s more powerful than the  <br/>
TV. If she *wants* to watch something she fears might bother her,  <br/>
she&#39;d ask for help because she trusts me to help her explore what  <br/>
interests her.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; would I be advising her each<br/>
&gt; time if she should be watching X or Y?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We trust that they can learn. We trust that they&#39;re intelligent. We  <br/>
don&#39;t trust that they&#39;ll get it right all the time. They&#39;ll make  <br/>
mistakes and that&#39;s okay because that&#39;s how humans learn.<br/>
<br/>
I do trust my daughter to try out a show and decide if she&#39;d like to  <br/>
continue or not. I do trust that she can see the difference pretty  <br/>
quickly between a cartoon for adolescents and a porno slasher film!  <br/>
There&#39;s no reason to tell her what to watch! TV shows are pretty much  <br/>
the same from week to week as far as level of violence and sex. It&#39;s  <br/>
really movies that they may need some advice on. It&#39;s hard to tell  <br/>
the level of intensity in a movie just from previews and the package.  <br/>
That&#39;s where reviews and websites are helping so we can help them  <br/>
gather information to make more informed decisions. And then *help*  <br/>
them through anything that might be difficult.<br/>

<br/>
Joyce, thank you so much for taking your time to answer this. So  <br/>
much! It was really important to me (not my friend and not to  <br/>
convince her). This helped me a LOT to understand unschooling more. I  <br/>
did and do *feel* it&#39;s right (for us) but I sometimes I don&#39;t get how  <br/>
it&#39;s applied. I made a big step.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to you and this list!<br/>

Oh forgot this part, really wanted to comment on this.  It isn&#39;t just  the <br/>
parent coming up with ideas, it is anyone there, including children,  partners <br/>
etc.  It isn&#39;t like I am the only one trying to come up with  something my <br/>

Even throw out silly ones to lighten the mood if it needs  it, and get everyone <br/>
in a creative mode.  <br/>
