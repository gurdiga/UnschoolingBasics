homeschooling article, but not an unschooling article.:)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We have educational goals, but our methods of accomplishing them <br/>
are challenging and require a lot of energy because we work to <br/>
motivate the kids to learn for themselves in a deep and meaningful <br/>
way. It&#39;s harder to motivate a child to read Plato than it is to <br/>
assign him the reading. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is not unschooling. I don&#39;t try to motivate my kids to learn <br/>
anything, I know that motivation comes from within. I don&#39;t have <br/>
goals for them, I trust their own goals are what matter most.<br/>
I DO however, try to provide a rich, nurturing, interesting <br/>
environment in which learning can blossom.<br/>
Our focus is enjoying life, learning happens all on its own.<br/>
<br/>
If a parent is trying to get the kids to enjoy Plato, I&#39;d call that <br/>
eclectic/relaxed homeschooling. At least the parents are interested <br/>
in making learning more fun, rather than complete drudgery.<br/>
Unschooling trusts that if a person does what they love, they will <br/>
eventually bump into some tidbit about Plato and ignore it or delve <br/>
into it as it fits (or doesn&#39;t fit) their life at that moment.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I read it too.<br/>
What she was talking about didn&#39;t really seem to have anything to do <br/>
with unschooling.<br/>
She says:<br/>
 <br/>
***So, we&#39;ve come up with our own philosophy and methods of <br/>
learning, taking ideas from here and there because it seemed natural <br/>
for our family to do so.***<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t that the very definition of eclectic homeschooling?<br/>
I think it would be a nice article, though, for someone trying to <br/>
move away from complete control but not quite ready or willing to <br/>
unschool.  <br/>
<br/>
I also noticed that she mentioned the &quot;challenge&quot; of instilling in <br/>
children a love of learning.  Huh?  That&#39;s not a challenge at all <br/>
unless you first squash it out of them! :-)<br/>
Children are born with a love of learning.<br/>

 <br/>
Right.<br/>
 <br/>
And it&#39;s unfortunate that so many people will read that and think that they  <br/>
know what unschooling IS. Very unfortunate.<br/>
 <br/>
Exactly why people will come to these unschooling e-lists and message  boards <br/>
and assume *we* are talking about the same thing. Structure. Motivation.  <br/>
Challenges. Control. Teaching. Educational goals. Leading.<br/>
 <br/>
And she even mentions how people want to be a part of the crowd or  &quot;culture.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;He talks about culture—those that have it and those  that want to have <br/>
 </span></blockquote>it. The second group gets all excited about having culture and  moving in <br/>
cultured circles (they are enamored with the &quot;idea&quot; of it). The first  group (the <br/>
truly cultured) does not think a thing about being cultured because  it is truly <br/>
a natural part of their lives. In our homeschooling, we need to be  careful <br/>
not to put on something because it sounds good or because we want to  hang in <br/>
certain circles. It’s a kind of sophisticated peer pressure.  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
And yet she wants to call herself an unschooler. This is the  problem. She <br/>
wants to hang in a &quot;certain unschooling circle,&quot; but is unable  to actually *be* <br/>
an unschooler.<br/>
 <br/>
Same old, same old.<br/>
