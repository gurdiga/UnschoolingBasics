<div id="ygrps-yiv-938956873">I&#39;m still struggling so much with the seemingly constant conflicts and<br/>
feelings of dislike between my 9 yo. and 5 yo. dds. They are both very<br/>
energetic, spirited, intelligent girls, but more often than not, they<br/>
don&#39;t get along. I&#39;m not looking for best friends here, but I do hope<br/>
for mutual respect (I know, not an unschooling term and they are <br/>
young).<br/>
<br/>
Before the second child was born, I read up a lot about making the<br/>
transition for the older child better. Ironically, the very things the<br/>
9 yo. constantly tells her sister to stop doing (i.e. talking and<br/>
singing all the time, being loud) are identical to her own behavior at<br/>
5 yo. However, she didn&#39;t have someone constantly telling her to stop,<br/>
as she does to her younger sister. I&#39;m afraid she&#39;s hurting her<br/>
younger sister&#39;s self-esteem. She almost bullies her, though, she<br/>
doesn&#39;t do this with anyone else. Outside of her younger sister, she<br/>
is very mature for her age - LOL.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, I don&#39;t want the 9 yo. to feel I&#39;m pushing her away<br/>
because of her behavior towards her sister. I try to have one-on-one<br/>
time with her (i.e. clothes shopping, movies, dinner), as her sister<br/>
does demand a lot of my attention right now. We play games together<br/>
and read books.<br/>
<br/>
There are moments where the two get a long, but out of a whole day, it<br/>
is usually an hour or less. Their fights are often violent, loud, and<br/>
end up with the 5 yo. trying to throw stuff or hit her sister with<br/>
things (usually with me in-between trying to protect the older one and<br/>
telling the younger one to use words such &quot;I&#39;m mad because XXX.&quot;) If<br/>
they do start fighting, I try to help them find ways to talk things<br/>
through. If that doesn&#39;t work I try and get them to find separate<br/>
projects in different rooms, but they both want to be with me and get<br/>
mad if I say I&#39;m going to go with one or the other. I&#39;ve read &quot;Sibling<br/>
Rivalry&quot; by Faber and Mazlish and it was very helpful, but I&#39;m still<br/>
having lots of issues.<br/>
<br/>
I know I&#39;m not seeing something and that I&#39;m doing something wrong, <br/>
but<br/>
I would appreciate others input on how I described the situation and<br/>
where I&#39;m blinded.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for everything!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-824011591">If it makes you feel better they sound a lot like me and my younger sister whe we were kids.<br/>
We used to fight like casts and dogs.<br/>
Things got better as we got older and now we are best friends.<br/>
WE talk several times a day on the phone and she even moved across country with her family to be near me.<br/>

Interesting the dynamic given the age difference.....I can relate.  My second child (ds 9) is almost 5 years older than his next youngest sister (dd 5).  It NEVER occured to me that they would not get along becuase of their age difference and their gender difference.  But of all my 4 kids, they seem to have the most difficulty most often.  Siblings without Rivalry has been great....and also remembering that although he is the &quot;older brother&quot;, I have to ramp my expectations down for him and not expect that he is necessarily an expert problem solver.  I think for them, the personality differences are so vast (he&#39;s REALLY laid back and she&#39;s very active and verbal) that they clash a bit more.  I&#39;m hoping with age, they will be able to see more eye to eye...I&#39;ve even noticed that in the last 6 months, they have more in common.  Oh, and Captain Underpants and Pokemon have helped them immensely to become more buddy-like!<br/>
HTH some....<br/>
