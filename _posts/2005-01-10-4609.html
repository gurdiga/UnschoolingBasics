proper letter or things like  that?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m a grammar Nazi, so my kids already know how to use adverbs,  pronouns, <br/>
and possessives before the gerund correctly! &lt;g&gt; They don&#39;t  know what they&#39;re <br/>
called, but because it&#39;s important to *me*, they hear it  correctly. It becomes <br/>
second nature. <br/>
 <br/>
I could say the same things about dogs: I show, train, breed, and groom  <br/>
dogs. They have naturally picked these things up and how to do them correctly.  It <br/>
just *happens* in a world rich in grammar and dogs! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
What do you mean, &quot;How do they learn English?&quot; I mean---seriously. Are they  <br/>
not talking yet? How did *you* learn it? I&#39;m guessing you had a pretty good  <br/>
grasp of the language before you went to school. Most children do.<br/>
 <br/>
Danielle&#39;s children will be more exposed to science than my kids. She AND  <br/>
her husband ARE scientists. It&#39;s something that happens naturally in their home. <br/>
 Robyn&#39;s child will understand more about the movie business. Deb&#39;s  son <br/>
already knows more about birds than mine boys ever will. Ren&#39;s  kids will have a <br/>
pretty good knowledge of art and architecture----can you guess  why?<br/>
 <br/>
People who live in Gettysburg, PA are literally surrounded by history.  <br/>
OBVIOUS history. But that&#39;s true *EVERYWHERE*. There&#39;s no place on this planet  <br/>
that doesn&#39;t have a history. OR science OR language OR math. <br/>
 <br/>
And sometimes a child who grows up in Gettysburg decides he&#39;s fascinated  <br/>
with 8th Century CHINA!  Go figure!<br/>
 <br/>
You&#39;re dividing the world into subjects. They&#39;re all connected. They&#39;re  <br/>
INTERconnected.<br/>
 <br/>
Give me a passion---any passion----and I can give you a &quot;school&quot; list of  <br/>
subjects covered.<br/>
 <br/>
Oh boy! HOMEWORK! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1032675817">***What do you do about grammar and english?***<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know anything about grammar and I went to school.  <br/>
<br/>
Dylan won&#39;t learn the finer points of grammar from me, but if he finds he<br/>
has a passion for adverbs,  pronouns, <br/>
 possessives and gerunds (sounds like some sort of infection) I&#39;ll tell<br/>
him to call Kelly. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The English thing is fairly well covered as both his parents are English<br/>
speaking and he has constant exposure to the language.  He reads H.P<br/>
Lovecraft for pleasure and while that may be considered by some the first<br/>
sign of insanity, he&#39;s understanding the language and enjoying the<br/>
stories. <br/>
<br/>
Dylan&#39;s Karate instructor, who had a degree in early childhood<br/>
development, used to say &quot;Don&#39;t kick nobody!&quot; when he&#39;d have his students<br/>
line up for drills.  Formal education doesn&#39;t ensure grammar skills. <br/>
<br/>
***What about history and math,science?***<br/>
<br/>
History is Dylan&#39;s great aunt Dortha who was born in 1917.  History is<br/>
Grandpa Ron&#39;s pocket watch.  History is Grandpa Lloyd&#39;s WWII Japanese<br/>
translation book.   History is every Passover with Grandma and aunt Ruth.<br/>
 History is the replica of the Globe theater on top of our hundred year<br/>
old piano.   History is his Welsh and Jewish and Dutch and Native<br/>
American ancestry.  History is a stop at a ghost town, or graveyard or an<br/>
abandoned mine, a trip to Boston, a constellation in the night sky.<br/>
<br/>
Math is counting change, making a deposit to a savings account, adding<br/>
score in Scrabble and Cribbage, shopping at the book store, doubling the<br/>
recipe for tortillas, measuring boards for a bookshelf, planting double<br/>
rows of bush beans.   <br/>
<br/>
Science is setting a broken bird wing, digging for crystals, grafting<br/>
apple trees, refinishing old rocking chairs, making fudge, rewiring a<br/>
lamp, building and soldering armatures for clay models. <br/>
<br/>
***I know you can learn a lot of things from everyday life <br/>
but how do the kids learn history or english and how to write a <br/>
proper letter or things like that?***<br/>
<br/>
Dylan knows about bits of history because his dad is a kind of history<br/>
buff and his mom is curious and because we&#39;re alive.  It&#39;s impossible to<br/>
watch the news or the Simpsons or a movie and not find a reference to<br/>
some bit of history.  It&#39;s impossible to talk with people or read about<br/>
people and not come away with questions about how they got to be who and<br/>
what they are. <br/>
<br/>
Dylan can write a fairly nice letter because we read letters to him all<br/>
his life.  We read letters from friends, we read letters to friends.  We<br/>
read letters from salesmen and credit card companies and charities.   He<br/>
can write a proper letter because he could always ask his mom and dad for<br/>
help if he needed to. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

She AND <br/>

Alas, I am not a Scientist--no where near as glamorous. My degree is in <br/>
English Literature. I&#39;m pretty good at writing, literature and history <br/>
because of my background. Dh does science, math and mechanics. Our big <br/>
joke is that the kids will get my math abilities and his language <br/>
abilities and be really screwed! ;) Thankfully, because we Unschool, our <br/>
children will not have the math or language *trauma* that helped <br/>
determine dh&#39;s and my aversions.<br/>
<br/>
What it also means is that my kids *love* doing experiments and can <br/>
recite the first part of William Blake&#39;s poem &quot;Tyger&quot; because they are <br/>
naturally exposed to this kind of stuff. They can also quote extensively <br/>
from Lord of the Rings, so go figure. ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-666507824">&lt;&lt;&lt;What do you do about grammar and english? What about history and <br/>
math,science? I know you can learn a lot of things from everyday life <br/>
but how do the kids learn history or english and how to write a <br/>
proper letter or things like that?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I can tell you our experience.  The kids didn&#39;t learn it at the same time their public school peers did.  There is no reason outside of a classroom for a 12 year old to know how to write a paper or even a lot about history unless these are particular interests of the child.<br/>
<br/>
My kids learned those specific kinds of things later but with tremendous ease.  They learned them when they actually needed them.<br/>
<br/>
My 14 yo is a died in the wool traditionalist &lt;sigh&gt; and has decided that the University of Georgia is in her future.  They require an accredited diploma or a very high SAT score to even consider you....so Adriane has decided to follow a very traditional curriculum to prepare.  She had zero math &quot;training&quot; from second grade until now.  She stepped right into Algebra and is doing fantastic (A average).  She is able to do what she wants, how she wants and we were able to avoid 7 years of me MAKING her do her homework.<br/>
<br/>
She had never written a paper, nothing more formal than email, in her life.  I showed her how to structure one and off she went and did fine.<br/>
<br/>
My kids actually know a lot of history but most of it was picked up from conversations, television, video games, etc..<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; History is Grandpa Ron&#39;s pocket watch.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>While this is true I think when someone is still seeing history as what&#39;s<br/>
contained in a textbook, it can read as though people are suggesting that if<br/>
subjects are redefined as something simplistic then it&#39;s no problem to<br/>
master them.<br/>
<br/>
If we redefine math as knowing that 1+1 is 2 then the math problem solved<br/>
;-)<br/>
<br/>
History resides in Grandpa Ron&#39;s watch but Grandpa Ron&#39;s watch is not<br/>
history (as defined by schools).<br/>
<br/>
If we define subjects as memorizing (oftimes boring) information, it is hard<br/>
to picture how kids can get that through unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
But if we define subjects as tools -- which is what they are! -- that help<br/>
us do what we want to do and help us understand how the world works, then we<br/>
learn &quot;subjects&quot; by using them.<br/>
<br/>
Math is a tool that helps us get what we want. It&#39;s hard to understand how<br/>
we can use math before we understand it but the way it works in real life is<br/>
we absorb a basic understanding by seeing numbers being used around us. And<br/>
we absorb a basic understanding. And then we can see how to apply that basic<br/>
understanding and use it. And as it we use it, we get better at it and<br/>
undertand more.<br/>
<br/>
English is a tool that helps us get what we want. As with all kids, my<br/>
daughter began with no knowledge of English and absorbed the parts that tied<br/>
into the things about life that interested her. No one crammed English into<br/>
her so that she&#39;d be able to use it. And she used bits and pieces inexpertly<br/>
to get what she wanted. For a long time she used &quot;Here&quot; for &quot;Pick me up&quot;,<br/>
&quot;Let me have that&quot;, &quot;Take me over there&quot;, &quot;Take this&quot;. It wasn&#39;t &quot;correct&quot;<br/>
but it worked for what she needed. And even though it worked, she didn&#39;t<br/>
stop there. She improved as a side effect of using English. She now uses<br/>
full sentences that other people can understand :-)<br/>
<br/>
History (as defined by school) isn&#39;t much use unless it ties to something we<br/>
want to know more about. Reading the Little House series isn&#39;t history (as<br/>
defined by school) but -- *if* a child is enjoying it and wants to read it<br/>
-- then tidbits of what was going on in the world that help a child<br/>
understand the parts of the story they cared about better become important<br/>
and interesting to the child. And if they care about any of the tidbits,<br/>
then more tidbits that tie to those become important. Real history isn&#39;t a<br/>
string of memorized names and dates. Real history (and science and math and<br/>
English) is how one thing connects to another.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the connections that are the important part of learning. No one can<br/>
give someone connections because there isn&#39;t one right way to connect<br/>
everything. Connections are what you pick up and assembly yourself by<br/>
leading a rich life.<br/>

know what you mean, really...I think...)<br/>

Michael is in Logistics and is actually working at ANG headquarters <br/>
here on Andrews (ANG Readiness Center)! All the bases he was at <br/>
before (1984-1992) are closed now except for Anderson on Guam (he was <br/>
a B52 navigator back then). So what will Ben be doing and at what <br/>
base? Why wouldn&#39;t it suprise me if they end up working together...<br/>

Not unless you move to SC and take on the Air National Guard. That&#39;s where  <br/>
Ben is now---and for the rest of his career, we think. He seems happy. I hope  <br/>
so. He&#39;s Squadron Commander---and if he hangs around long enough, he&#39;ll make  <br/>
Wing Commander and maybe Assistant Adjutant General (I did a paper on the  <br/>
state Adjutant General in FOURTH grade! That&#39;s how I know how to spell it!  &lt;G&gt;).<br/>

&gt; That would be a good way to NOT get invited back by the hotel, I bet!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If only I had some clue where we&#39;d be living by then, I might know if<br/>
&gt; we could make it. Dh got a list of open positions at quite a range of<br/>
&gt; bases. We could end up down the road from Ren or in Mountain Home,<br/>
&gt; Idaho or in Southern California at Vandenberg or in southern New<br/>
&gt; Mexico...we&#39;ll see!<br/>
