<div id="ygrps-yiv-595258620">I received this quote today from my Abraham-Hicks daily email:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Your children are genius creators who have just arrived from Nonphysical,<br/>
who are feeling empowered. And if they would be left to their own devices,<br/>
they would not go astray. They would maintain worthiness; they would<br/>
maintain their feeling of Well-Being. They would thrive, unless it was<br/>
taught otherwise to them. In other words, if others don&#39;t do something to<br/>
change their vibration, they are in a vibration of thriving. <br/>
<br/>
