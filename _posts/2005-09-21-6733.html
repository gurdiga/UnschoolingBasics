Okay anyhow a tangent is when a curve touches another curve at one <br/>
and only one point - like if you laid a board on top of a ball. &quot;A <br/>
straight line that touches but does not intersect a curve&quot; per <br/>
Webster&#39;s (expand line to include arcs and circles too like <br/>
balancing one ball atop another).<br/>

<br/>
To get the sine of an angle, pick one ray of the angle to be the<br/>
hypotenuse.  Then drop a line from some point on the hypotenuse to a<br/>
point on the other line where the other line and the new line are<br/>
perpendicular.  The new line is considered to be &quot;opposite&quot; to the<br/>
angle and the other line is &quot;adjacent&quot; to the angle.  Now the Sine of<br/>
an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite line to the length<br/>
of the hypotenuse.  The Cosine of the angle is the ratio of the <br/>
adjacent and the Hypotenuse and the Tangent is the ratio of the<br/>
opposite to the adjacent:<br/>
<br/>
Sin = opp/hyp<br/>
cos=adj/hyp<br/>
tan = opp/adj<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps!<br/>

I don&#39;t do the real numbers things well at all, but found that I <br/>
could manipulate those fake things pretty well (solve for x) until <br/>
they had me put real numbers in.<br/>
<br/>
I had one good math teacher during my schooling (guess what part of <br/>
math he taught? :) ) who was a psychology major.  He used to run on <br/>
intentional tangents whenever the class seemed to be mostly <br/>
distracted because there was a decent chance that we&#39;d become engaged <br/>
in the tangent and follow him back when he went back on topic.<br/>
<br/>
I will ALWAYS remember the definintion of a tangent, because of this. <br/>
