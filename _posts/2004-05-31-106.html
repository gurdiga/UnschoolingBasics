<div id="ygrps-yiv-308778164">&quot; But, in my own experience, online groups are NOT the best source <br/>
for REAL LIFE support, resources, and guidance.    Your quest <br/>
becomes cluttered and takes on inconsequential tangets that have <br/>
little significance in your actual day to day life.. Things like <br/>
defining unschooling and trying to place how one unschools in <br/>
varying degrees of &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; hinder from actually learning <br/>
anything about the lifestyle.    Personal conflicts only deter your <br/>
path to unschooling,  they do NOT enable it.  &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, but your personal experience is not relevant to all other <br/>
people of course.<br/>
Because the very thing you found a hindrance, I found the be THE <br/>
single most useful tool in helping me get to an unschooling mindset <br/>
and let go of the school baggage I&#39;d carried around for so long.<br/>
Eventually, finding real life unschoolers became important to me, <br/>
but not for defining unschooling, simply for friendship that didn&#39;t <br/>
come with a bunch of explanations.<br/>
<br/>
I do think meeting real life unschoolers is hugely valuable to a lot <br/>
of folks, but not everyone. <br/>
I have a solid support group, with 8 unschooling families and a host <br/>
of other homeschooling styles, that get together weekly...sometimes <br/>
more. So I do think your advice on finding real live unschoolers is <br/>
good.<br/>
<br/>
But just because some people get bogged down in discussion and <br/>
debate, doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t extremely helpful for others. I think <br/>
it was the absolute BEST thing for my personal journey.<br/>
<br/>
The advice I give, that I think applies to us all, is I encourage <br/>
people to research a LOT of different resources. Read many different <br/>
books, check out lots of online lists and sites and speak to many <br/>
different people. No one should be trusting one source of <br/>
information for all of their knowledge. <br/>
I trust that we all are capable of finding the methods and styles of <br/>
learning that work best for US personally (whoa, an unschooling <br/>
concept) and the most helpful sources and people are going to be <br/>
different for every journey.<br/>
