<div id="ygrps-yiv-1513175627">Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I hope someone will be able to tell me I did ok. I am struggling with some<br/>
guilt over this.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We are having a HUGE heat wave for us. It has been in the high 30&#39;s all week<br/>
and I am 6 months pregnant. I have managed fairly well so far but yesterday<br/>
and today were brutal. I just had no energy and really could not face<br/>
another day of the sun beating down on us. I have been taking dd to the<br/>
lake, water parks and to daily soccer all week. Today I took her to her<br/>
swimming lesson early on and then we went out to the mall for a bite to eat<br/>
and some cool time.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We got home around 1 and I was just to tired and beaten by the heat, all I<br/>
wanted to do was sit and veg, watch TV or be on the computer or nap. My dh<br/>
is useless in the heat and has spent the better part of the last 3 days in<br/>
his music room where it is cool and we have barely seen him, so I have felt<br/>
like providing everything for my dd has fallen on me. And I thought I did<br/>
pretty good until today, but I was just done in.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So we got home and I turned on the TV for her to her station (kids cartoons<br/>
all the time) and she has sat and watched that happily, then she spent 3<br/>
hours on the Polly Pocket website (thank you to whoever posted that URL, we<br/>
just visited it yesterday and I have a little addict on my hands, I can&#39;t<br/>
believe how much she has learned to do on the computer in two days!) and<br/>
then more TV. It will be bedtime soon, and then we will read some stories.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I just feel like I have let her down, like I should have taken her to a<br/>
water park or to the lake or something to play and be outside in the nice<br/>
weather and in the water to cool down. I think I hear my mom saying that on<br/>
nice days you should be outside, which I guess I agree with, but sometimes<br/>
it is just too hot to be outside right?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So I guess I just need some support that having such a passive day is ok.<br/>
she doesn&#39;t seem unhappy, we have not had a fight, she has eaten well and I<br/>
think she might have learned some things. If she was bored we would have had<br/>
less contentment and more agitation I think.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for listening I guess I needed to just get it out and if<br/>
anyone has anything to say I am happy to listen to it,<br/>

<br/>
**Hi Sherri-Lee - You can&#39;t stop your mother from saying things irl, but you<br/>
don&#39;t have to let her talk in your head &lt;g&gt;.  There&#39;s nothing inherently<br/>
better about being outside on a hot day.   Your day didn&#39;t sound &#39;passive&#39;<br/>
to me.  It sounds like you  had a fun, connected day together, and you were<br/>
both happy with what you were doing.  What&#39;s more important than that?<br/>
<br/>
I think getting rid of the &#39;shoulds&#39; goes a long way towards living a joyful<br/>
life.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;My dh<br/>
 </span></blockquote>is useless in the heat<br/>
<br/>
**I don&#39;t mean to sound harsh, but more useless than a woman who&#39;s six<br/>
months pregnant and spends the majority of her time caring for a young<br/>
child?  Have you asked him for some help in finding ways that you can get<br/>
some rest?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and you did ok today :0).  ~Rue<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-955771905">What a BEAUTIFUL day it sounds like you had Sherri-Lee.  If she was <br/>
content and doing things she enjoyed that is great!  Remember, she <br/>
is affected by the heat too...I think we all do a little better on <br/>
days like this if we just take it easy.  Especially if we are 6 mo <br/>
pregnant!  You are doing great!  Oh, btw, you said something about <br/>
feeling guilty about not taking her out in the nice weather...it <br/>
wasn&#39;t that nice!  Grueling heat can make for a cranky mommy and a <br/>
cranky kid....even a the waterpark!  We have had quite a few LAZY <br/>
days of summer around here too.  Lots of movies and computer time.  <br/>
Anyway...sit down, put your feet up and pat yourself on the back (or <br/>
the tummy)...IMO, you did good.<br/>

<br/>
You bet it is! And if you were uncomfortably hot, maybe dd was also.<br/>
<br/>
I kept waiting to read about the disaster that ensued - and then none did.<br/>
Re-read your own post describing a delightful day with a great positive<br/>
result for dd, and feel better. Sometimes a quiet day at home is exactly<br/>
what is needed to balance lots of time out and about.<br/>
<br/>
The only issue I saw, is that you seem to have a bit of resentment creeping<br/>
up on you about being left with all the responsibility while dh is dodging<br/>
it and staying comfortable. My experience with that is that resentment is a<br/>
fast growing insidious critter, and best brought out while small before it<br/>
explodes out of its cage full grown. Just a little thought.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1224902361">I am exhausted just hearing about your day. lol. Wow. Supermom. Wow. <br/>
Please give yourself a break mentally, physically, emotionally. <br/>
<br/>
The most important lesson I have learned as a parent is that I need <br/>
to take care of myself before I can take care of anyone else. <br/>
<br/>
&#39;You can&#39;t serve soup from an empty pot.&#39; <br/>
<br/>
I have found that my son will resist going and doing when we have <br/>
done too much out-of-the-house play or activities. My &quot;Waldorf&quot; <br/>
friend maintains that all of that stuff is overstimulating to <br/>
children before age 10 or so. I fall closer to your side of the <br/>
fence. We go and do alot. But I do see how my son needs time to <br/>
process the activities and incorporate our outings in his play IF he <br/>
has non-structured, uninterrupted time to play. So, I purposefully <br/>
provide this for him. <br/>
<br/>
When it is hot, I try to do outings early. Then we come home to <br/>
reflect and process and re-center ourselves in our familiar <br/>
environment. One can only learn in a non-threatening environment and <br/>
the world has a lot of unfamiliar and disruptive activity. Even at <br/>
the playground, I see that he gets upset when mothers are not <br/>
responding to their crying babies immediately. Or when he sees others <br/>
yelling or pushing at the pool or park. We discuss these thing at the <br/>
time but they are &quot;play acted&quot; at home: &quot;mama is going to take care <br/>
of the baby&quot;, &quot;please don&#39;t take that from my hands&quot;, etc. He <br/>
processes the important parts of his day in his play. This allows him <br/>
to get a handle on the outside world. <br/>
<br/>
Home is a safe place to practice. Home is just as important as the <br/>
world. More important, even? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1172317821">Yes, what are your expectations of yourself once the baby is born? I <br/>
agree: no &quot;shoulds&quot;. Do your best but don&#39;t scold yourself for being <br/>
human. Celebrate that we are a species that can help each other. Ask <br/>
for help. Accept help. These were very hard for me to learn. It does <br/>
not diminish your abilities to accept another&#39;s assistance. Part of <br/>
parenting is learning interdependence.<br/>
<br/>
The baby will require mama, basically exclusively. Round up help now <br/>
for respite for yourself. Your husband is part of this calvary. He <br/>
can be your hero. Let him know how to help. Usually, my husband just <br/>
doesn&#39;t read my mind. I just don&#39;t understand this problem. lol. lol.<br/>
He wants to help. He also wants to do whatever he finds fun. It is <br/>
challenging but better than burning yourself out. Then it is really <br/>
hard to find solutions. <br/>
<br/>
P.S. Sleep as much as possible.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1731392303">If you&#39;ve been out a lot of days, it&#39;s great to have a quiet indoor <br/>
day!<br/>
<br/>
Also, some people love to be out in hot weather, swimming and doing <br/>
other outdoor activities.  I&#39;m not one of those people.  I really <br/>
feel ill if it&#39;s extremely hot.  When it&#39;s cool or even cold, that&#39;s <br/>
when I want to be outside walking, going to the playground, or even <br/>
swimming.  Our pool here stayed open through November last year, and <br/>
my dd and I were often the only ones there.  It&#39;s so invigorating to <br/>
me!  The other day we were at the pool in hot weather, and I heard <br/>
someone complain about how cold the water was.  I and a few other <br/>
people looked at him in disbelief.  People are different!<br/>

You did great!<br/>
 <br/>
It sounds like you guys had a great day.<br/>
 <br/>
I think people have to keep in mind that extreme temperatures are just the same on both sides of the 0 (zero).  Ya know?  If it were way below 0 we wouldn&#39;t be outside either. (Well,  I wouldn&#39;t be, anyway.)<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
This same thing came up this last week with me.  We have just recently moved and were back in that town to mow and take care of the house we&#39;re trying to sell.  My ds wanted to invite a friend over to play a new video game he just got.  Sounded good to me,  it was over 90 degrees F and very humid.  <br/>
 <br/>
My son comes back home and reports that his friend has to play outside.   Not only is this child never allowed to do what he wants, he also can&#39;t be playing where he wants.  :(<br/>
 <br/>
These parents believe kids should be outside playing.  No matter what the temperature.<br/>
 <br/>
Where are the parents?  Inside the cool house.<br/>
 <br/>
ARGH.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Anyway,,there&#39;s nothing wrong with spending a day at home--relaxing, watching TV, playing on the computer.  We choose to have lots of those days!<br/>

What a BEAUTIFUL day it sounds like you had Sherri-Lee.  If she was <br/>
content and doing things she enjoyed that is great!  Remember, she <br/>
is affected by the heat too...I think we all do a little better on <br/>
days like this if we just take it easy.  Especially if we are 6 mo <br/>
pregnant!  You are doing great!  Oh, btw, you said something about <br/>
feeling guilty about not taking her out in the nice weather...it <br/>
wasn&#39;t that nice!  Grueling heat can make for a cranky mommy and a <br/>
cranky kid....even a the waterpark!  We have had quite a few LAZY <br/>
days of summer around here too.  Lots of movies and computer time.  <br/>
Anyway...sit down, put your feet up and pat yourself on the back (or <br/>
the tummy)...IMO, you did good.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1671535336">Hi Robyn,<br/>
<br/>
Yes I think after the week we had a quiet day at home fit the bill. She sure<br/>
didn&#39;t complain, we didn&#39;t fight or argue and she didn&#39;t ask to do more than<br/>
she was. So I guess I should just see the obvious and be done with it right?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
I have had some real strong issues regarding resentment towards my dh<br/>
especially since my dd has been born. He is much better at taking care of<br/>
himself than I am. I often feel that he does it to the exclusion of others<br/>
without thinking about his responsibility to his family (her mostly). He<br/>
will go for a nap and not think about how his daughter will spend time on<br/>
her own while he is in another room. He won&#39;t do anything to set her up<br/>
except turn on the TV and I guess that is my issue with thinking she needs<br/>
to have more activity than that and that he is somehow selfish to put<br/>
himself first over playing with her.... hmmmmm... might be something more<br/>
for me to think about there. Ok... thank you for helping me to think about<br/>
that,<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;I think I hear my mom saying that on<br/>
nice days you should be outside, which I guess I agree with, but sometimes<br/>
it is just too hot to be outside right?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You bet it is! And if you were uncomfortably hot, maybe dd was also.<br/>
<br/>
I kept waiting to read about the disaster that ensued - and then none did.<br/>
Re-read your own post describing a delightful day with a great positive<br/>
result for dd, and feel better. Sometimes a quiet day at home is exactly<br/>
what is needed to balance lots of time out and about.<br/>
<br/>
The only issue I saw, is that you seem to have a bit of resentment creeping<br/>
up on you about being left with all the responsibility while dh is dodging<br/>
it and staying comfortable. My experience with that is that resentment is a<br/>
fast growing insidious critter, and best brought out while small before it<br/>
explodes out of its cage full grown. Just a little thought.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1119174851">HI Rue,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for this. I appreciate hearing from more seasoned unschoolers that<br/>
the day wasn&#39;t a waste. And that is how my knee jerk reaction sees it so I<br/>
will work on that.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I do need to get rid of the &quot;shoulds&quot; around some parenting issues yes, and<br/>
my mom does need to get out of my head. She is so much more out now than<br/>
ever, so I am making headway:-) but still have a way to go. She was a very<br/>
powerful figure in my life that was extremely critical and impossible for me<br/>
to please her. And being who I am, that is the person who&#39;s approval I have<br/>
spent the most time trying to get. It has never worked. As I learned a while<br/>
ago, she does not see herself as having value, so she can not look at me,<br/>
who came from her body as having value. She also has a lot of issues with<br/>
the fact that my 3 older siblings were adopted and then I came along as a<br/>
surprise. I have always been under the 8 ball to apologize for my existence,<br/>
like I didn&#39;t deserve to intrude on how great things were and have always<br/>
been the outsider. So getting those messages out of my head are extremely<br/>
important and difficult.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
As to the &quot;useless&quot; comment. hmmm. more useless than a 6 month pregnant<br/>
woman who spends her time taking care of a 4 year old? Yes I would say he is<br/>
sometimes. He doesn&#39;t take care of the 4 year old when we are both tired or<br/>
hot, I suck it up and do what needs to be done and he retreats. I have asked<br/>
him, and most of the time he is wonderful and helpful and willing to try to<br/>
do anything to help me out and make me happy, sometimes (like the last week)<br/>
he retreats into his cave and acts like a hungry bear whenever disturbed.<br/>
Very difficult to live with.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thank you for your thoughts and insight, it has helped me get some<br/>
clarity.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
**Hi Sherri-Lee - You can&#39;t stop your mother from saying things irl, but you<br/>
don&#39;t have to let her talk in your head &lt;g&gt;.  There&#39;s nothing inherently<br/>
better about being outside on a hot day.   Your day didn&#39;t sound &#39;passive&#39;<br/>
to me.  It sounds like you  had a fun, connected day together, and you were<br/>
both happy with what you were doing.  What&#39;s more important than that?<br/>
<br/>
I think getting rid of the &#39;shoulds&#39; goes a long way towards living a joyful<br/>
life.<br/>

months pregnant and spends the majority of her time caring for a young<br/>
child?  Have you asked him for some help in finding ways that you can get<br/>
some rest?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and you did ok today :0).  ~Rue<br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We are busy. she is a very social person and I can see if we spend two or<br/>
more days in a row at home we become very owlie and get on each others<br/>
nerves. If I am with it and take her out right away, the energy changes and<br/>
we are fine again.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This last week was more busy than usual. She had a soccer camp each morning<br/>
at 9 and then from there we were at a park or lake to try to cool off.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
You are right I do need to let myself have a break more often and just take<br/>
care of myself without the guilt.<br/>

I am exhausted just hearing about your day. lol. Wow. Supermom. Wow. <br/>
Please give yourself a break mentally, physically, emotionally. <br/>
<br/>
The most important lesson I have learned as a parent is that I need <br/>
to take care of myself before I can take care of anyone else. <br/>
<br/>
&#39;You can&#39;t serve soup from an empty pot.&#39; <br/>
<br/>
I have found that my son will resist going and doing when we have <br/>
done too much out-of-the-house play or activities. My &quot;Waldorf&quot; <br/>
friend maintains that all of that stuff is overstimulating to <br/>
children before age 10 or so. I fall closer to your side of the <br/>
fence. We go and do alot. But I do see how my son needs time to <br/>
process the activities and incorporate our outings in his play IF he <br/>
has non-structured, uninterrupted time to play. So, I purposefully <br/>
provide this for him. <br/>
<br/>
When it is hot, I try to do outings early. Then we come home to <br/>
reflect and process and re-center ourselves in our familiar <br/>
environment. One can only learn in a non-threatening environment and <br/>
the world has a lot of unfamiliar and disruptive activity. Even at <br/>
the playground, I see that he gets upset when mothers are not <br/>
responding to their crying babies immediately. Or when he sees others <br/>
yelling or pushing at the pool or park. We discuss these thing at the <br/>
time but they are &quot;play acted&quot; at home: &quot;mama is going to take care <br/>
of the baby&quot;, &quot;please don&#39;t take that from my hands&quot;, etc. He <br/>
processes the important parts of his day in his play. This allows him <br/>
to get a handle on the outside world. <br/>
<br/>
Home is a safe place to practice. Home is just as important as the <br/>
world. More important, even? <br/>
<br/>
Pat<br/>

&gt; have taken her to a<br/>
&gt; water park or to the lake or something to play and<br/>
&gt; be outside in the nice<br/>
&gt; weather and in the water to cool down. I think I<br/>
&gt; hear my mom saying that on<br/>
&gt; nice days you should be outside, which I guess I<br/>
&gt; agree with, but sometimes<br/>
&gt; it is just too hot to be outside right?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yikes!  So you go running around every day?!?!  Ugh! <br/>
I seldom leave my house in the summer--unless it&#39;s to<br/>
go somewhere COOL, and NEVER if it&#39;s over 90.  I think<br/>
your husband has the right idea--maybe you are useless<br/>
in the sun as well but he doesn&#39;t have your mother&#39;s<br/>
voice ringing in his ears?  STAY HOME AND LIKE IT!! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-799170067">OK. you got me, you reminded me of my mom yelling me from the top of the<br/>
stairs to get out of the house and off the couch and DO SOMETHING outside<br/>
while the weather was nice! However, she would NEVER come out and do<br/>
anything with me except work - mow the lawn, trim the edging, garden, take<br/>
the dog for a walk. And she was so controlling about how these things had to<br/>
be done, it was no fun. So ok. thank you that story has helped me to narrow<br/>
in the trigger.<br/>

You did great!<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you guys had a great day.<br/>
<br/>
I think people have to keep in mind that extreme temperatures are just the<br/>
same on both sides of the 0 (zero).  Ya know?  If it were way below 0 we<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be outside either. (Well,  I wouldn&#39;t be, anyway.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This same thing came up this last week with me.  We have just recently moved<br/>
and were back in that town to mow and take care of the house we&#39;re trying to<br/>
sell.  My ds wanted to invite a friend over to play a new video game he just<br/>
got.  Sounded good to me,  it was over 90 degrees F and very humid.  <br/>
<br/>
My son comes back home and reports that his friend has to play outside.<br/>
Not only is this child never allowed to do what he wants, he also can&#39;t be<br/>
playing where he wants.  :(<br/>
<br/>
These parents believe kids should be outside playing.  No matter what the<br/>
temperature.<br/>
<br/>
Where are the parents?  Inside the cool house.<br/>
<br/>
ARGH.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway,,there&#39;s nothing wrong with spending a day at home--relaxing,<br/>
watching TV, playing on the computer.  We choose to have lots of those days!<br/>

Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I hope someone will be able to tell me I did ok. I am struggling with some<br/>
guilt over this.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We are having a HUGE heat wave for us. It has been in the high 30&#39;s all week<br/>
and I am 6 months pregnant. I have managed fairly well so far but yesterday<br/>
and today were brutal. I just had no energy and really could not face<br/>
another day of the sun beating down on us. I have been taking dd to the<br/>
lake, water parks and to daily soccer all week. Today I took her to her<br/>
swimming lesson early on and then we went out to the mall for a bite to eat<br/>
and some cool time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
