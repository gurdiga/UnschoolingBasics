<div id="ygrps-yiv-1060386028">I believe in unschooling. That doesn&#39;t mean I have rerouted all my &quot;old&quot;<br/>
thoughts or erased all the old tapes running in my head:) I have always<br/>
done the best I could to unschool myself. Whether or not I believed<br/>
myself was the clincher. I wasn&#39;t sure if I should believe what I was<br/>
taught by family, school, society, etc. or my own thoughts. Luckily I am<br/>
fairly stubborn. I gave birth to six children and opened my heart to<br/>
another who is our fosterson soon to be adopted. Of coarse there has<br/>
been the usual situations and some really difficult ones. I still<br/>
remember the ache in my heart when each of my kids went to kindergarten.<br/>
I am glad I finally believed in myself enought to unschool. I am having<br/>
a hard time though with my own thought patterns regarding my fosterson<br/>
who is 8. He is 3-4 emotionally, according to his therapist who deals<br/>
specifically with kids with reactive attachment disorder (like Helen<br/>
Keller had). He also had defiant disorder, eating disorder,<br/>
post-traumatic stress disorder reactions, etc. - a bunch of labels. I<br/>
feel constantly irritated by him. He wakes me up every morning by asking<br/>
me if he can get dressed, where is the food, walking on his tip toes,<br/>
falling over things, screeching, etc. Every morning for the last year or<br/>
more I have repeated myself about &quot;yes, get dressed&quot; and he asks again<br/>
the next day. I think he wants my attention and he has learned that this<br/>
is how it is done. He has had 13 placements including a state-run<br/>
institution where he lived for one year. He is on Concerta which helps<br/>
calm him down. Without it he seems &quot;drunk.&quot; Speaking of cleaning his<br/>
room, we do that together. He choosed to keep his room very cluttered<br/>
like he keeps his desk at school. Maybe I am too old and &quot;stuck&quot; in my<br/>
ways. He is intelligent and very creative. He likes to dress up as a<br/>
girl, including tieing a shirt on his head to look like hair, makeup,<br/>
highheels, and a dress. Some people have had difficulty with this and<br/>
most don&#39;t, including me. I believe in his right to be who he is. I know<br/>
I feel a great responsibility towards him and the state. That gets in my<br/>
way. Some where in my thought patterns I end up feeling very frustrated<br/>
with the whole business. I have people telling me to &quot;make him behave&quot;<br/>
when he won&#39;t go to his room, when he throws a fit, etc. I don&#39;t have a<br/>
magic wand. He is very manipulative, has a great need to control people<br/>
including teachers, therapists, etc. I would think that he would be<br/>
tired of all the adults controling him. There are at least a dozen<br/>
adults who work with him. Either way, I feel overwhelmed so I can<br/>
imagine how he feels. This summer he has had camp which he has loved. So<br/>
far he has had 4 weeks and we may get another two. Other than that he<br/>
has 3 different people from the same agency who are called &quot;skills<br/>
workers&quot; that pick him up 3 days a week and do &quot;skills&quot; with<br/>
him/socializing him. His therapist said the main concern is to bond with<br/>
him and have everyone on his team knowing to refer back to &quot;mom&quot; to<br/>
assist him in bonding. He goes to public school and is high-maintenance<br/>
there. He constanty demands attention so he has a tutor to help direct<br/>
him. The teacher he has this year was one of my kids teachers. She was<br/>
one of the main reasons I decided to unschool at home. Perhaps after we<br/>
adopt him I will unschool him although right now I feel overwhelmed<br/>
enough. Maybe we could do with less &quot;help&quot; by then and it will feel<br/>
better. Michele  <br/>
