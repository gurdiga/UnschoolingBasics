<div id="ygrps-yiv-1891773542">&quot;And, too, I think most of us would also try to gauge the situation<br/>
ahead of time and prepare, plan, and arrange things to be more<br/>
comfortable for those involved (kids AND adults) or just not go if<br/>
the child or children were just not at a place where they could<br/>
handle it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes. I don&#39;t think a toddler standing at a booth is a big deal, I<br/>
personally don&#39;t try to stop my kids unless it is potentially<br/>
dangerous or bothering other people (unless those other people are<br/>
bothered by just about everything...then I say &quot;to hell with it&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
If you ask folks that ate out with me at the first two conferences,<br/>
they&#39;ll probably tell you they never really ate WITH me!! I followed<br/>
Jalen around the restaurant pointing at pictures and trying to keep<br/>
him happily distracted. He never actually sat to eat. I would come by<br/>
the table on a walk-about and grab some food for myself. Snatching 2-3<br/>
bites at a time is how I survived.<br/>
<br/>
We just didn&#39;t eat out much at all when he was younger. He still<br/>
doesn&#39;t sit through a whole meal, which at home is no big deal. On the<br/>
rare occasions we go out, he always ends up without shoes on, either<br/>
hiding under the table or walking around the table. We just make sure<br/>
he isn&#39;t out in the aisles, but right near us. I am still amazed that<br/>
I can actually sit and eat a meal now.:)<br/>
