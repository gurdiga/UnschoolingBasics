<div id="ygrps-yiv-1227767213">I don&#39;t know if any of you have heard about this, but there is a Yahoo <br/>
homeschooling pen pal group.  It just started last week.  It looks <br/>
pretty interesting.  Here is the link: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/homeschoolcorrespondencecompanions/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/homeschoolcorrespondencecompanions/</a><br/>
Pass the word onto other homeschoolers if you wish.  They are trying <br/>
to build their list up.  Thanks!<br/>
