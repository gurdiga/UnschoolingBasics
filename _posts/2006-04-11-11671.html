<div id="ygrps-yiv-1112271748">&quot; The problem I had with the group here is that<br/>
it&#39;s hard to get something started when you don&#39;t have the support of<br/>
the group leader (in this case a baron who hated dancing, only wore<br/>
garb because he had to, took no effort in doing anything medieval -<br/>
not sure why he is even in the SCA - oh yeah, he gets to hit people<br/>
with stick and feel powerful.)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t care for the group in Pensacola either. It&#39;s a poor Barony<br/>
(not their fault) so they aren&#39;t very careful about keeping things<br/>
period and there are a lot of CHEAP looking short cuts. I don&#39;t mind<br/>
inexpensive, but inexpensive can be done well. It wasn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the Baron there really bugged me.  He drilled my poor guys so<br/>
much about sword fighting that they got turned off to the SCA in<br/>
general. Trevor really wanted to explore archery and he made fun of<br/>
it. Lame. My kids should have been supported in whatever they chose to<br/>
explore.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re going to check out the group here. We&#39;re still in the Kingdom of<br/>
Meridies.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sorry!  SCA = Society for Creative Anachronism.  It&#39;s a historic recreation<br/>
NPO dedicated to the study and recreation of the middle ages (ca. 600 -<br/>
1600)  It can be a lot of fun!  They hold &quot;events&quot; that can range from wars,<br/>
to battles to tournaments, feast, balls, classes, symposia on various topics<br/>
from the middle ages.  The main web page is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sca.org">http://www.sca.org</a> and there are<br/>
regional &quot;kingdoms&quot; all over the world.<br/>

But the &quot;T&quot; word is not the goal!!!!<br/>
<br/>
FUN is!<br/>
<br/>
The LEARNING happens as side effect!<br/>
<br/>
Please don&#39;t go to teach history. Go to have fun (if the kids like it. <br/>
YOU do it alone if you enjoy it.). They WILL learn. And NOT just <br/>
history. They&#39;ll learn math and science and art and social science and <br/>
music and geography and geology and physics and chemistry---and all <br/>
sorts of other things. But they&#39;ll learn them because  they ARE having <br/>
fun.<br/>
<br/>
Change your view and your words. It will open your world in so many <br/>
ways!!<br/>

   <br/>
  They will realize they&#39;re learning, and that&#39;s just fine.  Part of embracing an authentic life is to realize that we are all learning, all the time.  Have you stopped learning just because no one else is arranging for you to be in a &#39;learning environment?&#39;  <br/>
   <br/>
  My kids know they are learning new things every day -- and they&#39;re excited about it.  They figure out new stuff all the time.  It&#39;s the way life is supposed to be.  The only kids I know who feel like they don&#39;t want to learn anything are the kids who are schooled and come to equate learning with being taught, thinking the only way to learn is to be taught, so learning must be bad.<br/>
   <br/>
  It&#39;s okay if someday your kids figure out that learning is everywhere.  It&#39;s not okay if your methods lead your kids to feel like you&#39;ve been setting up learning opportunities for them -- that says you don&#39;t trust that learning will happen, that you still feel you have to make it happen to them.  Just encourage them to live full, authentic lives -- learning can&#39;t be avoided.<br/>

the ice cream, but as the ice cream itself!  Something they want to seek out<br/>
and is enjoyable (and helps keep you cool on a hot summer day - ok, maybe<br/>
I&#39;m asking too much on that front LOL!)<br/>

Yes, I wish I had heard of this before ever putting my children in  public <br/>
school.  But where I live homeschooling itself is taboo.  Its  never talked <br/>
about, and I had never even heard of unschooling.<br/>

I don&#39;t think so. There are times when one of my kids, Qacei especially, will not rest until she has figured out whatever it is she is working on. When she wants to learn HTML coding, I think it is almost a release when she finally figures it out. Kind of like that refreshing cool drink.<br/>
