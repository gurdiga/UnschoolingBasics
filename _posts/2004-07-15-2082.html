<div id="ygrps-yiv-1118791975">HI, I have been reading the emails for a couple of months now, <br/>
evening posting a couple of times. I love reading the posts, although <br/>
I can find very few that I can relate to in my situation. I have <br/>
checked out Annie O&#39;s writings and find them wonderful. But I am <br/>
looking for some concrete experiences.<br/>
<br/>
I am homeschooling my wonderful seven year old daughter with <br/>
asperger&#39;s syndrome. (For those of you who are not familiar with this <br/>
it is basically high functioning autism. She has the social and <br/>
language issues of autism but to a lesser degree. She is verbal, and <br/>
actually has a great vocabulary but uses language differently. She is <br/>
smart, but processes information in a way that I haven&#39;t actually <br/>
gotten the hang of. She obsesses over a few things to the exclusion <br/>
of what is going on around her. She is currently obsessing over <br/>
sweets and the zoo. And sweets at the zoo. This is all she is <br/>
interested in at the moment.)<br/>
<br/>
I love the idea of unschooling with her, but I am having a hard time <br/>
letting go of the idea that I need to insist that she learn certain <br/>
things at certain times. When you have a child who has aspergers <br/>
the &quot;professionals&quot; really try to drum it in to you that you need to <br/>
drill, drill, drill and impose yourself on your child and rip them <br/>
out of their isolated world. WE HAVE NOT DONE THIS SO FAR at home - <br/>
she does get speech therapy and sensory ot - she has many sensory <br/>
issues, but I am getting a little less confident as time goes on that <br/>
she doesn&#39;t need the more traditional approach. Truthfully, I cannot <br/>
tell what she is learning.<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I am asking is this: is there anyone on this list that <br/>
has a child with significant learning/developmental issues that is <br/>
unschooling? I am looking for a concrete experience: this is how it <br/>
went for us..... As I said, I loved Annie&#39;s writings, but they are <br/>
vague in her child&#39;s challenges and how he is working with <br/>
unschooling. Sorry to sound desperate, but I am, a little. Thanks.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-535713376">Hi Susan, you are not alone.  My daughter is also an Aspie.  She&#39;s <br/>
14.  I&#39;ve found that unschooling is the only way for her.  She could <br/>
never have sat down with lessons!  Her latest obsession is online <br/>
role playing.  Role playing is basically acting out a story that the <br/>
kids make up as they go along--they get into character and play a <br/>
role.  I&#39;m figuring this helps her with her social skills as she can <br/>
act things out.  She has major social skills issues.  Before this <br/>
obsession, her obsession was poetry.  She made friends online with <br/>
writers and she is having three of her poems published in a book.  <br/>
<br/>
The other subjects will come when they are ready.  For example, if <br/>
my daughter wants to burn CD&#39;s she has to figure out how much space <br/>
she has and how many songs will fit on the CD based on their <br/>
length.  She also knows how to check unit prices to figure out what <br/>
is cheapest.  <br/>
<br/>
AnneO is great, isn&#39;t she?  I&#39;ve been fighting with people not to <br/>
change my daughter for so long and AnneO comes along and just says <br/>
in a calm and soothing voice that your children should be honored <br/>
for who they are.  When she says that, who could ever want their <br/>
children to change?<br/>
<br/>
***She is verbal, and actually has a great vocabulary but uses <br/>
language differently.***<br/>
<br/>
Susan, I&#39;ve recently heard about Hyperplexia.  Have you heard of <br/>
it?  It&#39;s basically what you said about language and it is often <br/>
seen with Asperger&#39;s.  I&#39;m thinking my daughter might have it too, <br/>
but to a lesser degree since my daughter didn&#39;t read until she was <br/>
12.  She could read the most complex word, but she had no clue what <br/>
it meant when you put it in a sentence.  She had little <br/>
comprehension.  Now that she&#39;s been unschooling and allowed time to <br/>
figure out the world of the written word for herself, she is so far <br/>
advanced in Language and Grammar skills.  <br/>
<br/>
I did sit with her for a little bit and help her figure out the <br/>
action in a sentence and who was doing the action.  Once she got <br/>
over that hurdle, her comprehension just took off.  If your daughter <br/>
wanted to knit a scarf, you&#39;d show her how, then you&#39;d let her make <br/>
her scarf herself, right?  It&#39;s the same with learning anything.  <br/>
You observe and listen to what your child is interested in, even if <br/>
it&#39;s snacks and the zoo.  If you see your child struggling, you <br/>
offer help.  Don&#39;t believe that your daughter needs things drilled <br/>
into her.  It will only frustrate the both of you.  <br/>
<br/>
I could sit and discuss this subject all day but I have to run.  I <br/>
hope this helps you a little until others come along.<br/>

It does help - tons. Do you or did you do speech or OT services with your daughter?  How do unschoolers feel about getting theraputic help? It seems to go against the philosophy but then again if your child is having major issues you have to do something!<br/>
 <br/>
Grace had so many sensory issues that we felt we had to do something - she would hardly touch anything! She wasn&#39;t comfortable in her own skin until very recently.<br/>

This is one I mull over frequently. I have a 6 yo with autism. He was non verbal until around the age of four. We have done work with biomeds, and have seen progress. However, his speech is still largely unintelligible. He needs speech and language therapy, among other things. A lot of things, before his diagnosis, were &quot;just jordie&quot;. It&#39;s a challenge to continue to look at it that way, ever since the label was applied. OTOH, it was liberating to get that label, to find out that these things weren&#39;t MY fault (and yes, for some things I really did think it was!). He went to school for three months of last year. He will be going again next year, to an autism specific program in our district. Part of the reason is that I am at a loss. At a loss on how to help him. Hopefully as we continue biomed treatments, we will see more improvements, more self control, and less aggression. I too, am right along with you in questioning the drill drill drill aspect. His teacher from last year says<br/>
 that the only way he may be able to learn his &quot;basics&quot; is by rote. Me, I&#39;m wondering - what will happen if we sit back and wait two to three years, to see how he does on his own? OTOH, there is a really good chance with his lack of understanding of anything sequential that by rote may be the only way. Waiting will mean we have lost all that time. Coming from an unschooled and at the least, delayed academic perspective, this is all puzzling to me. To me, basics means tying your shoe, buttoning your own pants, and other daily living and social skills, not counting to ten and saying your ABC&#39;s. Thankfully, the TEACCH program is a combination of both. <br/>
 <br/>
Two side notes: he was completely undiagnosed and no interventions (save for the biomeds - I didn&#39;t know until later what I was doing was what a lot of parents of autism kids were doing) until the age of five and a half. Everyone remarked upon his entry to school at almost age six how well he did. I can only surmise that part of that is b/c he hasn&#39;t been forced since the age of 3 (like a lot of the kids in early intervention). <br/>
 <br/>
second: we were at the park yesterday, and it seems to me that some children can really pick out the ones that &quot;aren&#39;t like them&quot;, and treat them accordingly. Jordie&#39;s idea of making friends is to walk up to somebody and say Hi. See my toy? When he did this yesterday, several young boys began taunting him, and then poking him and one actually slapped him. I was/am appalled and disheartened that I have yet another thing to watch out for. It&#39;s enough to make a gal want to buy five acres in the middle of nowhere and just live. <br/>
 <br/>
I realize that by admitting on a list like this that I may be seen as a not unschooler. I&#39;m okay with that.  Living with a child like Jordie is an extreme challenge. Sometimes I think, so what? Leave him alone, there&#39;s nothing &quot;wrong&quot;! Other times I want to yell at people that he can&#39;t help it, he doesn&#39;t know, he doesn&#39;t understand. So for the OP, I&#39;m sorry. I have no answers. I only have more questions. I understand exactly how you feel. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1778214784">Hi Susan and others,<br/>
I also have a child with autism, specifically PDD-NOS.  He is 9 now (almost <br/>
10) and was dx at age 6.  He was at home until the dx (no preschool), but <br/>
due to moderate communication and motor control issues had speech and OT <br/>
since the age of 3.  After the dx we went through a couple of months not <br/>
knowing what to do.  We also have an 11 yo daughter who has always <br/>
unschooled and we had planned to unschool him also.  However, after the dx <br/>
I got really scared (the so-called professionals will do that to you) and <br/>
we put him in public school.<br/>
<br/>
After three years of school we started unschooling again last summer.  He <br/>
never did learn to read in school.  Though they were working on it and said <br/>
he was starting to read.  I could see at home it was a false assumption. <br/>
 He also hated the reading practice we were supposed to be doing though he <br/>
has loved books and being read to since the age of 5.  I really worried he <br/>
would come to hate books and reading if he stayed in school.  He also still <br/>
can&#39;t count more than about 5 objects without assistance.  They were making <br/>
him do math worksheets for homework and I was basically giving him the <br/>
answers.  I knew that it was ridiculous to expect him to do these things <br/>
when he wasn&#39;t developmentally ready.  Anyway, I hated the schedule, the <br/>
homework and the way he was so angry every afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
Last summer we moved and decided to do some extensive traveling.  He <br/>
learned more in those 5 months than in the whole previous three years and <br/>
also had no therapy at all during that time.  What he did have was his <br/>
family around him at all times and tons of time riding in the RV to play <br/>
and talk with his sister.  That was invaluable!  His pretend play and <br/>
conversations skills really took off.  Well, we are settled in a new home, <br/>
new state now and getting back into regular routines.  I have started <br/>
therapy again, because as he talks more we see all sorts of grammar <br/>
mistakes.  His new therapist is wonderful and supports homeschooling.  She <br/>
is working on real life skills that he just doesn&#39;t seem to be getting even <br/>
with our help.  She also pointed out things he can&#39;t do that we didn&#39;t even <br/>
realize.   So I do think there is a place for therapy, though I think the <br/>
break from therapy was just as valuable.<br/>
<br/>
I am not doing any reading practice or any schooly types of things with <br/>
him, but I read to him everyday.  Ryan&#39;s obsessions mainly center around <br/>
mechanical things, trains, constructions vehicles, vaccuums, all home and <br/>
yard appliances.  So we get lots of books from the library about these <br/>
types of things.  We watch shows that interest him and I take him places <br/>
where they have cool mechanical things like the science museum and the <br/>
logging museum.<br/>
<br/>
He does have some social deficits, but can start a conversation with <br/>
anyone, it&#39;s keeping it going that he has trouble with.  He actually seems <br/>
to be more outgoing than my daughter at places like the park where he&#39;ll <br/>
play with almost anyone.  However, he does not have a best friend, partly <br/>
due to the move but also because he has trouble developing deep <br/>
relationships.  The other kids sometimes reject him due to a weird movement <br/>
or sentence.  He does best with little kids actually.<br/>
<br/>
So here we are at age 9 and 10 months: he is not a reader, he can&#39;t do any <br/>
math at all, he doesn&#39;t understand the value of money, he can write only <br/>
his name.  It can be really scary!  I am trying to keep my trust in him and <br/>
keep reminding myself that lots of unschooled kids can&#39;t read at age 10.  I <br/>
feel that being able to read is something he is capable of and will take a <br/>
few more years.  I can&#39;t wait til it happens so I can write an encouraging <br/>
article about it!  The math seems more worrisome to me actually, though <br/>
I&#39;ve read that math can be a real challenge for many autistic kids.   He <br/>
has just started to get an allowance and I am hoping this will help him <br/>
learn about money and spending.<br/>
<br/>
To Tanya who has the 6 year old with autism.  Ryan sounds similar to your <br/>
son.  He didn&#39;t have any words until after age 3 and then only a few until <br/>
he was at least 4.  He was very unintelligible for years.  He has made tons <br/>
of progress in the last few years with speech, self control and dealing <br/>
with frustration/aggression.   Things will get better.<br/>

I&#39;ve read enough about kids with special challenges, like autism, <br/>

more patience and research with those bigger challenges.<br/>

the basics is not going to help them be more functional adults in <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2056111502">Yes, Ren I have read Anne&#39;s writings.  I love them, but like Susan I have <br/>
felt they are not as helpful (for me) because her son doesn&#39;t have the <br/>
learning challenges that Ryan has.  For instance, you know the homeschool <br/>
saying (something like this), &quot;children learn to talk without instruction, <br/>
it&#39;s the same for everything else.&quot;  Well, my son has needed extensive <br/>
instruction just to be intelligible and it&#39;s still going on.  That&#39;s one <br/>
thing that makes it scarier.  I am truly not so worried about the reading, <br/>
I guess that&#39;s what I was trying to emphasize.  I do wish he could do some <br/>
really basic arithmetic simply because it would be easier to reason with <br/>
him.  He just can&#39;t understand why, when he has $5.00 in his pocket he <br/>
can&#39;t buy the $50.00 toy.  It&#39;s exhausting to do any shopping with him so I <br/>
tend to avoid taking him.  When he does come to the store with me, <br/>
regardless of the store he wants to buy everything.  So there is a real <br/>
reason to want him to have a basic understanding of math.  Also, while I <br/>
don&#39;t expect him to be reading War and Peace some day, I do hope that he <br/>
can read the things that make him happy because he absolutely loves books. <br/>
 Like me and his sister he can spend hours in a bookstore just browsing!<br/>

I think that it might be a combination of both, but after a sensory OT session she is so relaxed, you can see it on her face and hear it in her voice. I think of it as someone getting a massage or something  - it is very comforting to her and she loves it. She is normally kind of tense. One thing I can say is that she had her fingers in her ears consistently from age 2 to 5. We did one session of auditory therapy and THAT AFTERNOON she took her fingers out of her ears and swam and rode her bike for the first time and hasn&#39;t put them in since. It was a pretty obvious connection that time.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve learned alot from the OT about making sure she gets a steady diet of swinging, running, climbing, crunchy foods, slimy toys, etc. that she would not normally go for and I wouldn&#39;t have pushed it otherwise.<br/>

OTOH, it was liberating to get that label, to find out that these things weren&#39;t MY fault (and yes, for some things I really did think it was!). He went to school for three months of last year. He will be going again next year, to an autism specific program in our district. Part of the reason is that I am at a loss. At a loss on how to help him. Hopefully as we continue biomed treatments, we will see more improvements, more self control, and less aggression. I too, am right along with you in questioning the drill drill drill aspect. His teacher from last year says<br/>
that the only way he may be able to learn his &quot;basics&quot; is by rote. Me, I&#39;m wondering - what will happen if we sit back and wait two to three years, to see how he does on his own? OTOH, there is a really good chance with his lack of understanding of anything sequential that by rote may be the only way. Waiting will mean we have lost all that time. Coming from an unschooled and at the least, delayed academic perspective, this is all puzzling to me. To me, basics means tying your shoe, buttoning your own pants, and other daily living and social skills, not counting to ten and saying your ABC&#39;s. Thankfully, the TEACCH program is a combination of both. <br/>
<br/>
Two side notes: he was completely undiagnosed and no interventions (save for the biomeds - I didn&#39;t know until later what I was doing was what a lot of parents of autism kids were doing) until the age of five and a half. Everyone remarked upon his entry to school at almost age six how well he did. I can only surmise that part of that is b/c he hasn&#39;t been forced since the age of 3 (like a lot of the kids in early intervention). <br/>
<br/>
second: we were at the park yesterday, and it seems to me that some children can really pick out the ones that &quot;aren&#39;t like them&quot;, and treat them accordingly. Jordie&#39;s idea of making friends is to walk up to somebody and say Hi. See my toy? When he did this yesterday, several young boys began taunting him, and then poking him and one actually slapped him. I was/am appalled and disheartened that I have yet another thing to watch out for. It&#39;s enough to make a gal want to buy five acres in the middle of nowhere and just live. <br/>
<br/>
I realize that by admitting on a list like this that I may be seen as a not unschooler. I&#39;m okay with that.  Living with a child like Jordie is an extreme challenge. Sometimes I think, so what? Leave him alone, there&#39;s nothing &quot;wrong&quot;! Other times I want to yell at people that he can&#39;t help it, he doesn&#39;t know, he doesn&#39;t understand. So for the OP, I&#39;m sorry. I have no answers. I only have more questions. I understand exactly how you feel. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Susan,<br/>
My son (7) doesn&#39;t have any spectrum issues, but had severe SDI <br/>
(sensory integration dysfunction) and the attendant motor delays and <br/>
visual delays. He also had severe food allergies, and a few other <br/>
issues. He has gone through several courses of therapy over the <br/>
years - OT for the SDI and Visual Therapy, as well as NAET for the <br/>
allergies. Since we&#39;ve always known we wanted to usnchool, it has <br/>
been hard at times to reconcile the unschooling philosophy with the <br/>
ability to help my child through things that do come naturally to <br/>
most kids. Most kids can dress themselves. Most kids eyes work <br/>
together. Most kids can cross their hands over the center line of <br/>
their body when they are writing or drawing. They don&#39;t cover their <br/>
ears or worry about things brushing their skin. I just had yet <br/>
another sunscreen problem today on a homeschool group bike ride. <br/>
We&#39;ve tried everything over the years to deal with the sun issue - <br/>
for a kid who doesn&#39;t like clothes or sunscreen touching their skin, <br/>
how do you go outdoors in the summer? Things have improved greatly <br/>
over the years and with the therapy, but there are still daily issues.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve come to this conclusion: as unschoolers, we try as best we can <br/>
to  help our kids to learn/do the things they want to do. That might <br/>
mean telling them how to spell a word, looking up something on the <br/>
internet, driving them to the library, etc. For us, the therapies he <br/>
has gone through have helped him do things (&quot;normal&quot; things) that he <br/>
has wanted to do - things like dress himself, see a movie in a <br/>
theatre, or draw something he wants to draw. Just helping him remove <br/>
the roadblocks in his life is, I think, still compatible with <br/>
unschooling, although there are those who will dismiss any therapy <br/>
as &quot;unneeded&quot; and as opposed to unschooling. Also, we look for <br/>
therapies that are compatible with our unschooling lifestyle, and <br/>
therapists who will not start pushing school agendas. So far, it has <br/>
worked out okay.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck to you. There is no easy road when parenting a kid with <br/>
challenging issues, but I think unschooling is a real gift for these <br/>
kids who often struggle so hard, both academically and socially if <br/>
they are in schools. Just having the time to progress in their own <br/>
way and pace, and the time with patient and loving parents is, IMHO, <br/>
a godsend.<br/>

<br/>
This is outrageous. Unfortunately this kind of thing happens more than it<br/>
should, when the Lord of the Flies mentality takes over a group of kids -<br/>
especially when the parents are usually over-controlling and then turn away<br/>
for some reason.<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion to you is to find a local inclusive homeschool support group<br/>
that has park days, or start one. My experience of the kids in my local<br/>
group is much greater acceptance of difference and a fluidity in who is<br/>
playing with whom each week, as well as some long term games. What happens<br/>
in our group is that the parents maintain an awareness of what is happening<br/>
without constantly bossing and mediating the kids&#39; interactions, but are<br/>
right there to address any conflicts. Most of the time the children come up<br/>
and express that they need help with some accident or conflict of goals.<br/>
<br/>
BTW in our group we rotate through several parks each month, and<br/>
deliberately choose parks that are not frequented by hordes of nannies or<br/>
day camps in summer. This is to avoid crowds on the equipment, and to allow<br/>
our children to enhance their relationships with each other rather than<br/>
random strangers. In Jayn&#39;s case, we have been going to the main park day<br/>
less regularly, because that latter function especially is being fulfilled<br/>
by our attendance at an informal park day after dance class, that is<br/>
attended by nearly all her homeschooler friends.<br/>

That&#39;s where we were. Park day. not really super organized, but a friend knows a friend who also has a friend who homeschool (I do mean homeschool lol). There was another group there that day as well, a church mom and me group. I have no idea of those kids were part of that group or not. I just felt like, well, damn. I don&#39;t have enough eyes for all of this!! <br/>
