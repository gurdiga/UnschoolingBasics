<div id="ygrps-yiv-1821760218">Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
My ds16 wants to study Greek and Latin.  There used to be a way to get <br/>
Rosetta Stone through an online membership to the Chattanooga Library <br/>
but apparently Rosetta Stone has canceled their contract with the <br/>
library.  Does anyone know another way to get it online?  <br/>
Or, does anyone have any other suggestions for other ways to study <br/>
languages?  My son really likes learning with an interactive online <br/>
program.<br/>
<br/>
My dd11, loves anything French and she wants to learn to speak the <br/>
language as well. I can&#39;t afford to buy all the programs necessary to <br/>
fit all their needs so any help is much appreciated!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1045575249">Maybe try this website: www.lingq.com. It was set up by a man, Steve  <br/>
Kaufmann,  who began to teach himself various languages as he needed  <br/>
them. I heard him interviewed on CBC radio. You may be able to find a  <br/>
podcast of the program, I think it was &quot;C&#39;est la vie&quot;, but I don&#39;t  <br/>
remember the date. You can learn various languages via this website  <br/>
(including French) and the initial account sign up is free. There are  <br/>
different levels (I think of intensity rather than fluency) for a fee.  <br/>
I keep thinking I&#39;d like to try it myself, but I&#39;ve yet to make the  <br/>
time. Here is a quote from lingq.com:<br/>
<br/>
Everyone is capable of becoming fluent in a second or third or ninth  <br/>
language! I will show you how to unlock the ability all humans possess  <br/>
to communicate in whatever language they choose. My system works! I  <br/>
have proven it and our LingQ Members continue to prove it every day.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have a magic potion or a secret formula but I have developed  <br/>
the most efficient way to learn languages and it doesn&#39;t include  <br/>
classrooms and memorizing grammar rules. All you need is the desire to  <br/>
communicate and the right system. The LingQ system!<br/>
<br/>
Kaufmann also has a book, The way of the linguist<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please, let me know if you or your ds or dd try it. I&#39;d be interested  <br/>
to see what they think.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1418334756">My now 16yos did language tapes/CD from the Library for a few years<br/>
before taking French at the local community college at 14.<br/>
Pimsleur was his favorite if I remember.<br/>
He is taking his 3rd semester this year and loving it.<br/>
We also enjoyed listening to movies in French!<br/>
Our next plan is to send him to Canada or France for a REAL immersion <br/>
adventure.<br/>
Any unschoolers want to host him?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry can&#39;t help with the on-line stuff.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-959987118">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I just remembered listening to some language clips on youtube before.<br/>
Numbers, greetings, basic phrases must be plenty there, for almost any language.<br/>
I did some japanese numbers while reading my mails, for example.<br/>
Probably not the way to perfect bilingualism, but an easily accessible starting point.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi.  I just wanted to toss out this as a fantastic way to study Greek.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Reading-Greek-Text-">http://www.amazon.com/Reading-Greek-Text-</a><br/>
Vocabulary/dp/0521698510/ref=sr_1_23?<br/>

<br/>
The Reading Greek book and the Grammar book that goes with it are <br/>
excellent.  We used those books when I was learning Greek in graduate <br/>
school and they&#39;re really nice.  The premise is that you learn to <br/>
read Greek by doing translations of simplified texts, not by <br/>
memorizing verbs and declensions and grammar.  So you translate small <br/>
passages (with helpful vocabulary provided) and then for each <br/>
translation passage you have associated grammar in the other book.  <br/>
<br/>
Since there&#39;s no real reason to speak classic Greek, this method is <br/>
excellent for learning how to read Greek.  It seems to me that it <br/>
would be even better for a self-learner, since translating the <br/>
passages of text provides so much more pleasure than the other <br/>
methods of learning a language.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1497873397">I have very very limited skills in Romanian and Spanish and one thing that is helpful for me is to listen to books on tape, while following along in English.  Also, another thing I found helpful is watching a movie that has been dubbed with English subtitles, or in listen in English with subtitles in another language.  Very low cost, but fun and very useful.  It won&#39;t work as well for Greek or Latin but French subtitles are common.  I do know that Romanian is VERY similar to Latin, but it is not a very widespread language so you really have to hunt to find things in it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-223144934">These are all excellent suggestions, thank you.  I did go on the Ling site and we will sign up for that for French.  I studied Italian in college and I wouldn&#39;t mind doing a bit of that as well.  We&#39;ll let you know how it is.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, I will order the Greek book because I think my ds would love to translate!<br/>
<br/>
thanks everyone!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1927776162">Thanks for the feedback. You might also try itunes University. I was  <br/>
looking at this site for other reasons and it seems to have material  <br/>
on a wide variety of subjects (Language, Business, Science etc.) from  <br/>
a variety of sources (including Yale). I looked at language on your  <br/>
behalf and I see there is at least one free text on Elementary Greek  <br/>
Grammar: www.apple.com/education/itunesu_mobilelearning/itunesu.html<br/>
