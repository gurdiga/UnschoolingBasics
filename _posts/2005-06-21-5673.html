<div id="ygrps-yiv-931010256">&quot;A rather brilliant commentary on health & healing....  bound to promote some<br/>
interesting discussion with our kids... &quot;<br/>
<br/>
While I have no problem with the sharing of topics you found interesting in your home, I would prefer a link to it, not the entire commentary unless it&#39;s on the topic of unschooling. <br/>
We have a lot of different views here about subjects like health care, religion etc...and I do enjoy hearing what interests everyone, but I want to keep the list focused on the topic of unschooling please.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for understanding.:)<br/>
