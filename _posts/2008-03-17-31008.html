<div id="ygrps-yiv-58216588">My 15 yr old son has been very interested in music since he was about <br/>
11. He began by exploring on his own, listening, playing with tab and by <br/>
ear, and has had various lessons and experiences of an informal nature <br/>
until last summer. We live in a small college town. He mainly plays <br/>
upright and electric bass and there arelimited options for mentors on <br/>
the upright bass. One college has a reputable music department and the <br/>
professor of bass there agreed to take on my son as a regular student.  <br/>
He is a very interesting person, a composer/performer across genres, and <br/>
teaches a method that emphasizes ergonomics and comfort to extend the <br/>
range and improve sound quality. I think we are all a bit in awe of <br/>
him.  He treats my son as he does the undergrads he teaches- he expects <br/>
a lot and pushes him to perfect technique. My son has said he will do <br/>
anything that this teacher says- I think because he really wants to play <br/>
as well as possible and has a lot of respect for this teacher&#39;s ability <br/>
to help him do that. They work on a lot of theory and writing and <br/>
playing jazz lines, transcribing, as well as scales and working at what <br/>
seems like high speed through a series that emphasizes classical pieces. <br/>
My son enjoys a lot of it but some of it has become what seems like <br/>
work. He sets aside at least a couple of hours a day for preparing for <br/>
these lessons 5 days a week plus a day for a lesson. In addition he <br/>
plays keyboard and acoustic guitar and electric guitar &quot;informally&quot; and <br/>
performs with various groups with other young people both independently <br/>
and with the local high school. This weekend we heard him singing in his <br/>
room- one of his bands needs a singer and he has decided to give it a <br/>
try. It is pretty exciting to be a witness to his journey- and it is <br/>
pure joy listening to him play.<br/>
<br/>
However, I feel like we are entering upon dangerous territory where his <br/>
own desires might get confused with those of his teacher and other <br/>
adults. The teacher suggested that he play in a youth orchestra- which <br/>
involves an hour drive each way once a week every Sunday. He prefers to <br/>
play jazz, funk, rock, and listens to a lot of hip hop. The classical <br/>
pieces are challenging for him but he doesn&#39;t really usually enjoy <br/>
classical music to listen to. He is thinking about it. He has taken on <br/>
other large commitments to perform and then felt really bored with all <br/>
the rehearsals- most recently with the high school musical. The music <br/>
was not challenging enough or of a type he prefers- anyway he had made <br/>
the decision and then regretted it but the consequences of quitting <br/>
weren&#39;t desirable either.<br/>
<br/>
I am feeling a little worried about maintaining the absolute that this <br/>
is about our son and what he wants rather than trying to please this <br/>
teacher and other adults involved. I often remind my husband of this. I <br/>
trust my son to let us know when/if he is ready to make a change but I <br/>
guess I am just nervous as it seems so schooly. Several kids he plays <br/>
with are seniors in high school and there is a LOT of talk about music <br/>
schools- many of them are finding out which schools they are getting <br/>
into. I fear that he will get swept along and then find out later that <br/>
it is not for him- though I guess that would be okay and he would <br/>
survive that. That certainly is what happened to me- college was <br/>
miserable experience in which I felt I had no choice- was in abusive <br/>
relationship and made it through by the skin of my teeth- not at all <br/>
joyful- though I have been able to come back to the same field and do <br/>
enjoy it now. I do remind him that he always has the choice to stop or <br/>
change - which sometimes makes him mad- maybe it insults his <br/>
intelligence. It is just that I didn&#39;t know I had a choice at that age <br/>
and it is new to me to be going through this stage with him- of getting <br/>
serious about a possible life direction and being very affected by the <br/>
predetermined path that exists out there. It is like a big magnet- very <br/>
attractive in many ways- but not the only way though those involved may <br/>
think so.<br/>
<br/>
Is is a challenge for me to stay here and now and not get excited about <br/>
possibilities for the future- and to know how much to seek out <br/>
opportunities. He may prefer opportunities which are more difficult to <br/>
find in a small town - there are certain mainstream things that are <br/>
easily accessible. What he really LOVED most of all was playing with a <br/>
jazz/funk group of high school kids - he was asked to substitute <br/>
recently when the bass player was on vacation. Networking is not always <br/>
easy for him- he is younger than most of the musicians he enjoys playing <br/>
with and that he feels are at his level of commitment and proficiency- <br/>
so a social aspect enters into it- he doesn&#39;t feel comfortable taking <br/>
initiative. It is easy just to show up at an audition that is arranged <br/>
by an adult and play. It is much &#39;easier&#39; for me to register him for an <br/>
orchestra audition that to support him in creating a small group playing <br/>
music he loves- though I certainly will and can do both or either.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway- does anyone have any thoughts or have had any similar <br/>
experiences that would be able to offer any suggestions? I guess I just <br/>
want to be held accountable to radical unschooling principles on this so <br/>
please point out anything that seems strange in my thinking. I fear that <br/>
I am being swept away- we get SO much positive feedback about his music <br/>
and I feel so happy about it and so proud and excited for him that I <br/>
fear my ability to maintain sanity especially in contact with the <br/>
insanity of other adults. Also I hang back from fully embracing a <br/>
mainstream path.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-975774217">Heather, I had written a really l-o-n-g response to this ---all about <br/>
Cameron&#39;s musical career and all the doors opened for him and all the <br/>
lessons learned---ugh!---and was suddenly kicked off the server right <br/>
before I was going to hit send.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry!<br/>
<br/>
I will tell you that I was in a similar boat. Cameron played drums.<br/>
<br/>
His interest has now waned, but (as with all of Cameron&#39;s passions! <br/>
&lt;G&gt;) it was ALL-CONSUMING at one time. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We assumed (as we have with all of his passions) that this would <br/>
probably be his career. Doesn&#39;t look like it now. Maybe his new <br/>
backpacking/camping passion will be his career. &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
*I* ALWAYS get excited about Cam&#39;s future. It always looks so cool! &lt;g&gt; <br/>
Magic, film-making. drumming---now outdoor leadership----it all looks <br/>
cool!<br/>
<br/>
But time passes really, really quickly, and it won&#39;t be long before <br/>
he&#39;s NOT the youngest one there. By the time he&#39;s 18, there&#39;ll be <br/>
another 15 year old impressing the socks off everyone!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway....I think that, if he *knows* he can stop at any time, he&#39;ll be <br/>
fine. I&#39;d let him pursue as long and as hard as he wants to. He may <br/>
make a few wrong turns and bad decisions, but each one will be a good <br/>
learning-take. As long as he knows you&#39;re right there, it&#39;ll be fine.<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s ever near SC, we&#39;d love to have him come jam!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1318538185">Yes, though I know like I am he is very swayed by other&#39;s opinions. <br/>
Though having conversations with him about it usually helps him find <br/>
himself in the midst of this. Doing what I thought I should or taking <br/>
the opinions of others too seriously has gotten me into a lot of bad <br/>
places in my life. I fear for him is this way though I know in the end <br/>
he is strong enough to make his own decision- as I always am, too!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1502898862">This is great, Kelly. It really helps put it in perspective. We can get <br/>
a little dizzy sometimes- fun dizzy - but I want to be careful to stay <br/>
in the present, too.<br/>
<br/>
Last year my son was considering going on tour playing at Magic <br/>
tournaments as a career option but now is hardly playing at all. He <br/>
wants to spend his money on other things.<br/>
<br/>
It is fun to speculate about his future- his dad especially tends to go <br/>
in that direction. I find myself often trying to de-emphasize that <br/>
aspect in the household and leave it to my son to take the lead with <br/>
those ideas. Not everything has to go somewhere- not every thought or <br/>
action has some greater purpose - or not one we can see, anyway. My <br/>
husband seems to create his own picture of what should be happening or <br/>
what the best path is that to me is totally confusing and besides the <br/>
point. I want to enjoy what is going on now and give my son the space to <br/>
do that too. It does seem natural for him to see what others are doing <br/>
and to try on different ideas- to go in one direction or another for a <br/>
awhile. Right now it is music school. We went to a faculty recital at <br/>
the college at which his teacher played with the trumpet professor - <br/>
also some graduates of the music program. Pretty interesting view of <br/>
academia and graduates who are finding their way doing various things. <br/>
Lots ways to go even with the field of music. We have a lot of different <br/>
examples- have local musician friends who make a living at performing, <br/>
recording, and teaching outside the university system as well. One <br/>
friend is planning to major in drums and music therapy- wow!<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is making a whole lot of little fuzzy stuffed bears right <br/>
now- another adult asked her what the purpose was yesterday- what she <br/>
will do with them. She is just having so much fun making them that she <br/>
wants to keep doing it! Doesn&#39;t need a purpose- that is hard for many <br/>
adults to understand.<br/>
<br/>
I am enjoying myself so much doing things that are just about doing <br/>
them- without it having to go somewhere- when I make things people are <br/>
always asking me if I am going to sell them. Maybe I&#39;ll just have a <br/>
million, or just give them away one day when I want to make space for a <br/>
new project!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2035440537">I&#39;m rather new to unschooling. I was a musician for years, with both <br/>
the love of it, and the history of being pushed into it. One thought, <br/>
that I hope is radical unschooly enough -<br/>
<br/>
I hear that your son might being being pushed by his teacher to do <br/>
something the teacher has some designs on, rather than what might be <br/>
best for your son. Your son is in a pretty heady place, being so <br/>
talented, with older and professional musicians seeing his talent. <br/>
There is much to be learned by crossing genre&#39;s. This could be part <br/>
of the attraction of the orchestral gig, and the attraction of this <br/>
teacher. I wonder if you can talk with your son and help him explore <br/>
why he wants to do the orchestral gig; help him think through the <br/>
pros and cons. I think of it as helping him (and you) get grounded. <br/>
And I think of it as your being a choice-coach, or an agent (like a <br/>
true musician&#39;s agent), helping his find his clarity, which can be <br/>
obscured in these heady, teenage times. Going on a search for truth <br/>
in the (joyful) jungle of positive feedback, pride, desire, love of <br/>
music, excitement, social pulls, ...<br/>

Congratulations for raising such a remarkable son.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>and <br/>

 </span></blockquote>independently <br/>

 </span></blockquote>in his <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; room- one of his bands needs a singer and he has decided to give it <br/>
 </span></blockquote>a <br/>

 </span></blockquote>his <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; own desires might get confused with those of his teacher and other <br/>
&gt; adults. The teacher suggested that he play in a youth orchestra- <br/>
 </span></blockquote>which <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; involves an hour drive each way once a week every Sunday. He <br/>
 </span></blockquote>prefers to <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; play jazz, funk, rock, and listens to a lot of hip hop. The <br/>
 </span></blockquote>classical <br/>

 </span></blockquote>all <br/>

 </span></blockquote>music <br/>

 </span></blockquote>made <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the decision and then regretted it but the consequences of quitting <br/>

 </span></blockquote>but I <br/>

 </span></blockquote>music <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; schools- many of them are finding out which schools they are <br/>

 </span></blockquote>that <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; it is not for him- though I guess that would be okay and he would <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; joyful- though I have been able to come back to the same field and <br/>
 </span></blockquote>do <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; enjoy it now. I do remind him that he always has the choice to stop <br/>
 </span></blockquote>or <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; change - which sometimes makes him mad- maybe it insults his <br/>
&gt; intelligence. It is just that I didn&#39;t know I had a choice at that <br/>
 </span></blockquote>age <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and it is new to me to be going through this stage with him- of <br/>
 </span></blockquote>getting <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; serious about a possible life direction and being very affected by <br/>
 </span></blockquote>the <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; predetermined path that exists out there. It is like a big magnet- <br/>
 </span></blockquote>very <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; attractive in many ways- but not the only way though those involved <br/>
 </span></blockquote>may <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; think so.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is is a challenge for me to stay here and now and not get excited <br/>
 </span></blockquote>about <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; possibilities for the future- and to know how much to seek out <br/>
&gt; opportunities. He may prefer opportunities which are more difficult <br/>
 </span></blockquote>to <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; find in a small town - there are certain mainstream things that are <br/>
&gt; easily accessible. What he really LOVED most of all was playing <br/>
 </span></blockquote>with a <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; jazz/funk group of high school kids - he was asked to substitute <br/>
&gt; recently when the bass player was on vacation. Networking is not <br/>
 </span></blockquote>always <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; easy for him- he is younger than most of the musicians he enjoys <br/>
 </span></blockquote>playing <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; with and that he feels are at his level of commitment and <br/>
 </span></blockquote>proficiency- <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; so a social aspect enters into it- he doesn&#39;t feel comfortable <br/>
 </span></blockquote>taking <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; initiative. It is easy just to show up at an audition that is <br/>
 </span></blockquote>arranged <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; by an adult and play. It is much &#39;easier&#39; for me to register him <br/>
 </span></blockquote>for an <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; orchestra audition that to support him in creating a small group <br/>
 </span></blockquote>playing <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; music he loves- though I certainly will and can do both or either.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway- does anyone have any thoughts or have had any similar <br/>

 </span></blockquote>just <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; want to be held accountable to radical unschooling principles on <br/>
 </span></blockquote>this so <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; please point out anything that seems strange in my thinking. I fear <br/>
 </span></blockquote>that <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am being swept away- we get SO much positive feedback about his <br/>
 </span></blockquote>music <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and I feel so happy about it and so proud and excited for him that <br/>
