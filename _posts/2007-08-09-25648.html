<div id="ygrps-yiv-1489918385">OK so I wrote here a while back because we were supposed to be moving <br/>
to NE and after I was all squared away for schooling there we find out <br/>
those orders were pulled and now we are moving back to CA.  Last time <br/>
we were there in Lemoore we loved it but our son was less than a year <br/>
old so we obviously didn&#39;t have to worry about the laws lol  <br/>
So I was wondering if anyone out there is/has dealt with the CA <br/>
system?  Any pointers?  I have read through the laws several times ad I <br/>
think I understand them but dh and I will have to talk when he gets <br/>
home next week.  I&#39;d really appreciate any advice :)<br/>

Thanks I thought that was all I&#39;d have to do :)  we still won&#39;t move <br/>
till mid-late Nov but i just want to get everything figured out so this <br/>
transition can be as easy as possible (1st move with our daughter and <br/>
only the 2nd with our son) because something always seems to go wrong <br/>
with a military move lol<br/>

I set up a private school type thing, but I didn&#39;t really need to, as  Julian <br/>
would be starting Kindergarten this year and so far, that&#39;s not mandatory  in <br/>
this state. Where are you located? I&#39;m in Claremont...<br/>
