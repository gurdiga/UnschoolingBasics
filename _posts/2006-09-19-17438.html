<div id="ygrps-yiv-575450744">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I am the mother of a 2.75 year old boy in the rural area outside<br/>
Athens, LA (about an hour east of Shreveport, LA). I am interested in<br/>
unschooling, but as it is new to me I can&#39;t say that I understand it<br/>
all completely.<br/>
<br/>
I would also love to hear what others do with their almost 3 year<br/>
olds. I am having trouble with giving him opportunities without<br/>
everything getting destroyed and my husband freaking out because he<br/>
can&#39;t walk through our small house without stepping on something. My<br/>
son also wants someone to do most things with him. It is hard for me<br/>
to get involved without getting in his way.<br/>
<br/>
We read, play games, do puzzles, use play-doh, use art materials,<br/>
build with blocks, watch some videos, he helps with or watches food<br/>
prep, and other stuff I can&#39;t remember right now. He loves balls<br/>
(especially small ones), things with wheels or things that roll,<br/>
collections of little things, water (especially pouring it on the<br/>
floor), and dancing around and singing songs with silly words. He just<br/>
started inventing stories to go along with his toys. He speaks very<br/>
clearly, has a large vocabulary and is interested in learning to read<br/>
and write, so we informally do stuff related to that.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have kids who are learning piano with a computer program<br/>
or DVD? I would like to learn and my son may join in as well.<br/>
<br/>
I recently tried to enroll him in a ballet class. They would like the<br/>
parents to leave them alone after the second class and he is not ready<br/>
for that, so we will probably get some videos from the library again<br/>
that he can watch if he likes. The only way he will be going to the<br/>
ballet class is if they start one for kids who don&#39;t want to leave<br/>
their parents, as I suggested. The class he was in was over-crowded<br/>
anyway.<br/>
<br/>
My son has a lot of fears, especially of sounds and darkness. I have<br/>
trouble getting my son to go outside. He seems to be very sensitive to<br/>
the sounds we hear out there. Like cicadas, cows, trucks, crows, etc.<br/>
When we are outside we walk around, play in the dirt, find and name<br/>
plants, pick things from the garden, throw/hit balls, play with<br/>
sand/water, take him on bike rides, and whatever else we can find. My<br/>
husband&#39;s parents live 500 feet away and he ALWAYS wants to go to<br/>
their house. I have trouble keeping at home actually. They except his<br/>
visits, but at the same time they get exhausted and complain about<br/>
being tired.<br/>
<br/>
We have recently been trying to get together with other homeschoolers<br/>
in Northern Louisiana, since I just started identifying myself as a<br/>
homeschooler. We have made a few friends so far, but I would say that<br/>
that are not into unschooling at this time. Though most people with<br/>
preschoolers are not terrible structured, nor have they completely<br/>
figured out what method they with use (like me).<br/>
<br/>
We have always practiced some level of attachment parenting.<br/>
Breastfeeding, baby wearing, co-sleeping, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
talia</div>

<br/>
**I&#39;ve only been &quot;getting&quot; unschooling since April of this year (my son is <br/>
2.5) and it really sounds like you&#39;ve got the hang of just enjoying life <br/>
with your little guy. I wish you lived closer to Los Angeles because it <br/>
sounds like the boys would really enjoy hanging out together. My son sounds <br/>
exactly like yours - loves all the same things: cars, trucks, balls, water, <br/>
cooking, play-doh, etc. He always wants me to play with him, too, and I do <br/>
for the most part. Sometimes when I am &quot;played out&quot; I have explained that to <br/>
him but tell him that I&#39;m happy to sit beside him while he plays (I&#39;ll <br/>
sometimes knit or just sit and drink coffee while he&#39;s playing). He likes <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you are giving him opportunities already but maybe there is a <br/>
time before your husband comes home where you can do a quick pick-up (at <br/>
least clear a path). When my son is feeling particularly messy, I&#39;ll suggest <br/>
we take all the messy things outside (any crafts, painting, play-doh, etc., <br/>
we do outside so I can just hose things down) or we&#39;ll play in the bathtub. <br/>
Right now I&#39;m doing a few outdoor landscaping projects in our yard so he&#39;s <br/>
right there beside me with his little shovel or spade and helping dig dirt <br/>
or pull weeds, pick up leaves, cut leaves, etc. He loves that and is making <br/>
connections with what Bob the Builder does and what mommy is doing. He&#39;ll <br/>
dig some dirt and say, &quot;whew - that&#39;s really hard work!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, I&#39;m still getting used to this unschooling thing, but it feels <br/>
right and I&#39;m always looking for new things to offer my son. If he&#39;s not <br/>
feeling up to it, he tells me and I&#39;ll offer something else. This weekend <br/>
we&#39;re planning on going to the L.A. county fair. Today we went to the <br/>
arboretum and fed all the peacocks and geese that roam freely there. I can&#39;t <br/>
imagine making him go to preschool and miss all this life together...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1552645731">Hi Laura,<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the group.  I&#39;m new to unschooling and have<br/>
two kids- Tyler 11 and Alexandra 9.  We are still in<br/>
the process of deschooling, since I just took the kids<br/>
out of school at the end of the year.  Since<br/>
unschooling, the kids are doing great, and we&#39;ve had a<br/>
whole attitude shift.  They are happier now than they<br/>
have ever been.  Even my husband, who wasn&#39;t so<br/>
convinced on the deschooling thing, has noticed that<br/>
they are learning, and doing alot better.<br/>
<br/>
We do alot of shopping, some gardening, lots of<br/>
cooking, and playing, and reading.  Since unschooling,<br/>
I&#39;ve found that we are able to enjoy life more, and<br/>
learn about things that aren&#39;t dictated by the public<br/>
schools.  Even relatives have noticed the positive<br/>
changes in my kids.  We also experimented on ways to<br/>
make a penny shiney again.  We tried all sorts of<br/>
things, and found that taco sauce works really good. <br/>
(I got that idea from another poster, I think in this<br/>
group.)<br/>
<br/>
Again, welcome, and enjoy your kids!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Vanessa<br/>

Good to see you over here Laura!!<br/>
Once you join, you&#39;re an active member who should receive emails but<br/>
Yahoo is entirely unpredictable at times. I checked your account and<br/>
it&#39;s set to receive individual emails so you should be getting a full<br/>
inbox shortly.<br/>
If the individuals are too much, you can always switch to digest<br/>
format, which has a bunch of posts in one email and doesn&#39;t clog up<br/>
your inbox so fast.:)<br/>
<br/>
Glad you joined.<br/>

My other daughter (also adopted) has Asperger&#39;s and Sensory Processing Disorder.  What is NLD?  Non Verbal Learning Disability?  I am new to Unschooling, but am finding ways to make it work with my AS/SPD child.  How long have you been Unschooling your 14 year old?  Now you say he does not want to do much of anything, but what are the things he is doing?  What does he like to do?  Does he have any passions?  I know a lot of people here do not like the ADHD labels and such, so I&#39;m not sure what kind of responses you will get.  I know for us it&#39;s not that I like to label my daughter with Asperger&#39;s or Sensory Processing Disorder, but it&#39;s really the only way I can explain her.  Lot&#39;s of people don&#39;t understand her behavior and her huge lack of social skills, and by explaining that she has AS/SPD is the only way I can make people understand.  Anyway I got off track.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Video games are how my son (now 8.5) learned to read.  It was out of<br/>
necessity because his sisters refused to continue reading all the<br/>
directions and character speech bubbles to him.  In order to play the<br/>
games he learned to read.  He reads some amazing words and is<br/>
undaunted by anything put in front of him.  Your son may be doing more<br/>
reading than you expect, but it may not be in the form of books.  What<br/>
are you strewing in his path?  Many of the role playing games have<br/>
corresponding novels and/or manga associated with them.  There are<br/>
tons of books, instruction videos, and computer programs that talk<br/>
about the art of video games and anime, how to draw characters, how to<br/>
program video games, etc.  There are clubs formed for gamers.  Maybe<br/>
he could get a job at a local EB Games or Game Stop or other used<br/>
gaming store where he could expand his interest into other areas of<br/>
the gaming world.  I have a friend who lives in Canada whose husband<br/>
is a gaming programmer and has worked on some big name games.  I wish<br/>
we lived closer because I have 3 kids who would love a tour of where<br/>
he works (they are homeschoolers as well and could accomodate) so<br/>
maybe there is someone around you doing something similar.<br/>
<br/>
His passions aren&#39;t &quot;just&quot; playing outside and gaming.  HIs passions<br/>
*are* playing outside and gaming.  Expand on that.  Strew like crazy<br/>
for him.  Find opportunities for him.  He may decline them (maybe even<br/>
just at first if this is something new you haven&#39;t done).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-411757555">Karen, we can&#39;t really know how things are at your house with the <br/>
limited description, but when you say he is reading at a 2nd grade <br/>
level, the first thing that I imagined is him being given books made <br/>
for little kids.  Like I said, I don&#39;t know, but I hope he has some <br/>
more interesting reading material.  Does he read stuff on his video <br/>
games?  On the computer?<br/>
<br/>
When you say that you have purchased games and cds and such, what <br/>
types of things are these?  Are they for teaching reading?  If so, <br/>
that could be a problem.  Maybe if you give us some more details, we <br/>
could give some suggestions.<br/>

&gt; Karen, we can&#39;t really know how things are at your house with the <br/>
&gt; limited description, but when you say he is reading at a 2nd grade <br/>
&gt; level, the first thing that I imagined is him being given books made <br/>
&gt;Christy<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We have quite literally, hundreds of books of all genre and age, <br/>
Reading is my husband and my favorite past time. I have many childrens <br/>
books on cd (stories told by jim weiss) I have reading blasters, math <br/>
blasters, I have rainbow rock,numbermaze challenge.the quarter mile <br/>
math,memory challenge (critical thinking co.)ranger trail and <br/>
hurricane havoc(fisher price)I spy, outnumbered,big job, carmen <br/>
sandiego,spy masters,treasure mountain (these are all computer <br/>
software) I also have numerous curriculums that we have tried. When he <br/>
does do anything, I sit with him(this he likes, he like me to be near <br/>
him, I try to sit with him the majority of the time he is playing his <br/>
video games. Thanks in advance to all who are trying to help. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I only have a moment but I think it&#39;s important to note that he isn&#39;t  <br/>
at &quot;2nd grade level&quot; because he began reading last year. Kids who  <br/>
begin reading at 14 are reading at age level within a few months and  <br/>
are indistinguishable from kids who started reading at 6.<br/>
<br/>
Something *else* besides starting late is keeping him from reading  <br/>
well. Primarily it might be because he doesn&#39;t read much. Which isn&#39;t  <br/>
a reason to force him to read, of course! It&#39;s just a fact.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe, rather than looking at where you&#39;d like to get him (reading,  <br/>
math, etc) look at what he loves to do and help him do that. Because  <br/>
everything connects to everything else. Help him explore outside.  <br/>
Help him explore games to their fullest extent. Do introduce other  <br/>
things you think he&#39;d like, but don&#39;t get trapped into the mindset of  <br/>
introducing things that would be good for him or would &quot;help&quot; him.<br/>
<br/>
Work with him rather than working on him.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Really?  How do you know he is on a 2nd grade reading level? What does<br/>
2nd grade look like?  Maybe he just doesn&#39;t enjoy reading so only<br/>
reads that which he needs to in order to get by.  I know it is hard<br/>
for the bibliophile (I&#39;m one) to understand, but some people just<br/>
don&#39;t enjoy reading!  Your son may be one of those.  And, having<br/>
worked in a bookstore, I see what many 9 and 8 year olds are reading<br/>
and they aren&#39;t picture books.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;in math, all he can do is single digit<br/>
&gt; addition and single digit subtraction,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Buy him a calculator not more math programs.  When he is ready and<br/>
when he sees a need he will learn more math.  In the meantime strew<br/>
his interests in front of him. Provide him opportunities to expand his<br/>
interests, but don&#39;t force him into those opportunities.<br/>
<br/>
I know you said that you unschooled your older child, but I wonder if<br/>
you have a false sense of what unschooling is.  I would hazard to<br/>
guess that your older child had interests that were more in line with<br/>
what you felt were important subjects to learn (math and reading<br/>
particularly).  Your son may have a broader understanding than you are<br/>
giving him credit for, it just doesn&#39;t look like &quot;learning&quot; as you<br/>
have qualified it.<br/>
