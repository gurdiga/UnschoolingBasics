<div id="ygrps-yiv-497017199">I thought I posted this, but when I checked, I didn&#39;t find it.<br/>
<br/>
My 3 1/2yo son is very talkative (he had 200 words by 15 months old). <br/>
I&#39;m slightly more introverted than extraverted and do not talk much <br/>
at all. My son repeats himself until I respond, which usually means I <br/>
have to repeat what he says. He often wants me to make up what the <br/>
characters in his books and in his play say to him, to me or to <br/>
eachother. I can go along with this for a while, but then I feel like <br/>
my brain starts hurting and I just want quiet time away from him. <br/>
<br/>
Other things about my son that have been hard for me: very demanding, <br/>
very energetic, doesn&#39;t sleep well, easily overwhelmed by his <br/>
feelings if things aren&#39;t going his way (will often end up vomiting).<br/>
<br/>
I have heard other SAHMs say that the time they spend with their kids <br/>
is better when they have time away from them (the kids are in <br/>
daycare, with a nanny, in some sort of school program...). I wonder <br/>
if this would be true for me and if I could find a good program that <br/>
would nurture my son or is there a better way to deal with <br/>
my &quot;problem&quot; that is more in line with unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
One answer I would come up with is to have him spend time with other <br/>
unschooling families while I go do my own thing, but now that we are <br/>
living in Switzerland, I have no other unschooling families around <br/>
me. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi, Jolene. I know exactly how you feel, although my children are a<br/>
bit older than yours now (two girls, ages 9 and 12). I am not a big<br/>
talker and don&#39;t like talking a lot, although I certainly make the<br/>
effort to answer the girls questions and talk to them as much as<br/>
possible. I do need my quiet time every day, or I will get stressed<br/>
out, and that&#39;s when I know I&#39;m in danger of &quot;losing my cool.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Do you have a husband who will take your son for an hour or two at<br/>
night? Can you leave your son with a grandparent or other family<br/>
member now and then? Look for local homeschooling groups in your area,<br/>
even if they are not unschooling groups, and make friends with other<br/>
families who have children your son&#39;s age. I find that&#39;s one of my<br/>
greatest sources of down time -- trading &quot;play dates&quot; with friends,<br/>
and thereby giving the adults turns at down time.<br/>
<br/>
I know TV can be a touchy issue, but will your son sit and watch a<br/>
show for 20 minutes? Does he like computer games? Are there any other<br/>
things that you might be able to find to entertain him for a few<br/>
minutes at a time so that you can get a small breather? Take that time<br/>
to close your eyes and listen to the silence, get refreshed, relax.<br/>
Hopefully when your son comes back to you, talking a mile a minute,<br/>
you&#39;ll feel re-energized and able to give him what he needs again.<br/>
<br/>
My older daughter enjoys quiet and solitude, but my younger one wants<br/>
a constant source of entertainment. She doesn&#39;t like to be alone or to<br/>
do things alone. She will watch movies by herself, however, or play<br/>
games on the computer (because she has something outside herself to<br/>
interact with). I know 3 and a half may be young for that, but<br/>
anything that he might enjoy doing by himself would help you get some<br/>
down time. I know it&#39;s tough! Good luck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1132065424">Thanks for the encouragement. I&#39;m realizing more and more as I read <br/>
people&#39;s suggestions that this only became a problem for me during <br/>
pregnancy. I seem to have pretty short circuit&#39;s now and need a lot <br/>
more time to sleep, sit or lie down, not have pressures around me. <br/>
Nausea takes a lot of energy and ability to think as well. <br/>
<br/>
Ds does play video games and watch movies, but he usually wants me to <br/>
participate -- I&#39;m either playing the game with him or answering <br/>
questions/responding during movies. He hardly ever watches TV <br/>
anymore, because all of the kid&#39;s shows are in French, German or <br/>
Italian. <br/>
<br/>
Weekends go really well for me, because my husband is usually home <br/>
and taking over playing with ds -- I think I need to nurture myself <br/>
better and/or get a babysitter during the week. I like the babysitter <br/>
idea, because we can take time to get to know one person so that he <br/>
feels comfortable with her and she can give him all of her attention. <br/>
For so many reasons (that he communicates to me in many ways), I <br/>
don&#39;t think I&#39;ll find any sort of school or class that he will feel <br/>
comfortable with. <br/>
<br/>
So far, I know several other moms here, I guess I just need to ask if <br/>
they would be okay to take ds sometimes. That used to work out when <br/>
we lived in Seattle with a couple of my friends and their kids, <br/>
because we had already done several playdates at their homes and ds <br/>
knew them well enough.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for letting me get all these ideas on paper and for offering <br/>
suggestions.<br/>
