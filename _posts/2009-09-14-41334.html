<div id="ygrps-yiv-758688523">Thought I&#39;d take a moment to introduce myself. I&#39;m Dee & I have 5 out of 8<br/>
children at home right now. I took 3 out of 4 publicly schooled children out<br/>
of school back in December &#39;04 (the 4th wanted to stay & he was happy & well<br/>
adjusted, so I let him. He&#39;s just gone off to college this fall.) We are on<br/>
Cape Cod.<br/>
<br/>
We have done &quot;school at home&quot; with little success for most of this time.<br/>
However, I did notice that they seemed to learn more when they were <br/>
neglecting&quot; their assigned work. But I still hesitated on dropping it<br/>
because of fear of what &quot;others&quot; would say. You know, &quot;they don&#39;t DO<br/>
school??&quot; *gasp*. Anyway, after much research & prayer, I really feel led to<br/>
change our lives in many areas, including dropping all formal curricula. <br/>
<br/>
I have read articles from Christian perspectives (we have been since &#39;06),<br/>
both pro and con, and am even more sure that this is the right path for us. <br/>
<br/>
I subscribed to this list a few days ago and have already learned quite a<br/>
bit about general attitudes towards parenting (mostly positive!). I am<br/>
working diligently on my own temper. I am ashamed to say that I am a yeller.<br/>
I let the little things get under my skin. But I&#39;ve read so many helpful<br/>
articles (lots from Joyfully Rejoycing) that are helping me redefine my own<br/>
attitude about housework & parenting in general. I do believe we need to <br/>
train up our children&quot;, but more by modeling (aka discipleship) than by<br/>
force. If they see me working hard at cleaning things up, they MAY decide to<br/>
help (which they have been, realizing that the less I have to do, the more<br/>
free time we have together) more. Much less stress than the old scheduled<br/>
lists. But, I still get the occasional attack of &quot;OMG! Look at this mess!&quot;.<br/>
Guess I&#39;m still learning, too. Now I apologize for any outbursts. The kids<br/>
have been great.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I went off track a bit there....<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, at home I have Melissa (14), Sarah (13), Molly (almost 10 - Oct. 22)<br/>
 Michael (4) and Abigail (20 months). I also have a 21 year old (not at home<br/>
 no real contact - long story) son, 16 year old son (lives with Dad -<br/>
another long story) and my 18 year old son that just started college. :)<br/>
<br/>
Justin (the 16 y.o.), Melissa & Sarah were the original 3 I took out of<br/>
school. Justin (at his Dad&#39;s) is back in P.S. Melissa tried (her request)<br/>
going back last year for 7th grade. She lasted a month & wanted home again.<br/>
:) Molly is my first to never be in a public school and God-willing she or<br/>
the others never will be again.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for &quot;listening&quot; and I look forward to learning more from you all and<br/>
getting to know you better.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, when we strive to really live our own guiding principles, whether those be respect, kindness, generosity, grace, joyfullness... our kids get to see and hear and feel those things - they become real and tangible to our kids, not just ideas. Those values start to feel good, so good that they want to share the same kindness and generosity and joy with others (even their parents, hooray!). <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I am<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I used to be a yeller. I&#39;ve gotten much much better! Taking deep breaths helped, but for awhile I&#39;d have to take a deep breath somewhere about ten seconds into yelling - you know, that first time I&#39;d run out of air, I&#39;d take a deep breath and think &quot;this isn&#39;t what I want to be doing&quot; and then stop. And appologise and start over. <br/>
<br/>
A little further along my process I would start by yelling an &quot;I&quot; statement. Like &quot;I am sooooo frustrated right now!&quot; That helped shift the dynamic from me yelling At someone to me just yelling. That was better. <br/>
<br/>
Now I (mostly) manage to take a deep breath and think before I ever start yelling - this stuff gets easier with practice, I promise! <br/>
<br/>
Oh! Something that helps is being sensitive to my own needs and moods. Knowing when I&#39;m grouchy bc I need to eat, or rest, or am PMSy, for instance, helps me slow down a little and have less strenuous expectations for myself. Plus, I can let the family know &quot;Oh, sure I&#39;ll do that with you as soon as I eat, I&#39;m getting hungry and grouchy, so I&#39;d better eat something...&quot; <br/>
<br/>
and just as a side note, since food is the big issue of the day, this gets to be one of the times I talk about what&#39;s In food and how it affects moods etc, as it: &quot;so I&#39;d better eat something with protein and some vitamins in it before I bite anyone&#39;s head off.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-264206142">Another way to force yourself to not yell is to tuck your chin in toward<br/>
your neck - it&#39;s just not possible to yell in that position.<br/>
<br/>
We actually have at times encouraged DS to yell - not AT anyone, just<br/>
basic loud venting sound blast, not even any words though sometimes<br/>
&quot;Frustrated&quot; or &quot;Angry&quot; comes out as well. What I&#39;ve observed (totally<br/>
unscientific) is that a big sound blast yell (a) requires lots of muscle<br/>
involvement (b) requires a large intake of fresh oxygen all the way to<br/>
the bottom of the lungs (c) expels lots of CO2 - all of which contribute<br/>
to a decrease in stress feelings and help clear the brain.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also learned that the airplane guidelines regarding cabin pressure<br/>
apply to everyday &quot;pressures&quot; as well - make sure you put your own<br/>
&quot;oxygen mask&quot; on first and then deal with the kids. For instance, I used<br/>
to get really frustrated trying to get DS out the door for a morning<br/>
event (stuff where we had little control over the timing). It kept<br/>
happening over and over. So, I talked with DH about it first (to get<br/>
some feedback on what it &#39;looked like&#39;) and realized that I was trying<br/>
to get DS moving before I had breakfast. Bad move. I backed things up a<br/>
little, so that I had time to shower, dress, eat breakfast, and gather<br/>
whatever &#39;gear&#39; we needed before I even went to see if DS was awake.<br/>
Then  I could calmly and completely focus on him and his needs instead<br/>
of trying to get his clothing on him AND gathering stuff AND getting<br/>
myself dressed. It was the idea of a &#39;bottleneck&#39; that I gleaned from<br/>
Raising Your Spirited Child. Good book for folks looking for new tools<br/>
regardless of whether you actually are dealing with a spirited<br/>
personality or not.<br/>
<br/>
Read a brief bit in Pop Sci the other day that swearing actually<br/>
increases pain tolerance (guess that&#39;s why even the most gentle mannered<br/>
folks let out a bit of blue verbiage when they step on lego pieces at 2<br/>
in the morning!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1911256421">This gave me a chuckle because our 14-year-old son informed me of this with glee in the car just the other day. I hadn&#39;t heard it and I don&#39;t know where he got it -- online or cable, I suppose.  He said it was something about how long you can tolerate ice water on your skin and related it to pitchers icing their arms after a game (we&#39;re big Red Sox fans.)<br/>

I&#39;ve got a bad right knee from tennis and getting old &lt;grin&gt; and lately it flares up especially when my leg is bent and working, on the accelerator and brakes.
