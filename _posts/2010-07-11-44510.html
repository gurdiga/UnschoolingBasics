<div id="ygrps-yiv-905922615">This month&#39;s topic is: Picking up the pieces<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s easy unschooling when everything&#39;s going well, but what about when it&#39;s not? How do you maintain a sense of support and partnership when it seems like things are falling down around your ears? Share tales of unschooling through the rough stuff. <br/>
 <br/>
Some possible directions:<br/>
	How do you pick up the pieces when you&#39;ve fallen down or fallen apart? How do you rebuild trust and security between family members (kids and/or spouses). <br/>
 <br/>
	How do you maintain a sense of abundance during &quot;lean&quot; times?<br/>
 <br/>
	How has unschooling sustained you and your family during a crisis?<br/>
 <br/>
	How do you get from feeling that your life is a shambles to confidence and contentment - on an emotional level, or when housework gets That bad. <br/>
 <br/>
	What kind of support have you found helpful during harder times? Family? Friends? Strangers?<br/>
 <br/>
	When have you been able to help someone else who is having a hard time? How has that informed your unschooling life?<br/>
<br/>
The deadline for submissions is July 28  please send links to your submissions to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:EnjoyLifeUnschooling@...">EnjoyLifeUnschooling@...</a> <br/>
Look forward to reading your stories!<br/>
