The  kids <br/>
LOVE LOVE LOVE getting dressed up. They love going door to door. The  love <br/>
getting together with friends. All agree that the candy is not the  part of <br/>
trick <br/>
or treating that is great. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Another non-poster here, but in light of above, I would like to offer an  <br/>
alternative--this year we had the experience of trick-or-treating with friends  <br/>
whose daughter had a food allergy.  She trick-or-treated with a &#39;food  allergy <br/>
fund raising&#39; box.  Is that a viable alternative, with say, Unicef  or <br/>
another, maybe St. Jude&#39;s (children&#39;s cancer hospital) that would allow them  to <br/>
dress up, do the door to door, be with friends, count money, see how much  they <br/>
raised, and helped those less fortunate?  Could be a  win-win-win!<br/>
