<div id="ygrps-yiv-1516161870">Lately my mind has been spinning, I have found myself obsessively thinking <br/>
about college. My oldest daughter is starting college in the fall. I have so <br/>
much trepidation about it!<br/>
<br/>
I know that her desire to go to college is based on curiosity. She said she <br/>
is willing to play the game to get in in order to go. It is really bothering <br/>
me, I don&#39;t want her to go and I want her to try some online classes first. <br/>
She wants to go for a social aspect and has politely shrugged off online <br/>
classes.<br/>
<br/>
I would really like to hear what other have done in the situation, either <br/>
for your self or your child.<br/>
<br/>
I know my run away thoughts are getting too much of my time, but they are <br/>
just stuck there!<br/>
<br/>
Much Love,<br/>
Wildflower<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-366750466">I can relate.  My daughter (16) just started her first college class at the community college.<br/>
  At first I was concerned of the age and maturity, of whom she would be meeting.  Then I realized that my first born child has grown up and is a mature young lady who has been making mature decisions for awhile.  She is ready for this step.  <br/>
   <br/>
  It&#39;s hard to let them go and grow up, but try and trust her as she has trusted you all these years. My daughter thinks about moving to Berlin.  Oh, how I will miss her when she goes.<br/>
  I have tried to focus my energy in learning more about Berlin and helping her prepare instead of just hugging her tight and telling her I&#39;m keeping her with me forever.<br/>
   <br/>
  I don&#39;t know if this helps you at all, just thought I&#39;d let you know you&#39;re not alone.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1062554332">I don&#39;t know the age of your daughter so I am assuming she is a normal<br/>
college age. If so, I don&#39;t see anything wrong with going to college.<br/>
You have unschooled her so she can become the person she wants to be.<br/>
If the person she wants to be is someone with a college degree, then<br/>
more power to her. She may also go for a year or two and decide it&#39;s<br/>
not going to get her where she wants to go. But it&#39;s her path to<br/>
explore and the fact she wants to do it even though you are not<br/>
encouraging it says a lot about her and the great job you did raising<br/>
her. She clearly has her own mind.</div>
