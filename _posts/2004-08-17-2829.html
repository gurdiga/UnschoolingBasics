<div id="ygrps-yiv-1174424072">From a local list. I just thought I&#39;d share it here as well:<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;One thing that I hear again and again from parents on parenting sites,  <br/>
neighbours etc. that really frustrates me is how children need consistency. I  <br/>
think many parents really confuse, children needing consistency of a life  <br/>
structured by parents, teachers, etc., with what I see their true need  being...... <br/>
to feel secure. To me there is a  very big difference in  growing up feeling <br/>
secure in your life, (family, home, love) and growing up  under the authority <br/>
of someone else&#39;s consistency/structure. &quot;<br/>
