<div id="ygrps-yiv-2067580709">Let&#39;s  say Annie demands the ketchup at the table (a recent example), really <br/>
demands  it with an I WANT THE KETCHUP (no way to indicate the tone, but think <br/>
of  grumpy face, mean sounding voice)...this moment is wrought with questions <br/>
for  me right now (forget world peace, I&#39;m worried about ketchup!): do I just <br/>
 kindly hand her the ketchup and say nothing or do I kindly hand her the  <br/>
ketchup and say, &quot;I prefer to be spoken to kindly, is there something  bothering <br/>
you?&quot; I get that what I&#39;m NOT doing is saying &quot;if you&#39;ll ask nicely  I&#39;ll give <br/>
you the ketchup&quot; or &quot;get it yourself&quot; or throwing up my hands and  saying <br/>
this unschooling thing ain&#39;t working, look...she&#39;s rude.  Eeek!<br/>
 <br/>
**********<br/>
 <br/>
If the timing is good for it, I say in the same tone of voice &quot;well, I want  <br/>
some purple underwear&quot; or something equally as silly and with a silly look on <br/>
my  face so my kids know I&#39;m joking (and not making fun)!  This gets a laugh  <br/>
and then the game continues with more and more demanding of ridiculous  <br/>
things.  The next thing you know, a potentially parent vs. child moment has  become <br/>
a bonding time.  And they get the point.  Humor is almost  always great and in <br/>
our house, the sillier the better!<br/>
 <br/>
Or I&#39;ll ignore it.  Or I might ask in a bit if something is  wrong.  Or <br/>
sometimes I&#39;ll say what you say.  Or I&#39;ll rephrase in a  more pleasant tone.<br/>
 <br/>
I think for the most part, telling a child to not be rude (no matter how  <br/>
nicely phrased) won&#39;t teach a child to not be rude.  It might help a child  <br/>
recognize that she is using a rude tone, even grown-ups don&#39;t always realize  that, <br/>
but no one wants to hear it every single time!  You can let some pass  you <br/>
by!  And you are showing your children that they don&#39;t have to be  reactive <br/>
every time someone is rude to them.  How many times have you seen  people that <br/>
just don&#39;t let things go?  You can choose to not react without  being a door mat!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
My oldest with learning and language difficulties just didn&#39;t  understand me <br/>
when I was trying to teach him things like manners.  I  decided to really just <br/>
live by example, and mostly NOT react at all when he was  rude.  I really <br/>
didn&#39;t have much of a choice.  He is now nine, and  although not always the <br/>
nicest at home, other people are always commenting to me  how polite he is and that <br/>
I&#39;m so lucky!  LOL!<br/>
 <br/>
Have fun!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When my son was wee and he would talk this way, I would either:<br/>
<br/>
A)  Just hand it to him, realizing he may have been having a grumpy <br/>
day and the last thing he needs at that moment is to hear some crap <br/>
from me about politeness.  I would not take it personally, or<br/>
<br/>
B)  Hand it to him but tell him my honest feelings about being spoken <br/>
to like that.  I would not tell him he was being rude; I would tell <br/>
him I didn&#39;t like being spoken to as though I was a servant and that <br/>
it didn&#39;t make me feel like helping him.<br/>
<br/>
C)  In addition, I try to speak to him (as much as I possibly can - <br/>
I&#39;m not perfect, ya know) the way I like to be spoken to, not to <br/>
&quot;teach&quot; him how to speak to other folks, but because I figure that I <br/>
cannot expect him to do something I&#39;m not willing to do.  And, <br/>
because that&#39;s just the way I am.<br/>
<br/>
Now, at 11, the by-product of that is that he&#39;s very mindful of how <br/>
he speaks to other folks, and he notices when folks aren&#39;t so <br/>
nice.  When I&#39;m having a grumpy day and I don&#39;t speak so nicely to <br/>
him, I apologize to him for it (as soon as it&#39;s leaked out) and let <br/>
him know that it&#39;s not him; it&#39;s me.  He does the same for me.  I&#39;m <br/>
grateful that we give each other that kind of space.  One thing we&#39;re <br/>
both mindful of is that we don&#39;t want to waste the precious time that <br/>
we have together being mean to each other.  It&#39;s the easiest thing to <br/>
do, but we (dad, included) are each other&#39;s favorite folks, and it <br/>
doesn&#39;t make sense to be nasty to each other.  So, we&#39;re not.<br/>
<br/>
It turns out that he&#39;s good citizen (polite and all that) when he&#39;s <br/>
out there in the world (I&#39;m told), and I&#39;m delighted to hear that!  I <br/>
have never drilled him with that &quot;What do you say...?&quot; crap that I <br/>
had to endure; it always irked me to hear it.<br/>

definitely got it after only a couple of rare occasions of having to <br/>
say it.  I guess if I had had to say it more than once or twice, <br/>
there would definitely have been something else going on, and anyway, <br/>
saying something like that more than once or twice can only bring <br/>
diminishing returns, no?<br/>
