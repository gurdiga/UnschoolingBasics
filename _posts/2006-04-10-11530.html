 </span></blockquote>My advice is to take a deeeep breath.  Hyperventilating really <br/>
messes up the ability to think clearly!  Then -- take them home.  I <br/>
don&#39;t know what ages you have or anything, but if you have started <br/>
to consider it, consider this: I really wish I had started <br/>
homeschooling sooner.  We have been at it nearly 4 years.  My son <br/>
learned all sorts of things at school.  He learned to memorize and <br/>
spit back info, rather than to think about it, analyze it, <br/>
extrapolate from it.  (He could extrapolate beyond the facts before, <br/>
and when I realized that he shut down when asked non-factual <br/>
questions, I panicked that he was ruined for life.  The <br/>
extrapolative ability came back within a year -- from a rather <br/>
quirky direction, but I didn&#39;t care where, just that he had it <br/>
again!)  He learned to take frequent mental breaks, to dawdle, to <br/>
not focus on his tasks, and to stretch them out.  Not beneficial to <br/>
him, imo!  (Nothing wrong with mental breaks, but when a 10 minute <br/>
task takes hours, there is something wrong!)  This is NOT an ADD <br/>
kid, mind you -- and we are JUST getting that focus back.  He had to <br/>
find the right motivation and instigate it.  <br/>
<br/>
He lost a love of reading, due to reading requirements and rewards. <br/>
(Ever read Punished by Rewards by Alfie Kohn?)  <br/>
<br/>
He learned how to manipulate a teacher (he never did anything bad, <br/>
but got away with a lot of silliness, and really got away with <br/>
things I wish he hadn&#39;t.)  (The teacher was very sweet, but my son&#39;s <br/>
sense of humor and out-of-the-box thinking tended to be a half-step <br/>
or so ahead of her...)<br/>
<br/>
When you have your kids home, hug them.  Tell them how happy you are <br/>
to have them with you at home.  Connect with others, find out what <br/>
they want to do, build a fort, go for a walk, go to the library (my <br/>
home away from home), connect with your kids.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what prompted you to consider taking your kids out, but <br/>
whatever the reason is, I suspect that after you have been doing it <br/>
a while, you will find lots of other reasons to keep them home.  My <br/>
son has NO desire to go back to school (though he says he wants to <br/>
go to college at some point), and I know I love having him at home, <br/>
love the freedom, the conversations we have, seeing his perspective <br/>
on things, having his help on occasion.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll be amazed at what it can be like.<br/>

Thank you, a lot of things have brought me here, but basically there  is just <br/>
an unhappiness with the public school system and the fact that they want  to <br/>
put all of my children in the same mold, and make some of them feel &quot;stupid&quot;  <br/>
because they don&#39;t fit that mold.  But they are intelligent, they just  don&#39;t <br/>
follow the &quot;norm&quot;.  I am unhappy with an attendance policy that  states that I <br/>
need to take my children to the doctor because they have a stomach  bug.  I <br/>
refuse to put my children on medication because a teacher  classifies them as <br/>
ADHD when they just need to be engaged in an activity.   Shown a more <br/>
interesting way to see it<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks, I&#39;m just scared I don&#39;t have the ability to show them what they  need <br/>
to see!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-678399270">Hi Mandy...welcome!<br/>
It wasn&#39;t that long ago that I was thinking of taking my kids out of <br/>
school. I did a lot of reading, online and in books and I also <br/>
sought out other homeschoolers (offline) and talked to them abput <br/>
their experiences. <br/>
Can you tell us a little more about your kids? :-) What&#39;s making you <br/>
want to take them out of school and do they want to leave school? <br/>
And yes, I was scared also. LOL In the end though, you&#39;ll be <br/>
fine...just fine. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1613063717">OK, Hi all!  I am a SAHM of 4 wonderful boys.  They are 9, 7, 3,  and 2.  I <br/>
want to take them out of school because I don&#39;t think they are  living up to <br/>
their potential and I don&#39;t think they are learning as easily as  they could be. <br/>
 Learning has become a chore for them and I don&#39;t like  that.  I have one son <br/>
(my 7 year old) that has ADD.  But it is  extremely manageable if you can <br/>
take the time.  I do not believe he needs  meds for this.  I just think he needs <br/>
a different approach to learning and  life.  He is a bright and intelligent <br/>
boy, but that is not being  appreciated by his current school.  All they want is <br/>
more meds.  I  tried meds and did not like who he became on them, so I <br/>
quickly removed him as  soon as I could possibly do so.  MY 9 yr old is a bright and <br/>
very  inquisitive boy.  Extremely intelligent, I worry if I can keep up with  <br/>
him.  My 3 year old is a normal healthy happy young child.  My 2 year  old <br/>
has colaboma and was diagnosed with something called CHARGE syndrome, which  <br/>
seems like a crock to me (don&#39;t get offended if your child has this!), but to me  <br/>
it seems like a syndrome for parents to put a &quot;label&quot; on their child.  My  <br/>
child has a slight abnormality, but nothing that should put him in the learning  <br/>
disabled category.  He may not speak on schedule, but he has been able to  <br/>
put puzzles together since he was 6 mos. old.  All children will learn on  their <br/>
own schedule has been my opinion for many years,  but until someone  told me <br/>
of this group, it never occurred to me that there was a way to continue  <br/>
teaching my child in this way!<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks, and I hope I have provided enough information.<br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi Mandy. Welcome to the group.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s normal to be a little scared when thinking about venturing off into something so new. After all, most of us went to school. Some of us went for 16+ years! It&#39;s what we know. It&#39;s what society tells us is important over and over again. But if you&#39;re considering something different for your family you must have a reason. There must be something about this system of schooling that&#39;s not working for you.<br/>
<br/>
So try to relax and focus on why you&#39;re asking the kinds of questions you are regarding schooling. Read all you can about unschooling here and at other sites. www.sandradodd.com/unschooling is a really complete site with tons of info. Think about what you hope to give your family by releasing them from school. Think about the joy of having them home.<br/>
<br/>
I was once in your situation. My son went to school through 4th grade.  I was scared too, but bringing my son home and giving him the freedom to learn has been the best decision I&#39;ve made for him. He&#39;s 16 now and every bit as intelligent, self-assured, caring and interesting as I knew he was way back when school told me I needed to &quot;fix&quot; him.<br/>

nurture their spirits or leaving them in school where they will continue<br/>
with the same that they currently are getting?<br/>
<br/>
I just don&#39;t believe if you are an attentive parent that you can screw your<br/>
kids up by bringing them home.  What is it exactly that frightens you so?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do remember, gifted kids often exhibit ADD-like symptoms w/out <br/>
actually being ADD.  I truly think that if my son had been in ps all <br/>
along, they would have tried to slap that label on him.  That <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean that your son isn&#39;t ADD -- and if he is, I have heard <br/>
there are lots of ways in dealing with it.  <br/>
<br/>
BTW, I also think that my son would have gotten phenomenally <br/>
mediocre grades if he were in school.  It is hard to pay attention <br/>
when you already know the material....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All they want is <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; more meds.  I  tried meds and did not like who he became on them, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>so I <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; quickly removed him as  soon as I could possibly do so.  MY 9 yr <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; very  inquisitive boy.  Extremely intelligent, I worry if I can <br/>
 </span></blockquote>keep up with  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; him. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Check out homeschoolingmensans.  A lot of folk there worry about <br/>
those issues, too.  My son is 14, and although I know I can&#39;t <br/>
understand/teach everything he wants to learn, he is capable of <br/>
reading and understanding a LOT.  You can also find others in the <br/>
area who might serve as mentors if your son has a particular <br/>
interest in depth.  <br/>
<br/>
One of the great things about homeschooling is that they CAN follow <br/>
their passions, even if it isn&#39;t something that schools teach.  My <br/>
son could tell you a fair bit about codes and the enigma machine -- <br/>
more than I know about!  If he were in school, he probably wouldn&#39;t <br/>
have had the time to learn about this, because he would have had 6 <br/>
hours there, plus a good 2 hours or more homework.  (Do you read the <br/>
comics?  Zits?  There was a series of strips about how Jeremy was so <br/>
tired, and his mother asked how did they expect kids to learn if <br/>
they are so tired from doing so much homework.  Jeremy said that <br/>
they don&#39;t go to school to learn, they go to get their homework <br/>
assignments!)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  All children will learn on  their <br/>
&gt; own schedule has been my opinion for many years,  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree!  Asking them to learn lockstep is kind of like asking them <br/>
to grow and develop lockstep.  My son is 14, but looks 12.  He <br/>
hasn&#39;t hit puberty yet, but the majority of 14 yr olds have.  So, <br/>
does he need remedial growth classes?  (I say no -- I know he will <br/>
be taller than me within a year without hitting that classic growth <br/>
spurt, and I don&#39;t want to be shorter than him any sooner than I <br/>
need to!)<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like you have lots of really good reasons to want to <br/>
homeschool.  I would say, go ahead and do it.  They are unhappy in <br/>
school -- and so often that causes spill-over behavior at home.  You <br/>
are unhappy with their school experiences.  The worries about <br/>
handling things down the road when they are older -- I know I had <br/>
them, but somehow,it seems to work out okay!  At least, it has so <br/>
far for us.<br/>

quickly.........the school system just wants everyone that doesn&#39;t fit their  mold <br/>
on meds....I just can&#39;t agree with that<br/>

That I can&#39;t keep up with them.......i&#39;m very ADD and have a hard  time<br/>
paying attention to details.........LOL<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is one of my favorite subjects - ADD/ADHD.  I have a theory that I have<br/>
put together after years of looking at ADD/ADHD.  I believe that the<br/>
majority of people, especially adults, who have been labelled ADD/ADHD<br/>
actually are BORED.  They are working in professions that bring them little<br/>
or no joy.  They think they are ADD because they can&#39;t pay attention.  Yet<br/>
they go home and spend all weekend tying flies, gardening, reading, building<br/>
model railroads, dinking with their computers, etc etc etc and have no<br/>
problem paying attention.  We also are a society that is conditioned to<br/>
think of life in 30 minute intervals.  We are a &quot;sitcom society.&quot;  And to<br/>
make it worse we need at least one &quot;commercial break&quot; for every 30 minutes<br/>
of our life!  We&#39;ve made ourselves distractable.  And then there is the<br/>
whole food influence.  Look at all the additives, preservatives, colorings,<br/>
flavorings, and fillers we have added to our food to make them fit into that<br/>
30 minute sitcom life.  We can make dinner in 20 minutes because we just<br/>
have to &quot;fix it and forget it.&quot;  Fast food makes up a good portion of the US<br/>
diet.  Who can think when they have been saturated with fat, cholesterol,<br/>
empty complex carbohydrates, and lacking in fresh vegetables, fruits and<br/>
*real* foods?<br/>
<br/>
The beautiful part of bringing your children home is that you get to be on<br/>
vacation for the rest of your life.  Think of it like that.  You are free to<br/>
do whatever you want.  You can play, sing, laugh, dance, and get totally<br/>
engrossed in the things that you and your children want to do.  Don&#39;t<br/>
categorize things into &quot;adult things&quot; and &quot;kid things.&quot;  Enjoy getting down<br/>
on the floor and playing with building blocks.  Relive the joy of digging in<br/>
the dirt.  Go ride your bike and get into a &quot;children&#39;s book&quot;  And on the<br/>
reverse, invite your children to get into your world.  Let them meet the<br/>
characters of West Wing, read to them from a book that you have enjoyed (The<br/>
DaVinci code is a current favorite in our house), invite them into the<br/>
kitchen to help prepare meals, and if they would like let them stay for an<br/>
&quot;adult&quot; service at church.  The church we used to attend did not require<br/>
children leave for the children&#39;s building during church and our oldest<br/>
enjoyed many services.<br/>
<br/>
I realize that there are people who truly do have ADD.  I think right now it<br/>
is a handy phrase to make &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot; sound better.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There are definitely jobs that lend themselves to the personality traits currently labelled ADD. My husband and I once saw a TV commercial about adult ADD. It said something like &quot;What if you were at a meeting and had 20 thoughts racing through your head at the same time?&quot; Jon just laughed and said &quot;Run a restaurant! You need to be able to think and juggle 20 things at the same time.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s just what he did. He quit the corporate grind and we bought a coffeeshop that he expanded into a full-fledged restaurant. He probably works harder now than ever before, but it&#39;s different. He loves it.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oooh, the ugly S word!  :-0  We worried about that initially, too.  <br/>
But if you look at what outcome you want, is it for your  children <br/>
to learn behaviors from kids exactly their age?  Would you want a <br/>
bunch of 7 yr olds setting the standards?  Because that, really, is <br/>
what is happening.  As for learning to get along with others of <br/>
different ilk -- that, too happens in the homeschool world.  In <br/>
fact, it happens better.  Homeschoolers are a very diverse bunch, <br/>
and the ages mingle more than in public school.  <br/>
<br/>
You need to get the right books in front of him, with pages <br/>
bookmarked that will speak to his particular concerns.  It seems a <br/>
lot more fathers are hard sells to homeschooling than moms.  And <br/>
some don&#39;t come around until their children are so totally miserable <br/>
that they realize something HAS to be done.  Far better to pre-<br/>
emptively deal with things, than let them come to such a head, imo.<br/>
<br/>
My dh is fully behind our homeschooling at this point.  My folks <br/>
were worried about social issues, too -- and they don&#39;t seem to have <br/>
those concerns anymore.<br/>
<br/>
If you can pin down his exact concerns (there might be more than <br/>
just that issue), you can calmly deal with them -- when he is in a <br/>
receptive mood.  At least, that is what I would recommend.<br/>

I agree with you sooooo much on your take concerning add, adhd Michelle! I <br/>
have a friend who&#39;s son is adhd & adehd. They have him taking antidepressants, <br/>
and what ever the latest drugs are for his &quot;disorders.&quot; They &quot;up&quot; his dosage <br/>
constantly and the poor kid has been on them since he was THREE! He&#39;s now 12. I <br/>
feel so sorry for him! His diet consists completely of prepackaged, over <br/>
processed, quick foods, he was thrown into tons of different child care places just <br/>
about since birth. Although he is capable of getting great grades, he has <br/>
lots of trouble in school. It&#39;s really sad.<br/>

It&#39;s amazing what parents will do these days to actually get away  w/out <br/>
having to parent in my opinion.  The label ADD doesn&#39;t bother  me.  But the idea <br/>
that my child needs to be put on meds for it does.   He just needs to go about <br/>
getting his education in a different way.  I dont  think we all learn the same <br/>
way, which makes no sense as to why they try to  teach everyone the same way.<br/>
