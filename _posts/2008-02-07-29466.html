<div id="ygrps-yiv-1204885171">&quot;My dad&#39;s got 4 sisters, yentas all (check Fiddler on the Roof, the <br/>
matchmaker character, for a sample) and us kids joked (to ourselves) <br/>
that if you put all 4 of them in a room, they could have at least 20 <br/>
conversations all at the same time. As kids, we got really good at <br/>
being able to tune in and out of conversations so we could follow <br/>
the interesting ones (like Who wants to take the kids for ice <br/>
cream?) and ignore the boring ones (like Uncle Harry&#39;s sciatica is <br/>
flaring up again).&quot;<br/>

  Haha! <br/>
