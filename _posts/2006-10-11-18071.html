<div id="ygrps-yiv-1495918518">Dear List,<br/>
<br/>
today I have a new question for you. The other day I posted about I  <br/>
don&#39;t know what anymore, and got the answer, that not all unschooling  <br/>
families would live consensual, that is, not all decide by trying to  <br/>
meet all of the family members needs.<br/>
<br/>
How do you decide things which concern more than one party in your  <br/>
family? Do you find compromises, do you alternate (one day you get  <br/>
your way, one day another one), do you democratically vote, do you  <br/>
sometimes just decided what&#39;s best, or do you do somethign completely  <br/>
different?<br/>
<br/>
Joyce, I guess because of your website I thought that unschooling was  <br/>
about meeting everyones needs, which to me implied that we always try  <br/>
to find a way which pleases everyone. Now I was told that this is  <br/>
only &quot;radical unschooling&quot; and that the rest of unschoolers don&#39;t  <br/>
necessarily do this.<br/>
<br/>
What do they do then?<br/>
<br/>
Greetings<br/>
Johanna</div>

 </span></blockquote>I know I am not Joyce.  For me and our family we do live consensually, <br/>
which involves working together to find mutual solutions that meet the <br/>
needs of everyone.  Some unschoolers and some radical unschoolers do <br/>
not do this.  I have seen some describe what they do in their homes as <br/>
gentle parenting.  The child&#39;s wants and needs are considered, but not <br/>
everyone&#39;s wants and needs are met.  Sometimes it comes down to meeting <br/>
the wants and needs of the majority.  Or sometimes the parent will <br/>
sacrifice what they want or need for the child.  I have heard some say <br/>
they would use coercion if needed but in a gentle respectful way.  I do <br/>
say that some Radical Unschoolers do live consensually.<br/>
<br/>
Quite similar but not the same.  If you want to learn more about <br/>
Consensual Living I would invite you to join our CL list <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/consensual-living">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/consensual-living</a><br/>
<br/>
I hope that helps.  I don&#39;t want to take up much list time talking <br/>
about CL when we could be talking about the ins and outs of beginning <br/>
unschooling.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1327156508">We change according to the need, everyone&#39;s interest and ability.  <br/>
Usually it&#39;s something we can all compromise on, but since there are  <br/>
so many of us, including one severely disabled child, sometimes we  <br/>
have to just say, THIS is what we can handle, or it is not possible  <br/>
to do THAT. What can we do to make it up to you? I&#39;m lucky in that  <br/>
mostly the kids like to be together, and they are usually happy to go  <br/>
along with what someone else wants.<br/>
<br/>
For example, going to the amusement park last weekend, it&#39;s very hard  <br/>
for Bre to deal with crowds and noise. It was a big stretch for her,  <br/>
we made it as pleasant as possible with shooter&#39;s muffs to block  <br/>
sound, lots of soda and etc. On rides we had to work to alternate big  <br/>
kids rides with the little kids stuff, and on top of all making sure  <br/>
i get a break so that I&#39;m not completely disabled the next day. It&#39;s  <br/>
a lot of work, and very intense, but worth it in the end. At the very  <br/>
end, when Emily wanted &#39;just one more ride&#39;, it meant that I had to  <br/>
bust double time to make Breanna happy to wait (lots of massage,  <br/>
hugs, reminders of chicken nuggets), but it was worth the investment  <br/>
to me to make Emily and Josh happy.<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re reading too much into it all.<br/>
<br/>
SOME unschooling families work consensually.<br/>
<br/>
SOME unschooling families work democratically.<br/>
<br/>
SOME unschooling families work compromisingly.<br/>
<br/>
SOME (not many!&lt;g&gt;) unschooling families still live within a <br/>
dictatorship.<br/>
<br/>
Some unschooling families live somewhere between these lines---most are <br/>
trying to be better and better.<br/>
<br/>
I think we can all agree that consensus would be best. We&#39;d ALL like to <br/>
get what we want.<br/>
<br/>
And like unschooling, the more you WORK at a consensual relationship, <br/>
the better you get at it.<br/>
<br/>
And since in unchooling children&#39;s needs/wants are seen as just as <br/>
important as adults&#39;, it would make sense to work at both.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What I think is important is treating everyone&#39;s needs with respect.  <br/>
The needs of a child who is done shopping aren&#39;t less important than  <br/>
Mom&#39;s needs who isn&#39;t done. What Mom has though, is control over the  <br/>
situation when the child is powerless. We can choose to organize our  <br/>
days differently, make smaller shopping trips, go without and make  <br/>
do, compensate them for their time and so on ...<br/>
<br/>
Which is why there&#39;s lots of writing about seeing things from a  <br/>
child&#39;s point of view. To see the emotional difference between  <br/>
choosing to do something you don&#39;t want to and being made to.<br/>
<br/>
I think for many people taking children&#39;s feelings seriously a tough  <br/>
mindset to grasp. We often shove aside our own feelings and wants to  <br/>
do the things we &quot;have to&quot; for the family so it&#39;s hard to even hear  <br/>
let alone take seriously a child who is trying to get us to  <br/>
understand that she&#39;s tired or hungry or bored. We&#39;re just so used to  <br/>
telling *ourselves* &quot;Tough about not wanting to. We have to get this  <br/>
done.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Which is why there&#39;s lots of writing about eliminating &quot;have to&quot; and  <br/>
seeing how the &quot;have to&quot;s in our lives are really choices.<br/>
<br/>
Whether than looks like consensual living, or democracy or some other  <br/>
form of treating people with respect, is up to each family. The  <br/>
important part is the respect.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We talk about it.  We weigh each person&#39;s opinion.  We make<br/>
compromises or find alternative solutions to try to make everyone the<br/>
most happy.  It&#39;s not always easy and sometimes there is one person<br/>
who feels like their needs were not met.  We&#39;ve had scheduling<br/>
conflicts.  Fortunately, I have a co-parent who has a fairly flexible<br/>
schedule and can work from home if need be.  There have been times<br/>
that he has opted to work at home and take an extended or early or<br/>
late lunch break so that different parties in the family can get to<br/>
the things that they need to do.<br/>
<br/>
We try our hardest to meet everyone&#39;s needs and busy schedules.  It<br/>
doesn&#39;t always happen, though.<br/>
