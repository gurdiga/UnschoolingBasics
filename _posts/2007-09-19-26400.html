<div id="ygrps-yiv-1841808186">Hello!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Christine, mom to Camryn (8), Addison (4), and William (2). My <br/>
husband&#39;s name is Chris. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been interested in homeschooling for several years and have <br/>
researched it pretty thoroughly. I felt certain that, when the time <br/>
came, I would choose that option for my kids&#39; education.<br/>
<br/>
In the end though, I chickened out and enrolled Camryn in public <br/>
schools, where she has become increasingly bored and understimulated <br/>
ever since. <br/>
<br/>
Academically, she&#39;s pretty far ahead of her second grade peers (she <br/>
tested at the fifth grade level in reading and writing and the <br/>
fourth grade level in math last year), but socially, she&#39;s right <br/>
where she should be. When I inquired about the gifted program, her <br/>
teacher told me it was essentially a bureaucratic nightmare to get <br/>
her involved before the third grade.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, she&#39;s fairly disillusioned by the school system at the point <br/>
(as am I), and so we will be beginning our homeschooling journey in <br/>
about three weeks (!).<br/>
<br/>
We are going to start out with a sabbatical in which Camryn <br/>
evaluates her interests, then we&#39;ll start unschooling from there. <br/>
I&#39;m here to learn all I can about unschooling. I&#39;m glad there&#39;s a <br/>
group like this for newbies. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-134534084">That &#39;sabbatical&#39; as you call it IS unschooling or rather that is<br/>
deschooling and once she&#39;s moved into exploring her own interests,<br/>
you&#39;re unschooling - there need not be a start/end type thing. Sort of<br/>
the way summer becomes autumn becomes winter becomes spring - it&#39;s a<br/>
process totally unlike the start/stop grade level thing of school (or<br/>
homeschooling).<br/>
