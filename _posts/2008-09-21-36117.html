<div id="ygrps-yiv-1530982212"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; The idea of &quot;inflicting an opinion&quot; is pretty deep.  Forcing someone  <br/>
&gt; to (live by?  think?) your thoughts- would that be an accurate  <br/>
&gt; representation of your intended meaning?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s a concept I hadn&#39;t thought of before.  My mom let us make a lot  <br/>
&gt; of stupid mistakes as we were growing up. I always resented that she  <br/>
&gt; never gave us advice or her opinions on any matter.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So, you would have preferred advice, warnings and opinions? Do you  <br/>
think you would have done things differently if she&#39;d only &quot;inflicted  <br/>
an opinion&quot; on you?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone here would say not to give your kids the benefit  <br/>
of your opinion or even advice. But, your kids will make their own  <br/>
decisions. And they might be different choices than the ones you&#39;ve  <br/>
made or would hope they&#39;d make. But, if they feel respected and  <br/>
trusted by you, they will take your opinions/advice into consideration.<br/>
<br/>
Spouses do, too :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It&#39;s been a challenge in my parenting, because I think it&#39;s good to  <br/>
&gt; share our opinions, I would have loved to have known that my mother  <br/>
&gt; even cared.  The way she said &quot;do what you want&quot; always made me feel  <br/>
&gt; abandoned, as if she didn&#39;t care.  With my girls, I try to engage in  <br/>
&gt; a conversation when they want advice.  I ask several questions until  <br/>
&gt; it looks like they&#39;ve expressed all their thoughts and feelings,  <br/>
&gt; then I ask more questions, to make sure I am undersanding their  <br/>
&gt; perspectives.  I ask them how THEY would like to handle it, and  <br/>
&gt; Instead of giving advice, I hope to be teaching them that I do care,  <br/>
&gt; and helping them make decisions based upon their own thoughts and  <br/>
&gt; opinions.  I wonder, how do other people handle such a thing.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that&#39;s not so different from what many parents would do here.  <br/>
It varies, though, because some kids don&#39;t want a lot of questions and  <br/>
discussion. My daughter, for instance, hates to talk for long about  <br/>
anything she&#39;s thinking about. She needs plenty of time on her own to  <br/>
mull things over. She will ask my opinion, though often she&#39;s already  <br/>
come to her own conclusion. When there are &quot;issues&quot; I might consider  <br/>
worthy of discussion, I don&#39;t approach her head-on. I come at things  <br/>
sideways. We&#39;ll sometimes discuss things in the car - she in the back  <br/>
while I&#39;m driving. But she&#39;ll tell me when she doesn&#39;t want to talk or  <br/>
when she&#39;s done.<br/>
<br/>
What has worked best for us lately is for me to write my thoughts down  <br/>
in a letter to her. She can read it at her leisure, think about it,  <br/>
then make her own decisions. Based on the relationship we have, the  <br/>
fact that she feels she can trust my opinions or advice (and that took  <br/>
some time for me to build, as I was not good at this when she was  <br/>
younger) she&#39;ll make decisions that usually make sense to both of us.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I do care, but I wouldn&#39;t dream of forcing them to make social  <br/>
&gt; decisions based upon my feelings on the matter.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Are there other kinds of decisions that you would force them to make,  <br/>
ones that are not social decisions?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So I listen and if they can&#39;t think of a solution, I try to offer up  <br/>
&gt; a few different ways they can handle it, based upon their stated  <br/>
&gt; perspectives and we also discuss possible outcomes and ways the  <br/>
&gt; other people might react, and we try to hash out how SHE would like  <br/>
&gt; to handle it.  I try to bring them back to their desired outcome.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Fair enough.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I get the feeling that some people here had parents who &quot;inflicted  <br/>
&gt; opinions&quot; and they&#39;re trying not to do that.  Does the same thing  <br/>
&gt; apply to teenage social and emotional issues?  What do you do to  <br/>
&gt; show kids that you care about their dilemma, and how do you help  <br/>
&gt; them try to find their own answers without &quot;abandoning&quot; them?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Listen. With focused attention. Without minimizing her worries. Many  <br/>
times without advice or opinions. For my daughter, those can get in  <br/>
the way of processing what&#39;s going on in her heart and mind.  <br/>
Sometimes, if I feel she&#39;s open to it, I will ask if she wants help.  <br/>
I&#39;ll accept &quot;yes,&quot; &quot;no,&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; and sometimes, &quot;leave me  <br/>
alone.&quot; I know, for sure, that listening is enough when she&#39;s gotten  <br/>
to that point!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Are the endless conversations we have in my house typical?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not in my house &lt;BWG&gt;. But, maybe in others.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My mother would have listened, and then not commented, not delved  <br/>
&gt; any deeper than our initial request, asked any questions or given  <br/>
&gt; any advice at all.  By the time I was 12, I had learned that I  <br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t expect any kind of validation, advice or opinions from her  <br/>
&gt; and I stopped talking to her about everything.  I would have LOVED  <br/>
&gt; if she had ever even offered up her advice, and I can definitely say  <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve never had it &quot;inflicted&quot; upon me.  She was horribly abused when  <br/>
&gt; she was a kid, and I think she always minimized our dilemmas because  <br/>
&gt; she really had it worse.  She also didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; trust her judgement, and I never knew that until I was an adult.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It seems to me there is a lot of baggage you are carrying with you in  <br/>
your parenting (and you&#39;ve identified your husband&#39;s baggage, too).   <br/>
Just as you suggested that people don&#39;t want to &quot;inflict opinions&quot; on  <br/>
their kids because their parents did, you also seem to be doing just  <br/>
the opposite of what your mother did.<br/>
<br/>
Looking at your children for who *they* are and what *they* need is  <br/>
more important in unschooling than trying to undo the damage from your  <br/>
own childhood by doing the opposite of what was done to you. By  <br/>
looking at what your kids want and need and doing that, you *do* re- <br/>
parent yourself.<br/>
