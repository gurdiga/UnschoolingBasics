<div id="ygrps-yiv-1484635189">unschoolingbasicsYesterday we went to the new cupcake shop in town. Almost all they sell are really beautiful and delicious cupcakes.<br/>
<br/>
DD&#39;s comment?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Wow, they were really having fun.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Me: &quot;Who?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The cupcakers. What a fun job!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now, DD&#39;s not the gamer in the family and DD&#39;s not learning to be a baker but what she was focusing on was the fun these two people were having running their little shop. Baking and chatting and making the previously dingy sub shop a pretty place, etc. We all know there&#39;s a lot of business knowledge behind all the pretty but there was also a lot of joy just bubbling out of these people.<br/>
<br/>
DD doesn&#39;t need to be forced to take a baking class or told not to join her brother for the gaming she does do to know that that&#39;s how she&#39;d like to be when she has a job some day.<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t control how the kids learn these things. We can&#39;t guide or drive them onto a career path we want -- we could try but they can skip off the path pretty darned easily. We can&#39;t control, in the end. That&#39;s important -- and freeing -- to remember. We can provide (time, lots of time, opportunities to explore), encourage, set examples, etc. But we can&#39;t control the outcome.<br/>
