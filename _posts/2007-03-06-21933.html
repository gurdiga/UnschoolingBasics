<div id="ygrps-yiv-2062593850">Hi I just joined the group. I&#39;m Tishia Bragg a sahm w/3 girls. Tresa <br/>
13yrs., Jessica 11yrs., Cara 7yrs.. My DH is in the Army. We are new to <br/>
home schooling, and unschooling. I have lots of questions, and have <br/>
been to to many sites to remember!!!! Here is just one of my many <br/>
questions. My oldest daughter is going into highschool next year. I can <br/>
only home school her if I go through a church school. So I am wondering <br/>
if I can still unschool if I do that? Thank you all for any help you <br/>
give! Sorry if this isn&#39;t a very good intro..<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Where do you live? There may be an unschooling yahoo group for that <br/>
area - you can look in the links section. Otherwise search <br/>
for &quot;eclectic&quot; homeschool groups in the area and talk to those <br/>
folks. Most states, as far as I know, also have a state site where <br/>
you can read the relevant laws yourself (if you want). I live in TN <br/>
where they have the &quot;church related school&quot; option. Some CRS&#39;s let <br/>
you have total control over your curriculum or lack thereof, but may <br/>
ask for a statement of faith or ethics. <br/>
<br/>
If you are in TN, you also have the option of &quot;The Farm School @ <br/>
Home&quot; as a CRS. You don&#39;t have to submit a statement of faith, or <br/>
use a set curriculum, although you do have to submit a &quot;learning <br/>
plan&quot;. Here&#39;s their website if you want more info:<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The laws are why I am asking all questions about crs, and <br/>
unschooling. I have been reading on the Tn law for a week. Yuck! Do <br/>
you know any crs that let you have total control over curriculum, <br/>
and do not ask for a statement of faith or ethics? <br/>
I have found a few on the Tn home ed site. I have found a problem <br/>
with them though. Once I follow the link to crs&#39;s site all the info  <br/>
is totlally different from Tn home ed.   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have been on the farm site too. I can&#39;t find any contact info for <br/>
them. I keep hoping I am over looking it. What is difference between <br/>
a set curriculum, and learning plan with them? Or have you ever <br/>
worked with them?<br/>
<br/>
Any way thank you for all your help! I am going to check out the <br/>
links and see what I find.<br/>

<br/>
The &quot;learning plan&quot; is divided up into subjects - you can download <br/>
and print the form from the site. If you are using a curriculm you <br/>
would list it there. If not, in the column entitled &quot;resources&quot; put <br/>
what you anticipate using as resources. Under &quot;math&quot;, for example I <br/>
have listed: kitchen, woodshop, garden, family finances, personal <br/>
finances. Next time I&#39;ll add &quot;games&quot; - he&#39;s learning about economics <br/>
on Runescape, so that would be &quot;math&quot;. Other &quot;subjects&quot; I&#39;ve listed <br/>
things we&#39;ve used already and am keeping track of what we&#39;re using <br/>
*now* for next time.<br/>
<br/>
I may see you on TNunschooling, or you can email me privately, it <br/>
you&#39;re lost.<br/>
