<div id="ygrps-yiv-219782314">Hi Folks,<br/>
I&#39;m trying to figure out if we can play World of Warcraft on a MacBook.  My son has been <br/>
playing lots of other games but is now interested in the WoW.  Anyone plays WoW on a <br/>
MacBook?<br/>
All markers seem pointing to us getting a new desktop in the near future.  But until that <br/>
happens I think he wants to see if he can play.<br/>
Thanks for any advice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1422575277">Yup, you can! I recently started playing with my daughter through the  <br/>
Recruit-a-Friend program. Dd plays on a PC and I play on a MacBook.  <br/>
You can either download the program through the Blizzard site, or buy  <br/>
the software for a Mac.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1334022062">Thanks for all the responses.  We finally got the WOW trial up and  <br/>
running on the MacBook and will probably buy the online download this  <br/>
evening so that my son can join the Unschoolers Area - he can&#39;t join  <br/>
in on the trial.   It worked out well that my parents just got high  <br/>
speed internet because we had to come over to Tobago for some  <br/>
business on my part and he was still able to play.  It&#39;s been great  <br/>
hooking up with Brenda&#39;s son who we just met on Skype through this  <br/>
list (I think).  Kwamena&#39;s been chatting to him several times a day  <br/>
and learning to play because of him.<br/>
Thanks again<br/>
Gillian<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I&#39;ll put some pictures of Tobago up on my blog later tonight.</div>
