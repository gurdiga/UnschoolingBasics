<div id="ygrps-yiv-1177882189">I have no idea how long it&#39;s been since I posted here, but I have been no-mail for a long time...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Dana, radical unschooling mama to Lauren, 16, Otto, 11, and Miranda, 9 months.  We live in beautiful Bellingham, WA.  I am a coffee roasting goddess and a barista extraordinaire, and as I sit on the internet between customers, I needed a little more reading material, so I signed up to get emails again....And I thought I&#39;d introduce myself incase I feel inclined to write ;)<br/>
<br/>
So....hi :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-55536246">Hey, Dana! Good to see you here again.<br/>
<br/>
Robin B.<br/>
<br/>
P.S. She is indeed the coffee roasting goddess. Her &quot;Day of the Dead&quot;  <br/>
roast is, uh, to die for &lt;g&gt;. Not only that, she&#39;s probably the first  <br/>
true radical unschooler I met in WA. I&#39;ve learned a lot from her, and  <br/>
her kids.<br/>
