<div id="ygrps-yiv-933913420">Hi, I am sending this out to all of my homeschooling yahoo groups. <br/>
Please do not consider this spam. <br/>
<br/>
Today, I learned of an awesome exhibit in Hartford, Connecticut at <br/>
the XL Center. I have no marketing materials to post, so please bear <br/>
with me. I do not know if this is a traveling exhibit that will come <br/>
to your state or not.<br/>
<br/>
From April 12- the end of July or August, the XL Center in Hartford <br/>
has the Titanic Exhibit.<br/>
<br/>
I guess this is not just a bunch of artifacts on shelves...but they <br/>
have the exhibit set up where your ticket is a boarding pass with the <br/>
name of an actual passenger on it. When you enter, you are walking <br/>
on boards like that from a ship in that time. There are passage ways <br/>
that make you feel like you are actually on the Titanic! <br/>
<br/>
The exhibit is interactive and I thought it would be an awesome <br/>
history lesson for home schoolers. <br/>
<br/>
I plan on traveling from Western New York State to Hartford next <br/>
month on business. I also plan on bringing my kids so we can check <br/>
it out in person.<br/>
<br/>
Have a great day!<br/>
<br/>
