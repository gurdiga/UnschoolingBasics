<div id="ygrps-yiv-1329855661">Why do all her dolls have light hair and skin? <br/>
<br/>
There are plenty of doll options that are brown skinned, and I made it a point of buying them for my girls even tho they are white. I wanted them to have the whole array of possibilites. I bought dark skinned baby dolls, black barbies, whatever. <br/>
At this point, you could ask her if she wants a doll who looks like her or not. Maybe that is not important to her. If she likes dolls, I would probably buy her some other dolls as well that are darker skinned. If you can&#39;t find them in Utah, you can probably get them online. Or ask this list. Where I live they are everywhere, as I  live in CA where there is a good level of diversity. <br/>

Why do all her dolls have light hair and skin? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
******************************************************<br/>
That&#39;s my point, she doesn&#39;t *want* dolls with skin like hers, and it just makes me wonder if her self-esteem is suffering in some way because all she wants are light-skinned dolls.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Try turning it around. If a European child were growing up among  <br/>
Africans, wouldn&#39;t it make sense that she&#39;d want a doll that looked  <br/>
like her friends and family?<br/>
<br/>
If an Earthing were growing up among aliens, wouldn&#39;t they want a  <br/>
doll to represent another playmate?<br/>
<br/>
As a child, I didn&#39;t want another me. I wanted my toys to be my  <br/>
friends! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I think it would actually be unusual -- though certainly nothing  <br/>
wrong -- if  a child (before a certain age) not only recognized they  <br/>
were profoundly different in appearance but that their surface made a  <br/>
difference and that they&#39;d want to be surrounded by others that had  <br/>
*their* same superficial difference. Why? Why would the *child&#39;s*  <br/>
superficial difference matter? (Noticing *other&#39;s* differences can  <br/>
come early. But, I mean, a child (before a certain age) looking at  <br/>
her self and saying &quot;I don&#39;t fit in with you.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking there&#39;s a stage kids go through when they need to  <br/>
embrace how everyone is the same. It&#39;s comforting being part of the  <br/>
big group where differences don&#39;t matter. But then they move onto  <br/>
more of a self awareness of how they&#39;re unique.<br/>
<br/>
The stages shouldn&#39;t be rushed or artificially extended. Let her be  <br/>
your guide for when she&#39;s ready to explore what&#39;s unique about her.  <br/>
But before that she needs the grounding that she&#39;s the same.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m picturing a well meaning alien mother thinking her Earthling  <br/>
child needs some Earth identity and *skewing* their stories and toys  <br/>
to Earth things so they would have something to identify with. It  <br/>
would be like saying &quot;No, see, you&#39;re different from us. You  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t be identifying with the ones you love. You should be  <br/>
identifying with these total strangers.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Give her an opportunity to experience lots of different cultures,  <br/>
just as you would your other children. Then when she starts asking  <br/>
questions and showing interest in people who look like her, you can  <br/>
take it from there, using her as your guide.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-824664568">Im not sure how to approach this here.  It can be a loaded issue.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
In general, African Americans have self esteem issues when it comes to skin<br/>
color, hair, etc, etc.  The standard of beauty in this country generally<br/>
doesnt represent us.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I do agree with Joyce that the reason your daughter likes the fairer skinned<br/>
dolls is because she is accustomed to seeing people who look like the dolls.<br/>
There is some rationale to that.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Adding to that:  African American girls who grow up in African American<br/>
families also gravitate towards blonde/brunette dolls with lighter eyes.<br/>
Far too many studies have been done to show that by age 6 African American<br/>
girls dont see themselves as pretty when compared to their Caucasian<br/>
counterparts.  So its not just your daughter, and its not just because<br/>
shes around Caucasians.  Its a deep societal problem, sadly.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I would encourage you to buy her dolls of all different hues.  Dark to<br/>
light, Asian, African, European, Hispanic.  Just introduce the world to her.<br/>
Make it less about color and more about human differences and commonalities.<br/>
There are some great multicultural/multiethnic websites to buy dolls from:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2116992172">I&#39;m new to unschooling and don&#39;t know if I have any advice to give. But <br/>
I am also raising African American children in a mostly European <br/>
descended context. Since I&#39;ve been involved in the family I have tried <br/>
to make a point to offer them dolls of all different colors/cultures <br/>
(Asian, etc.). They also had various baby dolls already when I joined <br/>
the family: both blue-eyed and various shades of brown skin.<br/>
<br/>
They go through phases, sometimes expressing great hostility to their <br/>
brown-skinned baby dolls and &quot;liking&quot; only their blond, blue-eyed ones. <br/>
Sometimes I try to talk to them about this, trying to keep my response <br/>
low-key, &quot;why do you like your white dolls and not your brown/black <br/>
ones?&quot; My aim was to give them the chance to pull some of their thoughts <br/>
from totally unconscious to conscious where they could examine them for <br/>
themselves. I don&#39;t know whether I was successful or not, but it was an <br/>
opening. I figured they were at least working out some of what being <br/>
&#39;different&#39; in a very external appearance oriented culture does to us.<br/>
<br/>
BTW when they had the opportunity later to choose American Girl dolls <br/>
(my mom bought them each one) the older girl chose Kaya (Native <br/>
American) and the younger chose Addy (cuz she &quot;looks like me&quot;) but she <br/>
goes through phases of rejection of the doll.<br/>
<br/>
Again, I don&#39;t have any idea if what I am doing is helping the girls or <br/>
not, but I thought my experience might be of interest.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1617436836">It is so interesting all this because I for one think that African- Americans, Latinas, Hindus, Asians and Middle Eastern Women are absolutely beautiful.<br/>
Not that there aren&#39;t any beautiful Caucasian women. There are plenty. I just think that the more &quot;exotic&quot;, the more beautiful. I myself am Brazilian but even thou I have a tan and brown hair/brown eyes I do not qualify as a typical Brazilian beauty as my sister does.<br/>
My mom is French/German and my Dad Portuguese/Dutch . His Portuguese is has some middle -eastern ascendant in there so he looks very Middle Eastern.<br/>
When I was growing up I too loved dolls that were blond/blue eyes but I guess when I was in my teens and twenties I changed that to a more worldly view.<br/>
I also love my skin tone. I think I have absolutely lovely color.<br/>

We&#39;ve always bought a variety of dolls, and while I know that  <br/>
American girl dolls are so very expensive, perhaps you could look at  <br/>
Target at their Our Generation dolls, which are very similar to  <br/>
American Girl, she could pick out the AG doll she wanted, and you  <br/>
could surprise her with sisters of various shades. They do go through  <br/>
phases at Target, so you might just start looking now, and check  <br/>

It seems to me that my children pick dolls that they are drawn to. <br/>
They don&#39;t pick based on skin or hair color.  They pick because of the<br/>
personality they see in that doll.<br/>
<br/>
Why don&#39;t you let your daughter pick whatever doll she wants and you<br/>
buy the dark skinned one for yourself?  How much of a self-esteem<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1039739474">~~<br/>
Why don&#39;t you let your daughter pick whatever doll she wants and you<br/>
buy the dark skinned one for yourself?~~<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s a great idea.<br/>
<br/>
This is such a tough issue for me because I DO see all the influences<br/>
that say x,y,z are desirable traits and ignore the beauty of all cultures.<br/>
<br/>
As many of you know, my family of origin adopted three children of<br/>
different skin color/cultural background. My parents did a great job<br/>
of embracing all races,but they did a lousy job of honoring my adopted<br/>
siblings heritage. <br/>
<br/>
We grew up &quot;color blind&quot;. Which is great in some ways because we<br/>
really didn&#39;t see skin color as anything to make a fuss about. The<br/>
problem with that, is I was so sheltered from the realities that many<br/>
tribal cultures and AFrican American&#39;s face I was CLUELESS upon<br/>
leaving home. <br/>
<br/>
To this day, I can be &quot;color-blind&quot; and have to stop and think about<br/>
the reality of the horrible treatment some people receive and the<br/>
messages that are present in society about color.<br/>
<br/>
When my Eskimo sisters and Athabascan Indian brother were adopted,<br/>
there was no mention of their culture, no seeking out their<br/>
culture...it became forgotten in many ways. Sure, we didn&#39;t treat<br/>
people different because of skin color, but I think honoring their<br/>
heritage SHOULD have been part of the adoption process. <br/>
<br/>
You can be completely and totally immersed into another family&#39;s<br/>
culture as an adoptee AND honor your origins as well. I think both are<br/>
helpeful.<br/>
<br/>
So maybe that&#39;s what the doll thing comes down to for me. Is her<br/>
culture of origin being honored and cherished as a part of who-she-is?<br/>
Are their books that reflect the beauty of that culture? Does she hear<br/>
the stories and see pictures and dolls and other people that look like<br/>
her? Even if they&#39;re simply available now and she doesn&#39;t show an<br/>
interest yet, I think that would be helpful.<br/>
<br/>
In years to come, she&#39;ll probably become more curious about some of it. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1042562872">That&#39;s my point, she doesn&#39;t *want* dolls with skin like hers, and it just makes me wonder if her self-esteem is suffering in some way because all she wants are light-skinned dolls.<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
When I was a little girl, all dolls were white (and most were blond, too).  I&#39;m caucasian, with hazel eyes and brown hair.  I quickly realized there were no dolls that looked like me.  In those days, all Barbies were blonde, tho her younger cousin Skipper had brown hair (and no boobs).  No one wanted to be Skipper. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
 <br/>
Instead of dolls of a different color, I focused on friends of different colors.  At that time, the prettiest little girl I knew was of AA/Cherokee descent.  Chantal was gorgeous, with flowing shiny black hair, creamy tan skin, big doe-brown eyes.  I could have stared at her all day (probably did).  No one had ever told me that I wasn&#39;t pretty, or defined for me what was pretty.  I found her pretty because I like tan skin/dark hair.  She was exotic and beautiful. That continued -- thru high school, I had Asian, Hispanic and African-American friends (I had caucasian friends, too.  <br/>
 <br/>
It must have been obvious to my Mom that I liked &#39;different&#39; because by the time I was 10, I was hearing about why it was a bad idea to date non-whites, because if I married a non-white man, my kids would be &#39;mixed&#39; and never fit anywhere.  That didn&#39;t bother me -- heck, I was white in a white family and I didn&#39;t fit, not in my family or my community at-large (very conservative small-town Oklahoma).  <br/>
 <br/>
I dated a variety of men -- my first husband was half-mexican; my current husband is 3rd generation Japanese-American (technically Okinawan).  I was amazed that, for the entire time dh and I dated (86 - 94), I regularly had people asking me &#39;race&#39; questions. Sure, Gary&#39;s obviously not caucasian (he jokes that he looks Japanese like he looks Mexican), but come on, does it really matter anymore?  Or maybe I&#39;m just the naive white girl.  Whether or not I gave a gracious answer depended on who asked the stupid question. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
 <br/>
My point in all this is, I don&#39;t think it needs to be made a big deal.  Buy her the dolls she wants.  Whatever it says about her is likely inherent.  The fact that you&#39;re aware of the potential, says to me that you&#39;re doing all you can to value her for who she is.  As she grows and explores the way she wants to look in the world, who she wants to be, help her to find the methods of expression that bring her joy.  She doesn&#39;t need to be whatever society expects of her as an AA girl, or as the child of a white family.  <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t know that a little AA girl who wants a blond, blue-eyed doll is any different from a white adolescent who wants a pierced lip and green mohawk.  Today, almost anyone can have any appearance they want.  I&#39;d be inclined to put less importance on her choice of doll and more energy towards loving her exactly as she is. <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;d like to think that someday it really won&#39;t matter.  At least I hope so for the sake of my 23yo, blue-eyed, half-Mexican son with a Japanese surname! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt; echo what Ren said, the doll is immaterial...are you honoring her culture?<br/>
&gt; Do you celebrate african holidays?  Cook african foods?  Listen to music<br/>
&gt; that reflect where she came from?  (And I&#39;m assume AA and not Haitian which<br/>
&gt; would be different but still needs to be a part of your home.)  My daughter<br/>
&gt; is Chinese, but she&#39;s also Jewish.  And she&#39;s (by extention) Celtic as<br/>
&gt; well.  And by bringing her into our home, we became a Chinese family.  (It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; a never ending cycle of hoildays around here!)  I guess my point is that is<br/>
&gt; is not enough to &quot;just love her&quot; because that does not honor who she is and<br/>
&gt; where she came from and that is just not something that most people<br/>
&gt; understand.  You have to have been involved with interracial/international<br/>
&gt; adoption to really understand how different it is.  So let her have whatever<br/>
&gt; dolls she wants, they are only toys.  But start listening to Ladysmith Black<br/>
&gt; Mambazo and cooking low country foods etc....that will do more for her sense<br/>
&gt; of self than any toy.  And you do need to prepare her because although YOU<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t see her as &quot;your black daughter&quot; the world is going to see her as a<br/>
&gt; black woman.  And she needs to understand what that means.  Bringing her<br/>
&gt; ethnic heritage into your family fully and embracing it as yours means she<br/>
&gt; will see who she is and where she came from (dna) as valuable.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-233261737">Ren:<br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
You offer great thoughts about honoring adoptees&#39; heritages.  I wonder how<br/>
this might be extended, or not, to other kinds of cultural associations,<br/>
such as signing and Deaf culture.  Hearing parents may have a deaf<br/>
child�we&#39;ve got a few here on this list, I believe�so how does this apply?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So I wonder if what you&#39;re saying is that parents should make the heritage<br/>
stuff part of the family . . . even if, at that time they decide to take it<br/>
up, the adopted child DOESN&#39;T want a doll of the same color skin?  The<br/>
child&#39;s not wanting that doll may have been a product of the parents&#39;<br/>
neglecting the heriage aspect�no books, etc. reflecting the heriage.  So if<br/>
the child is deaf, does that mean the parents should go into the heritage of<br/>
the Deaf community, get books, videos, etc. from the Deaf world?  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
While my three hearing boys are naturally immersed in signing and in both<br/>
Deaf and DeafBlind cultures, the cultures of their parents, my wife and I do<br/>
have hearing stuff for them, such as music-related stuff and also they have<br/>
tons of hearing friends of all ages.  So I know what it&#39;s all about what you<br/>
said about their being totally immersed in the family but the fact of their<br/>
being hearing is also honored.  I did find it very difficult to accept their<br/>
being hearing and the idea of having hearing stuff in my home�but it was<br/>
important that I did accept this.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, this is very rarely done in reverse.  Hearing parents rarely<br/>
learn signing and many seem to want nothing to do with the signing<br/>
community.  So it is almost always up to the deaf child to arrive at who she<br/>
is, somehow, and to fight for identity.  I may be wrong, but I think adopted<br/>
children often do have identity crises, trying to figure out who they are,<br/>
and it&#39;s sad if they have to fight against their parents to do this.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So I have to say that I agree with the honoring part; it gives more options<br/>
to the child for self-identification and expression.<br/>

<br/>
I was friends with a kid like this...well, sorta. I hated him when we<br/>
were younger. But the parents did exactly what you wrote above. Their<br/>
reasoning was that he would never cope in the hearing world if they<br/>
signed with him etc...<br/>
<br/>
Which led to him having no way to communicate effectively and he<br/>
lashed out,was angry and a general nuisance to society for many years.<br/>
As a teen he was great. But what a lot of turmoil and stress it<br/>
caused, mainly because he didn&#39;t have the tools to communicate the way<br/>
he needed.<br/>
<br/>
They should have learned sign. They should have connected him to the<br/>
deaf culture and offered up those options. He STILL would have been<br/>
able to read lips and get by in the hearing world if he chose, but<br/>
they never gave him the deaf culture options. <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine how incredibly difficult it would be to be as alone as<br/>
he was for so many years. Never around other deaf people, never with<br/>
the communication of deaf people. How sad to not make that available<br/>
to him.<br/>
<br/>
Making options available that best supports our child, in whatever<br/>
situation they happen to live within, is part of unschooling in my<br/>
opinion. The child may or may not need/want those options right now<br/>
(though hopefully we&#39;re connected enough to know what MIGHT be<br/>
useful/enjoyable to them), but at least they&#39;ll know it exists.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1728382214">Thanks to everyone who replied to my concerns about my AA daughter and her dolls.  After reading all your thoughts, I realized we&#39;re probably just fine.  We honor and celebrate my daughter for who she is, and give her plenty of opportunities to immerse herself in her culture.  And I realized her love of blond-and-blue-eyed dolls might be as simple as being drawn to what you don&#39;t have, the same way I&#39;d love to trade in my stick-straight hair for my daughter&#39;s riot of curls!  We do have a lovely light-skinned American Girl doll on its way to us, just in time for my daughter to join an American Girl club through my local Barnes and Noble.  It will be fun for her to get together with other girls and talk about the dolls.  Thanks again for your always thoughtful perspective.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-856728867">What you have written here is very appropriate for all of us to think about:<br/>
expanding your child&#39;s world and honoring them in ways that have to do with<br/>
*their* experience.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately just as you have said, that doesn&#39;t happen with out openness.<br/>
Once some inequity or difference appears on the horizon, many people ignore<br/>
or shrug it off rather than seeing it as a unique quality, something new to<br/>
them that they don&#39;t have much personal experience living with.  Though they<br/>
may have personal experience being *around* someone with a different culture<br/>
like deafness or another skin color/ethnicity, this does not translate into<br/>
personal experience.<br/>
<br/>
As parents or just living around others, it&#39;s easy to mistake proximity for<br/>
experience.  Part of being mindful is avoiding unclear thoughts like that.<br/>

That just made me cry. And know: I don&#39;t cry easily.<br/>
<br/>
But that is so sad---and unfortunately so common.<br/>
<br/>
As parents we have the ability to open their lives to sooo many <br/>
opportunities, even under extremely dire financial circumstances. We <br/>
have the ability---even in what feel like a hopeless situation---to <br/>
help them see what *can* be instead of what&#39;s seemingly been dumped on <br/>
us/them. We have the ability---even in extremely difficult <br/>
situations---to make our children feel important and perfect and <br/>
desired and adored.<br/>
<br/>
And we have the incredible and amazing ability to make them feel like <br/>
crap.<br/>
<br/>
We get to choose very moment which way to turn.<br/>

Accepting skateboarding and jazz and video gaming and <br/>

at a time and only allowed four hours/week playing time. I could have <br/>
refused to omit the chicken in chicken noodle soup!<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s good to keep our options open. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s important for *us* to step outside *our* comfort zones. To stretch <br/>
our-own-selves. Our children will learn from our example. The more *we* <br/>
the parents are willing to stretch ourselves, the more they will <br/>
too...eventually.<br/>
<br/>
Support them where they are *now*. Chances are, they won&#39;t stay right <br/>
there in that one spot for long. And if they *do*, then you were right <br/>
to support it all along! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And if they know you support the *now*, they&#39;ll feel comfortable asking <br/>
for your support later.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>that is so funny- when my white son was about 3 his best friend was<br/>
black and one day he came to me and said &quot;why am I not black like Zach&quot;-<br/>
which instead of saying why his friend was NOT like HIM it was the other<br/>
way around- so maybe kids see it differently.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-625607890">Hi everyone, <br/>
My name is Shalyn,<br/>
I joined the group because I wanted to learn about different ways <br/>
that others unschool. I am 36, been married for 18 years this year <br/>
and we have 3 sons. Our oldest is now married and he and his wife <br/>
just gave birth to their first child (son) on June 25th. We are now <br/>
grnadparents!!!<br/>
We had been homeschooling our children and we used the conventional <br/>
way with our oldest and for the most part with the twins (14). But <br/>
one of our twins has a severe form of dislexia. We had him tested and <br/>
we were told that it was the worst case that they had seen in 20 <br/>
years. So even though he can rebuild just about any engine, run the <br/>
family farm, run our house hold and what ever else you can think of, <br/>
he CAN NOT SPELL! It is almost impossible to even understand what he <br/>
writes.<br/>
My husband and I have found ourselves leaning toward a more natural <br/>
way of raising our children over the years and we LOVE IT!<br/>
It has taken our one twin and his dislexia for us to realize that his <br/>
self esteem has gotten worse because of the way we thought we had to <br/>
school him. (conventionally)<br/>
So I would love to learn more about unschooling. If not for the twins <br/>
highschool years then for our future children God willing.<br/>
<br/>
I too saw the Baby borrowers. I kind of have mixed feelings about it <br/>
because these young adults were given children that didn&#39;t know them <br/>
and it seemed to be a bit of an unfair advantage for the shows <br/>
producers. When you have your own from the beginning, you get to <br/>
establish a bond and some sort of routine, but these poor babies, <br/>
toddles and teens were just kind of thrown together without all of <br/>
that. <br/>
Anyways, I thought I would comment, hope I don&#39;t offend anyone.<br/>

California - so a complete muddle of probably almost every ethnicity  <br/>
on the planet).<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve always kept some Iranian cultural traditions alive in our house,  <br/>
including celebrations of traditional Persian holidays (winter and  <br/>
summer solstices, spring equinox which is their New Year).<br/>
<br/>
My girls really FEEL that they have a strong sense of their Iranian  <br/>
heritage even though they don&#39;t speak the language and haven&#39;t ever  <br/>
been to Iran. I think it is a very important thing to them - it is  <br/>
part of who they are. They LOVE the Persian holiday traditions and get  <br/>
great joy and satisfaction from them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1085350793">Hello Shalyn,<br/>
<br/>
I am so glad that you and your husband have chosen to unschool.  I started<br/>
unschooling two years ago when my youngest daughter was diagnosed with type<br/>
1 diabetes.  The girls are now 14 and 8 and I can not imagine having them<br/>
back in a &quot;institutional &quot; facility again!<br/>
<br/>
Take care and good luck...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-949451740">And we&#39;ve totally gotten away from any Okinawan cultural observances around here.  When we&#39;re with Gary&#39;s parents on New Year&#39;s day, we&#39;ll have a traditional Ozuni meal, and drink sake.  They always send the boys gifts on Boy&#39;s Day (traditional on May 5, not the modern Children&#39;s Day on March 3 -- that&#39;s Girl&#39;s Day to us).  We&#39;ve celebrated Boy&#39;s Day over the years, too, with small gifts for the boys.  <br/>
 <br/>
Really, tho, Gary&#39;s childhood was culturally American in many ways.  His Dad was an AirForce officer, so they moved every 3 yrs or so, and only lived near extended family for the 4-yr stint in Hawaii.  Gary was the only Asian child in his classes, until high school when they lived in the DC area, and then most of the Asians were Vietnamese or Korean, not Japanese -- certainly not Okinawan.  Gary&#39;s parents are Methodists, tho his grandparents and a couple of uncles were/are Buddhists.  <br/>
 <br/>
Beyond what the grandparents do for Boy&#39;s Day, any other forays into Okinawan/Buddhist culture have been on my part, because I do want the boys to have a sense of their culture.  Living in Albuquerque, Andy is often mistaken for Mexican (he has dark skin like Gary, and very curly hair, courtesy of my family).  I&#39;ve noticed that little old Asian ladies always recognize the boys are Asian, even Dan who has my coloring, who is starting to look Asian as he gets older (at least to us).<br/>
 <br/>
This past December, Andy&#39;s favorite uncle (my mom-in-law&#39;s next older brother) died unexpectedly. Andy was heartbroken, and wanted to know what Uncle and Aunty believe happens when they die, so I researched their beliefs.  They are Shin Buddhists (the most common branch in Japan) and we talked about the 49-day celebration they&#39;d have for Uncle.  Andy really enjoyed thinking that someday Uncle will be back around, and thinks anyone who gets Uncle for a child will be very blessed and happy.  (Andy has always accepted reincarnation as absolute fact.) We all miss Uncle Nobu very much -- he is truly one of the most truly generous people I&#39;ve ever known.  He and his wife, Michie, have always loved and seen Andy for exactly who he is -- a rare thing in so many people. From stories I&#39;ve heard, they were very much the kind of parents we try to be, supporting their kids&#39; freedom and wonder. Their kids were known as &#39;the wild ones&#39; and have grown to be<br/>
 wonderful (and successful) adults, so we can point to their methods to defend our own. <br/>
