you - conferences and discussions and readings and first-hand <br/>
experience. Next time, I&#39;ll bet you&#39;ll let anything she says that is <br/>
critical or negative just sip right by you, as the inconsequential <br/>
comments of someone who doesn&#39;t have a clue what she&#39;s talking about. <br/>
When you have no doubts, you can take criticism a lot more easily. <br/>
Smile, inside, and think, &quot;Poor her - she&#39;s so clueless.&quot;<br/>
