<div id="ygrps-yiv-384439871">&quot;&lt;&lt;my 3 youngest still do not read AT ALL, and my 12 yr old<br/>
can read (but probably not at what most would consider &quot;grade<br/>
level&quot;) but hates to read for any reason.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Weeelllll....WHY does he hate to read?<br/>
Apparently pushing isn&#39;t working so great is it?<br/>
If you&#39;re not convinced after the conference, I really don&#39;t know what<br/>
to say. Either you believe children learn better with schooling (even<br/>
though it isn&#39;t working that great so far) or you believe that natural<br/>
learning works better.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to get to unschooling, you really just have to do it.<br/>
You can read and listen and read some more, but you aren&#39;t unschooling<br/>
until you unschool!!:)<br/>
