<br/>
I&#39;m very happy for you and your son.  Your family will heal and <br/>
hopefully you can move on, can&#39;t change the past.<br/>
<br/>
My 11 yo dd and I are still trying to deschool ourselves and make <br/>
postive choices about our life together.  My husband doesn&#39;t totally <br/>
understand unschooling, but he is trusting my decision to unschool.<br/>
<br/>
On a side note:  I was feeling a little guilty over the last few <br/>
days about unschooling.  We went to the mountains and brought one of <br/>
my dd&#39;s friends.  Her family is very traditional homeschoolers; <br/>
assignments, rules, grades, etc.  When she was doing her assignments <br/>
that her mother had given her to do while relaxing in the mountains, <br/>
my dd was playing on the computer, watching TV or sleeping in.<br/>
<br/>
Then yesterday, this friend of my dd&#39;s confided in me that her <br/>
father is making her learn a lot of math because he wants her to be <br/>
a computer graphics programmer like him.  She is beginning to hate <br/>
the math and I could see resentment toward her father when she was <br/>
speaking.  <br/>
<br/>
I told her she needs to speak with her parents and tell them she <br/>
isn&#39;t interested in all the math or becoming what her father wants <br/>
her to become.  I&#39;m also considering calling or emailing my friend <br/>
and just sharing what her dd shared with me.<br/>
<br/>
Guilt has vanished, dd & I are playing chess today and having a <br/>
great time.<br/>

Sometimes it takes seeing the opposite of what you do to really make an<br/>
impact.  Whenever I spend much time around some traditional families where<br/>
the kids are treated like second class citizens, it really drills home what<br/>
a different life we are providing.  <br/>
