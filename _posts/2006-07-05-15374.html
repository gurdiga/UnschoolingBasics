<div id="ygrps-yiv-1823482659">I know someone posted about this a few weeks back. I just wanted to  <br/>
add another little story about it. I&#39;ve talked to my dad and stepmom  <br/>
a bit about how we&#39;re unschooling, but don&#39;t really bring it up with  <br/>
anyone else. Primarily it&#39;s none of their dang business, and I don&#39;t  <br/>
really make it an issue. Yesterday, however, at the 4th party that my  <br/>
aunt has every year, my school teacher cousin brought it up. Not  <br/>
hostility, but it makes me wonder what everyone is saying behind my  <br/>
back ;-)<br/>
<br/>
We were waiting for the fireworks to begin, and she says loudly, &quot;So,  <br/>
Melissa, I hear that you aren&#39;t using any materials to teach your  <br/>
children.&quot; I smiled and agreed, and told her that the method we are  <br/>
using is called unschooling. I also informed her that she was able to  <br/>
google online about unschooling, John Hold and Alfie Kohn (although I  <br/>
was struggling to remember anything, I tend to short circuit whenever  <br/>
someone asks me questions about my kids, I&#39;m that protective). Then I  <br/>
just turned back around. I think they were surprised because they  <br/>
were expecting me to get defensive and start spouting how great it  <br/>
was and how much my kids were learning. But I really didn&#39;t feel the  <br/>
need because I don&#39;t GIVE A FLYING F about what they think! :-P We&#39;ve  <br/>
come a long way baby!<br/>
<br/>
I was already ticky because earlier when Breanna was having a  <br/>
meltdown I saw her just staring out of the corner of my eye while I  <br/>
was trying to help Bre settle back down. She told me at the last get  <br/>
together that she&#39;s &#39;learned alot&#39; about autism because they have an  <br/>
autistic kid at their school. Sheesh. Reminds me of someone saying &quot;I  <br/>
love indians, I know one at work&quot;. KWIM? It&#39;s the whole token  <br/>
minority type of thing...she still knows NOTHING about autism.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it feels really good, and maybe immature like I&#39;m thumbing my  <br/>
nose at them, but please. My 11 year old was the only one yesterday  <br/>
who knew the declaration of independence (yes, by heart, he&#39;s really  <br/>
been interesting in it lately) Every one else started off with the  <br/>
preamble or (God help us) Lincolns &quot;Four score and seven years ago&quot;.  <br/>
Josh was stunned that no one, on the fourth of july, knew the words,  <br/>
but they all knew the latest scores from the sports. Heehee. We had  <br/>
been practicing earlier, trying to &#39;read it with feeling&#39;. We had a  <br/>
lot of fun! He&#39;s cool that way, he&#39;s the only kid I know who&#39;s  <br/>
stopped the govt candidates in their tracks to ask their opinion on  <br/>
the latest case law on the second amendment. :-P<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This reminds me of two stories.<br/>
<br/>
Story 1.  During segregation when African Americans were told that<br/>
they had to pass tests in order to get their voter registration cards,<br/>
one gentleman went in to register (he was a friend of my grandfather).<br/>
 The clerk told him that in order for him to get a voter registration<br/>
card he had to repeat the Preamble to the constitution.  The gentleman<br/>
knew the Preamble, but instead decided to recite the Gettysburg<br/>
address.  The clerk gave him his card.  I remember him laughing and<br/>
saying, &quot;They all thought we were stupid but here sat this man who<br/>
didn&#39;t even know the difference between the Preamble and the words of<br/>
Lincoln!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Story 2.  Last year we were somewhere and there was a reading of the<br/>
Declaration of Independence.  Emily got all upset. I asked her what<br/>
was wrong and she replied, &quot;They forgot an entire paragraph.  It<br/>
doesn&#39;t start &#39;We declare these truths to be self evident.&#39;  It begins<br/>
&#39;When in the Course of human events&#39;  Can&#39;t they get it right?&quot;  She&#39;s<br/>
right of course and I know I have heard many times the DoI read<br/>
without the &quot;When in the Course....&quot; part.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s even sadder is that many people don&#39;t know the difference<br/>
between the DoI and the Constitution, what either is about and what<br/>
they mean.  We talk about constitutional law and civil liberties all<br/>
the time and I&#39;m constantly amazed at how much better my children<br/>
understand it than many adults I know.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think because I chalk it up to apathy when people don&#39;t know the<br/>
laws of their own country.  Apathy is what gets laws passed and people<br/>
elected that shouldn&#39;t be in our laws or be our lawmakers.  It&#39;s my<br/>
opinion that we have a civic duty to know our laws, what they mean and<br/>
what our rights are just as I think it is our civic duty to vote and<br/>
serve on jury duty.  I was talking not long ago to someone about some<br/>
subject and after I made a statement the person asked me, &quot;Where the<br/>
heck did you get an idea like that from?&quot;  I was astounded.  It was<br/>
straight out of the Bill of Rights!  I meet people all the time who do<br/>
not realize that the United States is not a Christian country.  IOW we<br/>
have no national religion.  I can&#39;t remember who said it, but I was<br/>
watching a political talk show a year or so ago and one of the<br/>
panelists said (paraphrasing), &quot;It is the ignorance and apathy that<br/>
allow the gates to our civil liberties to be erased from our laws.&quot;<br/>
While I don&#39;t think that everyone should be constitutional lawyers, I<br/>
do think that people should have some interest in understanding what<br/>
it means to be a citizen of their country and what those rights and<br/>
responsibilities are.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2119589306">Well, it&#39;s important to ME that my kids know their rights so that no  <br/>
one else can infringe on them. If you read the DoI, it states so  <br/>
clearly and eloquently all the reasons for declaring our  <br/>
independence, and is an example to my children that people have the  <br/>
right to say this is wrong, we need to change it. It&#39;s not important  <br/>
to me that everyone have it memorized, but it is a cool document.<br/>
