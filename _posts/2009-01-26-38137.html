<div id="ygrps-yiv-545622525">We got the DS last week for my dd, 6.  She LOVES it!  She found 3 <br/>
games that she can play mostly on her own now that I have read through <br/>
the directions with her a few times. (little pet shop, build a bear <br/>
workshop, & my baby girl) <br/>
<br/>
   It&#39;s a lot of fun and I can&#39;t wait to get a couple more games- like <br/>
maybe one for me to play when she&#39;s not using it!  Now ds can use the <br/>
playstation and she can use the DS and do it on her own:)  She is very <br/>
happy with it.  Thanks for the info<br/>
