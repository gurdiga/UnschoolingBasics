<div id="ygrps-yiv-317716503">***How do you explain to your local Public Education board (especially if<br/>
you at one time had a child in the public school system) as to how you<br/>
base your day when they want an account of your children&#39;s daily<br/>
educational plans <br/>
how we as parents assess the children reaching their goals so you can<br/>
move forward and so forth***<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You can look at and modify and use this course of study written by Pam<br/>
Sorooshian.  Read through it and see if it can be changed to suit your<br/>
needs.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
And this curriculum by Carol Narigon, which Pam&#39;s course of study was<br/>
based on,  can be modified to suit your situation too.  <br/>
