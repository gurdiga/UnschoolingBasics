<div id="ygrps-yiv-1434997641">Please excuse this is you get this more than once - I am sending this to  the <br/>
few unschooling lists I am on - thank you VERY much!<br/>
 <br/>
Hello, all! I&#39;m a very inactive member here, so sorry about that, but I  have <br/>
a question. Wondering if any of you, or if any of your children play Halo 3  <br/>
online, with Xbox Live? My son, age 6, is a heavy player and loves it, and <br/>
does  this online, but I was hoping he may be able to locate other unschoolers - <br/>
it  will ease my mind a bit too, I have to admit. My son, Julian, uses his <br/>
Dad&#39;s  name as we can&#39;t get him his own card - his user name is Killncrap (lol - <br/>
based  off of his old highshchool user name for things - Hacncrap - yes, he&#39;s <br/>
VERY good  with computers, lol!). Anyway - if anyone plays, or anyone&#39;s <br/>
children plays,  would you be so kind as to email me off list, if you are interested <br/>
in having  the kids/you be &quot;buddies&quot; with my son? <br/>
 <br/>
Thank you! <br/>
 <br/>
