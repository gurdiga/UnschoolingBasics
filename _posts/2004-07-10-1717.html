It&#39;s a good question.<br/>
<br/>
It won&#39;t be a an issue for you personally. Krista&#39;s not going to grill you. :)<br/>
<br/>
But if you were using the HEP option here (I&#39;m in FL too -- established a <br/>
private school (Florida Unschoolers)) you would (hopefully) spend a considerable <br/>
amount of time and effort finding an evaluator who fit you.<br/>
<br/>
Not the other way around. And not waiting until the last minute and worrying <br/>
about it all year.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;d shop around and find an evaluator who understands unschooling and <br/>
deschooling.<br/>
<br/>
The progress the child would make would, naturally, be the &quot;appropriate <br/>
progress&quot; for that child. Fla&#39;s standard. You&#39;d just need an evaluator who sees <br/>
things your way. <br/>

edcation institute,,which basiclky is a &#39;&#39;private school &#39;&#39;but all they do is <br/>
basicly keep attendance records ,,,so essentually there is no need for <br/>

states who have alot of &#39;&#39;hoops&#39;&#39;you&#39;d have to jump through to be ableto <br/>
homeschool.just curious how everyone handles the de-schooling issue on a <br/>
legal stand <br/>
