<div id="ygrps-yiv-1971099382">Hello All,<br/>
I&#39;ve been getting a lot out of recent posts. Thanks to all for taking the time to share and discuss.<br/>
I have a friend who is in need of some counseling/therapy/life coaching/support re: her parenting and school vs homeschool/unschool. She has worked with Naomi Aldort in the past, but would like to try a different approach. I recall reading a post in the past about people in this group who offer these services or can refer to others who do. If you have any information or suggestions please email me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:1drflmthr@...">1drflmthr@...</a> and I will pass it on to her. <br/>
Thank you,<br/>
Sharon Emerson</div>
