the whole library system) and it is &quot;on shelf&quot;...seems like more people<br/>
would be reading this...hmmm.  Anyway, thanks for the help!<br/>

and the kids can get them before or after their haircut or if they are<br/>
just coming in with mom or dad to pick up a bottle of shampoo.  I was<br/>
a little hesitant to associate lollies with a reward for getting hair<br/>
cut since when my kids get their hair cut the *want* to get their hair<br/>
cut.  It&#39;s not a case of &quot;and if you will go get that hair cut out of<br/>
your eyes you can get a lolly afterwards.&quot;  They see it as &quot;Cool, I<br/>
get my hair cut *and* get a lolly.  Can this day get any better?&quot;<br/>
Although it never surprises me when they choose not to get a lolly<br/>
because they want something salty rather than sweet or just don&#39;t want<br/>
anything at the moment.  They&#39;ve even taken them and put them in their<br/>
pockets for later (which I generaly end up retrieving before they get<br/>
washed.)  Always surprises the heck of them when that happens!  I<br/>
think that we have the ability to be able to use what someone else<br/>
deems as a &quot;reward&quot; by not making it so.  And sorry all I can think<br/>
about is Ewww, sugar free lollies?  That wouldn&#39;t be a reward to begin<br/>
with - that would be a punishment.  &quot;Here ya go kid.  For being good a<br/>
yucky lolly!&quot;  LOL!!<br/>
