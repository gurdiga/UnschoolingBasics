<div id="ygrps-yiv-1699057183">Hi everyone<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking to get some other perspectives....<br/>
<br/>
This evening my eldest son Luc (17) and his girlfriend H decided to play <br/>
monopoly on the dining table, (Neither L or H have had an unschooled <br/>
life) Charlie (6) wanted us to join them for the game. L finds the <br/>
freedom C has at age (6) difficult to manage. L is C&#39;s step brother and <br/>
lived with his dad from the age of 6 til 14. C&#39;s best friend is having <br/>
his B&#39;day tomorrow and has been given the lego set C really desires, <br/>
this is difficult.<br/>
<br/>
We agreed a couple of rules at the beginning. C is finding competition <br/>
very difficult to manage at the mo but is also very drawn to it....(to <br/>
me this feels left over from school)...I have played monopoly at C&#39;s <br/>
request a number of times over the past week and he has made up his own <br/>
rules ( cheated when necessary), he has also been very kind, considerate <br/>
and played by the rules. I&#39;ve gone with this and played on his terms..as <br/>
I recognise that he needs to be in control and win at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t have the opportunity to get the older ones on side and decided <br/>
to go with it....after a short while C began to assert himself (to be <br/>
expected) and began rigging the dice. L and H found this hard and were <br/>
waiting for me to step in a correct C or make it fair...I didn&#39;t <br/>
although I did acknowledge that C felt it was not ok for him to lose <br/>
atm. We continued on sometimes the older two would cheat (and would have <br/>
a giggle) sometimes we all played by the rules, sometimes L got annoyed <br/>
with C, and asserted himself verbally, at one point when it got too much <br/>
he left the room, after a few mins C went up stairs to Luc and <br/>
apologised, stating he intended to play by the rules from now on....C <br/>
wasn&#39;t able to keep to this and L felt and expressed his frustration.<br/>
<br/>
Again if C changed the rules to his advantage, he always made up for it <br/>
by helping us all out. (He was much less competative potentially than <br/>
any of us, in some ways). It ebbed and flowed like this, we had conflict <br/>
and intimacy in the mix, challenge and pleasure and pleasurable <br/>
challenges, then it looked like it was all over and we (C and I) were <br/>
going to go bankrupt, C started to try and negotiate, and get the others <br/>
to empathise and not charge us much rent....this wasn&#39;t working (I was <br/>
sitting back a little, I thought we would find a way through it) C <br/>
threatened to rip up the rules...he had done so before too. L was <br/>
sticking to his guns this time and C ripped up the rules....then dad <br/>
stepped in and said that the rules belonged to everyone (he had been in <br/>
the same room on the computer) and took &#39;control&#39; of the situation, C <br/>
got more upset, shouting at his dad not to interfere....we tried to talk <br/>
about it at that point but it was too much for everyone...we stopped <br/>
playing and once C had been comforted and was occupied, we began <br/>
discussing it.....M (Dad) had was worried about what L and H were <br/>
thinking about C. What C thought of me for not saying anything? What C <br/>
might do next? How L felt responsible for enforcing the rules, if M <br/>
enfrced them then that freed things up between L and C.<br/>
<br/>
Any how we discussed it further and are still processing it, we <br/>
discussed L and H&#39;s perceptions of the game....and talked more about <br/>
unschooling.....explaining C&#39;s reaction to the change in the way we live <br/>
and work together. They asked some questions and raised some concerns.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading and if you have any thoughts they would be warmly <br/>
received. I am especially wondering whether I needed to play a bigger <br/>
role in this...another concern of my partner&#39;s was that the language I <br/>
was using to diffuse the conflict was labeling C as the problem. For <br/>
example &#39; Charlie is finding the thought of loosing really difficult <br/>
right now&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
All good wishes<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1107396282">This is not going to be your favorite response...but I have to say it.<br/>
<br/>
First, and this is just my general preference, it&#39;s SO much easier to follow<br/>
a long narrative when the names are used each time.  (Not picking on you,<br/>
lots of people on here do that or the dh thing...)<br/>
<br/>
OK here it is.  Your son Luc has to watch you and your new husband raise<br/>
Charlie in ONE home.  Charlie doesn&#39;t have to deal with visitation,<br/>
different homes, the romance of his newly divorced parents etc...Luc did.<br/>
While he was still living in chaos from not having an intact home, you made<br/>
a new one with a new man that Luc didn&#39;t choose and then you made another<br/>
kid who you now *appear* to be indulging at every whim **EVEN WHEN** the<br/>
little bugger is cheating!  How is Luc supposed to feel?  I see where you<br/>
are very concerned that Charlie never feels stepped on, but it looks to me<br/>
like everyone else has footprints on their backs but Charlie.  How is Luc<br/>
supposed to feel about this kid?  It&#39;s not going to make them bond or be<br/>
close like brothers.  It LOOKS as if Charlie is the favorite.  And then when<br/>
it&#39;s contrasted against whatever parenting techniques were used on Luc and<br/>
the chaos of his childhood, I can see how he might be resentful.  Have you<br/>
sat with him and REALLY listened to his (Luc&#39;s) feelings about how his life<br/>
went?  I would.  And then I&#39;d apologize for screwing up his childhood.<br/>
Either by picking a bad man to have sex with or not being willing/able to<br/>
keep a marriage together.  And I know it&#39;s not all your fault and I know<br/>
nothing about the first marriage but I would be willing to bet that Luc<br/>
still carries hurt from his childhood and no matter which partner was more<br/>
responsible for the breakup, it couldn&#39;t have been any of Luc&#39;s fault but he<br/>
paid the price.  I&#39;d just &quot;go belly up&quot; for Luc and REALLY listen without<br/>
being defensive because at 17 he might look like a man but he&#39;s not that old<br/>
yet.  He still needs his mother.<br/>
<br/>
RE: the monopoly mess...I&#39;ll let someone else take that but I will say<br/>
this.  I hate that game.  =P  Even Dane Cook (the comedian) has a bit he<br/>
does about playing Monopoly <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu3fxoLNZUs">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu3fxoLNZUs</a>  I<br/>
don&#39;t know that I&#39;ve ever seen a game end without someone being pissed off<br/>
and mad.  We don&#39;t even have it in the house!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I hope you don&#39;t feel attacked because I don&#39;t mean to sound like<br/>
that.  I just read your story and couldn&#39;t help but think about Luc the<br/>
whole way through and how he might be hurt and acting out in his own way for<br/>
just a little of the attention he sees his little brother getting TONS of.<br/>
And if I&#39;m honest...I&#39;m the child of divorce and I remember the chaos and<br/>
how long it took to get over feeling hurt by it.  So maybe Luc is OK with<br/>
it, but I&#39;m guessing he&#39;s not.  And while it&#39;s good to honor Charlie, it<br/>
shouldn&#39;t be done at the expense of Luc and his feelings, which it kind of<br/>
seems like it was.<br/>

-----------------------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We have monopoly in the house and will play it occasionally. The game is <br/>
fascinating to me in the way Simon and Linnaea play it. They help, they give <br/>
money and properties, they don&#39;t want anyone to fail and they work to have <br/>
cooperative ventures. They&#39;ve played at their friends&#39; houses and I know they do <br/>
the same there. There isn&#39;t any rule following, just affection and generousity <br/>
and pleasure in sitting around hoping to get to the hotels. <br/>
<br/>
When Simon was fairly young he and I were playing the Pokemon board game in the <br/>
front garden. Another slightly older boy came over and joined in with us. While <br/>
we were playing Simon got upset because he didn&#39;t catch a pokemon and I wasn&#39;t <br/>
willing to let him cheat to get it. The other boy asked me why. Why not just let <br/>
Simon have the pokemon and then the game could go ahead and no one would be <br/>
unhappy about any of it. It had never occurred to me that playing a game was <br/>
about the pleasure of the game instead of being about some sort of learning <br/>
moment about rules and learning how to lose well and so on and so forth. I <br/>
stepped back and have never really focussed on being rule bound in a game since. <br/>
It is important to make sure that all the players are willing to go against the <br/>
grain when playing with a looser hold on the rules. And sometimes someone is so <br/>
invested in the notion of winning that dispensing with the rules makes the game <br/>
absolutely no fun for them. Mostly, though, people like the idea of playing for <br/>
the sake of company and conversation and engagement instead of winning. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I&#39;m looking to get some other perspectives....&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I had a couple of thoughts while reading your post. <br/>
<br/>
What kind of relationship do the 6 year old and 17 year old have? Do you extend unschooling principles to the 17 year old? From the sound of your post, it almost sounds as if the 6 year old is unschooled to the exclusion of everyone else. Why does it matter if the 17 year old doesn&#39;t have an unschooling background? That just means that he might need more understanding. Did the 17 year old invite the 6 year old to play or did the 6 year old invite himself? If the 17 year old didn&#39;t invite the 6 year old, then perhaps you need to be more alert and find other ways to engage the 6 year old when the 17 year old is trying to hang out with his girlfriend. <br/>
<br/>
You agreed to the rules at the beginning. When the 6 year old wanted to change the rules, did you ask everyone else if they were okay with it or did you just let him do it without giving anybody else the option of giving any input? You stated that they acted like they were waiting for you to step in. Whenever one of my older girls looks for me to step in, that means that they are trying to be considerate but don&#39;t really know how to approach the situation. That is when I try to step in. Sometimes stepping in can be something as simple as saying, &quot;Hey, you can&#39;t change the rules unless it is okay with everyone else.&quot; Sometimes acknowledging the other people and their feelings goes a long way. A lot of fun can be taken out of a game when one person tries to take over and change things on a whim to suit themselves. While it is pretty age appropriate of the 6 year old, I can see where it would be a huge source of frustration for the 17 year old. I have found that it doesn&#39;t matter whether or not you follow the rules of a game as long as everyone involved agrees to it and is having fun. When somebody stops having fun, then it is time to reassess the situation especially when siblings are involved. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think this situation has as much to do with Monopoly as it has to do with sibling relationships. There is a page on Sandra&#39;s site about siblings: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/siblings">http://sandradodd.com/siblings</a> The section on sharing might be good for this situation as would the section on Responsibility for Siblings. In a way, allowing your 6 year old to do whatever he wants in the game with the 17 year old is making the 17 year old responsible for the 6 year old&#39;s feelings. I almost get the sense that the 17 year old is afraid to say anything to you about the 6 year old, which might be why he looked to you to intervene. When you didn&#39;t intervene, that sent the message that your 6 year old is more important than him and his girlfriend. Whether or not that is true is irrelevant. That could be how the situation was perceived by the 17 year old. You have mentioned a lot of acknowledgement of your 6 year old but you have not mentioned any kind of acknowledgement towards the older kids. You mentioned that the 17 year old has trouble with the level of freedom that your 6 year old has. How often does that freedom require the 17 year old to be understanding and forgiving? How often does that freedom infringe on the life of the 17 year old? You don&#39;t have to answer those questions here but they are something to think about. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1999042276">Firstly apologies for the way my first post was written. I don&#39;t feel <br/>
picked on and don&#39;t really get the dh thing but I&#39;ll look into it and <br/>
perhaps use it when next writing a long narrative.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really quite happy to receive feedback about my parenting...I <br/>
absolutely agree with you that Luc&#39;s life isn&#39;t what I wanted it to be, <br/>
it has been chaotic and he has had to manage an awful lot. I acknowledge <br/>
that he will feel resentful and pissed off about the whole thing....we <br/>
have spoken, many times and of course I have owned my part and <br/>
apologised and acknowledged how unfair it has been and how the <br/>
expectations placed on him we&#39;re far to high and put him under a lot of <br/>
pressure. We discuss everything and have a very open <br/>
relationship.....altho Luc hasn&#39;t had an un schooling life, for the past <br/>
three years I have supported him to make his own choices.....he found <br/>
school really hard and socially very difficult. He was labeled <br/>
&#39;academic&#39; but disliked school work and the control schools exert.<br/>
<br/>
He is very much his own person....he plays the electric guitar and has <br/>
gone to college to do performance music, he is into heavy metal and <br/>
directs a lot of his anger and expresses the unfairness/injustice <br/>
through his music. We are quite permissive when it comes to expression, <br/>
and allow him to explore some of the &#39;darker&#39; feelings/areas without <br/>
criticism and with support. When he came to live with us he struggled <br/>
very much to identify and voice his needs and desires, he was extremely <br/>
compliant, we have worked together so that he has felt ok to do so...<br/>
<br/>
I have got so many things wrong over the years.....we have muddled <br/>
through and it has impacted on my kids. However there was a time that I <br/>
experienced so much guilt that it crippled me and made it a real <br/>
struggle to have a relationship with my two older children. It kept me <br/>
out of their lives for a while. We have come a long way.....things are <br/>
so much better and I think Luc feels he belongs, he shares similar ways <br/>
of thinking....it&#39;s not ideal and if i could change things I would.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for you feedback<br/>
All good wishes Tori</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-518722006">Cheers Connie....<br/>
I think that perhaps I have been too idealistic about us being able to <br/>
play Monopoly together. This makes me feel quite sad, that I didn&#39;t take <br/>
into account where their relationship was at and the stages and feelings <br/>
of all concerned. On the other hand I think it wasn&#39;t too bad <br/>
considering and we worked it out and through as we went along.<br/>
<br/>
We do extend &#39;unschoooling&#39; freedoms to all our children and we are not <br/>
operating a two tier system....sorry if it came across like that. <br/>
Charlie&#39;s freedoms don&#39;t tend to impact on Luc in the present, Luc feels <br/>
envious of the freedoms Charlie has cos he would have liked them when he <br/>
was younger, we don&#39;t dismiss this, I own my part, I acknowledge and <br/>
apologise. Luc very much does his own thing.....and is his own person. <br/>
It matters that he was &#39;unschooled&#39;, I believe it helps to acknowledge <br/>
differences... and be able to discuss stuff...not to pretend that they <br/>
don&#39;t exist. This doesn&#39;t mean alienating anybody.<br/>
<br/>
Luc was expressing how he felt and having it acknowledged during the <br/>
game....Charlie too....I didn&#39;t want to take sides or control of the <br/>
game or force the situation for anyone...<br/>
<br/>
I actually feel there was a certain amount of co operation and pleasure, <br/>
as well as conflict during the game. Everyone is in different places and <br/>
stages of understanding and everyone has different <br/>
experiences....everyone has different needs and feelings....I&#39;m not sure <br/>
how helpful it is to let these differences keep us from playing and <br/>
working together....cos of the potential for conflict or difficult <br/>
feelings. I have in the past instructed my kids morally, and it&#39;s <br/>
something I want to get out of the habit of doing...maybe that could be <br/>
viewed as irresponsible or not supportive....but I work very hard at <br/>
keeping my mouth shut. It comes alot easier to tell a six year old how <br/>
to play fairly.....to be fair until we started &#39;unschooling&#39; thats what <br/>
he did, played by the rules....now he&#39;s exploring his freedom and <br/>
choices......Luc is also exploring his own freedom and choices..... I <br/>
don&#39;t want to &#39;make&#39; them have a &#39;good&#39; relationship.....I would love it <br/>
if they do..they will work it through...there is adult guidance and <br/>
nothing got too out of hand.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry think I have started to ramble.....<br/>
All good wishes<br/>

&gt; Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Monopoly madness or a fluid learning <br/>
&gt; experience??<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I&#39;m looking to get some other perspectives....&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I had a couple of thoughts while reading your post.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What kind of relationship do the 6 year old and 17 year old have? Do <br/>
&gt; you extend unschooling principles to the 17 year old? From the sound <br/>
&gt; of your post, it almost sounds as if the 6 year old is unschooled to <br/>
&gt; the exclusion of everyone else. Why does it matter if the 17 year old <br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t have an unschooling background? That just means that he might <br/>
&gt; need more understanding. Did the 17 year old invite the 6 year old to <br/>
&gt; play or did the 6 year old invite himself? If the 17 year old didn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; invite the 6 year old, then perhaps you need to be more alert and find <br/>
&gt; other ways to engage the 6 year old when the 17 year old is trying to <br/>
&gt; hang out with his girlfriend.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You agreed to the rules at the beginning. When the 6 year old wanted <br/>
&gt; to change the rules, did you ask everyone else if they were okay with <br/>
&gt; it or did you just let him do it without giving anybody else the <br/>
&gt; option of giving any input? You stated that they acted like they were <br/>
&gt; waiting for you to step in. Whenever one of my older girls looks for <br/>
&gt; me to step in, that means that they are trying to be considerate but <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t really know how to approach the situation. That is when I try to <br/>
&gt; step in. Sometimes stepping in can be something as simple as saying, <br/>
&gt; &quot;Hey, you can&#39;t change the rules unless it is okay with everyone <br/>
&gt; else.&quot; Sometimes acknowledging the other people and their feelings <br/>
&gt; goes a long way. A lot of fun can be taken out of a game when one <br/>
&gt; person tries to take over and change things on a whim to suit <br/>
&gt; themselves. While it is pretty age appropriate of the 6 year old, I <br/>
&gt; can see where it would be a huge source of frustration for the 17 year <br/>
&gt; old. I have found that it doesn&#39;t matter whether or not you follow the <br/>
&gt; rules of a game as long as everyone involved agrees to it and is <br/>
&gt; having fun. When somebody stops having fun, then it is time to <br/>
&gt; reassess the situation especially when siblings are involved.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t think this situation has as much to do with Monopoly as it has <br/>
&gt; to do with sibling relationships. There is a page on Sandra&#39;s site <br/>
&gt; about siblings: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/siblings">http://sandradodd.com/siblings</a> The section on sharing <br/>
&gt; might be good for this situation as would the section on <br/>
&gt; Responsibility for Siblings. In a way, allowing your 6 year old to do <br/>
&gt; whatever he wants in the game with the 17 year old is making the 17 <br/>
&gt; year old responsible for the 6 year old&#39;s feelings. I almost get the <br/>
&gt; sense that the 17 year old is afraid to say anything to you about the <br/>
&gt; 6 year old, which might be why he looked to you to intervene. When you <br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t intervene, that sent the message that your 6 year old is more <br/>
&gt; important than him and his girlfriend. Whether or not that is true is <br/>
&gt; irrelevant. That could be how the situation was perceived by the 17 <br/>
&gt; year old. You have mentioned a lot of acknowledgement of your 6 year <br/>
&gt; old but you have not mentioned any kind of acknowledgement towards the <br/>
&gt; older kids. You mentioned that the 17 year old has trouble with the <br/>
&gt; level of freedom that your 6 year old has. How often does that freedom <br/>
&gt; require the 17 year old to be understanding and forgiving? How often <br/>
&gt; does that freedom infringe on the life of the 17 year old? You don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; have to answer those questions here but they are something to think <br/>
&gt; about.<br/>

<br/>
Well, next time the big kids can say no if they want to and the world will keep spinning. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to find a perfect balance when there is such an age gap, I find, but if no one feels trapped I think that helps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-983705702">We just stop playing if one (or more) players are unhappy with the<br/>
situation. No recriminations, no &#39;I told you so&#39; attitudes, no &quot;never<br/>
going to play this again!&quot;, just &quot;it looks like this isn&#39;t being fun for<br/>
you anymore, do you want to stop?&quot; We might stop, we might have a &quot;do<br/>
over&quot; situation (give everyone back x amount of money for example), we<br/>
might decide to change a rule mid way of the game and move forward with<br/>
that change. With Monopoly, specifically, we often extend &quot;credit&quot; - I<br/>
know you owe me $75 for landing on this property, pay me when you pass<br/>
go next time...we&#39;ve even kept little tally sheets to keep track of it<br/>
(when DS wanted to). And, we&#39;ve played Monopoly a lot - we have at least<br/>
4 or 5 versions of the game, from a kid-targeted version (smaller board,<br/>
easier calculations, etc) to a bug version, MegaMonopoly, two Star Wars<br/>
versions, ummm I think that&#39;s it LOL<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That can happen - I&#39;m sometimes too idealistic about all sorts of things and end up blundering through somehow, not always in the best possible way in the moment. But each time, as you said, is another chance to learn something. That&#39;s one of the wonderful things about life (and I mean that seriously, not sarcastically) - we get to go on learning. Every little goof gets to be a chance to grow a little more. <br/>
