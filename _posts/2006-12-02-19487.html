<div id="ygrps-yiv-1511394455">DD fell in love with a dance video game at an arcade we went to<br/>
recently. It the one where there are five large circles on the floor<br/>
that light up and tell you where to put your feet. In front of you<br/>
there is a video screen with a dancer doing the moves. The dance steps<br/>
get progressivley more difficult and faster. While my dd didn&#39;t try it<br/>
(she thought it might be too hard, even though I told her it was for<br/>
fun and didn&#39;t matter if she couldn&#39;t keep up), she came home and<br/>
began doing some play related to it, using a toy that has several lit<br/>
buttons with music, saying that she&#39;s practicing so the next time<br/>
see&#39;s at the arcade  she can try it.. <br/>
<br/>
I know there are some video games that have this dance thing. I&#39;ve<br/>
seen them on the TV but I don&#39;t know if they are any good or if they<br/>
are designed for older kids (she&#39;s 6). We don&#39;t have any of the<br/>
traditional video games (game boy, nintendo, etc) and prefer to keep<br/>
them out of our house as long as we can. Neither of them have any<br/>
interest in them at this point anyway. When they do, then we will look<br/>
into them. <br/>
<br/>
If anyone has one of these dance games, could you let me know what<br/>
your experiences have been? I&#39;m going to check the reviews on amazon<br/>
as well...thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1682204998">We have a nintendo gamecube with Mario&#39;s Dancemat and game. Linnaea, who is <br/>
also 6, loves it. It isn&#39;t desperately hard, but can be if you want it to. <br/>
Gamecubes are really cheap, so you can probably get one and the mat for not <br/>
too much money. I don&#39;t know what they cost in the U.S., but in the U.K. we <br/>
replaced our broken one with a new one for about 30 pounds. You can do <br/>
alternate trials, and, I imagine, you could get two mats and go head to <br/>
head.  It is really fun.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve Dance Dance Revolution for the PS2 for about 2 years and we  <br/>
LOVE it. It has gotten a lot of use. *Definitely* get 2 mats. The  <br/>
PS2s (as well as the GameCubes come to think of it) should be cheaper  <br/>
since the new game systems from both companies just came out. You can  <br/>
get used ones on eBay as well as refurbished ones at gaming stores  <br/>
like GameStop.<br/>
<br/>
(At the time we were looking at getting DDR, I think the GameCube  <br/>
version wasn&#39;t as good which may have changed since then. As far as  <br/>
other video games go, the GameCube has gotten a lot more use, but the  <br/>
used PS2 we bought just for DDR was well worth it for the amount of  <br/>
time we&#39;ve played it.)<br/>
<br/>
The pads you need to get new. You&#39;re going to see a lot of mention of  <br/>
failed pads in your research but lots of the pads are being used by  <br/>
teens who quickly move up to levels the beginning pads aren&#39;t meant  <br/>
to handle. We got ours at GameStop and they&#39;ve held up well for less  <br/>
than $20 each and should work fine for a 6 yo (and mom :-). (We&#39;re  <br/>
ready to move onto better pads since they are beginning to fail.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I used to feel that way too. But it was a big mistake! Adults in  <br/>
society see children sucked into games wasting time. Children know  <br/>
better! They&#39;re hugely challenging puzzles! They&#39;re like a chess game  <br/>
with new rules for each game. Games draw on mapping skills, 3D  <br/>
visualization, reading, math concepts, strategy, planning .... Even  <br/>
when kids &quot;cheat&quot; (eg, look at walkthroughs on line) they&#39;re using  <br/>
good problem solving techniques. (As an adult if you know someone has  <br/>
already found a solution to an annoying part of a problem it&#39;s good  <br/>
strategy to check out that solution so you can move onto more  <br/>
important and interesting parts of the problem.)<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s been a bonding time too :-) I play Dance Dance Revolution  <br/>
and Pokemon and Animal Crossing with my daughter. I even have my own  <br/>
Nintendo DS (the upgraded Gameboy) and copy of Animal Crossing so we  <br/>
can visit each others&#39; towns. (I got it for Mother&#39;s Day :-)<br/>
<br/>
There was a good discussion of a book on UnschoolingDiscussion recently:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;Don&#39;t Bother Me Mom--I&#39;m Learning&quot; How Computer and Video Games  <br/>
&gt; Are Preparing Your Kids For 21st Century Success--and How You Can  <br/>
&gt; Help!<br/>
&gt; by Marc Prensky<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A profoundly counter-culture case FOR video games and how they help  <br/>
&gt; kids (and adults) learn.  He describes kids as being Digital  <br/>
&gt; Natives while adults are Digital Immigrants, and how Immigrants  <br/>
&gt; teaching Natives causes problems.  It&#39;s a compelling idea.  Our  <br/>
&gt; kids have been born into technology while we have had to adapt to it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; some quotes:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;But perhaps the most important lesson you&#39;ll learn is how to  <br/>
&gt; augment and improve what your children are learning, by having  <br/>
&gt; conversations--that they want to have--about their games.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I strongly believe that there is great benefit to all parties,  <br/>
&gt; young and old, from understanding more about this phenomenon that  <br/>
&gt; so engages our young people.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;whenever I go to school I have to &#39;power down&#39;&quot; -- a student.<br/>
&gt; &quot;Today&#39;s game-playing kid enters the first grade able to do and  <br/>
&gt; understand so many complex things--from building, to flying, to  <br/>
&gt; reasoning--that the curriculum they are given feels to them like  <br/>
&gt; their mind is being put in a strait jacket, or that their milk is  <br/>
&gt; being laced with sedatives.  Every time they go to school they  <br/>
&gt; must, in the words of one student, &quot;power down.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;It&#39;s not attention deficit--I&#39;m just not listening!  I believe our  <br/>
&gt; kids will start listening again when we begin to listen, and to  <br/>
&gt; value their passions and developing skills.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; some chapter titles:<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We have Pump It Up for PlayStation 2.  It is much more difficult than<br/>
most of the Dance Dance Revolutions and require more dance like moves<br/>
(especially on the harder versions).  I was afraid that Keon wouldn&#39;t<br/>
be able to do it, but he can and he loves it.  Dances all the time on<br/>
it.  (OK, it looks more like hopping around with him, but he can still<br/>
do it)  There are also different versions like the one where it quits<br/>
whenever you make a mistake or continues going even if you do make a<br/>
mistake.  The only thing I don&#39;t like about it is that it gives you a<br/>
grade at the end and Keon for a while was having a very hard time<br/>
getting over the fact that he was making an F.  You could make an F if<br/>
you were too slow or missed even a few.  There are definitely some<br/>
easier songs on it.<br/>
<br/>
There was a Disney DDR that was released some time back for the Play<br/>
Station (the original PS not the PS2) and I don&#39;t think that it works<br/>
with the PS2, but the game systems for the PS are super cheap right<br/>
now on ebay (Gamestop and  EB Games no longer carry refurbished PS1&#39;s)<br/>
 We have gotten some PS1 games to work on our PS2 system, but not all<br/>
do.  It&#39;s something to investigate.<br/>
<br/>
The advantage that I can see in DDR over PIU is that PIU has (at this<br/>
time) only one version although quite a few songs on it while DDR has<br/>
several different versions which I see all the time at EB Games so you<br/>
can buy them used and sell them back if you don&#39;t like them.  PIU,<br/>
though, has the arrows going diagonally front and back which feels<br/>
more natural than the DDR which are forward, back, and sides.<br/>
<br/>
There are versions that you can get that are PC compatible.  I don&#39;t<br/>
know too much about them.  I just know that the kids have mentioned<br/>
it, but there isn&#39;t a good space in the hobby room to set up a mat.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-995820293">Thanks everyone! You all have such great info.. I&#39;m not sure what we<br/>
will do at this point. We really can&#39;t afford a whole gaming system<br/>
(though I&#39;ll have to check ebay for used systems), but I have found a<br/>
few dance only systems (for TV as well as PC) that are much cheaper<br/>
and appear to have good reviews. I think we will probably go that<br/>
route for Christmas, but we also have a huge consignment sale coming<br/>
up in Jan, where I might be able to find a used game cube or PS<br/>
system, and then just buy new mats. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-53857067">I see you have decided already but I just wanted to say that we too <br/>
bought the ps2 mainly for ddr and have had great fun with it (our <br/>
whole family and extended family as well). We too bought our system <br/>
game and pads from Game Stop and couldn&#39;t be happier. :-0 It is fun <br/>
and great exercise for the entire family when it is cold or rainy <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1135224739">One piece of advice, Amy.  I&#39;ve been discussing a problem with PS2s with <br/>
some unschooling gamers recently, so it reminds me to tell you that if you <br/>
play DVDs in the PS2, there could be problems causing the whole unit to stop <br/>
functioning.  It seems to be a fairly common issue.  So just play games and <br/>
all should be well.<br/>
