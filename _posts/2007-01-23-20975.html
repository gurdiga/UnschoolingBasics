 </span></blockquote>Yes, I agree with you to some extent. The application of a &quot;rule&quot; or<br/>
&quot;principle&quot; to another person is a rule by another name, imo. I<br/>
believe one can only choose principles for guiding one&#39;s own actions.<br/>
Principles are internally driven, not externally generated.<br/>
