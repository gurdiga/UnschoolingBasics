is associated with public school.  He is very active but also very <br/>
bright and attentive to what he wants to learn.  He knows all shapes, <br/>

Fire the experts and get on with your life. <br/>
<br/>
Your children don&#39;t need all the labels, they just need to be<br/>
supported for exactly who they are. Truly.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have time to elaborate right now as I need to get ready for<br/>
work, but I&#39;m sure some parents of children diagnosed with autism will<br/>
be along shortly to explain how unschooling can free all of you from<br/>
reliance on &quot;experts&quot; or labels and simply focus on living joyfully.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1023447281">Wow, no kidding, your cup is full!  Where are you located?  That can make a difference in terms of homeschooling laws; but since you&#39;ve already been doing it you probably know what the laws are already.  <br/>
<br/>
You know, to me, what&#39;s interesting is that before public school existed, families just coped - I mean it wasn&#39;t even &quot;coping&quot;, it was just &quot;life&quot; - <br/>
<br/>
I believe you have the right to decide what is right for your children, and that you have the right to decide how your life should be lived.  You are getting some outside help - children can learn and thrive in a busy family; not too long ago, it was very commonplace for there to be an elderly relative in the home that required looking after- children can sometimes even help with that, even it it&#39;s just watching TV with them or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
And the labels don&#39;t really help, do they?  Because to you they are just your children and that&#39;s their personality.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure others on this list will be more specific with how to deal with the &quot;experts&quot; - in Ontario where I live, we are lucky to (so far) have a very lenient home-schooling policy - once you leave the system, they basically wash their hands of you - only if some nosy neighbour or interfering family member calls in Children Services, then it can get messy - but that is extremely rare.<br/>
<br/>
Not too helpful, I know - but I say, if you are willing to do it and you have the stamina - go for it lady and more power to you!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1899587785">Hi! I am new to unschooling too so I might not be able to give you advise as<br/>
a veteran but I do have an almost 6 year old child with PDD-nos. He was in<br/>
early intervention (5-8 hours of school a day) and then last year we<br/>
homeschooled him through the school district&#39;s homebased program. Early<br/>
intervention was good for him up until a point and it really depended on the<br/>
program. At some point I realized that they couldn&#39;t provide him with what<br/>
he needed. School was stressing him out and making things really hard for<br/>
him. Homeschooling him has been the best choice for him. We can choose the<br/>
social situations that will give him a chance to play with other kids in<br/>
smaller groups. He has also gotten incredibly close with his sister who is<br/>
4. The &quot;socialization&quot; that he has gotten from playing with her all day is<br/>
irreplaceable. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have decided to look into unschooling because my son seems to be happier<br/>
and learn more when he is initiating the subject of study (he taught himself<br/>
how to read). The school district was big on worksheets and it ended in<br/>
arguments most mornings which affects his stress level and our relationship.<br/>
Mostly though,  being out of school in general has affected his stress<br/>
levels in such a positive way. He has progressed some much that in most ways<br/>
he is indistinguishable from his peers. I am hoping that unschooling takes<br/>
it to a whole new level.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I too have gotten a lot of &quot;huh?&quot; when I have said we are pulling him out of<br/>
school. I know a lot of parents think I am crazy and a lot of teachers<br/>
really (At least initially) think he needs to be in school to learn social<br/>
skills. Now, after homeschooling for a year they are seeing his progress and<br/>
acknowledging that we made the right choice for him. Mainly the support that<br/>
they are giving children at school is trying to help them survive IN<br/>
SCHOOL..not in the world. I believe that services are imperative for<br/>
children that have no choice but to be in school. If one can be at home with<br/>
a child on the spectrum, I think it can make a bigger impact on progression<br/>
but it requires a lot of attention, giving them opportunities to learn, etc<br/>
(obviously!). I personally don&#39;t think that exposure to large groups of<br/>
children is what kids on the spectrum need. I think they need a comfortable<br/>
and non stressful  ways to socialize at their own pace and usually in very<br/>
small groups (1:1 at least initially). School usually doesn&#39;t supply that<br/>
opportunity. Plus they can really choose the ways they want to socialize<br/>
(nature groups, lessons, playdates, sports, clubs, etc).<br/>

*****************************************************************<br/>
 <br/>
When I got completely tired of &quot;fighting&quot; for what little services I could get for my sons and realized that even those things weren&#39;t helping as much as being home with me, my husband and I decided to homeschool.  Well, he decided it would be ok if I homeschooled and I knew that I would be unschooling.  The changes in my boys has been remarkable!  My MIL could hardly believe the changes she saw in just a few weeks and now comes over whenever she has a chance (and it&#39;s an hour drive for her).  <br/>
 <br/>
Oh!  And the happiest, most freeing, day for me came when I shredded their IEPs, progress reports, behavior logs, etc. from school.  i did, however, keep their official diagnoses just in case we might need them later for medical purposes and such.  Just the thought of getting all of those &quot;experts&quot; out of my life that never really understood my kiddos was so exhilarating!<br/>

are and do not impose on their personality.  <br/>

We definitely get lot&#39;s of &quot;suggestions&quot; that are not welcomed in the <br/>
community.  I do voice my thoughts to each and every person that tries <br/>
to give me advice that we do not ask for.  Trust me on this one.<br/>

I just put the labels there to let you all know that we are a unique <br/>
family with lots of unique abilities.  I do not call our <br/>
boys &quot;autistic&quot; by no stretch of the word.<br/>
<br/>
I guess we are already &quot;unschooling&quot; and really am not fully aware of <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-647189071">Yesterday, my sister, special ed teacher of young children in a public  <br/>
school, told me this little vignette:<br/>
<br/>
A mom brought in a little boy who has multiple disabilities - 5 year  <br/>
old. She told my sister, &quot;We never use the word &#39;can&#39;t&#39; with him  <br/>
because we want him to feel that there is always some way to do  <br/>
whatever he wants to do.&quot; My sister said, &quot;Nice sentiment, but we WILL  <br/>
be using the word &#39;can&#39;t&#39; here because there will be things he &#39;can&#39;t&#39;  <br/>
do. For example, he can&#39;t go on the slide or the jungle gym because  <br/>
the district policy is that no child with a seizure disorder is  <br/>
allowed to go &quot;up&quot; on any playground equipment.&quot;  Anyway, there was  <br/>
more of the same - my sister explaining to the mom the restrictions of  <br/>
being in a public school program.<br/>
<br/>
The next day the mom decided not to enroll the child after all. The  <br/>
principal said something about it to my sister - about it being &quot;too  <br/>
bad.&quot; My sister said, &quot;No, it was probably the best thing. With his  <br/>
mom, he &#39;CAN&#39; do all kinds of things he couldn&#39;t do here.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She wasn&#39;t being sarcastic, she meant it. She doesn&#39;t think the public  <br/>
school classroom is the best thing for all kids, but she does believe  <br/>
that many parents simply cannot cope well with the many severe  <br/>
disabilities their children have. Also, what both of my sisters (both  <br/>
special ed teachers) see is a lot of parents who do NOT at all support  <br/>
their kids in meeting challenges - don&#39;t allow their kids to take any  <br/>
risks, etc. Their kids get far more freedom to be themselves in the  <br/>
classroom than they do at home, where they may be well cared for (or  <br/>
not), but they aren&#39;t supported much in DOING things for themselves.<br/>

ready&quot; In my mind I&#39;m thinking, NEVER!!! Unschooling has saved the  <br/>
heart and souls of all of my kids. I have a really great psych who is  <br/>
totally on board with unschooling, and we&#39;ve dropped everyone else.  <br/>
When you&#39;re living life, you really don&#39;t need them anymore, you&#39;re  <br/>
meeting your child&#39;s needs on your own terms. However, I did spend  <br/>
the last two years before homeschooling cutting them out of our  <br/>
lives, mostly seeing them monthly or annually to reassess where the  <br/>
kids are and learning more about how to help them. It really was not  <br/>
instinctive for me. I don&#39;t know how much of that was autism, and how  <br/>
much was my own dysfunctional childhood, but we always found  <br/>
professionals that were willing to teach ME, not the kids, and didn&#39;t  <br/>
complain if we didn&#39;t do it their way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-506562876">Dear Kathy,<br/>
<br/>
The term &quot;on the spectrum&quot; seems so funny to me (I know posters are <br/>
referring to the &quot;autism spectrum&quot;) -- aren&#39;t we all on some sort of <br/>
spectrum?!  =)<br/>
<br/>
When my son was 1yo, I volunteered for a few months at a private <br/>
early education center (0-5yo). The woman (&quot;expert&quot;) who ran the <br/>
clinic labeled my 1yo as &quot;gifted.&quot;  I hated that!  I hadn&#39;t even <br/>
heard of unschooling then. I&#39;m sure she would say he&#39;s on some sort <br/>
of &quot;spectrum&quot; now. I know he would hate school. He doesn&#39;t like to do <br/>
anything anyone else is telling him he has to do, he tends to get <br/>
totally engrossed in an activity and keep with it much longer than <br/>
I&#39;ve heard is &quot;normal&quot; for most kids, he&#39;s *very* energetic, <br/>
emotional and strong-willed. I came to find that the woman at the <br/>
clinic had a lot of stress, was not dealing with it well, was very <br/>
judgemental and gossipy of her clients, and had a hard time keeping <br/>
employees. <br/>
<br/>
I recently enrolled ds in a couple of &quot;fun&quot; activities (Gymboree and <br/>
Little Gym), because we just moved and I thought it would be a good <br/>
way to meet kids and moms (we moved to Geneva, Switzerland where <br/>
there are almost no homeschoolers, much less unschoolers). But now I <br/>
can&#39;t wait for our membership to be over, because my son refuses to <br/>
participate in the group, which leads the instructors to degrade him <br/>
(either in actual words or just with their attitudes). We don&#39;t even <br/>
go half the time anymore.  <br/>
<br/>
The point that I&#39;m getting to is that living life with how your kids <br/>
are and appreciating how they are will support them more than <br/>
anything an &quot;expert&quot; can say. You and your kids are the experts! I <br/>
think experts can offer a lot of good ideas, but I&#39;d say follow your <br/>
own sense of what works for your kids.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of people tell me I need to think of myself, too, as an <br/>
argument to put ds in school and do things I like during the day. I <br/>
think I need some more time to decompress, too. I figure I&#39;ll just <br/>
take the money we&#39;d spend on school and similar activities and hire a <br/>
babysitter who can appreciate my style of parenting/education.<br/>
<br/>
Another idea for you if you also feel the need to stress less may be <br/>
to coordinate with other families -- your kids go over to their <br/>
house, then their kids visit you.<br/>
<br/>
Hope I haven&#39;t blabbed too much. I know there are a lot of people <br/>
here supporting that you let go of the &quot;experts.&quot; I&#39;m another one.<br/>

I recently enrolled ds in a couple of &quot;fun&quot; activities (Gymboree and<br/>
Little Gym), because we just moved and I thought it would be a good<br/>
way to meet kids and moms (we moved to Geneva, Switzerland where<br/>
there are almost no homeschoolers, much less unschoolers).<br/>
<br/>
-==-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s an active unschooling group in Germany. You might want to look <br/>
them up. Johanna and her crew puts out a slick magazine called <br/>
&quot;Unerzogen&quot;--and they have a yahoogroup: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://de.groups.yahoo.com/group/unerzogen">http://de.groups.yahoo.com/group/unerzogen</a>  They have over 300 members. <br/>
Not bad for a country where homeschooling is verboten!<br/>
<br/>
They may know of someone is Geneva---maybe just around the block from <br/>
you! &lt;g&gt; You never know!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
But now I can&#39;t wait for our membership to be over, because my son <br/>
refuses to<br/>
participate in the group, which leads the instructors to degrade him<br/>
(either in actual words or just with their attitudes). We don&#39;t even<br/>
go half the time anymore.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Is there some reason you feel the need to even worry about it any more? <br/>
No one&#39;s going to arrest you if you never go back! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Too many people feel that, if they&#39;ve *paid* for lessons or a class, <br/>
they *must* go.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t. Really.<br/>
