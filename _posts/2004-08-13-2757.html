Oh, I don&#39;t know.  Perhaps he&#39;s not saying that?  Perhaps he&#39;s just <br/>
suggesting what we all know and talk about here.  That pursuing your dream and what you <br/>
want to do for a living doesn&#39;t mean you will have to go to college.  Depends <br/>
on what that particular child&#39;s passions are, huh?  If they &#39;know&#39; they want <br/>
to be a doctor, for instance, a teenager will KNOW they will have to go to <br/>
college.  If they are talented in art or acting or a myriad of other possible <br/>
areas, college may not be necessary.  Is this what he is saying??  I don&#39;t <br/>
know...I haven&#39;t read Peter&#39;s stuff.  Maybe he&#39;s just saying that college doesn&#39;t = <br/>
success and happiness?  Don&#39;t know!  Guess I&#39;ll have to read it  :)<br/>
<br/>
Your concern got me thinking of the future, though, and wondering if it is <br/>
more difficult for an unschooling parent to be detached from expectations when <br/>
the kids get older and are thinking about possibly leaving the protective nest? <br/>
 <br/>
when they really start thinking about what they want &#39;to do&#39; with their <br/>
lives?  Is it hard to stay trusting that they will continue to learn and do what <br/>
they need to once they are teens? Do you begin to get nervous when they start <br/>
listening to the Peter Kowalski&#39;s of the world and making their own judgments <br/>
that might possible go against your hope for them?  Do you start having little <br/>
doubts and think in the back of your mind that they &#39;need to&#39; do this or that?<br/>
<br/>
My DD is only 5 but I like to see how others are feeling w/their older kids <br/>
who&#39;ve been unschooled a long time. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Warmly,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>***** For me, after watching Laurie follow her own path for 18 <br/>
years, it was easy to be detached about her choices. I knew her well <br/>
enough to know that every decision she made would be right for her <br/>
at that time or she&#39;d merge into a new path if it wasn&#39;t. I really <br/>
had no expectations, other than for her to be happy. When she <br/>
started fretting in her late teens about what she was going to do <br/>
with the rest of her life, I explained to her that the restlessness <br/>
she was feeling was her body/mind/soul becoming aware of the need <br/>
for a change and b/m/s were all searching for what exactly that <br/>
change would be. <br/>
<br/>
I never had the nagging doubts. I loved it when her mind would hear <br/>
a new idea (to her) and she&#39;d immerse herself in learning about it. <br/>
She&#39;d know right where she stood on the idea and just how much of <br/>
the idea to adopt for herself. She often took it further than it had <br/>
been taken and get really involved. Hence her title as the Resident <br/>
Radical at college. She was on the news picketing places more than a <br/>
few times. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I took her decisions about what &quot;to do&quot; with her life seriously and <br/>
supported her in those decisions. Sometimes she stuck with them for <br/>
awhile and at other times she decided rather quickly that it wasn&#39;t <br/>
such a great choice for her. She always discusses her plans with me <br/>
and she always gets my support. That way she feels free to drop them <br/>
and not worry about mom getting all weird about it. She&#39;s watched me <br/>
change paths several times during her lifetime and she knows that <br/>
there are many paths to choose from that will be right for her at <br/>
different times in her life. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not content to stay in one place in my life for very long. I go <br/>
from one thing to the other, quitting when it&#39;s not right for me and <br/>
going on to something else...with no apologies. I enjoy my life and <br/>
I feel no guilt about not finishing the pottery class (for instance) <br/>
when it made my wrists hurt. My parents have belittled my choices as <br/>
far back as I can remember. I made a vow to never do that to Laurie. <br/>
<br/>
love, Valerie<br/>

experience in trusting them and because I have a lot of confidence in <br/>
them EVENTUALLY making good decisions. But, they do make some GOOFY <br/>
ones, in the meantime, too, sometimes &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
