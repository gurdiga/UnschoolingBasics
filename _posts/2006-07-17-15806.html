<div id="ygrps-yiv-1659867364">Hi to everyone, <br/>
     I have another question.  How do you unschoolers and your <br/>
families handle the question of money management within the family?  <br/>
In other words.. do the children have access to a portion of the <br/>
family&#39;s moneyflow? Would this be contingent upon anything? (i.e. <br/>
age, or contribution in some way or some share in the family&#39;s <br/>
workload?) I like the idea of my children having access to money, <br/>
and getting practice with it and having the right to determine how <br/>
to spend it.  I&#39;m not sure how I feel about an automatic right to  <br/>
money which is not connected with earning it in any way, and I also <br/>
dislike the idea of payment for participation in any family <br/>
activity.  Is it simply a matter of sharing?  Do the children hold <br/>
outside jobs?  What about young children?  Mine are 5 and 3.  What <br/>
boundaries, if any, would naturally exist pertaining to the family <br/>
funds? I love to purchase items for my children when possible if I <br/>
believe they are needed, or if the children make a good case for <br/>
them, but tend to leave the redundant toy purchases (requested by my <br/>
children) to the grandparents.  I do like the idea of my children <br/>
having the chance to manage their own money, and make independent <br/>
decisions about it.  I just can&#39;t figure out a good system or <br/>
outlook on how they should acquire income, and whether there should <br/>
be a regular schedule for this, or specific amounts specified. In <br/>
many families, &quot;allowance&quot; becomes a reward/punishment system, and I <br/>
don&#39;t want this.  I also don&#39;t want to have the transfer of money <br/>
constitute a value judgement about my child&#39;s level of contribution <br/>
to the family.  Yet, I don&#39;t want to create the impression that <br/>
money is free or unlimited.  Are your children involved in the <br/>
decisions about the larger family budget?  If so, how do you juggle <br/>
so many potential opinions, and do you ultimately, as parents, have <br/>
the last word about it?  I&#39;d like an idea of the possible range of <br/>
positions held by unschoolers on this issue, and so ask for your <br/>
comments.  Thanks again. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Our children are quite aware of the money we have.  Maybe not the<br/>
exact numbers, but that we have money and we have bills that need to<br/>
be paid and that we don&#39;t always have money to do the things that we<br/>
want or to buy everything anytime we want.  They realize that there is<br/>
a finite amount to that money.<br/>
<br/>
They each get pocket money and it is tied to their age only in that it<br/>
works well that way and tends to be about the amount that they need<br/>
for expenditures.  However, their limited funds don&#39;t mean that they<br/>
can&#39;t have something that they are really wanting.  For instance<br/>
yesterday we went to the bookstore and Emily had a bit of money.  She<br/>
found a CD of a band that she *really* likes but didn&#39;t have enough<br/>
money for it.  I gladly bought it for her and was glad I could do so.<br/>
No &quot;you owe me&quot; or &quot;this will come out of your allowance.&quot;  Just,<br/>
&quot;I&#39;ve got the money and am glad that I can share it with you.&quot;  That<br/>
isn&#39;t always the case.<br/>
<br/>
They know that if I have the money I will share it with them.  Their<br/>
&quot;allowance&quot; is basically for that feeling of independence.  As an<br/>
example, yesterday&#39;s bookstore adventure also included my son wanting<br/>
the latest Kingdom Hearts manga.  Something I was willing to purchase<br/>
for him as I was purchasing other items including the aforementioned<br/>
CD. But for him, at 8 yo, the important thing was not so much the<br/>
possession of the book, but his ability to purchase it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1029581260">DS gets a set amount per week (currently $5 paid every other week <br/>
when I get paid, so $10 at a clip - I asked if it would be okay with <br/>
him if we do it this way because we kept forgetting to put his in <br/>
his wallet. This way, I pay him when I sit down to pay the rest of <br/>
the household bills). No ties to behavior. The way I figure it, DH <br/>
doesn&#39;t &quot;earn&quot; any moneys he might spend (I WOH fulltime and DH is <br/>
home with DS fulltime). Yes, he does dishes and laundry and whatnot <br/>
but I wouldn&#39;t tell him &quot;No you can&#39;t pick up that whatzit you want <br/>
evven though we have the money available because you didn&#39;t finish <br/>
the laundry this week.&quot; What he does around the house to make it <br/>
comfortable and pleasant is not tied to money. It&#39;s tied to simply <br/>
being part of the family. Ditto for DS. His current favorite thing <br/>
is getting the weed whacker out and going to town on the out of the <br/>
way corners of the yard (mailbox, along the base of the deck, out by <br/>
the garden boxes, etc). No money involved - DH just asked him one <br/>
day a couple weeks ago as he was heading out to do yard work if DS <br/>
wanted to use the weed whacker. DH showed him how to handle it <br/>
safely and all and off he went. This past Saturday morning, we were <br/>
trying to lay out plans for the day because we wanted to go <br/>
canoeing. DS said &quot;I want to do a bit of weed whacking so I&#39;ll go <br/>
get dressed&quot; and off he went, got dressed, got the weeder out and <br/>
spent about 20-30 minutes out there then came in and the day moved <br/>
on. We didn&#39;t ask nor was it tied to his &quot;allowance&quot;. He just enjoys <br/>
doing it and it helps out. <br/>
<br/>
His money is for things he wants to get that either (a) he&#39;s got <br/>
cash for and we don&#39;t - I don&#39;t always have cash on hand for bits <br/>
and pieces like a soda at the mini mart, if he wants one, he uses <br/>
his cash. (b) particular hobbies he might have - he&#39;s into golf so <br/>
he might use some of his cash for a round of mini golf or a bucket <br/>
of balls at the driving range (BTW we also chipped in some to get <br/>
a &#39;pass&#39; that is rechargeable so he need not have cash *every* time <br/>
he goes to the driving range). (c) being generous - sometimes he&#39;ll <br/>
suggest that he &quot;treat&quot; when we go out on our weekly mom & son date <br/>
night. Other times we go Dutch and sometimes I &quot;treat&quot;. It varies. <br/>
And so on. <br/>
<br/>
We do discuss how much we can spend for this or that - for instance, <br/>
he wanted 4 of something (a set) that would have run about $40. I <br/>
hadn&#39;t planned on spending that much (we were also picking up a <br/>
birthday gift for a friend of his). I said that I could afford to <br/>
buy the gift he had chosen and 2 of the set items. He wanted all 4. <br/>
So, he agreed that it would be okay if I held onto his &quot;allowance&quot; <br/>
in order to pay (that portion of) the credit card bill when it came <br/>
in - which meant it would be a full month (2 paydays) and he agreed <br/>
and did not whine, complain or otherwise indicate he was unhappy <br/>
with the deal for the whole time.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t talk exact dollars most of the time because once it gots <br/>
above about $20, it&#39;s just &quot;a lot&quot; to him. We&#39;ll discuss things and <br/>
he knows how to check and compare prices in the store and all so he <br/>
has some idea of how much things cost and so on. We just don&#39;t go <br/>
into major detail with all the bills - heck, I don&#39;t even discuss <br/>
the bills in major detail with DH. Fixed expenses are fixed expenses <br/>
and he knows roughly how much they are and we don&#39;t do a lot of <br/>
discussing, unless there are changes occurring (like the oil budget <br/>
amount going up when the prices increased). We will discuss long <br/>
term and variable expenses (student loan, credit cards) as far as <br/>
how to prioritize the money we have available. And when DS comes to <br/>
the market with me, we have the list of what we need and then if we <br/>
notice something we want, we jot down the item, price, aisle number <br/>
on the side and when we get to the end of the list, if there is <br/>
space in the budget, we look at those &quot;wish list&quot; items and see what <br/>
the best deal we can get is - one $6 ice cream or a 24 pack of <br/>
puddings or 3 boxes of snack cakes or 2 large containers of cottage <br/>
cheese or a bunch of yogurts or whatever (all of these have been <br/>
actual discussions - sometimes we get the snack cakes, sometimes the <br/>
cheese, sometimes 1 snack cakes and 1 cottage cheese). <br/>
<br/>
Basically, we consider the money that comes in as &#39;family funds&#39; and <br/>
we try to use them as best as possible for the family&#39;s interests, <br/>
wants, and needs. If there&#39;s something that comes up, we&#39;ll check <br/>
out prices, options, and discuss it. For instance, we were just <br/>
discussing that we might want to spend some of the money we earmark <br/>
for next year&#39;s vacation to purchase a pair of kayaks when they go <br/>
on sale at the end of the season and take closer to home vacations <br/>
where we can use them. It&#39;s a family discussion not just a grown up <br/>
discussion. BUT we do generally, because of DS&#39; nature, talk things <br/>
out between us (DH and me) before we broach it with DS - if we find <br/>
through researching that it is not financially possible, we don&#39;t <br/>
even bring up the option to DS. If it&#39;s possible IF we change this <br/>
or do that, we bring it up and discuss all the options.<br/>
