<div id="ygrps-yiv-1714759728">Hi, I&#39;m new here.  I hoped the subject might grab someones attention.  I<br/>
don&#39;t like the word &#39;hate&#39; and very rarely use it, but after<br/>
homeschooling my two oldest children, ages 13 and 9, for the past 6<br/>
years, we have all become extremely frustrated with doing school at<br/>
home.  We feel caged, restricted, and even though we are enrolled with<br/>
an online Christian school we are still subject to the Ministry and have<br/>
to submit weekly emails, 3 yearly portfolios and tick off as many of the<br/>
&#39;learning outcomes&#39; as possible.  HELP!!!<br/>
<br/>
I feel we need to finish this year out with the online school as we have<br/>
already spent the resources money, but after June we would like to try<br/>
something new.  My daughter (age 13) has a passion for reading and<br/>
writing but doesn&#39;t want to do algebra anymore... should I let her drop<br/>
math curriculum altogether?  My son (age 9) prefers hands on group<br/>
activities with his sister and me... should I drop the rigid curriculum<br/>
and let him explore his passions?<br/>
<br/>
My concerns are more with myself; how do I give-up the old ways of<br/>
teaching that I have come to despise, old habits die hard!  How do I<br/>
deal with my own fears that my children won&#39;t get their high school<br/>
diplomas?  How will that affect their ability to get jobs in the future?<br/>
And I just know that my parents will totally disapprove of me not<br/>
teaching them in a formal manner, though I know I shouldn&#39;t care what<br/>
others think.<br/>
<br/>
Reading this message back I sound like I&#39;m on the edge of a<br/>
homeschooling nervous breakdown.  I guess it really hit me 18 months ago<br/>
when my littlest blessing, who&#39;s turning two next week, was only 6<br/>
months old and my daughter stated, &quot;Mommy, if you homeschool Gabriel<br/>
until he graduates then you&#39;ll be 54 years old!&quot;  My first thought was<br/>
&#39;NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!&#39; followed closely by a strong feeling of dread.  Am<br/>
I going to be stuck in homeschooling hell until all my good years are<br/>
gone?  What about my time, my dreams, I want to explore my passions too,<br/>
I felt like screaming!<br/>
<br/>
I took on homeschooling because at age 7 my then schooled daughter was a<br/>
stranger to me.  She spent most of the day at school, would come home<br/>
and go straight out to play with the neighbors kids, have dinner and<br/>
shortly after go to bed.  I missed her, and also she was bored at<br/>
school.  There were other major contributing factors like I wanted to<br/>
teach her from a Christian world view, her teacher complained repeatedly<br/>
to me that Leah answered all the questions in class and that I&#39;d have to<br/>
tell her to stop so other kids could have a turn at answering, and some<br/>
school safety issues.  Homeschooling was a decision we made as a family.<br/>
I want to do what is right for my children but need a confidence boost.<br/>
<br/>
Can someone with unschooling experience tell me that everything is going<br/>
to be okay and push me in the right direction?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Really, it&#39;s no wonder. School wasn&#39;t designed to do at home. It&#39;s a  <br/>
*compromise* in how children learn so that the minimum level of  <br/>
education of the masses can be raised cheaply. It&#39;s production line  <br/>
education designed to be administered to 30 kids by one teacher.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really a very poor, inefficient way for an *individual* to  <br/>
learn. It&#39;s hard. It takes a lot of time. But it can be done to 30  <br/>
kids at once. We assume that schools are using the best methods  <br/>
possible for kids to learn. But they aren&#39;t. They&#39;re trying to meet  <br/>
school needs: cheap and accountable.<br/>
<br/>
Real learning needs to be individualized so it goes at the child&#39;s  <br/>
pace, through the child&#39;s interests. Real learning is about the child  <br/>
pulling the world in, not about pushing what we think is important in.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes.<br/>
<br/>
And it will make you nervous!<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling does not resemble school at all. It will look like she&#39;s  <br/>
doing no math at all. You will get very little feedback that she&#39;s  <br/>
learning. That will drive you nuts!<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s why these lists exist. To help people gain the confidence  <br/>
that even though they aren&#39;t seeing what resembles school learning,  <br/>
that learning is indeed taking place.<br/>
<br/>
I have rants about school math ;-) Truly profound mathematical  <br/>
learning comes from encountering numbers in real life and wanting to   <br/>
get information you want and need so figuring out ways to manipulate  <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
School math is a lot like learning grammar and vocabulary of a  <br/>
language you&#39;ve never heard spoken. The *hope* is that by the end,  <br/>
kids will understand the language. More often than not, they just  <br/>
hate the language and want to avoid it.<br/>
<br/>
If you go here:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.joyfullyrejoycing.com/">http://www.joyfullyrejoycing.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
and scroll down the left side there&#39;s a few pages on math and school  <br/>
math.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My son (age 9) prefers hands on group<br/>
&gt; activities with his sister and me... should I drop the rigid  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Curriculum is very comforting. We can see the learning. Or what we  <br/>
*think* is learning. We see them spitting skills and facts back. But  <br/>
is it retained? I sat through hours and hours of history in school  <br/>
and I know the majority of what I know about history came from living  <br/>
life and following interests. My history knowledge looks very little  <br/>
like school knowledge. And yet it has served me quite well for what  <br/>
*I* want to do.<br/>
<br/>
The problem with schooling is that we get the idea that this  <br/>
knowledge can&#39;t be learned outside of school. But if it doesn&#39;t exist  <br/>
outside of school, then why do they need it! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
The artificial way schools teach the information doesn&#39;t exist  <br/>
outside of schools. But the information is there and kids use it and  <br/>
pick it up. It *doesn&#39;t* look like school learning. Unschoolers can&#39;t  <br/>
see it going in. We can&#39;t tests their knowledge. But occasionally the  <br/>
kids do give us feedback that surprising things are going on! ;-)  <br/>
That&#39;s the frustrating thing about unschooling and one of the reasons  <br/>
why the lists exist, for unschoolers to reassure others that kids do  <br/>
learn even when it doesn&#39;t look like school. They go onto college if  <br/>
they want, get jobs, become decent citizens. Even better they&#39;re  <br/>
decent responsible people -- even during the teen years :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My concerns are more with myself; how do I give-up the old ways of<br/>
&gt; teaching that I have come to despise, old habits die hard!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s a rare person that can just turn their back on schoolish ways  <br/>
and embrace unschooling! That&#39;s the hard part for nearly everyone.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, when we&#39;re in school, and their telling us that all these  <br/>
hours of boring pointless work really is important, and we have no  <br/>
choice but to do it for the next 12 years, what options do we have?<br/>
<br/>
Give up? Some do. Some kids commit suicide.<br/>
<br/>
Rebel and say &quot;You&#39;re full of it!&quot; Some do. They become angry  <br/>
(because they see the truth!) and do whatever is in their power to  <br/>
fight back. (And when adults do the same and fight for what they  <br/>
think is right we cheer! When kids do it, we call them delinquents  <br/>
and drug them and put them in institutions because they refuse to see  <br/>
the world the &quot;right&quot; way.)<br/>
<br/>
And some buy into it. I mostly did (though I thought there had to be  <br/>
a better way.) They convince themselves that experts know better and  <br/>
just do what they&#39;re told to do to get where they&#39;re told they want  <br/>
to be.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I wanted to<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are lists for Christian unschoolers. Not that you&#39;re not  <br/>
welcome here! But sometimes it can be hard to answer how unschooling  <br/>
and Christianity can mesh. The Christian arguments for being the  <br/>
imprinter of a child&#39;s knowledge can be so convincing, but there are  <br/>
plenty of Christians who&#39;ve faced those questions and found answers.<br/>

school?  Remember, birthdays are great for your health.  The more you<br/>
have, the longer you live!  54 isn&#39;t as old as it used to be!<br/>
<br/>
But really, it sounds like you are all in a grind, and need to<br/>
deschool -- yes, if you&#39;ve been homeschooling strictly it can have the<br/>
same effect on the love of learning as going to traditional school<br/>
does (and advice I gave a friend recently, which has led her to a<br/>
different path, and a sense of freedom, I think.  She is in her early<br/>
50&#39;s, btw!)  I realize you feel like you don&#39;t want to &quot;waste&quot; your<br/>
money that you&#39;ve spent on your current curricular approach, but -- is<br/>
it worth dragging you all down, for the next 3 months, or however long<br/>
is left?<br/>
<br/>
And you also have a 6 yr old.  Over time, your 6 yr old will become<br/>
older, more independent and you will have more time and energy<br/>
available to pursue some of your own interests.  Who knows, your kids<br/>
may find them equally intriguing.  My son absorbed every book on<br/>
polymer clay techniques that I borrowed from the library, eagerly<br/>
trying them out.  I had borrowed them for myself, but didn&#39;t mind<br/>
sharing!  ;-)  He no longer is particularly interested in p.c., but I<br/>
saw how he was able to read and use information when he wanted to!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-248669714">Hi Cara,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the advice below.  Maybe I didn&#39;t explain myself properly :o)<br/>
My concern is not with using the curriculum because it would be a waste<br/>
of money spent, but that with being enrolled with a school I can only<br/>
spend their allocated resources money for my children if I finish the<br/>
school year sticking to their rules.  I&#39;m sure that if I pull out before<br/>
the school year ends that I&#39;ll have to pay back the money they allocated<br/>
($2000) because I didn&#39;t stick to the rules.  At the moment my family<br/>
can&#39;t afford to pay back the $2000 and so I don&#39;t see any way out of<br/>
this until we have finished-up at the end of May.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks and God bless,<br/>

Yes.<br/>

My son (age 9) prefers hands on group<br/>

<br/>
Yes.<br/>

<br/>
One moment at a time. The only one who can change how you feel and <br/>
react is *you*. Make the better choice each and every time. If you <br/>
start &quot;teaching,&quot; STOP. Breathe and ask yourself: do I want to do this <br/>
or not? Then decide. Each time.<br/>

  How do Ideal with my own fears that my children won&#39;t get their high <br/>
school<br/>
diplomas?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
By understanding that diplomas mean absolutely nothing.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 How will that affect their ability to get jobs in the future?<br/>

<br/>
Y&#39;know, your parents had an opportunity to raise you as they saw fit. <br/>
If they don&#39;t think *they* did a good enough job, that&#39;s not *your* <br/>
problem. They don&#39;t get a second chance. If they don&#39;t think you are <br/>
smart enough or wise enough to raise *your* children, maybe they should <br/>
rethink the way they chose to raise you. Maybe they could have found a <br/>
better way so that they *could* trust you to make smart and wise <br/>
decisions. If not, they need to back off while *you* explore better <br/>
ways to raise your own children. These aren&#39;t *their* children, and <br/>
*you* are an adult. It&#39;s time to BE that adult.<br/>

Reading this message back I sound like I&#39;m on the edge of a<br/>
homeschooling nervous breakdown.  I guess it really hit me 18 months ago<br/>
when my littlest blessing, who&#39;s turning two next week, was only 6<br/>
months old and my daughter stated, &quot;Mommy, if you homeschool Gabriel<br/>
until he graduates then you&#39;ll be 54 years old!&quot;  My first thought was<br/>
&#39;NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!&#39; followed closely by a strong feeling of dread.  Am<br/>

I felt like screaming!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
So your choice to have children and homeschool them isn&#39;t about your <br/>
time, your dreams, or your passions?<br/>
<br/>
You might want to rethink *why* you had children and whether you want <br/>
to spend time with them. They get older every single day. And there&#39;s <br/>
no guarantee that they will get *any* older. Decide to make the choice <br/>
to make their days with you as sweet and joyful as possible. You can <br/>
have your time, your dreams, and your passions AS WELL AS enjoy your <br/>
children. They&#39;re not exclusive.<br/>
<br/>
If you choose to send them to school, will you be any *younger* than 54 <br/>
when Gabriel graduates?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Can someone with unschooling experience tell me that everything is going<br/>
to be okay and push me in the right direction?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I have been unschooling for eight years. I  have one son who is 20 and <br/>
has been unschooled since we pulled him out of school at the end of <br/>
sixth grade. I have a 12 year old son who has never been to school.<br/>
<br/>
Everything is going to be OK. SHOVE!</div>
