<div id="ygrps-yiv-1811388259">There is a family from the Big Island coming to the conference  <br/>
<br/>
with teens. And the LiG conference diva, Mary Gold is not too, too far  <br/>
<br/>
from you, in Corvallis. She has two teens, herself. <br/>

By the Big Island, you mean Hawaii, yes?  We won&#39;t be at Life is Good, but we will be on the Big Island in July, visiting family.  We&#39;ll be in Kona for 3 or 4 days, then 6 or 7 days in Hilo.  I&#39;d love to be able to catch up with unschoolers during our visit.  Email me off-list, if you&#39;re on the Big Island.<br/>

I&#39;ll have three of my four with me...Jared (15), Sierra (12..also an &quot;honorary teen&quot; for many years due to hanging with older brothers friends) and Jalen (8).  I really wish Trevor (19) was coming, to talk about the whole transitioning thing. But he&#39;ll be there in spirit and I&#39;ll be talking about him.:)<br/>
<br/>
Two of my sisters will be there with their children. Heidi has two teens as well so there will be plenty of older kids/teens etc...<br/>
