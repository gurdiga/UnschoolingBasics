<br/>
September 2-4, 2011<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Join Carolina Homeschooler in September for an exploration of space,<br/>
astronomy, and technology in Space Camp&#39;s Pathfinder program in Huntsville,<br/>
Alabama. During this 3-day program for students in 4th grade and above (and<br/>
their parents), we&#39;ll experience training simulators and complete a Space<br/>
Shuttle mission, tour the US Space & Rocket Center, learn about space<br/>
history, and see first-hand what it takes to become an astronaut. The<br/>
registration deadline is May 31. <br/>
