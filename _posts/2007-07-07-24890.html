<div id="ygrps-yiv-883414089">I posted a couple of weeks ago about my 4 yo and some issues we were having<br/>
with her.  I received a few replies from some of you here and I just wanted<br/>
to pop in and say thank you.<br/>
<br/>
I think I posted about my frustration and my feelings of sending everyone to<br/>
FT daycare so I could get myself back together on a Thursday.by Saturday I<br/>
was in bed with a mother case of mastitis.  By the time Monday came around I<br/>
still felt like crap and my oldest had a case of Strep that had been treated<br/>
with antibiotics and was still on day 17.he already has a heart murmur so<br/>
you can imagine my level of fear and stress!<br/>
<br/>
I was too ill to get him to the dr so dh took him - found out it was not<br/>
strep afterall and I was on the mend by Tuesday.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I posted here during the peak of my frustration (so I thought) but it<br/>
actually got worse.  I had plenty of time to reflect on the posts I received<br/>
here and I also had some time to just &quot;be&quot; and reflect on everything.<br/>
Honestly the mastitis came at the perfect time (doesn&#39;t it always?).<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This is what I did to get back on track.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
#1)went from about 1 pot of strong coffee per day to NO COFFEEEEEEE!!!<br/>
<br/>
I did not realize my caffeine consumption was a problem.  For me it produces<br/>
lots of energy but it was a type of energy that is not productive when<br/>
trying to be patient and calm.  It was mopre of a &quot;gotta go gotta go&quot; type<br/>
of energy that resulted in lots and lots of cleaning as if I were in a<br/>
cleaning race yet I was never able to finish the race which led to lots of<br/>
frustration and not enough &quot;be&quot;ing with my kids during the day.  I think the<br/>
coffee was feeding my feelings of dh getting to be the fun parent as I would<br/>
bust ass being productive all day and then he would come home and get<br/>
tackled for playtime.while I picked up the kitchen!<br/>
<br/>
 I felt that I was spending time with my kids.we were together all day,<br/>
rushing to playdates and dance/gym classes and running to other social<br/>
engagements but not enough time just laying about and seeing which project<br/>
would naturally come up next. <br/>
<br/>
Of course the caffeine probably didn&#39;t help my mastits either so that is a<br/>
thing of the past for me.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always been a coffee girl, even during my pregnancies and since I&#39;ve<br/>
birthed big fat healthy babies who sleep well and are not often fussy I<br/>
assumed we were in good shape.  You can&#39;t really tell until you get off the<br/>
hard stuff that it is really not good for gentle parenting.even if everyone<br/>
sleeps well inspite of it, it is still not ideal.  So that&#39;s that.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
#2) kobe and I have spent more alone time together and have talked a lot<br/>
more.  I see an awakening in her and it has really been beautiful.  Now,<br/>
when she needs ore attention - she flat out asks for it.  I am so proud of<br/>
her.  She has expressed to me that all she wants to do is just chill out<br/>
with me.  I am so happy that she can just tell me now vs a few weeks ago.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I could elaborate more but I think I will leave it at this.  Most of her<br/>
issues that I posted here a few weeks ago were actually my issues, and mine<br/>
alone.  I am so thankful for that bout of mastits because without it I don&#39;t<br/>
think I would have had the time or shall I say taken the time to mull it all<br/>
over.  We all know what causes mastits but for some reason I really didn&#39;t<br/>
see it coming.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to thank all of you for your insight and for taking time to<br/>
share with me - it has literally been life changing.<br/>

Isn&#39;t that interesting? I admit to learning the same thing over the<br/>
years...most everything that frustrated me was really about ME. Not<br/>
playing the blame game, but looking within is really the answer.<br/>
<br/>
The more I grew into RU, the more I realized it&#39;s about the parents<br/>
changing, about us seeing things with new eyes and adjusting our OWN<br/>
behavior not our children&#39;s.:)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh Ren, this is TRUE! TRUE! TRUE!  I&#39;ve always been so focussed on<br/>
&quot;wanting the best&quot; for my kids, that it eventuated into CHOOSING those<br/>
things FOR my kids (i.e. healthy, pure foods) when *I* was eating a lot<br/>
of junk food on my own when the kids weren&#39;t watching!!  We have<br/>
behavioural issues with certain foods (although I&#39;ve not been able to<br/>
ascertain specifics), so I&#39;ve always been really controlling about food<br/>
(with good reason, really - my son can get quite violent in his food<br/>
reactions!).  But the end result is that the kids CRAVE junk food and go<br/>
beserk when they have the opportunity to eat it.  Now I&quot;m beginning to<br/>
get worried that they&#39;ll end up with all these food issues when they get<br/>
older.  I mean, if nothing else, I imagine there&#39;ll be a LOT of bingeing<br/>
going on!!  I really do want the best for my kids, and for them only to<br/>
consume natural, healthy food (or &quot;treat&quot; foods that don&#39;t have<br/>
artificial chemicals in them) BUT..... I always try to sneak some<br/>
chocolate into the trolley for me!!  We buy colour-less vanilla ice<br/>
cream for the kids, and my DH & I eat Sara Lee Chocolate when the<br/>
kids&#39;ve gone to bed!!  I&#39;m becoming painfully aware of how hypocritical<br/>
this is.  I&#39;m expecting one thing of them, but doing another thing<br/>
myself.  And how do I expect them to learn to listen to their bodies and<br/>
make wise, healthy choices once they leave home, if I&#39;M making all those<br/>
choices FOR them now!!  I look around me at the shops and I see the<br/>
typical adult buying lots of junk food and binge eating.  I wonder how<br/>
different their food obsession would be if they&#39;d been allowed to choose<br/>
freely from a smorgasbord of food options when they were growing up?<br/>
<br/>
I had originally thought that perhaps I could just keep the<br/>
fridge/cupboard stocked with healthy food choices, and lighten the<br/>
control on when/where they can eat (I mean, seriously, my husband gets<br/>
cranky at them if he sees them eating an APPLE!  &quot;Who did you ask if you<br/>
could eat that???&quot;  &quot;It&#39;s nearly dinner time; you just can&#39;t eat that<br/>
now!&quot;  &quot;You&#39;ve got to ask first; you can&#39;t just go helping yourself to<br/>
food whenever you want to!&quot;  &quot;You can&#39;t live on white bread and peanut<br/>
butter - make a salad sandwich for yourself and your siblings!&quot;).  But I<br/>
still have the craving issue at the shops, or when we&#39;re out with<br/>
friends (which is often).<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;m thinking that perhaps the most important thing of all is ME<br/>
MODELLING WISE FOOD CHOICES!!!!!  I can&#39;t just expect THEM to do it<br/>
while I eat whatever I like - terrible eating habits, actually!  I also<br/>
need to stock more of a VARIETY OF FOODS in the pantry etc - even<br/>
perhaps some &quot;junk&quot; food???  But what about the behaviour issues that<br/>
seemingly result from most artificial additives etc.   Surely I should<br/>
keep those foods out of the house, and try to provide information<br/>
whenwe&#39;re out and he&#39;s wanting to make unhealthy food choices!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, keen for some thoughts on this issue!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Karen<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-674710682">Wow, I&#39;m right there with you sister. I&#39;ve improved (miraculously) about the junk food on the side. It&#39;s only happened this week, actually, when I looked at how rediculous I look sneaking junk food on the side so my son won&#39;t see it and ask for what I prefer his body not ingest. If it&#39;s not good for him, why the heck am I stuffing my face with it? I made a rule for myself : If I grab a handfull of chocolate morsels, I take one to my son. If I make a bowl of icecream, I get him one, too. I&#39;ve lost 5 lbs this week ! <br/>
  We still have the issue of what my DH affectionately calls &#39;the Lisa syndrome&#39;, whereby each time we leave the house, I am suddenly starving and want to stop by a fast food place. I&#39;m better, but my son has LS now! I haven&#39;t implemented anything yet, but I think I&#39;ll start packing a fun snack for when we leave the house. He loves the YoBaby&#39;s &#39;YoKids&#39; organic yogurt in the pouches. Let me tell you, THAT alone has changed my son&#39;s daily request for snacks. He usually would beg for a cookie or icecream anytime he was hungry (for a long time that was how he expressed hunger), but now he wants yoghurt. It&#39;s all in the packaging, and he thinks he&#39;s getting away with something! <br/>
  Anyway, good luck! I hope you find a solution that works for you. If so, let me know...maybe it&#39;ll help here, too! <br/>
  Lisa O<br/>
