I read your blog with great interest, and I always carry with me some of the things you say <br/>
throughout my day/week/life. As you know we do not unschool, although I try to give my <br/>
children as much control over their lives as I feel is appropriate. I have done unschooling <br/>
&quot;experiments&quot; before... and maybe I didn&#39;t do it for long enough to see it &quot;work,&quot; but my <br/>
kids consistently made the choices that I expected they would... they watched tv and <br/>
played computer games nonstop... and did almost nothing else. They ate junk food <br/>
nonstop. I knew there would be a period of excitement and overindulgence, but after a <br/>
week I was feeling very uncomfortable with the whole thing, and was very glad to get back <br/>
to a more balanced approach. Honestly- I think my kids were glad to have some structure <br/>
and guidance again, too. Please don&#39;t take this as an argument or criticism- I just wanted <br/>
to share my own experience with you. You have such a wonderful family, and clearly what <br/>
you do is working for you- it just didn&#39;t work for us. Also, I do not feel that children are <br/>
inherently lazy, necessarily (some are- just as some adults are- everone is different) but I <br/>
know that in my home there are &quot;chores&quot; that simply must be done- and because there are <br/>
five people living here, it takes five (well, ok, 4- baby doesn&#39;t count yet, LOL) people to do <br/>
what is necessary. It would be nice if I could just let them choose what chores they wanted <br/>
to do and when... but 1-they aren&#39;t necessarily aware of what &quot;needs&quot; to be done, and 2-<br/>
certain things are not &quot;fun,&quot; - in fact they are a real drag, like picking up dog poop- yet <br/>
need to be done regularly. I feel this builds strength of character, which, &quot;no&quot;- isn&#39;t <br/>
something children are necessarily born with, but something they build in themselves, <br/>
sometimes with the help of an adult an some good old hard work.<br/>
Anyway- I&#39;m totally rambling. I&#39;m really not &quot;disagreeing&quot; with you, although I know it <br/>
sounds like it... I just think each child is unique, each family is unique, and balance and <br/>
guidance are good things. Just because I provide my children with boundaries and chores <br/>
does not mean that I am an authoritarian dictator. I feel that sometimes people who think <br/>
they are openminded really aren&#39;t... even if they are doing something &quot;new&quot; and <br/>
&quot;progressive,&quot; there is still a sense that they are &quot;right&quot; and others are &quot;wrong.&quot;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1080627069">Hey Melissa, <br/>
<br/>
I saw you quoted my blog post about Jacqueline. Thanks, I&#39;m glad you <br/>
enjoyed it. <br/>
<br/>
I think you did a terrific job replying to her and I also saw that <br/>
she was open to your reply and responded back. :-) I think the fact <br/>
that she was able to bring her concerns to you and your blog says a <br/>
lot about you. Keep it up! <br/>
