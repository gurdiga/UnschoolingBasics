<div id="ygrps-yiv-710252943">Should homeschoolers be concerned about the ruling in the Long child abuse case in CA? I think so. If the three judges who ruled in this case were concerned only with the specifics of the Long case, why did they go so much into the question of the legal status of home schooling and then publish their ruling so that it becomes part of legal precedent in CA? At the very least, the ruling provides quotes useful to the opponents of homeschooling everywhere. I think weâ€™d better follow this carefully and be prepared. <br/>
<br/>
Or maybe go on the offensive ourselves. Can we quote what the CA law says is the obligation of the government schools and ask how well they are fulfilling their obligations. Could someone mount a class action lawsuit against CA schools for not fulfilling their legal obligations? <br/>

Nursing is the biological norm for mothers and babies. It is a relationship that links the baby&#39;s immune system to the mother&#39;s, <br/>
provides the baby with stimulation and connection while providing the mother with stress reducing hormones. It even feeds the baby.<br/>
