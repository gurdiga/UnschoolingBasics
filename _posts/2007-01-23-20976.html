<div id="ygrps-yiv-949079216">To recap,<br/>
<br/>
My daughter fell on her ankle three weeks ago and hurt it. It never <br/>
swelled but she wouldn&#39;t walk on it. Two dr appts, one negative x <br/>
ray visit , negative blood work (lyme disease, etc) and a <br/>
chiropractor visit later, she still won&#39;t walk on it.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;ll stand on it periodically and say &quot;Mommy! It doesn&#39;t hurt!&quot; <br/>
and that&#39;s it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m far from a perfect unschooler, unfortunately, but I am *trying* <br/>
to honor her not wanting to walk on it even if I do get short with <br/>
the issue from time to time. I was told to come back to the dr&#39;s if <br/>
she wasn&#39;t walking on it by last Monday. I&#39;ve not wanted to go back <br/>
b/c they are just going to push both she and I and that&#39;s not what I <br/>
want, nor is it going to work.<br/>
<br/>
She is a VERY determined girl and does not do things unless they are <br/>
her idea, on her time. <br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else gone through something similiar to this? I am at a <br/>
loss as to what to do with her. She weighs a heavy 40 lbs and <br/>
carrying her around is wearing on my body. I carry her as little as <br/>
possible, use strollers and let her crawl (or she slides across the <br/>
floor, knees bent, feet under her bum).<br/>
<br/>
I know this will be a blip in time in years from now but, for right <br/>
now, it&#39;s long.<br/>
<br/>
For the record, she just got out of diapers but, as for a regression <br/>
stage, this has lasted pretty long. We&#39;re into our 3rd and a half <br/>
week.<br/>
<br/>
Input is appreciated,<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-655103393">Hi Tonya,<br/>
<br/>
As 3 1/2 year olds can&#39;t &#39;lie&#39; for 3 weeks, if she tells you her ankle <br/>
hurts, it most likely does. A sprain would not show up on an x-ray, <br/>
and can be painful for well over a month. You could try a soak with <br/>
warm water to see if that makes her ankle feel better, and even <br/>
support it with an elastic wrap. Just be sure it isn&#39;t too tight, and <br/>
remove it at night. You might want to consider medicating her with <br/>
children&#39;s tylenol to relieve pain. <br/>
I remember frequent ankle &#39;twists&#39; from my childhood, and even tho <br/>
there was no swelling/bruising, it still hurt. Your daughter needs to <br/>
know that you take her seriously, but don&#39;t focus too much attention <br/>
on her injury. Best of luck, and of course, if her ankle isn&#39;t <br/>
improving, she needs to see the doctor again, perhaps an orthopedic <br/>
physician.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1164699206">Tonya, I&#39;d take her back to the dr. I agree with the other poster who<br/>
said if she was just doing it for attention, you would have seen her<br/>
forgetting about it and walking/running then going back to &quot;milking<br/>
it&quot;. It is possible that she chipped a small piece off a bone, had a<br/>
stress fracture, or compressed the ankle bones. There may also be<br/>
inflammation in the joint that you can&#39;t see/feel on the outside. <br/>
<br/>
Have you attempted to give her an anti-inflammatory for a few days<br/>
(motrin, advil, etc - not tylenol)? If there is interior swelling,<br/>
this will help. You should probably pass this by the dr. first, as<br/>
he/she may give you increased dosage limits, or an alternative. <br/>

choosing not to walk?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1235954421">Also too - where was the x-ray taken - was it only of the foot & ankle?  I had a friend that her 2 year old fell and complained of pain in ankle - when they took x-rays, nothing.  Then her dd was still crying in pain and not walking on it, so she took her to her dr (instead of er) & insisted that they x-ray the whole leg & guess what - she had a broken leg.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1777504393">For the record... when I was in high school I came down wrong on my <br/>
ankle during a dance move.  I went to the emergency room and had an x-<br/>
ray and they said it was just sprained.  I limped/walked on it for a <br/>
week in terrible pain until my mother took me back.  They did another <br/>
x-ray and sure enough....I&#39;d broken my ankle.  I ended up in a cast <br/>
for 6 weeks.<br/>
<br/>
I vote you take her back to the doctor.  <br/>
<br/>
It would be the rarest of 3yr olds that would have either the <br/>
cognitive abilities or the stamina to keep up a charade for so long.  <br/>
And assuming she did -- there would likely be an underlying cause <br/>
maybe you can discover at the doc.  Sometimes doctors ask just the <br/>
right questions for kids to give a clearer explanation.  (Like: When <br/>
does your foot hurt?  &quot;My foot hurts when my mommy doesn&#39;t carry <br/>
me.&quot;)  On the off-chance such a scenario came true, at least you&#39;d <br/>
then be able to address the situation more directly.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-977779677">I thank you all for your support.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the update.<br/>
We went to the drs tonight and both a nurse practioner (who seemed <br/>
alarmed at the duration of this) and a Pedi doc thoroughly examined <br/>
her. She came out with flying colors. The Pedi doc laid INTO her <br/>
leg, foot and ankle and there wasn&#39;t a wince. But when he went to <br/>
put her to stand on the floor, she lifted her knees and wouldn&#39;t put <br/>
her feet down.<br/>
<br/>
For the record, she calls it her &#39;boo boo foot&#39; but, after a lengthy <br/>
conversation with me tonight, she says she doesn&#39;t *want* to walk on <br/>
it. &quot;I will in two days&quot; The dr thinks it may be for secondary <br/>
reasons. The nurse practioner was alarmed but befuddled.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s going to get xrays tomorrow (she did have full set the first <br/>
time, to reply to that inquiry. Hips, knees, ankles) She did have <br/>
blood work that looked for lyme or arthritis. She&#39;s even missing her <br/>
art class (that she enjoys) and a music time with me and a good <br/>
friend for the xrays.<br/>
<br/>
I will let you all know tomorrow of the outcome. I am truly baffled.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Tonya,<br/>
<br/>
I think when your daughter said she doesn&#39;t *want* to walk on her ankle, she <br/>
is telling you the truth.  Her mind is connected to that leg and her head is <br/>
telling her (and she&#39;s telling you) to keep off it.  My 6 y.o. foster son broke <br/>
his leg and was in a cast for 6 weeks. He refused to put weight on it after <br/>
the cast had been off for more than a week.  The ortho said it was normal and <br/>
common after a painful injury in a young child.  Its been three weeks and he is <br/>
now limping around on it, but still barely putting weight on it. It is his <br/>
fear of re-injuring his &quot;bad* leg as he calls it that is preventing him from <br/>
walking.  It sometimes takes the mind a bit longer to heal.<br/>
<br/>
If you do not want to keep carrying her, you might want to try crutches, a <br/>
walker, or a wheelchair.  We rented a wheelchair for $75.00/month and it was <br/>
well worth it.  I bet she&#39;d love being pushed around by you and her brothers.  <br/>
You could turn this into a fun and adventurous memory.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
Robin, waiting for that update from the x-rays today...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1912062825">Well,<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I haven&#39;t written. I&#39;m kind of exasperated. The xrays were <br/>
negative again. <br/>
<br/>
And then that night, at bedtime, she stood on both feet. I gently <br/>
said &quot;Oh yay, see? You can stand. Good for you!&quot;<br/>
But yesterday morning she woke and wouldn&#39;t walk again. And I <br/>
decided to stop carrying her so we&#39;ve been home. I&#39;ve been giving <br/>
her lots of extra hugs and love and she did stand on it again <br/>
yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what we&#39;ll do next. I&#39;m going to stay positive. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Thank you<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1507632194">Something I&#39;ve been meaning to write and delayed on..is fear. Sam, when he was about <br/>
two, jumped off a table and got a hairline fracture on his tibia. Long after it was healed, he <br/>
was unable to walk on it. He had internalized the fear of pain, and it was very difficult for <br/>
him to 1) trust his body and 2) trust that it was healed. He called it his &#39;booboo foot&#39; for <br/>
over a year. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s entirely possible that she pulled a ligament or some such. Those can be slow to heal, <br/>
and even after being okay catch you off guard with twinges. If she is afraid of it hurting, <br/>
even if it doesn&#39;t hurt all the time, it&#39;s possible that ghost pain pops up, or she doesn&#39;t <br/>
know how to verbalize that she&#39;s afraid it will hurt. Especially if it does twinge every once <br/>
in a while, then she KNOWS that feeling okay now doesn&#39;t always mean that it will feel <br/>
okay. <br/>
<br/>
I will say that most kids at five yo aren&#39;t coordinated enough for crutches, and it&#39;s difficult <br/>
to find them that small. However, united cerebral palsy often has walkers in that size, and <br/>
they have rental programs or even let you borrow for free. We got one for a few weeks <br/>
when Emily&#39;s spiderbite turned septic.<br/>
