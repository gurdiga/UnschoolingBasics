<div id="ygrps-yiv-291745298">Dear All,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading this list for some time and this is my first time <br/>
posting.  I admit. I&#39;m scared!   I&#39;m very new to the idea of mindful <br/>
parenting and unschooling, but &#39;thanks&#39; to you guys, I had to leave the <br/>
Love and Logic seminar my husband and I went to this last weekend within <br/>
the first hour.  We had signed up for it in January, and then I joined <br/>
this group and now I can&#39;t stand the most mainstream style of parenting <br/>
out there.  Thanks a LOT.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
I have a five year old daughter and a two and a half year old son.  My <br/>
question is, how does mindful parenting deal with sibling fights at this <br/>
age.    Like, when my daughter takes a toy my son is playing with and <br/>
when he obviously wants it back, she ignores his requests, whether he <br/>
asks for it verbally or via screaming.  Among the many responses I&#39;ve <br/>
had, many of them not ones I&#39;m proud of...the one  that has worked most <br/>
often is asking her if he sounds like he&#39;s happy or unhappy.  And then <br/>
seeing if she can think of anything that may make him happy.  But I <br/>
don&#39;t see her wanting to stop making him upset in the first place. Can <br/>
someone assure me that this will change at some point in her growing up <br/>
life?  They get along well a lot of the time...it&#39;s that 10% that&#39;s got <br/>
me stumped. <br/>
<br/>
I wonder if others can share their experience with their kids... <br/>
<br/>
Thanks a lot,<br/>
<br/>
Jill<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It will change. Kids don&#39;t start life with a whole lot of empathy. <br/>
Its something that grows with time, and like anything else with kids <br/>
the hows and whens are going to be somewhat variable and not always <br/>
look the way you expect it to. Empathy also waxes and wanes a bit <br/>
depending on how well a child&#39;s needs are being met overall. So if <br/>
your dd is having a rough day, she&#39;s going to have less energy left <br/>
over for empathy toward her bro. That&#39;s true for moms, too! Its <br/>
tough to be patient and kind and empathize with our kids when we&#39;re <br/>
tired, stressed, need to pee....<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What helps the most, ime, is to spend as much time with the kids as <br/>
possible - right down on the floor if you can. Try not to get <br/>
wrapped up in things like housekeeping or projects when they are <br/>
playing close together. You *see* so much more when you&#39;re right <br/>
there and its easier to see trouble coming and so head it off. If <br/>
you need &quot;something to do&quot; get a magazine or really simple hand-<br/>
work. Something that doesn&#39;t take a huge amount of attention and <br/>
that you can drop at a moment&#39;s notice. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Only 10%????? Wow, I don&#39;t think any two members of my family get <br/>
along that well! We&#39;re all so opinionated and independent.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-570476311">One of the things that I did when Simon was 5 and Linnaea was 2 was try and help Linnaea find other things. She often wasn&#39;t really interested in the specific item, just wanted something or someone to play with. If it was the specific item I would ask Simon when he was going to be done with it, and Linnaea and I would do something else while waiting. At 2 it was fairly easy to find other things to do. If it happens now, when they are 11 and 8 it is less easy to find something else to distract their focus. So, for example, if they both want to watch a different television show that is on at the same time, it may some doing. Often the show is on an hour later on +1 channel, and a couple of channels in the UK have on-line viewing as well, so those are some options I can quickly explore. Sometimes Simon or Linnaea will have seen the show before and willrelease the television to the other one without any real angst. Sometimes I can&#39;t come up with a solution<br/>
 and there is disappointment and anger. Sometimes the solution doesn&#39;t matter, it is the thing, the control, the whatever that was important. The key, for me, is being present, making sure that it doesn&#39;t spiral up and out, and not getting angry or frustrated or invested in fixing it myself. As soon as my emotion and energy becomes a part of the mix, it gets explosive. <br/>
