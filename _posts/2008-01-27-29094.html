<div id="ygrps-yiv-519005805">Greetings,<br/>
  I&#39;m part of a growing community with a focus on relationship (with <br/>
self, one another and our relations in the natural world) called the <br/>
Teaching Drum Outdoor School.  We are a school by name, but our <br/>
vision is one of seeking relationship directly &#8211; by living it, not <br/>
through a teacher, book or class.  We are also home to a growing <br/>
children&#39;s culture and are passionate about providing the best <br/>
possible environment whereby children can discover themselves and in <br/>
the process share with us their gifts so vital to our own journeys <br/>
of self-discovery.  To this end we are seeking more children and <br/>
parents who would live to explore living as part of our circle and a <br/>
webpage <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.teachingdrum.org/childrensculture.html">http://www.teachingdrum.org/childrensculture.html</a> <br/>
chronicling our vision of relationship (with children and <br/>
otherwise.)  As of now the page is still being woven together and is <br/>
crafted together with stories, pictures and quotes of our lives <br/>
here, with more to come.  To find out more about the school or to <br/>
schedule a visit e-mail <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:balance@...">balance@...</a>, or for more <br/>
children&#39;s culture specific information, email me directly @ <br/>

In gratitude for your own journeys,<br/>
-Marcus<br/>

&quot;Let us put our heads together and see what life we will make for <br/>
our children.&quot;- Tatanka lotanka (Sitting Bull)<br/>
<br/>
On a more personal note...<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate your being open to hosting my intro here. I&#39;m <br/>
canvassing a lot of unschooling/natural parenting forums in an <br/>
attempt to get the word out about Teaching Drum. By &quot;children&#39;s <br/>
culture&quot; I mean a group of children with their own culture. This <br/>
happens wherever there are groups of children - they have their own <br/>
games, language, conflict-resolution techniques, ect. We are <br/>
intentionally trying to foster this, and the difference between <br/>
saying &quot;we just want more kids&quot; is that we know it&#39;s what our <br/>
children need. In school and in sports they are clustered into peer <br/>
groups where they learn they need to compete for <br/>
attention/acceptance. But humans weren&#39;t evolved to learn this way. <br/>
In the small clans where we evolved our natural learning styles <br/>
children would spend their days with those older and younger than <br/>
them, following in the example of the older and providing a bridge <br/>
for the younger. Right now our school community (by the way - <br/>
the &quot;school&quot; is quite unique, I might call it the most radical <br/>
facilitated-unschooling experience for adults that exists on this <br/>
planet) is home to 3 children. Already in their day-to-day play I <br/>
can see how much more tuned in to each other they are (the 5 year <br/>
old wants to learn much more from the 6 year old than from any of <br/>
the adults). Right now there are big gaps 2years-&gt;5 years-&gt;6 <br/>
years-&gt;21 years. Filling in those gaps is key for the children&#39;s own <br/>
fulfillment (having someone to guide and put their new learning to <br/>
practice, and having guides of their own) and for the maturation of <br/>
the community (for our future and because relationship with children <br/>
brings us so much of our own learning and example). The website I&#39;ve <br/>
created goes into these concepts more, I encourage anyone curious to <br/>
check it out (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.teachingdrum.org/childrensculture.htm)">http://www.teachingdrum.org/childrensculture.htm)</a>, or <br/>
