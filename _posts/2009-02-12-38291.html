<div id="ygrps-yiv-1799566785">Just to preface this question, we began unschooling (radically) in <br/>
October 2008 and have found it to be amazing and we love living this <br/>
lifestyle.  That being said, I decided to read a book that I&#39;ve <br/>
always heard about: Better Late than Early by Raymond and Dorothy <br/>
Moore.  I&#39;m sure most, if not all, of you know this book :)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, as I&#39;m reading this book, I&#39;m enjoying it because it all <br/>
makes sense.  And then, while reading about visual development in <br/>
children and doing &quot;close work&quot; and how this can have an negative <br/>
impact on their ability to suceed in later years (meaning that all <br/>
the reading, close up busy work, focusing on blackboards, etc is not <br/>
healthy for the developing eyes in the early years (schooling) until <br/>
the child has developed maturity in developmental, emotional, <br/>
physical ways) they mention that tv watching in the early years is <br/>
also considered &quot;close work&quot; and has been shown to influence sight <br/>
related disorders in later years i.e. nearsightedness. This book was <br/>
written in 1974 and of course, since then, computers are now in the <br/>
mix. <br/>
<br/>
Now, since unschooling, we&#39;ve not been restricting TV watching and <br/>
have watched our 2 kids go from watching a lot of tv (as expected) to <br/>
watching more sporadically and also engaging in others things while <br/>
the tv is on in the background. They also go on the internet at times <br/>
too.  My issue and question is not related to how much <br/>
tv/computers...we are fine with that issue.  They claim that this <br/>
issue becomes less of a concern as the children develop maturity <br/>
usually after 8-10 years old. My kids are 2.5 yo and 7 yo. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just wondering if others have read anything about this as well?  <br/>
Do you have any concerns about this?  If anyone has read this book, <br/>
did you get hung up on this idea? I&#39;m not about to restrict my kids <br/>
tv watching and computer use.  However, reading this just really made <br/>
my heart sink.  <br/>
<br/>
Some ideas I have is that although they do watch tv and go on the <br/>
computer, they are making this choice...they are not being forced <br/>
into doing this &quot;close work&quot; like the kids at school are and that my <br/>
kids always have the option of focusing their eyes far away and <br/>
resting them if necessary.  Perhaps, naturally they become involved <br/>
in other activities to give their eyes a rest.  Also, they do a lot <br/>
of other things while the tv is on so they are often moving their <br/>
eyes around.  My son does get headaches on occassion that now I&#39;m <br/>
wondering if it might be related to this idea.<br/>
<br/>
However, at the same time, they also look at magazines, books, play <br/>
with toys, figures, legos, etc.  Wouldn&#39;t all this be <br/>
considered &quot;close work&quot; as well?  Especially in the winter, when we <br/>
stay indoors more, there is more &quot;close work&quot;.  The authors say that <br/>
optimally, looking more at distance things is best for kids up to 8-<br/>
10 years old.  However, really, how can a little one be more distance <br/>
oriented visually at this age most of the time?  Especially during <br/>
the winter months? Am I giving this paragraph more attention than it <br/>
needs?<br/>
<br/>
If anything, I think this will make me more mindful about offering <br/>
other activities throughout the day but I still need to hear what <br/>
others think about this because now, of course, I&#39;m thinking that all <br/>
this tv and computer watching is...gasp...bad ;) Just kidding...</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2049650196">There is so much written on the topic of media to scare parents. It&#39;s<br/>
hard to know how much to believe it, especially since the conventional<br/>
wisdom seems to change generation to generation. I grew up with TV. I<br/>
don&#39;t know how many hours I watched it but I don&#39;t remember it being<br/>
particularly restricted. Plus I was one of 3 kids so I imagine it was<br/>
on some even when I was not watching it. And I know I watched Sesame<br/>
Street and the like as a really little kid. FWIW, my eye sight is<br/>
perfect!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-945755383">There is confusion about the causes of myopia (nearsightedness) from what I can see. It is most likely genetic, although that does not mean that environmental factors won&#39;t come into play. It seems a minor thing to be concerned about. Eyes change fairly frequently. Pregnancy can change your eyesight. One thing you could do to lessen the effect might be to set up comfortable seats and pillows and cushions a bit further back from the tv, or get a bigger screen. In 1974 screen sizes would have been smaller and the reception would have been grainer than in modern television. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-711689535">thanks, your comments help!  I guess in &#39;74 the screens were pretty <br/>
small compared to today&#39;s screens and with the quality of the picture <br/>
today would seem to make it less stressful for the eyes.  <br/>
<br/>
i apprecaite your comments!  I&#39;m going to just continue (and increase) <br/>
the strewing around the house and outdoors and just relax about this <br/>
issue :) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2076125701">FWIW I watch hardly any TV growing up, Seriously, we didn&#39;t have one until I<br/>
was 12. I have nearsightedness in both eyes. My wonderful little sister<br/>
LOVED TV. She watched from dawn til dusk...perfect vision after age 9. Go<br/>
figure?<br/>
