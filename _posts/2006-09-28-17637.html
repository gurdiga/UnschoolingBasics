<div id="ygrps-yiv-226201472">Last night I had a young lady come to the cafe who was dressed in lots<br/>
of black with chains, and spikey hair, stark make up, somewhat<br/>
gothy-metal with these really cool black and day-glo green tennis<br/>
shoes.  She was wearing a t-shirt with the name of a band on it that<br/>
was ______ Butterfly.  It was not Iron Butterfly (I would have<br/>
recognized that one) nor was it Butterfly Effect (ditto).  We chatted<br/>
for a minute.  I asked her about the band and she said those ill-fated<br/>
words, &quot;You&#39;re too old to understand this kind of music.&quot;  I SO wanted<br/>
to say, &quot;Sweetie I was going to grunge and punk underground concerts<br/>
before your mama was out of diapers!&quot;  Instead I said, &quot;Try me.   What<br/>
kind of music do they play?&quot;  She hemmed and hawed and so I said, &quot;Is<br/>
it interstitial?&quot;  (Total blank stare)  &quot;Punk?&quot;  &quot;Not really&quot;<br/>
&quot;Grunge?&quot;  &quot;No not that either.&quot;  &quot;Heavy metal?&quot;  &quot;No&quot;  &quot;Techno?<br/>
Acid?  Head banging?  Pop?  Garage?&quot;  &quot;No. No. No. No. No.  It&#39;s hard<br/>
to define.&quot; &quot;Oh, so interstitial.&quot;  (another blank stare.)   So I told<br/>
her that I would look them up and hear what they had.<br/>
<br/>
Well, now I am home and in front of the computer and can&#39;t remember<br/>
the first part of the name.  The logo was a butterfly with the name of<br/>
the band over the it and red &quot;splattery blood/paint&quot; across it.  Does<br/>
this ring a bell with anyone?  I figured this would be a good group to<br/>
ask as we have children that are all over the spectrum as far as music<br/>
tastes go.<br/>

I found &quot;Black Eye Butterfly&quot;, &quot;Chasing Butterfly&quot; and &quot;Down with the <br/>
Butterfly&quot; with a quick google search - ?<br/>
