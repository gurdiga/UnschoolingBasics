GOOD! His sense of self is intact....good for him.<br/>
Listen to him.<br/>
Any gain that could be made by visiting a factory at this point, <br/>
will be overshadowed by damage to your relationship. The <br/>
relationship between you and your son should be the concern, not <br/>
some inconveniences that will happen over cancelling.<br/>
He doesn&#39;t want to go. So don&#39;t.<br/>
It&#39;s not like it&#39;s some once-in-a-lifetime opportunity...he&#39;s FOUR.<br/>
<br/>
Try to remember that this very little four year old will soon be <br/>
fourteen. He&#39;ll be exploring the world and seeing factories all the <br/>
time if he wants....don&#39;t worry.<br/>
I think keeping his sense of self intact is more important than any <br/>
potential for learning right now.<br/>
<br/>
Trust him. He&#39;ll trust you more. If you go against his desires and <br/>
try to force your will upon him, that will be detrimental to the <br/>
learning/unschooling process.<br/>
It&#39;s just a factory. There will be more.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-735740442">Thanks to everyone who has responded so far.  It has helped me to<br/>
lighten up about it which is already apparent in Scotty&#39;s response to<br/>
the whole issue.  I think part of his reaction was that I was worried<br/>
that he would balk at the hair net thing and he was picking up on my<br/>
worry.  <br/>
 <br/>
With 1.5 hours to go before we are scheduled to be there, his current<br/>
feeling is that he wants to give it a try, and that the hair net might<br/>
not be so bad.  We are not talking about it unless he mentions it. <br/>

It&#39;s definitely intact and fierce.  He is the kind of kid who flat out<br/>
refuses to participate in group activities where all the kids have to<br/>
line up and follow instructions (so school would be a nightmare-thank<br/>
goodness unschooling is an option).  My friend commented one time<br/>
&quot;there&#39;s a kid who does things on his own terms.&quot;  I respect and admire<br/>
this in him, which is why this morning&#39;s issue was frustrating me.  I<br/>
don&#39;t want to discount his feelings or break his will, yet I *know* that<br/>
he would absolutely love seeing that place.    <br/>
 <br/>
I will try a little bit of Pam&#39;s advice about taking small steps (thanks<br/>
Pam!), and if he still refuses I will not force or coerce him.  Thanks<br/>
also to everyone who said I should not take him against his will.  I<br/>
knew this was the answer in my heart, but it helped me to hear it from<br/>
you so I could let go of my expectations more easily.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ll let you know how it went :-)<br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
P.S.  I just talked with the lady who is giving the tour and explained<br/>
the situation and she was very understanding.  <br/>

<br/>
It was AWESOME!!!!!  Here&#39;s what happened:  he was watching Dragon Tales<br/>
and I told him that at the halfway point (thank goodness those PBS shows<br/>
have halfway points) it would be time to go.  I basically said we were<br/>
going to the post office and the paper factory, with the emphasis on the<br/>
post office.  He was mad when I turned off the TV, but only for a<br/>
minute.  I got him out the door by suggesting he pee outside, which he<br/>
loves to do.  I then got him in the car by suggesting that he could put<br/>
the letters in the mailbox at the P.O., which he also loves to do.<br/>
After the P.O. he asked where we were going and I said nonchalantly &quot;to<br/>
the paper factory&quot;.  He kind of half-heartedly said he wanted to go home<br/>
and see Daddy but soon started chatting about the scenery (we drive over<br/>
the Rio Grande to get there).  Moments later we were there-it&#39;s a really<br/>
familiar building to him because we drive past it all the time.  I kept<br/>
saying there&#39;s the factory and he started to get really excited.  We<br/>
went through the guard gate and I said &quot;I&#39;ll bet Mr. Rogers went through<br/>
a guard gate when he went to the plate factory&quot; and Scotty said &quot;No<br/>
Mommy, he didn&#39;t go to the factory, he watched a video about it&quot; :-p <br/>
 <br/>
            We got some visitor&#39;s badges and he got to hold his.  He was<br/>
still totally excited.  Then we parked and he said &quot;OK  let&#39;s put my<br/>
hair net on!&quot;  and I stupidly said &quot;we don&#39;t have to put it on yet-we&#39;ll<br/>
wait until the lady who&#39;s giving us the tour says we have to.  We&#39;re<br/>
going to meet a nice lady named Jolene.&quot;  Well that was not the right<br/>
thing to say.  He then started to say he didn&#39;t want to go any more (he<br/>
is apprehensive of meeting new people).  I applied the advice that Pam<br/>
had given and suggested that we just see the inside of the lobby.  He<br/>
was kind of whining about it but got distracted by the beautiful purple<br/>
prickly pear cactus at the entrance.  We went inside, waited about 60<br/>
seconds for Jolene, and luckily he took to her pretty well so the rest<br/>
was fine!  And boy oh boy did he love those machines.  He was grinning<br/>
from ear to ear, pointing at everything, jumping up and down from<br/>
excitement.  The lady there told us that he was the first little kid<br/>
that she knew of who had toured the factory.  We stayed about 40 minutes<br/>
and he got some samples and was talking about it nonstop afterwards.  He<br/>
said that the hair net was fine and that the machines weren&#39;t so loud<br/>
after all.<br/>
 <br/>
Thank you, thank you all for your support.  Taking the pressure off of<br/>
both of us helped a whole lot.  <br/>
Oh, and if you are curious, here&#39;s where we went:<br/>
