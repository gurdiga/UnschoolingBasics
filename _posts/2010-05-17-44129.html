<div id="ygrps-yiv-234519645">As the original poster I have been seriously considering this.  I must admit that a good number of you seem to engage in a certain lifestyle tdhat I could never embrace.  Not because of unschooling but because of the allow your child to do anything they want issue.  At the time that I joined this list I also joined another lust on unschooling and I must admit that I could unschool the way they do But doubt I could ever do it the way you all seem to.  Our views on life in general seem so far removed ed from each other.  That being said with the exception of the computer discussion I have very much enjoyed hearing everyone s answers to my questions and have learned quite a bit.<br/>

&gt;I think we have missed an important question from the original post (below) in the &quot;what would you do with $1000&quot; thread.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The poster asked if they should switch to unschooling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m thinking the answer is no. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So much of the back and forth in this thread has brought out life choices that I just don&#39;t think are compatible with unschooling. Unschooling is not for everyone and there&#39;s no sense trying to force it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Maybe let that idea go and get on with homeschooling with some new resources.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Nance<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My exhusband very much values education and is more then willing to pay for it<br/>
&gt;to see that they get the best education. I have full custody and complete<br/>
&gt;control of what school curriculum to buy/use. So should we switch to unschooling<br/>
&gt;what things would you buy for unschooling? We usually buy a pricey curriculum<br/>
&gt;and supplements. So what items or? Would you suggest buying in place of what we<br/>
&gt;have been buying curriculum?<br/>

Unschooling is very hands on. It&#39;s a partnership. We help them find  <br/>
safe, respectful, reasonable ways to accomplish what they&#39;&#39;re  <br/>
interested in.<br/>
<br/>
The conventional fear is that children will choose dangerous things.  <br/>
That fear makes sense. Conventionally parented often kids do. When  <br/>
kids really want something and parents say no, the kids will often  <br/>
find a way around the parents. But without adult help, the results can  <br/>
be disastrous. When parents are experienced as barriers,<br/>
<br/>
The reality -- what unschoolers actually experience -- is that kids --  <br/>
all humans really -- want to explore their boundaries to find out more  <br/>
about themselves, what they like and what they dislike and why. When a  <br/>
parent is there working or helping them work out ways to make an  <br/>
interest happen, the child knows the parent is there to help and they  <br/>
experience the process of taking care of the big picture rather than  <br/>
just focusing on the goal.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I consider a child with unsupervised internet access to be a very  <br/>
&gt; dangerous thing no matter what kind of filters you have in place.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s the standard fear. What exactly do you fear will happen?<br/>
<br/>
I know one standard fear is of internet predators. What parents don&#39;t  <br/>
realize is that predators don&#39;t prey on kids. They prey on *needy*  <br/>
kids. When parents say no, parents hope that puts an end to the  <br/>
desire. But it just creates a need the parent says they won&#39;t help  <br/>
with. While one no or even a dozen nos doesn&#39;t create a needy kid --  <br/>
though it depends on personality! -- if the child is building a  <br/>
feeling that mom and dad won&#39;t help, that mom and dad care more about  <br/>
what they want for the child than the child wants, he becomes a target  <br/>
for a predator. The parents *think* the nos are protecting the child  <br/>
but they&#39;re really cutting the child off. If someone offers  <br/>
understanding when the child doesn&#39;t feel the parent does, the child  <br/>
is going to turn to the one who seems to understand.<br/>
<br/>
It takes a lot of damage to a relationship for a child to trust a  <br/>
stranger over a parent, but conventional parenting is rife with  <br/>
practices that whittle away at relationships. So much so that people  <br/>
are certain that teen surliness and rebellion are biological. They  <br/>
aren&#39;t. It comes from damaged relationships. The teen is absolutely  <br/>
certain the parent cares more about the parents&#39; agenda for the teen  <br/>
than they do about who the teen is. By that point, because the parents  <br/>
has only helped with the ideas the parent think are worthy and  <br/>
dismissed the ideas the child thinks are worthy, the teen often does  <br/>
want to fight against the control just to fight the control and do  <br/>
dangerous things and want unreasonable things.<br/>
<br/>
When the relationship is put first as with radical unschooling, by the  <br/>
time the kids are teens, when a parent says &quot;Not a good idea&quot; the teen  <br/>
knows the parent *is* interested in helping and they really do mean  <br/>
this is problem that needs some serious thought to work around.<br/>
<br/>
By the time a conventionally parented kid is a teen &quot;Not a good idea,&quot;  <br/>
sounds like &quot;No,&quot; &quot;Where is your head?&quot; &quot;How could you possibly think  <br/>
that&#39;s a good idea?&quot; and all the other barriers the parent has spent  <br/>
14-16 years erecting.<br/>
<br/>
Another fear is pornography. A typical aspect of that fear is that  <br/>
kids will see it unexpectedly and be traumatized. That&#39;s what &quot;Safe  <br/>
Search&quot; is for on Google. Part of unschooling is helping kids find  <br/>
what they want *and* avoid what they aren&#39;t interested in. They *want*  <br/>
the junk they don&#39;t care about filtered out. Just as I don&#39;t want my  <br/>
husband running ideas past me that he knows don&#39;t interest me. Where  <br/>
filtering tears at a relationship is when the parent bases the  <br/>
filtering on what the parent wants the child to see rather on what the  <br/>
child wants to see. If for some reason my husband objected to fantasy  <br/>
movies, I&#39;d really resent if he were putting effort into keeping them  <br/>
from my sight.<br/>
<br/>
The argument is that kids are different and don&#39;t know enough about  <br/>
the world to make good choices. But kids aren&#39;t aliens. They will  <br/>
react with the same resentment and anger when someone is being a  <br/>
barrier between them and something that intrigues them as an adult  <br/>
would. What we do is help them safely explore it. Sometimes that  <br/>
exploration may be us giving them some more information so they can  <br/>
make a more informed decision (like a movie with a cat on the cover is  <br/>
a horror film rather than an animal film. We can learn their tastes to  <br/>
help them avoid what they don&#39;t want and find what they do want.)<br/>
<br/>
That said, I turned Safe Search off long ago. My daughter knew how to  <br/>
turn it back on but chose not to. She has seen porn pop up on Google  <br/>
Image search, but just as she flipped past channels as a kid that  <br/>
weren&#39;t showing something she was interested in, she skips past those  <br/>
too. (She&#39;s 18, BTW.)<br/>

<br/>
One example of this that happened last night. I come downstairs in the eveing to find my husband<br/>
Brian and my son MD ( he will be 8 in the end of June) wacthing a movie on TV.<br/>
I asked what movie was and they could not tell me the name but that it<br/>
was pretty cool. I sat down and in less than 2 minutes I realize it was Bridge to Terabithia.<br/>
It is a kids movie and up to a point it is really cute but them the girl gets killed in an accident and it <br/>
is pretty sad that even I cried when I saw it.<br/>
Knowing how my son is I knew he would have been very sad watching it and it was at the <br/>
part right before the boy comes home to find out his friend has died.<br/>
I told them what was going to happen and I asked MD if he wanted to see it or change the channel.<br/>
He decided to change the channel. <br/>
Up to the point the movie was cute and fun and I knew he would have been sad so I let him know.<br/>
I am sure he appreciated that I did. He is thankful that I am there to help him not see something<br/>
he does not want to.<br/>
It was his choice and he decided not to continue to wacth. I would have been OK if he wanted to.<br/>
Maybe a month from now he will feel ready to.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1010352928">***I consider a child with unsupervised internet access to be a very <br/>

<br/>
If you mean internet predators, not every child is at risk.  The grooming tricks of predators work on kids who are so desperate for love, approval, acceptance, understanding that they&#39;ll take what they can get from *anyone*, even a stranger, because they don&#39;t have, and probably haven&#39;t had that at home, ever.   Those same grooming tricks seem creepy and suspicious to emotionally healthy kids.   <br/>
<br/>
If you mean pornography, it&#39;s a common belief that every kid wants to see the weirdest of the weird stuff, but that&#39;s just not true.  Kid&#39;s who have healthy relationships with parents and who can ask questions and get truthful answers don&#39;t have the same interest as kids whose access to information about sex has been restricted.   When parents are normal about sex and sex information, kids are normal.    Sexual weirdness doesn&#39;t start with internet pornography.  It&#39;s starts with parental attitudes about sex. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you think kids should have no exposure to information or ideas about sex that the parent doesn&#39;t provide.  A parent is not likely to be a child&#39;s only source of information about sex even if a family doesn&#39;t have a computer.  I did not grow up with a computer or cable TV,  but I had four older siblings and they had friends.  My mother told me nothing about sex, but I knew plenty!&lt;g&gt;    It&#39;s normal and healthy to be curious about sex.  Sex will be part of a healthy life for many years.   Emotionally healthy people aren&#39;t warped by seeing disturbing images.  They may be shocked, or grossed out, but they&#39;re not warped for life.<br/>
<br/>
We have not had parental controls or filters on our computers.  Our son has had unsupervised internet access for years.  I know he&#39;s seen pornography.  He&#39;s even shown me or told me about some of the more amusing things he&#39;s come across.   He&#39;s eighteen.   He&#39;s never been in danger because of the internet and he&#39;s (relatively) normal.&lt;g.&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1556319931">Megan is 8, she&#39;ll be 9 at the beginning of August.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s always had access to a computer.  When she was smaller, we&#39;d sit and<br/>
play Playhouse Disney together (we still miss Clay! :-)  When she was older<br/>
we bought Jumpstart games (they are one of the few younger kid games that<br/>
aren&#39;t so educational they are dull). She&#39;s since graduated to Zoo Tycoon<br/>
and similar games.<br/>
<br/>
She also plays Webkinz (not so much anymore).  She loves Wolfquest and she&#39;s<br/>
starting to explore New Moon Girls.  She&#39;s played some other online games.<br/>
Most of what she plays have &quot;safe chat&quot; - varying in strength from<br/>
pre-selected phrases to not being able to use some words. But there are some<br/>
games that have no filters at all.<br/>
<br/>
I try to sit with her when she plays, but sometimes I need to take care of<br/>
my youngest or deal with the dog or whatever. Megan has logged out of a game<br/>
if people were saying things she didn&#39;t like (or if it was just boring).<br/>
She&#39;s not desperate for someone to be interested in her and talk to her.<br/>

One night, she was playing Wolfquest and I was keeping her company.  She<br/>
mentioned that the kids were talking about being out of school the next<br/>
day.  I mentioned that they didn&#39;t go to my niece&#39;s school because I knew<br/>
she had school the next day.  In the next fifteen minutes or so, several<br/>
kids shared enough info that we were able to find their city & school and<br/>
they also mentioned what grades they were in & named their teachers. It was<br/>
an interesting exploration about how easy it can be to learn about people<br/>
and how little bits of info can add up.<br/>
<br/>
I supposed I could have taken the info and scared the crap out of her with<br/>
it & done the whole &quot;big scary internet&quot; thing.  Instead, we talked about it<br/>
and it became a real experience for her - not just something  that caused a<br/>
&quot;no, don&#39;t do this&quot; reaction.<br/>

<br/>
All of them? Even the 11yo? That&#39;s a restriction with the potential for causing conflict, depending on how mature she is. At 11, plenty of girls are reading romance novels - I guarantee they&#39;re not PG!<br/>
<br/>
My kids are 8yrs apart - there&#39;s a looooot of development that happens across those years, lots of times when one is interested in something the other finds dull, or grotesque, or scary. What has helped the most has been making sure they both feel empowered to say &quot;No!&quot; If one person doesn&#39;t want to see or hear or do something, its time to re-think. How can we make this work better for everyone?<br/>
<br/>
Little kids don&#39;t want to see &quot;adult content&quot; unless its something that&#39;s been treated as a kind of special secret (or its the only way to spend time with parents, watching the news for example). They don&#39;t want to see sex - they aren&#39;t traumitized, just baffled and bored. Its not interesting to them. They may or may not fine &quot;violence&quot; interesting - or scary for that matter. That&#39;s something that varies a lot. Some kids like animated fights but not live action. Some are fine with any kind of fighting. Some are okay with physical fight scenes if the music isn&#39;t scary (so you can turn off the volume or skip  that scene or watch with commmentary turned on). Some are fine with physical violence but hate &quot;drama&quot; - emotional violence. Mo hates any scenes that show adults yelling at children, but doesn&#39;t mind mayhem and gore. <br/>
<br/>
If *you* don&#39;t want to see certain things, be clear about that - be clear about your boundaries!(but consider stretching them if your kids love something outside your comfort zone). If violence in movies and shows bothers you, say so (but please don&#39;t imply that what you&#39;re seeing on the screen is &quot;real&quot; - that&#39;s confusing fantasy and reality and kids don&#39;t need adults to do that). If sexual imagery bothers you, talk about that. What bothers you? That its unrealistic? That its scary? That it brings up personal issues? Your kids may agree, or they may have a different perspective (they may just find it dull, though, the little ones anyway).<br/>
<br/>
But like it or not, with an 11yo, you&#39;re on the verge of dealing with issues of sexuality. *She* may be dealing with issues of sexuality already. Like I said, plenty of girls are reading romances to push their &quot;sex ed&quot; past periods and babies. Here are a few links with more information/thoughts in that department:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1445192159">No one has said, &quot;Give your kid a computer with Internet access and  <br/>
ignore them.&quot; be invovled with your children. Do Internet searches  <br/>
*with* them. Sit with them while they navigate the world wide web!  <br/>
It&#39;s delightful. Or for the older ones be nearby ready to help, answer  <br/>
questions, guide them towards the information they want. It&#39;s all  <br/>
about making their world BIGGER! :-)<br/>
<br/>
I have a dd13, ds7 and dd2.5. The oldest has her own computer w  <br/>
Internet access and other software. She&#39;s a writer. She knows how to  <br/>
safely navigate the web and I trust her completely. The younger two  <br/>
share a computer with each other. Ds7 can do pretty much whatever he  <br/>
wants. That means follow his interests which at this point include  <br/>
legos, roblox, webkinz, pbskids, nickelodeon and nerf guns. I am  <br/>
usually withing feet of him when he&#39;s online. I&#39;m there so that he can  <br/>
show me cool stuff or ask for help. Dd2.5 isn&#39;t reading :-) yet and  <br/>
needs quite a bit of help exploring online. I&#39;m right there with her.  <br/>
Usually she&#39;s on my lap.<br/>
<br/>
About trust and kids being safe...<br/>
Dd13 was telling me about a site she discovered, omegal.com. It&#39;s for  <br/>
chatting anonomously with random people. My first reaction was -OMG  <br/>
this is scary! Predators, my baby...!- so I took a deep breath and  <br/>
asked her more about it. She said it&#39;s really fun and she&#39;s had some  <br/>
great conversations. After listening a bit and asking a few more  <br/>
questions,  I told her how when she first told me about it is sounded  <br/>
sketchy (I said it without drama). She said yeah there were sketchy  <br/>
people but she just disconnected when people were weird. Mostly people  <br/>
were cool and interesting. she has no interest in sketchy weirdos.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t need to protect her (or even ds7) because I&#39;ve given then the  <br/>
space to retain their own integrity. They listen to these alarms and  <br/>
look at these red flags and walk away. They not been forced to repress  <br/>
them. They protect themselves. They listen to their own sound inner  <br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; Not because of unschooling but because of the allow your child to  <br/>
&gt; do<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; anything they want issue.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;It&#39;s more clearly expressed as helping them do what they want.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Unschooling is very hands on. It&#39;s a partnership. We help them find<br/>
&gt; &gt;safe, respectful, reasonable ways to accomplish what they&#39;&#39;re<br/>
&gt; &gt;interested in.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;The conventional fear is that children will choose dangerous things.<br/>
&gt; &gt;That fear makes sense. Conventionally parented often kids do. When<br/>
&gt; &gt;kids really want something and parents say no, the kids will often<br/>
&gt; &gt;find a way around the parents. But without adult help, the results  <br/>
&gt; can<br/>
&gt; &gt;be disastrous. When parents are experienced as barriers,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;The reality -- what unschoolers actually experience -- is that kids  <br/>
&gt; --<br/>
&gt; &gt;all humans really -- want to explore their boundaries to find out  <br/>
&gt; more<br/>
&gt; &gt;about themselves, what they like and what they dislike and why.  <br/>
&gt; When a<br/>
&gt; &gt;parent is there working or helping them work out ways to make an<br/>
&gt; &gt;interest happen, the child knows the parent is there to help and they<br/>
&gt; &gt;experience the process of taking care of the big picture rather than<br/>
&gt; &gt;just focusing on the goal.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; I consider a child with unsupervised internet access to be a very<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; dangerous thing no matter what kind of filters you have in place.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;That&#39;s the standard fear. What exactly do you fear will happen?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I know one standard fear is of internet predators. What parents don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;realize is that predators don&#39;t prey on kids. They prey on *needy*<br/>
&gt; &gt;kids. When parents say no, parents hope that puts an end to the<br/>
&gt; &gt;desire. But it just creates a need the parent says they won&#39;t help<br/>
&gt; &gt;with. While one no or even a dozen nos doesn&#39;t create a needy kid --<br/>
&gt; &gt;though it depends on personality! -- if the child is building a<br/>
&gt; &gt;feeling that mom and dad won&#39;t help, that mom and dad care more about<br/>
&gt; &gt;what they want for the child than the child wants, he becomes a  <br/>
&gt; target<br/>
&gt; &gt;for a predator. The parents *think* the nos are protecting the child<br/>
&gt; &gt;but they&#39;re really cutting the child off. If someone offers<br/>
&gt; &gt;understanding when the child doesn&#39;t feel the parent does, the child<br/>
&gt; &gt;is going to turn to the one who seems to understand.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;It takes a lot of damage to a relationship for a child to trust a<br/>
&gt; &gt;stranger over a parent, but conventional parenting is rife with<br/>
&gt; &gt;practices that whittle away at relationships. So much so that people<br/>
&gt; &gt;are certain that teen surliness and rebellion are biological. They<br/>
&gt; &gt;aren&#39;t. It comes from damaged relationships. The teen is absolutely<br/>
&gt; &gt;certain the parent cares more about the parents&#39; agenda for the teen<br/>
&gt; &gt;than they do about who the teen is. By that point, because the  <br/>
&gt; parents<br/>
&gt; &gt;has only helped with the ideas the parent think are worthy and<br/>
&gt; &gt;dismissed the ideas the child thinks are worthy, the teen often does<br/>
&gt; &gt;want to fight against the control just to fight the control and do<br/>
&gt; &gt;dangerous things and want unreasonable things.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;When the relationship is put first as with radical unschooling, by  <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt;time the kids are teens, when a parent says &quot;Not a good idea&quot; the  <br/>
&gt; teen<br/>
&gt; &gt;knows the parent *is* interested in helping and they really do mean<br/>
&gt; &gt;this is problem that needs some serious thought to work around.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;By the time a conventionally parented kid is a teen &quot;Not a good  <br/>
&gt; idea,&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;sounds like &quot;No,&quot; &quot;Where is your head?&quot; &quot;How could you possibly think<br/>
&gt; &gt;that&#39;s a good idea?&quot; and all the other barriers the parent has spent<br/>
&gt; &gt;14-16 years erecting.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Another fear is pornography. A typical aspect of that fear is that<br/>
&gt; &gt;kids will see it unexpectedly and be traumatized. That&#39;s what &quot;Safe<br/>
&gt; &gt;Search&quot; is for on Google. Part of unschooling is helping kids find<br/>
&gt; &gt;what they want *and* avoid what they aren&#39;t interested in. They  <br/>
&gt; *want*<br/>
&gt; &gt;the junk they don&#39;t care about filtered out. Just as I don&#39;t want my<br/>
&gt; &gt;husband running ideas past me that he knows don&#39;t interest me. Where<br/>
&gt; &gt;filtering tears at a relationship is when the parent bases the<br/>
&gt; &gt;filtering on what the parent wants the child to see rather on what  <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt;child wants to see. If for some reason my husband objected to fantasy<br/>
&gt; &gt;movies, I&#39;d really resent if he were putting effort into keeping them<br/>
&gt; &gt;from my sight.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;The argument is that kids are different and don&#39;t know enough about<br/>
&gt; &gt;the world to make good choices. But kids aren&#39;t aliens. They will<br/>
&gt; &gt;react with the same resentment and anger when someone is being a<br/>
&gt; &gt;barrier between them and something that intrigues them as an adult<br/>
&gt; &gt;would. What we do is help them safely explore it. Sometimes that<br/>
&gt; &gt;exploration may be us giving them some more information so they can<br/>
&gt; &gt;make a more informed decision (like a movie with a cat on the cover  <br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; &gt;a horror film rather than an animal film. We can learn their tastes  <br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt;help them avoid what they don&#39;t want and find what they do want.)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;That said, I turned Safe Search off long ago. My daughter knew how to<br/>
&gt; &gt;turn it back on but chose not to. She has seen porn pop up on Google<br/>
&gt; &gt;Image search, but just as she flipped past channels as a kid that<br/>
&gt; &gt;weren&#39;t showing something she was interested in, she skips past those<br/>
&gt; &gt;too. (She&#39;s 18, BTW.)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How do you accomplish that? <br/>
<br/>
I felt the same way when my oldest was younger. I was very afraid of her seeing and hearing certain things. The more we went out and did stuff, the more I realized that it is almost impossible to keep everything PG. I will never forget when my oldest was 3 or 4 and saw a picture of a half naked lady on a billboard while we were driving down the road. I was horrified because she actually asked me about it. I think it was an ad for a gentleman&#39;s club. In my mind, that was not appropriate and there was no way to avoid that billboard. I also remember standing in line at the grocery store with my oldest daughter. The stuff on the shelves by the check out is pretty racy. The conversations of some of the people around us were less than stellar. I was so keenly aware of how R rated our world was that I kind of freaked out. It led me to do some serious thinking (and rethinking). I could freak out and try to limit my daughter (now daughters) or I could share my thoughts with them and empower them to think for themselves. It was interesting to note that the things that I noticed and was trying not to freak about were things that my daughter didn&#39;t even notice. The only reason that my daughter noticed the billboard for the gentleman&#39;s club was because of the pretty bra that the lady was wearing on her mommy drinks. : -) For my daughter, there was nothing sexual about the image at all. I was the one that filtered it as sexual and freaked out. <br/>
<br/>
There have been several other instances where my children were exposed to things that I wasn&#39;t happy about. When my oldest was younger, she was playing with an older cousin. When she got home, I discovered that she watched him play Grand Theft Auto. That was way before I knew anything about unschooling so I muddled through. I had to make a choice. Do I tell my daughter that she can&#39;t hang out with her favorite cousin or do I talk to my nephew or what? For a while, I asked my nephew if he could not play it around my daughter. He tried not to play it but it was a really big inconvenience for him and it really irritated my daughter. I found out that they were sneaking around and playing it anyway. That was a long time ago. Now, I don&#39;t really care if they play it. I have talked to my daughter about why it bothers me and she has told me that she knows it is all fake. It is so fake that she finds it funny. This is from a kid that freaks out over real violence. We can&#39;t even raise our voices without her having a strong reaction. <br/>
<br/>
Whenever I am watching a show that has anything remotely romantic or kissy in it, my girls will say something. My oldest will say, &quot;Mom, that really offends me. Would you please change the channel?&quot; My daughters&#39; filter for what she considers inappropriate is way stricter than my filter.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2037933791">Back when DS was about 5 or 6, a friend (L) asked DH to sit for a bust.<br/>
She&#39;s a sculptress and she loved the different textures in his hair and<br/>
beard (his hair is almost baby fine and was shoulder length at the time,<br/>
his beard is crinklier and was mid chest length then). He&#39;s got a solid<br/>
Germanic head, wonderful for sculpting. They arranged for the sitting on<br/>
a Monday afternoon. Side note: DH is the at home parent with DS while I<br/>
work fulltime. So, that means that DS was going to be with DH during the<br/>
sitting at her studio. As usual, we&#39;d pack him a bag with his Nintendo<br/>
DS, paper and markers to draw, water bottle, snacks, etc. to make him<br/>
comfortable for that time. The day before the sitting, L said she needed<br/>
to talk to me. Okay, what&#39;s up? She was concerned because she had lots<br/>
of sketches of nudes hanging in her studio and wanted to make sure it<br/>
was okay that DS would be there. I just chuckled and said I&#39;ll bet he<br/>
looks around, asks why there are all the naked butts, and then ignores<br/>
them. Sure enough, they got there, he looked around, asked why there<br/>
were all these naked butt people pictures. L explained that drawing<br/>
naked people helps her see and learn about how muscles and bones work<br/>
when people move so that she can make better sculptures. He said Oh Okay<br/>
and grabbed his Nintendo DS and spent most of the rest of the time<br/>
playing and watching her work. It&#39;s never been a big deal - he&#39;s seen me<br/>
naked when he was younger, he&#39;s seen DH naked. Over the last year or<br/>
two, for a few reasons, he has chosen privacy for himself and prefers<br/>
not to see other people naked. So we honor that. It&#39;s no big deal.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2087340709"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; But I must admit that at this point I do wonder why some would go the<br/>

<br/>
The simplest answer is that if you come to trust that your kids can and<br/>
will learn in their own way, their own time, following their own<br/>
interests, with your help to facilitate access to things (driving to the<br/>
library, for example) why would you not trust that they can learn about<br/>
food, sleep, hygiene, Internet safety, interpersonal relationships and<br/>
so on the same way - in their time, their way, with you alongside as a<br/>
partner to help them get access to that which they want access to. It&#39;s<br/>
coming to the realization that once you start questioning the standard<br/>
&quot;educational&quot; stuff, everything else is open to question too. If going<br/>
to school is not &quot;necessary&quot;, then is being &quot;at grade level&quot; necessary?<br/>
If getting up in the morning for school isn&#39;t needed, are<br/>
parent-established &#39;bedtimes&#39; needed? And on it goes. It&#39;s about living<br/>
in partnership with our kids the same way we live in partnership with<br/>
our adult partner in the household. <br/>

14 we started life drawing with live nudes. Our teachers said there  <br/>
was never any issues because it was treated like there wasn&#39;t any issue.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-541994226">***But I must admit that at this point I do wonder why some would go the radical route.***<br/>
<br/>
Radical means going to the root, to the origin.   As that pertains to learning, I saw my young child trying to do the same things the big people around him were doing and I considered that all of learning could be like that - finding a thing interesting or useful and trying to do it.    <br/>
<br/>
Toddler Dylan would help me fold clothes, help me pick up toys, help me wash dishes.  A profound moment for me was when I was wiping off the kitchen table and he went into the bathroom and got a wash cloth and started wiping things.  He first wiped the edge of the table.  He was too short to wipe the top - fourteen months old - he then wiped the floor a bit, wiped his toes, wiped the side of the washing machine, and wiped the dog.  I remember thinking then, maybe for the first time in my life, that learning was such a natural thing.  <br/>
<br/>
When I was little and helped my mom fold clothes she would always undo what I had done and fold it again.  The right way.  She sent a clear message that my help was wrong and not any kind of help if she had to do it all again anyway.  I stopped being willing to help. <br/>
<br/>
I decided not to do that to Dylan.  I wondered what it would be like for a person to be free to learn naturally, to have someone on his side, someone who cared more about his accomplishment and joy than about how the towels looked.   What if learning was in the desire, the attempt, the experimentation, the camaraderie, and not necessarily in the &quot;right&quot; outcome?  That was a big idea for me. <br/>
<br/>
I started reading about learning.  Learning about learning.&lt;g&gt;    I read John Holt and others, but probably Holt made the biggest impression, maybe his writing style appealed to me.   <br/>
<br/>
I started thinking about how other kinds of learning might happen the same way, how a person might learn to read by being around people who read and who read to him, by seeing lots of reading materials around, by using words and playing with words and sounds. <br/>
<br/>
When I had these kinds of ideas it wasn&#39;t a stretch to consider how a child might, with help from people who cared about his happiness and success, discover all of the things in life that would be interesting and useful to him.  <br/>
<br/>
It seems like an extreme idea in a world that views children as empty, shapeless, lacking judgment, lacking intelligence, lacking morality, until some adult fills them, molds them, puts the important stuff into them.     But it is not an extreme idea when you understand human learning and human nature.  <br/>
<br/>
When you hear the words &quot;radical unschooling&quot; consider it to mean going to the root of all learning.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; One example of this that happened last night. I come downstairs in the eveing to find my husband<br/>
&gt; Brian and my son MD ( he will be 8 in the end of June) wacthing a movie on TV.<br/>
&gt; I asked what movie was and they could not tell me the name but that it<br/>
&gt; was pretty cool. I sat down and in less than 2 minutes I realize it was Bridge to Terabithia.<br/>
&gt; It is a kids movie and up to a point it is really cute but them the girl gets killed in an accident and it <br/>
&gt; is pretty sad that even I cried when I saw it.<br/>
&gt; Knowing how my son is I knew he would have been very sad watching it and it was at the <br/>
&gt; part right before the boy comes home to find out his friend has died.<br/>
&gt; I told them what was going to happen and I asked MD if he wanted to see it or change the channel.<br/>
&gt; He decided to change the channel. <br/>
&gt; Up to the point the movie was cute and fun and I knew he would have been sad so I let him know.<br/>
&gt; I am sure he appreciated that I did. He is thankful that I am there to help him not see something<br/>
&gt; he does not want to.<br/>
&gt; It was his choice and he decided not to continue to wacth. I would have been OK if he wanted to.<br/>
&gt; Maybe a month from now he will feel ready to.<br/>

My children are very good about knowing what they can handle watching.  The other day my son Ben asked me what movie Jason is from ( I think he had seen a character on Roblox).  I told him it was from a scary movie called Nightmare on Elmstreet and he immediately stopped me from saying more and said, &quot;next time I ask about a character like that, just say it is from a scary movie, I dont want any more details&quot;.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1399828005">Not to be overly nitpicky, but Jason is from Friday the 13th. I can remember sitting in a movie theatre facing the wrong way in my seat at 16 or 17 going to see Friday the 13th part the somethingth. It was too scary for me. Simon and Linnaea are both very good at avoiding the things that they don&#39;t want to see, scary things, things on the graphic side of sexual. We&#39;ve had lots of interesting conversations because of things they&#39;ve stumbled across and then moved away from. I don&#39;t imagine they would even think themselves ready to sit in on a Friday the 13th movie for long enough to sit the wrong way in the seat. <br/>

<br/>
I wondered the same thing. When my 3 year old is on the computer, I have to get her where she needs to go. My 5 year old isn&#39;t actively reading yet so she relies on me to help her sort things out. I have put the games and sites that they like in the tool bar for them. My oldest will google stuff and go on youtube but she usually asks me about it first. I don&#39;t tell her that she has to. She went through a period of time where she was very fascinated with anatomy and physiology. We talked about how sometimes innocent searches can bring up stuff that is offensive. She was more interested in finding the science. She didn&#39;t want to take a chance on being offended or grossed out so we decided to use books instead. We found a copy of Gray&#39;s Anatomy for her to research stuff on anatomy and physiology. If she wants to research a topic that she isn&#39;t sure of, she will ask me about it first. Since we have a computer station with 2 computers, it is pretty common for me to be sitting next to her anyway. <br/>

One of my big aha moments was when we lived with my mother-in-law. We had pretty much always unschooled as far as curriculum was concerned. We had always been pretty lax on rules because I have always had a problem doing things that didn&#39;t make sense. &quot;Because I said so&quot; has always been a sore spot for me. When my family lived with my in-laws, I was reminded first hand how it feels to have everything scrutinized. We had to make our beds in the morning. We all had to eat at the table together even though it was not convenient and didn&#39;t make sense. We couldn&#39;t get up from the table without saying, &quot;May I please be excused.&quot; Towels had to be folded just so or my MIL would &quot;fix&quot; it. She would stand over my shoulder when I cooked. I am normally a good cook but when she stood over my shoulder saying stuff and scrutinizing my every move, I continually messed it up. When my husband got what he thought was his dream job, one of the first things his mother said was, &quot;Don&#39;t screw this up.&quot; We did not want to do that to our children. We had always leaned towards unschooling even before we knew it existed. When I discovered the radical unschooling boards, I was ecstatic because I found a way to NOT do to my children what my MIL did to me and my husband. I found a way to reconcile all of those bad feelings I had about all of the times that I was controlled or ignored as a kid. I saw radical unschooling as a way to heal myself and empower my kids so that they didn&#39;t have to put up with the stuff that I did as a kid. I didn&#39;t have a horrible childhood. It was actually pretty typical. The adults were in charge and you were supposed to go to school and get educated so that you could grow up and be a productive member of society. <br/>
<br/>
Another big thing for me was watching my nieces and nephews grow up. I watched their passions get sucked from them each year they were in school. When I ask them their opinion on something, they seem hesitant like they are trying to give the right answer. There is a spark that is missing. I see that my sisters are either controlling them or ignoring them. If the kids have a problem, the parents step in and take control and &quot;fix&quot; it. So, the kids learn to quit asking or put themselves aside. Really, there are a ton of reasons that the radical route is appealing to me.<br/>

<br/>
My 10 year old wanted to go down to the lake by herself . I told her I was concerned about her getting hurt on her bike and the phone not getting a signal for her to call me.

<br/>
I think as parents we want to protect our children from everything and find out we can&#39;t so we can keep trying to keep them from everything and have them fear calling us when there is serious trouble or empower them to make the best decisions possible and be right there for them when things don&#39;t go as planned. <br/>

As that pertains to learning, I saw my young child trying to do the same things the big people around him were doing and I considered that all of learning could be like that - finding a thing interesting or useful and trying to do it. . . . .  It seems like an extreme idea in a world that views children as empty, shapeless, lacking judgment, lacking intelligence, lacking morality, until some adult fills them, molds them, puts the important stuff into them. But it is not an extreme idea when you understand human learning and human nature. <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;One of my big aha moments was when we lived with my mother-in-law. We had pretty much always unschooled as far as curriculum was concerned. We had always been pretty lax on rules because I have always had a problem doing things that didn&#39;t make sense. &quot;Because I said so&quot; has always been a sore spot for me. When my family lived with my in-laws, I was reminded first hand how it feels to have everything scrutinized. We had to make our beds in the morning. We all had to eat at the table together even though it was not convenient and didn&#39;t make sense. We couldn&#39;t get up from the table without saying, &quot;May I please be excused.&quot; Towels had to be folded just so or my MIL would &quot;fix&quot; it. She would stand over my shoulder when I cooked. I am normally a good cook but when she stood over my shoulder saying stuff and scrutinizing my every move, I continually messed it up. When my husband got what he thought was his dream job, one of the first things his mother said<br/>
&gt; was, &quot;Don&#39;t screw this up.&quot; We did not want to do that to our children. We had always leaned towards unschooling even before we knew it existed. When I discovered the radical unschooling boards, I was ecstatic because I found a way to NOT do to my children what my MIL did to me and my husband. I found a way to reconcile all of those bad feelings I had about all of the times that I was controlled or ignored as a kid. I saw radical unschooling as a way to heal myself and empower my kids so that they didn&#39;t have to put up with the stuff that I did as a kid. I didn&#39;t have a horrible childhood. It was actually pretty typical. The adults were in charge and you were supposed to go to school and get educated so that you could grow up and be a productive member of society. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Another big thing for me was watching my nieces and nephews grow up. I watched their passions get sucked from them each year they were in school. When I ask them their opinion on something, they seem hesitant like they are trying to give the right answer. There is a spark that is missing. I see that my sisters are either controlling them or ignoring them. If the kids have a problem, the parents step in and take control and &quot;fix&quot; it. So, the kids learn to quit asking or put themselves aside. Really, there are a ton of reasons that the radical route is appealing to me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-339952953">&lt;&lt;The other day my son Ben asked me what movie Jason is from..I told him it<br/>
was from a scary movie called Nightmare on Elmstreet&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
LOL Jason is Friday the 13th.  Freddy Krueger is Nightmare on Elm Street.<br/>
And they are both pretty spooky - at least in their first 3 movies.<br/>
Everything after that became comical.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-120357003">Dakari is unphased by scary movies.  It just doesn&#39;t enter his mind to be<br/>
afraid.  I guess that&#39;s the great part about him being the shiny kid he is.<br/>
Safiya has gotten to the point where she enjoys being afraid as long as she<br/>
is controlling the object of her fear.  For instance, they watched Darkness<br/>
Falls some weeks back (about the evil tooth fairy), and Safiya would run out<br/>
of the room and peek around the corner when she heard &quot;the music&quot; that lets<br/>
you know something is about to happen.  The boys (including Khalid, 7, and<br/>
Khidar, 5) were not bothered at all by the movie.  For some days after the<br/>
four of them had a good laugh pretending to be scared of the tooth fairy and<br/>
describing various scenarios in which she would come and get them.  Now the<br/>
movie is old news.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Jabari and Safiya just sat through a horrible zombie movie on the SciFi<br/>
channel.  Safiya thought it was a joke.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I think they react this way to movies because we always watch the behind the<br/>
scenes of movies like Lord of The Rings and the like. We talk about the<br/>
makeup and special effects, and how they make things look scary.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
But we are big scifi, zombie, vampire people here.  So scary is all we talk<br/>
about J<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A year or so ago there was a &quot;Kill Bill&quot; marathon on some channel or other - both movies back to back and Ray wanted to watch them. Mo drifted into the room partway through the first movie and I was on the edge of my seat, ready to jump in with some quick problem solving if she found it upsetting. Instead she thought it very funny - she easily saw all the comic book and cartoon references I&#39;d totally missed and happily sat through both films, highly entertained. <br/>
