 </span></blockquote>At first I was going to say that I do think there are parents who might <br/>
claim to be unschooling, but are really not &#39;engaged&#39; with their kids - <br/>
don&#39;t really have the energy and interest to support their kids&#39; <br/>
learning by creating a rich and interesting life filled with <br/>
opportunities for varied experiences and exposure.<br/>
<br/>
But I can&#39;t really, quite honestly, think of anybody so like that that <br/>
I would call it an &quot;unschooling horror story.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Are there any bad things or downsides to being an adult who lives in a world<br/>
where she or he has choices and support in those choices?<br/>
<br/>
The downsides of unschooling are that at first pass it sounds like &quot;Let the<br/>
kids alone and they&#39;ll learn everything they need.&quot; If someone takes that<br/>
definition and raises their kids like that it&#39;s not going to work.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling takes trust that kids are showing us what they need by their<br/>
behavior. THey are showing us not just in what they choose to do but in<br/>
their attitude. Someone can take that first sentence and years down the road<br/>
say &quot;Well, I let my kid watch TV for 3 years straight and he&#39;s miserable.&quot;<br/>
But that&#39;s because a parent was looking at the surface and not at the child.<br/>
They were taking what was said -- let them follow their interests -- as a<br/>
rule and applying it rather than understanding the principle of being a<br/>
child&#39;s partner. Unschooling is not a set of actions to apply that will<br/>
yield certain results. Unschooling requires a deep awareness of our children<br/>
and their needs. Unschooling requires involvement with them.<br/>
<br/>
When people first hear about unschooling it sounds too easy to be true :-)<br/>
And then if they keep looking and asking questions they realize it&#39;s not so<br/>
easy. There&#39;s real hard work invovled in examining and eliminating old<br/>
assumptions about how learning works. But then when someone truly gets<br/>
unschooling they realize how easy it really is :-)<br/>

 <br/>
No horror stories from people who understand the philosophy and who put it  <br/>
into action.<br/>
 <br/>
I know of a family that simply neglects the kids and call it unschooling.  It <br/>
isn&#39;t. <br/>
 <br/>
Bad things? In-laws and friends and strangers who are constantly  questioning <br/>
you on what you&#39;re doing. You can let them get to you, you can  ignore them, <br/>
or you can tell them to mind their own business. <br/>
 <br/>
Nosy neighbors? That&#39;s a neighbor problem, not an unschooling one. Tell  them <br/>
you are following the law. <br/>
