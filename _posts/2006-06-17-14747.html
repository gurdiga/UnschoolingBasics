<div id="ygrps-yiv-2038073903">Just a gentle reminder than the Live and Learn Unschooling Conference&#39;s <br/>
Early Bird deadline is approaching. It&#39;s only two weeks away---the end <br/>
of this month: June 30, 2006.<br/>
<br/>
 Funshop and scholarship requests are also due by the end of June.<br/>

  &quot;The hardest problem for the brain is not learning, but forgetting. No <br/>
matter how hard we try, we can&#39;t deliberately forget something we have <br/>
learned, and that is catastrophic if we learn that we can&#39;t learn.&quot; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-131182824">Shannon, payment is here. I&#39;ve been trying myself  to get the <br/>
registration to download. I couldn&#39;t. Asked my husband and teenager <br/>
&lt;g&gt;---also no luck. Even my web designer couldn&#39;t open it.<br/>
<br/>
If you could maybe cut and paste the registration into an e-mail and <br/>
then fill it out then?<br/>
<br/>
If nothing else, I can call you to get the information and fill it out <br/>
by hand! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Enough of this email stuff!  Give it to me for real!<br/>
