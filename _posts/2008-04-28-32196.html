<div id="ygrps-yiv-1944007333">I&#39;m the &quot;US-interested&quot; mom, of a 2 years and a half DD (dear<br/>
daughter), Delia<br/>
Not yet convinced, but rather interested in US, I would like to met<br/>
and conect with some of you, US people, living close to us. Please let<br/>
us know, if we can met, if we can do together some of the things you<br/>
do with your kids.<br/>
<br/>
Wish to here from you soon, Adana, mom to Delia<br/>
<br/>
P.S.I will add a presentation of mine that I sent to the group of moms<br/>
in Astoria:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Hi,<br/>
My name is Adriana (Adana), I&#39;m 33 and I have a daughter of 2 years<br/>
and 8 months.<br/>
I don&#39;t speak English well and I will not be able to write messages<br/>
like this without help from my friends. Thus, please don&#39;t be upset if<br/>
I am not able to answer too quickly.<br/>
I&#39;m looking for an English teacher, so if you know anyone who is good,<br/>
please recommend him/her to me.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know exactly what to tell you about us. We have been living<br/>
here for a year and a half and we will be staying for roughly another<br/>
year and a half after which we return to our native country, Romania.<br/>
<br/>
My most ardent preoccupation lately has been to look for activities<br/>
for my little girl. This is because I&#39;m trying to find new ways to<br/>
stimulate her, to entertain her and to give her the chance to discover<br/>
what is more interesting for her in this world. I&#39;ve selected so far<br/>
from what places like Steinway church, Children&#39;s Museum of The Arts,<br/>
Appleseeds, MoonSoup and others have to offer. For the time being I&#39;ve<br/>
decided to sign her up at MoonSoup and at Children&#39;s Museum of The Arts.<br/>
<br/>
However, what I&#39;m most interested in is to find that kind of<br/>
activities that could suit best the HomeSchooling or the UnSchooling<br/>
philosophy. I&#39;m curious if there are other mothers in this group who<br/>
practice homeschooling or are thinking of doing this and if they can<br/>
recommend some suitable activities that complement harmoniously the<br/>
way they raise their children and that fit Delia&#39;s age as well.<br/>
I&#39;d be very glad, in case they exist, if they allowed me to come among<br/>
them, to see what they do and how they do it. In what form this could<br/>
happen, it&#39;s not clear to me yet.<br/>
I think that for me it would be very difficult to practice either of<br/>
these two forms of free education at the moment because I was raised<br/>
myself in a classical manner, based on punishments and rewards, and I<br/>
cannot make out very clearly how things can be done differently.<br/>
I mean, I don&#39;t behave like this with Delia, or, more specifically, I<br/>
try to be careful and not to do it. But I really believe that children<br/>
are natively endowed with the learning ability and we just have to<br/>
expose them to information, just teach them to search and they will be<br/>
capable to do the rest. Hence, the activities that I&#39;m looking for now<br/>
are rather amusing, interesting and less centered on necessarily<br/>
obtaining some end products, or certain skills. I see them more as a<br/>
presentation of some interesting things, some of which the child will<br/>
feel tempted to do andâ¦ surprise, someone will be there to help her,<br/>
to guide her. And this comes above teaching her. Besides the arguments<br/>
brought by US and HS, I feel that at this stage in her life it is<br/>
important to have around her several key persons of diverse ages â&quot;as<br/>
diverse as possible- whom she could meet constantly and from whom she<br/>
could learn. Because here, we are more or less isolated.<br/>
<br/>
And since I opened the discussion on education, I would like to add<br/>
that I am now reading Alfie Kohn and Donald Winnicott with great pleasure.<br/>
<br/>
I will end here for the moment, I no longer want to torture my friend<br/>
who helps me with the translation. I hope I have let you know me a<br/>
little and I also<br/>
hope that I will be able to get to know you gradually and that my<br/>
English will allow me to do so as much as possible.<br/>
I think you will get to know Delia by justâ¦ seeing her in action. She<br/>
is wonderful and radiant and beautiful &#61514;.<br/>
Unfortunately I didn&#39;t manage to post pictures, I suppose they were<br/>
too large and I don&#39;t know exactly how to make them smaller.<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>
Adriana&quot;</div>
