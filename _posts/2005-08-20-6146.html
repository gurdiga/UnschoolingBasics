i do  have a question regrading music choices. dd is almost 11. she really <br/>
enjoys  hip-hop. understandablly, the music is fun to dance around to. it just <br/>
irrates  me to see the way hip-hop/rap cultures and its attitude towards women: <br/>
sex  objects. how have you (that&#39;s a plural you) dealt with this with your <br/>
young  daughters. <br/>
<br/>

******************<br/>
I have amazing conversations with my son, who is almost 16. He lives with  <br/>
his feminist lesbian moms, and he&#39;s a musician into heavy metal music. I&#39;ll  <br/>
listen to music he wants to share, we have long conversations about who has  <br/>
talent and who doesn&#39;t, etc. The other night he put on an MTV show called Metal  <br/>
Asylum with videos. We watched a couple, including one song with the disturbing <br/>
 title &quot;Severed Ties Yield Severed Heads&quot; by It Dies Today. <br/>
 <br/>
Now, despite his taste in music, Julian is a sweet, mellow guy. Not being a  <br/>
proponent of violence against women, he wasn&#39;t impressed with the message in <br/>
the  song. Plus, he added, the band really sucks. LOL<br/>
 <br/>
Listen with her, let her teach you stuff, and talk. Julian is NOT into  <br/>
hip-hop, but we were very impressed recently when Kanye West called for rappers  <br/>
and hip-hoppers to stop gay bashing.<br/>
