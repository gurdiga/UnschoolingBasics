<div id="ygrps-yiv-376398737">&quot;Kids are just off the wall the week before Christmas.  Mine fight <br/>
over candy canes while I stand there looking pretty imbecilic,  or <br/>

<br/>
My kids aren&#39;t &quot;off the wall&quot; the week before Christmas...though <br/>
there is a high level of excitement. They don&#39;t fight over candy <br/>
canes because they can have them any time they want.<br/>
If sugar isn&#39;t controlled, the children don&#39;t have any reason to <br/>
fight over it, nor act more needy in regards to it.<br/>
Mine WILL ask for things like trail mix or other healthy <br/>
alternatives when they&#39;ve had enough sugar. Sugar isn&#39;t the cause of <br/>
hyper behavior, it&#39;s sugar with a lack of protein that makes one <br/>
feel cranky or &quot;off&quot;. Make sure they have a platter of high protein <br/>
snacks sitting around and I&#39;ll bet the craziness will level out.<br/>
<br/>
Mine often ask for &quot;treats&quot; at the store...this means a food they <br/>
don&#39;t want to share with the rest of the family. Sierra&#39;s &quot;treat&quot; <br/>
the other night was two cans of olives!:) Trevor&#39;s is usually Twix <br/>
bars. If food is food, there isn&#39;t the same reaction to sugar foods. <br/>
I can&#39;t tell you how many times my kids have thrown candy away or <br/>
said &quot;I need some REAL food Mom&quot; (meaning hot meals).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Boy, have we noticed this in our house. One time,<br/>
along about FEBRUARY, we still had some grungy old<br/>
halloween candy sitting around that my kids were using<br/>
to play store with, and my neice and nephew came to<br/>
stay for the day, and they were actually throwing each<br/>
other to the ground, wrestling and pounding each<br/>
others heads on the floor over a hairy, linty piece of<br/>
old tootsie roll or something gross and inedible,<br/>
because they were so strictly controlled at their<br/>
house they couldn&#39;t believe there was a piece of candy<br/>
lying, uneaten!  My kids just stood on staring with<br/>
these wide eyes, unable to comprehend why anyone would<br/>
fight over a hairy tootsie roll....<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is true at our home also.  Logan did go trick or treating this year and <br/>
most of it is still in a box in his room.  Brenna occasionally asks him for a <br/>
piece and he tells her go ahead (she didn&#39;t go trick or treating).  Candy is <br/>
always around and chips and ice cream.  If the neighbor kids don&#39;t come by <br/>
often to eat the ice cream we have been known to throw it out when it gets a <br/>
little old.<br/>
<br/>
Logan often has tuna on crackers for breakfast while Brenna will eat carrot <br/>
cake.  There is just no emotion to a certain type of food except we like most <br/>
of it.  When I ask if they want anything at the store it might be artichokes or <br/>
sour cream dip but very rarely is it anything sweet.  <br/>
<br/>
This summer when my stepdaughter was with us, she ate so many M&M&#39;s cookies <br/>
that she got sick and threw up.  Not just once but on two different occasions.  <br/>
When I talked with her about it, she said she was afraid the other kids were <br/>
going to eat them all.  I told her we&#39;d just buy more.  By the time she went <br/>
home, I think she was starting to get the idea that all kinds of  food would be <br/>
available to her while she was at our house.   No need to binge or hoard.  <br/>
Since food is not an issue in our family it seems we  make healthy choices most <br/>
of the time. <br/>
<br/>
Not only are our food choices healthier but since I have stopped controlling <br/>
sleep and chores and T.V. watching and video games our family is healthier and <br/>
happier .  It didn&#39;t happen overnight but it&#39;s been like this long enough <br/>
that I can&#39;t imagine our lives any other way. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1676691623">Poor dh came home with ice cream the other day and was disappointed <br/>
the kids weren&#39;t excited about it. I had to explain that they&#39;d just <br/>
finished some corn on the cob that they&#39;d &quot;demanded&quot; after seeing <br/>
someone on tv eat it. ;-)<br/>
