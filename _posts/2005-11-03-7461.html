As the one who started this topic, I have no problem<br/>
with where you all have gone.  I mean, talk about an<br/>
awesome example of unschooling!  We started with one<br/>
area that led to another and you both are very very<br/>
inspiring.  The joy you have for what you do, shines<br/>
through.  <br/>
<br/>
I was in the Navy for four years and I never LOVED it<br/>
like you two LOVE what you do.  Two women who LOVE<br/>
dogs, making a living from it, continuing things on<br/>
the side that they enjoy, AND unschooling their<br/>
children?  Wow, this is truly an amazing and talented<br/>
group. :-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Happy Learning,<br/>
