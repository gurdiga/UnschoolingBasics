<div id="ygrps-yiv-684079372">Hiya all!  My 6yr old son is into dinos big time.  More to the  point Dino <br/>
bones.  Today was a nicer day here in IL so he went out to  play!  Was digging <br/>
in the yard for bones (daddy wasn&#39;t so much thinking  this was a good idea but <br/>
shh daddy wasn&#39;t home).  After about an hr doing  this he comes running into <br/>
the house SO EXCITED he had found some bones (Holy  Crap eww mom was thinking <br/>
cause im pretty sure it was the jaw of a kitty)   anyhow he pulls out all his <br/>
books and flys through them to find out what kind  they are.  Moms vote is for <br/>
a plant eating flying kind.  Jacob on the  other hand is convinced he has <br/>
discovered Trex bones.  This was just so  exciting to me as the middle of last yr <br/>
when we pulled him out of school he was  so traumatizes (teacher had labeled <br/>
the 2 jacobs the good jacob and the bad  jacob... my amazingly energitic baby <br/>
was the bad jacob) that I feared hed ever  be excited like this again!!  So <br/>
today was a good day!!<br/>
