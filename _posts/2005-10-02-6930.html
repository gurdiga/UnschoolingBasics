<div id="ygrps-yiv-191590858">I know a lot of people are off to L&L, and I&#39;ve got great <br/>
inspirational several posts saved from a lot of the experienced <br/>
unschoolers on this site, but I also wanted to ask if anyone could <br/>
help me with some words of wisdom.<br/>
<br/>
This is our first year homeschooling (unschooling!) and I&#39;m still not <br/>
in a place where I can &quot;spout off&quot; easily about unschooling.  The <br/>
local homeschooling group I belong to is having a homeschooling info <br/>
night next week and I&#39;ve volunteered to be on the panel <br/>
of &quot;homeschoolers&quot;.  I&#39;d like to share our story of how we came, <br/>
first, to homeschooling and then discovered unschooling.   I want to <br/>
keep it short, and positive (not slam the public schools, you never <br/>
know who&#39;s in the audience).   I can certainly talk about our own <br/>
experience as a family who pulled a child from public school in <br/>
middle school, but was wondering if anyone had any thoughts on how I <br/>
can &quot;gently&quot; introduce unschooling, from the point of view of someone <br/>
who &quot;gets it&quot; but is still new to the concept, so as to &quot;open the <br/>
door&quot; and encourage those who are considering homeschooling and may <br/>
be where I was, less than 2 years ago, being drawn to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for indulging me!<br/>

ago, being drawn to unschooling.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One thing I did when I explained to my dad about unschooling was to draw on<br/>
his own experiences and use them as an example of how unschooling works.<br/>
You won&#39;t be able to do this personally with an audience, but you could give<br/>
examples, maybe.  I pointed out in all the following examples how he was<br/>
self motivated to learn about something and how he followed through and<br/>
studied something because he wanted to, because he was interested in it.<br/>
Kids are no different.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, my dad is a self-taught computer guy. He learned all about<br/>
computers from messing around with them.  He is also a wonderful woodworker.<br/>
He makes hardwood furniture of a high quality and sometimes sells pieces.<br/>
He taught himself that too.  Over the years he has had different interests,<br/>
like Ham Radio and GPSing etc. and he learned about them because he had an<br/>
interest in them.  Some of the people who are best in their field are people<br/>
who didn&#39;t go to school for something, but who found something that<br/>
interested them and they followed their passion.<br/>
<br/>
We went to a fair in NY when we were visiting and the guy who was working in<br/>
one of the demonstration areas was so much fun to listen to and watch.  He<br/>
was using tool from the 1700 and 1800&#39;s to make furniture and he shared a<br/>
vast amount of knowledge about them as he worked.  He also had a great sense<br/>
of humor.  He didn&#39;t go to school to learn about all those tools and how<br/>
they were used.  He learned about them because it interested him and now he<br/>
shares that knowledge with others who are interested.  (And people pay him<br/>
to do it.)  <br/>
<br/>
That said, I&#39;ve been unschooling my kids since they became school aged (6<br/>
years) and I still have a hard time explaining things to some people.  (But<br/>
you still need to make them memorize their times tables don&#39;t you?)  It<br/>
seems to be worse for me when the person I am explaining to doesn&#39;t seem<br/>
very open to it.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
My dad bought his first computer less than 10 years ago and he&#39;ll be <br/>
81 this year!   He does woodworking too, but he&#39;s done it all his <br/>
life (he was a draftman when he was in the workforce, mostly <br/>
designing &quot;things&quot; before the age of computers that do it now with <br/>
software), built his house, built a boat, builds furniture, makes <br/>
wooden bowls and other turned wood items, but in actuality he <br/>
probably taught himself to do these things because he was interested <br/>
in doing them).    Just wanted to comment on the connection, I <br/>
haven&#39;t said anything to my dad about unschooling, he&#39;s not saying <br/>
much about homeschooling except &#39;do you know what she needs to learn&#39; <br/>
and I just reassure him I&#39;m well prepared and leave it at that.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You won&#39;t be able to do this personally with an audience, but you <br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s a good idea.  When I read about it it shake my head and <br/>
go &quot;yes, yes! that makes so much sense!&quot; but find it difficult to <br/>
talk about it in a confident and experienced way because we&#39;re so new <br/>
to it and are just beginning to live this way.   But I CAN talk about <br/>
THAT, because it is our reality.   I don&#39;t expect to sound like an <br/>
expert on unschooling, so I think if I focus on the fact that we are <br/>
just beginning to embrace unschooling while homeschooling, maybe that <br/>
will be a better way to approach it.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I like this and will work it in!<br/>

<br/>
Funny, you could be describing my dh!   He&#39;s got his ham license, <br/>
loves GPS and also has become a wiz about computers, because he was <br/>
interested in them (he&#39;s now working on his degree in IT, only <br/>
because he wants to, but he is a &quot;success&quot; in his job without it).  I <br/>
HAVE talked to him about these things when describing unschooling <br/>
(he&#39;s totally supportive of homeschooling, he had problems fitting <br/>
into school and always felt &quot;stupid&quot;), he doesn&#39;t quite get it <br/>
(unschooling, child led learning etc) but at least he &quot;gets&quot; when I <br/>
relate it personally to him in these areas.<br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
Yes, I get that too or &quot;but if she decides to go back to school, <br/>
won&#39;t she be behind&quot; or &quot;what about a high school diploma&quot; and I <br/>
start talking about not really needing one to get into college, <br/>
taking community college courses as a teen etc etc and I usually get <br/>
blank looks (that&#39;s if they&#39;re genuinly interested, if they&#39;re NOT <br/>
open to it, as you put it, I get the look like I have 3 heads LOL!)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your input Angela!    You&#39;ve given me some good points.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s exactly MY father! He&#39;ll be 64 in 2 days and is a also a  drafter. <br/>
He&#39;s itching to retire now because of the use of &quot;computers&quot;, which he  just <br/>
doesn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; lol... He&#39;s not even a telephone person. But, he has learned  enough <br/>
of the computer to be able to play games and to surf the net for stuff  he&#39;s <br/>
interested in. He also is a woodworker, built their house (which is  <br/>
unfinished... he ALSO has a habit of starting 101 projects and NOT finishing  them). He <br/>
has made furniture of excellent quality, as well as some toys for the  kids.<br/>
He has an Associate&#39;s Degree in Tool Design, but that&#39;s not what got him  his <br/>
nice, cushy job. He taught himself how to use his CAD program that he was  <br/>
&quot;forced&quot; to use. <br/>
 <br/>
Funny enough, he&#39;s never given a thought about his feelings about us  <br/>
homeschooling. My mom is on board with us, as is my mother-in-law, so I  thankfully <br/>
have family support. They see the kids learning and growing, and  that&#39;s good <br/>
enough for them. My son is learning to read right now, and watching  him do <br/>
this is fascinating. Well, this morning was funny... &quot;P-O-O-P spells  poop, <br/>
right?&quot; @@ Yes, Dan... LOL  <br/>
