<div id="ygrps-yiv-1116565894">&quot;in my mind I definitely wasn&#39;t thinking that you<br/>
said or that I would believe that the adult would choose what&#39;s too <br/>
scary<br/>
and what&#39;s not, just that the adult would be aware and talk about it <br/>
with<br/>
their child.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I agree then.:)<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like your dd has a mixture of sensitivity issues, plus a <br/>
situation that made her feel unsafe that contributed to the <br/>
sensitivity.<br/>
I bet that over time, with a safe place to deal with these issues, <br/>
she&#39;ll lighten up a bit. Developmental phases seem to happen <br/>
overnight sometimes. She may always be more cautious about violence <br/>
or intense subject matter though.<br/>
Isn&#39;t it great that our children have the opportunity to know <br/>
themselves and be honored just as they are, today.<br/>
I love the freedom of the unschooling life!<br/>
