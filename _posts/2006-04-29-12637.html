<div id="ygrps-yiv-707758802">My middle child Shawna (age 10) has been participating in a 3 month <br/>
long storytelling club since January. It was run by two members (a <br/>
mother and her 18 year old son, both who are part of our homeschool <br/>
group) of the Ocala Storytellers Guild. Each child (there were six <br/>
of them) picked their own story and each week they would work on it. <br/>
By the end, they had to be able to tell it from memory, use facial <br/>
and body language and vocally become the different charcaters. The <br/>
club ended this past week and they held their storytelling concert <br/>
this afternoon.  <br/>
<br/>
Shawna told her story (The Boy Who Was a Noodlehead), in front of 30-<br/>
35 adults and children....an a stage, with a microphone...by memory. <br/>
After she was finished, my husband turned to me and said &quot;She&#39;s <br/>
shining up there.&quot; And she was. :-) <br/>
<br/>
This, coming from a child that *truly* did not start to live her <br/>
life until we took her out of school and out of therapy (speech, <br/>
occupational, physical and mental health) a year after we adopted <br/>
her. Shawna had always been,...facially expressionless is the best <br/>
way I can describe it. I was questioned about it several times <br/>
actually, by teachers and therapists. After a while though, I <br/>
started noticing that when she read outloud to someone, she came <br/>
alive and became the character! It was so unlike her. When I saw the <br/>
sign for the storytelling club, I thought this would be something <br/>
Shawna would enjoy because of that. <br/>
<br/>
She was so awesome! She got up on the stage like she owned it and <br/>
was full of confidence. I&#39;m going to blog about it when I get my <br/>
pictures developed but I just had to share it here. :-) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-365996119">The story was called &quot;The boy who sold the butter&quot; not what I <br/>
previously posted. He was called a noodlehead in the story several <br/>
times so that&#39;s what i thought the title was. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1364210031">Oh what a super story!  I&#39;ve always been fascinated by storytelling.  <br/>
I have always thought it would be so fantastic to be a part of such a <br/>
group.  What a neat opportunity!<br/>
