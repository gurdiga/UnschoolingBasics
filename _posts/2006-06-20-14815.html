wouldn&#39;t surprise me a bit if snakes were the next thing on my son&#39;s<br/>
agenda.~<br/>

Very cool!<br/>
Corn snakes make really great pets.<br/>
<br/>
We once had a tarantula named &quot;Rosie&quot;. She died when her molt didn&#39;t<br/>
complete (apparently that happens occasionally with them).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-621531270">My son has mentioned spiders as pets before.  Right now, it&#39;s impossible because we&#39;re in Hawaii and tarantulas aren&#39;t allowed- which is perfectly okay with me.. I&#39;m an arachnophobe!  It&#39;s selfish, but I hope he loses interest by the time we move back to the mainland.  I&#39;m scared to death of all spiders.<br/>
