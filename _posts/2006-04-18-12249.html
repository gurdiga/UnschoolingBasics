 </span></blockquote>Yes, and this is a good reason to be careful anytime you see a scary  <br/>
statistic like &quot;five times as likely.&quot; It&#39;s not too meaningful if you  <br/>
don&#39;t know what is being multiplied! For instance, when I was  <br/>
thinking about getting pregnant with my first, I read up on the  <br/>
health risks of pregnancy for fat women (I weighed 247 at the time).  <br/>
Right at that time, there was a story going around in the media about  <br/>
how overweight  women were twice as likely to have babies with neural  <br/>
tube defects like spina bifida (there&#39;s also an example of  <br/>
sensationalizing, because the stories always chose the most disabling  <br/>
possibility as the example of what a neural tube defect is, rather  <br/>
than some of the less severe ones, but I digress), and really fat  <br/>
women like me four times as likely.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, some digging revealed that in the general population, neural  <br/>
tube defects occur in about .2 percent (not 2 %-- .2 percent, or 2 in  <br/>
a thousand births). Four times that, even if that holds true over  <br/>
additional studies, means someone like me still has a better than 99%  <br/>
chance of having a baby with no neural tube defect. Hardly worth  <br/>
panicking over.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is the sort of scare tactics that have been used to justify automatic<br/>
repeat c/s on women who have had a previous c/s.  The statistic says that a<br/>
woman who has had a c/s is 50% more likely to have a uterine rupture than a<br/>
woman who has not had any uterine surgeries.  That sounds like a drastic<br/>
leap, but the truth is the incidence of uterine rupture in a woman who has<br/>
never had uterine surgery is .05%  Yes point 05%.  that is such a low<br/>
number.  Yet it is this abuse of percentages that have caused doctors to shy<br/>
away from VBAC&#39;s.  Now to complicate this matter even more, the use of some<br/>
modern labor enhancing drugs have increased the uterine rupture of women who<br/>
have never had any uterine surgeries from .05% to .1% yet these same drugs<br/>
have increased the uterine rupture rate in previously surgeried uteri to<br/>
.5%.  Yet they don&#39;t tell you those rates. What they say is that the<br/>
incidence of uterine rupture is increased dramatically.  2 grains of sand<br/>
maybe twice as much as 1 grain of sand, but when compared to a beach it is<br/>
only 2 insignificant grains of sand.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-886115020">Here, here on statistics being used as a scare tactic.<br/>
<br/>
My first was a footling breech and therefore had to be a c/s.  My <br/>
other two were delivered vaginally.  With both I had a GREAT doc who <br/>
looked at real facts instead of what everyone else was claiming.<br/>
<br/>
I did a lot of research on VBAC prior to my second.  The rates for a <br/>
uterine rupture in a VBAC and a women with no previous uterine <br/>
surgeries is roughly the same.  It&#39;s close enough, in fact, that if <br/>
it&#39;s true women shouldn&#39;t VBAC in facilities that can&#39;t do an <br/>
emergency c/s, it&#39;s also true NO women should labor there b/c the <br/>
chances of needing one are about the same.<br/>
<br/>
I got &quot;stuck&quot; at 6&quot; with both my youngest two, we tried tricks, but <br/>
I ended up needing pitocin to get me to 10&quot;.  Luckily, my doc agreed <br/>
to give it rather than just do another c/s. Every other doc at the <br/>
hosp would have performed a c/s without discussion. Neither delivery <br/>
was a problem and both babies were healthy.  The rates of uterine <br/>
rupture only increase SLIGHTLY with pitocin in VBACs.  <br/>
<br/>
However, research has shown this is only true for women who are <br/>
already effaced and therefore basically ready to labor.  If you give <br/>
a VBAC prostaglandins (sp?) to soften the cervix, uterine rupture <br/>
sky-rockets to 1 in 41 women.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess Mother Nature accepts suggestions and a little help, but <br/>
doesn&#39;t like being told what to do!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1841045463">Hi  Everyone,<br/>
   <br/>
  my name is Sandy I live on Vancouver island  British Colombia Canada and I am new to all of this!<br/>
   <br/>
  If I can give you Little bit of history with myself and children. My oldest is Alisha is 15 the Adrian 13  Addison almost 8 and Natalia 6.<br/>
   <br/>
  The first two were born in a hospital and second two at home. My eldest has struggled all he life with school a I did. At the age of nine I seriously thought of home schooling yet I didn&#39;t know how, I researched a lot and met many home schoolers through my home birhts and felt the inner calling of knowing this for me was the way it was meant to be.<br/>
   <br/>
  My second child Adrian is Autistic and I was having a lot of challenges and and then at that time a toddler and baby . I thought to myself I must be crazy thinking I cant do this I&#39;m  a hormonal mess and have my own healing journey that gives me the strength to hold all that I do, this would only make it worse for everyone.<br/>
   <br/>
  So I made a second choice Waldorf. It  was good for a while for my oldest until she got a real dogmatic teacher and Having all Indigo children they tend not to conform very well much to the teachers dismay.<br/>
   <br/>
  My youngest son said why do they talk to us  like babies around here.  The youngest one has been doing very well at Waldorf but she loves all the kinds of stuff that they offer it kind of her normal interests anyways, and she only in kidegarten where waldorf just plays..<br/>
   <br/>
  My autistic child is in a public school  where there really pushing him because he really high functioning . He said why do I have to go to school when threres everything we need to learn in nature or I just like to fix things.<br/>
   <br/>
  Right now I am getting my BA in psychology and trans personal psychology based on A course in miracles.  So a lot of has been about  are healing journey so that we can be congruent when were helping others heal.<br/>
   <br/>
  One of the things that always comes up for me is how the school system ruined so much of my being and not having the support at home either was a double whammy.<br/>
   <br/>
  I was very much an expiertial learner loaded with creativity and they did  not teach the way I learnded so I always thought I was very stupid.That I didn&#39;t measure up.<br/>
   <br/>
  I know will all my kids and the different variations of Indigo I have in my home has always concerned me what do I do thats best for them.<br/>
   <br/>
  I feel like I cant run from the truth of wanting to be congruent in all areas of my life and this one area is the biggest of them all, my children.<br/>
   <br/>
  I have all the fears screaming at me how can you do this, your too hormonal to be with your kids all the time, You don&#39;t know what to do.<br/>
   <br/>
  YOu need your space , how are going to do your school work, its to late the damage is done and there&#39;s nothing you can do.  I am afraid  I sound selfish.<br/>
   <br/>
  I don&#39;t have a clue when two want to go for a nature walk and two donthow I will work this, they all have such different needs.<br/>
   <br/>
  What if I fail and screw them up even more than the school has and choices I have  too?????<br/>
   <br/>
  I need some strong encouragement with some ideas. Jan from the unschooling web site does counselling and suggested that I join this group.<br/>
   <br/>
  Any thoughts??? ................Namaste Sandy<br/>

Induction with pitocin doesn&#39;t really increase risk.  It&#39;s the use <br/>
prostaglandins that equal high risk.  I don&#39;t think anyone really <br/>
knows if that&#39;s an effect of the prostaglanins or the fact that if <br/>
you aren&#39;t effaced you aren&#39;t ready to labor, anyway!!<br/>

But yes, take statistics with a grain of salt.<br/>

not to conform very well much to the teachers dismay.<br/>

in my<br/>
home has always concerned me what do I do thats best for them.***<br/>

I think you need to dump that Indigo label as SOON as possible and just <br/>
see each one for Who He Is now.<br/>

<br/>
Right, but you don&#39;t have to choose either of those for your own <br/>
children! You can never send them back to school, AND you can suppot <br/>
them completely at home.<br/>

selfish.***<br/>

First: take a DEEEP breath!<br/>

Next: just BE with them. Be joyful. Quit looking for the negative, for <br/>
the failures. Make popcorn. Watch a movie (or three). Make your own <br/>
individual pizzas. Brush their hair. Look for the joy in every <br/>
moment---and quit fussing!<br/>

A good start would be to ask yourself, &quot;What are my goals for my <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1576643849">Thankyou  Kelly,<br/>
   <br/>
  Yes your words brought tears to my eyes and mirrored back all that I know within to be true.<br/>
   <br/>
  I  am actually a very postive person, but had to voice the fears. On a spiritual level this to me is about oneness.<br/>
   <br/>
  The goal are not that hard for my children<br/>
   <br/>
  Inner Peace <br/>
  To find the things that bring them Joy in Life.<br/>
   <br/>
  To love self and others equally.<br/>
   <br/>
  To live there passions.<br/>
   <br/>
  To be free to be who they are.<br/>
   <br/>
  To be fully alive and live life to the fullest finding there own inner purposes.<br/>
   <br/>
  Thank you...............Blessings and Love Sandy<br/>
