<div id="ygrps-yiv-1752666457">If your state is listed here, please write me a little blurb about  <br/>
how it works to UNSCHOOL in your state. If your state law makes it  <br/>
easy, then just say so. But if your state law requires some kind of  <br/>
reporting, testing, portfolio, assessment, or anything else, please  <br/>
explain how unschoolers handle that. I&#39;m looking for whatever  <br/>
information you&#39;d like to give about how people manage to unschool in  <br/>
your state.<br/>
<br/>
ALSO, if you have information about how people can get in touch with  <br/>
other unschoolers in your state, please include that information.<br/>
<br/>
AND - last - please rate your state - how easy is it to unschool  <br/>
there? Scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being easiest.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks -<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1578621119">Hi Pam,<br/>
<br/>
I tried twice to send this to your off-list email, and<br/>
both times it bounced back as undeliverable.  I don&#39;t<br/>
know what the problem is -- the notices made no sense<br/>
to me.<br/>
<br/>
Here is my state info:<br/>
<br/>
New Mexico here - unschooling is very easy here, with<br/>
only a legal requirement that we register as<br/>
homeschoolers and the parent have a high school<br/>
diploma or equivalent.  In my experience, the<br/>
requirement is largely un-enforced, having been late<br/>
in registering a couple of times.  I know other<br/>
unschoolers here who never register, and never get<br/>
&#39;found out.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
As to rating, probably a 9.5, maybe a 10. I understand<br/>
that in Oklahoma, there&#39;s not even a requirement to<br/>
register, and in Texas, one only has to establish a<br/>
private school at the home address and anything else<br/>
is okay from there.  Then again, I have no desire to<br/>
live in either OK or TX and I love NM, so that makes<br/>
it<br/>
easily a 10 in my book!<br/>
<br/>
Sylvia<br/>
