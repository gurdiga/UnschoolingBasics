<br/>
The Dr. Phil show will be airing what homeschoolers in California<br/>
think will be a very anti-homeschooling show this Friday. It was<br/>
originally scheduled to be aired a month ago, but it was moved to the<br/>
day after Thanksgiving. Some homeschoolers wrote in and complained<br/>
after the taping, and the date was rescheduled, perhaps because they<br/>
thought fewer people might be watching.<br/>
<br/>
Several California Homeschool Network local contacts were invited to<br/>
be in the audience, and one of them wrote a detailed accounting that<br/>
others  who were there agreed was an accurate description of the<br/>
experience. It was originally discussed on the CaliforniaHS Yahoo<br/>
list, and Annette Hall put it on her website, so others could easily<br/>
refer to it: http://localhs. com/scuttle/ 2006/10/great- school-debate. asp<br/>
<br/>
Dr. Phil&#39;s website now has a promotional video clip of the show you<br/>
can watch to get an idea of how it&#39;s going to go: http://drphil. com/<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-456033001">Thanks for the update Amanda... Maybe I should call my mom when Dr. Phil is<br/>
on, so that she&#39;ll be tied up on the phone and won&#39;t watch the show!   <br/>
