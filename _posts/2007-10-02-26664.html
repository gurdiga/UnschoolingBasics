All of us (4 of us, DW, dd1 (almost 6) and dd2 (4.5) are going on a<br/>
week-long vacation to that area.  Aaaaaannnnnddd, we&#39;re looking for stuff to<br/>
do, places to go, and also suggestions for a place to stay.  If there&#39;s<br/>
anyone in the area who would like to meet up and/or lend a room for a<br/>
night?  We&#39;re doing this on the cheap, so any suggestions would be helpful.<br/>
We are looking through the net and various other services, but there&#39;s<br/>
nothing like first-hand knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll be in the area roughly Sunday-ish on through Thursday or Friday.  But<br/>
we must be in Waterloo, IL on Saturday.  Any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
Please reply directly to me.  Thanks for your time.<br/>
<br/>
