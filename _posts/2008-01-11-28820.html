I&#39;m a newbie here, but my hubby works for Blizzard (who makes WoW), so I<br/>
asked him about this.  It is illegal to run a private server for WoW.  There<br/>
is also a chance (and this happens all the time, actually), that the person<br/>
running the private server would hack your system.  In addition, there may<br/>
not be (and probably aren&#39;t) backups for your data, any support for<br/>
problems, updates to the software (which often happens every few weeks),<br/>
etc.  Personally, sounds like a lot of frustration potential to me!  But I<br/>
can see the draw in playing on a private server anyway, so long as you are<br/>
aware of the risks.<br/>

One more piece of info for you from my hubby, according to the terms of<br/>
service and end user agreement for Blizzard, you could have your account<br/>
banned if you were involved with a private server.  Not certain how likely<br/>
it would be to actually happen, but again it&#39;s nice to have all the<br/>
information before deciding what to do. :-)<br/>
