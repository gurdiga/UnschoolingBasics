<div id="ygrps-yiv-1441679581">Okay, so I am not new to unschooling but this is my favorite list so I am<br/>
going to go ahead and ask for advice here. <br/>
<br/>
I could really use some advice with an ongoing issue at our house. We have 2<br/>
small neighbor friends who live behind us-boy is 5 and girl is 3. (Mine are<br/>
almost 8-dd and 10ds) The little boy is at school most days and comes over<br/>
to play after school. The little girl usually comes over first thing in the<br/>
morning and stays all day, usually until about 9pm. The first few months<br/>
were okay. Lately I find myself getting more and more frustrated with the<br/>
situation. My dd wants so much to play with this little girl. She is very<br/>
social and loves to have friends over. When the little girl is over the 3<br/>
(or 4) kids fight a lot. There is a lot of screaming and yelling as I try to<br/>
get the situation under control and find out what is going on. They run<br/>
through the house, sometimes knocking things over, and when I ask them to<br/>
please go run outside or I try to find something else to occupy them my dd<br/>
gets very nasty with me or throws a fit and starts screaming and crying.<br/>
They go to the pantry many times a day even though I try to keep special<br/>
snacks just for them. It wouldn&#39;t be an issue except that right now we are<br/>
struggling financially. They make a huge mess in my dds room and when I ask<br/>
them to help my dd pick up my dd throws a fit and they all just sit there<br/>
and look at me. My dd tells me that the little boy calls me terrible names<br/>
when I am not around and tells her not to listen to me. They go into my room<br/>
and play with my things and when I ask them to please find somewhere else to<br/>
play my dd argues with me and tells me how mean I am. There is constant<br/>
chaos in our house. My dd is getting very rude and belligerent towards me<br/>
and her brother. By the end of the day I feel totally drained. I don&#39;t want<br/>
to be around anyone. I don&#39;t feel like being loving and caring. I feel like<br/>
running away. My son tells me just to send them home but I feel that it<br/>
shouldn&#39;t be all about me. I really want to accommodate her needs as best I<br/>
can. Right now I feel like the meanest mom in the world. I miss my daughter.<br/>
I feel that we don&#39;t have time together anymore but when I ask her if they<br/>
can maybe come over another day she cries and argues with me. She says she<br/>
NEEDS her friend. How do I accommodate my dd and her needs and keep from<br/>
loosing my mind at the same time? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance, <br/>

  I know there are more qualified mom&#39;s in this list that not only can express themselves better but have way more<br/>
  experience.<br/>
  It sounds like this is happening almost everyday.<br/>
  If that is the case I would just get out of the house. Find lots of things to do outside that my kids love to do.<br/>
  Maybe once a week or two the most I would be home for half a day and the neighbors kids would come over. After a few weeks I think that things would change.<br/>
  I would also talk the other mom that you are overwhelmed with the kids being there a lot.<br/>
  I find it really strange that a 3 year old would want to spend that much time without their mom.<br/>
  They must not like to hang out with her and no wonder they tell your kids that you are mean. They don&#39;t know any other type of mom.<br/>
  IT might be hard to be away all day but it might be worth it.<br/>
  I am a homebody but if I was in this situation I would call the mom and also be unavailable for a while. I would get my kids to other places and maybe they would make new friends and <br/>
  that could also help.<br/>
  Again I don&#39;t know the details to the situation.<br/>
  I am sure someone more qualified will have great ideas.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2008680060">Where is this 3 year olds Mom that she is at your house till 9 pm at night?  I&#39;m sure others will have better advice.  I am also new to unschooling.  I try to accomodate my children&#39;s needs to socialize with the neighborhood kids too, and most days it all works out fine.  But there are times I have to tell the neighborhood kids to go home.  And their are times I have to limit the snacks too.  We live in a neighborhood with lots of kids and they could clear my pantry in no time at all.......I can&#39;t afford to feed the neighborhood either.  <br/>

I have been through this, and my opinion is that any child of three who is over at your house from early in the morning until 9pm has alot of neglect going on. I have been through this twice. When my daughter was 8, another little girl who showed up in the neighborhood would come over ALL DAY.  At first I did not mind, except that there were numerous &quot;red flags&quot; about the child and her &quot;parents&quot; never called to check up on her. My daughter was extremely kind toward her, and offered to &quot;share her mommy&quot; with her. One day my daughter was in tears because I could not afford to buy the girl a Xmas present in the price range my daughter wanted. She implored me, saying &quot;I just want Crystal to be happy!&quot; Maybe you should get more involved in whats going on and observe the girl and try to find out why there is so much conflict. Obviously she prefers your home to her own, and there may or may not be a good reason for that. Its really difficult to &quot;parent&quot; some vagabond neighborhood child so<br/>
metimes, but I really regret not taking more of an interest in Crystal, especially since she ended up in foster care somewhere and I cant find her. <br/>

I am usually a lurker here, but I your post compelled me to chime in, <br/>
though I certainly am no expert and don&#39;t know the details of your <br/>
situation.  But I have to admit I&#39;m, well, shocked, that the mother of <br/>
a 3-yr-old would allow her to spend the entire day and evening in <br/>
someone else&#39;s care... Can you yourself imagine doing that? I can&#39;t. I <br/>
find this situation to be really troubling... Where is this child&#39;s <br/>
mother??<br/>
You say you want to accommodate your daughter&#39;s needs, but I feel very <br/>
strongly that you need to take care of yourself and your family <br/>
first.  This may not be a popular view to put out on this list, but I <br/>
don&#39;t think that unschooling needs to include allowing an unhealthy <br/>
situation to persist, just because your daughter would like it to.<br/>
I think your son is very wise here---just SEND HER HOME. Is setting <br/>
limits going against unschooling?  I don&#39;t think your life should be a <br/>
free-for-all at your expense.  Your needs are just as important as <br/>
your daughter&#39;s.  I think a frank conversation with the mother of this <br/>
little girl to let her know the effect this is having on your family <br/>
might be really needed here (if that&#39;s possible).<br/>
Sorry if I sound worked up over this... I am struggling with my own <br/>
questions about unschooling vs. setting limits. You are the grown-up <br/>
here and you have rights, needs and a gut-feeling that this sitation <br/>
is not working for you.  Go with your gut.  That would be my advice.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-657528931">~<br/>
Where is this 3 year olds Mom that she is at your house till 9 pm at<br/>
night?~<br/>
<br/>
Exactly.<br/>
I&#39;m sorry, but I don&#39;t feel compelled to raise someone elses child in<br/>
order to please someone else in my family. If my child wanted to be<br/>
around another child, I can certainly accomodate playdates without<br/>
letting that child disrupt my entire life and eat all my food. I think<br/>
taking care of your own children is the priority.<br/>
<br/>
If she really likes this child, maybe you could accompany her to the<br/>
other house and have a playdate there, with you present. I would voice<br/>
my concerns about such small children being absent from the parent!<br/>
That is really worrisome.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone should expect their entire house to be disrupted.<br/>
I would state my needs and concerns very clearly to my child and<br/>
explain that it is not my job to care for these other<br/>
children...obviously they have parents that should be doing their job.<br/>
<br/>
If an adult was disrupting my house, causing fighting and eating my<br/>
food, I would have no problem sending them home. I think your son has<br/>
the right idea. If your daughter is so bonded to them that she&#39;s<br/>
willing to put up with the problems, there needs to be some discussion<br/>
about how to meet everyone&#39;s needs. I&#39;m not willing to let my<br/>
household be disrupted for someone elses child that I&#39;m NOT<br/>
responsible for. The other concern is that if the parents are so<br/>
willing to neglect their children, how will they respond if one of<br/>
them gets hurt at your house? Something to consider.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t about ignoring your own needs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1412142459">Sorry it&#39;s taken me so long to respond. We were out of town for a couple of<br/>
days.<br/>
<br/>
The Grandmother and extended family are raising the children. Yes, a very<br/>
dysfunctional family, every last one of them-8 adults living in the house. I<br/>
don&#39;t know if you all remember but I mentioned these children a few months<br/>
ago-the little boy who was killing the kittens, chased my dd with a hammer,<br/>
bit her and beat her up and was calling her horrible names. They only play<br/>
in our house or in our yard with me or my son watching because my dds safety<br/>
was a concern. CPS is involved with the family. The grandma just started<br/>
working and grandpa works nights. Others are just in and out during the day.<br/>
Talking to the grandma is not an option. A few months ago I told the kids<br/>
that they needed to go home because my dh had had a long day and wanted some<br/>
quiet. The kids ran home crying and grandma called me. I tried to explain<br/>
but she screamed at me for a full five minutes before I hung up on her. She<br/>
didn&#39;t speak to me for 2 months, which I have to admit was kind of nice:-).<br/>
I try to avoid her as much as possible. I am not willing to deal with her.<br/>
As for getting out of the house, we only have our car a couple of days a<br/>
week. We have a motorcycle, a car and a truck. Since it&#39;s been cold my dh<br/>
takes my car (he has an hour drive to work on the highway) and the truck is<br/>
super expensive to gas up, but we will just have to. We live in a pretty<br/>
rural area. They are our only neighbors. It&#39;s kind of ironic. We moved from<br/>
the city to get away from so many neighbors and have some peace. We ended up<br/>
with the neighbors from hell. LOL<br/>
<br/>
I am going to take your great advice and have a talk with my dd. I think<br/>
having them over in the afternoon after the little boy gets out of school<br/>
until about dinner time will be good. In the mornings we can spend time<br/>
doing our own things together. Besides in the afternoon is when they seem to<br/>
have the most energy anyway. They will be ready to go run with their friends<br/>
by then.  I think it might be a good idea to brainstorm some new fun things<br/>
to do together in the mornings. Thank you all so much. I don&#39;t feel like<br/>
such a meanie now. I know we&#39;ll have to deal with some tears but I&#39;m sure if<br/>
I really talk with her about it she will understand. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-130764467">Dawn, somehow these children&#39;s parents have managed to get you to provide  <br/>
free childcare for their family, and your reluctance to do that has created  <br/>
turbulence in your family. <br/>
 <br/>
This is a very little girl, and it is weird that her parents are sending  her <br/>
off for hours a day to play with a much older child. I think your daughter  <br/>
is probably needing more friends to play with, and that is why she&#39;s reacting  <br/>
this way. But, yes, you need to send these children home. I would keep lines <br/>
of  communication open, because there could be problems there.<br/>
 <br/>
Can you get out of the house some more, particularly around other  kids?<br/>
