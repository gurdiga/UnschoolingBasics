<div id="ygrps-yiv-1045131826">I have a 6 year old and we are going to home school this year and<br/>
unschooling looks wonderful!  I also have a 4 year old and a 2 year old.<br/>
Now my 6 year old is a self taught avid reader and reads anything and<br/>
everything that he picks up and memorizes it.  He was spouting off details<br/>
of a timeline for trains and how they intersect to World War 1 and World War<br/>
2 timeline just this morning.  Anyway here is my question.<br/>
<br/>
Since he enjoys reading so much and just takes in everything is it<br/>
appropriate for him to have tons of curriculum choices, books, packets of<br/>
info on various subjects for him to use at his own discretion?  I don&#39;t want<br/>
to have &quot;school&quot; that doesn&#39;t appeal to either of us, but having materials<br/>
around that are fun to read or activities to do I think he will enjoy.  What<br/>
materials do you have in your homes and does having these items so that they<br/>
can be found and discovered gel with unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
I am asking because we don&#39;t have many books except the ones we get weekly<br/>
at the library or other resources for him currently to explore and I wonder<br/>
how having these things in the home can be used in an unschool manner.<br/>

<br/>
Strewing interesting stuff is great! <br/>
<br/>
OTOH some of the problems with packaged materials are that they are often<br/>
limited and limiting, sometimes dumbed down, sometimes full of errors,<br/>
structured to mirror a school curriculum in focus and sequence (only what<br/>
will be on the test), and may give the idea that this is how all information<br/>
*should* be presented (the right way) and all that is needed. Some material<br/>
has political or religious agendas behind it. Unschoolers don&#39;t seek to<br/>
divide the world into subjects, or unit studies. I guess I&#39;m saying caveat<br/>
emptor. <br/>
<br/>
We approach any of this stuff as a vanishingly small part of our activities.<br/>
The work book that Nan gave us (full of dumb inconsistencies) is piled in<br/>
with the rarely used coloring books. One key is not to have an expectation<br/>
that the materials will, or should be, used according to the instructions. <br/>
<br/>
The library and the internet are phenomenally good sources of real<br/>
information about stuff. What is he interested in?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Looking back on it now, I think I&#39;d spend less on stuff I thought was cool<br/>
and more on stuff that my daughter wanted. A lot of the stuff I chose has<br/>
sat unused. $50 on a video game she plays is a much better use of money than<br/>
$50 on great books that never get opened. My daughter has gotten way more<br/>
use out of stuffed animals than the Dorling Kindersley Encyclopedia I<br/>
bought.<br/>
<br/>
As a lover of great books it&#39;s hard for me to admit that the library and the<br/>
internet and TV (and videos) are better resources than shelves and shelves<br/>
of books at home. The truth won&#39;t stop me from buying books! But I&#39;ve slowed<br/>
way down.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve bought books that Kat wanted read over and over. We&#39;ve bought series<br/>
that she likes even if she won&#39;t necessarily read them again. I think those<br/>
are good uses of money.<br/>
<br/>
It depends on what your son loves. If he loves pouring over the details (or<br/>
having you pour over the details) of Usborne or DK books, get some. If he&#39;s<br/>
not looking longingly at something wondering when you can get it again when<br/>
you return something to the library, then the library is the best place for<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;d say spend money on things he likes and will use. Throw in some things<br/>
that you will use. And then have turn over of temporary things running<br/>
through his live, places to go (people to see! ;-). (Check out garage sales,<br/>
flea markets, Salvation Army, towns that have swap areas at their dumps too<br/>
so that you can take chances on cool things without investing much.)<br/>
<br/>
(Though I guess there should be a list of &quot;must haves&quot; like:<br/>
<br/>
map of the world (I like the Peter&#39;s Projection map since it shows more<br/>
accurate sizes of the countries and continents)<br/>
map of the US<br/>
globe<br/>
magnifying glasses<br/>
bug bottle<br/>
tops<br/>
pattern blocks<br/>
blank paper<br/>
pens/markers/crayons<br/>
computer with internet access)<br/>

I have to agree wholeheartedly and I am also a lover of books and have a hard time NOT buying them.  I also still find myself bringing home workbooks.  Not that they HAVE to do them but secretly, my schooled mind wants them to do the workbooks for &quot;fun&quot;.  I think so I can have the peace of mind and &quot;proof&quot; for those panicky moments.  &lt;SIGH&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I did get a DK Encyclopedia of animals that my son LOVES and he pretends to jump into it to learn about the animals.  (Think Stanley.)  He uses it in conjunction with the stuffed animals and PVC animals he has.  So I don&#39;t think not buying books of ANY kind is necessary but I do think I need to curb MY desire to have shelves and shelves of books and just grab the ones that will become lifelong favourites.<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, I actually was posting to say that to the list above I&#39;d add magnets.  We got a cool (very inexpensive) building set made of little magnets with metal balls but even before that we had some horseshoe magnets and my kids have done so much neat discovery/fun games with magnets.  That or any kind of building sets really.  I hear good things about K&#39;Nex though i haven&#39;t any yet or lego brand.  We build with the magnets now but maybe will invest in some K&#39;Nex soon.<br/>

I am  asking because we don&#39;t have many books except the ones we get weekly<br/>

how having these things in the home can be used in an unschool  manner.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
So why, if you go to the library every week, would you be worried about  <br/>
having &quot;tons of curriculum choices&quot;? For more books? Or just  textbooks? Textbooks <br/>
aren&#39;t the best source of correct information.<br/>
 <br/>
Usborne has some really great books that he might like. If I were going to  <br/>
invest some money in something, it would be their books (we have dozens---my  <br/>
favorite is the one on castles!). You could read about WWII or dinosaurs or dog <br/>
 training.<br/>
 <br/>
Actual living, breathing people would be my next suggestion. People who  have <br/>
LIVED it (like WWII vets)---or who are immersed in and passionate about it  <br/>
(like SCAers or dog trainers).<br/>
 <br/>
The third option would be to DO some of the things, like participate  in <br/>
living history museums/reinactments or go on a dinosaur dig or train the  dog.<br/>
 <br/>
For example----you could READ about unschooling, and you&#39;d learn a lot. You  <br/>
could come to the conference and learn MUCH more. Or you could UNSCHOOL  &lt;g&gt; <br/>
and learn the most! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
A bunch of textbooks would be a decent starting place, but he world is SO  <br/>
full of other ways to learn that I would explore *them*!<br/>
 <br/>
As far as what to have in the house and it &quot;works&quot; in an unschooling home,  <br/>
