<div id="ygrps-yiv-121737214">&quot;It&#39;s a wonderful example for me and my<br/>
kids, who might not find the same support and acceptance if our odd <br/>
little<br/>
family was in a traditional church setting.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well dang Michelle!! Did I know you went to UU?<br/>
One of my good friends teaches a Sunday school program, she&#39;s a <br/>
public school teacher so I always wondered what her class was like. <br/>
I almost ended up at UU this last Sunday but was too tired.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo....I&#39;m thinking I should take this offlist now. Do you know <br/>
know any of the Wolverton&#39;s?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1832946663">Thank you for all the great advice.<br/>
It does feel good to know I am not the only one!<br/>
<br/>
I would (at least at this point) not be comfortable taking the kids <br/>
to the service as they have a knack for being really silly and loud <br/>
during any quiet moment. Unfortunately, I found this out during my <br/>
grandfather&#39;s funeral service after running out of a bag of say <br/>
15 &quot;distractions&quot; within 10 minutes  :)<br/>
<br/>
Shy they are not!!!<br/>
<br/>
It seems when I am &quot;distracting&quot; them, I hear very little of what is <br/>
going on around me. And I&#39;m sure I wouldn&#39;t be the only one <br/>
interested in actually hearing, LOL. <br/>
<br/>
The classes for kids as they get older do look really interesting, <br/>
which is what made me think of asking about the &quot;schooling&quot; aspect.<br/>
They have a 2 year overview of many of the worlds major religions <br/>
eventually. The toddler classes do seem to be just crafts, songs, <br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for the responses.<br/>
I think I will try to just suck up my fears and go by myself to <br/>
check it out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1722342130">On the other side of the coin, We go to a UU church<br/>
and I never go to the service--I always go to my 6<br/>
yo&#39;s RE class.  That way she can hang out with friends<br/>
and have fun, but I&#39;m there as a buffer if they ask<br/>
her to sit when she wants to stand, or whatever...I<br/>
think &quot;grown-up&quot; church is majorly boring,<br/>
anyway--it&#39;s much more fun to hang out with 6 yos!<br/>
