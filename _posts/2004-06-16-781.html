<div id="ygrps-yiv-1086864728">Hi I&#39;m Mila<br/>
 I just join this group. I have 3 children, ages<br/>
11yrs. 9yrs. and 7 yrs old.  We&#39;ve been homeschooling<br/>
for 3 years now. And I&#39;m just figuring out what I&#39;m<br/>
doing. I for 2 years brought the classroom into the<br/>
home and it was horrible. It was like pulling teeth<br/>
out for all of us. And it was stressful. Finally I got<br/>
better info and started to really study about<br/>
homeschooling and found out there is so much out<br/>
there. The unschooling approach is more what I&#39;m<br/>
looking for. I&#39;ve let things go finally this year and<br/>
just let the kids lead  me and to my surprise my kids<br/>
have come to me with ideas and we just go from there.<br/>
It feels like we&#39;re actually learning things and<br/>
injoying what we&#39;re learning and nobody is protesting<br/>
anymore. Is this unschooling? My oldest really freaked<br/>
out at first because  she&#39;s used to text books, and my<br/>
teacher says this, or my teacher says that. And I tell<br/>
her I am her teacher and that we&#39;re all learning <br/>
together.  Well it is working. <br/>
 I hope this is the right group to be a part of. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Thanks for reading this, <br/>
  Mila<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1982845313">Hi, Mila!  Nice to meet you here.  I&#39;m Tina, mother to Adrian, 10 yo <br/>
son, that I&#39;ve been homeschooling for a year and a half.  Six months <br/>
of that time we have been unschooling.  Since I have six other <br/>
children, we are a combined family, that are either graduated or <br/>
attend public school life here is interesting to say the least.  <br/>
<br/>
I really enjoy unschooling my son and am finding that it spreads into <br/>
the rest of our lives.  It&#39;s great!  If I could just get everyone <br/>
else on board life would be beautiful.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the group!  I&#39;m sure you will like it here.  This is a <br/>
very friendly, which is VERY important to me, and insightful bunch.  <br/>
There is much to share and learn here everyday.<br/>
<br/>
Take care, and welcome...<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-506562838">Hi  Mila    I have a 10 yr old daughter.  <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve been homeschooling for 3 years;  Great!<br/>
<br/>
I, too started out thinking education should look more traditional  but very quickly learned my son [now 23] did well w unschooling   Too late, my older dd [now almost 30! No say it ain&#39;t so}  would have been a natural independent learner.  <br/>
<br/>
 I love being relaxed and having fun learning huge amounts of history w my youngest.   History through songs is what we like to do.   <br/>
