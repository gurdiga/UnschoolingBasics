<div id="ygrps-yiv-1096215516">Relax. I&#39;ve had nintendo thumb, but nothing like that with the Wii. I think maybe a bit of shoulder pain after a particularly excited bout of bowling, but nothing worse than that. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-828375467">I would suggest relaxing :D<br/>
We&#39;ve had the wii for a year now and no one has injured themselves.  I&#39;ve<br/>
had stiff arms a couple times from Raving Rabbids but that&#39;s about it. My<br/>
boys, who once starting a game keep going persistently until it is done,<br/>
have not had any problems.<br/>
