<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248726682">I usually lurk, but I have an interesting story on the subject of children and BB guns. When my <br/>
husband James was 12 or so (he is 45 now) it seemed to him that all of the children in his <br/>
neighborhood had BB guns, so he wanted one too. His dad always had guns in the house, <br/>
locked in cases, ammo separate, the whole she-bang, however, he said no to a BB gun, <br/>
instead he got his son a .22 caliber rifle. James&#39;s dad said, &quot;You should never point a gun at <br/>
anything unless you are willing to kill it.&quot; He didn&#39;t want his son armed with a weapon that <br/>
*didn&#39;t* kill. I know, it&#39;s counter-intuitive, but I thought that you-all could appreciate the <br/>
thinking.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, James was shot with BB&#39;s by the neighborhood children on a regular basis, and <br/>
suffered no great ills therefrom. His dad showed him how to shoot his .22 safely, and then <br/>
James was trusted to go off and shoot old washing machines at the dump. He never killed a <br/>
bird or a rat, and says that he didn&#39;t do anything that he regrets, even in his secret soul.<br/>
