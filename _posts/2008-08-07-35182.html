<div id="ygrps-yiv-497217795">We love Family Guy and my son just turned 6. He just does not get most of the sexual references but if he asks questions we give him simple answers. <br/>
You probably saw the show last night on Cartoon Network and that one was specially full of sexual innuendo.<br/>
A couple of night before there was a really good one where Peter is very anti-immigrants until he finds out he was born in Mexico and is an illegal immigrant. He goes on to live and illegal immigrants life. It was an awesome show.<br/>
Watch more with them that is my suggestion. Be there to answer questions.<br/>
Have an open mind. Its better your kids see those things with you so you can be there to answer any questions they have ot talk about things they see.<br/>
For us Family Guy is a bonding time between my husband and my son. Even my 2 and a half year old screams: &quot;D&quot; and daddy Family Guy is on&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1072608968">Just spending more time with your child when they&#39;re doing something that<br/>
you don&#39;t personally enjoy can open up for you &quot;why&quot; they like it.  It can<br/>
help you learn more about what your child likes and these can be jumping off<br/>
points for other things to feed the interest they already have.  Karl<br/>
recently started watching stuff with a lot more violence than his dad is<br/>
comfortable with and I pointed out a couple of things that Karl likes about<br/>
those violent shows which I knew would resonate with Brian also.<br/>
<br/>
Find things about interests that aren&#39;t yours so that you are able to relax<br/>
the issue enough and gain a more open communication about that interest.<br/>
Otherwise you risk alienating your child.  The principle is that even though<br/>
your kid&#39;s interests are not your interests, your *kids* are your interest<br/>
and that is why you would want to cultivate your understanding of their<br/>
interests.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a good start right there.<br/>
<br/>
Kids don&#39;t have our baggage about sex topics, so they don&#39;t notice the same<br/>
things about sex although we are surrounded by a culture that mistakenly<br/>
assumes common knowledge about the subject.  On the other hand, don&#39;t<br/>
mistake this to mean that children won&#39;t be sensitive in their *own* way.<br/>
It just isn&#39;t the same sensitivity that *you* have.<br/>
<br/>
So I guess the way we do this around here is pretty much like<br/>
breastfeeding.  When Karl asks or seems to want info, we simply answer the<br/>
question on the face of it and go into no further depth.  All we do is<br/>
answer what is asked.  That way the information we&#39;re giving is not a<br/>
burden.  People don&#39;t generally want to know more, and children are no<br/>
different.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-170088783">I&#39;m not so fond of Family Guy and that&#39;s okay. I&#39;m also not so fond of<br/>
other things that DS and DH enjoy and that&#39;s okay too. And, there are<br/>
things I enjoy that they aren&#39;t fond of (I even like old Murder She<br/>
Wrote and Matlock reruns - I like watching them think). And that&#39;s all<br/>
okay, people have different preferences. Where it becomes a problem is<br/>
when one person&#39;s preferences/opinions take precedence over someone<br/>
else&#39;s. When my dislike of program B means I disparage it to DS and make<br/>
him turn it off whenever it comes on, that&#39;s when it becomes an issue.<br/>
I&#39;ll find something else to do (either in the same room reading a book<br/>
or in another room or whatever), I&#39;m &quot;conversant&quot; with the characters<br/>
and favorite episodes or situations and catch phrases, but that doesn&#39;t<br/>
mean I watch every single episode. I treat DS&#39; enjoyment of various<br/>
programming the same way I treat DH&#39;s enjoyment of programs I dislike<br/>
for various reasons. Oh, and as far as the innuendo and such, DS has<br/>
LOVED 007 movies and videogames since he was 5 - and it wasn&#39;t until he<br/>
was about 8 that he noticed that James Bond &quot;kisses a lot of<br/>
girls&quot;...all the double entendre names and various &quot;situations&quot; just<br/>
went right over his head - he was watching for the gadgets and the<br/>
villains.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-745435758">Okay, so it looks like I may be the only adult here who doesn&#39;t like Family Guy.  Must be time for me to put in my two cents worth. <br/>
<br/>
Anyone who&#39;s been reading here for a couple of years has probably seen my posts about just this topic (South Park, too).  I can&#39;t stand Family Guy -- there aren&#39;t enough adjectives in the English language for me to adequately express my dislike for this show -- but my kids love it.  They watch it.  They DVR it and watch the same episodes over and over and over again... I rarely sit and watch it with them, tho I&#39;m usually nearby and can hear the dialogue.  When I hear something I&#39;d like to comment on, I often say &quot;Do you get why that joke was funny?&quot; which gives me the opening to discuss the context of the joke, the historical aspects, and how it relate to current issues.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Family Guy and South Park (Simpsons, too, but I like them) we&#39;ve talked about all kinds of things that otherwise may not have come up in day to day conversation. The topics parents are told they &#39;must&#39; talk about with their kids -- sex, drug, morals -- become just part of life instead of being heavily weighted sit-down conversations (lectures) with kids.  So, altho I really can&#39;t stand Family Guy, I defend my kids&#39; right to watch it -- have to from time to time with my husband, who is even more offended by those shows than I am.  So much so that he can&#39;t see any value in them at all, but he trusts me on this one.  He just has to leave the room.  <br/>
<br/>
And I think it&#39;s perfectly okay for your kids to know you don&#39;t like a particular show, or book or whatever.  We all have different tastes and opinions.  Just because I don&#39;t like a TV show doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s forbidden to them.  I have interests and passions my kids don&#39;t share, and likely never will.  Different strokes for different folks. <br/>
<br/>
All that said, we&#39;ve asked them not to watch FG, SouthPark, or even The Simpsons when we&#39;re visiting the in-laws. It&#39;s just not worth the discomfort for others, which allows even more discussion about consideration for others, and why their grandparents feel as they do about the influences of TV on kids. They agreed that watching those shows when we visit grandparents or aunties (we&#39;ll be visiting both in CA in 3 wks) would just be more trouble than it&#39;s worth.  We just DVR what they&#39;ll miss while we&#39;re gone and they can have a Family Guy/South Park Marathon when we get home.  No big deal.<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
(Ren)<br/>
<br/>
Sexual innuendos are only a problem if someone is uncomfortable with sex as a topic. I think it&#39;s one of the best shows for making connections to tons of cultural references and musicals. <br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
Ren, you know I love ya, but I have to disagree here.  I am very comfortable with sex as a topic. Sometimes too comfortable. &lt;g&gt;  I can talk about with kids, friends, nursing Moms I just met. I&#39;ve talked about sex one-on-one and in groups, in private settings and not-so-private setting.  However, I don&#39;t find any of the sex talk on Family Guy to be funny, or anything other than offensive and ugly.  My reaction is deeply visceral, but I can move above that and manage to parlay that awful stuff into conversations about sex and relationships, history and culture, because I think it&#39;s essential that our kids be aware of the connotations of sex in our culture.  <br/>
<br/>
I agree the cultural references are great, downright invaluable in exposing and explaining so much about our world.  I seldom get the musical references (because I simply can&#39;t stand musicals), but I&#39;ve noticed that whenever Will&#39;s girlfriend is over she explains, for example, that a reference to &quot;pirates in pants&quot;  comes from Pirates of Penzance.  Then again, she is Music Theory major who sings opera, so that aspect of entertainment is her forte.<br/>
<br/>
And, hey, if you really want your boundaries stretched on this topic, buy your kids a copy of Grand Theft Auto!  So many opportunites to stretch and grow. &lt;g&gt;  I am having conversations about things I never thought I&#39;d discuss with a 12yo boy, much less a 7yo boy. <br/>

off- and the 5 yr old said- ya but not her underwear- so even though it<br/>
was a 5 sec sex sense they did not see sex<br/>
<br/>
sex is all around us and yet we are supposed to pretend that there is no<br/>
such thing- I notice a lot of adult comments in a lot of kid shows but<br/>
the kids are not getting it like the adults are and by watching these<br/>
out there shows it opens discussions<br/>
<br/>
you could ask your kids what they think about the show and what they<br/>
like about it- they are prabably not seeing or hearing what you are-<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-264609950">I understand your concern about your kids watching Family Guy.  I have<br/>
had a hard time dealing with it as well.  My hubby and I really like<br/>
the show but I feel like we can&#39;t watch it b/c dd(5yrs) will<br/>
inevitably come into the room and we will have to change the channel.<br/>
 I hate trying to distract her so that I can watch tv with out her. <br/>
It just doesn&#39;t feel right.  <br/>
Sounds like I have been looking at our situation totally backwards. <br/>
Instead of shielding her from these topics, I am going to make an<br/>
effort to be more open with her about discussing everything.  Sounds<br/>
so obvious, but somehow I just got off track.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-628594714">I don&#39;t like it either. But the kids do and watch it sometimes. There aren&#39;t any deep ideas explored in Family Guy, that I&#39;ve noticed, though. Nothing that should change anyone&#39;s worldview or deeply-held principles. But the kids get to see that I don&#39;t watch it and I am free to say I think it is dumb and they can take that for what it&#39;s worth. <br/>
<br/>
And mix that with everything else and come up with their own ideas.<br/>

pass on commentary about what you disagree about it. The answer is:  <br/>
don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Answer their questions. Make connections. Ask them what they enjoy  <br/>
about it. Enjoy their enjoyment. Don&#39;t watch it with a closed mind.<br/>
<br/>
Truthfully, the best discussions have come up as I *share* my  <br/>
daughter&#39;s interests not tell her what I don&#39;t like about them. She&#39;s  <br/>
into 80s heavy metal and there was certainly plenty of behavior that  <br/>
went on with those groups that could be negatively commented on as I  <br/>
try to get *my* message into her. But it works out *much* better to  <br/>
trust that she is a thinking human being growing up with good values  <br/>
and that she can make good comparisons and judgments.<br/>

it comes up naturally. Make yourself stay calm and centered and  <br/>

<br/>
Roya (now 23) was maybe 5 - her dad and I were sitting in chairs and  <br/>
she was playing with some cards on the floor at our feet. She looked  <br/>
up and asked me, &quot;How does the baby get inside the mommy?&quot; I sensed my  <br/>
husband sort of flinching, over to my right, but I spoke right up and  <br/>
said, &quot;The baby grows inside there.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well - Roya kept asking more questions and I just kept answering them,  <br/>
calmly and with a little amusement (although not showing it other than  <br/>
showing some good-natured enjoyment of the conversation. By the time  <br/>
were done, we&#39;d gotten to the point of me saying something like, &quot;Yes,  <br/>
the man puts his penis into her vagina and the sperm is squirted out  <br/>
of the penis and swims up the tubes.&quot; I mean - that much detail is  <br/>
what she was asking for.<br/>
<br/>
So - there&#39;s a pause.<br/>
Roya gets up off the floor and starts to walk across out of the room,  <br/>
but turns back and begins to laugh. Her laugh is infectious and we  <br/>
feel a release of tension in it and we laugh a little too. Then she  <br/>
says, &quot;You are SO funny. I suppose next you&#39;re going to tell me they  <br/>
take their clothes off, too.&quot; I say, &quot;Well, yeah.&quot; But I&#39;m laughing.  <br/>
She doesn&#39;t BELIEVE me and says, &quot;Yeah, right. You just made that ALL  <br/>
up. HA HA HA.&quot; And laughs harder. Of course, my husband and I are  <br/>
laughing so hard we&#39;re almost crying by now, but all our laughing  <br/>
while say, &quot;No it is true. Really,&quot; is just convincing her even more  <br/>
so that I just made up that entire big story.<br/>
<br/>
The other kids have never been that persistent, much more reserved  <br/>
about the whole thing. But tv shows like Family Guy have been great  <br/>
for lots and lots of little opportunities to clear up some  <br/>
misperception or talk about the possible consequences of different  <br/>
choices, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I think one or more of my kids once said to a group of unschoolers  <br/>
that their parents never really talked to them about sex. But, it  <br/>
isn&#39;t true. We never had a BIG talk, but it has come up a million  <br/>
times in just momentary and natural ways.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1443380137">Oof, your e-mail feels so harsh.  I didn&#39;t like Family Guy at first. Quagmire bugged me, he still does a bit. But watching Family Guy with Simon and Linnaea and David, oh, David&#39;s face splits in two he laughs so hard, I get it. And they love giggity, giggity, goo. Between a few friends of theirs and them it is a big joke. It is waning, but it was the funniest thing for a long time. I really love being able to decide that I want to find out what they like in something. Y&#39;know, sit and watch and pay attention and watch what gets them laughing or responding the most, and be there to talk about the huge number of cultural references that are going on in any episode, or whatever other conversation spins off from watching the episode. <br/>
<br/>
I would feel awful if I dismissed something that my children liked with the comment that my lack of interest hadn&#39;t stopped the world from spinning. There have been some pretty powerful things that have occured and the world just keeps spinning. I don&#39;t know that it is a particularly reliable gauge of the effect your dismissal of something they like may have on your relationship with them. <br/>
<br/>
It is actually a very thoughtful show. That doesn&#39;t mean you have to like it or not think it is dumb. There is a show where Seth McFarlane, the creator, interviews people who hate Family Guy. They don&#39;t know who he is. It is wonderfully funny. I can&#39;t find it on-line. Maybe it was on only in the UK. It was brilliant. <br/>

I don&#39;t like it either. But the kids do and watch it sometimes. There aren&#39;t any deep ideas explored in Family Guy, that I&#39;ve noticed, though. Nothing that should change anyone&#39;s worldview or deeply-held principles.

I just watched this for the first time last night. My kids who are 10 and 6<br/>
have seen it several times before. I personally do not like the show. I<br/>
think it is lewd, crude, and full of sexual innuendos. I know that I have<br/>
sheltered my kids a fair amount in the past. Now that they can watch<br/>
whatever, what are some ways to talk with them about the show? I also think<br/>
that my oldest especially can tell that I didn&#39;t like the show. Any ideas?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1633622063">I hate Family Guy (the dad is a moron and honestly stupidity is like a pet<br/>
peeve to me) but my DH, DS 8, and DD 3 love it. My DD you can tell mostly<br/>
doesn&#39;t get it and only laughs cause DH does. I like South Park mostly<br/>
because the language is bleeped and the bleeps make me laugh. they also make<br/>
fun of other movies much like Robot Chicken which I also think is partially<br/>
funny. I have only ever asked my family not watch those shows when there is<br/>
another child over who&#39;s parents would not be happy about them watching. The<br/>
shows have opened up a lot of conversations.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
As for the sex part, we have two levels in our household. There is the<br/>
clinical mating side of it and there is the sexism - would you want to hear<br/>
or hear your child repeat such things? There is a reason why the sexist<br/>
character doesn&#39;t talk clearly. My son through trial and error and short<br/>
conversations has learned there are things we watch and hear which we laugh<br/>
at that might offend people if they heard it in normal conversation.<br/>

Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Family Guy<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Okay, so it looks like I may be the only adult here who doesn&#39;t like Family<br/>
Guy.  Must be time for me to put in my two cents worth. <br/>
<br/>
Anyone who&#39;s been reading here for a couple of years has probably seen my<br/>
posts about just this topic (South Park, too).  I can&#39;t stand Family Guy --<br/>
there aren&#39;t enough adjectives in the English language for me to adequately<br/>
express my dislike for this show -- but my kids love it.  They watch it.<br/>
They DVR it and watch the same episodes over and over and over again... I<br/>
rarely sit and watch it with them, tho I&#39;m usually nearby and can hear the<br/>
dialogue.  When I hear something I&#39;d like to comment on, I often say &quot;Do you<br/>
get why that joke was funny?&quot; which gives me the opening to discuss the<br/>
context of the joke, the historical aspects, and how it relate to current<br/>
issues.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Family Guy and South Park (Simpsons, too, but I like them) we&#39;ve<br/>
talked about all kinds of things that otherwise may not have come up in day<br/>
to day conversation. The topics parents are told they &#39;must&#39; talk about with<br/>
their kids -- sex, drug, morals -- become just part of life instead of being<br/>
heavily weighted sit-down conversations (lectures) with kids.  So, altho I<br/>
really can&#39;t stand Family Guy, I defend my kids&#39; right to watch it -- have<br/>
to from time to time with my husband, who is even more offended by those<br/>
shows than I am.  So much so that he can&#39;t see any value in them at all, but<br/>
he trusts me on this one.  He just has to leave the room.  <br/>
<br/>
And I think it&#39;s perfectly okay for your kids to know you don&#39;t like a<br/>
particular show, or book or whatever.  We all have different tastes and<br/>
opinions.  Just because I don&#39;t like a TV show doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s forbidden<br/>
to them.  I have interests and passions my kids don&#39;t share, and likely<br/>
never will.  Different strokes for different folks. <br/>
<br/>
All that said, we&#39;ve asked them not to watch FG, SouthPark, or even The<br/>
Simpsons when we&#39;re visiting the in-laws. It&#39;s just not worth the discomfort<br/>
for others, which allows even more discussion about consideration for<br/>
others, and why their grandparents feel as they do about the influences of<br/>
TV on kids. They agreed that watching those shows when we visit grandparents<br/>
or aunties (we&#39;ll be visiting both in CA in 3 wks) would just be more<br/>
trouble than it&#39;s worth.  We just DVR what they&#39;ll miss while we&#39;re gone and<br/>
they can have a Family Guy/South Park Marathon when we get home.  No big<br/>
deal.<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
(Ren)<br/>
<br/>
Sexual innuendos are only a problem if someone is uncomfortable with sex as<br/>
a topic. I think it&#39;s one of the best shows for making connections to tons<br/>
of cultural references and musicals. <br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
Ren, you know I love ya, but I have to disagree here.  I am very comfortable<br/>
with sex as a topic. Sometimes too comfortable. &lt;g&gt;  I can talk about with<br/>
kids, friends, nursing Moms I just met. I&#39;ve talked about sex one-on-one and<br/>
in groups, in private settings and not-so-private setting.  However, I don&#39;t<br/>
find any of the sex talk on Family Guy to be funny, or anything other than<br/>
offensive and ugly.  My reaction is deeply visceral, but I can move above<br/>
that and manage to parlay that awful stuff into conversations about sex and<br/>
relationships, history and culture, because I think it&#39;s essential that our<br/>
kids be aware of the connotations of sex in our culture.  <br/>
<br/>
I agree the cultural references are great, downright invaluable in exposing<br/>
and explaining so much about our world.  I seldom get the musical references<br/>
(because I simply can&#39;t stand musicals), but I&#39;ve noticed that whenever<br/>
Will&#39;s girlfriend is over she explains, for example, that a reference to<br/>
&quot;pirates in pants&quot;  comes from Pirates of Penzance.  Then again, she is<br/>
Music Theory major who sings opera, so that aspect of entertainment is her<br/>
forte.<br/>
<br/>
And, hey, if you really want your boundaries stretched on this topic, buy<br/>
your kids a copy of Grand Theft Auto!  So many opportunites to stretch and<br/>
grow. &lt;g&gt;  I am having conversations about things I never thought I&#39;d<br/>
discuss with a 12yo boy, much less a 7yo boy. <br/>

I have seen some deep ideas explored on Family Guy, and when that&#39;s<br/>
what my kids are watching, I feel compelled to give them some context<br/>
on the statement being made.  That&#39;s been the part that makes it hard<br/>
for me -- I can see that the writers on that show are very aware of<br/>
bigger, deeper issues and wish they&#39;d find some less unattractive (to<br/>
me) way to tackle them.  But I feel that way about a lot of issues, so<br/>
maybe I&#39;m the weird one. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No matter how much I dislike something, or how stupid I genuinely feel<br/>
it is, I don&#39;t have the right to say that to my kids.  I can say I<br/>
find it offensive, that it&#39;s not my kind of humor.  <br/>
<br/>
Would you be okay if one of your children routinely told the other<br/>
that his favorite toy is dumb?  If it&#39;s not okay for my kids to say<br/>
something to each other, then it&#39;s not okay for me to say it to one of<br/>
them, either.<br/>

Archie Bunker freaked a LOT of mainstream society out completely. <br/>
Carroll O&#39;Connor got hate mail. Do you remember the flushing toilet???<br/>
<br/>
Now he&#39;s an icon. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh---and THAT Family Guy reference to All in the Family is clear as a <br/>
bell! With Lois and Peter singing at the beginning.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe most of you are too young to remember the vitriolic letters to <br/>
the editor back in the 70s. People HATED All in the Family.<br/>
<br/>
This is from Wikipedia about All in the Family. A lot of it could refer <br/>
to 21st century Family Guy as well.<br/>
<br/>
******************<br/>
In a warning to viewers, CBS ran a disclaimer before airing the first <br/>
episode (which disappeared from the screen with the sound of a toilet <br/>
flushing):<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The program you are about to see is All in the Family. It seeks to <br/>
throw a humorous spotlight on our frailties, prejudices, and concerns. <br/>
By making them a source of laughter we hope to show, in a mature <br/>
fashion, just how absurd they are.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
All in the Family was notorious for featuring language and epithets <br/>
previously absent from television, such as &quot;fag&quot; for homosexual, &quot;hebe&quot; <br/>
for Jews, &quot;spic&quot; for Hispanics, &quot;dago&quot; and &quot;wop&quot; for Italians, &quot;chink&quot; <br/>
for Asians, &quot;spade&quot; for Blacks, and phrases such as &quot;God damn it.&quot; It <br/>
was also famous for being the first major television show to feature <br/>
the sound of a flushing toilet; it became a running gag on the show.<br/>
<br/>
While moral watchdogs attacked the show on those grounds, others <br/>
objected to the show&#39;s portrayal of Archie Bunker as a &quot;lovable&quot; bigot. <br/>
Defenders of the series pointed out that Archie usually lost his <br/>
arguments by reason of his own stupidity.<br/>
**********************<br/>
<br/>

Ok so how can you get more comfortable with sex as a topic?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm...watch more Family Guy? &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Seriously----it&#39;s an open invitation to talk about all SORTS of sexual <br/>
issues (and racial, financial, and societal---and familial issues too!).<br/>
<br/>
A lot of what happens/is said in Family Guy really goes right over 12 <br/>
year old Duncan&#39;s head. Some things he laughs at just because *we* do <br/>
or because the laugh track says, &quot;Laugh NOW!&quot; But a lot of it gets <br/>
questioned. He&#39;s not shy about asking! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Family Guy, Futurama, South Park, The Simpsons, and American Dad (my <br/>
least favorite) can lead to ALL open season on sex and all sorts of <br/>
social issues.<br/>
<br/>
When answering questions (and watching the shows with them), try really <br/>
hard not to *look* flustered or embarrassed or confused. &lt;g&gt; Just SAY <br/>
it. Laughing about it really helps. If you get angry or turned off, <br/>
they don&#39;t necessarily know *what* you&#39;re angry about. If we can laugh <br/>
and enjoy it, it&#39;s easier to chat about. Clamming up about something <br/>
they enjoy makes them clam up.<br/>
<br/>
Simply waiting for children to bring it up may result in its never <br/>
happening. If it doesn&#39;t come naturally to the parents, the parents <br/>
need to make an environment which IS natural. Family Guy can get you in <br/>
that environment by remote control. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Use it. Abuse it. Make it yours! &lt;G&gt; OWN those shows. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-===-<br/>
<br/>
Sex was definitely not talked about around my house when I was growing <br/>
up but I<br/>
wanted to do things differently as a parent. We are comfortable with the<br/>
human body in our family.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well, that&#39;s a good start. The good thing about these shows is that <br/>
they open the doors. For REAL discussion. Not lectures or sermons.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-67445671">I love most of those shows. My mother hated All in the Family but it was one of daddy&#39;s favorites so we all watched it. The Simpsons, Southpark, etc all of them have some merit if nothing else to open the floor to conversation and quite a bit of laughter. As for sex being taboo discussion, I can sympathize. My mother was very conservative and my father was not. So I did have an outlet. My husband and I also decided years ago that we wanted our children to be able to talk to either one of us about anything. So we have simply told them to ask what ever questions they have on any topic and we will answer them to the best of our ability. My daughter is comfortable talking to her daddy about growing up and hopefully my son will be as comfortable with me when he begins getting older.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the discussions we have had over these shows have been quite interesting and insightful. I honestly love to sit back and look at the world as brand new through the eyes of our children. They aren&#39;t jaded or cynical from life yet. <br/>

People used to put down All in the Family. I remember my mom saying <br/>
that<br/>
the show had no redeeming qualities. After twenty years it has become<br/>
a classic, and more people are open to reading what the original<br/>
writers were thinking behind the shows. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-854096322">My parents wouldn&#39;t let us watch All in the Family, and of course little ole<br/>
me wanted to because I&#39;m like... &quot;why not!?&quot;  Reactions against Family Guy<br/>
can yield the same results.<br/>
<br/>
The reason people react is precisely because the issues are pervasively ugly<br/>
and they&#39;re pervasive in our culture and people get comfortable with it<br/>
which only serves to make it sit right at home wherever it appears.  And<br/>
then along comes a show to point out the ridiculous level of acceptance<br/>
of ridiculous unacceptable stuff.  That shakes us up, especially if we&#39;ve<br/>
become adept at ignoring the issues and whatever it is that we can do to<br/>
stop it which we&#39;re *not* doing because we don&#39;t want to take part in<br/>
solving problems that we don&#39;t feel we&#39;re to blame for.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s social activism in a format which is meant to appeal to the intellect<br/>
and the finer side as it reveals the not so fine side in our culture.<br/>

&gt; I disagree that deep ideas are not explored. I don&#39;t enjoy watching<br/>
&gt; the show either, however, I don&#39;t like most primetime shows. I do<br/>
&gt; watch it with the kids though, so we can talk about what comes uup.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Duncan LOVES Family Guy. Cameron winces at the sexism. Ben says, &quot;It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; raw, nasty humor that I just love.&quot; (that&#39;s a quote)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think it&#39;s funny, but painful, sometimes. It pokes its fingers at<br/>
&gt; sooo many different aspects of American life that *are* ugly and<br/>
&gt; sordid---and what did the OP write?Lewd, crude, rude, and filled with<br/>
&gt; sexual innuendo (Not all of it&#39;s &quot;innuendo&quot; ---- a LOT is right out<br/>
&gt; there, blatant, and obvious! &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll change Melissa&#39;s quote a bit:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; People used to put down All in the Family. I remember my mom saying<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; the show had no redeeming qualities. After twenty years it has become<br/>
&gt; a classic, and more people are open to reading what the original<br/>
&gt; writers were thinking behind the shows. I think Family Guy is like<br/>
&gt; All in the Family in that they address a lot of social issues in ways<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; are meaning to SOME people. Yes, they&#39;re vulgar and many people<br/>
&gt; cringe...but that shouldn&#39;t dismiss all of the topics they do touch<br/>
&gt; on...drinking, sexism, ageism, ableism...the list goes on. &lt;snip&gt; They<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; parody societal norms to such an extreme that perhaps someone who<br/>
&gt; appreciates subtle humor would no longer be amused. But it&#39;s not fair<br/>
&gt; to say that there aren&#39;t deep ideas to be explored, there have been<br/>
&gt; lots of things that have opened the eyes of my children to<br/>
&gt; expectations based on sex or race or ability.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ************<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Archie Bunker freaked a LOT of mainstream society out completely.<br/>
&gt; Carroll O&#39;Connor got hate mail. Do you remember the flushing toilet???<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now he&#39;s an icon. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh---and THAT Family Guy reference to All in the Family is clear as a<br/>
&gt; bell! With Lois and Peter singing at the beginning.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Maybe most of you are too young to remember the vitriolic letters to<br/>
&gt; the editor back in the 70s. People HATED All in the Family.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is from Wikipedia about All in the Family. A lot of it could refer<br/>
&gt; to 21st century Family Guy as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ******************<br/>
&gt; In a warning to viewers, CBS ran a disclaimer before airing the first<br/>
&gt; episode (which disappeared from the screen with the sound of a toilet<br/>
&gt; flushing):<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;The program you are about to see is All in the Family. It seeks to<br/>
&gt; throw a humorous spotlight on our frailties, prejudices, and concerns.<br/>
&gt; By making them a source of laughter we hope to show, in a mature<br/>
&gt; fashion, just how absurd they are.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; All in the Family was notorious for featuring language and epithets<br/>
&gt; previously absent from television, such as &quot;fag&quot; for homosexual, &quot;hebe&quot;<br/>
&gt; for Jews, &quot;spic&quot; for Hispanics, &quot;dago&quot; and &quot;wop&quot; for Italians, &quot;chink&quot;<br/>
&gt; for Asians, &quot;spade&quot; for Blacks, and phrases such as &quot;God damn it.&quot; It<br/>
&gt; was also famous for being the first major television show to feature<br/>
&gt; the sound of a flushing toilet; it became a running gag on the show.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; While moral watchdogs attacked the show on those grounds, others<br/>
&gt; objected to the show&#39;s portrayal of Archie Bunker as a &quot;lovable&quot; bigot.<br/>
&gt; Defenders of the series pointed out that Archie usually lost his<br/>
&gt; arguments by reason of his own stupidity.<br/>

your own home to &quot;own&quot; your own mind and consider someone else&#39;s<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-669939199">My husband is a huge, huge Family Guy fan.  I like it, but sometimes a joke goes on too long and I get annoyed.  It is fun for us to watch it together because there is always something one of us misses and it is fun to talk about it.  I love the musical and movie references.<br/>
<br/>
Megan (7) has seen the show, but she doesn&#39;t like the violence/weird images that pop up sometimes (she has the same issues with The Simpsons and Futurama).  So we don&#39;t watch it around her.<br/>
<br/>
She really wanted to try Robot Chicken the other night.  The opening sequence freaked her out a little and she asked that I cover her eyes if anything she didn&#39;t like was going to happen.  I don&#39;t know if she&#39;ll want to watch it again, but it was fun to watch it with her and try to explain why dh and I were laughing so hard.<br/>

<br/>
You don&#39;t have to like everything they like.<br/>
<br/>
It helps, but it&#39;s not mandatory (good thing---&#39;cause I can&#39;t sit <br/>
through much Jazz &lt;G&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
Support is good. Good-natured support is better.<br/>
<br/>
Try to sit through a few more episodes. It may grow on you---but it may <br/>
not. But their seeing you *try* to like it ain&#39;t a bad thing. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some episodes are worse than others. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you can wear earphones and listen to music and knit while they <br/>
watch, you can answer questions they may have. Ain&#39;t TiVo grand? Just <br/>
back it up to get the joke.<br/>
<br/>
Just watching them in hysterics should be good enough, huh? &lt;G&gt;<br/>

watched part of it and had to turn it off because she was so frightened. We  <br/>
co-sleep so I am there for her all night but it is still REALLY scary to her. I  <br/>
cannot imagine watching CSI w/ her or something like that. She went through a <br/>
 phase where she got so upset if she saw a drop of blood on her - worrying if <br/>
she  would heal or fall apart. <br/>

Once we happened on a commercial on Bravo for that workout reality show  <br/>
where two women were kissing - after that she tried to kiss me w/  <br/>

think it is lewd, crude, and full of sexual innuendos. I know that I have<br/>
sheltered my kids a fair amount in the past. Now that they can watch<br/>
whatever, what are some ways to talk with them about the show? I also think<br/>
that my oldest especially can tell that I didn&#39;t like the show. Any ideas?<br/>
