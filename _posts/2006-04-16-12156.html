<div id="ygrps-yiv-256099933">Hello!<br/>
I began homeschooling a little over a year ago and am really enjoying<br/>
the process.  I am most drawn to unschooling and yet we are not &quot;there<br/>
yet&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
I have found a confusing bit of inconsistency, though, that I could<br/>
really use some help with.<br/>
<br/>
As I understand it, any parent-initiated teaching means it is NOT<br/>
unschooling... yet I meet so many people who follow John Holt (and<br/>
other&#39;s) and are &quot;unschooly&quot; but that do initiate instruction (like<br/>
me) but I have only found one term to describe this option... relaxed<br/>
homeschooler.  <br/>
<br/>
Can anyone shed any light on this for me?  I haven&#39;t found any sites<br/>
or anything..  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks very much for your thoughts!<br/>
Cynthia</div>

<br/>
Asking yourself if you&#39;d do it to your husband or friend can help.  <br/>
Though not with everything since our kids have less access to the  <br/>
world. They can&#39;t read through the paper and order tickets to a show  <br/>
that sounds interesting ;-)<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s lots of the world they can&#39;t know they like unless we expose  <br/>
it to them. But we should be exposing them to things we think they&#39;d  <br/>
like rather than things we think are good for them. We only get a few  <br/>
misses on &quot;Trust me, you&#39;ll like it&quot; before they realize they can&#39;t  <br/>
trust us ;-) So we need to choose wisely.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think in terms of teaching. I think in terms of exposing her  <br/>
to things she might enjoy.<br/>

Can you elaborate on what *you* consider &quot;initiate instruction&quot; to mean?<br/>
<br/>
Do you mean teach?<br/>
<br/>
share? engage? find? buy?<br/>
<br/>
Help me know where you&#39;re coming from. Examples....<br/>
