<div id="ygrps-yiv-887835315">Hi, Ren.  Thank you for editing that sarcastic remark, what ever it <br/>
was.  <br/>
<br/>
One thing that I would like to add to this discussion is that our <br/>
family has only had a television for one year.  We as Christians <br/>
used to really believe that we, as parents, needed to protect our <br/>
kids from the outside world.  So, my husband and I got rid of our <br/>
television before our first son was even born.  We saw the serious <br/>
error in our thinking and purchased a television just under a year <br/>
ago.  When we first got it, I controlled what was watched all the <br/>
time.  I was also convinced that it would have an affect on their <br/>
behavior so I monitored that as well. Guess what?  It did not.  They <br/>
were still as energetic as before!  After a year of television, 3 <br/>
months of that no control on what is watched at all, (due to <br/>
unschooling) they are still as energetic, not comatose and still <br/>
bouncing off the walls (o.k. the couches)  The only affect it has <br/>
had is positive.  They are learning new things all the time and <br/>
questioning much of what they hear.  I constantly hear,&quot;Mom, is that <br/>
true?&quot; and I will have them research it on the net.  (My 5 and 6 <br/>
year olds are readers).  So, as for us, we will be keeping our <br/>
television and using it as another tool in their journey to be life <br/>
long learners.<br/>
<br/>
Again, thank you for letting me share in this discussion.  <br/>
<br/>
Maria  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-575459328">Hi Maria<br/>
<br/>
My kids bounce whilst watching T.V. The sofa takes a beating but they are never still.  As a child my parents - also Christians - did not have a T.V. I feel maybe it didn&#39;t matter so much then  ( childrens T.V was a bit staid and they Anthem came on every night at a certain time, then the little dot lol)but nowadays the T.V is great for learning all sorts of things.  They often tell me stuff and say they saw if on such and  such a programme.  <br/>
