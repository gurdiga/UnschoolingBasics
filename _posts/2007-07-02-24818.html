<div id="ygrps-yiv-1385187438">We are having a bit of a problem with ds (age 5) not listening when someone tells him to <br/>
stop doing whatever it is he is doing to them.  It seems to be getting worse and dh and I <br/>
are just at a loss as to how to handle these situations.  <br/>
<br/>
For instance yesterday while at my mom&#39;s house his three cousins were there and just <br/>
about every 5 minutes someone was telling him to please stop doing what he was doing <br/>
and he would just laugh and continue.  One example was when his cousin (also age 5) was <br/>
playing his gameboy and ds was watching him, then for some reason ds kept smacking <br/>
the gameboy while his cousin was playing it which was obviously upsetting to the cousin.  <br/>
Ds also had his gameboy there, but didn&#39;t want to play it.  When this happened I came over <br/>
and said &quot;Hayden asked you to stop hitting his gameboy, when someone says stop you <br/>
need to stop right now&quot;, he just laughed and did it again.  When this happens I feel I have <br/>
no alternative but to remove him from the situation, which he is totally opposed to, <br/>
kicking and yelling and saying to me &quot;your stupid!&quot;, &quot;I&#39;m not going to listen to you!&quot;.  He <br/>
has never been punished, but obviously the loss of autonomy sets him off.  All I try to do <br/>
is talk to him in as few words as possible why he needs to stop when someone tells him to <br/>
stop, but he doesn&#39;t want to hear it.  When this happens all he wants to do is run back and  <br/>
continue with what he was doing, he isn&#39;t in the mindframe for having a conversation, so <br/>
in the end it just makes things worse and doesn&#39;t help, but I also feel that it&#39;s not an <br/>
option for him to continue with what he was doing, what are the alternatives? <br/>
<br/>
He will also hit toys out of kids hands if it is something he wants to play with.  I try to <br/>
empathize with him about how much he wants the toy and when the child is done with it <br/>
then he can play with it, but he will just continute to chase the kid around trying to hit it <br/>
out of their hands (he did this with his 2 year old cousin yesterday). Again I feel like I have <br/>
to physically stop him because the other child was being hurt.  Some of the same <br/>
behaviors happen here at home with his little brother (20 months), but it&#39;s easier to just <br/>
re-direct him or talk to him because we don&#39;t have to physically remove him.  Sometimes <br/>
we just pick up the 20 month old and move him somewhere else.  <br/>
<br/>
For the most part he seems to listen to kids older than him, but not kids younger than him <br/>
that he can &quot;overpower&quot;.  Him and his cousin who is 7 seemed to get along fine, but he <br/>
was constantly doing things to the 5 year old and 2 year old.  Not sure why this is.  Also <br/>
when we have the neighbor kids over he gets along fine with the older ones, but him and <br/>
the 4 year old next door seem to always have problems?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

stuff from him (since you already know this about him) and be <br/>
prepared with distractions.  Telling him to stop is probably about as <br/>
effective as asking Niagara Falls to stop flowing.  He is clearly not <br/>
ready to be with littler kids than he is.  Could be that he&#39;s feeling <br/>
generally inferior to other older kids (just guessing now, I have no <br/>
way of knowing if this could be true or not) so he lords it over the <br/>
littler ones.  Thing is, you can&#39;t reason with him about that.<br/>
<br/>
I believe you *can* prevent it though, by being very, very present <br/>
with him (not in the next room or within earshot) when he&#39;s with <br/>
smaller kids and anticipating his behavior, and then being ready to <br/>
redirect him *before* he starts getting weird.  And, redirecting <br/>
should be with something he *really* likes, not something he&#39;ll <br/>
resist.  Perhaps you *can* talk with him about this, though, when <br/>
he&#39;s not in the situation, but I&#39;m not even sure I&#39;d do this with him <br/>
yet.  Five years old is really, really little and young; I think I <br/>
would move more toward being the way you want him to be (one of my <br/>
favorite quotes is, &quot;You must be what you want your children to <br/>
become&quot;) and pointing out when others are kind towards him.  Also, <br/>
when you and he witness bullying behavior on TV or in a story, talk <br/>
about it what&#39;s uncool about it.<br/>
<br/>
I believe he&#39;ll get it eventually with your loving support.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that helps a little.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-845355962">~~which he is totally opposed to, kicking and yelling and saying to me<br/>
&quot;your stupid!&quot;, &quot;I&#39;m not going to listen to you!&quot;. He has never been<br/>
punished, but obviously the loss of autonomy sets him off. ~~<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
First of all, let me empathize!:) I have a small man that has had many<br/>
similar behaviors in those situations and it can tax your mommy<br/>
gentleness to the core. But hang in there, it does get better and they<br/>
learn new tools every year. Jalen is 6.5 now and our lives are<br/>
changing drastically as far as new friendships and outings.<br/>
<br/>
What worked for us? Limiting contact with younger kids. It sounds<br/>
drastic, but he really just couldn&#39;t handle much of that kind of<br/>
stimulation. He was happy with a group of teens or older kids, but<br/>
anyone his age or younger was a disaster for a long time. <br/>
<br/>
This last 6 months has been huge for us. We can go to park days with<br/>
our homeschool group and I don&#39;t follow him around every second. He<br/>
interacts with other kids and doesn&#39;t melt down or get angry. For the<br/>
first year we lived here, I pretty much followed him wherever he<br/>
wanted to go (and it was usually away from the group) or pushed him on<br/>
the swing while the other kids played with our group.<br/>
<br/>
I know it can be very difficult to find ways to limit what distresses<br/>
him, but sometimes it&#39;s necessary for his own peace and your ability<br/>
to stay connected. I found that when we did need to be with a group<br/>
(for the other children&#39;s sake) I had to prepare myself to simply BE<br/>
with Jalen. It&#39;s hard to be &quot;on&quot; all the time, but that&#39;s just what<br/>
they need. <br/>
<br/>
Make sure he has his own hand-held game system if possible. Show him<br/>
ways to connect with the other children through the game (you may have<br/>
to sit right there the entire time) and work at prevention. There are<br/>
times I used distraction &quot;hey Jalen, want to help me mix the cake?&quot;<br/>
but once he was in that intense zone, there was little to do but<br/>
remove him at times. <br/>
<br/>
We used Rescue Remedy. We cuddled. We talked about what the other kids<br/>
expected and how to help him get what he wanted. We empathized. We<br/>
took walks and went on the swing. We dug in the dirt and jumped on the<br/>
trampoline. In short, we tried to meet him where he was.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t tell you how many times I sat in a back bedroom while he raged<br/>
for a while. These rages got less and less as he got older. His<br/>
&quot;rages&quot; lately have been a simple expression of anger and a<br/>
short-lived outburst that resolves itself in about 5 minutes. What a<br/>
change from even a year ago!<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;ve realized with Jalen, is that removal from the situation FELT<br/>
like punishment to him. While I was only trying to protect the other<br/>
children (and believe me, they needed protection) it felt like a total<br/>
intrusion of his freedom to him. I&#39;m sad for that. But at the same<br/>
time, he&#39;s learned (through time and his own development) that I<br/>
really didn&#39;t want to stop him from doing what he wanted, I only<br/>
needed him to give the other kids space (he has very little concept of<br/>
personal boundaries).  This could only happen in it&#39;s own time. There<br/>
is no way to &quot;teach&quot; this to anyone....you just love them up and wait.:)<br/>
<br/>
This doesn&#39;t work in every situation or for every child, but at this<br/>
point with Jalen (when he&#39;s in the middle of being intense and unable<br/>
to acknowledge a person yelling &quot;STOP now&quot;) I can pick him up and kiss<br/>
his cheek, telling him &quot;I love you&quot; while redirecting his energy. That<br/>
sweet connection really works for us now. <br/>
<br/>
While I&#39;m giving him that hug or kiss, I can then say &quot; I really need<br/>
you to hear me right now&quot;  or &quot;I really need you to come out here with<br/>
me for just a minute&quot; to give some space to the situation.<br/>
<br/>
Your child may or may not be able to process the fact that the other<br/>
kids are frustrated. It seems that the more frustration and anger gets<br/>
directed at them, the more everything intensifies and builds. I&#39;ve<br/>
talked with my other children about being gentle and telling him<br/>
they&#39;ll help him if he will give them space. Just knowing he is being<br/>
heard, seems to diffuse the energy a bit.<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there. I feel like I&#39;m just blathering, but I can SO readily<br/>
relate to the challenge it is to parent an intense child. They are so<br/>
interesting and beautiful and it hurts when other people can&#39;t see<br/>
that beauty in them.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s so cool about my little man, is he is a huge catalyst for<br/>
growth in me. He is also AMAZING at honing in on people who are truly<br/>
respectful of him, while shunning those that aren&#39;t. We have found<br/>
some lovely friends who can truly honor him for who his IS. Those that<br/>
see his beauty and give him respect even when he&#39;s getting intense are<br/>
the people we prefer to be around. <br/>
<br/>
I love that he has such a sensitivity to respectful behaviors. I know<br/>
these intense, energetic children have so much to give to the world,<br/>
just as all our children do. Keep on trusting that and finding ways to<br/>
meet him where he is today.<br/>

ready to be with littler kids than he is~~<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is such good advice.<br/>
I just wanted to add that Jalen expressed to me very clearly that he<br/>
did NOT like little kids. He also does not like being &quot;little&quot;. He&#39;s<br/>
the youngest in our home, with a feeling in him that he is larger than<br/>
life.:) That must be SO frustrating to be trapped in a little body<br/>
when your ideas and autonomy are all about BIGNESS.<br/>
<br/>
He loves getting bigger. He talks about being taller than other<br/>
people, he WANTS to be grown up. This is totally opposite of all my<br/>
other children who never want to grow up.:) <br/>
<br/>
He told me he HATED a little guy that stayed with us for a little<br/>
while. K was such a sweet, sweet boy, but Jalen couldn&#39;t STAND him<br/>
because he was little.   I think for Jalen, these little people aren&#39;t<br/>
at his developmental level and he just can&#39;t understand it.<br/>
<br/>
They play with his toys, or don&#39;t listen when he has a game<br/>
idea...they&#39;re too little to understand what he is saying, but he<br/>
expects them to understand. When they don&#39;t act the way HE believes is<br/>
necessary, it angers him. He simply doesn&#39;t have the ability to be<br/>
patient or understanding with anyone at a different developmental<br/>
level (unless they are older). <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s ok. We needed to protect the younger children from Jalen and<br/>
him from frustration for a long time. So we limited contact. Many of<br/>
my friends can attest to his intensity with younger kids. <br/>
<br/>
Lately he&#39;s been fine. I still wouldn&#39;t turn my back on him with a<br/>
baby or small toddler. It&#39;s just not something he can handle.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I mean by meeting them where they are, rather than trying<br/>
to make them be where we&#39;d like.  <br/>
<br/>
Your child can&#39;t handle certain things right now. So you just have to<br/>
be proactive and limit the situations that frustrate. If a gathering<br/>
is creating a ton of negative energy, the entire point of gathering is<br/>
lost really. He might need more time one-on-one with you or just being<br/>
at home where his environment is more predictable.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-579881716">Thanks Marji!  I kind of got stuck in the mode of trying to change him and that is <br/>
obviously not going to work.  I agree with being present at all times with him interacting <br/>
with others and your suggestion of re-directing him to something that he really likes is <br/>
the key I think.  My dh & I were trying to re-direct, but weren&#39;t being very successful <br/>
coming up with something that he wanted to do otherewise.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always tried to focus on the positive things that he does for others and will say &quot;wow, <br/>
you sure made him happy when you did that&quot;, but your suggestion of talking about the <br/>
negative behaviors and how they make people feel I think will also help.<br/>
<br/>
I think your assumption about him feeling inferior might be something I need to look at <br/>
more closely.  When he is around older kids he knows well, they have no problem playing <br/>
together and working things out, when he is around older kids he doesn&#39;t know it&#39;s a <br/>
different story and that is I think when he starts to focus on the little kids wherever we are.  <br/>
When we are around older kids he doesn&#39;t know that&#39;s when he starts &quot;annoying&quot; the little <br/>
kids because he doesn&#39;t have anyone else to play with.  One exception is that he loves <br/>
babies!  If there is a baby around he will fawn all over them very gently.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1944152833">Thanks you so much for your post Ren.  I definitely needed some empathizing after this <br/>
weekend!<br/>
<br/>
Your description of your son definitely sounds similar to mine.  I have pinpointed certain <br/>
things just by being able to write my original post and read the responses.  If he feels <br/>
uncomfotable in a situation or doesn&#39;t know the kids then he either is very shy or very <br/>
aggressive.  For the most part if he knows the kids well, at any age, he seems to do fine.  <br/>
Mainly I guess it&#39;s if he knows the older kids well then he plays with them and it seems to <br/>
distract him from being aggressive with the little ones.  One exception is that he loves <br/>
babies and is for the most part very gentle with them.<br/>
<br/>
We have a great group of unschooling familes that we hang out with occasionally and <br/>
apart from a couple of 3 year olds that he seems to be aggressive with, he gets along with <br/>
all the kids.  <br/>
<br/>
I think one of the triggers to this weekend was that he doesn&#39;t see his cousins that often <br/>
and since the parents are constantly punishing, blaming & comparing the kids they in turn <br/>
do the same thing with my son and it sets him off.  Also they were getting in trouble for <br/>
doing some things that my son is free to do like using &quot;potty&quot; language.  Mind you this <br/>
isn&#39;t swearing, which I don&#39;t censor either in my son, he just doesn&#39;t swear much, this is <br/>
just kids saying &quot;poo poo head&quot; or &quot;your a fart head&quot; and all of them laughing about it only <br/>
the cousins get punished if the parents hear.  So again, in turn when my son uses &quot;potty&quot; <br/>
language they come and tell me or their parents in order for him to get punished like they <br/>
do and he will get aggressive yet again.<br/>
<br/>
I also see him intensify if someone is insinuating that he is being &quot;mean&quot;, I think most of <br/>
his behaviors aren&#39;t intended to hurt or be mean, just more like playing a little too rough, <br/>
but if he senses someone is accusing him of being mean then the behaviors worsen or <br/>
intensify.  That is why we too prefer to be around those that honor and respect him <br/>
especially when he is being intense, not giving him the impression that he&#39;s a mean <br/>
person, but rather just a child that is still growing and learning to socialize.<br/>
<br/>
He does have a gameboy and I&#39;ve noticed that here at our house if he is feeling <br/>
overwhelmed or getting to the point of being aggressive he will get it out or go downstairs <br/>
and get on the computer to calm down.  When we are at other people&#39;s houses then he <br/>
doesn&#39;t have that option.  Yesterday him and his two cousins all had their gameboys, but <br/>
Damek didn&#39;t want to play his, I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s time to get some new games as he seems <br/>
bored with the ones he has.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for &quot;blathering&quot; on, this post really helped me to switch gears.  I&#39;ve been slowing <br/>
getting more & more focused on &quot;how can I stop this&quot; and I know that is not where I want <br/>
to be.<br/>

&gt; needed him to give the other kids space (he has very little concept of<br/>
&gt; personal boundaries).  This could only happen in it&#39;s own time. There<br/>
&gt; is no way to &quot;teach&quot; this to anyone....you just love them up and wait.:)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This doesn&#39;t work in every situation or for every child, but at this<br/>
&gt; point with Jalen (when he&#39;s in the middle of being intense and unable<br/>
&gt; to acknowledge a person yelling &quot;STOP now&quot;) I can pick him up and kiss<br/>
&gt; his cheek, telling him &quot;I love you&quot; while redirecting his energy. That<br/>
&gt; sweet connection really works for us now. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; While I&#39;m giving him that hug or kiss, I can then say &quot; I really need<br/>
&gt; you to hear me right now&quot;  or &quot;I really need you to come out here with<br/>
&gt; me for just a minute&quot; to give some space to the situation.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Your child may or may not be able to process the fact that the other<br/>
&gt; kids are frustrated. It seems that the more frustration and anger gets<br/>
&gt; directed at them, the more everything intensifies and builds. I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; talked with my other children about being gentle and telling him<br/>
&gt; they&#39;ll help him if he will give them space. Just knowing he is being<br/>
&gt; heard, seems to diffuse the energy a bit.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hang in there. I feel like I&#39;m just blathering, but I can SO readily<br/>
&gt; relate to the challenge it is to parent an intense child. They are so<br/>
&gt; interesting and beautiful and it hurts when other people can&#39;t see<br/>
&gt; that beauty in them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What&#39;s so cool about my little man, is he is a huge catalyst for<br/>
&gt; growth in me. He is also AMAZING at honing in on people who are truly<br/>
&gt; respectful of him, while shunning those that aren&#39;t. We have found<br/>
&gt; some lovely friends who can truly honor him for who his IS. Those that<br/>
&gt; see his beauty and give him respect even when he&#39;s getting intense are<br/>
&gt; the people we prefer to be around. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I love that he has such a sensitivity to respectful behaviors. I know<br/>
&gt; these intense, energetic children have so much to give to the world,<br/>
&gt; just as all our children do. Keep on trusting that and finding ways to<br/>
&gt; meet him where he is today.<br/>

Ah yes. Jalen is extremely sensitive to that sort of thing. I would<br/>
definitely try to limit contact as much as possibly, until he&#39;s old<br/>
enough to have tools for dealing with that. *I* have a hard time being<br/>
around people that dole out punishments readily!<br/>

me more tools for dealing with issues the next time around. I&#39;m glad<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1393902166">We do try to limit contact, the only time we get together is at my mom&#39;s house and we <br/>
actually hadn&#39;t seen them since Easter (even though they only live about 5 blocks away <br/>
from us), it&#39;s just this weekend was my nephews birthday and then yesterday my brother <br/>
and his wife were in town so we all got together.  I&#39;m lucky in the fact that my mom seems <br/>
to really understand, even though she&#39;s not on board with all of our parenting ideals, but <br/>
she has in the past for minor holidays or when she just wants to see the grandchildren <br/>
invited us to come on different days to keep the peace.  <br/>
<br/>
He is definitely beautiful & sensitive, always has been and for the most part is loving and <br/>
kind with us and people he has accepted and feels comfortable with.  I want to continue to <br/>
celebrate him as he is and help him gain the necessary tools to help navigate the social <br/>
world when he is ready.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the dialogue, I&#39;ve learned a lot today and have already begun writing things <br/>
down for future reference.<br/>

We just had a similar weekend at my in-laws, and indeed, it has taken me this many days <br/>
to recover and be willing to get online. AND we came back a day early!<br/>
What is most painful is that one set of cousins wants desperately to come live with us, the <br/>
boy was rambling on and on about what a &#39;good servant&#39; he could be for me, making me <br/>
koolaid and sandwiches whenever I want. What eight year old thinks on those terms????<br/>
It&#39;s sick, and I&#39;m still sick. I&#39;m exhausted from being the only adult who was involved with <br/>
19 kids, and being kind and compassionate with these poor guys. I could go on and on, <br/>
and we were there for less than 24 hours.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1795770310">Wow!  19 kids, sounds exhausting!  Atleast they had a different sort of parent role model <br/>
to see in you, that people are in fact kind to children and want to spend time with them.  <br/>
That&#39;s sad that the cousins want to come live with you, it says a lot about how they feel <br/>
about their lives and parents.  It&#39;s funny, my son who is 5 loves to play with the neighbor <br/>
kids, but won&#39;t go to any of their houses, he always has to play at our house, even when <br/>
they invite him over there he says &quot;no, we can play here&quot;, and actually the neighbor kids all <br/>
want to play here not at their own houses, it&#39;s just that the parents will make the kids ask <br/>
Damek to come over I guess to balance it out so their not always at our house. <br/>
