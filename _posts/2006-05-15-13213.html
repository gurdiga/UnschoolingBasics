<div id="ygrps-yiv-767807556">Okay, in an effort to get my 16 mo old to drink more milk w/o feeling like I<br/>
have to &quot;force feed&quot; him by using a bottle...I am trying to figure out how<br/>
long I can leave his milk (soy milk & formula mixture) sippy cup out before<br/>
risking food poisoning and the like.  So does anyone know how long a glass<br/>
of soy milk (or otherwise) can be left out?  Also how many times can it be<br/>
taken out of the fridge for that length of time?  Does anyone know of a very<br/>
small (one or 2 sippy cup size) fridge I could put in the living room for<br/>
him to access?  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Why do you feel that your child *needs* more milk?  Milk is highly<br/>
overrated!  Seriously.  The reason that milk became the drink to have is<br/>
because it is an easy way for parents to get calcium, iron, protein and<br/>
calories into children.  Guess what?  Those things can be found in<br/>
plentitude in hundreds of other foods.  Children don&#39;t *need* milk if they<br/>
have other foods to eat.  In fact our species hasn&#39;t consumed cow&#39;s milk as<br/>
a beverage for a very long time (historically and genetically speaking).  It<br/>
is one reason why so many humans have problems digesting milk.  I know quite<br/>
a few people who cannot drink cow&#39;s milk (or cow milk products like cheese<br/>
and butter) but have no problem with goat milk and goat milk products.<br/>
<br/>
If your son isn&#39;t a big eater it may be that he doesn&#39;t have a need for all<br/>
those extra calories.  If he has his food unhindered he is going to eat and<br/>
oddly enough their bodies tend to gravitate towards the things that they<br/>
need.  I&#39;ve started doing this with myself.  When Dan and I go to the health<br/>
food store each weekend to get his coffee, I usually pick up chocolate as I<br/>
only like 2 different kinds and like that they are organic and slave free.<br/>
I decided to allow myself to get as much as I wanted.  I&#39;ve been getting<br/>
usually 2 bars a week which does me quite well.  I allow myself to have<br/>
chocolate whenever I like and have kept it around.  The kids don&#39;t care for<br/>
it too much because it tends to be a tad bitter because it has a high cocoa<br/>
content (or it has fruit in it and they think that is just wrong LOL!)  So<br/>
it is there for my taking.  This past weekend we went to the HFS and I<br/>
picked up some pears and some dehydrated green beans and a handful of other<br/>
things along with the coffee.  When we got outside I realized that I didn&#39;t<br/>
have any chocolate.  Dan asked if I needed to go inside and get some and I<br/>
said, &quot;No; come to think of it I still have a full bar in the cabinet.  And<br/>
these pears looked really good today.&quot;  I found that given the option of all<br/>
foods being available to me, my body will tell me what it is I want.<br/>
Children can do the same.<br/>
<br/>
If you want more information on milk and why it isn&#39;t a necessary thing let<br/>
me know.  This is a strong passion of mine.  I have 1 child that only<br/>
consumes milk on cereal and 2 children that do not consume milk at all<br/>
(other than an ocaissional glass of chocolate milk which they rarely ask<br/>
for!)  They are all strong, healthy and have never broken a bone and rarely<br/>
get sick despite the doctor&#39;s warnings that children who don&#39;t consume milk<br/>
will be weak, sick and their bones will break easily.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have to agree here.  My first nursed until age 2.5 and he&#39;s NEVER had <br/>
milk to drink.  He doesn&#39;t like it.  At nearly 5yo, he&#39;s finally eating <br/>
cereal with milk, but he still doesn&#39;t drink the leftover milk.  My 17mo <br/>
is still nursing, so he probably won&#39;t drink milk either.  My Ped <br/>
doesn&#39;t worry about it since there are lots of other ways to get <br/>
calcium, protein and Vitamin D in his diet.  I would like him to drink <br/>
it just for the fat content so maybe he&#39;ll gain a little weight, but <br/>
that&#39;s *my* thing and not his.  He&#39;s on the same growth curve (very <br/>
small side) as he&#39;s always been, so his body must be getting what it <br/>
needs.  It currently loves cheeseburgers ~ lol.<br/>
<br/>
Milk is totally overrated!<br/>

<br/>
Nursing is drinking lots of milk.  Now if you mean the dead <br/>
pasteurized 3 week old stuff you get in the supermarket that originally <br/>
came from cows or goats......yeah, its over rated.<br/>
<br/>
We drink raw, straight from the goat milk full of enzymes and with a <br/>
nutrient content not too disparate from human breast milk.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-407165733">I would like to add to the mother who began this post that just going with the child&#39;s natural flow of what they want to eat or not eat will help the child always be able to stay tuned into what s/he needs.  His body may not be in need of extra calcium or whatever milk and formula have to offer.  He may binge on one food one week and then another another week.  I am super sensitive to this fact with my children because I learned to tune out at some point and have problems with overeating.  I don&#39;t think that all people do but as I see radical unschooling, it is really about helping children stay in tuned with their own internal knowing which I am learning is always right.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-322022787">I agree with the others - my DS didn&#39;t drink cow&#39;s milk until he was <br/>
around 3 yrs old and we switched back to 1% or 2% to use on cereal and <br/>
the like. He still prefers not to drink whole milk at all and uses <br/>
milk for cereal, as chocolate milk, and to dunk cookies (the milk <br/>
that&#39;s left rarely gets consumed because he doesn&#39;t like the crumbs <br/>
left in it). It&#39;s a rare day that he actually will just drink a glass <br/>
of milk. He does like cheese A LOT so we usually have a variety on <br/>
hand. Cheese was his preferred snack for that whole time when he <br/>
didn&#39;t drink milk, along with yogurt. <br/>
<br/>
If your child doesn&#39;t want to drink milk, don&#39;t force it. Odds are he <br/>
knows better than you what he needs. Go with that. Keep a varied <br/>
supply of fruits, nuts (if they are safe in your family), whole <br/>
grains, veggies, etc. and he&#39;ll be fine.<br/>
