<div id="ygrps-yiv-1686857398">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I have two children, Karl (age 2 TODAY), and Jacien age 5 months.  I may be starting early but I am exploring methods of homeschooling/ unschooling.  I am new to all of it, and just want to get information.  I have heard unschooling mentioned on other sites and I am interested in knowing more about it.  I am new to natural parenting as well, and could use support with it.<br/>
<br/>
I am mainly a lurker due to time constraints, but do want to introduce myself, and let ya&#39;ll know I will be reading and learning!  Thank you!<br/>
<br/>
