<div id="ygrps-yiv-1199459605">Thanks for your suggestions Deb. We do make some stuff at home but<br/>
I&#39;ve slowly drifted away from that over the years as our lives got<br/>
busier - I&#39;m going back to baking more which will help. We do use<br/>
brown rice, beans, and lentils but I&#39;ve realized they could all be<br/>
made more frequently, especially since they are enjoyed so. Last night<br/>
I made the kids Mud Soup (black bean base) which they love (and it&#39;s<br/>
so simple to make). I&#39;m wondering why I haven&#39;t made it more often,<br/>
but that will change. We were making trips to Whole Foods every few<br/>
months to stock up but with gas prices right now we wouldn&#39;t be saving<br/>
much. Sometimes it&#39;s just fun to go shopping at Whole Foods, though<br/>
and it&#39;s neat day trip.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone who has responded to my request for suggestions &<br/>
advice. The past two weekends (when we do our grocery shopping) I&#39;ve<br/>
made a point to buy more of their favorite foods. Since we ran out of<br/>
their soy ice cream halfway through last week I made sure to buy<br/>
double this week. They liked the cookies & brownies we made Thursday,<br/>
so I stocked up on the ingredients. I&#39;ve talked to 2 of my local<br/>
grocery stores to see if they can start to carry (or at least order<br/>
for me) a few of their favorite products, like soy yogurt and rice<br/>
&quot;graham&quot; crackers. I&#39;m willing to buy a case at a time if necessary.<br/>
<br/>
This experience has also given me a chance to reflect on another<br/>
thread from several months ago about making errands and similar things<br/>
enjoyable for kids, such as grocery shopping. It&#39;s what would normally<br/>
be considered a tedious, boring task, but each week I&#39;ve been finding<br/>
a few more small ways to make it enjoyable for all of us.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for all the ideas!<br/>
<br/>
