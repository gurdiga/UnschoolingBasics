I&#39;ve heard this often about getting rid of a t.v., and my dh, a technology<br/>
junky always wants the bigger and better one.  Even though he complains he<br/>
doesn&#39;t get enough sex and I&#39;ve told him it&#39;s b/c of the t.v.  A close<br/>
friend of mine, one of the ones who helped get me into homeschooling doesn&#39;t<br/>
believe in letting her child (2.5) watch t.v.   Someone in her family has a<br/>
6 yo that has never watched it, and that&#39;s kind of her goal.  It&#39;s something<br/>
I&#39;ve struggled with.  If I&#39;d never shown my dd she wouldn&#39;t ask for it.<br/>
Fortunately I feel we&#39;ve reached a happy medium over her t.v. watching.<br/>

MIL and we watch a lot of videos. With 3 computers we all spend a lot of<br/>
time on line. DD&#39;s computer is in the living room/dining room which is where<br/>
mine is. So we do spend a lot of time talking and learning.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We used to not have one.  Well, we had one, but we didn&#39;t have cable and the<br/>
antenna picked up nothing!  We didn&#39;t have tv for a year and it was nice,<br/>
but I wouldnt&#39; say it was more or less liberating than having one.  We enjoy<br/>
tv, but we don&#39;t feel tied to it (and especially since we have gotten DVR!)<br/>
We actually have 3 televisions, 2 DVD players, and a Play Station.  They are<br/>
just things to do.  We don&#39;t look at it as good or bad.  The kids have been<br/>
known to watch anything from cartoons to documentaries and movies that their<br/>
schooled peers would never consider.  It provides a resource for imagination<br/>
play and in helping set goals and interests.  I see it as no worse or better<br/>
than the computer, books, or going outside and playing.  None of us watches<br/>
what would be construed as A LOT of tv.  And I&#39;ve often walked through the<br/>
living room to find the tv on and no one watching it even though they might<br/>
be in the room.<br/>

stories down or how to cook or how to sew) she wouldn&#39;t ask for it.<br/>
<br/>
TV is not a demon. It&#39;s just another medium. It&#39;s another window to  <br/>
the world, more akin, in fact, to the internet and the library than  <br/>
to a book.<br/>
<br/>
Some unschoolers don&#39;t live near a good library. Some don&#39;t live near  <br/>
a park. Some can&#39;t afford cable/satellite and don&#39;t have reception.  <br/>
Some will never see Paris. Kids do grow up fine without access to  <br/>
everything. But if we as a family *decide* that our children should  <br/>
not have access to TV (or a library or the internet or trips to the  <br/>
park) because we don&#39;t like it, we&#39;re deliberately limiting them when  <br/>
we, as unschoolers, should be expanding their worlds.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1073964934">We have three tv&#39;s, and a DVD player that runs constantly. One tv not  <br/>
so much because there is almost no screen left, but Josh has it in  <br/>
his room and will use it to play video games when he wants the girls  <br/>
to be able to watch movies without stress. he&#39;s figuring out ways to  <br/>
buy his own TV because he doesn&#39;t want to ask us to buy one for him.  <br/>
There&#39;s a tv in my room that the kids flip thru for noncartoon shows  <br/>
that they can lounge in bed to watch, and then the tv in our game  <br/>
room that has cartoons or pbs running thru the day (or video games,  <br/>
we have an xbox, snes, n64 and gamecube hooked up to it besides the  <br/>
VCR and DVD player). The portable DVD player usually has Breanna&#39;s  <br/>
current favorite, usually Nemo, Ice Age, or Lilo and Stitch.<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mention the four computers that they have access too,  <br/>
two of which will play DVD&#39;s, and usually Josh will get on and watch  <br/>
Mario TV.<br/>
I dunno, they enjoy it, they learn a lot from it, and I enjoy  <br/>
spending time with them doing it.<br/>
