<div id="ygrps-yiv-827978589">What I Learned About Teaching Children From Teaching Adults<br/>
Copyright Â©1999 by Matthew Harre <br/>
I teach in a privileged environment. I meet one to one with my  students. I <br/>
have no institution looking over my shoulder. I give no grades. I  work with a <br/>
constantly fluid situation that requires immediate assessment. As a  result I <br/>
can&#39;t plan too far ahead and have great flexibility. I have the  opportunity <br/>
to get to know my students better than most teachers do.  <br/>
What I&#39;ve learned from my adult students is that the bruises  they suffered <br/>
in their education as children and young adults interferes with  their learning <br/>
to play the piano much more than any problems of an aging mind or  body. What <br/>
I have learned to do for my students who are children is to try to do  no <br/>
harm.  <br/>
I don&#39;t mean that sweet goodie-goodie stuff, that everything&#39;s  &quot;all right&quot; <br/>
when it&#39;s not. I hate that. It&#39;s dishonest and without integrity.  It&#39;s wrong.  <br/>
I&#39;m talking about making corrections with compassion. Letting  students know <br/>
it&#39;s difficult being corrected, especially when they think they&#39;re  right. <br/>
Letting them know that I know being wrong can be embarrassing and  humiliating. <br/>
Letting them know it&#39;s all right to be angry and hurt. Even letting  them know <br/>
I won&#39;t be angry with them for being angry with me.  <br/>
I enjoy my adult students very much. I&#39;m struck by their  cautiousness, <br/>
carefulness, desire to be perfect, and their utter lack of charity  towards <br/>
themselves. Where&#39;s the insatiable curiosity of infancy? Where&#39;s the  eagerness for <br/>
adventure? Where&#39;s the willingness to try new things? Where&#39;s the  little kid <br/>
who&#39;s willing to fall down over and over again in his desire to learn  to walk? <br/>
For virtually all my adult students, and myself, this has been somehow  <br/>
knocked out of us.  <br/>
How did we arrive at this state? I believe we got bruised in  many small and <br/>
big ways at all levels of our education. People who teach can be  insensitive, <br/>
inconsiderate and, sometimes, even sadistic. Parents are our  teachers, too, <br/>
and sometimes they can be the biggest problem.  <br/>
If you&#39;ll permit me a few moments of gross over-simplifying, I&#39;d  like to <br/>
make some observations about our learning. Infants are insatiable in  their <br/>
curiosity about the world. They do all kinds of things to find out what&#39;s  what. <br/>
Unfortunately, some are dangerous-like chewing on the electrical cord;  some are <br/>
inconvenient--like flushing their shoes down the toilet to see what  happens; <br/>
and some of their experiments just don&#39;t fit the timing or moods of the  <br/>
powers that be. All these limitations reign in this unbridled curiosity. I  <br/>
consider these bruises. They&#39;re little hurts that stopped us and began a long  <br/>
process that took our learning agenda out of our own hands. These limits on our  <br/>
curiosity may have been necessary from the adult perspective but not, certainly, <br/>
 from our perspective as a child.  <br/>
It&#39;s not too long before we become curious about words and  ideas. With this <br/>
curiosity comes the necessity of learning to read. What if  you&#39;re interested <br/>
in ideas but not interested in reading, or have difficulty  reading? You&#39;re in <br/>
trouble in our society.  <br/>
When people go to school or take lessons they lose control of  the agenda of <br/>
their curiosity. Teachers take over the subject and timing of  learning. The <br/>
individual&#39;s curiosity no longer leads. In some places it counts  for nothing. <br/>
No matter who we are, how good or bad a student we are, the natural  instincts <br/>
of our own curiosity suffered many bruises.  <br/>
In a real sense, the pleasures and rewards of satisfying our  curiosity were <br/>
taken away from us. School is not about rewarding our own  curiosity, it&#39;s <br/>
about learning what others want us to learn; it&#39;s about pleasing  teachers. If we <br/>
were successful in school the one thing we had to learn was to  make teachers <br/>
happy enough to give us good grades. We may or may not have  learned things <br/>
interesting to us, but that wasn&#39;t the point. Successful students  must please <br/>
enough teachers to get enough good grades to continue in the  process.  <br/>
Then, having already lost the agenda and rewards of our own  curiosity, we <br/>
come to believe that pleasing the teacher is the same as pleasing  ourselves. We <br/>
substitute learning how we want with learning the way that will  make the <br/>
teacher happy. We think pleasing the teacher is the same as pleasing  ourselves. <br/>
It isn&#39;t. That&#39;s why so many straight &quot;A&quot; students are unfulfilled by  their <br/>
accomplishment. They feel a void. They&#39;ve become so adept at pleasing  other <br/>
people that they forget they have a self that needs being pleased.  <br/>
My adult students are educationally successful. Most have  doctorates or law <br/>
degrees. Some appear regularly on TV. All are successful as we  define that <br/>
concept. They have played the education game well enough to win some  of the top <br/>
prizes. They are all taking lessons because they want to; nobody is  making <br/>
them do it. They pay for it themselves. Yet they all seem to want to  please <br/>
me. Well ... I&#39;m not a Ph.D. and I was not a particularly successful  student. <br/>
So why are all these brilliant people interested in pleasing me?  <br/>
I must confess, it&#39;s been a gradually unfolding shock to me to  realize how <br/>
crucial it is for them to make me happy. Fortunately or  unfortunately, I <br/>
thought I was supposed to make them happy so they&#39;d keep on  hiring me and I&#39;d have <br/>
a job. I seemed to have missed the point entirely. I  hadn&#39;t realized how <br/>
much power I had; how much power they gave me. If making the  teacher happy is <br/>
what it&#39;s all about, and I&#39;m the teacher--it&#39;s my power trip.  <br/>
For whatever reasons make me the person I am, I don&#39;t feel the  need for this <br/>
power trip. Certainly part of the reason has to do with the  teachers I had, <br/>
at least in music. I teach because I want to be part of the mix  of the world <br/>
of music and the world of my individual student&#39;s mind. It is a  fascinating <br/>
place to be. I don&#39;t feel the need to control or force the outcome.  I do want <br/>
my students to be pleased with their work in music.  <br/>
You would not believe how difficult it is to get adult students  to be <br/>
pleased with their work. It wasn&#39;t until I started listening to them talk  to <br/>
themselves that I really began to realize how much their past education had  taken <br/>
from them. When they make mistakes they say things like: &quot;That was  stupid,&quot; <br/>
&quot;What are you thinking of?&quot; or &quot;Oh, my God.&quot; The condescension in their  voices <br/>
is impressive. They are not talking to themselves with their own voices;  they <br/>
are talking to themselves with the voices of past teachers and parents.  <br/>
Ponder the enormity of this. They have become their own attackers. When did they  <br/>
abandon themselves and join the accusers? Who is left to defend them?  <br/>
One of my adult students was playing for me and playing well,  with feeling. <br/>
I was enjoying her playing. All of a sudden she yelled, &quot;No, no  that&#39;s not <br/>
right!&quot; I was startled. I hadn&#39;t even heard the mistake. Less than a  minute <br/>
later the same thing happened. Again I was startled but also annoyed. I  was <br/>
enjoying her playing and concentrating on it-when this scream interrupted.  When <br/>
it happened a third time I was angry. I stopped her and said, &quot;You keep  <br/>
getting me involved in your playing and then scare me with your screaming. What  are <br/>
you doing?&quot; &quot;Sorry, sorry, sorry,&quot; she said, &quot;I&#39;ll stop. I didn&#39;t realize I  <br/>
was bothering you.&quot;  <br/>
She apologized for bothering me. Adults apologize to teachers a  lot. What I <br/>
realized, and what we talked about, was that what I felt must have  been how <br/>
she felt when she was playing for her teacher as a child. She&#39;d be  intently <br/>
involved in her music-making when the teacher would yell and scare her.  In the <br/>
present case, I was the teacher. I could get annoyed and tell her to  quit. <br/>
But when it happened to her, she was the child and the student. If she&#39;d  <br/>
reacted to her teacher as I reacted to her, she would have been called rude and  <br/>
impudent and this particular teacher would have hit her. I&#39;ve seen this woman  <br/>
make a mistake and cover her head to ward off the impending blow.  <br/>
How can a person be totally involved in their learning if they  are waiting <br/>
for someone to yell at them or hit them? A part of them must always  be <br/>
watching and waiting for the interruption or attack. I don&#39;t yell at my  students, <br/>
young or old.  <br/>
The final irony of this sad tale is that the woman was her  teacher&#39;s best <br/>
student. She was working on Beethoven&#39;s Pathetique Sonata at the  age of 12. Her <br/>
teacher had never had such a gifted student. Why did she feel the  need to <br/>
treat her student this way? People do not understand that being a  teacher&#39;s <br/>
best student can bring with it a number of disadvantages. Educational  problems <br/>
are always assumed to be the domain of lesser students, but there is a  whole <br/>
raft of problems the really good students experience. Teachers push them  too <br/>
fast and too far, beyond what they can really experience. Teachers become  <br/>
possessive of the student and the student&#39;s accomplishment. Teachers  <br/>
over-identify with their best students, especially if the former don&#39;t have a  fulfilling <br/>
life of their own. Actually, this subject is a whole other talk.  <br/>
The woman I&#39;m talking about is not an educational failure. She  has her Ph.D. <br/>
and was president of a small Midwestern college for several years  before <br/>
taking lessons with me. She has achieved much in educational circles  including <br/>
power over teachers. Clearly this accomplishment has done nothing to  erase the <br/>
impact of her childhood piano teacher. The power of this early  experience is <br/>
tenacious. It will take time and work to move beyond the  experience.  <br/>
Another example of the tenaciousness of this kind of abuse was  told by <br/>
another adult student of mine at the 10th anniversary celebration of the  Adult <br/>
Music Student Forum. Tom read the following: &quot;The man you see before you  now is <br/>
approaching his sixties. And yet, he can remember with stark clarity the  <br/>
severe brutalization that he endured for nearly a full year when he was a mere  <br/>
slip of a lad in his second year of elementary school. This torture he suffered  <br/>
at the hands of none other than his piano teacher, one Sister Mary <br/>
Florentine.  <br/>
&quot;Sister Mary Florentine&#39;s most notable trait as a music teacher  was a truly <br/>
remarkable intolerance for wrong notes. To say she was a stickler  for <br/>
perfection just doesn&#39;t fully capture it. During lessons she would usually  stand <br/>
behind and a little to the right of the student, gently cradling her  weapon of <br/>
choice. That, of course, was the standard issue twelve-inch wooden  ruler with <br/>
the embedded brass straightedge. She would position herself  <br/>
strategically-just beyond the student&#39;s range of peripheral vision and just  within striking <br/>
distance of the keyboard.  <br/>
&quot;Imagine yourself in this tableau-a young innocent boy, hands  poised just <br/>
above the keyboard with its hundreds of nicks and notches reflecting  decades of <br/>
wrong notes, each quickly followed by errant ruler strikes or  ricochets. <br/>
Imagine the strikes that found their intended targets. Imagine  yourself playing <br/>
The Blue Danube Waltz in that situation.  <br/>
&quot;Now fast forward about forty years. My family and career were  by now well <br/>
established. My life was on course and cruising along. Yet there  remained a <br/>
vague gnawing feeling in the pit of my stomach--something missing or  <br/>
unresolved. It eventually evolved into a desire to take piano lessons.  <br/>
&quot;My memory of the experience with Sister Mary Florentine formed  the basis of <br/>
my expectations regarding lessons with Matt. For example, I  naturally <br/>
expected some form of torture to be an integral part of each lesson...   <br/>
&quot;But even from the first lesson it was clear that Matt was no  Sister Mary <br/>
Florentine. For example, during lessons he seated himself  practically all the <br/>
way across the room, way beyond striking range. Some of  Matt&#39;s idiosyncrasies <br/>
were a little confusing at first. Consider his seating  arrangements-highly <br/>
varied and always interesting. When he conducted lessons  while seated on a <br/>
medicine ball, I found myself occasionally wondering how he  could throw the <br/>
medicine ball at me while he was seated on it. I feared there  might be some trick. <br/>
My frame of reference did not permit me to imagine that he  might simply be <br/>
trying to ease his back pain.  <br/>
&quot;I cannot say that any of his approaches was particularly  effective for me, <br/>
but all of them together seemed to have considerable benefit.  After two or <br/>
three years, I found myself actually focusing on the music. With  Matt&#39;s <br/>
continued teaching ... I found myself playing at least elementary pieces  with actual <br/>
enjoyment.&quot;  <br/>
For Tom as the second-grader, getting right notes was not for  the joy of the <br/>
sound, not for the joy of physical mastery, not for the joy of  learning. <br/>
Getting right notes was to keep from being hurt. What he learned was  not about <br/>
music but about self-preservation. What he learned was that some  teachers are <br/>
mean and will hurt you. Here success is not about feeling good  about <br/>
yourself; it&#39;s about being hit less.  <br/>
Tom and I have been friends for at least ten years. I taught his  daughter <br/>
piano for some time. I had known her from birth. We would all go  Christmas <br/>
caroling every year together with other neighbors, then go back to  their home for <br/>
Irish coffee. He knew the kind of person I am.  <br/>
But this knowledge became irrelevant when Tom started taking  lessons. What <br/>
Tom knew of me could not erase the terror of his earlier  experience. The <br/>
history that was relevant was the horror of his earlier piano  lessons. When I was <br/>
teaching Tom, I lost my identity to Sister Mary Florentine.  It took Tom two <br/>
or three years to actually focus on the music. It took that much  time to undo <br/>
the meanness of his earlier teacher.  <br/>
The tragedy is that people who are abused come to identify with  the abuser <br/>
and feel they should be abused; they deserve it. Compassion is hard  to accept. <br/>
That&#39;s one of the reasons my adult students talk to themselves as  they do. <br/>
You may now better understand why I say what I try to do for my young  students <br/>
is to do no harm.  <br/>
The yelling, hitting, and condescending nuances are all  humiliating and <br/>
embarrassing. This humiliation seems to be a common part of  everybody&#39;s <br/>
education. Everybody I&#39;ve talked to about what I planned to say  today has his or her <br/>
own set of examples. They usually haven&#39;t thought to ponder  them, but rather, <br/>
regarded them as an assumption of the whole process. Everybody  has <br/>
experienced this embarrassment. By high school the kids started doing the  same thing to <br/>
each other. One outcome of this is anger-fear and anger. I want to  return to <br/>
this in a minute but first there seems to be a special humiliation we  <br/>
experienced as students.  <br/>
That humiliation came from thinking we were right when we were  wrong. The <br/>
teacher pulled the rug out from under us by telling us (and everybody  else) <br/>
that we were wrong, that we didn&#39;t have a clue, missed the whole point,  were <br/>
stupid or whatever. The implied corollary was &quot;pride goeth before a fall.&quot;  I <br/>
cannot get my adult students to say they played well. They think I&#39;m going to  <br/>
say their playing was awful. They think I&#39;m trying to set them up for this  <br/>
embarrassment. They think that because it&#39;s happened to them before.  <br/>
Recently, I had a student confess to thinking she played a piece  well for <br/>
me. There was something negative I wanted to point out so I knew I was  in <br/>
trouble. I tried to head it off but I failed. I said five things that were  <br/>
truthful and positive about her performance. I said one thing needed work. She  never <br/>
heard the five good things, only the one bad.  <br/>
Everything I feared came pouring out. I&#39;d set her up; I&#39;d  embarrassed her; I <br/>
was just trying to show her how little she knew compared to  me ... all of <br/>
it. What she said was that I was like all her other teachers, and  having a <br/>
Ph.D., she&#39;d had a lot of teachers. She was really angry with me and  embarrassed <br/>
by her anger. But she was angry and we talked about it and the  discussions <br/>
went on for probably three lessons. Neither one of us capitulated  but each <br/>
clarified what we&#39;d said and felt. Her anger freed something in her and  her <br/>
playing became significantly better in the week that followed. I&#39;ve had this  <br/>
experience before. Release of anger at the teacher seems to free students to  <br/>
invest themselves more fully. I don&#39;t fully understand this. Perhaps the  <br/>
truthfulness of the anger and the teacher&#39;s acceptance of that anger allow the  student <br/>
a deeper level of commitment.  <br/>
My favorite story about anger at teachers is my own experience:  <br/>
I took my one and only viola lesson a couple years ago with  Rodger <br/>
Ellsworth, the son of the man who ran Ellsworth Studio over on Willow  Lane. The <br/>
difference was the teacher was my friend. Rodger dropped in one  evening after a <br/>
performance at the Kennedy Center asking if I wanted a viola  lesson. I said, &quot;Of <br/>
course not.&quot; In principle it was a fine idea but I had a  thousand reasons <br/>
for not wanting to do it. Rodger persisted, saying it would be  a good way to <br/>
know what my adult students felt like and other such reasonable  nonsense. I <br/>
relented and took my first lesson. The result was not as I expected  at all.  <br/>
Tensely, I put the viola under my chin and the bow in hand. I  started to <br/>
listen to his many instructions, some of which seemed contradictory  to me. What <br/>
I didn&#39;t expect was I got really furious. I told him he didn&#39;t know  how to <br/>
teach; that I was going to take this viola and smash it over his head and  other <br/>
such violence. I was livid. Being the friend he was, Rodger was able to  <br/>
accept all this, calmly.  <br/>
When I finished my outburst and settled down I found I was  drawing the bow <br/>
over the strings with an ease and firmness I had not imagined  possible.  <br/>
My outburst of anger apparently released my frustration at being  in an <br/>
awkward situation, feeling out of control, and feeling inferior. Having  discharged <br/>
that tension I was free to engage in the learning activity fully,  without <br/>
distraction. Rodger was a friend. I knew I could be angry with him. Had  I been <br/>
working with a regular teacher, there would have been no such outburst. I  <br/>
would have been the usual polite student. I would have been stuck with my anger  <br/>
and I would not have learned nearly as fast or as much. This is the position <br/>
of  most students.  <br/>
I encourage my young students to vent their anger at music,  practicing, and <br/>
me. I let them know I am strong enough to take it and won&#39;t get  mad at them <br/>
for telling me. When it happens, and it&#39;s not often, I don&#39;t take  their anger <br/>
personally. I don&#39;t feel they&#39;re being rude or impudent. I know that  to <br/>
really love something you have to have the freedom to sometimes hate it.  <br/>
Another of my favorite stories is about Clare. This is an  example of what I <br/>
learned about teaching children from teaching adults. I was  ready and I <br/>
finally handled one of these situations right.  <br/>
I was working with Clare, and it happened to be her 7th  birthday. She was in <br/>
her second year of piano. Clare is fun, smart, honest, and  polite. She <br/>
played her piece for me with the right hand playing one note higher  than written. <br/>
Instead of &quot;B&quot; she started on &quot;C,&quot; etc. Though it didn&#39;t sound  quite right, <br/>
it didn&#39;t sound too bad either. Clare thought it sounded fine. I  asked her to <br/>
play the right hand one note lower, i.e. the correct way, and she  thought <br/>
that sounded weird. She played it again the wrong way and found it  better. In <br/>
other words, she played wrong all week. Thinking she was right, she  was pleased <br/>
with herself and her work.  <br/>
I told Clare I hated to tell her but she played all the  right-hand notes one <br/>
note too high. Clare was silent but her big brown eyes  filled with tears. I <br/>
apologized and told her I felt it was important to be  honest with her.  <br/>
I asked her if she felt dumb and stupid and she said, &quot;Sort of.&quot;   <br/>
&quot;Does it make you mad?&quot;  <br/>
&quot;Sort of.&quot;  <br/>
&quot;Do you feel it in your body anywhere?&quot;  <br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;  <br/>
&quot;Well, do you feel it in your chest or stomach?&quot;  <br/>
&quot;Both.&quot;  <br/>
&quot;It hurts doesn&#39;t it?&quot;  <br/>
&quot;Yeah.&quot;  <br/>
Recently I asked Clare if I could tell this story in a talk I  was giving. <br/>
She said sure but she didn&#39;t remember the incident. To Clare, it was  not a <br/>
memorable event. That&#39;s exactly the way it should have been. Had I  unleashed any <br/>
of those lines teachers are famous for like &quot;How could you have  made that <br/>
same stupid mistake all week long? Do you ever look at the notes?,&quot; I  think <br/>
she&#39;d have remembered. She was already embarrassed by her mistake and her  <br/>
assumption of correctness. What I did was to &quot;hold her hand&quot; while she got in  touch <br/>
with how really rotten it did feel, right into her chest and stomach. With  <br/>
both of us accepting all these feelings she could then let go of them and we  <br/>
could move on.  <br/>
What I&#39;ve learned from my adult students is how much our  education hurts, <br/>
how much we all suffered to get where we are, and how much  teachers&#39; <br/>
remembrance of their own history makes them repeat it rather than  correct it. What I&#39;ve <br/>
learned is how rare is the consideration of students&#39;  feelings, not <br/>
withstanding some wonderful exceptions.  <br/>
Most of all, I&#39;ve learned the value of compassion in education,  allowing the <br/>
students the space to learn and know all the diverse emotions  involved in <br/>
learning. It&#39;s not dramatic; it&#39;s just kind. It doesn&#39;t call  attention to <br/>
itself; it does no harm. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-355444780">Hi friends and Kelly<br/>
Thank you for sending this wonderful article by Matthew Harre to the list.<br/>
<br/>
As I was reading it I once more understood why my youngest cannot fit into<br/>
any school environment at all. His early years were spent in an environment<br/>
of &#39;unschooling&#39; and never being told how to learn and what to learn and<br/>
when to learn what and how good or bad he was doing with anything he was<br/>
doing.  So when he had his pre-school &#39;Kindergarten&#39; experience it caught<br/>
him sideways that &#39;being good&#39; meant doing what felt bad. And his short<br/>
school history just added to that.<br/>
<br/>
This morning he asked me what is a rebel and what is a terrorist and what<br/>
would be the difference. I &#39;feel&#39; that there is a great difference, but I<br/>
don&#39;t think I could really explain this to his satisfaction. Could you help<br/>
me, please.<br/>
<br/>
Blessed be<br/>
Ulrike<br/>

What I Learned About Teaching Children From Teaching Adults<br/>
Copyright Â©1999 by Matthew Harre<br/>

I enjoy my adult students very much. I&#39;m struck by their  cautiousness,<br/>
carefulness, desire to be perfect, and their utter lack of charity  towards<br/>
themselves. Where&#39;s the insatiable curiosity of infancy? Where&#39;s the<br/>
eagerness for<br/>
adventure? Where&#39;s the willingness to try new things? Where&#39;s the  little<br/>
kid<br/>
who&#39;s willing to fall down over and over again in his desire to learn  to<br/>
walk?<br/>
For virtually all my adult students, and myself, this has been somehow<br/>
knocked out of us.<br/>
How did we arrive at this state? I believe we got bruised in  many small and<br/>
big ways at all levels of our education. People who teach can be<br/>
insensitive,<br/>
inconsiderate and, sometimes, even sadistic. Parents are our  teachers, too,<br/>
and sometimes they can be the biggest problem.<br/>
If you&#39;ll permit me a few moments of gross over-simplifying, I&#39;d  like to<br/>
make some observations about our learning. Infants are insatiable in  their<br/>
curiosity about the world. They do all kinds of things to find out what&#39;s<br/>
what.<br/>
Unfortunately, some are dangerous-like chewing on the electrical cord;  some<br/>
are<br/>
inconvenient--like flushing their shoes down the toilet to see what<br/>
happens;<br/>
and some of their experiments just don&#39;t fit the timing or moods of the<br/>
powers that be. All these limitations reign in this unbridled curiosity. I<br/>
consider these bruises. They&#39;re little hurts that stopped us and began a<br/>
long<br/>
process that took our learning agenda out of our own hands. These limits on<br/>
our<br/>
curiosity may have been necessary from the adult perspective but not,<br/>
certainly,<br/>
 from our perspective as a child.<br/>
It&#39;s not too long before we become curious about words and  ideas. With this<br/>
curiosity comes the necessity of learning to read. What if  you&#39;re<br/>
interested<br/>
in ideas but not interested in reading, or have difficulty  reading? You&#39;re<br/>
in<br/>
trouble in our society.<br/>
When people go to school or take lessons they lose control of  the agenda of<br/>
their curiosity. Teachers take over the subject and timing of  learning. The<br/>
individual&#39;s curiosity no longer leads. In some places it counts  for<br/>
nothing.<br/>
No matter who we are, how good or bad a student we are, the natural<br/>
instincts<br/>
of our own curiosity suffered many bruises.<br/>
In a real sense, the pleasures and rewards of satisfying our  curiosity were<br/>
taken away from us. School is not about rewarding our own  curiosity, it&#39;s<br/>
about learning what others want us to learn; it&#39;s about pleasing  teachers.<br/>
If we<br/>
were successful in school the one thing we had to learn was to  make<br/>
teachers<br/>
happy enough to give us good grades. We may or may not have  learned things<br/>
interesting to us, but that wasn&#39;t the point. Successful students  must<br/>
please<br/>
enough teachers to get enough good grades to continue in the  process.<br/>
Then, having already lost the agenda and rewards of our own  curiosity, we<br/>
come to believe that pleasing the teacher is the same as pleasing<br/>
ourselves. We<br/>
substitute learning how we want with learning the way that will  make the<br/>
teacher happy. We think pleasing the teacher is the same as pleasing<br/>
ourselves.<br/>
It isn&#39;t. That&#39;s why so many straight &quot;A&quot; students are unfulfilled by  their<br/>
accomplishment. They feel a void. They&#39;ve become so adept at pleasing  other<br/>
people that they forget they have a self that needs being pleased.<br/>
My adult students are educationally successful. Most have  doctorates or law<br/>
degrees. Some appear regularly on TV. All are successful as we  define that<br/>
concept. They have played the education game well enough to win some  of the<br/>
top<br/>
prizes. They are all taking lessons because they want to; nobody is  making<br/>
them do it. They pay for it themselves. Yet they all seem to want to  please<br/>
me. Well ... I&#39;m not a Ph.D. and I was not a particularly successful<br/>
student.<br/>
So why are all these brilliant people interested in pleasing me?<br/>
I must confess, it&#39;s been a gradually unfolding shock to me to  realize how<br/>
crucial it is for them to make me happy. Fortunately or  unfortunately, I<br/>
thought I was supposed to make them happy so they&#39;d keep on  hiring me and<br/>
I&#39;d have<br/>
a job. I seemed to have missed the point entirely. I  hadn&#39;t realized how<br/>
much power I had; how much power they gave me. If making the  teacher happy<br/>
is<br/>
what it&#39;s all about, and I&#39;m the teacher--it&#39;s my power trip.<br/>
For whatever reasons make me the person I am, I don&#39;t feel the  need for<br/>
this<br/>
power trip. Certainly part of the reason has to do with the  teachers I had,<br/>
at least in music. I teach because I want to be part of the mix  of the<br/>
world<br/>
of music and the world of my individual student&#39;s mind. It is a  fascinating<br/>
place to be. I don&#39;t feel the need to control or force the outcome.  I do<br/>
want<br/>
my students to be pleased with their work in music.<br/>
You would not believe how difficult it is to get adult students  to be<br/>
pleased with their work. It wasn&#39;t until I started listening to them talk<br/>
to<br/>
themselves that I really began to realize how much their past education had<br/>
taken<br/>
from them. When they make mistakes they say things like: &quot;That was  stupid,&quot;<br/>
&quot;What are you thinking of?&quot; or &quot;Oh, my God.&quot; The condescension in their<br/>
voices<br/>
is impressive. They are not talking to themselves with their own voices;<br/>
they<br/>
are talking to themselves with the voices of past teachers and parents.<br/>
Ponder the enormity of this. They have become their own attackers. When did<br/>
they<br/>
abandon themselves and join the accusers? Who is left to defend them?<br/>
One of my adult students was playing for me and playing well,  with feeling.<br/>
I was enjoying her playing. All of a sudden she yelled, &quot;No, no  that&#39;s not<br/>
right!&quot; I was startled. I hadn&#39;t even heard the mistake. Less than a  minute<br/>
later the same thing happened. Again I was startled but also annoyed. I  was<br/>
enjoying her playing and concentrating on it-when this scream interrupted.<br/>
When<br/>
it happened a third time I was angry. I stopped her and said, &quot;You keep<br/>
getting me involved in your playing and then scare me with your screaming.<br/>
What  are<br/>
you doing?&quot; &quot;Sorry, sorry, sorry,&quot; she said, &quot;I&#39;ll stop. I didn&#39;t realize I<br/>
was bothering you.&quot;<br/>
She apologized for bothering me. Adults apologize to teachers a  lot. What I<br/>
realized, and what we talked about, was that what I felt must have  been how<br/>
she felt when she was playing for her teacher as a child. She&#39;d be  intently<br/>
involved in her music-making when the teacher would yell and scare her.  In<br/>
the<br/>
present case, I was the teacher. I could get annoyed and tell her to  quit.<br/>
But when it happened to her, she was the child and the student. If she&#39;d<br/>
reacted to her teacher as I reacted to her, she would have been called rude<br/>
and<br/>
impudent and this particular teacher would have hit her. I&#39;ve seen this<br/>
woman<br/>
make a mistake and cover her head to ward off the impending blow.<br/>
How can a person be totally involved in their learning if they  are waiting<br/>
for someone to yell at them or hit them? A part of them must always  be<br/>
watching and waiting for the interruption or attack. I don&#39;t yell at my<br/>
students,<br/>
young or old.<br/>
The final irony of this sad tale is that the woman was her  teacher&#39;s best<br/>
student. She was working on Beethoven&#39;s Pathetique Sonata at the  age of 12.<br/>
Her<br/>
teacher had never had such a gifted student. Why did she feel the  need to<br/>
treat her student this way? People do not understand that being a  teacher&#39;s<br/>
best student can bring with it a number of disadvantages. Educational<br/>
problems<br/>
are always assumed to be the domain of lesser students, but there is a<br/>
whole<br/>
raft of problems the really good students experience. Teachers push them<br/>
too<br/>
fast and too far, beyond what they can really experience. Teachers become<br/>
possessive of the student and the student&#39;s accomplishment. Teachers<br/>
over-identify with their best students, especially if the former don&#39;t have<br/>
a  fulfilling<br/>
life of their own. Actually, this subject is a whole other talk.<br/>
The woman I&#39;m talking about is not an educational failure. She  has her<br/>
Ph.D.<br/>
and was president of a small Midwestern college for several years  before<br/>
taking lessons with me. She has achieved much in educational circles<br/>
including<br/>
power over teachers. Clearly this accomplishment has done nothing to  erase<br/>
the<br/>
impact of her childhood piano teacher. The power of this early  experience<br/>
is<br/>
tenacious. It will take time and work to move beyond the  experience.<br/>
Another example of the tenaciousness of this kind of abuse was  told by<br/>
another adult student of mine at the 10th anniversary celebration of the<br/>
Adult<br/>
Music Student Forum. Tom read the following: &quot;The man you see before you<br/>
now is<br/>
approaching his sixties. And yet, he can remember with stark clarity the<br/>
severe brutalization that he endured for nearly a full year when he was a<br/>
mere<br/>
slip of a lad in his second year of elementary school. This torture he<br/>
suffered<br/>
at the hands of none other than his piano teacher, one Sister Mary<br/>
Florentine.<br/>
&quot;Sister Mary Florentine&#39;s most notable trait as a music teacher  was a truly<br/>
remarkable intolerance for wrong notes. To say she was a stickler  for<br/>
perfection just doesn&#39;t fully capture it. During lessons she would usually<br/>
stand<br/>
behind and a little to the right of the student, gently cradling her  weapon<br/>
of<br/>
choice. That, of course, was the standard issue twelve-inch wooden  ruler<br/>
with<br/>
the embedded brass straightedge. She would position herself<br/>
strategically-just beyond the student&#39;s range of peripheral vision and just<br/>
within striking<br/>
distance of the keyboard.<br/>
&quot;Imagine yourself in this tableau-a young innocent boy, hands  poised just<br/>
above the keyboard with its hundreds of nicks and notches reflecting<br/>
decades of<br/>
wrong notes, each quickly followed by errant ruler strikes or  ricochets.<br/>
Imagine the strikes that found their intended targets. Imagine  yourself<br/>
playing<br/>
The Blue Danube Waltz in that situation.<br/>
&quot;Now fast forward about forty years. My family and career were  by now well<br/>
established. My life was on course and cruising along. Yet there  remained a<br/>
vague gnawing feeling in the pit of my stomach--something missing or<br/>
unresolved. It eventually evolved into a desire to take piano lessons.<br/>
&quot;My memory of the experience with Sister Mary Florentine formed  the basis<br/>
of<br/>
my expectations regarding lessons with Matt. For example, I  naturally<br/>
expected some form of torture to be an integral part of each lesson...<br/>
&quot;But even from the first lesson it was clear that Matt was no  Sister Mary<br/>
Florentine. For example, during lessons he seated himself  practically all<br/>
the<br/>
way across the room, way beyond striking range. Some of  Matt&#39;s<br/>
idiosyncrasies<br/>
were a little confusing at first. Consider his seating  arrangements-highly<br/>
varied and always interesting. When he conducted lessons  while seated on a<br/>
medicine ball, I found myself occasionally wondering how he  could throw the<br/>
medicine ball at me while he was seated on it. I feared there  might be some<br/>
trick.<br/>
My frame of reference did not permit me to imagine that he  might simply be<br/>
trying to ease his back pain.<br/>
&quot;I cannot say that any of his approaches was particularly  effective for me,<br/>
but all of them together seemed to have considerable benefit.  After two or<br/>
three years, I found myself actually focusing on the music. With  Matt&#39;s<br/>
continued teaching ... I found myself playing at least elementary pieces<br/>
with actual<br/>
enjoyment.&quot;<br/>
For Tom as the second-grader, getting right notes was not for  the joy of<br/>
the<br/>
sound, not for the joy of physical mastery, not for the joy of  learning.<br/>
Getting right notes was to keep from being hurt. What he learned was  not<br/>
about<br/>
music but about self-preservation. What he learned was that some  teachers<br/>
are<br/>
mean and will hurt you. Here success is not about feeling good  about<br/>
yourself; it&#39;s about being hit less.<br/>
Tom and I have been friends for at least ten years. I taught his  daughter<br/>
piano for some time. I had known her from birth. We would all go  Christmas<br/>
caroling every year together with other neighbors, then go back to  their<br/>
home for<br/>
Irish coffee. He knew the kind of person I am.<br/>
But this knowledge became irrelevant when Tom started taking  lessons. What<br/>
Tom knew of me could not erase the terror of his earlier  experience. The<br/>
history that was relevant was the horror of his earlier piano  lessons. When<br/>
I was<br/>
teaching Tom, I lost my identity to Sister Mary Florentine.  It took Tom two<br/>
or three years to actually focus on the music. It took that much  time to<br/>
undo<br/>
the meanness of his earlier teacher.<br/>
The tragedy is that people who are abused come to identify with  the abuser<br/>
and feel they should be abused; they deserve it. Compassion is hard  to<br/>
accept.<br/>
That&#39;s one of the reasons my adult students talk to themselves as  they do.<br/>
You may now better understand why I say what I try to do for my young<br/>
students<br/>
is to do no harm.<br/>
The yelling, hitting, and condescending nuances are all  humiliating and<br/>
embarrassing. This humiliation seems to be a common part of  everybody&#39;s<br/>
education. Everybody I&#39;ve talked to about what I planned to say  today has<br/>
his or her<br/>
own set of examples. They usually haven&#39;t thought to ponder  them, but<br/>
rather,<br/>
regarded them as an assumption of the whole process. Everybody  has<br/>
experienced this embarrassment. By high school the kids started doing the<br/>
same thing to<br/>
each other. One outcome of this is anger-fear and anger. I want to  return<br/>
to<br/>
this in a minute but first there seems to be a special humiliation we<br/>
experienced as students.<br/>
That humiliation came from thinking we were right when we were  wrong. The<br/>
teacher pulled the rug out from under us by telling us (and everybody  else)<br/>
that we were wrong, that we didn&#39;t have a clue, missed the whole point,<br/>
were<br/>
stupid or whatever. The implied corollary was &quot;pride goeth before a fall.&quot;<br/>
I<br/>
cannot get my adult students to say they played well. They think I&#39;m going<br/>
to<br/>
say their playing was awful. They think I&#39;m trying to set them up for this<br/>
embarrassment. They think that because it&#39;s happened to them before.<br/>
Recently, I had a student confess to thinking she played a piece  well for<br/>
me. There was something negative I wanted to point out so I knew I was  in<br/>
trouble. I tried to head it off but I failed. I said five things that were<br/>
truthful and positive about her performance. I said one thing needed work.<br/>
She  never<br/>
heard the five good things, only the one bad.<br/>
Everything I feared came pouring out. I&#39;d set her up; I&#39;d  embarrassed her;<br/>
I<br/>
was just trying to show her how little she knew compared to  me ... all of<br/>
it. What she said was that I was like all her other teachers, and  having a<br/>
Ph.D., she&#39;d had a lot of teachers. She was really angry with me and<br/>
embarrassed<br/>
by her anger. But she was angry and we talked about it and the  discussions<br/>
went on for probably three lessons. Neither one of us capitulated  but each<br/>
clarified what we&#39;d said and felt. Her anger freed something in her and  her<br/>
playing became significantly better in the week that followed. I&#39;ve had this<br/>
experience before. Release of anger at the teacher seems to free students to<br/>
invest themselves more fully. I don&#39;t fully understand this. Perhaps the<br/>
truthfulness of the anger and the teacher&#39;s acceptance of that anger allow<br/>
the  student<br/>
a deeper level of commitment.<br/>
My favorite story about anger at teachers is my own experience:<br/>
I took my one and only viola lesson a couple years ago with  Rodger<br/>
Ellsworth, the son of the man who ran Ellsworth Studio over on Willow  Lane.<br/>
The<br/>
difference was the teacher was my friend. Rodger dropped in one  evening<br/>
after a<br/>
performance at the Kennedy Center asking if I wanted a viola  lesson. I<br/>
said, &quot;Of<br/>
course not.&quot; In principle it was a fine idea but I had a  thousand reasons<br/>
for not wanting to do it. Rodger persisted, saying it would be  a good way<br/>
to<br/>
know what my adult students felt like and other such reasonable  nonsense. I<br/>
relented and took my first lesson. The result was not as I expected  at all.<br/>
Tensely, I put the viola under my chin and the bow in hand. I  started to<br/>
listen to his many instructions, some of which seemed contradictory  to me.<br/>
What<br/>
I didn&#39;t expect was I got really furious. I told him he didn&#39;t know  how to<br/>
teach; that I was going to take this viola and smash it over his head and<br/>
other<br/>
such violence. I was livid. Being the friend he was, Rodger was able to<br/>
accept all this, calmly.<br/>
When I finished my outburst and settled down I found I was  drawing the bow<br/>
over the strings with an ease and firmness I had not imagined  possible.<br/>
My outburst of anger apparently released my frustration at being  in an<br/>
awkward situation, feeling out of control, and feeling inferior. Having<br/>
discharged<br/>
that tension I was free to engage in the learning activity fully,  without<br/>
distraction. Rodger was a friend. I knew I could be angry with him. Had  I<br/>
been<br/>
working with a regular teacher, there would have been no such outburst. I<br/>
would have been the usual polite student. I would have been stuck with my<br/>
anger<br/>
and I would not have learned nearly as fast or as much. This is the position<br/>
of  most students.<br/>
I encourage my young students to vent their anger at music,  practicing, and<br/>
me. I let them know I am strong enough to take it and won&#39;t get  mad at them<br/>
for telling me. When it happens, and it&#39;s not often, I don&#39;t take  their<br/>
anger<br/>
personally. I don&#39;t feel they&#39;re being rude or impudent. I know that  to<br/>
really love something you have to have the freedom to sometimes hate it.<br/>
Another of my favorite stories is about Clare. This is an  example of what I<br/>
learned about teaching children from teaching adults. I was  ready and I<br/>
finally handled one of these situations right.<br/>
I was working with Clare, and it happened to be her 7th  birthday. She was<br/>
in<br/>
her second year of piano. Clare is fun, smart, honest, and  polite. She<br/>
played her piece for me with the right hand playing one note higher  than<br/>
written.<br/>
Instead of &quot;B&quot; she started on &quot;C,&quot; etc. Though it didn&#39;t sound  quite right,<br/>
it didn&#39;t sound too bad either. Clare thought it sounded fine. I  asked her<br/>
to<br/>
play the right hand one note lower, i.e. the correct way, and she  thought<br/>
that sounded weird. She played it again the wrong way and found it  better.<br/>
In<br/>
other words, she played wrong all week. Thinking she was right, she  was<br/>
pleased<br/>
with herself and her work.<br/>
I told Clare I hated to tell her but she played all the  right-hand notes<br/>
one<br/>
note too high. Clare was silent but her big brown eyes  filled with tears. I<br/>
apologized and told her I felt it was important to be  honest with her.<br/>
I asked her if she felt dumb and stupid and she said, &quot;Sort of.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Does it make you mad?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Sort of.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Do you feel it in your body anywhere?&quot;<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Well, do you feel it in your chest or stomach?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Both.&quot;<br/>
&quot;It hurts doesn&#39;t it?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Yeah.&quot;<br/>
Recently I asked Clare if I could tell this story in a talk I  was giving.<br/>
She said sure but she didn&#39;t remember the incident. To Clare, it was  not a<br/>
memorable event. That&#39;s exactly the way it should have been. Had I<br/>
unleashed any<br/>
of those lines teachers are famous for like &quot;How could you have  made that<br/>
same stupid mistake all week long? Do you ever look at the notes?,&quot; I  think<br/>
she&#39;d have remembered. She was already embarrassed by her mistake and her<br/>
assumption of correctness. What I did was to &quot;hold her hand&quot; while she got<br/>
in  touch<br/>
with how really rotten it did feel, right into her chest and stomach. With<br/>
both of us accepting all these feelings she could then let go of them and we<br/>
could move on.<br/>
What I&#39;ve learned from my adult students is how much our  education hurts,<br/>
how much we all suffered to get where we are, and how much  teachers&#39;<br/>
remembrance of their own history makes them repeat it rather than  correct<br/>
it. What I&#39;ve<br/>
learned is how rare is the consideration of students&#39;  feelings, not<br/>
withstanding some wonderful exceptions.<br/>
Most of all, I&#39;ve learned the value of compassion in education,  allowing<br/>
the<br/>
students the space to learn and know all the diverse emotions  involved in<br/>
learning. It&#39;s not dramatic; it&#39;s just kind. It doesn&#39;t call  attention to<br/>
itself; it does no harm.<br/>

I guess my definitions would be a rebel is someone who stands up for what they believe, no matter what popular opinion is...they follow their path regardless...they may fight for their beliefs if necessary...I would say violence is not always used, but can be to defend ones position when attacked...there are many I would consider &quot;rebels&quot; who were peaceful<br/>
<br/>
A terrorist would be someone who uses terror and violence to get what they want or have their beliefs dominate...terror is the tool for getting their way...violence is used as power, not as a defense<br/>

***** I finally got around to reading this article and it really hit <br/>
a chord with me about Laurie&#39;s college education. She did NOT care <br/>
about pleasing the professors. In fact, she debated with them <br/>
regularly. She had no problem telling them when she thought they <br/>
were wrong. She did it politely, but she had no motivation to sit <br/>
there and reverently take the professor god&#39;s word as gospel. She <br/>
didn&#39;t care if they liked her; she spoke her mind. Because of her <br/>
outspoken radical self, she did become really good friends with the <br/>
professors that I thought were stronger people than some of the <br/>
others. They wanted to be challenged and enjoyed having Laurie in <br/>
their classes. She kept it interesting and kept them on her toes. <br/>
Several times Laurie was asked to teach their classes when they had <br/>
car trouble or laryngitis. The weaker professors were intimidated <br/>
and angered by her comments. &lt;g&gt; But, I digress.<br/>
<br/>
Laurie does please the professors, but only because they are pleased <br/>
to have a student who actually loves learning. She has essays on her <br/>
computer that she wrote about class topics just for her own sake. No <br/>
one, but me, has ever seen them. She&#39;ll take what she learns in <br/>
class and run with it. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Kelly, (I think) for posting this. It really hits home <br/>
with why Laurie loves college so much; she&#39;s doing it for herself <br/>
and not to please anyone else. <br/>
<br/>
love, Valerie<br/>

two new born kittens,,and dad,kids,and inlaws went to CI_CI&#39;s for dinner,,<br/>
his brother asks my soon to be 15 yr.old ,,son,what 1/8th of a ton was ,,heck <br/>
i dont even know right off the top of my head,,nor,,,do i care,,neither did <br/>
my husband,anyway,,,his brother also goes and tells my son that tthere were <br/>
some teenagers in the game room,,for him to go talk to them,..,my son told him he <br/>
didnt need his help,,,he has&#39;nt,ever been hugely extrovert..but he does <br/>
manage <br/>
fine with kids his age,,so,,im not worried about it.....<br/>
neither his brother,,or mom,, will  not  start anything with or around  <br/>
me,only around..the kids,and, hubby,,and last nite he was tired,,and the mental <br/>
crap doesnt help him any,,,he&#39;s better,but it still is exausting sometimes,,soo <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi June. Hopefully I&#39;ll meet you in Pensacola in November? :-)<br/>
Ah, the grandparents and other relatives. They always know what&#39;s <br/>
best for our kids, don&#39;t they? <br/>
<br/>
Laurie&#39;s grandparents and other relatives questioned her too, but <br/>
they loved doing it in front of me to make a point (that Laurie was <br/>
not learning what THEY thought she should). A school teacher aunt <br/>
once asked young Laurie a schoolish question and Laurie told her <br/>
that she wasn&#39;t interested in that right now. It took my aunt by <br/>
surprise. She expected Laurie to stammer and stutter and say that <br/>
she didn&#39;t know. She expected Laurie to be intimidated. The <br/>
word &quot;intimidated&quot; wasn&#39;t in Laurie&#39;s dictionary. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One thing I notice is that the older generation questions ALL <br/>
children about what they know, not just the unschoolers. When they <br/>
question them, they seem to purposefully avoid questions about what <br/>
the children are interested in. They want to broaden their horizons <br/>
maybe? Dad used to question Laurie about science and cosmology. He&#39;d <br/>
question me about quantum physics - that didn&#39;t take long. <br/>
<br/>
My parents have ostracized all of their grandchildren, not just <br/>
Laurie. They disapprove of anything done differently from the way <br/>
they do/did it. Laurie graduating summa cum laude means nothing to <br/>
them; the fact that her eyebrow was pierced in her graduation <br/>
picture meant that pic went straight to the bottom drawer and won&#39;t <br/>
ever be displayed with the other family pics. <br/>
<br/>
When relatives started testing Laurie, I watched her to see if she <br/>
wanted to deal with it. She knew that if she gave me &quot;the look,&quot; I <br/>
would step in and tell the tester (if it was a stranger) that what <br/>
Laurie knows is Laurie&#39;s business and no one elses. If it was a <br/>
relative that I like and see regularly, I would start a conversation <br/>
around the question. For instance, &quot;How much is 1/8 ton?&quot; I&#39;d <br/>
say, &quot;Wow, do people really weigh things like that? I&#39;d think if you <br/>
got down to 1/8 of a ton, you&#39;d use pounds, unless you&#39;re an <br/>
elephant.&quot; My interruption would take them offguard, but if they <br/>
said they were directing the question to Laurie, I&#39;d say, &quot;I&#39;m sure <br/>
you could find the answer online if you don&#39;t know it.&quot; (a PERFECT <br/>
line for nosy testers, no matter what the topic is). I&#39;d keep on <br/>
them until my point was made. <br/>
<br/>
If it was a relative that I REALLY liked, then I would explain to <br/>
them the concept of unschooling, not testing, natural learning, etc <br/>
until they were ready to run screaming from the room. Those same <br/>
relatives haven&#39;t acknowledged my book. lol <br/>
<br/>
Your son handled it well, by telling his uncle that he didn&#39;t need <br/>
his help. Maybe you could talk to the uncle and grandparents and <br/>
explain to them that you will not allow them to test your son. Tell <br/>
them that it upsets your husband and that he doesn&#39;t need that kind <br/>
of stress. If they choose to ignore you, then it&#39;s up to you and <br/>
your children as to whether or not they visit there again. Laurie <br/>
doesn&#39;t go to my parents anymore, and my visits are short and <br/>
infrequent. I don&#39;t need the stress either. <br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t change the testers, but you can tell them how you feel and <br/>
not allow them to test your kids. You might be afraid of causing <br/>
tension, but the tension is already there. They&#39;re causing it and <br/>
they should have to deal with it. Your children are doing nothing <br/>
wrong and the testers are making them (or attempting to make them) <br/>
feel stupid.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had peers tell me that I need to put aside my disappointment <br/>
with the attitude of my parents; stop being angry with them for <br/>
their beliefs because they are old, etc. Well, I&#39;m not angry with <br/>
them; it was only hurting me. I&#39;m disappointed in them, but I keep <br/>
it to myself around them. I bite my tongue ALOT around them. They <br/>
know nothing about me or Laurie and that&#39;s how they like it. We <br/>
visit and discuss whatever they want to discuss (and it&#39;s NEVER <br/>
about unschooling, my book or anything real). Tempers stay low and I <br/>
leave asap. I hug them, tell them I love them and do my head-shaking <br/>
after I&#39;m out of sight. It&#39;s easier to do now that Laurie is an <br/>
adult and they can see she&#39;s doing quite well in life.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s okay for you to stand up for your kids against their relatives. <br/>
It&#39;s okay for you to protect them from nosy testers. Practice what <br/>
you&#39;ll say to them and try to remain calm while saying it. The <br/>
calmer you can stay, the more light-hearted you can be and the more <br/>
confidence you can exude in a mature voice...the more seriously you <br/>
will be taken. If your children can respond to their questions with <br/>
a sense of humor and say &quot;I&#39;m sure you can find that online if you <br/>
don&#39;t know the answer,&quot; it&#39;ll be easier for the kids. If the <br/>
children get angry with the questions, then the testers will win. <br/>
The main reason they&#39;re testing is to prove that unschooling <br/>
doesn&#39;t &quot;work.&quot; Your son getting angry would prove that to THEM. For <br/>
some reason adults enjoy making teens angry. Sadistic (*@&#$)*&#%(<br/>
<br/>
Give your kids some ammo. Tell them not to let the testers <br/>
intimidate them. When Laurie was in her late teens and my parents <br/>
would test her, she&#39;d just laugh and walk away shaking her head. <br/>
They eventually quit asking. Now when they ask her something, she <br/>
responds with such a large vocabulary that my mom just looks <br/>
confused. She can&#39;t understand what Laurie&#39;s saying. I promise, I <br/>
don&#39;t laugh aloud. &lt;g&gt;  I once saw my Dad consult his dictionary <br/>
after he talked to Laurie. I have a feeling he was trying to prove <br/>
her wrong, but she wasn&#39;t. (more silent giggles from me) God, I&#39;m a <br/>
snobby sort at times. <br/>
<br/>
I hope I helped. I fear I rambled.<br/>
<br/>
love, Valerie<br/>
