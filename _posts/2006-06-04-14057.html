<div id="ygrps-yiv-1681477879">Don&#39;t worry, Beth. I&#39;m with you on this one! *But*, I don&#39;t consider it a<br/>
matter of intelligence or lack of ability, just a difference in personality<br/>
and interests. My husband and oldest daughter can get into these kinds of<br/>
discussions about words (or philosophy or religion) and thrive on it....me?<br/>
I just shake my head and let them have their fun.  It&#39;s not my idea of fun<br/>
and that&#39;s OK. I&#39;ve learned to engage in some dialog with them along this<br/>
line because it&#39;s important to them, but mostly, they find other<br/>
like-minded people to carry on with. I would never minimize or devalue what<br/>
they do and like and I respect their ability to discuss such things.<br/>
However,  I have other strengths and abilities that they find equally<br/>
unfathomable. (I can sense someones moods and emotions and can &#39;read&#39; people<br/>
well, something they just can&#39;t do).  Different kinds of intelligences. It&#39;s<br/>
what makes this world so grand to be in.  And it&#39;s what makes my life never<br/>
dull!!<br/>

 I&#39;m starting a new note rather than responding to anyone. I just<br/>
 want to say that you people are deep!!<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 These lists have been accused of that before! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  But I think that that&#39;s a big part of unschooling---we question. <br/>
Everything.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-==-<br/>
<br/>
 One of the issues<br/>
 I&#39;m still working through in my life is that I feel less intelligent<br/>
 than most people I come across.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t feel that I&#39;m *less* intelligent than most people I come <br/>
across. I do know, though, that the people I tend to hang out with, the <br/>
ones I put effort into getting to know better and spend time <br/>
with---those people are almost always more intelligent than I am. It&#39;s <br/>
just more fun to be around smart people! They keep me hoppin&#39;! &lt;g&gt; and <br/>
thinkin&#39;! I just prefer their company (and y&#39;all know who you are! <br/>
&lt;bwg&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I know it&#39;s a perception but this<br/>
 thread is just another of the many examples that I come across in my<br/>
 life that leave my head spinning. I can&#39;t fathom a 2 year old being<br/>
 able to cogitate the meaning of one small 3-letter word in such a<br/>
 deeply disturbing way. I&#39;m absolutely floored at the way this word<br/>
 is being perceived and I&#39;m truly frightened to ever use it again.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  I think it&#39;s good to think at the lowest common denominator AND the <br/>
highest at the same time. You can never be 100% positive the other <br/>
person is getting it at the same level *you* are---no matter what you <br/>
say. A two year old could understand *deeply*---OR it could go right <br/>
over his head. Same for a 46 year old too! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=--=<br/>
<br/>
 And if most people truly think like that, then no wonder I feel so<br/>
 dumb most of the time and have few friends.<br/>
<br/>
 =-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  I certainly don&#39;t think *most* people think that way. Not by a long <br/>
shot. If so, we unschoolers wouldn&#39;t be in the minority! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
 I really love<br/>
 unschooling and honoring my children for who they are, but it&#39;s<br/>
 times like these that make me want to go back to a traditional<br/>
 homeschooling method because my children would be instructed by<br/>
 something else other than me. I really hate the idea that I may<br/>
 have caused my children pain by my not understanding how to<br/>
 communicate more effectively.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  And you think *our* kids haven&#39;t felt pain due to our mistakes? We <br/>
apologize. We learn from them. We try to do better the next time. We DO <br/>
better the next time.<br/>
<br/>
  We&#39;re all learning. Some learn faster than others. Some get it even <br/>
before having children (amazing! &lt;g&gt;). Others of us follow the crowd <br/>
for years before finding a new path. It&#39;s different for each of us. But <br/>
none of us were raised with this philosophy: we all had to figure it <br/>
out ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
 Patience. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t want to learn. It&#39;s just that I feel<br/>
 extremely overwhelmed.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  I understand. But it really gets easier each time you make the effort. <br/>
Each time you break through!<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 A couple of years ago, this type of thread<br/>
 would have had me in tears and I would have left the group in a<br/>
 huff. Yes, I&#39;ve BTDT.<br/>
 -=-=-=-=--<br/>
<br/>
 Yes, but see how far you&#39;ve come already????? &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 But now I recognize that this is a challenge<br/>
 for improvement within myself, yet I&#39;m feeling more dumb the more I<br/>
 think about this. *chuckle*<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  How &#39;bout feeling that you&#39;ve come a long way? That you&#39;re making the <br/>
changes you want to see? That you&#39;ve achieved a lot already and that <br/>
you only want MORE of the same?<br/>
<br/>
  A lot of this unschooling stuff is about perception. About looking at <br/>
things in a *very* different way. About changing the way we act and <br/>
react.<br/>
<br/>
  It&#39;s not easy! But the harder you *think* about it and work to make <br/>
those changes, the easier it gets.<br/>
<br/>
 Promise! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

  &quot;The hardest problem for the brain is not learning, but forgetting. No <br/>
matter how hard we try, we can&#39;t deliberately forget something we have <br/>
learned, and that is catastrophic if we learn that we can&#39;t learn.&quot; <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s that people learn quickly how to make excuses.  &quot;I hurt you but you<br/>
had it coming.&quot; in it&#39;s various forms is what most kids hear from their<br/>
parents.   &quot;(fill in blank) ...but I told you to be careful,&quot;  or &quot;(fill<br/>
in blank)... but you didn&#39;t listen.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
***I&#39;m absolutely floored at the way this word <br/>
is being perceived and I&#39;m truly frightened to ever use it again.***<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s something to think about but not a thing to strike terror into your<br/>
heart.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
***I really hate the idea that I may <br/>
have caused my children pain by my not understanding how to <br/>
communicate more effectively. ***<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve all said things that hurt our kids.  We don&#39;t have to keep saying<br/>
it once we know it can hurt.   It&#39;s better to figure it out sooner rather<br/>
than later.    If your partner accidentally smacked you and then said<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m sorry I hit you but you shouldn&#39;t have been in my way&quot;   It probably<br/>
wouldn&#39;t make you feel like that person was really sorry.   : (<br/>
<br/>
***I feel less intelligent than most people I come across. ***<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s rough.  Have you thought about counseling?   Life is bumpy enough<br/>
without you building your own obstacles. &lt;g&gt; Being kinder to yourself and<br/>
feeling more confident will benefit your kids, too. <br/>
