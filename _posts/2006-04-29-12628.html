<div id="ygrps-yiv-29208391">&quot;! What I was saying is that emotions can and many times do increase <br/>
during puberty. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Absolutely.  I&#39;m not trying to ignore the fact that hormones are<br/>
stronger and more fluctuating for some people during that time. I just<br/>
think it&#39;s not a good idea to brush off intense emotions as &quot;puberty&quot;<br/>
without looking very deeply at how the parents are handling issues.<br/>
<br/>
Especially for a child that had extremely damaging experiences, just<br/>
left school recently and is not unschooling yet!! Yeah, there&#39;s<br/>
probably some pubescent angst adding fuel to the fire, but there&#39;s<br/>
probably a lot of old hurt that needs to be worked through also.<br/>
One day at a time.....:)<br/>

  I certainly do not think our son is rebellious, I don&#39;t think of him <br/>
as submisive or compliant either. I just don&#39;t think of people like <br/>
that at all.  <br/>
I do think he is becoming moodyier, which is to say his moods are not <br/>
on an even keel as often as before and I think he has started <br/>
destressing and is finaly realizing that he has more space.<br/>
I do think he is &quot;getting out&quot; some toxic stuff emotionaly as well <br/>
(and his counceler agrees).<br/>
 I wouldnt say it is totaly unexpected but diferent amd more dificult <br/>
than any of us thought it would be.<br/>
 One or the other is hard enough to deal with but both at the same <br/>
time is like a double whammy. (for the whole family) And we are all <br/>
trying to find our way through it and we are all (the whole family) <br/>
trying to do our best.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  IMO no one ever sets our to do less than their best, we all need the <br/>
right frame of mind and the right tools and the right people around us <br/>
to ultimatly do our best in a situation like this.</div>

<br/>
But I wasn&#39;t trying to find stuff to fit your situation...just adding<br/>
to a discussion about moods and puberty, that&#39;s all.:)<br/>
Very often, the original poster asks a question and the discussion<br/>
spins off in a lot of directions not expected. That&#39;s the beauty of<br/>
discussion....it just sort of flows and fills in and helps other folks<br/>
that might not even be posting.<br/>
<br/>
Connections, connections....just like real life.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I wanted to add to this.  Try replacing the words intense emotions <br/>
with intense pain, for a moment. You would probably do everything <br/>
you could to minimize someone&#39;s pain and look for any underlying <br/>
causes ASAP.  While we might believe that the hormonal emotions will <br/>
eventually subside on their own, the person experiencing them for <br/>
the moment needs all the support they can get.  Emotions have a way <br/>
of imprinting themselves on the body, whether they are in passing <br/>
due to hormones or other stresses in life.   I believe that any <br/>
emotion/pain should be handled with the greatest care, regardless of <br/>
its source.  It also disturbs me when I hear, &quot;Oh, it&#39;s just a <br/>
hormone thing.&quot;<br/>
