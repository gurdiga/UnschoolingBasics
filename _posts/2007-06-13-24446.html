<div id="ygrps-yiv-657288097">Most cities have laws that you can shoot a stray animal on your <br/>
property if it is HARMING or at risk of harming someone. But for him <br/>
to chase it down and shoot it in your yard is probably illegal.<br/>
<br/>
Why did he do this? Did he say it attacked him, or did he just do it <br/>
for fun? If you don&#39;t mind my asking, why do you live so close to him <br/>
if this is something that is &quot;okay&quot; to him?<br/>
<br/>
I personally wouldn&#39;t worry about a fence or rose hedge to keep <br/>
animals out... I&#39;d be more worried about your borther in law getting <br/>
in.<br/>
<br/>
What if it was dark and what he THOUGHT was another stray dog was a <br/>
child? Scary....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2118563809">Thanks for the ideas.  I did a smudging...I think that&#39;s the right <br/>
word...this afternoon, and it has helped tremendously.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s exactly what I was thinking. I&#39;d have called the cops<br/>
IMMEDIATELY. He sounds awful. Surely there are ordinances about<br/>
chasing a dog down to shoot it....doesn&#39;t sound like he was being<br/>
threatened by the animal in any way. What a creep. I&#39;d have pressed<br/>
charges. Shooting a gun in my yard? HELL yes I&#39;d press charges. How scary.<br/>
