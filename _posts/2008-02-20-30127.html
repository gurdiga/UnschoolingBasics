Yes this was the second source I used to check the law in FL before I<br/>
pulled the boys out.  And it&#39;s even more threatening with the yearly<br/>
evals etc...it doesn&#39;t sound like it&#39;s a *might happen* to me.  So<br/>
what&#39;s the real deal?<br/>

<br/>
(1) A &quot;home education program&quot; is defined in s 1 002.01. The parent is<br/>
not required to hold a valid regular Florida teaching certificate.<br/>
<br/>
(a) The parent shall notify the district school superintendent of the<br/>
county in which the parent resides of her or his intent to establish<br/>
and maintain a home education program. The notice shall be in writing,<br/>
signed by the parent, and shall include the names, addresses, and<br/>
birth dates of all children who shall be enrolled as students in the<br/>
home education program. The notice shall be filed in the district<br/>
school superintendent&#39;s office within 30 days of the establishment of<br/>
the home education program. A written notice of termination of the<br/>
home education program shall be filed in the district school<br/>
superintendent&#39;s office within 30 days after said termination.<br/>
<br/>
(b) The parent shall maintain a portfolio of records and materials.<br/>
The portfolio shall consist of the following:<br/>
<br/>
1. A log of educational activities that is made contemporaneously with<br/>
the instruction and that designates by title any reading materials<br/>
used.<br/>
<br/>
2. Samples of any writings, worksheets, workbooks, or creative<br/>
materials used or developed by the student. The portfolio shall be<br/>
preserved by the parent for 2 years and shall be made available for<br/>
inspection by the district school superintendent, or the district<br/>
school superintendent&#39;s agent, upon 15 days&#39; written notice. Nothing<br/>
in this section shall require the district school superintendent to<br/>
inspect the portfolio.<br/>
<br/>
(c) The parent shall provide for an annual educational evaluation in<br/>
which is documented the student&#39;s demonstration of educational<br/>
progress at a level commensurate with her or his ability. The parent<br/>
shall select the method of evaluation and shall file a copy of the<br/>
evaluation annually with the district school superintendent&#39;s office<br/>
in the county in which the student resides. The annual educational<br/>
evaluation shall consist of one of the following:<br/>
<br/>
1. A teacher selected by the parent shall evaluate the student&#39;s<br/>
educational progress upon review of the portfolio and discussion with<br/>
the student. Such teacher shall hold a valid regular Florida<br/>
certificate to teach academic subjects at the elementary or secondary<br/>
level;<br/>
<br/>
2. The student shall take any nationally normed student achievement<br/>
test administered by a certified teacher;<br/>
<br/>
3. The student shall take a state student assessment test used by the<br/>
school district and administered by a certified teacher, at a location<br/>
and under testing conditions approved by the school district;<br/>
<br/>
4. The student shall be evaluated by an individual holding a valid,<br/>
active license pursuant to the provisions of s. 490.003(7) or (8); or<br/>
<br/>
5. The student shall be evaluated with any other valid measurement<br/>
tool as mutually agreed upon by the district school superintendent of<br/>
the district in which the student resides and the student&#39;s parent.<br/>
<br/>
(2) The district school superintendent shall review and accept the<br/>
results of the annual educational evaluation of the student in a home<br/>
education program. If the student does not demonstrate educational<br/>
progress at a level commensurate with her or his ability, the district<br/>
school superintendent shall notify the parent, in writing, that such<br/>
progress has not been achieved. The parent shall have 1 year from the<br/>
date of receipt of the written notification to provide remedial<br/>
instruction to the student. At the end of the 1-year probationary<br/>
period, the student shall be reevaluated as specified in paragraph (1<br/>
)(c). Continuation in a home education program shall be contingent<br/>
upon the student demonstrating educational progress commensurate with<br/>
her or his ability at the end of the probationary period.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1277974004">hello from another former Floridian.....<br/>
<br/>
We unschooled with my daughter starting in &#39;91(she&#39;s now 21, in &#39;08), mailed <br/>
in our simple little intent form, and found a teacher we really liked by <br/>
putting an ad in our local (Tallahassee) newspaper that used buzzwords like &#39;Holt, <br/>
childled learning, etc...&#39;. We kept a sortof scrapbook of Bonnies artsy <br/>
things, lots of photos, brochures from theatre gigs, things a parent might keep <br/>
anyway. Once a year we chose some fun place, like Blue Springs, and met Jo for a <br/>
family picnic. We talked, swam, played games, hiked, just generally visited. <br/>
The option exists for teachers to use a very simple form or write a letter if <br/>
they are more inclined. It was a really simple and fun choice for our family, we <br/>
never had any fallout during all the years we unschooled. <br/>
Bonnie still writes to Jo once in a while.<br/>
