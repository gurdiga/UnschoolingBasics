<div id="ygrps-yiv-1800274596">I reorganized the site, now the lifestyle page is about rights, <br/>
activism, news, organizations, other while the life page is about <br/>
parenting and sustenance. <br/>
<br/>
This is to let people know in case they&#39;re wondering where the <br/>
family topics went.</div>
