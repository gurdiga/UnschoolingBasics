<br/>
Kelli called Rue this morning, to distraught to talk much, but let her<br/>
know that Hannah passed away around 2am this morning. Her poor little<br/>
body just couldn&#39;t handle any more.<br/>
<br/>
I am at a loss for words right now.  Please take some time to send<br/>
your love to the Jenner family, in thought or words. Thank you.<br/>
