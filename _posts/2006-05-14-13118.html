wanted to do it herself.  Once I resigned myself to letting her do that it<br/>
wasn&#39;t a problem.  The waterBaby sunscreen that comes in a stick was helpful<br/>
for that.  Towards the end of the summer we found the baby blanket sunscreen<br/>
it comes in a packet with towlettes or wipes full of sunscreen it makes it<br/>
very quick and easy to apply.<br/>

We just recently went to DisneyWorld and while we where there  i discovered <br/>
the coppertone spray sunscreen.  They make a kids one and all  you do is spray <br/>
it on them.  No rubbing no nothing just spray and go so  quick and easy.  I <br/>
would recommend this kind to anyone.  <br/>
