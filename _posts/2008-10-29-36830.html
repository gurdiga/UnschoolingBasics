<div id="ygrps-yiv-411557565">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the cross-post. I want to make sure this gets out to all my lists.<br/>
I think many of you know this book, and have benefitted from it. I&#39;d love to<br/>
see it remain available for future parents/children. It would be a shame for<br/>
it to go out of print.<br/>

Thanks!<br/>

PEACEFUL PARENTS, PEACEFUL KIDS <br/>
 <br/>
Dear Friends, <br/>
I know that many of you have read and loved &quot;Peaceful Parents, <br/>
Peaceful Kids.&quot; Nothing makes me happier than knowing this book has <br/>
helped so many people navigate their way through parenthood. A mom who <br/>
attended my workshop in Florida last week told me this was the most <br/>
life-changing parenting book she had ever read. <br/>
 <br/>
Well, I just learned &quot;Peaceful Parents, Peaceful Kids,&quot; is in danger <br/>
of going out of print. Its publisher, Kensington Books, said that <br/>
unless sales improve, &quot;Peaceful Parents, Peaceful Kids&quot; will be put to <br/>
bed forever.  This can&#39;t happen. So many workshops are scheduled <br/>
around the content in &quot;Peaceful Parents, Peaceful Kids&quot; and so many <br/>
parents are still waiting to read it. <br/>
 <br/>
Please consider giving &quot;Peaceful Parents, Peaceful Kids&quot; as a gift, <br/>
or donating a copy to your local school, parent group, or religious <br/>
education program.  The recipient will be grateful, as have been the <br/>
many parents who have benefited from this book since it&#39;s birth in <br/>
2000. I hope that with your help, &quot;Peaceful Parents, Peaceful Kids&quot; <br/>
will make it to its tenth birthday and beyond. <br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Peaceful Parents, Peaceful Kids&quot; is available at Amazon.com for only <br/>
$11.20. Here is the exact link. <br/>

Below is an adapted excerpt from &quot;Peaceful Parents, Peaceful Kids&quot; on <br/>
tantrums that I know many of you will find helpful. As my way of <br/>
saying thanks to anyone who buys the book, I want to send you a signed <br/>
book plate for the inside cover. E-mail me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Naomi@...">Naomi@...</a> <br/>
for details. <br/>
 <br/>
Thank you, as always for your support.  You generously responded when <br/>
I asked for people to participate in my national survey of <br/>
elementary-aged kids on conflict, anger, and bullying.  As a result <br/>
over 2100 students and hundreds of teachers took part.  As soon as I <br/>
get the go-ahead from Free Spirit Publishing, I will share with you <br/>
the complete results.  However, as loyal readers, I&#39;d like you to know <br/>
the one result that most stood out for me: <br/>
 <br/>
73% percent of the students surveyed think other kids are somewhat to <br/>
very mean to each other. <br/>
 <br/>
This is why the work of peacemaking has to continue in our homes, <br/>
school, communities, and in the world at large.  I am so grateful you <br/>
are all a part of it. <br/>
 <br/>
In peace, Naomi <br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
FROM &quot;PEACEFUL PARENTS, PEACEFUL KIDS:&quot; <br/>
DEALING WITH TANTRUMS <br/>
 <br/>
What parent doesn&#39;t dread tantrums?  Well, here&#39;s some good news <br/>
--you can alleviate much of the chaos brought on by tantrums by <br/>
identifying what kind tantrum you child is having: manipulative or <br/>
spill-over. <br/>
 <br/>
A manipulative tantrum is the kind kids use to get their way. These <br/>
tantrums often take place when your child wants something and you say <br/>
no. Your child then throws a fit to force you to change your mind.  A <br/>
spill-over tantrum is an entirely different thing.  Spill-over <br/>
tantrums happen when a child becomes overwhelmed by feelings, senses, <br/>
and stimuli. These tantrums are unintentional. They usually happen <br/>
when kids are over-tired or hungry.  Children who are highly <br/>
emotional, ultra-sensitive, and easily over-stimulated tend to have <br/>
spill-over tantrums. <br/>
 <br/>
Both types of tantrums need to be handled differently. <br/>
 <br/>
The first step is to determine which type of tantrum your child is <br/>
having. If she&#39;s yelling and screaming because you won&#39;t let her have <br/>
ice cream, it&#39;s probably a manipulative tantrum. Best to ignore it. <br/>
Walk into another room and let her emote without the benefit of an <br/>
audience. If you&#39;re out, take your child to the car and let her scream <br/>
there. Most importantly, don&#39;t give in or you&#39;ll just encourage <br/>
another tantrum next time she wants her way. After the tantrum&#39;s over, <br/>
explain, in no uncertain terms, that her behavior was unacceptable, <br/>
then give a consequence like taking away a special toy for at least a <br/>
day, or removing a privilege. <br/>
 <br/>
Tell your child that you expect better of her and that you were <br/>
disappointed in her behavior.  Use a no-nonsense non-yelling voice and <br/>
make direct eye contact. Remember, you&#39;re the model for your child&#39;s <br/>
behavior. One more caveat. If you say you&#39;re going to take away a toy <br/>
if your child throws another tantrum, be sure to do it. Backing off <br/>
will only reinforce manipulation. <br/>
 <br/>
Spill-over tantrums are entirely different. Your child may be caught <br/>
in the pattern of feeling overwhelmed and losing control without <br/>
wanting to. Let&#39;s say it&#39;s been a stressful week and he&#39;s has had a <br/>
long and over-stimulating day. It&#39;s past his bedtime, and as he walks <br/>
toward his bed he accidentally knocks over a Lego airplane he just <br/>
made. He starts wailing uncontrollably and before long, he&#39;s <br/>
completely out of control. This is a spill-over tantrum. Here are a <br/>
few suggestions for handling it: <br/>
 <br/>
- Try to rectify the source of the problem if at all possible. In <br/>
this case, helping him put together his broken airplane might do the <br/>
trick <br/>
. <br/>
- Stay close by. Let your presence be a calming influence. Sometimes <br/>
leaving the room will add to your child&#39;s upset, so take some deep <br/>
breaths and try to keep your own composure. <br/>
 <br/>
- Touch your child gently if he allows it. Try hugging or stroking <br/>
him. Let him put his head in your lap or lean against you; whisper <br/>
soothing words to him like, &quot;Mommy&#39;s right here. You&#39;re going to be <br/>
OK.&quot; Try to remain calm even if he keeps wailing. <br/>
 <br/>
- Ask him to stop after about five minutes. Have him take a series of <br/>
slow, deep breaths to regain his composure. Breathe together if you <br/>
can. Offering a distraction might help too. &quot;Let&#39;s go downstairs and <br/>
get a nice cool drink.&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
- Don&#39;t allow your child to do anything destructive during his <br/>
tantrum, no matter how upset he is. Make sure he knows ahead of time <br/>
what&#39;s acceptable and what isn&#39;t. Hurting himself, others, or property <br/>
are not okay. <br/>
 <br/>
Talk afterwards and help your child identify the feelings that <br/>
brought on his tantrum. Together come up with a  plan for next time. <br/>
Ask him to let you know when he&#39;s feeling overtired or in need of a <br/>
break. Be aware of situations that could trigger him. <br/>
 <br/>
If you do all this and the spill-over tantrums continue, try keeping <br/>
a journal and noting what tends to set your child off. Most of all, <br/>
don&#39;t lose hope.  This is probably a stage that will end as quickly as <br/>
it came on.  We&#39;ve all been there. <br/>

but if they&#39;ll let her publish it on her own -- an agent could help  <br/>
with the contract stuff -- the vanity presses are a lot better than  <br/>
they used to be. They can print even single copies for a reasonable  <br/>
price. Lulu has been around awhile and Sandra Dodd used them and I  <br/>
think Rue Kream too. They will also handle the sales through their  <br/>
website if she doesn&#39;t want to buy a bunch of copies and do it herself.<br/>

Create Space is an Amazon owned company and they&#39;ll print and also  <br/>
help market it through Amazon.<br/>

(Lulu also publishes kid creations like books and comic books which  <br/>
my daughter would have *loved* when she was a kid :-) She desperately  <br/>
wanted real bound copies of her creations. Stapling and comb binding  <br/>
didn&#39;t cut it. She wanted it to look and feel like it came from a  <br/>
store. That desire did, though, get us into book binding later. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of books going out of print. the New York Times had an  <br/>
article about Google&#39;s scanning efforts.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/29/technology/internet/29google.html?">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/29/technology/internet/29google.html?</a> <br/>
_r=1&th&emc=th&oref=slogin<br/>
<br/>
They were sued for scanning out of print copyrighted material and  <br/>
reached an agreement with authors and publishers that will allow them  <br/>
to continue to scan and offer about 20% of the book to browse with an  <br/>
option to purchase it as a download (with part of the sale going to  <br/>
the author and publisher). What a great thing for books that are  <br/>
barely available as used copies. I see so many interesting-but-not- <br/>
great books being sold for exorbitant prices on Amazon only because  <br/>
they&#39;re out of print.<br/>

Surely this is the antithesis of RU no?  Is the rest of the book RU or<br/>
is it strewn with advice like this?  I have a friend who is interested<br/>
in this life and her kids really need her to relax...I am going to<br/>
give her Rue&#39;s book and I thought about giving this one as well but<br/>
this is exactly the kind of thing she doesn&#39;t need reinforced as OK.<br/>

Can anyone offer insight?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1734718136">Yes, there&#39;s some stuff in here I wouldn&#39;t advocate, but there&#39;s also some<br/>
excellent ideas that are truly respectful. I&#39;m thinking that if someone<br/>
makes it as far as unschooling in the first place, they&#39;re thinking outside<br/>
the box enough to separate the good from the bad. It&#39;s more of a stepping<br/>
stone book than one I would consider a foundational book. But I happen to<br/>
know a lot of parents who read about respectful parenting in this book first<br/>
(I think it&#39;s the title that catches people&#39;s eye) and have really soared<br/>
into this as a way of life. I hesitated when they chose that excerpt to<br/>
highlight, but I consider the readers on the groups I&#39;m on to be a smart<br/>
bunch of people :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-629260363">I do not own Ms. Drew&#39;s book, but I have flipped through it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Although it may be a step in the right direction for mainstream, traditional parents, it has LOTS of bad advice from an unschooling/peaceful/mindful/gentle parenting point of view. I wouldn&#39;t recommend it to parents who are looking to actually BE peaceful parents.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In the example she chooses to highlight, she refers to a child as &quot;manipulative&quot; and she advises taking away a prized toy as punishment (but she uses the the common euphemism, &quot;consequence&quot;). I don&#39;t like the idea that my child is trying to be &quot;manipulative&quot; when he has so few tools to deal with his environment as it is. You&#39;d think an adult parent would have more tools than simply ignoring the child and taking away a special toy---talk about MANIPULATIVE!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A &quot;tantrum&quot; is a form of communication. If the parent has been so oblivious to the child&#39;s attempt to communicate that the child must resort to &quot;tantrumming&quot;, whose fault is THAT?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Rue&#39;s book paints a much better picture of how I would want my relationship with my children to look. I would pay BIG bucks to keep Rue Kream&#39;s book in print.<br/>

Sorry for the cross-post. I want to make sure this gets out to all my lists.<br/>
I think many of you know this book, and have benefitted from it. I&#39;d love to<br/>
see it remain available for future parents/children. It would be a shame for<br/>
it to go out of print.<br/>

PEACEFUL PARENTS, PEACEFUL KIDS <br/>
 <br/>
Dear Friends, <br/>
I know that many of you have read and loved &quot;Peaceful Parents, <br/>
Peaceful Kids.&quot; Nothing makes me happier than knowing this book has <br/>
helped so many people navigate their way through parenthood. A mom who <br/>
attended my workshop in Florida last week told me this was the most <br/>
life-changing parenting book she had ever read. <br/>
 <br/>
Well, I just learned &quot;Peaceful Parents, Peaceful Kids,&quot; is in danger <br/>
of going out of print. Its publisher, Kensington Books, said that <br/>
unless sales improve, &quot;Peaceful Parents, Peaceful Kids&quot; will be put to <br/>
bed forever.  This can&#39;t happen. So many workshops are scheduled <br/>
around the content in &quot;Peaceful Parents, Peaceful Kids&quot; and so many <br/>
parents are still waiting to read it. <br/>
 <br/>
Please consider giving &quot;Peaceful Parents, Peaceful Kids&quot; as a gift, <br/>
or donating a copy to your local school, parent group, or religious <br/>
education program.  The recipient will be grateful, as have been the <br/>
many parents who have benefited from this book since it&#39;s birth in <br/>
2000. I hope that with your help, &quot;Peaceful Parents, Peaceful Kids&quot; <br/>
will make it to its tenth birthday and beyond. <br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Peaceful Parents, Peaceful Kids&quot; is available at Amazon.com for only <br/>
$11.20. Here is the exact link. <br/>

Below is an adapted excerpt from &quot;Peaceful Parents, Peaceful Kids&quot; on <br/>
tantrums that I know many of you will find helpful. As my way of <br/>
saying thanks to anyone who buys the book, I want to send you a signed <br/>
book plate for the inside cover. E-mail me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Naomi@...">Naomi@...</a> <br/>
for details. <br/>
 <br/>
Thank you, as always for your support.  You generously responded when <br/>
I asked for people to participate in my national survey of <br/>
elementary-aged kids on conflict, anger, and bullying.  As a result <br/>
over 2100 students and hundreds of teachers took part.  As soon as I <br/>
get the go-ahead from Free Spirit Publishing, I will share with you <br/>
the complete results.  However, as loyal readers, I&#39;d like you to know <br/>
the one result that most stood out for me: <br/>
 <br/>
73% percent of the students surveyed think other kids are somewhat to <br/>
very mean to each other. <br/>
 <br/>
This is why the work of peacemaking has to continue in our homes, <br/>
school, communities, and in the world at large.  I am so grateful you <br/>
are all a part of it. <br/>
 <br/>
In peace, Naomi <br/>
 <br/>

FROM &quot;PEACEFUL PARENTS, PEACEFUL KIDS:&quot; <br/>
DEALING WITH TANTRUMS <br/>
 <br/>
What parent doesn&#39;t dread tantrums?  Well, here&#39;s some good news <br/>
--you can alleviate much of the chaos brought on by tantrums by <br/>
identifying what kind tantrum you child is having: manipulative or <br/>
spill-over. <br/>
 <br/>
A manipulative tantrum is the kind kids use to get their way. These <br/>
tantrums often take place when your child wants something and you say <br/>
no. Your child then throws a fit to force you to change your mind.  A <br/>
spill-over tantrum is an entirely different thing.  Spill-over <br/>
tantrums happen when a child becomes overwhelmed by feelings, senses, <br/>
and stimuli. These tantrums are unintentional. They usually happen <br/>
when kids are over-tired or hungry.  Children who are highly <br/>
emotional, ultra-sensitive, and easily over-stimulated tend to have <br/>
spill-over tantrums. <br/>
 <br/>
Both types of tantrums need to be handled differently. <br/>
 <br/>
The first step is to determine which type of tantrum your child is <br/>
having. If she&#39;s yelling and screaming because you won&#39;t let her have <br/>
ice cream, it&#39;s probably a manipulative tantrum. Best to ignore it. <br/>
Walk into another room and let her emote without the benefit of an <br/>
audience. If you&#39;re out, take your child to the car and let her scream <br/>
there. Most importantly, don&#39;t give in or you&#39;ll just encourage <br/>
another tantrum next time she wants her way. After the tantrum&#39;s over, <br/>
explain, in no uncertain terms, that her behavior was unacceptable, <br/>
then give a consequence like taking away a special toy for at least a <br/>
day, or removing a privilege. <br/>
 <br/>
Tell your child that you expect better of her and that you were <br/>
disappointed in her behavior.  Use a no-nonsense non-yelling voice and <br/>
make direct eye contact. Remember, you&#39;re the model for your child&#39;s <br/>
behavior. One more caveat. If you say you&#39;re going to take away a toy <br/>
if your child throws another tantrum, be sure to do it. Backing off <br/>
will only reinforce manipulation. <br/>
 <br/>
Spill-over tantrums are entirely different. Your child may be caught <br/>
in the pattern of feeling overwhelmed and losing control without <br/>
wanting to. Let&#39;s say it&#39;s been a stressful week and he&#39;s has had a <br/>
long and over-stimulating day. It&#39;s past his bedtime, and as he walks <br/>
toward his bed he accidentally knocks over a Lego airplane he just <br/>
made. He starts wailing uncontrollably and before long, he&#39;s <br/>
completely out of control. This is a spill-over tantrum. Here are a <br/>
few suggestions for handling it: <br/>
 <br/>
- Try to rectify the source of the problem if at all possible. In <br/>
this case, helping him put together his broken airplane might do the <br/>
trick <br/>
. <br/>
- Stay close by. Let your presence be a calming influence. Sometimes <br/>
leaving the room will add to your child&#39;s upset, so take some deep <br/>
breaths and try to keep your own composure. <br/>
 <br/>
- Touch your child gently if he allows it. Try hugging or stroking <br/>
him. Let him put his head in your lap or lean against you; whisper <br/>
soothing words to him like, &quot;Mommy&#39;s right here. You&#39;re going to be <br/>
OK.&quot; Try to remain calm even if he keeps wailing. <br/>
 <br/>
- Ask him to stop after about five minutes. Have him take a series of <br/>
slow, deep breaths to regain his composure. Breathe together if you <br/>
can. Offering a distraction might help too. &quot;Let&#39;s go downstairs and <br/>
get a nice cool drink.&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
- Don&#39;t allow your child to do anything destructive during his <br/>
tantrum, no matter how upset he is. Make sure he knows ahead of time <br/>
what&#39;s acceptable and what isn&#39;t. Hurting himself, others, or property <br/>
are not okay. <br/>
 <br/>
Talk afterwards and help your child identify the feelings that <br/>
brought on his tantrum. Together come up with a  plan for next time. <br/>
Ask him to let you know when he&#39;s feeling overtired or in need of a <br/>
break. Be aware of situations that could trigger him. <br/>
 <br/>
If you do all this and the spill-over tantrums continue, try keeping <br/>
a journal and noting what tends to set your child off. Most of all, <br/>
don&#39;t lose hope.  This is probably a stage that will end as quickly as <br/>
it came on.  We&#39;ve all been there. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-705059319">Parenting a Fee Child, An Unschooled Life by Rue Kream (there&#39;s even a picture of her cute little butt on the cover!)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Available from <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.freechild.info/">http://www.freechild.info/</a>  for only $14 plus shipping. Worth its weight in gold! A real BARGAIN! A *must-have* for every unschooling home!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A few reviews:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
With a loving heart, generous openness, and the absolute conviction born of experience and observation, Rue is offering both practical suggestions and a paradigm stretching point of view to anyone seeking a greater understanding of a daily life of Unschooling with joy. I personally can’t think of a single question that is not covered somewhere. The format is easy to read, full of warm anecdotes, challenging ideas, and the core idea that the heart of Unschooling is parenting with absolute Trust. ~Robyn L. Coburn, unschooling mom of Jayn<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
“It&#39;s simple, but not easy.”   Without even leaving home, your life can change all kinds of ways.  Relationships between parents and children can go from rough and antagonistic to peaceful, productive and sweet.   It&#39;s not easy, changing one&#39;s life for the better, but this book shows that it&#39;s simple.  ~Sandra Dodd, unschooling mom of Kirby, Marty and Holly<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I can imagine that some might think that such a life with children is just too good to be true. But I know from my own experience that it is possible! Take her advice to heart!  ~Kelly Lovejoy, unschooling mom of Cameron and Duncan<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The most useful book published for new unschoolers since The Unschooling Handbook.  Rue addresses clearly and persuasively the most common questions and objections in an easily accessible format. The personal experience and conviction brought to each answer shines through along with her deep love and respect for her children. I&#39;d recommend this book to anyone embarking on an unschooling lifestyle or wondering how to counter objections from family or friends.  ~Danielle Conger, unschooling mom of Emily, Julia, and Sam<br/>

I&#39;m incredibly new to RU, but I felt the same way, Karen.  The idea of <br/>
putting them in another room and ignoring them just seems so <br/>
disconnected and unaccepting of their feelings!<br/>
<br/>
What is the book by Rue you are referring to?  We seriously just <br/>
started learning about RU about a month ago, so I&#39;m trying to get my <br/>
hands on everything I can!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-380284660"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In the example she chooses to highlight, she refers to a child as<br/>
&gt; &quot;manipulative&quot; and she advises taking away a prized toy as punishment (but<br/>
&gt; she uses the the common euphemism, &quot;consequence&quot;). I don&#39;t like the idea<br/>
&gt; that my child is trying to be &quot;manipulative&quot; when he has so few tools to<br/>
&gt; deal with his environment as it is. You&#39;d think an adult parent would have<br/>
&gt; more tools than simply ignoring the child and taking away a special<br/>
&gt; toy---talk about MANIPULATIVE!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I had to respond to this.  I can&#39;t tell you how often I get the manipulative<br/>
crap thrown at me.  My 2 yr old &quot;manipulates&quot; me into nursing, my 5 yr old<br/>
was &quot;manipulating&quot; me when she had been at my mom&#39;s for a while, I came over<br/>
and she wanted to snuggle with me rather than go put the puzzle together<br/>
with my niece and I was &quot;undermining&quot; my mother by going with her to put the<br/>
puzzle together as a compromise.   It&#39;s gotten to the point that if anyone<br/>
uses manipulate in the context of my children, I bark at them immediately.<br/>
I should probably come up with a better response ;-)<br/>
<br/>
But if we really think about it, it is a child&#39;s job to &quot;manipulate&quot; their<br/>
parents.  I just choose to find a way of expressing it that is less negative<br/>
in its connotation.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A &quot;tantrum&quot; is a form of communication. If the parent has been so oblivious<br/>
&gt; to the child&#39;s attempt to communicate that the child must resort to<br/>
&gt; &quot;tantrumming&quot;, whose fault is THAT?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I&#39;m not totally sure about this.  Ime, toddlers can tantrum despite a<br/>
parent&#39;s attempts to anticipate them.  In that sense, I really liked the<br/>
distinction between the &quot;types&quot; of tantrums.  And I have to say, for<br/>
whatever reason, my kids have never responded to affection during tantrums.<br/>
If I&#39;m being totally honest, letting them cool down in another room ended up<br/>
being better for all.  It was awful to see him so upset and I desperately<br/>
wanted him to stop hurting (and yes, it is/was very stressful for me as<br/>
well).  Not to be dramatic, but he didn&#39;t have to suffer as long that way.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been able to observe better with my third child, and am amazed that he<br/>
seems totally aware (on some level) that he is being &quot;irrational&quot; when he is<br/>
having tantrums.  We will ask him &quot;are you a toddler&quot; Ryan? or &quot;how old are<br/>
you, 2&quot;?  and it could be me, but it seems to help him understand that the<br/>
tantrums are tough but are normal, if that makes sense.  These things are<br/>
said very gently by the way, as I know you can&#39;t read that via email and<br/>
those same words could be said very cruelly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Rue&#39;s book paints a much better picture of how I would want my relationship<br/>
&gt; with my children to look. I would pay BIG bucks to keep Rue Kream&#39;s book in<br/>
&gt; print.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I really want to read this.  I might do that instead of trying to read off<br/>
from websites.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!!!  I&#39;m getting a lot from these discussions.<br/>
