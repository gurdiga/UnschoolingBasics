<div id="ygrps-yiv-1239400906">I would love some advice this.<br/>
<br/>
What do you do when you and your child have different spiritual beliefs? How<br/>
do you handle it when your child asks you to take him to functions that<br/>
conflict with your beliefs? When we discuss spirituality or religion I<br/>
almost feel like I&#39;m doing something wrong. Like I&#39;m trying to convert him<br/>
or something, which I really don&#39;t feel the need to do. And I hesitate to<br/>
invite him to functions that I would like to go to that are about my beliefs<br/>
after the absolutely horrified look I got the first time I asked. When we<br/>
talk I always tell him that his beliefs are his own and mine are mine and we<br/>
don&#39;t have to agree in order to share but I am surprised at how much our<br/>
beliefs influence the language we use, the things we watch, the music we<br/>
listen to, just our general outlook on life. Is this something I should just<br/>
not bring up at all? He is happy in his beliefs and feels comfortable in<br/>
them. Once before I have mentioned another point of view in a discussion and<br/>
he got very upset and frustrated and started to cry. <br/>
<br/>
We have always shared everything and enjoyed talking about everything in our<br/>
hearts and on our minds. Should this be any different? Or should I just<br/>
leave it alone and share only when he asks for now?<br/>
<br/>
(He is 9 by the way)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1337206995">Here&#39;s our we handle it...<br/>
<br/>
My husband & I are born into the Roman Catholic religion BUT my <br/>
husband is not fond of organized religion and I&#39;ve considered myself <br/>
agnostic for most of my adult life. <br/>
<br/>
When we adopted our kids, we wanted them to start out the same <br/>
religion that we technically were so we had them baptized and they <br/>
all just did their first Communion. Now that they&#39;re &quot;Catholic&quot;, <br/>
they&#39;re free to continue pursing it or not. We freely discuss the <br/>
many world religions and we have several books, on a variety of <br/>
religions, available to them to read. <br/>
<br/>
They know my feelings as an agnostic and they know my husbands <br/>
feelings as someone uncomfortable with organized religion. They also <br/>
know my mothers feelings on being Roman Catholic and why church is <br/>
important to her. <br/>
<br/>
My son shows no interest in religion, my oldest daughter believes in <br/>
God and my youngest...well, I think she may be my grandmother <br/>
reincarnated (LOL)....she prays on her rosary beads every night <br/>
(sometimes up to 30 minutes) and attends CCD classes at the local <br/>
catholic church. <br/>
<br/>
We treat religion as we do every other topic....we discuss it, we <br/>
share our opinion...we respect other opinions (as long as that <br/>
opinion doesn&#39;t include harming another).<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756655184">Well, here in the Allen household, we have a liberal Christian (my dh,<br/>
not liberal politically, but very much a religious liberal) and then<br/>
the rest of us that have no label. <br/>
<br/>
My philisophical leanings are towards Zen Buddhism, but I don&#39;t think<br/>
I&#39;ll ever call myself a Zen Buddhist because that means you actually<br/>
practice at it, and Zen for me is a very personal journey that needs<br/>
no label.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo...my kids ask questions, we explore all religions because it&#39;s<br/>
interesting! I love learning about all sorts of religions and have<br/>
done a ton of research on the origins of Christianity and how the<br/>
early church was influenced and politicized. I learned a bunch about<br/>
the basics of Islam and Eastern thought, I&#39;ve delved very shallowly<br/>
into Judaism. It&#39;s all fascinating to me. <br/>
<br/>
Sierra wanted to attend VBS a couple years in a row, back in<br/>
Pensacola. I  signed her up and she loved her week there.  I cringed<br/>
everytime I took her to that Baptist church (almost caught on fire<br/>
once I believe) because I just knew someone was going to try and<br/>
convert me, but it didn&#39;t happen.<br/>
With so many children running in every direction, they had no time for<br/>
an outside heathen.;)<br/>
<br/>
She asked me about a couple Jesus related things afterwards, but<br/>
really wasn&#39;t that curious overall. She was there for the crafts, the<br/>
singing and the other kids.  She doesn&#39;t want to go anymore, but I&#39;d<br/>
take her again if she did.<br/>
<br/>
I believe spirituality comes from within. I trust my children will<br/>
explore the world with that sacred place within them intact, unharmed<br/>
by any molding or shaping from outside sources, learning what fits for<br/>
them, just like anything else in life.<br/>
