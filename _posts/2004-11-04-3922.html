<div id="ygrps-yiv-862044995">Hey everyone please contact the sponsor of this drive and make an appt. to<br/>
go donate blood. It&#39;s for a really good cause...a little girl&#39;s life, and to<br/>
help her family who has been hit extremely hard financially due to medical<br/>
bills. If you can&#39;t donate blood, maybe you can make a small monetary<br/>
donation. Thank you so much for any help you can give!<br/>

Hi everyone!<br/>
This is not a chain email - I created it and it is very real - please read<br/>
to the end...AND see attached flyer!<br/>
<br/>
Would you like to do something meaningful for someone else this holiday<br/>
season? This is something that a life depends on, and it won&#39;t cost you a<br/>
dime!<br/>
<br/>
Star will be 4 years old on 11/13. She has Wilms Tumor, Stage 4, Unfavorable<br/>
Histology. She is on ICE treatments for cancer in her lungs and other parts<br/>
of her body.<br/>
<br/>
Star is in the hospital several times a month and is very sick right now.<br/>
She must have transfusions frequently due to low blood counts. Did you know<br/>
that a single transfusion can run from $250 to $500!!!<br/>
<br/>
I have put together a blood drive on November 19th from 9 am to 7 pm. All of<br/>
the blood will count towards Star&#39;s treatments which will take a huge<br/>
financial burden off of her family.<br/>
<br/>
We need to collect at least 150 units of blood. This will be hard to do, but<br/>
it is the goal that I have set for this child. PLEASE call me to set your<br/>
appointment. It will be held at 300 E. Huntland Drive (78752) in central<br/>
Austin near Highland Mall off of I-35 & 2222/290.<br/>
<br/>
It only takes 15 minutes to donate blood and approximately 1 hour for<br/>
platelets!  Please bring a picture ID & your Social Security #. Walk-ins<br/>
welcome.<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested in posting a flyer or poster at your place of<br/>
employment, please contact me asap. Please feel free to pass this info<br/>
along! We need all the donors we can get.<br/>
<br/>
If you are unable to give blood but would like to make a monetary donation<br/>
to Star for hospital bills you can drop it off on the day of the drive, or<br/>
you can mail it to me at:<br/>
<br/>
Cindy Klatt<br/>
4503 River Wood Court<br/>
Austin, TX 78731<br/>
