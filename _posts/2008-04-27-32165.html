~~(Some people love Home School Legal Defense and some people hate it<br/>
but they do list each state&#39;s laws and requirements)~~<br/>
<br/>
Not always as accurately as they should though. HSLDA likes to have<br/>
statistics to back up homeschooling, because they are a political<br/>
group NOT an activist group.<br/>
<br/>
So they don&#39;t always list the BEST options for unschoolers, which<br/>
include umbrella schools. Or they simply mention it without any<br/>
details. You&#39;re better off reading the law at a TX site and getting in<br/>
touch with local unschoolers for further clarification.<br/>
<br/>
TX is one of the easiest states for homeschooling. There is no reason<br/>
to make your child wait....you have the right to withdraw him now. <br/>
