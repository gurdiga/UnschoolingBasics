Sounds like you have stopped punishing but haven&#39;t given them any tools to  <br/>
use to replace the hitting when confronted with a problem.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-319318675">Pam,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for the suggestions for how not to punish for <br/>
aggression among siblings.  I think what you are saying makes alot of <br/>
sense.  I will definitely start saying &quot;what is the problem&quot;.  But <br/>
(isn&#39;t there always a but...) I was wondering whether I could <br/>
say &quot;let&#39;s try to solve problems by discussing rather than hitting&quot; <br/>
or &quot;can you think of another way to get what you want without <br/>
hitting&quot;.  In other words, my underlying message is that hitting is <br/>
wrong when you are angry for not getting what you want.  I agree that <br/>
hitting is okay for self-defense or rescuing someone.  <br/>
<br/>
Do your boys ever want you to punish the other when they&#39;ve been <br/>
hurt?  Mine always demand that I do (because I have in the <br/>
past).  &quot;You aren&#39;t even going to do anything to Mark...he hurt me <br/>
and you never punish him!&quot;.  I don&#39;t know how to respond to that.  I <br/>
don&#39;t want to outright tell them that I won&#39;t be punishing them <br/>
anymore.  I am seeing though that when I don&#39;t punish, it is helping <br/>
me stay out of it moreso and them realizing they are accountable for <br/>
their conflicts.   By staying out of it, I mean taking a listening <br/>
role and hopefully being there so it doesn&#39;t escalate.  The big <br/>
problems occur when I&#39;m not nearby and I am worried that someday one <br/>
of them will get seriously hurt, most likely the younger one who is <br/>
almost 20 pounds lighter.  My older son has sensory integration <br/>
issues (some Asperger characteristics) and really does struggle with <br/>
regulation.  He is generally happy, but can become explosive.  I <br/>
read &quot;The Explosive Child&quot; a few years back, and am wondering if <br/>
that&#39;s the one where they want you to make them do exercises as an <br/>
extreme if they don&#39;t comply.  That&#39;s what I&#39;m thinking, but that <br/>
doesn&#39;t sound in line with this group.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My older dd (Darcy) does sometimes ask me to punish younger dd (Brenna)<br/>
even though I never really have been a punisher.  I usually say that I <br/>
will talk to Brenna about it and see how she feels about what <br/>
happened, but I need to do it alone.  Darcy really really wants things <br/>
to be &quot;fair&quot; and if she feels wronged, she wants some action!  We do <br/>
not have much success with discussing things all together because she <br/>
cannot help but interrupt or tell Brenna that she&#39;s wrong or how to <br/>
feel or something along those lines.<br/>
<br/>
Brenna, OTOH, usually stomps off to her room on her own to cool off.  <br/>
She can certainly be the teaser at times, but she is more easily <br/>
distracted and is not concerned with fairness.  (She told me that she <br/>
smiles at herself in the mirror when she&#39;s upset, and that always <br/>
helps her feel better.  She told me to try it when I&#39;m upset - so cute)<br/>

Do your boys ever want you to punish the other when they&#39;ve been<br/>
hurt?  Mine always demand that I do (because I have in the<br/>
past).  &quot;You aren&#39;t even going to do anything to Mark...he hurt me<br/>
and you never punish him!&quot;.  I don&#39;t know how to respond to that.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t usually respond to sibling questions because I have two <br/>
&quot;onlies&quot;---eight years apart. It&#39;s not an issue here.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No one gets to be hurt---no punishments for ANYONE! Don&#39;t expect the <br/>
sibling to get one. It won&#39;t happen. Quit expecting it. When we know <br/>
better, we DO better. I know that punishment doesn&#39;t work, AND I know <br/>
that hurting someone doesn&#39;t make things right. I won&#39;t hurt either of <br/>
you, and I won&#39;t allow either of you to get hurt. It&#39;s my job to <br/>
protect EACH of you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Since no one has suggested Sandra&#39;s solution, I&#39;ll post that:<br/>
<br/>
Three steps:<br/>
<br/>
1) talk it out<br/>
2) if that doesn&#39;t work, fnd an adult to help solve the problem<br/>
3) if that doesn&#39;t work, *then* they can hit.<br/>
<br/>
They still have the option to hit---and just knowing they can could be <br/>
enough; BUT they have to exhaust the first two steps FIRST. ANd we know <br/>
that if they find the adult to help arbitrate, they will never get to <br/>
step 3.<br/>
