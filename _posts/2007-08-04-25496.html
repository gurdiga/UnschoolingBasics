<div id="ygrps-yiv-405392634">Here is a note I just sent to the AlwaysUnschooled list. It was more<br/>
intended for this list originally, but seems to fit there too; I&#39;m also<br/>
posting it here to say thanks for the help on perspective here in recent<br/>
discussions and also for the link to that list more focused on unschooling<br/>
younger kids.<br/>
<br/>
==<br/>
<br/>
The other day, and not for the first time, our almost four year old kept<br/>
saying they wanted to break the windows in our home, and even proceeded to<br/>
hit them a few times with some objects. Explaining why I did not want the<br/>
windows broken did not help much, including explaining how more money and<br/>
time for repairing windows would mean less money and time for toys and<br/>
playing. Similarly, explaining how dangerous broken glass can be also didn&#39;t<br/>
make much of an difference.<br/>
<br/>
Thinking on this list and recent comments on perspective, I came up with<br/>
another approach. I took an empty Kimchi jar with thick glass out of the<br/>
recycling bin and placed it in a shallow box, which I carried outside our<br/>
home, and with both of us wearing safety glasses and my kid wearing gloves,<br/>
I provided my kid a real hammer to whack the jar (I also covered the box<br/>
with a transparent plastic bag to help hold back any small flying glass).<br/>
They wanted to just smash it on the ground, but I insisted on the box,<br/>
explaining how I did not want to walk on broken glass embedded in the ground<br/>
later. They could not break the jar on one or two weak attempts, so after<br/>
being asked to, I used the hammer it and shattered it. Then our kid pounded<br/>
it some more to break up what remained somewhat, and then they wanted to do<br/>
it again on another jar.<br/>
<br/>
I pointed out how many small and sharp glass pieces such a small jar or two<br/>
had made and how many big and dangerous pieces breaking a big window would<br/>
produce, and our kid agreed. I also let them touch one that wasn&#39;t very<br/>
sharp and showed how the others were sharper. Then, explaining I did not<br/>
want the garbage people to get cut by broken glass, I sealed up the box with<br/>
tape and asked our kid write broken glass on it (a scribble) and I also<br/>
wrote that in English. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just though I&#39;d share that experience; I think there is some truth<br/>
in that I might not have thought of that approach except from trying to<br/>
shift my perspective -- even as I still think &quot;freedom&quot; remains a slippery<br/>
concept to pin down, as it sometimes means different things to different<br/>
people. :-)<br/>

I think that was a REALLY cool example of meeting the underlying need<br/>
and trusting their learning!! I really enjoyed reading about their<br/>
glass breaking exploration and rather than a &quot;no&quot;, you found a safe<br/>
way to honor everyone&#39;s need at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
I think your example completely sums up the difference between mindful<br/>
parenting and more mainstream approaches. It&#39;s not about ignoring your<br/>
own needs either (wanting safety and windows is pretty<br/>
understandable!) yet trusting that this is a thing they truly need to<br/>
explore for their own reasons. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing that. It was really uplifting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-579838232">Wow! I love this! I agree with Ren, what an uplifting post - <br/>
thanks :) <br/>
<br/>
As an aside, from the perspective of traditional Chinese medicine <br/>
(TCM), breaking glass is a really beneficial activity. Everything <br/>
about it - the action of throwing or smashing, the sound of the glass <br/>
breaking, allowing the &quot;chaos&quot; to flow, and taking responsibility for <br/>
the actions by cleaning up the broken glass so that no one is harmed <br/>
by it - these are all extremely beneficial for the liver meridian, <br/>
which is the organ that governs/relates to anger. (Breaking green <br/>
glass is particularly recommended, as green is the color related to <br/>
liver.) My TCM doctor and Qi gong teacher regularly &quot;prescribes&quot; <br/>
breaking glass to his students and patients. (Throwing eggs is also <br/>
good for the liver.) So good for you for helping facilitate your <br/>
child&#39;s need! Kids are so beautifully self-regulating! Really, we <br/>
should all aspire to be so clear :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for sharing this inspiring piece of your life.<br/>
<br/>

How funny.  There have been times in my life that I&#39;ve intentionally smashed<br/>
glass.   It was a very satisfying primal expression of my own frustrations<br/>
and after doing so I felt much release of my own tension.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1462554272">This was great Paul. Great for other new parents to see that there is more than saying no   or letting them do everything they want.<br/>
It takes MORE parenting and thnking outside the box to be an unschooler. It is not about saying or not saying no.<br/>
