A good way to &quot;start&quot; though, is to live like you are on vacation - not a dull vacation where you&#39;re grateful for school to start up again, but the best kind of vacation, where you go places and do things out of curiositiy or enthusiasm - or snuggle up together enjoying one anothers&#39; company. <br/>
