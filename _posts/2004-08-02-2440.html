<div id="ygrps-yiv-2070854411">Another newbie piping in.  It sounds to me like you are doing a great job.  <br/>
Although you must be frustrated, it reads as if you are doing all the &quot;right&quot; <br/>
things to help your son work through his frustrations and issues.  <br/>
 <br/>
Two things.  The first is that we use Rescue Remedy here as well and I don&#39;t <br/>
feel like it&#39;s a magical solution to stop tantrums in their tracks.  I feel <br/>
like helping your body or your child&#39;s body along using herbs can be a good <br/>
thing.  Sometimes I feel so tight and tense and stressed out I want to scream.  <br/>
Occasionally, herbs help to bring me out of that feeling.  They might help your <br/>
son as well and maybe you&#39;ll find them helpful on your path to finding the <br/>
source of the problem.  So, just suggesting that you don&#39;t rule it out.  We also <br/>
use a California Baby &quot;Overtired and Cranky&quot; spray which contains essential <br/>
oils and you just spritz around your child&#39;s head and back of neck - my son <br/>
loves it and sometimes just the funny feeling of the nice smelling spray is enough <br/>
to distract him from his tantrum.  He never gets more mad because of the <br/>
spray.<br/>
 <br/>
The second thing is that I read a Mothering magazine article about kids and <br/>
hmmm... sorry I&#39;m going to not be totally sure what I&#39;m talking about because I <br/>
can&#39;t find the mag, but I thought it was about tantrums.  Emotional release <br/>
was a big thing.  It talked about parents doing everything they can to stop the <br/>
crying right away but that it wasn&#39;t good for the kids because they needed to <br/>
scream and cry to release whatever that &quot;stuff&quot; is once in awhile and just <br/>
get it out.  That certainly doesn&#39;t answer your post about ways to get to the <br/>
source of his tantrums, but at least it sounds to me from reading that article <br/>
that you are doing a great job being there for him during the tantrum and not <br/>
trying to stop it or suppress his feelings.  Hang in there.<br/>
 <br/>

There was an article titled Help for Tantrums in the Nov/Dec 2002 issue of Mothering Mag.  More recently, in the Jan/Feb 2004 issue there was one titled Hold Your Crying Baby, written more about high-crying infants.  <br/>
 <br/>
You can probably find the articles online at www.mothering.com  the article may be in their archives.  <br/>

I recall it being a good article.  I think I&#39;ll read it again -- Dan&#39;s thrown a few tantrums just in the last couple of weeks.  I fear he may be building towards that stormy 4yo I&#39;ve heard about!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-384619303">&lt;&lt;&lt;I recall it being a good article.  I think I&#39;ll read it again -- Dan&#39;s<br/>

<br/>
One of the ideas that has worked for me, I think it is part of the NVC<br/>
toolbox, is to stop using the word &quot;tantrum&quot;, since it contains implied<br/>
judgments and is too easy to dismiss. Instead describe what is actually<br/>
happening. EG: Jayn is crying and stamping her feet, or rolling on the floor<br/>
screaming. It helps me not see the actions as endless, or give it more power<br/>
in my mind. Conversely it helps me not say &quot;it&#39;s *just* a tantrum&quot; and I<br/>
then don&#39;t just ride it out without helping Jayn find what she needs.<br/>
<br/>
The next step is to express the best guess at what Jayn is feeling - angry,<br/>
frustrated, lonely, hungry, tired, distressed, afraid - whatever. <br/>
