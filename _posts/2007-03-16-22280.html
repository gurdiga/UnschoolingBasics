<div id="ygrps-yiv-475498673">Hi Jennifer- <br/>
      With regard to balancing work/career with homeschooling,  this is a deeply personal choice. <br/>
I am a physician and it would have been  difficult for me to set my newly blossoming career aside to be home full-time as a mother- and actually I want to work.... a little.   The solution that made the most sense for our family was for me to have my medical offices attached to my home and to work part-time (usually two days per week).  When my children were babies I had the advantage of being able to work even fewers  hours for awhile and I could l pop upstairs to my  residence to breast feed or comfort a sick child as needed.  I have also been blessed to find a wonderful, nurturing young lady who comes to our home to be with the children while I work. Having her is the next best thing to being there myself (or dh of course).    I like that my children me as a person who has dreams and needs of her own, and responsibilties outside home and family.   Because I am just downstairs and they can come and &#39;see me&#39; if they need to, they feel secure that I am always available to them, so <br/>
very rarely DO they ever come looking for me while I am with patients. At times I am exhausted (even just working 2 days) because my job involves so much nurturing of other people that sometimes by the end of my work day I have little &#39;nuturing &#39; left in me for my family ...but my children are respectful of  my exhaustion .  I usually get all sorts of excited shrieks of &#39;HI MOMMY!!!!&#39; when I first come in the door followed by hugs and kisses, and then they go back to whatever they were working on (or watching) .  Sometimes I feel guilty-ish that I cannot be 100% my usual self after a long work day - but overall this arrangement works for our family.  I like that they know that my dream was to become a doctor and how I worked to achieve that goal, and that it makes me happy to do my work.   <br/>
     Obviously not everyone has a job that could be done from home or that could be done part-time. <br/>
I knew going into my chosen career that I wanted to be a mommy (though I didn&#39;t know I would homeschool yet) and I specifically chose a specialty that would allow me flexible hours with few emergencies.  Had I chosen a different career with less flexibility I would have looked into other options-  not working at all for awhile, job-sharing, changing to a job that I could do from home or at least part-time, or working a shift opposite dh so one parent would always be be with the children.  None of these options is quite like mommy being home all the time but are some possible compromises for a mom who either wants to needs to work.  If you have a job that can be done from home, even hiring someone to come to your home (while you are there working in another room) is a great option- this could even be perhaps an older homeschooling child .  Anyhow just some thoughts and ideas ...I hope this helps. <br/>
     With regard to other people questioning your decision to homeschool- wow- that is definitely something most homeschoolers I know struggle with at some point. Not everyone feels the need to explain their choices....some do... My parents were both school teachers (public school) and I know they were somewhat taken aback intially when I announced our decision.  They know see what a wonderful thing homeschooling can be . Anyhow, I did not feel the need to explain too much- though answering the questions of my parents usually involved more elaboration (because I knew they were honestly interested ) than those given to a casual acquaintance.  <br/>
     Ironically (getting back to working) working from home has given me LOTS of opportunities to discuss homeschooling with people I barely know.  My offices are in the basement of our home and often my patients hear my children running happily through the house just over their heads.  The natural questions come up about  how many children I have, how old my children are, etc.,   As my children entered the ages where people assumed they would be in school,  I would get questions from my patients about why the kids were home....this has led to many a conversation about homeschooling.  I have to say that SO many people are supportive of our homeschooling status and many reply &#39;i wish that had been an option when my kids were young&#39; and &#39; i think you are doing a wonderful thing&#39;. etc.,  It never hurts to have that extra support !  I expected to have to come up with some sort of  &#39;pat answer&#39; regarding our decision to homeschool just to satisfy the superficial curiosity of casual aqua<br/>
intances who may or may not agree with our choices .   Instead, I have loads of supporters who enjoy hearing about the kids and how much we love homeschooling.  I have met many other homeschooling families through work, and have been able to offer encouragment to moms and dads who are considering homeschooling for their own families.  So this is very satisfying for me .<br/>
     Good luck Jennifer!  Paula  (Christopher 9, Jonathan 7) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-21717660">Hi Paula,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much for your thoughtful response.  This helped me <br/>
better pinpoint what the issue was that bothered me so much.  I <br/>
realized (remembered!) that I will definitely be doing some sort of <br/>
work while I homeschool my son, and I have goals that I&#39;ll be <br/>
working towards at the same time that I&#39;m with my son.  As you said, <br/>
it&#39;s a personal choice and I can see how there&#39;s a huge variety of <br/>
situations with regards to homeschooling and working.  I&#39;ve always <br/>
believed that the best parent is a happy one.  So working or not, <br/>
full-time or part-time, whatever makes someone happy is good.<br/>
<br/>
I think I was just a little hurt by my father&#39;s suggestion that it&#39;s <br/>
better for a child to have his own life and he was concerned that by <br/>
homeschooling, he won&#39;t have enough separation from me to really <br/>
feel independent or self-sufficient (although my son is 3 right now, <br/>
so I&#39;m not sure how much of this he thinks he should have!)  And the <br/>
more I think about it, one of the main reasons I love the idea of <br/>
unschooling is because I believe it gives my son the freedom to <br/>
choose what to do with his life -- when he&#39;s 3 or 10 or 20.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I just have to accept that there will be criticisms and <br/>
concerns because I&#39;m choosing a path that&#39;s different from most of <br/>
the people around me.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for your response,<br/>
Jennifer</div>

I think your parents are fearful of the unknown. This is normal, and doesn&#39;t mean any lack of love or trust in you necessarily.  But<br/>
 whatever your parents think you are the one who must be at peace with your parenting. I am very close to my parents, and they just spent 6 weeks with us. Yet I know they don&#39;t understand what we are doing, and live in fear that it won&#39;t work out. Some of it is the safety of the familiar. They just want me to do what they understand....but I must live my own life. <br/>

Wonderful reply! I just figured I&#39;d post it again for those that didn&#39;t <br/>
pay close enough attention the first time!<br/>
<br/>
I also wanted to add that if kids are in school, they have NO WAY to <br/>
see what we&#39;re doing. They&#39;re too busy in school and doing homework and <br/>
being told what to do to pay attention to what we do. My boys get to <br/>
see me working and meeting clients. They get to go out into the world <br/>
rather than sit in a classroom half the year.<br/>
<br/>
Too often schooled kids have no idea how the world works because <br/>
they&#39;re stuck in a building simulating the working world. SO bizarre!<br/>

He&#39;ll see more of that while you&#39;re both out doing and sharing lots of <br/>

Well, we all unschool, so...we&#39;re a little biased. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Most of us have a LOT of interests. Some our children share with us. <br/>
Others are ours all alone. Some we got from our kids. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Well, most of your attention *should* be on him when he&#39;s really <br/>
little. As he ages, less and less time will be spent wih him as he <br/>
matures and eventually moves out. My older son is now 19. We hardly see <br/>
him anymore---with working and house/pet-sitting, the girlfriend---he&#39;s <br/>
so busy. I honestly don&#39;t regret one minute I&#39;ve spent with him (well, <br/>
except when I was being creepy!). I *do* regret the time he spent in <br/>
school away from me all day!<br/>
<br/>
Your parents had their chance to do their best with you, now it&#39;s your <br/>
time to do *your* best with *your* child! If you didn&#39;t ask for their <br/>
advice, it&#39;s impolte for them to give it.<br/>

There is a great magazine published in Canada, Life Learning magazine,<br/>
it will help you stay enthusiastic about not sending your son to<br/>
school. A good start for concerned family though might be The<br/>
Unschooling Handbook, its easy reading and may answer some of their<br/>
questions.I am an unschooling mom of five and took a year out from a<br/>
Bsc degree in Physics and Theoretical Physics to travel abroad and<br/>
then stayed out of study/work when my kids came along. I think a lot<br/>
of society are not even comfortable with stay at home mothers<br/>
nevermind home/unschooling! And you can have other interests right<br/>
along side your son, that is part of the freedom and fun!!!<br/>
