now and he made amazing progress in prek last year and<br/>
really started to blossom with his social and speech skills.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
At this list, you&#39;ll hear about how those types of intervention can be<br/>
harmful. If a child goes to speech therapy for long enough, it will<br/>
SEEM to work, because they hit a developmental stage and start talking<br/>
more. <br/>
There are very few people on earth, that really need any kind of<br/>
intervention that way.<br/>
<br/>
I have a child that didn&#39;t talk until three years of age. I heard<br/>
about &quot;don&#39;t you think he needs speech therapy?&quot; a few times.<br/>
He&#39;s 5 now, and talks just fine.<br/>
He&#39;d probably be labeled with several &quot;disabilities&quot; if I had him<br/>
tested. He will always just be Jalen. He will develop in his own time<br/>
and way.<br/>

Unschooling works for all children. Schooling will only be a stumbling<br/>

stimulating, rich environment for their children.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad you see unschooling as an option, I hope we can provide<br/>
enough resources for you to see that it will work wonderful for both<br/>

   I was reading the welcome message and one of the things that was posted was that anything you put in a post is pretty much up for discussion: I LOVE this! I think its great hearing different points of view. I have a good friend whose brother didnt speak til he was 4 and his mother never did speech therapy or anything like that. My point of view is that even if some people dont feel its necessary, some people do think well hey, it cant hurt right? Thats how I feel. I really dont believe speech therapy is harmful-its mostly play based and really fun at this young of an age. Anyway, it works for us. I am though, totally open to others opinions and thoughts on this!! :-)<br/>

&gt; was that anything you put in a post is pretty much up for discussion: I LOVE<br/>
&gt; this! I think its great hearing different points of view. I have a good<br/>
&gt; friend whose brother didnt speak til he was 4 and his mother never did<br/>

&gt; right?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Keon didn&#39;t start speaking much until he was closer to four.  My brother was<br/>
about that age as well before he was talking in sentences. I &quot;spoke&quot; for him<br/>
for the first 3 or 4 years of his life.  After I went to school he had to<br/>
learn some words but would speak in one word (and preferbly monosyllabic<br/>
ones at that) &quot;sentences.&quot;  Lots of &quot;point and grunt.&quot;  My brother still<br/>
isn&#39;t much of a talker.  He talks when necessary.  He&#39;s a man of few words.<br/>
When he does talk we listen.  With Keon he was frustrated at not being able<br/>
to communicate his wants and needs.  My brother not so.  My brother was so<br/>
laid back and adaptable that if he wanted apple juice but was given orange<br/>
juice he would just drink it.  Keon would spill it in a rage as I didn&#39;t<br/>
understand what it was he wanted.  While I think that having him speak at a<br/>
younger age would have been wonderful, all the speech therapy in the world<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have worked any faster.  He would have learned to speak when he was<br/>
developmentally ready.  We can&#39;t make those synapses connect faster by going<br/>
to therapy.  They are going to form at their speed.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t tell you the number of times that I have had friends whose<br/>
traditionally schooled children were in speech therapy and after *years* of<br/>
therapy &quot;suddenly&quot; it all paid off.  It didn&#39;t &quot;suddenly&quot; pay off.  The<br/>
child *finally* got to a point where they could comprehend what was going on<br/>
and most likely would have gotten there with or without therapy, but<br/>
probably with a whole let less stress, self-doubt and without feeling<br/>
labelled.<br/>
<br/>
I had an uncle that I remember that as a child (we are only a few years<br/>
apart) had a horrible speech impediment.  L&#39;s, R&#39;s, and F&#39;s were all<br/>
pronounced like W and S&#39;s were SH.  He also did something else weird.  Only<br/>
those of us that knew him well could understand him.  My grandfather refused<br/>
to put him in speech therapy (basically because my grandfather didn&#39;t want<br/>
him labeled &quot;stupid&quot; or &quot;special needs&quot;)  Suddenly in 6th grade his speech<br/>
cleared up.  Today you could never know that he had any problems speaking.<br/>
I miss my grandfather.  He was a self-educated man who quit school when he<br/>
was 14 to go to work on the railroads.  He would have been my biggest<br/>
supporter of unschooling.  I think he could really relate to the way that I<br/>
am raising my children.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1091738698">It may seem like everyone is harping on this subject, but to most <br/>
unschoolers it is so important that our kids have ownership of their <br/>
learning.  There are a lot of unschoolers who sent their children to <br/>
school before they knew about unschooling, and virtually all of them <br/>
wish they had never sent them to school.  Once children get the idea <br/>
that they need someone else to teach them in order to learn, it can <br/>
be really hard for them to trust their own ideas and abilities <br/>
again. <br/>
<br/>
The natural process of learning to speak or read is wonderful and <br/>
mysterious and very individual.  I think that it is contradictory to <br/>
say there is nothing wrong with your son EXCEPT that he&#39;s speech <br/>
delayed.  A delay implies that someone is not doing something when <br/>
he should, and we are saying that perhaps your son is learning <br/>
exactly when he should for his own unique development.  There are <br/>
many many children who hardly speak at all at the age of 3 or 4 and <br/>
yet they speak perfectly well a few years later.  <br/>
<br/>
Your son may enjoy going to school.  Lots of kids do.  But there are <br/>
other ways for him to be social without the restrictions of school.  <br/>
Even the most play-based schools and therapies still have <br/>
expectations, and even kids as young as 3 can sense these <br/>
expectations.<br/>

Its such a great place for him to go because he loves it so much! My kids are different. My son thrives on structure, which is sorta hard to give him all the time at home, while my daughter flies by the seat of her pants with everything-which is why I&#39;m going to homeschool her full time next year. I can&#39;t see how sending him to a preschool for 12 hours a week will harm him in any way shape or form. They are also sending him to summer camp which he LOVES. <br/>
  Please let me know if I should just go to another list? Its not as if I&#39;m getting upset about the discussion here-its just that maybe my views are too different from everyone elses? I really would like to stay here because of my daughter-I&#39;d love to hear what everyone else is up to and get advice for my own unschooling journey! If this is a list thats strictly for unschooling families all around, please let me know.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1715645301">Yes I did read the article and I couldn&#39;t help but feel that in my heart, thats how I feel about my son and maybe its just all the therapy and school thats already been crammed down our throats from the second I thought there was something delayed in my daughter that just nags at me to keep trying to get help-feeling the need for some kind of acknowledgement from someone else outside of his everyday life that yes, he&#39;s making great progress. I dont know what it is. I really didnt join this list boasting about how great school is-I happened to briefly mention that my son was in preschool and everyone kind of took it from there. I really appreciate everyone&#39;s input believe me, but I still have to say that it may take ME a while to adjust to an unschooling life style. I went thru a typical school and graduated, etc... and its not until I had put my daughter into preschool (which didnt work out either) that I started seriously looking at homeschooling as an option. Its that<br/>
 scared feeling of turning down therapy, possible further delays, that always kept me away from taking the plunge and living our lives the way I always thought was best. And with my son, well, he just kinda went in the same direction my daughter has gone except that he LOVES school. I&#39;ve always been 110% involved in every aspect of their schooling and I have no problem whatsoever pulling him if I feel he needs to be pulled. My daughter actually was going to get speech therapy this year and I&#39;m completely turning it down to keep her home. Of course, I&#39;m sure none of that makes any sense to anyone here but thats how I feel. <br/>
  Thank you for the article-it was really good. <br/>

    I never assume anything :-) thanks for your input. Actually, yes, sometimes my son shakes his head furiously screaming &quot;No cool momp!&quot; (No school mom) and I keep him home. But there are times when he gets dressed himself, starts packing his lunchbox and says &quot;cool momp&quot; all ready to go. So, he does have a choice and its a free preschool-why not? Its there as an option. I absolutely am aware that anything is up for discussion and thats a big reason why I joined. I like to hear other peoples opinions. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1513214111">&quot;but I still have to<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s very normal!<br/>
Kids are natural born learners...those of us with schooled minds find<br/>
it a lot harder to TRUST that process again. I wish I had a magic pill<br/>
I could give you, that would guarantee a great outcome for both your<br/>
children. I don&#39;t have one. But unschooling is the closest thing to a<br/>
magic pill that I&#39;ve found!!<br/>
<br/>
Life is unsure. No matter what we do, or what choices we make, there<br/>
are no guarantees of anything. I believe that unschooling is the best<br/>
way to give my children the gift of TRUST. The ability to trust<br/>
oneself is such an awesome tool in life. A tool that school often<br/>
strips from people.<br/>
<br/>
There is no &quot;behind&quot; or &quot;ahead&quot; with unschooling...your children are<br/>
simply being who-they-are at this very moment. Perfect and whole.  No<br/>
need to compare to other children or fret about development. Even if<br/>
they have issues that make certain things in life harder to navigate,<br/>
we can embrace ALL of that.<br/>
<br/>
I think the longer you travel this path, the more you read and learn<br/>
about natural learning, the easier it will be to trust that you don&#39;t<br/>
need that outside reassurance. Seeing your children&#39;s happy faces will<br/>
be enough to tell you that learning is happening each and every day<br/>
that they are alive!:)<br/>

I just wanted to second what Ren said, I&#39;m not going to judge YOU on  <br/>
what you do, everybody makes their own choices. But this is a  <br/>
discussion list, which means we discuss anything posted. Discussions  <br/>
aren&#39;t a reflection of YOU, per se, so I don&#39;t want you to take  <br/>
anything personally. It seems like once or twice a week, someone new  <br/>
gets their feelings hurt because the list says something negative  <br/>
about what was posted and they take it as a personal affront. People  <br/>
will point out things to you, because we only know what you write.  <br/>
It&#39;s very literal, we have no body language cues, we can&#39;t intuit  <br/>
what you mean, etc. That&#39;s why I was confused on the whole &quot;My son  <br/>
has autism/there&#39;s nothing wrong with my son&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
See, when you introduced as having children with autism, I assumed  <br/>
(poor assumption on my part, sorry) that if you were introducing them  <br/>
as autistic that it must be severe enough affect lifestyle, or else  <br/>
why would you introduce them as autistic to a bunch of strangers? A  <br/>
lot of people join and say their kid has this or that, as a way to  <br/>
excuse away why they *have* to do this school, or that therapy, or  <br/>
some kind of training. I just wanted it out on the table that there  <br/>
are already people here who radically unschool their children with  <br/>
severe disabilities, and it works.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter had a great program too...she loved school! Preschool for  <br/>
disabled kids is easy, laid-back and usually little more than  <br/>
babysitting (of course, there are exceptions...I&#39;ve heard gramercy  <br/>
school in NY is great). What happens when they get older is that they  <br/>
are either put into a program for severely disabled, and are  <br/>
basically babysat, or they are mainstreamed. I have seen it over and  <br/>
over again (I&#39;m a parent advocate for the autism society) that the  <br/>
kids have these ideals of how school should be, and then suddenly the  <br/>
rules change. Someone who needs structure has a hard time dealing  <br/>
with change!! If it works out differently than that, it&#39;s because the  <br/>
parents have advocated and fought for the modifications they need,  <br/>
and actually wind up doing most of the work ensuring that the schools  <br/>
and teachers follow the IEP, because they get sneaky when it gets  <br/>
hard (I&#39;m not bitter, honest ;-)  I&#39;m thankful things went wrong so  <br/>
soon after regular ed started for Bre, it was the kick in the pants  <br/>
we needed)<br/>
<br/>
I think basically what I said in my first email, was to watch him  <br/>
carefully for signs of discontent. If he&#39;s like my Josh, he seems  <br/>
happy because it&#39;s what he knows. He likes the structure....and he  <br/>
accepted that school is what it is...even when people were laughing  <br/>
at him (yes, in kindergarden). Yes, preschoolers are vicious,  <br/>
especially in large, barely managed groups. Both my middle girls went  <br/>
to regular preK, and I was blown away by how knowledgeable they are.  <br/>
Josh was out of school for 18 months before he said that he didn&#39;t  <br/>
know back then that the way he felt was ambivalent. He liked the  <br/>
school because it was predictable, he liked it because they told him  <br/>
constantly how &#39;good&#39; he was and how smart he was. He had no  <br/>
intrinsic value of self.<br/>
<br/>
So when I say anything, it&#39;s because I worry about any kid sent to  <br/>
school, but especially because I&#39;ve been where you are now....<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Please know that I am saying this gently and with compassion.  Delayed to<br/>
what?  Delayed to some arbitrary guideline that says what children &quot;should&quot;<br/>
be doing by a certain age?  Those guidelines work well for children who are<br/>
in school and for a school that needs to run smoothly.  The school system<br/>
hasn&#39;t figured out how to educate 30 children who may not all be on the same<br/>
level.  So they have classifications that tell parents where children should<br/>
be by a certain age in order to fit in with the rest of the class or<br/>
school.  Here&#39;s an even scary thing:  the charts that doctors and &quot;child<br/>
experts&quot; use for developmental advances are also based on how to best get a<br/>
child ready for school.  It&#39;s like grades and grade levels.  They are<br/>
totally irrelevant to an unschooling lifestyle.  They are a means for a<br/>
larger &quot;machine&quot; to operate smoothly.  They have nothing to do really with a<br/>
child&#39;s ability or understanding.<br/>
<br/>
You say he is making advances and I ask you, &quot;Advances to what?&quot;  As you<br/>
learn more about unschooling you will find that you need to deschool<br/>
yourself.  Stop thinking in terms of grades, grade levels, developmental<br/>
advancements.  Through mindful parenting, living joyfully and being where<br/>
your child needs to be you will see  your child grow and expand and become<br/>
the person that is best him.  By stopping the schooling earlier it will help<br/>
you get to joyful living sooner and seeing how unschooling can enrich your<br/>
lives more fully!  It can be a scary step when you have a child whose needs<br/>
are different from &quot;normal&quot; but later you will ask yourself why you ever<br/>
feared taking that step and why you didn&#39;t embrace this change sooner!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1594150648">Hi Jennifer,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m jumping in on this topic mainly because I grew up in Cranston RI<br/>
(22 yrs) and your name looks SO familiar!! *LOL* I called my sister <br/>
but she&#39;s away. &quot;Jennifer Long, Jennifer Long.. don&#39;t we know that <br/>
girl??&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You are much younger than I am (I&#39;m 35) but I wonder... My name was <br/>
Tonya Bass back then and my sister&#39;s name is Liza. Ring a bell??<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;d be too cool.<br/>
I live in Auburn MA now with my 3 children and we started <br/>
homeschooling a  year ago. Unschooling kinda fell into our lap as a <br/>
very sensicle way of going about things.<br/>
<br/>
Which brings me to my second child, Rory/7, who is convinced <br/>
he&#39;s &#39;not doing anything&#39;. Both my boys had vacations with my in <br/>
laws (one at a time) and my typically VERY non confrontational MIL <br/>
must have fed him some things because now he&#39;s saying &quot;I dont even <br/>
know math!&quot; &quot;I&#39;m 7 and don&#39;t know how to tie my shoes!&quot; &quot;I&#39;m 7 and I <br/>
don&#39;t know how to read&quot; Well, the shoe tying is true but I told <br/>
him, &quot;Uh, you can LEARN if you want to&quot; As far as the math and <br/>
reading, I gave him an example of &quot;I have 6 lollipops. How many do <br/>
you and your brother and sister get?&quot; and he knew and I told <br/>
him &quot;That&#39;s math!&quot; And then, when he&#39;s playing games on the <br/>
computer/game cube, he can read &quot;Game over&quot;, &quot;Loading&quot;, etc etc! <br/>
*LOL* So, what I&#39;m getting at is Rory only attended preschool for <br/>
two years (of which he had a BLAST!) and half day K for a year and <br/>
he&#39;s ALREADY thinking that you can&#39;t learn unless you are in school <br/>
or sitting with workbooks. I really didn&#39;t think he&#39;d have that <br/>
notion. But then, when my MIL ran up one side of my husband and down <br/>
another regarding her worry and concern about the kids&#39; education.. <br/>
maybe now I know why he&#39;s so fretful himself.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll admit, I&#39;m not totally a radical unschooler. I&#39;m slowly <br/>
morphing and letting to of my overly controlling ways and <br/>
understanding and growing and loving each day. Unschooling is truly <br/>
fabulous and a very fun journey and just a super way to Be with my <br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
I am also a firm believer in doing what works for you. I just <br/>
wanted, mainly, to say hi and see if you recognized my name too!<br/>

No one will judge *you* for sending your son to school. But if you  <br/>
post about the idea, people will point out -- not necessarily to you  <br/>
but to all those who are reading -- that there are better options for  <br/>
moving towards unschooling, if that make sense.<br/>

I think most people don&#39;t even realize that lists can be for  <br/>
something other than support so when their ideas get questioned on a  <br/>
discussion list it feels like rejection. But it isn&#39;t. It&#39;s just that  <br/>
discussion lists work differently than support lists. It&#39;s about  <br/>
discussing ideas that will help unschooling.<br/>

   No I dont know your name-that would&#39;ve been super cool if I did! :-( My maiden name is Palazzo-I&#39;ve been a Long for almost 8 years now though. I went to Cranston East-graduated in 97. Where in Cranston did you grow up? <br/>
  Finally, someone who doesnt think I&#39;m out of my mind for sending my son to prek! I&#39;m positive 100% that I will bring my son home too before he hits mandatory school age but I just want a year or so to really get my daughter going ya know? <br/>
  I havent yet told anyone about our homeschooling, well, except my mom, brother and best friend. Everyone else I can think of will think I&#39;m a loony tune. I wrote my letter of intent today and will be mailing it tommorow. <br/>
  So how far is Auburn? Maybe we could meet up since the kids are the same age!:-)<br/>

          Hi Jennifer,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m jumping in on this topic mainly because I grew up in Cranston RI<br/>
(22 yrs) and your name looks SO familiar!! *LOL* I called my sister <br/>
but she&#39;s away. &quot;Jennifer Long, Jennifer Long.. don&#39;t we know that <br/>
girl??&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You are much younger than I am (I&#39;m 35) but I wonder... My name was <br/>
Tonya Bass back then and my sister&#39;s name is Liza. Ring a bell??<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;d be too cool.<br/>
I live in Auburn MA now with my 3 children and we started <br/>
homeschooling a year ago. Unschooling kinda fell into our lap as a <br/>
very sensicle way of going about things.<br/>
<br/>
Which brings me to my second child, Rory/7, who is convinced <br/>
he&#39;s &#39;not doing anything&#39;. Both my boys had vacations with my in <br/>
laws (one at a time) and my typically VERY non confrontational MIL <br/>
must have fed him some things because now he&#39;s saying &quot;I dont even <br/>
know math!&quot; &quot;I&#39;m 7 and don&#39;t know how to tie my shoes!&quot; &quot;I&#39;m 7 and I <br/>
don&#39;t know how to read&quot; Well, the shoe tying is true but I told <br/>
him, &quot;Uh, you can LEARN if you want to&quot; As far as the math and <br/>
reading, I gave him an example of &quot;I have 6 lollipops. How many do <br/>
you and your brother and sister get?&quot; and he knew and I told <br/>
him &quot;That&#39;s math!&quot; And then, when he&#39;s playing games on the <br/>
computer/game cube, he can read &quot;Game over&quot;, &quot;Loading&quot;, etc etc! <br/>
*LOL* So, what I&#39;m getting at is Rory only attended preschool for <br/>
two years (of which he had a BLAST!) and half day K for a year and <br/>
he&#39;s ALREADY thinking that you can&#39;t learn unless you are in school <br/>
or sitting with workbooks. I really didn&#39;t think he&#39;d have that <br/>
notion. But then, when my MIL ran up one side of my husband and down <br/>
another regarding her worry and concern about the kids&#39; education.. <br/>
maybe now I know why he&#39;s so fretful himself.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll admit, I&#39;m not totally a radical unschooler. I&#39;m slowly <br/>
morphing and letting to of my overly controlling ways and <br/>
understanding and growing and loving each day. Unschooling is truly <br/>
fabulous and a very fun journey and just a super way to Be with my <br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
I am also a firm believer in doing what works for you. I just <br/>
wanted, mainly, to say hi and see if you recognized my name too!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Who needs to learn to tie shoes when there are Crocs?  :-D  Seriously,<br/>
though, this whole discussion reminded me of an episode of Inside the<br/>
Actor&#39;s Studio that I saw recently with Michael J. Fox.  He was talking<br/>
about his education and he said he never had any patience for math.  He said<br/>
(paraphrased), &quot;Two and two is always four.  What good is that?  No matter<br/>
if you do it or I do it or someone else does it, two and two will always be<br/>
four.&quot;  I thought about how true that was.  Math is (mostly) finite in the<br/>
way it operates.  Whether you learn 2+2=4 when you are 4 or 40 it is always<br/>
going to be the same.  So why not learn it when you need it.<br/>
<br/>
And it may be important to remind your son that he *is* doing math all the<br/>
time.  When he helps you in the kitchen he is doing math.  When he is<br/>
counting the blocks or red lights until you get home he is doing math.  When<br/>
he is keeping score on a game and needing to collect x-number of points to<br/>
get &quot;whatever prize&quot; he is doing math.  You can&#39;t escape from math!  It&#39;s<br/>
everywhere you look.  Just because he can&#39;t do *arithmatic* doesn&#39;t mean he<br/>
doesn&#39;t understand math.  It&#39;s ok to tell him that.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like you will be doing some remedial de-schooling after this recent<br/>
visit.  I&#39;ve BTDT myself with my family.  Fortunately now it seems easier as<br/>
the kids will just ask bluntly, &quot;Is there any reason why I should read<br/>
Shakespeare?&quot;<br/>

   Finally, someone who doesnt think I&#39;m out of my mind for sending my <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve never met an unschooler who, after really getting it, says, &quot;I <br/>
wish I&#39;d kept my child in school longer&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m glad I sent him to <br/>
school.&quot; Never.<br/>
<br/>
Cameron (now 18) went to school from pre-K through sixth grade. *He* is <br/>
glad he went because he made three really good friends. I *know* the <br/>
damage it did. Well, *he* does too, but he thinks Noah and Michael and <br/>
Matt were worth it. &lt;g&gt; But the damage was hard to undo---not really <br/>
undo, but heal from. It took a long, long time. He still has scars <br/>
(figuratively! &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
*I* didn&#39;t think I was out of my mind at the time. I thought I was <br/>
doing the absolute BEST thing I could. Private college prep. Top school <br/>
in the state. Top ten in the SE. I would have thought someone who told <br/>
me so was crazy as a loon!<br/>

you&#39;re out of your mind.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>******<br/>
When my kids are upset that they don&#39;t know something, I remind them of  <br/>
something difficult that they learned and say something like &quot;remember  when <br/>
worked so hard to learn to ride a bike? when your brain was ready, you  could do <br/>
it!  Tying shoes is just like that, your brain will be ready and  you&#39;ll <br/>
practice and practice and then you&#39;ll do it!&quot;  Someone gave me that  advise once, and <br/>
it really helps my kids smooth over those feelings.<br/>
 <br/>
As for math and the other comments being made, somewhere on my unschooling  <br/>
journey I learned that math is nothing more than permanence, pattern and  <br/>
predictability and the language (symbols) to discuss these concepts.  <br/>
 <br/>
My son can easily understand the concepts, but is unable to speak the  <br/>
language well.  Once we go into the land of symbols, it falls apart.   Anytime your <br/>
brain engages the &quot;three p&#39;s&quot;, you are doing math and that is  probably most <br/>
of the time.  Now, speaking the language is a different thing  entirely, some <br/>
people catch on easily and for some people it takes longer.<br/>
 <br/>
Which brings me to my next point.  On another list, we discuss that  some <br/>
people are visual/spatial or right brain learners.  This learning  style tends to <br/>
understand the whole concept long before the individual  parts.  Would your <br/>
son benefit by you telling him that his brain will  understand math (and that <br/>
is very cool!) before his brain will want to *do*  math? (or some variation of <br/>
that?).<br/>
 <br/>
My doctor recently tried to tell me that my son might have mental  <br/>
retardation because he couldn&#39;t do first grade math.  I said &quot;well, he CAN  do first <br/>
grade math, but not written problems....you are asking him the wrong  questions&quot;. <br/>
 Of course, that made no impact on the doctor, but I kept  thinking if my <br/>
unschooling friends were around they would totally get it!! I  wish I could take <br/>
an unschooling posse with me &lt;g&gt; (a new show?   Unschooling Entourage!).<br/>
