<div id="ygrps-yiv-2054007387">Wow this thread has really taken off! I just finished reading most of the posts, and have to say that I have been somewhat like a few posters in that I use to &quot;believe&quot; that X, Y and Z are &quot;bad&quot; foods that should be avoided at all costs. And I &quot;fed&quot; that fear to my family! Ugh!<br/>
<br/>
More recently I&#39;ve been *awakening* to the understanding that no one way in Anything is the *right* way to do that thing - whether eating sugar, or anything else in life. I have taken to asking myself this question whenever I&#39;m &quot;certain&quot; about something: <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Can I let go of being SO smart, and allow this to be other than what I think it is?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Because what I *know* is true, is only true for me. And to take it further, it&#39;s only true for me because I *believe* that it&#39;s true. And belief is just a thought that I keep thinking, and we create with our thoughts/thoughts are creative. As I accept this more and more (basis in quantum physics) I can take life and parenting less seriously, because what it means is, I am in control.** And no, I do not yet remember this all of the time, especially in the heat of the moment:-)<br/>
