Well, you should feel guilty. &lt;g&gt;    Those feelings will be part of the reason you&#39;ll be able to change.  The next time you&#39;re going to respond to your child, stop for a moment and think about what you want to say and how you want to say it and how you will appear in your child&#39;s eyes.    Then choose the words that will most benefit your child and will be the least likely to leave you wishing you hadn&#39;t said them.   It will take time.  <br/>
<br/>
Stopping to think will be really helpful. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Apologize if you say something you regret. <br/>
