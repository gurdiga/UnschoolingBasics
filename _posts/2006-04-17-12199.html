<div id="ygrps-yiv-1640306409">&lt;&lt;You have already spent $XXX on them joining this sport. The money is <br/>
non-refundable and there is no extra money to put them in another sport. Do <br/>
you just let them quit & explain that you cannot pay for another <br/>
sport/activity at this point? Do you tell them they can quit if they like <br/>
but then they will have to wait until next season to do something <br/>
different?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 Being as we haven&#39;t won the Powerball yet, we do have a budget. (Somewhere, <br/>
I&#39;ll have to find it.)<br/>
First thing, I would find a way for them to experience the sport without a <br/>
big investment. That&#39;s a lot of pressure on a little one. There are two <br/>
homeschool soccer teams within a 30 mile radius. $15.00 a season, bring a <br/>
ball and wear shin guards. Total of about 35 dollars. If there weren&#39;t any <br/>
teams I would send an email out to my local list and find others who are <br/>
interested in starting one.<br/>
Easy. No big investment.<br/>
2.  I would list the equipment on Ebay and sell it. Once it has sold, I <br/>
would say This is what we have to work with, what can we do with it?  I <br/>
would also ask for some of the money back from the team, it may not be <br/>
refunded but I would try.<br/>
<br/>
There are also LOADS of interesting things to do other than Football in the <br/>
fall, baseball and soccer in the spring. There&#39;s horseback riding, <br/>
gymnastics, fencing, running, track and field, playing catch,bowling,ice <br/>
skating, roller skating, canoeing,kayaking, swimming, diving, caving,hiking, <br/>
backpacking, climbing.......<br/>
ALL of which can be tried for a day, a week or a lifetime.<br/>
