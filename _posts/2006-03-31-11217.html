It sounds like you did a lot of fun things, that&#39;s great. But there&#39;s<br/>
nothing wrong with driving around with music blaring either. We happen<br/>

<br/>
Revering books above other things isn&#39;t necessarily helpful for<br/>
unschooling. Books and television and movies and &quot;junk&quot; and everything<br/>
in the whole world lead to learning.<br/>
By heaping judgement upon certain kinds of shows, it shuts doors for<br/>
our children. Why place that on them? Our children can freely explore<br/>
the world without judgement placed upon things that might fascinate<br/>
them. A lot of &quot;junk&quot; is great fodder for learning. By separating<br/>
shows into categories, it closes doors. It also teaches our children<br/>
to not be completely honest with us...if they&#39;re fascinated with<br/>
something you deem &quot;junk&quot;, are they really willing to share that<br/>
fascination openly? Probably not.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t revere books or certain types of knowledge above others.<br/>
My oldest child has a very intense love for World of Warcraft right<br/>
now. That is his main activity from day to day. I&#39;m glad he can freely<br/>
explore that without guilt.<br/>
<br/>
There are many television shows I would have thought &quot;junk&quot; many years<br/>
ago, but we&#39;ve had some amazing conversations because of viewing them<br/>
together...not to mention some heavy duty laughter!!<br/>
<br/>
This topic always interests me, because I work in the fasion industry.<br/>
As a child, my interest in fashion and makeup was thwarted because of<br/>
ultra-religious parents. Now I find myself both an unschooling parent,<br/>
surrounded by unschoolers that either shun fashion or tolerate it (how<br/>
many unschoolers wear makeup, I think I should take a poll!!) and it<br/>
vastly amuses me that I now make money in the fasion industry.:)<br/>
<br/>
I love the runway. I love makeup. I adore the art of film making, the<br/>
art of illusion. It&#39;s part of my passions. My folks did nothing to<br/>
encourage that interest, they actually discouraged it. But here I am<br/>
at 37 years old, pursuing my interests.<br/>
It would have been nice to be encouraged at a much younger age so I<br/>
didn&#39;t have to spend years feeling guilty about my passions. They&#39;re<br/>

of her being in Montessori/public/private school from<br/>
age 3 to start of 5th grade, and being actively<br/>
involved with all the children (not in HER classroom).<br/>
Music/radio yeah, we would do that a little. She just<br/>
had so many questions about things we drove<br/>
by---trains, bridges, construction, etc. She would<br/>
tell me to turn it down/off so she could ask me<br/>
something. I was just talking about people I have<br/>
KNOWN who had no interaction with their child in the<br/>
car, rode around just talking to their girlfriend and<br/>
telling their kids to be quiet (the rude way). We<br/>
(she) are really into Brit rock, worldbeat, and techno<br/>
stuff-KCRW-Santa Monica.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>can&#39;t afford the on line fee. My dd has made an rpg<br/>
game (rpgmaker2003)that is just coming on line. She&#39;s<br/>
been living and breathing that for months. I think her<br/>
alpha testers are still working on<br/>
it.----www.errpg.com---- I think it&#39;s ready. Why<br/>
books? Early on she made it clear that she was a<br/>
no-fluff, no nonsense, non-fiction kind of little kid.<br/>
As a full-time volunteer I built and ran her new<br/>
charter school library when she was in gr 1 and 2 no<br/>
money, no books. I got donations and got super deals<br/>
at thrift shops because they know who I was buying<br/>
books for. I&#39;m a little passionate about children&#39;s<br/>
literacy. We started unschooling after I pulled her<br/>
out at the start of the 5th gr. It seems I had been<br/>
unschooling her her all along. She made her own<br/>
judgments on what she thinks is junk a long time ago.<br/>
<br/>
My other degree&#39;s in marketing. We&#39;ve watched a little<br/>
of everything--our favorite thing now is to identify<br/>
the demographics of shows. She has never liked Barbie<br/>
or Disney. At 4 she asked me to come in her room and<br/>
take out all the books that are &quot;not true stories&quot;.<br/>
She loved fables, though, from all over the world.<br/>
We&#39;ve watched and talked about junky shows, too. She<br/>
is more of a culture critic (snob)than we are<br/>
(especially aout consumerism).&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(Pris)I guess I was lucky. My parents fed my<br/>
 </span></blockquote>fashion interest to the extent they could with 4<br/>
girls. I wanted to go to NYC and model, but they made<br/>
me go to &quot;State U&quot;. I did go on a college trip to NYC<br/>
with all my fashion merchandising buddies (I was in<br/>
Hs&#39;ing and Interior Design).  My daughter grew up<br/>
watching &quot;Style&quot; with Elsa Klensch on CNN. When she<br/>
was little it came on twice a day on the weekend. We&#39;d<br/>
play &quot;ladies on the runway &quot; and play the Vivaldi<br/>
theme song. I&#39;m much more into fashion than she is.<br/>
She is turned off by so many converstaions like, &quot;Oh,<br/>
I used to shop at the Gap, but now all my clothes come<br/>
from the Limited II&quot;. We love Karl Lagerfeld, though.<br/>
My husband has his voice down perfectly.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is in charge of her education and is<br/>
planning her college majors-computers, psych,<br/>
religion, marketing, art---and will start with a<br/>
couple of classes this summer. <br/>
Thanks for you comments!<br/>

Classics.  I love the well written word.  Yet there are some days that I<br/>
pick up a cheap paperback novel or something really &quot;silly&quot; like a murder<br/>

C-SPAN.  Yet I also am a total Star Trek junkie (yes; a Trekkie) and will<br/>
watch it anytime I can find it on.  I love Stargate and Law and Order and<br/>
CSI (only the original one LOL!)  And there are times when a Three Stooges<br/>
Marathon is just the ticket I need.  My life is no less enriched by Larry<br/>
Curly and Moe than some nature program!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-759240478">&quot;My daughter is almost 13. I pulled her out of PS 3<br/>
weeks into fifth grade. We never did baby talk. I<br/>
never rode around in the car with music blaring---we<br/>
chatted about what we saw driving down the rode and<br/>
she learned stuff from me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 Oh wow, we LOVE to do baby talk!  The boys and I come up with all sorts of<br/>
goofey and fun ways to talk to the baby and get his attention.  He gets<br/>
babas and binkys and does poo poos, he also hears things spoken<br/>
correctly---most of the time.  The baby talk just makes things more silly<br/>
and fun!  We always have music blaring, in the car, in the house.  We chat<br/>
all the time too, and I spend a lot of time in the car turning the radio<br/>
down so we can talk as well.  It&#39;s all about having fun. <br/>
<br/>
&quot; We have lived a<br/>
life of revering books and knowledge, and watch tv for<br/>
the fun of history, PBS specials, technology stuff,<br/>
etc. We don&#39;t watch the junk on all the other<br/>
channels.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 I revere books and knowledge.  I hope my kids do as well, but that is for<br/>
them to decide.  We watch anything on TV that grabs our attention.  We&#39;ve<br/>
been watching shows about the whole Da Vinci code stuff and the Knights<br/>
Templar and the Priory of Scion.  The TV is very often on the Food Network,<br/>
my boys love watching Alton Brown or George Duran.  They even watch the<br/>
ladies of the food network sometimes, too!  They love watching Extreme<br/>
Homes, I Want That!, Design on a Dime--all sorts of informational stuff.  We<br/>
watch tons of Animal Planet, too!  We&#39;ve watched a lot of stuff lately on<br/>
Rome and the Roman Empire.  I usually put it on and get engrossed in it and<br/>
one by one the kids end up joining me.  We also have a blast watching The<br/>
Fairly Odd Parents, Sponge Bob, American Idol, Charmed various Anime shows<br/>
and a whole bunch of other &quot;junk&quot; and you know what usually happens?  We<br/>
talk about what we&#39;ve watched.  Many times, we&#39;ll talk for a whole evening<br/>
about stuff we&#39;ve watched, whether educational or not.  It&#39;s about spending<br/>
time together and enjoying each other.<br/>
