 </span></blockquote><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/strewing">http://sandradodd.com/strewing</a> has lots of stuff already written by <br/>
lots of people.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, it&#39;s helping the kids to the buffet of life - pointing <br/>
out the acorn squash with butter and cinnamon when you know they <br/>
like pumpkin pie - but not requiring they try it, not even one bite, <br/>
just making it available to them.<br/>
<br/>
Another way to look at it is this: when you and your SO first got <br/>
together, you studied that person. You looked for likes, dislikes, <br/>
favorite music, favorite foods, etc. Then, when you were out and <br/>
about living life, if you saw that his favorite group was going to <br/>
be playing a concert nearby, you&#39;d mention it. Your beloved could <br/>
say &quot;Cool let&#39;s get tickets&quot; or &quot;Thanks for the info. I really love <br/>
that group but I hate the noise at concerts.&quot; or maybe just &quot;Thanks <br/>
but no thanks&quot; You were bringing something from the world at large <br/>
into your orbit. And, maybe you&#39;d be at the music store and see a <br/>
sign that said &quot;If you like ABC and the Alphabets (your beloved&#39;s <br/>
favorite group) you might want to try Zeta and the Greeknotes&quot; and <br/>
so you&#39;d maybe listen to it, or even buy it and bring it home, or <br/>
maybe just mention it. Basically, you&#39;d be alert to things both old <br/>
favorites and new things that might spark interest and bring them <br/>
around, no strings attached (and that really important NO strings <br/>
attached).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-997700555">A few fears back as a &quot;Newbie&quot;, when I 1st saw &quot;Strewing&quot; in the <br/>
subject line of posts, I got very excited. I thought it meant that <br/>
somebody else had a handle on coping with a child that constantly <br/>
strewed her belongings evry which way! :) I am not a &quot;clean freak&quot;.  I <br/>
accept that unschooling supercedes fastidiousness, but I did hope to <br/>
find a solution to the mess. <br/>
<br/>
I now realize that my DD is simply using the same tool that Sandra <br/>
offers. My DD is sharing what is interesting to her in the hope that I <br/>
will join in & learn something with her! Chaos will rule in our home, <br/>
for the time being at least. I&#39;ll have to settle for just keeping the <br/>
safety hazards to a minimum!<br/>
<br/>
Live! Laugh! Learn!<br/>

That&#39;s hillarious!  And what an interesting discovery.  Thanks for that<br/>
new viewpoint towards my daughter&#39;s strewing!<br/>
