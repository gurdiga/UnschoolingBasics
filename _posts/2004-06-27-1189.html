<div id="ygrps-yiv-370562197">With the talk of toddlers,messes and bedtimes, I just thought I&#39;d <br/>
share a little bit of last night and today with Jalen (3).<br/>
<br/>
I got home from a four day stint of work (long days, two of them an <br/>
hour away in Mobile) around 5pm last night. I was totally exhausted <br/>
mentally and physically. By 11pm, I couldn&#39;t hold my head up and <br/>
told Jalen I was going to lay down.<br/>
He nursed a bit, then popped out of bed and said &quot;goodnight Mom&quot; and <br/>
headed out into the living room with dh and older boys.<br/>
I have no idea what was going on out there, I suppose he watched <br/>
some tv with them. In a bit (as I&#39;m bordering the edge of <br/>
consciousness) he came in and curled up with me in bed. He put his <br/>
little arms around me and just snuggled for a few minutes, then <br/>
popped back up.<br/>
This happened once or twice more. One of the visits, I asked him to <br/>
close the bedroom door on his way out, saying &quot;thanks Jalen&quot; when he <br/>
complied. &quot;Welcome Mom&quot; I heard from the hallway. So sweet.<br/>
Finally, dh was coming to bed. He said &quot;Jalen, Mom is going to <br/>
sleep, if you want to come lay down now&quot; (also asking Trevor and <br/>
Jared to keep an eye on him if he needed anything).<br/>
About two minutes later he came into the dark room and snuggled up <br/>
to nurse. He was out in no time!<br/>
I thought it was really sweet the way he would be out with everyone <br/>
else, then decide he needed some Mom loves and come in where I was <br/>
laying down. <br/>
<br/>
Just now, he found a bag of old plastic Easter eggs and started <br/>
throwing them around the room. I felt that familiar twang of &quot;damn, <br/>
I don&#39;t want to clean those up!) but I watched and listened. He was <br/>
throwing bombs, a wonderful twinkle in his eye.<br/>
 After he was done, he moved on to the kitchen, where I was cutting <br/>
up some broccoli. <br/>
&quot;TREES!&quot; he said joyfully. I cut him a &quot;tree&quot; and he immediately lay <br/>
down on the kitchen floor and went into a fantasy world. He was <br/>
talking to something and telling it about &quot;big trees&quot; while standing <br/>
the broccoli upright, taking a small munch every once in a while.<br/>
I picked up the eggs, while he played in broccoli land (naked by the <br/>
way, from his earlier foray into a full kitchen sink).<br/>
My naked little broccoli boy.:)<br/>
<br/>
I guess my sharing is to illustrate that when playful exploration <br/>
becomes the focus, the bedtime/food/clean up issues are secondary.<br/>
They still exist, but the focus is different.<br/>
My hang ups still exist, but I&#39;m aware enough to not let them come <br/>
into the forefront of our lives (most of the time anyway:)<br/>
<br/>
Someone asked about the deschooling process and whether we ever <br/>
completely deschooled. I don&#39;t know the answer to that.<br/>
I haven&#39;t completely in some ways. I don&#39;t think I can undo 13 years <br/>
of my life and the thought processes that went with it. Rather than <br/>
trying to pretend like those thoughts, and that lifestyle didn&#39;t <br/>
exist, I simply accept it as part of me. It&#39;s part of who I am...all <br/>
those experiences are mine. I&#39;m ok with that now.<br/>
If you become aware enough of those schoolish thoughts, that they no <br/>
longer control your choices or actions, then you&#39;re deschooled.<br/>
I don&#39;t think that means the primal reactions necessarily go away <br/>
completely, or thoughts don&#39;t pop up occasionally, unsolicited.<br/>
It&#39;s there, it&#39;s part of my past, but it doesn&#39;t have to dictate my <br/>
life today.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for sharing!  This was great.  :)<br/>
Sounds a lot like my house-though bedtimes aren&#39;t an issue for us.  <br/>
The girls fall asleep on their own fairly early in the evening from <br/>
exhaustion.  lol!  I am very thankful for this!<br/>
<br/>
With my youngins, well lets just say that anything can make it into <br/>
the house.  From frogs to rocks to..........  We have a frog in the <br/>
frontroom right now.  lol!  DH and ds are mowing lawn, so the girls <br/>
have to be inside.  6yr old dd had a frog when they told her it was <br/>
time to come inside and the frog followed.  lol!  Poor thing will be <br/>
lucky to escape alive.  He is supposed to be going to live in the <br/>
garden.  <br/>
<br/>
Seems we always have a learning mess here.  I have gotten used to it <br/>
now, but it was a hard transition.  The biggest thing that helped me <br/>
was getting organized.  Having everything (my stuff) in its proper <br/>
place.  We also went to the extent of organizing toys into groups and <br/>
boxes to help with clutter.  The girls can pull out a large tub of <br/>
legos to play, or a large tub of puzzles to play, or block...well you <br/>
the picture.  We are trying to gently teach about putting away things <br/>
when you are done, so you have room for the next project.  It works <br/>
some days and not others.  <br/>
<br/>
I just love watching my kids learn and play.  There is just nothing <br/>
better and I feel sorry for all the families that miss this by <br/>
sending their children away to &quot;school&quot;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hey, thank you a million times over for this post , Ren. It could not have <br/>
come at a better time for me. My dd is 2yrs10mos, and very busy and fun. But <br/>
right now I am grumping at her for throwing things around, not so available when <br/>
she needs me, a little impatient at her for a lot of things, then wondering <br/>
why she is being so needy of me and so unhappy. To hear this stuff from you can <br/>
make me sit down and think about what I am doing and why. I appreciate this <br/>
look into your time with naked broccoli boy Jalen, and I will go have tea with <br/>
naked tea girl Lesley Ann.<br/>
