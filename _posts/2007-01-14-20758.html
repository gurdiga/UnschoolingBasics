<div id="ygrps-yiv-889486604">This may be old news for some but we just discovered, while playing <br/>
around on the Lego website, under downloads there is a program - FREE - <br/>
that lets you build Lego creations on the screen.  It is called Lego <br/>
Digital Designer.  You can then see and print the instructions for your <br/>
completed project...you can even go further and send them to Lego and <br/>
receive, (after payment for the bricks) the complete package in the mail <br/>
with the pieces necessary and directions for your model!  You can even <br/>
design the packaging!!  How cool is that.  Ethan and Claire were up till <br/>
midnight playing around with the features.  You can also save and share <br/>
your creations in the online gallery.<br/>
Amazing...and FREE!!!<br/>
<br/>
Have fun,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1524448972">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
That sounds very cool.  Could you send the link.  I went to the lego <br/>
site and couldn&#39;t find it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2072000768">Hi All,<br/>
   What a great idea!<br/>
  I went to the site & found nada, though.<br/>
  Even did a search.<br/>
  Would you mind putting a link on here?<br/>
  Thanks,<br/>

    You can explore the universe looking for somebody who is more deserving of your love and affection <br/>
  than you are yourself, <br/>
and you will not find that person anywhere.<br/>

&quot;club&quot; and &quot;downloads&quot;.  The club is great too because you get a great <br/>

Tyler will enjoy that.  He is shadowninja95.  He was<br/>
on just a little while ago.  Let me know if Will would<br/>
like it, and when he will be on, and I will get Tyler<br/>
on there too.  He is having alot of fun on there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1512540054">My son signed up on Lego.com several months ago and is very <br/>
disappointed that he hasn&#39;t received his free lego gift that he <br/>
thought he was supposed to get.  Did we do something wrong?  Also, I <br/>
think he would love to interact with others on this site.  How do you <br/>
go about that?  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
