<div id="ygrps-yiv-1366367913">I have a 6 yr old who is currently in a five point harness type of seat. He<br/>
has told me yesterday how much he hates that seat and does not want to use<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-335514134">Have you thought about a booster seat? We went to that with our daughter at about the same age and have gone with that earlier with our son. We told them that it would help them see out the window better and keep them safe in case of an accident.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1246226726">Not sure what state you are in but in NC the law is they have to be 8<br/>
yrs old or 80 lbs.... (good to have the age too since my now 18 yr old<br/>
would have barely made it out based on weight! HA!)  <br/>
<br/>
My second child really hated the carseat... just hated it!   We had<br/>
the 5 pt harness and it felt like it squished her legs, we tried<br/>
various other ones and still she felt squished and uncomfortable... we<br/>
did however take the 5 pt harness off the booster seat when she was<br/>
over 40 or 45 lbs whatever the guideline was and just used the car<br/>
seat belt over her booster.  She was much happier with that<br/>
arrangement!   We did try hard to limit our car time until we could<br/>
rid ourselves of the 5 pt harness but it wasn&#39;t easy!  There were many<br/>
days I waited until Daddy was at home or arranged for her to play with<br/>
a neighbor to avoid her having to go in the car.   <br/>
<br/>
Not sure what type of seat you are using for your child but wanted to<br/>
point out that most 5 pt harness seats are only rated up to 40 lbs or<br/>
so, I think there are some rated higher and your child may be quite<br/>
slender and not be over the 40 lbs at age 6... my current 7 yr old is<br/>
really tall and muscular so he is 60 lbs..with him we have switched to<br/>
a small booster that just gives him some height in the car (which he<br/>
really doesn&#39;t need!)  and keeps the seatbelt from bothering his neck.<br/>
 If you are still feeling that according to your state&#39;s law etc that<br/>
he needs to be in some sort of car seat perhaps you can take him to<br/>
the store and try out different ones and see if there is something<br/>
that makes him happy to use. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck!   I am so waiting for July 27th next year so we can toss<br/>
the car seats until grandchildren!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-165640079">We went through that recently. Once Ethan was big enough to ditch the car<br/>
seat, Ryan wanted none of it. We compromised by using the car seat with the<br/>
regular seat belt. One day Ryan went in a friend&#39;s car and that mom used the<br/>
5-point restraint. After that he didn&#39;t car about the 5-point restraint<br/>
anymore.<br/>

after the picture at L&L. I did try the booster seat which stated on the<br/>

liked it way!! better.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-636058245">1 - check the laws in your states - some have age/weight/height<br/>
requirements so that may be a factor<br/>
2 - does he really need to be in a 5 point harness at 6 yrs old or would<br/>
a booster and lap/shoulder belt work as well?<br/>
3 - if a 5 point harness is necessary for some reason, can you check<br/>
into other models/styles - perhaps this one is just not a good fit at<br/>
this point.<br/>
<br/>
FWIW as soon as DS was old enough/big enough to be out of a car seat, he<br/>
was out of the car seat. He sits in the middle of the back seat in the<br/>
pickup with the lap belt and he can sit in the middle (lap belt) or<br/>
sides (lap and shoulder) in my Saturn. He&#39;s 10 now and has been out of<br/>
additional restraints (additional as in beyond what a standard vehicle<br/>
contains) since he was 5 or 6 years old - oh also he is and always has<br/>
been in the upper range for age in height and weight. If he was a<br/>
&quot;peanut&quot; like one of his cousins, we might have chosen differently.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1451519096">My son (5) was jealous of his friend&#39;s booster seat until we got him a<br/>
Graco Nautilus, it&#39;s a 5 pt until 65 lbs and a belt positioning<br/>
booster from 30-100 lbs.  He may be more willing to use the 5 pt<br/>
harness since it LOOKS like a booster.  If my son grows out of the<br/>
harness at 6 (shoulders level with the top slots, I doubt he&#39;ll reach<br/>
the weight limit before then) I would be completely comfortable with<br/>
him being in a booster then.<br/>

with two that come up from the floor, between the legs, called anti- <br/>
submarine belts). So anyone whose hero is a race car driver would have  <br/>
something in common right there!<br/>
