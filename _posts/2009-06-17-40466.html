Not that you should not ge it. But I know what it is to be on a budget.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-530503121">One of the things &quot;I&quot; love about Rue&#39;s book is that it is very <br/>
down-to-earth and practical - it is simple and straightforward and an <br/>
excellent description of real honest-to-goodness interactions between <br/>
parents and children. I always hear Rue&#39;s own gentle and clear voice <br/>
very clearly when I read it. It describes my own family&#39;s reality very <br/>
very accurately. And it doesn&#39;t rely on any kind of belief system or <br/>
other philosophy or anything - it is just so simple and concrete. <br/>
Doesn&#39;t seem pie-in-the-sky or anything like that, to me, at all.<br/>
<br/>
But, there have been occasions where I have found  myself defending <br/>
Rue&#39;s book like this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No, really. Seriously. It is true. ALL true. I KNOW them personally and <br/>
I know lots of other people who live the same way. MY family lives the <br/>
same way. No, really. Seriously. It is true....&quot;.<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt;  You know, I thought it would be but, while it helped my dh to<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;  understand a bit better, he said it was too &quot;utopian&quot; or &quot;perfect&quot;,<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;  like it wasn&#39;t real!<br/>

Yeah, it really is true, but the best part of its being true is that  <br/>
they&#39;re also wonderfully quirky and weird (I consider this a VERY high  <br/>
compliment.) and normal (well, normally weird.). I mean...have you MET Jon  Kream? If <br/>
not, you should.<br/>

He&#39;s the epitome of &quot;quirky&quot;, which is exactly what I love about him. Rue&#39;s quirky too, in a more sweet and gentle way.;) Quirky is good in our world. And they really DO live exactly what she wrote in the book. Promise.<br/>
