<div id="ygrps-yiv-1842394512">Hi, I&#39;m talking about stuff! I liked the long list of ideas that were <br/>
at the end of Parenting a Free Child: an Unschooled Life. We have a ton <br/>
of those things, but I&#39;m looking for more! My son is 7 and right now he <br/>
is interested in building with anything(cardboard/popsicle <br/>
sticks/string), experiments, music...everything really. So, what are <br/>
all of you stocking your homes with? Thanks in advance :)</div>

mostly loved making his K&#39;nex, Legos, string, sticks,<br/>
rubber bands, etc etc work together.  Now we have a<br/>
pumpkin chunking machine is our driveway. We had two<br/>
but one turned back into its parts just this morning.<br/>
Show him this site:<br/>

and let his imagination run wild. All of our machines<br/>
have been made of &quot;finds&quot;. Check Craigslist or<br/>
Freecycle. They are our favorite source for ideas and<br/>
stuff. We even have a sailboat and trailer we got for<br/>
free...he said he wanted to learn to sail... <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2137120289">Toilet paper tubes (plus paper towel tubes, wrapping paper tubes), pool<br/>
noodles, PVC pipe, duct tape (the latter 3 items can be built into<br/>
&#39;boppers&#39; - good for sword battles without damage), huge boxes of craft<br/>
sticks, yarn, string, k&#39;nex, legos, sketchpads, pens/markers (DS has<br/>
never liked crayons - too lacking in fine detailing ability, he&#39;s a very<br/>
linear drawing type person, lots of mazes, and buildings, and monsters<br/>
in detail but not colored in), books, DVDs (Netflix), magazines,,<br/>
assorted cardboard boxes (whole and flat) - cereal boxes are great for<br/>
making things like gameboards, just thick enough to be sturdy but light<br/>
enough to cut easily into little &quot;markers&quot; and such. Then there&#39;s baking<br/>
powder, vinegar, and other kitchen stuff (put a raw egg in a container<br/>
of white vinegar and let it sit overnight - the shell dissolves but the<br/>
inner membrane is intact and it sucks in fluid and swells up (osmotic<br/>
action if you need &#39;schoolese&#39; stuff to log). Carefully drain the<br/>
vinegar and replace with white corn syrup and let sit again. It shrinks<br/>
down to golfball size (reverse osmosis as the fluid is sucked out<br/>
through the membrane). <br/>
 <br/>
There&#39;s other stuff too but that&#39;s a short list... (lol)<br/>

I&#39;ve never tried the corn syrup part---we&#39;ll have to do that. (Does it <br/>
have to be &#39;vinegarized&#39; first? I guess so.)<br/>
<br/>
But too after the vinegar bath, it&#39;s kind of rubbery and bouncy. Really <br/>
cool---a bouncy egg!<br/>
<br/>
ANd you can also soak chicken bones (and other small bones) in <br/>
vinegar---they&#39;ll turn &quot;rubbery&quot; too. In high school, I soaked the <br/>
skeleton of the frog I dissected in vinegar and had a &quot;rubber&quot; frog <br/>
skeleton---really snazzy! &lt;G&gt; Freaks aunts out! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1031112378">I made tortilla soup this weekend. I made the chicken stock and added a cut<br/>
lime to the simmering pot. I&#39;d never done that before ..<br/>
<br/>
While I was taking the meat off the bones I noticed the ribcage looked like<br/>
and felt like cartridge and not bone. All the other bones looked normal. Do<br/>
you think this happened because of the lime juice?<br/>

Hmmm.<br/>
<br/>
Does it alter the taste?<br/>
<br/>
I just boiled down a turkey carcass for soup. I guess I&#39;ll have another <br/>
on Friday. &lt;g&gt; How much vinegar do you use?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Does it alter the taste?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Depends on what kind and how much vinegar you use. Plain white vinegar <br/>
(my least favorite) just a tablespoon to a large pot of water is not <br/>
really noticeable but does have the benefits (and the bendable bones). <br/>
A good &#39;glug&#39; of cider vinegar into a large pot adds a bit of savory <br/>
to the stock but not enough to be very noticeable once you use it - <br/>
leaves people going &quot;What in the world was in that? It was really good <br/>
but I can&#39;t quite identify all the ingredients&quot;. If you really -want- <br/>
to taste it no questions asked, a nice dash of good balsamic vinegar <br/>
will stay with the stock and flavor whatever you use it in (and darken <br/>
it somewhat too). So, it really depends on how you intend to use the <br/>
stock and your own personal taste buds and those of your intended <br/>
victims..uh..guests :-)<br/>
