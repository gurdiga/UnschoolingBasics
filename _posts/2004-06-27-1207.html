Well you&#39;ll be happy to know, that Ren&#39;s beach party is now officially the<br/>
next Live and Learn conference!:) So you can take one trip and get it ALL<br/>
in. <br/>
I expect all of you to start saving money to come hang out with me at the<br/>
beach, and listen to some great unschooling speakers.<br/>

Oh, how exciting...you don&#39;t know HOW happy you&#39;ve made me today!  I just <br/>
mentioned it to DH and he was up for it, too.  Ren...can you tell me again <br/>
exactly which &#39;beach&#39; we&#39;re talking about?  Seems like I remember that is was on the <br/>
FL gulf coast, right?? I wanna start looking into accommodations!  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
