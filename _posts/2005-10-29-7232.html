<div id="ygrps-yiv-1392560467">Joanne.  Hi.  LOL.  I love how you put it.  Detoxing.  That is what <br/>
deschooling seems like to me.  I&#39;m new to unschooling myself.  Have<br/>
read and read for years but am just now doing any real transitioning.<br/>
{Yay! --- You&#39;ll see what I mean by that.}<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday dh and I conflicted after ds hit me on the head with a wooden<br/>
<br/>
train toy.  I was dozing on the couch and ds was trying to get my <br/>
attention.  I was mad because pain does that to me but wanted to<br/>
discuss <br/>
it with ds without distractions in order to make sure he understood<br/>
--NO <br/>
don&#39;t hit people.  At the same time dh was mad at ds and wanted to have<br/>
<br/>
a few words.  After I disagreed, dh went off at me about playdough on <br/>
the floor which bugs the fire out of him.  I said we are confusing the <br/>
issue and it is looking to ds like I am at fault when things go wrong<br/>
if <br/>
dh talks about side issues like playdough, and that I want ds to know <br/>
not to hit people.  That was all said in the moment.  I managed this <br/>
time to keep my head and stay with the issue without delving into side <br/>
arguments.<br/>
<br/>
Dh has not read indepth on unschooling or gentle parenting (and I <br/>
haven&#39;t insisted).  Later on I said I need dh to either trust what I&#39;m <br/>
doing in avoiding what comes &quot;naturally&quot; (the way I was raised-- <br/>
spanked, shamed, coerced, you name it) and soaking up info about gentle<br/>
<br/>
parenting which dh agrees to in principle OR get up to speed and parent<br/>
<br/>
with me because ds is 2 and obviously needs us now.  For the first time<br/>
<br/>
ever, dh actually said &quot;ok.&quot;  A breakthrough.  Today dh has been <br/>
following my lead on a few things and supporting what *we&#39;re* doing as <br/>
parents together.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I agree with Heidi that kids are only little once and we either play <br/>
with them or miss the boat.  Sometimes try to beat him to it and ask if<br/>
<br/>
he wants to play tag.  He would probably enjoy you asking him.  My ds<br/>
is <br/>
not 3 yet and incredibly active, even more than when he was a younger <br/>
toddler.  I&#39;m sure he&#39;s only getting started.  He absolutely LUVs <br/>
activity.  Sedentary, that&#39;s me.  It&#39;s pushing me and I figure boning<br/>
me <br/>
up for when ds is much stronger like 5.<br/>
<br/>
Then I read in bed a while as ds crawls around on me and finally<br/>
settles <br/>
to nurse and sleep.  He&#39;s getting the message that settle down routine <br/>
is here to stay.  He dozed off around 1AM last night.  I used worry <br/>
about it but now I&#39;m used to it. Sometimes it&#39;s 3AM before sleep comes<br/>
on.<br/>
<br/>
I agree it takes time to learn to listen to your body and me and dh<br/>
still have a way to go on that one OURSELVES.  We aren&#39;t settled on our<br/>
natural rhythms.  I&#39;m wondering if it&#39;s because bedtimes and wakeup<br/>
were<br/>
enforced our whole childhoods.  We&#39;re both very resistant and<br/>
rebellious <br/>
about it and also have a way to go about not accepting fussiness from <br/>
one another about it.  The same with food and tv control or any other <br/>
kind of control.  Baby steps.  We will get there.  It&#39;s amazing how <br/>
over-controlled children turn into bothered adults.  At least that&#39;s my<br/>
<br/>
experience, if my perspective is right.  In any case, it doesn&#39;t do<br/>
well <br/>
for modelling to ds.  So yet another thing we need remedies for.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t have much advice on this one except sometimes we do have to <br/>
&gt; buck up because the kids are only little once and there will be a <br/>
&gt; day when you wish you could play tag again.  The other thing is to <br/>
&gt; talk, talk, talk so that he understands your need to settle down <br/>
&gt; after dinner.  I have that problem later in the night.  I need to <br/>
&gt; read before I fall asleep, it is my way to settle down.  My kids <br/>
&gt; know that when it comes around 10:00 mom is in her room settling <br/>
&gt; down and if they need something they should probably ask before <br/>
&gt; then.  We have been through it enough times that they just know <br/>
&gt; now.  I usually do the 1/2 hr reminder, &quot;okay, mom is headed to the <br/>
&gt; bedroom, anyone need anything before I settle down?&quot;  Of course, <br/>
&gt; they know if there is something important, that they can&#39;t handle on <br/>
&gt; their own, I will be there. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Remember too that it takes time for kids to listen to their bodies <br/>
&gt; and to recognize what they need and how to go about getting it when <br/>
&gt; they have been told what to do and how to do it before.  They learn <br/>
&gt; a lot from our model too.  <br/>
