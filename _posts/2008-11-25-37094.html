<div id="ygrps-yiv-1965713197">Hi, I&#39;m Cat.  I&#39;m a 26yo mom of 4 girls.  Melissa is my only <br/>
one &quot;officially&quot; doing anything this year, she&#39;s 5 1/2 and in K.  <br/>
Lydia is 4 1/2 and in pre-k, but she does K level work by her own <br/>
demand (very competitive child, she loves to try and keep up with her <br/>
sister in many areas and found that academics is the *only* way she <br/>
can do so because her mind is hardwired to process information more <br/>
logically than Melissa&#39;s is, that one is hardwired creatively like <br/>
me)  I also have Kimberly, 3yo in January, and Jordan, 14 months old <br/>
(we call her JoJo).  Yes, that is a lot of girls LOL  Anyway, we <br/>
started last school year for Missy&#39;s pre-k year, and I listened to <br/>
the hype that we had to use a program for things and she had to be <br/>
doing x, y, and z by the end of that year, and it was a complete and <br/>
utter disaster for us until I packed up all the school stuff for us <br/>
to move over the summer.  So I still have 3 boxes of schoolbooks and <br/>
materials still mostly unpacked in my garage LOL  And I learned that <br/>
maybe unschooling isn&#39;t such a bad thing after all...........  I&#39;ve <br/>
been intrigued by the concept of unschooling for a while, and now <br/>
here I am pretty much doing it.  Well, once I get myself deschooled <br/>
so that I&#39;m not longer thinking that we have to compartmentalize what <br/>
schooling is (may take a while, I went through preschool and a few <br/>
years of college on top of public and private schooling- yes I did <br/>
both as a kid lol-  for K-12)<br/>
<br/>
So all that to say, Hi from Ohio! lol</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-78537545">Hi, Cat, I&#39;m Meredith mom and stepmom to Mo and Ray, respectively. <br/>
I&#39;d have to look up what &quot;grade&quot; Mo&#39;s in, she&#39;s been unschooled from <br/>
the beginning (she&#39;s 7) and I rarely think about any of that hoo-haa <br/>
unless its time to fill out paperwork. She&#39;s happy and energetic and <br/>
seems to be on the go all day long. <br/>
<br/>
I happen to know Ray&#39;s &quot;high school age&quot; bc the filing requirements <br/>
in our state change at that point... and it costs more. We do some <br/>
reporting to his bio mom, too, so periodically I have to think about <br/>
what Ray really does and translate all of that into &quot;areas of <br/>
concentration&quot; and &quot;learning objectives&quot; blah blah blah. He&#39;s been <br/>
homeschooled and gone to public school in the past, and radical <br/>
unschooling has been the absolute best! He&#39;s such a pleasure to live <br/>
with! <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I used to have all sorts of &quot;educational materials&quot; I&#39;d picked up <br/>
over the years. I still have some of the books - some older science <br/>
textbooks with really gorgeous illustrations, yummm. I hang on to <br/>
things that interest me, or I think one of the kids might want <br/>
someday - doesn&#39;t hurt to have stuff around after all. Have you read <br/>
this?<br/>

Last spring, though, I noticed I was throwing away &quot;math <br/>
manipulatives&quot; - something I thought for sure I&#39;d never do! But they <br/>
don&#39;t combine with any of our other building toys, and we&#39;d lost a <br/>
bunch, so there didn&#39;t seem to be any reason to keep the things. It <br/>
was interesting to realize I&#39;d gone from &quot;omg, we Have to have These! <br/>
they&#39;re So Useful&quot; to tossing them in the trash with the shells of <br/>
used felt-tip pens. <br/>
