FIRESLAE DEAL<br/>

 <br/>
Dear Friends,<br/>
 <br/>
Please read to see why... for the next FIVE days...<br/>
you have one last chance to get our best<br/>
homeschool resource package ever...<br/>
 <br/>
Here&#39;s the story:<br/>
 <br/>
Next week out here on the homestead (D.V.) we will finally be able to do<br/>
something we&#39;ve NEVER been able to do before...<br/>
 <br/>
Turn on the outdoor water spigot and actually get WATER from our own well!<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever mentioned this before...<br/>
 <br/>
But over the past 12 months, I have spent several hours each and every week<br/>
HAULING water to our house in our big old black farm truck (named &quot;Old Blue&quot;<br/>
 but that&#39;s another story). Every week... summer, fall, winter, spring, and<br/>
summer again, I&#39;ve  made trip after trip from the feed store down the road<br/>
to our house, filling up our water tank & hauling 250 gallons at a time back<br/>
here to the house, to take care of our household needs.<br/>
 <br/>
When you live beyond the sidewalks and the county water lines, sometimes you<br/>
do what you have to do. WE have learned to be &quot;water misers&quot; and make do<br/>
with low water pressure, quick showers, and fewer flushes. Lots of fun!<br/>
 <br/>
It wasn&#39;t always this way, but it hasn&#39;t been MUCH  better...<br/>
 <br/>
I had rigged up a &quot;temporary&quot; pump in our well for the first six years we<br/>
were here, which enabled us to pump H20 up to a 55 gallon barrel... and then<br/>
siphon it by water hose down to cistern behind our house. Hardly an<br/>
efficient system, especially in cold weather, when my hands would freeze<br/>
along with everything else and the whole system would lock up as tight as an<br/>
ice drum.<br/>
 <br/>
Well, my &quot;temporary&quot; (HA HA) set up blew a gasket last summer, and ever<br/>
since then -- inbetween putting out newsletters and hauling loads of H2O --<br/>
we&#39;ve tried to get someone out here to help install a really, truly, honest<br/>
to goodness<br/>
deep well pump for us so we could have REAL water and REAL water pressure in<br/>
the house.<br/>
 <br/>
But we found this isn&#39;t easy out here in the boonies... and it isn&#39;t cheap,<br/>
either.<br/>
 <br/>
First you have to dig the water line trench from the pump to the house and<br/>
lay your line...<br/>
 <br/>
Then you dig out a huge hole for a well house...<br/>
 <br/>
Then you build the &quot;in the ground&quot; cement and cinder block well house...<br/>
 <br/>
and then Finally, you install the deep well pump and hook it all up!<br/>
 <br/>
All this takes time & patience, big guys with backhoes & cement mixers...<br/>
and money.<br/>
 <br/>
Providentially, after 11 months of searching and waiting, this past two<br/>
weeks we were able to have our trench dug...water line laid... a hole dug<br/>
out for our well house... foundation poured... AND our well house actually<br/>
BUILT.  Blessings all!<br/>
 <br/>
The only thing left now is to buy our pressure tank & switch box, and then<br/>
get our pump guy over here to set the pump, hook it all up, and turn on the<br/>
spigot...<br/>
 <br/>
...And then find a way to pay for all of this activity.<br/>
 <br/>
I tell you all the &quot;behind the scenes&quot; story to explain why we&#39;ve decided to<br/>
make our<br/>
HOMESCHOOL RESOURCE FIRESALE available one last time -- and that is to<br/>
raise the funds we need to pay for all these blessings.<br/>
 <br/>
So, here you go... If you missed this before, here&#39;s one last chance at a<br/>
wonderful package of OVER A DOZEN of our best homeschool resources at a   b <br/>
a  r  g  a  i  n -basement p r i c e...<br/>
 <br/>
JUST FIVE MORE DAYS, and then we&#39;re done....<br/>

 <br/>
You&#39;ll get an incredible deal... and we&#39;ll appreciate your support<br/>
 <br/>
... and next week, we will thank you when we turn on the spigot and dance in<br/>
the<br/>
spray!<br/>
 <br/>
Best Wishes,<br/>
