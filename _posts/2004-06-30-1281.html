<div id="ygrps-yiv-239321025">Thank you to everyone who responded and gave me support and ideas.  I think I <br/>
just need to continue the &quot;letting go process&quot; and support him in a loving <br/>
way and not push him, regardless of what happens with PS (who knows, if he&#39;s <br/>
held back maybe his mom will come around and agree to homeschool!).  I appreciate <br/>
all the ideas for ways to support him in a fun way without pressure.  This <br/>
was very helpful to me!<br/>
 <br/>
Hugs to everyone...<br/>
