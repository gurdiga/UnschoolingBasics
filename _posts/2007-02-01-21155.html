<div id="ygrps-yiv-902077264">Check with folks who are local to you about it, they&#39;d have more<br/>
specifics. From what I know of folks in NY, many use the PASS test which<br/>
is designed to be administered casually at home, designed for home<br/>
educating families. Maybe also read on sandradodd.com regarding testing<br/>
and how to make it &quot;invalid&quot; in your eyes while satisfying the crossed<br/>
t&#39;s and dotted i&#39;s of the legalities. Note that testing doesn&#39;t start<br/>
until what would be &quot;4th grade&quot; and is only done alternate years until<br/>
grade 9. So, 4th, 6th, and 8th would be tests, 1st-3rd, 5th, and 7th<br/>
could be narrative/alternate method, then testing every year for &quot;high<br/>
school&quot;. The &#39;composite score&#39; of the test must be above the 33rd<br/>
*percentile* (that&#39;s not percent, it&#39;s percentile - that means that of<br/>
those taking that same test at the same general timeframe, 1/3 do worse<br/>
than your child and 2/3 do better - not all that hard really. If 12 kids<br/>
take a 100 question test, 3 kids get 1 question correct, your child gets<br/>
2 questions correct and the rest get 3 questions correct, then even<br/>
though the score would be 2%, it would also be at/above 33rd<br/>
percentile).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thank you I was not given that test as an option but if it is not  standard perhaps that would be why. I will look into it thank you for the help. I am stressing over this a ton . This is one of the many many reasons i took my children out of public school to begin with the whole testing to make sure everyone is the same the pressure to &quot;make the grades&quot; learning is supposed to be fun and an adventure at every age. Not fitting into a predesigned mold. (sorry ranting)<br/>
thanks for the advice<br/>
