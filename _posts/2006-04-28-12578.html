&quot;Salvador Dali Melting clocks are not a problem in your reality. You <br/>
are an unschooler. You will tolerate a textbook, but only as a last <br/>
resort. Mud is your friend. You prefer hands-on everything. If your <br/>
school had an anthem, it would be Dont Worry, Be Happy. Visit my <br/>

have books on animal husbandry laying on my table and kitchen island and <br/>
I *would* invite people over to see the baby chicks, though I don&#39;t know <br/>
that I&#39;d compare them to parents or anything like that.<br/>
<br/>
My husband said if the house &quot;smells like your husband&#39;s farts&quot; was not <br/>
an option then the quiz couldn&#39;t possibly reflect real life. ;)<br/>
