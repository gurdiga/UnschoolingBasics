<div id="ygrps-yiv-1410403946">&quot;What you were missing was she did not want the item, just your<br/>
attention&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think we should assume the toy/item was not important to the<br/>
child. We have control over our financial choices (yes, sometimes the<br/>
finances don&#39;t support the desires, but we&#39;re of a developmental stage<br/>
that it&#39;s easier to understand that) and if we really examine our<br/>
choices, there is often an imbalance where children are concerned.<br/>
<br/>
I catch myself sometimes....yeah, I&#39;m going to get that chocolate bar<br/>
for myself, but no, we can&#39;t buy that toy today. duh.<br/>
I think part of my challenge, is having four children. A &quot;treat&quot; for<br/>
myself is cheap. A &quot;treat&quot; for one of the kids has to be multiplied by<br/>
four ususally!  There are times I notice an inconsistency in my<br/>
willingness to spend, and I think that&#39;s a good thing to examine.<br/>
<br/>
If we really don&#39;t have enough money, that&#39;s one thing. But sometimes<br/>
we value certain items above others and that isn&#39;t fair to our child<br/>
with the desire.<br/>
<br/>
If your child chooses something you deem &quot;worthy&quot; is it more likely to<br/>
get purchased?  <br/>
<br/>
I think we need to take our children&#39;s desires seriously, while also<br/>
modeling thoughtful choices in consumption. In the case we&#39;re<br/>
discussing, it didn&#39;t seem like the mother was saying &quot;no&quot; for any<br/>
good reason....I can just about bet that a huge part of the whining<br/>
was that child seeing the hypocrisy of the &quot;no&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
A child will pick up on an arbitrary &quot;no&quot; in a heartbeat! They&#39;re<br/>
amazing that way. If you buy yourself a coffee, a magazine then say<br/>
&quot;no&quot; to your child&#39;s desire for a hot wheels, they&#39;re going to whine<br/>
because you&#39;re a hypocrite!! Good for them.<br/>

tracks that did fantastic things.  We knew they were pieces of crap<br/>
from reading reviews on them and from friends&#39; expereiences.  To Keon,<br/>
though, they were the bomb.  He asked for them relentlessly.  We tried<br/>
to explain that they didn&#39;t do like they did on tv.  We took him to a<br/>
friend&#39;s house that we knew had one.  The asking didn&#39;t stop.  Finally<br/>
we bought him the one he had been eyeing the most.  It failed<br/>
miserably and never did preform as shown on tv.  He was SO<br/>
disappointed.  The good thing, though, is that it forced  Dan and I to<br/>
seek out a Hot Wheel&#39;s system that *would* work (as shown on tv) and<br/>
we did eventually find two.  (BTW, one is a motorized &quot;car shooter&quot;<br/>
that whips a car around a loop and runs on 2 batteries and the other<br/>
is a model that you hang from your door and sends the cars flying down<br/>
a long ramp which can then fly through a hoop of &quot;flames&quot;)<br/>

 <br/>
That has happened with us, but it has also happened that the kids wanted  <br/>
something that I just knew was a horrible purchase....and they LOVED it!!   <br/>
Sometimes they don&#39;t always play with them as you think they will.<br/>
 <br/>
We try to do plenty of discussion when the desired item is expensive or at  <br/>
least seems not worth the money.  When the kids trust that I have  their <br/>
interests (and not just &quot;best&quot; interests), they are comfortable with some  input <br/>
from me.  <br/>
 <br/>
I learned from another unschooling mom to have lots of casual post-purchase  <br/>
discussion, like &quot;did you like that toy? did it do what you wanted? what would <br/>
 you change about it?  what is your favorite part?  is this something  you <br/>
would buy a friend?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
This has nothing to do with whining.  :)<br/>
