<div id="ygrps-yiv-1701378612">Hi Joy.<br/>
   <br/>
  When I read the last part of your message, I became frightened. No wonder you are concerned about you father-in-law. This goes far beyond being pushy or disagreeing, his behavior is irrational and dangerous!<br/>
  What does your husband say to his behavior, especially when he is driving with a bag over his head? Is he trying to stop and reason with his Father? <br/>
  If not, you have to make clear to him, that this is affecting the safety of your children, not just a convenience or a nuisance. In this case I would set clear boundaries with your husband first. For a few days, until you have had a chance to agree in detail with your husband how to deal with this dangerous behavior, stay clear of them. <br/>
  Then enforce them strictly. <br/>
  The second part of the issue you have raised, there is a blatant disrespect toward your authority as a mother - just because you are unschooling does not mean you are not in charge of your life and your household. This part will take more time to really help you with each issue. But for now, focus on the first part of the problem, keeping your kids safe.<br/>
  I also offer you my services - email me, privately, if you wish, so we can work on whatever part of this issue you want to, together. As a homeschool coach, I will not charge anyone on this list for my services, so feel free to contact me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:cjblanton123@...">cjblanton123@...</a>.<br/>
   <br/>
  Hope this helps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1112568194">I doubt that you will get far on this issue unless your dh supports you or at least will not interfere and when you do as you must.  <br/>
Ideas:<br/>
*a statement of your need for increased privacy without defensiveness but without apology <br/>
* a schedule of visiting hours<br/>
*a requirement that they call ahead<br/>
* an honest discussion of how it hurts kids to be put in the middle of these conflicts<br/>
*an ultimatum that if your needs for increased privacy and cooperation aren&#39;t met then they will see the kids less<br/>
  Really I&#39;ll bet that you already thought of these ideas and others, so I guess there is some reason you doubt these will work, such as not feeling supported by your dh, or not liking to cause &#39;problems&#39;, etc.  In-laws are so sticky!!  Whew!  Cameron<br/>

<br/>
Hi.  I would like a little advice on an issue.  I live next door to<br/>
my in-laws (which includes two adult children still living at<br/>
home).  They mean well, but they all are constantly at my house to<br/>
see my two children.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
How about inviting them for supper and telling them you have something <br/>
very important to discuss with them all.<br/>
<br/>
Tell them that you love them very much but that you&#39;re feeling that <br/>
they aren&#39;t treating you as the *parent* of your own children. You feel <br/>
that you need to have the *right* to be your children&#39;s parent (so to <br/>
please back off)---and that, since you are *homeschooling*, you need at <br/>
a minimum 8:00-3:00 for &quot;school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Tell them (almost) what you told us and exactly what you need and <br/>
expect.<br/>
<br/>
Let them know that you will revisit the topic weekly (maybe even plan a <br/>
Sunday dinner each week for all of you ---or Tuesday steak night or <br/>
Wednesday homemade pizza night) to let them know how it&#39;s working for <br/>
you. You can take that time each week to show them what the children <br/>
have done &quot;school-wise.&quot; That way they will know they get one night <br/>
each week that *you* devote to them, specifically. They get to see and <br/>
play with the kids and find out what they&#39;re interested in. Maybe the <br/>
kids would like to put on a short play r puppet show or something for <br/>
the grands or something.<br/>
<br/>
The following week do it all over again; but if they don&#39;t follow your <br/>
guidelines, you could get a little more emphatic. If they aren&#39;t <br/>
playing along, you can eventually tell them that you WILL refuse to let <br/>
them see their grandchildren if they won&#39;t play nice. But then you HAVE <br/>
to do it---at least for quite a while.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
For example, we have been outside for several hours and it is getting<br/>
dark and I say we need to go inside now.  The grandfather might<br/>
say, &quot;oh let her stay out longer&quot;.  I then say, &quot;no, we really need<br/>
to do &quot;x&quot;.  He keeps on and at this point my child is running in the<br/>
opposite direction.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
When it *is* time to go in now, simply scoop up your child, start <br/>
walking towards the house, and say, &quot;See you tomorrow!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How you word things IS important---don&#39;t give him an &quot;in&quot; to play his <br/>
games.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=--<br/>
<br/>
They also will ask my child to &quot;ask me&quot; things they know that I won&#39;t <br/>
allow.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Like what?<br/>

wonder you are concerned about you father-in-law. This goes far <br/>
beyond being pushy or disagreeing, his behavior is irrational and <br/>

<br/>
Yes, it is.  I am not exaggerating in any way.  He is well-known for <br/>
his foolish behavior.  People around here just laugh it off.  <br/>
Luckily, nobody has been hurt seriously...yet.  It really ticks me <br/>
off.<br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt;  What does your husband say to his behavior, especially when he <br/>
is driving with a bag over his head? Is he trying to stop and reason <br/>
with his Father?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Everyone mostly laughs about it.  You CANNOT reason with him (FIL).  <br/>
He just doesn&#39;t &quot;Get It&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt; If not, you have to make clear to him, that this is affecting <br/>
the safety of your children, not just a convenience or a nuisance.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My husband agrees and is concerned about their safety.  We have a <br/>
strictly enforced rule that our kids are never left alone with any <br/>
of them.   <br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt;   The second part of the issue you have raised, there is a <br/>
blatant disrespect toward your authority as a mother - just because <br/>
you are unschooling does not mean you are not in charge of your life <br/>
and your household. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You have nailed it on the head.  They have no respect for me or <br/>
anyone else for that matter.  You can&#39;t deal with people like that.  <br/>
My biggest issue was this; how do I protect my children without <br/>
letting my children know how inept their grandparents behavior is?  <br/>
Furthermore, do I even need to hide this fact from them?  I feel <br/>
torn, I am appalled by my in-laws behavior and comments, but I am <br/>
afraid to CONSTANTLY have to degrade their behavior in front of my <br/>
children.  I hope this makes sense.  <br/>
<br/>
I have found the best thing thus far is to make frequent day trips <br/>
away from home...I can&#39;t even enjoy living in my own <br/>
home/yard...sad...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help,<br/>
Joy</div>

you would do better to start with your kids.  Be sure that they <br/>
realize who is in charge and that, although the grandparents are <br/>
important people, they are not the parents.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is an enormous burden to place on a child. <br/>
<br/>
Kids deserve a loving environment in which the adults are willing to <br/>
focus on helping the kids to shine. If other adults are not willing <br/>
to help, if they are, instead, putting their own interests and needs <br/>
before those of the kids, then those adults don&#39;t need to be around <br/>
children. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes other adults want to help, but have conflicting <br/>
expectations wrt kids. That happens alot with unschooling bc our <br/>
expectations are really different from &quot;the norm&quot;. I&#39;ve been going <br/>
through this to a small extent with a guest of our close friends and <br/>
neighbors. He enjoys hanging out with children and has alot of <br/>
skills for dealing with conventional &quot;gently disciplined&quot; children, <br/>
but those don&#39;t really carry over to dealing with radically <br/>
unschooling kids. So we&#39;ve been having some conversations <br/>
specifically about my kids and their needs and how to better <br/>
communicate with them. Its taking a certain amount of trial-and-<br/>
error all around. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I want to second Kelly&#39;s whole post, and in particular the idea that <br/>
you can and should set some really clear boundaries wrt how much <br/>
time these folks &quot;get&quot; to spend with the kids. It might be helpful <br/>
to approach the discussion from the perspective of &quot;consistency&quot;. <br/>
Kids do better in a consistent environment - which doesn&#39;t mean the <br/>
same thing as having rules and being dogmatic about them (the usual <br/>
interpretation). Kids (people in general) do better when the <br/>
expectations placed on them are consistent. <br/>
<br/>
The expectations in an unschooling family are a bit different from a <br/>
rule-based family, so its important that the kids can be fully <br/>
imersed in unschooling for a big chunk of time, every day. They need <br/>
that. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1255579266">Hello Joy,<br/>
I live in a community of friends who are in and out of<br/>
each others&#39; houses all day...which means that they<br/>
are are in mine a lot.  Although I do not have the<br/>
problems that you have, I realized that I had to<br/>
preserve some of our &quot;family&quot; and private time.  So in<br/>
the end I found that putting up a laminated sign that<br/>
says, &quot;Family Homeschool Time, Please come back later&quot;<br/>
really worked.  My friends and my childrens&#39; friends<br/>
respect the sign.  Not sure if it would work in your<br/>
situation but I suppose it couldn&#39;t hurt to try.  I<br/>
also have  another sign called, &quot;Family Time&quot; for when<br/>
we need space (meals, reading, playing games, etc.). <br/>
You might just want to have a &quot;Homeschool Time&quot; sign<br/>
since your in-laws would consider themselves part of<br/>
your family.  Even if you are unschooling, not<br/>
schooling at home, it can be nice to preserve your<br/>
boundaries!<br/>
Hope that helps.<br/>

you would do better to start with your kids.  Be sure that they<br/>
realize who is in charge and that, although the grandparents are<br/>
important people, they are not the parents.<br/>

I&#39;ve been off the computer for a week, but I wanted to address this and <br/>
not leave it as is.<br/>
<br/>
Obey? Punishment? &quot;The hard way&quot;??  Who&#39;s in charge?<br/>
<br/>
None of this is mindful or respectful.<br/>
<br/>
Exactly what do you think you daughter learned? I know what you were <br/>
trying to *teach*---but what do you think she actually *learned*?<br/>
<br/>
Better to &quot;sit the sister/grandparents down&quot; and lay down the law with <br/>
*them*.<br/>

 I&#39;ve been going<br/>
through this to a small extent with a guest of our close friends and<br/>
neighbors. He enjoys hanging out with children and has alot of<br/>
skills for dealing with conventional &quot;gently disciplined&quot; children,<br/>
but those don&#39;t really carry over to dealing with radically<br/>
unschooling kids. So we&#39;ve been having some conversations<br/>
specifically about my kids and their needs and how to better<br/>
communicate with them. Its taking a certain amount of trial-and-<br/>
error all around.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend too, who is very good at dealing with schooled kids. <br/>
He&#39;s a magician and handles large groups of schooled kids really, <br/>
really well. That&#39;s his bread and butter.<br/>
<br/>
I asked him to help with the first conference (Emcee the talent show <br/>
and do some other magic stuff). It was a disaster---he had NO control, <br/>
and he didn&#39;t know what do with with no control! &lt;G&gt; If it weren&#39;t so <br/>
painful for me to watch, it would have been funny.<br/>
<br/>
Those of you who came to the first conference surely remember (or maybe <br/>
it wasn&#39;t as painfully obvious to everyone else---I don&#39;t know). But it <br/>
struck me HARD!<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s so much better around my kids---after years and years of watching <br/>
us with them, but I still don&#39;t think he could handle as many kids as <br/>
we have now at the conferences! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
