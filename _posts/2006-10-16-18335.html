<div id="ygrps-yiv-893030806">My 5 yo ds is always asking me how they make stuff.  Today it has been matchbox cars, eye glasses (he just got his first pair today), marshmallows (we looked that up and will try it soon), etc.  I was wondering how to find this information.  I don&#39;t need a history, just a brief video or maybe description (like a Mr. Rodgers&#39; thing).  We will be getting netflix in a few weeks if that opens possiblities.  <br/>
