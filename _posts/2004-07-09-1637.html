<div id="ygrps-yiv-1259368032">That&#39;s a stupid subject line...I am tired and I have had a less than <br/>
joyful day (cleaned up a whole box of cat crunchies and about $100 in <br/>
pennies off the floor, sat on couch to catch my breath and found <br/>
breadcrusts and ants in the cushions, etc).  But I am confused about <br/>
William.  I see you guys talking about how kids will approach things <br/>
when they are ready, but it seems like Will is hungry and demanding <br/>
to learn things before he is ready...<br/>
An example is the Solar System.  He was 14 mos old when he found a <br/>
map of the solar system in a book.  He would point to each of the <br/>

since had out every book our library has on the solar system and the <br/>
universe and will tell you all sorts of amazing things.  Yet when we <br/>
look at the night sky, he points to Venus and Mars and always <br/>
asks &quot;Where is the Earth.&quot;  I have explained every way I know how <br/>
that we are on Earth and he just doesn&#39;t seem to get this.  Today he <br/>
asked me who is John Kerry and I told him he wants to be president <br/>
and he said &quot;George Bush is our president.&quot;  And then &quot;What is a <br/>
president?&quot;  How am I supposed to explain that to a 2 year old?  And <br/>
then there is Shakespeare.  He found my copy a while ago and he wants <br/>
me to read it to him every day because it is a &quot;William book,&quot;  (he <br/>
sees his name on the front of the book).  But I can hardly understand <br/>
it myself and so how on earth am I supposed to translate it for him?  <br/>
I mean, I guess I don&#39;t have to, he just sits and listens for as long <br/>
as I will read it and only asks what specific words mean not what is <br/>
going on but my gosh, come on, this seems so weird that he wants me <br/>
to read this to him. He cannot be understanding it.  <br/>
I don&#39;t know what my specific question is here I guess I am just <br/>
frustrated and rambling.  It is so weird to be dealing with a child <br/>
who has learned to read and tell time etc at 2 but yet cannot <br/>
understand that I cannot hold him while we are driving. (yes, I pull <br/>
over, that isn&#39;t what he wants...he wants me to hold him while we are <br/>
driving).  And he gets so frustrated w me!  Today he asked for his <br/>
money and I gave him his bank.  He was counting pennies and <br/>
said &quot;Mama give me 700 million bucks.&quot;  I laugh, tell him I don&#39;t <br/>
have that kind of money and he gets SO MAD demanding that I give him <br/>
700 million bucks.  Finally I wrote him a check and that did calm him <br/>
down!  Isn&#39;t this crazy?  Do any of you have a kid like this?  I <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-255803337">Hey, I just wanted to come back because I was feeling bad about this <br/>
post...please don&#39;t think I am complaining about William.  I am not.  <br/>
I think he is amazing and wonderful!  I am frustrated w myself and <br/>
feeling stupid...seems like my two year old is smarter than I am and <br/>
I have a hard time figuring out how to explain things to him and am <br/>
frequently baffled by his questions and he gets really pissed if I <br/>
tell him I don&#39;t know something....<br/>
Just was watching my sweetie sleep and feeling guilty for this post.  <br/>
I am not complaining about my baby and I wouldn&#39;t change him if I <br/>
could.  It&#39;s just hard to deal w the dichotomy of him being <br/>
so....don&#39;t know what word to use...I&#39;ll say intelligent...but then <br/>
being only 2 years old and limited in his ability to understand.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2135231047">I know that some folks that unschool say that every child is gifted, but  <br/>
yours sounds to me to be extremely gifted!  I know it must be hard, but  don&#39;t <br/>
squash that thirst for knowledge that he has!  Look for some message  boards <br/>
with other parents dealing with children like yours, it might help.  <br/>
syndi<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;...since  we can&#39;t know what knowledge will be most needed in the future, it <br/>
is senseless  to try to teach it in advance. Instead, we should try to turn <br/>
out people who  love learning so much and learn so well that they will be able <br/>
to learn whatever  needs to be learned.&quot;<br/>

it now.  He wouldn&#39;t ask you if he wasn&#39;t interested.  KWIM?  :)  If he <br/>
started crawling at 4 months old would you tell him that he wasn&#39;t <br/>
ready and sit on him?  LOL  Obviously silly question, but I wanted a <br/>
silly analogy.  Allow him the freedom to learn what he wants to know <br/>
when he wants to know it.  Don&#39;t throw a bucket of water on his fire.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Find a clip in a movie where you start out in space and zoom in closer <br/>
and closer until you&#39;re right at ground level ON Earth so he could see <br/>
that that creamy blue planet is the one he&#39;s standing on.  There&#39;s lots <br/>
of movies that have a reverse zoom.....the first Men In Black movie has <br/>
that at the very end.  You don&#39;t need to show him the entire movie.  <br/>
Does Contact have a shot like that in it?  I can&#39;t recall.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that&#39;s not all that unusual for a child to be interested in our <br/>
solar system.  I have two posters in our home that were picked out by <br/>
my DS when he was 2 or 3.  He thought they looked so cool and bright.  <br/>
He knows all the planet&#39;s names because he wanted to know their names.  <br/>
My DD is now 3 and she knows them too.  If they&#39;re asking for <br/>
info....just give it to them.  :)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I tried explaining that one to my kids when they were very young (when <br/>
they asked) and came up with something along the lines of our president <br/>
is like our country&#39;s daddy.  His job is to make sure that we&#39;re safe <br/>
and food and water and to help people live happy lives and have jobs.  <br/>

is and maybe he isn&#39;t.  Either way, just read to him and have a good <br/>
dictionary next to you that you can reach for.  If he thought it was <br/>
drivel or over his head or b o r i n g then he wouldn&#39;t keep asking you <br/>
to read it.<br/>
<br/>
My son isn&#39;t Einstein, but he is very interested in things that <br/>
children often aren&#39;t known for being interested in.  However, maybe <br/>
other kids aren&#39;t interested in them too because they don&#39;t know about <br/>
them or their parents shoo them like chickens toward &quot;things for <br/>
children&quot;.  Your son sounds wonderful!  Just embrace him and his <br/>
interests and help him learn what he wants to know.  That&#39;s why you&#39;re <br/>
there, Mama!  :D<br/>

~~~<br/>
He wants to know who John Kerry is.  I wouldn&#39;t use the &quot;daddy&quot;  analogy, <br/>
because president&#39;s change, and it could lead to thinking that daddy  could <br/>
change, too.  <br/>
 <br/>
Still, it&#39;s a good idea to relate things to his actual life...perhaps you  <br/>
could help him notice that the mail carrier changes from day-to-day (ours does), <br/>
 that the mail carrier is the &quot;caretaker&quot; of the mail, in the same way the  <br/>
president is the &quot;caretaker&quot; of the country.  Or the sanitation workers or  the <br/>
grocery store bagger or another person your son sees regularly.<br/>
 <br/>
As for whether you know something or not...how about saying, &quot;Let&#39;s find  <br/>
out!&quot; instead of &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;  Read him the Shakespeare.  When he  asks for <br/>
meaning of a word you don&#39;t know, show him the dictionary and offer to  look it <br/>
up.  It may be that he will choose to look at the dictionary and go  off on a <br/>
tangent that way, or he will rather hear the story.  Does it  really matter if <br/>
understands the story or not?  He&#39;s learning things and he  obviously has a <br/>
thirst for knowledge.  <br/>
 <br/>
As for where&#39;s Earth in the night sky...have you ever just pointed at the  <br/>
ground instead?  How can he understand he can see Venus and Mercury and not  <br/>
Pluto?  How about drawing a picture of the solar system and then drawing a  <br/>
picture of you and him on Earth?  <br/>
 <br/>
It sounds like it&#39;s going to take a lot of imagination with this kid. AND  an <br/>
ability to discern his real questions.  I will say that most 2-4 yo&#39;s  will <br/>
ask questions over and over just to get a reaction, and if he sees you&#39;re  <br/>
getting frustrated it may be paying off for him in some way...whether it&#39;s  <br/>
knowing that he has your full attention as long as you&#39;re frustrated and  <br/>
exasperated, or he likes the intellectual stimulation of the argument.  I  would <br/>
encourage you to think about your answers to his questions  carefully.  Many times <br/>
what kids are saying is not what they&#39;re really  asking.  Asking him to clarify <br/>
what he means could save you a lot of  frustration.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-562909855">Millie, I read this and your follow-up, and I thought: This is a kid who <br/>
REALLY needs never to go to school!<br/>
<br/>
As challenging as this may be sometimes, unschooling will be very, very easy <br/>
if he stays like this. You won&#39;t have to worry if he&#39;s learning, and you won&#39;t <br/>
be worried that he doesn&#39;t have enough interests.<br/>
<br/>
As far as answering his questions, just do the best you can and be prepared <br/>
to say, &quot;Let&#39;s find out,&quot; a lot. You don&#39;t have to know everything. You just <br/>
have to be a resource for him so that he can get the info he needs.<br/>
<br/>
Read Shakespeare to him, and don&#39;t try to explain it. If he has a question <br/>
you don&#39;t know, try to find out. Maybe he understands it and will be able to <br/>
explain it to you someday! Or maybe the sounds of the words make him feel good.<br/>
<br/>
Will sounds like a really cool, fun kid. Think about coming to the the Live <br/>
and Learn Unschooling conference in August. Be prepared to spend lots of time <br/>
at the library. Bring him lots of places, not just &quot;little kid&quot; places. Decide <br/>
that your family is all about learning, and explore the things you want to, <br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
I think once you stop worrying about it, you guys are going to have a blast. <br/>
Just don&#39;t send him to school and mess it up. ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1138056720">Millie, huge hugs to you for working hard to keep up with Will. I&#39;m <br/>
often over whelmed by my Very Verbal Boy and Mikey seems darn easy <br/>
compared to Will! And it&#39;s hard to find people to vent to who don&#39;t <br/>
say &quot;send him to preschool&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
I tryed to find some kids&#39; books by people named William, but didn&#39;t <br/>
have a lot of success. One thing that came up on Amazon is &quot;Bravo, <br/>
Mr. William Shakespeare!&quot; by Marcia Williams, aimed at 9-12 yr olds. <br/>
You guys might like that. There are some kids books by Willaim Steig--<br/>
I&#39;ve never read any of them. <br/>
<br/>
Most of what I learned from dealing with Mikey at 2 is what NOT to <br/>
do, so I&#39;m going to have to think hard to give you any good ideas, <br/>
lol. He wants to interact with you more than anything, so having <br/>
the &quot;right&quot; answer isn&#39;t as important as having fun. He wants to be <br/>
right, so say okay, here&#39;s 700 million dollars--don&#39;t worry, he&#39;s not <br/>
going to be harmed by thinking he has it, kwim? If I don&#39;t know the <br/>
answer or don&#39;t understand the question, I used to get frustrated, <br/>
but now I chant to myself &quot;the point is to carry on the conversation&quot; <br/>
while saying &quot;hmm, I&#39;m not sure how to answer that. Did you know <br/>
that...&quot; If he wants to try again to ask me, he does, but if he just <br/>
wants to keep the conversation going, we do that!<br/>
<br/>
HTH, I&#39;ll try to think of more...<br/>

<br/>
Millie!   Make a &quot;William&quot; book.  Type up some pages of the adventures of<br/>
Will and draw little doodles in the margins and put it in a binder and<br/>
write his name really big on the front.  <br/>
<br/>
Work on volume two when you can.  ; )   They&#39;ll make him happy and in<br/>
your old age they&#39;ll be a sweet remembrance of all these wonderful days.<br/>
<br/>
I read Shakespeare to Dylan when he was young.  Some volumes now have<br/>
teeny little translations in parenthesis of the unusual or out of date<br/>
words, so you could explain if he asked.  I wouldn&#39;t try to explain<br/>
unless he did ask.  <br/>
<br/>
If he likes poetry there&#39;s lots of &quot;William&quot; poets.   William Cullan<br/>
Bryant, William Butler Yeats, William Carlos Williams, William Vaughn<br/>
Moody, William Blake (some good anti-schooling poetry there!&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When Dylan was very small he found a set of solar system books at the<br/>
library by Isaac Asimov.  They had wonderful artwork and we checked them<br/>
out over and over again.  Dylan too, could name the planets in order from<br/>
the sun before he was three.   Busy, interesting kids are the easiest<br/>
children to live with and unschool with because they already know that<br/>
every little minute of life is filled with new things to discover.   <br/>

I found it!  Since I first read this, I have been trying to locate a  book we <br/>
have that belongs to MY William.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s called _The Story of a Boy Named Will, Who Went Sledding Down the  Hill_ <br/>
by Daniil Kharms.  Published by North-South Books, ISBN 1-55858-214-2  (as <br/>
far as I can tell even with my glasses on, it&#39;s really tiny.)  I&#39;ll bet  you can <br/>
find it on _www.abebooks.com_ (http://www.abebooks.com)  if not  at Amazon.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s a translation from Russian, and the illustrations are beautiful.   The <br/>
name Will is featured prominently on the cover.  Maybe it will be an  appealing <br/>
book to your little boy.  <br/>

William Wegman&#39;s photo books with Weimaraners. <br/>
 <br/>
We also happened upon several books written by a woman names  Pamela Duncan <br/>
Edwards---because of the name Duncan on the cover. They&#39;re  great---beautifully <br/>
illustrated with funny stories. _Some Smug Slug_ is all  &quot;S&#39;s&quot;---alliteration.<br/>
 <br/>
_Four Famished Foxes and Fosdyke_ is full of.....yep---&quot;F&#39;s&quot; and a neat  <br/>
reference to the stages of the moon. <br/>
 <br/>
_Barefoot_ is related to the Underground Railroad---and is just stunning. <br/>
 <br/>
And _Livingstone Mouse_ is looking for a place to live---and finds &quot;China&quot;.  <br/>
REALLY sweet and beautiful.<br/>

Even if you *don&#39;t* have a child named Duncan &lt;g&gt;, her books are  wonderful! <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  But I am confused about <br/>
&gt; William.  I see you guys talking about how kids will approach things <br/>
&gt; when they are ready, but it seems like Will is hungry and demanding <br/>
&gt; to learn things before he is ready...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your William sounds so much like my son Mackenzie at that age - and he probably is &quot;ready&quot; in his own way. For instance, Mackenzie was really *really* into trains. I have a clear memory of standing by some railroad tracks with a whole bunch of broken down engines. Mackenzie was around 21 months old, I think. He was trying to tell me something, but I couldn&#39;t understand him, it sounded like &quot;Mally&quot;. He got so angry, he stamped his little foot and said &quot;Mally, mama, Mally! Two sets driving wheels!&quot; It was only a month or so later when I came across a book that mentioned that the &quot;Mallet&quot; steam locomotive (named after its inventor, Antoine Mallet) was distinguished primarily by having two sets of driving wheels and pistons, instead of one. Whoa, talk about a lightbulb moment! He was ready for much more information than I even fully understood at the time.<br/>
<br/>
Another time at around the same age just after a trip to the gas station, he asked me how our car engine worked. When I started with a simplistic description he interrupted and asked imperiously how it *really* worked. So I started with the gas tank and talked him through the fuel lines, fuel injectors, cylinders, pistons, exhaust valves, cam shaft, etc. I thought to myself that there was no way he could&#39;ve understand any of what I was saying, but I told him none the same. A couple of days later at a playgroup he was jumping up and down in a foam cylinder yelling &quot;Look mom, I&#39;m a piston!&quot; So from my verbal description, he was able to construct in his head a pretty accurate idea of what a piston does in a cylinder. After that, I made no more assumptions about what he was or wasn&#39;t ready to learn and have always just answered his questions fully to the best of my ability or said &quot;I don&#39;t know, let&#39;s look that up.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So my advice with your son would be to start by tossing out the assumption of &quot;readiness&quot; and just go with what he&#39;s interested in. Chances are, he might have some pretty deep interests that he really delves into, but a few months or years later he might move onto something else - so don&#39;t get too attached to the things he is fascinated with, just go with the flow. The train thing lasted several years for Mackenzie, but I think now if I asked him what a &quot;Mallet&quot; was, he might not remember. That&#39;s okay though, as long as he was interested in the knowledge then, it has some place in his life long-term, whether he retains the specifics or not. To this day, he can look at some kind of device and the wheels start turning in his brain, he just has to figure out how it works, how the gears mesh, what makes it tick. He just has that ability to mentally take things apart and figure out how they work. Since he&#39;s the son of an airplane mechanic (DH) and a former software geek (me), it is not surprising I guess!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; An example is the Solar System.  He was 14 mos old when he found a <br/>
&gt; map of the solar system in a book.  He would point to each of the <br/>
&gt; planets and scream &quot;DIS&quot; until I would name what he was pointing at <br/>
&gt; and soon he was naming all the planets in correct order.  And he has <br/>
&gt; since had out every book our library has on the solar system and the <br/>
&gt; universe and will tell you all sorts of amazing things.  Yet when we <br/>
&gt; look at the night sky, he points to Venus and Mars and always <br/>
&gt; asks &quot;Where is the Earth.&quot;  I have explained every way I know how <br/>
&gt; that we are on Earth and he just doesn&#39;t seem to get this.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This makes sense if you think of the ways young brains acquire information. Something like the planets is basically memorization, something young kids do relatively easily. After all, they master thousands of words in the English language in their first few years. At that age, Mackenzie knew all of the states on our U.S. Map puzzle, but when we went to Florida to visit his grandparents, he couldn&#39;t get the idea that we weren&#39;t still in Washington state. His world view wasn&#39;t big enough to extrapolate the things he&#39;d memorized on the map to actual places that were on a big round planet that were thousands of miles apart. Your son will get it eventually, but it will take a lot of little building blocks of facts and understandings before his brain is ready to grasp such an abstract conceptual fact. You can still keep explaining though, and feeding his thirst for the knowledge, just don&#39;t have the expecatation that because he can understand some facts very easily and quickly that more abstract facts will also be ready to fall into line, it might take some time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Today he <br/>
&gt; asked me who is John Kerry and I told him he wants to be president <br/>
&gt; and he said &quot;George Bush is our president.&quot;  And then &quot;What is a <br/>
&gt; president?&quot;  How am I supposed to explain that to a 2 year old? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I just told my kids that he&#39;s the leader of the place that we live in. And that we get to choose who the leader is, every few years. So the leader might change. As they have gotten older, my explanations have gotten much more complex to keep pace with what they can understand. Right around when my daughter turned two is when September 11 happened, now *that* was difficult to explain! Some things are tough, and you just need to find ways to break it down to the point where they can grasp it. You can always add more later when they&#39;re ready for it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And <br/>
&gt; then there is Shakespeare.  He found my copy a while ago and he wants <br/>
&gt; me to read it to him every day because it is a &quot;William book,&quot;  (he <br/>
&gt; sees his name on the front of the book).  But I can hardly understand <br/>
&gt; it myself and so how on earth am I supposed to translate it for him?  <br/>
&gt; I mean, I guess I don&#39;t have to, he just sits and listens for as long <br/>
&gt; as I will read it and only asks what specific words mean not what is <br/>
&gt; going on but my gosh, come on, this seems so weird that he wants me <br/>
&gt; to read this to him. He cannot be understanding it.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He doesn&#39;t have to, to enjoy it. I was a very early reader and at a fairly young age was mowing through every book in our house. Lots of what I read I didn&#39;t understand (I remember reading &quot;Incredible Victory&quot; in grade school, for instance.) I didn&#39;t have the context to grasp a lot of what I read, but that didn&#39;t dampen my enjoyment of it. I would just continue reading it, you might be surprised at how much he&#39;ll get out of it. When my son first started getting interested in ancient Roman history last year, he was fascinated by Julius Caesar. I told him that this man named Shakespeare had written a play about Julius Caesar and he says &quot;I know mom, that&#39;s where that quote about unleashing the dogs of war comes from.&quot; Turns out, we had read &quot;Watership Down&quot; a year or so prior, and it had several quotes from Shakespeare in it, including the famous &quot;dogs of war&quot;  one. You never know what they store away in those memory banks! That&#39;s part of the beauty of unschooling to me. Since they&#39;re not told what is and isn&#39;t important, what connections they have to store and which they don&#39;t, because their brains aren&#39;t stuffed full of knowledge that they may or may not need, they are free to make the most marvelous and intriguing connections between the things that they hear, learn, or read, and are passionate about.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t know what my specific question is here I guess I am just <br/>
&gt; frustrated and rambling.  It is so weird to be dealing with a child <br/>
&gt; who has learned to read and tell time etc at 2 but yet cannot <br/>
&gt; understand that I cannot hold him while we are driving. (yes, I pull <br/>
&gt; over, that isn&#39;t what he wants...he wants me to hold him while we are <br/>
&gt; driving).  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Relax, this is totally normal! Kids thirst for knowledge comes well before their aquisition of an adult-like world view. Conceptual things like why mom can&#39;t hold them while driving or where the earth is in relation to other planets will come with time. In the meantime, just keep answering questions to the best of your ability, and offer to look up anything you don&#39;t know. In time, he&#39;ll be looking stuff up himself.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And he gets so frustrated w me!  Today he asked for his <br/>
&gt; money and I gave him his bank.  He was counting pennies and <br/>
&gt; said &quot;Mama give me 700 million bucks.&quot;  I laugh, tell him I don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; have that kind of money and he gets SO MAD demanding that I give him <br/>
&gt; 700 million bucks.  Finally I wrote him a check and that did calm him <br/>
&gt; down!  Isn&#39;t this crazy?  Do any of you have a kid like this? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know about other folks, but this sounds like pretty normal 2 y.o. behavior to me. They are not really rational beings, LOL. When they are bright and inquisitive, it just gives them greater ability to find things to drive you crazy with. But this is a good thing. Sometimes, at that age, the best you can do is reflect their feelings back to them and offer alternatives. &quot;You&#39;re frustrated because you&#39;d really like me to give you 700 million bucks, but I don&#39;t have that much money. We can make play money together, or I can write you a check.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I <br/>
&gt; would love to find another Mama to talk to who has dealt w this kind <br/>
&gt; of thing. Sorry for all the rambling but I am feeling highly <br/>
&gt; frustrated and stupid and am really hoping to hear a btdt.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, 2 year olds can be quite a handful, especially if their brains are going a million miles a minute, but they don&#39;t really have the context yet to understand what limitations there are in the real world. It&#39;s great to have this kind of inquisitive and imaginative child, but they can be a challenge. Keeping up with their quest for knowledge is definitely a full-time job! I have definitely dealt with this two times around now (my youngest is almost 5) and at times it has really tried my patience and other times has been the most incredible thing I&#39;ve ever been a part of. It sounds like William is an amazing kid who will keep you on your toes for many years to come. Kids like this make it easier in many ways to unschool because their natural curiousity takes them in so many fascinating directions. The challenge is how to fit in everything that they want/need to learn/do/see/experience. Just cut yourself and William some slack, don&#39;t expect that because his brain is motoring along that his world view will keep pace. Even with a very inquisitive brain, it just takes time to aquire the knowledge and make the connections to begin to understand the world around you. Kids like this will test every single assumption you might have, but the journey is very worth it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1168718441">I have a book recommendation for you.  It&#39;s _Protecting the Gift_ by Gavin DeBecker.  He is a security expert and this book is written for parents.  He has some great, practical advice that you can share with your children including telling them that should they ever be lost to ask a woman for help since a woman is far less likely to be a predator.  <br/>
 <br/>
My kids are still young--6, 4 and 18 mos. so I haven&#39;t had to deal with them being out in the world much without me.  I&#39;m not one who thinks telling my kids not to talk to is the least bit protective.  I&#39;ve seen parents tell their kids to beware of strangers and then turn around and get mad at them when they don&#39;t respond to polite inquiries from people they don&#39;t know in the grocery store.  I found the above mentioned book when I was looking for an alternative to the traditional &quot;stranger danger&quot; approach for protecting kids.<br/>

 <br/>
Unlike schooled children, who are apart from their mothers most of the  day <br/>
and from early on, unschooled children are with us almost all the time.  Or <br/>
with a trusted friend/family member. We don&#39;t tell them to go off with  strangers <br/>
on a daily basis----like they do in school. <br/>
 <br/>
My younger son, never schooled, has a healthy fear of the unknown. My older  <br/>
son, eight years at school,  is the one I&#39;d worry more about. We  pushed <br/>
shaking hands with strangers, making eye contact, and other &quot;adult&quot;  greetings for <br/>
strangers with Cameron (16). Duncan (8) is wary of people who come  up to him <br/>
and stick out their hands in greeting. I think that&#39;s more of a normal  <br/>
response from a child---if you really think about it. But we seem to push that  <br/>
&quot;firm handshake/eye contact&quot; greeting dangerously early, IMO.<br/>
 <br/>
There just isn&#39;t much of an opportunity for Duncan to be alone with a  <br/>
stranger. Not  like there was for Cameron, who was gone most of the day on  a campus <br/>
full of strangers (not to mention field-trips!).<br/>
 <br/>
And age has very little to do with it. I know of an 18 year old girl  <br/>
(legally an adult) who disappeared 12 years ago. I used to babysit her and her  <br/>
brother.  God! Dale would be 30 now!<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ll tell Duncan and Cameron how icky somebody we meet makes me feel. How  <br/>
there&#39;s something about that guy that makes me uncomfortable. How I just don&#39;t  <br/>
trust so-and-so. I never make them kiss or hug strangers or even family <br/>
members  if they don&#39;t want to. I like for them to tell me when someone makes them  <br/>
uncomfortable too, and I make sure I&#39;m right there if we have to deal with <br/>
this  person again for any reason.<br/>
 <br/>
My father&#39;s a shrink. He was the forensic psychiatrist for SC for several  <br/>
years. As Cameron&#39;s gotten older, I tell him stories of weirdos my father knew.  <br/>
PeeWee Gaskins was a real winner. This freak actually wrote a book. A couple <br/>
of  scenes stand out in my mind. Cameron&#39;s 16 and has a car, so I think he&#39;s <br/>
more  than ready to know the more graphic stories I&#39;ve told him. He&#39;s very  <br/>
tender-hearted, so I DO worry about his picking up hitch-hikers or handing out  <br/>
$$ to panhandlers. But he&#39;s also level-headed and really listens to me when I&#39;m <br/>
 worried. He&#39;s at the beach this weekend. &lt;g&gt; I&#39;m OK. PeeWee&#39;s dead.<br/>

I think just having them WITH you makes a huge lot of difference. As they  <br/>
get older and more able to handle details, then you can give more  information.<br/>

-----So here is an area I have been pretty much ignoring but am sort of concerned about as my kids get older, and now I&#39;m curious as to how you veteran unschoolers handle &quot;stranger danger&quot;.  I feel really uncomfortable with the whole idea of somehow making my kids fearful of the world around them by somehow describing possible future threats to them.  I have a sensitive daughter who, no matter how I presented it, I am sure would feel terrorized. I am unsure however if this makes me somehow remiss in not &quot;preparing&quot; them for some future encounter with a person who preys on children?  Should I somehow be helping them evaluate people?  Are we doing that already when we talk about people we like and don&#39;t like, so I don&#39;t need to do any more?-----<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Child Lures&quot; is a book by Kenneth Wooden.  I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re worried about sexual abuse or abduction.  The book covers both.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Stranger Danger&quot; is kinda a misnomer.  The danger usually comes from someone the child knows and who has built up trust with the child, i.e. relative, neighbor, teacher, family friend, etc.  The best way you can protect your child is to keep an open line of communication with them.  Make sure they know they should never go with someone without your permission.  If they are old enough, have a code word.  If Aunt Sue was to go by the house to pick them up when you weren&#39;t there, they&#39;d only go if Aunt Sue had the code word.  <br/>
<br/>
Make sure your child knows no one except their doctor should be touching under where their swimsuit goes.  And that if someone does, or tries to, that they should tell you immediately.<br/>
<br/>
You encourage them to not keep secrets from you and if someone (an adult -- not another 6 year old) asks them to keep a secret, be sure they know to let you know what it is.  <br/>
<br/>
For the actual strangers -- same type of things.  At the park, they don&#39;t help someone look for a lost pet or child without you right there with them.  They don&#39;t accept candy from people they don&#39;t know, etc.  Please realize that, unfortunately, the danger is not usually a stranger.<br/>
<br/>
DON&#39;T sit your child down and have a lecture on it.  Blend it in with regular activities.  When you go to the park, play &quot;what would you do, if ...?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
You can call 1-800-4-A-CHILD for more specific information.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1245963164">I need to do an intro but I wanted to comment on this.<br/>
<br/>
The two suggestions below are very good suggestions especially the second <br/>
one. <br/>
All situations differ a bit but in the end the second one is the one that <br/>
many children fear to follow. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;You encourage them to not keep secrets from you <br/>
and if someone (an adult -- not another 6 year old) asks them to keep a <br/>
secret, be sure they know to let you know what it is.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
For example: My sisters daughter for over ten years was molested and possibly <br/>
raped (she wont tell any more) by her daddy and didn&#39;t tell her mom. Her <br/>
mother being a victim of his abuse (when married to him) talked to her daughter <br/>
over the years and asked all the right questions and offered all the information <br/>
she could. <br/>
<br/>
A judge forced visitation and threatened to take custody away from her if she <br/>
didn&#39;t send the kids to see him across the US (she moved to avoid <br/>
visitation). <br/>
<br/>
The judge&#39;s reasoning was that he had never been &quot;charged&quot;* for harming a <br/>
child. Years later at 16 the daughter told her mom but only after her friends and <br/>
brother talked her into telling. The visits included the brother but the <br/>
father always would wake her and say she was kicking him and bring her to his bed <br/>
or he would send his son to the store or something. Scary but true.<br/>
<br/>
*The good news is that he was sentenced last year is now in a NH Jail. He <br/>
awaits a trial in Utah (visited the kids in a hotel, yes there also). When he is <br/>
done in Utah he will be brought back to NH (we hope) for raping me when I was <br/>
13. I didn&#39;t tell anyone myself for years because I was ashamed and in a <br/>
foster home for running away the week I was raped. He admitted to my sister what he <br/>
did and just said he wanted to know what it was like to have two sisters. <br/>
Sick I know.....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In both situations mine and my niece we both froze. We didn&#39;t yell scream or <br/>
tell even though we knew we should. <br/>
Laura<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;Make sure your child knows no one except their doctor should be touching <br/>
under where their swimsuit goes.  And that if someone does, or tries to, that <br/>
they should tell you immediately.<br/>

 I see you guys talking about how kids will approach things when <br/>
they are ready, but it seems like Will is hungry and demanding to <br/>
learn things before he is ready...<br/>
<br/>
*****I&#39;m running behind, so I&#39;m sure someone has already said <br/>
this... He&#39;s ready if he&#39;s demanding to learn. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; An example is the Solar System.  He was 14 mos old when he found a <br/>
 </span></blockquote>map of the solar system in a book.  He would point to each of the <br/>
planets and scream &quot;DIS&quot; until I would name what he was pointing at <br/>
and soon he was naming all the planets in correct order.  And he has <br/>
since had out every book our library has on the solar system and the <br/>
universe and will tell you all sorts of amazing things.  Yet when we <br/>
look at the night sky, he points to Venus and Mars and always <br/>
asks &quot;Where is the Earth.&quot;  I have explained every way I know how <br/>
that we are on Earth and he just doesn&#39;t seem to get this. <br/>
<br/>
***** Laurie did this too (although not with the Solar System). She <br/>
called it &#39;immersion learning.&#39; She&#39;d get interested in a topic and <br/>
she&#39;d check out every book on the topic from the library. I&#39;d have <br/>
to help her carry them because they were so heavy. She still learms <br/>
by immersion. She&#39;ll find out everything she can on a topic before <br/>
she goes on to something else. Sometimes, like when she&#39;s in <br/>
college, she&#39;s learning everything she can about 5-8 topics at a <br/>
time. <br/>
<br/>
Will might enjoy seeing movies like Space Camp, Apollo 13, <br/>
Armageddon, Space Cowboys (www.hobbyspace.com/Movies) and other <br/>
space travel movies. There are many sites online about space too. <br/>
www.space.com , www.heavens-above.com , www.nasa.com , <br/>
www.spaceflight.nasa.com  Is there a space center near you? Is there <br/>
a planetarium nearby? Is there any way you can get him a telescope? <br/>
<br/>
 And then there is Shakespeare.  He found my copy a while ago and he <br/>
wants me to read it to him every day because it is a &quot;William <br/>
book,&quot;  (he sees his name on the front of the book).  But I can <br/>
hardly understand it myself and so how on earth am I supposed to <br/>
translate it for him? I mean, I guess I don&#39;t have to, he just sits <br/>
and listens for as long as I will read it and only asks what <br/>
specific words mean not what is going on but my gosh, come on, this <br/>
seems so weird that he wants me to read this to him. He cannot be <br/>
understanding it.<br/>
<br/>
***** I love it! Is there a Shakespeare Festival near you so he <br/>
could see the plays that you have read? Maybe he is understanding it <br/>
and he&#39;ll translate it for you some day. ;-) Two-year olds learn <br/>
foreign languages so easily, so it&#39;s highly possible that he does <br/>
know what&#39;s going on. btw, this is exactly how Laurie learned to <br/>
read. I read to her for 3-4 hours a day from books that were <br/>
supposedly too complex for her age. pfffffttttt <br/>
  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t know what my specific question is here I guess I am just <br/>
&gt; frustrated and rambling.  It is so weird to be dealing with a <br/>
 </span></blockquote>child who has learned to read and tell time etc at 2 but yet cannot <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; understand that I cannot hold him while we are driving. (yes, I <br/>
 </span></blockquote>pull over, that isn&#39;t what he wants...he wants me to hold him while <br/>
we are driving).<br/>
<br/>
***** Is there a back road where you can let him do this? Explain to <br/>
him that you are letting him do it because there are no other cars <br/>
on the road. Laurie loved doing this with her grandfather, but only <br/>
on the backest of roads. The same with riding in the back of the <br/>
truck...something we did as kids all the time. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;Isn&#39;t this crazy?  Do any of you have a kid like this?  I <br/>
 </span></blockquote> would love to find another Mama to talk to who has dealt w this <br/>
kind of thing. Sorry for all the rambling but I am feeling highly <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; frustrated and stupid and am really hoping to hear a btdt.<br/>
&gt; Thanks for listening<br/>
&gt; Millie<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>****** Laurie is far more intelligent than I am. She grasps things <br/>
so easily that I have to struggle with. BUT I am so so so much wiser <br/>
now than I was before I had her. I&#39;ve learned with her for 24 years <br/>
now. I didn&#39;t allow myself to feel stupid (and there were plenty of <br/>
instances where I could have felt that way) but instead focused on <br/>
helping her find out what she wanted to know and therefore learned <br/>
it myself. She&#39;s still way ahead of me in the &quot;what she knows&quot; <br/>
category, but I can garden, sew and cook better than she can. ;-) <br/>

I&#39;m so saddened to hear this happened in your family.   Thanks so much for<br/>
sharing it.  I&#39;m wondering if there is anything that you feel in retrospect<br/>
would have helped you over the fear of telling ... that for instance, you<br/>
might tell your own daughter in the knowledge it could help her not keep<br/>
such a secret from you?<br/>

Joan&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
In my situation I waited until her relationship with him ended and I was <br/>
certain she would not hate me forever. So I guess in my mind I felt I somehow <br/>
asked for it and feared her and my family disliking me rather than my hurt.<br/>
<br/>
 I did attend the hearing for my closure and my niece as she was out of state <br/>
and is confused about her relationship with him. I ended up talking to the DA <br/>
and found out I was still within the allowed years to come forward on my case <br/>
(one smart thing I did do is report it but they didn&#39;t pursue it bc they <br/>
thought I made it up, in the 80&#39;s they didn&#39;t look at rape the same as they do <br/>
now). I began the process of a statement in August but found out I was expecting <br/>
so I chose to delay until after my delivery.  I dont know at this point what <br/>
to do.. I just dont know if I want to put my self or family through the stress.<br/>
<br/>
So to answer you question after thinking more I think had I known he was <br/>
beating my sister (even pregnant with a baseball bat),rapeing her in front of her <br/>
baby with a knife and driving her down dirt roads telling her to get out and <br/>
that their was someone there to kill her.. I would have screamed it from the <br/>
roof tops. She didn&#39;t tell anyone what he was doing until she left him.<br/>
<br/>
I still carry guilt over all of this. If I had reported it right away and <br/>
they charged him his daughter would never have gone through the trauma that she <br/>
did. I just didn&#39;t have the family support to feel comfort enough to confront <br/>
them when it happened. Not to mention that she (my sister) and I had run away <br/>
from home that week. The next week I was at my dads getting beaten (that&#39;s just <br/>
what he did) and a week later he forced her to marry him bc she was pregnant. <br/>
There just wasn&#39;t any time. <br/>
<br/>
I actually think my mom thought well there ya go that&#39;s what you get for <br/>
running away....<br/>
I guess im rambling now but that&#39;s my thinking on the whys and why nots.<br/>
<br/>
I just dont know how I would handle the conversations with Cassidy. Right now <br/>
she will not talk to a stranger (and some we know) and I dont make her. I <br/>
think just keeping open communication is key right now. She (or any of my kids) <br/>
have never been without us unless they are at Grammy&#39;s. I dont us sitters and <br/>
prob never will because of this experience and others in my life and my sisters.<br/>
