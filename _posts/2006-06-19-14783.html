<div id="ygrps-yiv-44887390">Okay, so I have a problem with small children goofing around in a busy<br/>
parking lot. They get that-I think they even get the why of it all. But the<br/>
little one walks more slowly than anyone on Earth &lt;g&gt;! Usual response is<br/>
dragging, nagging. Yesterday, I took a mental step back because I knew I<br/>
could not just walk off and leave him to fend for himself in a parking lot<br/>
if he didn&#39;t want to hold hands or keep up with the rest of us. I realized<br/>
it was my job to keep him safe and rather than insist that he stay with us,<br/>
I could just slow down and keep pace with him. Duh!<br/>
<br/>
I would do this for an 18 month old, but it hadn&#39;t occurred to me that the<br/>
most peaceful path here with a 6 year old would be the same. Voices in back<br/>
of head: &quot;He should know by now!&quot; &quot;Does he want to get hit by a car?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Doesn&#39;t he realize how dangerous it is to drift off into la-la land in the<br/>
middle of the street?&quot; I don&#39;t even have to pay &#39;m any mind. Just do the<br/>
next right thing.<br/>
<br/>
It has been just a matter of looking at what is really important here, what<br/>
is going on underneath this? A practice I have always done (many normal<br/>
things like sleeping in our own beds and bedtimes and naptimes and even<br/>
mealtimes don&#39;t make sense to me!) but I just get to carry it a little<br/>
further now.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Good for you!!  This sounds like my &quot;aha moment&quot; from many years ago.<br/>
Emily was a toddler and I was pregnant with Mary Elayne.  Emily had a<br/>
horrible habit of running off in the stores.  I would plead with her<br/>
to &quot;be good&quot; when we were in the stores.  Then one day that aha hit me<br/>
upside the head and I realized that I was giving her a very general<br/>
command &quot;be good&quot; rather than to ask her what it was that I expected<br/>
her to actually do.  All I really wanted was for her to stay with me.<br/>
How could I creatively get her to stay with me, not feel like I have<br/>
to fun after her all through the store (which isn&#39;t conducive to<br/>
shopping) and at the same time not make her feel like she was having<br/>
to obey my rules.  Once I could look at it from a different approach I<br/>
stopped asking her to &quot;be good&quot; and became creative in grocery store<br/>
child management :)  our shopping trips became much more fun for both<br/>
of us!<br/>
