<div id="ygrps-yiv-1980261035">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
It took me a good long time to read through all these posts, I was cooking dinner reading about everyone&#39;s wake up moments. Right now Riley (9) is touching floam for the first time, deciding it is sick. He is also watching Endurance Tehachapi. Tessa (6) is in the bath, as a distraction from yelling at her brother. She wanted to watch Sponge Bob, but really, she needs to wind down and sleep, so I am helping steer her to a safe calm place. I asked her if she wanted to take food coloring in there with her. Guess where I got that idea (the post before). Ashley, my 11 year old who goes to school her choice, is doing homework after 2.5 hours gymnastics. Riley is now stoking the fire also. Oh, Tessa is out of the tub, drying off to play play with floam. Floam has been wanted here since last Nov. and I just couldn&#39;t spend the money at the time. I found a single container yesterday, so we are finally experiencing floam. Ashley called me while I was typing, she has sore knees and loves acts of service, so I was asked to hand her her science book, 7 feet away from her and find some colored pencils. She is coloring an abstract drawing, thinking about her science homework. Tim is home with a pulled back muscle, when I started this post he was paying bills leaning against the wall, sitting on the floor. He is now tucked into Riley&#39;s bed, as far away from the house noise as we can get in our 1000 sq. ft. It&#39;s 8:31 pm here in California. Tessa has the floam booklet in front of her and telling me what the material can and can not work with. Wood, yes, glass, not so well. Now she said it&#39;s too hard, signalling me I must go Floam.<br/>

money together, if it will be worth it, etc.<br/>

They&#39;d love to have a real review of it.<br/>

  We got the boys floam for Xmas -- it was a huge disappointment. It was virtually impossible to shape, didn&#39;t even stick well to itself, much less anything else. It also smells bad -- like slime, but with styrofoam beads.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-508345493">My son loved floam but its is not that easy to work with. Of course he is only 3 and a half so now they ended up in a big ball that has dried out. But he had lots of fun just handling it. Sometimes he wants says he wants more floam to make the things he saw on TV like the volcano and the dinasour. I stilll have two tubs of green that I offer him but he says he needs all the colors and them he does not want the greens.  I think is very expensive but sinxce he wanted so much I got it for him and I trhink he has had his desired fullfilled.<br/>
