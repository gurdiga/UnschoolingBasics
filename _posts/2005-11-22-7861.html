<div id="ygrps-yiv-2146349408">My inbox is ready to burst this morning, so I hope I&#39;m not being rude for not answering everyone<br/>
individually.  But thank you to all from the bottom of my heart for all of your insight and wisdom<br/>
and advice and help!  I&#39;ve calmed down today.  I regret that my first few postings to this group<br/>
were complaints and drama.  (maybe a little seasonal depression coming on that caused me to be so<br/>
darned emotional and riled up- I haven&#39;t been myself lately.)  Dh was very sympathetic when he<br/>
came home and made sure I was ok.  I did a bit of calm thinking and started reading Teach Your<br/>
Own.  I got through the intro before CSI came on (GOT to watch CSI!) and one sentence that really<br/>
struck a chord with me was, &quot;In a nutshell, people whose lives are hard, boring, painful,<br/>
meaningless - people who suffer - tend to resent those who seem to suffer less than they do, and<br/>
will make them suffer if they can.&quot;  I never saw parenting or school in this light before.  I&#39;m<br/>
going to be more aware of this in the future.  Dh & I had a similar discussion to the one<br/>
yesterday about spanking when the kids were toddlers- well, a few times, actually.  I gave in, and<br/>
spanked the kids for a while.  I couldn&#39;t deal with the guilt, and I stopped doing it.  After a<br/>
while, he stopped, too.  He saw my methods were as or more effective, and drew his own conclusion.<br/>
 I guess that&#39;s my big lesson.  Just like you can&#39;t force a child to learn without causing him to<br/>
fear the world, you can&#39;t force a grown man to think the way you do without causing fear in him,<br/>
as well.  But thanks again to all who&#39;ve given advice, links, and support.  It&#39;s good to know that<br/>
others have been in the same situation and have had it work out successfully.  I have faith that<br/>
it will for us, too, in it&#39;s own time.   (And rarely does anything worthwhile come easily ;-})<br/>
