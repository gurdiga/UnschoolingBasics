<div id="ygrps-yiv-1090033026">&quot;I just feel like I need to be doing something more, but I don&#39;t know<br/>
what it is...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ah, what a wonderful time in your life Tina! Congratulations on<br/>
getting all of the children home..that&#39;s wonderful. Have you all read<br/>
the &quot;Teenage Liberation Hanbook&quot;? That one inspires me greatly.<br/>
<br/>
As to self excavation...I really, really love Sarah Ban Breathneck&#39;s<br/>
book &quot;Simple Abundance&quot; and &quot;Something More; Excavating your authentic<br/>
self&quot;.<br/>
If it&#39;s some form of creative expression you&#39;d like to explore, we&#39;d<br/>
love to have you come on over to the Imagination Tribe list. It&#39;s a<br/>
great place to find your creative self once again and participate in a<br/>
variety of trades with other creative spirits.:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1700908587">I would add another good read &quot;Women Who Run with the Wolves&quot; which <br/>
uses stories and Jungian archetypes (it is extremely more interesting <br/>
than that sounds LOL) to encourage women to connect with their <br/>
intuition, their creativity, and become &quot;unstuck&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-871581987"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Have you all read the &quot;Teenage Liberation Hanbook&quot;?&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have personally read The Teenage Liberation Handbook and absolutely <br/>
loved it.  Actually, it&#39;s kind of funny, because I read it while on <br/>
the bus traveling with a public school on a field trip to Chicago.  <br/>
What restraint it took to not stand up and shout to every child there <br/>
what it was I was learning.  If the school staff only knew! :-)<br/>
<br/>
I did try reading it with Amie, 16-year-old, before she came home, but <br/>
for whatever reason I couldn&#39;t hold her attention with it.  In a <br/>
perfect world we would have read it as a family.  I was SO excited <br/>
when I read it!  In fact, I just purchased it for my step-sister who <br/>
lives in Wisconsin and recently decided to take her two children, 14 <br/>
and 16, out of public school after this school year.  She was just <br/>
here this past weekend.  We live in Michigan, and she drove 12 hours <br/>
to attend our oldest&#39;s baby shower.  What a die hard she is!  :-)  Oh, <br/>
I also let her borrow Valerie&#39;s book, &quot;The Unprocessed Child&quot;, which I <br/>
totally loved by the way.  Oh...had I only known life could be so <br/>
different before I had already graduated FOUR children from public <br/>
school and tormented three others to variant degrees with <br/>
the &quot;system&quot;.  Live and Learn!<br/>

<br/>
I have &quot;Simple Abundance&quot;.  I didn&#39;t even think of it.  I&#39;m going to <br/>
pull it back out and put it by my bedside.  This would be good <br/>
timing.  I&#39;ve given it as gifts on several ocassions and have made it <br/>
all the way through at least once.  I have not heard of her other <br/>
title and will definately try to get it from the local library.<br/>

<br/>
I saw Imagination Tribe mentioned here before and signed on then, but <br/>
I&#39;ve not revisited since.  Maybe I know a little more about what I <br/>
need than I thought.  Sometimes it is nice to have someone on <br/>
the &quot;outside&quot; to grab you by the shoulders and gently push you in the <br/>
direction you&#39;re already facing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-876773861">&quot;I Could Do Anything If I Only Knew What It Was&quot; by Barbara Sher has <br/>
step by step exercises to figure out what you might enjoy and how to <br/>
use baby steps to actually TRY new things.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is a great read.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you have fun exploring all kinds of new things now that all 3 <br/>
are out of school! I can only imagine how weird that must feel at this <br/>
point.<br/>

Thanks for the positive energy that&#39;s oozing out of that statement.  I <br/>
needed it to trample my inner panic. :-)<br/>
