<div id="ygrps-yiv-299568699">Hi we are new to this group just actually happened across the site <br/>
by searching out today for extra info to add to our new coop group. <br/>
Im actually glad I happened across this group. ANyway to introduce <br/>
myself and my family. I am Becca married for 13 years (today <br/>
actually) to wounderful husband Glen. We live in Kansas dont know <br/>
that it is my favorite place to live in my lifetime but for <br/>
homeschooling regulations its one of the best states I feel where we <br/>
have our freedom to teach our kids how we feel is necessary and <br/>
needed for thier learning styles. We have 5 children and 1 on the <br/>
way. 2 boys and 3 girls. 12, 8 are the boys and 9, 6, and 4 are <br/>
the girls. This baby is to be a boy due the end of Sept. We just <br/>
started an unschooling coop group here due to the fact that a lot of <br/>
homeschooled moms dont understand what we are all about its <br/>
interesting to see their mouths drop and things come out with YOU <br/>
CANT DO THAT THAT WAY........ A lot of people just don&#39;t <br/>
understand. Its not a well known thing around this area although <br/>
traditional homeschooling is....  Does anyone have any ideas on how <br/>
to get a conference going in the area we live in....<br/>
<br/>
Im glad to be a part of this group and cant wait to get to know you <br/>
all...<br/>
<br/>
