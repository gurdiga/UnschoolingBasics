<div id="ygrps-yiv-1904600110">There&#39;s been all this great talk about college and spelling and just <br/>
what unschooling &quot;results&quot; are. I want to reiterate what Robyn <br/>
mentioned, about the important things in life if your child were to <br/>
die.<br/>
I hate pulling this card, but a dear unschooler I know lost her <br/>
child almost two years ago. January will never be the same for me <br/>
again, because I think of the Wilkinsons and dear, sweet Sam every <br/>
year at that time. They were SO thankful that they spent every day <br/>
pursuing their interests, living free from &quot;shoulds&quot; and &quot;have to&#39;s&quot; <br/>
and simply enjoying life.<br/>
<br/>
I KNOW that if myself or one of my wonderful children were to leave <br/>
their journey here, I would never, ever regret one moment we spent <br/>
just BEING. I often judge my life against the standard of death...it <br/>
helps me keep perspective clear on what is truly important. There <br/>
are so many wonderful books to read, movies to watch, mountains to <br/>
climb, sunsets to watch, debates to have and hugs to give. Why would <br/>
I waste one precious moment of my child&#39;s life assigning something <br/>
to them? <br/>
Why would I assume that MY knowledge and my opinions on what <br/>
constitutes worthy information should be matched by my child?<br/>
I won&#39;t waste their time and lives trying to tell them what I think <br/>
they should learn, I WILL however, spend every day learning with <br/>
them, about what is beautiful and worthy, and what is ugly and not <br/>
worth repeating. We will learn because we love learning and we love <br/>
living life together.<br/>
<br/>
I wrote something a long time ago, in response to the question &quot;what <br/>
do you hope your children will have gotten from unschooling by the <br/>
time they leave home?&quot; I&#39;m going to post my answer again, because <br/>
it&#39;s a good reminder for ME and I think it fits in with the current <br/>
convo&#39;s so well:<br/>
<br/>
This was originally a post at unschooling dotcom email list: <br/>
<br/>
What do you hope your kids will have gotten from unschooling by the <br/>
time they&#39;re <br/>
ready to move on from home? <br/>
<br/>
Ren&#39;s reply: <br/>
My main goal was that their sense of self would be so strongly <br/>
intact that this world could not rob their joy, their uniqueness and <br/>
their natural curiosity. <br/>
Beyond that..... <br/>
That the status quo will not matter so much to them as what is good <br/>
and right, that they would have a deep seated knowledge in their <br/>
hearts that they are intelligent, <br/>
capable human beings and can learn anything they wish.  A sense of <br/>
wonder so awesome that they will never quit seeing how magical the <br/>
world truly is.  Posses idealism tempered with realism. <br/>
Spirituality which flows naturally and freely from a loving heart <br/>
which contains kindness rare.  The ability to follow their dreams <br/>
and acheive their <br/>
goals, whatever those may be. <br/>
<br/>
And how do you plan to help that along? <br/>
<br/>
It humbles me to think about this.  I came out of High School <br/>
battered emotionally, not knowing who I was or what I realy wanted. <br/>
And fifteen years later, here I am spouting off ideals for my <br/>
children that I could not have dreamed of at the time. <br/>
<br/>
I will help that along by becoming a better person myself. <br/>
By reading ,watching ,searching and regaining that sense of wonder, <br/>
which my children have helped me with already. <br/>
By delving deep into questions and not pretending I know more than <br/>
them. <br/>
By being willing to set everything aside, change plans midstream and <br/>
go off in a new direction when necessary. <br/>
By listening carefully and responding appropriately. <br/>
By respecting thses amazing beings I&#39;ve been entrusted with and the <br/>
inner knowledge they already possess. <br/>
By dialoguing with them, these matters of the heart and showing love <br/>
to the earth and my fellow human beings. <br/>
By filling my home with books, movies, music, instruments, nature, <br/>
toys, art materials and whatever oddities my children bring home.<br/>
 <br/>
By taking them to the places they want to go and ones they never <br/>
knew existed. By fixing them new and exciting foods from other <br/>
countries and making trips to the grocery store an adventure. <br/>
By making every day an adventure with my attitude, every mundane <br/>
chore or daily activity sacred by how I approach it. <br/>
<br/>
Healing myself has definitely been the most important step in <br/>
assisting these worthy individuals in their unschooling journey.  I <br/>
have learned much from them.<br/>
Thank the heavens they came here to teach me. <br/>
