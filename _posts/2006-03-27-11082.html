<div id="ygrps-yiv-1758559255">After anguishing with our very poor soil, lots of weeds and limited sunny<br/>
places in our yard, we decided to go with Square Foot Gardening<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.squarefootgardening.com">http://www.squarefootgardening.com</a>  We got one square built and set up this<br/>
weekend and plan to do another.  In my searching for more information (like<br/>
good companions, height decisions, etc.) I found this website:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.mnsi.net/~jhlavac/gardening/squarefoot.htm">http://www.mnsi.net/~jhlavac/gardening/squarefoot.htm</a>  that has so many<br/>
links to different gardening information sites.  There are personal websites<br/>
as well as academic and professional websites.  Just a plethora of &quot;stuff.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Alicia, square foot gardening may be just what you need.  You can make the<br/>
beds with a bottom and then raise them up, so no bending over.  A great idea<br/>
for those with limited mobility, back problems, or just plain don&#39;t want to<br/>
get down on your knees!  :)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just wanted to pass that on!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I hear you!  We have horrid soil and it is choking with weeds.  Very<br/>
neglected over the past umpteen years (since way before we bought the house<br/>
2 years ago).  The raised garden with &quot;Mel&#39;s Mix&quot; is perfect.  We also have<br/>
recently started a compost bin so future gardens won&#39;t rely so much on (very<br/>
expensive) organic compost.  We are starting everything from seed as well<br/>
and purchasing (very expensive) organic seed.   I grew up doing (very long)<br/>
rows of gardening when I was a kid.  Forced to pull weeds, hoe, plant,<br/>
water, pick off bugs and harvest (which was my favorite part except for<br/>
okra).  I&#39;m glad I have the knowledge that I gained from that time but can<br/>
think of so many other ways that I could have been inspired to want to<br/>
garden rather than, &quot;Get up!  You *have* to go work in the garden now.&quot;  I<br/>
think the thing that has inspired me to expand this garden is the fact that<br/>
it isn&#39;t long narrow rows, looks pretty (or will LOL!) and that I know it is<br/>
all organic.<br/>

I&#39;m not a gardener, but I thought I&#39;d share with you an idea I saw in a<br/>
parenting magazine or somewhere.  One of the ideas was to plant a garden<br/>
with your child spelling out their name.  Each flower was planted in the<br/>
shape of a letter of their name.  It really was pretty and neat when it was<br/>
grown.<br/>
