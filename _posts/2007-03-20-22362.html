<div id="ygrps-yiv-1650207358">Hello :-)<br/>
<br/>
I have heard that University specifically &quot;look for&quot; unschoolers,  <br/>
because they learn better. Do you know more about this? Where can I  <br/>
find something like an advertisement of these Universities? Does  <br/>
anbody know which Universities accept unschoolers?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you<br/>
greetings from Germany<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s more accurate to say unschoolers&#39; applications tend to  <br/>
stand out for certain universities. Places like Harvard University  <br/>
get so many &quot;top&quot; students who&#39;ve gone through the exact same process  <br/>
as each other, won the same top honors, performed the same  <br/>
outstanding service projects that they don&#39;t distinguish themselves.  <br/>
But unschoolers have had unique experiences. Unschoolers who apply  <br/>
have shown a lot of personal drive in the direction of their  <br/>
interests. They haven&#39;t followed the paths laid out by others.  <br/>
They&#39;ve carved unique paths for themselves. They stand out :-)<br/>
<br/>
The lesser colleges and the state colleges who don&#39;t get many  <br/>
unschooling applicants often don&#39;t know what to do with their  <br/>
applications ;-) The colleges are looking for the standard hoops that  <br/>
applicants have jumped through so they can sort the applications into  <br/>
&quot;college material&quot; and &quot;not college material&quot;. So those colleges tend  <br/>
to want to see the same old standard proof that they&#39;re used to.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers can educate them :-) They can help them see the value of  <br/>
a unique life and education. With the top tier universities and  <br/>
colleges, unschoolers don&#39;t have to. It&#39;s already been done for them  <br/>
by unschoolers years and years ago.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something Deb Cunefare posted a bit ago about unschoolers and  <br/>
college. You probably saw it but it&#39;s worth repeating :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Allison McKee&#39;s book &quot;From Homeschool to College and Work&quot; details  <br/>
&gt; how she<br/>
&gt; translated her son&#39;s unschooling experiences into transcripts when  <br/>
&gt; he decided at<br/>
&gt; the last minute to go to college instead of pursuing a career as a  <br/>
&gt; fishing<br/>
&gt; guide at Yellowstone. Guaranteed to help see that teens don&#39;t need  <br/>
&gt; to &quot;pursue<br/>
&gt; academics&quot; to go to college, and helpful for parents trying to pull  <br/>
&gt; together<br/>
&gt; transcripts from an authentic life.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Wes Beach&#39;s book &quot;Opportunities After High School: Thoughts,  <br/>
&gt; Documents,<br/>
&gt; Resources&quot; has sample transcripts written in a wide variety of  <br/>
&gt; styles granting<br/>
&gt; credit for a vast range of real life learning. Some of the  <br/>
&gt; information is specific<br/>
&gt; to CA but most is easily adapted to teens living anywhere. The book is<br/>
&gt; available from the Homeschool Association of California www.hsc.org<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t let the transcript/diploma ride the child. Help him live an  <br/>
&gt; authentic<br/>
&gt; life, in passionate pursuit of his interests, and then if he wants  <br/>
&gt; to go to<br/>
&gt; college help him translate that life into terms the colleges can  <br/>
&gt; understand.<br/>
<br/>
