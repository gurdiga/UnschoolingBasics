<div id="ygrps-yiv-1560762800">Actually, the term ATC (Artist Trading Card) generally<br/>
refers only to the *traded* cards. Art Cards (or<br/>
ACEOs) are what the cards that are sold are usually<br/>
called. They are the same thing but what the artist<br/>
does with them (trades or sells) determines whether<br/>
they are ATCs or Art Cards/ACEOs.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Mostly through on-line groups, though if there is a<br/>
place that holds swaps in your area you can also trade<br/>
in person. If you do a search on Yahoo groups you&#39;ll<br/>
find more than enough groups to get started. Some<br/>
groups are strictly ATC oriented while others do other<br/>
forms of altered and mail arts as well. I trade<br/>
through lots of groups but some of the groups that I<br/>
trade through the most are:<br/>
<br/>
artisttradingcards<br/>
ATC_artists<br/>
miniatureartisttradingcards<br/>
mash_art<br/>
ABAlteredOddArts<br/>
<br/>
The first two are ATC only. The third is miniature<br/>
ATCs only (1 1/2 x 2 1/2 inches). And the last two<br/>
have swaps of other art forms as well as ATCs. (I also<br/>
just joined Imagination Tribe thanks to this list.)<br/>
<br/>
When you are ready to start trading you should<br/>
probably be aware that trades can take different<br/>
forms. One way of trading is through one on one<br/>
trades. It&#39;s the most straighforward in that you<br/>
simply trade the same number of cards with another<br/>
artist, but it&#39;s a little more work to set up a lot of<br/>
personal trades and you build your collection a little<br/>
more slowly this way. One on one trades can be &quot;blind&quot;<br/>
(where you don&#39;t know what cards you are getting, only<br/>
the number), or if the artist has pics of the cards<br/>
they have up for trade online you can request specific<br/>
cards. I think I get some of the best cards this way.<br/>
It&#39;s also an easy way to get started. You can work at<br/>
your own pace and then request a swap with someone<br/>
when you feel ready to trade.  <br/>
<br/>
There are also what are generally referred to as<br/>
partnered swaps. I think these are the easiest kind of<br/>
group swaps for beginners to get involved with because<br/>
someone else sets the theme and the number of cards.<br/>
The host then partners all the participants up kind of<br/>
like one on one trades. All you have to do is make the<br/>
cards and send them to your partner. The number of<br/>
cards is low (usually 1-4) and the return time is<br/>
usually quick since you are only waiting on one<br/>
person. It&#39;s a good way to get your feet wet. The down<br/>
side is the same for one on one trades in that you<br/>
build your collection more slowly. You also don&#39;t get<br/>
as much variety from partnered swaps since you are<br/>
only receiving from one person per swap. In my<br/>
experience with ATCs I have found that the quality of<br/>
the cards in partnered swaps is not always as good as<br/>
the ones from one on one swaps though. I attribute<br/>
that to the fact that the deadlines are usually short<br/>
so many people tend to rush to create their cards by<br/>
the deadline.<br/>
<br/>
Then there are the larger hosted swaps. The number of<br/>
cards you need to create for larger swaps is usually<br/>
higher, though not always, and you often have to wait<br/>
a lot longer to get your cards back because you have<br/>
to wait for everyone who signed up for the swap to get<br/>
their cards in so they can be swapped out with<br/>
everyone else. If there are international players it<br/>
can take quite a while (a month or more) for you to<br/>
receive the cards from hosted swaps. It&#39;s usually<br/>
worth the wait and you get a good variety this way,<br/>
but creating the large number of cards that are<br/>
sometimes needed for hosted swaps can be stressful for<br/>
beginners. If you start with hosted swaps (which are<br/>
the most common form of swaps on lists) I&#39;d suggest<br/>
starting with ones that have a relatively low card<br/>
requirement. <br/>
<br/>
In some swaps if the requirement is low - say 3 cards<br/>
- you can send in multiples of that number to receive<br/>
more cards in return. For instance I just received<br/>
cards from a swap that had a minimum requirement of 3<br/>
cards but we could send in 3, 6 or 9. I like 9 card<br/>
swaps because they fill one page of a trading card<br/>
page, so I made 9 cards and got 9 back. Doing this<br/>
kind of swap is a good way to work your way into<br/>
larger swaps. You can start with the lowest number and<br/>
work your way up as you feel more confident.<br/>
<br/>
Whew, sorry! That ended up being a lot longer than I<br/>
meant for it to be! I get a little long winded when it<br/>
comes to my obsessions!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-333226811">What kind of art does it have to be? My son is five and a half and he wants<br/>
to do it. He loves cards and heard me talking about it with my husband. He<br/>
draws, paints and does free art on the &#39;puter. Are there guidelines to<br/>
making the cards? Does anyone swap at MHEA conference? Is it a kid thing<br/>
only?<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry to ask all these questions if you already covered this but I<br/>
didn&#39;t read most of them because the first few I thought it was a local<br/>
thing and figured I wasn&#39;t local enough.<br/>
