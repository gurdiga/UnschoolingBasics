  <div>I plan on homeschooling my 7 year old and am very interested 
  in&nbsp;unschooling. It is looking like I might try a combination of Waldorf, 
  unschooling and a bit of classic homeschooling with a big emphasis on 
  unschooling.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</div></font></blockquote></span></blockquote></div>

<div>Hi, Susan! What you&#39;ll find on *this* list is really *just* unschooling. 
We&#39;re not really sure how one could combine Unschooling with Waldorf and Classic 
Homeschooling. Unschooling is about trusting the child to learn what she needs 
when she needs it. Waldorf and &quot;school-at-home&quot; will work against that 
philosophy. </div>

  <div>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;My 7 year old has some special needs (Aspergers) so 
  thruthfully I am not sure what is going to work with her and what 
  isn&#39;t.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</div></font></blockquote>

<div>You might want to log on to <a rel="nofollow" title="http://www.unschooling.com/"
 target="_blank" href="http://www.unschooling.com/">www.unschooling.com</a> and read the message 
boards. One of the esteemed regular posters there is Anne Ohman (AnneO). Anne 
has a child with Aspergers and posts regulary about his unique qualities---he&#39;s 
what brought her to unschooling. I have spent four weekends over the last two 
years&nbsp;with Jacob, and he&#39;s absolutely delightful. I&#39;m sure that, if Anne 
had imposed all the rules and regulations and----especially school on 
Jacob,&nbsp;he would have been crushed. Instead, she and Dave have honored him 
(and his brother Sam) for Who He Is (as she puts it). </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Anne is a gentle soul who believes that children can and will Shine if 
allowed to be Who They Are. LOTS of worthy reading there. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I&#39;d keep an eye out for Mary (Life is Good) &quot;Zenmomma&quot; Gold. She also has 
some great advice for moms of special needs kids.</div>
