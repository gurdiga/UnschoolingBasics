<div id="ygrps-yiv-1783468839">Mel, I just checked unschooling.com and the article I referred to was <br/>
actually written by a dad, not a mom.  Sorry dad ;)  There is also <br/>
another great essay entitled, &quot;How My Children Learned to Read,&quot; by Pam <br/>
S.  (list member here and very experienced unschooling mom :)  <br/>
<br/>
Sharon</div>
</article>
