<div id="ygrps-yiv-1605353321">I am having a hard time parenting my 12 (soon to be 13 y/o) dd. She has<br/>
always been unschooled and we live in a family that respects the needs and<br/>
wants of everyone.<br/>
<br/>
It seems that no matter what I say or do she sees it as controlling her. I<br/>
try to be gentle and respectful and she talks and acts like I am punishing<br/>
her. If I say anything about my feelings, concerns, etc she shuts down. She<br/>
refuses to acknowledge anything that isn&#39;t about her. It feels like she has<br/>
become tyrannical and controls the family. Its like she has decided that she<br/>
can&#39;t be uncomfortable or unhappy without it being someones fault, usually<br/>
me or her younger brother.<br/>
<br/>
Today I asked her if she wanted to buy some socks. She had said that she<br/>
needed some. We had money. She said, &quot;Cant&#39; we go another day?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I said, &quot;Well It&#39;s Friday so this weekend with be mobbed.&quot; (the stores are<br/>
getting crowded with holiday shoppers already and I have a panic disorder).<br/>
Also she has recently started school at her request, so during the week she<br/>
is too tired to do anything more than school. Today was a day off.<br/>
<br/>
So we came up with the solution that she would go for a walk and then have a<br/>
bit to space out and play video games. Then we would go get socks. The time<br/>
came to go get socks. I asked if she was ready. She whined a bit. I asked<br/>
her did she want to go or not. We could table it for sometime next week. No<br/>
she needed socks (I can&#39;t pick them out) and she needed to get them. So she<br/>
went but with a begrudging attitude. I centered myself and got ready.<br/>
<br/>
In the car we were chatting about things. Her brother wants to try school<br/>
because she likes it so much. It was nice. I am not sure how it came to it<br/>
but we were talking about how she is really ready to live her own live but<br/>
that society doesn&#39;t work that way and its frustrating for her. I asked her<br/>
what I could do to help make her life more her own. To help her get<br/>
experiences that she wanted even in this society. She shut down. I didn&#39;t<br/>
know why and I asked her what was up. She got really grumpy and pissy. When<br/>
I asked her what was up she told me that I was complaining about her and<br/>
telling her what is wrong with her. I tried to explain that I wasn&#39;t, and<br/>
reiterated what I was saying. She just got more distance and angry.<br/>
<br/>
She told me that she didn&#39;t even want to go shopping and wanted me to just<br/>
stopped talking. SO I didn&#39;t shut up and started getting really panicky and<br/>
frustrated. I pulled it together and centered myself. So we went home. No<br/>
socks. On the way home she told me that she wished I would be a different<br/>
parent and why couldn&#39;t I just punish her and not talk. It is really<br/>
frustrating because she says this alot.<br/>
<br/>
Like if she does something I don&#39;t like (like leave the house without<br/>
telling me and I have no idea where she is, I feel scared) I will talk to<br/>
her about it. I want to figure out how it wont happen again. She just wants<br/>
me to ground her and it be over.<br/>
<br/>
So that&#39;s where we are right now. She is &quot;grounded&quot;. She is in her room<br/>
cleaning it. She has to come home from school and straight home each night<br/>
for a week. She said she prefeers this to &quot;Talking&quot;. I feel manipulated. I<br/>
have never punished any of my kids! And I don&#39;t want to but feel like I have<br/>
run out of options with her.<br/>
<br/>
A) she didn&#39;t want to go shopping and &quot;kicked and screamed&quot; til we didn&#39;t go<br/>
B) she didn&#39;t want to take responsibility for her actions so she refused to<br/>
talk<br/>
C) she wanted to explore being grounded so she set up a scenario to be<br/>
grounded.<br/>
<br/>
I just feel like she could have said that she didn&#39;t really want to go and<br/>
work out an alternative time. I feel like she could have respectfully ask to<br/>
table the conversation if she was too tired or whatever. I feel like if she<br/>
wanted the experience of anything she could get it without manipulation.<br/>
<br/>
I am just feeling at wits end with her. She has become more and more selfish<br/>
and controlling.<br/>
<br/>
Please help with a perspective change and any useful suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
Faith<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-363125012">A) she didn&#39;t want to go shopping and &quot;kicked and screamed&quot; til we didn&#39;t go&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
why did she have to kick and scream to not go?  i don&#39;t mean to be trite, but i find with my adolescent and preadolsecent, when i &quot;make&quot; them push and cry and scream and basically explode to get their needs heard/met, it never really works out too well...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
B) she didn&#39;t want to take responsibility for her actions so she refused to<br/>
talk&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
why was it required that she take responsibility for her actions to talk with you?  i have learned to back wAAAAAY off of requiring conversations to go in any specific direction, if i want my kids to continue to come to me and talk to me when they are struggling, or really with anything.    it sounds to me like she is showing you in several ways that  she IS ready for something new and different in her life/relationship with you, and i know you asked her how you could help, but i don&#39;t know that she will necessarily have that kind of clarity.   i find my teen daughter to be both responsible, mature, introspective, capable, etc., AND extremely sensitive, tender, vulnerable, and prone to perceiving any subtle hint of concern or stress as intense criticism.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
C) she wanted to explore being grounded so she set up a scenario to be<br/>
grounded.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i don&#39;t quite understand this either - it sounds like a polemic situation that didn&#39;t need to be polemic. i would NOT ground my kids even if they asked me to. but i also wouldn&#39;t require them to talk to me. - i don&#39;t see it as either/or.  maybe if you think about it a different way - what if she had said - &quot;i&#39;d rather you spank me than make me talk&quot; - would you have done it?  i doubt it! :)  maybe i am misunderstanding the grounding thing...<br/>
<br/>
what has really helped the communication with my daughter is me backing way way off whenever there is any hint of her putting up a wall.  and then, after a little space - reaching out with NO reference to the previous wall. finding ways to connect, to relax, to enjoy each other&#39;s company.  and one of the ways in which she&#39;s shown her need for &quot;something new&quot; in terms of her own control over her life, etc., is to come to ME if she needs my help with  plans, as opposed to me trying to organize it for her.  so, if she  needed socks, and i knew she wanted to pick them out, i&#39;d way til she asked me to set up a time to go get them, rather than pushing or encouraging her to do something on  a schedule that seh clearly wasn&#39;t happy with.<br/>
<br/>
i am not clear what part of the discussion about her need for more freedom and  independence your daughter was perceiving as criticism - do you have clarity on that?<br/>
<br/>
also have you read &quot;parent-teen breakthrough: the relationship approach&quot;?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1990748136">First of all she is at the age when everyone is wrong and she is always right I know this because my daughter is almost 13.I think she is wanting attention and your nice so she knows she can do what she wants maybe be a little more stern with her and she might be OK with the grounding right now but she will get tired of it and hopefully think about how she is treating you I take the computer from my daughter when she is grounded and she hates it or even no TV.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1863548210">MJ (now 17) and I went through a stretch where she was resenting me a lot. I think she was 13 or 14. I reacted by, well, freaking out because I had a lot of fear about parent-teen relationship.

<br/>
I backed completely off and started waiting for her to come to me. I started being really aware and somewhat cautious of when I touched or hugged her. I let her initiate more (or not). When she talked, I tried to listen and enjoy without offering opinions.<br/>

That last might have been key, actually. She was taking a huge step forward into independence, and she wanted to try things her way for a while, without my two cents&#39; worth. It was a reasonable thing to want!<br/>

As soon as I removed my energy (not my love) from the equation, it got a lot less dramatic. Things settled down almost immediately and improved by leaps over the next couple months.<br/>
<br/>
In your case, Faith, it sounds like you&#39;re somewhat invested in the *talking* part of it. Well, you can&#39;t force her to talk any more than you can force her to learn! She *will* talk to you, and you *will* have opportunities to share your opinions and hopes, etc., and you *will* continue to have moments of amazing connection and communication. But it&#39;s going to happen more and more on her schedule, at her whim even--some of my deepest, warmest conversations with MJ now come out of the blue, just &#39;cause she&#39;s in the mood to talk. And if there are situations that come up that I want to discuss, the discussion is always made better by delaying it.<br/>
<br/>
I really appreciate the sentiments behind this: &quot;I asked her what I could do to help make her life more her own. To help her get experiences that she wanted even in this society.&quot; Just keep in mind that you can *offer* help without asking a question. In some ways, asking the &quot;How can I help?&quot; question assumes that of course there&#39;s something you can do and that of course your daughter will want that help. Instead, you can say, &quot;Let me know if I can help.&quot; It&#39;s supportive without being intrusive.<br/>

<br/>
  yes!  ronnie, i am so glad you said this - i meant to also say that i went throught this with my daughter too, and responded similarly, and it was really painful!<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  yes, and i felt very concerned that this need for independence somehow made me not a good unschooling mother - because she wanted more distance and privacy for a while.  i had ingrained in my mind, some notion or image of a perfectly attached, connected, happy, blissful mother-daugther relationship complete with total trust and best-friendiness.  NOT a helpfiul ideal to hold myself up against! :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-443717807">Thanks for this thread Faith.  I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re having such a difficult time<br/>
right now, but I so appreciate hearing ideas before I get there.  Lola, who<br/>
will be 9 on Monday, already needs space sometimes and I SO want to fix<br/>
everything!!!  It&#39;s almost a physical pain that I have that I can&#39;t fix<br/>
things (and listening to her cry and there&#39;s nothing I can do to make it<br/>
better rips my heart out!).  She&#39;s been like this all her life and I am<br/>
slowly learning to do what everyone&#39;s said and lovingly say, &quot;I&#39;m here if<br/>
you need me&quot; or &quot;Let me know if I can help in any way&quot;.  I&#39;m hoping I&#39;ll<br/>
have it down in the next 3 or so years (and then there&#39;s Eva, 6 who is even<br/>
MORE sensitive, in a totally different way).  I have a huge fear of the teen<br/>
years!  I&#39;m just trying to breathe deep and figure out a way to ride the<br/>
wave.<br/>
Thanks all for the thoughts!  Faith, I look forward to hearing what you find<br/>
that works.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-622381161">I tend to talk too much. I talk all the time. On a long car trip my grandmother would pay me a quarter for 15 minutes of silence. Those were hard 15 minutes and quickly quarters became not worth it. My talking is a non-issue when things are good. But when things are bad, my desire to discuss, at great length, whatever is going on is not helpful. It doesn&#39;t change anything. It doesn&#39;t improve anything. It just adds words to hurting and sensitive ears who hear me as being critical or harsh. I don&#39;t want to do that. So I&#39;ve learned to be quieter. I&#39;ve learned that not everything needs to be discussed. <br/>
 <br/>
About the socks. If it were me and Linnaea wanted to go get socks I&#39;d offer to take her. If she was too busy in that moment to go I&#39;d say I can take you but we have to go by whenever or we&#39;ll have to do it another day. And that would be it. My offering is a gift. What she does with that gift is her deal. If she came to me too late to get them I wouldn&#39;t be snippy or grouchy, I&#39;d be honestly sympathetic and talk about going on Saturday (even with the crowds) or ordering them on-line or knitting a pair or whatever. <br/>
 <br/>
About the grounding. I wouldn&#39;t do that. I&#39;d go upstairs and say I don&#39;t want to ground you. I don&#39;t want to have grounding be part of my parenting toolbox. I&#39;d free her and offer to go get socks now or whenever was good for the both of us and I&#39;d let it go. <br/>
 <br/>
Talk less and listen more. Don&#39;t worry about something not happening again. It&#39;ll happen again even if you can verbally peg down why it happened. Things happen. Lightening strikes the same place many times. Be willing to bend and not break or snap back. <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s hard to have things not be controllable, but people are often not controllable. <br/>

Young people are frequently surrounded by adults who refuse to listen, who contradict themselves endlessly, and who fail to practice what they preach. Its no wonder most teens think little of adults - they finally have the tools to see the hypocricy of the world and it infuriates them. Its one of the things that makes people in their teens so wonderful. <br/>

<br/>
It doesn&#39;t sound to me like the girl in question wants attention, though. She&#39;s saying, very very clearly, from my perspective, that she needs more space. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
How does generating more hate in your home create a loving and supportive environment? Kids don&#39;t need reasons to hate, especially teens. They need reasons to love, to feel safe and supported. Its an overwhelming time in a person&#39;s life! Its challenging to support people in this time of life! Please don&#39;t add any more hate to your child&#39;s world. Listen to her and treat her as gently as you possibly can. <br/>

<br/>
The very idea that you have feelings is probably enough to make her feel overwhelmed - OMG, I have to deal with YOUR feelings TOO? Blaaaaaahhhhhhhh! <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s incredibly needy right now, but part of the problem is she doesn&#39;t know what she needs. She has entirely new sensations moving through her body and mind, and that&#39;s baffling. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It might help you to catch yourself when you see her as &quot;shutting down&quot;. She&#39;s developing more internal skills, and dealing with big new feelings, so turning her attention inward may be a really important activity for her. She needs time and space to process, and she may not be able to do that while talking - I can&#39;t process while talking or while someone else is talking! I have to go away and think and then come back to something.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I asked her what was up she told me that I was complaining about her and<br/>
&gt; telling her what is wrong with her. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Instead of arguing, try to hear the feelings behind the words. She took your comment critically. That&#39;s not about you, its about her, her uncertain emotions right now, but its something you can respond to by being more careful of your words. Wait more before saying or asking Anything, even for clarification. Assume there&#39;s a whole Pile of processing going on while you wait, and that&#39;s all about her right now. Its not something you can, necessarily help with.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;On the way home she told me that she wished I would be a different<br/>
&gt; parent and why couldn&#39;t I just punish her and not talk. It is really<br/>
&gt; frustrating because she says this alot.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Personally, when someone is trying to talk, to get me to talk, and I want to think about something I feel like I&#39;m drowing in a sea of words! I get so overwhelmed I can&#39;t hear what the other person is saying. Being required to isolate myself would seem like sheer heaven in that kind of situation. <br/>
<br/>
If that&#39;s true of your dd, then No Wonder she&#39;s saying she&#39;d rather be punished! She&#39;s lost the moment you start trying to help! Poor kid! Poor helpful mom! You&#39;re using the wrong strategy. Its NOT you, or her, its that you&#39;re using a communicaiton style that&#39;s utterly ineffective under these circumstances. The good news is that you can change that. You can learn to talk less and listen more, to give your dd the space she needs to think. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I just feel like she could have said...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She had conflicting urges, was feeling overwhelmed. In that kind of situation, I often can&#39;t &quot;just&quot; say anything. Saying anything is an enormous effort involving finding words to fit feelings and Then finding words that aren&#39;t &quot;Leave me the F*** alone (but not too alone, can you maybe just hide outside the door and cough occasionally so I know you still love me?)!!!!&quot; Even with two decades more practice than your dd has, I still usually get stuck trying to find the nicer, more coherent, less whiney, way of expressing that, and tend to shut down. Happily, I have a partner who understands all this and knows what &quot;Grrr... not now&quot; really means!<br/>
<br/>
So step back, please, and see that her process is very very different from yours right now. Talking is the last thing she can do. <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a thought - she likes to write? Can you start a project of writing back and forth to each other? It doesn&#39;t matter what, I don&#39;t think, at first, just see it as a way to start another kind of dialog, one where she has alllll the time and space she needs to clarify her own thoughts. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-493424216">Meredith said, &quot;This is terribly dismissive of teens. Young people are frequently surrounded by adults who refuse to listen, who contradict themselves endlessly, and who fail to practice what they preach. Its no wonder most teens think little of adults - they finally have the tools to see the hypocricy of the world and it infuriates them. It&#39;s one of the things that makes people in their teens so wonderful.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for this post, Meredith!  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m working hard to be a mom that will listen to my kids and practice what I &quot;preach&quot;, but I fail constantly!  Thankfully, my kids feel safe enough to point out my hypocricy. I have really been faced with these truths over the last couple of months, so seeing it written in words that make complete sense is VERY helpful.  <br/>
<br/>
Of course it PISSES them off to be surrounded by adults that do all of those things you listed!  I believe I&#39;m doing a much better job than most mainstream parents, but I have MUCH room for improvement.  I&#39;m really realizing how often I do these things!  I&#39;m finding myself wanting to take things away in an attempt to control their behavior, but I KNOW that if I would treat them in a way that tells them that they are loved, important, and treasured then they won&#39;t want/need to act in a way that is so negative and/or &quot;nasty&quot;!  It&#39;s up to ME to make a change in me.<br/>
<br/>
Meredith said, &quot;How does generating more hate in your home create a loving and supportive environment? Kids don&#39;t need reasons to hate, especially teens. They need reasons to love, to feel safe and supported. Its an overwhelming time in a person&#39;s life! Its challenging to support people in this time of life! Please don&#39;t add any more hate to your child&#39;s world. Listen to her and treat her as gently as you possibly can.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m surrounded by friends that use control and punishments with their kids, and they encourage me to use punishments and control...which I don&#39;t.  They view me as &quot;weak&quot; because I want to treat my kids with respect.  I know I am still responsible for guiding my kids (and I do), but I can do that in a way that is loving, supportive, and uplifting...not reactionary and with force or control.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thank you for you insight and the simple way in which you worded it!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-802382332">My eldest is 13.  We made it through her 12th year because I learned a few things quickly:<br/>
When she wanted space she got space, as much as she needed.  She wasn&#39;t rejecting me and it wasn&#39;t about me (and trust that just because they need space now, they won&#39;t always be shutting the door in your face.  Now my daughter wants lots and lots of hugs, but only when she asks for them.)<br/>
 <br/>
She needs to talk and I need to listen (we both process verbally so that was a challenge for me.)  <br/>
 <br/>
I need to always be on her side, supporting her, loving her, buying her the eye-liner or curling iron or taking her to the mall even though the mall makes me crazy (and I need to figure out what I can do to make it a fun trip..  We usually go for no more that 1 1/2 hours and we get something small to eat or drink while we are there.  Try going right as they open or the last 1/2 hour before they close, too.)  <br/>
 <br/>
When I screw up I admit it and try again, or at least apologize.<br/>
 <br/>
We walk the dog together every night, just the two of us.  She talks, I listen.  It&#39;s done wonders for our relationship.  Doing something together can trigger conversation.<br/>
 <br/>
With my middle daughter (age 10) we&#39;ve found that writing back and forth helps.  Talking triggers emotions for both of us and it usually isn&#39;t constructive.  If she&#39;s upset about something she writes it down and hands it to me or leaves it on my pillow.  We can even sit on the bed and pass notes back and forth, it works wonders!<br/>
 <br/>
Part of helping is giving them the space they need to figure out what it is they need :).<br/>

I used to ask my husband, &quot;What can I do to help?&quot; and it would make him soooo mad. He finally told me that he hated that question and would prefer if I asked, &quot;Would you like a cup of tea?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I get it now. I was trying to be helpful and supportive, but sometimes it&#39;s not so helpful to ask a person what they need -- to make them think about it or make them ask for something -- especially if they may be feeling unsure or conflicted about their feelings. But offering to do something nice for them (tea or foot rub or whatever) *shows* the love and support and opens up that space for talking (or not) when they&#39;re ready.<br/>
<br/>
Now, hopefully I&#39;ll remember this when my kids are teenagers!<br/>

&gt; privacy for a while. i had ingrained in my mind, some notion or image of a<br/>
&gt; perfectly attached, connected, happy, blissful mother-daugther relationship<br/>
&gt; complete with total trust and best-friendiness. NOT a helpfiul ideal to hold<br/>
&gt; myself up against! :)<br/>

 These are some of the parenting messages I have in my head that I am<br/>
working to silence. I prefer having a more generous and loving vision of who<br/>
my child it. Granted this was a time that I fail to hold that vision, I<br/>
still see her as a respectful and wonderful human.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;I asked her<br/>
&gt; &gt; what I could do to help make her life more her own. To help her get<br/>
&gt; &gt; experiences that she wanted even in this society. She shut down. I didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; know why and I asked her what was up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It might help you to catch yourself when you see her as &quot;shutting down&quot;.<br/>
&gt; She&#39;s developing more internal skills, and dealing with big new feelings, so<br/>
&gt; turning her attention inward may be a really important activity for her. She<br/>
&gt; needs time and space to process, and she may not be able to do that while<br/>
&gt; talking - I can&#39;t process while talking or while someone else is talking! I<br/>
&gt; have to go away and think and then come back to something.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I asked her what was up she told me that I was complaining about her and<br/>
&gt; &gt; telling her what is wrong with her.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Instead of arguing, try to hear the feelings behind the words. She took<br/>
&gt; your comment critically. That&#39;s not about you, its about her, her uncertain<br/>
&gt; emotions right now, but its something you can respond to by being more<br/>
&gt; careful of your words. Wait more before saying or asking Anything, even for<br/>
&gt; clarification. Assume there&#39;s a whole Pile of processing going on while you<br/>
&gt; wait, and that&#39;s all about her right now. Its not something you can,<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;On the way home she told me that she wished I would be a different<br/>

&gt; &gt; frustrating because she says this alot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Personally, when someone is trying to talk, to get me to talk, and I want<br/>
&gt; to think about something I feel like I&#39;m drowing in a sea of words! I get so<br/>
&gt; overwhelmed I can&#39;t hear what the other person is saying. Being required to<br/>
&gt; isolate myself would seem like sheer heaven in that kind of situation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If that&#39;s true of your dd, then No Wonder she&#39;s saying she&#39;d rather be<br/>
&gt; punished! She&#39;s lost the moment you start trying to help! Poor kid! Poor<br/>
&gt; helpful mom! You&#39;re using the wrong strategy. Its NOT you, or her, its that<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re using a communicaiton style that&#39;s utterly ineffective under these<br/>

&gt; talk less and listen more, to give your dd the space she needs to think.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I just feel like she could have said...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; She had conflicting urges, was feeling overwhelmed. In that kind of<br/>
&gt; situation, I often can&#39;t &quot;just&quot; say anything. Saying anything is an enormous<br/>
&gt; effort involving finding words to fit feelings and Then finding words that<br/>
&gt; aren&#39;t &quot;Leave me the F*** alone (but not too alone, can you maybe just hide<br/>
&gt; outside the door and cough occasionally so I know you still love me?)!!!!&quot;<br/>
&gt; Even with two decades more practice than your dd has, I still usually get<br/>
&gt; stuck trying to find the nicer, more coherent, less whiney, way of<br/>
&gt; expressing that, and tend to shut down. Happily, I have a partner who<br/>
&gt; understands all this and knows what &quot;Grrr... not now&quot; really means!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So step back, please, and see that her process is very very different from<br/>
&gt; yours right now. Talking is the last thing she can do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s a thought - she likes to write? Can you start a project of writing<br/>
&gt; back and forth to each other? It doesn&#39;t matter what, I don&#39;t think, at<br/>
&gt; first, just see it as a way to start another kind of dialog, one where she<br/>
&gt; has alllll the time and space she needs to clarify her own thoughts.<br/>
