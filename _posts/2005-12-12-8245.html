<div id="ygrps-yiv-742083854">&quot;Yet I grieve over the thought of<br/>
sending him &quot;out&quot; to school when the others stay home, over the<br/>
possibility of him losing the closeness with his siblings, being less<br/>
a part of what goes on here.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Listen to that voice that grieves, it is truth.<br/>
Your heart knows what is right, what I hear is other voices <br/>
influencing what YOU know is right. Your reasons for sending him to <br/>
school center around being accepted, but when does school ever help <br/>
someone feel MORE or better when they&#39;re already different?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have a Down Syndrome child, but I have cared for Down&#39;s <br/>
babies and toddlers in the past, worked with an adult Down&#39;s young <br/>
adult and volunteered many times with children of various mental <br/>
disabilities.<br/>
<br/>
What I saw in the Down Syndrome child I babysat regularly, was a <br/>
sweet, happy, lovely little girl that was surrounded by love....then <br/>
went to school and wasn&#39;t as happy. <br/>
<br/>
If school is not the answer for your other children, why would it <br/>
somehow help a young person that has bigger challenges? Why would <br/>
strangers know how to help her better than you? What is all this <br/>
therapy that has you convinced you need experts to continue, rather <br/>
than stimulating this child yourself?<br/>
<br/>
I realize Down&#39;s syndrome kids can be hugely challenging in <br/>
different ways. They are delayed in many areas, but that&#39;s WHO they <br/>
ARE. And we can honor who they are, right now today, by trusting in <br/>
natural learning...even for the child that has disabilities.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m no expert on Down&#39;s, but everything I&#39;ve ever seen makes me <br/>
believe that they are  MUCH better off at home, with people that <br/>
love them and surrounded by the kind of environment that allows them <br/>
to simply be who they are. If there is some kind of stimulation that <br/>
child needs, I believe with all my heart it can be found outside of <br/>
school.<br/>
