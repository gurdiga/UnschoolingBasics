<div id="ygrps-yiv-560587101">Dear listmembers,<br/>
<br/>
This is a feeler to see about a gathering that will take place this<br/>
month for unschoolers and those interested in learning about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It will be a small informal gathering that will include a potluck,<br/>
drum circle, some round table discussions and possibly a teen panel.<br/>
Very loosely structured, mainly with the idea of getting together with<br/>
those in the Eastern TN and Western NC area (anyone welcome though).<br/>
<br/>
Eli Gerzon will be coming down from Boston to share his experiences<br/>
about world travel and leaving school in high school.<br/>
<br/>
Steve Cooperman is an unschooling and sustainability advocate that<br/>
will be helping us organize this.<br/>
<br/>
If you, or anyone you know would like to be a part of this event,<br/>
please  email me right away with your preference of dates. It will<br/>
happen either the weekend of the 17th and 18th or over Thanksgiving<br/>
weekend the 24th and 25th.<br/>
<br/>
We will have something organized this weekend so please give your<br/>
feedback now.  We&#39;d love to have folks come and share something they<br/>
are passionate about...either with an informal funshop (think like<br/>
you&#39;re hanging out with friends and showing them something you enjoy<br/>
doing) or by participating in a discussion.<br/>
<br/>
YOu can also email topics you&#39;d love to see covered at this gathering,<br/>
so we can be sure to have someone facilitate that round table.<br/>
<br/>
The idea is to bring unschoolers in the region together for FUN and<br/>
with the idea that this may become a yearly gathering. <br/>
<br/>
Please write me offlist if you&#39;re interested in participating.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!!<br/>
