Until you see what they do as exactly ENOUGH, they are going to feel<br/>

It&#39;s not &quot;only&quot; video games. It&#39;s VIDEO GAMES, one of the BEST ways to<br/>
learn!!!:)<br/>
Don&#39;t diminish what they love with all the judgements. Every bit of<br/>
pushing or prodding you&#39;ve done, has UNDONE all the unschooling. They<br/>
can&#39;t possibly trust that they really have freedom.<br/>
Until there is trust, unschooling just won&#39;t unfold joyfully.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2143809956">I feel the GED is important because you need a diploma or ged to get <br/>
financial aid for college in my state.<br/>
<br/>
My 14 year old wants to get a loan for his own ice cream truck and <br/>
work for himself when he turns 18. If that goal doesn&#39;t change, then <br/>
I guess he won&#39;t need a ged, but the other two will. He is starting <br/>
his own ebay business in the meantime until he is old enough to get <br/>
a loan. I guess he will learn enough from that project to acheive <br/>
his goal. <br/>
<br/>
But the other two may want to go to college, and he may change his <br/>
mind by then. How would they get financial aid without the GED? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I realize that you can learn alot from video games- but there has <br/>
got to be more. There aren&#39;t many jobs it prepares you for.<br/>
<br/>
The kids in your article were getting a diploma. I don&#39;t have a <br/>
school like that around here that will give a diploma for that kind <br/>
of education.<br/>
<br/>
What do your kids do all day? What do you think they are learning <br/>
from it? (everyone)<br/>

them out?  No;  you use math in everyday context.  You balance your<br/>
checkbook (or not) you measure food (or not), you weigh yourself (or<br/>
not), you judge distance to know when to turn your signal on when<br/>
driving (or not), you count knitting stitches or cross stitch stitches<br/>
(or not), you figure out if you have enough pocket change for the toll<br/>
(or not)  See, you can choose to do math, so also should your<br/>
children. They&#39;ll learn it when they need it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Safe enough or are you too frightened to attempt them?  What if you<br/>
challenged yourself to find a way to make them safe?  What would it<br/>
take to do one of those projects?  Is it that they aren&#39;t safe enough<br/>
or that you don&#39;t want to expend the energy to find a way to keep him<br/>
safe while he explores this avenue of adventure?    I&#39;m not saying<br/>
that to berate your or belittle you.  I&#39;m saying it because someone<br/>
said it to me and it opened up my whole mind to being creative.  Mine<br/>
wasn&#39;t anarchy (although I do have a child who wants to take over the<br/>
world) but it was art.  I hated the kids doing art because it was so<br/>
messy!  I was hindering them from doing something that they were<br/>
yearning to do because *I* didn&#39;t want to clean up after them.  I&#39;ve<br/>
had to stop myself from doing the same when they&#39;ve wanted to cook or<br/>
do a science experiment that they&#39;ve read about.  Instead of &quot;It&#39;s too<br/>
dangerous&quot; think, &quot;How can I make this happen for him?&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do they need a GED?  Most likely not.  Many colleges are not requiring<br/>
diplomas nor GED&#39;s from homeschooled kids.  And they *are* learning.<br/>
It just doesn&#39;t look like what learning looks like in school!  Just<br/>
because it isn&#39;t math worksheets and term papers doesn&#39;t mean that<br/>
they aren&#39;t learning!<br/>

&gt;before too long.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One reason they may be reluctant to venture away <br/>
from the things they love doing to the exclusion <br/>
of anything else is that they may be anticipating <br/>
the return to being made to do stuff.  They may <br/>
be waiting for you to chicken out once again and <br/>
put an end to their freedom of choice.  But, you <br/>
said yourself that they are happiest when <br/>
unschooling, and happiness can be the most educational thing of all!<br/>
<br/>
Having said all that, what would do you think it <br/>
would look like for them to &quot;choose to do <br/>
anything educational&quot;?  Are you expecting them to <br/>
walk over to the bookshelf and grab a physics <br/>
textbook?  Or a spelling workbook?  Why on earth would they do that?<br/>
<br/>
If you could relax a little with this thing, you <br/>
could begin to see how all the things they need <br/>
to learn are contained in the passions they <br/>
gravitate to (pardon the dangling <br/>
preposition!).  My 11¬Ω-year-old son loves to play <br/>
Yu-Gi-Oh, he loves to play World of Warcraft, and <br/>
he loves to play various video games.  There are <br/>
a few TV shows he likes to watch.  None of this <br/>
stuff would look educational to most folks, but <br/>
he learns from everything he does!  He is <br/>
learning to read, to write, to spell, to <br/>
calculate, to understand time, and to solve <br/>
problems.  He is learning to research and wants <br/>
to design his own video games.  He&#39;s not an avid <br/>
book reader; he&#39;s just not interested.  But, as <br/>
we drive down the road he loves to try to read <br/>
just about every sign he can, and we talk about <br/>
it all.  He loves to buy new Yu-Gi-Oh cards, and <br/>
he has to figure out how he&#39;ll afford to buy what <br/>
he wants.  He budgets for this.  He does amazing <br/>
calculations in his head to keep score during YGO <br/>
duels!  He astounds me!!  He has to write <br/>
messages to his co-players on WoW on the fly.  He <br/>
has to read prompts and other information on <br/>
video games.  He has to navigate around a large <br/>
map on WoW.  I would be honored and delighted to <br/>
help him, if he asks, but he rarely, if ever, does!<br/>
<br/>
A year ago, he was not reading or writing at <br/>
all.  I had no idea about the kinds of <br/>
calculations he was able to do because I don&#39;t <br/>
test him (of course), but he has an amazing mind for calculation.<br/>
<br/>
If he ever needs to, I have no doubt he will be <br/>
able to pass any basic skills test without <br/>
breaking a sweat.  He has never chosen anything <br/>
&quot;educational,&quot; and yet he seems quite <br/>
educated!  And, he&#39;s really nice and wonderful to <br/>
be with and we NEVER lock horns about what he&#39;s <br/>
doing.  He feels honored and respected, and he <br/>
respects me, too.  All of this, I believe, stems <br/>
from his choices being honored.<br/>
<br/>
Try to see what the educational perks are of the <br/>
things your kids love to do.  Try to see how <br/>
they&#39;re absorbing the information they need from <br/>
what they love to do.  Most of all, try to resist <br/>
the urge to disturb their process; let them be <br/>
and they will be free to chose more and more <br/>
things, and you will be amazed at how &quot;educational&quot; their choices really are!<br/>

to qualify for financial aid here:<br/>

<br/>
I specifically point out this:<br/>
Demonstrate by one of the following means that you are qualified to<br/>
enroll in postsecondary education:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Have a high school diploma or a General Education Development (GED)<br/>
Certificate.<br/>
*Pass an approved ability-to-benefit (ATB) test.<br/>
*Meet other standards your state establishes that we have approved.<br/>
***********Complete a high school education in a home school setting<br/>
approved under state law.<br/>
<br/>
If you are doing such then your children qualify!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But the other two may want to go to college, and he may change his<br/>
&gt; mind by then. How would they get financial aid without the GED?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the key word in that first sentence is MAY.  They MAY want to go.<br/>
They are so young right now.  They may decide later that they do<br/>
indeed want to go to college and *then* they can work on the<br/>
requirements needed to attend college.  And college doesn&#39;t have to<br/>
start at 18.  Very few 18 yo&#39;s really know what they want to do &quot;when<br/>
they grow up.&quot;  I think more unschooled kids do as they&#39;ve had the<br/>
ability and joy of pursuing their interests.<br/>

&gt; got to be more. There aren&#39;t many jobs it prepares you for.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Think of all that they *are* learning.  They are learning all kinds of<br/>
life skills from playing video games.  They are learning to make use<br/>
of their resources, keep track of those resources, solve puzzles,<br/>
answer riddles, increasing reflexes, learning maps and keeping track<br/>
of changes in those maps, learning about art, using money wisely a<br/>
whole slew of things.  BTW, those are things that my 13 yo just listed<br/>
off to me of things she thinks she has learned from playing Kingdom<br/>
Hearts II ceaslessly for the past 2 days.  :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What do your kids do all day? What do you think they are learning<br/>
&gt; from it? (everyone)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I keep meaning to answer this from a previous post, so I&#39;ll attempt here.<br/>
<br/>
Emily (age 13) has spent the past two days running back and forth<br/>
between the computer and the playstation trying to get through a<br/>
certain land on Kingdom Hearts II.  She very focused on trying to get<br/>
out of this one area that she is stuck on.  She&#39;s been on message<br/>
boards and IMing friends and looking up walk throughs and cheats.<br/>
What has she learned?  Hmmm.  All the things I listed above,<br/>
interpersonal communication skills, research skills and that the cat<br/>
box needed changing (which she did).<br/>
<br/>
Mary Elayne (age 10) has been mostly watching this, reading a few<br/>
books, hula hooping, helping me with tidying up the kitchen, watching<br/>
a few movies with me, dancing, singing, and eating ice cream.  What<br/>
has she learned?  Probably all the above, plus rhythm, tempo, scales,<br/>
and a host of things from asking a million (and one) questions while<br/>
watching movies.<br/>
<br/>
Keon (age 8 in 2 weeks) has also been helping Emily work through this<br/>
one problem.  He&#39;s eaten a ton of cereal while doing so.  Today he<br/>
made his sisters lunch (ramen noodles) and figured out how to make a<br/>
double batch rather than making two seperate batches.  Water the<br/>
garden and harvesting some ripe vegetables.  What has he learned?<br/>
TONS!  It&#39;s amazing to watch his mind go.  It&#39;s fantastic to see him<br/>
get so excited over a cucumber!<br/>
<br/>
Michelle (age 41 on Sunday)  I&#39;ve been watching this whole event<br/>
unfold.  I&#39;ve washed a bit of laundry, tidied a few rooms, done some<br/>
tai chi, pet the cat, read 3 books (yes; in two days), cooked a few<br/>
meals, done a few dishes, went out with the kids for ice cream when<br/>
they all looked like they could use a break, dealt with a newspaper<br/>
delivery issue, wrote out bills, dealt with a problem a friend was<br/>
having, answered a help call from La Leche League and remembered to<br/>
leave the light on for my coparent who was coming home late.  What<br/>
have I learned?  I think you get the picture.  I *hope* you get the<br/>
picture!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-939046612">Hi everyone,<br/>
I am really enjoying this discussion.  I just started unschooling and am struggling with this very issue.<br/>
Math- my problem is that my son wants to be an engineer or architect which means lots of math.  Not just your everyday math mind you.  So what do you do then?<br/>
 Reading- my 6 year old wants to learn to read badly...mainly because he can&#39;t read what is on his Pokemon gameboy game.  : )  So I thought I would sit down with him Teach Your Child to Read in 100 easy lessons.  They are short lessons.  Would you all agree with this?<br/>
<br/>
I really want my kids to have a good basis in reading and math which yes comes from everyday life.  It&#39;s the more advanced stuff they may need later on in life for college that I am worried about.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading.<br/>
<br/>

  &gt;My kids and I have bounced back and forth from unschooling, to<br/>
  &gt;curriculum to cyber schools throughout the years. They are happiest<br/>
  &gt;when unschooling, but I always chicken out and make them do work<br/>
  &gt;before too long.<br/>
<br/>
  One reason they may be reluctant to venture away <br/>
  from the things they love doing to the exclusion <br/>
  of anything else is that they may be anticipating <br/>
  the return to being made to do stuff. They may <br/>
  be waiting for you to chicken out once again and <br/>
  put an end to their freedom of choice. But, you <br/>
  said yourself that they are happiest when <br/>
  unschooling, and happiness can be the most educational thing of all!<br/>
<br/>
  Having said all that, what would do you think it <br/>
  would look like for them to &quot;choose to do <br/>
  anything educational&quot;? Are you expecting them to <br/>
  walk over to the bookshelf and grab a physics <br/>
  textbook? Or a spelling workbook? Why on earth would they do that?<br/>
<br/>
  If you could relax a little with this thing, you <br/>
  could begin to see how all the things they need <br/>
  to learn are contained in the passions they <br/>
  gravitate to (pardon the dangling <br/>
  preposition!). My 11¬Ω-year-old son loves to play <br/>
  Yu-Gi-Oh, he loves to play World of Warcraft, and <br/>
  he loves to play various video games. There are <br/>
  a few TV shows he likes to watch. None of this <br/>
  stuff would look educational to most folks, but <br/>
  he learns from everything he does! He is <br/>
  learning to read, to write, to spell, to <br/>
  calculate, to understand time, and to solve <br/>
  problems. He is learning to research and wants <br/>
  to design his own video games. He&#39;s not an avid <br/>
  book reader; he&#39;s just not interested. But, as <br/>
  we drive down the road he loves to try to read <br/>
  just about every sign he can, and we talk about <br/>
  it all. He loves to buy new Yu-Gi-Oh cards, and <br/>
  he has to figure out how he&#39;ll afford to buy what <br/>
  he wants. He budgets for this. He does amazing <br/>
  calculations in his head to keep score during YGO <br/>
  duels! He astounds me!! He has to write <br/>
  messages to his co-players on WoW on the fly. He <br/>
  has to read prompts and other information on <br/>
  video games. He has to navigate around a large <br/>
  map on WoW. I would be honored and delighted to <br/>
  help him, if he asks, but he rarely, if ever, does!<br/>
<br/>
  A year ago, he was not reading or writing at <br/>
  all. I had no idea about the kinds of <br/>
  calculations he was able to do because I don&#39;t <br/>
  test him (of course), but he has an amazing mind for calculation.<br/>
<br/>
  If he ever needs to, I have no doubt he will be <br/>
  able to pass any basic skills test without <br/>
  breaking a sweat. He has never chosen anything <br/>
  &quot;educational,&quot; and yet he seems quite <br/>
  educated! And, he&#39;s really nice and wonderful to <br/>
  be with and we NEVER lock horns about what he&#39;s <br/>
  doing. He feels honored and respected, and he <br/>
  respects me, too. All of this, I believe, stems <br/>
  from his choices being honored.<br/>
<br/>
  Try to see what the educational perks are of the <br/>
  things your kids love to do. Try to see how <br/>
  they&#39;re absorbing the information they need from <br/>
  what they love to do. Most of all, try to resist <br/>
  the urge to disturb their process; let them be <br/>
  and they will be free to chose more and more <br/>
  things, and you will be amazed at how &quot;educational&quot; their choices really are!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1334668922">We were watching an Addam&#39;s Family marathon recently and there was an <br/>
episode (it might have been the first one) where a truant office <br/>

age, had not been attending school.  Gomez asks the TO why they <br/>
should have to go to school.  The TO suggests that the kids may want <br/>
to be able to get a job when they&#39;re 26 years old, and Gomez, <br/>
grinning with a cigar in his teeth, says, &quot;Well, come and speak to me then!&quot;<br/>

I recall reading engineering and other scientific  do not necessarily <br/>
require the kinds of math skills that we think they do.  I&#39;m sure <br/>
someone else reading this list will remember that better than <br/>
me.  Having said that, the best preparation for that kind of thing is <br/>
supporting you so to do things:  building a birdhouse from scratch, <br/>
helping plan the steps on a deck you&#39;re building or bookcases or <br/>
whatever.  We just built three raised garden beds, and it took a <br/>
certain amount of calculation to determine how much wood we&#39;d need <br/>
and how much top soil and compost we&#39;d need to fill the beds.  That <br/>
kind of stuff.  Real world stuff you and he can do together.<br/>

whatever needs to be read until he can do it himself.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I really want my kids to have a good basis in reading and math which <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t worry about it!!  When they need it, they&#39;ll learn it <br/>
then!  And, they&#39;ll learn it better than they would if they learned <br/>
it before they needed it!<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a brief anecdote:  When my son was born, I was determined not <br/>
to go back to working outside the house &#39;cause I wanted him to have a <br/>
free uninstitutionalized life.  I wanted to work from home, and I <br/>
could type, so I thought I&#39;d try to get work typing manuscripts and <br/>
stuff like that.  Someone suggested that medical transcription would <br/>
be very lucrative, but you need to learn how to do it.  I took a <br/>
course and learned everything I needed to know.  I needed to know it, <br/>
so I learned it.  It was a lot of the same basic anatomy stuff that I <br/>
had learned in school, but I didn&#39;t need to know it then, so I forgot <br/>
it; in fact, I never *really* learned it.  But, now, when I needed <br/>
it, I had no problem learning it.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, kids who live a free life, are learning something <br/>
much better than all that external stuff.  They&#39;re learning their own <br/>
minds!  And, I think that gives them an edge over most other folks!<br/>

about strewing information he needs to know about the consequences of <br/>

about folks who aren&#39;t so lucky.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid I remember reading a story (for my own enjoyment, in <br/>
fact) about a kid who found a leftover firework on the 5th of July <br/>
and he and his buddy exploded it and the kid lost his eyesight <br/>
permanently.  The book was actually about this kid becoming <br/>
functional again with the aid of a guide dog, but the part about the <br/>
firework *really* impressed me, and I made it a point to steer really <br/>
clear of those kinds of things!  To show you how impressed I was, I <br/>
remember it to this day, and I was probably 10 or 11 when I read the <br/>
book (about 37 years ago!).<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you can find something for your son that would be able to <br/>
impress him as well.<br/>

This doesn&#39;t require an answer from you, it&#39;s something I want you to think about before I answer.<br/>
<br/>
1. They could get a GED study book and retake it.<br/>
2. The could join the military and let THEM pay for school.<br/>
3. They could inherit some money  and use that to pay for school.<br/>
4. They could have a job that will pay for school.<br/>
5. They could start by taking community college classes which are MUCH cheaper and pay as they go out of their own earnings.<br/>
6. They could win the lottery.<br/>
7. They could find a mentor and learn that way.<br/>

BIG DEAL!! Seriously. Is it really a big deal to fail the GED?<br/>
Ye-gads, NO!! THey&#39;ll LEARN from it. <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re spending a lot of time worrying about things that aren&#39;t even<br/>
on the horizon. You&#39;re taking a lot of responsibility onto yourself<br/>
that could backfire on you. If you see it as YOUR responsibility to<br/>
prepare your kids for a bunch of unknown factors, then they&#39;ll surely<br/>
blame you when things go wrong.<br/>
<br/>
How about supporting whatever (safe) interests they have now? How<br/>
about TRUSTING that they are intelligent human beings that can use<br/>
college, or GED&#39;s or anything in the world to achieve their goals if<br/>
they choose it!??<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-62742042">sounds like he&#39;s seeking power. If he&#39;s in awe of guys who can do  <br/>
powerful things, control their environment and get what they want...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not trying to be critical, but when you say &#39;we talk&#39;, do you  <br/>
mean that you both really talk, or does it come down to you getting  <br/>
to say what is right or wrong? Why does he think hacking is ethical?  <br/>
Isn&#39;t there a line between, say, hacking for bank numbers or hacking  <br/>
for a free game cheat? Where does he draw the line? Can you ask him  <br/>
maybe someday, what would be the consequence for x, y or z?<br/>
<br/>
I think if you encourage the reading, he&#39;ll hate it more. If you  <br/>
worry he&#39;ll become a criminal, he&#39;ll live up to your expectation. I  <br/>
have a friend from Cuba. She says that there is a saying there, you  <br/>
NEVER say anything negative about your children, the spirits hear it  <br/>
and help them become it. Don&#39;t &#39;use&#39; the interest, provide positive  <br/>
ones. Be willing to hear him talk about the negative ones without  <br/>
criticizing. On the radical christian unschooling board, there is a  <br/>
really great discussion about porn right now...the last post I read  <br/>
was saying that we are here to provide role models, but you cannot  <br/>
force your children to live your life. You can say &quot;I&#39;m really  <br/>
uncomfortable with this because it goes against my ethics, but you  <br/>
cannot force the development of another persons ethics. Or something  <br/>
like that.<br/>

online and did some searching.  Went to several state universities and<br/>
even a few private ones in your state (providing that your kids would<br/>
want to attend college in your state).  After a quick glance, what I<br/>
found (and what I suspected) is that the PHEAA  is not the only way to<br/>
fund college.  The requirements for PHEAA does mention diploma or GED<br/>
but I only found this information in individual school sites.  I did<br/>
not find it on the PHEAA site *and* many of the school websites didn&#39;t<br/>
even mention diploma or GED but said, &quot;Accepted into a course of<br/>
study.&quot;  I&#39;m thinking this may be new terminology thanks to<br/>
homeschoolers :)<br/>
<br/>
Besides, if your child is ready to go to college and has the desire to<br/>
go to college I am sure that taking the GED is just another step.<br/>
There are quite a few &quot;GED practice tests&quot; online.  I took one not<br/>
long ago.  I found it droll, simple and laughable.<br/>
<br/>
Stop putting up roadblocks that really aren&#39;t there.  Trust your kids!<br/>
 They&#39;ll figure it out or they will ask you for help.  When we force<br/>
our children to &quot;learn&quot; what we think they should know because of some<br/>
fear, we *limit* what they can become rather than help open doors to<br/>
what they what to become!<br/>

&gt; I am really enjoying this discussion. I just started unschooling and am struggling with this very issue.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is this the 6yo?  He knows he wants to be an engineer or architect.<br/>
That&#39;s great.  If so he will find the math as he finds architecture<br/>
and engineering!  And I have met so many neat people who never &quot;got<br/>
math&quot; when they were younger excel at math when they got older because<br/>
they could see the way math was used in a practical sense.  We all use<br/>
math everyday, but if I were to take higher math it would go over my<br/>
head because I couldnt&#39; see the application for that math.  Oh oh oh<br/>
oh oh, does someone have that link to that really cool engineering<br/>

They are short lessons. Would you all agree with this?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>BTDT threw the book away!  It is the most droll and boring way to<br/>
learn to read.  If you child wants to learn to read then sit with him<br/>
and read to and with him.  Help him see words he recognizes like Buger<br/>
King, McDonald&#39;s, The Zoo, Wendy&#39;s, Walgreen&#39;s, Target, STOP, YIELD,<br/>
Main Street, ToYOta :), University Boulevard, all the words he<br/>
encounters every day.  Sit with his Yu-gi-oh cards and read them with<br/>
him.  Help him learn how they are arranged and the information on them<br/>
and how to decipher it all.  I know little kids that can barely read<br/>
that do just fine playing Magic cards once they are taught to decipher<br/>
them!<br/>
<br/>

&gt; I really want my kids to have a good basis in reading and math which yes comes from everyday life. It&#39;s the more advanced stuff they may need later on in life for college that I am worried about.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hey Jess, it&#39;s ok.  Breathe.  :)  They&#39;ll get there.  Trust us.  There<br/>
are quite a few seasoned moms here who have grown children who are<br/>
doing just fine and have gotten the things that they have needed when<br/>
they needed them thanks to mindful parenting and being allowed the joy<br/>
of following their interestes!<br/>
