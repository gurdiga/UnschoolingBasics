<div id="ygrps-yiv-521005544">Not in OH but a summary (which OH people can fill out with detail on <br/>
what is involved more and whether it varies in &#39;strictness&#39; from <br/>
district to district)<br/>
<br/>
You have to have a high school diploma or GED<br/>
Submit an annual Notice of Intent to the local superintendent<br/>
With the NOI each year, submit one of the following:<br/>
   standardized test scores<br/>
   written narrative showing &quot;adequate progress&quot;<br/>
   &quot;approved alternate assessment&quot;<br/>
There is a 900 hour requirement but no requirement to document the <br/>
hours at all - I guess they assume that if &quot;adequate progress&quot; is <br/>
made, you &quot;had to&quot; have put in the hours <br/>
<br/>
Required subjects are: langauge arts, geography, US and Ohio <br/>
history, government, math, health, PE, first aid, fine arts, and <br/>
science<br/>
<br/>
There is no requirement to submit any kind of &quot;Curriculum plan&quot; <br/>
or &quot;lesson plan&quot; ahead of time - it&#39;s all assessment after the fact.<br/>
