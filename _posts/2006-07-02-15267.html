<div id="ygrps-yiv-1879578403">I&#39;m trying real hard to word this right, so please be patient with <br/>
me.  As some of you know we have three unschoolers at home...one <br/>
veteran and two newbies.  My particular tough spot is with my newest <br/>
newbie, Andrew-14.  <br/>
<br/>
Andrew came home from public school at Easter Break.  Honestly, I <br/>
knew ahead of time that it would be challenging for us to adjust to <br/>
having him home 24/7.  Andrew really enjoyed the social aspect of <br/>
school.  He has concerns about still being able to go into the <br/>
military being homeschooled.  (We&#39;ve discussed that here <br/>
previously...his fears are still prevelent)  He was getting in <br/>
trouble on a regular basis for &quot;insubordination&quot; at school.  For <br/>
lack of better way to put it he really had/has an attitude.  What <br/>
some traditional parents would maybe call a &quot;chip on his shoulder&quot;.  <br/>
He can come of real cocky.  <br/>
<br/>
From what I have learned so far I am trying to view this <br/>
differently.  I went through things like this with the four older <br/>
girls and hadled it poorly.  I knew nothing of what I know now, <br/>
then.  Now I know, and I LONG to do better by us all.  Deep down <br/>
I&#39;ve always known there just HAD to be a better way, but old <br/>
reflexes jump right in when no new ones are learned.  :-(<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I am SO struggling with relating to him.  In the negative <br/>
sense he is disrespectful and rude.  It&#39;s not just with me, although <br/>
mostly it is, it&#39;s with the whole family.  It&#39;s SO hard to take, and <br/>
I really, really don&#39;t have the &quot;tools&quot; to grab onto to handle the <br/>
situations as they arise in a more positive manner.  It&#39;s SO hard to <br/>
stomach.  Can anyone shed a light on the positive parenting <br/>
necessary to help a child through a tough spot?<br/>
<br/>
I can try to give an example if necessary, but right now I am having <br/>
difficulty putting it into words.  I just want to be able to handle <br/>
a situation that would stereotypically be labled rude or <br/>
disrespectful.  Let me know if you need more info...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks - Tina</div>
