<div id="ygrps-yiv-1908738446">&quot; All we may have the right to do is enclose our personal field<br/>
(hopefully with gates!) although we can/should help our children <br/>
with their<br/>
constructions....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really glad you pointed this out Robyn. I love the analogy.<br/>
<br/>
At first, when I re-read that post, I thought &quot;boundaries&quot; sounded a <br/>
bit harsh. But with all the discussion about boundaries and what it <br/>
means in the unschooling context, I went ahead and left it. I&#39;m glad <br/>
you brought this up to further clarify just what boundaries are.<br/>
<br/>
I also see boundaries as the safety issues in the early years, where <br/>
we do set limits our kids may not like, but would like, if they <br/>
understood the danger to them. <br/>
Or keeping them safe from truly harmful people when they are <br/>
unable....like who we allow into our home.<br/>

our lives.&quot;  <br/>
