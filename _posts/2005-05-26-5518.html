<div id="ygrps-yiv-102352622">I have 2 children in which I homeschool. 1 i pulled<br/>
from ps at 13. She preferred a more structured setting<br/>
so that&#39;s how we proceeded for the last 3/4 yrs. Now<br/>
She&#39;s just &quot;doing her own thing&quot;. She&#39;s maturing,<br/>
growing & finding her own interests. <br/>
<br/>
Questions.--She&#39;s 16; do I &quot;have to&quot; continue to<br/>
report? If not what is the law on this & where do I<br/>
find it?<br/>
<br/>
2) My 4 yr old daughter will be hs&#39;d & I would prefer<br/>
an unschooling lifestyle. How do you write up the<br/>
reports/portfolios for the School system to review?<br/>
<br/>
Any help would be appreciated.<br/>
Thank-U, Tammy<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The law varies from state to state just like homeschooling laws vary <br/>
from state to state. So you&#39;d want to check that the same as you <br/>
would for homeschooling - often the same website that you get your <br/>
homeschooling law from would have that info. Generally, if <br/>
you &quot;graduate&quot; her, that&#39;s it - after all, some 16 yr olds graduate <br/>
from public school, don&#39;t they? <br/>
<br/>
Next question: do you &#39;have to&#39; report anything at all anyhow? Don&#39;t <br/>
go by what the school told you - check the laws<br/>
<br/>
For the 4 yr old, you&#39;ve got anywhere from 1 to 4 years before you <br/>
have to do any kind of reporting, depending on where you live. That <br/>
should give you time to check the laws and figure out the least <br/>
restrictive means of doing things - some states have 2, 3, even 4 or <br/>
more options available for homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
You can look it up or, if you tell us where you live, I&#39;m sure <br/>
someone around here is familiar with your state laws.</div>

<br/>
All states are different.<br/>
<br/>
Go to www.nhen.org and go to the Legal Info button, then go to your state.<br/>
Also the County Contacts button will have contact information for local and<br/>
Statewide groups - your best source for what people actually do to fulfill<br/>
the state requirements - and often a good place to find congenial reviewers<br/>
if that applies.<br/>
<br/>
Let us know what state you are in and folks will have ideas about the<br/>
portfolios.<br/>
