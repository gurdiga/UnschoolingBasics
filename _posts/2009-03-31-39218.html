<br/>
We really love the idea of moving to Colorado in fact booked tickets today to take a week and peak in May.  But reading the homeschool &quot;law&quot; is scary.  Does anyone live there now and is there anyway to get &quot;around&quot; the testing & etc.?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you ~ Angela</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-981347414">Here are a couple of Colorado lists where you can find information  <br/>
about the homeschooling laws.  You&#39;re also welcome to email me  <br/>
privately with questions.  Oddly, or interestingly, I&#39;ve been  <br/>
answering lots of CO homeschool law questions and had my nose in the  <br/>
revised statutes, lately.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1641236943">Good Day, Angela.<br/>
<br/>
My family and I moved to Colorado Springs 6 months ago.  We took a peak last June and decided it was perfect for us!  Like you, I checked out the CO homeschooling laws before deciding to even take a peak.  As an unschooler, I wanted to continue doing what was working for us.  After reviewing CO law and talking with members from various support groups, I decided to go with an umbrella group called West River Academy.  This umbrella group is for unschoolers.  (I do not want to be bothered with testing as well.  That was another reason for going with an umbrella group.)    <br/>
<br/>
If you are planning to visit or move to this area of Colorado, and would like to connect, I&#39;d be happy to meet with you.  You are welcome to contact me directly.  <br/>
<br/>
Good Luck in your decision!<br/>
<br/>
