<div><font face="Arial">&gt;Out in mainstream society, I am a homeschooler. Homeschooling is <br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;huge and wide and encompasses all of us that choose any kind of home <br>&gt;education...yes. But within the homeschooling community, it is <br>&gt;helpful to have those distinctions, for better and more efficient <br>&gt;communication.</span></blockquote></font></div>

<div><font face="Arial">Helen answered:</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial">I agree. But over the course of time I finally came to the conclusion <br>that those distinctions were being taken to an extreme, and instead <br>of facilitating better and more efficient communication, the result <br>was less and less communication.</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial">No kidding. This has certainly been a year for building walls instead of bridges. </font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div><font face="Arial">In addition to the unschoolers and other hsers within the homeschooling community, there are a number of other barriers which have been erected/solidified recently.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial">Here are two to start with -- </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div><font face="Arial">What of all the families who choose to hs using the charterhomeschooling option available in their area? How could we all do a better job of reaching out to them as one big hsing community?</font></div></div>
<div><font face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial">What about all the hsers who are members of HSLDA. Or just the one HSLDA attorney who has attempted to bridge the communication gap -- Scott Sommerville. How do you see communication improving in that direction?</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial">I hope I have understood your ambition correctly, Helen. This seems like a major step in the right direction to me -- open communciation between different groups within the hsing community, as opposed to increased distancing.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial">I&#39;ll look forward to your clarification.</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial">(Not sure if I sent an intro here yet -- I am an unschooler living in FL with my two glorious children and fabulous DH. I established a private school for hsers called Florida Unschoolers (many of the families are unschoolers, as far as I know, but many are not -- I am, that&#39;s all I check on. :) ). I am also the co-owner of the PDE website and discussion list -- </font><a rel="nofollow" title="http://www.parentdirectededucation.org/" target="_blank" href="http://www.parentdirectededucation.org/"><font face="Arial">www.ParentDirectedEducation.org</font></a><font face="Arial">. And I volunteer for NHEN and FCAR. &nbsp;And I have to go start dinner! :) )</font></div>

I don&#39;t know your position, where your website is or who &quot;we&quot; is.  <br/>
Would you care to share what website you are refering to and with <br/>
what organization you are affiliated, if any?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks - Tina</div>

 </span></blockquote>Sure, Tina. &quot;We&quot; means myself and my husband, Mark - we publish Home <br/>
Education Magazine:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.home-ed-magazine.com">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>
<br/>
Our affiliations include being founding members of the American <br/>
Homeschool Association, the National Homeschool Association, the <br/>
National Home Education Network, the Alaska Homeschool Network, and <br/>
at least two other national organizations and two state groups in <br/>
Washington.<br/>
<br/>
Other affiliations include: The Independent Publishers Association, <br/>
The Association of Educational Publishers (EdPress), Publishers <br/>
Marketing Association, Co-Op America and a few more.<br/>
<br/>
As far as our position on the two issues Nance raised:<br/>
<br/>
We do not equate charterschooling with homeschooling. For more <br/>
information I recommend:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/_hem-westandintro.html">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/_hem-westandintro.html</a><br/>
<br/>
And we feel HSLDA has done more harm than good within the <br/>
homeschooling community. For more information about that I recommend <br/>
this site:<br/>

Thanks for asking!<br/>

<br/>
Thank you for clarifying.  It is much more easy to understand the <br/>
posting now that I know who you are.  I will check out the links that <br/>
recommended.  I&#39;ve never really delved into any of the political <br/>
aspects of homeschooling or technicalities or anything like that.  I <br/>
appreciate the &quot;bird&#39;s eye view.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks - Tina</div>
