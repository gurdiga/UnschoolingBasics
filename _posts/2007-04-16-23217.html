<div id="ygrps-yiv-1693179222">DH and I are in the process of adopting through DSS. We are focusing <br/>
on two particular girls (ages 12 and 14) but since we know that things <br/>
can change, we&#39;ve included an possible age range of 7-15. I&#39;m assuming <br/>
the girls currently attend public school. The way it works is after we <br/>
all meet and our requirements are fulfilled, they move in for 6 months <br/>
to a year before the adoption is legalized. I was thinking that in <br/>
that time I would continue to send them to public school (just in case <br/>
for whatever reason it didn&#39;t work out, that way they would still be <br/>
used to the system), then after it was legalized, ask them what they <br/>
wanted to do. I figure 12 and 14 years old is old enough to make their <br/>
own decision about schooling, even though I would love to unschool <br/>
them. Anyone have any thoughts on this? Anyone been through it? My <br/>
kids are only 8 months and almost 3, so this would be a whole new <br/>
ballgame.<br/>

until you are final. <br/>

Our last placement was a nearly seven year old. He had moved and <br/>
moved and been in several schools after having big life losses. <br/>
Guess what he did not do very well, disruptive and stuff like that.<br/>
<br/>
When he was placed I was very clear that my condition was he be <br/>
allowed to homeschool with my other kids. My feeling was he needed <br/>
to be surrounded by his family. To feel the security that a small <br/>
baby has the luxury of. It worked well for him.He was with us every <br/>
moment for the past two years and now can comfortably go with other <br/>
folks for a bit without feeling insecure.<br/>
<br/>
I do not think that kids who are in  the midst of loss and change as <br/>
huge as a new family are really in a place to face schools stupid <br/>
expectation. WAIT I am not sure anyone is, different story.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway good luck with your adoption.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-968450807">I wanted to second the congratulations, and wish you luck. While we&#39;re not adopting, we&#39;ve <br/>
fostered a couple of children and never have had problems with homeschooling them. Maybe <br/>
it depends not only on the state but also your particular caseworker.<br/>
