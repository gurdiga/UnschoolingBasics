<div id="ygrps-yiv-1029716454">I wanted to comment about TV and visual stimulation.<br/>
<br/>
We have pretty minimal TV reception and my husband and I rarely watch<br/>
(except for particular events on occasion).  I know that I would get hooked<br/>
on some cable channels (history, nature, A&E etc) but I prefer reading.  A<br/>
quiet night together with my husband (if we don&#39;t go<br/>
dancing....contras/square, swing, or vintage ballroom)...is usually a nice<br/>
beverage and a book that I read out loud (we&#39;ve been through JRR Tolkien, JK<br/>
Rowling, B. Jacques, R. Jordan...and the kids get in on it whenever we&#39;re<br/>
all together...car rides and such...I read out loud to them all the time,<br/>
too)...we would rather get on with our book than turn on TV.<br/>
<br/>
So, the kids are not usually much interested...except for movies and games.<br/>
<br/>
I am not a &quot;movie person&quot; (I do love some, but they can be hard on me...I<br/>
have to be very selective), and my son is like me...where he must be careful<br/>
about visual images that he sees and that linger with him.  We are both<br/>
still &quot;haunted&quot; by some things watched (TV and movies).<br/>
<br/>
And then there is ocular lock...where the brain cross-hemispheric<br/>
functioning becomes limited and the brain&#39;s function is rerouted<br/>
homolaterally (only one side) with any flat screen visual stimulation.  It&#39;s<br/>
not that it&#39;s all bad...it&#39;s just only one kind and limiting.  It is better<br/>
to have a variety of activities over the course of the day.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the same in everything...variety...food* over the course of a day (or<br/>
week...doesn&#39;t matter what order it goes in!), exercise, play, stimulation.<br/>
Every hour or so (the timing is more critical for certain peoples&#39; brains)<br/>
it is good to &quot;look&quot; and interact with something different for<br/>
awhile...longer view (outdoors) after close up work, moving around when<br/>
having stared at (any kind of) a screen for a period of time....and most<br/>
importantly...the physical activity, cross-hemispheric integration and whole<br/>
body function aspect of the human learning and growing experience (also for<br/>
one&#39;s whole life).  This is the work of Brain Gym, martial arts, yoga,<br/>
dance, Nia, and so many other understandings of the broader meaning of<br/>
learning, and health!<br/>
<br/>
*I was reminded again about making sure that it (food) does go in<br/>
regularly...my son&#39;s mood really goes haywire if he gets so deeply<br/>
interested in something when we&#39;re out somewhere else, that makes him seem<br/>
to need to be grasp it more tightly (de-schooling still in process), says<br/>
he&#39;s not hungry and is dragging his feet to eat...and waits too long.  I<br/>
still must keep that schedule in mind when planning any outside activities<br/>
he wants to do...(this is huge stressor even though he wants some of it),<br/>
and he is 11.  At home this is not a problem...I leave food ready for him,<br/>
or he chooses something on his own...trusting himself to manage it and I<br/>
stay out of it!.  Outside things are still more stressful (another reason<br/>
leaving school was a blessing) and his awareness (of his own feelings and<br/>
things around him) is less grounded and clear yet.<br/>
<br/>
I believe (based on so many people&#39;s work and research...and much personal<br/>
experience) that much learning is hindered by limited types of<br/>
input/experience of the world around us.  We have a culture of human beings<br/>
who know little about the range (of motion AND understanding) for which<br/>
their bodies have potential.  Not (necessarily) for the purpose of<br/>
comparison or competition...but for the joy of what it means to be human and<br/>
in the world.....and how using the body is a path to so many things...rhythm<br/>
and music, perception, relationship, joy, beauty and self acceptance.  This<br/>
is the way to much high self esteem, key to successful relationships and<br/>
happier people.<br/>
<br/>
So my concern remains...that although there is so much wondrous information<br/>
and opportunity on (cable) TV nowadays....there is a less emphasis on<br/>
participation when there is so much access to the world vicariously and<br/>
visually.  We need both...and I bring this as part of the bigger discussion<br/>
in our family culture.  It is harder to find acceptance and joy in our<br/>
bodies if we don&#39;t know them or trust what they can learn and do.  The<br/>
long-term health concerns of bodies long unstimulated are manifest in the<br/>
world around us.  The joy some adults find later through the myriad<br/>
possibilities (sports, dance, yoga, anything) invariably are accompanied by<br/>
the wishes that they had been able to do it all their lives, and injury<br/>
free...rather than be afraid of &quot;looking weird&quot; or thinking &quot;I can&#39;t&quot; etc.<br/>
Let&#39;s have this be the norm...the joy from childhood we never lose!   Be a<br/>
role model for those around you!<br/>
