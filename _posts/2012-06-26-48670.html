<div id="ygrps-yiv-2136003562">we did a few of these last summer, and even checked for theaters in cities we traveled to. its an inexpensive -and air conditioned- option over the summer that can save a few dollars. not aÂ  bad start to a day trip to NH or CT either<br/>

&quot;Moviegoers of all ages can climb aboard the Summer Movie Express to <br/>

participating Regal Cinemas, United Artists and Edwards Theatres will <br/>
offer selected G or PG rated movies for only a dollar on Tuesday and <br/>
Wednesday mornings at 10:00. A portion of proceeds from the Summer Movie<br/>
 Express will be donated to the Will Rogers Institute.&quot;<br/>
