<div id="ygrps-yiv-1344835820">Hello again,<br/>
<br/>
As I seriously reconsider the unschooling lifestyle/mindset, I have <br/>
been trying to let go of my hang-ups on regulating food.  This is a <br/>
topic I have seen much discussion about, but was not really ready for <br/>
until now.  It came up after one of my recent posts to the discipline <br/>
board, but I thought it might be more appropriate to pursue the <br/>
conversation here.<br/>
<br/>
I have been very confused and hung up on making healthy diet choices <br/>
for my children since birth.  I have always thought it was my duty as <br/>
a parent to see that they eat right, and have limited sweets, etc.  I <br/>
have been very skeptical as to how kids can learn right choices about <br/>
food at young ages, if they are allowed to eat what they choose.  I <br/>
always thought kids will of COURSE choose what tastes good, and of <br/>
COURSE sweets and junk food taste better than most other things!  <br/>
After all, when they are very young, they cannot understand what <br/>
healthy means. To me, this has been logical thinking. <br/>
<br/>
As I posted on another list: My hang-up is that my older dd is very <br/>
picky, and I worry she will not get enough healthy food in without <br/>
intervention. If we allow her to snack/drink before a meal, she will <br/>
not eat the meal, etc. When she stays at my mother&#39;s, she is allowed <br/>
anything she pleases (unlimited sweets), and therefore rarely eats <br/>
healthy food over there. I notice she whines and begs over food <br/>
there, and then she comes home and throws up or keeps me up all <br/>
night. It really irks me. I keep coming back to the thinking that she <br/>
is not mature enough to self-regulate in this area.<br/>
<br/>
I got several responses from another list that have made me re-think, <br/>
and over the last several days, I have allowed Orion more freedom in <br/>
choosing what she eats when.  Unfortunately (or fortunately?) this <br/>
was a holiday weekend and everywhere we went, there were sweets and <br/>
junk food.  She has gorged herself full of both and eaten very little <br/>
healthier food.  I inwardly almost had a heart attack over what she <br/>
consumed at these family gatherings. Surprisingly, she did not get <br/>
sick this time, but I almost did!<br/>
<br/>
I have been trying to communicate my feelings and opinions about her <br/>
food choices instead of controlling, to which she has listened but <br/>
still chose to eat chips over pasta salad, etc.  I have been told <br/>
that a child will binge when first tasting (ha) freedom, but then <br/>
what can I expect?  It is not easy to sit back and wait to see.  I <br/>
feel such a sense of parental responsibility for her health!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Melissa Z.</div>

 </span></blockquote>I believe that is so.  Once the novelty wears off, it should settle <br/>
down.  Plus, don&#39;t forget to have plenty of good stuff around the <br/>
house - fruit, melon, string cheese, etc... as well as some sweets. <br/>
How about making some chocolate covered bananas or caramel apples?  <br/>
It&#39;s fun to do, tastes good, and you get sweets and fruit all at <br/>
once.  :) <br/>
<br/>
I was more &quot;controlling&quot; about it with my girls - especially the <br/>
oldest who is 20 now.  By the time my son came along (now 8), I was <br/>
pretty lax.  (We&#39;ve even had &quot;dessert&quot; before dinner, or instead of -<br/>
 one of my faves was the occasional hot fudge sundae for lunch.  Why <br/>
not?  If you want a hot fudge sundae, what is the sense in filling <br/>
up on food that is &quot;good&quot; for you first - then you&#39;re full and the <br/>
sundae isn&#39;t nearly so enjoyable.)  He&#39;s actually the best eater of <br/>
the three of them as far as choosing &quot;good&quot; foods.<br/>
<br/>
And here&#39;s a fine example of the result.  The other day, we went to <br/>
a restaurant.  He ordered not from the children&#39;s menu, but from the <br/>
adult side dishes - he usually orders from the adult menu as he <br/>
likes the variety.  Anyway, he ordered 3 slices of bacon, cottage <br/>
cheese, and a half a cantalope.  That may not be overall the <br/>
healthiest combo on the planet, but it&#39;s better than deep fried <br/>
chicken chunks and french fries (the only thing ever on a kids <br/>
meal!)... The waitress asked how we got him to eat &quot;healthy&quot;.  He <br/>
said, &quot;I just do it myself&quot;   He eats candy too sometimes, don&#39;t get <br/>
me wrong.  But candy and cheese and fruit and yogurt and cucumber <br/>
slices are all equal choices in his mind... it just depends on his <br/>
mood at the moment.  <br/>
<br/>
And funny, none of my three kids likes cake - we stick candles in <br/>
other things for birthdays - pudding, pizza, shrimp scampi - <br/>
whatever they are into that birthday.  <br/>
<br/>
I had a friend ask what kind of cake my son had for his recent <br/>
birthday.  When we told him that Jay didn&#39;t want a cake - that none <br/>
of the kids even liked cake, the friend said... those kids aren&#39;t <br/>
right.  lol.  He says that a lot - but lovingly.  They&#39;re <br/>
not &quot;normal&quot;... the way they eat, the way they think, the interests <br/>
they pursue, the way they are - and all these things I think is what <br/>
makes them so awesome.  They are definitely themselves - enough so <br/>
that the world seems to take notice sometimes.  Most of all, they&#39;re <br/>
happy.  <br/>

<div><span class="ygrps-yiv-44152831660265600-01062004"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Hi, all.&nbsp; I 
talked with Caelan (shaylin) about the possibility of homeschool next 
year.&nbsp; At first her biggest concerns were:&nbsp; &quot;Do I have to raise my 
hand?&quot;, &quot;Can I just get up if I have to go to the bathroom?&quot;, &quot;Do I have to 
stand when I read something to you?&quot;, and &quot;Do we get recess?&quot;&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; Of 
course, I said yes to the first 3 and no to the 4th.&nbsp; :P&nbsp; Just 
kidding!&nbsp; I was dying!&nbsp; After she started to &quot;get it,&quot; we talked about 
the possibilities.&nbsp; She loved the fact that she would be called names, hit, 
pinched, pushed, or made fun of.&nbsp; How sad is that???&nbsp; The other thing 
she liked was that there were no pop quizzes!&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; Other than that, 
she liked that she would be with me (hey, I got to take it while I still 
can!&nbsp; LOL), and that we could learn whatever she wanted, whenver she wanted 
to learn it instead of waiting for the teacher to get to that topic.&nbsp; After 
talking about it a bit, we decided we would do a little bit this summer to get 
used to the idea (not much, but a little), and then she just started going on 
about everything she wanted to learn!&nbsp; It was great!&nbsp; It was funny, 
because she started trying to come up with ideas for field trips, and her ideas 
were to go to the store to buy something and to go to a family members event 
(like a school play).&nbsp; Ok, so she doesn&#39;t totally get it.....I told her 
those are things we do normally and wouldn&#39;t really qualify as field trips, but 
would qualify as learning!&nbsp; :)&nbsp; So, on to my 
question......</font></span></div>

<div><span class="ygrps-yiv-44152831660265600-01062004"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">The first thing Cae 
wants to learn after school gets out is how to make a teepee and everything 
about them!&nbsp; How cool!&nbsp; So, I need some good resources about where I 
can find a how-to on these if someone has it.&nbsp; I&#39;m thinking we will make 
one big enough for the backyard, but thought we could make one for her dolls if 
that is too much of a chore.&nbsp; The next thing is that she wants to learn 
about &quot;Abraham Lincoln or whoever it was that invented electricity.&quot;&nbsp; Ok, 
what the heck have they been teaching this kid???&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; So, Thomas 
Edison and electricity will be next.....any ideas on cool projects for 
that??&nbsp; I figure that will be good for the summer since she will be doing a 
lot of camping with my mom.&nbsp; She won&#39;t be home too much, so can&#39;t give us 
too much work on our summer break!&nbsp; :)</font></span></div>

<div><span class="ygrps-yiv-44152831660265600-01062004"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Next, I just wanted 
to share a little &quot;unschool&quot; idea/game with y&#39;all.&nbsp; You might already be 
doing this, but Cae loves this game, so I thought I would pass it on....it 
dawned on me what a good learning tool it is, so instead of telling her know, I 
gladly played along with her.&nbsp; ANyway, we play this in the car on trips to 
see our family (2-3 hour drives), but it could be played anywhere.&nbsp; We call 
it the ABC game.&nbsp; You take turns (1 starts with A, then the next B, 
etc).&nbsp; You get 3 guesses to figure out the word they are thinking of.&nbsp; 
After the 2nd guess you can ask for a hint.&nbsp; Rarely do we get it right, and 
sometimes we bend the rules a little (like she gets a 2nd clue out of me, or 
gets one after the 1st guess), but she has a ball and the words she comes up 
with are phenomenal!&nbsp; I didn&#39;t even know she knew some of these!&nbsp; Most 
of her guesses are 7 or more letters!&nbsp; It&#39;s a great vocabulary 
builder.&nbsp; SOmetimes our clues are things like....it ends with a t, or it 
has an r in the middle.&nbsp; Very fun for the kids, because she thinks it&#39;s a 
game, and not learning!</font></span></div>

sweets anytime!&nbsp; I know because I almost always let her choose her

step in and give her different choices (still a choice, but just not the one she 
chose).&nbsp; I will admit there are also times I &quot;dictate&quot; what she can 
have.&nbsp; Just depends, but mostly it&#39;s her choice.&nbsp; Unfortunately, she 
doesn&#39;t choose enough of the good stuff.&nbsp; She&#39;ll eat whatever I put in

constantly (she eats WAY more than I do!), if I let her.&nbsp; I&#39;m hoping we can 
work on that when we start homeschooling....do more with nutrition so maybe 
she&#39;ll start making better choices.&nbsp; She&#39;s gained almost 20 lbs in the last

      all.&nbsp; I talked with Caelan (shaylin) about the possibility of 
      homeschool next year.&nbsp; At first her biggest concerns were:&nbsp; &quot;Do 
      I have to raise my hand?&quot;, &quot;Can I just get up if I have to go to the 
      bathroom?&quot;, &quot;Do I have to stand when I read something to you?&quot;, and &quot;Do we 
      get recess?&quot;&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; Of course, I said yes to the first 3 and no 
      to the 4th.&nbsp; :P&nbsp; Just kidding!&nbsp; I was dying!&nbsp; After 
      she started to &quot;get it,&quot; we talked about the possibilities.&nbsp; She 
      loved the fact that she would be called names, hit, pinched, pushed, or 
      made fun of.&nbsp; How sad is that???&nbsp; The other thing she liked was 
      that there were no pop quizzes!&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; Other than that, she liked 
      that she would be with me (hey, I got to take it while I still can!&nbsp; 
      LOL), and that we could learn whatever she wanted, whenver she wanted to 
      learn it instead of waiting for the teacher to get to that topic.&nbsp; 
      After talking about it a bit, we decided we would do a little bit this 
      summer to get used to the idea (not much, but a little), and then she just 
      started going on about everything she wanted to learn!&nbsp; It was 
      great!&nbsp; It was funny, because she started trying to come up with 
      ideas for field trips, and her ideas were to go to the store to buy 
      something and to go to a family members event (like a school play).&nbsp; 
      Ok, so she doesn&#39;t totally get it.....I told her those are things we do 
      normally and wouldn&#39;t really qualify as field trips, but would qualify as 
      learning!&nbsp; :)&nbsp; So, on to my question......</font></span></div>

      <div><span class="ygrps-yiv-872349000660265600-01062004"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">The first 
      thing Cae wants to learn after school gets out is how to make a teepee and 
      everything about them!&nbsp; How cool!&nbsp; So, I need some good 
      resources about where I can find a how-to on these if someone has 
      it.&nbsp; I&#39;m thinking we will make one big enough for the backyard, but 
      thought we could make one for her dolls if that is too much of a 
      chore.&nbsp; The next thing is that she wants to learn about &quot;Abraham 
      Lincoln or whoever it was that invented electricity.&quot;&nbsp; Ok, what the 
      heck have they been teaching this kid???&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; So, Thomas Edison 
      and electricity will be next.....any ideas on cool projects for 
      that??&nbsp; I figure that will be good for the summer since she will be 
      doing a lot of camping with my mom.&nbsp; She won&#39;t be home too much, so 
      can&#39;t give us too much work on our summer break!&nbsp;

      <div><span class="ygrps-yiv-872349000660265600-01062004"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Next, I just 
      wanted to share a little &quot;unschool&quot; idea/game with y&#39;all.&nbsp; You might 
      already be doing this, but Cae loves this game, so I thought I would pass 
      it on....it dawned on me what a good learning tool it is, so instead of 
      telling her know, I gladly played along with her.&nbsp; ANyway, we play 
      this in the car on trips to see our family (2-3 hour drives), but it could 
      be played anywhere.&nbsp; We call it the ABC game.&nbsp; You take turns (1 
      starts with A, then the next B, etc).&nbsp; You get 3 guesses to figure 
      out the word they are thinking of.&nbsp; After the 2nd guess you can ask 
      for a hint.&nbsp; Rarely do we get it right, and sometimes we bend the 
      rules a little (like she gets a 2nd clue out of me, or gets one after the 
      1st guess), but she has a ball and the words she comes up with are 
      phenomenal!&nbsp; I didn&#39;t even know she knew some of these!&nbsp; Most of 
      her guesses are 7 or more letters!&nbsp; It&#39;s a great vocabulary 
      builder.&nbsp; SOmetimes our clues are things like....it ends with a t, or 
      it has an r in the middle.&nbsp; Very fun for the kids, because she thinks 
      it&#39;s a game, and not learning!</font></span></div>

<br/>
**But if being able to make her own choices was not a special treat <br/>
she wouldn&#39;t feel a need to binge when the opportunity presents <br/>
itself.**<br/>
<br/>
Today we were at my parents&#39; and no sooner had we arrived than a box <br/>
of chocolate covered graham crackers was discovered.  The kids and I <br/>
each had a few (more than I usually allow for a snack), then left the <br/>
garage where they were found.  As we walked away, Orion said she <br/>
wanted more cookies.  I said we left them in the garage.  She said <br/>
she wanted to go back to the garage to see grandpa.  I said, &#39;I think <br/>
you want to go back to the garage to eat more cookies.  I would <br/>
rather you did not do that because I am about to make dinner and I <br/>
think you may be too full to eat the good food I make if you eat <br/>
more&#39;.  She said &#39;no I won&#39;t&#39; and I let her go to the garage.  She <br/>
and sister had several more there, then brought the box back to the <br/>
patio with them.  They took turns playing and coming back for more <br/>
cookies -- Orion eyeballing me all the time, younger dd asking me for <br/>
more.  I allowed it without making a big deal, except to ask Orion if <br/>
she thought eating 10, 11, 12 (TWELVE!!) cookies before dinner was a <br/>
good idea.  She said she would eat dinner, which she of course did <br/>
not.  I tried so  hard not to show my complete frustration, and even <br/>
allowed a popsicle (!!)  before we left, because they beg for one <br/>
when ever we leave there.   <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I have been trying to communicate my feelings and opinions about her<br/>
 </span></blockquote>about her food choices instead of controlling,&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
**I would be careful about doing this.  If she is still getting the <br/>
message that you do not think she will make good choices what she <br/>
chooses could be in reaction to that rather than based on what she <br/>
might actually want.**<br/>
<br/>
I am failing this one in a huge way.  On the way home we stopped at <br/>
my grandmother&#39;s (next door) and she promptly started whining for a <br/>
cookie.  At this point I was losing my patience and focus, and said <br/>
no, because she had so many cookies and a popsicle already, and did <br/>
not eat her dinner. I told her that I would really like to let her <br/>
make her own choices about what she eats, but I would like to see her <br/>
make some healthy choices, so that I know her body will grow <br/>
healthy.  Then I talked a little about sweets and snack foods, and <br/>
the fact that they do not give us energy that lasts, and that is why <br/>
she was still hungry.<br/>
<br/>
As we pulled in the driveway, she said, &#39;Mom, I want a healthy snack <br/>
before bed -- PBJ sandwhich&#39;.  So she had 1 and 1/2 (ALOT for her).  <br/>
We also negotiated milk instead of a can of grape pop (which she <br/>
brought home from family function and is not normally allowed to have <br/>
at all).<br/>
<br/>
So goes our first week of new mindset.  Ugh.  I am so conflicted, and <br/>
hope I am not damaging them in this process!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1593656828">Hi Melissa,<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to jump in and say how glad I am that you brought up<br/>
this issue.  And to offer my support.<br/>
<br/>
We are struggling with just these issues at our house.  My ds Ben is<br/>
4 and his diet is atrocious, when he chooses to eat at all.  (My 11<br/>
month old eats more than he does.) My heart says to step back and let<br/>
him make his own choices about what he eats, but my head says he<br/>
can&#39;t be trusted to make good choices.  But how can he learn to make<br/>
good choices without being able to make his own choices and learn<br/>
from the consequences?  And round it goes.  <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps if it were easier for him to get his own foods that were<br/>
healthy he would eat them more.  It is so easy to pull out a cookie<br/>
or a popsicle or fruit leather.  Not so easy for him to get out<br/>
veggies or fuits or even open a cheese stick.  Hmmm....I&#39;m going to<br/>
make a bowl in the fridge and a bowl in the cupboard of good stuff<br/>
that he can have free access to and see how it goes.....I&#39;ll keep you<br/>
posted!<br/>
<br/>

&gt; pleases <br/>
&gt; (unlimited sweets), and therefore rarely eats healthy food over <br/>
&gt; there.&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; **But if being able to make her own choices was not a special treat<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; she wouldn&#39;t feel a need to binge when the opportunity presents <br/>
&gt; itself.**<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Today we were at my parents&#39; and no sooner had we arrived than a<br/>
&gt; box <br/>
&gt; of chocolate covered graham crackers was discovered.  The kids and<br/>
&gt; I <br/>
&gt; each had a few (more than I usually allow for a snack), then left<br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; garage where they were found.  As we walked away, Orion said she <br/>
&gt; wanted more cookies.  I said we left them in the garage.  She said <br/>
&gt; she wanted to go back to the garage to see grandpa.  I said, &#39;I<br/>
&gt; think <br/>
&gt; you want to go back to the garage to eat more cookies.  I would <br/>
&gt; rather you did not do that because I am about to make dinner and I <br/>
&gt; think you may be too full to eat the good food I make if you eat <br/>
&gt; more&#39;.  She said &#39;no I won&#39;t&#39; and I let her go to the garage.  She <br/>
&gt; and sister had several more there, then brought the box back to the<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; patio with them.  They took turns playing and coming back for more <br/>
&gt; cookies -- Orion eyeballing me all the time, younger dd asking me<br/>
&gt; for <br/>
&gt; more.  I allowed it without making a big deal, except to ask Orion<br/>
&gt; if <br/>
&gt; she thought eating 10, 11, 12 (TWELVE!!) cookies before dinner was<br/>
&gt; a <br/>
&gt; good idea.  She said she would eat dinner, which she of course did <br/>
&gt; not.  I tried so  hard not to show my complete frustration, and<br/>
&gt; even <br/>
&gt; allowed a popsicle (!!)  before we left, because they beg for one <br/>
&gt; when ever we leave there.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;I have been trying to communicate my feelings and opinions about<br/>
&gt; her<br/>
&gt; about her food choices instead of controlling,&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; **I would be careful about doing this.  If she is still getting the<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; message that you do not think she will make good choices what she <br/>
&gt; chooses could be in reaction to that rather than based on what she <br/>
&gt; might actually want.**<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am failing this one in a huge way.  On the way home we stopped at<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; my grandmother&#39;s (next door) and she promptly started whining for a<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; cookie.  At this point I was losing my patience and focus, and said<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; no, because she had so many cookies and a popsicle already, and did<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; not eat her dinner. I told her that I would really like to let her <br/>
&gt; make her own choices about what she eats, but I would like to see<br/>
&gt; her <br/>
&gt; make some healthy choices, so that I know her body will grow <br/>
&gt; healthy.  Then I talked a little about sweets and snack foods, and <br/>
&gt; the fact that they do not give us energy that lasts, and that is<br/>
&gt; why <br/>
&gt; she was still hungry.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As we pulled in the driveway, she said, &#39;Mom, I want a healthy<br/>
&gt; snack <br/>
&gt; before bed -- PBJ sandwhich&#39;.  So she had 1 and 1/2 (ALOT for her).<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; We also negotiated milk instead of a can of grape pop (which she <br/>
&gt; brought home from family function and is not normally allowed to<br/>
&gt; have <br/>
&gt; at all).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So goes our first week of new mindset.  Ugh.  I am so conflicted,<br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; hope I am not damaging them in this process!<br/>

<br/>
You mean, say okay to every request, no comment even if it may <br/>
conflict with meal or other plans, etc.?  Today my dh requested dd to <br/>
take a rest/quiet-time in our bedroom before her big baseball game, <br/>
since he needs to finish some work in the garage and I have not been <br/>
feeling well and desperately needed a break. They ate lunch (which <br/>
she had a can of grape pop with, no comment/negotiation) then Orion <br/>
asked me for a tootsie pop for dessert.  Since dh wanted her to go to <br/>
bedroom in the next few minutes, I offered her a bag of fruit snacks <br/>
instead, and explained that a popsicle takes a long time to eat, and <br/>
is not allowed in the bedroom.  She protested but then decided to <br/>
have the fruit snacks. <br/>
<br/>
I suppose this was not much of a choice for her, so should I just <br/>
have said okay despite dh&#39;s wishes for the sake of not negotiating <br/>
and allowed food in a room where eating is off limits?  <br/>
<br/>
I can almost hear you ask if something else could have been worked <br/>
out as far as rest-time. Perhaps this is a whole other issue in <br/>
itself, but we were all at a point where some quiet was really <br/>
needed, and the only way for that to happen is if we separate for a <br/>
short time. I have not been forcing naps for several weeks(unless <br/>
younger dd has a meltdown and really needs it). Dh was trying to take <br/>
over for me this afternoon, and made the quiet-time decision (new <br/>
alternative to nap for when everyone gets overwhelmed, <br/>
overstimulated, or when mommy is about to drop over). Another control <br/>
issue...or a sanity issue?  I have been having a difficult time <br/>
seeing clearly, and dh is only going by what I am coming to <br/>
understand about restrictions (both parenting and food related). I <br/>
really didn&#39;t want to question him, nor did I have the energy to give <br/>
up the offer.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
**The fact that she was willing to lie to be able to go eat more <br/>

become to her.  Her desire for those cookies was strong enough to <br/>
undermine the honesty of your relationship.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, this really bothered me!  What have we done to our child?  And <br/>
what should I have done yesterday when she wanted to (almost did) eat <br/>
the ENTIRE box of cookies before dinner?  Said nothing at all?  And <br/>
make no comment when she does not eat a meal?  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
**Dagny and Rowan have never wanted any kind of food badly enough to <br/>
beg for it. I do believe that&#39;s because they have never had to beg <br/>
for any kind of food.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I see now.  But now that we are in this situation, should we <br/>
allow it (popsicles, other foods formerly negotiated for) under any <br/>
circumstance without comment, when they beg for something?<br/>
<br/>
**You can give food magic by doling it out or negotiating for it or <br/>
making it something that they only receive at your whim.  A magic <br/>
that guarantees there can never be *enough* of the forbidden food.**<br/>
<br/>
It seems we have done this. So how do we best handle the transition <br/>
time? I got the suggestion from another list to start by saying yes <br/>
more often, but it almost seems like you are suggesting total <br/>
freedom?  <br/>
<br/>
I so apprecriate all the input.  Please do not take my questions as <br/>
anything other than a need for clarification. I am sure we will not <br/>
get through this without experienced perspective!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>game, <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; since he needs to finish some work in the garage and I have not <br/>
 </span></blockquote>been <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; feeling well and desperately needed a break. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why did she have to go in her room?<br/>
<br/>
They ate lunch (which <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; she had a can of grape pop with, no comment/negotiation) then <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Orion <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; asked me for a tootsie pop for dessert.  Since dh wanted her to go <br/>
 </span></blockquote>to <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; bedroom in the next few minutes, I offered her a bag of fruit <br/>
 </span></blockquote>snacks <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; instead, and explained that a popsicle takes a long time to eat, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; is not allowed in the bedroom.  She protested but then decided to <br/>
&gt; have the fruit snacks. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Short of letting her stay at the table and eat the popsicle, you <br/>
might have sent her in there with the popsicle, a bowl, some paper <br/>
towels and a can of spot shot to clean up anything that might have <br/>
spilled.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I suppose this was not much of a choice for her, so should I just <br/>
&gt; have said okay despite dh&#39;s wishes for the sake of not negotiating <br/>
&gt; and allowed food in a room where eating is off limits?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You and dh need to figure out how to handle that one.  Why is it off <br/>
limits?  Obviously, you and he want to be on the same page so nobody <br/>
feels the other is undermining him/her. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I can almost hear you ask if something else could have been worked <br/>
&gt; out as far as rest-time. Perhaps this is a whole other issue in <br/>
&gt; itself, but we were all at a point where some quiet was really <br/>
&gt; needed, and the only way for that to happen is if we separate for <br/>
 </span></blockquote>a <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; short time. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, you&#39;re right.  hehe.  Why couldn&#39;t you have been separate with <br/>
you in your room, hubby in the garage (I gathered?) and daughter <br/>
wherever she was content - her room, living room, kitchen... etc.<br/>
<br/>
Another control <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; issue...or a sanity issue?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When I am about to drop over, I tell the kids as much.  They can <br/>
hang in their room, or watch tv... or crawl in the bed with me.  <br/>
Whatever they&#39;re feeling like.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Yes, this really bothered me!  What have we done to our child?  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>And <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; what should I have done yesterday when she wanted to (almost did) <br/>
 </span></blockquote>eat <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the ENTIRE box of cookies before dinner?  Said nothing at all?  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>And <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; make no comment when she does not eat a meal?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I say let her eat the whole box.  A couple times of that and there&#39;s <br/>
a good chance:<br/>
<br/>
1.The magic will be gone as the taboo has been lifted. <br/>
<br/>
2.She&#39;ll likely realize all on her own that maybe a whole box of <br/>
cookies at one sitting doesn&#39;t really agree with a person most often.<br/>
<br/>
I seriously doubt she&#39;ll end up eating entire boxes of cookies on a <br/>
regular basis.  How long has she been standing on the other side of <br/>
an imaginary wall eyeing the &quot;buffet&quot; with all those tasty things <br/>
she couldn&#39;t have or was able just to have enough to whet her <br/>
appetite - or that she had to wheel and deal and bargain for?<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, someone has torn down the wall and like any starving <br/>
person she&#39;s moved to go nuts.  Once she gets her fill and realizes <br/>
the barrier isn&#39;t going back up, and that she&#39;ll be able to help <br/>
herself to whatever is on the buffet whenever she&#39;s feeling the <br/>
need, the binging will pass.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes, I see now.  But now that we are in this situation, should we <br/>
&gt; allow it (popsicles, other foods formerly negotiated for) under <br/>
 </span></blockquote>any <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; circumstance without comment, when they beg for something?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, I really say yes.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It seems we have done this. So how do we best handle the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>transition <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; time? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ride it out.  :)  And do have healthy stuff at hand as well.  Not <br/>
things that are hard for the kids to just grab or that need prep.  <br/>
My kids love having a veggie platter in the fridge... chopped up <br/>
veggies and a dish of ranch dressing... sliced cheese on a plate <br/>
covered in plastic in the fridge... and some crackers... think of <br/>
things that are easy to grab.  I even eat &quot;junk&quot; if I&#39;m not feeling <br/>
like prepping something - even if I&#39;m craving something healthy.  <br/>
tsk.  :)<br/>
I got the suggestion from another list to start by saying yes <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; more often, but it almost seems like you are suggesting total <br/>
&gt; freedom?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I believe that is exactly what we&#39;re suggesting.  Well I can&#39;t speak <br/>
for all... but I suggest it.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I so apprecriate all the input.  Please do not take my questions <br/>
 </span></blockquote>as <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; anything other than a need for clarification.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not at all!  I&#39;m still full of questions myself and learning all the <br/>
time.  The more I learn, the more I realize how little I know.  <br/>
lol.  I hope you find some helpful answers here.<br/>

 class="ygrps-yiv-978068478660481100-02062004">I heard something funny on the radio this 
morning....one of the djs was talking about his nephew who is now 19.&nbsp; He 
said up until the age of 4 he ate almost anything.&nbsp; Then, when he was 4 he 
had some problems and they thought he had some severe food allergies.&nbsp; 
Somehow he got it into his little head that he could only eat cheetos, peanut 
butter, McDonald&#39;s french fries and milk safely.&nbsp; That&#39;s what he lived on 
for the next 15 years!&nbsp; No joke.&nbsp; He said he even tried to bribe him 
at the age of 10 to eat a slice of pizza for 20 dollars, and the kid refused. 
The pediatrician said not to worry about it, just give him vitamins daily.&nbsp; 
The kid is now 6&#39;3&quot; and healthy, and is totally into computers and is pretty 
smart.&nbsp; How weird is that???&nbsp; Not exactly the healthy diet, but still 
turned out ok.&nbsp; We have always been told in school (thru my education and 
nursing classes) that children will not let themselves starve....if they get 
hungry enough, they will eat, even if it isn&#39;t as good for them as we had 
hoped.&nbsp; Yes, we need to help them know what better choices are, but we have 
to be very careful in this society.&nbsp; Too much emphasis is placed on food 
and size.&nbsp; There would be less kids with eating disorders (and adults, too) 
if we didn&#39;t put so much pressure on everyone to eat this or only be this 
size.&nbsp; We need to start changing the way people think by starting with our 
kids.&nbsp; Unless your child becomes sick, don&#39;t pressure them too much.&nbsp; 
They will come around.&nbsp; I know I sometimes get stressed about how much junk 
Cae is eating (even though she eats most anything), but I really try hard not to 
make too big a deal over it....I want her to be healthy, no matter what she eats 
and what her size, and as kids they can be, even if they eat lots of things we 
view as unhealthy.&nbsp; Just have lots of &quot;good&quot; snacks available to them and 
encourage them to try things at least once every 6-9 months (their tastes can 
change quickly) (we call it the &quot;no thank you bite&quot;).&nbsp; They&#39;ll 
learn.</span></font></em></div>

<br/>
I have to say that it does sound like you have a lot of junk food in <br/>
the house - more than what we typically have. And I especially agree <br/>
that kids will almost always choose the &quot;easiest&quot; thing, whether it is <br/>
an apple or a piece of candy.<br/>
<br/>
Since you have set a precedent of being SO controlling, you might have <br/>
to spend months &quot;acting&quot; like the food she chooses is just totally fine <br/>
with you.<br/>
<br/>
BUT - maybe put that energy that you have used in watching her food <br/>
intake like a hawk into making all kinds of relatively healthy creative <br/>
good snack foods. If it would help, we could give you some ideas here.<br/>
<br/>
Which reminds me, it may be that she doesn&#39;t eat at mealtime as much - <br/>
but remember that&#39;s okay, too. Snacking/grazing is healthier.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some ideas for stocking up on healthier snack foods:<br/>
<br/>
Fruit is ALWAYS tastier when somebody else has sliced it up for us. <br/>
Spend the extra money to get really tasty good fruit - don&#39;t just get <br/>
it at the regular grocery store. Have cantaloupe, honeydew, and <br/>
watermelon chunks available in the fridge in small baggies so the kids <br/>
can grab one on the go.<br/>
Try putting a little cinnamon on apple slices - have them cold or, in <br/>
the evenings, heat them in the microwave.<br/>
Celery sticks with cream cheese and raisins is called &quot;ants on a log.&quot;<br/>
Peanut butter balls (dried milk, honey, peanut butter, raisins) We like <br/>
these frozen.<br/>
Trail mix - again, have it available in little baggies so they can grab <br/>
it quickly.<br/>
Mini boxes of raisins.<br/>
Cute little cheeses.<br/>
Pudding - store bought or make your own.<br/>
Custard in little cups.<br/>
Peanuts in shells!<br/>
<br/>
And then there are all the great frozen treats:<br/>
chunks of banana dipped in melted chocolate or caramel and rolled in <br/>
coconut - this is just SO good - thin the chocolate or caramel so it is <br/>
just a thin coating.<br/>
<br/>
juice frozen in ice cube trays<br/>
<br/>
and our all-time most favorite never-get-tired-of-it treat is FROZEN <br/>
GRAPES!!!!  These are BETTER than candy!<br/>

<br/>
Thanks, Alyce...  <br/>
Since lifting imposed naptime several weeks ago (because she has <br/>
reached a point where she obviously doesn&#39;t need one, and because we <br/>
are changing our parenting views) we have tried many different <br/>
scenarios.  If Ava (younger dd) needs a nap, Ava goes to the kids&#39; <br/>
bedroom.  If I need quiet time or a nap on the couch (which is more <br/>
and more often, as I am 8 months pregnant) we have been trying to <br/>
give Orion the choice of a chilling out in the living room chair with <br/>
a quiet activity, reading books, watching a movie at low volume, etc. <br/>
but she has not been able to remain quiet enough to let me rest (I <br/>
have always been sensitive to noise and it has increased during this <br/>
pregnancy).  She simply cannot sit or keep her voice low for any <br/>
length of time -- she is a mover and constantly talks or sings to <br/>
herself, and cannot resist initiating conversation.  So if my need is <br/>
great and dh is not occuppying our bedroom, a few times we have asked <br/>
her to go there for a short time with some books and toys, while I <br/>
lay on the couch. I do not feel comfortable leaving her alone in the <br/>
rest of the house while I rest in the bed (too many possibilities for <br/>
a 5yo).<br/>
<br/>
Sigh.  I guess this &#39;other issue&#39; is really about conflict of needs <br/>
and how to go about solving these kind of conflicts in a way where <br/>
everyone feels respected, and satisfied.  I don&#39;t want to force my <br/>
kids to do anything anymore, but coming to that place is really <br/>
taking effort and much more creativity/abilty than it seems we have <br/>
at times!  We have been so accustomed to reacting without thought, to <br/>
looking without seeing, to making decisions instead of offering <br/>
choices, that it is like we are almost deaf and dumb!<br/>
<br/>
How great that there is a place to come to, &#39;put it out there&#39;. To <br/>
have someone listen who doesn&#39;t even know you, and care enough to try <br/>
and help is awesome.  <br/>

<br/>
Perhaps it sounds that way from my posts, but we really don&#39;t usually <br/>
have much junk in the house, on purpose.  My mother has always <br/>
berated me for depriving the kids because of this fact (Funny, <br/>
because my mother has a negative weight/food issue)!  It may have <br/>
come across as so because, like I said, we decided to relax the food <br/>
issue over a holiday weekend, then visited my parents&#39; where there <br/>
was constant access to junk/sweets.  We allowed the kids to bring <br/>
home &#39;treats&#39; offered by family (why do they always try to force us <br/>
to take home all the junk?) which we rarely do.  Also, before the <br/>
weekend, I allowed the girls to &#39;purchase&#39; toostie pops and ice cream <br/>
at the store (without thinking about the holiday coming up) because <br/>
we have been out of easter candy for awhile.  I have always tried to <br/>
provide fun, healthier snacks at home (although some you mentioned <br/>
were new)as well as fruit, etc.  My mother has always said my kids <br/>
beg for treats because they don&#39;t EVER get them at home (not entirely <br/>
true -- we have allowed treats in moderation, and this has meant not <br/>
keeping the house stocked at all times).  This (moderation) doesn&#39;t <br/>
seem all that restrictive to me.  I think perhaps I have been too <br/>
restrictive about how much, and when to eat when opportunities are <br/>
available?   <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Since you have set a precedent of being SO controlling, you might <br/>

This makes me a little sad.  Not because you said it, but because I <br/>
did not realize that I was as controlling as is becoming apparent.  I <br/>
always thought I was doing the best for them.  I have always <br/>
considered myself a deeply committed, highly involved/aware, but not <br/>
overbearing or smothering parent (I know some of those!).  Then Orion <br/>
turned 4yo and everything started to come undone.  Everything I <br/>
thought I was doing out of love started to fail, and I started to <br/>

Eight months pregnant is a very tired place to be.  And I&#39;m hoping <br/>
someone else will jump in here with other ideas!  :)  But I&#39;ll give <br/>
it a whack.  First, I don&#39;t know your husband&#39;s work or sleep <br/>
schedule, or yours for that matter, so if I present something that <br/>
is completely impossible, I apologize.<br/>
<br/>
You said that when your dh isn&#39;t occupying the bedroom you sometimes <br/>
have her go in there to rest/have quiet time.  When he IS in there, <br/>
can she go in and hang out with him while you rest or no?  When he&#39;s <br/>
not occupying the bedroom, is he elsewhere on the premises where she <br/>
could go be with him while you rest?  Do you have a trusted teen in <br/>
the neighborhood who would be willing to come over for a little bit <br/>
sometimes and entertain her while you rest?  A neighbor?  Friend?  I <br/>
was lucky enough to have a neigbor who came over to help me out when <br/>
my son was an infant - I had the two girls as well... I didn&#39;t have <br/>
to pay her... We had her over for dinner or traded other favors like <br/>
running her to the store (she didn&#39;t drive.)  So maybe there&#39;s <br/>
someone who might be willing to help when your dh can&#39;t be there?<br/>
<br/>
  We have been so accustomed to reacting without thought, to <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; looking without seeing, to making decisions instead of offering <br/>
&gt; choices, that it is like we are almost deaf and dumb!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know.  Like I said - been there!  *shudder*  But it sounds like <br/>
you&#39;re definitely on the right track now!  And once you get over the <br/>
initial rough spots, it WILL come easier and you should all enjoy <br/>
each other even more.  <br/>
<br/>
Now if the next speaker will please jump in with some awesome input, <br/>
we&#39;d appreciate it!  :)<br/>

<br/>
No, he works night shift and is usually sleeping during the day.  <br/>
Sometimes I feel like putting her in there even when he is sleeping <br/>
and locking the door!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;When he&#39;s not occupying the bedroom, is he elsewhere on the premises <br/>
 </span></blockquote>where she could go be with him while you rest?  <br/>
<br/>
Our house is very, very small, but on rare days, if an opportunity <br/>
arises he will occupy kids in livingroom or take them outside!  Today <br/>
he took the girls out in the yard for awhile, but had to finish a <br/>
side job in the garage before I felt ready to get up (rough day).  <br/>
Hence he took her to bedroom and read her a book, gave her a few to <br/>
read on her own, and some stuffed animals.  She made noise in there <br/>
awhile (muffled), but when I got up and peeked in, she was asleep.  <br/>
More peaceful than having her downstairs asking her to be quieter <br/>
every few minutes, and having us both end up frustrated, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Do you have a trusted teen in the neighborhood who would be willing <br/>

<br/>
I just interviewed a teenage girl who has been advertising for <br/>
babysitting. She came over once for a few hours, but cannot start <br/>
coming on a regular basis during the day until next week.  I think it <br/>
will really help us all.  This is a big step, as we have never had <br/>
anyone other than family watch the girls (somehow, after we had 2 <br/>
kids, family is not so willing to offer help).<br/>
<br/>

I really want to believe that, so I am going to trust...and carry on.<br/>

<div>The wonderful thing is that you are starting to understand this NOW.</div>

<div>Most parents start when the child is 13 or so! By the time they have a 
handle on it (and many NEVER do), the child has completely rebelled and there&#39;s 
that parent/teen struggle that becomes inevitable. It&#39;s full-blown by then, and 
the family can&#39;t recover in time before the child is out of&nbsp;the

<div id="ygrps-yiv-399170583">Hi there<br/>
I read in one of your posts that you are a light sleeper? That any <br/>
noise is bound to disturb your rest? I am the same way. Rarely I do <br/>
not have to get up to drive my husband to town, and when I don&#39;t have <br/>
to I like to sleep in another hour or so, but the sounds of him <br/>
getting ready can disturb me to the point of not being able to rest <br/>
more. So I got a pair of ear plugs, it doesn&#39;t block out all the <br/>
sound but dulls it so it isn&#39;t so invasive. Maybe you could get a <br/>
pair for when you nap and your husband is around to be available to <br/>
your daughter.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is almost nine and gets herself breakfast, feeds the <br/>
cats, wathces her shows, colours etc. So I know she is fine even when <br/>
I block out sound.<br/>
