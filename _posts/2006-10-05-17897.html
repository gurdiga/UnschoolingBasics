You really need to research your state laws because typicaly the<br/>
portfolio review can be done by ANY certified teacher whether they&#39;re<br/>
actively teaching or not (certificate just needs to be up to date).<br/>
<br/>
Please be aware that when you ask questions about what the law says,<br/>
you&#39;re talking to over 1,100 people from all over the world. We can&#39;t<br/>
possibly know how to help if you don&#39;t give details.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-81041648">I do unschool and feel that I teach my children every day I have no set agenda like math science and such but do teach them I am sorry that you don&#39;t feel that you &quot;teach &quot; your children because the parent is the #1 influence in the child&#39;s life I am a stay at home mother and feel that I do &quot;teach &quot; my children I do not use books and such if that is what you mean by &quot;teach&quot; please do not judge as I do not judge you as I do not even know you. And as for the teacher I just wanted to know how to find one to look at my daughter&#39;s work as I don&#39;t know where to begin looking for one. Sorry but maybe this group isn&#39;t for me as I have had no real help with my version of unschooling which I feel is going well I am teaching my children life skills that they need to know when they grow up I also let them be children and learn what they are interested in but also enforce rules and boundries which maybe to you something you need to learn.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is a national/international list - we don&#39;t know what the legal <br/>
requirements are where you are (is teacher evaluation even legally <br/>
required or can it just be a narrative you write or whatever - it <br/>
varies by state/province/country). Your best bet is to look for <br/>
either a yahoo group for your state/province/country or <br/>
google &quot;homeschool&quot; and your state to find state/local support <br/>
groups. IF a teacher/evaluator is necessary, they&#39;d be the ones who <br/>
know which ones are unschooling friendly and which want to see <br/>
workbook pages and so on.<br/>
<br/>
And, too, any &quot;subject area requirements&quot; would be local to you <br/>
(state/province/country) not a global that we all have to abide by, <br/>
so again, a local/state group would be of more help (or at least <br/>
check nhen.org for a summary for your state). &quot;what is expected of <br/>
children to learn&quot; as far as the state laws go, you&#39;ll have to tell <br/>
us where you are or go look up the laws because as unschoolers we <br/>
-don&#39;t- have any &quot;should know&quot; stuff that we require of our kids. <br/>
Those who do have reporting/recordkeeping laws to abide by generally <br/>
just make notes of what they -do- and then translate that <br/>
into &quot;educationese&quot; when they need to report anything. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;but also enforce rules and boundries which maybe to you something <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Most of us have family principles and strive to live in such a way <br/>
that all members of the family are treated with respect rather than <br/>
parentally determined rules and enforcement.<br/>
