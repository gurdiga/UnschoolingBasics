Karen I  was thinking about answering you but was catching up on 200 <br/>
e-mails and  thought for sure someone helped you I am going to get <br/>
kids ready for bed  and then I will write longer.<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there and get a hug from  somebody.<br/>

 <br/>
Thanks, Julie. I see there are a good many replies and I hope to have the  <br/>
time to absorb them - if not, I&#39;ll wait til I can. <br/>

Karen,  I&#39;m so sorry your post got lost in the all the conversation.<br/>
<br/>
This stuff  is HARD. You made a really hard decision  to ask your  daughter <br/>
to  <br/>
leave, NOT because you don&#39;t love her or want her, but because you   had to <br/>
protect the whole family. I&#39;m sure she&#39;s angry. Hopefully her  grandmother  <br/>
will <br/>
care for her without buying into her anger. Stay in  touch with her. Call  <br/>
her <br/>
every day, even if she won&#39;t talk to you.  Not to process or discuss her  <br/>
issues, but just checking in.  Encourage the other kids to stay in touch with <br/>
her  <br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
Good  luck:)<br/>
Kathryn<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am not calling, but am emailing or text messaging very often. I always  <br/>
tell her I love her, and I do my best to convey love and strength, kwim? It&#39;s so  <br/>
hard. <br/>
 <br/>
Yes, how I chose to show my love to her and the family as a until has ben a  <br/>
hard and bitter pill fr me to swallow...I just never thought I&#39;d do that..ever <br/>
 feel I had no other options...<br/>
 <br/>
Thank you for your support, Kathryn. I&#39;m glad I risked posting again. <br/>
 <br/>
Karen <br/>
