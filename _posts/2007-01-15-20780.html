Sierra joined but has been playing more on Dragonblight with her<br/>
cousin than on Venture Co. It&#39;s so nice that you all created this,<br/>
what a fun place for unschoolers to hang out!:) Sierra said they were<br/>
all dancing one night and it was sorta like &quot;being at the conference&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
We stood in line at midnight to pick up our expansion packs....I&#39;m<br/>
soooo tired today because I needed to get up early for work. It was<br/>
worth it to see the joy on their faces when the cashier handed it all<br/>
over. I know what&#39;s going on at MY house today!:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1205512711">Sounds like our house Ren.  We got in line at 12:00 didn&#39;t get  our game and <br/>
stratedgy guide till 1 AM got home and realized that WONDERFUL  Vista wont <br/>
allow me to install BC onto my computer because of how it writes to  the hard <br/>
drive and Vista isnt having  or liking it.  So i had to  uninstall Vista <br/>
reintstall XP (which took 3 hours since Vista damaged the  partitions in my computer <br/>
that are supposed to be protected) then had to  reinstall everything.  Anyone <br/>
who is thinking of getting Vista DONT.   You&#39;ll want to throw your computer out <br/>
the window.<br/>

&quot; Work like you don&#39;t need the money, love like you&#39;ve  never been hurt, and <br/>
dance like you do when nobody&#39;s watching.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;All that  is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good people  do<br/>
nothing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot; Knowledge is power but how you use that power defines  wether you are good <br/>
or evil.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m Markus (13 yrs) and I would like to join the guild. I should have<br/>
BC this week. Is there a link to a guild website for more info on the<br/>
guild? Are we all going to be Blood Elves or can we choose any horde race?<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to playing with all of you!<br/>
<br/>

I had pre-ordered the expansion pack last May from Amazon, but we just <br/>
got back from Best Buy and picked it up there (they had plenty in <br/>
stock, so I guess the demand varies in different areas?).   The order <br/>
from Amazon is being prepared for shipping, so I can&#39;t cancel it and <br/>
will have to return it, but I didn&#39;t want to take the chance that we <br/>
couldn&#39;t get our hands on one today.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s being installed as I&#39;m writing this!    <br/>
