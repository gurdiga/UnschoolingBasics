<div id="ygrps-yiv-1469335462">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Another quick question.  How have folks dealt with guilt once you realized that you have gotten trapped in conventional parenting techniques and realized that you needed to change your ways?  I realize it is probably a process and doesn&#39;t happen over night.  But, often I get stuck in guilt mode of realizing all the parenting mistakes I have made and the related damage.  Has anyone, found unschooling to be healing for themselves and their children?  Has it helped heal your relationship(s)?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1196301168">Amy , I&#39;m still dealing with quilt... I begin to wash that feeling away  but than I slip into &#39;old&#39; parenting style and than the quilt process starts all over...  I think that we just have to keep learning to forgive ourselves and soon we can let it go.  yesterday I was talking to my oldest whose now 7 and I asked him if he remembers when I use to spank or time out too much -- he said no ... so sometimes I think we worry too much about that!!  granted I want to continue towards a even more peaceful home front but I  think that any damage I may have done in past I am healing...  One of the biggest things I know that my children respond to well -- is when I openly apologize .<br/>

It&#39;s nice to know that unschooling has helped your relationships with your kids.  It gives me hope for the future:-)  I&#39;ve had one situations with my youngest yesterday and one with my oldest today that I know reading the e-mails on this list helped me handle better than I would have in the past!  (Not perfectly, but better.)<br/>

      Unschooling has definitely been healing for my relationships with my kids...incredibly so.  It&#39;s taken time, but I feel now that my relationship with my daughter is pretty much where it would have been if we&#39;d been on this path all along, and in some regards better, both because we&#39;ve got the memories for contrast, and also because the changes have given us the opportunity to make amends, heal old hurts, and examine our relationship.   we are 2 years out now, on this path, and it&#39;s just the last few month things really feel qualitatively different.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>***Letting go of guilt is one of the biggest gifts I have given my children.<br/>
Instead of feeling guilty and depressed, I have used each mistake as a<br/>
learning-take (thanks you Ms. Lovejoy). I become a little more analytical<br/>
about what is going on and less emotional. Feeling bad that I hurt my kids<br/>
is not helping them. realizing what the mistake was, correcting it and<br/>
moving on is huge!<br/>
<br/>
I was an attachment parent and we have always unschooled. However there were<br/>
several things that I was doing that wasn&#39;t the healthiest thing for our<br/>
family. The Radical part of unschooling really helped me shift. I was not<br/>
being my child&#39;s best parent. Anytime I can figure out how to be better I am<br/>
helping my children and our relationship. I just keep digging deeper. It can<br/>
be really painful. I have to admit that XYZ hurt me and that I am hurting my<br/>
child. It is like double pain. BUT so worth it.<br/>
<br/>
This parenting path, including unschooling, has been the main source of my<br/>
healing from childhood abuse. It has been an amazing road of discovery and<br/>
growth. For my kids and me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I find guilt to be a bit helpful, actually. Not to wallow in, though. Just to pay attention to and to realize that I&#39;ve got a disconnect between how I want things to be and what I&#39;m actually doing. It&#39;s my wake-up call and provides a great incentive for change (for me).<br/>
<br/>
If I end up wallowing in guilt, however, and can&#39;t move forward because I&#39;m stuck in &quot;if only&quot; land, then it&#39;s time for me to sort out how to move on. When I do the wallow thing, I become sad and I mourn what-could-have-been... but then I miss out on the what-is-now and all the associated opportunities.<br/>
<br/>
IMO, guilt is fine as long as it helps us shift and then we let it go.</div>
