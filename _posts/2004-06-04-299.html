<div id="ygrps-yiv-225344141">I wonder if others are confused by this as well. For instance, Helen&#39;s line <br/>
of not approving of charterhsing is not reflected in the advertising on the <br/>
website she has up. I guess whatever pays the rent . . .<br/>
<br/>
But are unschoolers and other hsers looking at a mag expecting to see <br/>
products in keeping with the editorial positions and philosophies espoused by the <br/>
publication?<br/>
<br/>
If you read an unschooling mag, what are you looking for? I don&#39;t sub to any <br/>
of the ed mags so I wonder what it is parents are expecting to get out of <br/>
them, as far as poducts. Are they helpful? Am I missing out on some great <br/>
resources? Or are the products inconsistent with what you would expect?<br/>

I guess I was naive.<br/>
I assumed there was atleast a little support behind the people you <br/>
let advertise in your magazine.<br/>
Wow.<br/>
I actually looked through your magazine when my dd said she wanted <br/>
to try high school and thought it was a good resource to go to, to <br/>
find programs that might help her.<br/>
