<div id="ygrps-yiv-1910562384">I told you all about the &quot;links&quot; section and forgot about the &quot;photos&quot; <br/>
section. A few families (including mine) have uploaded pics to <br/>
share...anyone is welcome to add their photos, it&#39;s nice to have a <br/>
face with the posts.<br/>
<br/>
I just added a few from the conference (and the tattoo that I got with <br/>
Rue&#39;s Jon) and noticed a couple pics I hadn&#39;t seen before. It&#39;s still <br/>
pretty empty though! So share some photos of your sweet children (and <br/>
yourself).<br/>

you looked like ... reddish-brown hair, long and sort of <br/>
curly/frizzy and wild, and always dressed in bohemian-type long, <br/>
swirly skirtsskirts. It was such a distinct picture that I sometimes <br/>
forgot I didn&#39;t really know what you did look like. HA! Was I off!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1562769591">I teach college English on-line, and I always have a mental picture  <br/>
of my students. When I happen to meet one, I am always way off! Last  <br/>
semester, I met with a student that I had been assuming was straight  <br/>
out of high school. A good writer, but something about her name and  <br/>
things she had said made me think she was very young. Was I surprised  <br/>
when a 45-year-old woman showed up to our meeting!<br/>
<br/>
This semester, I had an excellent student, a forceful and eloquent  <br/>
writer. I teach argumentative writing, and she had no trouble taking  <br/>
a stand. One of my few students who has earned a pure 4.0 on the  <br/>
basis of her writing. She dropped by my office to pick up her final  <br/>
portfolio, and she was this slender wisp of a thing--98 pounds  <br/>
dripping wet--with a voice that sounded like she&#39;d been inhaling  <br/>
helium. I commented on what a good writer she was, and she said, &quot;oh,  <br/>
um, huh, do you really think so &lt;giggle&gt;, I guess so.&quot; Never met my  <br/>
eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Su<br/>
<br/>
p.s. The community college students I teach every semester are reason  <br/>
number 1427 why we homeschool. I see the product of the public  <br/>
schools every day! Also, the way the occasional homeschooled student  <br/>
stands out. I have rarely had a weak writer among homeschooled  <br/>
students, though I have had a couple who seemed to lack a broad  <br/>
perspective, like the one who wrote an argument about homeschooling  <br/>
that assumed homeschooling meant following a curriculum, mailing work  <br/>
off to a teacher who graded it and sent it back, and so on. But the  <br/>
public school students also tend to have huge gaps, and combine them  <br/>
with very weak skills as well. I had a publicly-schooled student once  <br/>
who had never heard of the Civil War. I thought she was putting me on  <br/>
(&quot;Wait,&quot; she said. &quot;There was a war here?&quot;) but she wasn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s always interesting to get an argument about homeschooling. One  <br/>
of my students wrote an argument this semester about Michigan needing  <br/>
tighter regulation of homeschoolers (we live in Michigan). When they  <br/>
write about something I know a lot about and have a strong opinion  <br/>
about, I have to carefully step back not to rip their argument to  <br/>
shreds but to judge it by the standards of a freshman writing class.<br/>
<br/>
Am I off-topic enough yet? Or should I try harder &lt;smile&gt;?<br/>
<br/>
I taught a face-to-face class this semester for the first time in  <br/>
years. I had forgotten how passively they sit there, how little  <br/>
effort they make to meet me halfway, how completely they expect to be  <br/>
entertained and educated with little or no effort on their part. It  <br/>
can be like doing a comedy routine to a hostile audience; very  <br/>
draining. And the younger ones don&#39;t realize they are making a choice  <br/>
to be in college, so they continue to behave like they&#39;re under  <br/>
compulsion. They won&#39;t do any assignment that is worth less than 10%  <br/>
of their final grade because they think it won&#39;t matter. I can&#39;t tell  <br/>
you how many times this semester I showed up to teach a 4-hour course  <br/>
(a once-a-week evening class) to find that maybe 2 of them had done  <br/>
the prep work I requested, so that we weren&#39;t able to do what I had  <br/>
planned and I had to improvise for four hours! If I ask them to do in- <br/>
class work, they dash off something inadequate in five minutes so  <br/>
they can go home.<br/>
<br/>
I like my students as people. As students, not so much. And I tend to  <br/>
think the problem is created by being put into the role of &quot;student.&quot;  <br/>
But I&#39;m preaching to the choir here, and will shut up.<br/>

I&#39;m glad you wrote it all out!  I copied it and sent it to my  DH.<br/>
 <br/>
People challenge us continually of why we homeschool, I love hearing from  <br/>
someone who is out there meeting &quot;properly&quot; graduated teens and knowing it is  <br/>
far below what we imagine it to be.  The opposite of a success story, I  <br/>
suppose.<br/>

Hello, from  another unschooling mom who was a schoolteacher in her pre-<br/>
kid  life.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
lol... does it count being an &quot;almost&quot; teacher?? I dropped out of the  <br/>
teaching program a year before I would&#39;ve finished it, and graduated that spring  <br/>
instead. The state decided to make this new test that students now HAVE to pass  <br/>
to graduate, and I just opposed it to no end and refused to teach under those <br/>
 circumstances.  <br/>
