<div id="ygrps-yiv-557777952">Don&#39;t really know how to word this, but have any of you had periods of<br/>
time where you feel like you really are not doing much of anything. I<br/>
don&#39;t mean that&quot; not doing much educational&quot; feeling. Just kind of a<br/>
stuck, sluggish blaaah kind of feeling.<br/>
<br/>
We just got through about a year of medical testing for our second<br/>
son. He was not growing, not eating, getting depressed and having abd.<br/>
pain. I thought celiac, those tests came back negative, so we moved on<br/>
to Cystic fibrosis tests, SDS tests, Crohns disease, you name it, he<br/>
was tested. <br/>
<br/>
To cut a long story short, after nearly a year, and finding that his<br/>
bone density is low, and a severely broken arm, we decided to start<br/>
gluten free. In two weeks his weight started to go up rapidly, his<br/>
mood improved. So his diagnosis is celiac.<br/>
<br/>
So I don&#39;t know if I could be having some depression after such a<br/>
worrying year. Life is very different when it all gears around the<br/>
next set of medical tests.And I am having difficulty now getting into<br/>
a more normal kind of life.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas? How to get back to enjoying life, getting back a lighter<br/>
spirit and enjoying doing fun things with the children?<br/>

It sounds like you are having a normal reaction to a very stressful time in<br/>
your life. Whenever we (people in general) are very busy and &quot;activated&quot;<br/>
with things in our life...stressful scary things like your son&#39;s illness and<br/>
medical problems but also happy stress like having babies and moving and fun<br/>
big things then there is a period of let down...anti climax as you will.<br/>
Just continue to learn about your son&#39;s needs and go outside and<br/>
play...spring and summer are the best times of year in my opinion and give<br/>
your self time to relax and enjoy this moment.<br/>
Yes we all have those blah feelings where it seems like --(I do anyway)-<br/>
where it seems I can&#39;t rub two ideas together and accomplish anything.<br/>
Clean your house or a closet..get a sitter or leave the kids with daddy and<br/>
go do something for you...sometimes we (homeschoolers especially)<br/>
(attachment parents also) seem to focus so much on our children that we can<br/>
forget to have some &quot;healthy selfishness&quot;.<br/>
I find that when I feel a little down that a good break away from kids and<br/>
house are all I need to find my center again. I am only just learning this.<br/>
I also like the freshness of a complete spring cleaning...as I am a person<br/>
who thinks clearer in clear uncluttered environments. :)<br/>
Hang in there momma :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve had big chunks of time like you describe. In fact, I&#39;m just at the time<br/>
where I&#39;m feeling the nigglings of needing to get up and *move* and do<br/>
*something* -- Spring Fever? I&#39;ll use it to my advantage :D<br/>
There&#39;s a sign I pass daily, lately it says, &quot;Action is the antidote to<br/>
despair&quot; So I&#39;ve been carrying that around with me lately. When I get that<br/>
&quot;Grey Cloud&quot; feeling, I move; even just across the room or outside into the<br/>
fresh air for a moment. It&#39;s helped immensely!<br/>
Another biggie: Look around you, find Gratitude in your *right now* - how<br/>
blessed you are to have a moment to do nothing but soak in the gift of this<br/>
very moment. That tends to connect me back to where/who I want to be.<br/>
<br/>
sometimes we (homeschoolers especially)<br/>

possible for you to reconnect right in the middle of the chaos (a lovely<br/>
visual I carry &quot;every hurricane has a calm center&quot;). Though I truly believe<br/>
&quot;When mama ain&#39;t happy, ain&#39;t nobody happy&quot; I truly believe, equally, that<br/>
every mama can find her happy right where she is, right in that moment and<br/>
create *connection* instead of separation... Breathe deep (in someone&#39;s<br/>
hair) and often, feel the sun on your face, inspire laughter, dance, sing,<br/>
create, plant, walk, run, paint; all of those can be done with company :)<br/>
with happy company, even.<br/>
My blog has pictures  of my recent planting projects and our battle with<br/>
inertia, last weekend :)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a big one for me. I battled extreme depression for a long <br/>
time. I saw numerous therapists who all focused on my problems and <br/>
relationships and I got nowhere. Finally, I lucked on a LCSW who <br/>
taught me how to change my negative thoughts to positive ones. It <br/>
wasn&#39;t about denying my feelings or lying to myself. It was about <br/>
acknowledging all the good things in my life. I started out very <br/>
basic. I had food and shelter. I had clothing. I had a job. I had a <br/>
family. As I got better at it I started to see all the other good <br/>
things I had/have. Now I do it automatically and it really does <br/>
work. All I have to do to change my mood is change my thinking.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with this, too. I think it&#39;s even more important to be able <br/>
to do this than to get away. What happens if it&#39;s just impossible to <br/>
get away even for a short time? Do you then have to stay stuck in <br/>
the negativity until you can get away? I prefer to find a way out of <br/>
the negativity here and now in the moment rather than waiting for <br/>
some magical alone time. <br/>
<br/>
My husband was deployed for a year. I was pregnant and had a 3yo who <br/>
would not stay with anyone else to care for. I also had a teenager <br/>
who kept very different hours from the 3yo. I had my baby halfway <br/>
through my dh&#39;s deployment so then I had a breastfeeding newborn to <br/>
take care of as well. There was no way I was going to get away. I <br/>
had to find that place in my mind in the middle of the chaos. That <br/>
was my only option.<br/>
