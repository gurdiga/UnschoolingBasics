<div id="ygrps-yiv-1704633238">Any advice please!<br/>
My 11yo son loves water play, but in the summer he gets WAY out of<br/>
control with this. We have a baby and a 3.5yo so an outdoor pool is<br/>
not a possibility for drowning safety,and I can see he has a lot of<br/>
fun with water but he turns on the garden hose all the time and soaks<br/>
himself, and makes the garden like a mud bog. We are in town with a<br/>
small lot so there is no room for a designated wet area. Every year<br/>
this is an issue, we will be dressed to go somewhere, turn round and<br/>
him and all the other children (9,5,4yo) are soaked and shivering,<br/>
shoes wet and all.<br/>
How do I let him have his fun without such an incredible mess, extra<br/>
wet muddy laundry and saturated grass swamp?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-989701038">My kids love water too. We do swim team that means we are at the pool <br/>
in the summer for about three to four hours a day. Different practice <br/>
times and schedules. In the evening after practice they want to... you <br/>
guessed it go swimming. <br/>
<br/>
I say help your boys find a way to enjoy the water!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have a waterbaby, we dipped him in the Hudson when<br/>
he was two months old, water is his life. He&#39;s 14 now<br/>
and  still loves to play with the hose. It&#39;s the way<br/>
they are and there isn&#39;t much you can do about it. I<br/>
know, I&#39;m one and at 51 I still make mischief with the<br/>
hose on a regular basis :) We have always had an<br/>
aboveground pool and I have honestly never understood<br/>
what people worry about but when they were little we<br/>
also had a big blow up one (10&#39; X 6&#39; X 18&quot;?) they&#39;re<br/>
around $40 and worth every penny. They spent many<br/>
hours playing in it, with the hose, toys, the bigger<br/>
Little Tyke slide can fit over the walls so they can<br/>
slide in.  But the real life saver is indoor outdoor<br/>
carpet. Buy a big piece and put it down. Let them play<br/>
on that, it keeps the mud down and gives them a safe<br/>
place to play. Make it the designated wet place, if<br/>
he&#39;s already playing with the hose and making a muddy<br/>
place then you do have space for some thing, it&#39;s<br/>
really a question of devoting the space. Honest, it&#39;s<br/>
worth it not to have to deal with the mud. I can&#39;t<br/>
help you with an answer to getting him to not do it<br/>
when you are headed out. I don&#39;t know if this would<br/>
help but we instituted a rule when they were really<br/>
little about only running through puddles when we were<br/>
on the way home. We always kept track of the good<br/>
looking ones and made sure we went back to them. Maybe<br/>
you could make a deal with him to wait until you got<br/>
home. I&#39;m sure he doesn&#39;t really like going out<br/>
dripping wet. Oh, and there are some great heads out<br/>
there that produce a great spray without a lot of<br/>
water and force, which can hurt the little ones.<br/>
Goggles and water shoes make safer fun too. And just<br/>
dressing in their bathing suits, that&#39;s a huge laundry<br/>
saver! We go days here in th summer with just suits<br/>
on. Good luck--ELISA<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-894562339">Could you do an inflatable pool that he can play in ( in his swim <br/>
trunks ) and let him know that it&#39;s okay to play in the pool, but not <br/>
in his nice going out clothes, and not to get his siblings wet if they <br/>
are fully dressed??? I&#39;m not really sure but this is what i was <br/>
thinking about for a pool. <br/>

like that, not too deep. and the little ones can play in it too???? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1779120220">Let&#39;s see....ways we invite water play:<br/>
<br/>
~Give the kids squirt bottles full of water and turn them loose on the<br/>
windows (outside usually) or on each other.<br/>
~Fill up buckets of water to play with on the deck.<br/>
~Use a variety of sprinklers<br/>
~Fill a plastic storage tub with warm water (usually in the kitchen)<br/>
and  spread towels all around<br/>
~Squirt guns<br/>
~Lotsa tub play....shaving cream to paint the tub walls with (it&#39;s<br/>
super cheap too), food dye in the water etc...<br/>
~Fill kitchen sink with warm sudsy water and put a bunch of pouring,<br/>
measuring tools in for play<br/>
~Kiddie pools on the deck<br/>
~Water balloon fights<br/>
<br/>
Jalen and Sierra love taking buckets of water and filling them up in<br/>
the kitchen, then pouring them on each other from the deck (one kid<br/>
stands on the ground while the other one pours from the 2nd level<br/>
deck). They think it&#39;s great fun!:)<br/>
<br/>
We had an idea for this year. We&#39;re going to buy some cheap plastic<br/>
tubing from Lowes and use it to fill their kiddie pools or plastic<br/>
tubs up. It can be run from the kitchen sink to the deck that way, so<br/>
we can warm their water up and start with warmer water for those cool<br/>
days.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-311829797">Well now I feel silly...I just sent water play suggestions for younger<br/>
kids and now realize the child in question is 11! Oops.:)<br/>
<br/>
If I could afford a pool, I&#39;d certainly consider putting one in for<br/>
him. There are measures to keep the little ones safe. They&#39;ll be safer<br/>
around water than kids that grow up without a pool! <br/>
<br/>
What about getting out to a lake where he can kayak and swim? Or get a<br/>
pool membership? We spend a TON of time in the water all summer.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-72229339">This is something I learned from sleeping on waterbeds for about 20 years:<br/>
<br/>
At the waterbed store (and probably at WalMart and other big stores) you can<br/>
buy an inexpensive plastic &quot;fill kit&quot; that will enable you to hookup any<br/>
normal garden water hose to any faucet in your house.  It has 3 or 4<br/>
adaptors to fit any size faucet.  You just screw off the aeration tip of the<br/>
faucet, and hook up the hose.  No specialty tubing/hose necessary. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
And at Lowe&#39;s they likely have adaptors to go &quot;faucet to hose&quot;, but to<br/>
ensure a proper fit you&#39;ll need to screw off the aerator from your faucet<br/>
and take it with you for sizing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1642553865">hi, my son loves water play, the hose game with dogs biting water began <br/>
the obsession, hes 13 now, today we sat in a big pile of watery mud in <br/>
our backyard and built mud cities , talking of resources neededand <br/>
bridging to the main land, when it went into covering feet with mud ,. <br/>
I still have to baby step myself in, saying are you sure you want to do <br/>
that, youll have to hose off, and hey not me, then okay but we&#39;ll have <br/>
to hose off before we go in, to not my face to a full out mud sling and <br/>
wrestle , ah , unschooling , can&#39;t beat it.<br/>
