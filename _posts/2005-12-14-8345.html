Is the unschooling conference already on the schedule for next year?  I&#39;d<br/>
love more information.  I live in central IL so the drive to St. Louis is<br/>
only about 2 hours or so.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Bummer, Lesa. The conference is a travelling show now. We&#39;re in Albuquerque, NM in 2006!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-594495363">Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Is there anybody who is interested in the Live and Learn conference <br/>
and has not registered yet?  I just received an invitation to a <br/>
wedding on Sept. 23 that requires an airline ticket and I can&#39;t afford <br/>
to do both.  Since the Live and Learn conference is none refundable, I <br/>
was wondering if any of you who would like to go would like to <br/>
purchase mine.  The registration would just get passed to you.  I&#39;ve <br/>
paid for (2) adult registration(3) Banquet, Dinner Show, Dance.  Our <br/>
children are 3 and younger.  It would be $285.<br/>
If you have any interest, please let me know.<br/>
<br/>
Shannon</div>
