<div id="ygrps-yiv-1140914909">hi all -<br/>
<br/>
my name is lyssa, mom to jessica (7) and henry (5).  my kids have recently played some video <br/>
games with friends and are now interested in bringing similar games into our house. they are <br/>
most interested in mario brothers and pokemon.<br/>
<br/>
this is a new area for me and am hoping somebody can help explain a few things:<br/>
<br/>
- what is the difference between a game cube, game boy, or nintendo ds?  which ones have <br/>
more than one player?  are these games interchangeabe?<br/>
- i&#39;m leaning towards something portable as we do some travel.  are the portable games <br/>
good for cars?  are there headphones?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-753351389">Hi Lyssa,<br/>
I&#39;m not the best at thesethings either, I&#39;m sure there will be <br/>
someone to come along and fill n the blanks.<br/>
But.. this is what I can tell you.<br/>
<br/>
multi player consoles:<br/>
ps 2 and 3, XBox, nintendo game cube, Wii, I think that there are a <br/>
couple that I have missed.<br/>
<br/>
Nintendo DS is a personal game console but, I beleive, if you know of <br/>
someone else that has one you can connect them up and play together.<br/>
Play station portable hasn&#39;t been very popular in my opinion but is <br/>
another one of the hand held game consoles.<br/>
<br/>
thats all I can help you with I&#39;m sure that some one else will be <br/>
able to help more.<br/>
Jac<br/>

<br/>
The GameCube is the predecessor of the Wii, which is currently on the<br/>
market.  You can still get GameCube consoles used from some retailers like<br/>
GameStop or from eBay.  They hook up to a TV and must be powered by plugging<br/>
into the wall.  Many games can be played by more than one player at a time,<br/>
but each player will normally have to have a controller, which is hooked up<br/>
to the console.<br/>
<br/>
The GameBoy is the predecessor of the Nintendo DS.  They are both handheld<br/>
game consoles.  The games are stored on small cartridges.  Some GameBoy<br/>
games can be played on the DS, but DS games cannot be played on the<br/>
GameBoy.  The DS Lite is the version currently on the market.  GameBoys and<br/>
DS handhelds are also available used.<br/>
<br/>
GameBoy and DS consoles are designed to be single player, but for certain<br/>
games special cables allow two or more players to play together or trade<br/>
info, each on his/her own handheld with his/her own game cartridge.  They<br/>
are designed to be portable.  The gameplay is generally not as complex and<br/>
the graphics are cruder, but the games are less expensive, also.<br/>
<br/>
Headphones are available for all consoles and handhelds.  In fact, most<br/>
headphones with the smaller standard jack will work.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know about what kind of resource you&#39;re looking for that would<br/>
explain different games.  Are you looking for game descriptions, or<br/>
information on age suitability or content?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1239648894"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; what is the difference between a game cube, game boy, or nintendo ds?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>which ones have more than one player? are these games interchangeable?<br/>
Nintendo DS is the current handheld gaming platform, took over from the<br/>
gameboy. The gamecube is a console system (not a handheld game system).<br/>
The gameboy is only multi player (usually just two players) if you<br/>
physically connect two gameboys together via a cable. The DS uses<br/>
wireless technology to connect to another DS or even in some<br/>
circumstances to the Internet (well, to the Nintendo-Net basically, they<br/>
can&#39;t really Surf the web, but they can connect up to other DS systems<br/>
via Nintendo). Gameboy games can play on the DS but the functionality<br/>
and graphics are not the greatest. The BIG difference between the<br/>
gameboy and the DS is that the DS uses a dual screen setup with one of<br/>
the screens being a touch screen (DO get the screen protector sheets);<br/>
using a gameboy game on the DS doesn&#39;t utilize that technology. Games<br/>
for the DS CANNOT be used on the Gameboy. I believe you can get an<br/>
&#39;adapter&#39; that allows Gameboy and DS games to be played on the Gamecube<br/>
(we have a PS2, PS3, two DS systems and 2 Gameboy Advanced SP systems).<br/>
<br/>
YES the DS and gameboy are excellent for travel (we got DS his first<br/>
Gameboy specifically for a 3 hour plane trip - he was about 5 at the<br/>
time). They all have pretty standard headphone jacks  - I think the<br/>
Gameboy systems might need an adapter (which is pretty easy to come by)<br/>
to plug a standard headphone into their jack. But any standard<br/>
headphones you want to use will work with them (whatever is comfortable<br/>
for the kids).<br/>
<br/>
What kind of info do you want as far as differences? My suggestion<br/>
(having BTDT) is to go to a local place like GameStop where you can get<br/>
USED handheld systems and actually hold them. I&#39;d get a pair of DS<br/>
handhelds (more games available, the older Gameboy systems no longer get<br/>
new development), get some spare styluses (styli?), screen protector<br/>
sheets, and a copy of Pokemon Diamond or Pearl (they can be found used<br/>
as well). Also, most of the staff at a place like GameStop are gamers in<br/>
their own right and generally very knowledgeable if you go in when it&#39;s<br/>
not busy (daytimes during the week are usually good) and just ask<br/>
questions and look at things.<br/>
