<div id="ygrps-yiv-776618815">We&#39;ve only been fully unschooled, and dipping our toe in the radical sidet for a very short time, but wanted to share some of the happy, happy HAPPY that has come our way since we got brave.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday my 8 year old son made breakfast, unasked, for his three siblings and I.  For someone who I used to nag to even take his own plate out, this is huge!!!<br/>
<br/>
After I&#39;d thanked him, I asked him why he decided to do it, and he replied &quot;because I&#39;m happy, and I want to make you all feel it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to stick this in my journal to go back to on a bleaker day, because I want to remember it forever.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also loved talking to my children, and finding out what makes them tick....I&#39;ll confess right now that I&#39;d never taken so much time to just talk to them.  I&#39;d previously made a lot of assumptions that, as Mother, I knew best.  <br/>
<br/>
I do have a question though, regarding PC use.  My son has recently discovered RoBlox, and has played it alot....to the point that he said his eyes hurt.  He started up the PC this morning, and after a couple of hours, I reminded him of how his eyes had hurt the day before, and he came off.  I didn&#39;t tell him to come off, but I wonder if he thought that is what I was saying as in the past I&#39;ve been very controlling over the PC.  Should I just leave him to work out when enough is enough, or is it OK to remind him about his eyes?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1173132970">Ask him if he wants reminders about his eyes. Find some information about how to help because I am sure with so many people who works in computers for many many hours a day that there must be things you can do to help.<br/>
Oh and my son learned to read amazingly well and early playing Roblox. I absolutely love Roblox and I am a big fan.<br/>
He has moved on  and only rarely played lately but he is mario555555.<br/>
There is so much learning in Roblox! and many other games. Check out some great Roblox videos on YouTube too.<br/>
I still write sometimes &quot;OH NOES&quot; because of Roblox and our dog name is Bloxie!<br/>

<br/>
Ask him if he&#39;d like reminders or not. Whatever he picks, let him know  <br/>
he can change his mind and try something else.<br/>
