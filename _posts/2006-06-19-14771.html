<div id="ygrps-yiv-504028307">Last night, my dd8 told me that she missed doing homeschool work.  <br/>
Now, I should first mention that I am a recovering curriculum <br/>
junkie.  I truly have *no* desire to go back down that path, however <br/>
I want to give my children what they need.  I just don&#39;t want to <br/>
lose my head with it.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Allison has always been the type of child who loves schoolwork.  She <br/>
was &quot;doing school&quot; at a very early age.  She loved workbooks and <br/>
reading.  She beamed at the sight of her Calvert materials during <br/>
her K through 2nd grade years.  But by the end of 2nd grade, she was <br/>
beginning to lose interest.  Schoolwork isn&#39;t as much fun once you <br/>
approach 3rd grade because the work is getting more busy.  It wasn&#39;t <br/>
challenging for her brain, but for her hands, if that made sense.<br/>
<br/>
How can I help her do school with materials that will be fun and not <br/>
boring schoolwork busy?  Understand?  We tease around about doing <br/>
preK and K again because it was just so much fun, but it&#39;s not <br/>
reasonable because the work is too easy.  I&#39;ve tried asking her <br/>
exactly what she misses from school but the question is just too <br/>
vague I think.  She can&#39;t give me a good answer.  How can I rephrase <br/>
the question to find out exactly what she needs right now?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s unreasonable to have fun?  :-)  Doing something just because it<br/>
is fun is a perfectly good reason to do it.  It doesn&#39;t matter if it<br/>
is easy.  I find knitting to be easy, but I still do  it because it is<br/>
something that I enjoy.  It&#39;s ok to have workbooks around if that is<br/>
what she wants to do.  Get a few and stick them on a shelf.  Let her<br/>
know that they are there if she wishes to do them and that she is not<br/>
*required* to do them.  Then fill her life with all kinds of<br/>
interesting things to do and eventually they might lose their<br/>
importance in her life as something that she may feel she &quot;needs&quot; to<br/>
do in order to homeschool.<br/>
<br/>
We have various workbooks in our home.  Keon recently did one on Time<br/>
and MOney that is put out by Disney.  I think he enjoyed it because it<br/>
was like a puzzle and had stickers and pictures of characters he<br/>
likes.  He did it because it was something fun not something that was<br/>
required.  And interestingly he got almost a whole page of money<br/>
problems incorrect.  Wanting to find out what was whirling inside his<br/>
brain I asked him how he came up with the answers.  For instance the<br/>
problem would say, &quot;Andy has $2.  He buys a book for $1.51.  How much<br/>
change will he get back.&quot;  Keon said it was fifty cents.  I asked him<br/>
how he came up with that figure and he said, &quot;Well, it&#39;s really 49¢<br/>
but you always find a penny on the ground or under the seat cushion so<br/>
you might as well say 50¢.&quot;  :-)<br/>

<br/>
But if you&#39;re not attached to the workbooks in any way, shape or form,<br/>
then pre-k and K should be just fine in order to meet her need to<br/>
dabble with that stuff. The easier and more fun, the better!!<br/>
<br/>
I agree with letting her pick some stuff out, put it on the shelf and<br/>
give it no more importance than anything else in your lives. Help her<br/>
if she asks for it, but fill your lives with fun and interesting<br/>
activities too.  You might find them gathering dust after a while.<br/>
<br/>
Sierra (9) has always been drawn to workbooks and such. She&#39;s been<br/>
unschooled her entire life, so it&#39;s just something different and<br/>
fascinating to her. She buys them occasionally, but most of them sit<br/>
there ignored. It&#39;s funny. If she does pull them out, she has her own<br/>
ideas about how to use them. Following the directions is not high on<br/>
her priority list at this time. Good!:)<br/>

<br/>
Why not just pick up some workbooks that look interesting, or the <br/>
type she might like (based on her history of loving to do this type <br/>
of thing!) and add them to the books etc you already have.  Or maybe <br/>
have her help you pick out a few she&#39;d like.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if you&#39;re worried that because she&#39;s expressing an <br/>
interest, that she&#39;ll want to go back to the way things were before <br/>
(or even want to go to SCHOOL!), or maybe because you&#39;re a self-<br/>
professed curriculum junkie you&#39;re afraid it will be harder for YOU <br/>
to not get caught up in it again &lt;bwg&gt;!   I think workbooks can be <br/>
part of unschooling, IF it&#39;s something the child chooses.   And she <br/>
may do a few pages here and there, then not touch it again for a <br/>
long time.   A little bit may be just enough to satisfy her <br/>
curiosity or to fill the need.   I don&#39;t think it has to be viewed <br/>
as a &quot;bad thing&quot;.<br/>

fun anymore, just math problems that require lots of writing of <br/>

She&#39;s also loved arts and crafts but she&#39;s getting bored by the <br/>

hasn&#39;t liked puzzles larger than 100 pieces because they&#39;re too <br/>
complex, but maybe she&#39;s going through a growth spurt where all her <br/>
normal activities are too easy and boring and she&#39;s ready to bump it <br/>
up a notch.  We can go buy some puzzles that are 200 or 300 pieces.  <br/>
She wanted to go to Target today anyway to look at the generic brand <br/>
of American Girl dolls.  That might be cool.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1016970998">Is she specifically asking for workbooks, or just to do some &quot;homeschooling<br/>
work&quot; of some kind?  Workbooks suck.  Ok, I know some people like them but<br/>
there are lots of alternatives :)<br/>
<br/>
Some things my kids enjoy that may feel &quot;schoolish&quot; enough for her :)<br/>
- Pick a topic of interest and make an e-notebook to share with the family<br/>
(we use powerpoint mostly, because they love playing with the animations and<br/>
transitions and stuff, but others use Word or Publisher or Printmaster).<br/>
They could also design web pages on the topic.<br/>
- Pick a topic and make a movie, using imovie or Windows movie maker.  Use<br/>
pictures or video clips from the internet, and record your own narration.<br/>
Share the movie online and with family.<br/>
- Pick a topic and make a scrapbook with paper and scrapbooking supplies,<br/>
pictures from magazines and the internet, etc.  Share it with family and<br/>
friends.<br/>
- Help her start a blog.  Make sure you keep a close eye on the information<br/>
that is shared of course.<br/>
- Buy her a fun cool-looking journal that she can write in when she feels<br/>
the urge.<br/>
- Show her some cool math/science websites and games that are intended for<br/>
learning.  She will likely be able to tell the difference between these and<br/>
games that are for entertainment purposes and they may make her feel that<br/>
she is &quot;doing schoolwork&quot;.  A great math one is www.coolmath4kids.com and a<br/>
great science one that my kids like is www.iknowthat.com (it has lots of<br/>
stuff besides science, but they particularly like the Optics Workbench)<br/>
- Play some math games, like from Family Math, or get a subscription to<br/>
Aleks.com if she&#39;s interested in that.<br/>
- Do some &quot;science experiments&quot;; there are millions of them online, or in<br/>
books from the library.<br/>
- Speaking of the library, go there and help her find books on topics that<br/>
interest her; look at the videos and cds too.<br/>
- See if she&#39;s interested in memorization games.  Memorize songs, lists,<br/>
skip counting, whatever.<br/>
- She could pick a book she wants to read and set up a book club online with<br/>
other kids who want to do something like that, where they read it together<br/>
and talk about it together (you could facilitate it for her).  Lots of<br/>
people love that sort of thing.<br/>
<br/>
I know some of this may be stuff you already do, but if she&#39;s asking for<br/>
homeschool work, there is some kind of learning she is yearning for and she<br/>
may not know exactly what it is, so you could just keep trying various ideas<br/>
until one sounds good to her.<br/>
