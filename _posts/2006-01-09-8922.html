<div id="ygrps-yiv-1323494493">The glow sticks stories make me cringe a bit....Once at some festival we bought our boys some glowsticks and glowing necklaces. They thought they were great. We had great conversations abt the chemical that might be in them, etc.....Then, it was time to go home. It was dark out and we live abt an hour from anywhere... and they were enjoying their glowsticks on the ride home, la la la la happy day....and then I caught a whiff of a strange chemical like scent and the son who was 4 at the time had somehow broken his open and all I could see was this eerily glowing face and splash like marks on clothes, and glowing lips and glowing fingertips and I think I yelled &quot;Ackk&quot; and accidentally scared everyone ........I was scared to death....It was a strong alcoholy smell...anyway ...the tiniest bit came out and he was acting fine and its years gone by now and oh, the stain does not come out of clothing ....:)......<br/>
