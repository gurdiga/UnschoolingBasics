<div id="ygrps-yiv-436241420">Good morning everyone.  Just want to share what happened in our home<br/>
over the past month.  <br/>
<br/>
At the end of February our Lutino Cockatiels mating paid off and 4<br/>
precious eggs were laid throughout one week.  Starting last Monday<br/>
we&#39;ve had 3 hatch with one still waiting.  Zak and Brooke were<br/>
ecstatic when they woke (well I woke Brooke) to see a hatched egg. <br/>
The parents are very protective so we couldn&#39;t see the chick until<br/>
Gloria the male (we named these birds BEFORE we knew the sex...LOL)<br/>
came out hissing and pecking in our direction.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s truly amazing to see how fast they grow!  DD said that the chicks<br/>
are so ugly that they&#39;re cute.  Our cat seems quite interested in<br/>
whats happening in the cage too. :-)  Also funny because while DD is<br/>
looking forward to keeping the birds, DS is counting the profits. <br/>
We&#39;ve decided not to sell them to a pet store and instead will begin<br/>
handfeeding in a couple of weeks then sell them when ready.<br/>
<br/>
Thus far the experience has been so interesting.  It&#39;s so neat to<br/>
actually see the parents regurgitate and the baby&#39;s putting their<br/>
beaks in the parents mouth in real life, rather than from a book or<br/>
movie.  We realize too that maybe all the chicks in the brood won&#39;t<br/>
make it as I&#39;ve already witnessed one chick getting shoved out by its<br/>
siblings, but its life.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just wanted to share.  Hope that you guys have a super weekend.<br/>
<br/>
~Sandy</div>
