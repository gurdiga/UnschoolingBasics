<div id="ygrps-yiv-1887658188">It&#39;s so weird that this Alfie Kohn came up this week.  On Tuesday at our<br/>
play group two mothers (whom I think would make great unschoolers) were just<br/>
talking about him.  I hadn&#39;t even heard of him before that.  I forwarded a<br/>
portion of Ren&#39;s post to them.  I also pointed out that John Holt has a<br/>
quote on the cover of the &quot;Continuum Concept&quot; book.  One of them says she<br/>
lives by that book.  Have any of you read it?  I&#39;m reading it now.  So now<br/>
for my question, I don&#39;t want to seem like I&#39;m pushing unschooling on them,<br/>
but I really think they&#39;d agree with it if they had more info.  Neither of<br/>
them really know much about it.  One of them, W, has already enrolled her<br/>
2.5 yo in a pre-school mainly b/c she needs a break, and though she would<br/>
love to homeschool, she&#39;s said she has concerns about losing the time for<br/>
herself.  Can you guys help me out with links and books to direct them to to<br/>
give them some more info.<br/>

 Unschooling is a *very* natural progression to the Continuum Concept.<br/>

How would you deal with your children in the same situation?<br/>
<br/>
Mention it. Ask whether they&#39;d like more info. If they do, have some <br/>
available. If they don&#39;t, you&#39;re done. For now.<br/>
<br/>
Live an unschooling life. If they like what they see, they&#39;ll ask.<br/>

She will have many, many years all to herself. But she can *never* get <br/>
these few years back.<br/>
<br/>
Rue Kream&#39;s book, Parenting a Free Child: An Unschooled Llife<br/>
<br/>
My simplest way to refocus myself is to think of Lisa Strobler, Joanna <br/>
Wilkinson, and Diana Jenner. All three women lost a child: Jacob at <br/>
five, Sam at eight, and Hannah (just two months ago) at nine. That&#39;s <br/>
all I need to know that these very few years are what I get with my <br/>
children. Sending them off to school will shorten the time I get to <br/>
spend with them. And only *I* get to choose whether I spend that time <br/>
being *with* them or *BEING* with them. I choose BEING with them.<br/>
<br/>
If something were to happen to one of them or to me, I KNOW that I did <br/>
everything I could to make these years wonderful, magical, and joyful. <br/>
I won&#39;t regret ever having them home with me, and my memories will be <br/>
sweet.<br/>
<br/>
If we all live to be 100, I *still* know I won&#39;t have any regrets---BUT <br/>
I would have so many memories that we could share *together*.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1601951667">hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;m enjoying reading the posts in this group and have a quesstion.<br/>
<br/>
Ive been working towards unschooling and am having an &#39;issue&#39;(for want of a <br/>
better word) with jobs done around the house.<br/>
<br/>
We at the moment have fairly high standards as to how our house must look as <br/>
we are in the process of selling it and I want it to look good incase <br/>
someone wants to come and view.<br/>
<br/>
My son is 8, up til a few weeks ago i would get him to help me with stuff, <br/>
clearing up, just doing things i felt i needed help with.  I have since <br/>
stopped doing that, asking him if he wants to help and when he says no, not <br/>
being bothered and getting on with it myself.<br/>
<br/>
It feels really difficult, and almost as if he&#39;s worse now than he was <br/>
before.  Say, for example, before he would put his rubbish in the rubbish <br/>
bin and now he wont do that.  I&#39;ve been taking the view that he just isnt <br/>
bothered about putting it in the bin.<br/>
<br/>
the thing I feel stuck with, is, is he just doing this so that i can clean <br/>
up after him? is he being disrespectful?  I&#39;m just abit stuck,  I had it all <br/>
sorted a few days ago and now i&#39;ve lost some faith!!<br/>
<br/>
Any help, would be great<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>These are some of the thoughts going through my head as I scramble to find the resources to get Qacei to England this summer. It&#39;s looking like to make it work I&#39;m going to need to go with her. Big hardship? No! I&#39;ve just gotta find the money magically from a negative bank balance. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all worth it though. It&#39;s a dream and a memory all rolled into one. We will BE with each other and be there for each other. I could spend the $1500 on tuition or curriculum, or I can help her fufill a dream.  It&#39;s a no brainer.<br/>
<br/>
Of course this is an extreme example, and no I&#39;m not putting myself into bankruptcy to do this. I&#39;m just pulling out every piece of creative energy I&#39;ve got to make this happen for her. I did the same thing in much smaller ways when she was a much smaller person.<br/>

We at the moment have fairly high standards as to how our house must <br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Yeah---when we sold our last house, Ben and Cameron moved to Columbia <br/>
in July. I stayed to sell the house. It took eight months. But BOY! did <br/>
that house look GOOD! No one but me there, and I worked all day! &lt;G&gt; <br/>
The house was spotless with only me in it---and only at night! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a matter of trust. He may not really believe you mean it. He <br/>
probably thinks you&#39;ve just gone a little mad and will start making him <br/>
pick up any day now. That&#39;s normal.<br/>
<br/>
I personally would have waited until we were moved in to the new house <br/>
before I lifted the cleaning rule.<br/>
<br/>
He probably ISN&#39;T bothered by it. Bt I&#39;d still ask. Just because you&#39;re <br/>
not requiring it, doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t ask. He&#39;s only eight---he has <br/>
different priorities.<br/>
<br/>
OOOH! Does he *want* to move? Or is he mad about leaving this house? <br/>
That could give you some insight into what his motivation is! He might <br/>
clean up voluntarily if he knows that a clean house might sell more <br/>
quickly. At the same time, losing the only home he&#39;s ever known might <br/>
inhibit the desire to get it sold tomorrow!<br/>
<br/>
Ask him.<br/>
<br/>

clean<br/>

<br/>
I think he&#39;s eight. I think he has different priorities. I think you <br/>
should ask him how he feels about the move.<br/>
