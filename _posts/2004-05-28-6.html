<div id="ygrps-yiv-238408687">My computer is totally frozen right now...glad to see so many of you <br/>
have made it over already. I&#39;m up at the library, just couldn&#39;t stay <br/>
away, seeing as the list is so new and all.:)<br/>
Thank goodness we live like ONE minute from a library with internet <br/>
computers.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have recent bubbly, fun unschooling days to share?<br/>
That might be a good place to start.<br/>
<br/>
We found out a couple of days ago, that centipedes protect their <br/>
larvae!! ooh. We&#39;re watching a mama and her babies underneath a <br/>
stepping stone (that is awaiting a new location until after babies <br/>
are all grown up) and they&#39;ve grown more than double in size in just <br/>
a day and a half! Totally amazing. And the mama is still curled up <br/>
with them, keeping them safe (or so she thinks) from our marauding <br/>
feet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-417456594">Today has been really nice, and quiet. Jaiden and Avery went out with my step mom for a little while today, I had a few hours alone, spent most of that on the computer:). When they got back they had strawberry plants and pots. We&#39;re going to plant them tomorrow, after I get home from work. Jason just left to go fix a flat tire, the boys and I made a cake and planned dinner. They are in the bathroom right now making magic potions, for me to try. Jason will be bringing a few movies home tonight, and we have plans to all pile up on the couch with snacks and movies. <br/>
<br/>
Nice, quiet, happy and relaxed.<br/>
I love it<br/>

going on this week:</font></span></div>

<div><span class="ygrps-yiv-1162563497392422621-28052004"><font face="Arial" color="#0000ff" size="2">Rowan 
(who&#39;s 7) has been picking up more and more about reading over the past 
year.&nbsp; She&#39;d lie in bed with me at night and look at my book over my 
shoulder, pointing out words she knew or asking me what something said.&nbsp; 
She started noticing she could read a lot of signs and things on TV, and she 
asked a TON of questions about letters and words and spelling and 
language.&nbsp; Recently we went to the Scholastic Warehouse sale, and one of 
the things we bought was a Spongebob comic-strip style book.&nbsp; It has a 
bunch of episodes in it, and one is the F.U.N. one (I&#39;m assuming most of you 
start hearing that song when I say that &lt;G&gt;).&nbsp; So, one morning Rowan 
told me that she had read a whole story by herself and that she could read it in 
her head - she was amazed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she read it to me.&nbsp; She 
remembered some of the harder words from the episode which she&#39;s seen 
approximately 10 bazillion times, but even those she really *read* to me, 
looking at the word and how the letters went together.&nbsp; She&#39;s so excited 
and now wants to read to everyone.&nbsp; She read Cinderella to Jon last 
night.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></span></div>

of new books, which is pretty much all she needs in life to be happy (don&#39;t know 
where she gets it...).&nbsp; She&#39;s doing a lot of drawing - mostly faces and 
manga, which is a new interest.&nbsp; She set up a library last week with all 
the things we bought at the book sale.&nbsp;&nbsp; Today she designed a cover 
for the book I&#39;m writing. We&#39;re not sure it&#39;ll be used, but she wanted to make 
one anyway.&nbsp; It&#39;s very colorful and cool.&nbsp; She made a paper person to 
exchange with other unschoolers from dotcom.&nbsp; She&#39;s been writing a lot of 
plays and is planning to make a theatre in our playroom.&nbsp; She spent hours 
and hours painting a huge ceramic piggy bank for her cousin&#39;s bday.&nbsp;

Jon and the kids are coming.&nbsp; The owner asked them to paint a ceramic lamp 
for the work area of the studio.&nbsp; Not sure what they&#39;ll come up with, but 
I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be interesting :0).&nbsp; My niece and two nephews will be 
arriving from Ireland on Sunday night.&nbsp; We&#39;ve never met my nephews, who are 
close to Dagny and Ro in age, so we&#39;re excited.&nbsp;&nbsp; We&#39;ve all been 
magnet crazy lately.&nbsp; We&#39;ve got 4 or 5 different sets we&#39;ve bought at 
different times and we&#39;re having fun using them all together.&nbsp; We&#39;ve all 
spent a lot of time on homestarrunner.com, giggling our heads 
off.&nbsp;&nbsp;Next week we&#39;ll be making our own &#39;look-alike&#39;s, and everywhere 
we go we&#39;re looking for things we can use.&nbsp; </font></span></div>
