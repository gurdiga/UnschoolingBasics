<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
1) Apologize---MOST sincerely and honestly.<br/>
<br/>
2) Tell them why you did it (bad modeling by your own parents, lack of <br/>
better tools in your parenting toolbox, need for power, whatever).<br/>
<br/>
3) Tell them how you felt when it happened/happens to you.<br/>
<br/>
4) Don&#39;t do it again.<br/>
<br/>
In case you *do* do it again: Beforehand, decide on a &quot;cue word&quot; they <br/>
can say to you to call you on it. If they *do* have to call you on it, <br/>
back down IMMEDIATELY and apologize for falling back to old ways. Since <br/>
you would probably be falling back on old &quot;tools&quot; when tired, hungry, <br/>
hormonal, or frustrated, you need to be able to switch gears and not <br/>
get angry all over again because they&#39;re letting you know you&#39;re <br/>
backpedaling. This will also help you tend to your own body&#39;s needs <br/>
more attentively. (It did for me!) They may *not* call you on it the <br/>
first few hundred times because they are afraid of the consequences <br/>
(younger children are more apt to take that risk! &lt;G&gt;). But if they <br/>
feel confident enough that you&#39;re serious, they will eventually stand <br/>
up for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Let them be *your* partners in being better parents. I can guarantee <br/>
the children want better parents! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1) Apologize to your kids for your husband&#39;s behavior---MOST sincerely <br/>
and honestly. Let them know you are their partner in this and that you <br/>
want to protect them physically and emotionally, but that their dad is <br/>
their dad and wants the same thing---he just doesn&#39;t have a good handle <br/>
on how to do it ...yet.<br/>
<br/>
2) Tell them why you think he did it (bad modeling by his parents, lack <br/>
of better tools in his parenting toolbox, need for power, whatever). <br/>
Help them see that dad needs help in being the best dad he can be, but <br/>
that parts don&#39;t come naturally to him. Let them know that, although he <br/>
*wants* to be better, this isn&#39;t easy for him. Brainstorm ways for all <br/>
of you to *make* it easier for him.<br/>
<br/>
3) Tell them how you felt/feel when it happened/happens to you. (My <br/>
guess is that he doesn&#39;t shame *just* the kids---that this is his MO in <br/>
dealing with everyone.) Talk about how *he* must have been shamed as a <br/>
boy and how *he* must&#39;ve felt as a little one---both to him and to the <br/>
children. Be compassionate---know that he hurt too.<br/>
<br/>
4) Help him not do it again. By being a buffer whenever possible. By <br/>
being the change you want to see. By modeling the way you want both of <br/>
you to deal with the kids. By pointing out when what he does better IS <br/>
working. And as Meredith says (way better than I can): praise his <br/>
efforts---no matter how puny---and even if he&#39;s not doing much of <br/>
anything different. &lt;g&gt; Meredith, how DO you put this so well?<br/>
<br/>
All that said (or written &lt;g&gt;)---it&#39;s still something *he* has to <br/>
change. *You* can&#39;t change him---only *he* can do that. But you can <br/>
help give him tools if he&#39;s willing to accept them.<br/>
<br/>
Maisha, does Jabari read here? Do you share things like this with him?<br/>
<br/>
I know he&#39;s made some headway recently. Why is that? What&#39;s changed? <br/>
Could you take the above, print it out, and tape it to the bathroom <br/>
mirror? Would he be offended? Or pleased to have more tools?<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
No, he’s not a big reader.  He’s more of a visual/meet-in-person type of guy.  If this were on a dvd (hint, hint) he would watch it – while playing a video game LOL.  That’s how he pays attention.  And if he meets someone in person he’ll listen and ask questions.  But the reading thing….not so much.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I know he&#39;s made some headway recently. Why is that? What&#39;s changed?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Honestly, what’s changed is that he isn’t living here right now :(  It’s not my plan (or his) for it to remain that way, but it’s just what needed to happen right now.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Would he be offended? Or pleased to have more tools?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I think at this point he would be pleased to have more tools.  And so would I! He’s open to learning more and so am I (Retrouvaille next weekend – thank you Kelly!)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We will all be at the LnL conference.  I’m excited about him coming and going to the dad’s session – where apparently there are *no* women allowed LOL.  I really believe that the conference will be an eye opening experience for the both of us.<br/>

<br/>
Do you know about Dayna Martin&#39;s Youtube videos? Talks about <br/>
unschooling and mindful parenting in a &quot;video&quot; format.<br/>
<br/>
Anybody got a quick link? I miss the Link Fairy of groups past! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not a LoA kind of gal, but Dayna has some great videos that could <br/>
help a lot. She&#39;s very sweet and personable, and that shows in her <br/>
videos. She&#39;ll be a the NEUConference too.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Well, I read that y&#39;all had separated somewhere---and then that things <br/>
were better. So I wasn&#39;t really sure what was happening.<br/>
<br/>
Ren and her husband split for a while several (wow---many! now that I <br/>
think about it) years ago now. It helped them refocus and decide what <br/>
they wanted.<br/>
<br/>
-==-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think at this point he would be pleased to have more tools.  And so <br/>
would I!<br/>
He’s open to learning more and so am I (Retrouvaille next weekend – <br/>

Kelly!)<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m SOOO glad! I&#39;ll be thinking about you both! It&#39;ll be a hard <br/>
weekend---and it&#39;s not an overnight cure!---but it will help you decide <br/>
which way to go from here.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck!! We&#39;re pulling for you here!<br/>

<br/>
Yep. We found that moms tend to kind of....ahhhh...*run the show* if <br/>
allowed access. We tend to shut the guys down. This way the guys can <br/>
ask questions and break off into smaller groups and discuss and <br/>
question and ponder.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really excited you&#39;ll be coming! I can&#39;t wait to meet you!<br/>

<br/>
Yes, I know that I have done this.  Even if I dont say anything I give the<br/>
look that says I disapprove of what you are doing.  For Jabari, who has<br/>
always felt unaccepted, it was the same thing as me saying I disapprove of<br/>
you.  And coming from the home he came from, with the lack of love and tons<br/>
of abuse, my criticism did nothing to help him feel better about himself.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
As a child I lived in a house of criticism, and the premise was (I guess)<br/>
that pointing out what you did wrong helped you not to do it again and to<br/>
become a better person.  I work hard not to do that with our children, but I<br/>
have fallen short of doing it with the one person who is my true partner in<br/>
raising them.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I still have more deschooling to do :)<br/>

I was struggling with &quot;praise&quot; but couldn&#39;t wrap my head around <br/>
anything better at the moment---even though I knew it wasn&#39;t right by a <br/>
long shot. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah--it&#39;s about honoring him where he is now, which seems so easy with <br/>
the children. So much harder with the spouse. Really unfair, in many <br/>
ways, but I still do it. :-(<br/>
<br/>
Sincere appreciation for his efforts---no matter how small or <br/>
&quot;ineffective&quot; will help him move in a better, kinder direction too.<br/>
