<div id="ygrps-yiv-173768366">I am having problems finding ways for all my kids to play what they<br/>
want without having tiny game pieces getting spread everywhere. We<br/>
have five kids and my dd 6yo and dd 4yo want to play blokus,<br/>
jigsaws,knex, and other games. Problem is they wont pick up the small<br/>
pieces and my dd 14mnths is mobile and can get into their games. When<br/>
I say play in your room then I am not available to help them when they<br/>
need it and if they get in a disagreement 4yo tends to throw the<br/>
pieces either at her sister or all over the place, sometimes it has<br/>
been her brothers 500 pc jigsaw thats been thrown.<br/>
<br/>
1.How to keep it safe for baby?<br/>
2.How to not have pieces lost/spread all over the room.<br/>
3.How have those of you with big families set your house up to cope<br/>
with this, give each child space but not be stuck in their room every<br/>
time they want a game with little pieces?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1376795510">Don&#39;t have a lot of kids or a toddler but we&#39;ve found that big ziplock<br/>
bags make it really easy to just scoop the pieces in and go rather than<br/>
having to fit everything into the &quot;Correct&quot; spot in the box (and some<br/>
game boxes are pretty picky about just how to put stuff). Or, small<br/>
storage containers of various sizes/types can contain the little pieces.<br/>
For Legos (and we&#39;ve got LOTS of Legos), we&#39;d set out an old sheet or<br/>
tablecloth that can be scooped up a la a &#39;hobo pack&#39; and the whole lot<br/>
plopped into a big rubbermaid bin. Basically, making it SUPER easy for<br/>
them (or anyone else) to just scoop the pieces and have them out of the<br/>
way of Baby sibling with minimal interruption in the flow of playing.<br/>
Also, ziplocks/containers can contain the pieces not currently in use as<br/>
well - for example, have each color of pieces in Blokus (a favorite here<br/>
too BTW) have it&#39;s own plastic resealable container (a la the ziplock<br/>
storage containers) so that only the pieces they need are exposed on the<br/>
board, the rest are still in the (uncovered but still contained)<br/>
container - less scattering of pieces.<br/>

bags, Deb... Mo Loves bins and bags - loves to empty them out and have <br/>
lots of charming, empty bins and bags to play with!!!! &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 I still use them as a way of cleaning up, and it *is* easier than <br/>
trying to get everything back into the original packaging, but I&#39;ve <br/>
also really had to let go of the idea that its possible to keep whole <br/>
sets of things for very long. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have any advice for the OP other than getting a shop-vac. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I love this idea. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Because my children are all around 2 years apart this has been an <br/>
ongoing problem.<br/>
- With the second baby we just delayed getting much small stuff. We <br/>
got crates of duplo at garage sales so that Felicity and her friends <br/>
could build really complicated structures and still keep the <br/>
individual pieces big. Wooden train tracks are complex but the pieces <br/>
are big. We invested in hundreds of pieces of train, track trains, <br/>
train destinations etc. By the time the third was born we started <br/>
getting lots of small stuff, but it still helps to have lots of <br/>
complex big stuff that we can all do together.<br/>
-Playing on cookie sheets at a high the table where the baby couldn&#39;t <br/>
reach and the edges made the pieces less likely to fall on the floor.<br/>
-In our living room we got a gated metal enclosure and put it in the <br/>
corner (by KIDCO I think-similar to what people use around fire <br/>
places for child proofing fireplaces, but hexagonal) . The older kids <br/>
could open and close the gate, the baby could not. They still all got <br/>
to be in the same room. This would often frustrate the baby though.<br/>
-At one point we had a graco play yard set up for my three year old <br/>
to play with small pieces in (she needed help in and out) and the <br/>
gated enclosure for my then 5 year old to play with different small <br/>
pieces both my small living room.  It helped not just with safety, <br/>
but also prevented the baby (known at that time as babyzilla) from <br/>
knocking down or ripping apart everything that the older girls were <br/>
doing. It was their choice when to go in or out of these enclosures, <br/>
and they were solutions we came up with together. It sounds crazy, <br/>
but it helped them all be able to play in the same room and be close <br/>
to mama at the same time.<br/>
-The older girls also play together or separately on a high captain&#39;s <br/>
bed where the baby can&#39;t climb up ...yet.<br/>
-I think the ultimate would be a raised loft with a rope ladder (to <br/>
pull up) in the living room. Even an ikea loft bed might work for this.<br/>
- My 3 year old was always a big pacifier user as a baby. Giving it <br/>
to her when we were using small things or paint tended to keep her <br/>
from putting other things in her mouth.<br/>
<br/>
As I said before the main problem with most of these solutions is <br/>
that the baby gets very annoyed that she can&#39;t follow her sisters and <br/>
play with the small pieces too. I try to distract her, but the big <br/>
sisters are hands down her favorite activity.<br/>
<br/>
If you come up with any other ideas -let me know.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-234786621">***1.How to keep it safe for baby?***<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Does your baby put stuff in her mouth?  Sometimes or all the time? <br/>
Can you hang out with her and say &quot;take that out of your mouth.&quot;  when <br/>
she shoves something in there? <br/>
<br/>
I work in a flower shop and the owners little girl has been there since <br/>
she was born.  She&#39;s almost thirteen months old.  Flower shops have <br/>
stems and leaves and matter on the floor all the time and she went from <br/>
a baby who would shove everything in her mouth to a very discerning <br/>
nibbler in a matter of days.  Now she only grazes on found cracker bits <br/>
and cookie crumbs and the like.  <br/>
<br/>
Choking is less a hazard when the child is attended.  Not everything <br/>
that goes into a baby&#39;s mouth will cause choking. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
***2.How to not have pieces lost/spread all over the room.***<br/>
<br/>
Have a bin for lost items.  When you&#39;re picking up, if you don&#39;t know <br/>
where something belongs, stick it in the lost items bin.  Then it&#39;s  <br/>
only lost until someone saunters over to the bin and grabs it for their <br/>
project.<br/>
<br/>
With little kids you&#39;re just going to have toys spread around.  That&#39;s <br/>
how it is.  Accept it the way you accept that grass will grow and birds <br/>
will poop on your sheets when they&#39;re hanging on the line. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
***3.How have those of you with big families set your house up to cope<br/>
 with this, give each child space but not be stuck in their room every<br/>
time they want a game with little pieces?***<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have a big family but I think most of your fears can be <br/>
relieved by just hanging out with the kids when they&#39;re playing.  <br/>
Asking your baby to take small, non food items out of her face, and <br/>
relaxing a little will help.  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>DS was about 5 when his little cousin was born. We knew there would <br/>
be family gatherings (at our place and elsewhere) where DS would <br/>
want to have some of his toys out. We talked about the situation and <br/>
used a handy bit of information to *empower* DS regarding small <br/>
bits/choking hazards: when baby cousin is around, anything that can <br/>
fit through a toilet paper tube needs to be &quot;guarded&quot; - that is, DS <br/>
or some adult needs to be keeping an eye on it at all times, it <br/>
can&#39;t be just left laying out on it&#39;s own. We kept several empty TP <br/>
tubes handy (also good to play with, disposable, cheap, even <br/>
gnawable for a toddler) and DS would check items and decide whether <br/>
to play with them/bring them and so on. His own choice in the matter <br/>
was a big help in his cooperating with making sure stuff got put <br/>
away - even if HE didn&#39;t do the tidying, he&#39;d make sure it got done <br/>
by asking for help with it &quot;to make sure it&#39;s safe for baby&quot;. Over <br/>
time, DS got better at eyeballing sizes AND cousin got older. Now, <br/>
we&#39;re going to be doing that again because another SIL is due next <br/>
March (now DS is 9 and &quot;baby&quot; cousin is 4).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was always quite slack about little things being on the floor and<br/>
did not have kids who put everything in their mouths. But a few weeks<br/>
ago my just turned 4yo who did not have a habit of it and has been the<br/>
only pacifier-using kid, still is,ie. has something in her mouth<br/>
anyway! came up to DS and announced she ate money!! Then started<br/>
crying really badly as it started to hurt all the way down, so we<br/>
rushed up to the ER with a hysterical kid in pain but just as we got<br/>
100yds from the ER door I think it dropped into her stomach and the<br/>
pain stopped. So had Xray and three days of poop searching to make<br/>
sure it came out. <br/>
<br/>
I just cant imagine if that penny had gone in her wind pipe instead,<br/>
just made me think about small stuff around combined with having so<br/>
many kids to be there for, compared to devoting all my time to one or two.<br/>
<br/>
Also was at ER 2 days ago for 11yo ds to get a few minor stitches, and<br/>
friend shows up with 6yo son who worked a penny so far up his nose<br/>
even the doc had trouble getting it out!!!!!!!!</div>

then sort them out after? LOL<br/>
<br/>
Just like the Noo Noo on Teletubbies.<br/>
<br/>
Might experiment with our shop-vac!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Also you said you let go of the idea of having complete sets of<br/>
things. What do you do if child comes back a week later wanting all<br/>
the bits,it belongs to more than one kid, or as we are completely<br/>
broke and cant buy new stuff?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Mostly these aren&#39;t issues in our house - except for being broke ;) I <br/>
*have* picked up some games second-hand to get more &quot;bits&quot;, although <br/>
there&#39;s no guarantee a used game won&#39;t be missing the exact same part <br/>
that we&#39;ve lost. I do a certain amount of validation when someone wants <br/>
to play a game or build and would like to have all the original pieces, <br/>
but its a fairly minor issue, here - maybe bc my kids are more used to <br/>
*not* having complete sets? Sorry I&#39;m not much help on that end.<br/>
