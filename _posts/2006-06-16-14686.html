<div id="ygrps-yiv-797437004">&quot;Is there a step where you are *liberated* enough inside of your head<br/>
to treat your children as they deserve to be, no matter how short<br/>
the night, how hot the weather, how stressed the mum ? Is there<br/>
something you can do to help getting over all these bad reactions<br/>
you might have without even thinking ?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m certainly not that mum!!:)  Let&#39;s face it, we&#39;re all affected by<br/>
moods, hormones, life changes, rough circumstances and just plain<br/>
annoying shit!:)<br/>
<br/>
BUT, a practice of mindfulness has helped me step back and sort of<br/>
&quot;disconnect&quot; from the intense emotions in many situations that would<br/>
have made me crazy years ago. As I trust my children to learn and grow<br/>
in their own way, it frees me to let go of MY expectations and simply<br/>
enjoy what IS.<br/>
<br/>
Breathing deep, observing my own reactions/emotions and reading from<br/>
other mindful Mums has really changed my life. An attitude that ALL of<br/>
my life is a choice, that I can approach activities with gratitude and<br/>
that each moment I live will never be again, helps me live for NOW.<br/>
<br/>
I look at my children and realize that they (or I) may die tomorrow. I<br/>
look around at my friends and all of the humans around me and realize<br/>
that all of us are just passing through. None of us will be here one<br/>
day. The complete fragility and preciousness of life causes me to LIVE<br/>
for the moment and take stock of what really matters.<br/>
<br/>
We just got back from the Lovejoy&#39;s house this afternoon. We were<br/>
saying goodbye to some of her crew that was heading to a big music<br/>
festival (Bonnaroo) and when I hugged Cameron (her 18y.o.) he said<br/>
&quot;hope I see you again&quot;. I laughed and said &quot;SOON!&quot; and he replied<br/>
something about &quot;you never know, I might not see you again&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He reminded me that EVERY goodbye could be our last. He reminded me to<br/>
really NOTICE the details around me and how beautiful it all is.<br/>
<br/>
Every day is a gift. If we can frame it in the very fragile light that<br/>
this life is, we will be more capable of not letting unimportant<br/>
annoyances bog us down.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also ok to accept those moods and feelings!! I get pissed. I get<br/>
cranky and I don&#39;t handle things great all the time. I&#39;ve decided to<br/>
not beat myself up over this any longer. My kids have leeway to screw<br/>
up and be supported unconditionally....I choose to give myself that<br/>
leeway too!! <br/>
<br/>
I warn people when I need some space, I communicate my own needs and<br/>
try to breathe and remember that this moment will pass and there is<br/>
always chocolate and paint.<br/>
There aren&#39;t many things in my life that chocolate or paint can&#39;t fix.:)<br/>
