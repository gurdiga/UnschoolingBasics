<div id="ygrps-yiv-808984295">While I didn&#39;t get the sense that the original poster was rushing anything, <br/>
it is an odd mix of behaviors when living with these g/t kids. Mine are prime <br/>
examples of bright one minute and you wonder where their heads were the next. <br/>
And DS is extremely tall -- so other people&#39;s expectations are skewed by that <br/>
too. <br/>
<br/>
OTOH, the mismatch with regular school activities and pace and content was <br/>
one of the reasons -- actually the main reason -- we started hsing.<br/>

This statement bothers me because I&#39;ve heard it so many times from parents<br/>
of gifted children.  Please don&#39;t forget that even if he acts 8 he is still<br/>
4 and has age 4 impulses and feelings.  Sometimes when we see our kids as<br/>
older than what they are we take away their childhood.  Don&#39;t rush it, he<br/>
sounds absolutely charming and I would hate to see him burning out and<br/>
feeling bad about himself.<br/>
