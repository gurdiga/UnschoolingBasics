<div id="ygrps-yiv-1838851832">well, I talked to my husband and mentioned that I wanted to try<br/>
unschooling our whole life.  I already am pretty relaxed, but I think<br/>

he didn&#39;t.  He thinks it&#39;ll be a disaster, but he&#39;s willing to let me<br/>

time?  If there is no bed time, what do you do when you need a break.<br/>
 By the end of the day, I&#39;m ready for my kids to go to bed.  The only<br/>

By the end of the day, I&#39;m ready for my kids to go to bed.<br/>
We all usually are watching some sort of TV or movie together at night, if my kids don&#39;t want to hang out with us then ,<br/>
My kids have TV&#39;s in their rooms, they go in there and watch either TV or a VCR tape or read ,...whatever as long as they stay quite. My youngest (6.5) is always the first to bed, when she gets tired she says good nite and gives kisses, even if we are all watching a good movie!<br/>
I don&#39;t remember how old you said your son was but if he wants to go somewhere he will/should be ready. I guess I would get a clock and show him the hands as to where on the clock the hands will be that he HAS to be ready or you wont make it on time. Tell him you want to go but if he&#39;s not dressed then you will both miss out. I think I would try something like that.<br/>
Good Luck,<br/>

Jayn rarely sleeps in pyjamas so is usually already in (wrinkled) clothes<br/>
the next morning, and sometimes goes out in pyjamas on those occasions that<br/>
she has actually slept in them. I end up bringing her other clothes to the<br/>
car fairly often, but it is still evidently different enough to be fun. One<br/>
thing that gets her moving on those dawdling times is simply reminding her<br/>
she need not go if she doesn&#39;t want to, but if she does want to be on time<br/>
we will have to go now. <br/>
<br/>
The only regularly scheduled event we have is Jayn&#39;s dance class. Nothing<br/>
else has a time attached, other than the rare dentist appointment or<br/>
similar. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think if you focus on them being in bed so you can relax that it will<br/>
contribute to your exhaustion. You&#39;ll be holding it all together to the<br/>
exhaustion point because you know you have a release point at bedtime.<br/>
<br/>
Find other ways to relax. Hire a teen or preteen to come in and play with<br/>
them so you can have an afternoon off once a week. Ask your husband to spend<br/>
an evening once a week with them so you can have an evening off.<br/>
<br/>
And I think a better way of expressing no bedtimes is no *set* bedtimes.<br/>
Bedtime comes when kids are tired rather than by the clock. Your goal is to<br/>
help them learn to recognize when they&#39;re tired so they&#39;ll decide to sleep<br/>
by their bodies. So when you notice signs of tiredness (which might be<br/>
getting wound up!) start winding down and doing relaxing bed ritual things.<br/>
Bath. Reading. Music in their room. TV in their room. SInging to them.<br/>
Massage oil. Whatever helps them.<br/>

ridiculous so she just slept in her clothes.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, getting kids ready is a hard task because there are *so* many things<br/>
that are way more interesting for them! And keep in mind that you wanting<br/>
him dressed is for *you* (and maybe society if he prefers au naturel ;-).<br/>
It&#39;s something you want. It&#39;s like wanting to take the time to make the<br/>
frosting on the cake beautiful when everyone else would be just as happy<br/>
with quick and messy and now :-) If you want something for you, do it for<br/>
you not because you expect anyone else to appreciate it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If it&#39;s somewhere &quot;early-ish&quot; (my kids both get up<br/>
between ten and noon), they will go to bed dressed in<br/>
what they&#39;re planning on wearing, and I will carry my<br/>
little one out to the car, and &quot;walk&quot; my big one out. <br/>
That way they get the maximum sleep AND still get to<br/>
go on outings that they are really looking forward to.<br/>
 Of course, bring a thermos of juice and a zone bar or<br/>
something for breakfast, and you&#39;re set!  And, NO<br/>
running around in the morning!  Magic!<br/>
