<div id="ygrps-yiv-857742247">Hi all,<br/>
Hope Spring is giving you great joy. I bought a new pair of shorts yeaterday! WooHoo!<br/>
I was asked by a girl I work with (college student) for information on not spanking for a debate she will be participating in. She told me that everyone in her study group agreed that spanking was ok and that they didn&#39;t know how to handle to &quot;con&quot; side of it.<br/>
:(<br/>
I told her, &quot;Boy, did you come to the right person! I&#39;ll find you tons of stuff!&quot;<br/>
So I have a few pages to give her but wanted your favorite links on the WHY of not spanking as well as what works better.<br/>
Incidentally, when I asked her why she thought spanking was a good tool, she couldn&#39;t really answer. She also tells me that she wasn&#39;t spanked although I&#39;m not sure that there were a whole lot better tools used in her family.<br/>
Thanks for your help.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1182657751">She obviously hasn&#39;t visited many parenting forums, <br/>
<br/>
I highly doubt she has, she&#39;s a 21 year old college student who is not even close to thinking about kids.<br/>
I kind of think of this as a good opportunity to show alternatives to younger people, who knows where they&#39;ll take it?<br/>
So far I have articles from Joyce&#39;s page, the AAofP&#39;s policy on spanking and a few others. I don&#39;t want to be too radical, mostly mainstreamish pages on the alternatives.<br/>
I also plan on talking to her a bit about my own viewpoint, as an adult who was spanked and the continuing repurcussions of it.<br/>

of the NoMoreSpanking list are chock full of &quot;why not&quot; and &quot;what  <br/>
else&quot; ideas:<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was about the straightest arrow good kid you could find.  I have <br/>
two older brothers, ya see, and didn&#39;t need to do the stuff, since <br/>
they already had... and we all got yelled at for it.<br/>
<br/>
My dh once asked me if I was ever spanked.  I said, yes.  He asked <br/>
what I did.  My reply was that I don&#39;t know, I guess my folks had a <br/>
bad day.<br/>
<br/>
It is the truth.  But my hubby thought it was hilarious.  He told my <br/>
parents this, and when he got to the part he thought was funny, they, <br/>
in a serious tone, said, &quot;She&#39;s probably right.&quot;  All I remember is <br/>
that I didn&#39;t like it, not what it was related to.<br/>
<br/>
My son has never been spanked, is 14, and the nicest kid you could <br/>
want to meet.  If I had spanked him, I suspect he would be the sullen <br/>
teen in a previous post....  Think about what spanking is telling a <br/>
kid -- &quot;It&#39;s okay to hit someone who is littler than you.&quot;  That&#39;s <br/>
the message.  Then ask, is that what I want my child to learn?<br/>
