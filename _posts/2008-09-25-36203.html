<div id="ygrps-yiv-1348864107">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
My twelve yo has been campaigning for an airsoft gun for a few weeks<br/>
now. I am very uncomfortable about guns, I grew up in N Ireland with a<br/>
strong military presence on the streets daily, shootings,<br/>
knee-cappings on the news, armed checkpoints etc.<br/>
<br/>
So that is my personal experience, we live in a built up area with a<br/>
small yard, there are sometimes kids with pellet or beebee guns<br/>
walking around shooting birds dead on the street, a neighbouring town<br/>
is trying to get them banned.<br/>
<br/>
What interested my son is when we were on vacation way in the country<br/>
and homeschool friends had airsofts in the woods and shooting targets.<br/>
There was no targeting small animals there, round here is a big<br/>
hunting mentality and plenty of cruelty to dogs, cats, etc.<br/>
<br/>
My first reaction is to say no. Can someone suggest an activity where<br/>
there is the fun of target practice, maybe something safe for the yard<br/>
or park, without the gun. Or a link to a product that shoots but is<br/>
not fashioned like an actual gun?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-16827227">With four boys in the house, we have airsoft too.  I didn&#39;t know there was a catch for indoor use.  I know that when I pull sheets out of the linen closet, there are hundreds of little balls that fall on the floor!  LOL!<br/>
I&#39;ve sent the boys outside and they have taped pre-printed paper targets to the trees for shooting practice.  <br/>

He&#39;s interested in a gun though right? This feels like you&#39;re setting<br/>
it up for a power struggle. Your experiences don&#39;t need to be his<br/>
baggage. You can share with him why real guns bother you, but he<br/>
doesn&#39;t need to feel guilt about being fascinated with weaponry.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re big airsoft gun lovers though. I plan to buy one for myself<br/>
eventually. The kids have had a ball with them. THey&#39;re intelligent<br/>
human beings that know the difference between a real gun and a toy.<br/>
None of my children would intentionally want to harm someone with a<br/>
real weapon.<br/>

That reminds me of my friend, Susan, who wanted a horse.<br/>
<br/>
Her parents got her hamsters, a rabbit, two cats, and a dog in order to <br/>
keep her &quot;happy enough.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Had they just gone ahead and bought the HORSE, imagine how happy <br/>
*everyone* could have been. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The hamsters died. The horse went with Susan to college. The rabbit, <br/>
the cats, and the dog belonged to the *parents* for YEARS. &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1926954884">Hi Cara--<br/>
I have a 9 yr old who loves the airsoft guns. And I had big<br/>
reservations about getting him one too. But now he has a couple<br/>
different styles. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, some things that helped me:<br/>
I would totally prefer my son to learn the safe way to handle guns of<br/>
any kind with my support than without it. He&#39;s not one to go behind my<br/>
back, but he has no reason to. And I&#39;d bet the kids going around your<br/>
neighborhood shooting birds and pets don&#39;t have the support of a<br/>
loving grown-up. <br/>
<br/>
My son recently joined a &quot;shooting sports&quot; club (through 4H, if your<br/>
in the U.S.) so that he can dive deeper into his love of guns and bows<br/>
and arrows. All the parents participate and are very involved with<br/>
helping their kids be safe and responsible. There will be shooting<br/>
practice at a shooting range and everyone gets a chance to make their<br/>
own bow and arrows if they want. It&#39;s very cool and <br/>
<br/>
our life would look very different if I had just said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry--I<br/>
hate guns and the death and murder that happens with them and you<br/>
can&#39;t have an airsoft right now.&quot; Do I still get uncomfortable with<br/>
guns? Yes, sometimes. And my son knows this. My fears and past are not<br/>
my son&#39;s problem. Do I say I hate guns anymore? No. I&#39;ve grown. I know<br/>
the difference between safe and responsible gun handling and hideous<br/>
crimes. I still get afraid, but I&#39;m learning how empowering it is for<br/>
me to learn about something I used to fear. <br/>
<br/>
I would strongly encourage you to be open to your son and find a way<br/>
to say &quot;yes&quot; for the airsoft gun. It would be an awesome way to show<br/>
your son that you trust him. And researching places for him to go<br/>
about using it safely can give him some guidance. And you&#39;ll learn a<br/>
whole lot. You&#39;ll be a team with it. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a &quot;Here&#39;s your new gun! See you at dinner time, honey.&quot;<br/>
There&#39;s all sorts of ways to go about getting both your needs met--you<br/>
want safety (I&#39;m guessing) and he wants a gun. There are many ways to<br/>
say yes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-262942171">How about making your own targets? Seems like your fear is of causing unnecessary pain to animals, so maybe having fun making your own cool, hand-painted/spray-painted/fabric  targets would help focus on the fun of shooting? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1551989353">I am not really an unschooler (more of a trainee unschooler!!) but had<br/>
a few practical ideas for you if that is okay?  <br/>
<br/>
is it possible that the fun your son had on holiday was not about the<br/>
rifle, but about all that outdoor fun and adventure he had with his<br/>
friends?  He might not know how to distinguish the two very well.<br/>
<br/>
I do think though that if he really does want an airgun then it is<br/>
unlikely that anything else will work for him.  Although maybe you cld<br/>
still talk it through with him and see if this really is the case?<br/>
<br/>
If it really is the airgun thing that he wants, then for me, I would<br/>
feel a whole lot happier looking at the whole thing from the<br/>
perspective that it is a sport, which is exactly what your son<br/>
experienced when he was on holiday.  It doesn&#39;t need to be something<br/>
cruel or violent, and it certainly doesn&#39;t sound as if that is what<br/>
has appealed to your son.<br/>
<br/>
Just because all kind of stuff is going on outside your door, it<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean that your son is going to do the same.  Especially if you<br/>
can meet his wishes in a way that makes both of you feel happy if you<br/>
see what I mean.<br/>
<br/>
I guess you are in America?  I have no idea what goes on over there,<br/>
but rather than hanging round with local kids shooting birds, could<br/>
you track down a teens sports shooting club?  Paintball type clubs or<br/>
target practice etc?  can you think of any other families/relatives<br/>
etc who might feel the same way as you and whose children would love<br/>
to meet up once a month in the woods for proper airsoft games?<br/>
<br/>
I would feel similarly about guns, but I don&#39;t feel so uneasy about<br/>
bows and arrows and swords.  I can&#39;t quite place why, maybe guns ARE a<br/>
world apart from some other kinds of play, or maybe it&#39;s just in our<br/>
own imaginations and coloured by our own lives?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to waffle on.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes.</div>
