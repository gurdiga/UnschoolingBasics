<div id="ygrps-yiv-300391495">Just needed to share.<br/>
Tonight my dad and I went shopping to look for birthday presents for my oldest, he&#39;ll be <br/>
eleven next week. Somehow the conversation got around to how children learn and what <br/>
we&#39;re doing as far as &#39;homeschooling&#39; was going, (Oh yes, my stepmom&#39;s concern at our lack <br/>
of program....that was it)<br/>
<br/>
He is still not convinced...he agrees that kids learn better when they are interested, he agrees <br/>
that public schools aren&#39;t the best place to learn, but cannot let go of the perceived fact that <br/>
you need to force kids to learn what they should know.<br/>
<br/>
The best thing is that the longer we talked about it, the more certain I felt of myself and how <br/>
things are going. I told him to not expect any change in our lifestyle any time soon, we&#39;re <br/>
happier than we&#39;ve ever been, he KNOWS this is true. He just cannot trust that kids will learn <br/>
what they need to know. :-( I had hoped for his support, and while he won&#39;t butt in like my <br/>
ma, just knowing he&#39;s not behind me makes me sad. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for listening,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2074813732">Hi Melissa...<br/>
<br/>
I can imagine it must be hard to not have your parents behind your <br/>
decision to unschool. You say he agrees that kids learn best when <br/>
they&#39;re interested and that public school is not the best place to <br/>
learn. That&#39;s great! He may never get it 100%, but as long as he <br/>
respects your choices, all is good. <br/>
That&#39;s great that your conversation did a lot to reassure you. I <br/>
find that myself also. Talking to other people about my choices <br/>
(whether it&#39;s homeschooling, unschooling or adopting older kids) <br/>
somehow helps me process my thoughts also. <br/>
<br/>
Hang in there!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It can be wearying to have family not be supportive. Let the joy of<br/>
your days with your children boost you!:)<br/>
And just remember what Kelly always says &quot;the proof is in the<br/>
pudding&quot;....know that your Dad will be seeing these interesting,<br/>
bubbly and intelligent kids in a few years and start to come around<br/>
(very likely) if he&#39;s at least not outright AGAINST unschooling right now.<br/>
<br/>
I had some exhausting conversations with my folks early on. But we&#39;ve<br/>
been bucking the system for long enough now, that I do have family<br/>
support.  Before my Mom died, she was one of our biggest and loudest<br/>
advocates and My Dad and stepmom even came to a day of the Live and<br/>
Learn conference! You just never know. Time does amazing things.<br/>

Before I looked to see who wrote this I thought &quot;Wow, that sounds like <br/>
my story.&quot;  Duh, it is my story since we have the same parents!!<br/>
