<div id="ygrps-yiv-239551506">This is off-topic in terms of making unschooling work, but it does relate to having a joyful, unschooling lifestyle.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have the game version of The Way Things Work?  I&#39;ve seen it in a catalog (www.mindwareonline.com) and I think it looks like a lot of fascinating fun, but my husband is concerned that it won&#39;t be very sturdy.  My oldest son&#39;s 11th birthday is coming up in a few weeks and the grandparents want gift suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Katharine<br/>
