<div id="ygrps-yiv-982452481">I&#39;m sorry my other post was lost---oh but I do<br/>
remember writing that I&#39;ll do just about anything to<br/>
get you lurkers out of lurkdom---including scrubbing<br/>
dogs&#39; butts!! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
*+*+*+*+*+<br/>
<br/>
LOL!!  Kelly and Alex....thank you both so much for<br/>
the great information.  Alex, I never would have<br/>
thought about the kennel club.  Great idea!  Kelly, I<br/>
know how you feel.  I was just replying with an intro<br/>
and *!POOF!* my browser closed and I lost it. <br/>
Blah...I can&#39;t quite remember what I had said about<br/>
lurking now.  But, to defend lurking, it&#39;s a great way<br/>
to get to know everyone and to absorb the information<br/>
that&#39;s flying by. (for me at least)  I&#39;ve learned so<br/>
much here and at UD, unschooling.com (when it was<br/>
up)unschooling.info, and, well, you know all the<br/>
sites.<br/>
<br/>
Ok..I guess it&#39;s intro time...should I put in a<br/>
disclaimer now about how long this could be. &lt;g&gt;  I<br/>
think I really need to start working on a blog. <br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m a mom of 5 kids:  Tony (21) Donnie (20)<br/>
Brittani (17) Sara (15) Hope (10).  Yep...busy house. <br/>
Caretaker to 5 mice, 4 cats, 2 dogs and 2 birds. <br/>
Yep...messy house. Wife to John.  Yep...happy house.<br/>
;)  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve known about unschooling for a number of years<br/>
now, but the journey began just this year, in<br/>
February.  You see, back when Tony was in 8th grade he<br/>
wanted to commit suicide because all the kids made fun<br/>
of him, bullied him and just didn&#39;t like him.  He was<br/>
shy, quiet and emotional.  He was ripe for the pickin&#39;<br/>
on, so to speak.  Tony was Baker Acted at the tender<br/>
age of 12 because he told his youth group leader about<br/>
his thoughts on suicide.  After he came home, he<br/>
opened up to me about his feelings and the healing<br/>
ALMOST began.<br/>
<br/>
Donnie on the other hand was the outgoing, social one.<br/>
 He was at school for the friends and fun.  He kissed<br/>
every administrator and teacher ass on campus.  They<br/>
all loved him!  He skipped classes, but was at school<br/>
every day.  Had decent grades too.  His story is that<br/>
he got shafted by the school system for missing too<br/>
many days in 8th grade summer school due to a serious<br/>
bronchial infection.  (He had already been retained in<br/>
7th grade for his behavior.)  Meanwhile, there was<br/>
another boy in a different school that missed more<br/>
days than him and was promoted.  It seems that the<br/>
individual schools can make up their own rules about<br/>
attendance.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I have never been happy with the public school<br/>
system, even when I went to school, so I began<br/>
researching homeschooling.  Of course unschooling came<br/>
up in my research.  OMG! I couldn&#39;t believe it, here<br/>
it was NATURAL LEARNING.   Now, I knew that the family<br/>
(John, mom, dad, brother, in-laws, etc.) would never<br/>
go for the unschooling.  They had fits about me<br/>
nursing my kids past the age of 9 mos.&lt;g&gt;  So, I<br/>
gathered all sorts of information about homeschooling<br/>
WITH a cirriculum and presented my case to the family.<br/>
 OUCH!!  What resistance I met with.  They went<br/>
ballistic on me with the two typical concerns: <br/>
Socialization and Math.  Unfortunately they<br/>
outnumbered me and my campaign failed miserably.  I<br/>
gave in and kept the boys in school.  I was always the<br/>
good girl.  I always did what I was told. <br/>
Muhahaha...not anymore. ;p<br/>
<br/>
As the boys were in school, I developed a new<br/>
campaign.  I just waited until they were 16 and<br/>
withdrew them from school.  Yes...there were many,<br/>
many fights and arguments between John and I over<br/>
attendance, homework and their friends (ps kids). <br/>
Finally their birthdays came and I gave them the best<br/>
birthday presents ever.  I withdrew them from school. <br/>
When I went to withdraw Donnie, they had the paperwork<br/>
all filled out and ready for my signature..LOL!!  Now<br/>
came the time for the real battle to ensue.<br/>
<br/>
After I withdrew the boys, John started saying things<br/>
along the lines of &quot;the girls won&#39;t be &quot;dropouts&quot; like<br/>
the boys&quot; and &quot;they are going to college because *I*<br/>
want them to&quot;.  OH! Also, that their friends won&#39;t be<br/>
using drugs and having sex.  (LOL!!! He&#39;s a pistol,<br/>
ain&#39;t he.  Of course, now he realizes how insane he<br/>
sounded back then. &lt;g&gt;)  <br/>
<br/>
Well, the girls didn&#39;t fair any better in school. <br/>
Just a couple of incidents:  Sara beat the crap out of<br/>
two boys who were pulling on her backpack and hair on<br/>
her way home from school one day.  Brittani had some<br/>
girls try to jump her for liking a certain boy.  Hope<br/>
was teased mercilessly about her name.  Finally, I had<br/>
enough!!  None of them wanted to go to school.  They<br/>
were miserable.  Plus with this No Child Left Behind<br/>
crap, school was becoming worse.  All they care about<br/>
is testing.  Recess even became obsolete in Hope&#39;s<br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t care what anybody thought or said and<br/>
withdrew them from school.  I blew up John&#39;s email<br/>
with forwarded posts from these groups, I printed<br/>
stuff out and left it in the bathroom, I talked until<br/>
I was blue in the face about unschooling.  And I&#39;m<br/>
still talking about it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As far as the extended family is concerned, mom and<br/>
dad are pretty much ok with it.  Mom sees the<br/>
difference.  I did received a threat from my SIL that<br/>
she would never speak to me again if I took the girls<br/>
out of school.  Funny...cuz she&#39;s hosting Thanksgiving<br/>
and I&#39;m hosting Xmas this year. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
All the kids are doing great.  Tony is still working<br/>
at the trophy shop he started at when he was 10.  (The<br/>
owner has no kids and will be passing the shop to<br/>
Tony.)  Donnie is in his 3rd year electrical<br/>
apprenticeship.  (He&#39;s been playing with electricity<br/>
since he was 4) Brittani and Sara are hanging out with<br/>
their friends and finding their passions.  Hope is<br/>
animal crazy and loving her new free life.<br/>
<br/>
Ok..now that I&#39;ve bored you all to death, I&#39;ll close<br/>
with a big thank you to all of you for your wonderful<br/>
advice and insight.  I love being part of this group<br/>
an look forward to learning even MORE!!<br/>
<br/>
