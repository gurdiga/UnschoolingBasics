<div id="ygrps-yiv-1773182417">Hi everyone!<br/>
so much of my unschooling journey in the last two years has been inspired by this list. Before I went out and found people in the area, this group was my way to relax and learn, and truly felt like having a good and inspiring time with friends. <br/>
Even now, that we have made many friends in the area, I still go to this group for inspiration and to check in from time to time. Now I have felt the wish to document some of our journey in the unschooling lifestyle and since Unschooling Basics has been so paramount in this process I would love to have a chance to meet - and possibly interview and film - people on this list that will be at the Live and Learn conference. I have looked at the schedule, and for me either thursday morning after 10:30 before lunch or friday morning after 10:00 would work for me.<br/>
From what I can gather it seems that Heaton Hall, 1st floor is mostly available. Please let me know if anyone would love to meet and participate -<br/>
From what I understand, Kelly, you started this conference also in the wish to meet people from this list?<br/>
Some of you know that I will be filming some footage in the hopes of showing it on German TV in combination with a lot of filming on the German homeschooling movement. For this particular shoot I mostly like to interview young people, and hope to find them around. <br/>
In addition to that I would love to make an inspiring and fun short movie on Unschooling Basics, the online group, it&#39;s stor, as well as the concepts, so any and all participation in this is highly welcome!!!<br/>
A lot of you guys are probably on the road already, I will be hopefully posting a meeting somewhere.<br/>
All the best,<br/>
Mara<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If I don&#39;t have anything else going, Friday morning would work better<br/>
for me. I am driving my oldest son&#39;s gf into her college on Thursday<br/>
around 1pm, so Thurs. would work too but I might feel more rushed.<br/>
She&#39;s got a class she can&#39;t miss (and is finding the whole thing<br/>
ironic).:)<br/>
<br/>
~~ For this particular shoot I mostly like to interview young people,<br/>

<br/>
I can probably grab George and Trevor. George is in college and she&#39;s<br/>
an always home/unschooled teen. Trevor has no desire for college on<br/>
the other hand.;)<br/>
<br/>
As far as Kelly developing the conference because of a desire to meet<br/>
people from the lists...this one didn&#39;t exist at that time!:) We had<br/>
all been talking mostly on Unschooling dotcom message board, which no<br/>
longer exists. It was eight years ago in they ear 2000. Kelly and I<br/>
were both newer to unschooling, though she was leaving a private<br/>
school and I had been eclectic/relaxed homeschooling for all my<br/>
children&#39;s lives other than Trevor trying kindergarten.<br/>
<br/>
So.....a lot of the orignal people we found at the message board are<br/>
still with us at this list. There have been a lot of newer folks from<br/>
this list come out to the conference also! And sometimes it&#39;s worked<br/>
the other way around...someone hears about the list at a conference<br/>
and joins.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra Dodd was a key figure at the unschooling dotcom message board,<br/>
and several of us learned a lot from her lists she started. She and<br/>
Joyce Fetteroll and Pam Sorooshian and Deb Lewis and Rue Kream (am I<br/>
forgetting anyone?) were some of the key people who influenced both<br/>
Kelly and I in our early journey.<br/>

 <br/>
Those two would be great, and maybe they know some others as well.<br/>
Maybe we can do just some short planning on thursday, and you could introduce me to Trevor and George and friends and then I will do the interview with you mostly on friday - are there any locations nearby that truly inspire you that we could go to?<br/>

<br/>
Are any of these people going to be there at the conference? What I gather is that the Internet and the ability to converse with people on certain subjects is a key instrument in really changing peoples lives. <br/>

Pam, Joyce...are you coming? I know Deb and Sandra won&#39;t be there this<br/>
year. <br/>
Rue will be coming but their plans got changed due to a death in the<br/>
family. They&#39;ll get there on Saturday instead now. They&#39;ll be staying<br/>
for Sun./Mon. hanging out in Asheville though.<br/>

We took a two-week trip to NYC this year (from Southern California) -  <br/>
and it wiped us out, financially. If there was any way I could afford  <br/>
it - Rosie and I, at least, would be there! I can&#39;t express how sorry  <br/>
we are to be missing it. About once an hour I&#39;m looking at air fares  <br/>
and thinking....maybe....maybe...., but - no.<br/>

Earlier, when I was deciding, I thought I had reasons I wouldn&#39;t come <br/>
to the conference but those reasons died or moved away and I might now <br/>
have been able to arrange it if I hadn&#39;t spent a trillion dollars on <br/>
our vacation in Oregon. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
I would have loved to come, to hear the speakers, and meet Ren (because <br/>
I have only met Flat Ren) and to see Kelly again.  Kelly whom I love <br/>
and adore and dream about at night... <br/>
<br/>
But being at a conference makes me want to vomit and hide, so no one&#39;s <br/>
missing a thing if I&#39;m not there, except, maybe, really messy shoes. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
I hope you all have fun.  I hope no one vomits on you.<br/>

YOu can vomit on me Deb! <br/>
Well dang....lots of &quot;old timers&quot; are missing this year. Wah.<br/>
<br/>
The cool part for me personally though, FOUR families from right here<br/>
locally are coming. I have the most amazing local network!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll miss you all!!<br/>
