<div id="ygrps-yiv-1882424661">Hi, I&#39;m Sam and am new to this particular group.  My wife and I have<br/>
two boys ages 7 and 2.5 that we are unschooling.  Mostly she works<br/>
while I mess around on the computer and play video games with the<br/>
boys.  It seems to work, but she really should be jealous.<br/>
We aren&#39;t really new to homeschooling as we&#39;ve always (since we&#39;ve had<br/>
kids) planned to homeschool.  We are also very familiar with<br/>
unschooling, but we are new to a lot of parenting practices that we<br/>
are working to implement.  We are working on issues of yelling,<br/>
limits/control and generally finding ways to be more respectful as a<br/>
family.<br/>
My goals are to be the best father I can both for my boys, my wife and<br/>
myself.  As I&#39;m getting better at being a better dad, I&#39;m enjoying<br/>
life in general a little more.  Each day, though not always easier, is<br/>
a little happier than the last.<br/>
I think that&#39;s probably enough intro for now.  I just heard the words,<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m hungry,&quot; meaning I should be moving my rear parts toward the kitchen.<br/>
I look forward to meeting everyone!</div>

&quot;Just today I&#39;m going to be utterly present for my children, I&#39;m going to be in their world (not just doing my own thing while they do theirs), I&#39;m going to really hear them, I&#39;m going to prepare myself to be present starting right now.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Welcome!  I can relate to so much of what you have written.  This is a great place to help you evaluate everything you do and to determine if it really fits the goals you descried.  Like you I am so much more happy as a person.  Welcome, again.<br/>
<br/>
Love<br/>
Tyra<br/>
