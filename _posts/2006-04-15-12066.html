<div id="ygrps-yiv-1828395277">Ok, I started to post this story earlier to the mother, sorry I&#39;ve forgotten<br/>
who now, was talking about her ds who hates workbooks, and doesn&#39;t like to<br/>
practice handwriting.  In light of some of the later posts that I&#39;ve finally<br/>
gotten to almost a week later I&#39;ve decided maybe someone will come to the<br/>
realization that I did.<br/>
<br/>
First, a little on my background.  I taught 4-6 grade deaf education, that<br/>
means I taught kids who are deaf in all subject areas, for nearly 8 years.<br/>
Three of those years were spent teaching multi-handicapped (MH) deaf, the<br/>
same basic kids (adding and subtracting a few who graduated on to jr. high<br/>
due to their age) for all 3 years.  There was no curriculum so I developed<br/>
my own thematic units.  The kids came to me from a teacher who never really<br/>
taught the kids, just assumed b/c they were MH they couldn&#39;t read or write.<br/>
I had a different philosophy and was able to teach children in one year more<br/>
than they&#39;d been able to do in her class after three.  For example, I<br/>
remember her bursting into my classroom to brag about how she finally got<br/>
one of the students to write her name.  The following year in my class that<br/>
child learned to read and write at least 50 words.  Including her first and<br/>
last name, her mother&#39;s name and her address.  Sorry I&#39;m rambling so I&#39;ll go<br/>
on.  After my third year there I moved to another school out of frustration.<br/>
Frustration of having deaf kids who signed in a school where there were no<br/>
other kids that signed to be their role model.  We were in the only school<br/>
in the district with an oral program for the deaf when there were two other<br/>
schools with other sign language deaf ed. programs.  Which also meant no<br/>
interpreters for my students while they were in art and p.e.  So, anyway<br/>
when I moved to one of the other sign language deaf ed. programs that was<br/>
supposedly kids who were &quot;normal&quot; except for deafness I found that the kids<br/>
were only about a hair higher than the kids I&#39;d been teaching but now I had<br/>
a curriculum to follow.  For fifth grade they were supposed to learn<br/>
American History and improve their cursive.  Some of these kids couldn&#39;t<br/>
even name all the months of the year, and none of them could read any higher<br/>
than first grade.  (This is b/c sadly most of their parents couldn&#39;t<br/>
communicate with them more than just pointing to things and gesturing, but<br/>
that&#39;s another story).  To get to my point the year before I left we all<br/>
decided to take this new reading academy (the new trend for the year).  It<br/>
actually made some good points.  Afterwards the fourth grade deaf ed teacher<br/>
said to me, &quot;why are we teaching cursive to kids who can&#39;t read print,<br/>
especially when some of the kids don&#39;t have legible print handwriting?&quot;  He<br/>
then went on to talk about how through the academy he was doing things with<br/>
the students that pre-schoolers do and how much they loved it.  &quot;It&#39;s like<br/>
they missed that part of their life b/c they had no communication at that<br/>
point.&quot;  One of the students, a very tough Hispanic 12 yo boy even mentioned<br/>
how much he&#39;d like to have a red wagon and play in the sand box.  Sound<br/>
familiar to those of you with toddlers.  Sometimes when I read these posts<br/>
about deschooling especially the concerns about handwriting, etc. I think<br/>
about this discussion I had with a fellow teacher and how off base the<br/>
instruction was for the kids just b/c they were 11 and 12 yo.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I also wanted to mention that I myself also have terrible handwriting as a<br/>
child my mother, a lefty, thought it would be better for me to be right<br/>
handed person so every time I&#39;d pick up something with my left hand she&#39;d<br/>
put it in my right.  By the time I was in the 5th grade my handwriting was<br/>
so bad she told me about doing this and actually suggested that I re-learn<br/>
to write with my left hand.  I never did, I just have terrible handwriting<br/>
and try not to write if possible.  Maybe one day I will practice, but it&#39;s<br/>
just not important now.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the long rambling.<br/>
