<div id="ygrps-yiv-1686526663">&quot;They have a set bedtime, we eat meals and<br/>
snacks at predictable times, and DH takes over the TV at the same <br/>
time every<br/>
day.  I call that a daily order, some might call it structure.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I call it control. (well, maybe...I&#39;d need more information first)<br/>
Now eating meals at predictable times might just be a natural rhythm <br/>
in your family, but we&#39;ve found that we all get hungry at different <br/>
times and have different needs for food intake. So there are <br/>
predictable times that I&#39;m fixing food throughout the day, but we <br/>
all might not be hungry at that moment. And someone is always <br/>
needing a snack when I&#39;m not fixing food, so I help them find <br/>
something.<br/>
We have some predictability, yes. But it&#39;s not decided by the adults <br/>
in the home. It&#39;s simply a natural flow of everyone getting their <br/>
needs met.<br/>
<br/>
There are set times that people are USUALLY tired around here, but <br/>
it varies a lot. I don&#39;t decide a bedtime for anyone but myself. My <br/>
two younger children go to bed when I do, so that&#39;s pretty <br/>
predictable.<br/>
I don&#39;t have an arbitrary time I put people to bed though. We sleep <br/>
when we get tired.<br/>
<br/>
My older boys usually stay up later than anyone, but last night they <br/>
were asleep (with a friend spending the night) by 9:30pm!! Highly <br/>
unusual. They had played paintball all day though, so they were <br/>
exhausted. If I had a set bedtime, I guarantee you they&#39;d be staying <br/>
up until that set time and ignoring the needs of their body.<br/>
They have no fascination with staying up late though, so going to <br/>
bed early just made sense last night.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you find the list a useful place to question just how parents <br/>
are able to give children these choices without having chaos in <br/>
their homes, how unschooling unfolds better in these conditions and <br/>
how people arrived at these various places in their journey to <br/>
unschooling.:)<br/>
<br/>
Welcome.<br/>
