<div id="ygrps-yiv-1433822740">Thanks for all the ides everyone.  Some might work and some I wish would work.  We have been thinking about a rock wall ( I would love to see your pictures Danielle, I&#39;ve seen the ones of the outside wall) and mini trampoline already and sounds like they would be good.  We might do a video game system next year and will look into  mat.  I looked into the ikea hand rings and they do not ship them via internet, but I love the idea.  I think a ladder on the ceiling would be fantastic, but completely undoable with this house.  We do not have a flat piece of ground for a big trampoline and I&#39;ve heard it will often void home-owners insurance, be sure to check.  We already ride bikes, scooters, and roller skates in the basement.  I&#39;m trying to mentally set up an obstacle course so I will have ideas.  Next time I&#39;m out we will chack for carpet skates.  I&#39;ve kept all the suggestions and will try them all out.<br/>
 <br/>
 Thanks,<br/>

 So if you think your kids would enjoy the dancing, but aren&#39;t ready<br/>
to invest in a game system, there are PC versions of these games.<br/>
