<div id="ygrps-yiv-1863691619">I just wanted to share this dream, it&#39;s not really offtopic, but it&#39;s  <br/>
taken me a few days to get the point where I feel I should share it.  <br/>
I have a lot of dreams, several every night. Some are pretty much  <br/>
instantly recognizable as &#39;junk mail&#39;, but most are messages.<br/>
<br/>
In this dream, my kids and I were walking through a  <br/>
wasteland...obviously some end-of-world type of thing. We were  <br/>
scavenging for survival stuff, food, clothes, the little ones were  <br/>
picking up toys and such. Josh and I were finding books, keeping them  <br/>
because we love to read and we were going to rebuild the library.<br/>
<br/>
One book he picked up was a saxon algebra book, in fact, it was the  <br/>
one he bought for himself at a curriculum sale we attended recently.  <br/>
(He&#39;s got the knowledge base for it, and is curious, but mostly wants  <br/>
to do it, I think, to prove that he can. Although he did the first  <br/>
few chapters by himself and hasn&#39;t touched it since) We walked for  <br/>
miles and miles, balancing everything. Josh had the most trouble  <br/>
though, because he couldn&#39;t balance that one book. Finally I grabbed  <br/>
it from him and threw it over the edge of a cliff! He was shocked,  <br/>
but I just said, &quot;you know, it doesn&#39;t matter anymore....it&#39;s okay to  <br/>
let it go. In our new life, we have to just realize that some things  <br/>
aren&#39;t as important as they used to be&quot; We ran over to the cliff to  <br/>
see what had happened to it, and it was miles below, in a crevasse  <br/>
FULL of old math books.<br/>
<br/>
I just woke up, amazed that I was not able to process that while  <br/>
awake. But I really feel like I&#39;m taking a huge step internally. Even  <br/>
though we&#39;ve been living this for a while, obviously I was still  <br/>
having issues.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just wanted to share.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1130330513">Thanks for sharing your dream Melissa. I remember my pivotal unschooling dream. It started out like a regular scholl panic dream. I was in school, unprepared, looking for classes I had forgotten I signed up for, taking tests I knew nothing about. I used to have those any time i was stressed in real life. <br/>
<br/>
Only this time I stopped in the middle of the dream and said &quot;wait I forgot, none of this matters.&quot; It was sooooo freeing. I remember waking up so relaxed. I haven&#39;t had a school dream since.<br/>

green earth, dwelling deeply in the present moment and feeling truly<br/>
alive.&quot;<br/>
