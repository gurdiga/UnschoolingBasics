<div id="ygrps-yiv-1611580611">Ok, I&#39;m feelin&#39; pretty crummy right now.  Didn&#39;t mean to give such <br/>
apparently misguided advice!  As I said, I&#39;m still working on <br/>
transitioning to an unschooling way of thinking, so give me a break, <br/>
please!  <br/>
<br/>
I do understand what you mean about forcing the writing issue, so <br/>
thanks to the constructive advice that was given.  She&#39;s 8 now and I <br/>
want her to be writing more, in truth.  Any ways to encourage this, <br/>
unschooling-wise, without being such a meany mommy?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Two questions: writing what? does she want to be writing more? By what <br/>
I mean are you concerned with the physical mechanics of putting <br/>
implement to paper or are you concerned with the creative aspect of <br/>
stringing together words to communicate ideas? Why exactly is writing <br/>
more at age 8 important to you? (as opposed to say 7 or 9 or 12) I&#39;ve <br/>
got an 8 1/2 year old who has stories and game ideas and all sorts of <br/>
stuff bubbling in his brain all the time. But, unless he wants it <br/>
written down, it just is verbal communication (very clear and <br/>
descriptive and imaginative verbal communication too). Sometimes he <br/>
asks me to take dictation if he wants to keep an idea. So I do. If the <br/>
story telling communicating side is what you are wanting, maybe ask if <br/>
you can write it down when your DD starts describing or telling a <br/>
story or whatever. Otherwise, work on your own insides first - why <br/>
this is so important to you for her right now at age 8. Maybe even do <br/>
some writing on your own (if it&#39;s that important, I&#39;m guessing you <br/>
write creatively, journal, whatever, in your own life on a regular <br/>
basis - if not, why is it critical for her life at 8 yrs old but not <br/>
yours)<br/>
