<div id="ygrps-yiv-318768677">Hi I am new to the list- mom to Emily (13) Jasmine (4) and |Theo (4 <br/>
months) living in a little UK village.<br/>
<br/>
I really want to do unschooling, to live an unschooling life, but my <br/>
eldest has reservations. We have tried nearly all the different home <br/>
school methods over the past 5 1/2 yrs and they always start off <br/>
well then lead to resistance. i love the idea of unschooling and <br/>
think it is the only way to go.<br/>
<br/>
When I asked my dd about her reservations, she informed me that yes <br/>
it may be fun until she becomes 16, and is then unable to go to <br/>
college becasue she hasn&#39;t done her GCSE&#39;s (UK qualification most <br/>
colleges ask for) She is afraid she will end up stupid, doing a job <br/>
that she hates and said it will be because she didn&#39;t laern anything <br/>
(think she means academics)when she was younger.<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of &#39;shoulds&#39; and &#39;meant to do&#39; &#39;at her level&#39; in her <br/>
speech probably from dh who believes it is our job to challenge and <br/>
stretch her. Dh also believe unschooling is better for those who are <br/>
artistic based and not academic based!! grrrrrrrrrr<br/>
<br/>
How can I help her see unschooling can be what she wants it to, that <br/>
she can do anything and life can continue to be fun- becaaue I <br/>
believe it can and there are always choices, and that you don&#39;t have <br/>
to take a job you ahte and you don&#39;t have to go to college because <br/>
all your friends are (she doesn&#39;t want to play catch up) But there <br/>
is a lot of comparison to her peers how they are going to <br/>
college...it&#39;s like she doesn&#39;t know who she is and what she wants <br/>
to do..<br/>
<br/>
Amanda<br/>
Any ideas where to go with this?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-900623287">Unschooling isn&#39;t about *not* learning academics, it&#39;s<br/>
about learning what&#39;s important to her--so obviously,<br/>
if that&#39;s important to her, she will choose to learn<br/>
it.  Unschooling just means you can no longer harp on<br/>
her to do her work ;)  Tell her it&#39;s the best of both<br/>
worlds!  I don&#39;t know anything about the UK, but I<br/>
have a 12 yo here, who&#39;s never been to school, never<br/>
had an assignment.  She looks at possibilities in<br/>
life, not limits.  She knows she can do whatever she<br/>
wants, now and in the future.  Your daughter doesn&#39;t<br/>
have to &quot;agree&quot; to unschool, just STOP ASSIGNING<br/>
things to her. :)<br/>

Hi I am  new to the list- mom to Emily (13) Jasmine (4) and |Theo (4 <br/>
months) living  in a little UK village.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Hi, Amanda. Welcome to the list. I know there is a HUGE group in the UK  that <br/>
unschools----they even have a big camping weekend once a year. Maybe if you  <br/>
could get together with them, she could chat with other teens and maybe other  <br/>
moms and see that it DOES work. If you can&#39;t find a group---let us know.  We <br/>
put out a call to the other Brits and ask them for more info about  this <br/>
gathering.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>

 <br/>
The other &quot;formal&quot; homeschooling you&#39;ve been trying these past five years  <br/>
did this damage! She believes that she can only learn if someone is teaching  <br/>
her. And she believes that learning *must* look  academic.<br/>
<br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s HER job to challenge and stretch herself. And she WILL do it  <br/>
eventually. We&#39;re hard-wired to do just that. But not while everyone else is  doing it <br/>
for her.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m artistic. But when I was in school, I was academically-based. I was  <br/>
going to vet school, so *I* felt I needed lots of math and science and Latin and  <br/>
Greek. *I* pushed myself in that direction. And HARD! Had I been unschooled, I <br/>
 STILL would have been driven to study these things. I was driven. I still <br/>
am!  &lt;g&gt; But in different things at different times. <br/>
 <br/>
I would have loved _The Well-trained Mind_ as a kid! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

to  do..&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I think you need to find some adults/older teens who have done *what*  they <br/>
want to do----and who are happy doing just that.<br/>
 <br/>
She at an age that&#39;s difficult because she can&#39;t see that far into the  <br/>
future AND she&#39;s believing what her peers and society tells her. My son was  really <br/>
unsure about this new unschooling journey at that age too. But now his  <br/>
schooled friends are absolutely miserable in high school, while he pursues what  <br/>
he&#39;s interested in. He&#39;s the happiest teen he knows! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
You really need to make some contact with other unschoolers IRL. That helps  <br/>
IMMENSELY with teens. At last year&#39;s conference, we saw a couple of teens that <br/>
 thought their moms were *nuts* for even contemplating unschooling. They <br/>
changed  over the weekend when they met 20 or so teens that were so incredibly <br/>
happy with  their lives. They discussed what they do during the days (and nights! <br/>
&lt;g&gt;)  and they found common interests. Several are getting together next <br/>
month to hang  out!<br/>
 <br/>
Anyone else have info about this camp-out in the UK? Or an unschooling  <br/>
contact there? I get the Freedom in Education newsletter from the UK every  <br/>
month----but is there a contact person? Conferences? <br/>
 <br/>
Unschooling is about learning whatever strikes your fancy. If she *wants*  to <br/>
learn more academically-based stuff, well, that&#39;s her own unschooling. But it <br/>
 would be at her pace and what interests HER. <br/>
 <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t touch Elizabethan history with a ten foot pole! But I&#39;m a nut  for <br/>
Egyptian, Roman, Greek, Celtic, Revolutionary, Civil War, Tsarist  Russia, & <br/>
WWI history! She may have a special time in history that  fascinates her. And <br/>
science----I love most of biology----but ONE-CELLED JUNK? No  way! I think <br/>
physics is pretty cool---but chemistry???<br/>
 <br/>
She can make her unschooling as schooly as she&#39;d like. Mine would have  been! <br/>
But she needs to understand that it can look like whatever she&#39;s  interested <br/>
in.<br/>
 <br/>
If she complains that she wants to learn these things, but doesn&#39;t want to  <br/>
do the work----well, then she DOESN&#39;T want to learn it. Not really. We&#39;re each  <br/>
capable of learning pretty damned complex things when we want to. It&#39;s truly  <br/>
amazing. She just needs to think about this a bit.<br/>
 <br/>
Has she read _The Teenage Liberation Handbook_? Or have you read it to  her?? <br/>
How about Frank Smith&#39;s _The Book of Learning and Forgetting_? Two really  <br/>
great books for teens to really understand that THEY are in charge of what goes  <br/>
into their heads!<br/>
 <br/>
Good luck----and I hope to see you back here! I&#39;ll work on some contact  info <br/>
in the UK!<br/>
