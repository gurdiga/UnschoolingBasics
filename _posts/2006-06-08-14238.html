<div id="ygrps-yiv-2020702336">I have a friend that is trying to get started on her own as a new<br/>
single parent, and is looking for other single unschooling Mums to<br/>
create a co-housing opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the info:<br/>
<br/>
A few moms are gathering to share housing and childcare in the Johnson <br/>
City/Jonesborough TN area.  Have your own bedroom, with access to all<br/>
the common  living/ eating/ laundry areas in one large house and share<br/>
rent, expenses and  childcare that supports unschooling philosophies.<br/>
 Are there are other single moms who need a place?  Please email<br/>
offlist at and I&#39;ll forward it to the person that is organizing this.<br/>

Thanks everyone,<br/>
