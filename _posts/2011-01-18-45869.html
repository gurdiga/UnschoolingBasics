<div id="ygrps-yiv-618782329">My cat has a caboodle. He puts his toys into his cozy bed and sleeps on top <br/>
of them.   We call it the kitty kaboodle and refer to the cozy bed as the <br/>
kk.    Sometimes I find my shawl in the kk.<br/>

I thought Meredith had been peeking though our windows when I read that. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
And then I thought she probably typed &quot;kitand&quot; and her spell check &quot;fixed&quot; <br/>
it for her.<br/>
