 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s confusing, for sure! It&#39;s *possible* to make unschooling work in every state in the US as well as in some other countries - but &quot;possible&quot; isn&#39;t a guarantee. It takes resources. I don&#39;t mean money, necessarily; if anything the support of people around you can make or break your ability to feel confident enough to unschool. And one essential resource for unschoolers is the ability to navigate local legal challenges because *homeschooling* isn&#39;t always technically legal in and of itself (you have to join an umbrella school, or register as a private school, for instance) and even in places where it is, unschooling often needs to be buried in the loopholes in order to be legitimate. <br/>
<br/>
Local groups are a Great resource for understanding the ins and outs of your local laws and loopholes. Don&#39;t stick to just unschooling groups if you need help in this area - look for any homeschool group you can find. This group (U.Basics) isn&#39;t such a great resource in that regards because its an international list, with members struggling to unschool in places where even homeschooling isn&#39;t necessarily legal. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I didn&#39;t think it through as far as even though it<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Have you had a conversation with your evaluator, yet? It seems like you are painting things very black from fear. One of the resources vital to unschooling is confidence in yourself and your children. It&#39;s hard to maintain that confidence when people around you aren&#39;t being supportive, but at the same time the way you communicate with those people can make a big difference. If you are hostile and defensive, they&#39;ll worry that you really do have something to hide. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We really have no<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is where local support will be more helpful to you than an international list like this. We can give you pep-talks and say &quot;I bet there are other options!&quot; and the like, but you need real nuts-and-bolts information as well. Go looking. Stand up for your kids. Find or create options that work better for you. Sometimes unschoolers Do end up compromising in order to live in the world but it doesn&#39;t need to be a disaster. You can see the situation as an opportunity to learn new things, make new connections, touch base with what&#39;s important to you in deep, profound ways. <br/>
<br/>
What I love most about *radical* unschooling is that limits don&#39;t have to be end points, they can be chances to re-orient and discover something new. <br/>

<br/>
That isn&#39;t what you&#39;ve posted, though --  if you as a not-unschooler, seek unschooler support to help you make that point to others not unschooling, all so you can continue not-unschooling as you see fit (in the process confusing all those reading who do want to unschool successfully and are working out how to make it work in their families) then the point that needs making here, is how sitting children down to force them to do lessons, at any age, leads away from unschooling. Not toward it. <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine you&#39;ve read unschooling books that advise otherwise.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think what you&#39;re missing is that this group has a focus on unschooling at its most fundamental. In that sense, it isn&#39;t true that &quot;some children learn later&quot; - children are learning all the time! They don&#39;t all learn the same things at the same time or rate, though, certainly. I think you might know that, but its worth keeping in mind Especially if you&#39;re feeling threatened. <br/>
<br/>
Because the focus of this list is the core of unschooling - how children learn and how we can support them - people will challenge statements that seem to assume that &quot;learning&quot; can be broken up into subjects like math and reading, or that reading requires a knowledge of phonics or that math is about arithmetic. You&#39;ve written some things which imply you&#39;re more interested in a gentler way to present those kinds of topics to your kids, and if that&#39;s true this list likely isn&#39;t a good fit for you. It&#39;s a place to move Away from &quot;learning opportunites&quot; and toward seeing living and learning and relationships as all part of a big, wonderful whole. <br/>
<br/>
You also implied that &quot;100% unschooling&quot; looks like doing nothing, which couldn&#39;t be more wrong - and I think that&#39;s what JJ is trying to get at. Maybe that wasn&#39;t what you meant, but it &quot;read&quot; that way and its really important to many longtime whole life unschoolers to correct that misperception Because it leads to some of the same kinds of problems you&#39;re running into. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Others are looking at my children<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It might be helpful to articulate what you want from this list. If you want stories of other families where kids&#39; obvious skills don&#39;t line up with conventional academics in order to boost your confidence so you can be a better partner, I know we have list members who can share those kinds of stories. <br/>
<br/>
You *seemed* to be asking for help with reporting what you do in a way that works with local regulations, though - or maybe complaining and looking for some sympathy. Neither of those are bad things, but they are beyond the scope of this list. It&#39;s not a social or legal issues list, its a &quot;help me get past the school in my head so I can be a better partner to my kids&quot; list. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;ve read plenty of<br/>
&gt; books about unschooling, I know what it is.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You might want to re-read the list description, though - its easy to see &quot;unschooling basics&quot; and click &quot;join&quot; with a bunch of misconceptions about what this list is for/about. It says:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If you&#39;re familiar with radical unschooling in theory, but unsure of how to begin or wondering how living without chores, bedtimes or imposed limits on electronics and food really looks like, this is a place for you to discuss, question, ponder and become deeply familiar with natural learning and how it affects our entire lives. From parenting issues to learning from the whole wide world and beyond, come explore the issues that unschooling families have dealt with in the past and how to get beyond &quot;school-think&quot; to a joyful unschooling lifestyle!<br/>
<br/>
Whole life/radical unschooling goes well beyond ideas of &quot;teachable moments&quot; and &quot;the world as your classroom&quot; to a view of learning as an inherent part of life itself. If you aren&#39;t familiar with radical unschooling, you&#39;ll find a wealth of basic information here:<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschooling">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a><br/>
<br/>
Newcomers to the philosophy of radical unschooling are encouraged to ask questions, but please take some time to read and get a &quot;feel&quot; for the list before posting. Whole life unschooling goes so far beyond academics that it involves a whole different approach to family relationships. Everything you think you know is about to be questioned. &quot;<br/>
