Anyways- someone posted and said that I should take over the <br/>
responsibility of<br/>
the rabbits entirely and let her help when she wants to. She will watch <br/>
me<br/>
taking care of them and learn that way. They also said how she showed <br/>
and<br/>
interest in something and how I am now punishing her with them. That <br/>
floored me<br/>
and got me to thinking. I know this sounds silly but I just never <br/>
thought of<br/>
taking care of them for her and allowing her to help if she wanted to. <br/>
So this<br/>
morning I asked her if she wanted me to take care of the rabbits <br/>
completely and<br/>
she said yes. She was worried that if I did it all that it meant that <br/>
we would<br/>
give the rabbits away. I felt so bad and started crying. I never ever <br/>
ever meant<br/>
for it to be that way. I just had the public school mentality of they <br/>
want it<br/>
then they do it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s a bigger gift than you can imagine---if you look at all <br/>
&quot;chores&quot; in the same way.<br/>
<br/>
By *your* saying, &quot;We *get* to care for our bunnies this afternoon! See <br/>
how grateful they are when they get new bedding? I&#39;m sure they&#39;re ging <br/>
to love these apples slices! I know they appreciate a clean water <br/>
bottle!&quot;---all said in a joyful voice as you go about caring for them <br/>
as something special---NOT a burden!---she&#39;ll see what caring for <br/>
others *can* be like!<br/>
<br/>
A child who is forced to begrudgingly care for a pet---even a beloved <br/>
pet--- that isn&#39;t a act of love. It&#39;s just a damned chore. The child <br/>
will often become disdainful of the animal---the animal, which has done <br/>
*nothing* to deserve that disdain other than to simply be alive. But a <br/>
child who has a generous MODEL of caring for a pet---someone who tends <br/>
lovingly and carefully for that pet&#39;s needs---will eventually care FOR <br/>
that pet with the same love and devotion.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the same with all the other chore talk that goes on here:<br/>
<br/>
A mother who grouches about each and every towel she has to pick up off <br/>
the floor or about all the crumbs left on the counter or about unmade <br/>
beds and messy rooms and garbage not taken out---or WORSE!: One that <br/>
makes the children do all these horrible, horrible household chores--- <br/>
she&#39;ll have children who have no desire to do such hated chores. <br/>
Children who avoid them and do them half-heartedly---and bitch about <br/>
them too! (modelmodelmodel!)<br/>
<br/>
BUT! The mother who does each and every one of these things with joy in <br/>
her heart and a smile on her face because she CAN---because she feels <br/>
her home is a special place for special people, will eventually have <br/>
children who feel the same way. Children who do these things out of <br/>
love, not obligation---who see these things as part of a joyful life, <br/>
not as a burden to finish quickly and without care. THESE children will <br/>
take pride and receive joy out of caring for others.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a paradigm shift! And it&#39;s sometimes hard. But if *we* choose to <br/>
be grateful for what we have and care for those things with love and <br/>
generosity, so will our children.<br/>

I&#39;ve a story about Hayden needing a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, really<br/>
late, as I was going to bed, already half asleep, on a regular basis. There<br/>
was an evolution that occurred as time went on. His first sandwiches<br/>
couldn&#39;t have tasted very good, I certainly didn&#39;t put any good feelings<br/>
into making them. I was grumbly and pissy and, quite frankly, a martyr. I<br/>
stomped up the stairs for the 158th time, and three up I realized this<br/>
situation sucks for both of us. Who the heck is this woman, throwing<br/>
*another* fit about a ding-dang sandwich at 2 am. DUH! How about making one<br/>
at 11 and putting it in a baggie for the 2 am request? How about if I just<br/>
take a really deep breath. And another one. How else could this be? Who<br/>
*else* should be making this sandwich? No one, really NO ONE, wants to eat a<br/>
sandwich made by a martyr. I was *that* someone by the top of the stairs. I<br/>
lovingly collected the fixins and put all of the honor I felt, in the<br/>
ability to make my boy a sandwich in the middle of the night, into each<br/>
stroke of my knife. THAT was the best sandwich my son ever ate. *I* may be<br/>
the only one of us who knows, that sandwich was made with the biggest dose<br/>
of mommy love available. I delivered it to him with a smile on my face and a<br/>
bounce in my step and gave him a big hug. He was really surprised... as he<br/>
ate, I apologized and hoped to always remember that I have the best job in<br/>
the world and I&#39;m *happy* to do it.<br/>
<br/>
One just never knows how many chances you&#39;ll *really* have to be *that* mom<br/>
for your kid. :D<br/>

NO ONE knows this better than Diana Jenner.<br/>
<br/>
Those aren&#39;t just words. Diana knows that those chances to be the best <br/>
mom you can be can be limited.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you new to unschooling and this e-list, Diana&#39;s daughter, <br/>
Hannah, died last February of cancer. It was a huge blow to the <br/>
unschooling world, but her death is a solemn reminder NOT to be <br/>
solemn---but to find joy in each and every minute we *do* have with our <br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
Just as Diana shows in her peanut better sandwich story, it doesn&#39;t <br/>
take much to change how *we* perceive things, how *we* can change the <br/>
way we feel about a task---no matter how &quot;unreasonable.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I need to do it less and less, but the simple *thought* that this <br/>
precious child may be gone tomorrow has helped me through many angry, <br/>
frustrated moments. I still use it, but I&#39;ve found it easier to kind of <br/>
*stay* in that mindset so that I don&#39;t have to reach for it as much. <br/>
Usually simply a deep breath will help center and refocus me and remind <br/>
me to honor my baby. Not that I still don&#39;t lose it! &lt;G&gt; But it&#39;s <br/>
gotten easier and easier to banish those creepy thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
Not a day goes by that I don&#39;t think of Hannah (and Sam and Jacob). And <br/>
I know that their mothers would give anything to have *my* &quot;problems&quot; <br/>
at any minute.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1180720961">Diana, I was thinking of this story (the Pb&j story) as I was reading the<br/>
good advice unfold in this thread.  I am so glad you retold it.  I remember<br/>
hearing you tell it at the conference in Corvallis and there was an older<br/>
lady sitting in front of me - a grandma probably new to RU who was muttering<br/>
something like &quot;.at 2:00 in the morning?  He needs a sandwich?&quot;  Although<br/>
she sat in front of me I think I could hear her eyes rolling.  By the end of<br/>
your talk, though she had softened and was visibly more relaxed (if a bit<br/>
tearful).   I think these ideas take a bit of time to soak in and make<br/>
sense.  I have no doubt that these rabbits could be the turning point in<br/>
this family as mom takes on the responsibility of making sure they get taken<br/>
care of and the child is allowed to join in with all that love.  There is so<br/>
much to be learned here and so many possible points of connection that could<br/>
come out of it.  Or it could spiral into a point of stress and contention<br/>
and lead down a path of controlling behavior or the sadness of losing a pet<br/>
because dd can&#39;t keep her end of the bargain.  How could she know at her<br/>
age?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The old scenario of dutiful 7 yo jumping out of bed and running to the<br/>
rabbit hutch to take care of her beloved bunnies hasn&#39;t panned out.  How<br/>
about a new vision where mom goes out every afternoon (before making dinner<br/>
maybe) and invites dd along to love on the bunnies together.  Maybe they end<br/>
up walking hand in hand bonding, maybe a lot of the time dd says &quot;no thanks<br/>
mom.&quot; And continues what she was doing but the love and respect stay in<br/>
tact, the bunnies are never resented and as she matures dd will have an<br/>
excellent role model to build from.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This thread has been a good reminder for me as well.  We parents make these<br/>
choices all the time, every day.  Kelly&#39;s post is practically a step by step<br/>
recipe for peace.  I think I&#39;m gonna go read it again.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Truly,<br/>
