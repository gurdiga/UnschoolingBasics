<div id="ygrps-yiv-1670356683">Hey all,<br/>

printed off a list of the movies showing.  It will definitely work for<br/>
bored little ones!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-862507448">it is not illegal to lend movies. I was just trying to unwind (<br/>
unsuccessfully) 3 threads I saw; 1. the legal/ illegality issue; 2.<br/>
the morality right/ wrong issue and 3. the guilt/ shame / blame issue<br/>
of starving the poor working class stiffs who depend on sales to<br/>
prevent homeless depravity. 1.the legal issue seems to be a structure<br/>
of rules that we will be punished if we don&#39;t obey; the inference is<br/>
that they are commonly agreed ideas of ethical behavior,, I think not<br/>
, as many tax laws clearly  expose.The majority of the laws derive<br/>
from those who have plenty pedaling materialism as a codified virtue. <br/>
 2.the morality issue ; what should we be doing in regard to its<br/>
impact  on others; I thinking living in the western  cultures almost<br/>
seals our fate in a complicity of taking what we want with a<br/>
unbelievably blind eye to this actions impact on most of the worlds<br/>
population. 3. guilt of hurting the gaffers salary by not purchasing a<br/>
film seems on the same continuum of I&#39;ll buy cotton from the slave<br/>
owner because it feeds the slaves; corrupt immoral systems should not<br/>
be linked with virtuous choices. sorry to belabor the point, but I<br/>
feel I was even more convoluted than usual. enough said. patrick <br/>
ps. joyce, nothing personal , I&#39;ve been a long time fan and first time<br/>
caller.</div>

<br/>
If someone breaks a law and they get caught there will be  <br/>
repercussions whether they agree with the law or not.<br/>
<br/>
Whether someone complies with a law is their own personal choice. How  <br/>
they justify not complying with a law is up to them. But neither  <br/>
changes illegal to legal.<br/>
<br/>
It was illegal for the members of the Boston Tea Party to board that  <br/>
private ship without permission and toss the cargo into the harbor.  <br/>
They decided to do it anyway. Most would agree with their  <br/>
justification in breaking that law. But justifying it doesn&#39;t erase  <br/>
the illegality of it. And the leaders darn well better have made sure  <br/>
the participants understood they were doing something illegal.<br/>
<br/>
Some homeschooling parents choose not to comply with their state  <br/>
laws. Being fully informed of the laws and repercussions and who they  <br/>
might affect beyond themselves (such as their children, other  <br/>
homeschoolers) should be part of their decision. But they would be  <br/>
irresponsible to their children to not comply without realizing  <br/>
they&#39;re in a state where noncompliance could bring CPS into the picture.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  2.the morality issue ; what should we be doing in regard to its<br/>

<br/>

to their own personal moral code.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to the people involved in creating movies and  <br/>
TV shows for these sites to be passed on without the understanding  <br/>
that it&#39;s not &quot;free movies&quot;. They are stolen intellectual property  <br/>
that the creators expected to be paid for. If people decide to watch  <br/>
anyway, that&#39;s up to them.<br/>
<br/>
That information is getting lost in the fact that the practice is so  <br/>
pervasive and easy. It feels as though it must be legal.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 3. guilt of hurting the gaffers salary by not purchasing a<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And it would be irresponsible of someone who organized a boycott to  <br/>
slave-labor cotton to be ignorant of any negative impact they might  <br/>
have on the slaves. It would be more responsible if they also planned  <br/>
to help those affected by their actions.<br/>
<br/>
Again, it was information. (BTW, gaffers don&#39;t get a salary. They are  <br/>
paid by the job. Money made from a movie impacts their next job. (How  <br/>
much it impacts is less clear and getting into politics and  <br/>
judgment.) As far as I know gaffers don&#39;t get residuals. Writers,  <br/>
actors and directors at least do.)<br/>
<br/>
If information makes someone feel guilty, then that&#39;s a sign  <br/>
something&#39;s grating against their morals and principles and they  <br/>
should examine that idea. That&#39;s what guilt is good for. Guilt from  <br/>
information and clarity has spurred parents to stop spanking and stop  <br/>
sending their kids to school. (It&#39;s not useful to stop at guilt,  <br/>
though. It&#39;s a beginning point.)<br/>
<br/>
Lack of clarity about what our actions truly are doesn&#39;t help us make  <br/>
good decisions.<br/>
<br/>
Ignorance of who we might affect by our actions is irresponsible.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1230227610">Seems to me there is no pure &quot;information&quot; free of moral judgment in<br/>
this discussion or most others.<br/>
<br/>
If there&#39;s a larger principle of use to unschoolers to be discussed<br/>
here, we can find it and then apply it back to specifics.  For<br/>
example, This American Life broadcast a wonderfully nuanced collection<br/>
of real people stories on our personal choices about rules and how we<br/>
hurt ourselves and others, yesterday morning on PRI.  It is titled<br/>
&quot;Ruining It for the Rest of Us&quot; -- one applies this principle to an<br/>
issue unschoolers know well, the anti-vax dilemma for individuals and<br/>
society.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://podcast.thisamericanlife.org/podcast/370.mp3">http://podcast.thisamericanlife.org/podcast/370.mp3</a><br/>
<br/>
Then the last story of the hour relates to the legalistic,<br/>
rule-following mindset of the &quot;Quiet Car&quot; concept on northeast Amtrak<br/>
trains.  The whole program is worth listening to just for this<br/>
progression of one woman&#39;s thoughts as she rides in the car week after<br/>
week and sees the self-righteous passengers (especially herself) as a<br/>
microcosm of society legalistically trying to make each other follow<br/>
the morally superior rules they&#39;ve all agreed to!  :)<br/>
<br/>
Another story is about research on three behavior types that &quot;ruin it<br/>
for the rest of us&quot; whatever the focus, in school or at work, in<br/>
social groups and in society at large -- the attacker-insulter, the<br/>
off-task slacker and the depressive-pessimist.  Basically the worst<br/>
team member affects the way everyone in the group winds up treating<br/>
each other. It&#39;s contagious. I think this insight is most useful when<br/>
we turn it on ourselves (am I the bad apple?) rather than judging and<br/>
attacking others for it -- which just makes things worse for everyone<br/>
-- and it applies to unschooling issues and unschooling discussions as<br/>
much as any.  <br/>
<br/>
The researcher&#39;s next project is testing the hypothesis that one group<br/>
leader can change that dynamic simply by asking questions and<br/>
listening for real understanding to the answers, almost like talk<br/>
therapy, so others experience that too, instead of just feeling<br/>
ill-used by the bad apple -- the idea is that this can defuse bad<br/>
behaviors, sort of inoculate the group against catching the poison<br/>
effects.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I would suggest that beyond &quot;information&quot; on laws and models<br/>
so desperately behind the curve that we all know it isn&#39;t working and<br/>
can&#39;t be sustained without reform (like schooling!)  we can look<br/>
forward instead, imagine new solutions that can be legal and moral and<br/>
practical, models that will actually WORK after the revolution! So for<br/>
something specific to lawful and moral profiting from entertainment<br/>
copyright versus big business ripping us all off with exploitative<br/>
protectionism, we could discuss for example this PRI interview about a<br/>
revolutionary model for music distribution, TuneCore:<br/>
<br/>
www.wpr.org/book/080127b.html   (second segment)<br/>

I just Googled &quot;ovguide illegal&quot; and checked through the blurbs of  <br/>

Obviously you&#39;re more likely to find lots of misinformation. But it&#39;s  <br/>
pretty obvious when someone is speaking from research than just  <br/>
passing on their opinion. One of the answers on Yahoo is something  <br/>
like &quot;Trust me. It&#39;s legal.&quot; Yeah. The fact that you can type an  <br/>
answer into Yahoo is a great foundation for trust ;-)<br/>
<br/>
But just as a rule of thumb, if a site is sending you offsite to  <br/>
YouTube or some other hosting site, or if the episode is split into  <br/>
pieces that you have to download, or if it doesn&#39;t have ads, it&#39;s  <br/>
probably pirated stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the owners of shows and videos are putting their stuff up on  <br/>
YouTube which is why you&#39;ll sometimes see ads. Those are official  <br/>
uploads to combat the pirated stuff. They&#39;ve recognized that people  <br/>
want to be able to watch it on demand. Which is good! :-)<br/>
