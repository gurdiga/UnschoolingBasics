<div id="ygrps-yiv-527736503">&quot;His eyes were wild and gleaming with<br/>
excitement.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t that a lovely thing to see?:)  Joy is contagious!<br/>
<br/>
I think you have a great attitude about his interest too....letting <br/>
him take from it whatever he wishes, rather than expecting a certain <br/>
outcome.  Have fun with the guitar search.<br/>
