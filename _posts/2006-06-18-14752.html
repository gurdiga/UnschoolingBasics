<div id="ygrps-yiv-1138156988">Hi All...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve really enjoyed checking out the blogs that you all share with the <br/>
group. It seems like the perfect way to keep the family up to date and <br/>
to keep track of things for reporting purposes in NY. I&#39;ve kept <br/>
journals in the past but later couldn&#39;t read what I wrote; my <br/>
handwriting is atrocious!!!<br/>
<br/>
There seems to be a million blog sites but I need one that is easy (I&#39;m <br/>
not computer savvy!), free and can be kept private/password/imvitation <br/>
only accessible. DH is in law enforcement so while he supports my <br/>
desire to blog he is concerned about too much info being too easily <br/>
accessible.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for all your help!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-144038766">Blogger is very easy. (It&#39;s part of Google.) My daughter figured it  <br/>
out without any trouble.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t have password protection but they tell  you how to keep it  <br/>
from being listed and give you a line to add to keep search engines  <br/>
from finding it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-353279958">I use blogger.com and find it pretty easy to use. I don&#39;t know if there is password protection or not, but you can limit the amount and kind of info you reveal.<br/>
