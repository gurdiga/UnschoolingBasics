<div id="ygrps-yiv-1365692276">I&#39;m not sure if this is legal, but she ought to consider it good advertisement since I&#39;m including the source:   Fresh from the Vegetarian Slow Cooker by Robin Robertson.<br/>
<br/>
5c oats<br/>
1c sliced almonds<br/>
3/4c craisins<br/>
1/2c raisins<br/>
1/2c sesame seeds<br/>
2/3c maple syrup<br/>
1/4c canola<br/>
1/4t cinnamon<br/>
<br/>
Mix all ingredients in crockpot.  Do *not* cover with lid.  Cook for 1.5 hours on high, then turn to low and cook an additional 2 hours.  Stir occasionally.  Spread on cookie sheets to cool and dry to crispy.  Yields about 8c.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously you can experiment with the ingredients.  I really like the craisins though.  I haven&#39;t tried reducing the syrup or canola because I&#39;m not sure how much the liquid is necessary for the cooking process.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy,<br/>
