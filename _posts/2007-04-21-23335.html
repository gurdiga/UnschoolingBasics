<div id="ygrps-yiv-438279958">I can&#39;t find the paper put out by Ted Kennedy&#39;s office, there are references <br/>
to it all over the place, but I found this:<br/>

<br/>
And I found this statement on literacy:<br/>
<br/>
The Literacy Record<br/>
<br/>
The pre-1870 record of educational outputs such as literacy was even more <br/>
impressive than the numbers of children in school, and this presents an even <br/>
more serious problem to typical authors of social histories. Professor Mark <br/>
Blaug has observed that &quot;Conventional histories of education neatly dispose <br/>
of the problem by simply ignoring the literacy evidence.&quot;5<br/>
<br/>
R. K. Webb, a specialist historian of literacy, offers the following <br/>
conclusions about conditions in Britain in the late 1830s:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  In so far as one dare generalize about a national average in an <br/>
extraordinarily varied situation, the figure would seem to run between <br/>
two-thirds and three-quarters of the working classes as literate, a group <br/>
which included most of the respectable poor who were the great political <br/>
potential in English life.6<br/>
<br/>
There was, moreover, an appreciable rate of growth in literacy. This is <br/>
reflected in the fact thatyoung persons were more and more accomplished than <br/>
their elders. Thus an examination of educational attainments of males in the <br/>
Navy and Marines in 1865 showed that 99 percent of the boys could read <br/>
compared with their seniors: seamen (89 percent), marines (80 percent), and <br/>
petty officers (94 percent).7<br/>
<br/>
It is not surprising that with such evidence of literacy growth of young <br/>
people, the levels had become even more substantial by 1870. On my <br/>
calculations for 1880, when national compulsion was enacted, over 95 percent <br/>
of fifteen-year-olds were literate.8 This should be compared to the fact <br/>
that over a century later 40 percent of 21-year- olds in the United Kingdom <br/>
admit to difficulties with writing and spelling.9<br/>
<br/>
which I got from here: <br/>

I don&#39;t know if something there helps, but maybe?<br/>

  ****<br/>
  Yeah, I thought of Gatto early on, but in researching some of his more recent writings, I found he&#39;s now advocating the complete abolition of compulsory/public schooling in America.  I don&#39;t necessarily disagree with him in principle, but in practice, many kids in the US are way better off in school than if they had no place but home with their parents -- or a nanny -- to spend their days.  That, and his position would completely turn off my inlaws, stripping him of all credibility, should they do any independent research on him.<br/>
