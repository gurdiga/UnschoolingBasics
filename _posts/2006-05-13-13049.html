 </span></blockquote>I found this on the NC official page for &quot;non-public&quot; education pertaining<br/>
to homeschooling:<br/>
The home school law (unlike public school law) does *not* allow for<br/>
exemptions from the annual testing requirement.  However, the law does<br/>
permit, for example, the administering of a 2nd grade level test to a 13<br/>
year old who is functioning academically at the 2nd grade level.  Note that<br/>
the science and social studies sections of the test are *recommended* but<br/>
are *not required* *by statute*.  In addition, North Carolina home school<br/>
law does not mandate that the student achieve a certain minimum score on the<br/>
nationally standardized test in order for the parent/guardian to be legally<br/>
permitted to continue to home school that student during the following (or<br/>
any future) school year.  Non-reader test editions are permitted and are<br/>
available.<br/>
<br/>
Which makes me ask, &quot;WTF?????&quot;  OK, special needs children in public school<br/>
don&#39;t have to take annual tests.  A homeschooled child can be tested at any<br/>
level (apparently), tests scores do not limit a parent&#39;s right to teach (so<br/>
a child could &quot;flunk&quot; the test and still continue to homeschool) and the<br/>
test scores are only required to be turned if asked.  So what&#39;s the<br/>
point?  This is, oh please let me say the word, stupid!  (Yeah, I&#39;m a tad<br/>
stuck on stupid tonight :-D )<br/>

it is.  The less attractive it is, the fewer people will homeschool.  The<br/>
fewer people who homeschool, the more students in the system and the more<br/>
tax dollars they have.  They more students in the syste, the more adults in<br/>
the system.  It&#39;s a control issue.  :-D<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-744388007">That is so true!  Well, this family won&#39;t be in the system ;-) I was<br/>
wondering how families who unschool go about the testing there, because a<br/>
reivew, etc isn&#39;t an option.. but I think we have found a way around that!<br/>
I am supirsed though that is  your only option there. Oh well, that&#39;s life I<br/>
guess ;-)<br/>
