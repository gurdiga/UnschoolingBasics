<div id="ygrps-yiv-1508322682">Hi all.  I am hoping that someone might have a recommendation for <br/>
me.  My dd would really like a butterfly net and a cool creature <br/>
keeper/something to keep bugs in for a while to watch them.  You all <br/>
might remember that I&#39;m in Turkey, and the store we have here on <br/>
base doesn&#39;t have much of anything!  I did a little searching <br/>
online, but I didn&#39;t find anything good.  There are just too many <br/>
homeschool supply sites to wade through, and I thought someone may <br/>
have a quick recommendation of a source that they&#39;ve used before.<br/>
<br/>
Also, we would like to find some kind of yard activities, like those <br/>
balls with paddles or little hand net/ball games - something of that <br/>
sort.  We&#39;ve been kind of bored lately and need some new <br/>
entertainment!  <br/>
<br/>
I would totally appreciate any help on this!  Thanks!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1369710355">What about trying Wal-Mart or Target Online?  You can shop via email <br/>
with the major stores like that now.  It may be cheaper than the <br/>
homeschooling supply stores.<br/>
<br/>
Also, here are a few fun links that may be helpful...<br/>
