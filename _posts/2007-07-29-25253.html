<div id="ygrps-yiv-583048509">My point about tv is that it&#39;s ALL advertising -even the programmes. <br/>
We are the product that is being bought whether we buy a something or <br/>
not. It is like buying billboard space in our homes. They are buying <br/>
access to us. It is only because advertisers. product placers, and <br/>
corporations pay for tv that it even exists. You don&#39;t have to buy <br/>
their stuff to be the product, all you have to do is watch. Again I <br/>
AM NOT ADVOCATING RESTRICTING ACCESS, just pointing out that kids <br/>
need to know that EVERYTHING on tv is actually advertising and <br/>
propaganda put out by corporations who are trying to manipulate us. <br/>
Kids know this about commercials, but they often don&#39;t know it about <br/>
the actual programmes they watch. In the same way that schools <br/>
pretend to educate, tv pretends to educate. I learned a lot in <br/>
school, despite the system. A lot can be learned from tv too, if you <br/>
realize that every programme, be it history, nature, news, drama etc. <br/>
is trying to manipulate the way you think to some corporate <br/>
advantage. When kids understand this, they can find out the real <br/>
truth, through real research.<br/>
I felt pretty betrayed when I discovered that all the nature shows I <br/>
watched when I was a kid were staged and the explanations given for <br/>
animal behavior were all grossly incorrect, and often politically <br/>
motivated.  20 years later nature shows are still staged and <br/>
inaccurate.  I am not saying that we should restrict our kids access <br/>
to tv. But we shouldn&#39;t be singing it&#39;s praises to them and claiming <br/>
that it is a way to access some great wealth of knowledge either. A <br/>
more neutral stance would serve them better. I fully support the <br/>
rights of kids to choose when and what to watch. But, the pro -tv <br/>
stuff I have been reading here lately is pretty over the top. It is <br/>
not some unschooling educational panacea, it is how corporations <br/>
access people.<br/>

<br/>
Like 2+2=4 we can point it out, but it helps learning hugely to  <br/>
*trust* that kids are intelligent enough to put the pieces together  <br/>
and will form an understanding.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re treating this like brain surgery. It isn&#39;t. It really doesn&#39;t  <br/>
take that much brain power to realize that a real brand name  <br/>
mentioned in a TV show is an ad and not a public endorsement of the  <br/>
superiority of that product.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter even pointed out during a Gilmore Girls episode that the  <br/>
expert car guy wouldn&#39;t be showing Lorelei Fords.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; put out by corporations who are trying to manipulate us.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And what&#39;s the return rate for all their dollars spent?<br/>
<br/>
People see all the money spent on advertising and think that much  <br/>
money must be powerful. But in truth the spend so much because it  <br/>
takes that much just to make any kind of impact.<br/>
<br/>
We had this discussion recently and someone said 2-3% are influenced  <br/>
to try something.<br/>
<br/>
And, really, look at what you&#39;re saying. *So what* if they&#39;re trying  <br/>
to manipulate us? You&#39;re treating it like it is working like a charm  <br/>
and we turn into creatures who blindly buy what we&#39;re told to buy.<br/>
<br/>
Is that true? I honestly don&#39;t know anyone like that. Advertising can  <br/>
*intrigue* me about a product but it can&#39;t convince me that it&#39;s  <br/>
superior once I&#39;ve tried it. The performance of the product does  <br/>
that. It can&#39;t make me turn my brain off and buy what I&#39;m told  <br/>
without regard to quality.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a good example. I probably wouldn&#39;t have tried Fructis shampoo  <br/>
without the ads and that awesome song. (Though the real, full version  <br/>
of the song is pretty nasty ;-) I have bought more because while it  <br/>
isn&#39;t better than anything else, it does work -- and it reminds me of  <br/>
the song when I see the bottle ;-) What&#39;s wrong with that? Where&#39;s  <br/>
the danger? If the product didn&#39;t work, I wouldn&#39;t buy it again. The  <br/>
advertising got me to *try* something I wouldn&#39;t have. The product  <br/>
itself (and the song) encourage me to keep buying it. I haven&#39;t been  <br/>
duped into believing something that&#39;s inferior is actually superior.  <br/>
I&#39;m not unaware of why I&#39;m buying it.<br/>
<br/>
Give people more credit than that! I&#39;m even a product of school and  <br/>
conventional parents who never gave me the advertising talk ;-). Even  <br/>
so I figured out advertising.<br/>
<br/>
If you step back objectively, and look at your own behavior, you are  <br/>
acting as you fear we are. You&#39;re reading the propaganda of the anti- <br/>
advertising people and believing it over what your own eyes see in  <br/>
your friends and neighbors. Do you see real people you actually know  <br/>
-- not the statistics in the propaganda -- who behave as you fear  <br/>
people will? I don&#39;t even see *kids* do that. Parents fear kids have  <br/>
been influenced because they ask for what they&#39;ve seen. But that&#39;s  <br/>
what adults do too. But kids aren&#39;t stupid. If something doesn&#39;t work  <br/>
as advertised, they don&#39;t keep buying the product. They don&#39;t keep on  <br/>
trusting that what they see on TV is truth.<br/>
<br/>
Please give kids more credit for intelligence than that. Unschooling  <br/>
can&#39;t flourish if you&#39;re so distrusting of children&#39;s intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
And by trust don&#39;t assume it means stepping back and assuming kids  <br/>
will figure out the world on their own! We need to be there for them.  <br/>
But truly all it takes is picking out the techniques advertisers use  <br/>
in a fun way for kids to catch on. It&#39;s a very simple concept.<br/>
<br/>
(What *does* though happen with TV is that parents start saying no to  <br/>
what kids ask for because they fear the kids have been influenced and  <br/>
want to nip that in the bud. But what&#39;s truly going on is that kids  <br/>
realize that if they&#39;re only going to get 1 out of every 10 things  <br/>
they ask for, then they need to ask a lot more to get what they want.  <br/>
That&#39;s the power of no. It makes advertising feel a lot more  <br/>
effective than it is! If we just buy what the kids are asking for and  <br/>
trust their intelligence (and be there with them for support as they  <br/>
explore) they will figure out advertising *much* quicker than kids of  <br/>
parents who say no.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But we shouldn&#39;t be singing it&#39;s praises to them and claiming<br/>
&gt; that it is a way to access some great wealth of knowledge either<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because you fear TV advertising so much, you are reading  <br/>
unconditional praise because we aren&#39;t including your fears with  <br/>
every mention of TV.<br/>
<br/>
We trust kids are intelligent. We are with our kids, not filling them  <br/>
with fears, but exploring how the world works.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t as difficult to understand as you are painting it to be. It  <br/>
takes a moment to point out an advertising technique and have fun  <br/>
exploring that with kids.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Try coming at this from a different direction... when kids aren&#39;t <br/>
expected to swallow adult bs hook-line-and-sinker on a daily basis, <br/>
they tend not to blindly accept things at face-value. They form <br/>
their own theories and test them in the real world. Why should my <br/>
kids believe *anything* they see or hear or read? They have the <br/>
opportunity to test the trustworthiness of *my* words, after all, <br/>
and the opportunity to disagree with me, to offer their own <br/>
attitudes and ideas and have me consider them seriously. They know <br/>
that their own words and thoughts are *as* valuble as adult words <br/>
and thoughts. That makes a big difference in the way they approach <br/>
*any* kind of information. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1404941537">****So any helpful advice?  Is my unschooling 6 year old sub-par because <br/>
 she hasn&#39;t figured this stuff out on her own compared to your <br/>
 unschooling 6 year olds? (just kidding, just so you know) What am I <br/>
 doing wrong? Or what aren&#39;t I doing wrong?****<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s all in how we react to it.  I used to think my daughter wanted everything she was excited about and I would get this defensive feeling, like..&quot;she wants to buy that too??&quot;  But one time she told me off,  saying, &quot;just because I&#39;m showing you this or talking about it doesn&#39;t mean I have to have it or buy it!&quot;  &lt;g&gt;  She just gets excited seeing new cool things.  I&#39;m the same way.<br/>
<br/>
So maybe you could just share her excitement and joy for things without all your thoughts about what the TV people are doing.  You say you aren&#39;t fearful of it all but what ever feelings you are having, I&#39;m sure they&#39;re still coming across to your daughter.  I know we can&#39;t and don&#39;t want to mask all of our emotions, but to see why she&#39;s interested in those certain things might bring you closer to where she&#39;s at.  It might bring you out of your position and thinking about TV and into sharing her joy.<br/>
<br/>
***Of course we gently discuss commercials and obvious <br/>
 advertising, usually by answering her questions rather than <br/>
 initiating it ourselves. That part is easy. But I do struggle with <br/>
 how to talk to her about how consumerism in a larger sense is being <br/>
 relentlessly promoted on tv. ****<br/>
<br/>
I think the easy part that you are referring to is what you should continue doing.  And then let her think about it.  She might not agree with you on your opinion.  Even if the TV industry is doing what you say, (I don&#39;t know many people in that industry) I think kids are pretty savvy and your daughter will figure it out too.  Just be available to her and answer her questions. (like you said )  Maybe it will even take a purchase or two to figure it out. ;)  And that&#39;s ok too,  my girls soo wanted &quot; The Original Chocolate Factory&quot;  The ads made this little sauce pan and accessories look so awesome.  So we got it.  They were so excited when they received it in the mail and we had some fun with it.  It probably wasn&#39;t as great as they thought it was going to be but we still had some fun.  They have made some other decisions based on that and other purchases.  It&#39;s all been OK.  I&#39;ve helped pay and they&#39;ve paid,  both options and they are getting more savvy about it all the<br/>
 time.  They are 10 and 12 now.<br/>
<br/>
For us, just looking at TV as another resource seems to go pretty well.  The selling and promoting is going to be everywhere.  There are different radio shows that I wouldn&#39;t want to listen to also that are trying to sell certain ideas.  There are books that are also trying do the same thing.  But we can choose not to read them or turn off the TV or radio.  We can then in turn go back and listen to or watch something that we feel is valuable.  That way it doesn&#39;t have to have this big power over us.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like a big smorgasbord of choices!   That&#39;s why I love this RU life.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1257780061">Maybe words from Scott Noelle can address these concerns.  He puts things so well.  I&#39;m sure a lot of people here get his e-mails but this one really addressed what I was trying to say as far as TV discomfort.  I think it can be applied to any of our own discomforts though.

THE DAILY GROOVE ~ by Scott Noelle<br/>
www.enjoyparenting.com/dailygroove<br/>
<br/>
:: The Canary In the Coal Mine ::<br/>
<br/>
Long ago, miners avoided death by bringing<br/>
 canaries<br/>
into the coal mines. The sensitive songbirds<br/>
 would<br/>
react to small amounts of toxic gases, thereby<br/>
alerting the miners to the invisible danger.<br/>
<br/>
In a way, our children provide a similar service.<br/>
We&#39;ve been so conditioned to tolerate stress that<br/>
 we<br/>
often fail to seek relief from it, but our<br/>
 sensitive<br/>
children have no such tolerance. They often feel<br/>
*our* stress before *we* do!<br/>
<br/>
So when your child seems particularly irritable<br/>
 and<br/>
reactive, it&#39;s a good idea to ask yourself<br/>
 whether<br/>
s/he might be reflecting *your* stress. Check in<br/>
with your body and emotions, and let yourself<br/>
 *feel*<br/>
what&#39;s there.<br/>
<br/>
Seek the fresh air of soothing, stress-free<br/>
thoughts, and then bless your child for keeping<br/>
 you<br/>
in touch with your Inner Guidance.<br/>

So maybe it&#39;s not the TV or the game or the &quot;what-ever&quot;<br/>
 that&#39;s causing the stress?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s our own stress over these things?<br/>
