Register and book your hotel room today. It really is so much fun to stay at the<br/>
hotel if you&#39;re able to. There&#39;s lots of really fun Funshops happening. My<br/>
daughter, Olivia is hosting a Ninjago Lego Funshop. There&#39;s also going to be a<br/>
full art room hosted by Spramani E&#39;Laun and Nature of Art Kids. Many great<br/>
speakers including Sandra Dodd, Blake Boles, Phil Biegler, Robin Coburn, Holly<br/>
Dodd, Ronnie Maier, and Tiffani Bearup. The chat circles are a great intimate<br/>
opportunity to ask questions about unschooling . And, you&#39;re sure to have lots<br/>
of fun at the many activities planned; beach potluck, pool party, surfing<br/>
lessons, artisan bazaar, & more!<br/>
<br/>
If you have any great ideas for a Funshop, something your kids are passionate<br/>
about or that you are passionate about be sure to sign up under the Funshop<br/>
page.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you there!!!<br/>
