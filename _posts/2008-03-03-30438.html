<div id="ygrps-yiv-1877261602">Yesterday I had to attend a funeral of a dear friend, so my hubby and <br/>
son decided to stay home (I was fine with this, son is 12.5 and did not <br/>
feel comfortable going).......so last night when I got home, hubby and <br/>
I always discuss our days, he said ok I get it.  I said get what, his <br/>
answer, your teaching style.  Ok I was confused because the other day <br/>
he told me that I maybe alittle to &quot;liberal&quot; in my teaching.  Well he <br/>
talked about how our son was just a bucket of questions (apparently <br/>
they were working on their model trains).  I said yep that is most <br/>
days, if you find something he likes he is all consumed with it, and <br/>
then on to the next idea.  We do tend to use some traditional books, <br/>
these are choosen by our son, I guess I mix liberal art and unschooling <br/>
together, but hey whatever work I say.<br/>
So anyways, I told my husband that it is very hard to sit him down with <br/>
a textbook, and this is why they get tossed in a box.  He gave me a <br/>
hug, told me to keep doing what I was doing, because we had a really <br/>
great child.<br/>
Made me feel good, they really enjoyed their day togeher.<br/>
