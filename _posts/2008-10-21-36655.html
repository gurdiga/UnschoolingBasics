<div id="ygrps-yiv-113537530">I just registered for the Winter Waterpark Gathering in Ohio in February. We&#39;re really excited about going!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to remind folks that the Early Bird deadline is October 31. You may certainly register and get a room *after* that, but the best deal can be had before November.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Halloween is fast approaching, and I didn&#39;t want people to miss the deadline because they&#39;re too busy adding last minute additions to costumes. &lt;G&gt;Â <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Registration is free (and so are the waterpark passes!), and the only upfront charge is one night&#39;s hotel fee. Sweet deal!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I hope to see a bunch of you at the Waterpark!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-310446714">We are so excited about the Water park gathering.  We registered as soon as<br/>
we heard about it.  I am really hoping to hook my daughter up with some<br/>
girls 9 or 10 years old prior so they can chat on the phone or email.  We<br/>
have one of those unlimited calling plans so that we can call my family in<br/>
CA.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1182620149">I just got your email Kelly and after reading it immediately signed<br/>
up.  My daughters birthday is on the second. I think this will be a<br/>
fun trip and a very long car ride from Greenville,SC!<br/>
