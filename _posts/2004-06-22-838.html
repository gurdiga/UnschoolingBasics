<div id="ygrps-yiv-889237132">Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
So I was driving in the van today with my dh and the guy who does some work for us and we were talking and homeschooling came up and he said he thought it was a good idea, but only served to isolate and segregate people into sub groups more and he thought that wasn&#39;t a good thing. I found this to be an interesting perspective and one I hadn&#39;t heard before and really had nothing to say in reply. He continued to comment that sure school might be hell but it prepares you for the hell of real life (ok his bias there) and I have heard this one before and don&#39;t agree... but what do you think about the thought that homeshooling is segregationist?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your thoughts,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I would respond that the schools, public and generally private, are the ones that segregate into the sub groups.  First, students are segregated by grade and all students in each grade are the same age with maybe one years difference.<br/>
<br/>
Then, you have the smart or gifted students, the average students (grouped according to ability), and the remedial or learning disabled students.  There are also the ADD/ADHD kids and many other labels when you get into special education.  Each of these groups has their own teacher.  Even the average kids are divided up based on ability level.  <br/>
<br/>
Once a student is in a specific track.  It is very difficult, sometimes nearly impossible, to get out of that track.  <br/>
<br/>
In high schools here students are tracked according to whether or not in elementary and junior high they performed well enough that they might be going to college.  The students are put into the track when they enter high school.  So you have college prep diplomas and a basic or general diploma, and it&#39;s not at all the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
When I went to school and it wasn&#39;t all that long ago, the start of high school was a clean slate and that was when it started counting, not anymore.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t even really see how school prepares you for real life.  It&#39;s a very different thing from working a real job unless you are a teacher!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1541724764">Well, I suppose it COULD be segregationist.  And in some families I&#39;m quite sure<br/>
they have that as a goal of their keeping their kids home.  But I think it<br/>
really depends on the family.  If it is important to us to see that our<br/>
children interact with various people it is not too hard to see that it<br/>
happens.  Since unschooling kids are in real life situations more than ps kids<br/>
I would say it doesn&#39;t have to be a problem at all.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been fortunate enough to take several trips.  To Mexico, to Singapore, and<br/>
we are currently living in China.  We definitely aren&#39;t too segregationist.  We<br/>
get to learn about a lot of different ways of thinking and living.  <br/>
<br/>
For some people it would be a bit harder based on where you live.  But still I<br/>
think there are lots of ways to &quot;strew&quot; things in our children&#39;s path that will<br/>
give them a broader perspective.<br/>

that homeshooling is segregationist?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are undoubtedly some families out there who are homeschooling in order<br/>
to facilitate isolating their children from other people for whatever<br/>
reason. I don&#39;t know whether they are the majority or not.<br/>
<br/>
I only know that for my family, that is not something we aspire to, although<br/>
it may be a temporary situation while Jayn is young and still discovering<br/>
her own passions. I mean that she is not taking classes at community<br/>
college, or seeking part-time work at this stage in her life. Her life and<br/>
activities do revolve around her family and nearest friends.<br/>
<br/>
The first thing that I did upon choosing to be a homeschooler when Jayn was<br/>
about a year old, was join some online lists. The next thing was to join a<br/>
newly formed (when Jayn was 18 months old) local inclusive support group. My<br/>
group has many people of different faiths, industry affiliations, family<br/>
sizes and homeschooling styles. Our *only* commonality is home schooling. <br/>
<br/>
People put themselves into networks, seeking like minded folk, or people<br/>
with like goals. Some of the networks I have been/are involved in are (in no<br/>
particular order): my local homeschoolers group; unschoolers; women<br/>
professionals in the film industry who are my friends (from before I had<br/>
Jayn); associates of my husband who are part of my new career as a<br/>
screenwriter; theater people locally, in Texas and back in Australia; the<br/>
people in my building who are my neighbors.<br/>
<br/>
I think actually being segregated from society means a lot of hard work to<br/>
accomplish. It might be easier if you kept your children in the house,<br/>
sitting around a table mimicking a classroom. That doesn&#39;t sound like<br/>
unschooling. Jayn pretty much comes with me whenever I go out for any reason<br/>
including the rare occasions when I work outside of my home office. <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I do actively seek out homeschooled kids for her to play<br/>
with most of the time, mostly because there is a greater culture of freedom,<br/>
no school propaganda or toxic behaviors for either of us to deal with, and I<br/>
don&#39;t have to listen to parental school bashing conversations (a sinkhole of<br/>
misery waiting to trap the unwary not unlike the delicious sin of gossip).<br/>
We have a couple of families that are schoolers that Jayn likes the kids. I<br/>
think the mothers don&#39;t tell me their school stories anymore, because I<br/>
always say, &quot;You have another choice.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I feel pity that this man feels that his real life is hell. I think he may<br/>
be sprouting platitudes instead of really thinking it through, by suggesting<br/>
that school and life have much in common actually. &quot;Surviving hell&quot; is not<br/>
something to pass on to our children as a life goal, IMO.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing conclusive, just some thoughts sparked.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you smile or say hi to an adult you don&#39;t know (at least in a small town)<br/>
they&#39;ll generally return the greeting. If you greet a (schooled) kid,<br/>
especially teens, they&#39;ll often not respond or respond awkwardly because to<br/>
schooled kids life is segregated by age and you don&#39;t socialize much beyond<br/>
your grade.<br/>
<br/>
Schooled kids are *more* segregated *more* isolated than people out in the<br/>
real world. Schooled kids have their own little societies limited by age,<br/>
with their own social rules (what&#39;s acceptable to wear, to listen to, to<br/>
watch, to like).<br/>
<br/>
As an adult and my daughter as a homeschooler we get to relate to people<br/>
based on shared interests.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; school might be hell but it prepares you for the hell of real life<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So that people can learn early that life sucks then you die?<br/>
<br/>
If someone has learned that lesson well, it&#39;s going to be hard to see that<br/>
there are other ways to view and live life!<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t it better to learn that life is what you make it? That if something<br/>
isn&#39;t right in your life that you have the power to change it?<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a hard lesson to learn in school where you&#39;re told to sit down, shut<br/>
up and do what the experts tell you is best.<br/>

In my unschooling approach, I gave in to my son&#39;s demands to go to<br/>
school for JK.<br/>
  <br/>
I had faith it wouldn&#39;t last, and it took him less than 2 1/4 hours<br/>
over 3 4-day weeks (I made him &quot;skip&quot;) to realize he didn&#39;t want to be<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
During this time, he learned to bite, kick, spit, watch the &quot;teacher&quot;<br/>
for when it he could get away with this behaviour, sexism (&quot;only boys<br/>
can use this ladder&quot;) and racism (&quot;we don&#39;t like _those_ kids&quot;)  [He<br/>
was also taught he &quot;doesn&#39;t colour properly&quot;, but that&#39;s another story!]<br/>
<br/>
My point is, school not only segregates, it teaches further segregation.<br/>
<br/>
So now, I segregate.  We do not actively seek out playdates with<br/>
schooled kids, and when it does happen (cousins, etc) I make sure I&#39;m<br/>
aware of what&#39;s said, as well as what they are doing.<br/>

<br/>
***<br/>
 <br/>
Well, speaking as someone who attended a public high school where 87% of the students were white, while the statewide figure is that whites are a minority, I had to laugh!  My public school days were very segregated, and that was in the 70&#39;s.  <br/>
 <br/>
Sure, in more recent years my son had a more diverse circle of friends and classmates in public school than I did, but that was more about us and our family style than about public school.  Of course, my perspective is different because my kids&#39; family is like the UN.  My dh is Asian-American, so our kids are hapa (half).  My Dad&#39;s second current wife is African-American. His last wife (who was close to my oldest son) is Isreali -- Dad converted to Judaism when he married her.  In our homeschool circles, there&#39;s quite a bit of diversity -- other multi-ethnic families like ours, hispanic, African-American, friends from two or three different pueblos, and neighbors who are diverse.   The same is true of our area LaLeche groupl  It&#39;s not just racial diversity, either -- we also have friends all over the religious spectrum, and of varying income levels.  <br/>
 <br/>
I do think segregation might be an issue in fundamental Christian homeschooling circles, but likely those parents would control their children&#39;s contacts anyway.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-54146366">My thoughts are that there is no better way to segregate children than<br/>
to put them in a classroom with 30 other children of the same age and<br/>
one or two adults all day.  Unschoolers, and many homeschoolers, are out<br/>
in the community with everyone else, and IMO school doesn&#39;t resemble<br/>
real life at all.  School segregates (people, time, learning),<br/>
unschooling integrates.<br/>
