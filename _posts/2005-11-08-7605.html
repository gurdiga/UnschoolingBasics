<div id="ygrps-yiv-929468653">&lt;I am also a recovering public school teacher (my years in<br/>
the system led to my decision to home school), which makes it<br/>
difficult for me to get away from the notion of &quot;basic skills,&quot;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh, but unschoolers do learn all the &quot;basics&quot; just not when, how, why <br/>
the public school system says they should.  When kids are invited into <br/>
your life on a daily basis and when they are provided with a rich, <br/>
passionate environment they do end up learning all those things that <br/>
the public school system deems &quot;basic&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I went through a phase where I feared my kids weren&#39;t &quot;learning&quot; <br/>
enough also but the more I let go and trusted the more I saw learning <br/>
happening ALL THE TIME!  I am now amazed at some of the things they <br/>
tell me that I have no idea where they learned it.  <br/>
<br/>
If you go to our website www.5freebirds.com, click on the about us tab <br/>
and scroll down you will see my son&#39;s interests/passions list.  It is <br/>
an incredible list of his interests and passions and I guarantee you <br/>
that little or none of those things could he have learned in school, <br/>
so my point is they are not &quot;basic&quot; things, but they are meaningful to <br/>
HIM and they serve HIS life in some way.  <br/>
<br/>
Keep reading here and you will see what interesting lives people live <br/>
and what wonderful relationships they have with their children.  <br/>
Slowly your fears and anxieties will disappear.<br/>
