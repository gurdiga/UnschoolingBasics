<div id="ygrps-yiv-1345271843">Hi all.I think I may have been on this list before,but anyway, I have <br/>
joined today. I have 4 kids, ages 3,7 9 and 11. (all pokemon fans)<br/>
<br/>
I have a question for you all. My 11 year old asked my why I don&#39;t <br/>
tell him he may not play his DS sometimes. He said maybe I should say <br/>
no if I think he&#39;s playing too much. I asked him if he thinks he is <br/>
playing too much, and he said,sometimes he does. I asked him why he <br/>
doesn&#39;t just stop playing then,and he said he didn&#39;t know. It seems <br/>
like he really wants me to tell him when he can and cannnot play. So <br/>
I tried telling him a time to stop...and then he argued with me,until <br/>
I reminded him it was his idea. I don&#39;t want to be the game <br/>
monitor,but my son is clearly asking me to set a limit for him. Would <br/>
it be better for him to monitor himself? <br/>
<br/>
To be clear, we have definitely been moving from  more structured <br/>
parent led/dictated  to  more self driven .In our homeschooling we <br/>
have gone back and forth between parent imposed structure/curriculum <br/>
and child led for a few years now. Is it common when faced with  new <br/>
personal freedom that a child will want outside/set limits?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1147256379">You&#39;re both in a black and white thinking mode.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of you monitoring or him self-monitoring - just take it as him  <br/>
asking you for support.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter wanted to start getting a little more sleep - but she  <br/>
really liked staying awake late and IMing with friends. She  told me,  <br/>
&quot;I really want to start being in bed by midnight, so will you remind  <br/>
me of that when it gets close?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You might say to him, with a smile, &quot;Are you having fun?&quot; Then he can  <br/>
decide if he wants to move on to something else or keep on with what  <br/>
he&#39;s doing.<br/>

<br/>
Is it common when faced with a new parenting style that a parent will <br/>
want outside/set limits? &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sure. &lt;g&gt; I just found it ironic that you were asking.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s HARD when we&#39;re used to one thing to make those changes. But with <br/>
time and patience we all come around.<br/>
<br/>
Help him, but don&#39;t expect the answer to be that he shuts the DS off. <br/>
Maybe ask whether he&#39;s tired or whether he&#39;s having fun. Just asking <br/>
should cue him into knowing you&#39;re offering the suggestion that he&#39;s <br/>
asking for. But don&#39;t have the expectation that he *will* turn it <br/>
off---just that he wants the reminder.<br/>
