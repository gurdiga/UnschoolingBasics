<div id="ygrps-yiv-556775757">Hmmm....not sure what you meant by this.   I think if you are going to yry to control what they watch (and I don&#39;t think you should), I think they are better off if you just say &quot;no,&quot; rather than trying to &quot;convey&quot; your &quot;preference.&quot;   They shouldn&#39;t have to read your mind, or guess, or be alert to subtle hints.  <br/>
<br/>
If you just mean that you think the movie is too scary for them, then I&#39;d give them that information.  Then they can choose not to watch it, or to watch it with you, or with the sound off, or one hand on the fast forward button on the remote......<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-328273068">Cat,<br/>
  I wasn&#39;t very clear in my post on  trying to find ways to convey my<br/>
preference. There are some shows that are more mature than my younger ones<br/>
can handle. I know that because they may watch but then have nightmares or<br/>
take a long time to get to sleep.Some are too stimulating for my youngest or<br/>
scarrey. I want to give them the option to choose but sometimes I need to<br/>
say no or not this one how about another one? I think I may have confused<br/>
the idea of giving kids freedom means never saying no...like I did with<br/>
discipline meaning punishment. I am still learning. Some of this is new and<br/>
I still make mistakes. Pieces fit together and I understand and we move on<br/>
Until I really understand a concept it doesn&#39;t all make sense to me or fit<br/>
together. Once I do it&#39;s no problem.<br/>
  The idea of no chores, letting them choose bedtimes, when to eat etc. is<br/>
taking me time to see it practically or in better words how to put it into<br/>
our daily lives and I have confused it with no limits. <br/>
  If I have this mixed up please help me to see the picture clearer.<br/>
<br/>

I&#39;m still working on it. <br/>

Why do they *want* to watch something that is distressing to them? Is it<br/>
possibly a minor rebellion against your disapproval? <br/>
<br/>
Maybe we have just been really lucky. There has *never* been a situation<br/>
where Jayn (4.5) has said something was scary, and then insisted on watching<br/>
it anyway. She always asks for fast forward, no sound or hides her face or<br/>
goes away. She will come and go, slowly gaining her courage. This applies to<br/>
live shows and the cinema also. She has never (yet) had the kind of<br/>
nightmares that others mention.<br/>
<br/>
Gradually is the way she dealt with her initial fear of Spiderman over the<br/>
last 2 years. In the beginning she was even afraid of the image of Spidey on<br/>
clothing or toys. DH had a pair of boxer shorts that worried her. He ended<br/>
up not being able to wear them. We would avoid the racks in the stores, and<br/>
I would pick her up and carry her past posters or toys. She would ask for<br/>
the DVD, then ask for us to stop it at different places, or jump past the<br/>
bad guy. Now she enjoys playing the S2 X-box game (which is amazingly mobile<br/>
- you really feel like you are flying around New York - and the views!) and<br/>
has watched the DVD of S1 several times, but not all in one sitting. She has<br/>
asked for the next one, which we will buy when it come out.<br/>

<br/>
  I don&#39;t think they feel it is distressing while they are watching it but<br/>
once they turn it off and go upstairs to bed they have a hard time sleeping.<br/>
They will come down to us and say&quot; that part in the movie that did such and<br/>
such scared me.&quot; <br/>
  When they want to watch something similar or with the big boys I will<br/>
remind them and alot of times they will say &quot;oh, yeah I forgot.&quot; But<br/>
occassionally they will want to watch regardless. Then we have the same<br/>
reaction. Right or wrong I have been just saying no and let&#39;s find something<br/>
else. They do and go on.<br/>

So I<br/>
simply pick him up from his middle-of-the-street tantrum, and try  to<br/>
explain why the street is no place to play.   <br/>

Why is it no place to play?<br/>
 <br/>
You said yourself that there is very little traffic.  Walk out in the  street <br/>
with him.  Show him how to watch for cars and where to go when he  sees one <br/>
coming.  I wouldn&#39;t go so far as to allow him to go out there  unsupervised <br/>
until he was much older, but I also would make sure to take the  mystery out of <br/>
it.  <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s only a power struggle if you stand your ground.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1020020814">***my biggest problem is &quot;conveying&quot; no to my son, who is determined to<br/>
stroll down the street. ***<br/>
<br/>
Instead maybe you can say &quot;wait till the cars are gone!&quot; then walk and<br/>
play with him in the street.  <br/>
Little by little talk about how the drivers can&#39;t see very small people<br/>
sometimes and why it&#39;s good to only go into the street when you (a tall<br/>
person drivers *can* see) can be with him.   And then be watchful so that<br/>
he doesn&#39;t have the opportunity to be in the street without you until he<br/>
really understands. <br/>
<br/>
***It seems there must be some rules and enforcement of them,<br/>
at least as long as children are toddlers and still learning what is<br/>
right and wrong, what is safe and what is dangerous.***<br/>
<br/>
It *is* safe to walk in the street when there is no traffic in the same<br/>
way it&#39;s is safe to stand under a tall tree when there is no lightening. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Not many of us would prevent our toddlers from standing under tall trees<br/>
just because there will eventually be lightening and then it would be<br/>
unsafe to stand there. <br/>
<br/>
Lots and lots of adults and kids walk in and across streets every day. <br/>
If you say it is never safe to go in the street he will see you and other<br/>
people in the street who are not getting injured and he will come to not<br/>
trust what you say.   <br/>
<br/>
*** I said &quot;no&quot; and tried to look serious, like I meant business.  But I<br/>
just<br/>
ended up laughing and figured he wasn&#39;t hurting anything or anyone, so<br/>
why not make fork-music? ***<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t really care if he bangs the table then there&#39;s no reason to<br/>
tell him no.  It sounds like you felt you had to say no because banging<br/>
the table *seemed* like something you should say &quot;no&quot; to. <br/>
When someone hears you say &quot;no&quot; and there&#39;s no reason for it or you don&#39;t<br/>
mean it, it will eventually not mean anything at all to them.  They won&#39;t<br/>
even hear it.   <br/>
<br/>
Before you can convey no to anyone you should have a good reason for<br/>
saying it.  Not some vague, might-be-a-good-idea-to-say-no-now reason but<br/>
a good, well thought out reason.   Don&#39;t say no because your mom would<br/>
have.  It will take more thought on your part, but thoughtful parenting<br/>
is worth it. <br/>

Jen, I&#39;d consider contacting a nearby college to find a student looking for  <br/>
income on maybe Tuesdays and Thursdays while taking classes MWF. Early <br/>
childhood  development majors, maybe. She could learn a few things from YOU! &lt;G&gt; It  <br/>
might even qualify as an internship---for credit.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-14671769">Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I find this conversation very interesting because my biggest problem is<br/>
&quot;conveying&quot; no to my son, who is determined to stroll down the street.  I<br/>
can say &quot;no&quot; and &quot;let&#39;s do something else&quot;, and I always must pick him<br/>
up.  This results in him throwing himself down for a nice tantrum in the<br/>
middle of the street.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;redirect&quot; method was easier when my son was younger, but now that he<br/>
is nearly two-years old, he has definitely developed a single-mindedness.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, military housing has little traffic.  But I don&#39;t want to<br/>
take chances.  It seems there must be some rules and enforcement of them,<br/>
at least as long as children are toddlers and still learning what is<br/>
right and wrong, what is safe and what is dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
I would like my son to be able to do what he wants - providing it is safe<br/>
- but I think we are still in those early stages of him learning about<br/>
the world around him, and that he can&#39;t &quot;run wild&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
An example of something less nerve-wracking is the other night, when my<br/>
son decided that banging his fork forcefully against the dining room<br/>
table produced the most beautiful of music... To him at least!  lol  I<br/>
said &quot;no&quot; and tried to look serious, like I meant business.  But I just<br/>
ended up laughing and figured he wasn&#39;t hurting anything or anyone, so<br/>
why not make fork-music?  <br/>
<br/>
Personally, I try not to say &quot;no&quot; too much.  That worked out well,<br/>
because my son waited until very recently to even pick up the word &quot;no&quot;,<br/>
but I know other children who started using &quot;no&quot; months earlier!   So I<br/>
simply pick him up from his middle-of-the-street tantrum, and try to<br/>
explain why the street is no place to play.  <br/>
<br/>
But even before that, I try to prevent any situation which might make me<br/>
feel as though I must say &quot;no&quot;.  I try to intercept his determined strut,<br/>
tell him the street is not safe, and suggest the playground.  *sigh*  New<br/>
parenthood is as baffling as homeschooling lingo to me!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
BB,<br/>

might be helpful to them - not as scary with mom or dad right there to <br/>
cuddle up with.<br/>
<br/>
I have a hard time sleeping after movies that are scary, too. Lots of <br/>
grown-ups do. Sometimes I watch them anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d probably suggest to them that we watch it in the daytime, not right <br/>
before bed.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, coming down and telling you that the movie scared <br/>
them seems fine to me - not necessarily to be avoided. That&#39;s &quot;talking <br/>
time&quot; for you - nothing wrong with that.<br/>

I saw your email and wonder if you&#39;ve found anyone to help you yet? I&#39;m on the unschooling basics list because I&#39;m very interested in doing this with my 7 year old son, but for now he&#39;s in public school. I live in Acton.
