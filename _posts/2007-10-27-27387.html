I feel like he&#39;s been unschooling since birth and I just didn&#39;t know<br/>

<br/>
What kind of activities did you find to be really stimulating?  <br/>
<br/>
Do you think that TV is bad for a child of his age?  Ours is on a lot<br/>

old, but I&#39;ve heard that before two it can hurt their eyes and<br/>
development.  <br/>

What are some awesome alternatives that you&#39;ve found to saying, &quot;NO!&quot;<br/>
in a panicked voice when your little one is getting into something<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We went shopping alot ;-) She was gentle and liked handling and  <br/>
seeing things. There was also a hands on museum we went to often.  <br/>
Walks. Markers. Playground.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been 14 years but I do remember it being a frustrating time  <br/>
since there didn&#39;t seem to be anything in particular that felt, as  <br/>
you say, stimulating for her. I think it&#39;s the age.<br/>
<br/>
It is very common at that age for kids to latch onto a particular  <br/>
video or movie and watch it over and over and over, often multiple  <br/>
times a day. It&#39;s just part of their stage of development.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>People say lots of things without it being true and moms want to  <br/>
latch onto the fear to protect their kids.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve got a whole list full of families with bright happy children  <br/>
who watched TV -- sometimes  a lot of TV -- when they were younger. I  <br/>
don&#39;t recall an inordinate number of unschooled kids at conferences  <br/>
with glasses.<br/>

from crying about something that upset her. Grief is a natural and  <br/>

Distraction from something imminently dangerous is perfectly fine.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2091940679">Thanks for the pointers, Joyce.  It&#39;s nice to be assured that all the<br/>
TV isn&#39;t going to &quot;rot his brain.&quot;  <br/>

the same type of object-- baby food jar lids, crayons, rocks, etc.  We<br/>
don&#39;t get out much as we&#39;re in the middle of nowhere with no<br/>
transportation.  We go outside some and explore.  We chase each other<br/>
around the house some.  But we get really bored and cranky sometimes,<br/>
and it would help to hear some suggestions from the good folks here to<br/>
give me a fresh look.<br/>
<br/>
I guess more than unschooling, I should be focusing on the attachment<br/>
parenting side of things... but it just seems he&#39;s so in the middle<br/>
right now!  I know I can blend them together seamlessly.  That&#39;s what<br/>
I like about radical unschooling, is that it is such a beautiful,<br/>
seamless continuation of AP.<br/>

something that I consider dangerous (a knife, a knitting needle) and I<br/>
have to pull it from his grasp or stop him from grabbing it at all, he<br/>
does express grief.  Sometimes to distract him I wave something<br/>
around, do a funny dance, and he just looks at me like I&#39;ve insulted<br/>
him, and keeps crying.  Is it better to try to distract him away from<br/>
grief or to hold him tightly and let express it?  Would validating his<br/>
emotions work?  Do you think he would understand that at so young an age?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks and stuff :D<br/>

You are making the items way more enticing (and increasing risk) by  <br/>
pulling them away.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve helped 2 year olds light matches, cut with sharp knives, cook on  <br/>
the stove, swim in the swimming pool, and on and on. You make sure  <br/>
they can do it safely.<br/>
<br/>
Then you keep things out of reach that are dangerous for them to  <br/>
handle without you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1264893969">Well, my 23 month old has always been unschooled. It seems to me that the most <br/>
stimulating thing was ME. It doesn&#39;t matter what we do, but being with sister or me doing <br/>
ANYTHING was what she needed. <br/>
<br/>
As for activities, she just gets carried along on all the big kids stuff. We just honor what <br/>
she needs to do on those visits to the zoo, museums and libraries. Hiking, climbing, <br/>
minigolf. But she&#39;s always loved tagging along in her sling.<br/>
<br/>
As for TV, she&#39;s always had the TV on and seems just like the other kids. My six yo and <br/>
four yo, same thing. Eyes are genetic, and I have seen kids who never watch TV need <br/>
glasses, and those who watch all the time never need them. Our boys all have glasses now, <br/>
genetic from me...so I can skip the middle man and blame myself lol!<br/>
<br/>
As for danger, it&#39;s so relative ;-) Not helpful, but I&#39;ve done what you mentioned, minimized <br/>
dangerous things. Then reassessed what was dangerous. I&#39;ve helped her with things that <br/>
are truly dangerous, and provided alternatives with things that are just out of my comfort <br/>
level. I always tell my kids not that something is &#39;too dangerous&#39;, but that it&#39;s out of my <br/>
comfort level and ask what we could do about it. They usually want to wait for dad, who&#39;s <br/>
coping is much higher than mine. One example I can think of, is using knives. To me, <br/>
those kid knives are so much more dangerous, they have to saw at anything outside of a <br/>
banana, so I was much more comfortable teaching her to use a serrated knife with me.<br/>
<br/>
Part of it is her being number seven, without that I probably would have had more trouble <br/>
letting go. HTH some anyway,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Heather - instead of pulling from his grasp perhaps you can say to <br/>
him, &quot;here let me show you how to use this.&quot;  My girls were using <br/>
knives as soon as they were physically able to pick them up.  As <br/>
curious human beings their intention is to do what people around them <br/>
are doing.  Utilizing a knife is very much a part of my daily <br/>
existence and thus their intention to learn how to use the tool is <br/>
very much like learning to walk and talk.  So many people were aghast <br/>
at my *allowing* my under 2yo to use a knife.  But they never hurt <br/>
themself or anyone else because they wanted to learn to use it for <br/>
its intention - to cut something (not themself).  My younger dd was a <br/>
competent wood carver at age 4.  <br/>
<br/>
My older dd still remembers with disgust when the waiter at Charlie <br/>
Browns removed the steak knife from her set up when she was younger.  <br/>
How insulted she was that they should presume she couldn&#39;t use a <br/>
knife...i mean how was she supposed to eat her food - pick it up and <br/>
shove the whole thing in her mouth!  We taught that waiter something <br/>
about possibilities and respect that afternoon.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My youngest is 2 1/2.  Oh what a difference a year makes!  <br/>
<br/>
Just remember toddlers love to immitate mommy and daddy.  Think of the <br/>
things you use and do on a daily basis - reading, cleaning, cooking, <br/>
and yes, watching tv!  These are the things your little one probably <br/>
wants to do.  The items you use for your daily tasks can probably be <br/>
aquired in a smaller size - just be sure not to toy it down.  My <br/>
daughter gets frustrated when a toy doesn&#39;t work like the real thing, <br/>
so I always try to make sure she has the real deal in a smaller size.<br/>
<br/>
A small bucket of soapy water, a small scrub brush, and a dirty floor <br/>
give my girly great pleasure.  Cutting bananas, cucumbers, etc, are <br/>
favorite activities, also.  Glueing is also tons of fun.  Rather than <br/>
turning your son loose with a bottle of glue, squeeze a small amount <br/>
into the bottom of a shot glass and give him a small lip gloss brush to <br/>
paint the glue on the paper.  Don&#39;t forget play dough, paint, chalk, <br/>
etc.  The key for this age is real practical living activities and <br/>
sensory experiences along with lots and lots of language.<br/>
<br/>
Check out &quot;Montessori From Birth&quot; by Paula Polk Lillard.  This book is <br/>
packed full of lots of ideas for activities for little ones, and it <br/>
helps you set up your house in such a way that all these things are <br/>
available for your little one to choose as he sees fit.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have three kids.  The oldest and youngest watched tv from a very <br/>
young age.  The middle one was sheltered from tv as a toddler (because <br/>
I had the same info you have).  The youngest and oldest turned out to <br/>
be very precocious, while the middle one (the one with no tv) has a <br/>
developmental disabitily.  Based on this experience, I feel I can <br/>
safely say that tv does not have a significant negative impact on <br/>
development.  Dora the Explorer has actually helped my girly develop a <br/>
better understanding of counting and numbers.  <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ll recommend the yahoo group AlwaysUnschooled. It&#39;s for families <br/>
unschooling children under eight.<br/>
<br/>
Many parents say they unschool their littlun; and then when the child <br/>
hits &quot;school age,&quot; they toss him into school. So it&#39;s hard to accept <br/>
that those parents are actually unschooling (child isn&#39;t even of school <br/>
age). But there are many families who live an unschooling life---who <br/>
abide by unschooling principles even with young children. These are the <br/>
parents who would benefit from---and who are regular posters on---the <br/>
AlwaysUnschooled list.<br/>

He&#39;s been *learning* since birth (and probably before! &lt;g&gt;). But <br/>
*technically* he&#39;s not been unschooling. You may be living by <br/>
unschooling principles though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1151724423">Firstly, thanks to everyone who responded!  You guys have given me<br/>
good suggestions.  I think I have started to relax and trust my own<br/>
instincts a lot just since I wrote this post.  I&#39;ve also realized that<br/>
hey, I&#39;m doing a pretty good job!  My son is happy and I&#39;ve mellowed<br/>
out, and everything is going quite well.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, see this is where I hit the wall sometimes.  I&#39;m not sure what<br/>
unschooling a child under 2 *means*, if it&#39;s not what I was already<br/>
doing.  We color together, I let him scrub the floor with a wet rag<br/>
the other night (which he enjoyed to no end!), I give him balls of<br/>
yarn which he happily unravels like a kitten, his father and I are<br/>
very attentive and playful with him.  We don&#39;t get out much, but any<br/>
more than we do is relatively impossible.  Is it not unschooling<br/>
before you just start calling it that?  Or do you mean he&#39;s too young<br/>
to be technically called unschooled?  I feel like I&#39;m REALLY missing<br/>
something here.  <br/>
<br/>
I will join the AlwaysUnschooled list as well, thanks for the suggestion.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re quite right-- I should be more specific.  Sometimes he grabs<br/>
something that we have failed to pick up-- a knitting needle,<br/>
something made of glass which he is banging on the tile floor, or<br/>
something jagged and boo-boo causing-- or he&#39;ll try to grab the plugs<br/>
in the outlets.  We do make a HUGE effort to not leave those things<br/>
laying around, and to baby-proof the house, but there will be slip-ups<br/>
sometimes.  It seems harsh to just yell &quot;NO!&quot; at him. Pam said that I<br/>
was making the items seem more enticing by taking them from him, which<br/>
is very true.  I feel like yelling &quot;NO&quot; at him will also make them<br/>
more enticing, or sometimes he just bursts into tears and it&#39;s heart<br/>
wrenching!  He&#39;s also been doing rather annoying things like banging<br/>
his juice cup into my monitor or the TV or my guitar (cringe!!!), and<br/>
it&#39;s quite funny to him when we try to stop him.  This is where<br/>
distraction comes in, I&#39;m guessing.  <br/>
<br/>
Another thing-- my husband and I differ on a couple of issues. <br/>
BooBear will climb up on the table and I&#39;m fine with that if it&#39;s<br/>
cleared of things that could hurt him.  But DH thinks that by letting<br/>
him do this that I am &quot;encouraging him to climb on the table even when<br/>
there is stuff there that he doesn&#39;t need to get into.&quot;  I sort of see<br/>
that, I guess, since I was pretty controlling like that with my little<br/>
girl.  (DS is his first child, so he&#39;s a little nervous, I guess.) <br/>
I&#39;ve heard people on this list say that they had a hard time getting<br/>
their little one to stop running in the road, but then they just let<br/>
them do it when it was safe, and they got bored with it soon.  That&#39;s<br/>
how I think it works.  It makes him happy to be on the table.  I&#39;m<br/>
preventing him from falling.  I shouldn&#39;t tell him not to do it when<br/>
there is no harm.  Right?  I&#39;m trying to NO AVAIL to get my hubby to<br/>
read up on some of this mindful parenting/unschool stuff, but he keeps<br/>
saying Boo Bear is just a baby, we don&#39;t need to worry about that yet.  <br/>
<br/>
I think we DO need to worry about it now!  He&#39;s so impressionable now,<br/>
and I want to take the best path possible for him.  <br/>

wondering if it&#39;s ::called::  unschooling when they are so small, and<br/>
if so, how people are going about doing that, and how that contrasts<br/>
with what I&#39;m already doing.  Just for curiosity&#39;s sake.  <br/>

<br/>
Yeah, see this is where I hit the wall sometimes.  I&#39;m not sure what<br/>
unschooling a child under 2 *means*, if it&#39;s not what I was already<br/>
doing.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t mean much in terms of not being in school---he&#39;s just too <br/>
young. What you&#39;ve been doing is basically what any parent of an under <br/>
two would do---playing with him and engaging with him. But by allowing <br/>
him freedom (within reason! &lt;G&gt;) and trusting and respecting him, even <br/>
at this very young age, you are setting up a loving <br/>
unschooling-friendly household already!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 We color together, I let him scrub the floor with a wet rag<br/>
the other night (which he enjoyed to no end!), I give him balls of<br/>
yarn which he happily unravels like a kitten, his father and I are<br/>
very attentive and playful with him.  We don&#39;t get out much, but any<br/>
more than we do is relatively impossible.  Is it not unschooling<br/>
before you just start calling it that?  Or do you mean he&#39;s too young<br/>
to be technically called unschooled?  I feel like I&#39;m REALLY missing<br/>
something here.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Right---he&#39;s not even school age. So how can he be unschooled if he <br/>
couldn&#39;t be schooled? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s more just attachment parenting, really. But you can start setting <br/>
up the environment (AND your attitude) for unschooling and simply <br/>
e-a-s-e into unschooling as a way of life without all the school <br/>
baggage that would come along in a few years.<br/>
<br/>
Mnay parents say they&#39;re unschooling their toddlers. THen the toddlers <br/>
become preschoolers---still &quot;unschooling&quot;---but when the children <br/>
become school age, the parents send the kids to school. SO....were they <br/>
actually unschooling? or were they just playing with their toddlers and <br/>
realizing that they&#39;re learning all the time before they decide to send <br/>
them to school?<br/>
<br/>
If you understand the philosophy, I think it&#39;s OK to say that you&#39;re <br/>
unschooling. If you&#39;re just doing what any parent of a toddler would do <br/>
but then cave and send him to school as soon as he is school age <br/>
because you think he needs &quot;an education&quot;---that&#39;s really just being <br/>
the parent of a toddler! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-==<br/>
<br/>
I will join the AlwaysUnschooled list as well, thanks for the <br/>
suggestion.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yeah---Danielle and crew can help you see how to keep on doing what <br/>
you&#39;re doing as he grows.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Another thing-- my husband and I differ on a couple of issues.<br/>
BooBear will climb up on the table and I&#39;m fine with that if it&#39;s<br/>
cleared of things that could hurt him.  But DH thinks that by letting<br/>
him do this that I am &quot;encouraging him to climb on the table even when<br/>
there is stuff there that he doesn&#39;t need to get into.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think a lot of people think that, because toddlers don&#39;t speak, they <br/>
can&#39;t understand. Duncan *loved* to stand on tables---he liked being <br/>
&quot;big.&quot; But, as you said, it&#39;s not always practical. But I would try to <br/>
make the area suitable for him if I could. I&#39;d clear it and *say*, &quot;Now <br/>
you may come on up!&quot; If I couldn&#39;t (at Grandma&#39;s, decorated for <br/>
Christmas dinner, for example) I&#39;d tell him that it wasn&#39;t possible <br/>
here now, but then we&#39;d try to find somewhere more appropiate. Because <br/>
he knew I would help him stand and dance on tables when I could, he <br/>
didn&#39;t wang out when he couldn&#39;t. It wasn&#39;t long before he&#39;d *ask* with <br/>
a questioning look or maybe &quot;Table dance?&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If they know that we will help them reach their goals whenever we <br/>
*can*, they&#39;re more liekly to agree *not* to when we really, really <br/>
can&#39;t. They&#39;re pretty reasonable when they know we&#39;re working *with* <br/>
them! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard people on this list say that they had a hard time getting<br/>
their little one to stop running in the road, but then they just let<br/>
them do it when it was safe, and they got bored with it soon.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe on another list. I don&#39;t think *anyone* here has said that. What <br/>
has been said is that, when a parent says that playing in the street is <br/>
not safe,...well, that&#39;s a statement that&#39;s not necessarily true. If a <br/>
child can play in the street and not get hurt, was the parent *lying&quot;*? <br/>
Mistaken? Being a control freak? When a child can prove the parent <br/>
wrong *once*, why shouldn&#39;t that child question everything the parent <br/>
says?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Drugs kill&quot;---or at least &quot;drugs are dangerous.&quot; But then a friend of <br/>
the child&#39;s smokes weed and doesn&#39;t die, who&#39;s doing the lying? When <br/>
the child smokes weed and isn&#39;t harmed (but had a good time), why <br/>
should the child trust the parent&#39;s judgment?<br/>
<br/>
Street&#39;s aren&#39;t necessariily dangerous. I used to play kickball on our <br/>
street. We would get out of the way when cars drove by. Kids *can* play <br/>
in streets. Sometimes they are safe. Sometimes they are not. Knowing <br/>
the difference is the important thing!<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes tables are a great place to play. Sometimes they are not. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
Knowing that our moms will help us play up there when it *is* safe is <br/>
the important thing!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=--<br/>
<br/>
   That&#39;s how I think it works.  It makes him happy to be on the table.  <br/>
I&#39;m<br/>
preventing him from falling.  I shouldn&#39;t tell him not to do it when<br/>
there is no harm.  Right?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Help him understand *when* it&#39;s appropriate and when it&#39;s not.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
 I&#39;m trying to NO AVAIL to get my hubby to<br/>
read up on some of this mindful parenting/unschool stuff, but he keeps<br/>
saying Boo Bear is just a baby, we don&#39;t need to worry about that yet.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Ask him when it will be the &quot;right&quot; time. What&#39;s the magic age? Four? <br/>
five? nine? fifteen?<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, he&#39;s *ALREADY* a parent. So a parent is what he already IS. <br/>
When does he think will be the right time to be a better parent?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think we DO need to worry about it now!  He&#39;s so impressionable now,<br/>
and I want to take the best path possible for him.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Parents only get one take---Childhood is NOT a dress rehearsal! THis is <br/>
the one chance you get to be the best parent to that child that you can <br/>
be. Why waste it?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I think that was the gist of my original post-- that I was<br/>
wondering if it&#39;s ::called::  unschooling when they are so small, and<br/>

<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
At this age, it&#39;s probably best called mindful parenting---and that can <br/>
continue right on up until your child is a grandparent himself. That <br/>
way your husband doesn&#39;t have to wait until your child is school-age. <br/>
He&#39;s a parent *now*, so it&#39;s a good time to start being a mindful, <br/>
better one. Worry about the &quot;unschooling&quot; later! It&#39;ll happen (to <br/>
borrow from Joyce) as a side-effect of mindful parenting! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks, Kelly.  I think I&#39;m understanding a little better.  You are<br/>
definitely right, I should try to get DH involved by using the term<br/>
mindful parenting instead of unschooling.  But I do think it&#39;s time to<br/>
worry about unschooling, because I also have a 4 year old dd from my<br/>
previous relationship, and he is having a seriously difficult time<br/>
with her.  He&#39;s always having power struggles with her, and it&#39;s<br/>
driving me mad.  If I ask her to do something (or not to do something)<br/>
and she says &quot;NO,&quot; I normally try to work it out, when appropriate.  A<br/>
lot of times I just let it go, if it&#39;s not causing anyone physical<br/>
harm.  I&#39;m trying to let go of my control freak impulses.  But he<br/>
talks over me while I&#39;m trying to problem-solve, saying, &quot;NO, you<br/>
listen to your mother, you don&#39;t argue with her, you just do what she<br/>
says, ALWAYS, or [insert random threat here.]&quot;  He thinks he&#39;s<br/>
helping, but he&#39;s really taking us back a few steps each time he does<br/>
this. (I have started to tell him, &quot;Look.  I&#39;m on it.&quot;)  It&#39;s hard to<br/>
figure out where to begin with him.  I try to email him links but he<br/>
never says whether or not he got them or checked them out.  When I<br/>
talk to him he&#39;s pretty unresponsive.  He has said a couple of things<br/>
that make me really think that we are just too different to do this<br/>
together.<br/>
<br/>
Example:  We were at his parent&#39;s house for dinner.  DD was sitting on<br/>
her legs, then standing on her knees in the chair, not really eating,<br/>
sort of singing randomly, and we were trying to get her to settle into<br/>
the chair and eat something.  She settles down but is still sitting on<br/>
one leg.  He starts to tell her that she needs to sit down ALL THE<br/>
WAY.  I said, &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter, she&#39;s eating now,&quot; and he said, &quot;I<br/>
know you&#39;re sitting there thinking that you have to pick your battles,<br/>
but what you don&#39;t understand is that you can pick them ALL, ALL the<br/>
time.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
So.  You know.  Dang.  What do you do with THAT?????  <br/>
<br/>
I hope I&#39;m not making him out to be a monster, because our<br/>
relationship isn&#39;t all that bad.  He fawns over his baby boy.  He&#39;s<br/>
also been unemployed for almost a year and is really stressed about<br/>
where the next rent payment will come from.  <br/>
<br/>
It is very helpful to think in terms of mindful parenting.  That will<br/>
hopefully help him deal better with DD.  I am so tired of the<br/>
authoritarian vibe in my house!  I will print some stuff out and put<br/>
it where I know he&#39;ll see it.  <br/>

&gt; So.  You know.  Dang.  What do you do with THAT????? <br/>
 </span></blockquote>===============<br/>
Well, my first response would be, &quot;well why would you want to?&quot; What a<br/>
bummer of a life to be picking all the battles (of anything) all the time!<br/>
<br/>
The other night my partner was super tired and woke up from an after<br/>
dinner spontaneous nap all grumpy. We had a few kids over and I could<br/>
tell he was feeling crowded and bugged by the video games and the<br/>
legos all over and stuff. He started directing the kids--the &quot;why are<br/>
you still playing games? All these toys need to be cleaned up.&quot; etc.<br/>
he wanted ds to write a note to the tooth fairy because we lost the<br/>
tooth and he thought a note should be written. wtf? <br/>
<br/>
So I took a breath and calmly talked to him pointing out how the kids<br/>
are just playing and &quot;how important is it?&quot; and why don&#39;t you just sit<br/>
and have a smoke and we can shut this door and visit with each other<br/>
for a while. And I listened to him about too much gaming and messy<br/>
house and how&#39;s our boy going to learn to write? and how we don&#39;t have<br/>
any schedules for laundry or dishes or dinner in our house and we<br/>
don&#39;t even brush our teeth everyday! And he brought up friends of our<br/>
son who have majorly scheduled lives who eat whatever&#39;s on the plate<br/>
in front of them and get dressed all by themselves etc etc. So I took<br/>
a turn and pointed out that those kids are have total problems<br/>
normally called &quot;not listening&quot; but it&#39;s more like they get no help<br/>
from their folks and it&#39;s the parents who aren&#39;t listening actually. I<br/>
said, here we have a boy who&#39;s really happy and trusts us and knows he<br/>
can depend on us. he wrote a letter to his friend when we sent them<br/>
some applesauce just the other day---of his own volition. I want him<br/>
to write when he wants to. He was so excited about his letter.<br/>
<br/>
I told him that I won&#39;t do stuff that jeopardizes the current trust<br/>
and love that we have with our boy. It&#39;s not the traditional<br/>
scheduling that makes a healthy family unit. It&#39;s how respectful we<br/>
can be in each moment with each other. Really. It&#39;s a moment to moment<br/>
thing for us. Luckily my partner was awake enough by that time or saw<br/>
the light or whatever. We put the plastic bag under the pillow for the<br/>
tooth fairy and had a good rest of the night. And I made a mental note<br/>
of his work schedule and when to schedule play dates so dp is less<br/>
likely to get overwhelmed.<br/>
<br/>
This is a little long...sorry. I&#39;ve got to go...breakfast time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1946951389">It sounds like your husband is much stressed and wants to exercise <br/>
his power.  I don&#39;t mean that in a bad way.  I mean that he needs to <br/>
see himself as effective in some area.  If he is frustrated with not <br/>
working and feels powerless in this way, this could be a big factor <br/>
in being tense all around. <br/>
<br/>

that make me really think that we are just too different to do this<br/>
together.<br/>
&lt;<br/>
For goodness sakes, then stop sending stuff for him to read.  My <br/>
husband would not read, discuss or ponder out loud anything with me <br/>
when it came to homeschooling or unschooling.  The more I pushed with <br/>
articles and books and quotes, the more he shut down and the grumpier <br/>
he got.  Ok, I didn&#39;t just push; I was some kind of fighter pilot on <br/>
a mission dropping bombs.  I can only imagine my husband when he saw <br/>
me.  Duck, cover  incoming!!!<br/>
<br/>
When I began applying the same principles of unschooling/mindful <br/>
parenting with my DH, only then did I see huge changes.  Things like, <br/>
trust.  Trust that he is doing his absolute best everyday.  Trust <br/>
that he wants the absolute best for his child.  Trust that he will <br/>
learn in time in HIS way.  Model the absolute best parenting for <br/>
him.  Be all the things you imagine you would like to see in him <br/>
without calling attention to it.  He is probably copying the <br/>
parenting style that was modeled for him from his parents.  Think of <br/>
modeling a new parenting style that he can consider. RELAX.  Relax <br/>
when he falters and says something to your daughter that makes you <br/>
cringe.  As Kelly Lovejoy says, consider that a `learning take&#39;. In <br/>
those moments, give him as much compassion as you would give your <br/>
child.  Don&#39;t put yourself in the middle as if you are some kind of <br/>
referee.  Trust your daughter too.  Children are made of tuff <br/>
stuff.   She will let her dad know in one way or another that he <br/>
needs a different approach (She will also let him know when he is <br/>
doing the right things.)   As much as we would like for things to be <br/>
perfect for our children, they can navigate this world just fine even <br/>
with a few bumps in the road.  You will likely get there quicker <br/>
however, the more YOU trust, model and relax.<br/>

The things he says now when he is in a stressed state and perhaps <br/>
feeling a little under the microscope are unlikely to be the things <br/>
he would say if he felt more trusted.  He may be quite aware of what <br/>
comments get under your skin.  If so, it is just his way of <br/>
saying, &quot;get off of my back, I&#39;m trying to figure this thing out <br/>
here.&quot;  I felt like ringing my DH&#39;s throat at times with some of the <br/>
things I heard him say.  And yes, I had the same thoughts that maybe <br/>
we are just too different to do this together.  Amazingly, all that <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-228022520">My 2 cents.<br/>
<br/>
Some of us dads (not all) have in the backs of our minds that our wives have<br/>
some secret agenda to &quot;change&quot; us.  (And this is not something that we will<br/>
own up to if asked, so don&#39;t.)  Whether or not this has any basis in reality<br/>
is beside the point.  If your DH has this burr under his saddle, then IMHO<br/>
this makes Dana&#39;s answer even more important.  Respect, trust, love.  That<br/>
can soften some of the worst rough spots.<br/>
<br/>
DW talks over ME.  Irritates the bojangles out of me.  Actually asked her if<br/>
she sometimes doesn&#39;t trust me to handle things.  This kept the conversation<br/>
away from &quot;I don&#39;t like the way you parent&quot; and focused it on &quot;Hey, we&#39;re<br/>
partners here.  I get to do the parenting, too.&quot;  I still have to remind her<br/>
in the moment sometimes that I&#39;m handling things.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-74595805">Thanks guys.  I appreciate all the kind words of wisdom, and I&#39;m<br/>
trying to change the way I deal with not only my kids but also my husband.<br/>
<br/>
Dana-- I should point out that I&#39;ve only sent him two emails.  One<br/>
only had one link (to the Parenting Pit) and the other had a list of<br/>
John Holt&#39;s books so he could look them up on eBay for me (at his<br/>
request), and the link to my blog.  He just doesn&#39;t ever want to<br/>
discuss parenting with me.  I guess the only thing left to do is just<br/>
to lead by example.  I am trying to put trust in him.  It&#39;s easier to<br/>
think that my kids are doing their best.  I KNOW that he ISN&#39;T doing<br/>
his best, but I have shifted focus away from &quot;He&#39;s not trying at all,&quot;<br/>
to &quot;Okay, he&#39;s trying some, that was definitely a sign of trying.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s still hard when we&#39;re all in the same space and my daughter (his<br/>
stepdaughter) is just BEING A KID and he&#39;s saying, &quot;No running no<br/>
jumping no singing no making ANY NOISE no playing around your brother<br/>
you&#39;re going to hurt him,&quot; etc.  She just looks at me like, &quot;What are<br/>
you going to do about this, Mom?&quot;  She&#39;s old enough to know what&#39;s up.  <br/>
<br/>
He does say things that he doesn&#39;t mean and I&#39;m trying to keep that in<br/>
mind as well.  <br/>
<br/>
Robert--  He DOES think I&#39;m trying to change him because he actually<br/>
told me that.  It&#39;s funny to me since I feel like I&#39;ve been very meek<br/>
in our relationship since the beginning.  I think it was the prenatal<br/>
and postpartum depression.  I feared many things, even my own husband.<br/>

long time to undo that damage.</div>
