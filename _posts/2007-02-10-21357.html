This may also explain why people want or need to slowly make the transition to unschooling or RU. Yes, they hear you saying, &quot;It works. It&#39;s wonderful. It&#39;s joyful,&quot; loud and clear. But from their perspective, if they follow your suggestions they are trusting total strangers. <br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s why I actively discourage people from asking &quot;what is the right<br/>
RU way?&quot;  Because I honestly believe that the discussion is simply a<br/>
springboard for internal examination, learning and growth.  The lists<br/>
aren&#39;t going to give you your answers, they are going to spark<br/>
thoughts and examination hopefully!!<br/>
<br/>
I would hate to think that anyone would come here and accept an RU<br/>
answer and trust that over the child sitting right in front of them.<br/>
But these lists HAVE changed lives (my own included) as we<br/>
internalized the philosophy being discussed by accessing it in our own<br/>
lives and examining what works and what doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
This list doesn&#39;t exist to give pat answers. It exists to discuss the<br/>
ideas and principles behind RU and why they&#39;ve worked in our own<br/>
lives. People truly have to find the answers within themselves and<br/>
their children or all the talk is meaningless.<br/>
<br/>
I think conferences are actually the best place for those big &quot;aha&quot;<br/>
moments, but it&#39;s a lot less accessible than an email list!:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1782302738">I actually considered including a line like, &quot;And their hearts, but we&#39;ve all had experiences where our hearts misled us/were broken&quot; or something like that, but couldn&#39;t get it to say what I really wanted and omitted it.  My basic point being that, yes, obviously it&#39;s one&#39;s heart leading one toward RU also but that following one&#39;s heart can seem pretty risky too and lead to the same questions -- what if I&#39;m wrong, what if this fails, will I be able to go back?<br/>

  Me:<br/>
  Isn&#39;t this every parent&#39;s fear about every important decision involving their children?<br/>
<br/>
  But, as Ren said:<br/>
<br/>
