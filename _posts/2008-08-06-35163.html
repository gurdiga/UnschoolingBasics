a video with some basic signs that&#39;s kids might want to use (mommy,<br/>
daddy, grandma, potty, cookie, juice...) It was fun and still comes in<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-410791832">Yup, my kids know probably 40 - 50 words that for us are whole sentences.<br/>
Like making an r with two hands and flicking them slightly forward for<br/>
asking if they are ready to go to, telling them it is time to go or them<br/>
telling me they want to go. Sign language for us is like a secret language<br/>
and since my son is into spy stuff right now it is all about secrets.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-332400260">Uh I&#39;d have to check, it was a LONG time ago. It was something like Kid<br/>
Sign but I&#39;m not sure.  There is also a website<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/browser.htm">http://commtechlab.msu.edu/sites/aslweb/browser.htm</a> that is pretty quick<br/>

the initial letter then scroll or type a word to find in the search -<br/>
sometimes it&#39;s fun to just scroll through and pick words at random) then<br/>
it gives a description of the sign and a video clip of someone using the<br/>
sign. Good for just looking up random words, doesn&#39;t give any sense of<br/>
the syntax of ASL or anything like that.<br/>
