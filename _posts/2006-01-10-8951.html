&gt;<br/>
&gt; I remembered your article about Children&#39;s right to Vote in the Life<br/>
&gt; Learning magazine. On Mothering.com, we are having a high level<br/>
&gt; discussion about the rights of children and their status as second<br/>
&gt; class citizens in our country. I would love to hear your eloquent pov<br/>
&gt; weighing in. :)<br/>

&gt; I appreciate if your plate is full and you aren&#39;t interested at this<br/>
&gt; time. Hope you are doing well. Thanks in advance for your<br/>
&gt; consideration.<br/>

conversation, but I can&#39;t get to the boards. Is it working for others?<br/>

  Not for me.  I did manage to get to the motheringdotcom discussion boards, but didn&#39;t find a category/thread that seemed to fit the topic -- and way too many current topics within categories to wade thru them all.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-570693510">Isabella Pinto has organized her own election tomorrow. Here&#39;s a bit<br/>
from the Waterbury Republican-American (Connecticut):<br/>
<br/>
Isabella Pinto, 8, was so disappointed to learn she was<br/>
too young to vote, she organized her own election.<br/>
<br/>
The young political junkie and contemporaries from her recently<br/>
launched Children&#39;s Right to Vote Committee on Tuesday will address<br/>
what they consider an injustice. They will oversee their own<br/>
presidential election, one open to even those born after iPods first<br/>
hit store shelves.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s not fair that we don&#39;t get to vote,&quot; said Isabella, an aspiring<br/>
commander-in-chief (and lawyer and scientist) from Thomaston. &quot;People<br/>
say &#39;We the people,&#39; and children are people, too.&quot;<br/>

I love the last bit of her quote. Children are able to make decisions<br/>
and both of my guys know they want to vote for Obama and why they want<br/>
to vote for him. At least this gives them a chance to vote.<br/>
<br/>
