<div id="ygrps-yiv-1646607194">Well, my family of origin issues with my 8 year old son are definitely getting more <br/>
challenging.  My parents live in a neighbouring island but we either go there or they come <br/>
here quite often.  And now my son is refusing to go visit them.  I understand why because <br/>
they are having a negative reaction to the straightforward nature of his communication <br/>
style and the fighting in his favourite game &#39;Pirates of the Caribbean Online&#39;.  <br/>
<br/>
My best friend always says &#39;God has a sense of humor&#39; and in this case she is right <br/>
because I was not supportive of video games for quite a while.  And now I am getting hit <br/>
with similar statements to what I would think - although not say - when other people&#39;s <br/>
children were immersed in video games.  Both my mother and my brother were trying to <br/>
engage me in this negative conversation about technology today.  I didn&#39;t engage because <br/>
I was trying to organize a ride for my son, daughter and I since my son got very angry <br/>
about the negative statements and wanted to leave right away.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, my 3 year old daughter and I, on the other hand, both enjoy seeing my parents.  <br/>
They are amazing about other things that we have in common - Reiki, Toltec philosophy, <br/>
dietary choices, and much more.  Right now going separate ways is doable because my <br/>
husband is in town.<br/>
<br/>
Any experiences of this kind of &#39;different desire by children to interact with extended <br/>
family&#39; thing?   I really have no interest in changing my parents&#39; mind about video games, <br/>
hairstyle, no-chores, and other choices in our household.  But I guess that I am still <br/>
holding on to some lingering hope that they will treat my son with more respect.  Anyone <br/>
had that shift take place?  Any links to useful articles or posts?   <br/>
Thanks<br/>

P.S. Apologies for any fuzzy communication since I have someone on my lap waiting to <br/>
use the computer and someone on the sofa waiting to use it too.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-903645947">I started to write on many of the topics being discussed today but this one<br/>
won. Video games are much of our curriculum from the map reading of Spiro to<br/>
actual educational games.  There are books out about how video games are<br/>
educational and curriculum devoted to making video games even more<br/>
educational but when dealing with family what you need is something short<br/>
and to the point. Here is a good article and to the left a bunch of related<br/>
information and articles about video games.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
There is even a related article that states that scientists say we need more<br/>
video games because they teach higher thinking.<br/>
