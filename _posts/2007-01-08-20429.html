<div id="ygrps-yiv-913106830">OK, I have to say that not brushing your teeth EVER is just<br/>
disgusting. Now, I know that kids&#39; mouths are different than adults<br/>
but ?I can&#39;t imagine that the bacteria doesn&#39;t eventually grow to<br/>
dangerous levels. I know that if my son doesn&#39;t brush his tongue every<br/>
couple of days, it looks disgusting and his breath just stinks!! Kids<br/>
(like many adults) may not understand or care about the consequences<br/>
but the are very real - danger of rotting teeth, full body infection<br/>
(this is more common than most people realize), and people not wanting<br/>
to be around you. <br/>
<br/>
Beyond that, in terms of teeth and decay, obviously it&#39;s more than<br/>
just sugar that does it. But sugar is a big factor. It readily sticks<br/>
to the gums and teeth and is a perfect food to help the bacteria grow.<br/>
But chewing sugarless gum can help get rid of a lot of the sugar - it<br/>
increases the saliva production and helps to break down the sugars,<br/>
which you just swallow with your saliva. A lot of dentists now<br/>
recommend this to parents for many kids who have had bad luck with<br/>
cavities at a young age and it&#39;s not just for candy and chocolate -<br/>
but for anything with high sugar content, including fruits. Swishing<br/>
water in the mouth helps as well. Sometime this is better because the<br/>
water can go through the spaces between teeth. <br/>
<br/>
We are not the greatest with teeth brushing (well, I am because I have<br/>
health problems and can&#39;t afford any addition possibility of infection<br/>
through my mouth) . As long as the kids brush at least once a day, I&#39;m<br/>
happy. They usually choose night time, but sometimes they will<br/>
remember to brush in the morning too. And sometimes if they&#39;re really<br/>
tired they won&#39;t brush at night. But I also buy mouth washes that they<br/>
like to use (both the flouride ones and the staining ones). IT<br/>
motivates them to brush and I&#39;m assuming (though maybe wrongly so)<br/>
that the alcohol in it must kill at least some of the germs in the mouth.<br/>

Yes, but that&#39;s a societal thing. The Native Americans didn&#39;t brush.<br/>
From what I&#39;ve read, many of them had very thick layers of plaque<br/>
covering their teeth, yet their teeth were very healthy. A lot of our<br/>
ideas about hygeine aren&#39;t really about safety or health...just<br/>

so if it can why  take that chance? especially since gum disease also makes <br/>
breath stinky!  (always true) and if you say that some people might not think <br/>
it  smells bad, then that&#39;s just too funny because the closest thing to the  <br/>
smell of true gum disease breath are POOP and garbage and I don&#39;t think  anyone <br/>
wants to smell those things!<br/>

Plaque *can* lead to gum disease but many people who have had plaque and do <br/>
not have gum disease belie your declaration of absolutes.<br/>
<br/>
Gum disease *can* lead to other infection or illness but many people who <br/>
have gum disease do not have and will not get heart disease, cancer, <br/>
diabetes, blah, blah, blah and so your statement is another exaggeration.<br/>
<br/>
Most unschoolers will not have organ transplants.<br/>

it isn&#39;t extreme at all to link heart disease and blood  problems to bad <br/>
teeth. just talk to a periodontal surgeon. my better  half&#39;s mom is one so he <br/>
hears about it all the time. gum disease  prevention and general disease <br/>
prevention have (in the medical field)  become very closely related! <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
also, my son was born with the possibility of needing a new liver  some day <br/>
and it was him I was talking about.<br/>
 <br/>
in regards to the &quot;rotted out tooth should have been  addressed long before <br/>
it became a problem&quot; comment. It was a filled tooth  not only filled but <br/>
covered with that stuff that they use to make molars  more flat and less prone to <br/>
getting gunk in them (don&#39;t know the name). It  looked great to me and the <br/>
dentist from the outside. I made the error  of limiting the amount of xrays they <br/>
take (I hate the idea of lots of  radiation) and they didn&#39;t detect it on time. <br/>
My son didn&#39;t talk about any  pain. One day his cheek was huge and that was <br/>
the day we took him in and  realized an abscess had formed. It was not visible <br/>
until the cheek swelled  and then they did the xray and everything became very <br/>
clear. <br/>
 <br/>
I have a regret about getting that tooth filled to begin  with and now feel <br/>
that with baby cavities and molars, and extraction (with  a spacer, if needed) <br/>
makes more sense. but dentists are very slow to want  to extract these days <br/>
because of orthodontic concerns. <br/>

Life itself is full of chance.<br/>
Jumping out of an airplane can lead to death.<br/>
The risk can be drastically reduced by wearing a well packed and in good repair parachute, taking classes, joining email lists to hear other&#39;s experience of skydiving, and many other things.<br/>
Again, loads of choices between jumping with no thought and complete avoidance of planes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-11589480">Well , heres my two cents on the whole teeth brushing , teeth falling <br/>
out, candy ordeal. Plain and simple really but oh well here it <br/>
goes...my children brush their teeth not because I talked them into it, <br/>
not becuase they were TOLD to , not becuase I told them their teeth <br/>
would rot out, but simply becuase at an early age they saw me brushing <br/>
my teeth and caring for MY teeth because I like to have white teeth, <br/>
sooooo they brush their teeth. I beleive that certain &quot;habits&quot; are <br/>
learned habits and I think teeth brushing is one of em. It doesnt <br/>
matter how much candy you eat or how many apples you down. I brush my <br/>
teeth becuase it feels good, done and done, and so do my kidlets. My <br/>
son will go a day without brushing and then NEED to brush becuase he <br/>
doesnt like the feel of scum on his teeth...Its never evne been an <br/>
issue here , but it has just always been something we all do together. <br/>

hmmm, I see it another way. I don&#39;t know that many  people who homeschool yet <br/>
I know of several who chose to do so just  because their child was <br/>
chronically ill or had a severe illness (like  cancer) and being enrolled in school was <br/>
either troubling for the  family or near impossible. Of those people, a few <br/>
have  tried various methods of homeschooling, including  unschooling. <br/>

son will go a day without brushing and then NEED to brush becuase he<br/>

<br/>
Same here.<br/>
But out of four children, only one really LOVES the feel of clean<br/>
teeth, the two older boys (who have NO cavities of course) will go for<br/>
a couple days before noticing and my youngest has a lot of<br/>
sensitivities and has never liked the feel of tooth brushing. <br/>
We buy him a lot of different toothbrushes and yummy toothpastes to<br/>
try and make it more desirable for him because he does have tooth decay.<br/>
<br/>
For most kids, brushing with them and making it a time to connect and<br/>
be together is enough.<br/>

I TOTALLY misunderstood your post.<br/>
<br/>
What I thought you were saying by &quot;most unschoolers wont recieve a <br/>

have one.<br/>
<br/>
I thought you were saying that unschooling people tend to not <br/>

I was on the wrong track.<br/>

&gt; address our concerns about our kids health while still respecting our<br/>
&gt; kids autonomy?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>By holding up fears to critical examination. By asking how others  <br/>
have dealt with the practical matters. By reading what really happens  <br/>
rather than what we fear will happen.  By asking how others have  <br/>
handled the fear.<br/>
<br/>
A good question to ask when a child wants to do something that makes  <br/>
you uncomfortable is &quot;Who is going to die if he does this *one* thing?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think part of the problem is that often the responses here seem to  <br/>
dismiss the fear as though it were nothing to be concerned about. As  <br/>
an example, I think many of the posts about brushing not being the be  <br/>
all and end all of cavity prevention come across as though the poster  <br/>
were saying &quot;Brushing isn&#39;t important. If they brush, fine, if they  <br/>
don&#39;t brush, fine too.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But what people are trying to do is help people approach a problem  <br/>
calmly and rationally without the fear driving them. There are many  <br/>
solutions to the issues kids have with brushing. (Brushing together,  <br/>
using just water, different toothpastes, and so on and so on.) But  <br/>
it&#39;s much easier to see new solutions and try ones suggested if  <br/>
parents do it from a position of knowledge rather than fear.<br/>
<br/>
Some kids *will* be more prone to cavities but that&#39;s not a reason to  <br/>
treat all kids as though that were true. Some kids may never get  <br/>
cavities regardless of their brushing frequency but that&#39;s not a  <br/>
reason to treat all kids as though that were true.<br/>
<br/>
If we give them *real* information it will help them make better more  <br/>
informed decisions. Real information is &quot;Brushing will help most  <br/>
people prevent cavities.&quot; If we treat their objections seriously and  <br/>
with real respect, they will come to understand that we&#39;re trying to  <br/>
help them. And we can better do that when we don&#39;t fear that a day or  <br/>
a week or even a month without brushing means their teeth will rot.  <br/>
We can help them better if we aren&#39;t hovering over them impatiently  <br/>
waiting for them to show they&#39;ve made the &quot;right&quot; decision by  <br/>
brushing their teeth everyday.<br/>

justifications for making kids do what will ease mom&#39;s fears.<br/>
<br/>
Your mother in law is obviously biased because she sees an inordinate  <br/>
number of worst case scenarios because of her profession so it seems  <br/>
way more common than it is.<br/>
<br/>
My brother in law as an LA cop views teens as potential criminals  <br/>
because he deals with a disproportionate number of teens who are  <br/>
criminals.<br/>
<br/>
Neither of them is seeing the overwhelming majority of non-worst case  <br/>
scenarios.<br/>

We can live in fear that a meteor could hit our house. It *could*  <br/>
happen. But it&#39;s highly unlikely and that fear will prevent us from  <br/>

asking people what they would have done or what other options there  <br/>

<br/>
The advice isn&#39;t meant to solve everyone&#39;s problems but to help  <br/>
people -- who are here asking for that kind of help -- to start  <br/>
thinking in new ways so that more respectful solutions become more  <br/>
natural and the norm in their lives to help unschooling flourish.<br/>

without a bath or a shower, and nobody is the wiser.  I shower 3-4 times<br/>
a week.  I remember growing up in a rural community where our family was<br/>
on well water and we had full baths or showers once per week.   It cuts<br/>
down on water consumption bills, too :)  But no, we don&#39;t deny them<br/>
baths either haha.  They enjoy their baths, but sometimes they or I are<br/>
just not in the mood to get wet :)<br/>

********<br/>
Not bathing doesn&#39;t always have the effects you are stating. My youndest son, 7 1/2 takes a bath maybe once a week. He doesn&#39;t smell, there&#39;s no crusties. He also has not washed his hair in months, after almost a year without washing. He has shiny untangled sweet smelling brown hair with golden highlights. Nothing greasy. An adult woman I know decided to eliminate hair prodects from her life and after an initial adjustment period (I think it was about 3 weeks?), her hair reverted to it&#39;s natural state, clean, shiny and healthy. <br/>
Sometimes bad breath is caused by other problems, rather than brushing issues. Certain diseases can be indicated by bad breath.<br/>

<br/>
Same here. My five year old varies between not bathing for days on<br/>
end, then going into a stage where he wants to shower twice a day.<br/>
<br/>
Right now he&#39;s getting clean by playing in the snow. I figure any<br/>
water or snow type play gets some cleaning done.:)  Until kids hit the<br/>
teen years, there really isn&#39;t any smell associated with not bathing.<br/>
My teens might get a reminder if their B.O. is getting nasty. &quot;Hey,<br/>
have you showered in a while?&quot; reminds them that they DO indeed have a<br/>
scent. It&#39;s just not that big of a deal, and we&#39;re pretty clean people<br/>
over all.<br/>
<br/>
And now, I&#39;m going to make a cuppa tea and watch two of my kids enjoy<br/>
the first real snow of the season...YIPPEEE! (yes, I&#39;m too lazy to<br/>
bundle up and go outside this morning).<br/>
