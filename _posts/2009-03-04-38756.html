<div id="ygrps-yiv-2109440317">There are some less motion-intensive games on Roblox, it&#39;s just a<br/>
matter of finding them I think. I&#39;d have to ask DH and DS about them.<br/>
Oh, yeah, some are more &quot;building&quot; oriented rather than the running<br/>
around type &quot;obbys&quot; and such (an &quot;obby&quot; for non-Robloxians, is an<br/>
obstacle course). Those might be somewhat doable - I&#39;ve been able to<br/>
watch them for short times, as long as there&#39;s not a lot of people in<br/>
that one game. I&#39;ll see if DH or DS have any good &#39;places&#39; that they&#39;ve<br/>
built that aren&#39;t too motion-busy. Maybe that would be a good project<br/>
for DH - he&#39;s getting into the guts and programming stuff from scratch.<br/>
