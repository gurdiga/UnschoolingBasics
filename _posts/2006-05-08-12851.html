to stay up late to get my important chores done before bed and it was <br/>
so quiet in the house and it felt so good in the mornings when I was <br/>
all set in my &quot;head&quot; to play all day!!  Its like my head is clearer <br/>
when the chores are done.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1114427612">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
This is something I have a hard time with.  I feel like I should get everything I need to do out of the way before I can have any fun.  I am a perfectionist (something I have been working on getting rid of) and it is very hard for me to look at a messy house.  Anyone have any suggestions to help me change my mindset.  I feel my priorities are wrong.  I have come a long way in the last year, but still have a &quot;ways&quot;  to go!<br/>
