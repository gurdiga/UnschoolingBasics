I&#39;m sorry you feel personally attacked and criticized. When I first <br/>
started learning about unschooling, I read more than I posted and <br/>
that helped me not take anything personal. I hope you stick around.<br/>

<br/>
**But pointing out that it&#39;s important to share honest information with our<br/>
children and to trust them to make choices for themselves IS spelling out<br/>
how unschooling philosophies are different from other philosophies.  Honesty<br/>
and trust are heart and soul of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not personal.  I understand it feels personal, but it&#39;s about the ideas<br/>
you&#39;ve brought up, not *you*.  I&#39;ve been on this list since it began.  I&#39;m a<br/>
moderator.  I know a bunch of these people personally. If I came on and said<br/>
that I told my daughter Rowan that she had to be married before she could<br/>
have a baby, believe me, people would take that up for discussion!<br/>
<br/>
I hope you&#39;ll keep reading about unschooling - if not here, on other lists<br/>
and sites.  It&#39;s a wonderful way to live.   ~Rue<br/>

You know, that seems to come as a surprise to a lot of people! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Really, you weren&#39;t asking questions so much as you were telling us <br/>
what you did. Volunteering to us stories about your kids and your <br/>
parenting.<br/>
<br/>
Have you examined what we wrote? Does it make any sense?<br/>
<br/>
Does it make any sense to others who have read???<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And about being gifted, I first learned of the term unschooling<br/>
through multiple aquaintences who are gifted or have gifted children.<br/>

<br/>
Well, many of us (and/or our children) have been/would have been/could <br/>
be labeled as &quot;gifted&quot; with the common definition of the word.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling, though, sees each person as unique. Giftedness only occurs <br/>
when used in comparing one person to another.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re not comparing, so the word &quot;gifted&quot; is simply unnecessary in our <br/>
world!<br/>
<br/>
--=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Ah, but yes, I made an error in judgment.  I thought this was a<br/>
support group.  Apparently you have no such intention.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Right, And you&#39;re not the first to think that---nor will you be the <br/>
last. And if you hang around long enough (and usually that&#39;s not very <br/>
long at all! &lt;g&gt;), you will giggle when it comes around on the guitar <br/>
again!<br/>

<br/>
I did not expect that I would not be met with opposing viewpoints but<br/>
I would have hoped that they would be offered in a respectful,<br/>
&quot;joyful&quot; manner, considering that a &quot;joyful&quot; life is your professed<br/>
goal.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well, I guess that depends on *how* you read posts. I read &quot;joyful&quot; and <br/>
&quot;respectful&quot; and &quot;helpful&quot; in most posts.<br/>
<br/>
Just because *you* are fighting it doesn&#39;t mean the message isn&#39;t <br/>
getting through to someone else---joyfully and respectfully.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something I just stole from another list:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The list is about ideas, not about people.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Think of ideas like balls and the list like a ball court. If someone<br/>
tosses an idea worth discussing into the court it&#39;s going to get<br/>
batted about. At that point what&#39;s going on is no longer about the<br/>
person who tossed the idea in. It&#39;s about the idea and how well and<br/>
cleanly it&#39;s being tossed about. (Unless the tosser keeps jumping in<br/>
and grabbing the idea ball saying &quot;Mine!&quot;)&quot;   ~Joyce Fetteroll, genius <br/>
that she is<br/>
<br/>
The advice/criticism you received may not put a dent in the way you <br/>
parent. Chances *are*, it will! &lt;g&gt; BUT if it makes at least one other <br/>
reader examine *her* parenting/lifestyle/thinking, then the list is <br/>
working.<br/>
<br/>
This really isn&#39;t an easy concept to grasp. It can be very stressful to <br/>
examine all you hold dear. And it can be very painful to change the way <br/>
you&#39;re acting/thinking/being.<br/>
<br/>
But newbies get it every day! And their lives and the lives of their <br/>
children improve dramatically! Really!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1163853228">Just hang in, read and try to listen to what&#39;s being discussed.  I am new<br/>
here myself and this philosophy requires a new train of thought.  Even<br/>
though it goes against everything I was taught, I believe the responses<br/>
given are profoundly clear as well as purposefully blunt and to the point.<br/>

would be a tremendous waste of precious time and a disservice to inquiries<br/>

were 10 and 7 years old. I was a member of CAG (California  <br/>
Association for the Gifted) and I attended conference, read  <br/>
everything I could get my hands on and was a strong booster for  <br/>
&quot;gifted education.&quot;<br/>

That doesn&#39;t mean people have said &quot;you are right&quot;, but that people have helped guide me <br/>
in the right direction for unschooling.  I don&#39;t post often, but I read the posts almost every <br/>
day, and usually the posts change something in my thinking which was keeping us away <br/>
from totally unschooling.  That doesn&#39;t mean it is easy, our whole lives are changing, BUT <br/>
it IS amazing.  Stick around, if you post something expect people to tell you how it fits (or <br/>
doesn&#39;t fit) into the unschooling basics, which is why I am here!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1195309708">The longer we&#39;re free of the school system, the more I see things <br/>
differently such as the labels &quot;gifted&quot; and &quot;learning disabled&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
My two oldest had the &quot;learning disabled&quot; noose hung on them for <br/>
many years while in school, even before the adoption. My youngest <br/>
was the opposite...&quot;advanced&quot; was something I heard a lot from the <br/>
teachers, when she was in school. <br/>
<br/>
But disabled as compared to what? Gifted by whose standards? <br/>
Aren&#39;t they in fact just being themselves? Why does the school <br/>
system think we all have to move through life at the same pace as <br/>
others our own age? <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know anything about cars, except how to drive one. I don&#39;t <br/>
know a Toyota from a Mazda, let alone all the different models. I <br/>
don&#39;t know what a carborator looks like, I&#39;m not sure what it&#39;s <br/>
function is and I don&#39;t think I even spelled it correctly. <br/>
My son does though. He knows much more about how a car works than I <br/>
do. He can look at most cars and tell what model it is and he knows <br/>
the names of all the new cars that are coming out. He knows what the <br/>
names of most car parts are and their function also. Does that make <br/>
him gifted and me learning disabled? <br/>
<br/>
My middle child knows a lot about horses. She knows how to ride <br/>
them, feed them, groom them. She knows the names of the different <br/>
breeds and is learning how to train them. Me? I know nothing about <br/>
horses except that when I get to close to one, I sneeze. Is she <br/>
gifted in horses? Am I learning disabled in horses? <br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that children are &quot;rewarded&quot; with the gifted label <br/>
when they can learn within the way the schools are designed for them <br/>
to learn. Children are degraded with the learning disabled label <br/>
when they don&#39;t. That has nothing to do with the real world. When a <br/>
school fails to teach a child they way that child needs to be <br/>
taught, the child is labled a failure, when in actuality, the <br/>
responsibility should be on the school. <br/>
<br/>
If my youngest was still in school, she&#39;d be beyond children her <br/>
age, but is she gifted? No, she&#39;s just being herself. She&#39;s exactly <br/>
where she should be, just being Jacqueline. <br/>
As a matter of fact, I&#39;m thrilled for her that she&#39;ll never be <br/>
labeled &quot;gifted&quot;. <br/>
I would never want her to think that living down to (not living up <br/>
to) a failing, broken down school system is what makes one &quot;gifted&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
I want my children to repect their individuality and go through life <br/>
at their own pace, not being compared to others. <br/>
