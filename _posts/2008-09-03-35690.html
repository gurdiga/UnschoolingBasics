Also, he is interested in Physics/Quantum physics. I was thinking of <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1927070046">Kim, I don&#39;t know if you are new to this list. <br/>
First many of the regular posters are at the Live and Learn Conference in Black Mountain ,NC this week including the<br/>
two owners of this list.<br/>
How long have you been uschooling your son and how long have you been reading here?<br/>
I ask that because I seems like what you understand as unschooling success would be you son picking  up<br/>
school and text books and doing schoolish &quot;work&quot;. That is far from our goal as unschoolers.<br/>
Of course if that was his choice that would be fine and you should support him but you are the wants that wants it.<br/>
Have you read  this two sites:<br/>
 <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/</a><br/>
 <br/>
and<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/">http://sandradodd.com/</a><br/>
 <br/>
lots of great things too read and soak up!<br/>
I read what you son likes to watch and do and it sounds great! <br/>
Another point I want to make is that unschooling is not letting you child all alone to fend for herself.<br/>
You need to support his interests, be involved, provide opportunities ( when welcomed), expose him to the world, new ideas,<br/>
model by following your passions and more. <br/>
 <br/>
Of course all that would not be  uschooling without trusting that your child will learn what he needs to learn, when he needs and is ready to learn.<br/>
 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1381212131">If he decides he wants to go to college, why can&#39;t he learn it then?  <br/>
That&#39;s what many public schooled kids do anyway, get to college, take  <br/>
remedial courses, and then move on. Colleges are more and more  <br/>
looking at nontraditional students...adults who went straight into  <br/>
the workforce after school, military, and homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
I feel like if kids WANT something, they will do it in their time. If  <br/>
he wants college, he can do the SAT prep and go. If he wants to be a  <br/>
crab fisherman, awesome. Why fill his life with things that have no  <br/>
meaning for fear of the future? Can you imagine a transcript that  <br/>
says he learned quantum physics off the coast of the Aleutian  <br/>
Islands? He&#39;ll know more about history, government, math, logic than  <br/>
most of incoming freshmen. The election is modern history...have you  <br/>
brought up how this election is similar to previous ones because of  <br/>
a, b or c? The historical significance of having a black man run for  <br/>
president when just a few years ago there was a string of hangings  <br/>
and killings...how to rectify the civil rights movement ....is he  <br/>
interested in THAT part of the elections?<br/>
<br/>
Eh, I&#39;m on bedrest and not doing good so I might be running on and  <br/>
on. It makes sense to me but my reality is blurring. I hope it makes  <br/>
sense to you, it sounds to me like he&#39;s doing so MUCH. He wants so  <br/>
MUCH. How about a trip to Alaska with the fam to see what crab  <br/>
fishing really looks like outside of editing?<br/>

This sounds like a bright child to me LOL!! He knows what he wants!<br/>
<br/>
If one wants to study physics and quantum pyhsics badly, he will get <br/>
into all those Maths that he needs. <br/>
<br/>
Iming and emailing? Is it handwriting, or is it putting thoughts <br/>
onto paper? In my other list, someone wrote &quot;just because someone <br/>
writes well does not mean that they can express themselves, and just <br/>
because someone cannot write don&#39;t means that they cannot <br/>
communicate or express themselves&quot;. Our kids will probably be typing <br/>
and voice recognition in the future. I believe int he future, <br/>
handwriting will be a form of artistry. Looking back, to have <br/>
perfect handwriting was necessary because not everyone have a some <br/>
sort of typing/ printing machine. Hence handwriting will be the most <br/>
common form of communication. We don&#39;t even write cheques now, <br/>
surely this is telling us that neatly sized handwriting is no longer <br/>
a pre-requisite, unless you&#39;re a student in a classroom. Even in <br/>
today&#39;s classroom, we&#39;re using an electronic white board, with <br/>
lessons keyed into the teachers laptop. Even the teacher type in her <br/>
work. <br/>
<br/>
Election? As in politics? I do wonder what is he learning?<br/>
<br/>
This really does sound like &quot;a kid with a strategy in mind&quot; to me. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1987431387">I love the idea of going to Alaska so he can see first hand what goes <br/>
on...I hadn&#39;t thought of that.<br/>
<br/>
I do encourage him to do what he likes and not just go to college for <br/>
the sake of going.  I just worry sometimes that it will hurt him in <br/>
the future for not having done something in his High School years.<br/>
<br/>
I also know that he gets a lot of knowledge from watching the <br/>
different shows thats why I would like to put them together into <br/>
a &quot;class&quot; for his transcript.  We discuss a lot of stuff, however, my <br/>
history knowledge is pretty thin.  I always had trouble in school <br/>
with it and never had an interest. Can Current Events be a class????  <br/>
He is actually very passionate about the election this year, I am <br/>
wanting to have him volunteer so he can at least do something since <br/>
he can&#39;t vote.  We do discuss the issues as well and I explain why <br/>
this is an important year.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

haven&#39;t already.  Nag&#39;s Head off the coast of Virginia or NC (don&#39;t remember<br/>
which) was good crab fishing a couple of decades ago.  I don&#39;t know what<br/>
it&#39;s like now.  I&#39;d find out before I went in case the ocean life is<br/>
different now if crab fishing were my goal.  If you&#39;re on the West Coast, I<br/>
have no idea where to start but you could ask around.<br/>

whether it&#39;s volunteering somewhere, taking community-based courses, <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Why would the study of chemical interactions be necessary prior to <br/>
studying about the movements of bodies and energy? As soon as a wee <br/>
tot drops peas off their high chair tray, they are learning about <br/>
physics... I took biology, &quot;earth science&quot; (weather, minerals, etc), <br/>
and two years of high school chemistry, never took physics. I know <br/>
other folks who took two years of biology prior to physics and never <br/>
took chemistry. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; something like consumar math, algebra, geometry.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why in that order? That&#39;s a &#39;typical&#39; school order to things but why <br/>
that order? For that matter, I know of places where geometry goes <br/>
before algebra and some places that split algebra into two sections <br/>
with geometry in between. <br/>
<br/>
The reality is that algebra and geometry and &quot;consumer math&quot; (ack, <br/>
hate that term) are all inter-related...everything is connected to <br/>
everything else. They aren&#39;t walled off into separate &quot;subjects&quot;. For <br/>
instance, if you want to build a simple wooden box you need geometry <br/>
to figure out the area of each side so you can get the proper amount <br/>
of wood. You need &quot;consumer math&quot; to calculate price per sq foot and <br/>
check for discounts (5% discount if you buy x amount of sq ft). And <br/>
you need algebra to calculate misc bits and pieces of the <br/>
project...algebra is finding an unknown based on known information. <br/>
You need 4 nails per side on the 4 inch sq sides and 3 per side on <br/>
the 3 inch sq sides. You&#39;ve got 3 sides and the bottom that are 4 <br/>
inches and one side that is 3 inches and no top so how many nails do <br/>
you need? That&#39;s algebra. Then you need MORE &quot;consumer math&quot; to <br/>
figure out the cost of the nails. It&#39;s all bundled together...and <br/>
interwoven into it are things like art, design, &quot;shop&quot; skills like <br/>
hammering a nail and using a saw, and how to choose the wood for the <br/>
project, plus whatever the project is &#39;for&#39; - is it a gift for a <br/>
family traditional holiday or event? that&#39;d be culture and possibly <br/>
history and such. is it an animal shelter of some sort? what animal? <br/>
is it the right sort of shelter? Now you&#39;re getting into animal <br/>
husbandry, anatomy, biology. Is it to store snacks? what kind of <br/>
snacks? does it actually need a hinged top to keep out small <br/>
creatures? more animal issues, possibly more calculations, as well as <br/>
nutrition concepts with the snacks.<br/>
<br/>
You might do well to just discuss with your son what HIS goals are <br/>
and how you can assist him in reaching those goals (he may request <br/>
access to formal situations, he may not...he might just want you to <br/>
check on how he can get to visit a local university&#39;s physics <br/>
department to talk with someone or possibly a membership to a serious <br/>
level science museum or maybe just take him someplace he can throw <br/>
stuff around and see what happens without denting the living room). <br/>
<br/>
BTW most newer RPGs have built in seriously intensive physics <br/>
processing algorithms so that when you throw something or hit <br/>
something, it reacts &quot;naturally&quot; as if you actually threw or hit the <br/>
object in real life. So, his RPG playing is actually feeding his <br/>
interest in physics more safely than throwing things around the <br/>
house :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1793837385">I kinda felt that way to. I took biology and anatomy in High school. <br/>
but I want him to study what he is interested in.  I gave him a <br/>
credit for astronomy for freshman year because that was most of what <br/>
he studied. via cosmos and universe series.  though he told me the <br/>
cosmos show is more on theory than actual facts but it is still <br/>
interesting.<br/>
<br/>
I dont care what order math follows....just going to put it in the <br/>
transcript in an order.  but I have difficulty in seeing math in <br/>
simple daily activities.  Thanks for the ideas though.<br/>
<br/>
I did research the alaska idea and there is a tour you can go on for <br/>
3 hours so that would be fun to plan.<br/>
<br/>
We live in Indiana by the way so any crab fishing is going to involve <br/>
a fam trip.<br/>
<br/>
he is currently playing conquer online and dungeon and dragons. he <br/>
ims with the other players as well.  but he spends a lot of time on <br/>
the games.....should i try to encourage him to do other things to or <br/>
is that pushing my ideas on him???<br/>

I was thinking of looking at the textbooks so I have an idea of what <br/>
is covered so I can apply it to non textbook life<br/>

&gt; &gt; That&#39;s what many public schooled kids do anyway, get to college,<br/>
&gt; take<br/>
&gt; &gt; remedial courses, and then move on. Colleges are more and more<br/>
&gt; &gt; looking at nontraditional students...adults who went straight into<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I feel like if kids WANT something, they will do it in their time.<br/>
&gt; If<br/>
&gt; &gt; he wants college, he can do the SAT prep and go. If he wants to be<br/>

&gt; &gt; crab fisherman, awesome. Why fill his life with things that have<br/>
&gt; no<br/>
&gt; &gt; meaning for fear of the future? Can you imagine a transcript that<br/>
&gt; &gt; says he learned quantum physics off the coast of the Aleutian<br/>

&gt; &gt; brought up how this election is similar to previous ones because<br/>

&gt; &gt; a, b or c? The historical significance of having a black man run<br/>

&gt; &gt; president when just a few years ago there was a string of hangings<br/>
&gt; &gt; and killings...how to rectify the civil rights movement ....is he<br/>

&gt; makes<br/>

of a lot of things.  If you think about it, it&#39;s a career for all those<br/>
reporters out there.  Whether or not something is a class is moot point.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He sounds like he has his own interests and you have little to worry over.<br/>
Read the archives on lots of new unschoolers with kids just out of school.<br/>
Usually they need time away from other&#39;s influence in order to figure out<br/>
what they&#39;re interested in because after being told for so long, they have<br/>
no idea what they want.<br/>
<br/>
*You* want your child to volunteer.  Is he interested?  Discussion of the<br/>
issues can be very interesting and enlightening... are you learning anything<br/>
new yourself?  It seems like the focus is not just sharing information with<br/>
each other but it&#39;s more like a spotlight trained onto your child while you<br/>
explain why something is important.  Does it seem to you like that&#39;s what&#39;s<br/>
going on?  Or am I overstating something?<br/>

and keep attendance records, though there is no special form for these  <br/>
records, which are, as the code states, &quot;kept solely to verify the  <br/>
enrollment and attendance of any particular child upon request of the  <br/>
state superintendent of public instruction.&quot; Homeschools must provide  <br/>
instruction equivalent to that given in the public schools, but, as  <br/>
stated on the DOE website, &quot;state law does not define equivalency of  <br/>
instruction.&quot; Further, &quot;state law exempts home schools from the  <br/>
curriculum and program requirements which public schools must follow.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t need to be doing anything in particular to satisfy your  <br/>
state law. You don&#39;t need to be creating transcripts or keeping records.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re doing it for the possibility of college in the future, you  <br/>
need to know more about colleges and entrance requirements.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re in California - my kids did NOTHING that remotely resembled high  <br/>
school, we kept NO records or portfolio and created no transcripts or  <br/>
grade reports of any kind.<br/>
<br/>
One has graduated from college, one is going full time to college, the  <br/>
third has been taking a college course here and there.<br/>
<br/>
They used the community college route - there are no entrance  <br/>
requirements so they go to the cc for a while and then transfer to the  <br/>
4-year college or university, using the community college transcript  <br/>
and with no need for any high school transcript at all.<br/>
<br/>
Looks like Indiana has a system of community colleges with open  <br/>
admissions, as well - &quot;Ivy Tech.&quot;<br/>

a well rounded transcript.***<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A transcript is a record of what a person has studied. Your son will probably not need a transcript.   If he does you can write one.   The transcript you write will be a record of what he took an interest in, not what he &quot;studied&quot;.    Since he will probably not need a transcript you can relax and put it out of your mind. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
***Any thoughts on how to cover/encourage<br/>
all the subjects would be appreciated.***<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
First, what are all the subjects?  All the subjects in the world?   List those for us, would you? &lt;g&gt;   All the subjects in your head?  All the subjects in school?   No one ever covers all the subjects.  I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll live long enough to cover all the subjects.&lt;g&gt;    Schools pick a few subjects and do a bad job of delivering information about them.  And they do a lot of harm.   <br/>
<br/>
If a person wakes up in the morning and gets out of bed there&#39;s a pretty good chance that during the course of the day that person will encounter all the things schools are calling &quot;subjects.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
If a person wakes up and gets out of bed three hundred sixty five days a year they&#39;re ahead of the school which requires a kid look in several books a few hours a day for a hundred eighty days.  <br/>
<br/>
Think about that.  The official learning of a kid in school would look like a few pages from five or six (poorly written)  books each day and some yackity yack from a teacher who&#39;d probably rather be home working in his garage.    Kids who have the opportunity and who have the attention of their parents will naturally and easily find more interesting and worthwhile things to do with their time.  <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s nothing magic in those books.  Nothing that will make your kid smarter or better prepared or more interesting to college admissions people. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
***Presently, he wants to be a crab fisherman in alaska...like deadliest<br/>
catch.***<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could send away to Alaska for brochures and info, you know, the stuff they send to tourists and he could browse that.   There are some websites for Alaska fishing jobs, if he hasn&#39;t looked at those he might like them.  Lot&#39;s of photos there.          <br/>

I am ok with unschooling as he doesn&#39;t really do well with formal<br/>
curriculum.  I just want to make sure all the bases are covered so he<br/>
can pursue whatever he wants when he grows up.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
How can you know what he&#39;ll need in the future?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
so, I want to use what he already does into a more &quot;traditional&quot;<br/>
looking transcript/curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not really sure what you&#39;re asking for.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
if asked he is interested zero in math....only wants to study physics<br/>
and quantum physics<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Please don&#39;t divide his world into &quot;subjects.&quot; Everything is connected. <br/>
Physics IS math.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
and doesn&#39;t like to write except iming and emails<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
That IS writing.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing everything he does *as* educational will help your journey.<br/>

I do encourage him to do what he likes and not just go to college for<br/>
the sake of going.  I just worry sometimes that it will hurt him in<br/>
the future for not having done something in his High School years.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=--=<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s done NOTHING? Really?<br/>
<br/>
REALLY???<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I also know that he gets a lot of knowledge from watching the<br/>
different shows thats why I would like to put them together into<br/>
a &quot;class&quot; for his transcript.  We discuss a lot of stuff, however, my<br/>
history knowledge is pretty thin.  I always had trouble in school<br/>
with it and never had an interest.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Fascinating. Someone will NO interest in what has happened in all the <br/>
world---EVER?<br/>
<br/>
History does NOT have to look like school&#39;s version of history. History <br/>
of fashion. History of the horse. History of cooking in different <br/>
lands. Just having an awesome time line is cool.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Can Current Events be a class????<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Dump the idea of &quot;class.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Today&#39;s &quot;current&quot; is tomorrow&#39;s &quot;history.&quot; You&#39;re looking at life <br/>
through school-colored glasses. Take off the glasses.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
He is actually very passionate about the election this year, I am<br/>
wanting to have him volunteer so he can at least do something since<br/>
he can&#39;t vote.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Does HE want to volunteer?<br/>
<br/>
-==-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  We do discuss the issues as well and I explain why<br/>
this is an important year.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>

What makes *this* year more important than any other year?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1816240582">Hi Kim,<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mean to sound harsh, but I agree with Kelly and Pam. This is <br/>
the wrong place to ask for help with directions, subjects or lessons <br/>
plan or college advice. <br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t want you to completely give up yet. I&#39;m thinking on the <br/>
basis that there must have been something about unschooling that <br/>
drawn you to it in the first place. What was it? What makes you <br/>
think unschooling will be good for you and your kid? Pam is right, <br/>
you need to read more becuase your understanding of the basis of <br/>
unschooling is not there. <br/>
<br/>
To unschool will means no expectation of college, no transcript, no <br/>
biology or any other &quot;expected&quot; academic criteria, unless it is <br/>
something the child wants. <br/>
<br/>
To unschool your child would mean no forcing, no co-ercion and no <br/>
expectation. And yes, your writings is coming across to me as co-<br/>
ercion and in-directly &quot;imposing your beliefs&quot; onto your son. I know <br/>
you&#39;re only thinking of the best for him. You do know what is his <br/>
interest. You know what he wants to do and you&#39;re willing to <br/>
faciliate it, which is good. If you want to unschool him, then you <br/>
have to let him get on with his interest. Playing RPG games might <br/>
just play a big part of his future. <br/>
<br/>
In unschooling, the child live his/ her life the way they feel is <br/>
best. And we unschooling parents respect that, and support that. We  <br/>
facilitate and nurture that child&#39;s interest for however long it <br/>
goes. Sometimes it leads to something great but there are times the <br/>
child has put in so much effort and time into such interest, only to <br/>
dump it because it&#39;s not what he wants now. I accept this, for my <br/>
child will know what he&#39;s doing. <br/>
<br/>
The true success of unschooling (to me) will be when we parents is <br/>
able to live with this child-led environment confidently with no <br/>
pain or worries or hang-ups.    <br/>
<br/>
Trust is a big thing. In unschooling, I learn to trust my son&#39;s <br/>
interest and instinct will lead him to a happy life, WITH OR WITHOUT <br/>
college or uni.    <br/>
<br/>
It is hard, learning to unschool for we have to un-learn alot of our <br/>
conventional thinking. Some of us had it easy, some of us had it <br/>
hard but with determination and understanding, and an open mind, we <br/>
have all managed to unschooled somehow. This is how I see it, plain <br/>
and simple. <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re uncomfortable with unschooling, then don&#39;t force yourself. <br/>
The Classical Education (Well Trained Mind) is worth checking out. <br/>
<br/>
But if you&#39;re willing to give unschooling a go, then continue <br/>
reading, join a few more list. I&#39;ve been unschooling for 20 months <br/>
and it&#39;s been lots of reading of blogs, Sandra Dodd&#39;s webpage, 4 <br/>
unschooling list and books.   <br/>
<br/>
We cannot help you identify which show will cover which subject, <br/>
simply because that&#39;s not how it works in unschooling. We do not see <br/>
things in separate individual compartment. Everytime we watch a show <br/>
or do a science experiment, it&#39;s intention is not to learn some <br/>
maths or english or science. It&#39;s intention was to satisfy our <br/>
curiosity of the why&#39;s and the how&#39;s. Any knowledge of maths or <br/>
geography or science that&#39;s attained, is in-evitable a by -product <br/>
of such explorations. Hence, the child&#39;s knowledge can never be in <br/>
the orderly sequence as per the school curriculum. <br/>
<br/>
The above is solely my opinion and I hope it&#39;ll help you make your <br/>
decision better. All the best.<br/>
<br/>
Best Wishes,<br/>
SharonBugs.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1470748401">You might consider that you can bring resources to a child without<br/>
them being curriculum -- and that curriculum, if the child is<br/>
interested in learning the material, may be appropriate.  I emailed<br/>
her off list to suggest some great physics stuff, a cool NOVA special<br/>
from years ago now, etc.  Things we used, not as formal curricular<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-917132618">wow, i didn&#39;t mean to start such a controversial question.<br/>
<br/>
thank you to all of you who gave me positive support and ideas i will <br/>
try to use all of your advise.<br/>
<br/>
as far as those who were a bit negative...well i asked this group <br/>
instead of a traditional group because I have tried to go the <br/>
traditional route when I first started and that isn&#39;t the way my son <br/>
learns so I feel unschooling is a better fit as he has slowly been <br/>
going more to that over the years.<br/>
<br/>
I am in the process of making a transcript for my insurance company <br/>
so i is making me think to the future for him.<br/>
<br/>
I support him in whatever he wants to do. I also don&#39;t mean to come <br/>
across like I push my wants on him cause he pretty much does what he <br/>
wants any way....I just try to find out if there is anything  I can <br/>
offer him.  as far as the question about him wanting to volunteer for <br/>
the campaign, I would never make him go so if he wants to than I will <br/>
take him with me, if not than he doesn&#39;t have to go.  I try to ask <br/>
and make suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
any way, thanks again for your help<br/>
