<div id="ygrps-yiv-1920724366">Hi Sandy,<br/>
<br/>
My 4yo DS loves Boomerang!  His favorite cartoons are Tom & Jerry and <br/>
Pink Panther, although he&#39;s now really loving Dexter&#39;s Laboratory.  I <br/>
think those cartoons are just classics and are entertaining on all <br/>
levels.  We recently got a DVR with our satellite system (supposedly for <br/>
me to record shows) and my ds just loves recording shows, pausing them, <br/>
fast forwarding them, etc.  Even my 16mo is learning how to use the <br/>
remote and pause shows.<br/>

funnier than Fairly Odd Parents.  Bugs Bunny still cracks me up and the kids<br/>
love them, but try finding them!  Remember Saturday mornings when you could<br/>
watch an entire hour of the  Bugs Bunny Road Runner Show?  Yosemite Sam<br/>
being entranced by Bugs Bunny dressed as a Hoochie Koochie girl was pretty<br/>
funny.  Lots of sight gags and slapstick.<br/>
<br/>
I do think that Jimmy Neutron is funny, though.  But it is &quot;intellectual<br/>
comedy&quot; Stuff you have to think about.  I&#39;ll think back on a JN cartoon<br/>
several days later and start giggling because I just got it.  Not because<br/>
I&#39;m that dense but because the joke was that subtle.<br/>
<br/>
Oh and my kids LOVE Monty Python (which you can find on several stations<br/>
now!)<br/>

Neutron but they just don&#39;t laugh...I take that back, Shane makes them<br/>
laugh and so does the banter between Jimmy and Cindy but it not the<br/>
same hardy kind that comes from a Tom and Jerry stint, KWIM?  More of<br/>
a quick chuckle. They don&#39;t seem to mind the difference and both say<br/>
that they like the older ones, its just neat to observe the blatant<br/>
difference in their laughter.<br/>

By the way, Monty Python is often on DirecTV channel 264, BBCAmerica.   Our <br/>
local PBS shows it, too, but usually late on Sat. night.<br/>

<br/>
We got our DVR back in November or December when DirecTV was offering it <br/>
  free with a rebate.  It only works on the TV that it&#39;s connected to. <br/>
We have it connected to our TV in our playroom, not our big TV (we have <br/>
a high-def TV).  We got ours through Circuit City, although you may want <br/>
to check out the DirecTV website to see if they are still offering <br/>
rebates on it.  It&#39;s really great, and much better than a VCR.  The only <br/>
thing I don&#39;t like about it is that the menu is really slow and not <br/>
quite as user-friendly as the regular DirecTV menu.<br/>

Tunes and Tom and Jerry. I think for my 4yr old the<br/>
reason is pretty obvious. He loves the slap-stick<br/>
physical humor. For the same reason my kids have<br/>
enjoyed snippets of Three Stooges that they&#39;ve caught<br/>
on TV.<br/>

only a $6 difference from what we already had!)  This has been a lifesaver<br/>
for our family.  Keon can record all the Power Rangers Mystic Force he wants<br/>
and Mary Elayne can record something she wants that interferes with things<br/>
other people are watching and I can record a full season of Dr. Who and<br/>
watch it when I want to and zap all the (mostly stupid) commercials.  It has<br/>
saved countless arguments and saved my sanity!  The cool thing is that no<br/>
one even seems to argue over what gets recorded and what gets shown live.<br/>
And with our system we can record 2 different shows while we are watching a<br/>
third!<br/>
<br/>
I LOVE my DVR!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1300675227">When my daughter was about five I started buying her boxed sets of old<br/>
comedy shows and she loved to watch them!  She is still (five years later)<br/>
very much into I Love Lucy, Dick Van Dyke, and The Betty White Show.  I do<br/>
not have to wonder what the content is like or counteract the negative<br/>
behaviors that she was acting out from endless hours of newer tv shows with<br/>
the bratty attituded kids.  She is much nicer to be around now except for<br/>
when her hormones get kind of whacky.<br/>

any other cartoon or tv show.  I think there is a lot to be said about the<br/>

<br/>
 Interesting.  Both Tom and Jerry and Pink Panther are visual<br/>
humor/slapstick.  There&#39;s almost no dialogue in either.  Fairly odd parents<br/>
and Jimmy neutron rely on jokes and puns and allusions for their humor.  My<br/>
kids like both kinds but their more likely to loudly laugh at the slapstick.<br/>
I can remember my son falling over laughing at slapstick when he was 5.  The<br/>
verbal humor takes a sec to register and then the laughs are quieter.  Still<br/>
good though. <br/>
<br/>
FWIW, I just asked my 10yo daughter (sitting next to me) and she says the<br/>
funniest shows are  That&#39;s so Raven and Roseanne, both verbal and that the<br/>
Simpsons makes her laugh the most.  (an expert mix) .  <br/>
<br/>

Maybe it&#39;s just the ones on Nick and Disney that don&#39;t seem so funny and<br/>
it&#39;s not so much of a yesterday/today type of issue so much as a network<br/>

I do not know why, but we just like to talk about it. :-) They also laugh<br/>
harder at older family comedies like The Cosby Show and Sister, Sister than<br/>
they do at The Suite Life of Zach and Cody, That&#39;s So Raven, etc. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2004786308">Wow, such an array of likes and dislikes in this area!  My kids watch<br/>
Thats So Raven, Jimmy Neutron and those each day; they really like<br/>
those shows they just don&#39;t laugh hardly at all.  It does appear that<br/>
the slapstick wins for best humor though :-)  Recently, they have<br/>
started watching the Simpson&#39;s, what is that?  Like 16 years old now?<br/>
 I had never watched it before.<br/>
<br/>
I had totally forgotten about I Love Lucy and some of those older<br/>
shows that were so good and funny.  My kids LOVE Seinfeld, Kramer<br/>
being their favorite character, they&#39;d probably enjoy Lucy and the<br/>
gang too.  They&#39;re big fans of the Cosby Show also, nice hearty<br/>
laughter, the kind that makes you laugh too despite what mood your in.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all for your input, it&#39;s been fun.  <br/>

statement bugs me.  Maybe you&#39;d like that the menu only shows <br/>
the &quot;kids programs&quot; so that your children don&#39;t have to scroll <br/>
through so much on the menu screen.   Maybe your kids aren&#39;t reading <br/>
yet, and they can&#39;t use the menu function to find their favorite <br/>
channels.     <br/>
<br/>
But I think we need to be aware of things that we say that sound <br/>
like &quot;ageism.&quot;   Because I think kids can be trusted to figure out <br/>
what they like and don&#39;t like.  I have met kids that love adult <br/>
horror, but my kids make sure to let you know they don&#39;t enjoy <br/>
that.  My kids don&#39;t want to watch the soft porn that is now <br/>
acceptable on network TV!  They have learned how to avoid even <br/>
accidently being exposed to that.  So instead of saying &quot;kids <br/>
programs&quot;  maybe it can be &quot;my kids favorite programs.&quot;  &#39;Cause <br/>
chances are, they would be my favorite channels and programs, too!  <br/>

<br/>
Good point.<br/>
I had a discussion with a co-worker about this yesterday. She doesns&#39;t<br/>
censor her child&#39;s viewing either, but works with his comfort level.<br/>
We were talking about how every person is SO differernt and how<br/>
important it is to give them that freedom to choose their own balance.<br/>
<br/>
We had some movie&#39;s here a couple nights ago. Two of the boys are<br/>
REALLY into horror. I mean intense horror, with good storylines. The<br/>
kind of stuff that would give most kid nightmares.<br/>
They wanted to rent &quot;Ju-On&quot; which is the original Japanese version of<br/>
&quot;The Grudge&quot; but it was out. I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s 10x scarier than &quot;The<br/>
Grudge&quot;. They ended up with &quot;The Ring 2&quot; (dubbed hilarious and not<br/>
scary at all by these two) and &quot;Boo&quot;.  They don&#39;t even jump at the<br/>
scary parts....cripes.:)<br/>
<br/>
Some of the younger ones were interested, but were warned about what<br/>
they might see. A couple of them went in for a few minutes and decided<br/>
it wasn&#39;t for them. No big deal.<br/>
<br/>
I love that each of them knows themselves. I love that when they want<br/>
to test the boundaries of what they&#39;re comfortable with, they know I&#39;m<br/>
here for them. It&#39;s a joyful process when we&#39;re all in it together.<br/>
<br/>
Sierra was a bit leary of &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;, thinking it might be<br/>
too scary. We agreed to turn it off if it got too intense. She ended<br/>
up LOVING it. So through the process, they get to grow and learn and<br/>
find out new things about their own balance, recreating it as humans<br/>
do from year to year.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1591282585">&quot;I&#39;ve been told they will also have a<br/>
way to send content from one t.v. to another if you have more than one Tivo.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You can already do that with wireless connections.  All of ours are linked and named and we can download programs from one tivo to another to watch where we want instead of just where we Tivoed them..<br/>
<br/>
I just got an email this week, or maybe last??, about the new KidZone.  Looks great, can&#39;t wait!<br/>

We own a Tivo and it has been invaluable to us.  The new Tivo systems are<br/>
coming out with some really good child things, like a way to have a menu<br/>
that displays only the kids programs.  I&#39;ve been told they will also have a<br/>
way to send content from one t.v. to another if you have more than one Tivo.<br/>

We have seasons passes to Sesame Street, Dora, Rescue Pets, and Blues Clues<br/>
and since these occur daily they are always at the top of our list which<br/>
drives me crazy.  So for it&#39;s more of I&#39;m to lazy to scroll through her<br/>
