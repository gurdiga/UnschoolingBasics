<div id="ygrps-yiv-2080845545">You can google Sandra Dodd&#39;s website--she has several but look for the one with a long list on the left margin of worrisome topics, and you&#39;ll find related articles. Also you may find something on the website UnschoolingAmerica.com by Dayna Martin. There is probably more but this is where I&#39;d start. And of course--decide for yourself! Cameron  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2071774881">I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s anything specific on handheld games in the following<br/>
links.  I think they might be included under the &quot;video games&quot; umbrella.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of good stuff at Sandra Dodd&#39;s site from real life unschoolers and<br/>
elsewhere:<br/>

Steven Johnson&#39;s book &quot;Everything Bad is Good for You&quot; is mentioned on her<br/>
site.  You could get that from the library.<br/>
<br/>
Joyce has some articles under the Video Games heading:<br/>

Marc Prensky&#39;s site may have something you can print out:<br/>

Personally, positives for my daughter include (but probably aren&#39;t limited<br/>
to): using her Nintendo DS as a way to connect with like-minded kids (like I<br/>
do with people who like to read books); finding other kids who share her<br/>
passion for quests (Pokemon Blue Rescue Team), finding other kids who share<br/>
her love of animals (Nintendogs, Hamsterz, Catz, Dogz, Horsez), challenging<br/>
herself with games that are harder than others (Spyro), having the<br/>
opportunity to share game characters when she can wirelessly connect with<br/>
other players; learning to read more fluently in order to advance in the<br/>
game; having something to do when we might be doing something boring in her<br/>
opinion; having a place to retreat to when she feels overwhelmed; happily<br/>
being able to share her quest results, dog competition results and other<br/>
joyful moments of accomplishment with us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2780185">THANKS for all of your ideas!  They were very helpful!  Here&#39;s an<br/>
update on how the meeting went:<br/>
<br/>
As for our meeting last night, it was a very heated discussion (which<br/>
is rare for us - lol).  There were two main complaints against video<br/>
games: 1) they are bad for children and 2) they reduce socialization,<br/>
which is why the group gets together.  Two parents (out of about 12)<br/>
were strongly against video games and felt that they should be banned.<br/>
 Four parents, including myself, felt that video games have a bad<br/>
reputation which is not completely valid.  I brought up the point,<br/>
that I have seen on the boards several times, asking if we would be<br/>
upset if a child came and read a book the whole time at our get<br/>
together (which has been known to happen).  Several others felt that<br/>
although they didn&#39;t &quot;like&quot; video games, that by banning them or<br/>
making any rules about them that they were passing judgement and that<br/>
it was up to each parent to decide what was best for their children. <br/>
Fortunately, majority ruled and the decision was made to not ban them<br/>
based on the principle of it being a parent&#39;s personal choice. <br/>
<br/>
As I&#39;ve said before, I would love to find a local group with the<br/>
parenting beliefs of you and so many others on this board, so I don&#39;t<br/>
have to deal with these issues (and sometimes my own guilt and<br/>
revisiting these old tapes in my head).  But overall, for now, we<br/>
still have a wonderful time with this group.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>
<br/>
