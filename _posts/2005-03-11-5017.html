<div id="ygrps-yiv-736316196">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;some children demand structure.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
People post this idea quite a lot. I have mentioned it myself.<br/>
<br/>
But what the heck does it look like? Seriously, how does a child &quot;demand<br/>
structure&quot;? Or how do you know if they are doing so? <br/>
<br/>
Touching on Ren&#39;s (I think) reply, how can the parent be sure that the<br/>
demand, whatever it looks like, is not just a child resisting healing from<br/>
school damage and the self-deprecation that school can cause?<br/>
<br/>
What might &quot;demanding structure&quot; look like for a child who had never been to<br/>
school? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering, really I am, I&#39;m not being facetious or tricky, because I<br/>
have absolutely zero personal experience of a child demanding structure, or<br/>
any kind of timetable assistance from me. <br/>

administer tests.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My son is one of those that &quot;demands structure.&quot;  By that I mean he <br/>
needs to have his day laid out for him.  He doesn&#39;t want me <br/>
to &quot;structure&quot; his day, but he wants to know what his day is going <br/>
to entail.  What are we doing?  Where are we going?  Keon falls into <br/>
that broad spectrum of autistic (very high functioning - auspergers <br/>
end more than autistic end if you understand the spectrum)  Anyway, <br/>
he does much better if he knows how the day is going to work out.  <br/>
He isn&#39;t very easy to disengage from what he expects to do and he <br/>
isn&#39;t always keen to spontenaiety.  Rarely can I say, &quot;Hey, let&#39;s go <br/>
do this!&quot;  Now if it is going to see Jalen at Ren&#39;s house he is all <br/>
for it LOL! and most of the time I can suggest the park as an <br/>
alternative to what is already in our day, but not always.  And <br/>
doing things out of order isn&#39;t a good idea either.  For instance if <br/>
I say we need to go to Foodworld and Target and I go to Target first <br/>
it doesn&#39;t always go well.  Even explaining why we can&#39;t go buy ice <br/>
cream and leave it in the car while we go into Target because it <br/>
will melt just &quot;doesn&#39;t compute.&quot;  I *said* we were going to <br/>
Foodworld and Target not Target and Foodworld (and I better not stop <br/>
at Pier One between!)  So I have to be careful how I phrase things, <br/>
so that I don&#39;t get myself in trouble!<br/>
<br/>
Now when we pulled our girls out of school, they each had to work <br/>
through the &quot;what are we going to do today&quot; thing.  They each <br/>
expected me to plan out their days, but the longer that we are free <br/>
from schedules the less they have asked for &quot;structure.&quot;  I still <br/>
get asked, &quot;Are we going to do anything today?&quot; but it is more <br/>
of &quot;do we have anything planned that I need to get dressed for?&quot;  <br/>
LOL!!<br/>

This was just being discussed over at the SHINE list and this was <br/>
pretty common.  Not the &quot;structure&quot; part, but rather just giving our <br/>
children the info that they needed (the daily &quot;plan&quot; [if any] along <br/>
with who, where, when, what, how, why, etc.).  Many of the posters were <br/>
surprised to consider that ALL children didn&#39;t want/need that info.  :)<br/>

I am glad that you clarified what you mean by demanding structure.  How you<br/>
meant it wasn&#39;t at all what I was thinking. <br/>
