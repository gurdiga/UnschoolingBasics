<div id="ygrps-yiv-871671956">I just wanted to say, &#39;Thank you!&quot; to all the ladies out there who responded <br/>
to my query about being single and unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I heard from an incredibly large number of you. I am so impressed with how <br/>
much you shared and opened up.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t believe the great strength and wisdom so many of you shared on how <br/>
you handled your experiences. I am really humbled by it all.<br/>
<br/>
I wish you all the happiness in the world.<br/>
<br/>
Much love,<br/>
Wildflower<br/>
