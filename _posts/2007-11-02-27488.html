Thank you for the link I am going to check it out, but the words to the song.....LOL.....i had to laugh, I am going to show hubby too.<br/>
and on the &quot;weirdness&quot;, I can see how that can be seen as weird, but I think its awesome, wonderful, and I hope my kids turn out &quot;weird&quot;.......LOL.......I want them to think outside the box, I want them to have the self esteem to do what they want, not what the crowd wants or thinks they should do. And I think they are well on their way. I hope.<br/>
But yeah, I get that he doesn&#39;t want us to &quot;screw them up&quot;. I respect that, and it&#39;s a valid concern. But I think as time goes on he will see more and more, and he has seen a lot , and he knows they are doing great.<br/>
But that fear just creeps up every now and again!<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
Diane<br/>
