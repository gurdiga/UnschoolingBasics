<div id="ygrps-yiv-829270746">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I just joined on the recommendation of a friend who described your list as<br/>
&quot;everything you need to know&quot;.  That&#39;s great for me because I know<br/>
unschooling is the best for my family but I&#39;m having some difficulty getting<br/>
the &quot;how to&quot; part down.<br/>
<br/>
Talk to me more about controlling the TV time, please!<br/>
<br/>
I have an 8 year old son, who is profoundly gifted and a daughter who is 6<br/>
and very creative, exhibits characteristics of gifted, and a 14 month old<br/>
dangerously curious daughter.  We have homeschooled from the beginning<br/>
except for a short period in a religious part-time preschool environment in<br/>
order for them to master Arabic.<br/>
<br/>
Salam,<br/>
Natalie<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-501693026">Well, I have benefitted by just mumbling to my husband about it instead of<br/>
freaking out on the kids.  We recently upgraded our cable service to include<br/>
Discovery Channel 1 and 2 and the Animal Planet, but of course with that<br/>
package comes Disney, Cartoon Network, and a whole slew of other pure<br/>
entertainment channels.  I get out of whack when I see that my son spends<br/>
huge amounts of time on pure entertainment options.<br/>
<br/>
But, of course, as life goes in cycles, today he got out the school game I<br/>
had created a long time ago (color coded cards of assignments for each<br/>
subject with options for assignments to advance 1-5 spaces)  then you get a<br/>
bonus every so often and they can do things that I hate to do (painting,<br/>
clay, anything that usually makes a mess for me to clean up).  Anyway, he<br/>
got it all out, threw it together, did 5 questions of the &quot;challenge cards&quot;<br/>
and announced that for his bonus he&#39;d like to paint.  And, I let them even<br/>
though it was already 9 PM with the condition that they clean it up so that<br/>
I would not be able to tell what had gone on.  They met that requirement.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, he does get around to leaps and bounds in learning, all in<br/>
his own time.  I just have to be patient and remember that he is my twin.  I<br/>
hate that realization but am grateful for the clarity of understanding on<br/>
which to base my judgement - when I stop to think that is.<br/>
<br/>
But, back to the value of setting limits, I do not allow my kids to watch<br/>
shows that have mature themes, such as teen boyfriends and girlfriends, nor<br/>
violence nor shows that I find display outright disrespect (as well as a few<br/>
other things related to our religious beliefs).  Usually they honor my<br/>
wishes but they lost the Disney Channel because they continually challenged<br/>
me with their offerings.<br/>
<br/>
Do you recommend any limitations on hours of tv time or setting up a system<br/>
of earning that time.  I&#39;ve thought about it but honestly I don&#39;t have<br/>
enough energy to micromanage.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; huge amounts of time on pure entertainment options.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is there anything wrong with pure entertainment?  Can you truly get<br/>
*nothing* from &quot;pure entertainment&quot;?  I&#39;ve watched shows and movies that one<br/>
could classify as &quot;pure entertainment&quot; and gotten quite a bit from them.<br/>
Interpersonal communication, new thoughts on old ideas, something that<br/>
sparks my interest and has me running to google to learn more, or even<br/>
things that challenge my philosophical and spiritual side.  My kids enjoy<br/>
anime, live action shows on Disney channel and Law & Order and CSI reruns.<br/>
All &quot;pure entertainment.&quot;  We have had some wonderful discussions about<br/>
racism, crime, themes from historic references, art styles, music styles,<br/>
and I can&#39;t count the number of times they have looked into some<br/>
investigation technique shown on tv to try to disprove it.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, he does get around to leaps and bounds in learning, all in<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; his own time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He&#39;s learning all the time!  Try to stop him.  It may not be what society<br/>
has deemed as &quot;academic&quot; but he IS learning.<br/>
<br/>
But, back to the value of setting limits, I do not allow my kids to watch<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; shows that have mature themes, such as teen boyfriends and girlfriends,<br/>
&gt; nor<br/>
&gt; violence nor shows that I find display outright disrespect (as well as a<br/>
&gt; few<br/>
&gt; other things related to our religious beliefs).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why not?  Understanding relationships is a very important thing.  Watch<br/>
these shows with them if you have issues so that you can field any questions<br/>
or clarify where your family stands on these issues.  Emily, my oldest is a<br/>
big fan of Degrassi.  It has touched on some very mature themes over the<br/>
past few years (ok, since its inception with Degrassi Jr. High)  My daughter<br/>
was very upset because in the US they didn&#39;t show one episode where a girl<br/>
had an abortion.  There were other storylines in that episode other than<br/>
just Manny&#39;s abortion.  We found the script online and talked about it.  We<br/>
talked about abortion and where we stand on it and what our beliefs feel<br/>
about it and how the government views it and also why it was censored.<br/>
Another thing to consider is whether or not your children *want* to watch<br/>
shows with mature themes.  Mary Elayne is 10 and still doesn&#39;t care to watch<br/>
shows that have kissing in them (not to mention sexual scenes).  Even<br/>
animated kissing is not in her book for things she wants to watch.<br/>
Sometimes those things that we limit are things our children would naturally<br/>
not want to watch anyway and if they DO want to watch it, then we need to<br/>
know why and watch it with them if you feel it is something that is<br/>
questionable.  There are some very healthy teen relationships being<br/>
portrayed on tv.  Don&#39;t dismiss them just because they are portraying<br/>
something you aren&#39;t ready to deal with because your children may be.<br/>
<br/>
 Usually they honor my<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; wishes but they lost the Disney Channel because they continually<br/>
&gt; challenged<br/>
&gt; me with their offerings.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which is why you need to figure out what it is that draws them to<br/>
&quot;forbidden&quot; shows.  Your children seem ready to move forward and you are<br/>
fighting them to stay behind.<br/>
<br/>
Do you recommend any limitations on hours of tv time or setting up a system<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; of earning that time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No.  Not limits on television.  In fact we have 3 televisions *and* a DVR<br/>
(which can record 2 shows at once while watching a third - you missed the<br/>
whole discussion of how much I LOVE my DVR LOL!)  2 of the tvs are in my<br/>
kids&#39; rooms even - something I couldn&#39;t have fathomed just 5 years ago.  Do<br/>
YOU have to earn television time?  Can YOU watch whatever YOU want?  Are you<br/>
setting controls for your children that you yourself don&#39;t follow?  Are you<br/>
making tv an obstacle to joyful learning?  I would suggest that you read<br/>

Twenty years from now would you rather have kids who have neat houses  <br/>

<br/>
Kids will be as tidy or chaotic as they end up being as adults. We  <br/>
can create an environment where they experience (relative) tidiness  <br/>
so they know the benefits (and downside of the time it takes). But if  <br/>
tie their experience with tidy to their ability to be creative<br/>
we&#39;re stealing something hugely beneficial from them -- the freedom  <br/>
to let their creativity flow -- for something temporary (tidiness).<br/>
<br/>
If the goal is to have a neat house, then having kids is not a great  <br/>
idea! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
To help kids unfold we need to keep our own issues out of the way of  <br/>
their exploration.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots and lots of words written about chores and kids helping:<br/>

you&#39;re calling attention to it with big red flags! You&#39;re saying  <br/>
&quot;This is something you can&#39;t handle.&quot; For many children -- many  <br/>
*people* -- a barrier that says &quot;you aren&#39;t capable of handling this&quot;  <br/>
creates an internal challenge of &quot;Yes, I can!&quot; It might not even be  <br/>
something they *want* to do! But a barrier makes them want to test  <br/>
themselves against it.<br/>
<br/>
Use opportunties to talk about things! Try *not* to make them  <br/>
opportunities to pour your beliefs into them. Use it as an  <br/>
opportunity to share *why* you believe as you do but give them the  <br/>
freedom to think things over and weigh them from various points of  <br/>
view. If your values are good, they&#39;ll come to the same  <br/>
conclusions! :-) (The process is more complex than that, but ask! We  <br/>
*all* have values we dearly would love to pass onto our children. But  <br/>
recognizing the more pressure we put on kids to beleive as we do, the  <br/>
more they&#39;re likely to pull away from the values because they&#39;re  <br/>
trying to pull away from the pressure.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-461334891">Great response, Michelle!  Natalie, Michelle has told you pretty much what was told to me when I first joined this group because TV was big issue for me, too.  However, I decided to just experiment with the info that was given to me and see what happened.  We had just gotten expanded cable when we joined so many of the stations were like a huge candy store for my son.  He watched and watched and watched.  I told him the one channel that I did not want him to watch unsupervised was Cartoon Network.  He is only 5 and I have seen some disturbing (in my opinion) cartoons on that Channel.  My guy totally rejected our tried and true PBS and went full speed ahead into Disney.  Then he found Nick and it was back and forth all day.  This lasted for months.  I said nothing although I was going crazy some days.  Then one day none of it seemed to be a big deal except for Cartoon Network.  I realized that during the day Cartoon Network did not show the more &quot;adult&quot; programming so I told him to have at it.  My man watched and watched and watched Cartoon Network.  Now, it gets boring to him sometimes.  Because there are no limits, he can take it or leave it.  And what I have actually found is that he has learned the line ups and it fascinates me.  He will let me know that it is Monday so there is a Disney Channel movie or he will have me record a particular show at a certain time and he will let me know the shows name and time.  I have even showed him how to record the cartoons while editing out the commercials.  It has all become really fascinating and......VERY PEACEFUL!  Many days he will come to me and say, &quot;let&#39;s do an activity.&quot; When I was limiting TV and insisting that we do a special activity, my little guy was not happy and would not participate.<br/>
<br/>
I say all of this to encourage you to just consider that maybe what is offered here is an option that can really work for you and yours.  I don&#39;t mind my son at age 5 seeing teen kissing on Disney Channel.  I think it is normal and natural and I feel that it takes away the mysticism which could make him more curious than is necessary.<br/>
<br/>
My 2 cents!  Wishing you and yours much success!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1789050667">How do you define &quot;pure entertainment&quot;?  According to whom?  My husband<br/>
loves the history channel....to him it is entertainment. To him, it&#39;s fun<br/>
and entertaining. He doesn&#39;t watch it because he wants to learn anything, he<br/>
watches it because he enjoys it.I can take it or leave it. I don&#39;t &#39;learn&#39;<br/>
as much as he does from them because I don&#39;t particularly like the format.<br/>
Occasionally something is on I find enjoyable, but not usually.  I love to<br/>
watch sci fi. Pure entertainment......and yet, I find it fascinating how sci<br/>
fi shows (past and present) take current issues and politics, place them in<br/>
a future or off-world setting and go with it. Watch old Star Trek episodes<br/>
and you can &#39;learn&#39; a lot about the social issue of the 60s and the 70s. My<br/>
boys and I have had great discussions about race relations from some Star<br/>
Trek Deep Space Nine episodes) That&#39;s not why I watch them, but I enjoy that<br/>
about them. Old movies and tv shows can do the same thing.  My 10 year old<br/>
had a blast a few weeks ago watching a pbs show, Texas Ranch House. He loved<br/>
it! He thought of it as pure entertainment. We all discovered a lot about<br/>
cowboys we never knew and talked a lot about the dynamics between men and<br/>
women, blacks and whites, rich and poor.  It doesn&#39;t occur to him to<br/>
differentiate pbs from the cartoon channels. He watches what strikes his<br/>
interest. We have no rules or regulations about tv. They watch cartoons,<br/>
anime, tech channels, pbs, sci fi, discovery, cooking, tlc, we all love the<br/>
csi, law and order and those kind of shows, and who knows what else. Choices<br/>
are made based on what is interesting and, yes, entertaining to whoever is<br/>
choosing. And yet, the kids don&#39;t watch all that much tv. I watch more than<br/>
anyone else in the house. I like it for &#39;background noise&#39;. I have my<br/>
kitchen tv on most of the day (well, when we&#39;re actually home).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1268998424">***I get out of whack when I see that my son spends<br/>
huge amounts of time on pure entertainment options.***<br/>
<br/>
Not sure what &quot;pure&quot; entertainment is but I&#39;m all for it! : )   I&#39;ve<br/>
never been so entertained that my mind switched off - is that what you<br/>
meant? <br/>
I&#39;ve been so entertained by so many things in my life and I&#39;ve made<br/>
deliberate choices to make sure my son has been entertained over the<br/>
years.  He just turned fourteen and if I could somehow ensure that he was<br/>
always entertained I&#39;d do it in a heartbeat!&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We went to a Cinco de Mayo party of the fifth of May (Ha!  Who&#39;d have<br/>
guessed?&lt;snort&gt;) and it was wildly entertaining.   We had a cookout on<br/>
Mother&#39;s day and invited family and friends and it was all about<br/>
entertainment (with lots of food.)<br/>
<br/>
I own a much used and beloved copy of The Princess Bride just so I can be<br/>
delightfully entertained anytime I want.  <br/>
<br/>
But what about entertainment might get a person &quot;out of whack? &quot;   Is fun<br/>
for the sake of fun a sin?   I think our early Puritan settlers are<br/>
sending their uptight vibes to us even today.  &lt;g&gt;  That seems like<br/>
witchcraft to me... <br/>
<br/>
We recently played Buzzword and had so much fun.  With a big group of<br/>
people you have folks yelling out answers when it&#39;s not even their turn. <br/>
I laughed so hard my stomach still hurts.    But, I learned stuff, so was<br/>
it &quot;pure&quot; entertainment or was it something else?     And I learned from<br/>
watching The Princess Bride.  My niece even took a trip to the cliffs of<br/>
Moher when she realized they were a real place.  She learned a lot on<br/>
that trip.  <br/>
<br/>
My son has learned so much from watching &quot;pure entertainment.&quot;   He is<br/>
very interested in movie making and when he watches a movie he&#39;s paying<br/>
attention to the lighting, the camera angles, the direction, the dialog,<br/>
the set design, the costuming, the musical score...  <br/>
He&#39;s learned about comedic timing, line delivery, melodrama, puns,<br/>
sarcasm (maybe he learned a little about that from his family, too)<br/>
foreshadowing, suspense building.   He&#39;s learned about movie budgets.  <br/>
He&#39;s learned and learning about screen writing.  He&#39;s learned about the<br/>
struggles of film makers to get their movies made.  <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s seen every Stanley Kubrick film and every film we could find by<br/>
other directors he likes.  (  He can tell you about camera shots in any<br/>
scene you can name in hundreds of movies.  Hundreds.  He&#39;s been working<br/>
for two years on his own claymation film.  He and his cousins are talking<br/>
about making a B movie spoof this summer in the spirit of &quot;The Lost<br/>
Skeleton of Cadavra.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t even begin to list everything he&#39;s learned from &quot;entertainment.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We recently got the film &quot;Eraserhead&quot; on interlibrary loan.   He learned<br/>
about &quot;Eraserhead&quot; from a documentary on  midnight movies.  He&#39;s been<br/>
systematically watching those old films when he can find them.  Some have<br/>
been easy to find, like &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show.&quot;  (his mom owns a<br/>
copy&lt;g&gt;)  Some are difficult, like &quot;Pink Flamingos.&quot; (weird film!)  He&#39;s<br/>
watched &quot;Eraserhead&quot; twice (so far) and he looked it up on-line and read<br/>
reviews and read ideas other people have about what the film means.  <br/>
He&#39;s found interviews with David Lynch about the film.   He learned that<br/>
some bands took their names and others took inspiration for lyrics from<br/>
that film.  And he learned maybe the funniest thing of all about this<br/>
film he watched for &quot;entertainment&quot;... It&#39;s been added to the national<br/>
film registry after it was selected as &quot;culturally significant&quot; by the<br/>
Library of Congress.    <br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers: On the cutting edge of cultural education.  &lt;BEG&gt;  (well,<br/>
I&#39;m amused though I doubt E.d. Hirsch would be...)<br/>
<br/>
Of course, other David Lynch films are now on order through interlibrary<br/>
loan and the Twin Peaks TV series is on it&#39;s way from Amazon. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Dylan&#39;s already seen Blue Velvet.  And he&#39;s made countless connections<br/>
from that film and the actors to other films.  <br/>
<br/>

If it is possible for something to be &quot;pure entertainment&quot;  I think<br/>
that&#39;s wonderful.  I think being entertained is very important.  I think<br/>
joy will get us over the bumps of life like nothing else.  But I think<br/>
there is no moment when humans aren&#39;t learning.   If we&#39;re breathing,<br/>
we&#39;re gathering information we will use in the next moments or in the<br/>
next days or weeks or months or years.  It all matters.  <br/>

&gt; Twenty years from now would you rather have kids who have neat houses<br/>
&gt; and an internal voice that says to their creative urges &quot;No, too much<br/>
&gt; trouble to even try,&quot; or kids who are exuberantly creative but untidy?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Kids will be as tidy or chaotic as they end up being as adults. We<br/>
&gt; can create an environment where they experience (relative) tidiness<br/>
&gt; so they know the benefits (and downside of the time it takes). But if<br/>
&gt; tie their experience with tidy to their ability to be creative<br/>
&gt; we&#39;re stealing something hugely beneficial from them -- the freedom<br/>
&gt; to let their creativity flow -- for something temporary (tidiness).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If the goal is to have a neat house, then having kids is not a great<br/>
&gt; idea! ;-) </span></blockquote></div>

This reminds me of a happening the other day...I have been <br/>
watching &quot;Gilligan&#39;s Island&quot; a lot, we bought the series and have <br/>
watched it through SO many times.  The Skipper mentions being at <br/>
Guadalcanal (sp?)...I don&#39;t remember hearing about it before, but when <br/>
I saw it again I remembered.  I was helping my little brother with his <br/>
homework and there it was!  I read about it...a dreadfully long <br/>
battle, I&#39;m thinking 8 months or something like...no wonder the <br/>
Skipper remembered it so well!  I had the Skipper&#39;s experiences to <br/>
connect the knowledge in his book to...unfortunately, he didn&#39;t and <br/>
failed the test.  I was watching the shows for &quot;pure entertainment&quot;, <br/>
but they helped me make a connection later...sometimes it&#39;s not what <br/>
you are doing &quot;right now&quot; that matters, it&#39;s how it connects later.  <br/>

<br/>
It sounds like you place a lot of importance on playing school like this. It might help to try to focus on seeing the learning that happens outside of schoolish subjects.<br/>
