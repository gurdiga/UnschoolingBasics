<div id="ygrps-yiv-472185167">My name is Kelly.  I&#39;m a 41yo disabled mom with two children at home <br/>
(ages 11 & 15).  I&#39;m also going to be a grandmother in Oct this year, <br/>
thanks to my oldest chid (age 21) - I&#39;m so excited!<br/>
<br/>
Daniel, 15, is in his 3rd year hsing.  Rachel, 11, is in her 1st.  <br/>
Both were removed from public schools for social reasons: my son, for <br/>
safety reasons, and my daughter because she was turning into someone <br/>
the likes of which my family has never seen (think cruel, Queen of <br/>
the World).<br/>
<br/>
Despite being somewhat dissatisfied with it, I did a mostly <br/>
traditional form of hsing until February this year.  I&#39;d read and <br/>
dismissed unschooling more times than I can count, and then one day <br/>
it clicked - that&#39;s what my kids needed, that&#39;s what I needed.  I <br/>
figured deschooling was the first order of business.<br/>
<br/>
What is the difference between deschooling and unschooling?  I&#39;ve <br/>
been pretty much standing back just watching to see where each of <br/>
them are in learning to learn.  Rachel, 11, is always going to <br/>
obviously be learning because she&#39;s so darned curious and <br/>
demonstrative about what&#39;s going on inside her head.  Daniel is not <br/>
as open with what is going on inside him, but I can see him gaining <br/>
more confidence as he helps his dad build our new deck.<br/>
<br/>
I become involved when they want me too: Daniel orally relives <br/>
everything he encounters, he likes to access wrestling stuff on the <br/>
Internet and at the library; Rachel asks to use Print Shop 22 to <br/>
create things all the time, and wants to know how to spell certain <br/>
words.  Those are just examples, not the whole story, you understand.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m not directing their learning, but I am available and willing <br/>
for whatever they want from me to assist their learning.  So how is <br/>
that different from unschooling? Or if that&#39;s unschooling, how is it <br/>
different from deschooling?  I&#39;m beginning to think there really is <br/>
no substantial difference.<br/>
<br/>
How do you see it?</div>

 </span></blockquote>Deschooling is a transitional process. Its a time of healing and <br/>
decompressing and letting go of &quot;school&quot; so that unschooling can <br/>
happen. Its not so much separate from unschooling as a first stage. <br/>
Parents need to deschool as much as kids, and sometimes take longer -<br/>
 after all, we&#39;ve had more time to get &quot;set in our ways&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
The Three Stages of Unschooling<br/>
<br/>
Kelly Lovejoy, 2004<br/>
<br/>
My son Cameron (16) and I recently started sitting in on a college <br/>
Sociology class. He asked for and received electric guitar lessons for <br/>
his birthday. Mondays he goes to a nearby school and takes African <br/>
drumming lessons. He&#39;s taking a weekly film class starting in March, <br/>
and we&#39;ll be sending him to a weeklong film school in Maine in May. <br/>
Duncan (almost 8) just started karate lessons. Ben (my husband) has <br/>
just finished a class (with tests and all) that&#39;s required before he <br/>
can put on Lt Col (Air National Guard) and is now in NJ for three weeks <br/>
of &quot;rah-rah&quot; and classroom training and tests for the two new drugs he <br/>
will be selling. I&#39;m going to a one-day intensive &quot;Bee School&quot; to learn <br/>
to take care of my Christmas present: two beehives.<br/>
<br/>
Cameron said the other day, &quot;For Unschoolers, we sure are taking a lot <br/>
of schooly classes!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That got me thinking...especially since we are one of those families <br/>
that discovered unschooling after years and years of schooling.<br/>
<br/>
I think that there are three &quot;Stages of Unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Stage I<br/>
<br/>
The first stage is the longest and most difficult and involves getting <br/>
rid of all school-think, which includes classes and &quot;instruction&quot; and <br/>
school-speak. We have to rid ourselves of the reliance on schools and <br/>
teachers and testing and book-worship. We need to look deeply into the <br/>
difference between &#39;teach&#39; and &#39;learn&#39;. We ban classes and structure <br/>
and nagging. It&#39;s accepting that grades and requirements and diplomas <br/>
and curricula and extrinsic motivations truly have no meaning in an <br/>
unschooling life. It&#39;s realizing that the whole world is related and <br/>
inter-related: it&#39;s about NOT dividing the world into subjects: math is <br/>
science is art is history is literature is FUN! It&#39;s a time for <br/>
reflection on how we&#39;ve learned the things that really matter in our <br/>
adult lives. It&#39;s hard to let go of all that school-think, to go beyond <br/>
what we&#39;ve been *taught* was important and to value ALL learning as <br/>
important.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s realizing that we learn what WE believe is important WHEN we are <br/>
ready. And it&#39;s realizing that what&#39;s important often changes. It&#39;s <br/>
about abolishing coercion in learning and about the freedom to change <br/>
passions. It&#39;s understanding that learning doesn&#39;t stop.<br/>
<br/>
Face it, almost all of you reading this in 2004 went to school---at <br/>
least for 12 years, maybe as many as 22 or 25 years! School is so <br/>
ingrained in us, that it&#39;s hard to think any other way. We appreciate <br/>
&quot;straight A students&quot; and &quot;AP&quot; classes and college prep high schools <br/>
and term papers and &quot;higher math&quot; and high SAT/ACT scores. &quot;Good&quot; <br/>
students are given preferential treatment by everyone: pizzas for <br/>
reading and Chuck E. Cheese tokens for good report cards. Even our <br/>
child&#39;s car insurance is lowered if we have an &quot;A student!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Stage one is about ridding our minds of those things, about really <br/>
thinking about learning in a holistic manner. It&#39;s about examining how <br/>
we learned what truly interests us---especially those things that <br/>
didn&#39;t require a &quot;teacher.&quot; What are your passions? HOW did you learn <br/>
to do those things? In a classroom?<br/>
<br/>
Two of my passions as a child were dogs and horses. Dogs and horses are <br/>
NOT taught in any grade, middle, or high school *I* know of. But I <br/>
wanted to learn everything I could about them. My parents gave me dogs <br/>
and horses. They bought me books and paid for me to take riding lessons <br/>
and dog obedience classes. They paid for dog and horse shows and <br/>
equipment. My passion threw me into reading every book I could find <br/>
(there were no videos back then—or &quot;Animal Planet!&quot;). By twelve I could <br/>
identify every breed of dog and horse that I had ever seen or read <br/>
about and tell you how it was developed, where, why, and by whom. I <br/>
spent every weekend and every afternoon at a dog show/horse <br/>
show/event/trial or just hanging around the stable or kennel. I asked <br/>
thousands of questions and &quot;got my hands dirty.&quot; Many of my friends <br/>
were adults with the same passions. Training, breeding, grooming, <br/>
showing, husbandry—all of these things I learned because I was consumed <br/>
by them!<br/>
<br/>
But, of course, dogs and horses are NOT school subjects—and are <br/>
completely unimportant in the school world. What if I had waited for a <br/>
teacher to come along and say, &quot;Today we are learning all about dog and <br/>
horses&quot;? Not only would I have waited all my life, the teacher would <br/>
only have given me a &quot;taste&quot; of the subject!<br/>
<br/>
OH! And you *can&#39;t* make a living with dogs and horses—right?<br/>
<br/>
Stage one is often referred to as DEschooling. It&#39;s the period of time <br/>
we need to give ourselves in order to &quot;step away from the box&quot; of <br/>
school and school-think. Ask yourself why and how you learned your <br/>
passion: whether it was music, cooking, flying, gardening, or <br/>
long-distance running. Or even more &quot;academic-like&quot; passions, like <br/>
Shakespeare, chemistry, World War II, or a foreign language. When you <br/>
are comfortable with how learning happens by indulging in passions and <br/>
making connections in your learning, you are quickly heading towards <br/>
stage two.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Stage II<br/>
<br/>
Once you are comfortable with the idea of immersion learning—and you&#39;re <br/>
over wanting or needing classes and structure, you&#39;re finally over the <br/>
deschooling hump and are actively in the process of UNschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Stage two involves really immersing ourselves—and allowing our children <br/>
to immerse themselves—into passions and even into slight, fleeting <br/>
interests. Seeing connections and making connections and yet realizing <br/>
that some things *might* not connect for YEARS is the most important <br/>
part of stage two.<br/>
<br/>
Connection: I remember lying in my bed when I was about 11 or 12. My <br/>
bed was behind the door, so that, when open, the door obscured the head <br/>
of my bed. I had tied a string to my doorknob. I would try to shut my <br/>
door with my finger at the point of the doorjamb; then I would open the <br/>
door back up with a pull on the string. It took *a lot* of pressure <br/>
(and pain!) to close my door at the point of the jamb. But every inch <br/>
closer to the door knob I got, it would be easier and easier to close, <br/>
so that by the time I was right at the edge of the door (by the knob), <br/>
I could almost &quot;blow&quot; it shut. I had &quot;discovered&quot; torque—but it had no <br/>
name!<br/>
<br/>
School&#39;s idea that children should be given the definition of torque <br/>
and then have it explained is backwards. It was so simple for me to <br/>
understand the definition of torque because I already had made the <br/>
personal and meaningful connection with my bedroom door.<br/>
<br/>
Passion: There are people who invest their time (and many even make a <br/>
living) studying Elizabethan fashion or reading/writing about the works <br/>
of John Steinbeck or determining whether an 17th century chair is a <br/>
forgery or watching birds make nests/feed their young or , as I heard <br/>
on the radio yesterday: there&#39;s this guy who&#39;s getting his Masters <br/>
degree in Soil Science! Go figure!<br/>
<br/>
If allowed (and often, even if not allowed!), a child will pursue his <br/>
career by following his passion(s). A wise parent will encourage this <br/>
pursuit of passion, because it may be what the child decides to devote <br/>
his life&#39;s work to. Maybe *more* importantly, that wise parent will <br/>
step aside when a passion becomes &quot;old&quot; because the parent will know <br/>
that *some* connection has been made with this fleeting passion.<br/>
<br/>
 From 10-12 years old, Cameron was a magician. I actually thought that <br/>
he would become the next Lance Burton or Jeff McBride (who once <br/>
referred to Cameron as &quot;mini-me&quot;). He was so passionate about magic, he <br/>
would practice and perform ALL day! Insert here: &quot;If I let him, Cameron <br/>
would sit around and do magic ALL DAY!&quot; Well, he DID! Until the day <br/>
when he quit. I was stunned! He&#39;d lost all interest. We&#39;d put thousands <br/>
of dollars into costumes and tricks and gimmicks and conventions and <br/>
tapes and books and private sessions with famous magicians—and he just <br/>
up and quit.<br/>
<br/>
At first I was incredulous. Then I realized it was just an intense, <br/>
fleeting passion. We still have a huge box of magic upstairs in the <br/>
attic. He can come back to it whenever—or not. What&#39;s important is that <br/>
it inspired him and fed a passion and entertained him (and us and <br/>
hundreds more). He met some truly fascinating people and made <br/>
connections that will last a lifetime—because he had an interest, a <br/>
passion.<br/>
<br/>
Stage one, deschooling, is a very uncomfortable time! It&#39;s a period of <br/>
intense questioning and of challenging yourself to think differently. <br/>
This is difficult, but it can be done—as with all learning: when you&#39;re <br/>
ready to!<br/>
<br/>
Stage two may be even more uncomfortable, because you&#39;re actually <br/>
putting the ideas into action: you&#39;re allowing the passions to take <br/>
over and you&#39;re not pushing the three &quot;R&#39;s&quot;. You are beginning to trust <br/>
that the child will learn, and you&#39;re respecting his choices. You&#39;re <br/>
UNschooling! And the more you do it, the easier it gets!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Stage three is freedom and joy and trust and respect and desire: <br/>
Radical Unschooling<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Stage III<br/>
<br/>
The third and final stage is when we can honestly and sincerely look at <br/>
ALL learning as equal and not hold one &quot;method&quot; or style or subject or <br/>
means of obtaining information above another. By stage three, we live <br/>
and breathe unschooling---it&#39;s such a part of our day-to-day living <br/>
that we can&#39;t separate it from our lives: it&#39;s not just the <br/>
&quot;educational&quot; part because *everything* is educational. We can apply <br/>
unschooling principles to bedtimes and eating and video gaming and TV <br/>
and &quot;chores.&quot; We know that our children will learn because it&#39;s what <br/>
they were born to do; they&#39;re hard-wired to learn. Learning is how the <br/>
human species survives and progresses and succeeds.<br/>
<br/>
This is the stage when we can effectively and confidently start giving <br/>
out unschooling information to the uninformed or misinformed because we <br/>
&quot;get it.&quot; We can live our lives joyfully because we&#39;re not worried <br/>
whether Susie will pass her algebra or whether Johnny will be able to <br/>
get into a good college, because they WILL if they want to. We know <br/>
that they will pursue their passions...well, passionately! And that <br/>
each day will bring more connections and learning opportunities.<br/>
<br/>
This is the stage when classes and instruction may eke back into our <br/>
lives, as it recently has in our family&#39;s. We don&#39;t give more weight to <br/>
the learning that is happening in Sociology-101 or karate or <br/>
bee-keeping just because it&#39;s happening in a classroom situation. A <br/>
class is just another means of pursuing our passions, making the <br/>
connections, and receiving the information. Learning happens all the <br/>
time in all places—*even* in a classroom!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to give the impression that acceptance of class/book <br/>
learning automatically makes you a Radical Unschooler. Stage III cannot <br/>
&quot;just happen&quot;: you&#39;ll have to go through Stages I and II first. For <br/>
those of us that attended school, deschooling will always exist at a <br/>
lower level throughout our lives. The next generation (our unschooled <br/>
children) will not have this stage to work through: they&#39;ll be able to <br/>
see all learning as equal and good from the get-go.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a process: getting rid of the school-think and structure, becoming <br/>
comfortable and implementing immersion learning, and *then* accepting <br/>
ALL learning as equally valuable.<br/>

&gt; door back up with a pull on the string. It took *a lot* of pressure<br/>
&gt; (and pain!) to close my door at the point of the jamb. But every inch<br/>
&gt; closer to the door knob I got, it would be easier and easier to close,<br/>
&gt; so that by the time I was right at the edge of the door (by the knob),<br/>
&gt; I could almost &quot;blow&quot; it shut. I had &quot;discovered&quot; torque�but it had no<br/>
&gt; name!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; School&#39;s idea that children should be given the definition of torque<br/>
&gt; and then have it explained is backwards. It was so simple for me to<br/>
&gt; understand the definition of torque because I already had made the<br/>
&gt; personal and meaningful connection with my bedroom door.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Passion: There are people who invest their time (and many even make a<br/>
&gt; living) studying Elizabethan fashion or reading/writing about the works<br/>
&gt; of John Steinbeck or determining whether an 17th century chair is a<br/>
&gt; forgery or watching birds make nests/feed their young or , as I heard<br/>
&gt; on the radio yesterday: there&#39;s this guy who&#39;s getting his Masters<br/>
&gt; degree in Soil Science! Go figure!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If allowed (and often, even if not allowed!), a child will pursue his<br/>
&gt; career by following his passion(s). A wise parent will encourage this<br/>
&gt; pursuit of passion, because it may be what the child decides to devote<br/>
&gt; his life&#39;s work to. Maybe *more* importantly, that wise parent will<br/>
&gt; step aside when a passion becomes &quot;old&quot; because the parent will know<br/>
&gt; that *some* connection has been made with this fleeting passion.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; From 10-12 years old, Cameron was a magician. I actually thought that<br/>
&gt; he would become the next Lance Burton or Jeff McBride (who once<br/>
&gt; referred to Cameron as &quot;mini-me&quot;). He was so passionate about magic, he<br/>
&gt; would practice and perform ALL day! Insert here: &quot;If I let him, Cameron<br/>
&gt; would sit around and do magic ALL DAY!&quot; Well, he DID! Until the day<br/>
&gt; when he quit. I was stunned! He&#39;d lost all interest. We&#39;d put thousands<br/>
&gt; of dollars into costumes and tricks and gimmicks and conventions and<br/>
&gt; tapes and books and private sessions with famous magicians�and he just<br/>
&gt; up and quit.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At first I was incredulous. Then I realized it was just an intense,<br/>
&gt; fleeting passion. We still have a huge box of magic upstairs in the<br/>
&gt; attic. He can come back to it whenever�or not. What&#39;s important is that<br/>
&gt; it inspired him and fed a passion and entertained him (and us and<br/>
&gt; hundreds more). He met some truly fascinating people and made<br/>
&gt; connections that will last a lifetime�because he had an interest, a<br/>
&gt; passion.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Stage one, deschooling, is a very uncomfortable time! It&#39;s a period of<br/>
&gt; intense questioning and of challenging yourself to think differently.<br/>
&gt; This is difficult, but it can be done�as with all learning: when you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; ready to!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Stage two may be even more uncomfortable, because you&#39;re actually<br/>
&gt; putting the ideas into action: you&#39;re allowing the passions to take<br/>
&gt; over and you&#39;re not pushing the three &quot;R&#39;s&quot;. You are beginning to trust<br/>
&gt; that the child will learn, and you&#39;re respecting his choices. You&#39;re<br/>
&gt; UNschooling! And the more you do it, the easier it gets!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Stage three is freedom and joy and trust and respect and desire:<br/>
&gt; Radical Unschooling<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Stage III<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The third and final stage is when we can honestly and sincerely look at<br/>
&gt; ALL learning as equal and not hold one &quot;method&quot; or style or subject or<br/>
&gt; means of obtaining information above another. By stage three, we live<br/>
&gt; and breathe unschooling---it&#39;s such a part of our day-to-day living<br/>
&gt; that we can&#39;t separate it from our lives: it&#39;s not just the<br/>
&gt; &quot;educational&quot; part because *everything* is educational. We can apply<br/>
&gt; unschooling principles to bedtimes and eating and video gaming and TV<br/>
&gt; and &quot;chores.&quot; We know that our children will learn because it&#39;s what<br/>
&gt; they were born to do; they&#39;re hard-wired to learn. Learning is how the<br/>
&gt; human species survives and progresses and succeeds.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is the stage when we can effectively and confidently start giving<br/>
&gt; out unschooling information to the uninformed or misinformed because we<br/>
&gt; &quot;get it.&quot; We can live our lives joyfully because we&#39;re not worried<br/>
&gt; whether Susie will pass her algebra or whether Johnny will be able to<br/>
&gt; get into a good college, because they WILL if they want to. We know<br/>
&gt; that they will pursue their passions...well, passionately! And that<br/>
&gt; each day will bring more connections and learning opportunities.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is the stage when classes and instruction may eke back into our<br/>
&gt; lives, as it recently has in our family&#39;s. We don&#39;t give more weight to<br/>
&gt; the learning that is happening in Sociology-101 or karate or<br/>
&gt; bee-keeping just because it&#39;s happening in a classroom situation. A<br/>
&gt; class is just another means of pursuing our passions, making the<br/>
&gt; connections, and receiving the information. Learning happens all the<br/>
&gt; time in all places�*even* in a classroom!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t want to give the impression that acceptance of class/book<br/>
&gt; learning automatically makes you a Radical Unschooler. Stage III cannot<br/>
&gt; &quot;just happen&quot;: you&#39;ll have to go through Stages I and II first. For<br/>
&gt; those of us that attended school, deschooling will always exist at a<br/>
&gt; lower level throughout our lives. The next generation (our unschooled<br/>
&gt; children) will not have this stage to work through: they&#39;ll be able to<br/>
&gt; see all learning as equal and good from the get-go.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s a process: getting rid of the school-think and structure, becoming<br/>
&gt; comfortable and implementing immersion learning, and *then* accepting<br/>
&gt; ALL learning as equally valuable.<br/>

I wanted to learn everything I could about them........But, of <br/>
course, dogs and horses are NOT school subjects and are completely <br/>
unimportant in the school world. What if I had waited for a teacher <br/>
to come along and say, &quot;Today we are learning all about dog and <br/>
horses&quot;? Not only would I have waited all my life, the teacher would <br/>
only have given me a &quot;taste&quot; of the subject!&gt;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; OH! And you *can&#39;t* make a living with dogs and horses right?&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There ARE agricultural high schools where these subjects are <br/>
studied!  My dd has decided she wants to work with animals, and she <br/>
wants to go to high school next year, and she wants to be around more <br/>
kids (she&#39;s virtually isolated, and believe me we&#39;ve tried to make <br/>
connections, other than occassional moments there&#39;s nothing on a <br/>
regular basis), so she has applied to the local agricultural high <br/>
school where they can study animals (yes, horses and dogs, among many <br/>
others, hands on), plants (flower arranging, landscaping etc), or <br/>
environmental studies.  We&#39;re waiting to hear if she was accepted.   <br/>
No, it&#39;s not radical unschooling, but it IS honoring her choices.<br/>
