<div id="ygrps-yiv-1775814550">Me and the kids have been participating in The Great Sunflower Project for 3 <br/>
years and it spretty cool to help them with counting the bees.<br/>
I just got this letter from them and found this new site and it looks pretty <br/>
cool:<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;In most parts of the country, nature seems to be tucking in for the winter. <br/>
Leaves are coloring and blowing in a chill wind. Our once robust sunflowers are <br/>
now burnt-brown seed-heads – picked at by wild birds. Honeybees huddle together <br/>
keeping their hives warm and safe for the winter. Bumblebee queens dive into <br/>
their underground burrows to wait out the dark months until flowers open their <br/>
blooms to them again. The phases of nature are beautiful to watch in any season. <br/>
These phases or stages of birth, growth, decay and rebirth are known to some <br/>
scientists as “phenology.” <br/>
<br/>
The word comes from the Greek word phaino , which means to “show or appear.” The <br/>
first leaves of a plant show above the spring soil, flowers bloom, seeds form <br/>
behind the faded blossoms, and songbirds long-gone from the fencepost now return <br/>
to harvest the bounty. Queen bees emerge to give birth. Nature shows us these <br/>
same wonders every year, but not always at the same time.<br/>
That’s why phenology is important. And, as our climate changes, we have an <br/>
opportunity to observe and record when these events show up from year to year. <br/>
The National Phenology Network (NPN), a partner organization to the Great <br/>
Sunflower Project, is tracking observations of plant phenology, just like we are <br/>
tracking pollinators. Tracking this information helps scientists know when <br/>
allergy season starts, when crops ripen and when fire danger is high. Important <br/>
timelines, and not always predictable unless citizen scientists like us help <br/>
out. If you want to learn more, check out the NPN’s citizen science initiative <br/>
“Nature’s Notebook” and record your own observations.&quot;<br/>
