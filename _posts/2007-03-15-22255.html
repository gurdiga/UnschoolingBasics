<div id="ygrps-yiv-1476036338">Hi all. As I mentioned before I am new to unschooling<br/>
and wanting to give things a different course of<br/>
action. My son (12) has a habit of teasing<br/>
(unrelentingly) his sister (5). This has been going on<br/>
for the last 2 years that he has been home from<br/>
school. Of course for the last 2 years we have not<br/>
been unschooling, and my son and I have suffered in<br/>
our relationship because of the situation. It is<br/>
always that he&#39;s the &quot;bad one&quot;  because he&#39;s the<br/>
teaser, and she is &quot;the victim&quot; because she is at the<br/>
receiving end, crying or screaming. It has been a<br/>
vicious circle and I know he resents her in a way<br/>
because she gets all of our &quot;good attention&quot; because<br/>
she is not the one teasing, and he gets our &quot;bad<br/>
attention&quot; because we are always fussing about why he<br/>
is teasing her. It has been *very* stressful for me,<br/>
and the regular talking about it to him doesn&#39;t seem<br/>
to help. We&#39;ll have a nice conversation about it one<br/>
night and the next day it&#39;s the same old thing. I end<br/>
up being very emotional over it, and am upset alot of<br/>
the time by it. I also am pregnant and don&#39;t think it<br/>
is so good for me to be this upset all the time. Help<br/>
please. Thanks so much! Heather L.<br/>
<br/>
