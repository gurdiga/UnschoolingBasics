<div id="ygrps-yiv-830722089">I&#39;m leaving for the Live and Learn conference tomorrow afternoon. I<br/>
work all morning and go straight to the airport after work, so<br/>
probably won&#39;t be on here for a while. Hope all is well with everyone<br/>
and I&#39;ll try to check in from the conference site.<br/>
<br/>
Take care everyone!<br/>

We won&#39;t be there either, except in spirit!   Yes, hopefully next year <br/>
for us too, especially if it&#39;s on the east coast.<br/>
<br/>
Carol, how goes the move?<br/>

<br/>
Slow !  We bought land in VA ( 18 acres !!).  Can&#39;t move until we sell the house :(<br/>
<br/>
Anyone interested in moving to Maine ? ;) How cool would that be ....... having an unschooling family buy here ?  I wanna go south ( whine whine whine ;)  We&#39;d definitely be able to get to the conference easier.<br/>
