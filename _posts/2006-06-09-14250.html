<div id="ygrps-yiv-2035005813">I don&#39;t think the TV or computer in my ds&#39;s room are ever turned off or down. My dd, on the other hand, is sensitive to sound and gets frustrated if there are too many things going on at once in her room. She likes to do more than one thing at once - gameboy and watch a movie or gameboy and listen to a CD, but only one sound on at a time.<br/>
   <br/>
  It makes sense to me. I am 39 and like to have music or a book on tape going while I am working (I am a digital artist) or cooking or whatever. When I was in high school and college and was writing a paper or working on a project I couldn&#39;t concentrate unless the TV or a cassette (CD weren&#39;t invented!!) was playing - the background noise kept my mind focused. Otherwise it wandered - I&#39;d be writing a sentence and wondering if Mom had been to the store yet or if my boyfriend was done with basketball practice -- whatever. I think it is my own personal &quot;attention trait&quot; -- I also read three or four books at a time - Not a disorder - just a thing I like to do! It makes me more interesting!<br/>

Neither of my boys does, but *I* did---go figure! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I remember one time, at my friend Sarah&#39;s house, we were sitting on her <br/>
mom&#39;s bed playing cards---rummy or gin rummy. The tv was <br/>
on---Gilligan&#39;s Island. Radio was on: we were singing along, but I <br/>
can&#39;t remember what exactly---I think it was a MoTown girl group. The <br/>
Monopoly game was on the bed---we rolled and moved as the other drew <br/>
and discarded or shuffled. We ate cereal. My mother called (so I was <br/>
also on the phone) and asked what we were doing. &lt;G&gt; I guess that&#39;s why <br/>
I remember it!<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t do that now. I do only 2-3 things at one time.  I now know my <br/>
limit! LOL<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine *now* concentrating on that many things at once.    <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-730127344">The TV is usually on as background to whatever DS is doing - unless he <br/>
decides he needs quiet to concentrate on something, then he turns it <br/>
off. For him, too much noise is too much input. For other people, they <br/>
need the sound. My DH for instance is constantly humming, whistling, <br/>
singing with whatever music is on. When I asked him about it, he said <br/>
that it helped him keep his thoughts in order. Being totally quiet in <br/>
quiet, his thoughts would fly by fast and furious and it&#39;d be like <br/>
mentally chasing kittens. With some sort of background sound, he can <br/>
herd those kittens into something approximating single file so he can <br/>
identify each one. For me, I like the TV on as background because it <br/>
provides a frame of reference for time passing - I&#39;ve got an <br/>
introvert&#39;s poor sense of external time, so hearing the start and end <br/>
theme music of Spongebob lets me know that 30 minutes has gone by.<br/>
<br/>
So, there you have it - one household, 3 different takes on background <br/>
sound.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-8898315">My dd14 has always been like that.  When she was little, she kept the <br/>
tv on all the time even if she was sitting somewhere else in the room <br/>
playing or reading.  Nowadays, she can be online IM&#39;ing her friends <br/>
while she has the radio and television on, and is talking on the <br/>
telephone at the same time.  That&#39;s just so much going on that it <br/>
boggles my mind but she&#39;s a happy camper.<br/>
<br/>
My ds9 and dd8 are not like that.  They only have something on if they <br/>
are currently using it.  My son easily gets over-stimulated so he <br/>
prefers quiet as much as possible.  My dd8 just doesn&#39;t see the sense <br/>
in having something on that isn&#39;t being used.  <br/>

understand about the TV being on as opposed to just music, I, too, <br/>
like to have music on when I read etc (and I ALSO read more than one <br/>
book at the same time! lol!).   She also likes a fan running at <br/>
night for white noise to sleep (we have to take it with us when we <br/>
go camping, and I think it&#39;s ONE of the reasons she has yet to go on <br/>
a sleepover).  She&#39;s used a fan since she was an infant, and now I <br/>
like it too as we were sleeping in the same room, so we run fans <br/>
year round!   And she always has it at a medium to low volume, <br/>
doesn&#39;t like things too loud.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1590167877">I am glad to know we are not alone in the multi-noise arena!  The boys<br/>
themselves aren&#39;t very loud all at once but Seth will do what is described<br/>
here: tv on, computer on, gameboy on and book out.  I am not sure if he goes<br/>
from one to the other or what but I cant have all that going on around me so<br/>
he has to do all that in his room.  I am one that cant handle too much<br/>
different noise.  It is extremely hard to focus and get things done<br/>
regardless so adding distractions to that just sends me over the edge.   I<br/>
don&#39;t freak out or anything but I just have to remove myself from the<br/>
situation.  It usually is when we are out at a store or something.  My dh is<br/>
very sensitive to this and if he sees me getting irritated he does whatever<br/>
needed to eliminate the noise factor...of course he is not always around so<br/>
I have to kinda monitor that myself usually.  But again, that is usually<br/>
when we are out of the house.<br/>

probably drive him over, and we&#39;ll stay at the splashpad in Norman  <br/>
until he&#39;s done, then come home. I am planning on driving down to  <br/>

This is my dh as well (and this is described as a trait of ADHD, <br/>
which, of course we don&#39;t care about in the unschooling world!).   <br/>
He sleeps with the radio on all night (another reason it&#39;s better <br/>
we&#39;re in separate rooms!  Keeps me awake...).  He also has to have a <br/>
running commentary at times when watching a movie etc, which drives <br/>
ME crazy as I&#39;m trying to focus on what&#39;s actually happening and <br/>
absorb it for later refection.<br/>
<br/>
I like to read (he does not) and often when I&#39;m sitting reading a <br/>
book, and he&#39;s in the same room, say watching TV, he starts talking <br/>
to me, doesn&#39;t even see that I&#39;m absorbed.   We&#39;ve discussed this <br/>
MANY times and my solution is to read when he&#39;s not here or in <br/>
another room (but sometimes I&#39;m really into the book and can&#39;t put <br/>
it down!).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; For me, I like the TV on as background because it provides a frame <br/>
 </span></blockquote>of reference for time passing - I&#39;ve got an introvert&#39;s poor sense <br/>
of external time, so hearing the start and end theme music of <br/>
Spongebob lets me know that 30 minutes has gone by.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is VERY interesting Deb!   Danielle has absolutely NO sense of <br/>
time passing, which, when she was in school last year, was one of <br/>
the worst &quot;problems&quot; in trying to fit in (getting her moving in the <br/>
morning to catch the bus, moving between classes, hard time <br/>
transitioning to get to the next class etc).   She&#39;s also a <br/>
visual/spatial learner, right brained, big picture, non-sequential <br/>
and part of that is her 3-D way of thinking.   Even though she knows <br/>
how to tell time by looking at a clock (both digital and analog), <br/>
she VERY often asks me &quot;what time is it?&quot;, and that&#39;s when there&#39;s a <br/>
clock in the same room for her to reference.   I don&#39;t think it <br/>
actually has anything to do with wanting to know the actual TIME, <br/>
but more with &quot;where am I?&quot; (and that&#39;s not a very good description, <br/>
I&#39;m still trying to understand - anyone have any insight?).  When I <br/>
ask her why she asks, she looks at me with a blank expression, she&#39;s <br/>
truly unaware of why I&#39;m even asking her.<br/>

Like in Dr. Who (the final episode for the season is on tonight! I <br/>

 </span></blockquote>well, yeah - to her time and space are all one large entity so <br/>
asking what time is it? makes perfect sense in orienting oneself to <br/>
the environment. I&#39;ll often ask DH or DS what time it is if I can&#39;t <br/>
easily see a clock and even sometimes when I can, if I know they can <br/>
also. DS is 8 and he already knows that quelle heur est&#39;il? (don&#39;t <br/>
know if I spelled that correctly) means I want to know what time it <br/>
is. Or, I&#39;ll tap my left wrist with my right index finger like <br/>
tapping a watch and they know.<br/>

<br/>
My dh needs to pursue this (sleep apnea), he keeps talking about <br/>
doing it but has yet to do so.   I can hear him snoring through the <br/>
wall with both bedroom doors shut AND a fan running near me!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, well, I was TRYING to get him to do this, but he (and dd) are <br/>
both so immediate, when they have something to say, they have to SAY <br/>
it right away or they forget what they were going to say.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s true for him, too, SOMETIMES, but quite often he expects a <br/>
response, and sometimes I really DON&#39;T have any comment (except <br/>
a &quot;hmmm hmmm&quot; etc).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Oddly enough, I&#39;m way more left brained, detailed, list making, <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m in the middle of right and left brained, but I AM more detail <br/>
oriented than either of them (I like making lists too).<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
This is exactly my dd!  And one of the reasons she was &quot;falling <br/>
behind&quot; in school.   I tried to educate her teachers (guidance <br/>
counselor, principal etc) about this, but got a lot of &quot;lip <br/>
service&quot;.  They were not interested.   So, I figured since I was <br/>
spending so much time with her at home after school trying to keep <br/>
her from failing her courses (never mind actually LEARNING the <br/>
material, how many really remember everything after they&#39;ve &quot;passed <br/>
the tests&quot;), then I might as well homeschool her!<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;I&#39;m still trying to understand - anyone have any insight?).&quot;<br/>

<br/>
I understand what you&#39;re saying (&quot;it&#39;s 4:30, and I know I have to <br/>
start making dinner to have enough time for it to be ready for when <br/>
dh gets home at 5:30 etc&quot;), but I&#39;m not really sure that that&#39;s how <br/>
she orients herself to place and time.   She often also asks what <br/>
day it is (not being in school, she has no point of reference as <br/>
she&#39;s been staying home quite a bit (not many outside activities, <br/>
like karate on Tuesdays, etc etc), except for the past 2 months <br/>
she&#39;s been going to sing in the middle school chorus twice a week (I <br/>
think I shared that story, of how she asked a few months ago if <br/>
she&#39;d be able to sing with them for the rest of the year?).  Even <br/>
then, I had to remind her the night before that I&#39;d be waking her up <br/>
earlier than her normal &quot;getting up when she was done sleeping&quot; time <br/>
to get there on time.   And I had to push her to move out the door <br/>
to get there ON TIME.  NO sense of urgency, as in &quot;oh, I&#39;d better <br/>
leave now because I know it takes us 5 mins to get there to be in <br/>
the chorus room by 1:15&quot;.   I&#39;m not like this at all (plus being a <br/>
musician, I have to be at a gig at a certain time, you don&#39;t just <br/>
saunter in whenever, or you don&#39;t get called again!  Plus you&#39;re <br/>
with a group that depends on everyone being there together to <br/>
rehearse or play, that&#39;s the point!).<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When I ask her why she asks, she looks at me with a blank <br/>
expression, she&#39;s truly unaware of why I&#39;m even asking her.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
This is still something I&#39;m having a hard time grasping right now.   <br/>
I need to chew on this some more......<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;ll often ask DH or DS what time it is if I can&#39;t easily see a <br/>
 </span></blockquote>clock and even sometimes when I can, if I know they can also.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
She asks whether or NOT there&#39;s a clock in the room, it doesn&#39;t <br/>
occur to her (it seems) to look for herself (and we have a clock of <br/>
some sort in almost every room!).   She&#39;s had watched in the past, <br/>
but is bothered by the feel of them (she&#39;s an HSP &quot;highly sensitive <br/>
person&quot;, I&#39;m grateful to Anne O and the &quot;shine&quot; group for helping me <br/>
understand this!   BOTH she and my dh are HSP!).  Some people would <br/>
say it&#39;s laziness, but I feel it&#39;s something else entirely.   Plus <br/>
she often has no clue how long she&#39;s been on the computer, and often <br/>
seems surprised it&#39;s been &quot;that long?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; DS is 8 and he already knows that quelle heur est&#39;il? (don&#39;t <br/>

<br/>
Don&#39;t know if it&#39;s spelled correctly, but I had 6 years of French <br/>
and I knew what you meant!  Lol!<br/>
Thanks for your thoughts Deb.   You&#39;ve given me some good things to <br/>
ponder.<br/>

come get Josh, if he wants to come...pretty much up to you all.  If you<br/>

The chocolate factory is not really much of a factory...mainly just a store<br/>

Kinda OT, I wanted to comment on the dream you shared a while back...WAY<br/>
COOL.  I really wish I could get to that place.  I keep telling myself that<br/>
once we get our own place I can be more free to let Seth do whatever but<br/>
there is a part of me that asks, why wait till then?  Another part of me<br/>
thinks I need to let this stuff happen slowly because of Chet&#39;s comfort<br/>

that you had that dream and are processing things as much as you are...what<br/>
a wonderful journey!<br/>

If you ever wanna call, feel free.  Home is 787-3855 and Cell is 476-0713.<br/>

I best get a shower (lol, no I haven&#39;t had one yet and it is almost 4pm) and<br/>
go get my paycheck before I put it off till tomorrow!  Talk to you soon!<br/>

Eh, the older kids are pretty good about it, but Sam and Dan both are <br/>
just not at that stage yet where they see their actions affecting <br/>
other people. They do pretty good as long as I&#39;m constantly <br/>
reminding them (and where&#39;s the fun in that?!)<br/>
You are welcome to our house anytime. Josh will be back from camp on <br/>
Sunday (we actually pick him up tomorrow but we&#39;re going to spend the <br/>
night over there and swim and hike). After that, he spends most of <br/>
June and July, Monday through Thursday at the summer school program <br/>
from 11am til ?. I&#39;m looking at Fridays as our fun day. ;-) I&#39;ll <br/>
probably drive him over, and we&#39;ll stay at the splashpad in Norman <br/>
until he&#39;s done, then come home. I am planning on driving down to <br/>
Paul&#39;s Valley to tour the chocolate factory, you guys want to tag along?<br/>
<br/>
SOunds like hell breaking loose out there, better go!<br/>
