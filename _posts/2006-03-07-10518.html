<div id="ygrps-yiv-1871572997">&quot;Income might also become more of an issue. I would love to hear from<br/>
more people where both parents work and can still unschool their<br/>
child. We don&#39;t have family near us, so our options are limited.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well, we&#39;ve both worked for most of our homeschooling and unschooling<br/>
journey.  Most of the time, I was able to just pick up odd jobs<br/>
(cleaning, babysitting etc..) where I wasn&#39;t gone for long, or I could<br/>
bring the kids along.<br/>
BUT, since &#39;01, I&#39;ve been working as a makeup artist for several<br/>
companies and am now full-time with Lancome. I&#39;m not going to say it&#39;s<br/>
easy, but I think about all the scheduling and stress of adding school<br/>
to our lives and unschooling is the BEST choice hands-down.<br/>
<br/>
My kids wouldn&#39;t be very easy to coerce at this point anyway!;)<br/>
Dh and I have always found a way to work our schedules around each<br/>
other and be creative. I&#39;m just getting used to being gone almost 40<br/>
hours a week, while he&#39;s home with them and it&#39;s NOT as fun as being<br/>
the stay-at-home parent!! wah...<br/>
<br/>
But things will change, it&#39;s not permament and my kids get to maintain<br/>
their very free lifestyle. Yesterday, they played outside almost all<br/>
day and when I came home from work, dh was playing Monopoly with them.<br/>
I know they&#39;re happy, loved and free. So it takes the sting out of<br/>
missing them so much.:)<br/>

I need to think about this some more. I&#39;d love to hear about some more<br/>
creative ways to unschool on a 2 income schedule! <br/>
