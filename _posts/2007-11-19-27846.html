<div id="ygrps-yiv-936501884">Ok, so the discussion about swearing got me thinking - what do you all do to<br/>
facilitate your teens learning about sex and related things? My 14 year old<br/>
(boy) cousin has been talking (actually texting) me lots of sex questions<br/>
which I have been happily answering honestly. We have also talked about<br/>
drinking and drugs. I am sure we will move on to rock &#39;n roll soon ...<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking of some great books that he could use - e.g. The Joy of Sex.<br/>
But his parents are very conventional and I am just not sure what their<br/>
response would be to me giving him a book about sex. Its not like I<br/>
encouraged him to go have sex - he&#39;d already done that before we started<br/>
talking about it. But there is a lot of information he just doesn&#39;t have and<br/>
clearly needs...<br/>
<br/>
So how do you all handle this sort of stuff at your house?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1334149731">Well, we talk about sex NOW, and the kids who are interested in our  <br/>
family are 12 and 8 (although my seven year old is quite entranced  <br/>
with the idea of a baby coming out of her vagina...&quot;Well, doesn&#39;t it  <br/>
HURT mama?&quot; Um....some, I like to think my answer had more grace than  <br/>
that. I&#39;m hoping that Josh will be willing to attend one of Diana&#39;s  <br/>
talks at the conference when he has more interest and less worry. We  <br/>
have lots of kids though, and I think only Dan and Avari haven&#39;t  <br/>
shown some interest in how it happens.<br/>
<br/>
I think having the trusting relationship that&#39;s part of unschooling  <br/>
helps so much. I just really appreciate that my oldest is 12 and asks  <br/>
me not just physiological questions, but also questions about  <br/>
emotions, morality, how to handle this that or the other. He knows  <br/>
that I won&#39;t freak out, and I am going to give him good information,  <br/>
as well as email him later with a thank you note and some URLs. Much  <br/>
like you and your cousin.<br/>

conversations. This means (to me) the expectation and trust the information<br/>
will be whole and true. When relaying information I keep in mind: Personal<br/>
responsibility, Safety, Love, Trust, Safety, FUN, Safety, Responsibility,<br/>
Fun, Honesty, Safety, FUN. :) In something close to that order ;)<br/>

which several teens thought were okay for parents to leave on their beds.<br/>
All (I met) who had these books offered, did read them. Playboy magazine&#39;s a<br/>
very intelligent men&#39;s magazine with not-very-explicit photographs. It&#39;s a<br/>
good one to have around or gift ;)<br/>

It&#39;s supposed to be FUN!<br/>
Hayden is just beginning to understand innuendo, double entendre and sexual<br/>
euphemisms, it&#39;s a really fun stage (I&#39;ve heard other mothers proclaim it<br/>
&quot;Fart Joke Stage&quot;). It&#39;s amazing to witness this development of adult<br/>
understanding, without any of the weird, shadowy, secret thoughts that<br/>
always surrounded that topic for me as a kid.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-920077084"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Well, we talk about sex NOW<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>YES! A woman I know recently said that she was going to need to have<br/>
&quot;the big talk&quot; with her son soon. Well, he&#39;s 13, so she&#39;s been<br/>
withholding information all this time because she was uncomfortable<br/>
talking about it. I guarantee he&#39;s definitely learned quite a bit from<br/>
other sources by this point. The big talk should have happened much<br/>
sooner. He might already be sexually active but she doesn&#39;t know<br/>
because she doesn&#39;t talk to him about sex at all. Maybe she just<br/>
prefers not to know.<br/>
<br/>
A better option than waiting to have a big talk is to have lots and<br/>
lots of casual, everyday-type conversations about it the whole time<br/>
they are growing up. Start talking about it now, whenever it comes up<br/>
or a kid expresses an interest, no matter what age they are. Keep the<br/>
channels of communication open. Be honest. Don&#39;t belittle or shy away<br/>
from their interest.<br/>
<br/>
A friend was telling me a story that involved a gay man and she<br/>
lowered her voice to a whisper because dd (8) was nearby. But dd<br/>
already knows what gay means. My friend said, &quot;Oh, you talk with her<br/>
about that kind of thing?&quot; Well, yeah! Over the course of many, many<br/>
conversations! Not a lot of info pouring in at once (unless that&#39;s<br/>
what she needs) but lots and lots of little discusses with honest,<br/>
straightforward info and back-and-forth casual chatting.<br/>
<br/>
The other day we were watching the tv show Friends. After a moment of<br/>
dialog between the actors in which they discussed a romantic situation<br/>
she asked me, &quot;Mom, what does sexual mean?&quot; She knew it related to<br/>
sex, but wasn&#39;t sure how. I&#39;m glad that she afraid to ask me or bring<br/>
up the subject. The more we talk about it, the easier it becomes and<br/>
the less discomfort I feel in discussing it. It is such a natural<br/>
thing, it&#39;s literally what makes life on our planet. So why treat it<br/>
as this big secretive topic??<br/>
<br/>
A friend of hers is not allowed to say the word sex at all (and<br/>
related words like sexy are off limits, too). Apparently when she was<br/>
six she was fascinated with the subject and it freaked her parents<br/>
out. They dealt with it by ignoring her interest and forbidding her<br/>
from speaking about it. I wonder if she&#39;ll want to approach them with<br/>
questions later on when it really matters...<br/>
<br/>
One of dd favorite movies is Marie Antoinette, which features several<br/>
scenes about how she couldn&#39;t get pregnant right away as expected<br/>
because her husband wouldn&#39;t sleep with her. DD pointed out that women<br/>
don&#39;t have to have sex to have a baby, which she knew from many prior<br/>
conversations (I think one started with her asking about how she could<br/>
have a baby if she didn&#39;t want to get married or if she fell in love<br/>
with a woman). And this time her observation led to a discussion about<br/>
medical procedures available today vs. what was customary back then.<br/>
<br/>
Lots and lots of small conversations.<br/>

<br/>
Exactly!!<br/>
If sex is a natural part of life (and it is) then why would talk about<br/>
it be less than natural and why on earth would unschoolers keep it<br/>
quiet? It&#39;s all part of learning. I think parents need to GET really<br/>
comfortable in talking about sex if they want their children to be<br/>
open with them.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t say much without permission from the child I&#39;d like to chat<br/>
about, but I can say that both my teens talk to me openly about an<br/>
assortment of topics around sex. Trevor has attended Diana&#39;s talk and<br/>
most recently he and his girlfriend and younger brother were at a<br/>
discussion hosted at a camp-out we attend with other home/unschooling<br/>
families and really enjoyed that.  They covered sex and a variety of<br/>
interesting topics. It was facilitated openly so everyone could share<br/>
their opinions freely. I think those kind of discussions are so<br/>
wonderful and one of the reasons we like to gather with other unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Trevor (17) is dating someone who is bi-sexual and very involved in<br/>
gay rights at her college campus. He&#39;s now gotten to attend some<br/>
events down there and watch a drag show. Having been on the edge of my<br/>
career as a makeup artist has also helped him learn about a variety of<br/>
issues and different segments of our society that people often don&#39;t<br/>
understand.<br/>
 <br/>
Sex has never been different than any other topic around here. The<br/>
result is children that ask me some pretty amazingly pointed questions<br/>
and tell me a lot about their thoughts/desires etc...<br/>
Do they tell me everything? I doubt it!!  They have a right to privacy<br/>
and what they share is their business.<br/>
<br/>
I love that we have open, non-judgemental adults in our lives that<br/>
they can trust if they want to talk with someone other than their<br/>
parents. I love that they feel comfortable in groups of adults, teens<br/>
etc...learning about these things. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1812083219">~~ Lots and lots of small conversations.~~<br/>
<br/>
Yes, and at the level the child wants it.<br/>
My six year old has some questions but really doesn&#39;t want a lot of<br/>
detailed information yet. We&#39;ve always thrown a bit of information out<br/>
and if the child asks more, we keep going. Just like with any other<br/>
topic, we take it as far as they want.<br/>
<br/>
He had this misconception that when someone was kissing and hugging,<br/>
they were &quot;sexing&quot;. We didn&#39;t try to correct him, but the kids would<br/>
say &quot;that isn&#39;t sexing Jalen&quot; once in a while.<br/>
<br/>
He finally asked &quot;what IS sex mom?&quot;<br/>
I said &quot;well, it&#39;s when people get naked together and love on each<br/>
other&quot; which is pretty vague really. He said &quot;OH&quot; and then...<br/>
&quot;when I&#39;m a teenager..............&quot;<br/>
and we&#39;re all waiting to hear what he&#39;s going to say, quite sure it&#39;s<br/>
going to be about sex when he&#39;s a teen!!<br/>
Nope.<br/>
&quot;..........I&#39;m going to beat my Zelda game all by myself.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We all started laughing because we were just sure it was going to be<br/>
about sex and he&#39;d already shifted gears and moved on to video games.<br/>

born. Both boys (now 6 and 3) have frequently been present while I&#39;ve <br/>
changed menstrual pads and menstrual cups. They have known how they <br/>
came to be on this planet since they&#39;ve known what the sun and the moon <br/>
are. As questions arise we answer them. They&#39;ve never felt that there <br/>
are some things we&#39;re not allowed to talk about.<br/>
<br/>
Wherever a parent is on their journey with parenting, I think it&#39;s <br/>
really important to not have some topics as taboo or reserved for an <br/>
older age. That doesn&#39;t mean that you volunteer all kinds of <br/>
information because you think it&#39;s &quot;time&quot;. But rather if your children <br/>
ask about something or seem curious about something it&#39;s because for <br/>
some reason it&#39;s on their radar screen and they NEED to know the answer <br/>
and the answer should come from a reliable source, whomever or whatever <br/>
that is.<br/>
