<div id="ygrps-yiv-51952949">&quot;(And Sandra isn&#39;t the only one with grown kids who&#39;ve been radically <br/>
unschooled for most of their lives. I have 1. Pam Sorooshian has 3 <br/>
also. Ren has at least a 20 yo and a few approaching and Kelly has 2 <br/>
(though the youngest might still be mid teens). If you haven&#39;t met <br/>
any of us and our kids, you should! I&#39;d pit our kids on politeness <br/>
and general all around coolness against Gary Null&#39;s any day ;-))&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
I would be honored to meet a longtime unschooling family. How could I meet one of these families and really see how it&#39;s done. I&#39;ve made some real breakthrough lately. I&#39;ve believed in the unschooling ideas for years, but I&#39;ve been so entrenched with various fears like health and money that I&#39;ve not been able to let go. I have wished that I could meet and see how someone lives it instead of just reading from these yahoogroups. <br/>

families. The  Unschooling Families on the Road list probably has  <br/>
tips :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-863177771">This is really a response to Monica and about meeting homeschoolers :)<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve only been on this list for about 6 months.  A year ago I didn&#39;t even know what an unschooler was!  However, I was priming the pump w/out knowing it by reading Alfie Kohn, John Holt, and Naomi Aldort.  My girls were in 2nd, 3rd and 6th grade.  We had a &quot;good school&quot; for elementary school and even though I knew that school wasn&#39;t all good I could never see enough bad to make the move to pull them out.  However, 6th grade changed all that.  I won&#39;t go into the long story, but it was horrible for my daughter socially, not meeting her needs intellectually and making our whole family miserable in the process.  In the spring we made the decision to homeschool our eldest the next year.  I started doing searches online and there it was: LIFE is Good Conference - an unschooling conference right in our home town only 6 weeks away!  Money was tight but it felt right so we registered.  That made a huge difference in our unschooling journey.  We went<br/>
 from knowing very little to jumping into the middle of unschooling culture.  And yes, there was some culture shock :)  At the conference I heard people on this list speak and saw families in action and could ask questions.  My kids had a great time.  My husband got to meet other involved dads.  We ended up taking all 3 girls out of the system and while the transition has had its bumpy spots we are all much happier and healthier now.<br/>
 <br/>
If you haven&#39;t attended a conference and it&#39;s at all possible - go.  :)  This week my eldest said we needed to go shopping at Trader Joe&#39;s and I reminded her that we also need to register for LIFE is Good this week.  She said the conference is more important than the food :) <br/>
 <br/>
Monica - no worries :)  your ability to hear what others were saying and being able to get past your initial reactions so quickly is to your credit :).  This IS all about learning.  It wasn&#39;t too many months ago that I got very upset at a response to a post and almost left this group, so I really do understand.  Now I *think* I get it, but I respond to other people&#39;s posts to see if anyone shows me where I&#39;m off in my response.  It helps me sort things through as I search for the right words to respond.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-958568831">Thank you Jenna! I am sorry once again! <br/>
I&#39;d like to go to one of those conferences but I am afraid I&#39;ll have to wait until they have one here in L.A. It is one of those things that I talk about it, read, watch videos about unschooling, it all makes sense but never saw one person who unschool just all of you in this list.<br/>
If anybody is here in LA I&#39;d love to meet them.<br/>
Thank you Jenna!!!!<br/>
And thanks all of you for the support!<br/>
