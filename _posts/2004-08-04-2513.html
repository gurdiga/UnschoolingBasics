<div id="ygrps-yiv-1751396926">Does anyone have teens that are going to both the Live and Learn Conference <br/>
this month  and the NBTSC in West Virginia in October.  My daughter (15) will <br/>
be at both and we thought there might be others at the conference who will also <br/>
be going to the camp.<br/>

Please e-mail me off list if you might be interested in meeting up at the <br/>
