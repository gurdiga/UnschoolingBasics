<div id="ygrps-yiv-993316643">~We have  been getting to know each other (learning each other), and she <br/>
will be coming  home to live the weekend after this one.  Her room is<br/>
ready and  gorgeous, and we are very  excited. <br/>
Two other pieces of  good news: First, we are cleared to bring her to <br/>
Albuquerque for the Live and  Learn conference. And best of all, we<br/>
are approved  to  homeschool from the very  beginning.~<br/>
<br/>
I am SO happy for all of you. Everytime I read about her, I get tears<br/>
in my eyes. I have to say, I&#39;m kinda hoping she likes makeup.;)<br/>

Yeah, well, I suspect that will very likely be  the case. She&#39;s pretty darn <br/>
girly.<br/>
