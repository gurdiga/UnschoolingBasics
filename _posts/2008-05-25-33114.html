<div id="ygrps-yiv-268611470">***we are just about to &#39;&#39;go without &#39;&#39;.***<br/>
<br/>
Why?<br/>
<br/>
***anyone else survive without it ?? ***<br/>
<br/>
The first couple years we were married we couldn&#39;t afford cable so we got one fuzzy local channel.   ( I think we could sort of get a second channel but more fuzzy and without audio.) <br/>
Then we got satellite, which was lovely. <br/>
Then one year David took a different job to be closer to home and his ailing Dad and we couldn&#39;t afford the satellite TV so we went back to our one fuzzy channel.<br/>
<br/>
We asked friends and family to record a few things they enjoyed if they were watching anyway and share with us.  We borrowed movies from friends.  We&#39;d invite people over to dinner and say &quot;Bring a movie!&quot; &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
We have cable now, happily, and a Netflix subscription and a change jar for renting movies from our local video store or for a night at the drive-in. <br/>
