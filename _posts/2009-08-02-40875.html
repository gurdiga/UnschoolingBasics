<div id="ygrps-yiv-45968478">Egads! I&#39;m late pulling this together! If you have blog posts you&#39;d like to share on the subject of Learn Nothing day _ or learning in general, or just to share, email them to me so I can get this out in the next couple days. They can be new or old.<br/>
<br/>
Next month&#39;s topic is food! So think about, blog about what and how you eat, what&#39;s in the garden, maybe, heck, share some recipes if you like. Again, old and new posts are fine. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks, y&#39;all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2099735416">We are practicing an unschooling life philosophy with our soon to be three year old. With that in mind, when she asks for something (material or otherwise) that is reasonable (from our budget&#39;s standpoint) and accessible, we always try to meet the need in a very timely fashion...luckily our toddler doesn&#39;t have terribly expensive needs! Additionally, in our personal lives, we try to model fairly non-consumerist behaviors...we rarely acquire new stuff (though we love freecycle) and do most of our cooking, crafting, and gift giving from scratch/ make-at-home type things. Also, my husband and I do not give each other birthday or holiday gifts...never have except maybe our first year dating.<br/>
<br/>
When I was growing up, birthdays were always about going to eat out, getting the gifts you had been wanting for a while, and a big party...none of which fits our budget or her desires. I&#39;m searching around for a special tradition that we can have as a family to mark birthdays, and was wondering what the rest of you did. Also, what do people do with the &quot;birthday gift&quot; issue (from parents to children) when kids are already getting the things they want &quot;just because&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Last year we were in the middle of 5 months of travel when her birthday came along, and she was not really aware of it as an &quot;event&quot;... an uncle whom we were visiting got a cake, and some plastic leis and we sang...it made a big impression on maya and she now asks for birthday songs all the time....so we do lots of &quot;pretend birthdays&quot;...sticking a candle in a pancake, piece of bread or whatever is around and singing...<br/>
<br/>
Looking for a way to make this special and different, also I will be giving birth about 2 weeks before her birthday so whatever we do needs to be fairly low key...probably a gathering of 4 or 5 close friends in a park.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, for families who do not do a big gift thing, how do your kids feel when they go to big parties with tons of gifts....or do i just cross that bridge when i get there? Thanks for the input and ideas!</div>

Mo enjoys this sort of thing, too. For years we had &quot;birthdays&quot; once or twice a week! But her actual birthday we didn&#39;t do really do anything different than a pretend birthday, other than know it was coming more than a day in advance. We were always wrapping and unwrapping things around the house - pretend presents, fancy snack packs that I created, whatever. She went to others&#39; parties, but never wanted a party with friends, just our usual , everyday sort of party.<br/>

<br/>
What did you like about those family traditions? On an emotional level I mean. Probably you are working a lot of that into your daily life, making every day a celebration! So the idea of family traditions may be something that&#39;s about you, about your memories and needs, but not your kids needs. I&#39;m not saying to ditch the idea, but if you see that its about you, not your kids, you can look for ways to meet your own needs, perhaps differently than you&#39;d otherwise envisioned. You might also look at the traditions that are forming, slowly and naturally, in your own family. My family traditions don&#39;t look anything like what I might have imagined beforehand, because I couldn&#39;t have guessed how my family would grow and change. More of my family traditions are kid-driven and transitory, too. They last until the kid who starts the tradition outgrows it, and by then we have new traditions. Its not what I was raised to expect of Tradition! but it fits our family well. <br/>

Does it even need to be that much? A gf of mine took her dd to McD&#39;s for her third and 4th bdays, and simply passed out party hats to anyone who wanted one, and folks joined in singing Happy Birthday over an ice-cream treat. It was enough of a &quot;party&quot; for her dd, and took a minimum of prep and stress. Her dd actively wanted a party, though.<br/>
<br/>
You could also plan a party before the birth, rather than fuss over the exact day - or have a party before and after if you like! Whatever suits your family best. Have a month long celebration of Birth, talking about your dd&#39;s birth and infancy and helping her connect with the new baby. <br/>

Morgan has never been upset about any of that - why would she be? We have birthdays all the time around here ;) And she gets &quot;big gifts&quot; when we have the finances available. She got a new bike at the beginning of the summer, without having to wait, and a new Gameboy just today, even though her bday is weeks away. Ray still gets certain sorts of gifts from his bio mom&#39;s family only on bdays and xmas, but those gifts aren&#39;t what makes those days special to him - if anything, they leave him feeling slightly jaded about his relationship with certain relatives.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1937333286">When my kids were little, we very often invited one friend to go <br/>
someplace with us -out to dinner and then maybe to some kind of fair or <br/>
a movie or, starting around age 5 or 6, to a live performance - usually <br/>
a musical.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t celebrate Christmas and we almost never had birthday parties, <br/>
so my kids never really got into getting a bunch of gifts at once. That <br/>
just wasn&#39;t part of their expectations....but we did use birthdays as a <br/>
time to get that big item they&#39;d been wanting. That was usually the time <br/>
we got them the videogame console or the little tv for their bedroom - <br/>
but that was when they were older. When they were younger, we got them <br/>
something that they&#39;d never asked for because they probably had never <br/>
even seen it.<br/>
<br/>
When they were younger, that was the time I&#39;d buy the super big box of <br/>
crayons for them and, when they were just a little older, the big box of <br/>
really good colored pencils.<br/>
<br/>
Every year there was always something cool that I knew they&#39;d love. When <br/>
they&#39;re little, just wrapping it in pretty paper with ribbon is enough <br/>
to make whatever it is really special.<br/>
<br/>
Now that they are older, I&#39;m really glad we have the go out to dinner <br/>
together routine - my kids are super busy at 18, 21, and 24, but we <br/>
still manage to all get together for dinner on each of our birthdays. We <br/>
REALLY enjoy it and it is well worth the money.<br/>
<br/>
We have a holiday that is four days (five days in leap year) that is <br/>
devoted to hospitality and service. When the kids were little, we <br/>
started a very cool tradition. Each night, we draw names. The next day, <br/>
we try to do nice things for the person whose name we&#39;ve drawn, but <br/>
without them figuring out who is doing these nice things. The next <br/>
night, we try to each guess who had our name that day. We also gave <br/>
little small presents to the kids each night - I&#39;m talking about little <br/>
tiny gifts - a few dollars at most. We also found special ways to be <br/>
helpful to other people during those days, too.<br/>
<br/>
Another holiday we have is the longest night of the year - we stay up <br/>
all night, have a fire in the fireplace, don&#39;t have computers or tv on, <br/>
and my husband tells stories (the old legends of Iran). We eat dried <br/>
fruits, nuts and seeds, and potatoes baked in the fireplace. We bring <br/>
blankets and pillows out to the living room and all fall asleep there. <br/>
Sometimes we have some artsy crafty stuff to do during the night, too.<br/>
<br/>
All that said, at 10 years old, Roya wanted a big birthday part --- so <br/>
we invited everybody we knew to the park, ordered cheap pizza, and I put <br/>
together a whole bunch of games. Rosie had birthday parties at a little <br/>
kiddy amusement park near us,  a few times. The cute thing about that <br/>
was that all the kids at her birthday party were much older than the <br/>
targeted age of the kiddy amusement park - but they were all <br/>
unschoolers, and they had a great time. The people running it were quite <br/>
impressed with how sweet they were and how imaginative.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry - scattered, but maybe some ideas in there for you, somewhere.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-243584247">Hi all - I&#39;m new to this group and have been enjoying lurking and  <br/>
reading the discussion.  My wife and I have an almost 2.5 y/o little  <br/>
boy and we&#39;re exploring unschooling.  At this point I&#39;m positive we at  <br/>
least won&#39;t be doing preschool, and maybe beyond.<br/>
<br/>
My concern is about reading.  Personally I read very very young and  <br/>
voraciously, and I have some of those same expectations for Finn.   <br/>
I&#39;ve adjusted them to expect him to read around 5 or 6 or 7, but I  <br/>
feel I would be concerned if he went much longer without learning to  <br/>
read.  I was taught to read in Montessori and traditional schools and  <br/>
it&#39;s something that I truly loved and never felt forced to do, and I  <br/>
am excited for my son to have access to that same world of learning  <br/>
and imagination.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my question: I&#39;d like to get some sort of grip on when  <br/>
unschooled kids typically start reading.  I need some reassurance that  <br/>
letting Finn read when he&#39;s ready won&#39;t result in him simply never  <br/>
being ready.  I know there are no studies, so just anecdotally, when  <br/>
did your unschooled kid read?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much!<br/>

<br/>
It might be more helpful to you, personally, to poll members of your family and find out how many read early and how many struggled with reading in school - a certain amount of what you&#39;re asking is based on genetic makeup. The &quot;normal&quot; range for learning to read is really wide: anywhere from 4 to 13 - seriously. Reading requires an assortment of skills, and not all of those will develop at the same time/rate. Looking around your family can give you some clues as to what to expect. <br/>
<br/>
As to never being ready - reading, in many ways, is an &quot;adult&quot; skill. Its not the sort of thing that&#39;s learned better for learning early, if anything, the opposite is more likely true. What hampers people who read later is years of being told there&#39;s something wrong with them for not being able to read. I used to teach reading to adults, and self esteem was The biggest hurdle. So the best thing you can do for a later reader is reassure him or her that s/he Will one day read, while being available to read anything at all for him/her.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-357580514">I have the two extremes...My son, Otto, read spontaneously at 2.5 - 3....I was nursing him and reading a book silently to myself, and he suddenly asked me &quot;What&#39;s decapitate mean, mommy?&quot;  I was shocked,  and asked where he had heard THAT word....and he pointed to it in my book.  I had no idea he was reading before this.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter, Lauren, could sound out 3-letter words at 5...but really didn&#39;t get the hang out reading until more like 10.  Again, it wasn&#39;t like she could read nothing--she could read very simple books and words, but wasn&#39;t able to sit down and read a &quot;chapter book&quot; independently until about 10.  She also spelled very poorly and is finally catching up in that area as she writes more.  She&#39;s 17 now, and reads and writes--well, basically that&#39;s all she does--in English AND japanese, and it&#39;s obvious to us that not pushing reading and writing does not make an adult who can do neither ;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have three grown kids - 18, 21, and 24. The 24 year old started <br/>
reading at 4 1/2 years old; the 21 year old started reading before she <br/>
was 3 years old, the 18 year old started reading at 8 years old.<br/>
<br/>
All three read voraciously.<br/>
<br/>
Each child develops according to their own internal timetable. I just <br/>
looked up the normal age for children to begin walking - the charts say <br/>
9 months to 18 months. That is a HUGE range (a kid walking at 18 months <br/>
old is TWICE as old as a kid walking at 7 months), and it isn&#39;t even big <br/>
enough. My youngest daughter started walking when she was 7 months old - <br/>
and I mean really walking, not holding onto anything, not just taking a <br/>
step or two.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing is true of reading - when kids are allowed to learn on <br/>
their own internal timetable, the range of normal development is huge - <br/>
3 years old to 16 years old are the most extreme ends I&#39;ve heard of. It <br/>
is my impression that most unschooled kids learn to read between 5 and <br/>
10, which is pretty much the same as when most kids in school learn to <br/>
read. But MANY learn to read earlier or later than that and the <br/>
difference between unschoolers and school is that we support that <br/>
learning WHEN it happens instead of trying to force it to happen on our <br/>
schedule.<br/>
<br/>
As unschoolers, we aren&#39;t trying to delay or speed up reading, but it is <br/>
helpful to recognize the advantages of delayed reading.<br/>
<br/>
Not-yet-reading does NOT mean not-yet-learning, of course, and it <br/>
doesn&#39;t have to even mean not-yet-learning from books, right? Kids can <br/>
be read to and can listen to books long before they start reading <br/>
independently. My own observation of a number of much-later readers is <br/>
that they develop listening skills that are extremely valuable.<br/>
<br/>
One always-unschooled young man I know did not read independently until <br/>
he was about 12 or 13 years old. He recently took my college economics <br/>
courses and he was the first student ever (in my 35 years of college <br/>
teaching) to completely ace one of my classes - 100 percent on every <br/>
exam.  He was able to sit and listen to lectures and absorb and <br/>
understand it all. The contrast between his ability to learn by <br/>
listening versus that of other college students was very great! When he <br/>
was growing up, not-yet-reading, he was read to by the hour, listened to <br/>
books on tape/cd a lot, and watched probably hundreds of videos of all <br/>
kinds. By the time he started reading independently, he was already <br/>
extremely &quot;well read.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Consider not putting so much emphasis on reading books independently - <br/>
it isn&#39;t as big a deal as the educational experts have convinced us it is.<br/>
<br/>
I, by the way, haven&#39;t read many books in the last few years because my <br/>
eyesight is very poor. I have listened to hundreds of books, however, <br/>
and I have discovered that I get much more out of listening to books <br/>
than reading them in print. The reason is that I am a very fast reader <br/>
and I tend to skim when reading in print, which I can&#39;t really do when <br/>
listening.<br/>
<br/>
There are also GREAT advantages - major huge gigantic wonderful exciting <br/>
amazing  advantages - to giving the child the gift of learning to read <br/>
in their own way and their own time. Turns out, reading is such a big <br/>
deal in this society that once a kid has learned to read without <br/>
instruction, lessons, assignments, modules, drills, tests, and grades - <br/>
that child will always know that he/she learned to read without being <br/>
taught. It is incredibly powerful - it carries over into everything - it <br/>
gives kids a kind of confidence and sense of self that is incredibly <br/>
valuable.<br/>

I too learned to read early and loved it.<br/>
I know several unschooled kids. ALL of them learned to read. Some as early as 3-4 others a lot later at 11-14.<br/>
My son started reading at 6 . He started his jorney into reading a lot earlier at 3 when he used to love to write words.<br/>
He never liked or got anything out of phonics. He never had reading lessons.<br/>

<br/>
I have no idea when I started reading. :)<br/>
<br/>
They are both excellent readers and, more importantly, thinkers.<br/>
<br/>
With a house full of books, computers, games, magazines and just real life, it never occurred to me that they wouldn&#39;t read. Maybe not what I read and certainly not on a schedule but they read just fine. <br/>
<br/>
They are now 14 and 16 and the biggest favor I think I have done so far is to get out of their way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-928301742">I thought I&#39;d have a hard time with this as well, but as I&#39;ve learned more (not technically about unschooling, either) and gotten to the point of &quot;School age&quot; with my oldest and now my second child, I&#39;ve found that unschooling just comes more naturally and I the wrote workbooks and busywork of even the homeschooling texts was so absurdly unnecessary (Saxon Math, for example!).<br/>
<br/>
There are two books that I&#39;d suggest that talk specifically to this concern about reading.  You should be able to find both at the public library or on amazon for a decent price.  <br/>
<br/>
The first is &quot;Dumbing us Down&quot; by John Taylor Ghatto.  He talks about what public school is really teaching our children (it works, it just doesn&#39;t do what everyone wants it to do --scary) and has a section in there where talks about how, when a child is ready to learn reading, writing and arithematic (not a set age by his standards either), that learning ALL of the above takes less than 100 hours total time as opposed to 6-12+ years of schooling.  Very interesting book and a good read.<br/>
<br/>
The second doesn&#39;t follow the unschooling style outright, but is a method that starts out VERY unschool-ish and even when it progresses to higher levels (or more hours) of learning, is still VERY much child-led and mentor-ship based.  Lots of parental modelling, and it explains that children have to learn to understand and use language first, that the formal reading and writing can come later when they are ready or need that, and as long as they can think and speak appropriately, it&#39;ll come at whatever age they are ready.  Here I am going on and on about a book I haven&#39;t told you the title of!  It&#39;s called &quot;A Thomas Jefferson Education&quot; by Oliver DeMille.  It is actually the style of homeschooling we will be following, but in our society, I need the &quot;Unschooling&quot; reinforcement to let go of the nonesense that&#39;s been pushed upon me for years and we truly are unschooling right now with lots of parental modeling (which is what it is!).<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck!  I honestly wouldn&#39;t worry about it.  Having come from the situation of having a bad reading experience in school early on (and I never had a problem reading) and then not reading a from 2nd grade through to my Junior Year of high school, I&#39;m more concerned about forcing the issue or causing negative feelings in my children.  They love audio books, love for me to read books that are WAY above their leve, etc.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2729493">My daughter taught herself to read at the age of 4, using the Leap Pad<br/>
phonics books.  SHE wanted them and SHE spent hours sitting there,<br/>
working through the books.  I never did more than buy them for her.<br/>
We reinforced it brilliantly (if I do say so myself) and<br/>
unintentionally by reading Magic Tree House books to her at bedtime.<br/>
We&#39;d read a couple of chapters, with her able to see the pages, if she<br/>
wished, and then she&#39;d stay up another hour or so, reading over them<br/>
again.  She apparently could remember what she&#39;d heard, so if she came<br/>
to a difficult word, she could figure it out.<br/>
<br/>
She is 10 1/2 now and a voracious reader.<br/>
<br/>
My son taught himself to read starting at the age of 2... just by<br/>
decoding all the symbols in his life.  It started with Wal-Mart.  See<br/>
the sign, remember what it says.  Went on to the names of all the<br/>
stores we went to regularly, then stuff in video games like &quot;play&quot; and<br/>
&quot;pause.&quot;  He can now read quite a bit, but accepts NO help or<br/>
correction whatsoever, so he gets some words wrong.  :-)  And he<br/>
doesn&#39;t give a fig about books. He&#39;s a gamer.  He likes to be able to<br/>
read instructions, play the games, and do stuff on the internet.<br/>
Books? Too dull.  Not interactive.  He&#39;s 4 1/2, so I&#39;m still hoping<br/>
the book bug will bite him later.  We have so many great books that I<br/>
think he&#39;d love if he gave &#39;em a chance.  But, he&#39;s got a different<br/>
world that he&#39;s interested in.  He doesn&#39;t even like most TV shows or<br/>
movies, because of the lack of interaction.  So... it&#39;s a personality<br/>
thing with some kids.<br/>
<br/>
I am pregnant again, and I have to confess that I probably will panic<br/>
if this next one doesn&#39;t learn to read until later... Having reading<br/>
kids has really helped smooth over all the relatives who are opposed<br/>
to homeschooling.  I&#39;m so grateful for this list, because I know it<br/>
will help keep me sane.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, for what it&#39;s worth, my husband learned to read at 2, thanks to<br/>
intensive teaching from a much-older sister.  And I learned at 4,<br/>
because my grandma/babysitter was a reading tutor.<br/>

50th anniversary of year for reading). Back in my early school days, it <br/>
was considered bad for children for them to read earlier than 7, so I <br/>
was actively prevented from learning to read. I remember asking my mom <br/>
and dad questions (what is this word?) and them exchanging a &quot;look&quot; and <br/>
putting me off. I remember sitting outside, kind of hidden away from the <br/>
house, with a picture book that had just one picture and a word on each <br/>
page and I was trying to figure out the code. I had figured out &quot;P&quot; and <br/>
&quot;A&quot; and &quot;M&quot; because of my name and, after &quot;A is for Apple&quot; the next word <br/>
wsa &quot;B is for Book.&quot; I remember the feeling of &quot;I GOT IT!!!&quot; I <br/>
understood that each letter was going to have its own sound and I <br/>
thought I just had to learn all those sounds in order to read. So I sat <br/>
out there in the sun, feeling guilty, learning the sounds of all the <br/>
letters. Interestingly, I still couldn&#39;t read. They didn&#39;t used to <br/>
actually teach reading until 2nd grade and the very first day of second <br/>
grade I thought the teacher would FINALLY explain it. But, no, a few <br/>
weeks went by while all we did was letter sounds, again (did it in 1st <br/>
grade, too). FINALLY the big books came out and Dick and Jane became my <br/>
favorite people in the world. Talk about ready to read - I was so happy <br/>
that it was &quot;legal&quot; for me to learn!!!<br/>
<br/>
My daughters each learned in their own way, at their own time. None of <br/>
them ever read in that &quot;I&#39;m-sounding-this-out&quot; kind of drawl. They read <br/>
the whole word, not the parts of the word, from the beginning. They also <br/>
read, from the beginning with great expression when reading aloud. So, <br/>
when I say the age they learned to read, I mean the age at which they <br/>
could read fluently.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1018482492">I don&#39;t know when my thirteen year old started reading.  I know at 1.5 years<br/>
of age he drew a letter &quot;B&quot;  I thought it was a bumblebee and praised &quot;the<br/>
wings&quot;.  He told me it was a &quot;B&quot;, but it never occurred to me he was drawing<br/>
letters.  I made buzzing sounds, showed it to my husband...all the usual<br/>
things a happy mother does with her firstborn&#39;s creations.  Two days later<br/>
he drew an &quot;A&quot; and it dawned on me he was drawing the alphabet:  it was<br/>
unexpected.  More letters followed the A, though not in any order!  Having<br/>
laughed at all the parents with alpha-blocks, drawing letters in sidewalk<br/>
chalk or with sticks in sand I was really perplexed how he had picked up<br/>
letters and their names.  I read to him and he loved to sit and have us read<br/>
book after book after book...<br/>
<br/>
He could print his own name before age two.  At age 6.5 he read the first<br/>
Harry Potter book.  That was when I knew he could read.  My nine year old<br/>
and six year old, who are his brothers read later.  In fact the six year old<br/>
doesn&#39;t read, nor write his own name.  Although at age two he could<br/>
recognize the word &quot;book&quot; in both lower or upper case letters.  I think<br/>
&quot;trust&quot; is the only word to describe my relationship to their attainments.<br/>
I trust they will get it.<br/>

Mo, however, dislikes being read to and always has - and yet she learned to read around 4.5. She did something similar to what Pam describes (although she didn&#39;t have to hide it) by looking at a lot of books with limited words, or books where every little thing is labeled and figuring out the letter-sound correspondences. Ray didn&#39;t read until around 7, and couldn&#39;t wrap his mind around phonics at all until after he was already reading.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Sierra went through several years of not liking anyone reading to her. She was ready for longer books, but couldn&#39;t comprehend when someone read to her. Children&#39;s picture books were ok, but nothing else. This year (she&#39;s 12, started reading fluently around 6-7) she suddenly discovered reading for pleasure. She read Skellig and LOVED it and is currently reading another chapter book. <br/>
<br/>
My two older boys don&#39;t read for pleasure, they read to get information. Jared will read these very complicated manuals and Dungeons and Dragons books that make my head spin...that&#39;s fun for him but he doesn&#39;t read novels or stories. Trust goes a long way in allowing each person&#39;s journey to unfold. Whether we&#39;re talking about reading or anything else.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone here need a dose of encouragement that unschooling is absolutely the best thing for your child, just check out this video I posted at my blog. There is NO way you could do worse than this....and no way you can make the argument that teaching equals learning after watching this. Here&#39;s proof that teaching a person has NOTHING to do with what they know:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2009/08/04/Hilarious-Proof-of-How-Bad-U.S.-Educational-System-Really-Is.aspx">http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2009/08/04/Hilarious-Proof-of-How-Bad-U.S.-Educational-System-Really-Is.aspx</a><br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-561758557">Well Meredith already pointed you towards my blog. That&#39;s Easy&#39;s birthday.<br/>
<br/>
Malila has had a variety of birthday party styles. She is very social and<br/>
wanted BIG parties growing up. We had not huge but well attended parties<br/>
with themes and bells and whistles (figuratively and literally). We had a<br/>
Harry Potter themed party for her 10.5 birthday (Her birthday is new year&#39;s<br/>
eve...) So we invited a bunch of kids and adults that loved Harry Potter. We<br/>
made stations of potions, spells, fortune telling, etc. We had games and a<br/>
Umbridge pinata (who wouldn&#39;t want to smack the crap out of her) and a<br/>
treasure hunt. I seriously went all out. Everyone came in costume. It<br/>
rocked.<br/>
For her 11th birthday she went to the midnight showing of Rocky Horror with<br/>
her papa and two friends. They slept over and had fun food. It was low key.<br/>
This year 12th birthday was 3 friends and a sleep over. The biggest request<br/>
was spray whip cream :-)<br/>

For the baby we did what the older two wanted. A small but lively party with<br/>
a few friends of all ages. Cake, pinata and presents. Not too many but<br/>
everyone was happy.<br/>
<br/>
My ds (6) talks about what he is going to do for his birthday ALL year long!<br/>
He has elaborate plans that change constantly. It is amazing to hear. Many<br/>
we write down :-) This year he didn&#39;t really want a party just a &quot;pool full<br/>
of candy&quot; so we did what we could! This year he wants a Lamborghini, lol. I<br/>
smile and talk about how cool that is. One year he wanted TMNT to come meet<br/>
him. His sister dressed up like on and hung out with him. It was really<br/>
cool.<br/>
<br/>
We go raspberry picking every year for my husbands birthday. Yum :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-209414152">OP: Also, what do people do with the &quot;birthday gift&quot; issue (from parents to<br/>
children) when kids are already getting the things they want &quot;just because&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
***Well my kids always want to explore new things. Or they want to expand<br/>
something they already have. I rarely hold back if I am able to give them<br/>
something that they want. For holidays that are about gifting I hold back<br/>
for a little while with a few things. I would surely give them something if<br/>
they were really bothered by it. My ds is, so we generally open a gift a day<br/>
and stretch the celebrating out quite a bit. It is exciting to get gifts so<br/>
they do really love to wait.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
OP: Last year we were in the middle of 5 months of travel when her birthday<br/>
came along, and she was not really aware of it as an &quot;event&quot;... an uncle<br/>
whom we were visiting got a cake, and some plastic leis and we sang...it<br/>
made a big impression on maya and she now asks for birthday songs all the<br/>
time....so we do lots of &quot;pretend birthdays&quot;...sticking a candle in a<br/>
pancake, piece of bread or whatever is around and singing...<br/>
<br/>
***excellent fun! We have done that a lot around here too! I am looking<br/>
forward to it again as the littlest is nearing her 2nd birthday and may be<br/>
swept off her feet :-)<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OP: Looking for a way to make this special and different, also I will be<br/>
giving birth about 2 weeks before her birthday so whatever we do needs to be<br/>
fairly low key...probably a gathering of 4 or 5 close friends in a park.<br/>
<br/>
***It can be anything that you and she want. It can be low key or a huge<br/>
party. What are you feeling up to, what does she want? Sometimes she might<br/>
want to make huge plans but not actually go through with them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
OP: Lastly, for families who do not do a big gift thing, how do your kids<br/>
feel when they go to big parties with tons of gifts....or do i just cross<br/>
that bridge when i get there? Thanks for the input and ideas!<br/>
<br/>
***We don&#39;t do a huge slew of gifts. We have once when a child needed that<br/>
but it isn&#39;t typical. NOne of my children (12, 6 & 22 months) has ever been<br/>
bothered by the amount of gifts they received or another child received in<br/>
front of them. My ds6 can be sad when he doesn&#39;t get things at parties so we<br/>
always have something for him too (we give all the kids a small gift to<br/>
celebrate a sibs birthday) or talk to him before and make plans with him to<br/>
handle it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-505210302">OP: My concern is about reading. Personally I read very very young and<br/>
voraciously, and I have some of those same expectations for Finn.<br/>
I&#39;ve adjusted them to expect him to read around 5 or 6 or 7, but I<br/>
feel I would be concerned if he went much longer without learning to<br/>
read. I was taught to read in Montessori and traditional schools and<br/>
it&#39;s something that I truly loved and never felt forced to do, and I<br/>
am excited for my son to have access to that same world of learning<br/>
and imagination.<br/>
<br/>
***I learned to read young (2) and had thought that typical. I have always<br/>
loved to read and read a great deal. Eventually I learned that it wasn&#39;t<br/>
typical that everyone learns on their own timetable. That everyones needs<br/>
for success in this life is different. I was fortunate that I learned to<br/>
read on my own as I am dyslexic. I would have failed in school had I been<br/>
pressured by their methods. I learned to compensate on my own, perfectly<br/>
tailored to *me*!<br/>
My oldest started playing with letters and writing words before she was 4.<br/>
She would write voraciously either asking for help or asking me to do it.<br/>
She was (and is) full of stories. She needed to get them out. Writing was<br/>
very important to her. I support her adventures with and exploration of<br/>
them. I read to her when she wanted me to. I got her audio books. She loved<br/>
to listen to stories. One day she wanted to hear more of a story that her<br/>
papa was reading her but he couldn&#39;t read any more. So she picked it up and<br/>
read it herself. Once she realized that she COULD read it she took off. She<br/>
started with The Neverending Story and then Coraline.<br/>
My ds6 is just beginning reading and writing. It is a joy to watch his<br/>
discoveries. I have no agenda as to when he can read well on his own. He<br/>
will when he is ready. He loves to copy the names of all the skateboard<br/>
companies that he likes from his CSS catalogs. He doesn&#39;t like to read<br/>
stories. He wants non-fiction. He use to want me to read &quot;Arms and Armour&quot;<br/>
over and over again.<br/>
<br/>
Learning can and does happen without reading. My kids learn through a<br/>
variety of venues, including TV, internet, videos, other people, doing,<br/>
experiences, etc. We all do.<br/>
<br/>
And Imagination...that comes from within. Reading doesn&#39;t make you more<br/>
creative. Imagination comes from creativity and thinking and dreaming among<br/>
other places.<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OP: Here&#39;s my question: I&#39;d like to get some sort of grip on when<br/>
unschooled kids typically start reading. I need some reassurance that<br/>
letting Finn read when he&#39;s ready won&#39;t result in him simply never<br/>
being ready. I know there are no studies, so just anecdotally, when<br/>
did your unschooled kid read?<br/>
<br/>
***unschooled kids aren&#39;t typical {bwg}<br/>
I can tell you about our family. I started at 2 and dh at 3. Our kids dd#1<br/>
started around 7 (maybe before maybe after). ds#2 is 6 now. He can read a<br/>
few things but isn&#39;t fluent. dd#3 is not 2 yet. She recognizes many letters<br/>
and a few words!<br/>
<br/>
My grandfather never learned to read. But it was because he didn&#39;t have the<br/>
opportunity. Because the life he lead didn&#39;t require reading. If your son<br/>
chooses a path where reading is important than he WILL learn. If you support<br/>
his interests he will feel good about whenever that is.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if Ren chimed in yet. She does a talk about reading. She has<br/>
two unschooled teens come up on stage. One read by 6 the other not until 12.<br/>
She has then read a few lines. Then you are asked to figure out which one is<br/>
which. She never tells :-) There is no difference. Even if you talk to the<br/>
kids you would never know. They are both bright, interesting, self-confident<br/>
and knowledgeable,.<br/>

When Mo was younger she enjoyed stencils of all kinds - shapes and letters and numbers. She also loved those big rubber mat squares and would separate the letters from the background and use them to build words or use them as giant stencils. That was fun for her. <br/>
<br/>
Its good to look for resources that line up well with kids&#39; dispositions and learning styles - but its also good not to hang expectations on those tools &quot;leading&quot; to reading in some obvious, direct manner.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2051955052">~~My concern is about reading.  Personally I read very very young and voraciously, and I have some of those same expectations for Finn.  ~~<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Expectations can really get in the way of the natural unfolding a person needs to do. My suggestion is to work on why that expectation exists and whether or not you&#39;re willing to let go of it and BE with what IS.<br/>
 <br/>
~~I&#39;ve adjusted them to expect him to read around 5 or 6 or 7, but I  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; feel I would be concerned if he went much longer without learning to read.~~<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why is that? Messages about when a child &quot;should&quot; learn to read come from schools, one of the most unnatural institutions to ever exist (in their current form). Is the concern that he won&#39;t read if it&#39;s not by a certain age? Is the concern about judgment from other people? What is the true concern? People don&#39;t go around talking about when they started reading or tying their shoes or riding a bike as a method to judge their current capabilities once they&#39;re adults.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 ~~I am excited for my son to have access to that same world of learning and imagination.~~<br/>
<br/>
If he learns to read early, then he loses other kinds of learning and imagination. Some people&#39;s learning and imagination are totally tied to reading early, other people have different forms of learning and imagination and it would be stifled if they read &quot;early&quot;. Be excited for him to unfold in his own way and time because THAT is a rare gift in this world! Be excited for your child to have access to learning and imagination of his own variety, in which reading will become a part when he&#39;s good and ready and not before.<br/>
<br/>
~~Here&#39;s my question: I&#39;d like to get some sort of grip on when  unschooled kids typically start reading.~~<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d guess later than most, in general. Because we don&#39;t push and prod and say &quot;look, he&#39;s reading&quot; when a child reads 2-3 words or stumbles around a simple child-reader book that is dumbed down. Trust means that children read when it&#39;s comfortable, in their own unique way at whatever age they become capable of decoding. Out of four children I have one that started at 8-9, one at 12, one at 6-7 and my youngest is currently just beginning to recognize a few letters at age 8.5.<br/>
<br/>
I guarantee you can&#39;t tell who read first, or better or fastest when they&#39;re 20 years old. Heck, you can&#39;t tell with my three reading children and Jared (who started at 12 and is now almost 16) has the least experience yet reads as good as any adult I know.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~I need some reassurance that letting Finn read when he&#39;s ready won&#39;t result in him simply never being ready.~~<br/>
<br/>
Find me a grown unschooled kid who is illiterate. Just one. A single ONE would crash all my theories and trust. I don&#39;t know of one...anywhere, ever. I know of some schooled kids who think they&#39;re dumb and developmentally &quot;delayed&quot; and even some who grow up illiterate. Find me a single illiterate person who did not go to school! Just one. They all started out in school and decided they weren&#39;t intelligent, capable human beings at some point and gave up. That&#39;s what the system can do to some people.<br/>
<br/>
I imagine Jared (16) would have had tremendous pressure and destructive labels had he struggled with reading in school. Thank goodness he was free to learn in his own time and does not think it weird or strange that he learned to read at 12 instead of 6. Prescribed time tables for learning are false and not based on human development at ALL. Trusting your child means letting go of &quot;norms&quot; and time tables and simply being with them, in their own learning journey. <br/>
