 </span></blockquote>OK&lt; I&#39;ve seen the ad and I found it a riot!  LOL!!  But I can see <br/>
how a child could feel uneasy about it.  How much do you have <br/>
to &quot;protect&quot; your child?  That&#39;s hard to tell a parent.  Children <br/>
are generally going to watch those things that interest them.  <br/>
Younger children are going to be more interested (generally) in <br/>
Dora, Blue&#39;s Clues, PBS kids shows, etc.  Older kids are going to <br/>
diversify according to their interests.  I say if you are concerned <br/>
about what your children are watching then maybe sit and watch some <br/>
telly with them.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think you need to &quot;protect&quot; them from tv or any media but I think you have to be available to help them process it.  <br/>
<br/>
We have kids from 14 to 5 and about 500 tv channels.  We don&#39;t have any blocks but the kids really aren&#39;t interested in stuff that is &quot;above their maturity level.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I do find that when they are at friends&#39; houses they are into more intense things and we talk about them but I don&#39;t forbid them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2056345242">Mostly, we are with or nearby to DS (almost 7) when he&#39;s watching <br/>
TV. He&#39;s seen ads for stuff (especially movie trailers) that were <br/>
scary and he usually heads for the closest lap to snuggle and feel <br/>
safe. He saw the trailer for the last Harry Potter movie and <br/>
said &quot;You and Daddy can go see that without me. It looks too scary <br/>
for me.&quot; And, too, while most of what he likes to watch <br/>
is &quot;children&#39;s programming&quot;, he also likes things like MythBusters <br/>
which are not on &quot;children&#39;s programming&quot; channels. Lots of being <br/>
available to him for comfort and talking with him about it seem to <br/>
really be the keys moreso than prohibiting things.</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wait.  So we send dads and moms off to fight actual wars but a blob on TV is<br/>
too traumatic for children - and must be banned?  Whoa.  That&#39;s the first<br/>
thing that popped into my head.  Where were the parents?  If the parents<br/>
response was laughter at such a silly commercial, the children would see<br/>
that and understand that it was not &quot;real&quot; right?<br/>
<br/>
I remember my first nightmare.  It was so scary that I couldn&#39;t sleep at<br/>
night.  It was of Bigbird, from Sesame Street, jumping rope to the sound of<br/>
my heartbeat.  Bigbird scared me as a baby.  I really remember being in my<br/>
crib, because I was from the generation that lived in the crib.  That&#39;s why<br/>
we never used a crib here with my children.  If you have ever heard of the<br/>
Suzuki method, then you would never want a crib in your house.  LOL  the<br/>
bars (If I haven&#39;t gotten my wires crossed)<br/>
<br/>
We used our camcorder (is that what they are still called) to film a<br/>
homemade play that the kids wrote and starred in.  We watched it several<br/>
times on the television.  I hope that this showed my children and even the<br/>
three year old about how not all things on television are real.<br/>
<br/>
Just thoughts.<br/>

&gt; Rebecca<br/>
 </span></blockquote>LOL There have been times when *I&#39;ve* been upset by something <br/>
fictional on TV or in a movie and *DS* reminds me it&#39;s not real. <br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s not sure about something, he&#39;ll ask &quot;Is that fiction or non-<br/>
fiction?&quot; Opens up lots of discussion on real, not real, and semi-<br/>
real - real people, perhaps, or possibly real situations, but in a <br/>
fictional setting - MythBusters is real (real people in real <br/>
situations doing real things); Pokemon is not real (cartoon <br/>
character people with not real abilities in a whole other <br/>
place/time); Recess is semi-real (cartoon character people in <br/>
possibly real situations); Star Trek is semi-real (real people in <br/>
far out places) - same kinds of discussions we&#39;ve had about video <br/>
games. DS loves the 007 games so we&#39;ve talked about things like <br/>
mines (in the game, you get killed and you come back and there are <br/>
no civilians around, in real life mines get left behind and <br/>
civilians, sometimes kids, get hurt or killed by them...)</div>

nightmare that had me scared he would come out of the toilet!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s tough. I turned on a show about the Golden Gate Bridge to show <br/>
ds (4). Then they started talking about the 1989 earthquake, which I <br/>
didn&#39;t expect because it didn&#39;t damage the GG. They started showing a <br/>
lot of footage of all the damage it did cause, Mikey heard them say <br/>
50 people died, and repeated that. The remote wasn&#39;t next to me and I <br/>
didn&#39;t want to make a big deal of leaping across the room and <br/>
changing the channel, so I just tried to talk about what they were <br/>
showing in a calm voice. I mentioned that I didn&#39;t live there at the <br/>
time, but that other family members did. Figured that would give him <br/>
a chance to bring it up again if he wanted to. <br/>
<br/>
Didn&#39;t mention that Grandpa was on a section of freeway that <br/>
collapsed! (he got off in time) <br/>
<br/>
Mikey hasn&#39;t brought it up yet (it was last weekend). Just have to <br/>
take it one thing at a time. He&#39;s afraid of a toy our neighbor has, <br/>
and has to make sure that the boy&#39;s mom has moved it out of J&#39;s room <br/>
before he&#39;ll go over there. You just never know what they will have a <br/>
big reaction to.<br/>
<br/>
He is so innocent about all the bad in the world, natural or man-<br/>
made. I&#39;m still amazed that he hasn&#39;t seen footage of the planes <br/>
flying into the WTC. My neighbor had something on about it last year <br/>
but somehow Mikey never looked at the tv at the &#39;right&#39; time.<br/>

We love watching what they are going to do to Buster next!!  My <br/>
daugher has friends who are in public school and would never venture <br/>
into the Discovery channel section or watch anything on TLC or HGTV, <br/>
yet Emily is constantly awake at 1 am watching something on one of <br/>
those channels.  <br/>
<br/>
We got hooked onto Mythbusters when they proved that microwaved water <br/>
can &quot;erupt&quot;  Someone told us about it after it happened to us (I <br/>
always thought it was a myth) and we caught it and got hooked.<br/>

likes when they blow stuff up (did you see the exploding port-a-<br/>
potty episode?) I like the &quot;mythterns&quot; they&#39;ve added - gives them a <br/>
lot more flexibility on what kinds of stuff they do. And it would be <br/>
fun to have all that ballistics gel and such on hand to play with <br/>
(DH would love to have their workshop!)</div>

I would never take my husband&#39;s old &#39;64 Chevy truck away from him and I<br/>
bet I could find a lot of statistics about motor vehicle accidents.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t take his fly rod away even though he&#39;s been injured while<br/>
fishing and even chased into the Little Blackfoot by a bear!  (that&#39;s a<br/>
terrible story,  he can&#39;t honestly be a fisherman because he didn&#39;t have<br/>
a monster fish on the line at the time he had to out-wade the bear. Any<br/>
respectable fisherman would have had a story about how big that fish was<br/>
and how he held on to it the whole time he was struggling to get away<br/>
from the bear and how the fish only got away after the bear had given up.<br/>
No.  Not David.  He had no fish and fell into a hole and filled his<br/>
waders and nearly washed down stream. &lt;G&gt;) <br/>
<br/>
***What about all the information that we have about how tv affects our <br/>
children&#39;s brain development,***<br/>
<br/>
Cave children watched family unit members have sex, watched animals being<br/>
killed and cut up, watched women have babies, watched fights, watched<br/>
people take a poo. (or more accurately, leave a poo)  (I think if a<br/>
person took poo he&#39;d have some kind of problem, really.)<br/>
<br/>
We have no studies about how that affected their brains but at least some<br/>
of them went on to become... us. <br/>
Victorian kids survived the heinous dime store novels the experts said<br/>
would be the downfall of society.<br/>
European children of the forties experienced and saw and lived through<br/>
unspeakable horrors.  Probably there are brain studies but the survivors<br/>
I knew lived out normal lives and were fine people. <br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t even know a fraction of the truth about the human brain and yet<br/>
lots of people believe electronic media will harm our children more than<br/>
say, a parent hitting a kid, a kid being sent to bed without supper, a<br/>
kid being drugged into compliance,  a kid being punished by being<br/>
confined to one room, having possessions taken away, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
My own studies indicate (I&#39;ve studied one kid for almost thirteen<br/>
years&lt;g&gt;) that a kid who watches TV is ok.   If the kid wasn&#39;t ok, I<br/>
would examine relationship issues with mom and dad, general health,<br/>
happiness, etc., before I&#39;d assume the problem was caused by TV.<br/>
<br/>
Dylan will be thirteen soon and so far brain development seems to be okey<br/>
dokey.  He&#39;s having no problems learning or doing any of the things he<br/>
wants to learn and do.  He&#39;s smarter and better informed than a lot of<br/>
adults I know. <br/>
<br/>
***Not to mention how ads affect them.***<br/>
<br/>
This was the most interesting thing for me to watch.  Dylan loved TV<br/>
commercials.  He spent some little while thinking all that stuff was true<br/>
and we talked about advertising and we went out and bought some stuff<br/>
just to see if it was what the ad said it was. <br/>
We were sometimes pleasantly surprised and sometimes we were smugly happy<br/>
to have discovered their deception. <br/>
He became very aware of the techniques advertisers use to stimulate our<br/>
interests and create a feeling of need for the product. He loves the<br/>
psychology of advertising.   He&#39;s the most careful shopper I know and has<br/>
looked up consumer reports on more than one higher priced item when he<br/>
was considering a purchase.   He will probably never be an impulse buyer<br/>
and probably make few purchases he regrets.  That happened because he was<br/>
free to see ads and commercials and had time to experiment and consider. <br/>
 I&#39;m so glad he got to think about these things at an early age because I<br/>
think it means he&#39;ll be less likely to spend his rent money on some<br/>
impulsive purchase when he&#39;s on his own.  His ability to fool around with<br/>
advertising and buying happened when he was young and he didn&#39;t stand to<br/>
lose his home or car or stereo system.  <br/>
<br/>
Our experience has been that TV is not a problem.  Dylan has had no TV<br/>
restrictions.  He was not really interested in TV when he was very small.<br/>
 I think he began watching with real interest during a TNT Monster Vision<br/>
Bash marathon of Godzilla movies when he was four, or so.  &lt;g&gt;  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-661445052">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;What about all the information that we have about how tv affects our <br/>
children&#39;s brain development, particularly in children under 2.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Have you read how some these studies are conducted and what they are<br/>
measuring? Some of them are just plain goofy. One fairly recent example -<br/>
Result: A child&#39;s brainwaves show &quot;less activity&quot; when watching TV than when<br/>
engaging in another activity. Deduced from: Comparing the relaxed and happy<br/>
tv watcher with the &quot;other activity&quot; which turns out to be lying alone on a<br/>
bed in a darkened room where the child might be bored, scared, irritated at<br/>
the waste of time, listening intently, making up stories in their mind - who<br/>
knows? - but probably not relaxed and happy.<br/>
<br/>
They put on a tv in a room with nothing else to do and are judgmental when<br/>
the kid is drawn to the tv.<br/>
<br/>
They put attractive, new programming on a tv in a room where the choice is<br/>
watch tv or play with some toys that are Waldorfy plain or probably<br/>
familiar, or even what the kids already have at home. Kids in real homes<br/>
often do both at once.<br/>
<br/>
They grumble that kids find tv attractive when it is specifically and<br/>
cleverly designed by the makers to appeal to kids. What, they should take a<br/>
leaf out of school&#39;s book and deliberately make it boring?<br/>
<br/>
They speak in a voice of doom when kids want to act out with action figures<br/>
some of the more violent or heroic stories they see on tv, instead of seeing<br/>
the acting out as *healthy* processing.<br/>
<br/>
They, they, they. Screw &#39;em. No one&#39;s Unschooling home, with free access to<br/>
tv resembles any of the study environments. No one&#39;s Unschooled kids seem to<br/>
exhibit one iota of harm in the long run from free access to tv.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Not to mention how ads affect them.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How do ads affect your 2 year old? Jayn was a lot less interested in tv and<br/>
dvd&#39;s when she was 2. Now at 5 her favorite shows are on channels without<br/>
ads for the most part - which is good luck for me I guess. <br/>
<br/>
It is true that she sees things that she might like on ads. We will go and<br/>
look at them at the store if her interest continues. Sometimes she still<br/>
wants them, other times not. We talk about ideas that are presented in both<br/>
ads and programming, especially when the behaviors exhibited are contrary to<br/>
the life of freedom and joy that we enjoy. For example parents in sit-coms<br/>
are always grounding their kids, usually after the moral has been learned by<br/>
the kids. We talk about how dopey, sad and unproductive that is.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;When you say they pretty much watch what they want I envision a <br/>
television that is on all day.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
People first coming to Unschooling often have this kind of dichotomy of<br/>
extremes in their minds. Not just with tv, people find it hard to see<br/>
anything other than &lt;parental control/enforced limits&gt; or &lt;total dangerous<br/>
chaos&gt;. The assumption behind this paradigm is that children will always<br/>
choose the negative or harmful or irresponsible alternative when choices are<br/>
offered. The great thing about reading for longer on these lists is that<br/>
another picture of how these ideas work in real life replaces that paradigm<br/>
of either/or. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the tv is on all day at our house, but usually because there is a<br/>
shifting dynamic of who is utilizing it at different times. Sometimes it is<br/>
just background; at others there is common consent, or Jayn-driven, desire<br/>
for quiet. Sometimes it is a &quot;movie marathon&quot; - repeated showings of Jayn&#39;s<br/>
latest dvd acquisition, or a recorded series. <br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I agree that watching with them so you can <br/>
answer questions is wonderful - turning it off is even better!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Making a judgment of &quot;better&quot; should probably be done in a context rather<br/>
than as an absolute.<br/>
<br/>
For example turning it off when no-one is watching it might be better than<br/>
leaving it on in an empty room and burning electricity.<br/>
<br/>
Turning it off is better than leaving it on when everyone wants to turn it<br/>
off - as against forcing people to watch tv if they don&#39;t want to. (Like<br/>
that would ever happen??? See the movie &quot;Matilda&quot; for a lighthearted take on<br/>
that very occurrence.)<br/>
<br/>
Turning it off is not better when someone else is trying to watch something,<br/>
or is enjoying having it on. Turning it off is not better if it is a coerced<br/>
action. Turning it off is not better if the result is resentment or<br/>
wistfulness. <br/>
<br/>
Turning it off is not better if watching tv together is very important to<br/>
your child right now, and by watching with them you are showing your trust<br/>
in them, and approval of their interests. It might however be better than<br/>
watching with a disapproving or critical attitude, or one that disparages<br/>
the shows, although taking yourself away could be a &quot;better&quot; alternative in<br/>
that situation.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing that you are using the phrase &quot;turn it off&quot; as code for &quot;do<br/>
something else together&quot;. Nothing will make your kid resent an activity than<br/>
being forced to do it against their true free will, or being manipulated<br/>
into it, even if gently, by parental judgments. If you want them to join you<br/>
in some other activity one answer is to do it yourself with your own honest,<br/>
not exaggerated, enjoyment, making being with you attractive and full of<br/>
love.<br/>
<br/>
Robyn L. Coburn<br/>
<br/>
PS I looked at the article about the marmite blob, and had to chuckle. Jayn<br/>
would probably be amused or curious; without having actually seen &quot;The Blob&quot;<br/>
would miss part of the joke. However she is 5. I don&#39;t know how she would<br/>
have reacted when a toddler. Usually she would leave or turn away if<br/>
something was unattractive for any reason. Older - she asked for fast<br/>
forward or skipping the scene.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-954519007">My kids&#39; tv-watching was never &quot;limited.&quot; We had no rules, no <br/>
restrictions on when or what they watched. But they never had the tv on <br/>
all day, either. That&#39;s because they had lots of other things to do - <br/>
they played dress-ups, for example, for hours and hours, when they were <br/>
little. And we went to parks and the beach and children&#39;s museums and <br/>
many other places, a lot, too. And we have a swimming pool - they often <br/>
spent 8 hours a day, for days in a row, in the pool when the weather <br/>
was good.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think sitting in front of a tv for 8 hours a day, day after <br/>
day, is good for little kids, either. If I noticed my child doing that, <br/>
day after day, I&#39;d be concerned. But I think just pulling the plug is a <br/>
wussy parental response. If the child is choosing tv, then that&#39;s the <br/>
best choice he/she has and that&#39;s the fault of the parents, not the <br/>
kid. It is good information for the parent to know that the life <br/>
they&#39;re created is not as interesting as what is on tv. It is a <br/>
parent&#39;s job to enrich a child&#39;s life. Pulling the plug doesn&#39;t enrich <br/>
a child&#39;s life, it reduces his/her options.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are VERY selective tv-watchers now - at 14, 17, and 20. They <br/>
watch West Wing - they get the old seasons from Netflix and watch every <br/>
episode over and over, as well as keep up on the new season. They&#39;re <br/>
learning HUGE amounts about politics and government and lots of bits of <br/>
a wide variety of other topics - like middle east geography or about <br/>
national land holdings, etc., whatever happens to be the topic on West <br/>
Wing. They also watch the Gilmore Girls pretty regularly - I know what <br/>
they like about it - it is an in-depth examination of what can go right <br/>
and wrong in relationships between mothers and daughters and friends <br/>
and lovers. They&#39;re critical of this show itself - sometimes they point <br/>
out flaws in the writing, for example. And - there is much about the <br/>
actual behavior of the characters in the show that they don&#39;t approve <br/>
of (well - okay - they&#39;ve taken to referring to  more recent seasons as <br/>
&quot;the Gilmore Sluts.&quot;). Those are the only two shows my 3 girls watch on <br/>
a fairly regular basis. Rosie and Roxana also watch something on <br/>
Nick-at-Night - Cosby Show, Roseanne, or whatever is on around 11 pm, <br/>
most nights. That is sort of their wind-down get-to-sleep routine. <br/>
Other than those shows, they SELDOM turn on the tv - they&#39;re busy <br/>
people. My husband watches a LOT of soccer - international soccer. And <br/>
he watches movies - sometimes one of the rest of us watches his movies <br/>
with him, but he&#39;s far more willing to watch a mediocre movie than the <br/>
rest of us - if we don&#39;t really like a movie, we find something else to <br/>
do - he sticks with it until the end. He&#39;s far far less picky.<br/>
<br/>
My husband probably watches 10 to 20 times more tv than the other 4 of <br/>
us put together.<br/>
He had no tv until he was 11 or 12 years old. Then he had just a little <br/>
black and white tv - he never SAW a color tv until he came to this <br/>
country at about 23 years old. He loves it. We have a big-screen tv in <br/>
the living room. He turns it on just to see what&#39;s on. My kids NEVER <br/>
turn it on just because they feel like watching tv - they turn it on to <br/>
watch a specific show and they turn it off when they&#39;re done watching <br/>
that show.<br/>
<br/>
I think back to the times we watched Sesame Street and Mr. Rogers and a <br/>
lot of PBS children&#39;s shows like Under the Umbrella Tree and The Puzzle <br/>
Place and Wishbone, etc., with great waves of nostalgia. Those were <br/>
some WONDERFUL tv shows that my children and my husband and I shared. <br/>
Great memories that we now share! But those memories are mixed in, too, <br/>
with extensive memories of them pretending that they were dolphins in <br/>
the swimming pool and making sandcastles at the beach and playing with <br/>
playdough on the patio and with fingerpaints in the bathtub and on and <br/>
on.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My children have learned to become hypercritical of commercials.  <br/>
Partly because they have found that the ads on tv don&#39;t live up to <br/>
their claims.  (Have any of your kids tried to make their Hotwheels <br/>
do like they do on television?!?!)  Same with foods.  Easy Mac was a <br/>
major disappointment for my kids.  It tasted gross and had a really <br/>
weird texture to it.  So now they could care less about the <br/>
commercials.  (Although I did have to purchase a bottle of Ka-Boom <br/>
once to make Keon happy and surprisingly it did what it said it <br/>
would on tv.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read many of these studies on television and brain <br/>
development.  There are problems with the studies because they <br/>
really can&#39;t do a fair control group.  Behavioural studies always <br/>
have flaws in them.  I&#39;m not supporting the television industry, <br/>
just pointing out the flaw in their studies.  I would LOVE it if my <br/>
kids didn&#39;t watch television.  I could care less about tv and could <br/>
really live without one (just don&#39;t take away my radio and internet <br/>
LOL!)  That isn&#39;t going to happen, but what I do know is that my <br/>
kids don&#39;t watch that much television anymore.  Yesterday it didn&#39;t <br/>
come on until mom (that would be me) showed up at home with a copy <br/>
of the Incredibles DVD.  We then sat for 2 hours watching the bonus <br/>
features.  (OK so maybe I want a television and a DVD player in my <br/>
perfect world.)  <br/>

to shine his pennies in his piggy bank. That led to testing out all <br/>
sorts of (safe) household stuff - vinegar, lemon juice, baking <br/>
soda/vinegar mix, etc. to see what would shine pennies. End result: <br/>
nothing was quite as easy and shiny as the Ka-Boom looked to be. So <br/>

&gt; LOL Ka-Boom was the instigator for some major &quot;scientific <br/>

 </span></blockquote>So <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; we may end up with some too. Glad to hear it actually works as <br/>
&gt; advertised.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve never thought of using it to shine pennies (we are avid penny <br/>
pressers and like to shine our pennies before we go to Disney <br/>
World.)  Maybe we will have to go try this.  We usually use either <br/>
vinegar and baking soda or catsup.  Yep, just a bit of catsup.  <br/>
Leave the pennies in it for several hours. Come back and rinse and <br/>
you will have shiny pennies.<br/>

I think the commercial for Ka-Boom that DS saw showed the guy <br/>
dipping a penny halfway into a little bowl of the solution and when <br/>
it came out, the dipped part was shiny.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Um, you missed that episode of Mythbusters :-)  This is truly a <br/>
rumor.  We did this in high school chemistry.  We put 3 nails in 3 <br/>
different beakers.  One had nothing in it.  One had water.  The <br/>
third had Coca-cola.  We left them for one week.  The nail in the <br/>
empty glass was the same as the day we put it in there.  The nails <br/>
in the other two glasses were slightly rusted (we actually had to <br/>
collect the rust particles and weigh them for our class - it was <br/>
truly fun!) But the rate of deteriation was the same.  Snopes <br/>
explaines it well:<br/>
