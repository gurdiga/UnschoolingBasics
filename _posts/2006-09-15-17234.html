<div id="ygrps-yiv-540664449">Hi all.  Im Denise and live in Holland, MI with dh, Mike, dd, Sienna (6),<br/>
and ds, Nicholas (4).  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I love the idea of unschooling, but have to first learn how to deschool<br/>
myself.  Im always fighting that feeling of we should be doing  I just<br/>
read an article in Live Free Learn Free (Nov/Dec05) that suggested<br/>
forgetting about what you are NOT doing and focusing instead on what you ARE<br/>
doingthis is really helpful to me.  Also knowing that everyday isnt going<br/>
to be a perfect day!  Plus I need to get over the what will other people<br/>
think? (ie, grandparents, neighbors, etc.)  I always have this panicky<br/>
feeling when my 6-yo dd says to me Im going out to play mom at 9 in the<br/>
morning (but shouldnt we do school first I think?)  Why?  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Okay, more about me and my family.  Ive been a LLL Leader for 3 ½ years and<br/>
am a certified birth doula (although Im not actively attending births).  I<br/>
love to knit and go for nature hikes.  My son loves playing with water and<br/>
dirt and doing exactly the opposite of what you ask him to do.  My daughter<br/>
is into ballet and loves doing artwork.  Together their favorite pastime is<br/>
arguing with each (Im an only child so this whole sibling thing is quite<br/>
baffling to me).  My hubby enjoys riding his recumbent bike, messing around<br/>
with electronics, and playing guitar.  As a family, we love to ride our<br/>
tandem bikes to local parks, walk to the beach for breakfast (we live about<br/>
a ¼ mile from Lk Mich), and we just got a piano and are using the Stewart<br/>
Method to learn piano together at home.  Were also huge fans of<br/>
Kindermusik, both my kids just LOVE going and one of my co-leaders<br/>
own/operates Kindermusik of Hollandcant say enough about it.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Lastly, I am trying to breath life into an online support group for west<br/>
Michigan called West Michigan Eclectic Homeschoolers.  There is a huge<br/>
homeschooling population in W Mich, but the vast majority, imo, belong to<br/>
the CRC and homeschool strictly for religious purposes.  It seems most are<br/>
very curriculum centered.  This online group Ive started is an inclusive<br/>
group and Im hoping to attract various flavors of unschoolers from the<br/>
area.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Glad to be a part of this group.  Looking forward to learning more about how<br/>
others turn everyday experiences into learning opportunities.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Looking forward to learning more about how others turn everyday experiences into learning opportunities.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s the beauty of unschooling, everyday experiences *are* learning experiences! You don&#39;t have to work at that part. <br/>
<br/>
If kids are looking, touching, reading, smelling, messing with, tasting, listening, feeling, thinking, writing, drawing, pondering or questioning-they&#39;re learning. Our job is to keep strewing their path with more and more opportunities to check out new things, ideas, places, tastes, people, sounds, etc. and to facilitate their exploration and understanding of the world. <br/>
<br/>
The one thing we should try to avoid, IMO, is the temptation to turn fun or playful activities boring or undesirable by trying for &quot;learning opportunities&quot;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hello Denise,<br/>
<br/>
  My name is Rebecca and I am also new to this group and so far I am <br/>
loving all the information I am gleaning.  Unfortunately, this week <br/>
I attempted to have my son go to headstart (against my own instinct <br/>
because I felt obligated, since I signed him up a year ago...) <br/>
Anyway I had him get on the bus the first 2 days but by the third <br/>
day when he truly did not want to go -- I didn&#39;t force it.  And if I <br/>
had to do it over I wouldn&#39;t not have even did it the first day.  <br/>
Anyway, lesson learned and now I&#39;m delving totally whole heartly <br/>
into this whole unschooling thought.   <br/>
<br/>
   Now, I am from Clio MI just north of Flint and so far have not <br/>
quite found a good Homeschooling group.  but your support group <br/>
sounded great -- think you could let me in???  I will see if I can <br/>
find you .. and ask there too... anyway I am glad to hear from one <br/>
more Michigander.  I have a friend (from Pontiac, MI) who has <br/>
homeschooled/unschooled her child since lastly was young and now she <br/>
is 13 and I think she is one of the most unique, loving, amazing <br/>
girl I have ever met.  So even though I just got a degree in <br/>
Elementary education,  I&#39;m pretty much going to say to heck with the <br/>
traditional.... <br/>
<br/>
OK, OK I realize i&#39;m babbling...<br/>
