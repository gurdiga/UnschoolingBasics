Does anyone have direct experience with unschooling (in the military<br/>
particularly) in Italy? I am of course going to search the net but would<br/>
like to know if someone has first hand experience. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

un/homeschooling groups?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have any experience with Italy, in particular, but we did <br/>
live in Germany and Turkey as a military family.  If there&#39;s <br/>
anything you want to ask, just ask :)<br/>

I have first hand experience in Greece.  There are only a handful of<br/>
families here that are homeschooling and even fewer unschooling.  I think<br/>
youÂ¹ll find that there are lots of homeschooling families in Italy, and<br/>
people will have at least heard of it ;)<br/>
<br/>
Still, there may be some similarities between the two countries.  Please<br/>
feel free to contact me privately if you need some support.<br/>
<br/>
When are you moving?<br/>
