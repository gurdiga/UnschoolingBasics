This is just SO wonderful to hear from a mom!  I hear too many moms <br/>
complaining about everything their child does (not here of course!).  But her unique <br/>
style would send most parents over the edge.   My oldest son was that way, kids <br/>
at school said he was so different and had his own style, and like you, I felt <br/>
he was the greatest person I&#39;d ever known!<br/>
syndi<br/>
<br/>
&quot;...since we can&#39;t know what knowledge will be most needed in the future, it <br/>
is senseless to try to teach it in advance. Instead, we should try to turn out <br/>
people who love learning so much and learn so well that they will be able to <br/>
learn whatever needs to be learned.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-804955772">Other kids do pick on her at school for her &quot;look&quot; and I have had more than<br/>
one parent make a sly remark.  They are afraid that it&#39;s a bad influence on<br/>
their children.  They&#39;ve told their kids right in front of me; &quot;don&#39;t think<br/>
your doing that&quot;. Like it&#39;s some kind of bad disease to be an individual.<br/>
What are these parents so uptight about.  My kid is an A student, never in<br/>
trouble, caring, thoughtful and most importantly a centered all around good<br/>
person.  OOOh don&#39;t let your kid hand around with that! Jeesh it might ware<br/>
off.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-451657167">She wants to be a fashion designer or an artist.  She&#39;s tried her hand<br/>
at photography, but always goes back to designing clothes.  It&#39;s funny<br/>
because she doesn&#39;t want to sew the clothes just design them and pay people<br/>
to sew them for her.  Everything, anything seems possible to her and you<br/>
know what? it is!<br/>
