<div id="ygrps-yiv-120928986">Besides the basic splashing in puddles we set up the Slip &#39;n Slide. No <br/>
need to use the hose and the looks the neighbors give us are priceless!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone who gave me Blog advice. I&#39;ll eventually get around <br/>
to starting one!<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy the rain!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2117322333">We did the same today. The kids put on their bathing suits and went to town in the mud puddle out front as well as the wading pool in the backyard, and just playing in the yard :-) <br/>
