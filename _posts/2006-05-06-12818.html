<br/>
I use my blog for that and we also like to make scrapbooks or things <br/>
we&#39;ve done or places we&#39;ve gone. Are you keeping track for the state <br/>
or just for yourself? We do it just for fun. It&#39;s kinda nice to <br/>
revisit stuff we&#39;ve done. :-)<br/>

Just read your blog.  My dh is a carnivorous plant expert, so if you <br/>
have any questions about your venus flytrap or any other plants, let me <br/>
know.  We have a raised bog in our backyard with all kinds of flytraps, <br/>
pitcher plants and other carnivorous plants in it.  My dh started back <br/>
in high school.  I think there&#39;s a discussion list on them somewhere too.<br/>
<br/>
Make sure you put your flytrap is in peat moss and not soil, and don&#39;t <br/>
keep the lid on it or you&#39;ll fry your plant.<br/>

Where do you live?   We&#39;d love to see your bog!  We live next to <br/>
wetlands, but don&#39;t know if they&#39;re agreeable.  My dd has recently <br/>
become interested in carnivorous plants and wants to grow some.   <br/>
We&#39;re in MA and we found a place in western part of the state that has <br/>
native pitcher plants (haven&#39;t been there yet).   We also have &quot;The <br/>
Savage Garden&quot; and have been looking at the author&#39;s website (he&#39;s in <br/>
CA and sells the plants).   We had a venus fly trap several years ago <br/>
and probably killed it, not realizing they go dormant in the winter <br/>
(oops).  We want to do it right this time!  I&#39;d appreciate any <br/>
suggestions (you can email me off list if you prefer).  Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-852906149">Thanks Joanne and Malinda.  Blogging feels overwhelming to me so I will<br/>
continue on the journaling path for now (I checked out your blog Malinda,<br/>
and that looks so neat and tiddy, I love it).  I&#39;m doing it for us first<br/>
off, but I am planning on enrolling us in a charter next year.  They are<br/>
fairly lax about keeping track and don&#39;t care how I do it, but I will have<br/>
to do it daily so I am &quot;practicing&quot;, trying to get something down everyday<br/>
to see how it feels.  On the whole, I have been journaling at least once a<br/>
week about everything we do and my thoughts etc.but not &quot;keeping track&quot; of<br/>
what&#39;s getting learned.  I keep a Franklin Covey day planner, and since<br/>
things happen throughout the day (and when we&#39;re out and about) I know I<br/>
will always have it with me, and would be a good choice.  I don&#39;t think I<br/>
will remember at the end of the day all that went on.Anyhow, your ideas<br/>
helped me to see how other unschoolers do it.  Thanks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1047426630">Thanks, Kristie!<br/>
<br/>
I probably put in my blog that we mixed the &quot;soil&quot;...but we actually used a 1:1 ratio of peat moss to pearlite, as that seemed to be the consensus we found online.  Does that sound about right?  The flytrap was potted in soil with a bunch of sphagnum moss, and I&#39;m afraid we might have damaged a few of it&#39;s roots trying to get it out of the moss (we had read that the sphagnum moss would actually rot the roots).  I appreciate the tip on keeping the lid off!  Just what I need is to fry the poor thing.  I seem to kill every plant I come in contact with, but plants under Tristan&#39;s care just flourish! LOL  Right now it&#39;s inside on a fairly sunny ledge since it is still too cold to have it outside.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>

Best of luck with any carnivorous plants you get!  Tristan was so excited to find his Venus&#39; Flytrap and is now on the lookout for another one (they are very hard to find where we are) and also a pitcher plant.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1503536263">Hi Ladies,<br/>
<br/>
We live in Virginia (near Va. Beach).  My dh has been growing <br/>
carnivorous plants for over 30 years.  I&#39;ve forwarded your posts to him <br/>
for advice.  I&#39;ll email you privately with some info on growing plants <br/>
in your areas.<br/>
<br/>
In Alaska, you can grow some northern pitcher plants outside.  I&#39;m not <br/>
sure what zone you&#39;re in, but you may need to keep your flytraps <br/>
inside.  They are native to North Carolina, so they need a pretty warm <br/>
climate.<br/>
<br/>
I know I&#39;ve got some pictures of his plants on my computer somewhere, so <br/>
when I find them I&#39;ll upload them and post the link.<br/>

My husband spent almost a year at Langley AFB after 9/11 (he was in <br/>
the Air National Guard and got activated from MA to Langley) and dd <br/>
and I visited while he was there, so we saw a little of the area, <br/>
including Va Beach.  We were just in VA over Easter visiting my BIL <br/>
and family (Fairfax Station, VA).  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for passing my post on to dh - I know we can grow the flytrap <br/>
inside, but would eventally like to try to grow some outside if <br/>
possible. I look forward to hearing from you (no rush! we&#39;re still <br/>
reading the book)<br/>

Hi, I&#39;m wondering for those who do keep track of what you do throughout <br/>
your<br/>
days when you do it?  Do you tend to jot things down as they happen or <br/>
do<br/>
you wait and recap the day at the end of it?  I&#39;m just wondering how <br/>
others<br/>
have incorporated this into their flow of the day.  I&#39;m just starting to<br/>
keep track, and my son is 6...I&#39;m starting with the Recordkeeping for<br/>
Unschoolers file.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
In SC, we&#39;re required to document.<br/>
<br/>
We do a bit of everything you mentioned plus others.<br/>
<br/>
I have a daytimer. I write down what we plan to do. What we actually <br/>
did. Any special &quot;landmarks&#39; (revelations, etc). I keep brochures, <br/>
ticket stubs, art projects, photos, etc. in a plastic container near <br/>
the back door. Once a year (June---techically, our school year ends <br/>
each June), I&#39;ll collect all the things. We scrapbook---kind of like a <br/>
yearbook.<br/>
<br/>
I do NOT let it interfere with our day. Some days I do nothing (even <br/>
though plenty&#39;s happening here). When we&#39;re travelling, I can easily <br/>
look back and remember what/when/where.<br/>
<br/>
Remember that most states that require documentation demand only 180 <br/>
days/year. You don&#39;t have to document every single day!<br/>
