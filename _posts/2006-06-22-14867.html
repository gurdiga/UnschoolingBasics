<div id="ygrps-yiv-511496069">Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re very new to HS - started at the beginning of this yr. I have 4<br/>
boys, 3 of which I am hs. The eldest is 20 & at university having gone<br/>
through the &#39;normal&#39; school route. the others are 15, 12 & 9<br/>
I have very quickly discovered how differently they  all learn - the<br/>
older of the 3 is doing Cambridge distance learning & is doing extremely<br/>
well, despite being very &#39;lazy&#39;.<br/>
My 12yr old loves stucture &  flounders somewhat if he doesn&#39;t have his<br/>
schoolday mapped out for him.<br/>
The 9yr old is where the unschooling comes in - he hated all 3 yrs he<br/>
spent at school & was one of the main reasons we decided to hs.<br/>
So we started off the year with all the books & curriculae, & as I said<br/>
the older two are geeting along fine with that, but this little one,<br/>
hates having to write, battles to get thoughts onto paper, but verbalise<br/>
them beautifully. We&#39;ve had a whole bunch of tests done & picked up some<br/>
&#39;problems&#39;, that if he was at school would be labeled, so it&#39;s just as<br/>
well we decided to hs.<br/>
Anyway I&#39;m rambling - sorry.<br/>
How do I go about unschooling when I have 2 others who are not ?? As<br/>
each week goes by I am more & more certain that this is the way to go<br/>
for him, but, after having kids in the school sytem for 14yrs I still<br/>
battle to &#39;let go&#39;. Does this get easier as time goes on - bearing in<br/>
mind I&#39;m in South Africa which still has a very small hs community(but<br/>
growing all the time) & an even smaller unschooling one ???<br/>
So many questions - so little time!! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Regards<br/>
Anne<br/>

unschool one all need to be free to unschool.  Your son who needs his<br/>
day mapped out for him may need so because of his fear of not doing<br/>
school because that is all he knows.  Deschooling everyone is a huge<br/>
priority!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would unschool all 3 of them! If the older two want to do long distance programs or some curriculum work that&#39;s fine. But I would make it their choice to do so.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have very quickly discovered how differently they  all learn<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s helpful to realize that the older ones, and to some extent the  <br/>
younger one, may not be showing you their natural learning styles but  <br/>
what style they&#39;ve adopted to survive the forced learning of school.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t just adults that get stuck in believing school style  <br/>
learning is the only way to learn. Accepting that others know more  <br/>
about what you need is one coping strategy for people stuck in a  <br/>
situation they can&#39;t escape from. They basically *have* to believe  <br/>
all the hard work and pain are worth it or they&#39;ve been torturing  <br/>
themselves for nothing :-/<br/>
<br/>
If someone climbs Mt Everest, it feels like a great accomplishment  <br/>
because there isn&#39;t another way to get to the top without a lot of  <br/>
trials and tribulations.<br/>
<br/>
If someone expends a great deal of effort climbing the side of a  <br/>
mountain only to get to the top and find there&#39;s a gentle path that  <br/>
would have taken them to the same spot their emotions are going to be  <br/>
in turmoil because their goal has been the peak and the only path  <br/>
(supposedly!) to it. The gentle path seems like a cheat and they can  <br/>
feel angry towards those using it. They can justify to themselves  <br/>
that their climb provided more exercise.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, if they *know* there&#39;s a gentle path and choose to  <br/>
go up the steep side, then the effort isn&#39;t about reaching the top  <br/>
but the journey getting there.<br/>
<br/>
Just something to think about.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; - the<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s also helpful not to see a child as lazy. As someone succinctly  <br/>
put it just last week, lazy is when someone isn&#39;t doing what someone  <br/>
else believes they should and judging a child&#39;s use of time by the  <br/>
parent&#39;s standards doesn&#39;t help a parent help their child unschool.  <br/>
With unschooling there is no learning they &quot;should&quot; be doing.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s odd that in school kids who get A&#39;s easily are more admired than  <br/>
kids who study hard and get C&#39;s. Being born with an ability to absorb  <br/>
information easily in a school environment shouldn&#39;t be any more  <br/>
worthy of admiration and praise than being born with naturally silken  <br/>
hair. It&#39;s just darn *convenient* for the child if they&#39;re stuck in  <br/>
school. But finding it easy isn&#39;t a choice they&#39;ve made.<br/>
<br/>
Not having an affinity for school style learning, and not being able  <br/>
to stuff down the feelings that there are far better uses of  <br/>
someone&#39;s time shouldn&#39;t be seen as lazy. I&#39;d say he&#39;s stuck between  <br/>
the belief that school style learning is necessary and superior and  <br/>
the knowledge that it just doesn&#39;t interest him. Is ignoring the  <br/>
internal voice that&#39;s telling him he&#39;s wasting his time that could be  <br/>
put to better uses something to strive for?<br/>
<br/>
Just something else to think about.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My 12yr old loves stucture &  flounders somewhat if he doesn&#39;t have  <br/>
&gt; his<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lots of unschooled kids like to have some structure to their *days*.  <br/>
They like knowing what&#39;s coming up.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of kids get stuck on the idea that they  have to do school. And  <br/>
since there are thousands of things that are a lot more fun, one  <br/>
strategy to get through what they have to do is to have a specific  <br/>
schedule.<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s hard to say if he naturally craves days that are predictable  <br/>
or if he&#39;s stuck on the idea that he needs to do this school work.<br/>
<br/>
How is he during the summer? Does he do well with unstructured days  <br/>
or does he like having plans and knowing about them ahead of time?<br/>
<br/>
There isn&#39;t a way to make the others unschool, but it&#39;s easy enough  <br/>
to leave the door open for them so they can come in if they&#39;d like :-)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, perfectly natural to have problems letting go. As I suggested  <br/>
above, we *need* to believe all those dull tortorous hours in school  <br/>
*had* to have some benefit or we wasted them all. Our brains cope by  <br/>
convincing us that there&#39;s a lot we don&#39;t understand about learning  <br/>
so we should just accept the idea that experts know better and do  <br/>
what they suggest.<br/>
<br/>
It does get  easier. It helps a lot to read about unschooling so you  <br/>
know what natural learning looks like. (It looks a lot like play!)<br/>
