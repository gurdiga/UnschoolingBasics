<div id="ygrps-yiv-1201809394">...to a coworker and wants me to provide the family with some <br/>
resources and info.  I was hoping someone on this board could help me:<br/>
<br/>
They are a family of 5 with a SAHM.  Apparently, 2 younger daughters <br/>
have no trouble with school, but they have a 12 year old boy <br/>
diagnosed with ADD (or ADHD?) and learning disabilities.  He is being <br/>
bullied on top of that.  My husband Larry told the Dad about <br/>
unschooling and then asked me to send this guy&#39;s wife (whom I have <br/>
never met) some info.  I have no idea where they are on the parenting <br/>
spectrum, so it&#39;s hard, kwim?  I have no idea how they&#39;d react to <br/>
deschooling, for example, and if they are capable of giving their son <br/>
freedom to do so...<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, does anyone have some general resources on removing a kid <br/>
like this from school and helping him recover from this experience?  <br/>
Specific books to recommend or websites.  We live in North Carolina, <br/>
if it matters...<br/>
<br/>
My kids are young and &quot;pre&quot; school-age and we obviously have no <br/>
experience with learning disabilities and ADD diagnoses, so I hope <br/>
someone who does may be able to help!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
