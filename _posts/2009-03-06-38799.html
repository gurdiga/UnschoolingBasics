<div id="ygrps-yiv-345396228">Hey,<br/>
<br/>
This is a quick SOS and an exciting one!  My husband has embraced unschooling over the past couple of years, which is great, but has been resistant to the non-academic side of things.  After some conflict today he finally agreed to read the stuff about chores on Sandra Dodd&#39;s website and Joyce Fetteroll&#39;s.  His response?  &quot;It&#39;s bloody good stuff!&quot;  But it&#39;s a HUGE mind shift for him, who readily admits to being a neat freak.  However, his mind is quite open to it right now and he&#39;s asked if there are any unschooling message boards for Dads, and/or perhaps some unschooling Dad&#39;s blogs? <br/>
<br/>
I can just direct him here, but I think there&#39;s something about hearing it from a bloke that is appealing to him (and most guys I imagine).<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone point me in the right direction, asap, before the open door potentially closes?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Try this one. Ben started it. Most of the dads have been to a conference, so they have proof or have seen proof. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not terribly busy, but he could change that by asking a few questions. Several dads respond every time there&#39;s a question posted. They are very, very supportive of unschooling!<br/>

Jeff Sabo&#39;s blog is great, but I think he&#39;s backed off to spend more time with his boys. Jeff?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1204973536">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m an unschooling Dad and have a blog as well; so I suppose I fit the bill.<br/>
We&#39;re tough to find but every now and then...<br/>
<br/>
My blog is somewhat of a fledgling project which is just now beginning to<br/>
paint a picture of how we learn and approach learning. <br/>
<br/>
My wife has the &quot;real job&quot;. I&#39;m the primary &quot;stay at home care taker&quot; and<br/>
the initiating force behind the decision to learn at home.  But I must say<br/>
that unschooling can really be quite different than home school in that we<br/>
become facilitators rather than teachers and suddenly these typical rolls<br/>
fall away and become rather irrelevant.  We just live and learn together in<br/>
one big swish.<br/>
