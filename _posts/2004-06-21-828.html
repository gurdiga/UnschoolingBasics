OH OH --  I have a book for you.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Thinking Physics&quot; -- here is something from the  back cover:<br/>

Thanks Pam!  What a great sounding book.  Admittedly, not a  physics-head <br/>
myself, I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll both get something from it.  I&#39;m off to  find it right now.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks, too, for taking the time to explain your thoughts on the physics  <br/>
learning process.  I also just read a quote similar to the one you sited,  <br/>
(paraphrasing)  &#39;In school we learn the lesson and then take the  test.  In life we <br/>
take the test and then learn the lesson.&#39;<br/>
