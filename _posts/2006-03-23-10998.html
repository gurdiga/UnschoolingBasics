<div id="ygrps-yiv-373208822">&quot; Don&#39;t forget, there are some wonderful<br/>
videos to help with learning about history, science, all sorts of<br/>
stuff.  Even literature -- find the movie, discuss it, maybe read the<br/>
book afterwards so he gains greater understanding of what the author<br/>
was doing, after already familiar with the story.  Or not, you need<br/>
to evaluate what will work best for you two.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is a list designed to help people move towards UNschooling. Not<br/>
sugar coating lessons to get kids interested in things, not dabbling<br/>
about with several homeschooling methods....but UNschooling.<br/>
<br/>
We are here to tell you that children will learn from playing video<br/>
games, daydreaming, building with legos or anything else they love to<br/>
do!  We are here to tell you that trusting your child is the BEST way<br/>
to help them learn. We are here to tell you that learning happens all<br/>
the time, just like breathing.<br/>
<br/>
If you aren&#39;t an unschooler, and don&#39;t plan on being one, please read<br/>
the list guidelines carefully and try to remember the purpose for<br/>
which this list was begun.<br/>
<br/>
I am a radical unschooler. I started this list with another radical<br/>
unschooler that runs the Live and Learn conferences. Our moderators<br/>
are radical unschoolers and while all the folks here are not radical<br/>
unschoolers, that&#39;s the kind of advice this list is here to dispense<br/>
and assist folks with.  Thanks.<br/>
