<div id="ygrps-yiv-1726925323">I just want to say thank you for all of you who have taken the time to<br/>
answer my questions.  I think after reading the last few answers that, as I<br/>
said in my last e-mail, my family is just too different philosophically from<br/>
the views on the list, so I think it is time for me to hit that unsubscribe<br/>
button.  And please don&#39;t misunderstand me - I&#39;m not mad or upset or<br/>
anything; I just think it would be in my best interest to leave and<br/>
therefore not waste any more of your time (or mine, lol).  But, I am<br/>
thankful for the time I was on this list and am again appreciative of your<br/>
help and I wish you well.  <br/>

If you change your mind in a few weeks or months, we&#39;ll still be here.<br/>
<br/>
Seriously---ideas change when we start *really* thinking about things. <br/>
We can&#39;t help it! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We *know* we make people uncomfortable. Change is uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck on your journey.<br/>

  &quot;The hardest problem for the brain is not learning, but forgetting. No <br/>
matter how hard we try, we can&#39;t deliberately forget something we have <br/>
learned, and that is catastrophic if we learn that we can&#39;t learn.&quot;  <br/>
