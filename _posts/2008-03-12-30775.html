  You have misinterpreted my earlier posts about body language and eye contact to be about intimidation. I have to blame myself for that because of my lack of proper communication skills. When I suggested it, I meant to do it in the same way you&#39;d do it to fend off any attacker since the original poster in that thread was describing getting attacked by her children. I often see many of you here give the example of not letting your children do things that you wouldn&#39;t let strangers do. I do not think that is anti-unschooly. Again, I apologize about my poor communication skills, since I do not advocate the use of force and intimidation.<br/>
   <br/>
  I have a 7 year old daughter that has been in school from 2 years old til now, and I have an 11 month old boy. I have just begun my unschooling lifestyle. I did not know unschooling existed until 3 months ago. I asked several people what unschool meant and got several definitions, I&#39;m still making up my mind precisely what it means. <br/>
   <br/>
  All my life, I&#39;ve never held a strong position on alternative teaching methods. I was aware that homeschooling existed but never thought it feasible since I was taught you had to be state certified to homeschool. I was recently made aware that you didn&#39;t have to be and I began to research my options and this is where I&#39;m strongly leaning. I like these yahoo groups, I&#39;m learning quite a bit. So thank you all for being here.<br/>

  =========<br/>
<br/>
In a natural state a human lives with other humans. Humans are naturally social animals. Most apes are social animals. Even Orangutangs are being found to be much more social than previously thought. Humans have been social since long before they were humans. Whatever natural state you are referring to isn&#39;t a normal state for a human to find himself or herself in. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The purpose of words -- especially on a discussion list -- is to get  <br/>
the ideas in your head into someone else&#39;s with as little loss as  <br/>
possible. If you find the words you&#39;re using to convey a thought  <br/>
aren&#39;t carrying the thought as clearly as you want,  it&#39;s easier,  <br/>
wastes less time, to change your words than to get a whole list of  <br/>
people to agree to a new definition of the words you want to use.<br/>
<br/>
Because coerce to most people means to force, it just isn&#39;t going to  <br/>
be a useful word to describe a process that avoids forcing ideas on  <br/>
another. While my daughter has certainly absorbed a lot of our social  <br/>
behaviors, I haven&#39;t made my choices the only choices. She&#39;s free to  <br/>
try things out. I&#39;m free to suggest, that might not be as good as  <br/>
this other idea. Through that process, she&#39;s certainly surpassed me  <br/>
in social skills!<br/>
<br/>
While there are similarities between modeling and coercing, places  <br/>
where the sets of behaviors overlap, the differences are more  <br/>
important when you&#39;re trying to find ways to help and not impose.  <br/>
It&#39;s useful to examine the parts where they overlap, certainly but  <br/>
when trying to help someone move away from conventionally coercive  <br/>
methods, it&#39;s way more useful to see how helping differs so they can  <br/>
make better choices.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;ve stated before, civility is not natural but neither is un- <br/>
&gt; civility.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think they&#39;re both natural. At least the desires to be social or  <br/>
selfish are. How we go about fulfilling those desires, the techniques  <br/>
we use, are absorbed by living with others. The innate desire is  <br/>
there. And children pick up how to social (and selfish) by watching  <br/>
us and others and trying various things out and being helped.<br/>
<br/>
My theory about social and selfishness -- though I doubt that it&#39;s  <br/>
new -- is that we have the selfish, &quot;keep ourselves alive long enough  <br/>
to reproduce&quot; drives of our reptilian (and further back) ancestors.  <br/>
Overlaid on that is the &quot;come together and cooperate to survive&quot; of  <br/>
our ape (and further back) ancestors. Both drives are perfectly  <br/>
natural, but also conflict with each other. (I suspect that&#39;s where  <br/>
the concept that man is inherently evil comes from. But it&#39;s not evil  <br/>
to be selfish. Just reptilian ;-) And since the selfish drives are  <br/>
way older, way more streamlined, they do come more naturally. But  <br/>
when basic needs are met, it&#39;s way more useful to cooperate and that  <br/>
natural drive is in us. Being social is not merely an idea overlaid  <br/>
by society. It&#39;s a real chemically driven need to be together.<br/>

<br/>
In my opinion, leading by example is perhaps<br/>
unintended coercion since it will most likely lead to &lt;creating&gt; a <br/>
behaviour in<br/>
the subject.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
But again, the behavior &quot;created&quot; may not be the intended behavior <br/>
&quot;taught.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a *reason* the phrase &quot;Do what I say, not what I do&quot; exists. <br/>
&lt;g&gt; Often, the behavior modeled is NOT the intended lesson.<br/>
<br/>
Smacking a child for hitting his sister because &quot;hitting isn&#39;t nice&quot; <br/>
and &quot;we don&#39;t hit!&quot; doesn&#39;t really make the point the parent was trying <br/>
to make. Just the opposite, in fact.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-===-<br/>
<br/>
I admit, when using the black and white dictionary definition of<br/>
coerce, it would sound as if I&#39;m suggesting using force and/or <br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Uhhh---can there be another definition of coerce? &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
As I&#39;ve stated before, civility is not natural<br/>
but neither is un-civility.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t agree. In a society (and we&#39;re social animals!), how can <br/>
civility NOT be a natural state?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
In a natural state a human simply survives, no<br/>

What un-natural state are you living in? &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I think it&#39;s VERY natural to want to have those around you in a happy <br/>

   You have misinterpreted my earlier posts about body language and eye <br/>

to be about intimidation. I have to blame myself for that because of my <br/>

<br/>
I can stop my kids with a look. I can probably stop *you* with a look <br/>
too. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We are among many animals who &quot;read&quot; others&#39; eyes to communicate. Good <br/>
magicians make a LIVING doing just that! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

I often see many of you<br/>
here give the example of not letting your children do things that you <br/>

let strangers do. I do not think that is anti-unschooly.<br/>

<br/>
Right.<br/>

<br/>
OP here....Morgan&#39;s early life was ANYTHING but natural.  She had one<br/>
of the most artificial and contrived rearing situations on Earth.<br/>
Loved and nutured until 4 weeks of age, then left in a park at night<br/>
with a note pinned to her chest.  Brought to the Social Welfare<br/>
Institute and run through a battery of health checks like one might do<br/>
to a foundling calf....then confined to a crib most of the time.  At<br/>
18 months old, she was presented to a family for adoption and they<br/>
rejected her for not being able to sit still at dinner in the dining<br/>
room and not being quiet enough so they could pray.  Additionally she<br/>
would refuse to look at them and she would not kiss and hug them.<br/>
(They had her only 3 days and she had a cold.)  So they returned<br/>
her....with a hole in her heart.  (They had pressured China to keep<br/>
her from having her surgery to be able to do it in California where<br/>
they could pray over her.)  So, because she was ill, and rejected, the<br/>
SWI figured she was unadoptable and was too sick to be allowed the<br/>
minimal play the other kids got.  So she was tied flat on her back<br/>
into the crib and she stayed there for 5 months.  No baths, no sitting<br/>
up, no toys, but bedsores aplenty.  The only contact she got was to be<br/>
fed and changed and that was either by the person who abused her or<br/>
someone else.  When I petitioned the Chinese to be allowed to adopt<br/>
her they did her heart surgery and she went from the SWI to being tied<br/>
into a hospital bed with no pain management after open heart surgery.<br/>
She was there for 8 weeks.  Then returned to the SWI, where they<br/>
attempted to &quot;fix&quot; her autism by letting her play outside for 20<br/>
minutes once a week.<br/>
<br/>
Morgan would have attempted to make someone happy or unhappy if she<br/>
had the slightest inkling that she had some control over the world but<br/>
the world was something that happened TO her.  This is not natural not<br/>
by a long shot.  Now that she&#39;s here, she expresses her displeasure,<br/>
and happiness.  The day she cried when she hit her head on the table<br/>
was one of the happiest of my life.  That meant she felt something and<br/>
expressed it....because she knew someone was listening!  Before that,<br/>
nothing that happened to her made her express any emotion.  She was<br/>
numb.  I was pleased because I hadn&#39;t expected her to drop her<br/>
defenses this quickly.<br/>
<br/>
FWIW, I have continued to cheer her accomplishments.  Things she tries<br/>
to do, and does *properly* (meaning successfully like getting food on<br/>
a spoon and into her mouth...one of her biggest challenges) I say<br/>
&quot;Good Job!&quot;  because that&#39;s what she wants me to say.  If she tries<br/>
and fails she says &quot;uh-oh!&quot; then tries again after announcing &quot;nother<br/>
one&quot; meaning she will try again.  I may be molding her behavior with<br/>
these displays of praise but for now, this is what she seems to want<br/>
and need.  I am following her lead.  She will ask me to &quot;do dat?&quot; if<br/>
she needs help with something or she will sit and struggle with<br/>
something herself if she wants to do it herself.  But I think she&#39;s a<br/>
pretty happy kid.  There are very few &quot;no&quot;s in her world and a WHOLE<br/>
lot of cheering.  Everything Morgan does is amazing.  and she has<br/>
connected this praise to good feelings because she will cheer for me<br/>
if I do something she thinks is hard.  I think if she was feeling<br/>
pressured by this she wouldn&#39;t do it for me.<br/>

lot of cheering. Everything Morgan does is amazing. and she has<br/>
connected this praise to good feelings because she will cheer for me<br/>
if I do something she thinks is hard. I think if she was feeling<br/>
pressured by this she wouldn&#39;t do it for me.<br/>

<br/>
How do you explain the fact that humans have always &quot;herded&quot; together?<br/>
Waaaayyy before institutionalization. There are always some humans who<br/>
need more and some who need less, but anyone who is truly solitary is<br/>
considered a bit of an aberration. <br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s pretty difficult to come up with any kind of real<br/>
evidence that we are not herd animals. We need other humans in order<br/>
to survive. How many people do you know personally that want a<br/>
completely solitary existence? Wait...you wouldn&#39;t know them because<br/>
they&#39;d be living where you can&#39;t find them.:)<br/>
<br/>
I really wonder where this idea that we aren&#39;t &quot;herding&quot; creatures<br/>
comes from. Nothing in sociology would point to another conclusion as<br/>
far as I can see. <br/>

Which is why for so many &quot;early&quot; or &quot;primitive&quot; cultures (and those<br/>
quotation marks are there on purpose) shunning and exile was the most<br/>
horrific punishment they could dole out.  Better to kill the person<br/>
and have it be over, than for them to be driven out of the group to<br/>
fend for themselves and live alone.  Better to kill or lock up the<br/>
person than to have them live amongst those they called friends and<br/>
family but be invisible to them.  If we were not social creatures,<br/>
these wouldn&#39;t be punishments.  If we were not social creatures,<br/>
solitary folks wouldn&#39;t be seen as, and in fact be such oddities.  I<br/>
don&#39;t think it has any  dependence on institutionalization whatsoever.<br/>
 You&#39;ll have to back that up since all available evidence points to<br/>
the opposite pole.  AND if you happen to believe in evolution as I do,<br/>
we came from monkeys and they are social.  It&#39;s in the genes.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Better than trusting research is employing the powers of personal  <br/>
observation and thought. The above seems to be a rejection of the  <br/>
idea of humans being social creatures because it&#39;s something non- <br/>
nihilists believe. Sort of like a child rejecting all his parents  <br/>
values because he hates his parents.<br/>
<br/>
Zoo keepers know which animals you can cage together and which you  <br/>
can&#39;t and how many and how much personal space each needs. It&#39;s not  <br/>
random. You can&#39;t put as many tigers into a space as you can apes.  <br/>
It&#39;s natural for apes to gather together.<br/>
<br/>
No one could institutionalize people if people didn&#39;t feel some draw  <br/>
towards each other. And the reason they feel a draw is because we&#39;re  <br/>
naturally social creatures. We&#39;re also selfish creatures, but we&#39;re  <br/>
social creatures to.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s automatic that babies left alone in nature  <br/>
will recreate civilization. That&#39;s too complex. And it also doesn&#39;t  <br/>
mean that hitting someone isn&#39;t easier than talking things out.  <br/>
Obviously hitting doesn&#39;t take much higher brain power. But there&#39;s  <br/>
no biological reason humans would have put this much energy into  <br/>
creating social systems from families to civilizations if it weren&#39;t  <br/>
part of our make up to desire to be and work together. Obviously  <br/>
we&#39;ve learned how to make social systems work from our ancestors. The  <br/>
knowledge isn&#39;t inherent or instinctual. But the desire to find ways  <br/>
to pull together is pretty obviously natural by looking at the  <br/>
natural behavior of animals.<br/>

Humans lived in social groups long before they ever created prisons or schools.   Both those institutions were invented to ensure the continued safety of the social group, however ill conceived or misguided some might think those inventions were.    <br/>

I think many people think being social is the act of living out your life near others. Well that ain&#39;t the definition of &lt;social&gt;. Ants would be a better example of truly social animals, but even they tend to only socialize with their own family. Being truly social, one would never seek out refuge from others. I would urge any of you who disagree to find a definition of &lt;social&gt; that allows for such. Ren please consider this as a response to your email also since the question was very similar.<br/>

Do you think that institutions arose in a vacuum? Surely they are just bigger forms of the normal choices for humans? <br/>
<br/>
As a sidenote my husband has collected some of the scientific evidence on herding behavior in humans. But if you believe that it is nurture rather than nature that produces the behavior I guess his work wouldn&#39;t persuade you otherwise?<br/>

 I would posit that the person being driven out would be considered<br/>
&gt; &lt;anti-social&gt; by those driving him out. Most people think simply<br/>
&gt; living your life around other people is &lt;social&gt; but that is not the<br/>
&gt; definition, a truly social animal would not drive another member<br/>

&gt; are social, I posit that they are anti-social and that driving them<br/>
&gt; out would be punishment because they then wouldn&#39;t have other people<br/>
&gt; to prey on and not because they have some sort of genetic need to<br/>
&gt; socialize.<br/>
***********************************<br/>
<br/>
Not all exiles were/are from anti-social behavior, like murder.  In<br/>
some cases taboo breaking caused it and in others due to the religious<br/>
constraints.  Even today in one African tribe (the name escapes me at<br/>
the moment) they have very definite ideas about what are signs from<br/>
G-d.  The birth of twins for example because it&#39;s an oddity, is<br/>
considered a bad omen (they have a word for it) and so the parents<br/>
must abandon one of the twins for the good of the tribe.  If they<br/>
don&#39;t do this, they are driven out for the safety of the tribe.  I<br/>
would posit that the social aspect of this group of people is the<br/>
coming together for safety and shared labor.  You can tell they are<br/>
social because they dance, celebrate and mourn together.  You are<br/>
correct that simply living near another person does not make one<br/>
social, but I would define social behavior as any behavior that<br/>
contributes to the good of the group as a whole.  As another poster<br/>
suggested, the definition of social is up for debate even by people<br/>
for whom this is a life&#39;s work.  But for me, this is my working<br/>
definition.<br/>
<br/>
But in your example, you say driving them out would be punishment<br/>
because the social group doesn&#39;t want them around for the safety of<br/>
the group.  That pretty much defines social to me.  But if you are<br/>
driven out because you got pregnant out of wedlock, you certainly<br/>
aren&#39;t anti-social and driving you out isn&#39;t for the safety of the<br/>
group but to punish you for breaking societal rules and stripping you<br/>
of your safety and social connection.  It is folly to believe that all<br/>
such punishments are visited on the dangerous or mal-adjusted.<br/>
<br/>
Shunning is still in use in Amish communities for breaking the social<br/>
contract where morals are concerned.  The group recognizes the need<br/>
for the individual to remain in the community so instead of exile<br/>
which might lead to the person simply assimilating into the secular<br/>
culture around them, they use shunning to make the point to the<br/>
transgressor and the community at large.<br/>

<br/>
How many kids do you have? How many kids have you helped find meaning  <br/>
in life (have a purpose)? What was the out come? Are they happier?  <br/>
How does it translate to kids of different personalities and  <br/>
temperaments?<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s more useful is practical applications of the philosophies that  <br/>
have been helping parents help their kids. While it&#39;s possible some  <br/>
kids might like to try out a purpose that they&#39;ve been helped to  <br/>
find, how will it help a child who does want to define a purpose? Who  <br/>
is content to not question why they&#39;re here?<br/>
<br/>
What helps kids find their own purpose (or not as they see fit) is to  <br/>
create a safe, nurturing environment, and help them find ways to be  <br/>
comfortable in their own skins while they explore what it means to be  <br/>
themselves.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1042103499">Here&#39;s a definition of &quot;social&quot; that I found online:<br/>
<br/>
social:living together or enjoying life in communities or organized<br/>
groups;<br/>
<br/>
I would venture to say that there would not be cities and communities<br/>
and clubs and all the social texture in our world if humans were not<br/>
driven to be social. How did people decide to build tribes and all the<br/>
structures around them? Because we are naturally driven to be<br/>
connected with other humans. If humans could thrive without other<br/>
humans, we would stay with our parents until weaning and then be on<br/>
our own. <br/>
<br/>
The fact that we also choose non-social activities does not make us<br/>
non-social animals. That&#39;s the most ridiculous thing I&#39;ve heard. Even<br/>
the less social people I know, would be most unhappy without ever<br/>
having other humans to connect with.<br/>
<br/>
Hamsters are a good example of non-social. Once they are weaned and<br/>
start puberty they try to KILL each other. Very much driven towards<br/>
solitude in adult life. We don&#39;t see humans acting like this very<br/>
often. It&#39;s a rare person who does not need/want ANY human contact.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, this has gotten off track from unschooling and will<br/>
not help anyone understand the philosophy, so let&#39;s reign it back in<br/>
please....<br/>
