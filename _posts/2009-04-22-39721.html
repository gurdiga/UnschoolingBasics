<br/>
My daughter loves manga and anime (currently expanding her bookshelf  <br/>
and DVD collection from just Inu-yasha &lt;g&gt;). When she plays either  <br/>
Pokemon DS games or World of Warcraft, she looks up names for her  <br/>
characters in Japanese. She has some DVDs in Japanese only and loves  <br/>
to sing along to Japanese pop songs.<br/>
<br/>
We may have the opportunity to join friends in Japan next year (the  <br/>
older unschoolers are doing a home-stay in Tokyo and we are planning  <br/>
to join their mum for a holiday). This article is giving me some  <br/>
ideas....<br/>
