<div id="ygrps-yiv-1764959238">I&#39;m not sure how well this post will be recieved. I apologize if I offend anyone but I can&#39;t just sit by and not share the information. I wish I had known a long time ago.<br/>
Months ago there were posts about WOW and many parents including myself posted about us or our children/husbands playing this game. My son (12 now) played this game almost every day for 9 months, anywhere from 12-15 hours a day and would have strange episodes when he couldn&#39;t play for one reason or another, sometimes shaking uncontrollably. He chose on his own to stop playing about 3 months ago because these episodes scared him so much. <br/>
The other night my son was cruising YouTube and found some videos claiming that WOW had subliminal messages. We both kind of laughed about it, not really believing it. We went to the part of the game that the video indicated and my son changed some of the sound settings and we heard it. We spent the morning learning about subliminal messaging and why it is illegal. It was very scary. My son is now so upset that he won&#39;t use his own bathroom and barely will leave the room that I&#39;m in. <br/>
I am very angry about this and needed to share it with other parents. I had no problem with him wanting to play a game that he loved-I&#39;m upset that he was manipulated and controlled. <br/>
Again, I apologize if I have offended anyone. That is not my intention at all. <br/>
You can go to YouTube and see the videos for yourselves. I think you would just search world of warcraft subliminal messages. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2112231427">Also, something that we found when learning about subliminal <br/>
messaging is that once the person knows it&#39;s there and it goes from <br/>
the subconcious mind to the consious mind it doesn&#39;t have the same <br/>
effect. I would have no issues if my son chose to play again but I <br/>
feel more comfortable that he knows it&#39;s there and is no longer being <br/>
manipulated.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-858523379">I&#39;ve never played that game, but I have friends who do.  What are the<br/>
subliminal messages saying?  To play WoW all the time? Or something<br/>
more?<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s really disturbing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-498973129">I went and listened and I couldn&#39;t hear anything. We have 3 WoW accounts, so give a fair bit of money, but I try not to die a lot so am not likely to get the messages (the message is in the sounds at the grave, apparently). Anyhow. Simon listened with his eyes closed and heard &quot;Stay with us&quot;. David listened and heard nothing. WoW is engaging and fun and immersive. I don&#39;t know that it is in their interests to risk bringing in the government to shut down their business for using subliminal messages. <br/>

&gt; about us or our children/husbands playing this game. My son (12 now) played<br/>
&gt; this game<br/>
&gt; almost every day for 9 months, anywhere from 12-15 hours a day and would<br/>
&gt; have strange<br/>
&gt; episodes when he couldn&#39;t play for one reason or another, sometimes shaking<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; uncontrollably. He chose on his own to stop playing about 3 months ago<br/>
&gt; because these<br/>
&gt; episodes scared him so much.<br/>
&gt; &gt; The other night my son was cruising YouTube and found some videos<br/>
&gt; claiming that<br/>
&gt; WOW had subliminal messages. We both kind of laughed about it, not really<br/>
&gt; believing it.<br/>
&gt; We went to the part of the game that the video indicated and my son changed<br/>
&gt; some of the<br/>
&gt; sound settings and we heard it. We spent the morning learning about<br/>
&gt; subliminal<br/>
&gt; messaging and why it is illegal. It was very scary. My son is now so upset<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2055043216">I found the videos on youtube. For those of you who don&#39;t play the  <br/>
game you can watch this video:<br/>

<br/>
The sound in the video is what you hear when you die in the game.<br/>
<br/>
I went back and changed all my settings to have the highest quality  <br/>
sound. You can type in this to get the audio to play without actually  <br/>
killing your character:<br/>
<br/>
/script PlaySoundFile(&quot;Sound&#92;&#92;Creature&#92;&#92;SpiritHealer&#92; <br/>
&#92;SpiritHealerLoop.wav&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
And I can hear how it might sound like &quot;play warcraft&quot; and &quot;give us  <br/>
your money&quot; but not definitely. I honestly and sincerely believe that  <br/>
it is a case of power of suggestion and hearing patterns in white  <br/>
noise. Or how you mishear song lyrics. ( the archive of misheard  <br/>
lyrics has some pretty funny examples: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.kissthisguy.com/)">http://www.kissthisguy.com/)</a><br/>

Visual subliminal messages might have a slight influence. If  <br/>
someone&#39;s thirsty a word or two (but no more) can influence someone  <br/>
to choose one brand of drink over another, but had no influence over  <br/>
those who aren&#39;t thirsty.<br/>
<br/>
Audio subliminal messages haven&#39;t shown to be effective.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s much too easy to blame something else for out behavior so we&#39;re  <br/>
primed to want to believe we&#39;re being controled. It lets us off the  <br/>
responsibility hook.<br/>
<br/>
The truth is that WOW is just a whole lot of fun, challenging and  <br/>
very engaging. It *is* hard to tear yourself away from something like  <br/>
that. And not stopping when your body needs you to stop is going to  <br/>
have an effect on it.<br/>

You can&#39;t be manipulated and controlled by subliminal messages. The<br/>
brain isn&#39;t that powerless.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, we give them our money before we ever get an account and the<br/>
game requires that you play it a lot to GET anywhere!! So where&#39;s the<br/>
harm? Sounds like it isn&#39;t worth getting upset about at all.<br/>
<br/>
Looking at it from a purely scientific viewpoint, there are no studies<br/>
that support the idea that subliminal messages can have any kind of<br/>
serious effect on the human mind.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-183630114">ROTFL....sorry, i couldn&#39;t help it.  I read that and thought how funny!  I thought it was <br/>
going to be something dreadful, but that is funny.  I found some sights that had that on <br/>
there too.  I have never once paid attention to that section of WOW.  <br/>
<br/>
It sounds more like he was too young and didn&#39;t understand the game rather than <br/>
something subliminal.  It sounds like a normal response of a child to the game itself.  <br/>
Subliminal suggestion has never been outlawed BTW.  It is in commercials, TV, sometimes <br/>
movies....People don&#39;t realize it because they think it was something the govt voted on <br/>
and made into law, but it never passed....or at least it hadn&#39;t by 2000.  <br/>
<br/>
I am not making fun of you or your son with the laughing, please understand that...I was <br/>
thinking it was more of a suicidal or homicidal thing, that it was saying something like <br/>
that.  Here again, this conversation goes back to principles.  Our kids rarely play more than <br/>
an hour of a game be it WOW or PS2.  We have discussed an &quot;all things in moderation&quot; <br/>
principle with them and then let them choose.  We don&#39;t discourage more play, but they <br/>
just don&#39;t need it in that manner. It&#39;s like Halloween, they could eat all of that candy if <br/>
they wanted to, but because they understand the principle of &quot;moderation&quot; they don&#39;t need <br/>
to eat it all.  They can save, share, toss or eat it.<br/>
<br/>
Also some children are more sensitive than others.  My dd for example hates the quests <br/>
on WOW but will happily go around blessing everything in sight including squirrels.  WOW <br/>
is here mostly as an outlet for my husband and a way for he and his best friend to keep in <br/>
touch and do something fun long distance. <br/>
<br/>
I hope your son will be ok.....sorry the game effected him, and you, in that manner.</div>

&gt; clearly and it was just a character saying it. It says it right after <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m not sure how well this post will be recieved. I apologize <br/>
&gt; if<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I offend anyone but I can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; just sit by and not share the information. I wish I had known a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; long time ago.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Months ago there were posts about WOW and many parents <br/>
&gt; including<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; myself posted<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about us or our children/husbands playing this game. My son (12<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; now) played this game<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; almost every day for 9 months, anywhere from 12-15 hours a day <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; would have strange<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; episodes when he couldn&#39;t play for one reason or another, <br/>
&gt; sometimes<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; shaking<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; uncontrollably. He chose on his own to stop playing about 3 <br/>
&gt; months<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ago because these<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; episodes scared him so much.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The other night my son was cruising YouTube and found some <br/>
&gt; videos<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; claiming that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; WOW had subliminal messages. We both kind of laughed about it, <br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; really believing it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We went to the part of the game that the video indicated and my <br/>
&gt; son<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; changed some of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sound settings and we heard it. We spent the morning learning <br/>
&gt; about<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; subliminal<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; messaging and why it is illegal. It was very scary. My son is <br/>
&gt; now<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; so upset that he won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; use his own bathroom and barely will leave the room that I&#39;m in.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am very angry about this and needed to share it with other<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; parents. I had no problem<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with him wanting to play a game that he loved-I&#39;m upset that he <br/>
&gt; was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; manipulated and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; controlled.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Again, I apologize if I have offended anyone. That is not my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; intention at all.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You can go to YouTube and see the videos for yourselves. I <br/>
&gt; think<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; you would just search<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; world of warcraft subliminal messages.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m not familiar with World of Warcraft, but I have seen evidence of <br/>
the impact of subliminal messages.  I think it&#39;s important to share <br/>
what we know and have experienced, and leave what happens with that <br/>
information up to each person receiving it.  I appreciate what you <br/>
shared! <br/>
<br/>
Bruce Lipton, PhD has some great books on energy medicine and epi-<br/>
genetics, and I heard him share in a lecture that some people&#39;s <br/>
lives/reactions/thoughts are controlled 95% by their subconscious <br/>
mind.  Fortunately, we can all ultimately change this.  One very <br/>
interesting field that impacts this directly is EFT (Emotional <br/>
Freedom Technique).  If you are interested in checking this out, <br/>
here&#39;s a link:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.emofree.com/">http://www.emofree.com/</a>  I found a local practitioner through this <br/>
website.  It&#39;s FASCINATING to me, and several of my friends with <br/>
significant anxiety disorders have been helped with EFT more than <br/>
anything they have ever tried.  One friend was able to fly to France <br/>
without anxiety meds for the first time!  Maybe this could help your <br/>
son.<br/>

Ah, so it&#39;s actually more a deliberate feature of the game, sort of like<br/>
paying Charon to ferry you across the Styx... if you pay, you get to go<br/>
away from what killed you; of you don&#39;t, you respawn right there and<br/>

her is a bonus I&#39;m thrilled she can get (she loves her pets and her  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1611278045">&quot;Is that child unschooled?&quot; &quot;Where the parents unschooled?...&quot;<br/>
Are those the answers to everything?  There are real questions and<br/>
concerns.  Things that parents are asking to try to make a life for<br/>
their kids that are happy and have all the things available to them<br/>
while still helping to keep them safe in a world that seems, at times,<br/>
bent on screwing them up.  And yet the answers all seem to be &quot;that<br/>
would never happen to an unschooled child&quot;.  Well, great, but, um, can<br/>
I still have some advice????<br/>
<br/>
I have three children.  They are all really young still so I am the<br/>
first to admit that we are new to unschooling but I, and my husband,<br/>
played WoW for several years so I do feel I have some insight to<br/>
share.  Though I have heard others mention addiction (and get quite<br/>
picked apart because they used the poison &quot;A&quot; word) I was not trying<br/>
to warn about addiction. I really just wanted to point out/ask two things.<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible to have too much of a good thing?  To play the game so<br/>
much, especially the &quot;end game&quot; that you lose interest in other<br/>
things?  Is it too much to warn/advise/whatever that this game, unlike<br/>
Mario Bros for example, can become all encompassing and to make sure<br/>
that you stay involved? <br/>
<br/>
The other question goes to real world time and man/woman power<br/>
availabilities.  I have three children as I said.  If I fast forward<br/>
to a few years from now (or whenever they show an interest in playing<br/>
WoW) we might see my daughter or just one of my son&#39;s being interested<br/>
in playing this game.  My daughter is more interested in the outdoors<br/>
so lets say that she is all about camping and hiking, my youngest<br/>
wants to swim on a team and my middle child has found WoW. Please help<br/>
me to understand how I could be this perfect unschooling parent in the<br/>
above case?  There are three of them and only two parents. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all well and good, and happy, to say that unschooling parents<br/>
stay right there with their kids.  They bring them food, pay for their<br/>
acounts, talk about the game.... and so on.  How exactly do you do<br/>
that without cloning yourself and still have anything for the other<br/>
children?<br/>
<br/>
There is a fear about this game.  Some of it might very well be<br/>
unfounded or only occurring with those horrible schooled kids.  The<br/>
problem that I was trying to advise on was the idea that people love<br/>
that game.  It can become all that you want to do.  If you have only<br/>
one child you might have the time to stay as involved as has been<br/>
suggested.  I really would like to know, however, how you do it with<br/>
more than one child.  I&#39;m not trying to attack anyone and if the<br/>
answer really is, &quot;if you were unschooling correctly you would be<br/>
fine....&quot; I would like some actual examples of how to help in the<br/>
situations that I described.</div>

If your child was into reading  books like crazy ( I went as a teen thru fases lke that) would that be bad too?<br/>
Or a concern?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1956705017">&quot;Is that child unschooled?&quot; &quot;Where the parents unschooled?...&quot;<br/>
Are those the answers to everything? There are real questions and<br/>
concerns. Things that parents are asking to try to make a life for<br/>
their kids that are happy and have all the things available to them<br/>
while still helping to keep them safe in a world that seems, at times,<br/>
bent on screwing them up. And yet the answers all seem to be &quot;that<br/>
would never happen to an unschooled child&quot;. Well, great, but, um, can<br/>
I still have some advice????<br/>
<br/>
*******Because unschooled children are parented differently and supported in<br/>
their interest, the problems as they are seen in mainstream society don&#39;t<br/>
manifest.<br/>
<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
I have three children. They are all really young still so I am the<br/>
first to admit that we are new to unschooling but I, and my husband,<br/>
played WoW for several years so I do feel I have some insight to<br/>
share. Though I have heard others mention addiction (and get quite<br/>
picked apart because they used the poison &quot;A&quot; word) I was not trying<br/>
to warn about addiction. I really just wanted to point out/ask two things.<br/>
<br/>
***** I have three children and a dh that plays WoW. There are times he<br/>
plays a lot. If he is working on a quest or working on a dungeon or raid. He<br/>
can&#39;t leave in the middle of a dungeon or raid, it would affect others he is<br/>
playing with. He is an awesome human, loving, supportive husband and father.<br/>
He loves his job and his life. WoW is fun not escape.<br/>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible to have too much of a good thing? To play the game so<br/>
much, especially the &quot;end game&quot; that you lose interest in other<br/>
things? Is it too much to warn/advise/whatever that this game, unlike<br/>
Mario Bros for example, can become all encompassing and to make sure<br/>
that you stay involved?<br/>
<br/>
******too much of a good thing, for whom?<br/>
When my kids are engrossed in any passionate pursuit they &quot;lose interest&quot; in<br/>
other stuff for a while. Actually, right now the two older ones dd12 and ds6<br/>
are playing Mario Galaxy for many hours a day. My ds especially. He has 29<br/>
power stars. At this moment he is away from the wii, giving his sister a<br/>
turn, and playing tech decks with is papa. The only time I discuss his<br/>
playing is if he is getting really stressed out about a level. I suggest he<br/>
takes a few deep breathes and either go back to it or change levels or play<br/>
something different for a while. He is free to take my advice or not. He<br/>
tends to follow his heart and take my advice into consideration. He doesn&#39;t<br/>
want to feel stressed.<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
The other question goes to real world time and man/woman power<br/>
availabilities. I have three children as I said. If I fast forward<br/>
to a few years from now (or whenever they show an interest in playing<br/>
WoW) we might see my daughter or just one of my son&#39;s being interested<br/>
in playing this game. My daughter is more interested in the outdoors<br/>
so lets say that she is all about camping and hiking, my youngest<br/>
wants to swim on a team and my middle child has found WoW. Please help<br/>
me to understand how I could be this perfect unschooling parent in the<br/>
above case? There are three of them and only two parents.<br/>
<br/>
*******My kids are quite far apart in ages and interests. It can be<br/>
challenging to keep up with all of them. I don&#39;t aim for perfection (ok well<br/>
I try not to) my aim is more to be supportive and helpful. For ds6 that<br/>
means buying games and playing with or being near him while he plays. I can<br/>
play with the baby or nurse her while he plays. I watch him and comment on<br/>
his game. I get him food/drinks etc. We research stuff ont he internet. I<br/>
pick up things he might like when I see them. I play pokemon with him and I<br/>
found that I love it. For my older child I do what she tells me :-) She<br/>
needs a lot of alone times so I navigate her world according to her needs. I<br/>
bring her food but don&#39;t get as involved in her world. I read the same books<br/>
as she is so we can talk about them. She loves that and is always bringing<br/>
me books. I pick up things she is interested in when I see them. I might<br/>
email her somthing I think she will like.<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all well and good, and happy, to say that unschooling parents<br/>
stay right there with their kids. They bring them food, pay for their<br/>
acounts, talk about the game.... and so on. How exactly do you do<br/>
that without cloning yourself and still have anything for the other<br/>
children?<br/>
<br/>
******I am lucky to have a supportive dh. He is right there with the kidlets<br/>
too. In fact he is playing right now while I type (nearby). It seems like at<br/>
least one of us (the parents) is attracted enough to an interst to support<br/>
it thoroughly. I love to support ds6 tech deck by buying his boards and<br/>
standing in the store with a toddler for hours while he picks the right<br/>
deck. Dh supports this by building the ramps and playing the games. We both<br/>
will help him find you tube videos or other neat stuff online. --this is<br/>
just one interest but they all work out roughly the same.<br/>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
There is a fear about this game. Some of it might very well be<br/>
unfounded or only occurring with those horrible schooled kids. The<br/>
problem that I was trying to advise on was the idea that people love<br/>
that game. It can become all that you want to do. If you have only<br/>
one child you might have the time to stay as involved as has been<br/>
suggested. I really would like to know, however, how you do it with<br/>
more than one child. I&#39;m not trying to attack anyone and if the<br/>
answer really is, &quot;if you were unschooling correctly you would be<br/>
fine....&quot; I would like some actual examples of how to help in the<br/>
situations that I described.<br/>
<br/>
****I don&#39;t know exactly what you are asking. What do you want specific<br/>
examples of?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1175915840">&quot;Is that child unschooled?&quot; &quot;Where the parents unschooled?. ..&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Are those the answers to everything? <br/>
---------------<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the answer is about getting perspective. Sometimes the perspective is if you are parenting in this radically different way, this way that is about a partnership and not about a top down approach, than you can let go of some of your concerns, your worries because you have taken yourself and your family outside the box. The box is an important debilitator and enabler. Within that box a lot of rules do apply, but if you walk outside and look around you, games are games, they aren&#39;t addictions, chores are jobs that you want done but don&#39;t always want to do, food is food you are hungry for, whatever food it is. It&#39;s an amazing thing living outside of that box. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling means that you are there with your children helping them to do what they want to do. If you are there with your kids, if you are with them playing WoW or playing Burnout Paradise (as David is right now with the most amazing advice and support from Simon and Linnaea) or hanging out talking about all the amazing things that fascinate them, than the answer is in the unschooling. Comparing the risks of WoW &quot;addiction&quot; to someone who grew up in a home with an alcoholic parent or in an abusive home or a neglectful home or one where video games where enjoyed only with the guilt of parental disapproval to that of a child within an unschooling household isn&#39;t a like for like comparison. <br/>
<br/>
----------------<br/>
There are real questions and<br/>
concerns. <br/>
--------------<br/>
<br/>
Absolutely there are real questions and concerns. Nobody is making light of those things. But they are saying that sometimes the conditions that create concerns aren&#39;t the conditions that exist in an unschooling household. Addiction may be about environment more than it is about substance, being concerned about the substance instead of the environment may not be the best approach. <br/>
<br/>
-----------<br/>
Things that parents are asking to try to make a life for<br/>
their kids that are happy and have all the things available to them<br/>
while still helping to keep them safe in a world that seems, at times,<br/>
bent on screwing them up. <br/>
----------------<br/>
<br/>
The world that I live in has no ulterior motive when it comes to my children. It isn&#39;t gunning for them, it isn&#39;t waiting for them to fall so that it can rend them limb from limb in some horribly graphic, slow motion scene from Fallout 3 (a game that stuns me, totally loving the mole rats from the post-apocalypse). The world I live in is filled with good things, interesting things, engaging things, moments waiting to be spun into other things. Those things that aren&#39;t so good, aren&#39;t so interesting, aren&#39;t so tasty or appealling get moved to the side of the plate. <br/>
<br/>
---------------<br/>
Is it possible to have too much of a good thing?  To play the game so<br/>
much, especially the &quot;end game&quot; that you lose interest in other<br/>
things?  Is it too much to warn/advise/ whatever that this game, unlike<br/>
Mario Bros for example, can become all encompassing and to make sure<br/>
that you stay involved?<br/>
-----------------<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know. It has never happened in my house. I have two children, Simon who is 11 and Linnaea who is 8, and neither of them have had any game become so all encompassing that they lose interest in all other things. Usually if something is so exciting they try and share it with the rest of us, they seek us out and call to us and ask us to join in whatever it is that is making their hearts sing. And we come. We come and we share and we help and we encourage. I have found the most amazing walkthroughs on the internet. I get so excited by these games, they are such beautiful pieces of art, I play them. Today Linnaea got frustrated playing Banjo Kazooie Nuts and Bolts. I came and sat with her and she told me there was a race she couldn&#39;t do. I&#39;d done the race a couple of days ago, but it was hard and I&#39;d had to rebuild my car 5 times to win the race. So she let me rebuild her car and it still wasn&#39;t right, so she rebuilt it and won the race the next go.<br/>
 And she played a little longer and then quit to let Simon play after realizing that he&#39;d been waiting to play for an hour and a half (he was busy during the wait, but waiting was frustrating him). <br/>
<br/>
Nothing has become more interesting to me than Simon and Linnaea. Nothing. That means that when they are absorbed by some new and exciting thing I can be there to help them to meet their needs. I can bring them food and drink. I can help to find the tricks or the shortcuts to make moving from one level to the next easier. Or make sure that they have the next book in the series before they finish the one they are on, or find a way to get to skating a couple of times a month, or more if they want it, or put the next Merlin episode on the calendar so we don&#39;t forget it. Because they are my priority and my joy I get to help facilitate their joy. <br/>
<br/>
------------<br/>
The other question goes to real world time and man/woman power<br/>
availabilities.  I have three children as I said.  If I fast forward<br/>
to a few years from now (or whenever they show an interest in playing<br/>
WoW) we might see my daughter or just one of my son&#39;s being interested<br/>
in playing this game.  My daughter is more interested in the outdoors<br/>
so lets say that she is all about camping and hiking, my youngest<br/>
wants to swim on a team and my middle child has found WoW. Please help<br/>
me to understand how I could be this perfect unschooling parent in the<br/>
above case?  There are three of them and only two parents. <br/>
-------------<br/>
<br/>
This is hypothetical. Your kids aren&#39;t tearing you into three directions right now. This is a bit of devil&#39;s advocate and a bit of premature worrying, right? <br/>
<br/>
Simon prefers to stay home often, however he is really pretty good about coming with us when it is pressing. It helps that David and I try and let him stay home as much as we can. He knows that we are willing to bend over backwards for him which makes him much more accomodating than I can remember being at 11. It helps if the trip into town includes things that interest him, bribery helps. A trip to the game store, going to the library to see what they have to rent, a round of laser tag, all of those help if there is reticence on Simon&#39;s or Linnaea&#39;s part. It also helps if he wants to go into town and get something that we do it. It happens really quickly that we go and do what he wants to do. Do it with food too. Linnaea says she wants samosas, we make samosas for dinner if we have everything or the next day if there is too little time and too few supplies at home. <br/>
<br/>
What you are worrying about is hours in a day, but it isn&#39;t all in one day. Sometimes it&#39;s hours in a week or a month or a year, and it helps if you see that it doesn&#39;t all have to happen all at once. Simon and Linnaea see that more and more. They see that David and I do what we can all the time to meet their desires. So if we can&#39;t do it that minute we work to make sure that it happens soon. <br/>
<br/>
----------------<br/>
There is a fear about this game.  Some of it might very well be<br/>
unfounded or only occurring with those horrible schooled kids.  The<br/>
problem that I was trying to advise on was the idea that people love<br/>
that game.  It can become all that you want to do.  If you have only<br/>
one child you might have the time to stay as involved as has been<br/>
suggested.  I really would like to know, however, how you do it with<br/>
more than one child.  I&#39;m not trying to attack anyone and if the<br/>
answer really is, &quot;if you were unschooling correctly you would be<br/>
fine....&quot; I would like some actual examples of how to help in the<br/>
situations that I described. <br/>
---------------<br/>
<br/>
I have more than one child. I am really involved. I play the games, I skate when we go skating, I bike ride to the store with company in the summer, I swim at the pool, I bounce on the trampolines. Often I do this with both children, often it isn&#39;t that I am being torn in half to be with one versus the other. There is a lot of doing together. Not always. Sometimes I have to ask to be with one versus the other, depending on the body language and the holding and the clear, if not stated, desire. Sometimes they don&#39;t like each other, don&#39;t want to be with each other, feel less than the other, but those moments pass and we, so far, move back to getting along and playing together. <br/>
<br/>
That said, I don&#39;t talk to my brother that often. Maybe once a year, e-mail more. He gave me a brilliant Christmas present this year. Our relationship is distant at best. I have no way of making Simon and Linnaea closer siblings than I am with my brother, so I don&#39;t try. I just try and make each of their lives as individual good and engaging as I can and hope that they have enough joy to share with each other. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1719461751">OK.  It&#39;s rare I take offense, but some of what&#39;s written is annoying here.<br/>
<br/>
snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Is that child unschooled?&quot; &quot;Where the parents unschooled?. ..&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Are those the answers to everything?  There are real questions and<br/>
<br/>
concerns.<br/>
<br/>
snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That IS a real answer to your question!  Over and over again, the unschooling philosophy seems to need to be explained.  So to use a different word then  &#39;unschooling&#39;, lets just say the difference is tuning into your kids or not tuning in to your kids.  If you can&#39;t get on their wave length, then you may never understand unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
You can even step it back some to when they were a baby.  Did you &#39;know&#39; when they needed a diaper change?  Or a breast?  Or a nap?  Or some floor time? Or a swing?  Or a helping hand to stand/walk/climb?  Or were you one of those mothers who waited till the diaper overflowed?  Or the child screamed the heavens down to be fed?<br/>
<br/>
I had very happy content babies who have grown into very happy and content individuals who share their lives with me, and come to me to talk, and ask questions.  <br/>
<br/>
snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible to have too much of a good thing?  To play the game so<br/>
<br/>
much, especially the &quot;end game&quot; that you lose interest in other<br/>
<br/>
things?<br/>
<br/>
snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Too much of a good thing?  Life brings it&#39;s own reality of ups and downs.  Why would I want to stop my kids from having good things?  Life is precious and should be enjoyed.  It helps to give you strength for when the &#39;not so good things happen.&#39;  It&#39;s been said so many places and so many ways, that when one doesn&#39;t make arbitrary limits, these issues cease to exist.<br/>
<br/>
snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Please help me to understand how I could be this perfect unschooling parent in the<br/>
<br/>
above case?  There are three of them and only two parents. <br/>
<br/>
snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have three kids.  Each have different interests.  I never found a problem finding balance and each of them know the others likes, interests, dislikes, etc..<br/>
<br/>
snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some of it might very well be unfounded or only occurring with those horrible schooled kids.  <br/>
<br/>
snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Horrible schooled kids?<br/>
<br/>
Going to school does not make a kid &#39;horrible&#39;. Having &#39;horrible&#39; parents does.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest two went to school and never had these issues.  Guess you could say I was an RU&#39;re even then as I couldn&#39;t have cared less about attendance nor grades.  I DID pay attention to the schools/teachers and changed even to the point of relocating, to get the best I could get for my girls.  When the &#39;system&#39; no longer worked, we changed plans and found something that did.  Guess you could say I was &#39;tuned&#39; into their needs.  My girls LOVED school and did well.  They are both in college now, by their own choosing, both having started before turning 17yo.  <br/>
<br/>
snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The problem that I was trying to advise on was the idea that people love that game.  <br/>
<br/>
snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So????<br/>
<br/>
snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It can become all that you want to do.<br/>
<br/>
snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Once again, so?<br/>
<br/>
So they play while it holds thier interest and move on when it doesn&#39;t.  No biggy.<br/>
I let my kids get immersed. They get their fill then move onto something else.  My son (11) is currently studing Biology at the college level because he is interested in it.  Should I not be providing him all the material and information he wants as he explores this interest?  So what if he gets immersed.  When he wanted a zillion little green army men and wanted to set up snipers all over the bookshelves, I let him do that, too.<br/>
<br/>
snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you have only one child you might have the time to stay as involved as has been<br/>
<br/>
suggested.  I really would like to know, however, how you do it with more than one child<br/>
<br/>
snip&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
I work full-time as the Manager at my Government Office.  I can&#39;t spend unlimited time with my children which was one of the reasons I didn&#39;t start out homeschooling nor unschooling.<br/>
My spouse is a professional Firefighter which requires him to be gone anywhere from twenty-four hours to forty-eight hours.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s just life.<br/>
<br/>
When you share your life with your children, and you care about thier needs, a magical thing happens.  They return the favor.  Sometimes you just have to figure things out for yourself.  <br/>
<br/>
snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would like some actual examples of how to help in the situations that I described.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A loving home, takes everyone&#39;s needs into consideration and there is no &#39;one size fits all&#39; remedy.  The archives are filled with many, many suggestions so I might suggest looking there for answers to how different families deal with more then one kid.  <br/>
