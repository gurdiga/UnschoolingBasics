<div id="ygrps-yiv-743659423">&quot;I have read, and not participated much, on unschooling lists for<br/>
several years because that is where (on the internet) I found people<br/>
most in line with my philosophy towards my children. But I&#39;ve<br/>
always been a little bit baffled by the implication that unschooling<br/>
is the only way to have that kind of relationship with your kids,<br/>
and that lack of curriculum necessarily goes along with lack of<br/>
rules so to speak.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone has ever implied that unschooling is the only way<br/>
to have a great relationship with their children. I think that it&#39;s<br/>
highly implied that mindful parenting IS absolutely the BETTER way. <br/>
And how mindful is it to force your child into school? (the average<br/>
parent)<br/>
<br/>
How many of those schooled children have a choice to be there or not?<br/>
I&#39;d just about bet that yours were probably the only ones in that<br/>
particular school...maybe not. How mindful is it to force a person to<br/>
spend all day in a place they might not care for. Or not even to share<br/>
all the options with them? I understand that most of those parents are<br/>
uninformed themselves, but I don&#39;t see how you can equate your<br/>
children (who had a choice) to the average schooled child.<br/>
<br/>
Everything you&#39;ve written about your family is the same ideals that<br/>
most radical unschoolers value. A child choosing school or not, is a<br/>
non-issue really. Unschooling hinges on great parenting, does it not?<br/>
A parent that pushes subjects or &quot;teaches&quot; their children (without the<br/>
child asking), really isn&#39;t trusting their abilities. No, I don&#39;t<br/>
think it&#39;s as respectful.<br/>
<br/>
As far as expectations....all that  you listed is about expecting good<br/>
of each other. That falls under personal boundaries to me. I try NOT<br/>
to hold expectations because that attaches me to a certain version of<br/>
reality and has potential to cause suffering. It&#39;s not that we don&#39;t<br/>
assume certain things will happen in our families, it&#39;s that &quot;fluid&quot;<br/>
part you mentioned that is so important. Expectations often set up<br/>
families for failure. Going with the flow and trusting that each<br/>
person is doing their best in the moment works much better in my opinion. <br/>
<br/>
I have a friend that is a very mindful person over all.  She&#39;s very<br/>
peaceful and gentle and really listens to people. She&#39;s very<br/>
respectful to children...mostly.<br/>
BUT, her kids HATE school. They&#39;ve begged her to homeschool every<br/>
year. Her oldest absolutely detests band, but is forced to continue.<br/>
Every time he was at our house he would tell Trevor how lucky he is.<br/>
<br/>
She was undermining that relationship. She was devaluing his desires.<br/>
Do I think he&#39;ll be fine in the long run? Sure. He&#39;s loved and<br/>
nurtured and trusted in many areas. He&#39;s a great kid.<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t about what works or doesn&#39;t work...it&#39;s about what<br/>
is OPTIMAL.  I believe it is optimal to completely trust my child<br/>
about all of their learning experiences. I think this family would be<br/>
MUCH better of to trust their children. I also believe he&#39;ll go on to<br/>
live a very happy and successful life.<br/>
It&#39;s not about end results though...unschooling says the journey and<br/>
the trust and the relationships are ultimate. I believe that.<br/>

[***] True, my kids were probably the only kids there with the choice.  I<br/>
definitely agree that the average parents is not mindful.  I just don&#39;t see<br/>
the automatic connection between Unschooling and mindfulness.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-607381476">&quot;[***] Good point about expectations potentially leading to suffering.<br/>
Is there a difference between that and having personal boundaries<br/>
being breached leading to suffering?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe so. Let me clarify.:)<br/>
<br/>
For me, the expectation thing (not really the way you defined it, but<br/>
expectations in general) is very related to the buddhist idea of<br/>
non-attachment.  Non-attachment is a very open way of seeing the<br/>
world. It&#39;s an understanding that the people I love today, will not be<br/>
the same people tomorrow. So if I&#39;m not attached to this idea of<br/>
who-they-are, I can simply love them in all their fluidity.<br/>
<br/>
Life is change. Being attached to an idea or person or reality is an<br/>
expectation to me. Non-attachment allows me to love more fully,<br/>
because I&#39;m not being stuck on a certain version of something that<br/>
reality may not fulfill.  It&#39;s a very simple, but very difficult<br/>
concept to understand at it&#39;s core. The very fact that I&#39;m writing<br/>
about it here, makes it a non-truth. Because to me, what I&#39;m trying to<br/>
speak is MY truth and my truth is something I had to find in the core<br/>
of MY being. I can&#39;t speak it for someone else. I can&#39;t make anyone<br/>
understand in words, what is my understanding (sound familiar?:).<br/>
<br/>
Other people&#39;s writings and truth and learning has helped me find it<br/>
within myself. But like unschooling, spirituality has to be found<br/>
within or it&#39;s just an empty echo of someone elses truth.  Mentors can<br/>
push us or help us, but it comes down to what is in US as individuals.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, all of this babble is just to try and explain how I feel about<br/>
the idea of expectations. I try NOT to have expectations of this day<br/>
(though I do believe that the sun will rise because it has every other<br/>
day of my life) because if reality does not meet expectation, that<br/>
will lead to suffering.<br/>
<br/>
If I am open, fluid like a river, then I can bend with the moment,<br/>
simply accepting it for what it IS, not what I expect it to be. I<br/>
believe that&#39;s the best way to view those I love also.<br/>
<br/>
A personal boundary being breached may be cause to use words or<br/>
actions to make it right again, but once again, I&#39;m not attached to a<br/>
certain outcome or idea, so I can adapt to the circumstance appropriately.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying I am able to do this all the time. It is something I<br/>
try for.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-413635270">~For the first time, that made sense lol. So basically what you&#39;re<br/>
saying is that learning how to be in a family and be in relationships<br/>
and live with other people is part of learning so it&#39;s part of<br/>
Unschooling. Is that right?~<br/>
<br/>
EXACTLY!!!:)<br/>
Learning is learning to me.<br/>
Learning about how to interact with other humans, learning how your<br/>
body feels when you eat certain foods (or don&#39;t eat), learning how to<br/>
do household tasks etc....is ALL simply learning (aka; unschooling).<br/>
<br/>
How can you say that you trust your child to learn what they want,<br/>
when they want and then say &quot;but I don&#39;t trust you to eat what you<br/>
want, when you want&quot;<br/>
THAT is learning also.<br/>
Everything is learning. Separating certain kinds of learning seems<br/>
very strange to me.<br/>
<br/>
Kelly and I did an unschooling basics talk at Peabody together. One of<br/>
her posts here was all about trusting children in ALL areas and how<br/>
ridiculous it seems to try and divide what KINDS of learning you trust<br/>
your child in. I&#39;ll try to find it. Good stuff.</div>

 </span></blockquote>No implication intended, on my part.<br/>
I wish people wouldn&#39;t read things into what is actually said - we  <br/>
radical unschoolers tend to be very blunt and maybe a little literal  <br/>
- we don&#39;t tend to leave things to &quot;implication,&quot; but say them  <br/>
straight out.<br/>
<br/>
People with kids in school can have absolutely wonderful  <br/>
relationships with their kids. I happen to think it takes a bit of  <br/>
luck and a TON of awareness and effort on the part of parents to make  <br/>
that happen - just because school is so invasive and hard on family  <br/>
lives - soaks up so much time and, through homework, so often puts  <br/>
parents in the role of &#39;enforcer.&#39; But I know wonderful families with  <br/>
kids in school - I would never say that it couldn&#39;t be done.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling can lead to more than not using a curriculum, though.  <br/>
Once people trust kids to learn to read in their own way, in their  <br/>
own time, it seems natural that they begin to think they can trust  <br/>
kids in many more ways. One thing does lead to another, for many  <br/>
unschoolers.<br/>
