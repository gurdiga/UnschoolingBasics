<div id="ygrps-yiv-1317993376">My DD is 4 and we live in the UK.  I have convinced my DH to leave <br/>
her out of nursery/preschool (prompted in part by medical problem we <br/>
are resolving).  He has said that I can &quot;try&quot; unschooling until <br/>
autumn when she is due to start regular school.  He has loads of <br/>
protests but his biggest one is that he doesn&#39;t think I can do it.  <br/>
That I will get too impatient, too frazzled, too tired.  To be fair <br/>
to him I have been all of those things at various times since DD1 was <br/>
born and DD2 came along 18 months ago.  BUt I am working on it.  I am <br/>
really trying to practice AP and unschooling seems a natural <br/>
extension of that.  I have a long way to go to be all AP but I work <br/>
on it on a daily basis. So anyway this has really shaken my <br/>
confidence in being able to unschool.  I feel pressure to produce <br/>
some result by September that will validate my position.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand since I thought he would dismiss it completely I <br/>
feel getting the agreement for the next 7 months a huge milestone.  I <br/>
intend to use it to educate him on why and how I want to do this and <br/>
build my own confidence.  So any support, encouragement around this <br/>
would be much appreciated.  I am in contact with my local <br/>
homeschooling community and plan to throw myself and the 2 girls into <br/>
all they offer with enthusiasm.<br/>

worries rather than guessing at what might convince him. Talk to him  <br/>
about what his concerns are. Write them down. Don&#39;t dismiss them.  <br/>
They&#39;re valid concerns from his understanding.<br/>
<br/>
Ask him what would help ease his mind over the next 7 months. What  <br/>
would help him feel better about it. Revisit this question  <br/>
periodically to see how he&#39;s feeling and if he needs something else.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that might help is keeping a blog. Write down what happens  <br/>
during the day. Don&#39;t try to sell him. (That will come through in the  <br/>
writing!) Find the things *you* think are cool. (That honesty will  <br/>
come through in the writing.)<br/>
<br/>
Another thing might be to prepare for his arrival at home with cool  <br/>
things she did that day. Jot down notes throughout the day so you&#39;re  <br/>
prepared. If you can, set her up with something cool to do --  <br/>
particularly if it&#39;s something he can do with her. (Don&#39;t force it,  <br/>
of course. Her delight will be a better seller than performing ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1893589164">I think that both you and your husband will be surprised how well<br/>
things go. <br/>
My daughter went to public Kindergarten and she hated it.  She was<br/>
bored (&quot;I know HOW to color! Why can&#39;t I do anything except<br/>
color??!!&quot;) but I was really unsure about homeschooling or unschooling<br/>
so we were going to keep her in until my middle child&#39;s &quot;issues&quot;<br/>
started.  He was not due to start Kindergarten for over a year and was<br/>
already reading a ton and loved doing math and so on.  I started to<br/>
really worry, given my daughter&#39;s disgust with the curriculum in<br/>
Kindergarten that he was going to be bored and then that he would be<br/>
labeled a problem child.  <br/>
<br/>
We tried getting him in to public school early thinking that might<br/>
help (I believe now that it would have been just as horrible but at<br/>
the time it seemed a good idea) and the Principal at my daughter&#39;s<br/>
school told me that I should not try to get him in early because,<br/>
&quot;Lots of people are holding their kids back, especially boys, because<br/>
no one wants a geeky child.&quot;.  So after that I agreed to try<br/>
homeschooling as my husband had wanted to try for quite a while.  I<br/>
agreed to give it a year.<br/>
<br/>
We started out more in the homeschooling camp but have gradually slid<br/>
into unschooling as working better for us.  I have been stunned how<br/>
well things have worked.  The kids are interested in everything and<br/>
routinely wow me with projects that they come up with all on their own.  <br/>
<br/>
I think the only difficulty you might have in showing your husband the<br/>
wonder of unschooling would be that he doesn&#39;t have anything to<br/>
compare it to.  Not knowing where the kids would be if in school might<br/>
make it less obvious how great they will do at home.  Don&#39;t lose hope<br/>
though.  It&#39;s not nearly as hard as you are worried it might be.  I<br/>
know I worried the same things but have found that a lot of<br/>
unschooling involves just seeing what they are interested in and going<br/>
from there.  When you see it work, your husband will see too I bet.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck,<br/>
Kristin<br/>
