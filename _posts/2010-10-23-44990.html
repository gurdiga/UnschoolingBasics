<div id="ygrps-yiv-1795610369">The first recommendation when someone is first taken out of school is <br/>
deschooling. Do nothing with an ulterior educational motive. Let your son do <br/>
what he likes when he likes. Help him, don&#39;t hinder him. And don&#39;t press him. I <br/>
believe the recommended time is a month of deschooling for every year in school, <br/>
but that may vary. <br/>
<br/>
It may help if you use this time while he recovers from the stress and pressure <br/>
that he may have experienced in school to deschool yourself. You could start <br/>
here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/deschooling.">http://sandradodd.com/deschooling.</a> And then maybe move on to <br/>
here <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/help,">http://sandradodd.com/help,</a> if you haven&#39;t already begun exploring Sandra&#39;s <br/>
site more thoroughly. It&#39;s a wonderful labyrinth. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1097173676">Welcome Kimberly to the journey of Unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
 I ve been very much enjoying and learning lots from this group everyday through the questions and replies that makes me question more and reflect about my own relationship with my family and Unschooling life style..How much growth has been!<br/>
This journey is yours to explore and create, it is what you make out of it.<br/>
I think one of the hardest thing about going towards Unschooling is letting go of the control, i guess a lot of us struggle to free from this conditioning and pattern.. at least iam working my way there, everyday getting lighter and better...<br/>
<br/>
I am happy that you decided offering non schooling life to your child, this is an experience that will take you both with lots of rewards in a life time, to be remenbered that your son will be the one to lead his own path , playing his own drum,,<br/>
many blessings, <br/>
Tawha.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-62667941">// I just removed my son from Public school earlier this week //<br/>
 <br/>
How old is he?<br/>
 <br/>
Deschooling is definitely the way to go.  And depending on his age and personality, just being with him, doing what he wants to do.  i.e. if he wants to sit and watch cartoons, sitting with him instead of going off to the other room and sitting on the computer, for example.  Tuning in instead of tuning out, but on his terms. I find it hard at times, especially for repetitive viewing of kid television. But it makes a difference to my kids,and it&#39;s a two way street it seems.  When we tune in to them, they tune in to us more, resulting in things running more smoothly and everyone having more fun or at least a better day.   <br/>
I have to remind myself of this often, because it&#39;s easy for me to tune out.  My husband, who is home with them during the day (I work FT outside the home), has an easier time with it for some reason.  <br/>
 <br/>
Good luck!  Are you reading unschooling blogs?  I find them helpful, reassuring, and inspiring. :)<br/>
