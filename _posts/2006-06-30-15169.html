<div id="ygrps-yiv-698538302">I know this is way off topic for this group so please email me off list so<br/>
this doesn&#39;t tie up the loop.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if anyone knows of a legitimate home business that doesn&#39;t<br/>
have start-up fees. We are in a very rough spot right now. We just moved and<br/>
took on a larger mortgage and dh just changed jobs (not making what he was<br/>
assured he would). If anyone has any ideas I would appreciate it so much. I<br/>
don&#39;t want to leave the kids to work outside the house and dh won&#39;t hear of<br/>
it but it&#39;s coming down to bills or food. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>
<br/>

 I&#39;m sorry to hear that.<br/>
<br/>
  I have two---pet-sitting a pooper-scooping. The pet-sitting *can* get <br/>
time-consuming, but you could limit it to cats (specialize! &lt;G&gt;) to <br/>
keep the time pressure down,<br/>
<br/>
  The pooper scooping needs almost nothing but a pooper scooper, <br/>
recycled plastic bags, and a flyer. I suggested it to my son years ago, <br/>
but he&#39;s decided pet/house-sitting makes more $$ with less of a time <br/>
(day-to-day/week-to-week) commitment. But there&#39;s a fellow in town <br/>
who&#39;s doing *really* well with this service---he&#39;s limited himself to <br/>
just a few ritzy neighborhoods and has almost 100 clients (maybe more <br/>
now). Not exactly an &quot;elite&quot; job &lt;bwg&gt;, but he&#39;s doing a needed service <br/>
and getting paid well for it. *Very* little financial outlay.<br/>
<br/>
 You can google it to get some flyer ideas.<br/>
<br/>
  But the kids could go with you and (depending on the temperament of <br/>
the dog(s) or whether the dog is loose in the yard), even help point <br/>
out land mines.<br/>
<br/>
 Best of luck! I hope the situation turns soon.<br/>

  School&#39;s goal is to prepare them to be anything they want. But the <br/>
process is so dullifying and kids haven&#39;t explored the possibilities of <br/>
what they could be that many set their sites as low as possible. They <br/>
go to college to get a job to buy stuff. ~Joyce Fetteroll<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-814533146">I didn&#39;t know this Kelly! <br/>
See now if you lived near me Kelly you could do my grooming and scooping!  <br/>
LOL Do you have a web site I can link? I had someone from SC call me a week ago  <br/>
looking for a pup I wondered if you referred them.. We don&#39;t have any (I have <br/>
a  list normally a good 6-9 months prior to breeding) Anyway.....<br/>
 <br/>
Business Idea&#39;s........................<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve done a few start ups so lets see.<br/>
Locate manufacturers near you that offer products you like. Buy their  <br/>
closeouts.<br/>
Visit Goodwill or Salvation army stores and buy name brand and resell on  <br/>
Ebay..<br/>
 <br/>
For 12.00 a mo you could do Jerky Direct my son has one but you need to  push <br/>
it and possible see if you can get a rack set up in a local store <br/>

 <br/>
OR you could get ideas from these unschool businesses....<br/>

(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.southernmaineunschoolers.com/Businesses.html)">http://www.southernmaineunschoolers.com/Businesses.html)</a>  (AKA  unschoolingmaine.com)<br/>
 <br/>
Most important find something you like or don&#39;t mind doing and run with  it.<br/>
