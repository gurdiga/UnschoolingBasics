<div id="ygrps-yiv-624719130">I&#39;ve been trying to figure this out for a while, and it&#39;s been <br/>
mentioned a lot on the recent thread of Saying no/food.  How do you <br/>
talk to your 2 or 3 yo about food without it becoming there are some <br/>
good foods and some bad.  Since letting go of sweet limitations, that <br/>
was really our only problem, I&#39;ve been trying to inform her about <br/>
foods and nutrition, but I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ve gone about it in the <br/>
right way.  A lot of what I&#39;ve been reading talks about not labeling <br/>
food as good or bad, but I feel Rachel has come to view sugar as a <br/>
bad thing.  Maybe b/c in my eyes it still is.  Basically when she <br/>
started eating candy and wanting sundrops we explained that it was <br/>
okay to eat sundrops but that if you ate too many of them it could <br/>
give you a tummy ache and that it wasn&#39;t healthy to eat just sweets, <br/>
that it needed to be balanced out with other healthy foods.  We&#39;ve <br/>
also discussed how eating them at night can make it hard to go to <br/>
sleep.  There are times she asks if foods are healthy, and we respond <br/>
honestly.  For instance, french fries, not really healthy but it&#39;s <br/>
okay to eat them everyonce in a while.  Do we need to elaborate <br/>
more?  We let her eat pretty much what she wants when she wants, but <br/>
she continually asks for sundrops, which even though we give them to <br/>
her, drives us crazy.  Any thoughts.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Instead of talking about healthy/unhealthy, which may<br/>
sound like new words for good/bad to a kid, I talk<br/>
about the nutritional content. I talk about our bodies<br/>
needing protein. I point out when they haven&#39;t had a<br/>
protein-rich snack in a while (if that&#39;s the case).<br/>
<br/>
Our bodies also need carbs and fat. I think active<br/>
folks can eat french fries on a regular basis and<br/>
continue to be healthy. What&#39;s unhealthy for me is not<br/>
unhealthy for my kids.<br/>

He has to find out for himself. I&#39;ve tried the &#39;this may give you a<br/>
tummy ache&#39; approach but he doesn&#39;t care. I tend to leave whatever<br/>
food he&#39;s experimenting with out and let him find out for himself. So<br/>
far he hasn&#39;t asked for anything I heartily disagree with, though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1894701855">I call that the &quot;wet paint&quot; scenario.<br/>
<br/>
You tell them its bad, but they have to try it for themselves to find <br/>
out for sure.<br/>
<br/>
You tell them the bench has wet paint but they have to touch it anyway <br/>
to make sure. <br/>
<br/>
