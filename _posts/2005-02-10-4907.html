<div id="ygrps-yiv-180489214">I cantl tell you how wonderful it was to have all of your full, <br/>
rich, wonderful posts here to read tonight.<br/>
Thanks so much all of you. It has been just what I needed to hear.  <br/>
I haev done lots of reading - all the books you all mentioned (well <br/>
most of them) I read years ago... I have even put up some of that <br/>
stuff on my conscious parenting website... <br/>
<br/>
www.labouroflove.org <br/>
<br/>
...funnily enough, I remember when I did the education section fo it <br/>
when Dan was still in school, I used to joke to people that it was <br/>
probably some hidden prophesy that I never did add anything to the <br/>
Steiner/Waldorf section, and that the only thing that had anything <br/>
in it was the homeschooling section! I think I have some Gatto <br/>
articles & stuff liek that. So, I have been in tune with all that <br/>
stuff for a while.  I guess with Flynns birth I kind of went to <br/>
sleep again, allwrapped up in baby stuff. I needed to awaken again <br/>
to my first born son.<br/>
<br/>
What &quot;woke me up&quot; again was reading Grace Lewellyns stuff - <br/>
reading :&quot;11 teenagers who donlt go to school&quot; at the beginning of <br/>
last year. I thought to myself &quot;what the $@%# am I doing to my <br/>
son!!!&quot; and anyway, he was out 6 months later. I will never forget <br/>
him running to me on his last day of school saying &quot;I&#39;m free!!!&quot; <br/>
makes me tearful to remember.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t remember who talked about Runescape, but Daniel is absoutely <br/>
mad on it, has been for the past 3 - 4 months!  I&#39;ll find out his <br/>
username, and pass your kids ones onto him!!  Thanks for helping me <br/>
to see the educational value in it.<br/>
<br/>
I know that after having spent years in teh Waldorf system, I have <br/>
alot of stuff to shake off around rules, and whats appropriate or <br/>
not. I relaxed so much from where I was 7 or 8 years ago when I was <br/>
a bit of a pain in the ass purist, but I know that &quot;role&quot; still <br/>
lives in me!<br/>
<br/>
Hey - thanks again everyone for such an awesome welcome, such <br/>
heartfelt and useful replies. I will be contacting some of you <br/>
directly on some of teh more specific issues.<br/>
<br/>
With love & appreciation<br/>
Hilary</div>
