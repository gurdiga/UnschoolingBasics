<div id="ygrps-yiv-233500698">I honestly don&#39;t have any frustrations with unschooling per se these days - frustrations with life are another matter! but when I was just starting out, my biggest frustration was that I *wanted* to parent differently than how I was, but didn&#39;t know how - I didn&#39;t have the tools or even an idea of what the tools were! <br/>
<br/>
So what helped most was reading and reading and reading - not just the pep-talks about unschooling, but anything I could find that described kids and parents interacting. Happily, plenty of unschoolers like to write about their kids ;)<br/>

If you like blogs, in particular, there&#39;s a collection of unschooling blogs here:<br/>

<br/>
Well, I apologize if this ends up sounding more like a rant but my biggest personal frustration right now is both my health and not being able to get my kids out as much as we would like and people (including my roomate) critisizing me because basicly I&#39;m not ordering the kids around and making them do chores and such. Basicly saying if I&#39;d just parent the kids &quot;normally&quot; I wouldnt be so tired. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>What causes frustration with anything? Probably the biggest cause is  <br/>
expectations not matching reality. And lack of control over the reality.<br/>
<br/>
The best way to avoid frustration is to match expectations to what  <br/>
something can deliver. Be clear on what radical unschooling is for.  <br/>
It&#39;s for helping kids explore their interests and providing access to  <br/>
what a parent believes will interest them. It&#39;s for forming a  <br/>
partnership with kids. (And, by extension, partnerships with spouses  <br/>
too to create an environment where unschooling can flourish.)<br/>
<br/>
Accept what isn&#39;t in your power to control. A high needs child is a  <br/>
high needs child. Unschooling won&#39;t change that. But unschooling can  <br/>
remove added stress caused by school and conventional parenting.<br/>
<br/>
Take control of what is in your power to control. Be proactive in  <br/>
solving problems. Bring problems here :-)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And, please, *please*, everyone, there&#39;s a reason that crossposting is  <br/>
considered a no-no.<br/>
<br/>
Besides the annoyance factor, the biggest reason -- the reason that  <br/>
someone tempted to cross post should take to heart -- is it waters the  <br/>
responses down. Ideas flow not just from the original question but  <br/>
from the responses. People on more than one list will pick one list to  <br/>
respond on and each list will miss out on the ideas that could have  <br/>
been sparked by a full interaction with everyone&#39;s ideas.<br/>
<br/>
(And, I don&#39;t know if it goes for a lot of people or not, I&#39;m less  <br/>
motivated to answer a crossposted question. Not to punish the  <br/>
crossposter, but because there&#39;s the feeling it&#39;s likely they&#39;ll get  <br/>
responses. My limited time is better spent on someone who is asking  <br/>
one group of people for personal help rather than trolling to see what  <br/>
they can gather.)<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I know everyone wants the maximum number of responses as quickly  <br/>
as possible but crossposting treats members like an answer factory. I  <br/>
know that&#39;s not the intent, but intent doesn&#39;t change how something  <br/>
gets perceived. If it feels annoying, it&#39;s as good as being annoying  <br/>
deliberately.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>*******************<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to guess in order to avoid mishaps - and that makes me think of a reasonably common &quot;frustration&quot; now that you mention it! One of the issues that comes up regularly is parents diving into unschooling with both feet and then wondering where the pack of wild hooligans came from ;) If you&#39;re new to unschooling, ease in. Say yes more, question your reasoning more, look for alternatives more, but don&#39;t try to do it all at once - it stands the chance of frustrating you *and* your kids. <br/>
<br/>
Another big frustration I see people run into headlong is &quot;common wisdom&quot;. There&#39;s a whoooooole lot of common parenting adages and truisms that are only &quot;true&quot; in the context of kids being made to do things they don&#39;t like on an almost daily basis. Unschooling happens within a different context, so conventional wisdom about parenting doesn&#39;t apply. The frustration comes from knowing that on an intellectual level but not really &quot;buying it&quot; yet. That kind of frustration may very well be part of your learning process! It was part of mine ;)<br/>

In many ways my journey into unschooling has been a journey to embrace more of my better qualities and to actively nurture those. I *want* to be kinder, more gracious, more mindful - truly those things, not the &quot;nicey-nice&quot; social forms that can cover all sorts of ugliness. So the biggest thing I had to overcome was my own resistance to change. <br/>
<br/>
Its Hard to change! Its hard to break old habits. Its even harder to question assumptions that are so long held they seem like solid ground under your feet. <br/>
<br/>
Happily, my kids have made it easier for me - not by being &quot;easy&quot; kids, but by challenging my assumptions for me! I count myself lucky to have kids that make it really obvious to me when I&#39;m not being true to my better nature. <br/>

I&#39;ve marveled so often through the years at what I learn from unschooling with our kids -- everything from opera to bagpipes and back again -- but I never quite put this particular thought together before, that in loving and unschooling my kids, I am thereby made a better person.

My wife and I have two children 4 and 2 years old.  We are going to our first unschooling conference called Life Is Good tomorrow.  Our daughter attended a private preschool but we decided to go with our hearts a unschool her now.  I just met a friend who I didn&#39;t knew unschooled.  When we tell people about our new direction, most of our friends are interested themselves but hesitant.  I am curious about others hesitantcies who actually faced these fears and continued down the path.  What were your fears and how did you overcome them? <br/>

<br/>
I really just had to let go of any residual perceptions of control over my child&#39;s life (especially his future, unknown life) that I was clinging to...<br/>

i encourage you to go to the dad&#39;s panel, and the &quot;secret society of unschooling dads&quot; session, in addition to any other sessions that pique your interest!  i think you will feel inspired by the conference, and probably get many of your questions answered as well.    also, if you do live in the area, there are local unschooling lists  - i can hook you up :)<br/>

&gt; My wife and I have two children 4 and 2 years old.  We are going to our first unschooling conference called Life Is Good tomorrow.  Our daughter attended a private preschool but we decided to go with our hearts a unschool her now.  I just met a friend who I didn&#39;t knew unschooled.  When we tell people about our new direction, most of our friends are interested themselves but hesitant.  I am curious about others hesitantcies who actually faced these fears and continued down the path.  What were your fears and how did you overcome them? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks Adam<br/>

&gt; &gt; I think we could be even more helpful if you introduce yourself and ask specific questions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-308009204">I&#39;m uneasy with the whole suggestion or assumption that unschooling is based on fears or even hestitancies. Does that count as a big frustration??  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;ve been trying to figure out how to (kindly and helpfully) object to the question itself as not productive, even annoying to unschoolers like we are, in its ignorance. For us unschooling was seamless, whole-hearted, full-throated wonderfulness, continuation rather than interruption of the close family life we were enjoying with our young children at home, before &quot;school&quot; choices confronted us.  <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling was no really a decision or leap of faith in the face of fears. School would have been!<br/>

&gt; My fear was that my son would become sadder than he already was after attending 7 months of public school K if we didn&#39;t pull him out.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I hope you enjoy the conference. <br/>
