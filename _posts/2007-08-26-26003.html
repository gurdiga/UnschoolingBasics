<div id="ygrps-yiv-426554708">Boy I need some help here.  An older boy has turned my ds (7 1/2) on  <br/>
to these movies.  Here&#39;s one <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?">http://www.youtube.com/watch?</a> <br/>
v=fIzdAacXp6E  Here are more graphic and disturbing ones  http:// <br/>
www.stickpage.com/  I&#39;ve watched some w/ him.  Some of the more  <br/>
brutal w/ lots of swearing, he&#39;s decided he didn&#39;t want to watch.  I  <br/>
wish these had never been introduced into our home.  I find these  <br/>
movies counter to my feelings about life.  They seem to be about  <br/>
finding humor in being nihilistic.  I know he sees them as slipping  <br/>
on a banana peel kind of funny and I&#39;m bringing an adult&#39;s view to  <br/>
seeing them.<br/>
<br/>
He wants me to watch them or recounts and acts them out.  I say, I&#39;m  <br/>
sorry I just don&#39;t find these funny and I know you&#39;d like to share  <br/>
the humor w/ me. I don&#39;t want to shame him about finding humor in  <br/>
these so I&#39;ve told him why I don&#39;t like them but not gone on about it.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have another take on these that might shift my thinking  <br/>
and might enable me to appreciate the yet unearthed humor or  <br/>
something else that&#39;s eluding me.<br/>
<br/>
OK, let me say it loud and clear.  I find these upsetting.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

*I* personally think this is a fine time to really discuss with him why and  <br/>
how you don&#39;t like it, but that you respect or appreciate his enjoyment, but  <br/>
you&#39;d rather not be a part of that. It may well lead into other conversations  <br/>
and personal experiences on both your &quot;sides&quot; which may help the whole thing <br/>
in  the long run. <br/>
 <br/>
I hear you, Alison.<br/>

saying something about him liking it.  I&#39;ve said if you like them,  <br/>
it&#39;s fine to watch but I&#39;d rather not.<br/>
<br/>
   It&#39;s ironic bc I just bought The Three Stooges movies thinking  <br/>
he&#39;d like these.  I hated these when I saw them as a kid but can see  <br/>
the attraction.  Now it&#39;s upped the ante.  Boy The Three stooges is  <br/>

I say a lot of, &quot;For me....&quot; and always say, &quot;and that&#39;s ok that you like  <br/>
it...&quot; and then I compare food, lol. I&#39;ll let him know how much I love uni and  <br/>
how much dad doesn&#39;t like it, or how much I love a raw tomato and how he hates <br/>
 them. Both tastes are ok, just different. Seems to be ok. He plays video <br/>
games  and stuff and computer games that make me wonder, but so far these <br/>
analogies and  discussions are working quite well. Hope that helps. I&#39;m new at this! <br/>

I see now the one I originally sent is more tame although I still  <br/>
don&#39;t find it funny.  But since you do, maybe you can help me see the  <br/>
humor. I really would love to have another take on this that may be  <br/>
eluding me.   I&#39;ve got a pretty decent sense of humor.  I even  <br/>
perform improv! (Said like, was it the Science Guy?- &quot;I have a degree  <br/>
in science!&quot;) I&#39;d love to hear someone else&#39;s take on this who does  <br/>
find it funny.  If you feel like it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-857436016">I think they are pretty funny. not everything in them but some are hilarious. First of all they are STICK FIGURES not real people can see the why they are funny and I cannot stand the Three Stooges (real people).<br/>
Its a matter of personal taste. I loved the French Move &quot;Delicatessen&quot; Did you ever see it? ( Implied Cannibalism!) Very &quot;Noir&quot; but awesome. I cannot stand real violence and I love nature and animals.<br/>
But I do find some  weird stuff pretty funny like the stick figures. You cannot make people like the same things you do.  People have vastly different taste.<br/>
I do not think a person that likes &quot;the Three Stooges&quot; has any &quot;problems &quot; and should not like them. I &quot;hate&quot; them. Always did.<br/>
Just a comparison for you there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2092403849">I know this won&#39;t be well-written, but I&#39;m hoping that my point will <br/>
get across (I&#39;m slammed for time right now!). I also did not watch the <br/>
clips you&#39;re talking about---no time.<br/>
<br/>
Often when we fear/are uncomforatble with something, we will try to <br/>
make it less powerful. We can do that by dismissing it, by embracing <br/>
it, by making fun of it---among other tactics.<br/>
<br/>
Take a quick look at schools (because of the loop we&#39;re on &lt;g&gt;)---as <br/>
unschoolers, we dismiss it. We live life as if school didn&#39;t exist.<br/>
<br/>
Some folks embrace it---pouring their hearts and souls into it---even <br/>
though it&#39;s not for them.<br/>
<br/>
Comedians and artists have GREAT ways of making fun of it. How do you <br/>
think that makes teachers and &#39;A&#39; students feel?<br/>
<br/>
During the plague a zillion years ago, some ran; some stayed and helped <br/>
others through it; some made fun, threw parties, and lived each day as <br/>
their last.<br/>
<br/>
AIDS is hard to embrace (such an ugly disease), but many folks do <br/>
that---work tirelessly to help. Many more will dismiss it. Seems that <br/>
the majority will make fun of it---as if that will keep it away from <br/>
them---or maybe they&#39;re just relieved it&#39;s NOT them.<br/>
<br/>
Wheelchair---same thing: who wants to end up in one? Keep it at a <br/>
distance with humor: &quot;Better you than me, buddy!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Some people naturally come with or develop better tools to deal with <br/>
what makes them uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think your children will necessarily enjoy that kind of humor <br/>
forever (although it&#39;s certainly possible!). But they should be allowed <br/>
to explore thsose emotions with your help.<br/>
<br/>
There will be some things that will make their insides curdle a <br/>
bit---and that&#39;s worth examining. But if you&#39;re not there, they can&#39;t <br/>
ask your opinion/seek your help/crawl in your lap when it gets too <br/>
intense. They need to know you&#39;re there for them even with regards to <br/>
this---that you find revolting/disgusting/in poor taste.<br/>

I think Alison (correct me if I&#39;m wrong) was simply trying to get a<br/>
viewpoint from someone who DID see it as funny to try and understand<br/>
the humor that she didn&#39;t see. To expand her understanding.<br/>
<br/>
I think some &quot;humor&quot; is about making ourselves feel more powerful<br/>
about things we don&#39;t have any control over. I personally don&#39;t like<br/>
mocking disabilities or diseases...things that hurt people. Though<br/>
there is a comedian that makes fun of everything and everyone under<br/>
the sun and I find him hilarious. He does it in such a way that he is<br/>
mockingly funny but also paying homage (if that makes sense). <br/>
<br/>
I find myself laughing at things that I think  &quot;ooh, I really should<br/>
NOT be laughing about this&quot;. Some comedians have that talent.:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-627012598">Maybe it is like the show south park where they make fun of <br/>
EVERYBODY and it is funny to see the wierd stuff about different <br/>
groups. I think the first reponse of people is to laugh at people <br/>
who are different or strange or whatever but to laugh in a comedy <br/>
situation is FUNNY where in real life it is not the same. <br/>
<br/>
That is why comedy is funny but different people think different <br/>
comedy is funny. I call a lot of movies &quot;boy funny&quot; because it is <br/>
mostly boys who think it is funny or at least my son and husband <br/>
think it is funny but I think it is just plain dumb- but that does <br/>
not change that it is funny to them. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1258087999">Thank you Kelly for your response.  That does help me wade through  <br/>
this issue that&#39;s obviously colored by my own experience.  As w/  <br/>
everything it&#39;s a process of separating my own stuff to be able to  <br/>
see more possibilities.  You helped.  Boy now that AIDS thing is  <br/>
really funny!  No just kidding.  But it helps me to navigate through  <br/>
this.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And Ren, thank you!  Yes, that was what what I was looking for.   <br/>
Feels good to be gotten.<br/>

Personally I&#39;ve found it helpful to think about and research some of <br/>
the ideas behind physical comedy and also the grotesque as &quot;genuine&quot; <br/>
art forms. That has helped me move away from my somewhat snooty &quot;I <br/>
don&#39;t get it&quot; attitude - I still don&#39;t &quot;get it&quot; very often, but I can <br/>
see that as a lack of understanding on my part. <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a clip from wikipedia on the subject of slapstick:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;&quot;Though the term is often used pejoratively, the performance of <br/>
slapstick comedy--based on exquisite timing and unerring calculation of <br/>
execution, character reaction, and audience laughter--is considered <br/>
among the more difficult tasks facing a live performer.&quot;&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-332201516">I have to say that I usually don&#39;t like slapstick at all.  I enjoy most types of comedy but just don&#39;t think slapstick is funny.  HOWEVER  Rowan Atkinson AKA &quot;Mr. Bean&quot; is often stupidly and hilariously funny.  But I will say that if I didn&#39;t find that to be the case, he is worth watching with my kids because of the enjoyment they get out of it...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-927114786">We just went and saw Mr. Bean&#39;s Holiday this week and laughed and<br/>
laughed and laughed - the commercials and previews do NOT do it justice.<br/>
There&#39;s also an interview with Rowan Atkinson in a recent Time magazine<br/>
(either this week or last week). And, in another cool connection,<br/>
MythBusters several seasons back did a test of something that was done<br/>
in a Mr. Bean episode - where he painted a room by using explosives in a<br/>
can of paint. it was totally Busted - but it was fun (any time<br/>
MythBusters can use explosives they&#39;re really happy - I loved last<br/>
week&#39;s &quot;viewer&#39;s suggestions&quot; episodes where a kid wrote in and said<br/>
&quot;Blow up my parents&#39; car&quot;, so they did! They had the kid there on the<br/>
show, and the car, and did not one but TWO explosions - one Hollywood<br/>
style, lots of flames not much destruction and then the real &quot;this is<br/>
what lots of explosives really do&quot; explosion that basically turned the<br/>
car into confetti).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1712264551">If you want to experience absolutely MASTER physical comedy, go watch <br/>
anything with the Umbilical Brothers (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.umbilicalbrothers.com/)">http://www.umbilicalbrothers.com/)</a> <br/>
in it.  They have (had?) a kids show on Noggin called the Upside Down <br/>
Show, and they played the Sydney Opera House (they are from Australia) <br/>
with a show called Speedmouse (not a kid&#39;s thing) and New York with a <br/>
show called Thwak.  They are unbelievable.  If you want to really grok <br/>
the difficulty and perfection of slapstick, they will blow your mind and <br/>
make you laugh hilariously.  I PROMISE.  It is worth the $15 bucks to <br/>
get the Speedmouse DVD from down under if you can&#39;t find a copy anywhere <br/>
else.  I swear, these guys are fantastic!  I would be SHOCKED if any <br/>
person with a pulse didn&#39;t find them funny.<br/>
