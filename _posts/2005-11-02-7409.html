<div id="ygrps-yiv-1328323411">Super Nanny will be demonstrating Pivotal Response Treatment this <br/>
Fiday. This is a scientifically proven treatment that was born out of <br/>
ABA.  The book comes out tomorrow.  It is used to aquire language as <br/>
well as learning new skills and behaviors.  It&#39;s a very positive, <br/>
child centered program.  I just went to the semenar today and learned <br/>
about the show and the book.  UC Santa Barbara is where the research <br/>
team is located.  Their next project is to compare PECS with PRT to <br/>
see how they differ.<br/>

Here&#39;s the PRT web site<br/>
