And I love the idea about talking to him about and helping him find books <br/>
he wants to read and even reading them myself. I know my son absolutely <br/>
&quot;glows&quot; <br/>
when I ask him about Yugioh and Star Wars and Harry Potter. But honestly <br/>
after 10 minutes my eyes glaze over...but Shhh! ..He need not know that &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;.<br/>

Thanks again !<br/>
