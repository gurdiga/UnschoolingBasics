& your daughter are more than welcome to come over and hang out in <br/>
the pool with us. :-) We&#39;re in Ocala. My kids love meeting new <br/>
friends..and so does their mom. :-)<br/>

  We (DD and I) are heading to the Tampa Bay area in a few weeks. If <br/>
anyone<br/>
  is near there, we could try and meet up for an afternoon. Let me know. <br/>
:)<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 We don&#39;t live there nor will we be there &lt;g&gt; , but...<br/>
<br/>
 If you&#39;re looking for things to do:<br/>
<br/>
  Tarpon Springs is fun. A little Greek city with great food. They <br/>
sponge dive there, and have a few snazzy shops among all the trashy <br/>
touristy shops.<br/>
<br/>
  Just west of there is Palmetto, FL. There&#39;s a guide dog school <br/>
(SouthEastern Guide Dogs). In the afternoons, you can make an <br/>
appointment to hug puppies that are waiting to be placed with their <br/>
puppy raising families who will love and train them until they&#39;re ready <br/>
for guide dog training. Our Ryan was born and trained there after we <br/>
raised him. He now is a full-fledged guide dog for his new partner, <br/>
Jaimie. YAY!<br/>
<br/>
  We also went to Bush Gardens. The boys and I had a blast! Ben saw <br/>
Cirque du Soliel in downtown Tampa. Tampa also has a cute walking <br/>
district with cute shops, art galleries, and restaurants.<br/>
<br/>
 Have fun!<br/>

  &quot;The hardest problem for the brain is not learning, but forgetting. No <br/>
matter how hard we try, we can&#39;t deliberately forget something we have <br/>
learned, and that is catastrophic if we learn that we can&#39;t learn.&quot; <br/>

My bil has great shops in Tarpon Springs &quot;Five Fish.&quot;  There are two shops.  One across from the shops and the other near the aquarium.  This would fall in the category of &quot;snazzy&quot; stuff.  Also - be sure to sample the great greek food in the neighborhood.  Or the florida fruit wines (another shop of bil - near the aquarium.)  There is a candle making shop near the aquarium that is also fun to visit.<br/>
<br/>
If your looking for something fun to do - try letterboxing in St Petersburg.  We found an old indian site that was nestled in a suburban neighborhood.  Great short little adventure.  Or one of my favorite places in St Petes is the St Petersburg Clay Company.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.stpeteclay.com/">http://www.stpeteclay.com/</a><br/>
There are also a few great needlepoint shops in St Petes.  And the Dali Museum.  Also the aquarium in Tampa is fun.  One day is not enough time.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun.<br/>

We LOVE going there!  The food is awesome and there&#39;s this shop there that<br/>
sells handmade olive oil soaps that are to die for!  It&#39;s called Get-A-Guru.<br/>
. they have a website that you can order from, too.  www.getaguru.com.  And<br/>
there&#39;s also an awesome Fudge Shop there!  WooHoo!  :)<br/>

Awe!  This is so cute!  I&#39;m not much of a dog person but I&#39;ll still tell my<br/>
sister about it and we might go.  I&#39;m looking for anything to do that doesn<br/>
t cost a lot of money.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Kelly.<br/>

*** and Joanne, I&#39;ll hit my sister up on that one and we&#39;ll see if we can<br/>
work that out.  :) ***<br/>
