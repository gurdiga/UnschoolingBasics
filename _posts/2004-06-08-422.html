<div id="ygrps-yiv-1083144598">Ah, those durn kids that want to go to school, throwing a wrench in our plans!:)<br/>
I do believe in my children choosing their own education, so if school is part of their unique journey, I would honor that. On the other hand, a very young child doesn&#39;t always understand just what school is really like, and may become convinced by peers that it&#39;s the best way to go....&#39;course with their options open, they can always change their mind.<br/>
<br/>
My dd Sierra has always been interested in school. I could satisfy her desire by buying workbooks and &quot;playing&quot; at school with her. It only took a few times of that, to satiate her need. That, and a ride on the local trolley so she could get a bus experience.<br/>
<br/>
Another unschooler here, had a dd that also decided school was the way to go at 5 y.o. Lisa signed her up for a pre-school at a community center, and after one day she&#39;d had enough of that! Too many rules, too many &quot;shoulds&quot;...she was DONE. <br/>
I think if we offer them the good parts of school, the parts they&#39;re fascinated with, it just might fulfill the need and enable them to stay free of the system.<br/>
<br/>
If they do end up choosing school for a time, just remember that an unschooled child&#39;s experience is very different from a child forced to be there. <br/>
I think I would also put them off for a while by saying they can start when they&#39;re 7 or 8...not let them know they could go at five unless they&#39;ve already got that figured out!<br/>

I have never ruled out sending dd to school IF they really have a <br/>
desire to go, but I do feel very uncomfortable sending her at the a <br/>
younger age, even with her options open to come home at any time...<br/>
I am afraid the first few years would be highly glossed over.  Does <br/>
that mean no harm done?  I feel like she would be out on so much that <br/>
unschooling will provide while she is the youngest (as in a real <br/>
early childhood). <br/>

We did send Orion to preschool for one year before we had completely <br/>
decided to homeschool.  It was a nice program, and she really loved <br/>
it.  We decided not to send her back the second year, so she would <br/>
not be influenced about kindergarten, but it has been somewhat tricky <br/>
to explain as she has a few friends that she sees occasionally who <br/>
have continued on that path (we simply said preschool was over for).  <br/>
In fact, she doesn&#39;t have many homeschooled friends that she spends <br/>
time with, as we only know one hs family right now...  ***Maybe we <br/>
need to research support groups more seriously so she can make some <br/>
new friends.***<br/>

<br/>
I think she may have this figured out already, from spending time <br/>
with ps friends.  If not, I am sure it will dawn on her soon enough.  <br/>
I would feel more comfortable sending her if she still wants to when <br/>
she is a little older, put I want her to be happy iwith her life in <br/>
the meantime, and come to know what freedom feels like FIRST so she <br/>
has something to base a decision on.</div>
