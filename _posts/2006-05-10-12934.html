<div id="ygrps-yiv-1520432810">&quot;But I do know that aside from not wanting to teach<br/>
my child that hitting meant a ton of attention from me I also wanted to<br/>
teach them how to be kind by showing them how to be kind to others.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There are ways to help children learn better tools (some of it just<br/>
comes with development and age) without invalidating their feelings or<br/>
shaming them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-690542298">&quot; Time outs are about the only thing I&#39;ve read to do <br/>
in situations of aggressive behaviour.  I will get more into that <br/>
later.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Time out&#39;s are just another punishment, thinly veiled. Punishment does<br/>
not help the child learn to trust the parent, nor does it &quot;teach&quot; them<br/>
anything other than resentment or how to get sneakier (as do most all<br/>
punishments).<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s hitting because she&#39;s not capable of expressing herself any<br/>
other way at the moment. Keep communicating with her, slow down on all<br/>
these playdates she&#39;s obviously NOT ready for and stay very close to<br/>
her at all times. Jalen can only recently handle kids his age for any<br/>
short lengths of time and even now we have to really be careful about<br/>
how much interaction he can handle (he&#39;s 5).<br/>
<br/>
Just like reading or any other thing kids learn/develop into, social<br/>
skills come at their own pace. No amount of punishment will rush that<br/>
process. She&#39;s really a baby in so many ways!! Only 2.5 years on this<br/>
earth to figure out SO much.  She&#39;s very, very little. <br/>
<br/>
I have held Jalen&#39;s hands so he can&#39;t hit me, but I simply hold him<br/>
until he calms down. Sometimes we have to leave an area to do so. But<br/>
he&#39;s never been put in &quot;time out&quot; alone. We simply remove ourselves so<br/>
that he can calm and other people can be safe. There&#39;s no punishment<br/>
involved, I am simply helping him cope with things he can&#39;t cope with<br/>
on his own yet.<br/>
<br/>
We have a thing about &quot;use words first, then get HELP (an arbitrator)<br/>
if that doesn&#39;t work, THEN you can hit if none of that works&quot;<br/>
Well, it never gets past the arbitration stage.:)<br/>
But it does give them an out, a line of tools to use up. Young<br/>
children aren&#39;t going to understand that methodology. You just have to<br/>
be very, very present and maybe get some playmates that are OLDER.<br/>
Same age playmates at a very young age aren&#39;t always a very good idea.<br/>

is very difficult for him.  We don&#39;t go to restaraunts often, but it seemed<br/>
like everytime we did, we would be seated for 5 minutes and I or  Dan would<br/>
have to take Keon out of the restaurant.  We would usually go outside and<br/>
just walk around or if we were at a mall we would go window shopping until<br/>
our food was ready.  Many times one of us would be cell phoning our orders<br/>
in because the sitting and waiting was too difficult for him.  Sometimes I<br/>
had waited just a bit too long to leave and Keon would be upset.  I&#39;m sure<br/>
that people thought that I was taking Keon out for a &quot;whoopin&#39;&quot; but we<br/>
always just went out to do our waiting actively rather than passively.<br/>
Removing him from a situation where he wasn&#39;t able to cope.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes their restless little bodies just need an &quot;out.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
I think it depends on what kind of time out you mean.  The mainstream kind of <br/>
time out where you force the already frustrated, mad, sad child to sit for a <br/>
period of time is going to cause more harm.  We do time outs with Mommy or <br/>
Daddy if one of our children need it.  We cuddle, hold, rock, whisper, sing, etc. <br/>
 Its more of a distraction.  Sometimes we get pushed away if the child isn&#39;t <br/>
ready for it.  Maybe a time out from the playgroups is the answer.  If <br/>
something isn&#39;t working well, we try something else.  There is always something else <br/>
to try, too so you never run out of distractions.  The ONLY &quot;discipline&quot; that <br/>
has ever worked for us with a 2.5 year old is distraction.  <br/>
<br/>
My best suggestion is to try to respond calmly even if she has slammed <br/>
someone in the head with a brick.  Don&#39;t force her to apologize and end up getting <br/>
more agitated.  It helps to model what you want her to learn.  Next time she <br/>
hits someone, pick her up and while you&#39;re holding her address the injured party <br/>
and say something like:  I am so sorry Molly hit you in the head with that <br/>
brick.  I know that really hurts and Molly is still learning not to hurt people. <br/>
<br/>
We do this even when our 2 year old hits her Dad.  She hears and feels more <br/>
when I&#39;m consoling him than she does when I tell her:  no hitting, that hurts, <br/>
which we also say a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Lay low until she can control her fists better.  Playgroups and social <br/>
opportunities will still be there in a few weeks/months or years.  Whenever everyone <br/>
is ready.<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
Robin, who just had to step away to pry her 2.5 year old off her big brother. <br/>
 Everything is fine now--I locked them all in separate rooms so I could come <br/>
back to the computer...just kidding!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1740622623">Reading this comment made me remember when the boys were little. And everybody was telling me how to correct my children. I had the first grandchild on both sides of the family so I did not have a big sis to help me. So I took a class on raising children. The big new fad was time out. I can proudly say that it did not work for me. I would not force physical restraint on my child. I saw this another form of child abuse (this is my concept on restraint). I would put the child in the corner not facing the wall and request the other boys to leave the room. As the child sat there with the screaming and carrying on I would give them a book. I brought big picture books on animals and other interesting subjects. Then before I know it I was sitting in the corner with the child talking about the pictures. Was it a punishment? I saw it as a way to keep the child safe and that they knew I loved them. By the time we got out of the corner I gave him a hug. The situation was taken care<br/>
 of. When we were both calm down we would talk about why I put him in the corner. Then we would both smile because Mom had a time out too and it was fun.<br/>
