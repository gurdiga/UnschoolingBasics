<div id="ygrps-yiv-1675631994">~~Dh decided that if the red light  <br/>
could be ran for a cup of coffee that certainly a crying baby would  <br/>
justify running it, so he did. I likely would not have. I should say  <br/>
though that he doesn&#39;t make a habit of running red lights, in fact  <br/>
this is the only example I can even think of. ~~<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have a story about that kind of situation.....<br/>
<br/>
A friend and I were driving into Portland (Oregon, we lived across the<br/>
bridge in Vancouver WA) to meet some guy friends for a late dinner at<br/>
a chinese restaurant (many, many years ago).  Anyway, there was hardly<br/>
any traffic out due to the late hour and when we got close to our<br/>
destination, a red light stopped us at an intersection. A local bum<br/>
was on the street corner and started approaching the car. He looked<br/>
pretty questionable and he&#39;s yelling, so I look around (NO traffic,<br/>
you can see in every direction clearly) and say &quot;GO Kate!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She was frozen. The rules had been so clearly pounded into her<br/>
private-schooled brain, that running a red light even to stay SAFE was<br/>
unthinkable.  &quot;I can&#39;t, I might get a ticket&quot; she answers.<br/>
<br/>
By now the guy is up to the car and pounding on our window!! I&#39;m<br/>
yelling at her to go, she&#39;s responding that she can&#39;t because the<br/>
light is red.<br/>
<br/>
So yeah, running red lights and talking loud at libraries and ignoring<br/>
boundaries aren&#39;t something I advocate doing randomly without thought.<br/>
But there are times I would do all of the above, without hesitation.<br/>

Definitely!<br/>
I was just reading about that Virginia school  that has forbidden ANY<br/>
student contact. Not only no hugging or kissing, but no high-fives or<br/>
handshakes or ANY kind of human contact.<br/>
Great. They just made prison less tolerable. They just took away a<br/>
basic human right that no other human should have control over. It&#39;s<br/>
insanity.<br/>
<br/>
And we wonder why these kids can&#39;t think clearly when they leave that<br/>
insane institution (ok, we don&#39;t...but society in general seems to<br/>
wonder).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-397997340">Speaking of rules.<br/>
We took my dad out to eat dinner for father&#39;s day (okay, my dad is a whole &#39;nother post, so <br/>
I won&#39;t even touch that). The place we went is a classic hot dog stand, drive in from <br/>
&quot;before Sonic&quot; type of place. The kids all working there were obviously <br/>
alternative...multiple facial piercings, tattoos, various hair and clothing accessories. No <br/>
biggie. What was cool was that during the breaks, they were outside skating against a <br/>
really cool wall and some boards that the management lets them keep back there.<br/>
<br/>
The girls are way into skating. They watched and watched, and had a good time. When we <br/>
left, we had to drive around the one way road, and it was very obvious that they were <br/>
tensing up, their entire demeanor changed with the approach of our vehicle, like they <br/>
KNEW someone was going to hassle them (esp under the big &#39;NO SKATING&#39; sign...the <br/>
business next door put it on their building, even though they stay in the restaurants <br/>
parking lot). DH slowed down to let them finish their tricks, the girls rolled down the <br/>
windows and gave cheers, and they all relaxed and smiled. They did some really cool stuff <br/>
for the girls to see. It just makes me sad that other people can&#39;t see what wonderful kids <br/>
are all around us, they see a bunch of punks that have to be retrained, they bemoan what <br/>
our world is coming to, but we&#39;re surrounded by great kids.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, more ramblings and a recent example of no rights. The rule of no skating is really <br/>
unfair, granted, it does tear up the concrete after a while, but where else can they go? The <br/>
sign was preposterous considering the owners of the restaurant are glad to have happy <br/>
workers.<br/>

<br/>
I view rules as double-edged.  There are lots situations where they are<br/>
useful, good, and sometime REALLY needed.<br/>
I also believe they are over-used in so many areas as to stifle creativity<br/>
and identity.<br/>
It&#39;s gonna take some of that lateral thinking and those different<br/>
perspectives to get us as a city/state/country/world out of some of the<br/>
messes we&#39;ve gotten ourselves into.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1899541156">-Recently I took my 16 yr old along on a &quot;mom&#39;s night out&quot; for dinner<br/>
and a movie.   We saw the later movie and imagine my surprise when I<br/>
sent my 16 yr old to the window to get our tickets and she was asked<br/>
to show ID and then to produce a parent!!!!   Sure enough in the lobby<br/>
of the theater there was a HUGE sign stating that children 16 and<br/>
under could not attend a movie after 9:30pm without a parent!!!  I<br/>
asked the usher if they had been having problems and he said no that<br/>
it was a county ordinance!   Boy that one slipped by me!  <br/>
My kids prefer to see the later shows because they are less crowded<br/>
especially on &quot;school&quot; nights.   We hadn&#39;t ever noticed the sign<br/>
evidently because I was told this was not new and we often go to late<br/>
movies together.    How can we expect kids to navigate the world if we<br/>
are going to make rules against it?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1916966015">~~Did I just lose what could of been a precious memory  <br/>
because I was afraid of what other&#39;s thought? When I&#39;m old and dying  <br/>

on earth would I of cared what other people or the city workers  <br/>
thought? No, probably not.~~<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Great stuff to roll around and ponder.<br/>
<br/>
I was actually thinking about posting something along these lines, but<br/>
you beat me to it!:)  I have a friend whose child may be facing a<br/>
serious illness. Hannah died last year. Sam died a few years ago. I<br/>
don&#39;t have my Mom to share moments with my children any longer....I&#39;ve<br/>
had enough death experiences to really think about whether something<br/>
is worth doing or not doing in the light of death.<br/>
<br/>
There are ways I want to live, that has to do with fearlessness. I do<br/>
things when they are &quot;right&quot; in my mind, when they make sense and have<br/>
a big enough reason to make it worth conforming. It doesn&#39;t mean I am<br/>
fearless, but I try to live fearlessly. Does that make sense?<br/>
<br/>
When I was thinking about your dh and the kids at the playground, I<br/>
was thinking &quot;what if her child died next week? Would it be more<br/>
important that she followed the rules, or would breaking the rules<br/>
seem the better choice?&quot; I vote for collecting a fabulous memory.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m basing this on the entire situation. There was a concerned parent<br/>
helping, nobody was turning kids loose. The park was finished, just<br/>
not open yet....I&#39;m assuming no rusty nails everywhere or broken glass<br/>
(though even that could be navigated safely for a curious child).<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, I think uncomfortable feelings give us a chance to<br/>
reflect, to grow and to learn. There are times that the uncomfortable<br/>
feeling exists to warn us, and we need to trust that. But when we can<br/>
logically examine where the feeling comes from and whether it&#39;s<br/>
warranted (or instinct, vs. societal training) there is a chance to<br/>
expand our comfort zone.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s really cool that you&#39;re pondering all of this Kendrah. I<br/>
used to get really uncomfortable worrying about what other&#39;s thought<br/>
about me or my children&#39;s behavior. It&#39;s very freeing to get past all<br/>
of that and act based on a center of joy and trust.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1387722217">-=- When I was thinking about your dh and the kids at the playground,<br/>

<br/>
Very similar thoughts have run through my head lately. I&#39;ve asked<br/>
myself, &#39;What if my child died tomorrow?&quot; What would really matter to<br/>
me? What would I regret? What can I change to replace that regret with<br/>
something sweet? What can I do *today* to make it a life worth living?<br/>
<br/>
We always think we have more time, but that&#39;s not guaranteed. I don&#39;t<br/>
want to live in fear of regret. My goal is to get to a place in my<br/>
head and heart where I can truly make the most out of what I have<br/>
right now. It&#39;s not been easy for me to do that, I sometimes get stuck<br/>
in ruts and unhelpful ways of thinking, but I&#39;ve noticed this question<br/>
has helped me move past some of my hangups and relax and find more joy<br/>
in little things, to be in the moment and really enjoy it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a total work in progress, but when I think about what matters most<br/>
in a situation like that suddenly my priorities seem so clear.<br/>
Thinking about the way I would want to look back on their lives, our<br/>
life together, makes it easier for me to see how I want to live with<br/>
them today, while they are here with me now.<br/>
<br/>
Which is why I think RU is so truly worth understanding. If you asked<br/>
any conventionally minded parent what they would do if their child had<br/>
6 months to live I think their mindset would do a flipflop. I&#39;m<br/>
betting they aren&#39;t going to care if their kid leaves shoes in the<br/>
hallway, if they don&#39;t like multiplication, if they used 40 sheets of<br/>
paper when 10 would have done, or if they wanted to dye their hair.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m betting they would try to soak up every second, to give them as<br/>
many of the experiences they desire as possible, to make each day<br/>
magical and connected, to love and enjoy their child as fully as they<br/>
can. From my vantage point, families committed to RU have made a<br/>
conscious decision to live their lives everyday like this.<br/>

<br/>
This really struck me.  When I was first diagnosed with cancer the <br/>
prognosis was not so good.  On that day and during many of the long <br/>
nights after I relived every single mothering moment I had wasted and <br/>
even the ones I didn&#39;t waste but only gave 1/2 of my attention to.  I <br/>
will say that regret is a word I had no concept of until that time. <br/>
<br/>
Just something to ponder, <br/>

think  critically about them and help my children to do the same. And then, if <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1677842222">My own ruminations on rules.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking that some of what we label as &quot;rules&quot; are, in fact, agreements<br/>
so that large numbers of people can get along (credit to K for this).  One<br/>
example is traffic lights/signs and other &quot;rules of the road.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Some rules are meant to instill a sense of &quot;fairness&quot; into games, like tag,<br/>
soccer, stock trading, and the like.  Some of these rules are there to<br/>
ensure that everyone has an equal shot at &quot;winning,&quot; whatever that means in<br/>
context of the game.  These can also be viewed as agreements, since we won&#39;t<br/>
play unless we all agree to the same rules.<br/>
<br/>
Some rules exist to either &#39;include&#39; a specific group of people (members of<br/>
a group), while others &#39;exclude&#39; a class of people (skateboarding, e.g.).<br/>
This is a tricky area.  Sometimes these can be used to gather together<br/>
like-minded people for discussion and support.  Sometimes it can be used to<br/>
make people feel less than the &#39;in&#39; group.<br/>
<br/>
And there really appear to me to be a lot of rules that are there simply<br/>
because someone believes that &quot;there should be rules.&quot;  No other reason than<br/>
that.  Rules are so instilled in some people that we should make &#39;em up any<br/>
chance we get.  It&#39;s just the right thing to do.<br/>
<br/>
Some do it out of a sense of power.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure there are others.<br/>
<br/>
My own growing philosophy towards whether or not to do something is the &quot;Why<br/>
not?&quot; approach (still tough for me, a recovering &#39;color within the lines&#39;<br/>
artist).  &quot;Daddy, can we go do X?&quot;  &quot;Hmmm...why not?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Less rules for us means less rules to keep track of, and less stress<br/>
hassling my kids to do something they don&#39;t want to do (or not do something<br/>
they want to do).  They have greater freedom and less &quot;no&#39;s&quot; in their lives.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-826160733">Hi Meredith,<br/>
   <br/>
  My son was standing behind me when I was reading this post and he asked me if I could write and ask you if &#39;a small anarchist community&#39; is a micro-nation?  He wants to start his own peaceful micro-nation and has spent days researching this project.<br/>
   <br/>
  Thank you!<br/>
