<div id="ygrps-yiv-1521044009">Hi Everyone,<br/>
 <br/>
I was going to e-mail Kelly off-list, but then thought maybe someone<br/>
else would know this.  <br/>
 <br/>
I wasn&#39;t sure on the sizes for my kids.  I can&#39;t remember what I finally<br/>
ordered but I have a 3 year old who normally wears 4 T and a seven year<br/>
old who wears 7/8.  I couldn&#39;t tell by the sizes listed if they run<br/>
large or small. I&#39;m not good with knowing sizes, I usually just eye it.<br/>
If you&#39;ve had experience with these shirts in the past, maybe you could<br/>
make a recommendation.  Or if someone else in the group who has kids my<br/>
age could give a suggestion that would be great.  My boys would be<br/>
bummed if the shirts were too small!<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Sunday  <br/>

Subject: [unschoolingbasics] t-shirt orders<br/>
 <br/>
I need to place to t-shirt order BEFORE the end of this month in order <br/>
to have them in time for the conference.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re not ready to register yet but think you&#39;d like a t-shirt or <br/>
two, please order at least the t-shirt!!!<br/>
<br/>
I will be ordering a *few* extra, but don&#39;t plan on buying one at the <br/>
conference. You *might* luck out, but I wouldn&#39;t hold my breath! They <br/>
really need to be pre-ordered!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for making my day/life easier! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
