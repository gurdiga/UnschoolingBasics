<div id="ygrps-yiv-1567217971">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
My son still, after 4 years u/s, plays lots of Xbox, N64 games and <br/>
watches dvds, videos and tv.  <br/>
<br/>
I knew he enjoyed all his computer games, but didnt realise how much <br/>
real information came from that source of entertainment....silly <br/>
me!!!<br/>
<br/>
For example, when we went to the war museum on the south coast of <br/>
England last summer, as we approached, he was telling me the names <br/>
of some of the weapons and armoury. <br/>
  <br/>
I thought he was making it up as I had no idea!!!  I said, &#39;oh, <br/>
where did you find that out from....Grandad, school....&#39; he said he <br/>
likes playing the computer war games, and the weapons are related to <br/>
real wars.<br/>
<br/>
I still can&#39;t play though, the hand to eye co-ordination gets to me, <br/>
and it all leaves me rather cold, and once, when I was watching my <br/>
elder son, I got quite queasy watching the driving.  I do show <br/>
interest, order games off Ebay, Amazon, etc. and try to keep up to <br/>
date with it all.<br/>
<br/>
I am so glad I joined this group, with all the information, <br/>
experiences and advice flowing into my inbox.  I am truly inspired.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes<br/>
Sonia, in UK <br/>

 </span></blockquote>the kids<br/>
will walk away from it on their own eventually. I&#39;ve seen a lot of<br/>
Gamecube time since we started homeschooling and I just keep my<br/>
fingers crossed that the attraction will wear off over time<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But don&#39;t keep wondering when they will leave this activity. Embrace <br/>
it! They&#39;re<br/>
learnng. They&#39;re happy!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1992756044">Yup - I can&#39;t watch much less play certain games that DH and DS enjoy. <br/>
Fortunately, DH is a game player so he and DS can play seriously. But <br/>
I try to at least recognize the terminology that goes with the various <br/>
games and such (and pointing out that there&#39;s a James Bond festival on <br/>
AMC this week - 007 games are a favorite). And DS (7 1/2) understands <br/>
that certain things make me dizzy and uncomfortable. So, if he wants <br/>
me to play, he sets it to one or two of the ones that I can manage and <br/>
sets it for a relatively short time limit - basically he makes it <br/>
easier for me and knows I&#39;ll likely play just that one round. Or, <br/>
he&#39;ll pick a game he knows I can manage (like Hot Shots Golf or <br/>
Monopoly Party). It&#39;s still beyond me how he can be maneuvering his <br/>
character, keeping an eye on the split screens to locate opponents, <br/>
target and fire accurately...all the while bouncing on his mini-<br/>
trampoline!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Same for me, I have horrible hand-eye coordination.  Thank God my dh <br/>
plays PS2 with dd.  I do play, but always end up dying.  She gets <br/>
frustrated with me, so he plays with her.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the WWII game for PS2 is very informative.  My ds(30 yo), loves <br/>
that game and said he has learned more from that game than anything he <br/>
learned in high school.  LOL<br/>
