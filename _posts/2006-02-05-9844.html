<div id="ygrps-yiv-260316489">I got my 16 yr old daughters most recent grades yesterday.  Grades?  <br/>
What am I saying, she has NO grades! A B in choir and Incomplete in <br/>
Japanese and N&#39;s for everything else.  She wont dress down for gym, <br/>
she doesnt study for tests, she doesnt do homework.  Her freshamn <br/>
year up till now has been a waste.<br/>
<br/>
We cant enforce doing homework or studying when we dont know she has <br/>
it to do and it&#39;s not like the school is going to send home a letter <br/>
everyday saying what she needs to do.<br/>
<br/>
I began thinking about un/homeschooling because my son was assaulted <br/>
after getting off the bus one day.  Now it&#39;s un/homeschool her or <br/>
watch her fail at her education completely.  I could send her off to <br/>
job corps. but she isnt ready to leave home yet and I refuse to <br/>
throw my child away.  She is MY child and MY concern, not someone <br/>
elses.<br/>
<br/>
The other two will continue going to school for now.  Hubby still <br/>
hasnt decided if they should be home schooled or not.  Younger <br/>
daughter is special needs and son is above average.  He is concerned <br/>
they will not get what they need at home.  I am inclined to agree <br/>
for now.  We agreed to finish this school year and discuss it before <br/>
next school year.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any suggestions on how to begin with her?</div>

else - a good year&#39;s worth to start. Let her know that you&#39;ll help her <br/>
with whatever she wants to do but that you aren&#39;t going to tell her <br/>
what to do or require anything except that she take time off from <br/>
anything resembling school. Make it clear that you&#39;re there for her <br/>
not just dropping her or anything but that she is the one directing <br/>
her steps. Maybe a copy of Teenage Liberation Handbook for all of you <br/>
to read if that seems like a helpful resource. What you don&#39;t want to <br/>
do is apply at home what was already not working at school <br/>
(assignments, tests, required subjects, etc).<br/>

Llewelyn. Libraries sometimes carry it. Get it as soon as you can and  <br/>
read it immediately.<br/>
