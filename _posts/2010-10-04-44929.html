<div id="ygrps-yiv-1880463089">Hello, everyone:<br/>
I wanted to share this because transitioning to unschooling from a regular curriculum is a little scary. Although, we haven&#39;t done this for a long time, I am so happy about the change. My son and I have had more opportunities to really talk. He loves reading and watching the History and Science Channel. Lately, he has put together journals summarizing what he has learned. He has spent more time learning than when we used a regular curriculum. Also, the stress level has gone down quite a bit. We always felt rushed to complete so many assignments. When that happens, I don&#39;t think you learn as much.<br/>
Have a great evening.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-212791007">I&#39;m happy that your relationship is better with your son and that life is less stressful.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But I want you to understand that what you&#39;ve really done is to just relax your homeschooling. You&#39;re not really unschooling. You&#39;re still thinking in schoolish terms and expect a schoolish outcome.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
While it&#39;s nice that he&#39;s doing what you want him to without fighting or procrastinating, you still aren&#39;t seeing *all* learning as valuable. The History Channel and the Science (Nat Geo?) Channel are (from your post) apparently more important/have more value than, say, Cartoon Network or TMC. LOTS of learning can come from cartoons, old movies, and Food Network.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Take of your school colored glasses and try to see ALL learning as equal. Value the time he spends on Halo 2 as must as you do his time spent journaling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Take a step back and look around. It can get even BETTER! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
