<div id="ygrps-yiv-160208323">Danielle, <br/>
<br/>
I loved your post.you seem like a UP parent.are you on the UP board??  I do<br/>
not know what &quot;imo&quot;, or &quot;op&quot; (could that be a typo for UP?) mean.  Could you<br/>
clarify? <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;The first goal, imo, is not a misdirected goal--if a person is feeling <br/>
<br/>
grumpy or cranky, then being in a less social situation is likely a good <br/>
<br/>
plan. I do that when I&#39;m feeling grumpy for whatever reason.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Yes, I agree, but the person who is sending the child off has to be really<br/>
clear that it isn&#39;t a punishment.  This is something that the child needs to<br/>
understand, not just the parent.  If the parent says it&#39;s not punishment,<br/>
but the child feels punished, then what&#39;s the difference in the child&#39;s<br/>
mind?  Is the child behind the door calming down, or getting more stirred up<br/>
and angry because of guilt, shame and possible abandonment (or a feeling of<br/>
love-withdrawal?).  Yes, he may calm down eventually, but who knows why?  Is<br/>
he exhausted from the situation, or does he realize that &quot;If I&#39;m highly<br/>
emotional, I will be banished, so I better suck it up, pull it together, so<br/>
that I can be loved again&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;There have been times when I&#39;ve gently removed one of my children from a <br/>
<br/>
space, but the goal has always been to help them honor and process their <br/>
<br/>
emotions in a space that&#39;s conducive to that and respectful to the other <br/>
<br/>
members of the household. So, when I remove one of my children or gently <br/>
<br/>
suggest they go to a safe space and offer to go with them, the goal is <br/>
<br/>
to help them process their strong feelings, not to make them stop having <br/>
<br/>
those strong feelings or to isolate them if that&#39;s not a choice they&#39;d <br/>
<br/>
like to make. I&#39;m there to be with them, comfort them, maintain a calm <br/>
<br/>
presence in the face of their intense emotion, whatever.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The intention there is clearly made by the language you so eloquently<br/>
used.&quot;gently removed&quot;, &quot;gently suggest.and offer to go with them.&quot;  I think<br/>
it is so important that they not feel alone.  They are so new to so many<br/>
things in their world, and to be all alone to process (which is really an<br/>
adult term for something that takes years to do well.most of us just<br/>
perseverate about what we just experienced that stimulated those feelings).<br/>
You obviously intend, in that example, to help your child understand<br/>
feelings.  That is sooooooooo important.esp for boys, who still in 2006 are<br/>
expected not to show them much.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;Consciously and carefully thinking through actions with my children and <br/>
<br/>
measuring them against the yardstick of how I might behave with an equal <br/>
<br/>
has been an invaluable tool in my own journey in respectful parenting.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I think that is wonderful advice.  <br/>
<br/>

guy&#39;s big trigger), and the 20-30 minutes was enough to get us <br/>
gracefully through the store and to the car in a pinch, which was my <br/>
intention.<br/>

situation.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>sugar crashes usually happen because the body doesn&#39;t have enough<br/>
protein available to level it all out. So if the child has had protein<br/>
in the last hour or so, it should be ok unless they have some trigger<br/>
due to health issues.<br/>
<br/>
I think sugar is demonized unfairly. I&#39;m pretty health conscious, but<br/>
I discovered that I was blaming sugar for my children&#39;s behavior when<br/>
it was usually something much deeper (like my control issues!!).<br/>
<br/>
For health conscious families, there are many alternative choices<br/>
available, so the child can still have their favorite snacks (like<br/>
Danielle mentioned).  <br/>
