<div id="ygrps-yiv-1260347069">&quot;I sent this message once already. I hope that a moderator would not <br/>
make a<br/>
statement like this (in 3rd person) about me and then not allow me <br/>
to respond!<br/>
<br/>
Ren said<br/>
&quot;I hope this doesn&#39;t sound offensive.<br/>
It sounds like she&#39;s implying that her child needs to be pushed<br/>
further out away from her like her dog and go a separate way (maybe<br/>
not too much but something like that).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
NO, Ren didn&#39;t say that.<br/>
That was from moonwindstarsky, I believe.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t even get involved in this particular thread actually, so <br/>
I&#39;m not sure how that got linked with MY name...oh well.<br/>
<br/>
I did enjoy reading your clarification though Millie. It sounded <br/>
like you were wanting to push him towards &quot;socializing&quot; and after <br/>
reading further I can see you aren&#39;t.<br/>
Maybe if we just say &quot;don&#39;t worry, it will come&quot;, will that help?:)<br/>
