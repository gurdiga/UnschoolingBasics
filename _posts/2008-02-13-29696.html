<div id="ygrps-yiv-1421595045">Those of you who know me IRL know that I&#39;m a dog nut and that I joke <br/>
that the movie, Best in Show is a weird little concentrated microcosm <br/>
of my &quot;other&quot; life.<br/>
<br/>
SO---I had a VERY exciting evening last night when the Weimaraner took <br/>
a Group I and the beagle went on to win BiS.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a Weimaraner breeder/enthusiast for years now and have served in <br/>
several capacities for the Weimaraner Club of America. I&#39;m also an AKC <br/>
judge, licensed to judge Junior Showmanship (and a former junior <br/>
handler myself) and have completed all the AKC requirements to judge <br/>
Weimaraners. My beautiful old male Weim, Luger, took several group <br/>
placements in Europe when we lived there.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thrilled to say that the pair that won the Sporting Group last <br/>
night, Alessandra Folz and Marge, are very good friends of mine. <br/>
Alessandra was one of the junior handlers I worked with when we lived <br/>
in the St Louis area back when she was only 10-13 years old. Her <br/>
sister, Sossanna, is also a wonderful handler and has shown several of <br/>
the family&#39;s viszlak to many, many Bests in Show. They are a wonderful <br/>
family---and they are over the moon with Marge&#39;s win last night. I was <br/>
so excited for them that I couldn&#39;t get to sleep! &lt;g&gt; I finally talked <br/>
with them this morning. I&#39;m still giddy! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Marge is a lovely representative of the breed and is always handled to <br/>
perfection by Alessandra. (As a side note, Marge also alerts Alessandra <br/>
to potential seizures and has saved her life numerous times!)<br/>
<br/>
I really wish they could have taken Best in Show, but as many of you <br/>
know, I *DO* adore that beagle too. &lt;G&gt; I have a beagle myself (the <br/>
adorable SodaPop) and talk a lot about how damned cute he is. I&#39;m busy <br/>
looking for a second beagle now--- I could have a *six-pack* of <br/>
beagles! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The beagle, Uno, is a hometown boy, from Lugoff, SC---just a short <br/>
drive from my house. I&#39;ve been drooling over him for about a year now. <br/>
He was certainly the crowd favorite! So, as much as I wanted to see <br/>
Alessandra and Marge take the whole burrito, Uno&#39;s win is exciting for <br/>
me too.<br/>
<br/>
Sooo---I&#39;m coming down from that incredible high I was on last night, <br/>
and I just wanted to share a small peek into my &quot;other&quot; life. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-515556093">LOL I was going to call you today about the Garden!!!!!!!<br/>
  I knew you knew the Cosildex breeder and was close to them.<br/>
  We were thinking of you all night!<br/>
  I also loved the English pointer that was second in the Sporting Group. What a beauty!<br/>
  But she still needs a few months to mature and the weimaraner was ready and in absolutely perfect condition and yes Alessandra did a beautiful job with her, impeccable presentation.<br/>
  The BIS was deserved, Uno looked fantastic and was asking for it. <br/>
  Overall I think it was a stupendous line up. All those dogs are beautiful and deserved their group. I love the Akita bitch but she did not show as good as last year.<br/>
   <br/>
  You know what ? In a few years WE should go to NY together to watch and have fun. Its always a fun show it would be a blast for us.<br/>
  Love,<br/>
  Alex <br/>
   <br/>
  The poodles were perfect ( Chris and Kaz it is to expect!).<br/>
  I got it recorded on my DVR so I can watch again.<br/>
  Brian is always impressed how I pick 90% of the winners before the judges point to them.<br/>

   I also loved the English pointer that was second in the Sporting <br/>
Group. What a<br/>
beauty!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
yeah---I  think she just needs a few more months to make a real splash!<br/>
<br/>
But Ben and I liked her a lot too.<br/>
<br/>
-==-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 yes Alessandra did a beautiful job with her, impeccable presentation.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-==<br/>
<br/>
I KNOW how nervous she was! But she *seemed* calmed and collected and <br/>
very, very unrushed. I was so impressed!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
   You know what ? In a few years WE should go to NY together to watch <br/>
and have<br/>
fun. Its always a fun show it would be a blast for us.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
You let me know when you can get away! I haven&#39;t been in years!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  The poodles were perfect ( Chris and Kaz it is to expect!).<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
I kind of thought Kaz had it in the bag. I was thrilled for his group <br/>
win---but was hoping like hell he wouldn&#39;t take Best.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  I got it recorded on my DVR so I can watch again.<br/>
   Brian is always impressed how I pick 90% of the winners before the <br/>
judges<br/>
point to them.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
&lt;g&gt; Ben too---but Ben has a good eye as well!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s on USA now. I&#39;m recording it this time. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
