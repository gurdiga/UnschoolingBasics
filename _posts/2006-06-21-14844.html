<div id="ygrps-yiv-1245869907">Well I&#39;ve been no mail for a while and was looking up an old message <br/>
in the archives when I spotted this thread.  As usual this group <br/>
always seems to be right on target with what&#39;s happening in my <br/>
life.  Dh and I were just trying to figure out whether we still want <br/>
another one.  I even posted a question on our local unschoolers <br/>
group, but didn&#39;t quite get the info I was looking for.  Hopefully I <br/>
can clarify and get a better answer here.  Of course now I have more <br/>
questions to ask.  So here&#39;s the situation.  <br/>
<br/>
We have 1 dd now 2.5 my original plan was to wait until she was 3 so <br/>
that I could have 1 on 1 time with the second child when she was in <br/>
preschool.  Now that I&#39;ve decided to unschool that&#39;s out the <br/>
window.  I still was waiting until she turned 3 in hopes that she <br/>
would be weaned and in her own bed by the time I got pregnant <br/>
again.  At 2.5 she has slowed a bit in any of these areas, and <br/>
though I know this could change in 6 mo. I also realilze I shouldn&#39;t <br/>
count on it.  So my original question was regarding concern for the <br/>
safety of a newborn sleeping in the bed with us and a toddler.  We <br/>
have a king size tempurpedic, and currently dd sleeps in the middle <br/>
btwn dh and I.  I&#39;m afraid dd won&#39;t want to give up her spot which <br/>
leaves me the option of having the baby btwn me and her or having <br/>
the baby btwn me and a toddler rail.  I&#39;m also concerned b/c dd <br/>
still nurses pretty much continuously through the night.  Any <br/>
thoughts on this?<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s our other thought dh and I are wondering for sure whether we <br/>
even want to have a second.  So are there any of you out there who <br/>
unschool only 1 child?  You&#39;d think it would be easier, but I&#39;m <br/>
afraid it would be more difficult.  Right now my dd constantly needs <br/>
my attention.  I know it&#39;s pretty normal for the age, but she always <br/>
needs me or someone to play with her.  I&#39;ve actually hired a <br/>
mother&#39;s helper to come in once or twice a week to help take the <br/>
pressure off.  So my concern with just one is that with her being at <br/>
home all the time she&#39;ll need my companionship longer and more <br/>
frequently than I can give it.  So please respond if you&#39;ve had a <br/>
single child that you&#39;ve unschooled since birth.<br/>
<br/>
You guys have always given me great food for thought to help me <br/>
grow, so I&#39;m hoping you&#39;ll give me some things to ponder to help in <br/>
my decision.  Looking forward to your responses.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-603638508">Hi Misty,<br/>
<br/>
We knew we wanted at least 2 kids, but I seriously had doubts because my <br/>
1st was so high needs.  I night-weaned him at 21 mo and he continued to <br/>
nurse until 29mo, when he stopped cold turkey.  Luckily for me, I <br/>
couldn&#39;t get pregnant until he fully weaned, so I was able to get <br/>
pregnant 2mo later.  There is a 3.5yr age difference and it has been <br/>
wonderful.  Jared was old enough to understand about being gentle and <br/>
didn&#39;t really have too many jealousy issues.  It was hard on him, and <br/>
probably took us 6 ~ 8mo to really get on track with the two kids, but <br/>
it has been worth it.  Jared also co-sleeps with us.  What we did was to <br/>
sidecar the crib to our bed (we also have a king, and a memory foam <br/>
mattress) and Jared slept (and still sleeps) in the crib and Chase <br/>
sleeps in the middle or between me and the crib.  It works great for <br/>
us.  So, if you have room (and have a crib), you might want to try that <br/>
arrangement, or you could look into getting a toddler bed for your room <br/>
(let her pick it out and the sheets and stuff to go with it).<br/>
<br/>
Preschool was a bust for me.  Jared didn&#39;t really like it and I <br/>
*thought* it would give me more time with Chase.  It was actually <br/>
worse.  I had to get the baby up early and take him out in the cold to <br/>
take Jared to preschool, then had to interrupt his naptime because I <br/>
then had to pick Jared up again.  Preschool was only 3hrs, so it really <br/>
didn&#39;t give me much time to get anything done.  It was really more of a <br/>
hassle.  I finally took Jared out after Spring Break and things have <br/>
been so much calmer in our household.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps some!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1196341983">Misty to respond to both of your questions...<br/>
 <br/>
The bed situation all depends on the sleepers. IF you have a toddler who  <br/>
would roll on the baby then some other plan needs to be worked out. I have 4 and  <br/>
there is 2 years between each of the last 3(that wasn&#39;t planned). I nursed <br/>
each  baby longer then the other with the last still nursing.<br/>
Nicholas was sleeping in our bed but at some point we moved a toddler bed  in <br/>
here. Some nights he goes to the toddler bed and some nights he falls asleep  <br/>
with daddy and then is moved across the room. In the am if he wakes along <br/>
with  Cameron they play on the bed together, it&#39;s nice. Cassidy used to sleep in <br/>
here  but opted for a room with tv access any hour. <br/>
 <br/>
As for one child... My oldest is 14.9 and I was single for the first 4  years <br/>
so not the same situation though I&#39;ll throw out some thoughts. You can get  <br/>
to the point where the child isn&#39;t so needing of you by offering creative self  <br/>
play toys. Time and age will change things but not  fully. Bringing in a <br/>
helper sounds wonderful but I wonder when that helper  leaves if you then are <br/>
entertainer bc now you might have a child we doesn&#39;t like  to be alone. Or if you <br/>
do naturally have a child who seeks a playmate then I  would consider a <br/>
sibling. <br/>
My son seemed ok when we lived in an apartment and I was single but once I  <br/>
moved into a house and met someone he was asking for siblings. It was almost <br/>
too  late bc by then he was nearly 6. Sure they play together now but the <br/>
competitive  situations are challenging.<br/>
 <br/>
In the end each situation is manageable.. one child or 4 (or more). <br/>
In relation to unschooling hands on/involved parenting is major. Sure  we can <br/>
skip preschool but the true test I see is when a families children  reach <br/>
school age. I see loads of infants and toddlers at the playground but when  the <br/>
kids hit age 5-6 strangely those families who hung with the  homeschoolers opt <br/>
for silent soap opera days while their children are in  school. My point is <br/>
with one child I think you are going to feel the  pressure to do school out of <br/>
fear that the child would be lonely or that you  would need to be the playmate. <br/>
I can tell you I have 4 and I am still all of their playmates more for each  <br/>
than I was when I only had one.  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m not saying you can&#39;t unschool a single child my thoughts lay more on  you <br/>
comments about needing assistance for one while considering another. I can  <br/>
tell you it will all work itself out if you work with it as it comes. The  <br/>
future for you and your family is wide open. Embrace your hopes and dreams and  <br/>
make them a reality because 10 years from now you may wish you  had. <br/>

   <br/>
  I have been in your shoes before my second dd was born.  We had a first very loving dd, who slept with us and nursed still all night!  We started talking about adding another and that month I was preggo!  I couldn&#39;t believe it happened so fast as my first dd took some work.  So I ended up with the same due date as my first dd.  Well surprising to me I lost most of my milk supply right away with the pregnancy and she slowed way down on nursing and just ate more food.  Poor thing!  Then two months before my due date she did not ask for it at night and that was that!  But she started sleeping 12 hours at night about July (I was pregnant in June) and weaned her bed time nursie in December.  I don&#39;t know if they just sense the changes coming and grow each day or what because when I look back we thought three years was so young to have a baby!  How could I do it and still be with her!  But it was fine. Plus a baby needs our skin and smell but for the first months it sleeps<br/>
 alot!  SO that I think gives us time and dd to adjust too.  She slept with me and dh in our King bed right in the middle.  We talked all the time about the baby coming and how she needs to help guard the baby and we get to all sleep together.  IMO if your dd was to &quot;like&quot; sleeping in her big bed she will notice that the baby is with you and she may feel &quot;left out&quot; even more.  As far as safety we were worried too so I slept with the baby (Rylee) in another room for three nights and Jenna and dh slept together.  Then I joined them and at night we would look and talk about the baby and how Jenna was this small one time and all the things she use to do.....  I really think the more Jenna heard her name in the stories as we amazed ourselves over the &quot;new&quot; life we created she was fine with this little person.  I slept between the kids so Jenna could not roll on her.  I feel it is important not to have the kids next to each other until the baby can crawl.  Then he/she will be<br/>
 strong enough to tell you and if you didn&#39;t hear be strong to get up.<br/>
   <br/>
  It is weird now that Jenna is 6 she is missing my time with her (alone) because for the first time she has been saying things like &quot; I wish Rylee was not with us anymore, I am done playing with her&quot;.   It is sooooo sad!  <br/>
   <br/>
  Now we are trying for baby #3 and worried for being out numbered with only having two hands!  Ya know!  ;o)<br/>
   <br/>
  Misty it so works out and its amazing to me how we analyze it and the work it takes to raise this amazing creatures but when they arrive it seems so worth all that hard work of night wakings and such.  I am so happy to hear and talk to others who co-sleep and nurse past age one.  ;o)  Best wishes to you and your journey.<br/>
