Why be  so insistent that you (collective you) know best? I know people are <br/>
here  <br/>
to get *your* (collective your)  advice,&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
OK I really haven&#39;t had time to keep up on the posts on any list, LOL, but  <br/>
did have a minute this morning to read through the digest here and wanted to  <br/>
comment on this one.  <br/>
 <br/>
Personally I don&#39;t look at lists like this as &quot;advice columns&quot;.  I  think of <br/>
it more as: we are all on this path, well some of us are at the  beginning <br/>
just looking down the path trying to decide if it is the one we want  to take.  <br/>
But we are all somewhere on the path.  Maybe I have always  been living <br/>
consensually with my children so unschooling was just the logical  path when they <br/>
became school age, so I might be a little further along the path  than others, <br/>
and less so that some.  But I think of us all as equals, no  gurus.  All I can <br/>
do is share my journey, share what has worked for us, and  what hasn&#39;t (that <br/>
helps too).  I can talk about our journey but it is our  journey.  I may be able <br/>
to suggest what I might have done if I were in a  particular situation, but <br/>
will never know for sure if I have never encountered  that.  I also may reach <br/>
roadblocks.  It may be that someone who has  been unschooling longer than I <br/>
will take a step back and help me move that road  block, or it may be that <br/>
someone who is new to all of this will run up ahead and  help me move it.  Or we all <br/>
three work together.  So I don&#39;t think  there is a &quot;collective you&quot; there is <br/>
an &quot;us&quot;.  We can only throw down  pebbles along the road and some might find <br/>
them useful and pick them up, some  not.<br/>
 <br/>
Giving advice seems like that are people here who know what others should  <br/>
do.  I can only speak for myself and what I have done or might do, not what  <br/>
others should do.  I agree that delivery is key, sharing is nice.<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway just my thoughts on this busy morning, now back to work.<br/>

Edna St. Vincent Millay referred to the collective knowledge of <br/>
mankind as &quot;little gray stones&quot; on the great cairn of knowledge in a <br/>
poem called, &quot;The Cairn.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When I think of the little children learning<br/>
In all the schools of the world,<br/>
Learning in Danish, learning in Japanese<br/>
That two and two are four, and where the rivers of the world<br/>
Rise, and the names of the mountains and the principal cities,<br/>
My heart breaks.<br/>
Come up, children! Toss your little stones gaily<br/>
On the great cairn of Knowledge!<br/>
(Where lies what Euclid knew, a little grey stone,<br/>
What Plato, what Pascal, what Galileo:<br/>
Little grey stones, little grey stones on a cairn.)<br/>
Tell me, what is the name of the highest mountain?<br/>
Name me a crater of fire! a peak of snow! <br/>
Name me the mountains on the moon!<br/>
But the name of the mountain that you climb all day,<br/>
Ask not your teacher that. <br/>
<br/>
~Edna St Vincent Millay~<br/>
<br/>
I enjoy the imagery of what Euclid knew as just one little gray <br/>
stone on the ever growing stone heap of human knowledge.  Then, the <br/>
little children forced to try to climb that cairn. <br/>
<br/>
No one on this list is here by force. We toss our little stones <br/>
gaily. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I like this. Maybe it&#39;s just about deschooling. The collective voices<br/>
here aren&#39;t going to have anyone&#39;s answers. Advice is simply coming<br/>
from a place of &quot;here&#39;s what I&#39;ve learned over the years&quot; as Pam said.<br/>
<br/>
Like the Buddhist philosophy, nobody else can find your<br/>
truth....that&#39;s for each person to excavate. Unschooling is hugely<br/>
about your own learning, your own path. Nobody can give that to you,<br/>
but there are &quot;way-pointers&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The posts here are sort of like a person pointing to the door.<br/>
Everyone has to walk through it in their own way and time. But people<br/>
can point to the door and say &quot;That one will help you with this&quot;.:)<br/>

For me, as an experienced unschooler with still so much to learn, I&#39;m here<br/>
because I feel what was missing from my *basics* intro to RU was a voice<br/>
like mine. It seemed a lot of work to take others&#39; experiences and apply<br/>
them to my own World. And yet the more voices I had speaking to me, the<br/>
easier the adaptation was because I could pick and choose who&#39;s words rang<br/>
true in my heart.<br/>
I don&#39;t want the discussion of *basics* (about any topic) to be only between<br/>
those who are on the exact same place on the Path, I need to hear from those<br/>
ahead of me and understand there are those still behind me to fully<br/>
appreciate where I *am* right now and help me with the sometimes elusive<br/>
&quot;Big Picture&quot; perspective.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1287966530">I have always thought of this list as a group of folks taking a walk<br/>
together... sometimes the path gets very steep and some of us are not<br/>
as physically fit as others so we figure out a little different way to<br/>
get further along the path.  Sometimes the path is going downhill and<br/>
we all can go down as one group.  Sometimes someone trips and falls<br/>
and we help them up... and sometimes someone is tired and grouchy and<br/>
we allow them some alone time to get their thoughts together so they<br/>
can carry on.  No one is here to carry the others, no one is here to<br/>
trip the others, no one is here to drag the others.  Sometimes there<br/>
are people who have already been along this path and they can tell the<br/>
others things that worked to make their path easier the last time.  <br/>
Just think if every single person on this list had the same exact<br/>
viewpoint??   Boy that would sure be boring and we wouldn&#39;t be likely<br/>
to get much out of having a discussion with people who think the exact<br/>
same things we do.   We always learn more when what we think and do<br/>
are challenged... we have to stretch our minds and our expectations in<br/>
order to further understand the path.    Again my new mantra... it&#39;s a<br/>
process!<br/>
