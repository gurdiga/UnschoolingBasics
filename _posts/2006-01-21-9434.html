<div id="ygrps-yiv-855739787">&quot;1) what do I do since my son is very into guns...well, pretty much<br/>
anything to do with violence but I am very against violence?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re against violence. He&#39;s not committing violence is he?<br/>
Is he actually harming himself or another human being if he plays with<br/>
guns? No.<br/>
You&#39;re against harming another individual, that&#39;s very different than<br/>
acting it out. <br/>
<br/>
Boys (lots of kids of both genders actually) are naturally very<br/>
fascinated with guns/weapons/swords etc...<br/>
The more you fuss about it, the more he&#39;ll try to hide it from you.<br/>
<br/>
The most important principle in my life, is that my children are<br/>
whole, perfect and trustworthy. All other principles pale in comparison.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a vegetarian (not strict, but I don&#39;t know a better term, so I&#39;m<br/>
using &quot;vegetarian&quot; because I don&#39;t eat meat) but some of my children<br/>
are not. I am vegetarian for ethical and health reasons. Ethical mainly.<br/>
Should my children get a dose of MY ethics everytime they want meat? <br/>
Hell no.<br/>
They&#39;d just learn to not trust me. I trust they will make different<br/>
decisions for themselves, only THEY know the best path for their own life.<br/>
<br/>
I think guns are great fun...my kids love paintball and airsoft gun<br/>
play, violent video games and such. And guess what? They are some of<br/>
the most peace-loving, non-violent people you could ever meet. Truly.<br/>
<br/>
They absolutely CRINGE when they see people hit each other. Trevor has<br/>
attended peace rallies to protest the war in Iraq. My children don&#39;t<br/>
want anything to do with REAL violence. Play is play. We don&#39;t need to<br/>
turn it into some ground for our &quot;beliefs&quot; or &quot;ethics&quot; unless they<br/>
really are going to harm themselves or someone else. <br/>
<br/>
Heck, then I get downright coercive!!;)<br/>
<br/>
Back to square one....TRUST.<br/>
Trust him, trust that he needs to explore this right now...go buy him<br/>
some really cool play guns and swords and battle with him. Hide around<br/>
the house and shoot each other, it&#39;s great fun. I had a marvelous<br/>
battle with Jalen using broken &quot;hookers&quot; (hangers) the other night.<br/>
They were bows and we used invisible arrows for them and shot each<br/>
other...he won every time darnit!  I can die really dramatically now.;)<br/>
<br/>
Buy some big water guns this summer and have battles with those,<br/>
explore his interest WITH him. Trevor has learned all about several<br/>
wars, other languages, history etc... because of his fascination with<br/>
weapons. I could lliterally write a book about both my older boys<br/>
discoveries that connected to weapons. It&#39;s really cool stuff.<br/>
We have great philosophical discussions about all the ways human<br/>
beings have tried to create harm and kill. You&#39;d be amazed at their<br/>
knowledge (I certainly am!!).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-500517923">I am glad that the OP asked this questions.  I have been wondering the same thing in the last few weeks.  When we go to the store, I never fuss about him looking at guns.  I buy shooters but I have read that toy guns and violent games promote violence in children.  But of course with my new unschooling philosophy, I have been wondering if my saying no to toy guns is really okay with me.  I do like that you said that your son has branched off with learning through weapons.  Honestly, I want my children to know how to handle weapons so that they if they do find a real weapon, then they would know how to handle it safely.  Now that I think about it, it is not the weapon that is bad, it is how it is used that makes all the difference.  Yet, again, I am enlightened.<br/>

<br/>
I liked Man From U.N.C.L.E. when I was a kid. I had the gun. (Still  <br/>

with a real gun. In fact I have a black belt in Tae Kwon Do and could  <br/>
beat people up. But I have no desire to.<br/>
<br/>
I think what is more likely true is that kids who are prone to  <br/>
violence are drawn to guns and violent games rather than the other  <br/>
way around. Kids who don&#39;t have loving homes, who are angry with the  <br/>
world want to feel powerful. Games and pretend violence can fill that  <br/>
need -- until the need grows beyond pretend.<br/>
<br/>
What peaceful, gun-avoiding people perhaps have a problem with is  <br/>
understanding why peaceful people would want anything to do with  <br/>
guns. I think that like a lot of escapism, it&#39;s about exploring  <br/>
something you wouldn&#39;t want to do in real life. Though we haven&#39;t  <br/>
played it in a long time, my daughter and I like Godzilla: Destroy  <br/>
All Monsters. It&#39;s fun to step on buildings and blast monsters and  <br/>
level cities knowing that they&#39;ll all be back together the next time  <br/>
you play. I honestly don&#39;t like to destroy things in real life. Not  <br/>
even things I&#39;m throwing away ;-) And yet the story I wrote for the  <br/>
National Novel Writing Month is chock full of demon body parts flying  <br/>
all over the place. I even electrocuted a couple of humans. But I  <br/>
have no desire to do any of that in real life.<br/>
<br/>
Someone who&#39;s read a little psychology might think it&#39;s repressed  <br/>
desire. But it&#39;s not at all repressed. It&#39;s getting a healthy release  <br/>
in fantasy and pretend. I do I think it&#39;s a big mistake when parents  <br/>
prevent that fantasy exploration because they are preventing a  <br/>
perfectly harmless outlet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-146793240">I love the comments about learning that diverged from an original<br/>
interest in guns.  I don&#39;t have the same concerns as some concerning<br/>
violence and/or guns/weapons.  I grew up knowing about guns and have<br/>
shot before.  I have played lots of fairly violent video games, have<br/>
enjoyed lots of violent movies and tv shows.<br/>
One of my favorite books, The Three Musketeers can be seen as fairly<br/>
violent, and the attitudes toward the violence seems rather blase<br/>
sometimes, fighting at the very assumption of honor besmirched.<br/>
We bought Medal of Honor: Rising Sun and had a blast.  The game starts<br/>
your character on board a ship in Pearl Harbor, waking up to the sound<br/>
of bombs landing.  The game then dramatizes parts of the Allied fight<br/>
throughout the Pacific theater.  In the games &quot;pause&quot; menu, you can<br/>
actually choose an option that gives a small piece of historical<br/>
information based on the particular location, e.g. Guadalcanal or the<br/>
Philipines.<br/>
From this, my 7yo developed a short interest in WWII, Pearl Harbor and<br/>
ess is that we, as unschoolers, never know what&#39;s coming next.  As<br/>
long the weapons of the period.  His current interests have moved in<br/>
other directions, but it&#39;s still something he now knows about and an<br/>
interest he and I share and will share, even if we don&#39;t really<br/>
revisit it for a while. I ended up getting some info for myself,<br/>
reading Citizen Soldiers, a really interesting book by David McCullough.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1040616190">&quot;It makes sense. But is it true?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
No, I don&#39;t think it is... if you are taught about something and learn the<br/>
right way to treat something from sleep and food to guns and alcohol... the<br/>
mysticism disappears and the excitement with it. My family has alcoholism in<br/>
their background and while my mother allowed us to try this or have a sip of<br/>
that - taking away the need to sneak and over indulge; she also taught us<br/>
about our family background and what to watch out for and that there was<br/>
help if you needed it.<br/>
<br/>
My DH is a &quot;good&quot; boy - a healthy respect for authority. However, he loves<br/>
playing the &quot;bad guy&quot; on PC and video games - he would never even dream of<br/>
ever doing what he plays. Even my five year old says the same in his own<br/>
words though he will occasionally change his mind about being a &quot;bad guy&quot;<br/>
even playing Rampage and decide he wants to be a &quot;good guy&quot; and beat me and<br/>
his father up instead.<br/>

We are now safer and healthier, using toxic-free products and saving money,<br/>
too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1327520463">I don&#39;t know who the original author of the issue that Ren was answering<br/>
here but I wanted to chime in.  I saw a documentary on PBS about a week ago<br/>
that touches on this issue... I really think you need to look into finding<br/>
it and watching it.  It&#39;s called Raising Cain.  I don&#39;t have any boys but it<br/>
gave me great insights into boys and since I have a husband and friends with<br/>
boys and someday my daughter will have boyfriends and a husband, I was very<br/>
interested in it. <br/>
