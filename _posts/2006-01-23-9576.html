<div id="ygrps-yiv-1568588421">&quot;Then he said nastily &quot;so Hilary<br/>
Clinton, it does not talk a village to raise a child, it takes a<br/>
family that cares!&quot; I wanted to ring his neck, because for the rest of<br/>
the world that doesn&#39;t have movie stars for grandparents, we don&#39;t<br/>
have the luxury of leisurely family hanging around to take care of our<br/>
kids!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, but he was RIGHT. And it doesn&#39;t take movie stars to hang around<br/>
and help with the kids.<br/>
Hilary Clinton used that saying incorrectly. The African saying, does<br/>
not translate well because the village WAS your family. A tribe was<br/>
typically aunts, uncles, cousins etc... and you married into another<br/>
tribe.<br/>
<br/>
So yeah, it&#39;s great to have extended family for helping raise<br/>
children...most of us have to create our own communities of support<br/>
though. Family can fail us, society at large isn&#39;t the answer for most<br/>
of us and it certainly isn&#39;t the government we want to turn to!! <br/>
