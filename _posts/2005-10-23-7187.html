<div id="ygrps-yiv-1992015422">Thank you everyone who gave advice about my 11yo ds. <br/>
Sorry to bother again but everyone here is helpful<br/>
without being hurtful and I feel comfortable seeking<br/>
advice as a new unschooler from you all, sorry if I<br/>
seem pesky.  My heart is in the right place even if my<br/>
mind isn&#39;t quite caught up.<br/>
<br/>
I asked ds about his passion this afternoon and it is<br/>
quite a pricey passion.  He said that he interested in<br/>
4 wheelers.  He also said that he is interested in<br/>
visiting different places in the states.  As of this<br/>
moment in time we absolutely can&#39;t afford either one. <br/>
We are not poor by any means but have no health<br/>
insurance and no savings for retirement which we<br/>
really need to start focusing on because we are in our<br/>
mid 30&#39;s, we like most are living paycheck to<br/>
paycheck.  <br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if any of you have home business ideas<br/>
(PLEASE no MLM suggestions :-), it&#39;s just not for us) <br/>
perhaps even a small business that kids could<br/>
participate in.  If we could do something like that<br/>
then maybe sometime in the near future, I could get<br/>
him what his heart desires.  For the time being<br/>
though, maybe I can help interest him in something<br/>
that is little cost.  Is there anyone else here who is<br/>
tied down financially?  If so, what has worked for you<br/>
as far as successful unschooling with limited income?<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate each and everyone of you.  BTW...Rue, a<br/>
friend here in Pensacola, Rose, let me borrow your<br/>
book that she had bought...it&#39;s absolutely wonderful! <br/>
I tried combing through to find advice for limited<br/>
finances but either I missed it or it&#39;s not there. <br/>
:-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Peace and Joy,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2024477883">In the meantime, while you figure out money issues, see if you can  <br/>
think outside the box and find ways he can pursue his interests in  <br/>
SPITE of not having money. I think you&#39;re thinking there is only one  <br/>
way to do this, but I bet you&#39;re wrong.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t even know what &quot;4 wheelers&quot; means, so can&#39;t give specific  <br/>
ideas, but I have a friend whose son is interested in flying  <br/>
airplanes and he joined the Civil Air Patrol and, eventually, after a  <br/>
LOT of hard work, got to the point of flying gliders and now  <br/>
airplanes, too.<br/>
<br/>
Start thinking about whether there is some way for him to just be  <br/>
around people doing what he wants to do, for example. I don&#39;t know  <br/>
what else, but I bet you can think of something. Also - get him  <br/>
magazines, go to &quot;4 wheeler&quot; shows (are there such things?), go to  <br/>
events where they are featured, look for documentaries on video, or  <br/>
whatever else you can think of..... It doesn&#39;t have to be jumping in  <br/>
full board by spending a lot of money.<br/>
<br/>
Do show him that you respect his passion, that you take it seriously,  <br/>
that it IS important to you that he gets SOME opportunity to pursue it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My daughter was passionate about cats. My husband is ExTREMELY  <br/>
allergic to them - dangerously so. So, she and I went to cat shows,  <br/>
we talked to breeders, we volunteered at a shelter, and she  <br/>
subscribed to Cat Fancy magazine for years. She knows that was the  <br/>
best we could do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-620316405">I just joined postcardkids <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.groups.yahoo.com/groups/postcardkids)">http://www.groups.yahoo.com/groups/postcardkids)</a>.  We swap postcards, which <br/>
has been a natural and fun way to talk about geography.  Nathaniel (he&#39;s 3) <br/>
has been asking me for a couple months about places (states, towns, <br/>
streets).  I think he has been trying to get a mental picture of the world.  <br/>
He just suddenly started asking questions one day and was so thrilled that <br/>
we had a puzzle and atlas where I could show him.  He also LOVES getting <br/>
mail.  When he is ready (which I&#39;m guessing would be in the next year or two <br/>
or three ...), he can write the cards himself and maybe sometime after that, <br/>
read them.  I also enjoy connecting with other homeschooling (and hopefully <br/>
some unschooling) families around the US and further :)<br/>
<br/>
So, perhaps that would be a great way for your son to explore the US until <br/>
you&#39;re able to physically visit places.  He could collect specific types of <br/>
cards or cards from only certain states.<br/>
