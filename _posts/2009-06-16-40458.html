<div id="ygrps-yiv-682736080">I was reading an article this morning on the MSN homepage called &quot;Pick Happy&quot; how kids teach parents to enjoy simple things, it sounded a lot like unschooling.  On the radio I was listening to the news about a 4 year old girl who was killed accidently by a 89 year old woman who was driving (I didn&#39;t hear the details as to what exactly happened) and thinking to myself I am sooooo glad I am on the unschooling path.  Life is too short to live with limits, restrictions and worrying about the small stuff. <br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>
