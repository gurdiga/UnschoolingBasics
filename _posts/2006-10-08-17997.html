<div id="ygrps-yiv-1472423244">Hello List,<br/>
<br/>
has anybody heard/does anyone know anything about &quot;Sudbury Valley  <br/>
Schools&quot;? Starting this new German website and mailinglist of mine  <br/>
has caused Germans to write me and one of them suggested that Sudbury  <br/>
schools were the closest to Unschooling I could get under German law.<br/>
<br/>
Everything is decided democratically (everyone, teachers and students  <br/>
have a vote) in such schools and teaching only occurs upon request of  <br/>
children, otherwise it&#39;s just a learning environment in which the  <br/>
kids aren&#39;t forced to do anything. I guess I&#39;m wondering wether this  <br/>
can be unschooling, because I thought we&#39;re trying to find win-win- <br/>
solutions for all of the people involved, and in a democracy there is  <br/>
always at least one and in the worst case even 49,99% who don&#39;t get  <br/>
what they want and are just overrun. Yet they know in the next  <br/>
decission they might have more luck and so it&#39;s a bit of a compromise.<br/>
<br/>
Since there is even a Sudbury initiative in my town! I could imagine  <br/>
opting for that kind of school, as she has to go to school anyway.  <br/>
But I thought I&#39;d ask – maybe you knwo something horrible about it ;-)<br/>
<br/>

I&#39;ve heard a lot of positives about Sudbury Valley. It isn&#39;t as good  <br/>

school, that&#39;s the first place I&#39;d suggest she check out.<br/>

I&#39;ve heard a couple of negative experiences but it wasn&#39;t clear if   <br/>
the philosophy wasn&#39;t a good fit for them personally or because there  <br/>
was a personality clash with a particular mix of kids who were there  <br/>
one year.<br/>

<br/>
My thoughts are :  Is Sudbury school unschooling-perhaps, I know many <br/>
who would disagree and say if you are going to school you are not <br/>
unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
Does Sudbury school work in a &quot;consensual way&quot; (win-win), No it is <br/>
run democratically.  Although my disclaimer is that I have never been <br/>
to a Sudbury School, have only read about them, LOL.<br/>

go to a school in which she&#39;d have more freedom to learn. For we have  <br/>

work better than normal school is working now – for the moment she is  <br/>
complaining sometimes, but she still says she likes school and it&#39;s  <br/>
ok for her to go there. I don&#39;t overvalue it and she can stay at home  <br/>
if she wants to (although I didn&#39;t say that as a general &quot;rule&quot;).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1521337040">My daughter went for one year each at two different Sudbury schools and I<br/>
have to say that she really enjoyed her time there.  It was completely her<br/>
decision to go and she was welcome to unschool at anytime.  The schools were<br/>
completely different in atmosphere and I think her experience at the second<br/>
was probably freer, just due to the mix of staff and students.  Both were<br/>
very small schools, with attendance never going above about 15 kids and ages<br/>
ranged from 4 or 5 to mid teens.  She went to these schools in 2001-2002 and<br/>
2002-2003 when she was 8 and 9. <br/>
<br/>
I remember in the first one (in the Silicon Valley in California) there<br/>
being a little more emphasis on school meetings and chores, but Chloe liked<br/>
it all for some reason.  I actually would have preferred that she unschool<br/>
at that point, but her best homeschooling friends were going to that school,<br/>
so we let her finish out the year.  There was nothing required of the kids<br/>
besides their daily chore (which they got to choose and never bothered<br/>
Chloe) and their duty on the &quot;board&quot; which rotated so they weren&#39;t doing it<br/>
for more than a week at a time.  Otherwise they played on computers for<br/>
hours, played the piano, watched movies, jumped off an indoor loft, did arts<br/>
and crafts, cooked, and played outside a fair amount.  They did a few<br/>
walking trips to the main drag to get videos and treats, but didn&#39;t leave<br/>
the campus much.<br/>
<br/>
We moved the Maui after that and specifically searched out the Sudbury<br/>
school there because she enjoyed her time at the first school so much.<br/>
Everyone involved in that school, from staff to students and parents, was<br/>
much more on the &quot;hippie&quot; side of things.  This school was in a house, so<br/>
had a more home-like atmosphere.  The choice to go there was Chloe&#39;s, but it<br/>
really helped her in the move because she had instant friends.  <br/>
<br/>
I think this one was even more fun for Chloe.  She and the other kids played<br/>
outside and jumped on trampolines for hours.  They did all sorts of arts and<br/>
crafts projects which were just up her alley.  There was just a lot of play<br/>
going on, LEGO structures abounded and there were some kids who were always<br/>
building skateboard ramps and stuff like that.   They also took walks to a<br/>
local tourist stand for fruit and treats, and they took field trips to<br/>
waterfalls to jump off the rocks.<br/>
<br/>
When we moved back to the mainland we decided not to look for a place that<br/>
had a Sudbury school because that was too limiting for us (in choosing a<br/>
place to live).  We went back to unschooling as usual.  I think that Chloe<br/>
looks back on her time at the Sudbury schools fondly, especially the second<br/>
one.  Perhaps due to the location of that one, it seemed like an idyllic<br/>
year.  The worst part for me was the drive to get there (1/2 hour one way<br/>
for both schools).<br/>
<br/>
I would recommend that you check out the school and spend some time there<br/>
before making a decision.  What do the kids do?  What resources are<br/>
available?  What is the age range of the kids?  In both schools that Chloe<br/>
went to, the kids were required to try it for a week before fully<br/>
registering, so you can get an idea of the atmosphere.  If we had to choose<br/>
between public school and Sudbury with no possibility of unschooling, I<br/>
would definitely choose Sudbury at least to start with and let the child<br/>
decide if it works.  <br/>
<br/>
Feel free to email me off list if you have more questions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2092022689">I didn&#39;t know there was such a cool person - Joyce -<br/>
right near me - that is nice to know -<br/>
<br/>
We also live about 15 minutes away from Sudbury Valley<br/>
and my 15 y.o. stepson started going there just a few<br/>
weeks ago. He had been deschooling for a year after we<br/>
took him out of 7th grade, then tried highschool for<br/>
half a year, didn&#39;t like it but had lots of friends<br/>
over. So he left school again middle through 9th grade<br/>
(this in and out of school was a lot of hassle but we<br/>
wanted to value his decisions).<br/>
He started Sudbury Valley a few weeks ago and he says<br/>
he is never been happier. He just loves going there -<br/>
the first week or so he said he was mostly outside<br/>
climbing trees, the other day they caught and released<br/>
some frogs, he skateboards, cooks stuff, wants to<br/>
learn guitar now etc.<br/>
I think it depends on the situation and personality of<br/>
the kids, but if I had to send my kid to school this<br/>
would definately be it. He can go there at any time<br/>
and just has to commit to five hours a day five days a<br/>
week. He often stays longer and spends a lot of time<br/>
outside visiting friends he made there, or they come<br/>
to us.<br/>
He certainly is very happy and relaxed and it is the<br/>
perfect fit for him, as neither me with the little <br/>
boys around or his dad could fulfill those things<br/>
(lots of social interaction, beautiful land around, a<br/>
safe place to &#39;hang out with cool people for part of<br/>
the day&#39; that are not just family.<br/>
For my little ones I prefer them to be home. I am<br/>
hoping that when they get to be that age that I have<br/>
managed to find enough cool people to create our own<br/>
community that we are then part of that they won&#39;t be<br/>
lacking in loving and respectful people around them -<br/>
I don&#39;t know how much they allow or invite parental<br/>
involvement for the younger ones. I will go to the<br/>
open house this weekend and look around a bit since so<br/>
far, even with one son there, I have only seen it on<br/>
the outside. I could ask some specific questions if<br/>
you like, but their website also says a lot -<br/>
All the best,<br/>
Mara<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-698746815">Good luck with that Johanna!  Another thing I was thinking is I would ask<br/>
around with the staff and see what kinds of interests they have.  Do they<br/>
have similar interests as your child so that they can function as a mentor?<br/>
Or are they willing to try new things that a child may find interesting.  If<br/>
its a start up as you say, you will more likely have more input and maybe<br/>
other parents will be considered staff.  Chloe was lucky at Sudbury Maui<br/>
because all four staff members were artists.  She was able to use them all<br/>
as mentors so it was a great fit for her.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Oh, I didn&#39;t know that :D I thought that was a main part of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sole, there are many iterations of &quot;respectful parenting&quot; and &quot;mindful<br/>
parenting&quot;. Unschooling is commonly defined as not doing school in one<br/>
segment of the unschooling community. As a result, many people<br/>
wouldn&#39;t consider any type of school environment unschooling. However,<br/>
there are people who consider using workbooks and other schoolish<br/>
methodolgy, like homework and testing to be unschooling, if the child<br/>
is agreeable. <br/>
<br/>
There are many folks who lean toward incorporating the &quot;parenting&quot;<br/>
relationship into unschooling. This usually is what is referred to as<br/>
&quot;radical unschooling&quot;. When the parent &quot;allows&quot; the child to have<br/>
freedom over culturally derived &quot;parenting&quot; choices, like bedtimes,<br/>
food choices, tv viewing (quantity, selection, ratings, etc.). So,<br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; means a lot of different  things to a lot of different<br/>
people. You were briefly on the Consensual Living list where many of<br/>
us are radical unschoolers. But we find win-win solutions outside <br/>
and within our relationships with children. This may be the confusion.<br/>
Consensual living does believe that we can create win-win for<br/>
everyone, not just for children or parental relationships. I saw that<br/>
you asked about TCS also. TCS is an educational philosophy which<br/>
dictates that it is ammoral to coerce a child, and that it impairs<br/>
their learning. TCS is not embraced in this segment of the unschooling<br/>
community. TCS is a judgment paradigm that dictates a parent&#39;s<br/>
responsibility to optimize their child&#39;s learning. <br/>
<br/>
Consensual Living is not an educational philosophy. It is a philosophy<br/>
 and a process by which everyone&#39;s needs are equally valid, considered<br/>
and addressed to mutual agreement. Unschooling basically is not doing<br/>
school. <br/>
<br/>
I hope that helps to tease out the overlap and differences.<br/>
