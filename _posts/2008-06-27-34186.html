We have been unschooling our boys and working toward living a true RU <br/>
life, but lately I have been overwhelmed by guilt over how little I <br/>
know my oldest son.  We have made great strides in our relationship <br/>
in the last few months -- he is again allowing me to hug him and <br/>
wants me to cuddle with him at bedtime and throughout the day -- but <br/>
it seems that as things become better and better, I realize how bad <br/>
they were before and then I swarmed with guilt over all that I have <br/>
missed with him.  I wish I had paid more attention and enjoyed each <br/>
stage that he went through and I know that there is no way to go back <br/>
and do it again.  I do love him dearly -- he is awesome -- so <br/>
charming, thoughtful, empathetic, smart, curious, and full of <br/>
energy.  <br/>
<br/>
Ok, this is dragging on.  Has anyone dealt with these feelings of <br/>
guilt and regret?  Any ideas on how to move past it quickly and <br/>
positively?<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1804630028">I look at guilt this way:<br/>
<br/>
You feel guilty because you made a decision (consciously or not) and are now not sure of that decision.  Ask yourself- Can I change the decision?  If no, then let go/bless and release/stop beating yourself up.  If yes, then change your decision.<br/>
<br/>
You cannot change what is past, all you can do is make a new decision to enjoy the present.  Living with regrets prevents you from living fully and joyfully in the present.<br/>
<br/>
You said things are getting better...that is what you can focus on. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Only this:  Realize that every moment you spend feeling regret and <br/>
bad feelings about the past robs you and especially your kids of <br/>
happiness NOW.  You cannot change what has happened in the <br/>
past.  But, you *can* affect this moment now by not being present <br/>
now.  And, when you dwell in the past (and worry about the future), <br/>
you cannot be present now.  Now is where it&#39;s at!<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t sabotage the present by lingering in the past.<br/>
<br/>
Also, be grateful for the change that has brought you to where you <br/>
are now.  Perhaps you could not have appreciated this new way without <br/>
having experienced the old way.  Same with your sons; they may <br/>
appreciate the now-mom even more because they had a then-mom.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that helps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1348098517">You could view those feelings as a natural affirmation of the path you are<br/>
now on and make your way toward not seeing them as an indication that<br/>
something is wrong.  Guilt reveals strong wishes for a different way to<br/>
live, and also a pull back in the direction that what you know best.<br/>
Eventually the strength of guilt feelings will quieten a bit and that&#39;s when<br/>
you might revert to old habits.  The memory that you experienced them<br/>
strongly, though, could motivate you to avoid heaping on more.<br/>
<br/>
Keep building onto the things that are bright and good and sweet.  There are<br/>
two sides to every coin.  One of the best things I&#39;ve ever read that helped<br/>
me is to realize that in real life there many degrees to each event in daily<br/>
life:  Good, Bad, not so good, not so bad.  As long as you do more in the<br/>
&quot;good&quot; and &quot;not so bad&quot; categories, you&#39;ll be moving toward better.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t say there&#39;s an easy way to deal with guilt for unschooling sooner<br/>
but here&#39;s a great page of others who have dealt with it too and you&#39;re not<br/>
alone ... <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/ifonly">http://sandradodd.com/ifonly</a><br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1289116764">Diana,   <br/>
   Thanks for sharing that quote!   My husband is frequently consumed<br/>
by guilt because he has distanced himself from his emotional abusive<br/>
father. He feels he SHOULD love him and he does but he doesn&#39;t love<br/>
the behavior or the abuse or his father&#39;s denial of it therefore feels<br/>
guilty that he can&#39;t let it go and have a relationship.  I keep<br/>
pointing out that he is asking for emotionally healthy normal behavior<br/>
from someone incapable because he is not an emotionally healthy normal<br/>
 person.   Consequently we spend way too much time (in my opinion)<br/>
with him feeling like a bad person because he can&#39;t repair this<br/>
relationship.   I always feel like his dwelling on that damages the<br/>
relationship he is unable to have with his own children because of his<br/>
bad feelings/depression about his own childhood.    I have begged him<br/>
frequently to commit to being happy in the place he is.. not fretting<br/>
over what wasn&#39;t , what can&#39;t be and what may never be.   <br/>
We miss so much by dwelling on the past and not cherishing the present!<br/>

We have been unschooling our boys and working toward living a true RU<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Guilty&quot; is what a man says in court when his luck has run out. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Banish those thoughts and move on. They do NO ONE any good.<br/>
<br/>
Focus on what you have *now* and on what *more* you can do/be. <br/>
Understand that we only have so much time with our children and that we <br/>
don&#39;t get &quot;do-overs.&quot; Not really. I mean, they can be sweet and <br/>
generous and give us more chances to get it right, but the best thing <br/>
we can do is to *not* repeat our mistakes---to learn that we *can* do <br/>
better and then be sure to *do* better.<br/>
<br/>
Forget the guilt. BE the parent you want to be.<br/>
