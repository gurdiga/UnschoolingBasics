<div id="ygrps-yiv-143946576">Hi my name is Natalie we live in Durham, NC. Trinity just turned 5 <br/>
and BellaSky will be 2 in Sept. and we have one on the way due <br/>
sometime in Jan. I have been lurking for a month now. This group <br/>
feels very loving and supportive. <br/>
We learned abour RU before we moved here back in NJ from some RU <br/>
friends, and I was so interested and wanted to learn more. Trinity <br/>
was 3 at the time. They told us about the L&L conference and signed <br/>
up right away. I didn&#39;t know how to start it, implement, live it, do <br/>
it, be it. When we went to the conference, I felt like I found my <br/>
tribe which was a huge tribe.lol But then how do we tak that home. It <br/>
has been a wonderful jounrey since, so many gifts, so much healing, <br/>
so much joy. There are struggles but so much treasure we find when we <br/>
come out of it. Now I feel like I am more radical then my partner, so <br/>
I am on the journey of an unschooling relationship which is very <br/>
hard. He gets it, supports it, even be&#39;s it most of the time, but <br/>
when he is triggered so am I. We have a great relationship and are <br/>
commited to our journey seperatley, together and family. <br/>
Sorry this is getting long. <br/>
My question, Trinity has two friends who are sisters and go to school <br/>
and they live two houses away and she loves playing with them, but <br/>
they can be really mean sometimes and say things that Trinity <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be expose to. The one child lies alot and now Trinity is <br/>
starting to lie to me which she has never doen, and I don&#39;t know what <br/>
to do. She says when I ask, well Lea does it. I tell her how it makes <br/>
me feel and she doesn&#39;t want to. But I can&#39;t tell her she can&#39;t hang <br/>
out with them I think that should be her decision. But we are going <br/>
ot be here a while and so are they and they will only get older and <br/>
more things Trinity will be expose to that she wouldn&#39;t normally be. <br/>
I don&#39;t know how to handle this. I want to stay connected to Trinity <br/>
and I am scared our relationship will changed the more she hangs with <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for listening.<br/>
Be Well.<br/>
Natalie<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-714280460">I don&#39;t know if this will help you with your situation or not.  It&#39;s helping<br/>
me with a similar situation that happened with a family we&#39;ve known a long<br/>
time (years).  I&#39;m now reading Raising Our Children Raising Ourselves and<br/>
coincidentally I watched a youtube of the author Naomi Aldort speaking on a<br/>
topic... &quot;The Child is Right&quot; which was pretty eye opening for me about some<br/>
points of resistance I didn&#39;t see in myself.  Here&#39;s the link to that:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=H75gbkLvIRA">http://youtube.com/watch?v=H75gbkLvIRA</a> and if you&#39;re interested the book is<br/>
probably on amazon.com and/or some other online bookstores.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-210491089">I had a similar reaction to my first unschooling conference. I am  <br/>
almost finished reading &quot;Hold onto your kids&quot; by Gordon Neufeld, and I  <br/>
consider it a &quot;must read&quot; for all parents or caregivers of children of  <br/>
all ages. The book is all about the idea that parenting is a  <br/>
relationship between parent and child. He focuses on on the importance  <br/>
of nurturing the parent-child bond, and how that bond can be  <br/>
threatened by peers (because friends can&#39;t be expected to love  <br/>
unconditionally, and attachments to them can replace the primary  <br/>
parent-child attachment IF the primary attachment is insufficiently  <br/>
strong). He uses a number of examples including attachment issues he  <br/>
had with his own children. I found so much of what he says really  <br/>
resonated with me regarding my own childhood as well as my children. I  <br/>
mentioned Gordon Neufeld to a non-RU friend who is a family and  <br/>
marriage therapist. She recommended a couple of other authors that I  <br/>
have yet to rea; I am planning to borrow their books through my local  <br/>
public library. In case you are interested these authors are Daniel  <br/>
Hughes and Dan Seigel. The latter has a book called &quot;Parenting from  <br/>
the inside out&quot;. Hughes apparently includes tips to nurture the parent- <br/>
child attachment. My friend says she recommends the Seigel book to  <br/>
clients.  I was introduced to Neufeld on another unschooling forum by  <br/>
someone to whom I shall be eternally grateful.<br/>
<br/>
