<div id="ygrps-yiv-2092074273">so we&#39;ve been unschooling now since December 2005 (not very long)... did<br/>
school-at-home for the first few months of homeschooling starting in<br/>
September 2005... DD was in PS from K-3.  anyhow, the rule of thumb is one<br/>
month deschooling for every year in PS... all this time I&#39;ve been pretty<br/>
much letting her do whatever... and she&#39;s been anti-book/anti-library this<br/>
whole time...  today in the car on the way to church my DD starts talking<br/>
about the sign-language she knows and we talked a bit about it and I said I<br/>
could probably find some charts on the internet for her and she said &quot;we<br/>
could go to the library to get a book about it... then I could talk to<br/>
people who know sign-language.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
it was such a cool moment because it was all her... I didn&#39;t do a thing to<br/>
bring this conversation or idea on.  so as I was thinking about it I<br/>
realized that it&#39;s been about as many months as years as she was in PS...<br/>
and she&#39;s now pursuing interests beyond tv/video games 24/7 (though... don&#39;t<br/>
get me wrong... I have no problems with this 24/7)... it&#39;s just cool to see<br/>
her want to pursue an interest and an interest that I had no idea she had. <br/>
