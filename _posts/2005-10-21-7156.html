<div id="ygrps-yiv-1786961215">Just wanted to send in an update about what we did with your suggestions --<br/>
<br/>
Re: the money question I sent in a while ago, I decided to take out<br/>
the amount I needed to cover expenses and gave the boys the rest to<br/>
keep, no strings attached.  (Appreciate the person who posted about<br/>
that! :D) They were fine with that, didn&#39;t mind it.  DS8 bought<br/>
himself two games last time we went to GameStop.  He did the math he<br/>
needed and made the selective decision to buy two games instead of<br/>
just one with the amount of money he had.  Cheers to him for making<br/>
that step in thinking -- It&#39;s great to notice all those little steps<br/>
in growing and to cheer with the kids about it! :D<br/>
<br/>
re: the food issue -- I lost some of the original emails, especially<br/>
the personal ones when I had to close my pager service.  It is still a<br/>
problem for us because the kids want to eat different foods than I<br/>
can.  I&#39;m allergic to dairy so that influences some of our diet.  I<br/>
love Asian foods and the boys are decisively American in their tastes<br/>
- cheeseburgers, pizza, and the like.  So we have different meals<br/>
going on at once, and it&#39;s difficult keeping up my energy for that.<br/>
Lots of PB sandwiches on order sometimes.  I try to give them vitamins<br/>
and juices to make up for their lack of green intake and offer them<br/>
what&#39;s on my plate too.  They go to the food store with me and pick<br/>
out stuff as well.<br/>
<br/>
For a while they were eating cookies and candy for days on end.  I<br/>
tried changing to a once-weekly food store trip and portioning out the<br/>
cookies so they don&#39;t run out so fast.  Money IS tight.  But they<br/>
learned and slowed down a bit.  When they ask, I do offer something<br/>
little more healthier WITH the sugar.  Sometimes just the cookie.<br/>
It&#39;s an ongoing process.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll try looking in the archives for the comments again but someone<br/>
did send me a great email with different suggestions that I wish I<br/>
could have found and carried over before service quit.  I forgot who<br/>
did that as well, sigh.  Would you mind resending again?? :D<br/>
