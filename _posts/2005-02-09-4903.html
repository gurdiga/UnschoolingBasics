<div id="ygrps-yiv-18695556">Dear Hilary,<br/>
I&#39;m in a sort of similar boat, this is our 2nd year of homeschooling, <br/>
my daughter is 11 and son is 8.  I had no idea how much time it would <br/>
take to &quot;deschool,&quot; I think we&#39;re still recovering from the <br/>
experience.  You mentioned that some of the social aspects of school <br/>
were less than ideal.  If your son was exposed to any kind of <br/>
bullying - physical or psychological - this could also be <br/>
contributing to his moods.  And of course, there are plenty of what <br/>
my neighbor calls &quot;preteen moments.&quot; I&#39;ve done lots of reading to try <br/>
to understand my daughter&#39;s negative school experiences (ever read <br/>
about the hidden culture of aggression in girls?) and help her <br/>
overcome some of the depression and uncomfortable feelings.  My son <br/>
hates to write, and said he &quot;:hated learning&quot; at the end of the last <br/>
school year.  So I, too, have been swinging between &quot;should I push <br/>
it?&quot; and &quot;Let him get to it in his own time, don&#39;t put him off.&quot;  <br/>
I&#39;ve been trying to stay in the latter end of the swing, but it&#39;s <br/>
hard with that feeling that Big Brother is watching you.  I don&#39;t <br/>
have answers, just more questions, but I thought you might like to <br/>
know you&#39;re not the only one experiencing this and I have a feeling <br/>
it may be a normal reaction to the &quot;healing from school&quot; process.  If <br/>
it&#39;s any consolation, I think things have been getting easier - I&#39;ve <br/>
especially felt better since joining this group! It really does take <br/>
a long time, though.  I wish you the best.<br/>
