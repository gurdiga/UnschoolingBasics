<div id="ygrps-yiv-1957450343">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty new to this list, and to unschooling, having just begun <br/>
this endeavor with my son in his 8th grade year.  I have been <br/>
lurking here, following discussions, trying to gain pearls of wisdom <br/>
to help me open my mind to this very different way of thinking.  <br/>
Aaron (ds) led us to unschooling (he was unwilling and unable to put <br/>
up with school any longer, and our research of options led us here--<br/>
it was the ONLY option that made sense to Aaron)... it was not <br/>
something that I would have chosen for my children without having <br/>
been &quot;backed into the corner&quot; that we found ourselves in with Aaron, <br/>
because I work, I love to work and financially speaking, I need to <br/>
work.  Nevertheless, here I find myself, with an older daughter in <br/>
11th grade in public school, flourishing and happy and completely <br/>
overloaded with work and pressure unbefitting to any human being.... <br/>
yet she handles it and by &quot;normal&quot; standards is very successful... <br/>
and Aaron who looks at school as a complete waste of time (he has <br/>
always been wise beyond his years), and who is compelled towards <br/>
this very different approach, and completely and totally relieved <br/>
that he never has to go back to that awful, absurd place called <br/>
school (unless he chooses to).<br/>
And then there&#39;s me, who runs a very busy home-based business, who <br/>
works long hours (I am the chief bread-winner of the family...my <br/>
husband is a Middle School science teacher), and who feels very <br/>
conflicted, stressed out, worried that I really can&#39;t give Aaron the <br/>
attention that he deserves and needs as he embarks on this new <br/>
journey.  I find myself many times a day wanting to get him off the <br/>
computer, to get him to do something &quot;constructive&quot;... my mind <br/>
understands what unschooling is all about, but my automatic impulses <br/>
are quite strong and intact, and I have yet to find my trust in this <br/>
process.  I keep wanting Aaron to fit MY picture of what he should <br/>
be doing (I do try to control these impulses outwardly, I&#39;m just <br/>
describing the conflict that is going on inside of me).<br/>
I guess I&#39;m looking for some moral support from other parents, <br/>
particularly from parents with teens... particularly from parents <br/>
who have perhaps not been unschooling from &quot;day one&quot; and perhaps <br/>
have experienced some of this conflict.  Unlike many who post here, <br/>
I am not completely opposed to traditional schooling for some kids, <br/>
as flawed as it is.  It definitely works for my daughter, and as I <br/>
mentioned in another post, I couldn&#39;t pay her to leave school.  My <br/>
husband teaches very poor, inner city kids, whose parents do not <br/>
have the luxury of unschooling their children, who are barely <br/>
getting by, and whose kids desperately need a caring role model.  <br/>
School, as dysfunctional as it is, may be the only place where they <br/>
experience a spark of hope.   Some families for whom I have the <br/>
utmost respect and admiration send their children to public school, <br/>
and their kids are curious, full of life and brilliant, each in <br/>
their own way. I just don&#39;t think there are any  absolutes in this <br/>
world, and there is much to be learned in every  situation.<br/>
So, I&#39;m led down this new road by my wise, independent-thinking, <br/>
wonderful son, and I&#39;m having trouble letting go of the reigns and <br/>
of my old way of thinking.  Something in me doesn&#39;t WANT to let go <br/>
(yes, my kids will tell you I&#39;m a control freak)... yet I know that <br/>
I need to.<br/>
One more thing I&#39;d like to ask of anyone who wants to respond... <br/>
what do your teenage unschoolers do during their days?  I would very <br/>
much like to gather a mental picture &quot;gallery&quot; of days in the lives <br/>
of various unschooled teens, to help me to understand, accept, open <br/>
myself to possibilities, to find out where this journey can lead.<br/>
Sorry for the long post, and thanks for any thoughts.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-696185512">My 13 yod is on the computer for hours at a time, playing Neopets, writing,<br/>
working on web pages.  She also riders her bike and scooter, takes her<br/>
brother to the park, does numerous, various and sundry craft projects, reads<br/>
for hours, runs errands with me, or stays home with her brother, watches<br/>
some tv, but not a whole lot.  She is mostly self-directed, though we&#39;ll do<br/>
projects together and I&#39;m often needed as the resource person.  However, at<br/>
this age you can easily get a lot of work done at home while your teen does<br/>
his own thing.<br/>

<br/>
Sounds like you have a lot going on.  I&#39;m probably not the best one <br/>
here to answer you, but figured I would since we have a bit in <br/>
common.  I also have a 16yo daughter, 11th grade, AP program public <br/>
school, who is thriving.  My step-daughter, 14, 9th grade, public <br/>
school is choosing to fail.  We will be pulling her out after grades <br/>
are posted (need the proof for her mother)<br/>
<br/>
I am new to the unschooling which I have been doing for about two <br/>
months with my 8yo son with great results.  He is highly gifted and <br/>
just didn&#39;t fit the school mold.  Unschooling is perfect for him. <br/>
(And I guess we use the same thoughts for the others, they just <br/>
choose to be in school as they like the school.) As for the 14yo, I <br/>
am interested, also, to hear the answers.  We would be &#39;forcing&#39; her <br/>
out of public school as she would prefer to fail and just &#39;hang-out&#39; <br/>
for the social aspects.  <br/>

If you are &quot;forcing&quot; your stop-daughter to leave school, I expect you may have a tough row to hoe, as they say. I &quot;forced&quot; my older daughter out of the eight grade halfway through the year, but she was not failing. I found out what REALLY went on in the school, and it was not consistent with my value system, and then my daughter was involved in a retaliation incident against a boy accused of some major sexual harrassment against her best friend. (long story, dont need to go into it here, but suffice it to say I dont know how all that happened did so under the teachers nose) I thought I was doing what was best for her, and giving back control of her life to her, but she refused to get involved in homeschooling and became very depressed. There were some good things that came out of it, and I did like some of the positive changes I saw in her over the 7 months she was out of that environment, but her resistance to it was a major obstacle. I talked with other parents who had the same t<br/>
hing going on, meaning they decided to pull their teenagers out for various reasons against the teenagers wishes, and the ones that stuck it out said it took a very long time before the teenagers came around to unschooling or homeschooling voluntarily.

She just let them lay around for a year and then they realized that they owned their own lives (her words) and they got up and got motivated. So with your daughter, dont expect it to go smoothly if this is against her wishes. I am lucky that my current situation is different-my youngest daughter chooses to unschool so I am fortunate in that respect. I dont have any great advice for you, but you might try and involve your step-daughter as much as possible in deciding how she is going t<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-740844296">Thanks.  That&#39;s pretty much what I&#39;ve been saying, too.  It&#39;s her life and she needs to choose her path.  Her dad, my spouse, has told her that if she refuses to bring her grades up, he will put her in homeschool.  I see this as a problem for just the reasons you stated and she could make unschooling unpleasent for my 8yo who is enjoying it.<br/>
   <br/>
  I have tried to reason with her to get her to do something, but she just chooses to do nothing.  That&#39;s why she&#39;s failing.  It will be interesting to look back in a few years and see how it all pans out.  I have warned her that her father isn&#39;t kidding and where we live, unless we take the kids to meet other kids,  they are in total isolation.  The end of her social life as he won&#39;t let her online either.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1988677376">I am new to homeschooling (unschooling)as well.  This is our 2nd <br/>
week.  I just pulled them out of school. I do not have a teenager <br/>
but a 8yr old daughter and a 5yr son.  But I am struggling <br/>
with &quot;wrapping my head around&quot; the whole unschooling thing.  When I <br/>
read about it I understand and it makes a ton of sense.  But we are <br/>
so programed by the &#39;system&#39; that public school is the right way to <br/>
do things.  I know it works for a lot of kids out there but it also <br/>
fails a lot of kids.  It is so hard to trust that the kids will be <br/>
OK when they are not being forced to do math sheets and to follow a <br/>
curriculum.  That they will, on their own time, eventually find a <br/>
passion for learning and run with it. I have recently met a mother <br/>
who took her son out of school at age 10.  It took him 9 months to <br/>
deschool(play, do nothing, etc..) Now he is taking University <br/>
courses at age 15!  So we just have to wait and trust in our kids!  <br/>
Hard as it is.  When I get doubtful, either because of my own <br/>
thoughts or other peoples comments, I think of all the other <br/>
successful unschoolers out there.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck<br/>

We would be &#39;forcing&#39; her<br/>
out of public school as she would prefer to fail and just &#39;hang-out&#39;<br/>
for the social aspects.<br/>

Forcing a child to unchool is no better than forcing a child to go to <br/>
school.<br/>

<br/>
    Thanks.  That&#39;s pretty much what I&#39;ve been saying, too.  It&#39;s her <br/>
life and she<br/>
needs to choose her path.  Her dad, my spouse, has told her that if she <br/>
refuses<br/>
to bring her grades up, he will put her in homeschool.<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s an empty threat. Having her home woudln&#39;t make her grades go up <br/>
either. It *could* make her very resentful!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 I see this as a problem<br/>
for just the reasons you stated and she could make unschooling <br/>
unpleasent for my<br/>
8yo who is enjoying it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Not to mention *that*.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
   I have tried to reason with her to get her to do something, but she <br/>
just<br/>
chooses to do nothing.  That&#39;s why she&#39;s failing.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
What &quot;something&quot; do you think she needs to do?<br/>
<br/>
What do you think she&#39;s &quot;failing&quot; exactly? School? Socialization? Life?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 It will be interesting to<br/>
look back in a few years and see how it all pans out.  I have warned <br/>
her that<br/>
her father isn&#39;t kidding and where we live, unless we take the kids to <br/>
meet<br/>
other kids,  they are in total isolation.<br/>
<br/>
--=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
It IS a threat then.  She needs *more* options, not less. She&#39;s being <br/>
shut down at every turn. She has NOwhere to go. Nowhere at all.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re setting up a no-win situation. She&#39;s only going to get unhappier <br/>
and unhappier.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  The end of her social life as he won&#39;t let her online either.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Does he understand unschooling? AT this point in her life, the <br/>
socialization issue may be the ONLY thing that&#39;s important to her.<br/>
<br/>
Cutting *that* part of her life out too could cause her to shut down <br/>
completely.<br/>

He *does* need a lot of attention---but less than he might if he <br/>
weren&#39;t choosing this path. How much attention do you give him per day <br/>
*now* while he&#39;s IN school?<br/>
<br/>

 I find myself many times a day wanting to get him off the<br/>
computer, to get him to do something &quot;constructive&quot;...<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Uh oh. Please consider his compter time as VERY constructive! *MY* <br/>
computer time certainly is. Is yours???<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 my mind<br/>
understands what unschooling is all about, but my automatic impulses<br/>
are quite strong and intact, and I have yet to find my trust in this<br/>

<br/>
Cameron came out of a private college prep school at the end of sixth <br/>
grade with eight years there (pre-school and kindergarten). He spent 18 <br/>
months of doing &quot;nothing&quot; while deschooling. Now there are not enough <br/>
hours in the day for him to fit in all he wants to do! He&#39;s 18 and <br/>
loves his life!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  My husband teaches very poor, inner city kids, whose parents do not<br/>
have the luxury of unschooling their children, who are barely<br/>

School, as dysfunctional as it is, may be the only place where they<br/>
experience a spark of hope.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Yep---but that isn&#39;t our audience. Children in abusive, neglectful, <br/>
dysfunctional families may indeed find solace and inspiration in <br/>
school. We&#39;re not them. Our homes are overflowing with love and fun and <br/>
trust and respect and---well, all those things that they&#39;re NOT. I&#39;m <br/>
assuming you&#39;re not describing your home either.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;m led down this new road by my wise, independent-thinking,<br/>
wonderful son, and I&#39;m having trouble letting go of the reigns and<br/>
of my old way of thinking.  Something in me doesn&#39;t WANT to let go<br/>
(yes, my kids will tell you I&#39;m a control freak)... yet I know that<br/>
I need to.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yeah---Go control something else. They&#39;re are plenty of things out <br/>
there just begging to be controlled. I seek to control a conference and <br/>
my garden! Try NOT to aim that control at your kids! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
One more thing I&#39;d like to ask of anyone who wants to respond...<br/>
what do your teenage unschoolers do during their days?  I would very<br/>
much like to gather a mental picture &quot;gallery&quot; of days in the lives<br/>
of various unschooled teens, to help me to understand, accept, open<br/>
myself to possibilities, to find out where this journey can lead.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Today, Cameron helped me clean the garage out and set a few things <br/>
aside for Freecycle. He talked on the phone with his girlfriend, and I <br/>
helped her with a paper she&#39;s working on in college. He jumped on the <br/>
trampoline with his brother for a while---a lot of that time is spent <br/>
just sitting and talking too! &lt;g&gt; He played on the computer a bit---I <br/>
assume e-mailing friends---especially new ones from NBTSCamp. He <br/>
emptied the dishwasher and started a load of laundry. He&#39;s been playing <br/>
his drums since 1:00-ish. It&#39;s almost 5:00 now. He usually puts in 4-6 <br/>
hours/day on the drums when he can. He&#39;ll be in soon to help me wih <br/>
supper. We meant to start shagging (a SC dance for those who are <br/>
wondering! &lt;G&gt;) today, but haven&#39;t gotten around to it. (He learned <br/>
West Coast Swing at camp and has asked to learn how to shag and <br/>
waltz---we were going tot do that today, but haven&#39;t yet---maybe <br/>
later). He&#39;ll eat with us and probably get back on the computer this <br/>
evening. He&#39;s usually the first in bed every night unless he&#39;s playing <br/>
the drums for work---then he comes in after midnight.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday was more &quot;eventful&quot; since he just got back in town after a <br/>
week in Vermont. He was catching up on phone calls and doing a lot of <br/>
running around and making appointments.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s been gone most of these last six weeks. He house-sits a lot, so <br/>
he&#39;s often gone with that. He went to NBTSCamp in Oregon, came home and <br/>
left again for two weeks for the Albuquerque conference and our trip to <br/>
the Grand Canyon, came home and drove to Vermont for that NBTSCamp. <br/>
I&#39;ve missed him! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

It is so hard to trust that the kids will be<br/>

<br/>
Why?<br/>

I mean---really ask yourself WHY?<br/>
<br/>
Why would kids who are forced to do math sheets and follow a curriculum <br/>
be more OK than kids who are not? Why?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 That they will, on their own time, eventually find a<br/>
passion for learning and run with it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well, first of all, they are BORN with that passion for learning. <br/>
Schools (and often schools-at-home) suck it our of them.<br/>
<br/>
And many of us DO find that passion again---but usually in our <br/>
mid-thirties. Haven&#39;t you noticed the ages of folks in teh self-help <br/>
sections of bookstores and libraries? &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

Essentially he was healing. It only looks like playing and doing <br/>

Yeah--but it doesn&#39;t always look academic! Be prepared for anything!!!<br/>

I can&#39;t tell you how mind-boggling the teens at the Live and Learn <br/>
Unschooling Conference were/are!!!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s so much easier to trust in the process when there&#39;s some tangible <br/>
proof out there! We had a SLEW of them (teens and young adults) at the <br/>
conference! They are SOOO COOL!!!<br/>

&gt; fails a lot of kids.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling fails kids?  Hmmm.  I think that neglectful parenting<br/>
fails kids.  A mindful parent who is a partner with their child in<br/>
their goals will not fail a kid.  I hope you are taking time to<br/>
deschool yourself as well as your children.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; It is so hard to trust that the kids will be<br/>
&gt; OK when they are not being forced to do math sheets and to follow a<br/>
&gt; curriculum.  That they will, on their own time, eventually find a<br/>
&gt; passion for learning and run with it.<br/>
<br/>
That learning may not be what you have grown up thinking that learning<br/>
is.  It may look a lot like play or &quot;doing nothing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I have recently met a mother<br/>
&gt; who took her son out of school at age 10.  It took him 9 months to<br/>
&gt; deschool(play, do nothing, etc..) Now he is taking University<br/>
&gt; courses at age 15!<br/>
<br/>
Is this where he wants to be?  Or is this where he thinks he is<br/>
supposed to be?  :-D  Is this where he has been pushed to be?<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve yet to meet an &quot;Unschool drop out&quot;  IOW I have yet to meet a<br/>
young adult who was unschooled who is a total &quot;failure.&quot;  I&#39;ve had the<br/>
fortune of meeting some really cool  young adults who were unschooled<br/>
and they are living rich beautiful fulfilled lives.  They may not look<br/>
like &quot;successes&quot; through the eyes of a traditionally schooled person,<br/>
but they love their lives and are so happy pursuing their passions.<br/>
And I would say half of them never went to college.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m sorry. I thought you recently pulled him out of school. How much <br/>
time did you spend with him then? After school? Soccer practice?<br/>
<br/>
At his age, he should be able to self-entertain quite a bit.<br/>
<br/>
But he still needs *you* to provide transportation. He still needs to <br/>
bounce ideas off you. He still needs your involvement.<br/>

mean---if I&#39;ve been sitting all day, my body yells at me to get UP! Go <br/>
DO! Shake it OUT!  When I&#39;m out DOing for hours, it screams, &quot;STOP! <br/>
Slow DOWN! Take it EASY!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Happy people don&#39;t do destructive things.<br/>
<br/>
Check in with him often. Ask whether he needs a break. Give him a <br/>
massage. Take him some freshly baked cookies. Get a trampoline! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Make his life as wonderful and as welcoming as possible. He won&#39;t be <br/>
trying to *escape*---he&#39;ll be trying to get the most out of his life <br/>
instead. Keep nagging (assuming you do), and he will do his best to <br/>
retreat from you. Accept him and help him, and he&#39;ll ask you to join <br/>
him and be a part of it.<br/>

It would be even more encouraging if you met him. Just hearing about it <br/>
doesn&#39;t do him---or unschooling/deschooling---justice. Same for all he <br/>
other teens who are thriving. It&#39;s just amazing!<br/>
<br/>
And it almost wasn&#39;t like this! His life could have been just like all <br/>
his friends&#39; lives! I see it that we found unschooling just in time!!!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
No, I&#39;m not, but not all parents are cut out for this.<br/>

<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well, unfortuantely at his age, he doesn&#39;t have access to a car. He <br/>
NEEDS you. You may be right. THis might not work. But could you make <br/>
some changes? Could you change your work hours? Could you hire help? <br/>
What can *YOU* do to  make his work? What is Aaron willing to do?<br/>

-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Try not. Do or do not. There is no try.&quot;  ~Yoda   &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s doable. It may mean you have to give a few things up. Or tweak <br/>
things to fit sideways.<br/>
<br/>
But *just* trying won&#39;t do. Actually *doing* is what will work. Deep <br/>
breaths. Stopping and thinking before reacting involuntarily.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s *really* good that he can see you DOING at your work. Too often <br/>
children don&#39;t see parents DOING---they see things already DONE. <br/>
Like---MAGIC!<br/>
<br/>
Do you have the Teenage Liberation Handbook? Have you and he read it? <br/>
How about Rue Kreams&#39; Parenting a Free Child? Sandra Dodd&#39;s website? <br/>
Joyce Fetterroll&#39;s?<br/>
<br/>
See him as a whole person NOW---just making his way. Accept him As He <br/>
Is Now---and know that he will change and evolve as he grows. Step <br/>
back, and yet be *there* with him at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
None of this is easy. Easy is sending them to school and washing your <br/>
hands of them! &lt;g&gt; But the relationship is what&#39;s of major importance. <br/>
Losing your relationship with your son isn&#39;t worth whatever else you <br/>
think you might be losing.<br/>
<br/>
To whatever question you&#39;re struggling with---ask &quot;WHY?&quot; or &quot;WHY NOT?&quot;  <br/>
 Stop and think about it a bit. THEN make a decision.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

deschool(play, do nothing, etc..)<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Essentially he was healing. It only looks like playing and doing <br/>
nothing! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My son took 18 months. It&#39;s not a pleasant time!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Now he is taking University courses at age 15!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yeah--but it doesn&#39;t always look academic! Be prepared for anything!!!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
So we just have to wait and trust in our kids!<br/>
Hard as it is. When I get doubtful, either because of my own<br/>
thoughts or other peoples comments, I think of all the other<br/>
successful unschoolers out there.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t tell you how mind-boggling the teens at the Live and Learn <br/>
Unschooling Conference were/are!!!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s so much easier to trust in the process when there&#39;s some tangible <br/>
proof out there! We had a SLEW of them (teens and young adults) at the <br/>
conference! They are SOOO COOL!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-800572353">Once again, I totally agree.<br/>
   <br/>
  She is a smart girl.  She enjoys singing so I have tried hard to encourage her, which worked as she joined the drama class and loves it.  I bought her a piano which she loves to play.  I was going to sign her up for piano lessons that she real wants, but as I work 4-12 and she&#39;s in school 7-3, I can&#39;t get her there.  (weekends, she&#39;s at her mom&#39;s and she refuses.  Her mother has always refused to let her take classes.  Grandma even offer to pay for classes and her older sister, my daughter, offered to drive her her the lessons.<br/>
   <br/>
  Her Dad and Mom said no if she continued to fail her classes.  Piano lessons are a privilege not a right.  One earns privileges.   Hummm.  Needless to say, my spouse and I think differently.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I plan on getting her the harp she asked for, for Christmas.  I finally found a student harp that  I can afford.  She can&#39;t say why, she chooses to not do the assignments.  She just always has then at the last hour, does her work, and passes each year by the skin of her teeth!  Last year she went from a .82 to a 3.14 in four weeks.  So it&#39;s not that it&#39;s too hard  She is twice as smart as her class on the standardized testing yet average IQ they say.<br/>
   <br/>
  Lately, I&#39;ve sat down with her and told her, all her father can do is make the next four years miserable for all of us.  She can comply and he will give her freedom, or she can refuse and she&#39;ll be free when she&#39;s of age.<br/>
   <br/>
  I told her I see it differently.  My oldest, is taking classes I never had in college.  This is their time to learn to fly and still have us as their safety net.  I am here to help her discover and become what she would like to be whatever that is.  I can&#39;t do it for her.  I can only help.<br/>
   <br/>
  Needless to say, very frustrating.         <br/>

As you know, our situations are very similiar since this is my daughter&#39;s first year out of school. She watched her friends go off to High School and missed all the excitement of entering ninth grade. Now she is dealing with the fact that we are moving, which she does not want to do. Nevertheless, she has no interest in going back to school. Since I joined this list, I have found it within me to back off thinking I need to &quot;do&quot; anything to get her to &quot;do anything&quot; that meets anyone&#39;s criteria of whats &quot;constructive&quot; other than her own. I am on another list that is for homeschoolers and the ideas there are quite different than the ones here. <br/>
How does she spend her days? Sleeping. She stays up all night, and I mean all night, reading or manipulating photos in photoshop. She has read three books in the last two days. We are taking a Digital Photography class at the local community college (meets one night a week)  and now she wants to learn to SCUBA dive. I am so excited about that!! I can&#39;t wait!!<br/>
One thing that helps me see things differently is to keep my records in what someone called &quot;educationese&quot; or something to that effect. I downloaded some free software called HomeschoolTracker and I use it. I keep a reading list, enter field trips, make &quot;assignments&quot; out of stuff she does, for example if she says she read for three hours I enter it into the &quot;Free Reading&quot; assignments section. The software keeps track of all the hours spent doing things and when you look at the overview you see just how much &quot;nothing&quot; your kid is actually doing. And for some reason it satisfies the naysayers in my life. I showed it to my mother and now she is off my back about the whole thing. Funny how when you call something an &quot;assignment&quot; it takes on a whole new connotation. As if doing things you are told to do is somehow learning but doing things voluntarily is not. What a joke. And a sick one at that. <br/>

Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty new to this list, and to unschooling, having just begun <br/>
this endeavor with my son in his 8th grade year. I have been <br/>
lurking here, following discussions, trying to gain pearls of wisdom <br/>
to help me open my mind to this very different way of thinking. <br/>
Aaron (ds) led us to unschooling (he was unwilling and unable to put <br/>
up with school any longer, and our research of options led us here--<br/>
it was the ONLY option that made sense to Aaron)... it was not <br/>
something that I would have chosen for my children without having <br/>
been &quot;backed into the corner&quot; that we found ourselves in with Aaron, <br/>
because I work, I love to work and financially speaking, I need to <br/>
work. Nevertheless, here I find myself, with an older daughter in <br/>
11th grade in public school, flourishing and happy and completely <br/>
overloaded with work and pressure unbefitting to any human being.... <br/>
yet she handles it and by &quot;normal&quot; standards is very successful... <br/>
and Aaron who looks at school as a complete waste of time (he has <br/>
always been wise beyond his years), and who is compelled towards <br/>
this very different approach, and completely and totally relieved <br/>
that he never has to go back to that awful, absurd place called <br/>
school (unless he chooses to).<br/>
And then there&#39;s me, who runs a very busy home-based business, who <br/>
works long hours (I am the chief bread-winner of the family...my <br/>
husband is a Middle School science teacher), and who feels very <br/>
conflicted, stressed out, worried that I really can&#39;t give Aaron the <br/>
attention that he deserves and needs as he embarks on this new <br/>
journey. I find myself many times a day wanting to get him off the <br/>
computer, to get him to do something &quot;constructive&quot;... my mind <br/>
understands what unschooling is all about, but my automatic impulses <br/>
are quite strong and intact, and I have yet to find my trust in this <br/>
process. I keep wanting Aaron to fit MY picture of what he should <br/>
be doing (I do try to control these impulses outwardly, I&#39;m just <br/>
describing the conflict that is going on inside of me).<br/>
I guess I&#39;m looking for some moral support from other parents, <br/>
particularly from parents with teens... particularly from parents <br/>
who have perhaps not been unschooling from &quot;day one&quot; and perhaps <br/>
have experienced some of this conflict. Unlike many who post here, <br/>
I am not completely opposed to traditional schooling for some kids, <br/>
as flawed as it is. It definitely works for my daughter, and as I <br/>
mentioned in another post, I couldn&#39;t pay her to leave school. My <br/>
husband teaches very poor, inner city kids, whose parents do not <br/>
have the luxury of unschooling their children, who are barely <br/>
getting by, and whose kids desperately need a caring role model. <br/>
School, as dysfunctional as it is, may be the only place where they <br/>
experience a spark of hope. Some families for whom I have the <br/>
utmost respect and admiration send their children to public school, <br/>
and their kids are curious, full of life and brilliant, each in <br/>
their own way. I just don&#39;t think there are any absolutes in this <br/>
world, and there is much to be learned in every situation.<br/>
So, I&#39;m led down this new road by my wise, independent-thinking, <br/>
wonderful son, and I&#39;m having trouble letting go of the reigns and <br/>
of my old way of thinking. Something in me doesn&#39;t WANT to let go <br/>
(yes, my kids will tell you I&#39;m a control freak)... yet I know that <br/>
I need to.<br/>
One more thing I&#39;d like to ask of anyone who wants to respond... <br/>
what do your teenage unschoolers do during their days? I would very <br/>
much like to gather a mental picture &quot;gallery&quot; of days in the lives <br/>
of various unschooled teens, to help me to understand, accept, open <br/>
myself to possibilities, to find out where this journey can lead.<br/>
Sorry for the long post, and thanks for any thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
Linda<br/>

<br/>
You have probably already found or been offered these links but I&#39;ll post<br/>
them again because there&#39;s so much information at both places.<br/>
www.sandradodd.com/unschooling<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/">http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/</a><br/>
<br/>
*** and who feels very<br/>

attention that he deserves and needs as he embarks on this new<br/>
journey. ***<br/>
<br/>
Your stress levels will decrease as you grow more confident about<br/>
unschooling.  But as to time with Aaron, weren&#39;t you committed to time with<br/>
him before you took him out of school?   Wasn&#39;t his unhappiness at school a<br/>
source of stress for you?  How did you cope then?<br/>
These aren&#39;t questions you need to answer on the list but just consider the<br/>
possibilities in your life for these or different changes:<br/>
Can you work at least part of your shift while he&#39;s asleep in the AM or PM?<br/>
Can you work when his father is home to hang out with him?<br/>
Can you work in chunks, taking time through out the day to do something with<br/>
him, go for a walk, play video games, etc. ?<br/>
Can you change your hours or get help in order to spend more time with him?<br/>
Can you changes jobs?<br/>
Can you quit your job or cut back hours?<br/>
Can your husband quit or cut back or change?<br/>
Can your son have a friend over for at least part of your work day?<br/>
Can he go to the house of a friend for part of a work day a couple times a<br/>
week?<br/>
Is there an Aunt or Uncle or trusted friend who&#39;d take him fun places one or<br/>
two days a week?<br/>
<br/>
***I find myself many times a day wanting to get him off the<br/>
computer, to get him to do something &quot;constructive&quot;... my mind<br/>
understands what unschooling is all about, but my automatic impulses<br/>
are quite strong and intact, and I have yet to find my trust in this<br/>
process. I keep wanting Aaron to fit MY picture of what he should<br/>
be doing (I do try to control these impulses outwardly, I&#39;m just<br/>
describing the conflict that is going on inside of me).***<br/>
<br/>
He needs time to heal from the injuries of school.  You&#39;ve probably read<br/>
about deschooling.  Some people have talked about one month of deschooling<br/>
for every year the child was in school but I&#39;ve never thought that was<br/>
enough.  Maybe I&#39;m slow. &lt;G&gt;  I think it&#39;s possible or even likely some or<br/>
even lots of kids take much longer to heal. (that was messy but I hope you <br/>
know what I mean.)<br/>
<br/>
Resist letting your concerns spill out onto him.<br/>
<br/>
Be with him as much as he wants you to be.   Take an interest<br/>
in whatever he&#39;s doing.  Sit down with him while he&#39;s on the computer and<br/>
try to see it from his perspective.  He&#39;s getting something out of it he<br/>
needs right now.  Let that comfort you.<br/>
<br/>
***I guess I&#39;m looking for some moral support from other parents,<br/>
particularly from parents with teens... particularly from parents<br/>
who have perhaps not been unschooling from &quot;day one&quot; and perhaps<br/>
have experienced some of this conflict.***<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m the mom of a teen boy.  Dylan is fourteen.<br/>
<br/>
What Aaron is doing today is not all he&#39;ll ever do.  Relax your whole body<br/>
and tell yourself that.  Let is settle.  He might very well always like<br/>
computers.  They&#39;re common household and work place appliances and all of us<br/>
on this list have at least some interest in them. &lt;g&gt;  He might not always<br/>
have the deep interest he has today but if he does, that might lead him to a<br/>
job or hobby he loves and isn&#39;t part of your hope for him that he will find<br/>
what he loves to do?<br/>
<br/>
People have changing interests their whole lives long.   A parent may not be <br/>
able to<br/>
see where her kid&#39;s interest might end or if it doesn&#39;t end where it might<br/>
take him but that doesn&#39;t lessen the value of his experience today.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t always have to understand what our kids are getting from their<br/>
interests.   But in loving our kids and in respecting their intelligence we<br/>
can get comfortable knowing they are pursuing something that&#39;s important to<br/>
them.   Your son&#39;s reasons for loving the computer right now aren&#39;t less<br/>
important than your reasons for loving your job, or sewing or carpentry - or <br/>
whatever your passion<br/>
might be.<br/>
<br/>
This is not all he&#39;ll ever be.   Haven&#39;t some of his interests changed since <br/>
he was three?  Since he was seven?  Since he was ten?<br/>
Do you fear he will be thirty five and still at home with you on the <br/>
computer? &lt;g&gt;  It sounds kind of silly, but a lot of people have those <br/>
feelings.  The &quot;what about when he&#39;s twenty&quot; feelings.<br/>
<br/>
Dylan nursed until he was four.   Lots of kids nurse longer but no one who <br/>
knew us ever knew a child to nurse as long as four years.  I would hear <br/>
those irrational fear based questions from friends and family: &quot;What are you <br/>
going to do when he&#39;s still nursing at eighteen?&quot;   I would say, &quot;Get a <br/>
bigger rocking chair.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They could only see two possibilities.  Either I stop him from nursing or he <br/>
would never stop.  Either I do this or he will never do that.<br/>
<br/>
And so always remember that there are more possibilities than *Either you <br/>
stop your son from playing on the computer or he will never do anything <br/>
else. *<br/>
<br/>
There is the possibility that he will play until he&#39;s finished.  There is <br/>
the possibility that his enjoyment will lead to a joyful hobby or career. <br/>
There is the possibility that through his play he will find other interests. <br/>
There is the possibility, if you embrace his interest too, your relationship <br/>
will grow and strengthen.  There is the possibility he&#39;ll lose interest and <br/>
move on to something else in a year.  The possibilities are endless.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
***Unlike many who post here,<br/>
I am not completely opposed to traditional schooling for some kids,<br/>
as flawed as it is. ***<br/>
<br/>
Even in a fairly happy school scenario kids can but injured in ways that<br/>
don&#39;t always show on the surface.   This isn&#39;t a school bashing list but the<br/>
simple fact most parents willingly comply with the law and separate from<br/>
their very little children to let them be with strangers for three or six<br/>
hours a day is evidence that school alters our judgment and undermines our<br/>
confidence in ways we aren&#39;t aware of many years later as adults.<br/>
<br/>
***One more thing I&#39;d like to ask of anyone who wants to respond...<br/>
what do your teenage unschoolers do during their days? ***<br/>
<br/>
The only people who respond to you on this list will be the ones who want<br/>
to. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My son is making his way through several screenwriting books he&#39;s purchased<br/>
recently or received as gifts.  He&#39;s on book two now.  The first one he read <br/>
was &quot;Story&quot; by Robert McKee.  It sort of irritated him. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
The one he&#39;s reading now is &quot;Elements of Style for Screenwriters&quot; by Paul <br/>
Argentini. He&#39;s interested in<br/>
screenwriting and directing.  He watches movies and pays attention to the<br/>
directing style, camera angles, etc.  He watches a couple of movies a day, <br/>
lately.   He<br/>
researches directors and movies online.  He&#39;s interested in camera angles<br/>
and film techniques.  He watches documentaries about film making and film<br/>
makers.   He reads books about these things he&#39;s interested in.  He&#39;s <br/>
reading Stephen King&#39;s &quot;Danse Macabre.&quot;<br/>
He listens to jazz.  He pays attention to politics and<br/>
international news.  He subscribes to and reads a weekly political magazine. <br/>
He likes comedy and watches a couple of political<br/>
comedy shows.  He&#39;s reading Howard Zinn&#39;s &quot;A People&#39;s History of the United <br/>
States.&quot;<br/>
He&#39;s reading &quot;The Year of the Angry Rabbit&quot; by Russell Braddon - an odd <br/>
political humor/horror story.<br/>
He splits kindling for his grandmother three or four times a<br/>
week.  He draws cartoons.  He&#39;s working on an idea for a line of dark humor<br/>
greeting cards.   He&#39;s away on a road trip with his aunt, into Alberta and<br/>
British Columbia right now.  He likes to stay up late and sometimes all <br/>
night.  He likes to walk at night so we go for a walk after dark every night <br/>
with few exceptions.  He&#39;s annoyed by the curfew laws that say he can&#39;t be <br/>
out alone after ten oclock.  He likes to hike so we go hiking at least once <br/>
a week.   He hangs out at the bookstore one day a week and visits with the <br/>
owners and with the local &quot;Character&quot; to talk about politics and social <br/>
issues.  He plays cribbage with his dad.  He kicks my ass at chess.  (would <br/>
it kill him to let me win one game?? &lt;BEG&gt;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1386662398">***The body wants to keep doing what it&#39;s already doing... ***<br/>
<br/>
I thought you didn&#39;t believe in absolutes! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Think about this.   If a body wants to keep doing what it&#39;s doing, why is <br/>
that?  Mightn&#39;t there be a need?  What would make it so?<br/>
<br/>
***and sometimes  computer time can become excessive and pointless just <br/>
because I&#39;m<br/>
too lazy to get up and do something else... ***<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe you just needed a little down time.  Time to let your mind unwind. <br/>
When people need down time and they take a nap or go to bed early or go get <br/>
a massage, or take a long bath, we consider those to be healthy choices made <br/>
by people who are listening to their own bodies.<br/>
<br/>
But society has a negative view of TV and video games and computers in that <br/>
unless one is doing something that qualifies as &quot;work&quot; then one is wasting <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
*** But people do do destructive things, don&#39;t they? ***<br/>
<br/>
What kind of people do destructive things?   This is another one of those <br/>
questions that isn&#39;t necessary for you to answer on the list but to ponder <br/>
yourself.  Is your son at risk of being self destructive?   Are you thinking <br/>
rationally or are you letting fear take hold of you?   Is living with fear <br/>
constructive or destructive?<br/>
<br/>
***Do I just let my son continue whatever direction he&#39;s going, even if<br/>
it&#39;s leading him down a path the I see as not too great for him?***<br/>
<br/>
First, your son is playing computer games, he&#39;s not organizing hookers and <br/>
gambling rings or stealing cars.   Try to keep your perspective.<br/>
Games.   He is not doing anything destructive and instead of trying to <br/>
change his direction you could go there with him.  Then you might see it is <br/>
not the road to hell, it&#39;s a young man&#39;s interest.  An interest he shares <br/>
with many other people who are just fine.   Join him!  Your fears will <br/>
subside.<br/>
<br/>
But what else is available to him?   Does he have choices about what to do <br/>
with his time.  Can he go see friends?  Can he go to the book stores or <br/>
museums or art galleries or gaming shops?  Can he watch TV or movies?   Can <br/>
he have friends over?  Can he spend time with you?  Can he go places and <br/>
meet people?   Could he join a club or group if he wanted - rock climbing or <br/>
ski club or karate?<br/>
<br/>
If he has many choices and he&#39;s choosing computer games then he&#39;s doing what <br/>
he wants to do right now.   If the computer is his only or best choice then <br/>
*you* are not doing enough to make his world big and interesting.  That is <br/>
not a fault with your child and not a problem with the computer.  If the <br/>
computer is his only choice and you take it away from him what do you leave <br/>
him with?   Resentment, boredom, loneliness.   If the computer is his best <br/>
choice then he&#39;d be a fool not to use it.   What are you doing to make his <br/>
world big and interesting?<br/>
<br/>
***This is where I go crazy, not knowing what to do as a parent.***<br/>
<br/>
This doesn&#39;t have to be agonizing.   Think about good and right ways to <br/>
treat people and apply that to your kid.   If a dear friend was healthy and <br/>
happy but spent many hours making quilts would you be wondering if she was <br/>
headed down the path of destruction? &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
  Next he worked for a caterer---again, someone we knew. Again, their <br/>
best worker.<br/>
<br/>
  He left there as a full time employee and worked only two days/week <br/>
because he got a job delivering a local paper. Again---best worker! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  He volunteered at the local independent movie theatre for a year. Then <br/>
one of the managers left for five months to go to Australia. Cam was <br/>
hired to temporarily replace him until he recently came back.<br/>
<br/>
  He started his own pet-sitting service. He still does this and has <br/>
over a dozen very regular clients. He stays overnight in their homes <br/>
and cares for the animals and plants, etc. This is by far his biggest <br/>
source of $$$.<br/>
<br/>
  For years he has gone to &quot;Open Mike Night&quot; at two bars in town. I had <br/>
to go with him to get him in until they knew him and knew he was <br/>
serious. At 17, he was a regular. At 18, one of the clubs hired him as <br/>
the house band&#39;s drummer (Fatback and the Groove Band). He&#39;s a <br/>
professional musician now! &lt;G&gt; He plays blues, jazz, and old pop.<br/>
<br/>
  The band he formed (Half Moon Blessing---check out their MySpace) has <br/>
had two paying gigs and are looking for more. They need a longer set. <br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 He plays the drums 4-6 hours each day.<br/>
<br/>
  He was recently asked to work for a guy (family friend of the <br/>
girlfriend) who needs a driver for his business. We&#39;re not quite sure <br/>
what he&#39;ll be doing, but it&#39;s $10-11/hour.<br/>
<br/>
  He also has been helping a friend with some serious <br/>
remodeling---scraping popcorn ceilings, landscaping, cleaning, painting <br/>
inside & out. THis friend is also a *TALKATIVE* sociology professor at <br/>
the university. Essentially, he&#39;s paying Cam $10/hour to lecture him <br/>
about sociology. Cam LOVES it! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Most of his friends are in college or have an apartment. I&#39;ve told him <br/>
we would be happy to help him move out (pay first month, furnish with <br/>
what we have in storage, etc.), but he&#39;d rather keep saving for a newer <br/>
car (that can fit his drums!) and have $$ to spend on the girlfriend. <br/>
He helped pay for NBTSCamp and the upcoming Drumming Collective (in NYC <br/>
in November) with the $$ he&#39;s made and saved. His car is paid for, but <br/>
he covers his insurance and gas and repairs, etc. At 18, I think that&#39;s <br/>
enough.<br/>
<br/>
 He&#39;s pretty generous with his $$, but he *really* likes to save it! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  He could *be* more independent, but we&#39;ve suggested that he keep <br/>
working and keep saving and keep living with us. If he puts the time <br/>
and effort into his drumming these next four years that his friends are <br/>
in college, he&#39;ll be *more* prepared than they will! &lt;G&gt; He makes <br/>
enough $$ that he *could* live on his own, but that&#39;s not the meager <br/>
existence I want for him. I&#39;d rather his life be rich and abundant. I <br/>
can still give that to him. I don&#39;t want him to think of himself as a <br/>
&quot;starving artist.&quot; He can be *just* as good a musician with a full <br/>
stomach and a warm, dry home! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I have NO doubts he will make it alone. He could do it now. But I like <br/>
having him around!<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;But as to time with Aaron, weren&#39;t you committed to time with<br/>
him before you took him out of school?   Wasn&#39;t his unhappiness at <br/>
school a source of stress for you?  How did you cope then?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a matter of coping... it&#39;s a matter of meeting his needs.  <br/>
His needs are different now that he is not in school.  We&#39;re still <br/>
finding our way together, so that both of us have our needs met, but <br/>
it&#39;s OK, it&#39;s a good search--- I&#39;m not asking for advice on this.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

changes:&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, your exact list of questions don&#39;t really apply to our <br/>
situation, but I get what you&#39;re saying--to think outside the usual <br/>
box.  Believe me, what we are doing is way outside the box we were <br/>
in!  I think we have already made many changes, both outwardly and <br/>
inwardly.  And I think we&#39;re on the right track.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Deb, for such a long and thoughtful response.  I enjoyed <br/>
hearing about your son, and I am glad to be reminded that my son <br/>
will probably not end up having his computer surgically attached to <br/>
his body. Even now he does occasionally retreat from the computer to <br/>
jump on the trampoline, play his bass, go to chess club and computer <br/>
animation club... get tutored by his favorite teacher in the <br/>
universe, etc..... He just left for a sleepover with three great  <br/>
friends, SO WHY DO I FRET SO MUCH??   LOL.</div>

That was someone else---my topic got high jacked a little to a side <br/>
discussion between two other people.  A little confusing. (but <br/>
actually I don&#39;t think much of absolutes either)<br/>

&quot;Try to keep your perspective.<br/>

idiot when it comes to these strategy role-playing games.  But I do <br/>
sit and watch and listen. And last week I found a puzzle game that <br/>
we both really enjoyed--EXTREMELY challenging... of course he had <br/>
almost all of them figured out in no time--I figured out <br/>
some...here&#39;s the link for anyone interested:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://click-drag-type-3.freeonlinegames.com/">http://click-drag-type-3.freeonlinegames.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;But what else is available to him?   Does he have choices about <br/>
what to do <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; with his time.  Can he go see friends?  Can he go to the book <br/>
 </span></blockquote>stores or <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; museums or art galleries or gaming shops?  Can he watch TV or <br/>
 </span></blockquote>movies?   Can <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; he have friends over?  Can he spend time with you?  Can he go <br/>
 </span></blockquote>places and <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; meet people?   Could he join a club or group if he wanted - rock <br/>
 </span></blockquote>climbing or <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ski club or karate?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, all of the above.  Always, for both kids schooled or <br/>
unschooled.  (If anything, I&#39;m the one who needs more of the above!)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What are you doing to make his world big and interesting?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is food for thought... maybe not quite enough so far in terms <br/>
of things that he and I do together.  I have to think about this one.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, that&#39;s enough advice for now... I have a lot of homework!!  <br/>
I&#39;ll post again when needed, meanwhile back to lurking.  Thanks to <br/>
everyone who responded.<br/>

   Her Dad and Mom said no if she continued to fail her classes.  Piano <br/>
lessons<br/>
are a privilege not a right.  One earns privileges.   Hummm.  Needless <br/>
to say,<br/>
my spouse and I think differently.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Is he on board with unschooling your other child? Why not his older <br/>
daughter?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=--=-<br/>
<br/>
   Lately, I&#39;ve sat down with her and told her, all her father can do is <br/>
make the<br/>
next four years miserable for all of us.  She can comply and he will <br/>
give her<br/>
freedom, or she can refuse and she&#39;ll be free when she&#39;s of age.<br/>
<br/>
--=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve given this advice to teens not my own---who were in dutch with <br/>
their parents and in need of a shoulder/safe place to vent. Just do <br/>
what you can and wait it out.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s NOT *all* he can do. That&#39;s a lie. He *CAN* and *should* do <br/>
a LOT more than make the next four years miserable for her. Is that his <br/>
GOAL???<br/>
<br/>
Is that what you and your younger child have to look forward to?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be out of there so fast....<br/>

published author of children&#39;s books, one is a freelance photographer<br/>
who does wedding photographs and also movie stills, and the third is<br/>
in the entertainment business currently working for  Disney in an<br/>
international program.  They are all (what I consider) young (under<br/>
30).   They are all pursuing their passions and unhindered by<br/>
&quot;shoulds.&quot;  Another friend has two young adult unschooled children.<br/>
One is currently in college (can&#39;t remember what she is studying) and<br/>
the other just finished a 6 year stint in the Navy.  Now he works<br/>
doing something similar to what he did in the Navy and going out with<br/>
his girlfriend as much as possible.  :)<br/>
<br/>
My oldest child has recently been thinking about &quot;what she wants to do<br/>
when she grows up&quot; and while she hasn&#39;t pinpointed it exactly yet, she<br/>
knows it will have something to do with Japan.  She is thinking along<br/>
the lines of being an instructor of English in Japan or working in the<br/>
corporate world as an English/Japanese translator or perhaps something<br/>
to do with diplomacy.  It&#39;s exciting watching her go through this<br/>
thought process!<br/>
