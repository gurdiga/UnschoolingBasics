<div id="ygrps-yiv-1001810029">Can someone help me understand more about un-schooling? I am currently in a virtual charter school but feel too restricted by the curriculum and requirements. This is our second year and I feel ready to venture out on my own. I have looked at several of the South Carolina homeschool associations. This one on un-schooling seems to best fit my personal philosophy but until today I have never heard of it. I would appreciate some input and direction. Thanks so much, Cindy Woods</div>
