<div id="ygrps-yiv-1390965840">Oh yea...on a second note...I know that most people don&#39;t understand unschooling...let alone homeschooling.  I have a friend who completely believes in the public school system even though her 9 yr old this year has turned into a complete jerk--including his attitude towards his teacher, me as his daycare provider, his bus driver and his parents.  But, she still reasons with herself and says that ps is the right thing for their family.  Their 5 yr old boy started K this year and is the same way....huge attitude.

  I guess the ruling is still out on this one.  A lot of people on this board and others are up in arms thinking the show was terrible.  Maybe it was and I&#39;m not seeing it.  Knowing that these types of shows (Dr. Phil, Oprah, etc.) are all about Ratings and Sensationalism, I expected the worst.  I was pleasantly surprised that they actually presented both sides, and the homeschoolers/unschoolers were not totally blasted.  I have seen Dr. Phil totally brow beat people in the past, and because of it I had stopped watching his show.  Anyway at the end of the show they had this 26 year old gal on that had been homeschooled, and she was anti-homeschooling.  She said it made her socially retarded, and that she to this day was afraid to go to College because she had never been exposed to a classroom type setting.  Well I had to wonder what the rest of the story was on that one.  The homeschooled teens I know where we live are involved in sports, clubs, going to homeschool proms,<br/>
 teen groups, 4-H, oh the list goes on and on........these kids are not socially retarded by any stretch.  And another woman made the point that homeschooling does not mean some kind of reclusive, hidden in a cave lifestyle.  Actually that last bit I thought was the most negative thing about the whole segment. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-681816428">That&#39;s exactly what I mean.  My friend doesn&#39;t look down on me for homeschooling but she certainly doesn&#39;t support it and probably never will.  Only because she&#39;s ignorant about it.  We both have mutual friends and I&#39;d say that over 1/2 of our mutual friends are homeschoolers.  She&#39;s the only one out of the group that has said she completely refuses to ever consider homeschooling because the ps system does a better job.  And it&#39;s not that she&#39;s not &quot;qualified&quot;, she&#39;s extremely smart and has a college degree, she just doesn&#39;t want to consider it as an option....ever.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-703862363">The 26 yr old must have been pretty sheltered then or have some self-esteem issues then.  I can&#39;t see how anyone homeschooled would consider themselves socially retarded unless they just never interacted with anyone....ever.  <br/>
<br/>
My kids are only 9 and 5 and are the most outgoing kids I&#39;ve ever seen.  They have their normal hang-ups about walking up to a stranger (say the person behind the counter at the bookstore) to ask them a question, but I make them do it anyway on their own so they know how to speak to adults and ask the questions they need to get through life and everyday activities.<br/>
<br/>
It makes you wonder if that gal from the show ever attended any kind of class setting....whether it be Sunday school or a homeschool conference meeting.  Sounds very strange that she would say homeschooling made her socially retarded.  Like I said before, there has to be more behind her life story leading her to be so scared of a college setting.  Very sad really that her parents didn&#39;t prepare her better for life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-296765208">Exactly, there is definately more to that story than is not being told.  I personally think it&#39;s a personal issue with her, not a homeschool issue.

It makes you wonder if that gal from the show ever attended any kind of class setting....whether it be Sunday school or a homeschool conference meeting.

I guess the ruling is still out on this one. A lot of people on this board and others are up in arms thinking the show was terrible. Maybe it was and I&#39;m not seeing it. Knowing that these types of shows (Dr. Phil, Oprah, etc.) are all about Ratings and Sensationalism, I expected the worst. I was pleasantly surprised that they actually presented both sides, and the homeschoolers/unschoolers were not totally blasted. I have seen Dr. Phil totally brow beat people in the past, and because of it I had stopped watching his show. Anyway at the end of the show they had this 26 year old gal on that had been homeschooled, and she was anti-homeschooling. She said it made her socially retarded, and that she to this day was afraid to go to College because she had never been exposed to a classroom type setting. Well I had to wonder what the rest of the story was on that one. The homeschooled teens I know where we live are involved in sports, clubs, going to homeschool proms,<br/>
teen groups, 4-H, oh the list goes on and on........these kids are not socially retarded by any stretch. And another woman made the point that homeschooling does not mean some kind of reclusive, hidden in a cave lifestyle. Actually that last bit I thought was the most negative thing about the whole segment. <br/>

<br/>
I was expecting it to be totally Anti-Homeschooling/Unschooling, and <br/>
it really was not. Of course in any type of show like this they <br/>
have to give views of all sides. But I thought it put a positive <br/>
spin on Homeschooling and Unschooling. I think though the thing <br/>
people don&#39;t realize is that there is such a varied group of <br/>
homeschoolers and unschoolers out there (some people want to put <br/>
them all in one group, and think they are all the same). One woman <br/>
in the audience was an unschooler and she did a nice job showing <br/>
what a wonderful, rich life her 3 kids are living and that the 3 <br/>
kids are happy. And the unschooler on the stage did a good job too, <br/>
and she made the point that her kids have a choice whether they want <br/>
to go to school or not. I think probably a lot of America has never <br/>
heard of Unschooling or does not understand Unschooling so it put <br/>
the word out and hopefully it will make people think about it. They <br/>
had a public school teacher talking about how wonderful public <br/>
school was, and she just was not convincing to me. Dr. Phil himself <br/>
said that he hated school, but he said that if his parents had left <br/>
him to his own divices it would have been a disaster......which is <br/>
where I think he was not understanding how unschooling works. And <br/>
you could see during the show he was trying to process how it <br/>
works. He ended with saying that parents have to do what they feel <br/>
is right for their children. Luckily he did not totally blast the <br/>
unschoolers or homeschoolers which is what I thought would happen. <br/>
