<div id="ygrps-yiv-1017147357">A while ago I compiled some strategies unschoolers had come up with  <br/>
to handle brushing teeth. I posted them and finally found time to  <br/>
format the page for the website:<br/>

<br/>
Originally I figured it would be a list of little things, like not  <br/>
using toothpaste. But it turned into little windows peering in on  <br/>
unschoolers finding ways to help children respectfully.<br/>
<br/>
And I also compiled and put up a page on Transitions: helping kids  <br/>
move from one activity to another. (There will be more at some point,  <br/>
but time is the huge factor!)<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has any more strategies, please pass them on and I&#39;ll add  <br/>
them :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-197233074">Mine have always been a challenge to encourage to brush, and I have an enthusiastic night nurser and an older child with really poorly mineralized enamel, so I&#39;ve felt pressure to make sure they do it.  Here are a couple of ideas that have worked for me.<br/>
 <br/>
1.  My son has sensory issues and hates the feel of bubbles in the mouth.  He brushes with that pink kiddie mouthwash stuff on his brush.<br/>
 <br/>
2.  My three year old likes me to scream while she brushes.  &quot;Haha we&#39;re hiding in the teeth.  Yummy teeth.  Oh no, here comes the toothbrush....Aaaaaahhhh, helllp, noooooo, noooooooooo!  We&#39;ll hide on the top teeth!  No, she&#39;s on to us!  Arrrgh!&quot;  And on like that for however long it takes to get the job done, or until she gets bored.  It works best if I really ham it up.  Alternatively, brushing while listening to or singing Weird Al Yankovic&#39;s &quot;Microscopic Bacteria&quot; is entertaining and motivating.<br/>
