do you have a sandwich maker?  blender?  I&#39;m also a personal chef and I cook veg.  foods just about all day long it seems.  I would be happy to offer you ideas, just not sure where to start.  <br/>

My son (3.5) is into bean burritos with tomatos and onions, macaroni and spinach with extra cheese, pizzas with boca crumbles brocoli and tomatos...falafel, anything dipped in hummus (easy to make).<br/>

I could go all day...<br/>
<br/>
My baby (1) loves guacamole with cottage cheese cheddar.  Smoothies are a huge hit around here and raw pasta sauce (tomatos, garlic in blender).  I make most of my dishes kid friendly by adding cheese or some tomato based sauce...put ANYTHING in a sandwich maker with WW bread and cheese, dip in sauce.<br/>

We tried to be vegan for a little bit but we just can&#39;t stay away from cows cheese!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1610734665">hey y&#39;all~ I&#39;m a newbie here.. and a newbie to the<br/>
whole unschooling thing.. so please forgive me, but i<br/>
am wondering how your children learn  much when its<br/>
just left up to them? it just seems to me like the<br/>
kids wouldn&#39;t want to learn on their own due to lack<br/>
of motivation or whatever. i cant imagine a 12 y.o.<br/>
learning something &quot;important&quot; like math, or spelling<br/>
, or whatever , without any structure. please<br/>
enlighten me! i am very interested in raising my 10m<br/>
old by unschooling, but I&#39;m afraid he will need some<br/>
structured lessons. for example- the lady who took the<br/>
kids to the park and had them write a poem or<br/>
something about an object, i would have thought that<br/>
was a great idea, but alot of people here seems to<br/>
think that was wrong. i&#39;m sorry , but i just don&#39;t see<br/>
kids &quot;wanting&quot; to learn things. i understand that they<br/>
learn thru life experiences, but they don&#39;t<br/>
necessarily learn every thing they might need. how do<br/>
you get a child to want to learn instead of play video<br/>
games, etc?.....please don&#39;t take this negatively ~<br/>
its a legit question. <br/>

Please, keep sharing ideas or send me to good URLs. We are not vegetarians, but my daughter seems to be a natural one :-). I&#39;m not (yet) crazy about cooking, but I want to get better. Everything is so much more fun when there are good things to eat made by a happy cook. My mother hated to cook and I don&#39;t want to pass this feeling along to the next generation. <br/>

<br/>
If you have never been to Trader Joe&#39;s you may like what you can find there<br/>
- if it is in your town.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn (4.5) loves their own brand Corn Dogs - all soy - and they do lots of<br/>
finger food type things. Also heavenly meringues - but don&#39;t get me started.<br/>
The container lasts about half a day. They also have a wide range of nuts,<br/>
seeds, crackers and gourmet type snack foods for very reasonable prices<br/>
compared to a supermarket chain like Ralphs (Krogers). Another favorite is<br/>
their own brand of vege &quot;meat&quot; balls in tomato sauce, in the freezer.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn also likes raw baby carrots - available organically in prepackages and<br/>
peeled - corn on the cob, lightly steamed broccoli and asparagus spears. The<br/>
latter two she expecially likes to dip in either teriyaki or ranch sauce.<br/>
<br/>
We are big consumers of sandwiches of all sorts here. Some people recommend<br/>
using large cookie cutters to make fun shapes. We never have, but it could<br/>
be fun for a party.<br/>

yes...love all the TJ&#39;s stuff (we are big fans of the veggie corn <br/>

meringues (I don&#39;t dare) but I&#39;m a big fan of the Joe&#39;s O&#39;s and I <br/>
can&#39;t even buy a box of those (these things could be gone before I <br/>
get home, although I would rather wait for them at home to enjoy <br/>
them with milk....I don&#39;t buy these anymore....).  Anyway, I would <br/>
love to find some good, tasty, easy, whole food type recipes....<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, the involvement is left up to them, BUT that doesn&#39;t mean that we <br/>
parents just sit on our hands.  ;)  Take them to cool places, parks, <br/>
stores, museums, zoos, libraries, book stores, amusement parks, <br/>
EVERYWHERE.  LOL  Rent movies, play board and card games, make arts and <br/>
crafts materials available, play dough and clay, Legos, jump ropes, <br/>
blankets for forts.....<br/>
<br/>
For example, if your child is into butterflies, make a butterfly garden <br/>
in your yard, see if your closest zoo has a live butterfly exhibit <br/>
(ours in Detroit is really nice!), tour local gardens and watch for <br/>
them.  Maybe in the Spring mail order some caterpillars and tend to <br/>
them until they turn into butterflies and release them into your yard <br/>
-- maybe into your new butterfly garden.  ;)  Check out some books on <br/>
butterflies.  Look online for butterfly web sites.  I could go on, but <br/>
I&#39;ll stop here with my example.<br/>
<br/>
My point is that YOU, the parent, are the facilitator....the tour <br/>
guide, if you will.  You are there to show them around and point out <br/>
the neat stuff, but they&#39;re free to leave the tour at any time -- or to <br/>
keep going.  The choice is theirs.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; [it just seems to me like the kids wouldn&#39;t want to learn<br/>
&gt;  on their own due to lack of motivation or whatever. ]<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It does kind of seem that way when you first hear of unschooling.  But <br/>
look closer.  Children love learning -- until someone or something <br/>
(namely schools) dump a big bucket of water on their fire.  I don&#39;t <br/>
know any (normal functioning) child who CAN&#39;T learn when it&#39;s something <br/>
that they&#39;re interested in.  My DS is really into Bionicles and Legos <br/>
right now.  You might think, &quot;Well, those are toys!  Of course they&#39;d <br/>
be interested in that because they can play&quot; only PLAYING *IS* <br/>
LEARNING.  He takes them apart and puts them back together while <br/>
reading the directions or makes up his own robots from the various <br/>
pieces and then &quot;designs&quot; what functions and options or powers they&#39;ll <br/>
have.  He can play with them for hours each day and never recreate the <br/>
same one.  On the surface it might not look a whole lot like &quot;learning&quot; <br/>
the way you&#39;re thinking (books, pencils, desks, tests) but he&#39;s totally <br/>
learning a ton of things like mechanics, engineering, math, structure, <br/>
creativity, learning what *doesn&#39;t* work, etc.  This applies to just <br/>
about anything your child might be interested in.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; i cant imagine a 12 y.o. learning something &quot;important&quot; like math, or <br/>
&gt; spelling<br/>
&gt; , or whatever , without any structure. please enlighten me!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He&#39;ll learn it just by living.  How can you NOT learn math or spelling? <br/>
  It&#39;s everywhere.  From advertisements, TV, video games, computer use, <br/>
cookbooks, comic books, counting your allowance to see if you can buy <br/>
the newest ____ you don&#39;t have yet, etc.  You don&#39;t need structure to <br/>
figure out how much you need to save when you want to buy something.  <br/>
LOL<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; [i understand that they learn thru life experiences, but they<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t necessarily learn every thing they might need. ]<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I don&#39;t know about you but I sure as heck didn&#39;t learn EVERY <br/>
thing I might need to know.  That came AFTER I was out of school.  I <br/>
was an &quot;A&quot; student, but I only knew facts and figures.  I didn&#39;t have <br/>
knowledge and wisdom.  Big difference.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve learned so many things since graduation that I can&#39;t even name <br/>
them all.  I didn&#39;t learn how to balance a checking account, manage a <br/>
home, cook, clean, have a healthy pregnancy and birth, raise children, <br/>
knit, garden, auto maintantence, taking care of dogs and horses, buying <br/>
a home, getting a job, using a computer, using the Internet, canning <br/>
food, herbalism, nutrition, and how to swim until AFTER I graduated <br/>
from high school.  That short list is just what I came up with off the <br/>
top of my head in about one minute.  There&#39;s tons more, but I won&#39;t <br/>
bore the list.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
I learn new things every day and &quot;big&quot; things on a regular basis.  <br/>
There&#39;s always MORE to learn.  There&#39;s no way that you could ever learn <br/>
EVERY thing you MIGHT need all by the time you&#39;re 18.  Besides, most of <br/>
the things that I now deem &quot;important&quot;.... I didn&#39;t give a rat&#39;s ass <br/>
about when I was a child or teen.  LOL  Those things will come with <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t try?  :)  Seriously, there&#39;s nothing &quot;bad&quot; about playing video <br/>
games.  Your DS is likely reading, using math, strategy, memorizing <br/>
facts and trivia, hand/eye coordination, and more.  Here&#39;s a link to a <br/>
couple of issues including TV, video games and the like.  I also <br/>
*really* encourage you to read through as much of Sandra&#39;s web site as <br/>
you can.  This helped me immensely while I was on my journey of <br/>
learning (GASP!  There I was going and learning again! ;&#39;) about an <br/>
unschooling lifestyle.   <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/life">http://sandradodd.com/life</a><br/>

Cucumber slices, tamari (&quot;healthy&quot; soy sauce) roasted almonds or <br/>

<br/>
I have the two Molly Katzen &quot;kid&quot; cookbooks that were mentioned and my <br/>
thought on them is that although they are nice cookbooks if your CHILD <br/>
wants to cook/make something, they&#39;re not really chock full of <br/>
kid-friendly ideas for Mama to whip up real quick.  I&#39;d just use <br/>
Google.com and search for ideas online rather than spending money on <br/>
those cookbooks.  JMO  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1601923046">&lt;&lt;&lt;it just seems to me like the<br/>
kids wouldn&#39;t want to learn on their own due to lack<br/>
of motivation or whatever. i cant imagine a 12 y.o.<br/>
learning something &quot;important&quot; like math, or spelling<br/>
, or whatever , without any structure.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling doesn&#39;t divide the world into subjects, so the issue of some<br/>
being more important is somewhat irrelevant. Our children live full<br/>
interesting lives pursuing interests that are of vital importance *to them*<br/>
and their interior selves. In the course of this, real life skills such as<br/>
math use or spelling (well enough that the meaning gets across) get learnt.<br/>
Children ask for the help they need unless they have learnt that asking for<br/>
help gets them some kind of lesson with the parent&#39;s agenda foremost. <br/>
<br/>
Children who seem unmotivated are often damaged by school. Alternatively<br/>
they are plenty motivated, but don&#39;t get unconditional support from their<br/>
parents in those interests, so keep them secret. Some have to struggle with<br/>
feelings of lack of self-worth from constantly having their interests<br/>
belittled in favor of &quot;important&quot; schoolish subjects. 12 years old is a long<br/>
way from your baby.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to save your imagination, you can come to the conference and see<br/>
with your own eyes a couple of hundred enthusiastic autodidacts of all ages.<br/>
Or you can keep reading and take our word for it that the kids are full of<br/>
diverse consuming passions.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;i am very interested in raising my 10m<br/>
old by unschooling, but I&#39;m afraid he will need some<br/>
structured lessons.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He may not, or he may want them. The key is following his lead, and leaving<br/>
him free to stop the structured lessons on his timetable. <br/>
<br/>
You may find Unschooling easier if you try to keep the mindset of enjoying<br/>
the present moment, and not getting caught up in future scenario that is at<br/>
least several years away.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt;&lt;i&#39;m sorry , but i just don&#39;t see<br/>
kids &quot;wanting&quot; to learn things. i understand that they<br/>
learn thru life experiences, but they don&#39;t<br/>
necessarily learn every thing they might need.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Through life experiences and self-motivation is the only authentic way to<br/>
learn everything that a person genuinely needs. <br/>
<br/>
If you spend some time observing your son, you will see that &quot;wanting&quot; to<br/>
learn about his expanding world is his primary motivation for all his<br/>
actions. Forced lessons is the number one inhibitor and destroyer of that<br/>
instinct.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt; how do<br/>
you get a child to want to learn instead of play video<br/>
games, etc?.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t.<br/>
We don&#39;t see those as mutually exclusive. <br/>

hey  y&#39;all~ I&#39;m a newbie here.. and a newbie to the<br/>
whole unschooling thing.. so  please forgive me, but i<br/>
am wondering how your children learn  much  when its<br/>
just left up to them? &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Just left up to him, Cameron (16), has learned all about computers  <br/>
(something he HATED  and avoided in school) and types extremely fast;  is self-taught <br/>
to play the drums and a little guitar;  all about the  constitution;  the <br/>
history of  American music: the blues, jazz, blue  grass, R&B, and rock; The 60&#39;s & <br/>
70&#39;s history and social  changes; mountainbiking; skateboarding; filmmaking <br/>
(including his first 5  minute film which made its debut at Spoleto this <br/>
spring); has three jobs (deli,  house/pet-sitting, and volunteers at the independent <br/>
movie theatre). He&#39;s  backpacked in Washington state for three weeks, spent <br/>
three weeks in  Australia and two weeks in Germany---all without me. His <br/>
spelling,  vocabulary, and math have improved multi-fold since he left <br/>
school---because he  *wanted* to get better at these things. He doesn&#39;t want to appear <br/>
&quot;stupid&quot;, so  he puts out effort to learn what he thinks he&#39;s lacking. He&#39;s <br/>
incredibly kind  and has a maturity level of a 30 year old!<br/>
 <br/>
His little brother, Duncan (8), has never been to school. He&#39;s reading  <br/>
better and better. I played Monopoly with him yesterday: He makes change like a  <br/>
pro---understands adding and substracting and counting of money into the  <br/>
thousands---no problem and no lessons. He read almost everything on the cards,  <br/>
struggling with just a few words.He watches a lot of TV, especially Cartoon  <br/>
Network---and I&#39;ll hand it to Ed, Edd, and Eddy: they have huge vocabularies!  And <br/>
so does Duncan! &lt;G&gt; He learned how to swim with no lessons, just by  being in <br/>
the water. He&#39;s an incredible sponge----never having lost the love of  <br/>
learning like his brother did while in school. He amazes me every day----he has  no <br/>
fear of anything!<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
It&#39;s wild what they can be motivated to learn---all on their own! <br/>
 <br/>
What do *you* do now that you are out of school? Nothing? Do *you* do  <br/>
nothing all day because you lack motivation? What are your passions? Do you  believe <br/>
only adults can be passionate? What do *you* do all day? Who&#39;s making  you?<br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
Oh. So you&#39;re only interested in &quot;academic&quot; learning? &lt;g&gt; We  believe that <br/>
ALL learning is valuable. And that we keep ON learning even after  we pass the <br/>
magic age of 18! &lt;g&gt; There&#39;s no time table for learning (even  though schools <br/>
would lead you to believe that!). No schedule. No time limit or  <br/>
maximum/minimum age for learning something.<br/>
 <br/>
My children are surrounded by dogs. They learn about dogs because they  <br/>
observe dogs, because they ask questions about dogs, because I talk about dogs.  <br/>
They go to dog training classes. They do to dog shows. They watch me work with  <br/>
the dogs. They play with the dogs. We groom dogs. They can&#39;t help but learn  <br/>
about dogs. Dogs are a huge part of our lives.<br/>
 <br/>
Same with math and spelling. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 i&#39;m sorry , but i just don&#39;t see<br/>
kids &quot;wanting&quot; to learn things.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Do you really believe that children don&#39;t want to learn things? Is your  <br/>
beautiful ten month old just lying there, learning NOTHING? He&#39;s not crawling?  <br/>
Not trying to stand? Not laughing at you when you make funny faces? He&#39;s not  <br/>
wanting to learn to walk or feed himself? He&#39;s not putting every little thing in <br/>
 his mouth to inspect it and learn what it&#39;s about? Do you think that  <br/>
children don&#39;t want to imitate their loving parents? <br/>
 <br/>
They LOVE to learn! They really DO! They&#39;re hard-wired to learn! Just  look <br/>
at your baby! Isn&#39;t he BRILLIANT???<br/>
 <br/>
School teaches us that learning for the sake of learning is  wrong. That only <br/>
certain &quot;subjects&quot; are worthy of focusing on. That what  inspires *us*, that <br/>
what makes *us* tick, that what gives us joy is  unnecessary-----unless it&#39;s <br/>
reading or writing or &#39;rithmatic. So many children  learn to turn off that <br/>
miraculous gift of learning!<br/>
 <br/>
Most find it again in their twenties. Some sooner. Some not at all. Those  <br/>
are sad people!<br/>
 <br/>
Look at yourself! *You* are interested in your baby and in unschooling.  <br/>
What&#39;s motivating *you*?<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
AAAAAHHHHH!!!! The basis of unschooling! &lt;g&gt; They learn EXACTLY  what they <br/>
need. EXACTLY. And that&#39;s different for each and every person. You  will never <br/>
need to know what I need to know. And I, what you need to know. And  our <br/>
children will have different needs too. That is the KEY!<br/>

And you truly believe that there is no learning happening in video games?  <br/>
They are chocked FULL of learning---you just need to open your eyes to THAT  <br/>
learning: strategy, math, reading, patterns!<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;....please don&#39;t take this negatively ~<br/>

 <br/>
We&#39;re all about legit questions! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I want you to go to   _www.sandradodd.com_ (http://www.sandradodd.com)    and <br/>
read  about unschooling. She has hundreds of articles and essays and posts <br/>
about  learning and unschooling and understanding this whole concept.<br/>
 <br/>
Do you have any other more specific questions?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Why would kids *not* learn when it&#39;s left up to them?<br/>
<br/>
Actually you can&#39;t answer that question because you don&#39;t know any kids. ;-)<br/>
You only know *schooled* kids. And *schooled* kids avoid learning because<br/>
they&#39;re forced to sit and learn things that they don&#39;t care about in ways<br/>
that are hard and boring.<br/>
<br/>
The real question is why in the world do schooled kids ever learn anything!<br/>
;-)<br/>
<br/>
Unschooled kids learn because life is fascinating and they don&#39;t have any<br/>
experience with forced learning. They learn what it interesting to them. And<br/>
everything is potentially interesting.<br/>
<br/>
What they reach 17 knowing is everything they found interesting plus a world<br/>
full of things they don&#39;t know yet but that they&#39;re confident they can learn<br/>
if they need it. What schooled kids end up with is a head full of facts that<br/>
will fade if they aren&#39;t used and a feeling that learning is hard and boring<br/>
and something to be avoided unless someone makes them.<br/>

<br/>
The Three Stages of Unschooling<br/>
<br/>
 My son Cameron (16) and I recently started sitting in on a college <br/>
Sociology class. He asked for and received electric guitar lessons <br/>
for his birthday.  Mondays he goes to a nearby school and takes <br/>
African drumming lessons. He&#39;s taking a weekly film class starting in <br/>
March, and we&#39;ll be sending him to a weeklong film school in Maine in <br/>
May. Duncan (almost 8) just started karate lessons.  Ben (my husband) <br/>
has just finished a class (with tests and all) that&#39;s required before <br/>
he can put on Lt Col (Air National Guard) and is now in NJ for three <br/>
weeks of &quot;rah-rah&quot; and classroom training and tests for the two new <br/>
drugs he will be selling. I&#39;m going to a one-day intensive &quot;Bee <br/>
School&quot; to learn to take care of my Christmas present: two beehives.<br/>
<br/>
Cameron said the other day, &quot;For Unschoolers, we sure are taking a <br/>
lot of schooly classes!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That got me thinking...especially since we are one of those families <br/>
that discovered unschooling after years and years of schooling. I <br/>
think that there are three &quot;Stages of Unschooling&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Stage I<br/>
The first stage is the longest and most difficult and involves <br/>
getting rid of all school-think, which includes classes <br/>
and &quot;instruction&quot; and school-speak. We have to rid ourselves of the <br/>
reliance on schools and teachers and testing and book-worship. We <br/>
need to look deeply into the difference between &quot;teach&quot; and &quot;learn&quot;. <br/>
We ban classes and structure and nagging. It&#39;s accepting that grades <br/>
and requirements and diplomas and curricula and extrinsic motivations <br/>
truly have no meaning in an unschooling life. It&#39;s realizing that the <br/>
whole world is related and inter-related: it&#39;s about NOT dividing the <br/>
world into subjects: math is science is art is history is literature <br/>
is FUN! It&#39;s a time for reflection on how we&#39;ve learned the things <br/>
that really matter in our adult lives.  It&#39;s hard to let go of all <br/>
that school-think, to go beyond what we&#39;ve been *taught* was <br/>
important and to value ALL learning as important. It&#39;s realizing that <br/>
we learn what WE believe is important WHEN we are ready.  And it&#39;s <br/>
realizing that what&#39;s important often changes. It&#39;s about abolishing <br/>
coercion in learning and about the freedom to change passions. It&#39;s <br/>
understanding that learning doesn&#39;t stop.<br/>
<br/>
 Face it, almost all of you reading this in 2004 went to school---at <br/>
least for 12 years, maybe as many as 22 or 25 years! School is so <br/>
ingrained in us, that it&#39;s hard to think any other way. We <br/>
appreciate &quot;straight A students&quot; and &quot;AP&quot; classes and college prep <br/>
high schools and term papers and &quot;higher math&quot; and high SAT/ACT <br/>
scores. &quot;Good&quot; students are given preferential treatment by everyone: <br/>
pizzas for reading and Chuck E. Cheese tokens for good report cards. <br/>
Even our child&#39;s car insurance is lowered if we have an &quot;A student&quot;!<br/>
<br/>
 Stage one is about ridding our minds of those things, about really <br/>
thinking about learning in a holistic manner. It&#39;s about examining <br/>
how we learned what truly interests us---especially those things that <br/>
didn&#39;t require a &quot;teacher&quot;. What are your passions? HOW did you learn <br/>
to do those things? In a classroom?<br/>
<br/>
Two of my passions as a child were dogs and horses. Dogs and horses <br/>
are NOT taught in any grade, middle, or high school *I* know of. But <br/>
I wanted to learn everything I could about them. My parents gave me <br/>
dogs and horses. They bought me books and paid for me to take riding <br/>
lessons and dog obedience classes. They paid for dog and horse shows <br/>
and equipment. My passion threw me into reading every book I could <br/>
find (there were no videos back then----or &quot;Animal Planet&quot;!). By <br/>
twelve I could identify every breed of dog and horse that I had ever <br/>
seen or read about and tell you how it was developed, where, why, and <br/>
by whom. I spent every weekend and every afternoon at a dog <br/>
show/horse show/event/trial or just hanging around the stable or <br/>
kennel. I asked thousands of question and &quot;got my hands dirty&quot;. Many <br/>
of my friends were adults with the same passions. Training, breeding, <br/>
grooming, showing, husbandry----all of these things I learned because <br/>
I was consumed by them!<br/>
<br/>
But, of course, dogs and horses are NOT school subjects---and are <br/>
completely unimportant in the school world. What if I had waited for <br/>
a teacher to come along and say, &quot;Today we are learning all about dog <br/>
and horses&quot;? Not only would I have waited all my life, the teacher <br/>
would only have given me a &quot;taste&quot; of the subject!<br/>
<br/>
 OH! And you *can&#39;t* make a living with dogs and horses---right? &#61514;<br/>
<br/>
Stage one is often referred to as DEschooling. It&#39;s the period of <br/>
time we need to give ourselves in order to &quot;step away from the box&quot; <br/>
of school and school-think. Ask yourself why and how you learned your <br/>
passion: whether it was music, cooking, flying, gardening, or long-<br/>
distance running. Or even more &quot;academic-like&quot; passions, like <br/>
Shakespeare, chemistry, World War II, or a foreign language. When you <br/>
are comfortable with how learning happens by indulging in passions <br/>
and making connections in your learning, you are quickly heading <br/>
towards stage two.<br/>
<br/>
Stage II<br/>
Once you are comfortable with the idea of immersion learning----and <br/>
you&#39;re over wanting or needing classes and structure, you&#39;re finally <br/>
over the deschooling hump and are actively in the process of <br/>
UNschooling.<br/>
<br/>
 Stage two involves really immersing ourselves----and allowing our <br/>
children to immerse themselves---into passions and even into slight, <br/>
fleeting interests.  Seeing connections and making connections and <br/>
yet realizing that somethings *might* not connect for YEARS is the <br/>
most important part of stage two.<br/>
<br/>
Connection: I remember lying in my bed when I was about 11 or 12. My <br/>
bed was behind the door, so that, when open, the door obscured the <br/>
head of my bed. I had tied a string to my doorknob. I would try to <br/>
shut my door with my finger at the point of the doorjamb; then I <br/>
would open the door back up with a pull on the string. It took *a <br/>
lot* of pressure (and pain!) to close my door at the point of the <br/>
jamb. But every inch closer to the door knob I got, it would be <br/>
easier and easier to close, so that by the time I was right at the <br/>
edge of the door (by the knob), I could almost &quot;blow&quot; it shut. I <br/>
had &quot;discovered&quot; torque----but it had no name!<br/>
<br/>
School&#39;s idea that children should be given the definition of torque <br/>
and then have it explained is backwards. It was so simple for me to <br/>
understand the definition of torque because I already had made the <br/>
personal and meaningful connection with my bedroom door.<br/>
<br/>
Passion: There are people who invest their time (and many even make a <br/>
living) studying Elizabethan fashion or reading/writing about the <br/>
works of John Steinbeck or determining whether an 17th century chair <br/>
is a forgery or watching birds make nests/feed their young or , as I <br/>
heard on the radio yesterday: there&#39;s this guy who&#39;s getting his <br/>
Masters degree in Soil Science! Go figure!<br/>
<br/>
If allowed (and often, even if not allowed!), a child will pursue his <br/>
career by following his passion(s). A wise parent will encourage this <br/>
pursuit of passion, because it may be what the child decides to <br/>
devote his life&#39;s work to. Maybe *more* importantly, that wise parent <br/>
will step aside when a passion becomes &quot;old&quot; because the parent will <br/>
know that *some* connection has been made with this fleeting passion.<br/>
<br/>
From 10-12 years old, Cameron was a magician. I actually thought that <br/>
he would become the next Lance Burton or Jeff McBride (who once <br/>
referred to Cameron as &quot;mini-me&quot;!). He was so passionate about magic, <br/>
he would practice and perform ALL day! Insert here: &quot;If I let him, <br/>
Cameron would sit around and do magic ALL DAY!&quot; Well, he DID! Until <br/>
the day when he quit. I was stunned! He&#39;d lost all interest. We&#39;d put <br/>
thousands of dollars into costumes and tricks and gimmicks and <br/>
conventions and tapes and books and private sessions with famous <br/>
magicians---and he just up and quit.<br/>
<br/>
At first I was incredulous. Then I realized it was just an intense, <br/>
fleeting passion. We still have a huge box of magic upstairs in the <br/>
attic. He can come back to it whenever----or not. What&#39;s important is <br/>
that it inspired him and fed a passion and entertained him (and us <br/>
and hundreds more). He met some truly fascinating people and made <br/>
connections that will last a lifetime---because he had an interest, a <br/>
passion.<br/>
<br/>
Stage one, deschooling, is a very uncomfortable time! It&#39;s a period <br/>
of intense questioning and of challenging yourself to think <br/>
differently. This is difficult, but it can be done---as with all <br/>
learning: when you&#39;re ready to!<br/>
<br/>
Stage two may be even more uncomfortable, because you&#39;re actually <br/>
putting the ideas into action: you&#39;re allowing the passions to take <br/>
over and you&#39;re not pushing the three &quot;R&#39;s&quot;. You are beginning to <br/>
trust that the child will learn and you&#39;re respecting his choices. <br/>
You&#39;re UNschooling! And the more you do it, the easier it gets!<br/>
<br/>
Stage three is freedom and joy and trust and respect and desire: <br/>
Radical Unschooling<br/>
<br/>
 Stage III<br/>
<br/>
The third and final stage is when we can honestly and sincerely look <br/>
at ALL learning as equal and not hold one &quot;method&quot; or style or <br/>
subject or means of obtaining information above another. By stage <br/>
three, we live and breathe unschooling---it&#39;s such a part of our day-<br/>
to-day living that we can&#39;t separate it from our lives: it&#39;s not just <br/>
the &quot;educational&quot; part because *everything* is educational. We can <br/>
apply unschooling principles to bedtimes and eating and video gaming <br/>
and TV and &quot;chores&quot;. We know that our children will learn because <br/>
it&#39;s what they were born to do; they&#39;re hard-wired to learn. Learning <br/>
is how the human species survives and progresses and<br/>
succeeds.<br/>
<br/>
This is the stage when we can effectively and confidently start <br/>
giving out unschooling information to the uninformed or misinformed <br/>
because we &quot;get it.&quot; We can live our lives joyfully because we&#39;re not <br/>
worried whether Susie will pass her algebra or whether Johnny will be <br/>
able to get into a good college, because they WILL if they want to. <br/>
We know that they will pursue their passions...well, passionately! <br/>
And that each day will bring more connections and learning <br/>
opportunities.<br/>
<br/>
This is the stage when classes and instruction may eke back into our <br/>
lives, as it recently has in our family&#39;s. We don&#39;t give more weight <br/>
to the learning that is happening in Sociology-101 or karate or bee-<br/>
keeping just because it&#39;s happening in a classroom situation. A class <br/>
is just another means of pursuing our passions, making the <br/>
connections, and receiving the information. Learning happens all the <br/>
time in all places---*even* in a classroom!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to give the impression that acceptance of class/book <br/>
learning automatically makes you a Radical Unschooler. Stage III <br/>
cannot &quot;just happen&quot;: you&#39;ll have to go through Stages I and II <br/>
first. For those of us that attended school, deschooling will always <br/>
exist at a lower level throughout our lives. The next generation (our <br/>
unschooled children) will not have this stage to work through: <br/>
they&#39;ll be able to see all learning as equal and good from the get-go.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a process: getting rid of the school-think and structure, <br/>
becoming comfortable and implementing immersion learning, and *then* <br/>
accepting ALL learning as equally valuable.</div>

I agree ...and it takes awhile to be rid of it all. <br/>
But..about classes..if a child WANTS particular classes...then that&#39;s ok <br/>
right?<br/>
An unschooler can still take a class...but being aware it&#39;s not the only way <br/>
to learn.<br/>
  <br/>
  My son loved an archeology class he took last year...a homeschool <br/>
class...held at the library. They guy was terrific with the kids and they do hands-on <br/>
activities. My son is thrilled to take some more this year...Geology, <br/>
palentology, etc.<br/>

The Three Stages of Unschooling<br/>
<br/>
My son Cameron (16) and I recently started sitting in on a college <br/>
Sociology class. He asked for and received electric guitar lessons <br/>
for his birthday.  Mondays he goes to a nearby school and takes <br/>
African drumming lessons. He&#39;s taking a weekly film class starting in <br/>
March, and we&#39;ll be sending him to a weeklong film school in Maine in <br/>
May. Duncan (almost 8) just started karate lessons.  Ben (my husband) <br/>
has just finished a class (with tests and all) that&#39;s required before <br/>
he can put on Lt Col (Air National Guard) and is now in NJ for three <br/>
weeks of &quot;rah-rah&quot; and classroom training and tests for the two new <br/>
drugs he will be selling. I&#39;m going to a one-day intensive &quot;Bee <br/>
School&quot; to learn to take care of my Christmas present: two beehives.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1052585238">&lt;&lt;&lt;Yes, Trader Joes rules!  Robyn, I think we must be fairly close to <br/>
you...we live in Huntington Beach and from what I surmise you are <br/>
SoCal too.  We used to live in LA...Fairfax area.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Right, I&#39;m in Playa Del Rey (by LAX). I gather you have already hooked up<br/>
with Pam and the Dragontree Homelearners in Long Beach. I get down there too<br/>
rarely for my own good. Just lovely people. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Haven&#39;t tried the meringues (I don&#39;t dare)&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The funny thing about the meringues is that they are a perfect illustration<br/>
of the good results of not limiting foods. <br/>
<br/>
I am completely unable to resist them, and will eat them consecutively until<br/>
after I start to feel ill - about half the container I&#39;m embarrassed to say.<br/>
I have even tried buying the ones I like least (which does not in any way<br/>
approach actual DISlike) to try to put the brakes on myself. Ironically that<br/>
is the one Jayn likes most - the Mint Chocolate Chip. If she notices them in<br/>
the store she will sometimes ask for them, sometimes prefers something else.<br/>
When we get home she will ask for a meringue or two. <br/>
<br/>
Hours later I will find half meringues in odd spots, under a chair, on the<br/>
bedside table or on the arm of the sofa - just wherever she happened to be<br/>
when she felt she has had enough for now. Of course I see these finds as<br/>
nice bonus for me ;) She likes sweets, but just has no calling to binge on<br/>
anything. Wonderful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-319858798">** i&#39;m sorry , but i just don&#39;t see kids &quot;wanting&quot; to learn things. **<br/>
<br/>
I know you probably used this as a figure of speech, but maybe that&#39;s <br/>
something you should think about. You don&#39;t ever &quot;see&quot; kids wanting to learn things <br/>
because you&#39;re probably not spending any time around unschooled kids but likely <br/>
not spending time around any kids at all except your own, who, while he is <br/>
most certainly busy learning things because he WANTS to is doing it currently in <br/>
ways that thoroughly schooled adults seem to utterly miss. <br/>
<br/>
I suggest really watching the effort your son is putting into learning to get <br/>
around, learning to control all parts of his body, learning to understand <br/>
language and to reproduce it. In a couple years he&#39;ll be asking questions a mile <br/>
a minute. If you don&#39;t send him to school where questions are discouraged and <br/>
deflected (often especially in the classrooms of teachers who proclaim &quot;there <br/>
is no such thing as a stupid question&quot;) he&#39;ll keep that inquisitive nature and <br/>
the drive to conquer his world.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Why would kids *not* learn when it&#39;s left up to<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Actually you can&#39;t answer that question because you<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know any kids. ;-)<br/>
&gt; You only know *schooled* kids. And *schooled* kids<br/>
&gt; avoid learning because<br/>
&gt; they&#39;re forced to sit and learn things that they<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t care about in ways<br/>
&gt; that are hard and boring.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The real question is why in the world do schooled<br/>
&gt; kids ever learn anything!<br/>
&gt; ;-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Unschooled kids learn because life is fascinating<br/>
&gt; and they don&#39;t have any<br/>
&gt; experience with forced learning. They learn what it<br/>
&gt; interesting to them. And<br/>
&gt; everything is potentially interesting.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What they reach 17 knowing is everything they found<br/>
&gt; interesting plus a world<br/>
&gt; full of things they don&#39;t know yet but that they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; confident they can learn<br/>
&gt; if they need it. What schooled kids end up with is a<br/>
&gt; head full of facts that<br/>
&gt; will fade if they aren&#39;t used and a feeling that<br/>
&gt; learning is hard and boring<br/>
&gt; and something to be avoided unless someone makes<br/>
&gt; them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-987192671">I wrote this in my journal about a month ago, it is on this topic so <br/>
I thought you might be interested in reading it.<br/>

Christy<br/>
<br/>
When people find out I&#39;m homeschooling my son, most ask if I&#39;m afraid <br/>
they&#39;ll be holes in my his education, aren&#39;t I afraid I&#39;ll miss <br/>
something important?  I always answer, of course they&#39;ll be holes in <br/>
his education, but no, I&#39;m not afraid of missing anything important.  <br/>
On the surface this answer seems contradictory, but on closer <br/>
examination it makes perfect sense.<br/>
<br/>
Of course they&#39;ll be holes in his education.  We all haves holes in <br/>
our education.  There is so much to do, see, and learn in this world, <br/>
there is no way anyone can learn it all.  There is no way any school <br/>
can even come close to teaching it all.  How many people graduate <br/>
high school knowing nothing about chemistry or world politics?  How <br/>
many people graduate college knowing nothing about art or religion?<br/>
<br/>
I have a PhD in biology.  I spent 23 years of my life in school.  23 <br/>
years!  I have huge holes in my knowledge.  Although I&#39;m a scientist <br/>
I know very little about physics.  I knew even less geology and <br/>
almost no astronomy.  I&#39;m learning more astronomy now because my <br/>
husband is really interested in it.  My holes in other subjects are <br/>
even larger.<br/>
<br/>
My son wants to build a real combat robot like those seen in <br/>
Battlebots.  I know nothing about this.  I have no idea how the <br/>
mechanics work, how the motors and gears go together to make motion.  <br/>
I don&#39;t know how the electronics are hooked up to bring power to all <br/>
the components.  Programming a remote is beyond me.  Even the metal <br/>
working, the seemingly simplest part leaves me at a loss.  The good <br/>
news is I can learn all these things.  I am learning all these <br/>
things.  I can fill this hole.  However, I will always have holes.  <br/>
So will my son.<br/>
<br/>
No, I&#39;m not afraid of missing anything important.  What&#39;s important <br/>
to learn is different for each person.  What&#39;s important for an <br/>
artist to know will be totally different than what&#39;s important for a <br/>
mathematician to know.  I can&#39;t know what will be important to my <br/>
son, a school certainly can&#39;t know what will be important to him, <br/>
only he can know that.  What I do know is that if it is important he <br/>
will learn it.  He may not learn it by the time he is 10 or 15 or <br/>
even 18, but learning doesn&#39;t stop at these ages.  Learning happens <br/>
our entire life.  If it is important to know when he is 40, he can <br/>
learn it then.  There is no deadline on learning.<br/>
<br/>
There will definitely be holes in my son&#39;s education, but I&#39;m not <br/>
worried about missing anything important.</div>
