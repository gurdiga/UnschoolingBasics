<div id="ygrps-yiv-1137353293">Hi, everyone!  I am new here, I just followed a link and joined up <br/>
today.  :)  I am the proud mother of 2 beautiful dd and the wife of <br/>
one slightly grumpy dh.  ;)  (he&#39;s grumpy because he&#39;s trying to <br/>
figure out what&#39;s wrong with my car)  We have had a wonderful <br/>
Valentine&#39;s Day...enjoying being with people we love.  We took my <br/>
SIL a DVD slideshow (pics of her kids) for her b-day, then stopped <br/>
for milkshakes and curly fries with cheese on the way home.  When we <br/>
first got up this am. it was CHOCOLATE FOR EVERYONE!!!!  I&#39;m <br/>
nibbling on my truffles as I type.   :)  DH gave me a vintage <br/>
stapler he picked up at a flea market for Valentine&#39;s Day, and I got <br/>
a lot of mileage out of pretending to be mystified by it.  LOL  It&#39;s <br/>
been beautiful and warm outside today, which is always nice, <br/>
especially in February!  Oh, I guess I&#39;m rambling...I have just <br/>
enjoyed this day so much and wanted to share it a little. :)  <br/>
  About us, my girls have never been in a PS, my oldest did a year <br/>
of Headstart which we both hated, and they haven&#39;t been away from me <br/>
since.  They read almost constantly (Dh is talking about building us <br/>
a library for all our books this summer!)  they love to watch <br/>
Gilligan&#39;s Island (we bought the DVD series), they are very much <br/>
into their pets, 4 cats, 2 dogs, 10 rabbits, and one smelly <br/>
ferrett.  They work on their altered books a lot, and their <br/>
scrapbooks, and we just recently discovered Art Trading Cards, which <br/>
they have been enjoying doing.  Really, anything crafty they are <br/>
into.  DH has been working on video production and animation lately <br/>
and they are getting interested in that with him.  It&#39;s so much fun <br/>
watching them find things they are interested in and trying so many <br/>
new things.  My oldest dd (10) decided she wanted to do carpentry, <br/>
so she asked for tools for her b-day...she hasn&#39;t made anything yet, <br/>
but when she decided to, she has the equipment.  <br/>
 I know I have gone on and on, but it&#39;s nice to be here with you all <br/>
and I look forward to getting to know you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1488971289">I just bumped into them online and thought they looked like so much <br/>
fun.  I actually didn&#39;t think of looking for a children&#39;s forum...that <br/>
might have been a good idea!!  I just showed them pics online of cards <br/>
and they jumped right on it and made several.  My 10yr. old made a <br/>
beautiful one with butterflies, I&#39;m trying to work out a trade with <br/>
her. ;)<br/>
