  Wanting to help my child be empathetic and help her take into account <br/>
the impact her actions have on other people? Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Is it an all-or-nothing situation? Either we&#39;re interested in our own <br/>
kid&#39;s feelings OR the other kids? But not both?<br/>
<br/>
The person who called me controlling also said, &quot;I care about MY kids; <br/>
you care about yours.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I cared about her kids, too, for years, and thought she cared about <br/>
mine, too. Are we really supposed to be so cold and uncaring to not <br/>
even care about other people&#39;s children at all?<br/>
