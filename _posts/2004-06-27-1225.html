<div id="ygrps-yiv-648119314">Hi, <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Brenda, an unschooler of my two children, 11 & 12.  I may not <br/>
have time to participate in this group, but I wanted to invite anyone <br/>
interested to join my e-mail list to discuss options of intentional <br/>
community for homeschooling families.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m exploring the possibilities of  starting a family-focused <br/>
community near Twin Oaks Community in Virginia (I&#39;ve been a member <br/>
there for 16 years), but the e-mail list is also for homeschool <br/>
families interested in intentional community in other areas.<br/>
<br/>
I am not writing this with the intention of starting a discussion on <br/>
this list.  Please e-mail me or subscribe to the list at:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-128005964">Brenda, we may be kindred spirits, but Texas has no homeschool laws, so I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever be leaving it.  I&#39;m interested in starting an intentional community, or even better.... a commune.  I have two other interested families, but I doubt anything will happen soon.  Our focus is unschooling, but in the mean time, I&#39;m trying my best to move onto a street that has 6 other homeschooling families, 2 or whom are unschoolers... with me, that would be 3 unschooling families... getting close to an even split.<br/>

Come to Texas!<br/>
