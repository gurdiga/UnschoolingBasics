<div id="ygrps-yiv-2015981272">It was asked why a person knowing that they are not an unschooler would join<br/>
an unschooling list.  I thought I would take that question in general and<br/>
just answer it with my own reasons.<br/>
<br/>
 I joined an unschooling list knowing full well I am not an<br/>
unschooler.  So I&#39;ll explain why I joined this list.  I have a wonderful<br/>
dear friend who is a fantastic unschooler and I appreciate her views on<br/>
things.  Even though I don&#39;t want to follow in her footsteps, I like to<br/>
listen and apply some of her ideas.  I&#39;ve become more in tune with my<br/>
children and am letting go more.  Because of being exposed to unschooling,<br/>
through her, I&#39;m learning how to find more natural educational &quot;moments&quot; and<br/>
help further my own children&#39;s&#39; natural interests.<br/>
<br/>
I know not to talk about curriculums and schedules here.  This is<br/>
another reason why I DID join.  Many other &quot;homeschooling&quot; lists talk about<br/>
curriculum subjects and I&#39;m just seeking a list where people share HOW they<br/>
and their children learn &quot;outside&quot; of school and/or without it.  I&#39;m<br/>
interested in hearing more real life examples and apply some of &quot;your&quot; ideas<br/>
to my life and enrich my children&#39;s<br/>
childhood. When my daughter wants to learn something on her own I want to be<br/>
able to post to the list and ask for ideas to help her pursue her interests<br/>
naturally.<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to share my reasons.<br/>
<br/>
Respectfully,<br/>
 Sue</div>

<br/>
I just wanted to point out, that I included those that wanted to <br/>
discuss unschooling in my question. If I didn&#39;t, my bad.<br/>
<br/>
It seemed the person in question wasn&#39;t interested in discussing, <br/>
reading about or being an unschooler on any level...which is why I <br/>
posed the question.<br/>
<br/>
It was interesting reading your reasons for being here...welcome!<br/>
<br/>
I have to warn you though, once you start learning about unschooling <br/>
and questioning certain things, it can be infectious!:)</div>

Sue, I think this is very cool. Even if you never intend to be an  <br/>
unschooler, I think there are valuable things anyone could learn about trusting  your <br/>
kids, responding to desires in kids, empowerment, etc. from unschoolers.  It&#39;s <br/>
really clear that although you do not plan to unschool, that you respect  it.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m glad you&#39;re here.<br/>

Fine reasons to be on an unschooling list----but beware----we *might*  just <br/>
convert you! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
The problem isn&#39;t lurkers who want to learn more; it&#39;s those that would  like <br/>
to insist that giving reading assignments and forcing algebra on children  is <br/>
unschooling. Or who insist that a child can be &#39;behind&#39;. Those are problems  <br/>
on an unschooling list. BUT great converations can pop up due to them!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Glad you&#39;re here, Sue. Enjoy lurking---and feel free to ask  <br/>
questions---whenever!<br/>
