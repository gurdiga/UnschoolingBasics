<div id="ygrps-yiv-1530188364">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new here. I&#39;ve had my children him this year for the first time. <br/>
My oldest is 11 on the 30th, then my second will be 7 on June 9, <br/>
then the third child will be 3 on the 18th.<br/>
<br/>
Firstly, I am SO shocked by the lack of support I&#39;ve seen on this <br/>
group. I&#39;m hoping I just walked in at a bad time! I belong to a <br/>
handful of homeschooling/unschooling/RU groups and I&#39;ve found one <br/>
main thread throughout all. If you say something that COULD be <br/>
construed as &#39;negative&#39;, you get FLAMED. Some sites are definately <br/>
worse than others. I, honestly, hold back saying things on some <br/>
sites simply b/c I don&#39;t want to ripped apart. Either mildly or <br/>
violently. I&#39;ve witnessed it on all sites. For real!<br/>
<br/>
What is up?? Aren&#39;t we, as mothers, on a whole supposed to support <br/>
and nurture each other?? Ok, we&#39;ll have opposing opinions and maybe <br/>
need guidance but what&#39;s the deal with ATTACKING other women? I run <br/>
playgroups and our JOB is to gently try to help or provide <br/>
information to parents who need/ask for it. Women are opening up <br/>
themselves, in a time of need to ask for guidance and there are <br/>
responders who literally JUMP all over them. Where&#39;s the guidance? <br/>
Gentle nature? Warmly presented information? <br/>
<br/>
As  first time mom, I thought I knew IT ALL. And I had every single <br/>
one of my &#39;theories&#39; tested by my son. I still am. I am learning <br/>
EVERY SINGLE day. Can we open our hearts to realize that we are all <br/>
on a journey and we are finding our way?<br/>
<br/>
I hope I didn&#39;t go off on a tangent but people shouldn&#39;t be wary, <br/>
like me, to ask a question or to vent in fear that they will be <br/>
seriously criticized.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m not here to support disrespect to children. I didn&#39;t start this<br/>
list to support anything and everything. I don&#39;t support spanking, I<br/>
don&#39;t support arbitrary limits I don&#39;t support ALL parenting styles.<br/>
Nope, nope, nope.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s lame to expect that.<br/>
I think it&#39;s pretty bold to tell a group that was started for a<br/>
specific purpose, with a group of volunteers that donates time and<br/>
energy year after year, HOW they should run their group.<br/>
<br/>
And now, this is officially in violation of list guidelines.<br/>
Meta-discussions are off limits. So let&#39;s get back to talking about<br/>
UNSCHOOLING please, rather than how lame the list is.<br/>

blindsided by the approach of lists intended to provide discussion  <br/>
and information about a particular subject.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re having problems and want to see what solutions to those  <br/>
problems look like when filtered through unschooling and respect for  <br/>
children, then ask away. :-) It&#39;s a very good list for people who are  <br/>
looking for exactly that.<br/>
<br/>
If you need a place to share what&#39;s going on in your life and offer  <br/>
sympathy to other unschooling parents, there are other lists for that  <br/>
type of connecting.<br/>
<br/>
Different lists for different needs! Keeping trying lists out until  <br/>
you find one that&#39;s a good fit for you. :-)<br/>

I normally would not respond to this.  But most lists  for unschooling ( not <br/>
sure about this list) but most are NOT support  groups.  They are there for <br/>
information.  And yes your ways will be  questioned and asked to be explained.  <br/>
If you are a sensitive person these  lists are not for you.  They are not <br/>
meant as a personal attack on you or  your parenting styles it is merly a way to <br/>
get to you to maybe look at it from a  different way.  To get you to see there <br/>
are other options maybe better  options then the ones you presented.  Most <br/>
people who are on these lists  that you think are rude are there for that <br/>
interaction.  They want to  be questioned and asked why and how and what it will <br/>
accomplish.  It  is how we grow as parents and partners to our kids.   Once again  <br/>
if you go and read the mission statement for most of the groups it clearly <br/>
says  these are NOT support groups. And that if you get easily offended then <br/>
these  lists are probably not for you.  But there are a lot of great groups that  <br/>
ARE support groups if that is what you are looking for.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see it as being flamed... I see passionate RUers who will<br/>
passionately support what goes into RU.  I think those who are being<br/>
challenged feel challenged and threatened because their paradigm will either<br/>
have to change or they will just have to stay where they are.  Change is<br/>
never easy...<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve never seen an attack... I have seen those ideas that don&#39;t jive with RU<br/>
being passionately rebuked.  If you come here seeking answers and guidance,<br/>
then you need to be open to the answers to your questions.<br/>
