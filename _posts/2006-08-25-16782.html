<div id="ygrps-yiv-1293974591">Nicholas (4) and I just returned from a day trip to Vermont. <br/>
There is a neat stop at the top of what I think was called Stow  Mountain. It <br/>
was foggy and damp but a neat spot. The ride was nice though  my brakes got <br/>
hot. I was wondering if I was going to end of there for the  night.<br/>
 <br/>
Bennington reminds me of the cape a bit. A small town where you feel  <br/>
compelled to stop.<br/>
 <br/>
The drive was a little tiring and boy am I happy to be  home. <br/>
Dustin (14) offered to watch Cameron (2) and one of the littles which  was <br/>
great bc I wasn&#39;t sure how the trip would fair with 3-4 kids on the  road for 8 <br/>
hours in one day.<br/>
Dustin stayed with Cameron and Cassidy (6) (daddy works right in town too  so <br/>
that helped knowing due to the distance I was going from home). They ate  <br/>
pizza and watched movies and played until daddy got home. This was the longest I  <br/>
had been gone while he watched them and they all did great. <br/>
It was nice to spend the day with Nicholas. We ate and smiled and  talked for <br/>
lunch and dinner. We chatted off and on during the ride and he  watch Finding <br/>
Nemo also. He loved the clouds at the top of the mountain you  could nearly <br/>
touch them. He awed at the sites and napped for an hour. He met the  man at the <br/>
machine shop we went to see about a boat engine and wowed at all the  parts. <br/>
He watched with his breath held while the man loaded our boat engine into  the <br/>
Durango. I think I did too now that I think about it.<br/>
We had a great day!<br/>
 <br/>
What a wonderful life this unscholing leads. <br/>

I posted an intro the other day, but I haven&#39;t seen it yet.  I may <br/>
just have missed it.<br/>

Anyway, I was wondering if there are any good books out there that <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1886455515">Peace Laura and Welcome!<br/>
<br/>
I was in your shoes just a year ago.  I had a 2 yr old and a 5 yr old.  I started trying to homeschool very lightly but came to realize very quickly that even light was not right for my son.  I had dismissed unschooling when I first heard about it about 2 yrs prior to my starting our homeschooling journey.  Unfortunately, I dismissed it without doing my research first.  BUT, all things happen for a reason.  Because I realized that unschooling was actually the way that my family HAD to go in order for me to maintain my commitment to peaceful parenting and truly respecting my children as people.<br/>
<br/>
I came to realize that my main issue was that I really did not understand how young children learn.  I learned of John Holt from another group that I was part of then and went and read two of his books.  I fell in love with unschooling from then on.  It was not until I joined this group that I came to understand that there is a difference between unschooling and radical unschooling.  I have accepted radical unschooling as the lifestyle that most fits my families personality.  But what I have learned from Holt has been key to my giving into to the process of how children learn and allowing it to unfold naturally in my children.  Being part of this group has helped not only embrace accepting my children learning in their own way and time but also has helped me to stay firmly commited to extending that same perspective to the way we live in general.<br/>
<br/>
I have heard others really praise Sandra Dodd and recently I have decided to buy a book by Rue Cream&#39;s book.  I don&#39;t have the name of it but if you do a search of the archives, you will easily find the name of her book.<br/>
<br/>
After one year I am really just now getting comfortable.  I am now at a place that I want to continue to immerse myself in reading all that I can about unschooling as we continue learning through living.  I wish you all the best and encourage you to be very gentle with yourself.  Unschooling initially is more about the parents unschooling themselves than anything else.  After a while you will see that children are learning all that the time.  And what I enjoy the most is learning with my children.  It has helped me to get in a really good place with my inner girl.<br/>
<br/>
I wish you all the best.<br/>
<br/>
Much Love<br/>
Tyra<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-61159936">Hello Laura,<br/>
<br/>
I just re-read the age of your children.  I thought your 5 month old was 5 yrs old.  Good for you taking time to learn about unschooling before hand.  There is another group called Always Unschooled that seems to be perfect for people whose children are quite young like yours.<br/>
<br/>
Peace and Love again<br/>

<br/>
That is what I am seeing from reading the other posts on this list.  <br/>
I was raised in a verbally abusive/yelling household, and my husband <br/>
was physically, sexually abused, and very neglected as a child.  I <br/>
have always been very controlling of my environment, wanting <br/>
things &quot;just so&quot;, and the outcome of everything to be just the way I <br/>
want it.  I am coming to see this about myself more and more since <br/>
having children.  From reading the posts the past couple of days I <br/>
see that unschooling is about un-control.  What a unique concept!  I <br/>
will definitely be reading more and wrapping my mind around it.  I <br/>
don&#39;t want my children raised like I was, and my husband (who has <br/>
had counseling since becoming an adult) definitely wants better for <br/>
them, but I can see he doesn&#39;t always know how to act as a parent, <br/>
since he had very few good examples growing up.  He often follows my <br/>
lead and examples, so I have to be proactive about this and become <br/>
the example for my household.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you very much for the reading recommendations, I am going to <br/>
go search for some books now.<br/>
<br/>

 <br/>
What I have been noticing more and more as we go down the path of unschooling is that the biggest thing I have to give up is a schedule.  The more rushed I feel to get things done at a specific time, the worse my parenting is.  When I watch the children and wait for them to be ready, everything goes much smoother.  I can keep in mind what we have to do each day and the amount of time we need to do it.  But I can also be realilistic about when we have to do it.  The store is open all day, the library til 8, the nursery at the YMCA till 12.  When I don&#39;t rush the children just to keep to a schedule, everything runs so much smoother.  <br/>
 <br/>
   I&#39;m not sure this is related, but it has been on my mind lately.  Thought it might help others like me, who love to have a plan, come hell or high water.<br/>
