<div id="ygrps-yiv-1894629276">The introduction to math needs to occur in the preschool years when the developing brain is actively pruning &quot;unused&quot; synapses.  This pruning stops at about age 5 and then by mid-adolescence, mylenation (coating of the synapses to make the connections quicker) is said to slow.  With a solid foundation, the brain can continue to learn heirarchical math.  It gets more and more difficult for the brain to learn this kind of processing as one ages without any previous mathematical learning.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-317377758">-~~A homeschooling parent and former teacher told me today that<br/>
children must learn skip counting or multiplication by age 12 or the<br/>
neural pathways that allow this will close as an explanation of why<br/>
children must be forced to learn. ~~<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Total and complete bullshit.<br/>
If you think about what they call &quot;multiplication&quot; in school, it is<br/>
simply memorization of facts. That isn&#39;t anything you need to learn at<br/>
any age. Ever. It&#39;s more convenient but memorization isn&#39;t exactly a<br/>
skill that you need by a certain age.<br/>
<br/>
REAL multiplication is used all the time, when we use money or cook or<br/>
grow gardens.... the unschooled brain is exposed to the situations in<br/>
which it can use those skills all the time! If your child is living<br/>
and having fun, they are using numbers and learning multiplication.<br/>
Real math is in the doing, in the using of numbers and learning to<br/>
manipulate them. It has NOTHING to do with the equations on paper.<br/>
That&#39;s just how we communicate math concepts. A person can learn THAT<br/>
part anytime in life.<br/>
<br/>
Skip counting?? Whoop-te-do! Who cares...seriously. I bet they&#39;d say<br/>
you have to learn how to tie your shoes by a certain age or you&#39;ll<br/>
never learn. I bet they&#39;d say a person who didn&#39;t read by a certain<br/>
age would have issues their entire life. They should meet my 14 year<br/>
old who would disprove THAT idea (he learned to read after 12).<br/>
<br/>
Our society has a lot of fear tied up into learning things early. Like<br/>
earlier is better somehow. The mind that is nurtured and healthy, the<br/>
mind that is exposed to ideas and places and people and given freedom<br/>
to dream, THAT mind can learn whatever it needs whenever it needs the<br/>
information or skill.<br/>
<br/>
I say &quot;pppphhhhhffffttttt&quot; to the very mistaken notion that we need to<br/>
learn anything by any certain age.<br/>

<br/>
What do you mean by &quot;mathematical learning&quot;? Because if you&#39;re talking<br/>
about the equations on paper, then I say BALONEY. A human being<br/>
exposed to LIFE is gaining &quot;mathematical learning&quot; even when it<br/>
doesn&#39;t look like it. Without a single math lesson of any kind, ever,<br/>
my children have picked up mathematical concepts with ease. So I ask<br/>
for clarification on the above statement because the kind of &quot;math&quot;<br/>
they do in school (or in prescribed lessons of any kind) is NOT<br/>
necessary for the brain to learn that kind of processing.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, I think it&#39;s harmful to the brain&#39;s very natural way of<br/>
processing numbers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-97460791">Okay article, it states that there are optimal times for learning  <br/>
certain things, but does emphasize plasticity of learning...which is  <br/>
sooo important. Optimal is key.<br/>
<br/>
Having a child with developmental disabilities, I heard a lot of &quot;IF  <br/>
they don&#39;t learn it by age X, they&#39;ll never learn it&quot; or &quot;If you  <br/>
don&#39;t teach Y, they will never learn to Z&quot;. Breanna has continued to  <br/>
amaze professionals everywhere, because she is not learning these  <br/>
things according to some artificial timeline, she is learning it on  <br/>
hers. It&#39;s just as effective, but it&#39;s based on strategy, rather than  <br/>
rote learning (which is something else that the article brings up) I  <br/>
have kids who are completely neurotypical, learning on their own time  <br/>
line, and seem to be doing really well. Emily never wanted to learn  <br/>
skip counting, but figured out multiplication in one day. Weeks later  <br/>
she&#39;d figured out basic algebraic concepts by herself.<br/>
<br/>
By saying that if a child doesn&#39;t learn by a certain age, that they  <br/>
will never learn, she is dismissing thousands of disabled children  <br/>
who learn, people who suffer from traumatic brain injuries and  <br/>
actually develop BRAND NEW NEURAL circuits to perform these tasks, as  <br/>
well as children who just learn differently but are stuck in a  <br/>
schooly environment that tells them they are broken. Ick.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-647104358">My husband coaches athletes (specifically race car drivers) and  <br/>
particularly addresses brain function and learning in his seminars. I  <br/>
asked him, since one of his passions is how the brain works. This is  <br/>
what he wrote:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t have anything that specifically deals with skip counting (I&#39;m  <br/>
assuming she&#39;s talking about counting by 2s or 5s) or multiplication.  <br/>
But, if you read the book &#39;The Brain That Changes Itself&#39; (and watch  <br/>
&#39;The Brain Fitness Program&#39; that was on PBS tonight), it pretty much  <br/>
says that any talk about how our brains are hardwired at any point in  <br/>
life is not true. The research mentioned in the book talks about how  <br/>
we can learn pretty much anything at any time in our lives, and that  <br/>
our brains are extremely plastic. Again, it doesn&#39;t talk specifically  <br/>
about counting and multiplication, but that was certainly my take-away  <br/>
from the research discussed in the book.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, in about 5 minutes during an Inner Speed Secrets seminar,  <br/>
I&#39;ve coached a middle-aged man to count backwards from 100 by 7s. If  <br/>
these people can learn to do that at 50 years old, why can&#39;t a teen  <br/>
learn to count by 5s, or 10s, or 2s, or to memorize multiplication  <br/>
tables (which is what most are really doing, right? They are just  <br/>
memorizing them - not learning what they mean).<br/>
<br/>
Those are my thoughts. No research to back up my opinions, though. But  <br/>
that book might provide some insight. If the question is, &quot;Do neural  <br/>
pathways close?&quot; then I know the answer is a big fat NO.&quot;<br/>

*anyone* being able to go through the first many years of life, in a rich,<br/>
joyful, unschooling environment, never being exposed to the reality of<br/>
numbers and their meaningful manipulation -- as it directly applies to their<br/>
lives!! (H began receiving a stipend at age 4 and could figure out 10%<br/>
discounts and 6% tax by age 5 -- it was his money, this was important<br/>
stuff!!)<br/>
<br/>
Math, as in the ruination of the joy of number manipulation by school<br/>
systems, is absolutely unnecessary!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-829896652">OK if this were true how would she explain how people with traumatic<br/>
brain injuries &quot;relearn&quot; how to walk, talk, speak, resume their lives<br/>
and jobs etc???   I think the brain is way more malleable than we ever<br/>
give it credit for!   I also have a special needs child with<br/>
significant language issues who at almost 13 continues to learn new<br/>
concepts every day through her daily life.  Yes some things are more<br/>
directly presented to her but most things are because she&#39;s asked what<br/>
this or that is called or what it does etc.   She also recently<br/>
presented to me this cool thing she had figured out.... if you count<br/>
&quot;nickels&quot; you can tell time... hmmmmm sounds like her neural pathways<br/>
are doing just fine!   (By the way this child on MRI shows a smaller<br/>
than &quot;normal&quot; hippocampus(long term memory and spatial reasoning) and<br/>
cerebellum (motor control and sensory perception).   At age 4 we were<br/>
told by the school system she was &quot;hopeless&quot;.  For the record she&#39;s<br/>
also an AMAZING artist... without a single art lesson.  <br/>
Sounds like the education crowd has found another scare tactic to<br/>
justify parents paying a zillion dollars to tutoring companies and<br/>
educational &quot;specialists&quot; !<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1839115301">Well, we learn things differently at different ages.  That you can<br/>
never learn them after a certain age?  Strikes me as misinterpreting<br/>
information.<br/>
<br/>
Think of it this way -- everyone pretty much agrees that young<br/>
children are wired to learn languages, and so many introduce many<br/>
languages to their young children, to help them have a leg up on that.<br/>
 Does that mean that after a certain age, you can&#39;t learn a new<br/>
language?  Of course not!  My bil and sil learned Swedish and Greek<br/>
before assignments in those countries.  They were adults.  <br/>
<br/>
And one nephew learned Spanish young -- and lost it all from disuse.<br/>
<br/>
My ds is 16, and learning French -- and acing the class, taking the<br/>
language labs that best help him learn to hear and speak it, and is<br/>
thinking some in French.  (It annoyed him at first, but now he&#39;s used<br/>
to it.)  <br/>
<br/>
I once tutored a girl who had learned her math facts for school --<br/>
then, a few years later, was working to get back up to speed for<br/>
another school, and had forgotten them.  I just had her make a chart<br/>
to refer to when she needed it -- and they came back in no time.  I<br/>
never once drilled her in it.  If that had been a critical make or<br/>
break time for memorizing multiplication facts, she would have<br/>
remembered in the first place!<br/>

<br/>
Exactly!<br/>
From what I&#39;ve read and learned about neural pathways, is that we grow<br/>
them up to a certain age, yes. But once we&#39;ve grown that neural<br/>
pathway it&#39;s always there. The brain begins to &quot;turn off&quot; the ones<br/>
that aren&#39;t used regularly but if we were to stimulate our brains in a<br/>
way that utilize that &quot;off&quot; neural pathway, it will begin to work again.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why a child that is blind from birth is not able to have those<br/>
bionicle eyes they&#39;re experimenting with now....the sight neural<br/>
pathways never got developed, so the brain wouldn&#39;t know what to do<br/>
with that information.<br/>
<br/>
What stimulates neural pathways to grow in young children? I believe<br/>
being held a lot, talked to, played with and raised in a nourishing<br/>
environment gives a person all the neural pathways they&#39;ll need for<br/>
the rest of their life learning.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1402509102">&quot;It really continues to blow my mind how those with a vested interest (and<br/>
payoff), think it&#39;s okay to make stuff up to give credence to all the<br/>
bullshit theories that fly around about the way we learn. We - I mean they -<br/>
are *so* brainwashed in this culture! I am oh so grateful to be aligned with<br/>
the &#39;real experts on children and learning&#39;! Thanks y&#39;all :)<br/>
<br/>
Jodi&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I always find it helpful to remember that the reason most people stubbornly<br/>
cling to excuses justifying forced learning (hahaha! The term &quot;forced<br/>
learning&quot; is such a hilarious oxymoron- like it could be justified!) is that<br/>
it&#39;s too painful.  Can you imagine, in our culture that promotes guilt, how<br/>
it would feel for most people to come to the horrifying realization of the<br/>
unnecessary pain inflicted upon them as children?  And the pain of knowing<br/>
they have done, or are doing the same thing to their own children? (or, in<br/>
the case of many teachers, other people&#39;s children)?  So painful, in fact,<br/>
that their minds cannot see it.  Their minds will continue to create excuses<br/>
to justify their experience.    That&#39;s the cycle of abuse, isn&#39;t it?  How<br/>
often do you hear adults say that they &quot;deserved&quot; to be hit or punished in<br/>
some other way when they were children?  It&#39;s the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I think most of us who are able to see it either come from a background that<br/>
was either a little bit closer to RU than mainstream (leaving that little<br/>
window open where we could see that it could be better), or was so damaging<br/>
that pain was dulled enough so we could see through it-  or maybe we&#39;re just<br/>
made of tougher stuff ? :-)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easy to be angry about it, especially when confronted directly by<br/>
someone who believes and defends all the bullshit theories, but<br/>
compassionate understanding puts you in a more empowered place. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-275073493">This is the reply from my cousin at MIT- the &quot;expert&quot;- I forwarded him <br/>
the same link:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;good find. i like the objective tone and seemingly very reasonable<br/>
 </span></blockquote>stance taken by this article. citations would be nice, though. i think<br/>
you are right that making a blanket statement about particular ages<br/>
related to that particular aspect of learning is not supported by<br/>
current evidence in the field. however, what the article says about<br/>
differences in learning over life stages is fairly well accepted. so<br/>
as always its not so black and white. there may be a greater ability<br/>
to learn certain math skills at certain stages of life, but saying<br/>
anything so specific as what the other parent claimed is not currently<br/>
substantiated, to my knowledge.&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Anyway- this is the cousin that made a major &quot;detour&quot; with 2 yrs in <br/>
prison on an arson charge after struggling through high school and a <br/>
suicide attempt.<br/>
<br/>
Here is his more current bio:<br/>
received a B.S. in computer science in 2002 and a Ph.D. in cognitive and <br/>
neural systems in 2007. His doctoral work focused on characterizing the <br/>
geometry of primary visual cortex in human using surface-based analysis <br/>
of structural magnetic resonance images. His interests include <br/>
understanding how spatial representations in cortex facilitate brain <br/>
function and developing methods to harness these representations for <br/>
novel applications. Now a Postdoctoral Associate.<br/>
<br/>
Fancy. Anyway, he likes his job a lot, plays in a band, lives frugally, <br/>
collects Jane Fonda workout books and videos, and has a super sense of <br/>
humor, and I think he is just about the coolest person in my family <br/>
though my grandmother can&#39;t get over his hair - you think she could over <br/>
look that considering!<br/>
<br/>
Even if there are &#39;sensitive&#39; periods when is may be easier for children <br/>
in general to learn some certain skill- the benefits of introducing that <br/>
skill when a child has no interest and in the worst case insisting that <br/>
a child learn during this time period due to fear of any kind is <br/>
completely outweighed by my personal experience over and over that <br/>
neural pathways are not at their most effective under coercion, stress, <br/>
and fear. And my children are not children in general, they are <br/>
individuals who know best when their own neural pathways are ready to <br/>
learn any certain thing. BTW, they both seem to pretty much &quot;get&quot; basic <br/>
arithmetic-though have not memorized all the facts - my daughter mainly <br/>
through her love of shopping- IRL and online shopping games.<br/>
<br/>
I wish people would be more careful with their &quot;facts and figures&quot; and <br/>
not use them as scare tactics. I think this woman has got a whole bunch <br/>
of home schoolers believing that their children will never multiply if <br/>
they aren&#39;t made to do it right now, and who knows what other dire <br/>
consequences- probably that they will be on the couch at 30- wait a <br/>
minute, that was my uncle- didn&#39;t he go to public school?<br/>
<br/>
Excerpts from the article:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Evidence is now accumulating that our emotions do re-sculpt<br/>
neural tissue. In situations of excessive stress or intense fear, social <br/>
judgment and cognitive<br/>
performance suffer through compromise to the neural processes of <br/>
emotional regulation.<br/>
Some stress is essential to meet challenges and can lead to better <br/>
cognition and learning, but<br/>
beyond a certain level it has the opposite effect.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like school, possibly? Excessive stress, intense fear, social <br/>
judgement?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Concerning positive emotions, one of most<br/>
powerful triggers that motivates people to learn is the illumination <br/>
that comes with the<br/>
grasp of new concepts – the brain responds very well to this. A primary <br/>
goal of early<br/>
education should be to ensure that children have this experience of <br/>
“enlightenment” as early<br/>
as possible and become aware of just how pleasurable learning can be.<br/>
Managing one’s emotions is one of the key skills of being an effective <br/>
learner; self-regulation<br/>
is one of the most important behavioural and emotional skills that <br/>
children and older people<br/>
need in their social environments.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like unschooling to me! Becoming aware of the pleasures of <br/>
learning and self regulating. Though that doesn&#39;t sound quite as much <br/>
fun as we are having-<br/>

In an unschooling family, a child will have toys to play with and<br/>

and lots of chances to naturally encounter numbers. Of course. I think<br/>
in most any healthy family a child will develop those neural pathways<br/>
without a thought as to exposure because math is all around us.<br/>
<br/>
A child left out in nature with no human interaction might not develop<br/>
those neural pathways...but maybe they would. Because there has been<br/>
some evidence of feral children learning all sorts of things nobody<br/>
thought they could learn after they were found. Not great evidence<br/>
there, because in most of those cases the scientists turned the poor<br/>
child into a case study and they never had a normal family life which<br/>
would give us a better look at just what neural pathways HAD formed<br/>
without a healthy start.<br/>
<br/>
I think we don&#39;t really know the mysteries of the brain. I believe<br/>
wholeheartedly that in a nourishing family all the neural pathways a<br/>
person needs will develop just fine. Math and all (which is really<br/>
about patterns and sequence and logic).<br/>

 I am sure that is true, but so what? It is inconceivable that any child would lack the necessary <br/>
exposure to the world in order for this to happen. Although there was a case years ago of a <br/>
young girl who was imprisoned at home by her parents and not allowed to communicate with <br/>
people; she apparently failed to develop left-hemisphere language ability. Whether she might <br/>
have been able to do so eventually is unclear, since she was delivered into the hands of <br/>
people who were more interested in studying her that in relating to her. See &quot;Genie: A <br/>

like I am always shifting, learning, getting it more and more each day.  <br/>
sometimes, the directness of this group is INTENSE, but I&#39;ve never really seen  <br/>
anything personally directed - but lost of challenging going on - in a good way. <br/>
 <br/>
Well, not too sure of my point anymore, but yeah. lol. <br/>
 <br/>
Love to all, and thanks to all,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1877002518">Ren, <br/>
    To address  your question about feral children etc.... I have a<br/>
friend who had the distinction of being the worst case of child abuse<br/>
in Northern VA history at one point.   He was the second of 3<br/>
children... an older brother and younger sister were never abused (it<br/>
was discovered during his adulthood that neither of his &quot;parents&quot; were<br/>
genetically linked to him although no adoption records have been<br/>
found)    At any rate... he never attended school, at various times in<br/>
his life he was made to live in an abandoned barn on the property his<br/>
father managed (a large horse farm).   He was abused in so many ways<br/>
it&#39;s just heartbreaking to even contemplate.   His xrays light up like<br/>
a Christmas tree he has so many breaks and heal overs.   He can tell<br/>
you which household chemicals do the least damage when ingested and<br/>
which ones only get worse when water is consumed after them.   He<br/>
knows how long you can go without food before you pass out and lots of<br/>
other horribly useful things if you are being tortured!  <br/>
<br/>
All that said... he ended up in foster care at age 17 when he snapped<br/>
and almost killed his father during an episode of abuse.    He was put<br/>
into a school program and basically completed an entire school career<br/>
and got a high school diploma in just a few years then went on to<br/>
college and did very well.     I have had many conversations with him<br/>
about his past because it just amazes me that he developed at all.  <br/>
He said he played alot of math and logic games in his head...<br/>
evidently he had learned to count at some point (perhaps as a toddler<br/>
before the abuse began?)   he was able to take that simple skill and<br/>
although he didnt know what it was called he learned to add, subtract,<br/>
multiply and divide just by knowing how to count.  So my thought is<br/>
that there are very minimal &quot;math&quot; type things that really HAVE to be<br/>
taught to develop those type of neural pathways.  His main deficit was<br/>
language... he had made up lots of names for things because he didn&#39;t<br/>
know what they were really called but basically he made his own<br/>
language so in all actuality language was not a weakness English was!<br/>
  He of course has all the emotional baggage, lots of sensory issues<br/>
and so forth (you should have seen him the first time he tasted Pepsi!<br/>
)    Anyway he&#39;s quite a neat person to know ... and he assures my<br/>
children that he WAS raised in a barn but doesn&#39;t leave doors open!   <br/>
Anyway just thought you would find that interesting!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; A child left out in nature with no human interaction might not develop<br/>
&gt; those neural pathways...but maybe they would. Because there has been<br/>
&gt; some evidence of feral children learning all sorts of things nobody<br/>
&gt; thought they could learn after they were found. Not great evidence<br/>
&gt; there, because in most of those cases the scientists turned the poor<br/>
&gt; child into a case study and they never had a normal family life which<br/>
&gt; would give us a better look at just what neural pathways HAD formed<br/>
&gt; without a healthy start.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think we don&#39;t really know the mysteries of the brain. I believe<br/>
&gt; wholeheartedly that in a nourishing family all the neural pathways a<br/>
&gt; person needs will develop just fine. Math and all (which is really<br/>
&gt; about patterns and sequence and logic).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-987315310">Hi Erin-<br/>
<br/>
Not to challenge you personally, but do you have any specific links, <br/>
books, articles that would support the idea that neural pathways close? <br/>
I have posted the article that I posted her on our local list, and the <br/>
woman that originally made the statement thanked me, but says:<br/>
<br/>
    There are a certain number of synapses that close during the<br/>
    &#39;growing&#39; years due to environment and types of learning. It is<br/>
    thought that there is a certain synapse configuration that causes<br/>
    mental retardation and autism.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t find anything like this in my search- but thought you might <br/>
have some information about this- inferred from your post quoted below:<br/>

have left to eat at dinnertime. I don&#39;t think I really need to <br/>
demonstrate how math is used from an early age, but without this <br/>
exposure, indeed, I *do* believe the literature that tells us these <br/>
pathways will close.<br/>
<br/>
In addition:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I found this below to be very true- as one of a very few unschoolers and <br/>
maybe one of 2 radical unschoolers in the midst of a large group of <br/>
school at home families- in order to have my views be seen as rational <br/>
and not raving lunacy I find it very important to be compassionate and <br/>
unfailingly polite. I usually avoid discussion, but lately am feeling up <br/>
to the challenge! Empowered. We all care deeply about our children, we <br/>
just have very different ways of viewing our role as caring parent.<br/>

  This question caught my attention as a *very* valid one.  I can&#39;t speak for anyone else, but for me it took a loooooong time to even have an inkling of what my interests are.  I remember going to a course called &quot;Life Directions&quot; about 10 years ago and being completely overwhelmed (at age 30) by all the questions about what I love, what draws me, what fascinates me, because it was all one gigantic *blank*.  Those who were making decisions for me back then - parents, educators, religious leaders - did one hell of a job of denying me the opportunity to even know it was okay to *have* my own interests, so much so that at age 41 it&#39;s something I still struggle with - knowing myself, knowing what I&#39;m passionate about.  I really believe that the pathways wired for passion, joy, interest, purpose, self-regulation, self-referencing, love, etc. are so crucial to be concerned about - these are what make us *happy* imo .<br/>

I am sure that is true, but so what? It is inconceivable that any child would lack the necessary <br/>
exposure to the world in order for this to happen. Although there was a case years ago of a <br/>
young girl who was imprisoned at home by her parents and not allowed to communicate with <br/>
people; she apparently failed to develop left-hemisphere language ability. Whether she might <br/>
have been able to do so eventually is unclear, since she was delivered into the hands of <br/>
people who were more interested in studying her that in relating to her. See &quot;Genie: A <br/>

  Yet again, so often what you write is so much on the lines that I am at!! I am also working on remembering what I like to do at 39 yet!!!  Even more reason that I am following the unschooling path I do not want to rob my children of that ability!!<br/>

passion for that was rather powerful...and as time passed, and more and more  <br/>
controlling schooling came my way, my interst waned and it became about the  things <br/>
I *couldn&#39;t* have, not about the things *I* wanted to be and have. I  totally <br/>
understand that...and some of those feelings are what brought me here to  <br/>
unschooling. <br/>
