<div id="ygrps-yiv-809996109">Hello I am not sure if i had posted a newcommer message or not to this<br/>
list since I belong to a few lists.  My daughter who is 9 started<br/>
homeschooling with me about two months ago, after a month of doing 6<br/>
subjects a day we found it to be just not fun and caused alot of<br/>
stress.  I then learned about unschooling and we tried this for about 3<br/>
weeks and found her attitude to become better at first then she thought<br/>
she ran the house hold.  So we have changed some things and found that a<br/>
combination of relaxed homeschool and unschooling with certain limits<br/>
works best for her personality and ours.<br/>
<br/>
Here is what we came up with and she seems absolutely fine with it.<br/>
<br/>
Every day she is allowed on my computer for 1 hour upon waking.  then<br/>
she must have breakfast, read the bible or watch a bible video, then..<br/>
<br/>
Mondays 1 worksheet of math or a computer game with math<br/>
Tuesday Reading or online science or hands on.<br/>
Wednesday Reading or online geography or history<br/>
Thursday Writing a story on the computer or in her journal<br/>
Friday Cooking (as she has shown a lot of interest here)<br/>
<br/>
 From 11:30am to bedtime the rest of each day is free to do as she pleases.<br/>
<br/>
It has worked so much better for all of this way .<br/>

Why did she think she ran the household? That&#39;s not what unschooling <br/>
is.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I may be wrong (it wouldn&#39;t be the first time) but this is not <br/>
unschooling, it&#39;s eclectic homeschooling. There&#39;s nothing wrong with <br/>
that but it&#39;s not unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m curious though,.... what happens if she wants to stay on the <br/>
computer for 90 minutes or she doesn&#39;t feel like reading the bible <br/>
one day. And also, what happens if she wants to cook on Wednesday? <br/>
<br/>
Please understand I&#39;m not finding fault with what you&#39;re doing. I&#39;m <br/>
only questioning the use of the word unschooling in your <br/>
description. You said it&#39;s a combination of unschooling and relaxed <br/>
homeschooling and I&#39;m guessing that the relaxed homeschooling part <br/>
is what you posted, the scheduled and required school work and the <br/>
unschooling part is letting her do whatever she wants from 11:30 on. <br/>
The first part is correct, that seems like relaxed/eclectic <br/>
homeschooling BUT the other part is not unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;d like to move towards unschooling, you&#39;ve come to the right <br/>
place. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-544353568">I think it&#39;s great you made changes and going from six subjects a day  to <br/>
where you at now. It is a nice step towards relaxing.<br/>
That said..............<br/>
This is an unschooling list. Unschoolers do not force teach,demand or  <br/>
brainwash.<br/>
I&#39;m sure someone may have a kinder gentler way to say it.<br/>
 <br/>
Being allowed to use the computer for 1 hr a day is very little time  to <br/>
explore. Prisoners get more computer time...<br/>
She must have breakfast? Does every other member have to eat  breakfast every <br/>
day? I know I don&#39;t eat food every am. What if she doesn&#39;t  want it? What if <br/>
she doesn&#39;t finish what happens?<br/>
What is her *required time to wake up?<br/>
 <br/>
What does she like to do?<br/>
Do you go places just for fun?<br/>
 <br/>
So your saying you have no plans to unschool? What you explain is  relaxed <br/>
homeschooling. What part of what we do are you interested in?  <br/>
You say &quot;she seems absolutely fine with it&quot;. Many kids are fine with  PS. <br/>
Would she be allowed to tell you if she wasn&#39;t?<br/>
 <br/>
