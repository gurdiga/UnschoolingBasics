Actually, it&#39;s much lower than that, I think. I read a recent report titled Tapestry of Homeschoolers -- it&#39;s online at learningis4everyone.org (I&#39;m on a borrowed laptop with limited search functions) -- based on a survey of homeschoolers nationwide (I participated when someone sent me the link).  Answers in that survey indicated it&#39;s more like 30% of people who homeschool for religious reasons (of which Evangelicals would be a sub-group).  75% is way too high!<br/>
 <br/>
The HSLDA would like for Americans to think that all homeschoolers are Evangelical Christians, but it&#39;s just not true. <br/>

**Nobody knows exactly, of course, but that number sounds wildly off-base to me.<br/>
<br/>
**OTOH, &quot;statistics&quot; and other &quot;facts&quot; are invented by the non-reality-based community with an appalling regularity. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>lol I was going to write back saying sure its 75% if you go by HSLDA statistics ...meaning 75% of HSLDA members say they are evangelical christians<br/>

Ah, but you&#39;re comparing different things here, that just look the same.   :) <br/>
The fact that only 30% of the survey said that they are homeschooling for <br/>
religious reasons does NOT mean that only 30% are religious or that some smaller <br/>
number are evangelical christians. All of them could have been evangelical <br/>
christians, or none. We don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
Few of the folks I know would say they are homeschooling for religious <br/>
reasons, but most of them are religious, and of the Christian homeschoolers I know <br/>
personally, most are evangelicals who yet would not list religious reasons as <br/>
their main reason for homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Frankly, I&#39;d not be surprised or shocked if it really is true that 75% of all <br/>
homeschoolers are Evangelical Christians. :::shrug:::   <br/>
