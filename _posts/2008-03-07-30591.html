<div id="ygrps-yiv-1743626199">Hello to all,<br/>
I recently read &quot;With Consent&quot; by Jan Fortune-Wood (I think I got the <br/>
name right), about living consensually with your children and <br/>
the &quot;Taking Children Seriously&quot; thoughts on that.  It seemed pretty <br/>
much like radical unschooling to me.  It gave me a bolstered <br/>
conviction to treat my children like human beings with equal rights <br/>
and I was encouraged, yet again, that I have found this way to live <br/>
while my kids are small so I don&#39;t have to undo so much damage I <br/>
would&#39;ve otherwise inflicted on them had I raised them mindlessly.  I <br/>
liked the discussion on &quot;compromise&quot; not being good enough because <br/>
someone is still losing and to look for win-win solutions, and that <br/>
they&#39;re always there even if we fail to find them in a given <br/>
situation.  I also liked the emphasis that it takes creativity to <br/>
live consensually and to find those win-win solutions.  It really <br/>
sounded a lot like what I hear on these unschooling boards, so wanted <br/>
to ask the opinion of some of our more thoughtful, experienced and <br/>
developed unschoolers...<br/>
<br/>
Am I missing some nefarious nuance? :)<br/>
