<div id="ygrps-yiv-1476291556">Hi Laura<br/>
<br/>
Take a breath - it will work out. Keep in mind that many of us are not<br/>
in West Virginia so these questions may not make any sense to what you<br/>
need but here goes:<br/>
1 - is there an alternate to doing a portfolio that feels okay to you?<br/>
Some places allow testing, portfolio, or &quot;alternate evaluation&quot;<br/>
2 - what do you mean by &quot;can&#39;t find anyone to do it&quot;? Do you mean you<br/>
can&#39;t find anyone to evaluate the portfolio or you can&#39;t find anyone to<br/>
make the portfolio for you?<br/>
3 - does it have to be submitted by June 30th for sure? Or just at the<br/>
&#39;end of the school year&#39;? (like I said, I don&#39;t know the details of WV<br/>
law since I&#39;m in CT where there is no homeschooling law)<br/>
<br/>
My limited understanding of WV laws indicates that you can either<br/>
administer a standardized test or you can be evaluated by a certified<br/>
teacher. Is the &quot;can&#39;t find anyone&quot; related to not being able to find a<br/>
certified teacher? If so, that&#39;s something you&#39;d need to sort out with a<br/>
local group or list - they&#39;re the ones who&#39;d know about people locally.<br/>
I did a quick search for Yahoo groups using &quot;west Virginia homeschool&quot;<br/>
and found at least half a dozen yahoo groups. I&#39;m sure some of the folks<br/>
there would be more than willing to help out (you might even find<br/>
someone who homeschools who has kept up her/his certification in order<br/>
to do evals).<br/>
<br/>
