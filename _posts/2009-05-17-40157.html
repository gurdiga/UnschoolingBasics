  I enjoyed this response because my boy is in school.  and some of the suggestions I do already  -- like having him pick the clothes out the night before or I do if he wants me to (often he asks me too).  I try to be in a good mood (not always easy! -- rather not get up tee hee) , they offer free breakfast at school so that helps with not having to wake up even earlier. I still walk out every morning to the bus and drive him often when asked (and pick him up) . I volunteer once a week in the class and try to do things with the pta.  (funny side note though the president of the pta and treasurer is homeschooling their children next year:)  <br/>
  So I guess I am grasping unschooling more and more and I am aware of my kids more!!   good gut instinct to post for us with schooled kids:)!! thank you<br/>
