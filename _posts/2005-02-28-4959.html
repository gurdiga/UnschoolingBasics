<div id="ygrps-yiv-239332932">&quot;My strewing so far isn&#39;t making any connections.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Strewing doesn&#39;t have to involve any conversation at all though. Are <br/>
you leaving some interesting books/materials out on the table or <br/>
where he can bump into them?  Are you pinning up calenders of <br/>
interesting happenings around town?<br/>
It doesn&#39;t need to be a discussion of &quot;what are you interested in?&quot; <br/>
as he probably doesn&#39;t know right now.<br/>
<br/>
Are you finding things that interest YOU? Are you inviting him to <br/>
join you in your learning adventures and explorations? Strewing is a <br/>
mindset and sometimes it takes a while to really &quot;get there&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s restless, good..that means he&#39;s probably healed a lot. It&#39;s <br/>
time to find new and interesting things to do. School doesn&#39;t solve <br/>
any of that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, mostly it&#39;s book, games, printouts of things from the net. I<br/>
don&#39;t discuss things with him generally unless he shows an interest or<br/>
desire on his own first. Like this afternoon he wanted to know when<br/>
we&#39;re getting our chickens. I showed him my garden/farm binder that<br/>
I&#39;ve been working on --full of drawings, lists, and seed orders. I use<br/>
a 3 ring binder with clear plastic sleeves. One is for the McMurray<br/>
Hatchery, with our chick order and list of things to do to get ready<br/>
for our chicks next month, and then a list of things that need to done<br/>
by the time they go outside. He looked through the catalog at the<br/>
drawings of the chicks we&#39;re getting. He asked if he could get an<br/>
exotic chick, so I said we&#39;d need to do some research to make sure the<br/>
others would get along with it, or choose a breed that would live<br/>
harmoniously with the layers. I mentioned that the 4-H small animals<br/>
group will be starting their projects this month, so he asked if he<br/>
could go and start the chicken project.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m finally in a place (location ,and in life) where I am ready to<br/>
focus on manifesting the life that feels most true to  me, which is<br/>
starting a market garden business. He&#39;s somewhat interested in<br/>
learning with me, but I don&#39;t intend to force him to participate. He&#39;s<br/>
wanting to earn money so he can buy a laptop. He has a computer that<br/>
we bought, but we can&#39;t afford a laptop at this time. We can afford to<br/>
hire him to help with some of the work in the gardens and going to<br/>
market, which he thinks he&#39;s interested in, so he can save up.<br/>
Thinking and doing, being two different animals, of course. We&#39;ll see<br/>
how it feels to him once we begin. Right now it&#39;s planning, and he&#39;s<br/>
very interested in helping with that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Exactly. School caused the damage that he had to heal from. <br/>

Thank you.<br/>
