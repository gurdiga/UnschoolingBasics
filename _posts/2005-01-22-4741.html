<div id="ygrps-yiv-984891594">I just re-read my post and it sounds like I would be using some kind <br/>
of schedule. No LOL. I do understand the principles of unschooling.<br/>
They will learn when they want what they want. When I was a child <br/>
(heck I am still like that!)I used to read entire enciclopedias and <br/>
do math on work books for fun during the holidays.<br/>
I just wished my mom had unschooled me. In a way she help me be open <br/>
to it.<br/>
I learned so much more outside of school. And its not to say I did <br/>
not like school. I loved it. But always tought it was a waste of time <br/>
all those hours there. ( So I usually read a book during class- Had <br/>
to hide it of course) I had great grades and I have a JD (Graduaded <br/>
from Law School). Well I just wanted to clarify that.<br/>
I am just trying to learn more here (already read great info on past <br/>
posts).<br/>
The other thing that might be a little different is that I live in <br/>
the US and my son is bilingual. Dad is American. So my son speaks <br/>
both Portuguese and English. Any good info on unschooling bilingual <br/>
children?<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
