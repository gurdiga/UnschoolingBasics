<div id="ygrps-yiv-13835489">Hi, all! I&#39;m new to the group, and just wanted to say hello. My name is  <br/>
Karen and I&#39;m unschooling my youngest 2, Julian who is 4 3/4 and Julia who will  <br/>
be 2 really soon :) I also am gently getting my oldest son, 17, into  <br/>
unschooling, trying to help him learn to trust himself, and all kinds of good  stuff. <br/>
My daughter, Grace, is in conventional school right now, but I am hoping  that <br/>
will change in time - and soon! (my first set, aka, &quot;Group 1&quot; lol, are my  <br/>
kids from my first marriage to a very conventional man, they were all  <br/>
conventionally &quot;educated&quot; and I am not trying to undo the mess that created).  Anyway, <br/>
that&#39;s me! <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks to my friend Bebe for introducing me to this list! I&#39;m really  <br/>
enjoying the conversations and am loving the time I&#39;m having with my kids. <br/>
Karen <br/>
