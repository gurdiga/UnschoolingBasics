<div id="ygrps-yiv-1698355897"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I think the one thing unschooled kids miss out on is experiencing<br/>
&gt;school. ;-) *We* (the unschooling parents) can speak with authority<br/>
&gt;about how much better unschooling is because we&#39;ve experienced both.<br/>
&gt;We can point out to schooling parents who want to argue that their<br/>
&gt;opinion on how learning must be is skewed because they&#39;ve never<br/>
&gt;experienced unschooling. Our kids are more like schooling parents in<br/>
&gt;that they&#39;ve only experienced unschooling. They can&#39;t speak with<br/>
&gt;authority on how much better it is. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In my case, my parents didn&#39;t think much of the public school system. They <br/>
sometimes did my homework so I could play! I was unschooled from 12 on, so I <br/>
have some idea of the difference, but it&#39;s the whole &quot;High School&quot; thing <br/>
that she wants. In listening to her, I think she likes the idea of a group <br/>
of people unified in the same situation, good or bad. It&#39;s like she finds <br/>
unity in the idea of being where her friends are.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;And how can she truly know what crap it is until she&#39;s experienced<br/>
&gt;it? Isn&#39;t that what unschooling is about: letting them learn by<br/>
&gt;experience rather than by telling?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is why we are letting her do it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Though some kids do pick up the damage that school does to their<br/>
&gt;friends and will have an opinion on what they have to go through to<br/>
&gt;learn, it really isn&#39;t the same as experiencing it first hand.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One thing is that she has been very vocal about the crap they are making her <br/>
do just to get in, so she is going into it with realistic expectations.<br/>
