Check it out! We had a lot of entries and if anyone wants to<br/>
participate in the September blog carnival, the topic is up at the<br/>

If you click on &quot;forum&quot; at the top of the page, it brings up all the<br/>
discussion categories. Blog carnival is listed at the very bottom and<br/>
the September topic is there along with any and all discussion related<br/>
