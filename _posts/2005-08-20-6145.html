<div id="ygrps-yiv-1826526288">We almost never use many minutes, and we don&#39;t tend to keep the things on.  <br/>
But they&#39;re handy to have.<br/>
 <br/>
I just got a Tracfone. They&#39;re pay-as-you-go, so the per-minute chrage is  <br/>
higher, but it&#39;s cheaper for what I need. They have a good deal: $19.99 for a  <br/>
basic phone and 40 minute card of time. If you let me refer you, you get an  <br/>
extra 100 minutes, and I get 100 too. (You don&#39;t have to let me refer you. I&#39;ll  <br/>
love you anyway.)  The site is _http://tracfone.com_ (http://tracfone.com)  <br/>
 <br/>
To keep the phone active you have to buy a new card every 60-365 days,  <br/>
depending on the denomination of the card. For example, the 40 minute card this  <br/>
thing came with gives me 2 months time. So, with a phone, that&#39;s less than $10 a <br/>
 month. No activation fees, and if you activate your cards online (you can <br/>
also  buy the cards in stores, or activate by phone) they add extra minutes.<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway....the phones are not sexy, and if you talk a lot on them, you&#39;re  <br/>
probably better off with a regular plan. But to send with the kids if they&#39;re  <br/>
away or at friends, or for emergencies, they seem practical.<br/>
 <br/>
If you&#39;re open to me referring you, send me an e-mail at _KathrynJB@..._ <br/>
(mailto:KathrynJB@...)  and they&#39;ll send you an  e-mail link. <br/>
