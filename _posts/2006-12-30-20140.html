&gt;   Hi Tami,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I understand how you feel. I have had to work hard to let go of<br/>
&gt; &quot;perfectionism&quot; myself. www.flylady.net has helped me tremendously! My<br/>
&gt; house stays fairly straightened. I just have to be careful to do ONLY what<br/>
&gt; she tells me to do daily and not go way overboard and try to do everything<br/>
&gt; perfectly. Hope you find this helpful.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Help for my OCD-like characteristics re:<br/>
&gt; clutter<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; New question here...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am the grown daughter of an obsessive-compulsive parent. OCD is funny<br/>
&gt; when you<br/>
&gt; watch it on MONK, but in real life, its horrible. You&#39;ve heard the phrase<br/>
&gt; &quot;a place for<br/>
&gt; everything, and everything in its place&quot;, but with my dad, this was taken<br/>
&gt; to a new level. I<br/>
&gt; remember more than one occassion being jerked out of bed in the middle of<br/>
&gt; the night<br/>
&gt; because something was a couple of inches out of place and it was my<br/>
&gt; responsibility to<br/>
&gt; align it PERFECTLY before being allowed to go back to sleep.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Althought *I* do not have OCD, it has been ingrained in me that things<br/>
&gt; have to be<br/>
&gt; cleaned/picked up/put away PERFECTLY. I have worked very hard to overcome<br/>
&gt; this part of<br/>
&gt; my upbringing, and I&#39;ve done quite well in a lot of areas. I&#39;ve lowered my<br/>
&gt; standards on<br/>
&gt; cleanliness to a point I never thought possible (for instance, I can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; remember the last time<br/>
&gt; I cleaned the bathrooms - hows that for lowered standards!). But...I have<br/>
&gt; 3 young children<br/>
&gt; (5.5, 4, 2) with 3 seperate interests and the clutter is tearing me apart<br/>
&gt; on the inside. I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; gone thru the archives, but have only seen stuff on picking up/cleaning<br/>
&gt; relating to &quot;have<br/>
&gt; to vs. choose to&quot;, which I don&#39;t feel applies to me. Because of my<br/>
&gt; upbringing, mentally<br/>
&gt; &quot;letting go&quot; of the mess is not something I feel I can do. It causes such<br/>
&gt; incredible anxiety<br/>
&gt; in me that sometimes I have trouble breathing! I have come to understand<br/>
&gt; thru reading<br/>
&gt; Sandra Dodd&#39;s site that if something bothers me, then it is *my*<br/>
&gt; responsibility to clean it<br/>
&gt; up. But...I feel I like I am *always* picking up and sacrificing time with<br/>
&gt; my kids in order to<br/>
&gt; do this. I don&#39;t wont to sacrfice my time/relationship with them, but I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; not sure how to<br/>
&gt; overcome something that has been so deeply ingrained in me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyone have any suggestions?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
&gt; Tami<br/>
