Unschooling Gathering - Camping on Jersey Shore<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
A group (quickly growing in size) of unschooling families will be camping at Allaire State Park&#39;s camp ground in Monmouth  County, NJ, from August 26th through September 5th this summer and would welcome other unschoolers joining the group for all or part of that time.  There are still many sites available.  We&#39;ve done this in past years and it&#39;s always nice to have other families coming and going throughout the week.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
In the past while camping with multiple families, we&#39;ve kept it pretty flexible and loose not doing too much planning so that families and individuals can follow their own needs while providing a great group experience.  This camping trip is organized in such a fashion that being together doesn&#39;t mean anyone is obligated to follow anyone else&#39;s agenda or schedule, however, there is always a lot of overlap, shared meals, shared bike trips, beach trips, etc.  If we&#39;re a large group, we try not to complicate the trip by expecting or planning an entire group to do the same thing each day throughout the week.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The park is 15 minutes to Jersey Shore beaches (Blemar and Spring Lake).  Half hour to Island Beach State Park.  20 minutes to Point Pleasant.  3 miles from small grocery store and 6 miles to all major shopping amenities, restaurants and entertainment, etc.  10 minutes to County Park with canoe and Kayak rental for reservoir boating. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-719496709">We&#39;ve done camping trips over the years with fellow homeschoolers/unschoolers.  This year since we are not attending the L&L conference in NM my 13yo said we could still have an unschooling gathering locally.  While we had planned camping, this is what motivated the idea of targeting unschooling families to join us.  we have 7 families camping and another 3 families locally joining us for day activities.  <br/>
<br/>
There was some talk after the northeast unschooling conference about an unschooling camping gathering next spring in NH - tents, bunks and cabins - don&#39;t know about rv&#39;s.  If this comes together i am sure it will be posted on national lists.<br/>

Thanks, Lisa!  This is something the boys and I would love to <br/>
participate in the future.  We live in Michigan, so we hope to make <br/>
the Northeast Unschooling Conference next year if they have another <br/>
one.  <br/>
<br/>
Such exciting events to look forward to!<br/>
