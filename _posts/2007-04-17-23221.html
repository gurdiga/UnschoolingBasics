<div id="ygrps-yiv-1866006474">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
My 7 yo dh has a stuffed animal from a company called Webkinz.  As  <br/>
far as I can tell, it is a craze around here.  Every child I meet  <br/>
lately has multiple Webkinz animals.  Anyway, it&#39;s a &#39;beanie baby&quot;- <br/>
type stuffed animal that you buy at the store.  It comes with a tag  <br/>
that has a code that you can use on the internet.  Once you register  <br/>
you can take care of your animal - feed it, bathe it, buy items for  <br/>
it, etc.  You generate &quot;money&quot; to buy these things by playing games  <br/>
and winning points.<br/>
<br/>
Well, based on many of the recent threads on this list, I&#39;ve been  <br/>
trying really hard to be relaxed about this game, as well as computer  <br/>
use in general, which I have made some strides on.  So, I decided to  <br/>
try to appreciate certain benefits of the game, and I found some.   <br/>
For example, it has been a very social outlet for her, enabling her  <br/>
to talk to some children she had a harder time with in the past.   <br/>
Another example would be the day she came to me and was telling me  <br/>
about someone who had 500,000 points and I realized that she had seen  <br/>
and understood that number.<br/>
<br/>
One aspect of the website is that you can email friends on your  <br/>
&quot;friends list&quot; (it&#39;s essentially an Instant Messaging training  <br/>
system).  I was fine with this because she was getting the names of  <br/>
her friends and putting them on her list.  But now I found out that  <br/>
you can go to a &quot;Tournament Arena&quot;, play games against others (that  <br/>
you don&#39;t know) and &quot;meet&quot; them.  She was telling me about someone  <br/>
she was playing against (a game involving putting on dress-up clothes  <br/>
on your animal) and that this person asked Tess to be on her friends  <br/>
list.  Tess said, &quot;I said no, but I hope she asks me again because  <br/>
I&#39;ll say yes next time&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
So, I realized that she is imagining this person as a &quot;girl&quot;,  <br/>
probably as a 7 yo girl just like her, and that this is a friend  <br/>
(just like a 7 yo girl that she might meet in the park and become  <br/>
&quot;instant friends&quot; with for the moment that we are at the park).  But  <br/>
I started thinking that we really have no idea who this person is  <br/>
(when it&#39;s the park situation you really do know that the stranger is  <br/>
a 7 yo girl because you can see her, and become her &quot;friend&quot;, but on  <br/>
the internet this person could be absolutely anyone.  But, she has an  <br/>
image in her mind of safety.<br/>
<br/>
So, I told her that talking to people on the internet is just like  <br/>
meeting someone in the store or the park (for example Tess will not  <br/>
tell someone her name when she meets them unless she checks with me  <br/>
first) and that I would like to explore this part of Webkinz with her  <br/>
before she adds anyone to her list.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, I saw her list and it&#39;s got a lot of people on it.  Some  <br/>
of them are strangers she has met online (she told me), some of them  <br/>
are our neighbors and other friends.  I decided not to say much,  <br/>
because she was in the middle of a playdate, but I would like to talk  <br/>
to her about this more.  I didn&#39;t get a chance to talk to her before  <br/>
bed and now I&#39;ve woken up in the middle of the night and I can&#39;t go  <br/>
back to sleep because it&#39;s on my mind.<br/>
<br/>
I should say that the only email communication that I see on this  <br/>
website is from pre-programmed lists of messages that you choose  <br/>
from.  But, I don&#39;t know the website well enough, yet, to know if she  <br/>
can type in her own messages.  Even if the communication is strictly  <br/>
pre-programmed, I am concerned about a slippery slope effect.  I  <br/>
worry that this is dulling her to the idea that she can talk to  <br/>
anyone on the internet, and making it feel very safe for her.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any advice/comments you all have!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-626162790">We love Webkinz.  My kids spend a lot of time *working*, spending, <br/>
redecorating, building and playing with others.  They love the Wheel of WOW and Gem <br/>
Hunt. From the many hours I&#39;ve spent on Webkinz, I see no threat of danger.  My <br/>
only problem with it is the burger making job.  I keep having visions of my <br/>
daughter working at McDonalds as she is excelling at the Webkin burger job and <br/>
making big $.  <br/>
 <br/>
Since members of this list have forced me to question my own fears (pet store <br/>
guy and abduction threads a few weeks back) I think its good to be clearly in <br/>
touch with our fears and to be mindful not to pass them onto our children.  <br/>
Worst case on Webkinz might be that a 42 year old is playing and your <br/>
daughter&#39;s webkin visits his pool and shares some chicken nuggets.  He can&#39;t strip her <br/>
webkin of its bathing suit or drive to your house.  My daughter says to have <br/>
no fear because your daughter would have to want to go to visit another Webkin. <br/>
 The players get to decide.<br/>
 <br/>
Enjoy your time together,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ray meets people on Runescape pretty often. He&#39;s often excited about <br/>
something a new friend has told him and wants to share. So we listen <br/>
and chit-chat with him and learn about what he&#39;s doing and who he&#39;s <br/>
meeting that way. He knows that people aren&#39;t always who/what they <br/>
say they are bc sometimes he&#39;s not, either. He tells us that too. He <br/>
plays different ages and genders depending on his mood. He doesnsn&#39;t <br/>
see that as weird or creepy - its a game. Part of the fun is <br/>
pretending to be something you&#39;re not.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I see a different slippery slope.<br/>
Ray&#39;s girlfriend&#39;s mom regulates her my-space &quot;friends&quot; and screens <br/>
her email. So the girl gets up in the middle of the night and uses a <br/>
different name so her mom can&#39;t track her. Her mom is trying to <br/>
protect her, but is creating a *more* dangerous situation. If this <br/>
girl comes across something that disturbs her she&#39;s certainly not <br/>
going to tell mom. <br/>
<br/>
Ask your dd what she enjoys playing and who her friends are bc you <br/>
want to support her and share her delight. Certainly you can let her <br/>
know that sometimes people pretend to be somebody else online, but I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t try to scare her. If she&#39;s comfortable sharing her <br/>
experiences she&#39;ll let you know if someone is acting oddly or being <br/>
rude online. If you are talking about your own online experiences <br/>
you&#39;ll have opportunities to complain about trolls or spammers or <br/>
share how sometimes you can tell when a dad posts on a parenting <br/>
board even if he&#39;s using his dw&#39;s email address. <br/>
<br/>
The internet is a great way to meet people. Sure, people aren&#39;t <br/>
always who they say they are - you have no guarantee that *I&#39;m* <br/>
somebody&#39;s mom or an unschooler - how can you tell? <br/>
