<div id="ygrps-yiv-1329842886">Hi everyone,<br/>
Don&#39;t forget that registration for the October Live and Learn Unschooling  <br/>
Conference in St. Louis, MO is open.  Just go to <br/>
_<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.liveandlearnconference.org/registration.html_">http://www.liveandlearnconference.org/registration.html_</a> <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.liveandlearnconference.org/registration.html)">http://www.liveandlearnconference.org/registration.html)</a> <br/>
 <br/>
It is a wonderful conference full of Unschoolers from all over. Now is  your <br/>
chance to hear unschooling speakers, be with unschooling families and  just <br/>
immerse yourself in unschooling.<br/>
 <br/>
ALSO we are looking for unique vendors/exhibitors.  If you have a  product of <br/>
service you would like to put out there for other Unschoolers there  are <br/>
several ways you can participate:<br/>
1) Exhibit Booth at the Conference<br/>
2) Exhibitor  Facetime<br/>
3) Conference Handbook  Advertising<br/>
4) Brochure Bag<br/>
 <br/>
If you would like more information you can go here <br/>

(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.liveandlearnconference.org/exhibitors.html)">http://www.liveandlearnconference.org/exhibitors.html)</a>  for  all the details.<br/>
 <br/>
Think outside the box, think like Unschoolers...<br/>
If you have an idea or thought please e mail me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:_genant2@...">_genant2@...</a>_ <br/>
(mailto:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:genant2@...">genant2@...</a>)  and we will see if we can make  it happen.  If you have an <br/>
idea but are unsure if it will be profitable, e  mail me and we will talk and <br/>
see what we can come up with. <br/>
 <br/>
This conference is NOT like all other homeschooling conferences.   We DO NOT <br/>
want the usual curriculum vendors we want Unschoolers.  <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks,<br/>
And now back to your normal programming.<br/>

get there  LOL.  Try the main page.  <br/>

Cut and paste that or type it into your browser.  That should be the <br/>
home page for the conference.  The first tab on the left hand side is <br/>
the registration tab.  Maybe that will help you get there. Also there <br/>
is a tab for exhibitors.  <br/>

registration form isn&#39;t there yet (just checked again right before <br/>
posting this). I know Kelly&#39;s been up to her eyeballs trying to get <br/>
through all her backlog of stuff now that she has her new &#39;puter so I <br/>
was surprised to see a post that it was there already (happy but <br/>
surprised - registration is the only loose end to our trip, all the <br/>
rest of the reservations and plans are set) - I didn&#39;t figure it would <br/>
be all sorted out until next week at the earliest.</div>

The registration is NOT yet up. Still a few kinks and cool things to <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I wonder if anyone has any reassuring thoughts on why we should take<br/>
&gt; the plunge, despite concerns, and come to the conference?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Clarrisa, we went to our first unschooling conference when my kids were <br/>
6 and 2.<br/>
I knew no one in person, but recognized a few names from some of the <br/>
lists I had been<br/>
reading. My husband knew nothing except what I had told him. We aren&#39;t <br/>
the most social<br/>
people, my daughter (then 6) takes a looooong time to warm up to people <br/>
and there wasn&#39;t<br/>
that kind of time at the conference so she didn&#39;t really make any <br/>
friends or play at<br/>
all with anyone. But she watched, oh how she watched, and took it all <br/>
in! Even now 2<br/>
years later she will sometimes comment on something from that first <br/>
conference, such as<br/>
something she now has or is doing that she saw another child playing <br/>
with or doing at the<br/>
conference. It opened up so many people and ideas to her. The next time <br/>
we went<br/>
and she saw folks she had seen before, she was much more ready to talk <br/>
to them and be<br/>
drawn in. And now, after 3 conferences, she wouldn&#39;t let us stay home <br/>
if there was any way<br/>
at all she could change our minds (not that she&#39;d have to work too <br/>
hard!) - she loves it,<br/>
is so looking forward to seeing some of her special friends again, to <br/>
being opened to new<br/>
ideas and new things she will love exploring on her own afterwards, <br/>
seeing everyone&#39;s<br/>
talents at the talent show, walking around in a little bubble of <br/>
freedom roaming the hotel because we<br/>
are all there and it is a comfortable place for her to try out being <br/>
more social and independent.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of folks comment that their kids are too young to go to a <br/>
conference, they<br/>
think they should wait till they&#39;re older. But I would say it was <br/>
infinitely more important<br/>
for us as a family to go when the kids were younger - to give us a <br/>
blueprint for how we<br/>
could be with them, to unite my husband and I, to see how the <br/>
unschoolers look all grown up,<br/>
to find friends who understand us and will support us through some of <br/>
our doubtful days.<br/>
<br/>
Our first conference was where it &quot;clicked&quot; for Craig (dh), where he <br/>
really<br/>
understood what it was all about and started to actively rather than <br/>
passively live this life.<br/>
He met so many dads who connected with our cosleeping, extended <br/>
nursing, kids are people too,<br/>
reading will come as it comes, type philosophy (so different from his <br/>
usual interactions<br/>
at the office etc), he really felt supported and no longer on the <br/>
outside of something.<br/>
He saw the older kids and how confident and neat they all were, how <br/>
their uniqueness had<br/>
been celebrated, how they seemed so comfortable in their own skins <br/>
(more so even than<br/>
we did!) and he wanted that for his own kids.<br/>
<br/>
The experience brought us to a new place, it gave us confidence, it <br/>
gave us a<br/>
support network of folks, it put faces to the names we had been reading <br/>
on lists so now<br/>
the lists seemed more like chats amongst friends and no longer posts <br/>
from (possibly crazy)<br/>
strangers, it opened up worlds to our kids we could never have opened <br/>
ourselves<br/>
(our reserved dd performed on stage at the last conference!?), it <br/>
opened our eyes to<br/>
ways we had been holding back - that first conference literally changed <br/>
our lives. The<br/>
following ones have cemented the change, but the first one was <br/>
cataclysmic for us.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how it will be for your family, but we struggled with the <br/>
idea of<br/>
going to our first, the money, was it worth it, shouldn&#39;t we wait. We <br/>
didn&#39;t decide until 2<br/>
weeks before and then it was all a rush and a holler. I am *so* glad we <br/>
didn&#39;t let our<br/>
practical natures win out. It is scary to think where we would be now <br/>
as parents if we hadn&#39;t made<br/>
that leap and stretched ourselves to go into the wide open arms of a <br/>
hotel full of<br/>
strangers.<br/>
<br/>
If you have come so far as to post to this list wondering if you should <br/>
come, it<br/>
sounds like the idea, the philosophy, really appeals to you so I&#39;d say <br/>
do whatever it takes<br/>
to make it just this once. Despite the cost, it can&#39;t really hurt you <br/>
too much, and it<br/>
could very well change your lives completely. Coming once doesn&#39;t <br/>
commit you to ever coming<br/>
again. &lt;Asheville&gt; is worth a visit anyway for all its cool things to <br/>
do so you won&#39;t be<br/>
wasting your time even if you hate the conference (which you won&#39;t, but <br/>
just to reassure).<br/>
And you will meet people from all over the country (continent!) which <br/>
is like a social<br/>
studies field trip in itself.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;Plus, it&#39;s the LAST one.&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-613755638">I&#39;m wondering how this conference would be for our son, 10 years old. <br/>
We started hs-ing and unschooling last Fall, and are still <br/>

something besides being by himself with tv, and electronic games. He <br/>
still spends most of his time in that way. He has alwasy been slow to <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-299953173">Simon had a blast. He largely circled the Yugioh tables waiting and watching until he felt confident enough to join in the duels. He also hung out in the games room. Again, watching and waiting until he wanted to play too. There were other things going on. He had a blast playing with some boys down by the lake on the night of the bonfire. It was his kind of game, and imagined quest of sorts. He talked about that for a long time. Live and Learn was a great place for Simon to move slowly into interactions with others. The length of time, and the freedom to do it at his own pace, it is brilliant. <br/>

&gt; This conference is NOT like all other homeschooling conferences.   <br/>
We DO NOT <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-661204379">I&#39;m wondering how this conference would be for our son, 10 years old.<br/>
We started hs-ing and unschooling last Fall, and are still<br/>
deschooling to some extent. He is just beginning to be interested in<br/>
something besides being by himself with tv, and electronic games. He<br/>
still spends most of his time in that way. He has alwasy been slow to<br/>
warm up to a new crowd - real slow. So, though this conference sounds<br/>
great to me, what would it be like for him? What do 10-year old boys<br/>
do there?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well, there&#39;s NO TV, so that&#39;s right out. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But there&#39;s a gaming room. There&#39;s a YuGiOh! room.<br/>
<br/>
Duncan&#39;s 12 now. At ten, he spent almost the entire conference doing <br/>
those two things: gaming and YuGi. But he has a bunch of buddies (Andy <br/>
and Seamus and Simon and Alec and others)---many whom he only sees at <br/>
the conferences---and some new ones he meets each year for the first <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easier to make friends when they share the same passions. Their <br/>
language is similar---a foreign language to most adults! (Me, anyway!) <br/>
&lt;g&gt; But they simply aren&#39;t strangers for long. My guess is that, after <br/>
the first day, he&#39;ll have at least one child he&#39;s buds with---even <br/>
though he may not know his name. &lt;G&gt; But they&#39;ll find each other and <br/>
hang out together during meals, at the talent show, at the picnic.<br/>
<br/>
You might be surprised how quickly he connects with other kids here. <br/>
Mainly because no one&#39;s making him be somewhere or do something. He&#39;ll <br/>
get to choose where to go and what to do. And because we&#39;re all more <br/>
likely to connect with others who share what we love, we kind of have <br/>
&quot;instant&quot; friends at funshops &#39;cause we already know we have a shared <br/>
interest because we&#39;re AT that funshop.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-190739101">The Live and Learn Unschooling Conference---Early Bird Deadline is May <br/>
16th!<br/>
<br/>
Are you and your family considering unschooling?  Would you like to <br/>
learn more about how kids can learn without curriculum and see other <br/>
unschooling families in action?<br/>
<br/>
Have you and your family recently started unschooling and are excited <br/>
to explore this journey in more detail?<br/>
<br/>
Are you and your family experienced unschoolers interested in <br/>
connecting with other like-minded families?<br/>
<br/>
Then we hope you&#39;ll decide to join us! This is a wonderful opportunity <br/>
to spend time relaxing in a beautiful area of the country while <br/>
recharging your unschooling batteries, reconnecting with old friends, <br/>
meeting virtual friends, and being inspired as well as inspiring others!<br/>
<br/>
This will be the 7th and LAST Live and Learn Unschooling Conference, <br/>
September 3-7, 2008! It is a special FIVE day event at which <br/>
unschooling families convene to enjoy the Blue Ridge Mountains of North <br/>
Carolina and to experience an unschooling community first-hand. You <br/>
will be able to question and get ideas from experienced unschoolers. No <br/>
one will ask what curriculum you use, and you will be surrounded by <br/>
free families where children are trusted and respected.<br/>
<br/>
Bring the whole family (grandparents&#39; registration is FREE!); and enjoy <br/>
the many funshops, the gaming room, and the kids&#39; play room; <br/>
participate in the all-ages talent show; bask in the great outdoors; <br/>
hear wonderful talks given by experienced unschoolers; and participate <br/>
in the various round table sessions. There&#39;s something for everyone!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re thrilled to offer this joyful, life-affirming gathering of <br/>
unschooling families at the YMCA Blue Ridge Assembly, a full-service <br/>
conference center situated on 1200 acres of woodland beautified by <br/>
mountain streams, wildflowers, ridges, valleys, and spectacular views <br/>
in the middle of the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina.<br/>
<br/>
Things will kick off Wednesday with registration at 10:00am. Wednesday <br/>
after lunch, we will have outdoor challenge courses available for the <br/>
outdoorsy types as well as the BRA&#39;s Art Center for the crafters. There <br/>
will be a Carnival up on the lawn at Lee Hall, with all sorts of fun <br/>
things do to for &quot;kids&quot; of all ages! After supper, we will be serenaded <br/>
by none other than AMY STEINBERG, who knows that she is &quot;Exactly Where <br/>
She Needs To Be&quot;!<br/>
<br/>
Thursday through Sunday we will have presentations from a wide range of <br/>
speakers, all radical unschoolers:<br/>
<br/>
James Coburn, the fun-loving, passionate, die-hard unschooling DAD of <br/>
Jayn will share his views on whole Life Unschooling from a father&#39;s <br/>
perspective.<br/>
<br/>
Beth Fuller will share her journey of applying unschooling and mindful <br/>
parenting practices to her relationship with her husband, Kevin as she <br/>
talks about Peaceful Partnerships.<br/>
<br/>
Cameron Lovejoy and Brenna McBroom are unschooled young adults (and <br/>
good friends) who are now venturing out in very opposite directions. <br/>
Listen to their experiences and where they&#39;re heading.<br/>
<br/>
Ronnie Meier, better known as &quot;dragonfly&quot; to old unschooling.com and <br/>
now unshcooling.info readers, is the mom of teens and will share her <br/>
take on parenting and unschooling teens.<br/>
<br/>
Scott Noelle is a father of two and the author and publisher of the <br/>
popular _The Daily Groove_, an online daily inspirational message <br/>
designed to help parents internalize the new paradigm of creative <br/>
partnership with children.<br/>
<br/>
Anne Ohman will again be joining us. Anne&#39;s gentle, joyful, and <br/>
inspirational message of &quot;All Children SHINE with Unschooling&quot; is <br/>
voiced daily on her SHINEwithUnschooling yahoogroup.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, we will have SSUDs (Secret Society of Unschooling Dads), the <br/>
every-popular Talents Shows, Fairy Godparents, an Untrepreneurial Fair, <br/>
the Raffle and Silent Auction, and Closing Picnic. This year, we&#39;re <br/>
excited to have a Masquerade Ball Saturday Night---so don&#39;t forget your <br/>
costumes!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So… whether your family has been unschooling for years, or is just <br/>
getting started, the Live and Learn Unschooling Conference will allow <br/>
you to connect with other unschoolers from around the country and be a <br/>
part of a community that values real learning, joy, and laughter. Come <br/>
away with friends, ideas, and community!<br/>
