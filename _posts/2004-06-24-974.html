<div id="ygrps-yiv-659829220">Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
On my journey to discover the depths of unschooling, I heard lots about bedtimes, food and choices. And now I wonder about this... what do you do about the job of brushing teeth? Do your children decide for themselves if they are going to brush their teeth now, ever, at all? How do you handle this? If they don&#39;t and end up with cavities, do they pay for their own dental work? or do you?<br/>
<br/>
I have a 4 year old, who rarely lets me brush her teeth, I have refused to get into a physical battle over teeth brushing in the evenings so have let her do her own.. she does a crappy job... chomps on the brush and very rarely lets me brush them for her. I tried all the fun games and for awhile the Winnie the Pooh characters lived in her mouth and had to be brushed out, this worked but didn&#39;t last for ever. So I know these are baby teeth and we wouldn&#39;t do any dental work unless it was causing her pain, she is completely horrified at the idea of seeing a dentist. So I try to explain to her the importance of brushing... I brush mine at the same time as her as well... and she responds... she just won&#39;t get any cavities (logic of a 4 year for you) so in an unschooling philosophy would you just leave it at that or would you (seeing as you know she will get cavities) be more forceful.<br/>
<br/>
Please notice I said *more* forceful. I am not going to get in the situation where one parent is holding her down and the other brushes her teeth even with her screaming etc... like some parents I know do... but how would you experienced unschoolers handle this?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well kids don&#39;t want cavities regardless of their actions. They want us to<br/>
help them be safe and healthy. But they don&#39;t want us to tie them down and<br/>
make them do what we think they should either.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always brushed my teeth with my daughter. It&#39;s a social time. I<br/>
remember as a child the 3 minutes it took feeling like 30.<br/>
<br/>
You can try no toothpaste. The brushing is more important than the paste.<br/>
<br/>
You can let it go for a while and just give them information so they can<br/>
make better decisions. Tell them what brushing does. Get a kids book on it.<br/>
<br/>
And then invite them to brush with you. You can let them know you&#39;re<br/>
concerned that if they aren&#39;t in the habit of brushing regularly that they<br/>
could get cavities. But don&#39;t say it in a shaming way that tells them<br/>
they&#39;re making the wrong decision, that you can&#39;t wait until they wise up<br/>
and make the right decision. It&#39;s information. It&#39;s sharing your concern.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1001043547">I once witnessed a non-unschooler telling her little girl that there were  <br/>
sugar bugs on her teeth and that they had to be brushed off.  That little  girl <br/>
must have brushed for 4 or 5 mins before her mom convinced her that she had  <br/>
them all off!  <br/>
    Have you found a dentist for her yet?  We have one  that is WONDERFUL!  <br/>
My 6ds loves to go, get cleanings, and he did have work  done, which was almost <br/>
a mistake, because he enjoyed it so much he isn&#39;t too  worried about more <br/>
cavities. (backfire!)<br/>
  But our dentist advertises as using gentle dentistry and it made a  world <br/>
of difference between them going now and what I had to go thru as a  kid.  <br/>
  What about the battery operated brush&#39;s?  <br/>
My oldest was rushing thru brushing his teeth, and after looking at them in  <br/>
the daylight and seeing whta was on there, (ok, now this is gross) I scraped  <br/>
alittle off with my finger nail (yes, he said go ahead) and he saw what was on <br/>
 his teeth.  He now does a much better job.  But he&#39;s 11 now and I know  <br/>
there&#39;s a world of difference in how they take care of things at different  ages!<br/>
good luck<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1661591703">My son is 4 and a half and about 6 months ago I explained to him how <br/>
cavities were formed, in full scientific detail.  Since then he has <br/>
been very good about brushing.  He is also really into microbes and <br/>
really understood what I was explaining to him.  There has to be some <br/>
kids book that explains how cavities are formed?  <br/>
<br/>
If she won&#39;t let you brush, will she let you rub a cloth over her <br/>
teeth?  I know this was discussed, I think at unschooling.com message <br/>
boards.  Someone said as long as you disrupt the bacteria once a day <br/>
that is usually sufficient to avoid cavities.  She can also try <br/>
eating certain foods at night, I think carrots are good at helping <br/>
get the bacteria off.  I can&#39;t remember all the suggestions, but you <br/>
can try searching the archives at unschooling.com.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-890982044">Hi Pam....<br/>
<br/>
Well as a Scorpio/Cat I ask a lot of questions and am often (most of the time?) conflicted.<br/>
<br/>
So I just sort of thought, for me, that the bedtime thing was starting to be less productive as peoples personal belief were becoming more and more challenged that doesn&#39;t mean another hot topic isn&#39;t interesting.<br/>
<br/>
And it is personal to me right now.... as I said... and I am really thinking about how to handle it so thought I would ask because it is something I haven&#39;t seen mentioned. I mean when you say &quot;unschooling&quot; food and bedtimes are almost automatically included, but there are several other things that might give some of us new people a bit more insight instead of running around the same bush over and over, if that makes sense?<br/>
<br/>
So I am inclined to honour her wishes and just let it be.... she does willingly rinse with ozonated water each evening, so I know that the bad bacteria that cause cavities are being eliminated on the surface at least. BUT if she needs to go to the dentist, I know how much of a traumatic event this will be for her, from history and it is an additional expense that my dh and I will have to absorb. So the inclination is, unless you can pay for the dental work yourself you will brush your teeth as I say.. however I hate that. But when we are working out strategies for these things, isn&#39;t things like consequences (financial in this case) as well as future emotional trauma to be considered? And when she say &quot;oh I won&#39;t get one mama&quot; like she can will it to not happen, how do you honour that and let it going knowing what the probability is? <br/>
<br/>
SO there you go.... have fun and be gentle with me:)<br/>

year for you) so in an unschooling philosophy would you just leave it at<br/>
that or would you (seeing as you know she will get cavities) be more<br/>
forceful.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Jayn (4.5) almost never brushes her teeth. When she does, she uses only<br/>
water - I think trying toothpaste early is one of things that discouraged<br/>
her. Sometimes she brushes mine and then I brush hers, a game we enjoy -<br/>
she&#39;s really gentle. She brushes her teeth herself most times, and then I<br/>
give them an extra go. Jayn has one cavity in the first molar, which she<br/>
seems quite interested in. Her teeth came in very late (none til 12 months)<br/>
and I think she has been fortunate to inherit her father&#39;s strong teeth,<br/>
instead of my cavity prone ones. All the brushing in the world when I was<br/>
young and I still ended up with four rows of silver. Also she is still<br/>
nursing.<br/>
<br/>
I invite her to brush her teeth whenever I do (which is usually twice a<br/>
day). I have talked about cavities in an honest way - &quot;if you don&#39;t brush<br/>
your teeth they look yellow, and you *might* get more cavities&quot;. I have<br/>
talked about how they will all come out and she will get new permanent ones<br/>
that she might want to brush more. She seems to like to floss when she sees<br/>
me doing so, although of course with her milk teeth there is a lot of space<br/>
between them. We have looked at photos of bad teeth online and talked about<br/>
gum disease. She seems fascinated but doesn&#39;t see how that applies to her I<br/>
guess.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure that inviting is helpful for Jayn, now that I think/write about<br/>
it, because most of the times that she does brush her teeth, she has out of<br/>
the blue said, &quot;I&#39;m going to brush my teeth&quot; or called me to the bathroom<br/>
with &quot;Are my teeth white and shiny?&quot; before I knew she had gone in there.<br/>
<br/>
Other children sometimes tell Jayn about their dental experiences, showing<br/>
her their horrible metal fillings. (I won&#39;t be allowing amalgam fillings,<br/>
even if I must pay more.) One child deliberately started trying to terrify<br/>
her, talking about how the dentist puts you into a big chair in the dark,<br/>
and your mommy can&#39;t be with you, and you scream. I immediately said, &quot;That<br/>
is not the kind of dentist Jayn will go to&quot;. I don&#39;t understand these<br/>
mothers who take their child to a dentist who then takes the kid away while<br/>
the mother chit chats in the waiting room - with a RULE that mother may NOT<br/>
come to the examining room with their child - even the first time. But I<br/>
don&#39;t entrust Jayn to strangers under any circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
My point is that I think that Jayn will come around to brushing her teeth<br/>
regularly - at least as regularly as Daddy, which is once per day in the<br/>
shower. I&#39;m really hoping that the one with the cavity holds on until her<br/>
teeth come out naturally, but if she starts getting an ache, or expresses a<br/>
desire to go when I ask her, I will take her to a kindly dentist who will<br/>
move slowly and accept Jayn&#39;s need to take things at her own pace, even if I<br/>
have to pay for more of that person&#39;s time than usual.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn&#39;s intention, BTW, with her lost teeth is to give them to her baby dolls<br/>
to keep for her. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-665747898">My daughter is fourteen and she thinks it is my job to force her to brush<br/>
her teeth.  I have told her that I will remind her, but she needs to make<br/>
herself do it.  She has requested that I brush my teeth with her, which I am<br/>
happy to do.  Looking back, I would have felt better if I had brushed my<br/>
teeth with her from the very beginning.  My feeling is that if that is what<br/>
you are doing, you are doing your best.  My daughter wanted us to brush her<br/>
teeth (at age 5), but we said she had to learn to do it herself.  This was<br/>
foolish of me, I should have brushed them as long as she wanted me to help<br/>
her.  Maybe you could just offer each night to brush her teeth and if she<br/>
declines, at least you tried.  You could make it a game of some sort.  There<br/>
are so many choices of tooth brushes and toothpaste, maybe you could<br/>
motivate her that way.  One positive parenting book suggests that you say<br/>
&quot;if you brush your teeth right away, I will have time to read three books to<br/>
you instead of just one&quot;.  My daughter lost a baby tooth to decay and I do<br/>
not think the consequence of that really had any effect on her whatsoever.<br/>
It was quite painful, and expensive.  She also had several fillings on her<br/>
baby teeth.  However, I know some children that have lots of cavity&#39;s<br/>
despite the fact that they brush and floss each day.  Our dentist said that<br/>
baby teeth are sometimes prone to decay, but are not an indication of what<br/>
the child&#39;s adult teeth will be like.  In addition, a child&#39;s diet has a lot<br/>
to do with cavity protection.  Any sugars that stick to the teeth usually do<br/>
damage within 20 minutes and no one brushes that often.  My son never had<br/>
cavities and now has one on his last baby tooth.  Unfortunately it may be<br/>
damaging an adult tooth that is next to it.  We will not know until it falls<br/>
out.  He is good at brushing his teeth, but this was an issue of not<br/>
flossing and sucking cough drops at night due to allergies.  So, there are<br/>
many factors involved and you just have to do your best.  When I was a child<br/>
they had us chew red tablets to show where we were not brushing very well.<br/>
It motivated me for a couple of days.  Sometimes I open my mouth to show my<br/>
children my own fillings.  This works as motivation some of the time.</div>

<br/>
Not sure the &quot;bug&quot; thing would work right now. I have heard of this idea before suggested and liked it... but dd is having a really hard time with the idea of bugs right now, so might have to think of some other thing to make it... that might work... will see.<br/>
<br/>
At this time we have no dentist for her to see..... and am not overly concerned with regular check ups either...<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for the post.<br/>

Dd tried toothpaste once because she asked too... didn&#39;t like it hasn&#39;t used<br/>
it again since. So it is a water and brush event. Tried letting her brush<br/>
mine, but she just is too rough and gagged me half the time.<br/>
<br/>
I will try to share more info about what might happen to her teeth if she<br/>
doesn&#39;t take better care of them... but I think like yours... really does<br/>
see it as hers.. she says..&quot;oh don&#39;t worry mommy I won&#39;t get any cavities&quot;<br/>
as if she can will it to be that way:)<br/>

&gt; it, because most of the times that she does brush her teeth, she has out<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; the blue said, &quot;I&#39;m going to brush my teeth&quot; or called me to the bathroom<br/>
&gt; with &quot;Are my teeth white and shiny?&quot; before I knew she had gone in there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Other children sometimes tell Jayn about their dental experiences, showing<br/>
&gt; her their horrible metal fillings. (I won&#39;t be allowing amalgam fillings,<br/>
&gt; even if I must pay more.) One child deliberately started trying to terrify<br/>
&gt; her, talking about how the dentist puts you into a big chair in the dark,<br/>
&gt; and your mommy can&#39;t be with you, and you scream. I immediately said,<br/>
&quot;That<br/>
&gt; is not the kind of dentist Jayn will go to&quot;. I don&#39;t understand these<br/>
&gt; mothers who take their child to a dentist who then takes the kid away<br/>
while<br/>
&gt; the mother chit chats in the waiting room - with a RULE that mother may<br/>
NOT<br/>
&gt; come to the examining room with their child - even the first time. But I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t entrust Jayn to strangers under any circumstances.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My point is that I think that Jayn will come around to brushing her teeth<br/>
&gt; regularly - at least as regularly as Daddy, which is once per day in the<br/>
&gt; shower. I&#39;m really hoping that the one with the cavity holds on until her<br/>
&gt; teeth come out naturally, but if she starts getting an ache, or expresses<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; desire to go when I ask her, I will take her to a kindly dentist who will<br/>
&gt; move slowly and accept Jayn&#39;s need to take things at her own pace, even if<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; have to pay for more of that person&#39;s time than usual.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Jayn&#39;s intention, BTW, with her lost teeth is to give them to her baby<br/>
dolls<br/>
&gt; to keep for her.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1106024731">WOW Betsy, <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the other perspective. And something I hope I don&#39;t get to.<br/>
<br/>
I also believe that baby teeth have no indication of what the adult teeth will be like as long as I remember.<br/>
I guess I am just worried, (oh listen to this) that if she doesn&#39;t learn a good habit of doing it now she will never get it... sigh.. of course that is silly...<br/>
<br/>
More trust in the world and nature huh?<br/>

  Subject: RE: [unschoolingbasics] brushing teeth<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  My daughter is fourteen and she thinks it is my job to force her to brush<br/>
  her teeth.  I have told her that I will remind her, but she needs to make<br/>
  herself do it.  She has requested that I brush my teeth with her, which I am<br/>
  happy to do.  Looking back, I would have felt better if I had brushed my<br/>
  teeth with her from the very beginning.  My feeling is that if that is what<br/>
  you are doing, you are doing your best.  My daughter wanted us to brush her<br/>
  teeth (at age 5), but we said she had to learn to do it herself.  This was<br/>
  foolish of me, I should have brushed them as long as she wanted me to help<br/>
  her.  Maybe you could just offer each night to brush her teeth and if she<br/>
  declines, at least you tried.  You could make it a game of some sort.  There<br/>
  are so many choices of tooth brushes and toothpaste, maybe you could<br/>
  motivate her that way.  One positive parenting book suggests that you say<br/>
  &quot;if you brush your teeth right away, I will have time to read three books to<br/>
  you instead of just one&quot;.  My daughter lost a baby tooth to decay and I do<br/>
  not think the consequence of that really had any effect on her whatsoever.<br/>
  It was quite painful, and expensive.  She also had several fillings on her<br/>
  baby teeth.  However, I know some children that have lots of cavity&#39;s<br/>
  despite the fact that they brush and floss each day.  Our dentist said that<br/>
  baby teeth are sometimes prone to decay, but are not an indication of what<br/>
  the child&#39;s adult teeth will be like.  In addition, a child&#39;s diet has a lot<br/>
  to do with cavity protection.  Any sugars that stick to the teeth usually do<br/>
  damage within 20 minutes and no one brushes that often.  My son never had<br/>
  cavities and now has one on his last baby tooth.  Unfortunately it may be<br/>
  damaging an adult tooth that is next to it.  We will not know until it falls<br/>
  out.  He is good at brushing his teeth, but this was an issue of not<br/>
  flossing and sucking cough drops at night due to allergies.  So, there are<br/>
  many factors involved and you just have to do your best.  When I was a child<br/>
  they had us chew red tablets to show where we were not brushing very well.<br/>
  It motivated me for a couple of days.  Sometimes I open my mouth to show my<br/>
  children my own fillings.  This works as motivation some of the time.<br/>

<br/>
I will check at unschooling.com and see what I can see.<br/>
<br/>
Given what you say I am reassured then. She chews the heck out a toothbrush every night... buy about one a month.. and she rinses with ozonated water. I see some small black spots on teeth but not much I can do about that now.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>

  My son is 4 and a half and about 6 months ago I explained to him how <br/>
  cavities were formed, in full scientific detail.  Since then he has <br/>
  been very good about brushing.  He is also really into microbes and <br/>
  really understood what I was explaining to him.  There has to be some <br/>
  kids book that explains how cavities are formed?  <br/>
<br/>
  If she won&#39;t let you brush, will she let you rub a cloth over her <br/>
  teeth?  I know this was discussed, I think at unschooling.com message <br/>
  boards.  Someone said as long as you disrupt the bacteria once a day <br/>
  that is usually sufficient to avoid cavities.  She can also try <br/>
  eating certain foods at night, I think carrots are good at helping <br/>
  get the bacteria off.  I can&#39;t remember all the suggestions, but you <br/>
  can try searching the archives at unschooling.com.<br/>

my then 5yo ds just had a tooth that had gone really bad all of a sudden (so it<br/>
seemed) and was causing him a lot of pain.  I found a children&#39;s dentist as<br/>
quickly as I could.  The tooth had to be pulled out but they wouldn&#39;t let me go<br/>
back with him.  In hindsight I could kick myself for not putting up a fight,<br/>
but at the time I just wanted him treated as quickly as possible and I didn&#39;t<br/>
know where else to go.  But we VERY quickly found someone who could recommend a<br/>
good dentist and changed.  But even there with a GREAT dentist who always let<br/>
us be with him he usually freaked out when we had to go.  No doubt because of<br/>
the initial visit.  GRRRR.  I get mad everytime I think about it, I&#39;m not sure<br/>
who I get more mad at him or myself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-647317625">So...it&#39;s been a very long time since I&#39;ve posted anything here.  And it&#39;s<br/>
funny, after years of this it always comes back to &#39;basics&#39; because each<br/>
child is different.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Khidar (5) is the youngest person in a house of seven ppl.  As such, he has<br/>
had to learn to assert himself and make sure that he is heard.  He&#39;s<br/>
very..ummmm...fiery and is always clear on how he is feeling - especially<br/>
when he feels &#39;put-upon&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Khidar absolutely refuses to brush his teeth.  We&#39;ve gone to the dentist and<br/>
he&#39;s has a few cavities.  He does have bleeding gums whenever he does decide<br/>
to brush them, and I am concerned about his dental health.  I have tried to<br/>
steer clear of forcing him to brush his teeth, but I&#39;ll admit my fears have<br/>
gotten the best of me on more than one occasion.  And I have asked him why<br/>
he doesn&#39;t want to brush his teeth.  His response: &quot;so that my teeth will<br/>
fall out and my grown up teeth will come in&quot;.  I asked him what that means<br/>
to him.  His response &quot;then I&#39;ll be a grown up and I&#39;ll be a daddy&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking that he associates his baby teeth with being a baby, and thus<br/>
weak, small, and powerless.  And he wants those teeth to fall out so that he<br/>
can have the grown up teeth and be powerful and big, which he clearly<br/>
believes his dad to be J  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So should I just let this be a mute point?  What do I do as his &#39;grown up&#39;<br/>
teeth come in? (two already have).  What can I do to help him be okay with<br/>
being a child?  Most importantly: What I can I do to help ME be okay with<br/>
him not wanting to brush his teeth?  <br/>

Thank you Joyce!<br/>

After realizing why Khidar didn&#39;t want to brush his teeth (wanting baby<br/>
teeth to fall out so big teeth could grow in and he could be powerful), I<br/>
understood much better.  Then his dad and I were in the kitchen with him<br/>
this evening and his dad told him that even if he brushed his teeth the baby<br/>
teeth would still fall out and the grown up teeth would still grow in.<br/>
Since this information came from the person he&#39;s wanting to emulate, it<br/>
seemed to give Khidar some solace.  I asked him tonight if he wanted to<br/>
brush his teeth with me and he said yes.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
And if he doesn&#39;t want to do it tomorrow night..I won&#39;t freak out J  He<br/>
loves apples so he can just eat as many of those as he likes instead of<br/>
brushing his teeth.<br/>

Thanks Joyce. Right before opening this e-mail I was thinking hrmm Ive been semi-lurking here for a while and maybe we should start a file or something because this one comes up every few months. :) <br/>
<br/>
If I can add one more I didn&#39;t see..<br/>
Some kids are very sensitive and just can&#39;t stand the feel of the toothbrush. Another was is suggesting that they shine their teeth by wrapping a washrag on your (or their) finer and gently rubbing the teeth and gum line. <br/>

Have you mentioned that the grown up teeth will come in in their own good time (just like we all get older in our own good time) or that if the baby teeth fall out early from decay that it won&#39;t make the adult teeth come in any faster, they still will come in only when they are ready?  Maybe explain that it helps the whole mouth and body to take care of your teeth and that one way to make a good environment for those new teeth is to start right now by taking care of the baby teeth.  <br/>
<br/>
Would he be into using a water pic or brusing with sea salt that he could crush up in a mortar and pestal and then dip his toothbrush into that.  Those were two suggestions to prevent cavities (because we don&#39;t use flouride) that my holistic dentist recommended in addition to brushing and flossing.  I mentioned them because it might be something different that helps and he might like to do.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe find a new way to call &quot;baby teeth&quot; if he is sensitive to himself being thought of as a baby and wanting to be grown up like Daddy..maybe use &quot;first teeth&quot; &quot;initial teeth&quot; ... or even use &quot;second set of teeth&quot; instead of adult teeth if you think that would deemphasize the whole reference to age.<br/>
<br/>
Also, can he brush with Daddy?  Often my son waits to brush so he can brush with Daddy.  <br/>
