It  hurts! But the pain is temporary and the tattoo is forever so it&#39;s worth<br/>
it  if it&#39;s important to you. I didn&#39;t have swelling afterwards but  itching<br/>
when it was healing. You shouldn&#39;t scratch but smacking it helps a  lot. DO<br/>
NOT use NEOSPORIN on it!!!!! I did cuz I ran out if the stuff they  gave me<br/>
and I had to get it redone! Neosporin heals it from the inside out  and<br/>
pushes out the ink. Use Bacitracin (sp?) only. After care is pretty  simple<br/>
and a good tattoo shop will inform you of all aftercare in writing  and give<br/>
you the stuff you will  need.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I thought is was OK, felt like a scratch over and over again.  Not  bad.  I <br/>
used neosporin after, per the written instructions the tattooist  gave me.  And <br/>
mine healed fine and looks great.  I didn&#39;t think it  hurt much afterward.<br/>
Just my experience.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-823196796">&quot;Okay tattoo-ed folks, I need your real life input -<br/>
just exactly what kind of pain is involved either<br/>
during or afterward? I&#39;m a coward about needles in<br/>
general (I can just about manage to get blood drawn<br/>
each year to check some medical stuff but that takes<br/>
lots of relaxing breathing just to get the needle in<br/>
and there&#39;s no permanent marks or anything left).&quot;<br/>
Mine wasn&#39;t painful at all. I did have to have the<br/>
artist stop a lot. My tattoo is located on my right<br/>
thigh, right in the middle, on the side. I needed him<br/>
to stop because I had huge giggle fits. However, the<br/>
tiny, I think she weighted (I&#39;m a big girl) 100&#39;s lbs<br/>
soaking weight, 18 yo girl came in and got a tattoo in<br/>
the same spot and she was in pain. I felt bad for her.<br/>
Especailly as I was laughing during mine. I don&#39;t know<br/>
why it tickled when he went over the back of my thigh.<br/>
I guess I&#39;m just weird. <br/>
&quot;So, swelling afterward? irritation? pain (mild to<br/>
severe)? etc. What kind of afterward-care is needed?<br/>
(like with piercings that need certain types of<br/>
cleansing and such when they&#39;re fresh)&quot;<br/>
After 6 years, mine still swells sometimes. So, does<br/>
my husbands. We just used lotion, although I used<br/>
bagbalm too. I would say that between tattoos and<br/>
piercings, I can&#39;t really say which one I liked more.<br/>
I didn&#39;t think any hurt. But then again, I must be<br/>
wired differently. I hope this helps. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If we took a holiday... Took some time to celebrate... Just one day out of life... It would be so nice...<br/>
