<div id="ygrps-yiv-491403851">I guess I got so wrapped up remembering those times I forgot to ask <br/>
my question.  So here we go.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading sstuff about mindful parenting and have never been <br/>
a spanker.  But recently my 3.5 year old has become a real <br/>
challange.  If something doesn&#39;t happen the way he wants it to he has <br/>
full blown tantrums.  Now I have seen this in other children, but <br/>
never in mine.  And do try to let him do the things he wants to do, <br/>
but here is an example of a time when he just can&#39;t do what he <br/>
wants.  <br/>
<br/>
Last night Joel spent some time with my mom and my nephew who is also <br/>
3.5.  On the way to pick him up I bought milk and some other <br/>
groceries that needed to get in the fridge before they spoiled.  When <br/>
I took him to the car he told me that he wanted to sit on my lap.  I <br/>
explained that he needed to be in his carseat in order to be safe and <br/>
so that we wouldn&#39;t get a ticket from the policeman.  He told me to <br/>
put the carseat in the driver&#39;s seat.  Well, I tried to tell him that <br/>
that wouldn&#39;t work as I put him in his deat in the back.  He started <br/>
to sruggle and fight.  He stiffened his body out straight so that I <br/>
couldn&#39;t put the straps on him, but I managed to get him in and <br/>
everything fastened.  Then he started screaming at me *Mom, shut up. <br/>
Mom, shut up.*  Over and over again he screamed, with my bewildered <br/>
parents watching from the driveway.  I ignored him and backed out of <br/>
the driveway with him screaming the whole way.  About five minutes <br/>
into the drive he told me that I wasn&#39;t his Mom anymore.  At that <br/>
point my head was pounding.  I pulled the car over, got out, opened <br/>
his door and got very close to his face.  I told him that he could <br/>
not continue to talk to me that way, that he hurt my feelings, and <br/>
then I did a bad thing.  I told him that I was taking his brother to <br/>
McDonalds and that I didn&#39;t want to buy anything for him.  That <br/>
seemed to get his attention, he wanted something, too.  Now I never <br/>
intended to leave him out, but I told him that when he hurt my <br/>
feelings like that it made me not want to buy him something.  Please <br/>
understand that he had already eaten dinner at my Mom&#39;s, I would <br/>
never withhold food as a punishment.  But at least he stopped <br/>
screaming.  I got back in the driver&#39;s seat and we had a discussion <br/>
about not telling each other to shut up because it is a mean thing to <br/>
say.  My eleven year old was involved in this and told me that he <br/>
understood now why I didn&#39;t like it when he said this to his little <br/>
brother.  He even apoligized to Little bro for having said it to him <br/>
in the past and made a pact to stop.  <br/>
<br/>
This was one outburst of anger, but they happen several times a day.  <br/>
They usually consist of Joel growling and saying, *I&#39;m so ANGRY with <br/>
you* over and over again.  And while I&#39;m glad he can put his feelings <br/>
into words, it still feels violent.  How should I handle these <br/>
outbursts of anger.  This is a new thing for him in the last couple <br/>
of months. Is this just a stage?  Any help or advice will be <br/>
appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-455433400">***When I took him to the car he told me that he wanted to sit on my<br/>
lap.***<br/>
<br/>
You made groceries more important than your baby.  That sounds harsh but<br/>
I hope you can think about this in a new way.<br/>
<br/>
He needed you.  For some reason he needed to sit on your lap and be close<br/>
to you.  Maybe he had a hard time at your moms.  Maybe he was longing for<br/>
you.  Maybe he needed some close time to transition from the activity at<br/>
your mom&#39;s house to  going home.  He needed you and you decided milk was<br/>
more important than what he needed. <br/>
<br/>
What if you&#39;d held him?  What if he was happy after ten minutes.  The<br/>
milk would have been ok.  What if he wanted you to hold him for forty<br/>
minutes?   The milk might have still been ok, but what if it wasn&#39;t?<br/>
<br/>
What if you had to go by more milk?  The price of milk is not greater<br/>
than your sons comfort and happiness. <br/>
Surely you&#39;ve &quot;wasted&quot; a few dollars on something that would brighten<br/>
your day, a new lipstick or nail polish or something.  Your son needed a<br/>
moment of brightness with you. <br/>
<br/>
If your other son was with you maybe he could have run the perishables in<br/>
to your moms fridge until you were ready to go.  <br/>
<br/>
***I told him that when he hurt my feelings like that it made me not want<br/>
to buy him something. ***<br/>
<br/>
And when you hurt his feelings by not being available to him he didn&#39;t<br/>
know what to do.  He reacted like a three year old who didn&#39;t really know<br/>
how to tell his mom he needed some closeness and comfort. <br/>
<br/>
***How should I handle these outbursts of anger.  This is a new thing for<br/>
him in the last couple <br/>
of months.***<br/>
<br/>
Try to be as understanding as you can.  Try to think about what led to<br/>
him feeling so angry and frustrated.  We all get angry and almost no one<br/>
gets angry for no reason.  See if you can identify the things that lead<br/>
to his frustration and head them off.  Listen to him.  He&#39;s trying so<br/>
hard to communicate with you!  He&#39;s only had a few years on this planet,<br/>
speaking this language and trying to understand how things work.  He<br/>
needs your help when things aren&#39;t going right.  <br/>
<br/>
It is hard to be little and to want to do things a little body or little<br/>
hands just aren&#39;t able to do yet.  It&#39;s hard to not be able to express<br/>
yourself in terms other people clearly understand and respect.   <br/>
<br/>
Maybe he&#39;s tired and needs some quiet time in the rocking chair with you.<br/>
 Maybe he&#39;s out of energy and needs a snack.  He might not recognize the<br/>
symptoms of those things and so, can&#39;t express that to you.  <br/>
Maybe he wants some sympathy when things are going wrong. <br/>
<br/>
Cheryl, it&#39;s hard being a mom and especially a mom who&#39;s trying so hard<br/>
to get everything right.  If you can remember he isn&#39;t trying to hurt<br/>
your feelings or make your life harder, he&#39;s just trying to communicate<br/>
some need or problem he has and he doesn&#39;t have all the skills to do that<br/>
yet.  If you can think about that it will help you be more patient with<br/>
him.  He wants to be happy and he wants you to be happy with him.  Our<br/>
society portrays kids as working against their parents and it just isn&#39;t<br/>
so.  I think in so many ways parents are conditioned to think of their<br/>
kids as adversaries.  You don&#39;t have to.  You can think of him as someone<br/>
who loves you and needs you alot right now.  Someone who wants to be<br/>
happy and feel good about himself and his mom.  If you think of the<br/>
situation as both of you having the same goal you can work with him to<br/>
find solutions instead of feeling like your working against him.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1430136790">Welcome, Cheryl,<br/>
<br/>
I wish I had more time the next few days to respond to your post in more<br/>
detail - hopefully others will.  However, I want to write you quickly to say<br/>
I have a three and a half yr old son of my own going through the same stage<br/>
(and a daughter who is a veteran of it).  It is a very normal developmental<br/>
stage and also a really challenging time!  What has made all the difference<br/>
to me is a book I cannot even begin to recommend highly enough &quot;The<br/>
Discipline Book&quot; by Dr. William Sears & Martha Sears.  My copy is dog eared<br/>
because when I find myself stumped or frustrated and I need a way back to<br/>
positive discipline that works and makes both of us feel good, I go read it<br/>
or the relavant parts of it again.  It discusses why they feel spanking<br/>
doesn&#39;t work (as parents who used to spank) and lots of alternatives...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1579360756">Thanks for the change in perspective.  I think that&#39;s is exactly what  I <br/>
need.  A change in perspective.  He was definitly tired.  And  it&#39;s hard to handle <br/>
those situations, but it was even harder with my own parents  watching, who <br/>
are now raising my nephew by the way.  I find it hard to  explain my new <br/>
parenting philosophy to them.  I just don&#39;t know where to  start.  Whenever I try I <br/>
get the feeling they think I&#39;m *spoiling* my  sons.  I gave them a copy of The <br/>
Natural Child by Jan Hunt and the lost  it:(  I need to buy another copy so I <br/>
can read it again.<br/>

<br/>
Ugh. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never been a perfectionist but when my son was born I wanted so much<br/>
to do everything perfectly.  When someone even looked like they were<br/>
about to criticize my mothering I was devastated.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know why it mattered what anyone else thought.  The only person<br/>
my mothering needed to impress was my son!&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
***He told me  he  wanted to DRIVE. ***<br/>
<br/>
OH! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if there&#39;s some out of the way place you can go and let him sit<br/>
on your lap and steer?  A dark parking lot at midnight? &lt;g&gt;  Maybe check<br/>
what the fine is for unrestrained, speeding toddlers first, to see if you<br/>
could pay it.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Dylan used to sit on his dad&#39;s lap and steer the truck if we had to go to<br/>
the dump, or sometimes on the way to a picnic.  Now, I know there are<br/>
moms right now gasping at the irresponsibility, never mind the safety<br/>
issues, but it seemed less dangerous than strapping him into a car going<br/>
(at that time no speed limit in Montana) eighty miles an hour on an<br/>
Interstate with other cars going that fast or faster. <br/>
I&#39;ve recently taken Dylan out on the back roads to let him drive.  He&#39;s<br/>
twelve now.  He can&#39;t legally drive in Montana until he&#39;s fifteen.  <br/>
<br/>
***easier to smile about it today.  I want to be able to  smile about it<br/>
when it happens. ***<br/>
<br/>
If we only knew in the heat of the moment what we know when it&#39;s all<br/>
over.  You will smile about it.  He won&#39;t always be three and you won&#39;t<br/>
always be in the middle of an emerging new parenting philosophy and you<br/>
won&#39;t always care what your folks think.  It all gets easier.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-180084446">Cheryl, here is a simple formula that works for almost anything - even with small children. <br/>
 <br/>
Observation <br/>
 <br/>
Feelings<br/>
 <br/>
Needs<br/>
 <br/>
Request<br/>
 <br/>
When I am yelled at, I feel sad/angry/frustrated. I need a quiet voice when I am spoken to. Would you be willing to use a quiet voice? <br/>
 <br/>
 It&#39;s ok to stop everything and hold them, milk be damned. Or perhaps offering an alternate solution: I would love to hold you, but I must get this milk in the frig. Can I hold you on the couch when we get home?  3 is a very hard age. I&#39;d just as soon find my 3 yo climbing the pantry, trying to sit on his baby sister, or jumping off the top bunk. I find helpful (for any age, really) the Ames & Ilg books. It helps give a handle on what they&#39;re doing developmentally, and while it doesn&#39;t solve anything for me, it does help give insight. I feel your frustration. I hope today is a better day! <br/>

*The above formula is from Non-Violent Communication, by Marshall Rosenberg. On the top of my recommended list for gentle parenting. <br/>

&gt; straight so that I <br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t put the straps on him, but I managed to get<br/>
&gt; him in and <br/>
&gt; everything fastened.  Then he started screaming at<br/>
&gt; me *Mom, shut up. <br/>
&gt; Mom, shut up.*  Over and over again he screamed,<br/>
&gt; with my bewildered <br/>
&gt; parents watching from the driveway.  I ignored him<br/>
&gt; and backed out of <br/>
&gt; the driveway with him screaming the whole way. <br/>
&gt; About five minutes <br/>
&gt; into the drive he told me that I wasn&#39;t his Mom<br/>
&gt; anymore.  At that <br/>
&gt; point my head was pounding.  I pulled the car over,<br/>
&gt; got out, opened <br/>
&gt; his door and got very close to his face.  I told him<br/>
&gt; that he could <br/>
&gt; not continue to talk to me that way, that he hurt my<br/>
&gt; feelings, and <br/>
&gt; then I did a bad thing.  I told him that I was<br/>
&gt; taking his brother to <br/>
&gt; McDonalds and that I didn&#39;t want to buy anything for<br/>
&gt; him.  That <br/>
&gt; seemed to get his attention, he wanted something,<br/>
&gt; too.  Now I never <br/>
&gt; intended to leave him out, but I told him that when<br/>
&gt; he hurt my <br/>
&gt; feelings like that it made me not want to buy him<br/>
&gt; something.  Please <br/>
&gt; understand that he had already eaten dinner at my<br/>
&gt; Mom&#39;s, I would <br/>
&gt; never withhold food as a punishment.  But at least<br/>
&gt; he stopped <br/>
&gt; screaming.  I got back in the driver&#39;s seat and we<br/>
&gt; had a discussion <br/>
&gt; about not telling each other to shut up because it<br/>
&gt; is a mean thing to <br/>
&gt; say.  My eleven year old was involved in this and<br/>
&gt; told me that he <br/>
&gt; understood now why I didn&#39;t like it when he said<br/>
&gt; this to his little <br/>
&gt; brother.  He even apoligized to Little bro for<br/>
&gt; having said it to him <br/>
&gt; in the past and made a pact to stop.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This was one outburst of anger, but they happen<br/>
&gt; several times a day.  <br/>
&gt; They usually consist of Joel growling and saying,<br/>
&gt; *I&#39;m so ANGRY with <br/>
&gt; you* over and over again.  And while I&#39;m glad he can<br/>
&gt; put his feelings <br/>
&gt; into words, it still feels violent.  How should I<br/>
&gt; handle these <br/>
&gt; outbursts of anger.  This is a new thing for him in<br/>
&gt; the last couple <br/>
&gt; of months. Is this just a stage?  Any help or advice<br/>
&gt; will be <br/>
&gt; appreciated.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-236746338">&lt;&lt;I&#39;ve been reading sstuff about mindful parenting and have never been <br/>
a spanker.  But recently my 3.5 year old has become a real <br/>
challange.  If something doesn&#39;t happen the way he wants it to he has <br/>
full blown tantrums.  Now I have seen this in other children, but <br/>
never in mine.  And do try to let him do the things he wants to do, <br/>
but here is an example of a time when he just can&#39;t do what he <br/>
wants.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Jayn is 4.5. Here&#39;s what I do (and have done for a long time) when it is<br/>
genuinely important that she do as I have asked her to - like ride in her<br/>
car seat, although we have never had that specific problem. I wait. Very<br/>
quietly and let her say &quot;no&quot; as many times as she needs to. Sometimes I<br/>
validate her feelings - &quot;you sure don&#39;t want to ....&quot; and I say &quot;Let me know<br/>
when you are ready&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
After a few minutes, that can actually *seem* very long to me, she will take<br/>
a deep breath and say, &quot;OK I guess I can ....&quot; Then she cheerfully, or even<br/>
giggling, does whatever it was. I always remember to thank her and give her<br/>
a hug. <br/>
<br/>
Learning to wait as long as needed was hard, and I&#39;m sure with a witness the<br/>
pause would be even harder. Like playing Chutes and Ladders or deschooling -<br/>
if you say anything to hurry the process - back you go to the beginning.<br/>
Getting dh not to interfere or try to jolly her along has been the biggest<br/>
hurdle!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;He told me to put the carseat in the driver&#39;s seat.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve got to admit that is pretty ingenious! When Jayn wants to &quot;drive&quot;, I<br/>
let her sit in the driver&#39;s seat with the car off and I sit next to her and<br/>
she makes all the noises. If you did that in your situation the other little<br/>
boy would probably need a turn too! Sometimes following Jayn&#39;s lead with the<br/>
little fantasy can be a great way to defuse the incipient meltdown (a word I<br/>
prefer to &quot;tantrum&quot; which is so negative) EG: Wow we could but what about<br/>
your feet? And where would I sit? Maybe we should put the car seat on the<br/>
roof. What about that idea?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Then he started screaming at me *Mom, shut up. <br/>
Mom, shut up.*  Over and over again he screamed, with my bewildered <br/>
parents watching from the driveway.  I ignored him and backed out of <br/>
the driveway with him screaming the whole way.  About five minutes <br/>
into the drive he told me that I wasn&#39;t his Mom anymore.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In the spirit of finding something good in this - be joyful that he knew he<br/>
could say this and you *would* still be his Mom. He could say something this<br/>
powerful and unpleasant secure in the knowledge that you still love him.<br/>
Sometimes Jayn is frustrated to the point of saying something like this. I<br/>
usually let it pass, because I am trying to get back to the source of the<br/>
upset, and this is just like noise or detritus. If you react to it, then it<br/>
becomes scary - for the child I mean. There are children in this world who<br/>
are afraid of their parents - they wouldn&#39;t ever say this in case it came<br/>
true in some way.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;I pulled the car over, got out, opened <br/>
his door and got very close to his face.  I told him that he could <br/>
not continue to talk to me that way, that he hurt my feelings, and <br/>
then I did a bad thing.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes Jayn gets in my face and will scream - one good loud shriek is<br/>
generally enough to let out her tension. I always feel bad that I let her<br/>
frustration with me get to that point. However it is very unpleasant to have<br/>
someone right in your face like that. Sometimes my dh has done it to me - it<br/>
is extremely intimidating. I have said sternly to Jayn, &quot;You may not scream<br/>
at me&quot; but I DON&#39;T recommend that at all, and it is usually because *I* have<br/>
lost my temper momentarily. It just makes her feel worse also. I try to hug<br/>
her instead at those moments. If screaming in the car is making it hard to<br/>
drive, I have pulled over - when I usually just wait quietly, similarly to<br/>
above, until the storm has passed.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;I got back in the driver&#39;s seat and we had a discussion <br/>
about not telling each other to shut up because it is a mean thing to <br/>
say.  My eleven year old was involved in this and told me that he <br/>
understood now why I didn&#39;t like it when he said this to his little <br/>
brother.  He even apoligized to Little bro for having said it to him <br/>
in the past and made a pact to stop.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This sounds really sweet, although I hope your 11yo doesn&#39;t feel bad if he<br/>
accidentally breaks the pact in the heat of some moment. I usually wait a<br/>
little while to talk about hurt feelings. Sometimes Jayn will suddenly say,<br/>
&quot;Are you sorry you hurt my feelings?&quot; and we have to dig around to find out<br/>
when it happened. Usually we apologize to each other shortly after whatever<br/>
blow up occurred. It seems to give her a great sense of power and esteem to<br/>
have me apologize to her.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;How should I handle these <br/>
outbursts of anger.  This is a new thing for him in the last couple <br/>
of months. Is this just a stage?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think it can be coming from a developmental stage, but it is still real in<br/>
the moment. I mean dismissing his anger as *merely* a stage, especially to<br/>
him or in his hearing, could make the stage last a lifetime. OTOH,<br/>
remembering that it will pass and he will learn to become more reasonable<br/>
(from an adult POV) may help you to keep calm and take deep breaths. My main<br/>
suggestion is not to take it personally, but yes to look for your<br/>
responsibility in causing the upset. Are you putting his needs aside for<br/>
household duties, or email checking (my usual bad)? Are you not noticing<br/>
quickly enough when he needs some extra moments? Is there some other kind of<br/>
broader change or upheaval going on in his life that is making him feel<br/>
powerless? You mention that your Mom is &quot;now&quot; caring for your nephew -<br/>
perhaps that is one of the life changes that is causing imbalance for a<br/>
while.<br/>
<br/>
There are some lovely essays at www.naturalchild.org including one entitled<br/>
something like &quot;Helping children heal from emotional hurts&quot; that is just<br/>
wonderful - talks about the power of silent listening. The whole site is<br/>
wonderful - and it has short readable chunks that are more digestible for<br/>
the uninitiated than being given a whole book to read at first. Book<br/>
recommendations are there also of course.<br/>

<br/>
It can be really powerful to look at a situation from a childs<br/>
perspective.  It&#39;s humbling to think about how small and powerless they<br/>
are.   It always helped me to be calm when I thought about what I looked<br/>
and sounded like from Dylan&#39;s point of view. <br/>

&gt;happy and feel good about himself and his mom.  If you think of the<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m just catching up with this list again tonight, and I&#39;m mostly <br/>
just reading along, but what Deb wrote here was so wise, and so <br/>
wonderfully worded, that I just wanted to say thank you for taking <br/>
the time to write it. Sometimes it seems like this electronic form of <br/>
communication is so fleeting and temporary; I often read through <br/>
upwards of 1,200 to 1,500 posts a day on all the various lists, <br/>
newsletters, business emailings and whatnot, and the majority are <br/>
just skimmed and deleted without a second thought. But every once in <br/>
a while a post just catches my attention and makes me stop and think <br/>
about why we do this, what it&#39;s really all about, and why it&#39;s <br/>
important to share thoughts and ideas and experiences with those who <br/>
come seeking and asking questions. Sometimes a post or a paragraph <br/>
just stands out, head and shoulders above the others, and for me this <br/>
post was one of those. Thanks Deb.<br/>
