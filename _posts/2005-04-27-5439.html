Hi Kim, I&#39;m not sure if anyone responded yet because my email inbox is a  <br/>
mess!  So at the risk of being redundant....<br/>
 <br/>
yes, Option 3 is the way to go.   I can give you more info, maybe  off-list?<br/>
 <br/>
We moved here from Jacksonville, NC last year and are a military  family.  We <br/>
are in Beaufort, where are you going to be?  <br/>
 <br/>
Kelly (one of this list&#39;s moderators) also has the schoolsoutsupport yahoo  <br/>
group that is a state-wide unschoolers&#39; list.<br/>
 <br/>
Good luck with your move....I am still not completely unpacked!   Ack!<br/>

Yes---log on to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:SchoolsOutSupport@yahoogroups.com">SchoolsOutSupport@yahoogroups.com</a> for the SC <br/>
unschoolers&#39; group. Leslie&#39;s begging for a Mom&#39;s Night Out in Columbia <br/>
one day soon, and I&#39;ve been trying to find a date for a CiCi&#39;s pizza <br/>
and Park Day in these next two weeks.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll look for you at SOS!<br/>
