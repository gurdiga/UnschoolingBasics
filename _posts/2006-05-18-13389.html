I am very interested in your article. <br/>
<br/>
I have a son just eight , who has been with us for just over  a <br/>
year. <br/>
Unschooling him and surrounding him in the safety of his family has <br/>
been the most healing thing in the world. <br/>
<br/>
I cannot imagine where we would be if we had been forced by the <br/>
state to put him in school. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1127331318">Great article Joanne!  I must say that most of your article applies to all<br/>
older children, biological or not.  there are a lot of things you mention<br/>
that compare to an older child that has spent a significant period of time<br/>
in the school system (mine was there for 7+years including pre-k & k) then<br/>
are removed to homeschool.  My son was dxed adhd at age 5 and though I<br/>
refused to medicate and we just worked through it by trying to give him<br/>
tools to use throughout the day (and he had a supportive teacher that<br/>
followed up on him through his elem. time), we had a hard time really<br/>
bonding because of all the struggles at school and with homework.  Since he<br/>
has been home and we have been implementing more unschooly ways, our bond is<br/>
getting much stronger.  I would encourage anyone who is thinking of taking<br/>
their older child out of the school system to homeschool/unschool to take<br/>
the leap and do it even if just for a year or two...it is amazing how<br/>
quickly our lack of bonding is beign repaired (of course I would like to<br/>
have those years back so we didn&#39;t have to be repairing)!  I am grateful<br/>
everyday of the fact I was introduced to unschooling.  It has been such a<br/>
blessing!<br/>
 <br/>
thank you for sharing your article!<br/>
 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2117336072"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Great article Joanne!  I must say that most of your article <br/>

<br/>
Ditto Joanne!   <br/>
<br/>
We, also, pulled our 13 yo dd out after 6th grade last June after <br/>
spending all of her life in school, and before that, daycare. She&#39;s <br/>
still deschooling and healing, but it&#39;s made such a difference in <br/>
our relationship and in how she &quot;IS&quot;.   She also was diagnosed with <br/>
ADHD, I refused to medicate, read everything I could get my hands <br/>
on, realize now it&#39;s her learning style (visual/spatial) and not <br/>
attentional issues that was causing the &quot;problems&quot; in school (hey, <br/>
who wouldn&#39;t be distracted when you aren&#39;t allowed your own thoughts <br/>
and to be able to go in the direction you want when you&#39;re in <br/>
school!).   I trusted myself when I felt she was suffocating.   It&#39;s <br/>
still a learning curve for us, but am taking it one day at a time.   <br/>
Coming here helps immensely!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I am grateful everyday of the fact I was introduced to unschooling.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would like to have those years back too, but we&#39;re moving <br/>
forward.  I&#39;m so glad to have found this way of life!<br/>
