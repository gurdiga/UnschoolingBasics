<div id="ygrps-yiv-660444832">When my kids were young, I knew I didn&#39;t want them co-sleeping with us when<br/>
they were 11 you know?  So I knew they would need to transition to a bed at<br/>
some point.  So they slept with us at night, and with me during the day if I<br/>
napped when they did, (my boys are 23 months apart so it worked brilliantly<br/>
with just one kid, harder to be able to nap with the second child when the<br/>
oldest wouldn&#39;t nap) or if I wasn&#39;t going to nap then they went into the<br/>
crib.  What this did was make the crib not be a bad place, and I had to have<br/>
a safe place to put the baby when I had to be available for the 2 yr old.<br/>
It worked for us and when the boys were ready for a bed (meaning they could<br/>
and did crawl out of the crib) we put bunk beds in their room and before<br/>
long they migrated in there on their own.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-513814446">Hi Julie,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pregnant and we are co-sleepers.  My youngest never had a crib. <br/>
What we did have was a pack and play with the bassinet.  (I have had<br/>
this for years and plan on using it again with my third. I think they<br/>
even make one that opens out on the bed)  Sometimes he napped in that,<br/>
sometimes he napped in the sling with my holding him, and sometimes he<br/>
napped in a bed or on even on the couch.  We just used pillows to<br/>
protect him from falling, which he never did.  <br/>
<br/>
When he got to crawling age, we just sort of let him nap, where he<br/>
lay.  Depending on what was happening in the house we moved him into<br/>
the bedroom if we needed to.  We did have a toddler bed, which worked<br/>
great for napping baby because it is very close to the floor.  He<br/>
could just get up when he wanted to.  I know someone who lay a futon<br/>
on the floor in baby&#39;s room and she still sleeps on it at age 5.  I<br/>
might take this idea this time around.<br/>
<br/>
It will really depend on your situation and what your comfortable with<br/>
in regards to safety and the dynamics in your household.  This time<br/>
around we have a small jumpy dog so we will most likely be using the<br/>
pack and play more for daytime-naps while the baby is little then we<br/>
have in the past.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-200330214">We just took the frame off our king-sized bed and set the box springs and<br/>
mattress on the carpeted floor in our bedroom.  We had a co-sleeper but<br/>
almost never used it.  We had a cradle swing that we used half the time for<br/>
naps because our son loved it.  The other half of the time he took naps<br/>
strapped to my back in his Kozi Carrier.  When he started crawling and<br/>
walking we just strapped all the furniture down and put locks on the all the<br/>
drawers so he wouldn&#39;t find anything he shouldn&#39;t before we realized he was<br/>
awake.  He rolled off the bed a couple of times but it wasn&#39;t far and it was<br/>
padded and he never seemed fazed by it at all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2052815134">I have always kept my 3 with me at night until they wanted their own<br/>
bed and we had enough room to provide them with a separate bed (my 11<br/>
y/o sleeps in her own bed {bwg}). For naps I just wear them (slind or<br/>
wrap) or put them to sleep near wherever I am, like bouncy chair if I<br/>
am doing dishes or on my bed if I am doing laundry. Also one of the<br/>
older kids will snuggle with a napping baby if they a sleepy or<br/>
watching TV. We have never owned a crib, at first no room but then no<br/>
desire.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1468804086">Congrats on your pregnancy!!  I have three kids (10,<br/>
6, and 2) and we have always co-slept.  Some places<br/>
the baby/toddler napped safely have been: <br/>
-on the bed while I layed next to her/him (even if I<br/>
didn&#39;t sleep, I could read to myself or to a sibling)<br/>
-on the bed while the rest of the family played<br/>
somewhat quietly in the room<br/>
- on the couch with a chair or pillows next to it to<br/>
block where the baby/toddler could fall<br/>
-on a crib mattress placed on the floor<br/>
-on some blankets placed on the floor<br/>
-in a bouncy type chair<br/>
-on couch cushions placed on the floor<br/>
-on a diaper changing pad on the floor<br/>
-on some blankets on the floor<br/>
-I held baby while doing various things while she<br/>
slept (simple cooking, playing with other kids,<br/>
reading, etc)<br/>
-dh held baby while baby slept<br/>
- on a blanket or bouncy chair placed on the grass<br/>
<br/>
My third child slept very peacefully in my arms most<br/>
of the time.  If I layed her down, the floor was my<br/>
favorite place her when she was an infant.  It was so<br/>
convienent and she couldn&#39;t roll off!  I just made a<br/>
comfortable nest and she was all set!  <br/>
<br/>
As she got older, the couch became my favorite place<br/>
to lay her down when she was sleeping.  When she was<br/>
at the stage where I thought she might wake up and<br/>
crawl or roll off or something, I made sure to have<br/>
cushions on the floor next to the couch or a chair the<br/>
same height pushed against the couch edge.  Many times<br/>
I stayed in the room to make sure that she was safe. <br/>
And there were lots of things to do in the same room<br/>
while she was sleeping...reading, internet, played<br/>
w/the other kids, etc.  As I felt more comfortable, I<br/>
sometimes began dinner (two rooms away) and just kept<br/>
an eye on her.  I always kept her on the same floor<br/>
with me (usually it was downstairs), so I had no fear<br/>
of her crawling toward the stairs or anything.  <br/>
<br/>
Did you ever read the book &quot;The Family Bed&quot; by Tine<br/>
Thevenin?  I have it, but haven&#39;t read it much to be<br/>
honest.  It is supposed to be wonderful.  By the time<br/>
I get to reading it, my kids will be grown!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1634992793">I cosleep with my 4 year old and 7 month old now. I have bedrails so I feel comfortable leaving my baby on the bed alone while he naps. He usually naps in the twin bed in my 4 year old&#39;s room so that I can do things in my room like take a shower without having to worry about waking him up. My 4 year old doesn&#39;t use it yet. The 7 month old is scooting himself around now and just started trying to pull himself up to standing so I&#39;ll need to change that. With my 4 year old we had the mattress and boxspring on the floor so, if he did scoot himself off, he didn&#39;t have far to fall and wouldn&#39;t get hurt. That never happened, though. This time I&#39;m thinking I&#39;ll just set up a sleeping mat on the floor in the other room for naps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-39430256">Hi Julie,    <br/>
    <br/>
My kids always slept with us..  I had the play n pack next to our bed available and used it when I/we needed more space.  they all went in there own beds between 2-2.5.  My 20mo old currently sleeps with us and has never lasted in his own bed for very long.  And I agree with Heather it all depends on your situation.  Safety is an issue.  I will say the bigger the bed the better so you can spread out so to speak!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2117742436">We are co-sleeping with our youngest (14 months).  When he sleeps <br/>
during the day it is on the couch in the lounge, with a large beanbag <br/>
beside him- he doesn&#39;t need it any more, but it gave me peave-of-mind <br/>
when he was smaller.<br/>

When he was really tiny, he used to sleep on the beanbag- which I also <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1578625848">Hi - There are co-sleepers that attached to the side of the bed, to keep  the <br/>
baby from falling out of the bed if you are not there; and/or to give extra  <br/>
room on the bed.  There are also rails that can attach to the side of the  bed <br/>
to keep the baby on the bed.  <br/>
 <br/>
Children go throw a few major independent surges in their life:  at  around <br/>
2,7, and 13.  When a child is ready to go into their own bed, they  will.  They <br/>
do not need to be taught/trained to sleep on their own nor  prepared to learn <br/>
to sleep on their own.  When they are ready, they will  go.  This will be a <br/>
different age for every child.  Just like every  child learns to count or read <br/>
or walk at a different age, each child will be  ready to sleep on their own at <br/>
a different age.  They won&#39;t need to be  coerced.  Just let nature takes its <br/>
course, and enjoy the beauty and  natural feeling of co-sleeping.<br/>
 <br/>
So, the bed that you sleep in at night can definitely be used for napping  <br/>
during the day.  This will allow consistence and security, which a baby  will <br/>
thrive on.  Some babies will nurse to sleep, and then you can slip  away.  Other <br/>
babies will want a warm body next to them the entire  time.  If that is the <br/>
case, many will have the baby sleep in a  sling......Anywhere!  You can do <br/>
things with your 3 year old, and sling the  baby along.<br/>
 <br/>
Congratulations on your upcoming baby!!<br/>
 <br/>
Warmly,<br/>
