Technically, you haven&#39;t really started homeschooling. You&#39;re simply <br/>
the parent of a three year old! It&#39;s exhausting! Around here, we say: <br/>
&quot;Two&#39;s a myth, Three&#39;s reality!&quot;---meaning &quot;you think you were tired <br/>
with a TWO year old?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I would really make sure your iron is in good shape. That&#39;s a HUGE <br/>
problem with me: low iron.<br/>
<br/>
Are you eating well?<br/>
<br/>
Are you depressed? That can cause exhaustion. But again---so can a <br/>
three year old! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Doe she nap? What do you do when he&#39;s napping? Please don&#39;t say &quot;the <br/>
laundry&quot;! You *should* be napping WITH him!<br/>
<br/>
Your mother-in-law is there, right? Why can&#39;t she watch him while you <br/>
nap? Is she trustworthy?<br/>
<br/>
Do you have a friend with whom you could trade days to watch each <br/>
other&#39;s kids for a few hours while you each nap?<br/>
<br/>
Is there a teen you could pay to watch him while you nap?<br/>
<br/>
Of course *he* doesn&#39;t understand that you need to nap. He&#39;s THREE! <br/>
He&#39;s always on the go! Energy to spare! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t stress enough that, even though you&#39;re feeling completely <br/>
exhausted now, he gets older every single day---and this won&#39;t last <br/>
forever! He really will be grown and gone before you know it. Find ways <br/>
to snatch naps---even just having your feet in a kiddie pool while he <br/>
splashes or sitting nearby while he plays legos or ....whatever you can <br/>
do while sitting while he plays. Sitting is under-rated! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

easy he was. Then he turned 3 and I thought my husband&#39;s head would <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Just in the past 2 months or so I&#39;ve found that I have a lot more <br/>
energy than before. I don&#39;t mind doing several errands in one day <br/>
whereas before I could only do one thing a day. I get out just for <br/>
fun or something to do a lot more, even when I wake up feeling <br/>
tired. I was talking to someone about it and wondering what had <br/>
happened. I couldn&#39;t think of anything that had changed, like <br/>
getting more sleep or eating better. This person mentioned that I <br/>
was not as worried and stressed over situations with my teenage son <br/>
or with my husband. Stress and worry can cause exhaustion, too. Once <br/>
I let go of that I felt like I could take on the world.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-124128371">I had never thought of iron depeletion being a possible factor and I&#39;ll keep that in mind.  I must admit that starting to adopt an unschooling lifestyle has been a complete life-changing decision for me.  I hve struggled with depression over the years and have found that I now feel no overwhelming stress.  I can deal with the problems that my kiddos have in a much more calm manner.  It&#39;s as though years of stress have been wiped away.  (If anyone out there have kids with special needs, you might know the stress of 2 with autism and trying to &quot;get their needs met&quot; in the school district ... ha ha ...)  I actually watch 4 kiddos after they get out of school (so there are 6 in my house for about 4 hours every day) and i have found that, by applying unschooling philosophies to my interactions with them as well as my boys, I feel happy and much more energized at the end of the day.  I have been absolutely amazed!   <br/>
