Lisa,<br/>
We just came back from a 2 day competitive cheer event in CT, there were a <br/>
few special needs groups performing - any possibility you were there?<br/>
<br/>
AND will you be going to Live and Learn Conference?  My 14yo dd will be <br/>
running a cheer workshop.  She&#39;s done this is the past and the kids have <br/>
performed at the talent show.  Just last night she asiked me to post on the <br/>
loops to see if there are any older kids who cheer that would be willing to <br/>
work with her at the conference demonstrating some stunts.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We did have a competition last weekend but it was a local one here in<br/>
NC... we want to attend the conference but still haven&#39;t decided for<br/>
sure we can do it this time (I know it&#39;s here in NC it kills me to<br/>
think we may not make it!!!)   At any rate Ainsley, our 11 yr old is<br/>
having scoliosis surgery on April 23rd so she will be out of<br/>
commission as far as cheering goes for the next 6 months... depending<br/>
on her recovery she might be able to do a little by the conference but<br/>
definitely no stunts by then!   It would be great to meet everyone at<br/>
the conference... I really need to sit down and crunch the numbers and<br/>
see if we can do it!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We started saving last summer for the conference - deciding we never want to <br/>
miss one again.  Putting dollar bills and coins in a jar everyday...All the <br/>
pet sitting money has gone to the conference...There are times i say to the <br/>
kids when they want something, &quot;we could do that - or we could put the money <br/>
towards the unschoolers conference.&quot;  I also look at it as an important part <br/>
of the cost of homeschooling...it serves our whole family so well to be at <br/>
these conferences.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you can find a way.<br/>
