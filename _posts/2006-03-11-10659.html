Currently my 9 year old and his dad are into halo, and I&#39;m getting that same quessy feeling when my 6 year old daughter pulls up a chair and starts walking around with a semi automatic attached to her hand. I think I&#39;ll go read this article again to remind myself, she is exploring safely with a parent available to discuss what she is experiencing.<br/>
