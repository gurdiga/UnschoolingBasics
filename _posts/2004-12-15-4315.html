<div id="ygrps-yiv-1681288885">Please help me.  I&#39;m shaking and crying.  I just blew up at my kids <br/>
big time.  I&#39;m just sick.<br/>
<br/>
Background-4 kids-ds9, ds7, ds5, dd2<br/>
Have homeschooled all along.  I&#39;ve always been relaxed, but gradually <br/>
shifted to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
My kids fight all the time.  I repeat, all the time.  They fight over <br/>
everything.  I&#39;m going insane.  Here are examples just from today:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m on the couch reading to dd2 while ds7 is building with blocks at <br/>
my feet.  Dd5 comes into the room sort of walking/wiggling/being a <br/>
little boy.  As he gets closer to me I say, &quot;Be Careful of ds7&#39;s <br/>
tower.&quot;  At that point he wiggles his hips extra hard and his leg <br/>
knocks over the whole thing.  Ds7 jumps on him from behind and <br/>
tackles him.  &quot;How come you knocked over my tower??!!!&quot;  (hit, <br/>
hit)  &quot;Leave my stuff alone&quot; (hit,hit)  Ds5 starts sobbing.<br/>
<br/>
Later.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sitting down and ds7 comes over to show me something he just read <br/>
in a magazine. While he&#39;s talking to me ds5 comes and leans on ds7 <br/>
hard enough for him to fall over.  I said `Please stop&#39;.  He didn&#39;t, <br/>
knocked ds7 over, ds7 got up and kicked ds5.<br/>
<br/>
Later.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m making brownies as we&#39;re going to a friend&#39;s house for supper.  <br/>
I&#39;m starting the filling and ds9 calls &quot;Can I like the filling bowl <br/>
when you&#39;re done?&quot; I say yes.  Ds7 pipes up &quot;Hey, I want to lick the <br/>
filling bowl.&quot;  I say &quot;You can lick the frosting bowl when I make <br/>
that this afternoon.&quot;  Ds5 says &quot;Hey that&#39;s not fair!  I want <br/>
something to lick.&quot;  I say &quot;Well you can help me make the frosting.&quot;  <br/>
OK everything seems fine.<br/>
<br/>
I make the filling, give the bowl to ds9.  Ds7 says &quot;can&#39;t I have <br/>
just a little?&quot;  &quot;No!&quot; says ds9, &quot;Mom said I could have it.&quot;  Later <br/>
when I give the frosting bowl to ds7, ds 5 starts crying &quot;How come I <br/>
don&#39;t have anything to lick?&quot;  I ask ds7 if he&#39;d like to share.  Of <br/>
course, he wouldn&#39;t.  Now dd2 starts cryingshe wants to lick <br/>
something.  I have nothing more to offer!  Everyone is mad.<br/>
<br/>
Later.<br/>
<br/>
Dd2 asks for a poptart.  I say yes and get it for her.  There&#39;s two <br/>
left in the package.  (you already know what&#39;s coming, right?)  I <br/>
hand her one; she asks for the other.  She has never, never, never <br/>
eaten more than one pop tart, she gets too full.  I tell her to eat <br/>
the first one and then we&#39;ll see if she&#39;s still hungry.  At that <br/>
point ds5 grabs the second pop tart off the counter and runs way <br/>
shouting &quot;It&#39;s mine It&#39;s mine.  I&#39;m having this pop tart.&quot;  Dd 2 <br/>
starts screaming.  I asked ds5 to please give the pop tart back to me <br/>
and we&#39;d try to work something out.  &quot;No&quot; he says and turns around to <br/>
try to hold it out of my reach. I try to grab it and think `this is <br/>
crazy, I&#39;m not going to get into a grabbing match with a 5yo.&quot;  Now <br/>
ds7 is crying there&#39;s no pop tarts left for him and I know ds9 is <br/>
going to throw a huge fit (crying, stomping) when he gets home from a <br/>
friend&#39;s house and sees there aren&#39;t any left.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose I could go buy more Pop tarts at the store, but I couldn&#39;t <br/>
go this exact minute and when would it end.  How many pop tarts would <br/>
I have to buy to make everyone happy?<br/>
<br/>
I finally just blew up and yelled and stomped out of the room and <br/>
into my bedroom where I locked the door.  Not the most mature thing, <br/>
but I was scared I was going to abuse my children if I didn&#39;t leave <br/>
the room NOW.<br/>
<br/>
This is just a small sampling.  It&#39;s all the time.  Fighting over <br/>
everything, being so cruel to one another.  Sometimes I feel they&#39;d <br/>
be better off on a ps playground then home with siblings.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read these boards for years.  I try to breathe.  I say Yes <br/>
whenever I can.  I try to be gentle and calm.  I try to give everyone <br/>
tons of attention.  I&#39;m just stretched too thin.  I feel as if <br/>
someone is always whining or crying or complaining or grumbling.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m at the end of my rope.  Sandra, Ren, Kelly, others.please help.<br/>
Sorry if you are reading this more than once.  I&#39;m going to post it <br/>
on a few boards.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1209315690">I don&#39;t know where you live but I would suggest an outing.  This time of<br/>
year we go looking for a grand Yule Log (actually a piece of Juniper that<br/>
has fallen).  We gather berries, various organic material and hot glue it to<br/>
the log.  It then gets the place of honor in the fire place until the<br/>
Solstice.<br/>
<br/>
When we look back on all those old holiday movies, you notice that the<br/>
people are always baking, doing crafts, singing.  I think we might have<br/>
something to learn there.  Kids ARE nuts during this time.  The media and<br/>
society, sometimes family, have them hyped up to the nth degree.  We have<br/>
found that if we turn everything non-Christmas to the back burner and spend<br/>
this week with an activity each day, it helps tremendously.  Doesn&#39;t have to<br/>
cost money, does take patience and a happy attitude.<br/>

But it doesn&#39;t have to be. We haven&#39;t seen that at all with DS (6 <br/>
1/2) because we just have never &quot;bought in&quot; to the media and society <br/>
and family hype. We don&#39;t write letters to Santa, we don&#39;t leave out <br/>
milk and cookies (and carrots for the reindeer), he chooses whether <br/>
or not to get a picture with Santa (usually a disinterested No <br/>
thanks), his presents under the tree are from &quot;Mommy and Daddy&quot; <br/>
(with the occasional package from Mrs. Claus that my mom ships up <br/>
instead of waiting until we get down there). We do love to watch all <br/>
the holiday classics, especially things like Charlie Brown and the <br/>
old Grinch and Rudolph and all and we went to see Polar Express <br/>
which was pretty cool (but not the IMAX - I get motion sick at those <br/>
bleh) so it&#39;s not like he doesn&#39;t know these things happen. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been to the mall TWICE this past week (the height of holiday <br/>
madness for some) and both times we had an absolute BLAST. The first <br/>
time, we looked at and he played with some RC cars (really cool) but <br/>
they were $40 which we didn&#39;t have at the time available to spend. <br/>
So, we looked, played, talked about how neat they were, how much <br/>
they cost, reminded each other to tell DH (who was hiking out to the <br/>
car to save us the walk) about them, went and looked at puppies, got <br/>
some chocolate at Godiva (mmmm!) and left the mall. No fuss, no <br/>
whine, nada. Then last night we decided to go eat at the food court <br/>
and people watch. After eating, we browsed around and found the RC <br/>
vehicles again (after I got to go look at puppies - we&#39;ve got two <br/>
big dogs but I love/hate looking in the pet store). DS got to drive <br/>
a different one, DH and I consulted and we got a car and a hover <br/>
craft type thingie (payday occurred in between Sunday and Thursday). <br/>
No mysterious packages, no &quot;wait until Christmas&quot; or ducking back <br/>
there secretly. We just took them home and DH and DS played with <br/>
them (took the hovercraftie outside to see the lights hovering in <br/>
the air in the pitch dark - cool!). They had just enough life in the <br/>
rechargeable batteries for about 30 minutes of play, then they got <br/>
plugged in and we headed up to bed for more of DH&#39;s wonderful <br/>
character voices reading Captain Underpants.</div>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m so sorry you&#39;re going through this.<br/>
A few years ago I wrote something very similar to another list when <br/>
I thought *I* was going to lose it with my kids fighting.<br/>
Actually there were several times.  The examples you gave I can *so* <br/>
relate to- the details are different from one incident to the next <br/>
but the overall theme stays frustratingly the same, doesn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
My boys are now 11, 9, and 5.  I think the worst point was around <br/>
the time my older 2 boys were around 6 and 8.   Even though I never <br/>
actually went through with it (thankfully) there were times I almost <br/>
put them in school because I didn&#39;t think I could survive another <br/>
day without a break from constant bickering.  <br/>
So I won&#39;t give you band-aid solutions for those examples, because I <br/>
know from experience that if it&#39;s not one thing it&#39;s something else, <br/>
almost like they need to get animosity toward each other out of <br/>
their systems or something.<br/>
  <br/>
I can promise you that it gets better.  Now that they&#39;re older it&#39;s <br/>
definitely lessened and they are good friends more often than not.<br/>
I can also say that then, and even now (but especially then), having <br/>
another child over changed the dynamic considerably and there was <br/>
*much* less fighting.  Several friends would be even better- more <br/>
chaos and clean-up and noise, but LESS FIGHTING!  I&#39;ll take it. :-)<br/>
I also figured out that validation without judgement of each child&#39;s <br/>
feelings towards the other helped a *lot* more than shaming or <br/>
chiding them for such feelings.  This helps even now... if my oldest <br/>
needs to vent I just listen without adding my own emotional baggage <br/>
to what he&#39;s saying.  For example, he might need to tell me <br/>
privately in a moment of anger that sometimes he wishes his brother <br/>
had never been born, that he &quot;hates&quot; him, that he drives him crazy, <br/>
etc.   Saying &quot;well but he&#39;s a part of this family and you have to <br/>
learn to get along!&quot; doesn&#39;t help at all, but &quot;I know how you feel, <br/>
I used to feel like that sometimes toward my sister when I was <br/>
growing up.  It&#39;s *hard* to have a brother around all the time isn&#39;t <br/>
it?&quot; really does help.  He&#39;s able to release the anger and go back <br/>
to being his brother&#39;s buddy more quickly.<br/>
<br/>
I also think it&#39;s important to get one on one time with each child.  <br/>
My children, especially when they were younger, were truly different <br/>
people one at a time than when with their brothers.  I think it&#39;s <br/>
important for each child to be the only kid around sometimes, and I <br/>
also think it&#39;s important for *you* to get to know each child as an <br/>
individual outside of the context of sibling dynamics.  This is more <br/>
practical for some people than it is for others, but if it&#39;s at all <br/>
possible it *really* helps if only to get a glimpse of who they <br/>
really are and to try to remember that when the together-times are <br/>
rough.  <br/>
<br/>
It really does pass.  <br/>
I hope something in there is helpful.<br/>
