<div id="ygrps-yiv-1278814429">We&#39;ve only been unschooling for about 6 months, but I have a suggestion.  For a long time I have been interested in cleaning our home with products that wouldn&#39;t kill my children if they drank them.  Perhaps consider ridding your home of the toxic stuff and moving to natural/biodegradable cleaning products?  There are lots out there to choose from.  My sister in the US gets her favourite ones at Trader Joe&#39;s.  I also want to my kids to see that dh and I care tons about our planet and are doing everything we can to preserve it for them.<br/>
   <br/>
  Since our girls are only 3, we keep sharp/dangerous things up very high or out in the garage.  They have started using paring knives in the kitchen and are quite fascinated with the whole process of cutting, but I don&#39;t leave the knives out for them to use when I&#39;m not in the room with them.<br/>
   <br/>
  IMO, there&#39;s trust *and* there&#39;s common sense safety.<br/>

feel pretty betrayed if you left poisons where they could drink them!<br/>
<br/>
Kids can learn to handle knives (This has been discussed several  <br/>
times and if you put knives into the search of the archives, that  <br/>
should pull them up.)<br/>
<br/>
Put breakables up or away so they don&#39;t even ask. If they do you can  <br/>
show them how to hold them gently. But it&#39;s a lot more peaceful to  <br/>
get them out of sight.<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately it depends on the kids, depends what they&#39;re asking for.<br/>

 &gt; childproofing(locking up poisonous cleaning solutions, sharp objects<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i like the idea of creating an empowering environment for a toddler/  <br/>
baby rather than thinking of it as childproofing.<br/>
<br/>
It might sound like im quibbling over terms, well i guess i am ï¿½ but  <br/>
for me it has been a shift in what im doing and the way im thinking.<br/>
<br/>
for me childproofing was more about protection and fear. While  <br/>
creating an empowering environment is about really trying to view  <br/>
things through a child&#39;s eyes and imagine what could assist their  <br/>
exploration and feeling of power. Something like that was inherent in  <br/>
the reply that Joyce gave to this thread but for me its still a very  <br/>
conscious/ slow process.<br/>
<br/>
So it has meant that we have removed some breakables that are  <br/>
particularly important to us as but it has also led to other things  <br/>
like:<br/>
- having an easily accessible cupboard with some crackers and fruit  <br/>
that our now 23 month old ds can access<br/>
- having his water bottle in the same spot in the kitchen also where  <br/>
he can access it without having to rely on us<br/>
- having a step ladder for him to be part of juicing, doing dishes,  <br/>
crumbing fish etc when he wants to<br/>
<br/>
actually part of me dreads &quot;the sound&quot; when im in a hurry cooking  <br/>
dinner. It sounds like twenty ducks are being squashed by a steam  <br/>
roller... slowly! Its actually the sound of the step ladder being  <br/>
dragged to where i am by ds so he can help out.... its good because  <br/>
he can do it without asking me for help and in the time it takes for  <br/>
him to get to me i have usually gotten rid of any attachment for a  <br/>
quick or clean dinner preparation  ;)<br/>
<br/>
our ds was pulling his step ladder to the gas stove for a while and  <br/>
trying to play with matches. We allowed him to do it with us and feel  <br/>
the heat from the stove and the matches and he has since learning to  <br/>
have a healthy respect for fire, while maintaining his interest in  <br/>
it. It felt like a better solution than trying to work out how to  <br/>
childproof the oven.<br/>
<br/>
all the best,<br/>

<br/>
Also, I feel so dumb, I meant to say, &quot;share some insight&quot; instead <br/>
of &quot;shed some insight&quot;, because even tho I live in the Talibama, I do <br/>
know how to speak LOL....<br/>

I think it only makes sense to protect your children. But there are <br/>
plenty of *safe* cleaners out there. We don&#39;t have any really yucky <br/>
cleaners.<br/>
<br/>
Both my boys have used knives since they were tiny. Both have cut <br/>
themselves too. I figure that&#39;s why they make band-aids. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I gave myself a gorgeous set of new knives a year or two ago. Cut <br/>
myself every single day for a month until I got used to handling such <br/>
sharp playthings! &lt;G&gt; You&#39;d think it would take so long to learn to be <br/>
careful. Maybe someone should have kept them out of *my* reach! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2125748653">Thank you all for this particular discussion. I was lying in bed<br/>
getting ready for sleep the other night and thinking about spring<br/>
coming and the windows being open, and that led me to wonder how to<br/>
handle things like childproofing windows in the context of unschooling<br/>
and trusting your kids. I like the idea of providing a safe<br/>
environment for them to explore rather than thinking of it as<br/>
&quot;childproofing&quot; (doesn&#39;t that make it sound like it&#39;s the child who&#39;s<br/>
dangerous?); not forbidding things outright but gently and carefully<br/>
providing somewhere they can explore. I am reading this avidly right<br/>
now because I know I tend to be a worrywart and I&#39;d like to think<br/>
about ways to handle that when we have kids before they&#39;re actually<br/>
here!<br/>
<br/>
Someone asked about cleaning products. I do most of my cleaning with<br/>
soap (castile) and water, vinegar, baking soda, and lemons sometimes.<br/>
I use honey as a face wash and baking soda and vinegar as shampoo.<br/>
Using these things was initially motivated by trying to leave a<br/>
smaller footprint on the earth; then I realized it was also cheaper,<br/>
safer for my family, and better for my allergies. I have &quot;all-purpose<br/>
cleaner&quot; mixed up in a spray bottle; it&#39;s just diluted white vinegar<br/>
with a little bit of liquid castile soap and a few drops of lavender<br/>
essential oil. This is just as convenient as the storebought type, at<br/>
least so far for me.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;ll be watching this thread!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2126726728">Really! Just straight honey, preferably raw but I have been using some<br/>
I already had. Just make sure to &quot;scrub&quot; well with your fingertips.<br/>
You can mix it with a little baking soda once a week for exfoliation,<br/>
too. I moisturize with straight jojoba oil after. My skin is prone to<br/>
breakouts and this has actually reduced them, weird as it sounds! I<br/>
read about it on mothering.com&#39;s forums.<br/>
