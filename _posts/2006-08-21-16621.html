<div id="ygrps-yiv-434405092">Jared (5yo) just picked out Kingdom Hearts from the Video store today.  <br/>
We got a used copy, and there was no book in there.  I&#39;m trying to <br/>
figure out who&#39;s who and what we&#39;re supposed to do.  Also, is there any <br/>
way to turn on the dialog in this game?  He can&#39;t read yet, so he&#39;s <br/>
constantly getting me to &quot;come read this!&quot;.  I did find a very lengthy <br/>
(166pg) walkthru, but I&#39;m looking for something more concise.<br/>
<br/>
Any helpful tips and tricks would be most appreciated!  Feel free to <br/>
email me privately.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My daughter used Game FAQs a lot:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/">http://www.gamefaqs.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
In addition to walkthroughs, they often have other types of FAQs for  <br/>
each game, like lists of enemies and so forth.<br/>
<br/>
And if you type in &quot;kingdom hearts strategy guide&quot; at Amazon there  <br/>
are bound to be some used guides for a few dollars. They have maps  <br/>
and charts and lists galore. As a bonus to being useful for the game,  <br/>
a great *real* exposure to math being put to real uses.<br/>

We just bought this game for my hubby for father&#39;s day, and he loves <br/>
it.  We have the booklet, so anything you want to know, just ask.  <br/>
He did tell me, most of the time, you just get what the character <br/>
says in words.  He had mentioned something about photocopying the <br/>
booklet for you, and scanning it to your email.  We don&#39;t have a <br/>
scanner here  at home, but maybe he does at work.  Let me know what <br/>
you need.<br/>
