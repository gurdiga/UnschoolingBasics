<div id="ygrps-yiv-1885369412">For Christmas, I gave myself a present....the collection of CDs from the conference.  I haven&#39;t had a chance to go through all of them, but the ones I have listened to are terrific and really have affirmed our family&#39;s decision to unschool.  Kelly&#39;s talk had me laughing (Tristan even came downstairs and asked where the party was since there was so much laughing...from both me and on the CD), while Ren and Sandra&#39;s discussion had me nearly in tears.  <br/>
<br/>
For anyone looking for a bit of a confidence builder when it comes to unschooling, I highly recommend these CDs!<br/>

I didn&#39;t realize he talked about that at the conference! I need to pull out that CD today!! &lt;vbg&gt;  Jody was just asking me about homeschooling kids and college.<br/>
