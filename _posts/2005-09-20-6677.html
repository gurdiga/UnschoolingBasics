<div id="ygrps-yiv-1582966658">I feel the need to weigh in on this from a few different fronts.  This hits<br/>
close to home, for my husband thinks that this is acceptable.  He grew up<br/>
idolizing the dictionary and somehow feels that by being made to look up<br/>
words, my kids will share his love of the book.<br/>
I, on the otherhand, liken the situation to how we would treat our spouses<br/>
or friends if they asked what something meant.  Would we tell them &quot;look it<br/>
up!&#39;?  What if we were travelling in a foreign land and needed assistance<br/>
with a sign or menu, and the person who we asked , noticing or phrasebook,<br/>
said &quot;look it up!&quot;.  Aside from the obvious rudeness of it, aren&#39;t we trying<br/>
to help our kids understand the world, enjoy their reading, etc.?  I know<br/>
that if I&#39;m reading and I come across a word I&#39;m unfamiliar with I&#39;ll guess<br/>
at it&#39;s meaning and continue on.  If I&#39;m REALLY interested I&#39;ll look it up<br/>
later.<br/>
Ultimately we&#39;re here to help our kids out, not put roadblocks in their<br/>
path.  It&#39;s easy enough to show them the dictionary and how it&#39;s used,<br/>
trusting that if they wanted to look up a word ( or were able) they would.<br/>
But in my humble opininion asking for a definition is no different than<br/>
asking for a glass of milk, I&#39;d rather furnish it lovingly than telling them<br/>
to get it themselves.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-491523147">The way I see it, telling a child &quot;Look it up&quot; is equivalent to saying<br/>
&quot;that information isn&#39;t important enough for me to waste my time on it<br/>
- go waste your own time finding it out.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
However, &quot;I&#39;m not sure - let&#39;s look it up!&quot;  has an entirely different meaning.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1508360343">Remember me the what if they go to the &quot;k&quot; section for<br/>
Cat.  LOL  Today my children and I played scrabble and<br/>
we played it the way that my mom and I did and still<br/>
do.  We don&#39;t play &quot;challenge&quot;, we look up in the<br/>
Scrabble dictionary to see if we can find words.  This<br/>
drives my hubby insane and he will not play with me<br/>
because I know words that start with &quot;Q&quot; and have not<br/>
the &quot;u&quot;.  Anyway, too funny.  My 7yo dd said, &quot;Mom,<br/>
can I spell &quot;k-a-t&quot;, I said &quot;I don&#39;t know. Let me look<br/>
it up here in the Scrabble dictionary.&quot;  Sure enough<br/>
there is &quot;k-a-t&quot; meaning an evergreen shrub!  Who&#39;d<br/>
have known?  My 11yo ds said, &quot;Yeah, now when someone<br/>
says &#39;Hey, whats up Cat&#39; you can say, you mean the<br/>
animal or the shrub?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Okay, well not hysterical but it put a smile on my<br/>
face and we had a ball doing &quot;spelling/vocabulary&quot;<br/>
today. :-)<br/>
