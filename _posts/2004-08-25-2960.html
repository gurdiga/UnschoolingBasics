<div id="ygrps-yiv-1331725769">Hi there!!<br/>
<br/>
My name is Kim.  I&#39;ve been lurking here since the beginning and I <br/>
feel like I should introduce myself.  I live in Southeastern MA with <br/>
my husband and my 2.5 yr old dd.<br/>
<br/>
We undoubtedly plan to unschool and this board has been a wonderful <br/>
help!  We&#39;re working on deschooling ourselves which is a tough job.  <br/>
<br/>
It just amazes me at how completely different the world seems the <br/>
more and more I read about unschooling.  Sometimes I start to feel <br/>
like I&#39;m in the Twilight Zone.  So much that I&#39;ve been conditioned <br/>
to believe is so was just wrong.  It&#39;s pretty scary sometimes to <br/>
feel like you&#39;re alone in your thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
Looking into this has also brought us to the idea of unjobbing as <br/>
well.  Now if I could only figure out how to make that work too.  <br/>
The consumer in me is having a hard time with that!! LOL!!<br/>
<br/>
We are going to conference this weekend!!!  So, hopefully we&#39;ll meet <br/>
some of you there!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Do you know about the NewEnglandUnschooling list? :-)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not overly busy but it&#39;s a great way to connect to other unschoolers in<br/>
the area :-)<br/>
