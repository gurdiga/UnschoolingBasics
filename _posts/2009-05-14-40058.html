<div id="ygrps-yiv-1950309663">I am usually coming to this list when I am freaking out or having a problem so wanted to share how proud I am of my wonderful girl today.  Lately she has been exploring friendships with a wider variety of people and has been hanging out with a group in our neighborhood.  It is pretty much the skater kids hanging out in the empty parking lot.  It has made me nervous at times because she&#39;s told me about some fighting and kids getting jumped and I worry she will get hurt.   We talk a lot about these things though and I let her know why I worry and let her know I will always be there for her if she gets in trouble.  I don&#39;t always approve of what is going on but it&#39;s pretty typical teen stuff and I would rather know and struggle with it than have her lie to me.   <br/>
<br/>
On Tuesday night she was hanging around our house and my mom was home but I was out.   They were hanging out in our yard when one of the girls decided she wanted to fight another girl.  The other girl did not want to fight and Liz told her they were not going to fight in our yard.  When the first girl started really pushing it Liz stepped between them grabbed her arm and told her no.  When she still didn&#39;t stop Liz told her she had to leave.   Everyone else in the group gave her a hug and left.   Liz came inside with the girl that did not want to fight, let my mom know she was in for the night and everyone else was going home and locked the door.  <br/>
<br/>
There was no yelling or anxiety she was totally in control of the situation.  It was awesome to hear that she handled herself and managed the situation with so much maturity.  It makes it worth how much I have been struggling with letting her go do her own thing and trust her.   It hasn&#39;t been easy but now I am really seeing that she really can handle herself mcuh more than I thought and she knows I am there if she needs me.   The trust between us is developing and I am so happy and proud of us both.<br/>
