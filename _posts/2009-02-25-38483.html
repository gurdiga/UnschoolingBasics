<div id="ygrps-yiv-1031888965">My 11 yr old dd is barely a reader at all. She cannot read a book all the<br/>
way through, she can sound out some words and recognize others, but all in<br/>
all, not a fluent reader. She went to school thru 2nd grade and was labeled<br/>
dyslexic, put in special ed classes. Even after I brought her home, I looked<br/>
to getting her help. All of which I highly regret. She is now recovering<br/>
from being made to feel less than she was, that she wasn&#39;t good enough. I am<br/>
just letting her heal and not bringing up &quot;learning to read&quot;. She reads some<br/>
things on her own, many others she asks me or her older sister what it says.<br/>
It does hinder her some, there are some classes she is interested in,<br/>
cooking for instance, but she won&#39;t take because you have to read things in<br/>
them. It worries me some, but I think letting her heal is the best thing to<br/>
do.<br/>
<br/>
All that to say, I don&#39;t think pushing him to read things he&#39;s not<br/>
interested in will help him. I&#39;m not sure what you mean by graphic novels,<br/>
but Eyewitness books are wonderful and full of great, interesting things, it<br/>
sounds great to me. He might not ever be interested in reading novels, but<br/>
more informational books, there&#39;s nothing wrong with that! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2130330346">Have you read graphic novels? There are some amazing graphic novels. Watchman, Persepolis, Maus these are all fantastic books, fantastics pieces of art. I saw the pages from Maus at MOMA in New York years ago. Art Speigelman won a Pulitzer Prize Letters Award for Maus. Bone, I love Bone. I could go on. They aren&#39;t minor things, they aren&#39;t distractions from literature, they are literature. Neil Gaiman&#39;s Sandman is such a weaving of mythology and cynicism and story telling, it is as real a book as any other book. Grant Morrison&#39;s Animal Man discusses vegetarianism, social issues, the context of being a superhero and having a life. Alan Moore&#39;s MiracleMan discusses some similar ideas. If you want to look at it, for yourself, from an academic perspective Scott McCloud did a comic book called Understanding Comics (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.scottmccloud.com/2-print/1-uc/index.html)">http://www.scottmccloud.com/2-print/1-uc/index.html)</a> which talks about the combination of a visual medium with a literary medium and all that<br/>
 comes within that. <br/>
<br/>
They are real books. I have re-tellings of different stories as graphic novels and while there may be fewer words, the books aren&#39;t any less complicated for the accompanying pictures. Why do you feel that graphic novels are less than other books? How do you define a real book? <br/>

<br/>
Imagine yourself as him... You&#39;re happily enjoying your little world created<br/>
by the graphic novel in front of you and each time your loved one walks<br/>
through the room, you either hear or feel their dismay with your choice. How<br/>
long would that person remain loved by you?<br/>
I hope not very long.  Chances are, you don&#39;t have much opportunity to<br/>
remain loved by your son, either.<br/>
Please honor his joy. It really is the *least* you can do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1000857607">I wrote my first response, running around the house for a couple of minutes to find Scott McCloud&#39;s book (I couldn&#39;t remember his name) and after I&#39;d written it I had a few other thoughts. <br/>
<br/>
Why do you read? Really. I read to get information, to engage and amuse me, to pass time, because words are in front of my face. Why do you want your 11 year old son to read? What do you think pressing him to read &quot;real&quot; books will do? How would encouraging him to read &quot;real&quot; books look? If David, my husband, came to me and told me that he thought I was reading too much Terry Pratchett and not enough of the classics I would get pretty irritated. And it wouldn&#39;t make me feel good about my choices, nor would it make me feel fonder of him. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1382641481">I was labeled a slow reader in school. I had to go to a tutor in 3rd grade  <br/>
to catch up with the other kids. I never enjoyed reading and I didn&#39;t have the  <br/>
capacity to sit and read for more then a few minutes. My mind kept wandering <br/>
to  other things and I would have read the whole page and not remembered a <br/>
thing.  When I was in 8th grade (around 13) I read a VC Andrews book that <br/>
belonged to my  sister and I fell in love with reading. I couldn&#39;t get enough. I <br/>
loved that  there were more books with the same story, and I hated that the <br/>
stories would  eventually come to an end. (I still am that way...LOL) There was <br/>
nothing that  anyone could have done for me to prepare me to read &quot;books&quot;. My <br/>
parents tried  and my teachers tried but my mind was not yet ready. I love reading <br/>
today  thankfully but sometimes I feel like &quot;the stupid one in class&quot; even <br/>
though they  never told it to me but because I always needed extra help or <br/>
someone was  telling me I should be at this level. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1572337999">I have to second your recommendation.  I was a &quot;real book&quot; reader as <br/>
a kid and did not discover graphic novels until introduced to them as <br/>
an adult.  Many have the same depth of character, theme, and plotting <br/>
of &quot;real books&quot;.  I&#39;d go one further on Understanding Comics, a book <br/>
I also really like.  I would get a copy, read it, then casually leave <br/>
it around the house where your son could find it and pick it up.  <br/>
Maybe while casually leaving some sketch paper and good quality <br/>
colored pencils lying about.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-876562714">Most people worry when you unschool about reading and math.  Funny, my husband never read a book in his life (although he was supposed to in school) until one year ago.  There was never any need to read for him.  He is successful, funny, easy to talk to (unless you are discussing Shakespeare or Dickens and who really cares???) and now he reads a lot of stuff that interests him.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I, on the other hand, could read 24 hours a day - mysteries, romances, suspense, classics, adventure - I don&#39;t care.  I can honestly say that my husband is more educated and knowledgeable about the world than I am, and I have been reading &quot;real&quot; books all my life.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My only point in saying all this is why do we put so much emphasis on reading anyway??  In the schools you hear things like &quot;Those that read, succeed.&quot;  Although I would love it if my boys read (they don&#39;t much) it is really only because I know how much I enjoy it and think they would, too.  I guess everyone has different things that interest them and we should respect that.  I just choose to have my discussions about Dante or Dickens or Shakespeare with someone other than my husband.  That doesn&#39;t make him any less of a person and you shouldn&#39;t worry about your son being less &quot;educated&quot; or whatever your worries are.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
REALLY?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OK---worst case scenario: he never reads another book. Ever. Would that make him &quot;less than&quot;&#39; who he is?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What if you forced him to read the classics? What if that turned him off from reading altogether? This was the case with my son, Cameron. In school, he was required to read all sorts of books. After he left school (end of sixth grade), he refused to read books for *years*. Six years, if I&#39;m not mistaken. Then he chose to read Rue Kream&#39;s Parenting a Free Child, An Unschooled Life. Then he read Stargirl. Since then, he can&#39;t seem to be without a book. He reads every day. On *his* terms. Because he wants to. Right now he&#39;s reading John Holt. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As hard as it was for me to accept that he needed to find it in his own time, it was just as sweet fo<br/>
r me to watch him become a bibliophile. &lt;g&gt; I&#39;m so glad I backed off of the reading and let him come to it in his own way, in his own time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2001146071">My son is 12 and although he can read, he doesn&#39;t seem to enjoy it as  much <br/>
as I do.  I love to read and would quite happily read all day, to the  <br/>
exclusion of many other things.  My son, not so much.  He enjoyed  graphic novels, <br/>
although he hasn&#39;t read any lately.  He reads magazines and  used to read comic <br/>
books.  I haven&#39;t bought any comics lately.  (Note  to self --- ask if he&#39;d <br/>
like any to take on the road)  His interests change  from time to time.  We have <br/>
lots of books around the house and he is free  to read any that he chooses.  <br/>
Some times I&#39;ll read something to him from a  book I&#39;m reading and he&#39;ll want <br/>
to hear more or he won&#39;t.  He came to me  recently and read to me from the game <br/>
informer magazine to point out an error  they made.  So, I know he can read.  <br/>
It&#39;s just that his choices aren&#39;t  the same as mine. I don&#39;t particularly <br/>
enjoy game informer magazine, but he  does.   <br/>
His older sister and I go to the library frequently.  He sometimes  chooses <br/>
to go and sometimes not.  If he does go he doesn&#39;t always get books  to bring <br/>
home.  I will bring home books that I think might  interest him.  Sometimes I&#39;m <br/>
right and sometimes not.  Once in a while  he isn&#39;t interested in reading, <br/>
but is interested in the book.  It gives us  a chance to sit together and read.  <br/>
lol, or rather, I read until I don&#39;t  have enough voice left.   <br/>
Some of the books that I like my daughter wouldn&#39;t enjoy.  That  doesn&#39;t mean <br/>
that at 24 she can&#39;t read or that her choices are wrong.  It  doesn&#39;t mean <br/>
that my choices are wrong.  It just means we have different  interests.  I would <br/>
think that it is okay for your son to avoid the  so-called real books.  <br/>
Graphic novels meet a need or fill an interest he  has.  He enjoys them.  When he <br/>
wants to read something different he  will.  <br/>

like Eyewitness books. I feel like he should be reading &quot;real&quot; books.  Is<br/>
it okay for him to avoid &quot;real&quot; books still? Should I encourage him more  to<br/>
read &quot;real&quot; books? My fear is that he will never move on from the  graphic<br/>
novels and such. I know I should be more trusting, but this is a hard  one<br/>
for me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Just a few sort of related thoughts, based on my own experience:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in the middle of reading Watchman - the most famous of all graphic <br/>
novels and about to be a movie. It is hard for me to read a graphic <br/>
novel - my eyes don&#39;t quite know how to do it. I lose concentration. I&#39;m <br/>
impressed by how my kids read graphic novels and get so much out of <br/>
them. I constantly have to go back and really look at the pictures, my <br/>
habit is to ignore  pictures and just read the words - missing a lot of <br/>
important stuff going on.<br/>
<br/>
My vision is not great and is getting worse, so a few years ago I <br/>
started listening to books, instead of reading them. When I started, I <br/>
hated it. I just couldn&#39;t pay attention and I&#39;d suddenly realize that <br/>
the book was playing in my ear but I hadn&#39;t heard it for 10 minutes. My <br/>
mind wandered. I persisted because someone else told me that they&#39;d had <br/>
trouble listening at the beginning and then grew to love it. I do too, <br/>
now. I&#39;ve listened to something around 200 books in the last few years.<br/>
<br/>
For about 20 years I barely read any fiction. I read nonfiction of all <br/>
kinds, but fiction just didn&#39;t appeal to me. Just in the last few years <br/>
has fiction again become the focus of my reading (or listening).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-358273816">Ooh V.C. Andrews Flowers in the Attic? I can remember reading that and a couple of the sequels in one night in the basement of my extended families&#39; friends who had taken us in after my grandfather&#39;s car caught on fire on our way to Wyoming to go fishing. Would those count as &quot;real&quot; books or live in the derisively thought of world of incestous romance novels? If you enjoy them does it matter whether they are Dickens or Walker or if they are V.C. Andrews or Alan Moore or Stan Lee? <br/>
<br/>
Humans are such wonderful specialists. We find our own niches, our own skills. And yet schools teach to those of us who are good at the academic skills, who are good at reading and writing and analyzing and regurgitating and who are good at math from a computational standpoint and later from a more artistic understanding of math. Schools do not reward those who are looking to fill the other many and wonderful niches that humans fill. So those who aren&#39;t academically minded are punished and made to feel less than or lazy or difficult or special needs and not embiggened. It is an awful thing. <br/>

I was labeled a slow reader in school. I had to go to a tutor in 3rd grade  <br/>
to catch up with the other kids. I never enjoyed reading and I didn&#39;t have the  <br/>
capacity to sit and read for more then a few minutes. My mind kept wandering <br/>
to  other things and I would have read the whole page and not remembered a <br/>
thing.  When I was in 8th grade (around 13) I read a VC Andrews book that <br/>
belonged to my  sister and I fell in love with reading. I couldn&#39;t get enough. I <br/>
loved that  there were more books with the same story, and I hated that the <br/>
stories would  eventually come to an end. (I still am that way...LOL) There was <br/>
nothing that  anyone could have done for me to prepare me to read &quot;books&quot;. My <br/>
parents tried  and my teachers tried but my mind was not yet ready. I love reading <br/>
today  thankfully but sometimes I feel like &quot;the stupid one in class&quot; even <br/>
though they  never told it to me but because I always needed extra help or <br/>
someone was  telling me I should be at this level. <br/>

whole life and nothing else quite filled the hole. Comics and science  <br/>
fiction and fantasy didn&#39;t have the depth of character I wanted. In  <br/>
fact, now that Kathryn&#39;s ready to move on, I&#39;m moving out the &quot;real&quot;  <br/>
books so there&#39;s plenty of room for the manga that&#39;s stacking up  <br/>
everywhere ;-)<br/>
<br/>
For years people have pointed out that some people learn better  <br/>
visually (by seeing something) and some people learn better by  <br/>
reading. It wasn&#39;t until recently that I realized I draw from both.  <br/>
Growing up I bet I never made it through a full article in National  <br/>
Geographic or Popular Science or Popular Mechanics. But I went  <br/>
through and looked at all the pictures and read the captions of the  <br/>
ones that interested me. (Even though I was a prolific reader. But  <br/>
what I read other people would have branded as fluff (science fiction  <br/>
and fantasy).)<br/>
<br/>
Science classes didn&#39;t feed my love of science. Nor did &quot;real&quot; books  <br/>
about science. Pictures and Nova and other science programs on TV and  <br/>
science fictions. Nothing that educators would have deemed real.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1401579963">This is a hard one to let go of especially if you are a prolific novel (fiction/non-fiction) reader yourself. My youngest brother barely read all the way through public school, now he reads everything he can get his hands on. My daughter started off with a love books and it died some where along the line in public school. Now, graphic novels she can&#39;t put down. I know she can read and read quite well. But she is happy and always has a book lying around that she is reading. I spent a little bit of time talking to our children&#39;s librarian. She and my daughter spent two separate days combing the library to find books that appealed to her. I honestly didn&#39;t care of it was just a picture book but I wanted her to find that love of books again. She loved it she and the librarian became really good friends, they talk about the books she reads and she asks the librarian for recommendations on different subjects. So I know she is reading but her fun relaxation<br/>
 reading is graphic novels. For her special interests she is finding a wealth of information in various sources and they don&#39;t have to be books. Videos, games, internet, they all require reading. So if it is not your typical story just know that they cannot get through the day without seeing words posted/printed some place. All books were created equal, some just appeal to different people more than others. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1415620253">First of all, thank you to everyone who answered my concerns.  I<br/>
really appreciate the support.  I am just learning to let go of all my<br/>
pre-conceived notions from being public-schooled myself and it helps<br/>
to have the support of others who are on this journey too.<br/>
<br/>
And Deb, I am so sorry if I have offended you.  I actually didn&#39;t say<br/>
anything specifically about young adult books.  I read those too and<br/>
love them.  I was actually including those in my statement &quot;real&quot;<br/>
books.  I guess I used the wrong term, I actually meant comic books<br/>
like Calvin and Hobbes and Astrix, not the more involved graphic<br/>
novels (I have no idea what terms go with what!).  I actually think<br/>
these are quite fun to read and enjoy them myself.  My concern was<br/>
that he may not move on from these and learn to enjoy other books as<br/>
well.  I have never said anything to him about disapproving of comic<br/>
books and we read them together all the time.  I encourage him to read<br/>
other things, but I don&#39;t push.<br/>
<br/>
Again, if I insulted you , I am deeply sorry.  That was not my intent.<br/>
 My intent was simply to get some advice on an issue I am struggling<br/>
with.  I understand that not everyone struggles with the same issues<br/>
and that we all have differing opinions.  I am relatively new to this<br/>
way of life and I am still adjusting and letting go.  Everyone is at<br/>
different places in their journey and this is were I am at right now.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-794125231">Calvin and Hobbes is amazing.  The name Hobbes is a reference to Thomas Hobbes and Calvin to John Calvin. It&#39;s a study in how those two world views play out, as well as many other things. Fantastically wonderful books. Read up on them. Start at Wikipedia: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_and_Hobbes.">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_and_Hobbes.</a> There are fantastic ideas in morality and empathy and snowman sculpture and time travel being played out in that strip. <br/>
<br/>
Simon loves Asterix and Obelix. The puns are great, the references, Cesar in every one. Have you seen the movies? See if you can get them in the U.S. There is even a live action one. See if your son would enjoy those. There is even an Asterix theme park in France that I really would love to take Simon to sometime. <br/>
<br/>
Linnaea really likes Pearls Before Swine. Maybe your son would enjoy some of the collections of that. I&#39;m sure there are more that are along the same lines. I like Jughead comics, we have a lot of those laying around. <br/>

dancing.  One of the things I love about him is that he hasn&#39;t outgrown his<br/>
love of Calvin & Hobbes; in fact, his relation to Calvin has helped his<br/>
understanding of unschooling!  He wishes Calvin&#39;s parents had been so<br/>
enlightened :D  Again, very real, not in any way not-real (I guess I&#39;m not<br/>
sure I understand what you mean with this distinction)<br/>

&gt; different places in their journey and this is were I am at right now.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One really important thing to let go of is that picture in your mind of what<br/>
*should be* -- those thoughts are blocking your ability to embrace *what is*<br/>
right in front of you.<br/>
<br/>
This time of year is really, really tough for me... this week included the<br/>
3rd anniversary of my daughter&#39;s death AND the 1st anniversary of the death<br/>
of a very cool unschooling mama. It is the reality in my life that Life is<br/>
Short and every single second counts!  If your son got hit by a bus tomorrow<br/>
(sorry for the macbre example) would you rather he die: feeling he<br/>
disappointed his mother for liking the *wrong* things or feeling completely<br/>
loved and accepted for who he is, exacty where he is??  Truly, the choice is<br/>
yours, right here, right now in every single moment there&#39;s a chance to do<br/>
better, to listen more, to accept wholly... Better there be no regrets in<br/>
your relationship + gaps in education than no regrets about arbitrary<br/>
*shoulds* + insurmountable gaps in your relationship.<br/>
<br/>
Please forgive what may seem harsh advice and try on the urgency I feel is<br/>
at the heart of unschooling - our time (even without young death) with our<br/>
children is *so* short on the scope of Life, what we make of it matters<br/>
deeply.<br/>

~[to Hayden from me] Hey! Did you know World of Warcraft has books!! Let&#39;s<br/>
get this trilogy!<br/>
~[to Hayden from me] If you get bored while we&#39;re doing X, I have Artemis<br/>
Fowl, Harry Potter and Unfortunate Events on the MP3 for ya.<br/>
~[from Scotty to me VERY EXCITED]OMG I just got this cool Dune installment,<br/>
written by the son after the dad died, and I think you&#39;ll love it!! There<br/>
are descriptions of the palace and your favorite character is explained in<br/>
more detail...<br/>
~[me, in general] I&#39;m listening to Sohie&#39;s World this week while I walk the<br/>
dog, I am really liking it, if you want a great explanation of philosophy<br/>
through the ages, this book is really cool.<br/>
<br/>
I also tend to blather on about whatever it is I&#39;m listening to at the<br/>
moment, because while I&#39;m listening I generally only have the dog as company<br/>
:) I&#39;m pretty excited at the moment because I put HP1 on the MP3 and<br/>
listened to it for the 114th time and decided to find it in Spanish!! So<br/>
far, I can only catch the names - and not all of those because of the<br/>
pronunciation difference :-/<br/>
<br/>
As someone who really relishes the tactile experience of a book, I found the<br/>
learning curve of listening pretty steep in the beginning.  The more I walk<br/>
the dog and knit easy projects, the easier it is to listen to books.  The<br/>
more I&#39;m interested in books that interest me and the more interesting I<br/>
become in sharing what I come away with, the more interesting books become<br/>
to those around me.<br/>
I listened to Dune for the first time last year, only because it&#39;s Scotty&#39;s<br/>
favorite and he was *so* passionate it was contagious!  Be contagious!<br/>
<br/>
There is a very, very delicious novelization of V for Vendetta available in<br/>
audio...<br/>
(a graphic novel, turned movie, turned novel... tough to place on the *real*<br/>
scale :::vbeg:::)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-621759102">~~My concern was that he may not move on from these and learn to enjoy<br/>
other books as well.~~<br/>
<br/>
I understand this. When my oldest (now 16) was younger, he did not<br/>
spend a lot of time reading. I had a hard time accepting that! Books<br/>
were such a HUGE part of my life - it&#39;s how I survived my childhood,<br/>
really, and I still love to read today. *How* could he not LOVE to<br/>
read?! Someone said something on a list back then that helped me see<br/>
it differently. They said, &quot;In your childhood, you read to escape.<br/>
Your son doesn&#39;t have this need to escape.&quot; At the time, it opened my<br/>
eyes! Oh! He is NOT ME. Go figure! Now, there are some nit-picky<br/>
things I could say about that, but at the time, it helped me move<br/>
toward acceptance of his not-reading-voraciously.<br/>
<br/>
One other time I got a *little* stuck with the reading thing was when<br/>
I got a set of World Book Encyclopedias. Ah! The boys were going to<br/>
LOVE them, there&#39;s a whole WORLD in those books, with information, and<br/>
pictures... I used to read our (my childhood family) set of<br/>
encyclopedias, each book, cover to cover when I was little. (I&#39;m a<br/>
nerd, I used to also read the dictionary!) I used to spend *hours*<br/>
poring over the pictures, the different breeds of dogs, the clear<br/>
plastic human body pages, that layered. Yes, it was going to be<br/>
*bliss* at our house when I brought this set of books in. Except.<br/>
Except the boys never read them. Ever. When they asked something, I&#39;d<br/>
look it up in the encyclopedias when appropriate, and they&#39;d glance at<br/>
it, nothing more. {sigh} I had them for four years, before I asked the<br/>
boys if they minded if I offered them on freecycle. (I wasn&#39;t reading<br/>
them, either!) They didn&#39;t mind a bit.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard when I loved something SO much, it used to make me feel like<br/>
the boys were missing out on this wonderful thing! But they have their<br/>
OWN things they love, Calvin & Hobbes among those, their OWN things<br/>
that bring them joy, that they return to again and again. My things<br/>
don&#39;t have to be their things. They are not missing a *thing*.<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>

there&#39;s no voice tone that goes with it. Which means sometimes we  <br/>
suply the wrong tone in our minds when we read.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why it&#39;s often suggested that if words sound harsh to reread  <br/>
them with the gentle tone of voice of your best friend who is trying  <br/>
to help you.<br/>
<br/>
Hers was a legitimate question to make you stop and think about the  <br/>
subject of YA books from a different direction: &quot;Hmm so should I, at  <br/>
48, NOT be reading books from the &quot;young adult&quot; section of the library?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I read young adult book science fiction and fantasy long after being  <br/>
a young adult because the characters were, at the time, more fully  <br/>
formed.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a quote from Madeline L&#39;Engle who wrote my favorite book  <br/>
growing up, Wrinkle in Time: &quot;You have to write the book that wants  <br/>
to be written. And if the book will be too difficult for grown-ups,  <br/>
then you write it for children.&quot;<br/>

Thanks for this Diana, god I love your posts.  I got all teary when I read it&#39;s the anniversary of Hannah.  I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ve said, but your posts about this topic are one of the big-time influences that shifted me into being totally in love with my girls...and treasuring every moment, even if sometimes that particular moment happens to kind of suck :).  It&#39;s during the moments that suck that I usually remember Hannah...and you...and how short your time was together...and then I give them a huge hug and whatever sucked no longer matters.  <br/>
 <br/>
Big hugs and much love and light to you this week.  My vision is still my girls and I being able to party with y&#39;all at Life Is Good!!!<br/>

the same experience - steep learning curve in getting started listening <br/>
to audible books.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve listened to over 300 audible books - and I now have favorite <br/>
narrators. Sometimes I listen to a book that I&#39;d probably never pick up <br/>
and read, because I like the narrator so much. I&#39;ve discovered some good <br/>
stuff that I&#39;d have otherwise ignored.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1365449212">Nope, I wasn&#39;t insulted - my comment was specifically designed to draw<br/>
out (in your mind) what exactly you meant by &#39;real&#39; books - because you<br/>
seemed to be putting an &#39;age appropriate&#39; tag on what materials your<br/>
child &#39;should&#39; be reading.<br/>
<br/>
Calvin and Hobbs is awesome! Have you read them? Do you catch all the<br/>
literary and cultural references in there? Have you asked which ones are<br/>
favorites and why?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My concern was that he may not move on from these and learn to enjoy<br/>
 </span></blockquote>other books as well.<br/>
Why is it necessary to &quot;move on&quot; from those? The vet we take our dog to<br/>
mentioned once that he rarely reads fiction at all - mostly he reads<br/>
informational/professional materials and the occasional biography (like<br/>
the recent John Adams and Ben Franklin biographies). Should he &quot;move on&quot;<br/>
to learn to enjoy other books as well? The fact is, some people ONLY<br/>
read for information and don&#39;t read as entertainment. Reading is a tool,<br/>
just like a hammer. If I really enjoy making bird houses, and I make<br/>
them for friends and family and maybe sell them at craft fairs, should I<br/>
&quot;move on&quot; to making tables and not &quot;just&quot; make bird houses because I&#39;m<br/>
not expanding how I use my hammer? Sounds silly put that way, doesn&#39;t<br/>
it? :-) But it&#39;s a true analogy - reading is not an end in itself<br/>
(though school makes us think it is); it is one among MANY tools for<br/>
gathering information about the world around us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1050452583">We were just discussing books last night on the way in to Starbucks<br/>
because DS had his current book (Bionicle Chronicles I think it is, he<br/>
finished the Bionicle Legends series a week or two ago). But, there are<br/>
only 3 chapters left in this book. We&#39;ve pulled out a few things we<br/>
already own that he might enjoy next - DH has a bunch of novelizations<br/>
of Star Trek episodes (with photos of scenes and everything) and we&#39;ve<br/>
got a few other things he might like (some Star Wars &quot;junior&quot; novels as<br/>
well as some full size fat novels). I mentioned that if we go to the<br/>
library, he can &#39;try out&#39; a few different books and if he doesn&#39;t like<br/>
them we just take them right back. Plus, the children&#39;s librarian might<br/>
be able to point us at similar stuff &quot;If you liked this, you might like<br/>
that&quot; (kind of like video stores and Amazon do). Odds are we&#39;ll be<br/>
hitting the library this weekend or early next week (depending on how<br/>
bad the impending nor&#39;easter is - it&#39;s going to be partly sunny and mid<br/>
50s today and a nor&#39;easter starting Sunday and potentially lasting until<br/>
Tuesday - go figure! Ah, New England in the springtime-ish).<br/>
