<div id="ygrps-yiv-226159176">HOW on earth does one kind of media claim responsibilty for making<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; kids &quot;bounce off the walls&quot; AND &quot;comatose&quot;???<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sounds like Ritalin to me...<br/>
<br/>
****<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of Ritalin, I saw an article in the paper today that they&#39;ve done study -- admittedly small -- in which the results incidate an increased risk of cancers in kids who take ritalin.  <br/>
<br/>
Apparently the study found that after only 3 months, every one of a dozen children (so 8.5%) treated with Ritalin had a three-fold increase in chromosome abnormalities associated with increased risks of cancer.  <br/>
<br/>
Given the small sample of kids tested, Marvin Legator an environmental toxicologist and principal investigator in the studay said, &quot;This should raise a red flag.  There&#39;s no question we need a bigger study before we can take any further major action.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Doctors have been prescribing Ritalin for some 50 years, with schools advocating handing it out like candy to any kid how can&#39;t sit perfectly still for 7 hrs, and no one bothered to see if it altered chromosomes? <br/>
<br/>
Final paragraph of the article:<br/>
<br/>
But medical experts said that, until more is known, parents should not be overly frightened of giving the drug to their children.  &quot;Cancer is somethign to be scared about but untreated ADHD is devastating, too,&quot;  said Kathryn Ellerbeck, a developmental pediatrician at the University of Kanses Medical Center. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;End of quote&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So now untreated ADHD is at least as devastating and frightening as cancer?!   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-629542510">The article I read in my local paper was from Knight Ridder Newspapers.  <br/>
 <br/>
I just ran a google on &#39;ritalin cancer risk&#39; and had several hits.  Here&#39;s one addy for a site at medicine net:<br/>
 <br/>
www.medicinenet.com/script/ main/art.asp?articlekey=43760<br/>
 <br/>
It sounds like the &#39;experts&#39; are saying there&#39;s no cause for concern. Then again, the person who asserted that untreated ADHD is &#39;devastating&#39; -- and implied that it could somehow be as bad as an increased cancer risk is one of those experts.  When did ADHD become as bad as cancer?  I mean, does ADHD actually kill people?  <br/>
