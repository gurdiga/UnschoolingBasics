I have said,  &quot; I think Annie needs your help,&quot;  to a mom who&#39;s kid was <br/>
hurting another kid.  Or &quot;I think Brady needs you.&quot;<br/>
Really, I think some mom&#39;s just don&#39;t know what to do and I think they sort <br/>
of believe that kind of thing is inevitable and everyone expects it so they <br/>
don&#39;t take action.<br/>
<br/>
Take action and encourage them to do so too and maybe that will give them <br/>
new tools.<br/>
<br/>
It has less to do with unschooling than it has to do with the social skills <br/>
of the mom.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That has been effective at our homeschool group at getting moms up  <br/>
off their chairs and over closer to kids when needed, too.<br/>
<br/>
I have also just described the situation to a mom: &quot;Eric seems  <br/>
frustrated because he thinks Austen isn&#39;t giving him turns with the  <br/>
ball. What should we do?&quot; or &quot;Carl keeps taking the blocks away from  <br/>
Moby, and now Moby is whacking him. What should we do?&quot; Then all of a  <br/>
sudden we two moms (who might have been sitting there quietly fuming  <br/>
and picking sides in our kids&#39; conflict) are allies trying to make  <br/>
things better for the kids.<br/>
