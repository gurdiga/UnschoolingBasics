<div id="ygrps-yiv-439095411">Tina, you can check out her book online too<br/>
<br/>
www.wishcraft.com<br/>
<br/>
it&#39;s in ebook format. I cannot even begin to explain how much this book has helped me in the past few weeks, Jason was smiling this morning! A true unforced smile, he hasn&#39;t yelled in a few days, he&#39;s remembering to breath and he&#39;s playing again.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know where we are going yet, but I&#39;m starting to understand what it feels like to be happy, truely happy...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-235217210">Wow, thanks for recommending this.  I checked it out from the library and I<br/>
can barely put it down.  It is so full of amazing insight and information<br/>
that can help both me as a person with my own wishes and help me help my<br/>
children.  WOW.<br/>
