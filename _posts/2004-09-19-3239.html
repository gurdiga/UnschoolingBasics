<div id="ygrps-yiv-1908096119">Hello All!<br/>
<br/>
Robyn Coburn and I would like to announce the formation of a new yahoo <br/>
group--Always Unschooled--for the discussion of Radical Unschooling in <br/>
the Early Years. Go to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysUnschooled/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysUnschooled/</a> <br/>
to join. This is a place to talk about all those toddler issues and <br/>
unschooling your pre-school aged children whether you have older <br/>
unschooled children or are just starting your unschooling journey. Below <br/>
is the list description:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Are you Unschooling small children? Do you find yourself ducking <br/>
questions about when your kids will start preschool, kindergarten or <br/>
telling people that you&#39;ve already made the commitment to homeschool? <br/>
Come join us for a discussion of Unschooling in the early years!<br/>
<br/>
As Unschooling becomes more widespread, the deliberate choice to <br/>
Unschool comes early as a way to fend off pressure for Head-Start, <br/>
Preschool and Pre-K<br/>
programs. Many mothers are emphatically resisting the push toward early <br/>
academics and choosing, instead to nurture freedom, joy, childhood and <br/>
natural learning, trusting that their children will learn all they <br/>
genuinely need to know-- the very foundations of Unschooling!<br/>
<br/>
List owners are working to create a space in which Radical Unschooling <br/>
can be seriously discussed as it applies to young children. Although <br/>
secular in nature, we welcome unschoolers from all walks of life. Our <br/>
discussions focus on exploring topics like natural learning, respectful <br/>
parenting, joyful living, freedom and autonomy, living by principles, <br/>
single parent unschooling, convincing family, surviving panic and <br/>
criticism, living without fear, resisting enrollment, non-coercive <br/>
parenting, deschooling ourselves, and letting go of controls.<br/>
<br/>
This is an on-topic list specifically dedicated to achieving a deeper <br/>
understanding of a Radical Unschooling lifestyle as it applies to young <br/>
children--topics that fall outside this description belong, please, on <br/>
more appropriate lists. This list is geared towards thoughtful <br/>
discussion and exploration of what Radical Unschooling looks like in the <br/>
early years, from toddlerhood to around age 8 or so. Experienced and new <br/>
Unschoolers can discuss how they made the transition from peaceful <br/>
parenting to Unschooling in daily practice, when that transition <br/>
occurred and what benefits children gain by Unschooling from the <br/>
beginning. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re very excited about creating a space where we can seriously discuss <br/>
Unschooling small children and the many, many benefits children gain <br/>
from being Always Unschooled. We hope you&#39;ll join us!<br/>
