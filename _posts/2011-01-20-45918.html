<div id="ygrps-yiv-1720642942">Hello,<br/>
I&#39;d love to get some feedback on a situation that I have.  We have unschooled from the beginning but until about 2 years ago didn&#39;t really know it had a name. I&#39;m comfortable in our unschooling approach except in one area that a flounder around in.  My daughter is 7 and is legally blind. She has enough vision to see extremely large print but we assume braille will be her primary reading means.  She has expressed an interest in learning to read because her 5 year old brother is a fluent reader and she sees how it allows him to be more independent in playing on the wii and the computer. We discussed with her the avenues she has to learning to read, both print and braille. She would like to learn both. She is struggling to pick up reading print but I&#39;m not concerned about it. I know that 7 is still very young and she has some other issues (learning differences and speech issues) that may make reading print more challenging. Braille she has picked up on very quickly and is making great progress with. But she struggling with tactile discrimination, which is needed to actually read a braille cell.  The problem is that recently her interest in putting the time and energy towards learning Braille has diminished. Part of me is fine with this. The other part struggles with letting it go. Braille is not one of those things she is just going to stumble onto learning. Though we have lots of braille books and braille labels on household stuff, I don&#39;t believe it is enough for her to become even functionally literate by mere exposure, like one can do with print.  Typically she will ask what we can do on any given day and I always just threw in that we could look at learning some more braille and typically she&#39;d be interested. But about 2 months ago, the interest started to decline and I started gently pushing her to do it.  Adding it before or after something that she really wanted to do.  This isn&#39;t sitting right with me. I don&#39;t want to be pushing it but I have concerns over the &quot;what if she never wants to learn it&quot;.  She listens to audio stories all day and has a screen reader for the computer. I can easily slip into the mindset that she will never be &quot;motivated&quot; to do it learn it on her own.  But in this age of technology, is being literate in a format that is not easily accessible (Braille) even important?  I&#39;m just struggling to figure out how to fit braille into unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-744364467">As list owner, I have removed the last few posts about the list. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The list is the list. It has helped hundreds/thousands of people over the years to better understand unschooling. If it does not fit you or your learning style, please feel free to check elsewhere. You can even start your own list if you think you can do better. Or stay and answer in the way that you think others can understand best.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The list exists to discuss unschooling, NOT the list itself. That&#39;s silly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All posts which continue to discuss the list will be deleted. All unmoderated posters who continue to discuss the list will be put on moderation until I&#39;m satisfied that it won&#39;t be *the* topic of conversation.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So...back to your regularly scheduled unschooling discussons.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you very much.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-409635655">I had a blind friend in college who could make his tape recorder speed up...a LOT...so that he could &quot;read&quot; faster. That was really, really cool. All we heard was &quot;bleelesauherrthgreooople,&quot; but he heard a real sentence---so fascinating! He&#39;d just sped up the tape player gradually until he could &quot;speed read. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My son left school at the end of sixth grade and told me that he would never read or write again. He didn&#39;t until he was 18. His first book was Rue Kream&#39;s Parenting a Free Child, An Unschooled Life. Now, he *was* reading and writing (mostly online), but it didn&#39;t look like *school* reading and writing. I *could* have made him, pushed him, gently guided him to read; but I knew he would read and write when he was ready. He did.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think your daughter will learn Braille when and if she decides it&#39;s important. Keep plenty of Braille in her environment, just in case. But the blind have sooo many options in our techno world! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We raised several guide dogs over the last few years. I remember hearing that fewer and fewer people are learning/using Braille because of so many other options. But still---if she didn&#39;t learn it until her 20s, she could still learn it then!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be patient and fill her world with Braille so that it&#39;s available if she wants it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1855673004">My mom has been legally blind since she was a child.  Juvenile Macular Degeneration and Stargardt&#39;s Disease.  She does not know braille or have a guide dog.  She gets around OK, but cannot drive.  She *can* read but generally doesn&#39;t until she needs to, in other words doesn&#39;t read for pleasure.  She&#39;s always been OK with that.  There *are* tons of options out there.  She also works for the an organization for blind and visually impaired people.  She has zoom text on her computer.  I have NO IDEA how she can use it.  It&#39;s whacky!  But it&#39;s what she knows and she uses it well.  She lives a pretty darn good life, despite her disability.  :)  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-588702357">Ok, I&#39;m new here and have just been reading so far. However, I think I&#39;ll jump in here. I can&#39;t really speak to how to handle your situation as far as unschooling goes, but I can answer some of the braille questions. I happen to be the legally, almost totally, blind mother of a sighted daughter. I&#39;d be happy to chat with you either on or off list about some ideas for working on the tactile part of braille fun. I&#39;d also be more than willing to talk with your daughter if she&#39;d like. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know exactly where in the process you are, but one thing that can be kind of fun is to use a peg board to create the braille letters. I think we used golf tees when I was little. Also, you can use different materials to make bigger dots to start with. My grandmother used to write me messages in puff paint. Even things like outlining a coloring page in glue so that it has a raised line and she can feel rather than see where to color can help with tactile recognition. <br/>
<br/>
Hope that gives you a starting point. If you&#39;d like to contact me off list, please feel free. <br/>

I understand her frustration and terror because I am new at this as well. My<br/>
first thought as a newbie for this child is.how is she going to function as<br/>
a blind adult if she can&#39;t at least read through the use of Braille? I am<br/>
constantly asking myself this question for my sighted children and how they<br/>
are going to function without the traditional education that I received. I<br/>
feel like a horrible mother sometimes because I am letting them just sit and<br/>
vegetate most of the day in front of the TV. I ask myself, &quot;shouldn&#39;t they<br/>
be *doing* something?&quot; then the old me comes out and answers, &quot;YES&quot; and I<br/>
insist they go clean their rooms or do the dishes or take out the trash.or<br/>
PICK UP A BOOK AND READ IT. it is all about my fear of them growing into<br/>
lazy or uneducated adults..and I am not sure how to resolve it. So I<br/>
understand your question but it terrifies the crap out of me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What else are you offering?<br/>
<br/>
Are they choosing TV out of many other things that *they* find  <br/>
engaging? And not just stuff in the house they could be doing on their  <br/>
own or with each other, but their primary opportunity should be time  <br/>
with you.<br/>
<br/>
If my choice was TV or cleaning my room, I&#39;d watch TV.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s nothing wrong with watching TV, or reading a book, or playing  <br/>
outside if, from a life *they* feel is rich with choices, that&#39;s what  <br/>
they choose to do. But if TV (or a book or outside) is the best of a  <br/>
bunch of &quot;eh&quot; things, then it&#39;s not much of a choice.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t about letting them loose to find their way! It&#39;s  <br/>
about helping them explore the world. It&#39;s about you being excited  <br/>
about the world :-) If even with opportunities to go to a new park,  <br/>
explore a thrift store, go to the zoo, visit friends, paint, bake,  <br/>
plant a garden, dig holes in the back yard and so on, they&#39;d really  <br/>
rather watch TV, then watch TV with them. *Be* with them. Find out  <br/>
more about what they love. Get stuff that ties into the programs they  <br/>
love. Look stuff up on the internet.<br/>
<br/>
Engage with them. Be their partner in their explorations of the world.  <br/>
Be the power to get things they can&#39;t get. Be the greater knowledge of  <br/>
the world that can run interesting things through their lives.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a good page with loads of links:<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you&#39;d like for them to never clean their rooms, never offer to take  <br/>
out the trash with a smile, and never read for pleasure, this would be  <br/>
a very good way to go about it!<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t read that as a reprimand, but really think about why that might  <br/>
be true. If your husband got upset with you for not living your life  <br/>
the way he was picturing you should be, and told you to go clean your  <br/>
room, would you feel more like living your life to his expectations or  <br/>
like cleaning your room? If you even later had the desire to clean  <br/>
your room, wouldn&#39;t those images of his anger and need to control you  <br/>
come back and discolor that desire?<br/>

Chores in the case of those pages is sort of a lens to see unschooling  <br/>
and building relationships through.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-479852085">Speaking from personal experience as a fluent braille reader, it isn&#39;t all that useful in everyday life. There is even a devision of thought among blind and visually impaired individuals about whether or not braille is a necessary skill. With the advancement of the internet and everything that is now available electronically, it sometimes makes much more sense to be extremely comfortable with the use of a screen reader and accessing all kinds of information online. <br/>
<br/>
Having said that, for me personally, there is not a substitute for being able to pick up a book and actually, physically read it. There is something to be said for being able to give your own voice and insights to characters. This becomes more difficult, at least for me, when listening to an audio book or reading online through the robotic voice of a screen reader. <br/>
<br/>
So, I guess the short answer to the question about why does she need to learn braille is that she doesn&#39;t. I think it&#39;s a personal preference, but it isn&#39;t something that I would push if she&#39;s not interested. If she learns it eventually, then that&#39;s just one more skill she&#39;ll have; but if she doesn&#39;t, she&#39;ll have plenty of other ways to access information that can be just as effective and fulfilling.<br/>

&gt;I understand her frustration and terror because I am new at this as well. My<br/>
&gt;first thought as a newbie for this child is.how is she going to function as<br/>
&gt;a blind adult if she can&#39;t at least read through the use of Braille? I am<br/>
&gt;constantly asking myself this question for my sighted children and how they<br/>
&gt;are going to function without the traditional education that I received. I<br/>
&gt;feel like a horrible mother sometimes because I am letting them just sit and<br/>
&gt;vegetate most of the day in front of the TV. I ask myself, &quot;shouldn&#39;t they<br/>
&gt;be *doing* something?&quot; then the old me comes out and answers, &quot;YES&quot; and I<br/>
&gt;insist they go clean their rooms or do the dishes or take out the trash.or<br/>
&gt;PICK UP A BOOK AND READ IT. it is all about my fear of them growing into<br/>
&gt;lazy or uneducated adults..and I am not sure how to resolve it. So I<br/>
&gt;understand your question but it terrifies the crap out of me.<br/>

<br/>
But just like reading visually, braille can be (and is) learned by adults. There&#39;s no rush. In fact, every day she&#39;s learning more and more about literacy - through tv, games, listening to stories, dramatic play, signs, conversation.... Learning about literacy in a general sense will help her learn to read - correction! Is Helping Her learn to read, right now, with no &quot;extra&quot; effort. <br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s looking for more independence, it might be more helpful to her to looking into Other resources such as audio books. That would let her be more independent *and* learn more about literacy and literature in a general sense. Audio books are getting cheaper, and there are more and more available all the time!<br/>
<br/>
It may also be a good idea to check out what other resources exist for blind adults. Can you hire a reader for her? Maybe a teen or older child looking for some extra pocket money? I honestly don&#39;t know what other solutions visually impared folks come up with but think from the perspective of adult problem solving rather than focusing on what she might have to learn because it might be valuable to her later, if you see what I mean? ;)<br/>

<br/>
Absolutely understood. I apologize if I overstepped my bounds.  I know that the original poster had expressed concerns about feeling the need to push the braille issue, and since I think it&#39;s a particular subject that might not be a concern for the majority of unschooling parents, or parents in general, I thought I&#39;d offer my experiences. I&#39;m sure, of course, that many others have comparable issues and have been acquainted with unschooling for a longer period of time than I and will be able to offer much better thoughts. I just wanted to make the point that, strictly speaking, it isn&#39;t absolutely necessary that a blind child learn braille.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, <br/>

<br/>
The way schools teach sets you up for that kind of thinking - it seems to take years and years to learn things because soooooooo much time at school is spent going over things in tiny increments, and then reviewing what has been taught. Its a terribly inefficient way for people to actually learn things. <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a list of principles of natural learning here, which may help:<br/>

And a page of links to blogs by all sorts of unschoolers (moms, dads and kids, too!) so you can wrap your mind around how kids learn - or at least reassure yourself that they do learn, without being taught:<br/>

&gt; Speaking from personal experience as a fluent braille reader, it isn&#39;t all that useful in everyday life. There is even a devision of thought among blind and visually impaired individuals about whether or not braille is a necessary skill. With the advancement of the internet and everything that is now available electronically, it sometimes makes much more sense to be extremely comfortable with the use of a screen reader and accessing all kinds of information online. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Having said that, for me personally, there is not a substitute for being able to pick up a book and actually, physically read it. There is something to be said for being able to give your own voice and insights to characters. This becomes more difficult, at least for me, when listening to an audio book or reading online through the robotic voice of a screen reader. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, I guess the short answer to the question about why does she need to learn braille is that she doesn&#39;t. I think it&#39;s a personal preference, but it isn&#39;t something that I would push if she&#39;s not interested. If she learns it eventually, then that&#39;s just one more skill she&#39;ll have; but if she doesn&#39;t, she&#39;ll have plenty of other ways to access information that can be just as effective and fulfilling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1633986276">A screen reader is a software program which allows users to access the computer via text to speech. Basically, the program reads text on the computer screen. Users with visual disabilities, or anyone else, can navigate web sites, send and receive email, use a word processor, and perform most other functions that a sighted person does on a computer.<br/>
