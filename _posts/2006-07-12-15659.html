Do you feel you *need* Lifepacs-anything? Do you not think math and <br/>
health info are available in the real world? Why not?<br/>

Yikes! Is a bath more important than your relationship? Why is he <br/>
choosing not to bathe?<br/>

I&#39;m sorry it seems so bad right now, but these aren&#39;t unschooling <br/>
issues. Can you manage a couselor? Have the local electric company come <br/>
in and tell you what you can do to lower your bill? (ours does that) <br/>
Why do you need a better car when you can&#39;t drive? How many/what ages <br/>
are your children? Are you interestied in unschooling? Why?<br/>

  School&#39;s goal is to prepare them to be anything they want. But the  <br/>
process is so dullifying and kids haven&#39;t explored the possibilities  <br/>
of what they could be that many set their sites as low as possible.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-745048159">Kelly, you stated that you thought this was not an &quot;unschooling issue,&quot; <br/>
but I disagree.  The very thoughts and feelings that have been <br/>
described by this mother is what drives many to throw up their hands in <br/>
frustration and to ultimately discover there is a better way -- <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like this mother is very tired and frustrated, and most - if <br/>
not all - homeschoolers (and unschoolers) have had days or periods of <br/>
time where they felt this way, worked through that period, and come out <br/>
on the other side.  Maybe some could empathize and offer positive input <br/>
on how they coped.  <br/>
<br/>
Granted, there may be some bigger issues that need to be dealt with, <br/>
but since &quot;unschooling&quot; in general is learning from every aspect of our <br/>
lives and making it better, to say this isn&#39;t and &quot;unschooling issue&quot; <br/>
seems untrue to me.<br/>

  there is so much out there on teaching a child to read.  i let my 5 <br/>
year old pick his reading workbooks his choice to use workbooks not <br/>
mine.  he wanted to have &quot;home work&quot; like the big kids.<br/>
  the older 3 have lifepacs math but that is all everything else is <br/>

did get some health lifepacs so they could have something in front of <br/>
them mostly to make sure i dont forget anything.  :)  <br/>
<br/>
*** Ack!  Burn the lifepacs!!! No, seriously.  Ok, maybe not, they are<br/>
probably expensive.  But I was homeschooled, and I had to use lifepacs for a<br/>
year or two, and they were horrible, awful, my worst memories!  My brother<br/>
has the same feeling about them.  They are dry, boring workbooks.  Awful.<br/>
There are so many better ways to learn about mathematics in the world!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
my oldest has to <br/>
be threatened with grounding from the xbox and mo-ped to get him to <br/>
bathe.  :)<br/>
<br/>
*** How old is he?  How often are you making him bathe?  That sounds a<br/>
little strange.<br/>
<br/>
  i dont feel like i am in my happy place right now.  i know what i <br/>
want but i also know it wont happen now.  i am very impatient and <br/>

<br/>
*** It sounds like you realize that what you are doing is not working.  I&#39;d<br/>
start with burning the lifepacs ;)<br/>
<br/>
Have you looked into medication for your anxiety?  Sometimes it can be<br/>
life-changing if there is a chemical imbalance or something.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when I get stuck thinking about how to organize my<br/>
life/money/whatever, the best thing to do is take a deep breath and just<br/>
live *that day* as best I can.  I can waste lots of precious time obsessing<br/>
about the best way to do such-and-such or the best way to budget<br/>
such-and-such, but just taking one day at a time and prioritizing that day<br/>
in a meaningful way can lead to lots of contentment!!  Stop reading and<br/>
planning and start living!  That&#39;s what I do when I feel overwhelmed.<br/>

I used the advice to schedule one hour a week to worry, (for me 10am<br/>
on Mondays), and if I started worrying about money at any other time I<br/>
would remind myself to save it for the official worrying time on<br/>
Monday morning.  Then if I remembered to worry at the right time on<br/>
Monday, I would try to channel the worry into constructive things I<br/>
could do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1446764209">Others have responded so thoughtfully and with such calming perspective to the other <br/>
areas of this post, so I only wanted to add:<br/>
<br/>
In response to: &quot; there is so much out there on teaching a child to read.  i let my 5 <br/>

 mine.  he wanted to have &quot;home work&quot; like the big kids.&quot;<br/>

Have you tried reading rods? They are cubes that have the letters (capital and lowercase) of <br/>
the alphabet on them; the consonants are blue cubes, the vowels in red and a white &quot;silent <br/>
e&quot;.  They come with a set of ten books; each focuses on the long or short vowel sound and <br/>
highlights it in the words for a visual cue. For some reason these really made sense, <br/>
especially with the rods. Whenever we got stuck on a word, physically being able to <br/>
manipulate the cubes seemed to make something click. (And they&#39;re so much fun to play <br/>
with: they&#39;ve found many other uses like becoming a measuring stick, making up words <br/>
(great for emerging spellers), our 2-year old loves them for the put-together, take-apart <br/>
feature and early letter recognition type games, etc.) These are the only reading <br/>
&quot;materials&quot; we ever used (available at age four, not pushed, used only when chosen -which <br/>
wasn&#39;t really a whole lot) with our 5 year old, who can read independently.<br/>
<br/>
We are avid readers in our house, so he is surrounded by books and often catches us <br/>
reading whenever we get the chance. This has seemed to be a greater motivator than I <br/>
initially thought or expected. We recently created a reading nook in a closet so that he can <br/>
have a private space to indulge in reading. That your 5 year old is already eager to learn to <br/>
read is all that you really need. Take every opportunity to honor reading and to honor the <br/>
child&#39;s emerging reading abilities and the rest will fall into place in its own time at its own <br/>
pace.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In this day of computers, video games, and the obscene amount of<br/>
advertisement that we encounter each day I can&#39;t figure out how a<br/>
child *can&#39;t* learn to read eventually.  Your child is only choosing<br/>
workbooks because he is mimicking what he is seeing being done.  If<br/>
you were to sit and read books he would mimic that as well.  If the<br/>
older children were hanging out of trees like monkeys he would be<br/>
doing the same.  He isn&#39;t choosing to read because he wants to have<br/>
workbooks.  He is choosing workbooks because that is the pattern that<br/>
he sees in the older members of the house.  He doesn&#39;t understand that<br/>
there is another choice.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How old is this child and how often are you requiring him to bathe?<br/>
My son isn&#39;t much interested in bathing often, yet because it isn&#39;t an<br/>
issue he doesn&#39;t have to be threatened or coerced to bathe when he<br/>
gets smelly or dirt encrusted (please note that he rarely is dirt<br/>
encrusted :-) )  Usually a simple reminder that the rest of the family<br/>
would appreciate note smelling his body odors is enough for him to<br/>
find a time to bathe.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>OK, I&#39;m going to go be thankful for my $230 electric bill.  And I&quot;m<br/>
going to stop preaching about turning out the lights all the time and<br/>
just do it when I see an unecessary light on.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;i need my own life and they need me to have one.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Can&#39;t you have a life together?  If you feel like you need some &quot;alone<br/>
time&quot; then find a way to make that happen. Perhaps an early morning<br/>
walk around the neighborhood (which is a great remedy for stress to<br/>
boot), or have a girlfriend come pick you up and go out for a lunch or<br/>
just to have a cup of tea at her house.  Find out what your bus routes<br/>
are and what kind of bus passes are available.  If the electric bill<br/>
is overwhelming call the electric company before it becomes past due<br/>
and see if they have an assistance program or can come do a home<br/>
inspection to see how you can reduce (for not much money) your<br/>
electric waste (sealing doors and windows, using compact flourescent<br/>
bulbs, changing the temperature on your hot water heater for maximum<br/>
efficiency, what temperature to set your a/c on so that it runs less<br/>
and you get cooling power better during that time, etc etc etc)  These<br/>
are usually free and sometimes they even have specials that if you<br/>
purchase the recommended things from them you get a deep discount<br/>
(like caulking for windows and foam insulation around doors).<br/>
