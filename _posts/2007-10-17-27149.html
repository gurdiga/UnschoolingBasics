<div id="ygrps-yiv-359235291">My son has sported a mohawk since he was 10, he is now 15.  We dye it different colors and try out different patterns.  He loves it, and it gives us one more thing to bond over.  My mom was the same way, and my response is &quot;It&#39;s only hair!&quot;  If my child is kind, considerate, works hard and doesn&#39;t get into trouble who am I to tell him how to have his hair cut.  He is now considering getting a second piercing in the catalidge of his ear to wear earrings that will go from one hole to the other.  I fully support this, he already wears tongue rings in his ear, and I love how creative he is with it.  <br/>

Alex (15) has just today again cut some of his hair (by accident ?!) and evened it out in a way. Tomorrow we may have a barber session, maybe. He wants the front and top short and the back left to grow a ponytail. :)<br/>

  My son has sported a mohawk since he was 10, he is now 15. We dye it different colors and try out different patterns. He loves it, and it gives us one more thing to bond over. My mom was the same way, and my response is &quot;It&#39;s only hair!&quot; If my child is kind, considerate, works hard and doesn&#39;t get into trouble who am I to tell him how to have his hair cut. He is now considering getting a second piercing in the catalidge of his ear to wear earrings that will go from one hole to the other. I fully support this, he already wears tongue rings in his ear, and I love how creative he is with it. <br/>

  My mother is mad at me because I did it. She said &quot;My grandsons aren&#39;t<br/>
  punks&quot; among other things. But they are really happy and they aren&#39;t even<br/>
  true mowhawks. Just a strip of hair on top of an otherwise bald head. It<br/>
  doesn&#39;t go down the back of the skull and sticks up maybe 3/4 of an inch or<br/>
  so. It&#39;s not as if I got their noses pierced! Oh well she&#39;ll have to get<br/>
  over it.<br/>

  &gt; I love mohawks! I had my first when I was 12 (1985!) and my dd (now 10)<br/>
  &gt; has<br/>

Please don&#39;t be sorry!!! I wasn&#39;t hurt or offended, I just have a very<br/>
low tolerance for people that are harshly judgmental that way. I&#39;m<br/>

I realize your Mum is working off her own fears/hang-ups etc.. like<br/>
anyone else. I just get my hackles up over ignorant comments about<br/>
such silly things as hair or other forms of expression. I&#39;m really<br/>
glad you could find it in your heart to honor your children&#39;s desire<br/>
to experiment with a new look. That&#39;s very cool!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-203029216">****It&#39;s not as if I got their noses pierced!****<br/>
<br/>
Hi Karen,<br/>
<br/>
LOL about the nose piercing. My 5 1/2 dd asked if kids her age could<br/>
get their noses pierced. I said if their parents let them. She asked<br/>
if I would let her. I said if she really wanted to, then sure we would<br/>
look into it. We talked about what it felt like compared to her ear<br/>
piercings, how long it took to heal, if it bled, etc. Then she said &quot;I<br/>
don&#39;t really want to get my nose pierced, I just wanted to know if I<br/>
could&quot;. I didn&#39;t think she really wanted to but I was fully prepared<br/>
to go through with it.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, her 16yo sister has her nose pierced and bright purple<br/>
streaks in her hair,I have tattoos and piercings and have shaved my<br/>
head completely at times, her dad is 33 and sports a mohawk at this<br/>
time (he is in management and has to dress for work, he is sooo cute).<br/>
<br/>
Peace and Joy,<br/>

<br/>
My guys would like to decorate their mohawks & I&#39;d like to put a little bit of rainbow in my hair streaked in with the white... <br/>

Originally only one of our boys had one but then a couple of weeks ago Gary had fun with the clippers & did all 4 of them... they&#39;re having fun making their own hair gel with gelatin...<br/>

Okay y&#39;all...what do you use to get bright/fun colors in hair? ~~<br/>
<br/>
I like the manic panic best. It fades over several washings (depending<br/>
on the color and porosity of hair) so I can change it up every few<br/>
weeks. If the area to be dyed is already bleached, it&#39;s really easy to<br/>
use. Just brush in the gel formula, let it sit and then wash it out.<br/>
We like to leave it in twice as long as they say on the directions though.<br/>
<br/>
I especially love the turquoise, purple and pink colors. Lotsa fun!<br/>

Okay y&#39;all...what do you use to get bright/fun colors in hair? I know about Koolaid & am not sure how much of a pain that is or if you can get better colors from other products?<br/>
<br/>
My guys would like to decorate their mohawks & I&#39;d like to put a little bit of rainbow in my hair streaked in with the white... <br/>
<br/>
Originally only one of our boys had one but then a couple of weeks ago Gary had fun with the clippers & did all 4 of them... they&#39;re having fun making their own hair gel with gelatin...<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-942087152">We go to Hot Topic and buy their hair dye, which I believe is Manic Panic.  I&#39;ve also heard that Sally Hansen beauty supply stores carry temporary hair dye in lots of different, bright colors for a fairly cheap price.  My son prefers the darker colors, they tend to stay in longer than the lighter ones.  My daughter is currently thinking of dying her hair, which already has blonde streaks in it, to a bright purple or a dark green.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2123067486">Thanks, Ren & Vickisue! I found a couple of sites to get Manic Panic & we&#39;re all talking about what colors we want... 2 of them want the electric sunshine color, one wants enchanted forest or electric lizard, I&#39;m thinking about turquoise along with some of the others that others want for a rainbow effect. :)<br/>
<br/>
Ren: what happens if the area we want to color is not bleached? Would it just be harder for the color to set in properly? Also, what about the white area of my hair on top, would that still need bleaching?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;if you know me, then you already know. if&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s a muggle thing: muggles don&#39;t get it, I guess...<br/>
