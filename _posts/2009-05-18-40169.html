<div id="ygrps-yiv-855777181">ok here is my frustration.  myself -- I am so tired of telling myself --&quot;tday&quot; I will think before I speak and wham I blow like a raving lunatic (ok maybe not that bad but? or is it?)  I understand I&#39;ve always been high strung  quick to have a tantrum (when I was a infant even-- so my mom says) and up to now.  example child spills coffee I know it should and is know big deal that why i have hard wood floors right?  and no big deal he pooped in his underwear? but why do I get frustrated ?  inconvenient to me?  god forbid he interrupted my reading! <br/>
    Anyone else out there that has had to really, really work on their &#39;temper&#39;?  I have posted in past but I often step away for awhile.  almost like I have to digest stuff , think it over and implement stuff (or not in this case) and than I&#39;m back ready to let go, search, understand.  <br/>
<br/>
  while I&#39;ve been unschooling i&#39;ve learned to say why not? say yes more. let go of old issues (like are they going to learn if not in school?? duh yeah-- full fledge belief now in learning naturally...) I catch myself faster and shut up quicker, apologize hug and thank more.  <br/>
<br/>
 but I still haven&#39;t learned to let the temper go... I believe there are times we have a right to be angry but we can express ourselves without yelling and saying things that are just stupid.  (i&#39;m also good at blaming -- like I&#39;m trying not to yell but your doing things to piss me off) nice huh.  no got to stop this it&#39;s my problem not theirs and I&#39;ve had conversations telling my boys that they are my biggest teachers and that I am learning .....<br/>
<br/>
talk to me please.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1336357359">Oh Yeah I hear you. I am just like that.<br/>
I work EVERYDAY at not reacting to stuff that way.<br/>
A few things to look for that can make it worse or help:<br/>
<br/>
* hunger- make sure to get some protein to keep blood sugar stable<br/>
* tired<br/>
*take deep breaths- or walk away and calm down <br/>
* make sure you diet is good- some Omega oils and Folic acid help tons to mental health<br/>
* exercise helps wonders for me<br/>
<br/>
Those are basic self care actions you can take.<br/>
Everyday I think about what I could have done better. I apologize to my kids a lot. I leave the guilt behind as much as I can because it does not help me.<br/>
Make a decision TODAY that you will not react that way and just do it. Sounds simple but it has worked for me big time ( thanks to my friends Schuyler who I talked about it ).<br/>
Being angry is OK, screaming and saying thinks you regret another.<br/>
If you need to walk away to calm down do so. Tell you child you need to calm down and you are there if he needs you.<br/>
I know more people will have other great ideas to help.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1696482433">I always hear Kelly and Pam! :-)<br/>
<br/>
People generally default back to the way they were socialized when  <br/>
extremely stressed. I have the same issue. When stressed I tend to  <br/>
grab the most tried and true tool from my box. Screaming, yelling,  <br/>
tantruming...<br/>
<br/>
What I have done to allievate the need to default is to catch myself  <br/>
before I get too worked up. I started to notice my triggers. Have you  <br/>
read The Explosive Child? That has some ideas on how to do it with  <br/>
children, I just apply it to me! Also remember:<br/>
H- hungry<br/>
A- angry<br/>
L- lonely, needing attention<br/>
T- tired or thirsty<br/>
<br/>
This will help with a lot of out bursts. Another way is to build you  <br/>
tool collection. Build it full of beautiful loving tools. Listen to  <br/>
audio of cons like Diana suggested, read insightful books which are  <br/>
listed in a database on the unschooling basics site, read Sandra and  <br/>
Joyces pages and hang up inspirational stuff around the house.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of saying I&#39;ll never tantrum again think about what othertools  <br/>
you have, I will use XYZ instead of yelling next time. Have game plans  <br/>
in line for common mishaps such as spills.<br/>
<br/>
Move on. Guilt and feeling like crap about your learning takes are not  <br/>
going to solve the issue, thank yourself and your child for this  <br/>
opportunity to know yourself deeper ave become a better person. Love  <br/>
your child, apologize, learn from your mistakes and move on. When I  <br/>
started doing that my daughter thanked me. She said the depression  <br/>
that followed my tantrums were worse than anything I said or did.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-626118905">LOL I don&#39;t have just one voice in my head - I try to &#39;explain&#39; the<br/>
situation to the lot of you. If it comes out like a long and garbled<br/>
post, something is amiss and needs looking at because that&#39;s when I&#39;m<br/>
usually trying to defend or justify my position/actions/reactions rather<br/>
than stepping back, taking a breath, and seeing the situation calmly<br/>
(like when the fridge door fell off this morning - got a call from DH<br/>
just after I got to work to tell me that - boy is it a Monday! But, it<br/>
can be replaced, the door can &#39;sit&#39; there to keep the cold in (even<br/>
though it takes two to get anything out of the fridge!), and no one was<br/>
injured in the process - that could have happened last night when DS<br/>
went to get some cheddar out at 1 am when DH and I were already asleep<br/>
and that would have been SERIOUS! As it is, the new one arrives<br/>
tomorrow, we have a good chuckle over the old thing, and we&#39;re having<br/>
freshly made bagels with homemade cream cheese for dinner tonight!)<br/>

<br/>
It helps to focus on the positive whenever you can. You&#39;re growing, that&#39;s wonderful! It takes time and work to break old habits and build new ones.<br/>
<br/>
I used to blow up pretty easily. Now, not so much, and I&#39;ve learned to do it in ways that aren&#39;t as scary to the people I love. It wasn&#39;t an instant change, though. I floundered my way from yelling, to stopping in the middle of yelling and apologising, to rarely yelling (and stopping in the middle and apologising).<br/>
<br/>
Something that helps me get through any kind of transitional process like that is to remind myself of what my typical process &quot;looks like&quot;. I&#39;m going to get stuck over and over - that&#39;s part of my process. Remembering that helps me relax a little and trust the process itself. Relaxing helps me not get stuck quite so often, which helps me have more confidence, which helps me get stuck even less... until I get to the point of looking back and saying &quot;hey, I haven&#39;t had that problem in awhile, cool.&quot; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-533494951">This may be a weird analogy, but when I practiced EC with my daughter, it<br/>
was more about training myself to tune in than about training herI at times<br/>
used a 30 minute timer to remind myself to offer her a pee. Maybe you could<br/>
do the same for yourselfuse a cell phone timer or digital watch or minute<br/>
timer or whatever, but something that can always be with you. Set it to go<br/>
off in very short intervals, and when it does remind yourself to breathe,<br/>
that whatever happens in the next time period will be no big deal, ectafter<br/>
a week or 2 of 30 minute intervals, it may just become second nature?<br/>
<br/>
Another thing, my daughter (2 ½) says sh!t in perfect contextlearned from<br/>
me of course. When I realized what was going onI immediately replaced all<br/>
of my expletives with no big deal It took some work on my part, but I<br/>
didnt really want her running around and cussingher cussing is much<br/>
improved, now she mostly says no big deal too, but the unanticipated side<br/>
effect was that I was constantly reminding myself (out loud) that most of<br/>
the things that frustrated me were no big deal. Really removed a lot of<br/>
stress (I didnt even realize I was experiencing) from my day!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1123495890">They _ARE_ hard to change, because you have had these habits for years and years.  I would guess I have been angry and irritated for nigh on 25 years...and that will not change overnight.  Just like deschooling takes a while, so does breaking and re-establishing a new habit.<br/>
<br/>
That is where Thich Naht Hahn&#39;s book came in for me.  It helped me realize what my instant reactions are, how they hurt me _and_ others, and gave me techniques to use to create a new reaction, one of peace, compassion, and understanding.<br/>
<br/>
And I am still working on it, as I suspect I will be every day of my life.<br/>
<br/>
I would not look upon anger as something foreign to me that I have to fight...I have to deal with my anger with care, with love, with tenderness, with nonviolence. -Thich Naht Hahn<br/>

      This may be a weird analogy, but when I practiced EC with my daughter, it<br/>
<br/>
was more about training myself to tune in than about training her…I at times<br/>
<br/>
used a 30 minute timer to remind myself to offer her a pee. Maybe you could<br/>
<br/>
do the same for yourself…use a cell phone timer or digital watch or minute<br/>
<br/>
timer or whatever, but something that can always be with you. Set it to go<br/>
<br/>
off in very short intervals, and when it does remind yourself to breathe,<br/>
<br/>
that whatever happens in the next time period will be no big deal, ect…after<br/>
<br/>
a week or 2 of 30 minute intervals, it may just become second nature?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Another thing, my daughter (2 ½) says “sh!t” in perfect context…learned from<br/>
<br/>
me of course. When I realized what was going on…I immediately replaced all<br/>
<br/>
of my expletives with “no big deal” It took some work on my part, but I<br/>
<br/>
didn’t really want her running around and cussing…her cussing is much<br/>
<br/>
improved, now she mostly says “no big deal” too, but the unanticipated side<br/>
<br/>
effect was that I was constantly reminding myself (out loud) that most of<br/>
<br/>
the things that frustrated me were no big deal. Really removed a lot of<br/>
<br/>
stress (I didn’t even realize I was experiencing) from my day!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-832780060">Very timely.... LOL... I really, really, really need to retrain my<br/>
mouth.  I&#39;ve been cussing more and more, and it really DOES escalate<br/>
whatever situation.  I&#39;ve learned this recently.  If I can shut myself<br/>
up... if I can NOT whine/complain/worst of all yell... I feel better<br/>
about things.  I feel 20 times more angry or upset or stressed if I<br/>
&quot;let it out.&quot;  I used to believe wholeheartedly that bottling up<br/>
feelings would make me explode.  That I had to let them out.  But it&#39;s<br/>
not true.  If I grumble and bitch about something, it&#39;s as if I feel<br/>
like I *have* to be cranky about it longer... I have to justify what I<br/>
just said... have to live up to it.  I hope that makes sense, because<br/>
I&#39;m also having a really hard time lately with choosing the correct<br/>
words to describe what I mean.  Apparently I just shouldn&#39;t be saying<br/>
much at all.  :-)  Take a temporary vow of silence.  LOL  Maybe I&#39;ll<br/>
get my brain back when I get to my second trimester.<br/>
<br/>
But, anyway, yeah... my four year old uses variations of &quot;f*ck&quot; sooooo<br/>
much.  Because I do.  And it really upsets me to hear it coming from<br/>
him, for some reason, so I&#39;m trying to watch my mouth.  I didn&#39;t know<br/>
what to say instead, though.  &quot;No big deal&quot; seems like an EXCELLENT<br/>
choice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1854007668">so there&#39;s yet another bitchy &#39;becky&#39; bothered by her own banter --- LOL   we are not alone.  I don&#39;t know where I read a story lately but the main jist was to say &quot;this is good&quot; when things seem not so.  IT WORKS&gt;  the other day I was getting flustered because I was cleaning dishes not mine and other stuff and when I said these words a few times I felt relaxed and dismissed the &#39;anger&#39;.  Now I just need to work a little harder when I&#39;m trying to do something and 3 year old insists on bestering and he really just needs to leave me alone for a couple ??!! I bet if I just gave him the few minutes and whispered &quot;this is good&quot; to myself and him we would both be ok.  (but if I sit down with him I&#39;ll fall asleep too -- lol). <br/>
