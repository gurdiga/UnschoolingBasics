Educationese <br/>
Educationese- {or Teacherese} is the name sometimes given to the jargon too frequently employed by some of those who train our schoolteachers. It is characterized typically by its humorlessly abstract, Latinate, and polysyllabic diction and its involuted, rambling, and frequently passive syntax. Its fights are never fights and rarely even quarrels; they&#39;re conflict situations. At its worst, instead of correcting imprecision and ignorance, it tries to conceal them, frequently even from itself.    Ref: The Columbia Guide to Standard American English<br/>
 <br/>
When you begin to Homeschool [ *if your state requires you to keep daily records of what your child has learned ] , you may find it difficult translate to Educationese. And if you have decided &quot;unschooling&quot; is the right path for your family, you may find things even more difficult. <br/>
<br/>
However, using the key elements of learning - interest + pratice = better understanding - it can become easy. Relax, knowledge is power. <br/>
 <br/>
Teachers in public schools were taught a method in college. They take a simple activity and turn it in to a something that sounds impressive. It is a language that educators understand. Everything is learning, so surprisingly, you can call most of life &quot;school&quot;.<br/>
It&#39;s also useful to answer that typical question &quot;What DO your kids do all day?&quot;. <br/>
