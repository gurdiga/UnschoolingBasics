<div id="ygrps-yiv-1513931308">As I have mentioned before, we pretend like there is a tooth fairy, but everyone in my house know it&#39;s just a game for us.<br/>
 <br/>
My 9 year old lost a tooth this week and we had this conversation;<br/>
 <br/>
DD, &quot;Is the tooth fairy going to come visit?&quot;<br/>
Me, &quot;I don&#39;t know, do you want the tooth fairy to come?&quot;<br/>
DD, &quot;Well, I would rather the tooth fairy just take me to the dollar store to buy something.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
So off we went to the dollar store!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1108085443">Just in case you didn&#39;t get enough traditional parenting: the one I was <br/>
really upset by is the very last segment- a defense of parents screaming <br/>
and cursing at their children.<br/>
