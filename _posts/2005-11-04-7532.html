It&#39;s interesting this was your sig line.....I had this very saying<br/>
going through my head all morning.:)<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like your family has some major control issues...yuck! <br/>
Glad you woke up and started making your children&#39;s feelings more<br/>
important than the extended family!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s my favorite quote. :)  And unfortunately so true.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oi...tell me about it.  But in thinking about the<br/>
control in my family, I came up with the possibility<br/>
that it might be more fear than control.  Meaning that<br/>
the fear is stemming from keeping up with the Jonese<br/>
or the law or whatever.  And of course, those fears<br/>
get handed down generation to generation.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Glad you woke up and started making your children&#39;s<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hehe...I&#39;ve been awake.  I remember back in high<br/>
school telling my best friend that I am never sending<br/>
my kids to school and that I&#39;ll be home with them all<br/>
day, every day; baking cookies, going to the park, tra<br/>
la la la la....  <br/>
<br/>
It guess was because I just couldn&#39;t find the right<br/>
words to explain my position or they just didn&#39;t<br/>
listen.  Who knows, but THEN after 42 years of life,I<br/>
come to find out, (insert lightbulb here), it wasn&#39;t<br/>
my voice after all! &lt;g&gt;  It was the ACTIONS that I<br/>
took with my kids. <br/>
Ok now all say it with me....Actions speak louder than<br/>
words.  LOL!  I know you all were thinking it. ;p  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I just did it.  Like jumping into a pool. <br/>
They freaked; John acted like Fred Sanford going to<br/>
meet Elizabeth, Mom wrung her hands and fretted at me,<br/>
In-laws threatened to never speak to me again, blah...<br/>
But everyone is backing off now that they see the kids<br/>
aren&#39;t dead or had their brains ooze out of their ears<br/>
from lack of school.  They see happy, confident kids<br/>
with minds of their own (staying in their skull). <br/>
Eww..gross I know. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Anyway...Hope and I are off today to go to the dog<br/>
park to see who we can meet.  She came up with that<br/>
idea. :D <br/>
<br/>
Have a Happy Saturday!!<br/>
<br/>
