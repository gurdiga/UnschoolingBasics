<div id="ygrps-yiv-1368554347">My favorite quote from John Holt is:  &quot;If we tried to teach kids to talk, they would never <br/>
learn.&quot;    <br/>
<br/>
 With that in mind, here are some thoughts on reading/writing with little children from my <br/>
own exprience.   Let me know if this is helpful.      <br/>
<br/>
When my son was little, my husband and I looked at books with him and read to and with <br/>
him from the time he had any interest (pre-toddler) until he lost interest (about age 5 or 6) <br/>
in doing this together.    We had no tv, and our favorite thing was the 3 of us cuddling up <br/>
together and reading children&#39;s books together.   We always had a stack from the library, <br/>
and I was very choosy in picking them out.    I figured that if I loved the book, our son <br/>
would love it too, and if it looked boring to me, it would not attract him either.  I looked <br/>
for illustrations that charmed me and I loved text that had dialog and sounds, or had a <br/>
rhythm and a beat.  There were a few books that illustrated songs, which we sang to him, <br/>
as well as other songs.   Mother Goose books seemed to have a special attraction, with <br/>
their short poetry and catchy rhythm and rhyme, as well as sharing part of our heritage.   <br/>
We did this only when our son wanted to, which he usually did.  This was a very close, <br/>
special and loving time we all three had together and we did it &#39;most every day and <br/>
spontaneously whenever we could.  <br/>
<br/>
 (If you have your own Mother Goose, or any beautiful book with short rhymes, or <br/>
charming short stories, which you often read --or sing--together, then when the child is <br/>
interested in looking at the words, he will already know what the words are, which will <br/>
help him later decipher the &quot;reading code&quot;.  The rhyming aspect is a special attraction to <br/>
listening to and remembering the words.)  <br/>
<br/>
And I don&#39;t remember exactly what we did with alphabet books, but I have had these <br/>
thoughts about them since:   That a beautifully illustrated alphabet book of some kind is a <br/>
treasure to have in one&#39;s own library.  (I was browsing through our local megabookstore <br/>
recently and had difficulty finding either a good Mother Goose or a good alphabet book.)     <br/>
I think  it is best if an alphabet book includes lower case letters, as the recognition of and <br/>
sound of the lower case letters is much more helpful than the name of capital letters.  <br/>
(That is, I think it&#39;s a general principle to give the child the most useful information first. )    <br/>
For example, instead of focusing on &quot;D&quot; and saying &quot;dee&quot;, you could focus on &quot;d&quot; and say <br/>
&quot;duh&quot; to identify that symbol.  (Keep the &quot;uh&quot; short, as it&#39;s not really part of &quot;d&quot;.)  This is <br/>
not &quot;teaching reading&quot;, but it&#39;s identifying symbols just like you would identify a cow or a <br/>
chair.  And this does have an advantage in that the child has a leg up when he is ready to <br/>
&quot;read&quot;.     <br/>
<br/>
Also, if the child is sounding out words, it might be helpful for the adult to know to <br/>
verbalize, if it comes up, that besides  regular &quot;sound out&quot; words, there are sit-together <br/>
letters that make one sound (like &quot;sh&quot;), and there are puzzle words that are impossible to <br/>
sound out.     (Readers know this but some might not have thought about it or how to say <br/>
it to a child.)    I don&#39;t even know when our son &quot;learned to read&quot;, as we had no concern <br/>
about it and we just shared things about words whenever it came up.  (However, he did <br/>
read early, which I think is an advantage because reading is such fun and it builds <br/>
confidence.)   I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is that learning to read is not really an event--<br/>
it&#39;s a gestation process over years that starts in infancy with speech and progresses <br/>
through the little child&#39;s intense desire to explore everything and know what everything is, <br/>
including what those little squiggles are on signs and notes and computers and tv and <br/>
everywhere in our environment that relate to speech.   <br/>
<br/>
Also, if your family is writing notes to each other and writing in other ways, the little child <br/>
is likely to &quot;write&quot; too, as they pick up whatever is in their environment.    A lot of you are <br/>
probably writing a daily journal of activities (which is one way to meet homeschooling <br/>
requirements in my state).    Also, I find writing a note is a great way to get out feelings <br/>
when there is anger or frustration between people.   In a note, you can say all you want to <br/>
say without being interrupted, and it gives people a space between in which to calm down <br/>
and reflect.   And about writing, a huge mistake most schools make is to make the child <br/>
correct spelling which quickly shuts down any desire for the child to write.   This is <br/>
equivalent to saying, &quot;Don&#39;t talk until you can say the words correctly&quot;, which would make <br/>
a child mute fast.    My experience is that spelling mainly corrects itself over time and <br/>
experience, but it can always be addressed specifically at some later point if desired.   But, <br/>
as I see it, speaking, writing and reading are all different aspects of the same bag which <br/>
the little child tends to naturally absorb together from the environment--whatever is <br/>
happening a lot all around him over a long period of time. <br/>
