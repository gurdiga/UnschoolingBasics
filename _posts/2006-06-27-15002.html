It&#39;s funny, because back when Trevor was a wee little man (he&#39;s 16.5<br/>

we felt like spanking. It was about this time that my parents were<br/>
having major regrets about spanking and other issues. That letter is<br/>
archived at Sandra&#39;s site now.<br/>
<br/>
It was such a sweet letter, that I saved it for years and years. It<br/>
sounded nice, but  putting it into practice was SO damn hard when my<br/>

guinea pig for sure. I&#39;ve apologized to him many times.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really cool, that over the years I HAVE been able to change my<br/>
response. One good interaction, one better choice at a time, I&#39;ve<br/>
built up a cache of peaceful moments that lead to more of the same. If<br/>
you just do that each and every time a situation builds up, you<br/>
eventually change a lot of those old tapes.<br/>
<br/>
Jalen shoved Sierra down the stairs today and hurt her. I was really<br/>
upset, it had just come out of the blue, giving me NO chance to even<br/>
problem solve.<br/>
I really think he was joking around and didn&#39;t realize how close she<br/>
was to the stairs, because he looked shocked. I turned and barked<br/>
something angry at him and he stomped off, slamming a door.<br/>
<br/>
After I made sure Sierra was alright, I knocked on the door and told<br/>
him I needed to talk right now, please open the door. He reluctantly<br/>
opened it. I think if I ever hit him, or punished him, there&#39;s no WAY<br/>
he would have opened that door!  But he knows that even if I&#39;m pissed,<br/>
I&#39;m going to talk and hug and BE with him.<br/>
<br/>
So he opens it and I pick him up and hug him right away, thanking him<br/>
for letting me in because I was very upset. I explained that I was<br/>
upset because Sierra could have gotten hurt very badly and &quot;I love you<br/>
 and I love Sierra and I don&#39;t want anyone to get hurt&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He was very sorry. I&#39;m so glad that my instinct IS to hug and love<br/>
when things get rough. Now if I could just tame that darn first<br/>
response that cause him to slam the door in the first place.:)<br/>

saying I am by no means an extreme unschooler or much of an unschooler at<br/>
all.  I am just investigating options and other ideas (that is why I am<br/>
here).  Now I know you said you think he miscalculated her proximity to the<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I&#39;m not Ren, and I don&#39;t play her on TV, but jumping in here, <br/>
there is a tape called &quot;Peaceful Parenting.&quot;  It&#39;s a tape of a talk <br/>
that Sandra Dodd and Richard Pr....ski (sorry &#39;bout that!) did at a <br/>
conference some years ago.  I&#39;ve listened to it several times and <br/>
I&#39;ve since given it away.  I&#39;m telling you, one way that we could <br/>
move toward having a better, more peaceful, kinder world would be to <br/>
provide that tape with every newborn baby, or better yet, every <br/>
positive home pregnancy test result.  I&#39;m not kidding.<br/>
<br/>
There are a couple of things to keep in mind.  First, we do not know <br/>
what is in someone else&#39;s heart, and if we try to assume we run the <br/>
risk of misjudging a person.  I think that malicious acts are rarer <br/>
in little kids than folks in our society would have us believe.  I <br/>
think that things can get out of hand and can *look* that way, but ~ <br/>
and this is just a hunch on my part, nothing scientific ~ I think <br/>
that most of these *malicious* acts are just mistakes or accidents <br/>
that get out of hand.<br/>
<br/>
Second, if you think back to when you were little, you probably made <br/>
a lot of mistakes.  Some were inconsequential and some may have been <br/>
serious.  But, they were mistakes, and learning machines that we are, <br/>
making mistakes is one of the ways we learn (although sometimes we <br/>
have to keep making the same mistake before we get it).  I&#39;m guessing <br/>
that you were probably judged rather harshly for some of your <br/>
mistakes.  (Some kids are judged harshly for all of their <br/>
mistakes.)  And, you may have judged yourself rather harshly for <br/>
some, if not all, of your mistakes.  I don&#39;t know about you, but when <br/>
I feel I&#39;m being judge harshly or judged at all, a lot of not-so-good <br/>
thoughts and feelings arise.  I feel defensive and I also may feel <br/>
very angry at the victim.  Things get skewed and I don&#39;t see things properly.<br/>
<br/>
Now, imagine someone showing you, a little kid, compassion and <br/>
understanding at a time when you are judging yourself <br/>
harshly.  That&#39;s angelic.  And, it works wonders!<br/>
<br/>
I can imagine that if Ren had railed and ranted and punished Jalen <br/>
for his *mistake*, he would have become defensive and perhaps even <br/>
angry at Sierra, the victim of his mistake.  Inwardly, he would take <br/>
on and internalize all the terrible feelings he would have about the <br/>
incident and perhaps the terrible things that we said about him.  How <br/>
can a person with a mindset like that gain anything positive from his <br/>
experience?  But, by being shown compassion at a time when he needed <br/>
it most, *he* could show compassion.  That&#39;s such a huge thing!  And, <br/>
that&#39;s learning.<br/>
<br/>
The thing is, it&#39;s hard for us to make the compassionate response our <br/>
default response in times of extreme stress.  But, that&#39;s something <br/>
to move towards, and that&#39;s covered beautifully on that tape.  If you <br/>
can get a copy of it, it will light up your world!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I find it hard to instinctively reward a poor, unkind<br/>
&gt;choice.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Compassion is not a reward.  The trick is to let go of the concepts <br/>
of &quot;rewards&quot; and &quot;punishments.&quot;  Jalen wasn&#39;t being rewarded; he <br/>
needed a hug right then, and Ren was able to find the compassion <br/>
within herself to give Jalen what he needed.  Jalen needed that hug <br/>
just as much as Sierra did.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I find it hard to instinctively reward a poor, unkind<br/>
&gt;choice.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can understand that.  But, the more you make the choice to be more <br/>
compassionate in your responses, the closer you move to having <br/>
compassion be your instinctual response.<br/>
<br/>
It helps to acknowledge that every experience is one that we all~wee <br/>
ones and old ones~can learn and grow from.  Jalen had a powerful <br/>
learning experience today, and because he didn&#39;t have to waste his <br/>
time and energy feeling mean and defensive and angry at the world, he <br/>
will be able to absorb it and grow from it.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that helps a little.<br/>
<br/>
Compassionately yours,<br/>
<br/>

 <br/>
As I was reading this, I started thinking that the majority of people (at  <br/>
least people I come across in my everyday life at the store, the park, etc)seem  <br/>
to ONLY engage with their kids in a reward/punishment reaction.  When  the <br/>
child does something &quot;good&quot; they squeal and clap their hands, or say &quot;it&#39;s  <br/>
about time&quot; (which is a disguised punishment) and we all know what they do  when <br/>
the child does something &quot;bad&quot;.  The rest of the time, the kids are  more or <br/>
less ignored.<br/>
 <br/>
People on the more peaceful end of the parenting spectrum treat their  <br/>
children more like people, and they use less and less of the rewards and  <br/>
punishment.  Their lives are not as divided up into good and bad, and the  children are <br/>
connected part of the family (not just noticed when good or  bad).<br/>
 <br/>
So when Ren hugs Jalen, even after a bad choice, it isn&#39;t a reward because  <br/>
Jalen does not live in an environment of rewards and punishment.  He lives  in <br/>
a world of &quot;mommy loves me all the time, no matter what&quot;, not &quot;mommy only  <br/>
loves me when I&#39;m good&quot;.    In this context, it makes sense to  hug him, to <br/>
reaffirm that unconditional love commitment especially when he is  probably feeling <br/>
a bit less than lovable for hurting someone.<br/>
 <br/>
My pediatrician was trying to talk me into putting my kids in school and I  <br/>
said something stupid (well, it wasn&#39;t stupid, but only unschoolers could  <br/>
understand me!  LOL!).  I said &quot;but school is only about good and  bad, right and <br/>
wrong!&quot;.  He just said, &quot;um, yeah&quot;.  He had to be  thinking, &quot;well, duh, <br/>
lady....that&#39;s why we go to school!&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Leslie in SC, who is glad this conversation came up (in other words, my  kids <br/>
need a hug!)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s only a reward if you think of hugs and loving your children as<br/>
rewards.  I don&#39;t.  I don&#39;t think that hugs have to be earned.  &quot;You<br/>
did well therefore I am going to hug you.&quot;  That&#39;s the reaction of<br/>
most mainstream parents.  Our family hugs all the time.  We hug when<br/>
we wake, when we go to bed, when we leave the house, when we enter a<br/>
room, when we are standing next to each other, when we have the desire<br/>
for a physical connection with another person.  Hugs are not something<br/>
that you get when you are good.<br/>
<br/>
When Emily was 2-ish she would have these huge melting &quot;temper<br/>
tantrums&quot; (which we eventually found out was related to food<br/>
additives).  During that time she would get so worked up about<br/>
something that she would literally melt screaming and crying.  She was<br/>
unable to even voice what had upset her.  I found the only way to help<br/>
her was just to hold her and hold her and hold her until she finally<br/>
could calm down.  At the beginning it was hard because I truly was<br/>
having to force myself to hold/hug her after she had made a huge mess,<br/>
broken something, or been physically aggressive towards someone.  I<br/>
wasn&#39;t happy with her during those periods because she wasn&#39;t behaving<br/>
well.  But I held her anyway.  Sometimes she would fight me at the<br/>
beginning because she didn&#39;t want me to hold her.  I ended up with<br/>
many bruises and scratches (and once a pair of broken glasses) from<br/>
holding her.  Eventually she got to where she would come to me (a safe<br/>
space) when she would feel herself getting out of control.  It really<br/>
didn&#39;t take that long either, just a few weeks.<br/>
<br/>
We tend to associate hugs with love.  We don&#39;t hug people we don&#39;t<br/>
know or don&#39;t like.  So why would you deny love to a child you love<br/>
even though they have done something that makes you unhappy?  Do you<br/>
stop loving them then?  No.  But when you deny them love (and<br/>
generally when someone acts poorly they usually need love/hugs more<br/>
than ever) you are punishing them.<br/>

primarily to reward and punishment is thinking of them as animals who  <br/>
need training. It is an insult. It feels like being manipulated. It  <br/>
takes away a person&#39;s inner core, inner sense of self-determination.<br/>
<br/>
This has become conventional wisdom - kids need praise and stickers  <br/>
to induce them to do things and &quot;negative reinforcement&quot; to stop them  <br/>
from doing things.<br/>
<br/>
Not true.<br/>
<br/>
They need experience, information, love, and support. They really do  <br/>
not need external rewards or punishments imposed on them.<br/>

it most, *he* could show compassion. That&#39;s such a huge thing! And, <br/>
that&#39;s learning.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with showing compassion but I also think disapproval ought to be<br/>
shown.  Like this is not ok.  This is not what we do.  Followed up by a<br/>
brief discussion of how to make better choices next time.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I must admit, this is exactly what I have been trying to accomplish as a<br/>
mother without even realizing there was a tape.  No wonder it is taking all<br/>
this time, and offering a hug following a poor choice probably would have<br/>
been a few more years off! LOL.  Seriously, I would like to hear the tape. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Compassion is not a reward.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i agree but it is still hard for me to be instinctively compassionate<br/>
towards someone who has been unkind.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The trick is to let go of the concepts <br/>
 </span></blockquote>of &quot;rewards&quot; and &quot;punishments.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But life is both rewarding and punishing.  For example, he may have been<br/>
punished by sierra breaking her neck and dying.  Is it not better that we<br/>
help them understand the natural flow of positive and negative consequences<br/>
before it comes to something like that?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;Jalen wasn&#39;t being rewarded; he <br/>
 </span></blockquote>needed a hug right then, and Ren was able to find the compassion <br/>
within herself to give Jalen what he needed. Jalen needed that hug <br/>
just as much as Sierra did.<br/>
<br/>
I get that now.  Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I can understand that. But, the more you make the choice to be more <br/>
 </span></blockquote>compassionate in your responses, the closer you move to having <br/>
compassion be your instinctual response.<br/>
<br/>
I agree and I work at this daily.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Jalen had a powerful <br/>
 </span></blockquote>learning experience today, and because he didn&#39;t have to waste his <br/>
time and energy feeling mean and defensive and angry at the world, he <br/>
will be able to absorb it and grow from it.<br/>
<br/>
yes, I agree with this but here is a totally honest account of how I would<br/>
likely have reacted had this happened in my house today:<br/>
<br/>
I would have ranted and railed (I am not proud to admit this, but I am being<br/>
honest) at the pusher and given very disapproving looks.  I would have sent<br/>
them off to think about what they had done and I would have tended to the<br/>
injured child.  After I had time to calm down I would have gone to the<br/>
pusher and done my best to talk calmly.  I would have apologized for my<br/>
panicked outburst and explained I still need work at controlling my<br/>
instinctive reactions.  I would have asked them about their choice and if<br/>
they felt they would have done anything differently next time.  When this<br/>
little &quot;talk&quot; was over I would have hugged them then and asked them to<br/>
please apologize to their sibling.  I am sharing this candid response to<br/>
show that my first reaction would not be to run over and hug the pusher.  I<br/>
would feel quite angry at the choice he made and I would have a hard time<br/>
showing any compassion until I calmed down and made sure the one at the<br/>
bottom of the stairs was ok.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I hope that helps a little.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>it helps a lot, actually.  After reading your email and thinking more about<br/>
this I tried it out.  My ds/4 was in a very uncharacteristically angry mood.<br/>
He was pouting and swatting at his siblings over a movie choice or something<br/>
(ie: he was just over-tired).  I went over to him and held his swatting arms<br/>
down as I hugged him.  At first he tried to swat at me twice.  I said<br/>
something like, &quot;please don&#39;t swat at mama.  Please let me hug you&quot; and he<br/>
immediately melted into me.  He had a good cry and big long hug and then he<br/>
lifted his head to look at me and said, &quot;mama please can I have a snack?&quot; so<br/>
he was tired and hungry!  Not a good combo.  I was pleased how the hug<br/>
worked.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-153123682"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;As I was reading this, I started thinking that the majority of people (at <br/>
 </span></blockquote>least people I come across in my everyday life at the store, the park,<br/>
etc)seem <br/>
to ONLY engage with their kids in a reward/punishment reaction. When the <br/>
child does something &quot;good&quot; they squeal and clap their hands, or say &quot;it&#39;s <br/>
about time&quot; (which is a disguised punishment) and we all know what they do<br/>
when <br/>
the child does something &quot;bad&quot;. The rest of the time, the kids are more or <br/>
less ignored.<br/>
<br/>
People on the more peaceful end of the parenting spectrum treat their <br/>
children more like people, and they use less and less of the rewards and <br/>
punishment. Their lives are not as divided up into good and bad, and the<br/>
children are <br/>
connected part of the family (not just noticed when good or bad).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So when Ren hugs Jalen, even after a bad choice, it isn&#39;t a reward because <br/>
Jalen does not live in an environment of rewards and punishment. He lives in<br/>
<br/>
a world of &quot;mommy loves me all the time, no matter what&quot;, not &quot;mommy only <br/>
loves me when I&#39;m good&quot;. In this context, it makes sense to hug him, to <br/>
reaffirm that unconditional love commitment especially when he is probably<br/>
feeling <br/>
a bit less than lovable for hurting someone.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that many of you feel that if a person is not subscribed to a<br/>
&quot;peaceful parenting&quot; or unschooling philosophy they are just not as good<br/>
parents.  That they do not love their children unconditionally and that they<br/>
are only concerned with rewarding good behaviors, punishing bad ones and<br/>
ignoring the children inbetween.  Is this the case?<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry if I seem defensive but I must admit I am having a hard time with<br/>
the vibe on this list.  I think most people that homeschool their kids are<br/>
pretty plugged in to them, but the sense I get in here is that you are not<br/>
as plugged in as when you are a peaceful parenting unschooler.  You see, I<br/>
came to these unschooling lists to explore and learn and I am happy to have<br/>
lists like these to do so but I am being very honest when I say that some of<br/>
you come across very strongly with a sort of elitism. i am sure you do not<br/>
mean for this to be the case, but I thought it was important for you to know<br/>
that you may be perceived this way occasionally by visitors/explorers like<br/>
myself.  It may turn people off to your values and you may lose some<br/>
otherwise kindred.<br/>
<br/>
Honestly yours,<br/>

did well therefore I am going to hug you.&quot; That&#39;s the reaction of<br/>
most mainstream parents.<br/>
<br/>
All I suggested is that I find it hard to expect that our instinctive<br/>
reaction following a poor, unkind choice would be a hug.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Our family hugs all the time. We hug when<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Hugs are not something<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that you get when you are good.<br/>
<br/>
Well to be totally honest, my kids gets hugs all the time even after they<br/>
have made a bad choice but it is only after we are clear that it was a bad<br/>
choice and that better choices need to made in the future.  This is not<br/>
because I only love my children at times I hug them.  I love my kids at all<br/>
times, hugs or no.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;When Emily was 2-ish she would have these huge melting &quot;temper<br/>
 </span></blockquote>tantrums&quot; (which we eventually found out was related to food<br/>
additives).<br/>
<br/>
I believe this.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;During that time she would get so worked up about<br/>
 </span></blockquote>something that she would literally melt screaming and crying. She was<br/>
unable to even voice what had upset her. I found the only way to help<br/>
her was just to hold her and hold her and hold her until she finally<br/>
could calm down. At the beginning it was hard because I truly was<br/>
having to force myself to hold/hug her after she had made a huge mess,<br/>
broken something, or been physically aggressive towards someone. I<br/>
wasn&#39;t happy with her during those periods because she wasn&#39;t behaving<br/>
well. But I held her anyway. Sometimes she would fight me at the<br/>
beginning because she didn&#39;t want me to hold her. I ended up with<br/>
many bruises and scratches (and once a pair of broken glasses) from<br/>
holding her. Eventually she got to where she would come to me (a safe<br/>
space) when she would feel herself getting out of control. It really<br/>
didn&#39;t take that long either, just a few weeks.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wow, this is exactly how things went with my ds/now 8.  Around the time he<br/>
was 2 or 3 he just did not have the words to express himself so it all came<br/>
out emotionally/physically.  It came down to the forced &quot;hugging&quot; with him<br/>
too as if I did not I was afraid he would seriously hurt someone or himself.<br/>
As he got older, these outbursts gradually extinguished.  Now when he feels<br/>
badly at 8 years old, he will come and hug me.  I guess I had not thought<br/>
about that until now. :-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;We tend to associate hugs with love. We don&#39;t hug people we don&#39;t<br/>
 </span></blockquote>know or don&#39;t like. So why would you deny love to a child you love<br/>
even though they have done something that makes you unhappy? <br/>
<br/>
I would never deny my child love.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Do you<br/>
 </span></blockquote>stop loving them then? No. But when you deny them love (and<br/>
generally when someone acts poorly they usually need love/hugs more<br/>
than ever) you are punishing them.<br/>
<br/>
To be honest, I do feel a child who deliberately hurts another child does<br/>
require a punishment or in the very least, disapproval.   However, all<br/>
children deserve love at all times. <br/>

As far as making a choice, this is not always clear to people <br/>
either.  My daughter has always had great difficulty controlling <br/>

actions are a choice.  She very often acts before considering <br/>

***I have found that it is more helpful to provide information about <br/>
the other person&#39;s experience, than to approve or disapprove of the <br/>
actions. I believe that children are inherently harmonious and <br/>
desire to be peaceful. There is a saying &#39;children hurt, when they <br/>
hurt&#39;. It seems to me to be more effective to discern the underlying <br/>
needs when someone strikes out, rather than punishing anyone for <br/>
having some unmet need that they didn&#39;t know how to meet in a more <br/>
constructive (less hurtful) manner. Facilitating a child with <br/>
information about the effect of one&#39;s actions by helping to create <br/>
awareness of the experience of others (concrete observations), and <br/>
trying to understand the child&#39;s needs, and supportively seeking <br/>
alternative means to meet their needs seems much more constructive <br/>
and portable to model than punishments. <br/>
<br/>
But, punishments are much quicker external modifications of <br/>
behavior. Unfortunately, they are not internally motivated <br/>
alterations in behavior; and therefore are not as effective when not <br/>
authoritatively imposed. However, the authoritative imposition of <br/>
punishments is NOT a very positive relationship building paradigm. <br/>
Nor does it make it easier to unschool as a trusted advisor.<br/>

 I would be willing to consider that they are more so ignorance or poor<br/>
  habituation, yes, but I do not see a deliberate choice as an accident. <br/>
For<br/>
  example, Jalen made the choice to shove his sister, that was no <br/>
accident. I<br/>
  can see that her falling down the stairs was an accident. I do agree <br/>
that<br/>
 making the choice to shove her in the first place was a mistake.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  You don&#39;t KNOW it wasn&#39;t an accident. I just left Ren&#39;s house. The <br/>
stairs are in a funny place (IMO! &lt;g&gt;). Someone could easily have been <br/>
knocked down accidentally.<br/>
<br/>
  Plus, you&#39;re assuming the worst from the get-go. How about assuming <br/>
the BEST?!<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;and I also may feel very angry at the victim.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote> No to this<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 So you were angry with the victim FIRST?<br/>
<br/>
 And not AFTER the punishment?<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I do not get this. Surely he understands she did not shove herself <br/>
down the<br/>
 stairs? And I did not suggest someone ought to rail or rant against the<br/>
 child.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Yet later in this post you DO say that *you* would have ranted and <br/>
railed.<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;I would have ranted and railed (I am not proud to admit this, but I <br/>
am being<br/>
 honest) at the pusher and given very disapproving looks. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
  That&#39;s very typical parenting behavior---some would call it <br/>
instinctive. :-(<br/>
<br/>
  We&#39;d just like for you to look at it in a different way. To see your <br/>
child as doing his *best* at all times.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

 So how do you think a better way to approach it would be?<br/>

<br/>
 Hugs FIRST!<br/>
<br/>
 Then discussion.<br/>
<br/>
  No one here is saying *not* to discuss what happened and to talk about <br/>
how Sierra was feeling. But Jalen was not trying to hurt Sierra. <br/>
Something got out of hand. I seriously doubt it was deliberate---and <br/>
it&#39;s best to *assume* that going in!<br/>
<br/>
  When we were there, Jalen got to playing too rough with Ben (my <br/>
husband). He was pretty wound up and was swinging his swimsuit and <br/>
struck Ben in the eye. Ben grabbed his arm and held him away. Jalen <br/>
went running to Ren because he was scared. We know it wasn&#39;t <br/>
deliberately done to hurt Ben---they were playing. But it got out of <br/>
hand, and Ben was hurt. Jalen went running to Ren, who hugged him until <br/>
he settled down.<br/>
<br/>
  Would it have been better for *any* of us for her to have shamed him <br/>
or punished him for accidently hurting Ben?<br/>
<br/>
  He got consoled, he avoided Ben for an hour or so! &lt;G&gt;, and everything <br/>
was fine in a bit.<br/>

<br/>
 I would have asked them about their choice and if<br/>
 they felt they would have done anything differently next time.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Maybe the mom could do this too? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 When this<br/>
 little &quot;talk&quot; was over I would have hugged them then and asked them to<br/>
 please apologize to their sibling.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 HOT button! Making someone apologize. Yuck!<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I am sharing this candid response to<br/>
  show that my first reaction would not be to run over and hug the <br/>
pusher. I<br/>
  would feel quite angry at the choice he made and I would have a hard <br/>
time<br/>
 showing any compassion until I calmed down and made sure the one at the<br/>
 bottom of the stairs was ok.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Sure. We understand. Most of us have been where you are. There IS a <br/>
better way though.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  it helps a lot, actually. After reading your email and thinking more <br/>
about<br/>
  this I tried it out. My ds/4 was in a very uncharacteristically angry <br/>
mood.<br/>
  He was pouting and swatting at his siblings over a movie choice or <br/>
something<br/>
  (ie: he was just over-tired). I went over to him and held his swatting <br/>
arms<br/>
 down as I hugged him. At first he tried to swat at me twice. I said<br/>
  something like, &quot;please don&#39;t swat at mama. Please let me hug you&quot; and <br/>
he<br/>
  immediately melted into me. He had a good cry and big long hug and <br/>
then he<br/>
  lifted his head to look at me and said, &quot;mama please can I have a <br/>
snack?&quot; so<br/>
 he was tired and hungry! Not a good combo. I was pleased how the hug<br/>
 worked.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Cool.<br/>
<br/>
  He wasn&#39;t really being mean or bad---he was not in control of himself <br/>
because he was tired and hungry. In time, he will be better able to <br/>
know when he&#39;s getting crabby that he&#39;s hungry or tired or both. Maybe <br/>
let him know that could be *why* he was acting out. *Assume* he&#39;s doing <br/>
the best that he can at all times. It&#39;ll be better for your <br/>
relationship!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1884773486">I wanted to add again. I understand the emotions that fly up,  <br/>
especially when your protective mama instinct comes up. Regardless of  <br/>
who the offender is, even one of your own children, if your child is  <br/>
hurt you want to protect them.<br/>
<br/>
Our daughter Breanna has autism. She has many many behaviors that are  <br/>
not considered acceptable, and we have worked long and hard to  <br/>
replace those behaviors with those that *are* acceptable. So instead  <br/>
of hitting, using words, instead of kicking, walking away, instead of  <br/>
screaming, finding mama for help. The worst thing that could happen  <br/>
to her, if she hurts someone, is for someone&#39;s mom to come running up  <br/>
and yelling. Because at that point, Bre has lost focus on what just  <br/>
happened, and now her focus is totally on the person yelling at her.  <br/>
She&#39;s already emotionally unstable, and someone is hurting HER  <br/>
aurally, emotionally, etc. There is no chance that we can revisit  <br/>
what just happened and replay it with a better ending. She has  <br/>
learned nothing from the situation, except that you cannot trust the  <br/>
world. To her it seemed reasonable at the time. To have someone with  <br/>
an irrational (to her) response come up, completely negates any  <br/>
learning she has done on how to treat people.<br/>
<br/>
The longer we live with her, the more I see this play out in children  <br/>
who do NOT have disabilities. It&#39;s much more subtle because other  <br/>
children have the capability to hide emotions. But the damage done is  <br/>
no less, and the lessons are still lost.<br/>
<br/>
If a person can yell at someone, then apologize and speak nicely and  <br/>
explained what happened, why not just skip all the meanness to begin  <br/>
with, and go straight to what went wrong?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;I can imagine that if Ren had railed and ranted and punished Jalen<br/>
&gt;for his *mistake*, he would have become defensive and perhaps even<br/>
&gt;angry at Sierra, the victim of his mistake.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I do not get this. Surely he understands she did not shove herself down the<br/>
&gt;stairs?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Rachell, I&#39;d bet that, even if he did this in anger, his &quot;choice&quot; to <br/>
push Sierra was not a conscious, calculated one.  However, having met <br/>
Ren&#39;s fantastic kids, I&#39;d bet it was purely accidental, and that&#39;s <br/>
what I&#39;d always want to assume first, anyway.  I prefer to assume the <br/>
best in folks first, not the worst.  Also, we know from Ren&#39;s <br/>
telling, that he did not feel good about what had happened, that he <br/>
felt responsible--even at his tender age, and Ren&#39;s comforting him <br/>
was appropriate and had a good effect on all of them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I agree with showing compassion but I also think disapproval ought to be<br/>
&gt;shown. Like this is not ok. This is not what we do. Followed up by a<br/>
&gt;brief discussion of how to make better choices next time.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>See, but I think he was already aware of that.  Put yourself in his <br/>
shoes for a second.  Imagine that you made a mistake; let&#39;s say you <br/>
absentmindedly picked up a hot pot from the stove without a mitt and <br/>
you burned your hand.  Your husband walks in at the moment of the <br/>
burn and says, &quot;Rachell, you shouldn&#39;t pick up hot pots without a <br/>
mitt.&quot;  Did you really need him to tell you that?  How would that <br/>
make you feel?  I&#39;d probably want to slug him, myself.  True, in <br/>
*this* example, you&#39;ve hurt yourself.  But it would still apply if <br/>
you accidentally hurt somebody else, say you were distracted in the <br/>
supermarket and you bumped into an elderly lady in the aisle with <br/>
your cart and really hurt her.  Do you really need to hear your <br/>
husband saying, &quot;You should really watch where you&#39;re going; we don&#39;t <br/>
crash into people in the supermarket&quot;?  Again, I&#39;d have a hard time <br/>
not saying something utterly sarcastic and cutting to my <br/>
beloved!  I&#39;d do better with his compassion than his telling me <br/>
something I already knew.  I think Jalen already knew that <br/>
accidentally causing someone else to fall down the stairs is not the <br/>
thing to do, and he clearly already regretted it!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I must admit, this is exactly what I have been trying to accomplish as a<br/>
&gt;mother without even realizing there was a tape. No wonder it is taking all<br/>
&gt;this time, and offering a hug following a poor choice probably would have<br/>
&gt;been a few more years off! LOL. Seriously, I would like to hear the tape.<br/>

definitely loan it to you!<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;But life is both rewarding and punishing. For example, he may have been<br/>

&gt;before it comes to something like that?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would say that life has it&#39;s own *natural* rewards and <br/>
punishments.  I would like to help my son celebrate the natural <br/>
rewards he gets from life, and heal and learn and profit from the <br/>
natural punishments.  Creating artificial rewards and punishments <br/>
feels counterintuitive to me in our unschooling, life-learning world.  Ya know?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-461045259"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;You don&#39;t KNOW it wasn&#39;t an accident. I just left Ren&#39;s house. The <br/>
 </span></blockquote>stairs are in a funny place (IMO! &lt;g&gt;). Someone could easily have been <br/>
knocked down accidentally.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know anything at all.  I was not there and I was not any of the<br/>
parties involved.  I am simply referring to the story as Ren shared it.<br/>
<br/>
Please re-read what I said and you will see that I do not claim to KNOW<br/>
anything at all.  I said that the shoving seemed to be a deliberate choice<br/>
to put his hands on her.  I also said I am willing to believe he did not<br/>
intend to shove her down the stairs and that that part was an accident.  I<br/>
also said that I could see how his shoving her in the first place was a<br/>
mistake.  (By the way, Ren, please forgive me if it seems I am making your<br/>
poor Jalen out to be a monster, that is not my intention at all, I am merely<br/>
using your situation you shared as an example to illustrate my questions).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Plus, you&#39;re assuming the worst from the get-go. How about assuming <br/>
 </span></blockquote>the BEST?!<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure how I am supposed to assume a person putting their hands on<br/>
another person with force any differently that I am telling you.  This is<br/>
honestly how I feel.  I could lie in order to fall in line and be widely<br/>
accepted.  I am genuinely trying to understand  these notions.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;So you were angry with the victim FIRST?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And not AFTER the punishment?<br/>
<br/>
i was angry at them for whatever i was angry at them for initially, but not<br/>
for getting in trouble for hurting them.  Hurting them would have been my<br/>
choice and I felt I deserved punishment for it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Yet later in this post you DO say that *you* would have ranted and <br/>
 </span></blockquote>railed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes. I did post that later because I am being HONEST about me.  But what<br/>
does that have to do with anything?  Plenty of times people do NOT react<br/>
with a hug first, but also do NOT react with ranting or railing.  That was<br/>
my point.  In fact, most times I do not react first with ranting or railing<br/>
and many times in fact a hug is involved AFTERWARD.  In a situation such as<br/>
this I honestly could imagine myself ranting and railing just as Ren said<br/>
she did.  That was why my whole question came up in the first place.. Why<br/>
would we EXPECT ourselves to instinctively react with a hug?  (please do not<br/>
feel as if you need to re-explain this concept, I think I&#39;ve gotten it now,<br/>
I am just re-listing her for clarification&#39;s sake as some people seem to<br/>
think I am making hypocritical statements). <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;That&#39;s very typical parenting behavior---some would call it <br/>
 </span></blockquote>instinctive. :-(<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
An instinct is something you do without deliberating.  So for me in that<br/>
type of a case and for Ren in that one example and for many others all the<br/>
time it is called instinctive because it is.  I am not saying it is a happy<br/>
thing, or something to be proud of, or even something that can NEVER be<br/>
changed.  I am just arguing the fact that it is instinct.  Protect the weak,<br/>
defend the underdog, prosecute the perpetrator.  You do not have to agree<br/>
with me, I am only basing this on my realm of experience and do not claim<br/>
for it to be word of fact for all folks.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;We&#39;d just like for you to look at it in a different way. To see your <br/>
 </span></blockquote>child as doing his *best* at all times.<br/>
<br/>
but why do you think YOU do and *I* don&#39;t?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;So how do you think a better way to approach it would be?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hugs, maybe? &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hey, I like hugs!  As far as I can figure right now (subject to revision at<br/>
any time LOL) is that I would do my best to respond as calmly as possible,<br/>
apologize for the times I don&#39;t, discuss the situation either way and how it<br/>
does not make a person bad or good but how its all about choices and how<br/>
next time we need to have better choices prepared.  I would expect they<br/>
would apologize to the one they hurt just as I apologized to them for my<br/>
ranting (if I did indeed rant at that instance) and I would then be hit with<br/>
an INSTICT to hug.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Hugs FIRST!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then discussion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Again, I have NO PROBLEM with this.  I am merely admitting that it is not<br/>
instinct to me and I am not sure how to expect it to be.  Marji has given me<br/>
the best idea to consider thus far in that the more we consciously decide to<br/>
react in ta certain way (ex: hugs first) then the more possible it is that<br/>
this will EVENTUALLY become our typical response.  I see it as a habituated<br/>
response, not necessarily instinctive.. Then again, why is my instinctive<br/>
reaction the way it is now?  Is it truly all instinct or might be more<br/>
realistic to consider I have been habituated to react this way in the first<br/>
place.. Ooo the web gets complicated ;)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;No one here is saying *not* to discuss what happened and to talk about <br/>
 </span></blockquote>how Sierra was feeling. But Jalen was not trying to hurt Sierra. <br/>
Something got out of hand. I seriously doubt it was deliberate---and <br/>
it&#39;s best to *assume* that going in!<br/>
<br/>
again, please go back and read what I actually typed.  I never said I felt<br/>
he meant to hurt her deliberately.  What I did say is that he did seem to<br/>
make the conscious choice to put his hands on her.  Maybe it would help this<br/>
example to know why.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Would it have been better for *any* of us for her to have shamed him <br/>
 </span></blockquote>or punished him for accidently hurting Ben?<br/>
<br/>
ok, being totally honest again (and I can be because I have a wildish ds/8<br/>
who often plays a little too rough) this is how I probably would have<br/>
reacted:<br/>
<br/>
I would have asked for clarification of what happened.  Once it was clear it<br/>
was a total accident that occurred whilst rough housing I would have<br/>
reminded him to cool his jets a little and apologize to the one he<br/>
accidentally hurt.  That&#39;s it, no ranting, no railing and maybe no hugging<br/>
even.  Of course if he was frightened enough by something to come running to<br/>
me for a hug or security I would have happily provided that too, and then<br/>
followed up with clarification, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;He got consoled, he avoided Ben for an hour or so! &lt;G&gt;, and everything <br/>
 </span></blockquote>was fine in a bit.<br/>
<br/>
why did he need consolation? I want to make sure I understand. And as far as<br/>
avoiding Ben for an hour, I am sorry but I don&#39;t dig that.  He hurt Ben<br/>
albeit accidentally and I would have rather he apologized genuinely and then<br/>
interacted as normal.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Right---but it IS possible to make *better* responses each time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I never said differently :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;www.SandraDodd.com She&#39;ll tell you how to order.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Let&#39;s not look at it as being unkind. Let&#39;s look at it as an accident <br/>
 </span></blockquote>or as not having the tools or experience to make a better decision.<br/>
<br/>
ok, I guess I can&#39;t do that.  The shoving was not an accident.  Shoving is<br/>
unkind.  I agree with experience comes the possibility of making better<br/>
decisions but I do find it necessary to let them know right off that it is<br/>
not ok.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Right. *LIFE* is full of natural rewards and punishments. No need to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>make up your own. Make the situation better *now*, and he&#39;ll understand <br/>
the natural flow because it IS natural.<br/>
<br/>
what did I make up?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;So you would have ranted and railed. Just slowing down a millisecond <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and taking a deep breath can refocus and stop the yelling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I have already been learning this in my own life before this ever came<br/>
up here.  I guess that is why it made me ask Ren the question in the first<br/>
place.. If our first instinct is to react one way, how can we be<br/>
disappointed with ourselves for reacting according to instinct and not<br/>
according to our ideal, ie: a hug.  I guess this is a very timely topic for<br/>
me.  Maybe it is because i have steep stairs and fall from these could be<br/>
deadly, maybe I am misinterpreting the gravity of the potential injury, but<br/>
I honestly do think I would have yelled and I would have needed to calm<br/>
myself before even being able to talk to the pusher let alone hug them. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That being said, I am continuously trying to make kinder, gentler choices<br/>
all the time myself.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Both children were needy at that point. Unfortunately there aren&#39;t <br/>
 </span></blockquote>*two* of you. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, but physical injuries might require more immediate attention and I<br/>
would therefore do that first.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;But &quot;sending one off to think about what he did&quot; is not as good as <br/>
 </span></blockquote>saying, &quot;As soon as I take care of Sierra, I&#39;ll come see you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I would have more than likely (based on previous experiences) said something<br/>
like, &quot;X go to your room right now.  I want you to think about the choice<br/>
you just made and I will be in to talk to you once I know that Y is ok.&quot;<br/>
Sometimes X will ask immediately, &quot;May I please help you check Y and I would<br/>
say, of course.&quot;  And then we would Check Y together and set Y up with<br/>
something to occupy her/him whilst X and I have our talk.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&quot;Go away and think about what you&#39;ve done,&quot; is pretty creepy. I think <br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Maybe the *child* needs work controlling himself too? Jalen *is* only <br/>

<br/>
well obviously then yes.  I also thought he was older, I thought Ren said<br/>
her son was 15.  Maybe I am mixing up her clan. :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Breathe deeply FIRST before you say something you need to apologize <br/>
 </span></blockquote>for. It gets easier and easier. I promise.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Gosh I hope so.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Maybe the mom could do this too? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This mom ALWAYS does.  This mom is pretty quick like that ;)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;HOT button! Making someone apologize. Yuck!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t get this.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Sure. We understand. Most of us have been where you are. There IS a <br/>
 </span></blockquote>better way though.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, for me, I don&#39;t think I would change a thing except the<br/>
ranting/railing I freely admitted to and said I was not proud of.   I will<br/>
also try the hug firs thing more often, experiementally of course :-)<br/>
<br/>
Oh and the apology thing, non-negotiable for me.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;He wasn&#39;t really being mean or bad---he was not in control of himself <br/>
 </span></blockquote>because he was tired and hungry. In time, he will be better able to <br/>
know when he&#39;s getting crabby that he&#39;s hungry or tired or both. Maybe <br/>
let him know that could be *why* he was acting out. *Assume* he&#39;s doing <br/>
the best that he can at all times. It&#39;ll be better for your <br/>
relationship!<br/>
<br/>
see, I think that it is ok to have bad moments because you have reasons,<br/>
(hungry, tired, ill, bad day, etc.) but I really think it is unfair to treat<br/>
others unkindly because of it.  I am more apt to accept this sort of thing<br/>
from a toddler or young child who is still learning but as they get older I<br/>
have a harder time with it.  For example, it would have been harder for me<br/>
to just go and hug my ds/8 or my dd/12 if they were the ones swatting at<br/>
each other, I would have been like, &quot;um, excuse me.  I see that you are<br/>
tired and in disagreement but it is NOT ok to put your hands on one another&quot;<br/>
etc.  Does that make sense?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Kelly, I must say I really appreciate the time you and others have taken to<br/>
enlighten me.  I do not mean to seem resistant, I am just being very honest.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1345164879"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;***I have found that it is more helpful to provide information about <br/>
 </span></blockquote>the other person&#39;s experience, than to approve or disapprove of the <br/>
actions. I believe that children are inherently harmonious and <br/>
desire to be peaceful. There is a saying &#39;children hurt, when they <br/>
hurt&#39;. It seems to me to be more effective to discern the underlying <br/>
needs when someone strikes out, rather than punishing anyone for <br/>
having some unmet need that they didn&#39;t know how to meet in a more <br/>
constructive (less hurtful) manner. Facilitating a child with <br/>
information about the effect of one&#39;s actions by helping to create <br/>
awareness of the experience of others (concrete observations), and <br/>
trying to understand the child&#39;s needs, and supportively seeking <br/>
alternative means to meet their needs seems much more constructive <br/>
and portable to model than punishments. <br/>
<br/>
I could not agree with you more.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;But, punishments are much quicker external modifications of <br/>
 </span></blockquote>behavior. Unfortunately, they are not internally motivated <br/>
alterations in behavior; and therefore are not as effective when not <br/>
authoritatively imposed. However, the authoritative imposition of <br/>
punishments is NOT a very positive relationship building paradigm. <br/>
Nor does it make it easier to unschool as a trusted advisor.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think I agree with this for the most part as well, despite not being an<br/>
unschooler, but it does raise a few questions for me.<br/>
<br/>
To make it easy, I will limit it to:<br/>
<br/>
Do you never punish or never reward?<br/>
<br/>
If your child went above and beyond something for no reason would you not<br/>
recognize or reward that action?<br/>
<br/>
EX: after a stressful day, you come home to find your oldest child has taken<br/>
it upon themselves to do ALL the laundry, for no real reason other than to<br/>
be of help to you.  Would you not praise and thank her immensely and suggest<br/>
you 2 go to a movie together as a little gift to her? (NOT that you never<br/>
point out even little things they do with praise or that you never go to<br/>
movies together for no reason at all, because you do - this is just an<br/>
example).<br/>
<br/>
If your child deliberately ignored a responsibility, would you not punish<br/>
the child accordingly?<br/>
EX: your child&#39;s pet hamster died because they repeatedly neglected to<br/>
feed/water it.  Now they want another one.  Obviously the death of the<br/>
hamster was a natural consequence/punishment in and of itself but allowing<br/>
them to get another?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for entertaining my questions.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>immediately that he made a mistake and was shocked. I think there <br/>
might be more to discuss if a child did not realize this. Sometimes <br/>
children, esp. young ones, do not realize that they are hurting <br/>
someone else.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I only just realized how young Jalen is and for me age is a factor in my<br/>
tolerance with behaviors.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

impulses. Even at 11 years old, she cannot always see that her <br/>
actions are a choice. She very often acts before considering <br/>
consequences. Just telling someone that hitting or shoving is a bad <br/>
choice does not guarantee that it will never happen again. <br/>
 <br/>

oh I agree, Christy but I still feel it is vital to reiterate this whenever<br/>

<br/>
Melissa, I understand what you are saying about your child&#39;s special needs.<br/>
I would never even get verbal with someone else&#39;s child ever unless there<br/>
was direct danger involved and no parent around to intervene other than me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But as far as why not just skip the meanness, I was referring to the<br/>
INSTINCTIVE first reaction.  Sadly, sometimes it includes ranting/railing.<br/>
Obviously that is not preferable and in my case I do all I can to get a grip<br/>
over it, but I think it is important for folks to understand that it is not<br/>
as easy as &quot;just skipping&quot; it for all folks.<br/>

you burned your hand. Your husband walks in at the moment of the <br/>
burn and says, &quot;Rachell, you shouldn&#39;t pick up hot pots without a <br/>
mitt.&quot; Did you really need him to tell you that? How would that <br/>
make you feel? I&#39;d probably want to slug him, myself. True, in <br/>
*this* example, you&#39;ve hurt yourself. But it would still apply if <br/>
you accidentally hurt somebody else, say you were distracted in the <br/>
supermarket and you bumped into an elderly lady in the aisle with <br/>
your cart and really hurt her. Do you really need to hear your <br/>
husband saying, &quot;You should really watch where you&#39;re going; we don&#39;t <br/>

not saying something utterly sarcastic and cutting to my <br/>
beloved! I&#39;d do better with his compassion than his telling me <br/>
something I already knew.<br/>
<br/>
Well again, you are talking about adults who *ought* to know better but how<br/>

is our job as parents to help make sure the kiddos are getting the point.<br/>
<br/>

really, really enjoy, others of which we enjoy somewhat less but feel they<br/>
will provide benefit in the long run, ex: ds/8 and reading/writing.<br/>

if I had left it up to him totally he would still be thinking he &quot;hates&quot;<br/>

completely independent. Having the laundry done could create more <br/>

***Well, animal care in our home is a shared <br/>
responsibility/enjoyment. We all just contribute and discuss if the <br/>
care has been provided. Whoever gets up first (or goes to bed last) <br/>
lets the cats in/out and makes sure they have food and water. <br/>
Usually, that is dh. But, ds LOVES to do it and wants us to wait for <br/>
him to awaken. When dh is out of town, ds and I make sure that the <br/>
cats are in/out and fed. Same with the frogs, fish, snake, cat <br/>
litter, cleaning aquariums, plant care, etc. It isn&#39;t a chore. (We <br/>
don&#39;t have assigned &quot;chores&quot;.) Animal care is a joy. I guess we just <br/>
model that attitude and it is.<br/>
<br/>
Same with taking out the trash, doing the dishes, watering the <br/>
plants, getting the mail, doing the laundry, cleaning the kitchen, <br/>
cleaning the bathrooms, picking up toys, going grocery shopping, <br/>
etc. We do these activities joyfully for the benefit of our family, <br/>
together. Ds LOVES taking the trash can up and down the driveway, <br/>
helping to unload the dishwasher, &quot;washing&quot; dishes, watering the <br/>
plants, getting the mail, &quot;helping&quot; with the laundry, cleaning the <br/>
table and counters, setting the table, etc. Ds isn&#39;t keen on <br/>
cleaning the bathrooms (none of us are crazy about this); but we <br/>
make it fun. Dh likes it done more than I like to do it. So, dh <br/>
usually does it. And picking up toys isn&#39;t an issue for us. <br/>
Generally, I do it, because dh likes a path to walk in ds&#39;s room and <br/>
ds likes them organized. Dh or I do the grocery shopping alone <br/>
mostly. I LOVE to go alone or with a friend. Ds used to enjoy it, <br/>
and now he prefers to go with dh. We just do it without a struggle. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sounds to me like things have been working out nicely for you and <br/>
your young&#39;uns with your current homeschooling regimen.  I&#39;m just <br/>
curious to know (which, of course, you certainly don&#39;t have to <br/>
answer) what&#39;s moving you to check out an unschooling basics list.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt; Creating artificial rewards and punishments<br/>
 </span></blockquote>feels counterintuitive to me in our unschooling, life-learning world. Ya<br/>
know?&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the reason I said that was this, and I&#39;ll try to be brief <br/>
(&#39;cause I&#39;m *supposed* to be working!).  Folks who unschool glean <br/>
learning from the things they do in the real world.  My son loves to <br/>
play Yu-Gi-Oh duels, and he has learned to read and to calculate from <br/>
doing this and other things, too.  He has learned and is learning to <br/>
read and write because it&#39;s required of him so he can play World of <br/>
Warcraft.  He needs to ~ and wants to ~ know how to manage his money <br/>
so he can get the things he wants.  He gains musical (mathematical) <br/>
concepts because he likes to play the guitar.  He mastered telling <br/>
time because it became important to him to know what time it was so <br/>
he wouldn&#39;t miss a favorite TV show or he wanted to know how long <br/>
before a friend was coming over.  In the same way that my son learns <br/>
these things from doing what he loves and living his real life rather <br/>
than having lessons shoved down his throat (and I&#39;m not implying that <br/>
*you* shove lessons down your kids&#39; throats), he learns about life by <br/>
living it and interacting with other folks in a real way.  Of course, <br/>
I am with him through all this and we talk a lot about what goes on, <br/>
his impressions, my impressions, what&#39;s important, what&#39;s not, all <br/>
kinds of things that run the gamut from the mundane to the mystical <br/>
(and, I&#39;m not saying that only unschoolers do this, by the way; I&#39;m <br/>
sure you probably talk to your kids like this, too).  Anyway, I see <br/>
punishments and rewards as contrived much in the same way that math <br/>
worksheets and vocabulary/spelling lists are contrived.  I just <br/>
couldn&#39;t bring myself to impose punishments on him believing what I believe.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, my son, now 11 years old, is very polite, very <br/>
concerned about doing the right thing in the world, has no problems <br/>
taking responsibility for what he does, is very, very honest with me, <br/>
and is very loving and joyful.  He knows a lot of more conventionally <br/>
parented kids, and he is very aware that his life is quite different <br/>
from those of other kids he knows.  He expresses a great deal of <br/>
gratitude to me and to his dad.  He&#39;s not perfect, but neither am I, <br/>
of course, and we are both learning all the time together.  He&#39;s also <br/>
aware that not being perfect (he actually said this to me recently) <br/>
is a good position to be in because making mistakes is a great way to learn.<br/>
<br/>
Anway, I don&#39;t know if that clears things up or muddles them up more, <br/>
but I&#39;m tired and I really should be working now.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If your child deliberately ignored a responsibility, would you not punish<br/>

&gt;EX: your child&#39;s pet hamster died because they repeatedly neglected to<br/>
&gt;feed/water it. Now they want another one. Obviously the death of the<br/>
&gt;hamster was a natural consequence/punishment in and of itself but allowing<br/>
&gt;them to get another?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, this probably isn&#39;t a good example for me because I would not <br/>
permit an animal to die of neglect in my house!!!  I wouldn&#39;t heap <br/>
that kind of responsibility on any person who was not able to handle <br/>
it.  If he wanted to be the primary caregiver, I would be right there <br/>
with him, ready to support him in anyway I could.  As an adult, I <br/>
would ultimately assume the primary responsibility for any animal we <br/>
take in, as I do for our two kitty companions.  To me, animals are <br/>
not disposable educational tools.  They are living beings for whom I <br/>
have taken responsibility and I will not shirk on that by unloading <br/>
my responsibility onto someone who may or may not be ready for it.<br/>

<br/>
 I don&#39;t know anything at all. I was not there and I was not any of the<br/>
 parties involved. I am simply referring to the story as Ren shared it.<br/>
<br/>
 --=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 But we try to assume that it was an accident.<br/>
<br/>
  We don&#39;t really *know* either, but we&#39;ll respond as if it were an <br/>
accident.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
  I am not sure how I am supposed to assume a person putting their hands <br/>
on<br/>
  another person with force any differently that I am telling you. This <br/>
is<br/>
 honestly how I feel. I could lie in order to fall in line and be widely<br/>
 accepted. I am genuinely trying to understand these notions.<br/>
<br/>
 --=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  But if you assume it was accidental FIRST, then it&#39;s easier to respond <br/>
that way. If you assume it was deliberate, it can color how you react.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  i was angry at them for whatever i was angry at them for initially, <br/>
but not<br/>
  for getting in trouble for hurting them. Hurting them would have been <br/>
my<br/>
 choice and I felt I deserved punishment for it.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Why would you hurt someone by choice in the first place?<br/>
<br/>
  I think that would need to be explored first. Having never been hurt <br/>
by people who love him, why would a child choose to hurt another?<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Yes. I did post that later because I am being HONEST about me. But what<br/>
 does that have to do with anything? Plenty of times people do NOT react<br/>
  with a hug first, but also do NOT react with ranting or railing. That <br/>
was<br/>
  my point. In fact, most times I do not react first with ranting or <br/>
railing<br/>
  and many times in fact a hug is involved AFTERWARD. In a situation <br/>
such as<br/>
  this I honestly could imagine myself ranting and railing just as Ren <br/>
said<br/>
  she did. That was why my whole question came up in the first place.. <br/>
Why<br/>
  would we EXPECT ourselves to instinctively react with a hug? (please <br/>
do not<br/>
  feel as if you need to re-explain this concept, I think I&#39;ve gotten it <br/>
now,<br/>
  I am just re-listing her for clarification&#39;s sake as some people seem <br/>
to<br/>
 think I am making hypocritical statements).<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  But you could by-pass the ranting and railing and just start with the <br/>
hug. Why be mean if you will apologize later?<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=<br/>
<br/>
 An instinct is something you do without deliberating. So for me in that<br/>
  type of a case and for Ren in that one example and for many others all <br/>
the<br/>
  time it is called instinctive because it is. I am not saying it is a <br/>
happy<br/>
 thing, or something to be proud of, or even something that can NEVER be<br/>
  changed. I am just arguing the fact that it is instinct. Protect the <br/>
weak,<br/>
  defend the underdog, prosecute the perpetrator. You do not have to <br/>
agree<br/>
  with me, I am only basing this on my realm of experience and do not <br/>
claim<br/>
 for it to be word of fact for all folks.<br/>
<br/>
 --=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  This is typical parenting. There *is* a better way. I think we can <br/>
protect the weak and defend the underdog without &quot;persecuting he <br/>
perpetrator.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;We&#39;d just like for you to look at it in a different way. To see your<br/>
 </span></blockquote> child as doing his *best* at all times.<br/>
<br/>
 but why do you think YOU do and *I* don&#39;t?<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Because you refer to him as a &quot;perpetrator&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Again, I have NO PROBLEM with this. I am merely admitting that it is <br/>
not<br/>
  instinct to me and I am not sure how to expect it to be. Marji has <br/>
given me<br/>
  the best idea to consider thus far in that the more we consciously <br/>
decide to<br/>
  react in ta certain way (ex: hugs first) then the more possible it is <br/>
that<br/>
  this will EVENTUALLY become our typical response. I see it as a <br/>
habituated<br/>
  response, not necessarily instinctive.. Then again, why is my <br/>
instinctive<br/>
 reaction the way it is now? Is it truly all instinct or might be more<br/>
  realistic to consider I have been habituated to react this way in the <br/>
first<br/>
 place.. Ooo the web gets complicated ;)<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Right. The more you *do* it, the easier---and almost second <br/>
nature---it becomes.<br/>
<br/>
  You may be thinking that we all started out his way. For *many* of us, <br/>
it&#39;s been a long, long process. Having been spanked as a child, my <br/>
first response is to smack. It took a LOT to keep my hand stuck to my <br/>
*own* leg and just yell. Then I quit yelling and just shook. &lt;g&gt; Duncan <br/>
asked that I quit shaking! &lt;G&gt; Now I just take a deep breath. Works <br/>
wonders!<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;He got consoled, he avoided Ben for an hour or so! &lt;G&gt;, and <br/>
 </span></blockquote>everything<br/>
 was fine in a bit.<br/>
<br/>
  why did he need consolation? I want to make sure I understand. And as <br/>
far as<br/>
 avoiding Ben for an hour, I am sorry but I don&#39;t dig that. He hurt Ben<br/>
  albeit accidentally and I would have rather he apologized genuinely <br/>
and then<br/>
 interacted as normal.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Because he was sorry he hit Ben? He&#39;s only five. Overwhelmed?<br/>
<br/>
 You can&#39;t *make* someone apologize genuinely.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;Let&#39;s not look at it as being unkind. Let&#39;s look at it as an accident<br/>
 </span></blockquote> or as not having the tools or experience to make a better decision.<br/>
<br/>
  ok, I guess I can&#39;t do that. The shoving was not an accident. Shoving <br/>
is<br/>
 unkind. I agree with experience comes the possibility of making better<br/>
  decisions but I do find it necessary to let them know right off that <br/>
it is<br/>
 not ok.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  OK---You *are* assuming the worst---that the shoving was not an <br/>
accident.<br/>
<br/>
 He already knew it was not OK.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;Right. *LIFE* is full of natural rewards and punishments. No need to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  make up your own. Make the situation better *now*, and he&#39;ll <br/>
understand<br/>
 the natural flow because it IS natural.<br/>
<br/>
 what did I make up?<br/>
<br/>
 -==-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Punishments. The natural punishment is that he feels bad for what <br/>
happened. Losing his video game or his favorite toy or being sent to <br/>
his room for time-out or yelled at for causing someone hurt---those are <br/>
punishments imposed by someone else.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Yes, I have already been learning this in my own life before this ever <br/>
came<br/>
  up here. I guess that is why it made me ask Ren the question in the <br/>
first<br/>
 place.. If our first instinct is to react one way, how can we be<br/>
 disappointed with ourselves for reacting according to instinct and not<br/>
  according to our ideal, ie: a hug. I guess this is a very timely topic <br/>
for<br/>
  me. Maybe it is because i have steep stairs and fall from these could <br/>
be<br/>
  deadly, maybe I am misinterpreting the gravity of the potential <br/>
injury, but<br/>
 I honestly do think I would have yelled and I would have needed to calm<br/>
  myself before even being able to talk to the pusher let alone hug <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  And maybe we would too. But we really work at being more mindful and <br/>
thinking that our children are working hard at being GOOD.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Yes, but physical injuries might require more immediate attention and I<br/>
 would therefore do that first.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
  -And we would too. And Ren did. But she went to Jalen as soon as she <br/>
knew Sierra was OK to make sure Jalen was OK.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  I would have more than likely (based on previous experiences) said <br/>
something<br/>
  like, &quot;X go to your room right now. I want you to think about the <br/>
choice<br/>
  you just made and I will be in to talk to you once I know that Y is <br/>
ok.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 And your tone...?<br/>
<br/>
 That seems really harsh.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  ok so now I am creepy.let&#39;s start a list :-) .for the record I never <br/>
said<br/>
 &quot;go away&quot;<br/>
 -=-=--=-<br/>
<br/>
 What you said was creepy.<br/>
<br/>
  I said, &quot;Go away.&quot; You just said, &quot;Go to your room.&quot; A person&#39;s room <br/>
should be a safe place, not a place of punishment or to &quot;think about <br/>
it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;HOT button! Making someone apologize. Yuck!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote> I don&#39;t get this.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Making someone apologize doesn&#39;t make a person apologetic. It&#39;s a <br/>
power thing. If a child *is* sorry, he&#39;ll say it---if you model it for <br/>
him. If you make him, he&#39;s just parroting the words. Or he apologizes <br/>
to keep from getting in trouble.<br/>
<br/>
 What would happen if your son did not apologize when you told him to?<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Honestly, for me, I don&#39;t think I would change a thing except the<br/>
 ranting/railing I freely admitted to and said I was not proud of.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Stick around! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Many people think that being a better parent than the one they had is <br/>
the best they can be. I&#39;ve been a better parent than either of mine for <br/>
quite a while now. I think I can be better than I am *now*. I keep <br/>
working at it.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Oh and the apology thing, non-negotiable for me.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 This could be it&#39;s own thread, all by its lonesome.<br/>
<br/>
 Why is an apology a must for you?<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  see, I think that it is ok to have bad moments because you have <br/>
reasons,<br/>
  (hungry, tired, ill, bad day, etc.) but I really think it is unfair to <br/>
treat<br/>
 others unkindly because of it.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Let&#39;s turn it around and see it from the other direction: I think it&#39;s <br/>
unfair to be treated unkindly because you&#39;re having a bad moment due to <br/>
being hungry, ill, tired. *Especially* if you&#39;re a young child.<br/>
<br/>
 Model kindness and generosity; the child will follow suit.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I am more apt to accept this sort of thing<br/>
  from a toddler or young child who is still learning but as they get <br/>
older I<br/>
  have a harder time with it. For example, it would have been harder for <br/>
me<br/>
  to just go and hug my ds/8 or my dd/12 if they were the ones swatting <br/>
at<br/>
 each other, I would have been like, &quot;um, excuse me. I see that you are<br/>
  tired and in disagreement but it is NOT ok to put your hands on one <br/>
another&quot;<br/>
 etc. Does that make sense?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Well, we&#39;ve been talking about a five year old.<br/>
<br/>
 But if treated kindly, he will grow into a kinder teen and adult.<br/>
<br/>
  And why are your kids swatting each other? What&#39;s the underlying <br/>
reason? Take care of *that* first.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Kelly, I must say I really appreciate the time you and others have <br/>
taken to<br/>
  enlighten me. I do not mean to seem resistant, I am just being very <br/>
honest.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  We know. And even Ren seemed really resistant to all of this several <br/>
years ago, &lt;bwg&gt; People change and grow.<br/>
<br/>
  Just don&#39;t think you&#39;ll stay where you are if you keep reading here! <br/>
&lt;G&gt; You may even let go of the forced apologies! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

But as far as why not just skip the meanness, I was referring to the<br/>
INSTINCTIVE first reaction.  Sadly, sometimes it includes <br/>
ranting/railing.<br/>
Obviously that is not preferable and in my case I do all I can to get a <br/>
grip<br/>
over it, but I think it is important for folks to understand that it is <br/>
not<br/>
as easy as &quot;just skipping&quot; it for all folks.<br/>
<br/>
-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
No, it&#39;s not easy. For *most* folks. Many of us still struggle.<br/>
<br/>
But we can *choose* to do better and be better. Each moment. Each day.<br/>

  Well again, you are talking about adults who *ought* to know better <br/>
but how<br/>
  mant times do adults even need help seeing right from wrong? I think <br/>
this<br/>
  is our job as parents to help make sure the kiddos are getting the <br/>
point.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  So if traditional parenting works (rewards, punishments, forced <br/>
apologies), why *do* so many adults need help seeing right from wrong? <br/>
Didn&#39;t their parents make their points?<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  I really *don&#39;t* know as I am not an unschooler and now I am not so <br/>
sure I<br/>
 would make a good one anyway.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
 Well, the good part is that you&#39;re still questioning! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Actually, I have found him many times now hidden under the blankets at <br/>
night<br/>
 with a flashlight reading his favorite books,<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=--=<br/>
<br/>
 Why does he need to hide that he&#39;s reading?<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 this is a real change for him<br/>
  and I attribute it to my perseverance in trying all kinds of new books <br/>
until<br/>
  I found some that he could latch onto and find a liking for. I am <br/>
confident<br/>
  if I had left it up to him totally he would still be thinking he <br/>
&quot;hates&quot;<br/>
 reading.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Again, you&#39;re thinking the worst. Can you even imagine that he would <br/>
have discovered how wonderful books are all by himself?<br/>
<br/>
  Did your perseverance also enable him to walk and talk? He really is <br/>
capable. It&#39;s good to think of him that way.<br/>

 To make it easy, I will limit it to:<br/>
<br/>
 Do you never punish or never reward?<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Nope. Never.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  If your child went above and beyond something for no reason would you <br/>
not<br/>
 recognize or reward that action?<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  I would certainly be appreciative. But I&#39;m guessing they would do <br/>
things for actual reasons. that&#39;s a big part of being mindful. they <br/>
don&#39;t do things &quot;for no reason&quot; to get something in exchange. They do <br/>
things because it would be nice.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  EX: after a stressful day, you come home to find your oldest child has <br/>
taken<br/>
  it upon themselves to do ALL the laundry, for no real reason other <br/>
than to<br/>
  be of help to you. Would you not praise and thank her immensely and <br/>
suggest<br/>
  you 2 go to a movie together as a little gift to her? (NOT that you <br/>
never<br/>
  point out even little things they do with praise or that you never go <br/>
to<br/>
 movies together for no reason at all, because you do - this is just an<br/>
 example).<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  This happens a lot--the laundry or the dishes or cleaning the den or <br/>
kitchen. Cameron&#39;s very kind, generous, and helpful.<br/>
<br/>
 I would and DO thank him. But I wouldn&#39;t go to a movie to reward him.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  If your child deliberately ignored a responsibility, would you not <br/>
punish<br/>
 the child accordingly?<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 We do NOT punish. And he has no imposed responsibilities.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 EX: your child&#39;s pet hamster died because they repeatedly neglected to<br/>
 feed/water it. Now they want another one. Obviously the death of the<br/>
  hamster was a natural consequence/punishment in and of itself but <br/>

 OH MY GOD! An animal DIES because of neglect???<br/>
<br/>
  That&#39;s not the child&#39;s problem. It&#39;s the parent&#39;s responsibility to <br/>

  School&#39;s goal is to prepare them to be anything they want. But the <br/>
process is so dullifying and kids haven&#39;t explored the possibilities of <br/>
what they could be that many set their sites as low as possible. They <br/>
go to college to get a job to buy stuff. ~Joyce Fetteroll<br/>
