My dh gets annoyed about the house being a mess from time to time <br/>
(although it has improved in recent months), the dishes are often <br/>
something that bugs him too, and the clutter.   I only have one (dd <br/>
14) who sleeps past noon, so I have more free time.  I find if I at <br/>
least get the dishes done and removed clutter, often right before he <br/>
comes home, making it appear cleaner and neater there are fewer <br/>
comments.   It&#39;s important for him to feel his &quot;needs&quot; are being met <br/>
too!<br/>

<br/>
  I&#39;ve been absent for a while. I figured I&#39;d tackle an easy one first! <br/>
&lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  A few things: Everyone thinks Ben has always gotten unschooling. We <br/>
were *both* new only six years ago, and Ben had some of these same <br/>
issues. We&#39;ve about worked through them.<br/>
<br/>
 If we&#39;re HOMEschooling and HOME all day, why isn&#39;t the house clean?<br/>
<br/>
  Uh...because we&#39;re HOME DOing things? And because we&#39;re NOT home doing <br/>
OTHER things. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Days we&#39;re home, we&#39;re usually doing all sorts of <br/>
crafts/cooking/writing/playing/DOing---busybusybusy! The house gets <br/>
trashed when we&#39;re home. I can&#39;t make a mess AND clean at the same <br/>
time. How many hours are there in a day?<br/>
<br/>
  Sometimes we have days that we&#39;re all flying out of the house. We <br/>
leave it a wreck, because we can&#39;t tackle anything before we leave. <br/>
Then we don&#39;t get home until *after* Ben gets home---no time to pick up <br/>
before supper&#39;s due.<br/>
<br/>
  One of the big lightbulbs for Ben was learning (really thinking about <br/>
the fact) that each of us is responsible for our feelings about mess. <br/>
If a clean toilet *matters* to you, go clean the damned toilet. Don&#39;t <br/>
bitch at someone ELSE to do it. If (in *your* opinion) the dishes <br/>
*must* be cleaned, pick up a sponge and get washing! If (*you* feel) <br/>
the floor needs vacuuming, well..... The things that bother us should <br/>
bother *us* enough to do something about them *ourselves*.<br/>
<br/>
  On the *other* hand: I would ask him what TWO things really, really <br/>
bother him. What TWO things could *I* do that would make a difference <br/>
to him on a daily basis. 1) clean house and 2) clean yard would NOT <br/>
qualify! &lt;G&gt; But if having my &quot;piles&quot; picked up or having the beds made <br/>
or having the dishes washed or having the den straightened would make <br/>
*Ben* happy to walk through the door, I would make sure THOSE TWO <br/>
things are done each day. And DON&#39;T do them so he won&#39;t yell when he <br/>
walks through the door. DO them because it makes him happy! Because it <br/>
makes a difference in his life. Change the dynamics in the house!<br/>
<br/>
  Something to keep in mind is that we need to treat our husbands as <br/>
nicely as we treat our kids. We also need to remember that our husbands <br/>
are *ALSO* doing the best they can with the tools that they have right <br/>
now! Maybe Ken has very few tools. Help him acquire new ones. Helpful, <br/>
useful ones. Yelling ISN&#39;T helpful or useful! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  These dads (mostly the dads---Deb R&#39;s her family&#39;s breadwinner!) are <br/>
the ones that make this unschooling lifestyle we love so much even <br/>
remotely possible. Without their continued support, we couldn&#39;t DO <br/>
this! Taking a bit more care to make *his* life as special as you can <br/>
will make him feel welcome and special in his own home. I&#39;d put as much <br/>
effort into that as possible. Ask the girls for their help too. The <br/>
better HE is treated, the better HE will respond. Make him *want* to <br/>
come home!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1882112801">I don&#39;t like to live in clutter and I have allergies so I don&#39;t let <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-809890795">We are on the paper plate plan over here (paper plates, cups, utensils, etc.).  Then all I have to do is run a load of pots and pans through the dishwasher about every other day.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1938757482">I have to second this suggestion. I am not one who enjoys housework and I&#39;m<br/>
not bothered much by mess and clutter. Dh is bothered a lot more. It was a<br/>
major source of conflict when the kids were small (this was before we were<br/>
unschooling so I can&#39;t blame it on that!).  Interestingly enough, as I&#39;ve<br/>
embraced unschooling more, I&#39;ve become more willing to meet him part way on<br/>
this. His two things that matter is a made bed and clean socks and underwear<br/>
in his drawer. I could care less if my bed is made....but it only takes me 1<br/>
minute to make the bed each day. Throwing a load of clothes in the wash also<br/>
is quick. If these two things are done, he can tolerate a lot more mess. If<br/>
they&#39;re not done, everything else seems worse to him.  And it&#39;s not just<br/>
him. My daughter hates a messy kitchen. I&#39;m the one that gets griped at for<br/>
not rinsing my dishes or not cleaning up my messes. But because it matters<br/>
to her, I try to be a little more attentive to the condition of the kitchen.<br/>
She has taken on the kitchen as her job to do and she will give it a good<br/>
cleaning every day or two. In spite of my tolerance of mess and clutter, I<br/>
really can&#39;t stand a dirty bathroom. So I make sure it gets cleaned. I don&#39;t<br/>
worry about any one else doing it.   As we&#39;ve grown more and more into<br/>
unschooling and as the kids have gotten older,  we all find our little<br/>
things we like to do and together, the house stays reasonably clean. Once dh<br/>
stopped getting annoyed with the condition of the house and making it an<br/>
issue, I became much more willing to help keep it picked up. The kids are<br/>
all very good about helping out and they all keep their rooms cleaner than I<br/>
do.<br/>

How do  you balance the two? After a few years of unschooling, it is<br/>

 <br/>
If it were me, I would sit down with dh and really talk with him and  listen <br/>
to him.  Find out what it is about the cleanliness of the house he  likes.  <br/>
Maybe it makes him feel secure and loved for some reason.  I  would also explain <br/>
that I *do* want him to come home to what he perceives  as  a loving <br/>
environment and if that means that there are certain things he  likes especially to <br/>
see clean I will make those a priority.  Like if he  hated seeing dirty dishes <br/>
in the sink I might do that rather than change or make  the bed, or use more <br/>
paper plates so that dirty dishes aren&#39;t an issue.  If  he can prioritize what <br/>
it is he likes to see &quot;clean&quot; it might help.  What  it is that helps him come <br/>
home and relax.  <br/>
 <br/>
Also I would sit down with the children and explain that  about 20 minutes <br/>
before dad comes home you would like to have that time to just  clean those <br/>
things that are important to dad.  Just as there are certain  things that make the <br/>
kids or myself feel loved, there are things that make dad  feel loved.  They <br/>
might even be willing to help you with the cleaning,  although the 3 year old <br/>
might be limited, the almost 8 year old could do  more.  Not that they have <br/>
to, but if they know it will help dad come home  and feel at ease and relaxed, <br/>
more ready to be present with them, they might be  happy to help.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1578394861">I wanted to second that...we&#39;ve always had the habit of doing a  <br/>
little tidy up right before dad gets home. It&#39;s not a big deal, I  <br/>
just say how I like to do a little tidy as a present to dad, who&#39;s  <br/>
worked really hard all day. They usually love to join in, although  <br/>
lately Emily has gotten grumpy if Josh chooses not to help. We all do  <br/>
a little at a time, at our house, just putting your dishes in the  <br/>
dishwasher after a meal makes a big difference, as you can imagine  <br/>
with nine people that&#39;s a lot of dishes to do by yourself AND it&#39;s  <br/>
overwhelming to see in a sink. We also have to be careful because  <br/>
Avari is so small, so chokehazards can&#39;t get left out, but they don&#39;t  <br/>
mind cleaning as a gift to Avari for her freedom. ;-) Otherwise she&#39;s  <br/>
in the sling all the time to keep her off the floor.<br/>
<br/>
Also wanted to say that a supported three year old can do a lot more  <br/>
than most imagine. Dan loves to wash dishes by hand, and if I draw up  <br/>
a sink of water, he&#39;ll do most of them, fairly well. Even if he gets  <br/>
bored, as Kelly said, soaking helps it go faster if I get some time  <br/>
to myself (ha! like that happens). When Josh was very small and I was  <br/>
pregnant, he wanted to help in the worst way, so he would clean with  <br/>
baby wipes, and love it. SO all of our kids have joined in cleaning  <br/>
with wipies, and as they got older begged to use sprayers and towels  <br/>
rather than wipies. Lots of baskets to put clothes and toys in, every  <br/>
room in our house has baskets, even though the same stuff is out,  <br/>
being contained makes a big difference and takes so little of my  <br/>
time, usually two minutes when I&#39;m on the way to the bathroom or to  <br/>
get a drink of water.<br/>
<br/>
And now I gotta go. HTH<br/>

&gt; Also I would sit down with the children and explain that about 20  <br/>
&gt; minutes<br/>
&gt; before dad comes home you would like to have that time to just  <br/>
&gt; clean those<br/>
&gt; things that are important to dad. Just as there are certain things  <br/>
&gt; that make the<br/>
&gt; kids or myself feel loved, there are things that make dad feel  <br/>
&gt; loved. They<br/>
&gt; might even be willing to help you with the cleaning, although the 3  <br/>
&gt; year old<br/>
&gt; might be limited, the almost 8 year old could do more. Not that  <br/>
&gt; they have<br/>
&gt; to, but if they know it will help dad come home and feel at ease  <br/>
&gt; and relaxed,<br/>
&gt; more ready to be present with them, they might be happy to help.<br/>

off your priority list. It&#39;s gotta sting.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe make a half hour before he gets home &quot;his&quot; time. Tell the kids  <br/>
you want to give Daddy a gift of a clean sink because it makes him  <br/>
smile. Ask them to join you but accept no as an answer. It will help  <br/>
a lot to see it as a gift rather than a chore that  he&#39;s &quot;making&quot; you  <br/>
do.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Here is how I see it.  Houses are likes works of Art.  There are those <br/>
pieces of Art where someone has thrown a mess of paint on a canvas and <br/>
then there are those pieces of art whose paintings are quite neat and <br/>
you can tell what it is.  It is all considered art and beautiful in <br/>
many different eyes.<br/>
<br/>
So there are &quot;messy&quot; houses and &quot;neat&quot; houses.  They are all a work of <br/>
art.  It takes time to get them both to where they are, neat or messy.<br/>
<br/>
So just tell your husband that he is coming home to a work of art and <br/>
it took a long time to paint it that way.  Maybe he sees the other side <br/>
of art and that is where you meet in the middle to make a painting the <br/>
both of you can call your own and get back to enjoying life and each <br/>
other.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1798332478">Has anyone seen &quot;Little Miss Sunshine&quot;? I found a lot of it very unschooly <br/>
(in a whole-life way but not necessarily an educational way) and it was just <br/>
a joy to experience. If you are lucky enough to make it out to a movie <br/>
anytime soon I think it will be worth your time. It might even be a good way <br/>
to start to influence a reluctant spouse toward the whole life unschooling. <br/>
There&#39;s a lot in there about letting go of different controls as well as the <br/>
&quot;journey&quot; being just as important - if not more important - than the <br/>
destination.<br/>
<br/>
Or, maybe it was just the head space I was in when I saw it... you all might <br/>
feel differently about it!<br/>
