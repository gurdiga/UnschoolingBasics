<div id="ygrps-yiv-831021802">Hi Christi-<br/>
The fancy answer for kids who like to bite and have things in their  mouths <br/>
is that they have &quot;sensory needs&quot; and to give them other outlets for the  <br/>
biting.  Others have mentioned gum (they obviously have to be old enough  not to <br/>
choke on it), twizzlers, pacifiers, straws, chew toys for babies, or  anything <br/>
that is hard enough to chew on.  Therapists often use rubber (some  kind of <br/>
plastic) tubing that kids can chew on and wear around their necks if  they want <br/>
as a necklace.  My daughter likes to chew on the edges of her  &quot;security&quot;pillow <br/>
and has almost chewed thru several.  Some kids also like  to just have <br/>
something in their mouth more often- here, have a carrot.<br/>
When they get older- they chew the tops of their pens!<br/>
And of course, also the dialogue about &quot;biting hurts, etc.&quot;  but if  they <br/>
aren&#39;t biting out of delight or malice, they are propbably just needing  more <br/>
oral stimulation than average.<br/>
good luck,<br/>
