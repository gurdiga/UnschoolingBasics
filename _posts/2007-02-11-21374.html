<div id="ygrps-yiv-1191158303">I have a new problem that I hope you all will be able to offer <br/>
suggestions for.<br/>
<br/>
My DS (10yo) is not eating regularly.  We&#39;ve already ruled <br/>
out...sickness and emotional problems.  And we know that boys <br/>
sometimes loose their appetites while they are &quot;in&quot; a growth spurt.  <br/>
He is a skinny boy...slim-fits tend to need belts...I&#39;m not really <br/>
concerned with weight gain becasue he could probably use it.  So <br/>
these things are not really of concern.  I am concerned that he will <br/>
develop a bad habit and/or that it will become unhealthy but that is <br/>
pretty low on my &quot;worry scale&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
Alex will go almost the whole day without eating anything <br/>
(literally), and then be starving by dinner.  I am all for letting <br/>
him choose for himself what and when to eat.  We have always given <br/>
free-reign of the kitchen and everything in it.  If the kids are <br/>
hungry all they have to do is go get it or ask for it to be made or <br/>
if they can cook it now that they are old enough.  <br/>
<br/>
When others are eating we always consider the other members and ask <br/>
if they would like some too.  Even when he&#39;s been playing hard and <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to stop to eat, I&#39;ll remind him that there is food on <br/>
the table/stove when he&#39;s ready for a break...sometimes I&#39;ll just <br/>
bring it to him.  So it&#39;s not a lack of food or lack of opportunity <br/>
thing either.<br/>
<br/>
But lately, even if I bring it to him...he won&#39;t eat.  He may eat <br/>
two or three bites then the rest is left on the counter or thrown <br/>
away.  He&#39;ll say he&#39;s just not hungry.  Usually, that wouldn&#39;t <br/>
bother me...  <br/>
<br/>
However, what has become the problem is that he is <br/>
constantly &quot;crashing&quot;.  We do know this IS the underlying problem.  <br/>
Which leads him to be irritable and cranky.  Not that our family is <br/>
without it&#39;s fusses.  We&#39;re not totally RU yet...kids are 13 & <br/>
10...we&#39;re having to break A LOT of bad habits in all of us.  But it <br/>
certainly adds to the heat.<br/>
<br/>
When he does eat, he&#39;s like a shark at a feeding frenzy...trance <br/>
like and barely comes up for air.  He acts like he&#39;s in an eating <br/>
race/competition or like his food is going to be taken away which <br/>
has never happened, I might add.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess what I need help with is: How do we address his physical <br/>
NEED to eat versus his &quot;don&#39;t want to/not hungry&quot;?  <br/>
<br/>
We have discussed with him how bodies react to food/lack of food and <br/>
how he&#39;s running out of &quot;fuel&quot;.  We&#39;ve offered special foods/meals, <br/>
different times, keeping extra convenience foods, bringing food to <br/>
him, offering several smaller meals/snacks during the day, etc.  But <br/>
he still just &quot;doesn&#39;t&quot; eat until it&#39;s TOO late.  I don&#39;t want to <br/>
make him eat if he really doesn&#39;t want to...I lived through &quot;you&#39;re <br/>
not done until your plate is clean&quot; era and have no desire to to <br/>
that to my kids...but it&#39;s a he NEEDS to.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve wondered if he doesn&#39;t feel/notice hunger pains or if he just <br/>
ingnores them because he doen&#39;t want to interrupt what he&#39;s <br/>
doing...??  <br/>
<br/>
BTW, this has been going on for over a month now...much longer than <br/>
any other time he&#39;s lost his appetite.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any ideas...<br/>

My name is Heather and I have a 7yo just like this. He will eat breakfast then when lunch comes around &quot;I&#39;am not hungry&quot;<br/>
Then at supper he is starving and crashing. Just thought that I would share this with you. I will email you later when I have more time to talk. <br/>

<br/>
When I read this I first thought &quot;be proactive and have food<br/>
available&quot; but later in your post it sounds like you might be doing<br/>
some of that. Instead of just offering him what is cooking, do you<br/>
have platters of food that is ready-to-eat available? I find that if I<br/>
provide food that doesn&#39;t need any preparation, we tend to munch on it<br/>
all day...a healthier way to eat anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Would he enjoy being a participant in meal planning, grocery shopping<br/>
etc?? Maybe if he had more control over the prep end of things he<br/>
might be able to offer more clues about what he wants available?<br/>
<br/>
What about protein shakes? Those are easy to drink while you&#39;re doing<br/>
other things and it would supplement his sporadic appetite until this<br/>
passes. Get him a good multi-vitamin and try to keep trusting him. If<br/>
you&#39;ve ruled out physical or emotional issues, then the only thing<br/>
left is growth and time in my opinion.:)<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s the problem with mealtimes. People aren&#39;t all hungry at the<br/>
same times, especially children whose metabolisms are very different<br/>
from our own. Having food readily available to snack on is so<br/>
important for growing children and gives them the opportunity to keep<br/>
trusting their own hunger signals.<br/>

there are also temperature issues. She doesn&#39;t actively complain, <br/>

<br/>
For some, not all.  I find that if I give my stomach a break between<br/>
eating, allowing it to digest and sit empty for a while, I feel better<br/>
and have more energy, and need less sleep.  <br/>

Every body is different, the key is to learn to listen to your self,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-177364355">We have tons of convenient &quot;simple/non-prep&quot; stuff like protein bars, <br/>
granola, fruits, veggies, popcorn, cereals, yogurts, cheeses, <br/>
boiled/deviled eggs (his favorite) and chips/salsa, etc.  I try to <br/>
have the veggies and fruit already bite sized and keep plenty of <br/>
dips/dressings handy.  I haven&#39;t given the &quot;icky&quot; idea much <br/>
thought...I&#39;ll ask to see if that is an issue. <br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t really thought about protein shakes. I have thought about <br/>
smoothies since when he does drink it&#39;s mostly juices.  He doesn&#39;t <br/>
care for water and has recently steered away from milk.  But he almost <br/>
always drinks Gatorade or Sprite when we&#39;re out.<br/>
<br/>
His sister loves to be in the kitchen and make biscuts, mini-pizzas, <br/>
cookies, and muffins for everyone to share.  He however, only gets <br/>
involved if it is one of his favorite foods (spagetti, potatoe salad, <br/>
stroganoff).<br/>
<br/>
He sometimes makes requests for specific things from/at the grocery <br/>
store but doesn&#39;t seem to have an interest in helping do the <br/>
shopping.  When someone wants to make a meal, we usually ask if there <br/>
is something perticular that anyone wants.  So he gets plenty of input <br/>
of what he would like to eat and usually we can accomodate...even if <br/>
it is something totally different from what everyone else is eating.<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, we&#39;ve thought that we have made as many choices as we can <br/>
availible to him regarding eating...we&#39;re running out of ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the input.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-104194806">Hi Julie,<br/>
The doctor suggested that we put our son on Pedisure. Well he is finally drinking them. I get the Kroger brand for about 6.99 for a six pack and they have three flavors. He really likes it. He favors the vanilla kind though. Sometimes he will drink two a day and I noticed that he is finally gaining some weight. He finally reached 40 pounds and we shouted for joy! He just turned seven. I try to get him to eat a lot of protein during the day or around supper. He needs to gain some weight. The doctor said he was okay but I think he needs some weight. Oh well......I just thought that I would put my two cents in. <br/>

            We have tons of convenient &quot;simple/non- prep&quot; stuff like protein bars, <br/>
<br/>
granola, fruits, veggies, popcorn, cereals, yogurts, cheeses, <br/>
<br/>
boiled/deviled eggs (his favorite) and chips/salsa, etc.  I try to <br/>
<br/>
have the veggies and fruit already bite sized and keep plenty of <br/>
<br/>
dips/dressings handy.  I haven&#39;t given the &quot;icky&quot; idea much <br/>
<br/>
thought...I&#39; ll ask to see if that is an issue. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t really thought about protein shakes. I have thought about <br/>
<br/>
smoothies since when he does drink it&#39;s mostly juices.  He doesn&#39;t <br/>
<br/>
care for water and has recently steered away from milk.  But he almost <br/>
<br/>
always drinks Gatorade or Sprite when we&#39;re out.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
His sister loves to be in the kitchen and make biscuts, mini-pizzas, <br/>
<br/>
cookies, and muffins for everyone to share.  He however, only gets <br/>
<br/>
involved if it is one of his favorite foods (spagetti, potatoe salad, <br/>
<br/>
stroganoff).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He sometimes makes requests for specific things from/at the grocery <br/>
<br/>
store but doesn&#39;t seem to have an interest in helping do the <br/>
<br/>
shopping.  When someone wants to make a meal, we usually ask if there <br/>
<br/>
is something perticular that anyone wants.  So he gets plenty of input <br/>
<br/>
of what he would like to eat and usually we can accomodate.. .even if <br/>
<br/>
it is something totally different from what everyone else is eating.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, we&#39;ve thought that we have made as many choices as we can <br/>
<br/>
availible to him regarding eating...we&#39; re running out of ideas.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the input.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-136826754">Hi, I&#39;m new to the group! My name is Christy and I have a 9 year old son and 12 year old daughter. <br/>
   <br/>
  My son is very much like yours in that matter. He has been that way almost all of his life! When he was 2 he went through at period where almost all he would eat was popsicles. A few months later almost all he would eat would be carrots! I guess they have a way of balancing themselves out lol. <br/>
   <br/>
  Anyway, I offer him food at the times we eat, and sometimes he will eat it and other times he won&#39;t. I have learned that I can&#39;t stress over it because I don&#39;t want to make a huge deal out of food. He is thin too and really eats a lot in the evening. I think a lot of times, he is just so busy playing his games or building legos or whatever, that he doesn&#39;t think of eating. Then evening comes, and he&#39;s watching tv and realizes he is hungry. He usually will eat supper pretty well because he is hungry, but breakfast and lunch are pretty much hit and miss. We tend to sleep late, so breakfast might be partial lunch too. <br/>
   <br/>
  I wouldn&#39;t stress over it. I know the crashing thing is hard. He goes through that too, and I then I just say, &quot;Kyle, I think you are hungry. Maybe you should go in the kitchen and see if there is something you want to eat.&quot; I think he probably DIDN&#39;T realize he was hungry because he was so busy, and then he got irritable. <br/>
   <br/>
  I hope this helps some. I know it isn&#39;t a solution, but sometimes it helps just to know other kids do the same thing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1414263428">~~Every body is different, the key is to learn to listen to your self,<br/>
not go by what others say is &quot;healthier&quot; or &quot;better.&quot;~~<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But my point wasn&#39;t about listening to what others say, my point was<br/>
that it&#39;s healthier to eat smaller amounts more often, rather than a<br/>
large amount. That doesn&#39;t negate the choice to let your system be<br/>
more empty if that feels better to your body. The bottom line is that<br/>
eating big meals isn&#39;t really all that great, but it seems to be what<br/>
we&#39;re trained to do in our society.<br/>
<br/>
And children (as well as adults) can only learn to listen to<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-712132074">Hi Manisha!<br/>
  The only problem I see with a pet, is your long trips away. All of the possiblities that you listed are all very social animals just like dogs and cats. Granted, they are not as large, and can stay in cages, but they love to be held and loved. If they go without that for a while, they can become aggressive, particularly rabbits. Do you have someone, a friend or family member, that would be willing to come make sure that they are fed, watered and have a little play time while you are away? <br/>
  My best suggestion would be the hamster. We have had several and then we moved up to rabbits and a rat. The rat is a wonderful pet, but you do have to interact with it everyday. You also should not feed them through the cage. This will also make them aggressive. <br/>
  I hope this helps. I can understand the anxiety of picking out that first pet for your child. Trust me. It gets easier. We now have 3 dogs, 3 cats, 2 rabbits, 2 cockatiels and a rat. Yes, I am out of my mind. :)<br/>
  Blessings,<br/>
  fae<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-950697982">We have a hamster; he&#39;s almost two.  It&#39;s my first experience with a rodent and I have to say it&#39;s pretty much what I expected it to be -- not very exciting.  (I&#39;ve only had dogs and a cat before.)  But then, my kids don&#39;t take it out and play with it although every other child who comes over is obsessed with it.  The friends from whom we got the hamster (theirs had babies), love them.  They take it in and out of the cage all day, hold them, pet them, etc.  I think if your child really loves animals and wants a pet to play with they&#39;re relatively inexpensive and little work.  The more expensive litter *is* better.  We also got two little rooms that attach to either end of the cage and essentially litter-box trained the hamster (he uses one for a bedroom and one for a bathroom), so we can do a quick clean to cut down odor without having to change the whole cage as frequently.<br/>
<br/>
From what I&#39;ve seen with friends (the ones with a hamster also have a guinea pig and had a rabbit), the bigger the pet the more interesting they tend to be.  On the other hand, the odor is stronger and you need more/bigger of everything.  Their rabbit was a lot of fun, though.<br/>
<br/>
Re vacations, we can leave the hamster with enough food for several days.  If we&#39;re gone longer than that we tend to take him with us.  Definitely think about whether you have someone to pet sit if you&#39;re going to be away longer and can&#39;t take the animal.  While I&#39;m sure plenty of people own both cats and hamsters, I&#39;m hesitant to ask someone else to take on the responsibility of protecting our pet from their cat.  A lot of the friends I would otherwise ask to hamster-sit have cats.  It would be pretty upsetting to all involved if someone else&#39;s cat managed to eat your pet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-270102790">When I was very young we had guinea pigs which did not<br/>
mind being picked up a lot and carried around. They<br/>
are very friendly and soft and fairly easy to take<br/>
care of. So are rabbits. Me and my brother each got<br/>
one when we were around your dd&#39;s age. We had dwarf<br/>
rabbits that could be kept outside (eliminated the<br/>
odor and hair in the house). We acctually had them in<br/>
a cage in a playhouse. Today we have outdoor rabbits<br/>
again and the kids play with them a lot, more when it<br/>
is warm. <br/>
When I was young I acctually took my rabbit for walks<br/>
and it was so tame it would walk behind me like a dog,<br/>
no leash or anything. <br/>
I did get a little lax with cleaning the cage once the<br/>
novelty wore off, but when the kids are this young I<br/>
would help them do this anyways (my parents obviously<br/>
thought otherwise).<br/>
As I understand hamsters and gerbils sleep a lot<br/>
during the day, so they might not be so much fun for<br/>
someone who likes to handle animals a lot. Why don&#39;t<br/>
you take your dd to a pet store and have her observe<br/>
the different options for a while, she might then know<br/>
more of what she would like...<br/>
And make sure you have someone in place who would<br/>
agree to at least feed and take care of the animal<br/>
when you are gone.<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-93109349">Have you researched the degu? They are wonderful rodents that are equally as<br/>
related to the guinea pig as the chinchilla, and full grown are about the<br/>
size of your closed fist. They are smart like a rat without the tail or the<br/>
smell. They are very affectionate if kept alone, but do need a lot of<br/>
attention if they don&#39;t have a buddy to play with. They do very well kept in<br/>
same sex pairs, also. They are very handlable and live about 5 years. When<br/>
Konur is ready for a pet, he will be getting a degu, I cannot say enough<br/>
wonderful things about them.  http://www.degus.org/<br/>

interaction. Or will a move bother a small animal?<br/>
<br/>
Dd has played with a hamster at her friend&#39;s house and<br/>
also with a guinea pig at another friend&#39;s house.<br/>
She&#39;d prefer a guinea pig because hamsters are<br/>
nocturnal. Dh is taking the kids to a pet store today<br/>
to look for cages and such and also see/handle the<br/>
animals.<br/>

<br/>
First I have cats, 3 of them. And yes it would be<br/>

Once while dog sitting one dog died. I was so upset,<br/>
because to some extent I felt responsible. However,<br/>
the dog was old and she just happened to die while I<br/>
was taking care of her. We have to protect our 2<br/>
geckos from my cat. Spike (my cat) is very SMART. So,<br/>
smart he knows where his fake mice are, the geckos,<br/>
and the crickets for the geckos are. And he tries to<br/>
get them. He wants to play with them. But he would<br/>
kill them if he could. But Im smarter than him, and<br/>
Ive put the crickets and his mice in a cupboard that<br/>
is child proof. And the geckos are in a room that his<br/>
is not allowed in. so there is a way to work it out. <br/>
<br/>

Guinea pigs are nocturnal as well. They have vitamin C<br/>
deficiency so they need it added to their water, so<br/>
their water needs to be changed daily. Also if you<br/>
could maybe she should pet sit for a day, to see how<br/>
it would be in her room? Because that is always<br/>
different than just holding a friends or seeing them<br/>
at the pet store. Too many animals wind up in shelters<br/>
or worse because people didnt do their homework<br/>
before hand. I would suggest you read up on what you<br/>
can handle, not just what your daughter would like,<br/>
because when she relaxes on the duties, its your job<br/>
to maintain a healthy environment. I dont say this<br/>
harshly, I say it because I worked for a pet store,<br/>
and too many times, I was asked after a customer<br/>
bought a pet, could they return it or did they know<br/>
anyone who wanted it, because they didnt do their<br/>
research. when you find the right pet, it&#39;s great for<br/>
all. <br/>
<br/>
with our 3 cats, we have a fun time watching them<br/>
chase the laser pointer, spike plays fetch with his<br/>
fake mice, our little dog chases the cats and even<br/>
though our geckos are kinda boring, we like to watch<br/>
them walk up the walls of their cage. and if we had<br/>
more room, and a little bit more money, i&#39;m sure we&#39;d<br/>
have more pets. i know we are crazy. <br/>
<br/>
danie<br/>
it&#39;s just my 2 cents. i can&#39;t stand irresponsible pet<br/>
owners, because they give the responsible pet owners a<br/>
bad name. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-840610408">Yes, I agree, you can protect the hamster from your own cats.  My point was that I wouldn&#39;t want to give that stress and responsibility to a friend.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1518094638">Hi Julie,<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to echo that I have a son(9) in the same boat.  Quite <br/>
thin and with a sporadic appetite as well and he is quite a picky <br/>
eater to boot!!  At least it seems that your guy is open to more <br/>
choices.  I was impressed with the things he will eat!!<br/>
<br/>
The whole food thing is quite an issue for me personally and through <br/>
Unschooling I find we are defooding (like deschooling!).  We have <br/>
pretty much let meal times fall away.  I have noticed that I eat way <br/>
less (a good thing for me I think) when I eat when I am hungry and <br/>
not when it is meal time.  <br/>
<br/>
There are a couple of things my son loves to eat (Apples, carrots and <br/>
Jerkey) So I make sure I toss them around during the day.  This is <br/>
new and has helped quite a bit.  For me the less I say the better.  I <br/>
used to say everytime he got frustrated &quot;do you want something to <br/>
eat?&quot;  How annoying is that??   While probably true...-he is often <br/>
too absorbed in play to break for food, can&#39;t be bothered.   That is <br/>
my cue to just cut up an apple and set it there and for me to walk <br/>
away (important in our dynamic).  I think he knows he is hungry but <br/>
often can&#39;t be bothered.  <br/>
<br/>
Before we found Unschooling we were leaning in the Waldorf <br/>
direction.  I learned some interesting things!  (that&#39;s another <br/>
story!)  Not sure how to describe without rambling too much...but <br/>
anyway a tidbit of information that helped me relax a bit about DS <br/>
being thin and really not interested in food (there is so much <br/>
cultural hype about a healthy appetite, what is &quot;normal&quot; etc etc) was <br/>
the concept of what is refered to in Waldorf circles as the four <br/>
temperaments(like personality types).  You could look for more info <br/>
online but suffice to say that the temperament that matched him the <br/>
most mentioned the food thing and being generally lean.  (I just <br/>
googled the four temperaments and there is way more info than what I <br/>
remember!!....anyway just passing on the tidbit I took away that <br/>
helped me relax a bit).  <br/>
<br/>
It seems your major concern is the crash thing and that he might <br/>
carry it into adulthood... I think the less of a deal you can make of <br/>
it, the extremes will probably balance out.  <br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1142274653">Amongst other very good and helpful suggestions, some societal<br/>
generalities, and fabulous unschooly sentiments there is an opinion<br/>
stated as fact.  &quot;It&#39;s a healthier way to eat&quot; is not an absolute<br/>
here.  I just can&#39;t see how declaring one way of eating as healthier<br/>
helps the situation, when it is not what the child&#39;s body feels like<br/>
doing at the moment.  Am I missing something?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if you are equating what you feel to be a &quot;big&quot; meal with<br/>
over-eating where you eat more than what your body is comfortable<br/>
with. That would be different. <br/>

<br/>
Yes, you&#39;re missing the point that the child wasn&#39;t hungry at &quot;meal<br/>
times&quot; and I was suggesting NOT focusing on a mealtime but on making<br/>
food available at all times!<br/>
<br/>
The point wasn&#39;t to debate whether eating large amounts three times a<br/>
day is healthier than eating small amounts more frequently, it was<br/>
about letting go of the idea of a specific meal time! I still believe<br/>
that people tend to overeat by sticking to the three meals a day<br/>
thing....and that eating smaller amounts when you&#39;re hungry is MUCH<br/>
better.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>From the original post:<br/>
&lt;&lt; I am all for letting him choose for himself what and when to eat.<br/>
We have always given free-reign of the kitchen and everything in it.<br/>
If the kids are hungry all they have to do is go get it or ask for it<br/>
to be made or if they can cook it now that they are old enough. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I guess we were hearing different things from the same post.  That<br/>
happens! I wasn&#39;t trying to &quot;debate&quot; anything, and I didn&#39;t want to<br/>
make anyone feel defensive when I gave a personal example.  Ren, I see<br/>
where you did respond to another poster who may have been having<br/>
trouble with mealtimes; I understand where ideas could overlap.  :) <br/>
<br/>
The thread jumped out at me because of my daughter&#39;s eating habits,<br/>
which include going very long stretches without eating when she does<br/>
not feel hungry.  We have worked with her to prevent the crashes that<br/>
inevitably occur, and it is usually with some sort of smoothie, drink<br/>
or the whole food chewable vitamin she likes.  The remark that another<br/>
way of eating was healthier took me by surprise, because I was reading<br/>
that they boy was following his body&#39;s cues not to eat when he wasn&#39;t<br/>
feeling hungry.  I see too much diversity in the eating habits of<br/>
people who aren&#39;t tied to mealtime ideology to agree with it in the<br/>
original context, without the clarification that it was in reference<br/>
to overeaters and mealtimes.  <br/>
<br/>
Everything else I had read regarding suggestions to support the boy<br/>
seemed right on, and things I myself had tried - which includes<br/>
setting out trays of pre-prepped and fun food. Perhaps the only thing<br/>
I could add would be that cups with lids and/or straws seem to help<br/>
because she just grabs it and keeps playing.  Makes consumption easier<br/>
&quot;on the go!&quot; And as temperature was noted as a factor, it&#39;s true for<br/>
us and we do use insulated cups all the time.<br/>
<br/>
What we&#39;ve found with Fin is that these things cycle, depending on<br/>
growth spurts and such and what she&#39;s currently interesting in doing.<br/>
I used to worry, I don&#39;t anymore. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck, Mama!<br/>

What you&#39;re missing is that I was responding to another poster, NOT<br/>
the original poster. I even clipped what she said about her child not<br/>
wanting to eat at mealtimes. THAT&#39;S what I was responding to! <br/>
<br/>
The person I was responding to wasn&#39;t having the same issues and<br/>
therefore got a different response. Please read the entire post,<br/>
rather than hyperfocusing on one comment meant for a specific  idea<br/>
(about having food available at mealtimes when a child may not be<br/>
hungry!).<br/>

I can&#39;t stand hamsters personally...I think they&#39;re tiny devils in<br/>
furry bodies.:) BUT, my dd wants another one (rats are SO much better<br/>
imo) so we looked at some tonight and found out that the Chinese<br/>
dwarves are much more social, don&#39;t bite and can live with another<br/>
hamster (most hamsters will kill each other once they hit puberty).<br/>
<br/>
So if we get another hamster, it will be a chinese dwarf. Thought that<br/>
might be useful for you in your research.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Frogs are more like decoration than pets ;-) If they&#39;re the kind we  <br/>
have they wait around in the muck on the bottom until food arrives.  <br/>
We&#39;ve had ours for a *long* time (8 years at least). That&#39;s about the  <br/>
most interesting thing about them ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Ferrets are fun :-) They sleep for 20 some hours a day so they stay  <br/>
in their cage most of the time. We let ours run around the house and  <br/>
they&#39;re just little bundles of energy. Then after an hour and a half  <br/>
they&#39;ve burned themselves out and they go back in the cage and fall  <br/>
asleep. (The odor is what most people object to but there&#39;s a product  <br/>
called Bi-Odor that you squirt in their food and takes care of that.)<br/>
<br/>
Our cats are a bit smaller than average and the ferrets can nip feet  <br/>
pretty good (wearing shoes solves that problem) so the cats have  <br/>
never seen them as prey. (Though we did adopt them as 2 and 3 yos.)  <br/>
One cat enjoys watching them but the other actually enjoys playing  <br/>
with them and rubs up against them.<br/>
