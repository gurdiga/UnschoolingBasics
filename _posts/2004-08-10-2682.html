My husband used to have such severe sinus infections when he was a<br/>
smoker. Also when he held our babies they used to reach up and grab his<br/>
lit cigerette. When our eldest went to school and heard how awful<br/>
smoking is for the body she went on a continued rampage at home about<br/>
it. She would even steal her father&#39;s cigerettes and throw them out. He<br/>
would get so mad. She would still take them. She would write him letters<br/>
begging him to stop smoking because she loved him. He quit. Cold turkey<br/>
and has never smoked again. Can&#39;t say the same for me. I quit and every<br/>
now and then when I am so very overwhelmed I will grab a cigerette. Most<br/>
of the time I don&#39;t feel the urge for one. My 16 year old son is very<br/>
nervous, too and seems the most dependent on smoking. He quit smoking<br/>
pot, though. I felt really afraid that he and my two daughters, aged 23<br/>
and 19 were smoking pot. They knew I didn&#39;t feel comfortable with it<br/>
yet, I want a clear communication network between us, so we discussed it<br/>
a few times. They don&#39;t like alcohol. They have known people who have<br/>
died regarding drinking and driving. They were over to a friends house<br/>
and a boy slit his wrist while there. He was drunk and the police were<br/>
called, etc. These are the things that scare me. It isn&#39;t them just<br/>
sitting having a smoke, etc. There are others who gather to &quot;like<br/>
energy&quot; who have more going on who don&#39;t have anyone they can discuss<br/>
their emotional concerns with. My kids end up ministering to others,<br/>
which isn&#39;t a bad thing. It has taken a toll on them, at times, though.<br/>
Then we talk about it and come to some kind of conclusion. It has made<br/>
them closer to one another and us as a family. The best conversations<br/>
seem to be at 11pm for some reason:) Still I keep an &quot;extra eye&quot; on my<br/>
16 year old son. He seems so fragile in some ways from his years at<br/>
public school. He is healing. He said something quite telling last<br/>
night. That he wants a &quot;skanky&quot; girlfriend because he is &quot;skanky&quot; and<br/>
they are the only ones who would like him. Oui vey... So we talked about<br/>
that. He is in love with a young girl who is emotionally &quot;lost.&quot; Her<br/>
mother uses cocaine and her father was in jail. I think the mom just let<br/>
the father move back in after he got out. On one hand he feels drawn to<br/>
this girl of &quot;like energy&quot; and on the other hand he &quot;knows.&quot; If I slam<br/>
the door shut on him I fear I will lose him. My kids pain is my pain. I<br/>
have told them all I will be with them with a whole heart and open mind.<br/>
That has been tested over and over again. Michele<br/>
