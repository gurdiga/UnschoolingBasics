<div id="ygrps-yiv-427552178">I lurk here very frequently and only post occasionally, because most <br/>
of my questions get answered through other people&#39;s posts. However, I <br/>
wanted to share my fantastic news with everyone, b/c everyone here is <br/>
so great. After 5 years of trying, I found out I&#39;m pregnant (6 <br/>
weeks)!!! One of the things I&#39;m most excited about is the opportunity <br/>
to unschool from the very beginning! I have a 12 yo dd (will be 13 in <br/>
January) and we just started unschooling with her a few months ago and <br/>
it has been great, now my baby will get to live in freedom from day 1, <br/>
woo-hoo! Just had to share... thanks again to everyone here who keeps <br/>
this group going and gives fab answers!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1822232677">Congratulations Leslie!  It&#39;s interesting to see the differences in<br/>
children that are unschooled from the beginning. My oldest child has<br/>
learned a lot through the journey of seeing his younger sibs<br/>
unschooled too.:)<br/>
