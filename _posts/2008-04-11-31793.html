Interestingly in Morocco, even most of the little children spoke<br/>
English really well.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
those THREE YEAR OLD German kids<br/>
spoke better German than *we* did. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
We are living in Barcelona Spain at present, and so are having to learn <br/>
2 languages, &#39;Spainish&#39; - or as they call it here &#39;Castillan&#39; and the <br/>
local regional language &#39;Catalan&#39;. When we arrived in Spain we didnt <br/>
know a word of each langauge, but I have picked up quite a lot in the <br/>
past few month. The one problem is I seem to be learning what I refer to <br/>
as &#39;Spatalan&#39; - so strange hibrid mix of the 2 languages as I am picking <br/>
it up form the people round me - shop keepers etc. I supose I am <br/>
learning they way small children do - hearing a sound and associating it <br/>
with an object or action - give me a whole new persepctive of what an <br/>
amazing job little ones do just learning to speak.<br/>
<br/>
I find reading the langauge much easier -whichever one it is- and I <br/>
think that is because firtsly I am not rushed, with speach you hear it <br/>
once and have to try work it out - with something written you can keep <br/>
looking at it till you work it out, and secondly both Castillian and <br/>
Catalan must havbe a similar &#39;root&#39; to at least some of English as if <br/>
you think about it you can sort of work it out - for example cuina is <br/>
cooking - kind of like culinary, and a lot of words just look the same, <br/>
television and foto are quite easy to work out.<br/>
<br/>
Once I have got half a dozen words in a sentance it becomes more of a <br/>
&#39;code breaking&#39; exercise, trying to work out the missing bits by <br/>
thinking of what would make a logical sentance - things like if it has a <br/>
question mark or exclamation mark help too.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I have been doing which is helping loads is reading Harry <br/>
Potter. I am a great fan of the boy wizard and have read all the book so <br/>
many times that I know them quite well. So I have borrowed the books in <br/>
Catalan from the local library and am &#39;reading&#39; them again. It really <br/>
helps that I know what it should be saying - I can always refer to the <br/>
English copy if I get stuck, and it a good way to pick up those everyday <br/>
words we use so much - and, but, also, perhaps, etc. and it shows the <br/>
differences in verb structure too.<br/>
<br/>
I got the idea from  Swedish Home Ed family we met last year whose <br/>
children had learnt English because they couldn&#39;t wait for the then next <br/>
harry potter book to be published in Swedish!<br/>

There is a common root sort of - Catalan, Spanish, French, Italian (and<br/>

<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And having learned both (German and Latin), I see EXTREME similarities <br/>
between the two. I cannot understand how they are considered <br/>
&quot;opposites.&quot; (Not really &quot;opposites,&quot;, but I can&#39;t come up with another <br/>
way to describe them. It&#39;s as if a language must be EITHER Romance OR <br/>
Germanic.)<br/>
<br/>
I learned Latin first (well, after six years of French), and English <br/>
seemed very much like a Romance language at that time---such common <br/>
words and all. Then I learned Spanish, then German. German seemed to me <br/>
like English with a heavy accent---and the Latin syntax.<br/>
<br/>
To *me*, German is a combination of English and Latin. Like---someone <br/>
took English words and gave them declensions and gender, placed all the <br/>
words in a sentence in twisted Latin order, make VERY strict phonics <br/>
rules, and then added a strong accent. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll have to look into Basque---it might look a lot like English to me! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1972695430">I took two and a half years of classical Greek when I was working on <br/>
my MFA and loved it.  We were learning Attic Greek, translating <br/>
Euripides and Plato and throwing in a little New Testament Greek for <br/>
the students who were planning on going to Seminary.  Greek was such <br/>
a logical, precise, yet poetic language - the most amazing <br/>
combination of reason and poetry that I&#39;ve ever seen.<br/>
<br/>
One of my pet theories of why English is such a complicated language <br/>
is that there&#39;s a tremendous gap between our concrete, everyday <br/>
language (Anglo-Saxon) and our abstract, technical languages <br/>
(stemming mostly from Greek and Latin).  What was wonderful about <br/>
Greek was that the most abstract language of Plato grew directly out <br/>
of the most concrete everyday language.  Even the most complex ideas <br/>
have a physical, experiential grounding in Greek that is sadly <br/>
lacking in English.  Psyche means &quot;breath&quot;, and if you pronounce it <br/>
in the Greek way it actually sounds like breathing in and breathing <br/>
out - psoo kay.  The breath is the spirit of a person, the soul, the <br/>
center.  Makes perfect sense when you think of it that way!<br/>

   <br/>
  My mother tongue ( language I grew up with:) ) is Portuguese. I also speak Spanish pretty well and basic French.<br/>
  English  for me is extremely easy.<br/>
  I learned so fast. I had studied as a child and always loved it . At 16 I came to the US and in 6 months I spoke perfect English, better than I do now.<br/>
  I spent about a year at 16-17 years old in the US and then went back to Brazil to go finish high school and go to Law School.<br/>
  I moved back to the US at 28 and a that time I still spoke great English but now had an accent that I still have today at 42.<br/>
  But you see how people are different. You may find English complicated , I find it really easy.<br/>
  I speak Portuguese to my kids at home. Dad speaks English.<br/>
  They understand everything in Portuguese but speak mostly English.<br/>
   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1604239026">My 17yo picked up some German by listening to Ramstein (sp?), a German <br/>
music group. I don&#39;t speak or read German but I did study it for 3 <br/>
semesters in college (can hardly remember any of it now even though my <br/>
professor said I should switch my major to German). My ds would listen <br/>
to the tapes with me so that probably made it a little easier for him <br/>
to recognize. He never asked me for any help with translation, though. <br/>
He figured it out on his own.<br/>

and once a friend of mine, who knows I speak some<br/>
German asked me to translate. :) www.dictionary.com<br/>
has a translater if you ever want to find out the<br/>
translation of a word.<br/>
<br/>
I like to speak some German while I am out with my son<br/>
(he&#39;s 9). Like at the grocery store, I tell him what<br/>
different things are in German... Kartofflen for<br/>
potatoes, Milch for milk, etc. If he ever becomes<br/>
curious to know more, I&#39;ll teach him, but for now I&#39;m<br/>
just having fun labeling at the store.<br/>

I lived in Germany when I was a toddler. The only words I remembered <br/>
were Kartofflen, kaput, and verboten.&lt;g&gt; Verboten may be from Hogan&#39;s <br/>
Heroes though! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do you speak in short sentences ever? Cameron knows a few short phrases <br/>
because I would say them a lot. &quot;Tur zu&quot; (shut the door) is a common <br/>
one. And things I didn&#39;t mean for others/strangers to <br/>
understand/overhear I would say in German---like &quot;Keine Fingern in der <br/>
Nase.&quot; (does that need translation? &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Just like learning the first language, nursery rhymes and songs are a <br/>
GREAT way to introduce lots of words and phrases. There&#39;s a very sweet <br/>
lullaby I learned that I&#39;ll still sing to them when they&#39;re sick or <br/>
really sleepy, but struggling. And a &quot;hopping&quot; rhyme for bouncing on <br/>
your knee. They&#39;re easier to remember too---with the rhymes and <br/>
patterns and rhythms. I wish I knew more! But a children&#39;s book with <br/>
lots of short rhymes would be a good investment---you know---like the <br/>
German version of The Itsy Bitsy Spider? That kind of thing, with hand <br/>
motions too!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about the acquisition of the language---verb placement and...the <br/>
...*rhythm* of the language is the best &quot;description&quot; I can come up <br/>
with---it&#39;s the *rhythm* that&#39;s important. And children&#39;s rhymes and <br/>
games and songs are so good for that!<br/>
