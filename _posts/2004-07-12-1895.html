<div id="ygrps-yiv-934237892">&quot;i have noticed a negative and judging feeling thing<br/>
out there on this list and wonder if i am the only one<br/>
feeling this&quot;<br/>

Dina,<br/>
Our guidelines very clearly state that discussing the posts is off <br/>
limits. If you have a problem with something, either ignore the <br/>
advice, or give advice YOU feel is most helpful please.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re here to say negative things about the list, or about how <br/>
people are posting, that is going against the lists guidelines.<br/>
<br/>
For the record, I have recieved some very positive emails from folks <br/>
thanking Kelly and I for starting the list, so apparently it&#39;s <br/>
working for most of the people here. We aren&#39;t going to please <br/>
everyone, but please refrain from talking about other posts.<br/>
Just post what you think is helpful, it will keep the list flowing <br/>
much smoother. Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Ren</div>
