&gt;   Dear All,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been reading this list for some time and this is my first time<br/>
&gt; posting. I admit. I&#39;m scared! I&#39;m very new to the idea of mindful<br/>
&gt; parenting and unschooling, but &#39;thanks&#39; to you guys, I had to leave the<br/>
&gt; Love and Logic seminar my husband and I went to this last weekend within<br/>
&gt; the first hour. We had signed up for it in January, and then I joined<br/>
&gt; this group and now I can&#39;t stand the most mainstream style of parenting<br/>
&gt; out there. Thanks a LOT. ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have a five year old daughter and a two and a half year old son. My<br/>
&gt; question is, how does mindful parenting deal with sibling fights at this<br/>
&gt; age. Like, when my daughter takes a toy my son is playing with and<br/>
&gt; when he obviously wants it back, she ignores his requests, whether he<br/>
&gt; asks for it verbally or via screaming. Among the many responses I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; had, many of them not ones I&#39;m proud of...the one that has worked most<br/>
&gt; often is asking her if he sounds like he&#39;s happy or unhappy. And then<br/>
&gt; seeing if she can think of anything that may make him happy. But I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t see her wanting to stop making him upset in the first place. Can<br/>
&gt; someone assure me that this will change at some point in her growing up<br/>
&gt; life? They get along well a lot of the time...it&#39;s that 10% that&#39;s got<br/>
&gt; me stumped.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I wonder if others can share their experience with their kids...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks a lot,<br/>

I did some love and logic before unschooling and love and logic is <br/>
very hard to do with unschooling- here is why- they say to give the <br/>
child choices BUT only choices that you as the parent are <br/>
comfortable with- so not real choice but parent comfortable choice- <br/>
also they are big about NOT saving the child from hurt or pain- so <br/>
if they leave something out in the rain you leave it there as a <br/>
consequence<br/>
<br/>
it is not really about unschooling at all<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-68072117">Julie,<br/>
Thanks for the reply. I can totally see how the second part doesn&#39;t mesh<br/>
with unschooling. I wouldn&#39;t intentionally let something valuable to my<br/>
child get damaged as a &quot;consequence&quot; for them to learn not to leave it out<br/>
in the rain - clearly it&#39;s not a &quot;natural&quot; consequence if I actually saw it<br/>
and could have prevented it!<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I think the part about &quot;only choices we&#39;re comfortable<br/>
with&quot; would make a good topic for discussion here. Maybe it&#39;s all in<br/>
defining &quot;parent comfort&quot; as opposed to strong disagreement or going against<br/>
our values. I think as usual, talking about specific examples here vs. these<br/>
abstract ideas, will help, but right now I don&#39;t have the time to think of<br/>
one, so I&#39;m hoping someone else will get the conversation going.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Barbara<br/>

   <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I completely agree.  Seems to me like a huge side-effect/benefit of unschooling is for the parents to grow!  It reminds me of a conversation I had with my mom awhile ago when we were struggling to get the girls to go to bed when we wanted them to go to bed.  She said, &quot;you just have to give them a choice - as in &#39;would you like to sleep in our bed or in your own bed?&#39;, and then be firm after they choose&quot;.  So the kid picks one thing the parent has already decided is within their comfort zone and doesn&#39;t disrupt things at all in the parents&#39; tightly controlled world.  At least that&#39;s the plan.  Seems to me this is just a form of coercion.  So I replied to my mom, &#39;okay, but what if they don&#39;t want either option or they change their minds, do I really want to &#39;be firm&#39; when it causes so much unhapiness, when it means a tantrum (like duh, I wouldn&#39;t have known that would happen when I set up the whole false &#39;choice&#39; scenario).  If I just mindlessly give them regurgitated<br/>
 choices, 2 things I&#39;ve already decided wouldn&#39;t disrupt my perfect control, in my opinion that is treating them like they are brain dead, like they couldn&#39;t possibly know what they need/want, which I don&#39;t for a second believe.  So I&#39;m choosing the unschooling option, which means I have to change and grow right along with them.  I see this as not only honouring our children as being immensely capable and knowing, it also honours us parents as being capable of s-t-r-e-t-c-h-i-n-g far more than we ever thought we were capable of!  Uncomfortable here I come :).  <br/>

<br/>
On the other hand, I think the part about &quot;only choices we&#39;re <br/>
comfortable<br/>
with&quot; would make a good topic for discussion here. Maybe it&#39;s all in<br/>
defining &quot;parent comfort&quot; as opposed to strong disagreement or going <br/>
against<br/>
our values. I think as usual, talking about specific examples here vs. <br/>
these<br/>
abstract ideas, will help, but right now I don&#39;t have the time to think <br/>
of<br/>
one, so I&#39;m hoping someone else will get the conversation going.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
As the mom of a 20 year old, I can assure you that we have had our <br/>
share of parental discomfort---from drinking and drugs to sex and <br/>
hitchhiking.<br/>
<br/>
The deal is: *his* is NOT *my* life.<br/>
<br/>
I canNOT decide what he chooses and what he does.<br/>
<br/>
I can potentially influence him---*especially* if I have his trust <br/>
because I haven&#39;t run roughshod over him for years and years.<br/>
<br/>
He truly does take my advice, and he considers many angles *because* we <br/>
have not restricted him---*because* we have let him make REAL choices <br/>
and not pretend ones (like in Love and Logic).<br/>
<br/>
A lot of what he&#39;s done/wants to do has gone/goes against my personal <br/>
values and/or I strongly disagree with. It really doesn&#39;t matter. I <br/>
trust him to make the best choice for him at this minute. He doesn&#39;t <br/>
usually do things impulsively. (He has, in the past. But he&#39;s learned a <br/>
LOT from those choices and seems to make better ones all the time.)<br/>
<br/>
Some of his choices, I feel sure, he feels...not necessarily <br/>
*regret*...but that he could have made better choices. That&#39;s a GOOD <br/>
thing to know---that you can CHOOSE to make better choices in the <br/>
future. That those early, maybe rash, decisions weren&#39;t failures or <br/>
mistakes---just learning-takes.<br/>
<br/>
He knows that we&#39;re available at all times to bounce ideas off of, and <br/>
he seems to be struggling less with tougher decisions/choices.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really hard as parents NOT to want to protect our children from <br/>
every single potentially harmful thing out there. But I try not to see <br/>
that as my job. I see my role as a facilitator---someone who will help <br/>
make things happen---even things I don&#39;t agree with---IF that&#39;s what he <br/>
wants. I will try really hard to give him as many options and help him <br/>
see as many angles, but I have to be willing to let him make those <br/>
choices---and learn from them.<br/>
<br/>
We really *can&#39;t* make all the decisions for kids and expect them to <br/>
get out on their own and make wise choices. It&#39;s like that frog-kissing <br/>
saying: you gotta kiss a lot of frogs before you find your prince? <br/>
You&#39;ve got to make a lot of (often lousy) choices before you have the <br/>
confidence to make big, serious GOOD ones.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my goal: to let him, through trial and error, learn how to think <br/>
through the tough ones.<br/>
<br/>
And if I choose to do all (or even a little!) of his thinking *for* <br/>
him, how will he learn? We all really do learn by DOING, not by being <br/>
told what to do!<br/>
<br/>
My comfort zone is all s-t-r-e-t-c-h-e-d out. I&#39;ve become a VERY soft <br/>
place to land. My in-laws, for example, are still &quot;rigid rubber;&quot; and <br/>
when their kids make &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; decisions, there&#39;s no comfortable <br/>
place to land. They just get smacked around a SECOND time when the <br/>
parents find out how stupid they&#39;ve been. Insult to injury---and <br/>
probably a punishment of some kind too.<br/>
<br/>
That *can* make some folks try harder to make the &quot;right&quot; decisions <br/>
next time---to avoid punishment or to avoid disappointing their <br/>
parents. But that&#39;s not what I want my boys to do: I want them to make <br/>
better decisions next time because they learned a better way, because <br/>
they thought this one out a little more, because they don&#39;t want to <br/>
disappoint *themselves*.<br/>
<br/>
*I* really shouldn&#39;t enter the equation.<br/>
<br/>
But they will get my input. Because I want what&#39;s best for them. They <br/>
know that, because I&#39;ve demonstrated that over and over---NOT by <br/>
protecting them from themselves, but by helping them make choices and <br/>
respecting their choices, even when I didn&#39;t agree with them. (That&#39;s <br/>
part of why they often *do* take my advice &#39;cause they know I won&#39;t <br/>
&quot;pull rank&quot; on them---that I will support them 100%, because I *have*, <br/>
in the past. It makes for a very, very trusting relationship.)<br/>
<br/>
They know when I&#39;m uncomfortable. I&#39;m not shy expressing myself. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
But they also know I will do my best to help them achieve that goal no <br/>
matter what my feelings. &#39;Cause it&#39;s not my life.<br/>
<br/>
I get to make ALL the decisions I can possibly make in my own life. I <br/>
don&#39;t get to make theirs too.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a good point - and a good reason for digging down into our <br/>
principles and thinking hard about how we want to live by them. <br/>
<br/>
I was really really comfortable as a &quot;tough love&quot; authoritarian <br/>
parent. I was good at it. I could justify the heck out of rules and <br/>
as for consistency - wow, you have never met anyone as able to <br/>
consistently apply a rule as I was. And it Worked! My stepson went <br/>
from leaving adults black and blue and destroying property to <br/>
sitting quietly in time out when told to do so. And that&#39;s where my <br/>
principles kicked in and went &quot;Wooooooaaaahhhhh! Is This what peace <br/>
and freedom looks like?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Oops.<br/>
<br/>
So I started to s-t-r-e-t-c-h, as Kelly so nicely put it ;) I had to <br/>
stretch my level of comfort a whole heck of a lot in some respects, <br/>
but mostly I had to stretch my ability to live by my principles. To <br/>
do that, I had to get really clear about what my principles were and <br/>
start thinking about how I was going to Live them, rather than Apply <br/>
them. That took a good bit of stretching, right there, and at times <br/>
I Still have to stretch to do that. Its so much easier to snap &quot;why <br/>
can&#39;t you two get along?&quot; than figure out how to apply a principle <br/>
of Respectfulness, myself.<br/>

I just finished a chat with my daughter who lives in Vienna/Austria. Her Daniel is nearly four. She was &#39;complaining&#39; about his sometimes being difficult to live with and making so much messes - unecessary.<br/>
She is open to a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to my being a member of unschooling groups for many years I was able to very gently lead her from seing this issue as a &#39;Daniel has to change to fit into the adult views&#39; problem to a &#39;how can I change the environment to allow Daniel to be who he is&#39; view.<br/>
<br/>
For me unschooling means respectful relating. Principles and values fit the bill of respect. Rules on the other hand are like laws, designed to make people behave in certain ways to make others/the lawmakers feel good.<br/>
