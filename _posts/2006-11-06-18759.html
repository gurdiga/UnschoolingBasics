<div id="ygrps-yiv-521803040">Erica,<br/>
I also have a daughter at the ninth grade level per public education. To make a long story short, she decided on her own not to attend High School, and is now unschooling, so she has been out now since school let out last June. For the naysayers, give them a copy of &quot;The Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot; if they are people who matter (like your ex and his partner) and ignore the rest. I took a highlighter and highlighted the parts in that book that stood out for me/us to make it easier for the naysayers who did not want to go through the whole book to &quot;get it.&quot;<br/>
As far as schooling, my daughter made up a list of what she wanted to accomplish while out of school. It turned out to be pretty extensive: SCUBA diving, gymnastics, belly dancing, travel. I have yet to faclitate some of that stuff due to the fact that I work full time (hope to quit by the end of the year or get reduced work hours) but so far she is more relaxed, less grumpy and surly, and communicates more. I try and point those things out to the people who say she isnt doing anything. Isnt our relationship and her mental health worth more than schoolwork? I am noticing that gradually she is getting more interested in the world again, and learning naturally, not artificially just by paying attention to life. For example, I was making a dish called Mjeddrah the other night and she asked what it was so I read the description in the cookbook. &quot;Mjeddrah is a very old dish from the Middle East. According to biblical schlars, mjeddrah is the &quot;mess of pottage for which Esau sold his birt<br/>
hright to Jacob.&quot;  I am no Biblical scholar but she spent two years in Christian School so she said. &quot;Oh yeah, i remember that.&quot; and went off to pull out her childrens bible and review the story. (we dont id as Christians but I sent her thier because we could afford it and there are no drugs there.) After that it branched off into a discussion about the merits of combining lentils and rice and the protein content of various foods, then on to the merits of vegetarianism for the health of the planet, animal rights, and  personal choices as political action. All this came from a simple question &quot;what is mjeddrah?&quot; This kind of discussion would never have happened while she was still in school. While she was in school I would pick her up and she would be depressed and surly, complain about homework, not do it, get stressed out over it, hole up in her room and stay on the computer, or get in arguments that went around and around in circles. <br/>
This is getting long and rambling, but now she reads alot of books and has a guitar teacher come in once a week. From the outside looking in she is not doing much, sleeping past noon and staying up way too late watching TV. But even TV is sparking interests and debate. Email offlist if you want.<br/>

We pulled Cameron out at the end of sixth grade. He was 13.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never heard anyone say they wished they&#39;d started unschooling <br/>
*later*---only that they wished they&#39;d started earlier.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s never too late! Well, until she&#39;s GONE!<br/>
<br/>
If your child were required to swim in quick-sandy-muck until noon, but <br/>
you saw her struggling and swallowing muck and breathing muck and about <br/>
to  sink or suffocate, would you wait until noon to pull her out? <br/>
Wouldn&#39;t you grab a stick and pull her out---even if it were only 9:30? <br/>
Given the choice, you would probably NOT have sent her into the muck at <br/>
all, but she&#39;s there now. Do you help her out at 11:30? Or just let her <br/>
struggle and sink and suffocate?<br/>
<br/>
Mine wouldn&#39;t stay in a MINUTE longer than it would take me to find a <br/>
stick.<br/>
<br/>
Damage is done, but with a warm bubble bath and some chocolate, she can <br/>
start healing.<br/>
<br/>
Would it have been better to treat her that way from the beginning? <br/>
Sure, but do you want her to suffer *longer* just because *you* didn&#39;t <br/>
rescue her soon enough? Wouldn&#39;t *ANY* time out of the muck be better <br/>
than none?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Who has custody? Clear that up first.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no &quot;work&quot; to be done. She needs to *heal* first. She needs to <br/>
learn to trust you. She needs respect and patience.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it&#39;ll *look* as if she&#39;s procrastinating---but she&#39;ll be healing.<br/>
<br/>
WHY would she need to go back to school at some time? Is that the goal?<br/>
<br/>
How do you flunk out of life?<br/>
<br/>
How do you never amount to anything?<br/>
<br/>
If these are the messages she&#39;s getting, she needs to get far, far away.<br/>
<br/>
How long will *you* procrastinate before you pull her out of a the <br/>
muck? The end of the school year? Christmas break? Thanksgiving break? <br/>
TOMORROW???<br/>
<br/>
Drive down toDAY and pull her out of the muck! Go out to lunch to <br/>
celebrate your new life, free of muck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1945385201">I too have a resistant ex.  It&#39;s amazing how similar this is; he said the exact same thing--that my son would not do the work, that he is not self motivated ( he was not).<br/>
I do not want fight him over this issue; this would do more damage to my almost 14 year old.  I decided to homeschool him at the beginning of 7th grade, as he was drowning in the muck.  I have physical custody and we have joint custody.<br/>
<br/>
I can say that, though I was trained as a teacher and worked with at-risk kids, unmotivated kids, damaged by the system kids, this is by far the most difficult thing I have ever done.  <br/>
<br/>
The end result though was that my son became HAPPY.  So much so that his dad noticed.  This has made a difference.  The other thing I did was to document what we accomplished and provide dad with a scrap book full of pictures from the field trips we took ( we do many cool things )- with my son&#39;s happy face prominent - and the many activities and academic work he accomplished , which, despite the struggles, he was proud of.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not too late to start; it just may be hard for a while, so it requires more patience.  My son asks me why we did not start earlier ( my husband ), but he sure is glad we are doing it now.  He had thought himself a dismal failure because of his schooling experience.  The good news is he not only does not feel a failure, he feels there is nothing he can&#39;t accomplish... It&#39;s really great.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1834169121">I&#39;m a little behind in answering posts, but I did read them all, and <br/>
I just wanted to say thank you all for responding. I&#39;ve been reading <br/>
and pondering. <br/>
<br/>
My dd was ill this past week (a viral cold, but she milked it for all <br/>
it was worth, to keep from having to go back to school), and we spent <br/>
a lot of time together. It was great. And as for co-sleeping, she <br/>
sleeps with me now when she comes to my house. I&#39;m enjoying it, <br/>
except when she crowds me out of the bed!<br/>
<br/>
To answer some questions: we have joint custody, but the kids live <br/>
officially with him. I really don&#39;t want to ruin the good <br/>
relationship we have maintained since the divorce, so I am holding <br/>
out for his coming around. DD and I each wrote letters to him, from <br/>
the heart, and yesterday dd and I compiled a &#39;curriculum&#39; of sorts, <br/>
of all the subjects she wants to learn about. We listed all the <br/>
core/school subjects she&#39;d be learning about under each topic. <br/>
Hopefully, my ex (deh? dex? lol) will relax and let us do a trial <br/>
run. If he digs in his heels, I&#39;m not certain what I&#39;m going to do. <br/>
DD is determined to leave ps by the Thanksgiving break. If he forces <br/>
her to go back, I do think it will break her spirit. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, for the responses, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1528668171">Hi everyone. This is an update on my dd and unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
I pulled her out of ps officially, I thought, last week. I was <br/>
informed by the asst principal that I did not have the right to do <br/>
so, because my ex has the right to determine where she lives, and he <br/>
did not agree. I allowed her to stay out of school, anyway. <br/>
<br/>
Today my ex went to court and got an order that says, in effect, that <br/>
he has the right to her, and I may only see her with his written <br/>
permission, and that she must go back to public school. He refuses to <br/>
withdraw her legally, because she has to face the consequences of her <br/>
actions. And those are that she has to go to school, because he <br/>
totally disagrees with her (and my) choice of education. We didn&#39;t <br/>
follow the rules and get his agreement, so he went over my head, &#39;to <br/>
stop something really bad&#39; from happening. My ex says Claire is <br/>
truant. <br/>
<br/>
Of course, our dd informed him she hated him and would not <br/>
participate in school, even if she had to just go and sit in the <br/>
chair. She would not cooperate. Period. He was about to let her stay <br/>
with me, if I promised she&#39;d go to school tomorrow, and then abruptly <br/>
decided she had to come home with him after she told him she would <br/>
go, but would not work at her grades. She left, but was furious. <br/>
<br/>
I cautioned her to play his game, and keep her mouth shut. He wasn&#39;t <br/>
going to agree with her. I doubt she will, tho. She even talked to <br/>
him about Dead Poet&#39;s Society, wherein the boy kills himself because <br/>
his father won&#39;t listen to him about his future. Now I&#39;m worried that <br/>
my ex will put her in the psych hospital. I don&#39;t think she really <br/>
would commit suicide, because she knows I&#39;m on her side here. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m on a very limited income as a full time student (having trouble <br/>
paying bills, and no extra money), and can&#39;t afford an atty. I called <br/>
legal aid, but they fill up their appts early in the morning for the <br/>
next day&#39;s appts. I won&#39;t get an appt until Thursday at the earliest, <br/>
and I want to contest this NOW. <br/>
<br/>
This is a rant, and a plea for any suggestions. I think I was legally <br/>
wrong to take her out of school without my ex&#39;s agreement: an atty at <br/>
my university told me this, and told me to get into mediation <br/>
immediately to get custody of dd, so I could make the decision. I was <br/>
trying to get with legal aid. I can attend a free clinic, but it&#39;ll <br/>
be tomorrow night. BTW, I&#39;m in Texas, and we have a joint managing <br/>
conservatorship, with my ex having the right to determine her <br/>
residence. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening, <br/>
<br/>
Erica<br/>

I hate to be a downer, but unless the ex agrees, you probably don&#39;t<br/>
have a leg to stand on.  And putting all of you into the court system<br/>
means that the court has more power to make decisions than either<br/>
parent individually.<br/>
<br/>
My advice is to work WITH him as much as possible and foster an<br/>
environment in which he will be willing to listen to your dd. Fighting<br/>
it in court should be a last resort, as homeschooling just can&#39;t hold<br/>
up when parents disagree. Even in the case of parents married and<br/>
living under the same household you have to have agreement for<br/>
homeschooling to happen.<br/>

<br/>
Rather than putting what you want first, put your daughter first. I  <br/>
know you think it&#39;s one and the same but since your husband doesn&#39;t  <br/>
want the same solution you do, you&#39;re ending up in a fight over your  <br/>
solutions rather than either of you helping your daughter.<br/>
<br/>
You might want to look into Non-Violent Communication. Maybe someone  <br/>
here can provide some links and books if you&#39;re interested.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than calling what he&#39;s doing &quot;a game&quot; assume he wants the best  <br/>
for her. That *is* what he&#39;s trying to do. And as Ren said, work with  <br/>
him rather than against him. Talk about your daughter&#39;s happiness  <br/>
rather than the solution you think will achieve that.<br/>

One of the things the courts weigh heavily in determining &quot;the best <br/>
interests of the child&quot; is school attendance. We didn&#39;t even try to <br/>
pull my dss out of school until his mom agreed - although we sure <br/>
fantsized about it, validated his frustrations and did what we could <br/>
to make the experience less stressful for him. <br/>
<br/>
Can you hang out with your dd while she&#39;s doing homework and help <br/>
her out - tell her answers, read to her, etc? If your ex sees you <br/>
are willing to help with school he&#39;s more likely to treat you as an <br/>
ally rather than an adversary. That&#39;s important. <br/>

Yes, and the fight between parents is FAR worse than anything<br/>
happening in school. I have a worst case scenario unfolding right in<br/>
front of me...though things are turning around for the one child.<br/>
<br/>
One of my best friends has been in a legal battle with the ex for 8<br/>
years, 2.5 of which are over custody of ONE child (out of four) and<br/>
homeschooling. It&#39;s torn the family to shreds. Three of her children<br/>
will not speak to her or have any contact with her (they hate both of<br/>
their parents, it&#39;s not a taking sides issue). I&#39;ve also watched her<br/>
life become completely and totally focused on court battles, without<br/>
any time or energy for her own interests. It&#39;s cost in depression,<br/>
stress and a family destroyed. Luckily they&#39;re emerging out the other<br/>
side we think, but 8 years? Ouch.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not worth it. Don&#39;t make Dad the bad guy, explain that he<br/>
believes he&#39;s doing his best and brainstorm ways to enter true<br/>
discussions as a family. If you can all put your differences aside, be<br/>
willing to give (possibly a lot right now) and show that coming to a<br/>
place of support for each other is more important than your own ideas,<br/>
you MIGHT have a chance to repair damage and be a parental unit that<br/>
puts the child first. That is more important than schooled or<br/>
not-schooled in my opinion. <br/>
