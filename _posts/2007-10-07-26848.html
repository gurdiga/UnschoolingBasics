<div id="ygrps-yiv-960929118">I am having an issue involving my 10.5 y/o dd. I am not parenting her<br/>
the way I&#39;d like to recently. (also we just had a baby a week ago and<br/>
I am very short on energy)  I feel like I have run out of creativity<br/>
and patience and perspective. She is beginning the &quot;pre-teen&quot; years<br/>
and embracing others ideas of what that means. I know that mostly she<br/>
is just trying stuff out to see if it works but some of it is really<br/>
affecting me (and the family). She seems (by her words and actions) to<br/>
be dissatisfied with everything. Like this morning, I had my dh pick<br/>
up some donuts on his way home from Home Depot so we didn&#39;t have to<br/>
stop in the middle of a project and fix breakfast. dd doesn&#39;t usually<br/>
eat donuts, she doesn&#39;t prefer them. So I ask dh to pick her up a<br/>
bagel instead and the kind of donut I last remember her eating (just<br/>
in case) I didn&#39;t ask her because she was still sleeping and it didn&#39;t<br/>
seem like a good reason to wake her. When she wakes up I tell her papa<br/>
stopped and got donuts, she looks disappointed and says &quot;oh&quot;<br/>
dejectedly. But wants to check it out anyway. and we go downstairs<br/>
together. When we get there I show her the donut and she complains<br/>
that she hates that kind, she hasn&#39;t liked it in over a year. I say oh<br/>
yeah I had papa get you a bagel (no one else got a bagel). She pulls<br/>
the bagel out and says oh I only got a plain bagel, I like egg and<br/>
cheese on mine. I apologized for not getting the right thing (i had<br/>
forgotten that she preferred them this way) and offered to make her an<br/>
egg with cheese to put on the bagel. She says never mind and eats the<br/>
donut as though it is a chore. In the past she typically happy when we<br/>
got her things, even if they weren&#39;t exactly right. Now I feel like I<br/>
can&#39;t do anything right by her. And she&#39;ll say things to me like<br/>
&quot;well, that&#39;s what pre-teens do!&quot; as though that excuses meanness and<br/>
being callous to others. I don&#39;t understand this new era of<br/>
development and she is my oldest so this is totally new territory! I<br/>
don&#39;t really have a network of support irl so I am hoping that people<br/>
on here can help me get back on track with her. We are AP type parents<br/>
but I have no idea how to relate this to the older child, and I<br/>
definately don&#39;t want to parent in the traditional way or how I was<br/>
parented (which I have started to hear my parents twisted logic pop<br/>
out of my mouth, which is why I am asking for help!)<br/>
thanks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-445590243">Hi Faith~<br/>
<br/>
I understand how you feel. I too have dd&#39;s- well- 3 of them. 12, 9.5,  &<br/>
7 and I hear your sadness and frustration. I try to remember how I felt<br/>
at their ages and purpose not to take too much too personally. My 2<br/>
oldest can behave very erratically at times & then at others can be very<br/>
kind, giving and sweet. It is hard to always know how to respond or<br/>
react, but I can suggest you step back when she is like that and just<br/>
see her through it- it will pass. What I think they need most is our<br/>
stability and unconditional presence. What they are going through at<br/>
this age is new and maybe even a bit scary so our consistent patience<br/>
(and I understand you are tired) will help them feel safe. I thought<br/>
home schooling would cause an almost complete escape from many of the<br/>
issues I was warned about (ughhh- insensitive people!) -it has made it<br/>
more tolerable and we have plenty of time to talk through things- but<br/>
developmental stuff happens. As Moms, I think we take soooo much to<br/>
heart and just want to please and shelter our kids from any pain, but as<br/>
we all know the hard times are what propels us toward growth and<br/>
maturity- IMO- of course. We can&#39;t change everything but we can help by<br/>
being present, offering lots of hugs and an always open ear,  providing<br/>
as healthy of an environment as possible, and empowering them by<br/>
trusting that they will succeed and overcome whatever comes their way. I<br/>
hope that encourages you. Remember too that you are at a new time also<br/>
and allow your dd to see you  learning to adjust to change (with your<br/>
new baby- congratulations!) That in itself is life altering and<br/>
intimidating in some ways- perhaps to her as well as you. I remember<br/>
when each of my babies were born and it is as much of a challenge for<br/>
the other people in the family as it is for us.<br/>
((hugs 2 u))<br/>

<br/>
As to what you can *do* about that? Mostly just be aware that she&#39;s <br/>
going through a transitional time and transitions are never easy. <br/>
Beyond that, take your cues from her - even though they will <br/>
undoubtably be very very mixed. She may be wanting to be alone more, <br/>
for example, to process some of these big new ideas, and <br/>
simultaneously want to stay as distracted as possible so that she <br/>
doesn&#39;t *have* to think. Do you see how those conflicting urges <br/>
might lead to her being hard to get along with? <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She seems (by her words and actions) to<br/>
&gt; be dissatisfied with everything.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Does she seem to be looking for new directions to go in overall? She <br/>
may *be* dissatisfied in a sort of general sense. Nothing feels like <br/>
it &quot;fits&quot; anymore, on a conceptual level. Maybe she needs to find a <br/>
new interest that she can grow into (although I&#39;d be willing to bet <br/>
she&#39;d be at least as intimidated as excited by the idea). Depending <br/>
on how she is overall, she may be looking for totally new things to <br/>
read or watch or do, totally new people to hang out with. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; (also we just had a baby a week ago and<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, that&#39;s an added challenge, for sure. She may even feel torn <br/>
between playing caretaker and getting as far away from the baby as <br/>
possible *and* wanting her mommy back (and wanting mommy to leave <br/>
her alone and let her figure out what she wants dangit). Aaaaaaack! <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, try to keep in mind that her *needs* are changing. They&#39;re <br/>
still the same concrete human needs of food and rest and comfort and <br/>
all that, but she is starting to have more conceptual needs, too, <br/>
that she&#39;s having trouble identifying and expressing. <br/>
<br/>
Sorry not to be more helpful!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1734166663">I wanted to respond to this as my daughter is also 10.5 and is going <br/>
through a challenging time of both pushing me away and needing more at <br/>
times. She can be very angry and sad at times and especially angry at me <br/>
and I find that very difficult. She says things to me and I feel so sad <br/>
and hurt afterwards. it is taking a huge amount of energy to continue to <br/>
just be there for her- to care for myself in ways that allow those hurt <br/>
feelings to pass so I can move on with her. She is very envious of her <br/>
brother who is 14 and has many passions and friends. She wants friends <br/>
but is having difficulty connecting in the situations we are in and has <br/>
had difficult times with a couple friends lately. She is just going <br/>
through a large change, overall. She is beginning to find new interests- <br/>
which is really exciting, but the friends part isn&#39;t falling into place <br/>
and I feel like I really am not able to help her with this(though I will <br/>
keep trying) - she just isn&#39;t willing as much anymore to do things she <br/>
doesn&#39;t prefer in order to be part of a group or be with another person <br/>
and her interests are getting really specific. This is okay except she <br/>
feels sad and lonely. I am her main connection. It will take time and <br/>
just being with all the emotions for her and for myself is important <br/>
right now. I am needing to drop some other things to give her more time. <br/>
The idea that kids just gradually need less attention as they grow is a <br/>
false one as they at times need so much going through transitions such <br/>
as entering the teen years. This has been a challenge for me to accept.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter needs sleep next to me sometimes, needs to be taken lots of <br/>
places, needs lots of treats and new things and supplies for projects, <br/>
needs especially to be reassured constantly in many ways that she is <br/>
important and worth my time and resources.<br/>
<br/>
My son went through this at one point- growing away from friends in the <br/>
midst of finding new interests, but he has found a couple of things he <br/>
loves to do with friends and in general is a more accommodating person- <br/>
or is with friend that he likes, anyway. He is willing to work at <br/>
finding things to enjoy together. He very seemed discontent for a while <br/>
also.<br/>
