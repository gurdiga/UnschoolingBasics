<div id="ygrps-yiv-366839630">I just returned from the 5th annual Live and Learn unschooling<br/>
conference last night. Suffice it to say, it was a magical and<br/>
empowering week...once again. The hotel in Albuquerque was magnificent!<br/>
<br/>
It was so great to see familiar faces and meet some new ones. So much<br/>
incredible energy was shared all week and new connections made. I<br/>
can&#39;t put into words how it feels to be surrounded by your &quot;tribe&quot;.<br/>
I&#39;m so grateful for this event that has created a diverse and rich<br/>
community.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone here missed this year and wants to attend, it&#39;s not too<br/>
early to start planning for next year!! Asheville NC is next year&#39;s<br/>
location and it&#39;s going to be an awesome event. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to spend some time processing last week and all the great<br/>
things that happened....I&#39;ll post to my blog as soon as I get it all<br/>
distilled (and some photos developed). It&#39;s good to be back online.:)<br/>

I&#39;m back too! Live and Learn was amazing. I&#39;ve got a couple of photos up on my blog with more to come. I&#39;ve also got some pics and musings from my trip to DC, London and Paris. It&#39;s been great to get to travel so much, but it&#39;s good to be home for awhile! I look forward to getting back into the conversations here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-910041295">Ren, I can&#39;t wait to hear all about it! I&#39;m hoping to be able to talk <br/>
my husband into going to the 2007 conference. I know the kids would <br/>
love it! I&#39;ve been reading people&#39;s experiences at this year&#39;s <br/>
conference & it sounds awesome!<br/>
