<div id="ygrps-yiv-969661312">Just a quick reminder for anyone who still wanted to participate in the <br/>
December edition of Unschooling Voices. Please have your submissions e-<br/>
mail by the last day of the month (which is this Thursday). The <br/>
question of the month is always optional...anything unschooling related <br/>
is accepted. <br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t have a blog, feel free to answer the question here and <br/>
I&#39;ll just copy and include your post with the others. :-) <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the link:<br/>
