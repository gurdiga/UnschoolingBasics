How old is he?  My son went through this.  He (and<br/>
later my daughter) didn&#39;t really say any words until<br/>
he was 3 years old.  He had his hearing checked & my<br/>
son had tubes put in his ears (I now realize this was<br/>
most likely unnecessary).  Anyway, we had a early<br/>
intervention person come to our house every week for<br/>
quite awhile.  She just played games with him to<br/>
encourage him to use his words.  She finally admitted<br/>
that she wasn&#39;t doing anything I wasn&#39;t already doing<br/>
myself.  AND that the studies show that early<br/>
intervention doesn&#39;t really make a difference (as long<br/>
as there isn&#39;t any underlying physical problem).  Kids<br/>
who start speaking later, do just that.  Start later,<br/>
but catch up fast once they start.  The intervention<br/>
person was nice, but it was still stressful to all of<br/>
us.  It was a relief when we quit.  We never agreed to<br/>
go with my dd - which was several years later.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My son was seen by an early intervention specialist too.  He looked<br/>
forward to it as play time.  he went because at 2 1/2 his word was<br/>
&quot;ball&quot; - no sentances, a few other words used basically as commands,<br/>
and not much else.  That was when he was evaluated.  3 months later,<br/>
when the specialist came for his first session, he was speaking simple<br/>
sentences, following directions and interacting with people verbally -<br/>
granted it was still mostly ball related, but it had branched out some<br/>
(I still don&#39;t know where he picked up such a passion for sports -<br/>
neither Amy nor I care for sports in general and we rarely even watch<br/>
anything).  She worked on developing sentance structure, did some sign<br/>
language (he&#39;s not deaf, but apparently it helps develop verbal<br/>
skills), and played some skill building games which he loved.  when he<br/>
was re-evaluated after 6 months, he tested at high average verbally<br/>
and no longer qualified for speech.  I don&#39;t know how much the therapy<br/>
had to do with that, but I know it was not wholly due to it because he<br/>
had developed so much between his initial evaluation and his first<br/>
evaluation.  The therapist even said that this was not the child she<br/>
expected to be working with.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think she did anything detrimental though, and as I said,<br/>
Zachary really enjoyed it.  <br/>

We are teaching our daughter Zoe sign language on our own.  She is<br/>
almost a year old now.<br/>

Just so you know, my brother didn&#39;t start talking until he was over <br/>
three years old.  There were no medical problems, he was just a late <br/>
talker.<br/>

I think this is a wonderful thing!  I have known of families doing <br/>
this, and what a wonderful way to help the young ones communicate <br/>
effectively.  It empowers them reducing stress for both the parents <br/>
and the wee ones.  I just love it!<br/>
