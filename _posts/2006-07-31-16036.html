<div id="ygrps-yiv-1320533979">From a member I think might like to remain anon for this one:<br/>
<br/>
One of the boys didn&#39;t shut the door on the big freezer all the way<br/>
yesterday, and ruined about $200 worth of food.  Maybe more, I am<br/>
trying to salvage some of it. DH was so furious at them, yelling<br/>
cursing and informing them they were going to school so they could<br/>
learn something!  Both of them have been told many times they have to<br/>
push on the door of the freezer to make sure they have shut it all the<br/>
way.  Not only that they have also been told not to open the freezer. <br/>
<br/>
This happened yesterday after returning home from delgrosso amusement<br/>
park, where we went to get their baseball trophies, but did not stay<br/>
all afternoon to go on rides as planned due to their disobedient<br/>
behavior the night before.  they were told that night that they would<br/>
not be able to go if they continued their behavior, and J even said,<br/>
ok! in the morning I said to DH, lets go and get the trophies and then<br/>
come home.  So that&#39;s what we did.  I did purchase tickets to go on<br/>
one ride.  Jeffrey was very upset that we couldn&#39;t do anything else. <br/>
So much for not wanting to punish, eh?<br/>
I had a<br/>
conversation with them both about what it means when we say Stop and<br/>
Don&#39;t.  They just don&#39;t care, they want to do what they want to do!<br/>
Yes I want them to be free and do what they want, as long as it does<br/>
not conflict with what they have been told! I am so tired of their<br/>
wilful destructive behavior. Maybe I should just give in and send them<br/>
to school! But that won&#39;t solve the behavior problems, it will just<br/>
cause more problems.  Any<br/>
ideas????</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-767094604">You taught your children many lessons through this episode. You taught them<br/>
that it is acceptable to treat people we love like crap when they make<br/>
mistakes.<br/>
<br/>
You also taught them that their feelings and sense of well being are worth<br/>
$200 to you and your husband. What a petty amount to loose your child&#39;s<br/>
trust over.  It&#39;s a shame that your children aren&#39;t worth more than that to<br/>
you and it&#39;s also a shame that they know it. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1276368739">Sorry to hear that you&#39;ve lost so much in food. I hope that you can replace it easily - I know something like that could set us way back. <br/>
   <br/>
  I think the best thing you can do is calmly explain once again to the boys about the need to push the lid fully closed in the future so that this doesn&#39;t happen again. Let them help with trying to salvage anything, bagging up anything that can&#39;t be saved and then cleaning out the freezer before anything is readdef or brought in. If you can, have them go with you to shop for new stuff, but show them your usual budget and how this is setting you back (if it is) or coming out of savings or however you&#39;re handling it. <br/>
   <br/>
  We&#39;ve had the same situation happen, although at a time when the freezer wasn&#39;t completely stocked. I still had Sarah and Logan go through and clean out the freezer, help with moving everything that was alright into the small freezer (which was usually empty or just had ice cream and treats in it - because then they didn&#39;t NEED to go out into the big freezer for anything!). We haven&#39;t had a problem since then with them not ensuring the lid was fully closed although now that I&#39;ve written that I think keeping the treats in the small freezer in the house is the main thing we&#39;ve done that&#39;s helped. <br/>
   <br/>
  Now if we could get them to remember to shut the refrigerator (the door is broken so it doesn&#39;t shut properly unless you force it shut)....<br/>
   <br/>
  I hope that helps some!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If there is any way at all that you can try in your heart of hearts <br/>
to imagine someone saying all these things about you:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;disobedient behavior&quot;<br/>
&quot;[she] just [doesn&#39;t] care&quot;<br/>
&quot;[she] want[s] to do what they want to do!<br/>
&quot;wilful destructive behavior&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now, try to imagine that you&#39;re a kid (age unknown) who goofed up and <br/>
forgot to shut the freezer door, allowing food to spoil.  Imagine how <br/>
you&#39;d feel.  You&#39;d probably feel bad and angry with yourself.  I know <br/>
I would.  Now, imagine that your mom and/or dad comes along and goes <br/>
completely off on you, screaming and cursing.   You might feel any or <br/>
all of these few things:<br/>
<br/>
You might feel, &quot;She&#39;s right, I&#39;m stupid.&quot;<br/>
You might feel, &quot;I can&#39;t do anything right, who cares anyway.  Why <br/>
should I even try?&quot;<br/>
You might feel, &quot;I hate you!&quot;<br/>
You might feel, &quot;Good!  I&#39;m glad the food spoiled.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
None of these things is a good way to feel.<br/>
<br/>
Now, imagine if your mom or dad were sympathetic to you!  Imagine <br/>
hearing their legitimate disappointment on the one hand that the food <br/>
was spoiled but at the same time recognizing how crummy *you* must be <br/>
feeling about having goofed up.  Imagine if they gave you a way to <br/>
help right the wrong by helping them salvage the food, and then <br/>
imagine them asking you help come up with ways that they can help you <br/>
remember to shut the freezer door better.<br/>
<br/>
Imagine the difference between someone you love seeing you as being <br/>
willfully destructive versus them seeing you as fallible but caring <br/>
and capable and recognizing the humanity in you and themselves.  Can <br/>
you imagine how grateful you&#39;d feel for their support of you, even <br/>
when you&#39;re feeling so badly that you allowed $200 worth of food to spoil?<br/>
<br/>
The dynamic that has been set up between you and them is entirely up <br/>
to you and your husband, not them.  It&#39;s all in the way that you <br/>
respond to them being kids.  Kids goof up!  People goof up!  It&#39;s <br/>
what you do next that determines what they do next.  It&#39;s a great big <br/>
game or a dance and you&#39;re the leader.  If they&#39;re not listening to <br/>
you now, it&#39;s probably because you&#39;ve given them the message long ago <br/>
that listening to you hurts.  You can fix that, and they&#39;re always <br/>
giving you the opportunity to show them you can see them in a different way!<br/>
<br/>
If you haven&#39;t yet, get a copy of &quot;How to Talk So Kids Will Listen, <br/>
and Listen So Kids Will Talk.&quot;  I don&#39;t buy everything they say, but <br/>
it&#39;ll certainly help you turn things around from where they are!<br/>

at closing the freezer door by going to school? Could<br/>
you involve them in salvaging the food? Could you<br/>
involve them in your budget and in deciding what needs<br/>
to be dropped because the money now needs to go for<br/>
groceries. I don&#39;t mean this in a punishment sort of<br/>
way, but the way you would deal with this if either<br/>
you or dh left the door open by mistake.<br/>
<br/>
For several years we had an old refrigerator whose<br/>
door didn&#39;t close by simply letting go a couple inches<br/>
away. You really had to close it. At the same time, we<br/>
had many women going in and out of the house who used<br/>
our refrigerator for their lunch/snacks. I had told<br/>
all of them about the door and yet I had to check on<br/>
it myself and close it many time. Because I cared the<br/>
most the electric bill and the food in the<br/>
refrigerator. It just was not high on the other<br/>
women&#39;s priorities. And these were all grown women.<br/>
<br/>
You didn&#39;t mention the age of your boys and how long<br/>
have you been homeschooling/unschooling. You talk<br/>
about them disbeying but don&#39;t mention any specifics.<br/>
What behaviour is it that needs to be changed? I think<br/>
you&#39;ll get more helpful replies if you give specific<br/>
examples.<br/>

 One of the boys didn&#39;t shut the door on the big freezer all the way<br/>

<br/>
 -=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
 I&#39;m sorry you lost all in your freezer. Been there. Done that.<br/>
<br/>
 As to the situation:<br/>
<br/>
  What if you or your husband had been the culprit? Would *you* then <br/>
have to go to school to learn something? Who would yell and curse at <br/>
you? If they aren&#39;t allowed to even open the freezer, how should they <br/>
know that it must be shut all the way?<br/>
<br/>
  You really need to look at it from the point of view of two little <br/>
boys who are *ONLY* eight and five. Their goal wasn&#39;t to ruin $200 <br/>
worth of food. It was to get ice or a Popsicle.<br/>
<br/>
 Accidents HAPPEN. Punishing for accidents makes people sneaky liars.<br/>

 This happened yesterday after returning home from delgrosso amusement<br/>
 park, where we went to get their baseball trophies, but did not stay<br/>
 all afternoon to go on rides as planned due to their disobedient<br/>

 So much for not wanting to punish, eh?<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  What rule did they break the night before? How did it relate to the <br/>
amusement park? Why did you feel the need to punish at all?<br/>
<br/>
  They&#39;re REALLY little. Do you think they really understood your <br/>
arbitrary consequence? Why?<br/>
<br/>
  Where were you during this &quot;disobedience&quot; that &quot;caused&quot; the loss of <br/>
amusement park privilege? Why weren&#39;t you right here? Could it have <br/>
been caused by hunger? Exhaustion? Pain?<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  I had a conversation with them both about what it means when we say <br/>
Stop and Don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Do *you* quit when *they* say Stop or Don&#39;t? I&#39;m sure they asked <br/>
repeatedly to stay at the amusement park. You refused to listen. What <br/>
do you think they learned from that?<br/>
<br/>
 --=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 They just don&#39;t care, they want to do what they want to do!<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Yes. So do I, and so do you.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Yes I want them to be free and do what they want, as long as it does<br/>
 not conflict with what they have been told!<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 If one is truly FREE, he doesn&#39;t *have* to do what he is told.<br/>
<br/>
  What if *I* told *you*: &quot;You can do whatever you want as long as it&#39;s <br/>
what I say.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  I am so tired of their wilful destructive behavior. Maybe I should <br/>
just give in and send them<br/>
  to school! But that won&#39;t solve the behavior problems, it will just <br/>
cause more problems. Any<br/>
 ideas????<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 They may feel safer in school. Home seems spiteful and unreasonable.<br/>
<br/>
  Have you ever looked at it from *their* perspective? They are really, <br/>
really little. They need *help* in navigating this path. You&#39;re so busy <br/>
throwing up roadblocks that they can&#39;t even SEE the road!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-566929065">&quot;Imagine the difference between someone you love seeing you as being<br/>
willfully destructive versus them seeing you as fallible but caring<br/>
and capable and recognizing the humanity in you and themselves.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is SO important in an unschooling family. We ALL make mistakes.<br/>
It&#39;s interesting that adults think it&#39;s ok to treat children a certain<br/>
way when an honest mistake happens, but it would be considered abuse<br/>
if they treated another adult that way.<br/>
<br/>
If my dh screamed and cursed at me, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d stay married to<br/>
him!! Children don&#39;t have the power to get away from their parents,<br/>
they don&#39;t truly have that freedom usually. So parents should try<br/>
really, really hard to give children the same respect they&#39;d give<br/>
another adult...while understanding that they ARE children and are<br/>
going to make mistakes like that.<br/>
<br/>
When we lived in Battleground WA, I canned and froze food all summer.<br/>
We had a huge, old house with a full size fridge and freezer in the<br/>
basement. One summer, after I had spent two DAYS shucking, blanching<br/>
and freezing corn from the garden. Talk about HOURS of work! I also<br/>
had freezer jam I&#39;d made, Halibut and salmon I caught in Alaska and a<br/>
bunch of other food in there. The door got left open all night after<br/>
the boys got a popsicle. Talk about heartwrenching.<br/>
<br/>
Those little boys (7 and 3 at the time I believe) are now 16 and<br/>
12...the food is long forgotten. It&#39;s amazing how we can get upset at<br/>
something that seems like a really big deal at the time (and yes, it<br/>
hurts to lose $200 worth of food) but it will not be important down<br/>
the road. What IS of huge importance, is your relationship with them.<br/>
<br/>
Money comes and goes, food pretty much goes!:) Your children are<br/>
hopefully here to stay and they need parents that create a loving,<br/>
nurturing and supportive environment for them. Threats, yelling,<br/>
cursing and anger do not support them as they grow, it only causes<br/>
them to lose trust in their parents, themselves and their world.<br/>
<br/>
Not the best environment for joyful unschooling to take place. <br/>
I suggest viewing them as perfect, beautiful human beings that are<br/>
learning and growing. Obedience is not an ideal trait for an<br/>
unschooler in my opinion. Choosing to obey a directive because it<br/>
makes sense is one thing, blind obedience is what you&#39;re asking for<br/>
though and that isn&#39;t honoring the child or their own intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
Work WITH them, not against them. They are very little boys and what<br/>
you&#39;re doing to them today, is building a relationship with two<br/>
teenagers and men. Treat them as the men they are going to become (as<br/>
far as respect) while letting them be the small people they ARE.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1344235097">I&#39;m seeing a lot of posts here that are suggesting sensitivity and<br/>
forgiveness as the way to deal with this, and if this was a matter of the<br/>
boys opening the freezer with permission and not closing it completely<br/>
(perhaps they were helping to put things away) then I agree. Reminding them<br/>
that they really need to be careful when closing the door and having them<br/>
help with the clean-up while still treating them respectfully would be the<br/>
best way to deal with this.<br/>
<br/>
I must say though, that this is not the way that I read the original email.<br/>
It sounded to me as if the boys were purposefully being disobedient. They<br/>
were told not to touch the freezer. They did so anyway (perhaps because they<br/>
were angry about the trip to get the trophies?) and left the door open.<br/>
Perhaps that part was completely an accident, but regardless---if the<br/>
&#39;accident&#39; happened as a result of purposeful disobedience it should have<br/>
consequences.<br/>
<br/>
Sending them to school is not a consequence; that just seems a bit silly to<br/>
me. It was said in anger (none of us are the perfect parents that we aspire<br/>
to be) and should be forgotten.<br/>

door open and caused $200 worth of food to be lost?  Would he scream<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t understand how an amusement park and freezer are related.  And<br/>
I doubt that your very young children do either.  And why is there<br/>
need of a punishment?  Will a punishment help them remember to close<br/>
the freezer?  No.  It will help them remember that you don&#39;t trust<br/>
them and that you would prefer them to feel miserable at making<br/>
mistakes, thus feel miserable about themselves.  They probably do<br/>
understand that this accident was their fault, but that is all it was.<br/>
 An accident.  I doubt that your children deliberately went and left<br/>
the freezer door open to cause all that food to go to waste.  I&#39;m sure<br/>
that they would have prefered to have eaten the food rather than let<br/>
it go to waste.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is that so wrong?  Is it so wrong to want to do things that you want<br/>
to do?  What is it that they do that you feel needs to be stopped and<br/>
that they can&#39;t do?  I&#39;m wondering if more mindful parenting could<br/>
have prevented this accident.  Instead of saying, &quot;You many NEVER go<br/>
into the freezer again&quot; you could just as easily say, &quot;When you need<br/>
something from the freezer, let me know and I will help you since that<br/>
door has problems shutting all the way.&quot;  Or be aware of when they<br/>
have been in the freezer.  Check it from time to time to make sure it<br/>
is closed yourself.  Before you leave the house or go to bed.  Make it<br/>
part of your routine.  Is there something that is causing it to keep<br/>
from closing properly?  A broken hinge, too much ice, overstuffed<br/>
freezer, unlevel freezer.  (BTW, a friend of mine who used to sell<br/>
kitchen appliances told me that refrigerators are meant to close on<br/>
their own if they are level, if your fridge doesn&#39;t close on it&#39;s own<br/>
then it isn&#39;t level.  Same for stand up freezers.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Yes I want them to be free and do what they want, as long as it does<br/>
&gt; not conflict with what they have been told! I am so tired of their<br/>
&gt; wilful destructive behavior.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do you really think that they say to themselves, &quot;Hey, I know mom told<br/>
us not to do this, but let&#39;s see how much damage we can cause?&quot;<br/>
Children don&#39;t think like that.  IN fact few people truly think like<br/>
that.  Sometimes things just happen like freezer doors being left<br/>
open.  BTW, did you know that you can purchase a device that goes on<br/>
your freezer or refrigerator door that sends out an beep or some such<br/>
noise to let you know that the freezer door is open?  They cost around<br/>
$10 and it would be  an audible reminder to your boys (and you and<br/>
your husband) that the door is still open.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-262247437">&quot;Oooh I really really like this - it says clearly and simply something<br/>
that is so important.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A few years ago I started picturing them as adults remembering this<br/>
very moment with me. I imagined them as grown men (or women as the<br/>
case may be), remembering their childhood and how I hoped they&#39;d feel<br/>
about our interactions and their parents.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t want them to grow up with the kind of visions I have of my<br/>
Mom ranting all the time when she got pissed (though I&#39;ve been known<br/>
to rant on occasion!).<br/>
<br/>
Seeing them as grown men/women, really helped me treat them<br/>
differently. That can be a useful tool for creating change in<br/>
relationships. I&#39;m not acting out on a 5 year old, I&#39;m acting out on<br/>
JALEN, who I assume will one day be a man that is larger and stronger<br/>
than me.:)<br/>

This list is here to help people move AWAY from punishment into<br/>
non-adversarial relationships. So no, I don&#39;t believe there should be<br/>
&quot;consequences&quot; other than the very natural ones of losing food.<br/>
<br/>
What would the &quot;consequence&quot; be if your husband did something? What if<br/>
my dh punished me for not cleaning the kitchen or breaking something?<br/>
How is it that healthy relationships for adults don&#39;t involve<br/>
punishment of any kind, but it&#39;s alright for children? <br/>

 </span></blockquote>In my mind, though, I wonder why the relationship would be set up <br/>
where the kids would *want* to purposefully disobey!?  This ain&#39;t <br/>
about the freezer door or $200 bucks worth of food!  This sounds a <br/>
lot like an us-versus-them scene, and unschooling cannot work in that <br/>
environment!  If the grown-up folks are coming off as authoritarian <br/>
and creating situations for the kids to rebel against, how can that <br/>
foster the kind of trust between the parents and the kids that is <br/>
absolutely crucial for unschooling to work?<br/>
<br/>
If, as you think, this was done as a result of &quot;purposeful <br/>
disobedience,&quot; the consequences are the parents&#39; to pay, and <br/>
&quot;purposeful disobedience&quot; is actually the consequence of a lack of <br/>
trust and respect.<br/>

P.S.  Whenever I have told my son not to &quot;touch&quot; something, the first <br/>
thing he would do is hold up his pointer finger and touch the thing <br/>
while looking at me with a little smile on his face.  This shows me <br/>
what a dolt I&#39;m being and that he deserves better than that!  Then, <br/>
he gives me the chance to amend my goofy statement to why I&#39;d like <br/>
him (or need him) to leave that thing alone for now.  If my <br/>
explanation passes muster, he&#39;s more than happy to comply.  (He&#39;s <br/>
done this since he was very little; he would probably do it now, but <br/>
I have long since learned not to say insulting things like that to <br/>
him.)  This is as it should be, and I am ever grateful for my <br/>
intelligent, patient, funny, good-natured son!!! <br/>

Why not just fix the freezer door so it shuts like it&#39;s made to? It&#39;s  free.<br/>

Adjust the front feet of the fridge. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Could be that they were just being little kids and not being able to  <br/>
hold it in their heads that closing the freezer door was important.  <br/>
That kind of thing is just totally normal - their brains are so  <br/>
young, they don&#39;t have the cognitive capability that would allow them  <br/>
to hold these abstract ideas in their heads - freezer door doesn&#39;t  <br/>
shut tight, stuff in the freezer has to stay cold to stay good, it  <br/>
would cost money to replace stuff in freezer, we don&#39;t have an  <br/>
infinite supply of money, we have to work to earn money, if we  <br/>
replace things in freezer then we have to give up something else, and  <br/>
so on. Those are very abstract thoughts that adults process instantly  <br/>
and effortlessly, but the brains of kids under 12 or so aren&#39;t  <br/>
developed in the areas that are needed for that kind of thinking.<br/>
<br/>
The solution has to be concrete, to match the kids thinking levels -  <br/>
it might be to find a way to fix the freezer so it closes tightly by  <br/>
itself or to get a little alarm for it for when the door is open -  <br/>
ask the kids, they&#39;ll have lots of ideas.<br/>
<br/>
It might help parents to think about how they want their children to  <br/>
treat THEM, when they&#39;re old and feeble and make mistakes. How do  <br/>
they want their kids to treat them when THEY are old and they do  <br/>
things like leave the freezer door open. Lots of us WILL be like that  <br/>
- it is very often part of getting old. I&#39;m hoping my children will  <br/>
be tender and kind to me, when I&#39;m like that. I hope they won&#39;t be  <br/>
harsh and disapproving and I certainly hope they won&#39;t consider  <br/>
punishing me<br/>
<br/>
Could be that they were being disobedient on purpose. That can happen  <br/>
when kids and parents have such a severely adversarial relationship  <br/>
that the children actually start to see the parents as &quot;the enemy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
IF that is true, then the parents really need even more help figuring  <br/>
out how to create a non-adversarial relationship with their children.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1610037140">Ok, so I&#39;ve read all the responses to this initial post from the anon<br/>
member... I want to hear a response back from the anon member on what<br/>
she thinks of what everyone said.<br/>
<br/>
What have you planned to do to fix the situation in your home?  Why<br/>
are your children the &quot;bad guys&quot;?  Are you willing to change?<br/>
<br/>
I really want to know if you reread what you posted to the group to<br/>
see just how harsh you and your DH are being with your boys... do you<br/>
see how you are the one&#39;s causing the conflict?  Do you see that you<br/>
as adults are totally responsible for how you react to your children?  <br/>
<br/>
I can say that we all aren&#39;t perfect but we are actively involved in<br/>
making our lives full of joy and living unschooling to the fullest. <br/>
Right now your household is NOT living unschooling... but it can be...<br/>
but first you have to acknowledge the issues... and the issues are NOT<br/>
your children... the issues are with you and your DH.<br/>

&gt; One of the boys didn&#39;t shut the door on the big freezer all the way<br/>
&gt; yesterday, and ruined about $200 worth of food.  Maybe more, I am<br/>
&gt; trying to salvage some of it. DH was so furious at them, yelling<br/>
&gt; cursing and informing them they were going to school so they could<br/>
&gt; learn something!  Both of them have been told many times they have to<br/>
&gt; push on the door of the freezer to make sure they have shut it all the<br/>
&gt; way.  Not only that they have also been told not to open the freezer. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This happened yesterday after returning home from delgrosso amusement<br/>
&gt; park, where we went to get their baseball trophies, but did not stay<br/>
&gt; all afternoon to go on rides as planned due to their disobedient<br/>
&gt; behavior the night before.  they were told that night that they would<br/>
&gt; not be able to go if they continued their behavior, and J even said,<br/>
&gt; ok! in the morning I said to DH, lets go and get the trophies and then<br/>
&gt; come home.  So that&#39;s what we did.  I did purchase tickets to go on<br/>
&gt; one ride.  Jeffrey was very upset that we couldn&#39;t do anything else. <br/>
&gt; So much for not wanting to punish, eh?<br/>
