<div id="ygrps-yiv-499436107">I am a rare girl who does not enjoy talking on the phone much. But <br/>
there are exceptions, and one is when friends need me. Today one <br/>
called and I talked to her as I cleaned house and even vacumed. The <br/>
problem is, while I was doing that my daugher and my roomates son <br/>
both almost 5 years old where in my daughters room playing. I kept <br/>
checking in on them, I had asked them to clean the room up a little <br/>
but it was no biggie that they desided playing was better for them <br/>
at the time. Tired and stressed and worried about friends I sit down <br/>
on the couch, hang up the phone, close my eyes and breath trying to <br/>
tell myself it could be worse. My roomate is in the hospital because <br/>
of uncontrolable asmah (sp?) and another friend is getting a <br/>
divorce, mother is in the hospital as well recovering from a gastro, <br/>
and my bills are piling up so badly that I can not go see anyone to <br/>
help. I needed to breath. No sooner do I open them do I notice the <br/>
little boy running to his room, and my daughter coming to jump on <br/>
me. Ok, hug time, I know it will help. Only there is something <br/>
wrong, my daughter has her hair cut! OMG! One side of her head with <br/>
her hair cut up to her ear.... I just want to cry. I did not yell, <br/>
but I did do something I wish I hadn&#39;t. I asked her what she did to <br/>
her hair and I know I had anger in my voice. She said she cut it, <br/>
and I told her that was wrong and she was in trouble and I was going <br/>
to tell her Daddy. I made a big deal about it even though I tried <br/>
not to. I found myself saying far fewer words then I wanted to but <br/>
still said too much. She ran to her bathroom to hide! I talked to <br/>
Hubby, and he reminded me it is only hair and it will grow. HE was <br/>
the peaceful parent for once. Thats new for him. I came out of my <br/>
room to find my daughter had cleaned her whole room by herself! She <br/>
told me she wanted me to not cry. In the end Hubby is right, but <br/>
goddess I feel like a horrible mother now. I talked to Crystal about <br/>
it after and told her the truth, that I am upset not so much about <br/>
her hair but because she did not ask me first so I could help make <br/>
sure it was done nice. I told her I was upset because I did not see <br/>
her doing it because I was pre-ocupied with other things. I told her <br/>
that if she wants short hair she can tell me and that tomorrow <br/>
morning her Daddy is going to take her to get her hair cut and maybe <br/>
the hair dresser will let her help cut her hair. She then tells me <br/>
she wants to have boy hair... and all I could do was force a smile <br/>
and say oh. Then it hit me to be silly, so I told her maybe we could <br/>
make her blond hair blue! And she with such a streight face said no <br/>
she wants green hair. I was laughing so hard then with her! It <br/>
helped. <br/>
<br/>
 But still I am left with a terrible feeling that I am a horrible <br/>
mother. <br/>
<br/>
  My roomate calls and just has to shove the knife further by saying <br/>
her son did not know to come tell me about it because Crystal does <br/>
so many bad things that I let her do that he does not know what to <br/>
think. WHAT? Does bad things? Goddess she got me upset. But I did <br/>
not say anything. I know what she is thinking. I let my daughter <br/>
jump on her bed, make some of her own food, wear what she wants, <br/>
help me cook, chase the cats with a water bottle, stay up most all <br/>
night if she wants.... SHE is one to talk. Here is my vent, be <br/>
warned! She hits her child with objects even like a big brush, she <br/>
yells at him all the time, often for just wanting to hug her when <br/>
she is stressed. SHE is the one that took him yesterday to the <br/>
hospital for 6 hours with no food and nothing to do! She is the one <br/>
that smokes a pack a day even though she has lung problems and her <br/>
son is depending on her to be healthy and she just refuses to quit. <br/>
SHE is the one that lets her son play out side with no adult <br/>
watching and no older children right next to a road where anyone <br/>
could take him. SHE is the one who forces him to read or she will <br/>
not pay attention to him. SHE is the one that takes him to a party <br/>
with drinking adults, her one of them and a unlocked gun on top of a <br/>
fridge not to mention other things. So I am little stressed and <br/>
upset. She is in the hospital because of her habbits and I am here <br/>
taking care of her son and all the bills as she is not working. <br/>
<br/>
 I want to cry....<br/>
<br/>
 On a different note. Does anyone have any ideas on what I should do <br/>
about my pixie baby wanting different color hair? Is their any safe <br/>
hair die for her age, something that does not cost too much but that <br/>
we can change every so often? <br/>
<br/>
  Blessings,<br/>

<br/>
**It sounds like you were able to explain your reaction and make her feel<br/>
better, and you both ended up laughing.  We all mess up sometimes, Kimmy.<br/>
How we handle the messing up is important, and it sounds like you did great.<br/>
<br/>
If her hair is very blond you might be able to use kool-aid.  Also, CVS<br/>
carries a comb in color that washes out. It&#39;s a lot of fun.<br/>
<br/>
I would tell your roommate it&#39;s time to find another place to live.  Not<br/>
only is she adding stress to your life and interfering with your attempts to<br/>
build a better relationship with your daughter, but every time she hits her<br/>
son or demeans him your daughter internalizes that.   ~Rue<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1899978998">Gosh....<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I have bad days from time to time, too, doing things I just can&#39;t believe I did--things that are totally out of character or out of synch with my personal philosophies, but I get consistently better all the time.  So will you.<br/>
<br/>
Why not just get some spray in color.  It&#39;s like spray paint.  You can get it at Sally&#39;s, if there&#39;s one near you.  If you want to turn this into an interesting experiment, you can cook beats, or juice carrots, you can use spinach for green.  Use a little peroxide and shampoo along with the juice of whatever you use, and just shampoo in and rinse out.  Since your daughter is little, just use the regular peroxide, don&#39;t buy the 17 volume stuff.  Then, use a good conditioner.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter loves the spray paint kind and it&#39;s so easy, and easy to change.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun with it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s interesting, once we start allowing our children to be autonomous, there&#39;s no stopping them.  My daughter often reminds me that she is the one who gets to make the decisions about her dress, her hair, her diet, her education.  Each little step toward complete autonomy is a little painful for us, I think, because we were raised to believe that kids can&#39;t do a damned thing without being told.<br/>
<br/>
Lesson learned.<br/>
<br/>
Move on.<br/>

<br/>
Lots of people have used Kool Aid.<br/>
<br/>
If I were in your position I would evict your room-mate or find another home<br/>
myself if it is her lease. I have zero tolerance for smoking around my<br/>
child, and if she lives there then she must be smoking around your child as<br/>
well as her own. Nor do I allow Jayn to be around people who hit their<br/>
children if at all possible.<br/>
<br/>
This may not help you, but it seems like a self given haircut - a common<br/>
childhood action - pales into insignificance compared to having someone in<br/>
your home whose daily interactions with their own son are so very disruptive<br/>
to the peace of that home.<br/>

Weasley three times in his life so far, and we&#39;ve used the red <br/>
