<div id="ygrps-yiv-368760433">Hi my name is Cheryl.  My family and I have been unschooling for years now.  We moved back to Florida over a year ago after two years in California.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been part of a homeschooling eList in my county for about a year and recently I saw a post for an unschooling park day.  The boys and I jumped at the chance to meet some other unschoolers in our area, but I quickly realized that I was the only radical unschooler in attendance.  As the conversation progressed it became obvious to the other moms there as well! :)<br/>
<br/>
There were people who were truly interested in unschooling so I made a yahoo group for the purpose of listing some of my favorite unschooling links, books, etc.  Of course, this group is on there. <br/>
<br/>
We are hoping to meet weekly at the park, and I&#39;m hoping to make some good friends and be able to answer questions about unschooling as they come up.  Being back on this list and reading along will help me as I tend to get a little tongue tied, so thanks for still being around after all these years!<br/>
<br/>
Cheryl<br/>

ps- Hi to any old friends,  we were at Live And Learn in St. Louis.  We stayed in the hotel that was evacuated in the middle of the night for a false fire alarm!  We were also at the Legoland meetup a few years back.</div>
