<div id="ygrps-yiv-1875380216">I remember getting spanked.  Yes, it scared me, but it didn&#39;t deter me.  If<br/>
I grew up in these times instead of back then, I would have been on ritalin<br/>
through most of my childhood.  I wasn&#39;t a BAD kid - I just was very easily<br/>
distracted.  My parents thought that they could use the fear of spankings to<br/>
keep me on track  For example, I was supposed to clean the living room<br/>
before Dad got home from work.  What was supposed to happen was I would make<br/>
the decision to start cleaning to avoid the pain later on.  What happened<br/>
was that I would happily go along in my own little world until I heard the<br/>
car pulling into the driveway.  I would then make a DESPERATE attempt to<br/>
shove things under furniture and, as Dad came in, start crying in<br/>
anticipation of what I knew was going to come.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I also got spanked for things I didn&#39;t do.  My brother told a more<br/>
convincing story than I usually could - often I wasn&#39;t even aware of some of<br/>
the circumstances, so I never sounded convincing.  Usually the truth came<br/>
out and my parents were always apologetic afterwards, but somehow that<br/>
really didn&#39;t make things better.<br/>
<br/>
I know most people don&#39;t have these issues, but It is something I consider.<br/>
