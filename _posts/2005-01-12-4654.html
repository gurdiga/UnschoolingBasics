<br/>
Think of your kids in terms of your husband.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s say your husband was interested in birds and in the newspaper you read there was to be a bird watching class.  You might mention it to your husband.  He might want to go, might not.  If he didn&#39;t want to go, would you ask him why not, try to get him to go?  Probably not.  You would figure he has the information and knows best for himself if he is interested.<br/>
<br/>
If I come across something I think the kids might be interested in, I tell them about it.  That is about it.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, the best strewing around here is me getting interested in my own stuff.  I am big into organic gardening although I really suck at it.  I study women&#39;s spirituality and military strategy (how&#39;s that for a combo?) and I just got my first spinning wheel.<br/>
<br/>
My excitement tends to be infectious and off the kids go.<br/>

<br/>
You have to step back and trust them. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
 <br/>
What do you mean &quot;they aren&#39;t doing anything?&quot; Are they catatonic? Do  they <br/>
not eat? sleep? run? watch tv? play games? talk? read?<br/>
 <br/>
I was just there---and they were all doing *something*!<br/>
 <br/>
On the way home, James was talking about the army & marines and 50  caliber <br/>
guns and WWII flying aces and storming beaches! ----all SORTS of  things I know <br/>
nothing about! &lt;G&gt; So he&#39;s picking it up somewhere!<br/>
 <br/>
At CiCi&#39;s, he didn&#39;t shut up! He and Duncan have played well all evening.  <br/>
They had Miso soup and burritos and hot chocolate. They played video games (he&#39;d <br/>
 never played an X-box!) and jumped on the trampoline and talked about  <br/>
Yu-Gi-Oh! They found their birthdays on Duncan&#39;s new Yu-Gi-Oh! calendar. They  <br/>
stayed up and watched a new episode of Inuyasha. All this is just what I  <br/>
witnessed. Lots went on that I wasn&#39;t around to see.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You have to engage them and *be* with them and *do* with them.  It  involves <br/>
knowing what they like and helping them learn about that. It&#39;s also  about <br/>
throwing something new into the mix to see how they like that.<br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
&lt;BWG&gt; You&#39;ll know it when you know it. Kind of like falling in love!  &lt;G&gt; <br/>
Until you&#39;re there, you never quite sure whether it&#39;s *it*.<br/>

 <br/>
Think long and hard about the difference between teaching and  learning.<br/>
Think of your children as whole human beings NOW---not grubs waiting to  <br/>
become human.<br/>
Respect Who They Are ---NOW.<br/>
Trust that they WILL learn. That they are hard-wired to learn. That the  only <br/>
way to stop that innate desire to learn is to force it.<br/>
Find your own passion (art) and throw yourself into it. Let them *see* that  <br/>
passion. Know that modeling is the best way for them to learn from you.<br/>
Relax and let it come to you. *DO* the unschooling! *BE* the unschooler!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
An acquaintence GAVE it to me.  It wasn&#39;t in working condition so I went to a local wool market and asked around.  I found a guy who got in working condition for $100 and threw in an hour lesson.  <br/>
<br/>
I thought all wheels were basically the same but he said my wheel wasn&#39;t for beginners and to not be discouraged....but in his shop, he had me spinning on a Great Wheel within 5 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m having a ball and have visions of Angora goats mixing in with my dairy goats...we will see.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-789582934">This is quite true Ren!<br/>
<br/>
I know with my boys and their passions, sometimes they are just a<br/>
fleeting thing for a day or two, and others, like that of Yu-Gi-Oh are<br/>
the kind that they eat, sleep, dream, and absorb almost every waking<br/>
moment kind of a passion. Shoot even my hubby is into Yu-Gi-Oh with<br/>
the boys and has many decks and duels with them sometimes until all<br/>
hours of the night!:)LOL!! <br/>
<br/>
To quote from a few excerpts from my book &quot;One of the most exciting<br/>
aspects of Life Long Leaning is that of watching your children grow<br/>
and learn through their passions in life. At times these passions can<br/>
be quite intense, and other times they are often fleeting.<br/>
No, I am not describing a passionate romance between two people, but<br/>
rather a &quot;love affair&quot; of learning in a particular thing that<br/>
interests them. This is something can lead to a lifetime passion or<br/>
maybe even become your child&#39;s life career. Or, it could be something<br/>
that your child has an interest in for a day or two......Now, of<br/>
course, our boys have their share of ever fleeting love affairs with<br/>
certain passionate interests. There is the remote control cars, of<br/>
which they love playing with and troubleshooting when they break, but<br/>
once they are broken beyond foreseeable repair, they move on to the<br/>
next interest. There has been interests in rocks, paper mache, candle<br/>
making, writing on the white board in our bedroom (and sometimes they<br/>
will even write math problems along with their sketches and stories<br/>
they make on the board), sewing, guitar playing and many, many other<br/>
interests. Much more than I can ever write here!<br/>
One of the most wonderful parts of Life Long Learning is that we<br/>
simply have our whole lives to learn from as in-depth of an interest<br/>
as we wish, as well as the fleeting interests. The key is to get into<br/>
our children&#39;s&#39; passions with them and learn together. It can open up<br/>
the world to so many other connections of learning that you never even<br/>
dreamed possible!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In Love and Light,<br/>
