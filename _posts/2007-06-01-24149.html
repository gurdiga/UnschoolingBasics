<div id="ygrps-yiv-577729250">My firends child was taken by cps, moved around to several different foster homes, then placed into a psych hospital. Explaining the whole situation would take to long so Ill just say she was taken for bogus reasons,<br/>
   <br/>
  Ive went through the background check and when they return her home ( they claim soon) Ill be keeping her from about 2pm-1am. <br/>
   <br/>
  So my question....Do you have any suggestions on what to do help her heal from this ordeal? <br/>
   <br/>
  Also what if anything would you do to help her transition from being at my house where there and only a few limits to home and ugh! public school ....both places consisting of being told what to do when to do it. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-786215444">Hi Nicole, <br/>
<br/>
My three children had been in foster care for four years before we <br/>
met and adopted them. That temporary kind of lifestyle is very hard <br/>
on children and a lot develop some sort of attachment issues. Do a <br/>
search on it and see if anything applies. You (or her parents) can <br/>
take a look at my blog and click the &quot;adoption&quot; label in the sidebar <br/>
for more information or e-mail me offlist.    <br/>
<br/>
The best you can do is listen to her. Do they know if she was abused <br/>
in any way while in state care? Also, make sure the parents get <br/>
copies of the reports from the hospital. <br/>
<br/>
How well did you know this child before this happened? Did you have <br/>
a trusting relationship? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll keep her in my thoughts. Please let me know if I can help. <br/>
<br/>
