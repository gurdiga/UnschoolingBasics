<br/>
We&#39;re exploring the possibility of unschooling for our children (soon to be<br/>
5 and 3), but neither my wife nor I want to do it full time. My wife, who<br/>
works 30-40 hours/week in a highly responsible job, is less enthusiastic<br/>
about it than I am (I love the &quot;unschooling&quot; approach -- esp. Valerie&#39;s<br/>
&quot;guide&quot; description) and feels overwhelmed by the thought of it most times.<br/>
I love being with my daughters, but also enjoy working (as a<br/>
trainer/consultant, I have more flexibility) at least part time. My wife&#39;s<br/>
mother (speaks Bulgarian, very little English) also spends most of the year<br/>
with us (Sept - May).<br/>
<br/>
Our other option is an alternative school (Waldorf, Montessori, Sudbury<br/>
Valley).<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts about how we might make unschooling work without feeling<br/>
overwhelmed (or, somehow, negligent)?<br/>

&gt; &gt; It could be that as a beginner I don&#39;t quite get the philosophy of<br/>
&gt; many unschoolers - which is why I&#39;m on this list, to increase my<br/>
&gt; understanding - but what I am wondering is what you or other more<br/>
&gt; experienced homeschoolers think of as your role in terms of<br/>
&gt; facilitating learning for your kid(s) and is that pretty much the<br/>
&gt; same for all unschoolers or does it differ.  In other words, how do<br/>
&gt; you generally go about digging up possible resources that your kids<br/>
&gt; might be interested in for things they&#39;ve expressed interest in, or<br/>
&gt; thinking up ways they might enjoy expanding those interests.  And<br/>
&gt; how much do you leave up to them?  Is this something that has varied<br/>
&gt; over your years of unschooling with insight you have gained in the<br/>
&gt; process of unschooling?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ******You are your children&#39;s guide, but think about what a guide<br/>
&gt; does. If you go to a museum and a guide takes you to the different<br/>
&gt; displays he doesn&#39;t force you to look at each piece and study it and<br/>
&gt; write a report. He simply points it out to you and allows you the<br/>
&gt; freedom to put as much attention and effort into that piece as you<br/>
&gt; choose. He doesn&#39;t tell you that he will show you the next piece if<br/>
&gt; you say &quot;please&quot; or tell you that you don&#39;t get to see the next<br/>
&gt; piece because you didn&#39;t say &quot;thank you&quot; when he showed you the<br/>
&gt; prior piece. He doesn&#39;t tell you to be quiet and stay in a straight<br/>
&gt; line with your hands at your side. He doesn&#39;t monitor you to see<br/>
&gt; what you&#39;ve learned and degrade you if you were not interested. He<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t put conditions on sharing his knowledge. What he does do is<br/>
&gt; share his joy (if he&#39;s a good guide) of the museum and trust you to<br/>
&gt; take away what you will from the experience. That is the type of<br/>
&gt; guide our children need and deserve. They need a guide that trusts<br/>
&gt; them, respects them and is there to answer any questions they might<br/>
&gt; have about this great world of ours.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-429597528">Hi Mike,<br/>
<br/>
What are your children doing now? Are they staying home or in <br/>
daycare? If they&#39;re home now then things won&#39;t really change. The <br/>
children will be less overwhelming if they&#39;re home than if you have <br/>
to deal with what school would do to their personalities. <br/>
<br/>
Your job is flexible. Can you be there when your wife can&#39;t be? Can <br/>
your mother-in-law help out during the months she&#39;s there? The kids <br/>
will be exposed to Bulgarian so they&#39;ll have great communication <br/>
with their grandmother. <br/>
<br/>
Things usually seem overwhelming before they actually take place. <br/>
Once the unschooling starts (and maybe you&#39;re already unschooling?) <br/>
then things will fall into place and you&#39;ll work it all out.<br/>
<br/>
Your children are lucky. They have three adults giving them love and <br/>
attention. I doubt negligence will ever enter the picture. <br/>
<br/>
love, Valerie<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2110296213">Hi, Mike,<br/>
<br/>
I am new to unschooling also with 5 and 3 yr olds of my own.  I am just<br/>
wondering where you are located if you are considering Sudbury Valley - I&#39;m<br/>
not sure if there are many other Sudbury Valley&#39;s out there, but I&#39;m near<br/>
the one here in Framingham, MA.  I also have considered SVS, happen to know<br/>
four families who send their kids to SVS and have had long conversations<br/>
with a local unschooling family here in Natick where the Dad was a former<br/>
teacher there and shared some insights on the school with me.  I&#39;d be happy<br/>
to share thoughts on SVS with you off list if you would find that helpful or<br/>
are looking for that at all...<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
