<div id="ygrps-yiv-1361891109">thanks Joanne... thank goodness for my RU groups!  I just wish I had a local<br/>
RU friend... I live in Central IL and it&#39;s so mainstream here... not just<br/>
with homeschooling but with everything. it can get so frustrating and lonely<br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
not trying to be a downer... thank you (Moderators) for keeping this group<br/>
going... because loneliness is a real issue with unschooling sometimes.<br/>

church.  There are also quite a few UU churches that are very Christian<br/>
