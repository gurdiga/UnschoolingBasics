<div id="ygrps-yiv-2049441075">My now 10 y/o (only child)went through this periodically our first <br/>
few years after we pulled him out of school (kindergarten). Although <br/>
he hated the school part of it, he is a social butterfly and loved <br/>
the social aspects (and was quite popular). Of course, it didn&#39;t help <br/>
that after we pulled him out we moved 3 states away to a place where <br/>
we didn&#39;t know anybody! (It also doesn&#39;t help that he as a wallflower <br/>
for a mom!)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we&#39;ve had to be creative and seek out ways for him to be with <br/>
other kids. There aren&#39;t any kids in the neighborhood for him to play <br/>
with. We prefer unstructured social activities (think playdate <br/>
instead of karate class), but he has been involved in his share of <br/>
structured activities as a way to meet kids that we then have over <br/>
for unstructured time. The city we live in and the city right next to <br/>
us both offer different classes/activities for kids, which he&#39;s <br/>
participated in off and on for the last four years. His favorite is <br/>
called Kids Night Out, and takes place for 3 hours nearly every <br/>
friday of the school year. He&#39;s made some really good friends there, <br/>
and looks forward to it every week. Although my dh and I aren&#39;t <br/>
religeous, we&#39;ve found a church that we enjoy (Unitarian <br/>
Universalist) that has great kids programs. We also lucked out in <br/>
that about 1/3 of the kids who go there are homeschooled. <br/>
<br/>
Of all of the families we know, ours is the only one with an open <br/>
door policy for the kids. On weekends we may have a kid all day, or <br/>
all weekend. Kids love it at our house because they&#39;re allowed to <br/>
experiment, get dirty, and generally have fun. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1647944584">My boys are very antisocial and don&#39;t miss having friends at all, <br/>
but one thing they do is go to Playstation 2 tournaments at a local <br/>
library. They don&#39;t have any interest in sports or scouts, so aside <br/>
from Sunday school, this is probably the only social interaction <br/>
with kids their own age that they get. We go every month. The winner <br/>
get a $10 Archcard for McDonald&#39;s.<br/>
&#92;<br/>
Perhaps you could ask around at your local library to see if they <br/>
offer something like that? Perhaps you could start your own <br/>
tournaments? If he is not interested in something like this, maybe <br/>
you could find something else that does interest him?<br/>

I am actually known for always having extra kids at my house too. But  that&#39;s <br/>
usually on the weekends due to most family and friends are in  school.<br/>
But the days we are not doing anything or I am catching up on house work,  <br/>
that&#39;s when he gives me more trouble than the younger ones...simply because he  <br/>
wants ME to entertain him.   I spend extra time with him as often as I  can. <br/>
In fact, we have reading time every other night after the other kids go to  bed <br/>
where I spend an hour reading Harry Potter to him. I just think maybe he  <br/>
wants more than just me.<br/>

kids online gaming, there are some games (StarCraft for one that I <br/>
know of because my guys like it) where their Internet space can be <br/>
set up so only invited players can access a particular game. For <br/>
instance, DH can set up a game and invite DS and it is a private <br/>
game - no one else can barge in.<br/>
