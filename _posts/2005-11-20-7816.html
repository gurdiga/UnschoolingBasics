<div id="ygrps-yiv-72175041">Hi guys, I&#39;m not sure, but I THINK I have yet to post an intro here. <br/>
I joined so many unschooling groups at once (bad idea), I&#39;m losing <br/>
track! My name is Keri, I&#39;m 40 on the outside & maybe 10 on the <br/>
inside, live near the ocean north of Boston, and recently adopted my <br/>
daughter Anastasia, age 12-13, from Siberia. So, yes, I was in <br/>
Siberia in the dead of winter this year, but that&#39;s a story for <br/>
another yahoo group...<br/>
Anyway, I am working my way towards unschooling. Nast ( what she went <br/>
by in Russia) attends the local charter school about 3 days a week, <br/>
and I&#39;m tRYING to make it possible to have her home every day. Right <br/>
now I&#39;m trying to figure out how to do that while still working. She <br/>
can&#39;t be home alone just yet (RAD, PTSD and other stuff) but I&#39;m <br/>
hoping she can by next summer. So I&#39;m really looking at just trying <br/>
to survive the next maybe 6 months of part-time schooling. I HATE it, <br/>
but know no other way this minute. I want to make her unschooling <br/>
time, 4 days a week right now, really worthwhile. Right now she would <br/>
choose to watch tv all day. Is this just an aspect of deschooling? <br/>
It&#39;s very hard for me not to ask her to turn it off..I used to be <br/>
VERY anti-tv, but am trying to change my ways! Any even general <br/>
advice to someone very new to unschooling? What do you wish you had <br/>
known/done in the beginning? Are there parents on this board who, <br/>
like me, transitioned from schooling to unschooling or did everyone <br/>
start when their kids were young? I should mention that the concept <br/>
of unschooling has really got my daughter scratching her head..lol! <br/>
In Russia it was mandatory school 6 days per week and corporal <br/>
punishment was the norm. Right now she is still shocked that her <br/>
teachers here don&#39;t beat her....REALLY. The first day there she asked <br/>
me why the teacher smiled at her! Anyway, hope to learn alot here and <br/>
am glad for this space while I try to learn the basics...thanks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-535579753">Hi Keri,<br/>
Welcome !!<br/>
<br/>
I by no means am an expert in unschooling, but I&#39;m so happy to have found <br/>
this path. We did start with the whole school at home idea. Did it for a <br/>
couple of years, right down to a time schedule. Yuck !!!  We went to <br/>
eclectic learning, did math & spelling by the book but all the rest the kids <br/>
picked.  After reading here, a few other groups (which we learned there was <br/>
some better than others), and many web sites it dawned on me unschooling is <br/>
what we were looking for & needed so badly.  I came to realize the tears <br/>
(mine & theirs) were NOT necessary. That there was a better way. Do we wish <br/>
we had followed the unschooling way of life in the beginning?  You bet, we <br/>
were slow getting here but we did it.<br/>
It took me a while to start to &quot;get it&quot;,  lots of day of wondering if this <br/>
was the right thing to do.  We did it slowly, I started by saying yes alot <br/>
more ( and if it was no, we made very sure of the reason, explaining it to <br/>
the kids & letting the kids have their say). I went thru our school stuff & <br/>
made a pile of &quot;school&quot; stuff. Kept all the books that weren&#39;t text books & <br/>
are putting the rest on ebay.  Well, we did keep the Math U See because my <br/>
dd loves to play with the pages & blocks but when she&#39;s ready to let go of <br/>
it its gone also.  That was one step on our journey but it won&#39;t be the last <br/>
:)<br/>
From one newbie to another .... welcome & hang in there.<br/>

<br/>
Yes.<br/>
It&#39;s called de-schooling, and if you don&#39;t trust it, you might slow <br/>
down her healing. Instead of stressing about it, look at it as an <br/>
opportunity to connect. Watch some of her shows, find out what she <br/>
loves about them, find a common ground to connect on.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;Any even general<br/>
advice to someone very new to unschooling?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The same I give to everyone....make this summer vacation. I realize <br/>
you&#39;ve got to get through her being in school for a while, but you can <br/>
start making life at home really FUN. Pretend like schools out for the <br/>
summer (only it will be much longer than that very soon) and bring the <br/>
things you both love into your lives. Movies, drives to interesting <br/>
places (just for fun, not to be &quot;educational&quot;), playing games, taking <br/>
walks, trying new foods etc....are all ways to get in the flow <br/>
now...it will seem second nature by the time she&#39;s home.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What do you wish you had<br/>
known/done in the beginning?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I wish I had REALLY trusted my kids. Trusted that whatever caught <br/>
their attention, whatever they enjoyed was truly important for them. I <br/>
wish I had simply tried to really get into their world, understand why <br/>
it fascinated them rather than layer my judgements onto things (like <br/>
tv or video games), I wish I had truly been their companion and not <br/>
harmed their trust in ME.<br/>
