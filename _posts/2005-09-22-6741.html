<div id="ygrps-yiv-626015499">Hi Everyone!<br/>
   My family is brand new to homeschooling and I have found myself <br/>
drawn to unscholling because it feels like what my dh and I have been <br/>
doing with our ds-aged 6-since he was born.  I will admit that I am <br/>
unsure of unscholling.  One of the reasons I wanted to homeschool was <br/>
because I wanted ds to have the education I felt that I did&#39;nt have. I <br/>
have begun to realize that is an issue for me to deal with and not one <br/>
to lay on my child.<br/>
   My ds is interested and curious about so many things. And I don&#39;t <br/>
want anything to quash his enthusiasm-biggest reason we decided to <br/>
homeschool!  I guess my first question is where to start my learning <br/>
process about unscholling.  At first I toyed with classical <br/>
homeschooling but that is just soooo ridgid and my ds began to chafe <br/>
under the structure of having to learn a particular thing at a <br/>
particular time.  I&#39;m a reader so If anyone could suggest where to <br/>
start and what to read I would be grateful<br/>
   My very breif foray into this group has been very very helpful.  I <br/>
know there will a zillion qustions that I will have and I look forward <br/>
to meeting all of you along the journey.</div>
