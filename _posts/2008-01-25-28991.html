<div id="ygrps-yiv-2041274398">I just saw this post, and I thought I would respond. Someone else may have<br/>
already, but I haven&#39;t gotten through the other posts yet, because we did<br/>
just get back from the Waterpark gathering! <br/>

Anyway, you do not have to do testing at the end of the year. You can just<br/>
have a certified teacher sign off saying your child is doing fine. There are<br/>
many of these unschooling friendly people that will help you with this.<br/>
Sometimes you can make an agreement with the superintendent in your area to<br/>
do your own assessment, just depends on the district.<br/>

&quot;What would it be like if you lived each day, each breath, as a work of art<br/>
in progress? Imagine that you are a masterpiece unfolding, every second of<br/>
every day, a work of art taking form with every breath.&quot;<br/>
