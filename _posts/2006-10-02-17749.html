<div id="ygrps-yiv-13927668">Hi, GracieAnn,<br/>
<br/>
Time is a funny thing.  It&#39;s a human invention, and in the wonderful <br/>
world of childhood, it&#39;s all but irrelevant.  Because unschooling is <br/>
totally about trust, can you develop trust that your daughter will <br/>
learn about time from living through time?  For my now-11-year-old <br/>
son, the concept of time was not relevant until he wanted to know <br/>
what time it was so he wouldn&#39;t miss a particular TV show he was <br/>
interested in or if there was someplace we had to be that he was very <br/>
interested in.  But, as a younger kid, (maybe 7 or 8 and younger) he <br/>
came up with a great term (which he doesn&#39;t use anymore :-( <br/>
):  &quot;Nexterday.&quot;  He had absolutely *no* concept of time, and it <br/>
didn&#39;t bother him (or me) at all!  What did he need time for <br/>
anyway?!  I knew that when it became important in his life, that <br/>
would be the time when he would gain the understanding of it.  And he <br/>
has!  Here&#39;s a great example:<br/>
<br/>
I use a 24-hour clock on my computer because of the work I do.  One <br/>
day when he was about 10 years old he said to me:  &quot;Oh!  I get <br/>
it!  If you subtract 12 from that number, you&#39;ll get what the time <br/>
is!&quot;  My computer clock at the time said it was 20:15.  He figured <br/>
out that it was actually 8:15 p.m.  I had never even explained it to <br/>
him!!!  He just puzzled it out (for who knows how long!) and came to <br/>
that understanding entirely on his own!  Perhaps, if I had labored to <br/>
explain it to him, he still might not grasp it (it certainly took me <br/>
a lot longer than that to understand the 24-hour clock!).<br/>
<br/>
Reading an analog clock can be very tricky for kids, but I remember <br/>
when he puzzled that out, too!  We had gotten him a big wall clock <br/>
without a battery in it and didn&#39;t mount it on the wall so he could <br/>
play with it.  Or not.  Totally up to him.  But, he did play with it <br/>
&#39;cause *he* wanted to, and he eventually figured out what it all <br/>
meant.  It&#39;s his preference to use a digital clock, but his <br/>
understanding of the way an analog clock works (which is a graphic <br/>
demonstration of how time moves) is his own.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re willing to embrace unschooling, try to let go of the idea <br/>
that you have to &quot;teach&quot; her anything about time!  Time is swirling <br/>
around her always, and she&#39;ll grasp it when *she* needs to ~~ and/or <br/>
she&#39;ll ask for your help.  Give her your help freely and watch what happens!!<br/>
<br/>
I hope that helps!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1425756427">Eh...much to my husbands chagrin....I never use the clock. I don&#39;t  <br/>
even use it when I cook. I will say that seven is young for telling  <br/>
time beyond hour and half hour. Most cooks I know don&#39;t use clocks  <br/>
per se, but timers (which I don&#39;t use either, I&#39;m rather the kind to  <br/>
pull it out when it looks done or smells too good to wait any longer)<br/>
<br/>
With my kids, I think they&#39;ve just picked it up over time when I&#39;ve  <br/>
said, we&#39;ll need to leave at 6:30 to get there on time, and then they  <br/>
watch the clock. Or if a friend is coming over they ask over and over  <br/>
&quot;What time is it?&quot; At that point it&#39;s important to them to know time.  <br/>
Rachel just asked for a new watch. She can&#39;t tell time, but it was  <br/>
important to her. My mom told me when I was about her age, I could  <br/>
have one AFTER I learned to tell time. All that did was break my  <br/>
heart. And make me feel bad.<br/>
<br/>
Just keep using time in your life. She&#39;ll pick it up soon enough.<br/>

:)  Get her a watch that is digital as well.  I don&#39;t worry about<br/>
clocks.  They are fairly easy to figure out once you understand the<br/>

Thank you yes she is very interested because of cooking and baking she wants to do it on her own with out a timer like<br/>
 &quot; mommy does&quot;  so I was trying to help her add 30 minutes to the time it is easier when the time is on the hour because that is easier for her but she is a very independant child and wants to know everything she has always asked questions with me and we are very up front with her <br/>

   ***How about a play analog clock next to a real one.  First turn the hands to match the working one.  Next set it ahead the number of minutes you need.  First with your help, soon without.  Wait for the real clock to match the fake one.<br/>

  Thank you yes she is very interested because of cooking and baking she wants to do it on her own with out a timer like<br/>
  &quot; mommy does&quot; so I was trying to help her add 30 minutes to the time it is easier when the time is on the hour because that is easier for her but she is a very independant child and wants to know everything she has always asked questions with me and we are very up front with her. <br/>

  ***How about a play analog clock next to a real one. First turn the hands to match the working one. Next set it ahead the number of minutes you need. First with your help, soon without. Wait for the real clock to match the fake one.<br/>
