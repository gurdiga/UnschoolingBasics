<div id="ygrps-yiv-489492260">Hi everyone!<br/>
I just joined the group.  We are in CO, and have one 2 1/2 year old little guy that we <br/>
have started thinking about schooling for.  The more I read about HSing, and <br/>
specifically unschooling, the more excited I get about the journey that awaits us!  I&#39;ve <br/>
been devouring all of the books I can, and spending lots of time on the web.  I&#39;m <br/>
happy to have found this group, and look forward to learning lots from all of you.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to connect with some local unschoolers, so if you are in or around the <br/>
Boulder/Denver area, please let me know!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
Michelle</div>
