<div id="ygrps-yiv-1388660863">I&#39;ve just joined this group today and I&#39;m very excited<br/>
about being here.<br/>
<br/>
My name is Nzinga and I&#39;m a 34 y/o single mom of<br/>
Maryam who&#39;s 2.9.  We are currently Preunschooling and<br/>
live in Texas.  Our pics are in my profile.<br/>
<br/>
I believe I will flow well within this group.  I have<br/>
read a few (of the multitudes) of archived posts and<br/>
while I can&#39;t read them all, I did get a feel for the<br/>
energy and flow of this group.<br/>
<br/>
I practice AP and try to live as natural a lifelstyle<br/>
as possible and unschooling fits within the scheme of<br/>
our lives.  Maryam was breastfed until just after her<br/>
second birthday, we co-sleep, practice yoga and<br/>
meditation and love unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I am a former Elementary educator and now I work part<br/>
time, of all places, at the local public library.  I<br/>
try to feed her interests of which at the time is<br/>
tornadoes.  We checked out & read books on tornadoes,<br/>
she draws tornadoes on her sketch board, we&#39;ve<br/>
downloaded real tornadoes online, made up a tornado<br/>
dance, colors tornadoes in her weather booklet and she<br/>
watches one of her favorite movies, Muppets&#39; Wizard of<br/>
Oz, at least once a week.<br/>
<br/>
We unschool usually through teachable moments and my<br/>
feeding her interests but I am here to learn more of<br/>
what I can do especially as she gets older. Also, as a<br/>
former educator, I&#39;m resisting the urge to print out<br/>
worksheets.  I&#39;m working on &quot;deschooling&quot; myself. I&#39;m<br/>
looking forward to learning and sharing with you all.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Peace! <br/>

The &quot;blank&quot; is changing here in Cape Cod, MA.  My neighbor who is in <br/>
Kindergarten has an hour of homework each night.  At the preschool, which we have as <br/>
part of the public school, 4 year olds are &quot;required&quot; to write their names and <br/>
know the alphabet, not just the song, before moving to K.  This makes the rest <br/>
of the kindergartners, whose moms let them stay home and play at 4, start off <br/>
their public school education &quot;behind&quot; the ones who went to preschool thus <br/>
perpetuating the problem.  One of my brilliant little Girl Scouts stayed back in <br/>
Kindergarten.  She is considered a &quot;behavior problem&quot; at age 6 because she <br/>
doesn&#39;t follow the masses and she often says no when asked to do something.  <br/>
These kids are taught very young that they have NO choices.  What ever happened <br/>
to coloring, playing, building with blocks?  <br/>
<br/>
The second and third graders sometimes have 2 hours of homework each night.  <br/>
My daughter&#39;s friend is not allowed outside until hers is finished so we <br/>
haven&#39;t seen her much since school started because it gets dark before she can <br/>
finish her schoolwork.  She has a full time job at age 7 and isn&#39;t getting paid in <br/>
any form, even knowledge, because she hates learning so much.<br/>
<br/>
Done ranting, sorry this ended up so long.<br/>

<br/>
Aaaah....I love the picture of you nursing at the computer with a<br/>
little one massaging your feet!:)  Sounds like scenes of my recent<br/>
past. sigh.<br/>
<br/>
Breaks my heart about what is being done to children in the name of<br/>
&quot;learning&quot; too.  I just have a very hard time understanding how anyone<br/>
thinks that anguish and frustration lead to very productive learning<br/>
for a young child. Yuck.<br/>
<br/>
I had a lovely conversation with a co-worker in the break room<br/>
yesterday. She&#39;s in her 60&#39;s, a former school teacher. She kept asking<br/>
questions about the way we homeschool, and I explained as best I could<br/>
in a short time.<br/>
She thought it was SO cool! &quot;So they get to learn the things they&#39;re<br/>
really good at and interested in? That&#39;s so amazing!&quot; She wanted to<br/>
read about it and decided to tell her son about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently, the son takes his 4y.o. to work with him and buys him his<br/>
very own REAL tools (he&#39;s a contractor). This little guy says &quot;my<br/>
Daddy needs me today!&quot; and traipses off to work with him.<br/>
How cool! She wanted to let them know about unschooling because she<br/>
thought it sounded like the way they were being raised already.:)<br/>
<br/>
Ya just never know.....<br/>

One can only hope that societal pressure doesn&#39;t force this Dad to surrender <br/>
his son to to strangers next year and that he flows with the continnuum.  <br/>
Hopefully your friend can increase the kid&#39;s chance of survival by educating the <br/>
parents.<br/>
