<div id="ygrps-yiv-119184281">Hi there<br/>
<br/>
I know this sounds like the standard question, but what do you do <br/>
with your younger ones ? Sylvain, my older, is 7 and his sisters are <br/>
5 and 2 and I have some difficulties planning activities with the 3 <br/>
of them. For instance, there is a nice museum near us, called <br/>
Alimentarium, but it is meant for 6 years old and older - when I plan <br/>
to go there, I&#39;m a bit anxious : how will I do to follow the expo <br/>
path with Sylvain and watching the little ones who might be more <br/>
interested in running around ...<br/>
<br/>
When I read about your days, you all seem pretty occupied, and your <br/>
kids go here and there, doing sport and music and all sort of things. <br/>
Mine don&#39;t. We are together most of the time (my son plays soccer <br/>
once a week). As I am the kind of person who likes to be home and who <br/>
could spend her whole time reading, I&#39;m a bit worried that we&#39;re not <br/>
doing *enough* interesting things.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas, suggestions for young kids ?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2092603293">Sorry, pressed send before writing. I have two young<br/>
ones, 6 and just turned 3 and we would often go to<br/>
places that were not for their age. We were for<br/>
example just in Italy with my parents and going to<br/>
&#39;adult&#39; museums. Their reaction to things my vary, but<br/>
they might surprise you. Yesterday I took them to a<br/>
3-D bug show and for a change my 3 y.o. liked it best,<br/>
sitting absolutely still and focused, usuallly it is<br/>
the other way around. Sometimes you might have to go<br/>
faster through or one might like to linger more in one<br/>
area than the other, but then I just say, J. wants to<br/>
stay in this room for a while, then we will go over<br/>
there etc. For the younger ones it might help to talk<br/>
about it before, like,  do you want to go to a museum<br/>
that&#39;s all about food? And mention some of the fun<br/>
stuff that might be there, like cooking demonstrations<br/>
etc.&#39;. <br/>
Sometimes you might have to do more snack and drink<br/>
breaks or go to a room they can run around more - if<br/>
that is not possible, run around outside the museum<br/>
first so they might  be more focused when they get<br/>
inside.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is kind of funny to me bc my younger child is more interested <br/>
in museums than the older. I periodically take her to museums and <br/>
galleries when Ray is otherwise occupied (at a friend&#39;s house or <br/>
visiting his mom for example). She loves them, but she&#39;s also very <br/>
very active, so going to a museum is kind of like having a high-<br/>
speed chase through the halls and chatting about what she liked best <br/>
over ice-cream later. I don&#39;t know how she manages to see anything <br/>
at that speed, but she does. I also plan to spend some time in the <br/>
gift shop, and go with a very clear budget for that, so I don&#39;t get <br/>
sucked into alllllllll the neat stuff....ahem.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, where I&#39;m going with this is that its often possible to take <br/>
younger kids to places &quot;designed&quot; for older kids and even adults as <br/>
long as you don&#39;t have any particular expectation that your younger <br/>
kids are going to behave like good little tourists. I&#39;d avoid places <br/>
where there are a lot of appealing things for little ones to have to <br/>
not-touch, but especially going to a museum in the middle of the <br/>
day, during the week, there&#39;s usually lots of space and few people <br/>
to knock over or otherwise irritate. <br/>
<br/>
Its also possible to take older kids to places designed for little <br/>
ones if they&#39;re amenable. I&#39;ve found that if *I* get down and start <br/>
playing (or whatever) my older kid will losen up a little on the <br/>
whole &quot;I&#39;m way to old for this&quot; thing and start to play, too.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m posting a link to one of my favorite idea lists for other things <br/>
to do with kids, if you need some help thinking &quot;out of the box&quot;:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-964618712">We spent a lot of time in parks and at the McDonalds Play Place when  <br/>
my kids were young.  If my oldest wanted to play with me, that was a  <br/>
good time to pull out some little thing that was hard to do at home  <br/>
with the little ones. A set of tangrams, a deck of cards, some dice,  <br/>
some easy little game. Crayons and paper. A camera. Books I could  <br/>
read aloud to her.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d go easy on the museums - there are plenty of interesting places  <br/>
to go with little kids for quicker, easier visits. Even just the  <br/>
grocery store can be awesome - try to find something new every time  <br/>
you go - a new kind of fruit or veggie to take home and cut open.  <br/>
Maybe dip the veggie or fruit pieces in some paint and use them as  <br/>
stamps.<br/>
<br/>
Stop for a few minutes to watch at construction sites. I loved the  <br/>
book, &quot;Mike Mulligan&#39;s Steam Shovel&quot; when I was a kid and so I shared  <br/>
it with my kids. I just got curious about how old that book is and  <br/>
looked it up - it was written in 1939, which means it was probably  <br/>
one of my mom&#39;s favorite books, too, which is why she shared it with  <br/>
me. There are some activities on the website for it, here: &lt;http:// <br/>
www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/features/mike_mulligan/activities.shtml&gt;  <br/>
AND the same author write another of my all-time favorite books, one  <br/>
I read over and over and over to my own kids, &quot;The Little House.&quot; I  <br/>
got a lot of ideas from these kinds of published activities - not  <br/>
that I used them as lessons, they were just &quot;ideas,&quot; that I might  <br/>
toss out there if the kids seemed open to me suggesting something to do.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - one of the things &quot;I&quot; liked to do was think about great  <br/>
kids&#39; books that related to the everyday things we were experiencing.  <br/>
One day we were scrounging for change and I remembered there was a  <br/>
book about a family of pigs that scrounged for change all over the  <br/>
house. &quot;Pigs Will be Pigs&quot; is the name of the book. These days, you  <br/>
have Google to help you find such connections.<br/>
<br/>
We went to a LOT of children&#39;s shows - musical theater, puppets, etc.  <br/>
We went to events intended for young children at the library. The  <br/>
older kids get a lot out of these.<br/>
<br/>
We also spent a lot of time in libraries with children&#39;s sections,  <br/>
movies, stores like IKEA with children&#39;s play areas and cafeterias.  <br/>
The malls often have exhibits - car show, orchids, paintings,  <br/>
jewelry, photography, and so on. We&#39;d sort of wander through those  <br/>
sometimes. Also, we DID go to museums and exhibits and things like  <br/>
that, with the little ones in tow. You don&#39;t have to make a day of it  <br/>
- we often went places for an hour or less, just enough to enjoy a  <br/>
few things and then we&#39;d go to a park or somewhere else to play. The  <br/>
trick with taking three young children places is to make it short and  <br/>
sweet and be willing to leave soon after arriving. That&#39;s why it is  <br/>
better not to make a big investment of money or travel time.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My kids are 10, 7, and 2, so I also have the age issue to deal with.  <br/>
I have found that memberships have helped me deal with this issue.  I <br/>
joined the zoo and a couple of other local museums.  After paying the <br/>
membership fee, we get free admission.  I don&#39;t have to deal with the <br/>
stress of feeling like I wasted the money if we have to leave shortly <br/>
after we arrived.<br/>
<br/>
I am often pleasantly suprised when I give my kids a chance to attend <br/>
something intended for a different age group.  My 10 year old wanted <br/>
to attend a class at the zoo for 8-12 year olds, so of course we <br/>
towed everyone along.  All three kids enjoyed the class, and they all <br/>
participated in a way that was appropriate for their developmental <br/>
levels.  Usually the trick is just to make sure everyone is well fed <br/>
and well rested.<br/>
