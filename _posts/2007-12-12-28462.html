<div id="ygrps-yiv-1522037759">This is bringing up bad memories of Dad trying to censor my media. <br/>
Alan is clearly trying to censor things that don&#39;t fit with his<br/>
personal world view and cognitive processes.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I want her to read only the top books ...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Awful.  Instead, he should read her what she likes and try to talk<br/>
about it with her.  What if being true to herself means exactly the<br/>
opposite of seeing life as &quot;a mystical adventure&quot;?  Ironically, he<br/>
needs a more open mind.  He could go to any modern, mainstream list of<br/>
children&#39;s books and find loads of stuff that&#39;s specifically designed<br/>
to stimulate children&#39;s minds in various ways.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not wrong to search for books that &quot;speak to elevated spiritual<br/>
principles,&quot; but to cut out all other things will stunt the kid&#39;s<br/>
ability to decide for herself what &quot;speaks to&quot; her.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for breaking free of this crap and buying me that first<br/>
computer.  Feel free to forward this to Alan, even if you have to warn<br/>
him that I&#39;m an asshole first.  His daughter might be an asshole too.<br/>
<br/>
Another way to put it: What if he had said he only wanted to read her<br/>
books in line with the highest Christian principles?<br/>

<br/>
Have him bring his daughter to the library.<br/>
Show her the kids&#39; section.<br/>
Have her pick out ten books.<br/>
Yes, I know she&#39;s only 1.<br/>
<br/>
There is more Buddha-nature in the eyes of a child than there are in 10,000<br/>
books about the Buddha-nature.<br/>

I thought that was worth repeating....maybe even 10,000 times. Very true.<br/>
