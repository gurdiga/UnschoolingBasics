<div id="ygrps-yiv-233398970">Hello!  First let me introduce myself.  I have been lurking for a  <br/>
while and enjoy the discussions.  I am a mom with 3 yo twins living  <br/>
away from family with my partner.  I am very interested in  <br/>
unschooling and thought my kids were &quot;too young&quot; to start thinking  <br/>
about &quot;education&quot;.  The more I read, the better I understand that the  <br/>
learning is happening here and now.  One of the ideas I am most  <br/>
attracted to is allowing children to create their own path.<br/>
<br/>
That brings me to my question.  I never went for letting my kids cry- <br/>
it-out to get to sleep.  Because of sleep deprivation and lack of  <br/>
extra help, I am in the position where my kids won&#39;t sleep unless one  <br/>
of us is in the room laying down with them.  Some times this is fine  <br/>
but more often it feels like a burden these days.  I truly want my  <br/>
kids to learn how to sleep on their own without trauma.  Today after  <br/>
reading a post I realized forcing them into my idea of their sleep  <br/>
schedule was creating discomfort for all of us.  I want to let them  <br/>
develop their own routine around sleep and learn to ask to go to  <br/>
sleep when they are ready.<br/>
<br/>
It would be great if anyone who has been in this position could offer  <br/>
some advice.  My partner is not too keen on the idea.  Feeling it  <br/>
would be too loosy-goosey and permissive (we definitely fall on  <br/>
different parts of the spectrum around their role in decision  <br/>
making).  We need to be on the same page about this as we both  <br/>
participate in the night time routine.  I would love to have some  <br/>
anecdotal evidence to share to bring us closer together on this issue.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for all your support<br/>
Theresa<br/>
