<div id="ygrps-yiv-1206387922">Does anyone here ever feel like quitting and just putting their kids <br/>
back in school?  We are fairly new to unschooling.  We pulled dd who <br/>
was in gr3 and ds who was in kindergarten out of public school this <br/>
October.  Mostly because dd had very low self esteem because of <br/>
issues at school.  Things were going great until early December and <br/>
we had to spend 5 weeks in another Provence (we are from Canada) due <br/>
to a family illness.  This put a lot of stress on the kids and myself <br/>
being at my Mom&#39;s house.  She says she is supportive of my decision <br/>
to unschool but she still thinks spanking is necessary to make my <br/>
kids listen and be good.  So needless to say there was a bit of <br/>
negative feelings during that time on top of my Dad having a major <br/>
stoke.<br/>
<br/>
I assumed that when we got back home everything would go back to <br/>
normal any we would be happy again.  Well not the case!  My son is <br/>
acting out verbally and physically alot!!!  Hurting his sister, the <br/>
animals, our stuff and myself.  He is a bit more controlled with my <br/>
husband but not completely.  Everyone is miserable.  I am trying my <br/>
best to be a good Mom.  I know he is going through something <br/>
emotionally mostly having to do with Grandpa being so ill and not <br/>
responding to him due to the stroke.  I have been trying to give him <br/>
more quality attention, always saying &#39;yes&#39;, being more <br/>
respectful,etc.  I am trying to follow the Sandra Dodd website but it <br/>
does not seem to be working. He is increasingly mean.  (I have no <br/>
idea what to do) I am finding that we cannot even go out anywhere <br/>
because we never know when he is going to &quot;blow&quot;.  This is not fair <br/>
to my dd who is most happy out and about.  I feel pulled apart in two <br/>
directions and nobody is getting what they want or need.  We run a <br/>
home based heating and air conditioning business so my husband works <br/>
ALOT.  Like 12-14 hour days and when he gets home he is physically <br/>
and mentally exhausted and in no mood to deal with the kids.  I feel <br/>
so alone with no support.  I have no one to talk to because everybody <br/>
I know has their kids in school and they don&#39;t understand.  They all <br/>
think I am crazy and if I let them know that things are not great <br/>
then they just say put them back in school.  I have been to a few <br/>
unschooling group things but because ds never wants to go he is <br/>
miserable the whole time.  This makes it hard to make new friends - <br/>
for all of us.  <br/>
<br/>
I feel like I am having a nervous breakdown.  Maybe I just suck at <br/>
this and I am going to do more harm to my kids than school would.  <br/>
(But then I couldn&#39;t very well even just put them back in school <br/>
because we have not done any school work this year - they would be <br/>
way behind.)  Plus, I am scared my son is turning into a monster.  I <br/>
don&#39;t know how to help him stop being so angry.  My husband thinks my <br/>
problem is just winter blues as it is very cold here this past month.<br/>
<br/>
My question is does anyone ever feel like this?  And what should I be <br/>
saying to ds when he is hitting us or screaming at us.  I feel like <br/>
everyone is angry and miserable and it is all my fault.  <br/>
<br/>
Any feedback would be appreciated.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1527572949">Years ago, Mary Gold was struggling with so many things. She typed this <br/>
out and stuck it on her bathroom mirror:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s NOT the unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Meaning that it&#39;s other stuff that&#39;s causing the problems. <br/>
Unschooling&#39;s not causing the husband to work 12-14 hours/day. It <br/>
didn&#39;t cause the grandad to have a stroke or the grandmom to spank or <br/>
the child to have control issues or the friends to be unsupportive. You <br/>
could *blame* it on unschooling, but it would be better to address each <br/>
issue on its own.<br/>

Where are you Sue? Maybe we know someone nearby.<br/>
<br/>
Food allergies seem to be at the top of the list with &quot;explosive&quot; kids. <br/>
And have you read the book, The Explosive Child? You might want to try <br/>
changing his diet. What DOES he like to do? Can he do more of that? Is <br/>
there an indoor pool in town? Water is a good remedy for so many things.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s not a monster! &lt;g&gt; Keep in mind that he&#39;s only five---you&#39;re so <br/>
much older with so much more experience and *YOU* are having trouble <br/>
with all that&#39;s going on! Imagine how it is for *him* with only five <br/>
years on the planet!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe some folks wih more experience with these things will respond. <br/>

It&#39;ll get better! Age helps a lot. Tell us more.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-949711966">Thanks for responding Kelly - I was worried no one would respond and <br/>
I really do need help.  I truly believe that unschooling is a great <br/>
way to live and I want it to work for us.  I am just having a bit of <br/>
trouble knowing what I should be doing when certain things happen.<br/>
<br/>
I know it is not unschooling that is causing all these things.  These <br/>
things are just life.  (work hours, grandparents etc...) I am in <br/>
Hamilton , Ontario.  We are thinking about going to the Toronto <br/>
Unschooling Conference.  Does anyone know if it is a kid friendly <br/>
conference?<br/>
<br/>
My main question is how should I be responding to ds when he gets so <br/>
angry?  Do I put him in a time out?  (from what I think I know about <br/>
unschooling this does not encourage respect but maybe I am <br/>
interpreting it wrong)  Do I ignore it?  Do I speak firmly and tell <br/>
him not to do it?  Tell him that it hurts me or whatever?  None of <br/>
these seem to work.  (I do realize that it takes consistency and <br/>
time - but which thing do I say?) How do I respectfully get through <br/>
to him that he cannot do these things?  I know that he is acting this <br/>
way for a reason  - our parenting skills probably - which we are <br/>
really trying to change.  We are new at unschooling.  (Has anyone <br/>
ever seen it work? - a total shift to unschooling life from <br/>
authoritarian parenting?) While we are working on trying to respect <br/>
each other ds is only 5 and he is not understanding the respecting <br/>
part - there are still ALOT of blow ups.  I have that book on hold <br/>
from the library but I am #8 in line for it.  Maybe I will just go <br/>
and buy it.  I do find that some foods that have a lot of food <br/>
coloring in it seem to affect him badly. But not always.  <br/>
<br/>
We do go swimming a lot but gets he angry there usually at dd.  So <br/>
lately we have not gone very much.  I know I shouldn&#39;t care what <br/>
others think but really I do not like him acting like that in public <br/>
especially.  (I have been told by complete strangers that he needs to <br/>
be in school with more discipline!) <br/>
<br/>
I know a lot of this seems to be about me and my problems with what <br/>
is going on.  But I just don&#39;t know how to deal with this in an <br/>
unschooling way of life.  I totally get the no school part.  But we <br/>
want to embrace the respectful living part as well.  Dh is having a <br/>
bit of trouble with demanding that they do what is asked when asked <br/>
with no back talk.  I am trying to get him to see differently on <br/>
this.  But by the end of the day - especially if ds has been angry a <br/>
lot - I just want to go and cry and dh sometimes snaps and yells .. I <br/>
need help and direction from others who have experience with this.  <br/>
Since I cannot confide in many people I am hoping I will find <br/>
guidance here.<br/>
<br/>
Also, just recently we were at a thing with other homeschoolers and a <br/>
little girl was there probably about 6 or 7yrs old.  She was sooooo <br/>
mean and aggressive to all the other kids - strangers.  The mother <br/>
would just say don&#39;t talk like that - you need to be nice - always in <br/>
a normal voice.  The girl had a nastily look on her face and was <br/>
obviously ignoring her mom.  In one instance another mother had to <br/>
step up and &quot;protect&quot; her child from this kid because her own mom was <br/>
doing nothing.  Now my ds has not done this yet to strangers but he <br/>
does it to us.  And it was a real eyeopener that he could be on the <br/>
same path.  How do I get off that path to peaceful, respectful, <br/>
happy, joyful life????<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

at the hotel looks amazing! It even has a waterslide!<br/>

I think this may be a wonderful way to recharge your batteries, learn <br/>
more about unschooling and invigorate the energy in your family. There&#39;s <br/>
nothing quite like the positive, respectful parenting energy of an <br/>
unschooling conference.<br/>

also posted a couple of links to my webpage where I talk about parenting <br/>
an intense child. You might find those helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Keeping everyone in the home safe is an important part of a parent&#39;s <br/>
job, imo, but that also means doing so in a way that&#39;s not modeling <br/>
bullying and aggression and power right back. That&#39;s the trick and the <br/>
difference between conventional parenting advice and what you&#39;ll likely <br/>
find on the unschooling lists.<br/>

 We are thinking about going to the Toronto<br/>
Unschooling Conference.  Does anyone know if it is a kid friendly<br/>
conference?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
VERY! It was modeled after the Live and Learn Conference, so it&#39;s <br/>
family- and child-friendly. I heard lots of good feedback from the last <br/>
conference---and Pam has a great line-up of speakers this year. You <br/>
WON&#39;T be disappointed! GO!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
My main question is how should I be responding to ds when he gets so<br/>

<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Each child is different. Some need space to calm down. Some need a <br/>
tight squeese/hug to feel connected. Some like long discussions. Some <br/>
don&#39;t want to hear ONE word come out of your mouth. Some like to talk <br/>
things through. Some need pure quiet and reflective time. Some do well <br/>
with redirection.<br/>
<br/>
What works *best*?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
 How do I respectfully get through<br/>
to him that he cannot do these things?  I know that he is acting this<br/>
way for a reason  - our parenting skills probably - which we are<br/>
really trying to change.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Consistency helps.<br/>
<br/>
-=-==-=-<br/>
<br/>
  We are new at unschooling.  (Has anyone<br/>
ever seen it work? - a total shift to unschooling life from<br/>
authoritarian parenting?)<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yep. I was never authoritarian---but according to a poster a week or so <br/>
ago, I could have been described as authoritative. &lt;g&gt; Ben was <br/>
authoritarian. Cam&#39;s answer always had to be &quot;how high?&quot; Ben&#39;s <br/>
military---Citadel grad and Lt Colonel---Air Force and now Air National <br/>
Guard. &lt;G&gt; I didn&#39;t have too much to change, but Ben DID. Now Ben&#39;s <br/>
made this HUGE shift---having to come way farther than I did to begin <br/>
with, and now surpassing me with gentle parenting at times! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So, YES, it IS possible! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 While we are working on trying to respect<br/>
each other ds is only 5 and he is not understanding the respecting<br/>
part - there are still ALOT of blow ups.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
And understandably---right? You have to be respected---for a long <br/>
time---to be respectful.<br/>

Half.com, e-bay, amazon. I&#39;ve often paid more for the hshipping than <br/>
the book itself!<br/>

<br/>
 I do find that some foods that have a lot of food<br/>
coloring in it seem to affect him badly. But not always.<br/>

<br/>
Have you read Rue Kream&#39;s Parenting a Free Child? It&#39;s a play-by-play <br/>
about respecting children in an easy-to-read Q&A format. It will change <br/>
your life.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Also, just recently we were at a thing with other homeschoolers and a<br/>
little girl was there probably about 6 or 7yrs old.  She was sooooo<br/>

doing nothing.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
You realize that this is NOT what we are talking about, right? I would <br/>
have taken mine away or sat right there *between* my child and others <br/>
or found something else to do. Doing *nothing* is neglect, and that&#39;s <br/>
NOT what we promote here.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Now my ds has not done this yet to strangers but he does it to us.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
On the *up* side, that may be because he feels safe with you. He knows <br/>
he can be difficult, yet you&#39;ll still love and cherish him. THAT&#39;s a <br/>
good thing! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Many kids are angels at school. But come home and are absolute horrors <br/>
with mom. They&#39;ve struggled all day to be the perfect child, and <br/>
finally need a place to release all that anger and frustration they&#39;ve <br/>
been hiding all day. Mom&#39;s the safe outlet.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=--<br/>
<br/>
And it was a real eyeopener that he could be on the<br/>
same path.  How do I get off that path to peaceful, respectful,<br/>
happy, joyful life????<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
By seeing where he is now and understanding that he really doesn&#39;t want <br/>
to be this way either. He&#39;d like to have a smooth life too. He&#39;s just <br/>
really, really little with very few skills available to him. He&#39;s <br/>
honestly doing the best he can with the limited abilities he has.<br/>
<br/>
KNOW that, and you can start to help him cope.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-92453526">Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you&#39;re really having a tough time.<br/>
<br/>
The first thing I have to say is don&#39;t put him back in school for two reasons.<br/>
<br/>
The first is that the behavior will not likely &quot;change overnight&quot;...in<br/>
fact, putting him in school will likely make it worse.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, if he is struggling in this way, the school will likely take<br/>
it into their own hands and either throw him in a special ed progra or<br/>
start suspending him when he bothers his classmates.<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion is to firt, make an appointment with his pedeatrician<br/>
adn have a THoROUGH checkup done. Explain to him what&#39;s happening,<br/>
then ask that any physical causes be ruled out. My friend has a son<br/>
who would really act up and they found out that he had both hearing<br/>
AND vision problems. After you do a physical, if he is healthy and<br/>
still acting up, you might want to try having him seen by a child<br/>
psychiatrist.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, be patient and offer hiim consequences for his<br/>
actions (such as no tv, time out, etc..<br/>

<br/>
Does anyone here ever feel like quitting and just putting their kids<br/>
back in school?  We are fairly new to unschooling.  We pulled dd who<br/>
was in gr3 and ds who was in kindergarten out of public school this<br/>
October.  Mostly because dd had very low self esteem because of<br/>
issues at school.  Things were going great until early December and<br/>
we had to spend 5 weeks in another Provence (we are from Canada) due<br/>
to a family illness.  This put a lot of stress on the kids and myself<br/>
being at my Mom&#39;s house.  She says she is supportive of my decision<br/>
to unschool but she still thinks spanking is necessary to make my<br/>
kids listen and be good.  So needless to say there was a bit of<br/>
negative feelings during that time on top of my Dad having a major<br/>
stoke.<br/>
<br/>
I assumed that when we got back home everything would go back to<br/>
normal any we would be happy again.  Well not the case!  My son is<br/>
acting out verbally and physically alot!!!  Hurting his sister, the<br/>
animals, our stuff and myself.  He is a bit more controlled with my<br/>
husband but not completely.  Everyone is miserable.  I am trying my<br/>
best to be a good Mom.  I know he is going through something<br/>
emotionally mostly having to do with Grandpa being so ill and not<br/>
responding to him due to the stroke.  I have been trying to give him<br/>
more quality attention, always saying &#39;yes&#39;, being more<br/>
respectful,etc.  I am trying to follow the Sandra Dodd website but it<br/>
does not seem to be working. He is increasingly mean.  (I have no<br/>
idea what to do) I am finding that we cannot even go out anywhere<br/>
because we never know when he is going to &quot;blow&quot;.  This is not fair<br/>
to my dd who is most happy out and about.  I feel pulled apart in two<br/>
directions and nobody is getting what they want or need.  We run a<br/>
home based heating and air conditioning business so my husband works<br/>
ALOT.  Like 12-14 hour days and when he gets home he is physically<br/>
and mentally exhausted and in no mood to deal with the kids.  I feel<br/>
so alone with no support.  I have no one to talk to because everybody<br/>
I know has their kids in school and they don&#39;t understand.  They all<br/>
think I am crazy and if I let them know that things are not great<br/>
then they just say put them back in school.  I have been to a few<br/>
unschooling group things but because ds never wants to go he is<br/>
miserable the whole time.  This makes it hard to make new friends -<br/>
for all of us.<br/>
<br/>
I feel like I am having a nervous breakdown.  Maybe I just suck at<br/>
this and I am going to do more harm to my kids than school would.<br/>
(But then I couldn&#39;t very well even just put them back in school<br/>
because we have not done any school work this year - they would be<br/>
way behind.)  Plus, I am scared my son is turning into a monster.  I<br/>
don&#39;t know how to help him stop being so angry.  My husband thinks my<br/>
problem is just winter blues as it is very cold here this past month.<br/>
<br/>
My question is does anyone ever feel like this?  And what should I be<br/>
saying to ds when he is hitting us or screaming at us.  I feel like<br/>
everyone is angry and miserable and it is all my fault.<br/>
<br/>
Any feedback would be appreciated.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2099074545">Hi Sue,<br/>
<br/>
I can totally understand where you&#39;re coming from -- I&#39;ve triggered a similar discussion with a post about a conflict between my kids, one of whom (7yo) can be very aggressive and has horrible rages.  A couple months ago, when he had a really bad spell, I was saying a lot of the same things you did in your post, including thinking about sending him to school (to protect his sibling!).  As with your son, this behavior started kind of suddenly.   Actually, it started not long after my dad died suddenly (he collapsed hiking) and we&#39;d spent the month of December going back and forth to my mom&#39;s house.  The kids hadn&#39;t been particularly close to Daddy, but I was deeply grieving.<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest you go *buy* the book (I think you&#39;re refering to the Explosive Child).  Ask your husband to read it too.  It&#39;s not about unschooling, per se, at all, but the approach to the rages is compatible and he explains it really well.  <br/>
<br/>
I think the difference between that little girl at the playground and your child is that her mother wasn&#39;t doing *anything*.  If her child couldn&#39;t interact with the other children appropriately, her mother should have been right there at her side, guiding her and interacting with her -- not *after* the aggression but before (or rather, in place of).  Or maybe just not at the park at all, but instead having playdates at home with one other child.  It&#39;s one thing if it happens once and you talk about it, but if it&#39;s the child&#39;s regular mode of interaction then clearly they need active supervision and guidance.<br/>

My main question is how should I be responding to ds when he gets so <br/>
<br/>
angry? &lt;snip&gt;   I have that book on hold <br/>
<br/>
from the library but I am #8 in line for it.  Maybe I will just go <br/>
<br/>
and buy it.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, just recently we were at a thing with other homeschoolers and a <br/>
<br/>
little girl was there probably about 6 or 7yrs old.  She was sooooo <br/>
<br/>
mean and aggressive to all the other kids - strangers.  The mother <br/>
<br/>
would just say don&#39;t talk like that - you need to be nice - always in <br/>
<br/>
a normal voice.  The girl had a nastily look on her face and was <br/>
<br/>
obviously ignoring her mom.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1148716744">I think that there are two matters here. First is how to handle a<br/>
child who is having difficulty and the second one is TV&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In regards to children acting up. I don&#39;t believe in physical<br/>
punishments, sending a child &quot;to their room&quot; or time out in an area<br/>
away from the rest of the family. However, I feel that children need<br/>
to learn from a young age that their action has a consequence. IE. If<br/>
you throw something, you have to pick it up. If you hit your sister,<br/>
you don&#39;t get to play with her for a while.<br/>
<br/>
Children are needy by nature but it doesn&#39;t mean that they should be<br/>
allowed free reign to do what they want. If your daughter or son were<br/>
to start hitting you whenever the urge hits, would you allow it or<br/>
would you distract him from that behavior? I don&#39;t mean using<br/>
consequences as a form of punishment but rather, as a tool to show<br/>
them that for every cause, there is an action.<br/>
Takig away the TV or making them sit down is not having confort<br/>
removed, especially if mommy or daddy are right beside them giving<br/>
them hugs.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly is television. I&#39;m currently living in Saudi Arabia where<br/>
because of such nasty segregation, most women spend their free time<br/>
inside and either weatch TV or play video games. This country has been<br/>
reduced to a stupor because of it. Hobbies and passtimes are virtually<br/>
non-existent, with the exception of going to the shopping malls. I had<br/>
a student come into my class this year who is almost 5, yet had never<br/>
colored or looked through a book. He had never handled scissors nor<br/>
sociallized with ANYONE other than his younger brother. He is<br/>
encouraged by his mother to be abusive to the mai (but that&#39;s another<br/>
story)...and this is a member of the royal family! Thak God, he was<br/>
able to gain lots of skills in our class (it&#39;s a montessori school)<br/>
but this is only one example of the damage TV has done to ths society.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know a single young teenager here who hasn&#39;t memorized the<br/>
Buffy TV series, yet ask her what she does other than watch TV (or go<br/>
shopping) and she&#39;ll usually shrug. I was equally getting caught up in<br/>
TV until I deleted all teh Western TV channels from the satellite and<br/>
surprise, surprise, all of the sudden I have all of this free time.<br/>
<br/>
The worst behaviors that I developped as a teen were from watching<br/>
telavision. From running out of the room when annoyed to insulting and<br/>
being rude to my parents, I have the lovely american sitcoms to thank<br/>
for that.<br/>
<br/>
TV is not all bad, documentaries are wonderful learning tools and it&#39;s<br/>
nice to watch a movie now and then, or the news for that matter but on<br/>
the whole, my personal experience has shown that TV causes much mor<br/>
edamage than benifits. When I return to Canada in the summer, it&#39;s my<br/>
intention to completely forgo the TV.<br/>
<br/>
I need to find the sources, but I also remember reading studies that<br/>
TV can lower your metabolism and puts you into a form of trance. It<br/>
stunts all conversation in the room (most times).<br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents...<br/>

  It&#39;s not the TV, tho.  The stupor results from living a life so segregated that one can&#39;t pursue one&#39;s joy.  If women in Saudi Arabia are trapped in their homes, with nothing else but TV and video games to watch -- it&#39;s the fault of their imprisonment, not the TV they&#39;re offered for entertainment.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Blaming TV is like saying -- all that pretty bird in the cage does is look at itself in the mirror, so I&#39;ll get rid of the mirror, then he&#39;ll have to DO something.  Captives will look for comfort wherever it can be found -- that doesn&#39;t make the comfort source the cause of their unhappiness.  <br/>

So you&#39;re talking about parent-imposed consequences, right?<br/>
<br/>
&#39;Cause the *natural* consequence of throwing something in the floor is <br/>
that floor is littered.<br/>
The *natural* consequence of hitting your sister is that she may not <br/>
want to play with you for a while or even ever.<br/>

It helps to be smarter than the TV.<br/>

You mean you couldn&#39;t just turn it off and walk away? It holds that <br/>

Wow.<br/>

I have three tvs in this house. Amazingly, it doesn&#39;t hold that kind of <br/>
power over me. Why do you suppose that is?<br/>

The worst behaviors that I developped as a teen were from watching<br/>
telavision. From running out of the room when annoyed to insulting and<br/>
being rude to my parents, I have the lovely american sitcoms to thank<br/>
for that.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I didn&#39;t know TVs could make teens sullen and insulting and rude. Good <br/>
to know, I guess. My first teen was never like that. Maybe I just <br/>
lucked out. Maybe I should ban the TV starting today so that my almost <br/>
11 year old won&#39;t become rude and insulting. But no hints of that yet.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it could possibly have been crappy parenting? Heavy peer <br/>
pressure? School?<br/>

Sad. Just a simple change of perspective could make you see how <br/>

When we have guests or are playing games, we simpy TURN IT OFF to talk <br/>
without it in the background.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-251112542">I think you&#39;ll get a lot of feedback from this, but I wanted to point out two things. One is <br/>
that the situation you are undergoing in SA is no where similar to the typical. Saying that <br/>
watching television will create the same nature in all people, is flawed logic. In most <br/>
people&#39;s homes, they are not restricted in their daily lives. My kids have dozens of things <br/>
that they can choose from, and so unlimited television is just another tool to them. <br/>
<br/>
(I also wanted to say in the interest of fairness that not *all* SA women are like that, I <br/>
know of two families here in our small town for school, who despite the restrictions have <br/>
spent a majority of their time sewing, cooking from scratch, organizing items for <br/>
homeless and orphans. Perhaps it&#39;s the westernized people that would seek schooling, <br/>
who would choose to leave behind their culture to focus on television)<br/>
<br/>
The second thing I wanted to ask was that where do your children measure in in the say of <br/>
&#39;completely forgoing television&#39;? What if they ask for it? By limiting certain TV shows will <br/>
you be giving them more appeal? I would argue that no TV is bad, my  kids have learned <br/>
something from everything they watch. Maybe it has to do with the fact that I am right <br/>
there, and they can look to me for feedback on behaviors, morals, etc. As well, when they <br/>
experiment with a certain behavior, I can recognize it for what it is, know it for what it is, <br/>
and live in the moment without overreacting. <br/>

Kids don&#39;t hit other kids because they&#39;re mean. Kids hit because they  <br/>

acceptable. It&#39;s not merely a matter of information. Sometimes it&#39;s  <br/>
learning to identify subtle feelings before they get to the breaking  <br/>

Kids *do* need to hear &quot;No&quot; to hitting. But a simple firm no gets  <br/>
that principle into the home atmosphere. Then move onto finding a  <br/>

Even better is being aware of tiredness and irritation and diffusing  <br/>

<br/>
But rather than seeing children&#39;s actions as deliberate choices to be  <br/>
bad, it&#39;s more helpful, more relationship building to see the actions  <br/>
as a sign of needing help getting what they need. They don&#39;t have the  <br/>
knowledge or don&#39;t have the skills to use the knowledge, or don&#39;t  <br/>
have the maturity to handle the build up in their emotions.<br/>
<br/>
Kids need our help not our control until they behave as we tell them to.<br/>

are safe *and* supportive of their natural processes without <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Replace the word &quot;children&quot; with &quot;women&quot; - still agree with the <br/>
statement? <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t about &quot;allowing free reign&quot; but its not about <br/>
being ruled by one&#39;s kids, either. Its a different way of looking at <br/>
relationships, based on open communication. That&#39;s really <br/>
challenging to conceptualize - my own experience is that I had to <br/>
understand it a *little bit* and then practice for awhile and <br/>
stretch that understanding.<br/>
<br/>
Its true that children don&#39;t have the same skills and understanding <br/>
as adults, but that makes it all the more important to work toward <br/>
communicating with them in meaningful ways, rather than disregarding <br/>
the very real skills they do have in favor of &quot;teaching them a <br/>
lesson&quot;. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>No. People there have found TV to be a solution to what feels like an  <br/>
insurmountable problem. TV can be a source of comfort.<br/>
<br/>
TV is not the problem. The need for very bored women with few outlets  <br/>
to self-comfort is the problem. Taking away TV might give the  <br/>
illusion that the problem had gone away but it would just be buried  <br/>
beneath other behavior. And I&#39;m sure they had outlets for the boredom  <br/>
and frustration before and I&#39;d bet good money that there were a lot  <br/>
of unhealthy practices.<br/>
<br/>
If children are using TV as a way to comfort themselves -- as I did  <br/>
after school and on weekends when I was a kid -- the solution isn&#39;t  <br/>
to take away TV. The solution is to work at eliminating the stress  <br/>
that&#39;s causing the need for comfort.<br/>
<br/>
But unschooled kids shouldn&#39;t be using TV as a comfort for a stress  <br/>
that we have the power to eliminate. We should be eliminating the  <br/>
stress, not making ourselves feel better by eliminating the TV.<br/>
<br/>
Deschooling kids are recovering from stress. Sometimes that means a  <br/>
lot of TV (because it&#39;s relaxing *and* because it was often limited).  <br/>
But without the stress, without the limits, kids do move onto other  <br/>
things.<br/>

room when annoyed or insult my parents. (I had typical teenage  <br/>
irritation but it was a combination of hormones and disconnection  <br/>
with the family caused by school and traditional parenting.)<br/>
<br/>
TV doesn&#39;t cause people to disconnect with each other. People choose  <br/>
TV as a solution to other problems (stress, disconnection, boredom).  <br/>
That doesn&#39;t make TV the cause of the disconnection any more than  <br/>
food is the cause of people being overweight.<br/>
<br/>
People have problems. They seek solutions to those problems.  <br/>
Sometimes they choose solutions that make them feel better in the  <br/>
moment but don&#39;t get at the root cause of the problem and sometimes  <br/>
makes the problem worse.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t make the solution a demon. It doesn&#39;t help find a  <br/>
solution to put the responsibility for behavior on an outside source.  <br/>
The responsibility for our choices lies squarely with us.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; When I return to Canada in the summer, it&#39;s my<br/>
&gt; intention to completely forgo the TV.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And lots of people happily choose no TV or no electricity or no plastic.<br/>
<br/>
But unschooling is about opening our children&#39;s worlds, helping them  <br/>
explore *their* interests, not narrowing them.<br/>
<br/>
While moms can choose to live their own philosophies, if their  <br/>
choices limit their children, they&#39;ll be undermining unschooling and  <br/>
joyful living.<br/>
<br/>
Some moms are vegetarian while allowing their children freedom of  <br/>
food choice. Some moms forgo plastic while allowing their children to  <br/>
collect Happy Meal toys. Adopting a philosophy is choosing to make  <br/>
our lives more difficult in order to get something that we feel is  <br/>
better. Imposing a philosophy on someone else, making their lives  <br/>
more inconvenient for the sake of our philosophy, is not a way to  <br/>
build better relationships. It puts a philosophy ahead of family and  <br/>
tears down relationships.<br/>

Listeners might ask questions. They might have a point to make that  <br/>
couldn&#39;t wait, but basically we&#39;d be listening to the story.<br/>
<br/>
TV is a *source* of conversation for our family. It&#39;s a connection we  <br/>
all share together. We do pause the show to talk about it. But, like  <br/>
reading a book, we are focused on watching the story unfold.<br/>
<br/>
TV is no different than books. They&#39;re stories we can all enjoy and  <br/>

the images for you but those people are obviously not visual  <br/>
learners! Visuals are helpful and inspiring -- and for artists and  <br/>
writers especially -- necessary in order to build our own visuals  <br/>

it&#39;s necessary to have a wealth of visuals. TV is *one* source and an  <br/>

  This reminded me of something I overheard last summer at a local park.  The Mom was trying to get her son -- 5 or 6yo? -- stop doing whatever was doing. She said, &quot;If you don&#39;t stop that, there will be a big consequence.&quot;  Meaning she was going to manufacture a &#39;consquence&#39; for his misbehavior.  He chose not to comply and take his chances with her &#39;consequence.&#39;  I have to wonder if kids who are subjected to invented consequences have any real concept of what the natural consequences in life are.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have some current real-life experience with this - my 5yr old, Mo, <br/>
is very visual and also loves to draw. She has been experimenting <br/>
with perspective and also drawing in ways that express emotion. She <br/>
makes direct use of images and styles she sees on tv to explore <br/>
these concepts. Since her skills are still pretty &quot;basic&quot; - only <br/>
slightly more elaborate than stick figures - she finds cartoons to <br/>
be a rich source of information on how to better express near/far, <br/>
foreground/background, movement/stillness, and assorted emotions. <br/>
Classical art and drawing from life don&#39;t really help her do that, <br/>
but seeing the ways *other* artists have solved the same problems in <br/>
cartoon form does. <br/>
<br/>
Some of her drawing are &quot;just&quot; the characters she sees on tv - but <br/>
I&#39;ve taken drawing classes where I was asked to replicate specific <br/>
famous works or styles. She&#39;s using the same concept in her own <br/>
process. <br/>
<br/>
I want to point out that I&#39;m talking about pretty &quot;normal&quot; kinds of <br/>
drawings for a 5yr old. She&#39;s not a prodigy or something, just a <br/>
regular kid. I&#39;m saying this not to belittle her, but now and again <br/>
I&#39;ll hear an arguement against unschooling along the lines of &quot;oh, <br/>
well, that&#39;s fine for Gifted kids, but not everyone.&quot; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1415394761">What&#39;s funny is that we were very ANTI-box/electronics before <br/>
unschooling.  Over the last 5 years, we&#39;ve accumulated 3 cell phones <br/>
(one with a Bluetooth), 2 TV&#39;s (one with basic cable), 2 VCRS, 2 DVD <br/>
players, 2 computers (would be 3 but the laptop needs repair), a <br/>
GameBoy, a MP3 player, and our most recent addition...a PS2!  Not to <br/>
mention our Netflix and cable-internet subscriptions.<br/>
<br/>
For nearly 10 years I would have died had someone brought a game <br/>
system in my home.  Now, it&#39;s just another family gathering.  The <br/>
kids and DH don&#39;t like to play the 2 player games...instead they all <br/>
curl up in the bed and pass the controller around so they can <br/>
accumulate more stuff and better scores.  Everyone is laying there <br/>
cackling and rooting for the others.  And I *thought* &quot;boxes&quot; would <br/>
isolate everyone!!??  We&#39;re actually MORE connected now.<br/>

  I loved your responses.  It reminded me of a conversation I had today with my mother.<br/>
  It turns out in all her bragging about her other grandchildren and the way they are<br/>
  being raised, that they are accomplishing less and losing that natural curiosity so abundant in my kids.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I heard the &#39;oh..TV is evil....video games...aweful....(and my favorite).... she is trying by forcing him to read twenty minutes a day!<br/>
   <br/>
  Wow.  Do I feel sorry for my nephews.  Freedom to learn, explore, create, and just be, is a much nicer way to live.  I&#39;m glad we have those choices.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1712585129">&quot;oh, well, that&#39;s fine for Gifted kids, but not everyone.&quot; <br/>
   <br/>
  Oh, how I&#39;ve come to dislike this sentence.  People keep<br/>
  telling me that&#39;s why unschooling works for us.  Has it never<br/>
  occurred to them that maybe my kids are &quot;gifted&quot; BECAUSE<br/>
  of the unschooling principles of feeding their interests and <br/>
  spending time answering their questions?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1914481988">I wanted to weigh in on this, because we just finished a very interesting weekend. Josh&#39;s <br/>
party was yesterday, and the plan was a video game party. In our house, we have three <br/>
tv&#39;s, one with cable, five gaming systems, two vcrs and dvd players, five gameboys and <br/>
two DS&#39;s. My kids can take them or leave them. We can have days of gaming, and then <br/>
days without. The kids who came to the party however, all come from very limited homes. <br/>
One has to earn video time, point per point, another can&#39;t play until all chores and <br/>
homework are done. Three come from a home where no tv is allowed, unless it&#39;s <br/>
educational or religious, no video games at all. Two more have TV, but parents have <br/>
ultimate control and they have to share a GBA. Last two from a house where tv/gaming is <br/>
limited as punishments.<br/>
<br/>
I was amazed to see how very dedicated some kids were to the video games. It was painful <br/>
really, to see how emotionally dedicated they were, to getting a fair share of time. <br/>
Fortunately the girls totally understood this, and were able to step back and let the guys <br/>
gorge themselves. &quot;We can play whenever we want, we&#39;re lucky to have you...&quot; Awww. It <br/>
wasn&#39;t that long ago that I was pretty limiting on what I &#39;allowed&#39; the kids to watch.<br/>
<br/>
Today I took Josh shopping, and there was a mom who was looking at the games next to <br/>
us. She kept asking me what the rating was for this game or that, and I had no idea. She <br/>
was astonished, and asked me finally, &quot;Well, how do you know it&#39;s okay for the kids to <br/>
play?&quot; Um. Because I play with them? That didn&#39;t go over well, but her sons were okay with <br/>
it.<br/>
