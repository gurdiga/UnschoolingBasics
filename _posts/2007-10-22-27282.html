<div id="ygrps-yiv-1049399671">Hi, I&#39;m a grad student at Columbia writing about unschooling for my<br/>
master&#39;s thesis. Some of you may have seen my posts on other Yahoo groups.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking to talk to some New York City-area families who are either<br/>
considering unschooling, or committed but new to it. If anyone lives<br/>
in the area and would like to talk, that would be great.<br/>
<br/>
You can e-mail me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:kjb2141@...">kjb2141@...</a>. Looking forward to speaking<br/>
with you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1332938628">I&#39;m a long ago CU (GS & SIPA) graduate in the NY Capital Region, but I<br/>
go into NYC fairly frequently.  I started homeschooling this year with a<br/>
comprehensive plan, but I&#39;m slowly evolving into unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sharing what I learn about homeschooling, parenting, scouting, and<br/>
child advocacy on www.onlivingbylearning.blogspot.com<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.onlivingbylearning.blogspot.com">http://www.onlivingbylearning.blogspot.com</a>&gt; .  I would be happy to<br/>
speak to you.  My email is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:onthelongroad@...">onthelongroad@...</a><br/>
