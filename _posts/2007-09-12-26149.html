<div id="ygrps-yiv-2020245739">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
We have been unschooling now for a year, and are just starting into our <br/>
second year.  We haven&#39;t met any unschoolers in our area, but was <br/>
wondering if anyone has a child that would like to have a pen pal, or a <br/>
new friend?  We live in South Lyon, Michigan, and I have two children--<br/>
Tyler is 11 (will be 12 soon), and my daughter Alexandra is 10.  They <br/>
are both great kids and enjoy a variety of things--Tyler loves video <br/>
games, and is into Naruto, and Pokemon.  Alex is into the girly things- <br/>
like watching Hannah Montana, loves to read, loves animals, and <br/>
barbies, reading, and Disney Princesses.<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I would throw this out there, in case anyone is <br/>
interested.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
Vanessa</div>

<br/>
You should be able to connect with lots of unschoolers via postcards  <br/>
and the like via this group:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingaroundtheworld/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingaroundtheworld/</a><br/>
<br/>
a quote from the home page of the site:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Would members of your unschooling family get a kick out of sending  <br/>
&gt; and receiving postcards from other unschooling families around the  <br/>
&gt; world?! That is the purpose of this group -- to unite unschooling  <br/>
&gt; families from across the globe through tangible tokens of Joy  <br/>
&gt; delivered right to the mailbox!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>all the best<br/>
