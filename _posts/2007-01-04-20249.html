<div id="ygrps-yiv-471763660">the recent talk on the world of warcraft game being an addiction got <br/>
me thinking.<br/>
 the problem with an addiction is not the substance, it is what is <br/>
being denied awareness, what is being dulled out with the addiction. <br/>
the addiction is not for the high it is for the low after ward, a <br/>
defense against letting what your being wants you to know/ <br/>
understand/ work on/ through / deal with / engage with.  The <br/>
addiction is a numbing out it is a way not to engage, it is a flight <br/>
from a dawning awarenes of something uncomfortable. wow with an adult <br/>
might be an addiction, we as adults ( read masters of myriad of minor <br/>
and major deflective addictions) see it as a turning away a numbing <br/>
from reality, something repetive with not much challenge, the same <br/>
thing repeated over and over and over. kids on gamea stop if this <br/>
scenario presents itself ( read boring game) if they are engaged , <br/>
especially in an intense way it ain&#39;t no addiction. wow really is a <br/>
very complicated game that mirrors so many aspects of reality in <br/>
western culture; I mean the chosing of 2 professions alone; the need <br/>
for community/ help / cooperation in gathering materials and engaging <br/>
in quests; the big city the vast landscapes, the figuring iout how to <br/>
get around. <br/>
it seems like an ideal learning for engaging in our adult world.<br/>
 iof a kid was intensely engaged in music it would not be limited to <br/>
an hour of play , it is seen as something special, something to be <br/>
proud of to brag to other parents to, but frack , it ain&#39;t leadin to <br/>
nothing , or if engaged in american history again pride but what is <br/>
it good for? now what it is good for is that it is not the specifics <br/>
but the capacities/ containers for ideas a to be engaged that are <br/>
being formed. wow is at least as valuable, the knowledge base is more <br/>
likely to find analogous interface with future encounters in life. <br/>
 it is time to sing out and praise our kids for there dedication <br/>
their perseverence ( ideally not ot them or they will get to big <br/>
headed and this may distract them from further living at an intensity <br/>
we can only enviously oogle at. bu lets be parents old school and <br/>
brag and gloat of our kids acheivements on wow to our in laws and <br/>
parents and co workers; lets us not be ashamed but take up the banner <br/>
of unschooling to not be afraid; let us humbly ask our children (read <br/>
wise zen masters) to initiate us into this level of existence that <br/>
captures one&#39;s heart and soul.<br/>
I digress; now I don&#39;t hear any mention of what the kids feel or <br/>
think about their parents limiting their time on computers / wow. <br/>
why? they don&#39;t count? have they been engaged? they don&#39;t have any <br/>
thing to offer? if this is any where on the continuum of unschooling <br/>
it is an edge of a big bang about to split off in to an alternate <br/>
universe where our laws of physics and reality don&#39;t apply. <br/>
the parents are afraid, this is sad only if they don&#39;t engage their <br/>
fears , worries as something that resides in themselves, as something <br/>
they don&#39;r like, as something they need to understand not as <br/>
something to obliterate with control, &quot; there is no monster in that <br/>
closet if I just think happy thoughts it nain&#39;t there&quot; open your eyes <br/>
it is there it is in you , it is why you are driven to addiction, the <br/>
coffee, the bag o chips and other lovely addictive modalities. please <br/>
don&#39;t feed this to your kids , if you try to control them they will <br/>
understand no matter how they might resist, that yes there is <br/>
something very wrong in the world and i need to be very afraid, my <br/>
parents can only show me how to hide and cower then pretend so <br/>
daintily that I am a burger of this town I have control &quot;but shiver <br/>
did you hear that sound is it  the evil king approaching.<br/>
 dang talk to your kids they can show you a different way if you have <br/>
the courage to begin a relationship with them, if you don&#39;t it truly <br/>
is a sin of humanity to teach them that the parents who begot their <br/>
hides are also cowards in a world of fear.<br/>
please i beg you parents join the new guild of unschooler world of <br/>
warcraft players and awaken to the existence you were born for , the <br/>
time has come, you must choose quicky<br/>

be double the power double the fun in a few days and do Burning Crusade mid <br/>
January. Here&#39;s hoping that the UK folk can play on US servers so we can <br/>
join the unschooling guild.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1911576295">I liked and think I understood this post, yet I still have a question.<br/>
What about when the &quot;addiction&quot; to an online game is being used as a<br/>
shelter from what is scary to a sensitive person about life away from<br/>
the computer? Do we always trust that very sensitive children will<br/>
eventually have the will to leave the relatively safe haven of<br/>
make-believe to find a way to support themselves?<br/>
I do know a young lady who spent all her time playing an on-line game at<br/>
the age of 21, while coming to grips with anxieties made worse by her<br/>
parents nasty problems. She did step away after a year or so & is happy<br/>
to be making her own money.<br/>
Still, I worry about my 14yo boy, who was sooo damaged by the school<br/>
system. He is already obsessive-compulsive & after much rejection by<br/>
other kids, doesn&#39;t have a great desire to socialize in person.  He<br/>
happily plays 8 bit games in an online community where the kids create<br/>
their own games & chat while playing (Beyond).  His computer time is not<br/>
limited. These days he rotates between Beyond, Oblivion & the Wii. I<br/>
remember the friendly young child I knew & wonder if he will hide at<br/>
home forever? The more I read these lists, the less I think so but many<br/>
of the children we are discussing have never lived through as many<br/>
negative experiences as Nick. Nor are they already facing the internal<br/>
struggles that OCD & Tourette syndrome place on my son everyday. I would<br/>
think he has more reason to use virtual communities to escape. <br/>
I&#39;ve already made the leap of faith & unschool him, I just worry about<br/>
the future, given his special challenges. I read to escape. Sooner or<br/>
later, I get bored & go looking for challenge. These games are many and<br/>
varied. It&#39;s the very fact that they are so challenging that worries me.<br/>
Why should he ever leave them?<br/>

 <br/>
ps:All the talk of WOW has made me mention it to Nick. I think he finds<br/>
the graphics rather intense & uncomfortable looking for his taste so he<br/>
probably won&#39;t join the guild.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Unschooling isn&#39;t about standing back waiting for a child to do  <br/>
whatever. It&#39;s about being involved with our children and their  <br/>
lives. Sometimes they do need us to step back and let them mess  <br/>
about. But we need to know them well enough in order to know when  <br/>
that is.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling parents have an awareness of what a child is getting from  <br/>
what they&#39;re doing by talking about it and being involved enough to  <br/>
carry on a conversation. We shouldn&#39;t have to guess whether an  <br/>
intense amount of anything is a passion or a withdrawal.<br/>
