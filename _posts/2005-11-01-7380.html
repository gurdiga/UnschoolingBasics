<div id="ygrps-yiv-2146941334">I had to share with you all, despite yesterdays upset<br/>
email that I sent, I haven&#39;t done a lick of teaching<br/>
today.  However, dd is an avid animal lover.  A few<br/>
weeks ago at Barnes and Noble she asked for the book<br/>
&quot;Dog:  The Complete Guide&quot;, by Sarah Whitehead...we<br/>
have the cat one too and we&#39;re having a Cat Show in<br/>
Pensacola in a couple of weeks...YIPPEE<br/>
<br/>
Alright, here is the &quot;Oh, NO!&quot; part...DD wanted to try<br/>
and figure out what is the matter with our 10 year old<br/>
male, American Bulldog, he stinks regularly even just<br/>
after having a bath.  She flips over to the &quot;Grooming&quot;<br/>
section of her book and reads.  Well low and behold<br/>
she comes to a section about anal blockage and how a<br/>
dog will scoot his bottom on the floor and lick their<br/>
anal area regularly and that the dog will smell.  The<br/>
books gives detailed instructions about how to remove<br/>
the blockage from the dogs anus.  She wants to give<br/>
Vince a full &quot;veterinary exam&quot; :-), but says that the<br/>
anal blockage removal will have to be done by mom or<br/>
dad!....LOL  I don&#39;t know guys, I have a very weak<br/>
stomache.  <br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to share a cute moment.<br/>

a large German Shepherd at the time (back when I was in college, it <br/>
was my parents&#39; dog). Dogs can&#39;t use an oral thermometer because <br/>

-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
He could still stink because he&#39;s been towel-dried or allowed to air-dry. Dogs have a lot of natural oils that hold in odor. (Keep in mind that they are predators/scavengers and holding odors is considered a (good* thing! &lt;g&gt;) If you can get a forced air dryer and make sure he&#39;s dry TO THE SKIN, he won&#39;t stink as soon as usual.<br/>

 <br/>
OR...he has anal glands that are irritating him. These are like the scent glands on a skunk. Normally, they are expressed naturally when he moves his bowels (but the processed foods we use don&#39;t help the situation naturally! &lt;G&gt;). They are little tear-shaped glands located at about 4:30 and 7:30 under his rectum. They can be expressed manually from the inside or the outside. Most dogs HATE internal expressing--and that should be left to a vet, but most tolerate external expressing just fine. You just push the glands up and in: a liquid or sometimes a paste comes out the rectum.<br/>
 <br/>

stomache.  <br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;d have a vet show her how to do it correctly---or show YOU! &lt;G&gt; The worst thing is the stench that it produces---and if you&#39;re not IN the tub with a ready water source or using a paper towel that you can throw away asap (and the wash your hands even faster!), it *can* spray an amazing distance, and the stink can stick on you for a long, long time! <br/>
 <br/>
Keep in mind that this is a GLAND!!!! Just like mammary glands, the more it is expressed, the more it will *need* to be expressed. I always *check*  to see whether a gland is infected or impacted, but I don&#39;t express every gland that walks in! I just *check* manually, expressing a *tiny* bit to see.<br/>
 <br/>
Soemtimes a dog will express them under duress---dog fights, extreme fear, other things will cause a dog to express them automatically. The stench is unmistakable! &lt;G&gt; Every dog is diferent: some need the expressed, some don&#39;t, some need them removed!<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s not something everyone would choose to do, but remember: I scrub dogs&#39; butts for a living! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

Two Questions<br/>
<br/>
1) Are you an animal groomer and/or vet?  You said<br/>
scrub dogs butts for a living, hence the question :-)<br/>
2) Did you love animals as a child?<br/>

<br/>
We are having a Cat Show here in a couple of weeks, dd<br/>
is an animal lover but cats are her favorite, she<br/>
wants to go to both shows.  Who knows what will come<br/>
of this?  If nothing does, that&#39;s okay but her love<br/>
for cats and animals in general is something that I<br/>
never spoke so much of as a child.  <br/>

  Are you a groomer?? It sounds like it. I was going to say the same things you did. Another solution for smelly dogs are using a very mild watered down dish washer detergent to get those oils washed out. Just be aware some dogs can get dry skin but some dogs can be washed many times a week with it and be fine ( We use in some show dogs).<br/>
  Also I completely agree about the diet. Diet is a the big culprit of 95% of all dogs skin allergies, odor, itchy skim, etc. It is so bad many veterinarians just put those dogs on corticoids( sp?) and just treat the symptoms when all they need is a better diet.<br/>

Thanks Kelly for the wealth of info!<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
Yeah---probably way more than you wanted to know! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
1) Are you an animal groomer and/or vet?  You said<br/>
scrub dogs butts for a living, hence the question :-)<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
I groom dogs mostly. I&#39;ll do cats too, on occasion (some cats are better than th dogs! &lt;G&gt; <br/>
I&#39;ve also done a few rabbits, a ferret (won&#39;t do that again!), and a whole bunch of show horses.<br/>
 <br/>
When Cameron was in school (and I was the really COOL homeroom mom), one of Cameron&#39;s <br/>
&quot;friends&quot; (whose mother is a *banker*) told Cameron is a sneery voice, &quot;You&#39;re mom scrubs<br/>
dogs&#39; BUTTS for a living!&quot; I assured the unhappy Cameron that Peyton was right: I DO scrub <br/>
dogs&#39; butts. But that I&#39;m happy to---and I&#39;m also quite happy to charge Peyton&#39;s mom extra <br/>
for her nasty little shih tzu. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
2) Did you love animals as a child?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
Of course. I always wanted to be a vet---since I was five. I would proudly tell anyone <br/>
who asked that I was going to be a veterinarian (and I knew how to spell it by the time I was<br/>
six! &lt;bwg&gt;). I took five years of high school Latin and one semester of college Greek (not <br/>
to mention the French, Spanish and German too!---as well as biology, physics, and chemistry <br/>
I & II in high school. I was *very* academic because I sooo wanted to get into vet school.<br/>
 <br/>
I found in college though that I was more suited to languages (duh!) and business than the <br/>
sciences (even though I LOVE biology and genetics and physics and astronomy and ... &lt;g&gt;). <br/>
I changed to German & business but never graduated.  <br/>
 <br/>
I groomed my own show dogs, as well as those of friends, and I groomed all the horses at the <br/>
barn (clippering, pulling and braiding manes & tails, and finishing touches---like <br/>
checkerboards on their rumps). <br/>
 <br/>
I fell into grooming as a business when we were living in Germany, and some officer&#39;s wife <br/>
said she coulsn&#39;t find a dog groomer in town who spoke English well enough to groom her <br/>
Samoyeds. I came home and told Ben that *I* could groom a Samoyed; maybe I should get a few <br/>
more tools and advertise? I was SWAMPED within months! &lt;G&gt; I&#39;ve made a living with grooming <br/>
ever since! I specialize in sporting dogs (spaniels and setters), hand-scissoring poodles and <br/>
shih tzus & Lhasas, and handstripping terriers (one of my Standard Schnauzers is in the top <br/>
ten right now! WooHoo! &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m sooo glad I didn&#39;t pursue vet school. I have two good friends who are vets and who are <br/>
happy, but they have such high overhead and staffing problems and no vacations and people who <br/>
refuse to pay and sick and dying animals that hate to see them! &lt;G&gt; My clients leave looking <br/>
and feeling better than they did when they got here! &lt;G&gt; LOTS of *instant* job satisfaction! <br/>
 <br/>
And no one dies! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

 <br/>
Many groomers do too, but professional use of dish detergent and that of the average pet owner: two HUGELY different situations! NO ONE GO OUT AND USE DISH DETERGENT ON YOUT PET!  Alex is right: it can and often *does* burn the tender skin of dogs. ALso don&#39;t use human shampoo---we have a different pH, and it can burn their skin too.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
  Also I completely agree about the diet. Diet is a the big culprit of 95% of <br/>

they need is a better diet.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Bingo! Plus---handstripping of terriers (combined with diet) can eliminate skin & coat problems like magic.  <br/>
 <br/>
Were you a junior handler? I was---started at 12, and I judge juniors now. I don&#39;t show much right now (just my standard schnauzer clients a couple of times)---we have a 12 year old rescue German shepherd dog, a drop-dead gorgeous beagle with a gay tail, and a guide dog viszla puppy (who leaves in 3.5 weeks!). I&#39;m qualified to judge Weimaraners and viszlak, but I haven&#39;t applied to judge them yet. Maybe never will. Hard to say.<br/>
 <br/>
What do you show? Where?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m VERY interested in spinning, but couldn&#39;t manage a drop spindle <br/>
and we have very limited budget and space at the moment, so a <br/>
spinning wheel is not possible yet.  I&#39;ve considered sending the hair <br/>
out to someone to spin, but I haven&#39;t gotten around to finding <br/>
someone (and hubby gets a bit frustrated with bags of hair sitting <br/>
around).<br/>
<br/>
I do crochet and have in the past knit (I alternate through different <br/>
crafts, with counted crosstitch being my most frequent choice) and <br/>
plan to do a whole lot more of it in the future (once we have our own <br/>
home).<br/>
<br/>
They are gorgeous, but quite a bit of work to keep them from getting <br/>
matted.  What amazes most people is that they stay white all by <br/>
themselves (without baths) because their fur &quot;sheds&quot; dirt.  My Angel <br/>
(my female and younger dog) will come in muddy from digging, fall <br/>
asleep in the bathroom, and in the morning a clean dog walks out and <br/>
a pile of dirt is left on the floor without any intervention on my <br/>
part.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if you want to talk more, email me off list as I think we&#39;ve <br/>
wandered far enough off topic for the moment.  :)</div>

up much space, wasn&#39;t outrageously expensive, easily transportable in  <br/>

Contact a fiber, weaving or spinning guild.  You could either rent a spinning wheel for cheap or trade someone to spin the dog hair in exchange for some of it.  I&#39;ve seen dog hair knitted into as an accent into a sweater and I drooled over it!  :P~~~~   So beautiful.<br/>

We have 2 short hair dogs and 4 cats (one of which is long hair).  She regularly grooms them, but would like to start grooming others.  She&#39;s been talking about putting up flyers in our neighborhood.  We just moved into a new house with a two car garage which would be perfect for &quot;Hope&#39;s Doggie Salon&quot;.

 </span></blockquote>LOL...See guys, going off topic actually helped!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;but my 10 yo dd is very, very<br/>
&gt; interested in grooming dogs and cats.  We have 2<br/>
&gt; short hair dogs and 4 cats (one of which is long<br/>
&gt; hair).  She regularly grooms them, but would like to<br/>
&gt; start grooming others.  She&#39;s been talking about<br/>
&gt; putting up flyers in our neighborhood.  We just<br/>
&gt; moved into a new house with a two car garage which<br/>
&gt; would be perfect for &quot;Hope&#39;s Doggie Salon&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Our daughters would be great friends!  Brooke loves to<br/>
groom our cat and desires to do the same for the dog.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;My<br/>
&gt; question is this, do you need to have a<br/>
&gt; certification or license like hairdressers?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Good question, I&#39;d like to know that too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1363772027">I would find your kids a groomer that needs help and is really good with animals and in what she does.<br/>
  Your dds can start by helping the groomer to give baths and some brushing and so on.<br/>
  Or maybe help a dog handler or breeder that shows dogs and do grooming.<br/>
  There is more to learn than just brushing a dog. Also the simple task of giving a dog a bath requires the your dds know a little about dogs and their temperament etc. I would not want them to get bitten by a dog. Even nice dogs can bite.<br/>
  I started out by cleaning the kennels of a show handler and then helping get puppies walking on a leash and then giving then baths....<br/>
  That way they learn the whole concept about how to take care of the animals from cleaning , feeding, etc.<br/>
  Working for someone is the way to do it when you are 10 years old.<br/>
  Maybe Kelly has some other great ideas.<br/>
  Also you do not need to be certified a groomer. Many groomers who went to grooming school ( I used to train groomers for PetSmart) are not good and others who never had classes are the best ( Does that surprise any Unschooler???)<br/>
  The best groomers in my opinion start out just loving and wanting to know more about dogs your dds and started by helping someone knowledgeable who they learned from . You have to learn to fully atke care of a dog ( or cat) to be a good groomer.<br/>
  Good luck,<br/>

I wrote a looong response, and my computer froze up again. Then I read Alex&#39;s! &lt;G&gt; Good advice.<br/>

ANd that&#39;s a great age to start handling in junior showmanship! Become a member of your local kennel club, find a breed you love, hook up with a reputable show breeder, start showing in juniors, and offer to do grunt work for a top handler. You learn SOO much in the sport!<br/>
 <br/>

  Maybe Kelly has some other great ideas.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-==-<br/>
 <br/>
Yeah--- I did. damn this computer! I&#39;ll see whether I can add anything before it spits everything back at me again! <br/>
 <br/>
I would add that house/pet-sitting is a great way to get your foot in the door. So is pooper scooping! And a great way to make $$ even at so young an age!<br/>
 <br/>
My garage groom room is tiny! Just big enough for a raised tub (a MUST!) and a table. You don&#39;t want a big area---smaller&#39;s better---you don&#39;t want to be carrying a sopping wet collie ten feet from the tub to the table; a pivot is better! I keep my crates outside my room. <br/>
 <br/>
Buy high quality equipment. It makes the job sooo much easier!<br/>
 <br/>

  Also you do not need to be certified a groomer. Many groomers who went to <br/>

 <br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Right! <br/>
 <br/>
Many people are trying to require licensure for groomers. I think that&#39;s just to cut down on competition and to make $$ for all the schools that are popping up around the country. Folks like me (with no schoolin&#39;) would be grandfathered in, so they say.  I learned by doing---by listening to my clients, by talking with handlers and breeders and by putting my hands on as many GOOD dogs as possible.<br/>
 <br/>
You can be certified as a master groomer by a couple of different organizations by taking a written test and then grooming four dogs in front of them. And you can be certified in *just* terriers, sporting, or nonsporting breeds---again by grooming dogs in front of someone who&#39;s certified to give you certification! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Some schools will hand out certificates of completion of the course---that&#39;s NOT the same thing! Although some people have tried to pass it off as such! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>

I agree---but it&#39;s not just about loving dogs! Knowing the proper way to deal with animals is KEY! All the love in the world won&#39;t keep you from getting bitten or keep you from slicing off an important piece of flesh! &lt;G&gt; Animal behavior---understanding them and knowing what will and won&#39;t work is very important. Cats especially!---I LOVE to work with cats, and there&#39;s a special niche (and big bucks!) for those that are willing to handle cats!<br/>
 <br/>
But I&#39;ll add that you MUST be willing and able to deal with the HUMAN clients as well! The dogs really don&#39;t care how they look---it&#39;s the owner you have to please! I&#39;ve heard many times over the years: &quot;OH! I just LOVE animals---I hate people and would rather deal with the animals!&quot; Yeah---right. Fido doesn&#39;t write the check! You MUST deal with the human aspect as well! And the better you are at THAT, the better your business will be!<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m sorry my other post was lost---oh but I do remember writing that I&#39;ll do just about anything to get you lurkers out of lurkdom---including scrubbing dogs&#39; butts!! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes Yes Yes that is why I said I did not want them to get bitten. When you learn about dogs ( or cats) while you are cleaning, etc. is about how they.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  And yes even a bath can be dangerous to a dog or groomer . Old dogs, short nosed dogs, dogs with pain ( due to bad hips, arthritis, etc.), dogs with bulging eyes ( that can ulcerate easy), bad ears,....can be a problem  if you don&#39;t really know what your doing.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I just had to laugh so hard at this because it is so true!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  To have a successful grooming business you have to be good with the owners.<br/>
  And they can be sooo hard to please sometimes. And you have to be able to communicate really well to find out their true expectations. Sometimes they say they want the dog all shaved clean when they really wanted the dog with more than 2 inches of fluffy hair.<br/>
  But it is fun! And I had a blast when I was a child. I was also lucky that my mom let me go to shows and miss school and was all for me doing what I loved. I think my mom would have been an unschooling mom   if she had learned that was an option.<br/>
  I think what Kelly said about getting the girls to show as a junior handler is great.<br/>
  You can loolk up more at akc.org for what is all about and your local club.<br/>
