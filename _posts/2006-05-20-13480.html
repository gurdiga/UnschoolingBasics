  I still don&#39;t get what your 4-H leader was so upset about&quot;<br/>
<br/>
About the fact that Lesa called some kids out on a really obvious<br/>
prejudice!!:)  She probably didn&#39;t like the light being shined on<br/>
&quot;her&quot; group. Ah well..as Kelly&#39;s bumper sticker says &quot;The truth will<br/>

And not after the conferences either! Once you go and connect with all these real life unschoolers, your community becomes vast! My kids and I have been all over the country visiting unschoolers we have met on these lists and at conferences. Our lives are full and we&#39;ve been able to carry that fullness back to our own hometown. It&#39;s enabled us to be proud of our &quot;differences&quot; and that has brought like minded souls into our everyday lives. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I am seeking out the minority of unschoolers and like minded people (i.e.<br/>
attachment parenting...) in my area... I just joined a &quot;crunchy&quot; yahoo group<br/>
centralized in a town about 30 - 40 minutes from me... and she said it was<br/>
like herding cats... I think we all like to stay in hiding around here<br/>
because the mainstream community in our area just runs us off.<br/>
<br/>
anyhow... the conference for this year isn&#39;t going to work out... but I can<br/>
plan for next year!  :) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1304388923">Well, if it makes you feel better, I got the shunning tonight.:)<br/>
<br/>
We had some ghosthunters here, doing a class for my sis&#39;s family and<br/>
two of my children. Part of the time they were dousing in my backyard<br/>
while our conservative Christian neighbors had some church friends over.<br/>
<br/>
Just a few minutes ago, all of the children that were next door, ended<br/>
up in our yard happily chatting with my children. They were interested<br/>
in the trampoline and I told Sierra to check with their parents first.<br/>
Before she could do that, three parents came RUNNING into my yard<br/>
shouting the children&#39;s names and literally dragging them out of my<br/>
yard as fast as they could. &quot;Kayla come her RIGHT NOW&quot; one of them<br/>
screamed.<br/>
<br/>
I yelled &quot;it&#39;s fine with us if they want to jump, as long as it&#39;s ok<br/>
with you&quot;  <br/>
The mother would hardly look at me but muttered &quot;we&#39;re leaving soon&quot;.<br/>
They&#39;re still here. I don&#39;t think it had anything to do with needing<br/>
to leave...sigh.<br/>

<br/>
Mostly lurker, here, wondering if there are any unschoolers in Medford <br/>
Oregon who would like to get together when we are there for the month of <br/>
June/early July?  My girls are 7 and 2, and will be learing to ride <br/>
horesback while we are there visiting family.  I am sure we will have <br/>
lots of time we could get together in!<br/>
