<div id="ygrps-yiv-1489602605">I mostly lurk on this list but I find the discussions SO VERY interesting.  <br/>
DS is 17 months (stepson is in PS) so I&#39;m learning the lifestyle right now.  I <br/>
have a clarification question.  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve known stepson for almost 5 years now.  Because he&#39;s getting older I&#39;ve <br/>
been stuck about how to get some help with chores around the house.  I can&#39;t do <br/>
it all myself and DH is a neat freak.  He tries to understand that my <br/>
full-time job is being mama/stepmama to our DS and his DS (who is with us half time) <br/>
but he has trouble with the house being so messy (that doesn&#39;t mean he won&#39;t <br/>
pick up himself if it bothers him that much - he does do that).  We&#39;ve done <br/>
family meetings which has helped a lot.  Stepson really enjoys being an equal <br/>
participant in the meetings.  That has been one way for me to get some help.  Let <br/>
everyone know what my needs are and ask what everyone is willing to do to <br/>
assist me in getting those needs me.  No coercion needed.  Everyone has been very <br/>
willing to participate and help out - in theory.  <br/>
 <br/>
Before DH and I started considering Unschooling we had a rule that when <br/>
stepson finished playing with something he would need to pick it up before he moved <br/>
on to something else.  We helped if he needed it and it was never a battle.  <br/>
Now we don&#39;t have &quot;rules&quot; like that.  But I&#39;ve been wondering how other <br/>
families make the chore thing work.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not complicated for those of you <br/>
doing it the respectful way and feeling like you *know* that way and are <br/>
comfortable with it.  I&#39;ve been struggling with this - how to I get things done <br/>
without any help.  It&#39;s just not possible.  So let me see if I have this right.  <br/>
It&#39;s not a problem to ask for help.  I just can&#39;t expect everyone to jump up <br/>
immediately and do it NOW because I wouldn&#39;t want to be treated that way.  As <br/>
long as they have an &quot;I&#39;m busy right now&quot; out (or something like that), then <br/>
it&#39;s fine to ask.  Is that the way you all do it?  As I said, we&#39;ve done the <br/>
family meeting and it works pretty well, but I can&#39;t expect a Kindergartner to <br/>
remember everything he said he wanted to help with by mid-week.  He just doesn&#39;t <br/>
remember everything he was so enthusiastic to help with.  <br/>
 <br/>

Neat freaks shouldn&#39;t force their &quot;religion&quot; on other people.  If he  want <br/>
the house spotless, he can come home from work and clean it up  himself.<br/>
 <br/>
I know plenty of women will say, &quot;aw he makes the living...the least I can  <br/>
do is clean the house!&quot;  Yeah, you can clean it....to your standards and as  <br/>
you can get things done that you see need doing.  He can do the same.   If those <br/>
two perspectives are different, so be it.   <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not your responsibility to clean the house to HIS standards, it&#39;s  his.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, the truth is ... we don&#39;t.  LOL  How&#39;s that for the quick answer? <br/>
  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Now, for the longer answer -- we don&#39;t use the word &quot;chore&quot; and really <br/>
not even the word &quot;work&quot; when talking about cleaning our home.  Chore <br/>
usually has a drudging &quot;oh man this sucks&quot; connotation to it so, for <br/>
us, I feel that it&#39;s just better not even to use the word.  I know from <br/>
my own upbringing that &quot;chores&quot; were a very bad thing and were used as <br/>
punishments, and conversely, punishable for not completing.  Blah!<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, I don&#39;t have a magic spell that you cast a la Hermione <br/>
Granger.  Different families are going to have their own take on how <br/>
things could be done at their home so the best I can do is steer you <br/>
over to Sandra Dodd&#39;s page called &quot;Living Better without Requiring <br/>
Chores&quot;.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-613100593">&lt;&lt;&lt;It&#39;s not your responsibility to clean the house to HIS standards, it&#39;s<br/>
his.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree with this in principle, and it also applies to the idea that an<br/>
adult&#39;s standards are likely to different from a kid&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
However I wanted to share something that happened over here, a while ago<br/>
now, but it did change my perspective a bit.<br/>
<br/>
Our house is pretty messy, but at one time was much more so than usual for a<br/>
while. Jayn was very little at the time, and not being the big creator that<br/>
she is now. I was just letting things go some, feeling a little overwhelmed<br/>
and resentful - alone in the task. I hadn&#39;t learnt to ask for help very well<br/>
yet. Dh was getting snappier and grumpier. And there were some arguments,<br/>
where I was baffled at the intensity of his emotions. I mean he is the<br/>
person who would step over the doll five times, and then explode about mess<br/>
and make it my responsibility, rather than just pick up the doll the first<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
It finally came out, with many tears on both our parts, that he was afraid I<br/>
didn&#39;t love him anymore and was planning to leave him, because I wasn&#39;t<br/>
taking care of &quot;his home&quot;. He truly saw (sees) the housework I do as a gift<br/>
of love to him. It had never occurred to me to see it that way, just as I<br/>
don&#39;t think it occurred to him to have to express that idea, and his<br/>
gratitude, to me. He just tried to &quot;force&quot; my love back by demanding I clean<br/>
up. Since from my perspective my love hadn&#39;t gone away I just got hurt and<br/>
angry. <br/>
<br/>
Things have been way better since. He is more relaxed, or at least acceptant<br/>
of the times when the house gets out of hand. I try harder to stay on top of<br/>
things and am much more successful at asking for help, including regular<br/>
purges of accumulated clutter - my stuff only, sometimes his. Jayn is a<br/>
hoarder at the moment. He is also more grateful, and I do all I can to<br/>
express love and reassurance to him in other ways.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, he isn&#39;t supposed to keep a running list of promises. If he&#39;s busy, just<br/>
do whatever the task is.<br/>
<br/>
Think of the tasks as yours and you&#39;re asking for help. If he&#39;s busy, then<br/>
the task is still your responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
You can also try &quot;Let&#39;s get this cleaned up,&quot; projecting an attitude of<br/>
that&#39;s just what we do. You can give him specific things to do. You could<br/>
say &quot;Would you help me put these pieces back in the game?&quot; Or after you&#39;ve<br/>
picked something up you can say &quot;Could you put that on the shelf for me<br/>
please?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Treat him as though he&#39;s already your partner and doing the best he can and<br/>
he&#39;ll do the best he can. :-) Treat him as conscripted labor and it&#39;s<br/>
possible he&#39;ll figure out how to do the barest minumum possible to fulfill<br/>
his obligation.<br/>
