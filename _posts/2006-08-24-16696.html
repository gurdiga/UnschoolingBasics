<div id="ygrps-yiv-66662098">I know that it is always the same questions that arise, but  ...<br/>
<br/>
This is my own version of the &quot;food control&quot; problem ... <br/>
<br/>
I have decided to let it go, as the rest, and to give my kids what <br/>
they ask, when they ask (while proposing choice, sometimes, to check <br/>
whether they are hungry or really want a cookie). I try not to be <br/>
judgemental about their choices, and I must say that most of the <br/>
time, it is OK for me and for them. <br/>
<br/>
But I DO have a problem, though. They like to drink milk with <br/>
chocolate in baby&#39;s bottles ... They can drink four or five each day <br/>
and that worries me A LOT. I am afraid of the long term effects on <br/>
their health. My sister, who was a nurse, took care of a man whose <br/>
liver was destroyed by milk - he was drinking a liter or so <br/>
everyday. I have the feeling of poisoning them by giving them so <br/>
much milk and cocoa. <br/>
<br/>
So here is my question : how can I deal with my anxiety when they <br/>
ask me ANOTHER bottle without controlling them ? It&#39;s really very <br/>
difficult to let go (and I must add that they haven&#39;t been very much <br/>
controlled about food in general and bottles in particular, so I <br/>
don&#39;t think that they are compensating - I really think that they <br/>
are fond of this kind of feeding ...<br/>
<br/>
Once more, sorry for my English, hope you still understand my <br/>
questions and thank you in advance for your answers - I really look <br/>
forward to reading them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve never heard of a connection between milk and liver disease. In  <br/>
fact glancing through what Google turns up for &quot;milk liver disease&quot;  <br/>
shows that 2 8-ounce glasses (about a quarter of a liter) are  <br/>
recommended as part of the diet for people with liver disease. My  <br/>
husband has been drinking at least that much most of his life and  <br/>
he&#39;s almost 50.<br/>
<br/>
There are people who are very anti-milk. I glanced through the anti- <br/>
milk sites and no one mentions liver disease. I see allergies,  <br/>
lactose intolerance, anemia mentioned. I seem to remember people  <br/>
mentioning a connection between childhood infections and milk drinking.<br/>
<br/>
Information is often a good cure for fears!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, before we found unschooling, our pediatrician told us Jacob was <br/>
drinking too much milk and that it was keeping him from eating enough. <br/>
He liked many, many cups a day. We didn&#39;t want to force him to not <br/>
drink milk, so we just watered it down...tasted good enough <br/>
apparently. He still drank the same amount of cups, we said &quot;yes&quot; <br/>
whenever he asked, and he just got more water with it. As he got <br/>
older, we took to leaving full sport-top water bottles in each room. <br/>
Water replaced milk as his primary drink over time. Covenience:)  Now, <br/>
he can get his own milk and juice, but mostly drinks water by choice.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe talk to them about your concerns (although I would look into the <br/>
fears and science behind them) and ask for possible solutions. <br/>
<br/>
We do milkshakes here, adding bananas or berries or eggs or Kefir to <br/>
up the food value (and make it more filling). Mine like straws.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1127238928">I&#39;m new to unschooling with food and bedtimes as well, so keep this in <br/>
mind with my answer, as I&#39;m trying, like you, to unschool food.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d would make a suggestion like:  &quot;I think it would be neat to try <br/>
juice or milk in the bottle too&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
With my kids, they would make it into some kind of game - testing to <br/>
see if it tasted different, if it came out faster, etc.<br/>
<br/>
You could always make a few convience cups of juice or water and put <br/>
them in the fridge.  I know my kids will pick the already made cup if <br/>
they are just thirsty and don&#39;t care what they drink.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-712902468">How about getting rice milk?<br/>
<br/>
Soy milk may *not* be a good choice for boys.  You would need to read up on <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
You could also purchase almond milk.  Or, you could make it fun to make the <br/>
almond milk yourself (real easy, just water and ground nuts, I think).  <br/>
<br/>
If you are still lactating, you could pump and store.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe try carob instead of cocoa.<br/>
<br/>
You could even put rice milk in the cow milk container; or carob in the cocoa <br/>
container.  Not so keen on this deceptive model, though.<br/>
<br/>
My concern over too much cows milk, is that it is made for a cow.  The <br/>
calcium to phosphorus ratio is more for those huge bones of a cow than for a child.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1264875138">Could you offer rice milk mixed w/ cocoa instead?  We drink Vanilla Rice Dream here, and it&#39;s pretty yummy, creamy and I bet w/ chocolate added (which my son does occassionally, but I&#39;ve never tasted it, yet) it might be good.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Four or five cups each day wouldn&#39;t worry me - but not sure how big a  <br/>
&quot;bottle&quot; might be, so maybe you&#39;re talking about a lot more than  <br/>
that? I&#39;ve forgotten how old they are - but as they get older, you  <br/>
might want to switch to nonfat milk to cut down on saturated fats.  <br/>
And I wouldn&#39;t worry about the chocolate, either, unless they are  <br/>
having it at night and it might be keeping them awake because of the  <br/>
caffeine.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re worried about milk containing hormones or antibiotics or  <br/>
having an inappropriate chemical make-up for human children, etc.,  <br/>
then switch to organic milk, rice milk, almond milk, etc.<br/>
<br/>
But, really, I&#39;d guess this is something that will simply pass -  <br/>
assuming you don&#39;t try to restrict it. I bet they won&#39;t be drinking a  <br/>
daily four or five bottles of chocolate milk when they&#39;re 17 years  <br/>
old &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
If you haven&#39;t gotten it yet, please get the book, &quot;Let Them Eat Cake.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And stop being &quot;afraid&quot; and start getting good solid information -  <br/>
vague fears are insidious - they get between us and rational behavior.<br/>
