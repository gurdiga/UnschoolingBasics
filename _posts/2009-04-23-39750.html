<div id="ygrps-yiv-896481569">I&#39;m so glad to read that you are thinking about all of this and why you feel the way you do.<br/>
<br/>
We have relatives who lived through the Depression and it is amazing to see the differences between them when it comes to money/things issues. One has no money problems in old age and is quite happy and the other has nothing but money-related problems and is miserable and miserable to be around. The surprising part is that it is the one with more money who has all the problems. All brought on by her reactions to money/things issues, not the reality of her bank balance. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck sorting out a happy path for yourself! :)<br/>
