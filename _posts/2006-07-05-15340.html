Compared to whom?  I would start thinking of her as just the right size <br/>
rather than tiny.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Our 6 year old (Sam) is a sugar addict.  We have always had candy and junk <br/>
but I rationed it until a few months ago when I stopped telling my children what <br/>
to eat.  He has a history of anemia and low energy and we have carried him a <br/>
lot due to his fatigue, since he was born.<br/>
<br/>
On Monday we visited a 100 acre park and he ran and climbed and lead the rest <br/>
of us through the museums and gardens.  My husband pointed out how much <br/>
energy he&#39;s had lately and how we haven&#39;t had to carry him in a few months.  I <br/>
later mentioned it to Sam and said that he seemed to have a lot more energy since <br/>
he&#39;s been eating healthier.  His response was &quot;No, Mom, I have more energy <br/>
since I&#39;ve been eating what I want.&quot;  The latter is true.  He has been having ice <br/>
cream for breakfast sometimes, a lot of soda because of the cookout season, <br/>
candy, etc., without limits.  He also eats a variety of other foods along with <br/>
all the junk.  Basically, since I stopped worrying about what the kids eat, <br/>
there has become nothing to worry about.<br/>
<br/>
Try to let go. Many pediatricians will tell you that kids don&#39;t generally eat <br/>
a balanced diet each day but take in a balanced diet each month.  That is <br/>
true for my children as they sometimes eat a whole bag of carrots and then don&#39;t <br/>
eat another carrot for a week or they eat a pound of steak and have no meat <br/>
for a while.  It does work out. Since you&#39;re kids are so young, you still have a <br/>
lot of control about what foods you provide and bring into the home.  Find <br/>
stuff they love that is healthy and keep it available.  My kids have been eating <br/>
watermelon and plums for weeks and can&#39;t get enough of them.  We buy mostly <br/>
organic, whole foods but there are M &M&#39;s and Pringles in our cupboards as <br/>
well.  Let your kids add some items to your grocery list and see how their <br/>
requests change over time as you surrender control.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, grazing is a much healthier way to eat than cleaning your plate at each <br/>
sitting.  Take it from my strong, lean children who consume food all day and <br/>
their chunky parents who eat three square meals.<br/>
<br/>
We adults have a lot to learn and we have been learning a lot by listening to <br/>
our kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1215166804">I have to agree here.  You can&#39;t look at her as &quot;tiny.&quot;  She&#39;s the right <br/>
size for her genes.  My boys are *much* smaller than your girl.  They <br/>
are both only 3% for height and weight.  My Ped isn&#39;t worried about it, <br/>
and I&#39;m not either (well, a little only because they&#39;re short, but <br/>
there&#39;s nothing I can do about it).  They stay on their 3% curve and are <br/>
happy and healthy little boys, and they eat what they want, when they <br/>
want, including candy.  Some days, especially when it&#39;s hot (like NOW), <br/>
they eat lots and lots of popsicles and not a lot of food, but that&#39;s <br/>
what their bodies want.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-963990892">Hello,  <br/>
  Just a few thoughts that emerged yesterday as I was sorting legos for my son.  I was listening to one of my favorite albums (Amplified Heart by Everything But The Girl) two little ones were napping, my dd 9 was drawing and ds 7 was keeping me company during my 20 minute cleanup before heading off to a july 4 barbecue at the neighbor&#39;s house.  The lyrics resonated with me, as I and my husband grow closer to unschooling in all aspects of our lives.  <br/>
  &quot;If you lose your faith,babe, you can have mine, and if you&#39;re lost, I&#39;m right behind, cause we walk the same line.&quot;  <br/>
  I have grown so much in the last year in really believing that we are our kids&#39; partners and that we are here to help them when they fall.  We are all on the same journey together. There is so much less pressure when I am not the one in control, but feel like we are working together, lending out faith to one another when it&#39;s needed.<br/>
  Thanks to everyone on this list for helping me to listen and see in a different way.  I enjoy so much reading and learning and striving to do better every day.<br/>
  Peace, <br/>
  Beth  <br/>

I&#39;ve known since DS was born (he&#39;s 8 now) that he didn&#39;t seem to eat <br/>
on a 24 hr day. It was more like 36 hours. It&#39;s gotten a little <br/>
closer to 24 hr days as he&#39;s gotten older but he still cycles around <br/>
with some days having lots of morning food and other days lots of <br/>
afternoon food and then evening foods another day. By giving him the <br/>
freedom to eat when he wants and what he wants, he can eat as his <br/>
body needs rather than by the clock on the wall the way us grownups <br/>
have been trained - &quot;it&#39;s 6 pm, time to eat&quot; whether we really feel <br/>
a need for food or not. And, in freeing him to eat as he needs, we <br/>
have freed ourselves as well and are eating better and more <br/>
consciously.<br/>
