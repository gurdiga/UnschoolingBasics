<div id="ygrps-yiv-1446166303">Ok, so today I faced my first bout of &quot;why aren&#39;t you planning to send them<br/>
to school, they&#39;ll miss mixing with other kids&quot; etc from a friend.  A very<br/>
well-meaning one, and to be honest, I was kind of looking forward to meeting<br/>
up with her as I knew she&#39;d have something to say on it!<br/>
<br/>
I agree with all the positive stuff I hear about unschooling and I&#39;m sure I<br/>
think it&#39;s a good idea, but my answers to my friend were a bit rubbish!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not asking anyone to tell me what I think, :) but do you have any<br/>
practised, quick answers to the same old questions?  I don&#39;t want to give a<br/>
lecture to my friends, but I think I sounded a bit lame!<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-484758287">Depending on the person, you can answer it with a bit of humor. &quot;I said I plan on homeschooling, not locking them in a closet.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Seriously, when I get those kinds of questions, I tell people about the playgroups and homeschooling groups that we belong to. The opportunities for homeschooled/unschooled kids to make friends/socialize are limitless.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>How about &quot;Right now this is working for us. When it stops working  <br/>
then we&#39;ll try something else.&quot; That way they don&#39;t see it as a  <br/>
forever thing but something  that will soon show you how foolish it is  <br/>
and you can do things the &quot;right&quot; way ;-)<br/>
<br/>
You also might start thinking in terms of not how you&#39;ll be able to do  <br/>
what schools do but how school is an artificial way of kids trying to  <br/>
do what they learned through real life. The socialization at school is  <br/>
a warped imitation of real socialization. At no other time in life are  <br/>
people divided up by age and expected to form friendships based on  <br/>
nothing more than birth year.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-622815453">I find the questions about mixing with other children fairly easy to answer, as we&#39;ve been involved with quite a few HE groups and there&#39;s always more going on than we can do. Where I tend to feel like I&#39;ve been completely lame is when I get the school-based interrogation - &#39;how do you do this?&#39;, &#39;how do you teach that?&#39; etc. Basically, they are asking me the &#39;wrong&#39; questions, questions that don&#39;t make sense in how we are approaching things, so I find that I am floundering when I try to answer them. Recently, I&#39;ve found it helpful to answer the questions as best I can, try to have a couple of examples of something we have done, and quickly move on to wondering why they feel the need to prove to me that their children&#39;s schools do a very fine job of providing a personalised child-led education.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-191890934">Of course you don&#39;t have to answer either.  This is my pearl of wisdom age<br/>
is bringing me...not all questions need or deserve an answer.<br/>
<br/>
However...my typical answer is that my kids AREN&#39;T going to be learning to<br/>
be bullies, bullied, or passive accomplices to the bullying that is<br/>
pervasive in public school.  The rest will work itself out.<br/>
<br/>
Mine are older than yours but they have friends on XBOX live including<br/>
Schyler&#39;s children and that is socialization I prefer.  &quot;Hanging&quot; with kids<br/>
that have common interests.  So much better than simply because of birth<br/>
year and last name don&#39;t you think?<br/>
