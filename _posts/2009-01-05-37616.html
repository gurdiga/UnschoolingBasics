<div id="ygrps-yiv-690580393">i grew up in a family where i experienced a healthy attitude towards<br/>
money. in reflection, i think the key is that my parents helped me to<br/>
get what i wanted AND they gave me money and flexibility to experiment<br/>
with spending and saving money from a fairly young age.  <br/>
<br/>
in our family, i continue to use these principles of learning about<br/>
money in a healthy way.  my kids get an allowance.  it is not tied to<br/>
chores. last year, i realized i wasn&#39;t giving the kids enough to buy<br/>
what they needed so i gave them more money this year.  <br/>
<br/>
i don&#39;t tend to keep a hard line of what we&#39;ll pay for vs. what they<br/>
need to purchase. i err on the side of buying them things because<br/>
it&#39;ll give the kids joy and pleasure.  all of us in the family think<br/>
about our purchases and discuss them together.  when we&#39;ve had a lot<br/>
of expenses, we talk as a family and we all become thrifty.<br/>
<br/>
last summer, we bought a car.  both my kids insisted on giving me<br/>
money because they knew how much we&#39;d saved for it.  they are 5 & 7<br/>
and they each contributed a dollar.  they both said that we always<br/>
helped them to get what we wanted and they wanted to help us.  i can&#39;t<br/>
put into words why, but i think that giving kids money for doing<br/>
chores, may take away from this type of dynamic.  <br/>
