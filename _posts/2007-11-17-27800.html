<div id="ygrps-yiv-698316341">I know I&#39;ve been unschooling for several years, but I still don&#39;t feel<br/>
that I&#39;m succeeding with guiding my kids without guilt.  For example,<br/>
my 4-yo.(who still nurses and co-sleeps) can give other kids a hard<br/>
time, especially if they really want to play with her.  There is this<br/>
one 3-yo. in our homeschool group (still haven&#39;t found any fellow<br/>
unschoolers in our area, though I&#39;ve posted on several sites) loves<br/>
our 4-yo.  However, our 4-yo. tells her that she doesn&#39;t want to be<br/>
friends with her and hurts the 3-yo.s feelings.  I feel caught in the<br/>
middle of respecting my 4-yo.s wishes of playing with someone else and<br/>
helping the 3-yo. feel better and guiding my 4-yo. in how to make and<br/>
keep friends.  Also, because we are the only radical unschoolers in<br/>
the group, I know the sentiment is to force sharing and playing<br/>
together, etc. and not respect an individual&#39;s needs.  <br/>
<br/>
I told the mother of the 3yo. that I struggle to balance the feelings<br/>
of others with the needs of my children.  That a 4-yo. isn&#39;t<br/>
necessarily capable of thinking of how their actions affect others. <br/>
They just want their needs met now. I remember once listening to Naomi<br/>
Aldort talk about another mother complaining that one of her son&#39;s<br/>
wasn&#39;t polite because he wouldn&#39;t read a book to her child.  Naomi<br/>
said that he was just telling her child that he wasn&#39;t interested in<br/>
reading to him and that that was o.k.  But general society says that<br/>
that is rude.  <br/>
<br/>
I also know that I still get stuck on the word &quot;respect&quot; and how do I<br/>
help my children become respectful if all the work I do modeling and<br/>
treating them with respect isn&#39;t working (my 8-yo. for the most part<br/>
has gradually become a respectful child though she still loses it on<br/>
occasion, as do I -lol)?  Or are my expectations of my 4-yo. too high?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the input!<br/>

  It may help to remember that respect and courtesy are two different things. I would like my children to be courteous to everyone they meet and I try to model that every day but repect is a completely different animal. Respect is like love, it is something you *feel* for someone else. You respect them for a reason. Respect is earned. How can you respect someone you don&#39;t know well, or someone you don&#39;t like for some reason?  Respect can not be forced any more than love can. It is a gradual thing that you begin to feel for someone after knowing them for awhile. If you don&#39;t have respect for someone isn&#39;t there a reason? You can&#39;t expect your daughter to feel the deep respect that you feel for her towards other people, but you can talk to her about courtesy and nice words and others feelings. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-306840076">We&#39;ve been officially unschooling my oldest for almost 2 weeks now.  <br/>
He&#39;s really been enjoying his time and exploring things. I&#39;m glad for <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that&#39;s come up is computer time. Initially he stayed up a <br/>
couple nights on the computer watching Transformers, etc.  I had issues <br/>
with it - (I can see you all shaking your heads ;) ) - because his <br/>
brothers would copy it and start hitting each other.  He&#39;d do the same <br/>
too.  I&#39;m all for DS exploring his interests in robots, etc., but I am <br/>
not for the coming crying to mom part.<br/>
<br/>
What I did was explain to DS the patterns of copying, and pointing out <br/>
the twins&#39; behavior. I encouraged him to pick something else.  What are <br/>
other approaches I could have used? All three of them play Transformers <br/>
with the toys they have and DS has told me of the difference between <br/>
Beast Wars and Cybertron, etc. I&#39;ve listened to him though I haven&#39;t <br/>
asked many questions about it.<br/>
<br/>
As for the staying up all night part, I didn&#39;t feel comfortable with him <br/>
up alone after I had gone to bed. Plus my own time on my computer was <br/>
limited because I let him play.  I got behind on emails, etc. So we <br/>
discussed it and I told him that I didn&#39;t feel comfortable with him <br/>
online all night. I wouldn&#39;t be able to help him if something happened, <br/>
etc. because I&#39;m asleep. Plus my time runs out and I need to use it - it <br/>
is my computer after all and brings in income for us too.  So the <br/>
computer reverts to me at 8pm every night until morning.  He can play <br/>
with it during the day.<br/>
<br/>
I told him if he has his own computer he can decide what his limits are, <br/>
within reason. (I wouldn&#39;t allow porn or breaking the law, etc. in my <br/>
house you know?)  He asked about a laptop. I said we can look into it <br/>
and at the cost, etc. See what we can work out.<br/>
<br/>
So am I missing anything here? Am I being too controlling?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1712104593"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; As for the staying up all night part, I didn&#39;t feel comfortable <br/>
 </span></blockquote>with him <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; up alone after I had gone to bed. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ok, I had to chime in on this one. We are new to unschooling also and <br/>
we decided that there will be no more bed times around these parts. <br/>
So myexpierence has been sometimes they go to sleep before me and <br/>
sometimes after me.  I did feel a little leary of them being up but I <br/>
have to trust them, what alternative is there really?  So anyway last <br/>
night I was on the computer and Thomas my 8 year old DS came in my <br/>
room and wanted some attention, so I left the computer and proceeded <br/>
to have a tickle session, and then we chilled out after a whaile and <br/>
that led into a talk and we talked for about a half hour until he <br/>
fell asleep mid-conversation. So I decided that I was sleepy too, so <br/>
I cuddled up with him. My oldest DS Jordan who is 9 checked in and <br/>
said he was going to stay up and play a game. So I went off to sleep. <br/>
I woke up this late morning to Jordan already being awake and made <br/>
himself breakfast, he fed our cats and dogs and then took them out <br/>
for a potty break. These are not his chores but just something he <br/>
knows needs to get done and he didn&#39;t wait on anyone else to get up <br/>
and care for them he took it upon himself to do it. I talked to him <br/>
this moning and I asked him if he was scared being up all by himself <br/>
or if it made him feel &quot;Like A Man&quot; he started giggling and said &quot;He <br/>
Felt Like A Man&quot;. It&#39;s funny how it&#39;s the little things that make a <br/>
difference!</div>

<br/>
up alone after I had gone to bed.-=-<br/>
<br/>
My 7 year old doesn&#39;t have a bedtime and she is a night owl (a lot like her<br/>
father), but I wasn&#39;t comfortable letting her stay up past me when her dad<br/>
wasn&#39;t home (he is usually up til 2, but works 2nd).  We worked it out<br/>
together and we figured out that she can stay up as long as she wants to,<br/>
but in order to feel comfortable (we live in a pretty bad neighborhood) I<br/>
need her to be upstairs where I am very nearby if something comes up.  We<br/>
have video games upstairs as well as books, toys, etc so this was an<br/>
acceptable arrangement for her.  We basically asked ourselves, &quot;How can we<br/>
make this happen for her&quot; and we have done that with many other issues in<br/>
the house as well.<br/>

Since we can&#39;t know what knowledge will be most needed in the future, it is<br/>
senseless to try to teach it in advance. Instead, we should try to turn out<br/>
people who love learning so much and learn so well that they will be able to<br/>
learn whatever needs to be learned<br/>

If there&#39;s a *rule* about porn and he visits a porn site, *then* what?<br/>

<br/>
Yeah---mine too. And it works. Buy had I forbade porn and drugs, do you <br/>
think he would have felt open talking to me about it?<br/>
<br/>
We haven&#39;t actually had the porn issue. Sex, yes, but not porn. <br/>
Marijuana has also been an issue. But they aren&#39;t fobidden or &quot;not <br/>
allowed.&quot; *How* could I not allow something when I&#39;m not with him 24/7?<br/>

If someone came running in our house with heroin, would we let them in? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
Huge jump. Let&#39;s start small.<br/>
<br/>
If your son were smoking weed (I keep saying &quot;pot&quot; or &quot;dope&quot; and keep <br/>
being corrected by my son. They call it weed. &lt;g&gt;), would you make him <br/>
live elsewhere?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
To me, rules are guidelines not fences... so I say I don&#39;t want things<br/>
that break the law in my house, because those things also hurt people.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes. Sometimes not. Where&#39;s the line?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
There are some laws that can be unjust - so it is a matter of one&#39;s<br/>
conviction. To me, I don&#39;t want drugs, illegal hacking, porn in my <br/>
house<br/>
because those things can be unsafe.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Illegal doesn&#39;t equal unsafe. Stupidity often does though!<br/>
<br/>
Around here, safety is our number ONE concern. I can&#39;t stop my children <br/>
from breaking the law. I can&#39;t. *I* know that, and they know that.<br/>
<br/>
We can talk about justice and consequences and potential damage. But I <br/>
can&#39;t make those decisions *for* them. I want them to be *informed*. If <br/>
I shut down discussion because it&#39;s something I simply won&#39;t allow, how <br/>
is that encouraging them to talk with me? How does that keep <br/>
communication open?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s wonderful to think that our fabulous relationships with our kids <br/>
will keep them from looking at porn or having sex or doing drugs---but <br/>
that&#39;s not always true. What our fabulous relationships DO is to <br/>
establish honesty and trust so that they *can* come to us when they <br/>
have questions about these things---and to know that, even if they DO <br/>
them, they are loved and valued and respected *in spite* of their <br/>
decisions.<br/>
<br/>
Cameron smoked weed and had sex as a young teen (he&#39;s 20 in January). <br/>
That didn&#39;t make him wrong or bad or &quot;troubled&quot;---it simply made him <br/>
Cameron. And I am honored to have been included in discussions about <br/>
these things before, during, and after the fact. Do I wish he hadn&#39;t so <br/>
early? You betcha! But that doesn&#39;t mean it wasn&#39;t right for him.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s responsible and level-headed, and I&#39;ve trusted him to make <br/>
responsible, level-headed decisions. Maybe not the one&#39;s *I* would <br/>
choose, but I think he&#39;s turned out just fine.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
 Is it wrong to have those guidelines in unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Is your &quot;guideline&quot; NO porn and NO drugs? Or is it safety and health?<br/>
<br/>
Can you try principles instead?<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have a quick link to Ben & Danielle&#39;s articles on Rules & <br/>
Principles?<br/>
