<div id="ygrps-yiv-1620896357">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Vanessa.  After 5 bad years of school for my son, and 4 <br/>
bad ones for my daughter, we are beginning our journey into <br/>
homeschooling/unschooling.  I was wondering if anyone could tell me <br/>
how to &quot;get started&quot;, and how it works.<br/>
<br/>
Both of my kids have been bullied, my son getting the worst of it.  <br/>
After this year, my husband and I felt that it was best to pull the <br/>
kids from public schools, and homeschool them, from here on out.  I <br/>
know there are verying degrees of unschooling, I guess what I would <br/>
like to know from you all, is what has worked for you, and what <br/>
hasn&#39;t.  I want the kids to learn from every day things, things they <br/>
need to survive in the world, when they get older.  <br/>
<br/>
I have watched them, and volunteered at their school since my son <br/>
was in kindergarten.  I have seen what it has done to him, and his <br/>
self esteem.  Both of my kids are good kids (I know alot of parents <br/>
say that about their kids), and they deserve to be free to learn <br/>
about the things they are interested in- no things like bees, <br/>
fiddler crabs, etc.  I was hoping to get some info, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help and time.  Hope to hear from you all soon.</div>

<br/>
That&#39;s the crux of unschooling...trust. Being free to live life and<br/>
learn whatever grabs their interest at any moment. For now, pretend<br/>
like you&#39;re on summer vacation and your job is to simply make it the<br/>
best summer vacation ever!:)<br/>
