Leslie,  &quot; Do you do any sort of meditative practice that helps you BE<br/>
in the   MOMENT?&quot;  I could really use help with this!!! But I&#39;m<br/>
clueless on  meditating, any suggestion on where to start?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
**********<br/>
 <br/>
There are others on this list that are more knowledgeable about such  <br/>
subjects, but I enjoy Eckhart Tolle.  He does not teach meditation, but  about <br/>
accepting the present moment.  He has a couple of books and CD  series.<br/>
 <br/>
Right this second, things are as they are.  You can&#39;t change that, but  you <br/>
can begin to let your mind quit trying to make it different than it is and  you <br/>
can begin to stop focusing on what is going to happen next.  When you  start <br/>
to notice what your mind&#39;s thoughts are at any given moment, it is usually  in <br/>
the past or future, rarely right now.  &quot;This should have been taken care  of <br/>
already&quot; or &quot;I need to get the laundry started.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
So my &quot;right now&quot; practice can be to just stop what I&#39;m doing and watch my  <br/>
children.  Really watch them.  It is pretty neat.  I often find  my mind <br/>
slipping in and out, other thoughts creep in.  That&#39;s OK.  I  accept that is as it <br/>
is, too.  It is incredibly peaceful and creates a  stronger connection with <br/>
your children, I think.  Even just a few moments a  day or week of this makes a <br/>
difference.<br/>
 <br/>
Here is a quote from Eckhart&#39;s new book, A New Earth.  &quot;How do  you bring <br/>
Being into the life of a busy family, into the relationship with your  child?  <br/>
The key is to give your child attention.  There are two kinds  of attention.  <br/>
One we might call form-based attention.  The other is  formless attention.  <br/>
Form-based attention is always connected in some way  with doing or evaluating.  <br/>
&#39;Have you done your homework? Eat your dinner.  Tidy up your room.  Brush your <br/>
teeth.  Do this.  Stop doing  that.  Hurry up, get ready.&#39;  <br/>
 <br/>
What&#39;s the next thing we have to do?  this question pretty much  summarizes <br/>
what family life is like in many homes.  Form-based attention is  of course <br/>
necessary and has its place, but if that&#39;s all there is in the  relationship with <br/>
your child, then the most vital dimension is missing and Being  becomes <br/>
completely obscured by doing, by &#39;the cares of the world,&#39; as Jesus puts  it.  <br/>
Formless attention is inseparable from the dimension of Being.   How does it work?<br/>
 <br/>
As you look at, listen to, touch, or help your child with this or that, you  <br/>
are alert, still, completely present, not wanting anything other than that  <br/>
moment as it is.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>
