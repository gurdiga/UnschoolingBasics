<div id="ygrps-yiv-23558875">&quot;I WANT to model generosity and serving them, but right now I&#39;m beginning to<br/>
think the end result just might be kids who just sit back and expect others<br/>
to do it all for them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
***I want to share my thoughts on this issue. The word modeling connotates<br/>
molding or shaping. I don&#39;t model cleaning joyously in my home. I clean<br/>
joyously as a way to live my life with joy. I don&#39;t clean with the intention<br/>
that my children will pick up the same attitudes and behaviors. I want them<br/>
to have the freedom to be authentic. I live the way I choose because it<br/>
feels better to clean with joy. I am not actively trying to get a result (ie<br/>
them loving cleaning).<br/>
<br/>
The same with teaching. To teach something is to assume that one person<br/>
knows and another person doesn&#39;t.<br/>
