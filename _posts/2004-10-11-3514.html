<div id="ygrps-yiv-804063953">&quot;But not since she has<br/>
discovered the use of TV as distraction. And I really think that is <br/>
part of<br/>
what we have to do... reinstate those limits on TV. Last night as we<br/>
prepared thanksgiving dinner and all the adults were busy, she wanted<br/>
someone to play with her. So I suggested she watch a show (30 <br/>
minutes) while<br/>
she wait for dinner and she said, no that is too boring.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m confused Sherri.<br/>
You say you need to reinstate limits when she isn&#39;t even that <br/>
interested in it anyway? How are limits going to help?<br/>
<br/>
I think the biggest shift right now is in how you see her. I get the <br/>
feeling that your embarrassment over how she&#39;s acted some of the <br/>
time (in front of family..am I right?) has caused you to see her <br/>
as &quot;less than&quot;. You used words like obnoxious, rude etc....which <br/>
tells me a lot.<br/>
She knows you feel angst towards her. If her Mum doesn&#39;t see her as <br/>
perfect, whole and incredible at each moment, she IS going to react <br/>
badly. I know how frustrating it can be, believe me...I have a very <br/>
intense child that makes me want to run up the street screaming some <br/>
days. But I remember that whatever he is doing to make us nuts, is a <br/>
signal of some kind. <br/>
When a child is acting in ways that aren&#39;t appropriate, and coaching <br/>
isn&#39;t working, we need to remember that they truly WANT to please <br/>
the adults in their lives and try to figure the reasons behind the <br/>
behavior.<br/>
<br/>
A Mom that is too tired to get up and fix food (even after saying <br/>
she&#39;s tired) isn&#39;t common for her probably! I would hope that <br/>
normally, a four year old changing their minds wouldn&#39;t be seen as <br/>
contrary, but normal four year old behavior. You&#39;re not normally <br/>
hugely pregnant...this is different for her, and NOT easy. Try to <br/>
understand that however hard the pregnancy is for you, it&#39;s harder <br/>
for her in many ways because she doesn&#39;t have maturity and <br/>
experience on her side. An extra dose of understanding for her <br/>
typical four year old behavior will go a long ways right now.<br/>
<br/>
Try to watch the phrases you use when seeing her act up. Drop words <br/>
like &quot;rude/obnoxious&quot; etc... and see a child that is frustrated, <br/>
lost, unable to cope etc...<br/>
If she knows that she SHINES (to borrow AnneO&#39;s term) in your eyes, <br/>
it will help her cope. Her life is changing in big ways. Having a <br/>
Mum that&#39;s too tired to do a lot of things right now is hard on her.<br/>
<br/>
This is a hard time for you too...but she&#39;s only little once. Keep <br/>
treading gently. Reinstating limits and punishment are not the <br/>
answers...that will only do more damage.<br/>

I don&#39;t know about you...but when i spend a day with my mom and/or sister<br/>
(both of whom i love dearly) my 6yo dd is &quot;petulant, demanding, overbearing,<br/>
rude, mouthy, obnoxious, inpatient and &#39;challenging&#39; to be around.  My mom<br/>
and sis aren&#39;t accepting of the way i respond to my kids and as such i feel<br/>
a certain amount of self-consciousness when with them.  I think of my dd as<br/>
really challenging me to stay true to her (or my own ideals) rather than<br/>
bend to the expectations of my mom and sis.  btw...both mom and sis really<br/>
really really appreciate my older dd, now 11, who, in their opinion,was just<br/>
as &quot;petulant, demanding, overbearing, rude, mouthy, obnoxious, inpatient and<br/>
&#39;challenging&#39; to be around when she was younger.<br/>
