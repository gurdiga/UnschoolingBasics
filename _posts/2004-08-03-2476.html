<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hanging around strict school-at-homers (doh!) and looking at curriculum  <br/>
catalogues. Using school-think and school-speak. Thinking that one kind of  <br/>
learning (academic) is more important than all other kinds. It ALL counts!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Kelly,<br/>
 I love this!!!  To see it in print really hits home.Hanging around with<br/>
strict homeschoolers is a biggy for me.Especially if we have had a difficult<br/>
week and I am feeling like &quot;what are we learning?&quot;<br/>
 Next is a curriculum magazine.....always seems to be one item that <br/>
grabs my attention. I imagine what would end it all though is to ask the<br/>
kids &quot;does this look interesting?&quot;LOL<br/>
  Being with other homeschoolers gives my kids time out to play.Most of our<br/>
friends are relaxed but there does get to be a point where the topic goes to<br/>
&quot;too much tv. or video games&quot; etc and I feel out of place. We were very<br/>
strict on it and have begun to lighten up and the feeling I get from the<br/>
discussion is.....it&#39;s not being a responsible parent to allow all those<br/>
freedoms.<br/>
 Depending on how I am feeling I can either shrug it off or begin to<br/>
question myself.Not fun.Does this happen to anyone here and if so what do<br/>
you do?<br/>

 <br/>
&quot;Depending on how I&#39;m feeling&quot;----well then I wouldn&#39;t even GO if I were  <br/>
feeling vulnerable.<br/>
 <br/>
But, then again, now I just don&#39;t go! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Well, I went for months and months. Mostly I spent my time fielding  <br/>
unschooling questions form a bunch of school-at-homers (doh!)----they always  wanted <br/>
to know what *my* kids were doing. (Nobody ever asked *them* what their  kids <br/>
were doing! &lt;G&gt;)<br/>
 <br/>
After a while, Duncan had made friends with a couple of kids, so we just  <br/>
started asking *them* to go to the park with us. <br/>
 <br/>
Park days were a great way to meet more people, but I found that none of us  <br/>
enjoyed them after a year of the same ol&#39;-same ol&#39;. The moms were mean, the <br/>
kids  were mean (but not as mean as the schooled kids that would show up some <br/>
days).  We&#39;re happier just inviting one other family at a time to do a park day <br/>
now. But  we now have a base to chose from. Park days are a GREAT way to meet <br/>
other  homeschooling families and decide which ones to spend more time with.<br/>
 <br/>
There are two groups: one in Greenville, SC and a NC  group----they have SO <br/>
many unschoolers and relaxed, peaceful moms that we&#39;ve  been known to crash <br/>
their park days and field trips because they&#39;re so much fun!  &lt;G&gt; I have to drive <br/>
two hours or so, but it&#39;s worth it!<br/>
 <br/>
My advice would be to put up flyers in your town----at health food stores,  <br/>
at Le Leche League meetings---you know, places that &quot;alternative types&quot; hang  <br/>
out! &lt;g&gt; Advertise a park day for unschoolers. Start a yahoo e-group like  this <br/>
one---anyone can start one---and advertise on local homeschooling e-lists  <br/>
that you are starting an unschoolers&#39; group. They&#39;ll show up! Just ask Pam  G. <br/>
and Priss and Ren---they&#39;ve all done it with huge success!  <br/>
 <br/>
There ARE unschoolers where you are; they&#39;re just scared or closeted or  <br/>
unsure---and *positive* they&#39;re the ONLY ones! DO something about it!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Yep.<br/>
I&#39;m still pinching myself, because I can NOT believe how many interesting, open minded homeschoolers there are in Pencacola. For those of you that don&#39;t know the area, it&#39;s part of the Bible belt/deep south where strict Baptists and spanking parents rule.<br/>
<br/>
The main homeschool support group is a Christian group, very intolerant of unschoolers. I really thought we&#39;d only know a couple folks that would understand, but I got online and found a couple other families besides us.<br/>
That has now grown into a group that is very busy and active (except in the summer unfortunately, when we dwindle off to just a few) with EIGHT unschooling families. Three of the unschooling families are totally RADICAL and we love hanging out together frequently.<br/>
<br/>
Ah, and then there&#39;s a couple folks up in Milton and Mobile that I expect to see this year...so we may have more radical unschoolers amongst us.:)<br/>
One of them is considering a move to P&#39;cola (hey Millie?)<br/>
<br/>
The homeschoolers that hang out with us are either fairly relaxed/eclectic or very open minded about unschooling. To each his own kinda thing. So I&#39;m really glad we started this group and my kids are thrilled to have a range of friends that don&#39;t get offended by their South Park humor and choice of games.<br/>

Thanks for sharing that!  I cannot wait for the day that we have <br/>
people around us like that.  So many people don&#39;t understand my son&#39;s <br/>
sense of humor!  It&#39;s over their heads most of the time. &lt;g&gt;  It will <br/>
be so refreshing when we actually have people around that can relate.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-965537000">Park days were a great way to meet more people, but I found that <br/>
none of us enjoyed them after a year of the same ol&#39;-same ol&#39;. The <br/>
moms were mean, the kids were mean (but not as mean as the schooled <br/>
kids that would show up some days). <br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve encountered this too.  We were part of a teen game group--the <br/>
point of the group was for teens to get together to play games, no <br/>
schoolwork allowed.  One day a mom brought her daughter&#39;s math <br/>
because she had been resisting doing it that day.  So while the <br/>
other kids played games this girl sat with her mom doing math.  At <br/>
one point the mom litterally screamed at her, &quot;you know this, why <br/>
can&#39;t you do it?&quot;.  I wanted to tell her that if she knew the girl <br/>
knew it, then why did she have to keep doing it, but I didn&#39;t know <br/>
the mom well enough to speak up.  It totally ruined the mood of that <br/>
day and my kids didn&#39;t want to go back after that.<br/>
<br/>
Then we moved and met up with another group of school-at-homers for <br/>
their outings and park days.  They had a co-op but I told them my <br/>
kids wouldn&#39;t be interested.  Since these kids knew each other since <br/>
birth they were very mean to my daughter, the new kid.  None of <br/>
those kids had ever been to school, either.  They were just mean by <br/>
nature, I guess.  We spent a half a year with this group, but after <br/>
Christmas break my kids didn&#39;t want to do things with them anymore.  <br/>
<br/>
So now we just do things alone--well not alone, I have 3 kids and 2 <br/>
grandkids so we&#39;re a group all by ourselves.  One of the reasons we <br/>
wanted to join that group was because we just moved to this area and <br/>
we didn&#39;t know what there was to do around here.  Not everything <br/>
gets advertised in the paper.  But, we&#39;re surviving without them and <br/>
being with them has given my kids a distorted view of<br/>
what &quot;homeschooled kids&quot; are like.  The unschooled kids that I met <br/>
at the conference were just SO different from the school at home <br/>
kids.  We have lots of unschoolers in my state, though, and I have <br/>
no problem travelling to meet them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1361818914">&quot;None of  those kids had ever been to school, either.  They were just mean<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Wow, this really made me think.  Since I don&#39;t tend to think that children<br/>
are mean &quot;naturally&quot; at all, but by something they learn or experience, I<br/>
wonder if it&#39;s the case that the forced structuring, whether it be school at<br/>
school or strict school at home, somehow generates this mean quality in many<br/>
children.  When I think of what it takes for a child to be &quot;mean&quot;, to<br/>
ostracize others, I wonder... could be the parents do this also, so it&#39;s<br/>
modeling.  But since Crystal noticed this difference, I also wonder if there<br/>
is something sort of inherently &quot;mean&quot; about forcing children to do what<br/>
they do not wish to do - whether they get forced at home by carrots at the<br/>
end of the rope or in some other way, they are being pushed down a path that<br/>
is not what is true to who they are and they are not in control of stopping<br/>
that.  Someone who feels &quot;oppressed&quot; in this way, I can see why they might<br/>
be &quot;mean&quot; - because what they are learning is that it&#39;s good to be the one<br/>
in control, it&#39;s good to be the one who has the carrots, and they are trying<br/>
to grab onto that any way they can.  Maybe that is yet another excellent<br/>
reason to unschool.<br/>
