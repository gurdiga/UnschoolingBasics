<div id="ygrps-yiv-1464579998">I&#39;ve been on the list a while just taking it all in thought it was about time i said hi...i&#39;ve got 2 boys, aged 4 and 1 year old.  I am not new to radical unschooling ideas but have been trying to implement them more fully in the last 4 mths.  I&#39;ve attachment parented from the begininng and radial unschooling seems a natural progeression.   I find i &#39;get it&#39; but i&#39;m still struggling with things so obviously on some level i&#39;m not &#39;getting it&#39;!!!  I dont have any probs with the usual tv, food, bedtime issues - its more how to handle the intense personality of my oldest and how to handle/see his difficult behaviours.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - thats just a little intro to say hi!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1180905792">Maybe you could tell us a little more about specifics. Writing them  <br/>
out sometimes helps clarify exactly what the problem is for you. Then  <br/>
you can get a range of creative ideas to help expand your own out of  <br/>
the box thinking.<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind any &quot;behaviors&quot; you find challenging, he is likely  <br/>
feeling even more challenged. It&#39;s hard to be small and have bug  <br/>
emotions that are difficult to express.<br/>
