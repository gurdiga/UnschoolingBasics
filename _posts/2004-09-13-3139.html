<div id="ygrps-yiv-2014012872">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
Just want to say this list is my antidote!  I come here as often as I <br/>
can for an anxiety buster...<br/>
<br/>
Well, I made it through the kindergarten registration date and the <br/>
first day of school without caving in!  My 5yo dd is home and happy.  <br/>
And today the world looks so sweet and interesting.<br/>
<br/>
But a few days ago I did have a moment of insanity after the kids and <br/>
I visited friends and saw what the little girl did in kindergarten <br/>
her first week.  Some quaint coloring pages, and writing practice on <br/>
manuscript paper.  Her name looked so neat and straight...<br/>
<br/>
You know what&#39;s coming.  Over the next few days I kept thinking how <br/>
nice it would be for Orion to write her name like that on manuscript <br/>
paper, so I asked her if she wanted to write a letter to someone to <br/>
mail (which we have done a few times before).  She sat down and <br/>
quickly made a little card, which I acknowledged, but I also <br/>
suggested that this time, we use the manscript paper instead of a <br/>
piece of colored computer paper, and send both to him.  So I wrote a <br/>
few words and sentences on a piece and told her to try to copy it to <br/>
practice writing neatly, so Grandpa can easily read it.  I informed <br/>
her that it is important to learn to write neatly so other people can <br/>
read our words.  She said she writes her own way and I said that is <br/>
fine when you write for yourself.  She proceeded to try copying the <br/>
my words, but had a really difficult time and soon became <br/>
frustrated.  I suggested she practice on a wipe-off manuscript board, <br/>
which she did.  She worked on that a long time, but by then I had <br/>
started to feel bad about the whole idea.  So when she decided she <br/>
was done I said she did not have to try it on the paper again, but <br/>
she said she wanted to.  Again, frustration.  I suggested that we <br/>
send the card she made Grandpa herself, with a picture and a nonsense <br/>
sentence.  I put it in an envelope and addressed it for her.  I told <br/>
her that from now on she can do it her own way, but suggetsed that <br/>
perhaps she&#39;d like to practice her name on the lined paper <br/>
sometimes?  She said okay, and went on her merry way.<br/>
<br/>
And I wonder how much damage I did!  Alas, I got anxious seeing her <br/>
little friend&#39;s schoolwork, and felt the need to compare.  But it was <br/>
fleeting, and I came back to my senses.  I read a few pages in the <br/>
Unschooliung Handbook and visited this list, and I think we are back <br/>
in the hammock. I don&#39;t know what I would do without my antidotes.  <br/>
Wait, yes I do.  I&#39;d be cracking the whip and we&#39;d be running a race <br/>
with the rest of the pack.<br/>
<br/>

Ah yes, the sweet seduction of neatly done schoolwork!  I&#39;ve been  there, <br/>

What I love about unschooled kids is that they will not do busy work, no  <br/>
matter how cleverly disguised.  And then I am amazed at how quickly we and  all <br/>
the other schooled kids became complete cows, doing what we were told.   After <br/>
my frustration with my attempts at &quot;doing school&quot; with my kids dies down,  I <br/>
am so proud that they stick up for themselves.  Wow.  You can&#39;t  teach that.<br/>

Funny you should use an analogy with cows...  I worked on a large <br/>
dairy farm (great fun) for a time, and had to move cows from place to <br/>
place (ie barn to milking parlor) and interestingly many of them had <br/>
to be poked, prodded or worse with a 2 x 4 to move and do what they <br/>
were told! Cows are smarter than we think!</div>
