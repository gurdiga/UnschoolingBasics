<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Hi!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Since Feb 2003, I have been posting an &quot;Unschooling Quote of the Week&quot; to <br/>
&gt; my unschooling group (www.SUNetwork.com ) and Altlearn Network <br/>
&gt; (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:AltlearnMapNetwork@yahoogroups.com">AltlearnMapNetwork@yahoogroups.com</a> ), Slowly more and more people have <br/>
&gt; wanted it that arent on my lists- and I have been sending it to them <br/>
&gt; manually.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So now I have set up a yahoo group so anyone can join and get the quotes- <br/>
&gt; if you would like to join, please do so!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here is this week&#39;s:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;...the ability to start out upon your own impulse is fundamental to the<br/>
&gt; gift of keeping going upon your own terms, not to mention the further and<br/>
&gt; more fulfilling gift of getting again all over again -- never resting upon<br/>
&gt; the oars of success or in the doldrums of disappointment, but<br/>
&gt; getting renewed and revived by some further transformation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Getting started, keeping going, getting started again -- in art and in <br/>
&gt; life,<br/>
&gt; it seems to me this is the essential rhythm not only of<br/>
&gt; achievement but of survival, the ground of convinced action, the basis of<br/>
&gt; self-esteem and the guarantee of credibility in your lives,<br/>
&gt; credibility to yourselves as well as to others.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; good one!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>
