<br/>
on the other hand having the class express how this child&#39;s <br/>

children are being robbed of their public education by teachers <br/>

public school is set up to deal with and handle children who are <br/>
pretty average who sit still and play well with other children- they <br/>

They&#39;d have to hire many nurses and/or other medical staff to assist<br/>
many children all day long if that were the case. There are no laws<br/>
that insist schools meet every need of every child. <br/>
<br/>
In fact, education laws are left to the individual states, there are<br/>
no federal laws concerning the education of children. Of course when<br/>
you tie federal money to those institutions, it&#39;s pretty easy to get<br/>
states to tow the line in regards to making schooling compulsory and<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>different approach to this...i read an article which better explained <br/>
what the teacher was trying to do and while i still feel she was very <br/>
wrong in what she did, it didn&#39;t seem quite as evil as some of the <br/>
original articles i read painted her out to be. <br/>
<br/>
the thing here is...you&#39;re talking a 5 yr old...her intentions to <br/>
have the child in question understand how his behavior affects the <br/>
rest of the class were very developmentally INappropriate...at that <br/>
age, they are just not going to get that out of it. a &quot;normal&quot; 5yr <br/>
old wouldn&#39;t be able to understand fully how his behavior affects <br/>
others...much less a special needs 5 yr old.<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;m guessing the teacher was at whit&#39;s end dealing with a child who&#39;s <br/>
behavior was something she wasn&#39;t trained to deal with. the article i <br/>
read said that this day this happened he had already been sent twice <br/>
to the principle&#39;s office for extremely distruptive class behavior. <br/>
i&#39;m guessing she was at the end of her rope that day and just didn&#39;t <br/>
know how to deal with him and sadly the outcome was so completely <br/>
inappropriate. i certainly have my moments like that with my own <br/>
children...i cannot imagine having to deal with the sort of things <br/>
public school teachers have to deal with on a daily basis and with so <br/>
many more children of such different abilities and needs and <br/>
behaviors.<br/>
<br/>
i don&#39;t know that she deserves to be fired...from what i&#39;ve read, <br/>
sounds like she needs to have some special training on what&#39;s <br/>
developmenatally appropriate for the age she&#39;s dealing with and <br/>
especailly some training on how to handle a child with possible <br/>
aspergers. either way, she was wrong, but i don&#39;t think she was as <br/>
evil as the media and the mom are painting her out to be. but i know <br/>
i would probably react the same way the mom is...mama bear and all.<br/>
<br/>
yet another reason to homeschool. this sort of garbage isn&#39;t uncommon <br/>
and the schools are ill equipped to deal with children in general, <br/>
much less special needs children. sure they SHOULD be, but they <br/>
aren&#39;t.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>how do you think this could possibly happen- you have maybe 30 kids <br/>
in a class and 5-7 may have &quot;behavioral&quot; issues- one might be blind- <br/>
3 might not speak the language and 2 might be so ahead they are <br/>
bored and some more are so behind they have no clue- the average <br/>
ones wonder what they are supposed to be doing- NOBODY can get any <br/>
education in that enviroment- babysitting maybe- but not much more<br/>
<br/>
how would a school meet those issues and teach the cild anything<br/>
<br/>
schools are NOT set up to meet needs they are there to take care of <br/>
a certain child with certain characteristics- average- <br/>
<br/>
it would be NICE for them to be somehow able to meet all needs but <br/>
it is just not possible<br/>
<br/>
I took my 5th grader out of school because he could not read and <br/>
write and the school had NO ability to help him with what HE needs <br/>
and school is set up to teach kids to read and write- but not my <br/>
child who would have been a late reader writer and did not FIT IN<br/>
<br/>
kids do not FIT the mold for a million reasons and in reality there <br/>
is NO way a school system can take care of all those needs which is <br/>
why the right to homeschool your child is so important<br/>

<br/>
  how do you think this could possibly happen- you have maybe 30 kids <br/>
  in a class and 5-7 may have &quot;behavioral&quot; issues- one might be blind- <br/>
  3 might not speak the language and 2 might be so ahead they are <br/>
  bored and some more are so behind they have no clue- the average <br/>
  ones wonder what they are supposed to be doing- NOBODY can get any <br/>
  education in that enviroment- babysitting maybe- but not much more<br/>
<br/>
  how would a school meet those issues and teach the cild anything<br/>
<br/>
  schools are NOT set up to meet needs they are there to take care of <br/>
  a certain child with certain characteristics- average- <br/>
<br/>
  it would be NICE for them to be somehow able to meet all needs but <br/>
  it is just not possible<br/>
<br/>
  I took my 5th grader out of school because he could not read and <br/>
  write and the school had NO ability to help him with what HE needs <br/>
  and school is set up to teach kids to read and write- but not my <br/>
  child who would have been a late reader writer and did not FIT IN<br/>
<br/>
  kids do not FIT the mold for a million reasons and in reality there <br/>
  is NO way a school system can take care of all those needs which is <br/>
  why the right to homeschool your child is so important<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
  Schools <br/>
  &gt; are not supposed to be &quot;set up&quot; to meet only the needs of kids who <br/>
  &gt; learn and behave well. It&#39;s every child&#39;s right to get a free and <br/>
  &gt; appropriate education, that&#39;s the law.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Unfortunately, I have personal experience with parents, teachers, <br/>
  and <br/>
  &gt; administrators who feel the same way you do. That because my <br/>
  child <br/>
  &gt; is different, they don&#39;t want him there. I took him out for his <br/>
  own <br/>
  &gt; benefit, not theirs. But the world sure would be a better place <br/>
  if <br/>
  &gt; people could be more compassionate, understanding and <br/>
  nonjudgemental.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; I hope you and your kids never have to go through the difficulties <br/>
  &gt; that my sweet boy has. dory<br/>

  just <br/>
  &gt; &gt; how to do it-<br/>
  &gt; &gt; <br/>
  &gt; &gt; on the one hand it was not in any way appropriate to &quot;vote&quot; on <br/>
  &gt; &gt; removing a child from the classroom- clearly that part was wrong<br/>
  &gt; &gt; <br/>
  &gt; &gt; on the other hand having the class express how this child&#39;s <br/>
  &gt; &gt; behaviors were effecting them I think is SORT OF ok. How many <br/>
  &gt; &gt; children are being robbed of their public education by teachers <br/>
  &gt; &gt; dealing with differing special needs and behavior issues<br/>
  &gt; &gt; <br/>
  &gt; &gt; public school is set up to deal with and handle children who are <br/>
  &gt; &gt; pretty average who sit still and play well with other children- <br/>
  &gt; they <br/>
  &gt; &gt; are not set up to handle 30 different acedemic-emotional-<br/>
  &gt; &gt; psychological-phyisical and whatever else challenges- that come <br/>
  &gt; with <br/>
  &gt; &gt; each child <br/>
  &gt; &gt; <br/>
  &gt; &gt; Why people think schools are warm and fuzzy places is beyond me- <br/>
  &gt; &gt; humiliation has been the main course there FOREVER- if you do <br/>
  not <br/>
  &gt; &gt; fit in you are picked on and humiliated- I guess that is why I <br/>
  have <br/>
  &gt; &gt; issues with &quot;mainstreaming&quot; do parents really think kids let <br/>
  alone <br/>
  &gt; &gt; adults are &quot;nice and fair and kind&quot;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; <br/>
  &gt; &gt; what this has to do with unschooling is escaping me<br/>

No Child Left Behind).<br/>
<br/>
It mandates that all children will be provided with an appropriate  <br/>

&quot;natural setting&quot; - which means local school, in a regular classroom,  <br/>
if at all possible.<br/>

So, indeed, special needs kids have a legal right to be there and to  <br/>

education provided to all other students.<br/>
<br/>
MANY people feel driven into homeschooling, not by their own choice,  <br/>
but because the schools don&#39;t meet their kids&#39; needs. But, many others  <br/>
spend their children&#39;s entire childhoods trying to get services.  <br/>
Schools don&#39;t often willingly abide by the full scope of IDEA,  <br/>
obviously. Parents sometimes spend thousands of dollars in legal fees  <br/>
fighting for the services that IDEA mandates - it is an entire  <br/>
specialty of the legal profession, these days. And the parents are  <br/>
often unsuccessful - the schools have experience and time on their  <br/>
side. Kids grow up while parents are fighting for those services.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-172828989">That makes a lot of sense.  It doesn&#39;t matter whether <br/>
someone has been diagnosed or not, they may or may <br/>
not get their needs met, that&#39;s the risk of pub school. <br/>
<br/>
I included a link to a website that had an address & <br/>
email to send support to Alex & his family.  I was <br/>
hoping folks might be moved to send support his way. I<br/>
envision our letter reaching them, which will explain that <br/>
Natalie can behave in all kidns of ways that might<br/>
irritate a teacher or classroom because of it&#39;s conditions, <br/>
yet she gets to relish her childhood and grow up free.  <br/>
I&#39;m visualizing the parents leaving school based on <br/>
the flood of support we provide!  Probably just a pipe <br/>
dream, huh? <br/>
<br/>
Natalie & I chatted about this, she DID comment, <br/>
immediately, that she understood the teacher&#39;s goal of <br/>
helping Alex see how his behavior impacts others.  <br/>
<br/>
I think she recognizes it because we do this in our home. I<br/>
will say, &quot;when you scream it hurts my ears&quot; or <br/>
something.  She does the same thing to me.  It just <br/>
doesn&#39;t come across that way in the articles, that <br/>
the teacher was being very sensitive with language <br/>
choices, especially when I doubt most 5 yr olds <br/>
have learned to express how behaviors affect <br/>
them without just calling names.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, you&#39;re right, this isn&#39;t really an unschooling<br/>
topic - sorry for OT&#39;ing and I hope this doesn&#39;t bring <br/>
anyone down!  I hope the boy gets some extra support<br/>
from this discussion, though!<br/>

<br/>
That wasn&#39;t the point. Everyone has a right to an education....but I<br/>
don&#39;t believe we have the right to expect a governmental institution<br/>
to meet the needs of every individual. To expect that is to give up<br/>
personal freedom! The very essence of unschooling is to quit depending<br/>
on others for &quot;education&quot; or any such thing and do it for yourself.<br/>
<br/>
A child with very specific medical needs should have help with that. I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t want to trust a school to provide that nor expect them to<br/>
meet those very specific needs. Those things we tend to think we have<br/>
&quot;rights&quot; about are usually things that society gives up a lot of<br/>
personal freedom in order to attain.<br/>
<br/>
What if people quit trying to extract support from the government and<br/>
spent their time and energy just DOING what it is they need? Better<br/>
spent energy in my opinion.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>They are expected to do so - and they have to pay for aides if they  <br/>
are needed. My sister has such kids in her elementary school  <br/>
classroom. They sometimes come with personal aides to handle medical  <br/>
stuff - usually paid for by county services. The school district pays  <br/>
for some of the aides. She DOES have to do things one would expect  <br/>
only medical professionals would ever have to do, though. The  <br/>
elementary school where she teaches is the school where all the kids  <br/>
with orthopedic disabilities go, because they have lots of special  <br/>
equipment there. These kids come with lots of other issues, as well,  <br/>
though. She has blind children, children with cerebral palsy, children  <br/>
who are paraplegic and quadraplegic. She has kids who wear helmets,  <br/>
kids who have to be fed, kids who have diapers. Her kids are not in a  <br/>
regular classroom, but most of them go into regular classrooms the  <br/>
next year.<br/>
<br/>
Again, the parents typically have to fight for the services they have  <br/>
a legal right to under IDEA. Those who get an attorney and wage a  <br/>
legal battle are very frequently the ones who get the services. My  <br/>
other sister got a lawyer and sued her school district and the  <br/>
district had to pay to send her daughter to a school that had services  <br/>
that the local school district couldn&#39;t provide for her. Lots of kids  <br/>
go to private schools that are paid for by public school funds, too.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - the connection to homeschooling is that lots of people choose  <br/>
to homeschool rather than fight for services that are slow in coming  <br/>
and usually inadequate anyway. These are parents who are trying to get  <br/>
what is a &quot;legal right&quot; to have their children receive the same  <br/>
education they would have received if they didn&#39;t have a disability.  <br/>
They are usually so fixated on getting that, they don&#39;t notice what a  <br/>
crappy education it is they are fighting for. Lots of times they end  <br/>
up homeschooling sort of against their will - they give up on getting  <br/>
services and school is impossible without the services so they resort  <br/>
to homeschooling out of desperation, not out of conviction that  <br/>
homeschooling is the wonderful amazing awesome option that it is.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes unschooling is the only thing that even makes sense - the  <br/>
kids are so clearly unique that it is obvious that the parents have no  <br/>
choice but to support the child&#39;s learning in his/her own way.<br/>

better off - lots of times the parents have fought so hard for those  <br/>
services that they feel they have to stick with school even when it  <br/>
becomes obvious that it is STILL not a good place for that child.<br/>
<br/>
The underlying primary purpose of the special ed classroom, at least  <br/>
in elementary school, is always to get the child prepared to be  <br/>
mainstreamed, no matter the extent of medical or developmental/mental  <br/>
disability. Unschooling would allow these families to focus on what  <br/>
really matters - not being able to function, minimally, in a  <br/>
classroom, but being able to function in real life in a meaningful way.<br/>

That&#39;s what I have a really hard time understanding. All the energy it<br/>
takes to fight vs. embracing a life that truly meets the child&#39;s needs. <br/>
I guess feeling like one is entitled to a government program is part<br/>
of what our society is based upon...but something I just don&#39;t<br/>

Now getting entrances and public buildings/walkways to meet more<br/>
needs? THAT makes sense to me. Trying to get my Mum around in a<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1683256421">I understand that IDEA does not require that states abide by all of its<br/>
provisions, but only that they provide certain minimum standards or<br/>
accomodations.  And, it also has a laundry list of disabilities covered, but<br/>
some are not.  Pam, is that your understanding, too?<br/>
<br/>
When my son was 4, his preschool teacher called me because he had crawled<br/>
into the corner, curled up in the fetal position and lashed out at anyone<br/>
who came near him (this was not the first time).  We had him evaluated, and<br/>
he was diagnosed with Sensory Integration Disorder.  Because of his sensory<br/>
issues, he could not abide the noise and frentic activity of a traditional<br/>
classroom.  Yet, our local school system informed us that SI was not one of<br/>
the covered disabilities, and they were not required to provide him any<br/>
special education services at all.  According to our occupational therapist,<br/>
not one SI child had been successful in convincing the district otherwise<br/>
and that remains true to this day, although they do provide early<br/>
intervention services to infants, toddlers and preschoolers with sensory<br/>
issues.  Go figure.  On the other hand, a school district just 10 miles away<br/>
provided special education services to SI children.<br/>
<br/>
Imagine what a disruption my child would have been in a traditional<br/>
classroom.  We felt we had no choice but to keep him home and start<br/>
homeschooling, at least for the short time.  That was more than 10 years<br/>
ago, and we&#39;ve been happily unschooling since.  He had years of occupational<br/>
therapy (on our dime -- and not covered by insurance) and matured very<br/>
nicely.<br/>
<br/>
But what if I had put in school anyway?  My God, I shutter to think what<br/>
would have happened to him.<br/>

&gt; When it comes to children with disabilities, IDEA (The Individuals<br/>
&gt; with Disabilities Education Act) applies to states and local districts<br/>
&gt; whether or not they accept funding from the federal government (unlike<br/>
&gt; No Child Left Behind).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It mandates that all children will be provided with an appropriate<br/>
&gt; education in the least restrictive environment possible - in the most<br/>
&gt; &quot;natural setting&quot; - which means local school, in a regular classroom,<br/>
&gt; if at all possible.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, indeed, special needs kids have a legal right to be there and to<br/>
&gt; receive all services that are needed to allow them to receive the same<br/>
&gt; education provided to all other students.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; MANY people feel driven into homeschooling, not by their own choice,<br/>
&gt; but because the schools don&#39;t meet their kids&#39; needs. But, many others<br/>
&gt; spend their children&#39;s entire childhoods trying to get services.<br/>
&gt; Schools don&#39;t often willingly abide by the full scope of IDEA,<br/>
&gt; obviously. Parents sometimes spend thousands of dollars in legal fees<br/>
&gt; fighting for the services that IDEA mandates - it is an entire<br/>
&gt; specialty of the legal profession, these days. And the parents are<br/>
&gt; often unsuccessful - the schools have experience and time on their<br/>
&gt; side. Kids grow up while parents are fighting for those services.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I totally agree with what Pam wrote. Kids who get services are not <br/>
necessarily better off. Our son was evaluated as developmentally <br/>
delayed by 2 years in nearly every area measured. He spent 2+ years <br/>
in Special Education pre-K classrooms and 1 year in Kindergarten. He <br/>
received Speech, Physical, and Occupational Therapy from the school, <br/>
and also outside Speech and Physical Therapy.  We struggled every <br/>
year to get Individual Education Plans that made sense - because the <br/>
therapists would set goals that he could already achieve.... (Gosh, <br/>
it sure is easy to show progress/success that way.) When he went to <br/>
Kindergarten (mainstream) he had an Inclusion Teacher (separate from <br/>
the K teacher) who was dedicated to help certain kids in the <br/>
classroom and he had accomodations for tests. Even so, Kindergarten <br/>
was a yukky experience. He could not keep pace, and so he frequently <br/>
brought class work to finish at home, in addition to homework. <br/>
Homework was an hour or more of struggle everyday. He also frequently <br/>
brought home negative behavioral marks, which were usually poorly <br/>
explained by the teacher. I actually keep a copy of the &quot;classroom <br/>
rules&quot; on my nightstand in case my resolve to unschool ever weakens <br/>
&lt;g&gt;. <br/>
<br/>
I honestly believe that he would have been better served if he had <br/>
been home those 3+ years. In hindsight, I regret the choice we made. <br/>
However, this experience did lead us to homeshooling, which led us to <br/>
unschooling. That is a positive outcome. I trust that he will recover <br/>
some of what he lost in school because he is young (7). <br/>
<br/>
My observation is that services for kids, whether through the school <br/>
or privately paid, are not always high quality. And, you have much <br/>
less influence with school-affiliated service providers than you do <br/>
with private providers. I also believe that parents can provide many <br/>
of the same learning opportunities that therapists provide. <br/>
Therapists may be specialists, but that does not make their skills <br/>
unattainable to someone motivated to help their own child. <br/>

attached to various kinds of medical equipment - lots and lots of  <br/>
other paraphernalia. No aide. It is just too much for the blind child  <br/>

the time. So my sister is fighting to get an aide in there to be with  <br/>
the child. There are other kids who could use aides, too, but she  <br/>
knows she&#39;ll only be able to get one, so that&#39;s the one she&#39;s &quot;going  <br/>
