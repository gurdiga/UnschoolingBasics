 </span></blockquote>***Jan, we have fostered several litters of kittens.  We have enjoyed<br/>
all of them but we really love animals.  The worst problem we ever had<br/>
was the last litter in which two kittens died at birth and the rest<br/>
got sick when they were 7 wks.  It was hard on us.  We kept wondering<br/>
what we did wrong but the shelter kept reassuring us that it happens.<br/>
 The other litters went smoothly.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t think of anything I wish they&#39;d told me before I decided to do<br/>
it.  It was fun to have a bunch of kittens in the house.  It was<br/>
wonderful to watch them be born and transform from &quot;little slobby<br/>
things&quot; (as my dd calls them) into cute little kittens with their own<br/>
personalities.  A lot of people warned me that we would have a hard<br/>
time sending them back, but that was never a problem.  I made sure<br/>
that the kids knew that it was only temporary and that it simply<br/>
wasn&#39;t an option to keep them (the kittens officially belong to the<br/>
shelter, they were never &quot;ours&quot;).  If anything, I was the one who was<br/>
the saddest to see them go just because I was the one who mothered<br/>
them the most and it was hard for me to let my babies go.<br/>
<br/>
A good set up is probably the most important part of the process. <br/>
Mama kitty will want to find a place that is quiet and secluded.  Old<br/>
sheets and boxes help. The mamas we had were pretty self-sufficient<br/>
and often picked their own place despite my &quot;perfect setup&quot; somewhere<br/>
else. Many litter boxes spread around the house are useful when the<br/>
kittens get a little older and start roaming around.  Kittens do have<br/>
&quot;accidents&quot;.  I wouldn&#39;t do it if you have rough children or other<br/>
animals that will threaten the kittens.  (we have lots of other<br/>
animals but none that cared about the kittens) The shelter made it<br/>
clear that part of our job was to socialize the kittens so that they<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be wild, so lots of gentle handling was encouraged.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, for us, it has been a very positive experience.  And the<br/>
shelter has just been thrilled that we do this for them, as if it is<br/>
some huge sacrifice.  For our part, we can&#39;t believe that we are so<br/>
lucky to be able to experience the joy of kittens for 8 weeks without<br/>
any vet bills, or worries about finding homes for them!  It has been a<br/>
win-win.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If they&#39;re still with their mother, you&#39;ll find out that they aren&#39;t  <br/>
as clean as adult cats ;-) While they will use the litter box they  <br/>
aren&#39;t good at covering and will frequently step in it as they try  <br/>
various techniques for covering and they&#39;ll track it out into the room.<br/>
<br/>
They have needle sharp claws and teeth and they will launch  <br/>
themselves at your legs. It&#39;s like having cactuses thrown at you  <br/>
several times a day. Here&#39;s a math question: If you have five kittens  <br/>
and they each throw themselves at you five times a day and the  <br/>
process keeps up for three weeks, how many cactuses have you been hit  <br/>
with total? ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I thought it would be hard to let them go, but after all that you&#39;re  <br/>
ready to be cactus and poop free ;-)<br/>
<br/>
They need PLENTY of attention! We usually kept our kittens in a spare  <br/>
bedroom, going in to see them several times per day for play time and  <br/>
feeding (essentially every time we went in there their plates were  <br/>
empty!). Or if they&#39;re really small and have no mother, we&#39;d give  <br/>
them KMR (Kitten Milk Replacement) through eye-droppers. But when  <br/>
they were a few weeks old, they got too big for the room and we let  <br/>
them run around the house. They&#39;d fly around like they&#39;d been shot  <br/>
from a cannon for ten, twenty minutes and then crash in one big  <br/>
kitten blob anywhere soft. :-)<br/>

We foster kittens at home, but my situation is slightly different than most foster homes, since I work at the shelter, too.<br/>
Each shelter or rescue is different, so I would talk to a few of them before deciding who you want to work with first.  Find out what kinds of kittens they send into foster care - moms with litters? sick? injured? orphans you need to bottle raise (TONS of work IME)?  What are their policies on adoption?  How long does a cat stay at the shelter before they&#39;re adopted?  What is their return rate like? (unsatisfied adopters?)  What happens to those cats then?<br/>
<br/>
My shelter usually only sends moms with litters or sick kittens into foster care - we have enough space in our building that we don&#39;t need to send healthy kittens out.  Some smaller shelters or rescues may not have enough space though, so they might foster for that reason as well.<br/>
Another thing to find out is what kind of support they&#39;ll give you - can you call them with questions?  Can you take a kitten to the vet if there&#39;s something wrong?  Will they provide food, litter, toys, medicine, formula?  <br/>
<br/>
At home, little kittens need a smaller, confined space so you can keep track of them (and they can find their litter box!)  You don&#39;t want a kitten stuck behind a fridge or something.  They need lots of interaction with people (I&#39;m sure that won&#39;t be a problem!) and their health needs to be monitored closely.  It&#39;s very common for shelter kittens to come down with Upper Respiratory Infection - basically a cat cold - but it can become serious to a little one.  Keep track of all sneezing, sniffles, and such - and also appeitite, diarreah, change in activity, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Also, please be aware that sometimes kittens become very ill and even die in foster care.  I&#39;ve only had one die at my house (unexpectedly - probably distemper), but it does sometimes happen, even to the best foster homes.  It&#39;s rare, but good to be aware of it... I think my dd would have a really hard time if one of our kittens died.  She was not born yet when the one I mentioned previously died.<br/>
<br/>
Right now, we&#39;ve got three crazy 7 week old kittens in Veronica&#39;s bedroom.  They climb everything, and have knocked things off shelves, brought down curtains, tipped over baskets, and stolen food off of dd&#39;s plate while she went to the bathroom!  All that said, though, my dd derives such joy from fostering.  It&#39;s truly a wonderful experience for all of us.  It&#39;s hard to send them back to the shelter... no matter how many times you say to yourself, &quot;they&#39;re not staying, they&#39;re not ours to keep, don&#39;t get attached,&quot; LOL of course you do.  And I have it easier than most people, because I can look over the applications and make sure my babies are going to a good home! <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why its important to get to know the organization, and believe in what they&#39;re doing.  At the end, it will make the separation that much easier - you can trust that they will find wonderful forever homes. <br/>
I hope that answered some of your questions.  If you have any more, let me know.<br/>
Maybe someone else will chime in here, too - I&#39;m sure everyone&#39;s foster experiences are different.<br/>

 Allyson,<br/>
Thank you for your very in depth response!  It was exactly the kind <br/>
of detail I was looking for.<br/>
<br/>
Last year we went a few times to the home of a man who fosters <br/>
kittens (MANY of them, it&#39;s a bit out of control), working with the <br/>
local shelter and recommended by a friend.  He was looking for other <br/>
people to help socialize the kittens.  It was a perfect way to start <br/>
without all the responsibility and we got a taste of what it <br/>
entails.  But for reasons unknown he doesn&#39;t want any more help and I <br/>
haven&#39;t pushed it.   He works with a local shelter (closer to him, <br/>
it&#39;s about 25 mins from us).   I was thinking of talking to our vet <br/>
(which is where we got our wonderful cat!) as they (not sure if they <br/>
still do this) have in the past had cats and kittens on &quot;display&quot; in <br/>
the waiting area for adoption (which is how we got ours).  It&#39;s <br/>
closer and we would have the support, if in fact they even do <br/>
anything like this where they need people willing to foster.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re still exploring - thanks again!  Your info helped a lot!<br/>

LOL!  I&#39;ve sat among many kittens before and know exactly what you&#39;re <br/>
talking about (not just on legs, also back, arms etc)!<br/>

<br/>
I keep thinking I&#39;d have a hard time letting them go (well, there are <br/>
always certain animals that you bond with more than others) but I can <br/>
see your point!<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for sharing Joyce!   We&#39;re not in a rush, still exploring and <br/>
want to do it only if it&#39;s a good fit and the time is right!<br/>
