<div id="ygrps-yiv-179747086">Hello everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I have enjoyed reading the posts for the last several months. I have a<br/>
question for everyone. We have been homeschooling for 3 1/2 years,<br/>
mostly school at home. We have been unschooling since April of this<br/>
year. My dd is 13. She is very independent and still in the process of<br/>
deschooling. Me too! I would like to further my education, but have<br/>
put if off in order to be available for my daughter. I would like to<br/>
get my real estate salesperson&#39;s license which means I would be in and<br/>
out of the house a lot once I get it. I am sure some of you work<br/>
outside of the home. I am curious how it works for you? Are your kids<br/>
ok with it? Do family members ask when you homeschool? Should I feel<br/>
guilty for doing this now? Should I just wait until my dd is older?<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate all of your advice in advance.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1876857386">If you can afford it, I would wait. Even independent kids need a lot <br/>
of support, and the knowledge that someone is *available* is <br/>
priceless. <br/>
<br/>
Would your dh (if you have one, I don&#39;t recall) be available for <br/>
times when you would be out? That would be a way for you to eat your <br/>
cake and have it, if you&#39;re just *itching* to get out and be a <br/>
realtor. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>George and I are both self-employed, but he is the <br/>
main &quot;breadwinner&quot; of the family. Over the years I&#39;ve cut down the <br/>
amount that I work outside the home - now its about three days a <br/>
month. Being available and supportive takes a lot more time and <br/>
energy than is obvious on the surface, and everyone in the family <br/>
notices when I&#39;m gone for a day. That&#39;s something I have a hard time <br/>
communicating to non-homeschoolers for the most part. I&#39;ve found <br/>
that I *can&#39;t* do any kind of venting about wanting to get some of <br/>
my own needs met to friends and family who have never homeschooled. <br/>
I save that for the message boards and my &quot;play dates&quot; with other <br/>
home/unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>

routine in terms of when we&#39;re more likely to be home vs out. If I <br/>

times as &quot;our homeschool time&quot;. I just don&#39;t tell them how much <br/>
Spongebob is involved in &quot;homeschooling&quot; in our house ;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My daughter is 14 and I do work full time outside the home.  I guess <br/>
if I could do anything I wanted I would be home with her most of the <br/>
time but that&#39;s not an option for us right now.  I do get the <br/>
surprized looks from people who learn we homeschool and some people <br/>
ask about when we do things.  I usually skirt around it by saying she <br/>
is old enough to be self directed and that I monitor what she does in <br/>
the evenings.  That&#39;s true enough but they probably see it in a <br/>
different way than what really happens.  In reality we talk during the <br/>
day at least once & send e-mails especially if one of us finds <br/>
something cool.  She just came back from Not Back to School Camp so <br/>
now she has friends to talk to during the day.  In the evenings we <br/>
hang out, cook, play games, go out & talk about stuff.  I&#39;ve found <br/>
some really coool lecture/discussions at a local college we want to <br/>
check out.  She&#39;s also teaching herself to play guitar.  We tried to <br/>
learn to crochet but neither one of us could figure it out from the <br/>
book so we need someone to show us.  On the weekends  she likes to <br/>
spend time with her friends, do fun stuff and work (she does child <br/>
care at church).  My mom usually has one day off during the week and <br/>
they spend time together.   I know she would be happy to have me at <br/>
home with her more but we do make it work.  Bottom line is whatever <br/>
you decide to do, don&#39;t feel guilty about it.  If it doesn&#39;t work for <br/>
your family then do something different.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-859771475">I am interested in this, too. I have always worked part-time, and <br/>
hope to continue, even though we have just started homeschooling. I <br/>
can arrange my work so I am occupied just 2-4 hours at a time, 1 or 2 <br/>
weekdays a week, then a little more on weekends. I usually work out <br/>
of my home. I&#39;m curious to hear if others think this is taking too <br/>
much from the family. My son is pretty good about keeping himself <br/>
quietly occupied while I work when dh is not home. When dh is home, <br/>
they usually go out on errands or adventures when I work.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2001707206">Hi,<br/>
we took my stepson out of school when he was 13, my<br/>
husband would often be gone during the day and I would<br/>
often be out with the little ones but he really<br/>
enjoyed the time to himself and would not have minded<br/>
at all to be alone for a good part every day. I would<br/>
say that really depends on your daughter. I would talk<br/>
to her about what you would like to do and how she<br/>
feels about it, what she would like to do in that time<br/>
etc. Is there someone she could reach/call if need be,<br/>
friends she could be with, grandparents, etc. ? Maybe<br/>
she is like my son and  would love it - maybe she<br/>
would want to come along with a book...<br/>
All the best,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I would not wait. I have a daughter now aged 15 who left school after 8th grade at age 14. I also had to work full time, and still do. Her Dad had back surgery that summer and during his &quot;recuperation&quot; he was directing the rehab of the house we now live in, so he was largely unavailable during the day also. It was not exactly easy &quot;deschooling&quot; and I felt bad for not being able to be around, and for her being &quot;left to her own devices.&quot; But in spite of the boredom and isolation she felt, she was in no way compelled to go back to school. Now, 16 months later, she has tons of friends, many of whom she met at Not Back To School Camp as well, and is very much occupied all the time with a variety of activities. So despite the situation, it was a good decision overall for us. <br/>
I have had to deal with the attitudes of people and family members but basically, I have a policy of silence on the issue. I am not out to convert anyone at this stage, so with the parent&#39;s of her conventionally schooled friends I just never mention it. I let them assume whatever they want. I am suitably vague with concerned family members. I just tell them I am &quot;keeping records and complying with state standards.&quot; <br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My son is pretty good about keeping himself <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s sort of a catch here - kids are generally pretty good at <br/>
making the best of less-than-ideal situations when &quot;enough&quot; of their <br/>
needs are being met, and that can fake us (parents) out a bit. They <br/>
*seem* to be doing just fine. <br/>
<br/>
Ray is really great about &quot;keeping himself occupied&quot; when I&#39;m out. <br/>
At the same time, though, I&#39;m not there to offer him the last <br/>
cookie, look at a cool new trick he can do, or chat about whatever <br/>
catches his interest on Runescape or Mythbusters. Those are all as <br/>
much a part of supporting his autonomy (and other needs) as making <br/>
sure he can get himself some food and find things to do on his own. <br/>
Its true that he doesn&#39;t really *need* me to be around every second <br/>
to do these things, but there&#39;s also no way of knowing when those <br/>
moments will happen. So there&#39;s a degree of juggling needs and <br/>
finding solutions that leave everyone feeling supported, not <br/>
just &quot;occupied&quot;.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Its worthwhile to think about *why* you want to keep working. Is it <br/>
the extra money? Does the work fill some of your personal needs? <br/>
Which ones? Then brainstorm if there are other ways to &quot;get&quot; the <br/>
same things *and* be more available to your kid. Sometimes we don&#39;t <br/>
see other options bc we haven&#39;t looked yet ;) <br/>
<br/>
When I first had kids it never occurred to me that I would do <br/>
anything but continue working. I had to do a lot of thinking about <br/>
my own values and needs and how those intersected with my family and <br/>
individual family members - I still have to think about those <br/>
things, too. Its not a one time decision, its a continuing process <br/>
as my kids grow and their needs evolve.<br/>
