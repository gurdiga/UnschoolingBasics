 </span></blockquote>When we moved we made a concerted effort to organize food so the boys <br/>
(6 & 7) can reach items that they enjoy for grazing. We keep grapes, <br/>
bananas, nuts, pretzels, and Kashi bars on the counter within the <br/>
boys&#39; reach. We also have apple sauce, yogurt, and cheese within <br/>
their reach on the fridge door. The boys know where to find cereal, <br/>
crackers, raisins, and marshmallows in a lower cabinet. <br/>
<br/>
About 2-3 hours after breakfast and lunch, we put out a plastic tray <br/>
of veggies: grape tomatoes, carrots, broccoli, and green peppers. <br/>
After 30 minutes or so, when grazing has stopped, I put the lid on <br/>
and refrigerate the remainders. (We bought one veggie tray from the <br/>
grocery and then replenish it ourselves with the boys&#39; favorite <br/>
veggies. The tray has lasted a long time.) <br/>
<br/>
You mentioned browning of apple slices causing distress. One solution <br/>
is to sprinkle a bit of lemon juice on a plate and then coat each cut <br/>
side of the apple with the lemon juice. This delays browning. (Or, <br/>
you can shake the apple pieces in a bag containing lemon juice if <br/>
that is easier.)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck! Lisa</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-66640339">Or, toss the apple slices with something like cinnamon that might help<br/>
mask the browning temporarily if lemon juice is not an option flavor<br/>
wise. We rarely use apple slices unless they&#39;re going to be the first<br/>
thing eaten precisely because of that issue. Maybe spend a couple hours<br/>
on a weekend and make some pocket pies (check out Alton Brown&#39;s recipe<br/>
on the food network website - it&#39;s easy and tasty and the baked in<br/>
cinnamon apples don&#39;t have quite the same issue as the fresh).<br/>
<br/>
Oh, also, one of those apple wedgers might be good - they make plastic<br/>
ones that don&#39;t cut skin readily but they core and slice apples in a<br/>
flash - maybe just have that handy and the fresh apples so the kids can<br/>
get a sliced apple at will without letting it sit out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2068948170">A trail mix of nuts, dried fruit and chocolate chips/M&Ms (even mini<br/>
marshmallows) is a handy thing (if combining things is acceptable). I<br/>
make small containers of &#39;ogre mix&#39; for travel - through some nuts,<br/>
dried fruit, chocolate chips into the container but DON&#39;T mix it or toss<br/>
it the way you would a regular trail mix. It has to have layers, ogres<br/>
have layers :-)<br/>
<br/>
Also, dipping fat pretzel rods into Nutella is yummy, PB is also good.<br/>
And if you&#39;ve got some time and want to make a really cool treat, melt<br/>
some chocolate chips in the microwave then dip the pretzel rods into it<br/>
leaving just enough space for a hand hold, place on parchment or waxed<br/>
paper and refrigerate until firm, store in zip top bag (in the fridge in<br/>
the summer heat). Even cooler - use white chocolate chips and a couple<br/>
drops of food coloring to make edible &#39;light sabers&#39; in blue, green<br/>
and/or red.<br/>

I need some ideas of what to put out for monkey platter foods. I used<br/>
to do a standard sliced apples,crackers,cheese and carrots. That<br/>
usually went over well,but my 11 yr old has started getting distressed<br/>
aabout the apples bruising if they are not eaten right away and it<br/>

these things need to be eaten quickly or refridgerated anyway, so I&#39;d<br/>
like some ideas of food that will last out longer and more variety. So<br/>
what do you all suggest?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
quesadillas---usually bean and cheese---cut into small triangles<br/>

<br/>
boiled peanuts (but that&#39;s mostly a Southern thang! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
crackers with peanut butter, nutella, hummus, babaganoush---anything <br/>
that&#39;s spreadable<br/>
<br/>
pretzels<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2025981777">LOL I did those (with DS&#39; help) for a Bible class I was teaching - just<br/>
me, DS (he was just turned 9 at the time, now he&#39;s a few short weeks shy<br/>
of 10!) and one other boy (he&#39;s 5) who thinks DS is the coolest because<br/>
he knows all about Star Wars. It was a short term sub thing because the<br/>
teacher for that group and the rest of the older kids (the class I was<br/>
usually teaching with DS in it) were going to be gone for a couple<br/>
weeks. So, I did a Star Wars themed 3 week plan - I made quick&#39;n&#39;dirty<br/>
light sabers by opening up brown paper grocery bags, rolling them up on<br/>
the bias for extra length, then wrapping that with blue (or green) duct<br/>
tape with black duct tape for the handle area. Cheap, simple, fast, AND<br/>
they don&#39;t even sting when you get hit with them, they mostly just bend<br/>
if you hit too hard. Also, I went to wikipedia and they had a list of<br/>
both the original Jedi code and the &#39;revised&#39; Jedi code that Luke<br/>
Skywalker developed when he re-built the Jedi order. What was pretty<br/>
cool was that I could (given it WAS a Bible class and all) match up each<br/>
and every one of the points (5 or 6 points) to a Bible verse or passage.<br/>
We did all sorts of cool stuff - me and my padawans :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1965642210">If you want to go toward something &quot;hors d&#39;ouvre&quot; like and spend a<br/>
couple minutes prepping, take some flour tortillas and slather with a<br/>
thin layer of cream cheese, add a couple slices of thin deli ham, then a<br/>
dill pickle slice. Roll it up tight and cut it into bite sized pieces.<br/>
YUMMY! We&#39;ve also done cream cheese, lox (smoked salmon), and avocado<br/>
but that&#39;s a bit more expensive (and avocado tends to brown when it<br/>
oxidizes). <br/>

the variety of apple).  You just let the apple slices soak in a bowl of <br/>
Sprite for a few minutes before you put them on the plate.  Lemon juice <br/>
works better, but doesn&#39;t taste as good.<br/>
