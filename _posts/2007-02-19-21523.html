<div id="ygrps-yiv-55069407">I know I mentioned a few of these a while back but here I am again with <br/>
more...<br/>
<br/>
I love this site:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.coopamerica.org/">http://www.coopamerica.org/</a><br/>
from here I clicked on the Green Festival and you can listen to last <br/>
years pod casts from the festival (.<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.greenfestivals.org/index.php)">http://www.greenfestivals.org/index.php)</a><br/>
....I just finished listening to my new favorite author David Suzuki!<br/>
<br/>
from this site I clicked on SustainLane and found an online animated <br/>
show about an average family trying to get more green...I haven&#39;t <br/>
watched it yet to see but I think it&#39;s great for kids too.  This site is <br/>
adding another feature of green product reviews but it isn&#39;t ready yet<br/>
<br/>
another great one:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.grist.org/">http://www.grist.org/</a><br/>
from here I clicked on Daily Grist and caught up on some green headlines <br/>
including Al Gore&#39;s teaming up with some celebs to have SOS (Save Our <br/>
Selves) and Live Earth concerts on 7/07/07 (uniting seven continents <br/>
with seven concerts)<br/>
<br/>
and of course:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.thegreenguide.com/">http://www.thegreenguide.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
There were some great recommendations in the magazine &quot;Natural Home&quot; for <br/>
more sites.<br/>
That&#39;s all for now folks...<br/>
