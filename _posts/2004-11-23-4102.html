<div id="ygrps-yiv-1308557768">&quot;If you have time, could you talk more about that transition, what <br/>
it looked<br/>
like? Did you have a conversation with your kids about your new <br/>
outlook or did<br/>
you just jump in and do it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We pretty much jumped in and did it. But it WAS a slower transition <br/>
for us. <br/>
We had leaned towards a relaxed/eclectic style for many years. <br/>
Having read Holt back in &#39;95/&#39;96,you&#39;d think I would have gotten it <br/>
a lot sooner! Unschooling sounded ideal, but I just hadn&#39;t made that <br/>
paradigm shift to see the learning in everything. I thought my son <br/>
needed some pushing. I did a lot of damage, but less than school <br/>
would have since he was free to explore the world for the most part.<br/>
<br/>
In early 2000, I started reading at unschooling.com and just loved <br/>
what I read. We relaxed even more, then in August of 2000, my dh and <br/>
I separated. I was pregnant with babsy #4 and decided this was my <br/>
moment to totally LET GO. We lived life. We quit worrying about <br/>
math, or writing and just lived together. I still had my chore lists <br/>
and bedtimes and tv limits, though I wasn&#39;t a nazi about it (well, <br/>
except for the tv thing).<br/>
Dh and I reconciled in Jan. of 2001, and he moved back in February. <br/>
He is a much more structured/organized person than I, so he wanted <br/>
to make some changes when he moved back in. We got Nazi-like about <br/>
some things. It was awful.<br/>
I was reading enough by then to really question the sanity of <br/>
everything we were doing and finally got to the point where I said <br/>
NO MORE. I told him that if he wanted to damage his relationship <br/>
with his children, I couldn&#39;t stop him, but I was NOT willing to be <br/>
an aid.<br/>
It took a while for me to really understand, deep down. But I just <br/>
kept struggling my way through all of it. Once in a while,I&#39;d have a <br/>
regression and gripe at the kids about too much tv or video games, <br/>
that was in 2001. But somewhere in that year, I think May or <br/>
Juneish, I quit worrying. Once we embraced ALL of life as learning, <br/>
once I realized my children were perfectly capable of making their <br/>
own decisions and that acting as their partner really worked...then, <br/>
and only then, did unschooling unfold the way I&#39;d read about.<br/>
Voila!! We&#39;d done it!:)<br/>
I was a lot slower than others here....my stubborn brain was holding <br/>
onto that which it was familiar with, school. No longer.<br/>
I am their allie now, not the enemy. No longer are there struggles <br/>
about trying to make them do things they don&#39;t want to do, our house <br/>
is more peaceful, more joyful than I could have imagined.<br/>
Unschooling was the road to healing for us.<br/>
