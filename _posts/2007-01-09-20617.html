<div id="ygrps-yiv-1406799334">My two boys have never seen a shot in their lives (thus far.)<br/>
<br/>
Our first had to be delivered in the hospital.  We never let them do anything to him.  No anything.<br/>
<br/>
Our second was born at home in water!  They were both great experiences.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the vaccinations are for natural childhood diseases.  Diseases that, if they &#39;catch&#39; them, will give them life-long immunity, unlike vaccinations.<br/>
<br/>
I can count on one hand the number of times each of them have been sick. <br/>
