<br/>
I have noticed that when I&#39;m feeling a powerful need to control other <br/>
folks it&#39;s because there&#39;s something inside me that feels out of <br/>
control.  When I shift my focus to what feels out of control inside <br/>
my own skin, EVERYONE is better off!  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I hope that helps!<br/>

Forgive yourself.  Realize that by acknowledging that you need to change, <br/>
you are making<br/>
HUGE progress!  Kind of like AA.   The first step is to admit you have a <br/>
problem : )<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Things that have helped me...<br/>
<br/>
1.  Breathe and Breathe some more.<br/>
<br/>
2   Acknowledge it out loud to the kids and rewind the event.  &quot;Gee that was <br/>
not very nice to<br/>
interrupt your game...I am sorry.&quot;  Also, I note my real &quot;agenda&quot; so to <br/>
speak<br/>
(maybe it is just too loud in the room) and ask the kids for help when <br/>
appropriate.<br/>
<br/>
3.  Find something that you CAN control and go to it...<br/>
Rearrange your spice shelf, sort and toss clothes for Goodwill, or go pull <br/>
weeds...<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there,<br/>

Where it took a resilient (and thankfully forgiving) 6ft 2in teen to make me <br/>
rethink<br/>
the illusion of control. During an argument, I sent him to his room and at <br/>
that moment I had an epiphany if sorts and I realized how absurd it all <br/>
was...</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-544890596">I had that thought. Shifting my focus in the middle of the chaos of<br/>
this morning (we were planning on going to the library so I had to get<br/>
everyone up and around, breakfast and lunch in the crockpot with kids<br/>
fighting) was near impossible. I sent dh out with the kids though, so<br/>
maybe I will be able to do that now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1299187865">I think *part* of the problem might be the following.<br/>
<br/>
Lilly and Stella are fighting again today (they were fighting<br/>
yesterday as well). <br/>
<br/>
Lilly is my 4 year old. Stella is the 3 year old that we babysit.<br/>
<br/>
Lilly doesn&#39;t want Stella around. Today. I don&#39;t know what to do on<br/>
days like this. Most of the time they play fine together. In fact,<br/>
most of the time Lilly WANTS Stella to come over to play. The last two<br/>
days though, Lilly wants &quot;alone time&quot; which really means time without<br/>
Stella. I can understand that need, but I can&#39;t just call her mom up<br/>
and say &quot;Lilly wants alone time, find another sitter for Stella<br/>
today&quot;, you know?<br/>
<br/>
I think there are more reasons that I am grumpy (like an issue with dh<br/>
that I am hoping the peacefulpartnerships group can help me out with),<br/>
but this is one of the issues.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-686405244">Hi Amanda,<br/>
   <br/>
  I can really relate to your situation.  My twin 3 year olds fight a *lot*.  They want space too which we try to give them in the evening when there&#39;s more than one adult here.  I know when there is a lot of confict between my girls (it goes in spurts for sure) I feel my old controlling self rearing its&#39; ugly head.  I want them to just stop fighting and listen to me, dammit! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;ve noticed often lately, since dh and I are also working through lots of stuff  (and so am I personally) that when there is intense emotion, shifts, etc. moving through me (and I don&#39;t have the luxury in that moment of going off by myself to sit by the water with my journal!), that is a time I have to really be conscious that the frustration and anger and impatience is all about what&#39;s going on inside me and not with my kids.  This helps immensely for me not to blow up at them.  I had some bodywork done on the weekend, and I was very aware that Monday and Tuesday I was having a very challenging time just being with their unpredictable, boisterous, power-struggling little selves.<br/>
   <br/>
  A person close to me recommended that I &quot;breathe & pray&quot; in those moments.  Yes, I am unable to find solitude (which I *love*), and self-care doesn&#39;t presently look anything like what it did pre-children, but I can always, in that moment, just breathe and pray.  I pray to the universe, I pray to my higher power, I pray to nature, I pray to my children, I pray to whatever I&#39;m moved to pray to in that moment.  And it&#39;s working.  Thank god.<br/>
   <br/>
  So for what it&#39;s worth, that&#39;s what is working for me!<br/>
   <br/>

I&#39;m sure there are many avenues to take here, but I will share what we did.<br/>
We started with our pediatrician, who didn&#39;t believe me.  But he *did* get<br/>
us a referral to a speech therapist, and *she* immediately saw that Drew was<br/>
likely Autistic.  We then went to a psychologist at our HMO would did an<br/>
assessment on Drew - just watching him play, etc.  No medical tests or<br/>
anything.  He determined Drew to be mild to moderately Autistic (he was<br/>
about 2.5 at the time).  We also went through what&#39;s called the Regional<br/>
Center in my area, which is a state run organization for people with<br/>
disabilities.  They also did an assessment (again observing how Drew played,<br/>
etc) and concurred with the psychologist&#39;s diagnosis.  I know other people<br/>
who continued the path to psychiatrists, neurologists, etc. with more<br/>
medical tests and such.  We felt comfortable with the basic diagnosis we<br/>
received and went from there.  In our case, Drew went to a therapy based<br/>
preschool for 2.5 years.  It was wonderful, even though he was gone several<br/>
hours a day.  Not sure if I would do it over again or not (i.e. if I&#39;d<br/>
choose to keep him home instead).  But honestly, at that time, I needed some<br/>
help figuring out what was what and how to help him.  And, to be<br/>
*completely* honest, I was burned out horribly and appreciated the break<br/>
during the day for a while.  In any case, that&#39;s how we did it, whether it<br/>
was the *best* way or not, it has all worked out. :-)<br/>

Hope that helps a bit.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-921125330">Drew was a very high-needs infant, who grew into a *very* high-needs<br/>
toddler.  He never seemed to be able to live comfortably in his environment,<br/>
if that makes sense.  I held him in a sling practically all day, because if<br/>
you put him down for any time at all, he would be hysterical to the point of<br/>
making himself physically ill.  He slept with us and nursed nearly nonstop<br/>
for several years.  I was told *so* many times that it was habit, I was<br/>
coddling him, etc.  But I could tell he *needed* that, he literally could<br/>
not assimilate to his world without it.  As he grew into toddlerhood and the<br/>
preschool ages, he would learn a word, say it once, then never utter it<br/>
again.  Noises, temperatures, physical sensation - all were very difficult<br/>
for him to tolerate.  Around 2 years old he completely stopped interacting<br/>
with us at all.  He wouldn&#39;t look at anyone, nor respond to anyone.  If you<br/>
were in the room, he treated you like a piece of furniture.  It was like<br/>
nothing existed in the outside world for him at that time.  That&#39;s when we<br/>
decided to seek a diagnosis. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll go on to say that today, at 8.5 years old, hardly anyone who doesn&#39;t<br/>
already known him well would know he was Autistic.  He is a wonderful,<br/>
happy, funny, intelligent, shiney boy and I&#39;m so glad we decided years ago<br/>
to bring him home where he can Shine his heart out! :-)  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391207261">*** When you feel yourself in a controlling mood, how do you let go? <br/>
**<br/>
<br/>
Luckily, I have a very confidant 2yo who just says &quot;NO!&quot; when I get <br/>
too controlling, and a 7yo who says, &quot;Why are you being so bossy?&quot;  <br/>
They really leave me with no where else to go, and they force me to <br/>
step back and analyze why this is an issue for me.  Once I have <br/>
stepped back and figured out why I feel out of control, I can usually <br/>
can usually figure out how to solve my problem without infringing on <br/>
the rights of others.  Often the solution is a good old fashioned <br/>
time out (for me, of course).  I also encourage my children to tell <br/>
me when they think I need some time alone (they usually realize I <br/>
have a problem before I do).<br/>
<br/>
My real concern is my 10yo, who is carrying around a lot of baggage <br/>
from his early years when I treated him like my personal play-doh.  I <br/>
modeled some really nasty controlling behavior for him in his early <br/>
years, and I am now seeing the results.  He feels the need to <br/>
control his siblings behavior, especially in public places.  He yells <br/>
at them and gives orders any time they are acting in a way he feels <br/>
is socially unacceptable, even after I let him know they are not <br/>
doing anything wrong.  He only does this if dad is not around, which <br/>
is probably a key detail.  He does this in a way that gives the <br/>
impression that he does not feel I can handle the situation (whatever <br/>
it may be) in a manner he deams appropriate.  I know a huge chunk of <br/>
his motivation is his knowledge that I don&#39;t handle stress very well, <br/>
and he is acting as my protector.  Basically, he is attempting to <br/>
take on too much responsiblity and act in Dad&#39;s place when Dad is not <br/>
present.  In addition, he is still running on the old operating <br/>
system, and we are having difficulty updating the programming.  Dh <br/>
and I both want to know how we can help him understand the old top-<br/>
down power hierarchy is no longer valid.  How can we help him <br/>
understand it is not his job to control anyone but himself?<br/>

Oh I was just going to do a search for such a group!  The universe was<br/>
listening!  I just sent my request to join.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
By the way, I&#39;m listening to a tape of Sandra from a L&L conference I think.<br/>
The link was posted at Always Unschooled.  It&#39;s good info.  Here&#39;s the link:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/parentingpeacefully">http://sandradodd.com/parentingpeacefully</a> <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
To listen to the tape scroll down to the bottom.  But please, please read<br/>
the page as well.  It&#39;s so helpful (at least to me it is)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
be at peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1634243667">Hi Tina-<br/>
<br/>
I have been saving this for a while, sorry to be out of sync. It takes <br/>
me a long time to get to email!<br/>
This reminds me of our home- my son who is 14 , can act this way towards <br/>
his younger sister. I don&#39;t<br/>
know that I have found any really complete solution but I just keep <br/>
listening to both their feelings and try to<br/>
meet their needs in the situation. He doesn&#39;t do this in public places, <br/>
only at home. I can see exactly<br/>
where it comes from, as he acts like his dad does in his less happy <br/>
moments. I can feel pretty helpless and am trying<br/>
just to be observant to see what I can learn about the situation. If he <br/>
is angry that she has left her belongings all<br/>
over the the living space I will acknowledge his anger and offer to <br/>
clean up a bit. If he is angry that she<br/>
is eating all the whatever I will assure him that we will get more if we <br/>
run out, or just try to get a lot of that<br/>
particular item. I try to meet his needs in general as much as possible, <br/>
which I would do anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I say things like, I know it is frustrating when she does something that <br/>
you have learned isn&#39;t a good idea for<br/>
you to do, and to see her doing something that you would no longer do, <br/>
but I don&#39;t think it helps her learn if<br/>
you try to force her- maybe you could tell her something that would <br/>
convince her it isn&#39;t a good idea.<br/>
(tonight it was eating baked potatoes completely covered in catsup with <br/>
her fingers). We talked about why<br/>
he didn&#39;t like it(it is disgusting and something she is too old to do), <br/>
and if there was a real reason to tell her to stop,<br/>
and talked about other food people eat with their fingers and that <br/>
washing hands is something to consider before eating with your fingers.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to be getting easier, I think. Really I need to be aware and <br/>
get up and go see what is going on every<br/>
single time I hear that someone is starting to get upset and stay with <br/>
it until things are resolved at least as much<br/>
as possible. Letting go of assumptions of how anyone should be acting is <br/>
helpful. Being in the moment with<br/>
them and not just feeling frustrated and giving up.<br/>
<br/>
I would appreciate any suggestions other have also.<br/>

<br/>
Dh and I are really trying to get at the heart of why ds1 is <br/>
chastizing his siblings in public.  His lack of understanding about <br/>
his siblings maturity level may have something to do with it.  He <br/>
knows why is is not a good idea to hide in the store, therefore (in <br/>
his mind) everyone should understand this concept.  However, I am <br/>
always present when these situations come up, so I would really like <br/>
to help him understand that it&#39;s not his job to convince them of <br/>
anything.  It&#39;s like he has no faith in my parenting abilities, or at <br/>
least it feels that way to me.  Some of it could be the fact that his <br/>
siblings do things that he used to get in trouble for when he was <br/>
little (roll on the floor, etc.).  I&#39;m such a different mom now than <br/>
I was when he was little, and I am a work in progress.  I don&#39;t know <br/>
that he understands this.<br/>
<br/>
A conversation is definately in order.  We need to talk about how the <br/>
little guys aren&#39;t as mature as he is, and yelling won&#39;t make them <br/>
any more mature.  I definately need to ask him why certain behaviors <br/>
bother him.  That would be a lot more illuminating than trying to <br/>
guess why he is yelling at them.<br/>
