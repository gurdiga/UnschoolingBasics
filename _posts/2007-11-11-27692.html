My 11  years old son makes the most nasty comments to people he doesn&#39;t like. <br/>
When I  have talked to him about this he says he doesn&#39;t care. He doesn&#39;t <br/>
like them so  he&#39;ll say whatever he wants to them.  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;,<br/>
 <br/>
Have you tried talking with him to find out why he dislikes them, is it  <br/>
something they do or say that he doesn&#39;t like?  Maybe then it would be  easier to <br/>
find out what his needs are and work on a way to meet his need as well  as <br/>
yours and the other person&#39;s.  It sounds like there may something  there that is <br/>
not being voiced and addressed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-549660014">I did talk to him about it again after I posted this. I talked about my need to have friends also. About how it makes me feel when he does this. We talked about alternative ways to handle the situations. He told me how difficult it is for him to be around someone he doesn&#39;t respect. I shared some examples of situations where I felt the same way and how hard it was for me and how I handled it. He apologized to me and then called his friend, whose mother he had had words with earlier in the day, and apologized to him. I think we are better on our way to understanding each other and we just need to make sure that that line of communication stays open. <br/>
Thanks for the input.<br/>
