<div id="ygrps-yiv-1690066215"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;They have t-shirts that you can get that reflect these commercials.  I love<br/>
&gt;what they say. However, the only way that I can see that you can get one of<br/>

&gt;because most of them are too harsh for my skin.<br/>
&gt;I wish they would just sell the t-shirts without hawking their products!<br/>

I love those commercials too, and don&#39;t use Dove but here&#39;s a thought.  It<br/>
sounds like the price they&#39;re asking, the added costs of the products plus<br/>
S/H is about what you&#39;d pay for a t-shirt.  Why not buy the products and<br/>
donate them to a local woman&#39;s shelter or something.  Then everyone wins.<br/>
