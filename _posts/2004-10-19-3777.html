I&#39;m a very good speller. And a grammar nazi. I cringe when I see bad  <br/>
spelling and bad grammar. It&#39;s important to ME. No one else. I know that---and I  <br/>

I won&#39;t correct your grammar or spelling or typos in this forum because  <br/>
that&#39;s not what it&#39;s designed for. This e-list is here to discuss unschooling  and <br/>
peaceful parenting. If you send me your book to edit, I&#39;ll do that happily  <br/>
and with a blue pen! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
No one should be afraid to write here beause of what others will think of  <br/>
her compositions. Here, it&#39;s more important to get your feelings and concerns up <br/>
 on the screen. And if someone who struggles with grammar and spelling is  <br/>
looking to be published, she should hire an editor (or ask a friend!  &lt;g&gt;)!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Any one have a dh that is gone for periods of time? Any advise on <br/>

<br/>
Congrats on the new one! I was just adding up how much dh has been <br/>
gone lately...5 weeks out of the last 5 months, so I&#39;m getting a <br/>
taste of it. Most of the time it&#39;s been for one week at a time, so <br/>
that&#39;s not too bad. <br/>
<br/>
Dh stocks the fridge and freezer with lots of easy to cook food--<br/>
okay, some of it is &#39;easy to defrost&#39; food! Showering has been nearly <br/>
impossible this week...<br/>
<br/>
The main mental difference for me is that instead of trying to get a <br/>
bunch of stuff done quickly while dh plays with the kids, I try to <br/>
stretch out &#39;chores&#39; so that we all enjoy them. Instead of dh picking <br/>
up the mail when he comes home, the kids and I go get it, which means <br/>
dd (1.5) takes the key and spends 15 minutes refusing to open the <br/>
mailbox. We talk to neighbors, we end up taking the mail for a little <br/>
walk, etc.<br/>
<br/>
We might make 2-3 trips to the store for a few items and take our <br/>
time, looking at fruit we&#39;re not familiar with or something.<br/>
<br/>
Ah shoot, some of you do this all the time, right? Maybe I need to <br/>
pretend dh isn&#39;t available more of the time.<br/>
<br/>
They aren&#39;t chores, they&#39;re life, so enjoy it.<br/>
<br/>
We are taking the kids on more errands as they get older. Ds (4) is <br/>
really good company. Dd is great on some outings, but gets frustrated <br/>
with others. Dh even survived taking both of them to the store last <br/>
week, poor ol&#39; introvert! They came home with a frightening amount of <br/>
candy, but that&#39;s okay.<br/>

Congratulations, Rebecca!<br/>
 <br/>
While your husband is gone, you might need to minimize &quot;have-to&#39;s&quot; and  <br/>
maximize fun and joy.  With a newborn, you are doing this already!  Is  there <br/>
someone that can help you with housework or feeding the kids?  (I  never did, but <br/>
thought I would ask!)  Is there a neighbor or a 10 YO that  might want to come <br/>
over for a few dollars to play with the older kids?<br/>
 <br/>
Try to have as many easy meals around as possible, less cooking and less  <br/>
cleanup.<br/>
 <br/>
My kids always liked to get out almost every day to do something.   Even a <br/>
ride in the car or a walk around the block gave us a change of  pace.<br/>
 <br/>
Since it is the holidays, you may need to warn the extended family that you  <br/>
will be doing just the minimum this year, and that means caring for your  <br/>
children.  You might have to say &quot;no&quot; or &quot;maybe&quot; alot.  When you have  the time <br/>
and energy to do more, you will.  If I got invitations to things,  I would say <br/>
that I didn&#39;t know if I could come, it would just depend on the  day.  Most <br/>
people understood this.<br/>
 <br/>
Consider this an adventure, not a chore.  And prepare your husband for  you <br/>
to need alot of rest when he is home, and that he might need to  take over the <br/>
care and feeding of everybody for those days.  It is as much  of an emotional <br/>
drain to do this as a physical one.  Rest up while he is  home.<br/>

Something we are still laughing about...I had REALLY wanted a water birth with this one, we had tried with the other two but wasn&#39;t able to manage it. The staff new about the water birth and had the tub all set up for me, Jason had stripped down to his boxers so he could be in the tub with me, when the next thing we knew, I was pushing he had climbed up onto the bed to hold my had and talk me through everything. After all was said and done jason noticed the resident was bright red and all flustered, he looked down and noticed that his boxers had shifted and, umm, as he put it, &quot;beans and franks, for the world to see&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
That poor resident, she had only been at the hospital for 2 months, never heard of the birthing center located in the hospital, wasn&#39;t prepared for nude men and a laboring woman screaming at her that if they tried to move me I&#39;d jump up and kick her ass. (I was on the bed sideways and she wanted me at the end of the bed with my butt hanging off the mattress, and she kept trying to pull me where she wanted me).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1872655832">On the little boy/potty issue,<br/>
we just used a plastic potty at first (kinda like the coffee can <br/>
idea) and kept it in whatever room we were in. It made a big <br/>
difference for Jacob to not have to leave the room if he was in the <br/>
middle of something, especially TV.<br/>
<br/>
Usually he just wanted to hang out naked so that made things really <br/>
easy. With winter coming, don&#39;t know how well that would work, LOL<br/>
<br/>
If he went somewhere else, we just gently cleaned it up and <br/>
said &quot;Next time you can put your pee in the potty&quot; or &quot;Oops, pee <br/>
doesn&#39;t go on the floor, let&#39;s clean up&quot; (Mother&#39;s Little Miracle&quot; <br/>
is a great spray for getting out stain/odor from potty accidents) <br/>
Very low key.<br/>
We did teach him to pee sitting down because that is how my husband <br/>
goes (at home).<br/>
<br/>
Eventually we got a &quot;Flip N Flush&quot; for the toilet and a little stool <br/>
and he got into going on the toilet pretty quick.<br/>
<br/>
Hope he makes up his mind for you soon :)<br/>

-----------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations! And welcome to world Garett.  How exciting!  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My dh has traveled frequently since we before we had kids.  Right now he<br/>
tends to be gone for three weeks and home for  1-3 weeks.  One of the<br/>
benefits of this type of work schedule is that when he is home, he is home<br/>
all day.  We get to spend a lot of time together when he is here.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t really have any advice to offer.  It&#39;s just something you get used<br/>
to.  I think that we actually talk more this way because he calls every<br/>
night and we all sum up our days for each other.  The kids really look<br/>
forward to talking with him and so do I.  One piece of advice I would offer<br/>
is that when he is home, don&#39;t stop all of your routines trying to include<br/>
him.  It seems to work better if we keep our regular routines and let him<br/>
know he is welcome to join us or not.  It took me a while to figure that<br/>
out.  It wasn&#39;t until I started doing this that the transition of coming and<br/>
going became easier.  It used to be more difficult taking 2 days for us to<br/>
readjust to him being home or being gone.  (Or maybe the kids just got older<br/>
and so it got easier.  They are now 8 and 9.75 and it&#39;s all they&#39;ve ever<br/>
known.)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If you feel overwhelmed I think someone&#39;s idea to get a mother&#39;s helper is a<br/>
good one.  I never really felt the need to, but I only have two children.<br/>
Just don&#39;t expect too much from yourself.  Some days we still don&#39;t get<br/>
dressed or I wish the lawn was mowed 3 days ago, but it&#39;s not important in<br/>
the big picture.  I find it easier to cook too because the kids would rather<br/>
graze anyway, for the most part.  Sometimes we just have mashed potatoes for<br/>
supper.  But it all works out in the long run.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
My dh had been separated from us for about a month on a couple of occasions,<br/>
for different reasons.<br/>
<br/>
The best advice I can give you is to be prepared for a period of turmoil<br/>
when he gets back. Jayn and I had become used to each other alone, and I<br/>
think there was also some resentment on her part that he had left her so she<br/>
was pretty angry at him. It took patience and specific attention to her from<br/>
him to overcome it. I also felt a bit out of balance and had to get to<br/>
accommodating his ideas about household running too. We had slipped into<br/>
different routines, different rhythms, different priorities in the periods<br/>
while he was away.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My children&#39;s father is gone often and for long perids of time.  Ever since they were babies.  In fact my xh left for a 2 week business trip when our youngest was 3 weeks old.  Somehow through all that they have always stayed connected.  When Dan is home he is quite involved with the children.  He&#39;s always given them baths, changed diapers, held them, carried them in the slings and front packs, taken them to the parks, helped them learn things, etc.  When he has been gone for a week or more he calls them and talks to them each day.  <br/>
<br/>
My end has been harder.  Having to be &quot;on&quot; 24/7 for long stretches of time.  It is a bit easier now that they are older and I can escape for an hour or so to go do &quot;my time&quot; things.  I stamp once a month and go to Curves (when I get around to it) or run to the store to pick up a few items.  Sunday&#39;s are usually &quot;my day&quot; where I go do the weekly shopping, have a cup of tea somewhere (usually Starbucks), and read the paper.  When the kids were younger it was harder because I couldn&#39;t leave them at all much less for an hour.  There were days I just wanted to scream for some alone time.  What I found is that I would stay up later than I normally would.  I&#39;m naturally a morning person and wake at 6am at the latest.  I enjoy mornings, but in order to get some &quot;me time&quot; I found I had to stay up later and live off less sleep.  (Not recommended during the post partum period LOL!)  But it afforded me the time to stamp, scrapbook, and read undisturbed.  It helped.  I had to learn to cope with less sleep as a trade-off to having time to unwind and relax.<br/>

<br/>
My dh can be gone for weeks at a time.  The first time he did go was <br/>
when our ds was 6 weeks old and he was gone for 3 weeks.  I was in awe <br/>
of single parents.  It was really hard.  After a couple of times like <br/>
that I decided to hire someone to come in for three hours each morning. <br/>
  Just enough time for me to get a bit of a nap, shower and have <br/>
breakfast and feel like I could meet the day.  It made a HUGE <br/>
difference.  With the baby and 2 little other ones I can imagine the <br/>
idea of him leaving for this time will be really daunting.<br/>
<br/>
I agree w/ what Robyn said about the return and getting into our own <br/>
routine.  Also, I&#39;d think when he&#39;d come back, finally! I&#39;d get some <br/>
help but many times my dh was exhausted from the trip too, coming back <br/>
from Europe and a grueling schedule so he just needed to rest and go <br/>
through heavy jet lag.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever support you can get, definitely get it.  It&#39;s easy to get <br/>
isolated which can happen w/ a new baby anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

it&#39;s because he&#39;s usually only gone for one week at a time, but they <br/>
just jump on him and are thrilled at his very existance for a few <br/>
days.<br/>
