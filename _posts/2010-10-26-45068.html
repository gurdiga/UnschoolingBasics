<div id="ygrps-yiv-1647133799">Hi all - <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve got a beautiful 12 year old daughter interested in going to college some day to study computer or chemical engineering.  She is trying to figure out what she can do now to explore those subjects or prepare for getting into college to study those subjects later.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;d love some advice.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, Kathryn prepared by playing video games like Super Smash Bros  <br/>
and Pokemon and Kirby ;-)<br/>
<br/>
At 14 she took her father&#39;s college statistics and algebra classes and  <br/>
was always among the top scores on tests and homework. She found she  <br/>
wasn&#39;t quick on arithmetic (addition and multiplication), having to  <br/>
use a calculator for relatively simple stuff, but the theoretical  <br/>
stuff she had no problems with. (But it didn&#39;t take her long to catch  <br/>
up on the arithmetic.)<br/>
<br/>
Kathryn obviously has a natural bent for it though she&#39;s more drawn to  <br/>
art and writing so she never delved into math puzzles or anything.  <br/>
Just video games, allowance, tips, measuring, comparison shopping, art  <br/>
programs, spreadsheets, board and card games, loads of collections.  <br/>
Nothing other than math she encountered by living. The advantage she  <br/>
had was genes, and two parents who enjoy math, but she wasn&#39;t immersed  <br/>
in it. The amount of anything resembling formal math was on the order  <br/>
of minutes rather than 100&#39;s of hours that schooled kids get.<br/>
<br/>
The Number Devil is a fun book. It delves into some complex math in a  <br/>
chatty way.<br/>
<br/>
Puzzle and logic books that are intended for fun (not schoolish  <br/>
workbooks.)<br/>
<br/>
If you go to:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
and scroll down the left side there are several pages about math that  <br/>
might help you both see math in a new -- better! -- way. Playing with  <br/>
the ideas, using them for real will be a *much* better education than  <br/>
anything resembling textbook math.<br/>

Favorite Teacher. Khan started off explaining some math concepts to  <br/>
his nieces and nephews who were struggling with math and found he had  <br/>
a talent for making ideas clear. Now he has over 1800 short videos on  <br/>
simple to advanced math, science and some humanities.<br/>
<br/>
But unschoolers shouldn&#39;t see them as short cuts to math. They may be  <br/>
good at explaining how to formally notate the concepts but the  <br/>
concepts should be absorbed by using math in the &quot;wild&quot; -- like from  <br/>
video games :-)<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately schools do it the hard way, expecting understanding of  <br/>
the concepts to come from work with the abstract notation. It&#39;s very  <br/>
easy to test whether kids have memorized how to manipulate the  <br/>
abstract notation, which is why they do it that way. But it&#39;s really  <br/>
really hard to grasp the concepts and an understanding of what it  <br/>
means through notation.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2045252164">I don&#39;t know what computer things she is interested in studying, but she can learn a lot from library books and various websites.  If she is talking about programming <br/>
<br/>
As for college in computers, well...My brother never went to college, he did attempt a class or two and said no way....but he had already been working in the computer field for 7 years when he tried college.  He knew more than the instructors!  He has created software that is used today in places like Ford, Rite Aid/Walgreens, K-Mart and more.  All without a college degree.  He learned from a book, studying and from being able to calculate in his head.  My husband is also a programmer.  He didn&#39;t go to college for that either.  He has had his job for 10 years now.  <br/>
<br/>
I had a friend in college who studied Computer Engineering and was poorly prepared for the workplace.  Why?  Because they only teach theories and don&#39;t get actual experience for 4 years of college. He didn&#39;t learn how to change and adapt what was taught to what was actually used/needed.  <br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/express/Windows/">http://www.microsoft.com/express/Windows/</a><br/>
<br/>
look into .net, java (as most corporate websites use that), &quot;You write .NET apps with Visual Basic, C#, or other languages. VB and C# are the most popular. I recommend C# because it is, syntactically, similar to Java, so if she needed to transfer skills from C# to Java, there would be slightly less of a learning curve.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Lynda.com is a place you can subscribe to for tutorials.  I am sure there are free places on the web as well.  My hubby likes to get e-books from sitepoint.com as well as Pragprog.com and I know he has dabbled in Ruby and ruby on rails.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps and have fun!<br/>

taught computer programmer/graphic designer) attends several.  <br/>
WordPress meet up, PHP meet up, etc. The people that attend will be  <br/>
local folks who have a similar interest. She may find a person willing  <br/>
to show her the ropes. Practical experience now is more beneficial to  <br/>
book work that changes yearly. Computer languages and programming and  <br/>
engineering is far from static. It is ever evolving.<br/>
