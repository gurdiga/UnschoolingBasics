<div id="ygrps-yiv-1502402010">I&#39;m hoping for some thought sharing on the topic of child frustration, i.e.<br/>
a child who is easily frustrated and gets amped up very quickly and<br/>
intensely.  Both of my boys are this way, my 8.5yo is Autistic so his<br/>
thinking has a tendency to be pretty rigid, he can really get fixated on<br/>
things and will amp up his energy to a blowout level very quickly.  My 4.5yo<br/>
is at that age where he tends to have major ups and downs, lots of intense<br/>
emotions, etc.  He&#39;s much easier to bring down from the precipice than my<br/>
older son, but when the little ones blows, it&#39;s massive - in both noise and<br/>
physical striking out.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
In the (recent, sorry to say) past, these outburts have been met with<br/>
initial understanding and attempts to help calm them by myself and my<br/>
husband, but then ending up being yelling matches as everyone&#39;s energy goes<br/>
over the edge.  Yipes!  No fun for anyone and I always felt horrible<br/>
afterwards.  I&#39;m trying to find a way to stop myself before I go over the<br/>
edge, but listening to a shrieking child (or two, in stereo) for a long<br/>
stretch is sooo hard.  The situations I&#39;m talking about don&#39;t involve tasks<br/>
that I want them to do and they are resisting - I know better not to get<br/>
into that struggle!  These are activities they are participating in (video<br/>
games, building with legos, etc.) and it&#39;s not working out the way they<br/>
intend, or one brother has an idea that he will not bend on, which makes the<br/>
other brother flip out (because the other is equally stubborn!).  I<br/>
intervene as quickly as I can to try and head off the frustration, but they<br/>
both are the type to want it Just. That. Way. And nothing else will do,<br/>
period.  So instead of being reasonable and figuring out a work-around or<br/>
alternative, they get fixated on what the original plan was and just make<br/>
themselves nuts over it.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Has anyone been through this with intense kids, and what are the techniques<br/>
you use to keep *yourself* calm, and give the kids the support and help they<br/>
need to bring themselves down.  Any and all ideas are very welcome!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1832211003">Hello everyone,<br/>
I hope it is o.k. to ask this here. A fellow<br/>
homescholing friend of mine is going through a really<br/>
hard time (husband lost job due to injury...). I have<br/>
been researching the web for work-at-home<br/>
opportunities but am very confused and wouldn&#39;t know<br/>
who to trust. Does anyone have experience with any of<br/>
these and some  good advice or ideas? It would be much<br/>
appreciated!<br/>
All the best,<br/>
Mara <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-242299812">--- Hi Shell.  I have an Aspie boy who has inflexible thinking, so <br/>
yes, I know of what you speak.  I try to encourage him to think <br/>
outside the box at times when he is relaxed and we are not dealing <br/>
with some major issue.  RDI has helped with that too.  The problem <br/>
is, as I see it, that they have a picture of how something should be, <br/>
and when it&#39;s not that way, it&#39;s hard for them to make sense of it.  <br/>
ASD kids do tend to feel things on a much more intense level than <br/>
most people, so it&#39;s a real struggle for them to find balance.<br/>
I always try to keep that in mind, and it helps me to remember that <br/>
he&#39;s doing his best at all times to cope with his world.<br/>
<br/>
You could maybe start working on this with an activity in which you <br/>
lead, so they are looking to you for guidance.  Could be cooking, <br/>
gardening, making a craft.  If they are unfamiliar with something, <br/>
they will need some guidance, and be less likely to have already <br/>
formed a picture of what the activity or project is supposed to look <br/>
like.  Do this when you have lots of time, so they don&#39;t feel <br/>
pressured to finish something quickly and make your movements slow.  <br/>
This always helps my boy.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-636441223">I don&#39;t have much advise, I do have intense kids. I know that if I  <br/>
try to resolve anything, i am prolonging the frustration and anger  <br/>
because with MY kids they don&#39;t WANT me to help. What they want is a  <br/>
witness and validator for their anger and frustration. If I try to  <br/>
get involved in some manner, I&#39;ve basically reset the entire episode,  <br/>
because they feel like I&#39;m not doing my job.<br/>
<br/>
That really depends on the child, and the situation, so I don&#39;t know  <br/>
how meaningful that is for you. My calm has been slow in developing,  <br/>
because for the longest time I fell into the trap that 1) their  <br/>
feelings mirrored my parenting and 2) that I was here to &#39;fix&#39; them  <br/>
and keep them from being upset. As time has passed, I&#39;ve managed to  <br/>
relinquish those mainstream thoughts, and let them own their  <br/>
emotions. I do step in when I&#39;m needed, and that just takes practice.  <br/>
i do step in when someone is about to get hurt (oddly enough it&#39;s my  <br/>
ten yo and my four yo, usually the younger going after the latter) We  <br/>
have varying stages of spectrumy disorder, so I know what you mean  <br/>
about one triggering the others. It gets better though....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1331424644">Are you peeking through my window?? HA!   <br/>
I have a 12 yr old daughter with autism and a 6 yr old son who has<br/>
sensory issues (probably on the spectrum also but we don&#39;t feel a need<br/>
for a dx at this point)  They are both intense, rigid and clash like<br/>
oil and water whenever they try to do anything together (like live ,<br/>
eat at the same table , breath the same air... inhabit the same<br/>
planet!)    <br/>
I do have times when I just have to send them away from each other<br/>
because one is really riding roughshod over the other and because of<br/>
their issues they often can&#39;t disengage without the suggestion.   Our<br/>
therapist has been working with our daughter on role playing ways to<br/>
work out things, remove herself from the situation and knowing which<br/>
to do when etc.   My son is so intense and so set on something turning<br/>
out in his hands exactly as his mind imagined it that he is often<br/>
overwhelmed and frustrated.    It&#39;s easy to lose your temper and flare<br/>
back at them but I am sure you have noticed it just inflames the<br/>
situation!    I try to remain calm and agree that I understand they<br/>
are upset and/or frustrated, I try to get him to show me or explain to<br/>
me what he is trying to accomplish... sometimes I offer suggestions<br/>
(usually offering several is more helpful because they really don&#39;t<br/>
appreciate being told what to do ... they don&#39;t mind help but they<br/>
don&#39;t like edicts)  sometimes just having me verbally trouble shoot<br/>
helps him because he has a bit of a word retrieval issue and it&#39;s hard<br/>
for him to explain to me where his brain is going with something.   My<br/>
daughter really needs to feel heard and to have as much control over<br/>
her environment as is comfortable for the rest of us.   Her autism has<br/>
provided some pretty awesome gifts ... we try to allow them to<br/>
flourish even if it makes life at our house disorderly (think<br/>
thousands of half used sheets of drawing paper swirling around her<br/>
room and various other parts of the house)   <br/>
There are times when I suggest to one or the other of them that maybe<br/>
taking a break would help them come back fresh to the situation and be<br/>
able to approach it with fresh eyes.    Sometimes I tell them I am<br/>
frustrated and need to take a break and will come back to help them in<br/>
a few minutes.    I think that when you are dealing with kids that are<br/>
frustrated it&#39;s so important to show them good coping skills...<br/>
imagine them as adults and thinking it&#39;s ok to hit or yell because<br/>
they are frustrated with someone.    I would much rather see my<br/>
children as adults who can remove themselves from a heated situation<br/>
and return when they are able to be cool and respectful and agree or<br/>
disagree in a civil manner.  I know that my children get their<br/>
intensity in part from me...I try to remember that so I understand<br/>
that and respect that rather than seeing it as something to be fixed.<br/>
  Sometimes its a trait in myself that I don&#39;t like much so I really<br/>
have to consciously put a positive spin on it!   Another thing you may<br/>
already know but with intense kids they often have a need for deep<br/>
pressure/crashing type movements... I find that just sort of wrapping<br/>
my arms around him (not an actual hug because he may not be able to<br/>
allow that at that moment) and holding him firmly calms his sensory<br/>
system and reorients his brain from sending off flares.  Also speaking<br/>
quietly can sometimes help them bring it down a few notches as well.    <br/>
One thing that sends my son over the edge is when I think I will just<br/>
take something from his hands and fix it to make his life easier...OH<br/>
BOY does that make him crazy... it just steals his power and makes him<br/>
miserable!   For me this is one of the things that was a light bulb<br/>
moment of why taking away artificial limits, rules and giving him<br/>
freedom makes so much sense.  Making another person powerless is the<br/>
worst sort of prison! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1568795243">I personally do work from home, but I do not want to use this as an<br/>
advertising forum. If you are interested learning what I personally<br/>
do, please email me off list. <br/>
<br/>
There are tons of moms, of all kinds, that are searching for work at<br/>
home. Some of them want work at home JOBS, others want to look into<br/>
Business Opportunities or Home Based Businesses. Which ever you are<br/>
looking for I would like to give you a bit of advice.<br/>
 <br/>
If you are looking for a work at home JOB:<br/>
-DO NOT pay anyone for you to work for them. Just like if you went<br/>
down to the local supermarket, fast food resturant, etc. You wouldn&#39;t<br/>
pay them.<br/>
-If you live in a big area try mystery shopping.<br/>
-If you don&#39;t mind having it take forever to accumulate some money you<br/>
could try online surveys.<br/>
<br/>
If you are looking for Business Ops or Home Based Businesses:<br/>
-There WILL be start up costs! Plain and simple.<br/>
-Listen to all of them that come your way. If you don&#39;t really listen<br/>
you may just pass up a great opportunity.<br/>
-Take Notes!!<br/>
-Do tons of research on everything to do with Home Based Businesses.<br/>
-Go to the Better Business Bureau website and search through the<br/>
companies they feel are legit.<br/>
-Make sure your investment, no matter what the amount is protected by<br/>
some sort of guarantee in case things don&#39;t pan out for you.<br/>
<br/>
Here is some advice that could be for either:<br/>
My advice to all who are looking for work at home is look into<br/>
everything. Find what fits you the best. If you don&#39;t feel it doesn&#39;t<br/>
fit you and your live move on to the next one. Don&#39;t sign-up if you<br/>
feel even a bit hesitate. That hesitation will always be in the back<br/>
of your mind and it could be the reason many people<br/>
aren&#39;t successful at home based businesses or even just home JOBS.<br/>
Trust your gut and remember your dreams and goals. So many have heard<br/>
horror stories of all the scams out there. It is OK to be cautious,<br/>
that&#39;s smart!<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps you all in your search for whatever kind of work<br/>
at home you are looking for. Whether it&#39;s a JOB or Busniess Op. it&#39;s<br/>
important to find the one that fits you, remember that in your search.<br/>
<br/>
I also have a list of links I can email to you, to check for scams.<br/>
Just email me off list and I will get those to you. <br/>

this situation!  It&#39;s always nice to know that one is not alone, and<br/>
you&#39;ve brought up ideas which I&#39;ve tried in the past (like the deep<br/>
pressure!) that I haven&#39;t used in a while.  I&#39;m finding that just<br/>
being present and letting the kids know that nobody is &quot;in trouble&quot;,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1561207770">What Sarah wrote below is really, really great advice.<br/>
<br/>
I just have one thing to add.  IF you are looking into a direct sales<br/>
company for a Home Business opportunity, (Pampered Chef, Tupperware, Mary<br/>
Kay, Creative Memories to name just a few) shop around for your upline!<br/>
Talk to some of her other downline, attend one of her meetings, and make<br/>
sure she is in it for the long-haul, is an effective trainer, and supports<br/>
and motivates her team.  Let her know how much you need to make each month<br/>

down to the local supermarket, fast food resturant, etc. You wouldn&#39;t<br/>
pay them.<br/>
-If you live in a big area try mystery shopping.<br/>
-If you don&#39;t mind having it take forever to accumulate some money you<br/>
could try online surveys.<br/>
<br/>
If you are looking for Business Ops or Home Based Businesses:<br/>
-There WILL be start up costs! Plain and simple.<br/>
-Listen to all of them that come your way. If you don&#39;t really listen<br/>
you may just pass up a great opportunity.<br/>
-Take Notes!!<br/>
-Do tons of research on everything to do with Home Based Businesses.<br/>
-Go to the Better Business Bureau website and search through the<br/>
companies they feel are legit.<br/>
-Make sure your investment, no matter what the amount is protected by<br/>
some sort of guarantee in case things don&#39;t pan out for you.<br/>
<br/>
Here is some advice that could be for either:<br/>
My advice to all who are looking for work at home is look into<br/>
everything. Find what fits you the best. If you don&#39;t feel it doesn&#39;t<br/>
fit you and your live move on to the next one. Don&#39;t sign-up if you<br/>
feel even a bit hesitate. That hesitation will always be in the back<br/>
of your mind and it could be the reason many people<br/>
aren&#39;t successful at home based businesses or even just home JOBS.<br/>
Trust your gut and remember your dreams and goals. So many have heard<br/>
horror stories of all the scams out there. It is OK to be cautious,<br/>
that&#39;s smart!<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps you all in your search for whatever kind of work<br/>
at home you are looking for. Whether it&#39;s a JOB or Busniess Op. it&#39;s<br/>
important to find the one that fits you, remember that in your search.<br/>
<br/>
I also have a list of links I can email to you, to check for scams.<br/>
Just email me off list and I will get those to you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1336675064">Also, make sure you&#39;ve checked into the legal and tax ramifications of<br/>
the situation - who pays what and when - for instance, if you have to<br/>
collect sales tax, that has to be accounted for and paid to the proper<br/>
agency with certain forms by certain dates. Sometimes, whomever you work<br/>
for will handle that and then send you a check for your portion of the<br/>
&#39;sale&#39;, other times, you have to sort it out yourself. You&#39;ll also need<br/>
to deal with the income tax ramifications of it. And, in some areas,<br/>
there are certain types of things that can and cannot be run out of your<br/>
home (regulated by zoning ordinances). Typically, if you are going<br/>
someplace it&#39;s okay but if people are coming to you (increasing traffic<br/>
on the street, parking issues, etc) then there might be questions.<br/>
Likewise, if you are stocking quantities of something, taking many<br/>
deliveries, etc that&#39;d be different than something where you process the<br/>
orders and the item(s) are drop shipped directly to the purchaser.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1529630453">I wish I had some easy fix, but it&#39;s taken (okay, honesty break, it  <br/>
is STILL taking) time in my happy shiny unschooly community. It&#39;s  <br/>
taken people here and at the shine list to remind me to look at what  <br/>
my OWN triggers are...and realize that I&#39;m allowing someone else&#39;s  <br/>
emotions to trigger mine. And then to step back and realize that my  <br/>
biggest childhood baggage has been my own mother not allowing me to  <br/>
have feelings that made HER uncomfortable.   So I&#39;ve replaced it with  <br/>
physical things. If the kids are upset, then I remind myself to just  <br/>
sit and listen. I honest to goodness bite my tongue. If I&#39;m in the  <br/>
middle of two upset kids, I tell them that I&#39;m overwhelmed and ask if  <br/>
I can have some time to think about what they said. I snuggle with  <br/>
them alternatively.<br/>
