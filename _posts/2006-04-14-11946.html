Actually you don&#39;t have to worry about Google fixing this.   It&#39;s been like<br/>
that for a couple years.  There are some others that I  can&#39;t quite remember<br/>
right now, but I have a feeling that the Googlites are  very to the left in<br/>
the political spectrum.  It&#39;s fun to play around  with the &quot;I&#39;m Feeling<br/>
Lucky&quot; button.  If you type in google and click  the lucky button you end<br/>
right back where you are  :)<br/>

oh sorry, i just thought it was funny......told you i wasn&#39;t good at  looking <br/>
stuff up online!<br/>
