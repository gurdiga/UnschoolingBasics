<div id="ygrps-yiv-1143462315">Pam,  <br/>
What your mom thought of Montessori does not describe very well my experience with <br/>
Montessori.    We had a dress up corner and a popular art room with paints and other art <br/>
supplies always accessible with special art projects now and then.    We had stories and <br/>
singing every day, the Montessori bells were always available to play, and there was lots of <br/>
make believe on the playground.    The children could use the Montessori materials in <br/>
whatever logical way they wished.   There is an advantage to large classes because the <br/>
children are choosing activities on their own and learning from each other, which fosters a <br/>
surprising independence from intrusion by an adult.   The name Montessori is not <br/>
copyrighted, so anyone can start a Montessori school, and there is quite a variety among <br/>
them.  I hope people reading this post will not make assumptions about Montessori but <br/>
will go observe at their local Montessori school if they are interested.   Linda</div>

<br/>
I incorporated a lot of Montessori into my home when my kids were young, <br/>
but rejected much of it for precisely the reasons Pam noted. The lessons <br/>
and right way to use toys was *far* too rigid in my opinion and closed <br/>
down much learning.<br/>
<br/>
Take the nesting boxes, for example. Kids would be shown how to use <br/>
them, correctly stacking from largest to smallest, totally bypassing all <br/>
the amazing experiments that can be done by stacking them in different <br/>
ways.<br/>
<br/>
Waldorf, too, has many wonderful creative aspects to it, and I&#39;m very <br/>
drawn to the reverence of nature, etc. But too rigid--it, too, shuts <br/>
down so many learning opportunities.<br/>
<br/>
Nope. I choose unschooling, hands down.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1712653597">I have rejected two different messages that espoused how wonderful<br/>
Montessori is and how we as unschoolers should be learning about it.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, this is a list to help people understand unschooling. <br/>
Secondly, most people here are fully aware of Maria Montessori&#39;s work<br/>
and other educational philosophies. Most people don&#39;t GET to<br/>
unschooling without learning a lot about education and learning in<br/>
general.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m posting this because I think the topic of various educational<br/>
philosohpies is a valid discussion. The reason I rejected the posts<br/>
was not to avoid a discussion on various educational philosophies and<br/>
the merits or demerits of each, but because I feel it is disrespectful<br/>
to the list members that joine here to learn about UNSCHOOLING.<br/>
<br/>
So, to further this conversation, I am posting a small part of one<br/>
post that I rejected. I figured it will foster a discussion without<br/>
the list feeling &quot;preached at&quot; about how great Montessori is.<br/>
<br/>
My issues with the following post are:  Unschoolers are quite aware of<br/>
a child&#39;s need to be involved in real work and invited into the adult<br/>
world. If the poster had read here for more than a week, that much<br/>
would be obvious.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, how does Montessori meet these needs better than<br/>
unschooling??  The truth is, it doesn&#39;t.  While Maria Montessori had<br/>
some great ideas about kids, the schools can&#39;t possibly give a child<br/>
the freedom AND nourishment that an involved parent can.<br/>
<br/>
Anon:<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
I am not suggesting that people close doors to homeschooling or<br/>
unschooling and all run to put their kids into a Montessori school.  <br/>
Rather, Montessori presents a wonderful side<br/>
of children that people often miss--how kids not only love fantasy,but<br/>
they love reality as well.   Kids not only love to play, but they love<br/>
to work and do what they see adults doing.<br/>
<br/>
Kids love to stretch themselves and do hard things (as long as they<br/>
choose it themselves) and to do it themselves.   They are pulled by<br/>
their own interest like a magnet into such activities and they get<br/>
tremendous satisfaction out of doing these things.    The<br/>
Montessori environment is a response to the children&#39;s desire in<br/>
this direction.<br/>
<br/>
 Also, Montessori does not close the door to play, fantasy, art,<br/>
music, dance, poetry, love of<br/>
nature, etc., but these are all an integral part of Montessori as<br/>
well.  Why not give the kids everything?</div>

already giving their children everything.  :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Gee, I thought through unschooling I was.  :-)  I don&#39;t think that<br/>
most unschoolers need someone else to offer all these things to their<br/>
kids.  However you put it, Montessori is still SCHOOL and that doesn&#39;t<br/>
foster an unschooling environment.  I believe that most unschoolers<br/>
are happily providing all the things that Maria Montessori (and all<br/>
the pseudo Montessoris) are saying are important for a child while at<br/>
the same time offering much much more!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1127809172">I&#39;ve always been a fan of Montessori in part because I started in one<br/>
and loved it as a little kid. And I do think that if I had to choose<br/>
between Montessori and public school, I&#39;d pick a good Montessori<br/>
because there is more freedom and individuality built in. <br/>
<br/>
But, now that I&#39;m older and a mom myself, and after 2 years of reading<br/>
up on child development, education, and the like, I do think the best<br/>
thing is an unschooling environment because only then is each kid free<br/>
to become whatever he wants to be and however he wants to do it.</div>
