<div id="ygrps-yiv-1741702053">Sorry to be asking for so much help, but I am at a loss for how to deal with these issues in the context of unschooling.  My current dilemas are with my 2 year old dd and having her sit in her car seat and with her wearing a diaper.  <br/>
<br/>
Whenever we get in the car she&#39;ll get in the way back (we have a mini van) and run around.  When I ask her to sit in the car seat she refuses.  When I try to assist her she screams &quot;I want to do it&quot; (meaning climb in herself) which is absolutely fine with me, but then she won&#39;t get in.  I keep a box with books, bubbles, travel games and snacks so she can have/do something in her car seat, but that isn&#39;t motivating her either.  If my older dd is with me she will model the desired behavior by sitting in her car seat, but that doesn&#39;t do anything.  I have just sat and tried to wait it out but after 10-15 minutes my patience runs out and sometimes we have to be somewhere.  I have been trying to leave extra early to allow for waiting for her to comply with getting in her car seat.  It is the law that she needs to ride in the car seat and there is obviously the safety implications.  What else can I do?  Most times I have to go somewhere I am alone so I have to take her with me.<br/>
<br/>
My second situation is that she likes to be bottomless and is in the process of self initiated potty training.  Whenever I take off her diaper or after her bath she will go bonkers running around the house with nothing on her.  I have given her the choice of wearing underwear (over a diaper and alone), a pull up or diaper.  I don&#39;t think it is sanitary for her to be running around bottomless since she will sit on things and roll around on the floor.  At night I will allow her to run around like this a little bit to get it out of her system, but when I tell her that it is time to put something on she throws a tantrum. <br/>
<br/>
I am trying really hard not to get frustrated and resort the conventional parenting strategies, but I don&#39;t know what to do in these situations.  I don&#39;t feel it is really a choice to do these things.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1154079128">Jen my kids loved to go without pants. My 3 year old still does.<br/>
I have no problems with it. <br/>
Try buying some special underwear she would like.<br/>
Maybe she likes Little Pony, Dora or Disney Princesses.<br/>
But let her run around in the house. What are you worried that is not sanitary?<br/>
I live in a farm and believe me my kids never got anything in their nether regions for going bare butt!<br/>
<br/>
As for the car seat you need to find a reason for her to get in .<br/>
Yes allowing time is great but maybe she needs more time or different incentive.<br/>
a promise to go to a place she likes. To get ice cream maybe?<br/>
A DVD player with her favorite movie.<br/>
What does she like?<br/>
Is that car seat uncomfortable to her?<br/>
My kids had fases like that but we always talked about how car seats make it safer <br/>
and they actually would not go anywhere without one and would let me know<br/>
if they are not buckled up.<br/>
And we found resons to want to go places.<br/>

<br/>
***Don&#39;t be sorry we are all learning all the time :-) It can be really<br/>
trying to get a toddler or small child in the car seat. They can be rather<br/>
unreasonable so reasoning doesn&#39;t always work. I am frustrated by the same<br/>
thing sometimes. I have a 1 1/2 y/o. And yes it is the law and I am<br/>
unwilling to bend on that issue but I can still be thoughtful and respectful<br/>
to my child. Leaving earlier during this time is a great idea.<br/>
<br/>
What i do is try to make the car trips exciting. We have special car toys<br/>
like you do and I change them up frequently to keep it lively. We keep<br/>
special single bad snacks in the car that are &quot;car snacks&quot; stuff that were<br/>
generally don&#39;t have anywhere but the car. We have portable gaming devices<br/>
(DS lites) and a portable dvd player (although my littlest have zero<br/>
interest in TV/movies). I sing songs and play car games. The car is<br/>
generally a fun place to be. We do still have occasional stand-offs :-) I<br/>
find that the less in and out during errand running time is the best. Also<br/>
we try to have more days with no car riding following days when we were in<br/>
the car a lot.<br/>

<br/>
OP: My second situation is that she likes to be bottomless and is in the<br/>
process of self initiated potty training. Whenever I take off her diaper or<br/>

something on she throws a tantrum.<br/>
<br/>
***All mine have wanted to be bottomless around that age especially.<br/>
Toileting is so much easier without pants in the way :-) My youngest is<br/>
finished with diapers. She just refused to wear them anymore except for bed.<br/>
She is typically naked or bottomless around the house. I am not sure why you<br/>
think it is unsanitary. Are you concerned about her health or the house<br/>
having &quot;butt germs&quot;? I have never had any of my children have any issue with<br/>
their bottoms from being naked. And I think if you keep there bums clean<br/>
then they are any less sanitary than any other body part. If my child pees<br/>
or poops outside of the potty I just clean it up and spray some cleaner on<br/>
the area. it really isn&#39;t a big deal.<br/>
I have a couple small potties that I have spread through our house so she<br/>
can toilet easily.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-974778959">One thought:<br/>
Have play time in the car. With lots of exploration and fun--turning on the windshield washers and blinkers--with you in it, she&#39;ll be safe and watched over. And let her explore it to her heart&#39;s content. That&#39;ll help get the power struggle out of the situation. <br/>
<br/>
If you feel yourself getting tense, take a breath!! Unless she&#39;s about to break a knob or fall against some icky, oily hinge, why can&#39;t she check it all out?--to her it&#39;s fascinating! You can always refill the washer fluid, you can sing to the blinky blinky of the turn signals. How cool is it that she&#39;s discovered a &quot;playhouse&quot; that&#39;s her size! <br/>
<br/>
Find out what&#39;s got her attention. Enjoy it with her and help her check it all out, all the little secret compartments and holding pockets. It&#39;s all very cool. My son, at 9, *still* loves to hang out in the car when we can. When we have to go, we go, but if we can hang out, he loves just kicking back and talking and looking at the trees or birds through the window or off the tailgate. <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve already made it comfy, with the books and bubbles and snacks and blankies, just expand the &quot;playroom&quot; to the whole car when you can. Then when you *have to* go somewhere, maybe it&#39;ll be easier for her cuz she&#39;ll be satisfied.<br/>
And no, I didn&#39;t say leave her in the car by herself at any time. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And as far as the diaper thing---same advice sort of. Let her have lots of time naked. She wants to do it. If she&#39;s relatively clean and washed, it&#39;s not dangerously germy. Let her have control over her undies and diapers. That&#39;s *real* &quot;self initiated potty training&quot;. Make it her choice completely. You can voice your preferences, of course, to not have her go on the floor (or in the bed), but you can work out the solution for that *with* her. Most kids don&#39;t want to have an accident on the floor/bed either.<br/>
<br/>
I have to head out right now, but I hope that helps.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well here&#39;s another idea: If you really have to get somewhere urgently, find a way for her to stay home. Have someone else come over and hang out with her for a little, while you are out. That way, the whole process could be less trausmatzing for the both of you! Eventually, she&#39;s going to have to get into the car seat, but that&#39;s probably a good problem to try to figure out when neither of you are rushed or upset.</div>

 </span></blockquote>When DS was car seat size, I had a personal two stop maximum if he was<br/>
going along on errands - that is, any time he had to get out, was a<br/>
&#39;stop&#39; (I could squeak in an extra errand if I used a bank drive thru<br/>
for instance because there was no in and out involved).<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Timing was also important - if DS was going along on errands or<br/>
whatever, there were two windows of opportunity at that age, mornings<br/>
after breakfast for an hour or so and early afternoons after lunch, one<br/>
OR the other, not both in the same day. Late morning and late afternoon<br/>
were just not good. Now that DS is about to turn 11, mornings in general<br/>
aren&#39;t great unless he&#39;s in a day shift sleep schedule so we try to plan<br/>
any goings that include him for after lunch or early evening whenever<br/>
possible.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1967383961">On the car seat issue, patience and time, making a game of it all. My 4 yr old really wants to get to be a big kid so he doesn&#39;t have to sit in one. Honestly the things look uncomfortable to me. We take several important items with us and we race to the car. Those items are a sippy cup (I keep an extra handy in the cooler in the car so it is already full and ready to go at the first stop and I cycle them through and frozen juice boxes, they work well for ice packs and defrost on hot days quickly), favorite snack food, favorite toy of the moment, pillow and favorite blanket. Actually both kids bring their pillows and blankets along no matter the weather. My son always gets to win and be first into the car, by himself. He chatters constantly so I keep up with his chatter as he climbs in and gets situated. This can take 10-15 minutes. I know that the first sign of my impatience, even when I try to hide it, it takes twice as long because he gets frustrated.<br/>
 Being first, being a big kid, and doing things by himself are very important.<br/>
<br/>
As for the naked bum, no reason not to let her run naked. If you do a general cleaning and mop up accidents quickly sanitation isn&#39;t an issue. My daughter ran naked right up until she started school (she went k-3rd). My 4 yr old woke up this morning and actually put clothes on because the house was a bit chilly from the air conditioner. However, I suspect he will be naked soon enough. Having a naked bum while potty training is a huge benefit. Dealing with pulling pants or under pants up and down causes frustration. When a little one says they have to go the translation is they had to go 10 minutes ago. Let her be proud of her little body and show it off. I think the pictures my mom took of me while potty training I was naked in all of them. I would also recommend keeping a potty chair in various rooms and taking one with you when you go out. They just can&#39;t wait when they say they have to go.  :)<br/>

My advice as well.  Potty training went so fast for my kids as they were always naked and there was always a potty seat close by.  Sometimes you can even pick up the straddle European style ones at the dollar store--for a dollar! Have one for every room, and one for the car!  :)<br/>

Not necessarily - if there&#39;s a way for her to stay home until she<br/>
reaches the age/weight/height limit by law (which varies state to<br/>
state), she may never need to be in a carseat at all. Or, she may get to<br/>
where a basic booster is adequate (just enough to raise her up to use<br/>
the shoulder/lap belt) and the full car seat isn&#39;t needed. That was one<br/>
thing that was important to DS - he got to a point where his car seat<br/>
was too small for him even though he was within the age/weight range of<br/>
the device. His height however was a different story. We had to move to<br/>
a different size/style car seat for him for a time (before he out grew<br/>
car seats completely).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-259049957">OR take public transportation.  Taking the bus is great fun for my daughter, who really doesn&#39;t like the car seat.  We went to Life Is Good conference last weekend via Amtrak, so she wouldn&#39;t have to ride in the car seat--and she liked the train a lot--there were movies to watch, and people to talk to, and she could walk up and down the isle with mom or dad whenever she wanted to...and nursing and eating and sleeping all were available whenever she needed them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2105289691">Hi,<br/>
about the diaper thing: my now 4 y.o. hated them too. Fortunately I found Diaper Free Baby (http://www.diaperfreebaby.org) as well as some books about Elimination Communication. It is basically just tuning into her signals when she needs to go and offering opportunities. My guy went naked a LOT and  I just let him unless we had to go somewhere. We did have some accidents, and I did use a lot of Bac-out at some point. But he also was out of diapers at 1. He went back into them at around 14 months and a few months later was out for good. He never peed in bed after around 1 y.o. but had to go right when waking up. Sometimes if he woke up to nurse he needed to go after and he would just give me the sign (he was  not verbal for some time). There are some soft cottony pads you can put on the bed for protection and then she could sleep naked. That might help as well. <br/>
Playtime in the car might help as well.<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

&gt; Sorry to be asking for so much help, but I am at a loss for how to deal with these issues in the context of unschooling.  My current dilemas are with my 2 year old dd and having her sit in her car seat and with her wearing a diaper. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Whenever we get in the car she&#39;ll get in the way back (we have a mini van) and run around.  When I ask her to sit in the car seat she refuses.  When I try to assist her she screams &quot;I want to do it&quot; (meaning climb in herself) which is absolutely fine with me, but then she won&#39;t get in.  I keep a box with books, bubbles, travel games and snacks so she can have/do something in her car seat, but that isn&#39;t motivating her either.  If my older dd is with me she will model the desired behavior by sitting in her car seat, but that doesn&#39;t do anything.  I have just sat and tried to wait it out but after 10-15 minutes my patience runs out and sometimes we have to be somewhere.  I have been trying to leave extra early to allow for waiting for her to comply with getting in her car seat.  It is the law that she needs to ride in the car seat and there is obviously the safety implications.  What else can I do?  Most times I have to go somewhere I am alone so I have<br/>
 to take her with me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My second situation is that she likes to be bottomless and is in the process of self initiated potty training.  Whenever I take off her diaper or after her bath she will go bonkers running around the house with nothing on her.  I have given her the choice of wearing underwear (over a diaper and alone), a pull up or diaper.  I don&#39;t think it is sanitary for her to be running around bottomless since she will sit on things and roll around on the floor.  At night I will allow her to run around like this a little bit to get it out of her system, but when I tell her that it is time to put something on she throws a tantrum. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am trying really hard not to get frustrated and resort the conventional parenting strategies, but I don&#39;t know what to do in these situations.  I don&#39;t feel it is really a choice to do these things.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
&gt; Jen<br/>
