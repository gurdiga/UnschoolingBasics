<div id="ygrps-yiv-1432583357">A number of months ago this group had a discussion about kids writing <br/>
on the walls.  My 7 year old was writing on the walls and I thought <br/>
I&#39;d share with y&#39;all the solution we came up with.  <br/>
<br/>
My husband went to Home Depot and bought two huge pieces of Plexi <br/>
Glass.  He attached them to the walls with mirror mounts.  We put one <br/>
in her room and one in the play room.  She can write on them with <br/>
markers or dry erase markers, and then just takes a damp rag to wipe <br/>
it off when she wants to start all over again.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1397739033">if you have a brick house you can give them chalk and let them make their own mural ...sprays off with a hose. <br/>
   <br/>
  Or they have that chalkboard paint that you can do a wall with <br/>
   <br/>
  Or get a huge white board and dry erase markers <br/>
   <br/>
  or cover a wall with butcher paper <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-201712131">Yeah, if you color really thickly and then just &quot;paint&quot; water over <br/>
the top, it kindof soaks into all the crevices, I think it&#39;s pretty <br/>
much the same as sidewalk chalk paint, which we like, too, but the <br/>
chalk is cheaper, and less messy for the little kids. Well, I dunno, <br/>
it&#39;s all messy! That&#39;s why I like hoses!<br/>

Also, I found a blurb in a Living magazine about making surfaces <br/>
into chalkboards, you can use really flat any color paint at all, <br/>
and mix unsanded tile grout into it, and anything can be a <br/>
chalkboard! I will find the article and give the measurements!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   A number of months ago this group had a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; discussion about kids <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; writing<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on the walls. My 7 year old was writing on<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; walls and I <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; thought<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;d share with y&#39;all the solution we came up<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; with.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My husband went to Home Depot and bought two<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; huge pieces of Plexi<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Glass. He attached them to the walls with<br/>
&gt; mirror<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; mounts. We put <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; one<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in her room and one in the play room. She<br/>
&gt; can<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; write on them with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; markers or dry erase markers, and then just<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; takes a damp rag to <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; wipe<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it off when she wants to start all over<br/>
&gt; again.<br/>
