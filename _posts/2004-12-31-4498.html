<div id="ygrps-yiv-918516089">Hello...<br/>
 <br/>
  Hi.(Kelly)I appreciate your views on this.I do think there are good <br/>
and bad sides with unschooling(and homeschooling) as with a lot of <br/>
things in life.I dont think you really want me to make lists,uhg.<br/>
   I think it is great that everyone can be free to choose what they <br/>
feel is right for their family.<br/>
    When I first started homeschooling several years ago I read a lot <br/>
on homeschooling and curriculums ect.,we tried many different <br/>
curriculums .(I remember when I first read about unschooling-I <br/>
thought it was a bunch of people who were just to lazy to teach their <br/>
kids-until I really read up on it.)  and for a while we tried <br/>
unschooling.I am not a wealthy person and dont have lots of money to <br/>
go to museums-zoos-ect all the time and even the library is a problem <br/>
as my 2 year old thinks its a playground and my baby will not be put <br/>
down.And truthfully I was just scared of my children growing up <br/>
ignorant.<br/>
  I just wonder what if my teenager never picks up a book and only <br/>
watches cartoons?My husband was constantly moving as a child and he <br/>
has a terrible time spelling,reading,or using a map, not to mention <br/>
managing money uhg!- ect..I dont want my kids to grow up saying why <br/>
didnt my parents teach me about this or that instead of waiting for <br/>
me to show an interest in it.<br/>
  Ren-thank you also for your advice(I am saving all of it in a <br/>
folder to read as needed).But I am registered with an umbrella school <br/>
which wants work and progress presented at the end of the year.Are <br/>
you registered with the state or an umbrella school?How does it work <br/>
for you.What about speech problems or other problems?<br/>
   Believe me I am not for school-I had terrible experience in school <br/>
and I will never , ever subject my children to that!I really do want <br/>
to understand where you all are coming from...<br/>
                        Thanks again,<br/>
                                      Jeanne</div>

Nothing is stopping your DH from learning these things better if HE <br/>
feels that he wants to, right?  Learning does not stop at the age of <br/>
18.  If you don&#39;t learn ____ before then . . . well, you have your <br/>
whole life to learn it IF it is important to YOU to know it.  There are <br/>
*tons* of things that I learned as an adult and may not have really <br/>
grasped it as a child or teen.<br/>
<br/>
Also, knowing how to do _____ doesn&#39;t mean that everyone is going to be <br/>
an expert or that it will be effortless for them.  Not everyone is <br/>
really skilled in ______ , but they know enough to use and that&#39;s good <br/>
enough for them.  I hope I&#39;m making sense.  LOL<br/>

This is so true.  Math was an issue with me.  I could easily work the problems but I didn&#39;t have a clue what I was doing or why.  Not until my thirties did it start to make sense.  In school, they wanted me to think about the numbers in a particular way....and I still have trouble doing it the &quot;right&quot; way.  But I can easily maneuver numbers in my head the &quot;Julie&quot; way with no problem and get the same results.<br/>

things in life.I dont think you really want me to make  lists,uhg.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Actually, that&#39;s exactly what I want.<br/>
 <br/>
The only con I know of is dealing with in-laws/grands/family and the  <br/>
occasional outspoken stranger.<br/>
 <br/>
I honestly can&#39;t think one other con of unschooling. There&#39;s nothing in a  <br/>
school setting that can&#39;t be found in the real world, but there&#39;s plenty of  the <br/>
real world not represented in school. I&#39;m talking of POSITIVE things. <br/>
 <br/>
There are plenty of negatives with homeschooling, but NOT  unschooling.<br/>
 <br/>
So, yes, I&#39;m asking for a list.<br/>
 <br/>
When someone comes here stating that there are cons to unschooling, it  leads <br/>
others to think that there *must* be. There aren&#39;t. <br/>
 <br/>
And as for kids who are unhappy with unschooling. I want names!  &lt;g&gt; I want <br/>
books/articles. And ones that are actually UNSCHOOLING. I have  no use for <br/>
people who are neglecting their kids in the guise of unschooling or  who are <br/>
unschooling except for math or who unschool but limit  TV/videogames/food/sleep. <br/>
Give me something that I can relate to. Kids who  are unhappy in their <br/>
unschooling lives. <br/>
 <br/>
Got any?<br/>
 <br/>
~Kelly, who doesn&#39;t know ONE SINGLE person who wouldn&#39;t want my kids&#39;  <br/>
unschooling lives<br/>

help your kids more than it did him?<br/>

My daughter is awesome at reading, spelling and using<br/>

school...Moving from school to school doesn&#39;t make you<br/>
bad at those things any more than staying in one<br/>
school makes you good at them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My mom went to 23 different schools. She skipped two grades and went to <br/>
UC Berkeley at 16 years old. She was a natural speller, voracious <br/>
reader, and world traveler with framed maps all over the walls of her <br/>
house. School didn&#39;t ruin her - and neither did moving constantly. <br/>
School was sometimes good and sometimes bad - but most of the time it <br/>
was at least not home - which wasn&#39;t good because they were very poor <br/>
and her father was very harsh and her parents both had tuberculosis and <br/>
died when she was a young teen, after which she was moved around to <br/>
different relatives and eventually to a boarding school.<br/>

<br/>
I too would like to see your thoughts on pros and cons of unschooling.  I find it helpful to hear what other peoples concerns are so that i can evaluate my own understandings.  By hearing alternative points of views it can either strengthens my convictions or opens my mind to new ideas - or a bit of both.  Either way, it may be useful to hear.  Please, Jeanne, give us your list.  <br/>
<br/>
You also mentioned &#39;reading about children who were unhappy about it and some who love it.&#39;  Where did you read about these instances?<br/>
<br/>
I know some truly committed unschooling families in which one or more of their children have chosen school after having been truly unschooled their entire lives...but this does not negate the families unschooling approach to life and learning.  In fact, it is recognizing the individual child&#39;s desires and supporting them in their choices that continues to make these families active voices in our local unschooling community.<br/>
