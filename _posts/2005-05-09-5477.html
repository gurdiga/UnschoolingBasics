I am going through some issues with this and was wondering how you are handling it?<br/>

Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to this group, though not new to the idea of unschooling, and I <br/>
saw something mentioned about a conference in October in St. Louis.  <br/>
I&#39;d really be interested in finding out more about that, especially <br/>
since I live in St. Louis!  The problem I&#39;m having getting started in <br/>
homeschool/unschooling my 13 and 10 year olds is their father, my <br/>
ex-husband.  Perhaps if I could get him to learn a little more about <br/>
it, he would be more open to the idea.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks-<br/>
