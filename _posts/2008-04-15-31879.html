Hi Chrissy<br/>
 <br/>
I know I have had the horrible dad award a few times myself.  Nothing makes<br/>
me feel worse then doing something  stupid to make my sons cry, just because<br/>
I was stressed.  Thankfully they have really short memories, even is we<br/>
don&#39;t.<br/>
 <br/>
My wife also travels some for work.  The stress really builds because I<br/>
don&#39;t get any down time.  I have since learned that I really really REALLY<br/>
needed to find a way to release that stress when she is gone.  Part of my<br/>
problem too, was just adjusting to being home and not working.  I was a<br/>
workaholic in my former life.<br/>
 <br/>
Still have trouble believing how things turned out, but I love being home.<br/>
My youngest took his first steps today without support. I got to see that<br/>
and be home for it.  How cool it that!! Okay sorry I digress ;)<br/>
 <br/>
I saw a list like this a while back in one of my wifes parenting magizines<br/>
she reads and it really helped me. Of course the list was geared towards<br/>
stay at home moms and not practical for me so I have developed my own list.<br/>
These are a few things that I do to release some stress<br/>
 <br/>
I hope this helps you some or gives you some ideas.  Hang in there.<br/>
 <br/>
1) I get a time out and we watch Star Trek.<br/>
 <br/>
2) My sister comes for a visit<br/>
 <br/>
3) I play Guitar Hero and they all dance while I play<br/>
 <br/>
4) Video game really really help me calm down, so after the kids go to bed I<br/>
do this first, before doing any work. I will be doing dishes tomorrow anyway<br/>
so its not like they are going there. I am sort of a reformed neat freak.<br/>
Find something that relaxes you.<br/>
 <br/>
5) I once wrote a LONG love letter to my wife and emailed it to her while<br/>
she was on travel.  It was like we were dating all over again and she got a<br/>
big kick out of it.<br/>
 <br/>
6) Watch a Laurie Berkin DVD. Some of the songs have motions or we made some<br/>
up.  We will just dance around and sing.  This is great for bad weather.<br/>
 <br/>
7) We go to the park and I play some basketball while they ride their toys<br/>
around the court. Exercise always helps reduce the stress, but its hard to<br/>
do when I am by myself.<br/>
 <br/>
8) I go move into my mom&#39;s house for a bit sometimes.  I know my friend<br/>
highly recommends this as its the way she copes with having her husband<br/>
gone.<br/>
 <br/>
9) I get some babysitting if nothing else. I trade with another stay at home<br/>
mom. We both get desperate to get out.  I also have a retired friend from<br/>
church who is like a third grandma to my kids who comes over for a few<br/>
hours.  Then I usually hit the coffee shop or Barnes and Nobles for a couple<br/>
of hours.<br/>
 <br/>
10) We have a movie night.  We have been watching  My Neighbor Totoro and<br/>
eating some special snacks.<br/>
 <br/>
Hang in there Chrissy<br/>
 <br/>
Cheers<br/>
Chad<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   How do you do it??? Today I took the award for horrible mom. Just<br/>
&gt; when I was feeling like ok this listening... being mindful, honoring<br/>
&gt; of my children was becoming natural to me as opposed to being<br/>
&gt; something I had to think about.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Not that they whys excuse the actions but Im stressed to the hilt...<br/>
&gt; we are going on the 4th week of hubby working out of state. Im very<br/>
&gt; lucky to have a very involved hands on kinda husband so being alone<br/>
&gt; is a shocker too me. The kids have been awesome, I was a bit afraid<br/>
&gt; of the woo hoo moms all by herself lets mess with her head but its<br/>
&gt; been the exact opposite. Today though I had a total meltdown. Larry<br/>
&gt; had come home sat for the weekend and was less than stellar IMO, the<br/>
&gt; kids were edgy and sensing his and I&#39;s stress over him leaving again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Jacob who is 8 had hugged me at least 20 times finally the 21st time<br/>
&gt; I snapped, I was trying to get something finished that larry needed<br/>
&gt; to leave, and instead of taking the nano second to hug Jacob, I put<br/>
&gt; up my hand to push him away.... that in and of itself is bad enough<br/>
&gt; but when he started crying I Yelled I just dont want to hug you right<br/>
&gt; now.......<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; UGGGGHHHHHH I have cried off and on all day. He of course is over<br/>
&gt; for the most part although since then when he walks up to hug me he<br/>
&gt; has been asking feel like a hug? I have said im sorry to the point<br/>
&gt; where he bluntly told me Im annoying him with it.....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know it just happened today so its very fresh but HOW could I do<br/>
&gt; this???? Sorry I guess this is more of a ramble post!<br/>
