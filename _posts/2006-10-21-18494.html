<div id="ygrps-yiv-1218000908">Next month is National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo)! It&#39;s a  <br/>
challenge started by Chris Baty to produce a 50,000 word novel in  <br/>
just 30 days, starting November 1 and ending midnight November 30.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, it&#39;s insane and yes, it&#39;s a lot of fun :-)<br/>
<br/>
My daughter, Kat (15), and I have done it for the past 2 years.<br/>
<br/>
The great part about NaNoWriMo is that when the goal is to produce  <br/>
words rather than &quot;good writing&quot; then amazingly creative things flow  <br/>
out. Well, a lot of junk too! But when you turn off your inner  <br/>
editor, that little voice that says &quot;No, that&#39;s no good, that won&#39;t  <br/>
work,&quot; you free yourself up to be more creative.<br/>
<br/>
You can plan -- think up a basic story outline -- but no writing  <br/>
until Nov 1. (That&#39;s in 2 Wednesdays.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve done it with no plan 2 years in a row and it&#39;s worked out great.  <br/>
Even had a few hours to spare. ;-) Considering that the novel I&#39;ve  <br/>
been picking at for the last 20 years hasn&#39;t gotten beyond (it&#39;s  <br/>
embarrassing to say ;-) 100,000 words of notes, actually finishing  <br/>
something and seeing the ideas flow without being planned was  <br/>
enlightening to say the least :-)<br/>
<br/>
(When you&#39;re done you upload your work to the Nanowrimo word counter  <br/>
and it automatically counts your words. It&#39;s very generous about what  <br/>
it considers a word. No one reads it. It&#39;s just shear number of words.)<br/>
<br/>
The first year we did it we set our goal at 1700 words per day (which  <br/>
would be 51,000) but some days the writing doesn&#39;t flow as well and  <br/>
some days get very busy (there&#39;s Thanksgiving and preparation in  <br/>
there!) so last year we set our daily goal as 2000 which gave us some  <br/>
generous padding.<br/>
<br/>
Someone asked me last year how much time it takes and I was hesitant  <br/>
to say because for us it&#39;s a lot. *But* I read Chris Baty&#39;s book and  <br/>
he said it takes 1.5 to 2 hours a day on average. *Most* people are  <br/>
doing it while holding jobs or going to school so that&#39;s all the time  <br/>
they can give it. So the answer to how much time is that it will take  <br/>
us much time as you give it, basically! If you give it all day, it  <br/>
takes all day. If you only have 2 hours, it takes 2 hours.<br/>
