<div id="ygrps-yiv-1759501664">Is there a church league? I was unhappy with our neighborhood rec center soccer and t-ball (parents yelling at 4-5 year olds!) My ds started playing at a church and the difference is amazing. At the start of the season he was 12 but placed on high school team and the older kids were great. They took him under their wings and helped him learn! And when parents misbehave they kick them out. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-689050659">You could start your own basketball group. It doesn&#39;t have to be a <br/>
league. Our home school learning center has lots of informal fun sports <br/>
programs of different types led by parents- some are just playing the <br/>
sports, some are more skills and drills. My daughter was interested in <br/>
playing basketball and none of the local programs appealed to her - so I <br/>
asked if anyone would offer a girls basketball program(she prefers this <br/>
to co-ed), and a mom said yes. She led it with her teenaged daughter <br/>
once, and I am helping her this time(and learning!)<br/>
<br/>
My son has been in a Rotary league for years on a team coached by home <br/>
school parents. The rest of the league is school kids. They have lots of <br/>
fun, it is pretty mellow. He played basketball at the Y one winter and <br/>
had a similar experience to that you describe.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-950130529">My point in bringing this up is to ask whether it is ok for my son to<br/>

I think this all depends on your child and what he wants from a sport. <br/>
For you, that means being really clear that it&#39;s about your child, not <br/>
about what you see or get from it.  Much like with TV shows or video <br/>
game choices, sometimes we&#39;re not comfortable with what our kids enjoy <br/>
exploring.   <br/>
<br/>
Dan, our youngest (8 today!), is a born athlete.  He&#39;s played soccer <br/>
for three seasons (currently on winter break) and really enjoys it.  <br/>
He&#39;s a pretty good player, and steadily improving.  He also bikes in <br/>
BMX, where he&#39;s quite good, especially for a kid who competes maybe <br/>
twice a month, and doesn&#39;t really practice between races.  Dan also <br/>
runs like the wind -- it&#39;s what he was born to do.  No track sports <br/>
yet, but he&#39;s young for that still.  <br/>
<br/>
Dan is a true sportsman, and very competitive. Not in an ugly, win-at-<br/>
all-costs way, tho.  Dan understands that if a competition has a <br/>
winner, then there are also folks who don&#39;t win.  Some days you win, <br/>
and some you lose.  Dan truly gets that the point is to do your very <br/>
best, to work with your team and take your lumps. And this seems to be <br/>
something he just innately knew.  <br/>
<br/>
My dh and I aren&#39;t sports fans, or athletes. We&#39;re both bothered by the <br/>
screaming parents in the stands.  We&#39;ve never been ones to <br/>
scream &#39;kick&#39; or &#39;shoot&#39; or &#39;run&#39; during a game. I&#39;ve coached this <br/>
season, so I do sometimes give instructions from the sidelines, but not <br/>
as a Mom.  I&#39;ve asked Dan if he&#39;s prefer we be the screaming supportive <br/>
types, and thankfully he&#39;d rather we just watched without the all the <br/>
drama.  <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s kind of bothered by the screaming parents, but understands that <br/>
some people are just that way. He also knows some kids play sports only <br/>
because their parents insist on it (true for too many kids) and that <br/>
their parents are often the worst screamers.  Last season, he commented <br/>
to me &quot;I think AJ really doesn&#39;t want to play, but since his Dad is <br/>
Coach, he has to.&quot; We talked a bit about that, and Dan knows that all <br/>
the choice are his, not ours.  <br/>
<br/>
Even tho the parents&#39; behavior sometimes bothers me, Dan really enjoys <br/>
sports and the ugly parts don&#39;t taint it for him, so we support him in <br/>
his choice.  For me it&#39;s about trusting that Dan will let us know if <br/>
the overall environment of an activity is no longer working for him. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1874230671">I think with my 8 yo, trusting him to tell me if this situation isn&#39;t working is more difficult that my 5 yo.  My 8 yo is not athletic and not aggressive, but he is a people pleaser, so he doesn&#39;t voice his opinion.  I have talked to him several times (after reading many posts on this message board) that it is completely up to him if he wants to play basketball or ANY sport for that matter.  Before the season, I did explain to him that we really didn&#39;t have the money for him to sign up for this season, but if he wanted to play that daddy would make it happen.  I am afraid that maybe I should have kept my mouth shut because &quot;maybe&quot; he feels he has to keep playing because of the money.  My 5 yo, on the other hand, is like your son - a born athlete.  Everything he plays and touches turns into gold without any effort.  He plays sports because he LOVES them.  <br/>
 <br/>
I really liked the suggestion from another mom of starting my own league, but with 4 little ones, I am not sure I have the energy.  Maybe I could just get other boys together for some pick-up games for my oldest.  That wouldn&#39;t be enough for my 5 yo.  <br/>
 <br/>
I just don&#39;t want his image of sports to be tainted by something, although it may not really be bothering him, maybe just me.  I hadn&#39;t asked him or brought it up because if he hadn&#39;t noticed it before I didn&#39;t want to bring it to his attention.  Should I?  Before being part of this message board, I would never have thought about these issues and would have demanded that he &quot;stick it out&quot; because he had committed to it and we had paid money for it.  Now, I am trying to make sure I help him and give him guidance, while continuing to trust that he will let me know how I can help him.  Wow, is that hard!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-975600565">My oldest, 10, is involved with a few different sports.  There are<br/>
very few homeschoolers here.  He plays on the rec department teams. <br/>
He&#39;s played soccer for a few years now and at first the verbal<br/>
assaults coming from the parents used to really bother me.  I couldn&#39;t<br/>
believe that parents were treating their children that way.  THEN... <br/>
he started wrestling.  I have never seen ANYTHING like it in my ENTIRE<br/>
life.  Youth wrestling is a nightmare for non-competitive types. <br/>
Youth wrestling was more intense then high school wrestling when I<br/>
would go watch my brother, way back in highschool.  I would feel<br/>
justified in saying most parents steer clear of ever allowing their<br/>
child to wrestle.   It really is not a peaceful environment. <br/>
<br/>
I think after the initial shock of it all,  I started to see the other<br/>
parents less and less.  I focused only on my son and his needs and<br/>
wants.  Admittedly, we were lucky to have fabulous coaches,  who<br/>
exemplified sportsmanship and remained positive.  I would say watch<br/>
your son closely, see if he even notices the other parents.  He might<br/>
not.  Focus on him, talk about situations as they arise.  If he is<br/>
noticing, it&#39;s a great opportunity to discuss real life situations and<br/>
how he feels about them.  Overall, my son has had extremely positive<br/>
experiences.<br/>
<br/>
Try not to be afraid to talk to or speak up to the coach if necessary<br/>
and be an example to the other parents.  Sometimes I feel that is is<br/>
necessary to put my &quot;blinders&quot; on in order to support my son exactly<br/>
the way he needs me to.  Good luck!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve been involved in AYSO soccer for 20 years. My husband coaches  <br/>
soccer and in our AYSO region the referees give red cards to the team  <br/>
if a parent yells out anything very negative. If anybody on the  <br/>
sidelines yells out ANYTHING about the refereeing it is an automatic  <br/>
red card to the team. My husband talks to the parents at the first  <br/>
parents&#39; meeting and tells them that HE is the coach and they should  <br/>
absolutely only ever be shouting out encouragement - no criticisms and  <br/>
no coaching at all from the sidelines. My husband is very mild- <br/>
mannered, but if a parent gets out of line, he goes over and asks  <br/>
them, usually jokingly but making the point, &quot;Hey- want the coach&#39;s  <br/>
job?&quot; &lt;G&gt; Another thing is that I take a video camera and start  <br/>
filming from right where the obnoxious parent is (by the way, it is  <br/>
more often a grandfather than anybody else). I say, &quot;Hey, everybody,  <br/>
be on your best behavior, I&#39;m filming this!&quot; Also, the team parent  <br/>
sometimes will hand a lollipop to an offending parent - they get the  <br/>
message. And the region puts up lots of signs and hands out buttons  <br/>
and makes a big point that this is for the kids and what the role of  <br/>
the parents ought to be. It all seems to work well - there are very  <br/>
few problems.<br/>
<br/>
Our region is so great about this that it comes as a complete shock to  <br/>
our kids when they get into playoffs and the other team&#39;s parents are  <br/>
loud and obnoxious.<br/>
