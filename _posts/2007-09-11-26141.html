Before  they left I managed to croak out, &quot;We steer away from philosophies<br/>
that  advocate spanking&quot; which seemed to surprise them a bit but wasn&#39;t<br/>
really  earth-shaking and not a tenth of what I really wanted to say.  <br/>

I picked this sentence out of your whole post because this is how I  approach <br/>
things, lists as well as talking with people in person.  I speak  from where <br/>
I am standing.  I share what we do in our family, how it works  for us, what <br/>
it looks like with our relationships.  If someone is more  interested they will <br/>
ask me to expand, if not that is fine too.  But it  presents how we do things <br/>
in a comfortable manner without offending  anyone.  <br/>
 <br/>
&quot;We steer away from philosophies that advocate spanking.&quot; Lets them know  <br/>
where you are coming from and what you are working with in your family.   But you <br/>
are not demanding that they do things the same way, and you are not  saying <br/>
that they are wrong (which usually turns people off immediately).   But it <br/>
gives them something to think about and an opportunity to ask for more if  they <br/>
would like.  Who knows they may go home and think about it more.   You never <br/>
know who you touch by example.  I think this was a great thing to  say.  I always <br/>
try to come from a place of love and admiration and that  allows for <br/>
connection and sharing.<br/>

Just my thoughts<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1315956887">~~So far, the rules I&#39;ve played by are, &quot;If they bring it up, it&#39;s<br/>
fair game,&quot;and &quot;When in the game, play gently.&quot; (I&#39;m interested in<br/>
getting more people to play, more often.) ~~<br/>
<br/>
I have to admit not playing gently at times.:) When someone does a<br/>
shocking thing to a child right in front of me, I&#39;m more likely to<br/>
bark &quot;HEY, be nice to your kid!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So far, most people ignore that one or look embarrassed. Not so great<br/>
for conversation but at the same time if the public won&#39;t tolerate<br/>
meanness to kids, it will get less acceptable.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve often thought it would be nice to carry a passel of brochures<br/>
that advocate non-spanking or other gentle methods and resources that<br/>
you could simply hand to someone and say &quot;I thought this might be<br/>
something you&#39;d enjoy&quot;. Much less obtrusive.<br/>
<br/>
The place I find it hardest to advocate for children is at work, where<br/>
I have to consider my employment and how customers will react if I say<br/>
something that offends. I try to focus on the child in those instances<br/>
and tell the parents how wonderful their child is. When they respond<br/>
with negatives I simply disagree gently &quot;oh, I bet he&#39;s just<br/>
tired...that&#39;s so normal for that age&quot; or &quot;she&#39;s just letting us know<br/>
what she needs&quot;  or something along those lines.<br/>
