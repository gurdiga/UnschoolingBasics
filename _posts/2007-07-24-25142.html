<div id="ygrps-yiv-1185097038">Kendrah, that was really heartfelt and open and I&#39;m glad you risked your  <br/>
emotions so we could understand more. I really appreciate that. <br/>
 <br/>
My feeling is that your parents would probably have been distant with you  no <br/>
matter if it was pre-TV or not. The vehicle used for their  disengagement of <br/>
you was the TV - almost like with me, food and lack of eating  is a symptom of <br/>
my ED, it&#39;s not that food itself is the issue, but the vehicle  used. Does <br/>
that make any sense? <br/>
 <br/>
I can imagine, the pain and the resentment and I can imagine too, removing  <br/>
something that caused hurt and loneliness, and what came to be a mindlessness  <br/>
type of thing. I can see you also, clearly questioning the situation and <br/>
trying  to work out your personal stuff at the same time. What hard work that is, <br/>
and  that&#39;s a great thing to have happen. Growth, always! <br/>
 <br/>
I, as I said before, LOVE TV, lol. I try to use it thoughtfully, but I also  <br/>
do &quot;gel out&quot; at times :) I enjoy it. I enjoy the discussions it can bring, the <br/>
 topics and the things shown to me that help me question more and more - with <br/>
the  kids and w/o them. I like (to try) being mindful in all my endeavors and <br/>
I like  how TV helps me use critical thinking. <br/>
 <br/>
Again, thanks for discussing that! <br/>
Karen  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-691042258">I think, about the whole TV issue, is that whatever makes a family feel  good <br/>
and whole is probably what&#39;s best for that family :) Enjoy your TV free  <br/>
days! I&#39;m really glad you took the time to discuss it. It helps me to understand  <br/>
a bit the idea of no TV and of so many surrounding issues involving it (and  <br/>
other ways we can become distracted and distant). <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks, Kendrah! <br/>

Many people say the above, what they really mean is &quot;what works for<br/>
the parents&quot;. I realize that isn&#39;t what you&#39;re saying at all, but<br/>
statements like this get bandied about in society as rock solid truth<br/>
and no one really considers that the kids have little to NO voice<br/>
about those choices.<br/>

I agree! I used the word &quot;family&quot; for a reason, because for us (and I hope  <br/>
for others) we really DO decide as equally as possible. My son wants me to help <br/>
 him - if a scary scene comes on, he jams, lol, he is too scared to turn off <br/>
the  TV (he&#39;s 4, almost 5), so by his own choosing, he doesn&#39;t have unlimited <br/>
access  - he knows the stations numbers he likes and he has pretty much free <br/>
access to  the TV. Well, I guess in a sense that IS unlimited, as he decides <br/>
for himself,  huh?)We get into issues when the XBox is desired, or a movie wants <br/>
to be  watched, or some other sort of 2-3 different people wanting to watch <br/>
2-3  different things. That often requires a bit of help in the negotiation, <br/>
but  generally, it&#39;s a fairly smooth issue. My desire to watch Weeds is no more  <br/>
important than my 2 year old&#39;s desire to see Caillou &quot;Food-a-licious&quot; for the <br/>
 16th time ;) So...we make the differences work as best we can...<br/>
 <br/>
Ren, you are REALLY helping me (and Joyce, and Meredith and many others!!!)  <br/>
too think critically. I recently was &quot;challenged&quot; by my mom about my 15 year  <br/>
old&#39;s changing interests in how she wants to use her &quot;high school&quot; years. And  <br/>
much of my discussion regarding this came from my listening to the <br/>
conversations  here. So thank you, all of you, for helping me out! (Oh, and my mom <br/>
laughed, and  bowed out, saying that I made a good argument, lol!)<br/>
 <br/>
(I&#39;ll post up an update on the Teenager Front here - stuff is happening and  <br/>
changing between the 3 older kids of mine, and I have had some hard <br/>
times...just  gearing up for the novel it will be!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1176628295">~~Well, I guess in a sense that IS unlimited, as he decides<br/>

<br/>
Um...yeah.:)<br/>
That&#39;s really the whole point. I don&#39;t feel limited in any way because<br/>
I choose not to watch certain shows or movies. Nobody is telling me<br/>
what I should or shouldn&#39;t watch. Nobody is judging me for my choices.<br/>
I DO have unlimited access yet I choose very carefully what I watch.<br/>
<br/>
Kids will do the same, in a home filled with trust and respect. They<br/>
don&#39;t WANT to watch anything and everything out there. They will each<br/>
choose exactly what is nourishing for them personally, given the<br/>
chance. It will look very different from family to family and person<br/>
to person. What bothers me makes others laugh.<br/>
What enchants me, may bore others. <br/>
<br/>
Around here, I have a 17 y.o. that rarely ever watches tv even though<br/>
he has one in his room. I have a 13y.o. that watches certain shows<br/>
religiously every week, only his favorites and rarely anything else<br/>
and he also has a tv in his room.<br/>
<br/>
Dh and I only watch shows occasionally, I&#39;m more likely to watch what<br/>
someone else already has on. Ciara and Jalen (10 and 6) love Cartoon<br/>
Network and have several favorites there. They probably watch more<br/>
than anyone else in the house.  They are more excited by a trip to the<br/>
Farmer&#39;s Market or a walk in the rain or picking blackberries than<br/>
anything on tv usually! Oh, they have a tv in each of their rooms AND<br/>
my room which they have access to at all times (they sleep with us). <br/>
<br/>
We are a technology rich household really. We actually own every game<br/>
system since n64 came out other than the new Wii and PS3. Even with<br/>
all of that, they&#39;re more likely to play WoW than watch tv.:)<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ve learned from all the tv and video games just like everything<br/>
else in our lives. Having those doesn&#39;t negate all the other wonderful<br/>
activities we choose. <br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;m off on a tangent again. Not even answering your post really,<br/>
I&#39;m thinking more about the other post about power tools and tv!<br/>
That&#39;s what happens when I get writing.<br/>
<br/>
The point is, all the information about tv makes it sound like one<br/>
must choose tv OR a rich active life. One can have both. We do. It&#39;s<br/>
all part of unschooling. It&#39;s all part of learning and exploration. I<br/>
don&#39;t need to control their choices, I need to embrace them.<br/>
