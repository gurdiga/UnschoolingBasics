<div id="ygrps-yiv-686975368">Okay... Just throwing this out there because I&#39;m having some strange <br/>
thoughts lately regarding my marriage and don&#39;t want to feel &quot;stuck&quot; in it <br/>
simply because we have a child together (I personally don&#39;t think it&#39;s <br/>
healthy to have a poor mom-dad relationship as a model)...<br/>
<br/>
At the risk of appearing to be asking for life advice, I&#39;m throwing this out <br/>
there...<br/>
<br/>
Are there any possibilities for continuing to unschool with <br/>
separated/divorced parents? I&#39;m thinking of some options (whereby I would <br/>
still take care of my son during the day and he would be with dad at night <br/>
and we could alternate being with him on the weekends, etc., etc.) but I&#39;m <br/>
wondering if any of you have successfully mixed families and/or split <br/>
families while still helping your child/ren along the transition as smoothly <br/>
as possible.<br/>
<br/>
**Nothing has happened yet. It&#39;s all still in my head and is the strangest <br/>
set of thoughts I have ever had. I&#39;d like any responses to focus on <br/>
maintaining the well-being of the child (2.5 years old) - if any of you have <br/>
been through this, was there any fall-out? Dad and I are not fighting and <br/>
really have no disharmony in the house whatsoever. It&#39;s all happening inside <br/>
me...<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the strangely vague post. Having a weird night and a million <br/>
thoughts bouncing around my head. Thanks for any wisdom.<br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s also the possibility you&#39;ll get hit by a meteor. Perhaps the  <br/>
possibilities are nearly equal.<br/>
<br/>
I think what&#39;s useful is to picture the worst (and far more likely)  <br/>
scenario where you need to deal with an ex-spouse who is angry and  <br/>
uncooperative because he&#39;s hurt, a new wife who disagrees with every  <br/>
philosophy you hold dear and wants to undermine everything you try to  <br/>
do to punish you for having hurt the man she loves, a job to support  <br/>
yourself that pays too little and takes too many hours so you can&#39;t  <br/>
be with your child during the day and are too tired when you can, and  <br/>
a judge that orders the child be placed in school.<br/>
<br/>
*Is* that better than what you have right now?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-221174269">I just wanted to comment on this paragraph. From my observations, in  <br/>
our family and in those of my friends, it&#39;s very very common for  <br/>
people to feel this way at some point in their marriage. The &#39;seven  <br/>
year&#39; itch may not go on that time period, but it&#39;s a fact that they  <br/>
occur. Let&#39;s see, quote &quot;The first decline, Kurdek says, is probably  <br/>
a normal adjustment to new roles; the second decline is often related  <br/>
to the birth of children. Couples experiencing the seven year itch  <br/>
disagree with each other more, become less affectionate, share fewer  <br/>
activities, and express overall dissatisfaction with their marriages,  <br/>
says Kurdek, whose study was published in the September 1999 issue of  <br/>
the journal Developmental Psychology.&quot; unquote. I wanted to say that  <br/>
up front, just because it seems to be an issue hardly ever addressed,  <br/>
and I would dislike to see anyone make a huge life change based on  <br/>
odd emotions that they think are unusual (or unacceptable). It wasn&#39;t  <br/>
that long ago when I looked at my husband one day and had no idea who  <br/>
he was, even his appearances seemed foreign to me. It would have been  <br/>
(relatively) easy emotionally to leave him right then (and I say  <br/>
relative because I knew that life after divorce is very hard, and  <br/>
because emotions change, and I&#39;d have kids who were struggling).<br/>
<br/>
As a child of divorced parents, I can assure you there is a lot of  <br/>
fall-out. As Ren mentioned your husband may feel betrayed and  <br/>
deserted. Your son may grow up wondering (no matter how amicable) if  <br/>
it was something he did. You may regret it some day, but the  <br/>
relationship with your husband will never be the same. There are new  <br/>
people on each side of the equation, and everyone needs something.  <br/>
There are new houses for your son to adjust to, there are friends who  <br/>
feel like they have to choose sides, there are inlaws you may lose  <br/>
the friendship of. Just me saying to my husband some of the things I  <br/>
was thinking, changed our relationship (and not for the better  <br/>
initially). We&#39;ve spent the better part of the six months courting  <br/>
each other again and trying to build a new connection. And in  <br/>
hindsight, it&#39;s funny to me, because what it took was putting the  <br/>
same attention to my husband and my marriage as I do the kids. It&#39;s  <br/>
quite easy, when the kids are young, to legitimize putting all your  <br/>
attention and energy on them, but marriage is like a young child too.  <br/>
The L&L conference was rather like a honeymoon for us, to celebrate  <br/>
rebuilding our relationship, and our new lives as unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
I think Sandra was the one who mentioned abusive relationships. I  <br/>
would never say to stick it out to someone who was in a violent  <br/>
relationship and therapy was not an option. But I would encourage you  <br/>
to look at why you are having strange thoughts, what exactly your  <br/>
heart is asking for, and try to figure out how to get it from your  <br/>
husband. Give HIM what you need, and trust that it will come back to  <br/>
you, because if you&#39;re feeling this way, he&#39;s probably picking up on it.<br/>
<br/>
And this got longer than I thought. Sorry!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I used to think not, but that was when my children were much younger<br/>
and I was fairly new to home and unschooling.  Now that I am older :-)<br/>
 I can see how different scenarios would have worked for me to have<br/>
protected my children from that horrible year of schooling that they<br/>
did when their father and I were living seperately.<br/>
<br/>
My story and situation:  I am a &quot;happily divorced&quot; lesbian living with<br/>
her ex-husband and best friend (one in the same).  We seperated and<br/>
divorced 3 years ago when we were trying to figure out our identities<br/>
in the face of my coming out and he was not dealing well with my (now<br/>
ex) girlfriend.  That lasted for a whole 6 months when we realized<br/>
that neither of us wanted to be the &quot;every other weekend parent.&quot;  We<br/>
were also spending a lot of time together because we wanted to both be<br/>
involved in our children&#39;s lives.  He would come over every weekend to<br/>
do laundry (I took the washer and dryer) and have dinner with us or<br/>
come over for some activity that was happening at the kids&#39; school or<br/>
some other function that we were doing (art fairs, music concerts,<br/>
days at the beach, etc.)  Finally we realized that we were paying<br/>
twice the rent, twice the utilities and twice the insurance, so we<br/>
bought a house together with 5 bedrooms (one for each person) and have<br/>
lived this way for 2.5 years.  I think the important thing is that we<br/>
*are* friends and care deeply for each other and each other&#39;s<br/>
welfares.  We both want to be involved in the children&#39;s lives and we<br/>
both know that co-habitating allows us to better meet the needs of our<br/>
unschooling children.  We also both know that as the kids get older<br/>
that we may decide to move on.  The other thing that we agreed on was<br/>
that we didn&#39;t want other people to tear this odd little family apart.<br/>
  That whoever we met that we wanted to have a relationship with would<br/>
have to be absorbable into this family not divide this family up (at<br/>
least for now).  A while back Dan was dating someone seriously and we<br/>
talked about her moving in.  When she realized that we were serious<br/>
that Dan wouldn&#39;t be moving out nor would I she just couldn&#39;t come to<br/>
terms with sharing a home with another female, so they broke up.<br/>
<br/>
When we first started this venture we felt like we were the only ones<br/>
that were in this unique situation, but since then we have met others<br/>
who have similar stories.  For whatever reasons lovers fell out of<br/>
love, but not with their children and their desire to be active and<br/>
participating parents was important enough for them to divorce and<br/>
still live together for the children.  I think it really helps<br/>
(especially in our situation) to have that divorce (although legally<br/>
we remarried so I could be added back on his insurance as his company<br/>
does not provide for domestic partner benefits and it eased all the<br/>
issues about end of life questions and other legal issues - but to us<br/>
it is just a piece of paper saying that it gives us those legal<br/>
issues, it isn&#39;t a marriage, just a co-parentship :)  )  OK, it is<br/>
strange, but it works for us because we want it to.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully you can find peace in your relationship in one way or<br/>
another.  I know now that if something were to happen to  Dan and he<br/>
either went bonkers and left or died that I would be able to continue<br/>
unschooling without him.  In fact I think it would be better and<br/>
easier on the children than being thrust into such an unhealthy<br/>
environment that the public schools have to offer.<br/>

<br/>
**Michelle, your post gives me hope. Yes, I am having strange feelings and <br/>
thoughts of &quot;throwing it all away&quot; but I should mention that they didn&#39;t <br/>
just start yesterday. In fact, I think I&#39;ve let them go on for too long. We <br/>
have been together for 15 years and I think it might have been over before <br/>
we decided to have our son, I&#39;m sad to say.<br/>
<br/>
I am trying to keep this less about the marriage, though, and more about the <br/>
unschooling possibilities since I would like to try and stay as on-topic as <br/>
possible for the benefits of the list.<br/>
<br/>
I like your tale of your &quot;odd&quot; little family. There are ways it can work, I <br/>
think, as long as the parents stay mature and keep focused on the benefits <br/>
of the child/ren. My husband is a great husband and he&#39;s a wonderful father <br/>
devoted to unschooling. It&#39;s just that he would be a great husband for <br/>
someone else. I am very confident that he would work with me on a scenario <br/>
that could allow us to still unschool and keep our son as happy as possible. <br/>
I think it doesn&#39;t have to be so black and white. Of course, I haven&#39;t <br/>
spoken about this with him so I have no idea how he will react or how mature <br/>
he will want to be... Thanks for your story.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, do be careful!  I&#39;ve been amazed at how &quot;weird&quot; some men get when<br/>
faced with divorce.  I&#39;ve had 3 friends in the past 5 years who have<br/>
divorced their husbands, who I found to be logical, intelligent, and<br/>
thoughtful husbands turn into vindictive, angry, illogical @$$es when<br/>
asked for divorces.  I did have one friend who divorced who was<br/>
homeschooling and her now ex was at least supportive of their children<br/>
continuing to homeschool.  They worked through their divorce through<br/>
an mediator rather than going at it with the courts.  They agreed to<br/>
certain things so that when they did go in front of the judge for the<br/>
final decree they were seen as parents who were working together and<br/>
in agreement rather than fighting about nit picky little things.  You<br/>
would have to know how your dh would hand it.  Un/homeschooling can<br/>
continue *if* the other parent will still be cooperative.  I had<br/>
another friend who lost the right to homeschool even though her ex was<br/>
supportive when they were married.  When they divorced he suddenly was<br/>
opposed to homeschooling.  Not because he truly opposed it but it was<br/>
his way to be vindictive.  :(  It was all about him and not about the<br/>
children.  :((((((<br/>

I loved hearing your story.  Me and my husband are not<br/>
divorced, but I love to see how unschooling works with<br/>
other families.  It is really neat that you and your<br/>
ex-hubby found a way to make things work for<br/>
yourselves and your kids.  Good luck to both of you.<br/>
