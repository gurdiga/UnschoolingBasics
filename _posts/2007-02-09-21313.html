&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yeah, I&#39;d use a different name.&lt;g&gt; I encourage you to start a list for<br/>
&gt; single struggling moms, yes. But I caution that sometimes, as comforting<br/>
&gt; as a support list might be, it has the potential to become one more excuse<br/>
&gt; for not making real changes in ourselves and in our lives that will move <br/>
&gt; us<br/>
&gt; in a positive direction. There&#39;s danger in commiseration in that it often<br/>
&gt; closes the door on progress toward something better. Sometimes, as much as<br/>
&gt; we want to hear someone confirm that life sucks, it&#39;s better for our kids <br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; have someone say to us, &quot;GET UP and DO something about it.&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I really really want to know where this philosphical tenet comes from.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Reading through Deb&#39;s response to this I realized I wanted to address this.<br/>
<br/>
I can clearly remember hanging out with my friends and bitching about men, <br/>
all men in general and the ones we were dating in specific. And it was huge <br/>
these bitch fests, with everything up for conversational grabs. And it meant <br/>
that we were looking for details to bitch about, to be funny about, to win <br/>
at the most dysfunctional relationship. I made a concerted effort at some <br/>
point early on with David to not bitch about him. Not because he was any <br/>
more or less bitchable about, but because the bitching and whining didn&#39;t <br/>
help me to look at our relationship as a good and positive thing. I don&#39;t <br/>
know if that made the difference in my marriage to David, but it certainly <br/>
helped. When I think about, for example, laundry as a never ending burden, <br/>
it becomes insurmountable. But, if instead, I put the laundry in the wash <br/>
and then hang it out to dry while watching the cat bound around down the <br/>
garden hoping this time the pigeon won&#39;t fly away and bring in the clothes <br/>
to hang and fold while watching a cool show in the living room, it is just a <br/>
part of life.<br/>
<br/>
I think falling into the habit of moaning about a life is an easy thing to <br/>
do. If I chose to look at Simon&#39;s or Linnaea&#39;s requests for things as a <br/>
tally card, instead of individual requests, I could get quite bitchy. If I <br/>
came to this list, or any of the other lists that I&#39;m on, and started <br/>
whining about how Simon stays in his sleeping bag all day and he always <br/>
watches television and how Linnaea is always playing on the computer and <br/>
they never do anything--none of which is true, but I could argue from that <br/>
perspective--it would be a disservice to me and to them if I were told that <br/>
yes, children can be like that. I expect this list, I want this list to tell <br/>
me to change my perspective. To tell me to be with Simon and Linnaea while <br/>
they do what they are doing and see if that is all they are doing. I don&#39;t <br/>
want any arena of my life to help me piss and moan about my life. I want to <br/>
be able to see the good moments in a day, and not wallow in the bad. I want <br/>
to go from strength to strength and not relish my weak moments for their <br/>
storytelling potential. Not to say that is what is happening, but I know I <br/>
have done that, and when I go to homeschooling groups and listen to moms <br/>
belittle their children for a laugh it seems a poor trade.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t make anyone else&#39;s past better. But maybe by offering them tools to <br/>
make this moment a better moment I can help them to see a way forward. And I <br/>
think dwelling on the bad things, the ones we&#39;ve done, or the ones done to <br/>
us, can blind us to the ways to make this moment a good moment.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve done this too.  It&#39;s so easy to complain and wish things were <br/>
better, instead of living more in the moment.  For me, until I <br/>
stopped working 2 years ago, it was even harder when I was rushing <br/>
around.<br/>

<br/>
We all have something in our past that we wish had never happened, or <br/>
that we wish we could change, but we can&#39;t.  It&#39;s hard to move on <br/>
and &quot;get over it&quot; and this has been a long struggle for me, but I can <br/>
honestly say it was a battle I&#39;m glad I persisted at, for I&#39;m in a <br/>
much better place now than I was even 2 years ago when I pulled my dd <br/>
out of school.   And she has come so far.  At first I had my doubts <br/>
about unschooling, but the battle was mine and I let her &quot;be&quot;, let <br/>
her heal.  I&#39;ve been thinking about that a lot this week, she has <br/>
been talking a lot about herself, what&#39;s important to her, how she <br/>
feels about many things that I think more &quot;traditional&quot; parents would <br/>
never hear from their teens.  I respect her as a person, and she <br/>
knows that I WANT to hear what she has to say, even when I&#39;m really <br/>
tired and ready to drop, I see that the effort I&#39;ve made to be really <br/>
present for her when she&#39;s &quot;on a roll&quot; which is often late at night <br/>
when I&#39;m SO ready to sleep, has paid off big time.  <br/>

(I loved your description of Linnaea in your Warts and All post on <br/>
your blog, made me think of the time someone said my dd (Danielle 14) <br/>
was an old soul.)</div>
