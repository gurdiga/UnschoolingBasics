<div id="ygrps-yiv-759508443">We may be moving to rural Southwestern Wisconsin in six months to a year.  My inlaws have purchased an 1880&#39;s era hotel/bed and breakfast with a restaurant and will move out in June to start the restoration process.  We hope to follow when we figure out what to do for income there.  (I had planned to apply for graduate programs in Madison, but I&#39;m not sure I can do that while unschooling.)<br/>
<br/>
The nearest larger population centers are Dubuque, IA, and Madison, WI.  I was wondering if anyone knew about unschooling/homeschooling communities in the area.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-922610270">Oh what an adventure to go on! That sounds like it will be such a blast. Ok, so I love old houses and the idea of having a bed and breakfast in one is awesome. It is something that we have discussed doing as well, actually recreating a &quot;period&quot; farm type of thing. Buying an old homestead and turning it into a working piece of history. I would love to know how it all goes for you. :)<br/>

If you&#39;re really thinking about a regional conference, you might want to contact Alex in MN: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:polykowholsteins@...">polykowholsteins@...</a><br/>

Give her a couple days, though, she just stepped on her laptop!<br/>
