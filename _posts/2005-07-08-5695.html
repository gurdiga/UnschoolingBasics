<div id="ygrps-yiv-2007119183">There are a few new things up on the site: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://liveandlearnconference.org">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a> ----and more coming in every few days.<br/>
<br/>
Also a few changes and corrections. (If y&#39;all see any mistakes, please <br/>
let me know!)<br/>
<br/>
The overflow hotel is the Drury Inn. We have 60 rooms blocked right <br/>
now, and they will add more as we need them. (There are a few <br/>
suites!---but HURRY!) Rooms must be booked by September 17 to get the <br/>
special rate of $89!<br/>
<br/>
I want to remind folks about the raffle and the new &quot;Hometown Baskets&quot; <br/>
silent auction.<br/>
<br/>
We have a special guest: Share Faeber is a caricaturist---take home a <br/>
little momento of the conference! Only $7 per!<br/>
<br/>
Be sure to take a peek at the City Museum (www.citymuseum.org)---it&#39;s <br/>
our Saturday night excursion! An organic museum that changes <br/>
daily----truly amazing! I was there last week and was BLOWN AWAY!!!<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve been considering offering a funshop---now&#39;s the time to step <br/>
up. I have a very few slots left, but I need to fill them. Let me know <br/>
asap!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sending confirmations out as they come in now, so if you have sent <br/>
me your registration and haven&#39;t received a confirmation, holler at <br/>
me!!! I&#39;ve found two in my spam folder! (I check there every day now!)<br/>
<br/>
*****Most importantly: the Early Bird Deadline is July 31!!! PLEASE be <br/>
sure to send your registrations in before the 31!!! That&#39;s the end of <br/>
THIS month!!!*******<br/>
<br/>
Please feel free to forward this one to other groups.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much!<br/>
<br/>
Now, back to your regularly scheduled unschooling discussion....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-135866619">How&#39;s Ren doing--has anyone heard? Is she back from Alaska yet even?<br/>
<br/>
My mom (who lives in Gulf Shores, AL) is up visiting, but it seems they <br/>
were spared this time around. All the folks in Pensacola are in my <br/>
thoughts. I&#39;m hoping they got spared being on the west of the hurricane <br/>
this time around.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1736136187">I don&#39;t know how much info Ren would like spread, so I&#39;ll let her write <br/>
when she has time. But...<br/>
<br/>
She and her kids are back from Alaska. I talked with her Thursday. Her <br/>
computer&#39;s dead, so she goes to the library. They left Friday for upper <br/>
Alabama to stay with friends until the storm blows over.They may be <br/>
travelling further up to TN for a night or two. I invited them here if <br/>
they need to.<br/>
<br/>
She has little hope for the Pensacola area. I hope she&#39;ll be pleasantly <br/>
surprised.<br/>
