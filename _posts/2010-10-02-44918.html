<div id="ygrps-yiv-846372377">Hey folks, I just went through and deleted or rejected a bunch of pending messages looking for local info so I want to post a couple better places for people to look for that kind of thing. Because this is an international list, its not a good place to ask about local laws and procedures. It is a good place to ask about the details of how whole life unschooling really works. Thanks y&#39;all. <br/>
