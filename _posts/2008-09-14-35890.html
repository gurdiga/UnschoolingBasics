<div id="ygrps-yiv-790945733">At the RE conference, one of the speakers had written a book called &quot;Find a Tree&quot;  Basically, he&#39;d been to Africa & befriended a set of twin brothers who dreamed of having a school to teach the village kids how to read.  Daniel&#39;s advice to them was &quot;don&#39;t wait for a school, just find a tree and get started.  A year later, they had over 100 students and a building had been donated to them.  <br/>
<br/>
In his class, we did an exercise to help us find and follow our own dreams.  The first thing we did was to list our top 20 talents and interests.  In the class, it took us adults over 1/2 and hour, some prodding and discussion to list twenty.  At home, after the conference, all of my kids knocked theirs out in as much time as it took them to print the words.  My 11 yr old spent all of 8 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
On his website, there are exercises, like the one we did, to help you find & follow your dreams.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Being in a group environment really helped because we were able to make suggestions to one another and offer encouragement and advice.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, I think that when our kids see us following our dreams with a passion, it&#39;s probably the best education.  It&#39;s kind of hard to be a quitter when little eyes are waiting for your next intelligent move.  My husband and I are dream followers, I am a stay-home mom and freelance writer, he&#39;s an independent filmmaker.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever lost any passions, but sometimes I like to <br/>
dabble in something new - try something just for the heck of it. I <br/>
don&#39;t go in with any kind of expectation that it will become a new <br/>
hobby or passion, just dabbling. Sometimes that dabbling will <br/>
develop into a passion, sometimes it will unexpectedly dovetail with <br/>
an existing passion. Other times it becomes one of the many things <br/>
I&#39;ve tried over the years. Origami and flower arranging and cross <br/>
stitch and cheese making. <br/>
<br/>
The wonderful thing about dabbling is that you never know when you <br/>
might draw on that fleeting experience. My job, casting plaster <br/>
architectural details, uses my cheese making experience, but I <br/>
certainly didn&#39;t go into making cheese with that kind of <br/>
expectation. It was fun, and my cheese making buddy always had a <br/>
bottle of wine to share.... <br/>
<br/>
For some people, dabbling itself is a passion. That can *look* like <br/>
a person who never seems able to &quot;stick&quot; to something - but some of <br/>
our most famous thinkers and inventors have been confirmed dabblers. <br/>
<br/>
So dabble away and don&#39;t worry about the passion part. That will <br/>
come naturally.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1334428505">Some of mine, besides cooking *wink*, are writing, reading, learning, gardening. I had to sit and think long and hard about things that I enjoy doing, things that got my mind racing and made me excited. Those 5 things are pretty basic, one of my passions is my family. I am also very into natural living, not just organics, recycling, etc but living as naturally as possible. It is better for me and for my family.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1437034939">Oh I like your take on dabbling.  My dad and I are the masters of unfinished<br/>
projects and we love to dabble.  He&#39;s made carpentry into a full time<br/>
passion over the years and now it&#39;s bow and arrow making (a carpentry craft<br/>
itself).  He has always said he was a jack of all trades, master of none.  I<br/>
beg to differ on the &quot;master of none&quot; part but I see his point about the<br/>
other.  ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-319252462">My work I do for money, which pays for kid&#39;s activities outside the <br/>
home, computer games, lessons, clothing, books, and sometimes the bills- <br/>
is very interesting to me. This is something that fell into my lap, so I <br/>
can&#39;t recommend a process beyond envisioning what you love and waiting <br/>
for it to appear,&lt;g&gt;. I work for my dad&#39;s company, which distributes <br/>
labels to grower, mostly natural and organic growers for all kinds of <br/>
products, as a free-lance graphic designer and illustrator. It is fun, <br/>
and I feel good about the contribution we are making to the organic <br/>
farming movement as we help the farmers quite a bit with complying with <br/>
labeling laws and successful marketing. I did get a degree in this many <br/>
years ago, and my dad happened to need some help 4-5 years ago.<br/>
<br/>
Also there are a couple of things that I do with my kids, or that are <br/>
spin offs from things they are into that have become passions for me. <br/>
Beading, which I do with my daughter- we have spent many glorious hours <br/>
together. Music- listening and learning about musicians and music <br/>
theory. My son&#39;s passion is playing the bass. I have been blessed with a <br/>
new and deeper appreciation of music and how much it can touch people.<br/>
<br/>
Also I am pretty passionate about helping my kids- which is convenient, <br/>
because they want my help! This involves things like helping to start a <br/>
learning center with rented space and 5 days a week of activities for <br/>
home schooled kids- this I spent a lot of time on for a couple years, <br/>
and got to know a lot of people; learning more and more about myself and <br/>
how I want to be with my kids, which in turn has improved all my <br/>
relationships, especially the one with myself; looking into <br/>
opportunities for them; and telling people about the totally awesome <br/>
things my kids are doing lately!<br/>
<br/>
None of this was selected intentionally, it just happens as you open up <br/>
to what life brings.<br/>

&shy;  I need more passions. Anyone have<br/>
tips or experience to share about finding  their passions after loosing them<br/>
for a long time?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
____<br/>
I can really relate to this and it&#39;s something I&#39;m continually working  on.  <br/>
My passion for years was just doing what my kids were doing and  helping them <br/>
discover and broaden their interests.  Along the way, my  passions became what <br/>
my kids loved doing.  Not a bad thing (because I  was enjoying it)  but as I <br/>
looked around at other unschooling parents, I  realized they were also <br/>
pursuing personal interests that were&#39;nt  necessarily shared by their kids.  I had <br/>
been busy working and  parenting and just hadn&#39;t considered much else.<br/>
 <br/>
So, I just started looking around at what my friends (both young and  old) <br/>
were doing and if something interested me, I tried it. I noticed at  that point <br/>
that it was my unschooling friends who had the most varied  interests. <br/>
 <br/>
 This has led to a host of things such as getting  chickens (don&#39;t have them <br/>
any more...long story..&lt;g&gt;), playing the  guitar, jewelry making, gardening, <br/>
new recipes, beekeeping,  Zumba, cycling, art projects (check out the <br/>
Imagination Tribe yahoo  group), blogging, yoga, weight training and making pottery.<br/>
 <br/>
 My recommendation is to hang around someone like Kelly Lovejoy...or  Ren <br/>
Allen....or read some of the interests of some of the unschoolers on this  list <br/>
and just give it a try. You may try something for a day or a month or  it could <br/>
turn into a lifetime passion.  My kids are just as supportive  about some of <br/>
my passions as I am about theirs and we find ways for us to pursue  them.<br/>
 <br/>
I think the biggest thing for me was realizing that I could try anything I  <br/>
wanted and not worry about what it might or might not turn in to.  I&#39;m  going <br/>
Kayaking next week for the first time in my life.  It could be a one  time <br/>
thing....or maybe we&#39;ll buy kayaks and do it every weekend.  Either  way, it&#39;s all <br/>
good.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-668339073">4-5 families, all of whom I would say school at home, formed a <br/>
non-profit about 4 years ago. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://nllchs.org/">http://nllchs.org/</a> It is run by a board. <br/>
They rent a space and make the rules and set up a structure. Each family <br/>
that wants to participate is required to lead a program or help in some <br/>
way- administration or cleaning or something, and also pays $100 per <br/>
session towards rent and insurance. We have part time use of a gym and <br/>
conference room, and full time use of an office suite, with 1 larger and <br/>
2 small rooms. There is a public playground next to the building. A few <br/>
families, including myself in the past, have invested a HUGE amount of <br/>
time in setting this up. The responsibility is rotating around somewhat <br/>
now, with only 2 of the original 5 board members. We have a great <br/>
database interface that a member has set up, and there are 3 8-10 week <br/>
sessions of jam packed 5 plus days a weeks, full days of programming for <br/>
school aged home schooled kids. in between sessions there are a few <br/>
other things going on, though not much. The programming varies- this <br/>
session my kids signed up for basketball, biology, anime club, girls <br/>
club(which I organize as my contribution), drawing, desserts, and Friday <br/>
field trips. Many families treat it like school, and try to pick a class <br/>
in each schooly subject area. We say pooh to that, and do what we feel <br/>
like- the kids have really loved it at times, though aren&#39;t so excited <br/>
right now. My son is way busy with music so doesn&#39;t have much time for <br/>
it. I can&#39;t help thinking everyday how much more awesome it would be if <br/>
there were even a few more radical unschoolers around- I feel really <br/>
strange being around so many school at home parents- big disconnect, <br/>
which is why I am not so involved anymore. There are lots of different <br/>
interesting things to do there, and people tend to get along well. It is <br/>
really a great thing, but as I said - took a ridiculous amount of energy <br/>
and commitment to get off the ground. There are also insurance and <br/>
supervision issues that cause a lot of stress.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-84165931">Hi Zoa,<br/>
<br/>
For many years, work was my first passion (excluding my DH of course) <br/>
&lt;g&gt; and going to school was my second passion. Lately, as a SAHM, I <br/>
have been feeling adrift. I&#39;ve never had so much time for my <br/>
interests, although the time comes unpredictably during the day. Like <br/>
you, I&#39;ve been trying to discover new interests to enjoy in these <br/>
moments. Right now I need hobbies that I can start and stop fairly <br/>
quickly. I have some existing interests (music) that I am <br/>
reinvigorating. I also have been dabbling in new areas as was <br/>
mentioned by other respondents. Below is an idea of how I came to <br/>
dabble in some of these interests.<br/>
<br/>
For L&L I decided to make aprons for my passion baskets. That was the <br/>
first sewing I&#39;ve done since high school. Since those came out OK, I <br/>
decided to make the boys&#39; pirate costumes for the masquerade ball. <br/>
They turned out OK, so now I want to make some dress up clothes for <br/>
the boys. And for some bizarre reason, I want to make beanbags... <br/>
lots of beanbags.<br/>
<br/>
You mentioned cooking. I&#39;ve become interested in making food more <br/>
flavorful, so I&#39;m spending some time learning more about herbs and <br/>
spices. Last year at Christmas, I made spice mixes for gifts for the <br/>
adults who don&#39;t need any more &quot;stuff.&quot; Based on positive feedback, <br/>
I&#39;ll do that again this year.<br/>
<br/>
One of my favorite childhood memories was when my mom let us choose a <br/>
birthday cake from a book she had and then she would make it: <br/>
baseball mitt, castle, humpty dumpty, etc. So I decided to do that <br/>
for the boys and that led to an interest in decorating with icing.<br/>
<br/>
Lately, I have been trying to remember interests that I couldn&#39;t <br/>
afford when I was younger, or that I didn&#39;t want to invest the time <br/>
to explore when I was working/studying. These include painting, <br/>
writing, drumming, learning Spanish, and learning sign language. <br/>
These are on my short list of interests to pursue. I also have a <br/>
bookshelf full of classic books and biographies that I want to read. <br/>
Finally, I decided that I want to share a hobby with my DH, so I am <br/>
thinking of learning to fly fish. (If I don&#39;t like the fishing part, <br/>
I might like the creative aspect of fly tying....)<br/>
<br/>
So, my journey to finding more &quot;passions&quot; involved dabbling in new <br/>
interests that support our current life (sewing, spices, icing), <br/>
reflecting on unfulfilled interests from earlier times, and finding <br/>
an interest to share with my DH. <br/>
<br/>
Cheers!<br/>
<br/>
Lisa<br/>

One of the things I brought back from the L&L in my head is the idea <br/>
that in<br/>
order to encourage and foster our children following their passions, we <br/>
need<br/>
to follow our own. For me though, it has been along time since I felt I <br/>
had<br/>
the time to follow a true passion, I am kind of out of practice. I seem <br/>
to<br/>
only be following the passions that are easy or that ³fit in² with my <br/>
past<br/>
ideas of what a ³good² mom should be doing. Cooking is the strongest<br/>
example. I love it and doing it makes me feel that I am showing love <br/>
for my<br/>
family. Win-win. But it is insufficient ­ I need more passions. Anyone <br/>
have<br/>
tips or experience to share about finding their passions after loosing <br/>
them<br/>
for a long time?<br/>
<br/>
-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
I never really *lost* my desire to try new things. But I make a <br/>
concerted effort to find new things all the time.<br/>
<br/>
We have a &quot;Vision Board&quot; or &quot;Dream Board&quot; on our kitchen wall. Each of <br/>
us writes down things we want to do/try/see/experience---both soon and <br/>
in the more distant future. It can be ANYTHING---wild and crazy and <br/>
hair-brained---or simple and plain. But writing it down seems to help <br/>
&quot;make it real.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
On the board now, we have<br/>
Kelly: landscape front yard, make my own cheese, grow mushrooms, build <br/>
chicken yard, kayak, Great Wall, knit socks, Machu Picchu<br/>
Ben: Burning Man<br/>
, Portland, Alaska, skydive<br/>
Duncan: get a Weimaraner, Japan, California, laptop<br/>
Cameron: kayak, perform Thriller @ L&L, Greece with family, WOOF, learn <br/>
a language, Burning Man<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve already crossed kayaking, skydiving, new laptop, and performing <br/>
Thriller off the list. &lt;G&gt; And we ALL did all of them---except Dunc <br/>
didn&#39;t get to skydive because he was under 18! :-(<br/>
<br/>
I bought a book and supplies to make cheese. I&#39;ve looked at websites <br/>
for growing mushrooms. I have plans drawn up for the chicken yard <br/>
(we&#39;ll build it in November when Cameron comes home from Mexico <br/>
---learn a language), and I have researched and picked out the breed of <br/>
chickens I want (Wyandottes). We went kayaking for my birthday AND last <br/>
weekend. Walking on the Great Wall and at Mach Picchu will have to <br/>
wait. &lt;G&gt; Socks? I&#39;ll get around to it. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
SO...my suggestion would be to make a list---a very, very long list of <br/>
everything you have ever wanted to do that you haven&#39;t been able to <br/>
do---and everything you now want to do. Write it down. Let others know <br/>
that these things are on your list.<br/>
<br/>
Then PICK one. Do THAT ONE THING. Celebrate it!<br/>
<br/>
Then pick another. And another. Lather, rinse, repeat. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Ooh, I actually got a little tingle when I read this.  I can relate to the OP, in that a long time ago I went so undergound that it&#39;s taking a long time for those things to make themselves known to me again.  And I so want to be the mom who really loves to try new things and is passionate about life and learning.  A baby step: I realized the other day while I was in Michaels buying some items for Ryan, that I have wanted to learn to knit/crochet for a long time.  So I bought a crochet hook, a ball of pretty yarn, and a beginner book.  It was FUN!<br/>
 <br/>
I loved your list Katherine!  And Kelly, I LOVE the idea of a dream board in our kitchen, I&#39;m going to hustle out tomorrow and buy some bristol board and hang it up.  Hmmm...the possibilites...<br/>
 <br/>
I was so sad to have had to surrender my dream of going to L&L (damn, missed the Thriller number, bet that rocked &lt;g&gt;).  My new dream, top of my list, is to make it to Life Is Good.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-71458062">I have a pretty good list, and I am happy to put some of it on the  <br/>
back burner until kids are older and don&#39;t need me so much. However,  <br/>
my confession is that one of my things that I have 	ALWAYS 	wanted to  <br/>
do, for 25 years now, is to drive a cement mixer. No one believes me,  <br/>
but it&#39;s written down on my list of things that will happen. I didn&#39;t  <br/>
know HOW to make it happen, I chat up construction guys when we run  <br/>
across them (hey, having inquisitive kids kept me from being too shy)  <br/>
and it used to be you just worked your way into it. Now you have to  <br/>
take classes and training sessions and stuff.<br/>
<br/>
But when we were at the state fair a few weeks ago, guess what I saw?  <br/>
A booth for a school not more than a few miles from my house. And  <br/>
what do they teach? How to work large vehicles. All kinds, not just  <br/>
cement mixers. I&#39;m prego right now, but dh snagged me the information  <br/>
and free video. Omg....I might go to schol. Or I might just keep  <br/>
chatting up construction guys and see if they&#39;ll let me drive one  <br/>
some day. without all that stuff. Or I might even just skip to other  <br/>
stuff on the list and let the knowledge of possibility give me a  <br/>
little tickle whenever I think about it. It&#39;s kind of fun to even  <br/>
just KNOW that your list can come true instead of thinking how  <br/>
impossible.<br/>

Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Confessions of a &#39;do it nower&#39;, was Not being boring ... How?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have a pretty good list, and I am happy to put some of it on the <br/>
back burner until kids are older and don&#39;t need me so much. However, <br/>
my confession is that one of my things that I have ALWAYS wanted to <br/>
do, for 25 years now, is to drive a cement mixer. No one believes me, <br/>
but it&#39;s written down on my list of things that will happen. I didn&#39;t <br/>
know HOW to make it happen, I chat up construction guys when we run <br/>
across them (hey, having inquisitive kids kept me from being too shy) <br/>
and it used to be you just worked your way into it. Now you have to <br/>
take classes and training sessions and stuff.<br/>
<br/>
But when we were at the state fair a few weeks ago, guess what I saw? <br/>
A booth for a school not more than a few miles from my house. And <br/>
what do they teach? How to work large vehicles. All kinds, not just <br/>
cement mixers. I&#39;m prego right now, but dh snagged me the information <br/>
and free video. Omg....I might go to schol. Or I might just keep <br/>
chatting up construction guys and see if they&#39;ll let me drive one <br/>
some day. without all that stuff. Or I might even just skip to other <br/>
stuff on the list and let the knowledge of possibility give me a <br/>
little tickle whenever I think about it. It&#39;s kind of fun to even <br/>
just KNOW that your list can come true instead of thinking how <br/>
impossible.<br/>

 <br/>
We had that on our list last year.  And we did make it.  And it  was very <br/>
cool.  Cool...and also &quot;cool&quot; for this family from  Florida..&lt;g&gt;   And the bonus <br/>
of that trip was that our flight  home had some sort of airline responsible <br/>
problem and they gave us 4 round trip  tickets to anywhere AirTran flies to be <br/>
used within one year.<br/>
 <br/>
So....the possibilities expanded far beyond our initial vision to make it  to <br/>
Life is Good.   The vision board has just brought so much focus  into our <br/>
lives about what is important to us individually and as a family. <br/>
