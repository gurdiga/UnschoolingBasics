<div id="ygrps-yiv-976277743">My 12 yo discovered a Scott &quot;The Piano Guy&quot; Houston<br/>
special on PBS today, and is still sitting in front on<br/>
the piano in her pajamas :)  It&#39;s such a cool<br/>
unschool-y way to learn piano, that I just wanted to<br/>
pass it along in case you&#39;ve missed it ;) <br/>
www.scotthouston.com  There is a list of PBS stations<br/>
that he will be on, although he was on ours today and<br/>
it didn&#39;t list it....Anyway, she&#39;s picked out two<br/>
Christmas carols already, both hands, with no prior<br/>
experience!<br/>
