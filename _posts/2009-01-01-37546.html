<div id="ygrps-yiv-613581973">Though I am pretty sure we are not ready to claim Radical Unschooling<br/>
I think we are finally to the point I am comfortable saying we<br/>
unschool. We do have some workbooks that dd6 does but she likes them<br/>
except the coloring part as she has never been into coloring so we<br/>
skip that or do it different like circling what is suppose to be<br/>
colored or making a mark through it and its her choice to do them or<br/>
not. I will sometimes suggest them when she is bored but thats because<br/>
she seems to like them better then most the other &quot;usual&quot; suggestions<br/>
like coloring or painting and such.<br/>
<br/>
Dd13 has discovered teen second life. She has gotten so good at making<br/>
stuff. I tried second life a couple years ago and was so frustrated by<br/>
the building and such that I had to give it up as it was NOT FUN. She<br/>
has had all sorts of different in world jobs and I am so impressed<br/>
with all the cool things she has been making. She has been making<br/>
vendors for a shop she works for so she can sell the stuff she is<br/>
making and everything. Its so cool and since I just did not get it<br/>
there is no way for me to ruin it by trying to teach her or show her.<br/>
I do have to be careful and rein in the marketing degree and my father<br/>
the marketing profs little voice who wants to lecture about all sorts<br/>
of market strategy and other such stuff that will suck the joy right<br/>
out of it.<br/>
<br/>
DD13 and I got the twilight series for the holidays. She has already<br/>
consumed 2 of the books and I am not sure how far through 3 she is.<br/>
<br/>
DD6 is discovering the world of mabinogi which is a bit of a<br/>
frustration as there is a ton of reading involved and she does not<br/>
like to read that sort of thing yet. Too many words and takes too long<br/>
and is too frustrating. It would be less of a problem if I didn&#39;t have<br/>
an almost constant sour throat this winter. I think she mostly wants<br/>
to play because mom does and for a while DD13 did too.<br/>
<br/>
The other day she made a set of stairs with the encyclopedias and<br/>
after walking up and down that a few times she actually started look<br/>
IN them and then would have me read to her what some things were!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-11106415">I think the point at which you can look at your kids and enjoy all the  <br/>
cool things you see them doing (instead of seeing all the things you  <br/>
think they should be doing) is an important milestone in the path of  <br/>
unschooling.  I enjoyed hearing about all the fun things they are up to.<br/>
<br/>
Make sure you don&#39;t miss out on your part, that is, figure out what&#39;s  <br/>
fun and enjoyable to them about what they are doing and join them or  <br/>
offer things that you know they would enjoy based on what you&#39;ve  <br/>
observed.  Just to take an example, The dd building a staircase with  <br/>
the encyclopedias might enjoy some BIG building blocks, or a set of  <br/>
dominoes to set up and knock down?   It would be a mistake to look at  <br/>
that and think the part where she was reading the books was more  <br/>
valuable than the part where she was stacking them.<br/>
<br/>
If dd13 is half way through book 3 of the twilight series she might  <br/>
enjoy making Bella&#39;s bracelet from items at the craft store or online  <br/>
- Maybe she would enjoy carving her own Jacob&#39;s wolf,  or &lt;gasp&gt;  <br/>
learning to ride a motorcycle?  Actually, we have had a number of  <br/>
really enjoyable conversations while reading the Twilight books.   <br/>
While I  got all swept away by the romance the self possessed  <br/>
homeschoolers I know said they would never put up with Edward&#39;s  <br/>
controlling behavior!  I was so thrilled to hear their thoughts on the  <br/>
matter - so different from what I hear from the schooled teens of my  <br/>
acquaintance.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s one of those weird things that happens when you let children use things in a way they weren&#39;t intended.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Had you insisted that she *read* the books, she may never have opened them with interest. But being able to explore them how *she* saw fit enabled her to come to them in her own time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Can you imagine how many parents/teachers would have insisted that she NOT walk on books?! As we all know: books are for reading, *not* enjoying! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-741724510">lol It reminded me of when I was a kid and would make race tracks for my brothers cars using the encyclopedias. and would sit and read about the flags and things in them. I had 2 brothers so we mostly had boy toys. I also liked to read textbooks and sometimes bought them from used book sales but then dad was a professor. <br/>
