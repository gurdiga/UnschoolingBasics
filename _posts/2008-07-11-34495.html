 </span></blockquote>When my daughter was 2, she would become overwhelmed with too many choices.<br/>
I learned not to bother her with it too much, reading her queues to know<br/>
when she would be open to more choices.  For instance, if she were quietly<br/>
playing and I knew she&#39;d be hungry soon.  Instead of going to her and asking<br/>
her what she&#39;d like to eat and then giving her all kinds of options of what<br/>
we have in the kitchen, I&#39;d just make a plate of a few little snacks that I<br/>
knew she liked, and bring it to her.<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t always discuss every option that was available to her because at<br/>
that age it was just too much input for her and she would become very<br/>
overwhelmed and unhappy.<br/>
