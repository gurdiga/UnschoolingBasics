 <br/>
There is a spectacular line-up of thought provoking sessions on tap,  <br/>
designed to encourage you to stretch your ideas and beliefs about  unschooling.  So <br/>
join other unschooling families as we delve deeply  into the principles of <br/>
unschooling and together we learn, challenge,  discuss, absorb, chat and rethink <br/>
philosophies of unschooling and parenting over  these four days.<br/>
 <br/>
Included among the many sessions available:<br/>
 <br/>
Dealing with Reluctance <br/>
An open discussion with  reluctant dads or other family members who may have <br/>
questions about unschooling  versus classroom learning. He invites unschooled <br/>
teens and their families to  join him in discussing the issues raised, and the <br/>
opportunities and  possibilities a free education can provide. With Drew <br/>
Dorsey.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling in a Rotten Economy<br/>
You&#39;re a family who may  only have one working adult and maybe the trust fund <br/>
has suffered with the Wall  Street Adventures. Your teenager wants to trek <br/>
through Europe, your preteen  wants a dirt bike, and your eight year old wants <br/>
lots of Webkinz. What do you  do? How do you help everyone fulfill their dreams <br/>
and still have something other  than Ramen noodles for supper? Hosted by Beth <br/>
Toolan<br/>
 <br/>
Even More Different <br/>
Face it, as unschoolers we live  out of the mainstream. But what if your <br/>
family includes even more differences -  Disabilities, being gay, being of color, <br/>
or anything else? How do you get  support within the unschooling community <br/>
with your difference, or in your other  communities as unschoolers? Hosted by <br/>
Kathryn Baptista, including Erika  Davis-Pitre.<br/>
 <br/>
How Will He Ever Learn to Read if You Don&#39;t TEACH Him?  <br/>
You&#39;ve heard it from friends, in-laws, strangers, even spouses: How will he  <br/>
ever learn to read if you don&#39;t TEACH him? But I&#39;m here to tell you it&#39;s  <br/>
possible. And the results are dramatic! <br/>
Reading is learned naturally---and  easily---in a world rich with text. We&#39;ll <br/>
discuss ages and stages of reading,  gateways to comprehension, books that <br/>
inspire, and hints to help you deal with  concerned &quot;others.&quot; With Kelly Lovejoy.<br/>
<br/>
Why Put the &quot;Radical&quot; in  Radical Unschooling?<br/>
What IS &quot;radical unschooling&quot; and why is it  important? Why can&#39;t unschooling <br/>
be just about academics? It can, but then you&#39;d  be missing out on the BEST <br/>
parts of your child&#39;s learning! We&#39;ll talk about  bedtimes and food and chores <br/>
and hygiene and other radical ideas.<br/>
