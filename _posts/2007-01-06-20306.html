<div id="ygrps-yiv-1750330386">I&#39;ve been lurking around, reading the various postings that have <br/>
come up lately, and I guess I want to add my two cents on the topic <br/>
of rules/limits/yes/no/maybe.....<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps there&#39;s no absolute-- each child has their own needs and <br/>
issues, as does each parent.  As my husband said last night when we <br/>
were discussing this, it&#39;s all relative.  In one situation, no <br/>
limits is an expression of total trust and love, and the <br/>
child &quot;gets&quot; that (even if they wish their parents had said &quot;no&quot; <br/>
more often, as we heard from an unschooled person).  In another <br/>
situation, no limits is perceived as neglect and the child feels <br/>
unloved and insignificant, wishing their parents cared enough to say <br/>
no occasionally.  And few of us are in a utopic situation; demands <br/>
like work, chores, perhaps aging parents, illnesses, or <br/>
other challenges present themselves and we need to adjust to meet <br/>
these challenges.<br/>
<br/>
For one child playing WOW all day may be an expression of passion <br/>
and determination, for another it may be a fearful escape from <br/>
having to deal with the real world, which may be a painful or scary <br/>
place for them to be... <br/>
<br/>
Life is a work in progress, and anyone who thinks that they have the <br/>
one and only answer, and because it works for them it will work for <br/>
everyone, is taking a narrow and unrealistic view in my opinion... I <br/>
think we each have to follow our gut, be sensitive to and respectful <br/>
of those around us...easier said than done...!<br/>
<br/>
For instance, school definitely works for our 11th grade daughter---<br/>
nobody needs <br/>
to feel sorry for her because she does not have the freedom of an <br/>
unschooled life. On the other hand, school was a living hell for our <br/>
14 yo son and when he crashed last spring, he left and never went <br/>
back. This turned our world, our expectations, our assumptions, our <br/>
thinking, upside down.<br/>
<br/>
So from where I&#39;m sitting, the only absolute is our love for our <br/>
families, the rest is an open question... and we each have to try to <br/>
determine for ourselves what is best, given the circumstances that <br/>
present themselves.  We make mistakes, we try a different approach, <br/>
we stay open, we communicate... definitely more shades of gray than <br/>
black and white.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1948657934">I appreciate the individual respect unschooling has at the heart of it&#39;s philosphy.  This reply seems to take that into account.  We nuture and allow our families the freedom to chose; to be whatever they need in whatever enviroment is best.  We are the only ones who can recognize the needs and work toward the healthiest life possible for our families. <br/>
Thanks for the contribution. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-578295762"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Perhaps there&#39;s no absolute-- each child has their own needs and <br/>
&gt; issues, as does each parent.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I really liked your post here. I have found in my own life which has <br/>
included extensive contact with families of many persuasions and <br/>
children of endless variation, that parenting is best accomplished <br/>
when it is responsive to the individual child, and not reactive. And <br/>
when it is responsive to a set of rules, societal norms or idealistic <br/>
models and philosophies more so than to the child himself, I think <br/>
that&#39;s a big problem.<br/>
<br/>
How many of us thought judgemental things about families who had a <br/>
child that did X or behaved like Y, only to later on have our own <br/>
child who did the same things? If only those people were more <br/>
controlling. If only they were less controlling. It really never <br/>
ends. I remember a woman in my midwifery apprenticeship long ago <br/>
whose baby just didn&#39;t seem right to her, and everyone blamed her and <br/>
her husband, after first denying anything was wrong. People asserted <br/>
he was off because she had projected it onto him. Because their <br/>
marriage ended (it ended more from the stress of the parenting <br/>
actually)Turns out, he is autistic, and now several more families <br/>
have had children with various neurological issues and that community <br/>
has had to really look at their perceptions and judgments. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have absolutely factual information about much of what I need <br/>
to make decisions on in my life, including parenting. Accepting this <br/>
has been a relief in a lot of ways. I accept that I will handle <br/>
things poorly sometimes, and that I will make the best decision I can <br/>
and it will still turn out poorly sometimes. I remember when I was <br/>
earlier on in my midwifery career and realized that the death of a <br/>
baby was an inevitability. No matter how hard I tried and how good a <br/>
midwife I was, if I did a lot of births in all likelihood a baby I <br/>
was involved with would die. The anticipation of this was papralyzing <br/>
sometimes. I just didn&#39;t want it to ever ever happen. I wanted to do <br/>
everything right, never make a mistake, and knowing I was human and <br/>
could screw up was so frustrating. Knowing I could not screw up and a <br/>
baby could still die was also frustrating. And then it happened. It <br/>
was horrible, it was no ones fault, it was life. It just was.  I <br/>
recognized somewhere in there that all I could do was really think <br/>
about my choices, and make the decisions that my intuition and head- <br/>
heart combo guided me to make. This has become true of my life <br/>
outside my job. And it really applies to parenting for me.<br/>
<br/>
I use the word &quot;no&quot; very rarely. I always look for a way to frame my <br/>
response positively. I find this more honest actually. Because the <br/>
true answer isn&#39;t usually &quot;no&quot;, its &quot;yes, but later on&quot;, &quot;Yes, if we <br/>
do it like this&quot;, &quot;yes, if I help you with this part&quot; and &quot;yes <br/>
whatever.&quot; The knee jerk preface &quot;NO&quot; before the further explination <br/>
to the child is so ubiquitous, and so unexamined. I hear it all the <br/>
time. It takes some retraining to stop no-ing kids when the answer is <br/>
actually more complex than &quot;NO&quot;. It also makes the &quot;NO&quot; way more <br/>
effective when you need a child to stop moving toward a rattlesnack.<br/>
<br/>
I worked in a health clinic for years as a counselor. I ran a lot of <br/>
HIV tests, pregnancy tests, did STD screening and counseling and much <br/>
of it for teenagers. Their parents weren&#39;t there, because their <br/>
parents had made the message clear: If you screw up, I won&#39;t love <br/>
you. And the kids heard that message loud and clear and believed it. <br/>
The ways in which parents use terror, fear, conditional love and <br/>
threats to try and control their childrens sexuality are shocking to <br/>
me. Do you really want to be the last person to know about your <br/>
childs pregnancy? Do you really want your child managing a serious <br/>
health problem or STD all alone with adult strangers to help them? <br/>
Because if you use these tactics, that&#39;s what some of you will get.<br/>
<br/>
It strikes me, that most of the unschooled teens I know are pretty <br/>
geeky sexually. Meaning, they aren&#39;t actually doing it. I know a lot <br/>
of teen and adult unschooled kids, and the vast majority (I mean, <br/>
99%) never had sex til they were adults. I can&#39;t say that of ANY of <br/>
the kids I went to school with. I think its because their parental <br/>
relationships are fulfilling enough that they don&#39;t have to look <br/>
elsewhere to try and meet those emotional needs or validate their <br/>
self worth. Adults have this bizarre mythology sometimes that if they <br/>
just tell their kids not to have sex, or threaten them with death and <br/>
homelessness then they just won&#39;t do these things. Yet statistics <br/>
keep telling us it isn&#39;t true. They do these things MORE often, they <br/>
do them LESS safely, and they do it while hiding it as best they can <br/>
from their parents.<br/>
The other approach you can have is unconditional love for your child. <br/>
Sending the message consistently, thoroughly and with respect to <br/>
everything, that your child is your heart, and nothing ever will <br/>
change that. That they can do anything and tell you about it and you <br/>
will love them and help them as best you can. That they will not be <br/>
punished, or rejected, ever by you. You can&#39;t protect them from the <br/>
truly natural consequences of the world, or from the consequences <br/>
societally imposed, but it won&#39;t affect your love of them and their <br/>
place in their family.<br/>
I feel like it isn&#39;t enough just to say this stuff in a big lecture <br/>
format, it takes consistent behavior that really says this to them <br/>
with action from birth onward. <br/>
