<br/>
I have a 5 y.o. with some pretty intense challenges that can&#39;t STAND<br/>
people younger than him. He will tell me &quot;I HATE babies&quot; and he means<br/>
it. They don&#39;t understand his personal boundaries (which are many) and<br/>
he has a very difficult time with impulse control and other people&#39;s<br/>

better.<br/>

Everything Leslie said about this, had me nodding my head in<br/>
agreement. We do better if we meet on neutral territory like a park,<br/>
swimming hole or museum. I don&#39;t invite people with babies or wee<br/>
toddlers over anymore, it just isn&#39;t worth the stress. They will grow<br/>
and gain new tools, this won&#39;t last forever (just feels like it when<br/>
you&#39;re in the middle of it).<br/>
<br/>
So nothing new to share here, just some sympathy and wanting to let<br/>
you know you&#39;re not alone. Some kids just need a LOT of space around<br/>
their lives, and a lot of time to figure out the intricacies of social<br/>
interactions.:)<br/>

I just want to encourage with this; I too have a son (now 16) who <br/>
had/has very strong boundary issues and meeting with other children <br/>
at his request was alway challenging to say the least.  But today he <br/>
is a very social teenager with a wide variety of friends.  He still <br/>
has very strong boundaries, that is who he is, but he has the <br/>
ability and control to handle any situation he has encountered. With <br/>
the help of two great understand moms who were raising their <br/>
children with the same philsophy we muddled through with tears and <br/>
laughter sometimes both at the same time. <br/>
I am amazed at the beautiful complexity of our relationships with <br/>
our children.  How can we enjoy the time we have now so much and <br/>
with reflection it grows even sweeter? Life is sweet!<br/>
Good Day!<br/>
Donna <br/>

I think now that he has stated that he doesn&#39;t want to get together I can honor his wishes.  <br/>
Before he stated this he always did want to get together, it was me that was iffy because I <br/>
knew that it was always challenging, but I also wanted to honor his wishes of getting <br/>
together with friends and then try my hardest to be there when he needed me.  Maybe now <br/>
that he is getting better able to articulate his feelings like your 5 year old we can come to <br/>
an understanding.  I see so many parents that push their children into social situations <br/>
and then demand that they &quot;play nice&quot; or &quot;get along&quot;, and then I&#39;ve had people (mostly <br/>
family) tell me that he doesn&#39;t know how to play with other kids because he&#39;s always just <br/>
around me & dh (which isn&#39;t true at all).  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for commiserating with me:)<br/>

It&#39;s nice to hear from you & Leslie that your sons were similar and you all got through it <br/>
fine, thanks for validating my feelings.<br/>
<br/>
I think even at this age my son has very strong boundaries, my husband and I have <br/>
definately failed the test a time or two and he is teaching us soooo much more sometimes <br/>
then I think we are teaching him.  I think that having strong boundaries is definately a <br/>
good thing because you won&#39;t worry about them being taken advantage of.  It&#39;s nice to <br/>
hear when families respect their children and understand them instead of trying the <br/>
change them or force them to be someone they aren&#39;t.<br/>

that there was an alternative to these get-togethers.  To him when I<br/>
would say &quot;Do you want to go play with Fred (made up name)?&quot; in his<br/>
mind it said, &quot;Do you want to go play with Fred or do nothing?&quot;  When<br/>
I started showing him the alternatives such as &quot;Do you want to go play<br/>
with  Fred or would you rather stay home and bake cookies today?&quot; he<br/>
started realizing that Fred wasn&#39;t the only option.  He might decide<br/>
that he does want to play with Fred or he might decide that he wants<br/>
to stay home and bake cookies.  As he got used to the idea that there<br/>
was more than &quot;just Fred&quot; he would offer his own alternatives if he<br/>
didn&#39;t really want to go play with Fred.  He might say, &quot;I don&#39;t want<br/>
to play with  Fred.  Could we go to the big open park and fly a kite<br/>
instead?&quot;<br/>
