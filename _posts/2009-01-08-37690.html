<div id="ygrps-yiv-1870945315">Yesterday I sent this to be  added to Cameron Lovejoy&#39;s book:<br/>
<br/>
Generosity is not giving me that which I need more than you do, but it <br/>
is giving me that which you need more than I do. <br/>

This morning I am in the computer drinking my coffe while Brian is <br/>
playing with the kids when they come to deliver a box. They took the box<br/>
sent to Naruto and Gigi and I went back to the computer and I can hear <br/>
the laughter and excitment in the next room.<br/>
I came out and there it is the kids filling up with candy the Disney <br/>
Princesses Pez collection that they really wanted the other day.<br/>
I was stunned. Who sent it ???<br/>
How did the person know that it what my kids wanted?<br/>
To you our fairly godmother or godfather:<br/>
Thank you from the bottom of my heart. My kids truely loved it and <br/>
can&#39;t stop running around.<br/>
I am touched by your kindness and generosity.<br/>
I will blog later with pictures of the pez and the kids. The candy will <br/>
be half way gone by then I believe.<br/>
What a beautiful day. I feel so blessed to know people that care so <br/>
much.<br/>
Thank you is not enough.<br/>
You have made my kids very happy and I love you for that.<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Alex</div>
