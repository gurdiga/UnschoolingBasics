<div id="ygrps-yiv-1773198119">This thought started when I was writing about the Star Wars marathon but it<br/>
seemed to go in a different direction so I thought I would retitle it.<br/>
I took my kids to a program put on by the state conservation department. It<br/>
was about woodpeckers. ( Read a story, learn about woodpeckers, make a<br/>
feeder for them, kind of nice.)  My older two were too old to participate in<br/>
the program because it was geared for preschoolers.  So before we left the<br/>
house I asked them to bring something to work on.<br/>
They will usually grab a book or a drawing journal or similar things.  This<br/>
time my oldest took a Star Wars character book.  It is a pretty thick book<br/>
with &quot;many details&quot; about characters in all of the stories, including those<br/>
who aren&#39;t even in the movies.<br/>
My boys put  serious thought into following all of the connections in<br/>
there.  They talk on and on about characters, political connections, and all<br/>
sorts of things. I can&#39;t keep up with it myself.<br/>
So at the end of program  the &quot;teacher&quot; asked my makeup artists, comic book<br/>
artists, authors, etc that think learning about woodpeckers would be a nice<br/>
hobby but not really a &quot;study&quot;.<br/>
Much Joy,<br/>
