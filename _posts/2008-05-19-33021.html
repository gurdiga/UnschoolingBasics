<div id="ygrps-yiv-580668217">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
We are new unschoolers, starting our migration in Oct &#39;07. I have <br/>
read a lot on this list, on sites (Joyfully Rejoicing and Dandra <br/>
Dodd), and in books (John Holt, Grace Llewellyn, etc). I want <br/>
unschooling to be our lifestyle. DH has lingering reservations for <br/>
which I need help to address.<br/>
<br/>
Recently, DH wondered if our boys (7 & 6) might become less &quot;well-<br/>
rounded&quot; adults as a result of unschooling. DH openly admitted to <br/>
hating school. He attended a variety of public and private schools, <br/>
even after his Dad stopped moving with the military. DH believes that <br/>
this (hated) schooling made him well-rounded and helped him know a <br/>
little about a lot. He finds this broad knowledge useful when he <br/>
communicates with strangers. DH is an airline pilot who flies 3-5 day <br/>
trips, usually with someone different each trip. He takes pride in <br/>
his ability to make conversation with people having widely varied <br/>
interests. I think that DH wants the boys to have this same <br/>
capability.<br/>
<br/>
When I asked if DH was willing to read about unschooling, he declined <br/>
to read a book (though he is an avid reader and researcher for his <br/>
own interests). So, I will print posts for him. <br/>
<br/>
Please help me address DH&#39;s concern: if we unschool, the boys will <br/>
not become well-rounded adults. <br/>
<br/>
BTW, we are attending the NE Unschooling Conference this weekend and <br/>
I am very excited! I already asked DH to attend the first SSUD&#39;S <br/>
gathering on Friday afternoon. I also hope seeing (meeting?) older <br/>
unschooled kids will ease his discomfort. I will print any responses <br/>
we get before our departure on Weds so we can read them enroute.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1398074992">I think being well-rounded has some very nice aspects to it, but I don&#39;t know that it is the be-all end-all. I don&#39;t know very much about Asian history, or Euclidian geometry, or South African literature. I live in Europe and I can&#39;t name all the countries in the EU (although in my defense I will say they keep changing all the time). I&#39;m not the best person to begin a discussion on String theory, &#39;cause I just get really confused. That said, I can talk for a long, long time on evolution and biology. How deep is rounded? Do we need folk like Stephen Hawking to be able to discourse passionately about the different literary devices in Gravity&#39;s Rainbow? <br/>
<br/>
That said, I think that Unschooling can lead to a very broad understanding of the world. By exposure to many things, ideas, conversations, museums, movies, television, books, magazines, pertaining to a specific interest, you can end up anywhere. Sandra Dodd has a game called &quot;thinking sticks&quot;.(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/thinkingsticks)">http://sandradodd.com/thinkingsticks)</a>They are popsicles with words written on them. Each one, I believe, has a single word, written on it. And the game is to connect two sticks, two words together. So you choose and you get shoes and dog. You could think about shoes that have been chewed by your dog, you could go with Elvis and Blue Suade Shoes and You Ain&#39;t Nothing But a Hound Dog, or Hushpuppy shoes. Whatever connections you make, and I&#39;m sure there are a lot more connections to make than I can think of at the minute, they are conversations about how any idea, any focus can send you off understanding more about the world than before you had that focus or question<br/>
 or idea. It is also about how ideas and things are all connected. Having not read Gravity&#39;s Rainbow, but noting quickly that it is, at least somewhat, about the V-2 rocket, it is possible that it is among the things that Stephen Hawking could talk about. <br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, must go, have children to rouse and a plane to catch.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1489775738">Hi Lisa-<br/>
<br/>
I personally take exception to the term well-rounded. I attended a <br/>
private high school at which this term has the bench mark for success. I <br/>
was not well-rounded(no sports- all art activities)- and was told often <br/>
that I should be. I suppose the goal of this was to look good on an Ivy <br/>
league application- as far as I could figure.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooled children sometimes do many different things- sometimes will <br/>
focus more on what seems to be one thing. To me, it is much more <br/>
valuable to make your own choice about how you are in the world than to <br/>
have any idea about well-roundedness in your mind. My son spends a good <br/>
portion of his time on music- practice, listening, rehearsals, <br/>
performing. He also plays Starcraft and Halo, Magic, soccer, and <br/>
basketball. That seems pretty darned well-rounded to me! My daughter <br/>
primarily watches a ton of movies and tv shows, she also draws, writes, <br/>
sews, does many crafts, plays basketball, and takes swimming lessons, <br/>
and plays with her cat. That also seems well-rounded. None of it would <br/>
seem well-rounded to Mr. Gratwick(my HS guidance counselor).<br/>
<br/>
Not sure if this is helpful to your situation- just my thoughts. There <br/>
is no guarantee that an unschooled child will learn what kids in school <br/>
learn, or that they will learn a little bit of everything. Maybe it <br/>
would be easier to convince him that well-roundedness is an outdated <br/>
concept- and that the way of the future is specialization. I always <br/>
thought that being deeply immersed in something you love was of much <br/>
more value than learning a tiny bit about a lot of different stuff that <br/>
you forgot a month later.<br/>
<br/>
As far as communicating with strangers- I think that listening to NPR <br/>
and This American Life really is the key for me- gives me plenty of <br/>
interesting things to talk about. TV watching or newspaper reading I am <br/>
sure would accomplish the same thing. In addition I think that an <br/>
unschooled person would have such an unusual body of knowledge compared <br/>
to a schooled person that that would certainly allow them to connect in <br/>
a much deeper way and possible over a broader spectrum anyway. My son <br/>
has connected to so many people through his current specialty, music. It <br/>
really is a joy to observe.<br/>

(Or is it not the case anymore that you pay only a small percentage of<br/>
your airline ticket if your spouse works for an airline?)  If so, that<br/>
is a tool that, combined with unschooling, can make your kids very<br/>
well-rounded (or at least very well-traveled, and that helps...)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1170188139">I think something that perhaps unschooled kids would have is not so much<br/>
little categorized bits of data but rather a continuing curiosity about<br/>
the world and everything in it. <br/>
<br/>
Heck, we spent a good 10 or 15 minutes chatting with the young lady<br/>
making the pretzel bites at the movie theater last night while waiting<br/>
for the theater to be cleaned so we could go in and see Prince Caspian.<br/>
They make the things fresh right there so she was off to one side of the<br/>
concession area rolling out and cutting dough, taking the cooked<br/>
pretzels/bits out of the oven and brushing them with melted butter and<br/>
sprinkling on the cinnamon sugar. We chatted about pretzels and movies<br/>
and how she&#39;s gotten so good at what she does that she doesn&#39;t even need<br/>
the timer to know when things are ready. We had fun and she got a bit of<br/>
a lift in an otherwise relatively thankless task (she grinned when I<br/>
mentioned that I bet she didn&#39;t expect to be the focus of as much<br/>
interest as a feature film lol). That had -nothing- to do with what is<br/>
typically called &#39;well rounded&#39;.  Being interested in other people and<br/>
what they do and the stuff that&#39;s around us is, IMO, a valuable &#39;tool&#39;<br/>
in life, perhaps more than all those data nuggets kids get fed in<br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
And, FWIW, yup, we&#39;ve got all sorts of resources at our house - from<br/>
Pokemon magazine to Time to Popular Science to National Geographic to a<br/>
whole assortment of cable channels and DVDs to the Internet and all the<br/>
odd news bits therein (ever seen the YouTube video of the Vegetable<br/>
orchestra?)- curiosity is everywhere! LOL One of our favorite things is<br/>
connecting actors in one movie or program to something else to something<br/>
else. We&#39;ve made some of the bizarre-est connections (one time we<br/>
connected JFK to John Belushi - it&#39;s actually not too hard once you know<br/>
that The Governator, Arnold Schwarzenegger, is married to Maria Shriver<br/>
who is Kennedy kin). And not only people but ideas, places, events too.<br/>
For instance, there is actually a real life person who is working on<br/>
developing Star Trek transporter technology. One of the problems is the<br/>
Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (you can&#39;t know where an atom is AND<br/>
what it is doing at the same time, only one or the other). Well, on Star<br/>
Trek (TNG), they mention in one episode that they use a Heisenberg<br/>
compensator. TV and quantum physics! Whoo hoo!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Lisa<br/>
I&#39;ll be at the NE Unschooling conference too.  Can&#39;t wait to see you <br/>
there!  The thing I find interesting is the idea that our kids can <br/>
only get the positive aspects we got out of school by going through <br/>
the unpleasantness we experienced.  In your husbands case he was <br/>
forced to be outgoing, friendly and easy to get along with because <br/>
of his experience.  He has in turn made good use of that skill he <br/>
learned as an adult.  His ability to cope with a difficult situation <br/>
in a postive manner is a really good skill.  Part of it is probably <br/>
his personality and family support in addition to the practice he <br/>
got as a kid.  His children may or may not have the same natural <br/>
disposition to be easygoing.  Another child in his position may have <br/>
become withdrawn, depressed and socially awkward.  I think <br/>
unschooling is ideal for giving your kids the opportunity to play to <br/>
their strengths as well as overcome their barriers in a much more <br/>
natural way.   <br/>
<br/>
My daughter is 15 and has been unschooling since February 07.  When <br/>
she was in school she was terrified all the time.  She wore baggy <br/>
clothes and kept her hood up a lot.  Her grades were ok but she was <br/>
sick a lot.  She had headaches, stomache aches, hives and mono.  She <br/>
couldn&#39;t spend the night away from me so missed a lot of things she <br/>
wanted to do.  In the last year she has gone to camp for a week, <br/>
been in a play, visited friends in New hampshire for 2 weeks, taken <br/>
a cake decorating class, learned to take the bus on her own, worked <br/>
as a babysitter up to 10 hours a week, payed for and taken a weaving <br/>
class, gone to New Orleans for a week to help with Katrina recovery <br/>
and a hundred other things every day.  A year ago I was worried my <br/>
daughter might hurt herself now she is a bright and happy young <br/>
woman.  I know her hardships have made her stronger but I wish she <br/>
didn&#39;t have to go through them.  The world is hard enough we don&#39;t <br/>
have to create artificial hardships for our children.<br/>
<br/>
See you this weekend!<br/>

Maintaining a sense of curiosity and wonder about the world - that  <br/>
eagerness to learn that all young children seem to have before it is  <br/>
schooled out of them - that is what makes for an interesting and  <br/>
interested person and it is probably THE number one reason we unschool.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for the perspective. It reinforced one of my reflections that <br/>
was similar to your thought of &quot;how deep is rounded.&quot; I tried to <br/>
think of how we would know when someone achieved the condition of <br/>
being &quot;well-rounded&quot; and concluded that it is unknowable. <br/>
<br/>
One of my favorite conceptions of unschooling is the idea that all <br/>
knowledge is linked and not artificially grouped by academic topic. <br/>
Which may lead to a different type of well-roundedness than what <br/>
might be obtained from a &quot;liberal arts&quot; education.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-743398189">Deb, <br/>
<br/>
You talked about &quot;curiosity about the world and everything in it.&quot; <br/>
One of my favorite activities these days is to watch the boys play <br/>
outside. They are keenly interested in studying bugs right now - and <br/>
are learning about mean plants (thorns, prickly pear, thistle) from <br/>
our wild yard. These experiences are so much richer than coloring a <br/>
picture of a bug or a thorny plant in school.<br/>
<br/>
One of my organizing goals as we settle in this house is to make more <br/>
resources accessible to the boys, especially books, magazines, and <br/>
the internet. We do subscribe to National Geographic and we enjoyed <br/>
the China edition a lot as Mulan is currently a favored <br/>
movie/playtime event in our house. I&#39;m curious if you have other <br/>
magazine recommendations for young children (6 & 7). <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your insights and personal examples. The boys are starting <br/>
to interact with adults we encounter outside the home. I think this <br/>
will also be a plus for them from unschooling - and may help them <br/>
become better conversationalists!<br/>

Thanks for sharing your story about your daughter. I&#39;m so glad that she <br/>
is thriving now!<br/>
<br/>
I have to confess that I loved elementary school - a lot. And then I <br/>
hated school every year after it, more and more, until I got expelled <br/>
in my senior year for &quot;excessive absences - many of which were <br/>
unexcused.&quot; (I think I was one of John Holt&#39;s data points!) But the <br/>
real irony is that I went back to school, even at the graduate level, <br/>
and did well. The difference is that going back was MY choice. And I <br/>
had some control over what I studied. And I could leave.<br/>
<br/>
But, getting back to the topic, I don&#39;t remember any positive aspects <br/>
to school when I was required to attend. I definitely don&#39;t think that <br/>
the experience made me well-rounded - just bored and a bit angry. Then <br/>
we had a yukky Kindergarten experience with Daniel, our 7 year old. I <br/>
just could not imagine 12 more years of that struggle and frustration. <br/>
And I am soooooo happy to have stumbled across unschooling. Now I want <br/>
DH, Jim, to embrace this too. <br/>
<br/>
So, thanks for your example. Your daughter sounds like she is <br/>
definitely becoming well-rounded (and well traveled too)! I look <br/>
forward to meeting you this weekend.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1608925023">Pam, I agree whole-heartedly.  This is the first thing I thought of when I<br/>
read the original post.  The most interesting conversationalist is not the<br/>
one who shows how much he knows, but the one who provokes and draws out his<br/>
partner in conversation.  Ask questions, then shut up and listen to the<br/>
answers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;A gossip is one who talks to you about others; a bore is one who talks to<br/>
&gt; you about himself; and a brilliant conversationalist is one who talks to you<br/>
&gt; about yourself.&quot;  (Lisa Kirk)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It would be fascinating to know how many Jeopardy contestants consider<br/>
themselves &quot;well-rounded&quot;.  Whenever I start to experience doubts about<br/>
whether my children will be able to get along in the world, my husband<br/>
cracks, &quot;Yep, you&#39;re right.  We ought to put them in school.  That way they<br/>
can make a living spouting trivia on game shows.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As for becoming a &quot;well-rounded&quot; person, two of my favorite books are *An<br/>
Incomplete Education*, by Judy Jones and William Wilson and *Cultural<br/>
Literacy*, by E.D. Hirsch (of *What Your X Grader Needs to Know* fame).<br/>
They&#39;re easy to read and fun.  I have a B.S., an M.A. and a J.D., and there<br/>
were things in these books that I just didn&#39;t know because I had never been<br/>
exposed to them or had forgotten.  There&#39;s a reason these books exist --<br/>
schools, including colleges, don&#39;t produce well-rounded people.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, there is so much information out there and jobs are changing so<br/>
rapidly, how can anyone know what skills or information our children will<br/>
need to find satisfaction and success?  I spent a year in high school<br/>
learning shorthand (that was in the early 70s).  I used it in a couple of<br/>
jobs, but that was replaced by the Dictaphone.  Actually, I dictated rather<br/>
than transcribed.  That was replaced by the Magcard and the IBM<br/>
Displaywriter. Those were replaced by the PC and the Mac.  Then, we stopped<br/>
printing our letters and began sending them by e-mail.  We even file court<br/>
documents over the Internet.  All in the last 30 years.  Amazing.<br/>
<br/>
Our newspaper recently ran a list of obsolete skills.  Here&#39;s a website with<br/>
a great list:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://obsoleteskills.wikispot.org/Skills">http://obsoleteskills.wikispot.org/Skills</a><br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nearly everyone went to school. Is nearly everyone well rounded?<br/>
<br/>
If some people come out of school full of a little about a lot, is it  <br/>
because of school or because they naturally absorb what&#39;s put before  <br/>
them and/or are naturally curious about a lot of things?<br/>
<br/>
Is school necessary to be exposed to a lot of stuff?<br/>
<br/>
 From personal experience I think it&#39;s way better to be exposed in a  <br/>
fun casual way to things that leave a good feeling and could be  <br/>
picked up anytime in the future than to be subjected to a full  <br/>
version that may make someone avoid that subject. Just the mention of  <br/>
goodly chunks of American History and Silas Marner shut my brain down  <br/>
because of school.<br/>
<br/>
How many people avoid science and math and classic literature because  <br/>
of exposure in school?<br/>
<br/>
Does Shakespeare cause people to cringe because he&#39;s naturally cringe  <br/>
inducing or because he recalls memories of being made to read one his  <br/>
plays (which should be watched not read!) and analyzing something  <br/>
they didn&#39;t care about?<br/>
<br/>
One of the fallacies of people&#39;s thinking about school is in  <br/>
believing school is where I learned x so therefore all children can  <br/>
learn x there. Or ideally in school kids will learn y, therefore all  <br/>
kids can learn y by going to school.<br/>
<br/>
But school is an artificially recreated subset of the world. Way  <br/>
better to use the real world.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; DH believes that<br/>
&gt; this (hated) schooling made him well-rounded and helped him know a<br/>
&gt; little about a lot.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>While some of the interesting things I know surely I picked up in  <br/>
school since I was there for so many hours of my day (though I think  <br/>
very little of it I didn&#39;t also come across in real life), but the  <br/>
things that stuck are the things that interested me. School doesn&#39;t   <br/>
have an exclusive claim to what&#39;s interesting! In fact I found they  <br/>
not only sucked the life out of a lot of interesting things but I had  <br/>
to sit through hours of uninteresting stuff for a few tidbits that  <br/>
was interesting. The truly interesting stuff, the stuff that&#39;s stuck  <br/>
with me, is stuff I stumbled across on my own. And I could have used  <br/>
all those hours in school spent on stuff I don&#39;t now remember on  <br/>
learning other things that I would remember. (Maybe my brain would  <br/>
have exploded ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He takes pride in<br/>
&gt; his ability to make conversation with people having widely varied<br/>
&gt; interests. I think that DH wants the boys to have this same<br/>
&gt; capability.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think lots of parents want to give their kids the talents and  <br/>
abilities the parents have found the most useful. But will our  <br/>
children find them just as useful? While I too am full of a little  <br/>
about a lot, I can&#39;t hold a conversation to save my life ;-) And, as  <br/>
a former engineer and now writer, I don&#39;t need to. But I am really  <br/>
good at Jeopardy! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
What I see happening is that my daughter is reaching out for what  <br/>
*she* needs. The things *she* finds useful for the person she is. She  <br/>
will use the things she&#39;s naturally drawn to. My job is to  put  <br/>
things within her reach so that she can pick and choose what  <br/>
fascinates her. Unlike school, there isn&#39;t a reason for her to avoid  <br/>
something that interests her. And the things that don&#39;t interest her  <br/>
she either won&#39;t be using or will learn in order to do something else  <br/>
that interests her. (When you don&#39;t spend 12 years learning things  <br/>
that don&#39;t interest you, then it&#39;s not a big deal to pick up  <br/>
something in order to get to something else.)<br/>
