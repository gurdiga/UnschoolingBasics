<div id="ygrps-yiv-1376203697">Below is from Sandra Dodd. She is not on UnschoolingBasics, soI <br/>
frequently send her posts that I think are inspiring and that I think <br/>
could make a difference to someone else&#39;s unschooling life.<br/>
<br/>
They are enshrined forever at the glorious resource that is Sandra&#39;s <br/>
website. If you&#39;ve never been, you need to make a trip there. And if <br/>
you *have* been by before, you really need to go again: she adds <br/>
something almost every day.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a great place to send those who question unschooling: they can <br/>
read for days and weeks and months and still not cover the whole thing!<br/>
<br/>
Also not to miss: Joyce Fetteroll&#39;s site: www.JoyfullyRejoycing.com<br/>
<br/>
So, if you have a story about your unschooling teen, you may send it on <br/>
to Sandra directly, or just post it here, and I&#39;ll make sure it gets <br/>
moved there.<br/>

I put it there and will link to the main teen page. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Would you let your list know this and maybe ask if the are other <br/>
stories of people who didn&#39;t start unschooling until their kids were <br/>
older that I could add to that? <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks. <br/>
