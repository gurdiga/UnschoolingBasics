Cameron&#39;s 19. He&#39;s handling society just fine.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, when I was his age, I didn&#39;t handle things nearly as well.<br/>
<br/>
Granted, Cameron is still on the naive side---but that&#39;s OK. He really <br/>
expects the best out of others---at least as good as they will get from <br/>
him! He doesn&#39;t let other run all over him though---he&#39;s QUITE happy to <br/>
stand up for himself. Much more so than I would at his age. Authority <br/>
carried a LOT of weight with me: I would crumble if someone were &quot;in <br/>
authority.&quot; Cameron is happy to challenge *anyone* if that person is <br/>
*wrong*. Blows me away. Has had no problem asking for and justifying <br/>
raises or challenging &quot;how things are done.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Do you feel they will get a shock when others do not treat them the<br/>
way they are used to being treated at home?<br/>
<br/>

He IS shocked, and then he tries to fix it (just like at home).<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I have been raising my son that in society when you are given a task<br/>

<br/>
How do you prepare your child to deal with this? (Throwing your own <br/>
question back at you. &lt;g&gt;) Do you want  him to do whatever his boss or <br/>
professor says? WhatEVER?????<br/>
<br/>
You know, that was one of the problems with the Calley case (are y&#39;all <br/>
too young to remember that? &lt;g&gt;). William Cally was a lieuteant in the <br/>
US army during the Viet Nam war who said he was &quot;just following orders&quot; <br/>
when he and his men massacred over 300 civilians in the village of My <br/>
Lai. &quot;Just following orders&quot;---they were given a task and completed it <br/>
depite their feelings about it.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s a REALLY bad idea to do whatever task depite your feelings <br/>
about it. REALLY bad.<br/>
<br/>
I hope my boys never have that expectation!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-90785036">I have been raising my son that in society when you are given a task<br/>
(at work or in college etc) you are expected to complete it despite<br/>
your feelings on it. <br/>
<br/>
  ***<br/>
  First, while you may expected to complete it, you still have a choice not to.  The question is whether you want what the completed job will give you -- a paycheck, respect for your work, joy in accomplishing what you do, etc. <br/>
   <br/>
  And yes, I do think our kids wil be able to finish a task, keep a joy and manage in society.  I&#39;ve noticed that as my boys get older, they are more likely to complete what they start.  They&#39;re even more likely to take on tasks they wouldn&#39;t have in the past.  Earlier today, while I was hanging clothes to dry, Andy asked me to make pancakes.  I said I would as soon as I was free.  His next question was &#39;How do I make them myself?&quot;  I talked him thru it, calling out ingredients and amounts while I hung clothes.  He found things, mixed up and cooked the pancakes.  Even once I was done with the clothes, he continued to pour and flip pancakes.  Sunday I came home from a walk to find him scrubbing the toilet in the hall bathroom -- he&#39;d noticed it needed cleaning and did it himself.  He&#39;s beginning to show initiative, and does things my Mom had to force us to do!  All just because he sees thigns that need to be done.  <br/>
   <br/>
  It helps to have stories, too, of the adventures of grown unschoolers, too.  Kids who have gone to college, tackling classes they weren&#39;t crazy about, but because it was part of the curriculum; who&#39;ve found and held jobs, learning about how the &#39;real&#39; world does work along the way.  I&#39;m not worried about my kids managing the future -- well, at least not because of unschooling.  I expect they&#39;ll be much more adept at learning new skills on a job, and much more willing to do what&#39;s required of the job they&#39;ve chosen -- because as unschoolers, they&#39;re very aware that everything we do is a choice.  <br/>

not asked how you feel about something.. Nor are you asked if you want<br/>
to complete a particular task etc.***<br/>
<br/>
I am!  My boss asks me if I want certain projects and if I were to get stuck <br/>
she&#39;d finish a project for me.  I work at a job I like, I work only as much <br/>
as I want, I do only the jobs I want and so your statement isn&#39;t true of all <br/>
jobs!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
***Since this is how you are at home<br/>
do you feel they will be able to make the transition into a world that<br/>
may not and actually most likely will not support that way of thinking.***<br/>
<br/>
My son won&#39;t be transitioning into the world - he&#39;s been in the word for <br/>
fifteen years!  By the time he&#39;s out, living on his own he&#39;ll have spent his <br/>
whole life on this planet!&lt;g&gt;  He knows lots of different people, he&#39;s <br/>
already worked at several different jobs. (Critter sitter stuff)   He&#39;s been <br/>
in clubs and groups made up of all kinds of folks, adults, kids his age, <br/>
kids younger than him.   He knows not everyone thinks the way he does.<br/>
<br/>
***Do you feel they will get a shock when others do not treat them the<br/>
way they are used to being treated at home?***<br/>
<br/>
If someone treats him badly he has the confidence to deal with them in a <br/>
mature and rational manner.<br/>
<br/>
***I have been raising my son that in society when you are given a task<br/>
(at work or in college etc) you are expected to complete it despite<br/>
your feelings on it.***<br/>
<br/>
When the young military people were busted over the treatment of prisoners <br/>
at Abu Ghraib they said they were &quot;just doing their job.&quot;   When Adolf <br/>
Eichmann was on trial for crimes against humanity he insisted he was only <br/>
following orders.  I think it&#39;s a terrible mistake to believe we must follow <br/>
orders in spite of our own feelings about whatever we&#39;ve been asked to do. <br/>
(If you&#39;re interested in this idea there was a bizarre study called the <br/>
Milgram experiments (Stanley Milgram) that showed just how far some folks <br/>
would be willing to compromise their ethics if they were directed to by an <br/>
authority figure)  If my son is in a job where he doesn&#39;t feel good about <br/>
doing the work then I hope he leaves that job PRONTO.<br/>
<br/>
We have choices about what jobs we take and whether we stay at that job and <br/>
for how long.   I think the majority of the people who are having a hard <br/>
time in life are people who feel like they have no choice about what happens <br/>
to them or who feel like they *have to* do things in their life because they <br/>
have no choice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1232685738">I have had three who have gone from unschooling to college - two have <br/>
good jobs now. Not a one has had a big transition problem. They may <br/>
have had a surprise or two, but nothing they didn&#39;t understand or <br/>
have the ability to deal with.  We have unschooled for 20 years. I <br/>
worried about the first one going off to college at age 16 with no <br/>
&quot;formal schooling&quot; LOL. (State pays for it - he wanted to try it <br/>
badly, so off he went - just as a commuter student.) He ended up <br/>
staying there for four years, graduated and now works as a well paid <br/>
computer programmer in NC. The other one has transferred to another <br/>
college and is working towards a degree in mechanical engineering. <br/>
Their unschooling years really helped them focus on what THEY wanted <br/>
to do and what THEIR strengths were. One lived breathed and slept <br/>
with computers - and he&#39;s very good at what he does. The other loved <br/>
things mechanical! And he too is good at what he does. Had they been <br/>
in school all day all those years they never would have known where <br/>
their interests lie, at least I can&#39;t see how they could have. They <br/>
were free to really explore at home. And explore they did.<br/>

<br/>
On the surface asking a child to do something looks like a boss  <br/>
asking an employee to do something. But the underlying motivations  <br/>
are completely different. Children *know* this and it confuses them  <br/>
when parents try to treat the situations the same and get upset that  <br/>
kids aren&#39;t treating them the same.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you feel they will get a shock when others do not treat them the<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unlike school kids my daughter has been out in the world  <br/>
extensively ;-) She has friends who are unschooled and homeschooled  <br/>
and schooled. She has friends who are 10-89, She&#39;s also seen the  <br/>
world on TV :-) And read about it in books!<br/>
<br/>
She isn&#39;t living in a bubble. She&#39;s been exposed to people who treat  <br/>
each other differently than she is treated.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have been raising my son that in society when you are given a task<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It *really* isn&#39;t brain surgery. It&#39;s not a concept that needs  <br/>
drilled into them.<br/>
<br/>
Plus he knows -- perhaps subconsciously -- that there&#39;s a huge  <br/>
difference between a job imposed on him and a job he has willingly  <br/>
taken that he *wants* to do. He *will* treat being asked to interrupt  <br/>
what&#39;s important to him to do a favor to someone else differently  <br/>
than a task that&#39;s personally meaningful to him that he&#39;s *chosen* to  <br/>
do -- like beating a video game level, getting a jump right on a  <br/>
skateboard.<br/>
<br/>
I think one of the biggest flubs parents can make is to look at who  <br/>
their child is at the moment and assume that unless what are  <br/>
perceived as flaws are trained out of them that they&#39;ll be exactly as  <br/>
they are as adults.<br/>
<br/>
When your son couldn&#39;t walk, did you give him walking lessons,  <br/>
fearing he might never walk? When he couldn&#39;t say milk properly, did  <br/>
you immediately start lessons to insure that he didn&#39;t spend the rest  <br/>
of his life saying &quot;gook&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Children learn loads better if we trust that they can learn when it&#39;s  <br/>
important to them and that right now they&#39;re doing the best they can  <br/>
with the information, skills and needs they have right now.<br/>
<br/>
Kids don&#39;t learn responsibility by having jobs imposed on them and  <br/>
having someone hover over them to judge how well they do. How well  <br/>
would you learn if your husband decided you needed to manicure the  <br/>
lawn with scissors? Would you feel responsible after you&#39;d done it?  <br/>
Or would you feel resentful? Why? (It&#39;s important that why. It&#39;s the  <br/>
foundational difference between choosing to take on a responsibility  <br/>
and having someone impose a task on us.)<br/>
<br/>
Kids learn to be responsible by being treated with respect. When they  <br/>
know they&#39;re respected -- truly deeply respected for who they are and  <br/>
not just when they&#39;re doing what they parents approve of -- then they  <br/>
want to maintain that respect, the respect of others and even more  <br/>
importantly their respect for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
(And, yes, I&#39;ve seen a great deal of responsibility in my daughter at  <br/>
15. In fact I think she&#39;s way more responsible than I am!)<br/>

Mostly it will be his homework assignments or the work they are doing in<br/>

These are things that still have to be done.  Granted when unschooling you<br/>
have the option to alter things to make them more fun or acceptable to your<br/>

<br/>
I like a lot of what you say I really do.. I can see all the positives of<br/>
it.  However I have never dealt with so little actual structure and<br/>

What exactly do you think your child needs to do that he doesn&#39;t want or  <br/>
like to do?  Would you mind sharing some concrete examples?<br/>
 <br/>
I used to think that there were just so many things we had to do.  A  huge <br/>
part of my living a joyful life was the realization that there are really  few <br/>
things that we &quot;have&quot; to do.  It was a huge leap for me to realize that  not <br/>
doing something that I thought had to be done really didn&#39;t have the huge  <br/>
consequences that I imagined. Now, I know I can choose to do those  things <br/>
happily.......or not do them at all.<br/>
 <br/>
Some things that used to be on my list were things like showering, washing  <br/>
dishes, laundry, balancing my checkbook, going to the grocery store, getting  <br/>
dressed......I&#39;m not saying that my kids and I don&#39;t do those things but  <br/>
sometimes we just don&#39;t.  Nothing bad happens.   Really.   Sometimes, really cool <br/>
things happen.<br/>
 <br/>
I found that examining those notions of mine and actually seeing what does  <br/>
happen has opened up a whole new world for us.<br/>
 <br/>
What are some of the things you think need to be done?<br/>

I didn&#39;t read this post before I responded and didn&#39;t realize your child  was <br/>
in school.  So I guess my question would still be along the same  lines.  <br/>
What chores?  And what would happen if they didn&#39;t get  done?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-315387341">There have been many many threads about &quot;have tos&quot;.  I&#39;m sure you <br/>
can find a lot of stuff if you search under &quot;chores&quot; in the archives <br/>
or at other sites.<br/>
<br/>
But it really comes down to the fact that all of these things are <br/>
still choices.  He can choose to do the chores or not to do them.  <br/>
That is his choice.  And it is your choice to respond to his <br/>
choice.  You can choose to punish, discuss, ignore, whatever.  It is <br/>
still your choice.  <br/>
<br/>
Adults and kids certainly do choose to do things that they don&#39;t <br/>
particularly enjoy.  They may choose to do something in order to <br/>
avoid a punishment or negative result, or perhaps to help someone <br/>
they love.  I think it&#39;s super important to model making choices, <br/>
even with chores.  <br/>

Gotta go,<br/>

think it&#39;s building trust to force him to do things he doesn&#39;t want to<br/>

management coming along and treating us like we were stupid and not  <br/>
listening when we told them what the problem was, about half the  <br/>
people left for lunch and just never came back.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-166002855">The things Nate refuses to do is writing anything.  He hates to write.  I<br/>
mean anything.. I dont necessarily mean stories.  It seems the more the has<br/>
to do actual writing the more he gets emotionally upset.  So he doesnt<br/>
complete any of his work unless you sit there and make sure he finishes it.<br/>
<br/>
I have thought about how I would handle this at home.  He would learn how to<br/>
type.<br/>
<br/>
He has had issues with hand writing since he was first ever in school.  He<br/>
had a very very negative experience with a teacher and I believe it has left<br/>
a permanent mark on him.<br/>
<br/>
He will come home from school and whine about how much he had to write and<br/>
how his hand hurts.  I have spoken to doctors about it but nothing was ever<br/>
found.<br/>
<br/>
He only really has one chore.  To take out the trash.  I dont enforce really<br/>
any other chore for him.  I wanted him to have one thing that he is solely<br/>
responsible for.  It doesnt require alot of attention. It is over quickly.<br/>
All other chores I have tried with him he takes 5 hours because he is so<br/>
distracted or in another world.<br/>
<br/>
It is becoming quite an issue between my children too.  My daughter does her<br/>
chores quickly and completely where as Nate doesnt finish anything.. Well<br/>
unless he is building something with Legos or making paper airplanes.<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to say I wasnt implyng that unschooled children wouldnt be<br/>
able to transition.  I think alot if not most of them would do smoothly but<br/>
how did they handle the culture shock.  I guess I am more worried about how<br/>
my Nate would transition into society (not general everyday society but<br/>
adult/work society) where someone isnt there to make sure he is taking his<br/>
medication, bathing, eating right, sleeping enough, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I have read that unschooled children tend to be more successful<br/>
intrapersonally then conventional schooled children. I for some reason<br/>
believed (and I am sorry for my assumption) that unschooled kids mainly<br/>
associated with other unschooled kids.  Not that they never associated with<br/>
others but I meant primarily.  I think I got that idea from my aunt-in-law<br/>
who homeschools and her girls mainly associate with a specific grouping of<br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
I have my first meeting to see how the school responds to the services Nate<br/>
needs.  Should they give me a really hard time I will just forgo the<br/>
doctor&#39;s recommendation and bring him home for schooling.  I know he would<br/>
be successful at home with so much but I am worried about him developing<br/>
socially.  I dont live in an area with alot of extra curricular activities.<br/>
I would have to travel a bit.  We dont have any extra money so I am limited<br/>
there. (cost of travel etc).  So that is the only thing I am worried about.<br/>
Would I be stunting his social development.  Granted he isnt getting much at<br/>
school other then some teasing.<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry I am just rambling.  I am kinda in that mood today.  It has been<br/>
a long road with Nate.  I love him so much and my heart aches to see him<br/>
have it so very hard compared to his peers.  Even when he is playing with<br/>
his cousin you can see the difference in their maturities.  Nate always<br/>
looks so hurt and confused.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry again for rambling.<br/>

him.  Not be able to sleep because his mind is racing so fast it makes him<br/>
scream for it to stop.  These are things that despite whether you really<br/>
want to or not you have to do.. Because the alternative is so horrible.<br/>
<br/>
I had to go home for 3 months without my boy because he wanted to die.  It<br/>
was the worst 3 months of my entire existence.  I didn&#39;t want to go home<br/>
without him but I did it because it was what HAD to be done for him to get<br/>
better.  Yes it was a choice.. everything is a choice..<br/>
<br/>
So I think about what if my son was dead a lot.. because he has wanted to be<br/>
dead.<br/>
<br/>
If I allowed my son to do what he wanted to do he would never get out of bed<br/>
because of his fears.  He needs to face his fears and learn he is stronger<br/>
then they are.  I should give him the choice to never leave the house for<br/>
fears of things outdoors?<br/>
<br/>
My son has instant gratification needs and if he doesn&#39;t get it right or<br/>
becomes the best at it when he first does it he quits.  He has a major<br/>
emotional breakdown over it.  I should let him just give up on everything<br/>
that is a challenge because he isn&#39;t the best at it?<br/>
<br/>
I am very encouraging but insistent.  I want him to complete the things he<br/>
starts.  I want him to keep trying and learn through repetition you can<br/>
become just as good and sometimes better then others.<br/>

Why would you aid and assist the damage the schools are inflicting on<br/>
this child???? WHY?  If he doesn&#39;t do the work, then he is choosing<br/>
not to do the work? Why would it matter if he chooses to ignore work<br/>
that isn&#39;t beneficial for him nor is it teaching  him anything but a<br/>
distaste for learning. ugh.<br/>
<br/>
Let him choose his school experiences (why is he in school anyway???),<br/>
let him own that experience and choose what he gets from it. If he<br/>
fails, that is NOT a reflection of who he is or how intelligent he is.<br/>
Counter the school damage and focus on what he LOVES, not what he<br/>
CAN&#39;T do!!!<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like this child has been seen as a failure on many levels.<br/>
He needs to shine in someone&#39;s eyes. He needs to have his strengths<br/>
focused on, NOT his weaknesses. He needs to know he is perfect and<br/>
beautiful right NOW.  <br/>
<br/>
Take out the trash for him and say &quot;I know how you hate taking out the<br/>
trash sweetheart, so I did it for you today&quot; and then do it again<br/>
tomorrow!! Does the trash matter more than your son&#39;s spirit...because<br/>
he&#39;s being crushed over really meaningless crap.<br/>

  ****<br/>
  My oldest son hated to write in school -- and his handwriting was way below the school&#39;s expectations.  I let it go.  How many men do we know who really have nice handwriting anyway?  The few I know tell horrible stories of they &#39;learned&#39; to write -- most involve nuns and rulers. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
   <br/>
  Now, at 22, my firstborn has the neatest, smallest print writing -- it&#39;s like looking at a book.  Somewhere around 15, he started writing down song lyrics he wanted to remember, and to make it all fit on the page, he had to come up with tiny writing.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Andy, who&#39;s almost 11, just began writing all kinds of things -- spontaneously -- after months of saying he &#39;couldn&#39;t write&#39; and asking us to write things for him.  Now, he&#39;s making lists of pokemon characters, schedules for his juggling practice (his idea and schedule, not ours) and more.  Because, now he was ready.  He might keep up with it, or he might leave it by the wayside for the next pursuit, but he knows &#39;how&#39; and will do it when he needs it.<br/>
   <br/>
  My point is, writing will come -- when your son is ready and needs it.  <br/>
   <br/>
  ****<br/>
  I have thought about how I would handle this at home. He would learn how to<br/>
type.<br/>
   <br/>
  Or maybe not -- typing, too, will come when he&#39;s ready and when it meets his needs.  It need not come on anyone else&#39;s agenda.  <br/>

able to transition. I think alot if not most of them would do smoothly but<br/>
how did they handle the culture shock. I guess I am more worried about how<br/>
my Nate would transition into society (not general everyday society but<br/>
adult/work society) where someone isnt there to make sure he is taking his<br/>
medication, bathing, eating right, sleeping enough, etc.<br/>
<br/>
  He&#39;s medicated?  For behavioral/ADD issues?  Those medications can make a huge impact -- and not a good one, IMO -- on kids.  From the school problems you&#39;ve shared, and your concerns about his &#39;distractibility&#39; I&#39;m beginning to see a little boy with a lot of impositions on his life and spirit.  All those impositions lead to frustration, anger and resentment on the part of any person, especially a small child who has to feel powerless against the system that&#39;s telling there&#39;s something &#39;wrong&#39; with him.  Poor little guy!<br/>
   <br/>
  *****<br/>
   <br/>
  I have my first meeting to see how the school responds to the services Nate needs. Should they give me a really hard time I will just forgo the doctor&#39;s recommendation and bring him home for schooling. I know he would be successful at home with so much but I am worried about him developing socially. I dont live in an area with alot of extra curricular activities.<br/>
I would have to travel a bit. We dont have any extra money so I am limited there. (cost of travel etc). So that is the only thing I am worried about. Would I be stunting his social development. Granted he isnt getting much at school other then some teasing.<br/>
<br/>
  ****<br/>
  I&#39;ve been down the testing road -- with my oldest son when he was 8.  It was awful, and they didn&#39;t even find anything to label Will with.  As to whether they give you a &#39;really hard time&#39; -- my concern would be what kind of time are they giving Nate?  And how are you adding to his burden by being their agent for coercion of your son?  <br/>
   <br/>
  It sounds to me like you know he&#39;d do better at home.  Go with your instincts -- bring him home, and let him blossom.  I&#39;d also re-visit the meds situation, too.  I know that if we had Andy in school, they&#39;d be pushing meds -- heck, he&#39;d need meds just to be in school!  It wouldnt&#39; be the right thing for Andy&#39;s soul.  He is just perfectly wonderful, exactly as he is right now.  School isn&#39;t a place that could embrace or appreciate Andy for who he is, and the constant stuffing of his light would eat at his soul, in a thousand ways.  <br/>
   <br/>
  *****<br/>
  I am sorry I am just rambling. I am kinda in that mood today. It has been a long road with Nate. I love him so much and my heart aches to see him have it so very hard compared to his peers. Even when he is playing with his cousin you can see the difference in their maturities. Nate always looks so hurt and confused.<br/>
<br/>
  ****<br/>
  Make it your goal to relieve his hurt and confusion.  Find ways to celebrate his shine, his unique gifts to and from the universe.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Have you been over to the Shine with unschooling list?  Not because you&#39;ve described Nate as &#39;special&#39; (there&#39;s a confusion that Shine is about specially-diagnosed kids) but because over at Shine <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/shinewithunschooling.">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/shinewithunschooling.</a> you&#39;ll find lots of wonderful stories of how all kids shine with unschooling.  It&#39;s a wonderful place to find and celebrate Nate&#39;s -- and your own -- shine.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1616944572">First off I&#39;d say &quot;Get him out of school!&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Then,<br/>
<br/>
***The things Nate refuses to do is writing anything.  He hates to write.  I<br/>
 mean anything.. I dont necessarily mean stories.  It seems the more the has<br/>
 to do actual writing the more he gets emotionally upset.  ***<br/>
<br/>
Then don&#39;t make him write anything.  Help him to do things without the writing. Really.  If he wants to get something accomplished he will do what it takes.  But if he&#39;s had that slammed on him all this time in school it might take a long time for him to want to write again.<br/>
<br/>
My son (14) also hates to write.  He rarely writes.  Sometimes he worries about it, but we talk about and he knows we&#39;ll help him figure out something when the need arises.  I tell him I know he&#39;ll be just fine either way, writing or not writing.  I think for him he worries about doing it so perfectly. From his life pre-unschooling, I truly believe he&#39;s scared to write and then on top of that its not something he likes to do.  (I hate writing too :)  Yet, I&#39;m a very proficient typer. :D  We let him know that there are lots of people out there who scribble their signature,  there are lots of people who rarely write and they are happy and getting through life just fine.<br/>
<br/>
Try and help him to see that he&#39;s OK and wonderful in being just who he is.  Even if he doesn&#39;t want to write right now,  that&#39;s OK.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
***He only really has one chore.  To take out the trash.  I dont enforce really<br/>
 any other chore for him.  I wanted him to have one thing that he is solely<br/>
 responsible for.  It doesnt require alot of attention. It is over quickly.<br/>
 All other chores I have tried with him he takes 5 hours because he is so<br/>
 distracted or in another world.***<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d get rid of chores too.  I hope you read at Joyce&#39;s site.  Its so amazing what a shift in perspective you can get from looking at things from a point of joy instead of a world of &quot;have-tos&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Really, I hope that you can get him out of school now and then spend some time with him, talk and listen and just let him be him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1977887937">To answer your question.. NO I didnt have a choice in taking him<br/>
home.. Well I suppose I did.. I could have tried and been arrested. <br/>
When a child is found to have suicidal thoughts or attempts it is<br/>
considered so emergent that the rights of the parents to take that<br/>
child home is taken away.  I was told if I tried to remove him I would<br/>
have been arrested and my child put in protective custody.  They<br/>
believed that it was safest for the child to be under constant<br/>
psychiatric care and supervision until the child shows no desires to<br/>
kill them self.<br/>
<br/>
It broke my heart to leave him there but I knew he was getting the<br/>
attention from a professional he needed.  We learned he was bipolar<br/>
and needed medication to control his moods.  he is not on<br/>
antidepressants.. He is on medication to control his mood swings.<br/>
<br/>
Why is my son in school?<br/>
<br/>
Well to be honest up until recently I have never heard of unschooling<br/>
and only heard of homeschooling from one other family.  <br/>
<br/>
I have only known conventional schooling.  I am still trying to<br/>
understand everything that is involved with unschooling and<br/>
homeschooling.  It may seem so simple to you but not to someone who<br/>
has never heard of it before.  I am trying to get as much information<br/>
as I can.   I do want to do what is best for my children and I am not<br/>
going to just blindly make decisions.<br/>
<br/>
For the most part I raise my kids with their feelings in mind but<br/>
there are certain things I have always believed the parent knew best.<br/>
 It was how I was raised.  To choose to go against that is to question<br/>
how I was raised and who I am as a person.  I am doing this but it<br/>
isnt something I take lightly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ren,<br/>
<br/>
I think your wording is a bit harsh for someone who is trying to<br/>
understand this whole world and make a decision to enter it.  I dont<br/>
know if that is your intention but that is how it feels.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How about trying to understand what it was like before making a harsh<br/>
statement.  What parent wants their child to suffer at any time.  You<br/>
dont think you are making your child suffer.  You believe and trust<br/>
that you are doing what is best for your child to keep them safe.  <br/>
<br/>
I dont know if this is the community for me if you are going to be so<br/>
rude and harsh about what a parent felt was best for their child.  I<br/>
am always trying to do what is best for my child.  Sometimes it takes<br/>
time to learn what is best.  That is why I am considering bringing him<br/>
home.. But that is a big life altering decision that I have to think<br/>
about how he would handle it and is it really what is best for him..<br/>
Do I believe it is best for him?  Yes about 99% sure. there are a<br/>
couple things that I am worried about.. That is why I came here.  But<br/>
I feel like I am looked down upon because I made choices you feel were<br/>
wrong.  <br/>
<br/>
I am trying to understand this way of thinking.  I wanted guidance and<br/>
understanding and support in making a transition.. Not judgement of my<br/>
fears and concerns.<br/>
<br/>
I feel for the most part I have gotten that but from some you are so<br/>
harsh in your words.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1790159226">Robin,<br/>
<br/>
These are all natural concerns for those who are first getting<br/>
interested in unschooling.  One thing that always caught my attention<br/>
was when somebody pointed out to me how artificial the &#39;socializing&#39;<br/>
at school was.<br/>
<br/>
For some reason we think that having our children associate with lots<br/>
of children of the same age is &#39;socializing.&#39;  However, that is a far<br/>
cry from the reality each and every one of us live every day.  A<br/>
family (especially extended families) tends to be a lot more<br/>
indicative of the way we socialize as adults than school could ever be.  <br/>
<br/>
What you write here seems to indicate that you understand this<br/>
intuitively, but maybe it just hasn&#39;t fully sunk in yet (or you don&#39;t<br/>
believe it because you haven&#39;t experienced it):<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have read that unschooled children tend to be more successful<br/>
&gt; intrapersonally then conventional schooled children.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In regards to extra curriculars, etc, these don&#39;t have to cost a lot<br/>
of money.  For starters, simply spending some time in public places or<br/>
going to the park are not only great opportunities to socialize with<br/>
people of all ages, but also great unschooling opportunities.<br/>
<br/>
Your child will socialize whether you actively try or not.  It might<br/>
be when the two of you go to the grocery store or run errands, it<br/>
might be when talking with a neighbor or visiting a friend, it could<br/>
simply be talking on the phone with extended family (if they&#39;re not<br/>
local).<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s tons of opportunities to &#39;socialize&#39; with people of all ages<br/>
if you remove yourself from the assumption/expectation that a school<br/>
is the best place for children to socialize.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is very much about thinking outside the box, so use this<br/>
opportunity to see if you can find solutions that will help you feel<br/>
enabled to curb your fears and meet your child&#39;s needs more<br/>
effectively than school does.<br/>

<br/>
You could do it for him. Seriously. There was a three week period <br/>
when my stepson moved in where his mom wouldn&#39;t let us pull him out <br/>
of school. So I did his homework for him. His grades didn&#39;t get any <br/>
worse in that time period - he actually got higher scores on the <br/>
tests he took during that time, and I&#39;m convinced the reduction of <br/>
stress was a big part of that. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Wow, what a great example of the difference between chosen work and <br/>
imposed work! He *has* the ability and attention to finish projects -<br/>
 the trouble is you are not asigning value to his projects. <br/>
<br/>
This statement of yours is also a good look at why you can&#39;t make <br/>
assumptions about how unschooling will look in your home based on <br/>
how a kid responds to schooling and imposed chores. Ray fought and <br/>
fought and fought against both - he &quot;looked&quot; alot like your <br/>
descriptions of Nate. Now, after six months of deschooling, he&#39;s <br/>
practically exploding with new projects and ideas. He&#39;s drawing and <br/>
painting and manipulating digital images. He&#39;s writing programs and <br/>
exploring other languages and cultures. He&#39;s waterskiing and <br/>
learning to use a fire-staff. The other day he spent two hours in <br/>
the woodshop making a staff for a guest bc she left hers home. He <br/>
learned to use a new powertool in the process. He&#39;s cooking and <br/>
cleaning without ever being *made* to do so - although he has asked <br/>
us to remind him to do the dishes. He *wants* to help. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have read that unschooled children tend to be more successful<br/>
&gt; intrapersonally then conventional schooled children. I for some <br/>

 </span></blockquote>mainly<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; associated with other unschooled kids.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My kids don&#39;t *know* very many unschooled kids. Mo knows a handful, <br/>
but they all live an hour or more away from us. Ray knows no <br/>
unschoolers his age irl - although he&#39;s met some online. They both <br/>
spend more time with adults than kids in general. They both have <br/>
really great social skills for dealing with adults - including the <br/>
ability to gently deflect adults who are condescending and <br/>
belittling to them.<br/>
<br/>
 Mo&#39;s better at asking for help with social situations she&#39;s not <br/>
comfortable exploring on her own, but that may be as much a matter <br/>
of personality. Ray&#39;s an extrovert, so he tends to dive in and <br/>
figure things out in the middle, as it were. That got him into <br/>
trouble when he was expected to &quot;be respectful&quot; to adults in <br/>
particular, but also in a lot of kid situations where he was <br/>
expected to behave in certain ways. Ironically, now that he&#39;s not <br/>
struggling against those expectations he&#39;s far more tactful and <br/>
gracious, even with people he doesn&#39;t like or disagrees with. I&#39;ve <br/>
seen him &quot;work as a team&quot; with people he barely knows to get a job <br/>
done more efficiently, whereas half a year ago he would have done <br/>
his passive-agressive best to make a mess of things to &quot;get out of&quot; <br/>
having to help.<br/>

<br/>
Right now I&#39;m more concerned about the harshness your child is<br/>

better about your choices. That IS harsh. I understand.<br/>
<br/>
But your child is in a world of hurt and YOU can stop it. I could pat<br/>
you on the back and tell you everything is ok, but it&#39;s not. I totally<br/>
understand that this is a lot to take in, but you&#39;ve only got a few<br/>
years left before this child is a legal adult, only a few short years<br/>
to try and mend relationships and damaged self-esteem. <br/>
<br/>
I hope my words can reach through some of the crud you (and most of<br/>
us) have learned that are lies and do what is best for your child. He<br/>
is hurting badly. YOu have the power to change that. Do it.<br/>
