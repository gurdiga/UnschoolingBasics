<div id="ygrps-yiv-1199757831">I had a pretty horrible experience this evening and am pretty shaken<br/>
up. My friend next doors 5.5yr old girl was diagnosed a few weeks ago<br/>
with pinworms, her mom was so freaked out about it, and trying to help<br/>
I said that maybe since she went to an intro to Kindergarten thing in<br/>
the summer that could be why she got it and her 6yr old bro didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
So I thought she was acting strange and avoiding me, and my sons<br/>
friend said his mom was saying the worms came from my younger<br/>
daughters and when I went over to assure my next door friend that my<br/>
girls have never had it she tore strips off me.<br/>
<br/>
She told me my kids were dirty and unvaccinated, that her kids were<br/>
not allowed round mine anymore, that my house is dirty and that my<br/>
11yo says he has no homework and that upsets her 6yo son who has<br/>
homework. That she is starting a daycare at home and it is illegal for<br/>
my unvaccinated kids to be around there, and that since my kids have<br/>
been in her house before, she has sterilised everything. When I tried<br/>
to say that my kids are rarely sick she said that their immunity is<br/>
good because the house is dirty. She said my 4yo must have dirty<br/>
diseases cause she likes to go about all day naked in the house, I can<br/>
just now get her to put clothes on for outside. Her 5.5yo daughter and<br/>
the little 4yo girl from across the street were listening to it all<br/>
and when her daughter reached out to my 1yo in my arms her mom pulled<br/>
her away. She was very loud, angry and rude to me and then slammed the<br/>
door in my face.<br/>
<br/>
I was so shook up I came home and cried, I could hardly speak through<br/>
sobbing when I called my DH at work to tell him. I have so few friends<br/>
in the area that it is a real shock to be treated that way.<br/>
<br/>
So I guess I am posting this here because maybe some of you can give<br/>
me a bit of insight or comfort as to how to deal with some one<br/>
attacking with &quot;dirty, freaky, unvaccinated homeschoolers&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And now how to deal with my children being left out and several moms<br/>
deciding I am to blame for their kids contagious illness? My 6yo<br/>
overheard me on the phone and said &quot;who says we are dirty mommy?&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1257918372">Well, to make you feel better, read this<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.emedicinehealth.com/pinworms/article_em.htm">http://www.emedicinehealth.com/pinworms/article_em.htm</a><br/>
Pinworms are extremely common and so easy to get, the daughter could  <br/>
have gotten it from a dozen different sources. And it&#39;s very likely  <br/>
that everyone in the family has it, just not the same symptoms,  <br/>
because it is so contagious. And I&#39;m evil enough to take satisfaction  <br/>
from that. Sigh. I&#39;m not very evolved as a person.<br/>
<br/>
I dealt with the dirty and unvaccinated and unschooler judgements by  <br/>
not hanging out with people who would judge me as such. I found  <br/>
really good friends through online groups for natural parenting, etc,  <br/>
and that has helped tremendously. That doesn&#39;t mean that you won&#39;t  <br/>
come across those types of people, in fact, one of our local group  <br/>
members got a hideous, detailed email of everything that was wrong  <br/>
with her after a gathering at her house, it was very hurtful, and she  <br/>
really needed us to reaffirm with her that her choices are GOOD and  <br/>
that her values are her own, and that no one has the right to judge.<br/>
<br/>
Please please please, help yourself by finding local groups, and if  <br/>
the kids say something about feeling left out by neighborhood kids,  <br/>
they will at least have the friends from your groups. Our kids  <br/>
actually don&#39;t hang out with too many kids from our neighborhood.  <br/>
they&#39;ll talk to them at the park or something, but there&#39;s only two  <br/>
kids from our neighborhood that come over the play. We import the  <br/>
rest ;-)<br/>
WIsh we were closer.<br/>

Ouch. I&#39;m so sorry you had to endure such a painful experience Cara. I<br/>
really try to surround myself with people that understand and support<br/>
our choices. It&#39;s not always easy to find them, but they&#39;re out there.<br/>
Even if they aren&#39;t unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
One of our close family friends is a Christian homeschooling Mom<br/>
(mostly homeschooling only because of custody/ex issues) and she is <br/>
SO supportive and understanding of our choices. Ya just never know.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1836108877">She sounds like a very ignorant woman.  Pinworms are a VERY common<br/>
thing in children, and come of walking barefoot and stepping where<br/>
pinworms (usually where animals have gone to the bathroom).  My home,<br/>
growing up, was immaculate, yet I had pinworms as a child.<br/>

And sterilizing things because an unvaccinated (but not ill) child was<br/>
there?  She just created more work for herself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-71818144">Cara - <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so sorry you and your kids had to experience this. It&#39;s hard when<br/>
faced with any kind of prejudice and close-mindedness.<br/>
<br/>
This may not be true for you in this situation, but I have always<br/>
thought of people who vocalize against choices I&#39;ve made as a mirror,<br/>
showing me that small voice of doubt within myself. It&#39;s an<br/>
opportunity for me to look within, and see if anything they&#39;re saying<br/>
resonates as truth for me. I&#39;ve found that the further along I am on<br/>
this unschooling journey, the less I hear things like that. And if I<br/>
do, they really just roll off my back. I have more confidence now that<br/>
we&#39;ve been doing this for 7 years.<br/>
<br/>
My ego is especially adept at finding those places where I still have<br/>
doubts and am still hanging on to old ways of doing things (in my<br/>
mind, if not in my actions). Invariably, *those* are the things that<br/>
are brought up to me by someone else<br/>
<br/>
I teach West African drumming and lead drum circles. Just recently, a<br/>
friend - someone who I really enjoyed being around, enjoyed her energy<br/>
- basically called me out for teaching West African drumming, saying I<br/>
should leave that for the African-American teachers. (She is<br/>
African-American, I am white.) It&#39;s yet another thing stolen from<br/>
African Americans, in other words, by white people who could afford to<br/>
travel to West Africa and learn from teachers there. I was shocked to<br/>
see this belief being expressed by her. Our conversation came at the<br/>
same time I was taking a class at my church, looking at racism inside<br/>
me and inside our community, and in the history of our city. No<br/>
coincidence there! She was giving voice to those whisperings of doubt<br/>
I carried in myself. I took a lot of time with coming to my own truth<br/>
about what she was saying, really spending a lot of time in prayer and<br/>
meditation, talking to other drummers, other black women, etc. What<br/>
has come about as a result is my further confidence in what I&#39;m doing<br/>
- there are kids who might *never* hear West African rhythms if I<br/>
didn&#39;t bring them to their school or camp. I have this knowledge - I<br/>
am supposed to share it. If someone were to confront me now, I&#39;d be<br/>
even more secure in my choice to teach - a gift of that most difficult<br/>
encounter with my friend.<br/>
<br/>
So - if someone is expressing doubt in my choices, if I am secure in<br/>
those choices it doesn&#39;t blow me about in that storm of judgement - I<br/>
can let them be where they are. It&#39;s when I have doubt about those<br/>
choices that it really shakes me up, and it&#39;s an opportunity for me to<br/>
look within, and find the truth for myself. It becomes less important<br/>
what others think of me or my choices when I am at peace.<br/>
<br/>
peace to you - <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Since you brought it up, I&#39;d like to gently suggest looking at the <br/>
whole &quot;poodle&quot; thing and thinking about it from a more compassionate <br/>
direction. Yeah, its a fun image, but it doesn&#39;t help you (I know *you* <br/>
weren&#39;t the one who talked to her, but I have a feeling you&#39;ve met <br/>
other &quot;poodles&quot;). Usually when someone freaks out that impressively <br/>
that person is expressing a whole lot of fears and insecurities all at <br/>
once. If you think of you own insecurities around your kids and their <br/>
well-being, its possible to connect with the *feelings* even if the <br/>
ways they were expressed was.....less than generous to say the least!<br/>
<br/>
One of the interesting things about RU is how many people report <br/>
becomming more sensitive and compassionate to other adults in the <br/>
process of learning to have better relationships with our kids. The <br/>
same principles really apply to all human relationships - look for the <br/>
underlying needs, seek to communicate (not just talk), assume positive <br/>
intent first, and trust that the other person is doing the best she can <br/>
with what she has in the moment. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s more, but right <br/>
now.... the sunshine is calling me!!<br/>

Hey, Cara...we are the same as you :) It&#39;s ok - cry and cry and let those  <br/>
coping chemicals come out, so you can get fierce and strong again on the outside <br/>
 as you are on the inside. You&#39;re ok. As much as that hurt (and what a mean,  <br/>
nasty, small minded woman! ) you are learning from this event. Sigh. How <br/>
awful.  I wish I could come see you in your dirty home, lol, with my dirty, <br/>
freaky,  unvaxe&#39;d kids and the little ones could play out back naked all darn day! I <br/>
have  a friend that was SO freaked out in general, we weren&#39;t allowed to see <br/>
her baby  until her baby had been vaccinated. At least however, we were not <br/>
excluded, she  said the same about ALL children (it makes no sense, but try <br/>
telling her that!  Especially since she allowed adults over...ACK!)<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t have much to say, but I really wanted to send love across the ocean  <br/>
to you. I&#39;m so sorry that there are people that are so uneducated and so  <br/>
hurtful. You and your I bet BEAUTIFUL family are the healthy and wonderful  family <br/>
we all need living next door to us. <br/>
 <br/>
Hang in there, ok? I look forward to reading the responses from  others.<br/>
 <br/>
Love,<br/>
Karen<br/>
(PS - in school, my daughter brought home pin worms WAY too many times, but  <br/>
it&#39;s NOT from being anything other than a tactile kid...that woman needs to  <br/>
learn what they are and how they are dealt with! Grr! Makes me want to spit  <br/>
nails as my mom would say, lol!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1643416502">lovely intent, but i&#39;m afraid i&#39;m not that deep. my experience of people is that there are two kinds those who are genuinely reasonable  and those who fall into differing categories. i never seek to blame or force my opinions upon anyone else, and i get very cross when they have done it to me. so i&#39;m really glad that you can deal with it the way that you do, its very noble......i&#39;d rather just tell someone who was so extraordinarily rude to get lost...i have neither the time, nor the inclination to decipher their underlying root fears and insecurities.lol, yes i have met lots of poodles in my time, some i&#39;ve viewed from a distance one or two in my contacts, and not once have i sought to learn anything from anyone so ignorant. good that you can though, thats what makes us such a rich tapestry of different beings.

<br/>
She has probably taken pride in being a good mom, keeping her house <br/>
clean and her kids &quot;safe.&quot; She&#39;s had an upset and her world is spinning <br/>
right now because her kid has worms and your &quot;dirty&quot; kids are healthy.  <br/>
She&#39;s embarrassed and feeling like it&#39;s unfair that she tries so hard <br/>
to be a good mom while you&#39;re relaxed and her kid is the one with <br/>
worms.  That&#39;s a big blow to her. She&#39;s afraid of looking like a bad <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1694640903">I&#39;m sorry to hear that. I can definitely relate.I have heard similar <br/>
negative comments from my family. They are constantly giving me a <br/>
hard time about the way we raise our children (and they accuse me of <br/>
being close-minded!). Just a couple weeks ago my grandfather was in <br/>
the hospital and I was told by my grandmother and mom they didn&#39;t <br/>
want my kids visiting him because they are not vacinated. That <br/>
really hurt. <br/>
I have learned to keep my distance and surround myself and the kids <br/>
with like-minded people.<br/>
I also think she was probably upset her kid had worms and just <br/>
wanted someone to blame. Just keep your head up and don&#39;t let others <br/>
misery drag you down. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1242749387">My daughter just got diagnosed with pinworms too. I admit to <br/>
experiencing some temporary pinworm insanity myself. At least I hope <br/>
it&#39;s temporary :-) . I feel overwhelmed when dealing with researching <br/>
which meds are safe for babies, trying to imagine how I will manage <br/>
the extra laundry, morning showers for everyone etc. for the next few <br/>
weeks. Reading about medication resistant pinworm strains, natural <br/>
remedies vs. medical remedies and dietary susceptibilty patterns is <br/>
making my head spin. Some people don&#39;t have very good coping skills <br/>
and need someone to blame and lash out at when they are very <br/>
stressed. Maybe she&#39;ll be mortified once the insanity passes. If it <br/>
passes...&quot;pinworm neurosis&quot; is apparently a real thing which can last <br/>
long after the worms are gone.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

My 9yo son just got diagnosed with celiac disease and the parasite<br/>
Giardia, probably cause his immune system is very weak from the<br/>
celiac. We used Dr Christophers Herbal Parasite Syrup with good<br/>
results and no side effects. The girl next door got mebendazole for<br/>
the pinworms and felt sick and had a two day bad headache. If you want<br/>
more info about the Dr Christoper stuff drop me a line and I can send<br/>
you the links, I couldnt figure out haw to email u off group about this!<br/>
