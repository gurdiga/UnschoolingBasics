<div id="ygrps-yiv-411650338">Hi Everyone, <br/>
<br/>
My name is Janice and I am the wife of Glen, and the mother of 4 <br/>
boys: Paul- 14.5, Shawn-12, Eric-9, Collin-8(in 2 wks), and Joshua-6<br/>
(in 2 wks).<br/>
<br/>
We recently attended the Peabody Unschooling Conference to try to <br/>
help us decide whether or not the unschooling life was really what <br/>
we were after or not.  The conference made reference to this web <br/>
group, so here I am.  We have been homeschooling for 5 years now and <br/>
this past year have tentatively been trying out the unschooling <br/>
lifestyle.  I have known about unschooling since the start of our <br/>
homeschooling journey and have always been intrigued by it, but was <br/>
somewhat hesitant to try it.  All of my children are VERY <br/>
introverted.  They would prefer to never leave the confines of our <br/>
home for any reason, and this makes me somewhat shy of unschooling.  <br/>
They have NO friends whatsoever.  Even at the conference, they spent <br/>
as much time as they possibly could hiding in our hotel room.<br/>
<br/>
Could someone please convince me that this will work for our family?<br/>
<br/>
Also, my husband is still on the fence about even traditional <br/>
homeschooling methods and this makes him even more nervous.  He has <br/>
agreed to &quot;go with the flow&quot; for now, but both of us need <br/>
reassurance about this lifestyle.  Just for information purposes, <br/>
one of the things that makes us the most hesitant is in regards to <br/>
reading - my 3 youngest still do not read AT ALL, and my 12 yr old <br/>
can read (but probably not at what most would consider &quot;grade <br/>
level&quot;) but hates to read for any reason.<br/>
<br/>
Any insights would be appreciated.<br/>

being by themselves?  What do you do now?  It seems like with their ages<br/>
that they have created their own social structure.  That&#39;s ok if it brings<br/>
joy in their lives.  If pushing them out the door to force them to be social<br/>
is going to bring fear or distrust then I would be hesitant to tell you to<br/>
just &quot;go for it&quot; and find ways to bring socialism in their lives.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Janice,<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the group!  I wanted to address this concern of yours <br/>
with a question.  If you decide against unschooling and choose <br/>
traditional homeschooling, how would that help your boys become more <br/>
social?  What kind of homeschooling have you been doing?  Forgive <br/>
this assumption, but if it was working well for you, I don&#39;t think <br/>
you&#39;d be looking into unschooling, right?  :)<br/>
<br/>
My son is very introverted as well.  We&#39;ve been homeschooling over 4 <br/>
years and no matter what type of homeschooling we&#39;ve tried, his <br/>
personality hasn&#39;t changed.  However, since our family lifestyle has <br/>
moved into radical unschooling, he&#39;s become a happier little boy.  <br/>
He&#39;s slowly opening up, trusting us more because he is learning that <br/>
we won&#39;t force him to do things he really doesn&#39;t want to do.<br/>
<br/>
Time to get ready for dinner.  Glad to see you here and asking <br/>
questions.  The people on this list are so great.  I wish I could <br/>
attend an unschooling conference!  It&#39;s just not going to work out <br/>
this year though.  :)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It will work. But you&#39;ve got to stop &quot;tentatively&quot; unschooling. Come on, jump in. The water&#39;s fine! You&#39;ve got to really give it a go to see the benefits and appreciate the learning. We can&#39;t convince you, but your kids will if you give them the chance. Introverted or extroverted doesn&#39;t matter. What matters is a home that supports interests, passions, wishes and dreams. That&#39;s where the learning will happen.<br/>
<br/>
Keep reading here and asking questions as they come up. Lots of us have been unschooling for years. We *know* it works. Come here and feed off of our confidence.<br/>

After attending the conference, how do your boys feel about unschooling?  How do you feel about it?  Are they informed about the freedom and real support unschooling gives each of them.  The conversations our family has had during the car ride home following each conference reflects the strength and conviction my girls have in what we are doing which helps us all in the face of being with traditional school at homers and schooled families once we&#39;ve returned home.<br/>
<br/>
Are you able to continue to be with unschoolers?  And if your boys are not social butterflies - perhaps simply inviting another family to your home (or a neutral location) for an activity of real interest to both groups.<br/>
<br/>
I know several families with introverted homebody boys and they lack no self esteem from the unschooling lifestyle.  They are fully supported and trusted to know for themselves what is comfortable and right at any given time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1480055167">Hi Janice, I don&#39;t post on here much, mostly just lurk, but I&#39;ve got <br/>
some shy ones in my family too. I have 3 boys ages almost 14, 16 and <br/>
18. My 18 year old has always been shy but has a strong desire to <br/>
figure out how to be social. My 16 yo has never been shy but isn&#39;t a <br/>
super duper outgoing type either. My youngest has always been shy <br/>
and has NO desire to get to know anyone else unless of course they <br/>
come to him and are interested in things he is interested in, like <br/>
online games. I used to worry about my boys because they never <br/>
seemed to want to go out in our neighborhood to find friends to hang <br/>
out with. I finally realized that they had always had each other to <br/>
play with and even though they sometimes get tired of each other and <br/>
act like they would rather be around anyone else in the world than <br/>
their brothers, they really were just best friends. Another thing <br/>
about them that I realized is that they don&#39;t necessarily NEED to be <br/>
around a LOT of other kids. They are perfectly happy to have someone <br/>
they enjoy being with over on occasion.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest one decided to go to high school because he felt like he <br/>
wanted to be around more kids his age. He did make a few friends <br/>
that he has hung out with on occasion but what he has enjoyed the <br/>
most was going to work this last year at a web design company where <br/>
all of the people he works with are WAY older than he is, but he has <br/>
something in common with them, computers!<br/>
<br/>
I always considered myself shy as a child and don&#39;t consider myself <br/>
particularly outgoing now but I have a LOT of friends. Not friends <br/>
that I see all the time but when we see each other it is SO great to <br/>
be with them!<br/>
<br/>
So, I guess my point is, sometimes we worry about our kids more than <br/>
we need to. Maybe you kids don&#39;t need to have more socialization. If <br/>
they are asking for time around other kids, invite someone over. <br/>
Find a way to help that child socialize whether it benefits all 4 of <br/>
them or just the one. He may be the only one that needs it right <br/>
now. I also discovered that over the years they didn&#39;t each have a <br/>
friend their age that they could invite over so we just invited a <br/>
friend or two no matter what age they were and they just all hung <br/>
out together. That&#39;s one of the beauties of unschooling. Age doesn&#39;t <br/>
matter if they have similar interests! But, if they aren&#39;t asking <br/>
for socialization, then maybe they have enough at home!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-383928077">This is an important opportunity here to realize that your children are just <br/>
going to be interested in different, maybe more cerebral activities.<br/>
<br/>
I can tell you from personal experience that it doesn&#39;t make a shy child any <br/>
less shy to be pushed into activities and social situations. I used to be a <br/>
very social, chatty child until I started school. Once school came along and <br/>
chastized me for being chatty and social during class, I squashed that <br/>
behavior. My mother, who had agoraphobia and was extremely, painfully shy <br/>
with just about everyone outside of our family, felt that she would be <br/>
saving me from a world of hurt and awkwardness if she could just bring out <br/>
that social child again. However, if she had only known about unschooling <br/>
(or homeschooling, at least), it might have worked. Instead, she enrolled me <br/>
in dance classes, signed me up for the girlscouts and sent me off to summer <br/>
camps whenever she could afford it.<br/>
<br/>
The end result was I hated these activities and I hated her very often for <br/>
pushing me into these things. Of course, whenever I called her on this and <br/>
told her how much I didn&#39;t want to do all these activities, she would <br/>
explain her reasoning behind it. Didn&#39;t matter. I still hated it.<br/>
<br/>
Result today? I still hate social activities. I could stay home every single <br/>
day and sit and read or get on the computer or garden, etc. and never see <br/>
another person besides my husband and son all day and be super duper happy <br/>
about it. My son, however, is a butterfly who wants to go places and see <br/>
kids, etc., so I pull it out of myself to go somewhere once a day. My <br/>
husband is also a very social person and has to have people over for dinner <br/>
or small parties fairly frequently, so I pull it out of myself for him, too. <br/>
We do have lots of &quot;down time&quot;, though, too, for MY sanity. We have a good <br/>
balance now and it makes everyone happy.<br/>

vocal and well-spoken from a very young age.  I enjoyed being engaged with<br/>
other people.  HOWEVER, what she failed to notice is that I was horribly<br/>
shy!  I hate meeting new people.  I like surrounding myself with a<br/>
comfortable group of people.  When in large crowds, even of people I know, I<br/>
tend to step back out of the center and watch from the sidelines.  It<br/>
surprises people when they find out about this.  &quot;But you are a theatre<br/>
major and studied classical vocal music.  How can you be shy?&quot;  &quot;You are<br/>
always chatty and social.  You aren&#39;t shy.&quot;  But I&#39;m chatty and social<br/>
within small groups among people I am familiar with.  My mother also forced<br/>
me into many different ventures (including ballet and Girl  Scouts) and I<br/>
loathed going to everything but ballet (because it was at a small studio<br/>
with one teacher and the same 8-10 kids year after year.)<br/>
<br/>
And for the record some of the shiest people happen to be my favorite<br/>
singers and actors.  Meryl Streep, Johnny Depp, Barbra Streisand, Jody<br/>
Foster, and Liam Neeson.<br/>
