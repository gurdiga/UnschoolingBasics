<div id="ygrps-yiv-992994374">&quot;&gt;  Scary images don&#39;t get better by knowing how they were generated.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
For a LOT of people it can!! I&#39;m a makeup artist. The industry mags<br/>
that show bloody, gory effects do not bother me. I&#39;m fascinated by the<br/>
artistry behind it and how to create the effect.:)<br/>
<br/>
Most folks see gore, I see latex and airbrushing and ????<br/>
So for me, it has a HUGE effect on images not being as scary.<br/>
<br/>
For my children also. As they watch more and more of the &quot;behind the<br/>
scenes&quot; stuff, the less anything scares them very deeply. It all<br/>
depends of course.<br/>
