&gt; I&#39;m sure this has posted numerous time, but please pardon my request....<br/>
&gt; :)<br/>
&gt; For a newbie who is pursing the world of unschooling and such, but am<br/>
&gt; nervous about record keeping, any links on samples or simplified ones?<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m in Missouri, and it really isn&#39;t that complicated to do it, but seeing<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; basic idea on keeping up on the 1000 hours on a log would be great.......<br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>
