<div id="ygrps-yiv-759697123">I want to thank all the people who commented on my post about Transformers, comics, <br/>
superheros, movies and video games.  I said I would post photos when we had them of my <br/>
son&#39;s costume.  Here are the pre-painting photos of the costume he created so far.  Thanks.<br/>
