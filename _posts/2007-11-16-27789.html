<div id="ygrps-yiv-1812715427">I got a very challenging email from a woman I met at the bus  <br/>
yesterday.  She responded do my web content of this:<br/>
<br/>
regain inner trust to learn through their own exploration.  Too  <br/>
often, we tell kids when to learn, what to learn, and how to learn  <br/>
it.  Our goal is to offer exercises and tools that they can use to  <br/>
access their own creative process and inner knowing.<br/>
<br/>
(I offer yoga for all ages)<br/>
<br/>
with this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How is it that children can learn to do the above without teaching  <br/>
and learning from parents, adults, and their peers?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I cringed.  And, it made me really sad that people see children as  <br/>
something we need to teach into something appropriate.  Shouldn&#39;t  <br/>
they be good enough as they are?<br/>
As I craft my response email, I&#39;m looking for any great John Taylor  <br/>
Gatto quotes, or anything that I might send back to her.<br/>
The email got worse.  She accused me of teaching controversial  <br/>
spirituality and said, &quot;I assumed you actually wanted to help  <br/>
children and youth.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Trying to just find good quotes about trusting children and  <br/>
progressive education.  If you are sitting on any, email me!  I could  <br/>
really use the support.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;There is, of course, this matter of being afraid to give freedom to<br/>
young children. I believe they have that within themselves which<br/>
makes it possible for them to meet the world and life and interpret it<br/>
more nearly aright than can we. They carry with them that inheritance of<br/>
faith and imagination undimmed; and that tremendous surging desire to<br/>
know, to see, to feel and to do, which is rarely betrayed. In our<br/>
desire as adults to lay hold of a child&#39;s life, to grip it, mold it<br/>
to our own values, we do unwittingly a great harm. We confront children<br/>
with our own fears, our own lack of faith; to safeguard them we<br/>
attempt to thrust between them and life those many false illusions<br/>
which we have picked up in our own twisting, turning way. Children<br/>
take a far more advantageous highroad. A free child is a happy child;<br/>
and there is nothing more lovely �<br/>
&quot; � Ruth Sawyer, in her acceptance speech upon winning the Newbery<br/>
Award for Roller Skates, 1936<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-415852110">I like these two quotes that aren&#39;t from the homeschool gurus but <br/>
names people in the general population would recognize and possibly <br/>
admire:<br/>
<br/>
IT IS, IN FACT, NOTHING short of a miracle that the modern methods <br/>
of education have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of <br/>
inquiry; for this delicate little plant, aside from stimulation, <br/>
stands mainly in need of freedom; without this it goes to wrack and <br/>
ruin without fail. It is a very grave mistake to think that the <br/>
enjoyment of seeing and searching can be promoted by means of <br/>
coercion and a sense of duty. To the contrary, I believe that it <br/>
would be possible to rob even a healthy beast of prey of its <br/>
voraciousness, if it were possible, with the aid of a whip, to force <br/>
the beast to devour continuously, even when not hungry, especially <br/>
if the food, handed out under such coercion, were to be selected <br/>
accordingly. <br/>
--Albert Einstein<br/>
<br/>
You cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him to find it <br/>
within himself <br/>

<br/>
I am sitting on more quotes if you&#39;d like more.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-423041416">Hi Jeanne,<br/>
<br/>
firstly i must say you have a lot of energy to engage with the woman  <br/>
you described. Im not sure if i would be motivated to do likewise...  <br/>
but you asked:<br/>

<br/>
Since we can�t know what knowledge will be most needed in the future,  <br/>
it is senseless to try to teach it in advance. Instead, we should try  <br/>
to turn out people who love learning so much and learn so well that  <br/>
they will be able to learn whatever needs to be learned<br/>

� John Holt<br/>

What we want to see is the child in pursuit of knowledge, not  <br/>
knowledge in pursuit of the child.<br/>
<br/>
� George Bernard Shaw<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just as eating against one�s will is injurious to health, so study  <br/>
without a liking for it spoils the memory, and it retains nothing it  <br/>
takes in.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s hard enough to deal with spouses and extended family members and <br/>
close friends/neighbors that don&#39;t get it.<br/>
<br/>
But worrying about a total stranger from the bus or internet is just a <br/>
waste of time! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why do you feel she&#39;s worth responding to?<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t really need to answer---I just figure you might have better <br/>
things to attend to! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Most folks really don&#39;t want to know---they just like to argue.<br/>
