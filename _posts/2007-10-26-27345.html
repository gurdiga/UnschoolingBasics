<div id="ygrps-yiv-1611886650">It has helped to read lots of posts about watching tv and playing <br/>
electronic and computer games with your kids. They helped create more <br/>

I wonder if there are readers lurking on this list who do not have much <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1939888703">Hi,<br/>
 <br/>
My kids are 4 and almost 7. We don&#39;t watch much T.V except for an  occasional <br/>
video. It is just carried over from when my oldest was in school. I  had a <br/>
rule about no T.V during the week and it has stuck since. They play(and  fight) <br/>
a lot together and we hang out in the backyard pretty much. They just  like to <br/>
play more than anything right now. Not showing much interest in the  pc yet, <br/>
but I&#39;m sure that day will come:)<br/>
 <br/>
                                                                      Cheers  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-259555574">We don&#39;t have much screen time. We don&#39;t have cable so there&#39;s not too <br/>
much on that intrests the kids. I don&#39;t watch much either, usually <br/>
just the news. Occassionaly we watch a video together. We do have a <br/>
playstation, but they really don&#39;t seem too intrested in that either, <br/>
which is fine by me. We have a gameboy, at first they wanted to play <br/>
it alot, now they have pretty much forgotten about it. My 10yods has <br/>
just started to ask to play the computer. I let him occassionaly, <br/>
maybe a few times a week. We play alot of games: board games, cards <br/>
and puzzles. We also spend a few hours a day outside everyday.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1168129656">We&#39;re not exactly a non-screen family, but we do have limits. If the  <br/>
computer is used, I limit the time to about an hour or so. For the TV, I am much  <br/>
more lenient. On certain days, the TV is on most of the day. On others, I just  ke<br/>
ep it off. We don&#39;t have any video game systems in our house. <br/>
 <br/>
Some would say that I don&#39;t follow the unschooling philosophy, but I try to  <br/>
protect my kids from the addictive nature of video games. If they started  <br/>
showing signs of TV addiction, I would do the same thing. There are times when I  <br/>
need to consciously avoid the TV and computer because I feel addicted to <br/>
them.  I&#39;m not saying that others need to conform to my ideas, but this is how I <br/>
feel  about them.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-580654457">Our kids are 6 and 3. We don&#39;t own a TV. Neither dh or I ever have (and <br/>
we&#39;re in our mid-40s). We both had TVs in our family homes growing up <br/>
with no restrictions. There are just so many other things I&#39;d rather be <br/>
doing. Once the kids become aware of TV and start asking for one, we&#39;ll <br/>
get one. None of their closest playmates have TVs so my kids have only <br/>
seen them in stores and at a couple of relatives who live in other <br/>
parts of the country. Once when their Grandma&#39;s TV was on, my oldest <br/>
kept saying to his cousins, &quot;Come on let&#39;s play.&quot; until one of them <br/>
did. So far, they haven&#39;t seemed to want one but I know that will <br/>
change. When we do get one I won&#39;t restrict them in their viewing.<br/>

<br/>
Rules stink that way. People quit questioning how much sense they make<br/>
and just blindly follow them. Kids won&#39;t do that for always though.<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s time to re-think the arbitrary nature of forbidding anyone<br/>
from something.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling tends to unfold best in an atmosphere of trust. If a<br/>
parent is controlling choices, there tends to be less trust.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Which is saying the rest of us are not protecting our kids from  <br/>
addiction.<br/>
<br/>
If that is so, then why would you listen to a word we say? We&#39;re  <br/>
dangerous. We care more about adhering to a philosophy than we do  <br/>
about our kids.<br/>
<br/>
If something about that sounds off, then the other possibility is  <br/>
that we care just as much as you do but we know -- not just believe!  <br/>
-- that video games and TV are not addictive.<br/>
<br/>
There are families with kids here who had restrictions and the  <br/>
parents were convinced their kids were addicted. They found that by  <br/>
removing the restrictions, after some time, the supposed addiction  <br/>
was cured.<br/>
<br/>
(Though kids often do go through a period of glut after restrictions  <br/>
are removed. It&#39;s also typical for preteens to increase their TV  <br/>
viewing. And some kids do watch more than their parents feel is  <br/>
&quot;necessary&quot; (but their parents need to get over that!))<br/>
<br/>
Giving an alcoholic or drug addict free access to the drug of their  <br/>
choice would not cure them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If they started<br/>
&gt; showing signs of TV addiction, I would do the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>TV addiction is a myth.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a lot to read here:<br/>

<br/>

&gt; addicted to<br/>
&gt; them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I too felt addicted to email for years. Now, not so much.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t addiction. It was a need for connection and a need to have  <br/>
alone time (I&#39;m a huge introvert) that wasn&#39;t being fulfilled. Now  <br/>
that my daughter is older and I have time for myself I don&#39;t need it  <br/>
as much and can actually just check once in the morning now.<br/>
<br/>
People use TV and the internet (and sex and food and book collecting  <br/>
and so on) to meet unmet needs. The actions can look like addiction,  <br/>
but the motivations are completely different. Sometimes the solutions  <br/>
are soothing but don&#39;t fix the problem so they do more to the point  <br/>
where the solution is a problem.<br/>
<br/>
(Unread books falling off my shelves? Where?)<br/>
<br/>
It helps people think more clearly about solutions when they see the  <br/>
problems clearly. Confusing a need with an addiction doesn&#39;t help  <br/>
people think clearly about a problem.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m not saying that others need to conform to my ideas, but this is  <br/>
&gt; how I<br/>
&gt; feel about them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The huge difference is we&#39;re not going by our feelings. We&#39;re acting  <br/>
on deep thought, discussion and knowledge, holding these problems up  <br/>
to the light of day and truly examining them despite our fears,  <br/>
despite our need to knee jerk react to those fears to protect our  <br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
We all care about our children as much as you do. We don&#39;t want &quot;TV  <br/>
addicts&quot; any more than you do. We aren&#39;t just crossing our fingers  <br/>
and hoping they don&#39;t get addicted just because we want to give them  <br/>
freedom. We know from personal experience that kids who are living  <br/>
full lives, with TV and internet and video games a part of that,  <br/>
don&#39;t become &quot;addicted&quot;. TV and so on is just another activity to do  <br/>
or not do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1782851337">I use the TV and the computer as a means for my son to learn.  My son loves to watch PBS sprout.  Although, the TV maybe on 24/7 pratically, my son doesn&#39;t watch TV most of the time.  But he&#39;s found ways to play, watch TV, learn, and other activities at his own pace and time.  I let him decide when and what to do.  Only structure we have is meals and sleeping schedules and even those have been known to change slightly from time to time.  My son loves to learn.  He&#39;s not even 4 yrs old yet, and he knows quite a bit more than the average child.  We are currently in the process of learning to read.  He knows his letters, knows some short words and his name.  He&#39;s even has done a type of exercise program to the TV.  He loves the care bears and one of his care bear videos has an exercise video.  Not all may agree with allowing him the freedom he has, altho, he can be quite busy most of the time.  Just curious, how does one deal with trying to homeschool and babysitting most of the day?  I feel we haven&#39;t done much the last couple weeks, since I started to babysit another little boy that&#39;s my son&#39;s age.  Most of the time it feels like they are playing and and even fighting.  I&#39;ve lost count on them hitting and bitting.  Which seems to be something that&#39;s getting better, but I still deal with it everyday (M-F).  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1234751128">Instead of putting our focus on whether or not the kids are watching  <br/>
too much, we can put our focus on supporting their interests and  <br/>
offering them lots and lots of possible experiences. If their  <br/>
interests include tv-watching, then far from restricting them,  <br/>
instead, I supported that interest. I did that by enthusiastically  <br/>
watching with them, playing tv-show based games online or as  <br/>
videogames, getting tv-based hands-on games and toys and puzzles,  <br/>
noticing when there might be a &quot;special&quot; on tv they&#39;d want to watch,  <br/>
noticing which shows they really liked and finding all kinds of tie- <br/>
ins (use Google to look for all kinds of things related to their  <br/>
favorite tv shows), bring up things happening in their favorite shows  <br/>
when you&#39;re having conversations about other things, dress up like  <br/>
the tv show characters for Halloween or just for fun anytime, get  <br/>
books and coloring books and activity books that are related, BUYING  <br/>
whole seasons of their favorite shows, getting cd&#39;s of the music from  <br/>
their shows, getting books based on the shows or on which the shows  <br/>
are based, AND finding creative ways of extending some of the  <br/>
inevitable connections that every show brings up.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe sometimes people really just can&#39;t imagine how to respond to tv  <br/>
in a way more consistent with showing the deep underlying trust in  <br/>
our children on which unschooling is based.<br/>
<br/>
For those restricting tv, maybe just try this as an experiment. Next  <br/>
time you have the urge to make them turn it off, instead, look for a  <br/>
way to support their interest and enrich their lives. A simple and  <br/>
obvious way is to go cuddle up with them and enjoy watching together.  <br/>
Ask questions, get involved. Maybe join them with a cup of cocoa and  <br/>
some cookies. Or get online and look for connections to offer. Choose  <br/>
your time - don&#39;t interrupt, but in between shows you can say, &quot;Oh,  <br/>
look, I found these Sponge Bob coloring pages for you and I brought  <br/>
you some crayons, if you&#39;re interested.&quot; And, talk about the show,  <br/>
&quot;Did you know that the guy who made up SpongeBob is a real marine  <br/>
biologist?&quot; Or, &quot;I wonder why he didn&#39;t make SpongeBob look more like  <br/>
a real sea sponge? I mean, he looks like a kitchen sponge.&quot; (You can  <br/>
buy a piece of sea sponge at a craft store or in paint dept of Home  <br/>
Depot - get some and have fun sponge painting with it.)<br/>
<br/>
Decide to take that moment to SHOW you honor and support their  <br/>
choices. I wish I could get across to parents of younger children how  <br/>
VERY wonderful it will be for you when your kids are teens if you  <br/>
have created that atmosphere of real trust. Don&#39;t you want to end up  <br/>
with teens who live up to that confidence you&#39;ve shown in them? You  <br/>
undermine it every time you show your lack of trust - every time you  <br/>
arbitrarily restrict tv you are telling them, &quot;I don&#39;t trust you to  <br/>
know what&#39;s good for you.&quot; Instead, start from the beginning saying,  <br/>
&quot;I trust your choices and will support them.&quot; This is not trivial;  <br/>
this is building the relationship you will have in a few years and  <br/>
during a time of life when most parents lose that closeness and  <br/>
honesty and confidence in their own teens. If you restrict tv now,  <br/>
will you try to restrict them from the things they want when they are  <br/>
teens, too? It won&#39;t work and everyone knows it, but parents don&#39;t  <br/>
know what else to do. They act like they can control their teenagers,  <br/>
but that is so obviously not true, teens whose parents are  <br/>
restrictive will often put themselves in much more risky situations  <br/>
than otherwise. Start trusting them now if that is the relationship  <br/>
you hope to have when they are teens. You can&#39;t just manufacture it  <br/>
later, it is built on years of showing trust and confidence and  <br/>
support of their interests.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-969123941">I haven&#39;t read all the responses, just a quick scan, and noticed a<br/>
number of people responding who have younger kids.<br/>
<br/>
Our family has changed screen time over time.  What is appropriate for<br/>
a teen is not necessarily right for a 2 yr old.  (Just like quantity<br/>
of food -- if you have a teenaged boy, you know that they eat a LOT<br/>
more food than any toddler.<br/>
<br/>
When ds was very young, and all the neighbors were plopping their kids<br/>
in front of Sesame Street and Barney, I was playing with my ds.  We<br/>
turned S.S. on once, for about 2-3 minutes.  They started out with a<br/>
nice, gentle segment showing African animals -- got his attention. <br/>
But all too soon, they went to baby-MTV mode, flashing this and that<br/>
so fast.  I think it is well designed to shorten attention spans, not<br/>
what I wanted for ds.  Besides, he didn&#39;t like the flashy bit -- he<br/>
was a study-and-absorb kind of tot.  He walked away, I turned off the<br/>
tube, and we never tried Sesame Street again.<br/>
<br/>
When he was about 2, in February, he came down with a cold, and was<br/>
listless, and asked to watch the Grinch.  So, in February, we watched<br/>
How the Grinch Stole Christmas several times.  <br/>
<br/>
We taped the Shining Time Station stuff and edited out the idiocy, and<br/>
just watched the Thomas the Tank Engine stuff -- he was a Thomas fan,<br/>
we had all the books, etc.  Again, this wasn&#39;t a huge part of his<br/>
life.  And -- we watched together.  I don&#39;t recall ever using the tv<br/>
as an electronic babysitter.<br/>
<br/>
But much of what dh and I watched was, at the time, too intense for<br/>
our sensitive guy.  So we time-shifted with the vcr, and watched while<br/>
ds slept.<br/>
<br/>
As he got older, though, there were things we were eager to share with<br/>
him, such as Star Trek.  (That was a lot later, btw, because, well, he<br/>
was so sensitive, and freaked at it at a much later age than many kids<br/>
these days.)  <br/>
<br/>
Now we watch a fair amount, but still as a family.  We find it<br/>
enjoyable together time, and often discuss the shows.  (Generally,<br/>
they are taped ahead of time, so we can skip commercials.)<br/>
<br/>
The other screen -- the computer -- we didn&#39;t officially limit, but it<br/>
was fairly self-limiting when he was young.  We didn&#39;t use a lot of<br/>
kiddie software, so it held little attraction.  DS was active, and had<br/>
lots to occupy himself without the screen.<br/>
<br/>
As he got older, I occasionally imposed a computer restriction when I<br/>
saw it adversely affecting his behavior.  The usual reaction was, &quot;I&#39;m<br/>
bored...&quot;  then -- a burst of creativity in many diverse areas.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve never had official time limits on hours/day or whatever.  Now,<br/>
ds wants to be a programmer, preferably game programmer.  Obviously,<br/>
he needs the &#39;puter to make his games.  The ONLY restriction we have<br/>
is on Runescape.  And the way we set it up is we essentially gave him<br/>
a time budget -- so many hours/month, so many per year.  He has a log<br/>
sheet to help keep track.  He agreed that it was fair (and we had a<br/>
pretty generous &quot;income&quot; of time for him.)  Since we instituted the<br/>
budget system, things got back into balance.  We didn&#39;t want to cut<br/>
him off cold turkey -- forbidden fruit always tastes so sweet.  But it<br/>
was making him off-balanced, and I think, if you asked him, he might<br/>
agree.  (He currently is away at a scout volunteer activity, so I<br/>
can&#39;t ask him now.)  Does he play a fair amount of Runescape still --<br/>
yup.  But he spends as much or more time on the &#39;puter working on his<br/>
games - graphics, scripting, that sort of thing.  (And, as an added<br/>
benefit, his knowledge of graphics is much better than mine, and he<br/>
was able to help me figure out a solution to importing pdf files into<br/>
Publisher for my newsletter.  I love it when kids see the real value<br/>
to their efforts.)<br/>
<br/>
I suspect you weren&#39;t looking for this level of detailed response!  Be<br/>
careful what you ask for.... ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-482946863">Well said Tina. <br/>
   <br/>
  &quot;Anytime we went anywhere that had television my husband and children became instant tv zombies. We now have a PS2 and cable. Now that the tv is not a scarce resource, my zombies are coming back to life. We go days without turning on the television just <br/>

   <br/>
  I can totally understand how some parents still cannot see tv as a learning tool, but rather tv is seen more like as a form of entertainment instead. Yes, I supposed being addicted to entertainment can be bad, especially when you&#39;re too busy having fun, not learning all those necessary survival skills of readng writing or maths or cooking or exercising our body. But I would like to say, have a think about this. When they grow up, will they get stuck in front of a tv, when they are at a friends place, when they are 15 or 16 yrs old, when you are no longer to monitor/ control them? <br/>
   <br/>
  My answer is always &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;. Therefore, no reason to control/ monitor  him now, as I want to be sure that all the decisions that my son makes, from now onwards, is his own. I do not want surprises when he&#39;s 15, where he&#39;s might do a total &quot;flip&quot;, just like all my friends teenage kids&#39; done. Why the surprise? That&#39;s because when they are teen, they all of a sudden realised they have a choice, the choice to listen to mum/ dad, or the choice to follow thier heart. Naturally the heart  always wins. Which explains the moans of &quot;they are not doing what they always do;  this is so unlike them;  I don&#39;t know why he has changed&quot; &quot;they won&#39;t listen!&quot; . That&#39;s because &quot;what they always do&quot;, is not thier choice but merely the adults (parents, relatives, society). <br/>
   <br/>
  So what are you going to do then, when they suddenly wouldn&#39;t bulge from the tv and they are too big for you to sent to thier room? <br/>
   <br/>
  Sometimes, it&#39;s worth considering the option to just &quot;let go&quot; and surrender to it? Then the  &quot;fear of addiction for electronic media being bad for our children&quot; will simply melt away. It can be a very scary, giving in to something that is so very alien, so bad. But you have to look forward, and think of the scenario/ environment your children will be living in. Electronic is becoming more and more involved in our life. Even Sony PSP is being introduced as a value-enhancing educating tool in school. In Maths, learning about the calculator is a legit topic on it&#39;s own! I bet when it first came out, it was considered evil too.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I know some of us might argue that a calculator screen cannot be compared to a tv screen. Why not? Well for one, it doeans&#39;t entertain. And it hasn&#39;t got a big screen, spewing out all those zombifying coloured pixels. <br/>
   <br/>
  Ah....nevertheless, coloured screen or not, the calculator is still after all &quot;a medium of easy access to information&quot; without our brain having to work hard. A short cut that only required our eyes and fingers. And it doesn&#39;t requires the conversation (but yet it can ceate conversations/ discussions opportunities, just like the tv) With a calculator, we learnt of the maths answer without having to stretch our brains, just the same as the tv, an easy source of information with having to rake thru an encyclopedia. <br/>
   <br/>
  Isn&#39;t this bad for the brain? It&#39;ll just zombiefied them? Not at all, on contrary, I believe my son&#39;s brain is working even faster when he&#39;s watching any screen, because his brain is busy absorbing, making sense, cross referencing info and storing for later use. This is evident because very often, discussions can be strike-up about a certain scenario we watched on the tv, liinking it to another similar life situation.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I just think any electronic media be it tv or pc or calculator allows faster learning, leaving my child more time to do other things. In a way, it&#39;s like &quot;better time management&quot;. Having to utilised the minimal time resources for maximum gain of knowledge, leaves him more time to concentrate on harder things that cannot be achieved via the tv or pc. Like jumping on the trampoline, gardening, running around like a mad cave man, painting, or playing with toys, which will eventually happen, when his brain had enough and would like to take &quot;a break from learning&quot;.      <br/>

We&#39;re not exactly a non-screen family, but we do have limits. If the  <br/>
computer is used, I limit the time to about an hour or so. For the <br/>
TV, I am much more lenient. On certain days, the TV is on most of the <br/>
day. On others, I just  keep it off. We don&#39;t have any video game <br/>
systems in our house.&gt; Some would say that I don&#39;t follow the <br/>
unschooling philosophy, but I try to protect my kids from the <br/>
addictive nature of video games. If they started showing signs of TV <br/>
addiction, I would do the same thing. There are times when I need to <br/>
consciously avoid the TV and computer because I feel addicted to <br/>
them.  I&#39;m not saying that others need to conform to my ideas, but <br/>
this is how I feel  about them.  <br/>
<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m writing this in defence of sharilynn29. <br/>
<br/>
I was really upset by 2 particular reply, which I felt was a little <br/>
bit harsh and vey critical of sharilynn29&#39;s belief, <br/>
And it&#39;s not only this post. Like many post before, I&#39;ve noticed <br/>
parents with good intentions posting thier advice and opinion, gets <br/>
critisized for non &quot;unschooling&quot; praticises.  <br/>
<br/>
The origin of this topic, I assumed was someone asking for support <br/>
from other unschooling non-screen families, and perhaps wanting a <br/>
better insight of these families work around thier tv issues and a <br/>
little bit of support. And many did reply, offering scenarios of <br/>
thier approach to tv, some are very suportive of tv, some not so, <br/>
which was great, because now the person have a wide choice of options <br/>
to mull about. For those of us who is supportive of tv, I suppose we <br/>
would all love to &quot;share&quot; our joy in finding the freedom and benefit <br/>
of tv watching. And for a non-screen parent to offer some insights of <br/>
how thier &quot;limited screen time&quot; work in thier lives, it is offered in <br/>
good faith.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair for anyone to start critising <br/>
them, for what they believe. I&#39;ve re-read the post many times, and in <br/>
no way did sharilynn29 above said or implied we &quot;tv believing&quot; <br/>
parents is wrong and failing our children. She believes in what she <br/>
constitudes to be addictive behaviour in her children, and is doing <br/>
what she believes is best for her children. But that doeasn&#39;t mean <br/>
she felt we &quot;tv believing parents&quot; was irreponsible to allow our <br/>
children to be tv- addict zombie. I don&#39;t think anybody should take <br/>
it as a personal insult! She was merely stating what she believes is <br/>
working for them. (How and why, we won&#39;t know because we are not part <br/>
of her family). And that to her the tv can invoke the addicitive <br/>
element, in her and her children and she&#39;s found a way to balance <br/>
that.  And this is possible. I have known of some children or adults <br/>
who&#39;s just not interested in tvs or pc at all, what luck for the <br/>
parents!! <br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m trying to say is, if we can accord such courtesy and respect <br/>
to our unschooling children, that we do allow them to make mistakes <br/>
and not critisized them for it. Why can we do the same for other <br/>
parents? And that we all believed we shouldn&#39;t impose our opinions, <br/>
likes and dislikes onto our children, why then are some of us, <br/>
stating so strong of our disagreement of another parents point of <br/>
view? And that to disecting, analysing and critisizing thier words/ <br/>
actions of not being able to relinquish full control and trust to <br/>
thier child? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Description of the frnt page of Unschoolingbasics. <br/>
 &quot;A list designed for those new to the philosophy of unschooling. Ask <br/>
experienced unschoolers all those niggling questions, and find out <br/>
how unschooling works in real families.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re familiar with John Holt&#39;s work, but unsure of how to begin <br/>
or what an unschooling day really looks like, this is a place for you <br/>
to discuss,question, ponder and become deeply familiar with natural <br/>
learning and how it affects our entire lives. From parenting issues <br/>
to learning from the whole wide world and beyond, come explore the <br/>
issues that unschooling families have dealt with in the past and how <br/>
to get beyond &quot;school-think&quot; to a joyful unschooling lifestyle&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Nowhere did it say, if you&#39;re not 100% unschooling, you&#39;re not <br/>
welcome. Nowhere did it say, if you&#39;re still unsure about going 100% <br/>
unschooling, your non-unschooling ideas that worked for you, might <br/>
get critised. Is it right that I should worry about sharing some of <br/>
my experience or post my ignorant non -unschooling opinions, and face <br/>
the possibility of being critized? I do get very upset if I&#39;m <br/>
critised because it&#39;s basically telling me I&#39;m not good enough. Or <br/>
that my ideas are rubbish. I get very upset seeng other parents being <br/>
critised because I see it as bullying, and not the &quot;constructive <br/>
critism&quot; as one might try to defend it.   <br/>
<br/>
It makes me question how much freedom am I allowed to share my <br/>
problems, experience and beliefs on this list, without getting a <br/>
sharp reprove?  What works for my family, might not work for another, <br/>
but then maybe, just maybe, my answer might be able to provide some <br/>
better alternative ideas, some comfort or perhaps support.    <br/>
<br/>
Does this means if I&#39;m not ready to release full control to my son <br/>
with regards to tv or anything for that matter, does that invalidate <br/>
all these unschooling living that we&#39;ve been doing for the past 11 <br/>
months? <br/>
<br/>
I believe it is thru all our differences replies, with our many <br/>
different views and different comfort level of unschooling, with our <br/>
many different ways of releasing trust to our children, is what <br/>
allows us all to learnt more, off each other. And it is possible some <br/>
families have unschool so well that they do not feel they have <br/>
anything more to learnt off others. But yet, it is thru all these <br/>
dfferent stories of unschooling, some of you a &quot;successful&quot; 110%, <br/>
some a &quot;almost there&quot; 70%, some &quot;a confident and picking up speed&quot; <br/>
50% and some maybe just &quot;a slow and still uncertain&quot; 30%, that help <br/>
many of us to push forth.  <br/>
<br/>
The last thing we need when appealing to this list for comfort and <br/>
support, or  share &quot;well meaning&quot; non-schooling ways of doing things, <br/>
to help further ease the burden and scary journey into &quot;letting go of <br/>
central command&quot;, is being told we&#39;re not unschooling enough, or that <br/>
we&#39;re failing our children because of not being able to release full <br/>
control to him! What a slap to the face and confidence! <br/>
 <br/>
The fact that some of us is accessing this list, is proving enough <br/>
that we all want to unschool successfully, and is trying our bestest <br/>
to improve and  undo all our bad parenting habit, by constantly try <br/>
to find ways that doesn&#39;t spook us. <br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s only fair that everyone is allowed to post and received <br/>
any message, no matter how silly/ non-unschooling it is, without any <br/>
prejudice. And that we are allowed the full freedom and the trust <br/>
that we will know what&#39;s best for our children and will eventually <br/>
learn to let go, slow but surely. <br/>
<br/>
I am currently helping a friend (a very traditional, no tv, no <br/>
gamebox person) and her 9 yr old to unschool. And I very frequently <br/>
tells her it&#39;s ok and it&#39;s not the end of the world if she&#39;s chickens <br/>
out of relinquishing certain control back to her very active son, who <br/>
happens to be de-schooling big time with lots of gamebox, swearing <br/>
and shouting. And that it&#39;s ok to only give a tiny bit of control to <br/>
the son and not alot, if that&#39;s what&#39;s she&#39;s comfrotable doing, for a <br/>
start. I very often points it out to her, that it&#39;s she who&#39;s having <br/>
a bad time de-schooling/ unschooling, and not her son. That she&#39;s the <br/>
one, who&#39;s scared, and not her son. And that she really wants to <br/>
unschool because she&#39;s convinced it is for better, but yet, she&#39;s <br/>
fnding it very very scary and hard. My words to her is &quot;Don&#39;t be hard <br/>
on yourself. You can&#39;t do everything in one day. When you&#39;re ready, <br/>
you will let go quite willingly, painlessly, and confidently.&quot; Never <br/>
did I once critised her for hanging onto the 1 hour tv limit and the <br/>
1 hour gamebox playing, despite I could see how hard her son was <br/>
rebelling against the limit. It&#39;s not my family nor my life to judge. <br/>
The only thing I could offer her was the constantly insight into our <br/>
life with my son&#39;s fulltime attachement to the online Disney <br/>
community and tv. And of course, to assured her that she&#39;s not a bad <br/>
mum, just because she couldn&#39;t do what I&#39;m doing. Infact, she&#39;s a <br/>
very very good and brave mum, to attempt something that she couldn&#39;t <br/>
even possibly contemplate doing 2 months ago. And that&#39;s to unschool, <br/>
for her son. And that most of we unschoolers all start off <br/>
unschooling, feeling very very worried and very very unsure of <br/>
ourselves, and the only sure thing is that we all know we&#39;re doing <br/>
this for the best of our children. <br/>
<br/>
With Best Regrds to all,<br/>

<br/>
I didn&#39;t start this list to pat people on the back and tell them<br/>
they&#39;re doing just fine if they want to control and manipulate their<br/>
children. This list exists for the purpose of helping people let GO of<br/>
mainstream ideas and ideals.<br/>
<br/>
If someone wants support for controlling their children&#39;s tv viewing,<br/>
it will have to be gotten elsewhere...which should be really EASY<br/>
because everywhere else in society you&#39;ll have support for that. We<br/>
aren&#39;t here to provide support for limits and control. You can find<br/>
that EVERYWHERE. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re here to provide support for a very different kind of parenting.<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean there won&#39;t be people that are struggling with<br/>
various parts of the philosophies. We understand that. Many of us have<br/>
been there ourselves (ask me all about tv controls!!):)<br/>
<br/>
But if we are to say exactly what everyone else in society is saying<br/>
&quot;limit your children. Control their choices. Don&#39;t respect them.&quot; then<br/>
what good is this list for people that WANT a different way of<br/>
relating to their children??? It would be incredibly disrespectful to<br/>
all these folks that signed on here looking for a very NEW way to<br/>
parent and relate to their children if we just pat everyone on the<br/>
back and say &quot;everything you&#39;re doing is just fine&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
That isn&#39;t what most people are here for. I&#39;m certainly not.<br/>
All you have to do is talk to every person in the neighborhood to get<br/>
approval for limits!! That&#39;s really easy to find in this world. It&#39;s<br/>
not so easy to find other people that will help us move AWAY from the<br/>
control paradigm. It&#39;s not so easy to find people that will point out<br/>
ways to be MORE respectful to children and their choices.<br/>
<br/>
This list has existed for over three years and has almost 1700<br/>
members. No two people here do things exactly alike. Everyone is at a<br/>
very different place in their own journey. Nobody expects anyone to be<br/>
anywhere other than where they ARE right now. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really thankful for this place where mainstream ideas are<br/>
challenged, where we can all talk about ways to respect children MORE,<br/>
not less. I&#39;m thankful this list stays true to it&#39;s purpose which is<br/>
helping people understand the environment unschooling will blossom in<br/>
best. I&#39;m thankful for the many voices that contribute, question and<br/>
especially for those that (year after year after year) answer<br/>
questions and help people see there are better options than control<br/>
and limits.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know that I would ever have fully understood the idea of<br/>
partnering with my children had nobody come along and challenged me to<br/>
stretch and grow. We NEED alternatives to limits if we are to change<br/>
how we interact with our children.<br/>
<br/>
If people want simple support for whatever they are doing, whether it<br/>
helps unschooling or not, this isn&#39;t the place. We&#39;re here to discuss,<br/>
ponder, analyze and offer options. I believe this has been done with<br/>
kindness and respect. Everyone is free to take what they choose from<br/>
any discussion, just like any autodidact would from any resource. <br/>
<br/>
This list is one of many, many, many resources. A great one I believe,<br/>
but only one. <br/>

<br/>
Very nicely stated, Ren. (My opinion.)<br/>
<br/>
We deal with the &#39;limit setting&#39; in-laws all the time and from the differences<br/>
I can see between the three male cousins all within a year of each other<br/>
by age, only the boys with limits suffer the &#39;zombie effect&#39; of TV.  It better<br/>
be interesting to intrigue my son and then it better be at a time he wants<br/>
to watch it as he knows how to use the DVR and he&#39;ll use it.<br/>
<br/>
I, personally, find great value in unlimited screen time.  When my son has gotten<br/>
caught up in a computer game like Age of Empires or Civilzation, he learns so much!<br/>
Since we have switched to unschooling, his learning has excelled in so many areas.<br/>
He is also retaining what he is learning because he&#39;s enjoying the journey.<br/>
<br/>
I, personally, LOVE this list and this wonderful group of ladies.<br/>
I appreciate all you do in helping us learn to love, trust, and guide our kids to grow<br/>
up in true freedom.  My family also loves you all as you have helped me let go of<br/>
issues that made me scream at them before. (house cleaning, lol, the last frontier.)<br/>

Hi Robbin, <br/>
<br/>
I found the same thing when we first started unschooling (about 3 <br/>
years ago)...reading other people&#39;s experiences, thoughts and ideas <br/>
helped us to get where we are today. I can&#39;t imagine getting here <br/>
without people like Pam S. & Joyce...also Sandra. Reading about how <br/>
they did it gave me ideas on how to incorporate more and more of <br/>
that kind of parenting into my own family. After all, that&#39;s why I <br/>
was there (the message boards at unschooling.com that is - which is <br/>
no longer there by the way).....because I wanted a change for my <br/>
family and in my case, (and I suspect many of you) it had to start <br/>
with me. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I wonder if there are readers lurking on this list who do not <br/>
 </span></blockquote>have much screen time in their homes. What does that look like for <br/>
you?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s probably a good deal of members who don&#39;t have much screen <br/>
time because they don&#39;t own a TV (or fill in your screen-of-choice). <br/>
I know I sometimes take for granted that everybody has a computer <br/>
(or three like us), gaming systems, TV, DVD, VCR, etc. I feel <br/>
fortunate that we have these things because they add to our lives, <br/>
as do many of the things we own and are able to use.  <br/>
<br/>
Then again, there are members who own those things, but they&#39;re <br/>
children really aren&#39;t interested in them. We have Playstation 2 and <br/>
a ton of games and my daughters (( & 12) have gone weeks without <br/>
playing. Right now, a matter of fact, Shawna is sitting next to me <br/>
playing Spyro and trying to get past a level. She&#39;s played more <br/>
today (about 2.5 hours and counting) than she has all month. <br/>
<br/>
Also, as I read in some of the posts, there are some that limit <br/>
their children screen time. I would suggest to those members that <br/>
you read more about the experiences of those who have let go of <br/>
control and rules and replaced it with discussions, involvement, <br/>
trust, modeling, respect, etc. I really think that is the key to <br/>
understanding unschooling. When you remove what used to be there, <br/>
replace it with something else, something different, something <br/>
better. When we first started unschooling (maybe after about 6 <br/>
months or so) I quickly noticed with Shawna that when ever I fell <br/>
into a routine (I would notice it after about 2-3 days) of not <br/>
consistantly connecting with her and being involved in what she was <br/>
interested in, she would start to slowly fall apart. It wasn&#39;t that <br/>
the rules had to be put back in place - it was that I had to get <br/>
involved again. Sure, there are times we&#39;re all off and doing our <br/>
own thing (my kids are 9, 12 & 15) but I don&#39;t let time go by with <br/>
out connecting and talking and interacting. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s something I wrote a bit ago:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; � It&#39;s hard to trust, for me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For most everyone!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; � I was schooled in a school building...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As were 99% of the people! :-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; � At this point, I CAN&#39;T let my son have all the screen time he&#39;d  <br/>
&gt; like.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Probably most of the people have something they aren&#39;t ready to let  <br/>
go of.<br/>
<br/>
But the list is to provide help and support for the practices someone  <br/>
*has decided they want to change* not the practices they want to hold  <br/>
onto.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately that gives the impression that everyone on the list is  <br/>
perfect, that it&#39;s easy to just let go of old ways and all they need  <br/>
is some tips on what to do instead!<br/>
<br/>
But I think a better way to look at the list is to picture everyone  <br/>
with a dozen practices they&#39;re holding onto that make their own life  <br/>
easier and less fearful. The practices are like balloons that support  <br/>
their fears because their fears are threatening to pull them into a  <br/>
bottomless abyss. They *want* to hold onto the balloons and they  <br/>
can&#39;t understand why people find it so easy to let go.<br/>
<br/>
It *isn&#39;t* easy to let go! It&#39;s scary! It takes some uncomfortable  <br/>
self examination to let go. But what you&#39;re seeing displayed on the  <br/>
list is the one balloon someone has decided to let go of. You&#39;re just  <br/>
not seeing the other 11 balloons they&#39;re still holding onto. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
When people decide to let go, when they bring a practice to the list  <br/>
that they want help with, it isn&#39;t because it&#39;s easy. It&#39;s because  <br/>
they&#39;ve been examining that practice in a new light and they don&#39;t  <br/>
like the new vision. The new vision makes them more uncomfortable  <br/>
than the fear. One of their balloons doesn&#39;t look so comforting any  <br/>
more. They were only seeing the balloon part of the practice that was  <br/>
holding them up and supporting their fears, but now they&#39;ve seen the  <br/>
lead part that was weighing down their kids and holding themselves  <br/>
back. They&#39;ve reached the point with that practice where they&#39;ve  <br/>
said, &quot;Yes, it&#39;s scary to let go, but I can now see that where this  <br/>
balloon is taking me is even scarier. And I want help letting go.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t assume that everyone has let go of all their balloons!<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t assume that letting go is easy! You just haven&#39;t seen all the  <br/>
self-examination that has gone on in private as people read the list  <br/>
without posting. This is the list to post to when you&#39;ve decided to  <br/>
let go.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s also a good list to read to help you get to the point where  <br/>
you want to let go of a practice.<br/>
<br/>
It just isn&#39;t a good place to tell people why you aren&#39;t ready to let  <br/>
go ;-) Because everyone who posts regularly has let go of at least  <br/>
one balloon and is eager to help others let go of the ones they now  <br/>
see were weighing them down.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; � At this point, I CAN&#39;T let my son have all the screen time he&#39;d  <br/>
&gt; like.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When you&#39;re ready to work on that, it will help yourself *hugely* to  <br/>
see that you are *choosing* not to let him. You don&#39;t like the  <br/>
consequences (they *are* temporary consequences!) of letting him have  <br/>
all the screen time he&#39;d like. So you are *choosing* to limit.<br/>
<br/>
If there is one piece of advice I could give people it would be to  <br/>
see everything they do as a choice. It is so incredibly freeing :-)  <br/>
It seems like the only reason we do so many unpleasant things in life  <br/>
is because we don&#39;t have a choice. But it&#39;s the perception of not  <br/>
having a choice makes them doubly onerous.<br/>
<br/>
As an example, I hated cleaning the toilet. It was just something you  <br/>
had to do every week (or month ;-) And just because I had to do it, I  <br/>
never wanted to and fought against it, often avoiding my  <br/>
responsibility for 6 months! But when I realized it was a choice,  <br/>
that I could choose to never ever ever scrub the toilet again, I  <br/>
realized that it was nice to see it not filthy. I could choose� when  <br/>
I wanted to!�to have a clean toilet. And I found that once I realized  <br/>
there wasn&#39;t anyone making me clean, that I cleaned it a lot more often.<br/>
<br/>
If you decide to let him have all the screen time he&#39;d like I promise  <br/>
you it will be hard! It will be hard to make the decision. It will be  <br/>
hard on you to let go of control over a piece of your life. It will  <br/>
be hard to see the new problems letting go creates. But the place on  <br/>
the other side on beyond this transition period where your son sees  <br/>
screen time as just another thing to do and not something precious to  <br/>
be coveted is a really awesome place :-) And it will be worth it.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s only when you have read enough to see that there&#39;s something  <br/>
better, when you&#39;ve reflected on the tension in the house and feel  <br/>
that tension doesn&#39;t seem a good enough compromise to prevent  <br/>
something that isn&#39;t seeming as scary as it once was, only then will  <br/>
you be one of the perceived &quot;perfect&quot; ones who posts to the list and  <br/>
says &quot;Okay, I&#39;ve let go, now what?&quot; ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I hope this group is open enough for me to be able to admit that  <br/>
without serious accusations of being inadequate or such.<br/>
<br/>
This seems to be the crux of the difficulties people have with this  <br/>
type of list. Many people want places to vent, where they can air  <br/>
their faults and have others say &quot;Yes, I have that exact same  <br/>
problem. I know what you&#39;re going through because I&#39;m going through  <br/>
the same thing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what support lists are for :-)<br/>
<br/>
This is a discussion list. It&#39;s a place to work out the things you&#39;ve  <br/>
decided to work on.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe there are two types of people: People who want to work out  <br/>
their problems in private while getting support for how hard it is.  <br/>
And people who recognize that not being perfect is part of life and  <br/>
want a place to work on being better.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if it&#39;s personality or school that causes people to think  <br/>
they&#39;re bad for not doing everything right? Probably personality but  <br/>
then school makes it worse :-/ But no one on the list sees anyone as  <br/>
bad for not doing everything &quot;right&quot;. No one expects everyone to be  <br/>
doing everything &quot;right&quot;. Because there isn&#39;t &quot;right&quot; so much as  <br/>
there is actively working towards better, or moving towards  <br/>
unschooling instead of away. And the list is a place to work towards  <br/>
better. Any posts are assumed to be a request for help. It&#39;s the next  <br/>
step beyond &quot;Life&#39;s hard.&quot; That&#39;s why there isn&#39;t much support for  <br/>
&quot;It&#39;s hard,&quot; and &quot;I can&#39;t.&quot; This type of list is the place to go when  <br/>
you want to ask &quot;So what do I do about that? How do I make it less  <br/>
hard. How do I move beyond &#39;I can&#39;t&#39;.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; � I know I may get flamed for this but I&#39;m working on it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not flames. It&#39;s help to move on! :-)<br/>
<br/>
The list is just not a support list where people can post about how  <br/>
hard life is and sympathize with each other.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, life&#39;s hard. Let&#39;s talk about the things we&#39;re ready to change  <br/>
so it&#39;s not so hard! :-)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because the point of the list is to help people let go of the  <br/>
practices that hamper unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Most practices of good parents *are* well intended. Parents want  <br/>
their kids to be the best they can be and work toward that.  <br/>
Spankings, groundings, lectures, time outs, limitations, curfews,  <br/>
rules are all well intended. The problem is that most parents feel  <br/>
they can&#39;t get the results they want any other way and, if they do  <br/>
see the downside of those methods, they feel the outcome is worth it.<br/>
<br/>
Parents do see other parents who use those methods have kids that  <br/>
turn out fine. The problem is that the parents don&#39;t know why the  <br/>
kids turn out okay. (Or seem to be okay.) They assume it&#39;s the  <br/>
methods. The methods *seem* like they should work. But they can&#39;t  <br/>
really know for sure.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The origin of this topic, I assumed was someone asking for support<br/>
&gt; from other unschooling non-screen families, and perhaps wanting a<br/>
&gt; better insight of these families work around thier tv issues and a<br/>
&gt; little bit of support.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, she was just asking what the days look like in families where  <br/>
there&#39;s little screen time. She didn&#39;t specify families who limited.<br/>
<br/>
The list is specifically for supporting people who are trying to let  <br/>
go of what gets in the way of unschooling and mindful parenting, not  <br/>
supporting &quot;good intentions&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What I&#39;m trying to say is, if we can accord such courtesy and respect<br/>
&gt; to our unschooling children, that we do allow them to make mistakes<br/>
&gt; and not critisized them for it. Why can we do the same for other<br/>
&gt; parents?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a question that often gets asked and it seems reasonable.<br/>
<br/>
The huge difference is that our kids are growing into who they are.  <br/>
We aren&#39;t their shapers or molders. We&#39;re there to support who they are.<br/>
<br/>
This list isn&#39;t a &quot;support whatever&quot; list. It&#39;s a list where people  <br/>
can ask specific questions about letting go of practices that get in  <br/>
the way of unschooling, and working with practices that help it.<br/>
<br/>
The two goals are entirely different.<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of the list is not support of whatever practices families  <br/>
who call themselves unschoolers are doing. There *are* lists for  <br/>
which that *is* the goal. Nothing wrong with that goal., It&#39;s just  <br/>
different than this lists goal. This list&#39;s goal is to help those  <br/>
people who want to change.<br/>
<br/>
Out in the real world, I&#39;m supportive of whatever pace the parents  <br/>
around me want to take. I talk a bit about unschooling if they&#39;re  <br/>
interested. They can take it or leave it. The goal in my real life  <br/>
relationships isn&#39;t to help them understand unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Nowhere did it say, if you&#39;re still unsure about going 100%<br/>
&gt; unschooling, your non-unschooling ideas that worked for you, might<br/>
&gt; get critised.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, it does. &quot;Ask experienced unschoolers all those niggling  <br/>
questions, and find out how unschooling works in real families.&quot;<br/>
Would it be clearer if it said &quot;how the unschooling philosophy looks  <br/>
in practice&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Does this means if I&#39;m not ready to release full control to my son<br/>
&gt; with regards to tv or anything for that matter, does that invalidate<br/>
&gt; all these unschooling living that we&#39;ve been doing for the past 11<br/>
&gt; months?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why do you need people here to validate your unschooling life?<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a serious question.<br/>
<br/>
Because the list isn&#39;t for validating anyone. It&#39;s specifically for  <br/>
helping people let go of stuff that interferes with unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I think the problem is that when ideas get held up for examination,  <br/>
the person who holds the idea feels like they&#39;re being examined. Not  <br/>
so. Just the idea. *No one* is saying &quot;You&#39;re a bad unschooler.&quot; (No  <br/>
one&#39;s handing out unschooling badges so we don&#39;t label anyone!) We  <br/>
*do* say &quot;That idea will hamper unschooling. That idea will whittle  <br/>
away at your relationship with your kids.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The list is less about what people do and more about helping them  <br/>
understand *so* they can go off and try to put it into practice. (And  <br/>
come back and get help tweaking where things got off track.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And I very frequently<br/>
&gt; tells her it&#39;s ok and it&#39;s not the end of the world if she&#39;s chickens<br/>
&gt; out of relinquishing certain control back to her very active son<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Different people take different paths in real life when helping someone.<br/>
<br/>
Some lists are about supporting people&#39;s own slow journey to  <br/>
unschooling. It&#39;s about supporting each other in how difficult it can  <br/>
be to trust and let go. Some people need that.<br/>
<br/>
This list is for those who want to work on parts that are troubling  <br/>
them. Not necessarily let go of everything, but work on parts. This  <br/>
is where people work that out. (Or read while other brave souls work  <br/>
it out ;-) It&#39;s just a different kind of list because different  <br/>
people need this kind of list and don&#39;t find the support lists  <br/>
useful. When they say &quot;This is hard!&quot; they don&#39;t want &quot;Yes, it is.  <br/>
You&#39;re doing fine.&quot; They want concrete help on what they&#39;re doing  <br/>
wrong and how they can do it better.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Don&#39;t be hard<br/>
&gt; on yourself. You can&#39;t do everything in one day. When you&#39;re ready,<br/>
&gt; you will let go quite willingly, painlessly, and confidently.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yup. That&#39;s what the list is for.<br/>
<br/>
The difference is that this type of list works best for people who  <br/>
know they aren&#39;t going to get it all right at once. But they know  <br/>
they need a goal to work  towards. They don&#39;t need to hear &quot;You&#39;re  <br/>
okay!&quot; They know they&#39;re okay. What they don&#39;t know is how to get to  <br/>
where they want to go (unschooling). So they ask for help.<br/>
<br/>
This list *isn&#39;t* for everyone trying to unschool.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; hard. How do I move beyond &#39;I can&#39;t&#39;.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is lovely - and very much a principle of unschooling as applied <br/>
to our kids, too. Conventional parenting stops at &quot;Life&#39;s hard&quot; - I <br/>
can&#39;t even begin to catalog the times and ways I&#39;ve heard parents <br/>
express that to kids as a way to end an argument. Life&#39;s hard. No <br/>
free lunch. Can&#39;t always get what you want. End of story. <br/>
Unschooling *starts* exactly there. Life&#39;s hard - so let me help <br/>
you. <br/>
<br/>
With my deschooling teen, &quot;let me help you&quot; isn&#39;t always the best <br/>
thing to say, directly. He&#39;s not *supposed* to need help. It takes <br/>
time to (re)build a relationship to a place of trusting support. <br/>
That&#39;s true of discussion lists as well. It takes time to build <br/>
understanding and trust amongst a group of complete strangers, <br/>
especially since most of us come to the idea of unschooling from <br/>
somewhere else - often from the somewhere of school where <br/>
helpfulness is cheating at best and a set-up for an attack at worst. <br/>
<br/>
One of the ideas I rattle on and on about is that autonomy, at least <br/>
in unschooling jargon, is a whole different ball-game than <br/>
independence. Part of autonomy is trusting that help is available - <br/>
something I usually talk about in terms of supporting our kids, but <br/>
it applies to the adults on this list as well. Most of us were <br/>
raised to respect independence and distrust help. We&#39;re okay getting <br/>
help by the back door, as it were - bitching about our problems in <br/>
order to hear others bitch and maybe grab a nugget or two of useful <br/>
information. Part of deschooling involves developing our own <br/>
autonomy as parents. Being okay with saying &quot;I need some help here&quot; -<br/>
 to our spouses, friends, kids... and other unschoolers. Seeing help <br/>
being offered, rather than critcism. Seeing good intentions. Those <br/>
are some of the unschooling skills that take time and practice to <br/>
learn. <br/>
<br/>
When I first came to unschooling lists I got my feelings hurt alot. <br/>
I expected criticism, so I read every difference as an attack. I <br/>
expected a bitchy old-girl system and felt slapped around. I <br/>
expected to be graded on my performance as an unschooling parent and <br/>
felt like I was getting a D at best. It&#39;s interesting to me to look <br/>
back at some of the same comments that offended and scared me a few <br/>
years ago and see the kindness being offered. It took some <br/>
deschooling on my part to be able to see that kindness - much as it <br/>
has taken some deschooling on my stepson&#39;s part to be able to see <br/>
*my* kindness. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this has turned into something of a ramble, but I wanted to <br/>
say that in many many ways, the same principles we&#39;re trying to <br/>
apply in our families *do* come out on this board. Not always <br/>
skillfully or successfully, maybe, but then that&#39;s true in our <br/>
families too. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1736199318">Hi Joyce,<br/>
   <br/>
  &quot;When they say &quot;This is hard!&quot; they don&#39;t want &quot;Yes, it is. <br/>
You&#39;re doing fine.&quot; They want concrete help on what they&#39;re doing <br/>
wrong and how they can do it better.&quot;<br/>
   <br/>
  &quot;This list *isn&#39;t* for everyone trying to unschool.&quot;<br/>
   <br/>
  Like Ren said ( and perhaps should be included in the description?) <br/>
  &quot;I didn&#39;t start this list to pat people on the back and tell them<br/>
they&#39;re doing just fine if they want to control and manipulate their<br/>
children. This list exists for the purpose of helping people let GO of<br/>
mainstream ideas and ideals.&quot;<br/>
   <br/>
  I can see now where Ren and yourself is coming from. Yes, this list is obviously not for people trying to unschool. It is really for people unschooling already and is ready for more, like you said, with a little tweak here and there to help them push forth. Hence if anybody post anything, condoning limitation in any form, is asking for their head to be &quot;chewed off&quot;. And I suppose there will never be any unschooling list that do not practice zero tolerance <br/>
  towards limitation. I&#39;m sorry but I have to say I am interpreting the &quot;description&quot; to be a very tolerant unschooling list based on this line - <br/>
   <br/>
  &quot;A list designed for those new to the philosophy of unschooling. Ask <br/>
experienced unschoolers all those niggling questions, and find out <br/>
how unschooling works in real families.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Yes, I felt very strongly about this &quot;chewing somebody&#39;s head off &quot; when they are not letting go enough;  just as how strongly you and Ren felt about &quot;limitation&quot;. It&#39;s just that I felt woulnd&#39;t it be better if we can be a little bit more open and diverse? Limitation practices whether it&#39;s intentional or not., we are afterall, all about helping other new unschooling parents who wants to do better for thier children, right? We can only offer our opinion about how life can be better without limits, and insight into our free world. We don&#39;t have to snap at them, do we? <br/>
   <br/>
  The funny thing is I&#39;ve never been &quot;chewed at&quot; by either you or Ren! LOL! And that I&#39;m actually speaking up for these &quot;half-way there&quot; parents, that I don&#39;t even personally know! <br/>
   <br/>
  Oh..well! At least I tried.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>GREAT POST, Meredith! I really enjoyed reading it, another shift in<br/>
perspective for me :)<br/>
I especially had to pull out this part. When the kids were little, I would<br/>
ask my co-attachment-parenting friends about Hayden&#39;s intensity, all I<br/>
received was commiseration or criticism and sometimes delivered with a<br/>
condescending attitude :/ Discussions about RU are totally different for<br/>
me!! Sometimes it was/is painful to look at the possibilities thrown out by<br/>
strangers on a list... and yet, their help was/is real and I did/do *indeed*<br/>
have to look with new eyes at the cause of situations, which meant/means<br/>
often taking a long hard honest look at *myself.*<br/>
Lists for me are not the gentle recommendations of LLL or the camaraderie of<br/>
park day; I love them both for what they are, my real *kick in the pants*<br/>
when it comes to gentle parenting of my kids and this RU lifestyle has come<br/>
from strangers on the lists. The sharing of REAL situations where REAL<br/>
people have REAL interactions and how those lives can be brought with peace<br/>
and respect ~ I know what&#39;s possible because I&#39;m shown time and time again,<br/>
in real life (and in real life stories on the lists) that RU works.<br/>
It&#39;s absolutely worth all the introspection and personal growth it inspires<br/>
:) Oh and it&#39;s good for the kids, too ;)<br/>

Unschooling is tough to *try*<br/>
Telling someone *You have freedom until X* is not really freedom.<br/>
It&#39;s important to be said that unschooling is really and truly a leap of<br/>
faith that cannot be made 1/2 way. You&#39;re either swimming or your not. For<br/>
me, the list exists for those times you&#39;re tempted to put your feet down and<br/>
stop swimming. When you&#39;re really wondering if you should just be on the<br/>
beach instead. Or maybe you&#39;re here to see how much fun the folks in the<br/>
water are having and soon you&#39;ll just jump in yourself.<br/>

an accurate description of a typical response to someone condoning<br/>
limitations on this list. (Nor do I want anyone to clip together validation<br/>
of such). Limitations do not work pro-actively to build trust in<br/>
relationships. period. Not in one&#39;s relationship to Self, not in one&#39;s<br/>
relationship to their child/parent. It&#39;s important be reminded. The whole<br/>
mainstream world is filled with validations for limitations. You can go to<br/>
9,999,999 other websites for that kind of support. Being in the RU<br/>
environment, means those limitations will be examined and looked at; their<br/>
harm pointed out. Stories of REAL folks who live without limitations are<br/>
here, their worlds did not collapse and their children are bright and shiny.<br/>

   My answer is always &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;. Therefore, no reason to control/ <br/>
monitor<br/>
him now, as I want to be sure that all the decisions that my son makes, <br/>
from now<br/>
onwards, is his own. I do not want surprises when he&#39;s 15, where he&#39;s <br/>
might do a<br/>
total &quot;flip&quot;, just like all my friends teenage kids&#39; done. Why the <br/>
surprise?<br/>
That&#39;s because when they are teen, they all of a sudden realised they <br/>
have a<br/>
choice, the choice to listen to mum/ dad, or the choice to follow thier <br/>
heart.<br/>
Naturally the heart  always wins.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t always win.<br/>
<br/>
How many adults do you know that listened to their parents or society <br/>
and decided to make a career out of something that they have little <br/>
interest in? Only to *finally* change their minds and take on a <br/>
different career that makes them happy? If they hadn&#39;&#39;t been persuaded <br/>
by others, they could have come to that conclusion years before.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Which explains the moans of &quot;they are not<br/>
doing what they always do;  this is so unlike them;  I don&#39;t know why <br/>
he has<br/>
changed&quot; &quot;they won&#39;t listen!&quot; . That&#39;s because &quot;what they always do&quot;, <br/>
is not<br/>
thier choice but merely the adults (parents, relatives, society).<br/>

<br/>
I was really upset by 2 particular reply, which I felt was a little<br/>
bit harsh and vey critical of sharilynn29&#39;s belief,<br/>
And it&#39;s not only this post. Like many post before, I&#39;ve noticed<br/>
parents with good intentions posting thier advice and opinion, gets<br/>
critisized for non &quot;unschooling&quot; praticises.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s because it&#39;s an UNSCHOOLING list, and any advice that is counter <br/>
to unschooling will be criticized---no matter what the intentions.<br/>
<br/>
Ever been on a vegetarian e-list and suggested that folks that eat just <br/>
a little meat are still vegetarians and maybe *should* eat a little <br/>
meat because it&#39;s good for you? Try it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
The origin of this topic, I assumed was someone asking for support<br/>
from other unschooling non-screen families, and perhaps wanting a<br/>
better insight of these families work around thier tv issues and a<br/>
little bit of support. And many did reply, offering scenarios of<br/>
thier approach to tv, some are very suportive of tv, some not so,<br/>
which was great, because now the person have a wide choice of options<br/>
to mull about.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
All those posts were made by people new to unschooling AND parents of <br/>
very young children. We let those posts go through, but no one was <br/>
going to let them BE unschooling advice about TVs. It *will* get <br/>
challenged.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 And for a non-screen parent to offer some insights of<br/>
how thier &quot;limited screen time&quot; work in thier lives, it is offered in<br/>
good faith.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Good faith or not, it doesn&#39;t jive with helping others understand how <br/>
NOT limiting things *does* work. It doesn&#39;t help others understand <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 She believes in what she<br/>
constitudes to be addictive behaviour in her children, and is doing<br/>
what she believes is best for her children.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
TV is NOT addictive. It&#39;s entertaining and informative...and often the <br/>
most interesting thing in the house. By limiting it and making it a <br/>
scarcity, she&#39;s making it even *more* attractive to her children. <br/>
Bringing *more* entertaining, *more* informative, *more* interesting <br/>
things into their lives will decrease their viewing---simply because <br/>
children LIKE interesting, informative entertainment. If she&#39;s failing <br/>
in that respect, her children *should* watch more TV. But they aren&#39;t <br/>
addicted.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
But that doeasn&#39;t mean<br/>
she felt we &quot;tv believing parents&quot; was irreponsible to allow our<br/>
children to be tv- addict zombie. I don&#39;t think anybody should take<br/>
it as a personal insult! She was merely stating what she believes is<br/>
working for them. (How and why, we won&#39;t know because we are not part<br/>
of her family). And that to her the tv can invoke the addicitive<br/>
element, in her and her children and she&#39;s found a way to balance<br/>
that.  And this is possible. I have known of some children or adults<br/>
who&#39;s just not interested in tvs or pc at all, what luck for the<br/>
parents!!<br/>
<br/>
---=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
It has nothing to do with luck. And if the *goal* is not to watch <br/>
TV---whatthehell???<br/>
<br/>
Would you say the same for reading? &quot;I have known of some children or <br/>
adults who are just not interested in books or reading at all. What <br/>
luck for the parents!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Would THAT make sense? Would that be lauded?<br/>
<br/>
TV is NOT the enemy. It&#39;s just a box.<br/>
<br/>
Each and every one of us has the means and opportunity to watch TV all <br/>
day. I *have* done it! Days I&#39;m not feeling well. Days that there&#39;s a <br/>
M*A*S*H or Law & Order marathon. &lt;g&gt; But mostly it&#39;s off. It is now. I <br/>
could turn it on, I&#39;m CHOOSING not to. Why would I do that? Why, when I <br/>
can do whatever I want, am I choosing to NOT watch TV?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m trying to say is, if we can accord such courtesy and respect<br/>
to our unschooling children, that we do allow them to make mistakes<br/>
and not critisized them for it. Why can we do the same for other<br/>
parents?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Because I assume that, when someone joins an unschooling list of her <br/>
own volition, she actually wants to understand and embrace unschooling. <br/>
Odd assumption, maybe---but to me it makes sense. I also assume that <br/>
all of us will/do make mistakes (we call them learning-takes). But <br/>
stating that TV is addictive isn&#39;t a mistake. It&#39;s a belief or <br/>
misinformation---or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I won&#39;t let a misunderstanding of how unschooling works cloud the <br/>
message of this list.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And that we all believed we shouldn&#39;t impose our opinions,<br/>
likes and dislikes onto our children, why then are some of us,<br/>
stating so strong of our disagreement of another parents point of<br/>
view? And that to disecting, analysing and critisizing thier words/<br/>
actions of not being able to relinquish full control and trust to<br/>
thier child?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
No one has to be on this list. No one has to take our suggestions <br/>
seriously. No one has to unschool.<br/>
<br/>
But if you&#39;re on the list in order to understand how to make <br/>
unschooling work in *your* home, I expect you to work at it and to <br/>
seriously consider what is being offered here. Not that I would ever <br/>
know what you&#39;re doing. But I know many, many families who have been <br/>
changed for the better from reading here (and other lists) and putting <br/>
the suggestions into practice.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Description of the frnt page of Unschoolingbasics.<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
Nowhere did it say, if you&#39;re not 100% unschooling, you&#39;re not<br/>
welcome. Nowhere did it say, if you&#39;re still unsure about going 100%<br/>
unschooling, your non-unschooling ideas that worked for you, might<br/>
get critised.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Exactly HOW would non-unschooling ideas work in an unschooling home?<br/>
<br/>
-==-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Is it right that I should worry about sharing some of<br/>
my experience or post my ignorant non -unschooling opinions, and face<br/>
the possibility of being critized?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think posting non-unschooling questions is good.<br/>
<br/>
Posting non-unschooling opinions will get questions and <br/>
criticized---yes, on an unschooling list.<br/>
<br/>
You expect them to get accepted as, &quot;well, yeah--whatever works for <br/>
you&quot;  ??<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I do get very upset if I&#39;m<br/>
critised because it&#39;s basically telling me I&#39;m not good enough. Or<br/>
that my ideas are rubbish. I get very upset seeng other parents being<br/>
critised because I see it as bullying, and not the &quot;constructive<br/>
critism&quot; as one might try to defend it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
*People* aren&#39;t being criticized. Their ideas or actions *are*.<br/>
<br/>
And if *you* feel not good enough, that&#39;s something *you* might need to <br/>
work on.<br/>
<br/>
*Many* ideas are rubbish. The majority of the world thinks that the <br/>
idea of unschooling is rubbish. Does that make me feel &quot;not good <br/>
enough&quot;? Should it?<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t control how upset *you* get or why. I can do something about <br/>
how upset my own children feel if I were to turn off or limit their TV <br/>
viewing. Or throw away their game pieces because I didn&#39;t want to put <br/>
them away. *YOU* can choose to help your children navigate their worlds <br/>
OR you can navigate their worlds for them by limiting and being <br/>
resentful of the work you must put into it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
It makes me question how much freedom am I allowed to share my<br/>
problems, experience and beliefs on this list, without getting a<br/>
sharp reprove?  What works for my family, might not work for another,<br/>
but then maybe, just maybe, my answer might be able to provide some<br/>
better alternative ideas, some comfort or perhaps support.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe. But if your answer won&#39;t hold water,....<br/>
<br/>
Can you defend your position? Just because you have an answer, does it <br/>
make it a good solution? Does it fit within unschooling principles of <br/>
trust and respect, patience and generosity?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Does this means if I&#39;m not ready to release full control to my son<br/>
with regards to tv or anything for that matter, does that invalidate<br/>
all these unschooling living that we&#39;ve been doing for the past 11<br/>
months?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Are you working towards a more joyful, respectful, trusting <br/>
relationship?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-==-=-<br/>
<br/>
The last thing we need when appealing to this list for comfort and<br/>
support, or  share &quot;well meaning&quot; non-schooling ways of doing things,<br/>
to help further ease the burden and scary journey into &quot;letting go of<br/>
central command&quot;, is being told we&#39;re not unschooling enough, or that<br/>
we&#39;re failing our children because of not being able to release full<br/>
control to him! What a slap to the face and confidence!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=--=<br/>
<br/>
This list is not here for comfort or support. So you&#39;re right when you <br/>
say that it is the &quot;last thing&quot; we need.<br/>
<br/>
Not that the list doesn&#39;t give comfort and support. Indeed it often <br/>
does. But that&#39;s not its purpose or intent.<br/>
<br/>
If I were to agree that TV is addictive and that it&#39;s OK for parents to <br/>
be resentful and vindictive, would that actually HELP someone unschool? <br/>
How exactly would that help? If I were to agree that arbitrary limits <br/>
are necessary in some familes, how would that help someone ease into <br/>
unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s only fair that everyone is allowed to post and received<br/>
any message, no matter how silly/ non-unschooling it is, without any<br/>
prejudice.<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
It might seem fair to *you*. We moderate posts until we feel that <br/>
person isn&#39;t going to spam or be a nuisance---so not *all* messages go <br/>
through.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And that we are allowed the full freedom and the trust<br/>
that we will know what&#39;s best for our children and will eventually<br/>
learn to let go, slow but surely.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I have absolutley NO control over what any list member does at home. <br/>
NONE.<br/>
<br/>
You DO have full freedom to do whatever you want at home. (You do not <br/>
necessarily have that freedom on this list.) I can trust you will do <br/>
what you feel is best with your children. I would hope you wouldn&#39;t do <br/>
what&#39;s not in their best interests.<br/>
