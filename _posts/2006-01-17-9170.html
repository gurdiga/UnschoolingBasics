<div id="ygrps-yiv-134960914">Hi everyone, I joined quite a while ago then took some time away from the<br/>
computer to try to reorganize my life.  I just happened to start reading my<br/>
digests again and have to say 1st, I LOVE the &quot;unschooling right this<br/>
minute&quot; posts!  It helps me see that we still have a lot of deschooling to<br/>
do.  But that is for another post...<br/>
<br/>
I saw this thread on bedtimes and something we struggle with my 1 year old<br/>
on is sleep in general...I wont go into details as this would end up a<br/>
novel...but the replies of the kids going to bed whenever and the parents<br/>
saying up till they decide to go to bed makes me wonder something this<br/>
control freak (current member of CA) can&#39;t wrap her brain around.  I do not<br/>
mean this to offend anyone, really just trying to understand the thought<br/>
process so maybe, just maybe I can get a step closer to graduating from CA.<br/>
Do the kids run the household or am I missing something here?  Because what<br/>
I see happening in this house (since the baby doesn&#39;t sleep well) is me<br/>
being much more tired and cranky than I already am just because I waited for<br/>
my 11 yr old to go to bed...which given to him would be midnight or later...<br/>
<br/>
Even just the thought of that makes me wanna cry...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2008888592">***I saw this thread on bedtimes and something we struggle with my 1 year<br/>

<br/>
List members might be able to give you more ideas if you describe a<br/>
typical bedtime routine, if there is such a thing.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When Dylan was little I didn&#39;t have a bedtime.  Instead I watched for<br/>
signs of sleepiness.  When he would stand and look at something and rub<br/>
his little head or twirl his hair round his finger, I knew he was getting<br/>
tired.   <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t tell him it was time for bed and I didn&#39;t make him leave his<br/>
toys but I started to quiet the house.  I dimmed the lights, turned down<br/>
the TV, changed into my pj&#39;s.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I would ask &quot;can I hold you?&quot;  and we would snuggle on the sofa<br/>
or in the rocking chair.  He might bring a toy or two with him.  I would<br/>
talk quietly.  <br/>
<br/>
Dylan nursed until he was four and very often when we were close and the<br/>
house was quiet and he was tired he&#39;d want to nurse.  That almost always<br/>
eased him into sleep.  If I still had things I wanted to do once he was<br/>
asleep I&#39;d put him in our bed or on the sofa and collect him when I went<br/>
to bed.  <br/>
<br/>
There are some things about traditional bedtime that set a mom and kid up<br/>
for struggle.  Kids don&#39;t want to leave the action or leave their stuff. <br/>
So easing a little one into sleep where the action (at a quieter and<br/>
dimmer level) and stuff is can mean a more peaceful transition to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
When bedtime means a child has to be alone in his room in the dark and<br/>
the child wants to be in the light with people he loves, that&#39;s a<br/>
struggle.  Kids can sleep anywhere, on a cushion under the table, in a<br/>
chair, on the sofa, in mom&#39;s bed, in mom&#39;s arms.   There&#39;s no reason a<br/>
child needs to be in his own room for sleep.  <br/>
<br/>
When the mom decides the child should sleep and the child isn&#39;t ready for<br/>
sleep yet, that&#39;s a struggle.  It might not be as convenient to the mom<br/>
to watch for signs and ease baby into the quiet and into sleep but it&#39;s<br/>
more peaceful, less stressful for both.  <br/>
<br/>
A lot of struggle comes from a mom who wants things to be a certain way<br/>
and a baby who has a different idea.  What is your baby&#39;s idea of a good<br/>
way to fall asleep?  He might not be able to tell you, but you can find<br/>
out.  <br/>
<br/>
 ***me<br/>
being much more tired and cranky than I already am just because I waited<br/>
for<br/>
my 11 yr old to go to bed...  ***<br/>
<br/>
Is there some reason your eleven year old can&#39;t be up without you?   If<br/>
he knows he can come and get you if he needs you, and if he has access to<br/>
snacks or whatever else he needs can&#39;t he just be up until he&#39;s ready to<br/>
go to bed? <br/>
<br/>
Dylan was eight or so when he began to enjoy being up late.  I told him<br/>
he could come get me if he needed anything.  I asked him to please stay<br/>
in the house, I left snacks in convenient places and asked him to turn<br/>
out the lights when he went to bed.   <br/>
<br/>
***Do the kids run the household or am I missing something here? ***<br/>
<br/>
By this I think you mean - Do the kids go wild, disregard their parents<br/>
and do just whatever destructive awful, thing they can think of ? -   <br/>
<br/>
If there are kids who would go wild they are probably kids who&#39;ve had a<br/>
long power struggle with their parents.  If kids have felt powerless -<br/>
have been told when to sleep and when to wake, have been told what to eat<br/>
and what not to eat, have been told what they can do, etc. then they<br/>
might be hungry for power and it might be expressed by doing all those<br/>
things a parent has restricted.  If a kid has felt disregarded,<br/>
disrespected by having his desires repeatedly turned down or dismissed he<br/>
might not see the value in regard and respect for others.   If this<br/>
scenario exists it&#39;s because it was systematically constructed by the<br/>
parents, even though they didn&#39;t want to construct such a thing and<br/>
didn&#39;t know they were doing it.  Unschooling can end the destructive<br/>
power struggle between parents and children.<br/>
<br/>
When there is no power struggle there&#39;s no negative implication behind<br/>
the idea of a kid running the household.  My kid could absolutely run<br/>
this household.  He&#39;s responsible and confident.  But we never think of<br/>
it like that do we?  We never think that one of the things we hope as<br/>
parents is that a kid could one day run a household! (in all it&#39;s good<br/>
implications).  We worry that if we let up on our controls for a minute<br/>
our kids will &quot;run all over us.&quot;   Bummer. <br/>
Why would we want to think of our kids like that?  Our kids are nice<br/>
people. <br/>
<br/>
And if you&#39;re a family then the household is as much your son&#39;s as yours.<br/>
 Why shouldn&#39;t he have power and freedom there?  When no power struggle<br/>
exists kids don&#39;t go crazy and do terrible things the minute their<br/>
parents aren&#39;t looking.   There&#39;s no reason for them to go crazy.  <br/>
<br/>
So, if you have concerns about what your eleven year old would do if you<br/>
went to bed and left him up alone, talk about those here and get ideas<br/>
for changing the dynamic in your house so that you can feel ok going to<br/>
bed and he can feel happily secure staying up by himself. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-739760400">&lt;&lt;because I waited for my 11yo to go to sleep&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No one here is advocating doing anything to make yourself tired and cranky.  Having a toddler is a full time job and you need rest.  What we do advocate is thinking outside the box so that as much as possible, EVERYONE is happy and gets their needs met.  You might try simply being more flexible and seeing what happens.  You may not NEED to stay up with an 11yo or you may.  You won&#39;t know unless you try.  If you try something and it doesn&#39;t work well, see where the kinks are, see if there is a way you can work them out.<br/>
<br/>
Example:  I am 42 and pregnant with my 6th child.  I&#39;m wore out.  My dh travels ALOT.  Last night, I really, really needed to go to sleep (this was at 8:30).  So I asked my 12yo if he would mind helping the younger kids to bed.  He agreed and then I talked with my younger ones (ages, 9, 7 and 6).  I talked to them about how tired I&#39;ve been and needing to rest.  We talked about when we thought would be a good time for everyone to go to bed.  Then I went to sleep.  I heard no fussing, no arguing.  When I got up this morning, everything was turned off and the kids were still asleep in their beds.<br/>
<br/>
We just got back from a stockshow this last weekend where all the showers sleep in the big barns with their animals.  The lights stay on and the bigger kids tend to stay up all night talking and playing around.  My little 9yo went to bed before 10 every night with zero prompting from me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-578497727">Well, let me say my one year old does run the household much as my son did<br/>
when he was that age. Infants don&#39;t see beyond their needs so we need to<br/>
meet theirs until they can. Meeting their needs make them feel important and<br/>
secure which is important at that age. We (in my house) believe in family<br/>
bed so my son slept with us until he asked for his own bed around the age of<br/>
two - I see my daughter around the same age or sooner then that or asking to<br/>
sleep with Quentin.<br/>
<br/>
If that isn&#39;t an option you have to find something that works for you - all<br/>
I know is everyone (outside my house) said I had to get Quentin so start<br/>
sleeping in his own bed at 6 months and him screaming in his crib and<br/>
getting up and down and me getting no sleep didn&#39;t work for me.<br/>
<br/>
A girlfriend of mine put a mattress next to her bed for her kids that needed<br/>
to be closer to their parents. There are lots of theories but the most<br/>
important one is the one that works for you. So no matter what anyone says<br/>
do what is best for you and your child.  <br/>
