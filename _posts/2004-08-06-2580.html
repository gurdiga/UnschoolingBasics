<div id="ygrps-yiv-678280343">&quot;So my next question would be how do I start giving myself permission to just<br/>
DO something that intrigues me without proof of my long term interest?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As Nike says &quot;Just DO It&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Seriously though, if I get intrigued with something, I try to act on it while the interest is there. After I intensely explore something (sometimes for a few days, sometimes for months) I&#39;m usually done with it for a long time. In this way, I&#39;ve given myself a damn good liberal arts education, without college!:)<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s see, I have supplies for altered books and two books that have been started and put on hold for a while....I&#39;ll get back to them when I&#39;m ready. I keep a lot of art supplies around for all kinds of projects, art is one constant in my life, but the projects and interests levels change a lot.<br/>
As a writer, I usually have several writing projects in limbo...when I get stuck on one, I can move to another (see, being neurotic is GOOD).<br/>
Lately, my obsession has been philosophy. I&#39;ve been reading stuff on Plato, Socrates and other philosophers...some of it too heavy and makes my head hurt, but I&#39;m fascinated nonetheless. A study of Semiotics led me to a great series of pro-tv studies...very cool.<br/>
<br/>
I have an ongoing interest in wines and plan to take a class soon.<br/>
Taking a short course on something can be a great way to satisfy an interest if you aren&#39;t sure how to dive in on your own (rarely a problem for me).<br/>
I always have other countries or time periods snag me, but a steady ongoing interest in medieval times has led to a lot of fun... I haven&#39;t attended an event or re-enactment in over a year, maybe I will again when I feel like it! I&#39;ve gotten obsessed with authentic medieval food and after reading for days I did a meal at home, we all dressed up in costumes and had dinner. Then I was done with medieval food for a LONG time.:)<br/>
I think it&#39;s really beneficial to have many interests...you know how many people you can connect with in this life, by understanding and having some knowledge of MANY things? It&#39;s cool. I can have semi-intelligent conversations with people from many walks of life. I LIKE my neurotic self. lol<br/>
<br/>
So next time the urge strikes Sherry, just go for it! Giving yourself permission is very freeing. And if the materials sit unused, don&#39;t despair, you never know when someone else will need it, or you will get excited again. It&#39;s better to have the materials on hand when you&#39;re inspired.<br/>
<br/>
I had a Vermeer calendar that had sat for about a year, gathering dust with a bunch of other art calendars (I bought on sale to have examples of the artitsts work on hand). We watched &quot;Girl with the pearl earring&quot; one night and boy was I glad we had that calendar and all my art books. We looked at the real pictures Vermeer did, versus the ones they used in the movie. It was really great.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-181271284">Hi Ren,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for this. After reading this and the other responses, I can&#39;t tell<br/>
you how my attitude has changed and in what seems like such an easy way. I<br/>
feel more free to express an interest in something without feeling any<br/>
further responsibility to it.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My mom is here visiting, and we were talking about my college diploma. I<br/>
started it in 1981 went till 1983 and due to too much enjoyment of life free<br/>
from the limits and rules of my mom, I didn&#39;t do so well and ended up not<br/>
finishing. Well when I was sick and on disability, they wanted to retrain<br/>
me, so instead of starting something new I looked into finishing this<br/>
diploma. It was something I wanted to do, meant a lot because it was very<br/>
close to my fathers field, he had paid for the first incomplete effort and I<br/>
wanted to finish it for me but also for him. So I looked into it and<br/>
finished it and in 1996 graduated. So 15 years to do a 2 year diploma:-) Of<br/>
course during that time, I had three careers, lived in a couple of foreign<br/>
countries and did a bunch of other stuff that was pretty exciting.  So mom<br/>
and I were talking about it and I made a comment that this month was my last<br/>
payment on my student loan. And somewhere in the conversation I commented on<br/>
how pleased I was that I had finished it and she said &quot;it&#39;s just too bad it<br/>
too you so long&quot; And I looked at her and said &quot;why? What difference does it<br/>
make how long it took?&quot; And I felt so pleased with myself to be able to say<br/>
that to her.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
That is because of this conversation.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Last night I heard the word &quot;yurt&quot; for the first time. had to look into it<br/>
and spent an hour looking at them on the web. Now I know about them and I<br/>
doubt I will spend a lot of time looking into them anymore. but it is one<br/>
more bit of info. This unschooling road is pretty cool.<br/>
