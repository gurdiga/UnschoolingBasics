 </span></blockquote>Generally, the term &#39;unschooling&#39; refers to an educational <br/>
philosophy that is &#39;not school&#39;, doesn&#39;t look like school, sound <br/>
like school, feel like school. It is based on trusting that people, <br/>
including kids since they&#39;re people too, will learn what they need <br/>
when and how they need it in ways that work for them. &quot;Radical&quot; <br/>
unschooling is taking that philosophy of trust and applying it to <br/>
the rest of life - trusting that our kids will eat what and when and <br/>
how works for them, that they&#39;ll sleep when their body says sleep <br/>
and wake when they&#39;re finished with sleep, and so on. Treating kids <br/>
with the same trust and respect for their individual selves and <br/>
choices that you would for a spouse, friend, other adult person.<br/>
<br/>
So, someone can be unschooling in the academic sense yet have <br/>
strictly structured bedtimes, chores, mealtimes, etc. &quot;radical&quot; was <br/>
added to differentiate in discussion between folks who extend <br/>
unschooling into the whole life of the family.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-428373617">Got it.  Well then I&#39;m -almost- a radical homeschooler.  We do <br/>
impose a bedtime, in that they have to be in bed by a certain time, <br/>

is more due to the house schedule so my husband can get his sleep <br/>
for work and I can get work done at night for my paying job (I work <br/>
freelance).<br/>
<br/>
I am facing a current problem and would appreciate some insight.  My <br/>
just turned 3 year old still isn&#39;t potty trained (egads! I know, but <br/>
I&#39;m not a bad mom, really!).  He was speech delayed, but we&#39;re up to <br/>
par now and working on articulation.  He is capable of going on the <br/>
potty (has done so once or twice when he was at the preschool) and <br/>
he can do his own clothes.  But I&#39;ve always felt he shouldn&#39;t be <br/>
forced; he&#39;ll do it when he&#39;s ready.  But since I pulled him out of <br/>
preschool this past October to homeschool, I ask if he wants to go <br/>
sit on the potty and he politely declines.  I still don&#39;t want to <br/>
force him, but I don&#39;t want him to be untrained at - oh, I don&#39;t <br/>
know, 14!  How do I impose my desire for him to potty train and be <br/>
true to the commitment I&#39;ve made to our family to unschool and try <br/>
to maintain that in every aspect of our life?<br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t want to wear a pull-up.  Do I just wait til it&#39;s warmer <br/>
and say, oh, sorry, we&#39;re out of diapers and let him figure out he <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to be wet?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if this is too pedantic. It probably links with some of the <br/>
other threads on control issues!<br/>

<br/>
-by the way, as a brand new homeschooler and unschooler, we had the <br/>
best day yesterday!  (My husband isn&#39;t convinced we accomplished <br/>
anything, but I am!)  I drug out all of the musical instruments we <br/>
have (sticks, play drum, triangles, you name it) and we <br/>
made &quot;music.&quot;  My 5 yr old son discovered reverberation and wanted <br/>
to see what made different vibrations.  It was awesome watching him <br/>
try different things.  The 3 yr old just danced and had a good time, <br/>
but Nate was really into investigating!  It was just one part of a <br/>
day without stress, deadlines and commitments.  I swear, the best <br/>
part of homeschooling is the whole rush to get out the door thing.  <br/>
It was awful!  The stress all of us had - my sons, me (and I&#39;m not a <br/>
morning person to begin with!).  My son would even look at the clock <br/>
in the car and say &quot;uh-oh it&#39;s 7:59, we&#39;re going to be late&quot;.  Why <br/>
on earth did I ever put him in a situation where he felt bad before <br/>
8 am in the morning?!?!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1487962110">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I am facing a current problem and would appreciate some insight.  My <br/>

<br/>
There is no &quot;egads&quot; - this is NOT late at all. This idea, even jokingly<br/>
expressed, that you might be a bad Mom for this has been installed by<br/>
Pre-school - see how insidious the school damage can be.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; How do I impose my desire for him to potty train and be <br/>
true to the commitment I&#39;ve made to our family to unschool and try <br/>
to maintain that in every aspect of our life? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t. <br/>
<br/>
The concept of &quot;impose&quot;, the prioritizing of your desire - especially in an<br/>
area that is so fundamentally and intensely part of his personal development<br/>
- is anathema to the Principles of Respect and Autonomy that are the heart<br/>
of Unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
I think there are a quite few hints in your post also that having<br/>
Unschooling as the foundation &quot;every aspect&quot; of your family life is still a<br/>
goal (a worthy one) rather than a place you have reached. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; He doesn&#39;t want to wear a pull-up.  Do I just wait til it&#39;s warmer <br/>
and say, oh, sorry, we&#39;re out of diapers and let him figure out he <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to be wet? &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This sounds very manipulative, especially if he is still comfortable with<br/>
diapers. <br/>
<br/>
You may have bought into the idea promoted by the diaper industry that<br/>
pull-ups are a necessary step in the road to potty training. Lots of people<br/>
on the lists report using them, but it seems that never for the &quot;advertised<br/>
purpose&quot; of &quot;encouraging&quot; (= forcing) potty training. <br/>
<br/>
Rather it was/is for the purpose of increasing and enhancing their<br/>
children&#39;s comfort and Ease in mostly public or sleeping situations. (An<br/>
unscientific survey based on my recollections!)<br/>
<br/>
We never used them at all.<br/>
<br/>
Here is Jayn&#39;s potty learning story, a repost from when she was 4 - she is<br/>
now 6:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Try and lose the word training from your thinking and you are well on<br/>
track. Also there are many and plenty of youngsters who are not seeming to<br/>
do anything until they are 4, then suddenly seem to learn it all overnight. <br/>
<br/>
Jayn is four and completely moved from cloth diapers to using the adult<br/>
commode all the time, from about 2 ½ to about 3 ½ (no dyedee at night)<br/>
absolutely painlessly without any effort from me. She began just as you are<br/>
describing (bar the flush action) [sitting on her potty and pretending to go<br/>
when I went]. <br/>
<br/>
Next she would use the potty before we went swimming through her swimsuit,<br/>
at my invitation. We were away from home at the time with my mother going<br/>
through an illness, so I was surprised that she wanted to start the process<br/>
 her life being disrupted and all. <br/>
<br/>
When we got home in to our apartment, I would ask her whether she wanted to<br/>
be without her diaper for a while. I would move the potty around the house<br/>
to whatever room we were in, and show her how to pour it out  usually she<br/>
asked me to do it anyway. She would tell me that she had poo-poo in her<br/>
butt and then run to her potty. I guess we would have about one accident<br/>
a week, or less. Slowly the potty moved from in any room to the hallway, and<br/>
finally the bathroom again. We used diapers when we went out, and then<br/>
started leaving them at home, but taking our potty in the car. She seemed to<br/>
go from needing the diapers to simply telling me she wanted to peepee very<br/>
quickly.<br/>
<br/>
We still used a diaper at night, and towards the end of that she would wake<br/>
up dry, and use her diaper when she awoke  giggling about it sometimes. I<br/>
started asking her whether she wanted a diaper or not, or taking it off<br/>
first thing, so she became used to going into the bathroom a little while<br/>
after waking. There was a brief period of confusion for her about whether<br/>
she had her panties or her diaper on  but this only lasted a few nights. We<br/>
used a couple of washable bedliners (rather than disposable) from Bed, Bath<br/>
and Beyond to protect our mattress. She has wet the bed once in the last<br/>
four or five months.<br/>
<br/>
What we did not use were pull ups (another invention of the disposable<br/>
diaper industry), rewards, punishments, or any other numerous strategies<br/>
from Potty train your child overnight! experts. She still announces her<br/>
intention to go to the bathroom, although less often. She refuses to use<br/>
small commodes, in the places where kid size ones are available  saying she<br/>
is a big girl now and will use the big potty. The only help she still<br/>
requires of me is wiping her butt  on the occasions where that is<br/>
necessary. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; It probably links with some of the other threads on control issues!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s great that you are seeing that link.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; The 3 yr old just danced and had a good time, <br/>
but Nate was really into investigating! &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Soon you will be able to let go of your need to make this distinction...soon<br/>
you will see that there is no &quot;just&quot; dancing - that the good time is just as<br/>
valid for learning as any kind of more academic looking &quot;investigating&quot;.<br/>
There is no lower age limit on investigating. There is no upper age limit on<br/>
&quot;just&quot; having a good time.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the journey.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1926578448">Three years old isn&#39;t even unusual for a boy to not use a toilet regularly.  I know it can seem like forever when you are changing diapers but he really will eventually want to use the toilet.  I don&#39;t know if you use disposable diapers.....some kids really have trouble with switching to toilet when they use those.  My advice would be to relax....it will happen.<br/>
