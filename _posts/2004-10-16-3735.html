<div id="ygrps-yiv-1326251394">&quot;&gt; Caroline (1.5) knows the alphabet because we sing it to her when <br/>
we<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; change her diaper.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No; she doesn&#39;t know the alphabet. She knows a fun song that rhymes. <br/>
Later it<br/>
will be relevant as to being the alphabet.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I completely agree with everything Michelle said, but I wanted to <br/>
add that besides the fact that she knows a fun song that rhymes, <br/>
(rather than the alphabet), she also knows that song because she was <br/>
ready.<br/>
I could have sung the alphabet song everyday to Jalen as a baby and <br/>
he would NOT have learned it at age 1.5. Every child is so <br/>
different....she learned the song by being exposed and because she <br/>
was ready to learn it.<br/>
Jalen didn&#39;t speak much at all until age 3, he didn&#39;t like being <br/>
sung to even as an infant, so singing any kind of song wasn&#39;t going <br/>
to happen regardless.:)<br/>
<br/>
Children DO pick up what they are surrounded by, to some degree, <br/>
that is true. Some will read at 3y.o., some at 12y.o.....when <br/>
they&#39;re 20y.o., will it matter one whit? Nope.<br/>
