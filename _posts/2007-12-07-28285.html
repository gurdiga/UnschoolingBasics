<div id="ygrps-yiv-1603049735"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I just want people new to unschooling to try to understand that we  did <br/>
 </span></blockquote>first leave all &quot;teacher-directed&quot; type of schooling entirely behind for  many <br/>
years before my kids started taking classes. Now they view the teacher as a  <br/>
resource person and themselves as responsible for their own learning. It is VERY  <br/>
different than most of my students who think that I, as their teacher, run <br/>
the  show. My teens are running their own show, they are the directors, and the  <br/>
teachers of any classes they take are thought of more as useful  technicians.<br/>

I just think that is such a much more empowered  approach to going to college <br/>
than anything I was led to expect.  &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Julian, who is 18, is now a Goddard College student. And still  unschooling.  <br/>
He&#39;s able to do this because Goddard is extremely  non-traditional, and <br/>
EVERYTHING comes from Julian. He has total flexibility and  options to switch gears <br/>
when he wants to, and he is loving it.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s interesting -- I went to Hampshire College, a non-traditional, hippy  <br/>
sorta place where everyone designs their own majors. And I adored it, and it  <br/>
ruined me for traditional education, which is one of the things that led me to  <br/>
unschooling. That said, for unschoolers who don&#39;t care about a regular  <br/>
residential program, I think Goddard is the place to be. Amazing program (and  <br/>
considerably more affordable than most other places.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-863896177">unschoolingbasicsAnd, in my DD&#39;s case, are thrilled to have her as a student. She takes initiative, pays attention to the schedule, checks in with the teacher when she needs something, proceeds on her own when she doesn&#39;t. I get many compliments (nice for the Mom :) ) and I get to explain to the teachers that it&#39;s really not so much me as years of her learning to be in charge of her own learning and time that result in a person who can do these things. <br/>
<br/>
These are online middle school-level classes she is taking, not college. But I think she&#39;ll be fine if she decides to go to college.<br/>
