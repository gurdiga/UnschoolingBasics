<div id="ygrps-yiv-2041768930">&lt;&lt;&lt;My name is Wendy and I am seeking to learn more about unschooling.  We<br/>
have a son who is 20 months old, and I have begun gathering information<br/>

that would fit in great with our family!&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Have you been to www.naturalchild.org ? Especially since your baby is so<br/>
young you may enjoy some of these articles.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;I try to read to our son often and I am always looking for ways to<br/>
enhance his experience of the world around him.  I am reading a book by<br/>
Baby Einstein called &quot;Great Minds Start Little&quot;, and it offers some<br/>
wonderful ideas, which I intend to implement in our home.  I think<br/>
learning starts, well, when they are babies!  After all, they are<br/>
absorbing everything. [snip]...So I&#39;m really interested in learning more<br/>
about unschooling, and particularly sharing ideas on how to nurture a<br/>
preschooler&#39;s development.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Just play with him sitting on the floor with plenty of colorful toys of<br/>
different shapes, textures and noises. Hang out on the grass outdoors. Let<br/>
him walk and follow him around. Keep him safe by putting your soft hand over<br/>
the sharp corner or piling the pillows below, rather than making him move<br/>
away or not letting him climb. <br/>
<br/>
Beware of programs pushing early academics. The supposed &quot;advantage&quot; doesn&#39;t<br/>
generally last. <br/>

<br/>
Mikey was very verbal, very early so I looked into pre-school <br/>
curricula, learning activities, etc. But I couldn&#39;t resist pushing a <br/>
little and he learned to push back and resist it like crazy. I know <br/>
other people who suggest activities and have kids who are thrilled <br/>
with it all, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary bad, just that you have <br/>
to watch feeling like it&#39;s important and therefore you need <br/>
to &#39;encourage&#39; a lot. Kids develop skills at different rates. If you <br/>
play with them tons, you see where they are and can feel comfortable <br/>
that it&#39;s the right place for them!<br/>

Preschool Homeschooling<br/>
Beverly S. Krueger <br/>
Eager to begin assisting their children down the path of life many <br/>
young parents schedule play dates, attend Mom and baby swim classes, <br/>
and busily start planning all the necessary activities to give their <br/>
baby a head start in life. At this early date they haven&#39;t yet <br/>
realized they are trying to speed their way to the moment when that <br/>
beloved child leaves their door for a life on their own. Yes, that&#39;s <br/>
a moment all parents want their children to achieve fully prepared <br/>
for the vagaries of life, but the closer you get to that moment the <br/>
more time you wish you had. By the time your child is sixteen, you <br/>
find them running willy nilly towards that goal themselves just when <br/>
you&#39;re ready to relax and take it a little slower. <br/>
<br/>
With children ages five through sixteen, I&#39;ve been through the new <br/>
parent &quot;over achieve for my child&quot; period and now face the &quot;my baby <br/>
is going to be leaving soon&quot; period. It&#39;s mingled heart ache and joy. <br/>
The way I deal with my younger children is also greatly affected by <br/>
this new life stage. I&#39;ve started slowing down with them already. <br/>
Rather than push them on to new achievements ahead of the pack, I&#39;m <br/>
giving them more time to be the age they are. Rachel needs plenty of <br/>
time to play house, sing to her dollies, color, dress up, and create <br/>
play dough buffets. She&#39;ll give up all these activities soon enough, <br/>
but the timing will be her own, not because I have pushed her into <br/>
more &quot;educational&quot; activities.<br/>
<br/>
The concept &quot;educational&quot; activity is in itself restricting. <br/>
Somewhere along the way we have lost the understanding that the <br/>
activities commonly known as &quot;school&quot; are only one form of <br/>
educational activity. Learning to read, write, and do arithmetic have <br/>
been elevated to such a high plane that the other forms of learning <br/>
are pushed to the side as unworthy of much dedicated time. In the <br/>
past preschoolers were not expected to learn to read, and yet today I <br/>
receive many requests for help in choosing a reading program for <br/>
three or four-year-olds. I&#39;m assured that the child is more than <br/>
ready to take this next step in his educational program. That may <br/>
well be, but my response is so what? Assuredly you can start a <br/>
reading program that requires only 10 minutes a day, and that really <br/>
isn&#39;t a great chunk of time to whittle out of the child&#39;s daily <br/>
schedule. But most people that insist on starting their preschooler <br/>
reading are also working on math, doing science experiments, and <br/>
finding all kinds of ways to jumpstart academics. All <br/>
this &quot;educational&quot; activity pushes aside the things that a child <br/>
should be doing, playing, exploring and discovering life on their own.<br/>
<br/>
Most parents would be horrified to realize that they may be <br/>
unintentionally quashing their child&#39;s creative abilities by <br/>
constantly employing them in directed activities. They teach them to <br/>
color in the lines rather than give them art supplies to use as they <br/>
decide. Rather than letting them discover ants on their own, they <br/>
take them outside for a complete lecture on ants. By the age of two, <br/>
they schedule regular dates for their children to play with those <br/>
their own age ignoring the fact that two-year-olds don&#39;t yet play <br/>
socially. They tie up all their time in planned activities and events <br/>
never allowing children the freedom to discover on their own. <br/>
Creativity needs room to experiment. If children have no room to do <br/>
their own thing, they will gradually stop thinking in creative ways <br/>
and look only for the &quot;correct&quot; or &quot;proper&quot; way to do something. They <br/>
will turn to their authority, the parent, to tell them what they <br/>
should do. Later in life they will turn to other authorities.<br/>
<br/>
Admittedly the over-achieving parent I&#39;ve described is not the norm. <br/>
But most of us would recognize those traits in ourselves to one <br/>
degree or another. If you&#39;re naturally given to a relaxed mode of <br/>
life, don&#39;t pat yourself on the back too hard. Everyone has flaws, <br/>
it&#39;s just the organizers in life that fall prey to this need to <br/>
organize their children&#39;s lives to the nth degree. <br/>
<br/>
So what should an over-achieving parent do besides sitting on their <br/>
hands and screeching occasionally? Organize their children&#39;s things. <br/>
No, I don&#39;t mean sort out their closets. I mean actively plan what <br/>
things you will place in your child&#39;s environment. Surround your <br/>
child with the tools for creative play: blocks, puzzles, dress up <br/>
clothes, dolls, cars, trucks, toy dishes, stoves, sinks, and brooms. <br/>
Be discerning in the toys you select. Are they toys that stimulate <br/>
imaginative play? Avoid electronic toys. Have bins of art supplies, <br/>
science supplies, and craft supplies that children can access and use <br/>
as they desire. If you have room, provide a stack of planks, bricks <br/>
and boxes for outdoor construction projects. Let your children raid <br/>
the linen closet to create their own tents with the dining room <br/>
table. Help them string a clothesline to hang curtains for stage <br/>
productions. Provide plenty of music tapes and an easy to use tape <br/>
recorder. Children will use these tools to build on daily experiences <br/>
and those special occasions when they make a visit to the zoo, <br/>
museum, or children&#39;s show. The day after their big sister&#39;s car wash <br/>
you may find them outside pretending to run their own car wash for <br/>
all the tricycles in the neighborhood. A visit to the zoo might spark <br/>
the creation of their own jungle room using their stuffed animals.<br/>
<br/>
Allow children plenty of time to do their own thing. Turn them loose <br/>
in the back yard to dig, poke and pry keeping an eye on them from a <br/>
distance. I promise when some momentous discovery is made they will <br/>
come charging back to you to share it. As much fun as it is spending <br/>
time doing things with your children, it is equally fun to watch them <br/>
busy at their own tasks. Surreptitiously observing your children will <br/>
give you priceless memories of inquisitive faces determining that <br/>
water runs down hill if you dump your pail out on a sloping yard. <br/>
That hands on experience and many others will later confirm the <br/>
concept of gravity when they are older.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t let what I have said cause you to react too far in the other <br/>
direction and avoid doing things with and for your child. Many things <br/>
that children learn are learned by observing and following another&#39;s <br/>
example. When you&#39;re baking include your children. When you&#39;re <br/>
folding laundry let them help. Suggest that your daughter get out her <br/>
ironing board and iron while you iron, too. Give your son a patch of <br/>
ground to grow his own flowers from seed, showing him how to cover <br/>
each seed with just the right amount of soil and then gently sprinkle <br/>
them with water. The daily flow of life in a household is another of <br/>
the &quot;educational&quot; arenas that is forgotten in today&#39;s society. <br/>
Playing house is one of a preschool child&#39;s delights. It gives them <br/>
the opportunity to practice all the tasks they have seen their <br/>
parents and older siblings do each day. Although they may not <br/>
accomplish a task as perfectly as you desire, their unabashed <br/>
enthusiasm for housework will never be greater than at this age. <br/>
Letting them help you will teach them far more than you imagine. <br/>
They&#39;ll be improving their large motor skills, learn to discern <br/>
subtle differences (this window is clean, this window has streaks), <br/>
and learn to order tasks properly. All these things will help them <br/>
later when they do finally learn to read.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t rush your child through their childhood because you think you <br/>
are giving them a head start on achieving great things. Academics <br/>
have their place in a child&#39;s education, but they shouldn&#39;t be <br/>
allowed to force out the other important learning that a child needs <br/>
to do. As parents we want so much for our children that sometimes we <br/>
push them when it&#39;s better to let them grow at their own pace. The <br/>
key is to relax. Relax, that&#39;s a word that you will hear throughout <br/>
your homeschooling career. Even after many years of homeschooling and <br/>
parenting I still find myself needing to be reminded to relax <br/>
occasionally. It&#39;s hard to imagine now at the outset of your journey <br/>
just how much you will miss the times when your children came <br/>
trouping out in oversized shoes and clothes to invite you to a tea <br/>
party in their room. Revel in this time. The future holds equally <br/>
wonderful treasures, but they will be different treasures.<br/>

Brock Magiscope Technically not a preschool item, but due to cost <br/>
something you should consider saving for. This is the most durable <br/>
and usable microscope available for children. This scope is <br/>
constructed of solid aluminum alloy and tempered brass, with no <br/>
exposed threads, knobs, gears, or screws. Focusing is simple brass on <br/>
brass friction, requiring no grease or maintenance. The entire <br/>
microscope has one moving part. It requires no lamps, cords or <br/>
batteries. It&#39;s not something you&#39;ll hand your two year old, but a <br/>
four year old could spend a lot of time using it after proper <br/>
instruction. Model #70 with 20x magnification is $159. Brock Optical <br/>
Inc. 1-800-780-9111 <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi, Wendy!<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the list.  I&#39;m Tracy and my DH and I have two children:  <br/>
Aydn is 5yo and Fiona is 3yo.  When Aydn was a little guy we bought all <br/>
the Baby Einstein videos/DVDs and some of the toys.  It was fun for ME <br/>
to gather them and imagine all the fun and learning that we&#39;d have <br/>
together &quot;some day&quot;.  In hindsight, the reality was that we could have <br/>
fun every day and that he&#39;d learn naturally just by living.  I didn&#39;t <br/>
need to have an agenda for him at all!  LOL  We still have all the <br/>
stuff but the kids aren&#39;t really interested in it at all.  I hesitate <br/>
to pass it along to friends with younger kids in case they want to also <br/>
do what I thought I *should* do with them.  Did you follow that <br/>
sentence?  hehehe<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the quote from you (above) I wanted to address.  &quot;we&#39;re working <br/>
on helping him grow<br/>
more independent, without pushing him&quot;  He&#39;s only 20 months, right?  <br/>
He&#39;s *supposed to be* dependent on you now.  He&#39;s got YEARS to learn <br/>
how to be INdependent -- right around the time that you want him to <br/>
stay little and be your little boy is the time he&#39;ll be striking out on <br/>
his own more often.  Savor the cuddles, and lap time, and nursing, and <br/>
kisses, and try not to be too eager for him to not need you as much.  <br/>
My eldest child is only just 5 and every time he outgrows a shirt or a <br/>
shoe I get a little melancholy and sentimental and wish there was a <br/>
switch I could throw that would keep him from getting any bigger.  I <br/>
want to  s t r e t c h  out my time to really &quot;mother&quot; him.  KWIM?  I <br/>
don&#39;t want it to end!  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Hug your little boy and just enjoy him as he is today ... don&#39;t spend <br/>
too much time planning for a day that may not even pan out the way you <br/>
envisioned.<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>

Hi, Wendy---and welcome!<br/>
 <br/>
You&#39;ll find all of us here a tad bit biased! &lt;G&gt; We&#39;ll tell you to  drop the <br/>
curriculum ideas and focus on the fun!<br/>
 <br/>
Below is sometihing I send to unschooling inquiries that come to me in SC.  <br/>
I&#39;ve sent it here before. It might help you find some answers.<br/>
 <br/>
~Kelly<br/>
 <br/>
   <br/>
Unschooling Basics<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is trusting the  child to learn what he needs to learn when he<br/>
needs to learn it. Unschooling  is also sometimes called &quot;natural learning&quot; <br/>
and<br/>
&quot;child-led learning&quot; . But  mostly unschooling is NOT school-at home: we do <br/>
not<br/>
try to replicate school  in our houses. It&#39;s real living in the real<br/>
world---for and with a purpose.  You cannot live and not learn---we&#39;re <br/>
surrounded by real opportunities every day  to learn. And it&#39;s REAL learning, not <br/>
simulated as in<br/>
school. Living is  learning is unschooling is living is learning  is<br/>
unschooling.....<br/>
<br/>
There are several good books on the inanity and  insanity of schools and on<br/>
the marvels of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
The unschooling  &quot;patron saint&quot; is John Holt. He was a school reformer in the<br/>
70&#39;s who came to  realize that schools are NOT reformable. His most popular<br/>
books are How  Children Fail, How Children Learn, Teach Your Own, and Learning<br/>
All the  Time.<br/>
<br/>
John Taylor Gatto was a NY city and NY state teacher of the year.  He finally<br/>
quit and started on the speaking circuit. He seems completely  behind<br/>
unschooling. His two big books are Dumbing Us Down and The Underground  <br/>
History<br/>
of American Education.<br/>
<br/>
Frank Smith has a great little book  called The Book of Learning and<br/>
Forgetting that shows how little one learns  in and remembers from school. He<br/>
pushes REAL learning---for a  purpose.<br/>
<br/>
Alfie Kohn&#39;s Punished by Rewards shows the total inanity of  EXtrinsic<br/>
motivation (gold stars, grades, etc.) and the attributes of  INtrinsic<br/>
motivation.<br/>
<br/>
Grace Llewellyn&#39;s The Teenage Liberation  Handbook (How to Quit School and<br/>
Get a REAL Education) is the &quot;bible&quot; for  unschoolers. It&#39;s a great read for<br/>
teens, but parents should read it too. Be  SURE not to skip the &quot;cute little<br/>
story&quot; at the beginning. Grace also hosts  the &quot;Not Back To School Camp&quot; in <br/>
the early<br/>
fall for teen unschoolers---a  place to meet other unschoolers and share<br/>
passions and interests.<br/>
<br/>
Mary  Griffith has two books, The Homeschooling Handbook and The  Unschooling<br/>
Handbook. The Homeschooling Handbook has many great ideas for  documenting<br/>
what&#39;s being learned; and, since that is a requirement in SC,  it&#39;s very <br/>
helpful.<br/>
But The Unschooling Handbook is THE handbook for new  unschoolers. In it she<br/>
gives real life examples and explanations. VERY  understandable. Convinced my<br/>
husband that what I was suggesting made sense!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
David Albert has two: And the Skylark Sings with Me and  Homeschooling and the<br/>
Voyage of Self-Discovery. Both are witty---and easy  reads.<br/>

Valerie Fitzenreiter has a brand new book that I highly recommend:  The<br/>
Unprocessed Child: Living Without School. It&#39;s about unschooling her  <br/>
daughter,<br/>
Laurie. I give it as gifts a LOT!<br/>
 <br/>
Magazines:<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Life Learning Magazine&quot; <br/>
&quot;Growing Without Schooling&quot;, originally  put out by John Holt. No longer in <br/>
production, but back issues available from  &quot;old&quot; unschoolers and from FUNbooks.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Websites:<br/>
<br/>
_www.unschooling.com_ (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unschooling.com/)">http://www.unschooling.com/)</a>  is THE website  for <br/>
unschooling. There are other lists<br/>
that &quot;say&quot; they unschool; these are  the radicals who KNOW what they are <br/>
talking<br/>
about. There are essays and FAQs  which you should definitely read first.<br/>
Afterwards go to the message boards  and read, read, READ! If you have <br/>
questions<br/>
after reading for a few weeks,  then post---but most things have been <br/>
explained<br/>
before, so if you read,  you&#39;ll run across the answers to most of your<br/>
questions.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The posters to pay attention to are Sandra Dodd,  Joyce Fetteroll, Pam<br/>
Sorooshian, Anne Ohman, Lyle, and Mary Gold. There are  other wonderful <br/>
posters, but<br/>
these are all radical unschoolers who all have  great ways of expressing <br/>
themselves and getting to the nitty gritty of  unschooling. They will all be at the<br/>
conference in August.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:_UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com">_UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>_ <br/>
(mailto:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>)  is  a great e-list if you prefer your messages in mail form, but <br/>
the traffic is  HIGH. 200-400/day on the Discussion list. Unless you&#39;re hard <br/>
core, or just  prefer your lists this way, I&#39;d recommend the message boards.<br/>
 <br/>
There is also <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:_UnschoolingBasics@yahoogroups.com">_UnschoolingBasics@yahoogroups.com</a>_ <br/>
(mailto:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:UnschoolingBasics@yahoogroups.com">UnschoolingBasics@yahoogroups.com</a>) .  For beginners.<br/>
<br/>
_www.SchoolsOutSupport.org_ (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.schoolsoutsupport.org/)">http://www.schoolsoutsupport.org/)</a>  is the SC  <br/>
unschooling support group. Membership is<br/>
free. It has a message board and  info about laws and local groups. It hosts<br/>
the unschooling conference in  August.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra Dodd is a radical unschooler of three children, 16, 14,  & 12 (I<br/>
think). She has her own website that is chocked FULL of essays  and stories <br/>
about<br/>
unschooling. It&#39;s a great place to start. _www.SandraDodd.com/unschooling_ <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sandradodd.com/unschooling)">http://www.sandradodd.com/unschooling)</a>   She<br/>
is also the keynote speaker at the August conference.<br/>
<br/>
Ned  Vare & Luz Shosie have  an<br/>
already-graduated-from-college-always-unschooled son. Their website is  full <br/>
of<br/>
short essays on unschooling. They have a<br/>
newsletter as well. <br/>

books and games. _www.FUN-Books.com_ (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.fun-books.com/)">http://www.fun-books.com/)</a>     <br/>

School&#39;s Out Support&#39;s  Live & Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>

<br/>
This conference is a must attend!  Meet other families on the same journey,<br/>
listen to inspiring speakers, and  discover the art of unschooling in <br/>
beautiful<br/>
downtown Columbia, SC. This is a  non-age-discriminatory conference: anyone <br/>
can<br/>
participate in any Funshop or  Presentation. Bring the whole family for a<br/>
joy-filled  weekend!<br/>
<br/>
School&#39;s Out Support (SOS) is a volunteer-driven, statewide  organization<br/>
whose mission is to support and promote unschooling, provide  information,<br/>
monitor and influence legislation, offer opportunities for  families to get <br/>
together,<br/>
and empower families to make the choices that  respect the rights, needs and<br/>
aspirations of their children. SOS welcomes  anyone with an interest in<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Since its inception in April  2001, SOS has supported families that have made<br/>
the decision to unschool as  they face difficult questions and challenges.<br/>
These families may wonder about  socialization, the legal issues surrounding<br/>
unschooling, accountability  associations, or integration of John Holt&#39;s<br/>
educational philosophy into their  everyday lives. Some families may doubt <br/>
their abilities, feel confused and ask  themselves, &quot;Can I really do this?&quot;. SOS <br/>
encourages<br/>
parents to trust  themselves and their children to make good decisions and<br/>
empowers them to  find the support and information they need.<br/>
<br/>
Our Presenters<br/>
For our  Keynote presenter we are very fortunate to have the popular<br/>
contributor to  Unschooling.com message boards, its e-list, AlwaysLearning, <br/>
and<br/>
regular  columnist in HEM---unschooling guru, Sandra Dodd. A former middle  <br/>
school<br/>
teacher, Sandra has talked countless families into running away from  school <br/>
and<br/>
jumping into learning for fun. Her motto: &quot;Everything  Counts!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re also delighted to have Anne Ohman, from the  Unschooling.com message<br/>
boards, back for a return engagement. She &quot;stole the  show&quot; last year with her<br/>
debut and is now in demand at conferences all over  the country. AnneO&#39;s<br/>
passionate, gentle approach to life and learning  continues to inspire <br/>
families<br/>
daily.<br/>
<br/>
Pam Sorooshian is well known in  &quot;all the unschooling<br/>
circles&quot;---Unschooling.com&#39;s message boards, the  unschoolingdotcom e-list,<br/>
AlwaysLearning, NHEN, and<br/>
the California boards.  When she&#39;s not teaching college level economics and<br/>
statistics, Pam&#39;s an  unschooling mom of three teenagers: she&#39;s &quot;been there, <br/>
done<br/>
<br/>
that&quot;---and  will surely have a few answers for you!<br/>
<br/>
Mary Gold is better known as  &quot;Zenmomma&quot;--and you can find her wherever<br/>
unschooling is a topic! Mary  &quot;preaches&quot; peace and trust and joy---and the <br/>
pure<br/>
delight of unschooling her  children. Her encouraging words are music to a<br/>
stressed<br/>
parent&#39;s  ears---and she always leaves you knowing that &quot;Life is good!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Jim Weiss&#39;  storytelling has captivated and delighted both adults and children<br/>
with his  original stories and retellings of classics. To hear him tell a<br/>
story is to  be swept into another world. Jim&#39;s award-winning tapes are <br/>
favorites<br/>
<br/>
in  many homes---including ours!<br/>

You  may also all me anytime to ask questions or discuss concerns. I truly<br/>
believe  that school is harmful---physically, emotionally, intellectually,  <br/>
and<br/>
spiritually. It&#39;s a bad place to spend a childhood.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-490447993">I know this is kind of OT from specifically unschooling, but we all<br/>
read and lots of people like to share what they read so I&#39;ve started a<br/>
google group sharing links to websites about reading and reviews of<br/>
books that members have read. I&#39;ve just started it so I have 0<br/>
members, but if anyone is interested in joining you can check it out here:<br/>

I hope that is the right link anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I know I haven&#39;t posted on this board for eons but I have been so busy<br/>
trying to get my website off the ground that I just haven&#39;t had time<br/>
for anything else! I am also discovering all the wonderful things that<br/>
google has to offer for FREE! If you have a web-based business and<br/>
want to know more about google stuff email me.<br/>

Thanks for looking at my group!<br/>
