<div id="ygrps-yiv-2123749828">Hi, My name is Katie and I am a stay at home mama to Mabel who is 7 <br/>
months.  We are fully an AP family.  We live in Denver, Colorado. <br/>
(if anyone else is close by, :o))  Mabel is very active and started <br/>
crawling backwards at 5 months and forward at 6.  Sounds like Emma.  <br/>
I am already seeing her start to stay up later and later cause she <br/>
wants to practice standing up.  I am glad I am here to learn about <br/>
how to accept these challenges as they arise.  I am in the process <br/>
of figuring out whether I have what it takes to homeschool.  This <br/>
whole philosophy of unschooling is very new to me.  It sounds very <br/>
interesting and effective.  I have to constantly remind myself of my <br/>
own reactions to being forced to do things and how that has created <br/>
a resistance to this day.  I am having a hard time grasping how you <br/>
raise your kids into polite, respectful adults without any control.  <br/>
<br/>
My question is...  how would you teach them to say please and thank <br/>
you?  Or to clear their plate and help out when a guest at someone&#39;s <br/>
home?  How do you teach them to help around the house?  Will they <br/>
naturally wish to do these things?  I know kids are eager to <br/>
participate and have a huge amount of desire to do nice things on <br/>
their own, so maybe that is the idea.  It&#39;s just so vastly different <br/>
than our entire society has been trained to think.  I&#39;d like to know <br/>
how you give them structure in this type of environment.  I know I <br/>
needed structure growing up.  I needed daily routines and rituals.  <br/>
I loved that we ate dinner together at almost the same time every <br/>
night.  I loved that my dad tucked me into bed and said the same <br/>
prayers to me.  I think stability is important too.  I&#39;m wondering <br/>
how you set all this up while still letting your children be free.  <br/>
Are there any family rules?  Any rules at all?  For example, do you <br/>
let your kid go out of the house in the snow without a coat or <br/>
sweater just cause they feel like it?    <br/>
<br/>
I really do think this sounds like an awesome way to parent and am <br/>
so eager to learn more.  Thanks in advance for taking the time to <br/>
explain it to me.<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1149032620">Hi, Katie!  <br/>
 <br/>
Nice to *meet* you ... I have four children -- Jessica is married to a soldier, a junior at Baylor and 21, Michael 18, David 15, Robert 13.  <br/>
 <br/>
The BEST way to teach them anything, especially at younger ages, was to model the behaviors I wanted -- and very actively encouraging them to do the same!  My kids were assuredly not the best behaved at home, but I always heard from others -- whether the kids were guests at another home, or interacting at volunteer events, or otherwise in public setting -- how well-mannered, polite and helpful they were.<br/>
 <br/>
Living where I do -- Waco -- I struggle daiy with *adult* attitudes that kids are not worth respect -- and have, in fact, had some awesome battles with one administrator in particular, and a few teachers, over treating kids as they, the teachers, expect to be treated -- with respect!  And no, they don&#39;t need to say *ma&#39;am* and *sir* to be respectful to adults, not by a long shot, and I refuse to make them!  Which does little to endear me to some folks, but ... when my kids meet MY expectations, and I hear so much good feedback, I know I&#39;m doing the right thing.<br/>
 <br/>
As for learning chores, that&#39;s something else I modelled -- we did them together at first, and then I&#39;d ask them to chose from a short list ... and the key I think is not being too fussy over perfection!  They will do their best, and that improves with time and practice, and I would always be there to help if a chore got too overwhelming, so they learned that sometimes things just need to be done, but we can work together to accomplish a task.  We also swap chores, too -- even today -- so no one gets stuck with a *nasty* one all the time, and I even let them negotiate with each other.  My daughter despised doing the kitchen floor, so she&#39;s often trade with one of her brothers, or would even pay one of them!  As long as they both agreed, no problem.<br/>
 <br/>
Their &quot;structure&quot; is the security and love you provide -- knowing you are there, and you love them, and that you are interested in them.  That&#39;s all it&#39;s taken in our house, and I am SO proud of how mine are turning out.  Of course, there ARE rules, but where possible, I look for the *yes* rather than the *no* in a given situation ... for example, a kid who refused to get dressed for kindergarten ... well, when told he HAD to go, he chose to go in his pj&#39;s ... no problem for me, but HE didn&#39;t like being the center of attention that day, and it didn&#39;t happen again.  <br/>
 <br/>
You KNOW what&#39;s best for your child -- trust your instincts.  And ask for help ... something important to learn and do -- it&#39;s never wrong to ask for feedback or suggestions, as long as you treat that info as such, and use what is helpful.<br/>
 <br/>
Best to you and yours,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-608747505">Hi Katie. Welcome. I&#39;m fairly new here too.<br/>
<br/>
I do wish I had all the answers, but all I  can share is what I plan to <br/>
do, and what I hope the results will be, because my DD is only 15 months <br/>
old.<br/>
<br/>
Manners are very important to me. It&#39;s important to me that my daughter <br/>
treat people respectfully and politely. But I do not like the ways in <br/>
which other families I know teach manners. Too coercive and punitive for <br/>
my taste. I feel that if DD sees that DH and I always say please and <br/>
thank you to each other, that she will just &quot;absorb&quot; that this is the <br/>
way things are done.<br/>
<br/>
I think my FIL&#39;s way of teaching her manners is confusing because when <br/>
he gives her something he coaches her to say thank you. So why is HE <br/>
saying thank you when he is the one giving her something? I would much <br/>
rather he just give her things and not say anything. If she were to give <br/>
HIM something, then it would make sense for him to say thank you. KWIM? <br/>
She already says, &quot;TUH!&quot; loudly and happily sometimes when I give her <br/>
something that she wants. Maybe she&#39;s trying to say thank you already? <br/>
Wishful thinking on my part? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
DD is very interested already in sharing and helping. I just lucked out. <br/>
She is VERY young for exhibiting these sorts of behavior and I cannot <br/>
take any credit for it. It&#39;s just how she is. If I open the refrigerator <br/>
or dishwasher she is over there like a shot to help me close them up <br/>
again. After she has helped me push them closed I always thank her. She <br/>
LOVES to help, and I am going to try to nurture that in her. Kids are <br/>
like dogs in some ways (please don&#39;t flame me, hear me out!) in that <br/>
they love to have a job, and all they need as a reward IMO is to be told <br/>
that they did a good job, they don&#39;t need food or a toy as a reward. <br/>
Just my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
If she is eating something, she will occasionally feed me some. <br/>
Sometimes this means that she is full and doesn&#39;t want to eat any more, <br/>
but not always. I always eat whatever it is (goldfish cracker, grape, <br/>
what have you) and say thank you. Or if I REALLY don&#39;t want to eat it, <br/>
lol, I still take it from her and thank her.<br/>
<br/>
As far as helping goes, I can&#39;t stand the way some parents (my own <br/>
included) do EVERYTHING for their child, like cooking, laundry, <br/>
cleaning, etc. and then at 18 they shove them out into the world and <br/>
expect them to know what to do. I would much rather have been included <br/>
in those activities when I was younger than have to figure it out in <br/>
college, lol. I bet my mom could have used the help too, but she just <br/>
couldn&#39;t get over that initial stage where I wasn&#39;t doing things right <br/>
yet. Short fuse I guess.<br/>
<br/>
I plan to let DD make messes and do the best she can without making a <br/>
big deal about it. She&#39;ll learn by doing instead of being told, &quot;You&#39;re <br/>
not doing it right, give it to me, I&#39;ll do it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s still an experiment for us, we&#39;ll keep everyone posted on how it <br/>
goes. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get some great advice from moms of older kids here.<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2146410999">Hi Katie! An answer to one of your questions:<br/>
<br/>
For example, do you <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; let your kid go out of the house in the snow without a coat or <br/>
&gt; sweater just cause they feel like it?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is going to be some point in Mabels life when she is going to <br/>
think for herself, and she is going to think that she CAN go out in <br/>
the snow without her coat!  This usually happens around the age of 2 <br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
Anyway, you could handle the situation with, no, you HAVE to wear a <br/>
coat and your daughter is going to think, but i&#39;m a big girl now(cuz <br/>
she&#39;s 2!) and I DON&#39;T HAVE to wear a coat!  Or, you could let her <br/>
know its snowing and very cold and that it would be a good idea to <br/>
wear one,that you are wearing one to keep warm and be comfortable and <br/>
safe, and let her decide.  This is, of course, in hopes that she goes <br/>
out doors (only temporary, I don&#39;t mean it to come across as letting <br/>
her play for an hour without one! ) anyway, in hopes that she goes <br/>
out and feels the cold air and thinks to herself, I need a coat.  Of <br/>
course it might not ever go as easy as it is said, but you get the <br/>
idea?  Kinda like defusing the power struggle before it even starts.  <br/>
She&#39;ll learn that she can think for herself which will just spill <br/>
over into all the other aspects of her life!<br/>
  As for manners.  My boys, 6 and 11, have been unschooled now for <br/>
one year.  They were in public school before this.  And when they <br/>
were in school, there was stress.  When we went to the grocery store <br/>
together, there was MAJOR stress.  Now, things are SO much more <br/>
relaxed, and at the grocery store, they get complimented on being <br/>
such good helpers or for helping me so much!  And to think i&#39;m not <br/>
even carrying a switch thru the store with me making them be that <br/>
way, thats just the way they are!!!!  They are being raised around <br/>
adults with manners instead of a room full of kids that may or may <br/>
not have manners.  They get treated with respect, which in turn  has <br/>
taught them to treat mom  and dad and others with respect.  It is <br/>
absolutly wonderful!  We have no rules here, I don&#39;t think.  We <br/>
definatly have no set sceduale, but we do watch movies every saturday <br/>
night with each other with lots of popcorn, and we do read every <br/>
single night before bed, becuz thats what they want to do.  I think <br/>
and I know I&#39;ve read on Sandra&#39;s writings that stress can really <br/>
cause alot of problems in kids.  So I just try to keep their life as <br/>
stress free for now as possible.  <br/>
Syndi---I was reading some pages of sandras today that i had never <br/>
found before, i&#39;ll get them and post asap.  You&#39;ll really enjoy them <br/>
I think and it will help put all your questions into perspective! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-794533971">Hi Katie,<br/>
<br/>
&lt; For example, do you let your kid go out of the house<br/>

<br/>
Well. this doesn&#39;t come up too often since we live in<br/>
Tucson Arizona LOL, but we did go play in the snow<br/>
while on vacation when my dd, Sierra, was younger. <br/>
Maybe she was 3?  She played in the snow without<br/>
shoes.  My parents (as usual) were horrified.  I<br/>
cringed, thinking about how I would feel in the snow<br/>
without shoes.  But Sierra had a blast.  <br/>
<br/>
She does occasionally wear shoes now.  But is barefoot<br/>
most of the time.  Yes, even in the desert!  Often at<br/>
the park, other kids want to take off their shoes when<br/>
they see her barefoot, but the parents usually say NO<br/>
- it&#39;s too hot, you&#39;ll step on a thorn, glass, ant,<br/>
snake, ...[fill in the blank].  It helped me to find a<br/>
website encouraging barefoot children -<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-771645241">Hi Katie,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Some here might be chuckling at me jumping in with &quot;advice&quot; (although I<br/>
would hesitate to call it that) since I am also new to this, but here is my<br/>
take:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The biggest challenge for me is to delete everything I was told by my<br/>
parents about what my abilities were as a child. Because they have coloured<br/>
my belief in myself as an adult and my beliefs in my kids (I can say kids<br/>
now as I am less than 2 months from having the second:-)). So I started (and<br/>
still do) by questioning every single &quot;no&quot; I wanted to say to my daughter. I<br/>
was trying to find the source and motivation for that answer. Once I know<br/>
that then it helps me to know if my answer is respectful (would it feel that<br/>
way to me or not) and will it have the desired effect. Now I know my<br/>
daughter and she like to do opposite of what ever I tell her, and has a hard<br/>
time distinguishing between suggestions and orders, so it has been a bit of<br/>
work that is for sure. But that was my start. I totally believe that you get<br/>
what you give in this world, especially with kids. And so if you act<br/>
respectful you will get respect (maybe not in that minute, but hey then it<br/>
didn&#39;t take me a minute to learn it either). And I see it. When I am tired<br/>
and short and impatient and snap at my daughter that is exactly what I get<br/>
back and then for some reason I find *her* tone of voice to be less than<br/>
respectful. What about mine?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Two examples that come to mind: My dh is really having a hard time with our<br/>
dd interrupting us when we are talking. I swear she has some sort of beacon<br/>
on that says &quot;oh they are talking, now I have to interrupt&quot;, even though she<br/>
actually often doesn&#39;t have anything to say. What I noticed though, is how<br/>
often HE interrupts her! He thinks she is done, or has gone on for too long,<br/>
or is not listening or what ever and just starts talking over her. Well<br/>
where did she learn this? Today I told him to have faith she will learn this<br/>
and he said &quot;maybe!&quot; and I said &quot;yup you are right, you never learned it so<br/>
maybe she won&#39;t either&quot;. So I can see that I have to start doing the same<br/>
with both of them and setting the example and remind them both to not<br/>
interrupt. The other is my SIL who complains all the time that her two boys<br/>
don&#39;t respect her but she never shows them any respect and she gets right<br/>
back what she gives. She thinks this is some hookey new age parenting and<br/>
that she should get respect just because she is the parent, I say she is in<br/>
for a rude awakening:-)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
On to the other things in your post:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Please and thank you. My dd, is the most polite kid I know. and we have<br/>
never forced it. We remind sometimes, although I don&#39;t even like doing that,<br/>
but she uses please and thank you a lot. Why? Because we modeled it to her.<br/>
My dh always thanks me for dinner and then gets up and cleans up afterwards.<br/>
So she thanks me for dinner each night now too.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
By clear their plate, I think you mean moving it to the sink? Well I ask her<br/>
to bring me her plate. She does sometimes. she doesn&#39;t others times. The<br/>
times she does I thank her for her help the times she doesn&#39;t I go get it<br/>
and that is it.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
She loves housecleaning (don&#39;t ask me where she gets this from) but I find<br/>
her in her little apron with her duster in the living room tsk tsking<br/>
because it is dusty. LOL. so I follow her lead and help HER do the cleaning<br/>
that day. We plan days when we are going to do it. We have cleaners in once<br/>
a month or so, she grabs her tools and wonders around the house helping them<br/>
out. Some kids want to, I bet some don&#39;t. Not sure that forcing them will<br/>
cause them to be cleaner/tidier people when they live on their own. They<br/>
will be how they be and then when they find the motivator to change they<br/>
will. But motivation has to come from and internal source, not external.<br/>
(wow my college diploma just came in handy!)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Oh the coat thing. what we do is take one along &quot;just in case&quot;, she never<br/>
has to wear it but it is there. Often now she will ask me to bring along a<br/>
coat or shoes &quot;just in case&quot;. Yesterday we headed out to our local<br/>
exhibition for the day. Left in the afternoon and knew we would be away into<br/>
the evening. So even though she had a long sleeve sweater on, I suggested a<br/>
coat, just in case. She said no. Ok... we didn&#39;t take one for her. By 9, she<br/>
wanted something on her, well I had a blanket so she bundled in the stroller<br/>
in that. Then as she was going onto the ferris wheel with her dad I said to<br/>
take the blanket as it would be cool up there. He was surprised at the<br/>
suggestion and I said, well we don&#39;t have a coat for her. She said next time<br/>
she would bring a coat that she was sorry she didn&#39;t let me bring a &quot;just in<br/>
case coat&quot;. In this instance, I didn&#39;t force her to take along the coat, but<br/>
had something else for her I assumed one of us would need. AND at the end of<br/>
it, she realized that she might want one when she is going to be gone for a<br/>
long time without me having to force a rule down her throat or any sacrifice<br/>
of herself. All good:-)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
A lot of people confuse structure. We don&#39;t have a lot of rules anymore. but<br/>
we offer lots of structure in our every day life. We get up every morning<br/>
and eat breakfast. We talk about the day and plan what we are going to do.<br/>
Some days we are home some days we are out. My dh works from home so he is<br/>
here lots and that can cause plans to change. We always eat lunch and dinner<br/>
is most always together (this will differ from others here, but it isn&#39;t a<br/>
battle for us and we love it), then we have bed time and it is over. So I<br/>
think we have routine and Hannah gets her structure in knowing she is in a<br/>
safe, secure loving family. Now my SIL as an example, has A LOT of rules, so<br/>
some would assume lots of structure. But does not have the same peaceful<br/>
living environment that we experience in my opinion. She spends a lot of<br/>
time chasing down people including her dh to reprimand them for not doing<br/>
something, not doing it right or doing something or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I am not sure if I am rambling or making any sense anymore, so will end<br/>
here, <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I hope something in this helped,<br/>
<br/>

Hi, My name is Katie and I am a stay at home mama to Mabel who is 7 <br/>
months.  We are fully an AP family.  We live in Denver, Colorado. <br/>
(if anyone else is close by, :o))  Mabel is very active and started <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-762421719">This is, of course, in hopes that she goes outdoors (only temporary, I don&#39;t mean it to come across as letting her play for an hour without one! ) anyway, in hopes that she goes <br/>
out and feels the cold air and thinks to herself, I need a coat.  <br/>
 <br/>
*****<br/>
 <br/>
Or maybe she won&#39;t feel the need for a coat, and will play for more than hour without one!  As long as she&#39;s comfortable, that&#39;s not a problem either.  I have pictures of Andy at 6yo, running on a playground in the sleet (on Dec 21) wearing a coat -- over his shorts and flip-flops (year-round footwear for Andy), having a ball!  Colds and illness aren&#39;t caused by cold weather, or even getting cold -- they&#39;re caused by a virus.  Comfort is the issue, and some people are less sensitive to cold (or heat) than others.  <br/>
 <br/>
My theory has always been that my kids are aware enough to know when they&#39;re cold, and to ask for a coat/sweater accordingly.  I remember when Will (19 now) was small and my Mom would get upset with me for letting him play outside without a coat.  I told her I&#39;ve wondered if maybe the reason we were always so sensitive to cold was that she bundled us up so.  She was always the &#39;put on a sweater -- I&#39;m cold&#39; kind of Mom.  I was determined to let my kids find their own comfort level with the weather.  As it turns out, they&#39;re all much more tolerant of both cold and heat than I am.  For me, heat&#39;s not a big problem, but I get chilled quickly.  At sundown, they and their Dad are still out in shorts and t-shirts, while I&#39;ve pulled on a sweatshirt. <br/>

<h4>Kiersten Pasciak</h4>
<p><small><time>24 Aug 2004, at  6:42am</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-431222620"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi, My name is Katie and I am a stay at home mama to Mabel who <br/>
 </span></blockquote>is 7 months.  We are fully an AP family.  We live in Denver, <br/>
Colorado. (if anyone else is close by, :o))  Mabel is very active <br/>
and started crawling backwards at 5 months and forward at 6.  Sounds <br/>
like Emma. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Hi Katie! This is Kiersten, mom to Jacob and Emma. Get yourself <br/>
ready for a crazy ride, LOL. my advice is to treat her with the <br/>
respect you would show a friend. Even when my kids were very small, <br/>
we didn&#39;t shout at them to do something. If they touched something <br/>
that could hurt them, for instance pulling on a plug, we would <br/>
say &quot;no hands please, that&#39;s not a toy&quot; while gently removing their <br/>
hands. Usually, I would then direct their attention to something <br/>
else. After a few times, they would listen and stop the action. <br/>
Warning, there was a small period where each kid decided to &quot;test&quot; <br/>
this and would grin right at me while actively reaching. They also <br/>
did and still do this with the &quot;come here please&quot; or &quot;time for a <br/>
clean diaper&quot; requests. Eventually, as they gained motor skills, we <br/>
carefully showed them &quot;how&quot; to do an action in a safe manner and let <br/>
them have at it. One day , we let Jacob play with daddy&#39;s amplifier <br/>
and he pluggeg it in and unplugged it for over an hour! Then he gave <br/>
up playing with cords...seems he had learned what he wanted for the <br/>
time being :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am already seeing her start to stay up later and later cause she <br/>
&gt; wants to practice standing up.  I am glad I am here to learn about <br/>
&gt; how to accept these challenges as they arise. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hope you can handle the sleep issue better than I have. It has been <br/>
very frustrating. Being on this list and reading the unschooling <br/>
books, even for just a week, has really changed my attitude and I am <br/>
watching what she chooses to play with when she is staying up. It is <br/>
pretty fascinating!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My question is...  how would you teach them to say please and <br/>
 </span></blockquote>thank <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; you?  Or to clear their plate and help out when a guest at <br/>
 </span></blockquote>someone&#39;s <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; home?  How do you teach them to help around the house?  Will they <br/>
&gt; naturally wish to do these things?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Jacob learned to be polite by example. Sometimes, if he asks <br/>
something in a tone or manner I don&#39;t personally like, I will just <br/>
tell him &quot;I don&#39;t like to be asked like that. When you ask politely, <br/>
it makes we more willing to help you&quot;. Same with behaving in a <br/>
store. When he behaves in an easy manner, I tell him &quot;I really <br/>
enjoyed coming here with you today. That makes me want to bring you <br/>
here again&quot; He loves this. Even if he is unhappy to leave a place, <br/>
like McDonald&#39;s playland, I tell him &quot;I know you had a lot of fun <br/>
today, we will come back again&quot;, while putting his shoes on. He will <br/>
ask &quot;Can we come again?&quot; to which I can easily say &quot;Yes, I had I <br/>
great time, I would love to bring you here again ANOTHER DAY, It&#39;s <br/>
time to go&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I would recommend the books by Faber and Mazlish...&quot;Sibling Rivalry&quot; <br/>
(even if you only have one), &quot;Liberated Parents...&quot; and &quot;How to Talk <br/>
so Kids Will Listen & Listen so Kids Will Talk&quot;. They really helped <br/>
me to see, the need for ME to be genuine with my kids about my <br/>
feelings. If I constantly do what they ask me, ignoring my own <br/>
feelings and needs, I will get grumpy and we will have a tough time. <br/>
I have learned to say &quot;yes&quot; as often as I am TRULY happy to do so, <br/>
to say &quot;yes, you can do that later, tomorrow, when daddy gets home, <br/>
etc.&quot; whenever I am not quite ready. Or &quot;I will think about it&quot; if I <br/>
am unsure. When I get frustrated I tell them. &quot;I am getting <br/>
frustrated, grrrrrrrr&quot; (roaring sound you hear) We work a lot on <br/>
identifying feelings and expressing them in non-destructive ways.<br/>
<br/>
I also look for acceptable outlets for unacceptable behavior.<br/>
If Jacob tries to kick Emma, I will tell him &quot;Kicking can hurt, we <br/>
don&#39;t kick people. You MAY kick the ball, the pillow, etc. Let&#39;s go <br/>
get it&quot; For climbing up stuff, &quot;Tables are not for climbing, you can <br/>
climb on the slide, couch, etc.&quot;. &quot;Crayons go on paper&quot; was popular <br/>
before I found Mr Clean Magic Erasers. Now I don&#39;t care and the <br/>
crayons pretty much stay on the paper. Even with Emma. Whenever <br/>
a &quot;new&quot; challenge pops up, I look for a response I can use that I <br/>
won&#39;t mind hearing them say to me or to another child because they <br/>
WILL repeat it!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I can&#39;t see the TV, Can you please move&quot; is SO much easier to hear <br/>
than &quot;Get out of my way&quot;. This came home when our niece (6) stayed <br/>
over the other night. She said things to my kids in the cruelest <br/>
ways and I was very bothered to know she must be hearing it <br/>
somewhere or at least not being asked to stop speaking that way if <br/>
it was of her own design. I told her that we treat people kindly in <br/>
our house and I would appreciate it if she could do the same while <br/>
she stayed with us. Then I tried to &quot;feed&quot; her polite ways to say <br/>
things as the need came up.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am with you on the need for some routines, although I was NOT <br/>
raised with very many. I have found FlyLady.net and the book &quot;Sink <br/>
Reflections&quot; to be incredibly helpful! The point is to set up <br/>
routines that make sense and make you happy. The kids will follow <br/>
along. Eating together may take more work, we don&#39;t have that one <br/>
down yet, but my kids are little and don&#39;t eat as late as my husband <br/>
gets home. They may never. Maybe our time playing games, reading <br/>
books, and hanging out outside together is just as good. We are <br/>
still talking and hanging out together! <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Absolutely!!!<br/>
They will learn more from natural consequences than you could ever <br/>
teach them with a lecture!<br/>
And they get the feeling of power from making their own choices!<br/>
Jsut DON&#39;T give then the standard &quot;I told you so&quot;, when they are <br/>

I also parctice using the royal &quot;we&quot; and &quot;us&quot; a lot!!!<br/>
As in &quot;Let&#39;s clean up&quot; and then singing a song about cleaning up <br/>
while I do it. Usually they will join in. If not, fine. <br/>
<br/>
I hate to see kids who are told that they made the mess, so they <br/>
have to clean it up. This makes it seem like such a chore! If <br/>
cleaning is not such a big deal (in our attitude and actions) then I <br/>
feel it will be less of a struggle for our kids.<br/>
So far, my 2 both love to help clean. It is just a game.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I read a great article by Naomi Aldort a year or so ago that really <br/>
spoke to me about manners and modeling.  I had already had these <br/>
thoughts, but this was the first time that I learned that others might <br/>
feel the same way.  &quot;How Children Learn Manners&quot; is linked at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.naturalchild.org/naomi_aldort/manners.html">http://www.naturalchild.org/naomi_aldort/manners.html</a>    That whole web <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, as others have mentioned, modeling is the most likely way that <br/>
they will pick that up.  Forcing compliance doesn&#39;t make them *want* to <br/>
do anything.  ;)  I&#39;m going to refer you back to Sandra Dodd&#39;s site to <br/>
her page on &quot;chores&quot; at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/chores">http://sandradodd.com/chores</a><br/>

 </span></blockquote>Did you?  How would you have known any different?  It&#39;s kind of easy to <br/>
just assume that you must have &quot;needed&quot; something because that&#39;s the <br/>
way you were raised, but if we really look hard and break things down <br/>
sometimes things aren&#39;t what they seem.  Not suggesting that this bears <br/>
true for you, but I&#39;ve heard some people (usually male) state that they <br/>
&quot;needed&quot; to be spanked as a child and that getting spanked helped to <br/>
keep them good.  Yikes!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; [I loved that we ate dinner together at almost the same time every<br/>

&gt; how you set all this up while still letting your children be free.]<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I enjoy eating meals together often also, but my children don&#39;t care <br/>
either way.  They&#39;re just as happy to grab their plate and take it with <br/>
them to watch a movie (or I&#39;ll bring it to them) or work on a craft <br/>
project, or leave it at the table and run up to grab a bite or two <br/>
before scampering off to whatever they&#39;re interests are taking them.  <br/>
They&#39;re free to choose if they want to participate in a family dinner <br/>
and oftentimes they do sit and eat with us, but if they didn&#39;t want to <br/>
I certainly wouldn&#39;t insist on it.  An upset or crying child isn&#39;t <br/>
going to be making any happy memories of family dinners nor is it <br/>
likely that the rest of the diners are going to enjoy their dinner <br/>
while one person is obviously upset and unhappy.  KWIM?  I hope that <br/>
makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; [Are there any family rules?  Any rules at all?]<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmmmm... more like &quot;principles&quot; rather than &quot;rules&quot;.  Big things like <br/>
not hurting each other is, I guess, closer to a rule in our home, but <br/>
that&#39;s about it.  Once more, back to Sandra&#39;s wonderful site for <br/>
principles vs. rules at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/rules">http://sandradodd.com/rules</a><br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; [For example, do you let your kid go out of the house in the snow<br/>
&gt; without a coat or sweater just cause they feel like it?]<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sure!  It&#39;s likely that they won&#39;t stay out there for very long if it&#39;s <br/>
really cold, and if/when they do come in I make a point of *not* saying <br/>
or acting like &quot;I told you so&quot;.  Just happily help them with their coat <br/>
(if they need/want your help).  You might even offer to make hot <br/>
chocolate for them when they&#39;re done outside.  Or warm up soup.  Or <br/>
have warm, dry clothing ready for them to change into once their coats <br/>
and boots are off.  Comfort.  Love.  Warmth.   These are the things I <br/>
want my children to remember about me.  Take that into the rest of your <br/>
Mothering and you can&#39;t go wrong.  ;)<br/>

<br/>
She is our first, and this was something that I felt was the right way to &quot;teach&quot; her manners, when I heard it, thought I did have doubts anyway! (PS taught me well to doubt myself, lol!!)<br/>

We are polite to each other and her, and now she behaves the same way. It works beautifully, and just wanted to reassure you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-325296595">&lt;&lt;&lt;I am having a hard time grasping how you <br/>
raise your kids into polite, respectful adults without any control.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s modeling.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s treating them how you would wish them to be - with respect and<br/>
politeness and kindness.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not punishing a child for being childish in behavior or abilities.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s living and enjoying the present moment as much as possible and trusting<br/>
the future to take care of itself.<br/>
<br/>
Be aware that young kids living in freedom sometimes seem &quot;wild&quot; and<br/>
&quot;uncontrolled&quot; in comparison to kids who living with punishments and rules<br/>
will seem &quot;compliant&quot;. Our kids are honest, expressive, and have no fear of<br/>
us. When they are older they are still open, connected with their parents<br/>
and charming. (come to the Live and Learn Conference - see for yourself.)<br/>
<br/>
Our little kids will initiate conversations with adults. They will express<br/>
their opposing opinions and stand up for themselves strongly. Other people<br/>
might call that &quot;talking back&quot;; we call it &quot;having a conversation&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;My question is...  how would you teach them to say please and thank <br/>
you?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; them any of things you mention. That is the whole point of<br/>
Unschooling. We lead by example towards them, spouses to each other, towards<br/>
our friends and neighbors. <br/>
<br/>
Since your child is so young you might get a lot out of www.naturalchild.org<br/>
This is an Attachment Parenting Uber-site.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;It&#39;s just so vastly different <br/>
than our entire society has been trained to think.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That is precisely why Ren and Kelly have set up this list, and the sister<br/>
lists exist - because Unschooling is living in a way that is different from<br/>
the rest of society, and the thinking behind every decision and action comes<br/>
from different priorities than mainstream society, and mainstream parenting.<br/>
Changing our thinking is the toughest challenge for many. This list helps<br/>
people to do that.<br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I&#39;d like to know <br/>
how you give them structure in this type of environment.  I know I <br/>
needed structure growing up.  I needed daily routines and rituals.  <br/>
I loved that we ate dinner together at almost the same time every <br/>
night.  I loved that my dad tucked me into bed and said the same <br/>
prayers to me.  I think stability is important too.  I&#39;m wondering <br/>
how you set all this up while still letting your children be free.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You may have believed you needed structure because you were not Unschooled<br/>
(or some other reason). Unschooling does not mean you have to throw out<br/>
every pleasant memory of your childhood, but it may make you question why<br/>
you enjoyed certain things. Please don&#39;t become emotionally attached to the<br/>
idea that your child will necessarily need and enjoy the same things you<br/>
did, although she may. She may want something different. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Structure&quot; is not something that is either laudable OR reprehensible in<br/>
itself. Try thinking of routines and structures as an organizational tool<br/>
that you can take or leave, depending on your child&#39;s needs, and in any<br/>
given situation, and that can change over time. Rigid and uncompromising are<br/>
two characteristics to avoid.<br/>
<br/>
For many traditional families nightly dinner is the ONLY time the family can<br/>
get together due to work and school and homework. If you find your family<br/>
enjoys dinners together every night, or once a week, or prefers that family<br/>
meal to be breakfast, or prefers to eat in different places, you are free to<br/>
create your own traditions that fill the needs of all the members of your<br/>
family.<br/>
<br/>
Some children ask for routines - then help them create them. Understand that<br/>
a routine should only be followed while it is useful and helpful. Routines<br/>
should never supersede the needs of the child.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Are there any family rules?  Any rules at all?  For example, do you <br/>
let your kid go out of the house in the snow without a coat or <br/>
sweater just cause they feel like it? &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One of the things to think about is what you are depriving your child of<br/>
every time you force some rule on them, or make a decision for them. <br/>
<br/>
You are depriving them of the chance to use their ability to make a<br/>
decision. You are depriving them of the opportunity to feel competent and<br/>
confident. You are depriving them of a parent who is thinking logically and<br/>
living in the present the moment. You are depriving them of the chance to<br/>
discover something new to them about the world. <br/>
<br/>
You are depriving yourself of the chance to make a lifelong memory of some<br/>
wonderful, unlikely, imaginative solution to the problem before you that<br/>
your child will come up with. When they are given the chance to do so, they<br/>
really do come up with some wild, different, creative ideas in any<br/>
situation.<br/>
<br/>
Children are not stupid or willful or deliberately manipulating. This &quot;coat<br/>
in the snow&quot; example drives me nuts - being so trivial. People can tell if<br/>
they are cold or not. Just bring along the coat without comment, and she<br/>
will ask for it when she&#39;s ready. If however you have set up a power<br/>
struggle, or say &quot;I told you so&quot; in words or attitude, she will likely act<br/>
on her emotional needs for self determination, instead of her body&#39;s cues,<br/>
and refuse to put the coat for on long after she would have.<br/>
<br/>
Rules are made to be broken, or gotten around, or &quot;let&#39;s find the loophole&quot;,<br/>
or &quot;let&#39;s test them and see if disaster really will ensue&quot;. You have a lot<br/>
of reading ahead of you on Principles vs Rules. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2139366891">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I would recommend the books by Faber and Mazlish...&quot;Sibling Rivalry&quot; <br/>
(even if you only have one), &quot;Liberated Parents...&quot; and &quot;How to Talk <br/>
so Kids Will Listen & Listen so Kids Will Talk&quot;. They really helped <br/>
me to see, the need for ME to be genuine with my kids about my <br/>
feelings.&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
<br/>
I would recommend &quot;How to Talk...&quot; but I can&#39;t second the &quot;Liberated<br/>
Parents....&quot; one. (Haven&#39;t read &quot;Sibling Rivalry&quot; so no comment).<br/>
<br/>
I recently finished &quot;Liberated Parents&quot; and it would seem definitely to be<br/>
an early work. The format was somewhat irritating, but it was the content<br/>
that fell short. What I find increasingly with many of these child<br/>
development type books is that they just don&#39;t go as far into the realm of<br/>
respect and compassion for kids as Unschoolers do. I get better, more<br/>
rigorous suggestions from the lists - for free. <br/>
<br/>
In this book, after 5 years or more of attending the parent workshop (a<br/>
construct of the book) the main characters, or their spouses, were still<br/>
punishing, yelling and even spanking in some cases! There was a lot that<br/>
seemed like manipulation, rather than genuine freedom of choice. It just<br/>
didn&#39;t wash. There is way too much compensating for the emotional damage of<br/>
school, without the choice to not go to school ever mentioned. That made it<br/>
seem irrelevant to me. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;How to Talk..&quot; seems to be much more general in that a lot of the problems<br/>
used as examples are not school related. It seems to be close to NVC, which<br/>
could be another concept to look at.<br/>
<br/>
There is some good stuff about dealing with children&#39;s emotions at<br/>
www.naturalchild.org   especially Jan Hunt and Naomi Aldort.<br/>

<br/>
I agree it fell short in several areas.<br/>
The MAJOR thing I did get out of it which was NOT specifically <br/>
addressed in the other two, was being genuine about your own <br/>
feelings in a compassionate way. They go into such detail in the <br/>
other two about helping your kids recognize their feelings and <br/>
accepting that there are no &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; feelings, just <br/>
inapropriate ways of expressing them. I was left still acting like a <br/>
martyr while I tried to meet all their needs and wound up neglecting <br/>
my own. Truly, how long can you wait to go to the bathroom because <br/>
your kids &quot;need&quot; you? When Jacob was a baby, it pained me so much to <br/>
make him wait, that I would honestly take him to the bathroom with <br/>
me, still latched on and nursing and try to undress, pee, and <br/>
redress with the hand not supporting him, LOL. After reading that <br/>
chapter, a lightbulb went off and I was able to kindly tell my kids <br/>
if I needed them to wait, or that we could do what they wanted on a <br/>
different day because the timing wasn&#39;t good, or whatever as the <br/>
need arose. I began to treat MYSELF with the respect I deserved too. <br/>
That can only be good for them to see, in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I agree much of their work IS manipulation. Offering your kid 2 <br/>
choices and if they don&#39;t pick, you do! We started with this and <br/>
then moved to helping figure out more choices if the first 2 or3 <br/>
were unacceptable.<br/>
<br/>
I do however think they are a great starting point as they explain <br/>
why techniques such as hitting, shaming, and the ever popular &quot;time <br/>
out&quot; are poor choices. It is amazing how many people swear by these <br/>
methods while their children are tiny and then can&#39;t seem to figure <br/>
out what &quot;happened&quot; when their children get bigger, resent the power <br/>
play, and act up.<br/>

my own. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What has happened to me since being on UnschoolingDiscussion for so long (it<br/>
must be getting close to 2.5 -3 years), is that the above issues have come<br/>
around in a cyclic manner repeatedly. It seems like almost every larger<br/>
parenting issue has come around in this way. So from that I feel like I have<br/>
already received most of the information in parenting books - only skewed to<br/>
Unschooling, which is where I want to go.<br/>
<br/>
I felt this way about &quot;The Unschooling Handbook&quot; which is often recommended<br/>
to new Unschoolers - who would certainly get the most benefit from it.<br/>
However, by the time I got hold of a copy I had heard everything in it, for<br/>
free, on line, in many cases from the same writers.<br/>
<br/>
As you say, these books can be a good starting point. However my<br/>
recommendation is usually &quot;The Unprocessed Child&quot;, just because it deals<br/>
with these type of issues definitely from an Unschooling perspective.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Truly, how long can you wait to go to the bathroom because <br/>
your kids &quot;need&quot; you? When Jacob was a baby, it pained me so much to <br/>
make him wait, that I would honestly take him to the bathroom with <br/>
me, still latched on and nursing and try to undress, pee, and <br/>

need arose. I began to treat MYSELF with the respect I deserved too. <br/>
That can only be good for them to see, in my opinion.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m seeing what you mean about not being a martyr. However any book that<br/>
suggests, or can be taken as suggesting, that parents&#39; needs are more<br/>
important than (rather than somewhat equal to) the child&#39;s needs, is going<br/>
to raise red flags to me.<br/>
<br/>
I read about you taking your nursing baby into the bathroom and don&#39;t see<br/>
the story of a mom unreasonably being a martyr. I see a mom doing exactly as<br/>
she should! Both of you getting your needs met to a degree - and nursing<br/>
toddler outweighs comfort for mom. (Out*weighs* - one hand - get it? Heh,<br/>
heh.)<br/>
<br/>
Seriously though - it is so temporary, the tiny neediness and inability to<br/>
empathize. I&#39;ve been exactly there - sometimes Jayn still comes into the<br/>
bathroom to sit on my lap, if I&#39;m ...stuck there for a while. (Gross images<br/>
free for the taking).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I do however think they are a great starting point as they explain <br/>
why techniques such as hitting, shaming, and the ever popular &quot;time <br/>
out&quot; are poor choices. It is amazing how many people swear by these <br/>
methods while their children are tiny and then can&#39;t seem to figure <br/>
out what &quot;happened&quot; when their children get bigger, resent the power <br/>
play, and act up.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I guess one reason I prefer &quot;How to Talk...&quot; is because it clearly and<br/>
succinctly offers a course of action. Accepting that these dopey old ways<br/>
can be discarded is easier for people if they have an alternative in front<br/>
of them - less fear.<br/>
