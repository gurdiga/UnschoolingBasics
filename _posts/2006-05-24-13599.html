 </span></blockquote>Joyce, I hate cleaning toilets, too.  So I don&#39;t anymore :)  I bought these<br/>
thingies made by Kablam (which I think is actually owned by Orange Glo) They<br/>
go into the back of the toilet tank and keep the toilet clean with every<br/>
flush.  I was a bit skeptical at first because I&#39;ve tried other products<br/>
that claim the same.  The bleach tablets always ate away at the gaskets and<br/>
I was forever changing valves and gaskets in the tank.  This thing feeds the<br/>
water right into the tank and so the chemicals (although they say they are<br/>
safe for a dog to continue to drink from the bowl - not that I&#39;m going to<br/>
test that theory and glad I don&#39;t have a dog LOL!)  don&#39;t harm the tank<br/>
parts.  No change in the water color, no chlorine smell, just a clean<br/>
toilet.  Change the unit every 3 months or so and no more toilet scrubbing!<br/>
