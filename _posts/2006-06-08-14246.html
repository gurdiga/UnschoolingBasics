<div id="ygrps-yiv-1117206692">There&#39;s been a lot of talk on the lists lately about how difficult it  <br/>
is when people ask about homeschooling, or what curriculum you use. I  <br/>
just wanted to share why it&#39;s good to keep going....<br/>
<br/>
Tonight I attended a meeting, one not at all about school/homeschool,  <br/>
but about autism. When I mentioned that I homeschool, one of the  <br/>
ladies asked me what curriculum I use. Usually i get kind of uptight  <br/>
about that, and whatever. But tonight I just said that I don&#39;t use  <br/>
curriculum at all, and the lady just started gushing! She said she  <br/>
loved me! LOL! Turns out, she is an unschooler too, and had never met  <br/>
another before. SO going out on a limb, I share Sandra Dodd&#39;s website  <br/>
and mention that she&#39;s *radical*, and we&#39;re working on that too. SO  <br/>
IS SHE!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just wanted to let you know, keep the faith. You may get  <br/>
several people who will conditionally approve of homeschooling, but  <br/>
you&#39;ll get a lot of people who think it&#39;s great. And then every once  <br/>
in a while you come up against a compadre...someone who not only  <br/>
KNOWS what you&#39;re talking about but is on the same path. Truly cool.  <br/>
She&#39;s just starting out, but we&#39;re on a committee together and we&#39;ll  <br/>
be seeing each other again.<br/>
