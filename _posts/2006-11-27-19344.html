<div id="ygrps-yiv-240691157">I&#39;ve been thinking about &quot;giftedness.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If one is truly gifted, wouldn&#39;t that be true for the person&#39;s <br/>
lilfetime?<br/>
<br/>
There were kids I knew when I was growing up who were labeled gifted <br/>
who have done nothing with their &quot;gifts&quot;---for many reasons. Some were <br/>
far ahead of the rest of us; as the rest of us caught up, they became <br/>
just like the rest. Some were burnt out because their parents pushed so <br/>
hard; they lost the desire to learn/do more. Some, of course, had <br/>
*real* gifts and went on to use them wholly and fully. Some <br/>
rediscovered themselves after years of feeling lost and labeled. Funny.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing the child simply as Who He Is *has* to be better than <br/>
*qualifying* who he is.<br/>
<br/>
Were any of you labeled as gifted? What have you done with that <br/>
giftedness? Labeled as LD (&quot;retarded&quot; before LD became PC). Did you <br/>
know folks with these labels? What has become of them? Who was your <br/>
high school valedictorian? What&#39;s s/he doing now? What&#39;s the average <br/>
classmate doing now? The drop-out?<br/>
<br/>
I had a 28 year reunion party last month. It was very interesting to <br/>
see who&#39;s doing what and why. I asked a lot of questions of many <br/>
people. The reasons folks chose the jobs/careers/paths they <br/>
have---pretty interesting. Made me appreciate letting my children <br/>
follow their passions and unschooling all the more!<br/>

   <br/>
  ****<br/>
   <br/>
  The label gifted wasn&#39;t being used widely where/when I was in high school, but I was required by the school to take &#39;honors&#39; level classes.  Yes, required.  I remember when I was signing up for junior year writing/English classes. I really didn&#39;t want to take the two choices available to me. There were three &#39;writing&#39; credit classes -- Composition, which was a basic writing class; Informative Writing, a very intensive weekly paper kinda class (where all the really brainy kids ended up); and Humanities, a two-hour block honors class encompassing writing and social studies.  I really wanted to take Composition -- I wanted to be normal for cryin&#39; out loud, and I hated to write (and I wanted a break, since I was taking a 3-hr foreign language class, keeping me in school from 7am to 5pm, M-F). I had to have my 10th grade English teacher sign off on my choice and she refused to sign off on Composition -- told me I was too smart for that class and would only be allowed to take<br/>
 the honors choices.  I would have done anything to avoid Informative Writing, so I took Humanities.  I ended up hating it. The reading books assigned were awful, and the teacher was a joke.  I did become a writer that year -- in my Popular Fiction elective class, of all places. <br/>
   <br/>
  At the same time I was taking honors English/Social Studies classes, I was struggling to get thru one year&#39;s worth of Algebra in two years (really, dumb math for girls, but it served my mathphobia just fine, thank you) and Applied Chemistry (dumb chemistry for girls and jocks).  So, it was a mixed bag for me.  I felt really bad about the remedial-level math/science classes, and trapped in the honors level english/social studies classes.  <br/>
   <br/>
  We three grew up being told how smart we were -- well, they told us we&#39;d all scored higher than 160 on the IQ tests, and that one of us scored two points higher than the others, but to &#39;avoid hurt feelngs&#39; didn&#39;t tell us our exact scores (like we even cared at that point who was smarter).  I remember often being told &quot;you&#39;re too smart to make that kind of mistake&quot; as  kid -- what I felt/heard was that I was too smart to make any mistakes.  It sucked being smarter or whatever we were supposed to be.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I haven&#39;t been to any reunions, but I have kept up with/ recontaced some of my classmates.  The really smart one, of whom everyone had expected great things, has gone to do great things professionally -- she holds several patents, became an Electrical Engineer, then went to law school and is now a Patent Lawyer.  She&#39;s also twice-divorced (7 yrs ago, by now she&#39;s likely 3x divorced) and when we wrote all she could talk about was how much she disliked/resented her stepdaughters by dh #3.  Not exactly what I&#39;d call successful and happy, but to each her own, I guess.<br/>
   <br/>
  I graduated, my brother and sister did not, so I know two drop-outs.  Both went on to find good jobs; none of us went to college.  I was so mad when they were both allowed to drop out -- I would have gladly stopped, but I knew they&#39;d kill me if I even so much as failed a class, much less dropped out!  <br/>
   <br/>
  Most people I know who went to college don&#39;t work in their degree field. Most, it seems, tried it out and found it was a bad fit for them.  The few I know who have worked in their field and been happy at were the kind of people who&#39;d known since age 5 what they wanted to be.  I never really knew what I wanted to be when I grew up -- except a Mom, and in the 70&#39;s that alone wasn&#39;t a high enough aspiration for a smart girl, or at least so my Mom told me. <br/>
   <br/>
  When Will was 8 (2nd grade), I let the schools test him because they bugged me so about it (I knew he wasn&#39;t LD and thought it would get them off my back). They ruled out LD, deciding instead that he was either lazy and unmotivated, or had bad study skills, or maybe his homelife (me, yanno) just didn&#39;t encourage him enough.  It seems that even when one can avoid the LD label, they have another one handy to put on a child.  I realized then that the whole point of the labels is to remove all responsbility for failure from the school system -- it becomes all about the child&#39;s flaws.  Either s/he never had any potential, or s/he squandered it despite the schools &#39;best&#39; efforts.  Really a very handy system for the schools, doncha think?.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Kelly, your questions reminded me of the latest Life Learning magazine<br/>
and its editorials. There has been some ongoing discussion about Peter<br/>
 Kowalke&#39;s &quot;Grown Without Schooling&quot; articles in his column. The gist<br/>
was around the expectation of unschooled children &quot;doing more&quot; with<br/>
their lives, rather than succombing to the mainstream economic<br/>
machine, away from &quot;natural&quot; living. Both your questions about &#39;those<br/>
who were labeled gifted have done nothing with their &quot;gifts&quot;&#39;, and the<br/>
projection that unschooled children should &quot;do more&quot; (in the magazine)<br/>
are similar in nature, imo. They are Product Oriented. <br/>
<br/>
You stated that &quot;Seeing the child simply as Who He Is *has* to be<br/>
better than *qualifying* who he is.&quot; I would suggest, that to me,<br/>
seeing the child OR adult as Who He Is, is preferable to What He Does,<br/>
or How He Was Labeled. I understand your list of questions to be<br/>
rhetorical and reflective; but perhaps, the more relevant question is<br/>
&#39;Are they happy?&#39; I believe that we would agree that question is<br/>
significant at any age, regardless of labels being used or not.<br/>
<br/>
And generally, the term gifted is used in an academic sense indicating<br/>
 exceptional intellectual computation ability. As most of us believe,<br/>
emotional (environmental/nurture) issues are as profound in our lives<br/>
as genetic (nature) issues, in the present, not only the future.<br/>

<br/>
Yep. I haven&#39;t read the last two issues. They are staring at me now. <br/>
&lt;g&gt; But I haven&#39;t picked them up yet.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t talking about unschoolers though. Schooled kids who have been <br/>
touted as the &quot;best&quot; at something---you know, the LABELED ones! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Sure!<br/>
<br/>
And that was one of the interesting things I discovered at my reunion. <br/>
The happy vs the successful vs the &quot;average student&quot; vs the <br/>
valedictorian vs the &quot;poor student&quot; vs the passionate vs the <br/>
&quot;whatever&quot;---it was very eye-opening!<br/>
<br/>
This was a top private school. A lot was riding on each graduate. <br/>
Competition was tough.<br/>
<br/>
The happiness levels of these adults ranged from high to very, very <br/>
low. So did &quot;success.&quot;<br/>

And generally, the term gifted is used in an academic sense indicating<br/>

<br/>
And generally limited to math/science and language arts.<br/>
<br/>
Gifted in music & art & sports are considered &quot;extras&quot; only *after* the <br/>
math and English are done.<br/>
<br/>
Gifted in relationships/social situations, nature/animals, problem <br/>
solving, management, cooperation and others are not counted at all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2074670465">I don&#39;t post much but because my experience regarding this question<br/>
has so profoundly affected my life I thought I&#39;d throw it out there...<br/>
<br/>
I was always in &quot;honors&quot; and great things were expected of both me and<br/>
my brother. My dad set a tough standard by growing up poor, working<br/>
his way through college in 3 years and then a scholarship to medical<br/>
school where he shown brilliantly. He is not a happy man although a<br/>
very successful doctor. My dad asked me once what was important to me<br/>
in life, and I said happiness. He said it should be success.<br/>
<br/>
I loved classical piano and was pretty good at it by my own standards.<br/>
So I applied for and went to the Youth Performing Arts School in my<br/>
area for piano. And there I met people who were brilliant. I met<br/>
people who were composers. I met people who lived and breathed music.<br/>
I met Musicians. It quickly became apparent to me that I wasn&#39;t one of<br/>
those people. I was good, I enjoyed it, but I was not a Musician.<br/>
<br/>
And I felt really deflated. I had been told for so long that I was so<br/>
good, that it was a huge shock to find out I wasn&#39;t the best. And in<br/>
response I just gave up. I haven&#39;t played piano now in about 14 years.<br/>
<br/>
You could say a lot of things about the above, but the funny thing is<br/>
that I AM happy now, at least far happier than I&#39;ve ever been in my<br/>
entire life. I am staying at home with my 2 year old and for the most<br/>
part I love it. For all of my honors classes I don&#39;t have a degree<br/>
that&#39;s of any use to me and I don&#39;t have a &quot;career&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
For what it&#39;s worth, most of the people I have kept up with in those<br/>
honors classes aren&#39;t doing anything particularly heroic. Most of us<br/>
aren&#39;t doing anything related to our degrees. And those of us with the<br/>
strangest, most unlikely jobs, are the happiest, I would say. Except<br/>
for one dear friend who really lost her way is about to go to jail for<br/>
meth. Labels have not been good to me and I cringe every time someone<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1086614386">Your post reminded me of my cousin who was at my house yesterday.  She was tops at everything.  Graduated #1 both in her High School and College.  Absolutely Brilliant Girl (as she was labeled).  But I really don&#39;t think any of that scholarly stuff really mattered to her.  Once she got out in the professional business world........well she hated it, and realized it was just not her.  Her Passion:  Animals!  Especially dogs.  So she gave up what could have been a very lucrative, and successful (by some standards) career.  She now owns one of these places with the big tubs to bath your own dogs.  She does not make a lot of money at it, but she is doing her own thing, and is happy........much more important than all the money in the world.  She also judges Dog Agility shows so that is why she was out visiting my area.  We went to the show she was judging and had a great time.  And I can definately see where labeling my cousin gifted/talented/smart or whatever was really<br/>
 damaging to her.  She was expected to do absolutely exceptional things by society&#39;s standards and by her parents standards........it must have been pure hell for her.  I found her to be a very successful, interesting person to talk to.  <br/>

I was one of those &quot;smart&quot; kids but always felt average<br/>
as I was not as smart as my friends.  My mom always<br/>
touted the &#39;you can do whatever you want - just be happy&#39;<br/>
but never gave any guidance of what was out there.  (I was very naive)<br/>
 <br/>
I had no idea of what type of jobs were even out there let alone how<br/>
to get one.  I now have an awesome job but I stumbled into it by accident.<br/>
 <br/>
I totally agree that it&#39;s VERY important to enjoy if not LOVE what you do.<br/>
I like what my FIL did for my spouse.  He helped him to explore his <br/>
interest, took him to meet people who worked in the fields of interest,<br/>
and spent time helping him figure out how he would attain them.<br/>
My spouse has been very happy in his life doing just what he likes.<br/>

Exactly - pin the &quot;failure&quot; on the child and not on the school not <br/>
doing their job.  Having a child who had been in school up through 6th <br/>
grade (2 years ago) this really hits home.  I allowed a label of ADHD 5 <br/>
years ago (LONG before I had ever heard of unschooling or even <br/>
considered homeschooling) because I thought it would get her some <br/>
services (NOT).  I now know that my dd is very right-brained, which is  <br/>
not compatible with the predominantly left-brained way many schools <br/>
operate.<br/>

child.  He is in the &quot;gifted&quot; program through their school system.<br/>
Last year was a bit challenging and they changed teachers to try to<br/>
find something that would work better for him.  This year has been a<br/>
disaster and the schools are insisting that he is ADHD and needs<br/>
medicating.  Fortunately my friend is not buying into the medicating<br/>
part, but she does believe that he is ADHD.  I look at him and see a<br/>
completely BORED child.  He is one of those left-brainy kids and so is<br/>
