<div id="ygrps-yiv-1336022664">I need some help trying to figure out how to handle something. We are in a situation of wanting to move out of our house and trying to figure out where to move to. It&#39;s just me and my 2 daughters, 14 and 11. My husband and I divorced a few years ago, and once that happened, my first thought was to move out of this state (alaska) that we have lived in since my son was born over 19 years ago. I have never felt at home here, although happy, I&#39;ve always wished I was back in Colorado, or at least closer, I miss the state and my family is there. So, now, we are looking at moving out of our house that&#39;s too big. I would love to move back down to the lower 48 and my 14 year old is leaning strongly that way also, she would like to try somewhere out of alaska, find a nice small town, but, my 11 year old is adamant against it, this is home to her and she is very attached, desperately wanting to stay, forever :-) So, how do you handle something like that? Normally, we are good at making everybody happy, we tend to agree on most things, but this is huge and not agreeing is causing problems! We know that when we move, we want it to be to a house that we can stay in for a very long time. Any suggestions or thoughts would be so appreciated!! <br/>
Thanks!!<br/>
Susan</div>
