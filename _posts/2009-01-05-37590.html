An article listing 20 jobs that don&#39;t require a college degree and yet <br/>
make $50K or more per year. What they do require, it looks like, is <br/>
putting in your time and working your way up - most are supervisory <br/>
type positions which means starting out doing the small things and <br/>
working up into the bigger things (like managing a mini mart/gas <br/>
station - generally starts at minimum wage clerk and you work your way <br/>
into more responsiblities by being responsible - my brother did that <br/>
when he was in college, started as a clerk in a mini mart and ended up <br/>
assistant manager by the time he left after college graduation. Mostly <br/>
it took showing up on time ready to work and saying Yes when asked to <br/>
take on additional tasks, then doing those tasks in a timely, efficient <br/>
manner as instructed - like stocking the milk in the refrigerator).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1105744806">It was an interesting list to read through. There may be people currently in<br/>
those fields who do not have degrees, but a business or technical degree<br/>
would be beneficial for any of the &quot;supervisor&quot; type positions, even if not<br/>
strictly &quot;required&quot;. If someone is truly passionate about managing a payroll<br/>
department or a service station, they would also be interested in most of<br/>
the coursework leading to a management or business degree. It would be a<br/>
mistake for anyone to take a job which they were not passionate about, and a<br/>
2 or 4 year degree is not a burden if you are studying what you love.<br/>
<br/>
I worked as an engineer at a company here in Portland, Oregon for 10 years.<br/>
When I started, I had a BS and many of my colleagues had started years<br/>
earlier with no degree at all. After 10 years, I had completed a MS in<br/>
engineering and everyone without a degree has been let go during various<br/>
layoffs and subsequently replaced with engineers holding MS degrees. Only 1<br/>
engineer was left with a BS. There has been an inflation of educational<br/>
requirements in a lot of fields and where you used to be able to start based<br/>
on passion or experience or &quot;who you know&quot;, many jobs will require a degree<br/>
or certification because many employers use it to differentiate between an<br/>
over-abundance of applicants in a tight job market.<br/>
<br/>
If not going to college is a goal or requirement for your life, then you<br/>
will certainly have less options available and a more difficult time getting<br/>
into some fields, even when a degree is not required. I imagine that<br/>
technical trades such as plumbers and electricians would be a good match for<br/>
someone who wanted to get right in and manage their own path.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-830045704">true, I was an archaeology major, and NEVER used it to secure a job.  But, my best friend could not be a sonographer without some sort of education in a formal setting, nor could my other friend be a &quot;brain surgeon&quot; as we call him.  so college IS sometimes the only way, but there are definitely many passions that require no school at all! :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-306340192">Hi Ren, thanks for the reply. I&#39;m sorry if it sounded like I think everyone<br/>
should get a degree, that is certainly not the case. I agree that a goal of<br/>
following your dreams is not a goal of not going to college.<br/>
<br/>
I just don&#39;t understand the purpose of creating a list of jobs that do not<br/>
require a degree unless finding a career without a degree requirement is the<br/>
goal. People should follow a life and career path which they are passionate<br/>
about and through hard work or study or whatever else is required, follow<br/>
their dreams. Someone can either choose from a list like this and pursue one<br/>
of those jobs, or follow their passion and deal with the requirements when<br/>
they show up. You are correct that in many cases, the requirements are more<br/>
of guidelines anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I would never encourage my kids to go to college unless they knew for<br/>
certain what they were trying to achieve and why a degree was needed. Some<br/>
parents may push their kids into college when nobody has any idea why they<br/>
are even there. I went to college to get a Master&#39;s degree because I was<br/>
excited about computer engineering and was not being exposed to state of the<br/>
art tech at the company I was at. The university gave me access to dozens of<br/>
new mentors in the industry and along with the new degree, landed me the<br/>
position I had long been looking for.<br/>
<br/>
Until relatively recently, anyone could be a doctor with only a desire to<br/>
heal the sick or injured and some experience. Now, by law, if medicine is<br/>
your calling then college is in your future. It&#39;s the same story with<br/>
professional engineering. My main point was that I know people doing many of<br/>
the jobs on that list in some form or another and they all have degrees. I<br/>
do believe that college is a strict requirement for some fields, may be an<br/>
enabler to a career in other fields, and totally irrelevant in many other<br/>
exciting areas such as being a makeup artist. College may be exciting for<br/>
some, a necessary evil for others, or even a formality that is unacceptable<br/>
to some.<br/>
<br/>
Follow your dreams..<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-199468578">The beleif that everyone needs a degree is very strong here in Canada too.  It&#39;s very hard for a parent to let go of that, when evidence (I&#39;m speaking only from personal experience) rears it&#39;s ugly head around every day that a degree opens up a lot more choices.  My colleague has many years of parent education experience, three launched children and yet, because she doesn&#39;t have a degree in anything (from science to nursing) she can&#39;t get a job teaching parenting for our health department.  That is the basic minimum hiring standards.  I know that twenty years ago, a high school diploma and  a hefty dose of inititive could get many people careers in their chosen fields, but I can&#39;t say the same thing now days.  Sorry to be so pessimistic.  I want to beleive that hard work and initiative will get anyone where they want to go, but I see so much evidence to the contrary, I can&#39;t pass that on to my kids. <br/>
Still, I fully realize that I can&#39;t make my kids want it.<br/>

both get the idea that sometimes those are two different things. Ray <br/>
(at 15) has quite a bit of work experience and much of it is in an <br/>
area that he doesn&#39;t necessarily love - agriculture and landscaping - <br/>

least not right now. Right now he wants to play with fire! <br/>

<br/>
A friend of ours, homeschooled for the majority of his minority (LOL)<br/>
worked as a cashier at a mini mart for a few years - very not his<br/>
passion. As he was naturally a night owl, he could work the quieter late<br/>
night shifts (with a shift differential so a little bit extra pay). That<br/>
left him lots of thinking space and daylight hours (late afternoons and<br/>
early evenings) to pursue his passion - cartooning. It also was a<br/>
flexible enough type job that he could take a few days off to go to<br/>
trade shows and expos related to cartooning/art/etc. He&#39;s now making<br/>
money with his twin passions - music and drawing (www.toddbot.com is his<br/>
website - the bio section gives some idea of the things he&#39;s worked<br/>
on/is working on, other sections you can see some of his work)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1667993190">-----Original Message-----<br/>
From: Professional Parenting &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jarnall@...">jarnall@...</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The beleif that everyone needs a degree is very strong here in Canada too.  It&#39;s <br/>
very hard for a parent to let go of that, when evidence (I&#39;m speaking only from <br/>
personal experience) rears it&#39;s ugly head around every day that a degree opens <br/>
up a lot more choices.  My colleague has many years of parent education <br/>
experience, three launched children and yet, because she doesn&#39;t have a degree <br/>
in anything (from science to nursing) she can&#39;t get a job teaching parenting for <br/>
our health department.  That is the basic minimum hiring standards.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And someone needs a job in the health department to help parents?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s where I start questioning. OK---so what IS &quot;parent education experience&quot;? Why would somebody need a degree to &quot;teach&quot; it? What&#39;s stopping her from getting a degree? Why can&#39;t she start her own &quot;parenting&quot; business, if that&#39;s what she wants to do? What other options are there? I have dozens of other questions---and I really don&#39;t want the answers. It&#39;s just that such a &quot;position&quot; could be looked at from *dozens* of different angles, but it seems she&#39;s only looking at one.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I know that <br/>
twenty years ago, a high school diploma and  a hefty dose of inititive could get <br/>
many people careers in their chosen fields, but I can&#39;t say the same thing now <br/>
days. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Twenty years ago?  That sounds twisted20to me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say, *maybe*....50 years ago. Seventy-five years ago, for SURE! But 50 years ago, a *college* diploma was a sure fire trip to easy street! Twenty years ago, it was already considered a necessity to have a college degree---and to be a *real* success, you needed a master&#39;s---THAT was your ticket out! Ten years ago, a PhD was the only way to BE somebody.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The difference between the 1950s and the 2000s is NOW college tuition is ASTRONOMICAL! A college student today will pay (I looked it up) about $25,000 in tuition alone for four years at a state college, and four times that for a private school---not including books and room & board! A graduate will spend *years* covering student loans if he chooses *that* route. Starting OUT with debt? Crazy! ANd there&#39;s NO guarantee that a job will be waiting! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For $120,000 (what it would cost to send Cameron four years to (one of &lt;g&gt;) my alma mater(s), a small private college in SC), I could set him up in a business of his choosing. He would be MAKING money rather than paying off debt. He wouldn&#39;t be looking for an entry-level job; he would OWN the business; he would BE the boss. It&#39;s just that I can think of waaay better ways to spend Ben&#39;s money &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If he *needed* a degree to get what he wants. I would do that too. But he doesn&#39;t. Nor do *most* college students---they&#39;re just jumping through the hoops without thinking. The reason businesses put the degree requirement on their &quot;basic minimum&quot; for=2<br/>
0hiring is that they need *some* way to weed out candidates. There&#39;s often a loophole. You may have to work to find it though. Volunteering is a great way to get a foot in the door---especially if you are already good at what you do. Many businesses will still help pay to help you get a degree if it will benefit *them*. But they have to know you first.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Sorry to be so pessimistic.  I want to beleive that hard work and initiative will get anyone <br/>
<br/>
where they want to go, but I see so much evidence to the contrary, I can&#39;t pass that on to my <br/>
<br/>
kids. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you believe you can or believe you can&#39;t, you are right.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Attitude is everything. I&#39;ve owned nine businesses--and am working on the tenth. No degree.<br/>
