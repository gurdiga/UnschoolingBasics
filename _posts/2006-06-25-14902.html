<div id="ygrps-yiv-985199032">These past couple of days, I have had some really cool thoughts come my way, and wanted to share a couple with you all.<br/>
Last night, as my man and I watched the tivo&#39;d Henry Rollins show from this week, he wrote a great letter to one of his teachers.  He does spots on his show where he writes letters, some have been to the FCC, to Pat Roberts.  Always entertaining!<br/>
Anyway, last night in his letter he expressed his feelings as to the fact that nothing he learned in school was relevant to living his life now, and that everything he knows now he has had to learn ON HIS OWN.  Of course there was lots of very colorful language thrown in there, but it was so fun to listen to.  He should have been unschooled! :)<br/>
I tried to find the link so I could post that letter on my blog, but haven&#39;t been able to find it yet.  His show airs on the IFC, so you can find more about it (if ya want to!) on ifc.com.<br/>
<br/>
Second affirmation came to me today in the form of a quote, here it is, enjoy it!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The world is round.  Sail as far as you will in search of truth.  You will encounter storms; you may be wrecked.  But in the long run, the universe is on the side of those who trust their own minds, value supremely their own experiences, and dare to sail under their own, true colors.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Namaste~<br/>
