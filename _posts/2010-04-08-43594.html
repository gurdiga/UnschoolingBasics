<div id="ygrps-yiv-1963160611">Hello Everyone!<br/>
I am wondering if anyone is familiar with or has any info on something I vaguely remember from a few years ago. <br/>
<br/>
I remember hearing/reading about some sort of unschooling/homeschooling through the &#39;brown road signs&#39; those historical sites signs across the country. I almost think it might have been some workshop at an unschooling conference? <br/>
<br/>
I keep trying to google different things to see if there is any sort of advice/info or stories of how someone/others might have done this.<br/>
<br/>
We are moving from Maine to Alaska. I&#39;m trying so hard to plan some sort of stops along the way. There is so much to see and do with no possibility (especially with me having a newborn at that time) of seeing it all. It&#39;s pretty overwhelming trying to plan a route!! I don&#39;t want to just hit the tacky tourist popular sites like yellowstone/mt rushmore etc....but remembered someone having some &#39;brown sign schooling&#39; thing they did.<br/>
<br/>
Does this ring a bell at all with any of you?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Steph</div>

Have you made contact with any of the unschoolers in Alaska yet? My sis is one...she did a six month road trip all over the U.S. so could probably give you some input on unschool/family-friendly stops.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1347532920">i I don&#39;t know about brown sign schooling but you could meet unschoolers on the way there and they could tell you the good spots to stop. You could add a stop at my Dairy Farm in SE Minnesota for example! ITs seems like on the way for you and we would be happy to meet you. I have had several unschoolers came visit!  THere are some great places before and after to stop and it is on the way to Mount Rushmore !<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-229834783">When we moved to Portland from Albuquerque a couple of years ago, I tried to think of places Megan (then almost 7, I think) would like. Zoe was around 18 months old (I think). Inexpensive was also high on my list.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted our move to be an adventure, not just something that stressed out the adults in her life.  <br/>
<br/>
Megan is a huge animal lover and I planned our route to take us through Las Vegas because going to Vegas was a big deal to her. I&#39;m not sure why, lol. But she really wanted to walk along the strip at night. So we did. We also visited the M&M store and saw the tigers at the MGM Grand hotel. That was the free stuff. We paid to see Siegfried & Roys animal exhibit (big cats & dolphins). It may seem tacky & over the top to some, bit it was magic for Megan.  <br/>
<br/>
There was probably more we could have done, but we were moving with a cat & a rabbit in late Spring....stopping anywhere for long meant the animals could have overheated. My husband was also stressed about the logistics of the move, so I was really working on balancing the fun & work aspects of the move. <br/>
<br/>
So I guess where you stop depends on how far you want to drive in a day and what might interest the members of your family and how much *play time* your finances can handle.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t forget that kind of driving can be really tiring & planning an extra day here and there is a good idea. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-198796704">When Draven was 3 or so we did a two week long trip, spent way more than<br/>
half of it just driving.  We went from Baltimore Maryland to Austin Texas.<br/>
<br/>
One big thing I did was talk to my online homeschooling friends, and we<br/>
stayed with people along the way.  It was nice to put faces to text, and it<br/>
was nice to have a place to crash each night where there were kids so Draven<br/>
could play, and I could chat.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing I did was join AAA.  I only joined for a month, but that gave<br/>
me access to their trip guides, which I seem to remember had maps with all<br/>
of the major parks shown.  Instead of stopping at rest stops, we planned out<br/>
how to stop at parks that were near our travel route.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-393500227">Something we found essential when we moved from OK back to CT (and any<br/>
time we travel with overnights) is to find a place at least every other<br/>
night with a pool. Depending on time of year, that can sometimes mean<br/>
added expense (finding hotels with indoor pools) but after a day or two<br/>
of driving, even with &quot;fun&quot; stops in the mix, it was really helpful for<br/>
all of us to be in water - even if we just spent 20-30 minutes in the<br/>
pool. I suppose that doesn&#39;t necessarily apply to every family but it is<br/>
really helpful for us, especially DH and DS, to be able to just let all<br/>
the physical tension of driving and being in a relatively fixed position<br/>
for a stretch kind of dissipate in the pool. We all sleep better and<br/>
feel more refreshed when we start out again.<br/>
