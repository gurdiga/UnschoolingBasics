I know it&#39;s different from state to state since my friend in Nevada says her kids can participate in high school sports in their district.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi - the school is pretty much correct - public and private schooling  <br/>
is EXTREMELY separate in California and that&#39;s good for our  <br/>
indepedence as homeschoolers using the private school option.  I&#39;ve  <br/>
been the HSC (HomeSchool Association of California) county contact  <br/>
for Orange County for many years and it is my experience that it is  <br/>
extremely unlikely that you could homeschool independently in  <br/>
California and be able to participate in any school-based activities.  <br/>
However, some people get around this by enrolling in a school  <br/>
district independent study program. It doesn&#39;t always work - seems to  <br/>
work when the coach really wants the player, if you know what I mean.  <br/>
It is sometimes possible to unschool and still be enrolled in a  <br/>
public school isp - you have to be a little creative and figure out  <br/>
how to report on your child&#39;s learning, just like people do in states  <br/>
that have homeschooling reporting requirements.<br/>
<br/>
So - if this is important to you - don&#39;t entirely despair, it might  <br/>
be possible. But you won&#39;t get anywhere fighting the school or CIF.<br/>
<br/>
Most people do not find it is important enough to go through the  <br/>
hassle - most find other sports outlets such as club play or  <br/>
recreational organizations such as AYSO.<br/>

<br/>
the school can so NO.  that&#39;s their right.  it&#39;s up to each individual<br/>
school.  <br/>
<br/>
if I were you, I&#39;d try to find other ways to do the sports your kids want to<br/>
do.  try the park district or local gyms. <br/>
