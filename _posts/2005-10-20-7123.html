 </span></blockquote>**Dagny was 10 when I started and 12 when I finished, and Rowan was 6 when I<br/>

7.<br/>

<br/>
**Well, we don&#39;t buy that many things :o).  I budget our money carefully.  I<br/>
have not worked outside the home since Dagny was a baby, so we live on Jon&#39;s<br/>
paychecks.  We&#39;ve had times when we&#39;ve had more money than we need, and<br/>
times when we didn&#39;t have enough to make ends meet.  No matter how much<br/>
money we have our first priority is spending time together.  A lot of people<br/>
say that, but when it comes time to choose a job or buy a car it&#39;s not<br/>
really the first factor they consider.  For us it is.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be happy to answer any other questions she had, or elaborate on that one<br/>
if she wants. ~Rue<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>**That IS how we afford it :o).  Well, a good example anyway.  We bought a<br/>
100+ year old house 5 1/2 years ago.  It had been on the market quite a<br/>
while (by which I mean it was relatively cheap :o)) because it needed a lot<br/>
of work. It still does :o).  We&#39;re doing it very slowly, both for financial<br/>
reasons and because if the choice one Saturday is &#39;paint the office&#39; or &#39;go<br/>
to the park with the kids because it ended up being a beautiful day&#39; we<br/>
choose to go to the park.  The office&#39;ll still be here when they&#39;re grown.<br/>
<br/>
The floors were mostly carpeted when we moved in and it was very dirty.  So<br/>
we ripped it all up and cleaned the floors underneath - some plywood, some<br/>
old hardwood with floor leveler, a couple of good hardwood floors - and have<br/>
been living with it that way ever since.  We&#39;re getting floors this winter<br/>
and I can hardly imagine what it&#39;ll be like!  Kelly and Ben are going to<br/>
come lay them with us, right Kelly? &lt;G&gt;  I don&#39;t think most people would<br/>
consider living with their floors this way an option, but for us it&#39;s a<br/>
matter of priorities.  ~Rue<br/>

bought were decent hardwood floors - except some prior yutz had <br/>
neglected to cover them properly when spraying the awful popcorn on <br/>
the ceiling (apologies to those who like popcorn textured ceilings). <br/>
So there are areas of white speckles all over. DH sanded the living <br/>
room with an orbital sander (several days of sitting on the floor <br/>
sanding) but we haven&#39;t sanded the rest yet and none is <br/>
refinished ... yet. We still have to pull up the carpet in our <br/>
bedroom and then we&#39;ll be carpet free. And it all started because DS <br/>
wanted his bedroom renovated - in pulling out his closets we had to <br/>
remove some carpeting and found the nice floor underneath and said <br/>
let&#39;s just chuck this ugly stuff totally. Completely changed the <br/>
feel of the whole house - much more open and free somehow. <br/>

Like our 2-week camping trip this summer... and people wondered why we  <br/>
didn&#39;t stay home and redo our bathroom (which is in dire need of repair...our  <br/>
shower wall has a gaping hole in it somewhat, temporarily patched, but camping  <br/>
was more fun and my kiddies are only this age once!)  <br/>

LUCKY! lol... the previous owner of this house abused it. The hardwood  <br/>
floors are warped, scratched, stained (He had left with the clothes on his back  <br/>
when we closed, so we had to move his stuff out. When we moved the couch, there  <br/>
was the largest, most disgusting pee stain, assuming from the dog they had. <br/>
The  cat he had, which he also left and we lovingly adopted, never peed <br/>
anywhere but  the litter box).  It&#39;s not even worth the time and energy to strip it <br/>
and  finish it. It needs replacing. But, we carpeted the two kids&#39; rooms.<br/>
Hindsight, 3 1/2 years later is, we should&#39;ve walked, or ran, from this  <br/>
place.  <br/>
