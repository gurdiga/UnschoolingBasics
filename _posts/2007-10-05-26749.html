<div id="ygrps-yiv-1086723041">I had a blog a few years back that I killed because I was posting mostly to my family blog. Lately I have had a bug to start up an unschool blog. It is really just for me to get some of the stuff in my brain out onto paper, but somebody might read it!<br/>
 <br/>
I was wondering if you have a an unschool blog. I was hoping to poke around and read a little. Even if I never get around to doing my own, I enjoy them for reading. And if I ever get a site up, I might make a blog role.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2119099398">There are tons of unschooling blogs out there - in my experience <br/>
though, most of them have lots of family stuff on them since <br/>
*everything* falls under unschooling. But it&#39;s nice to see the <br/>
perspective of unschoolers. Go here http://www.ringsurf.com/netring?<br/>
ring=Unschooling_Blogs;action=list  and you will find a list of links <br/>
to some unschooling blogs. Also, some other ones I like are:<br/>
http://radicalunschooling.blogspot.com/, <br/>
http://www.findingme.typepad.com/, http://no-assembly-<br/>
required.blogspot.com/, http://www.sandradodd.blogspot.com/ ... there <br/>
are tons more, too many to name! If you start one, make sure to let <br/>
us know so we can check it out!<br/>
