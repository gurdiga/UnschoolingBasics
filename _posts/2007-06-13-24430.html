<div id="ygrps-yiv-1290901195">Please respond to me personally, so we won&#39;t take up any more time <br/>
with this on this list.  <br/>
The reason I&#39;m asking here is because I feel that someone here will <br/>
have the answer I&#39;m looking for.  I couldn&#39;t find anything <br/>
online...it&#39;s hard to know what to search for...what search terms to <br/>
use.<br/>
Anyway...what I need...<br/>
Last week, or the week before, my BIL chased a stray dog from his <br/>
yard into our yard and shot it and killed it.  <br/>
I&#39;ve worked hard to make my yard a sanctuary...a peaceful place for <br/>
whatever comes into it, and it seems to me that he has destroyed that <br/>
peace.  The poor dog went as far as he could, up against the fence on <br/>
the far side of the yard, and then he couldn&#39;t get out.  I&#39;ve already <br/>
taken the fence down...there won&#39;t be another animal caught there. <br/>
 But I&#39;m thinking there must be some sort of cleansing ritual to <br/>
restore the peace to my yard?  Some sort of sprinkling or burning of <br/>
herbs?  The rain has washed away the blood, but still I feel it&#39;s <br/>
desecrated.  I *know* there&#39;s something to do...I&#39;m just not sure <br/>
what.  <br/>
TIA to anyone who can help...and please respond offlist.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1802828481">I think everyone could benefit from this so decided to respond here. Check<br/>
out &quot;The Smudging and Blessings Book&quot; by Jane Alexander. It describes native<br/>
american rituals using sage and other herbs to cleanse and heal spaces for a<br/>
large variety of reasons. I try and sage my house on a regular basis,<br/>
especially rooms before and after guests, if someone has been ill, if I&#39;m<br/>
having people over for dinner. Sometimes its as simple as buring incense and<br/>
other times more involved using sage and sweetgrass. Feel free to contact me<br/>
personally if you have any questions at all.<br/>

  Have you thought about putting up a fence on your BIL&#39;s side of your yard?  Some kind of protection for your sanctuary to keep that negative energy out would add to your peace of mind.  <br/>

I thought about a rose hedge, where, hopefully, animals could still <br/>
come through but he might be deterred.  I&#39;m not good with roses, <br/>
though, so I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll try it.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2051805385">m not good with roses either but we have quite a few (they came with the<br/>
house).  They are hardy plants.  Its mainly just the trimming and if you<br/>
keep that on a good schedule you would be fine.  If I can do it, anyone can!<br/>

  Roses make an uneven hedge, and there&#39;s the thorn issue, too. Maybe lilacs, or yewonomous -- we had those back east they were totally maintenance free and they could not be killed (believe me, I tried).  Shiny leaves, little white flowers and they grow like mad.<br/>
   <br/>
  Yeah, a hedge that allows the animals a hiding place in your yard and keeps your bil out might be just the thing.<br/>
