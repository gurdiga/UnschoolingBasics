<br/>
Yes. All the terms are only useful in discussion, irl I don&#39;t really<br/>
make a bunch of distinctions. It IS nice to hang out with RU&#39;rs<br/>
though...only because I can RELAX. I know they aren&#39;t going to judge<br/>
us harshly, I know we can be open about our lives (not that we ever<br/>
hide it) in a different way. It&#39;s great.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to know though, if you&#39;re respectfully parenting, why would<br/>
you make your child do schoolwork of any kind unless they asked for<br/>
it? Isn&#39;t respect about honoring the individual and not coercing anyone?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2095621688">Our home has been dramatically changed and call it backwards if you<br/>
will; but the radical parenting style as far as respecting the<br/>
children and their decisions has been easier than the whole<br/>
unschooling part.  <br/>
<br/>
Coming and observing the thoughts on this site regarding parenting and<br/>
treating children with respect has not only had a positive impact on<br/>
the children but also my hubby and I as parents.  We are much more<br/>
careful than we used to be, we discuss rather than punish, although if<br/>
they are arguing heavily we&#39;ll send them to their rooms in order to<br/>
cool off before we try and discuss what has happened.  <br/>
<br/>
This IS beginning to trickle down in the area of schooling now.  I too<br/>
am relaxed/eclectic and I&#39;m finding that the more I read and learn,<br/>
the more relaxed and eclectic I get.  Hollering at my son to the point<br/>
of tears for not doing his math right is but a distant memory.  I<br/>
don&#39;t grade the kids at all and both of them actually love learning. <br/>
By no means is it the way kids are learning at school.  My son is<br/>
reading Archimedes and the Door to Science and his retention of things<br/>
learned shows when he discussed, I&#39;m learning from him.  I&#39;ve never<br/>
seen him so excited over a book before!  HE has initiated experiments<br/>
because of this book.  My daughter is reading The Secret Garden and<br/>
has been inspired to have a flower garden.  Yesterday we went to<br/>
Walmart and she picked her own seeds and today we&#39;ll be starting them.<br/>
<br/>
So, I am by no means an unschooler yet although the positive<br/>
influences from here have touched my entire family and have in turn<br/>
created the absolute, most happiest time in our lives.<br/>

I agree, April.  Sometimes it is just the family needs and sometimes I  <br/>
realize that I&#39;ve been holding on to an old &quot;tape&quot;.  I didn&#39;t even realize  that my <br/>
thinking was still stuck in school mode and something will happen to  make me <br/>
aware of it.<br/>
 <br/>
****That&#39;s something I try to remember when I interact with  other<br/>
unschoolers who are at a different point in the process than I am.  It&#39;s<br/>
important to encourage each other to strive for more, but at the same  time,<br/>
to respect each family where they are on the journey. A fine line  <br/>
sometimes.*****<br/>
<br/>
I remember when I first started unschooling, my kids were little and  our <br/>
world was all about ABC&#39;s and 123&#39;s.  It didn&#39;t really look that  different from <br/>
a typical preschool/kindergarten experience.  In my mind,  unschooling <br/>
learning sometimes looks like school learning.  I said  something to that effect on <br/>
one of the boards and I got blasted!!  I was so  confused and got my feelings <br/>
hurt.  It would have been nice if someone had  said, &quot;yes, occasionally it does <br/>
happen that way, but sometimes it looks  absolutely nothing like school!&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
OK, that made no sense.  I&#39;m just agreeing with April!  :)<br/>

all deschool and take a BIG, MUCH NEEDED break right from the start and that led <br/>
on to unschooling. (I wish so badly that we would have done this from the <br/>
beginning! We are loving it) I can see the changes taking place in our whole <br/>
family almost on a daily basis.  It is a process, we are all at different places <br/>
in our lives with unschooling and I thank you for what you just said April, I <br/>
appreciate your respect and kindness.<br/>

&gt; learninginfreedom.com<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A couple reasons -- he gets bored and antsy without some direction.  <br/>
Some of it is stuff he asked to learn about, but he is the kind of <br/>
kid that likes goals.  We approach it, though, as a partnership.  <br/>
Often, I view us as co-learners, because I am filling in a number of <br/>
my own HUGE gaps.  Some of it, he is explaining to me, because, to <br/>
be honest, he is smarter than I am.  He does like to learn -- but <br/>
computer games are very enticing, too, and he would probably spend <br/>
15 hours a day playing Runescape.  (Hey, he needs to eat and sleep <br/>
some, too!)  <br/>
<br/>
I view it for our family, somewhat as the same as discipline.  The <br/>
goal of discipline isn&#39;t punishment, but to develop self-discipline, <br/>
so that when you need to do something, you can.  Or avoid doing <br/>
something, in some cases.  When my son was in school (through 5th <br/>
grade), he learned unintended lessons, one of which was to be <br/>
unfocused.  I only just realized this recently, through a discussion <br/>
with someone else, that it wasn&#39;t his natural inclination to <br/>
constantly daydream, but an effect of having been a disengaged <br/>
learner.  Even though the school (a small private school) TRIED to <br/>
enrich his curriculum, it wasn&#39;t right for him.  I know if it <br/>
weren&#39;t for the fact that the principal understood some of the <br/>
issues involved, the schools could easily have tried to slap the ADD <br/>
label on him.  The symptoms are very similar, but being bored out of <br/>
your mind is not the same cause, or cure.  I&#39;m delighted that my son <br/>
has figured out that he is a morning person (I knew for ages, but he <br/>
didn&#39;t accept it, and I didn&#39;t debate the point), and is now, with <br/>
the arrangement he initiated, developing (redeveloping, I suppose, <br/>
since he used to have it) focus.  <br/>
<br/>
Kids REALLY need to come with instruction manuals.  They are all so <br/>
unique, interesting, and the supposed guidelines are not much of a <br/>
guide sometimes, are they?  It&#39;s like when I have read discussions <br/>
and such on learning styles.  I really can&#39;t say what my son&#39;s <br/>
learning style is -- maybe multi-faceted.  I felt like a bad mom for <br/>
that.  (I felt like a bad mom when I hid the coloring books when he <br/>
was little, too.  Wouldn&#39;t color in them, but asked me to read them <br/>
to him.  Do you have any idea how BORING they are to read?  But his <br/>
view of books was, you read &#39;em.  Sigh.  Well, we are at a different <br/>
stage now.)<br/>
<br/>
My son is the kid who always asked me questions that I couldn&#39;t <br/>
answer, that both my base of knowledge and his were inadequate to <br/>
the explanations.  But he isn&#39;t self-propelled to gather the <br/>
knowledge on his own, never really has been.  (For an only child, he <br/>
is a very social learner!)  I think I need to get Steven Hawkings as <br/>
a mentor for him....<br/>

I suspect that, 5 yrs ago, I could never have envisioned what my <br/>
life right now would be like, and I have a hard (really really hard) <br/>
time grasping 5 yrs from now.  That would be the last of the teen <br/>
years for my son.... Gulp.<br/>

I don&#39;t for somethings, but I find the feedback of whether a problem <br/>
is right or wrong is useful in math and science (chem this year for <br/>
us.)  But I don&#39;t use A,B,C grading -- I figure we are going for <br/>
mastery, so if it is a C, it isn&#39;t mastered, and we don&#39;t move on, <br/>
therefore....  But my son is a real &quot;guy&quot; as far as numbers and <br/>
quantifying, so sometimes he likes that sort of thing, too.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I remember hating history when I was a kid -- names, dates, boring!<br/>
But my son is the one who asked to learn about WWII, and then the <br/>
Cold War, and next he wants to learn WWI -- all stuff I missed <br/>
through moves in school.  We are both learning so much, and really <br/>
enjoy our discussions of it.  The funniest thing was when we were <br/>
watching some WWII videos from the library -- they were made during <br/>
the war era for the new recruits.  It was SO weird for this cold war <br/>
child to watch these things saying things like, &quot;The Russian people <br/>
are fighting for their freedom...&quot;  And the Russians were shown <br/>
going to churches.  Yeah, Stalin was big on freedom and religion!  <br/>
And then similar with China.  Bizarre, but made an interesting <br/>
backdrop for discussion!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Very cool!  I&#39;ve worried about my son&#39;s reading -- the years of <br/>
school&#39;s reading requirements and reading incentive programs more or <br/>
less killed his love of reading that he started with. Then he was <br/>
always choosing to reread simple books (mind you, he is a very good <br/>
reader), etc.  I finally realized it is more a matter of finding the <br/>
right books for him.  He whipped through Digital Fortress within a <br/>
day or two -- and that is not a &quot;kid&quot; book.  But it had codes and <br/>
such, a keen interest of his.  Finding the books that will pull him <br/>
in is a tougher issue, though.  There just aren&#39;t too many on codes, <br/>
the enigma machine, fractals, or nebulous other interests.<br/>
