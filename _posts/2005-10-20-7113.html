<div id="ygrps-yiv-508922650">I hope you don&#39;t mind if I brag a bit... I&#39;m still in amazement myself. <br/>
 <br/>
Normally, if I start yakking about something my DH isn&#39;t 100% interested  in, <br/>
he sort of tunes me out. Now, where the kids are concerned, the &quot;technical&quot;  <br/>
stuff sometimes is over his head. So, sometimes I assume he&#39;s not paying  <br/>
attention. lol... boy, have I been wrong! Now, I know he&#39;s had his qualms over  <br/>
the homeschooling issue, the same typical concerns of the uninformed. And, of  <br/>
course, I&#39;ve always had an answer/solution/suggestion for those concerns. <br/>
 <br/>
Now, I&#39;ve been VERY VERY lucky in that, I have full support from his mom  and <br/>
my parents as well as some extended family members. The grandmothers have  <br/>
even expressed interest in being involved. So, we were on a mini-vacation with  <br/>
my mother-in-law this past weekend and the topic of homeschooling came up.  <br/>
Imagine my surprise and AWE when DH basically turned into the BIGGEST  <br/>
unschooling advocate! He does get it! LOL I had printed some things out and  stuck them <br/>
on the bathroom reading pile, and he has been reading it, I guess.  I&#39;m just <br/>
super happy that he&#39;s totally on the same page as me when I was  thinking we <br/>
were in two different books! LOL<br/>
 <br/>
Oh, and my mother-in-law is also on the same page (and she was a teacher  <br/>
once!).  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-69981847">Hi Jenny...isn&#39;t that a great feeling! :-) My husband is also on the <br/>
same page as I, and it makes it that much easier to unschool. You must <br/>
be so happy. :-)<br/>

It is so much easier. Kind of a relief, as I feel I don&#39;t have to &quot;justify&quot;  <br/>
my beliefs and feelings about it. <br/>
 <br/>
Coincidently, a funny conversation.. We were at Dunkin Donuts drive-through  <br/>
the other day, oh, about 10 or 11 am. The car in front of us had 2 women and a <br/>
 girl, I&#39;d say she was about 9 or 10. The car was an old beat up thing. DH <br/>
said,  &quot;I wonder why she&#39;s not in school?&quot; And I LOVE challenging him, it&#39;s like <br/>
a game  we play, so I came back with, &quot;Maybe she&#39;s homeschooled?&quot; DH then <br/>
says, &quot;They  don&#39;t LOOK like homeschoolers.&quot; And I said, &quot;Oh? What does a <br/>
homeschooler look  like? Do I look like a homeschooler?&quot; Mr. Smartie-Pants comes back <br/>
with, &quot;You  look beautiful and they don&#39;t look &quot;bright&quot; enough to do the <br/>
right thing.&quot;<br/>
I was LOL... LOL at his &quot;do the right thing&quot; comment... It was just too  cute <br/>
in the moment.  <br/>
