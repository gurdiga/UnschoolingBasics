<div id="ygrps-yiv-1134871890">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I have had numerous offlist conversations with people like myself who have 1 child in a school while unschooling other children at home. I have created a yahoo groups site to talk about the unique challenges our families face as we live an unschool lifestyle with school right in our homes. This is also a good place to get support if your unschooled child is curious about school.<br/>
<br/>
Web address is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingwithschool">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingwithschool</a><br/>
<br/>
This is the very first group I have ever started and I am newer than new as a moderator, so any wise help offers are welcome.<br/>
