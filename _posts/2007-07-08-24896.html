<br/>
Tooting my own horn, I suppose.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; We&#39;ve found that when they &quot;act up,&quot; they are in need of re-<br/>
 </span></blockquote>connecting with<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; us. Sometimes being playful is required, sometimes reflecting,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>sometimes<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; just being near, depending upon the situation.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;TA DA!<br/>
&gt;That&#39;s a really lovely reframing of the idea that &quot;kids act up to<br/>
&gt;get attention&quot;. Very positive spin on that old saw - I like that. I<br/>
&gt;find it really useful, talking with my conventional parenting<br/>
&gt;friends, to be able to re-state those sorts of truisms from a<br/>
&gt;different perspective.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve recently found myself talking with a couple other parents about some<br/>
tough &quot;parenting situations&quot; we each have encountered.  The one I remember<br/>
most was a buddy of mine giving me the classic &quot;time out&quot; scenario for being<br/>
bad (his ds is 2, gimme a break), or a &quot;No way am I gonna lose this battle<br/>
of wills.&quot;  Usually I just nod my head and smile nervously.  This time I<br/>
told him point-blank that DW and I have embarked on what is probably a very<br/>
different view of discipline and interacting with our children.  To his<br/>
credit, he actually appeared to listen.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t give him the whole spiel.  Heck, I&#39;m not sure what the whole spiel<br/>
is.  I did tell him two things, though.  In Alfie Kohn&#39;s &quot;Unconditional<br/>
Parenting,&quot; in response to the classic &quot;What&#39;s WRONG with you?  Are you deaf<br/>
or something?!&quot;  Kohn would just love for the child to respond, &quot;NO, I&#39;m<br/>
THREE!&quot;  That was good for a chuckle, and hopefully it stuck.  Humor can do<br/>
that.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
The second thing I told him was in response to the parent who does nothing<br/>
when his/her kid is &quot;behaving badly,&quot; say at a party or at dinner, or<br/>
something else.  The &quot;permissive, I&#39;m-your-buddy parent.&quot;  IThe situation<br/>
needs to be addressed.  Just differently than what most parents do.  When<br/>
that happens, especially with dd2, she has some need that has to be met.<br/>
Sleep, food, a re-connect with us, something.  Of course, we need to ensure<br/>
that dd2 stops pummeling Timmy.  However, the &quot;solution&quot; is not a time-out<br/>
in the popular sense, or spanking, or a good yelling at.  Our parenting<br/>
culture is so behavior-based that it treats the kids like pets.  If they&#39;re<br/>
acting up, there&#39;s something going on inside their heads.  That needs to be<br/>
addressed.  And yes, sometimes it&#39;s mind-reading, but you get better at it.<br/>
And you start treating your kid as a person, not a pet.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, one other thing.  When you&#39;re &quot;enforcing justice,&quot; i.e. &quot;I&#39;m taking that<br/>
toy away from you because you took it from Timmy,&quot; or whatever it may be --<br/>
(some may disagree with me here, but ) not only is it being hypocritical to<br/>
take a toy away and say &quot;don&#39;t take things,&quot; but the other &quot;lesson&quot; she may<br/>
learn is that &quot;Daddy can be a real butthead.&quot;  I&#39;m not the Enforcer of<br/>
Justice or the Arbiter of Fairness.  If my actions put her on the short end<br/>
of the stick, then I&#39;m the Bad Man.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t know how he took it all. Maybe he won&#39;t invite us over to his place<br/>
after all.  We&#39;ll see.  But it&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve felt comfortable<br/>
re-framing a common situation with a different perspective.  Both parents<br/>
are really good people.  They just emphasize the &quot;carrot&quot; side of the<br/>
behavior-focused coin.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Enough self-aggrandizement.  Anyone else done any &quot;proselytizing&quot; out there?<br/>

It&#39;s a fine-line to walk because I probably would have about 1/2 the<br/>
friends we have if I said what I really want to say. But I figure the<br/>
best thing is to just keep treating my family the way I do and let<br/>
them extract their own information from the situation. <br/>
<br/>
I only mention it if they bring it up usually. Or if a situation is<br/>
obvious enough that I can gently intervene with a &quot;that&#39;s perfectly<br/>
alright, he&#39;s just being curious&quot; or some other phrase that let&#39;s the<br/>
parent know I think everything is ok.<br/>
<br/>
We tend to hang out with folks that are non-punitive with their<br/>
children....we&#39;ve been fortunate to find friends who care about being<br/>
gentle and respectful, even if we don&#39;t agree on other topics.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I must say that I am the only one in my family of 8 kids who is <br/>
practicing any kind of unschooling/unconditional parenting sort of <br/>
thing and on the one hand it is getting hard to be around my family <br/>
when they treat their kids so harshly. The kids are making <br/>
reasonable requests or just acting like kids and they get punished <br/>
or shamed. I have started to speak up- telling about how wrong it is <br/>
to let children &quot;cry it out&quot; how it effects them as adults or how <br/>
wrong &quot;time out &quot; is. But recently I have been connecting to the <br/>
children- talking to them, asking questions, listening to them. It <br/>
is amazing to see a kids eyes light up when you activitly engage <br/>
them. Maybe I can show them a different way. Then again I do not <br/>
punish my kids for wanting or expressing needs and always ask what <br/>
they want on their plate and what they need. Most of all I ask them <br/>
not tell them. My family already thinks I am the weird one anyway <br/>
(leaving the family religion and so forth) so I figure why not let <br/>
them in on parenting as well.<br/>
<br/>
The great thing is that my mom has noticed that parents are harsh <br/>
and that she can see the fear in the kids eyes. Sad. so sad. One <br/>
family at a time and we can maybe someday change the culture of <br/>
parenting.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1258058393">I&#39;ve had those conversations, too. But I find myself taking action, by pulling away from friends and family who practice punitive measures with children, lately. They don&#39;t &#39;get&#39; my way, and I feel accausted by theirs. I have this strong visceral reaction when I see what appears to be injustice. And silence doesn&#39;t suit me, so I withdraw instead. <br/>
  I&#39;ve worried lately that I&#39;m being intolerant, by pulling away. That I&#39;m acting as if I judge them. I think I withdraw out of self-preservation, more than anything. (Childhood didn&#39;t agree with me...even my Mom agrees I have PTSD from it!)  <br/>
  Anyway, blah,blah,blah...me,me,blah...blah, blah,blah,blah,me,me,blah!<br/>
