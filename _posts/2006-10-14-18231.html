<div id="ygrps-yiv-1799842148">May I please share an experience my son, his soccer team, and I shared <br/>
this afternoon?  My little boy (6)is an EXTREMELY emotional/feeling-<br/>
type soul!  I LOVE him with my whole being!  Today was the first day of <br/>
soccer.  ...long story/short, the coach asked DS to pick a number <br/>
between 1 and 5.  He said 3 and a half!  I thought it was brilliant!  <br/>
Guess what?  Everyone (including myself) laughed.  It was a GREAT <br/>
answer, right?  How many of us would have said a whole number, not a <br/>
fraction!?  Well, he broke in tears.  My angel.  Imagine the grief a <br/>
school setting would provide for this sensitive, brilliant boy.  His <br/>
brilliance most probably would be caged/boxed up and rarely able to <br/>
shine.  Bless his tiny heart.  How many other brilliant, sensitive <br/>
types are out there experiencing this same thing in a school setting?  <br/>
When we snuggle up tonight for our bedtime routine, we&#39;ll talk more <br/>
about what all that meant to him.  He has been unschooled from birth <br/>
and is the light of my life.</div>

I loved his answer.  How brilliant was that?!!!  I am<br/>
glad he has the creativity to answer a question in<br/>
whole numbers and fractions.  Making someone laugh is<br/>
an awesome gift.  He sounds very special.  He has what<br/>
I am trying to give back to my kids, since they were<br/>
in public schools for 4 and 5 years.  They have<br/>
somewhat lost their ability to shine.  <br/>
