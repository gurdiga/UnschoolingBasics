<div id="ygrps-yiv-1253866684">&lt;&lt;Oh, and for the frustrated mother who listed the above issues describing her <br/>
son--try hugging him everytime you or he gets frustrated.  It works 95% of the <br/>
time with William.  Comfort is a wonderful tool, regardless of the problem or <br/>
issue.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I try to, Robin.  More than I used to, that&#39;s for sure.  He always pulls away.  Dakari does not enjoy intimate physical contact like that.  If I go to hug him he will pull away.  He&#39;s done that since he was born.  Hey, he&#39;s just not comfortable with it.  But I keep doing it anyway.  If for no other reason to show him that I love him.<br/>
<br/>
LOL - my husband, well, he&#39;s a different story.  He doesn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; Dakari at all.  And if you think MY statements weren&#39;t unschooly enough, then you&#39;ll cringe at his.  For example: Dakari loves to carry his bookbag wherever he goes.  Not my cup of tea, but Dakari isn&#39;t hurting anyone, and it brings him joy.  My husband did not like it at all.  I told him it&#39;s normal and lots of kids carry something around with them all the time.  One day he may grow out of it, or maybe not.  I asked him why he carries it around, he said it makes him feel like he&#39;s going to school (my kids were in school for 5 months this year).  Maybe it&#39;s a sense of stability, maybe it&#39;s just fun for him....whatever.  <br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m working on more hugs for everyone in my house.  Hugs are therapeutic.  In my opinion hugs and water can cure just about anything.<br/>

&quot;Don&#39;t be afraid of showing affection. Be warm and tender, thoughtful and affectionate. Mankind is more helped by sympathy than by service. Love is more than money, and a kind word will give more pleasure than a present.&quot; <br/>

<br/>
For a long time, when Dylan was younger he was Mrs. Quarks and he wore a<br/>
string shopping bag on his head like a hair net, tied in the back like a<br/>
pony tail.  He wore it everywhere.  Sometimes he&#39;d wear his green afghan<br/>
pinned round his neck for a cape.  But Mrs. Quarks was with us for a very<br/>
long time and she always wore the shopping bag.  &lt;g&gt;   She suffered from<br/>
a disease called Kirksagerkus and so would announce sometimes, loudly, in<br/>
the store or Post Office (where it echoed)  &quot;I can feel it, the end is<br/>
near!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He would wrap a stuffed animal or six up in his baby quilt and sometime<br/>
the afghan too (if it wasn&#39;t round his neck) and carry it with him.  It<br/>
was his &quot;bundle of snuggles.&quot;   He was nine, I think before he stopped<br/>
taking it into stores and he still slept with it until he was eleven or<br/>
twelve. <br/>
<br/>
Dylan tucked his pant legs into his socks and it bugged dh David.  I<br/>
don&#39;t know why, I guess he thought people would think less of him if his<br/>
kid was weird. &lt;g&gt;  He did that until he was about eight or nine.  <br/>
<br/>
Dylan wore his clothes inside out because he hated the feel of the seems<br/>
and tags.  I think he did that until he was eight or so.  Then, gradually<br/>
he got used to the seems.  Tags still bother him so we buy tagless or cut<br/>
them out.  Tags bug dh too. <br/>
<br/>
His favorite game was a game of imagination that he played out in his<br/>
head while pacing back and forth on the front lawn, holding a strand of<br/>
his long hair and wiggling it violently while he made explosion noises<br/>
(you know the kind of spitty, phkhh! noise?)  He paced all the grass away<br/>
and there is still a divot by the front door where he would land after<br/>
jumping from the top step.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could show your husband this post and then Dakari&#39;s book bag<br/>
will seem perfectly ok to him!   Sometimes I think we project our kids<br/>
into the future as they are now, but they will be different people in ten<br/>
years, in twenty.  They will want different things for themselves.  They<br/>
will move on from where they are today, like all of us will. <br/>
<br/>
Dylan will be fourteen in two and a half weeks.  He carries a pocket<br/>
knife and wallet now instead of his bundle of snuggles.  He wears funky<br/>
hemp hats sometimes instead of string shopping bags and capes.   All his<br/>
clothes are worn right side out and most of them make some kind of<br/>
political statement. (Jon Stewart for President) &lt;g&gt;  No more pants<br/>
tucked into socks.   <br/>

&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
***Hey, he&#39;s just not comfortable with it.  But I keep doing it anyway. <br/>

<br/>
Lots of people are comforted by the touch of someone they love but if you<br/>
know he&#39;s not then it would be kinder to stop.  <br/>
<br/>
If you had a good friend who kissed you on the mouth every time you met,<br/>
and the kissing made you uncomfortable, would it feel loving to you if,<br/>
after you said &quot;please don&#39;t&quot; your friend kept doing it?   <br/>
<br/>
Respecting Dakari&#39;s feelings is also a way to show love. <br/>
<br/>
There are other ways to be intimate and close.  Maybe you could lay down<br/>
beside him at night, not touching him, and in the dark, talk quietly<br/>
about when he was a baby.  You could tell him what it felt like to be<br/>
expecting him, and how you felt the first time you saw his little face. <br/>
You could talk about how you would hold and rock him and kiss his toes. <br/>
He might like to hear about all that love that was his right from the<br/>
beginning and that could a way to be close to him, conveying love while<br/>
respecting his need to not be touched. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s just one idea, it might not work for him, but it&#39;s an example of<br/>
closeness without touching. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Speaking as one who is uncomfortable with touch, you really should <br/>
find other ways to show love.  Suppose you played a game with <br/>
him...gave him of your time...brought him a gift...helped him, <br/>
working closely beside him while he picked up his toys...played in <br/>
the dirt with him...brought him a special snack while he was <br/>
watching tv....<br/>
Maybe he will initiate a hug if you did something like that, instead <br/>
of just hugging him.  I know I am a lot more likely to hug my poor <br/>
dh (who can&#39;t understand WHY I don&#39;t like to be touched) if he has <br/>
done something special for me. <br/>

and I have relatively small feet (size 7 generally) so it works out <br/>
great. I&#39;ve used foot rubs as a way to help DS wind down since he was <br/>
little (he&#39;s almost 8 now). Now he&#39;ll ask for one if he needs it and <br/>
sometimes he even asks if I want one and he&#39;ll rub my feet. The way I <br/>
look at it, he&#39;s getting great training for when he gets married - his <br/>
wife will definitely get great foot and back rubs. lol<br/>
