<div id="ygrps-yiv-1200544977">&lt;&lt;&lt;Were these people unschooled as children?  Or were their lives and <br/>
their passions stifled by school and the built in limits it imposed?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This puts a double-blind on the argument.<br/>
<br/>
If a poster states concerns about a certain type of behavior, they are questioned if they know someone like that.<br/>
<br/>
When they state yes they do, they are questioned if that person was unschooled.<br/>
<br/>
The number of adults who have been unschooled is so small that most people do not know any so they are unable to state how they view those people.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s an important distinction though, especially on an unschooling <br/>
list.  I was a voracious reader as a child, and I mostly read to <br/>
escape or to de-stress from the intensity of the school day.  It was <br/>
my haven, really.  And when I had a school vacation I&#39;m sure I spent <br/>
most of it reading.  Does anyone remember the part in A Tree Grows <br/>
in Brooklyn where the little girl can&#39;t wait until Saturday so she <br/>
can sit on the fire escape with her peppermint candy and read <br/>
uninterrupted all day?  That was me.<br/>
But if I was unschooled and had a rich life *outside* of reading <br/>
that I didn&#39;t need to escape from it would have been a whole new <br/>
context.  I probably would still have loved reading, but my need to <br/>
do so wouldn&#39;t have been so desperate and my motivations would have <br/>
been different.  Not to mention the fact that &quot;unlimited access&quot; <br/>
can&#39;t accurately describe a child in school and grappling with <br/>
homework as well.  How &quot;unlimited&quot; can his time really be?<br/>

Perhaps your motivations would have been different but you can&#39;t say that your behavior would have been.  You may guess that it might have been but you can&#39;t say for sure.  You weren&#39;t unschooled as a child.<br/>

<br/>
I didn&#39;t say that my behavior would have been different, I said my <br/>
reasons and motivations for reading would have been different.  If I <br/>
had had a happy, unschooled childhood I certainly wouldn&#39;t have <br/>
needed an escape from it.<br/>
I don&#39;t need to have been an unschooled child to know that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1891680876">Dear lists,<br/>
<br/>
sorry for this mass-list-mailing – but this video is just incredible,  <br/>
I love it, and I want to share it with everyone :-) It&#39;s a bit off- <br/>
topic, but does fit anyway - you&#39;ll see. The text below the video is  <br/>
just the translation into German, so don&#39;t spoil it for you by  <br/>
reading it first!<br/>

<br/>
Greetings from Germany and sorry to those who&#39;ve got this twice or  <br/>
three times.<br/>

Liebe Listen,<br/>
<br/>
entschuldigt das Massenmailing, aber dieses Video ist einfach  <br/>
unglaublich! Ich find&#39;s sooo toll, ich muss es mit allen teilen :-)  <br/>
Es ist ein bisschen off-topic, aber irgendwie passt es trotzdem – ihr  <br/>
werden schon sehen. Der Text unten drunter ist die Übersetzung, also  <br/>
an alle die, die Englisch können: nicht lesen! Sonst ruiniert ihr den  <br/>
Überraschungseffekt und die anderen, versucht zu lesen, während es  <br/>
läuft ganz langsam :-)<br/>

Liebe Grüße aus Leipzig und sorry an alle, die diese Nachricht nun  <br/>
zwei oder drei Mal erhalten haben!<br/>
