<div id="ygrps-yiv-443584304">First of all- I&#39;m cross posting this at Always Unschooled and <br/>
Unschooling Basics just so you know. <br/>
<br/>
  Video Game Joy here now!   Well, I just wanted to say that we, no &quot;I&quot; <br/>
have seen the light about how cool video games can be. I never really <br/>
played them growing up (we had an Atari that I sometimes used to play <br/>
Frogger or Pac Man, that&#39;s it).  Ds, 8 has really been into computer <br/>
games the last year or two, playing stuff like Civilization & Roman <br/>
Empire.  He started asking for a playstation after using the <br/>
neighbors.  At that point, we didn&#39;t even have a TV (hadn&#39;t had one for <br/>
4 years or so, left it behind when we moved into our solar powered home <br/>
to save power). <br/>
<br/>
  But we decided to go for it, get a TV, get Direct TV, and get the <br/>
playstation for Christmas.  We are so psyched!  I am LOVING having TV <br/>
again, which suprises me SO much since I typically used to read <br/>
whenever dh was watching TV before.  Now honestly, I need a break from <br/>
reading every night (plus I think I&#39;ve read everything I want to from <br/>
our small rural library that doesn&#39;t do interlibrary loan!).  It&#39;s been <br/>
a lot of fun for us to watch TV at night when the kids are in bed (they <br/>
prefer to head to bed early)- even if we do wind up watching reruns of <br/>
Law & Order most night, not reruns to us since we haven&#39;t seen any of <br/>
them:) <br/>
<br/>
  So, we love the playstation- I can actually play the LEGO games with <br/>
both kids.  I think we might look for a Wii next year too, it looks <br/>
really cool and would be fun to do together.  Right now we take turns <br/>
doing 2 player games together.  I wish we had done this sooner... the <br/>
kids are really enjoying having access to Nick and Disney (dd, 6) and <br/>
History & Discovery (ds, 8), plus the playstation.  AND- even though <br/>
some days they play it alot or watch a lot of TV, they still want to do <br/>
arts and crafts, walk the dogs, ski in the woods, etc, so all that <br/>
worrying I was doing was for nothing really....<br/>
<br/>
  OK, I have a question about the Nintendo DS- my dd, 6 has a hard time <br/>
playing the playstation games- she picked out a princess one and <br/>
strawberry shortcake, but has difficulty moving the character and <br/>
finding the &quot;clues&quot; in the games, plus her brother uses it much more <br/>
often than she does.  We are thinking of getting her a DS to use with <br/>
her own &quot;girl games&quot; (she calles them that).  But I want to know if the <br/>
DS is easier to use with the way it&#39;s designed and if the games are <br/>
easier, or less involved than the ps2 games.  She is interested in the <br/>
littlest pet shop game so far.  She does use the computer for games <br/>
like Dora and Jumpstart where you mostly just point and click with the <br/>
mouse.<br/>
<br/>
  It&#39;s been good for &quot;me&quot; to read the recent threads about gaming & I&#39;m <br/>
so excited that we decided to add these new things to our lives!   Of <br/>
course, now we really need more sunny days to up our power supply!   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1971111346">Both of my younger kids have had the DS since they were 4 or 5... I<br/>
think they handled those better than playing the Playstation at a<br/>
younger age.   One thing that I have always reminded my kids of when<br/>
they get frustrated with any type of game is that playing games is<br/>
like learning a sport or anything else you have to practice and doing<br/>
it perfectly or just right doesn&#39;t just happen normally the first<br/>
time.   I try to help them understand that the fun is playing it again<br/>
and again until you get better and better at it.    Now at ages 13 and<br/>
7 they are so thrilled to come tell me they are now at level 10 or<br/>
whatever in their games.   They love to take the DS along in the car<br/>
or whenever we have to wait somewhere. I really think younger kids<br/>
like the DS because it&#39;s small and just theirs... it&#39;s sure made alot<br/>
of long waits and long trips more pleasant!  <br/>
<br/>
We also have a Gamecube, Playstation , Playstation 2 and now a Wii and<br/>
they are my biggest video gamers... my older two play here and there<br/>
but aren&#39;t that into it and never have been.    Each of them have<br/>
certain types of games that they seem to be better at than others.   <br/>
We are all enjoying the Wii as a family though so I highly recommend that!<br/>

We&#39;re having so much fun trying to win the levels together. It&#39;s a<br/>

we all have to be learning something. LOLOL The real challenge will be<br/>
learning how to stop playing this game long enough to do some laundry<br/>
around here. *totally sucked in*** LOLOL<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1040372790">In some ways the DS is easier - among other things, a DS Lite (Same<br/>
abilities, slightly smaller footprint fits smaller hands better) has a<br/>
bit more &quot;natural&quot; feel to it because you often are using the stylus to<br/>
point to things, move things, pick up things, etc. If you&#39;ve got a game<br/>
place like GameStop in your area, you can pick them up used for a good<br/>
bit less than new but still in good condition (and if it does glitch on<br/>
you, they&#39;re really good about taking it back). I&#39;d say go for it - and<br/>
if it turns out not a good fit, GameStop type places will &quot;buy&quot; them<br/>
back, usually in store credit but that&#39;s stuff you can use to get other<br/>
games for your existing console.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-167812886">LOL videogames help DH stay sane while he&#39;s doing laundry - he puts a<br/>
load in the washer, games until he gets to a save point AND the wash is<br/>
done, saves, pauses, wash into dryer/new load into washer, back to<br/>
game...we have the PS2 often hooked up in the finished area of the<br/>
basement so he doesn&#39;t need to go up and down stairs - we even have a<br/>
mini fridge down there for keeping water bottles cool and storing<br/>
snacks. Alas, during the winter we don&#39;t like leaving the game system<br/>
down there so he does go up and down stairs but still times the gaming -<br/>
if the wet clothes have to wait 2 minutes before going in the dryer, it<br/>
hasn&#39;t seemed to hurt them any.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1968567029">Spore is an awesome game.  I&#39;ve gone through it a few times and made a bunch of characters/creations.  I&#39;ve been an herbavore, omnivore, and carnivore.  I&#39;ve been to space a much of times, terraformed planets, but I&#39;ve never completely finished the space age just because it became redundant to me.  But, the first few ages are a lot of fun!<br/>
