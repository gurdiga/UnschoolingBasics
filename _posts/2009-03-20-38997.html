<div id="ygrps-yiv-673625779">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Join Carolina Homeschooler this September as we make our fourth trip to <br/>
Disney World! We&#39;ll explore theme parks, splash in water parks, play virtual <br/>
reality games at Disney Quest, and participate in special educational <br/>
programs and group activities - all at great discounts. To make the deal<br/>
even sweeter, we&#39;re hopeful that Disney will offer their free dining again <br/>
this year. We&#39;d love to see you there!<br/>
<br/>
