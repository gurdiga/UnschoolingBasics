<div id="ygrps-yiv-1525974421">I am currently planning our wedding for NEXT MONTH, and have pretty <br/>
much nothing done.  I&#39;ve picked the honeymoon destination and <br/>
researched that, but that&#39;s it!  We&#39;ve been together for almost 10 <br/>
years, and we have seven children.  Yeah, I know...me plan a <br/>
wedding?  Well, anyway, the job is upon me, and I need some <br/>
resources.<br/>
<br/>
I have a catalog that has a beautiful Guinevere style dress that I&#39;d <br/>
like to wear.  No, I haven&#39;t ordered it yet.  The catalog is &quot;The <br/>
Pyramid Collection&quot;, and there is also a man&#39;s style poet&#39;s shirt <br/>
that I&#39;d like for Pat.  My dilemma is that we need shoes for both of <br/>
us that fit the attire and pants for Pat as well.  I was thinking <br/>
maybe moccassins, but have not found any in black for men.  I was <br/>
also thinking the baggy, drawstring style pants in black for Pat.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know of an Online company that I could find these <br/>
things, or do you have any suggestions as to other ideas?  I am of <br/>
Irish descent and really want to incorporate that in our wedding.  <br/>
It is going to be VERY small.  Our children, parents and a few close <br/>
couples will be the only people in attendance.  I may have the <br/>
children be our wedding party, and my grandpa is going to walk me <br/>
down the aisle.<br/>
<br/>
Any resources in this process would be GREATLY appreciated...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks - Tina</div>

Find your local SCA group.  There will surely be someone there (or someone<br/>

like.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sca.org/findsca.html">http://sca.org/findsca.html</a>  The SCA is an invaluable resource for<br/>

Seven children in 10 years?  I am impressed.  Congratulation on your<br/>

next weekend.  This weekend is already booked.  Thanks for the idea!  <br/>
I&#39;d not thought of it otherwise.  I can&#39;t wait!  I&#39;ve always wanted to <br/>
go, and now I have a good reason.  Sorry that we will be missing the <br/>
