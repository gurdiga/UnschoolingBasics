<div id="ygrps-yiv-1141049525">This is just totally crazy how people can get off by writing crap they know nothing about and wanting to change laws.  I saw this last night and was just like oh my.  It reminds me the time that the homeschooled boy shoot and killed his gf parents and the talk we all got because of homeschooling....  That is what actually turned my hubby around from sending our kids back to a ps system ever.  My oldest was actually made fun of in the PS system by a PS teacher.  We had thought about homeschooling but hadnt at that point cause really we needed me to work as I am a Nurse and made more then he did in wages.  When that happened though and the teacher admitted to doing it and saw nothing wrong with making fun of him.  Which really made me mad because my son has NO handicap at all he is a normal bright child she just didnt like the clothes he wore and how he looked because he is a big boy exp...  He is 12 years old, he wears a size 13 shoe and is about 5&#39;4&quot; and weighs around 150<br/>
 lbs.  He was a straight A student and loves school of all things but she made him hate it.  She would say stuff to him in front of the whole class.  He is fat and ugly and stupid and you name it.  I was furious.  I did whatI could to protect him and to actually take her job cause I guess he wasnt the first or he last she did this to.  No one listened but once I made a stink she is now no longer there as other parents stepped up after I did...  So it took like 2 years before they got rid of her.  But anyway the shootings and everything is just too much for me to handle in the PS system.  Send my child to school where they are to be safe but yet then you never know if  you will see them again due to all the killings they have been having.  My husband starting watching in our town alone these are just a few of the incidents....<br/>
  1. THe blacks and Mexicans had a gang bang from one school to the other and they hit and beat anyone in between them...<br/>
   <br/>
  2. They teach sex ed in kindergarten without parents concent<br/>
   <br/>
  3.  The highschool has a day care for the teen moms attending school.  We counted one day just at one hs and there was 25 babies in a stroller....<br/>
   <br/>
  4. Forcing kids to believe in evolution....  I dont throw my religion in their face dont throw evolution in my kids face.....<br/>
   <br/>
  5.  My youngest son they would have on all kinds of meds cause of his hyperactivity...<br/>
   <br/>
  6.  A science experiment was done with the kids testing their blood and they all used the same needle to poke themselves......<br/>
   <br/>
  Of course these are just a few of the incidents but hello it was enough for my hubby to be totally supportive of homeschooling/unschooling our children....<br/>
   <br/>
  We actually have unschooled just never knew there was a name for it hehehe....  We dont use curriculiams although I have some books for reference.  The kids pick and choose what they want to do when they want to do....  And the reason we do it this way is because if it is my idea my youngest son wont do it he will be off out the door and down the street with me chasing him.  So since it is his idea its great cause we have never had the problem of him running off like that again....   I love it...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2050736878">Jen on another list wrote a reply to it lets restrict public schooling ......she gave her permission to post it over here .............<br/>
   <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;&gt;With varying degrees of red-tape, public schooling is compulsory in<br/>
 </span></blockquote>each and every one of our 50 states.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously there were and are political reasons for this. Lots of<br/>
public-schooling parents are bi-partisan. Bi-partisanists are easily<br/>
led, and they vote.<br/>
<br/>
But as to other reasons for this blanket surrender to public school<br/>
advocates- I for one, have never understood why.<br/>
<br/>
Of course I know that our home school families are plagued by<br/>
problems, but I have to think that through time- even now- our<br/>
families have nurtured millions of solid citizens. And surely, our<br/>
private schools have nurtured and produced millions more of our best<br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not blind to the fact that many solid citizens have been<br/>
public-schooled. I&#39;ve even heard of public schoolers winning science<br/>
fairs, and being accepted to prestigious colleges. Because I admit<br/>
that public schooling works in some cases, I don&#39;t view myself as a<br/>
bigot in that regard.<br/>
<br/>
Still, when I look at the bigger picture, I am far from assured that<br/>
the blanket legal compulsion of public-schooling serves society too well.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m troubled by the fact that a significant percentage of public<br/>
schooling parents choose this option because of an overriding feeling<br/>
that they cannot provide their children with a solid education, simply<br/>
because they, themselves, were public-schooled.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder how many of these types of public-schooled kids take the<br/>
assumptions of say, reading as something only experts can teach, and<br/>
school as the only place learning takes place, and other lack of<br/>
respect for scientific and intellectual inquiry into adulthood. Will<br/>
these people be on equal preparatory footing for jobs where scientific<br/>
inquisitiveness, technical insight or critical thinking skills are far<br/>
more necessary than rote recitation?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also troubled, frankly, by parents who find the world overly<br/>
complex, and want to keep their students squirreled away in same-age<br/>
classes, away from the real world, in the service of simplicity and<br/>
protectiveness.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m equally troubled by the fact that a non-trivial number of<br/>
public-schoolers are taught in that way because their parents are<br/>
self-centered consumers who lack the impulse or skills to mix in as<br/>
collaborative members of everyday society--even with their own offspring.<br/>
<br/>
Well, the world is overly complex. Lots of different types of people,<br/>
of cultural forces. Hiding off in an age-segregated classroom and<br/>
teaching kids away from the influence of a socially formative<br/>
community environment can make it harder for your children to learn<br/>
about the give-and-take of life in our present-day culture.<br/>
<br/>
Listen, I am not advocating that public-schooling should be outlawed.<br/>
Of course there should be exemptions- where the neighborhood has a<br/>
school as a collaborative effort, when the child isn&#39;t able to<br/>
tolerate diverse groups and stimulation, where the family lives in a<br/>
geographically dense area. In these cases- and when teachers are<br/>
professionally trained as a qualified parent is available- sure,<br/>
public schooling would be OK.<br/>
<br/>
But as to the public schooler subjected to beliefs that run counter to<br/>
scientific inquiry and the principles in which knowledge is pursued<br/>
and attained- I say don&#39;t send them to school unless there&#39;s a course<br/>
of study they can&#39;t find in their own community.<br/>
<br/>
But if the public-schooler comes home saying:<br/>
&quot;School is the only place where learning takes place,&quot; or, &quot;My teacher<br/>
says you have to go to school to learn to read,&quot; then we&#39;ve lost the<br/>
intellectual war to a degenerate system with a captive audience.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-530857924">I knew the family that was involved in the killing back in 2005. It was a horrible time. <br/>
Believe me homeschooling had nothing to do with it. The young girl involved was a sneak and a liar. My daughter was friends with her for a short time until I could see that she was manipulative and sneaky. She had snuck this boy into her room right behind her families back, while they were asleep,  on more then one occasion. Did she learn this from homeschooling? I don&#39;t think so. Was the boyfriend mentally unstable because he was homeschooled? Of course not. There were so many factors in this case, but for some reason the homescholing part is what always made it into the news.<br/>
I got so sick of the accusations that were flying around about homeschoolers and that most are not wrapped right. The newspaper website out here had a field day with it as well.<br/>
There have been countless public school threats here, as well as real tragedies  here and elsewhere. I couldn&#39;t be happier with my decision to keep my kids home. Let small minded people think what they will. It doesn&#39;t matter where you live or if kids are homeschooled, unschooled, public, private, whatever. The method of teaching has nothing to do with how a kid turns out mentally.<br/>

<br/>
Method of teaching can greatly affect mental health. I&#39;ve been witness<br/>
to it countless times. The damage produced by overly controlling<br/>
parents and schooling isn&#39;t as apparent in some kids, but it&#39;s still<br/>
damaging them.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t a teaching method. It isn&#39;t a schooling method.<br/>
Unschooling is saying that there is no need for a method of any<br/>
kind...that humans learn just fine without any of that bullcrap.<br/>

  I&quot;m with Ren.  I think overly controlling homeschooling can (and does) affect a child/person&#39;s mental health, and overall character.  I know of one local family -- the Mom is very controlling, a real micro-manager. They use Well-Trained Mind, tho I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s because she&#39;s a control-freak that she chose that curriculum.  One of her sons is just about he meanest, sneakiest child I&#39;ve ever seen. Perfectly able to put on the sweetest face for almost anyone, but turn your back and he and his best friend (a kid whose Mom vaccilates between benign neglect and over-control) are  terrorizing every smaller child within sight.  It&#39;s ugly. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-470257034">After I wrote that, I did stop and think about some of the other homeschoolers we have been involved with in the past. It is true that there are alot of control freaks out there and I have seen the results of how some of these kids ended up. <br/>
It was a shame to see how many of my kids friends were sheltered to the point of not being able to go to the bathroom without their parent&#39;s permission. Well, not really, but you get the point. It is even worse to see how some of them turned out. I was the one who was always looked down on for being divorced, an unschooler, and let my kids dress and where their hair any way they wanted to. I am not bragging here or even saying OMG my kids are perfect. But in the end my 22 year old is straight edge, works with mentally retarded adults and is in a serious relationship. My 16 year old is also straight edge, which by the way wasn&#39;t my doing, they decided this all on their own, makes jewelry to sell at a monthly market and met a boy that lives 5 hours away 2 years ago, but both have worked to keep the relationship going. He is moving here in August to go to college and eventually ask my daughter to marry him. <br/>
So after my being pretty much shunned along with my kids for 8 years living out here, this is how they turned out. <br/>
The kids they encountered along the way have not done so well. One is not married and has a 2 year old already, another moved out as soon as she turned 18, and is living in a terrible area, but has the freedom she was seeking all along. I could go on and on but I won&#39;t. All this has done is proved to me that in the end I did do something right.<br/>
 <br/>
So yes, some homeschool parents can cause mental anguish to their kids, but any parent can do that, homeschooler or not.<br/>
This area I am in is notorious for over controlling cookie cutter families. And I have seen the same thing you talked about. A kid who is so perfect in front of his Mom until she isn&#39;t around. Then he turns into a terror.<br/>
I have dealt with so many different types of people in my lifetime, but the ones out here have been very hard to be around. I have felt alienated ever since we moved here. <br/>

~~It doesn&#39;t matter where you live or if kids are homeschooled,<br/>
unschooled, public, private, whatever. The method of teaching has<br/>
nothing to do with how a kid turns out mentally.~~<br/>
<br/>
While I agree that tragedy can strike anyone, I don&#39;t believe that<br/>
method of schooling has no effect on mental health. If that were true,<br/>
then unschooling wouldn&#39;t be my best option. But it is. <br/>

mentally.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Some of it can be genetic. Some chemical.<br/>
<br/>
I think most of it has to do with control and coercion.<br/>
<br/>
Teaching method would have a LOT to do with that!<br/>
