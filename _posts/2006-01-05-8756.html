<div id="ygrps-yiv-393324084">&quot;Could one of you adopt us for a while, so I can learn a different way of<br/>
being? : )&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve just been adopted by an entire list of radical unschoolers!!!<br/>
<br/>
I wish I could give you a hug and then invite you down to my art area,<br/>
where stamps are always a mess and paint gets spilled and paper is<br/>
everywhere and just turn your kids loose while we drink a cuppa hot<br/>
chai. I&#39;m envisioning all the good energy surrounding such a moment,<br/>
and  sending it your way.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s time to look into the past....try to evaluate what and<br/>
where these control issues stem from.  I certainly have my share of<br/>
demons to silence and control issues are one of them.<br/>
I don&#39;t know if you have a spiritual or religous path, but the most<br/>
growth happened in my life as I let go of religion and embraced my own<br/>
spirituality (like sweet Jaidens sandwich analogy).  Zen has helped me<br/>
a ton....it&#39;s all about letting go of preconceived notions, letting go<br/>
of preference and being in the moment.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s always helped me to picture some of the people at this list (and<br/>
other lists) sitting right next to me, when these moments unfold and I<br/>
 know there is potential to handle it poorly.  I also think about the<br/>
talks I do, and the advice I give, and how would these people feel if<br/>
they saw me reacting badly to my children. It matters to me that I am<br/>
presenting an honest picture of my life, and it matters that my<br/>
children have the best parts of me....so picturing being &quot;watched&quot; can<br/>
help in a rough moment.<br/>
<br/>
Could you put out some materials, in a place that is safe for<br/>
exploration and just walk away when you feel the need to control?<br/>
Letting them be, with cool stuff, is better than squelching their joy.<br/>
<br/>
And remember, the mind can accept logic quickly, but the<br/>
emotions...the oh-so-tangled web of our pasts can take longer to catch<br/>
up with the mind. Frustrating, but true.<br/>
<br/>
Think about the ways you felt out of control as a child, the things<br/>
that made you feel a need to be in charge. What happened in life that<br/>
made you convinced you had to be in charge or everything would fall apart?<br/>
I can just about bet there&#39;s a little girl inside that ugly control,<br/>
that is scared and just trying to hold her world together.<br/>
That&#39;s what I found out about myself...it was a relief and a shock<br/>
when that realization hit me. I NEEDED to be in control or my world<br/>
was going to go down the drain. I was afraid at the innermost core of<br/>
my being....I&#39;ve learned to roll with the punches a lot better these days.<br/>
<br/>
Try to imagine the very worst possible outcome if you let go of<br/>
control, then ask yourself if the very worst outcome happens, is it<br/>
really that bad? If they get all the stamps ruined, if there are<br/>
stains, if you have mixed ink and mess everywhere but they had fun,<br/>
was it worth the money? <br/>
YES, of course it is.:)<br/>
<br/>
If you never wash the stamps and they stay dirty, it&#39;s OK. Really.<br/>

Oh, and join my imaginationtribe list, to focus on how to live more<br/>
creatively and have fun with art and writing and whatever ways you<br/>
want to express yourself!!  Giving yourself permission to make mess<br/>
and dabble and have fun is a great way to re-gain that childlike sense<br/>
of wonder.   <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/imaginationtribe/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/imaginationtribe/</a><br/>
