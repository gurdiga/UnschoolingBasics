<div id="ygrps-yiv-1480488544">Morning, ALL-<br/>
<br/>
  Hope everyone is having a wonderful Saturday morning. We had lots of <br/>
rain last night which we desperately needed. The conference diva is <br/>
thrilled:))<br/>
<br/>
  Hotel update for everyone: you may want to start making some <br/>
reservations soon for Albuquerque if you haven&#39;t already done so. We <br/>
are doing very well on our pickup for this year and are on the verge of <br/>
selling 75% of all of our available rooms at the hotel. We are doing so <br/>
sooner than in past conferences. To give some numbers, we only have 60 <br/>
of the 169 rooms reserved for Thurs, Fri, and Saturday (7-9 Sept) still <br/>
available.  On Wed (6 Sep) and Sun (10 Sep), we only have 26 rooms <br/>
left. Historically, we don&#39;t sell as many rooms the night before and <br/>
the night after the conference, but this year&#39;s pick up has been good <br/>
since we&#39;re hosting the Ice Cream Social on Wednesday evening and have <br/>
the BYO picnic on Sunday afternoon. Having said that, we went with <br/>
history and reserved only 136 rooms for Wednesday and 111 rooms for <br/>
Sunday -- which is less than the main conference nights (Thurs-Sun). We <br/>
believed we&#39;d be ok when we signed our original contract. For other <br/>
rooms before the 6th and after the 10th, we still have good numbers of <br/>
rooms available. So far, the conference rate extends from 1-14 Sep with <br/>
folks staying this far ahead and after the conference dates.<br/>
<br/>
  Kelly and I were in Massachusetts last weekend for the NE Unschooling <br/>
Conference, and many people who&#39;d not planned to make the trek to New <br/>
Mexico are strongly considering it; some have already registered. I <br/>
hope this e-mail encourages others to do the same soon. Conference <br/>
history has shown some people wait until the last month to make a <br/>
reservation for the hotel. I&#39;m encouraging folks to register sooner <br/>
than later. You can always cancel your hotel reservations if you need.<br/>
