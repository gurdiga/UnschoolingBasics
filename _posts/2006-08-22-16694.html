<div id="ygrps-yiv-1198810738">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve posted here before so I hope my story is a bit familiar. It&#39;s a <br/>
lengthy one but I&#39;ll try to make it brief.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest son, Christian/11, attended school through to the 4th <br/>
grade. He has been tested, diagnosed, medicated, tutored, in <br/>
therapy, in &#39;pull out&#39;.. etc etc etc.<br/>
<br/>
 Let me talk about right now. We decided to homeschool him when he <br/>
was late to school EVERY day because he didn&#39;t want to go. He was <br/>
seriously depressed and suicidal. It was mostly because of the other <br/>
kids and not feeling like he fit in. He didn&#39;t necessarily mind the <br/>
teacher (liked her, actually) or the classroom learning style. We&#39;re <br/>
going on our second year at home. We&#39;ve been deschooling and have <br/>
decided to unschool the kids after some soul searching.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re not radical unschoolers completely, but that&#39;s just for a <br/>
frame of reference. I&#39;m all over the place here, so forgive me, but <br/>
my thoughts are racing and I&#39;m trying to get enough info out to get <br/>
some suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
I believe in not &quot;making&quot; a child do things. Christian will often be <br/>
up late(1 am and beyond) and sleep until noon. I try to get him up <br/>
by noonish (if there&#39;s no where we have plans to be). Yesterday, I <br/>
couldn&#39;t get him to rouse so I let him sleep. At 3:30 a friend <br/>
called and invited us over to shoot off rockets. I woke Christian <br/>
and told him and asked him if he wanted to go. Firstly, he was upset <br/>
that it was 3:30 and that he&#39;d missed so much of the day. Secondly, <br/>
he didn&#39;t know if he wanted to go. I, in my heart, felt that he was <br/>
rather depressed and was reluctant to go because of that. I know him <br/>
enough to know that he&#39;d typically really enjoy this activity. I <br/>
urged him to shower and said that that would probably make him feel <br/>
better and then he could decide. He did that, he hemmed and hawed <br/>
and stressed over his decision. I told him we would all go and if he <br/>
wanted to leave, we&#39;d leave. So we went. He had a fabulous time, as <br/>
we all did, and we came home. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll leave out the rest because I want to try to get to my point. <br/>
When he was stressing over whether he should go or not, we touched <br/>
on the idea that maybe he needs things to do, scheduled things, that <br/>
he enjoys to help him through the week. My two boys are signed up to <br/>
start Karate in Sept. They both are excited to start this. Christian <br/>
is a little fretful because he saw his blackbelt bound friend and <br/>
thought it looked too hard. I did let him know that you don&#39;t START <br/>
out that way, you work up to it. We also have a group we belong to <br/>
that has some structured activities. I know.. not unschooly of me.. <br/>
but the kids really enjoy it.<br/>
<br/>
This is my question. Christian, if he keeps along the same way he&#39;s <br/>
always been, will want to sign up for these things and then give me <br/>
a LOT of trouble about going the day of the event. He has a very <br/>
difficult time with transitions, typically. Lots of times he&#39;ll <br/>
fight me about going, he&#39;ll balk and complain the whole way and then <br/>
dig his heels in about joining in. Then, once he joins in and the <br/>
event is over, he&#39;ll thank me, he&#39;ll apologize for having been <br/>
difficult and he&#39;ll be in a super mood.<br/>
<br/>
What do I do with this? I&#39;ll admit, I used to &#39;make&#39; him do whatever <br/>
it was .. most of the time. He clearly needs activities to help him <br/>
feel upbeat, have something to look forward to, etc. He felt awful <br/>
today when I came back home and found him sleeping and it was 3pm. I <br/>
had tried to wake him before I left and so did my husband, to no <br/>
avail. He even went so far to say he hated himself.<br/>
<br/>
So what I&#39;m asking is what do I do when he balks about doing <br/>
something when I know he enjoys it and will enjoy it after?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>
Just one more fyi, he is on Zoloft for depression and anxiety.<br/>
<br/>
Warm regards,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This really struck me.  I&#39;m not sure why.  Your son needs *you* to<br/>
help him feel upbeat.  Not things and activities are just active<br/>
things.  No different really than a book, game, toy, or other object.<br/>
Just something to think about.<br/>
<br/>
OK, now some other thoughts.  Your son was upset that he slept so late<br/>
and &quot;missed&quot; much of the day.  Three things keep running through my<br/>
head.  1.  Does he have an alarm clock of his own that he can control<br/>
when he wakes up?  Can he determine when he would like to get up using<br/>
an alarm clock.  I believe I bought an inexpensive radio alarm clock<br/>
for less than $10 a few years back.  2.  What does he feel he is<br/>
&quot;missing&quot; by sleeping so late?  Is it a show on tv that could be<br/>
recorded?  Is it the notion that daytime is active time?  Can you help<br/>
him see that whenever he is awake things are going to happen?  3.<br/>
Does his medication play a part in how he sleeps?  Does it cause him<br/>
to sleep longer than normal or more deeply?  Does it cause him to stay<br/>
up later than he would like (or his he just a night owl)?  could the<br/>
time he takes it be changed so that he would naturally fall asleep<br/>
before midnight?<br/>
<br/>
I have a child who used to be reluctant to join in things and then<br/>
afterwards was glad that she did.  This has gone away since we started<br/>
learning to trust each other.  She has gone from &quot;No; I don&#39;t want to<br/>
do that even though it sounds like fun or is something I asked to do&quot;<br/>
to &quot;Sure; I&#39;ll give it a try because I know if I truly don&#39;t enjoy it<br/>
I know I don&#39;t have to finish or come back.&quot;  Does your son have that<br/>
option?  Does he have the option or not completing something or not<br/>
returning to something?  Does he know he has this option?  Have you<br/>
gone to activities where you and he could do things together?  What<br/>
does *he* want to do?  What are his interests?  Doing things just to<br/>
do them is like collecting trading cards just to have them.  If you<br/>
have no joy in the cards, no interest in them, no delight in finding<br/>
that rare foil card, just collect them &quot;&#39;cause&quot; then what&#39;s the point?<br/>
 Do you have a playgroup or homeschool group that you can hang out<br/>
with on a regular basis (preferably one that has unschoolers<br/>
attending)?<br/>
<br/>
I know I am asking a lot of questions and they are mainly rhetorical.<br/>
They are for you to ponder and think about.  I believe that one of the<br/>
biggest things when it comes to unschooling is trust.  If your<br/>
children don&#39;t trust you they aren&#39;t going to trust themselves.  Be<br/>
engaged in his world for a while.  Stay up with him to 1 am and find<br/>
out what is so interesting for him at that time.  Strew his interests<br/>
to help him expand his world.<br/>

I&#39;m not sure I agree, Michelle. Maybe you&#39;d have to know my son to <br/>
know what I mean. I&#39;m sure *I* could be more helpful to him but I <br/>
don&#39;t think there&#39;s much I can do to make him feel upbeat when I&#39;ve <br/>
tried everything I know and he&#39;s still down. One thing that helps is <br/>
exactly what I said and to get him out and in an activity. Whether <br/>
that&#39;s going somewhere, shopping for something or having a friend <br/>
over. It used to be a shower/bath could change his mindset but not <br/>
so much anymore :-( When he&#39;s truly down and in a mood like that, I <br/>
try and try and so does my husband and we can&#39;t pull him out of it <br/>
sometimes. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; They are for you to ponder and think about. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>~~~ I appreciate it and I&#39;ve been thinking about all those questions.<br/>
<br/>
I did call his therapist again and I&#39;m going to talk to him in a <br/>
week. I think it&#39;s a combination of &#39;too much&#39; relaxing and perhaps, <br/>
a new stage of deschooling. Many old behaviors have reared their <br/>
ugly head around here and it&#39;s making me, in turn, fall back on old <br/>
parenting behaviors(but I keep reading here and trying!!).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to be more mindful and try to consider each of my children <br/>
and their needs. It sure is a juggling act, as many of you know!<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate the feedback and the food for thought.<br/>
<br/>
