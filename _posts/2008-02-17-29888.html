<div id="ygrps-yiv-1698373003">Hi, Folks!<br/>
<br/>
First, please accept my apologies for this <br/>
cross-posting.  Many folks receiving this are <br/>
liable to get several copies of this (as I will), <br/>
but I wanted to ensure that I was thorough.<br/>
<br/>
Many people reading this probably know Lisa <br/>
Heyman; she and her family attended Live & Learn <br/>
last year and several years, in fact.  She along <br/>
with her husband, Larry, has been a speaker at at <br/>
least a couple of L&L conferences and has been <br/>
involved in the NE Unschoolers&#39; conference.  She <br/>
has been sharing her incredible wisdom on <br/>
national forums for years, and if you&#39;re lucky <br/>
enough to live in her neck of the woods, as I do, <br/>
you also know that she is also a proactive <br/>
organizer who, in creating a rich world for her <br/>
daughters, Roxanne and &quot;Fire,&quot; makes the world a <br/>
richer, more interesting, more fun place for everyone else, too.<br/>
<br/>
If you know Lisa, you may know that she has been <br/>
having some health challenges for quite a while, <br/>
now, that have been manifesting as <br/>
heart-related.  However, a definitive diagnosis <br/>
had been frustratingly eluding her.  But, last <br/>
week, after testing that included a biopsy of the <br/>
heart itself, she finally got the diagnosis, and <br/>
it&#39;s a tricky one.  She has been diagnosed with <br/>
amyloidosis (I&#39;m guessing primary amyloidosis, <br/>
but that&#39;s just a guess on my part), more <br/>
information about which can be found here:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Lisa asked me to let you know about this, and she <br/>
is asking for the community&#39;s support in the following ways:<br/>
<br/>
If you know Lisa well enough to call her, *please <br/>
don&#39;t*.  Her daughter, Roxanne, asks that folks <br/>
not call the house as she doesn&#39;t want to endure <br/>
the pain right now of having to answer questions <br/>
and retell stories.  Roxy says would appreciate <br/>
adults not asking her about what&#39;s going on; <br/>
however, her friends have shown interest in how <br/>
Roxy herself is doing, and that feels good to her.<br/>
<br/>
Lisa has gone no-mail on the lists she belongs <br/>
to, so if you want to send her an email message, <br/>
you can send it to her home email address, if you <br/>
know it, or send your message to me, and I&#39;ll <br/>
forward it to her (putting &quot;forward to Lisa&quot; in <br/>
the subject line will be extremely helpful!).<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, she asked me (directly quoting Lisa <br/>
here) to &quot;put a request out to the unschooling <br/>
community (e-lists at large) asking for healing <br/>
circle of energy to be sent our way.  I havent <br/>
been terribly active on the lists over the past <br/>
year but do continue to read....We have booked <br/>
our rooms at the NEUnschoolers conference and the <br/>
Live and Learn Conference and look forward to <br/>
seeing everyone there  but in the meantime I am <br/>
calling upon all to send us a welcome energy of <br/>
light, healing and well being to be sent our <br/>
way.  I have called upon my community of friends <br/>
and the love we feel from everyone is a great comfort.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She will benefit, I believe, from all the <br/>
concentrated loving energy that can be focused on <br/>
her, and I am asking folks to hold her in that kind of light.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, everyone!<br/>
<br/>
Sending love,<br/>
Marji<br/>
