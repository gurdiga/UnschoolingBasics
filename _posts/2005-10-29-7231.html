<div id="ygrps-yiv-637484776">Hi folks!<br/>
 <br/>
At the recent Live and Learn Unschooling Conference in St. Louis, Kelly  <br/>
Lovejoy ran a Funshop about conference planning. The conference has become so  big <br/>
she recognized that there was a need for additional local conferences.   <br/>
Sooo.......<br/>
 <br/>
I wanted to give people early notice about the  Northeast Unschooling <br/>
Conference to be held in the spring (Memorial Day  Weekend) in Peabody, <br/>
Massachusetts. There&#39;s a VERY preliminary website up, but  there will be updates soon. <br/>
 <br/>
The website is _www.NortheastUnschoolingConference.com_ <br/>
(http://www.NortheastUnschoolingConference.com) . <br/>
 <br/>
Check us out, and we&#39;ll have more details soon.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1278990997">Hi folks!<br/>
Finally, the first update of the Northeast Unschooling conference web site  <br/>
is complete!  We&#39;re ready to take registrations, and the hotel is ready for  <br/>
your reservations. The conference will be held Memorial Day weekend, May 26-28  <br/>
at the Marriott Hotel in Peabody, Massachusetts, north of Boston.There will be <br/>
 additional optional activities to be announced for Monday, so consider <br/>
whether  you&#39;d like to reserve an extra night at the hotel and stay and make a <br/>
great  Unschooling Long Weekend. <br/>
 <br/>
I am taking proposals for Funshops and Presenters for a few more spaces,  and <br/>
I am now also taking Scholarship applications. (By the way, two people  wrote <br/>
with proposals for some presentations, and the e-mails got lost. If you  have <br/>
not heard from me, PLEASE write again!!!)<br/>
 <br/>
Visit _www.northeastunschoolingconference.com_ <br/>
(http://www.northeastunschoolingconference.com)  for  more information.<br/>
 <br/>

Come to the  Northeast Unschooling Conference, Memorial Day Weekend, May <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1043414968">WOW!  <br/>
What an awesome experience.  This was our first and definitely not<br/>
last conference ever, though we&#39;ve been unschooling our dd her whole<br/>
life.  <br/>
<br/>
Our reasons for going:<br/>
1) My 12yo dd was contemplating going to school for the first time in<br/>
her life. <br/>
2) I had a really hard time explaining RUS to my dh.<br/>
3) 15 yo stepson, who lives with his mother and is in school, just<br/>
happened to get suspended a few days before the conference so we<br/>
brought him with us to explore the option of unschooling. (We believe<br/>
it wasn&#39;t just coincidence. He was meant to be there)   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Things we came home with:<br/>
1) dd is still comtemplating school, but has a new found sense of<br/>
pride in being an unschooler.  She understands that it means not being<br/>
judged (at least by other unschoolers).  She has a real sense of<br/>
belonging with a group of kids that she really thinks are &quot;cool&quot;. (I<br/>
think they are too!)  One quote I liked of hers was &quot;Unschooled kids<br/>
are all different, but schooled kids are the same&quot;.  She realized it<br/>
was a generalization, but I feel it was an accurate take on school and<br/>
conformity. It was a lightbulb for her.<br/>
<br/>
2) Thanks to Ren :) dd&#39;s favorite phrase all this week has been &quot;Yeah,<br/>
Mom,why not?&quot;   We haven&#39;t found a reason &quot;Why not&quot; for anything yet!<br/>
<br/>
3)DH completely agrees with unschooling.  He had so many &quot;wow&quot;<br/>
moments.  His main concern right now is his son, as he&#39;s at a critical<br/>
time in his life.  DH was so impressed and genuinely touched by the<br/>
advice and real concern he received from the other guys, especially. <br/>
He said after we left &quot;I miss them already&quot;<br/>
<br/>
4) Stepson realized that he now has a choice, providing he&#39;s allowed<br/>
to go to school after his hearing, which in itself is enormous<br/>
empowerment.  He also realized that school shouldn&#39;t define him and<br/>
all that goes with that knowledge.  He attended some of the talks with<br/>
his dad and liked Ben&#39;s &quot;Dad&quot; talk especially.   <br/>
   <br/>
5) I learned that solar flares are one of the causes of the northern<br/>
lights, which are like nothing I&#39;ve ever seen (but will someday) in<br/>
Alaska. This only stuck with me because my stepson was doing a report<br/>
on solar flares as part of the school work he was missing while<br/>
suspended. True to Ren&#39;s &quot;Chocolate&quot; talk. Connections.<br/>
<br/>
6)We all made connections with interesting, positive, passionate<br/>
people and are really hoping to go to NM.<br/>
<br/>
It was so worth the money spent.  Thanks you to the organizers. Thank<br/>
you to the speakers.  Thank you to everyone we had the true pleasure<br/>
of meeting.  It was a life changing experience for all of us and I<br/>
mean that with all sincerity.<br/>
<br/>

Is he on Ben&#39;s dads&#39; list? They still keep in contact. They&#39;re nowhere <br/>

  &quot;The hardest problem for the brain is not learning, but forgetting. No <br/>
matter how hard we try, we can&#39;t deliberately forget something we have <br/>
learned, and that is catastrophic if we learn that we can&#39;t learn.&quot;  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1310722466">Please check out the new web site for the Northeast Unschooling Conference.  <br/>
It was designed by unschooling mom and conference alum Crystal Pina.   There&#39;s <br/>
lots new info about presenters, scholarships, and an easy new form to  <br/>
register. Also new this year is the ability to make reservations for the hotel  <br/>
online!<br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;re going to introduce a new event for Friday night, a Cocoa House with  <br/>
performances with an unschooling theme with goodies available.<br/>
 <br/>
Because it took so long to get the new site running, we&#39;re extending the  <br/>
deadline for Early Bird registration to <br/>
January 18, 2008. That will also be the deadline to apply for  scholarships.<br/>

I just had a very generous offer that I&#39;d like to share with you.<br/>
 <br/>
I have available resources for some extra scholarships for the Northeast  <br/>
Unschooling Conference in Peabody, Massachusetts (near Boston) Memorial Day  <br/>
weekend, May 23-25 2008. These scholarships are for families either new to  <br/>
unschooling or who have never had the opportunity to attend a conference. With  the <br/>
scholarships, there would be the expectation that you would stay at the  <br/>
conference hotel, as well as put in some volunteer time, to be worked out with  me. <br/>
It&#39;s past the deadline for scholarships, but we want to make the conference  <br/>
accessible to people who may have recently heard about it or were unable to  <br/>
apply before.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1757235982">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
We are new to unschooling and homeschooling. I just took my 9 year old son out of school one week ago to unschool. We have never been to a conference and would love to attend one to learn more about unschooling and to meet other families who unschool.<br/>
<br/>
We would love to be considered for a scholarship to attend. I stay at home with my two children and my husband works but his industry has been slow lately so we don&#39;t have any extra money right now.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
We&#39;d really like to attend. We are new to unschooling and haven&#39;t been to a conference. I will have to wait until next week to tell you if we could go. My husband is waiting to hear from some prospective employers. He is working now but not making enough-his job is super slow and he works on commission. We appreciate being able to take advantage of any scholarship opportunities.<br/>

Thanks again,<br/>

Along with all the thought provoking sessions we have lined up for you, <br/>
_<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.northeastunschoolingconference.com/Presentations.html_">http://www.northeastunschoolingconference.com/Presentations.html_</a> <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.northeastunschoolingconference.com/Presentations.html)">http://www.northeastunschoolingconference.com/Presentations.html)</a> ,  there are lots of <br/>
activities planned for fun and relaxation.  <br/>
 <br/>
Funshops<br/>
Funshops are open to all ages, although younger children may  need help from <br/>
a parent or older friend for some of them. Funshops will include  things like <br/>
arts and crafts, letterboxing, music, cheerleading, dance, science  play, and <br/>
many, many more. <br/>
<br/>
Karaoke and Dance<br/>
Thursday night will  offer a chance to sing and dance with your friends and <br/>
families. Be brave!  You&#39;ll have a blast!<br/>
<br/>
Talent Show<br/>
The Saturday night conference talent  show allows people of all ages to <br/>
gather and celebrate each other. You will  enjoy a variety of acts ranging from a <br/>
joke-telling 3 year old to experienced  professional performers. It&#39;s a <br/>
welcoming environment that encourages us to take  risks and rejoice in all our <br/>
talents. <br/>

The  Untrepreneurial Fair will be available to all unschoolers (adults and <br/>

they make  to conference attendees. There will be no charge or commission for <br/>
unschoolers  to sell their homemade items. (No food products, please!) <br/>
<br/>
Special  Spaces<br/>
We are lucky to have an abundance of space at this conference site, so  in <br/>
addition to spaces for presentations, discussions, and funshops, we&#39;ll also  <br/>
have a Playroom with things especially meant for our younger ones to enjoy, a  <br/>
Game Room where people will be able to set up their computer and video games, as <br/>
 well as tables for card, role-playing, and other kinds of games, and a  <br/>
Creativity Room, stuffed with the tools for arts and crafts and inventing<br/>
 <br/>
We look forward to seeing you at the conference.  Save some money by  <br/>
registering before May 1, 2009, and join us for this inspirational  conference.<br/>

 <br/>
Don&#39;t miss out on the fun!!  Plan that fun summer vacation and center  it <br/>
around the Northeast Unschooling Conference, in Wakefield Mass, August 27-30, <br/>
 2009!!<br/>
 <br/>
Yes you heard it here, you won&#39;t want to miss out on this wonderful  <br/>
opportunity to jump into unschooling with all the wonderful speaker and  sessions. <br/>
 Among the inspiring session available are: <br/>
 <br/>
Dealing with Reluctance <br/>
An open  discussion with reluctant dads or other family members who may <br/>
have questions  about unschooling versus classroom learning. He invites <br/>
unschooled teens and  their families to join him in discussing the issues raised, <br/>
and the  opportunities and possibilities a free education can provide. With <br/>
Drew  Dorsey.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling in a  Rotten Economy<br/>
You&#39;re a family who may only have one working adult and  maybe the trust <br/>
fund has suffered with the Wall Street Adventures. Your teenager  wants to <br/>
trek through Europe, your preteen wants a dirt bike, and your eight  year old <br/>
wants lots of Webkinz. What do you do? How do you help everyone fulfill  <br/>
their dreams and still have something other than Ramen noodles for supper?  <br/>
Hosted by Beth Toolan.<br/>
<br/>
When Life Intervenes<br/>
We all want to  experience idyllic, joy-filled unschooling, but sometimes <br/>
something harsher  intervenes. How do you survive as an unschooling family <br/>
when illness,  disability, divorce, death or other crisis occurs? Hosted by <br/>
Beth  Toolan<br/>
 <br/>
So register now, plan to circle yourselves with  unschooling families, and <br/>
immerse yourself in trust and respect.  <br/>
