<div id="ygrps-yiv-67278652">Hi,<br/>
I have a question about an unschooling anxiety I have & I would love some input from you - either personal ideas or thoughts etc, or links to articles/book recs etc.<br/>
The one issue I find difficult to resolve in my mind is a question of family dynamic, and school being a new reality and space away from home. When I was a child, my family was disturbed, and school was although less than ideal (ha!) it was a place where I could escape my family and have space to redefine myself away from the powerful influences of my parents and brother.<br/>
Of course my family now is emotionally about a million miles away from my family of origin, but I still have a lingering doubt about providing this time and space away from powerful parental influences. Plus, I&#39;m not perfect (!) and aware I have foibles and ups and downs. I worry about immersing my children in too closed a world, emotionally. Some days I have issues to deal with, and am pre-occupied at times. Other days I am sure I act in response to what&#39;s going on internally. I believe my husband & I are pretty healthy emotionally but still this nagging doubt about room to escape the family.<br/>
Do you think that it is a moot point and that a truly healthy relationship makes this a non-issue?<br/>
Also, since my children are so young, am I just not quite tuned into the fact that they will have plenty of self elected external opportunities, should they desire?<br/>
Do you consider the school dynamic so emotionally broken and disruptive, that a healthy, loving child-led home side-steps this whole thought...?<br/>
Finally, is it simply a question of confidence and shaking off an entrenched idea of the superiority of school?<br/>
Thank you!<br/>

That&#39;s part of it. Its normal to see what&#39;s going on now as The Way Things Are, when living with children is all about things changing. Little kids have very different needs than tweens or teens. <br/>

Do your kids seem to want time away from you? You could look for ways to offer that -playdates with friends where you go do something else, or little classes... sunday school or dance class or whatever. If they want you close, then you can know they don&#39;t need time away from you. <br/>
<br/>
A good response to personal doubts is a little experimentation. You can&#39;t always know what your kids need - but you can offer and see what happens. That&#39;s an especially good strategy with kids who aren&#39;t terribly verbal. <br/>
<br/>
You are not your parents. That&#39;s something to remind yourself maybe ;) That matters. Your kids have something you didn&#39;t have - they have you. If you&#39;re engaged with and responsive to your children, then its likely they won&#39;t need a way to escape from you. <br/>

There&#39;s some of that, too. There are tons of cultural messages that kids &quot;need&quot; time away from parents. Young children often need a whooooole lot more time with parents than is culturally normal these days. And as kids get older, if you&#39;re engaged and responsive, you&#39;ll see when they need time to themselves and you&#39;ll be actively helping them get their space, or helping them find other things to do. <br/>
<br/>
I have a 17yo who spends time with friends, works, travels... I tell people he&#39;s more like a 21yo in a lot of ways. Home is where he touches base, his safety zone or backup plan, but not somewhere he Needs to be all the time. That&#39;s not going to be true of every teenager, but for comparison, four years ago this same kid rarely left the house, kept &quot;vampire hours&quot; and played Runescape most of his waking hours. Things do change with time ;)<br/>
