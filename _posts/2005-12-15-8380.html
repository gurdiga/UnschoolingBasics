<div id="ygrps-yiv-1125276681">I&#39;ve had something come up at our home, and I was hoping y&#39;all could give me some insight.<br/>
<br/>
My question/concern is about sleep (or the lack there of).  Before I pulled Tristan from school, he had problems sleeping every night.  Once in bed (and we had to have a set bedtime to make sure he had adequate sleep for the next school day) he would claim that &quot;I know I won&#39;t be able to sleep&quot; &quot;I&#39;ll just feel awful in the morning&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m trying to sleep &#39;cause it just won&#39;t work!&quot;  I would be understanding, since I have dealt with my own sleep problems for a number of years.  We&#39;d talk in his darkened room, play quiet music that he liked, try to get him to relax and not focus on whether he could/could not sleep, etc.  He was so stressed out about school, that he would run the day&#39;s events in his head over and over again and was unable to fall asleep.  Or so I thought.<br/>
<br/>
Now that we are unschooling (well, deschooling right now), I thought that his sleep problem would disappear.  Not so.  I decided to lift the bedtime restriction, and he has been going to bed late - between 1:30 and 3:00AM and then sleeping until about 11AM.  I&#39;m a nightowl, but even this is pushing it for me so I&#39;ll head to bed and allow him to stay up as long as it is quiet (he can watch a movie downstairs, read, play quietly, etc.).<br/>
<br/>
Last night Tristan asked to get on the computer, and I allowed that.  I found him still awake at 4AM this morning and going strong. I had him shut down the computer and go to bed  (probably a mistake).  I think the computer was a little TOO engaging.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just wondering....is this most likely just a phase?  A newfound freedom that he is exploring?  I can see it easily developing into a habit, however.  If someone doesn&#39;t wake up until one in the afternoon, they most likely will not be tired when midnight rolls around. <br/>
<br/>
Although I want to lift any bedtime restrictions, I&#39;m unsure about him sleeping all day (well, into the afternoon) and then staying up the majority of the night.  My concern is that we do, at times, have commitments in the mornings.  He&#39;s 9 and not yet at an age where I can leave him home alone.  I was also hoping to get him involved with a local homeschooling group, but some of their activities are in the morning...not conducive to a child who is getting to bed in the wee hours of the morning.   <br/>
<br/>
Right now it&#39;s noon, and I haven&#39;t heard a peep for Tristan.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1956612349">I&#39;m not sure how much help this will be but I have a 14 yr old who doesnt go <br/>
to sleep until 1am -3 am.  I used to get him up in the morning ( before <br/>
unschooling came into our lives) & he was a grouch ALL day.  Even though I <br/>
got him up, he would still stay up till around 2 or 3 am.  He just can&#39;t go <br/>
to sleep at an &quot;early&quot; hour.<br/>
<br/>
Now that we let go of the control,  he has the choice of going to sleep <br/>
early, staying up late, sleeping late, or getting up early....... our house <br/>
is a much happier house !!  When there is something he wants to do (like <br/>
hunting with dad) he&#39;ll try & get to sleep by midnight so he can get up at <br/>
5am.  So when he wants or needs to he chooses to get up.  There are days we <br/>
go shopping & if he wants to go spend money he has to get up when we do but <br/>
its his choice.  If he chooses not to get up, we go ahead & go without him. <br/>
But that doesnt happen very often he likes spending money too much :)<br/>
<br/>
Mine was asleep till noon today also.  Its also winter & we all tend to <br/>
sleep longer in the morning during these dark months. I&#39;ll be interested to <br/>
see if mine has the same sleep pattern come spring.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1646701425">This is REALLY common. i know MANY teenagers who stay up most of the  <br/>
night - especially those who play online games. My kids will stay up  <br/>
later and later - and, yes, sometimes I get up in the morning and  <br/>
they&#39;re still up - if they don&#39;t have a reason to get up early. But,  <br/>
these days, they also usually plan ahead and go to bed at least 8  <br/>
hours before they know they need to get up. It has taken some trial  <br/>
and error - sometimes getting too tired and being cranky the next  <br/>
day, etc.  But it is VERY normal for teens to not feel sleepy at  <br/>
nightl, just when younger and older people are starting wind down,  <br/>
they&#39;re revving up.<br/>
<br/>
It can be hard for parents not to see it as a moral failing of some  <br/>
kind. But it isn&#39;t - it is biologically natural.<br/>

I just went through this with my 11 yo dd.  We started deschooling in <br/>
April.  There is light in the end of the tunnel.  <br/>
<br/>
Many times she would stay up till 3 - 4am and not get up before noon.  <br/>
It&#39;s part of deschooling, they want to control their bed time, wake up <br/>
time, what they eat - everything.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say our social life slowed down a bit, but it was worth <br/>
the wait.  She goes to bed when she is tired and gets up when she is <br/>
ready.  Now, she goes to bed between 11 - 12 and gets up around 9 - <br/>
10am.  If we have something that we are doing the next day and she <br/>
really wants to go, she gets to bed early and gets herself up.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also learned not to schedule things before 10 - 11 am.  My dd is <br/>
a night owl and like to sleep in.<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there it will change - he will get intuned to his body and set <br/>
a regular schedule - be patient - it works.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m not a morning person at all, so there is a large part of me that really does like that he sleeps in -- it gives me a chance to sleep in as well. *grin*  I think I hated school days even more than Tristan did when it came to getting up early.  We were both such grumps every morning.<br/>
<br/>
Because of school, I became so used to scheduling things first thing in the morning because that was the most convenient time -- at the time.  I guess times have changed, however!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1954107486">With all this talk about sleeping , I thought I would chime in as well. <br/>
What about when you have more then one age in one family? DO you think <br/>
its wise to let say a 2-3 yo stay up with the 8-9 yo? I know with our <br/>
family that the 3yo is ready for bed alot soonner then the 8yo but <br/>
doesnt want to go to bed becuase the 8yo is still up and she doesnt <br/>
want to miss anything...but she gets more and more cranky...where as if <br/>
I take her up say at 8 and lay with her and read her stories , shes out <br/>
by 8:30..if I keep her up and dont unwind with her she stays up yes, <br/>
but the whole house is a house of TANTRUM...LOL...hey that almost <br/>
sounds like a horror flick.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1280775994">Hi Malinda,<br/>
<br/>
My first question would be &quot;Does Tristan WANT to go to those activities?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My second would be &quot;Are activities the real reason you would like Tristan on a more traditional sleep pattern?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My kids do go to bed somewhere between 9 and 11 at night.  The kids have lots of animals for 4-H projects and they need to be fed and cared for before we can go do whatever we have planned for the day.  It was a decision that we all agreed on prior to getting the animals.<br/>
<br/>
I do have to say though that prior to that, when the kids were all on different sleeping schedules, I missed them.  I felt strung out, not close, like I didn&#39;t see them enough even though we all live in the same house.  The kids haven&#39;t talked about it but I do strongly prefer that we live on somewhat the same schedule just because I like them &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, if they got rid of the animals and wanted to stay up all night, I&#39;m sure that is what we would do.<br/>

&gt; was so stressed out about school, that he would run the day&#39;s <br/>
&gt; events in his head over and over again and was unable to fall <br/>
&gt; asleep.  Or so I thought.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now that we are unschooling (well, deschooling right now), I <br/>
&gt; thought that his sleep problem would disappear.  Not so.  I <br/>
&gt; decided to lift the bedtime restriction, and he has been going to <br/>
&gt; bed late - between 1:30 and 3:00AM and then sleeping until about <br/>
&gt; 11AM.  I&#39;m a nightowl, but even this is pushing it for me so I&#39;ll <br/>
&gt; head to bed and allow him to stay up as long as it is quiet (he <br/>
&gt; can watch a movie downstairs, read, play quietly, etc.).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Last night Tristan asked to get on the computer, and I allowed <br/>
&gt; that.  I found him still awake at 4AM this morning and going <br/>
&gt; strong. I had him shut down the computer and go to bed  (probably <br/>
&gt; a mistake).  I think the computer was a little TOO engaging.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m just wondering....is this most likely just a phase?  A <br/>
&gt; newfound freedom that he is exploring?  I can see it easily <br/>
&gt; developing into a habit, however.  If someone doesn&#39;t wake up <br/>
&gt; until one in the afternoon, they most likely will not be tired <br/>
&gt; when midnight rolls around. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Although I want to lift any bedtime restrictions, I&#39;m unsure about <br/>
&gt; him sleeping all day (well, into the afternoon) and then staying <br/>
&gt; up the majority of the night.  My concern is that we do, at times, <br/>
&gt; have commitments in the mornings.  He&#39;s 9 and not yet at an age <br/>
&gt; where I can leave him home alone.  I was also hoping to get him <br/>
&gt; involved with a local homeschooling group, but some of their <br/>
&gt; activities are in the morning...not conducive to a child who is <br/>
&gt; getting to bed in the wee hours of the morning.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Right now it&#39;s noon, and I haven&#39;t heard a peep for Tristan.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-156131867">I sense a misunderstanding of this idea of &quot;no bedtimes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Helping a 3 year old settle down and get to sleep when she is sleepy  <br/>
IS what we&#39;re talking about when we say, &quot;no bedtimes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You wouldn&#39;t keep her up later just because it isn&#39;t bedtime yet and  <br/>
you wouldn&#39;t send her off to bed earlier just because it is bedtime now.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;d pay attention to her sleepiness and help her recognize that  <br/>
she&#39;s sleepy and help her get to sleep. Not based on the clock, based  <br/>
on the reality of her state of being.<br/>
<br/>
There were times I asked older kids to quiet down, let me lower the  <br/>
lights, put on a very-familiar movie, so that the youngest would be  <br/>
able to relax and not be trying so hard to keep herself up. She&#39;d  <br/>
just fall asleep on the couch - I&#39;d put a blanket over her and she&#39;d  <br/>
sleep there. But usually when I saw her sleepiness signs, I took the  <br/>
younger one into another room and I&#39;d read or sing to her.<br/>
<br/>
My youngest sometimes said, &quot;NO, I know I&#39;ll fall asleep but I don&#39;t  <br/>
want to.&quot; I&#39;d ask her to come and let me read 2 stories or sing 2  <br/>
songs or something.  Once I got her out of the commotion of the rest  <br/>
of the family, she&#39;d usually get settled down and enjoy her time with  <br/>
me. But, yeah, sometimes she&#39;d get back up and sometimes she&#39;d get  <br/>
over-tired and be cranky. Learning experiences.<br/>

Hi Malinda,<br/>
<br/>
My first question would be &quot;Does Tristan WANT to go to those<br/>
activities?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My second would be &quot;Are activities the real reason you would like<br/>
Tristan on a more traditional sleep pattern?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My kids do go to bed somewhere between 9 and 11 at night.  The kids have<br/>
lots of animals for 4-H projects and they need to be fed and cared for<br/>
before we can go do whatever we have planned for the day.  It was a<br/>
decision that we all agreed on prior to getting the animals.</div>

I&#39;m not  a morning person at all, so there is a large part of me that really <br/>
does like  that he sleeps in -- it gives me a chance to sleep in as well. <br/>
*grin*  I  think I hated school days even more than Tristan did when it came to <br/>
getting  up early.  We were both such grumps every  morning.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
LOL... my DH had the nerve to suggest sending our middle child to school  <br/>
because he thought she &quot;needed&quot; it... Now, she&#39;s a very headstrong kiddo, and so  <br/>
I told him there was NO WAY IN HECK that I was going to get up early every  <br/>
morning to fight with her about getting dressed, getting ready, and getting her <br/>
 out the door on time. and dragging the other 2 with me. She&#39;d HAVE to go on <br/>
the  bus, since we only have one vehicle at the moment, and I do NOT want <br/>
that. Well,  he hasn&#39;t brought that up in a long time...<br/>
She gets up early. But, she&#39;s pretty good about not being too loud. She&#39;ll  <br/>
get a juice box, granola bar or cereal and sit down and watch Disney or Nickjr. <br/>
 Or, she&#39;ll come snuggle with me and the puppy. I wish we had a TV in our <br/>
room  again... I used to have all 3 kids and the cats in bed, all snuggling in <br/>
various  stages of rest/sleep until late morning. I loved it.  <br/>

What  about when you have more then one age in one family? DO you think <br/>
its wise  to let say a 2-3 yo stay up with the 8-9 yo? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
Well, in our family, the 4 year old goes to bed anywhere between 7-9. She  <br/>
starts picking fights with her brother when she gets tired. We take her in, get  <br/>
her in bed, sing her Hush Little Baby (my kids HAVE to have this sung...) and <br/>
 tuck her in. She is allowed her books, a few toys and whatnot, and her light <br/>
on.  She&#39;s usually out within 15-30 mins.<br/>
Our oldest (6), likes to play video games, unless I have shows on I like to  <br/>
watch. He always asks. If I do have something I want to watch, he&#39;ll play with <br/>
 his toys. Or watch. He sat on my lap and watched The Apprentice finale the <br/>
other  night, and he gave me a &quot;manicure&quot; lol... On nights he plays video <br/>
games, he  plays until 9 or 10 and then will veg out in the chair and watch Food <br/>
TV. He  loves watching Alton Brown&#39;s Good Eats. Or the competition shows. They <br/>
had a  cool holiday cake one the other night. He will usually say he&#39;s tired <br/>
around 11  and ask to go to bed, which involves one of us tucking him in and <br/>
singing to him  too. Some nights, he&#39;ll go in early and read or play with a few <br/>
toys in  bed.<br/>
The baby (1), she sleeps when she sleeps. Usually she&#39;s down for the night  <br/>
about 10 or 11. Depends on when she napped during the day. It&#39;s almost 5 now <br/>
and  she&#39;s stirring a bit from her nap. So, I&#39;m guessing she&#39;ll sleep around 11  <br/>
tonight. <br/>
We don&#39;t usually go many places in the mornings. We only have one vehicle  <br/>
and DH works, so things are scheduled around him. Sleep is never much of an  <br/>
issue here. DH is a little harder to convince of that. LOL  <br/>

The thing is, my kids didn&#39;t &quot;express a desire&quot; to sleep on various <br/>
schedules- they sleep according to their bodies cues and their <br/>
personal preferences.  Private moments are just a nice side effect (as <br/>
opposed to being the main point) of their naturally differing sleep <br/>
cycles.<br/>

Same here. My kids have never said &quot;I want to stay up later&quot; because <br/>
there is no border or line laid down by me. The only limit in life, is <br/>
my energy.:) And the two young ones like to lay down with me when I&#39;m <br/>
tired, so that&#39;s sometimes a bit before they would...not often though, <br/>
since I&#39;m a major night owl.<br/>
I don&#39;t know how kids would express a desire to change their sleep <br/>

getting up when everyone else does.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1764026373">Hi Julie!<br/>
<br/>
Your questions really got me to thinking.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;My first question would be &quot;Does Tristan WANT to go to those activities?&quot;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Tristan is a very social kid -- loves people (kids and adults alike) and really any sort of activity that will allow him to be around them.  That said, I&#39;m wondering if I&#39;m trying to rush us into things (Tristan&#39;s only been out of school for a few weeks)?  I think a part of me is afraid he&#39;ll want to go back to school, despite all the problems he had, just to be with the kids.  Plus, I can&#39;t but think that maybe I&#39;m buckling under the pressure that my parents are putting on me to make sure Tristan is &quot;properly&quot; socialized since he is now homeschooled.  They seem to think he is going to become some antisocial deviant since he isn&#39;t bombarded by kids at school all day every day -- for better or worse...usually worse, in Tristan&#39;s case.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&quot;Are activities the real reason you would like Tristan on a more traditional sleep pattern?&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think so. IF there were activities that were extremely important to him (like your kids&#39; 4-H projects) I would hope that he would see that his sleep would need to be adjusted in order to keep up with his activities.  I let Tristan determine which activities he would like to pursue, as I would never force him into any activities.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s so much that I would like him on a more traditional sleep pattern, rather than me seeing it as being so out of the norm for him and others his age. Not that we have to follow the crowd when it comes to &quot;proper&quot; bedtimes!  <br/>
<br/>
As much as I love the whole concept and thought behind an unschooling lifestyle, parts of it are hard to apply when you have been raised differently all your life.  My parents were so controlling (and still try to be at times), and it&#39;s hard to break free from certain mindsets.<br/>
<br/>
I think a little bit of worry is also creeping in because my parents will be coming for Christmas.  They are humoring me in regards to homeschooling (basically supporting my decision but want Tristan &quot;mainstreamed&quot; back into school ASAP) but would be totally and utterly against the idea of unschooling.  I can see just an incredibly unhappy visit on the horizon.<br/>

***Tristan is a very social kid -- I think a part of me is afraid he&#39;ll want<br/>

<br/>
My DD is very social, too. And she&#39;s loving being at home.  We still do<br/>
plenty of other things... she actually much more well-rounded now because<br/>
gets involved with things with people of all ages.<br/>
<br/>
***They seem to think he is going to become some antisocial deviant since he<br/>
isn&#39;t bombarded by kids at school all day every day -- for better or worse..<br/>
usually worse, in Tristan&#39;s case.***<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found it to be the opposite... I believe kids have a higher percent of<br/>
being an &quot;antisocial deviant&quot; by being in school and being bombarded with<br/>
all of the junk from the other kids.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
***IF there were activities that were extremely important to him (like your<br/>
kids&#39; 4-H projects) I would hope that he would see that his sleep would need<br/>
to be adjusted in order to keep up with his activities.***<br/>
<br/>
I just dropped my 9yo dd&#39;s bedtime and have just reminded her that when she<br/>
has things to do in the morning that it would be wise for her not to stay up<br/>
too late.  She has to head to her room at about 10 - 10:30 pm.  She can stay<br/>
up as late as she wants but she has to stick to her space.  I really think<br/>
that it helps to wind down from the day and she gets sleepy on her own.<br/>
<br/>
***I think a little bit of worry is also creeping in because my parents will<br/>
be coming for Christmas.  They are humoring me in regards to homeschooling<br/>

<br/>
Yes, I too has unsupportive family members.  I just started unschooling<br/>
recently... it gradually just fell into place.  And I&#39;ve decided to keep it<br/>
to myself.  It&#39;s really none of there &quot;business&quot; anyway.  I&#39;d suggest being<br/>
low-key about it.  You don&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; answer all of there questions and I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t offer up anything on your own.  &quot;Homeschooling is going great!&quot;...<br/>
that&#39;s what I say when I&#39;m asked.  It&#39;s the holiday season anyway... so if<br/>
asked, just mention that your taking a few weeks off to enjoy it... that may<br/>
be a good reason to seem so lax to them.<br/>

<br/>
Which is exactly what we did until the kids wanted to add over 30 livestock animals for 4-H to our already busy lives.  I wasn&#39;t interested in taking on that amount of work on myself so we talked about how we could handle it and make it work for ALL of us.  Initially, I fed in the morning and the kids did the evenings but that was problematic due to sports practices in the evenings.  So we talked about it and we decided that it would work better for the kids to feed in the mornings.<br/>
<br/>
The kids chose to forgo their bodies cues on sleep to do something else they enjoy, no different than signing up for a morning class or going to a concert.  If the kids decided they would rather sleep than raise the animals that is what we would do.<br/>

<br/>
We were initially living quite &quot;freeform&quot; but the kids have wanted to add and add various activities to be able to do the things we all want, we have had to make agreements about how things would look, how they would work....no different than asking an older child to have the tv off for a while so a younger one can get to sleep, negotiating various needs and desires is a main aspect of unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Hi Julie!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Your questions really got me to thinking.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;My first question would be &quot;Does Tristan WANT to go to those <br/>
&gt; activities?&quot;&gt;<br/>
&gt; Tristan is a very social kid -- loves people (kids and adults <br/>
&gt; alike) and really any sort of activity that will allow him to be <br/>
&gt; around them.  That said, I&#39;m wondering if I&#39;m trying to rush us <br/>
&gt; into things (Tristan&#39;s only been out of school for a few weeks)?  <br/>
&gt; I think a part of me is afraid he&#39;ll want to go back to school, <br/>
&gt; despite all the problems he had, just to be with the kids.  Plus, <br/>
&gt; I can&#39;t but think that maybe I&#39;m buckling under the pressure that <br/>
&gt; my parents are putting on me to make sure Tristan is &quot;properly&quot; <br/>
&gt; socialized since he is now homeschooled.  They seem to think he is <br/>
&gt; going to become some antisocial deviant since he isn&#39;t bombarded <br/>
&gt; by kids at school all day every day -- for better or <br/>
&gt; worse...usually worse, in Tristan&#39;s case.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;&quot;Are activities the real reason you would like Tristan on a more <br/>
&gt; traditional sleep pattern?&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t think so. IF there were activities that were extremely <br/>
&gt; important to him (like your kids&#39; 4-H projects) I would hope that <br/>
&gt; he would see that his sleep would need to be adjusted in order to <br/>
&gt; keep up with his activities.  I let Tristan determine which <br/>
&gt; activities he would like to pursue, as I would never force him <br/>
&gt; into any activities.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s so much that I would like him on a more <br/>
&gt; traditional sleep pattern, rather than me seeing it as being so <br/>
&gt; out of the norm for him and others his age. Not that we have to <br/>
&gt; follow the crowd when it comes to &quot;proper&quot; bedtimes!  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As much as I love the whole concept and thought behind an <br/>
&gt; unschooling lifestyle, parts of it are hard to apply when you have <br/>
&gt; been raised differently all your life.  My parents were so <br/>
&gt; controlling (and still try to be at times), and it&#39;s hard to break <br/>
&gt; free from certain mindsets.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think a little bit of worry is also creeping in because my <br/>
&gt; parents will be coming for Christmas.  They are humoring me in <br/>
&gt; regards to homeschooling (basically supporting my decision but <br/>
&gt; want Tristan &quot;mainstreamed&quot; back into school ASAP) but would be <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-849051897">&lt;&lt;Is there a reason the animals can only be fed early in the morning?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Good question.  Actually there are a few reasons.  We raise dairy goats so they must be fed and milked on a schedule, within an hour or so of the same time twice per day, otherwise their milk production drops way off and they can even dry up on you.  For animals to grow fastest (which is what you want for competitions), they really need to be fed about 12 hours apart, hence in the morning and in the evening.<br/>
<br/>
Problem comes in with my older daughter&#39;s competitive gymnastics....she has to be at the gym by 3:00 everyday....coupled with the fact that we live about an hour drive from anything we might want to do.  So even with getting up around 7:30am, we can&#39;t get everything fed (including us) and dressed until around 9:30 or 10.  With a 2 hour drive round trip and having to get back by 3:00, that gives us an entire 3 hours to go to the zoo, a movie, a picnic, whatever.  The three older kids show animals and we agreed ahead of time that we needed to make sure that there was still time each day for the younger kids to do fun things too.<br/>
<br/>
This was all discussed ahead of time when the kids wanted to get the animals and do competitions.  We talked about the realities of time constraints, about it being a day in, day out kind of committment.  And the kids know that all they have to do say &quot;I&#39;m out&quot; and they are no longer committed.  We could literally have the goats sold within a week.  The animals take about 20 hours of work per week.  That is why we had long talks ahead of time because I knew that there was no way I could make that kind of time committment alone.  The kids had to either be in 100% or we couldn&#39;t do it.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are perfectly happy with the arrangement and when there have been times that interest has seemed to lag, we have talked about whether we want to continue doing this or not.  Usually, the lack of interest is very short lived and tied to a particular thing they might need to miss (validation (you don&#39;t get to pick the day and you must be there in order to go to any shows that year) on same weekend as spur of the moment sleep over so it comes down to picking between 2 things you enjoy).<br/>
<br/>
Even so, we try to be as flexible as possible.  Adriane went to a sleepover so I fed for her that morning.  Marsie had a chance to see a friend she hadn&#39;t seen in a while so I made sure the goats had water and the baby chickens were warm (her usual contribution).  They do the same for me if I ask them.  They do the same for each other.  Danny fed Marsie&#39;s rabbit this morning because she went to church with a friend.  <br/>
