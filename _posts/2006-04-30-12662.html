<div id="ygrps-yiv-1751980269">Hi all-  I am glad to have found this loop.  I am a relatively new <br/>
home schooling mama to 3--7 yo dd, 5 yo ds and 3 yo dd.  We started <br/>
last fall.  I am REALLY new to the idea of unschooling.  I used to <br/>
think this was all crazy but I should have known better.  Everytime I <br/>
make some sweeping generalization about something then God laughs at <br/>
me and sends me in that direction.  I am loving the lifestyle we have <br/>
of being with each other so much and allowing the ebb and flow of our <br/>
rhythmns to happen.  I haven&#39;t been all that pleased with how burned <br/>
out I&#39;ve felt from using curriculums not to mention how my daughter <br/>
has responded to almost everything.  My biggest fear however with <br/>
going purely unschooled is that she is not a leader or much of a self <br/>
starter.  I will be honest, I don&#39;t know if it is because she&#39;s never <br/>
had much of an opportunity to be or if it&#39;s just her nature.  But I <br/>
am afraid that she will not do much with herself.  Is that crazy?  <br/>
Has anyone else ever felt that way?  I&#39;m sure you must get this a <br/>
lot.  I apologize for adding to it.  I&#39;ve been running into so much <br/>
information on unschooling lately that I feel like it is no <br/>
coincidence.  I just know one thing--we left school because the whole <br/>
idea of it was wrong for us.  I really want then all to be happy, <br/>
learning children who are enjoying their little lives and adding <br/>
something to the world.  I can&#39;t wait to learn from you all.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Even though I&#39;m not really an unschooler (I&#39;m relaxed eclectic), do <br/>
remember -- she is 7, and will change a LOT over the years.  My son <br/>
is 14, and boy, howdy, has he changed over the years.  That&#39;s one of <br/>
the cool things about kids -- you never know what next year will be <br/>
like based on this year, because, it&#39;s kind of like dog years, they <br/>
change so much.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure it isn&#39;t crazy, any more than me worrying about the myriad <br/>
things I worry about.  (Some of the things I worried about over the <br/>
last 4 years have finally worked themselves out.  Phew!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-669564245">Hi Kristi and welcome!<br/>
<br/>
I have a daughter who is 12 and although we&#39;ve been homeschooling <br/>
(mostly &quot;school-at-home&quot; approach) for 2 years, it has only been <br/>
recently we&#39;ve started with unschooling. I felt alot of the same stuff <br/>
about about my daughter...not a leader, would watch tv for hours on <br/>
end, only child so no one to play with... just lots of stuff. But in <br/>
the almost month we&#39;ve been just living and not worrying <br/>
about &quot;school&quot; I&#39;ve seen her blossom and flourish! I realized that if <br/>
I would just leave her the heck alone and be a resource for her and <br/>
quit trying to &quot;teach&quot; her, she opens my eyes to her own intelligence! <br/>
I read in a book somewhere... either John Holt or Grace Llewellyn...if <br/>
anyone recognizes this let me know so I give proper credit... that <br/>
there is no true teaching, only learning. I love that! It also says <br/>
that a teacher is only there to facilitate learning. You can &quot;teach&quot; <br/>
all you want but if no real learning (not just to pass the test and <br/>
forget but REAL learning)is happening it&#39;s no good. Anyway, just some <br/>
thoughts! Hope you enjoy this group... I sure do!<br/>
