<div id="ygrps-yiv-160803632">&quot;  My best friend told me that<br/>
her little sister didn&#39;t utter a word until she was 3 years old.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That would be my Jalen, now four. He said &quot;na-na&quot; (for nursing) and <br/>
made this &quot;Ttttsssssss&quot; sound while pointing at anything of <br/>
interest.  I bet most of the folks here that attended the 2003 Live <br/>
and Learn conference and met Jalen, will remember his &quot;Ttttsssss&quot; <br/>
sound. <br/>
That was about all he did until close to three years old. Then he <br/>
started saying a few words, within a few months he was into full <br/>
sentences.<br/>
He&#39;s still not as verbal as some four year olds. Big deal. He knows <br/>
how to communicate and that&#39;s what matters.<br/>
<br/>
I am not a big fan of speech therapy. I think it&#39;s a way for people <br/>
to make money, instill fear into parents and the children would <br/>
figure it out on their own anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think there are very many people who actually need <br/>
intervention for their speech...and certainly NOT at two years old.<br/>

I don&#39;t  think there are very many people who actually need <br/>
intervention for their  speech...and certainly NOT at two years old.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I agree completely with this....and I&#39;m a speech pathologist.  My  private <br/>
practice has really suffered these past two years since we have become  <br/>
unschoolers...&gt;g&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Usually I get a call from a parent worried about their child not meeting  the <br/>
&quot;norms&quot; according to some testing they did at a public school or they may  <br/>
have a relative who has commented on their minimal expressive  speech.  With <br/>
younger kids, I usually arrange to meet with the parents  (usually just the mom <br/>
will come) and with really young kids I give the  parent some suggestions of <br/>
natural language modeling that they can do with  their kids.<br/>
 <br/>
 Language and speech modeling is something most parent do without even  <br/>
thinking about it.<br/>
However, for some parents it helps them to have some examples of how to  talk <br/>
to their kids and expand or even parallel their language.  An example  of an <br/>
expansion would be if your child says &quot;mo&quot; and points to his cup.   The parent <br/>
would say, &quot;You want more milk?  I&#39;ll pour you some.&quot; I strongly  discourage <br/>
speech therapy at this point and talk to the parent about<br/>
every child needing their own timetable for walking and talking. As a  <br/>
result, all the children I work with are 10 or older.<br/>
 <br/>
With older kids, I will only work with them if they are the ones wanting to  <br/>
do something about their speech patterns or reading.  Right now, I have a  few <br/>
kids that are 10-13 who are frustrated with not being able to read the  <br/>
things they want to read and a couple who are not happy with their speech  because <br/>
of articulation problems.  It is their choice rather than their  parents to <br/>
come to speech and I help them with the things they want help  with.<br/>
 <br/>
I spend a lot of time talking with the parents of the children and recently  <br/>
lent The Teenage Liberation Handbook to the mom of a 13 year old girl I&#39;m  <br/>
helping with reading. This girl really wants to read teen  magazines.  She has <br/>
fetal alcohol syndrome and truly struggles with  reading.  Her goal is to be <br/>
able to read articles in some of her favorite  magazines and to be able to <br/>
understand them. It is her goal.  Not her mom&#39;s  or mine.  <br/>
 <br/>
Another girl I see has a very rare neurological disorder and was expecting  <br/>
to only be using sign language by now.  She can read very simple sentences  and <br/>
words and every time I see her will tell me how she just wants to  read.  She <br/>
has the most amazingly beautiful heart and soul and is a gifted  ballet <br/>
dancer.  She will be 14 soon but may  not live past  20. She wants so much to read.<br/>
My goal is to help her read because that is what she wants.<br/>
 <br/>
I started out just wanting to say that usually children don&#39;t need speech  <br/>
therapy at 2 or 5 or 7.  Give them all the time they need as they speak and  <br/>
talk and grow and be the beautiful person they are.  Celebrate who they are  <br/>
rather than worrying about another person&#39;s idea of what milestones they should  <br/>
have accomplished. Be a good language and speech model for your child and  <br/>
realize that may mean &quot;you&quot; learning how to do this rather than taking your  child <br/>
a speech therapist to be fixed.  Your child may just need more time  or maybe <br/>
you may need to learn how to provide more language stimulation at  home to <br/>
help them.<br/>
