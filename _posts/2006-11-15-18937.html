<div id="ygrps-yiv-660610739">As a family we often go bowling, play pool, shoot hoops, etc.  My <br/>
oldest daughter is a very intense perfectionist.  She only wants to <br/>
win and when she doesn&#39;t she throws a fit and says she never has any <br/>
fun.  And she also said, &quot;if I don&#39;t win then it&#39;s not fun&quot;.  Even <br/>
if hubby and I play badly and let her win she still brings herself <br/>
down by saying she didn&#39;t get enough points.  Hubby is <br/>
still &#39;experimenting&#39; with unschooling as he is very nervous about <br/>
the &#39;outcome&#39;.  He takes her competiveness and pouting when she <br/>
doesn&#39;t win as ungratefulness.  I don&#39;t see it that way, but it&#39;s <br/>
harder for him to grasp the unschooling parenting concept - it was <br/>
easier to accept the unschooling school part.<br/>
<br/>
Is there a way to support her intense need for competition but still <br/>
let her know that it&#39;s ok just to have fun and not worry about who <br/>
wins or how many points you get?  I really want her to enjoy our <br/>
time together as a family, but she isn&#39;t and then hubby isn&#39;t either.<br/>
<br/>
How can I make this a win-win situation for our family?  I would <br/>
love any ideas or comments, as I&#39;m out of ideas and our family is <br/>
very frustrated.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>

How old is your daughter? My 8 year old sometimes has a hard time <br/>
with losing (or not doing as good as someone else) but my 11 year <br/>
old takes it more mature. Maybe it&#39;s an age thing? <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think that this is normal for this age.  I&#39;ve seen it in both of my<br/>
daughters at that age and by the time they were 10-is to 11-ish they<br/>
had pretty much moved beyond that point.  One of the things that I do,<br/>
though, is to play for fun myself.  To show my children that I<br/>
*really* don&#39;t play to win, but just for fun.  Bowling was a big issue<br/>
in our house.  Mary Elayne never wanted to bowl because she felt she<br/>
sucked at it.  We started going to a bowling alley that would allow us<br/>
to put the bumpers up.  She went from the Goddess of the Gutter to<br/>
&quot;hey, I *can* play this game.&quot;  Now, even though she still uses the<br/>
bumpers, she really doesn&#39;t need them.  We also started a &quot;you suck<br/>
club.&quot;  (Please realize that this was something that my kids started<br/>
and we do it all in jest and fun - not as a slander - I guess you<br/>
would have to be here to see the humor in it.)  Only people who bowled<br/>
under 75 or went bancrupt at Monopoly or had 8 children in the game of<br/>
Life or any numerous other ways was permitted in the &quot;you suck club&quot;<br/>
So for a while we were all playing to lose, which was really quite<br/>
fun.  For a while we were seeing just how many times we could lose big<br/>
time at Uno and other games.  Once we took the winning factor out of<br/>
the equation attitudes about winning changed.  Sort of a lightbulb<br/>
that was blinking, &quot;Yes you can play just for fun.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Of course it is pretty funny to see us leaving the bowling alley<br/>
chanting &quot;We suck we suck we suck&quot; and laughing about it.<br/>
