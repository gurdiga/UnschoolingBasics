<div id="ygrps-yiv-283106587">*I am posting this for a friend.  She is in Panama with twin boys in first<br/>
grade.  She had been keeping them out of school about one day a week, but<br/>
one of her boys mentioned the  dreaded word &quot;homeschooling&quot; to his teacher<br/>
and now the mom is getting backlash from the school.<br/>
<br/>
She says<br/>
&lt;&lt;I would love to bail out completely..If you happen to have any articles on<br/>
convincing a reluctant spouse to reconsider homeschooling (the objection:<br/>
would leave no free time for parent to persue own life interests), I would<br/>
be very grateful if you could send them my way.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wrote her back, but I&#39;m thinking her dh might be more receptive to<br/>
articles & writings coming from other than his spouse & her friend LOL<br/>

There are alot of really good Sandra Dodd articles on<br/>
the internet, that talk about<br/>
homeschooling/unschooling.  There should also be books<br/>
at the local library.  I hope this helps some.<br/>

What&#39;s the law in Panama? That would be my first question. If its <br/>
legal, why are they worried about the school at ALL??<br/>

Zillions of articles/essays/etc at www.SandraDodd.com/unschooling and <br/>
ReJoycing (I&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t remember that link, Joyce!) but there&#39;s a <br/>
link to it at Sandra&#39;s site.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s Live Free, Learn Free Magazine and Life learning Magazine. <br/>
There&#39;s the new e-Zine, Connections.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s John Holt and Frank Smith!<br/>
<br/>
As far as the parent&#39;s time to pursue his/her own interests---is that <br/>
the *dad&#39;s* problem? the mom&#39;s? I&#39;m not sure I understand. I pursue <br/>
LOTS of interests alone and with my kids. That&#39;s part of the deal.<br/>
<br/>
Is that the *reason* to send them to school in the first place? So that <br/>
the parents can pursue their life interests???If so, they won&#39;t make <br/>
good unschooling parents anyway. There&#39;s probably another <br/>
reason---surely?!<br/>
