<div id="ygrps-yiv-1912035613">Does anyone have any knowledge about the Pixter game?  I was told it was fun for kids.  I am thinking of getting it for my 7 year old daughter. The few reviews I got on it were that it was fun and kids get alot out of it.  My question is, is it any different than the Nintendo ds?  It looks like it has more art stuff incorporated.  Are they basically the same only that the Pixter is for the younger kids, kind of like a prelude to the ds?<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
