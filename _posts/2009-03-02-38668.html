<div id="ygrps-yiv-751064337">Since you are all talking about comic books and graphic novels<br/>
I want to ask for some recommendations.<br/>
My 6 and a half year old son loves Cat Warriors  ( the manga style) and Captain Underpants.<br/>
He really does not like books for his age but for kids around 10 years old  ( as are those two books)<br/>
Any recommendations?<br/>
<br/>
PS I absolutely am a voracious reader and read EVERYTHING for fun even Civil codes ( I went to law school) and encyclopedias.<br/>
and I LOVE Calvin and Hobbes and Asterix . Those are absolutely fantastic!<br/>
I also still love some of the comic books for kids that I read when I was a child in Brazil.<br/>
Thanks goodness my parents supported everything I liked and did not find my interests any less important.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1416947582">Bone is good for about 10 year olds. You can get games for it from Telltale Games. I can&#39;t find them there. But Sam and Max has been a favorite game here for a while. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.telltalegames.com/store/bone,">http://www.telltalegames.com/store/bone,</a> that&#39;s Bone the game links. There are Shrek comics that we bought in Australia that are fun. I just googled comic book stores near you and there are a few. I&#39;d go to Jimmy Jam&#39;s and just browse. Or go to the library, they often have comic books these days. I still love Casper and Wendy the Good Little Witch and Hot Stuff comics. There are Naruto manga. Just a thought. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1657883348">Recommendations?<br/>
 <br/>
Power Pack, about four superhero siblings aged 12, 10, 8, and 5 approximately.  Obviously written by a parent of young children.  Out of print, so it can take time to collect the whole series. (Though demand isn&#39;t that high, so they&#39;re cheap enough when you can get them.)<br/>
 <br/>
Favorite scene:  In a crossover with Cloak and Dagger, Katie, the five year old, is dissolving a wall with her superpower (I don&#39;t remember why).  &quot;I can do it myself!  Watch!  Are you watching me?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Soooooo five.  My husband laughed so hard he turned purple.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-689372263">I think books written for that age group are wriiten for children  <br/>
attempting to learn reading through force at school. they are  <br/>
unibtersting primers.<br/>
The guy who wrote Capt Underpabts Dave Pilkney (I think) also did  <br/>
Diaper Baby series. My older one read Coraline and started Neil Gaiman  <br/>
at that age. And Elf Quest, which are cool. Also LOVED Xalvin and  <br/>
Hobbes and Garfield comix<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1677586098">My son loved the Ricky Ricotta books.  They are by the same author as <br/>
the Captain Underpants books.  Each time he sorts through his books he <br/>
keeps all those, even though he doesn&#39;t read them much any more.  I <br/>
think it&#39;s that he might want to read them again, and he remembers how <br/>
much he enjoyed them.  There are also Disney books that are kind of a <br/>
comic/graphic novel/manga mixed all together that he really enjoyed. <br/>
There is a whole group of those - different volumes, different titles <br/>
and somewhat different styles between each. I can&#39;t remember the titles <br/>
but we found them at the local library. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My kids love the Power Pack.  They are by DC comics and are currently in Manga form.  Any comic book store should have some or you can ask to see if they can order one for you.  <br/>
<br/>
Bone is really good too. My 10 yo loves Bone. <br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of classics being adapted to graphic novels.  They are pretty interesting.  <br/>
<br/>
As you can tell, my family lurves comics and we have the bookshelves to prove it.  <br/>
