something.  Over there years there were actually 2 different cards.<br/>

A few years later, when I was 19 or so, she fell during a home remodeling<br/>
project and broke her back.  This lead to her filing for bankruptcy.<br/>
<br/>
A few years after that I got a copy of my credit reports after being denied<br/>
for something, and had an enormous amount of credit card debt, which made<br/>
no sense to me, because I&#39;d never gotten a credit card.  After some<br/>
research it turns out that debt was due to the card that I had been given<br/>
by my mother.  When she declared bankruptcy, the balance was put into my<br/>
name, since there had been a secondary card in my name.  I tried to fight<br/>
it, however, since i used the card, one time, after I turned 18, and had<br/>
signed the credit card receipt, this was in fact<br/>
accepting responsibility for any and all debt on the card.  I could<br/>
possibly get a lawyer and go to court to fight it, except that a lawyer<br/>
costs money.<br/>
<br/>
So, getting your child a credit card could in fact really hurt them later<br/>
in life, especially if they ever use the card after being 18 (but possibly<br/>
if they use it beforehand).  My mother never planned on claiming<br/>
bankruptcy, but she ran a very profitable home daycare, and was on bed rest<br/>
for 6 months after breaking her back, which left her no way to run the<br/>
daycare.<br/>
<br/>
If you get a card for your child, I suggest getting a secondary card off of<br/>
an account that you don&#39;t use, so that there&#39;s no (or hardly any) debt on<br/>
it if something goes horribly wrong.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-873358331">My 12 year old has a paypal master card . I feel its safer than having her carry cash yet dosent leave anyone with a bad credit report since it is actually a debit card. I keep a certain amount in her account to use at her discretion but have the security if she is out and something happens where she needs more money I can instantly transfer into her account. <br/>
