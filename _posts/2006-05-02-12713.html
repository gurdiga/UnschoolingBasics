<div id="ygrps-yiv-1817557117">My dd plays World of Warcraft (WOW) and has made several friends all <br/>
over the country.   She just found out today that one of the kids <br/>
she&#39;s met is homeschooled (not sure if it&#39;s unschooling).   He lives <br/>
in CA, named Nick, birthday Mar 5, just turned 17.<br/>
<br/>
Just wondering if anyone out there has a son who fits the profile?   <br/>
My dd and I thought it would be really interesting if so!<br/>
