<div id="ygrps-yiv-878979226">Just a few thoughts from a new unschooler...<br/>
<br/>
First point: &quot;K - 12 students&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Although, as unschoolers, we may not think of our children in this <br/>
way, the majority of the population does and this isn&#39;t going to <br/>
change any time soon. It seems that this list should be an open forum <br/>
to discuss how to handle this in a *non-combative* way. <br/>
<br/>
Second point: new unschoolers forcing their kids to do &quot;schoolwork&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying that this might not, in theory, confuse 1 - 2 newbies -<br/>
 HOWEVER - most of us who are new to this wouldn&#39;t be here <br/>
if &quot;schoolwork&quot; was what we were wanting to do with our kids. We&#39;ve <br/>
read enough (books, articles, old posts, etc.) to grasp the concept <br/>
of not forcing &quot;education&quot; on our children. <br/>
<br/>
Third point: the actual coin-flip<br/>
<br/>
My son *loves* Ben Franklin. When I read the post, I then read it to <br/>
him and he said he wanted to do it. (this, of course, led to a five <br/>
minute house search for a penny, which on any other day you can find!)<br/>
We went to the website to input our results (H3, T7)and he saw that <br/>
there were worksheets, which he didn&#39;t want to do. No forcing done on <br/>
my part. <br/>
<br/>
If he had no interest in it, I wouldn&#39;t have forced the issue. I will <br/>
admit that I would have checked back tomorrow to see the results (for <br/>
my own curiosity). After all, I&#39;m as much of a student as my son is!<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-724826917">The worksheet was nothing more then a tally sheet with Ben Franklin&#39;s<br/>
picture on it and a silly certificate you can put your name on to state the<br/>
you did the activity.<br/>
<br/>
We did a quarter because we couldn&#39;t find a penny and made a smiley face for<br/>
heads and mountains for tails.<br/>

Did you know?...<br/>
--most well-known brands of lipstick contain lead?<br/>
--air fresheners have toxic ingredients you aren&#39;t supposed to breathe?<br/>
--most household cleaners have carcinogens and neurotoxins such as<br/>
             formaldehyde, phenols and/or phosphates?<br/>
--of 2,983 everyday products, 884 have toxic chemicals?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad we switched!<br/>
We are now safer and healthier, using toxic-free products and saving money,<br/>
too. Call (212) 990-6214 for a 10 minute prerecorded presentation or contact<br/>
me directly.<br/>
