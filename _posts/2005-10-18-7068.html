<div id="ygrps-yiv-1228017433">So last night I came home to find out that one of Jio&#39;s teacher&#39;s had <br/>
come by looking to speak with me and would be back around 8p.<br/>
It was one of his resource room teachers. She did come back..<br/>
She said she was concerned about Jio (we had told the school he was <br/>
sick). She said she came not for the school. That when she came the <br/>
first time Jio told her that I was HS&#39;ing him (the school aparently <br/>
hadn&#39;t gotten the letter yet). She said she was concerned &quot;I&quot; could <br/>
handle that and that that was &quot;alot&quot; of work for me. She also said <br/>
that Jio was doing good in her class and asked if there was anything <br/>
the school could do to keep Jio there...possibly smaller class...no <br/>
homework..etc...<br/>
I told her I didn&#39;t think so. That we thought this would be best for <br/>
Jio right now and that if in the future it doesn&#39;t work out or he <br/>
wants to go back to PS that the option is always there for him. I <br/>
told her that I though that the school was good and that so were the <br/>
teachers. I told her it was Jio and his ways that didn&#39;t fit.  I <br/>
tried to explain to her the &quot;Edison-trait kids&quot;. She was very <br/>
nice..we even talked about cloth diapers (she did too). She also <br/>
didn&#39;t come to try and change my mind either. She told Jio he could <br/>
write her a letter and let her know how he&#39;s doing and that if we <br/>
wanted (and it was ok with the school) she could give Jio his <br/>
workbooks if he wanted to do them. I told her if he wanted them he <br/>
could ask her for them. I didn&#39;t feel I should get in the fact that <br/>
we were really &quot;unschooling&quot;. She seemed very understanding, but not <br/>
that understanding LOL. <br/>
If any others come or call what should I say? I think I handled the <br/>
situation well, but I can see they might try and persuade me to <br/>
change my mind. I just feel like not picking up the phone LOL<br/>
Did any of you have teachers/principals hassle you?<br/>

I had to talk to a few when I took Conor out of ps in the middle of fourth grade. I did let the phone go the the answering machine for a little while there. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 I think you handled the teacher wonderfully. There was no hostility and you didn&#39;t create any. Of course she&#39;s going to offer workbooks or whatever it is they believe in. That&#39;s okay. I think your answers were great.<br/>

Hi Rachel...I think you handled yourself GREAT! If you are questioned <br/>
further, repeat what you said the first time (and keep repeating any <br/>
other times you are questioned) and they will get the point. As for <br/>
not answering the phone....it&#39;s a good idea! Do you have an answering <br/>
machine or caller ID? Screen your calls! <br/>
<br/>
You did great!! <br/>

 <br/>
I don&#39;t think I have an answering machine that works LOL, but I will  try and <br/>
get one..maybe off freecycle. Most of the time the computer is plugged  in so <br/>
the line is busy alot LOL. And my cell phone has caller ID which is  great:)<br/>
