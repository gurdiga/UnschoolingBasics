<div id="ygrps-yiv-1196369622">Sorry for sending this to the lists.  I would have sent it to some<br/>
individual email addresses, but I didn&#39;t have them all.   I&#39;m emailing all<br/>
of you in the hopes that you can give me some encouragement and support.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have gone back to work full time, which means the children (ages 8, 7, 4,<br/>
2) will be going to school and daycare.  This is partly not my choice.  We<br/>
have been homeless this past year and were accepted into a transitional<br/>
housing program.  Part of the requirement is that both adults in the home<br/>
have to work.  So..here I am.  I thought about a night job, but they are<br/>
scarce here in the DC area, and then there&#39;s the matter of staying up all<br/>
day with energy for my children - HA!  This is the move we have to make<br/>
right now.  Add to that my children were bored and frustrated because we<br/>
weren&#39;t doing anything all day.  No trips (no funds), no classes (no funds),<br/>
etc, etc.  We spent our days in the house and I think we were all tired of<br/>
looking at our four walls.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t intend this move to be forever.  While I do love the job that I have<br/>
now, I love my children more.  Once we are out of this program we will look<br/>
for more creative ways to earn an income and create a more flexible<br/>
schedule.  Until then..how can I help my children transition?  Safiya (who<br/>
will be 9 this month) will be going into the 3rd grade instead of the 4th,<br/>
to ease some of the academic stress that she&#39;ll be facing.  This change is<br/>
hardest on her.  She has no desire to go to school at all.  Dakari (who will<br/>
be 8 in October) will be going into the 2nd grade.  He has wanted to go to<br/>
school for some time now, so he&#39;s thrilled about going.  He requires a type<br/>
or regimented structure that I&#39;m just not able to give him at home.  Khalid<br/>
(4) and Khidar (2) will be going to daycare.  I&#39;m not sure how they&#39;ll take<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
You can email me offlist so we don&#39;t clog the lists with stuff that doesn&#39;t<br/>
pertain to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
