<div id="ygrps-yiv-360975147">I was just over at the &quot;shine&quot; list, a place I can only read on a rare<br/>
occasion (high volume of posts) and never post, BUT Anne Ohman wrote<br/>
something I thought I&#39;d share a little snippet of over here.<br/>
 The post was much longer than this, but this part was really relevant<br/>
to our recent talk about school terminology and releasing schoolish<br/>
thoughts:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anne Ohman:<br/>
***The challenge comes when you try to see the view from unschooling<br/>
only using what you know ~ the tools that were handed to you ~ from<br/>
the schooled side of the world. Those definitions of life and the<br/>
world and learning that come from the schooled mindset.those are your<br/>
old tools and they&#39;re not going to work outside of the schooled<br/>
environment.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re going to vary from person to person, too. What are you holding<br/>
onto that was handed to you that you can&#39;t seem to let go of? Bring<br/>
that out and examine it. What are the brick walls that you keep<br/>
running into in life that are preventing you from growing, from<br/>
getting closer to people, from knowing your True Self?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How tight is your grip on those old tools? How willing are you to<br/>
examine and question that schooled mindset? Are you ready to face the<br/>
truth about the answers to those questions you have?******<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Good questions.<br/>
