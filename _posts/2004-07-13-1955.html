<div id="ygrps-yiv-442591108">The conversation about the &quot;other list&quot; needs to stop.<br/>
It&#39;s not helping anyone understand unschooling philosophies better.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re going to post wild claims about getting &quot;reamed&quot; at that list, expect to be called on it, as the moderators at UD are also here. I am a former moderator at that list, and it simply serves another purpose, very different from this list. Not better or worse, just different.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad those of you that don&#39;t care for that style are enjoying this new list, but saying negative things about any other list is not what this one is about. So please refrain.<br/>
There ARE lists that have been started just to whine about UD, so you can do that if you wish. Please just don&#39;t do it here.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
<br/>
