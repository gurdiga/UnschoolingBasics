<div id="ygrps-yiv-897857533">&quot;So, having said all that, I do worry that I(WE) don&#39;t have enough<br/>
education to teach/help our kids through their school years. Do any <br/>
of<br/>
you worry about this? &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Where do you feel your education is lacking? If you believe in self-<br/>
education, then you can correct the perceived deficit at any time in <br/>
your life, right?:)<br/>
With unschooling, it isn&#39;t the parent imparting knowledge to the <br/>
child, so it isn&#39;t how much the parent is &quot;educated&quot; or not that <br/>
makes the difference.<br/>
What I believe is absolutely essential, is the parents willingness <br/>
to learn, to be curious, to get excited about life, to have <br/>
interests of their own and open the world to  their child(ren).<br/>
<br/>
If you feel your child would benefit from the activities you listed, <br/>
then bring them into your home!! If you don&#39;t know how to do those <br/>
things and they sound interesting, then learn them WITH your <br/>
children. That&#39;s the wonderful healing power of unschooling...we can <br/>
have the childhood of our dreams, it&#39;s never too late.<br/>
<br/>
Whenever I&#39;ve looked at those seemingly wonderful Montessori type <br/>
programs, I see the cost and think about how much travelling, how <br/>
many supplies etc...we could buy for that fee.<br/>
Having the school for free changes that vein of thought! But if you <br/>
really think about a 4 or 5 year olds ability to be gone from their <br/>
parents, I doubt school can offer anything remotely as valuable as <br/>
having Mom nearby.<br/>
<br/>
Think about your child in terms of emotional health. What is more <br/>
beneficial? To be &quot;enriched&quot; by strangers, or simply to play in the <br/>
comfort of home?<br/>
All this &quot;enrichment&quot; is highly overrated in my opinion. Four year <br/>
olds need their parents mainly, and an interesting environment at <br/>
home.<br/>
If your child has books, movies, games, toys and a loving parent, I <br/>
don&#39;t think anything can beat that.<br/>
<br/>
This is your oldest child, so it might be hard to try and see the <br/>
perspective you will have when he&#39;s older. They don&#39;t need all these <br/>
wonderful painting, drawing, music experiences at four. They just <br/>
need to have paper, pencils, crayons, CD&#39;s and such in their home. <br/>
They can learn all of those more formal things at ANY time. <br/>
<br/>
Their life journey can take many twists and turns, it&#39;s never too <br/>
late for them to develop more of an interest in all those lovely <br/>
artistic/musical things that Montessori seems to value. <br/>
<br/>
Trust your child, trust yourself. You may understand how damaging <br/>
school can be, but you&#39;re still letting that fear send you messages.<br/>
Tell it to go away, you&#39;re doing just fine thank you.:)<br/>

the names of some barnyard animals - they first instruct the children <br/>
by telling them &quot;This is a pig. This is a horse.&quot; Then they ask, &quot;Which <br/>
is the pig? Which is the horse?&quot; Then they ask the child, &quot;What is <br/>
this? What is this?&quot; Always the same three steps.<br/>
<br/>
Do you really think that kids at home with their families need this? <br/>
They learn by experience, by asking questions, by noticing what other <br/>
people called things, by trial and error, and so on. They learn in <br/>
THEIR own ways - each unique. Learning is not a &quot;logical progression&quot; <br/>
as Montessori schools would like to make out - it happens in fits and <br/>
starts, but all the time, and it isn&#39;t always observable and it <br/>

My mother has study Maria Montessori for many years and all this lesson  and structure used in the schools here are bull. Maria rally wanted to just provide the materials and let kids do whatever they pleased to do very much like you would be &quot;strewing&quot; (SP?). No time to finish, NO lessons, No control. Its a shame that people took her philosophy and decided they still had to &quot;control&quot; the kids. <br/>
  Not saying I would put my kids in school. Maria&#39;s study was for kids that where very poor and had no parents around so it was sort of an unschooling class so kids like that had a place to go. She actually started with mentally disable kids.<br/>
  Kids did whatever they wanted and learned at their own pace and were never told what to do. She actually did not want &quot;teachers&quot; in the group but just someone to be there if the kids had any questions. The groups were also mixed and not separated by age.<br/>
  I have read someof her books and all I have read about people here that have their kids in Montessori school is a shame.<br/>

If I&#39;m remembering correctly, her son (maybe) took over the schools <br/>
when she died and he&#39;s responsible for the shift in philosophy.<br/>

These ARE the currently-existing real Montessori schools  that I&#39;m <br/>

the people who run them are Joy and Charles Turner (except Charles <br/>

Montessori Accreditation Council for Teacher Education [MACTE]. Last I <br/>
knew, Joy Turner was editor of Montessori Life, the American Montessori <br/>
Society&#39;s journal. They know Montessori.<br/>
<br/>
I know all about other schools that just use some Montessori equipment <br/>
and call themselves Montessori, but that is not what I&#39;m talking about <br/>
at all.<br/>
<br/>
Please tell me which parts of my description are inaccurate portrayals <br/>
of the Montessori Method - they don&#39;t use the &quot;Three-Period Lesson&quot; to <br/>
teach? They encourage fantasy play with the pink tower blocks? There <br/>
are many &quot;right ways&quot; to do things? Self-correcting doesn&#39;t mean that <br/>
the beans spill when the child moves them with a spoon from one bowl to <br/>
another?<br/>
<br/>
Kids in PRESCHOOL Montessori schools DO get free choice from the <br/>
available activities. At the beginning of a school year there will be <br/>
fewer activities available, because they have to be introduced to them <br/>
with the three-period lesson before the kids can be free to choose <br/>
them, but once the are available, the kids can work with whatever <br/>
materials they choose for as long as they choose. But look at the <br/>
activities - they are all very &quot;logically&quot; constructed to lead kids to <br/>
work with them in certain ways to teach them certain specific things. <br/>
That&#39;s why they need lessons on how to use them BEFORE they&#39;re allowed <br/>
to &quot;work&quot; with them (they don&#39;t use the word, &quot;play&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
The elementary schools are different, though. They have a curriculum <br/>
and the kids have to do it. They give them a lot of leeway in choosing <br/>
when they do it - what order they do it and they can spend a day on <br/>
math and another day on science, for example, but they don&#39;t get to <br/>
choose not to do it at all.<br/>
<br/>
Somebody&#39;s mother&#39;s interpretation of what Maria Montessori really <br/>
meant isn&#39;t of use to someone thinking of putting their kid into a real <br/>
Montessori school. They need to know and think about what the schools <br/>
are really like.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This really got to me when my oldest dd was in a Montesorri school.  <br/>
She is very hands on, let me figure it out on my own type of child <br/>
and she became frustrated when she had to sit and be told (directed) <br/>
how to use something.  She couldn&#39;t just go and touch and feel and <br/>
explore it and learn by trial and error.  Each station in the room <br/>
had a direct and orderly way in which it was to be used.  No <br/>
variation on a them.  Step 1, step 2, step 3 in that order always.  <br/>
If a child skipped to step 3, he was directed back to step 1 to <br/>
start again.  <br/>
<br/>
I think most children learn better when they work it out <br/>
themselves.  Some will ask for direction and want to know the steps <br/>
while others want to know what the end product is and then be left <br/>
alone to figure out how to get from point A to point B and still <br/>
other children just want the tools and to be left alone to explore <br/>
it and manipulate it to its fullest extent.  They are all valid <br/>
forms of learning, but when you are in school, even the best of <br/>
schools, rarely are you given the freedom to choose how you wish to <br/>
learn.  You are taught using one formula (usually that which the <br/>
teacher learns easiest through or has been taught to teach.)  <br/>
<br/>
One thing that I hear often from my mother is, &quot;Think how much <br/>
better your children would be in school!&quot;  In her world if they are <br/>
so brilliant and wonderful without school then *certainly* they <br/>
would be even more brilliant and more wonderful in school.  In <br/>
actuality, I think that they would be less brilliant and less <br/>
wonderful.  <br/>
<br/>
Do I have all the knowledge needed to teach my children everything <br/>
that they need to know?  No.  I&#39;ll freely admit it. What I do have <br/>
is the ability to provide for them the resources and opportunities <br/>
to learn the things that they want.  I now about a thimble full of <br/>
information on ancient Egypt, yet my 12 yo can talk circles around <br/>
me on the subject.  Everything from the religion to kings and <br/>
successions and how pyramids were built and what copic jars were <br/>
for.  When she said she wanted to learn about Egypt, we went to the <br/>
library, checked out a few dozen (probably hundred by now) books on <br/>
Egypt, found cool and interesting websites about Egypt and drew <br/>
reams of pages of hieroglyphs.  (And I still know squat about Egypt <br/>
LOL!)  So one doesn&#39;t need to know everything about everything in <br/>
order to properly provide for their children.  <br/>

I do agree with you.Montessori schools suck and schools in general suck. I was saying that Maria Montessori&#39;s philosophy is NOT what they do in Montessori schools. I have read many of her books and talked with my mom about it and I think Maria Montessori would be surprised about the what they do in schools here. She says &quot;teachers&quot; are not in class to teach anything!! She says kids learn a lot more when doing real work. Just like with do with our kids. We bake with them , we do our garden with them. All that using real tools and not toys. I will say it again that Montessori schools are a bunch of b**l ! Maria Montessori was a lot more about unschooling than most people know, specially the trained Montessori teachers!<br/>

<br/>
But ---<br/>
<br/>
Some of our kids spend most of their time playing, not working. And <br/>
they learn from that play.<br/>
My kids spent hours and hours and hours and hours and even MORE hours <br/>
in fantasy/pretend play.  They played with stuffed animals and with <br/>
dress-ups and with pretend foods/cash register/toy stove, etc. And <br/>
dolls and dollhouses. I&#39;m not talking about just when they were 3 to 5, <br/>
but my 14 year old STILL plays with all her little toy animals and her <br/>
fake foods and toy cars. My 17 yo only stopped playing pretend with her <br/>
stuffed animals about a year ago.<br/>
<br/>
Our kids have the luxury of extended childhoods - lucky lucky kids who <br/>
are able to take advantage of it. I feel like mine really got the MOST <br/>
from being children.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not explaining it well, but I just fall back on this: &quot;Childhood is <br/>
not a dress rehearsal for adulthood. It is a stage of life that is just <br/>
as valid as any other.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
My kids are 8 and 10 and are still big into pretend play.  I&#39;ve noticed that<br/>
a couple kids they used to play with, ages 10 and 12, who used to pretend<br/>
play with them all the time, don&#39;t pretend play anymore.  (at least not when<br/>
I am around)  They both seem to want to grow up early (be seen as cool) and<br/>
they seem to mimic the teenagers they know.  My kids tend to seek out kids<br/>
who still enjoy pretend play and sometimes they even pull other older kids<br/>
into their pretend play. (because they are having so much fun!)  We were at<br/>
the barn the other day and a 12.5 year old girl joined in their pretend<br/>
horsey play.  At first she must have been a little embarrassed because she<br/>
commented that she was playing with the *little* kids but after a few<br/>
minutes, they were all playing together really well and just having a great<br/>
time and the age difference didn&#39;t matter.  The next time she came to the<br/>
barn she brought a friend.  She was excited to play horses with my girls<br/>
again.  She asked her friend if she wanted to play and at first the friend<br/>
declined.  It wasn&#39;t long though before they were all playing horses and<br/>
having a great time. (I took it upon myself to leave the alone so they&#39;d be<br/>
more comfortable playing.)  Clearly, they felt it was a babyish thing to do<br/>
at first, but they also clearly enjoyed it once they joined in.  I think<br/>
it&#39;s sad that kids feel the need to be grownup so soon that they give up<br/>
pretend play before they are ready so people won&#39;t think they are babyish.<br/>
I am sure that personality also plays a part in when children give up<br/>
pretend play, but it seems to me that many times they give it up because<br/>
they perceive it as babyish and they don&#39;t want to look uncool.   <br/>

(Society for Creative Anachronism) are so popular.  It&#39;s a way for <br/>
older kids (and adults) to have that imaginary play without feeling <br/>
like they are still playing with dolls and building blocks.  I&#39;ve <br/>
seen teens that have really gotten into the SCA with elaborate <br/>
costumes and enriched personae.  They turn into little authenticity <br/>
mavins at very early ages.  But they get engrossed in it and bloom <br/>
in it.  They could talk forever on heraldry, weaponry, medieval <br/>
history, naming practices, costuming, cooking, jewelry, alchemy, and <br/>
medieval careers.  Then their parents (if they aren&#39;t in the SCA or <br/>
if they don&#39;t understand the value of what their child has learned) <br/>
will tell them they are too into it.  Sad.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2144934411">I am trying to unschool my now 8 y/o daughter the best I understand how.  I still have this underlying niggeling anxiety that I try my best to ignore.  My daughter is enjoying &quot;homeschooling&quot; very much.  She loves to play with her baby dolls alot.  If I did not run out of energy she would play all day and even forgo eating sometimes.  If I say lets stop for a rest and do something else such as eating, or going out or playing a game etc., she gets very upset.  She will sometimes tell me that I hardly played when we&#39;d been playing for hours.  <br/>
I mostly enjoy playing with her except after a while I do need a break.  It&#39;s hard pretending to be a &quot;mom&quot; and pretend to do the things that I have to do in real life, for hours.  My brain just needs to be more stimulated.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, when we play, I pretty much follow her lead.  I was wondering if it is ok to try and incorporate a bit more complex situations into the play.  For instance, when we play that she is a teenager who works as a checkout person, is it all right to actually ask how much things cost and have her add them together?  She played that once or twice but started being upset about adding the amounts together.  She&#39;ll tell me not to bother with that and just make up pretend numbers or say we are not playing like that.  It&#39;s like she&#39;d rather just go thru the motions in general but no headwork..  I feel that this may be an opportunity to incorporate some more thinking into the play she already likes to do, seeing as we don&#39;t have many opportunities to work with numbers.  In general, she mentally shuts down and refuses to hear any discussion or even a comment about numbers.  <br/>
<br/>
Is it normal for a kid to want to play so much pretend?  We&#39;ve been doing this for years already.  She does not tire of it.  I know kids get some benefit from playing and are ultimately learning something that they need and that it may not always be recognizable to us, as parents.  But,shouldn&#39;t she have worked out any issues or figured out what she needs to by now? I know its a weird question but this playing is almost an obssesion with her.  If it were up to her we&#39;d play all day and never see daylight(of course it can&#39;t be played anywhere else but at home, believe me I&#39;ve tried)and forgo eating.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking maybe its something I&#39;m just not seeing. Any thoughts on this would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much.<br/>

world exists, can&#39;t choose to participate unless we run it through  <br/>
their lives.<br/>
<br/>
But if it upsets her, rather than making it an &quot;us&quot; thing, let her  <br/>
know you need to do something. Let her know you&#39;ll be back at a  <br/>
specific time and stick to that. You may try listening to your tone.  <br/>
It could be you&#39;ve got a pleading tone as though asking her to agree  <br/>
with you. If you want to go throw in a load of laundry, say it the  <br/>
way you&#39;d say you need to go to the bathroom.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than taking a break for food, do you know about monkey platters:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/monkeyplatters/">http://sandradodd.com/monkeyplatters/</a><br/>
<br/>
(Click on the link for explanations.)<br/>
<br/>
Rather than interrupting her play to do something, have you made  <br/>
plans for the next day?<br/>
<br/>
How about asking on a local homeschooling list for kids who have a  <br/>
similar bent?<br/>
<br/>
Or how about an older child who would like to be paid as a mother&#39;s  <br/>
helper and play with her for a couple hours a week?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She will sometimes tell me that I hardly played when we&#39;d been  <br/>
&gt; playing for hours.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And she&#39;s letting you know that hours feels like moments to her :-)  <br/>
People respond to what the world feels like to them, not to the  <br/>
perception someone else thinks they should have. (Though they can  <br/>
learn to fake it or decide their feelings are wrong to please someone  <br/>
else.)<br/>
<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are some things that are realities like eating, keeping the  <br/>
house at least livable, cleanish clothes and dishes.<br/>
<br/>
Some things are in the attitude we face them with. Yes, it&#39;s hard to  <br/>
do what you&#39;re doing. Focusing on how hard it is makes it harder.  <br/>
Rather than trying to pull away from her to meet your needs, find a  <br/>
time to carve out for yourself. Early in the morning. Or an evening a  <br/>
week take a class or go to the bookstore to read. Or while a mother&#39;s  <br/>
helper is entertaining her.<br/>
<br/>
If circumstances  limit the possibilities, see this as a season -- a  <br/>
really long season! -- in your life. Puberty will be coming and she  <br/>
will change.<br/>

husband decided you needed some math exercise, would it be okay for  <br/>
him to ask what the measurements would be if you doubled the recipes?  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>She is doing headwork! It&#39;s just not the kind you&#39;re looking for.  <br/>
Constructing stories, sifting through possibilities (which *is*  <br/>
math), and working through relationships is a lot of headwork.  <br/>
Writing novels is hard work. Just because you can&#39;t see the work --  <br/>
especially since it seems effortless to her -- it doesn&#39;t mean her  <br/>
brain isn&#39;t going a mile a minute sifting and weighing possibilities.<br/>

<br/>
Have you seen:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/math/luz">http://sandradodd.com/math/luz</a><br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of social type video games that people here probably  <br/>
know of. Animal Crossing is great (and involves saving and paying for  <br/>
things). Harvest Moon.<br/>
<br/>
Focus not on pulling her away from what she&#39;s doing. See your role as  <br/>
adding to her life. She gets to choose, though.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; In general, she mentally shuts down and refuses to hear any  <br/>
&gt; discussion or even a comment about numbers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you want her to dislike numbers and math, keep pushing them.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not being snarky! The more you push, the more she&#39;ll associate  <br/>
numbers with your pushing and the feelings that rouses in her. So  <br/>
when she encounters them naturally in her life, she&#39;ll be more likely  <br/>
to pull away and avoid them. It&#39;s what schooled kids do.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not abnormal. For some kids, some passions last for years and years.  <br/>
My daughter pretty much lived and breathed Pokemon and the creatures  <br/>
she made up from them for .... 8 years maybe? At 18 she&#39;s still  <br/>
pretty much doing the same thing just with made up stories about 80&#39;s  <br/>
rock stars with others she&#39;s met online through Deviantart. :-)<br/>
<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Whenever &quot;shouldn&#39;t she&quot; questions come up, it&#39;s a good sign a parent  <br/>
is comparing a child to their vision of what other kids are like and  <br/>
not facing the child herself.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe don&#39;t look at it as learning if you see learning as finite,  <br/>
like a chunk of knowledge contained in a textbook. Look at it as  <br/>
exploring. She&#39;s exploring relationships, culture and social  <br/>
interactions. That&#39;s pretty much an unlimited field!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If it were up to her we&#39;d play all day and never see daylight(of  <br/>
&gt; course it can&#39;t be played anywhere else but at home, believe me  <br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Rather than her way or your way, somewhere in the middle is  <br/>
partnership. Maybe if you could give some specific examples of what  <br/>
happens when you try incorporating something else into her life goes,  <br/>
others might be able to see a dynamic that you&#39;re missing.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Is it normal for a kid to want to play so much pretend? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Absolutely! The bigger issue seems to be that she&#39;s wanting the play with you, and you&#39;re getting tired. Will she play with anyone else? Are there kids or even other adults you can arrange play dates with? That was something we did with Ray when he was younger and soooooo social. He was active, too, so we looked for active young people who could play at 90mph!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I mostly enjoy playing with her except after a while I do need a break.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I totally understand! Have you talked with her about this? I think Ray was six or seven when we started talking about the needs of introverts vs extraverts. He really didn&#39;t know that Everyone in the whole world didn&#39;t love to socialize Allllll the time! Why would he think that? He loved to socialize, after all. So we explained about George and I needing quiet time and time by ourselves, let him know that it was about us, not him, something we needed so that we could be better at the social stuff. He offered us some time in the mornings, when he&#39;d play in his room by himself until a certain time, then we&#39;d have breakfast together and the day&#39;s social marathon would begin. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;If I say lets stop for a rest and do something else such as eating, or going out or playing a game etc., she gets very upset. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>**************<br/>
<br/>
Bring food where the play is - or vice versa. Joyce gave you the link on monkey platters. You could also suggest moving the play to wherever you need to get some work done. Bring toys into the kitchen and play while you get food ready. Offer to play something that lets you get the laundry done at the same time. Make it as much of a win-win as you can by saying &quot;I want to keep playing, but I also want to do xyz, how can we do both?&quot; You might also start the day with a plan: &quot;I want to do these things today, how can we do that and play at the same time?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also, when we play, I pretty much follow her lead.  I was wondering if it is ok to try and incorporate a bit more complex situations into the play.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>****************<br/>
<br/>
Only if its fun for her. Otherwise you&#39;re interrupting something she&#39;s very busy doing - learning! Her learning isn&#39;t going to look like you expect. Its going to look like play. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; It&#39;s like she&#39;d rather just go thru the motions in general but no headwork.. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some kids learn to speak by getting an overview of language but not bothering with words for years. Some kids learn to write by &quot;pretend writing&quot; for years, picking up the overview of what writing looks like before ever troubling with words or spelling. Do you see where I&#39;m going with this? Going through the motions in a general way Is a learning strategy. It just doesn&#39;t look like you thought it would.<br/>
<br/>
When I read a book, I generally skim through the first time, just to get the plot in my head and all the characters sorted out. That&#39;s it. It took me years not to feel bad about that, because school insists that you start pulling books apart from the first page. Is this foreshadowing? Is that a metaphor? I like looking for all that literary hoo-haa the second and third and fortieth times through (I&#39;m a chronic re-reader). You can think of the way your dd is learning along those lines, if you like. She wants the whole picture, first, and will gradually add details as she&#39;s ready for them. They may not be the details you expect! As Joyce pointed out, she may be far more into parsing out the details of a social interaction than the numbers, and that&#39;s okay. She&#39;s learning what&#39;s important to her right now. <br/>
<br/>
For that matter, if she&#39;s wanting to learn about mathematics globally then throwing numbers at her is only confusing the issue, in her mind. She&#39;s not ready for that. She&#39;s still internalizing what numbers and patterns Do, what they&#39;re For. She&#39;s learning the big concepts and will plug numbers into that later. Don&#39;t scare her away from those numbers! <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Passions can look obsessive, sometimes. Play is how children learn. My 8yo plays pretty much all day long, although she&#39;s more of an introvert than Ray was at the same age (whew! once was enough! I really do sympathize!). What Kinds of things does you dd play? Maybe we can help you see the variety of things she&#39;s learning about. You said baby dolls and a cashier game, those are pretty different avenues of learning, what else does she like? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-738780324">Hi Rebecca,<br/>
I have to start saying that she is VERY lucky to have a mom like you. I have a very good mother but I don&#39;t have any memories of her playing with me at all...I remember playing cards when I was older. <br/>
May be your daughter would like some theatre/ acting classes?<br/>
Have a friend come over or let her play by herself...She is old enough to do that. And you can take a break if you need to. It is important that everybody&#39;s needs are cover including your needs.<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

                  I am trying to unschool my now 8 y/o daughter the best I understand how.  I still have this underlying niggeling anxiety that I try my best to ignore.  My daughter is enjoying &quot;homeschooling&quot; very much.  She loves to play with her baby dolls alot.  If I did not run out of energy she would play all day and even forgo eating sometimes.  If I say lets stop for a rest and do something else such as eating, or going out or playing a game etc., she gets very upset.  She will sometimes tell me that I hardly played when we&#39;d been playing for hours.  <br/>
<br/>
I mostly enjoy playing with her except after a while I do need a break.  It&#39;s hard pretending to be a &quot;mom&quot; and pretend to do the things that I have to do in real life, for hours.  My brain just needs to be more stimulated.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, when we play, I pretty much follow her lead.  I was wondering if it is ok to try and incorporate a bit more complex situations into the play.  For instance, when we play that she is a teenager who works as a checkout person, is it all right to actually ask how much things cost and have her add them together?  She played that once or twice but started being upset about adding the amounts together.  She&#39;ll tell me not to bother with that and just make up pretend numbers or say we are not playing like that.  It&#39;s like she&#39;d rather just go thru the motions in general but no headwork..  I feel that this may be an opportunity to incorporate some more thinking into the play she already likes to do, seeing as we don&#39;t have many opportunities to work with numbers.  In general, she mentally shuts down and refuses to hear any discussion or even a comment about numbers.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Is it normal for a kid to want to play so much pretend?  We&#39;ve been doing this for years already.  She does not tire of it.  I know kids get some benefit from playing and are ultimately learning something that they need and that it may not always be recognizable to us, as parents.  But,shouldn&#39; t she have worked out any issues or figured out what she needs to by now? I know its a weird question but this playing is almost an obssesion with her.  If it were up to her we&#39;d play all day and never see daylight(of course it can&#39;t be played anywhere else but at home, believe me I&#39;ve tried)and forgo eating.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking maybe its something I&#39;m just not seeing. Any thoughts on this would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2044786288">Thank you Meredith and Joyce,<br/>
 <br/>
You&#39;ve given me much insight.  It helps me feel better to know that even if it is difficult on my part, that this is exactly what she needs at this moment in her life.  It makes it easier to just let go and go with the flow and know that it is the right thing.<br/>
 <br/>
There is a couple of things that maybe I did not explain too well.  My dd is a very determined girl and sometimes she&#39;ll make up &quot;rules&quot; as to how we play that are a bit restrictive to me but she knows it will get her my full attention. (I think).  For instance,  I&#39;ve suggested many times that we continue playing while I make dinner.  I could very easily &quot;talk&quot; for the dolls while doing that.  I just wouldn&#39;t be able to move them around.  Most of the time they just sit and &quot;talk&quot;anyway.  Or, I&#39;ll tell her, when we have to run an errand, that we can continue playing in the car or anywhere else as we do what we need to.  We&#39;ll just take them along.  That works occassionally, however, mostly its &quot;no, we&#39;ll play when we get back&quot;.  Then its &quot;how much longer&quot;,  &quot;can we go home now and play dolls&quot; Or  she&#39;ll bargain with me and say &quot; ok, we&#39;ll go out.  But you can only go one place and afterwards you have to play with me for 6 hours.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Also, you guys make it sound like its so easy to go for a bathroom break!   If I just get up and go she&#39;ll drill me as to what I&#39;ll be doing in there and will literally be upset if its anything more than a short pee.  Forget telling her matter of factly about having to throw in a basket of laundry.  I get an attitude from her if I fold laundry and tell her &quot;let&#39;s continue playing, I can still talk for the babies&quot;, or whatever we&#39;d be playing at the moment.  <br/>
 <br/>
She makes rules, such as, the playing can only take place on the living room carpet or dining room carpet and occasionally the steps is allowed.  It cannot be on  any couches or in the kitchen and I cannot be doing anything that even looks like a distraction.  Like sometimes I&#39;ll try thumbing thru a magazine or book while my &quot;kids&quot; are sleeping.  That is not allowed.  ( I&#39;m laughing as I write this, as it seems funny now)  I think she makes these rules so that I pay the strictest attention and that I remain focused and serious and not fall asleep.  I may tell her my back hurts from sitting on the floor so much (the truth). So then she&#39;ll allow me to sit on a folding chair, but no couch.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m laughing now as I talk about this craziness but I do wonder if she is not manipulating the situation.  Does anyone else have it this crazy?<br/>
 <br/>
Its not like she doesn&#39;t have anything else she likes to do.  We have plenty of games and manipulative toys and puzzles and of course the computer, and she loves art.  I have many different art stuff like crayons, markers, acrylic paint, water color, etc and she loves doing it.  What always amazes me is that when I am busyy with housework she prefers TV over anything else.  She will only do those things if I am doing them with her.  But then we come back to the same thing. If I am with her she&#39;d rather play pretend.  That&#39;s another thing that frustrates me is that if I&#39;m busy she will watch TV to the point where she is bored of it but will continue watching if I&#39;m not done rather than picking up another activity for a change.<br/>
 <br/>
When she has a friend over she&#39;ll refuse to play pretend with any of them.  She may color,paint or do arts and crafts, play ball sometimes dress up but with no dolls.  Everything but dolls.  When I ask her why not, especially when the other kids would love to play with her dolls, she just says its not the same as playing with me.  I think maybe its because she has such an attachment to some of her dolls that they are like her kids and the other kid will turn it into something else.  Then again, I could be wrong.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Sorry about rambling so, but I guess I never sorted all this out.  You guys had asked me what kinds of play does she do when we pretend.  We&#39;ll its mostly babies.  She keeps getting pregnant, having a big stomach and then giving &quot;birth&quot;  and of course she is the best mommy ever.  Nurses them, diapers, takes care when they are sick...  She even went so far as to get nursing books out of the library and so now she knows how to nurse twins as well!  Sometimes its one baby, other times it could be as many as 8, octuplets!  and of course she takes care of shopping, cleaning, cooking etc.  <br/>
 <br/>
Sometimes she&#39;ll switch to being a big sister and we go thru her growing into a teenager year by year,  then she&#39;ll get her drivers license, job, and/or college... we even have a wedding ceremony, and then of course there are the babies!  That&#39;s basically the theme nowadays.  Occasionally it will vary with the jobs or things she does as she &quot;grows&quot; in the game.  Like she might be learning ballet, or she&#39;s a great artist from Paris, or a checkout person, or a doctor, vet, various therapists, librarian or rock star,etc.  And let me tell you she goes all out.  She tries to dress the part as authentically as possible.  (I do have a mountain of dress up clothes along with make up.  When she doesn&#39;t find what shes looking for there, there is always my closet that she raids..)<br/>
 <br/>
I know some day I&#39;ll look back at these days with fond memories.  I do already see how her pretend play has evolved, and that&#39;s one reason why I continue it.  I know that&#39;s where she got her strong thinking skills. She is also able to speak very well.  It always amazes me how she&#39;s able to hold a conversation with adults and its only afterwards that they tell me that they had to remind themselves that this is a 7/8 year old.  She&#39;s able to offer advice and suggestions and reassurances that are wise beyond her years.  I attribute that to the &quot;conversations&quot; we have when we play.  We resolve &quot;issues&quot; or talk about many things when I come to &quot;visit&quot;etc<br/>
 <br/>
You are right when you say that it may not always look like what we want learning to look like, but it is there.  Thank you for reminding me.  Its nice to have a bit of encouragement and to be set back on track when we get a bit lost and our vision gets a bit out of focus.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-647932148">Another reason she may not want to play w/ friends is that they won&#39;t give her the same absolute control of the situation that you do.  While some children will give the other child control, most want to have say in the situation and work out the plot of their dramatic play together.  This can lead to conflict, but learning to resolve that conflict is part of learning how relationships work.       <br/>

<br/>
Thanks for clarifying this - it sounds like she has a pretty big need for attention. That can be really challenging! I know!<br/>
<br/>
How are you dealing with her &quot;attitude&quot; as you call it? Are you walking on tiptoes trying not to set her off? Sometimes it can be better, in terms of being less stressful all around, to learn to be okay with the knowledge that, whatever you do, there are going to be rough parts to the day, maybe even meltdowns. A lot of tension can go into trying to avoid those kinds of situations, and yet that very tension can make it harder to communicate openly, to comiserate with an unhappy child even when you&#39;re the trigger for that unhappiness. <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>***************<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like maybe you&#39;ve given some unclear messages to her about what your boundaries are, and she&#39;s taking advantage of that. Its good to stretch one&#39;s boundaries with young children, and kids with bigger needs, but its not good to become a doormat in the process! If you&#39;re okay with sitting in the folding chair, that&#39;s one thing, but if you need to be on the couch to be comfortable, then that&#39;s Not really okay. Your boundaries matter. <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve been downplaying your own needs to avoid meltdowns, its good to notice that and be clearer about what your needs and boundaries are. The goal in unschooling isn&#39;t to create an environment where a child is never unhappy, never has a meltdown. In fact, part of what unschooling can offer children is a safe environment in which to learn about dealing with big, negative emotions. Unlike conventional parenting, we&#39;re not setting kids up to fail and experience those negative emotions, but we&#39;re also not trying to get rid of disappointment and frustration entirely - for one thing its not possible! And for another, its not healthy. Negative emotions are a part of life, and kids can learn to have better tools for dealing with those feelings by having a sympathetic parent supporting them during those times.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, you haven&#39;t given much in the way of detail in that area so I may be going off on a complete tangent to your issues - if so, nevermind! <br/>

You are totally right and I never thought it that way since people always tell you what we are supposed to be doing or ready at certain age . I guess I meant safety wise, she won&#39;t put anything in her mouth and choke. I was thinking about when I was 8 and I had 2 brothers to play with especially the younger one...we pretend play a lot...I I didn&#39;t have him I don&#39;t know what would I&#39;ve done...<br/>
I&#39;m sorry...I was just trying to help. Maybe since I don&#39;t have a daughter that age I shouldn&#39;t have said anything...<br/>

Until I say &quot;no, I need a break&quot; or it&#39;s too hot or I have to do X. He may be unhappy with that decision for a moment but he goes on to the next activity. <br/>
<br/>
And I am really right there. I am just on this side of the doorway while he&#39;s on the other.<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m getting a break and taking care of other things. And cooling down -- a factor around here.<br/>

&gt; Thank you Meredith and Joyce,<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; You&#39;ve given me much insight.  It helps me feel better to know that even if it is difficult on my part, that this is exactly what she needs at this moment in her life.  It makes it easier to just let go and go with the flow and know that it is the right thing.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; There is a couple of things that maybe I did not explain too well.  My dd is a very determined girl and sometimes she&#39;ll make up &quot;rules&quot; as to how we play that are a bit restrictive to me but she knows it will get her my full attention. (I think).  For instance,  I&#39;ve suggested many times that we continue playing while I make dinner.  I could very easily &quot;talk&quot; for the dolls while doing that.  I just wouldn&#39;t be able to move them around.  Most of the time they just sit and &quot;talk&quot;anyway.  Or, I&#39;ll tell her, when we have to run an errand, that we can continue playing in the car or anywhere else as we do what we need to.  We&#39;ll just take them along.  That works occassionally, however, mostly its &quot;no, we&#39;ll play when we get back&quot;.  Then its &quot;how much longer&quot;,  &quot;can we go home now and play dolls&quot; Or  she&#39;ll bargain with me and say &quot; ok, we&#39;ll go out.  But you can only go one place and afterwards you have to play with me for 6 hours.&quot;<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Also, you guys make it sound like its so easy to go for a bathroom break!   If I just get up and go she&#39;ll drill me as to what I&#39;ll be doing in there and will literally be upset if its anything more than a short pee.  Forget telling her matter of factly about having to throw in a basket of laundry.  I get an attitude from her if I fold laundry and tell her &quot;let&#39;s continue playing, I can still talk for the babies&quot;, or whatever we&#39;d be playing at the moment.  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; She makes rules, such as, the playing can only take place on the living room carpet or dining room carpet and occasionally the steps is allowed.  It cannot be on  any couches or in the kitchen and I cannot be doing anything that even looks like a distraction.  Like sometimes I&#39;ll try thumbing thru a magazine or book while my &quot;kids&quot; are sleeping.  That is not allowed.  ( I&#39;m laughing as I write this, as it seems funny now)  I think she makes these rules so that I pay the strictest attention and that I remain focused and serious and not fall asleep.  I may tell her my back hurts from sitting on the floor so much (the truth). So then she&#39;ll allow me to sit on a folding chair, but no couch.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m laughing now as I talk about this craziness but I do wonder if she is not manipulating the situation.  Does anyone else have it this crazy?<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Its not like she doesn&#39;t have anything else she likes to do.  We have plenty of games and manipulative toys and puzzles and of course the computer, and she loves art.  I have many different art stuff like crayons, markers, acrylic paint, water color, etc and she loves doing it.  What always amazes me is that when I am busyy with housework she prefers TV over anything else.  She will only do those things if I am doing them with her.  But then we come back to the same thing. If I am with her she&#39;d rather play pretend.  That&#39;s another thing that frustrates me is that if I&#39;m busy she will watch TV to the point where she is bored of it but will continue watching if I&#39;m not done rather than picking up another activity for a change.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; When she has a friend over she&#39;ll refuse to play pretend with any of them.  She may color,paint or do arts and crafts, play ball sometimes dress up but with no dolls.  Everything but dolls.  When I ask her why not, especially when the other kids would love to play with her dolls, she just says its not the same as playing with me.  I think maybe its because she has such an attachment to some of her dolls that they are like her kids and the other kid will turn it into something else.  Then again, I could be wrong.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Sorry about rambling so, but I guess I never sorted all this out.  You guys had asked me what kinds of play does she do when we pretend.  We&#39;ll its mostly babies.  She keeps getting pregnant, having a big stomach and then giving &quot;birth&quot;  and of course she is the best mommy ever.  Nurses them, diapers, takes care when they are sick...  She even went so far as to get nursing books out of the library and so now she knows how to nurse twins as well!  Sometimes its one baby, other times it could be as many as 8, octuplets!  and of course she takes care of shopping, cleaning, cooking etc.  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Sometimes she&#39;ll switch to being a big sister and we go thru her growing into a teenager year by year,  then she&#39;ll get her drivers license, job, and/or college... we even have a wedding ceremony, and then of course there are the babies!  That&#39;s basically the theme nowadays.  Occasionally it will vary with the jobs or things she does as she &quot;grows&quot; in the game.  Like she might be learning ballet, or she&#39;s a great artist from Paris, or a checkout person, or a doctor, vet, various therapists, librarian or rock star,etc.  And let me tell you she goes all out.  She tries to dress the part as authentically as possible.  (I do have a mountain of dress up clothes along with make up.  When she doesn&#39;t find what shes looking for there, there is always my closet that she raids..)<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I know some day I&#39;ll look back at these days with fond memories.  I do already see how her pretend play has evolved, and that&#39;s one reason why I continue it.  I know that&#39;s where she got her strong thinking skills. She is also able to speak very well.  It always amazes me how she&#39;s able to hold a conversation with adults and its only afterwards that they tell me that they had to remind themselves that this is a 7/8 year old.  She&#39;s able to offer advice and suggestions and reassurances that are wise beyond her years.  I attribute that to the &quot;conversations&quot; we have when we play.  We resolve &quot;issues&quot; or talk about many things when I come to &quot;visit&quot;etc<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; You are right when you say that it may not always look like what we want learning to look like, but it is there.  Thank you for reminding me.  Its nice to have a bit of encouragement and to be set back on track when we get a bit lost and our vision gets a bit out of focus.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes it is. And it&#39;s unfortunate it&#39;s hard to describe how to say yes  <br/>
to kids without implying parents should never say no.<br/>
<br/>
But &quot;No&quot; is also the word of conventional parenting. For parents who  <br/>
are mostly familiar with conventional parenting &quot;I don&#39;t want to&quot;  <br/>
isn&#39;t a reliable guide for building relationships on when to say  <br/>
&quot;No.&quot; Even &quot;I can&#39;t&quot; isn&#39;t a great guide because people tend to hang  <br/>
onto familiar ways of doing things and have old scripts running in  <br/>
the heads on why something isn&#39;t possible. That&#39;s what makes the  <br/>
lists valuable since people can run a situation past objective eyes  <br/>
and get some fresh approaches.<br/>

<br/>
Why would you let anyone decide when/how you go to the bathroom!! That&#39;s beyond manipulation and into YOU not expressing personal boundaries! &quot;I need to go pee now&quot; stated clearly and expressed fully is GOOD. You&#39;re not doing her any favors if she decides how you should sit, when you should go pee etc...I don&#39;t decide those things for my children and they don&#39;t decide for ME. <br/>
<br/>
State YOUR preferences. If you&#39;re in the bathroom and she has access to you, then there&#39;s no good reason you shouldn&#39;t do what you need to do! If my child was not happy about me going to the bathroom I would have no problem saying &quot;You&#39;ll have to wait, *I* need to go to the bathroom!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Being clear in your own preferences is healthy. She needs to see that modeled even if it&#39;s hard sometimes.<br/>
