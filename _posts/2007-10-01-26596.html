<div id="ygrps-yiv-1485787255">Hello to all,<br/>
I have a 2 year old son that is starting to pick his nose (and do <br/>
unmentionable things with the finds, LOL--I can&#39;t even say it!!) and I <br/>
don&#39;t know how best to handle it.  He is not very verbal (just turned <br/>
2).  The only somewhat respectful thing I can think to say is to ask <br/>
him to do it elsewhere, but it&#39;s not something he&#39;d understand.  I <br/>
offer him a tissue or burp cltha dn help him wipe his nose, but it <br/>
doesn&#39;t help.  <br/>
<br/>
How would you all handle situations related to bad/socially <br/>
inappropriate habits in such a young child? It really bugs me/grosses <br/>
me out to see it as well and I can hear him doing it while we are <br/>
laying down in the dark to go to bed--it&#39;s really driving me nuts!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1810045434">Sometimes, kids that age, get what we call rock<br/>
boogers--the really hard ones, that makes their noses<br/>
sound stuffed up.  Sometimes, they need to just get in<br/>
there and dig it out, so they can breathe again.  My<br/>
daughter used to do this when she was around that age.<br/>
 I tried wiping her nose, and telling her to blow, but<br/>
it didn&#39;t work.  One day, my mom said no wonder she&#39;s<br/>
always picking her nose, she has a rock in there.  She<br/>
never did unspeakable things with them, (whatever<br/>
those may be), but sometimes it&#39;s the only way they<br/>
can clear out their nose.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure if this helps or not, but I just let her do<br/>
it, whether we were in public or not.  She needed to<br/>
breathe, and for her it was a necessary thing to do. <br/>
I honestly don&#39;t think at that age, they think they<br/>
are offending anyone, they are just doing their thing.<br/>

along the way - anywhere from &quot;Eeeeewwww!&quot; to &quot;okay we&#39;re going into <br/>
a restaurant, please remember not to pick your nose etc at the <br/>
table&quot;. Depends on personality and temperament. Its not really going <br/>
to harm a 2yo to experiment in this way, and its pretty normal <br/>
behavior!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, it grosses *me* out, too! But until a child has the <br/>
communication skills *and* empathy to understand why not, giving him <br/>
flak about it will only undermine his self-esteem: Mom thinks I&#39;m <br/>
gross. Oops. I&#39;d bring it up periodically with my kids, but not harp <br/>
on it - I can say now that Ray hasn&#39;t done this in Years, and while <br/>
Mo still does from time to time, she has a sense of when and where <br/>
its okay. <br/>
<br/>
Just wait &#39;til you get to do teenage boy laundry... it&#39;ll make you <br/>
nostalgic for booger eating ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-20048625">Until you can verbally communicate with him you can&#39;t do anything.  <br/>
And even so, when you can verbally communicate, he&#39;ll forget and so  <br/>
on. Try to understand him. What should he do?? I do it – everybody I  <br/>
know does it and in my family it&#39;s not a taboo, though we don&#39;t do it  <br/>
in public, obviously. It might be disgusting for some people, but  <br/>
then just turn around. You happen to live with an individual with an  <br/>
own personality and own rights and you can&#39;t make him do anything.  <br/>
But if you respect him now it is very likely that he&#39;ll respect your  <br/>
disgust when he comes to understand it. So just wait :-)<br/>
<br/>
BUT I&#39;ve still come up with an idea. Once a doctor told me, that if  <br/>
one drinks enough, no boogers can be produced. That boogers where  <br/>
just an effect of not drinking enough. The nose should be humid and  <br/>
not with &quot;rocks&quot;, as someone said here. So you could concentrate on  <br/>
just giving him enough drinks (but then again, if he doesn&#39;t like to  <br/>
drink I wouldn&#39;t force him, but maybe find out drinks he likes a lot.  <br/>
I&#39;m sure it would bother him if you were telling him every 5 minutes  <br/>
to drink - but he&#39;ll show you that :-) )<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1355289998">There is another concern with nose picking that I think parents <br/>
should be at least aware of. My son, who is now 11 years old has <br/>
always picked his nose. I never worried about it too much until a few <br/>
months ago when he came to me and told me that he has a hole in his <br/>
nose. We looked on the intenet and called a doctor. He has a <br/>
perforated septum. It is caused by excessive nose picking or cocaine <br/>
use. (I think we can rule out the cocaine use) It is a hole about the <br/>
size of an eraser on a pencil. He still picks his nose sometimes out <br/>
of habit but I make sure there are plenty of tissue boxes around and <br/>
remind him to blow instead of pick. <br/>

remember reading, however, that kids who pick-n-chew  :o/  have fewer colds<br/>
