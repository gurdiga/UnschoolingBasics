<div id="ygrps-yiv-1478187929">New Amy here again...thanking everyone for your responses to my initial <br/>
newbie questions...this blog comment leads me to another question <br/>
regarding food and lack of exercise because of excess tv viewing...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve spent a lot of time researching the latest with nutrition and we&#39;ve <br/>
turned our lives around by eating natural and organic foods - nothing <br/>
processed- unless grandparents or us treat them with something <br/>
occasionally.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be able to let my children, young as <br/>
they are with maturing brains and bodies, buy and eat whatever they <br/>
want.  I do let them get things they like from the natural food store <br/>
but when we&#39;re in the regular grocery store I turn down suggestions to <br/>
buy pop tarts, for example, and cereal they see advertised on tv.  <br/>
Special occasions like our recent camping trip do we splurge and eat <br/>
some less nutritious foods, but at home we have a pantry and <br/>
freezer/fridge full of fruits and veggies (that they love eating anyway) <br/>
and snacks without trans fat and artificial preservatives and colors.  <br/>
We also limit fast food because we eat only natural/organic meats but we <br/>
do visit Micky Dees from time to time so I don&#39;t think they would ever <br/>
be likely to binge when they are older and on their own more.<br/>
<br/>
As far as tv goes, how do you not end up with overweight couch <br/>
potatoes?  Luckily I don&#39;t think I have to worry about that as my <br/>
children have remained pretty active, even when we dropped our &quot;school <br/>
at home&quot;, at least for the time being.  Granted it&#39;s been in the 100&#39;s <br/>
this past week so we&#39;ve all been vegging inside but we are nature lovers <br/>
so that&#39;s in our favor...but I know this is a question people ask a lot <br/>
regarding unschooling picturing kids sitting in front of the tv and <br/>
chowing down on chips and candy bars all day.<br/>
Thanks again<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-160091843">What post were they responding to?<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, herein lies the issue of making your lives full of joy and<br/>
adventure!  And the fact that this person is only seeing the world<br/>
through their paradigm... it is possible to shift those glasses to see<br/>
a different view of the world.  The poster most likely is comparing<br/>
unschooled kids (who have tons of freedom) to those kids who&#39;s lives<br/>
are repressed by outside influences (i.e. school, parents, etc...).<br/>
<br/>
And yes, there are things in the world that can affect us... so, then<br/>
you as parents, facilitators, guides to the world need to talk to your<br/>
kids about these things.  And if you&#39;re consumed by these things then<br/>
you need to STOP FIRST!  It&#39;s like telling your kids not to smoke and<br/>
then going and lighting up... it&#39;s just stupid.  Walk the walk...<br/>
don&#39;t just talk the talk!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1423282661">Wow, what an interesting thought. You know, it&#39;s exactly the  <br/>
opposite, our bodies *are* wired for processed foods and TV. IF  <br/>
you&#39;re an evolutionist, you know that 10,000 years ago people were  <br/>
walking around trying desperately to look for food, foods high in  <br/>
carbs were desirable because they were easy to process and had lots  <br/>
of calories for very little work. TV appeals to the part of our brain  <br/>
that needs to track multiple things. It appeals to the part of our  <br/>
brain that wants to learn by example. It appeals to our need for  <br/>
socialization, in a world that is too crowded and too loud, it does  <br/>
it in a way that doesn&#39;t force us to give more than we&#39;re able.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all about hardwiring...heehee.<br/>
<br/>
But completely off the whole post, sidetracked and off topic. That&#39;s  <br/>
kind of how my day is going anyway....<br/>
I think that the reason unschoolers can say, this is how our kids  <br/>
are, is because we see it every day. Then someone comes in and says,  <br/>
&quot;But I don&#39;t see that&quot;, trying to disprove our practice with an  <br/>
example that does not fit the situation. For radical unschoolers have  <br/>
no limits on TV. For someone who is harassing their children about  <br/>
TV, they have no means of proving that their kids would not watch TV  <br/>
because there has never been a control study done ;-)  Even more so,  <br/>
we see the value implicit in a) the TV that our kids watch and b) in  <br/>
the choice that the kids have to watch or not watch. Even someone who  <br/>
&#39;allows&#39; their kids to watch TV but does not see the value in it,  <br/>
will hold negative connotations in their hearts about it.<br/>
<br/>
And I don&#39;t know if that explains it all, but I&#39;ve got one girl who  <br/>
wants her head shaved, one baby who wants rocked to sleep, and one  <br/>
boy he wants a chapter read from goosebumps, four kids playing mario  <br/>
party and needing snacks, one autistic kid who&#39;s freaking out over  <br/>
the neighbors&#39; dog barking, and one toddler who probably needs  <br/>
reminded that their bladder is full. :-) fun every minute!<br/>

LOL!!  Oh and it isn&#39;t the dog barking but the lawnmowers buzzing behind<br/>
us.  Drives Keon crazy!<br/>
<br/>
Ren, I agree with what Melissa said about how people who don&#39;t RU who<br/>
haven&#39;t truly allowed their children these freedoms CAN&#39;T see how living a<br/>
RU life would work.  I used to be that parent.  I couldn&#39;t imagine that my<br/>
kids would ever get to the point where they weren&#39;t junkfood face stuffing<br/>
television zombies.  Now that I&#39;ve &quot;come to the other side&quot;  LOL! I CAN see<br/>
how some days there is just a need to be a junkfood face stuffing television<br/>
zombie,  And some days there is a need for peaches and sunshine (literally)<br/>
and other days for books and soda crackers.  And still other days when<br/>
peaches and television are a good thing.  But it took trusting my kids with<br/>
their own freedom and stepping back and observing even minute things and<br/>
being able to appreciate all the things my kids did as being valid before I<br/>
could release that fear that my children were going to grow up into mindless<br/>
zombies that weighed 800 lbs and needed a crane to remove them from their<br/>
houses as they clutched their last box of Ho-Ho&#39;s to their dying chests.<br/>
:-)  It&#39;s that &quot;inside perspective.&quot;  We dont&#39; have scientific studies to<br/>
prove it.  In fact I don&#39;t know that we could have a scientific study to<br/>
prove it.  How would one possibly create such a study.  We can look at<br/>
models though.  The model of coercive limiting parenting vs. mindful free<br/>
parenting.<br/>

Anytime I hear that nagging voice inside me saying the<br/>

something that we could do together. Sometimes they<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1840119398">It is funny that this is always the subject that comes up, <br/>
especially with newbies.  The reason that I find it so amusing is <br/>
that a parent gives their child complete freedom, from having very <br/>
little freedom, and then wonders why their child will only watch <br/>
TV.  Usually those comments are made within a couple weeks of <br/>
allowing that freedom and it takes MUCH longer than that for kids to <br/>
learn how to regulate themselves and start listening to their <br/>
bodies.  <br/>
<br/>
The other thing that always comes to mind when I read comments like <br/>
that is &quot;What are you offering them that is so much more exciting <br/>
than watching TV?&quot;  When my kids watch a lot of TV it is usually <br/>
because I am being lazy and not doing anything with them or not <br/>
offering them a choice that seems better to them.  The more <br/>
interesting my life is and the more options I give them the less the <br/>
TV is on.  When my kids say &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot;  what they are really saying <br/>
is &quot;Mom, I either want you to do something with me or help me find <br/>
something interesting to do.&quot;  I have learned to cue into that now <br/>
but I used to let it go and guess what?  They would turn the TV on <br/>
and watch it all day long!!<br/>
<br/>
We definitely go through spurts of lots of TV viewing but for the <br/>
most part our lives are too interesting to sit in front of the TV <br/>
all day.  The other side is that what is so bad about TV?  My kids <br/>
have learned a TON watching TV and it is always funny to have family <br/>
members that are very critical of TV be amazed at some of the things <br/>
my kids know and ask them where the heck they learned <br/>
that...........................&quot;TV!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I do know though that in our family it took about two years after <br/>
letting go of trying to control everything for us to live an <br/>
interesting, full life like the unschoolers lives that I read <br/>
about.  We were raised in a very strict, fundamentalist, legalistic, <br/>
cult-like religion.  We didn&#39;t have TV in our home, we couldn&#39;t wear <br/>
pants, cut our hair, etc,  Our entire life was controlled by someone <br/>
else.  My husband and I only left that religion four years ago and <br/>
even though we were technically unschoolers we certainly weren&#39;t <br/>
RU&#39;s and I still tried to control my children&#39;s lives.  Thank <br/>
goodness for my sis, Ren, who really helped me see life from a <br/>
different perspective and taught me how to start seeing things out-<br/>
of-the-box!!! Now I question everything and everybody!!  Very nicely <br/>
of course!!  But I am unwilling to take people&#39;s word for everything <br/>
now.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Depends. Some do and some don&#39;t.  Some see those cereals, cookies, fast food<br/>
as the &quot;holy forbidden&quot; and when they have sudden freedom (such as going to<br/>
college or moving out on their own) they will binge on those things that<br/>
were coveted when they were kids.  They are not learning to trust their<br/>
bodies when mom controls all their food.  so when on their own they may tend<br/>
to go overzealous with their eating because they haven&#39;t learned that eating<br/>
3 meals a day for a month At McD&#39;s will make you feel bloated, overweight,<br/>
listliss, and gross (not that I am advocating this diet - our family gags<br/>
whenever we pass most fast food places and we ate at them often).  In the<br/>
beginning when you start releashing control and giving over to freedom you<br/>
will see what looks like a lot of unhealthy eating.  they have to work it<br/>
out of their systems.  they have to know that you are going to trust them<br/>
and that as soon as that box of Fruit Loops is gone it isn&#39;t gone forever.<br/>
My oldest daughter has a sensitivity to Red Dye #40.  I gave over the<br/>
control of that to her years ago.  We both fully acknowledge that when she<br/>
consumes RD40 that she acts differently.  But it is her choice.  For a while<br/>
she went hog wild, eating all the formerly colored foods that were<br/>
forbidden.  After a while she realized that she didn&#39;t like the way that she<br/>
felt when she ate certain foods and decided to eat alternatives instead.<br/>
Sometimes she still has food containing RD40, but it always reminds her why<br/>
she abstains from it.  Not because I told her that she shouldn&#39;t eat it, but<br/>
because she knows how she feels, how her body reacts, when she does eat it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As far as tv goes, how do you not end up with overweight couch<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; potatoes?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As with food at the beginning it is going to look like your kids are turning<br/>
into brainless zombies.  First you have to find the value in television.<br/>
You have to see their viewing television as part of their joyful lives and<br/>
that there is merit in television.  Second YOU watch with them.  Learn their<br/>
lives.  Understand their shows (or in my case try to understand their video<br/>
games - which I am dreadfully inept at) Third, you strew (do a search<br/>
through the archives for strewing) and make opportunities to expand their<br/>
world.  Sometimes that strewing is other television shows.  Sometimes the<br/>
strewing is a museum or park or activity.  Sometimes it is more of what they<br/>
are doing.  Our children&#39;s lives are full of interesting things and given<br/>
the opportunity they will pursue those things.  Read through some of the<br/>
pages at Sandra Dodd&#39;s website <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sandradodd.com">http://www.sandradodd.com</a> She&#39;s got quite a<br/>
few posts in there about how our mindless zombies, uh, I mean kids are<br/>
thriving even with television.  :-)<br/>

<br/>
  Those schooled kids wake up EARLY and eat a PopTart while they ride <br/>
the bus to school where they sit in a chair all day until they&#39;re <br/>
allowed (whether they are hungry or not) to go wolf down a corn dog and <br/>
fries with jello or pudding and a milk. Then they go BACK to their <br/>
chairs and sit for another few hours. After the last school bell rings, <br/>
they ride a bus home and then sit on another chair or lie on their beds <br/>
and do homework while munching on some chips and a coke. Then they eat <br/>
supper (fast food or a meal hastily prepared by mom---mac & cheese or <br/>
Hamburger Helper?) before watching the two hours of TV/video gaming <br/>
that they are allowed before they go back to their rooms to sit in a <br/>
chair while on the computer. Then they stay up as long as they possibly <br/>
can before they have to get up EARLY and eat a PopTart while they ride <br/>
the bus to school where they sit in a chair all day until they&#39;re <br/>
allowed to go.........<br/>
<br/>
 Right.<br/>
<br/>
  The *school system* is creating couch potatoes. Unschoolers DO things. <br/>
They visit friends. They go to the store. They visit museums and zoos <br/>
and parks. They spend hours playing instruments or with the dog. They <br/>
get enough sleep. They eat GOOD food, when they are hungry. They can <br/>
swim or run or bounce or swing whenever they want to. They work *with* <br/>
their bodies. They can learn how their bodies feel with a lack of <br/>
sleep, with enough sleep. They can learn which foods work best for <br/>
them, how much exercise they need/want to feel good. They watch tv <br/>
because they *want* to, not because they have no other options.<br/>
<br/>
 Unschooling does NOT produce couch potatoes. School does.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-49857774">On the first count, I wouldn&#39;t bet on it. My mom never let us have  <br/>
any kind of junk food, fast food or snacks. I&#39;m about 60 pounds  <br/>
overweight, still trying to recover from the urges I have to binge.  <br/>
I&#39;m also terrible at sharing, because in my subconscious, I never  <br/>
know when I&#39;ll be allowed more. It&#39;s only taken me 16 years to get to  <br/>
where I can hear it.<br/>
<br/>
On TV. Kids&#39; aren&#39;t designed to be overweight couch potatoes. the  <br/>
freedom to watch TV doesn&#39;t create them...the restrictions that force  <br/>
them to gain every second they can because they don&#39;t trust the  <br/>
adults in their lives NOT to take it away is what creates couch  <br/>
potatoes. If a child is only allowed to watch TV for one hour, they  <br/>
will sit for every second they have. If a child feels judged while  <br/>
watching, he may turn it off and the parent thinks they&#39;ve won, until  <br/>
they find ten years later that the child either doesn&#39;t trust the  <br/>
parent or the child watches mindlessly because they&#39;ve never KNOWN  <br/>
they can watch TV for pleasure or that they can even learn something.  <br/>
Children who know that they can turn the TV on any time they wish are  <br/>
free to turn it off whenever they wish, because they can trust that  <br/>
they can use it later. Ironically, once my children had that freedom  <br/>
to watch, they spent a lot less time watching.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to try to generalize kids who watch TV and  <br/>
eat sugar as doing it all the time, and it&#39;s certainly not as likely  <br/>
as one think to create overweight couch potatoes. I don&#39;t even know  <br/>
of any unschoolers who do that consistently. It may look like it, but  <br/>
their time is broken up into segments of interest.  Kids who grow up  <br/>
restricted either break out of the mold (&quot;Wow...now that I&#39;m out of  <br/>
the house, I&#39;ll be hiking when I feel like it&quot; and it won&#39;t happen  <br/>
again, or &quot;I&#39;m never doing that again&quot;) Of course, now I&#39;m  <br/>
generalizing, but from reading on all the unschooling stuff, it is  <br/>
far more likely for a restricted child to do that than an  <br/>
unrestricted child to overindulge. It&#39;s worth it to plan about eight  <br/>
months to let the kids sit in front of the TV to know that they are  <br/>
learning about their true interests, not one that may have been  <br/>
artificially created through restrictions.<br/>
<br/>
One more comment, the original post has a lot of &quot;we&quot; being used...do  <br/>
you mean you and your husband chose those things, or that your kids  <br/>
did too? I only say that because I noticed that it was mentioned that  <br/>
they requested poptarts and were denied. Is it ever possible to even  <br/>
just say, &quot;Well, sure, why not?&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I used to think that if I kept the things I had a weakness for around  <br/>
I would just scarf them down. One year I bought 3 bags of candy for  <br/>
Halloween and polished them all off in a couple of days. :-P I  <br/>
learned to wait until the day before Halloween to buy it. When I went  <br/>
to visit my father who kept bags of candy around I spent the week  <br/>
visiting the bags several times a day.<br/>
<br/>
But on a list several years ago someone mentioned something about  <br/>
&quot;giving yourself permission&quot; to eat the things you were limiting for  <br/>
yourself and you&#39;d find you wouldn&#39;t pig out all the time. I said,  <br/>
yeah, sure. ;-) All the evidence points to &quot;No way!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Eventually when my daughter was old enough and she was bringing candy  <br/>
into the house and I kept asking her permission to have some ;-) I  <br/>
decided to try to what was suggested. And, though it took 3 bags of   <br/>
almond M&Ms to gain my body&#39;s trust that almond M&Ms were not going  <br/>
to disappear off the face of the earth and I could have as much as I  <br/>
wanted anytime I wanted, I did get to the point where I can walk by  <br/>
chocolate without thinking about it.<br/>
<br/>
Right at the moment there are Dove milk chocolate miniatures, Lindt  <br/>
chocolate balls with the melt in your mouth centers, and Ghirardelli  <br/>
chocolate bits in the house all easily accessible. I think I had a  <br/>
Dove a couple of days ago. Maybe.<br/>
<br/>
There are chips that come with sandwiches piling up on top of the  <br/>
refrigerator that no one&#39;s touching.<br/>
<br/>
There are Pop-Tarts in the cupboard that my husband finds convenient  <br/>
for lunchbags when there isn&#39;t something better.<br/>
<br/>
I *couldn&#39;t* have done that when I treated chocolate as a special  <br/>
food to be eaten only on rare occasions. Now it&#39;s just there and I  <br/>
don&#39;t have it far more often than I do. I *thought* I knew what I  <br/>
would do with unlimited access but I had never given myself unlimited  <br/>
access. I had only given myself a small window of opportunity to glut  <br/>
before it all disappeared again. Now I do have unlimited access and I  <br/>
don&#39;t eat an excessive amount.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Why are you imposing a solution to a problem that may not even exist?  <br/>
Why are you assuming your children would be exactly like you?<br/>
<br/>
How is that different than buying Barbies for a dinosaur loving  <br/>
child? It&#39;s not looking at who the child is and responding to their  <br/>
unique needs but treating them as a generic entity.<br/>

Chocoholic here. But I have two HUGE bowls of M&Ms in my foyer. I kep <br/>
them FULL all the time. I just found dark chocolate M&Ms for one bowl. <br/>
I hardly ever put my hand in that bowl. Hardly ever. Guests do. All the <br/>
time. Because they don&#39;t have M&Ms avaiable 24/7. But *I* can have them <br/>
anytime I want. I don&#39;t want them.<br/>
<br/>
I dare you to buy a CASE of PopTarts. Go to Sam&#39;s. Get TWO cases and <br/>
keep 3-4 boxes in the cupboard at all tines. I bet the first box will <br/>
be gone in a few hours. But I&#39;m willing to bet $25 you won&#39;t finish <br/>
that 2nd case without help.<br/>
<br/>
Same with the Pringles. The reason you *crave* Prngles is because they <br/>
were &quot;sacred&quot; and &quot;special&quot; and only doled out sparingly. Buy two cases <br/>
and have ALL you want any time you want. They&#39;ll lose that appeal.<br/>
<br/>
It works with PopTarts and Pringles! Ice cream and M&Ms! Champagne and <br/>
doughnuts!  I promise.<br/>

me, he picks certain &#39;easy&#39; stretches we&#39;ve determined I can handle <br/>
and we only play for maybe 20 minutes (one round or whatever). OR <br/>
he&#39;ll pick a simpler thing like the videogame versions of trivial <br/>

festive occasions called for BIG portions with all the trimmings. In <br/>
college, I would type term papers for friends for the price of a pint <br/>
of ice cream (regular store bought for end notes, hand packed Carvel <br/>
if I had to fight with footnotes in the days before word processing) <br/>
and then proceed to eat the whole thing for dinner (or breakfast or <br/>
lunch). DH&#39;s family had/has all sorts of food issues. When we got <br/>
married, a half gallon of ice cream -might- last a week, probably <br/>
less, rarely more. Then we had DS and chose not to limit his eating <br/>
right from the start - the idea that he could nurse at will, start <br/>
when he was hungry and stop when he was full, started to seep in to <br/>
the rest of our thinking (that and reading message boards a bunch). We <br/>
have -learned- from DS to consider what we -want- to eat and how much, <br/>
rather than just randomly browsing the kitchen eating everything until <br/>
we can&#39;t manage it anymore. We&#39;re just as likely now to say No thanks <br/>
if offered ice cream if that&#39;s not what we want. We&#39;ve even had <br/>
favorite premium ice creams go to ice crystals because they didn&#39;t get <br/>
eaten for weeks and weeks. It&#39;s still something we struggle with - <br/>
years and years of habits and thought patterns don&#39;t go away in a day -<br/>
 but we&#39;re learning. And, DS? He LOVES some things like Lindt white <br/>
chocolate bars...but at the same time, he&#39;ll eat maybe half a bar over <br/>
the course of 2 or 3 days and then it just sits there for a bit and <br/>
maybe gets nibbled a little more and then just sits. It has no &#39;hold&#39; <br/>
on him - he is in charge of it, not vice versa. Not only that, but he <br/>
takes joy in it - it isn&#39;t all a blur of &quot;gotta have some&quot; but <br/>
rather &quot;I am enjoying this bite of chocolate&quot;, savoring it but not in <br/>
the &#39;make it last as long as possible, there ain&#39;t no more&#39; way but <br/>
rather &#39;this is something I am really enjoying right this moment&#39;.<br/>

they hit the market. A friend&#39;s sibling worked at M&M Mars in NJ, <br/>
where I grew up, and they gave big bags of them to the employees as <br/>
sort of a &#39;test marketing&#39; thing. Also, the almond M&Ms that are now <br/>

have made to give as holiday gifts.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1170063825">The one food I wanted as a child that we didn&#39;t get was sugared cereal.  My<br/>
cousins had it and we camped together and sometimes they&#39;d offer it to us<br/>
but my mom didn&#39;t want us (6 of us) eating all their food and so we weren&#39;t<br/>
allowed.  It was expensive when we were little.  It isn&#39;t any more, at least<br/>
not on sale and store brands.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When my girls were little we didn&#39;t offer them sugared cereal or pop tarts<br/>
but eventually they had it at other people&#39;s houses and wanted it.  When we<br/>
began buying those items I did not limit it for them.  As much as it made me<br/>
cringe sometimes, I allowed them to have all they wanted, which was usually<br/>
only a bowl a day or one or two poptarts a day.  It got old fast.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My older dd sometimes still eats a bowl of sugared cereal for breakfast but<br/>
her foods of choice are fruit and veggies so I don&#39;t worry about her diet<br/>
and more often than not she&#39;s the one eating rice crispies or some other<br/>
lower sugared cereal.  My younger dd, whose food of choice is chocolate<br/>
doesn&#39;t eat sugared cereal at all.  She doesn&#39;t like it and says it&#39;s too<br/>
sweet.  She is having strawberries and watermelon for breakfast today.  More<br/>
often she has left over supper for breakfast like rice and corn.  We still<br/>
buy a LOT of sugared cereal however.  Guess who eats it?  Dh and I do.  I&#39;ve<br/>
finally allowed myself to eat it without guilt and overall my diet is good<br/>
and I am very healthy.  I am at a fairly healthy weight and I exercise<br/>
almost every day.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Eating foods peacefully and happily is more important to me than the<br/>
nutritional content of a particular food.  Stressing over what you allow<br/>
yourself to eat or not eat will probably kill you faster than eating less<br/>
nutritional foods.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-488821958">&quot;We do plenty of that...but I know that if we buy pop tarts, for<br/>
example, on a regular basis, I myself would be eating them every<br/>
morning as well and that would not be a healthy diet for me so how<br/>
could I allow my kids to eat that way?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard of a family that ate ONLY organic, only used organic<br/>
products (household cleansers, soaps etc..), was very, very strict<br/>
about diet and what they came in contact with, yet one of the children<br/>
ended up with cancer.<br/>
<br/>
My Grandparents ate beef their entire lives (farmers), and eat all<br/>
sorts of foods that make me cringe, yet they&#39;re in their 90&#39;s and<br/>
doing pretty well (still gardening, tinkering, living on their own).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think there are any guarantees about lifestyle and diet. I<br/>
think we all have to find what works best for our own bodies and not<br/>
worry so much. I am personally horrified by some of the additives,<br/>
preservatives and dye in certain foods....yet I don&#39;t think focusing<br/>
on what is wrong with food will help us either. I think trying to<br/>
bring in lotsa good, yummy, healthy food is better than trying to keep<br/>
certain foods out.<br/>
<br/>
I used to work in a health club and counsel people on lifestyle<br/>
changes. One of my biggest pieces of advice for those trying to lose<br/>
weight, was to NOT limit themselves, but to try and focus on ADDING<br/>
certain things to their diet. ADD more water drinking, ADD more fruits<br/>
and veggies, the thought process of adding to diet is much more<br/>
fulfilling and works better in the long run than trying to keep food<br/>
OUT....feeling limited usually backfires.<br/>
<br/>
I think pop-tarts are nasty little things.:)<br/>
BUT, I don&#39;t make a big deal when my kids want some and I CAN go buy a<br/>
healthier version if we need to have them around a lot. So far, my<br/>
kids don&#39;t have a desire to have them around all the time. <br/>
<br/>
I do a lot of self-talk in regards to food. I cringe at sugary cereal,<br/>
but really, it&#39;s no worse than eating a candy bar and that&#39;s something<br/>
we choose regularly. I think the best thing I can do for my children,<br/>
is look at their food choices as part of the learning experience and<br/>
trust that they will find a balance that is best for them eventually.<br/>
<br/>
My job is to provide lots of healthy, delicious foods, help them try<br/>
the things they want, provide them with information (when they&#39;re<br/>
ready for it) and not stress if they eat pop-tarts!!:)<br/>

+++Chocoholic here. But I have two HUGE bowls of M&Ms in my foyer.  I kep <br/>

I hardly ever put my hand in that bowl. Hardly ever. Guests do. All  the <br/>
time. Because they don&#39;t have M&Ms avaiable 24/7. But *I* can have  them <br/>
anytime I want. I don&#39;t want them.+++<br/>
 <br/>
We have chocolate and cookies and chips around all the time and often they  <br/>
will get stale before we eat them.  This summer when my stepkids were  visit<br/>
ing, (all public schooled and in a fairly rule oriented family during the  school <br/>
year) I bought bags of M&M&#39;s, Reeses Cups, and other snacks I knew  they <br/>
liked.  I kept a giant bowl filled with the M &M&#39;s on the cofffee  table.  My 13 <br/>
year old stepdaughter ate 8 of the large Reeses Cups the  first night she was <br/>
here.  My 17 year old stepson hid a bag of the M &  M&#39;s behind the <br/>
entertainment center so the other kids wouldn&#39;t eat them.   They were here about a month <br/>
and I just kept filling that bowl.  It took  about 2 weeks before they realized <br/>
that the candy was going to continue to be  available anytime they wanted it.<br/>
 <br/>
The difference with this situation and unschoolers is that next  summer, we <br/>
will go through it all again...with the food, the sleep, the  TV.  They have <br/>
lived their school year with arbitrary limits and rules  and just haven&#39;t had <br/>
any experience listening to their bodies.<br/>
 <br/>
Our unschooled kids have learned to make choices about eating, sleeping, TV  <br/>
watching, etc. for years and with our trust in them, they have learned to  <br/>
trust themselves.  I know Kelly says this often but I just have to  echo...&quot;It&#39;s <br/>
all about the trust.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1198187021">By the way, since poptarts seem to be a big theme here, you might <br/>
check out Food Network&#39;s website - Alton Brown did a show a while back <br/>
where he made an equivalent product to pop tarts - but he made them <br/>
himself so he could choose whatever to put in them (his own homemade <br/>
jam for instance). I think he made them with sliced apple but noted on <br/>
the program that you could put any kind of filling in them you want.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, if there&#39;s something that you just can&#39;t abide, odds are <br/>
you can find something similar enough to fill that niche - like <br/>
getting SunDrops instead of M&Ms.<br/>

we all like it. The best thing is that we can then &quot;dress&quot; it as we <br/>
choose instead of buying a bunch of different cereals. It&#39;s mildly <br/>
sweet to start with - sweet enough for DS usually. I generally put a <br/>
small scattering of pecans and a sparse handful of chocolate chips <br/>
on mine (yes, I eat chocolate chips on my organic healthy cereal). <br/>
DH puts nuts and banana and raisins on his. DS will sometimes add a <br/>
bit of additional honey but his favorite thing is to put some <br/>
raisins in a ziplock bag, add about half a teaspoon of sugar, zip it <br/>
and shake it to coat the raisins, then put the raisins on the <br/>
cereal - like the commercial raisin bran type cereals but way less <br/>
sugar (and other stuff) over all. We&#39;ve gone through almost 3 boxes <br/>
of this stuff in the last week and a half - it was dinner last night <br/>
because anything else required too much heat or time in the hot <br/>
kitchen - cereal was fast and cool.<br/>

times and I - well, I just really really love them.<br/>
<br/>
I now buy them at Costco in a huge container.<br/>
<br/>
The first time I bought that huge container, I ate them until I felt  <br/>
ill. I even ate the flavors i don&#39;t like that much. But I bought  <br/>
another container, anyway, and left it sitting out. After that, I  <br/>
occasionally ate too many and was annoyed with myself - never ate so  <br/>
many as to make myself actually feel sick, but I would just feel like  <br/>
I&#39;d over-indulged in sweet stuff. AND I&#39;d feel icky and guilty and  <br/>
ashamed of myself. But I kept reminding myself that it was okay - I  <br/>
actually heard myself say, to myself, &quot;Pam - you&#39;re a grown-up and if  <br/>
you want to eat jelly-bellies it is YOUR decision.&quot; I figured that  <br/>
&quot;you&#39;re a grown-up&quot; phrase, coming to mind, was a key indication that  <br/>
my &quot;issues&quot; were based on having been restricted by adults when I was  <br/>
a kid. I definitely remember that we had very healthy foods when we  <br/>
were kids - no sodas, no store-bought cookies - dessert was pre- <br/>
prepared and served right after dinner. A little tiny dish of  <br/>
homemade pudding was common. Ice cream on a special occasion. Cake  <br/>
was for birthdays. It wasn&#39;t that we were denied - I don&#39;t think we  <br/>
ASKED for other stuff - and my mom did the shopping every 2 weeks and  <br/>
we just ate what she bought. But I remember seeing sodas in my  <br/>
neighbor&#39;s refrigerator and being absolutely flabbergasted - I hadn&#39;t  <br/>
realized you could buy them and take them home - sodas were something  <br/>
we had when we were on vacation - my dad would buy them from vending  <br/>
machines when we were on the road.<br/>
<br/>
And now it has been months since I ate a bunch jelly bellies -  we  <br/>
have a huge container that has been sitting out on the table in front  <br/>
of me for the past month and I think there is another huge container  <br/>
under the front seats of my car &lt;G&gt;. I can&#39;t remember the last time I  <br/>
had ANY of the candies, but I had a peach and a banana in the last hour.<br/>
<br/>
It is kind of a scary thing to really test whether this will work -  <br/>
giving yourself a huge abundance of the things that have, in the  <br/>
past, felt like a weakness. But in a world of abundance, our minds  <br/>
seem to relax and start to think more clearly and we make more  <br/>
thoughtful choices.<br/>
<br/>
It is AMAZING how strong and how pervasive the impact of a sense of  <br/>
scarcity or limitation can be.<br/>

Years ago, when I spent my junior year (&#39;80-&#39;81) in Europe, I met this <br/>
adorable couple on the train from Berlin to Frankfurt. We sat and <br/>
chatted for hours. They told me about their lives in East Berlin. How <br/>
they could leave at 65, but that he&#39;d waited until his wife was 65 so <br/>
that they could both leave together. This was their exit train ride. <br/>
They&#39;d spent the last two months in West Berlin, living with her sister <br/>
and getting reacclimated to the West, but now they were travelling to <br/>
his childhood home town near Frankfurt.<br/>
<br/>
I asked what he liked *most* about the West.<br/>
<br/>
He said, &quot;Strawberries.&quot; She said, &quot;Pineapple.&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Scarcity and limitation at its extreme.<br/>
<br/>
I have a lovely photo of them in my scrapbook. They were darling.<br/>
