<div id="ygrps-yiv-1463412926">Hope this is ok to ask on here.<br/>
A friend and her kids want to do some stuff that makes things go bang, whoosh, makes them jump, makes a mess, is cheap and can involve plenty of colour and glitter but doesn&#39;t have to.<br/>
She has found and tried some experiments on pinterest but feels they were more damp squib than anything else and all effort over in a minute for not much excitement.<br/>
For example she did vinegar and bicarb in a self seal sandwich bag and the description said it would pop and fly in the air but all they got was a bit of a pop.<br/>
She really wants a bit more (safe) drama.<br/>
Has anyone got any tried and tested stuff that goes bang,makes you jump and creates a mess!!<br/>
her 4 kids range from 3 to 14.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
For the younger kids, play with water pressure - a hose with various attachments, water balloons, squirt guns. Play games like egg-toss using not only eggs but ripe fruit - and of course more water balloons.<br/>
<br/>
If they like big noises, get drums and cymbals. If you can find one, get a piano. Play with resonance and percussion. Smash things (safely!) by throwing or putting them in a bag and hitting them with a hammer. Get a cheap amp and play with amplified sound and (inevitably) feedback.<br/>
<br/>
Whoosh... you mean fly? Make paper airplanes and gliders. Look for kits and instructions to attach balloons. Get a remote control helicopter. Look into those flexible race-track kits for toy cars. <br/>
<br/>
For tweens, balsa wood cars and small rockets with NO2 cartridges might be fun, if they&#39;re into the process. Play with hot air - make hot air balloons with birthday candles and simple gizmos to twirl over a tea-candle. Play with fire (safely!) on a hearth or in a grill. Get some snap circuits and play with electricity. <br/>
<br/>
Fireworks - depending on where you are, those are a great source of bangs, flashes and whooshes.<br/>
<br/>
Poi and other fire toys are fun, and poi themselves are easy to use:<br/>

And there are LED toys to spin and juggle:<br/>

The bigger the reaction, the more energy is involved - so beyond simply foaming up, that means you&#39;re getting into heat, electricity, and serious chemical reactions. And an impressive reaction takes a lot more time to set up than the reaction itself. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-820989350">Mentos and diet coke! Brilliant. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKoB0MHVBvM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKoB0MHVBvM</a><br/>

We&#39;ve also done bicarb and vinegar and food colouring volcanoes. Milk and soap and food colouring is fun: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmxhH7QMnJ8&feature=related.">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmxhH7QMnJ8&feature=related.</a> This is cool: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrVuag3YCtQ&feature=fvwberel,">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrVuag3YCtQ&feature=fvwberel,</a> how to make a bouncy egg. I could keep linking stuff from youtube, but that&#39;s where I&#39;d go. Go to youtube, put in at home experiments for children and see what comes up. You can also look at krampf experiments, a lot seems to be pay for, but maybe there are still free things there? <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrVuag3YCtQ&feature=fvwberel.">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrVuag3YCtQ&feature=fvwberel.</a><br/>
