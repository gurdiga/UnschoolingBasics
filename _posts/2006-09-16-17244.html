<div id="ygrps-yiv-426400084">I just wanted to let everyone know that I cannot keep this project going!  I just don&#39;t have the time or energy to do it right now.  If someone has the interest to partner with the blog carnival, or start up a podcast, I really encourage you to do it!  I started this one because I was wishing there was one and there wasn&#39;t.  It&#39;s at least a couple hours per podcast to put together, but for someone that isn&#39;t working full time as I am, it would not be too much of a commitment.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a lot for the encouragement, and the positive comments from everyone who listened!  I hope that someone will take the idea and run with it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1054236345">was just about to e-mail you and see if you were okay. :-) I <br/>
understand how hectic life can be. <br/>
<br/>
If anyone wants to pick up the torch, that would be great. We&#39;re <br/>
already at the third edition of Unschooling Voices and the 4th will <br/>
be out on October 1st. If someone decided to do the podcast, let me <br/>
know. :-)<br/>
