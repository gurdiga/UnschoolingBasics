That&#39;s a great story.  I think you touched on something there that is a<br/>
major problem with teens and college age students.  They go hog-wild when<br/>
their parents aren&#39;t around to control them.  They&#39;ve never been taught<br/>
self-control because they&#39;ve always been exposed to a dictatorship at home.<br/>
 <br/>
That would make an awesome research project.  What is the correlation<br/>
between  teen and college age &quot;acting out&quot; and the discipline they grew up<br/>
exposed to?  I think I&#39;m going to start thinking about how this sort of<br/>
information can be studied.<br/>
<br/>
My parenting style has most certainly begun to change ever since bringing my<br/>
child home from public school.  Thanks so much for sharing that story. <br/>
There&#39;s so much great discussion and introspection going on in the group<br/>
right now.  It&#39;s really made me think about my own life and motives and the<br/>
way I&#39;d really like things to be in my household.<br/>

 <br/>
Last night, my 14 yo was talking online to a 15 yo friend in another  <br/>
state. He questions her, frequently, about her relationship with us  <br/>
(her parents) and he is very very sure of himself, sure of his  <br/>
opinions (at least comes across that way - the fact that he brings  <br/>
the topic up over and over makes me think that, inside, he isn&#39;t  <br/>
really as sure of himself as he appears). He is a &quot;good kid&quot; - he&#39;s  <br/>
polite, he&#39;s interesting, he talks to adults (although the kids say  <br/>
he acts &quot;different&quot; around adults), he seems to love his parents and  <br/>
his siblings, he has interests and passions, he seems to get along  <br/>
pretty well with other people, in general and seems overall really  <br/>
good-natured and easygoing.<br/>
<br/>
He is frequently &quot;grounded&quot; or has things &quot;taken away&quot; - by his  <br/>
father, primarily, for breaking family rules. He has been spanked,  <br/>
too, when younger. He STRONGLY favors the exact kind of upbringing he  <br/>
is experiencing. He tells Rosie that any child of his will most  <br/>
definitely be spanked and punished for disobeying rules and said that  <br/>
kids who aren&#39;t punished get spoiled and that he doesn&#39;t think  <br/>
children are parents are on the same &quot;level&quot; - that parents should  <br/>
act like parents and say &quot;no&quot; when they need to.  Rosie said to him,  <br/>
last night, &quot;So, do you think I&#39;m spoiled, because I&#39;ve never been  <br/>
punished and my parents don&#39;t really ever just say no?&quot; He didn&#39;t  <br/>
answer, really, but just came back with the question, &quot;If your  <br/>
parents ever just said &quot;no&quot; to something, would you listen?&quot; (She  <br/>
says he meant would she ignore them and do whatever it is anyway or  <br/>
would she abide by her parents&#39; wishes.) She told him, &quot;Yes, of  <br/>
course I would.&quot; His answer: &quot;Yeah, right.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She said, &quot;If they felt that strongly that they just straight out  <br/>
said, &quot;Absolutely not. No way. No discussion.&quot; then I&#39;d think there  <br/>
is some REALLY good reason and I&#39;d go along with their wishes. But  <br/>
they&#39;ve never done that, they always explain their reasons and we  <br/>
talk about things and decide together.&quot; He said, &quot;Kids don&#39;t know  <br/>
enough to decide everything for themselves.&quot; She said, &quot;I don&#39;t  <br/>
decide everything for myself. I decide WITH my parents.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This went on - and she got frustrated because it was clear that he  <br/>
simply couldn&#39;t CONCEIVE of the kind of relationship where kids and  <br/>
parents honestly try to work things out together. Here is this very  <br/>
nice kid with nice parents - but they see themselves as inevitably  <br/>
adversarial and, the part that saddens Rosie most, the teenager sees  <br/>
HIMSELF as needing external control through threat of punishment to  <br/>
keep himself from doing bad things. If his parents were not there to  <br/>
threaten punishment, he apparently thinks he would go wild and do all  <br/>
kinds of stuff that he shouldn&#39;t do.<br/>
<br/>
THAT is a foreign concept to Rosie.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-204915849">You know, Lesa, I&#39;ve been thinking about the teen  years and the relationship to parenting styles lately myself.   I&#39;ve known teens raised in controlling homes who got into partying and  drugs and sex as soon as they left home.  I&#39;ve also been a teen  who didn&#39;t have much for rules or punishments, and I went hog-wild just  as bad as they did, and at an earlier age.  The one thing I did  realize, though, was that my mom wasn&#39;t around and wasn&#39;t very involved  with my life in my teen years.  I was just kind of set free at 10  - left to make sure I got my homework done and make meals for myself  and two younger bros and cleaning the house and such.  My mom did  the best she could as a single mom, going to school full-time and  working as much as she could when she wasn&#39;t at school.  I&#39;m not  saying this to whine, but to make the point that I think it&#39;s the  amount of involvement, communication, and interest in teens&#39; lives,  along with giving them the freedom to do & choose for<br/>
 themselves,  that is the key to keeping kids out of trouble when they leave home or  are without parental supervision.  I could always be wrong or  playing the &quot;what if?&quot; game with my childhood, but this is the theory  floating in my head lately.<br/>
