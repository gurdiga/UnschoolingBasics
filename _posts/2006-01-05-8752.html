Subject: Am I an unschooler?<br/>
<br/>
This may seem like a stupid question, but honestly, I don&#39;t know what<br/>
to call us.<br/>
+++++++++++++++++++++<br/>
<br/>
I am always mindful of labeling.  My daughter and I Metamorphosis too much!<br/>
haha<br/>
<br/>
I have let her figure out what she is, not what we are.  Her and I are quite<br/>
different in our approaches.  I use lots of reference books, etc. I really<br/>
enjoy them.  She reads fiction.  So, it&#39;s really not us, it&#39;s her and then<br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
So, if someone is truly interested in what we are and is genuine in their<br/>
search, I&#39;ll say, &quot;I&#39;m a Whole Learner she is Life Learner, but you might<br/>
want to ask her directly.&quot;    If someone is being a pest and just asking so<br/>
they can debate how invalid our choices are, I&#39;ll throw out that we are both<br/>
RU&#39;s.  Just because adding that word Radical tends to scare people.  haha<br/>
<br/>
For some reason, out here in NM whenever I use the term unschooling people<br/>
say it is negative.  So, out here...I really try not to use it.  Hmmm, I<br/>
never had that problem in CA.<br/>
