<div id="ygrps-yiv-710272331">I think there&#39;s a time and place for doing acrobats and the household furniture isn&#39;t the right place.  Just because we&#39;re unschooling doesn&#39;t mean the children get to do whatever they want whenever they want without regard for anything else. <br/>
<br/>
It sounds like Parker wasn&#39;t harsh with Draven, and I think it&#39;s a perfectly valid request for everyone in the home to respect the property/furniture. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-306048023">Furniture can often feel like a big ticket item. It&#39;s probably better to respect your partner&#39;s wishes than to go head to head over something that she feels is worth saving. If, however, the couch does get damaged, there are ways to find cheap couches. We have a free one that someone up the road was off-loading, a local auction house often has couches go for fairly little money, Craig&#39;s list and charity shops (thrift stores) have relatively low cost furniture for sale or even for free. Garage sales or car boot sales can be great sources of cheap secondhand furniture. <br/>
<br/>
It helps, a lot, to have both parents on board for unschooling to work well. Not so much because consistency of vision is important from a child&#39;s perspective, but because one parent can feel very left out and estranged from their relationship with the other people in their family if they aren&#39;t really understanding the nature of the new approach. She spoke of wanting Draven to respect things, to work to keep them nice. She&#39;s looking out for him, she&#39;s wanting to help him become a sensible young man. This crazy unschooling thing could feel like a denial of all that she understands about parenting. Go slow and be patient. Help her keep the things she needs to be kept safe from this crazy new understanding of education and childhood safe. And print out things to put where she&#39;ll read them that seem helpful or things that will maybe help her to get on board, sandradodd.com is fantastic for that as is joyfullyrejoycing.com. <br/>
<br/>
Work to make this easy for her. And, if she never comes quite as far around as you hope she will, recognize that her relationship with Draven is her relationship with Draven and not about you. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You could choose to look at it like that, but an &quot;everything that  <br/>
belongs to the parents belongs to the kids&quot; idea is not an aspect of  <br/>
radical unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Do, yes, question your nos. See the goal as being your child&#39;s  <br/>
partner rather than every want being an instant yes. It might help to  <br/>
think of treating him as a guest rather than handing him a full  <br/>
partnership in the house. Even guests will run into times when the  <br/>
host will say &quot;Wait, let&#39;s do it this way instead.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If he were 5 and a high energy kid in an apartment where outdoor play  <br/>
and indoor trampolines couldn&#39;t meet all his needs and he really  <br/>
needed to bounce off the walls and the furniture, it would remove a  <br/>
*huge* source of tension in the home for the parents to see their  <br/>
child&#39;s need to expend energy as way more important than the  <br/>
furniture. (Some out of the conventional box solutions are: putting  <br/>
the good stuff in storage or in an out of the way room, getting used  <br/>
furniture, recognizing that under even normal wear and tear by the  <br/>
time the kids move out the furniture will be tired looking.)<br/>
<br/>
Finding ways to say yes is not the same as handing the furniture to  <br/>
the kids as though it were theirs. The amount of leeway may end up  <br/>
looking the same, but the parents are *choosing* to allow the kids  <br/>
greater latitude with the furniture than most parents would. That&#39;s  <br/>
not the same as anything goes.<br/>
<br/>
But the idea of &quot;everything that&#39;s mine is yours&quot; won&#39;t do you or him  <br/>
any favors! We all have personal boundaries. The more of those that  <br/>
are rethought, the fewer times you need to say no, the less tension  <br/>
in the atmosphere. But doing away with all personal boundaries will  <br/>
create a different type of tension born of self sacrifice.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of yes to everything he does and asks for, partner with him  <br/>
to find better (kinder, safer, less expensive, etc.) solutions to  <br/>
meet the underlying need. Finding solutions that work around  <br/>
limitations is a great skill for him to see you putting into action.  <br/>
But from what you relayed, it sounded like he was fine with not  <br/>
vaulting over the arm of the couch.<br/>
<br/>
If a parent shuts a door (eg, access to part of the world) and a  <br/>
child keeps opening it, it helps to rethink how important it is to  <br/>
keep that door closed or if there might be a different door that  <br/>
would meet the need just as well or find a way to make the original  <br/>
door useable. But if there are few shut doors and a kid is fine with  <br/>
the few that are shut it&#39;s not worth finding ways to open them,  <br/>
especially not starting an argument with a partner over it.<br/>
<br/>
If you would like her to try out this new way, you need to not make  <br/>
it unpleasant! You&#39;re upheaving her world. Try to be even sweeter and  <br/>
more thoughtful to her than you normally would to show your  <br/>
appreciation. Every time you think of forcing an issue, picture her  <br/>
dragging you -- with the hopes of convincing you to join -- to a  <br/>
church you never had an interest in exploring. That&#39;s probably what  <br/>
it&#39;s feeling like to her.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1899342060">I don&#39;t think that talking to your partner about the incident was wrong. I<br/>
am thinking that you seem to be pushing your agenda on her and she is<br/>
feeling uncomfortable. There are other ways that you may be able to help her<br/>
shift perspectives towards generosity and kindness and respect for your son<br/>
(though it doesn&#39;t sound like she is not these). Keep reading and finding<br/>
things that work for you. remember to treat her with respect, kindness and<br/>
generosity as well.<br/>
<br/>
To our family unschooling is a partnership with our children in a sense that<br/>
we work with them to get their needs met. In doing so we facilitate the<br/>
adults getting their needs met as well. You partner is concerned for the<br/>
couch. It sounds like she was respectful to Draven in asking him not to use<br/>
the couch as a playground. It seems like he was ok with that. Does he have<br/>
plenty of outlets for his energy? If not that perhaps reassessing that might<br/>
be in order.<br/>

It sounds like you are embracing unschooling to the detriment of your relationship with your partner. We have always more or less unschooled but I didn&#39;t do it deliberately until recently. When I found actual literature to back up what I thought, I went a little too far because I wanted everyone to have the same feelings and thoughts that I did. I didn&#39;t realize that I was contradicting myself by not meeting the other adults in my life where they were at that time. : -)<br/>

looking into it before judging it.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I find that I tend to be most judgmental when I am dragged into something kicking and screaming. Perhaps you can back off a little and give her more time. It is really hard for somebody to not only accept unschooling but completely embrace it in a short time. It has taken me an entire lifetime to get where I am now. Expecting your partner to slam on the breaks and veer off into the ditch might be hard for her. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Is it possible to radically unschool when only one parent agrees with it<br/>

parent only doing that some of the time), and how would you have handled the<br/>
couch incident?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it is possible but that makes more work for you because you have to accept everyone where they are at (even the adults). <br/>
<br/>
While I was transitioning to intentionally unschooling, I would have told my partner to lighten up and would have given him a lecture about respecting the kids, blah, blah, blah. Of course, that made him hate the idea of unschooling because he saw it as a &quot;me or them&quot; type of thing where he and the kids were pitted against each other. If I sent him information, it made it hard for him to read it with an open mind. I had inadvertently made things worse by trying to make things better.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, I would simply ask the kids to stop because it really bugs their dad. I try to make a conscious effort to respect my partner&#39;s differences. When I backed off and let him be himself, it was much easier for him to transition to intentionally unschooling. Something else that I will do is help my partner explain things to the kids. There have been times that he will automatically say no to the kids or will tell them not to do something and I will just say &quot;Why?&quot; It&#39;s funny because he will either tell us why the answer is no or he will say, &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; and then recant his no. Of course, I have to make sure that there is room for him to say, &quot;I don&#39;t know. I am just not comfortable with it.&quot; If that is the case, then I try to respect that and help communicate that to the kids. We all have boundaries and things that we are not comfortable with for various reasons. I try to help my kids understand my partner&#39;s perspective and try to help my kids understand their dad&#39;s perspective. It&#39;s not always easy though.<br/>

<br/>
We have a trampoline and swings, but neither are very much fun in the rain and we&#39;ve had an especially wet winter, here. Mo&#39;s been inside more than usual and needing to find more indoor ways to work off a little energy. So she&#39;s been doing a lot of acrobatic type things on the big bed - a futon, really, on top of another futon on a platform so its not as tall as a bed. Its been somewhat of a hassle, since this periodically sets the futon askew and it has to be wrestled back into place. It took me awhile to get in the habit of remembering to do that Before I was ready to go to sleep! Anyway, now that its warmed up and stopped raining so much, I&#39;ve asked her to please do her tricks on the trampoline, and I explained about the futon being a hassle. She&#39;s happy to use the trampoline for her fun, now that its not wet all the time. <br/>

This is So True, because it illustrates to the kiddies that You are tolerant, understanding and accepting of others&#39; differences.  Modelling respectful behaviour to others (especially those that we love!) is paramount.  I remember when I was young, I was well aware that my Dad showed a friendly side to friends/strangers, and the family got the complete opposite behind closed doors.  My Mum would say, &quot;you don&#39;t air your dirty clothes outside the family home for all to see.&quot;  It was a Horrible &#39;lesson&#39; to a child that only immediate family suffer shitty moods of parents/siblings; because they are family.  I didn&#39;t get it then, just as I don&#39;t get it now.  So - the ones that we love and care for receive the blows (moods) of our hard days, whilst strangers get a smile?   That was probably my initial drive to unschooling my kids.<br/>

Unfortunately, when I respond similarly, my partner sees my response(s) as undermining his &#39;authority&#39;.   He feels that I should back him up and stand by him regardless.  This, I struggle with.  This is where arguements occur in my home.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1487998497">Something important in all of this is to remember that, as we&#39;re moving<br/>
toward/learning to treat the kids with respect and partnership, we need<br/>
to also remember to treat our partner with respect and partnership.<br/>
Sometimes that gets lost &quot;because s/he&#39;s an adult, s/he should<br/>
understand this&quot;. The respectful partnership needs to apply globally,<br/>
not just with the kids.<br/>
<br/>
A current example at our house: DS is &quot;migratory&quot; in that he prefers to<br/>
sleep in his room during the winter but downstairs in the spring/summer.<br/>
However, he also has a tendency to flip his sleep schedule around. That<br/>
means he&#39;s asleep during the day. Sleeping in the living room during the<br/>
day puts a crimp on the things DH is comfortable doing (not wanting to<br/>
wake DS). I could just tell DH to suck it up for the next 4 to 6 months<br/>
until DS starts migrating back upstairs but that would not be meeting<br/>
DH&#39;s needs to be able to do the things he does during the day (grinding<br/>
wheat to make baked goods - I think today he&#39;s making bagels! - or<br/>
washing dishes, playing on the PS3 in the living room etc). I could just<br/>
tell DS that he has a bed and a bedroom (decorated to his<br/>
specifications) and that&#39;s all there is to it. That wouldn&#39;t be meeting<br/>
DS&#39; needs to feel comfortable and able to sleep AND do all the other<br/>
stuff he does when awake. We do (fortunately, I know not everyone has a<br/>
lot of options in this kind of situation) have a guest room adjacent to<br/>
the living room - it&#39;s already got a nice bed, we fixed it up so MIL can<br/>
spend the night on occasion if she chooses (long story). And, it&#39;s right<br/>
where the cable and the network router are so the Internet connection is<br/>
really good there (his bedroom is about as far from there as our house<br/>
allows). But, there&#39;s no TV (he often likes to use familiar DVDs to fall<br/>
asleep). So, I asked DS if he was okay with giving me some time to<br/>
ponder the situation - he was. I thought, discussed with DH (to figure<br/>
out logistical issues like setting up the cable TV), and last night we<br/>
sat down and drew up a plan of action - some stuff can happen within the<br/>
next week or so (like getting a wall mount for the TV and bringing his<br/>
TV downstairs), other stuff is going to take longer (clearing out some<br/>
of the stuff that&#39;s gotten stored in there). But, he can move down there<br/>
within the next week. DH gets the living room area free during the day,<br/>
DS gets to be downstairs, the guest room has a door that can be closed<br/>
for DS&#39; privacy and to minimize sound disturbances. It&#39;s not totally<br/>
perfect - we&#39;ve already mentioned to DS that on the odd occasion where<br/>
we have an overnight guest, we&#39;d prefer for him to use his upstairs room<br/>
and he&#39;s okay with that (it&#39;s maybe twice a year). Everyone felt heard<br/>
and respected BUT it wasn&#39;t an immediate Yes, right away, no problem. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it&#39;s okay and even necessary to say &quot;Can you give me a<br/>
minute/hour/day to think about that? I&#39;ve got some ideas that might work<br/>
but I need to figure out the best plan. I want to talk to &lt;partner&gt;<br/>
about it too to make sure I don&#39;t miss a good option.&quot; And make sure you<br/>
do touch base again in that time frame with options or a request for<br/>
more time &quot;hey, I am working on a plan but I need another day or two to<br/>
get some information. Let&#39;s plan to discuss this on Friday.&quot; Obviously,<br/>
in some circumstances the answer needs to be now (the ice cream truck is<br/>
outside and won&#39;t be there more than 10 minutes). Over time, however,<br/>
habits of thought will develop in all parties that will make quicker<br/>
answers possible - the knee jerk No will dissipate and the attitude of<br/>
&quot;how can we make this happen?&quot; will become the main operating idea. And,<br/>
all parties will build a reservoir of trust that mom/dad/partner/child<br/>
are trying to assist in reaching the goal rather than putting up road<br/>
blocks. That can take time if there&#39;s a history of No to be dealt with.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-412131005">This seems like a key bit to me. Learning not to be arbitrary.<br/>
<br/>
There are times when the answer is &quot;no&quot; but there should be a good reason. <br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s hard to see that we are being arbitrary sometimes. Pausing before answering helps, for me. My gut reaction might be &quot;NOOOOOOO&quot; but then I pause and think about why and sometimes the answer is still no, but a lot of times the answer is yes.<br/>

. . . Something else that I will do is help my partner<br/>
explain things to the kids. There have been times that he will automatically say<br/>
no to the kids or will tell them not to do something and I will just say &quot;Why?&quot;<br/>
It&#39;s funny because he will either tell us why the answer is no or he will say,<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; and then recant his no. Of course, I have to make sure that there<br/>
is room for him to say, &quot;I don&#39;t know. I am just not comfortable with it.&quot; If<br/>
that is the case, then I try to respect that and help communicate that to the<br/>
kids. We all have boundaries and things that we are not comfortable with for<br/>
various reasons. I try to help my kids understand my partner&#39;s perspective and<br/>
try to help my kids understand their dad&#39;s perspective. It&#39;s not always easy<br/>
though.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unfortunately, when I respond similarly, my partner sees my response(s) as undermining his &#39;authority&#39;. He feels that I should back him up and stand by him regardless. This, I struggle with. This is where arguements occur in my home.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I should have clarified that my ability to ask &quot;Why&quot; didn&#39;t come automatically. It was something that we transitioned to AFTER I regained my partner&#39;s trust. All of the times that I contradicted him in front of the kids eroded his self confidence and chipped away at his ability to be a parent. My partner felt like the little kid that had a teacher standing over his shoulder correcting every little mistake. I had to realize that my attempts to micro-manage my partner&#39;s interactions with the kids was undermining everything that is unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
My being able to ask &quot;Why&quot; was something that we worked up to after I spent time affirming that it was okay for him to have boundaries and it was okay for him to give guidance to our children. I had to back off. In all of our discussions about how to move away from arbitrary limits, I told him that I always ask myself why when I find myself saying no. He said he had a hard time doing that because &quot;NO&quot; is such a knee-jerk reaction for him. Having lived with his mother, I completely understand that. My openly asking him &quot;Why&quot; in front of the children was a result of the two of us problem solving together to find ways to meet everyone&#39;s needs. It started out as me asking why after the fact when we were alone. In front of the kids, I had his back so to speak. I had to learn to bite my tongue on a lot of things for a while in order to regain his trust and help him build up his own confidence. Yes, there were times that I completely disagreed with him but didn&#39;t say anything in the moment. As time went on and he was more comfortable in his role as a parent, he became more comfortable with discussing our different approaches to parenting. He saw first hand how the kids respond to him versus how they respond to me. He saw first hand that the kids prefer to come to me for everything. He asked why they preferred me over him. We had TONS of discussions. I tried to listen to him and try to support him just as I had been doing with the kids. My efforts to support him eventually transitioned to me being able to ask &quot;why&quot; in the moment with the children present. <br/>
<br/>
We have come a long way because now the kids are comfortable with asking my partner &quot;why&quot; and he is open to listening to them when they disagree with us. This stuff doesn&#39;t happen over night. It is all very gradual and it takes time. It takes deliberate effort on my part and it isn&#39;t always easy. Now, we have a house where everyone is free to ask &quot;why&quot;. I have been asked &quot;why&quot; my fair share of times. It has been great to help me be more deliberate and thoughtful. The other benefit is that I don&#39;t have to be the know it all and I don&#39;t have to give everybody else all the answers. I let everyone find their own comfort zone even if I don&#39;t always agree with it. <br/>

Before I came to unschooling I had this very bad habit of saying &quot;No&quot; first to anything that I wasn&#39;t sure about and *then* trying to make it a yes.  The initial &quot;no&quot; was coming from a desire to not get the hopes of the kids up in case I couldn&#39;t deliver on the yes.  Then I&#39;d think about it and change it to a yes if I could.  It really helped a great deal to change that habit to saying &quot;hmm, let me think about that for a minute.&quot;  Instead of an immediate and wishy washy &quot;no&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-953806791">Hi,<br/>
new to the concept of unschooling but seems have been raising my kids along similar principles through trial and error, I just didn&#39;t have a words for it.<br/>
I use the &#39;let me think about it a minute&#39; alot too, from when my kids started to talk I didn&#39;t want them to be one of those toddlers whose one of their first words is &#39;no&#39; and becomes one of the only ways they express themselves.<br/>
Even with little ones we discuss situations and I try to keep things positive rather than focus on negative aspects. so one of my favourites is &#39;in our family we like to.... look after each other etc. It also as a side issue has prepared them for the fact that other families and groups of people may operate differently. They actually are pretty grounded and cope very well in situations that are markedly different from ours, sometimes to my utter surprise and delight.<br/>
It all has taught them a really good respect for other people and they are quite fasinated with the difference. <br/>
will continue learning and reading, everyone&#39;s experiences are very helpful so thanks.<br/>
I did have one query, a couple of people have mentioned radical unschooling what is the difference with &#39;normal&#39; unschooling?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1080652431">&quot;I did have one query, a couple of people have mentioned radical <br/>
unschooling what is the difference with &#39;normal&#39; unschooling?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Normal unschooling is about not using school or a school system like a curriculum to educate your child[ren]. Radical unschooling is about extending the trust that you&#39;ve got about learning being a natural event in life, one that needs little sound and fury for it to occur, to the rest of life. So, for example, you believe that math is a tool that can be accessed through every day living and you apply that line of thought to the understanding that children can make decisions and learn about food preferences without needing parents to protect them from those choices. Or you recognize that reading is something that occurs with time and a life lived in a print-rich environment and you extend that recognition to understanding that knowing your own body and sleep needs can be done without parental pressure to go to bed at a specific time. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about trust, it&#39;s a trust in humans to be inquisitive and to be able to question and explore and learn without direction or limits but with help and engagement and support. Extending that trust beyond those things that fall under subjects in school is radical unschooling. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1132625045">I must admit I enjoyed the &quot;no&quot; period. Maybe it&#39;s hindsight glazing my memory with vaseline, but I loved them playing with their power. I loved the &quot;why&quot; stage as well. That part of their learning that they could continue a conversation by asking for an underlying understanding, even if they were only seeing how long I could come up with an answer. Both were a kind of game. An exploration of the rules of conversation and of their place in the world. I liked that. <br/>

As someone who lives a radical unschooling lifestyle with my kids, I&#39;d say radical unschooling is the normal kind ;) the rest is unschooling with &quot;exceptions&quot; as in &quot;we unschool except chores/math/food...&quot; but that&#39;s a Very biased opinion on my part. <br/>

I&#39;m way behind. :) This struck me because my 17yo son recently came home and gave me a hug for saying &quot;Maybe&quot; when he asked about the possibility of some plan or another coming together. He told me that he REALLY appreciates that when I say Maybe it means that I&#39;m not sure whether or not something can happen but that I&#39;m going to think about it/do what I can/try to figure it out. He&#39;d had several friends inform him that when their parents say &quot;maybe&quot; it&#39;s nearly always code for &quot;No, but I don&#39;t want to argue about it&quot;.  <br/>
