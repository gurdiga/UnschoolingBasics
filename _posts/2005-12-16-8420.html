<div id="ygrps-yiv-969779853">&quot;Sandra and Ren&#39;s session on Mindful Parenting was so great. It seemed <br/>
to have come at just the right time (driving home from a week visiting <br/>
my Mom) and I am really thankful for that one. Thank you , Ren, for <br/>
that. And Sandra, too, but I don&#39;t think she&#39;s on this list.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad it helped. It was a fun talk, but also kinda strange, seeing <br/>
my sister sitting in the front row crying every so often!!:)<br/>
<br/>
Sandra&#39;s not on this list, but I&#39;ll forward the post to her, I know <br/>
she&#39;ll appreciate the comments.<br/>
