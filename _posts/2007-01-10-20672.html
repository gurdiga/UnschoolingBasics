<div id="ygrps-yiv-1783004106">I&#39;m going to straight shoot here... but if it were me... I would let <br/>
her call it a damn penguin if she wanted to.<br/>
<br/>
I am all about letting kids pretend and explore.<br/>
<br/>
So in my way of thinking... who are you to tell her shes wrong? <br/>
Unless you have thoroughly examined that statue... it could be a <br/>
reindeer in a moose costume- and then she would be RIGHT!<br/>
<br/>
Okay, but all joking aside... I think at three years old (my dd is <br/>
three also) they are not in any hurry to know all the answers to <br/>
everything right now. If Kendall asks me &quot;what is that statue of&quot; I <br/>
would say &quot;its a moose&quot;. If she tells me its a reindeer... well then <br/>
it&#39;s a reindeer. If she asks me how to spell a word, then I will <br/>
tell her. If she tells me that it is spelled a certain way... then I <br/>
say- Go on Girl... you spell it however YOU can read it!!<br/>
<br/>
So anyway... if she says its a reindeer... then its a reindeer :)<br/>

a too serious aura around it so it seems even bigger.<br/>
<br/>
Kids are used to the world changing from what they think it is. It&#39;s  <br/>
a pretty much constant state of affairs for them!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d treat it a lot lighter. Rather than focusing on *her*, focus on  <br/>
the delight of exploring together. Rather than saying some form of  <br/>
&quot;Oh, no, sweetie, that&#39;s not a reindeer, that&#39;s a moose,&quot; say, &quot;Oh, I  <br/>
think it might be a moose!&quot; Because at anytime, at any point when you  <br/>
think you&#39;re absolutely right, you could be wrong! Share the delight  <br/>
of discovery together. :-)<br/>
<br/>
For the letters I would have said in a light tone of sharing my  <br/>
opinion, &quot;It looks like an &#39;O&#39; to me.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m enjoying this more and more with my youngest daughter (Joanna, 5)<br/>
<br/>
I miss the days where she would sing, &quot;You are my sunshine, my only<br/>
sunshine, you make me happy when skies are grapes&quot;.  I accidentally sang<br/>
&quot;grey&quot; along with her grapes and she asked me why, and I said, &quot;Oh<br/>
that&#39;s the way I am used to singing it, I guess&quot; and she started saying<br/>
grey too.<br/>
<br/>
Another favorite is, &quot;Eeny meeny miney mo, Ketchup tiger by the toe&quot;...<br/>
one day SHE said, &quot;Mom, it&#39;s not &#39;ketchup&#39;, its CATCH A&quot;  She no longer<br/>
says &quot;ketchup&quot; unless it&#39;s preceded by &quot;Please pass the&quot;.  Ahh growing up.<br/>
<br/>
Such a logical and literal child now too, but we always encourage her to<br/>
pretend... and if she really thinks one thing is another, I enjoy<br/>
letting her, as the older kids are too interested in &quot;teaching&quot; her what<br/>
it really is &lt;grin&gt;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; a moose&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are lots of ways to share information and discovery in between <br/>
those two extremes. Depending on the child, you might say &quot;does it <br/>
look like a reindeer to you? it looks like a moose, to me&quot;, or go a <br/>
different direction entirely and ask her some questions: how can she <br/>
tell it&#39;s a reindeer? or: does the statue make her think of Santa? <br/>
or: would you like to look at pictures of reindeer when we get home? <br/>
I don&#39;t mean ask her as though you were quizzing her, just friendly <br/>
chitchat. She might be happy to explore the subject further, or even <br/>
trying to initiate conversation.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to which she said as the excitement faded from her face &quot;mama <br/>
&gt; never says its a moose&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That, right there, makes me wonder if she would like more <br/>
information than what she&#39;s getting. Mo often makes statements <br/>
rather than asking questions, so I&#39;m used to offering a little bit <br/>
more information just to find out if she&#39;s &quot;fishing&quot; as it were. I <br/>
could also see a curious child wondering *why* momma never mentioned <br/>
something that daddy brings up. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to me that spark of happiness in <br/>
&gt; her is what matters most.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree! Sometimes giving a little &quot;more&quot; can help a kid fan those <br/>
sparks into passion. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be a little gentle with your dh, too, when you talk with him <br/>
about this subject. He may be thinking that &quot;dispensing accurate <br/>
information&quot; is part of his job as a dad, so framing his desire to <br/>
do that as &quot;correcting&quot; may come across as a slam against his <br/>
parenting. It might be better to talk about facilitating exploration <br/>
and discovery - focus on the positive, not the negative. From that <br/>
perspective, comments to your dd like &quot;do you think so? I think xyz&quot; <br/>
(assuming she&#39;s receptive to that) will provide some modelling for <br/>
dh of a different way to communicate, too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1412082630">Hey ya Kendrah<br/>
First off, welcome to the group!<br/>
 <br/>
This is a tough one for me, becuase I am very much the same way, so I <br/>
am jsut going to share what we did on this homefront. lol.. Instead <br/>
of &quot;correcting&quot; her about the reindeer, I would get a whole bunch of <br/>
books out of the library on reindeers, leave them strewed around the <br/>
house and when she goes to look at them she will realize in her own <br/>
mind, oh hey, its not a reindeer , then she will ask, &quot;mom if its not <br/>
a reindeer becuase this is a reindeer, then what is it?&quot;  then you <br/>
can say, &quot;well hun I think its a moose. lets get some books out on <br/>
that&quot;. <br/>
I dont &quot;correct&quot; my children unless I am asked to do so, for example, <br/>
if your daughter had asked &quot;is that a reindeer?&quot; you could say, &quot;I <br/>
think its a moose. Lets look it up or ask one of the museum people&quot; . <br/>
If she isnt asking you a question, then shes not asking you to <br/>
correct her. As for the letter P. I would say well the letter P makes <br/>
phhh (the sound of p lol), and one sounds whhh (sound of o lol) whats <br/>
your thoughts? <br/>
That way your not squashing her at all, your giving her the tools to <br/>
think deeper. If she chooses to look at you and say nope its a <br/>
P...then let her be, she has plenty of time to figure it all out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-33670713">Hello -<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m fairly new to unschoolingbasics, but I saw your post and had to <br/>
respond.  I am exactly the same way with my two daughters - not <br/>
correcting them, enjoying their excitement - &quot;right&quot; answer or not.  My <br/>
older daughter was unusually interested in letters and numbers from a <br/>
very young age.  She could barely talk, but she could babytalk the <br/>
names of numbers and letters.  One &quot;mistake&quot; she used to make was <br/>
turning her head upside-down and then calling a &quot;W&quot; an &quot;M&quot;.  It seemed <br/>
so absurd to me to be correcting a 15-month-old, so I&#39;d just smile or <br/>
say &quot;yay&quot; or kind of mirror her excitement.  If I would see a &quot;W&quot;, I <br/>
would call it a &quot;W&quot;, but I wouldn&#39;t make a point of doing it at all.  <br/>
Well, all of those &quot;mistakes&quot; just were magically corrected by her, <br/>
without any coaching from me.  And she literally learned how to read - <br/>
sounding words out and everything - beginning at the age of 2 1/2.  <br/>
This also seemed to happen magically.  All I had done up to that point <br/>
was read to her and answer her questions when she pointed to a word and <br/>
asked me what it said.  She&#39;s now 5 1/2 and loves reading and learning. <br/>
 That&#39;s really my goal - to make it fun and positive.<br/>
<br/>
My younger daughter isn&#39;t quite as precocious as far as reading goes <br/>
(she&#39;s just 2 1/2 now), but she is very aware and observant and verbal, <br/>
and the not correcting thing seems to work really well with her, too.  <br/>
The moose/reindeer thing would be a good example in which I would just <br/>
let it go - who really cares, after all?  Interestingly, my older <br/>
daughter &quot;goes along&quot; with that, too - she won&#39;t &quot;correct&quot; her little <br/>
sister.  Perhaps she somehow remembers and appreciates being treated <br/>
that way when she was little!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to you -<br/>
