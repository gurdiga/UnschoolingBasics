DS wants to stay up late and sleep in. Fine. I have my cell phone and DD and <br/>
I go out and have a whole morning of activity sometimes before he is even out <br/>
of bed. Or she has quiet time to do what she wants without big brother bugging <br/>
her.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, it is amazing how he gets up right on time when there is something <br/>
planned that DS wants to do. :)<br/>

Lin, just wondering what difference it makes if your<br/>
12 yo is a night owl?  If you need to do things<br/>
outside of the house, before she wakes up, she&#39;s old<br/>
enough to stay home alone....So what&#39;s the problem? <br/>
If you have things in the morning that she &quot;needs&quot; to<br/>
do, reschedule them for the afternoon?<br/>
