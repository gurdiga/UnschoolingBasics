<div id="ygrps-yiv-954409528">Wow, what an awesome post! THANK YOU REN! (and Danielle!) for &quot;swiping&quot; and <br/>
sharing it with us! That was just what I needed to hear!<br/>
I&#39;m fairly new here to this list (been enjoying it immensely)! and also <br/>
pretty new to un/hsing. I&#39;ve only posted a couple times here and never really <br/>
intro. myself, I guess I should now, especially cuz I need some advice on this one <br/>
BIG TIME! <br/>
<br/>
My name is Nancy, we pulled our dd&#39;s (101/2 & 12) out of ps about a yr. ago. <br/>
We had always talked about hsing, my dh loved the idea, always wanted us to <br/>
and so did I, but I was always too big of a chicken to just go for it.(da, took <br/>
me long enough to see the light!) I had finally just gotten so tired of <br/>
watching our dd&#39;s love of learning slowly diminish down to almost despising it. <br/>
Watching them become more and more turned off towards learning made me sick to my <br/>
stomach, let alone watching all of the other garbage that goes on in the ps <br/>
system and I did see PLENTY of it. I can&#39;t imagine ever sending them back there, <br/>
unless, I suppose, if they really wanted to, but I don&#39;t think I have to <br/>
worry about that, at least not for now! They LOVE unschooling, heck, what kid <br/>
wouldn&#39;t!? I know I would have when I was growing up! &lt;g&gt; When their friends ask <br/>
them if they ever miss school and want to come back I always here them say, <br/>
&quot;Are you kidding!? Why would I want to do that!&quot; We are all so much more happier <br/>
now, I can&#39;t believe the difference unschooling has made in our lives! <br/>
<br/>
Not that there haven&#39;t been a few bumps along the road! We have been &quot;DE&quot; <br/>
schooling ever since we pulled them out a yr ago and I have a feeling we all <br/>
still are! Which brings me to what I need advice on... chores and helping around <br/>
the house! <br/>
<br/>
Over the yrs. we have gotten into such a bad &quot;habit&quot; of looking at what <br/>
should be just plain & simple kindness like &quot;helping around the house&quot; as a BIG <br/>
CHORE instead of what Danielle just decried in this post. I think that was just <br/>
beautiful. I have noticed our youngest do the sort of things mentioned in her <br/>
post now and then, but they, especially our oldest, look at cooking or helping <br/>
prepare meal as &quot;yuk! work&quot; and if I invite them to help me, they (again, <br/>
especially our oldest) are immediately turned off. I allow that and just say &quot;OK, <br/>
maybe another time. But man, I would LOVE to spend time with them in that way! <br/>
They do help take care of the animals most of the time without too much <br/>
hassle but anything else like picking up around the house, forget it. It just turns <br/>
into a big hassle and I end up doing most of it. what a drag! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m afraid we are very far away from the place where Danielle is and I really <br/>
want that for us! Just not sure how to stop the behavior that got us where we <br/>
are now. Any time I do say things like &quot;Hey, would you please take your <br/>
dishes to the kitchen&quot; sometimes you would think I was asking them to clean the <br/>
toilet! LOL! <br/>
<br/>
When they were in school, it always seemed like we were in a hurry to get <br/>
things done, etc., and that (I think) is where the habit started. Always having <br/>
to &quot;get things done&quot; in time for ... whatever was happening at the time. <br/>
(sounds so silly now) It seemed like we were always on the go. We have slowed the <br/>
pace way down since hsing but those old habits are still here and as they say, <br/>
sometimes old habits die hard. I am hoping some of you will have some <br/>
suggestions on how to break this awful &quot;habit&quot; we have all gotten so accustomed to. Do <br/>
most of you just &quot;do it all&quot; and maybe someday they&#39;ll pitch in happily?? Our <br/>
girls are not that young and they are very independent in many ways. I just <br/>
wish they would want to be more involved with all of it, but also feel good <br/>
about it at the same time.I hope I&#39;m making sense as to what is happening around <br/>
here! :o) I&#39;ll stop now, guess I was venting a bit also!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you&#39;ve touched on this subject before so I&#39;m sorry to have the need to <br/>
bring it up again here! This is just one of the biggest obstacles we have come <br/>
across since leaving the whole schooly stuff behind us! Well, besides those <br/>
pesky friends/relatives who &quot;mean well&quot; and are &quot;just concerned&quot; about our <br/>
decision to hs! But, that&#39;s another post I suppose, one I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve all <br/>
touched on many times! Anything ideas you have to offer would be GREATLY <br/>
appreciated! <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening!<br/>

Any time  I do say things like &quot;Hey, would you please take your <br/>
dishes to the  kitchen&quot; sometimes you would think I was asking them to clean <br/>
the <br/>

Hi Nancy!  This is such a hard situation.  We have to mix  family dynamics, a <br/>
history of &quot;have to&#39;s&quot;, and our children&#39;s  personalities.  Neither of my <br/>
children are natural cleaners.  I think  your issues are a challenge for many <br/>
families.<br/>
 <br/>
It is easy and understandable to slip into feeling like we wait on our  <br/>
children like servants!  I try to keep an attitude of gift giving.  It  is a gift <br/>
for a child to not &quot;have to&quot; clean up, and your children are  recovering from <br/>
their school lives of &quot;have to&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
The reason I picked the above quote is not that there is anything wrong  with <br/>
it, it is a legitimate request.  I have tweaked it recently with my  kids.  I <br/>
have been saying &quot;it would be helpful to me if you take your dish  to the <br/>
kitchen&quot;.    A little shift in emphasis, but I have  noticed a difference in some <br/>
of those little things, fewer candy wrappers and  dirty clothes on the floor <br/>
and more dishes brought back in the kitchen.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-471282267">Hello Leslie,<br/>
Thank you for your response! The need and want for your life and home to have <br/>
some sort of order and at least a bit of, LOL, &quot;cleanliness&quot; is a hard <br/>
situation WITH kids! I am not neurotic about them leaving messes around here at all, <br/>
I just get tired of having to pick up after them all the time! It&#39;s <br/>
exhausting! BUT, then I look at them and remember that they are, as you said, <br/>
&quot;recovering from their school lives of Have to&#39;s&quot;, and my heart does soften! ....But <br/>
then I turn around and see the &quot;stuff&quot; that is all over the house and I think <br/>
GEESH! here we go again! &lt;g&gt; &quot;<br/>
<br/>
****it would be helpful to me if you take your dish to the <br/>
kitchen.&quot;    A little shift in emphasis,***** <br/>
I know you are right, I remember when I was young, if my Mom or Dad yelled <br/>
(which for my Dad was all the time) and got all nasty about asking me to do <br/>
things, I rebelled big time and of course, also ended up in a bad mood. I knew if <br/>
I wrote to this group I would get a big shove in the right direction! hee hee! <br/>
Just what I needed! My kids would thank you! and probably my husband too!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the insight,<br/>
Nancy<br/>
