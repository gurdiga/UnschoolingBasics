<div id="ygrps-yiv-1169671866">-=-=-=-&gt;What might &quot;demanding structure&quot; look like for a child who had never been to school?<br/>
<br/>
Here, it looked like an 11 year old who wanted me to make report cards and administer tests.  -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not structure though. That&#39;s a piece of paper and couple of questions.<br/>
<br/>
The structure most people talk about is math at 9:00 and history at 10:00. Regular handwriting practice and grammar lessons. Thirty minutes per day spent reading and/or writing.<br/>
<br/>
Duncan has asked for pages of math on paper. That&#39;s not structure. That&#39;s math on paper! &lt;wg&gt; Structure might look like a child who asks for an hour of a subject each day. I seriously doubt that would happen with an always unschooled kid.<br/>
<br/>
Even when Cameron was sitting in on a college class, the only &quot;structure&quot; part of it was showing up on Tuesdays and Thursdays for class! The rest was spent playing with and discussion the concepts (with me), reading the material, writing the papers, and participating in class.<br/>
<br/>
Some structure is expected when taking a karate class or horseback lessons or being on a baseball team. But structured learning?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the original poster could elaborate?<br/>

<br/>
*I&#39;m* the original poster of the question of what does &quot;demanding structure&quot;<br/>
look like. The prior post was just an opportunity to ask the question of<br/>
everyone that has been nagging at me for a while every time someone posts<br/>
about it.<br/>
<br/>
Using workbooks is not the same as asking for structure. Asking for any of<br/>
the myriad of tools around from books, to maps, to art supplies, to computer<br/>
games, to museum visits, to garden tools, to microscopes, etc, is not what I<br/>
would call &quot;demanding structure&quot;. I think of structure as being more<br/>
intangible than a bunch of tools or objects. I think it relates to time<br/>
management and planning and scheduling, and maybe order and expectations,<br/>
and possibly having someone other than the learner take responsibility for<br/>
how the learner engages in these actions (of time management and so on).   <br/>
<br/>
People often say the phrase &quot;Some kids demand/need/want/ask for structure&quot;.<br/>
I want to know what that looks like when they ask (maybe I have been missing<br/>
something with Jayn). I want to know if it is relevant to children who have<br/>
never been in the time proscribed atmosphere of school or school-at-home. I<br/>
want to know what people mean when they say &quot;structure&quot;.<br/>

I thought your post was a response to my post where I typed &quot;demanding<br/>
structure&quot; instead of &quot;demanding schooly things.&quot;  My wording wasn&#39;t clear,<br/>
I&#39;ve learned.  The chance to have my wording made clearer is a wonderful<br/>
opportunity!  I thank you all so much. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for making me think about the wording and meaning of what I type and<br/>
for helping me make more sense.  <br/>

I look forward to doing it more!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-782154602">&quot;What might &quot;demanding structure&quot; look like for a child who had <br/>
never been to school? &quot;<br/>
<br/>
With Sierra, it comes in the form of a desire to make lists of the <br/>
days plans, know what time things are going to happen, write things <br/>
out on the calender, plan meals etc...<br/>
She adores some structure. She also enjoys a lot of freedom to use <br/>
the structure in HER way.:) She&#39;s very independent.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder about the child that wants report cards and tests. Is this <br/>
a child that has been to school? Because it would really matter in <br/>
how I responded to that child.<br/>
I guess the &quot;why&quot; is really important here.<br/>
Because if Sierra wanted this, I would know it was a game...an idea <br/>
she got from school friends and it wouldn&#39;t mean anything <br/>
significant in how she viewed her capabilities.<br/>
But if this was a schooled child, I would want to make sure they <br/>
didn&#39;t feel they were needing this judgement in their lives as a <br/>
measurement tool. The motivation matters a lot to me.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooled kids often pull in schoolish looking things out of <br/>
curiosity. Their schooled friends do it, so they&#39;re interested. In <br/>
that case, it can just be another thing to learn about, another <br/>
thing to play with. But for a schooled child, there might still be <br/>
some level of mind control leftover from school. I&#39;d want to make <br/>
sure they were healed from that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-862682943">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I heard about this list from Unschoolingdiscussion and thought it might be a<br/>
better place for me to start.  My name is Judy and I have four girls, ages 1<br/>
through 8.  We all ive in NH.  My oldest lives with her father, but the<br/>
other three are here with me.  My 5 yo is in kindergarten this year and my<br/>
third will start preschool in April when she turns three.  I was<br/>
homeschooled for 6 years when I was young and want to do the same for my<br/>
children and the idea of unschooling really appeals to me.  I am seriously<br/>
considering beginning when school lets out this year because I know Moira<br/>
enjoys going to school and seeing her friends.  Kindergarten doesn&#39;t place<br/>
many academic expectations on a child, so I don&#39;t think it will take long to<br/>
deschool her.<br/>
<br/>
As far as report cards go, maybe you could speak to the manager at Krispy<br/>
Kreme and explain what you do and ask what he would accept as a report card.<br/>
<br/>
My kids do have some structure to their lives.  I don&#39;t believe that anyone<br/>
can live a life devoid of order.  They have a set bedtime, we eat meals and<br/>
snacks at predictable times, and DH takes over the TV at the same time every<br/>
day.  I call that a daily order, some might call it structure.<br/>

things that are missing from our home.  We eat when hungry, go to bed <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1063983319">I want to thank folks for the replies thus far, it is helping me to<br/>
understand this. Just to clarify my question further (and most people *were*<br/>
answering it) I find I am less curious to know what &quot;structure&quot; looked like<br/>
in anyone&#39;s home; I am more curious to learn how the children are<br/>
*communicating* their need/desire for structure - how the children define<br/>
structure rather than the parents (I have plenty of residual school-think in<br/>
my definition of what structure might look like). <br/>
<br/>
So to paraphrase the replies, please correct me if I am wrong:<br/>
<br/>
It seems to be a combination of the individual children *asking questions*<br/>
about the immediate upcoming day(s) and joining in the planning - wanting to<br/>
either be informed and/or make notes somehow of the planned and expected<br/>
activities, to the point where in some cases surprises and changes are<br/>
viewed negatively - and *behavioral cues* observed over time by the parents<br/>
such as needing extra time to transition from one activity to another, and<br/>
becoming distressed in varying degrees by spontaneous changes to the plan.<br/>
<br/>
It is not necessarily an overarching schedule that requires absolute routine<br/>
and sameness every day - I mean the kids generally aren&#39;t requesting this.<br/>
The room for extemporaneous action evidently varies depending on<br/>
personality. <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps we would be more accurate to say that some children &quot;need/enjoy more<br/>
advance planning to feel secure&quot; than simply say &quot;demand structure&quot;. <br/>

With Sierra, she asks me what time it is, what date it is and wants <br/>
to write things on the calender. Then she wants to write out times <br/>
and make lists of what we will do at those times. She asks me to set <br/>
a time for her to do &quot;school&quot; and sits down to do workbooks (yuck, <br/>
ptooey!!);)<br/>
She wants to make lists of what we will buy at the store, when we <br/>
will go etc...<br/>
She adores structure. Structure is not a dirty word to me though, it <br/>
just means an outline, a framework. We have loads of freedom within <br/>
her framework (thank goodness...she&#39;s not overly stressed by changes <br/>
to the structure).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so freefloating, I frustrate her sometimes. It&#39;s a challenge to <br/>
try and help her with structure when I adore freedom to fly by the <br/>

out what subjects he wanted to learn.  Lists are a big thing to him - not to<br/>
me.  Though his list would change throughout the year, he still wanted a<br/>
list of subjects that he could learn for &quot;school.&quot;  One year, he got on the<br/>
computer and looked up curriculum to use!  I bought a Power Glide French<br/>
course for him and I always have to buy Math workbooks.  That&#39;s what he<br/>
enjoys.  <br/>
<br/>
He is trying out public school for the first time in his life this year.  He<br/>
went from waking up at 10:00 or later, all his life, to waking up at 5:00am<br/>
to play two hours of Diablo II before his carpool arrived!  He is soooo<br/>
different from me.  And the horrifying thing is, he loves the structure of<br/>
school though he has never been.  He loves that game.  He has only slept<br/>
through his alarm once, so far this year.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When I hear people mention &quot;order&quot; it usually implies that being <br/>
devoid of order is chaos.  Maybe to highly structured people our <br/>
lives do seem like chaos, but I really think that my kids each have <br/>
their own &quot;order&quot;  Keon is the only one that has a set bedtime and <br/>
that is only because he doesn&#39;t have the ability at this time in his <br/>
life to self-regulate many aspects of his life.  However, I have <br/>
figured out when he is tired and that is his &quot;bedtime&quot; and it is <br/>
flexible depending on many factors.  We all eat breakfast at <br/>
different times.  We usually all eat lunch at different times.  <br/>
Dinner is fixed at generally the same time each day, but that <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean we are all eating it at the same time.  About the only <br/>
time that really happens is if we go out for a meal (which is fairly <br/>
rare).  There always seems to be someone cooking in my kitchen.  And <br/>
I&#39;ve found ways to allow even Keon to be able to prepare food for <br/>
himself (he can make ramen and mac&#39;n cheese and popcorn and heat <br/>
soup all in the microwave).  And sometimes I feel like I am in the <br/>
kitchen all day cooking (which is really fine with me because I <br/>
enjoy cooking!)  <br/>
<br/>
For fun once I actually wrote when my kids did things.  When they <br/>
rose, when they slept, when they ate, and they all had fairly <br/>
predictible patterns, but they were each unique to each child.  So <br/>
they each have their own &quot;order&quot; so to speak.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1774014361">Perhaps I am seeing this issue only from my experience with my own children.<br/>
My children are 5 and under.  Their birthdays are in April.  Lauren (2 yo)<br/>
gets incredibly cranky by dinnertime if I don&#39;t make her take a nap.  Moira<br/>
(5 yo) is quite happy to stay up until 1 am, and often does when we have our<br/>
friends over every other weekend for table top gaming.    I am not yet<br/>
unschooling and Moira is in kindergarten, so she has to be up in time to get<br/>
on the bus, which means she has to go to bed by a certain time every night<br/>
to get enough sleep.  I do let them lay in bed reading (or looking at the<br/>
pictures) for as long as they like every night.  Usually they are all asleep<br/>
within an hour.  On weekends I am far more lax.  They get to stay up later<br/>
and they can get up whenever they feel like, but Lauren is predictably up<br/>
between 6 and 6:30 every morning.<br/>
<br/>
My girls could (and have) convince(d) anyone that I starve them within a<br/>
half hour of eating a huge meal.  I feel strongly that family meals are an<br/>
important opportunity for parents to model good manners and for everyone in<br/>
the family to connect and socialize, so eating meals together is a must for<br/>
me.  Snacks are far more casual and can be eaten within a broad timeframe<br/>
(not within an hour of dinner so that they don&#39;t take one bite and say they<br/>
are full), and can be eaten pretty much anywhere except upstairs in their<br/>
bedrooms.  I do regulate what they can eat because I feel strongly about<br/>
good nutrition and if left on their own, they will see nothing wrong with<br/>
eating junk food all day.<br/>
<br/>
As for the TV, I let them watch as close to all they want as is reasonable.<br/>
My husband has shows he likes to watch in the late morning, so after the<br/>
girls have watched 4 hours of TV, it is his turn.  And that is how we view<br/>
it.  Whenever multiple people want to use the same thing but differently,<br/>
they have to take turns and share.  TV is the same way in our house.<br/>
Sometimes, though, I will shut it off and not let anyone watch for a little<br/>
bit because I grew up without a TV and having it on *all* the time drives me<br/>
batty.  I have to have some quiet in the house sometimes.  That is my turn<br/>
with the TV.  :)  When I don&#39;t take my turn, the rest of the family has it<br/>
on from 6 am to 10 or 11 pm.  Lauren will sometimes watch TV for a while,<br/>
then get up and shut it off and go do something else, usually playing with<br/>
her sister Rowan (12 mo).  The first time I saw that I was shocked.  I had<br/>
never seen a child voluntarily shut off the TV.<br/>
<br/>
I see my role of parent as being that of provider and protector.  I see a<br/>
lot of emphasis on provider in all the info I have found on unschooling, but<br/>
the protector part seems to be overlooked, at least in what I have found.<br/>
There is a reason why humans rear their children for roughly two decades,<br/>
instead of leaving them to their own devices from day one like reptiles do.<br/>
I need to protect my children from making foolish decisions that will cause<br/>
themselves pain or harm, and so I step in and give them the benefit of my<br/>
experience and wisdom.  Wow, that sounds really condescending, but I can&#39;t<br/>
think of a better way to phrase it right now.  At such a young age, my<br/>
children don&#39;t have the experience or knowledge to make decisions about what<br/>
kinds of food to eat.  The relationship between diet and health is too<br/>
abstract for them right now.  It is easier to relate too much sugar to an<br/>
upset tummy than it is to relate the fact that you don&#39;t have the flu that<br/>
is going around to the fact that you take cod liver oil every day.  Lauren<br/>
still doesn&#39;t really grasp the idea that she gets cranky by 5 or 6 pm<br/>
because she didn&#39;t take a nap.  Then she has temper tantrums and misbehaves<br/>
and gets yelled at for it and everyone is miserable.  She doesn&#39;t like<br/>
getting yelled at, we don&#39;t like yelling, and it all could have been<br/>
prevented with a simple nap.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this clarifies my position on &quot;structure&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-798489769">I&#39;m not sure what to envision.  That is my problem.  I hear tons of what is<br/>
*not* done, but little of what *is* done.  I know that I can&#39;t be doing too<br/>
much wrong because everyone tells me what wonderful, happy children I have.<br/>
<br/>
How do you help your children recognize when they need sleep?  From birth<br/>
mine have all refused to acknowledge that they are tired even as their eyes<br/>
droop and their heads fall.  As babies, I lay them down for naps when they<br/>
start getting cranky or rubbing their eyes a lot.  It doesn&#39;t matter what<br/>
time it is.  As they get older and one nap is enough for them but none is<br/>
too little, I set a time for them because they haven&#39;t shown me that they<br/>
will sleep for themselves.  Sometimes Lauren does come to me and ask me for<br/>
a nap.  She has probably done that twice ever and she will be 3 in April.<br/>
Moira routinely stayed up until 1 am as a baby with no bedtime until I<br/>
started putting her to bed earlier so I could go to bed earlier and get the<br/>
sleep that I needed to make it through the day without falling asleep at<br/>
work (which I often did because I was so tired staying up with her).  I<br/>
understand that everyone thrives on a different schedule, but sometimes it<br/>
is impossible to accommodate a particular schedule.  Even with not going to<br/>
school or if you own your own business, there are still other outside forces<br/>
that influence one&#39;s schedule.  I would like to know how others work around<br/>
the schedules imposed on us by society and nature.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1692845126">***Perhaps I am seeing this issue only from my experience with my own<br/>
children.***<br/>
<br/>
Probably! &lt;g&gt;  That&#39;s how all of us see these issues. <br/>
<br/>
***Lauren (2 yo) gets incredibly cranky by dinnertime if I don&#39;t make her<br/>
take a nap.***<br/>
<br/>
When you say &quot;make her take a nap&quot; do you mean you leave a cranky,<br/>
unhappy child alone in her bed and threaten her if she doesn&#39;t go to<br/>
sleep?   Or do you mean you rock her and nurse her and when she falls<br/>
asleep you put her down?  Or do you mean something else.  I think it<br/>
would help us to know.<br/>
<br/>
Dylan really liked to nurse in mid afternoon when he was tired. <br/>
Sometimes he would doze a little, while I held him.  But he&#39;d be<br/>
energized again in a few minutes and on the go.  It was the times he fell<br/>
asleep and really napped that he was the most cranky.   <br/>
We used to joke that we had banned naps at our house.  <br/>
<br/>
What I think Dylan really needed and it proved to be true, was some close<br/>
contact and some nutrition.  Maybe your daughter really benefits from a<br/>
nap but maybe she&#39;d benefit just as much from forty minutes of snuggling<br/>
and some nursing. <br/>
<br/>
And maybe, if nap time is a fight, the benefits of napping in the end<br/>
won&#39;t outweigh the detriments of fighting with mom. <br/>
<br/>
***I am not yet unschooling and Moira is in kindergarten,***<br/>
<br/>
Well, that&#39;s important. This is an unschooling list.  What you&#39;re writing<br/>
may speak to some people, but it&#39;s not unschooling advice.  <br/>
<br/>
***I feel strongly that family meals are an<br/>
important opportunity for parents to model good manners and for everyone<br/>
in<br/>
the family to connect and socialize, so eating meals together is a must<br/>
for<br/>
me. ***<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever struggled to get your kids to the table or fought with them<br/>
about what or how much they&#39;re eating?  If so, do you consider that<br/>
modeling good manners?   I think good manners is trusting a person, even<br/>
a little one, to know if they&#39;re hungry and to know if they want to join<br/>
the rest of the family at the dinner table.  It think honoring their<br/>
feelings models respect and kindness.   Maybe your kids love family<br/>
dinner time as much as you and you&#39;ve never had to push to get them to<br/>
participate. <br/>
<br/>
Dylan is home with me all day so we&#39;ve never been disconnected.  His dad<br/>
works but sometimes comes home later than Dylan likes to eat so they<br/>
don&#39;t always eat together.  I don&#39;t think it would help Dylan&#39;s<br/>
relationship with his dad if I made him wait and eat with David.  It<br/>
don&#39;t think their socializing would be as pleasant if Dylan had been<br/>
hungry for an hour but was made to wait to eat with his dad.  I don&#39;t<br/>
think I&#39;d be modeling good manners to make him wait.     But really,<br/>
since Dylan isn&#39;t in school, we don&#39;t have the pressing need to schedule<br/>
time with him.  He&#39;s right here.  He&#39;s here all day.  <br/>
<br/>
***Snacks are far more casual and can be eaten within a broad timeframe<br/>
(not within an hour of dinner so that they don&#39;t take one bite and say<br/>
they<br/>
are full),***<br/>
<br/>
If the idea of dinner is to ensure a body eats, then I don&#39;t understand<br/>
the concern about a body getting full before dinner.  Food is food at<br/>
four in the afternoon and it&#39;s food at five.  Children don&#39;t get sick<br/>
from eating an apple five minutes before dinner and then skipping dinner.<br/>
 Sometimes an apple is all a body needs.  A child won&#39;t forever want to<br/>
eat apples instead of dinner. <br/>
<br/>
***I do regulate what they can eat because I feel strongly about<br/>
good nutrition and if left on their own, they will see nothing wrong with<br/>
eating junk food all day.***<br/>
<br/>
Filtering through my own experience with my kid, who&#39;s never been to<br/>
school and who will be thirteen in May:  I&#39;ve never regulated what he<br/>
eats and he&#39;s never eaten junk food all day long.   He likes to feel good<br/>
and he knows he feels best when he has plenty of water, some protein,<br/>
some veggies and fruit.   Yes, he likes chips and Coke and popcorn, but<br/>
he&#39;s never only eaten those things and I&#39;ve never told him he couldn&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
I think the reason he has never eaten so called &quot;junk&quot; food all day is<br/>
because I never told him some food was junk and should be consumed<br/>
sparingly.  Chips aren&#39;t more exciting than oranges, they&#39;re just one<br/>
more choice in a house full of choices. <br/>
<br/>
***Lauren will sometimes watch TV for a while,<br/>
then get up and shut it off and go do something else, usually playing<br/>
with<br/>
her sister Rowan (12 mo).  The first time I saw that I was shocked.  I<br/>
had<br/>
never seen a child voluntarily shut off the TV.***<br/>
<br/>
I think you might be pleasantly surprised to learn that just like a child<br/>
free to watch TV will know when she doesn&#39;t want to watch, a child free<br/>
to eat when and what she wants will also choose to not eat junk food all<br/>
day.  A child free to sleep when she wants will sleep when she&#39;s tired.  <br/>
<br/>
***I have found on unschooling, but the protector part seems to be<br/>
overlooked, at least in what I have found.***<br/>
<br/>
This list has 455 members unschooling or learning about unschooling live<br/>
children.  I don&#39;t think they are careless about protecting their kids. <br/>
What I think is they are realistic about what real danger is.  Danger is<br/>
not a graham cracker an hour before dinner.  Danger is not an extra hour<br/>
of TV.  Danger is not a missed nap. <br/>
<br/>
My son is very well and he was never made to nap, never made to eat<br/>
dinner with the family, never made to turn off the TV.  Yet he sleeps<br/>
when he&#39;s tired, eats when he&#39;s hungry, watches only as much TV as he<br/>
wants.  He was never run over by stampeding buffalo or eaten by wolves. <br/>
He did smack his head on the coffee table and need stitches when he was<br/>
about four but that&#39;s been his only serious injury.  <br/>
<br/>
***I need to protect my children from making foolish decisions that will<br/>
cause<br/>
themselves pain or harm, and so I step in and give them the benefit of my<br/>
experience and wisdom.***<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll find unschoolers on this list advising parents to<br/>
leave their children to their own devises.  We share our experiences with<br/>
our kids all day long, every day.  But my need to protect Dylan may not<br/>
serve Dylan&#39;s need to be his own person, to learn about the world his own<br/>
way and to live his own life.  I would absolutely stop him if he said he<br/>
was going to throw himself under a train, but incredibly he&#39;s never<br/>
wanted to. ; )  He wants to be ok.  He wants to feel good, be healthy,<br/>
have a good life and so his life is less about &quot;my need&quot; to protect him<br/>
and more about his own self awareness and understanding.<br/>
<br/>
***At such a young age, my children don&#39;t have the experience or<br/>
knowledge to make decisions about what<br/>
kinds of food to eat.***<br/>
<br/>
I think you mean they don&#39;t have the knowledge or experience to make the<br/>
choices you&#39;ll approve of.  I bet they can and do make decisions about<br/>
what kinds of food to eat.  I bet if you offered your kids apple slices<br/>
and cheese and grapes and broccoli and salad dressing for dipping and<br/>
some chips they&#39;d eat just what they liked from what you offered and they<br/>
wouldn&#39;t go out in the driveway and eat spiders and grasshoppers. <br/>
<br/>
***than it is to relate the fact that you don&#39;t have the flu that<br/>
is going around to the fact that you take cod liver oil every day. ***<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t get the flu and I&#39;ve never even considered taking cod liver oil.<br/>
 How do you account for those people who don&#39;t catch flu and who don&#39;t<br/>
take cod liver oil?   I eat chocolate almost everyday.  Maybe that&#39;s why<br/>
I didn&#39;t catch the flu. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
***Lauren still doesn&#39;t really grasp the idea that she gets cranky by 5<br/>
or 6 pm<br/>
because she didn&#39;t take a nap.***<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s very young.  She didn&#39;t learn to walk right away either, she didn&#39;t<br/>
learn how to blow her nose right away, or how to take off some clothes<br/>
when she got too hot.  Learning our body  signals is a very personal<br/>
thing.  Some adults still don&#39;t understand when they&#39;re over stressed,<br/>
etc.  Because a child hasn&#39;t learned she feels better with more sleep<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean she&#39;ll never learn it and it doesn&#39;t mean she needs to be<br/>
made to do so according to someone else&#39;s schedule.  You wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
insisted she walk at two months and you wouldn&#39;t have insisted she dress<br/>
herself at six months.  Insisting she sleeps when you decide she&#39;s tired<br/>
won&#39;t help her come to her own conclusions about how much sleep she needs<br/>
and when.   Helping her find peaceful sleep when you notice she&#39;s tired<br/>
is a kindness though, and will go along way to helping her understand her<br/>
body&#39;s signals.  <br/>
<br/>
***Then she has temper tantrums and misbehaves<br/>
and gets yelled at for it and everyone is miserable. ***<br/>
<br/>
Is yelling &quot;behaving?&quot;  Do you think you&#39;re misbehaving when you yell at<br/>
a two year old?  You&#39;re trying to get a two year old to sleep to avoid<br/>
crankiness by being cranky yourself?  I think you may not be modeling<br/>
what you wish you were modeling.  <br/>
<br/>
***She doesn&#39;t like getting yelled at, we don&#39;t like yelling, and it all<br/>
could have been<br/>
prevented with a simple nap.***<br/>
<br/>
It could have been prevented by kind understanding and choosing not to<br/>
yelling.  If a person doesn&#39;t like yelling they never have to yell.  <br/>
When your spouse is tired and cranky do you yell at him?  Would you yell<br/>
at a guest who was tired and cranky?  She doesn&#39;t get yelled at because<br/>
she didn&#39;t take a nap, she gets yelled at because *you* yell.  She gets<br/>
tired when she doesn&#39;t take a nap, she gets cranky, maybe she gets<br/>
overwhelmed easily.  Those things are a natural consequence of being<br/>
overtired.  Getting yelled at is not.  Yelling is caused every single<br/>
time by the yeller.   Loving kindness and understanding, holding and<br/>
rocking can help a tired child to sleep.  It can help her trust you, can<br/>
help her love you, can help her feel better about falling asleep, can<br/>
help her learn about kindness.  The benefits are endless.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1551208046">Hi Judy<br/>
<br/>
A &quot;typical&quot; day if there ever is one goes as such. My kids are all over the age of 5 - the youngest two are 6 but they don&#39;t eat meals as such. They prefer to graze when they are hungry on food of their choice. This - strangely enough -is not usually junk food or rubbish but usually their choices are for fruit, cereal, maybe crisps now and then or sandwiches. The older kids like meals but never like the same food as each other.  I do one meal that most like and plate if off so they can have it when they are ready to eat and the ones who don&#39;t want it make themselves something else.  Every Sunday we have a meal together which they like.<br/>
<br/>
Dh doesn&#39;t watch T.V during the day. He is busy working on our house so only watches it at night. The two youngest put Nick Junior on for a couple of hours from say 6 am - til  8 and then turn it off. They play games, play with they toys, read books with me if they want and watch dv.d&#39;s, draw, paint, go on the computer or go out on the trampoline in our garden. Some days we go out to places. Some days we have friends in.  It depends.  The older ones do similar stuff except the don&#39;t watch T.V during the day unless it is something they specifically want to see.  That was not a rule made by me or dh. Just how they do it.  The older ones have ongoing projects they picked they do when they want to do them and they see friends, go on the computer and go places as well. They eat when they are hungry and get snacks when they like. I don&#39;t bother if they can&#39;t eat a main meal cos I  would leave it in the fridge and someone will always have it. I if they don&#39;t eat it. I don&#39;t  mind.<br/>
<br/>
The older ones have the T.V in the front room every night but prefer to go up about 8.30 to do stuff in their rooms.( what that stuff is I have no idea!!!) They go to sleep about 11 ish.The 6 year olds are not sleepers. They sleep for about 3 hours and play all night from 11 pm until about 4 when they go to sleep while 6 ish..  It works well.  It is not chaos even tho there are 7 children basically to all appearances doing what they like. At the moment I am typing and it is quiet. All I can hear is the twins playing a game. I love unschooling.<br/>

time and we still do often, but if we want to eat in front of the TV for a <br/>
favorite show, it makes it more special that we do it together.  My dh isn&#39;t home <br/>
for supper most nights until after we&#39;ve eaten, so it&#39;s not a full family <br/>
dinner anyway.  Also, the stress the &quot;rule&quot; about eating together created <br/>
sometimes took away all the pleasure.<br/>
<br/>
As far as lunchtime, usually my kids fix their own lunch, so we rarely sit <br/>
down together at lunch time.  My 13yos get out of bed around 10 (give or take an <br/>
hour or so) so he&#39;s not ready for lunch with my 9yod and I.  We all eat when <br/>
we feel like it.  <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, now that we don&#39;t have that &quot;rule&quot;, we sit down and enjoy <br/>
more meals together.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And when we decide how we want life to be and then try to make others <br/>
want the same -- or at least conform to our wishes -- then we create <br/>
our own problems.<br/>
<br/>
While my family does eat dinner together, we do it on the couch in <br/>
front of the TV. There&#39;s no &quot;Could you pass the peas, please,&quot; modeled. <br/>
Nothing that anyone would see as &quot;table manners.&quot; And yet my daughter <br/>
knows how to eat at a table in polite company. It didn&#39;t take years of <br/>
training. All it took were occasional Sunday dinners with the <br/>
Grandparents, eating at restaurants and so on. I didn&#39;t make her stay <br/>
at the table at the Grandparents&#39;. But she absorbed up enough manners <br/>
that when she was ready to stay she knew how to ask for more food, how <br/>
to pass, how to use a napkin and so on and so on.<br/>
<br/>
While I agree that family meals are a good opportunity to connect. And <br/>
connecting is a good goal. :-) But if you focus on the meals as being <br/>
the means to that goal, then making everyone eat dinner together <br/>
replaces the goal of connecting. The goal then become eating together <br/>
and it interferes with the goal of connecting. Does that make sense?<br/>
<br/>
Connecting can&#39;t be forced or it becomes a playact. Or a struggle.<br/>
<br/>
If, instead, the goal is connecting, then there are numerous ways we <br/>
can find to connect, numerous opportunities we can take advantage of. <br/>
And if they&#39;re things kids naturally want to do, then we don&#39;t need to <br/>
make them :-)<br/>
<br/>
For instance, kids often love to talk on the phone to Daddy at work. <br/>
You could have a set time they could call each day to tell him what <br/>
they&#39;re up to. Again, that might not work in your particular situation <br/>
which is why it&#39;s hard to tell people what to do. But the point is to <br/>
think outside the box of family dinner = connection.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;d like to have family dinner then set your goal as having a time <br/>
that kids want to come to. Let them stay as long as they want. Don&#39;t <br/>
make dinner a training time for manners that they need to obey. That <br/>
will just make them want to avoid it. Model good manners. Help them be <br/>
polite but gently so. Don&#39;t expect obedience. Just help them. If they <br/>
want to bring games to play at the dinner table while they spend time <br/>
with you, don&#39;t let your idea of what family dinner &quot;should&quot; be <br/>
interfere with their attempts to connect with you.<br/>
<br/>
(If there were specific problems you were having, we might have ideas <br/>
if you us about them.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1970697313">I don&#39;t usually have a hard time getting the kids to come to the dinner<br/>
table.  It&#39;s a matter of getting them to be patient and wait until it is<br/>

together is best (aside from the benefit of not having to reheat your food).<br/>
If it does indeed only apply to families that are apart most of the time,<br/>
perhaps I will relax on this.  It does make sense, now that you point that<br/>
out.  Maybe I can also adjust dinner and see if I can find a better time for<br/>
us to eat with trial and error.  Moira gets home from school at 4:00, and<br/>
the first thing she asks every day is, &quot;Can we have snack?&quot;  Maybe there<br/>
will be less tension about food if I make dinner to be ready then and after<br/>
dinner they can snack as they like until they go to bed.  Thanks.<br/>

  separated all day do.  Letting go of some Brady Bunch idea of what dinner<br/>
  should be was the best thing I ever did for our family.  It made meal<br/>
times<br/>
  much more enjoyable.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I cook a dinner meal most nights and the kids (8 and 10) almost always<br/>
  choose to sit at the table and eat with us.  (although they don&#39;t have to)<br/>
  My husband works away from home part of the time and so often it&#39;s just<br/>
the<br/>
  girls and I.  I make some kind of meal most nights and we each choose from<br/>
  that meal or something else that is easy to prepare (frozen veggies, I<br/>
keep<br/>
  cooked rice and pasta in the fridge, cereal, toast, fruit)  When he is<br/>
home,<br/>
  he is home all day and he makes better connections with the girls away<br/>
from<br/>
  the dinner table anyway.  He really connects with them when they play<br/>
  computer games together or talk about some other interest that they share.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-541897038">We generally have a cooked meal at dinner time (when I get home from <br/>
work I&#39;m usually hungry) and DH is a great cook. DS will usually <br/>
join us but sometimes he&#39;d rather take his plate back to watch <br/>
whatever he was watching. We&#39;ll assist if needed (for instance, he <br/>
can&#39;t leave the plate and come back for a beverage because our two <br/>
big chow hound dogs will have a go at his dinner so we&#39;ll help carry <br/>
everything out at once). Mostly, I use dinner as a time to unwind <br/>
and connect before and after it. I&#39;ll talk with DS right when I get <br/>
home (BIG important thing - reconnecting with him immediately, <br/>
letting the mail sit, etc - is really important in creating a <br/>
peaceful evening for us) and I&#39;ll chat with DH as we finish eating <br/>
and pack up leftovers and stuff. Often, DH and I will be reading <br/>
magazine articles over dinner and sharing interesting bits with each <br/>
other.</div>

Judy, this list is geared for the &quot;basics&quot; of unschooling and the other <br/>
list that you were just referred to is for unschooling families with <br/>
young children.  However, you&#39;re still going to find &quot;discussion&quot; on <br/>
both of these lists.  That&#39;s how ideas are presented and examined and <br/>
exchanged.  You won&#39;t find a &quot;how to&quot; list to follow and check off.  <br/>
Discussion *is* the purpose of these lists.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-965332941">Hmm, I think I may have worded it poorly.  I meant the UnschoolingDiscussion<br/>
list didn&#39;t seem to be what I needed.  It seemed more geared towards<br/>
veterans.  I understand that discussion will be on all the lists.  I just<br/>
abbreviated the name of the other group.  Sorry for the confusion.<br/>
