<div id="ygrps-yiv-205019818">Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
My name&#39;s Jacqueline, I&#39;m sixteen years old and I live in Ontario,<br/>
Canada. I&#39;m about to start the second semester of grade 11, but I&#39;m<br/>
interested in...well, dropping out and schooling myself. I&#39;ve read<br/>
stories of other unschooled kids, lots of articles, and I just<br/>
finished reading the Teenage Liberation Handbook last night. I&#39;m sort<br/>
of oscillating between giddy excitement at this whole new vista that&#39;s<br/>
opening up to me, and anxiety and fear. The regular school system is<br/>
all I&#39;ve known for the past decade or so, and the prospect of just<br/>
leaving it all behind (especially when I only have a year and a half<br/>
left to go) is pretty scary. Plus, I would miss my friends, my music<br/>
extracurriculars, and the guaranteed way to get into university.<br/>
<br/>
Thankfully, my parents are supportive of me and I think that once they<br/>
figure out what exactly unschooling is all about they will be okay<br/>
with my decision. I want to do this, but it&#39;s daunting. I read about<br/>
all these kids my age who bike around South America and work on farms<br/>
and do exchanges and find mentors, and it&#39;s rather intimidating. I&#39;m a<br/>
shy, introverted, bookwormy girl who needs some beginning advice on<br/>
what to do with herself. Thank you very much. :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Okay, so far you&#39;ve pretty much only mentioned the disadvantages of<br/>
deciding to drop out and unschool yourself. What do you hope/think<br/>
you&#39;ll gain from it? <br/>
 <br/>
Btw, I&#39;m pretty sure that they have the GED and the SAT and such in<br/>
Canada as well, which should be able to get you into university. I<br/>
don&#39;t know whether Canadian universities expect you to write a college<br/>
application letter, but if they do, you could use that opportunity to<br/>
explain to them why you decided to unschool yourself, despite having<br/>
had only 1.5 years left in normal school. They&#39;d probably expect some<br/>
explanation, or at least a well-argued explanation might help you get<br/>
in. Basically, this is the same question as above... What do you expect<br/>
to gain from unschooling yourself, except that you&#39;ll end up writing it<br/>
in over a year from now, so that it&#39;ll be &quot;what did you gain from it&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure how university is in Canada, btw, but university here in<br/>
Texas is pretty similar to highschool (in The Netherlands)... I hate<br/>
it. Too many compulsory subjects, too much rote memorization, too much<br/>
repetition, too many classes in which attendance iss compulsory, and<br/>
then on top of that huge lectures with 200-300 people (which is the<br/>
only thing not like highschool). Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love learning,<br/>
but university is not really any better than highschool. I&#39;m dropping<br/>
out and thinking about perhaps applying to grad school in a few years<br/>
(which will not be easy, if at all possible), if I happen to teach<br/>
myself the stuff I need to know, and if I don&#39;t teach myself the stuff<br/>
I need to know, apparently I didn&#39;t care enough to begin with. <br/>
<br/>
This is not meant to tell you that you shouldn&#39;t go to university, just<br/>
that it might be easier if you stay in school and then go to<br/>
university, rather than tasting the freedom and then being locked up<br/>
again. <br/>

outside your home, so it definitely doesn&#39;t mean you have to go to<br/>
another continent on your own. In fact, if going to another<br/>
continent/country sounds interesting to you, you might very well be<br/>
happier with something a bit more structured like being an exchange<br/>
student. I was an exchange student in Thailand, and it was pretty much<br/>
like unschooling (even the English teachers didn&#39;t particularly speak<br/>
English, so I spent most of the first months teaching myself Thai and<br/>
drawing, dancing, etc), but it was structured in the sense that I had a<br/>
host family, and a school that gave me the drawing and dancing lessons<br/>
and such. Lots of freedom, but not too much. If you want to be an<br/>
exchange student, you should definitely start looking into that very<br/>
seriously right now, because it takes almost half a year for<br/>
organisations like AFS to deal with all the administrative stuff etc.<br/>
<br/>
But anyway, if you just want to stay at home and go to your local<br/>
library and bookstore and teach yourself, that&#39;s just as good as going<br/>
abroad, and definitely a lot cheaper/safer/easier. What are your<br/>
interests? What do you want to major in at university, or do you not<br/>
know yet? In fact, depending on your goals, it wouldn&#39;t hurt to try the<br/>
GED and SAT now, and perhaps just go to university a year sooner than<br/>
intended (that&#39;s what my HB did). But if you don&#39;t know what you want<br/>
to do with your life yet, unschooling might help you find the answer<br/>
quicker than uni would. <br/>
<br/>
Aka, it all depends, lots of stuff to think about, I&#39;d imagine.<br/>
