<div id="ygrps-yiv-398140912">I think at some point before Live and Learn Ren mentioned that there were<br/>
people in this group that did counseling less expensively than Naomi Aldort.<br/>
But Ren never elaborated on it and it got lost in the shuffle around LNL. I<br/>
think I am on the right path and unschooling just fine but it would be<br/>
amazing to have some one to talk to about certain things that are most<br/>
challenging to me. I have started a local unschooling group (weekly) and<br/>
that is a great start to a supportive network but I still don&#39;t have a<br/>
support center irl just yet. I have used the im feature on gmail once to<br/>
help me sort through an interesting dilemma. I would like to have the option<br/>
of talking to a real person. The cheaper the better, lol.<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Faith<br/>

Dayna Martin started a support group, Unschooling United, whose<br/>
facilitators offer *free* phone support. Some offer local meetings, as<br/>
well - more info here:<br/>

If you join Unschooling United, you can get a free call with Dayna -<br/>
which I think would be worth much more than the membership fee, she is<br/>
really awesome! <br/>

<br/>
I charge $25 per session with some follow-up emails free. A session is<br/>
about 1/2 hour, with some leeway on time for the first one.:)<br/>
<br/>
I have found that if I respond to everyone that asks, without any fee<br/>
whatsoever, it takes too much time from my family. I already work<br/>
outside the home and this is one way I can support my family as I work<br/>
towards being back at home and earning an income.<br/>
<br/>
The sessions are very support based and designed around your specific<br/>
needs at the time. Some people just want a friendly voice to reaffirm<br/>
their choices, other people are very &quot;stuck&quot; and need a shift in<br/>
perspective.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve worked with people on parenting issues but also on excavating<br/>
their authentic voice and/or creative self. It&#39;s very free flowing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-15751189">That sounds awesome. I met Dayna at the NEU conference and she seemed put<br/>
off by me (personally). She was uncomfortable with some of the choices I was<br/>
talking about for my family that i was totally comfortable about.<br/>
So Ren, how do you work this?<br/>
