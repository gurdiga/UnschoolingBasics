<div id="ygrps-yiv-1680489351">I feel it is important make sure my very fair skinned red head wears<br/>
sunscreen.  He is not quite old enough to understand skin cancer and<br/>
the ill effects of too much sun on his skin.  We find ways of making<br/>
sure he is protected.  He will wear hats, long pants or sleeves,<br/>
sometimes I apply it while he plays, sometimes I explain what can<br/>
happen, other times I ask him where he needs it.  He really liked the<br/>
blue-colored sunscreen too.  It&#39;s really important that he wears it in<br/>
certain situations.  If he were to burn and be caused great pain I<br/>
would feel responsible mostly because of his age.  <br/>

My oldest has never worn sunscreen and does not burn.  I have<br/>
explained why I would like him to wear a light sunscreen but he refuses.<br/>

IMHO humans NEED the sun, in fact, 77% of cancers are caused by a lack of Vitamin D, which we make when we&#39;re exposed to the Sun.<br/>

<br/>
Sunblock is a &quot;drug company&quot; product, and should be used in the same way vaccines and antibiotics are used, which is &quot;cautiously&quot;<br/>

I think where people&#39;s thinking gets stuck is in unconsciously seeing  <br/>
sunscreen (and sugar and preservatives and video games) like magic  <br/>
juju. Miss performing the ritual once (or let the evil in once) and  <br/>
your child is screwed.<br/>
<br/>
One sunburn, or even several dozen sunburns, are not going to cause  <br/>
cancer. A lifetime spent in the sun will up the chances. A 2 yo isn&#39;t  <br/>
even in the danger zone.<br/>
<br/>
Make the information available, make it easy for him to choose to do  <br/>
it (with substances he likes) and it&#39;s more likely he&#39;ll choose to  <br/>
wear it when he&#39;s older than if you force him when he&#39;s younger.<br/>

Search for sunscreen at the list&#39;s website. There have been several  <br/>
discussions in the past:<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t use sunscreen on my kids (3 yo and 10 months). I&#39;m just <br/>
trying to avoid them playing in direct sun, because of danger of <br/>
sunburning. It&#39;s more important to me to be sure that my kids get <br/>
enough vitamin D during the summer. The skin cancer is curable, but <br/>
the lack of the vitamin D can cause more dangerous illnesses.<br/>
<br/>
About helmet... I&#39;m from Russia and never wore one while riding my <br/>
bike near my house. But here, while biking on the road, it&#39;s very <br/>
wise to wear a helmet. For scooters and tricycles... I will not <br/>
force to wear helmet on them, although my 3 yo daughter just love to <br/>
put helmet on.:)</div>

to, so it&#39;s not theoretical.<br/>

smell?  The time it takes to put it on?  The feeling on his skin?  <br/>
There are lots of different products on the market.  Maybe you should <br/>
try some different ones to see which one he likes best.  For example, <br/>
we always buy the continuous spray bottle even though it&#39;s more <br/>
expensive.  It&#39;s quick and easy and doesn&#39;t involve rubbing into the <br/>
skin.<br/>

won&#39;t be able to stop in time?<br/>
<br/>
Are the two even in the same category of fear?<br/>
<br/>
My point isn&#39;t that parents shouldn&#39;t be safety conscious but that  <br/>
seeing the problem through fear colored glasses as though death were  <br/>
imminent -- like the Mack truck -- really muddies thinking. It makes  <br/>
it feel as though the only option is force and to turn it into a  <br/>
power struggle where mom&#39;s need to be right steamrollers over the  <br/>
child&#39;s feelings.<br/>
<br/>
If mom comes at the child with the attitude &quot;You must wear a helmet  <br/>
because you could die. That&#39;s just the way it is,&quot; when the child&#39;s  <br/>
real objection is that the helmet pinches or he can&#39;t see, then it  <br/>
whittles away at the relationship. If the parent isn&#39;t sympathetic to  <br/>
the child&#39;s point of view -- and not just &quot;Yeah, I know you don&#39;t  <br/>
like it but it&#39;s not safe without a helmet,&quot; -- then why should the  <br/>
child be sympathetic to the mom&#39;s? She&#39;s not modeling what she wants  <br/>
in return. (To complicate matters, often kids don&#39;t know what  <br/>
specifically they dislike when they say &quot;I hate that!&quot; It takes  <br/>
patience. It takes compassion to help them help you.)<br/>
<br/>
And regardless of what words a mom uses, when she imposes her way,  <br/>
the kid feels what she&#39;s really saying is &quot;You&#39;re not competent to  <br/>
work this out. I need to make the choice for you.&quot; For lots of kids  <br/>
that&#39;s a challenge to them and they&#39;ll be determined to show mom  <br/>
she&#39;s wrong, quite often by showing mom that her *fears* are wrong  <br/>
with &quot;Hey, mom, look I rode my bike today without a helmet and I  <br/>
didn&#39;t die! Ha! And I&#39;m going to keep doing that until you admit  <br/>
you&#39;re wrong!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Much better -- as a solution and as a model of handling opposing  <br/>
points of view -- to approach it with an attitude of &quot;Let&#39;s find a  <br/>
way that works for both of us.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If the child wasn&#39;t sympathetic to where the mom was coming from, I  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be opposed to dropping two melons on the pavement, one with  <br/>
and one without a helmet wrapped around it. Be prepared for the child  <br/>
to think it&#39;s cool ;-) But that doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t see the point.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s more helpful to work toward the goal of the child grasping why  <br/>
you would be concerned, than work towards getting the child to be  <br/>
concerned, if you see the difference. If we retain ownership of the  <br/>
fear as &quot;our thing&quot; the child is more likely to cooperate to help us  <br/>
than if we&#39;re trying to impose our fear on them in order to make them  <br/>
come around to our way of thinking.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1944715368">I think helmets are a great safety device but they don&#39;t always keep you<br/>
from getting killed or brain injured.  They&#39;re a cushion for certain kinds<br/>
of head impact.<br/>
<br/>
Helmets are not meant to protect beyond falls onto the pavement, the ground<br/>
and into objects like trees .. and even there speed makes a difference.  If<br/>
the rate of speed is high enough (and it doesn&#39;t take much speed in a car)<br/>
then a helmet might not prevent injury.<br/>
<br/>
A car is so much heavier that, depending on rate of speed and point of<br/>
impact, the body doesn&#39;t stand much chance.  Those elbow and knee pads are<br/>
just for falling down not collisions with cars.<br/>
<br/>
Point being, cars are not much of a helmet issue.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1449539783">There&#39;s nothing wrong with wearing a helmet, even if it&#39;s not a total<br/>
solution for all safety issues.  When I was a kid I rode all over our<br/>
property without one.  I was slow and careful on a bike because I&#39;m not that<br/>
physically talented at zipping.  I never learned to get around on roller<br/>
skates the way I&#39;d always dreamed of.<br/>
<br/>
I think Joyce&#39;s comments about listening to our kid&#39;s needs for comfortable<br/>
helmets that aren&#39;t completely against their style preferences is one<br/>
unschooling answer to dealing with a child&#39;s objection to a helmet.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s a matter of forced consumption in the opinion of some parents but<br/>
not in the opinion of the policeman who gives a citation or the neighbor who<br/>
calls in to child protection, maybe a kid wouldn&#39;t want that.  My dad is<br/>
something of a nonconformist and I sometimes wished the ground would open up<br/>
and swallow us all so that I didn&#39;t end up enduring embarrassment from that<br/>
kind of belligerence.<br/>
<br/>
Or if a curiosity develops in our children since the neighbor kid wears a<br/>
really snazzy looking helmet... then whether or not to buy a helmet becomes<br/>
a different matter.  Do we want to deny our kid to experience something so<br/>
simple because we have a big ideal we&#39;re upholding?  To relax a bit around<br/>
the issue, make it about ourselves.  If it&#39;s about ourselves and our *own*<br/>
ideals, our kids could still have a helmet while we ourselves ride bikes<br/>
sans helmet in order to satisfy our needs to be nonconformists.<br/>
<br/>
It could also end up being an area which touches on our children&#39;s freedom<br/>
to form and express their own unique opinions in their own home.  It&#39;s<br/>
possible to be a nonconformist to such a degree that it swallows up our<br/>
children&#39;s ability to express themselves until they leave home.  And in<br/>
unschooling that may mean that another area of force and coercion has opened<br/>
up for review.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-142470047">Dr. Mercola discusses the risk benefit of sunscreens and sun  <br/>
exposure.  It&#39;s the most balanced reading I&#39;ve done on the subject.   <br/>
He recommends it only in certain situations.  You can read about it  <br/>
here.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://products.mercola.com/summer%2Dsurvival%2Dkit/">http://products.mercola.com/summer%2Dsurvival%2Dkit/</a><br/>
<br/>
My dh grew up in New Zealand.  His family is from Ireland and the UK  <br/>
as are many from NZ.  Big diff in sun exposure.    He&#39;s had skin  <br/>
cancers so this is a subject I&#39;ve read up on.  Asher doesn&#39;t have  <br/>
quite as light skin as dh does but it&#39;s pretty light.<br/>
<br/>
We talk about not being in direct sun for long periods. If he is, we  <br/>
put Dr. Mercola&#39;s sunscreen on which I wish I had found long ago.  I  <br/>
would never put drugstore sunscreens on.   We&#39;ve talked lots about  <br/>
it.  I don&#39;t force it.  We&#39;ve tried different things like roll ons  <br/>
which he liked for a while.  He&#39;s had a sunburn and sees it&#39;s no  <br/>
fun.  It&#39;s trial and error like so much but getting into rules and  <br/>
coercion erodes the trust.  So it&#39;s not, you must do this, it&#39;s how  <br/>
can we do it so it&#39;s comfortable when necessary.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ultimately, what I think is less important than how I handle <br/>
disagreements with my kids over what constitues &quot;safe.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My 7yo is pretty sanguine about wearing a bike helmet. I say &quot;oh, <br/>
let me get your helmet&quot; and she puts it on. She climbs trees without <br/>
any kind of protective gear, though, and I personally know as many <br/>
people who&#39;ve been injured falling out of trees as riding bikes - <br/>
and with worse injuries on the tree side. We talk about trees and <br/>
climbing and tell each other stories - share information. <br/>
<br/>
My stepson, Ray, sometimes wears a helmet (on his bike or <br/>
skateboard) sometimes not. He makes his own decision based on how <br/>
dangerous he believes his fun is going to get. If he&#39;s &quot;dropping in <br/>
to carve&quot; he always wears a helmet. If he&#39;s just skating in a <br/>
parking lot - no. <br/>
<br/>
Why do I &quot;let&quot; him? I don&#39;t have any illusions that I can stop my <br/>
kids from doing things *I* think are dangerous if they want to do <br/>
them. Maybe I can stop them from doing one specific thing (take the <br/>
bikes and skateboard away) but my kids are clever. They can find <br/>
plenty of &quot;exciting&quot; things to do out here in the woods. Heck, there <br/>
are always trees!<br/>
<br/>
So the practical application really is the matter of sharing <br/>
information in a non-judgemental manner and being my kids&#39; ally in <br/>
terms of problem solving. *That* will have a higher chance <br/>
of &quot;keeping them safe&quot; than making any kind of statement about what <br/>
they should or should not do.<br/>
