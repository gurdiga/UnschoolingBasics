<div id="ygrps-yiv-1761412023">***** If she asks for instructions - give it to her BUT allow her to <br/>
stop the instructions whenever she chooses. Then it&#39;s unschooling. <br/>
Forcing is anti-learning imo.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m sorry I just keep reading this and have this image of little Junior<br/>
coming up to Mama.<br/>
&quot;I say Mater, I feel an inadequacy in my abilities. Will you vouchsafe to<br/>
afford me some instruction in this area?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The serious answer for me is &quot;yes the forcing is the key issue to be<br/>
avoided. Also manipulating, judging and negating&quot;. However one of the<br/>
problems with the concept of lessons is the idea that you have to start at<br/>
the beginning, work through, and then reach the end, and presto you have<br/>
learnt something. Natural learning happens more like jumping around a web<br/>
than zooming down one fixed highway. (Brief periods may be spent on the<br/>
highway, but the &quot;exits&quot; are limitless)<br/>
<br/>
I think most children who are unschooling sometimes ask for help with<br/>
specific tasks, and often want to enroll in classes in something outside of<br/>
the home like dance, sports or music. What keeps it unschooling is the<br/>
absolute freedom to give these up at will when the child has learnt enough<br/>
for themselves, or if they discover that it is not what they want after all.<br/>
<br/>
If a child is asking for &quot;instruction&quot; in the way I&#39;m guessing you mean it<br/>
(I may be wrong) - a kind of sequential program to learn something, it may<br/>
be that they are still DE-schooling. They have not yet rediscovered that<br/>
they can trust themselves and their own abilities to learn. They have been<br/>
damaged by the school system, but they will heal. In that situation, I would<br/>
suggest acclaiming the idea of &quot;it&#39;s still vacation! Yay&quot; And then strewing<br/>
lots of interesting things about.<br/>
<br/>
Or:<br/>
<br/>
If they are coming up with &quot;I need you to teach me how to read&quot;, it may be<br/>
that first they need a safe place to express some frustration, and then some<br/>
ideas from you then and there. I would avoid taking that as a blanket<br/>
request for instituting a whole reading program - unless you find some that<br/>
your kid is loving - in which case the same thinking applies as to the<br/>
outside classes: freedom to quit at any time without rancour.<br/>
