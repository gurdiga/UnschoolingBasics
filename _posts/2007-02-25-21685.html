<div id="ygrps-yiv-1199505409">I am an unschooler at heart and had unschooled for 3 years, then this<br/>
year we tried a mix, with me providing a very small amount of<br/>
instuction, that leaves probably 95% of our days for us to &#39;unschool.&#39; I<br/>
have in some ways been happier with this mix, and some ways not. I have<br/>
several questions regarding our approach. I can&#39;t figure out how to ask<br/>
them succinctly.  For example, reading late (by common standards) then<br/>
reading well runs in my family. So after reading many homeschooling and<br/>
unschooling books, when I found my daughter had no real interest in<br/>
reading, I did not worry. She is amazing and she will learn to read and<br/>
probably very well. But now for the problems. Part of our problem is<br/>
that the 3 kids have to go to a sitter for the 5 or 6 24-hour shifts I<br/>
work per month. I am the only support and this is unavoidable, and gives<br/>
many more days at home than most working parents have,  Our sitting<br/>
family is loving and wonderful but quite different than we are. Their 4<br/>
boys are homeschooled by a strict curriculum. They start early (not<br/>
later that 5 yrs old). Now those kids, despite their mothers&#39; support<br/>
(at least to my face) harrass my kids with comparisons, which of course<br/>
hurt. Furthermore, last summer my ex husband ask to visit the kids at<br/>
his far-away home for the first time in 3 years. He was the original<br/>
proponent of homeschooling in our family, but now is engaged to an<br/>
&#39;early child educator.&#39; He and she have decided maybe Em is dyslexic<br/>
(plus other educator-jargon labels).  Now of course you aren&#39;t going to<br/>
know how to work with an ex-spouse and that&#39;s not my question.  These<br/>
people and others have undermined Em&#39;s confidence. She has said that<br/>
it&#39;s my fault she isn&#39;t reading already.  Of course this pressure has<br/>
nothing to do with her readiness but has hurt her feelings and her faith<br/>
in me. So she asked me to work on her reading with her, and for a while<br/>
it seemed she enjoyed it and felt confident and ready. Now she doesn&#39;t<br/>
want to do it, and I have quietly let it be. But she still expresses the<br/>
opinion that I should have &#39;made her do it&#39; earlier, though now she<br/>
wouldn&#39;t want that, and she didn&#39;t then.  In summary, how do you let<br/>
them go if they hold you responsible for the outcome? What do I do about<br/>
outside pressures/comparisons? We have to spend time with so many people<br/>
who do that. I am mystified how so often people can compliment me on the<br/>
kids&#39; kindness, nonjudgementalness,and creativity, while still<br/>
criticizing their (apparent) lack of academic pursuits. It&#39;s a basic<br/>
tenet of our family that we are all imperfect, fallible, amazing<br/>
treasures. But they are very young to have the wisdom to   carry them<br/>
through criticism by family and close friends.   Next question: how can<br/>
kids explore the universe without some exposure to what&#39;s out there?   I<br/>
read widely, involve myself in their interests and share mine with them.<br/>
I remember when I was mulling over possible careers at age 20, one<br/>
limiting factor was my actual lack of knowlege of possible careers. You<br/>
can&#39;t pursue something you don&#39;t know exists. I do invite the kids to<br/>
the library, bookstores, etc.  I must admit, too, that I feel there are<br/>
certain books that are so important to read before growing up that I<br/>
must require they be read. Wha do I do with that?? And one more: my<br/>
oldest son has often spent so many consecutive days at the<br/>
TV/computer/video games that he barely eats or talks or sleeps.  The<br/>
more he does it the farther away he seems. This isn&#39;t one of those &quot;if I<br/>
let him&quot; things. He had freedom to choose and did this for months at a<br/>
time.  I was a very daydreamy child and I think I recognize his<br/>
behavior.  But how can he know what else might interest him if he does<br/>
so much of any one thing? Thanks. Please accept my apologies if my<br/>
questions seem confusing or too long.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-869520463">Thanks for your thoughtful reply. I sure agree with what you have said. Emily is aware that many children read later and that I am not concerned. However, she comes under pressures from other sources and I think this is the problem. I know that many unschoolers come under these pressures, and to an extent we must tolerate them and help the children see that we are confident in our lifestyles, ourselves, and them. It&#39;s just rather wearing in practice at times.  I am a single parent who manages to homeschool because I work 5 or 6 24 hour shifts a month and am home the rest of the time.     <br/>
 As to my question about the books I see as important: I already read books to the 3 kids daily. We love this. But there is a 5 year spread and some books I want my 13 yr old to be exposed to are not appropriate for the 7 and 10 yr olds.  I can not say they are all beloved by me. Some are downright painful (and some of these will wait for more maturity) such as Hiroshima, etc. But some books that are hard to read are very important.    I think the issues behind these two questions are deep philosophical issues, and the details may just distract from the real questions.                                                                                           from                                                                                                                                   ---- Original Message ----<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1945614334">I am actually very tuned in to learning where a person is, and not forcing my ideas on people. I don&#39;t think that works anyway. My kids know me well enough, I think, to understand that I want them to understand why I believe what I believe, and that whatever they believe, I will love them and try to understand.  Two days ago my 7 yo son showed me that one night when he was mad, he hammered a metal fixture in the bathroom flat. I told him I was aware he was very angry that night, and thanked him for trusting me to care how he felt rather than be angry. He replied, &quot;I&#39;d trust you with anything.&quot; I felt really happy about that (and happy he didn&#39;t hit the hot water pipe 2 millimeters to the right). I guess for the most part I teach the kids that all humans are fallible, and to avoid anyone who claims that they are the oracle of truth.  Having said that, I do teach that there are some absolute wrong things in life. Not many, but some, and that one is killing. And they have<br/>
 already frequently chosen not to read what I recommend, although they sometimes do.  I will have to think about this some more.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
But even that is not an absolute.<br/>

<br/>
I think one of the hardest things for people with really strong <br/>
feelings about certain subjects is the idea that those we <br/>
love---especially our children!---will have different views.<br/>
<br/>
A deeply religious person may feel that he&#39;s losing his child forever <br/>
(eternally even) if the child leaves the church.<br/>
It would hurt me if my boys decided not to unschool their kids.<br/>
What if your child decided to join the army?<br/>
<br/>
We have to realize that our children have their own lives, their own <br/>
ideas and ideals, and their own thoughts and needs. It can be really <br/>
hard when their values don&#39;t mesh wih ours. But accepting that is <br/>
hugely important! Terrifically hard, but really, really important.<br/>

<br/>
If killing is an absolute wrong, then it makes nature rather hard to<br/>
understand where it&#39;s kill or be killed every day.<br/>
<br/>
It makes it hard to know when killing is right to other people....like<br/>
when someone wants help dying because they are terminal and don&#39;t want<br/>
to suffer. Or when a person defends themselves, or their children from<br/>
some person that wants to do them harm.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found there aren&#39;t many absolutes in my world. I want my children<br/>
to ponder many angles without the weight of my views and judgement<br/>
upon them, thought they do know how I feel about certain topics.<br/>

Having said that, I do teach that there are some absolute wrong things <br/>
in life. Not many, but some, and<br/>
that one is killing<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
But even that is not an absolute.<br/>
<br/>
We can all imagine a scenario in which we *could* kill (or at least use <br/>
deadly force) to save ourselves or our children.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
And they have already frequently chosen not to read what I recommend, <br/>
although they sometimes<br/>
do. I will have to think about this some more.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
I think one of the hardest things for people with really strong <br/>
feelings about certain subjects is the idea that those we <br/>
love---especially our children!--- will have different views.<br/>
<br/>
A deeply religious person may feel that he&#39;s losing his child forever <br/>
(eternally even) if the child leaves the church.<br/>
It would hurt me if my boys decided not to unschool their kids.<br/>
What if your child decided to join the army?<br/>
<br/>
We have to realize that our children have their own lives, their own <br/>
ideas and ideals, and their own thoughts and needs. It can be really <br/>
hard when their values don&#39;t mesh wih ours. But accepting that is <br/>
hugely important! Terrifically hard, but really, really important.<br/>

    What would happen if one of my kids joined the army, or killed <br/>
someone, I would<br/>
grieve, and they would know it because we have that kind of honesty <br/>
between us.<br/>
But I would never withdraw my love and support, and I think they know <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Even with love and support, a parent&#39;s disappointment is hard to live <br/>
with.<br/>
<br/>
And keep in mind that joining the service does NOT mean the child will <br/>
ever have to kill. Nor does it mean he&#39;s aggressive or violent.<br/>
<br/>
All the military men and women I know want PEACE (I do know there are <br/>
exceptions to that---but not among the *many* folks I know). Just <br/>
because they *will*  lay down their lives for you doesn&#39;t mean they <br/>
*want* to!<br/>
