<div id="ygrps-yiv-923650810">The movie Wayne&#39;s World has some of my favorite product placement. They very <br/>
openly advertise a bunch of different things in a lump while talking about <br/>
how the local t.v. access channel Wayne&#39;s World isn&#39;t willing to sell out to <br/>
advertise a video game arcade. They do it in the second movie as well, but <br/>
not as much. We watched Men in Black last night and there is a scene where <br/>
these little aliens are leaving and they are pulling a bunch of Marlboro <br/>
cigarettes with them. Everybody noticed the product placement.<br/>
<br/>
We talk alot about what&#39;s on television, and sometimes that means talking <br/>
about television as an ad. But really that&#39;s not what keeps Simon and <br/>
Linnaea from succumbing to &quot;predatory&quot; advertisement. It&#39;s having a full and <br/>
rich and happy life that doesn&#39;t leave them feeling needy or unfulfilled. <br/>
The reason why television ads work, or why children can be lured away by <br/>
sexual predators on the internet, is because they are offering some image of <br/>
life, of happiness, that the child is unable to fulfill in their own lives.<br/>

&gt; My point about tv is that it&#39;s ALL advertising -even the programmes.<br/>
&gt; We are the product that is being bought whether we buy a something or<br/>
&gt; not. It is like buying billboard space in our homes. They are buying<br/>
&gt; access to us. It is only because advertisers. product placers, and<br/>
&gt; corporations pay for tv that it even exists. You don&#39;t have to buy<br/>
&gt; their stuff to be the product, all you have to do is watch. </span></blockquote></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-190859220">I *love* Waynes World!  I&#39;ve owned fewer than ten movies in my life (not counting my kids&#39; <br/>
movies), and Waynes World 1 and 2 are among them!!!<br/>
<br/>
Reminds me....maybe one day this week, instead of being on the computer until the wee <br/>
hours, I&#39;ll watch my old friends!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the blast from the past,<br/>
