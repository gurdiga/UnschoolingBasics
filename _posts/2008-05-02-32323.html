<div id="ygrps-yiv-424472362">Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
It is that time of year in my part of the world, when parents sign <br/>
their children up for sports teams, summer clubs, etc.  My 6 year old <br/>
son has no interest in joining anything.  It doesn&#39;t bother me that <br/>
he doesn&#39;t want a sports team....but it does bother me how people <br/>
seem to expect us to sign DS up for &quot;something&quot;.  In fact, I&#39;m <br/>
starting to feel a slight anxiety about this now!  Is he missing <br/>
out?  What exactly is he missing out on??  I&#39;m definately not <br/>
comfortable with coersing him into joining something.  I might add <br/>
that we are the only ones in our neighbourhood who are unschoolers <br/>
(and homeschoolers too I&#39;m sure).  I guess I&#39;m just feeling the <br/>
pressure of all my conventional neighbours.<br/>
<br/>
DS loves being outside, exploring nature and working in our gardens.  <br/>
He is really in his element doing those things.  At my mom&#39;s we&#39;re <br/>
putting a massive veggie garden in and in the evenings, DS wants to <br/>
help me plant and reap.  If he sees a bush that needs deadheading, <br/>
he&#39;ll just dig in and do it.  This is one of his loves.  <br/>
<br/>
He also LOVES tinkering with tools and wood.  He wants to build our <br/>
dog a house. He also helped build our deck last week.  <br/>
<br/>
These are his summer activities as well as our camping trips.  His <br/>
loves....<br/>
<br/>
Any opinions out there?  Will the lack of team experience in his <br/>
young years have horrible results later in life?  ( I ask that tongue-<br/>
in-cheek, but this is the thinking in my part of the world.)<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-438187264">Mel -<br/>
<br/>
I have an opinion for you from a parent on the other side of the<br/>
spectrum.  I have three children.  I have always homeschooled, more<br/>
recently committed to an unschooling style.  My husband and I were<br/>
both gymnasts, we teach gymnastics, we live athletically, and our<br/>
children have taken to enjoying the sport.  My oldest two are on<br/>
gymnastics teams.  <br/>
<br/>
In their earlier years, they were content with a class or two here and<br/>
there.  As they grew, they sought out friendships and peers who were<br/>
interested in their own interests.  It happened to be gymnastics.  I<br/>
feel that they have led me to this position.  Though I want them to<br/>
feel a certain responsibility to their team, I do not wish for them to<br/>
continue if it does not fulfill their wants or needs any longer.  <br/>
<br/>
It is easy to fall into the trap of wanting to do what *everyone* else<br/>
thinks you should do.  In my experience, my children spent their<br/>
younger years clinging to my interests and looking for ways to connect<br/>
with me.  As they got to be 6-8 years old (depending on the child...<br/>
so far in my experience), they started to lead me in different<br/>
directions of their interests.  I became a follower.  A supporter. <br/>
Their biggest fan.  <br/>
<br/>
If you are feeling pressure, take a step back, ask yourself why you or<br/>
he have chosen the activities that you have, and check in with your<br/>
instinct.  Are you doing what is right for your boy at this time? <br/>
Children change interests and needs rapidly.  Spend your time in the<br/>
now.  Offer the world to your child, but be prepared for him to want<br/>
nothing to do with it till he&#39;s found his own direction.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s totally okay to not be involved teams, clubs, sports, etc.  It&#39;s<br/>
your job to show him many paths, it&#39;s his choice to step on that path<br/>
or not.  <br/>
<br/>
Take a deep breath and do what you feel is right.<br/>

<br/>
If he were clamoring for team sports, I&#39;d say sign him up. But he&#39;s  <br/>
not. Let him be.<br/>
<br/>
He may want to be a team sport player in the future. Then you can  <br/>
revisit it. He also may never want to do it. That&#39;s okay, too. It&#39;s  <br/>
better that he be confident and secure in his own self, in his own  <br/>
passions, regardless of what other families do. Support him in this.<br/>
<br/>
My dd, now 13, was never interested in team sports. Tennis, yes.  <br/>
Gymnastics, yes. Horseback riding, yes. But soccer or any other team  <br/>
sport? Nope. And I&#39;ve offered throughout the years, but it wasn&#39;t  <br/>
something that interested her. A friend of hers might be doing a  <br/>
soccer skills camp this summer and dd thought she might want to do it,  <br/>
too, but only because her friend is doing it. Otherwise, it&#39;s not on  <br/>
her radar.<br/>
<br/>
That isn&#39;t to say she&#39;s never done group things. She performed in a  <br/>
homeschool Shakespearean troupe (she enjoyed it very much at the time,  <br/>
but once was enough for her). She currently belongs to a teen group  <br/>
which gets together for various activities, but team sports are really  <br/>
not her style. Not now, in any case.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder how many of those kids whose parents signed them up for team  <br/>
anything really wanted to do those things....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1276065692">ITA with what you&#39;ve seen so far.  Some kids (just like some adults!)<br/>
are just not into team sports, or even *any* sports.  I like the<br/>
suggestion below wrt celebrating his individual passions.  I<br/>
constantly have to do that wrt my twins, whom people love to compare<br/>
because they are the same age.  grrrr.  <br/>
<br/>
(On a side note, my daughters are interested in several summer camp<br/>
activities, because they see it as an opportunity to try on an<br/>
activity as a possibility for the future, without having to make a<br/>
long-term commitment.  But they are only signing up for what interests<br/>
them, and in fact I am finding that I have to rein things in a bit for<br/>
costs.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1983371839">Hi,<br/>
I have a six year old son as well who is outside in the yard with me and his little brother for most days that are nice. He tried soccer a year ago and only liked it because there were some nice girls he said. He did not go back and has not asked to do any kind of team sport since. The only things he does like that are somewhat sporty are mini-golf and climbing rocks and sometimes playing ball and swordfighting -<br/>
There are only two other homeschoolers in our town that we do not have much contact with, but there are nice ones in the next towns over. I used to show him all the great classes that are being offered everywhere, and my DS tried a few, but this year HE wants to be the teacher and me and my other DS are taking his &#39;classes&#39; daily now. They are great fun too. <br/>
I truly believe that no classes are necessary - when someone gets to be a certain age and really feels that they want to learn something specific that no one else can teach them they will find the right mentor for themselves. <br/>
As long as he  does not beg to join a team sport and shows no interest in it, it is certainly not at all necessary. I personally never liked them and wish I had not been forced to do some in school. It taught me nothing, other than that I felt inadequate and awkward. But I do love to dance a lot and this is something I found out without any class at all -<br/>

Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
It is that time of year in my part of the world, when parents sign <br/>
their children up for sports teams, summer clubs, etc.  My 6 year old <br/>
son has no interest in joining anything.  It doesn&#39;t bother me that <br/>

comfortable with coersing him into joining something.  I might add <br/>
that we are the only ones in our neighbourhood who are unschoolers <br/>
(and homeschoolers too I&#39;m sure).  I guess I&#39;m just feeling the <br/>
pressure of all my conventional neighbours.<br/>
<br/>
DS loves being outside, exploring nature and working in our gardens. <br/>
He is really in his element doing those things.  At my mom&#39;s we&#39;re <br/>

<br/>
I totally agree with this.  My 5 year old daughter&#39;s friends are all<br/>
taking classes signed up for all sorts of things(incidentally their<br/>
parents are going through their own issues of paying for all this<br/>
stuff when their kids are only sort of involved/interested...).  My<br/>
daughter has no interest-I&#39;ve asked.  Her opinion is she can&#39;t do what<br/>
she wants when she&#39;s there so she doesn&#39;t want to do it.<br/>
<br/>
 I think she is learning something valuable-that a lot of what you<br/>
want to learn you can learn on your own(takes out that teacher as<br/>
superior type of thinking). And as Mara said when you feel like you<br/>
want to know more you can find the right mentor.<br/>
<br/>
I also feel not taking lessons being part of a club or team gives a<br/>
kid a chance to develop their own style.  For example if you start out<br/>
with dance lessons before you have danced on your own with your heart<br/>
full of bliss how will you know what is your style?  I can tell you my<br/>
3 year old has a dance no one could&#39;ve taught her and it is my<br/>
favorite-but more importantly hers, too.<br/>
