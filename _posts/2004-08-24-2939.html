<div id="ygrps-yiv-1930811423">&quot;Although I work with my<br/>
kids and compromise and negotiate, I AM still the mom, and there ARE <br/>
times when<br/>
we ALL have to do something, whether we want to or not. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Like what?<br/>
I&#39;m being serious here...there is nothing in my life that I don&#39;t <br/>
CHOOSE to do. There are plenty of things that aren&#39;t my favorite <br/>
activities, but I choose them because I like the activity better <br/>
than the consequence. There is still choice involved.<br/>
I doubt the child that was &quot;dawdling&quot; (probably not wanting to go <br/>
somewhere he was forced to go) really chose to go to school in <br/>
pj&#39;s. &quot;Natural consequences&quot; is really just punishment in disguise.<br/>
True natural consequences happen all on their own. The natural <br/>
consequence of not eating is being hungry. The  natural consequence <br/>
of my spending too much money is I&#39;ll have less.<br/>
Making a child go to school in pajamas is more about the parent <br/>
making a point in my opinion. <br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m not here to find fault with your choices...truly.<br/>
I was simply pointing out that it wasn&#39;t a good example of how <br/>
unschooling works, or how we use unschooling philosophies to assist <br/>
our parenting choices.<br/>
A criticism of information is not a criticism of you as a parent.<br/>
<br/>
If someone is using a school example to explain unschooling <br/>
philosophies, I&#39;m going to question that at my list. <br/>
<br/>
Keeping my child safe from impending danger IS my job as a mother. <br/>
That does not mean I use &quot;natural consequences&quot; to try and teach <br/>
them a lesson. Real life consequences will happen. But my children <br/>
trust me to help them when they need to get ready, to not force them <br/>
to do things they don&#39;t want to do and to keep them healthy and safe.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever your choices were in the past, or whatever your parenting <br/>
situation, I believe you (just as myself) did the best you could at <br/>
the time. That doesn&#39;t mean we did great, we just did our best.<br/>
Hopefully our best keeps getting better.<br/>
I can certainly look back and see where I made tremendous mistakes.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that at an unschooling list, we could admit that sending a <br/>
child anywhere in clothing they didn&#39;t want to be seen in, is not <br/>
the most respectful choice.<br/>
