<div id="ygrps-yiv-1648905008">It&#39;s great that you want to explore unschooling. Have you started reading<br/>
and getting an understanding of what unschooling is?<br/>
<br/>
I like Swiss Army Wife&#39;s definition<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.swissarmywife.net/category/unschool/">http://www.swissarmywife.net/category/unschool/</a><br/>
She also has a wealth of exceptional writing pertaining to unschooling and<br/>
living respectfully with children. She comes from the perspective of having<br/>
her oldest in school and being a more mainstream parent. Very similar to<br/>
where you may be on your journey.<br/>
<br/>
There are a treasure trove of unschooling resources on the web now. This<br/>
website has a nice list of resources to try.<br/>

<br/>
We have always unschooled, however I know many people who have come into<br/>
unschooling from a school perspective. It is my understanding that it really<br/>
helps if the parents deschool themselves as much as possible before leaping<br/>
in with two feet :-)<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of de-schooling most people recommend relaxing a lot when a kid<br/>
comes out of school. Giving them space to switch gears and heal from the<br/>
experience. This may take months or even years. A common way to describe<br/>
this is to treat it like a wonderful vacation. No agendas or pushing. Just<br/>
have fun and support whatever your child is into at the moment.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-199242227">Talk to the K12 people to find out the withdrawal procedure. Then research whether you want to register your Home Education Program with your county (letter of intent, etc.) OR enroll your children in a private/umbrella school.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2135038333">Hi Kevin<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If they are considered enrolled in school (which is what most K12<br/>
programs are - it&#39;s public school in your house), you need to do<br/>
whatever procedure is required legally in your state to remove them from<br/>
the roll book. That varies from state to state, so you&#39;d be better<br/>
served in asking on a FL local list, rather than an international list<br/>
like this one. Legally, unschooling IS homeschooling, so you&#39;d need to<br/>
do whatever is legally required in your state - each state&#39;s laws are<br/>
different, which you already know if you&#39;re homeschooling. I do know<br/>
that in FL there are a couple options to homeschooling laws - you can go<br/>
through the local school district or you can use an umbrella. Umbrellas<br/>
vary in what they require (and I&#39;d suggest checking them out to make<br/>
sure the umbrella doesn&#39;t require MORE than the school district does).<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
One that is done, unschooling is like being on permanent vacation. Your<br/>
job moves from being the driving force to being a partner and resource<br/>
for their exploration. You move from the driver&#39;s seat to the shot gun<br/>
seat - they set the direction, you help them reach that goal (you&#39;ve got<br/>
the access to resources they don&#39;t have - car keys, checking account,<br/>
etc). it&#39;s a lot more like when they were toddlers, before school age,<br/>
when you all explored the world together.<br/>
<br/>
