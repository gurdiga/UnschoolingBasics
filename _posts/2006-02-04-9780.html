<div id="ygrps-yiv-1639962488">The following is from a book I am reading called French <br/>
Impressions.  It just warmed my heart and I am sure it will yours <br/>
too!  I am sorry for the length, it was just SO good!!<br/>
<br/>
This woman was feeling very overwhelmed by all the chores and her <br/>
children so her husband hired a helper for her.  The kids were doing <br/>
so well while in her care that she wondered what this other lady was <br/>
doing right..................<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Then, using my newfound skulking and lurking skills, I <br/>
began coming home unexpectedly sneaking in the door, and giving John <br/>
[the oldest sone] the third degree.  And suddenly a whole world of <br/>
child psychology opened up before me.<br/>
<br/>
How did she keep Stephen from his favorite tricks of turning on the <br/>
gas stove, eating or destroying anything within reach, teetering <br/>
from high places, and breaking bottles?  Elise told him not to, as I <br/>
did , but when he continued, she didn&#39;t spank or scold him.  She <br/>
picked him up, hugged him, and hugged him, and smothered him with <br/>
kisses.  She told him he was a perfect treasure, a little chicken, a <br/>
little cabbage, and that she loved him.  Then she set him down <br/>
again, and as John declared, &quot;It really works!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And work it did.  Before my disbelieving eyes, Elise was actually <br/>
loving him out of being disobedient.  She sang songs to him about <br/>
himself and told him stories in which he always turned out to be the <br/>
central character.<br/>
<br/>
From the time she arrived until she sang him to sleep at night, a <br/>
stream of flattery, praise, and affection poured over him.  No <br/>
matter how naughty the act (and there were many), no matter how <br/>
obstinate he grew, or how violent his temper tantrums, Elise would <br/>
brush back her salt-and-pepper hair, twinkle at him with her dark <br/>
eyes, and maintain an iron calm.<br/>
<br/>
As I got to know her better, I learned of her past life and wondered <br/>
at her happy nature.  She had lived through two world wars in <br/>
embattled France, and her life had been hard and joyless.  But her <br/>
cheerful nature dismissed these hardships.  She summed up the bad <br/>
years with &quot;It&#39;s finished now.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And that was her attitude toward the children&#39;s misdeeds.  Once it <br/>
was over, &quot;it was finished,&quot; and she would smile at the funny things <br/>
they did next.  She constantly showed them things to be happy about <br/>
and divided her attentions equally when she was with both boys and <br/>
taught them to respect and love each other.  <br/>
<br/>
She talked always of the boys&#39; best characteristics and ignored <br/>
their bad ones.  When I explained to her that I had not been able to <br/>
train Stephen to stay dry during the day, she looked surprised.  Not <br/>
at him, but at me.<br/>
<br/>
Toilet training is not something southern French parents thing much <br/>
about.  Their superior, if unhygienic, method is not to put pants on <br/>
kids until they have reached an age when they can &quot;inidicate what is <br/>
desired.&quot;  ..........................................................<br/>
..............................<br/>
<br/>
When Stephen was in my care, I adopted Elise&#39;s tactics and found <br/>
that they worked, even for me.  The Mr.Hyde in him receded to a <br/>
manageable degree, and wonder of wonders, he began to sleep through <br/>
the night occasionally.<br/>
.....................................................................<br/>
.....................<br/>
<br/>
For what I had left out of my calculations on child rearing was a <br/>
prime ingredient-not just love but absolute and unqualified love.  <br/>
Sure, it takes common sense and luck to raise a child, but Elise <br/>
taught me the greatest lesson of all.  No child can long withstand <br/>
the furious and unstoppable onslaught of The Love Treatment.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1178104060">Awe, who cares about the length Heidi, it certainly did warm my heart too!<br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone could argue with any of Elise&#39;s tactics could they! <br/>
Thanks for sharing it with us, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I wonder what the world <br/>
would be like today if everyone had an upbringing like that. Made me want to go <br/>
out and find the book!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-889384764">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Is this a fiction or non-fiction book?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It is a story written about a family that lived in France for one year <br/>
back in the 1950&#39;s, which makes that excerpt even more remarkable.  <br/>
The story was written by the little boy in the book, John Littell.  He <br/>
wrote the book from his mother&#39;s journals so it is a true story but I <br/>
am sure he has added a bit here and there based on what he thought his <br/>
mom was feeling or talking about.  It was written from his mother&#39;s <br/>
perspective.  It is a really good book and there is quite a bit of <br/>
humor in it.  Again, it is called &quot;French Impressions&quot;.<br/>
