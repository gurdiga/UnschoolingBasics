<div id="ygrps-yiv-1651563622">Brooke wants to make an endangered animals website and have sections<br/>
for Zoos(she is an AVID Zoo Tycooner Gal :-)) she&#39;d like to have some<br/>
link to places that are active in saving animals too. Wondering if<br/>
anyone here as any children that have a website that she could link<br/>
hers too and possible an email so she can keep in contact with other<br/>
animal lovers.  Perhaps some could recommend reputable animal sites<br/>
that allow people to link from a site to their site?  I&#39;ll be actively<br/>
searching  today for this information but would love some<br/>
recommendations should anyone have any.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-754738385">Google Chase Pickering. I think it *may* be www.ChasePickering.com<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s not an unschooler. Should be though! &lt;g&gt; He&#39;s a photographer. <br/>
Amazing stuff!<br/>
