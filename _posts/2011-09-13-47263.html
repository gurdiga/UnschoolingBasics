<div id="ygrps-yiv-539492639">Only 8 days left for the Early Bird registration special for the 2012 5th Annual Unschoolers Waterpark Gathering in Sandusky, Ohio.  We already have participants from over 18 states!  Visit the website,  unschoolerswaterparkgathering.com for more info.  Early bird registration saves you money and gets you some cool perks from the Kalahari resort!  Also, suites with kitchens, which are really popular with larger families, go quickly so reserve yours now. <br/>

We hope to see you there!  <br/>
