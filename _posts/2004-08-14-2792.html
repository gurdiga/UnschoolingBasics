For me, after watching Laurie follow her own path for 18 <br/>
years, it was easy to be detached about her choices. I knew her well <br/>
enough to know that every decision she made would be right for her <br/>
at that time or she&#39;d merge into a new path if it wasn&#39;t. I really <br/>
had no expectations, other than for her to be happy. When she <br/>
started fretting in her late teens about what she was going to do <br/>
with the rest of her life, I explained to her that the restlessness <br/>
she was feeling was her body/mind/soul becoming aware of the need <br/>
for a change and b/m/s were all searching for what exactly that <br/>
change would be. <br/>
<br/>
I never had the nagging doubts. I loved it when her mind would hear <br/>
a new idea (to her) and she&#39;d immerse herself in learning about it. <br/>
She&#39;d know right where she stood on the idea and just how much of <br/>
the idea to adopt for herself. She often took it further than it had <br/>
been taken and get really involved. Hence her title as the Resident <br/>
Radical at college. She was on the news picketing places more than a <br/>
few times. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I took her decisions about what &quot;to do&quot; with her life seriously and <br/>
supported her in those decisions. Sometimes she stuck with them for <br/>
awhile and at other times she decided rather quickly that it wasn&#39;t <br/>
such a great choice for her. She always discusses her plans with me <br/>
and she always gets my support. That way she feels free to drop them <br/>
and not worry about mom getting all weird about it. She&#39;s watched me <br/>
change paths several times during her lifetime and she knows that <br/>
there are many paths to choose from that will be right for her at <br/>
different times in her life. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not content to stay in one place in my life for very long. I go <br/>
from one thing to the other, quitting when it&#39;s not right for me and <br/>
going on to something else...with no apologies. I enjoy my life and <br/>
I feel no guilt about not finishing the pottery class (for instance) <br/>
when it made my wrists hurt. My parents have belittled my choices as <br/>
far back as I can remember. I made a vow to never do that to Laurie. <br/>
***Thank you so much for this post, Valerie!  It is definitely a keeper!<br/>
