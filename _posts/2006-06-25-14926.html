<div id="ygrps-yiv-1437313751">hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
we have been long term lurkers on this list. We are homeschooling our 4yr old and <br/>
3month old. This is an appeal for any homeschoolers out there who want a sea change...<br/>
<br/>
we have recently moved from Melbourne to buy/ build in a new ecovillage in Currumbin <br/>
Valley Queensland. The web site is:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.theecovillage.com.au">http://www.theecovillage.com.au</a><br/>
<br/>
we have already met one lovely couple with an 18 month old who are buying in and share <br/>
our approach to natural learning etc.. so we thought that we would shamelessly put this <br/>
out into the world so we can connect with other like minds. <br/>
<br/>
If you have considered a sea change why not also check out this ecovillage. We would love <br/>
more homeschoolers here! Contact the ecovillage via their web site above for more info... <br/>
or contact us if you like. Before you ask NO we dont get commissions - we are just really <br/>
keen to have a vibrant homeschooling community here :)<br/>
<br/>
please feel free to pass this onto anyone you know who might be interested. Even if you <br/>
are a homeschooler around currumbin/ gold coast please do drop us a line.<br/>
<br/>
all the best,<br/>
anne & arun</div>
