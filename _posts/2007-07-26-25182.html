  And as with all things, mileage may vary.  My bil has been with FedEx for several years now, working in their tech-help center (where the delivery guys call in for tech support).  FedEx relocated them to Memphis rather abruptly 2 yrs ago, but other than that, my sis & bil have no complaints.  The pay is good, benefits are more generous than any job he&#39;s had -- certainly more than my dh has at his job.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I suspect that it&#39;s the nature of call centers to be a tough work environment -- or so I&#39;ve heard from virtually everyone who&#39;s ever done that kind of work.  <br/>

Well, perhaps so. Color me vapid, but I like to see real companies in a  <br/>
realistic type movie. Real people use those products, so why NOT use the real  <br/>
item? I guess to me, it&#39;s not a big deal. I guess actually that a truth for me,  <br/>
since I didn&#39;t even remember that it was Fed. Express, nor have I ever used <br/>

Yeah, but just WAIT! Next time you&#39;re at the store, you will walk past<br/>
the volleyballs and have this inexplicable urge to play volleyball<br/>
right NOW. You&#39;ll buy one, get home and sit there scratching your head<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I like advertising and I&#39;m always a little surprised when folks act <br/>
like advertising is the horrible monster creation of an evil, greedy <br/>
madman.<br/>
<br/>
Trees and plants that flower are advertising.  Flowers with sweet <br/>
fragrance are advertising.  Birds that gain colorful spring plumage <br/>
are advertising.  Plants that make bright tasty berries are <br/>
advertising.<br/>
<br/>
Humans have been advertising and responding to advertising since <br/>
long  before there were evil corporate plots to take over the world, <br/>
one dryer sheet at a time.  We have painted our hair and faces, <br/>
tattooed our bodies, pierced our parts and sucked in our guts since <br/>
the first hairy chick laid eyes on the Neanderthal of her dreams.  <br/>
We have made jewelry to adorn ourselves with and twirled up our hair <br/>
and grown spectacular mustaches (you should see mine!) since before <br/>
there was MTV or Vogue.  <br/>
  <br/>
We looked for animal tracks or droppings as a sign of potential <br/>
tasty dinner as surely as we look for a Subway sign today.  We <br/>
salivated over ripe fruit or a clutch of eggs or a juicy grasshopper <br/>
even before Olive Garden showed us fettuccini alfredo.   We respond <br/>
to advertising and always have.  It was in our best interest to do <br/>
so and still is.  Some people want to be scared (of anything) <br/>
because it makes them feel more alert and in a world where most of <br/>
us ( at least on this list) are pretty darn safe, I guess we create <br/>
our boogie men where we can.   <br/>
<br/>
I have indeed purchased items because I was impressed with the <br/>
advertising claims.  But like Joyce, I would not and have not <br/>
continued to purchase or use a product that I didn&#39;t like or that <br/>
didn&#39;t work the way I wanted it to work.    I&#39;m glad for advertising <br/>
because it lets me know which baking powders are aluminum free, <br/>
which lettuce is organic, which corn is non gmo and which laundry <br/>
soap smells like the old lady at the antique store. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m forty four years old and I&#39;ve seen lots of advertisements for <br/>
make up and nail polish and hair goo and I have not purchased makeup <br/>
or nail polish since I was thirteen.  I buy whatever shampoo is on <br/>
sale and is free of critter squeezin&#39;s (and I know because of <br/>
advertising) and I have a ninety nine cent bottle of something or <br/>
other in the shower right now.  I don&#39;t remember what brand I <br/>
bought, but I remember the price. <br/>
And I knew it was ninety nine cents because it was advertised.  I <br/>
have heard Mr. Clean will do wonders for my house and I still <br/>
scrubbed my tub with baking soda last night.  I have heard Pledge <br/>
will shine my piano but I still wiped it off with a dry dish towel.  <br/>
<br/>
There are things that can really hurt our kids.  Yelling, slapping, <br/>
spanking, yanking, shaming, pressure, coercion, meanness, neglect.  <br/>
There are real dangers in the world.  One real danger might be <br/>
feeling so helpless and weak minded so as to be at the mercy of <br/>
madmen, or, er, ad men.     ; )<br/>

I too have few issues with advertising. Some, yes. Usually, not really. <br/>

I&#39;d like to think on that. I&#39;m glad this came up.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;ve had many conversations with the kids over the years about advertising<br/>

(I want to say a month, but I don&#39;t think I could&#39;ve gone that long without<br/>
a coke!) only buying products we had *not* seen advertised on TV. It was fun<br/>
to explore the shelves at the grocer filled with products by companies we&#39;d<br/>
never ever heard of!! We had lots of talks about the things we love -- do we<br/>
love them because a commercial told us to or did we make up our own minds?<br/>
This was completely voluntary on all our parts and we did it just for the<br/>
fun of it. We&#39;ve also compared the cost of advertising on our grocery bill--<br/>
are the heaviest advertised products jacked up to pay for the commercials? A<br/>
fun project for my boy who loves all things related to cash!!<br/>
I also love grocery shopping and spewing advert pieces from my childhood --<br/>

What a totally cool idea! I love it! Now we shop at Trader Joe&#39;s and they  <br/>
sell few products I&#39;ve ever seen advertised, but when we hit Target, I may take  <br/>
that idea into account! <br/>
 <br/>
I am a child of the 70&#39;s..I remember those commercials and yes, love them!  <br/>
Not that *I* buy &quot;oleo&quot; either ;) <br/>

But I  know I&#39;ve never known a 4 year old who would spend hours of doing any <br/>
one  thing.  Especially playing a video game.  I can see them picking up  the <br/>
controller and checking it out, but hours? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I must say, Julian, who will be 5 in Sept. can and does spend HOURS at a  <br/>
time playing a game on Addictinggames.com that is called &quot;Territory Wars&quot; lol.  <br/>
However, this is how he does ALL things. He will spend hours upon hours  <br/>
watching, then hours upon hours playing...then he moves on to something else a  few <br/>
days/weeks later...and we start anew. <br/>
 <br/>
But he plays and sees some violence! But - ok, he loves Burn Out. The goal  <br/>
is to smash into as many cars as possible and cause major damage in accidents.  <br/>
But when we saw a REAL accident, he was full of concern for the people in the <br/>
 car (that was upside down) and was truly worried and upset that someone <br/>
could  get hurt. <br/>
 <br/>
I know he knows the difference. I talked to him and he also really seems to  <br/>
just KNOW. <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s interesting. And it&#39;s been a BIG part of my learning to trust him and  <br/>
the process, the experience. <br/>
 <br/>
The hours at a time have amazed me! <br/>

Well, cool!  The attention he can give something at 4! :)<br/>
<br/>
I do have a son who will do things for hours, but at 4,  I&#39;m not sure he would have or not.  We were in an entirely different place, as far as parenting, so he was never really able to.   I was just thinking about other 4 year olds I know and my daughter, (who have been radically unschooled) and they tend/tended to bounce around to different things at that age.  <br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s cool with unschooling is that he can do that.  Our kids are free to pursue what ever interests come to their mind.  Gotta love it.<br/>

Yup - it&#39;s the choice! He learns all things that way, and he is learning  <br/>
that he does also - recognizing it, actually :) He, with all things, will watch  <br/>
and watch and watch and watch...for months sometimes..and then suddenly - he  <br/>
DOES for hours and hours and hours, lol...then, on to something new :)<br/>
 <br/>
And yeah! Gotta love it! <br/>
