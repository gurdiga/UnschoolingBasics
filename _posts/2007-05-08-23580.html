<div id="ygrps-yiv-672547955">This comic was created by Jason Holm, a homeschooling dad, who&#39;s trying to start up a new business to support his family.  <br/>

<br/>
IMPORTANT NOTICE! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Due to numerous requests, I will be making this comic available for t-shirts and bumper stickers. If you are interested, please drop me a line and let me know the sizes and quantity you would like. There&#39;s no obligation for this pre-order ï¿½ it just gives me a chance to check with the printer on how much it will cost to produce them. I&#39;ll probably start with a black and white image on the front of a white t-shirt, as well as black and white bumper stickers. Let me know if you&#39;d be willing to pay extra for a color shirt, or a different design than this, and that will help me decide what to order! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
More comics coming soon! <br/>

color (even at extra cost), on a t-shirt. He&#39;s a 3X kinda guy.<br/>
