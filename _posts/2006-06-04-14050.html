<br/>
Language is a living, evolving thing. It is quite common for people to<br/>
disagree on word usage or grammar and as people begin to USE a certain<br/>
phrase/word/usage more it BECOMES &quot;proper&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have &quot;sloppy&quot; use of English, we have an AMERICAN way of<br/>
using English. That&#39;s how language changes. That&#39;s how the rules<br/>
evolve over time. There are more useful ways of presenting language,<br/>
better methods of communication...sure.<br/>
<br/>
But those are not &quot;incorrect&quot; ways of using &quot;but&quot;...they are part of<br/>
our language and considered regular usage now.  Straight from a<br/>
website about proper grammar too!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure that it becomes proper.  I think that it becomes &quot;accepted&quot;<br/>
which is different from &quot;proper.&quot;  The *proper* way to say something may be<br/>
quite different from the *accepted* way of saying something.  When I was in<br/>
college I had a professor who was a lawyer.  She was an alumnus or the<br/>
college so offered to teach 1 class each term pro bono (so to speak).  She<br/>
taught a speech course.  Not only how to correctly pronounce words, but also<br/>
how to use words.  She said that the reason that she was so compelled to<br/>
teach about speech was because of her years as a lawyer.  She said that a<br/>
lawyer&#39;s first line of defense is the spoken language.  A lawyer can tear<br/>
apart a witness or other lawyer by shredding their words and deciphering<br/>
what is a well-meant phrase.  Knowing how to correctly speak and use<br/>
language should be the top priority of any lawyer and while none of us in<br/>
the class were intending on becoming lawyers, it was still important for us<br/>
to know language.  She started my quest for learning how language should be<br/>
used verses how it is used.  I&#39;m one of those crazy people who really<br/>
enjoyed &quot;Eats Shoots and Leaves&quot; (and also the parody Eats Shites and Leaves<br/>
- I think that&#39;s the title).<br/>

<br/>
OH!  I pictured her with a sprouting flowerhead and then I realized the<br/>
word wasn&#39;t &quot;allium.&quot;    <br/>
<br/>
Deb, in the garden too much lately. <br/>
<br/>
Borrowing Marji&#39;s Post scripting habit... I didn&#39;t at first picture her<br/>
with a crystal head (alum)  but now I have to go find out why she&#39;s an<br/>
alumna, so thank you very much when I could be eating onions.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Everything you&#39;ve pointed out both in this and the previous email is a <br/>
matter of stylistic usage rather than a matter of either &quot;incorrect&quot; or <br/>
&quot;proper,&quot; both words you&#39;ve chosen to use. Within the English language <br/>
what has evolved or become &quot;accepted&quot; usage is precisely how either <br/>
&quot;correct&quot; or &quot;proper&quot; gets determined by the folks who write and publish <br/>
the big books.<br/>
<br/>
There was no such thing as standardized spelling (either correct or <br/>
incorrect) when the Declaration of Independence was written, for <br/>
instance. Now, however, there is &quot;correct&quot; and &quot;incorrect&quot; spelling, and <br/>
likely we all have computer programs that can tell those apart. One <br/>
could do some research on original documents (I know because I have <br/>
looked at many) and find numerous text written by several different <br/>
founding fathers and find &quot;errors&quot; in spelling, though that&#39;s not how it <br/>
was perceived at the time.<br/>
<br/>
For a long time, by way of another example, the grammar rule in English <br/>
was to use commas between all items in a series, including after the <br/>
last item before the coordinating conjunction &quot;and.&quot; Now, however, the <br/>
more accepted or preferred usage is to leave the final comma out. Give <br/>
it another 10 years or so of being &quot;preferred&quot; and the old way will soon <br/>
become &quot;incorrect.&quot; Complicate that scenario even further by taking a <br/>
gander at the several different style guides governing different <br/>
professions--commas are used differently, quotations are done <br/>
differently and are &quot;correct&quot; or &quot;incorrect&quot; only by virtue of context.<br/>
<br/>
Coming onto an elist and making broad claims about what&#39;s correct and <br/>
incorrect language is irritating, imnsho. Talking about the principles <br/>
behind our phrasing choices and the effects those choices are likely to <br/>
have will help us all gain a deeper understanding of unschooling and our <br/>
relationships with others--way more so than making stylistic <br/>
pronouncements as if they were absolute fact.<br/>
