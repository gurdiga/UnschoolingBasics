<div id="ygrps-yiv-384644732">I don&#39;t know if anyone can help me with this. It may be beyond the <br/>
parameters of this group. I&#39;m struggling with what to do about this <br/>
situation.<br/>
<br/>
My 17yo son went to live with his previously absent father on the <br/>
1st of this year. His father is very irresponsible. He has no idea <br/>
how to take care of himself, much less provide for another person. <br/>
He took one of my son&#39;s only two pairs of shoes right after he moved <br/>
there. They&#39;ve had their electricity turned off 3 or 4 times. My <br/>
mom, against my objections, signed a car she had over to his dad&#39;s <br/>
dad for my son to use. My son&#39;s driver&#39;s permit was revoked because <br/>
he wasn&#39;t attending school in NC and his dad couldn&#39;t be relied upon <br/>
to take him to DMV to get a VA license. Currently, the car is not <br/>
legally registered or insured but my son is still driving it. My son <br/>
has told me many times that he doesn&#39;t have any food. His dad <br/>
doesn&#39;t really have a job. He sporadically works for his father, who <br/>
doesn&#39;t always pay everyone. We gave our son a cell phone because <br/>
his dad can&#39;t seem to keep a phone active. His dad takes the phone <br/>
and uses it himself and leaves our son with no phone or any other <br/>
way to contact anyone.  <br/>
<br/>
I still have full legal custody of my son. There is no child support <br/>
order that requires us to give his dad any money. We don&#39;t mind <br/>
providing them with money to help with our son&#39;s necessities. <br/>
However, it is becoming more and more evident that not much of any <br/>
money we give them will go to necessities for our son. We don&#39;t want <br/>
our son to go hungry but we also don&#39;t like the idea of having to <br/>
support his dad. <br/>
<br/>
My husband said he was going to buy food and ship it to our son. <br/>
I&#39;ve gotten suggestions to send him gift cards for grocery stores so <br/>
we&#39;d at least know the money was being spent on food even if it is <br/>
for everyone, including their roommate. I&#39;ve also gotten suggestions <br/>
that I shouldn&#39;t give my son anything. If he&#39;s choosing to live <br/>
there, he needs to experience the full consequences of that. That <br/>
seems pretty harsh and not very generous or unconditional. I want to <br/>
support my son but I also don&#39;t want to make it easy for him to <br/>
adopt his dad&#39;s lifestyle. <br/>

I think there is a limit of what you can do to support him while he <br/>
is living there- is he trying to mske life better for his dad and <br/>
you are sort of the one who is going to help dad because you are <br/>
helping him- <br/>

Yes. He said if his dad goes to jail, which is a real possibility <br/>
right now, he guesses he will have to come home. I think he wants to <br/>
come home but either doesn&#39;t want to admit that or doesn&#39;t want to <br/>
tell his dad. That could just be my wishful thinking, though. His <br/>
dad said repeatedly that, if he moved there, he couldn&#39;t just leave <br/>
again at his whim. I disagreed, of course, and told my son he could <br/>
come home whenever he wanted.<br/>
========<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; how long was he unschooled- if at all<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>========<br/>
He attended school until almost halfway through 7th grade, when he <br/>
was 12. We tried school at home for a few months, which was a total <br/>
disaster. After that, we started unschooling but not really RU. He <br/>
chose to go back to school in the 9th grade, which he had to repeat, <br/>
but didn&#39;t go back again after the 2nd time. So, he was 16 when he <br/>
quit going to school again. After that was about 4 or 5 months of RU.<br/>
========<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; how much choice and freedom did he have at home<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>========<br/>
He had a lot of choice and freedom at home in those last few months. <br/>
I think he thought he would still have more at his dad&#39;s. What he&#39;s <br/>
found is that he has absolutely no supervision or guidance at all. I <br/>
guess you could call that more freedom but he has less of everything <br/>
else.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; what is it he is accomplishing by being at dads<br/>

At this point, I don&#39;t know and I don&#39;t think he does, either. I <br/>
know what he wanted to accomplish but that isn&#39;t happening.<br/>

No, I don&#39;t think this is the case. He is generous and caring so he <br/>
wouldn&#39;t want to not help his dad. I think it&#39;s more a case of him <br/>
needing things and his dad not providing them but he shares with <br/>
them because they all live together. Also, I think his dad just sort <br/>
of takes things. For example, when my mom bought ds a laptop his dad <br/>
said he could really use it. They all live together so they all <br/>
share, which would be fine if his dad were providing the majority of <br/>
what is needed. We don&#39;t mind helping them as long as we know our <br/>
help is being used for what is needed. The problem is that is not <br/>
happening. His dad is obviously not providing for him the way he <br/>
should be and it&#39;s not just a case of not having the means.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1990487742">Hi - this is a very tough one for sure - <br/>
<br/>
I have had members of my family go through similar things with divorces and break-ups - and this is a harsh lesson, but I think you have done everything that you can - you have left the door open to him - he probably won&#39;t let himself starve - most teenagers got hrough a period of time when they aren&#39;t eating well or are poor (students for instance) -   hopefully he won&#39;t get involved in anything illegal - but it probably has to be totally up to him to decide that he&#39;s had enough or to see that living with his dad may not be healthy or good for him -<br/>
<br/>
 it&#39;s not an easy lesson for kids to learn about a parent - they so don&#39;t want it to be true - but as long as he isn&#39;t in any real physical danger, he will survive and learn from it - it may take even as long as a few years. <br/>
<br/>
 I am also basing this on my own experience as an older teenager when I lived in Amsterdam for a 2 years and did some illegal stuff (not a lot more than hashish, and  that&#39;s barely illegal in A&#39;dam, but still...) - we lived in a squat and spent all our time getting stoned and selling hash to get more hash, etc - all very cool and hippie - eventually I got busted by being associated with some people that were dealing cocaine, that I wasn&#39;t directly involved with - very scary, foreign country, slapped in jail for an interminable 3 days not knowing what was going to happen...luckily they let me go and I was able to contact my family and get home - I continued the same sort of lifestyle back in the US until my mid-twenties when I finally started figuring out that that lifestyle wasn&#39;t what I wanted - I am 52 now with 2 children and a stable life, but it took me years to get here - <br/>
<br/>
So my point is (*and I do have a point*) is that he is going through his life - I&#39;m sure it is incredibly painful to watch - but I also think as I said in the beginning you may have done all you can for now, leaving the door open - and hopefully he is a wiser person than I was and he won&#39;t go so long or so far down an unhealthy road - but even as bad as I was, I was lucky that nothing too serious happened and I came out if it, and can now use those experiences to talk with kids about the realities of the &quot;druggie life&quot; having been there - I&#39;m not implying that he&#39;s going to be a druggie, rather that however scary it may be to you what he&#39;s getting into with his dad, it&#39;s probably NOT as bad as the druggie life and most likely he will (eventually) figure it out for himself.  You probably now have the hardest job of all parenting and that is letting him make his own mistakes, while also letting him know he can come to you anytime and there will be no recriminations or judgements or anything - the prodigal son thing, right?  Best wishes - Judy R. in Kingston<br/>

If you have the ability to help him be a little more comfortable <br/>
than maybe treat it like he was a kid away at camp or college- is <br/>
there a amount of money that you could send to him to do with what <br/>
he feels he needs to? <br/>
<br/>
Give him the money and let him be in charge of it- let him <br/>
experiment with it and see what happens- maybe he will use it just <br/>
for himself or may be generous and share-<br/>

Big hugs to you.  I have not had to go through this yet but I have a <br/>
lot of empathy for you.  I know as a young woman I put my mom <br/>
through some hard times.  Abusive relationship, unplanned <br/>
pregnancy.  As a mom to my own young woman I totally get how hard it <br/>
was for my mom to be there, keep her mouth shut and still let me <br/>
know she supported me as a person even though she was afraid my <br/>
decisions were hurting me.  She got advice to force me to go to a <br/>
shelter instead of letting me come home with my baby to make me <br/>
leave her father.  Thankfully she chose not to do that and I made my <br/>
own choice to protect myself and my daughter within a few months. I <br/>
still had my relationship with my mom to help me through the hard <br/>
times that followed.  <br/>
<br/>
This is the hardest thing you will ever do but remember your <br/>
relatioship with your son is the most important thing.  If you let <br/>
him make his own mistakes but let him know you are there for him he <br/>
will turn to you when he is ready.  I would definitely send him some <br/>
money regularly.  At 17 you are responsible for him even if it&#39;s not <br/>
a legal requiement.  Your physical as well as emotional support <br/>
shouldn&#39;t  be tied to him doing what you want him to do.  Most of <br/>
all check in with him regularly and ask him if he needs anything.  <br/>
He will come home when he&#39;s ready and the relationship will be that <br/>
much stronger.  <br/>

gift cards for groceries or for fast food places like Subway, where at  <br/>
least he&#39;ll be getting nutritious food. I&#39;d toss in some extras for  <br/>
him, too, like maybe a gift card to go to a movie. You want him to  <br/>
feel the love coming from you, and teens can be very concrete in how  <br/>
they sense love. Don&#39;t withdraw - don&#39;t let your hurt or anger or  <br/>
frustration at his father even appear to diminish your love for your  <br/>
son. And don&#39;t let him feel out of contact, no matter what it takes.  <br/>
Send him little things in the mail all the time - print out a comic  <br/>
strip that you think he&#39;ll like, or a magazine article about something  <br/>
he&#39;s interested in. Be creative. It doesn&#39;t matter too much what it is  <br/>
- he&#39;ll  know that you were thinking about him a lot, even though he&#39;s  <br/>
not there with you. Send him little things - often. A pair of shoes. A  <br/>
photo. Does he have an mp3 or cd player? You could make him playlists.  <br/>
Just trying to think of all the various ways you might constantly keep  <br/>
connecting supportively with him.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t worry so much that you&#39;re supporting his father, along with him.  <br/>
Your son won&#39;t see it that way - he&#39;ll see it as your strong love for  <br/>
him. Later, he&#39;ll think, &quot;She kept right on showing how much she loved  <br/>
me, even when I made such hurtful choices.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t that what you want?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1658758379">Thank you everyone for your responses. I didn&#39;t follow the &quot;proper&quot; <br/>
path to adulthood, either, so I think I have a lot of understanding <br/>
for what my son is going through/doing. I was so lucky that my mom <br/>
supported me financially through all my early fiascos.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is what I feel I should do. I&#39;ve been getting advice from others <br/>
telling me I shouldn&#39;t give him anything. He is choosing to stay in <br/>
that situation even though he doesn&#39;t have to so he should have to <br/>
deal with the consequences. The thing is that when it&#39;s a parent/child <br/>
relationship it&#39;s not that simple. It&#39;s not the same as if he had <br/>
moved out with a group of friends and was just partying all the time <br/>
and not doing anything else.<br/>
<br/>
My husband has already got a care package of food packed to send to <br/>
him. We&#39;re now just trying to decide whether to put regular deposits <br/>
in his bank account or send him Wal-Mart gift cards. I hate to support <br/>
Wal-Mart but that&#39;s where he shops and can get just about anything he <br/>
needs.<br/>

Thanks. He called yesterday and we had a really good conversation <br/>
about a bunch of nothing. He called while he was watching TV just to <br/>
talk. One thing he said that I thought was funny was that he doesn&#39;t <br/>
ask his paternal grandmother for money often even though his cousins <br/>
whom she has custody of ask her for money several times a day and <br/>
she gives it to them and all the money she makes goes to those kids. <br/>
He said she gives him money whenever he asks but he doesn&#39;t feel <br/>
comfortable asking anyone but me for money. That might seem kind of <br/>
strange but what it says to me is that he knows he can ask me and I <br/>
will give it to him if I can, whatever it is, without any hassle or <br/>
anything. That made me feel good.<br/>

  Sounds to me like in this parental challenge of showing unconditional love, you&#39;re screaming by in the fast lane :).  What a huge gift you&#39;re giving him by meeting HIM with love right where he is in this moment.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248166154">Hi--I really agree with the posts below.  <br/>
I was also thinking--if your the dad gets wind of possible gifts<br/>
coming in the mail and tries to intercept them or snag them, maybe get<br/>
a post office box? If it&#39;s convenient for your son to get to. Just a<br/>
thought.<br/>
