<div id="ygrps-yiv-1241737204">I am wondering about leaving my 12-YO home alone.  He doesn&#39;t want to <br/>
go anywhere.  We are deschooling and he is spending alot of time on <br/>
the computer and that is fine with me.  My 10-YO usually wants to <br/>
come along but sometimes he wants to stay home too and I don&#39;t feel <br/>
good about leaving them home alone together, so I talk my youngest <br/>
into going with me.  <br/>
<br/>
When I was 12, I remember coming home after school everyday and being <br/>
alone because my mom worked.  But this last time I left my 12-YO home <br/>
alone, there was a pile of lit matches next to a candle on the dining <br/>
table.  We keep the matches put away in a box and he had found them.  <br/>
However, we have been letting him light a candle at dinnertime (a <br/>
ritual we just recently started) and he said he didn&#39;t know he wasn&#39;t <br/>
supposed to light them, although I have told him before he can only <br/>
light the candle when we are in the room watching.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, about 3 afternoons a week I leave the house in the afternoons <br/>
to run some errands.  I try to think of things my oldest son might <br/>
want to do to get him to come along, but he just doesn&#39;t seem <br/>
interested.  My great-grandma (who&#39;s 102!) is in a nursing home and <br/>
he doesn&#39;t want to go with me to visit her and I can&#39;t say I blame <br/>
him due to the environment, but I feel sort of bad dragging my <br/>
younger son along.  <br/>
<br/>
Any advice would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s a far different situation than a child that WANTS to be left<br/>
home. As far as the matches, surely he&#39;s old enough to light candles<br/>
without an adult right next to him? We simply ask that the kids let us<br/>
know when they light a candle and that we dont&#39; light them in rooms<br/>
that nobody is going to be in (or blow them out if leaving the room<br/>
for good).<br/>
<br/>
We also ask that nobody use matches or stoves when we&#39;re gone, for<br/>
obvious reasons. So maybe if you just point out that it would be<br/>
better for an adult that knows how to handle an extinguisher (maybe<br/>
show him how to use one too) available when he&#39;s using matches, that<br/>
will be enough. It doesn&#39;t sound like he&#39;s truly a danger to himself<br/>
or anyone else when you&#39;re gone.<br/>
<br/>
Can he reach you on a cell phone? Trevor was helping out with his<br/>
younger siblings at 12 years of age (in short spurts) so I really<br/>
don&#39;t think it&#39;s a big deal for most 12 year olds to be home alone by<br/>
choice.<br/>
Depends on the individual of course.<br/>
