<div id="ygrps-yiv-627682349">This goes both ways too.  for many years I&#39;ve been in situations w/ <br/>
friends or family where the parent tells their child to hug or kiss me <br/>
hello or goodbye..  I&#39;m always saying, it&#39;s OK.  We&#39;ll kiss or hug if <br/>
we feel like it.  Sometimes I actaully have to stand my ground not to <br/>
be kissed if it&#39;s obvious that a child doesn&#39;t feel inclined.  (Usually <br/>
a newish friend bc hey! who wouldn&#39;t want to kiss ME!)  It&#39;s actually <br/>
gotten awkward bc I&#39;m countering what the parent is saying to do but <br/>
that&#39;s OK.<br/>
