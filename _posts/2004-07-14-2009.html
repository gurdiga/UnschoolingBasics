<div id="ygrps-yiv-955900344">&quot;I don&#39;t understand...I have a guy, he sits to pee, and<br/>
there is no more mess than when anyone else<br/>
pees....Why is there a problem?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My guys are really neat too.:) They get it from their Dad I guess....<br/>
I was beginning to think I was the only one in a household of guys, without pee around the toilet.<br/>
I guess most guys don&#39;t aim very well.<br/>
Heck, even my three year old, who stands up to pee, hasn&#39;t missed yet. I guess they&#39;re weird. GOOD!<br/>

We&#39;re in the clean potty club, too.  Although...if they&#39;re sleepy  their aim <br/>
gets off sometimes.  But they usually don&#39;t even raise the seat,  then, either.<br/>
 <br/>
I always thought learning how to hit the water was part of toilet  learning!<br/>
 <br/>
As for that other important issue, raising the seat...I never harped  on mine <br/>
to put it back down.  I figured if they could remember to put it  up, I could <br/>
remember to put it down when it was my turn!<br/>
