<div id="ygrps-yiv-806293223">Greetings to all!<br/>
<br/>
I am wondering if you can give me tips and pointers for unschoolers who are looking to get together on a regular basis.  I met with two women today and we decided that we are in need of a group that is more reflective of us.  I live in the Bible Belt state of TN which is full of Christian hsing groups in which me and my associates fear being witch hunted some days!  LOL!  We decided that we will start a group that is less focused on Christianity and more focused on the Earth and other areas of interests outside of religion.  It turns out that all three of us are unschoolers.  We decided that we want to meet once a week, kind of like a co-op type of situation.  We will talk more indepthly at our first meeting but my main goal is to make sure that this group is unschooling at its finest.  I do not want a classroom or teaching setting.<br/>
<br/>
I told them that I think that we can bring activities for the children to participate in if they want to and that they should be able to participate however they want.  The oldest child in each family is in K so I am sure the main activity will be playing.  My feeling is that if we want to promote recycling then we need to do the recycling and if the children want to participate then that is fine.  If we want to garden, then we should do the gardening and the children can participate if they want to.  <br/>
<br/>
We are all in agreement that we will rotate from house to house each week.  I would like your input before we meet this Friday so that I can make sure that we have some things to think about to make this a success on the front end.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate you all in advance!<br/>
<br/>
Much Love<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1065157815">We belong to a local homeschooling group. It is not an<br/>
unschooling group, but most of the activities are of<br/>
the type where schooling style does not matter. In the<br/>
summer time, we meet once a week in a park to play.<br/>
Rest of the year, we meet in a library. (I say we, but<br/>
it&#39;s actually dh with the kids. I work full time.)<br/>
People bring board games to share. Kids play, adults<br/>
join in or talk with other adults. Then there&#39;s &quot;gym<br/>
and swim&quot; at a local Y. Basically all of it is<br/>
playtime. It has worked very well for us and we&#39;ve got<br/>
to know many people that way.<br/>

  We belong to a local homeschooling group. It is not an<br/>
  unschooling group, but most of the activities are of<br/>
  the type where schooling style does not matter. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-234505738">This is a tuff one and why we took a break from weekly meets.<br/>
 <br/>
Not everyone is at the same stage in unschooling and not everyone is  <br/>
unschooling. Now you cannot be the unschool police but you can bring it up as a  <br/>
group discussion without the children.<br/>
I&#39;ve seen well known unschoolers in my area not really unschooling and  their <br/>
kids living in fear and more limits rules then a typical public schooler. <br/>
 <br/>
What if you opened up an unschooling discussion on your list if you have  <br/>
one? I&#39;ve found when we discussed exact situations that some of the parents had  <br/>
found unschooling through some whatever unschooling list and were very <br/>
confused  about the basic philosophy.<br/>
 <br/>
Groups can be a challenge to manage. You cannot please everyone but  you can <br/>
certainly keep the children from being harmed by  another.<br/>
 <br/>
Good luck,<br/>
