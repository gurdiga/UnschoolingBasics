<div id="ygrps-yiv-113352833">Hello all, <br/>
I am looking for some advice that may require you to stretch your <br/>
imaginations.  I am currently unschooling my 3 children (7, 5& 2).  The <br/>
need may arise in the near future that I begin to earn an income <br/>
(Ouch!) <br/>
Somewhere on this message board I read that technically speaking a <br/>
parent does not have to be at home with their children during the day <br/>
in order to home school them.  In other words, someone else can watch <br/>
your children during the day while you work.  I believe the person who <br/>
posted this question originally had grandparent to care for their <br/>
children. <br/>
<br/>
I am interested in facilitating unschooling (or home schooling) for <br/>
parents that work.  I know that most parents refer to be with their <br/>
kids, but I&#39;m sure that some of them just can&#39;t. I would provide a safe <br/>
place for their children to be while they worked.  I really could use <br/>
some suggestions if anyone has any.  Thanks.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Sandy, have you looked at any home based businesses?  Businesses like mine<br/>
are great for homeschooling families because it allows you to set your<br/>
&quot;business hours&quot; around the needs of your kids.  Start up in most of them is<br/>
fairly low and if you do your finances right you can actually make money<br/>
while you look like you lost money for the first couple of years(mileage is<br/>
my biggest saving grace!) I love working for myself.  I only work when I<br/>
want to work, I love what I am doing, I get quite a few incentives each year<br/>
and I can make my business as big or as small as I like.<br/>
<br/>
There are others on here who have home based businesses.  You can even get<br/>
your kids involved in the action.  My kids help me stamp my catalogs and<br/>
other items, assemble host and show packets, pack my crate, try new recipes,<br/>
and are my &quot;trial audience&quot; when I want to do a new recipe at a show.  They<br/>
also get paid for helping me.  I pay them 5Â¢ for everything that they stamp<br/>
and Emily get paid for watching her siblings when I have a show and she is<br/>
alone with them.  And it is tax deductible!  This past year Emily made less<br/>
than $500 in &quot;child care&quot; so she didn&#39;t have to report the income either!<br/>
But since your children are a bit younger than mine, you would be able to<br/>
deduct the child care expenses that you paid someone else.  You would have<br/>
to get an employee ID number, but it is quick painless and easy.<br/>
<br/>
Most home based businesses also have some sort of software that you use to<br/>
keep ahold of your business income and expenses.  I input all my mileage,<br/>
show expenses, supply orders, paychecks, etc. into the computer as they<br/>
incur and at the end of the year I click a button and a detailed expense<br/>
report including my odometer readings is printed.  I put all those numbers<br/>
into my TurboTax and generate my tax return!  (And since I use my tax<br/>
software to assist with my business it is also deductible!)<br/>
<br/>
There are home based businesses for ALL kinds of things.  Whether it is fine<br/>
quality cookware like I sell or make up or art materials or food or &quot;adult<br/>
toys&quot; or cleaning supplies or whatever, there is bound to be one that might<br/>
spark your creativity and still afford you the ability to work from home.  I<br/>
was making $500 a month working 9am-1pm four days a week.  Now I make that<br/>
same amount of money working just 12 hours a month outside of the home!  I<br/>
took a few weeks to choose my business.  I looked at several different ones<br/>
and had different criteria that I compared such as needing to carry an<br/>
inventory, audience I would be open to, sales to income ratio, quality of<br/>
the product, price range of the products, bonuses, incentives, sales aids,<br/>
etc.<br/>

service nearby. We don&#39;t have any family in the area<br/>
and there have been many times when I wished my kids<br/>
had some place to go to while I worked. But, I don&#39;t<br/>
really see me using it more than say 5 times a year.<br/>
Then again, I&#39;m not a single parent.<br/>
