<br/>
I do agree that trusting in unschooling opens connections and threads for<br/>
our kids every  where that we as a &#39;teacher&#39; would not see.<br/>
Being allowed to think freely allows them to understand things differently<br/>
than the way I was educated.  I am amazed and delighted to hear the<br/>
connections Rowan finds by herself.  Things I never thought of  so if I was<br/>
limiting how what she &#39;schools&#39;  I could be closing doors I don&#39;t even see.<br/>
<br/>
However, I think we as unschoolers we should not be upset to hear what<br/>
others are doing.<br/>
Rowan is very definitely an unschooler but she loves to do unit studies in<br/>
history. We did the greatest unit ever, based on Pirate Songs.  These were<br/>
songs she grew up loving at the Renaissance Faire.  Why would it not be<br/>
&#39;unschooling&#39; to say after hearing the word in a song for the umpteenth<br/>
time,<br/>
&quot; I wonder if there really IS a place called ~Mingula~&quot;   [It is an island<br/>
off the northern coast of Scotland]?<br/>
Or, &quot;Why would sailors be singing about Santa Anna?&quot;<br/>
Rowan and I  will continue to be casting sideways winks and grins at each<br/>
other every time another and another thread of this unit pops up though out<br/>
everyday life.<br/>
<br/>
  This summer we are playing a fantasy  of being enrolled in a Hogwarts<br/>
Correspondence School.<br/>
She places letters in a tree and I send her &#39;lessons&#39; based on HP books and<br/>
other magic or mythical subjects including Arithamancy.    I choose lessons<br/>
I know [as her unschooling mom] that she would love to explore.  In other<br/>
words she has already expressed an interest in them and I leave for another<br/>
possible time the subjects she has no interest in at this time.   Just<br/>
because she is having fun w Numerology does not mean she wants to memorize<br/>
the times  tables {{or maybe she will}}  Or read the Diagon Ally Gazette,<br/>
write reports, take OWL tests......<br/>
<br/>
So~~ this little section of our time together is not strictly unschooling<br/>
but that does not mean we are not unschoolers.   All she has to do give me<br/>
any clue she is not interested and the game will change or stop.<br/>
We don&#39;t keep it up any longer than she wants to and she picks and chooses<br/>
how in-depth she wants to work in a subject thread.<br/>
<br/>
If  a preschooler is having fun learning history on their level, then that<br/>
too can be an educational game and unschooling.<br/>
Of course, to *ME* a preschooler&#39;s goal is to play and have fun, not do<br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
However, any parent who talks w their child naturally teaches their kid<br/>
language and about the world.<br/>
How many squares and triangles have you counted w delight as you walked down<br/>
the road w your three year old?   :-)<br/>
Educational ops are everywhere.  Why should we as unschoolers not  raise a<br/>
question or two?  Isn&#39;t that part of a daily exchange?<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is not unlearning  and it is not only one way.  It can be very<br/>
parent hands on.<br/>
<br/>
I think you can have fun learning right alongside your kid and not direct<br/>
where/ when/ how it is they will proceed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-298860438">&lt;&lt;However, I think we as unschoolers we should not be upset to hear what<br/>

<br/>
A person who talks about &quot;teaching goals&quot; is not unschooling, or helping<br/>
others move towards an understanding of what unschooling is. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;So~~ this little section of our time together is not strictly unschooling<br/>
but that does not mean we are not unschoolers.   All she has to do give me<br/>
any clue she is not interested and the game will change or stop.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think all of your activities sound entirely &quot;strictly unschooling&quot;<br/>
actually, and truly delightful.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;If a preschooler is having fun learning history on their level, then that<br/>
too can be an educational game and unschooling.<br/>
Of course, to *ME* a preschooler&#39;s goal is to play and have fun, not do<br/>
school.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My impression of the other poster was that *her goals* were what was<br/>
important, and she was going to do all she could to make *her goals*<br/>
continue to be fun and enjoyable for her kids. That&#39;s fine, but it is not<br/>
unschooling. She has a prearranged timetable for commencing American<br/>
History. That is not unschooling. If the kid is interested in Am. History,<br/>
let her start at once in some way. If the kid has not expressed any<br/>
interest....well don&#39;t have a plan tied to a date in the future.<br/>
<br/>
In unschooling the phrase &quot;she may NEVER become interested in American<br/>
History&quot; is not terrifying, nor a reason to institute controls over the<br/>
kid&#39;s education.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;However, any parent who talks w their child naturally teaches their kid<br/>
language and about the world.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There was a recent thread about then idea of &quot;teach&quot; as a verb, or maybe I&#39;m<br/>
thinking of Sandra&#39;s essay on the subject ( www.sandradodd.com ). It doesn&#39;t<br/>
help people to keep that in their mind as how they are interacting with<br/>
their children, IF they are trying to become unschoolers. <br/>
<br/>
I liken it a bit to when you have a food sensitivity and you are on an<br/>
elimination diet. You have to get rid of *all* the dangerous food for a<br/>
period of time (in this case schoolish language) to become desensitized.<br/>
Eventually you are able to reintroduce limited amounts of the food without<br/>
it causing a reaction.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;How many squares and triangles have you counted w delight as you walked<br/>
down the road w your three year old?   :-)&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
None. I actually don&#39;t remember how Jayn learnt all her shapes, but she did.<br/>
I only counted for Jayn when she asked how many of whatever there was in<br/>
front of her. There is a world of difference between &quot;Jayn learnt&quot; and &quot;I<br/>
taught Jayn&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Educational ops are everywhere.  Why should we as unschoolers not raise a<br/>
question or two?  Isn&#39;t that part of a daily exchange?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In a way you are speaking of the idea of strewing. However I like to live as<br/>
though *life* opportunities are everywhere and Jayn will learn what she<br/>
needs - both skills and facts - to engage in the activities that interest<br/>
her. Joyce (Fetteroll) once wrote that in unschooling &quot;education happens as<br/>
a side effect&quot;. This isn&#39;t necessarily a &quot;Basic&quot; concept. <br/>
<br/>
If you are raising questions because you want to know the answer, or notice<br/>
something your child might be interested in but hasn&#39;t spotted, or have a<br/>
shared interest that you are both exploring, the dynamic of the question<br/>
raising is different from raising a question in order to subtly or covertly<br/>
direct your child&#39;s attention or experience, with some goal of your own in<br/>
mind. Goals that might include ensuring your child covers a topic fully, or<br/>
gets a well rounded education. These put the standards of success into a<br/>
schoolish framework. See how easy it can be to slide back into schoolish<br/>
thinking if you are not vigilant. (I&#39;m NOT suggesting that you are doing any<br/>
of that stuff, Dail!)   <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Unschooling is not unlearning and it is not only one way.  It can be very<br/>
parent hands on.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It is unlearning all the bad habits and language we all had ingrained into<br/>
us over the 12+ years of education most of us had - good or bad as the<br/>
experience may have felt at the time.<br/>
<br/>
There are practices that are not unschooling, however. If the way you are<br/>
engaging with your child is not unschooling, it harms all of us, especially<br/>
those struggling to change, if people who are &quot;Relaxed&quot; or &quot;Eclectic&quot; or<br/>
&quot;Unit-Studies&quot; homeschoolers are complacently calling themselves<br/>
unschoolers. No-one can control how a family wishes to label their<br/>
homeschooling style in the wider world. However on a list devoted to<br/>
unschooling I will continue to protest when the activities described and,<br/>
more importantly, the language used is not unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is *more* parents&#39; hands-on - because it is entirely<br/>
unpredictable. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;I think you can have fun learning right alongside your kid and not direct<br/>
where/ when/ how it is they will proceed.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That poster was talking about her intentions to continue to direct the<br/>
teaching of her children. <br/>
