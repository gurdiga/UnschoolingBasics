<div id="ygrps-yiv-1777328247">This site you have to sign up for and it kind of sounds like you have<br/>
to pay for this and you might have to if you download the lectures but<br/>
not if you listen at the computer.  I&#39;m listening to this one right<br/>
now and I didn&#39;t have to pay.  This is a South African Rabbi talking<br/>
about education being obsolete.  I haven&#39;t finished listening to this<br/>
one yet.  But I&#39;d be interested in what you all think and I believe I<br/>
may use this to &quot;explain&quot; to my family why the boys aren&#39;t being<br/>
forced into the &quot;three Rs&quot;<br/>

Education is Obsolete (May 26, 2008)<br/>
By: Rabbi David Lapin<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Education is Obsolete shiur is on a rather radical model for<br/>
elementary and high-school education going forward. Never before has<br/>
Torah been positioned as the most relevant educational force not only<br/>
for religion and personal development, but also for a new generation<br/>
of digital thinkers: the under 25-year olds who I have called (using<br/>
my own under-25-year-old son&#39;s term) E-Geners, or the generation of<br/>
exponential thinkers. I explain how nothing caters to the needs of<br/>
this generation better than an outstanding Torah education topped up<br/>
with world class Math and English. Armed with these skills, young<br/>
people could quickly qualify for any university entrance they please,<br/>
grow as Torah thought leaders, or become entrepreneurs in their own<br/>
rights.<br/>
