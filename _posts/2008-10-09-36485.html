My daughter and my cousin are both from China.  We were just there in<br/>
January.  If I can offer anything to Mo let me know.  I&#39;d be only too<br/>
pleased to help.<br/>

&gt; That doesn&#39;t necessarily mean travelling to China (Mo&#39;s current<br/>
&gt; favorite wish) but it does mean looking for a hundred and one ways<br/>
&gt; to meet her facination with China, even though if I dropped the<br/>
&gt; matter after one issue of National Geographic and a new cartoon<br/>
&gt; she&#39;d probably be &quot;satisfied&quot;. I know that she&#39;s not &quot;full&quot; yet.<br/>
