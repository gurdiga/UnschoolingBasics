<div id="ygrps-yiv-223670934">Hello All,<br/>
<br/>
Just wondering if anyone else has been at a point with a child when <br/>
it has become very difficult to enjoy their company? And if so, how <br/>
have you gotten through it?<br/>
<br/>
My 5yo dd is a challenge.  She is intense, extroverted, extremely <br/>
verbal, persistant, reactive, demanding, observant, sensitive, and <br/>
high energy.  While we love her for all that she is, her personality <br/>
has been hard to handle at times.  Shortly before coming to this <br/>
group, I started the journey of more mindful/positive/respectful <br/>
parenting.  I joined a few lists, have been reading recommended <br/>
books, and working on having a better relationship with dd, and <br/>
seeing her challenging traits in a different light.  It has not been <br/>
easy, to say the least, but I am commited to &#39;unschooling&#39; my <br/>
parenting and discipline, and have seen enough successes to know that <br/>
as inept as I feel, it is the right and better approach.<br/>
<br/>
At various times, and recently, we (dh and I) have been seeing Orion <br/>
trying new behaviors and testing waters.  For example, she will go <br/>
through periods of time when she is especially bossy and rude to her <br/>
sister, and nothing we seem to do (negotiating, diverting, waiting to <br/>
see if they work it out, etc.) helps the conflicts.  Lately she has <br/>
been very adamant about expressing her opinion, over what someone <br/>
else is saying, before hearing the other person out.  She has been <br/>
increasingly impolite -- deliberately pushing, jumping on, touching <br/>
other family members in annoying ways after being told it is <br/>
bothering someone. She has been (purposefully?)repeating negative <br/>
things she hears on tv/movies more and more often.  While we want to <br/>
respect where she is coming from, it is sometimes so very draining, <br/>
and difficult to remain positive.   We have been trying to be as non-<br/>
reactive as possible, talking through situations, etc. but I am sorry <br/>
to say that there have been a few days lately where we have been <br/>
slipping into the old reactions of impatience, anger, yelling etc. <br/>
<br/>
We have been hired a teenage babysitter that has been coming to <br/>
occupy the girls and give me a break, which helps.  We thought <br/>
perhaps an energy outlet like t-ball would help dd, but I am not sure <br/>
it has, although she seems to like it.  We are looking into a hs <br/>
support group, thinking that making new friends on a similar path <br/>
might be good for us all.<br/>
<br/>
I have been reassured that difficulties of this sort are normal for <br/>
her age, and I want to believe that, but I also do not know anyone <br/>
who has a child like Orion.  If I were to label her, I would <br/>
definitely say she is spirited to the maximum.  Sometimes, at the end <br/>
of the day, I cannot wait for bedtime to come so I can have some time <br/>
away from her.  When we go through these phases, it is hard to enjoy <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1755359841">Melissa,<br/>
    You are not an awful parent.  I assure you of that and know what I am<br/>
talking about.  My child, Keegan is 5 and we went through the &quot;rate your<br/>
child&quot; section of &quot;The Spirited Child&quot; book and if the highest was 5 he was<br/>
the highest with just one exception.<br/>
     Keegan sounds exactly like your child and I am sure I could even tell<br/>
you a few stories.<br/>
             He is Sensitive meaning he doesn&#39;t like to be touched (and you<br/>
would be surprised how many things touch you during the day) unless he want<br/>
to be, which is close to never.<br/>
             He is Spirited and I mean the kind of spirited that starts at<br/>
5:00am and doesn&#39;t stop until he passes out cold at around 9:30pm if your<br/>
lucky.<br/>
             He has sibling rivalry in a major way with his older sister<br/>
probably because she is an extravert also and they fight for that same kind<br/>
of attention.<br/>
     Oh I could go on and on about the things we have been through and like<br/>
you thought that getting him involved in things would be the best for him,<br/>
but in the long run it made it worse sometimes.  And, yes I have had days<br/>
when I have been thankful when his precious little head hit the pillow and<br/>
snoring sounds came out.<br/>
      I don&#39;t know if you tried martial arts, but for Keegan it really<br/>
seemed to pull something out of it.  He needed the focus and ability to see<br/>
someone letting off steam, but not directly hurting someone.  Initially I<br/>
thought; Yeah right teach him how to really hurt someone, but was I wrong.<br/>
I think all the focus on being courteous and having self control is starting<br/>
to sink in.<br/>
     I don&#39;t know if this is the case for your daughter, but for Keegan I<br/>
love that his personality is constant.  No matter where he goes or who he is<br/>
with his emotions are raw and out there.  The other kids in his martial arts<br/>
class are wearing masks while their there.  They are all composed and<br/>
thoughtful during class and then when they get outside they are crying,<br/>
whining and carrying on to their moms and dads.  With Keegan you get what<br/>
you see and I just love that.<br/>
    It also helped to look at things a little differently in my case.  I<br/>
needed to stop seeing the negative Keegan and start seeing the positive<br/>
things he did.  That isn&#39;t as easy as it sounds when you thought that you<br/>
were in a constant battle with a five year old.  When I woke up and saw that<br/>
when he wasn&#39;t tormenting someone or needing to wear his clothes just right<br/>
etc.. he had extreme happy moments.  You gotta love that!!<br/>
    I don&#39;t know if I helped at all, but atleast you know you are not the<br/>
only one out there with a child that just takes a little more energy than<br/>
the rest.<br/>

<br/>
My oldest was like Orion. She&#39;s 19 now and sometimes I&#39;m glad when she <br/>
goes off to bed, still!!!! I love her with all my heart - but she is <br/>
always &quot;on&quot; and sometimes I just feel like a worn out old grouch.<br/>
<br/>
So - either I get to join you as an awful parent or we&#39;re both just <br/>
being honest that our own very intense kids can exhaust us.<br/>
<br/>
Keep reading and working on the books you&#39;ve got - I think you said you <br/>
were reading PET and How to Talk -- do you also have &quot;The Explosive <br/>
Child?&quot; That one is my strongest recommendation. When you&#39;ve read them <br/>
- read them again - keep trying to pick out something from them to work <br/>
on. Look for small improvements in your relationships and take good <br/>
care of yourself so you are as strong and healthy as possible.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1097926452">We seem to have a challenging 5yo theme going here (and not just the <br/>
challenging boys, it seems).  Rest assured, you are not a bad <br/>
parent.  It seems like you are doing much to honor your child.  My DS <br/>
is all the things you mentioned, to the 100th degree.  We have good <br/>
days, and we have bad days... I do find a lot of time it&#39;s the <br/>
way &quot;I&quot; handle the situation and the mood I&#39;m in that day which <br/>
affects the way things go.  But having an intense child is <br/>
demanding.  Physically, emotionally, and mentally.  One thing I try <br/>
to do everyday is to consciously enjoy my child...it may be hard to <br/>
find that moment, today for me it was as we were walking to the car <br/>
to go to an appointment.  Well, I was walking, he was running, and <br/>
twirling, and laughing...down the sidewalk with one blue sandle and <br/>
one brown sandle on...and I thought, what a cool kid!-  <br/>

You&#39;re doing a very intense form of parenting, and are bound to have some<br/>
periods where the intensity is uncomfortable (unbearable maybe? lol).<br/>
You&#39;re not alone - there are many days I have wished I was unaware and could<br/>
just send my kids off to school and be alone.  But we are aware and, I<br/>
believe, making the very best choice to help our kids to grow up and through<br/>
their stages as whole and cherished people.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the things we&#39;ve done to help with giving me a break from the<br/>
intensity:<br/>
<br/>
*like you, we have had some babysitters<br/>
<br/>
*he watches TV/videos - I was always opposed to TV and he watched none for<br/>
the first 3 years, but it has actually been a nice addition to our house.<br/>
He and I appreciate the quiet time, which he was often unable to settle in<br/>
for before.<br/>
<br/>
*we have a second computer (passed down from my sister) which we have set up<br/>
for him to play games on.  That way we can be in the same room and he feels<br/>
connected to me while I get some personal time.  Also, it prevents him vying<br/>
with me for time on the computer which used to create conflict.<br/>
<br/>
* I try to find some quiet time to be just with him (usually while our 1.5yo<br/>
naps or plays with my dh) which helps us  when I need some non-interactive<br/>
time later. I&#39;ve already given him some focused time and he is more patient<br/>
with the time I want for myself or when I want to be in the same room but<br/>
doing a different activity.<br/>
<br/>
*He has a playspace in the house that is a place he can go alone, and other<br/>
people come in by invitation only.  I never thought he would want to play<br/>
alone, but I think the lack of distraction and the ability to set up his<br/>
play as he chooses and leave it up as long as he wants helps him to get<br/>
involved deeply which gives me some stretches of time to renew my energy.<br/>
Also he is experiencing that one way people get renewal is by having some<br/>
time alone.<br/>

I did read How to Talk, Sibling Rivalry, PET and The Spirited Child.  <br/>
I am currently in the middle of The Inner Work of Mindful Parenting <br/>
and Whole Child/Whole Parent. I need all the help I can get!  Who is <br/>
the Explosive Child by?<br/>
<br/>
I am thinking that after I read through the last few, I will go back <br/>
and re-read the ones that made the most sense.<br/>
<br/>
I have been doing well at taking care of myself.  When I get <br/>
overwhelmed to the point where I &#39;feel a spanking coming on&#39; I have <br/>
been letting dh know he needs to take over, or if he is unavailable, <br/>
retreating to the bedroom with the door closed for a little while, <br/>
even if that means the kids have to pout/squabble/run wild while I do <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
I have also been chalking up communication failures to needing more <br/>
practice.<br/>
<br/>
But the guilt still comes in full when the thoughts like &quot;I can&#39;t <br/>
stand her anymore today&quot; pop into my head...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Thank you for this.  A few reassuring and understanding words is <br/>
sometimes enough to carry one through for quite awhile.  I used to <br/>
talk to my mother when the times got tough, but feel like I can&#39;t <br/>
anymore because she is very against the idea of homeschooling, and <br/>
her advice started to be &quot;this is why you need to send her to <br/>
school.  You&#39;ll never be able to handle it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks also for the suggestions.  Most we are already utilizing, but <br/>
you gave me a few new ideas I will try right away!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;He watches TV/videos - I was always opposed to TV and he watched <br/>
 </span></blockquote>none for the first 3 years, but it has actually been a nice addition <br/>
to our house. He and I appreciate the quiet time, which he was often <br/>

<br/>
I do get a blessed break when Orion decides to watch a movie.  We <br/>
recently cancelled our expensive satelitte service because dh and I <br/>
did not feel we were using it enough to justify the cost.  It was <br/>
almost solely used for kids programs, which we decided we can rent.  <br/>
So, we have subscribed to a dvd service and get movies from the <br/>
library (saving $40/month!). <br/>
<br/>
However, we have noticed that because Orion is so observant and <br/>
analytical, she picks up on many negative aspects of shows and <br/>
focuses on them/acts them out with intensity (BECOMES the show). She <br/>
is doing this even with carefully chosen videos -- mainly living <br/>
anything negative she might see/hear, even though we have always <br/>
tried to discuss what is seen, and right vs. wrong ideas, etc.  It is <br/>
un-nerving.<br/>

high-spirited children and decided to stay mum and just listen to <br/>
those in the know about them. Laurie was nowhere near high-spirited.<br/>
<br/>
 What did come to mind was the admiration I have for you parents who <br/>
are giving these special children this kind of parenting. Sending <br/>
them to school might be easier during the day, but it would be worse <br/>
when they got home from school and had to get their day (in prison) <br/>
out of their systems. Melissa, your mother shows little faith in <br/>
your abilities, but the rest of us here know you&#39;re giving your <br/>
child the best she could possibly get. <br/>
<br/>
One of my nephews is high-spirited and he spends his days in school <br/>
and his time away from school with controlling parents. He doesn&#39;t <br/>
know if he&#39;s coming or going half the time and makes life difficult <br/>
for everyone around him. The other day I saw his 6-year old brother <br/>
close his eyes, cross his legs, put his hands on his knees and <br/>
say &quot;Ohmmmmmmm&quot; in a meditative way. When he finished, he looked at <br/>
me and said, &quot;THAT&#39;s how I handle my brother.&quot; I wish he&#39;d show his <br/>
parents how to Ohmmmmmmm. :-)<br/>

situations and kids that work out well for us.<br/>

DRAMATIC.  Yes, we know that word here.  Often, it is best if we <br/>
ignore/not make a big deal of things she says/acts out, because if we <br/>
do, it is just fuel...  But there are just some things that we cannot <br/>
ignore.<br/>
<br/>
For examples:<br/>
<br/>
Something Orion has been doing for awhile is making her Barbies <br/>
embrace and kiss, just like the prince & princesses from her Disney <br/>
movies.  I have hoped this is normal, and have chosen to say little <br/>
about it.  It makes dh very uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
We rented an Arthur video with an episode about baseball, since Orion <br/>
just started t-ball.  She must have watched (studied) that movie 20 <br/>
times.  I did not sit and watch the entire thing with her, but heard <br/>
enough to recognize some of DW&#39;s negative phrases coming out of <br/>
Orion&#39;s mouth the following week.  &quot;No one likes me,&quot;  &quot;No one loves <br/>
me anymore,&quot; and &quot;That&#39;s not fair.&quot;  She was repeating so often we <br/>
have had to address it, almost to no avail.<br/>

things related to whatever the French phrase is while repeating the word or<br/>

people in all different settings about to eat or being served a meal and<br/>
saying &quot;bon appetit&quot; to each other.  Anyway, maybe she&#39;d like something like<br/>
that because it would give her lots to repeat and an interesting new skill<br/>
at the same time (and probably is less annoying to everyone else than DW&#39;s<br/>

I have been thinking the same thing.  In fact, I saw there was a <br/>
kids&#39; drama camp offered by the college close to us -- starting at <br/>
4yo.  By the time I saw it in the paper, it was a little out of our <br/>
means for this year.  Maybe next year.  I could definitely see her <br/>
becoming an actress!</div>

Me too.  For a long time.  And I think I&#39;m okay...  Dh is just not <br/>
sure what to think at all.  I told him not to get concerned -- it <br/>
must be a normal early exploration into sexuality/relationships that <br/>
I suspect most girls go through. Or at least I remember going through <br/>
with most of my friends and cousins.<br/>
<br/>
The one time I said anything to her, I asked her what she was <br/>
playing.  She said they were married, and I casually said, well, you <br/>
know married people do lots of things, not just kiss.  Like, making <br/>
dinner and shopping and taking care of the house or kids or going fun <br/>
places.  She said I know and that was it.  And they are still kissing <br/>
all the time.  Sometimes I walk by and say woo-wooo because I can&#39;t <br/>

they really need is as much opportunity for &quot;dramatic play&quot; as <br/>
possible. They need other kids to play with, props of all kinds and <br/>
uninterrupted play time.<br/>
<br/>
Roxana went through a phase at about 11 years old when she was REALLY <br/>
cranky and just going around bugging everybody all the time. I realized <br/>
that her big sister, 14, had suddenly stopped playing pretend with her <br/>
- stopped playing with stuffed animals, stopped playing star trek, etc. <br/>
Rox needed more dramatic play time. Since Roya was the one being most <br/>
bugged by her, I pointed this out to Roya and she decided to <br/>
voluntarily play Star Trek with Rox for an hour a day (it often <br/>
stretched into more). This was enough to make a dramatic difference in <br/>
Roxana&#39;s behavior - it was very noticeable - she turned back into our <br/>
happy pleasant little girl, overnight!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sorry to answer a question with a question, but &quot;socialization&quot; has been a<br/>
bit of an issue around here for me lately, and I wanted to throw this out<br/>
there. My son turns 4 this week, and he just does not function very well in<br/>
social situations - he completely shuts down around unfamiliar kids, and is<br/>
awkward and stressed even around those he knows well. At home or among close<br/>
relatives he is relaxed, talkative and charming. He doesn&#39;t like to go out<br/>
much and prefers to stay home most days. My dilemma is that I really don&#39;t<br/>
know how to tell if this is just a normal personality variation that I just<br/>
need to accept, or a deeper problem that needs working on. It seems like he<br/>
would like to reach out to kids more often, and would like to be more at<br/>
ease with them, so in that sense it creates a problem, but is it serious<br/>
enough to require a more concerted effort? Therapy? How do I know? The<br/>
ongoing dilemma for me is that I honestly don&#39;t know if he needs me to limit<br/>
social situations at this point or if he needs me to give him more<br/>
opportunities in which to improve his skills. I would love to know how<br/>
people make these decisions. I hate to put him in uncomfortable situations,<br/>
but does keeping him away from them make it harder for him to develop in<br/>
this area?  Ack!<br/>

This is very true in my case.  My son who is sensitive and spirited only<br/>
becomes more so when we have been out.  Now &quot;outsiders&quot; tend to think that<br/>
our lifestyle caused this, but I know for a fact he has always been this way<br/>
from day one.  If we honor his feelings instead of making him join a million<br/>
different activities to try to ground him we are in for a big surprise at<br/>

     I am and have always been an introvert with shy tendencies.  To this<br/>
day I get nervous just thinking about entering a room with a large group of<br/>
people or even worse a small group of people.  It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t want to<br/>
be social it&#39;s just that I CAN&#39;T be.<br/>
     My parents were very social people and it was very hard for them to<br/>
understand that I was o.k. the way I was/am.<br/>
     My advice would be to let him grow.  If he wants to try and asks to go<br/>
some place where there will be a crowd just let him try.  If he doesn&#39;t like<br/>
it when he gets their that&#39;s o.k. to.  Pushing it will only make it worse<br/>
and it WILL develop in to a complex.  He is too young at this point to worry<br/>
about whether he needs therapy.  Let this play out a little.  Take him to<br/>
the park if he meets up with kids and wants to play with them he will.<br/>
     It&#39;s beautiful that he is comfortable with you and the family.  I was<br/>
never comfortable in my own skin at home, because I seemed so unaccepted.<br/>
Who know what could have happened if they had just let me be me.<br/>
    Don&#39;t know if I helped, but I feel for him.  I know him.  I look at him<br/>
in the mirror every day and you know what I like what I see.....<br/>

is<br/>
  awkward and stressed even around those he knows well. At home or among<br/>

  much and prefers to stay home most days. My dilemma is that I really don&#39;t<br/>
  know how to tell if this is just a normal personality variation that I<br/>
just<br/>
  need to accept, or a deeper problem that needs working on. It seems like<br/>
he<br/>
  would like to reach out to kids more often, and would like to be more at<br/>
  ease with them, so in that sense it creates a problem, but is it serious<br/>
  enough to require a more concerted effort? Therapy? How do I know? The<br/>
  ongoing dilemma for me is that I honestly don&#39;t know if he needs me to<br/>
limit<br/>
  social situations at this point or if he needs me to give him more<br/>
  opportunities in which to improve his skills. I would love to know how<br/>
  people make these decisions. I hate to put him in uncomfortable<br/>
situations,<br/>
  but does keeping him away from them make it harder for him to develop in<br/>
  this area?  Ack!<br/>

Mikey, dd and I have been sick, one at a time, for the last week and <br/>
a half. I&#39;ve made up for some of the lack of socializing by playing <br/>
tons with him. It&#39;s certainly easier for both of us to have some <br/>
variety in playmates, though!<br/>
<br/>
You should see him when we get to large family gatherings. He is in <br/>
heaven when he has cousins around...I wish we lived closer to family.<br/>
<br/>
I keep trying. Two of his friends are moving away in the next few <br/>
weeks. I&#39;ve got two short trips and a visit from Grandmom planned for <br/>
July. We&#39;ve got a lot of new neighbors and some of them seem great to <br/>
play with. Some of them let their 3 and 4 yr olds play in the street <br/>
while the parents are in the house, and I&#39;m not going to do that <br/>
until Mikey starts actually looking both ways before saying &quot;no cars <br/>
coming, it&#39;s safe&quot;!!<br/>

building huge, fancy track layouts and acting out all sorts of things <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-268125156">Hi, Kate, and welcome.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is the same way to the &quot;nth&quot; degree and I used to wonder what<br/>
was &quot;wrong&quot; - and I am an introvert!  Mary Sheedy Kurcinka&#39;s book &quot;The<br/>
Spirited Child&quot; talks a lot about introvert / extrovert and that was the<br/>
book that finally changed my thinking around to accepting and celebrating<br/>
the extreme introvert that my child is.  I think it is doubly hard because<br/>
it is my belief that it is our cultural norm here in the US anyway to value<br/>
and celebrate extroverts - they are the ones who &quot;get things done&quot; the &quot;go<br/>
getters&quot; etcetera.  I think the contributions and skills of introverts are<br/>
vastly undervalued and that affects all of our thinking.  I myself used to<br/>
feel I was just &quot;stuck&quot; with being an introvert - it would be so much better<br/>
to be extroverted.<br/>
<br/>
After reading Mary&#39;s book, I stopped trying to &quot;get&quot; my daughter into social<br/>
situations I wanted her to handle, or to particularly value that, and I<br/>
started to notice and nurture the ways in which she feels comfortable<br/>
meeting others (small groups actually one on one or one on two is best; at<br/>
our house is best for a while and almost a must the first time).  My<br/>
daughter loves playing with other kids she likes (and she certainly doesn&#39;t<br/>
like or have to like them all) in an environment that feels safe to her and<br/>
what I think I understand now about her personality is that what affects her<br/>
safety level is her exteme sensitivity to others.  This is a wonderful<br/>
gift - I&#39;ve seen her comfort other kids, she cares so much about their<br/>
feelings.  She is also very sensitive to the safety of others in a situation<br/>
and how that makes her feel - rough play among other kids in a close<br/>
environment will make her feel unsafe for instance even if it is not<br/>
directed at her.<br/>
<br/>
So I do not believe there is anything wrong with your daughter, possibly<br/>
just something faulty with our own culturally ingrained values and<br/>
expectations.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>
Joan<br/>

always been quiet around large groups of children until just this month <br/>
really.  If there&#39;s 3 or less kids other than him he does ok.  One on <br/>
one is even better.   He&#39;s now growing out of this, it seems, and is <br/>
open to hanging out with kids and even approaching some at parks and at <br/>
Jeepers (like Chuck E Cheese).  This is all very recent for him, but <br/>
totally normal for HIM.  KWIM?  I didn&#39;t push him to be &quot;more social&quot; <br/>
and he did it in his own time.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; At home or among close relatives he is relaxed, talkative and charming.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, yeah, just like my baby boy.  Friends who didn&#39;t know Aydn well yet <br/>
would comment on how quiet he is and I&#39;d laugh because at home we <br/>
couldn&#39;t shut him up if we wanted to.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My dilemma is that I really don&#39;t know how to tell if this is just a <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nah, just accept who he is -- and who he is right now may not be the <br/>
same as a year or two from now.  He isn&#39;t complaining about not having <br/>
more friends, is he?  This is normal for HIM and he&#39;ll out grow it -- <br/>
or not -- but you can&#39;t force him to change who he is.  Just relax and <br/>
let him be.  :)<br/>

little guy needs to go to therapy!<br/>
<br/>
Do you have any friends with quiet, laid back children?  Maybe you <br/>
could invite them over to just hang out.  Don&#39;t call it a &quot;play date&quot; <br/>
necessarily  so that the &quot;focus&quot; isn&#39;t on your DS and watching what <br/>
happens.  Just invite them over to hang out and do something all <br/>
together, but don&#39;t try to push him toward the other child(ren).  Just <br/>
let what happens happen.  :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; My question is:  How many kids are we talking about?  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In some cases, it only takes 1, but it gets worse when there are more.  He<br/>
warms up more quickly to babies and adults.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; He isn&#39;t complaining about not having <br/>
 </span></blockquote>more friends, is he?  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Well, he isn&#39;t complaining exactly - usually he tells me he doesn&#39;t like<br/>
kids (except his 18month old sister) but sometimes I can see that he wants<br/>
to connect more. Recently we had an experience where he wanted to invite a<br/>
new neighbor boy over, but when the boy got here, Alex could barely speak to<br/>
him at all - I could tell he was really frustrated and embarrassed , even<br/>
though the other child was very understanding.  I just wished I could help<br/>
him more.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I certainly don&#39;t think (from what you&#39;ve written) that your sweet <br/>

<br/>
I added the therapy thing because several people have mentioned to me<br/>
recently that maybe I should have him &quot;evaluated&quot; - I really am not anxious<br/>
to do that, or slap any kind of label on his behavior, but I do wonder<br/>
sometimes at what point it is considered problematic - I don&#39;t want to be<br/>
all in denial if he really needs more help than I can provide at some point.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My son is a wonderful person, and I have always tried to honor his<br/>
personality for what it is, and that is what led me to unschooling - I never<br/>
dreamed I&#39;d homeschool my kids until I woke up one morning and realized that<br/>
my child didn&#39;t belong in a classroom, and much reading and considering<br/>
later, here I am. It is just hard to know, when you encounter a problem area<br/>
whether it is an area that needs more attention or less attention. <br/>
