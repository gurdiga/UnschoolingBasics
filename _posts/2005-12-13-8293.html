2005 Conference CDs <br/>
&quot;Oh the Places I&#39;ve Been!&quot; - Roya Sorooshian $10 <br/>
An up close and personal talk about Roya&#39;s experiences as a &quot;growing-<br/>
up&quot; unschooler. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Mother and Daughter: Our Unschooled Life Together&quot; - Pam Sorooshian <br/>
and Roya Sorooshian (Double CD set) $15 <br/>
Mother and daughter &quot;compare notes&quot; on what it was like growing up <br/>
unschooled. What did mom think she was doing? How did daughter <br/>
experience it? What do they wish had been different? What was the <br/>
best part? <br/>
<br/>
Anne Ohman - In Search of Riverglass & So that ALL Children May <br/>
Shine <br/>
(2 in 1 CD) $15 <br/>
<br/>
&quot;In Search of Riverglass...Finding Unschooling&quot; - Anne Ohman<br/>
An unschooling essay from the place where my mind is free to think <br/>
its best thoughts ~ our simple cabin on the beautiful upper Delaware <br/>
River. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Unschooling: So that ALL Children May Shine!&quot; - Anne and Jake Ohman <br/>
$10 <br/>
Join Anne and her always unschooled son, Jake (15) as they talk <br/>
about their journey to unschooling and how they believe that <br/>
unschooling allows all non-typical (as well as more typical! ;-) <br/>
children (Highly Sensitive, Out of Sync) to Shine by Honoring and <br/>
Celebrating Who They Are. These are the sensitive spirits who would <br/>
be quickly destroyed in a schooled environment, and who would most <br/>
likely be labeled and sent on a path of being *fixed*. When we talk <br/>
about *Shining* with unschooling, we are talking about the gift that <br/>
this glorious unschooling path offers to our children...the gift of <br/>
being able to follow their own hearts, their own passions and share <br/>
their gifts with the world. This is how all children should Shine. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;This is where unschooling lives...&quot; - Anne Ohman $10 <br/>
Join Anne for a day in the life of her unschooling family and all <br/>
the connections that just one, simple day can bring, as well as <br/>
further thoughts about how her family came to live in this space <br/>
(and how you can, too!) where infinite possibilities exist...this <br/>
glorious place called unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Unschooling a Tribe&quot; - Ren Allen $10 <br/>
How do age differences among children play into unschooling? How do <br/>
parents effectively meet the needs of several ages in one family? <br/>
We&#39;ll explore the unique challenge that face larger families and <br/>
different ways unschooling parents have met these challenges. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Mindful Parenting&quot; - Ren Allen with Sandra Dodd $10 <br/>
How does parenting style and choice affect unschooling? Why does <br/>
mindful parenting play such an important role in the way unschooling <br/>
develops? Sandra and Ren came to unschooling and mindful parenting <br/>
along different paths, but now find the same philosophies to be of <br/>
ultimate importance. <br/>
Saying &quot;yes&quot; more often, respecting children&#39;s choices and letting <br/>
go of arbitrary rules will be discussed, and how they affect the way <br/>
learning unfolds. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Unforeseen Benefits of Unschooling&quot; - Sandra Dodd $10 <br/>
When my oldest was five, I could see the potential of unschooling. I <br/>
knew unschooling families and was familiar with alternative <br/>
education. I had no doubt things would work out well. There were <br/>
unexpected outcomes, though, and they continue to arise. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Connections&quot; - Sandra Dodd $10 <br/>
Where does learning happen, and how? Unschooling can provide time, <br/>
space and opportunity for wonderful things to unfold. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;The Early Years&quot; - Robyn Coburn $10<br/>
Once you take out any academic pressures with these younger-than-<br/>
school-age folk what is left is the Radical or whole life part of <br/>
RU Â– I will talk about how I have found that &quot;to trust&quot; is an action <br/>
as well as an emotion and how Trust is the foundation of parenting <br/>
into a life of Unschooling with Joy. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Whole Life Unschooling &quot; - Danielle Conger $10 <br/>
Why do some AP parents lose trust that children will learn all they <br/>
need about the world in their own way and own time when given <br/>
freedom and opportunity to explore? What is it that changes in <br/>
parents (because the children don&#39;t change) that we stop trusting <br/>
our children and reveling in the wonder and awe we felt as they took <br/>
their first steps? As AP parents, we rejected the experts who tell <br/>
us to train our babies: what makes us reluctant to reject the <br/>
experts that tell us to train our children? <br/>
<br/>
By exploring the connections between Attachment Parenting and Whole <br/>
Life Unschooling, we&#39;ll discover how to continue living joyfully <br/>
with our children in amazement and wonder by giving them the freedom <br/>
and trust to continue learning about the world around them as they <br/>
have *always done*. We&#39;ll look at the ways in which Whole Life <br/>
Unschooling can be a simple continuation of the ideals and <br/>
principles of AP and how parents of young children can hold onto <br/>
that amazement, wonder and trust as they begin their journey into <br/>
Whole Life Unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Out of School and Into the Real World&quot; & &quot;How Music Breaks the <br/>
Rules&quot; - Kelly & Ben Lovejoy (2 in 1 CD) $15 <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Out of School and Into the Real World&quot; - Kelly Lovejoy $10<br/>
Many unschooling families start from the beginning---family bed, <br/>
extended nursing, no bedtimes, no school... But what if you don&#39;t <br/>
even learn about unschooling until after the damage of school has <br/>
been done? <br/>
<br/>
Kelly will talk about how she and her husband started unschooling <br/>
after eight years of pushing their son in private school. She&#39;ll <br/>
describe the difficult deschooling and the eventual blossoming of <br/>
their son into a radical unschooler. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;How Music Breaks the Rules&quot; - Ben Lovejoy $10<br/>
I hope to show how the music from my lifetime has transcended time <br/>
and found its way into my sons&#39; lives and the connections that have <br/>
formed as a result. I will also explore how those connections have <br/>
come full circle, and I have connected with their music as well. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Traits for Success&quot; - Wes Beach $10<br/>
I&#39;ve watched many hundreds of teens move on successfully to college, <br/>
employment, and many other endeavors with little or no academic <br/>
preparation, traditional or otherwise, at the high school  level.  I <br/>
have come to believe that it&#39;s not academic preparation that&#39;s <br/>
foundational; what matters are personal traits.  I&#39;ll discuss these <br/>
traits in general and in the lives of students I&#39;ve worked with. <br/>
