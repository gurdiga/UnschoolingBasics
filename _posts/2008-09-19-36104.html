<div id="ygrps-yiv-1674897242">My DD Faith and I had a talk tonight, I asked her what she was <br/>
interested in learning, she told me, the history about the 1950&#39;s.<br/>
She also wants to learn more about reading and world history.  She is <br/>
into baking.<br/>
<br/>
She did a lot of play this week.  We enjoyed the last day of the <br/>
spray park with some other HS kids.  We also enjoyed a day at the <br/>
beach with HS kids.<br/>
<br/>
Today she started messing around with some old phonics computer <br/>
games, they are way to easy for her.  She really enjoyed them, <br/>
however.  We laid on my bed and took turns making up a sentence for a <br/>
story about a Dog named Fart, we laughed and laughed.  She and I were <br/>
talking about herds of animals and we tried to think of how many were <br/>
in a herd.  I showed her how to look it up in the dictionary. <br/>
Apparently they don&#39;t teach that in 3rd grade.  We took her out of <br/>
school last Feb. during 3rd grade.  We also read a book she is <br/>
interested in.  She counted hops around the pool as well.  We had a <br/>
really nice day.  <br/>
<br/>
She is also enjoying being the main caretaker of a 10 week old foster <br/>
puppy we picked up from the surrender on tuesday.  Of course she <br/>
wants to keep it, however we are at the town limit.  The puppy is <br/>
being adopted next sunday.  So we are doing volunteer work as well.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think we are on the right track?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t imagine asking one of my kids what they are interested in <br/>
learning. If one of them is seeming bored I might ask if there&#39;s <br/>
anything in particular they want to *do*, or just try spending more <br/>
time with them, be more a part of the daily &quot;doing&quot; and see what <br/>
directions they are going in, where they get stuck, what&#39;s <br/>
inspiring, and then look for ways to support that process. <br/>
<br/>
Learning isn&#39;t something you have to think about doing or choose to <br/>
do - its a natural part of living life. <br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you have a pretty full life! Puppies and cooking and <br/>
beaches. Laughing and talking and reading and thinking. Playing <br/>
games. All good stuff - and all Full of learning, every moment. You <br/>
don&#39;t need to look for ways to add to that right now. If she&#39;s busy <br/>
and happy, that&#39;s great! <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I showed her how to look it up in the dictionary. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>This sort of thing happens pretty naturally in my house. It took <br/>
awhile for it to &quot;feel&quot; natural with my stepson, who left school at <br/>
13, so for awhile we&#39;d kind of skimp on &quot;how to find this out for <br/>
yourself&quot; sorts of information. We&#39;d just tell him what he wanted to <br/>
know. Nowadays he&#39;ll come and ask &quot;how do I find a recipe for pizza <br/>
dough?&quot; or whatever and we&#39;ll show him how to look up the <br/>
information. But then again, *I* might ask him &quot;how do I find out <br/>
what bands Richard Thompson has played in over the course of his <br/>
career?&quot; and Ray will show me. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you think we are on the right track?<br/>

That&#39;s great! <br/>
<br/>
Its a process. It takes time to get out of the habit of thinking in <br/>
terms of &quot;learning experiences&quot; or &quot;teachable moments&quot; or whatever. <br/>
<br/>
For now, continue to work on seeing the learning that happens in <br/>
normal, natural, everyday sorts of things - in everyday sorts of <br/>
Play! Not just &quot;academic&quot; learning, but learning about emotions, <br/>
ideas, and preferences. About communication, problem solving, and <br/>
awareness. So much of that learning happens under and around the <br/>
stuff we call &quot;play&quot; that its easy to miss or disregard. <br/>
