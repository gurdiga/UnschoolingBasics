<div id="ygrps-yiv-641607732">I have no idea about his prep for college because I&#39;m in Canada.  Your son sounds really unhappy and I would be too if some school was telling me I wasn&#39;t good enough for them.  Screw them, really.  He&#39;s asking to come home  - listen to him!!!  Then he&#39;ll at least be happy and relaxed and you can figure out together what he needs in order to get to college.  Does HE want to go to college??  Others here will have more info on what his next step should be if he does.  Welcome to the list!  Oh, and read some John Holt.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1344302723">My oldest son Austen 16 1/2 decided last November to step outside of<br/>
public high school and give traditional independent study<br/>
homeschooling a try. He chose this because he wanted to play it safe<br/>
so he could re-enter high school if he wanted and still be up to date<br/>
with his credits. After about 4 months he realized that he loved being<br/>
on his own and wanted to take the high school proficency exam and be<br/>
done with it completely.He took the test in July, passed and is now<br/>
taking 2 classes at Santa Monica Community College...drawing and<br/>
psychology. He has a part time job and has loads of friends. He is so<br/>
happy now...still decompressing from 10 years of public<br/>
schooling...ugh. He has blossomed and loves to sleep!<br/>
It has been an amazing process to watch. I have trust that he will<br/>
find his way...more trust now than I would have when he was in school<br/>
because I could not help but be affected by all of the scores, grades,<br/>
college pressure, competition, etc.Now he is free to take any class he<br/>
wants at SMC, online, etc. If he wants to go to college it seems to be<br/>
a much easier route to go to community college first and then<br/>
transfer. He has friends from all walks of life as far as schooling<br/>
goes(private, public)...they all seem pretty bored for the most part.<br/>
If I can help you in any way let me know! If you don&#39;t already own a<br/>
copy of The Teenage Liberation Handbook, get it! It changed our lives<br/>
and got us on this course.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe, maybe not. Unschooling won&#39;t get in the way of college, but  <br/>
the ignorance of admissions staff about what to do with an  <br/>
unschooler&#39;s application might make it difficult to get into a  <br/>
particular college.<br/>
<br/>
Upper tier colleges are a lot more familiar with unschooling so the  <br/>
admission staff knows how to handle it. Lower tier schools  are more  <br/>
used to shuffling papers of less than stellar kids who are jumping  <br/>
through the college hoop to get some kind of job on the other side so  <br/>
don&#39;t know what to do with kids who are on a quest to explore an  <br/>
interest.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that can help is for him to take community college courses  <br/>
that interest him. *Not* ones that might supposedly ease his passage  <br/>
into college (like basic math). Courses that interest him.<br/>
<br/>
Another is seeing that unschooled kids have the advantage of being  <br/>
able to create a transcript that looks like they&#39;ve been out living  <br/>
life and exploring the world, rather than a list of course titles  <br/>
matched with a letter that says little more than how well a child  <br/>
jumped through high school hoops.<br/>
<br/>
If *he* wants to go onto college, you might look into what colleges  <br/>
ask for that have policies for unschoolers (specifically). Not for  <br/>
you to control what he does, but to help you frame what he does into  <br/>
a narrative of what drives him.<br/>
<br/>
Wes Beach has a booklet on how to write transcripts - he has written  <br/>
hundreds of them for kids with all kinds of backgrounds, many of them  <br/>
unschooled.<br/>
<br/>
This is from the Homeschool Association of California:<br/>
<br/>
Opportunities After &quot;High School&quot;: Thoughts, Documents, Resources, by  <br/>
Wes Beach. Includes a number of transcripts Beach has written for his  <br/>
students; these transcripts can be used as models for homeschool  <br/>
transcripts. Also discusses community college enrollment; preparing  <br/>
for, choosing, and applying to four-year colleges; and opportunities  <br/>
other than formal academic study. A number of resource books are  <br/>
described. Available from HSC for $15: Make checks payable to Wes  <br/>
Beach, and send to HSC Book Order, 5520 Old San Jose Road, Soquel, CA  <br/>
95073. His talks can be arranged through HSC by emailing the teen  <br/>
adviser or at (831) 462-5867.<br/>
