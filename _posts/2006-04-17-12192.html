<div id="ygrps-yiv-974995121">&quot;I miss you Ren and your smelly kitchen!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
AAaaaaaw....I like my smelly kitchen too!:) And I&#39;ve been missing<br/>
everyone in P&#39;cola.....<br/>
<br/>
Chai is the standard &quot;friends are coming over&quot; tea. Yesterday it was<br/>
Raspberry Mojitos with fresh mint from my little herb bed. Yum.<br/>
<br/>
Food and good smells of cooking food are absolutely sacred arts in my<br/>
life. The smell of bread baking is my church, the gathering of herbs<br/>
my worship. <br/>
