<div id="ygrps-yiv-1077334456">3 years ago I bought these huge Learning Walls ( scenes in black and white on a huge white cardboard background in a variety of themes) and just found them again. I moved some furniture and they now take over almost 2 whole walls in one room of the house to be painted on and decorated and basically doing with as they please. My 3 y.o. has always loved painting on anything he can think of (Harold and the Purple Crayon is one of his favorite books), and I have had to come up with lots of creative ways to accommodate him and his dad&#39;s wishes at the same time, but found lots of ways to do so (a roll of paper suspended from a string from the top of the door, paint that can go on glass etc.).<br/>
And yes, I was vegetarian (even vegan) once and when I was pregnant with my first I started to have cravings for fish. I did not give in to them  thinking my now ex was going to be critical. My protein was always low, even though I had lots of beans and soy protein shakes etc. etc. and gained 45 pounds eating what I thought was healthy). I still feel bad about not listening to my child when in utero. When he was about 10 months old we were visiting a friend and I had cooked some fish for her. He just crawled over to her plate, grabbed it and gobbled it down. Since then I have never restricted any food I or my children would like to try. Sometimes we talk about how the different foods make us feel (Lucian called the peas they picked yesterday superpowerpellets, and said they make him feel strong, Doritos give him a headache and he does not want them anymore etc.). But also just if that is what we want to do - <br/>

LOL- I  am sure you are going to say that I should allow them to <br/>
paint my walls...  in which I will just sigh and hit delete)<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m smiling just remembering how much fun we had visiting Kelly&#39;s house <br/>
quite some time ago and painting the walls of the music room with our own art or <br/>
quotations.  The room looks awesome and I would love a room that my kids  and <br/>
friends had painted. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been following this whole thread and remembering our lives  before <br/>
unschooling when I used to say things like...&quot;We just  don&#39;t....... ......(fill in <br/>
the blank)   ----watch more than one hour  of TV a day,  allow guns in the ho<br/>
use or even watch things with any  violence,  eat at McDonalds!  Really, I said <br/>
and believed all  those things.<br/>
<br/>
I look at the close relationships I have with my kids who are now 15 and 18 <br/>
and I know it would not have been possible if I had continued to control  and <br/>
micro manage them with all my &quot;We just don&#39;ts&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They are so thoughtful and make such good decisions because they have been <br/>
trusted to decide what they eat, when they sleep, what they paint on the walls, <br/>
what they watch on TV and how they choose to spend their time. They learned <br/>
to  make their own decisions through seeing choices their parents made, <br/>
ongoing  discussions, and trial and error.   I have changed my vocabulary to  not <br/>
include the phrase.. &quot;We just don&#39;t...&quot; simply because it  limits possibilities <br/>
that might be amazing. <br/>
<br/>
I would hate to think I had missed those hours watching &quot;Friends, That 70&#39;s <br/>
Show and Family Guy with them because it was more than an hour a day.  And <br/>
the amazing potato guns that we made that shoot potatoes half way across  the <br/>
river.  And Pulp Fiction....we would have missed that too.  And  those late <br/>
night runs to get chocolate shakes just because I didn&#39;t like  McDonalds... would <br/>
have missed all that.  So many memories that we  share that make up the <br/>
kaleidoscope of our lives are just because I got rid  of &quot;We don&#39;t do that in our <br/>
family and replaced it with....&quot;Why Not?&quot;   And  &quot;Yes, let&#39;s find a way to make <br/>
that happen.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Just that simple thing made their lives so much bigger and all our lives so <br/>
much richer.<br/>
<br/>
I certainly would have thought it someone was crazy 7 years ago if  someone <br/>
had said &quot;Why not let your child paint on the walls&quot;     My journey from &quot;Why <br/>
not watch more than one hour of TV a day&quot; to   &quot;Why not paint on the walls&quot; <br/>
didn&#39;t happen  overnight .  However, I am reminded every day that changing  my <br/>
vocabulary helped me to change my parenting and the result has been  remarkable.<br/>
<br/>
Glad for this thread because it reminded me about Logan wanting to  paint on <br/>
some walls and thinking we could get the paint today.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2052416241">this reminds me...<br/>
<br/>
There is spray paint that can make a chalk board on the wall.  I<br/>
remember seeing it a few years back.<br/>
<br/>
I also saw white board paint at home depot a few months back.  you can<br/>
turn your whole wall into a dry erase board!<br/>

It gets better -- there&#39;s a kind of paint with metal in it you can put down<br/>
*under* the chalkboard paint and have a chalkboard you can use magnets on --<br/>
ANYWHERE!!<br/>
