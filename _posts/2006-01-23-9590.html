<div id="ygrps-yiv-1772717339">Yesterday I was talking to a friend about hermit crabs. We&#39;ve had  <br/>
several crabs, my son&#39;s favorite pets were a couple of two inch crabs  <br/>
named Hermie and Hermie (original, I know).<br/>
<br/>
One of the most interesting aspects of hermit crabs is the way they  <br/>
grow. As arthropods, they have an hard outer shell that they shed as  <br/>
they outgrow. As hermit crabs however, they differ from other crabs  <br/>
in that they do not have a complete exoskeleton. Instead, their  <br/>
elongated bodies are soft and must be protected by adopting abandoned  <br/>
snail shells. We&#39;ve spent many hours watching the crabs scuttle  <br/>
around, and laughed at their antics. We&#39;ve spent probably as much  <br/>
time concerned when they fell off the climbing wall we built, or  <br/>
feeding them, bathing them or watering their sponges.<br/>
<br/>
The twist comes in the fact that a predator cannot force a hermit  <br/>
crab out of it&#39;s shell. The tail has four evolved legs that grip onto  <br/>
the shell. If pulled, the hermit crab will be torn apart before it  <br/>
will allow itself to be removed from the shell. If you have a crab as  <br/>
a pet, you must provide shells for the crab to choose from. Because  <br/>
the hermit crab is so particular about his shell, you must provide  <br/>
several shells of various shapes and sizes from which he can pick.  <br/>
Then you step back and assume that nature will take it&#39;s course.<br/>
<br/>
The analogy can be made to unschooling. We cannot force our  <br/>
children&#39;s interest, we cannot force them to learn. We can respect  <br/>
them for who they are. We can place interesting resources and  <br/>
opportunities around them. We help, providing food and shelter, trust  <br/>
and love. Then we can watch with joy and excitement, and allow them  <br/>
to choose which shell they want to carry for this short while.</div>

If you expanded on this beautiful analogy, it would make a lovely<br/>

Anyone else want to finish it up, publish and make lots of money? LOL!<br/>
