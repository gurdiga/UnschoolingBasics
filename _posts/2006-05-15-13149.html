<div id="ygrps-yiv-2081359248">**For those with teens, have you seen changes in sleep patterns?  <br/>
Particularly if you have/had a morning person kid?**<br/>
<br/>
I have four kids, all of whom are either currently teens or past their teens. <br/>
<br/>
Patrick(14) has always been a night owl, starting in utero. When he hit <br/>
puberty he shifted even more to the wee hours. He *can* get up before noon, but <br/>
much prefers not to. He&#39;d probably be pretty happy with a job with overnight <br/>
hours, we&#39;ll have to wait and see till he&#39;s old enough to be legally employed past <br/>
ten pm. :)<br/>
<br/>
Ted(27) was a middle of the roader - falling asleep easily late evening, <br/>
waking easily in the morning. As a teen he became an extreme night owl for several <br/>
years, but has shifted to where he is quite uncomfortable when he&#39;s held jobs <br/>
with evening hours or overnight hours.<br/>
<br/>
Sarah(14) has always needed more sleep than anyone else, starting in utero. <br/>
She was occasionally so still for so long that I&#39;d poke at her to make sure she <br/>
was still alive in there. Meanwhile, her wombmate Patrick would be making so <br/>
much commotion it was clearly visible from across the room. &lt;g&gt; She&#39;s always <br/>
tended towards the night owl end of the spectrum, but would usually go to sleep <br/>
two hours or more before Patrick (and sleep a half hour to an hour after he <br/>
woke, as well.) At puberty she shifted farther into the night, staying up often <br/>
well past midnight. She is now a few years past puberty and is currently <br/>
experiencing another shift in sleeping pattern that she&#39;s finding painful. For <br/>
weeks she&#39;s been waking many hours earlier than her usual, leaving her feeling <br/>
groggy and &quot;off&quot; all day. She&#39;s trying to purposely shift her going to sleep <br/>
time earlier to compensate.<br/>
<br/>
Melissa(21) was a lark as a young child. She&#39;d bounce into my room as the sun <br/>
was rising, put her face into mine and sing &quot;Good morning mommy! Isn&#39;t it a <br/>
beautiful day!&quot; Sometimes she&#39;d pry open my eyelids if I tried to keep them <br/>
shut. :) It was really hard for me not to grouch back at her &quot;No, it is NOT a <br/>
beautiful day, it is too darn early to be up, go away!&quot; When she hit puberty she <br/>
shifted into a night owl routine - for her that meant she sometimes was still <br/>
awake at midnight. :) Currently she gets too little sleep by choice, staying <br/>
up late to talk to her night owl boyfriend, getting up very early for college <br/>
classes. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Both of my kids went into a later sleeping pattern at about 12 years old. Conor was more of a night person to begin with, and it&#39;s been more dramatic for him. He often pulls an all-nighter or stays up/sleeps for what seems like days. Qacei was a morning person until puberty started coming. Since then she *needs* to sleep in every morning. It&#39;s been a physical imperative for her for sure.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Emily is 13 and I can&#39;t really say since we have only been unschooling with<br/>
no limits to sleep for the past 3 years.  I know I fought her natural<br/>
rhythms all through her younger years because of societal norms.  I don&#39;t<br/>
think though that she has changed all that much, just been allowed to live<br/>
her own cycles.  She did say, though, the other day, &quot;I wish my friend would<br/>
do more role playing during the day.  Sometimes she wants to role play until<br/>
3 am when I want to go to bed.&quot;<br/>

 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve seen changes with both my children in the past several years.   Brenna <br/>
(16) and Logan (13) used to get up before 9:00 it seemed no matter how  late <br/>
they were up.  It was not uncommon for him to be awake by 7:00.  <br/>
 <br/>
Brenna had this gradual shift to sleeping later around 13 and 14 and would  <br/>
sleep till 11:00 unless she asked me to wake her up.  In the past  year, the <br/>
same thing has happened with Logan. He loves staying up till 1 or 2  a.m and <br/>
then will sleep till noon.<br/>
 <br/>
Brenna occasionally sleeps later in the morning now but more often will  <br/>
either set her alarm or ask me to wake her up by 9:00.  If she&#39;s done that  for <br/>
several days, she needs a day to sleep at least 12 hours.<br/>
 <br/>
Unschooling has allowed them to listen to their bodies and both have found  <br/>
sleep patterns that work best for them.  They know when they need to sleep  and <br/>
make decisions when to go to bed depending on what they have planned the  <br/>
next day.  <br/>
