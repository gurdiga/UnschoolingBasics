<div id="ygrps-yiv-2137427682">*even if it&#39;s simply sitting next to him reading while<br/>
he&#39;s watching a DVD on his laptop or playing a videogame (If it&#39;s a game<br/>
I can manage to be near without motion sickness - even catching motion<br/>
peripherally makes me uncomfortable with some games)*<br/>
<br/>
****I have this same issue. What I found helpful is to sit with my back to<br/>
the TV. I can be nearby and not vomiting :-) The kids know that games effect<br/>
me this way so they don&#39;t mind.<br/>
I can rub feet, read nearby, chat, listen to a rundown of what is happening,<br/>
serve food/drinks, or just be close.<br/>
<br/>
I use to just be in another room for certain games but through trail and<br/>
error I have found ways to connect. At times, they will stop playing a game<br/>
like that and ask me if I want to play another that doesn&#39;t make me sick. So<br/>
I can connect that way as well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-207027973">I usually sit in the kitchen and read  (PS3 is in the adjacent living<br/>
room, I can see them but not the screen) - I&#39;m close enough to hear and<br/>
converse without seeing the screen, and close enough as well to pop my<br/>
head in to see a short snippet of something DS and DH want to show me.<br/>
It works for us given the physical arrangement of stuff<br/>
