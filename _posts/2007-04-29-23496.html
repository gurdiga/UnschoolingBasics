<div id="ygrps-yiv-1682422419">I wrote this for my blog, but I&#39;m not sure I want to post it there - <br/>
I have a feeling it will sound snotty to my relatives invested in <br/>
public schooling. I figured y&#39;all would get a kick out of it, though:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m overcome with disgusting smuggness. Rayan is exploring German <br/>
and Italian, and Mo is exploring Spanish and Japanese, as a result <br/>
of the time they spend online and watching tv. So far neither one of <br/>
them are doing anything systematic, but they are both interested, <br/>
and exploring on their own. Ray found a German Runescape site and <br/>
learned a bunch of words very quickly - how to read them anyway. <br/>
George showed him Bable Fish, and that got him interested in <br/>
Italian, too. The boy who hates to read spent over an hour (that I <br/>
saw) looking up different words and expressions. Soon he&#39;ll be <br/>
cussing like a sailor in two new languages!<br/>
<br/>
Mo has been learning Spanish mostly through Dora, but also somewhat <br/>
through....oh I can think of the name of it. Some cartoon about <br/>
masked wrestling. Her accent is amazing to me - she can pronounce <br/>
some sounds that I can&#39;t wrap my tongue around at all. Japanese <br/>
she&#39;s started to learn via Pokemon, and other anime-cartoons. Makes <br/>
me wish we could afford Netflix and Dish, both, though. I&#39;d love to <br/>
rent more anime movies and series.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that&#39;s what I&#39;m gloating about today. Left to do, <br/>
essentially, whatever they choose, my kids are choosing to learn <br/>
about foreign languages. Ha! Take that public education! Take that <br/>
classical education! Take that tv and computer game skeptics!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2114306851">Right back at you, Meredith. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re going to go see the unsupportive relatives in FL (who include <br/>
schoolteachers) after the Rethinking Education conference over Labor <br/>
Day and also talking about &quot;worthless&quot; TV and video games. People <br/>
like us who are NOT being &quot;schoooled&quot; have TIME and energy to go off <br/>
on interesting tangents. But the relatives don&#39;t want to hear that.<br/>
<br/>
DD14 is researching Urdu, Kashmiri, Buruschevsky, and other <br/>
Pakistani/Indian languages, because I &quot;insulted&quot; the mountains she <br/>
made on SIMCITY III (because they weren&#39;t weathered enought). Well, <br/>
she showed me the Karakorums of northern Pakistan in NAT. GEO. and <br/>
they ARE pointy and not weathered. And now she has spent weeks <br/>
reading and thinking about the area and its culture. <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s been in Japanese classes for 5 months now, from Anime. And her <br/>
huge Lego buildings from the last four years are mostly from video <br/>
games (one was a UCLA building we saw). And we&#39;re almost finished <br/>
with the real Dante&#39;s Inferno - (she read those &quot;cheater&quot; Cliff <br/>
Notes at the bookstore). I read it to her while she plays WoW. We&#39;re <br/>
renting a cello (because some guy plays it on Blood+, an anime show) <br/>
and she is listening to cello music all the time. And the Stand <br/>
Alone Complex (more anime, very cerebral) has led her to psychology <br/>
textbooks and consciousness studies and a class at the local CC.<br/>
<br/>
But, who believes what she does? The family thinks we are wierd, <br/>
exaggerating (if I mention anything), and say that I&#39;ll be sorry, <br/>
because &quot;how can I do this to her?&quot; (I took her out of the public <br/>
school 4 years ago).<br/>
<br/>
Should be an interesting trip with me biting my tongue...<br/>
<br/>

Can you/she recommend any good, free online resources for foreign <br/>
languages in general? Ray&#39;s doing a good bit of dabbling right now - <br/>
last night it was Gaelic. He&#39;s been playing with Bable Fish and I&#39;ve <br/>
been helping him google different things. Last night he was even <br/>
bold enough to check out some university sites (that&#39;s a Big Deal, <br/>
for him). Is that the best bet for dabbling? I don&#39;t want him to <br/>
feel overwhelmed.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, would anyone know any good sites for downloading heavy <br/>
metal music in languages besides English? That might appeal to him, <br/>
especially if there was a translation available, so he could read <br/>
the lyrics. Yvonne (I think) sent me some links to....er, its been <br/>
awhile, I think it was Swedish metal, but they were just clips and <br/>
he wasn&#39;t interested in following up at the time - he was right out <br/>
of school and still pretty skeptical of anything from an adult. He&#39;s <br/>
sooooooooo much mellower now. <br/>

 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a great idea for a new weight loss program - visit people who<br/>
make you want to bite your tongue and you won&#39;t be biting into another<br/>
slice of cheesecake! LOL<br/>
 <br/>
On occasion, I&#39;ve been known to talk to the air or to my mashed potatoes<br/>
or whatever - that way I don&#39;t burst but I don&#39;t direct what I&#39;m saying<br/>
at anyone in particular. If someone overhears and maybe picks up a<br/>
tidbit, great. If they overhear and ask what I&#39;m talking about I can<br/>
just say &quot;oh, just talking to myself as usual&quot; and let it drop if it&#39;s<br/>
not going to lead to a positive situation. After visiting certain<br/>
relatives, hubby and I often just take a bit of time to have an Airing<br/>
of the Grievances (like at Festivus) so we can dump it all out and then<br/>
resume our lovely free lives.<br/>
