<div id="ygrps-yiv-2132508479">Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I have been unschooling, but after the discussions of the past few days I have spoken to him about the parenting side of things.  He has noticed I have changed my parenting - being more as you have all been speaking about putting the needs and relationship before the commands and demands type thing, and he has wanted to change more himself - he says he gets and agrees with the concept, however his father is somewhat ingrained in his mind - like alot of us.  <br/>
<br/>
Is there anything you would recommend I get him to read that will help without being to long.  And I would love something more indepth to continue growing in this way myself.  Any pointers would be great - books included :)  This is really a great way to learn and to parent I know that, our ds has never been to school or preschool so he has never known anything else, which Im thankful for :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,  Camille<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1422276079">Rue Kream&#39;s Parenting a Free Child is written in short Q&A type chapters<br/>
which is handy - just grab a chapter here and a chapter there, you can<br/>
even flip around and just pick stuff that jumps out at you without<br/>
having to read every prior chapter. Printing out selected articles from<br/>
Sandra Dodd&#39;s collection of writings on her website (it&#39;s not just her<br/>
writings - she&#39;s spent the last decade or more collecting helpful,<br/>
insightful articles and snippets from lots of people). There a links<br/>
there to other people&#39;s sites as well so it makes a nice central<br/>
starting point to finding short articles that you can read online or<br/>
print out to read later.<br/>
<br/>
A good practice might be when you (or your DH) are &quot;channeling&quot; your<br/>
parents, before you say or do anything, stop and think &quot;Why?&quot; just one<br/>
short word. &quot;Why am I about to say this?&quot; &quot;Why am I about to do this?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Why do I believe this is important?&quot; If there&#39;s not a good answer<br/>
besides &quot;That&#39;s the way I&#39;ve always done it, that&#39;s how mom and dad did<br/>
it&quot; then stop and think more. If it&#39;s along the lines of safety, for<br/>
example, then move forward &quot;why am I about to do this? Because I&#39;m<br/>
concerned that someone will get hurt.&quot; Okay, then you move to &quot;Is there<br/>
another way to give the kids the same type of thing if this thing is too<br/>
dangerous?&quot; or, to make it shorter &quot;How can I change (my thoughts, the<br/>
situation, etc) so that I can say Yes?&quot; Don&#39;t be afraid to apologize if<br/>
something jumps out of your mouth and then you go &quot;Doh! That was silly!&quot;<br/>
Mainstream thought is that parents have to be consistent, so if you say<br/>
No it has to stay NO, or if you impose a punishment you have to follow<br/>
through - even IF you realize two seconds later that it&#39;s pretty stupid<br/>
to do so. That&#39;s just nonsense (to be a bit blunt). You are allowed to<br/>
change your mind and even APOLOGIZE to your kids for saying or doing<br/>
something hurtful. Another tactic that some find useful is to pause and<br/>
think &quot;Would I say/do this to my spouse/best friend?&quot; If not, don&#39;t do<br/>
it to your kids.<br/>

You might try Alfie Kohn&#39;s DVD, Unconditional Parenting. Sometimes people find it easier to watch something, than to read.<br/>

Other than that, I second the recommendation for Parenting a Free Child. It&#39;s a very easy question & answer format, you don&#39;t have to read the whole thing all at once to get a lot out of it.<br/>

<br/>
I like Scott Noelle&#39;s Daily Groove emails. They&#39;re free. <br/>
www.enjoyparenting.com/dailygroove<br/>
I like that they keep showing up. If the title grabs me I read it, if not, sometimes not. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I forward one to my husband. It&#39;s nice to be able to say, &quot;Hey, I got this today and I thought it was interesting&quot; instead of &quot;That thing you did last night really bugged me so I did research and found this for you to read.&quot; ;) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1349117396">As an initially resistant Dad, I found a few thinsg helpful. First, Ginger got a copy of Rue&#39;s book (Parenting a Free Child) and placed that in my reading room (aka our upstairs bathroom), periodically moving it to the front of the Business Weeks and Hockey News&#39;s that I placed in front of it. She also would send me specific brief links from Joyce Fetteroll&#39;s website (and others - &quot;brief &quot;is the key point here) to my work email address so I could look at them in the relative privacy of work  - it made it easier to not have to &quot;learn&quot; about unschooling while sitting in an unschooling house with unschoolers. <br/>
<br/>
Most critically, she took the time to understand my fears and concerns without refuting them or trying to convince me. She felt that she needed to understand the totality of my resistance, and she knew how important it was for me to simply be heard. <br/>
<br/>
And the, she took the biggets step of all and booked non-refundable tickets to our first conference :-)<br/>

Very thankful to have such a helpful group and that you took the time.  Also great seeing a Dad here too Jeff :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-958074322">I would recommend Non-Violent Communication by Marshall Rosenberg.  I<br/>
haven&#39;t read it yet but I took a workshop from one of his followers<br/>
and it is great stuff.<br/>
 His website is cnvc.org.   Alfie Kohn&#39;s video is a good one too.  He has a<br/>
book by the same name, Unconditional Parenting, and several others.  Take a<br/>
look at his website too alfiekohn.org.  There is a video clip about this as<br/>
well as a few articles that you can download/print - look for general<br/>
interest and parenting categories.  I don&#39;t know if this fits the bill.<br/>
 Maybe perusing the websites will fuel the flames for longer, more in depth<br/>
reading?<br/>
