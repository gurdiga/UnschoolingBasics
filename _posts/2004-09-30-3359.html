<div id="ygrps-yiv-1804937290">hi there...<br/>
i&#39;m from new zealand and live on an organic farm in south india..<br/>
i&#39;ve always homeschooled and worried that we don&#39;t do <br/>
enough,tried to defend my decision to family , friends <br/>
etc......fought with my kids to do schoolwork!<br/>
what a relief to discover unschooling!! <br/>
i will probably have some pretty basic questions at first....<br/>
happy to be here....<br/>
