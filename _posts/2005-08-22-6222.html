<div id="ygrps-yiv-1232202454">As an unschooler I&#39;ve made an effort to see the fun and *learning* <br/>
in every moment.  Lately, Adrian has had a few &quot;funny&quot; moments.  I <br/>
thought some of you may find them humorous as well, any educational <br/>
gain is a bi-product.  :)  <br/>
<br/>
Moment #1 - Adrian accompanied me on my vending machine route last <br/>
week.  I&#39;ve been in this habit of regularly checking his hair and <br/>
looking in his ears, one time I found a finger nail...go figure.  <br/>
Well, this time I just happened to look over while we were at a red <br/>
light and noticed that there was something completely blocking his <br/>
ear canal.  When we got home I looked further and could not figure <br/>
what it could be.  <br/>
<br/>
This quickly turned into a &quot;science experiment&quot;.  First we tried <br/>
getting it to move using peroxide.  The theory was the bubbles would <br/>
help it move to the entrance of the ear canal.  Well, It did move, <br/>
but every time I tried to grab the object it would fall back in the <br/>
ear.  <br/>
<br/>
After several attmpts, and not wanting to cause injury, we moved on <br/>
to asking an &quot;expert&quot;.  That expert would be my good friend of 20+ <br/>
years who is a mother of six and someone we refer to when in need of <br/>
home remedies.  Our expert suggested that we flush the ear with <br/>
water, as that is what would be done in a doctor&#39;s office.  <br/>
<br/>
We used a sqeezable bulb and squirted warm water into the ear as he <br/>
leaned over the sink.  It worked.  Guess what came out?  A LEMON <br/>
SEED!  Neither of us are quite certain as to how it got in his ear.  <br/>
He is 11 years old and knows the &quot;dangers&quot; of inserting foreign <br/>
objects into ears.  <br/>
<br/>
After further research we  discovered that a much younger child at <br/>
one time had stuck an orange seed up his nose so far and for so long <br/>
that it actually sprouted.  AND, we also discovered that Battleship <br/>
pieces inserted into each ear canal at age three and discovered at <br/>
age nine do no real damage to one&#39;s ears.<br/>
<br/>
Moment #2 - This could be considered a follow up &quot;experiment&quot; to <br/>
an &quot;experiment&quot; that took place a few years ago.  Adrian is very <br/>
fond of pepperoncini peppers and eats them on a regular basis.  A <br/>
few years ago he discovered that pepper juice in one&#39;s eye is VERY <br/>
painful.  The easiest remedy is to run to the nearest swimming pool <br/>
and open your eyes under water for several minutes.  <br/>
<br/>
Just yesterday in the follow up &quot;experiment&quot; it was discovered that <br/>
pepper juice up the nose is not quite as painful as pepper juice in <br/>
the eye.  This is not to say that it is not painful, as it very well <br/>
is.  The easiest remedy discovered is to run to the nearest sink.  <br/>
Quickly run warm water, place your nostrils in the running water and <br/>
suck the water into your nose.  Blow the water out your nose.  <br/>
Repeat until pain is relieved.<br/>
<br/>
The above &quot;experiments&quot; were unplanned.  There was no curriculum <br/>
involved, and were spontaneous events that occured through <br/>
strewing.  No one was permanently injured, and we have all had a few <br/>
good laughs.  Upon close examination there was several areas of <br/>
learning covered if one was so inclined to categorize the events.  <br/>
You wouldn&#39;t, or rather you just may, believe the conversations that <br/>
have come of these events.  See...learning really does occur in <br/>
everyday life.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Having fun in the moment...<br/>
