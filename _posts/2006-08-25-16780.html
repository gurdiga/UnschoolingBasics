<div id="ygrps-yiv-2101324093">~~~~The essence of writing occurs in your head. The medium doesn&#39;t<br/>
matter so much.<br/>
<br/>
Johanna this is BEAUTIFUL!!!~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
I AGREE!! I had cut that part, to post about and then read your<br/>
response Michelle. <br/>
<br/>
Quality writing bubbles up from quality experiences. The more a person<br/>
experiences of LIFE, of emotions, of interesting memories, the more<br/>
fodder they have for writing. So filling our children with great<br/>
memories and experiences is the very BEST way to help them be great at<br/>
anything in life...that&#39;s it. The magic formula. Poof!<br/>
<br/>
Writing isn&#39;t the act of pen on paper, unless you want it to be.<br/>
Writing is formulating your thoughts and feelings and finding a way to<br/>
communicate them to other humans. I agree with Johanna, that the<br/>
essence of writing is in your head (and heart).<br/>
<br/>
Any kind of coercion has the potential to turn a person off to the<br/>
medium. That&#39;s not what unschoolers want. We want passionate children<br/>
that feel free to be supported in whatever they choose to<br/>
experience/create/learn about. Forcing writing does not lead to great<br/>
writing. Creating a life worth living CAN (and often does) lead to<br/>
great writing.......but only if the person enjoys expressing<br/>
themselves in that medium.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-992070584">I wanted to also talk about this subject, because we&#39;ve been  <br/>
experiencing some of this lately. Sam is a story teller, he is so  <br/>
amazing. He can create fantastical amazing plots and subplots, and  <br/>
without much forethought, an amazing end. He adds visual imagery that  <br/>
is quite specific, and changes his voice to a deep lyrical chant  <br/>
(almost, as deep and lyrical as a 5yo can get, i guess) I enjoyed his  <br/>
stories so much that I started writing them down. He seemed okay with  <br/>
it for a while, but then one day took my face in both his hands and  <br/>
came very close. &quot;Just LISTEN to me, just hear my story.&quot; Dictation  <br/>
is not always what it&#39;s cracked up to be either. We&#39;re compromising,  <br/>
I listen, and sometimes he says I may write them down as we go, and  <br/>
sometimes I can ask him later for specifics if I&#39;m trying to recall  <br/>
certain details. My favorite so far is &quot;The Golden Bean&quot;, in which a  <br/>
cowboy  turns into a dragon with the aid of  aforementioned bean.<br/>
