filters as though it has some significant text.<br/>
<br/>
It was generated by taking random bits from Asimov&#39;s Foundation  <br/>
series. (Perhaps it&#39;s in the public domain?) I suspect every email  <br/>
has different text. That way there isn&#39;t a pattern for the filters to  <br/>
pick up on. (Not strictly true since the names in it are unique, but  <br/>
they&#39;re looking for  quick and dirty rather than perfect.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve collected bits of spam nonsense. Yes, I&#39;m weird ;-)<br/>

Either Google&#39;s or Altavista&#39;s translation service would do a better job.<br/>
Though not much better.  :-)<br/>
