<div id="ygrps-yiv-228904826">For once I am not posting for advice, but rather to update on how I am doing with the advice and suggestions you have all given me.  Looking at things through unschooling eyes is starting to become more automatic.  For instance, today on our way home my younger dd said she wanted a lolipop.  I had gotten her one earlier at the bank and her older sister was having hers.  I explained she already had hers but she insisted she wanted another one. So I said, &quot;what color will you get next time?&quot;  We talked about different colors and flavors and which were our favorite and low and behold the tantrum ended.  I also took her to the park while the older one was at art class. When it was time to pick my older dd up I made a game of catch Mommy and ran to the car with my younger dd laughing and chasing behind me.  We still have tantrums, but I am finding that if I just sit back, relax and try to turn the situation into something fun it isn&#39;t so bad.  I am far from perfecting this technique, but at least I am finally catching on.  <br/>

Thanks,<br/>
