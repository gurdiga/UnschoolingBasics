<div id="ygrps-yiv-755577271">Hi.  I&#39;m Deb, wife to Jeff and mom to Sarah (8.5) and Ethan (4). <br/>
We&#39;re new to the group and I wanted to say &quot;hi&quot; before I start<br/>
lurking.  :) Neither of our children has been to school, though we&#39;ve<br/>
tried a variety of approaches for learning at home.  We&#39;ve been trying<br/>
to unschool, off an on, for a while now.  Kids love it.  Dad&#39;s okay<br/>
with it.  I&#39;m scared to really commit to it.  I&#39;m hoping this group<br/>
will be a support to help me really understand how the unschool in the<br/>
best way for our family.  Parenting issues/positive<br/>
parenting/discipline seem to be interwoven with the unschooling issue,<br/>
at least for us.  Sarah, at 8.5yo, is very social, intelligent,<br/>
strong-willed and opinionated, loves to read, ride her bike and lately<br/>
she&#39;s discovered Pokemon. She also loves to take photos, but not<br/>
necessarily learn about cameras or how they work.  Ethan, at 4yo., is<br/>
not as social but also strong-willed.  He likes to play with trucks,<br/>
trains, cars and in any dirt or mud he can find.  He also loves to<br/>
read, a skill he picked up on his own when he was 3.  Drawing mazes is<br/>
now his passion, along with riding his new bike and playing on the<br/>
computer.  I look forward to learning from all of you!  Deb in N. Texas :)</div>
