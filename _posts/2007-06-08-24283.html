<div id="ygrps-yiv-171117326">Does anyone have kids with special dietary needs? My two kiddos are on<br/>
a gfcf diet and I&#39;m struggling with how to handle their access to the<br/>
special foods we buy each week because they are *so* darn expensive<br/>
that we can&#39;t afford to buy all that they would prefer to eat each<br/>
week.<br/>
<br/>
So... should I just buy whatever we can afford, not limit it at all<br/>
and then when it&#39;s gone it&#39;s gone? My concern (the hump I haven&#39;t been<br/>
able to get over) is that it means this specialty food is usually<br/>
consumed within the first 2-3 days which leaves no bread (or other<br/>
grain items like muffins, pancakes, cookies, etc) for the rest of the<br/>
week. This leaves them eating protein, veggies, and fruit for the<br/>
remaining 4-5 days and while I realize that sounds like a strange<br/>
thing to be concerned about, lol, both kids need lots of carbs in<br/>
their diet or they get irritable pretty quickly and tend to &quot;search&quot;<br/>
for food all day as if they aren&#39;t satisfied, even after eating (which<br/>
they might not be if the meal was lacking in carbs).<br/>
<br/>
I also think this has set up a cycle of binging and then doing without<br/>
which leads to binging again the next time the food&#39;s available and<br/>
then doing without again for many days. I have a feeling that if we<br/>
could afford to fill the house with an abundant supply, they would<br/>
eventually relax and not feel the urge to eat it all up in 2 days<br/>
flat. I see that this is the hording thing that happens when kids (and<br/>
adults) feel like they might not get more. Unfortunately, we can&#39;t<br/>
afford to buy this much. I&#39;m thinking that if, day after day, there<br/>
was some available they might realize there will always be more<br/>
tomorrow and this would help them relax. Right now it&#39;s binge,<br/>
nothing, binge, nothing. This is the only food they do this with btw,<br/>
but of course they are not limited in quantity on any other items,<br/>
either.<br/>
<br/>
What to do? While I don&#39;t want to set restrictions or limits, I&#39;m<br/>
seeing that it might be necessary to plan a certain allotment for each<br/>
day and make that available each morning and then not set restrictions<br/>
or limits on when/where/how they eat it. But this is still restricting<br/>
in a sense, but they don&#39;t have access to the whole supply in the<br/>
house, so I&#39;m just not sure how to make peace with this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1857603361">we did gfcf for a little while but it just wasnt seeming to help my son and you are right it is soooo expensive. <br/>
   <br/>
  Do you buy premade stuff and mixes ? If so buying bulf flours ...rice, buckwheat, etc and making your own things could be an option to get more food for a lower cost. <br/>
   <br/>
  Also not saying cut out all of say the tapioca, brown rice ect bread but you can get 2-3 packages of plain rice cakes for the cost of 1 loaf of pre-made bread. The rice spaghetti is high but cheap compared to a lot of other things ..and a good source of carbs. Potato chips, baked potatoes toped with a variety of things , hash browns and french fries. You can get a jar of loose popcorn for like $2 and a microwave popping bowl..then use ghee or a bit of the fleshmans light instead of butter...most mcormic seasonings are gfcf so a good way to experiemnt with different flavorings for the popcorn. <br/>
   <br/>
  www.allergygrocer.com  may have better prices than those charged at local health food stores if you havent tried it before.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Schuyler,<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a great site. We actually do bake quite a bit to keep costs<br/>
down. Buying a pack of 5 cookies in the specialty food store is $3.99<br/>
(ridiculous). It IS cheaper to make certain things at home but<br/>
unfortunately, even the alternative flour and other ingredients needed<br/>
are still about 3-5 times more expensive than their regular<br/>
counterparts, mostly because they are uncommon and not purchased by<br/>
lots of people.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone needs to have experience with this specific diet<br/>
to offer their thoughts on this (although I appreciate you going to<br/>
the trouble to look it up). I know there are families dealing with<br/>
many types of diets that require expensive foods. Just wondering how<br/>
to meet their needs within our budget. Traditional thinking says to<br/>
limit and restrict. Right now they have free access to their special<br/>
foods but that&#39;s not working well because the supply runs out pretty<br/>
fast and it&#39;s set up an unhealthy pattern.<br/>

the prices weren&#39;t phenomenal. It&#39;s been a few years so I&#39;ll check it<br/>
out again. Yes, I suppose we could find other sources of (cheaper)<br/>
carbs for them. They love baked sweet potatoes and speaking of<br/>
popcorn, I made a bunch today at the suggestion of the kids  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-431451763">We have a GF kid, a CF kid and a corn-free kid. We don&#39;t buy the specialty stuff except for <br/>
one or two packages. One, they go bad quite quickly, two, they usually taste funny and <br/>
three, they are very expensive. We also do not buy the ingredients at the health food store, <br/>
where rice flour is $5 a pound. We buy it at a Chinese supermarket,(its an hour drive from <br/>
here but worth it), where it&#39;s 50¢ for two pounds. We also buy rice noodles there,  they are <br/>
usually 75¢ a pound. For the most part, we don&#39;t eat breads. We usually don&#39;t eat pasta <br/>
either, but have a lot of rice, mashed potatoes or sweet potato cubes under our sauces.  <br/>
Sandwiches are just as good separated on the plate, or wrapped in a warm corn tortilla, <br/>
and usually taste better than the rice bread.<br/>
Because we buy rice flour, tapioca starch and whatever else we need there, we save a lot of <br/>
money and make our own muffins, cookies, etc. We also save a fortune on not buying <br/>
regular snack foods, that are not safe. So I feel pretty good about buying snacks that are <br/>
safe because of all the money we have saved in not buying Oreo&#39;s, doritos, etc. You can <br/>
buy a lot of chips, a LOT of frito lays stuff is GFCF. that&#39;s about as carby as it gets. There&#39;s <br/>
a website that&#39;s good for what you can buy, alot of it is specialty, but alot not. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.tacanow.com/foodlist.htm">http://www.tacanow.com/foodlist.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
anyway, kids get a lot of carbs from fruits and veggies, my kids do seek snack foods <br/>
because they fulfill a niche, their sweet tooth and salty tongue etc etc. :-) That regular <br/>
food just does NOT hit. <br/>

hi, Susan! could you budget their items *with* them, and menu plan too,  with <br/>
them? Possibly cook/bake/make some items, rather than purchasing them  <br/>
pre-made? Also, do you have a Trader Joe&#39;s near you? The costs there are a  pretty <br/>
good and have a fair amount of both gf and cf items _www.traderjoes.com_ <br/>
(http://www.traderjoes.com)  just in case. I am just  thinking that the added <br/>
participation might help slow the binge cycle you&#39;re  concerned about. and forgive <br/>
me please if I said anything that has been said or  that is useless, I&#39;m too <br/>
new to know many here, yet :) <br/>

 </span></blockquote>You touched on one of the downfalls of living in a rural area - we<br/>
don&#39;t have stores like Trader Joe&#39;s or Whole Foods Market (which I<br/>
love to shop at when I&#39;m visiting other areas). The nearest is about 2<br/>
hrs away. We are fortunate to have *any* specialty stores here, so for<br/>
that I&#39;m thankful, but they are very pricey. I might start shopping<br/>
online again.<br/>
<br/>
I have been giving this food issue a lot of thought and I think I&#39;m<br/>
going to be able to work it out. Involving the kids in the budgeting &<br/>
menu planning is a great idea (I don&#39;t know why this it never occurred<br/>
to me).<br/>

I just started doing this with my sons. Not because of a special diet <br/>
per se but to save money, make things last longer as well as be more <br/>
nutritious than the snacks we were buying. They have all had a great <br/>
time and it has inspired my  sons to learn more about the kitchen, <br/>
measuring, what different ingredients they can use etc. He likes to bake <br/>
once or twice a week now. I will be stocking up on bread ingredients now <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1684783286">Re: budgeting food. A related problem that we have is this: I buy some treats that one of 3 kids requested.  Recently it has been twinkies, Hi-C juice boxes, etc.  And the 13 yo consumes all of it in 1-2 days, distressing the other kids.  Buying more may sometimes be possible but the same thing happens again.  Also, I sometimes don&#39;t have the time (for a few days) or the $$ to immediately buy more.  The 13yo has so far been immune to discussions regarding the fairness of this. I did mention once an amount of ginger ale that seemed fair for him to have but he had all of it.  We are still deschooling...maybe it&#39;s just that.  I have planned a family meeting to allow all of us to discuss these and other concerns.  But so far the only thing I&#39;ve really found it makes me want to do is not buy the stuff (although mostly I still do).  We do cook together when we can, but these are specially requested items.  Any ideas how to balance this while recognizing everybody&#39;s needs? And not<br/>
 making the 13yo seem selfish.  He really isn&#39;t. Cameron<br/>

names on foods or storing them on separate shelves? In our house Mo <br/>
has a shelf in the pantry where she sometimes stores foods and Ray <br/>
keeps some snacks in his room. They are both willing to share their <br/>
treats when asked. <br/>
<br/>
Sharing consumables can be really challenging - there&#39;s something <br/>
unsettling about having an expectation of eating or using something <br/>
only to find *someone else* has eaten or used the last of whatever-<br/>
it-is. George and Mo both tend to binge on cookies when they think <br/>
the other is going to &quot;get&quot; the last - I call it &quot;competitive <br/>
eating&quot;. Ray&#39;s less likely to do this, and I don&#39;t do it at all, so <br/>
its not *just* a matter of un/deschooling. There&#39;s some personality <br/>
issues involved. <br/>

count, no less) boxes into it, he decided he didn&#39;t want Twix bars<br/>
very often. Funny thing.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t always have the money for tons of snacky stuff. Last night at<br/>
the store, Jalen and Sierra were making many requests.....I finally<br/>
reminded them that I needed to buy meal items for everyone and they<br/>
were like &quot;OH yeah, that&#39;s fine&quot;. They trust I will buy them the foods<br/>
they want, so when we need to watch the money it makes sense to them.<br/>
The older they get, the easier that part is. Small children just can&#39;t<br/>
understand budget needs very well.<br/>
<br/>
Can you buy the 13 year old some items just for him? I found that if<br/>
one child is really consuming a lot, and has a higher need for certain<br/>
items, it helps to provide them with some of their own foods they can<br/>
stash somewhere away from communal areas. Jared absolutely LOVES<br/>
tapioca pudding and likes to have his own tub.<br/>
<br/>
We give him space in the mini-fridge in the basement (dh&#39;s little<br/>
stash) so nobody gets into his tapioca.:)  Once a child knows they&#39;ll<br/>
have access to the foods they really want, it tends to smooth out some<br/>
of the intense desire.<br/>
<br/>
His needs are just different than the other kids, so maybe providing<br/>
him with his own stash will help?  It will probably be a short lived<br/>
thing. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-480450976">-I am really glad that this topic has come up!   I have been a little<br/>
concerned/disturbed (?) by my kids writing their names on things in<br/>
the refrigerator... mostly soft drinks lately.   We rarely buy it and<br/>
what led to them writing their names on it was that they would put one<br/>
in the fridge to chill then come back and someone else has taken it<br/>
not realizing someone had put it in for themselves!   We did make a<br/>
&quot;rule of consideration&quot; (our own little coined phrase for when rules<br/>
are necessary for harmony)  that if they take out a bottled water they<br/>
should make sure to put in a few more for others to have a cold one<br/>
when they need it.     At any rate my husband bought a large variety<br/>
box of Jone&#39;s Sodas at Sam&#39;s ...because the kids each wanted to try<br/>
several flavors they wrote their names on the bottles in the fridge. <br/>
At first it struck me as somewhat selfish.  Later I saw my 5 yr old<br/>
gladly give his 12 yr old sister one he had already claimed that she<br/>
decided she might like to try but found there were no more of that<br/>
flavor.  They have been gladly giving each other a taste of ones they<br/>
found especially yummy that their siblings didn&#39;t think they would<br/>
like but wanted to have a taste later.    <br/>
We also have food allergies (our 5 yr old) so I do buy specific things<br/>
for him that can be expensive.   So far I haven&#39;t had to limit<br/>
anything because the others are rarely interested in his Rice Dream<br/>
ice cream or his Rice Dream rice milk.     They do occasionally have a<br/>
few of his cookies or other things.   In our case I have managed to<br/>
find recipes for most things so that I can make them more cheaply and<br/>
have them readily available in whatever amounts we need them.     A<br/>
few times I have come across a teen happily munching on the<br/>
dairy/wheat free cookies and had a moment of panic (because of the<br/>
expense and thinking of the 5 yr olds face when others are having<br/>
regular cookies and his are gone!)  usually I just remind them that<br/>
those are the dairy/wheat free ones and ask that they make sure they<br/>
leave some for their brother.   Most of the time they hadn&#39;t realized<br/>
they were the special cookies and immediately switch to regular ones.<br/>
  Sometimes they remark that they like those better and I make sure I<br/>
buy a larger amount the next time!    <br/>
Thanks for all the great reassuring discussion on this topic!   I<br/>
especially feel better about the writing names on things!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1875670490">I wonder if it would be a cheap option to bake some gfcf treats for them on<br/>
a weekly basis.  Not to say you ought to stop buying their favorites but<br/>
maybe some home made things could help stretch the grocery budget (and the<br/>
carb rich foods) to last the whole week.  I found this cookbook on line -<br/>
it&#39;s pretty expensive but maybe you already have some resources?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1315869649">***What to do? While I don&#39;t want to set restrictions or limits, I&#39;m<br/>
seeing that it might be necessary to plan a certain allotment for each<br/>
day and make that available each morning and then not set restrictions<br/>
or limits on when/where/how they eat it. But this is still restricting<br/>
in a sense, but they don&#39;t have access to the whole supply in the<br/>
house, so I&#39;m just not sure how to make peace with this.***<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve already set limits by restricting their diets and now you&#39;re asking<br/>
about ideas for restricting allowed foods.<br/>
<br/>
If you think this diet is good for them then it&#39;s your responsibility to<br/>
make the diet you chose for them available.  Our kids don&#39;t have a<br/>
responsibility to be only as hungry as we want them or can afford for them<br/>
to be.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Are you willing to rethink the diet issue?   Are typically reported benefits<br/>
of this diet going to help your kids to a degree that will make the<br/>
potential emotional food related issues worth the risk?   How do your kids<br/>
feel about being on the diet?   If your kids are willingly on the diet they<br/>
might have ideas about making things stretch.   If your kids don&#39;t have the <br/>
option of quitting the diet then<br/>
it wouldn&#39;t be right to ask them for ideas about further limiting their <br/>
foods.   (You don&#39;t have to share more information<br/>
with us than you want... I&#39;m just saying getting the kids to agree to <br/>
limiting foods if they really don&#39;t have a choice about being<br/>
on the diet is not really agreement or choice.)<br/>
<br/>
I only read briefly about this diet and it seems there is one study that <br/>
showed some<br/>
benefit to kids and that study isn&#39;t widely supported.  I don&#39;t believe <br/>
there has to be scientific proof a<br/>
thing is beneficial for it to be so.   The benefits of unschooling are not<br/>
scientifically proven and the reports of benefits come from parents relating<br/>
their experiences.  (much like the gfcf diet, it seems)    The difference is<br/>
unschooling is not about restricting and limiting kids but about creating a<br/>
life of abundance and the diet is restrictive and limiting.<br/>
<br/>
When Dylan was first diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis we looked at the<br/>
information about diet.  The benefits of a restricted diet were not<br/>
conclusive and Dylan decided it wasn&#39;t worth it to him to give up some of<br/>
the things he loved for a &quot;possible&quot; benefit.    Dylan had already chosen a<br/>
primarily vegan diet (he occasionally eats honey) for himself, for<br/>
ethical reasons but was not willing to further limit his diet for<br/>
unproven potential health benefits.   It&#39;s my belief (unproven by scientific<br/>
study &lt;g&gt;) that my support of Dylan&#39;s choices has been more beneficial to<br/>
his overall health than a diet would have been and especially if the diet<br/>
was not something he chose for himself.<br/>
<br/>
If the diet stays:<br/>
Can you make a deal with your supplier to buy case loads of favorite foods <br/>
at a better price?<br/>
Can you buy bulk amounts at the best price of the ingredients to make their<br/>
favorite things?<br/>
A quick search showed a fifty pound bag of rice flour at Amazon ($4.50<br/>
shipping) for  $56.00.    That&#39;s about fifteen dollars more than a fifty<br/>
pound bag of organic wheat flour.   Fifteen dollars isn&#39;t that much (but <br/>
I&#39;ve also lived through<br/>
times when fifteen dollars was nearly impossible to come by)   Start a coop <br/>
and buy two hundred pounds<br/>
at a time and see what kind of deal your health food store or your local<br/>
Asian market can make you.   Can you grind your own rice flour?<br/>
<br/>
Where in your budget can you make changes to increase money available for<br/>
food?   Can you drop magazine subscriptions?  Can you cut out services you<br/>
now pay for?  Can you trade out for services?  (an example might be cleaning<br/>
the Karate Dojo in exchange for kid&#39;s lessons.)   Can you get a part time<br/>
job?   Handyman or clean or mow lawns for extra cash?<br/>
<br/>
Food is already an issue for them.    You&#39;ve linked food to behavior and<br/>
you&#39;ve restricted some foods.  They likely already feel needy.  Any further<br/>
restricting you do could create more need.  You can either let them decide<br/>
whether it&#39;s worth it or decide for them.   If you decide for them and if<br/>
you choose to limit the amounts of their favorite allowed foods for budget<br/>
sake you may not be able to reconcile it with the unschooling philosophy.<br/>
It&#39;s not always easy, but it&#39;s always worth thinking about. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1259171542">Hi Deb,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your reply. It&#39;s given me lots of &quot;food for thought&quot;. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If you think this diet is good for them then it&#39;s your responsibility to<br/>
&gt; make the diet you chose for them available.  Our kids don&#39;t have a<br/>
&gt; responsibility to be only as hungry as we want them or can afford for them<br/>
&gt; to be.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I total agree with that point. It&#39;s *my* responsibility to make sure<br/>
they have what they need and of course I would never let them walk<br/>
around the house starving! I want to emphasize that week to week they<br/>
*are* getting enough to eat nutritionally and they&#39;re in excellent<br/>
physical health. As someone else pointed out, there are carbs in<br/>
vegetables and fruits and they eat lots of those, so it may not be a<br/>
carb issue as I originally thought.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe they&#39;re grazers and need to eat smaller portions more frequently<br/>
throughout the day. They may need more fats since we tend to avoid<br/>
butter substitutes because of trans fats and fish/seafood because of<br/>
mercury levels. I&#39;m going to try to find alternate sources of<br/>
omega-3/6 oils and other beneficial fats. I really like the monkey<br/>
platter idea I read about on Sandra&#39;s site. I realize it is my<br/>
responsibility to help them figure out what their needs are and I&#39;ve<br/>
been thinking a lot about this stuff. The main issue at hand is<br/>
finding a way to provide them with enough of the *specific* foods they<br/>
desire to eat.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Are you willing to rethink the diet issue? Are typically reported benefits<br/>
&gt; of this diet going to help your kids to a degree that will make the<br/>
&gt; potential emotional food related issues worth the risk?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It has *very* greatly improved their quality of life and resolved<br/>
several dozen health issues. I realize this diet doesn&#39;t work for<br/>
everyone and that some people see little, if any, improvement. We&#39;re<br/>
fortunate in that regard because it&#39;s worked amazingly well for our<br/>
kids. Being free of gluten & casein has made dramatic differences in<br/>
their lives. Their improvements have absolutely floored their doctors<br/>
and even prompted a research study. The diet isn&#39;t something we&#39;ve<br/>
randomly and mindlessly decided to force upon them. They both have<br/>
celiac disease and *must* be gluten free. They also have a milk<br/>
allergy as well, so being both gf and cf is working well for them.<br/>
It&#39;s the way they will eat for life, it&#39;s what they will have to live<br/>
with always.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How do your kids<br/>
&gt; feel about being on the diet?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They have been on this diet for most of their lives so it is what<br/>
they&#39;re used to and they really enjoy their foods. It is as normal to<br/>
them as it is for my mom to avoid chocolate because she is allergic.<br/>
It&#39;s just a fact of life for them, like people who need to avoid<br/>
peanuts or strawberries or any other food that seriously affects a<br/>
person&#39;s health and well being. The diet itself is not an area of<br/>
contention or disagreement with the kids. However, I know they would<br/>
be happier with having more of certain foods they really like and tend<br/>
to crave, and I am trying to find a way to give them that.<br/>
<br/>
97% of the time the kids don&#39;t mind their diet. The other 3% are those<br/>
times when they see something they can&#39;t have, like if we are at<br/>
someone&#39;s house and someone (unexpectedly) pulls a big delicious<br/>
looking chocolate cake out of the fridge and the kids wish they could<br/>
have some. We try to prepare for most situations by making sure we<br/>
have their gfcf equivalent on hand for them, but there are times when<br/>
we&#39;re taken by surprise. But there are also (and increasingly more<br/>
often) times when they barely notice a plate of regular cookies and<br/>
don&#39;t give a second glance to someone eating a cheesy pizza.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The difference is<br/>
&gt; unschooling is not about restricting and limiting kids but about creating a<br/>
&gt; life of abundance and the diet is restrictive and limiting.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I hope you&#39;re not saying that families with kids that must be on<br/>
special diets cannot also be unschoolers.  :)    It would be so much<br/>
easier if they did not have these special dietary needs. It would be<br/>
considerably less difficult (and less expensive) to shop for food, we<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have to worry about them getting exposed to<br/>
cross-contamination, we wouldn&#39;t have to pack up their foods every<br/>
time we leave the house, etc. Although I do see everything we do as a<br/>
choice, even if all the available options are difficult, and despite<br/>
all these challenges, knowing what we know now, I feel it would be<br/>
irresponsible and dangerous to give them gluten & dairy foods.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It&#39;s my belief (unproven by scientific<br/>
&gt; study &lt;g&gt;) that my support of Dylan&#39;s choices has been more beneficial to<br/>
&gt; his overall health than a diet would have been and especially if the diet<br/>
&gt; was not something he chose for himself.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I totally understand that reasoning and under different circumstances<br/>
we might do the same thing! My kids were very young when they went<br/>
gfcf, but they &quot;spoke out&quot; about their needs the only way they could.<br/>
My son was miserable and cried nearly all the time, didn&#39;t want to be<br/>
touched (his skin was extremely sensitive) and he threw up a lot. He<br/>
had to be treated for pneumonia repeatedly. He was diagnosed with<br/>
severe asthma and GERD (among other things) which required 6 different<br/>
daily medications that he did not like to take. My daughter complained<br/>
of nearly constant stomach pains, had bowel problems, couldn&#39;t sleep<br/>
well at night, had poor speech and was very clumsy. We took her to the<br/>
ER several times for serious head bumps.<br/>
<br/>
Going gfcf cleared most of these issues up within a week and DS was<br/>
able to go off all his meds. He no longer has asthma or throws up and<br/>
he enjoys being held. DD no longer has stomach pains or bowel problems<br/>
and her speech & agility improved tremendously and very rapidly.<br/>
That&#39;s just a *very* brief overview - there are so many more things<br/>
that improved, including numerous developmental issues.<br/>
<br/>
While they didn&#39;t really choose this diet in the sense of actively<br/>
deciding to do it voluntarily because they were so young, within a<br/>
week we could see it was clearly beneficial in many ways. We have<br/>
talked to them about it over the years and they know why they are<br/>
gfcf. There has (unfortunately) been a few times when they<br/>
accidentally ate non-gfcf foods and they ended up pretty sick and many<br/>
of the old problems reappeared with a bang. DD in particular has a<br/>
&quot;physical memory&quot; of eating non-gfcf foods and she takes great care to<br/>
avoid feeling like that again.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Can you make a deal with your supplier to buy case loads of favorite foods<br/>
&gt; at a better price?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So far this hasn&#39;t been an option but we&#39;re looking into a natural<br/>
foods co-op a few towns away to see if that will give us more buying<br/>
power. In the past few days I&#39;ve been brainstorming about ways to find<br/>
their foods at better prices. I found several really good coupons<br/>
online which will help out. I didn&#39;t even know there were coupons for<br/>
these foods until I searched - the only thing I ever see in my local<br/>
paper are coupons for cleaning supplies, pet food, canned veggies and<br/>
deodorant. I&#39;m very happy about this discovery!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve spent some time fine-tuning our grocery budget and making more $$<br/>
available for their specialty products. I&#39;m also going to take<br/>
advantage of every sale I can find. This past Saturday I was grocery<br/>
shopping and came across a display of close-out products. I about<br/>
jumped for joy when I saw a whole shelf of gluten-free pastas & cereal<br/>
bars on sale for *half off*. Whohoo! I went over my shopping list and<br/>
eliminated a few things so that I could afford to buy everything they<br/>
had at that price. The kids are tickled about this find. I think if I<br/>
search better and comparison shop, I can find good deals.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Fifteen dollars isn&#39;t that much (but I&#39;ve also lived through<br/>
&gt; times when fifteen dollars was nearly impossible to come by)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ahh - this is our situation right now, but there is a good reason for<br/>
it and I know things will improve in the future. We&#39;re all doing<br/>
without/sacrificing to a certain extent, but we&#39;ve been trying to<br/>
lessen the impact of this on the kids as much as possible. This period<br/>
of tight finances will not last forever. It too shall pass...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; Can you buy bulk amounts at the best price of the ingredients to make their<br/>
&gt; favorite things? &lt;snip&gt; or your local Asian market<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Someone else suggested going to an Asian market and buying in bulk.<br/>
There is one about an hour from us and we&#39;re going to check on their<br/>
prices. We cannot buy just any rice flour/noodles we find cheaply<br/>
because there is a lot of cross-contamination when flours are<br/>
run/ground/processed on the same equipment. The products we buy at<br/>
local specialty stores are more expensive but have been tested for the<br/>
presence of gluten & are processed on dedicated lines. We&#39;ll<br/>
definitely investigate the Asian food market option though! It would<br/>
be great if we can find what we need at a good price.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Can you trade out for services?  (an example might be cleaning<br/>
&gt; the Karate Dojo in exchange for kid&#39;s lessons.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a heck of an idea! I&#39;ll have to keep that in mind for when they<br/>
want to pursue these activities.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; you may not be able to reconcile it with the unschooling philosophy.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s not always easy, but it&#39;s always worth thinking about. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think we can find a way! There are unchangeable, unavoidable<br/>
&quot;restrictions&quot; people have to live with every day - lots of kids are<br/>
born with physical & mental challenges. For my kids a gfcf diet isn&#39;t<br/>
restrictive in a traditional sense of the word because there is no<br/>
viable alternative for them - it&#39;s just another aspect of their lives.<br/>
For them, gluten & dairy are akin to poisons. Calling a diet that<br/>
eliminates those substances &quot;restrictive&quot; is like calling an<br/>
environment that limits or excludes radon, strychnine and arsenic<br/>
&quot;restrictive&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really part of trying to provide them with the best possible care<br/>
and no matter what their diet is labeled as - &quot;restrictive&quot; or &quot;safe &<br/>
healthy&quot; - it doesn&#39;t change their dietary needs and they&#39;ll have to<br/>
go forward with these same needs their whole life no matter how<br/>
we/they/others choose to view them. So we might as well not choose to<br/>
look at the diet from a negative light, but instead to look at how it<br/>
has a positive impact.<br/>
<br/>
The true limiting issue comes from them not having as much desired<br/>
food items as they would like, which is why I asked for advice &<br/>
ideas, because I want to remedy that. There have been lots of great<br/>
suggestions and I&#39;m in full problem-solving mode now, so I think we&#39;ll<br/>
find a way to meet their needs for these foods and continue down our<br/>
unschooling path!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for your reply! Your comments have helped me re-examine<br/>
the benefits of their diet and reaffirm that, regardless of cost, it<br/>
is a blessing it is to be able to provide them with something that<br/>
gives them a better quality of life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1250323515">***I would never let them walk around the house starving!***<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I didn&#39;t think you were letting them starve,&lt;g&gt;  but hunger can be <br/>
about more than a physically empty stomach.   We can be needy for things we <br/>
think we&#39;re not getting enough of.  That&#39;s a problem with limits.<br/>
<br/>
***so it may not be a carb issue as I originally thought.***<br/>
<br/>
It seems very likely an issue with allowed foods and their availability.<br/>
<br/>
***I hope you&#39;re not saying that families with kids that must be on<br/>
special diets cannot also be unschoolers. :)***<br/>
<br/>
Anytime one person is limiting the choices for another person it can <br/>
interfere with unschooling.   That doesn&#39;t mean a parent will never limit a <br/>
child&#39;s choice, it means that parent might deal with issues other <br/>
unschooling parents don&#39;t have.   If you&#39;re in that situation it may not <br/>
always be easy to reconcile a particular decision with unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If I had a child with a severe allergy to some food I would definitely have <br/>
kept that food out of the house.  I would have socialized with people who <br/>
could easily and happily accommodate us and avoided going into the homes of <br/>
those who couldn&#39;t, until my kid was old enough to understand and avoid <br/>
those foods on his own.  I have some experience with a child who chose a <br/>
diet different from anyone else we knew when he was very young, and I know a <br/>
very young person is capable of choosing and deciding.<br/>
<br/>
An immediate life threatening allergy is different from an ethical choice <br/>
and even different from a general health maintenance diet.   We know enough <br/>
about human psychology to know that even people who&#39;ve had quadruple bypass <br/>
surgery and have been told that they should change their diet if they want <br/>
to continue to live well can have a difficult time or even find it <br/>
impossible to stick to a diet prescribed by someone else.<br/>
<br/>
And like the bypass patient, who can feel resentful toward his doctor about <br/>
the diet limits even though the clogged arteries were not the doctors fault, <br/>
kids on restrictive diets can feel resentful toward the person who enforced <br/>
the diet.   That&#39;s a potential problem that can interfere with unschooling. <br/>
If you&#39;re creative and thoughtful you might be able to make a difficult <br/>
situation work but it&#39;s not an ideal situation and that&#39;s what I meant.<br/>
<br/>
***Calling a diet that<br/>
eliminates those substances &quot;restrictive&quot; is like calling an<br/>
environment that limits or excludes radon, strychnine and arsenic<br/>
&quot;restrictive&quot;.***<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a difference. &lt;g&gt;   Your kids will probably never look at arsenic <br/>
laced river sediment and want to eat a big plate full.  They might very much <br/>
want to try some chocolate cake.  The difference is in their desire. The <br/>
difference is in their psyche. That&#39;s the difference that matters to <br/>
unschooling.   When a person wants something they can&#39;t have they feel <br/>
restricted.   I&#39;ve never met a kid who was longing for radon but maybe I&#39;m <br/>
just hanging with a different crowd. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If your kids haven&#39;t made the association between certain foods and how <br/>
those foods leave them feeling then not getting the chocolate cake leaves a <br/>
big hole of need.   The hole is the problem with regards to unschooling. <br/>
As their mom you should avoid the holes as much as possible.   I don&#39;t think <br/>
you can do that by limiting the foods their allowed to have.  And I think <br/>
that was your original question, why are they so needy and what can you do <br/>
about it.  They&#39;re needy because they already feel limited, they already <br/>
have a hole.  What can you do about it?  Fill them up.<br/>
<br/>
Even when adults can make an association between an activity or food and the <br/>
way that activity or food makes them feel, they often choose the activity or <br/>
food because they believe the pleasure of the thing is worth feeling <br/>
uncomfortable later.     Emotionally healthy people can make those choices <br/>
and still give consideration to their physical health and maintain a <br/>
balance.    Emotionally needy people just keep trying to fill the hole <br/>
inside them, sometimes at the expense of their physical health. <br/>
Unschooling won&#39;t work where people are emotionally unbalanced, where their <br/>
unfulfilled need is driving them.   You&#39;re unschooling mission, if you <br/>
choose to accept it, is to eliminate neediness. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
***We cannot buy just any rice flour/noodles we find cheaply<br/>
because there is a lot of cross-contamination when flours are<br/>
run/ground/processed on the same equipment.***<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you can find a used flour mill on ebay or on a swap board and grind <br/>
your own.  Advertise in your local paper that you want a free flour grinder. <br/>
Some old lady might have one in her basement.<br/>
<br/>
If you have friends and family members who buy birthday and Christmas gifts <br/>
for your family, maybe you could suggest gift certificates at the health <br/>
food store so the kids can by a bunch of their favorite things.<br/>
<br/>
We live ninety one miles from the best health food store.  There&#39;s a small <br/>
one thirty six miles away but they don&#39;t have everything we like, and <br/>
there&#39;s another one about sixty miles away, also short on some things we <br/>
typically buy.    They will mail some items to us and in the winter or with <br/>
gas prices as high as they are, this is sometimes an economical and <br/>
convenient option.   So if you live a distance from your health food store <br/>
ask about getting some items shipped to you.   What a nice surprise for your <br/>
kids to get their favorite cookies in the mail some week you didn&#39;t have <br/>
time to get to the health food store!<br/>
<br/>
Rice puddings are easy treats if your kids like sweets.  Chocolate rice <br/>
pudding is one of my favorite foods. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My brother makes peanut butter cookies without flour.    He says his kids <br/>
love them.  I haven&#39;t tried them, but the recipe is:<br/>
<br/>
2 c. peanut butter<br/>
2/3 c. brown sugar<br/>
6 TBS. fructose<br/>
2 large eggs<br/>
<br/>
Mix, roll into balls, flatten with a fork dipped in sugar, bake 10-12 <br/>
minutes at 350.  Let cookies cool on cookie sheet before removing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-263620197">Is there any way you can buy *ingredients* so you can make things? For<br/>
example, buy the rice flour (or whatever else you&#39;ve found that&#39;s safe)<br/>
and what all to *make* cookies whenever throughout the week, and/or buy<br/>
safe mixes (I know our co-op and most places like Whole Foods and Trader<br/>
Joe&#39;s have lots of options in this regard). Also, fruits and veggies are<br/>
FULL of carbs - how about adding potatoes of all sorts (russet, gold,<br/>
sweet, &#39;gem&#39;, etc) to meals for one. Beans/lentils are also another<br/>
&quot;fill me up&quot; type food. As are oats (if you can find &#39;safe&#39; oats that<br/>
aren&#39;t cross contaminated with wheat - I think McCann&#39;s &lt;sp&gt; brand is a<br/>
fairly safe brand of oats for gluten free folks). It&#39;s possible to make<br/>
tortillas and pizza doughs with rice flour. A &quot;shepherd&#39;s pie&quot; of<br/>
potatoes, beans or lentils, and peas (or other safe veggie) is quite the<br/>
stick to the ribs meal. And, be sure to stock up on the rice-based pasta<br/>
whenever you can. For &#39;staple&#39; items, I rotate what I stock up on - one<br/>
week I&#39;ll buy lots of pasta, another week lots of beans, and so on. That<br/>
way, the bottom line stays the same but I&#39;ve got pasta for a month,<br/>
beans for a month, and so on. By the time the pasta runs low, it&#39;s the<br/>
pasta&#39;s turn to be stocked.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1975672605">Gee - I just realized how little &quot;bread&quot; (loaf type stuff) we&#39;ve<br/>
actually been eating lately. We&#39;ve chosen to just make our own and we&#39;ve<br/>
got the ingredients (all sorts of flours) and even a bread machine to<br/>
make it easier (and cooler in the summer). But, we often just don&#39;t<br/>
bother with it. We do eat LOTS of brown rice and tortillas (bought at<br/>
our vegetarian co-op or homemade) and sometimes corn tortilla chips. One<br/>
of the big changes is minimizing our potato usage because, much to my<br/>
potato-loving chagrin, it really did a number on my blood glucose<br/>
readings to eat a basic baked potato. So, that whole balance is<br/>
different now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2015542349">Can you include in the planning/budgeting once a month trips to wherever<br/>
for staples (rice flour, gfcf pastas and mixes and so on) and include in<br/>
maybe some other fun stuff (whatever is available in that town that you<br/>
don&#39;t often get to see or do - like maybe a matinee movie or something)<br/>
and make a day of it once a month to stock up on the good stuff at<br/>
better prices?<br/>
