dear Kelly,<br/>
<br/>
I seek help....as i said INDIAN HOMES ARE DIFFERENT.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think that, if we truly cannot *at this moment*, we can say so. And<br/>
*should* say so.<br/>
But three is very little, and to him, what you&#39;re doing may not seem<br/>
nearly as important as playing with him right this minute.<br/>
If he&#39;s &quot;tantrumming, &quot; he&#39;s trying really hard to communicate. He<br/>
really should have to resort to that kind of communication to get your<br/>
attention.<br/>
<br/>
-----HOUSEHOLD CHORES IS A VERY LONGLIST...AND TIMECONSUMING...AND <br/>
NOTHING CAN<br/>
BE CUTSHORT OR GO OUT OF THE FIXED TIMETABLE....MIL...will beging a <br/>
long crib<br/>
that will go on for days together and will have a snowball effect on <br/>
all in the<br/>
family.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-==-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I make him realise that its &quot;freeplay time&quot; and he cannot be supported<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Noooooo!!!!<br/>
<br/>
While it&#39;s fine to expect some &quot;freeplay time,&quot; the whole idea that &quot;he<br/>
cannot be supported&quot; is yucky! He&#39;s THREE---he *needs* to be supported!<br/>
He *really* NEEDS it<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
------<br/>
I SUPPORT HIM BY HELPING HIM MAKE CHOICES OF WHAT HE WANT TO DO....WHAT <br/>
ELSE CAN<br/>
BE DONE HERE?<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
so he can choose what he want to do untill i or granny can come<br/>
around.....<br/>
<br/>
What are you and Granny doing that&#39;s so important that he can&#39;t get his<br/>
needs met? Seriously? He&#39;s three. If *you*, his own mother, won&#39;t meet<br/>
them, who will?<br/>
<br/>
FOR EG. WE ARE CLEANING GRAINS THAT WILL BE STORED FOR ENITRE <br/>
YEAR....IT&#39;S A<br/>
HELL LOT OF MESSY WORK.....AND &quot;HAS TO BE&quot; ACCOMPLISHED BY NOON. VEER <br/>
WANTS TO<br/>
PARTICIPATE BUT WILL NOT BE ALLOWED....AS I TRY TO STRIKE BALANCE <br/>
HERE....I LOSE<br/>
TIME....AND MIL WILL BEGIN CRIBBING....IF I DON&#39;T VEER WILL THROW <br/>
TANTRUM.....OH<br/>
MY GOD, HELP ME ITS A NIGHTMARE.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
if the tantrum persist i count up to 5. 9 out 10 time....the tantrum<br/>
has ended! He<br/>
takes his stand and has found something else to do for himself.<br/>
what do you think he&#39;s learned?<br/>
*I* think he&#39;s learned that you are not trustworthy. That he can&#39;t<br/>
count on you, his mother, to care for his needs. He&#39;s giving up on you.<br/>
Keep doing that, and he will probably learn that he really *doesn&#39;t*<br/>
need you and he won&#39;t come to you for help or comfort. Is that what you<br/>
want?<br/>
He&#39;ll still need comfort and help, but he&#39;ll look somewhere else.<br/>
I&#39;m not to sure if this strategy is right as per unschooling<br/>
principles. No<br/>
other stand is visible for me too!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
YES I AGREE, I HAVE SEEN HIM DOING THAT...CAN&#39;T SEE ANY OTHER STRATEGY <br/>
TO HANDLE<br/>
THIS.<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
STOP what you&#39;re doing and attend to your child. There&#39;s NOTHING else<br/>
more important. Nothing.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t get this opportunity but for a few years. Enjoy it. Relish<br/>
it. You&#39;ll miss it, I promise.<br/>
<br/>
COACH ME FOR SOMEMORE TIME PLS....<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
Poonam<br/>

<br/>
Can you tell me HOW Indian homes are different?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
HOUSEHOLD CHORES IS A VERY LONGLIST...AND TIMECONSUMING...AND<br/>
NOTHING CAN BE CUTSHORT OR GO OUT OF THE FIXED TIMETABLE<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Every home has things to be done everyday. What can&#39;t be cut short? <br/>
Why&#39;s the timetable so rigid? Help US help YOU.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
....MIL...will beging a long crib that will go on for days together and <br/>

<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
No one person should have that much control over the rest of the family.<br/>
<br/>
Period.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It has a lot to do with *attitude*, Poonam.<br/>
<br/>
As a tiny, tiny child, he really and truly NEEDS to know he&#39;s supported.<br/>
<br/>
Can you give us concrete examples of the problems you are struggling <br/>
with?<br/>

<br/>
*Why* must something like that be &quot;accomplished by noon&quot;? Is there a <br/>
REAL reason? Or is it because that&#39;s what the mother-in-law says?<br/>
<br/>
&#39;Cause that&#39;s not a *real* reason! &lt;g&gt; It&#39;s *her* reason, and it may be <br/>
&quot;real&quot; to her, but that doesn&#39;t mean it should control your baby and <br/>
how you care for him.<br/>

We&#39;re happy to, Poonam, but you&#39;ll need to be more specific.<br/>
