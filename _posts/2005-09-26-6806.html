 </span></blockquote>Oh dear Holly! First, I&#39;d suggest you focus on what you need to do <br/>
now - leave off the worrying about school for a moment and focus on <br/>
getting yourself &#39;well&#39;. If it&#39;s still in the &#39;may have&#39; stage, ask <br/>
lots of questions, do lots of 2nd and 3rd and 4th opinions on <br/>
treatment options, etc. *Assume* things will work out positively <br/>
while -preparing- for if they don&#39;t. <br/>
<br/>
School is not the only alternative to the situation. Any family or <br/>
friends who would be willing to provide &quot;adult supervision&quot; while DH <br/>
is at work? Any possibility that DH can work from home a couple days <br/>
per week or month? And, too, look around at the possible &#39;school <br/>
type&#39; options - for example, is there a Sudbury Valley-style school <br/>
in your area (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sudval.org/07_othe_01.html)">http://www.sudval.org/07_othe_01.html)</a>? Are there <br/>
progressive type private schools around you? magnet schools that <br/>
might be of interest (arts magnets or science magnets, things DS <br/>
enjoys) and so on. Home or public school are not the only two <br/>
options - even if you get to a worst-case scenario.  And, even <br/>
school isn&#39;t the worst case IF the person going in KNOWS there is <br/>
more to life and this is just for now.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I do hope it turns out well treatable (hey my 87 yr old aunt is a <br/>
colon cancer survivor - you&#39;re younger and start out healthier <br/>
probably). Don&#39;t necessarily look only to homeschooling families. If <br/>
you&#39;ve got a couple of close friends who would simply be willing to <br/>
provide &#39;child care&#39; a few days per week, that&#39;s all you&#39;d need. The <br/>
homeschooling families might be handy for transportation for DS to <br/>
and from assorted activities (park days, co-op type <br/>
activities, &#39;field trips&#39; with their hs group if they have one, <br/>
etc). Stuff that DH might not be able to do simply because they <br/>
occur during the day time.<br/>
<br/>
On the worst case side, if you&#39;ve ever worked, your spouse, as <br/>
guardian, would get some small amount of money in &#39;survivor&#39;s <br/>
benefit&#39; from what you&#39;ve paid in to Social Security. Perhaps that <br/>
would help pay for either child care or a relaxed private school or <br/>
maybe even, depending on your state laws, someone to act as a <br/>
private tutor at your home. For that matter, maybe some sort of room <br/>
and board in exchange for child care deal (sort of au pair style) <br/>
might be doable at that point (especially if you are near a <br/>
university - college kids can be a good resource).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-659734836">Hi Holly,<br/>
I&#39;m so sorry to hear this news.  I have thought about this issue a lot in my<br/>
own life and we have a plan worked out already should that situation come to<br/>
pass.  My friends will take care of my daughter and help my husband find<br/>
someone to be with her daily as a sort of nanny-type person.  I know the my<br/>
friends will pick the right person and they will be able to check on her<br/>
frequently and they have no problem firing her if she&#39;s not what they<br/>
expected.  They will &quot;educate&quot; her in unschooling if she doesn&#39;t already<br/>
know what that is, and get to know her as best they can.  She will have to<br/>
spend a lot of time with them anyway since many of my daughter&#39;s activities<br/>
include spending time with our unschooling friends and their children.<br/>

<br/>
Dear Holly,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so sorry to hear this. The only thing remotely similar to your situation<br/>
that I have experienced is a recent &quot;bad&quot; pap smear, a situation my doctor<br/>
and I are monitoring. It is a loooong way from life threatening. However it<br/>
did give me pause a little.<br/>
<br/>
The first thing that I thought of was to reiterate to myself and my family<br/>
how very grateful I am for the lifestyle we have, and my determination to<br/>
hang on to this feeling of wonder and joy. One way that I do that is by<br/>
focusing on the present as much as possible.<br/>
<br/>
When something as serious as a life threatening illness appears in our lives<br/>
making statements based on our past experience may be mentally closing the<br/>
door to new options. What I am referring to is the idea that you express,<br/>
perhaps unwittingly, that your dh would be unwilling or unable to change<br/>
*his* life, and would carry on as if nothing were different either while you<br/>
are undergoing any needed treatments, or if the worst happened and you<br/>
didn&#39;t recover. <br/>
<br/>
Most work places, although I don&#39;t know what your dh does, have<br/>
compassionate or family leave - sometimes it is possible to combine accrued<br/>
sick days, vacation days and family leave to extend the time off. I hope you<br/>
and your dh can talk in terms of possibilities instead of impossibilities.<br/>
<br/>
Please keep us posted.<br/>
<br/>

I agree!  I don&#39;t know what type or where this cancer is (and I&#39;m not <br/>

threat.  I have friends who have been diagnosed with various types of <br/>
cancer and have survived it (a friend with breast cancer, my dad had <br/>
colon cancer 15 years ago, he&#39;ll be 81 this year).  Don&#39;t give up and <br/>

<br/>
If you pursue treatment you might have five or more years even if it&#39;s a<br/>
difficult case.  Your treatment will not keep you away from your home or<br/>
family.  Your son can go with you to chemo or radiation.   In five years<br/>
of happy unschooling your husband and son will have the confidence to<br/>
find a way to continue to unschool.   Your son will be five years older. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All parents worry what their children would do without them and none of<br/>

the best possible scenario. <br/>

I must echo the others here on getting a second<br/>

treatments available now, that is in your favor. <br/>
Also, there are numerous healthy eating books on the<br/>

I found out I may have cancer. I am concerned about my husband & son&#39;s <br/>
future. My son&#39;s &quot;behind&quot; according to &quot;School Standards&quot; and I&#39;m just <br/>

because my husband is unable to take him to work daily.<br/>
<br/>
Have any of you thought of this or gone through this?<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
First, I&#39;m so sorry that you have to go through the process of even thinking about it.<br/>
 <br/>
But as some have already said, have a positive attitude: it may actually be nothing.<br/>
 <br/>
Where do you live, Holly? I&#39;m sure we can hook you up---or help start a network, at least---of unschoolers in your area that can give you advice and help your husband make things work.<br/>
 <br/>
On a sad, but hopeful, note---and this is for ALL parents because we never know what will happen from day-to-day: I&#39;d like to suggest that you---and that we ALL---take a day to sit down with a video recorder and speak to our children. Tell them about us, about how it felt to hold them for the first time. Our hopes and dreams for them, the reasons we chose to unschool, etc. <br/>
 <br/>
*Any*thing could happen to any of us any time. Having such a video could be such a comfort to a young child---hell, to ANY child! <br/>
 <br/>
When it&#39;s too late, it&#39;s too late. Do it now. Do it soon. And add to it as they grow.<br/>
 <br/>
If something *were* to happen to you, Holly, or to any of us---young memories come hard sometimes---how we look, how we sound, what we want, how much we love them...these things can become fuzzy. A little piece of us on tape could be a very special gift.  <br/>
 <br/>
I hope your doctor&#39;s wrong. I hope you have a long, long life and can hold that boy forever. But if not, this could be something he can have of you and cherish forever.<br/>
 <br/>
I wish you the very best!<br/>
 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-699793605">Thank-you to everyone for your responses. I truly appreciate it and <br/>
have copied your posts into a file so that I can think about everything.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m the type of person who likes to annalyze a situation and plan <br/>
accordingly. For Example, I believe that I will be around here for <br/>
awhile, but, I want to have some sort of plan in the event that the <br/>
cancer is an aggressive type. <br/>
<br/>
The first diagnosis was ovarian cancer, grade 1, which means it&#39;s a non-<br/>
aggressive slow moving type. However, I was informed by my doctor that <br/>
the type of cancer I have is rare and that he knows that the local <br/>
pathology department doesn&#39;t have much experience, so I have since gone <br/>
to another doctor and the report/slides will be reviewed by a <br/>
specialist at USC. (I am in So. Calif.).<br/>
<br/>
I will post again when I know more. Thank-you for all of the wonderful <br/>
suggestions...a nanny with my Survivor&#39;s Benefits, a remembrance video, <br/>
coop with other unschoolers, whew! A lot to ponder! Thank-you Again!!</div>

Yes, please keep us posted.   Sometimes it helps to write your thoughts <br/>
out and share them.   You&#39;ll be in my thoughts.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-393773125">Don&#39;t know if this will help...but<br/>
I asked a friend to agree to &quot;nanny&quot; my kids if anything ever happened to<br/>
me.  She spends lots of time with us and gets unschooling.  Dh and I agreed<br/>
to use the insurance money should I die to pay for services to help the kids<br/>
stay home and pursue their interests.  My friend is (for now at least)<br/>
single no kids and she loves me and mine.  The plan is for her to spend<br/>
&quot;work time&quot; with my kids helping them and stuff and that Eric would pay her<br/>
and make sure to help her get whatever education she wants.  She has wanted<br/>
to finish her degree but finances have been in the way.<br/>
 <br/>
Each year I&#39;ll probably reevaluate.  Her life won&#39;t stay as free and open as<br/>
it is now but for now this has eased my mind.<br/>
 <br/>
May your diagnosis and treatment be easy to bear.  For now do what you can<br/>
to love yourself and your kids.<br/>
 <br/>
you&#39;re in my thoughts and prayers,<br/>
 <br/>
