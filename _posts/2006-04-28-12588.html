 </span></blockquote>This is the easiest question to answer and it usually calms other people&#39;s<br/>
concerns.  What I say is, &quot;How can I not be around my children all day an<br/>
not know if they are progressing?  Tests are for teachers of 30 kids so that<br/>
they can have a better understanding if they have a child who is behind the<br/>
others.  I have only 3 (or how ever many you have) and don&#39;t need a test to<br/>
tell me what I already know they understand.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s the cool thing.  Your family doesn&#39;t have to accept unschooling.  I<br/>
figured out quite some time ago that my family doesn&#39;t accept at least half<br/>
the decisions I have made in my life and they don&#39;t have to.  I&#39;m not going<br/>
to sit in another closet in fear because their acceptance doesn&#39;t truly have<br/>
an effect on me.  They can disapprove all they want, but it doesn&#39;t do them,<br/>
me nor my children any good.  You are doing nothing illegal.  Your children<br/>
are not in harm, being neglected, nor abused.  I think the first thing you<br/>
have to do is establish yourself as your chldren&#39;s parent.  When you feel<br/>
like you have to have other people&#39;s approval to do things for and with your<br/>
children, you are not the authoritative parent.  You are living by someone<br/>
else&#39;s rules.  They are parenting your children.  Hiding what you do from<br/>
your family isn&#39;t healthy for you nor your children.  And what kind of<br/>
lesson is that for your children?  It&#39;s telling them that you are doing<br/>
something wrong and you aren&#39;t!  Unschooling is freeing.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t talk about unschooling to my extended family, but then I try not to<br/>
talk to my extended family about anything :)  My grandmother and aunt and<br/>
uncles just would not get it and think I am loonier than they already think<br/>
I am.  (I mean I had 3 kids and breastfed them until they were all like, I<br/>
don&#39;t know 18 or something and she &quot;lets&quot; her husband (who they dont&#39; know I<br/>
divorced because we are still living together) wear his hair down to his<br/>
butt and they don&#39;t go to church - pagan here as well.)  My mother knows we<br/>
unschool and she doesn&#39;t approve, but (shrug)  she doesn&#39;t approve of most<br/>
of my life either, but I&#39;m not harming my children and maybe one of these<br/>
days I will wake up and realize the horrible disservice I have done to my<br/>
children by home/unschooling them and get them back into all these wonderful<br/>
enrichment programs that she keeps sending me information about.<br/>
<br/>
I need some help in dispelling the fear-demon - and quick!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Then tell the fear-demon to go away.  If you are excited and are in love<br/>
with what you are doing then it doesn&#39;t matter whether other people approve<br/>
or disapprove.  :)<br/>

Burn those report cards and don&#39;t give them another thought. How&#39;s she doing at being Safiya? She can&#39;t fail at that and she can&#39;t be behind herself. That&#39;s what matters.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1314554622">Maisha,  <br/>
I have been reading your past posts and you so don&#39;t have to worry!  We just got Lily&#39;s last <br/>
reportcard, her Dad and i both read it, then hid it, it was horrible. No wonder she thought <br/>
she was stupid(a swear in our house), her teacher saw none of her real qualities, only test <br/>
scores...and how she dealt with 14 other kids rough housing during the test...ok move on.   <br/>
What state are you in?  In Vt the child is not assessed by comparing how they are doing <br/>
now to how they were doing in school, it is more independant.  And Vt has a few different <br/>
ways of assessing.  Good luck, and find others who have been through the assessment <br/>
process.  I am scared too, of the assessment, but we have help.  <br/>

Thanks Mary.  I&#39;ll have to remember that.  I&#39;m working on deschooling myself!  LOL  Of course now I&#39;m taking online college classes so I&#39;ll have to work doubly hard not to think &#39;schooly thoughts&#39; with my kids.<br/>

Thanks Melanie - I&#39;m going to &#39;not worry&#39; and just let her my other kids &#39;be&#39;.  I&#39;m in Maryland. I&#39;ve opted out of testing though.  I just don&#39;t agree with all of the testing.<br/>
