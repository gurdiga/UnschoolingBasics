<div id="ygrps-yiv-865483478">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Earlier in a post I made probably earlier this week, I talked about <br/>
how we experimented with a penny to see what would make it <br/>
look &quot;new&quot; again, some of you might have had questions on whether <br/>
that was schooling my kids or not.<br/>
<br/>
Just to clarify this a little, my kids love to learn through <br/>
experimentation.  They would rather see how something works, than <br/>
read about it on the computer.  Remember, my son came to me, and <br/>
asked me if I new how to clean a penny.  Unschooling is learning <br/>
through life experiences, and to us this was one.  Everyone is <br/>
entitled to their own opinions, and thoughts, but who am I to tell <br/>
my son to go look it up on the computer, instead of brainstorming <br/>
with him.  We learned how to &quot;clean&quot; the penny together.  I have <br/>
gotten some really good ideas on how to clean one, and once I have <br/>
the stuff, I think we will try those too.  So thanks for all the <br/>
extra information.<br/>
<br/>
I am not angry at anyone, I just wanted to explain why we chose to <br/>
experiment, instead of read about it.  Experimenting was more fun, <br/>
and they could see the results.<br/>
<br/>
Have a gread weekend.<br/>

<br/>
I saw no advice telling you to ask your child to go look it up, nor<br/>
did I see anyone suggesting that experimentation is not a valid and<br/>
useful tool. In fact, if you had posted about telling your son to &quot;go<br/>
look it up&quot; you would have heard a lot of suggestions to NOT do that.<br/>
<br/>
Am I missing something here?  Yes, you will also hear a lot of<br/>
opinions about how turning something into a &quot;lesson&quot; or &quot;learning<br/>
moment&quot; is not a good idea...but mucking about with something just for<br/>
the fun of it isn&#39;t exactly doing that. Hopefully, people will use a<br/>
variety of resources for information depending on what is useful for<br/>
the moment. Looking something up on the computer can aid and assist<br/>
experimentation...it doesn&#39;t need to be one or the other.<br/>

No, no, no. I knew what you were trying to clarify, I was just trying to explain it to Ren. I don&#39;t think anyone is taking offense at anything here. We&#39;re just trying to get a clear idea of how unschooling works best and flows.<br/>
<br/>
I think your penny experiments sounded fun. If you had a kid who asked you to google it, I&#39;m sure you would have gone that route and had fun with it as well.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;lesson&quot; or &quot;learning<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; moment&quot; is not a good idea...but mucking about<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; with something just for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the fun of it isn&#39;t exactly doing that.<br/>
&gt; Hopefully,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; people will use a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; variety of resources for information depending<br/>
&gt; on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; what is useful for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the moment. Looking something up on the<br/>
&gt; computer<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; can aid and assist<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experimentation...it doesn&#39;t need to be one or<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; other.<br/>
