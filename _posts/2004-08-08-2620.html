  Anyway, my issue is smoking.  I have 2 friends which started smoking<br/>
when they were 10.  At 14 they gained the courage to ask their parents for<br/>
permission which their parents gave them.  I also started smoking at 10, but<br/>
never gained that courage.  I see those two friends as being highly addicted<br/>
to cigarettes to this day.  They find it impossible to quit.  I quit seven<br/>
years ago.  Both of these friends say they wish their parents wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
given them permission.  Their theory is that they wouldn&#39;t have smoked as<br/>
much if they had to hide it from their parents and maybe, just maybe, they<br/>
wouldn&#39;t need it so much now.    I think about my experience quitting and it<br/>
WAS quite easy because there were only a few times a day when I wanted to<br/>
smoke.<br/>

This is interesting.<br/>
When I was about 12 my parents gathered my sister and me and talked to us <br/>
about smoking. They said they figured we&#39;d probably try it one way or another, <br/>
and if we chose to smoke, they&#39;d prefer us to do it at home around them rather <br/>
than sneaking around. My dad smoked, my mom didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Neither of us has ever been a smoker, and we&#39;ve both agreed that a lot of it <br/>
was that the mystery and glamour was gone, and that we could just make a clear <br/>
decision about it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1695331690">I smoked and so did my older sister about the age of 12. Our mother and <br/>
stepdad (who smoked) were totally against us smoking and never gave permission. Our <br/>
father and stepmother (who also smoked) did have some kind of discussion but <br/>
that was after the fact and it was more of a coming of age thing. <br/>
<br/>
My stepfather died of cancer when I was 21. My Mom, former stepmom,my Dad and <br/>
my sister all still smoke. I quit before each baby X4 and when I went into <br/>
the Marines. Each time except the last I began smoking again because someone <br/>
nagged me not too begin so I rebelled. I have not started again but there are <br/>
times that I do feel as if I need a vice. I did try once but I was ill for a good <br/>
two hours. I know smoking is bad but I also know that smoking nets me alone <br/>
time on the deck with my tea in the evening.<br/>
<br/>
Ive heard that more women smoke esp if Mom smoked. I believe this bc when my <br/>
older sister (1yr,1mo and 1 day older than I) came to visit the smell was so <br/>
much like Moms. The make-up, the coffee and the cigarette mix from when I was a <br/>
child came rushing back. I actually said to her you smell like mom. She asked <br/>
if that was bad I said heck no. I guess the study showed that if mom smoked <br/>
it triggers childhood memories. It did.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1262818638">Just wanted to chime in on smoking which is something I hope that my kids<br/>
don&#39;t choose.  Nobody in either side of our families smokes, so I&#39;m relieved<br/>
that there is no role modeling there of smoking, which I think is a big plus<br/>
for kids.  I also think that in an atmosphere where my kids know their<br/>
choices are always respected, they would never feel the need to &quot;sneak&quot;<br/>
cigarettes or any decision so that they were *already* addicted at the time<br/>
they brought the subject up for discussion.  It almost seems like their<br/>
asking &quot;permission&quot; after being addicted is a lose/lose situation.  If I say<br/>
&quot;no&quot; then I run the risk of alienating them.  If I say &quot;yes&quot; then it may<br/>
well feel to them (depending on the discussion) that I&#39;m approving smoking.<br/>
In a situation where they were already addicted and asked my &quot;permission&quot;<br/>
I&#39;d try to change the conversation to a different one.  I&#39;d talk about what<br/>
I know of cigarettes, what it does to people&#39;s bodies, and how the addiction<br/>
works.  I&#39;d talk about ways to quit so it&#39;s not as hard and offer a few<br/>
things...my love for them and worry about their bodies if they continue to<br/>
smoke, and my help if they would like to quit.<br/>
<br/>
But like I said, in an unschooling atmosphere, I&#39;d have a hard time for them<br/>
feeling the &quot;need&quot; to sneak it since there are no punishments for their<br/>
choices.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;ve found so far in our young family life is that we&#39;ve already ended<br/>
up talking about smoking.  My daughter (5.9) asked earlier this year &quot;what<br/>
is that mom?&quot; pointing to an ashtray.  We were in a public place.  I think<br/>
there was someone there using it.  So that started a fairly basic discussion<br/>
on what the man was doing with that stick in his mouth, what the ashtray was<br/>
for.  What smoking does to your body.  That people don&#39;t always do things<br/>
for the &quot;smart&quot; reason.  Why it&#39;s so hard to stop.  I think this type of<br/>
discussion will certainly go a lot longer a way in her life than something<br/>
like &quot;He&#39;s doing something yucky that you&#39;re never allowed to do&quot; or<br/>
something along those lines which I&#39;ve heard other parents do.<br/>
<br/>
So my hope and belief is that my kids will talk to me beforehand which will<br/>
allow me to give them my strong beliefs and good information for them to<br/>
make what I hope will be the decision not to smoke.  If they do decide to do<br/>
it, it&#39;ll be hard, but I will respect it while not telling them I think<br/>
smoking is okay.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-374013698">I wanted to relay a story about smoking that amazed me.  A friend of mine<br/>
who is a single mom sends her 6 year old son to Sudbury Valley School (which<br/>
for anyone not familiar with the school, follows an unschooling philosophy -<br/>
kids follow their interests, no classes, schedules, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
They do not have &quot;rules&quot; made by faculty or administration there, but rather<br/>
agreements that they have all voted on.  Staff at the school have one vote,<br/>
same as each student.  The current agreement about smoking is that kids are<br/>
allowed to smoke at the school with a parent&#39;s signed permission form.<br/>
<br/>
My friend&#39;s son recently said to her as they were driving along in the car,<br/>
&quot;Mom, my friend, Josh, smokes.  Can I try that?&quot;  Inside my friend&#39;s head<br/>
she was freaking, thinking &quot;Oh my God, smoking!&quot;  However she feels very<br/>
strongly about her son making his own decisions so she remained calm and<br/>
said &quot;Well, if you decided to smoke, it would make me very sad because there<br/>
are chemicals in cigarettes that make your lungs and throat sick and I would<br/>
not want you to get sick...&quot;  They discussed it some more and her son ended<br/>
up feeling sad for his friend that was smoking and doing this to his lungs.<br/>
He went back and talked to his friend about how sad he felt that his friend<br/>
was smoking.  He even went so far as to consider bringing up an article<br/>
before the school to change the agreement about smoking (but changed his<br/>
mind...speaking in front of a whole school is a pretty large order for a 6<br/>
year old...)<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me so much less likely that my friend&#39;s son will ever decide to<br/>
smoke than a kid whose parent&#39;s reaction would be &quot;What?  Smoking?  That&#39;s<br/>
an awful thing and you&#39;re absolutely not allowed to do that!&quot;<br/>

 <br/>
Depends on the state:<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
The primary tobacco laws in South Carolina regulate youth access to tobacco  <br/>
products and establish taxes and wholesale vending licenses. Although there is <br/>
 currently no law that prohibits minors from purchasing or possessing tobacco <br/>
 products, state criminal and federal civil penalties exist for anyone who <br/>
sells  or otherwise provides tobacco products to a person under the age of 18 in <br/>
South  Carolina. Any person who sells or supplies cigarettes or other tobacco <br/>
products  to a minor is guilty of a misdemeanor, with fines beginning at $25 <br/>
for a first  offense. Retailers who sell to minors risk federal civil <br/>
penalties ranging from  fines of $250 to up to $10,000 or more.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1967227094">I&#39;m a former smoker, my sister is trying to quit again, something she does almost yearly, it seems.  My brother used to smoke, but he&#39;d quit last I heard.  I know Will, my oldest son, has smoked socially -- at parties and such -- and may have taken it up full time.  I wouldn&#39;t be surprised.  My ex (his bio-Dad) was/is a smoker, as are my ex-mil and her dh.  There&#39;s a long history of love-hate relationships with smoking in my family.<br/>
 <br/>
My Dad&#39;s dad died of lung cancer at 55 yo -- lived 4 yrs after diagnosis, spent his last two years bedridden -- the result of smoking since his early teens.  My Dad smoked pipes for much of my childhood, one uncle smoked for a few years in his early 20&#39;s, one still smokes the nastiest cigars I&#39;ve ever smelled. ::shudder:::  So, my Dad was horrified when we all became smokers in our late teens.   In part, I think I may have started as a defiance -- I know my sister did it for defiance.  <br/>
 <br/>
My Mom started smoking at 15,  with her parents&#39; permission, tho she did not smoke when for most of my childhood, having been bullied into quitting while pregnant with my younger sister.  The day she and my Dad split up 15 yrs later, she bought a carton of cigarettes.  She&#39;s stopped once or twice since then, but never for more than a few months.  Now, she&#39;s at a place where she recognizes it&#39;s self-medication for depression, but figures it&#39;s less expensive and more enjoyable than being on Paxil or some other drug for the rest of her life.  Both of her parents smoked -- Grandpa died at 42 from a massive heart attack (heart damage from Rheumatic Fever); Grandma at 75 from ovarian cancer.  Grandma had tb as a teen, lost a lung and was sent home to die at 15.  She began smoking after being widowed, and smoked 2 packs a day (menthol) to her death. All of the folks in her family smoked, and most of them lived long lives.  So there&#39;s some sense that maybe they (including my Mom) are somehow<br/>
 immune to smoking&#39;s effects.<br/>
 <br/>
I quit smoking in &#39;86, tho I&#39;ve been known to have the occasional cigarette thru the years since then.  Sometimes, on a cool spring morning, I smell a neighbor&#39;s cigarette (or my Mom visits) and I can literally taste that first drag, but I don&#39;t buy a pack.  I don&#39;t because Gary is allergic to smoke, because the kids think it&#39;s gross.  I wonder if I were single and childless, if I&#39;d be a smoker.  Most times, I think, probably yes.  I actually enjoyed smoking, except for the expense.  I only quit because I was looking for work as a secretary and didn&#39;t want to &#39;be a smoker.&#39;  It was about remaking myself, I think.  Then I met Gary and I couldn&#39;t smoke, so I don&#39;t.  Gary has never smoked a cigarette -- never even tried one. Neither do his parents or most of his extended family.  A few of his cousins smoke, I think.  <br/>
 <br/>
The inlaws would be just aghast to find out Will (my oldest) smokes.   They&#39;d never understand it as experimentation, or self-med of stress, etc.  I figure if he smokes, it&#39;s his life and health, and those are his choices to make.  If he gets hooked, he&#39;ll either quit or he won&#39;t.  We didn&#39;t want him smoking at home around Gary the younger boys, but I knew I couldn&#39;t tell him to not smoke at all, and expect compliance.  I wouldn&#39;t have bought cigarettes for him, but I didn&#39;t control how he spent his money when he lived at home.  I know he spent some on pot, some on beer.  I know we can&#39;t expect to control what our kids do outside our home, and that it&#39;s not fair to ban them from things we allow guests to do in our home.  My Mom doesn&#39;t smoke in the house --  no one smokes in our house, because of Gary&#39;s allergies and because we have small children.  <br/>
 <br/>
Ultimately, our kids are free agents who will do what they choose with their own bodies.  Telling them what they may not do just because we don&#39;t approve only invites more grief, and for a child who is feeling controlled, it may give them a reason to go to any lengths to defy a parent.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1345988643">When I was 16, I would BEG my  mother to let <br/>
me go buy her cigarettes so I could get out of the house and  DRIVE.  &lt;g&gt;  If it was legal for me to buy her beer I would have  begged for that, too!<br/>

My husband, Gary, remembers a party his parents had -- backyard cookout kind of thing. They ran out of beer, so his Dad tossed him the car keys, gave him a $20 and sent Gary out to the supermarket to buy more beer.  Only when he&#39;s in the checkout line with the beer and sees the guy ahead of him get carded, does it occur to Gary that he&#39;s only 16 (so it was 1971?) what is he doing out buying more beer?  Well, his Dad sent him out for beer, so he figures he&#39;ll buy it and hope he&#39;s not carded.  The checker rang it up without a word, and he went on home with the beer. It probably didn&#39;t hurt that he started shaving at 14, so maybe he looked 18, the legal age then.<br/>
<br/>
When he got home, he asked his Dad if it occurred to him that Gary was too young to buy beer.  Dad hadn&#39;t even thought about it, and was so embarrassed to realize what he&#39;d done.  He admitted he just never thought about it.<br/>
