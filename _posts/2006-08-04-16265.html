<div id="ygrps-yiv-1939923448">I also want to comment on this issue...<br/>
<br/>
this is from my own experience now seeing how unschooling is not only<br/>
liberating to the children but to the parents as well...  I have mentioned<br/>
before about my struggle with food addiction... now that I&#39;ve let up on all<br/>
food limitations (for myself also), I not only have stopped overeating but<br/>
no longer crave the foods that once controlled me.  McDonald&#39;s makes me sick<br/>
to think about, I may have chocolate every now and then... because it is now<br/>
a non-issue... it&#39;s no longer controls my thoughts and actions.<br/>
<br/>
I do know from listening to my body that I don&#39;t make the wisest choices<br/>
when I&#39;m tired, so I am extra careful after work not to overdo it on the<br/>
food...<br/>
<br/>
but I just want to get my voice out there on this issue because freedom is<br/>
really the best thing  :)<br/>
<br/>
