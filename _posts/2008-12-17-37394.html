I used to run in department store shoes, and suffered as a result.  I went to a running shoe store, spent about an hour with the owner, tried on multiple shoes, went for a short run in the possibles, and never regretted the higher purchase price.  Once I knew what I needed, I kept an eye out for the sales.<br/>

I swear I know Malila is a girl!! Sheesh.:)<br/>
<br/>
I watch the sales at department stores because they often clear out<br/>
last season&#39;s shoes for next to nothing. I just saw decent running<br/>
shoes for $10 at Belk. You don&#39;t get a lot of selection because they<br/>
carry about three styles of running shoes, not top of the line or<br/>
anything but it&#39;s worth checking sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
Sam&#39;s Club had shoes for under $20. If she&#39;s going to put a lot of<br/>
miles on them, it is worth investing a bit more. I know it can be hard<br/>
but triathlon tends to put a lot of miles on your equipment.<br/>
<br/>
Check out the RUN thing, I be La has it up now!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>To Faith: I&#39;ll second this, but only on second hand information. Avdi<br/>
(dh) was very serious one year about getting into good physical shape<br/>
and bought running shoes from a running shoe store in Pikesville, MD<br/>
(I can get you the name of the shop if you&#39;re interested). I thought<br/>
he was a nutter for having done so, but apparently there&#39;s something<br/>
to the whole getting the right kind of running shoe for the foot<br/>
wearing it. They look at how you run, which way your foot turns, and<br/>
so forth before they&#39;ll fit you. And then they fit you.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, so M&#39;s still a growing girl! But if she&#39;s serious about running,<br/>
especially in things like triathlons, then she should (IMO) be wearing<br/>
good shoes made for the purpose.<br/>
<br/>
And they can cost and arm and a leg... But there are sales, and<br/>
benevolent relatives, and bartering, and swapping, and various other<br/>
techniques I&#39;m sure you&#39;re familiar with.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I run and I&#39;ll agree that getting the right shoe is extremely  <br/>
important - it makes a LOT of difference in how comfortable you are.<br/>
<br/>
You can go to a running store find out all about your own foot - and  <br/>
which shoes are best for your foot - then buy last year&#39;s models on  <br/>
clearance. Also, if you get the right kind of shoe shape and support,  <br/>
the lower-end shoes are often just about as good as the ones that cost  <br/>
5 times more - the &quot;extras&quot; are nice, but not necessary.<br/>
