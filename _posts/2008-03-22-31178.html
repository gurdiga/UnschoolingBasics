**She doesn&#39;t like the putting them<br/>
back up part but will do it when she finds out that she won&#39;t get <br/>
computer<br/>
privileges or some other (dare I say it here &lt;BWG&gt;) punishment if she <br/>
doesn&#39;t.**<br/>
<br/>
It is just me and the kids and I realize I&#39;m stuck on the toilet with <br/>
no toilet paper! I go to change my son&#39;s diaper and realize I have <br/>
forgotten the wipes, or a replacement diaper. In these situations I <br/>
have to call my 4 y/o to bring me these things. She always is happily <br/>
willing. I wonder if this would be so if I punished her for not <br/>
picking her things up.<br/>
In our house we all help one another. If I see her toys, and they are <br/>
in my way. I pick them up, or offer creative ways we can do them <br/>
together. I show consideration for her things. Then when I have <br/>
accidentally left something out, I see the same consideration shown <br/>
to mine.<br/>

<br/>
With all due respect, threatening it is just as harsh as doing it<br/>
unless she believes you won&#39;t do it and if that&#39;s the case why bother?<br/>
 And IMO the real damage is being done by your lack of consistency.<br/>
If you say you will do something and then never do, how can she know<br/>
what you will and will not do?  How can she trust that anything you<br/>
say is the truth?  At all times you need to keep in mind that children<br/>
are egocentric.  That&#39;s how they are supposed to be.  She *will*<br/>
internalize anything you say or do.  Look back at your scars from<br/>
childhood and see the things through the eyes of your parents.  Then<br/>
look at how it feels or felt and you will see the difference. What you<br/>
see as being not harsh or a promise made and then backed out may not<br/>
be the same to your daughter.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, (I&#39;m a dog trainer and I work with OC.)  One of the<br/>
&quot;tools&quot; we have in our tool box with both people and animals is the<br/>
use of punishers or reinforcers (which may be + or -) and I&#39;m not<br/>
advocating the use of anything negative.  I bring it up to say this.<br/>
The subject (child, person, or animal) gets to decide if the punisher<br/>
is harsh or mild.  My daughter was abused, so yelling at her means<br/>
nothing.  She simply doesn&#39;t register it as anything worth paying<br/>
attention to.  My youngest son OTOH is incredibly sensitive and<br/>
yelling at him crushes him.  I can yell the same thing at both of them<br/>
&quot;STOP THAT NOW!&quot;  And they will each respond differently *because they<br/>
are different people with different needs*.  I can say &quot;Well yelling<br/>
isn&#39;t that bad, after all I got spankings and that&#39;s worse.&quot;  But I<br/>
don&#39;t get to make that call.  The subject of the punisher does.  What<br/>
seems mild to one person may seem blisteringly harsh to another.  And<br/>
the punisher doesn&#39;t get to decide.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, you don&#39;t know if she feels ill will towards you.  She<br/>
wouldn&#39;t tell you that.  You control the resources and she wants to<br/>
love you and be loved by you.  You could be damaging her and she&#39;s<br/>
just really good at hiding it.  I know you said you are working to<br/>
change it, and I applaud that.  We all have improvements we can make.<br/>
(And I know I&#39;ve got a LONG way to go yet.)  But your use of language<br/>
concerns me.  If this above is what you really think, it *sounds* to<br/>
me like you are negating all of what your daughter may perceive.<br/>
Imagine for a moment your wife sleeping with your best friend and<br/>
saying &quot;Oh, my husband doesn&#39;t mind at all!   He&#39;s totally OK with<br/>
it.&quot;  Wouldn&#39;t that be YOUR call to make?  And if you decided to keep<br/>
your mouth shut for the sake of peace and trying to put your marriage<br/>
back together, does that mean it doesn&#39;t bother you, really?<br/>
<br/>
I urge you to reconsider how you handle these issues, because kids<br/>
want and need to be able to count on their parents.<br/>

about practicing the philosophy of respect and trust. They&#39;re about  <br/>
building relationships.<br/>
<br/>
If someone posts an idea that leads away from those, it&#39;s going to be  <br/>
held up and examined.<br/>
<br/>
This bit gets pulled out every once in a while to explain how the  <br/>
list works:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The list is about ideas, not about people.<br/>
&gt; Think of ideas like balls and the list like a ball court. If someone<br/>
&gt; tosses an idea worth discussing into the court it&#39;s going to get<br/>
&gt; batted about. At that point what&#39;s going on is no longer about the<br/>
&gt; person who tossed the idea in. It&#39;s about the idea and how well and<br/>
&gt; cleanly it&#39;s being tossed about. (Unless the tosser keeps jumping in<br/>
&gt; and grabbing the idea ball saying &quot;Mine!&quot;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; but I definitely do not agree that I should be the one to pick up  <br/>
&gt; her toys when she is the one who got them out and knew that I  <br/>
&gt; desire her to pick them up if she leaves them out.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And most conventional parents would agree. Most conventional parents  <br/>
end up with teens who help begrudgingly.<br/>
<br/>
But when we fill them up with our willingness to be there for them,  <br/>
we become people they want to help.<br/>
<br/>
There are more relationship building ways of moving towards that idea  <br/>
than saying in effect &quot;You made the mess. Your responsibility to  <br/>
clean it up.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I used to say similar things. One day I spilled something and my  <br/>
daughter said &quot;You spilled it. You clean it up.&quot; That really felt  <br/>
yucky. What I would like to hear from anyone is &quot;Oh, let me help with  <br/>
that.&quot; So rather than focusing on who caused it, I focused on getting  <br/>
it cleaned up. Who did something is irrelevant.<br/>
<br/>
You can try reading<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://joyfullyrejoycing.com">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com</a><br/>
<br/>
down on the right are several pages about chores. They might help you  <br/>
to see what we&#39;re talking about. But you might not be ready for the  <br/>
info yet so it may not make sense.<br/>

<br/>
We just stayed the night at my parents.  Talk about pulling up<br/>
childhood pain.  It seems like there was a lot of resentment about<br/>
things.  I usually was scolded about my room and told that I was lazy,<br/>
not trying hard enough, disrespectful, etc.  I tried to tell Mom that<br/>
I get overwhelmed easily and she said, you just do it this way.<br/>
You&#39;ll do it when you want to.  I still hurt from that. 28 years later<br/>
I finally have practiced enough to go step-by-step and not be so<br/>
stressed out about messes.<br/>
<br/>
But I still need to be careful not to put resentment on my kids.  My<br/>
latest incident was blowing my top after finding lots of popcorn on<br/>
the floor for the third time or so in a day.  That was bad, but I<br/>
learned to walk with the kids through what they need. It takes<br/>
practice! :D<br/>
<br/>
I still feel like my parents put &quot;things&quot; ahead of me.  They can&#39;t<br/>
help because of something that &quot;has&quot; to be done, and it&#39;s easier to<br/>
see the &quot;benchmarks&quot; of clean laundry than a psychologically healthy<br/>
child.  Is it a generation thing?<br/>

Then why ever threaten it? It&#39;s a hollow threat. That will help her<br/>
learn you are unreliable and full of crap! If your threat works, and<br/>
she does the desired activity, she&#39;s learning that you aren&#39;t on her<br/>
side and when you want something done she better just do what you<br/>
want. Much better to be partners in figuring out solutions rather than<br/>
the big person manipulating the smaller person. Work together!<br/>

But, even so, I still remember the thoughts going through my head.<br/>

  I&#39;m sure my parents hoped I was thinking, &quot;Well, now I&#39;ve learned  <br/>
that fighting with my sisters isn&#39;t nice and, yeah, I hereby resolve  <br/>
not to do it anymore. And, thank goodness for my wonderful parents who  <br/>

<br/>
Not even close!<br/>
<br/>
  Most parents punish their kids and believe the kids will learn from  <br/>
that or, at least, be deterred by the negative reinforcement. But what  <br/>
kids are learning is not necessarily what the parents want them to  <br/>
learn. Humans are not like other animals - we don&#39;t like being  <br/>
&quot;trained&quot; and we respond by becoming apathetic, resistant, or  <br/>
compliant. None of those are good things because none let us be  <br/>
authentic.<br/>

 From my economist&#39;s point of view - it makes sense. If they reward  <br/>
them with a raisin for all the steps involved in solving a puzzle,  <br/>
then by the time they get close to actually solving it, they&#39;ve  <br/>
already had a number of raisins and  additional raisins are worth less  <br/>
to them, so they don&#39;t work as hard to get them. They&#39;re working for  <br/>
raisins, not for the value of solving the puzzle, and the raisins have  <br/>
diminishing marginal utility.<br/>

I wanted to mention two things about this.  The first is I don&#39;t<br/>
believe animals like to be trained either.  Unfortunately, if they<br/>
poop in the middle of the living room floor, most are exposed to<br/>
beatings or dumped at the animal shelter so they have little choice.<br/>
We humans, force the animals to conform to our way of living.  Just<br/>
because a dog follows you home doesn&#39;t mean he wants you to tie him on<br/>
a 3&#39; chain in the backyard.  So whether or not animals *enjoy* being<br/>
trained is up for major debate.  I know my clients&#39; pets enjoy seeing<br/>
me because when I come they are rewarded for being right.  I speak to<br/>
them in happy voices, ignore the failures and reward the correct steps<br/>
and always end on a positive note.  And they like that, but IMO what<br/>
they like is that I am *genuinely* happy to see them as they are.<br/>
With sloppy sits, with the occasional bite, and their incessant<br/>
barking.  Which is different than the regime under which they live.<br/>
<br/>
And punishers don&#39;t work with animals.  Not in the way we think they<br/>
do.  Punishment *NEVER* results in a predictable change in behavior.<br/>
Never.  Animals can learn not to get on the sofa by getting beaten<br/>
with the broom.  But they either associate the owner with intense<br/>
fear, or the couch.  Neither one of those ties the behavior of getting<br/>
ON the couch to the punishment.  I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s the same in<br/>
children but with kids I have only my own &quot;field study&quot; to draw on.<br/>
Whereas I can call myself an *expert* in behaviorism...for animals in<br/>
general but dogs and cats specifically.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>*******************************************************************************************************<br/>
 Well, I&#39;m sure anything is possible.  Whether it&#39;s probable or not is<br/>
another discussion entirely.  I think if you aren&#39;t familiar with Maslow&#39;s<br/>
work, you should look at it.  In fact I&#39;m going to copy it here because I<br/>
think it&#39;s very important to most of the RU concept.<br/>
<br/>
 Maslow has set up a hierarchy of five levels of basic needs. Beyond these<br/>
needs, higher levels of needs exist. These include needs for understanding,<br/>
esthetic appreciation and purely spiritual needs. In the levels of the five<br/>
basic needs, the person does not feel the second need until the demands of<br/>
the first have been satisfied, nor the third until the second has been<br/>
satisfied, and so on. Maslow&#39;s basic needs are as follows:<br/>
<br/>
*Physiological Needs*<br/>
These are biological needs. They consist of needs for oxygen, food, water,<br/>
and a relatively constant body temperature. They are the strongest needs<br/>
because if a person were deprived of all needs, the physiological ones would<br/>
come first in the person&#39;s search for satisfaction.<br/>
<br/>
*Safety Needs*<br/>
When all physiological needs are satisfied and are no longer controlling<br/>
thoughts and behaviors, the needs for security can become active. Adults<br/>
have little awareness of their security needs except in times of emergency<br/>
or periods of disorganization in the social structure (such as widespread<br/>
rioting). Children often display the signs of insecurity and the need to be<br/>
safe.<br/>
<br/>
*Needs of Love, Affection and Belongingness*<br/>
When the needs for safety and for physiological well-being are satisfied,<br/>
the next class of needs for love, affection and belongingness can emerge.<br/>
Maslow states that people seek to overcome feelings of loneliness and<br/>
alienation. This involves both giving and receiving love, affection and the<br/>
sense of belonging.<br/>
<br/>
*Needs for Esteem*<br/>
When the first three classes of needs are satisfied, the needs for esteem<br/>
can become dominant. These involve needs for both self-esteem and for the<br/>
esteem a person gets from others. Humans have a need for a stable, firmly<br/>
based, high level of self-respect, and respect from others. When these needs<br/>
are satisfied, the person feels self-confident and valuable as a person in<br/>
the world. When these needs are frustrated, the person feels inferior, weak,<br/>
helpless and worthless.<br/>
<br/>
*Needs for Self-Actualization*<br/>
When all of the foregoing needs are satisfied, then and only then are the<br/>
needs for self-actualization activated. Maslow describes self-actualization<br/>
as a person&#39;s need to be and do that which the person was &quot;born to do.&quot; &quot;A<br/>
musician must make music, an artist must paint, and a poet must write.&quot;<br/>
These needs make themselves felt in signs of restlessness. The person feels<br/>
on edge, tense, lacking something, in short, restless. If a person is<br/>
hungry, unsafe, not loved or accepted, or lacking self-esteem, it is very<br/>
easy to know what the person is restless about. It is not always clear what<br/>
a person wants when there is a need for self-actualization.<br/>
<br/>
The hierarchic theory is often represented as a pyramid, with the larger,<br/>
lower levels representing the lower needs, and the upper point representing<br/>
the need for self-actualization. Maslow believes that the only reason that<br/>
people would not move well in direction of self-actualization is because of<br/>
hindrances placed in their way by society. He states that education is one<br/>
of these hindrances. He recommends ways education can switch from its usual<br/>
person-stunting tactics to person-growing approaches. Maslow states that<br/>
educators should respond to the potential an individual has for growing into<br/>
a self-actualizing person of his/her own kind. Ten points that educators<br/>
should address are listed:<br/>
 1.)We should teach people to be authentic, to be aware of their inner<br/>
selves and to hear their inner-feeling voices.<br/>
2.)We should teach people to transcend their cultural conditioning and<br/>
become world citizens.<br/>
3.)We should help people discover their vocation in life, their calling,<br/>
fate or destiny. This is especially focused on finding the right career and<br/>
the right mate.<br/>
4.)We should teach people that life is precious, that there is joy to be<br/>
experienced in life, and if people are open to seeing the good and joyous in<br/>
all kinds of situations, it makes life worth living.<br/>
5.)We must accept the person as he or she is and help the person learn their<br/>
inner nature. From real knowledge of aptitudes and limitations we can know<br/>
what to build upon, what potentials are really there.<br/>
6.)We must see that the person&#39;s basic needs are satisfied. This includes<br/>
safety, belongingness, and esteem needs.<br/>
7.)We should refreshen consciousness, teaching the person to appreciate<br/>
beauty and the other good things in nature and in living.<br/>
8.)We should teach people that controls are good, and complete abandon is<br/>
bad. It takes control to improve the quality of life in all areas.<br/>
9.)We should teach people to transcend the trifling problems and grapple<br/>
with the serious problems in life. These include the problems of injustice,<br/>
of pain, suffering, and death.<br/>
10.)We must teach people to be good choosers. They must be given practice in<br/>
making good choices.<br/>
<br/>
Whether or not education can or would do these things is again another<br/>
subject all together.  We all know that education&#39;s end is to make all pegs<br/>
the exact same shape by using extreme pressure.  But Maslow&#39;s work is sound<br/>
IMO.<br/>

&gt; Oh gawd why did I even post LOL, this is quickly escalating to <br/>
&gt; Total Misinterpretation<br/>
<br/>
The discussions here aren&#39;t about you or about your daughter. They&#39;re <br/>
about practicing the philosophy of respect and trust. They&#39;re about <br/>
building relationships.<br/>
<br/>
If someone posts an idea that leads away from those, it&#39;s going to be <br/>
held up and examined.<br/>
<br/>
This bit gets pulled out every once in a while to explain how the <br/>
list works:<br/>
&gt; The list is about ideas, not about people.<br/>
&gt; Think of ideas like balls and the list like a ball court. If someone<br/>
&gt; tosses an idea worth discussing into the court it&#39;s going to get<br/>
&gt; batted about. At that point what&#39;s going on is no longer about the<br/>
&gt; person who tossed the idea in. It&#39;s about the idea and how well and<br/>
&gt; cleanly it&#39;s being tossed about. (Unless the tosser keeps jumping in<br/>
&gt; and grabbing the idea ball saying &quot;Mine!&quot;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; but I definitely do not agree that I should be the one to pick up <br/>
&gt; her toys when she is the one who got them out and knew that I <br/>
&gt; desire her to pick them up if she leaves them out.<br/>
<br/>
And most conventional parents would agree. Most conventional parents <br/>
end up with teens who help begrudgingly.<br/>
<br/>
But when we fill them up with our willingness to be there for them, <br/>
we become people they want to help.<br/>
<br/>
There are more relationship building ways of moving towards that idea <br/>
than saying in effect &quot;You made the mess. Your responsibility to <br/>
clean it up.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I used to say similar things. One day I spilled something and my <br/>
daughter said &quot;You spilled it. You clean it up.&quot; That really felt <br/>
yucky. What I would like to hear from anyone is &quot;Oh, let me help with <br/>
that.&quot; So rather than focusing on who caused it, I focused on getting <br/>
it cleaned up. Who did something is irrelevant.<br/>
<br/>
You can try reading<br/>
<br/>
http://joyfullyrejo ycing.com<br/>
<br/>
down on the right are several pages about chores. They might help you <br/>
to see what we&#39;re talking about. But you might not be ready for the <br/>
info yet so it may not make sense.<br/>

~~often I never follow through with it at all,~~<br/>
<br/>
Then why ever threaten it? It&#39;s a hollow threat. That will help her<br/>
learn you are unreliable and full of crap! If your threat works, and<br/>
she does the desired activity, she&#39;s learning that you aren&#39;t on her<br/>
side and when you want something done she better just do what you<br/>
want. Much better to be partners in figuring out solutions rather than<br/>
the big person manipulating the smaller person. Work together!<br/>

What are we misinterpreting?<br/>
Your own words stated that if your dd doesn&#39;t pick up the toys in the<br/>
hallway (when they get pretty messy) you threaten to take away her<br/>
computer time in order to get her to do what you want. Anything<br/>
missing there?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We&#39;re not discussing you, and not your daughter. We&#39;re discussing the  <br/>
ideas you put onto the list.<br/>
<br/>
If someone pulls the ideas from your emails and tries them at home  <br/>
they&#39;re going to have an adversarial relationship with their child.<br/>
<br/>
There may be something you&#39;re doing with your daughter that isn&#39;t  <br/>
coming through. Maybe your and your daughter have a deeper  <br/>
understanding of each other. Maybe your daughter&#39;s personality is  <br/>
such that she has a more adult view of the world (even if she doesn&#39;t  <br/>
have the ability to follow through). Maybe she has a need to appear  <br/>
to agree with you to make you happy. Maybe there are relationship  <br/>
effects you aren&#39;t seeing in your daughter because you&#39;re focused on  <br/>
getting her to see she needs to clean up her messes.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever it is, the idea you sent can&#39;t be taken by someone on the  <br/>
list to use in their family and build a relationship with. The ideas  <br/>
need to be useable and understandable by anyone who wants them and  <br/>
not dependent on compliant personalities or whatever to work.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When kids are called &quot;little angels&quot; it most often means behaving in  <br/>
a way that makes mom happy. Obedient. Quiet. If that&#39;s the goal, it&#39;s  <br/>
much better to get a dog of a breed that&#39;s not an independent  <br/>
thinker. Retrievers are good I think, but Kelly could come up with a  <br/>
whole good list :-)<br/>
<br/>
The goal of unschooling is build relationships, give them a safe  <br/>
environment to grow and explore in. It&#39;s to nurture who they are, not  <br/>
to mold them into something we can show off to the neighbors.<br/>
<br/>

ask yourself &quot;Why not? Who&#39;s going to die?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Even better is to catch yourself way sooner. Even better is to  <br/>
anticipate problems and take care of them before they get to the  <br/>
yelling stage. Make sure she&#39;s well fed. Avoid situations she can&#39;t  <br/>
handle. (If she&#39;s acting like she &quot;shouldn&#39;t&quot; and you&#39;ve given her a  <br/>
gentle reminder, it&#39;s a good clue she&#39;s too young.)<br/>
<br/>
That won&#39;t eliminate all problems but it will cut way back and give  <br/>
you more energy and patience for the problems you didn&#39;t foresee.<br/>

<br/>
So when she runs into a problem in life (pressure to have sex  <br/>
perhaps) and she fears what you&#39;ll do or say because it&#39;s going  <br/>
against what you want her to do, where will she go? Who will she turn  <br/>
to?<br/>

needs, the further down on the pyramid the needs aren&#39;t getting met,  <br/>
the more difficult it is.<br/>
<br/>
Depends lots on personality and how someone was raised too. If  <br/>
someone was raised deprived, or raised needing to fight for what they  <br/>
needed, a threat to a need is more likely to make them turn inward  <br/>
and protect themselves at others&#39; expense.<br/>

Too many factors to judge how an individual will react or to make  <br/>
sweeping judgments about how people will react. But it&#39;s certainly  <br/>
*possible* if the factors are right.<br/>
