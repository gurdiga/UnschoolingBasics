<div id="ygrps-yiv-1204016460">I&#39;ve been thinking alot and discussing unschooling as a lifestyle with <br/>
my husband.  We&#39;re both happy with how things are right now but we&#39;re <br/>
both wondering about the future.  Last night, I realized I was still <br/>
holding onto the idea that my children would reach a point in their <br/>
teen years where they&#39;d get serious about school and choose a program <br/>
to complete that would help them toward their goals, i.e. college or <br/>
other life work.  Now, I&#39;ve not been consciously thinking this, but <br/>
through talking with my DH, I felt silly that the thought was still <br/>
there in the back of my mind.  I had to ask aloud, &#39;What if my <br/>
children never choose to do anything that looks schoolish in my <br/>

 </span></blockquote>In all honesty?  Unschool yourself.  Find your passions.  Indulge in<br/>
your passions.  Find that thing in life that brings you joy!  Look<br/>
back at your life and ask yourself if you are doing the things that<br/>
were schooled to do.  Ask yourself if you are doing anything with all<br/>
the schooling that you took.  Look at all the things that you are<br/>
doing and ask if they are a result of schooling or passion.  I can&#39;t<br/>
tell you the number of people I meet who have a degree in &quot;thus in<br/>
such&quot; but they are working in a totally unrelated field.  They did<br/>
their obligatory four years (or for some of us it was  more like 5 or<br/>
6 LOL!) and got out and realized that they really didn&#39;t want to be an<br/>
accountant, a history teacher, a biologist, a sociologist, an<br/>
engineer, a school teacher, etc etc etc.  I knew a girl in college who<br/>
wanted to study math.  She loved numbers.  She loved solving puzzles.<br/>
Her parents pushed and pushed her to get a teaching degree because<br/>
&quot;there is no money in mathematics.&quot;  She got her teaching degree,<br/>
lasted 3 weeks in the classroom and promptly went back to college and<br/>
took all the math classes she could.  She didn&#39;t finish a &quot;degree<br/>
program&quot; but she took math classes.  I lost track of her for a number<br/>
of years but I ran into a mutual friend recently who hears from her<br/>
regularly.  Guess what she does?  She&#39;s a mathematician with the<br/>
FBI!!!!  If you have seen the show Numb3rs, that&#39;s the sort of work<br/>
she does.  She LOVES it.<br/>
<br/>
My co-parent is another prime example of someone who unschooled<br/>
himself.  He&#39;s a self-taught computer geek (and he finds that term a<br/>
compliment!)  He&#39;s doing that thing that he is passionate about.  He<br/>
loves all the different aspects of computers and reads programming<br/>
books and tech manuals like my kids read manga!  I&#39;ve watched his eyes<br/>
light up and get all excited when he learns a new way to manipulate a<br/>
program or piece of hardware.  No degree and he says that he just<br/>
cannot think of quitting his job because it is so multi-dimensional<br/>
finding another job that pays what this one does would be nearly<br/>
impossible.  Secretly I think he likes it because they let him have<br/>
all the newest gadgets, toys, OSes, and he has 6 (or maybe it is 8)<br/>
computer monitors in his office all hooked to 4 conjoined computers.<br/>
Yes; totally unschooled since he barely squeaked out of public school<br/>
and living his passion!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-300728141">By focusing on the Now instead of the Not Yet. By letting go <br/>
of &quot;what ifs&quot; and thinking about the &quot;what is&quot;. All those &#39;what ifs&#39; <br/>
are old fears surfacing. All those old messages about <br/>
being &quot;productive&quot; and all. So, take them out and look at them. What <br/>
is the worst that could happen if the kids -never- did anything that <br/>
looks schoolish? What&#39;s the worst that can happen if they wait until <br/>
they&#39;re 25 to think about college? (which is what my DH did - we <br/>
were already married by then). Is there *anything* joyful and life-<br/>
affirming and, okay, &quot;productive&quot; that you can do now about that? <br/>
For instance, in a different vein but similar idea, &quot;what if DS <br/>
falls and breaks an arm?&quot; Okay, I can fret and stew and over-protect <br/>
him OR I can learn proper first aid, keep a stocked first aid kit <br/>
handy, have splint materials available, have some way to reach <br/>
emergency medical help, and so on. Then let life happen. (BTW he&#39;s <br/>
now 8 and has had two broken bones already. DH and I are both CPR <br/>
and first aid certified) In other words, I can let fear run our <br/>
lives or I can prepare as much as possible and then LIVE life. Also, <br/>
if you are doing things for your own self (knitting, gardening, cake <br/>
decorating, tae kwon doh, scuba diving, whatever) you&#39;ll have less <br/>
time for stewing AND you&#39;ll be bringing new ideas, people, places, <br/>
events into the lives of your family.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks Deb and Michelle.  You both make lots of sense.  I like Deb&#39;s <br/>
way of putting it, that I should live in the &#39;now&#39; with &#39;what is&#39; <br/>
and not worry about &#39;what if&#39;.  And Michelle, I kid you not, I have <br/>
NO idea what passions I might have.  My mother was/is very big into <br/>
marriage and family.  She raised me to find a husband who would <br/>
support me and let me stay home with the kids.  She just doesn&#39;t <br/>
understand women who choose to work if they have the option of <br/>
staying home because all she&#39;s ever wanted to do is stay home.  But <br/>
she was never the type of involved parent I am.  She did her own <br/>
things, either watching television all day, or chatting with her <br/>
friends, the moms of my friends.  She&#39;s perfectly content if she has <br/>
a tv, cable box and a refrigerator.  That&#39;s not my style, though I <br/>
love being home with my children.  She&#39;s in awe that I am so <br/>
involved in their lives but she worries I won&#39;t be able to let go <br/>
when they are ready to &quot;leave the nest&quot;.  I hate that term.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Finding my interests is more overwhelming than curriculum decisions <br/>
when I was doing strict school at home!  *lol*  The only passion <br/>
I&#39;ve had since being a child was becoming a mom.  I&#39;d love to have <br/>
more children but my DH is done, done and done.  But no worries, I <br/>
look forward to being a grandmother.  But I&#39;ve been in baby-<br/>
making/wanting mode for so long that I don&#39;t recall ever having any <br/>
other desire.  My college days were kind of cool.  I loved being in <br/>
class.  But I was working toward a degree because I remember my <br/>
daddy telling me that if I wanted to be somebody, I needed to get a <br/>
college degree.  He passed away 17 years ago and I am still playing <br/>
that record in my head even though I don&#39;t believe it from a logical <br/>
point of view.  I feel like the whole world is open before me and I <br/>
only need to take a step forward to begin, yet I hold back <br/>
because ... I don&#39;t know why to be honest.  Nothing sounds <br/>
interesting enough but that sounds like an excuse.<br/>
<br/>
My latest passion is beating Paper Mario The 1000 Year Door for <br/>
Nintendo Gamecube.  I&#39;ll just focus on that and not worry about <br/>
everything else right now.  :)<br/>

 I had to ask aloud, &#39;What if my<br/>
 children never choose to do anything that looks schoolish in my<br/>
 eyes?&#39;<br/>
<br/>
 How can new unschoolers get past this traditional thinking?<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Thinking about what *you* do that&#39;s schoolish might help.<br/>
<br/>
  I can&#39;t think of anything &quot;schoolish&quot; that I do on a regular or <br/>
semi-regular basis. Well, I read. I write. I let Ben do my taxes. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  But school-thinking is not a part of our grown-up lives. Why should it <br/>
be a part of a child&#39;s?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  OH! I *do* help my best friend who is the head of a private school for <br/>
children with learning differences. I give her ideas. She bounces <br/>
things off me. But she&#39;s pretty alternative----still it&#39;s school-like <br/>
thinking, but it doesn&#39;t touch my *real* life in any way---just makes <br/>
me more aware of what&#39;s happening in alternative schools.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 But---what do *you* really do that looks schoolish?<br/>
<br/>
  A life filled with passion (as the other posters suggested) is the <br/>
best way to get past it yourself. But also looking at your life and <br/>
what&#39;s schoolish about it might too.<br/>

  &quot;The hardest problem for the brain is not learning, but forgetting. No <br/>
matter how hard we try, we can&#39;t deliberately forget something we have <br/>
learned, and that is catastrophic if we learn that we can&#39;t learn.&quot; <br/>
