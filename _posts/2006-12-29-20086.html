<div id="ygrps-yiv-1549797007">What works for us; <br/>
 <br/>
Avoid eating out or buying drinks when you are out. Pack snacks and lunches  <br/>
in a cooler if you are out for the day. Stock up on convenience foods for <br/>
those  nights you don&#39;t want to cook. I also swear by <br/>
_http://www.thegrocerygame.com_ (http://www.thegrocerygame.com)  it is a  paid site that lists each weeks <br/>
sales and corresponding coupons. It has cut my  weekly grocery budget in half. <br/>
What used to be $150 a week is now $75 and  sometimes less but now I am <br/>
buying brand names instead of generic. It sounds  like an infomercial but it really <br/>
works, the site teaches you how to shop the  sales and stock up. So now I do <br/>
the same in other areas of our lives. When my  family&#39;s favorite jeans are on <br/>
sale I stock up, 4-6 pairs for dh and 2 pairs for  each child. You get the <br/>
idea!<br/>
 <br/>
If you register at the grocery game please put my email in as your  referrer, <br/>
_hslater351@..._ (mailto:hslater351@...)  , if I  refer three people <br/>
I get my list free for a month. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m  aware that this seems to be off the &#39;unschooling&#39; topic, but I<br/>
think this  is going to be fun for the family to be more creative with<br/>
our food and  money.<br/>
