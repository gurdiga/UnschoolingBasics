<div id="ygrps-yiv-1613082058">In &quot;light&quot; of the intense discussions that we&#39;ve been having lately <br/>
I thought this post was both suitable and humorous.  I saw it on <br/>
another list I belong to.  I hope you enjoy it...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How many list members does it takes to change a light bulb?<br/>
<br/>
One to change the light bulb and to post that the light bulb has been<br/>
changed.<br/>
<br/>
Fourteen to share similar experiences of changing light bulbs and how<br/>
the light bulb could have been changed differently.<br/>
<br/>
Seven to caution about the dangers of changing light bulbs.<br/>
<br/>
Seven more to point out spelling/grammar errors in posts about<br/>
changing light bulbs.<br/>
<br/>
Five to flame the spell checkers.<br/>
<br/>
Three to correct spelling/grammar flames.<br/>
<br/>
Six to argue over whether it&#39;s &quot;lightbulb&quot; or &quot;light bulb&quot; ...<br/>
another six to condemn those six as stupid.<br/>
<br/>
Fifteen to claim experience in the lighting industry and give the<br/>
correct spelling.<br/>
<br/>
Nineteen to post that this group is not about light bulbs and to<br/>
please take this discussion to a lightbulb (or light bulb) forum.<br/>
<br/>
Eleven to defend the posting to the group saying that we all use<br/>
light bulbs and therefore the posts are relevant to this group.<br/>
<br/>
Thirty six to debate which method of changing light bulbs is<br/>
superior, where to buy the best light bulbs, what brand of light<br/>
bulbs work best for this technique and what brands are faulty<br/>
<br/>
Seven to post URLs where one can see examples of different light<br/>
bulbs.<br/>
<br/>
Four to post that the URLs were posted incorrectly and then post the<br/>
corrected URL.<br/>
<br/>
Three to post about links they found from the URLs that are relevant<br/>
to this group which makes light bulbs relevant to this group.<br/>
<br/>
Thirteen to link all posts to date, quote them in their entirety<br/>
including all headers and signatures, and add &quot;Me too&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Five to post to the group that they will no longer post because they<br/>
cannot handle the light bulb controversy.<br/>
<br/>
Four to say &quot;didn&#39;t we go through this already a short time ago?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Thirteen to say &quot;do a Google search on light bulbs before posting<br/>
questions about light bulbs&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Three to tell a funny story about their show dog and a light bulb.<br/>
<br/>
AND<br/>
<br/>
One group lurker to respond to the original post 6 months from now<br/>
and start it all over again.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1694383579">I saw this on another list too - my response was the following:<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t forget the 1 troll who compares lightbulb changers to Hitler,<br/>
one to call Godwin&#39;s Law on the troll and a whole new set of members<br/>
to spin off on a flamewar on hitler or Godwin&#39;s Law :)<br/>
