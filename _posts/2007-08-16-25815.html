<div id="ygrps-yiv-191301461">A few years ago, Julian took a course at Harvard Extension called Evolution  <br/>
and Society, and we all learned tons. Yeah, Darwin was a product of his times, <br/>
 and there are things he said that were sexist and racist by our definitions. <br/>
 Particularly on the racism part, though, he also had some pretty enlightened <br/>
 views for his time. One of Julian&#39;s papers for the class, actually, was &quot;Was <br/>
 Darwin Racist?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Would your daughter have any interest in talking via e-mail or otherwise  <br/>
with Julian? Certainly not to change her mind, but just because she might be  <br/>
interested?  Are you folks going to be at Live and Learn?<br/>

thank you for the offer, she may take Julian up on it.<br/>
