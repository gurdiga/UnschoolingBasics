<div id="ygrps-yiv-651208299">So much of what I read about unschooling seems to be geared toward <br/>
younger children like under the age of 10.  What about families who <br/>
are wanting to move into this lifestyle with older children?  Do you <br/>
think it&#39;s more difficult or easier, or does it even matter?  <br/>
<br/>
My oldest is 15 and in high school.  She doesn&#39;t have any interest <br/>
in homeschooling even though there are many things she doesn&#39;t like <br/>
about school.  I&#39;ve always supported her needs and wants though and <br/>
I don&#39;t push the school&#39;s agenda.  I believe it&#39;s all her choice and <br/>
I do my best to just be here for her as she needs me.  Her wish is <br/>
to go to culinary school and she likes the food & nutrition program <br/>
at school.  Her dad (we&#39;re divorced) wants her to be in AP classes <br/>
and preparing for college but she doesn&#39;t want that.  Poor thing.  <br/>
She walks a very fine line between what she wants and what she knows <br/>
her dad wants for her.  <br/>
<br/>
My other two are ages 9 and 11.  My dd9 has spent some time in <br/>
public school by her choice and then she came home when she was <br/>
tired of it.  That was last September actually.  Since then we&#39;ve <br/>
tried some different curricula but nothing that has sparked an <br/>
interest.  While I haven&#39;t forced things, I haven&#39;t let go either.  <br/>
My ds11 has been using a traditional textbook program.  He likes <br/>
structure and routine and has mostly enjoyed the work though I know <br/>
he&#39;d much prefer to just stop doing it altogether.  Again, I have <br/>
trouble letting go.  I&#39;ve reached the point though where I am <br/>
dreading pulling out materials.  I find other things to do and on <br/>
those days the kids and I are happy.  But I always keep the school <br/>
stuff in the back of my mind.  It&#39;s like I feel okay taking a couple <br/>
of days off because I know we can catch up later.  I&#39;d like to let <br/>
that go completely.  I feel like it&#39;s too late in the game for us <br/>
but surely it&#39;s not.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve ordered a couple of books to read and have been rereading my <br/>
other favorites.  I love Rue Kream&#39;s Parenting a Free Child and <br/>
Alison McKee&#39;s Homeschooling Our Children Unschooling Ourselves.  <br/>
And yet as many times as I&#39;ve read those books I can&#39;t seem to let <br/>
go and become a true unschooler.  We have unschooling periods that <br/>
have lasted several months at a time.  How do I make it a forever <br/>
lifestyle rather than vacations?  Does that even make sense?  :)<br/>

through spells of &quot;vacations&quot; then I get scared that they may fall <br/>

<br/>
A comfortable transitional attitude for you might be to choose to<br/>
unschool for one year, rather than forever. Then the anxieties you may<br/>
continue to have about &quot;falling behind&quot; academically may be balanced<br/>
by the liklihood that your dd will be &quot;getting ahead&quot; spiritually and<br/>
emotionally. Then in another year you can see where you&#39;re at and go<br/>
from there.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-360367416">Ok hopefully this post wont end up too scatterbrained and tie together in the end. I cant claim to be an experienced unschooler because my oldest is 8 but hopefully my experience will be somewhat relevant anyway. <br/>
   <br/>
  First I was honest with my 8 year old and told her if you choose to go back to school in 3rd or 4th or whenever they may consider you behind in some areas. This does not mean you are dumb in any way it simply means that you didnt study what the government decided you should study at a certain time. <br/>
   <br/>
  Unschooling imo dosent mean that one never uses a textbook of any kind. It just dosent in any way limit them to learing by textbooks. When I was 14 I left the us for a year as an exchange student in finland. During the year I traveled to many countries and did almost no schoolwork but wow it would take pages to describe all I experienced and learned. However, I came back to the US and was &quot;behind&quot; at school. <br/>
   <br/>
  At 18 I decided I wanted to go to nursing school and spent about 9 days studying for the entrance exam. Me and my lovely d average in highschool aced it and I was accepted to one of 20 spots out of 200 applying that year. <br/>
   <br/>
  My daughter decided to make muffins the other day. She thought the recipe said 1-2 cups of milk when it was actually calling for one half cup. She learned so much more about fractions that day than all the little worksheet shading exercises on fractions she has done. She also learned something I consider very valuable...mistakes are simply learning experiences and usualy not a big deal. We added more dry ingredients to make up for the extra milk and got a double batch of muffins. yum! <br/>
   <br/>
  Do I worry that my kids will get behind? Yes there is always that nagging little voice in the back of my mind. Most if not all of us have been conditioned since childhood that we are supposed to follow the standard path....study what we are told no matter how uninteresting it is at that particular time , get good grades and go to college, enter into the standard hetrosexual marriage and have 2.2 children. <br/>
   <br/>
  Another poster suggested taking it a year at a time. This is what we are doing right now. <br/>
  Another thing Im starting is keeping a scrapbook and journal. I plan to use it to go back over the year and realize wow my kids did cover a lot and have something to show certain overconcerned family members that are sure to flip a lid when they find out we are unschooling. &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
   <br/>
  One more thing ....this is something that Im working on with my own children right now so please dont take it as an attack. You gotta show your children that you truly trust them to learn what they need when they need/want to. If you get away from the books and they seem to do nothing but play x-box for 3 months and then you get back to the books they see mom is gonna let us have a break for a while but then she is gonna get all crazy on us again &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
   <br/>
  So sit back and relax. give help if they ask in the way they want the help. Offer help but prepared to step back if they decline. When the behind monster starts to show herslef feed her some choclate, bite your tongue, take up a new hobby and go read lots of unschooling stuff. I highly suggest Sandra Dodd&#39;s website. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I really wouldn&#39;t talk about going back to school - I mean, it  <br/>
happens, but not often enough for that to be a concern at the very  <br/>
beginning of your homeschooling journey.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Unschooling imo dosent mean that one never uses a textbook of any  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Even schooled kids are not limited to learning by textbooks. (In fact,  <br/>
my oldest daughter went to school for 5 years and never had a single  <br/>
textbook in all that time, so there are schools that don&#39;t use  <br/>
textbooks at all.)  If someone was relying on using textbooks as a  <br/>
backup to make sure their kids don&#39;t get behind, that is contrary to  <br/>
unschooling philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Eventually you might discover you are living as if there is no such  <br/>
thing as school, and you won&#39;t have that little voice in your head  <br/>
anymore. It isn&#39;t inevitable that we even know what school kids are  <br/>
being taught (notice I don&#39;t say &quot;learning) in school. The more you  <br/>
can ignore it, just not know, the better.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Another poster suggested taking it a year at a time. This is what we  <br/>
&gt; are doing right now.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure what taking it a year at a time entails, but if it keeps  <br/>
you thinking about whether or not the kids are &quot;behind&quot; then it might  <br/>
not be such a great idea.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

&gt; members that are sure to flip a lid when they find out we are  <br/>
&gt; unschooling. &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What if they don&#39;t do anything that results in output that can go into  <br/>
the scrapbook? Is that going to concern you? I mean, what if their  <br/>
year involves many hours of movie watching, game playing,  <br/>
conversation, and pretend play? Scrapbook implies some kind of product  <br/>
to put into it.<br/>
<br/>
Journaling is an excellent idea - just don&#39;t feel that what you  <br/>
journal about has to be &quot;educational.&quot; Write things that the kids do,  <br/>
listen to, watch, talk about, visit, play, make, create, and so on.  <br/>
And don&#39;t feel bad if, after a while, you no longer feel the need to  <br/>
keep it up. As you feel fully confident that the kids are always  <br/>
learning, you might not feel like spending your time documenting it  <br/>
anymore.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; One more thing ....this is something that Im working on with my own  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Good advice.<br/>
Just one quibble - &quot;get away from the books?&quot; I think you meant get  <br/>
away from required schoolwork, but my kids would really object to  <br/>
equating &quot;books&quot; with &quot;schoolwork.&quot;<br/>

child-directed, child-initiated, child-driven? That&#39;s not enough.  <br/>
Parents should work pretty darn hard (it might be really fun, but it  <br/>
takes energy, time, commitment) to create an exciting and stimulating  <br/>
rich and wonderful world for the children to experience.<br/>

is trying to give them the best vacation imaginable. Forget totally  <br/>
about whether they are learning what they need to learn - that will  <br/>
take care of itself, really.<br/>

So much of what I read about unschooling seems to be geared toward<br/>
younger children like under the age of 10.  What about families who<br/>
are wanting to move into this lifestyle with older children?  Do you<br/>
think it&#39;s more difficult or easier, or does it even matter?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny: This week, it&#39;s all about littluns. But three weeks ago it <br/>
was about teens and drinking or sex or drugs. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It all comes and goes! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Our story began when Cameron was 12 and we took him out of a private <br/>
prep school after sixth grade. He just turned 20 last month.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s been a LOT easier with his younger brother, Duncan, now <br/>
almost 12 and always unschooled.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve ordered a couple of books to read and have been rereading my<br/>
other favorites.  I love Rue Kream&#39;s Parenting a Free Child and<br/>
Alison McKee&#39;s Homeschooling Our Children Unschooling Ourselves.<br/>
And yet as many times as I&#39;ve read those books I can&#39;t seem to let<br/>
go and become a true unschooler.  We have unschooling periods that<br/>
have lasted several months at a time.  How do I make it a forever<br/>
lifestyle rather than vacations?  Does that even make sense?  :)<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Where do you live?<br/>
<br/>
We may be able to hool you up with other unshcoolers nearby.<br/>
<br/>
And is it possible for you to make it to an unschooling conference? We <br/>
have quite a few this year. That would make a HUGE difference!!<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also Not Back to School Camp.<br/>

<br/>
Great encouraging post, thank you!  I quoted the above because it has <br/>
definitely been an issue for me in the past.  But my reasoning, er <br/>
excuse, is boredom.  I love your idea of a journal and perhaps I <br/>
should write myself a letter to place at the front of it explaining <br/>
why I believe this is the right thing to do so I can reread it when <br/>
we&#39;re feeling bored.<br/>

My  oldest is 15 and in high school.  She doesn&#39;t have any interest <br/>
in  homeschooling even though there are many things she doesn&#39;t like <br/>
about  school.  I&#39;ve always supported her needs and wants though and <br/>
I don&#39;t  push the school&#39;s agenda.  I believe it&#39;s all her choice and <br/>
I do my  best to just be here for her as she needs me.  Her wish is <br/>
to go to  culinary school and she likes the food & nutrition program <br/>
at  school.  Her dad (we&#39;re divorced) wants her to be in AP classes <br/>
and  preparing for college but she doesn&#39;t want that.  Poor thing.   <br/>
She walks a very fine line between what she wants and what she knows  <br/>
her dad wants for her.  <br/>
<br/>

that is SO us! Grace is 15, and she decided finaly, to leave HS and be  home, <br/>
unschooling. It&#39;s a process, and it&#39;s ok. My older son, 18, did something  <br/>
similar, and the basic guide, of deschooling taking place for about 1 month for  <br/>
each year schooled was nearly dead-on with James :) After 13 months of no  <br/>
schooling, he began really enjoying looking things up on his own, finding more  <br/>
interests and becoming fully himself. Grace is still in the process and I <br/>
expect  it to take some time. But your daughter could begin following those ideas <br/>
if she  were NOT in school - but I know that&#39;s tough. Grace didn&#39;t want to <br/>
leave school  because she has the (wrong) impression that homeschoolers were <br/>
&quot;losers.&quot; It&#39;s  REALLY hard at times - her Dad wants to see her work, hold it in <br/>
his hands, get  reports from me, all of that - so it&#39;s a toughie, but we&#39;re <br/>
figuring it out.  Good luck to you all! <br/>
