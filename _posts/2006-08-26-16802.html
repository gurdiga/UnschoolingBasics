<div id="ygrps-yiv-395767239">Hi everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I am totally new to the idea of unschooling and have been &quot;lurking&quot; <br/>
on this site for a couple of weeks.  I think I understand the <br/>
educational side of unschooling and am seeing my DS start to become <br/>
much more curious and even wanting to learn more.  But the parenting <br/>
part is what I am having trouble grasping.  Here is my example:  <br/>
Today DS5 (almost 6) went shopping for a new soccer ball before his <br/>
first practice.  He was very excited and we had a good time while he <br/>
picked out the one he wanted.  Then it was time to go to the <br/>
register and pay.  I started to go one way and he started to go back <br/>
the way we had came.  So, I turned around and started following him. <br/>
He got upset because he wanted us each to go a different way and <br/>
meet at the registers. I told him we could go either way, but we had <br/>
to go together because it was a big store and it was very busy <br/>
today. He then takes off running toward the register and I just <br/>
walked to them, thinking he would be waiting in one of the lines <br/>
when I got there, But he wasn&#39;t.  I calmly (at least on the outside) <br/>
looked at my watch and walked up and down and around the registers <br/>
for 5 minutes.  Then I asked a cashier to help me find him.  Using <br/>
her walkie talkie another worker found him under a display.  <br/>
<br/>
How would the unschooling parent handle this?  I picked him up, <br/>
leaving the soccer ball behind and we left the store.  When we got <br/>
home I put him in his room and when I had calmed down,  I asked him <br/>
to tell me what he had done wrong and why it was wrong. He told me <br/>
running away and hiding and he knew that it scared me and that he <br/>
was supposed to stay with me because it wasn&#39;t safe for him to go <br/>
off alone in a store. I also told him that he would have to just use <br/>
his old soccer ball for soccer this year.  How do you handle times <br/>
when they just need to do what you say?  I really feel like this was <br/>
a safety issue and wanted some opinions on how you would have <br/>
handled this.<br/>

origionaly plan and gone a different route.  Perhaps you could have<br/>
negotiated and said, &quot;OK, you go your way and I&#39;ll go mine.  Let&#39;s see<br/>
who can make it to register 7 the fastest.&quot;  (doesn&#39;t matter if<br/>
register 7 is open or not, that is just your meeting place.)  I bet he<br/>
would have been thrilled to have been trusted to get to the checkout<br/>
lines on his own *and* he would have been waiting for you at register<br/>
7 (or vice versa - in my family I would have purposely gone a bit<br/>
slower to make it after him unless he was doing an experiment in<br/>
distance and route.)  He knew where to go and obviously felt<br/>
comfortable with where he was.  Although it is scary to let go of<br/>
sight of our children, sometimes we need to do this for them as long<br/>
as we know that they are going to be safe.  I&#39;ve many times had an<br/>
independent child want to do something &quot;on their own&quot; and been in the<br/>
distant background where I could still see them, yet they had the<br/>
belief that they were independent.  going to the bathroom was a big<br/>
one for me, especially when I had a son who didn&#39;t want to go into the<br/>
&quot;girl&quot; bathroom anymore.  I remember my trepidation at letting my son<br/>
go to the bathroom alone the first time at Disney when his father<br/>
wasn&#39;t with us to &quot;go too.&quot;  Even though I could see the bathroom door<br/>
from where I stood and watched it like a hawk, I still was<br/>
apprehensive.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes we still make decisions with that former non-unschooling<br/>
mind and we need to step back and ask ourselves for a minute &quot;how<br/>
would an unschooler handle this?&quot;  (I&#39;ve heard it called on this list,<br/>
&quot;WWRenD&quot; or &quot;WWRueD&quot; or &quot;WWKellyD&quot;).  It&#39;s ok to tell your child,<br/>
&quot;Give me a minute to think this through&quot; or &quot;Help me think this<br/>
through so we have a plan!&quot;<br/>

I&#39;m still fairly new to this RU stuff, too, but some things in your post <br/>
jumped out at me:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I told him we could go either way, but we had<br/>
&gt;to go together because it was a big store and it was very busy<br/>
&gt;today. He then takes off running toward the register and I just<br/>
&gt;walked to them, thinking he would be waiting in one of the lines<br/>
&gt;when I got there, But he wasn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>**My son occasionally does things like this (mostly like running in the <br/>
parking lot or something like that) and I have just learned to anticipate <br/>
that he will usually do this when I&#39;m wanting to control him in that <br/>
situation. For example, he&#39;ll want to walk &quot;all by himself&quot; but we&#39;re in a <br/>
parking lot that is a little busier so I&#39;ll ask him to stay close or hold on <br/>
to the cart or hold my hand, etc., and from experience I know that he&#39;ll <br/>
want to &quot;push&quot; back when I do that so he darts away. Now I&#39;m trying to do <br/>
things differently like just giving him a reminder that &quot;we&#39;re in a busy <br/>
parking lot&quot; when  we&#39;re getting out of the car and he&#39;ll automatically hold <br/>
my hand (I don&#39;t even have to ask!). On the occasions when he doesn&#39;t hold <br/>
my hand and just wants to walk by himself I&#39;ll just stick very close behind <br/>
him or will walk extra briskly so that I can catch him if a car is coming.<br/>
<br/>
**In your situation in the store I would have done what you did in reminding <br/>
him that the store was very busy and you didn&#39;t want to lose contact with <br/>
him. I don&#39;t know how big the store is but maybe it was a place where you <br/>
could have done like a &quot;Marco Polo&quot; sort of thing as you walked down <br/>
separate aisles so you could keep audible track of each other (I&#39;m only <br/>
picturing 2 aisles close by each other so maybe this wasn&#39;t possible). If it <br/>
wasn&#39;t possible, maybe I would have simply said &quot;it&#39;s very important to me <br/>
that you are safe and in this big busy store, and separating from you just <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be safe so I&#39;ll stay near you&quot;. If he darted away like he did, I <br/>
would have run after him or at least walked quickly behind him because he <br/>
may want to run but it&#39;s my responsibility to keep his environment safe for <br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;How would the unschooling parent handle this?  I picked him up,<br/>
&gt;leaving the soccer ball behind and we left the store.  When we got<br/>
&gt;home I put him in his room and when I had calmed down,  I asked him<br/>
&gt;to tell me what he had done wrong and why it was wrong. He told me<br/>
&gt;running away and hiding and he knew that it scared me and that he<br/>

&gt;off alone in a store. I also told him that he would have to just use<br/>
&gt;his old soccer ball for soccer this year.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In this case, you&#39;re using punishment which I don&#39;t think works. It also <br/>
seems a bit excessive (no new ball for a YEAR? that&#39;s a lifetime for a <br/>
child). I would have still gotten the ball because it&#39;s what you went there <br/>
for. Not getting it is kind of wiping away all the good memory of the fun <br/>
trip to the store (in my opinion). I also would not have &quot;put him in his <br/>
room&quot; because maybe he was still a bit scared after being separated from you <br/>
and found by a store employee. Maybe he is the type of kid who needed to be <br/>
with you to feel better once you were home. Finally, I think that asking him <br/>
&quot;what he had done wrong and why it was wrong&quot; is just making him feel even <br/>
worse about the whole situation. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a problem to explain how <br/>
worried you were when you were separated and maybe talk about ways that you <br/>
can be sure to stick together in the future but having him rehash the &quot;bad&quot; <br/>
stuff he did isn&#39;t going to make him feel better or help him learn from this <br/>
experience. I think it does do a lot to help him remember what a horrible <br/>
time he had going to the store today.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think from his point of view you were wrong. You&#39;re saying it won&#39;t  <br/>
be safe and yet he was away from you for a good piece of time and was  <br/>
perfectly fine.<br/>
<br/>
I once saw a mother and child in a paint your own pottery place and  <br/>
the mom kept patiently saying, &quot;Don&#39;t touch, they&#39;ll break.&quot; And the  <br/>
child kept touching them gently, clearly saying with his actions  <br/>
&quot;Mom, you&#39;re wrong. Look, I&#39;m touching and they aren&#39;t breaking.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think rather than focusing on the fear of what might happen, it&#39;s  <br/>
better to focus on the strategies and tools for safety. Help  him to  <br/>
be more powerful rather than less.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I also told him that he would have to just use<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Apologize. Tell him you were scared. If you help him with some  <br/>
strategies when he gets lost help him realize that you&#39;ll have to  <br/>
find new &quot;landmarks&quot; in each store since they&#39;re set up differently.  <br/>
(Undoubtedly something he knows but hasn&#39;t thought about in practical  <br/>
terms.) And go back -- when the store isn&#39;t so busy so you&#39;ll be less  <br/>
afraid -- and get the soccer ball. :-)<br/>

<br/>
Joyce, I really like your suggestion to involve him in the problem solving.<br/>
Talk about what could possibly happen (what is mom&#39;s biggest fear?), and<br/>
work out a plan.  I, personally, find it helpful to go all out (in my own<br/>
head) and imagine the absolute worst thing that can possibly happen, and<br/>
then work out a plan in response.  I&#39;m sure that most major stores have the<br/>
capacity to completely shut down on a moment&#39;s notice if a child gets lost.<br/>
I know parents who have done this when their little one snuck off.  It was<br/>
really embarrassing for the parent (the whole &quot;can&#39;t you control your kid in<br/>
public&quot; issue), but the bottom line was, the child was actually safe, even<br/>
when away from the parent.  Also, I don&#39;t think we can underestimate the<br/>
importance of teaching our children which adults they can/should approach in<br/>
the event they get lost or into trouble in a public place.  For a while I<br/>
played the &quot;does he/she work here?&quot; game with my oldest, so now he knows who<br/>
to flag down when he needs some help (usually just to find a particular<br/>
toy!).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2107244762">There is a Sesame Street video which is a short primer on this. Big <br/>
Bird gets separated from Maria in a big store. It covers looking for <br/>
someone who works there and what to say. Also has a song for <br/>
memorizing your phone number. Also talks about picking out a meet-up <br/>
place for if you get split up.<br/>
<br/>
Making sure your kids know your &quot;real&quot; name is a good idea. When we <br/>
were camping, we came upon a lost little girl. All she new (or could <br/>
say at the time) was that her dad&#39;s name was &quot;Daddy&quot;. She was 5.<br/>
<br/>
The book &quot;Protecting the Gift&quot; also recommends telling your children <br/>
that if they get lost they should seek out a woman, preferably a <br/>
woman with children to help them. The whole &quot;find a police oficer to <br/>
help you deal&quot; is soooo unlikely.<br/>
