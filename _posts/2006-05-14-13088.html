<div id="ygrps-yiv-534794328">&quot;I think the question should not be &quot;should that person stay on this<br/>
list?&quot; but &quot;should that person be posting advice to this list?&quot;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a really great way to put it.<br/>
Giving advice that goes against the purpose of the list, will result<br/>
in some pretty intense discussion. If you don&#39;t enjoy that, then<br/>
reading more might help you get more out of the list, rather than posting.<br/>
<br/>
Just remember, most of us that truly, deeply understand and live the<br/>
unschooling philosophies were at a different place in the journey<br/>
years ago. I had some doozy&#39;s I posted and got blasted for!:)<br/>
But we slowly shed layers of &quot;have to&#39;s&quot; and quit limiting our<br/>
children. What we found was a more peaceful family life, better<br/>
relationships and a happier home. <br/>
<br/>
I already KNOW all about limits and what it&#39;s like to employ them. Really.<br/>
What some of you don&#39;t know yet, is about living without that crap and<br/>
how wonderful it can be on the other side.:)  Come on in, the water&#39;s<br/>
fine..........<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1840584028">Yesterday I got a copy of Joyful Parenting which I thought was an unschool<br/>
recommendation however, one chapter I perused mentions &quot;setting limits is a<br/>
loving act.&quot;  Did I buy the wrong book?<br/>
