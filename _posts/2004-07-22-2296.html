I have been coming across the idea that children <br/>

the best way to foster reading is to READ TO THEM (Unschooling <br/>

we begin the journey, by going to the library, modeling a love of <br/>
books and taking time during the day to read together.  <br/>
Oh, I whole-heartedly agree with you on this.  I think the reason Emma (5) is <br/>
learning how to read on her own is because she&#39;s developed a natural love of <br/>
books...by being read to whenever she wants (and that&#39;s a lot)! :)  We are <br/>
regulars at our local library, with Em bringing home about 20-30 books each week! <br/>
 She&#39;s extremely excited about being able to finally get her OWN library card <br/>
this year!  ~~ Denise<br/>

Have you asked her what that means to her?  She may have a completely  <br/>
different idea than you of how to go about that.<br/>
 <br/>
Stay casual about it!<br/>
 <br/>
Sometimes an offer to buy one of those cheapo walmart books and sit with  her <br/>
for a couple of &quot;lessons&quot; addresses her immediate need.  Chances are  they <br/>
will bore the stew out of her and she&#39;ll move on to more exciting  things.  Or <br/>
buy a new CD-Rom.<br/>
 <br/>
Many people have recommended the book Games for Reading.<br/>

See if there are any computer games involving reading she likes e.t.c or get her books from the library about things she is interested in.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-356704104">My daughter, Sierra, is 6, almost 7 and has also been asking to go to school<br/>
like all her friends.  When I pointed out that most of her friends werent<br/>
in school, she named the few who were.  Turns out she wanted to ride the bus<br/>
and to learn to read.  Her brother who is 9 ½ has pretty much picked up<br/>
reading on his own and has never been interested in attending school.<br/>
Sierra got to ride the bus to a YMCA day camp this summer, so I think that<br/>
is out of her system for now.  Some of my friends recommended  Reading<br/>
Reflex: the foolproof phono-graphix method for teaching your child to read<br/>
by Carmen McGuinness and Geoffrey McGuinness.  I got it from the library and<br/>
photocopied some pages & we did a few of the lessons.  We maybe sat down 3-4<br/>
times to do school.  She LOVED it.  She made a list of all the words she<br/>
learned & showed everyone.  And has not asked about it since.<br/>

<br/>
I agree that phonics are very overrated.  Learning words phonetically <br/>
isn&#39;t the only way to recognize words.  Phonics doesn&#39;t work AT ALL for <br/>
my visual/spatial thinker.   She has to SEE the word (feel it, touch <br/>
it, write it in sand etc etc), then stores it as a picture in her <br/>
mind.  Once it&#39;s there, it&#39;s PERMANENT.  She often asks me how to spell <br/>
a word and I&#39;ve always told her.  I never said &quot;go look it up&quot; or &quot;try <br/>
to figure it out&quot; because that would only frustrate her.  She has a <br/>
wonderful vocabulary because I&#39;ve always conversed with her about <br/>
things in a way that is natural for me.   I read to her a lot (and she <br/>
hates reading for pleasure, but still enjoys if I read to her <br/>
sometimes, she&#39;ll be 13 next month). I know she CAN read, she just <br/>
doesn&#39;t enjoy it for pleasure like I do (I know, I&#39;ve said this <br/>
before!). <br/>
<br/>
Make sure she has lots of books, read to her, with her, have her read <br/>
to you, you don&#39;t need to &quot;go to school&quot; to learn to read, if she wants <br/>
to read, she will.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-10140288">I just had to chime in on reading.  I&#39;m still a<br/>
&quot;newbie&quot; with unschooling, so this is my experience<br/>
before we found unschooling.  I love reading and I<br/>
couldn&#39;t wait to pass that love on to my children. <br/>
There was some annoying parents that tried to push<br/>
their kids to read at age 3 and I said to myself that<br/>
I didn&#39;t care how old they were when they learned to<br/>
read, as long as they loved to read.  Then school<br/>
happened!  When my oldest wasn&#39;t picking up on how to<br/>
read by 1st grade, I panicked.  She was tested, and<br/>
tested, and tested and found out that she was<br/>
dyslexic.  She got so much help and still was<br/>
&quot;behind&quot;.  And now she hated reading, and didn&#39;t see<br/>
herself as a reader.  :(  The best &quot;help&quot; I have given<br/>
her was to back off.  No more phonics, sounding out,<br/>
corrections and testing!!!  And guess what...she now<br/>
loves reading again!  That&#39;s what I most wanted and<br/>
just lost sight of.  And I realized that not everyone<br/>
is going to love reading like I do and that&#39;s OK!   My<br/>
dh doesn&#39;t read for enjoyment.  But he&#39;s an extremely<br/>
intelligent man &lt;proud wife ;) &gt; and reads for<br/>
information all the time. He reads high tech,<br/>
complicated, scientific stuff, so he&#39;s probably more<br/>
of a &quot;reader&quot; than I am,  it&#39;s just a different kind<br/>
of reading.  And  I&#39;ve noticed my son isn&#39;t into<br/>
stories but loves looking at his reptile or Bioncle<br/>
books, so I&#39;m not going to be disappointed if he&#39;s<br/>
just like his dad ;) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1962305285">&quot;The descriptions had some big, complex words<br/>
that she learned to read, spell, and understand from PS2.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Trevor and Jared learned most of their spelling/reading and language<br/>
skills from playing Dungeons and Dragons, Yu-gi-oh, Pokemon and loads<br/>
and loads of N64, PS2, Xbox and gamecube play. Yes, they&#39;ve got almost<br/>
every game system imaginable, and they&#39;ve learned a ton from all of it!<br/>
<br/>
I remember how much Trevor hated anything word related for a while<br/>
(thanks to your truly being pushy) and after we went to unschooling,<br/>
he pretty much avoided writing of any kind.<br/>
After a few years, and several new interests later, he started using<br/>
writing only for real purposes (gee, ya think?) rather than for<br/>
pleasure.  One day though, he brought me this one page, handwritten<br/>
sheet, describing a scenario that was amazingly well written, well<br/>
thought out and spelled perfectly!<br/>
I thought he&#39;d copied it from a D&D book.<br/>
Nope.  <br/>
He&#39;d made it up to enhance one of his characters...it was a history of<br/>
the character, where he was from and explanations of his past, written<br/>
in a story format.<br/>
Very cool.  I really didn&#39;t get to see much of the evolvement of his<br/>
spelling and writing skills. It just seemed to happen overnight.<br/>
<br/>
He types about 35-30 wpm, without ever having a single typing lesson.<br/>
 His fingers are never in the position I learned in school, but it<br/>
works just fine.<br/>
<br/>
He games with players all over the world on World of Warcraft and<br/>
Halo2 (xbox live) and Kalonline. They write back and forth, form<br/>
guilds, duel each other and constantly, constantly learn.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1291062603">Thank you Ren - you&#39;re absolutely right.  I can&#39;t put my expectations <br/>
on Elizabeth.  If and when she picks up a book it will be her decision <br/>
and I need to stop worrying about it.  <br/>
<br/>
I need to focus on what she is learning and how I can facilitate her <br/>
interests.  Just now she got an avtar for the game &quot;typing terror&quot; on <br/>
neopets.  I&#39;m so excited for her.  I don&#39;t even have that avtar <br/>
yet.... she types better than I do.  <br/>
<br/>
You know Pam we&#39;ve been talking about going to the library and picking <br/>
up a book on tape - need to stop talking about it and do it.  <br/>

Thanks guys for always pulling me back into what is best for my dd.  <br/>

 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can share how my boys learned to read.  My oldest has always had an  <br/>
interest in reading for as long as I can remember.  Seems he was just &quot;born  that <br/>
way&quot;  LOL.  We have always read as a family, still do.  I  don&#39;t think you ever <br/>
&quot;outgrow&quot; the joy of being read to.  So we have always  had lots of books <br/>
around and have always been a reading family.  My oldest  however has loved those <br/>
gaming magazines since he was like 3.  I remember  him following me around all <br/>
day wanting me to read the magazines to him, and I  would, over and over and <br/>
over and over.  He LOVED them.  And I don&#39;t  think I was quite fast enough for <br/>
him.  He just had to be able to read them  for himself.  Skip parts he didn&#39;t <br/>
want to read, back up and read  paragraphs again etc.  He would ask me how to <br/>
spell words, he would copy  words on paper, he would ask me to read words for <br/>
him, he learned how to sound  out more difficult words.  And he learned to <br/>
read by the age of about  4.  He knew he just HAD TO READ FOR HIMSELF.  <br/>
 <br/>
My youngest was different.  He also loved being read to and lived in  the <br/>
very same environment.  But was very content for me to read to  him.  He did not <br/>
have that same &quot;NEED&quot; to read everything himself.   Several years ago he went <br/>
through a period of wanting me to spell words for him  and he would write them <br/>
down on paper.  But then that stopped.  He  called himself a nonreader for a <br/>
while.  Although we have a great circle of  unschooling friends we hang around <br/>
so for him there was no &quot;negative&quot; attachment  to that (I think in society as <br/>
a whole the majority would look at being a  nonreader at 9 as a negative <br/>
thing).  Our circle of friends were/are so  diverse in the age they started <br/>
reading that it wasn&#39;t any deal at all, big or  small.  LOL.  But inside his head he <br/>
was absorbing things, it wasn&#39;t  as &quot;out there&quot; as my older son.  Then one <br/>
day this past year (he is 10 now)  he just started reading these difficult <br/>
words.  It seems to me that he went  from reading &quot;no&quot;, &quot;mom&quot;, &quot;dad&quot; to reading <br/>
EVERYTHING, in a day.  Although  I am sure there was a process going on inside <br/>
him, it just wasn&#39;t out there for  me to see like with my older son.  So now in <br/>
what seems like a year he can  read generally anything.  It is so amazing.  <br/>
 <br/>
So I have one that started reading around 4 and one that started around  10.  <br/>
Very different processes for each of them.  Both in their own  time, but <br/>
neither in a vacuum.  I just trusted that it would happen.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-198681029"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; I apologize if this question has been asked already. How do<br/>
&gt; children actually learn to read<br/>
&gt; &gt; completely by themselves.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Kids do not learn to read completely by themselves - not at all.<br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t need to be taught, though.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Kids learn to read when surrounded by a print-rich environment,  <br/>
people who read to them a lot, and people who read for themselves for  <br/>
real reasons. Kids need people who are sensitive to them and gently  <br/>
support their emerging interest in language, when it appears, by  <br/>
giving them just enough information and often by playing little fun  <br/>
word or sound games.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes kids learn to read at a very young age and sometimes they  <br/>
learn when they are much older - that depends mostly their own brain  <br/>
development patterns. Teaching doesn&#39;t really hurry it along -  <br/>
schools generally try to get all kids reading by 9 years old - they  <br/>
don&#39;t succeed, but they do a lot of damage in the process of trying  <br/>
-- they create lots of learning disabilities and tremendous amounts  <br/>
of antipathy toward reading. And, what most kids learn is that  <br/>
learning is difficult and that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy for  <br/>
many of them.<br/>
<br/>
A few years ago, I wrote something about how my three kids learned to  <br/>
read - it has a lot of very specific ideas for how to support  <br/>
learning to read in ways other than teaching reading lessons. It is  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-549414280">There is no process.  Learning happens inside the head of each <br/>
individual<br/>
learner.   You might think about why you&#39;re so stuck on the idea there <br/>
has to be<br/>
a process.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
If there *were* a process---ANY kind of process---any kind of one thing <br/>
that follows another that works for everyone---or even HALF of <br/>
everyone, don&#39;t you think the schools and all those &quot;educators&quot; out <br/>
there would have FOUND that process and figured it out and labeled it <br/>
and marketed it and used it in each and every classroom----and that <br/>
every single schooled child could read?<br/>
<br/>
They *think* they have. They&#39;re wrong. Whole word doesn&#39;t work for some <br/>
people. Phonics doesn&#39;t work for some people. Hooked on phonics and BOB <br/>
books and that Davis method and Orton-Gillingham---if any of them <br/>
actually worked, if any of them were actually THE process, there would <br/>
be no non-readers in schools. There would be no struggles in schools.<br/>
<br/>
If &quot;they&quot; are right, and there is some &quot;process,&quot; why do we unschooling <br/>
parents have kids that can read without any adherence to a process? How <br/>
can our &quot;success&quot; in NOT teaching reading be explained?<br/>
<br/>
Each person has a different way to &quot;process&quot; the written word. *Your* <br/>
child has his own &quot;process.&quot; And it&#39;s not anything you can predict. I <br/>
can tell you the secret to reading though. SHSHSHSHSHSHHHHH....<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s having lots of printed materials around. It&#39;s YOU, reading---both <br/>
aloud and to yourself. It&#39;s writing down his stories before he&#39;s able <br/>
to. It&#39;s telling him what something says over and over and over. It&#39;s <br/>
spelling things for him again and again and again. It&#39;s playing word <br/>
games and rhyming and talking about stupid spellings and why they are <br/>
spelled so strangely.<br/>
<br/>
And the BIG secret? PATIENCE. A child who is surrounded by the written <br/>
word and who sees his loved ones reading and enjoying printed materials <br/>
will *naturally* read when he&#39;s physically and mentally ready. It may <br/>
be at four. It may be at 14. But it doesn&#39;t matter *when* a person <br/>
learns to read. He&#39;ll do it when he&#39;s ready IF he&#39;s supported and <br/>
allowed to proceed at his own pace.<br/>

Learning how to read is a process, just like learning unschooling is a<br/>
process.  Each child will go about it in his own way and come to understand<br/>
it in his own way, just like each of us will come to understand unschooling<br/>
on our own terms.<br/>
<br/>
But there IS a process.  Before children can learn to read, they need to<br/>
understand print knowledge (directionality, word-picture match, one-to-one<br/>
correspondance, etc.), phonics, decoding strategies, and comprehension.<br/>
Schools just teach these things, because they have to teach a bunch of kids<br/>
in an environment that is not real life.  Many schools think they have the<br/>
process nailed (children should learn phonics first or children should learn<br/>
whole word recognitions first, etc.).  But the problem is that, while that<br/>
may work for some children, it also doesn&#39;t work for a lot of children.<br/>

Learning how to read is a process, just like learning unschooling is a<br/>
process. Each child will go about it in his own way and come to understand<br/>
it in his own way, just like each of us will come to understand unschooling<br/>

correspondance, etc.), phonics, decoding strategies, and comprehension.<br/>
Schools just teach these things, because they have to teach a bunch of kids<br/>
in an environment that is not real life. Many schools think they have the<br/>
process nailed (children should learn phonics first or children should learn<br/>
whole word recognitions first, etc.). But the problem is that, while that<br/>
may work for some children, it also doesn&#39;t work for a lot of children.<br/>

All we need is our natural instincts to help them reach what they&#39;re  <br/>

Same with reading. All you&#39;ve listed are bits and pieces that are  <br/>
natural to reading. We don&#39;t need to break the process down for us or  <br/>
for the kids in order to help them. As with all natural learning,  <br/>
kids absorb what they need from the chaos in the moment and figure it  <br/>
out. Sometimes they&#39;ll ask questions to clarify some part. That&#39;s  <br/>
part of the process.<br/>
<br/>
In fact it&#39;s rewarding to pull order from chaos. It&#39;s way more  <br/>
empowering *and* interesting than some person trying to hand out the  <br/>
information in the order the person thinks it needs learned in.<br/>
<br/>
Real learning is stumbling across an intriguing a puzzle you want to  <br/>
solve with the whole world as a resource to get help from.<br/>
<br/>
School &quot;learning&quot; is someone telling you which puzzle is important  <br/>
then handing you the answer and telling you to memorize it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-698140235">Dears,<br/>
may I add another view. Rickie, the boyfriend of my youngest daughter is colour blind. When he was in grade one the teacher told the children to paint pictures using certain colours. Green for the leaves and brown for the trunk of trees and that kind of things. Ricki deciphered the information (name of colour) on the crayons in order to &#39;get the right colour&#39; that the teacher wanted to be put on the paper. HOW he actually learned the letters/words that he has not told us yet. &lt;grin&gt;<br/>
He told the teacher about the colour blindness when he was in grade 5 and she never got it.<br/>
<br/>
As I am sitting here I&#39;ve asked my husband (over 50) and my youngest son (15) how each learned to read. Both said that they started by getting to know the letters of the alphabeth. Then came the combination to get syllabes and then whole words and their meaning. Reading silently, reading out loud and writing on computer or handwriting were different roads to travel.<br/>
<br/>
Whom do we trust about this most? Our own references or &#39;educators&#39;?<br/>
<br/>
I think this was one hell of an interesting thread so far.<br/>

My experience is similar to yours.  I am new to this unschooling experience, so I hope you all won&#39;t mind my two cents worth.  My two oldest, now 26 and 22, entered school reading and writing their letters and numbers.  They did not attend pre-school.  I just gave them the tools (crayons, pencils and books) and they were able to learn.  We just read a lot.   <br/>

One of my nephews learned to read by &#39;getting&#39; the names of street signs. And his first &#39;book&#39; was an encyclopedia, which he read from a to z. Well, he won most of the local weekly radio competions at an early age.<br/>

*so* much more interested in hearing how unschoolers &quot;learn&quot; to read<br/>
By reading and being read to and being surrounded by the printed word<br/>
(it&#39;s nearly impossible to avoid words in our society these days even if<br/>
ALL you ever do is watch TV). How do -you- learn something new? For<br/>
instance, if you see a friend making an awesome pan of lasagna right<br/>
down to making the whole wheat noodles, and you think &quot;gee I&#39;d like to<br/>
be able to do that&quot; What do you do? Do you go find a lasagna making<br/>
class and make sure you&#39;re between the ages of 20-22 (the proper<br/>
learning to make lasagna age)? Probably not. You might pull out a<br/>
cookbook and by trial and error (hopefully some of it edible) come up<br/>
with your own process and off you go. You might ask your friend to show<br/>
it to you, explain it to you, hang out next to you while you try your<br/>
first go at it. Odds are neither the cookbook nor your friend will quiz<br/>
you about proper technique, protein ratios, etc. Rather, your friend<br/>
might notice that the dough looks a little dry from her experience and<br/>
suggest adding a little more water to the dough before rolling it out.<br/>
Same thing with unschooled kids learning to read - they may ask<br/>
questions, they may work it on their own, probably a bit of both, and<br/>
our job is to be alongside as much or as little as they choose to assist<br/>
in whatever way they choose. I could tell you about when DS learned to<br/>
read but it&#39;d just be my perspective on what was happening, it wouldn&#39;t<br/>
actually be 100% accurate as to what was going on inside him - just as I<br/>
could tell you what he had for dinner last night but I couldn&#39;t 100%<br/>
accurately tell you how it digested once he ate it.<br/>
<br/>
So, how did DS learn (he was right around 5 when he reached a level of<br/>
comfort and fluency that would be called &#39;reading&#39;, he&#39;s almost 10 now)?<br/>
We had magnets and books and closed captioning and road signs and<br/>
grocery lists and all that various stuff that most families with kids<br/>
have around. We&#39;d read to him as he chose (and sometimes he was busy<br/>
playing with something while we read, he was not required to sit still<br/>
and look at the pages). We read on our own (both DH and I are<br/>
bibliophiles bigtime). I near about sprained my tongue pronouncing<br/>
&quot;mrwtqzgjkln&quot; when he assembled fridge magnet letters and said &quot;Mommy,<br/>
what does that say?&quot; - we also had a discussion about how some vowels<br/>
(aeiou) are helpful for Mommy to not sprain her tongue because the<br/>
English language needs vowels (of course, then I had &quot;uioeoia&quot; to try to<br/>
wrap my poor tongue around lol). Over time, he learned to recognize some<br/>
words and figure out others based on their similarity to other words he<br/>
already knew. That was pretty much it. I knew for certain he was<br/>
&quot;reading&quot; when he popped his head in one day when DH and I were in<br/>
another room and said &quot;there&#39;s a severe thunderstorm watch until 10 pm&quot;<br/>
- he had read the scroll feed across the bottom of the TV screen. That&#39;s<br/>
the best I can do to &#39;explain&#39; how he learned to read - he learned to<br/>
read by reading.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1066103691">Dear Ren<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for bringing it all into perspective again.<br/>
<br/>
You wrote:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;They don&#39;t need to know anything about what you printed. They need to<br/>
be trusted. Reading isn&#39;t really this big magical thing people make it<br/>
out to be. Your child learned to speak an entire language without<br/>
knowing &quot;processes&quot;, why wouldn&#39;t they learn other things the same way?<br/>
<br/>
Helping people understand what learning looks like in unschooling<br/>
homes is more helpful than posting all about what kids &quot;need&quot; to<br/>
understand in order to learn certain things.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I think teaching is harmful in<br/>
general because it places the power outside the individual. What it<br/>
really teaches them is that they NEED to be taught in order to learn!<br/>
It&#39;s harmful and demoralizing and schools are feeding that harm every day.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers are living as if school and it&#39;s &quot;processes&quot; didn&#39;t exist.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t it that every single one of our children is a &#39;special needs&#39; learner <br/>
and it is up to us parents to provide the best environment for each child to <br/>
learn according to their individual needs at the time when they &#39;need&#39; it. <br/>
That is how I understand unschooling in my own home. Just this evening Alex <br/>
had the &#39;need&#39; to learn about astrology in order to understand something <br/>
about himself and his friends better. He was reading a German and an English <br/>
book at the same time. My &#39;teaching&#39; part was to provide quick translations <br/>
between the two languages of  sun signs and planet names when asked. He <br/>
could have looked these up in the dictionary, of course. :)  In the <br/>
&#39;schooling&#39; mindset I would have told him to get the dictionary. In the <br/>
unschooling mindset of course I provided the answers in the same way as I <br/>
would provide it to any other person asking the question. And if he would <br/>
have asked me to read it to him I might have done that, too.<br/>
I have a mother who gives information unasked. It is extremely irritating. <br/>
:) And I catch myself so often when I want to do the same thing. Sometimes I <br/>
can keep my blabbermouth shut. &lt;grin&gt; Sometimes I don&#39;t and the backlash is <br/>
painful.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t remember where I read it but there was a reference to the need for <br/>
food and the need for sleep and the need for skill or knowledge. Eat when <br/>
you are hungry, sleep when you are tired and learn when you want to know. <br/>
Unschooling allows us (and our children) to follow our natural needs or <br/>
urges in these and all other areas.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-627375217">~~But there IS a process.  Before children can learn to read, they<br/>
need to understand print knowledge (directionality, word-picture<br/>
match, one-to-one correspondance, etc.), phonics, decoding strategies,<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re really convinced of this, I can see.<br/>
I&#39;m not.<br/>
<br/>
Even IF these &quot;processes&quot; needed to be in place before one can read,<br/>
one would most certainly not need the above names for them NOR the<br/>
awareness that they knew it.<br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t believe the above need to exist in the learner in order to<br/>
read. My Jared NEVER learned any kind of phonics. In fact, the few<br/>
times he asked about letter sounds it just confused the heck out of<br/>
him. Learning whole words seems to be the way he learned best (no big<br/>
surprise since he memorized hundreds of symbols in pokemon and other<br/>
games).<br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t need to know anything about what you printed. They need to<br/>
be trusted. Reading isn&#39;t really this big magical thing people make it<br/>
out to be. Your child learned to speak an entire language without<br/>
knowing &quot;processes&quot;, why wouldn&#39;t they learn other things the same way?<br/>
<br/>
Helping people understand what learning looks like in unschooling<br/>
homes is more helpful than posting all about what kids &quot;need&quot; to<br/>
understand in order to learn certain things.<br/>
<br/>
I totally disagree with the concept that school isn&#39;t all bad and they<br/>
simply fail to meet individual needs. I think teaching is harmful in<br/>
general because it places the power outside the individual. What it<br/>
really teaches them is that they NEED to be taught in order to learn!<br/>
It&#39;s harmful and demoralizing and schools are feeding that harm every day.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers are living as if school and it&#39;s &quot;processes&quot; didn&#39;t exist.<br/>

I have had a year of unschooling my 5, 8 and 13 year old.  I was home-schooling before that.  I did introduce the alphabet to my 8 year old last year.  I did it &quot;the waldorf way&quot;, which is drawing pictures and telling a story for each letter.  Like a long wonderful story about a Mountain, and all the marvelous magicians that gathered there each Hallow&#39;s Eve.  I drew the picture so that the mountain looked like an M--sort of.  I left it at that.  I did not bring awareness to my hidden M, but just drew the picture while I told the stories with lots of M words mixed in (15 minutes or so).  The next day, I finally drew attention to the M, and he loved every letter like this.  After the letters were introduced, he wanted to &quot;learn to read&quot;.  So, I bought &quot;Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons.&quot;  He chose it.  He loved it and did 88 lessons this year and then declared &quot;I do not EVER want to do another lesson.  I do not need nor want you to &quot;teach&quot; me anything more.  I do not EVER want to do anything that is like School again, and I know how to read.&quot;  WOW.  I had thought he had enjoyed himself, as he was happy during and after these 15 minute &quot;lessons&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
So, guess what?  I have not done another thing.  That was 3 months ago, and he reads everything he sees....he tries.  The book gave him the basic sounds, not really phonics, but more base sounds and allowed a lot of reading to occur with the new found sounds.  The stories were funny, not dumb.  Anyway, I watch closed caption TV at night when I go to bed, and since we all share the same bedroom for sleeping (this is an ebb and flow in itself!), he reads as much as he can from that, and only gets a few words before they disappear and are replaced with others.  He seems to be doing very well!  He is motivated to read those words, as he loves TV at night---like I might be watching Numbers, or the News (edited to not have the gore--I change the channel) and he loves to feel more grown up and read all about it.<br/>
<br/>
He reads and spells so he can search for Star Wars toys on the Internet and I read to him, he listens to Stories on CD a lot as well.  He has no interest in sitting down &quot;to read&quot; nor writing anything at all.  I cringe, I am not used to letting things BE.  I am trying to allow, to adjust, to BE myself so that they can BE themselves.  I do see though, that he is persisting ALL ON HIS OWN.  Just like when he learned to talk.  It is really exactly the SAME process.  And the 5 year old is following behind.  Asking all the time...&quot;how do you spell GIVE BACK?&quot; for instance.  I tell him, I sound out the letters a bit......some he guesses, we refer to all letters at pictures, like A is teepee, E is a diving board for all 3 brothers, M, mountain, N-nightcrawler, B-big belly B, D-Door etc.  It makes it fun, not schoolish work.<br/>

<br/>
I haven&#39;t read the responses to this question yet, but just wanted to <br/>
share that I&#39;m not really sure how my 6yo learned to read.  I sort of <br/>
found out he could read by accident.  I will tell you that he asked a <br/>
lot of questions, &quot;What does this say?!!&quot; and I would answer him and <br/>
read what he wanted me to read (mostly stuff on his video games).  I was <br/>
really frustrated with him one day because he got a new game and I <br/>
downloaded a walkthru for him and he kept asking me every 2 minutes, <br/>
&quot;What do I do next?&quot;   And finally I said, exasperatedly, &quot;What does <br/>
this say??!!!&quot; and he read the sentence to me. I couldn&#39;t believe it!  I <br/>
was in total shock and awe.  Video game walkthrus are written by <br/>
teenagers and older kids/people, so this wasn&#39;t like he was reading an <br/>
&quot;early reader&quot; book.  These were big and hard words.  He still amazes me <br/>
by what he can read.<br/>
<br/>
So, hope this gives you a little insight into &quot;how&quot; unschoolers learn to <br/>
read.  We basically just read to our kids and answer their questions.  I <br/>
don&#39;t make my kid sound out words, he doesn&#39;t really know how to do that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-943737900">Even IF these &quot;processes&quot; needed to be in place before one can read,<br/>
one would most certainly not need the above names for them NOR the<br/>
awareness that they knew it.<br/>
I really wasn&#39;t saying that we needed the names for the process.  I was<br/>
simply debating the fact that reading (like unschooling or talking or<br/>
learning anything, really) has a process.  Everything we learn has a<br/>
process.<br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t believe the above need to exist in the learner in order to<br/>
read. My Jared NEVER learned any kind of phonics.<br/>
That&#39;s just false.  In order to become a proficient reader, one needs to<br/>
know all of the things I mentioned.  I wasn&#39;t saying that we need to &quot;teach&quot;<br/>
these things, or that we even need to know these things.  Just that they<br/>
exist as part of the process of reading.  If your son reads, then he knows<br/>
phonics.  He doesn&#39;t have to be &quot;taught&quot; phonics or even verbalize phonics<br/>
rules.  But he does know phonics if he reads.  (and if he doesn&#39;t now, he<br/>
will know it at some point.)  English is an alphabetic language, not a<br/>
symbolic one.  In order to read new words, we must know how to sound them<br/>
out.  We do this even as adults.  (Try reading the ingredients on the back<br/>
of your shampoo bottle!)<br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t need to know anything about what you printed. They need to<br/>
be trusted. Reading isn&#39;t really this big magical thing people make it<br/>
out to be. Your child learned to speak an entire language without<br/>
knowing &quot;processes&quot;, why wouldn&#39;t they learn other things the same way?<br/>
I explained above why I believe that they do need to know what I printed in<br/>
order to read.  However, I agree with you about the rest.  Just because<br/>
there is a process, doesn&#39;t mean that we need to know it.  My son will tell<br/>
you that he learned to read on his own, because I didn&#39;t push or name this<br/>
process.  (Though I can&#39;t help knowing what I already know.)  I really do<br/>
believe that if you trust children to learn on their own, they will learn.<br/>
Just like when they learned to talk.  There is so much pressure on schools<br/>
to &quot;teach&quot; reading, that I think that pressure is put on parents as well.<br/>
No one pressures us to &quot;teach&quot; our children to talk, so we don&#39;t push it.<br/>
But when people think of learning to read, they get nervous if their child<br/>
doesn&#39;t know how to do it yet.<br/>
<br/>
Helping people understand what learning looks like in unschooling<br/>
homes is more helpful than posting all about what kids &quot;need&quot; to<br/>
understand in order to learn certain things.<br/>
My point wasn&#39;t what children &quot;need&quot; to know, it was that there is a process<br/>
to reading.  Isn&#39;t that helpful to know that reading is a process?  Children<br/>
don&#39;t just read or not read.  It is a process.  Just like I don&#39;t fully<br/>
grasp unschooling all the way.  I&#39;m in the middle of the process of learning<br/>
how to implement unschooling into my life.  When I first understood that it<br/>
is a PROCESS (unschooling), I felt so much better about not knowing<br/>
everything there is to know about unschooling.  I realized that it will come<br/>
eventually, in its own natural path.<br/>
<br/>
I figured it would be helpful if people, who are worried about their<br/>
children&#39;s reading journey, understood that reading is a process.  Maybe<br/>
their child is in the middle of that process right now, and if they<br/>
recognize that, they can relax a little.  (I understand the point of<br/>
unschooling is to NOT worry about what your child is learning in the first<br/>
place, but in reality, we do worry when our child isn&#39;t reading--especially<br/>
those of us just beginning this journey.)<br/>
<br/>
I totally disagree with the concept that school isn&#39;t all bad and they<br/>
simply fail to meet individual needs. I think teaching is harmful in<br/>
general because it places the power outside the individual. What it<br/>
really teaches them is that they NEED to be taught in order to learn!<br/>
It&#39;s harmful and demoralizing and schools are feeding that harm every day.<br/>
I agree.  That&#39;s why I don&#39;t send my children to school.  But many people<br/>
do--some of them feel like they have no choice but to send their children to<br/>
school.  And I really don&#39;t believe that teachers and school authorities are<br/>
bad in nature.  If someone gave me a classroom full of kids and told me to<br/>
teach them to read, I would probably end up doing what they do in schools.<br/>
It&#39;s not ideal, or even the best senerio.  But if these kids have to go to<br/>
school, that&#39;s how they&#39;ll have to learn.  Some do learn.  And some don&#39;t.<br/>
The teachers there are doing the best that they can, with what they know.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers are living as if school and it&#39;s &quot;processes&quot; didn&#39;t exist.<br/>
But schools (and their processes) DO exist.  Many people on this list are<br/>
here because they love the idea of unschooling, but are very aware that they<br/>
are going against mainstream society&#39;s beliefs about education.  They<br/>
believe that unschooling is the right thing to do, but have questions<br/>
regarding what they&#39;ve been &quot;taught&quot; about education and learning, etc.  I<br/>
think it is very important to have discussions about unschooling vs. school<br/>
and the difference in their philosophies about learning.  I assumed that<br/>
this list was the forum to do that.  If not, I sincerely apologize and I<br/>
will find a more appropriate place to do that.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t trying to start a fight here, I am trying to understand unschooling<br/>
in a way that is meaningful to me (and hopefully others out there).   Being<br/>
a former teacher, education and learning is what I know (or thought I<br/>
knew!).  That is the place I am coming from as I start my journey to<br/>
unschool.  WHile I generally agree with the unschooling philosophy, there<br/>
are obviously some points that go against what I believe to be true.  I<br/>
fully understand that when I post some of the things that I&#39;ve posted here,<br/>
I will get an opposing viewpoint.  That&#39;s why I do it.  I need to hear that<br/>
viewpoint, so that I can choose for myself if I want to keep or change my<br/>
viewpoint.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if I offended...<br/>
