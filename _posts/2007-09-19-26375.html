who respect all world religions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1637981489">Cara - we started our own local unschooling support group and listed the<br/>
description in homeschooling calendar/newsletter and on regional yahoo<br/>
groups as: <br/>
<br/>
All unschooling families are invited to meet, talk and play with other<br/>
families *committed* to the unschooling philosophy.  We meet at playground<br/>
and picnic tables behind the Bear Mtn Inn (near row boats).  Discussion<br/>
group starts promptly at 12:00 pm noon.  Stay for afternoon play and<br/>
continued informal discussions - all unschoolers welcome. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The fact that those of us who regularly attend with older kids are radical<br/>
unschoolers definitely sets a tone.  We do host a formal discussion for the<br/>
first hour and half where if ever the topic of limits, (food, tv, video<br/>
games, bed times), forced curriculum, chores etc are on the table newbies<br/>
get the full flavor of a real unschooled life rather quickly.  And more<br/>
often than not those that are early in their unschooling journey become<br/>
enlightened and stick around.  When we started we clearly defined the needs<br/>
of the group as a support group and not an educational venue for folks not<br/>
sure, exploring or simply curious.  We plan to host some kind of<br/>
introduction event to unschoolers for those that are on the fence or<br/>
curious.  But the group&#39;s integrity as one that supports each other in our<br/>
unschooling path is important to the founders and we&#39;ve managed to maintain<br/>
that flavor.  There are folks in the area who choose not to come because we<br/>
don&#39;t fit their idea of an unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We also have a yahoo group for this meeting.  The only way to join this is<br/>
by invitation only and by FIRST attending the physical irl meeting.   While<br/>
it does promote a certain amount of exclusivity it also has really allowed<br/>
for local young unschooling families to follow the path without hearing what<br/>
they can already hear on regular homeschooling lists.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
After 3 and half years, we&#39;ve got over 40 families participating and<br/>
continue to grow each month.  At any one time a meeting can be as few as 3<br/>
to 5 families and we&#39;ve been as many as 15  - 20 families attending.  It&#39;s a<br/>
pretty dynamic group.  But it takes the commitment of just a few of us to<br/>
keep it going.   <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
In New York there was an unschooling state wide yahoo group (Families<br/>
Unschooling In New York - FUNNY) that was started and then there quickly<br/>
became a need to start a second unschooling state wide group - the second<br/>
one is called Radical Unschooling in New York (Runny).  Today RUNNY is the<br/>
more active list of the two.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So I would say - start you own group and call it RADICAL unschooling.   If<br/>
you build it they will come. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

Start your own group with a *very* unschooly description. Don&#39;t hold <br/>
back! Say there will be zero tolerance of the &quot;c&quot;-word (curriculum). &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Make sure you define yourselves as *secular* and...ummm...Holties. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Lots of folks in Ohio. I know the Contis are there, but I don&#39;t know <br/>
where---nor do I know the geography of Ohio.<br/>
<br/>
Does *anyone* live in western PA? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Elissa is in WVA, and there&#39;s a big group in MD---even western MD. <br/>
Didn&#39;t Danielle just start a new group there recently?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hey,<br/>
  Kimberly Conti here. I&#39;m in north central Ohio. We have an <br/>
unschooling yahoo group. Unschoolers from all over the state are in <br/>
it. Maybe some out of state to?? We have over 120 memebers. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
As Kelly said, if your not finding what your looking for you can start <br/>
a yahoo group for unschoolers in your area and believe me they will <br/>
find you!! That&#39;s what I did after my first L&L because I wanted to <br/>
live like that all year long and surround myself with like minded <br/>
families. One of our very energetic members (Carol Reinhard) has been <br/>
working hard for major get togethers throughout the year. We had a <br/>
camp gathering this August. (very fun time!!!) The next one she&#39;s <br/>
planned will be in January here&#39;s the link<br/>

<br/>
Okay enough about Ohio. Hope to see some new faces soon!!!<br/>
