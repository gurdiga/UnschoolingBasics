<div id="ygrps-yiv-844805243">Hello in cyberland!  Gosh its been so long since Ive posted here.  I have<br/>

In August we are going on a family trip.  Well, my parents, my siblings, my<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2023296978">I think the answer might vary with each family, it really depends on how<br/>
their reactions might be.  My in-laws dont know were unschooling, nor<br/>
anyone else on that side of the family, but they do know that Im a relaxed<br/>
type of parent so I doubt the reaction would be much more than Huh, that<br/>
seems like something she would be doing. And then nothing would be said,<br/>
perhaps a few curious questions but nothing judgemental.  However if you<br/>
feel that the reactions would take over the vacation, then giving them a<br/>
heads up might be best.  Especially if you are sharing overnight spaces and<br/>
they will be expecting children to be in bed by a certain hour.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Im glad to hear that your Dh is more onboard with unschooling now, hooray!<br/>
I know he was having a tough time understanding your point of view so thats<br/>
a huge step forward for your family. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-460071976">We go to maine every summer for a little over a week with our extended<br/>
family. G&#39;ma and G&#39;pa as well as aunts/uncles and cousins of various<br/>
ages. We are pretty straight forward about what we do and why. We<br/>
agree to disagree on some topics but I try to find common grround. My<br/>
SIL just gave me some great advice pertaining to our mutual MIL. She<br/>
asks MIL for inut and parenting advice on small inconsquential things<br/>
but never the big stuff she feels strongly about. This gives grammy<br/>
some say or at least consideration. I am going to try this because MIL<br/>
is the one I conflict with. She did not ever allow my husband sugar<br/>
until he was old enough to get it out of the house. And dh wasn&#39;t<br/>
allowed to watch most TV programs and their were veiwing restrcitions<br/>
as well. SO needless to say we differ! I am unapologetic when it comes<br/>
to what we do. I don&#39;t apologize to my relatives if the wasy we parent<br/>
makes them uncomfortable if what we or our children is doing is<br/>
reasonable. For instance, my kids hardly ever wear shoes by my sister<br/>
doesn&#39;t allow hers to be barefooted. This caused a problem for her at<br/>
the playground because she opted for struggle with her 2 y/o. I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t make my 5 y/o put on shoes even though it would have made her<br/>
life eaiser. My kids brought their DS&#39;s and portable video player and<br/>
this made grammy uncomfortable but I didn&#39;t change our families<br/>
freedom to make her comfortable. We have not really had much issue<br/>
even though MIL is a school teacher and thinks we are nuts. She loves<br/>
our kids and thinks they are awesome. I figure I am my kids parent and<br/>
it is my &quot;job&quot; to be what they need me to be.<br/>
<br/>
about the obidience with your sister. I would explain that we do<br/>
things differently. In our family we make request and don&#39;t demand<br/>
obiedience. That is she has issues with your children that you are<br/>
willing to help her talk to them in a respectful way that they are use<br/>
to. I make every effort to be cheerful and helpful (even when I don&#39;t<br/>
feel like it sometimes) around relatives that I have<br/>
issues with. Not in a dishonest but in helping to keep the peace for a<br/>
short period of time. I want our vacations to be fun and joyous for<br/>
all.<br/>
Good luck<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1657262300">I agree with Ren, family and people tend not to absorb information<br/>
until they&#39;re ready for it. That probably means waiting until they ask<br/>
you about it, even if it kills you. I should have kept my hands quiet<br/>
many times because showing says a lot more than telling.<br/>
<br/>
I learned last weekend in the back to back visits with MIL and my<br/>
parents that creating space for the kids is essential - as is being<br/>
their advocate. For example my MIL at one point interfered with a<br/>
situation between me and my son so I said, &quot;We&#39;ll discuss this later.&quot;<br/>
I walked between her and Jael and left the room with him.<br/>
<br/>
For that reason it might not be good to share a room or car with them.<br/>
On trips I need space to be myself and the kids need space to be<br/>
themselves or everyone will be frazzled and exhausted.<br/>
<br/>
Diana had a good point in &quot;Your concern is appreciated, your approval<br/>
not necessary.&quot;  They want the best for your kids too, and for your<br/>
sanity and theirs, it might be good to think over now what your limits<br/>
are and how to work with those limits.  It might mean a separate hotel<br/>
room, separate car, or just informing family a short list of what your<br/>
kids are used to so they won&#39;t be caught off-guard.  Be prepared to<br/>
create space verbally as well.  I need to remember that too - it can<br/>
be scary standing up to our family! But our kids need us to do that<br/>
for them.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps. I am keeping this to remind myself too ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-95049404">Thanks for the advice so far.  Unfortunately we do have to share rooms and<br/>
we are all driving down together. (I dont have a car and it also saves on<br/>
gas for everyone).  This trip is for my b-i-l and my mothers birthday (they<br/>
share the same birthday) so Im not really planning for it, nor am I paying<br/>
for anything.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
For my parents it would help them to  have information beforehand.  They may<br/>
not agree with it, but its better for them to know whats going on.  My<br/>
family tends to be intellectual and they like having information and<br/>
such.  The more expert it seems the better :(<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I will definitely talk to my children beforehand and let them know that if<br/>
there is any issue they can come to me first.  I dont want them to feel<br/>
like they have to do anything just because its family.<br/>

It might be better to simply explain how your family will handle<br/>
things differently, rather than setting them up for failure by saying<br/>
&quot;you don&#39;t have to do what they say&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Just explain how your family might handle different situations and ask<br/>
them to get an arbitrator if they feel they can&#39;t handle it (you).<br/>
I&#39;ve watched this kind of thing happen before, where an RU family sets<br/>
up the entire situation to be &quot;here&#39;s how we do it&quot; and everything was<br/>
total chaos and bad feelings all around.<br/>
<br/>
I still think it best to simply BE peace, BE joy and let people think<br/>
what they will. Let the kids know you&#39;re their advocate without<br/>
telling them &quot;you don&#39;t have to do what they say&quot;. It won&#39;t kill them<br/>
to know other people handle relationships differently and be adaptable<br/>
(as long as nobody is treating them rudely of course).<br/>
<br/>
Heck, my kids would not expect to stay up late in a shared situation<br/>
if it bothered other people. It&#39;s more about adapting to the<br/>
circumstances than trying to have things run a certain way. YOU can be<br/>
respectful to the children and advocate for them anywhere in life,<br/>
whether family is there or not.<br/>

five years later he punches a woman for her wallet and is called a mugger;<br/>
later still, when he slugs a fellow worker who insults him, he is called a<br/>
troublemaker, but when he becomes a father and hits his tiresome,<br/>
disobedient or disrespectful child, we call him a disciplinarian. Why is<br/>
this rung on a ladder of interpersonal violence regarded so differently from<br/>
the rest? ~ Penelope Leach<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Family trips can be really hard if you aren&#39;t prepared.  First, your<br/>
family doesn&#39;t NEED to know the extent of your unschooling if your not<br/>
ready to explain it.  Especially if you think they will not be<br/>
receptive to the philosophies, then there is no point in explaining it.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We take a family trip every year with my in-laws.  *gasp*  As far as<br/>
food goes, I make sure that we have a own stash of food.  If they are<br/>
diving into their own food stash, rather than the community food<br/>
stash, then the likely hood of family members stopping them or saying<br/>
anything goes down significantly.  <br/>
<br/>
As for sleeping, I have found that fun days in the sun put my kids to<br/>
sleep much earlier than normal anyway.  You could discuss sleeping<br/>
arrangements with them ahead of time, I forget how old your children<br/>
are.  Being respectful of other sleepers IS important.  I don&#39;t know<br/>
your accommodations, but trying to find the kids a &quot;cozy spot&quot; or<br/>
place of their own is a good idea.  <br/>
<br/>
As for comments, I always had a way of ignoring them.  Eventually they<br/>
went away.  :-)  If they say something like &quot;Well, I do it this way&quot; <br/>
your answer can simply be &quot;I don&#39;t&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This may or may not be a good idea.  I don&#39;t know your family.  But<br/>
the truth is, every parent parents differently.  There&#39;s a million and<br/>
one categories you could group parenting styles into.  Personally, I<br/>
would just let this be your style, without worrying too much about<br/>
labeling it as unschooling and trying to explain it.  Just go with it<br/>
and be confident in what you are doing.  They don&#39;t HAVE to agree. <br/>
Just like you don&#39;t HAVE to agree with them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d just worry about you.  Work on some confident answers just in<br/>
case.  And just keep doing what your doing.  I guess to outsiders we<br/>
might be classified as &quot;lenient parents&quot;.  Big deal.  Let them think<br/>
your lenient.  :-)</div>

letting the kids &quot;be kids&quot; is good.  Already knowing, and reminding<br/>
them that they can come to you if they need anything I think would be<br/>
better.  My old son who knows he can trust me comes to me with issues<br/>
on vacation.  There has been a few times he hasn&#39;t liked the way he<br/>
was treated.  He forms an opinion on the person or situation, and has<br/>
learned to avoid certain situations.  I suppose he is learning that<br/>
everyone is different.  From our trips he has learned that his aunt<br/>
and uncle are &quot;REALLY mean to their kids&quot;.  Which is really<br/>
unfortunate that a 9 year old had to come to that decision.  However,<br/>
by supporting his needs and was able to be confident and judge the<br/>
situations for themselves.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if that seems a little jumbled.  It&#39;s early!  LOL  Sometimes,<br/>
with family, I think &quot;less is more&quot;.</div>

Thanks for the advice so far.  Unfortunately we do have to share rooms <br/>
and<br/>
we are all driving down together. (I don’t have a car and it also saves <br/>
on<br/>
gas for everyone).  This trip is for my b-i-l and my mother’s birthday <br/>
(they<br/>
share the same birthday) so I’m not really planning for it, nor am I <br/>
paying<br/>
for anything.<br/>
<br/>
--=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Just remember that they don&#39;t have any power over you---not even <br/>
because they are picking up the tab. It was their choice and their <br/>
*gift* to you to pay your way. You don&#39;t owe others for gifts. You can <br/>
be appreciative of their gift, but you don&#39;t have to plat their games <br/>
in repayment.<br/>
<br/>
Your parents *had* their chance to be parents---and they could be <br/>
whatever kind of parents they CHOSE to be. It was a choice. THEIR <br/>
choice. Either they think they did an excellent job with you, so they <br/>
should be at peace with your decisions. OR---they did a lousy job with <br/>
you; and if so, they need to back off while you try better/different <br/>
techniques for a better outcome with *your* children. Either way, *you* <br/>
are in charge.<br/>
<br/>
And you can ask them: did you feel you did a good job (so trust me) or <br/>
a bad job (so let me figure out a better way)? They will *want* to say <br/>
they did a GOOD job! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As for your sister, she has ABSOLUTELY NO SAY IN ANYTHING.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
For my parents it would help them to  have information beforehand.  <br/>
They may<br/>
not agree with it, but it’s better for them to know what’s going on.  My<br/>
family tends to be “intellectual” and they like having “information” and<br/>
such.  The more “expert” it seems the better :(<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well, if they are TRULY intellectuals, they will be open to learn more <br/>
about something that&#39;s new to them, right? *YOU* have been on both <br/>
sides of the fence. *YOU* know the results of their parenting, both as <br/>
a child AND as an adult parent. But they have never witnessed &quot;the <br/>
other side.&quot; If they are *true* life learners, this shouldn&#39;t be a <br/>
stretch. If they refuse to learn anything about it, they aren&#39;t really <br/>
life learners at all, are they? &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I will definitely talk to my children beforehand and let them know that <br/>
if<br/>
there is any issue they can come to me first.  I don’t want them to feel<br/>
like they “have to” do anything just because it’s “family”.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yeah---let them know that *y&#39;all* are partners. And that, if someone <br/>
commands them, they can wait until they talk with you. Not to defiantly <br/>
say, &quot;I don&#39;t have to!&quot; but to quietly say, &quot;I&#39;d like to talk with my <br/>
mom about that first.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If they know you&#39;re trying to change and be a better parent, they will <br/>
work with you. You can all work together.<br/>
<br/>
My boys and I discuss other parents all the time. It helps me to hear <br/>
what they like about my parenting and helps me avoid what they don&#39;t <br/>
like in others. We talk about why a parent acts a certain way (few <br/>
tools, bad modeling, power issues, etc.). They are KEEN observers of <br/>
parenting and family relationships. I KNOW they will be better parents <br/>
than I am. They already have a lot of better life skills than I had at <br/>
their ages! &lt;g&gt; And I think that has a lot to do with asking them to be <br/>
my partners in being a better, more mindful parent.<br/>
<br/>
Let *them* help *you* in this. Be sociologists during the trip. Notice <br/>
(and remark/discuss when alone) how others act towards each <br/>
other---parents, children, siblings, etc. Be observers and compare the <br/>
different behaviors, reactions, and power struggles. Decide what you, <br/>
as a family would like to emulate and what you would like to stomp into <br/>
the ground. A HUGE unit study (&lt;G&gt;) on sociology, psychology, and <br/>
&quot;humane-ities.&quot; &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1551329968">I wanted to second whomever said that you have LOTS of time to help  <br/>
your kids. Whenever we&#39;re going to a family situation, I spend a lot  <br/>
of time talking with my kids about things that have happened in the  <br/>
past, how it was handled (we also talk over those things as soon as  <br/>
we leave the situation), and then we talk about what could possibly  <br/>
happen and how we would like to handle it. I really tend to fall back  <br/>
into old parenting without a LOT of planning of how I&#39;d like to  <br/>
handle things, and it does help the kids prepare and give them time  <br/>
to develop a firm and appropriate manner to defend themselves (as  <br/>
awful as that sounds)  Also, while you are there, be sure to have  <br/>
time when you can just maybe go for a walk, or do something with just  <br/>
YOUR kids, we usually have one-on-one time at my in-laws. Just take  <br/>
one kids for a couple of blocks, so you can say &quot;How&#39;s it going? Any  <br/>
problems?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My biggest problem with reactions from others tends to be my own  <br/>
defensiveness. When you try to defend your parenting, it sends a cue  <br/>
that something is available to attack, that you are insecure about  <br/>
the choices you&#39;ve made. So I like Ren&#39;s suggestions, about just  <br/>
Being, but also, be bright and cheerful as you can about things, and  <br/>
don&#39;t ever mutter a complaint about how hard it is (I made that  <br/>
mistake one time, right after we started homeschooling, four years  <br/>
later my mother STILL uses it as ammo when things look tough)<br/>
<br/>
If you can, work it into conversations one-on-one with your family  <br/>
before going, like talking to your mother and saying &quot;You know, I&#39;m  <br/>
thinking because we don&#39;t see you often, the kids will not have a  <br/>
bedtime while we&#39;re there. I&#39;ll just help them to bed when they&#39;re  <br/>
tired.&quot; I dunno, just seems to make sense, instead of one big thing  <br/>
that they are thinking through, just little nuggets. If your sister  <br/>
says something about obedience when you&#39;re talking over the phone,  <br/>
say something like &quot;I know it feels good when they jump right to it,  <br/>
but isn&#39;t it nice to see a generous heart with something done  <br/>
willingly?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Where will you be staying? Because with so many kids, surely you  <br/>
would qualify for a room by yourself! I know when we travel, with  <br/>
nine of us we have to get two rooms (by law, due to numbers)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we&#39;ve never really done a family trip. A day trip to Tulsa  <br/>
with my parents was enough for me, and then two days with my in-laws  <br/>
in Texas, but we had our own bedroom at dh&#39;s grandma&#39;s house so the  <br/>
kids could escape in there. Good luck, I wish you the best on this.  <br/>
Family is nice, but they aren&#39;t the end all, be all, especially when  <br/>
the relationships are damaging.<br/>

&gt; Hello in cyberland! Gosh it�s been so long since I�ve posted here.  <br/>
&gt; I have<br/>
&gt; a question that I�m sure has been asked before, and will benefit  <br/>
&gt; many others<br/>
&gt; by my asking it again:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In August we are going on a family trip. Well, my parents, my  <br/>
&gt; siblings, my<br/>
&gt; children and me (dh is sitting this one out). My family doesn�t  <br/>
&gt; know to the<br/>
&gt; extent which I am Unschooling. This will be the first time that we  <br/>
&gt; will all<br/>
&gt; be sharing days and days together (Thursday � Sunday including  <br/>
&gt; driving to<br/>
&gt; our destination together).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any helpful tips on how to deal with their reactions when my  <br/>
&gt; children are<br/>
&gt; allowed to eat what they want, sleep when they want, etc? My  <br/>
&gt; sister, in<br/>
&gt; particular, is big on �obedience� and being told once to do something.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Honestly part of me does not want to go on this trip, But it is an<br/>
&gt; opportunity to spend time with family, and for the most part it can  <br/>
&gt; be a fun<br/>
&gt; trip. I thought about maybe talking with them about my (and now  <br/>
&gt; dh�s yeah!<br/>
&gt; Long story on that turn around!) parenting philosophies. Maybe I  <br/>
&gt; can send<br/>
&gt; them some good links ahead of time so that they know what to  <br/>
&gt; expect? Any<br/>
&gt; suggestions on which links to send?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I�m asking now because I have a few months to maybe soften them up  <br/>
&gt; and get<br/>
&gt; them ready; and to prepare myself as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Namast�<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1068973531">Yes, I&#39;ve asked the kids to be flexible a bit because our family is  <br/>
stuck, but also to say &quot;My mom says I can do x, y, z.&quot; So that I  <br/>
become the issue, rather than the kids.<br/>
<br/>
Same about bedtimes, at my in-laws house, their kids have to be in  <br/>
bed by 9pm, on the weekends even, but out of consideration, we ask  <br/>
our kids to quiet down and play upstairs in our sleeping area. They  <br/>
usually go to sleep because 1) they are just as tired as anything  <br/>
from playing hard all day and 2) they want to be able to get up early  <br/>
when everyone else does.<br/>
<br/>
Josh usually stays up later, but he gets on the computer and plays  <br/>
all night. There really aren&#39;t very many cousins his age, just one  <br/>
who&#39;s a really big sports guy, and they have nothing in common.<br/>

&gt; It might be better to simply explain how your family will handle<br/>

&gt; &quot;you don&#39;t have to do what they say&quot;.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve watched this kind of thing happen before, where an RU family sets<br/>
&gt; up the entire situation to be &quot;here&#39;s how we do it&quot; and everything was<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-547350575">My strategy when we&#39;re with family who really don&#39;t and won&#39;t &quot;get it&quot; - or<br/>
for whom I&#39;m not willing to make the effort to explain because of past<br/>
experience- is to play up the whole &quot;vacation&quot; aspect of things.  If someone<br/>
questions the kids eating whatever they want, I saw &quot;oh, it&#39;s vacation, they<br/>
can have what they like&quot;.  If one of them gets a bit out of sorts (which is<br/>
interpreted by some family members as &quot;naughty&quot;) I&#39;ll give them comfort<br/>
privately and mention to the family that the &quot;change of schedule&quot; has the<br/>
child feeling a bit off.  This seems to allow them to believe that there&#39;s<br/>
no reason for them to step in and correct our parenting.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Mostly in this situation I see it as protecting my children from family who<br/>
are all too willing to see all children as manipulative and bad.  If I show<br/>
absolutely no signs of being upset by my kids&#39; needs, no one else sees<br/>
things as being any different than what they expect.  And I always, in all<br/>
cases, stand up for them if they&#39;re treated badly or I&#39;ll translate into<br/>
respectful language for family members who aren&#39;t being respectful (ie.<br/>
&quot;your aunt was wondering if you&#39;d be willing to move your activity elsewhere<br/>
because this spot is where everyone needs to walk through&quot; if a relative<br/>
were to say &quot;get your stuff out of the way!&quot; or something worse).<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Confidence, the ability to walk away from a challenge (&quot;sorry, that&#39;s not up<br/>
for discussion&quot; or &quot;thanks for the information, that&#39;s something to think<br/>
about&quot;), and the willingness to simply leave if the family becomes too<br/>
oppressive are pretty useful.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Personally, I wouldn&#39;t &quot;prepare&quot; anyone or try to make them &quot;understand&quot;<br/>
because it just draws more attention and will make your parenting the focus<br/>
of the gathering rather than just being with family.  Sure, if someone seems<br/>
willing to try to understand you can make brief explanations (or give them<br/>
references to further information), but I&#39;ve found that is just as likely to<br/>
be thrown back in your face later.  If you don&#39;t need their approval, you<br/>
don&#39;t need to seek it.  And I&#39;ve found the less I try to help people<br/>
understand, the more respectful they are of my choices and actions when it<br/>
comes to my kids.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-26991244">It seems to me that you are preparing yourself for the worst possible<br/>
scenario.  Is it at all possible that you children will be able to<br/>
entertain themselves better than the &quot;obedient&quot; children?  Is it<br/>
possible that your children have seen how others interact with their<br/>
parents and are perceptive enough to keep from causing a major issue?<br/>
 Is it possible that it won&#39;t even come up?<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re heading into a family reunion in August as well.  My SIL<br/>
home-schools her kids in a very regimented &quot;school-at-home&quot; situation.<br/>
 My niece and nephew are expected to behavior a certain way at all<br/>
times.  Though my children and hers are about the same age, I find<br/>
that my children are more capable of holding adult conversation,<br/>
blending into the social situation, and incorporating all children<br/>
into play.  <br/>
<br/>
We have always home-schooled and have slid steadily toward unschooling<br/>
over the years, but this year is the first time that I would say that<br/>
we have an unschooling lifestyle.  What do I plan to tell everyone at<br/>
the reunion?  NOTHING.  I will be there for a week, in the same house,<br/>
with the kids sharing rooms.  I have no intention of making anything<br/>
out of it.  If anyone asks, I will talk about how I wish for my<br/>
children to have a well-balanced life, a strong sense of self, and a<br/>
love of life-long learning.  <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t stress so much about it.  These are not anyone else&#39;s children.<br/>
 They are yours.  They certainly should have enough respect for the<br/>
situation that they could find a way to keep themselves busy if the<br/>
situation arises that the children are expected to retire to bed.  <br/>
<br/>
Talk to your kids about it.  Don&#39;t bother to talk to anyone else about<br/>
it.  They likely know that you parent differently, the unschooling<br/>
would just make sense if they look at it.  Giving them advance<br/>
information gives them time only to prejudge your kids.  Just leave it<br/>
as it is and relax about it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-328005024">It seems to me that in most cases the thing that causes conflict on<br/>
trips like this is the &quot;obedience&quot; expectation your sister may have in<br/>
that she may expect your children to be obedient to her.   It&#39;s funny<br/>
how so often we are wondering how to make those around us comfortable<br/>
and how to tip toe around their expectations but we don&#39;t expect our<br/>
own comfort.    Think about this....if the situation were to arise<br/>
that your sister was unkind to your child regarding something she was<br/>
expecting obedience about (pick up that toy right now!)  ask yourself<br/>
how she would feel (and also respect her different way of parenting)<br/>
if her child wanted to do something against their rules and you said<br/>
&quot;go ahead it&#39;s ok with me&quot;   it&#39;s the same sort of lack of respect for<br/>
her parenting.   You can even give her that example if she is<br/>
demanding that your child be obedient (sorry if my example isn&#39;t very<br/>
clear!)     I would just casually say &quot;my kids don&#39;t have a bed time<br/>
but we will respect your need for quiet when you chose to go to bed&quot; <br/>
 or &quot;we think of our children as equal humans who have minds and<br/>
dreams of their own we do not give arbitrary rules nor do we expect<br/>
them to be obedient just because the person demanding has lived<br/>
longer&quot; .   I would try hard to be respectful of their ways as well...<br/>
I find most conflict comes when people are expecting others to do it<br/>
their way ... I would draw the line when it came to them &quot;parenting&quot;<br/>
my child but try to remain respectful of their way of parenting (this<br/>
excludes of course abusive behavior!)    Hopefully they will observe<br/>
your peaceful existence with your child and want some of the same for<br/>
their family!!   Good luck!!    <br/>

When a big kid hits a little kid on the playground, we call him a bully;<br/>
five years later he punches a woman for her wallet and is called a mugger;<br/>
later still, when he slugs a fellow worker who insults him, he is called a<br/>
troublemaker, but when he becomes a father and hits his tiresome,<br/>

this rung on a ladder of interpersonal violence regarded so differently from<br/>
the rest? ~ Penelope Leach<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1408910854">-hi, I just wanted to add something to help you not to stress about <br/>
it.  It&#39;s a family trip, therefore, it should be about getting <br/>
together & having fun. Everyone just needs to be respectful of each <br/>
other to avoid conflict or offending one another. If they ask about <br/>
unschooling or your education preferences/style. Just say, you don&#39;t <br/>
want to take up all the vacation days the family have to discuss it <br/>
because it will if you do. Ask them to look up/research Brainrules, <br/>
joyfully rejoicing or sandra dodd or other references you know, for <br/>
them to have some idea or understanding about your way of life/with <br/>
the kids. after them doing that and if they still have any questions, <br/>
you&#39;d be happy to answer them then. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re new to unschooling, my husband is still trying to get it. When <br/>
he gets frustrated, I just ask him as a reminder. &quot;If you have a yr, <br/>
a month, a week or a day to live...how would you spend it with the <br/>
kids?&quot; Happy moments, then both agrees.<br/>

used to not think much of outlet stores. I checked them out last <br/>
time I was there and got some incredible bargains for my kids! A <br/>
great way to stock up on clothes for the next season really cheap.<br/>
