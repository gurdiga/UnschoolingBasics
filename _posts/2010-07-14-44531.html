<div id="ygrps-yiv-268019440">I just joined this group a week ago to find a community for unschooling as I <br/>
plan to unschool my son, who&#39;s just turned three.  I had a couple of thoughts <br/>
about this situation so thought I&#39;d share them.  I have to say that I&#39;ve not <br/>
followed all of the posts due to time restrictions so apologies if anyone <br/>
already said the same thing.  It sounds of course like things have improved but <br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking about you  and your family a lot so thought that although it <br/>
seems like it&#39;s getting better, I&#39;d still pass on my thoughts...<br/>
1.  My husband is always saying how benificial martial arts are for boys and I <br/>
wondered if it would be worth asking your son if something like that interested <br/>
him.  My husband says that it gives them a place to express aggression in a <br/>
controlled environment and learn how to deal with anger in a safe and <br/>
non-personal way.  <br/>
<br/>
2.  Could your son take B vitamins?  I am not a nutritional and so do not know <br/>
if children can even take Bs, but they are stress vitamins and really help with <br/>
any stressful situations and nerves and anxiety.  <br/>
<br/>
3.  My husband and I are working with the most incredible man - Bill Stierle - <br/>
and I wondered if he might be a good person for you and your son to talk to.  He <br/>
teaches parenting as well as being a mediator -- and his philosophy would not go <br/>
against the way it sounds like you are raising your children.  He talks about <br/>
how different people think in different ways and he shows you how to communicate <br/>
more effectively with someone who thinks differently to you (ie your son).  For <br/>
example if you are an emotional person and your son is analytical you each need <br/>
different ways of communication.  He also works with &#39;needs based communication&#39; <br/>
and non-violent  communication.  Obviously I am paraphrasing and it&#39;s relatively <br/>
new to me.  What I do know is how absolutely amazing he is with children and <br/>
working out their needs.  To see him with children is just an eyeopener.  And he <br/>
is not a therapist so it would not be therapy as such, just a way to more <br/>
efficiently communicate and to find out the core of your son&#39;s troubles and <br/>
need.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the group, I&#39;m looking forward to the adventure of unschoolling.  <br/>
Best wishes, Sarah <br/>
