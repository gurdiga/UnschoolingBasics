 </span></blockquote>Ahem.  And, it also happens to adults who want to send a clear <br/>
message to our many resident woodchucks (in a &quot;language&quot; *they* <br/>
understand) not to chew through her garden fence to get at the <br/>
broccoli and zucchini and green beans and other things growing <br/>
there.  I&#39;ve done it before, and I&#39;ll do it again!  (I suppose it <br/>
helps that our backyard is very secluded.)<br/>
<br/>
This season we plan to use a fence that&#39;s less chew-through-able, but <br/>
the point is I really don&#39;t see what the big deal is!<br/>

**Damn. I&#39;m going to have to get those things that make the water turn<br/>
colors if someone pees.<br/>
<br/>
He denies that he has actually peed in the pool. I&#39;m skeptical.  ~Rue<br/>

Hmmmm. I have it in writing:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I pee in the pool, and the shower - but I donâ€™t post it to the world&quot;<br/>

No denying it now! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1402439553">You won&#39;t catch flack from me. I&#39;ve done my fair share of drawer dropping at the lake or on <br/>
hikes. It&#39;s not like you&#39;re at the local playground and flashing three year olds. :-P  although I <br/>
have flashed MY three year old...hm. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s one of those, &quot;Why didn&#39;t you go when we were at the rest stop type of things?&quot;. it just <br/>
happens,<br/>
And it does work for moles...the only place in our backyard that&#39;s free is the spot that the <br/>
boys use when they are too busy defending the universe against aliens to come inside.<br/>
