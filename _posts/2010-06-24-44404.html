If you like to work from writing prompts here are some questions to get you going:<br/>
 <br/>
What are some of your favorite late night adventures?<br/>
Ever had your kids want to do or talk about something late at night? <br/>
Did you transition to &quot;no bedtimes&quot; or did it all flow naturally?<br/>
How and where does everyone sleep? Family bed? Musical beds?<br/>
How do you and your spouse get &quot;quality time&quot; together? <br/>
How do you get your personal needs met when kids are &quot;up all night&quot;? <br/>
When visiting family and friends, do you get questions or unpleasant comments? How do you deal?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1178107250">September&#39;s topic is: &quot;Unschooling Plus!&quot;<br/>
The principles of unschooling pervade our lives, but there&#39;s no such thing as a single &quot;unschooling lifestyle&quot;. How do you meld other aspects of your life, your wider values and passions with the principles of unschooling? <br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
 <br/>

Religious beliefs<br/>
Personal ethics<br/>
Dietary issues<br/>
Health concerns<br/>
Home business, farm, or work-related travel<br/>
Living with adults outside the nuclear family<br/>
Politcal activism<br/>
Longstanding adult hobbies</div>
