<div id="ygrps-yiv-671450624">Hi -<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been learning about unschooling to deal w/ my 15 year old who has left high school.<br/>
<br/>
It excites me, but I&#39;m also really scared to take the leap with my other kids.  <br/>
<br/>
However, my 3rd grader has gone from a happy child who likes school to hating to go for various reasons.<br/>
<br/>
Today he informed me that the music teacher made him write 100 times &quot;I will not forget my flute&quot; or else he would have had to miss recess, because he &quot;forgot&quot; his flute (the first time no less).  Well, actually I pulled his flute out during some backpack shuffling, but even if he did forget (hello?  don&#39;t these teachers ever forget things!), I think that was such a STUPID, MEAN way to handle it.<br/>
I&#39;m so angry and I see the rude treatment of kids at school all the time and it breaks my heart.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I just want to pull him out, this is the straw that is breaking the camel&#39;s back, but on the other hand I feel like it&#39;s kind of crazy.  <br/>
<br/>
Am I crazy?  I&#39;m a super sensitive person, so I think I&#39;m way more tuned in to the injustice at school than most people.  But I feel like I moving away from school more than I&#39;m moving towards unschooling, although I wouldn&#39;t want to do anything else I dont think.<br/>
<br/>
Can I just pull him out and unschool at this point legally?  I know I have to register myself but isn&#39;t it too late?<br/>
<br/>
Thankyou!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2065219384">Go for it! It is *not* that you are being ov erly sensitive--that was incredibly rude and obnoxious of that teacher. Unfortunately, that kind of thing ends up being the rule more than the exception at too many schools. It is not helping your kid learn *anything* positive or useful. Let him stay away from there, and be in an environment that is more conducive to learning things that are of actual value!<br/>
<br/>
Regulations vary from state to state, but I believe it is never too late to start homeschooling--I started one year in mid-May.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1079169213">I pulled my 3rd grader in Feb because she was so unhappy.  She would be<br/>
ticked off very easily and often cry because she was so frustrated.  When<br/>
she began to tell me that she was stupid, my husband and I decided it was<br/>
time to pull her.  Two months later, I have a much, much happier child.<br/>
<br/>
She takes after her momma - I have a Masters in Education - she loves to<br/>
learn.  After I let go of the drill and practice and &quot;You&#39;ve to learn this&quot;<br/>
mentality of school and school-at-home, I&#39;ve found a driven little girl that<br/>
is learning every day.<br/>
<br/>
Most importantly, I hear, &quot;Mom, I AM smart!&quot; and &quot;Look at what I&#39;ve figured<br/>
out!&quot;  The tears and frustration and the &quot;I am stupid&quot; are gone!  I have my<br/>
happy child back.<br/>

What does he want?    Do that. <br/>
<br/>
***Am I crazy? ***<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know you well enough to answer that question.&lt;g&gt;  But I&#39;d say, probably not.   There will be plenty of people who will think you&#39;re crazy if you take your kid out of school.   You wrote that you&#39;re a sensitive person.  Can you stand up to the questions and criticism that will likely come from choosing unschooling?   You don&#39;t have to answer that question on the list, just something for you to consider.   <br/>
<br/>
***Can I just pull him out and unschool at this point legally? ***<br/>
<br/>
Every state has it&#39;s own laws about exemption from compulsory school attendance.  Your best answer will come from unschoolers in your area.  Find and keep a copy of the law for your state so that you know what&#39;s required of you.  Here, we report each year to the county superintendent of schools and every year he wanted more information, claimed he *required* more information than I was legally obligated to give.   So, to avoid any confusion, get familiar with the law. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>One of the marvelous things about unschooling is that kids get to love learning again. All kids, all human beings, naturally enjoy learning, but school and school at home can put a big big damper on that joy, can turn &quot;learning&quot; into drudgery. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1335897207">You sound like a very caring Mom, not a crazy one! It is not too late. it fact, it is perfect timing. You&#39;re actions will show your son how much you are listening. Last year I pulled my 2nd and 3rd graders out of public with mid-may. We love the freedom so much.  I then pulled my 6th grader out (he was begging to come home) out of a very expensive private school. 3 weeks left of the year. The school was *shocked* because of how it would look on his *record*.<br/>
I am in CA and I didnt have to file until October of the next year. For the public school I did have to write a letter notifying them we were tranferring to a &#39;private&#39; school. They had IEP&#39;S and it was all fine. Just check your states laws. Know them going in. Our principal grilled me and told me all kinds of things I had to do, paper work I had to provide and tried to intimidate me. I was able to correct him  and walked out confident of my rights.  <br/>
For all of my boys, not having them finish the last few weeks of the year was my way of saying I was sorry I put them through that hell to start with. It was a brand new shiney start to our relationship.<br/>
Best of luck to you,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
  I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s going to happen, there are a few things my son doesn&#39;t want to miss coming up, but I&#39;m definitely ready to take the plunge if  my kids want it.<br/>
