<div id="ygrps-yiv-2113301347">I&#39;ve never thought of doing it that way... I speak<br/>
German, so as my son and I go to stores, etc I will<br/>
point out things and tell him what they are in<br/>
English, then in German. He hasn&#39;t really been<br/>
interested so far, but I&#39;m not pressuring him or anything.<br/>

say loves, manga.  It is a Japanese type of comic book.  It is <br/>
translated to English, but he finds the shows online and watchs them in <br/>
Japanese, English subtitles, and has learned some of the works from <br/>
this also.  He would much rather listen to the Japanese songs than the <br/>
English and he to has downloaded them to his mp3 player.  Funny how <br/>
they can pick this stuff up, their little minds amaze me.<br/>
He once told his great granny that his mind is like a dry sponge and <br/>
all of the knowledge in the world is like water, and his mind just <br/>
loves soaking up all of that water.  I thought it was a very good and <br/>

With the Japanese movies like Spirited Away, there are two different English<br/>

one is done in Japan and one in America, they&#39;re very different from one<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-254089896">My favorite movie for this is Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  In theaters,<br/>
the movie was in Mandarin, with English subtitles.  When it hit DVD, they<br/>
added an English voice track.  And it&#39;s amazing how well they dubbed it.<br/>
80% of the time, it looks like the characters&#39; mouths are actually forming<br/>
English words.  And the English dialogue is significantly different from the<br/>
English subtitles...they obviously edited the spoken words to more closely<br/>
match mouth movements.    <br/>
<br/>
I saw that movie at least 6 times in the theater, in Mandarin, and I still<br/>
enjoy it most in the original Mandarin, with or without subtitles.  I don&#39;t<br/>
know any Mandarin words, but it&#39;s a gorgeous movie.<br/>
<br/>
(A bit of trivia from the special features on the dvd:  only one of the<br/>
stars was a native Mandarin speaker, so most of the actors (who spoke<br/>
Cantonese or Taiwanese) spoke phonetically for the movie, really no<br/>
differently than a native English speaker would have had to do.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-232834311">The only caveat might be if you are trying to match<br/>
the subtitles with the foreign language that they<br/>
really do match up. I understand Italian but my kids<br/>
don&#39;t. I have discovered that listening to the Italian<br/>
while they read makes me crazy more often than not.<br/>
Take Life is Beautiful, the language is so beautiful<br/>
and so much of it is lost in the subtitling. La Strada<br/>
makes me howl because there is so much missing. Closed<br/>
captioning quality is often hit or miss,even on DVD&#39;s.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2133469619">Dd just turned 13, and we&#39;re picking up some Inuyasha manga today for  <br/>
our car trip! She has both the &quot;regular&quot; books and the &quot;ani- <br/>
manga&quot; (prefers the latter right now).<br/>
<br/>
I love your son&#39;s &quot;dry sponge&quot; analogy! And how cool that his great- <br/>
grandmother heard that from him.<br/>
<br/>
When dd was doing Aikido, one of the routines was to count in  <br/>
different languages while doing stretches. Dd was always embarrassed  <br/>
that she would just count in English (though sometimes she attempted  <br/>
French, since she could count to 10 en Francais). She didn&#39;t want to  <br/>
learn any other language (especially Japanese) when she was &quot;expected&quot;  <br/>
to (although I didn&#39;t expect it of her). Now she wants to learn  <br/>
because she loves all things Japanese at the moment. Except for Aikido  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Exposing, yes. Teaching, no.<br/>
<br/>
Exposing is &quot;Here&#39;s something cool&quot; and then letting go of caring  <br/>
whether they pick it up and run with it or not. One way of looking at  <br/>
it is treat everything like a coloring book. If you hand a child a  <br/>
coloring book you think they might like, you probably won&#39;t be  <br/>
fretting on whether they do it or not or how they do it! It becomes a  <br/>
&quot;Cool if they like it, cool if they don&#39;t.&quot; If they like it or don&#39;t  <br/>
like it, you learn a little more about who they are right now and can  <br/>
help them find more of what they like.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t make it to the bottom of my long post to Nikki, here&#39;s  <br/>
something Scott Noelle wrote as part of his &quot;Daily Groove&quot;. It&#39;s a  <br/>
question that a lot of new unschoolers struggle with: when helping  <br/>
them might not really be helping them but easing our fears. You can  <br/>
add &quot;incomplete&quot; or &quot;not knowledgeable in things I think are  <br/>
important to know&quot; to his list of helpless, damaged, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; THE DAILY GROOVE ~ by Scott Noelle<br/>
&gt; www.enjoyparenting.com/dailygroove<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; :: Helping vs. Co-creation ::<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    Q: How do you know when it&#39;s appropriate<br/>
&gt;        to offer your child help/assistance?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    A: When the offer feels *inspired* rather<br/>
&gt;        than fear-based.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you&#39;re coming from a perspective that your child is<br/>
&gt; helpless, damaged, weak, incompetent, lost, wrong,<br/>
&gt; etc., then your &quot;help&quot; will only give power to that<br/>
&gt; belief. It won&#39;t feel inspired to you, and it won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; inspire your child to connect with his or her Power.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But if you consciously shift your perspective to one<br/>
&gt; in which you see your child as capable of finding his<br/>
&gt; or her way, you won&#39;t feel like you &quot;should&quot; help, and<br/>
&gt; you probably won&#39;t offer to help unless asked.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; However, you might be *inspired* to get involved in a<br/>
&gt; way that doesn&#39;t feel like you&#39;re a &quot;have&quot; helping a<br/>
&gt; &quot;have-not&quot; -- it&#39;ll feel more like two souls playing<br/>
&gt; together, co-creating purely for the joy of it!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not with any kind of school-like agenda in my mind... that&#39;s the trick,<br/>
playing the dvds may *look* exactly the same in our homes, it&#39;s the<br/>
underlying *why* that makes all the difference.<br/>
If something seems cool/fun/exciting to me, I want to share this thrill<br/>
(like Princess Bride in French) -- not an underlying inkling of *oh I need<br/>
to expose Hayden to French and PB will help me reach that goal* The exposure<br/>
to French doesn&#39;t even register on my mama-radar because my point is the<br/>
sharing of excitement and the new discovery. I use ASL and Spanish for<br/>
phrases I think are just more fluent in those languages over English :)<br/>
Hayden has asked me not to sign to him or to use my voice when I do, or to<br/>
repeat my Spanish phrase with the English. I don&#39;t mind, I say those things<br/>
for *me* :)<br/>
Scotty (Super Cool Boyfriend) speaks French (to make international travel<br/>
easier) and loves to throw around phrases and endearments. If either Hayden<br/>
or I felt he was doing this for a reason other than his love of French<br/>
Language, we&#39;d both reject his approach, as we have really no interest or<br/>
use for French. Because SCB is sharing is *LOVE of French* we&#39;ve picked up<br/>
quite a bit and H & I are actually thinking about taking the French I class<br/>
at the local community college.It has way more to do with sharing what SCB<br/>
loves than it is &quot;learning a second language.&quot;<br/>
I know some of the things that Hayden thinks are cool/fun/exciting and I<br/>
will share those things as I come across them too -- a gamers magazine for<br/>
example, he loves receiving them and looking through them and reading what&#39;s<br/>
coming up and what he may like to save his money for. These magazines<br/>
improve his reading ability, his reading comprehension and great vocabulary<br/>
exposure -- as a BONUS, *not* *not* NOT the reason I subscribe in the first<br/>
place.<br/>
Whenever I think of sharing information, I listen carefully to the little,<br/>
niggling voices in my head who give me great insight into the *why* of<br/>
anything I do... if there&#39;s something fear-based or stuck-in-school-think<br/>
about what I&#39;m going to do, I wait until I can do this thing with no agenda,<br/>
no greater-purpose beyond this moment right here...<br/>

<br/>
I expose my kids ALL THE TIME to new and interesting stuff.<br/>
<br/>
But the idea isn&#39;t to teach them stuff. It is to expose them to stuff.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t play games in order to teach them words or math or strategies. <br/>
We play games for FUN.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t go to live performances with the hope that they&#39;ll learn <br/>
something. We go to live performances to see live performances and to <br/>
have fFUN!<br/>
<br/>
It just so happens that they learn all sorts of neat things as a *side <br/>
effect* of having fun.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all in the *intention*. I don&#39;t INTEND to teach them something. My <br/>
*intent* is to have FUN!<br/>
<br/>
All that learning that happens anyway is just a cool side effect!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-467237249">Thank you for the clarity!  I actually got the Muzzy program off of<br/>
e-bay because we have extended family members who are from Italy, who<br/>
dd gets to see about twice a month.  She had started picking up a few<br/>
words here and there, so I thought she might enjoy more.  As it is,<br/>
she begs for the DVD generally within moments of waking up.  If she<br/>
weren&#39;t interested, I obviously wouldn&#39;t bother with it.<br/>
<br/>
It gives me more to think about as far as how and where to draw the<br/>
lines between things I think she might enjoy and what she&#39;s truly<br/>
interested in.  At this age, it can be a bit of a tough call.  <br/>
