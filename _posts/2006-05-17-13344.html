<div id="ygrps-yiv-1945749643">Hello!<br/>
<br/>
I have been reading the posts over the last couple of days. I really <br/>
don&#39;t know where to begin.<br/>
<br/>
How about here...<br/>
<br/>
I began homeschooling in &quot;kindergarden&quot; having bought into the &quot;you <br/>
have to have your kid at a table and learn with textbooks and forced <br/>
art projects that I have decided to do&quot; approach.<br/>
<br/>
As children go, she is not a &quot;table&quot; child and resented being there. <br/>
I fought, argued, struggled, cried the whole time as did she. But, <br/>
at least she wasn&#39;t in &quot;public&quot; school.<br/>
<br/>
We did this through to 2nd grade, when I finally sent her to public <br/>
school. By this time I had given birth to my 3rd child.<br/>
<br/>
We homeschooled again in 3rd grade and while I still hadn&#39;t shaken <br/>
all my &quot;expectations&quot; of myself and her...fitting into other <br/>
people&#39;s boxes...we enjoyed the year more, cirriculum free. We used <br/>
the library and read, I taught language Arts the way I wanted to. <br/>
While we still had tons of &quot;at the table&quot; and still the constant <br/>
drill of &quot;FOCUS!&quot; and &quot;do your work!&quot;, it was less than before.<br/>
<br/>
Something had been planted in me on our REALLY good days. Something <br/>
was taking form...I was starting to wake up.<br/>
<br/>
So what did I do?<br/>
<br/>
I got her into a private school. I was happy about this, the kids <br/>
were great, there was a strong sense of community, the teacher to <br/>
child ratio was low.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time I began &quot;homeschooling&quot; my second daughter through <br/>
and ISP. I KNEW that she wouldnt&#39; fit into the &quot;system&quot; when I <br/>
started her, but I had no idea the pressure would be so much. It has <br/>
gotten so bad, the CT TOLD me (as if she had to) to READ to my <br/>
daughter. I said I did and she smiled and nodded and said, yes, <br/>
well, make a list of the books you have read to her so when I come, <br/>
I can see!!!!!! <br/>
My daughter sits a table and completes 4-6 hours of school work <br/>
(because she is not a fast paperworker) in order to stay up with the <br/>
work assigned so we can stay out of truancy issues. EVERY SINGLE <br/>
PAPER requires her writing. The CT asked me when I didn&#39;t have <br/>
the &quot;Writing practices&quot; done, what we did for writing!? I picked up <br/>
the stack of papers and said, &quot;Every single paper requires her to <br/>
write. I think this is sufficient.&quot; She said, &quot;well she needs more <br/>
practice&quot; I told her &quot;Listen, Sadee&#39;s handwriting won&#39;t always look <br/>
like a first grader&#39;s handwriting. What you see on these papers is <br/>
her dislike and extreme bordem with sitting hours on end at a table.&quot;<br/>
She said to me &quot;that&#39;s why you give breaks&quot;. You think?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We are nearing the end of this year and the lessons I have learned <br/>
this year have been beyond where I thought I could ever expand. I <br/>
was a fool not to trust my instincts. I was living under so much <br/>
fear that what &quot;they said&quot; was true. I don&#39;t have a certificate, and <br/>
I can&#39;t teach my child.<br/>
<br/>
This year my eldest, Rivka, started school a bright, energetic, red <br/>
head! She was positive and helpful and respectful. <br/>
We are near the end of the year and she is drawing strength from <br/>
knowing that she doesn&#39;t have to go next year.<br/>
She is tired, grumpy, negative, and FAR less interested daily in <br/>
familial activities. She is aware of all this (which amazes me) and <br/>
is counting the days and putting in extra effort toward keeping a <br/>
postivive attitude.<br/>
<br/>
I guess somehow I needed this year to marinade...or grow up.<br/>
<br/>
I get it now. I really get it.<br/>
<br/>
And you know what?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m gonna follow the CT&#39;s advice and give my kids a break.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1234048176">Hi Rue,<br/>
<br/>
Yes, she could. But we made an aggrement that I feel somewhat <br/>
compelled to stick to. I seriously considered weather or not it <br/>
would be in her best interest to pull her a few months ago, but <br/>
decided that in the long run she will be better for having had the <br/>
experience and kept up her end of an aggreement. She will feel as if <br/>
she succeeded in this.<br/>
<br/>
She BEGGED to go to this school. Its where all of her friends go and <br/>
she wanted more than anything to go. I explained that from what I <br/>
had heard it was a VERY demanding school and I played out everything <br/>
she is going through now at the beginning of the year. She said if <br/>
we could get her in, she would work hard and it would all be worth <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s in. It really stressed us financially all year to do this for <br/>
(maybe *to* her) but as aggrements go...<br/>
<br/>
She will bounce back and I can see it more clearly as we near the <br/>
end of the year.<br/>
<br/>
It was a choice we made together and now will follow through with.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s much healthier to recognize when a choice is not serving you<br/>
well, and change course. Following through with something just because<br/>
you signed up, is a poor reason for finishing if it&#39;s sucking joy from<br/>
your life.<br/>
<br/>
Much better to help children realize they can change their minds,<br/>
change their lives, change for the better at any time.<br/>

<br/>
I began unschooling my daughter (8 yr old) only 3 months and 8 days ago, and she has <br/>
changed so much, she has gone from insecure, sullen, angry, to the child I used to have, she <br/>
loves to learn, and we really have fun again.  I wish I had done this earlier, but she didn&#39;t <br/>
want to!!  We are still deschooling (the whole family), but we are on the right track.  Welcome <br/>
to the list and the journey!!!  It is amazing.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1254949290">Good Morning!<br/>
<br/>
Interesting story. You obviously have a lot of passion about your <br/>
decisions. Being able to learn from our past is very important.<br/>
<br/>
If this were any other school, I wouldn&#39;t be a stickler for staying <br/>
in. But it isn&#39;t. And the people she attends school with (teachers, <br/>
students, and volunteers, and other parents) are all people she has <br/>
built meaningful relationships with. <br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have problems with children being mean to one another any <br/>
more than you might see siblings argue. It&#39;s the only place on earth <br/>
like, I am sure. And the school only goes up to the 6th grade. My <br/>
daughter is in 4th grade and neither she nor the children in her <br/>
class are much interested in cool. It&#39;s NOTHING like any other <br/>
private school or public school I have ever seen.<br/>
<br/>
Our problem here isn&#39;t the other kids, or her inability to maintin <br/>
her values taught in our home. What our problem is, is the amount of <br/>
school work and classroom time and hours of homework, and lack of <br/>
sleep or play time. I consider the approach cruel. But many children <br/>
come out of this school, well developed, high acheivers. Tired. But <br/>
good kids and I know this because I have attend our synagogue (and <br/>
am friends) with many of the children who have been through it.<br/>
<br/>
I have pulled her from school before. But the situation is different <br/>
here. Even she agrees that she should finish the year. Pretty decent <br/>
insight for a 10 year old. She knows I don&#39;t worry much about what <br/>
she gets on her reprot card, tests, etc...I only care that she <br/>
tries. And you know what? She does well.<br/>
<br/>
Part of the education I want her to have is that just because <br/>
something is difficult for a time, doesn&#39;t mean one should just bail <br/>
on it. If this were a &quot;years on end&quot; type thing, we could <br/>
reconsider. <br/>
<br/>
Besides, I AM pulling her out. I am NOT forcing her to finish the <br/>
next 2 years at the school. (which, by the opinion of many people I <br/>
should) We (my daughter and I and her Dad) have decided to finish <br/>
what we started, because she is able to.<br/>
<br/>
We have so much to look forward to this next year.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-660762387">The experience isn&#39;t all bad. Like I said there are some very strong <br/>
and valid reasons to let her finish these last 2 weeks.<br/>
<br/>
I know it has been challenging for her, but I have seen her grow in <br/>
some very important ways this year. For example, she has learned <br/>
that even when she FEELS grumpy, she should still treat others with <br/>
respect. I watch her do it and it amazes me! <br/>
<br/>
She WANTS to finish the year. It&#39;s not a decision made because I <br/>
don&#39;t understand that institutionalization isn&#39;t good for her. But <br/>
in reality this situation isn&#39;t completly without its benefits for <br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, life in large part is learning how to bounce back when we <br/>
don&#39;t always make the decisions we should have to begin with.<br/>
<br/>
AND, I don&#39;t totally regret this  year. It has taught me some very <br/>
strong and lasting lessons which will HUGELY benefit my babies. I am <br/>
sure it has done the same for her.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the input.<br/>

Ahhh... That&#39;s a whole different thing. I thought that you said she was unhappy because I read this:<br/>
This year my eldest, Rivka, started school a bright, energetic, red<br/>
head! She was positive and helpful and respectful.<br/>
We are near the end of the year and she is drawing strength from<br/>
knowing that she doesn&#39;t have to go next year.<br/>
She is tired, grumpy, negative, and FAR less interested daily in<br/>
familial activities. She is aware of all this (which amazes me) and<br/>
is counting the days and putting in extra effort toward keeping a<br/>
postivive attitude.When I recently took a promotion to night manager at the restaurant, I was determined to do well and make them proud.My family after two weeks said to me, &quot;You&#39;re tired, really grumpy, you never are around and when you are you&#39;d rather be elsewhere(Usually sleeping)Do you really love you job? I said no but....They lovingly informed me that if I quit, I won&#39;t be a failure, they missed me being there and being happy and it was really okay to do so.I did choose to leave that position although if I had chosen to stay, I would have done so knowing that the ones I love  showed how much they care by giving me &quot;permission&quot; to do what was not the typical responsible adult thing.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-892390976">Yes, all thoes things are true. But I even asked her again yesterday <br/>
and she still says she wants to finish.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that big of an issue. She is almost finished with the year. <br/>
Like I said, if it were the beginning of the year or it was a public <br/>
school or any other school, I would pull her. But it&#39;s not the case <br/>
and to explain why this is the right thing to do is just too <br/>
exhausting and not so easy to get across.<br/>
<br/>
This is a very tightly knit Jewish community and there are very real <br/>
bonds here between people at school (who are not only at school, but <br/>
in our lives often) and our family.<br/>
<br/>
She will be fine. And we are going to relish every minute of this <br/>
next year. She expressed her desire to stay to finsih the year, even <br/>
though it&#39;s not easy all the time, its still valueable to her. So we <br/>
are making this decision because we think its healthy for her.<br/>
<br/>
I have already given her permission to leave. Still, we are counting <br/>
the days till we are through! :)<br/>
<br/>
I really do want the best for my daughter and I really do know that <br/>
institutionalizing her isn&#39;t it.<br/>
<br/>
We are homeschoolers at heart. It&#39;s the unschooling that I am <br/>
somewhat new to. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you, for being concerned. I can tell this will be a good <br/>
group. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-400869168">Hello I am new to this list.<br/>
<br/>
My son Emile is now 6 and will stay home from public school this year.<br/>
Last year was so forced that his stress levels showed through his<br/>
chewing holes in all his shirts, some so much that I cut them off.<br/>
His teacher even said about the teaching to the test, that she didn&#39;t know<br/>
when she was getting her teaching degree that Kindgarten would be 1 st<br/>
grade. My son&#39;s school stressed reading and writing everyday. Very little<br/>
creative play and no time for lunch. We sent him by not following our<br/>
own likes but subcomed to neighbor pressure and less than .05 don&#39;t send<br/>
their kids.<br/>
<br/>
So I join this list to learn more about unschooling as the pressure mounts<br/>
from family to &quot;explain&quot; our choice. It really feels like a choice. A relief<br/>
a big relief to not go on the wheel again this fall.<br/>
<br/>
How many people are writing roughly on this list?<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-467646623">Thanks for the detailed directions. My son Emile was loved being home till<br/>
we sent him last year, now we&#39;re back. And yes people think they are doing<br/>
coomunity service by conviencing us to not unschool. like weddings that are<br/>
only male and female- comfort and reassurance that what they have done- got<br/>
married to one person-- is the only way.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Heck, I told MYSELF this, for years! Coming from such a strong schooled background and education career, with all my former colleagues being professional educators one way or another, this gave me much-needed peace of mind to enjoy those early years at home and not worry overmuch about how they would handle high-stakes tests and high school and college and competitive careers, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
I had to overcome thoughts like what if I die and they have to be put in school at an awkward age of divergence from the norm.  What if their dad dies and I have to go to work, same worry. What if -- what if -- morbid mom worries.  (I would have had big worries if we&#39;d been schooling, I&#39;m sure. I kept telling myself we could always get back into &quot;school&quot; if need be but that being locked into just one place is more to worry about than being locked out of just one place.)</div>
