<div id="ygrps-yiv-1679592494">***&quot;So rather than limiting, I was trying to suggest that people keep an<br/>
eye on it. Which apparently everyone who unschools already does.&quot;***<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And how about keeping both eyes on it?  ;)  How about sitting with<br/>
them and getting into their world.  If you have the urge, create a<br/>
character and give it try.  The joy that we&#39;ve had around our house<br/>
playing together is so incredible.  I know not everyone is a gamer but<br/>
make sure you know what your gamers are up to.  Not in the &quot;you better<br/>
watch out&quot; way, but in the &quot;be in their world&quot; way.  Ask them about<br/>
their games, find out what they&#39;re liking about it... be part of it.  It can totally change the dynamics of your relationship; especially<br/>
if you&#39;ve never looked into their gaming passions.<br/>
<br/>
I so wish people could view WoW and gaming just like any other interest.  A friend of mine just wrote a blog post about passions and obsessions, she was referring to Kelly&#39;s post about obsessions.  She mentioned that when people are obsessing about something &quot;impressive&quot; it&#39;s all good.   Like when I was in college and studying French, I would study so much some times that I would dream in French.  Did people think I was studying too much?  nah...  They thought it was great that I was becoming bilingual &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
Or how about my husband, dang it... he has to sell his product (he&#39;s in sales) ... jeez I bet he spent 8 - 10 hours working!   But,  if my daughter comes to me and says she dreams of WoW, people would be alarmed.  Or if my daugher and son play 8 - 10 hours of WoW in one day... it&#39;s different then.   <br/>
<br/>
These games are very complex games and there are so many things to do.  It&#39;s not like they&#39;re only doing 1 thing, it&#39;s all inclusive, it&#39;s amazing.  <br/>
<br/>
Am I worried about an addiction with the game?  Nope.  If I never ever talked with my son, or never ever offered my children anything else to do.. then there would be concern.  If they were sitting in front of their computers and not happy about it I would also be concerned, but these kids are enjoying what they are doing and very engaged.  It&#39;s so different from an addiction case.  <br/>
<br/>
Happy busy homes don&#39;t lend themselves to addictions.. really.<br/>
<br/>
You have to look at the big picture.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-461411134">In our home it isn&#39;t WoW it is COH/COV, not to mention Pokemon, PS2 games, etc. We are a family of gamers and we do play together. From time to time either myself or my husband will mention a different activity for a change of pace, something new and different. I am not concerned on the days that come along where any one of us spends hour playing a game. They are actually few and far between, we spend so much time on the go or doing other projects together. Now if anyone were concerned with a harmful obsession in my home it would probably be the number of ongoing craft projects that cover the gamit and grow all the time. LOL Some days it is dangerous to walk into our house, you never know what is going on.  <br/>
