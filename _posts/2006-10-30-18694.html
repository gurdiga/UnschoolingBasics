<div id="ygrps-yiv-2085619836">I have a question concerning learning to write with unschooling.  We are fairly new to <br/>
unschooling, it&#39;s been approx. 6 months since we have embraced radical unschooling, and <br/>
our children are still quite young, 4.5 and 12 months old.  Anyway our 4.5 year old has <br/>
never been interested in writing, I know I shouldn&#39;t compare him to other kids his age, <br/>
especially ones that go to school, but it just dawned on me the other day when I was <br/>
watching my nephew (age 4) write his family&#39;s names on a piece of paper, that Damek has <br/>
yet to write any letters.  We also have some close friends (who are fellow unschoolers) and <br/>
their, just turned 3 year old, has been writing letters for a few months now.  <br/>
<br/>
How does writing happen naturally?  I&#39;m just wondering from others who have watched <br/>
this happen firsthand how it happens without sitting down and &quot;teaching&quot; them. <br/>
<br/>
I just finished reading the article titled &#39;Jesse&#39;s Story&#39; by Sue Whitson in the new issue of <br/>
Live Free Learn Free, and I think already it has put a lot of my fears to rest, and I conclude <br/>
that when he has a need/want to write then he will learn to write or ask his dad & I for <br/>
help?  <br/>
<br/>
I think the other thing that brought it to my attention was that my mother-in-law just gave <br/>
him a pre-school workbook and in there they had some kind of &quot;writing&quot; exercises where <br/>
you trace along the straight/diagonal lines to, I assume, get a feeling for writing.  Damek <br/>
seemed like he was having fun doing the dot to dots in the book and the mazes, but he <br/>
doesn&#39;t like to color, so he said he wanted to skip the coloring pages, and then when he <br/>
came to these, he asked me what the dotted lines were for, and I told & showed him how <br/>
you trace them, and he just started drawing circles around the dotted lines saying &quot;I do it <br/>
like this&quot;, and he had fun doing it his own way.  Thank goodness it was me sitting down <br/>
with him rather than his Oma who gave him the book, because I&#39;m sure she would have <br/>
promptly corrected him by saying &quot;no, you are supposed to do it this way&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
I would appreciate some more insight on this,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1766218550">My kids are just 5 and 3.  They both do some writing.  My 3 year old mostly <br/>
his name and Mom are all he is interested in.. although he can write a some <br/>
other letters cause I have heard him tell his brother how to write them.  My <br/>
5 year old writes things sometimes.  He likes to copy the names from his <br/>
pokemon cards.  He makes lists of things he wants to do but with pictures. <br/>
He will often ask me how to spell something and if there is a letter he <br/>
doesnt know how to write then he will ask how ot write it (hense his brother <br/>
showing him). This being said both my kids (my older son especially) like to <br/>
color and draw and seem to enjoy fine motor tasks.  My 5 year old is very <br/>
good at cutting and has been a while. He likes art alot.  I know other <br/>
people whose kids are in this age range and have absolutely no interest in <br/>
writing.  I think that is very typical and nothing to worry about.  Neither <br/>
of my kids like workbooks or tracing letters etc..<br/>

writing serve his 4.5 yo self?<br/>
<br/>
If no one is making your 4 yo nephew write, then he&#39;s doing it  <br/>
because he thinks it&#39;s fun and challenging and interesting, because  <br/>
it serve some internal need.<br/>
<br/>
When your son finds a need to write, he&#39;ll write. There are things  <br/>
you can do to help: keeping paper and things to write with freely  <br/>
available. Offer to write down his stories for him. Ask him if he&#39;d  <br/>
like you to add a caption to a picture he&#39;s drawn (and be perfectly  <br/>
okay if he says no), do Mad Libs with him when he&#39;s old enough to  <br/>
find them funny (you fill in the blanks).<br/>
<br/>
There are things you can do to make him want to avoid writing: worry  <br/>
about it, pressure him even in a light &quot;fun&quot; way, make him.<br/>

<br/>
People learn *anything* because they find it personally meaningful  <br/>
(which can include fun!) and useful. And writing *is* useful! When  <br/>
*he* needs to write, he&#39;ll write.<br/>

  Cameron and I were discussing this the other day. We&#39;ve enjoyed <br/>
watching Duncan&#39;s progression in reading, writing, math, etc. Cameron&#39;s <br/>
old enough to *watch* it and be impressed.<br/>
<br/>
  Our conversation wandered into territory that I thought would make a <br/>
funny tongue-in-cheek article for Connections.<br/>
<br/>
 Please pardon my humor, but let&#39;s make some substitutions here:<br/>
<br/>
 I know I shouldn&#39;t compare him to other kids<br/>
  his age, especially ones that go to school, but it just dawned on me <br/>
the other day when I<br/>
 was watching my nephew (age 10) smoking, that<br/>

filterless Camels for a few months now.<br/>
<br/>

 was watching my nephew (age 12) drinkng a beer, that<br/>
  Damek has yet to drink any alcohol. We also have some close friends <br/>
(who are fellow<br/>
  unschoolers) and their, just turned 11 year old, has been downing <br/>
vodka for a few months now.<br/>

  Damek has yet to have sex. We also have some close friends (who are <br/>

on for a few months now.<br/>

heroin for a few months now.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Sooner isn&#39;t necessarily better.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I can&#39;t stress enough how silly it is to compare kids. They do it when <br/>
they are ready. Some will do it before they are ready if kept away from <br/>
it, and some will do it later if pushed. Patience and acceptance of Who <br/>
They Are NOW.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-390997429">Before fully embracing unschooling, I waffled back and forth between <br/>
school at home and unschooling (without knowing that is what I was <br/>
doing) for a long time.  (My DD&#39;s are 6 and 9). At the beginning of <br/>
last year I decided enough was enough (rolling eyes at myself) and <br/>
they were going to get the basics down! I printed worksheets, bought <br/>
those little laminate cards and books, made alphabet flash cards and <br/>
spelling lists, blah blah blah, yadda yadda yadda.  We sat down <br/>
every morning, practice practice practice makes perfect y&#39;know <br/>
(again rolling eyes at myself.)  We struggled, and fought, and cried <br/>
everyday for 2 months.  My youngest still didn&#39;t know her alphabet <br/>
and neither childs handwriting was where it *should* be.  Finally, I <br/>
came to my senses and let it go.  About a week later my youngest <br/>
picked up the phone book and a notebook and started writing.  That <br/>
is the event that turned the tables for me.  My then 5 year old <br/>
teaching HERSELF to write from the phonebook.  Neither of my kids <br/>
are probably as proficient in writing as their schooled <br/>
counterparts.  Who cares.  I have no doubt it will get better <br/>
because now they write what interests them.  It might be my &quot;order&quot; <br/>
when playing restaurant.  It might be my name when they are making <br/>
me a card.  It might be some unknown language that only they know <br/>
the code to.  But they write, everyday! Practice practice practice <br/>
makes perfect y&#39;know ;). Now I wonder why I even cared. But that is <br/>
another story for another day. <br/>
<br/>
I know this didn&#39;t actually happen as naturally as you want it to <br/>
for your son.  But it will happen.  He&#39;ll come to you one day and <br/>
ask how to write *A* or he&#39;ll pick up a phone book and figure it out <br/>
for himself.  Either way, soon enough he&#39;ll be writing, probably <br/>
everyday!  My oldest, who has had to endure much more of my <br/>
craziness than my younger, struggles much more with writing than my <br/>
youngest does.  She is typing *with her eyes closed* though.  Funny, <br/>
we never fought about THAT :D. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-89298805">&quot;Ask yourself why a 4.5 yo would need to write. What purpose would<br/>
writing serve his 4.5 yo self?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is a really good thing to remember.<br/>
In our age of &quot;earlier is better&quot; people seem to think that very young<br/>
children SHOULD be learning to read, write and compute math on paper.<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s useful for most kids that age, so they SHOULD be<br/>
doing other things!:)<br/>
<br/>
My 5y.o. writes letters that are made up occasionally, that&#39;s the<br/>
extent of his interest in writing at the moment. My 13 y.o. just found<br/>
real life uses for writing this last year and is writing beautifully now.<br/>
Would you be ok with your 8 y.o. not having an interest in reading or<br/>
writing? Your 11 y.o.? Mine was 12 before it became useful enough for<br/>
him to become fluent. Age matters not.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-33369590">My 7 yr old only writes his name.  Unless theres a paper to copy from and he&#39;ll do that happily.  Yesterday he wanted to write me a note, so he came to me with his pencil and paper and asked me how to spell mom.  He said he knew it started with m, so I told him the other letters.  He then wrote on his paper, &quot;mom Joe.&quot;  That was his love note to me.  Very very precious!  <br/>
   <br/>
  His writing isn&#39;t anywhere near what a 7 yr old in school would be, but really why would it need to be?  I don&#39;t &quot;make&quot; him set down and do lesson work, so really he can just either copy the word from something or ask me.  The main thing here is when he has a personal need/want to write something down, he&#39;ll find the way.  He just recently started to LOVE to color.  ~Our house is plastered with halloween coloring pages~ So we&#39;ve been buying coloring books at every trip to town by his request.  He also loves to draw.  So without me trying to force him to write he&#39;s definitely strengthening those hand skills by coloring and drawing, which is his own way.  My other 2 sons writing skills came by the same force.  I also never force them to write in cursive, but my 12 yr old son the other day was asked to &quot;sign&quot; his name on his hunting license, so he now wants to learn to write in cursive.  At his request, he wants me to write in cursive as he dictates to me.  Then he goes<br/>
 about trying to write in cursive.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I think what you need to remember is it&#39;s amazing what they learn when they are ready to learn.  Not one of my 4 children were ready to learn to write at 4.5 yrs old.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1731313338">Right now he is totally enamoured with anything space related (solar system, stars, moon, <br/>
ect...), and has been making up space related stories when he plays and recently has <br/>
begun asking me to write down what he tells me.  <br/>
<br/>
When you compare it to learning to speak, it just sounds like common sense that he will <br/>
learn eventually, I just need to trust him, which is what unschooling is all about right?  I <br/>
guess people just learn anything, when they are interested, naturally.  <br/>

&gt; Ask yourself why a 4.5 yo would need to write. What purpose would  <br/>
&gt; writing serve his 4.5 yo self?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If no one is making your 4 yo nephew write, then he&#39;s doing it  <br/>
&gt; because he thinks it&#39;s fun and challenging and interesting, because  <br/>
&gt; it serve some internal need.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When your son finds a need to write, he&#39;ll write. There are things  <br/>
&gt; you can do to help: keeping paper and things to write with freely  <br/>
&gt; available. Offer to write down his stories for him. Ask him if he&#39;d  <br/>
&gt; like you to add a caption to a picture he&#39;s drawn (and be perfectly  <br/>
&gt; okay if he says no), do Mad Libs with him when he&#39;s old enough to  <br/>
&gt; find them funny (you fill in the blanks).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are things you can do to make him want to avoid writing: worry  <br/>
&gt; about it, pressure him even in a light &quot;fun&quot; way, make him.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; How does writing happen naturally?  I&#39;m just wondering from others  <br/>
&gt; &gt; who have watched<br/>
&gt; &gt; this happen firsthand how it happens without sitting down and  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;teaching&quot; them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How did speaking happen without teaching?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; People learn *anything* because they find it personally meaningful  <br/>
&gt; (which can include fun!) and useful. And writing *is* useful! When  <br/>
&gt; *he* needs to write, he&#39;ll write.<br/>

<br/>
Before we discovered unschooling, Parker was 3 and I<br/>
read  some tip about lamenating cards for children to<br/>
trace to learn how to write. I gave him the cards<br/>
after I made them and a marker. Okay so at first he<br/>
had tons of fun writing all over himself. But he did<br/>
learn to trace the letters. He loved them. But I<br/>
didn&#39;t really teach him anything. I let him play with<br/>
them. He writes his own way. Even at 5, he still likes<br/>
to get them out and play with them. <br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-575122467">My 15 yo has written two novels and starts her third tomorrow  <br/>
(NANOWRIMO).<br/>
<br/>
She did not write almost anything until she was 12 or so.<br/>
<br/>
When we don&#39;t try to teach kids &quot;on schedule,&quot; they will learn at  <br/>
widely varying times. One of my kids learned to read fluently at 3  <br/>
years old and another at 8 years old. A 17 yo unschooler I know well  <br/>
didn&#39;t learn to read until he was 12 or 13. It is to be expected. My  <br/>
suggestion to you is to stop comparing your kid to other kids - look  <br/>
ONLY at your own kid and notice what he IS doing, not what he isn&#39;t  <br/>
doing. You never help a kid by focusing on what he doesn&#39;t know - you  <br/>
help them by supporting what they ARE doing, what they enjoy, what  <br/>
they are passionately pursuing. This is where trust is required for  <br/>
unschooling parents - you have to be totally okay with kids learning  <br/>
on their own timetable. You have to be so sure that the WILL learn  <br/>
what they need to learn that you simply stop worrying about it - you  <br/>
live each hour of each day enjoying what your kids are doing, not  <br/>
feeling concerned about what they aren&#39;t doing.<br/>
<br/>
Also - please be careful about words like &quot;never&quot; and &quot;always.&quot; I bet  <br/>
that at least a few times your 4 1/2 year old HAS been interested in  <br/>
letters or words. And if you think in absolute terms, you&#39;ll miss  <br/>
those moments when he IS interested, because they&#39;ll seem small and  <br/>
insignificant to you.<br/>
<br/>
Writing is about having something to say. The BEST road to writing is  <br/>
lots and lots of great experiences, lots of discussion, lots of  <br/>
pretend play, lots of stories and tv and movies and games and,  <br/>
eventually, a reason to want to write something down. Every time he  <br/>
tells you about a game he is playing or about the lego creation and  <br/>
just made, or about what he did at his friend&#39;s house, or anything  <br/>
else, THAT is him practicing &quot;writing.&quot; Later, he&#39;ll learn to get it  <br/>
on paper if there is reason for it, but that is just a technicality.<br/>
<br/>
If you are worrying about the mechanics of writing letters - please  <br/>
don&#39;t. ANY activity that involves him using his arms, hands, and  <br/>
fingers, is helping him develop the muscles he&#39;ll eventually use in  <br/>
writing. He doesn&#39;t need to actually BE writing to develop those  <br/>
small muscles.<br/>
<br/>
There is GREAT danger in too-early academics. I&#39;ve seen it - I&#39;ve  <br/>
watched schools and homeschool parents doing academics with young  <br/>
children and watched the children develop supposed learning  <br/>
disabilities. I am firmly convinced that those disabilities would  <br/>
never have arisen if the children were allowed to play and learn at  <br/>
their own speed. Don&#39;t feel pangs of worry that your child is behind  <br/>
other young children who appear to be doing academics - feel SORRY  <br/>
for those families because they are very likely to be facing a number  <br/>
of possible problems that result FROM pushing the early academics.  <br/>
Even if they manage to not create learning disabilities, there lots  <br/>
of other negative consequences possible. Please read &quot;Miseducation:  <br/>
Preschoolers at Risk&quot; by David Elkind. His ideas and evidence is  <br/>
applied to kids 5 and under - but I truly believe that his arguments  <br/>
are equally true for older kids, too.<br/>

<br/>
FEW of them are actually writing - they copy and they often can&#39;t  <br/>
even do that very well.<br/>
<br/>
Many 9 year olds, in school, aren&#39;t reading yet.<br/>

Just because something is &quot;taught,&quot; doesn&#39;t mean kids are actually  <br/>
