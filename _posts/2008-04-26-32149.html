she would be switching campuses so I don&#39;t know if we simply just<br/>

I am sure there has to be some Texans on this list, but just in case, Google your states requirements.  Another option is to find what we in Florida call an umbrella school. <br/>

In essence, you homeschool through your own private school, but <br/>
happily, very little is required of you.  You might consider writing up <br/>
a request for her records from her current school on some semi-formal <br/>
looking paper from your new *private school*.<br/>

Not always as accurately as they should though. HSLDA likes to have<br/>
statistics to back up homeschooling, because they are a political<br/>
group NOT an activist group.<br/>
<br/>
So they don&#39;t always list the BEST options for unschoolers, which<br/>
include umbrella schools. Or they simply mention it without any<br/>
details. You&#39;re better off reading the law at a TX site and getting in<br/>
touch with local unschoolers for further clarification.<br/>
<br/>
TX is one of the easiest states for homeschooling. There is no reason<br/>
to make your child wait....you have the right to withdraw him now. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1849544151">Yes, you need to get her off the roll books but once that&#39;s done<br/>
(usually a letter to the school saying she won&#39;t be coming back suffices<br/>
- make sure if you mail it, that it&#39;s sent certified with a receipt so<br/>
that you know that it was received), TX requires little else.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Looking directly at the statutes is a good idea, if they exist. There  <br/>
are plenty of states without any homeschooling law (private school  <br/>
states, for example). And there are states where there are other,  <br/>
often better, options for homeschooling in ways other than their  <br/>
specific homeschooling law. Also, the legal statutes can be very  <br/>
complicated and it can be difficult to figure out what you actually  <br/>
are required to &quot;do&quot; based on them.<br/>
<br/>
California has no law, right now. Texas has a court decision, not a  <br/>
statute. There are lots of other states that don&#39;t have  <br/>
straightforward homeschooling law.<br/>
<br/>
Not being a state organization, HSLDA tends to be slightly &quot;off&quot; in  <br/>
the way they convey the information - it isn&#39;t presented in a way that  <br/>
is realistic, not necessarily presented the way the laws are carried  <br/>
out in practice. And the wording is sometimes oddly misleading.<br/>
<br/>
For example, in California, it says one option is to &quot;qualify as a  <br/>
private school.&quot;  That makes it sound like you have to be approved to  <br/>
be a private school, that there is something you have to do to  <br/>
qualify. But that is totally wrong - you become a private school by  <br/>
simply being one. The minute you decide to take your own child&#39;s  <br/>
education into your own hands, you ARE a private school. You don&#39;t  <br/>
have to qualify at all.<br/>
<br/>
Another option we have here is to enroll our kids in a private school  <br/>
independent study program - but HSLDA uses the term &quot;satellite  <br/>
program.&quot; That is misleading - we don&#39;t call these private school  <br/>
isp&#39;s &quot;satellite programs.&quot; That term is commonly used for brick and  <br/>
mortar schools with one main campus and other &quot;satellite&quot; campuses.  <br/>
But many of the private isp&#39;s are not associated with any brick and  <br/>
mortar school - there is no main campus to be a satellite of.<br/>
<br/>
Many many Californians homeschool through charter school programs.  <br/>
These are different than public school district independent study  <br/>
programs - they operate under different regulations. But, because they  <br/>
are also government funded, HSLDA doesn&#39;t differentiate between public  <br/>
school isp&#39;s and charter school programs. It is an important  <br/>
distinction to many California homeschoolers, but HSLDA completely  <br/>
ignores it.<br/>
<br/>
HSLDA is not a state-level organization, they consist of a few  <br/>
attorneys, each representing a large number of states, they just don&#39;t  <br/>
quite get things as &quot;right&quot; as the state organizations do.<br/>
