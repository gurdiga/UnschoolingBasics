<div id="ygrps-yiv-1242496732">Hello :)<br/>
<br/>
We are happily RUNing with our 13yo ds in the Treasure Valley Area.  We <br/>
are not really new to unschooling at all but being that I have a teen, <br/>
younger/new families are often looking to us for advice.  I love this <br/>
list because there are so many great ideas for new/transitioning <br/>
families, it really helps me to remember what it was like for us and <br/>
understand what new families are going through :)<br/>
<br/>
If any of you are from our area and want to visit with other local <br/>
unschoolers we just started a new group and a collaborative web project <br/>
that is being primarily developed by the kids.  Come & see us  and help <br/>
us make them into something great :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
Chris in Boise<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-844367494">Hail!<br/>
<br/>
Just a note to let our fellow Idaho Unschoolers know that the email <br/>
addy for the group owner has changed to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:infreondscipe@...">infreondscipe@...</a>.  <br/>
Same person, same great group, just a new Yahoo name!  We are a newly <br/>
formed group for unschoolers and radical unschoolers in the <br/>
south/southwestern Idaho area.  All are welcome & thanks Ren for <br/>
letting us tell about ourselves here!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks & Merry Day to all the fathers!<br/>
