Wendy,<br/>
 <br/>
We don&#39;t tend to work with hypotheticals here. Real life examples are best.  <br/>
Stating a problem you&#39;re dealing with and asking how we&#39;ve dealt with a <br/>
similar  situation gives us a place to jump off from.<br/>
 <br/>
BUT----in this instance, I actually have an example I can share.<br/>
 <br/>
Many people would think of alcohol/marijuana use as &quot;disruptive,  <br/>
destructive, or dangerous&quot;. I have a sixteen year old son and am in the midst of  this.<br/>
 <br/>
As a teen/young adult. I spent a lot of time drinking---and fairly  <br/>
irresponsibly. But shooting up, snorting something up my nose, popping  pills, or <br/>
smoking anything was *never* attractive to me. But I have a son  who likes pot.<br/>
 <br/>
My options: <br/>
1) I could yell and scream and forbid weed in *my* house. <br/>
 <br/>
2) I could ignore the whole thing----pretend it&#39;s not happening.<br/>
 <br/>
3) I could turn him in to the cops.<br/>
 <br/>
4) I could support his &quot;habit&quot;----make it out to be peachy-keen and even  buy <br/>
it for him.<br/>
 <br/>
5) I could probably do several other things-----but what I&#39;ve chosen to do  <br/>
is to tell him how I feel about it. Ask him to make wise choices about its  <br/>
purchase and use. Asked him not to smoke in the house or in a car----OR  anywhere <br/>
he might get caught. To please keep it away from his brother. And it IS  <br/>
illegal----he could go to jail for posession.<br/>
 <br/>
He has friends who are &quot;pot-heads&quot;----who will smoke whatever they can get  <br/>
their paws on, and stay high most of the time. Their parents have banned pot <br/>
and  refuse to talk about it except for the command, &quot;Don&#39;t smoke pot.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
So.....Cameron smokes. Not in the house, but in the garage. He doesn&#39;t  drive <br/>
when or after smoking. He doesn&#39;t allow his friends to drive after smoking  <br/>
either (They&#39;ll go get their &quot;munchies&quot; *before* they get high.).<br/>
 <br/>
He&#39;s responsible with it. Buys &quot;organic&quot; from people he trusts. Keeps it  <br/>
away from his little brother (and me! &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
 <br/>
He attends NORML meetings (although I&#39;ve suggested NOT to sign anything  <br/>
there! &lt;g&gt;) and thinks it should be legalized (in fact, he&#39;s read----and  picked <br/>
apart--- the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and several laws to  find out <br/>
more about it). <br/>
 <br/>
He&#39;s agreeable to taxing it, if it were made legal.<br/>
 <br/>
He knows all about the history of hemp and marijuana and the  reasons it was <br/>
banned/made illegal----big business of the 30&#39;s and 40&#39;s and the  invention of <br/>
polyesters.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;ve talked about it a great deal. I give him my views----and he does some  <br/>
research and often opens my eyes to new thinking. I&#39;m still not wild about it, <br/>
 but I feel he&#39;s using it responsibly (ugh!)----and will not abuse it.<br/>
 <br/>
Do I wish he wouldn&#39;t use it at all? Uh huh. But I&#39;d rather that he be  <br/>
comfortable talking about it and using it responsibly than sneaking around and  <br/>
hiding it because I&#39;d forbidden it.<br/>
 <br/>
Issues like this are waaaay harder to handle than drawing on the dining  room <br/>
table! &lt;g&gt; But if a child has always felt listened to and respected  and <br/>
trusted, he&#39;s more likely to share his concerns with you----even illegal  <br/>
ones!---and let you be a part of his life, even as a teen/young adult!<br/>

 <br/>
Because he doesn&#39;t HAVE to! Many children DON&#39;T! I feel very lucky that we  <br/>
have the kind of relationship that allows this sharing!<br/>

Just that point----he doesn&#39;t HAVE to let me be a part of his life. He  <br/>

   Are you willing to go to jail for your sons choices?  In Vt if you allow<br/>

 </span></blockquote>i whole heartedly agree.one of my older two kids,just told mehe had tried <br/>
pot,,hes 18,was 17 when he done it ,,i cant fathom at 18 telling my mom i had <br/>
smoked pot.so i guess im doing something right somewhere.its hard at times,not to <br/>
get upset  when they tell me things they have done,,,but ,,they are young men <br/>
now,,,,im just thankfull they trust me enough to talk openly about things <br/>
,,,god only knows,,and im sure some other parents here can agree,,my growing up <br/>
years were not with openess with my mom..that didnt come till i was much older <br/>
and had a couple of kids of my own,,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-949422131">Do I wish he wouldn&#39;t use it at all? Uh huh. But I&#39;d rather that he be<br/>
  comfortable talking about it and using it responsibly than sneaking around<br/>
and<br/>
  hiding it because I&#39;d forbidden it.<br/>
<br/>
 When I was bout 15 my mom found out that I was smoking pot, instead of yelling and screaming at me, we started talking about it. She shared her fears about me smoking(she also smoked it, I found out). She was afraid of me and my friends driving while stoned (we were) buying frome people we didn&#39;t know (we were) having it on us while out and smoking in public (we were). She was willing to provide me and my friends a safe environment, if we could behave responsably and not do the things that were causing her to worry and be scared. <br/>
<br/>
It was great, I did what I needed to do with pot, and because of the repect my mom gave me and those &quot;parental reprocussions&quot; were gone. It was over with and out of my system in a much shorter period of thime than if it had been a power struggle. <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunatly, my dad was not as open with me and my time living with him led me down a much darker path that took a while to recover from. <br/>
<br/>
Jason and I both feel that if and when our kids decide that they are ready to try experimenting we would rather do as my mom did and provide a safe space for them. We look at it as all other &quot;learning experiences&quot; it&#39;s better with a safty net; of love, trust and respect. I would rather thaem be in my home where I can help with any problems that may arise, than them in a back alley or in a strangers car where no help may be avalible to them if they should need it.<br/>
<br/>
I may not have said this to clearly, it&#39;s been a rough day, and I&#39;m trying to catch a few mins here and there in between meltdowns and crisises<br/>
