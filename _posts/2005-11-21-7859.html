<div id="ygrps-yiv-225687005">Hello all<br/>
My name is Allan, and I&#39;m an unschooler. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I am a single parent, homeschooling two boys ages 13 and 18 right now, and<br/>
within two weeks my daughters ages 12 and 17 will be here and join the<br/>
unschooling team. I only recently arranged for my children&#39;s escape from the<br/>
penal system we call publik school, and we are all the better for it.<br/>
Everyone&#39;s attitude and behavior have undergone a remarkable transformation.<br/>
Not that I would have said it was &#39;bad&#39; before, but thats only because I<br/>
didn&#39;t know what &#39;good&#39; was.<br/>
<br/>
The day before I broke them out of the pen, I bought a few books to use as<br/>
our curriculum; a pre-Algebra book, a grammar book, a daily reader on Texas<br/>
history, and because we already had a Biology text book, teachers, edition,<br/>
I thought I had it covered, should anyone say anything.<br/>
<br/>
I had been researching home schooling as an option because of the typical<br/>
things that one endures while their children are incarcerated from 8:00-3:45<br/>
PM in the schooljailhouse, e.g. defending against bullying, boredom with the<br/>
necessary-but-snail&#39;s pace of &#39;learning&#39; in the class room, arrogant wardens<br/>
and guards.. er, I mean principals and teachers, anyway you know what I<br/>
mean. I came across a few unschooling sites and the dam burst. I KNEW right<br/>
away that this was the method I wanted to use with my children.<br/>
<br/>
But... I bought my &#39;textbooks&#39; just in case someone questioned me. I worried<br/>
for awhile that they would get &#39;behind&#39;, although now I think of it as,<br/>
&#39;behind what, exactly?&#39; Because I have already in just a short couple of<br/>
weeks, watched my boys interests grow exponentially. I discussed the idea of<br/>
unschooling with them, told them what was involved and, to the best of my<br/>
understanding, what it would and would not entail. And of course they loved<br/>
the idea. :-)<br/>
<br/>
When my oldest two children were very young, I was quite the disciplinarian.<br/>
I didn&#39;t want the boys to cry, you always had to do what the teacher said,<br/>
yada yada yada. I was a military man as well as a law enforcement officer.<br/>
You did what was expected of you, to the best of your ability.<br/>
<br/>
How I wish I had those years back. I tell my children now that my youngest<br/>
two have benefited so much from my experiences with my eldest. I have told<br/>
my kids that I regret those days and wish I could turn back the clock and be<br/>
their guide and mentor instead of their lord and taskmaster. But you can<br/>
only do what you can do, and, thankfully, I have a wonderful relationship<br/>
with all four of my kids today.<br/>
<br/>
What prompted me to write an intro, finally, was reading the discussions<br/>
between a few of the members here who are having trouble dealing with<br/>
recalcitrant husbands. Those who sound a lot like I was, a long time ago. :D<br/>
I find this exchange fascinating, because over the past few years I have<br/>
found that I, the male father figure, am the one who has been more lenient.<br/>
I am the one who didn&#39;t want to enforce bedtimes, saying, they will learn<br/>
they need to get up when they are tired all day the next day. I didn&#39;t want<br/>
to enforce certain mealtimes nor did I mind if someone wasn&#39;t hungry<br/>
(although I admit I enjoyed dinners when we were all together). I would<br/>
NEVER make a child clean his plate of food; I hated that when I was a child<br/>
and I hate it today. I was the one who was lenient in style of dress,<br/>
hairstyles, music, movies, you name it.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t get me wrong, I did try to &#39;enforce&#39; certain rules when I felt that it<br/>
would bring negative or unwanted attention upon ME, but over time I learned<br/>
not to worry about those things, either. I have found that setting a good<br/>
example is the best teacher of all. If you want your children to be polite<br/>
to others, then thank the cashier and the waitress in front of them. Smile<br/>
at people and engage them in conversation. Return lost items. Simple,<br/>
really.<br/>
<br/>
As for learning and &quot;teaching&quot; things, I have always handled (well always is<br/>
a big word, but in general), I have always tried to explain, to the best of<br/>
my ability, the answer to a question posed by one of my children. I remember<br/>
trying to explain the way a clutch and transmission work when my son, who<br/>
was six or seven at the time, asked me why I had to shift gears while<br/>
driving. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I find now that my sons&#39; knowledge far surpasses mine in many areas. My 13<br/>
year old is a self-taught web designer, and is working his way through a<br/>
manual on programming in C++. Trust me, he didn&#39;t learn this in junior high<br/>
jail. My 18 year old is a history and mythology buff. He can rattle off so<br/>
much ancient history it is hard to keep up. And again, you can believe me<br/>
when I say that he was *not* taught that in high school. I&#39;m waiting for my<br/>
girls to arrive. I think they are nervous about being &#39;home skooled&#39;, but I<br/>
truly believe when they find out they can read watch talk learn about<br/>
whatever THEY want, they will be happy to have moved here.<br/>
<br/>
To those wives who are struggling to unschool with traditional dads, may I<br/>
suggest something? As a man, and hopefully, understanding the way men think,<br/>
I always wanted my children to be independent and think for themselves (yes,<br/>
even though I would chastise them for being independent of what I thought<br/>
:grin: ) So perhaps one way you might begin to sublty influence your<br/>
husbands to come to the &#39;dark side&#39; is to illuminate how independent little<br/>
Johnny or Jane is, since you&#39;ve been unschooling. Introduce into the<br/>
conversation that the child was so interested in this certain topic, ALL ON<br/>
HIS OWN. Tell hubby how great it is that Jane picks out her own clothes,<br/>
puts on her own shoes, decides on her own what she wants to eat, etc. &quot;This<br/>
girl will be a real LEADER some day! She won&#39;t let anybody pull her around<br/>
by the nose! She&#39;s a thinker, she knows what she wants. I bet that she gets<br/>
it from you, Dear!&quot; :wink wink:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-503086167">Good insight. Thanks Allan.<br/>
<br/>
I also wanted to mention that i know moms who had recalcitrant  <br/>
husbands and they had &quot;homeschool time&quot; every day, but it was always  <br/>
fun stuff that the kids decided on. Mom and kids would brainstorm  <br/>
topics and activities to do during &quot;homeschool time.&quot; Sometimes it  <br/>
would be a topic like &quot;weather&quot; and mom would gather fun/interesting  <br/>
stuff related to that topic - movie from the library, a home weather  <br/>
station, etc. Mom would always keep the kids interests in mind -  <br/>
hands-on activities that the kids would enjoy, for example. The kids  <br/>
NEVER had to do it if they didn&#39;t feel like it - so it was mom&#39;s  <br/>
challenge to make it fun enough to entice them. Other times it would  <br/>
be a certain game they all wanted to play or a time to do art stuff  <br/>
or listen to a book on tape.  The husbands seemed to be satisfied by  <br/>
the existence of &quot;homeschool time&quot; each day - even though it didn&#39;t  <br/>
look like conventional school with workbooks, etc. The kids liked  <br/>
that dedicated time - mom not distracted b anything else and the moms  <br/>
were really good at coming up with things to do that the kids really  <br/>
did enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t unschooling but it is a lot better than regular school-at- <br/>
home and a good transition TO unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2029943011">This is such a good suggestion from Pam.  I think there is a tendency to try<br/>
to say well I can&#39;t unschool because DH doesn&#39;t get it or worse even, to get<br/>
angry or impatient with a husband who is still on the beginning of the<br/>
learning curve.  Wrecking that relationship does nothing to help the kids.<br/>
KWIM?   My husband is soooo patient and trusting of what I want to<br/>
accomplish with the kids.  But at times when he has been wanting something<br/>
to change, I need to get to the root of what he really wants and brain storm<br/>
with him about how we might accomplish that.  (it&#39;s not always as peaceful<br/>
as that sounds LOL)  Recently, he started talking about getting them to go<br/>
to bed earlier and &quot;Do they really have to watch that much TV?&quot;  Well, my<br/>
hackles went up about limits and respecting their rhythms etc. but when we<br/>
got to the bottom of it he really just wanted more time to interact with<br/>
them without them saying &quot;I&#39;m watching this show&quot; or whatever.  His schedule<br/>
after all is much more limited by work (what a guy as Sandra says) than<br/>
theirs is.  <br/>
<br/>
So, to shorten this long story, we decided (discussed, it with the kids<br/>
etc.) that we could all - including dh- leave our individual pursuits at 8pm<br/>
and get together to do something together.  This would not have occurred to<br/>
me bc I see the kids all day every day but he doesn&#39;t and we decided that 8<br/>
to whenever was a good time for us to connect as a family.  10yo Sydney took<br/>
that idea and ran with it.  She organized movie night, &quot;family fun night&quot;<br/>
and Saturday breakfast which she and dad cook togethter.  After bkfst we<br/>
talk about (well actually it is more like a detailed family meeting) what<br/>
movies to put on the Netflix list for movie night and what games we want to<br/>
play for family fun night, vacation plans and any other business people<br/>
bring up.  Hubby is happy with all the involvement and the kids are way<br/>
happy to have more of his energy in the mix of our busy lives.<br/>
<br/>
The kids don&#39;t see it as an imposition, (though there is sometimes some<br/>
complaining at the moment when it&#39;s time to leave off what they&#39;re doing.)<br/>
They understand that the bit of structure helps us meet one of our needs<br/>
(Dad&#39;s) and we try to meet all of everyone&#39;s needs here.  <br/>
<br/>
I know this isn&#39;t the same as &quot;homeschool time&quot; as it was put forth on this<br/>
thread but the same kind of approach would work for that as well as other<br/>
concerns dads have that threaten to derail unschooling or cause tention<br/>
between the parents.  Having a peaceful happy family where everybody cares<br/>
about each other is the biggest reason I wanted to unschool in the first<br/>
place.<br/>
