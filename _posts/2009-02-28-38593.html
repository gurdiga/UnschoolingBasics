<div id="ygrps-yiv-1904390731">I just want to make it very clear that I never said I hated graphic novels<br/>
or comic books or any other kind of book.  I did not wish to start a huge<br/>
debate.  I was simply looking for some answers and reassurance that what my<br/>
son chooses to read is either a) okay and that I need to further work on<br/>
letting go; or b) that I should  burn every graphic novel he comes into<br/>
contact with and force him to read classic novels (that was a joke!!  Please<br/>
don&#39;t think I would EVER do something like that!).<br/>
<br/>
It has been great to listen to everyone&#39;s opinions and I have truly<br/>
benefited from this conversation.  I even led my son to the graphic novel<br/>
section of the library the other day and let him loose.  As I said before,<br/>
everyone is at a different place on their journey and everyone has different<br/>
comfort zones.  I am being challenged to expand my zone and I appreciate<br/>
that.  Thank you for all your responses.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>
Betsie<br/>

<br/>
Don&#39;t feel responsible if a big debate ensues.:) Lists are funny like <br/>
that...none of us can predict how other&#39;s will respond to our <br/>
questions or stories and other people benefit from the <br/>
discussion/debate many times who didn&#39;t even chime in.<br/>
<br/>
Back to the person who does hate graphic novels:<br/>
&quot; I hate graphic books. I don&#39;t think they are the best choice for<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; reading.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt; I think they totally squash the imagination.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think unschooling flourishes with open minded adults nearby. I <br/>
think it blossoms when people are willing and able to lay their own <br/>
prejudices aside and see EVERYTHING as learning. Everything. Learning <br/>
happens because we&#39;re alive. It happens becuase we get excited about <br/>
something or interested in a thing.<br/>
<br/>
If someone loves graphic novels, you will not change their minds <br/>
about it by hating them. You will cause them to trust you less with <br/>
their desires and passions.<br/>
<br/>
I was very fortunate to have a mother who did not censor our reading. <br/>
Ever. She bought wads of comic books my entire life and continued <br/>
buying them when I had children of my own. She knew literature inside <br/>
and out. But her favorite was children and young adult stories. She <br/>
became a children&#39;s librarian she loved them so much and shared that <br/>
passion and joy by running storytelling and reading programs for <br/>
years.<br/>
<br/>
She bought my children an amazing collection of children&#39;s stories <br/>
(which are a form of graphic books) and we continue to enjoy and read <br/>
them today. I LOVE stories that include art. When should I give this <br/>
up? I&#39;m almost 40.<br/>
<br/>
Graphic novels themselves have an amazing amount of intelligent <br/>
writing and art in them. It&#39;s pure snobbery to look at them as &quot;low <br/>
art&quot;...but common. I love this discussion about it between Calvin and <br/>
Hobbes:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/bfgdwb">http://tinyurl.com/bfgdwb</a><br/>
<br/>
As unschoolers, we need to be open to whatever our children love. <br/>
Because when you &quot;hate&quot; something your child loves, it hurts them.<br/>
Hurting children is not the goal of unschooling. <br/>
