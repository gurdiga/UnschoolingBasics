free, dairy (and casein free), and soy free diet (as<br/>
well as potato and artificial colors and flavors). It<br/>
will take your child&#39;s gut a while to heal, so while<br/>
you might see almost overnight changes, it will be a<br/>
while before things will be &quot;normal&quot; inside his body.<br/>

Feel free to email me with questions about the diet,<br/>

Good for you, btw, for doing this for your child. You<br/>
wouldn&#39;t believe how many parents I&#39;ve talked to<br/>
suspect their child has food allergies, but don&#39;t want<br/>
to be inconvienced into changing their fast food lives.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-499400126">My three year old has it, and possibly the older ones as well. With Dan there wasn&#39;t too <br/>
much in signs, he also reacted with shock when first exposed so he never had a large <br/>
infraction. Now that he&#39;s older and choosing to eat foods that have wheat, we have noticed <br/>
that he tends to be more rigid about &#39;rules&#39; (like we can&#39;t change a word in a song without <br/>
a fast and furious meltdown) and needful of us. From what I&#39;ve read (all in relation to <br/>
autism) is that it can take months for all the wheat to flush from the system and for the <br/>
intestines to start to heal.<br/>
Based on Dan&#39;s reaction to wheat infractions, we were going to try a wheat-free family all <br/>
summer, but Josh has told us he&#39;d rather be dead ;-) It is hard for older children to adjust <br/>
to, many of the foods are just not good replacements. Scott&#39;s celiac newsletter is a good <br/>
one, it doesn&#39;t just talk about food, but also toiletries, toys, etc that cause reactions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1348729045">Hi Cara,<br/>
<br/>
Ds 7 and I both have celiac.  We were diagnosed 2 years ago and life is <br/>
a lot better now.  Being sick and feeling bad just sucks!  We feel <br/>
really lucky that it&#39;s just celiac -- changing our diet as opposed to <br/>
taking medications with side effects is a blessing.  Not too many <br/>
diseases out there can be completely controlled and damage cured just <br/>
by cutting gluten out of the diet.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of support groups for kids with celiac and allergies.  <br/>
Please note that celiac disease is not an allergy and is not tested as <br/>
one.  Check with your GI&#39;s office and they should be able to refer you <br/>
to resources.  The main hurdle is educating yourself on reading labels <br/>
and knowing how to be food safe smart.  The <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.glutenfreeforum.com">http://www.glutenfreeforum.com</a> website is great for finding information <br/>
to anything remotely related to celiac.  <br/>
<br/>
I would not associate &quot;behavior&quot; with celiac.  If celiac is the problem <br/>
it&#39;s not going to be diagnosed on behavior but on the condition of his <br/>
gut.  Sometimes a gluten-free diet has been shown to help behavior <br/>
issues in some people, but that is not usually the case.  Diet can and <br/>
does affect many of the ways our bodies function.  But if you&#39;re <br/>
looking to &quot;cure&quot; behavior issues by controlling your child&#39;s food you <br/>
may be in for more power struggles than cures.  I have an &quot;intense&quot; <br/>
child -- going gluten free healed his gut.<br/>
<br/>
All the best in finding healing for your child,<br/>
Linda<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1752250607">Yes, gluten takes 8-9 months to fully leave the<br/>
body... dairy takes 2 weeks.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so thankful my son adapted well to his diet. He<br/>
never asks for what he knows he can&#39;t have... I&#39;ve<br/>
heard some real horror stories. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-467388117">Thanks for the support!<br/>
That is a long list of foods to exclude, did you have the testing done<br/>
for celiac, the tTG blood test or some allergy testing? We also<br/>
suspect blue food colouring plays havoc with his mood, since we don&#39;t<br/>
buy foods like that at home the few times he drank blue stuff at a<br/>
friends house he had a complete meltdown when he got home.<br/>
<br/>
Its a challenge now to think about such a strict set of dietary rules<br/>
in an unschooling family, how do you manage that? and do you have<br/>
other children not on this diet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-478366564">The short version of the story goes... my son was<br/>
diagnosed autistic at age 5. I knew something was<br/>
wrong far earlier, but the ped neurologist had told me<br/>
my son would &quot;grow out of it.&quot; Autism was never<br/>
mentioned.<br/>
<br/>
After he was diagnosed, the doctor felt putting my son<br/>
on ritalin would be good. It wasn&#39;t... quite the<br/>
opposite. When ritalin didn&#39;t work, the doctor just<br/>
wanted to keep trying med after med after med. I<br/>
decided my son wasn&#39;t going to be a guinea pig and<br/>
that I would seek out an option that was healthy, not<br/>
harmful. I discovered the GFCF diet.<br/>
<br/>
We never had my son tested, per se. We removed certain<br/>
foods for a test period. Then allow an &quot;infraction&quot;<br/>
and watch him to see if there was a reaction. Gluten<br/>
made him react with autistic behaviors, as well as<br/>
potato. Soy makes him super-hyper. Diary makes him<br/>
sick to his stomach. No one needs artificial colors<br/>
and flavors, so I never bothered to &quot;test&quot; that.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, my younger son is not on the GFCF diet, neither<br/>
my husband or myself. My autistic son never complains<br/>
about what he can&#39;t eat. I try to explain to him that<br/>
it will make him sick to eat these foods. Then I make<br/>
foods for him that are as close to normal as I can get<br/>
them. Pancakes, blueberry muffins, flour tortillas,<br/>
hot pretzels, etc. And I grill a lot too... shish<br/>
kabobs, garlic chicken, pork chops. Plus he loves<br/>
fresh fruit and veggies. He eats far healthier than<br/>
anyone else in my house, and he honestly doesn&#39;t even<br/>
like cookies, brownies, cake, or even chocolate.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to say that he knows that the<br/>
gluten/dairy/etc make him feel sick, but with his<br/>
autism, it&#39;s hard for him to tell me things like that.<br/>
I try to let him be as free as he can be within his<br/>
diet. And as I said, he&#39;s adapted very well and really<br/>
never asks for anything he can&#39;t have. I&#39;ve been most<br/>
fortunate. :)<br/>
