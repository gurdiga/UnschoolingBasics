I  believe in radical unschooling, it works quite well for most of my kids <br/>
but  Zach is 12 now and I still haven&#39;t figured out a way to make unschooling <br/>
and  sugar go hand in hand for him.<br/>

I keep coming back to this thought.....know your child!<br/>
 <br/>
My kids are very self-limiting when it comes to food choices.  Now,  they <br/>
don&#39;t tend to eat candy until it makes them sick, but they would still  choose <br/>
candy over edamame or celery every time.  Sometimes my kids get  hungry, and <br/>
they can&#39;t figure out what to eat because nothing sounds good and  they are tired <br/>
of the same things.<br/>
 <br/>
By the way, I am researching enzymes.  My kids have always had tummy  <br/>
troubles and food issues, even while exclusively nursing.  I&#39;ve noticed  lately that <br/>
they are limiting themselves more and more.  They used to be on  enzymes a <br/>
couple of years ago, but we moved away from the chiropractor that sold  them to <br/>
us.  The other day I was thinking that the food issue was not as  big a deal <br/>
when we lived in our previous home and I remembered the  enzymes!<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ll post my findings in December, Julie! <br/>
