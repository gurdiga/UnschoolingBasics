ah, more defensive nit-picking. Now tell me, does that look to you<br/>
like a typo or does it look like a spelling mistake? I am talking<br/>
about people who would write confedance and feel like it doesn&#39;t make<br/>
a difference :)<br/>
<br/>
But tell you what :) it has been gently brought to my attention that<br/>
Google *does* have a spellcheck, which I had overlooked. Since my<br/>
typos offend you, if and when I post here again, I&#39;ll be sure to run<br/>
it just for you :)<br/>

<br/>
I am so confused!  Aren&#39;t YOU the one who complained first about this?  YOU <br/>
are the one who brought it up!  We can&#39;t help it if you are also guilty of what <br/>
you were complaining about! <br/>
<br/>
Also...seems to me you had a similar &#39;problem&#39; on Anne O&#39;s shining <br/>
unschooling list a few weeks back...?  You also mentioned a &#39;disagreement&#39; on what <br/>
sounded like unschooling discussion list.  Maybe you just like to stir things up?  <br/>
Maybe you should think about why you like to join unschooling lists and then <br/>
complain about unschoolers?<br/>

Ren and Kelly only started this list a few months ago. Perhaps you are<br/>
mixing your lists. <br/>

No, but there IS spellcheck for those who are uptight about spelling  errors.<br/>
 <br/>
The rest of us will gloss over it, not worry, and not point out the  weakness.<br/>
