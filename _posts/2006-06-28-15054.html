<div id="ygrps-yiv-2916253">A quick pop in to say THANK YOU SO MUCH for all of the *amazing* <br/>
replies!!!  I have SO much to think about and it&#39;s just so very <br/>
exciting.  I&#39;ve used the advice and stories with my family and have <br/>
had such heartwarming results!!!  It feels really good to be working <br/>
so incredibly hard, but having moments of beauty and flow and pureness <br/>
of love and connection with my kids.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m working on another question revolving around chucking bed time, <br/>
which we&#39;re trying to do but having some trouble with boundaries and <br/>
balancing it with DH and my desire to have time to connect, just the <br/>
two of us.  BUT, I&#39;m not really ready for that conversation yet...I&#39;m <br/>
still processing and incorporating so many other principles.  I <br/>
repeat...I have NOT asked the question yet, lmao!  I guess I&#39;m just <br/>
warning you that I&#39;ll be back with a question about that when I feel <br/>
the inklings of being ready for the replies, strategies, comfort-zone <br/>
stretching.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime we&#39;ll work with these new changes and enjoy!!!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I have *got* to get to bed, but wanted to let you know what a <br/>
valuable contribution you all made for me ;-)  And that I really <br/>
appreciate your generous replies!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You don&#39;t have to chuck bed time, you can just be more<br/>
relaxed about it. Like let the kids finish whatever<br/>
they&#39;re doing. Say &quot;yes&quot; when they want one more book<br/>
- that sort of thing. Follow their clues instead of<br/>
the clock. Also I think it&#39;s fine to say you&#39;re tired<br/>
and need some quiet time.<br/>
