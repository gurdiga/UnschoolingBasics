<div id="ygrps-yiv-789903584">I too have faith that he will moderate, will become interested in other things; he is very creative... it does help to know that others with this pattern seem to move out of it.<br/>
<br/>
It is just hard to watch....I found it hard; but on the other hand it constantly made me question my own boundaries and my entire belief system about so many things, including the whole idea of what learning is.  I think this group has made me question many things...<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and we had a long talk about the nature of homeschooling, what he would like to pursue this semester, what he liked and did not like about last semester.  He felt bad about depriving me of his company during his WOW marathon and vowed that he would become more balanced.  And it has been happening!  Today we are visiting a glass blowing center nearby, and he wants to pursue blacksmithing and will take a workshop at the end of the month.<br/>

As someone who has come to this recently too, and pulling a child <br/>
from school, it IS harder.  Don&#39;t expect things to change <br/>
overnight!   I have struggled with the changes in myself (it&#39;s easier <br/>
for her!).  And even more so if you&#39;ve been a teacher or involved in <br/>
school systems, as I know you have 8-).<br/>
<br/>
Honest and respectful communication is what works best for us.  We <br/>
have to work on it all the time, not in a negative way, but in a <br/>
mindful, &quot;in the moment&quot; way.   It&#39;s not perfect, but much better <br/>
than the alternative.   Keep reading and absorbing.   No matter what, <br/>
you need to take what works best for you and your son!   No one will <br/>
fault you for that!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1085986183">~~No matter what,<br/>

<br/>
This phrase gets used a lot and sometimes means: do what works best<br/>
for the adults in the house. <br/>
<br/>
I think parents really need to examine their own issues with video<br/>
games before imposing arbitrary limits on their children. Embracing<br/>
the interest goes a lot further to facilitating trust, than trying to<br/>
limit what a child loves. &quot;What works&quot; for some families is hitting,<br/>
yelling, limiting and controlling. I think &quot;what works&quot; best for<br/>
unschoolers is trust, respect and joy. <br/>

I wrote that and didn&#39;t specifically mean just video games etc, I was <br/>
thinking more in terms of the journey and transition to unschooling.  <br/>
It&#39;s a process.  I agree there&#39;s a lot that needs to be examined as <br/>
adults as far as video gaming goes and I was trying to stress honesty <br/>
and respect, something that more &quot;traditional&quot; parents struggle with, <br/>
especially with teens, and especially when coming to unschooling later <br/>
on with a teen and one who has been in school.<br/>
