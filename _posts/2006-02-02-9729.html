<div id="ygrps-yiv-1231120606">That is what I have done like I have tried to explain and I blame myself for<br/>
not being plainer... It has been a step-by-step process. He has always been<br/>
interested in what anyone is doing. Me, his father, his Nana or when I take<br/>
him to where his Aunt lives (at an Intentional Community called Wygelia) and<br/>
I have dealt with my battles of he is not too young to help and turn it<br/>
around to in what way, no matter the task can he help.<br/>
<br/>
He even helps someone build a fire by carrying fire wood (one piece at a<br/>
time), looking for kindling and blowing on the spark. While I do admit that<br/>
some times I make it sound that a lot of it comes from me. His desire to<br/>
help has built over time to him doing these things. I didn&#39;t just throw<br/>
detergent at him and tell him to go clean the mess up.<br/>
<br/>
It is the same steps to clean anything up from toys to a building project.<br/>
If he says a job is too big then we break it down together. We pick the big<br/>
pieces first, the smaller pieces next, wipe up or vacuum whatever is left<br/>
behind. It has slowly over a very long time to get to the point of him doing<br/>
these things on him own.<br/>
<br/>
He likes to help out and he likes almost any job that he can play in water;<br/>
washing the dishes, spot treating laundry and cleaning the floor. Does he do<br/>
it all the time? No! He does it when it strikes him to do it or a big mess<br/>
is made or he finds himself washing his hands at the sink and sees that<br/>
there are a couple things in the prespot bucket that we moved upstairs<br/>
because he expressed wanting to do it and it has made it more convenient for<br/>
us all because I will do one when I am washing my hands or my husband will<br/>
and me doing will spike his interest - &quot;But Mama I wanted to do those!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
None of us have a chore list. We all do whatever needs done as it needs done<br/>
when it needs done. Sometimes it does get forgotten and eventually we may<br/>
need a better method. I don&#39;t expect him to do more then he expects of<br/>
himself. When he was very young it was Opps! You spilled some milk or<br/>
whatever. Let&#39;s clean it up! Messes don&#39;t bother me - except vomit which I<br/>
just can&#39;t do. Thank goodness for my husband! <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-357306452">Shannon, What do you mean by misbehaving?  How old is your child?  <br/>
<br/>
My children never &quot;misbehave.&quot;  They behave according to their desires, motivation, needs, curiosity, explorations, understanding (or naivety) and the responses they get.  <br/>
<br/>
For instance, when one child used to write on walls, i was quick to give her paper to write on indicating that these walls weren&#39;t for writing on.  I did put up paper on the walls so that she could write on the walls without ruining the paint.<br/>
<br/>
Or - if you are referring to inappropriate social interactions i have done my best not to put my child in a situation they are not developmentally ready for, or at the very least prepare them for what is expected of them (eg. quiet in the library).  But if when my young child was biting or hitting or yelling at another, it was usually because the situation was not the right one for my child and/or they were not being respected.<br/>
<br/>
When my younger dd was 5yo she went under a table at a restaurant with my mom and wouldn&#39;t come out.  Drove my mom crazy.  But bottom line, my mom was driving my dd crazy because she was not respecting my dd when dd said &quot;no&quot; to sharing her food, and my mom took food anyway.  Did mom apologize for &quot;misbehaving?&quot; No.  She shamed my dd by calling her selfish and silly, my dd then used the only means available to her to have some power in the situation.  Had i been there I might have been able to intervene on my dd&#39;s behalf.  But i wasn&#39;t.  My dd has not been left with my mom since.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never found my child to &quot;misbehave&quot; with intention of hurting or damaging another person or object without provocation.  Perhaps your child is unaware of the social convention or expectations and then it&#39;s not a behavior that needs punishment (or rewards) just information.<br/>
