unschooling.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1928374133">One day isn&#39;t a lot of time to explore Montreal &lt;g&gt;, but here are a  <br/>
few highlights for me:<br/>
<br/>
Schwartz&#39;s Deli for a famous Montreal Smoked Meat Sandwich (apologies  <br/>
for recommending this if you are a vegetarian &lt;g&gt;). It&#39;s on St.  <br/>
Laurent Blvd. and every cabbie would know where it is.<br/>

<br/>
If you like cathedrals, see Cath√©drale Marie-Reine-du-Monde (Mary  <br/>
Queen of the World) in downtown Montreal (nice park right there,  <br/>
too).  Amazing architecture and statuary.<br/>

<br/>
You shouldn&#39;t miss Vieux Montreal (Old Montreal) - it&#39;s beautiful and  <br/>
funky, with amazing old architecture (actually a lot of the city has  <br/>
that). Lots of cool shops and restaurants. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.vieux.montreal.qc.ca/eng/accueila.htm">http://www.vieux.montreal.qc.ca/eng/accueila.htm</a><br/>

<br/>
The park at Mount Royal (Mont-Royal) is very nice, but if you don&#39;t  <br/>
get to it, you can look up at night to see the large illuminated cross  <br/>
at the top.<br/>

<br/>
If you want to see one of the last two in-use pavilions from Expo 67,  <br/>
go to Ile Ste. Helene to see Biosphere, which was the U.S. pavilion,  <br/>
designed by Buckminster Fuller.<br/>

<br/>
Some background on the World&#39;s Fair in 1967:<br/>

<br/>
The Montreal Tourism site has a 2 minute video that might give you  <br/>
some more ideas (and links to where things are and what to do).<br/>

<br/>
FYI, Montreal drivers are great, but aggressive. And so are the  <br/>
pedestrians! When you are at a curb, waiting to cross, just go with  <br/>
the rest of the pedestrians, even if the lights haven&#39;t turned in your  <br/>
favour.  The good thing about this is that everyone, drivers and  <br/>
pedestrians, is paying attention. I&#39;ve heard, though, that the Surete  <br/>
(police) are cracking down, so it may not be the &quot;take your life in  <br/>
your hands&quot; funfest it used to be!<br/>
<br/>
(FWIW, my dh says just skip Montreal and go to Quebec City, but he&#39;s  <br/>
biased towards fortifications and historical aspects &lt;g&gt;. He says  <br/>
there are lots of big cities like Montreal, but none in North America  <br/>
like Quebec City. He&#39;s probably right, but I don&#39;t know if you have  <br/>
enough time, this trip, to do that. For me, I&#39;m still surprised that  <br/>
after living most of my young life in Ottawa, ON, I never made it to  <br/>
Quebec City. It&#39;s one of the places on my &quot;bucket list.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
HTH and bonne vacances,<br/>
