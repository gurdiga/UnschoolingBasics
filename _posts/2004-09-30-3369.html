<div id="ygrps-yiv-451993861">Hello ladies,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have had not a new experience but am more articulate about it this time<br/>
rather than just emotional. But even so I am wondering if anyone can share<br/>
with me their feelings/thoughts or literature about what the result of<br/>
blaming and shaming on people (not just children) is? What does it<br/>
accomplish and what do the people who do it hope to accomplish? And if, in<br/>
the past someone has had a blaming attitude at times, how would they go<br/>
about getting rid of that, even with the knowledge that the person being<br/>
blamed feels horrible it can be hard.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Also, how can someone go about developing more patience in their life and<br/>
more gentleness in their communications with others?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Just a few small topics for 8 am in the morning, but this unschooling thing<br/>
is making me think about all this and where better to come for answer than<br/>
to the people causing me to think:-)<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-852977796">Hi Sherrie,<br/>
<br/>
The blaming, lack of patience, etc., are simply thought patterns that have become habit.  When someone finds themselves thinking that way it is often helpful to say outoud &quot;stop&quot;, back up and try again.<br/>
<br/>
To develop patience, I always suggest that people take up a hobby that involves some kind of physical skill, like karate or hip-hop dancing.  Ask the kids if they want to take the class with you.  At least make sure that they see you practicing, succeeding, failing.  It reinforces for you how you can have the best of intentions and still not get it right.<br/>
<br/>
Meditation is a wonderful thing as well.<br/>

by Marshall B. Rosenberg, Ph.D. I got it at our the library.  To read move<br/>
about NVC in general see www.cnvc.org<br/>

The book is gentle, eye opening, and gives extremely practical advice for<br/>
how to modify our communication to help us be more happy and fulfilled<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-573685015">Hi Rachel,<br/>
<br/>
I have read the book already, I found it to be intriguing in theory but<br/>
clumsy and awkward feeling in practice. Perhaps it was just my need to use<br/>
it more to get more comfortable with it. I just felt very artificial saying<br/>
some of the things the way it was suggested.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I will give it another look,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-56748401">I&#39;ve read about it in anger management books and have changed my own <br/>
attitude quite a bit. I don&#39;t have time today to share about my take, <br/>
but I googled &#39;anger management&#39; and &#39;blame&#39; and here&#39;s one article <br/>
that is a good intro, with a quote that explains the relationship btn <br/>
anger and blame:<br/>
<br/>
&#39;Many psychologists would argue that all anger begins with blame.&#39;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Okay, a tiny bit about me...for me, it&#39;s a problem of expecting that <br/>
the world SHOULD treat me better. Well, that would be nice, but <br/>
having expectations that don&#39;t get met lead to me feeling sad, angry, <br/>
etc. I have to work on expecting others to do less and spending my <br/>
energy on creating my own happiness. That tends to cut off the <br/>
negative feelings before I get to blaming someone (or everyone).<br/>
