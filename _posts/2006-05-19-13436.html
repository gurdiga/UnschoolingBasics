&gt;Slightly crunchy, unschooling Mom to Landen(2 1/2)  and Gage(7 months)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sheesh!  That&#39;s a really tough experience.  It&#39;s hard to realize this <br/>
in the moment, but in retrospect I&#39;m always grateful to folks like <br/>
this who take themselves out of my life without me having to do any <br/>
of the hard stuff.  I think they&#39;re really doing me a huge <br/>
favor.  Imagine if a relationship with such a frightened, <br/>
insensitive, judgmental, rude, impulsive person were to <br/>
continue!  And, with kids involved!  Ugh!!<br/>
<br/>
I guess almost everything I do could be considered &quot;out there&quot; by the <br/>
mainstream of our society.  A friend once said this to my <br/>
husband:  &quot;Whenever you are doing something that&#39;s out of the <br/>
mainstream, it&#39;s imperative that you surround yourself with some kind <br/>
of like-minded community that&#39;s also out of the mainstream, if only <br/>
to keep your head straight about what you&#39;re doing and where you&#39;re going.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why I found La Leche League meetings so crucial when my son <br/>
was younger, and that blossomed into other relationships that <br/>
supported our lifestyle choices.  I would say that most if not all of <br/>
the relationships we have had were with other families who co-slept <br/>
with their kids and did extended breastfeeding (we knew several <br/>
families with kids breastfeeding up to ages 5 and 6 and even <br/>
beyond!).  Many folks intended to homeschool and were at least able <br/>
to converse about unschooling.  In fact, I first learned about <br/>
unschooling at a group that grew out of a LLL group I was in when my <br/>
son was still in-arms.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve really gone off on a little tangent here, but I guess the more <br/>
you can intentionally surround yourself with like-minded folks, the <br/>
easier you will find it to stay on your path and feel good about your <br/>
choices.  This email discussion list and others like it are <br/>
absolutely crucial, in my opinion, even if you never post.  Even if <br/>
what you do is out of the norm in mainstream society, it&#39;s YOUR norm, <br/>
and that&#39;s all that matters.  If you can make it to any of the <br/>
conferences, you&#39;ll be astounded at how easy it will be for you to <br/>
feel at home with hundreds of folks you&#39;ve never even met before!<br/>
<br/>
Another idea might be trying to get a regular weekly or monthly <br/>
attachment parenting park day going (hanging up flyers in health-food <br/>
stores and libraries) and seeing what kind of face-to-face community <br/>
you can build for yourself and the kids.<br/>
<br/>
This is a whole lot more info than you even asked for!  I hope it&#39;s a <br/>
little helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Stay strong,<br/>

Marji, a rather verbose woman who seems to be unable to end a post <br/>
without some kind of a P.S.<br/>
<br/>
P.S.   I have also found that it&#39;s best to keep most information <br/>
about myself a little close to the vest until I get a good read on <br/>
where folks are at.  All that stuff that I said earlier <br/>
notwithstanding, I prefer--if I can--to be the one to make a choice <br/>
about who is in my life.  Frankly, I prefer not to call attention to <br/>
myself and my out-of-the-mainstream ways unless I have some idea of <br/>
the other party&#39;s level of tolerance for such things.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ren, I want to say thank you for saying this.  I know it&#39;s not directed at<br/>
me, but the Universe sent it to me this morning.  You see, I&#39;ve been having<br/>
trouble with my in-laws for years and this recent decision to unschool<br/>
(about a year ago) really put a huge kink in the relationships.  Last night<br/>
I decided that i just can&#39;t be around them anymore and told my dh.  He<br/>
totally understands.  The last time I tried to talk to my sil about<br/>
homeschooling (2 weeks ago), she told me I was psycho.  In front of my kids<br/>
to boot!  Stormed out of my house, telling me to have a shitty life, cuz<br/>
that&#39;s what I am giving my kids.<br/>
<br/>
Today is my nephew&#39;s birthday party and I just don&#39;t have the strength to<br/>
deal with them anymore.  I realized that just because I&#39;m married to John,<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean I have to like his family or be around them.  I feel so free<br/>
with this decision.  Ren, your quote just confirmed this decision.  Thank<br/>
you so much!!<br/>

<br/>
I have a couple of thoughts.   Maybe she left for reasons other than your<br/>
conversation and because *you* feel a little weird about unschooling you<br/>
attributed it to that?   No?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe she&#39;s come across others who&#39;ve called themselves &quot;unschoolers&quot; who<br/>
were the &quot;My child needed to hit your child and I&#39;m here to facilitate<br/>
his needs&quot; kind of dork-os.   They&#39;re out there.   If that was the case<br/>
she was acting in the best interest of her kid and you can&#39;t blame her<br/>
for that.<br/>
<br/>
You might run into her again and you might just ask.  Especially if your<br/>
kids liked each other.  If she&#39;s someone you can live happily without<br/>
than I want to remind you it honestly doesn&#39;t matter that much, even<br/>
though it feels icky. <br/>
<br/>
Even if you weren&#39;t unschooling there&#39;d be some mom somewhere who&#39;d think<br/>
you were kooky, there just always is.   If you&#39;re vegetarian, if you&#39;re<br/>
atheist, if you&#39;re wiccan, if you&#39;re not christian, if you ARE christian,<br/>
if you buy organic, if you belly dance, if you do cartwheels with your<br/>
kid...  There will always be someone wants to rain on your parade but the<br/>
happier you are with yourself the less their personal hang-ups and<br/>
prejudices will affect you.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry you experienced that.  It&#39;s stinks when people smear you with<br/>
poo.   I remember the day a very cute and nice little kid at the park<br/>
told Dylan he was going to hell.  But on the up side, (for us, not for<br/>
that poor kid) the kid did not stay cute and nice and Dylan, so far, is<br/>
not in hell and has no scheduled departure date. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I mean, at 2.5, whether they go to preschool or not, what does she <br/>

I never realized how lonely it can be to be an unschooler  sometimes.  Today<br/>
<br/>
for the first time i had a mother tell me that i am the  &quot;queen of crazy<br/>
town&quot; <br/>
when she asked me about preschool and i told her that we  where unschooling.<br/>
 <br/>
Landen was happily playing with her little boy at the  park and she just got<br/>
<br/>
up and grabbed him and ran off.  Landen started  bawling.  And it just broke<br/>
<br/>
my heart to hear him.  I sat there and  just cried and cried with my son on<br/>
my <br/>
lap.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1881222144">First to Michelle, I love the T-shirt idea, I&#39;m going<br/>
to have my brother make me some for my birthday. :)<br/>
Even, if all he does is put &quot;Warning: I UNSCHOOL.&quot; is<br/>
going to be awesome. <br/>
<br/>
Okay, on to support. I&#39;ve had to cut off my family,<br/>
and we are still cutting off my husbands. It sucks,<br/>
you ache for their support, but what it boils down to,<br/>
what do your kids need more? I didn&#39;t want (still<br/>
refuse) to have my son around drunks. To be honest, I<br/>
thought my parents would never come around again. I<br/>
told my dad his behavior was unacceptable, and if he<br/>
was going to drink, not to do it anywhere near us. He<br/>
hasn&#39;t, I think because for a year and a half, I<br/>
refused contact. And when we did reconnect, I had<br/>
&#39;rules&#39;. Their term not mine. <br/>
I hope things get better for you. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve had to do the same with many of our family members.  MNSHO is that if<br/>
they are not honoring what you are doing in your life then they are not<br/>
supportive.  If you are the brunt of family jokes, ridiculed and constantly<br/>
questioned then you do not have support.  Despite the fact that my children<br/>
did eventually wean, sleep in their own beds (at their request), haven&#39;t had<br/>
any major illnesses, and a plethora of other things that my family was sure<br/>
would happen because of my odd ball non-mainstreaming parenting my family<br/>
still thinks that because I don&#39;t follow the status quo that I am harming my<br/>
children.  We have a mostly &quot;created family&quot; made up of people who honor our<br/>
family and all its eccentricities even if they don&#39;t follow those<br/>
eccentricities themselves.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-820659230">Oh Alyssa, there was something more to that exchange that you <br/>
weren&#39;t being let in on.  Your child is 2!  Anyone who thinks a 2 <br/>
yr. old should be in school shouldn&#39;t be labeling other people as <br/>
crazy!  <br/>
<br/>
FWIW, I don&#39;t use the term unschooling too much.  We just say we <br/>
homeschool.  I haven&#39;t had anyone ask me about curriculum since we <br/>
stopped using it but if they ask me, I&#39;ll just say that we&#39;re <br/>
eclectic and use a little of this and a little of that according to <br/>
the children&#39;s interests, which is true.  With a child as young as <br/>
yours, I&#39;d be extremely confident in saying that we still have a ton <br/>
of time before worrying about formal structure and we just live and <br/>
learn by playing together every day.  If the person wants to think <br/>
you crazy and not associate with you, then pretty likely that person <br/>
has nothing to offer you in friendship.  Or perhaps she&#39;s had people <br/>
talking to her about unschooling and it just scares the pants off <br/>
her so her coping mechanism is to run away.  Either way, there&#39;s no <br/>
reason for you to feel personally upset.  Just shake your head and <br/>
move on.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve made few lasting friendships within a homeschooling circle.  <br/>
I&#39;ve found that it&#39;s easier for people to &#39;hang&#39; together when they <br/>
share a common interest, and the majority of people I&#39;ve met don&#39;t <br/>
care that we share homeschooling.  They want to know you use the <br/>
same materials.  At some functions, I&#39;ve had women walk up to me, <br/>
introduce themselves and immediately ask me what curriculum I&#39;m <br/>
using.  When I don&#39;t give them the answer they want, they politely <br/>
excuse themselves and don&#39;t come back to me.  I have since had <br/>
the .... um... pleasure? of sitting with homeschoolers who share a <br/>
common homeschooling curriculum.  They discuss curriculum the entire <br/>
time every single time they get together.  If they aren&#39;t discussing <br/>
the actual curriculum, they&#39;re discussing how to discipline their <br/>
children to make them more obedient in doing their schoolwork.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, to be honest, I&#39;ve been one of those moms who sit around <br/>
discussing curriculum all the time.  And now that I&#39;m no longer <br/>
enamored of the stupid materials, I&#39;m less tolerant of being in a <br/>
group that discusses those things.  If you haven&#39;t yet tried, you <br/>
may want to look for general homeschooling groups in your area.  You <br/>
might have more luck since people in a general group will use so <br/>
many different materials.  Also, if I need to, I will tell people <br/>
I&#39;m using Sonlight, which is a literature based program.  It&#39;s not a <br/>
lie, but I don&#39;t into details that we don&#39;t use the program as <br/>
designed.  It really boils down to a super great list of books and <br/>
as we love reading together, we get many great suggestions from the <br/>
catalog.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope you feel better soon.<br/>

like &quot;no, not for another 2 months or so. Twins!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Once in a bookstore a young woman with a very small boy reacted to my <br/>
&quot;twins!&quot; answer truly bizzarely - she grabbed her son&#39;s hand and dragged him away, <br/>
walking backward keeping an eye on me the whole time muttering &quot;oh no, not for <br/>
us. no twins. no no no.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t about me, it was about her. <br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t about you, it was about her.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, it&#39;s good to be queen. :)<br/>

No tapes of funshops (what a nightmare *that* could be! &lt;bwg&gt;). We&#39;re <br/>
working on taping the main presentations now.<br/>

  School&#39;s goal is to prepare them to be anything they want. But the  <br/>
process is so dullifying and kids haven&#39;t explored the possibilities  <br/>
of what they could be that many set their sites as low as possible.  <br/>
They go to college to get a job to buy stuff. ~Joyce Fetteroll<br/>
