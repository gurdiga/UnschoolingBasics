<div id="ygrps-yiv-766377976">&lt;&lt;It is kind of a scary thing to really test whether this will work -<br/>
giving yourself a huge abundance of the things that have, in the<br/>
past, felt like a weakness. But in a world of abundance, our minds<br/>
seem to relax and start to think more clearly and we make more<br/>
thoughtful choices.<br/>
<br/>
It is AMAZING how strong and how pervasive the impact of a sense of<br/>
scarcity or limitation can be.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This really makes sense to me...thank you...but I worry about this test <br/>
period and how much weight _I_ will gain...not my kids.  They have <br/>
energy to burn tons of calories.  I&#39;m losing baby fat from my 5 month <br/>
old baby #5.  Will it ever go away if I have coke and pringles and pop <br/>
tarts in the house that _I will eat_ in the beginning...can I moderate <br/>
myself and still be &quot;radical&quot; or should I just continue eating as I have <br/>
been (with a watchful eye but indulging in the luxury of chocolate once <br/>
in a while) and let the kids be radical instead?<br/>

about what that makes you - radical or not is NOT the point.<br/>
