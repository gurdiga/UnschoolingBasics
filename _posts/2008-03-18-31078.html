<div id="ygrps-yiv-345826566">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I am a WAH & HS mom of 3 children- 7,12, and 14. I have been HS since <br/>
my oldest was in 3rd grade. I have gone back and forth with the <br/>
unschool approach due to issues with local family members making life <br/>
miserable based on our &quot;way of schooling&quot;. We&#39;ve been forced to school <br/>
in a more traditional approach and are currently using Math-u-See, <br/>
Sonlight, EPS books, and some websites for schooling. <br/>
<br/>
Do any of you have any pushy family members trying to control how you <br/>
school your kids?????? If so, how do you deal with it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for your advice:)</div>

  Hi and welcome to the group!  If you really want honest answers to your questions/concerns, then you&#39;ll love it here &lt;g&gt;.  My twin girls are only 3, and already I&#39;ve heard lots from my in-laws about their opinion (read: fears) about our plans to keep out girls free from school.<br/>
   <br/>
  ~~We&#39;ve been forced to school in a more traditional approach and are currently using Math-u-See, Sonlight, EPS books, and some websites for schooling.~~<br/>
   <br/>
  &#39;Forced&#39; to??  Did they get some sort of court order???  If not, them I&#39;m not clear on how anyone outside your home could &#39;force&#39; you to do anything! <br/>
<br/>
~~Do any of you have any pushy family members trying to control how you <br/>

   <br/>
  Yep, I told them they already had the chance to raise their kids, and these are our kids and we will do what works best for us thank you very much.  And if they really really got in the way and made us miserable because of their opinions/fears, I would have no problem telling them they aren&#39;t welcome in our home.  These are YOUR kids and it&#39;s YOUR decision not theirs!!!<br/>
   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>What family members and why do you give them so much power in your <br/>
life?  If you&#39;re talking parents and siblings, I&#39;d say you&#39;re giving <br/>
them too much power in your life.  What other decisions do you let <br/>
them make for you?  Do they tell you how to eat, how to dress, who to <br/>
have a relationship with, etc.?  If so, that&#39;s truly too much power.  <br/>
If it&#39;s your husband/partner, that needs to be addressed differently.  <br/>
Your partner has as much say in your children&#39;s upbringing as you do.  <br/>
It&#39;s still possible and should be as much of a joint process as <br/>
possible.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-381736835">I am new at this also, but I think I&#39;ve found an effective method to deal with &#39;em. Ask them to help you locate any credible source of proof that unschooling is ineffective. This solves at least two problems: 1. it keeps them busy and out of your hair, and 2. it will by default help educate them on unschooling. Now I must admit my wife did not fall for it and recognized immediately what my strategy was, but her defiance and her excuse not to do it showed me that deep down she really must trust my decision to unschool since she doesn&#39;t stand in my way of doing it and what little resistance she does show is really just testing me to see if I really know what I&#39;m talking about. It also leaves the door open for her to say she told me so if ever there is a problem with unschooling, but we all here know that ain&#39;t gonna happen. So she and I are at a cease fire level right now, which is fine by me.<br/>

Why are *you* letting anyone force you to do anything? No one can force <br/>
you against your will. Why are you letting them?<br/>

Most of us probably have had some extended family issues. Basically, <br/>
they had their chance to raise you the way they saw fit. If they didn&#39;t <br/>
think what they did resulted in a competent adult, maybe their ways <br/>
didn&#39;t work so well and maybe they should back off. If they think that <br/>
what they did was GREAT and resulted in a very competent adult, then <br/>
maybe they need to back off and let you doo *your* best withOUT their <br/>
interference.<br/>
<br/>
If they decide that they cannot play well with others, maybe it&#39;s time <br/>
to take you ball and go home!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1426587947">i&#39;m with her on this one!!  &#39;forced&#39;..i&#39;ve been homeschooling for <br/>
about 4 years and i don&#39;t care what curriculum i&#39;m using, no <br/>
one &#39;forces&#39; me to do anything!! <br/>
word of advice?  no matter &#39;what&#39; curriculum you use, there will be <br/>
family members out there that disagree.  let them.  but, and this may <br/>
sound harsh, when my mom starts up, i let her know the subject is <br/>
dropped, and i don&#39;t want to discuss it.  don&#39;t let anyone &#39;force&#39; <br/>
you to do anything.  do what &#39;you&#39; want, they&#39;re the ones that need <br/>
to adapt.<br/>
