<div id="ygrps-yiv-597823944">Yes, I kinda figured we wouldn&#39;t be lucky enough to have a truck full of<br/>
unschoolers banging down our door!  Darn!<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea how long the virus would live, say on a t-shirt or a<br/>
lolli-pop, but we&#39;re nearing the end of our &#39;infectious phase&#39; I believe.<br/>

Best of luck with your search!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I believe there is a potential liability with this, especially in this<br/>
population with immune system concerns. <br/>
<br/>
I believe that children, to the best of one&#39;s ability could be given<br/>
information, so that they can make an informed consent or dissent, to<br/>
being intentionally exposed to any disease. We discussed this with our<br/>
3.5 year old son and again at 4.3 y/o when opportunities arose to<br/>
acquire wild chicken pox. And he declined intentional exposure to the<br/>
chicken pox at that time. There will most likely be plenty of<br/>
opportunities to have consensual exposure in the future. There are<br/>
risks to vaccinating (we are completely non-vaccinating) and there are<br/>
risks to the diseases. To intentionally expose anyone (child or adult)<br/>
to diseases (through vaccines or organically) against their will, or<br/>
without their informed consent, is very uncomfortable to me.<br/>
<br/>
I would also assess one&#39;s husband&#39;s chicken pox history, before<br/>
actively choosing to expose any children. If he has not had the pox,<br/>
he might consider vaccination, relocation for the duration of the<br/>
outbreak (2 weeks+), or intentional exposure at the *same* time as the<br/>
children, in order not to be a full secondary household exposure.<br/>
Second case exposure to cp in a household is generally more severe.<br/>
We had chicken pox titers drawn on my husband to ascertain his<br/>
immunity status, as he only recalled &quot;maybe one or two pox&quot;. For an<br/>
adult to acquire secondary exposure could be highly serious.<br/>
<br/>
Also, consider the potential for exposure to other members of your<br/>
family, or others in your playgroups who are pregnant (especially<br/>
first trimester, without prior cp) over the 2nd-4th weeks. And avoid<br/>
airplane recycled air during the 2nd and 3rd week post exposure.<br/>
Airplanes could disseminate chicken pox in a lethal manner to those<br/>
who are immunocompromised.<br/>
<br/>
We have had multiple experiences with friends with the pox with whom<br/>
ds can discuss their experiences. He is able to discuss the pros and<br/>
cons, from his own perspective: itching, comfort options, missed<br/>
activities. As an older child, he can certainly understand more<br/>
long-term decision making, options, reading/photos, discussing with<br/>
medical professionals, research on the internet, etc. I don&#39;t believe<br/>
non-life threatening issues are mine to decide for another individual.<br/>
And he could always opt for vaccination at some point also. (assuming<br/>
that has merit...)<br/>
<br/>
There are natural ways to support the child while ill, so I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
necessarily focus only on &quot;the misery&quot; of the chicken pox. I&#39;ve also<br/>
heard about &quot;acquiring&quot; chicken pox through the mail. Apparently, some<br/>
folks are sending contaminated lolly pops or t-shirt (secured well in<br/>
packaging), overnighted to share with interested families. So, I am<br/>
confident that the solution for our family will unfold, whenever it is<br/>
meant to. I&#39;ve also heard that mailing a virus is illegal, as an fyi.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-805464988">Thank you for your concern.<br/>
<br/>
We are also a group of nonvaccinating people, and we are extremely  <br/>
careful to not go into public while potentially contagious.<br/>
We are also self-educated, and have considered all of the things that  <br/>
you mentioned in your email.<br/>
<br/>
As I mentioned, my children have all had the pox, and to be honest,  <br/>
except for Dan, it was no worse than a cold. Same for mumps, measles  <br/>
and rubella.<br/>
