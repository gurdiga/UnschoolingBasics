<div id="ygrps-yiv-425322507">We have a gecko and fish currently. I have always enjoyed going into <br/>
pet stores and when my son and I are in the vicinity of one we do so <br/>
together. My husband is furious as he feels I am only encouraging my <br/>
son and he feels &quot;set up&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
My son expresses to me but not his dad that he would like another <br/>
pet. He seems to enjoy other kids pets and yearns for a pet to <br/>
cuddle.  I ask him why he doesn&#39;t also talk about it with his dad <br/>
but never answers that question.  <br/>
<br/>
My son had a reaction a couple of times and he was tested for <br/>
allergies.  He came back positive for both cats and dogs but since <br/>
that time he has been around both many times with little to no <br/>
reaction.  He does have bad skin rashes but does so with or without <br/>
contact with animals.  He refuses to put on the cream that the <br/>
doctor has offered.  So I let it go and offer form time to time <br/>
figuring if he gets uncomfortable enough he might be willing to try <br/>
the cream again.  (We have tried various creams and lotions and he <br/>
just hates the feel of them on his skin.) <br/>
<br/>
My husband has been quite clear he doesn&#39;t want another pet in the <br/>
house. He has had surgeries and doesn&#39;t feel up to taking care of <br/>
it. He doesn&#39;t want a pet pooping inside our fence since my son runs <br/>
barefoot and he also has his garden. He doesn&#39;t want an inside cat <br/>
or rabbit. He actually doesn&#39;t seem open to exploring any options.<br/>
<br/>
From an unschooling perspective how can I respect my dh&#39;s <br/>
preferences without giving up what my son and I <br/>
would enjoy?<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions would be appreciated.<br/>

 My husband has been quite clear he doesn&#39;t want another pet in the<br/>
 house. He has had surgeries and doesn&#39;t feel up to taking care of<br/>
 it.<br/>

<br/>
  Would he have to? Can you and your son cover everything? Can you <br/>
&quot;guarantee&quot; that?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 He doesn&#39;t want a pet pooping inside our fence since my son runs<br/>
 barefoot and he also has his garden.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
  Scoop the poop immediately afterwards. Every time. Every day. Son <br/>
agrees to wear shoes.<br/>
<br/>
  I keep my garden separate from the dogs because I don&#39;t want my beans <br/>
and asparagus and cukes and tomatoes peed on. I understand! &lt;G&gt; My dogs <br/>
know the command, &quot;GETOUTTAMYGARDEN!&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
 He doesn&#39;t want an inside cat<br/>
 or rabbit. He actually doesn&#39;t seem open to exploring any options.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  How about an outside rabbit? Ours lives outside. She has a *huge* (by <br/>
rabbit standards) above-ground cage. Bunnies can handle extremely cold <br/>
temperatures, as long as they have straw and and shelter and covering. <br/>
They canNOT handle heat. Clover is in a smaller &quot;show bunny&quot; cage this <br/>
week in the kitchen. When the temperature gets over 90 degrees, I bring <br/>
all the critters inside. I *could* put her in the garage, which is <br/>
tolerable, but I feel better when she is more comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
  But an outside bunny is a possibility, NO? OH! And tell him: bunny <br/>
poop is GREAT for the garden! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 From an unschooling perspective how can I respect my dh&#39;s<br/>
 preferences without giving up what my son and I<br/>
 would enjoy?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
  I think that if one person is truly against it, that may be the way it <br/>
needs to be to keep peace. That said, I&#39;m a bit of an animal freak, and <br/>
am willing to look into options. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Working at the wildlife rescue? they can&#39;t come home with him, but he <br/>
can go daily to care for/feed/rehabilitate them. You&#39;re not allowed to <br/>
get *too* attached, because they need to be released.<br/>
<br/>
  Help a local dog breeder. He could scoop poop and clean runs and take <br/>
care of the dogs when the breeder is gone on show weekends. He could <br/>
learn how to care for and groom and whelp even! Or go to shows as the <br/>
gopher. I always had a couple of girls (8-12 yo) tagging along with me!<br/>
<br/>
 I&#39;m sorry there&#39;s no consensus on the pet issue, but that&#39;s a BIG one!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-690718089">Hi Joanne,<br/>
<br/>
Have you considered the many pets that can be kept &quot;caged&quot; but still are accessible to Kevin ?  Alex has a guinea pig and she loves to play out of her cage.  Her mess is confined to the cage.  You can get a baby yard to bring outside if Kevin wishes to bring her/him outside  & you&#39;ll never notice the poop. Ours loves playing in the grass.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have one but I&#39;ve heard rats are great pets.  What about a bird?  You can train them to perch on your hand or shoulder.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
<br/>

OOOH! Yes!<br/>
<br/>
Rats are the best of the rodents! Smart. Clean. Friendly. Come when you <br/>
call! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t get rats bred for snake food though! Get rats bred as show rats, <br/>
handled since birth, and well-socialized.<br/>
<br/>
Be sure to get at least two---not just one. They&#39;re *very* social and <br/>
need a ratty partner.<br/>

one for just over 2 years (it died this past weekend and lived a full<br/>
happy life). Hand tamed hamsters tend to love their owners.  They like<br/>
sitting in their pockets and riding around on their shoulders.  They<br/>
can be set lose in a &quot;rodent ball&quot; and are quite entertaining.  Easy<br/>
to care for and as long as they eat the right kind of foods (and a<br/>
variety) their poop is fairly unsmelly and easy to clean up.  Maybe a<br/>
compromise between dad and son.  Perhaps if your son can show<br/>
responsibility for his hamster in a few years when the hamster goes to<br/>
the big hamster wheel in the sky dad may be a bit more open to a<br/>
larger pet with a longer life span.<br/>

I second the rats as great pets!   We used to have 5 (boys and girls, <br/>
of course, 2 big cages!).  They&#39;re very sweet, but they don&#39;t live <br/>
long (all of ours only lasted about 2 years each).    I cried <br/>
everytime we lost one, but they were WONDERFUL!   I just can&#39;t handle <br/>
losing them, so we didn&#39;t get any more.  We&#39;re down to a cat (who <br/>
thinks she&#39;s a dog!), which is easy to have someone come in to feed <br/>
her when we go camping.   Goldfish are really easy too!<br/>

Because snake food also tends to bite, and are usually<br/>

Just be sure they are of the same sex. lol At one time<br/>
I had 34. Not a good choice to have babies.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re down from four to one now. :-(<br/>
<br/>
~Kelly, I am so sorry. They just don&#39;t live long<br/>
enough. I had Jake for a long time in rat years. He<br/>
was such a sweetie, not that my other ones we not. But<br/>
he gave kisses. He will forever be missed in my heart.<br/>

If we took a holiday... Took some time to celebrate... Just one day out of life... It would be so nice...<br/>

A few notes about birds, although they can be terrific pets!  They can <br/>
be incredibly messy and loud, depending on the bird you get.  We had a <br/>
cockatiel...THE sweetest bird in the world (loved to be cuddled), but <br/>
she screamed bloody murder all day, every day if she wasn&#39;t with you.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, please never, ever train a bird to sit on your shoulder.  It can <br/>
be very dangerous.  My little cockatiel loved to sit on my shoulder <br/>
and nestle in my hair. Lots of fun and very sweet.  She pecked at my <br/>
eye nearly a year ago, however, and I am still having to take regular <br/>
trips to the eye doc and have to medicate it daily because of that one <br/>
incident.  If she had been a larger bird she would have done much more <br/>
damage.<br/>

<br/>
Not only should birds not sit on your shoulder because<br/>
of that danger, but because then the bird thinks it is<br/>
the boss. It&#39;s all about being higher than you and<br/>
therefor the alpha bird so to speak. <br/>
I&#39;ve had so many pets. Which is why I&#39;ve chimmed in. I<br/>
also worked in a pet store and took my duty to gain<br/>
knowledge to actually help customers very seriously.<br/>
It&#39;s been handy. I have a son, who&#39;d love to have<br/>
every pet, I&#39;d love it too. If only we could afford<br/>
it.<br/>

can live for 10+ years and larger birds like Cockatiels and parrots<br/>
can live for 50+ years.  Many larger birds outlive their owners so it<br/>
is best to make sure that if you get a larger bird that you make<br/>
provisions for it in your will.  We had a birdier in our group for a<br/>
while and she had several parrots that she had adopted because their<br/>
owners had passed on.<br/>

They&#39;re quite easy and very cute and interesting.  And once they get used to you, there&#39;s really no fear of pinching.  We found this to be one of the best web sites for a very infatuated hermie owner!<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hermit-crabs.com/">http://www.hermit-crabs.com/</a>  we&#39;ve already had two molts (this happens a lot when they&#39;re little)....it&#39;s very cool.  I may just become a fanatic about hermit crabs, too!<br/>
