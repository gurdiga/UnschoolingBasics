<div id="ygrps-yiv-2121359416"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;And why would you use algebra? Gee :) How many pizzas do we have to<br/>
&gt; buy so that each of nine people gets three slices? I can&#39;t believe I<br/>
&gt; am explaining this :)&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That depends on how many slices there are in each pizza. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep, that&#39;s where my kids would say, &quot;Hmmm.  There are only 10 slices of pizza and we each want 3 slices. How can we get 2 more slices of pizza so we don&#39;t have to shell out anymore money.  Look, these two slices are a bit bigger than the rest.  If we cut them each in half we can all have 3 slices.&quot;  To which, one of those kids is going to say, &quot;You know I&#39;m really not all that hungry.  I think I&#39;ll just have one slice and some salad.  You two can split the rest.&quot;  :-)  <br/>

Pizza doesn&#39;t work very well for real life algebra in our family.  Ice cream though.......<br/>

<br/>
And when does a group of nine people all like only one kind of pizza?? My<br/>
experience is that the first thing that happens is everyone asks each other<br/>
what toppings they all want - so it really is sets and subsets not algebra.<br/>
