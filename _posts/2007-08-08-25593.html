<div id="ygrps-yiv-511968303">Below I will list a message that I have posted to the groups with <br/>
mix of hs/unschool styles.  I am posting it hear completely willing <br/>
and open to unschool but I guess needing to find my security in it <br/>
again.  I have pretty much unschooled...my children continue to <br/>
learn, but I still feel fearful that my older son is a late reader <br/>
and somehow I will be looked as having failed him if he does not get <br/>
the &quot;basics.&quot;  JUst keeping it real but truly wanting to find the <br/>
best way for us to do this.  Thanks in advance for your responses.<br/>
<br/>
Peace<br/>
Tyra<br/>
<br/>
Peace to you all!<br/>
<br/>
I seek balance in helping my son to learn.  He started as a young <br/>
homeschooler.  He turned 5 in September 05 and we semi-began in May <br/>
of that year (I began with my umbrella schools calendar and because <br/>
I knew we were moving sometime in September/Ocotober.)<br/>
<br/>
I started out as a scared neophyte who merely did not want to fail <br/>
her child in his home education experience.  QUICKLY we got burned <br/>
out.  It was right around the time that I had been learning more <br/>
about unschooling.  We moved at the end of Septemeber and that began <br/>
our unschooling experience for the next couple of months.<br/>
<br/>
It was amazing because I pretty much went rad and did all I could to <br/>
lift arbitrary controls on them, especially with respect to watching <br/>
TV because I am pretty laidback regarding bedtime and eating anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I have loved unschooling but the problem for me is making sure that <br/>
my husband&#39;s desires are met with respect to his children learning.  <br/>
He would prefer school at home but has pretty much left it all up to <br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
So for my sons age 6 year/1st grade year, we have been laidback.  We <br/>
have had a great time.  I have also learned some things about me.  I <br/>
can be very structured and I can get things done.  Whatever I am <br/>
most interested in is what will draw me in.  There are many times <br/>
when I find myself completly absorbed in working on my projects <br/>
(such as launching my online business).  I don&#39;t particularly like <br/>
doing a lot of schoolish things anyway because he does not enjoy <br/>
them so we have not done a lot of structured learning in a <br/>
consistent way.  I have decided that I don&#39;t feel comfortable <br/>
waiting for my son to learn to read in his own time.  I don&#39;t want <br/>
to push him but reading and math have been subjects that I seek to <br/>
work with him on eventhough we usually did so in a nontraditional <br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
But our lives are getting a wee bit busier.  Though I seek to scale <br/>
outside activities back, really we are happier when we do things on <br/>
the go.  We do fieldtrips, hs pe, hs chess club and sometimes my son <br/>
will participate in a sport.  I continue to work on my business and <br/>
am even going to work a few hours outside my home.<br/>
<br/>
As a result, I thought it would be best to introduce a little <br/>
structure into what we do.  I know my son is young, almost 7 yrs <br/>
old.  I know he is a boy and boys learn best through movement.  I <br/>
have gone out of my way to accomodate his kinesthetic style of <br/>
learning.  We do an online reading program that is completely <br/>
interactive and the math program that I use is montessori based. <br/>
<br/>
IF he was a little more motivated to do SOMETHING, ANYTHING to learn <br/>
to read and better understand math, I would not feel pressured to <br/>
carve out time (which is MAYBE an hour a day) to do these subjects.  <br/>
Really, I feel pressure to make sure that he learns certain things.  <br/>
And just to be clear, there is no doubt in me that he will <br/>
eventually be able to do all of this on his own.  Howvever, given <br/>
this culture and my hubby&#39;s expectations, I truly feel like we need <br/>
to something more in a consistent manner than we have.<br/>
<br/>
We have been doing math and reading everyday for MAYBE 2 weeks.  I <br/>
think it is only a week and a half.  I decided that we would SLOWLY <br/>
integrate doing these since we have not done much in the last month <br/>
or so.  AGain, we are always learnng but maybe not actively engaged <br/>
in math and reading.<br/>
<br/>
I am a mother who is obviously frustrated but also saddened because <br/>
I have gone out of my way to accomodate him.  I am still willing to <br/>
do so but I am beginning to feel like a villan.  He told me this <br/>
morning that he wants to go to school.  I think to myself, &quot;you HATE <br/>
school work so why would you want to go to school?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Getting around to my questions:  Are we normal?  For those who are <br/>
more laidback in their approach to learning, what suggestions do you <br/>
have for helping me to go back to relaxing with a child who is not <br/>
schoolish?  I remember a mother telling me that when her kids were <br/>
ages 5-7 they were hardest to homeschool because they are <br/>
transitioning from being self-centered (not in a bad way but based <br/>
on getting their needs met as an infant) to expanding their world <br/>
view a bit more.  She said it was not her favorite time to <br/>
homeschool any of them.  So for anyone, did you have a similar <br/>
experience during these ages?  I guess I want to know if we are <br/>
normal and will just have to work through this?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to any for your wisdom and suggestions in advance!<br/>
<br/>
Peacefully,<br/>

You weren&#39;t unschooling. You were just letting him be while you did <br/>
other things. Unschooling is about trusting that he will learn when he <br/>
is ready. That INCLUDES reading and math.<br/>

Don&#39;t make this about your husband. It&#39;s not. It&#39;s about whether you <br/>

<br/>
So---it&#39;s OK for you to get drawn in my whatever you&#39;re most interested <br/>
in, but he doesn&#39;t get the same freedom?<br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t enjoy schoolish things---what *does* he enjoy? Maybe we can <br/>
show you the math and reading in what he DOES love to do. Then you can <br/>
relax.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>

YOU don&#39;t feel comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t believe he will, you&#39;re right. Buy a curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
We used to talk about the paradigm shift here a lot. Until you can make <br/>
that shift, you will not be able to unschool.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Why are you looking to unschool? What do you think is so great about <br/>
it? You don&#39;t believe it---that learning happens naturally. Why are you <br/>
clinging to unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
If you truly believe he needs to be reading at seven, buy the <br/>
curriculum, work with him every day, and believe you&#39;re teaching him to <br/>
read.<br/>
<br/>
Seriously.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t for everyone. Way too many parents believe that <br/>
reading and math programs will work. If you do, DO it. You really don&#39;t <br/>
have to unchool. There are zillions of curricula out there---there are <br/>
even public and private and parochial and Montessoori and <br/>
Waldorf/Steiner---all KINDS of schools as options. Unschooling may not <br/>
be the option for you.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
IF he was a little more motivated to do SOMETHING, ANYTHING to learn<br/>
to read and better understand math, I would not feel pressured to<br/>
carve out time (which is MAYBE an hour a day) to do these subjects.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And I guess if you were a little more motivated to learn about <br/>
unschooling it would be working for you already. You&#39;re not ready.<br/>
<br/>
I could push you and push you. I could make you read articles and <br/>
websites and books and elists and message boards and books and blogs. <br/>
But if you aren&#39;t motivated, it just doesn&#39;t matter how hard I push, <br/>
does it? I could make it fun: I could make it interactive! I could <br/>
print articles on brightly colored paper. We could talk about it while <br/>
we jogged or swam or gardened. Would that make it more palatable? We <br/>
could make it a computer game: I give multiple choice or true/false <br/>
questions---and gold stars for the right answers. Would that make you <br/>
learn about unschooling faster? I could compare you to other moms who <br/>
figured it out faster---accelerated unschoolers! Or put you in the <br/>
class for---&quot;slow&quot; learners so that we could work harder (every day for <br/>
an hour---one-on-one!) to get you to understand. I could find your <br/>
learning style and make sure we &quot;taught&quot; in the way you learned best.<br/>
<br/>
Learning doesn&#39;t happen like that. *YOU* must be the motivated party. <br/>
He&#39;s not motivated yet---which means he&#39;s not ready.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s only seven. When he&#39;s ten and still struggling, what will you do? <br/>
Send him to experts?<br/>
<br/>
When he&#39;s ten and reading, will you congratulate yourself for having <br/>
taught him to read?<br/>
<br/>
Did you do that when he learned to walk? You *did* teach him to walk, <br/>
right? Right at 12 months?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Really, I feel pressure to make sure that he learns certain things.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
From whom?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And just to be clear, there is no doubt in me that he will<br/>
eventually be able to do all of this on his own.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
There *IS* doubt. BIG doubt. Don&#39;t kid yourself here. Go back and read <br/>
what you wrote. Lots and lots of doubt.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Howvever, given this culture and my hubby&#39;s expectations, I truly feel <br/>
like we need<br/>
to something more in a consistent manner than we have.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Then do that.<br/>
<br/>
But you know what? We ALL live in this culture. The culture has nothing <br/>
to do with whether you understand the philosophy and how to implement <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
We have been doing math and reading everyday for MAYBE 2 weeks.  I<br/>
think it is only a week and a half.  I decided that we would SLOWLY<br/>
integrate doing these since we have not done much in the last month<br/>
or so.  AGain, we are always learnng but maybe not actively engaged<br/>
in math and reading.<br/>
<br/>
--=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re kidding yourself again.---Unless you have him locked in a room <br/>
with no written words and nothing to count with---you plug his ears, <br/>
blindfold him, and bind his fingers and toes? &lt;g&gt; he IS actively <br/>
learning. You just need to start actually SEEING the learning.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I am a mother who is obviously frustrated but also saddened because<br/>
I have gone out of my way to accomodate him.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yikes! He&#39;s your CHILD, and he&#39;s LEARNING. You&#39;re saddened because <br/>
you&#39;re going out of your way to &quot;accomodate&quot; him? He&#39;s seven, for <br/>
crying out loud!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I am still willing to do so but I am beginning to feel like a villan.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t understand. What do you think you are doing that&#39;s villanous? <br/>
What does your son think you&#39;re doing that&#39;s villanous?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
He told me this morning that he wants to go to school.  I think to <br/>
myself, &quot;you HATE<br/>
school work so why would you want to go to school?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
No, he hates being having his mother as his teacher. A very common <br/>
problem in school-at-home families. Standards are high, pressure is <br/>
high, and child feels like crap because he can&#39;t please his own <br/>
mom---OR even complain to his mom and dad that his teacher sucks.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Getting around to my questions:  Are we normal?  For those who are<br/>
more laidback in their approach to learning, what suggestions do you<br/>
have for helping me to go back to relaxing with a child who is not<br/>
schoolish?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure I understand what you&#39;re asking. You want him to be <br/>
&quot;schoolish?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How many of you unschoolers here have a &quot;schoolish&quot; child?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I remember a mother telling me that when her kids were<br/>
ages 5-7 they were hardest to homeschool because they are<br/>
transitioning from being self-centered (not in a bad way but based<br/>
on getting their needs met as an infant) to expanding their world<br/>
view a bit more.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
No, they were having a hard time going from loved, cared-for *child* to <br/>
attacked, pressured *student*!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  She said it was not her favorite time to homeschool any of them.<br/>
<br/>
-=-===-<br/>
<br/>
And as she believes, so shall it be.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 So for anyone, did you have a similar experience during these ages?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
No, because we weren&#39;t trying to school-at-home. We just kept living <br/>
rich, unschooled lives. Nothing changed.<br/>
<br/>
Had I been pushing reading and math, we probably would have.<br/>
<br/>
Not our reality though.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I guess I want to know if we are normal and will just have to work <br/>
through this?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Depends. Do you want to unschool or school-at-home?<br/>
<br/>
If you choose to unschool, you will need to spend the next couple of <br/>
years DEschooling yourself before you can begin to unschool your son.<br/>
<br/>
If you school-at-home, I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re just hitting the absolute, <br/>
tiniest *tip* of the iceberg.<br/>

But if you aren&#39;t motivated, it just doesn&#39;t matter how hard I push, <br/>
does it? I could make it fun: I could make it interactive! I could <br/>
print articles on brightly colored paper. We could talk about it while <br/>
we jogged or swam or gardened. Would that make it more palatable? We <br/>
could make it a computer game: I give multiple choice or true/false <br/>
questions---and gold stars for the right answers. Would that make you <br/>
learn about unschooling faster? I could compare you to other moms who <br/>
figured it out faster---accelerated unschoolers! Or put you in the <br/>
class for---&quot;slow&quot; learners so that we could work harder (every day for <br/>
an hour---one-on-one!) to get you to understand. I could find your <br/>
learning style and make sure we &quot;taught&quot; in the way you learned best.<br/>
<br/>
Learning doesn&#39;t happen like that. *YOU* must be the motivated party. <br/>
He&#39;s not motivated yet---which means he&#39;s not ready.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s only seven. When he&#39;s ten and still struggling, what will you do? <br/>
Send him to experts?<br/>
<br/>
When he&#39;s ten and reading, will you congratulate yourself for having <br/>
taught him to read?<br/>
<br/>
Did you do that when he learned to walk? You *did* teach him to walk, <br/>
right? Right at 12 months?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Really, I feel pressure to make sure that he learns certain things.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
From whom?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And just to be clear, there is no doubt in me that he will<br/>
eventually be able to do all of this on his own.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
There *IS* doubt. BIG doubt. Don&#39;t kid yourself here. Go back and read <br/>
what you wrote. Lots and lots of doubt.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Howvever, given this culture and my hubby&#39;s expectations, I truly feel <br/>
like we need<br/>
to something more in a consistent manner than we have.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Then do that.<br/>
<br/>
But you know what? We ALL live in this culture. The culture has nothing <br/>
to do with whether you understand the philosophy and how to implement <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
We have been doing math and reading everyday for MAYBE 2 weeks.  I<br/>
think it is only a week and a half.  I decided that we would SLOWLY<br/>
integrate doing these since we have not done much in the last month<br/>
or so.  AGain, we are always learnng but maybe not actively engaged<br/>
in math and reading.<br/>
<br/>
--=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re kidding yourself again.---Unless you have him locked in a room <br/>
with no written words and nothing to count with---you plug his ears, <br/>
blindfold him, and bind his fingers and toes? &lt;g&gt; he IS actively <br/>
learning. You just need to start actually SEEING the learning.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I am a mother who is obviously frustrated but also saddened because<br/>
I have gone out of my way to accomodate him.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yikes! He&#39;s your CHILD, and he&#39;s LEARNING. You&#39;re saddened because <br/>
you&#39;re going out of your way to &quot;accomodate&quot; him? He&#39;s seven, for <br/>
crying out loud!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I am still willing to do so but I am beginning to feel like a villan.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t understand. What do you think you are doing that&#39;s villanous? <br/>
What does your son think you&#39;re doing that&#39;s villanous?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
He told me this morning that he wants to go to school.  I think to <br/>
myself, &quot;you HATE<br/>
school work so why would you want to go to school?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
No, he hates being having his mother as his teacher. A very common <br/>
problem in school-at-home families. Standards are high, pressure is <br/>
high, and child feels like crap because he can&#39;t please his own <br/>
mom---OR even complain to his mom and dad that his teacher sucks.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Getting around to my questions:  Are we normal?  For those who are<br/>
more laidback in their approach to learning, what suggestions do you<br/>
have for helping me to go back to relaxing with a child who is not<br/>
schoolish?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure I understand what you&#39;re asking. You want him to be <br/>
&quot;schoolish?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How many of you unschoolers here have a &quot;schoolish&quot; child?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I remember a mother telling me that when her kids were<br/>
ages 5-7 they were hardest to homeschool because they are<br/>
transitioning from being self-centered (not in a bad way but based<br/>
on getting their needs met as an infant) to expanding their world<br/>
view a bit more.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
No, they were having a hard time going from loved, cared-for *child* to <br/>
attacked, pressured *student*!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  She said it was not her favorite time to homeschool any of them.<br/>
<br/>
-=-===-<br/>
<br/>
And as she believes, so shall it be.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 So for anyone, did you have a similar experience during these ages?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
No, because we weren&#39;t trying to school-at-home. We just kept living <br/>
rich, unschooled lives. Nothing changed.<br/>
<br/>
Had I been pushing reading and math, we probably would have.<br/>
<br/>
Not our reality though.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I guess I want to know if we are normal and will just have to work <br/>
through this?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Depends. Do you want to unschool or school-at-home?<br/>
<br/>
If you choose to unschool, you will need to spend the next couple of <br/>
years DEschooling yourself before you can begin to unschool your son.<br/>
<br/>
If you school-at-home, I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re just hitting the absolute, <br/>
tiniest *tip* of the iceberg.<br/>

does lessons or anything like that.  They would rebel big time if I <br/>
pulled out workbooks LOL, and that&#39;s just fine with me! ;-) They <br/>
learn - when they are ready. I&#39;ve seen that work too many times to <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2067577338">You know, sometimes we know and believe but we forget.  I think that is what has happened to me.  As I have pondered responses that I have received from my different groups, I think to myself that I need to get a bit more simplicity in my life.  I decided to homeschool him the first year that we started this learning at home thing.  It was after the utter failure of my schoolish approach.  But my life was way more simple and so I could see that he was learning.<br/>
<br/>
I still stand true that I do reside in insecurity.  What I gained for your words, Kelly, is to not scapegoat an take responsibility for what is really going on.  The truth is that I fear that I will fail at unschooling.  I am also clear that I fear having fingers point at me saying that I failed in some way.  All of this coupled with my busy-ness makes me want to do more structured things so that I can have a peace of mind that we are at least doing something.<br/>
<br/>
So now I am off to ponder and determine how to integrate more simplicity so that I CAN see that my children are learning.<br/>

It was amazing because I pretty much went rad and did all I could to<br/>
lift arbitrary controls on them, especially with respect to watching<br/>
TV because I am pretty laidback regarding bedtime and eating anyway.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
You weren&#39;t unschooling. You were just letting him be while you did <br/>
other things. Unschooling is about trusting that he will learn when he <br/>
is ready. That INCLUDES reading and math.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I have loved unschooling but the problem for me is making sure that<br/>
my husband&#39;s desires are met with respect to his children learning.<br/>
He would prefer school at home but has pretty much left it all up to<br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t make this about your husband. It&#39;s not. It&#39;s about whether you <br/>
think your son will read on your schedule.<br/>
<br/>
-==-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
So for my sons age 6 year/1st grade year, we have been laidback.  We<br/>
have had a great time.  I have also learned some things about me.  I<br/>
can be very structured and I can get things done.  Whatever I am<br/>
most interested in is what will draw me in.  There are many times<br/>
when I find myself completly absorbed in working on my projects<br/>
(such as launching my online business).  I don&#39;t particularly like<br/>
doing a lot of schoolish things anyway because he does not enjoy<br/>
them so we have not done a lot of structured learning in a<br/>
consistent way.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
So---it&#39;s OK for you to get drawn in my whatever you&#39;re most interested <br/>
in, but he doesn&#39;t get the same freedom?<br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t enjoy schoolish things---what *does* he enjoy? Maybe we can <br/>
show you the math and reading in what he DOES love to do. Then you can <br/>
relax.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I have decided that I don&#39;t feel comfortable<br/>
waiting for my son to learn to read in his own time.  I don&#39;t want<br/>
to push him but reading and math have been subjects that I seek to<br/>
work with him on eventhough we usually did so in a nontraditional<br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
YOU don&#39;t feel comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t believe he will, you&#39;re right. Buy a curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
We used to talk about the paradigm shift here a lot. Until you can make <br/>
that shift, you will not be able to unschool.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
As a result, I thought it would be best to introduce a little<br/>
structure into what we do.  I know my son is young, almost 7 yrs<br/>
old.  I know he is a boy and boys learn best through movement.  I<br/>
have gone out of my way to accomodate his kinesthetic style of<br/>
learning.  We do an online reading program that is completely<br/>
interactive and the math program that I use is montessori based.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Why are you looking to unschool? What do you think is so great about <br/>
it? You don&#39;t believe it---that learning happens naturally. Why are you <br/>
clinging to unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
If you truly believe he needs to be reading at seven, buy the <br/>
curriculum, work with him every day, and believe you&#39;re teaching him to <br/>
read.<br/>
<br/>
Seriously.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t for everyone. Way too many parents believe that <br/>
reading and math programs will work. If you do, DO it. You really don&#39;t <br/>
have to unchool. There are zillions of curricula out there---there are <br/>
even public and private and parochial and Montessoori and <br/>
Waldorf/Steiner---all KINDS of schools as options. Unschooling may not <br/>
be the option for you.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
IF he was a little more motivated to do SOMETHING, ANYTHING to learn<br/>
to read and better understand math, I would not feel pressured to<br/>
carve out time (which is MAYBE an hour a day) to do these subjects.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And I guess if you were a little more motivated to learn about <br/>
unschooling it would be working for you already. You&#39;re not ready.<br/>
<br/>
I could push you and push you. I could make you read articles and <br/>
websites and books and elists and message boards and books and blogs. <br/>
But if you aren&#39;t motivated, it just doesn&#39;t matter how hard I push, <br/>
does it? I could make it fun: I could make it interactive! I could <br/>
print articles on brightly colored paper. We could talk about it while <br/>
we jogged or swam or gardened. Would that make it more palatable? We <br/>
could make it a computer game: I give multiple choice or true/false <br/>
questions---and gold stars for the right answers. Would that make you <br/>
learn about unschooling faster? I could compare you to other moms who <br/>
figured it out faster---accelerated unschoolers! Or put you in the <br/>

<br/>
Learning doesn&#39;t happen like that. *YOU* must be the motivated party. <br/>
He&#39;s not motivated yet---which means he&#39;s not ready.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s only seven. When he&#39;s ten and still struggling, what will you do? <br/>
Send him to experts?<br/>
<br/>
When he&#39;s ten and reading, will you congratulate yourself for having <br/>
taught him to read?<br/>
<br/>
Did you do that when he learned to walk? You *did* teach him to walk, <br/>
right? Right at 12 months?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>

Really, I feel pressure to make sure that he learns certain things.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Hey Tyra,<br/>
<br/>
I also have a darling hubbie who is quite traditional in his ideas about<br/>
schoolwork, etc. Fortunately, like you, I have still got pretty much a free<br/>
rein in how I home ed and my hubbie is mostly happy with it all. We do work<br/>
out of or use reference texts every now and then.<br/>
<br/>
I wondered if this suggestion might help - if you got practiced at deciphering<br/>
and recording the learning that was going on in whatever area it was happening,<br/>
you can still present your hubbie with the subjects done, they would just<br/>
be getting done in an experiential/hands-on way. You could take photos of<br/>
the activities and perhaps write in a quick description. If your son doesn&#39;t<br/>
want to write, maybe he might like to type a diary of weekly reflection.<br/>
Or you could ask if it&#39;s okay to type up something you discussed together,<br/>
etc. I find the only record keeping worth doing is for myself these days,<br/>
to reassure myself we ARE doing lots of great things. But it also comes in<br/>
handy for others to peruse and creates great familiy memories in the form<br/>
of photos and artwork.  Most stuff can be done in &#39;real-life&#39;, even maths.<br/>
There are some good websites out there for ideas.<br/>
<br/>
This is coming from having a son who has always hated doing &#39;schoolwork&#39;.<br/>
I have become quite flexible in how he learns and have found that I try to<br/>
create that environment as much as possible. I have also accepted that like<br/>
most of us, he learns in peaks and troughs and that when it looks lke nothing<br/>
is happening, he is probably reflecting and synthesising.<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there,<br/>
<br/>
Cathy.</div>

I was on the edge of my seat reading your reply to this one. It really spoke<br/>

to be brutally honest with myself about WHY I need to be controlling. There<br/>
are many parenting areas I feel secure and instinctively know I am doing<br/>
the right thing for my kids, but others, like in using anger and coercion,<br/>
where I am needing to grow so much. I love metaphor and storytelling as ways<br/>
to communicate knowledge, but there was something so great about your matter<br/>
of fact answers to each of Tyra&#39;s thoughts that really helped me.<br/>

Man, I am loving this group. I am hearing stuff straight forward and honest<br/>

it isn&#39;t until recently that I realised that I was sitting on the fence,<br/>

really quiet at the moment, lol). I know all of this stuff and most of me<br/>
was there INTELLECTUALLY, but I am only just starting to OWN the idea of<br/>
unschooling. Brilliant. <br/>

<br/>
Getting around to my questions: Are we normal? For those who are <br/>
more laidback in their approach to learning, what suggestions do you <br/>
have for helping me to go back to relaxing with a child who is not <br/>
schoolish? I remember a mother telling me that when her kids were <br/>
ages 5-7 they were hardest to homeschool because they are <br/>
transitioning from being self-centered (not in a bad way but based <br/>
on getting their needs met as an infant) to expanding their world <br/>
view a bit more. She said it was not her favorite time to <br/>
homeschool any of them. So for anyone, did you have a similar <br/>
experience during these ages? I guess I want to know if we are <br/>
normal and will just have to work through this?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to any for your wisdom and suggestions in advance!<br/>
<br/>
Peacefully,<br/>
Tyra in Murfreesboro<br/>

<br/>
Hey Tyra,<br/>
<br/>
I also have a darling hubbie who is quite traditional in his ideas about<br/>
schoolwork, etc. Fortunately, like you, I have still got pretty much a free<br/>
rein in how I home ed and my hubbie is mostly happy with it all. We do work<br/>
out of or use reference texts every now and then.<br/>
<br/>
I wondered if this suggestion might help - if you got practiced at deciphering<br/>
and recording the learning that was going on in whatever area it was happening,<br/>
you can still present your hubbie with the subjects done, they would just<br/>
be getting done in an experiential/hands-on way. You could take photos of<br/>
the activities and perhaps write in a quick description. If your son doesn&#39;t<br/>
want to write, maybe he might like to type a diary of weekly reflection.<br/>
Or you could ask if it&#39;s okay to type up something you discussed together,<br/>
etc. I find the only record keeping worth doing is for myself these days,<br/>
to reassure myself we ARE doing lots of great things. But it also comes in<br/>
handy for others to peruse and creates great familiy memories in the form<br/>
of photos and artwork.  Most stuff can be done in &#39;real-life&#39;, even maths.<br/>
There are some good websites out there for ideas.<br/>
<br/>
This is coming from having a son who has always hated doing &#39;schoolwork&#39;.<br/>
I have become quite flexible in how he learns and have found that I try to<br/>
create that environment as much as possible. I have also accepted that like<br/>
most of us, he learns in peaks and troughs and that when it looks lke nothing<br/>
is happening, he is probably reflecting and synthesising.<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there,<br/>
<br/>
Cathy.</div>

I got that feeling from some other comments you made. It could be<br/>
partly that you&#39;re a &quot;results&quot; oriented person. But there is also that<br/>
societal pressure to have a product, a result a SOMETHING to show for<br/>
our effort.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is very Zen-like. We aren&#39;t focused on any end result.<br/>
We&#39;re not looking for a product. It&#39;s about joy in the moment. Not<br/>
very Western is it?:)<br/>
<br/>
Being IN the moment with your child, seeing their joy, doing an<br/>
activity just because it&#39;s ENJOYABLE and knowing that it has<br/>
value....that&#39;s the trust of unschooling. If you really think about<br/>
the way we learn best (the &quot;we&quot; being adults), that same freedom<br/>
applies to kids. We have the freedom to stop or start something at<br/>
will. We have the freedom to learn whatever we choose, whenever we<br/>
choose with whatever tools we want to use. Kids should have that same<br/>
freedom, without anyone adding stress to the process by looking for<br/>
any result.<br/>
<br/>
I would get pretty frustrated with my dh if he was judging or grading<br/>
my art or my knitting or my writing.  I do those things for the joy of<br/>
it. When I want input, I ask for it. OTherwish I&#39;m free to do as much<br/>
or little as I choose.<br/>
<br/>
I really believe John Holt hit the nail on the head when he said &quot;In<br/>
order to trust the children, we must first learn to trust ourselves.&quot;<br/>
That&#39;s what it&#39;s all about, isn&#39;t it?<br/>

my now 7 yo dd.......I also am preparing my letter of intent and my<br/>
educational plan......all of these things have been requested by my<br/>
district, and falls withing massachusetts law for them to require<br/>
it......sooo my question to you is.......do you live in a state like I<br/>
do where you have to report to the school on your child&#39;s progress?<br/>
and how do you do this as an unschooler.  I wonder how I will continue<br/>
to show progress reports which may not fit the school&#39;s timeline for<br/>
what should happen at each &quot;grade&quot;.<br/>

OK, this seems likely to be true based  on  our experiences since we started trying to radically unschool in March 2007.   I have many more questions, and hope that I get to fire off a longer field report but this exchange touches on one area of concern for me. While I am getting deschooled, and so inherently cannot really unschool actively, how do I best help the kids?  In this exchange someting like this was said, &quot;You were not unschooling but were doing your own thing and letting him do his.&quot;  I can&#39;t quote it as I accidently erased it.  Darn.  But we are in the midst of deschooling and er...yep, I am still tring to do my best at even that!  I hope that this quetion is decipherable. Thanks..Cameron<br/>

<br/>
YOu don&#39;t need to in MA. There are several here that can answer more<br/>
clearly.<br/>
<br/>
In FL, you only had to prove that your child had &quot;progressed&quot;. Well,<br/>
they&#39;re learning more all the time, so there is not way they wouldn&#39;t<br/>
progress! There is NO need to think that you need to follow any school<br/>
timeline.<br/>
<br/>
There are usually other options for meeting the law that don&#39;t include<br/>

<br/>
We learn that trust WORKS. We learn that we can let go and still be<br/>

fear, we heal. Through that healing we deschool and unschooling can<br/>
blossom more fully. It&#39;s a process. Nobody needs to deschool before<br/>
they unschool...but unschooling will flow freely and beautifully once<br/>
you have gotten most of the school out of your head!:)<br/>

this is a great example. May I quote you on our local list and/or my  <br/>
blog?<br/>
<br/>
Our deschooling period was less about the kids and more about me. Dh  <br/>
calls it the &quot;period of benign neglect&quot; because what it consisted of  <br/>
was ME biting my tongue and relearning all the parenting and  <br/>
expectations I had been brainwashed into believing. I had to step  <br/>
back, be an observer, safety monitor, etc. As my trust grew, then we  <br/>
were able to get more active together...but before that it would have  <br/>
built a big wall of distrust between us because I could not let go of  <br/>
all the other stuff. Oddly enough academics has never been an issue  <br/>
for me, but all the other stuff started that way.<br/>

to show progress reports which may not fit the school&#39;s timeline for<br/>
what should happen at each &quot;grade&quot;.~~&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;YOu don&#39;t need to in MA. There are several here that can answer more<br/>

<br/>
The reason I asked is because in the Charles case law here....it<br/>
states the school may require periodic evaluation to ensure<br/>
educational progress and minimum standards. I guess I assumed the<br/>
minimum standards meant progressing thru minimum standards for each<br/>
grade level.<br/>
So thats why I was wondering how an unschooler reports.<br/>
Last school year was the first I had to submit anything and this is<br/>
the first progress report I have had to do. I am sure I will get<br/>
better at the educationalese lingo to make the school &quot;happy&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1546137507">Hi everyone,<br/>
my son is turning 6 in August and so I wrote a short<br/>
letter of intent listing general subjects we will most<br/>
likely cover by just living and also saying that we<br/>
will most likely meet or surpass the hours required by<br/>
law because we believe that learning happens all day -<br/>
Now this is part of his response:<br/>
<br/>
Quote: Although you have listed the subjects you will<br/>
be teaching, I ask that you please provide us with<br/>
more information, such as the materials you are<br/>
planning to use in the various subject areas, the<br/>
number of hours of intstruction you plan to provide,<br/>
and how you will monitor L.&#39; progress. <br/>
After reviewing this information, I&#39;ll be happpy to<br/>
grant approval.<br/>
<br/>
In reality of course there wont be &#39;any&#39; hours of<br/>
instruction. He is learning all the time and I deaply<br/>
believe that teaching and learning have nothing to do<br/>
with each other, unless someone seeks out a &#39;teacher&#39;.<br/>
 The materials of course will vary and I can not know<br/>
all the things he might like to know about the coming<br/>
year. I could take a wild guess, or I could copy some<br/>
overview of a random curriculum and say that we might<br/>
be doing some of those things -<br/>
How do I monitor his progress? I do not like to look<br/>
at my child in that way - of course he makes<br/>
&#39;progress&#39; - maybe I could just say that I plan to<br/>
keep a diary of what we do during the day, and that<br/>
would be enough to realize his progress. I so hate<br/>
that word. <br/>
How do I deal with him and this letter as this is only<br/>
my first year of having to report? Any ideas? And what<br/>
exactly is an umbrella school?<br/>
<br/>
Lots of love to you all -<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-753205444">Schools destroy the spirits and damage the intellects of countless young boys <br/>
by insisting that they sit still and think at the same time, which very many <br/>
are simply not capable of doing. Parents at home can destroy spirits too. An <br/>
hour a day is WAY too much to ask of many many MANY young children.<br/>
<br/>
Being not even seven and not yet reading is NOTNOTNOT being a late reader. <br/>
Not even close. NOT! This is really important! You can&#39;t force reading on a kid <br/>
who isn&#39;t ready, but you CAN convince them that they&#39;re broken and/or stupid <br/>
if you try. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling saved the spirits and intellects of my two youngest children. Had <br/>
they gone to school they would not have been succesful in school terms in <br/>
those all important early years. my son because at 5 and 6 and 7 and 8 he could <br/>
think well OR he could sit still, but not both at the same time. My daughter <br/>
because she is a visual thinker who learned to read late and slow. One would <br/>
have been labeled trouble and the other special grouped. Both would likely have <br/>
ended up feeling stupid and deficient. Instead they are confident and happy in <br/>
learning and life at 15. Lucky lucky them to be born into an already <br/>
unschooling home.<br/>
<br/>
At the very least, read Raymond Moore&#39;s Better Late than Early, for support <br/>
in not pushing any academics on young children.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OK, this seems likely to be true based  on  our experiences since we <br/>
started<br/>
<br/>
trying to radically unschool in March 2007.   I have many more <br/>
questions, and<br/>
<br/>
hope that I get to fire off a longer field report but this exchange <br/>
touches on<br/>
<br/>
one area of concern for me. While I am getting deschooled, and so <br/>
inherently<br/>
<br/>
cannot really unschool actively, how do I best help the kids?  In this <br/>
exchange<br/>
<br/>
someting like this was said, &quot;You were not unschooling but were doing <br/>
your own<br/>
<br/>
thing and letting him do his.&quot;  I can&#39;t quote it as I accidently erased <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I *think* I wrote: &quot;You weren&#39;t unschooling; you were letting him be <br/>
while you were busy with other things.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Darn.  But we are in the midst of deschooling and er...yep, I am still <br/>
tring to<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
do my best at even that!  I hope that this quetion is decipherable.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 I think I understand what you&#39;re asking! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To me, for adults, the DEschooling process is about four things: 1) <br/>
seeing that learning happens naturally to everyone around you, 2) <br/>
immersing your own self in something important (and including the <br/>
children if they want),  3) documenting your children&#39;s learning <br/>
*without* disturbing it, and 4) NOT nagging or teaching or worrying.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The original poster was busy moving and starting her own business---so <br/>
she was actively doing #2. But she wasn&#39;t doing #s 1, 3, or 4.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
#1 needs to be done often---and not just with your children. Ask <br/>
around---lots of people you know: how did you learn what you know? <br/>
Especially folks with interesting jobs. Where did they gain their <br/>
knowledge of what they&#39;re doing. In school? The only professions that <br/>
latch on to that &quot;book larnin&#39;&quot; with a passion are doctors and lawyers <br/>
(you&#39;re one, right Cameron?---that&#39;s got to be an impediment for you! <br/>
&lt;g&gt; &#39;Cause you and your colleagues really do believe in that &quot;skule <br/>
larnin&#39;.&quot;  But it can be done! &lt;G&gt;) That&#39;s take a little more effort on <br/>
your part<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ren has a test (ironic, huh?) that she gives at conferences. It&#39;s <br/>
*very* telling when you see how many hands go up and down. Ren, you <br/>
want to bring that here again?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
#2 is about finding a passion. Get involved in something that will take <br/>
your mind of nagging your children. SHOW your children what real <br/>
learning looks like. Doing something difficult is even better: that way <br/>
they get to see you fail a bit too! Duncan and I picked up fencing two <br/>
years ago. It was a lot of fun, but a LOT of work. Duncan enjoyed <br/>
seeing me get beaten by a child half my size! &lt;G&gt; (But she was GOOD!) <br/>
I&#39;d fence at home---just learning the steps and positions so he saw me <br/>
working towards my goal (Dunc wasn&#39;t as interested in doing the <br/>
homework).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I also keep bees: we&#39;ve had three swarms, but we&#39;ve also harvested lots <br/>
of honey. I garden, but it&#39;s a good thing we don&#39;t rely on my crops to <br/>
feed us---I&#39;m not all that good at producing bumper crops! &lt;g&gt; We cry <br/>
(and sometimes laugh) at my failures and revel in my successes. It&#39;s <br/>
good for children to see that the learning isn&#39;t spontaneous but is a <br/>
process. Too often children only see us be perfect: we don&#39;t burn <br/>
supper any more because we&#39;ve had a lot of practice making the meals we <br/>
serve. Make more &quot;strange&quot; suppers---experiment in the kitchen---and <br/>
maybe call Domino&#39;s when you fail.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Children desperately need to see their parents struggle to learn <br/>
something new. Otherwise they believe that we *came* this way! They <br/>
don&#39;t realize that were kids just they they are! That we&#39;ve *learned* <br/>
everything we know!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
#3: Write it down! Learn educationese. And learn how to translate what <br/>
your child is doing into educationese. Today, with their earned $$$ <br/>
(helping my parents move yesterday), Duncan and his friend Bo bought <br/>
new Bionicles. They put them together, posed them, took photos of them, <br/>
and thought up elaborate stories and adventures for them. They swam for <br/>
a few hours and played with the hose. They made banana-strawberries <br/>
smoothies. They played on the computer a bit---DeviantArt and WOW. We <br/>
all went out to eat at San Jose&#39;s---and Duncan spoke to our waiter in <br/>
Spanish (just por favor and gracias, but he spoke Spanish!). We all <br/>
watched South Park and then baked cookies. They&#39;re upstairs now <br/>
talking, playing with their Bionicles, and watching a movie.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Based on that day, would anyone like to attempt a daily log of <br/>
educationese?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My (required by law) daily log (just a week-at-a-glance daytimer) looks <br/>
like this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Bo here / smoothies / New Bionicles / swim party / WOW / San Jose&#39;s / <br/>
South Park / cookies&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It lets me know what we did so that I can apply educationese if I need <br/>
to.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s absolutely no need for Duncan to know what I write down, but it <br/>
can help me see what he&#39;s doing daily---that he&#39;s not just &quot;doing <br/>
nothing&quot; all day.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
#4 The rule of thumb is one month for each year you were in school. How <br/>
many years were *you* schooled? Including kindergarten and college?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As for your children: IF you nag or push or try to &quot;teach&quot; something, <br/>
start counting over. So if you&#39;ve been good for four months but <br/>
suddenly have a panic attack and pull out the workbooks and ask for <br/>
three pages of math, you get to start deschooling all over. The reason <br/>
is that you&#39;ve lost the trust your child was just beginning to build in <br/>
you. Start over. You;re back at Day One.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If your child has been schooled or schooled-at-home, he needs to heal <br/>
first before he can even begin to trust you again (Is Mom going to <br/>
start with that damned Saxon Math again?) . He may need months of video <br/>
games or TV or walking the hills and star-gazing or just veging out to <br/>
simply heal himself from the damage of others&#39; lack of trust in him. As <br/>
he comes out of this funk, you&#39;ll see him searching for a passion. It <br/>
may not be the one *you* would like him to develop! &lt;G&gt; And I seriously <br/>
doubt it will look much like quadratic equations or Baroque <br/>
architecture or memorizing the periodic table or the laws of physics!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It *may* look like skateboarding or getting his first checkbook or <br/>
film-making or doll design or Bionicles. FEED that passion---it&#39;s your <br/>
first step in that new respect/trust bond you&#39;re seeking! No matter how <br/>
weird and &quot;non-schoolish&quot; it may seem. Roll with it. Put $$$ towards <br/>
it---at least what you would put into a new curriculum! As his trust in <br/>
you developed, so will his passions grow. EVERY passion will cover all <br/>
school subjects.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Toss one at me. I bet I could build a curriculum around it!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When the deschooling process is over, there will be a paradigm shift: <br/>
you will SEE all learning as natural and everywhere. You will naturally <br/>
relax about the reading and math---and even physics, history and <br/>
chemistry. And you won&#39;t worry any more.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One more thing: If you DO make that paradigm shift, then there&#39;s no <br/>
turning back. You KNOW! It&#39;s deep in your soul that this is RIGHT. That <br/>
unschooling is the ONLY way to learn. That nothing else makes sense.<br/>

In this homeschool-fearful country, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s  how I&#39;d start <br/>
*any*thing with the Superintendent! Especially with all the press <br/>

Try this. This is Duncan&#39;s &quot;curriculum&quot;---I borrowed it from Carol <br/>

<br/>
~The World is Our Classroom~<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
 LifeWorks School for Boys<br/>
<br/>
Course of Study<br/>
Elementary Grades<br/>
<br/>
LifeWorks School for Boys is a private full-time  homeschool <br/>
established in compliance with the Education Code of the State of South <br/>
Carolina. Because we believe that the family is the most fundamental <br/>
social institution and the preferred means of caring for, preparing, <br/>
and training children to be productive members of society, LifeWorks <br/>
School promotes and supports a family-centered education through our <br/>
independent study program.<br/>
<br/>
At LifeWorks School, independent study, in which Duncan learns <br/>
primarily under the immediate direction, guidance, and support of his <br/>
parents and other caring and involved adults, offers an outstanding <br/>
educational opportunity by providing a natural learning environment, <br/>
extensive real-world experience, flexibility of schedule, and the <br/>
ability to respond to the specific needs and inclinations of the child. <br/>
Duncan’s program is developmentally appropriate, integrated and fully <br/>
individualized, and continually built upon his strengths and interests <br/>
throughout the year.<br/>
<br/>
English: Duncan will develop knowledge of, and appreciation for <br/>
literature and the language, as well as the skills of speaking, <br/>
reading, comprehension, listening, spelling, handwriting, and <br/>
composition.<br/>
<br/>
Duncan will read from self-chosen or parent-chosen literature on a <br/>
regular basis and will engage in reflection on those literature pieces <br/>
in a variety of ways, such as: journal writing, book reviews, <br/>
conversations, drama based on the books, book clubs. Our educational <br/>
goal is for Duncan to read for pleasure, to gain exposure to a wide <br/>
variety of genres, and to be able to reflect critically on what he <br/>
reads.<br/>
<br/>
Duncan will read content-related non-fiction materials to support his <br/>
chosen areas of interest. He will reflect on these pieces in a variety <br/>
of ways, such as: journal writing, writing articles for submission to <br/>
magazines or newspapers, discussions, or development of a scrapbook in <br/>
an area of interest. Our goal is for Duncan to learn to read critically <br/>
for information, to understand and be able to reflect on materials <br/>
read, to be able to compare them to other sources of information, and <br/>
to learn how and where to find written resources as needed.<br/>
<br/>
Writing, spelling and grammar will be covered as part of Duncan’s <br/>
natural writing and speaking processes. He will develop his ability to <br/>
write creatively, to write letters and lists, to create and write drama <br/>
pieces, informational essays, persuasive articles, etc. Our goal is for <br/>
Duncan to enjoy writing, to gain expertise in both the writing process <br/>
and in technical writing and editing skills, and to develop a sense of <br/>
power over the written word<br/>
<br/>
Science:  Duncan will develop his knowledge of the biological and <br/>
physical sciences, with emphasis on the processes of experimental <br/>
inquiry and on the place of humans in ecological systems. He will <br/>
relate these to areas of specific personal interests by engaging in <br/>
hands-on activities, watching science videos, reading related written <br/>
materials, conducting scientific experiments, keeping journals, making <br/>
and recording observations, visiting scientists in their work places, <br/>
visiting local science museums, participating in science fairs and <br/>
workshops, and through cooperative learning. Our goal is for Duncan to <br/>
experience a wide range of scientific exposure, to develop a positive <br/>
interest in science, to learn to think scientifically, to develop a <br/>
respect for the work scientists do, and to understand the importance <br/>
science has in daily life and in the overall environment.<br/>
<br/>
Social Sciences: Duncan will develop his understanding of the social <br/>
sciences and humanities by reading and discussing fiction and <br/>
non-fiction materials, participating in field trips to historic and <br/>
politically or culturally significant sites, or through discussion and <br/>
debate. Anthropology, economics, psychology, geography, history, <br/>
political science, and sociology are fully integrated into his studies <br/>
in a wide variety of ways, such as: the use of time lines and maps, <br/>
discussion, journal writing, cooking, plays, road trips, invention <br/>
building, field trips, and art. Our goal is for Duncan to develop a <br/>
foundation for understanding the history, resources, development, and <br/>
government of South Carolina and the United States of America; the <br/>
development of the American economic system including the role of the <br/>
entrepreneur and labor; the relations of persons to their human and <br/>
natural environment; eastern and western cultures and civilizations; <br/>
and contemporary issues including the wise use of natural resources. <br/>
Public service and selfless giving play an important role in our <br/>
family&#39;s social studies.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Health and Physical Education: Health and physical education will be <br/>
fully integrated as a part of daily living skills and participation in <br/>
the wider community with an emphasis upon the physical activities that <br/>
my be conducive to health and vigor of body and mind. Duncan will learn <br/>
to care for his health and physical environment in a variety of ways, <br/>
such as: shopping for and preparing food, discussing the necessity of a <br/>
healthy diet, participation in fire drills and other emergency <br/>
preparedness activities, exercise both as play and as part of a <br/>
structured group experience and through camping, hiking, and other <br/>
outdoor activity. Our goal is for Duncan to appreciate the necessity of <br/>
a healthy body and to develop lifelong habits of regular exercise and <br/>
good nutrition.<br/>
<br/>
Visual and Performing Arts: Duncan will develop his knowledge of art, <br/>
music, and drama through informal and structured methods in a variety <br/>
of ways, such as: art classes, instrumental lessons, choral singing, <br/>
listening to various styles of music, learning about the people who <br/>
have influenced music through history, or working on individualized or <br/>
group projects that relate to music, art, and drama, including acting <br/>
and performing in a variety of venues and genres.  Our goal is for <br/>
Duncan to enjoy a wide variety of art, music, and drama experiences, <br/>
including performance, while developing an understanding and <br/>
appreciation of the importance of art, music, and drama as creative <br/>
expressions of human life experiences.<br/>
<br/>
Mathematics: Duncan will develop mathematical concepts, operational <br/>
skills, and problem solving through participation in daily real-world <br/>
activities such as cooking, building, shopping, budgeting, computing, <br/>
etc. Mathematics materials will be chosen to support his individual <br/>
learning style in order to achieve competency in operational skills and <br/>
insight into problem-solving procedures.  Our goal is for Duncan to <br/>
gain a strong conceptual knowledge of mathematics as well as an <br/>
appreciation for the daily applications of mathematics in his life.<br/>

How do I monitor his progress? I do not like to look<br/>
at my child in that way - of course he makes<br/>
&#39;progress&#39; - maybe I could just say that I plan to<br/>
keep a diary of what we do during the day, and that<br/>
would be enough to realize his progress. I so hate<br/>
that word.<br/>
How do I deal with him and this letter as this is only<br/>
my first year of having to report? Any ideas? And what<br/>
exactly is an umbrella school?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I would say that I will keep a portfolio of samples of his work and a <br/>
daytimer in which I&#39;d write what we do each day (you only need 180 <br/>
days/year.<br/>
