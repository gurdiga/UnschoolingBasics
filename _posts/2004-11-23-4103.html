<div id="ygrps-yiv-241172482">Another story related to the discussion...<br/>
Earlier this year Markus and I were cleaning up the yard. Sierra had <br/>
come out to help, and he grabbed an old kiddie pool and suggested <br/>
trying to make baskets with the pine cones (to make the clean up <br/>
more fun).<br/>
This proceeded nicely and pretty soon Jalen and Jared had ventured <br/>
out and decided it looked fun. After getting a small section of the <br/>
yard looking nice, Jared was totally inspired. He stayed and help <br/>
rake for over an hour and started talking about cleaning up another <br/>
area, planting things and creating a little oasis.<br/>
We all sat down for a break. He was sweaty and dirty, but smiling.<br/>
He said &quot;This is fun, I like working in the yard. When you and Dad <br/>
made us do it, I hated it, but when you can choose to do it, it&#39;s <br/>
fun.&quot;<br/>
Words of wisdom from my (then) 10y.o.<br/>
