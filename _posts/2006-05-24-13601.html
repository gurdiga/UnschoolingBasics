<div id="ygrps-yiv-1493940768">My dd (13) had been out of school for the first time since last <br/>
June.   She&#39;s still deschooling.   Up until this past week, she has <br/>
always wanted to end the day with our bedtime routine of saying <br/>
goodnight, she didn&#39;t like staying up on her own.  Even though I <br/>
don&#39;t usually have to get up early (this is MY first time not <br/>
working full time!) I have been finding that I just can&#39;t stay up <br/>
until 2, 3 or even 4AM, I can&#39;t make up for the sleep I need at the <br/>
other end by sleeping later like she does.   We talked about it and <br/>
I have been going to bed with her staying up on her own.   She&#39;s <br/>
been heavily into playing World of Warcraft online, and has <br/>
connected with quite a few of the other players, who are often on <br/>
late at night (many live is different time zones, so it&#39;s earlier in <br/>
the day for them).   She&#39;s struggled in the past making friends IRL, <br/>
and I know that these online connections are very important to her.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m supportive of her choices, however my dh is having a hard time <br/>
with this.   He&#39;s been agreeable about homeschooling, but really <br/>
doesn&#39;t understand unschooling.  Plus, he sleeps in the room right <br/>
next to hers (his snoring has intensified over the past year, and he <br/>
keeps me awake when we sleep in the same room!) so since he gets up <br/>
early to go to work, has agreed to sleep in a different room.  He <br/>
hears her computer (and sometimes she has the TV on, which is <br/>
against the wall of the room he&#39;s in  she and I talked about how <br/>
she needs to be respectful and keep it down, but I don&#39;t think she <br/>
realizes how loud it can sometimes be, and doesn&#39;t self regulate the <br/>
level) and it wakes him up.   I suggested he get up and ask her to <br/>
turn it down, but that hasn&#39;t happened, he usually complains to me <br/>
the next day, saying it isn&#39;t &quot;normal&quot; for her to be up so late <br/>
etc.  (some of this, I think, is that he is resentful of having to <br/>
get up early, NONE of us are morning people, and he&#39;d really rather <br/>
not have to!   But he does it).<br/>
<br/>
I suggested that we all sit down tonight to discuss this.  The <br/>
problem is that he tends to be negative, coming out with statements <br/>
like &quot;you need to go to bed!&quot; etc in a tone of voice that is <br/>
demanding.  I&#39;ve tried talking to him about how allowing her to make <br/>
her own choices isn&#39;t hurting anyone, and how it&#39;s an important part <br/>
of unschooling, but he doesn&#39;t see it that way.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, we&#39;re going to the conference this weekend (well, he&#39;s at least <br/>
agreed to go to Ben&#39;s dad&#39;s group) but I&#39;m not sure how much he&#39;ll <br/>
actually stick around for (we only live 15 mins from the hotel and I <br/>
couldn&#39;t convince him to stay there, he isn&#39;t willing to give up <br/>
his &quot;weekend&quot; off  sigh).   I&#39;m really looking forward to meeting <br/>
so many that I&#39;ve come to know here and on other groups, and to be <br/>
with like minded folks!<br/>
<br/>
I sure could use some suggestions and/or words of wisdom.   He&#39;s not <br/>
a reader, so forget book suggestions, although I have sent him links <br/>
to articles from time to time (do any come to mind from those of you <br/>
who have been doing this a lot longer than we have?!).<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think the first thing that needs to happen is <br/>
that your daughter needs to understand how <br/>
important it is that her pursuit of happiness <br/>
doesn&#39;t infringe on anyone else&#39;s.  Perhaps the <br/>
conversation you all have tonight could be <br/>
brainstorming ways that your daughter can do her <br/>
thing (play on her &#39;puter and watch the tube) and <br/>
your husband can do his (have uninterrupted <br/>
sleep).  Both are valid and good and neither <br/>
should have to give up one for the other.  Maybe <br/>
she can use headphones for the computer and the <br/>
TV after your husband goes to bed.  Maybe the <br/>
computer can be located in a different part of <br/>
the room so it&#39;s not adjacent to your husband&#39;s <br/>
sleeping space.  At any rate, she needs to <br/>
understand fully that she shouldn&#39;t be disturbing <br/>
anyone&#39;s sleep.  It&#39;s just not the right thing to do!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I suggested he get up and ask her to<br/>
&gt;turn it down, but that hasn&#39;t happened, he usually complains to me<br/>
&gt;the next day, saying it isn&#39;t &quot;normal&quot; for her to be up so late<br/>
&gt;etc.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He really should not have to get up in the night <br/>
to ask her to turn it down.  I would really feel <br/>
pissed off if I had to do that were I in his <br/>
shoes, and I might say all kinds of mean, nasty <br/>
things I don&#39;t mean!  I gotta tell ya, I really <br/>
and truly don&#39;t mind if my son stays up the whole <br/>
night (he has on many occasions); he just needs <br/>
to respect my need for sleep the way I do his.<br/>
<br/>
I bet if your husband feels that his needs are <br/>
being considered, it may help the situation <br/>
greatly.  It will also help for your daughter in <br/>
many ways to feel that she&#39;s part of the <br/>
solution.  The alternative of her not playing at <br/>
night could only breed resentment, which is <br/>
partly what your husband is probably feeling now.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;(some of this, I think, is that he is resentful of having to<br/>
&gt;get up early...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And some of it may be that he&#39;s feeling like his <br/>
needs aren&#39;t being considered.  I can really understand how he&#39;s feeling.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I&#39;ve tried talking to him about how allowing her to make<br/>
&gt;her own choices isn&#39;t hurting anyone, and how it&#39;s an important part<br/>
&gt;of unschooling, but he doesn&#39;t see it that way.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But, in this case, her choices are &quot;hurting&quot; <br/>
someone.  Him!  Not a good idea if you&#39;re trying to get his support!  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that&#39;s the first thing that pops into me <br/>
head.  I hope it&#39;s a little helpful!<br/>
<br/>
See ya this weekend!!!<br/>

are wireless ones that cost $40 or less. (In fact, we&#39;re going to  <br/>

living in our own 4-bedroom house for years and now in a huge  <br/>

it harder to get back to sleep and then the noise in the background  <br/>
is just MORE annoying. So I understand why he doesn&#39;t want to have to  <br/>
get up and ask her to turn it down.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve asked my husband not to complain to me about the kids. He still  <br/>
does it once in a while and I just say, &quot;Is there something specific  <br/>
you&#39;re asking me to do?&quot; If he said, &quot;I want you to make her go to  <br/>
bed,&quot; then we could talk about that - but I won&#39;t listen to him  <br/>
whining on about them just for the sake of venting because he&#39;s too  <br/>
prone to get negative and focus on faults and not ever notice the  <br/>
wonderful amazing people they really are.<br/>

&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nhen.org/teens/default.asp?id=2">http://www.nhen.org/teens/default.asp?id=2</a>&gt;<br/>
that explain why teens naturally gravitate toward staying awake until  <br/>
the wee hours of the morning.<br/>
<br/>
  Page down to the VERY bottom - it is the last set of articles on a  <br/>
long page.<br/>
<br/>
He might be more understanding if he understands the chemistry of  <br/>
sleep - that there are physiological reasons teenagers tend to stay  <br/>
up really late and sleep late the next day.<br/>

how that affects our ability to discuss things.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So - will he read more? Will he just trust you? I remind my husband  <br/>
that &quot;I&quot; was an American girl - &quot;he&quot; was neither a girl nor an  <br/>
American, so maybe he needs to trust me when I tell him how he&#39;s  <br/>
coming across to the girls. I&#39;m more an expert than he is - and that  <br/>
makes some sense to him - he&#39;s willing to take advice from an  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>disturbing anyone&#39;s sleep.  It&#39;s just not the right thing to do!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We talked about using headphones, she&#39;s going to try that.  She DOES <br/>
understand, just didn&#39;t realize that the sound was carrying so <br/>
much.  When I was staying up late with her I would remind her to <br/>
turn it down a bit if need be, but when it&#39;s just her she gets <br/>
absorbed and doesn&#39;t think about it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I would really feel pissed off if I had to do that were I in his <br/>

mean!  And some of it may be that he&#39;s feeling like his needs aren&#39;t <br/>
being considered.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t really think about it that way, you&#39;re right, I&#39;m not <br/>
respecting HIS needs at all!  Mean and nasty because he was woken up <br/>
is understandable, it&#39;s when he&#39;s awake at other times and doesn&#39;t <br/>
realize how his tone can be a turn off (been there, done that!) that <br/>
can makes communicating effectively difficult.<br/>
We both tend to react to conflict in the same way as when we were <br/>
growing up (combative and defensive).  Neither of us had the kind of <br/>
support where we were really &quot;heard&quot; and I work very hard at being <br/>
respectful of my daughter, but I sometimes don&#39;t do as much as I can <br/>
for my husband, because I&#39;m responding on an emotional level, <br/>
anticipating his negativity.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond this is the issue that he thinks she should be going to sleep <br/>
earlier, &quot;it&#39;s not normal&quot; etc.   I need to think some more on this <br/>
part.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I bet if your husband feels that his needs are being considered, <br/>

alternative of her not playing at night could only breed resentment, <br/>
which is partly what your husband is probably feeling now.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I DO want her to feel she&#39;s part of the solution, not just being <br/>
told she needs to go to bed earlier because he is bothered by it <br/>
(one of his balloons).   NOT playing at night is not an option for <br/>
the reason you state above!   I don&#39;t have problem with her staying <br/>
up at all.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I&#39;ve tried talking to him about how allowing her to make her own <br/>

 </span></blockquote>good idea if you&#39;re trying to get his support!  ;-)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Again, you&#39;re right.   What I wrote is partially true, but I didn&#39;t <br/>
finish the connection.  Staying up late isn&#39;t going to turn her into <br/>
a useless human being (is what I meant) but didn&#39;t take it one step <br/>
further in that if she&#39;s making enough sound to disturb his sleep, <br/>
then it IS hurting him.  Respect goes both ways.  I can really see <br/>
how it has improved things between my dd and I.  We need to work <br/>
harder on including dad more (sometimes it&#39;s hard when he doesn&#39;t <br/>
want to meet us half way though!)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your input Marji, I really appreciate it.   Looking <br/>
forward to meeting you!<br/>

Oddly enough, he has his radio on all night (he likes the &quot;noise&quot; in <br/>
the background, his own version of &quot;white noise&quot;), another reason we <br/>
don&#39;t do well sleeping in the same room!.  So, in a way I find it <br/>
odd that he&#39;s even hearing the sound from her room  makes me wonder <br/>
if a lot of it is more that he wakes up to use the bathroom, <br/>
realizes she&#39;s still up and is bothered because &quot;it&#39;s not normal&quot;.   <br/>
(and he usually falls to sleep VERY quickly, even after getting up, <br/>
so not sure about that either).<br/>

Boy, you could have written this about my dh!   I&#39;ll have to try <br/>
asking if he has a specific request.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen the info on the nhen site (sent it to him at work.... <br/>
we&#39;ll see if he checks it out, he usually does if it&#39;s not too <br/>
lengthy!)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;My husband, too. And he genuinely doesn&#39;t seem to be able to &quot;get&quot;<br/>

Glad to hear it&#39;s not just here (of course, I know I&#39;m not the only <br/>
one with a dh who isn&#39;t totally on-board!).  He has 3 older <br/>
brothers, and his mother was VERY intrusive and nagging.  We&#39;ve <br/>
talked MANY times about all of this, but I wish he would try harder <br/>
to approach his relationship with his daughter in a more respectful <br/>
way, instead of &quot;playing the old tapes&quot;.   And I know I have to try <br/>
harder to be more respectful of him, even though he still has his <br/>
own issues surrounding trust and self-worth.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If he&#39;s open to the idea of talking and of being challenged, like we <br/>
are on this list, you could ask him how his sleep patterns would be <br/>
different if he didn&#39;t have to wake up early for work.  What if his <br/>
hours changed and he could work 11am to 7pm or something <br/>
hypothetical.  Would he still think it was important to go to bed at <br/>
a certain time and wake up early to begin his day?  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve just had this conversation with my DH and children.  My DH <br/>
didn&#39;t mind the change in bedtimes at first but did grow concerned <br/>
after a while.  He was worried about their health.  But I pointed <br/>
out that our children get more sleep than he does because there is <br/>
no particular reason to wake them up so early.  However, when we do <br/>
need to wake up to do something particular, they aren&#39;t dragging, <br/>
grumpy and whining.  It&#39;s usually an activity of their choice or <br/>
something truly necessary that they don&#39;t mind waking up for.  <br/>
<br/>
One change I might suggest is the location of everyone&#39;s sleeping <br/>
places.  Since you and he sleep in different rooms, is it possible <br/>
to change places so that he&#39;s not near your daughter&#39;s room and late <br/>
night noises?  In our house, our kids rooms are directly across from <br/>
our bedroom, so they do not play in their bedrooms after we&#39;ve gone <br/>
to sleep.  They are either in the living room or downstairs in my <br/>
dd14&#39;s room.  Then when they do go to bed, they are quiet and we <br/>
often sleep right through them getting into pjs, brushing teeth, <br/>
etc.  Now that my DH isn&#39;t getting disturbed anymore, he&#39;s not <br/>
concerned about our children staying up late anymore.<br/>

what she wants to do with her life, then she will make the changes <br/>
necessary!  And because this is so new to us, she&#39;s still <br/>

chronic back pain, the bed we have now is the best I can tolerate, <br/>
the bed (futon) in the room that dh is sleeping on would not be a <br/>
good choice for me.   I DID consider that switching would be ideal, <br/>
but it won&#39;t work in this case.<br/>

My dd was more aware last night of the volume and dh said he didn&#39;t <br/>
notice it, so, for now, it&#39;s working out.<br/>

&gt; get up or change her sleep habits.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I&#39;ve heard the argument.  Let&#39;s see...<br/>
<br/>
1. Children need to wake up early to go to school even if they are <br/>
homeschooled because we have to help them form the habit so when <br/>
they become adults they&#39;ll know how to wake up on time when they <br/>
have jobs.<br/>
<br/>
2. Kids are healthier when they go to bed early and wake up early.<br/>
<br/>
3. Our forefathers used to wake/work/sleep with the sun&#39;s pattern.  <br/>
They woke up at dawn and went to bed at dusk.  We&#39;d be better <br/>
workers if we kept that tradition.<br/>
<br/>
Those are the first three off the top of my head.  *laugh*  Before I <br/>
became a college student, I worked at the university.  One of the <br/>
first things I learned was that morning classes were the least <br/>
popular among students and professors.  Very few people wanted to go <br/>
to bed early and wake up early if they didn&#39;t have to do so.  Since <br/>
becoming a homeschooling parent and hearing this argument that our <br/>
children won&#39;t know how to wake up early if we don&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; them, <br/>
I&#39;ve often wondered how long it takes to undo that teaching.  If a <br/>
college student spends all his/her time taking afternoon classes and <br/>
never waking up early, will his conditioning from childhood kick <br/>
back in when they graduate and have to work?  Was there ever <br/>
conditioning?  Or was it just a control that parents insist on <br/>
because it&#39;s the parent-y kind of thing to do?  Couldn&#39;t the <br/>
student, child, adult, etc. now be motivated to get up early in <br/>
their anticipation or obligation of responsibility of going to work?<br/>
<br/>
In helping your DH see this, ask him if the only reason he wakes up <br/>
in the morning to go to work is because his mom and dad forced him <br/>
to keep those &#39;normal&#39; hours?  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Please forgive me if this comes across as stupid, but can&#39;t the beds <br/>
be moved?  I mean, not that I&#39;m saying you have to change, but just <br/>
to throw the idea out there.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re tossing around ideas for our own family right now.  My dd14 <br/>
has the huge bedroom downstairs.  It&#39;s even larger than our master <br/>
suite!  But!!!, she doesn&#39;t have a bathroom.  We might switch with <br/>
her, giving her the master suite, but we haven&#39;t yet decided what to <br/>
do.  The two younger kids are also kind of vying for that space.  <br/>
We&#39;re just trying to figure out how we would all best fit into this <br/>
home.  We&#39;re not a traditional family, obviously, so we don&#39;t really <br/>
care too much if we&#39;re in the master suite or not.  But we do care <br/>
about being near a bathroom because we&#39;re old and wake up in the <br/>
middle of the night.  *lol*<br/>

<br/>
The bed I&#39;m in is a kingsize and the master bedroom is the only one it <br/>
will fit in (we just built this house last year!).  The other bedrooms <br/>
are smaller, so, it&#39;s not feasible to move them around.  Not knowing <br/>
the layout we have, it&#39;s not a stupid question at all! Actually, as I <br/>
posted before, he sleeps with the radio on in his ear all night and <br/>
snores loud enough for me to hear him through the wall! (I have to run <br/>
a fan for white noise!), I think it&#39;s more that he wakes up to use the <br/>
bathroom and realizes she&#39;s still up, but I&#39;m not witnessing it to <br/>
know for sure.   No biggie, we&#39;re trying the headphones and dd being <br/>
more aware of the volume!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m hoping after this weekend at the conference (he&#39;s not going to all <br/>
of it, but agreed to some), that he&#39;ll get a better picture of <br/>
unschooling.  I&#39;m really looking forward to it, and to meeting so many <br/>
I&#39;ve only met in cyber space!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh!  That makes sense.  My dd8 would really like a queen bed, or at <br/>
least a double bed, but her bedroom is so tiny that she&#39;d lose all her <br/>
play space if we put a big bed in her room.  When she&#39;s a little <br/>
older, she might not mind that too much but she enjoys having her <br/>
space right now so has resigned herself to keep the twin size.  :)<br/>

My dd (13) has a queen sleigh bed now, we bought it last year when <br/>
shopping for new furniture for our room, she saw it and loved it, so <br/>
we said what the heck!   Before that she was using my old canopy bed <br/>
from when I was young (twin).   It DOES take up a good chunk of the <br/>
room, but now that she&#39;s older, play space has changed (to computer <br/>
and TV!) and she doesn&#39;t mind.<br/>
(Beth, I notice you&#39;re on &quot;shine&quot; too, both my dh and dd are HSPs!  <br/>
adds to the mix of working out this new life style, but never a dull <br/>
moment!  I&#39;m glad I found the info on HS, it&#39;s helped SO much knowing!)<br/>
