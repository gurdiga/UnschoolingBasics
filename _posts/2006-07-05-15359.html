<div id="ygrps-yiv-1826167696">Hi <br/>
I am the mother of five beautiful children, ages 18 months to 7 <br/>
years old. I have been homeschooling for 2 years.  I try to use a <br/>
combination of methods, but I am unsatisfied.  Many of the unschool-<br/>
ing parents we see are those with extravagant lifestyles.  Are there <br/>
any financially challenged people unschooling successfully?  My <br/>
husband and I want to learn to unschool.  We are operating on <br/>
limited resources, but we feel that home/unschooling is the only <br/>
option for our children. I know that unschooling is natural <br/>
learning, but how do you break free from traditional teaching <br/>
thinking and on a tight budget? <br/>
We don&#39;t have a lot of support for homeschooling.  My children are <br/>
constantly probed for information by others who disagree with our <br/>
decision to homeschool.  I want advice on how to deal with these <br/>
issues. Many of these people are family with whom we desire to <br/>
maintain a civil relationship. I know that I am making the best <br/>
choice for my children, but we have chosen the road less traveled. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your imput in advance.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-636276608">First thing is that since there&#39;s no curriculum or &quot;should know&quot; <br/>
stuff, you can use the money that you&#39;ve been using for &#39;school <br/>
stuff&#39; for whatever your family chooses to use it for (it may still <br/>
be some workbooks here and there even!)<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t say we have an &quot;extravagant&quot; lifestyle at all - we have one <br/>
income (mine), two paid for 8 year old vehicles, a mortgage, student <br/>
loans from DH&#39;s university days (he started after we&#39;d been married <br/>
two years and DS was born midway through) and the usual utilities <br/>
and such. Once the fixed expense stuff is paid, we decide what is <br/>
important that we want to use the discretionary part for. Sometimes <br/>
it&#39;s saving up for a trip to someplace we want to see and <br/>
experience. Sometimes it&#39;s just setting aside some funds to go to <br/>
the drive in when there&#39;s a movie we want to see. Sometimes it means <br/>
having the funds to buy the stuff to make really cheesy fondue (with <br/>
the good, expensive Ementhaler and Gruyere) with fresh artisan-type <br/>
breads and chocolate fondue with fresh strawberries and invite some <br/>
friends over. Sometimes it means putting funds aside to pick up the <br/>
just-released first season of the new Dr. Who series on DVD. It&#39;s <br/>
all good.<br/>
<br/>
Use the summer to drop all the &#39;school stuff&#39;. Just vacation and <br/>
enjoy being. When the weather starts to cool, keep on vacationing. <br/>
If you -want- to go out and buy new crayons and notebooks and stuff <br/>
because they&#39;re on sale, have fun. But you don&#39;t have to. No need to <br/>
prowl the bookstore and the Internet looking for the workbooks and <br/>
such that you &quot;need&quot; - you don&#39;t &quot;need&quot; them. Go to the library and <br/>
max out your library cards on stuff that catches your eye (the <br/>
collective you - all the members of the family). <br/>
<br/>
As far as people poking in - did you ask them when you had 5 <br/>
children? Did you allow them to question your decision with no <br/>
answer? Odds are you basically told them to butt out. Same applies <br/>
to homeschooling in all its forms - it&#39;s *your* choice for *your* <br/>
family. Politely tell them to either do the research you&#39;ve done or <br/>
stay out of it - it is not open to debate or unfounded opinion. <br/>
You&#39;ll gladly answer questions *once they&#39;ve done the amount of <br/>
research on the subject that you have*.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the people bothering your kids, you can do several things <br/>
(your choice): you can step in and deflect the questioning (&quot;I&#39;m <br/>
sorry to interrupt but Billy, could you please go get me a spoon. <br/>
Thanks so much.&quot; basically giving your child a polite excuse to <br/>
leave the presence of the pest); you can prime the kids with <br/>
something such as &quot;Gee you don&#39;t know that either? Let&#39;s go ask my <br/>
mom - she helps me find out answers when I have a question&quot;; you can <br/>
prime the kids with something like &quot;I don&#39;t know that yet (or answer <br/>
if they do know it). Do you know which Pokemon is the best to fight <br/>
a Fire type?&quot; (basically tossing a question in the child&#39;s area of <br/>
expertise back at the questioner).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found that the best defense is a good offense so I make sure to <br/>
keep a running stream of info flowing to the various extended family <br/>
members and friends - things we&#39;re doing, seeing, exploring. When we <br/>
talk about the TWO vacations we&#39;ve had this year before the rest of <br/>
the kids were even out of school, about picking berries in the back <br/>
yard (and DH showing DS how to tell the safe ones from the hazardous <br/>
ones, and where the poison ivy lives and all that) and then helping <br/>
make jam and frozen fruit pops (DS goes out every morning and picks <br/>
whatever is ripe - he&#39;s just hooked on harvesting fresh berries), <br/>
about how DS helped us build the raised boxes for our garden, <br/>
pictures of DS playing with other unschooled kids at a get-together <br/>
a few weeks ago, all that sort of stuff. Basically, we don&#39;t leave a <br/>
vacuum for questions to form - we are pro-actively filling in stuff <br/>
for the grandparents. And, it seems to be working - my parents have <br/>
been cutting out articles as they appear about kids who are <br/>
homeschooled AND unschooled and sending them to us with notes <br/>
like &quot;This makes a lot of sense&quot; and &quot;Sounds like what you&#39;re doing -<br/>
 looks pretty interesting&quot; <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>ROFLOL!!  Most of the families I know who are unschooling are not what<br/>
I would classify as having &quot;extravagant lifestyles!&quot;  Most of us are<br/>
living paycheck to paycheck and trying to make ends meet while we<br/>
provide for the needs and desires of our family!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First to learn to unschool you need to unschool yourself.  Stop giving<br/>
yourself limitations.  If you have a child that has an interest, by<br/>
doing a little research you are sure to find a way to make that<br/>
affordable for your budget.  There are all kinds of opportunities out<br/>
there for our kids.  Unschooling does not mean that you are going to<br/>
saturate them with everything possible.  It does mean that you are<br/>
going to find a way to let them experience the things that interest<br/>
them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One of the ways that I dealt with family members who thought I had<br/>
made a bad decision was to ask them, &quot;Do you not think that I would do<br/>
my best to provide for my children in the ways that they need?&quot;  I&#39;ve<br/>
also said to people, &quot;Prove to me that the way I am raising my<br/>
children is harmful.&quot;  Another thing you can say is, &quot;I appreciate<br/>
your concern for my children, but know that I have researched this and<br/>
am making the decisions I think are most beneficial for our family.&quot;<br/>
Of course my family already thinks I&#39;m crazy!<br/>
