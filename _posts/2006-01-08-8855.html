  Got it.  Well then I&#39;m -almost- a radical homeschooler.  We do <br/>
  impose a bedtime, in that they have to be in bed by a certain time, <br/>
  but they can play quietly with toys in their beds, but the bed time <br/>
  is more due to the house schedule so my husband can get his sleep <br/>
  for work and I can get work done at night for my paying job (I work <br/>
  freelance).<br/>
<br/>
  I am facing a current problem and would appreciate some insight.  My <br/>
  just turned 3 year old still isn&#39;t potty trained (egads! I know, but <br/>
  I&#39;m not a bad mom, really!).  He was speech delayed, but we&#39;re up to <br/>
  par now and working on articulation.  He is capable of going on the <br/>
  potty (has done so once or twice when he was at the preschool) and <br/>
  he can do his own clothes.  But I&#39;ve always felt he shouldn&#39;t be <br/>
  forced; he&#39;ll do it when he&#39;s ready.  But since I pulled him out of <br/>
  preschool this past October to homeschool, I ask if he wants to go <br/>
  sit on the potty and he politely declines.  I still don&#39;t want to <br/>
  force him, but I don&#39;t want him to be untrained at - oh, I don&#39;t <br/>
  know, 14!  How do I impose my desire for him to potty train and be <br/>
  true to the commitment I&#39;ve made to our family to unschool and try <br/>
  to maintain that in every aspect of our life?<br/>
<br/>
  He doesn&#39;t want to wear a pull-up.  Do I just wait til it&#39;s warmer <br/>
  and say, oh, sorry, we&#39;re out of diapers and let him figure out he <br/>
  doesn&#39;t want to be wet?<br/>
<br/>
  Sorry if this is too pedantic. It probably links with some of the <br/>
  other threads on control issues!<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks for listening and any input you may have.<br/>

  -by the way, as a brand new homeschooler and unschooler, we had the <br/>
  best day yesterday!  (My husband isn&#39;t convinced we accomplished <br/>
  anything, but I am!)  I drug out all of the musical instruments we <br/>
  have (sticks, play drum, triangles, you name it) and we <br/>
  made &quot;music.&quot;  My 5 yr old son discovered reverberation and wanted <br/>
  to see what made different vibrations.  It was awesome watching him <br/>
  try different things.  The 3 yr old just danced and had a good time, <br/>
  but Nate was really into investigating!  It was just one part of a <br/>
  day without stress, deadlines and commitments.  I swear, the best <br/>
  part of homeschooling is the whole rush to get out the door thing.  <br/>
  It was awful!  The stress all of us had - my sons, me (and I&#39;m not a <br/>
  morning person to begin with!).  My son would even look at the clock <br/>
  in the car and say &quot;uh-oh it&#39;s 7:59, we&#39;re going to be late&quot;.  Why <br/>
  on earth did I ever put him in a situation where he felt bad before <br/>
  8 am in the morning?!?!<br/>

  &gt; &gt; What makes an unschooler &quot;radical?&quot;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; ??<br/>
  &gt; &gt; Curious,<br/>
  &gt; &gt; Pamela :)<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; Generally, the term &#39;unschooling&#39; refers to an educational <br/>
  &gt; philosophy that is &#39;not school&#39;, doesn&#39;t look like school, sound <br/>
  &gt; like school, feel like school. It is based on trusting that <br/>
  people, <br/>
  &gt; including kids since they&#39;re people too, will learn what they need <br/>
  &gt; when and how they need it in ways that work for them. &quot;Radical&quot; <br/>
  &gt; unschooling is taking that philosophy of trust and applying it to <br/>
  &gt; the rest of life - trusting that our kids will eat what and when <br/>
  and <br/>
  &gt; how works for them, that they&#39;ll sleep when their body says sleep <br/>
  &gt; and wake when they&#39;re finished with sleep, and so on. Treating <br/>
  kids <br/>
  &gt; with the same trust and respect for their individual selves and <br/>
  &gt; choices that you would for a spouse, friend, other adult person.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; So, someone can be unschooling in the academic sense yet have <br/>
  &gt; strictly structured bedtimes, chores, mealtimes, etc. &quot;radical&quot; <br/>
  was <br/>
  &gt; added to differentiate in discussion between folks who extend <br/>
  &gt; unschooling into the whole life of the family.<br/>
