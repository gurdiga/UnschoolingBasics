<div id="ygrps-yiv-1408275525">Hi,<br/>
Just wanted to add encouragement. Even though we don&#39;t have a child  <br/>
with downs, we do have a child with autism, and I imagine you would  <br/>
go through what we went through. Years of intruding therapies and  <br/>
therapists, making everyone increasingly miserable.<br/>
<br/>
Once we started unschooling, we started living again!! Breanna has  <br/>
thrived more than anyone could have imagined, she&#39;s happy and not  <br/>
stressed. She still has bad days, but at least it isn&#39;t one day after  <br/>
another. WIthout any type of us teaching her, she has learned how to  <br/>
cook, she can clean, she&#39;s figuring out all kinds of reading, writing  <br/>
and math. All we do is allow her to live :-)<br/>
<br/>
Melissa<br/>
Mom to Josh (11), Breanna (8), Emily (7), Rachel (6), Sam (4), Dan  <br/>
(2), and Avari Rose<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I abandoned lists of &quot;shoulds&quot; a long time ago, especially when it <br/>
pertained to my son.  Keon falls into that &quot;autistic spectrum.&quot;  I <br/>
used to torment myself because he wasn&#39;t &quot;on track&quot; with the things <br/>
he &quot;should&quot; be doing.  Then one day I decided that Keon was doing <br/>
the things that he &quot;should&quot; be doing because those were the things <br/>
that he needed to be doing at that time.  He&#39;s almost 8 and still <br/>
can&#39;t tie his shoe laces.  So I buy him velcro, slip on and <br/>
sandals.  Sure he &quot;should&quot; be able to tie shoes (according to &quot;the <br/>
lists&quot;), but it is a series of steps that has confounded him.  One <br/>
day when he has the need to tie shoes he&#39;ll be able to.  He was that <br/>
way with reading.  He &quot;should&quot; have been able to read at a certain <br/>
level according to some list.  But he had no need to read.  Then he <br/>
started playing video games and his sisters got tired of reading him <br/>
the instructions and scenarios.  Now he reads at a much higher level <br/>
(I suppose) than most of his almost 8yo counterparts.  I say &quot;I <br/>
suppose&quot; because in reality I don&#39;t know, but I presume that most <br/>
kids his age are daunted by many of the words he uses in his <br/>
vocabulary and his &quot;unfear&quot; of any word.  (He believes that now <br/>
because he knows how to read he knows how to read *every* word and <br/>
for the most part will, although I did have to tell him how to <br/>
correctly pronounce Porsche and that maybe just because he knows how <br/>
to read doesn&#39;t mean he understands French.)  <br/>
