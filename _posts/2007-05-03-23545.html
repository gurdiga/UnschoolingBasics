<div id="ygrps-yiv-1990759966">I have a request that I&#39;d like each of you to consider. I&#39;m compiling<br/>
a book of stories about different unschooling families. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve gotten lots of feedback from our NPR interviews and one common<br/>
thread seems to run through many of the negative comments: &quot;The only<br/>
reason unschooling worked for Laurie is because she&#39;s so intelligent.&quot;<br/>
Well, anyone that understands unschooling knows that&#39;s hogwash. If<br/>
anything, she&#39;s intelligent because she was unschooled. People seem to<br/>
believe that Laurie is the only unschooler out there. And it doesn&#39;t<br/>
matter how many times I say she&#39;s not alone, the average citizen<br/>
doesn&#39;t hear about the others. <br/>
<br/>
I would love to have different voices and different topics in each<br/>
chapter. And it doesn&#39;t matter what you choose to talk about. Everyone<br/>
that writes a chapter will receive a free copy of the book. Here&#39;s<br/>
some ideas, but please feel free to come up with your own.<br/>
<br/>
Why I unschool my children<br/>
The moment I knew I was doing the right thing<br/>
A look inside an unschooling day <br/>
What my child learned today without being taught<br/>
What we call &quot;success&quot; in our unschooling home<br/>
Why being passionate about what we do is so important<br/>
Why we got school out of our lives<br/>
Why we learn best with bare feet<br/>
<br/>
It really doesn&#39;t matter what you write about, as long as it is about<br/>
your unschooling lives. Maybe it&#39;ll give you the itch to write your<br/>
own book, and I&#39;ll be glad to help you get it published. The more info<br/>
about unschooling that&#39;s out there, the better it will be for future<br/>
generations. <br/>
 <br/>

Thank you,<br/>
