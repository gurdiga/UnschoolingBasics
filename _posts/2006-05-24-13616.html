<div id="ygrps-yiv-150664880">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re attending the convention this weekend. I&#39;ll be sans hubby on <br/>
Friday and with my three kids. Can some seasoned attendee tell me what <br/>
it&#39;ll be like? Do the kids come with me to the opening ceremony speech <br/>
at 2? Do they attend some kid event? Is there a cost for these?<br/>
<br/>
Any help would be welcome!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Tonya<br/>
