<div id="ygrps-yiv-1473488219">&quot;If I didn&#39;t come up with something, he&#39;d just sit and<br/>
lie around..unless he played something.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s a schooling problem Sandy, not an unschooling one. I <br/>
really believe that if you think he&#39;d just sit or lie around, <br/>
there&#39;s a lot of healing that needs to happen and you need to shift <br/>
how you see your child.<br/>
<br/>
This list is to help people get to unschooling. Yes, I will tell <br/>
people that a happy home with some school is much better than an <br/>
unhappy one without school, but at the same time, this list is to <br/>
give unschooling advice.<br/>
<br/>
So, I would tell you to STOP schooling him. To trust him fully and <br/>
to not look at his interests as future career material. He&#39;s a kid <br/>
still!! He doesn&#39;t need to think about his future. He needs to live <br/>
in today.<br/>
Passions and interests DO build wonderful futures, but not by trying <br/>
to figure out how to turn an interest into a career until that time <br/>
comes. He&#39;s young. He needs to play video games because he loves <br/>
them, that&#39;s all.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like the video games are only valid if he is thinking <br/>
about a career plan. No, they&#39;re valid because it makes him happy. <br/>
If he never has anything to do with technology or gaming in the <br/>
future, it is valid because he loves it TODAY. He&#39;s learning more <br/>
from that than all the contrived schoolwork, but you&#39;re still <br/>
trusting the schoolwork more.<br/>
<br/>
A joyful, passionate life is tough to find when you are required to <br/>
do things you don&#39;t care for. He still can, but it&#39;s just harder. In <br/>
order to truly support his interests, they need to be enough. They <br/>
aren&#39;t a side thing, or a distraction from more important things, <br/>
they ARE the important things. Get into his world, see what he loves <br/>
about them. Ask him a few questions and try to play with him if <br/>
possible. His future belongs to him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-139464174">Thanks Ren, you are right, it is a schooling problem. <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
Would you all on this list mind helping me for a<br/>
couple of weeks or so if I write down what we did and<br/>
how to best put it into terms that DH may appreciate? <br/>
I would be so thankful.  <br/>
<br/>
