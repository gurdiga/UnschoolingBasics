<div id="ygrps-yiv-2109367171">&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He is just arguing that<br/>
the odds are  better  with a college education. There is no data to <br/>
say  that<br/>
unschooling has just  as good as odds as a formal education and  <br/>
this bothers<br/>
him  greatly.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I know this has been answered quite thoroughly already, but this is <br/>
really sticking in my craw and I NEED to answer.:)<br/>
<br/>
First of all, I&#39;d like to see his &quot;statistics&quot; or studies that back <br/>
this opinion of his. I doubt it exists. If he needs data, rather <br/>
than looking into his sweet child&#39;s eyes to prove what is good and <br/>
right, I can&#39;t help.<br/>
<br/>
My dh and I are not degreed folks. Dh got his AA is business way <br/>
back in the early 80&#39;s. Every bit of his college education is <br/>
obsolete due to the growth in technology. He learned cutting and <br/>
pasting techniques that are useless today. His work has been <br/>
dictated by his interests and talents...he runs his own company, but <br/>
his college education didn&#39;t help prepare him for any of what we do <br/>
today.<br/>
I actually had college credit upon leaving High School. I was so <br/>
burned out on school that I opted for a trade school (to keep my <br/>
parents happy) and never went to college. We live in the South, so <br/>
wages aren&#39;t great here, but I make more than a lot of college <br/>
graduates I know. You know what I do? Paint faces!! Yep, I make more <br/>
as a makeup artist than many computer experts I know. I chose my <br/>
line of work, I LOVE what I do and I&#39;m good at it. I meet some of <br/>
the most interesting people and get to dress funky, wear my hair and <br/>
makeup however I want...very free work environment.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo...I get disgusted when someone thinks college grads have <br/>
better odds for success. I totally disagree. I think free thinkers <br/>
have the greatest odds for success. A free thinker will see college <br/>
for what it is, a TOOL. One of many tools they could choose or not <br/>
choose according to what is best for their own lives. My oldest <br/>
child is leaning towards college because he wants the technical <br/>
training. He&#39;s a D&D/computer obsessed kid that will probably know <br/>
more about computers and programming than most college graduates by <br/>
the time he is 17. Because he&#39;s INTERESTED.<br/>
Interest is the only true motivator. Fear will motivate, but not <br/>
nearly as well.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>While I was visiting my family in MA last week, my mom&#39;s best friend<br/>
came to see me and my kids. She&#39;s a math teacher in a private high<br/>
school and all of her children are geniuses who have had much<br/>
education and hold Ph. D&#39;s. She was recommending the Saxon math books<br/>
to me for Tyler and I was enjoying hearing about her experiences<br/>
working with the books. When she asked me if we would use them at<br/>
home, I answered that we would probably buy a set at some time in the<br/>
future, but that right now we&#39;re just working on finding a rhythm<br/>
together and seeing where life would take us without the constraints<br/>
of hard-core academics.<br/>
<br/>
I thought my mother&#39;s head was going to blow off. She didn&#39;t say<br/>
anything, but her eyes were rolling around like a spooked horse&#39;s. I<br/>
know she was embarrassed to have me speaking this way in front of her<br/>
uber-educated friend. When I brought it up to her later, she hemmed<br/>
and hawed and said that *well, it&#39;s different. I come from a very<br/>
structured background. I really believe education is important and I&#39;m<br/>
concerned that Tyler won&#39;t be able to get into college when it&#39;s time<br/>
because he hasn&#39;t had any of the subjects he needs to get in.*<br/>
<br/>
I asked her what she was doing with the college she had. Her answer is<br/>
the same as mine. Nothing. Except maybe wishing she still had that<br/>
money in the bank!<br/>
<br/>
I mentioned that I thought it possible to prepare for college when the<br/>
time comes, and that if it&#39;s a choice he wants to make that he&#39;ll look<br/>
at what&#39;s necessary (with my help Mom, I won&#39;t be leaving him without<br/>
any guidance!) and will tackle whatever<br/>
reading/testing/writing/studying he has to, because he wants to. But I<br/>
also said that he may not want to go to college and if that&#39;s the<br/>
case, he won&#39;t have been force-fed a ton of information that means<br/>
absolutely nothing to him or his life and made him feel inadequate or<br/>
dumb the way I felt through much of my schooling.<br/>
<br/>
Then she went on to mention a report she&#39;d seen on the news (her<br/>
bible) talking about how most of the tech jobs in this country are<br/>
being out-sourced and that college is becoming unaffordable for the<br/>
average American. The job sector that will grow is the service sector<br/>
and people are needing to have a lot of creative energy and strong<br/>
sense of independence and self-worth to create specialized services<br/>
that will pay well.<br/>
<br/>
My next question to my mother? Do you think they&#39;re teaching that in school?<br/>
<br/>
So this week I will make an effort to remember this conversation<br/>
whenever my fear and doubt bonk me over the head and make me run<br/>
around in my life like my mother&#39;s spooked horse!.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!<br/>
