<div id="ygrps-yiv-1699529606">Today Courtney , my 6 year old got some paper and wrote a good attempt <br/>
at a treble clef and a bunch of quarter and eight notes . She got her <br/>
little brothers care bear piano and announced that she was going to <br/>
play some music for me . Her timing for the eight and quarteer notes <br/>
was surprisingly good.<br/>
<br/>
I had this really bad urge to start teaching her about names of the <br/>
notes and the rest of my limited musical knowledge but I bit my tongue <br/>
because I was afraid Id ruin her fun and I was enjoying watching her <br/>
enjoying playing a song for me. <br/>
<br/>
So Im just wondering at what point if ever do you offer information <br/>
about whatever subject they are currently interested in?</div>

I think after unschooling for a while, it just feels natural and you <br/>
recognize your child&#39;s cues quickly.  When starting out, maybe just<br/>
ask &quot;would you like me to show you_______?&quot; and see what they say.<br/>
<br/>
Or you could offer up some tidbit of info. and let her decide whether<br/>
she wants more or not.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the fact that you bit your tongue and just let her express her<br/>
joy, is a sign that you are recognizing when it&#39;s good to just let a<br/>
moment flow.:)  The goal is enjoyment of the activity, not gathering<br/>
up a certain body of knowledge right?  If she knows that you have<br/>
knowledge in that area, I&#39;ll bet she asks you for more information<br/>
when she wants it.  But yeah, I offer up information on topics at<br/>
times.....it all depends.<br/>

that SHE got that much figured out, if you try to inject the  <br/>
information YOU think she needs, it is like telling her you don&#39;t  <br/>

for help, she was showing you what SHE had learned on her own. Don&#39;t  <br/>
undermine that.<br/>
<br/>
I would sometimes say, &quot;Wow. I&#39;m impressed with what you&#39;ve figured  <br/>
out. That is very cool. If you ever want me to help you figure out  <br/>
anything, just let me know.&quot; But - now I know even THAT wasn&#39;t  <br/>
necessary - it isn&#39;t like my kids wouldn&#39;t already know that I&#39;d help  <br/>
them if they wanted help, right?<br/>
<br/>
I used to ask Roxana, when she was as young as 6 or 7, if she wanted  <br/>
piano lessons. She was happily learning to play, on her own, by  <br/>
figuring things out for herself, over a period of years. Once she  <br/>
looked oddly at me and said, &quot;Okay Mom do you think I don&#39;t KNOW that  <br/>
there are such things as piano lessons? I will let you know if I ever  <br/>
want to take lessons, okay?&quot;  As a college student she signed up for  <br/>
a couple of semesters of piano class - filled in a bunch of little  <br/>
things she hadn&#39;t ever learned on her own, had fun. She&#39;s not a great  <br/>
piano player, but she&#39;s very comfortable with music. She&#39;s a singer  <br/>
and actress - just got a big part in the college musical. All those  <br/>
years of fooling around with the piano make her an unusually good  <br/>
sight reader which means she auditions really well - when they hand  <br/>
her new music to learn in a few minutes, she&#39;s fine with that.<br/>

Well said! I go to a two week medieval event. It is like camping with 10,000<br/>
of your closest friends. One of our bards had his guitar lying on the ground<br/>
and a four year old crept up to it and was gently playing at the strings and<br/>
did so with a neat little tune.<br/>
<br/>
A few minutes later when his mother discovered him playing tried to teach<br/>
him at which he got bored and walked away. The bard told me that was the day<br/>
he learn to never interfere with someone else&#39;s learning process.<br/>
<br/>
May I ask what she was exposed to that led her to the interest of writing<br/>
music?<br/>

   <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Ya know Im not completely sure. She is in school ( kindergarten her request....though prob from a very persuasive neighbor) and they do have &quot;music class&quot; once a week. I dont know how much if any written music they actually see there ...I know they sing songs and sometimes play rythm instruments. <br/>
  Since they could pick something up my kiddos have had access to various instruments..........keyboard, kid size guitar, lap harp, xylophone, toy maracas, toy drum , plastic bowls, spoons etc. <br/>
  She has this v-smile game she hasnt touched in months but one part she used to play a lot would play a song and light up the notes and their letter names as it played the song. <br/>
   <br/>
  I asked her and she said well I just saw some music notes hanging up at music class so I thought Id write a pretty song myself. Did your music teacher show you the music notes and teach you about them ?  .....&quot;No they are just hanging up in the classroom&quot;<br/>
   <br/>
  Heh forgive me for writing a book here but this makes me think of courtney&#39;s last report card. Right after one of my weekly lunches with Courtney her teacher sort of apologizes and says that she cant give Court a &quot;perfect&quot; report card because she refused to learn her address ( she informed her teacher that she didnt care about it ) <br/>
  I found that humorous and told dh about it saying wonder why she told Mrs J that?<br/>
  He ( ironicly the one who isnt sure about completely unschooling) said well she just dosent have a use for it yet. Sure enough about 2 weeks later the church bus was going to take her home . She asked me to write her address down for her so I did and told her what her address is . She has known her address ever since.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When I was growing up I had an interest in guitar playing.  I had a<br/>
beginner&#39;s guitar to plunk around on.  My folks told me that if I would<br/>
take lessons they would get me a &quot;real&quot; guitar.  They *never* [that I<br/>
can recall] ever criticized my music in any way but I didn&#39;t want to<br/>
take lessons, all I wanted to do was &quot;plunk around&quot; on the thing.  It<br/>
was an escape for me...something that I could do for self enjoyment in<br/>
my own private space.<br/>
<br/>
My Mother told me YEARS later that she and my dad so enjoyed listening<br/>
to me play the guitar [while I was in my bedroom with the door closed]<br/>
but they didn&#39;t dare say anything to me about it.  Unbeknownced to me<br/>
then, they would sit in the living room in complete silence just<br/>
listening to me play.  If someone did say something to me about my music<br/>
I would inadvertently put the guitar away and not touch it for weeks!  I<br/>
told my Mother that I didn&#39;t think my actions [reactions?] were<br/>
intentional, merely something unconscious that I did.  Really I don&#39;t<br/>
remember doing such things.  LOL   I think I may have felt infringed<br/>
upon.  My music was for ME.  If anyone [my parents] said anything about<br/>
my music I felt that they had infringed into &quot;my space&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
After having my own child I can understand the enjoyment my folks had<br/>
while listening to *my* music.  My son can not hold a tune to save his<br/>
life but when he sings it&#39;s the best thing I have ever heard!!  I know<br/>
that if my son is singing he is *happy* and I wouldn&#39;t trade any of<br/>
those sour notes for anything in the world!  Instead of cringing to the<br/>
sour notes I relish the moments.  :-)   I have not tried to &quot;help&quot; him<br/>
in any way.  His singing is pure expression of what he feels inside,<br/>
something I wouldn&#39;t jeopardize.<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I am trying to say, just enjoy your daughter&#39;s exploration<br/>
of music, afterall she is including *you* into it!  :-)  [something I<br/>
didn&#39;t do with my parents]<br/>

  First congats to her! <br/>
   <br/>
  Second .....I wont lie I am somewhat worried about Courtney learning to read. She turns 7 in July and seems to have no intrest at all. But I often wonder if kids who learn to read later because they were not pushed ( I know there are a few out there who just pick it up at 3-4 yrs) have an advantage in the long run?<br/>
  My mom started teaching me to read at 3 and by 4 I was reading pretty well then went on to k , etc where of course reading was pushed a lot! Now I feel like Im dependant on the written word. Courtney can repeat back a long series of keys played on the keyboard, repeat back a story no problem and often, spit out info about stuff she asked Daddy about months ago. I cant even remember someone name unless I write it down! <br/>
  Maybe its simply our different styles of thinking and learning but I do still wonder if reading later is going to end up being an advantage to her. <br/>
   <br/>
  Just my random thought for the day :),<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One of mine learned to read, all on her own, at 3 years old.  <br/>
Fluently. With expression!<br/>
<br/>
One didn&#39;t learn to read at all until she was pushing 8 years old.<br/>
<br/>
At 15 and 18, they read equally well and enjoy a lot of the same  <br/>
books. Roxana (the earlier reader) is a bit more extensively hooked  <br/>
into the world of literature - Rosie is more physical - plays soccer,  <br/>
does karate, has been playing Dance Dance Revolution for the past  <br/>
half hour. But, on the other hand, recently she made a list of what  <br/>
she considers &quot;don&#39;t miss&quot; books - for her friends. And she thinks  <br/>
she might want to be a librarian - she has worked  for an hour a week  <br/>
in the public library for over a year.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t say that those who read earlier have an advantage - but  <br/>
they might turn out to be kids who are always really really into  <br/>
reading. I mean kids who ON THEIR OWN read early, of course, not  <br/>
those forced to learn before they&#39;d have naturally wanted to. This is  <br/>
no different than other things kids show an early interest in - my  <br/>
nephew showed an early interest in ball games - any kind of ball  <br/>
games - he just wanted to kick and throw balls for hours - since  <br/>
before he could walk. So - he&#39;s 12 and still really loves to play ball.<br/>
<br/>
Kids who read later might have some advantages, too, though. I have  <br/>
observed that they often develop their other learning modes more than  <br/>
other kids who read earlier, especially those who were schooled/ <br/>
taught/coerced into learning to read early. I know a kid who didn&#39;t  <br/>
read until 12/13 or so - but his ability to listen to verbal  <br/>
information, sort it out, keep it in his mind, etc., is truly  <br/>
remarkable.<br/>
<br/>
NOT that college success is the way to measure the value of  <br/>
everything - but it might be useful to think about college and what  <br/>
is really useful there.  I mean, what do most college classes  <br/>
involve? Listening to lectures. Good setup for the kid who has great  <br/>
listening skills!<br/>

This made me think of all the things that my parents did that actually led  <br/>
me to unschooling, in a way, despite never, ever having homeschooling, much <br/>
less  unschooling, occur to them.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s cool that they got that you needed NOT to have it acknowledged, but  <br/>
still took such joy from it. Even if you didn&#39;t know at the time, I bet it felt  <br/>
wonderful and close to have your mom share that with you.<br/>
 <br/>
My parents treated me and my sister very differently, it seemed, than most  <br/>
of our friends treated them. My parent led interesting lives, and we were <br/>
always  welcome along. They had fascinating friends who would come to the house, <br/>
and we  were never excluded from conversations or sent off &quot;to play.&quot; I remember <br/>
one  evening (I was about 10 or 11) they had a couple over, and about 11 PM <br/>
they all  decided it would be fun to drive from our home in upstate NY to <br/>
Montreal, about  three and a half hours, for breakfast.  We all plopped into the <br/>
station  wagon and headed up. It was an adventure.<br/>
