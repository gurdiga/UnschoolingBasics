<div id="ygrps-yiv-550267047">Hello to all the new members! I hope you enjoy this place as much as I <br/>
do. :-)<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if anybody suggested this yet but whenever you have a few <br/>
extra minutes, go back and read the messages starting from #1. There <br/>
is so much good information there that it would make a great book! <br/>
<br/>
Anyway...welcome!<br/>
