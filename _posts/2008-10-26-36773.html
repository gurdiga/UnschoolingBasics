<div id="ygrps-yiv-673664289">I&#39;m new to unschooling and so far have really enjoyed it but the one <br/>
issue I&#39;m hung up on is letting my 6 yo ds and 2 yo dd choose their <br/>
foods.  I&#39;ve started lifting my eating controls on them this past <br/>
week and it has been so hard for me to watch them make their <br/>
choices!  I realize it will take awhile for them to balance out and <br/>
adjust to knowing that they can eat whatever they want, whenever they <br/>
want but frankly, watching my son choose ice cream (huge amounts) and <br/>
chips everyday (with the few excpetions of eating some healthier <br/>
things in between) just makes me cringe!!  He is eating so much junk <br/>
that I&#39;m worried for his health!  He is also staying up later because <br/>
I&#39;ve loosened on that end as well and now, not only is he eating so <br/>
much sugar, he has huge dark circles under his eyes!  Looking at him <br/>
makes me feel like I am completely neglecting him and it makes me <br/>
feel like crying b/c I really like the philosophy of unschooling all <br/>
around (not just in &quot;teaching&quot;) but looking at him I am beginning to <br/>
have my doubts! I need to know if this is normal when controls are <br/>
first loosened and should I just wait it out.  Eating healthy has <br/>
always been a priority in my life for myself and my family and <br/>
watching this is truly killing me!  He just asked for more ice cream <br/>
after eating a HUGE bowl of it and is finishing the rest of the <br/>
carton...my mom instincts are raging to tell him NO...I&#39;m really <br/>
hopeful someone can help me...should I go back to SOME controls at <br/>
this point?<br/>
thanks so much for your help!<br/>

 He is eating so much junk <br/>
<br/>
that I&#39;m worried for his health!  He is also staying up later because <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve loosened on that end as well and now, not only is he eating so <br/>
much sugar, he has huge dark circles under his eyes!  Looking at him <br/>
makes me feel like I am completely neglecting him and it makes me <br/>
feel like crying b/c I really like the philosophy of unschooling all <br/>
around (not just in &quot;teaching&quot;) but looking at him I am beginning to <br/>
have my doubts! <br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How long has this been going on? Days? Weeks? Months?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Are you offering meats and cheeses and fruits and vegies? Are they all as available as the ice cream and chips? Ultra-convenient and beautifully presented?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What are you doing to help him sleep? Do you dim the lights? Put on gentle, soothing music? Rub his feet and head?Hold and rock him to sleep?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s *really* NOT about just dropping the metaphoric &quot;rule floor&quot; out from under them. It&#39;s about s-l-o-w-l-y lifting the arbitrary restrictions you&#39;ve had while keeping a safety net under them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t MAKE him figure all this out on his own. *Let* him, with your help.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Make sure you have *lots* of healthful options all day. Others have mentioned &quot;monkey platters.&quot; That gives him a choice. Remember that most children LOVE to &quot;dip&quot;---hummus, ranch dressing, salsa, caramel sauce, melted chocolate, cheese sauce, salad dressing, cream cheese spread. Toothpicks are a mom&#39;s best friend: cut up *everything* and stick a toothpick in it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
With sleep, are you just leaving things alone until the child collapses? Make the space sleep-inducing, with soft music, dim lights, and a lavender massage. *Help* him sleep.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I need to know if this is normal when controls are <br/>
first loosened and should I just wait it out.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Of course it is! Completely normal and expected! And the stricter the controls, the more <br/>
<br/>
&quot;ravenous&quot; they&#39;ll be! Can you imagine what it would be like to be controlled for 18 years <br/>
<br/>
and THEN have the controls loosened/disappear? Yeah---typical college behavior.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Eating healthy has <br/>
always been a priority in my life for myself and my family and <br/>
watching this is truly killing me!  <br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-==-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
No, it&#39;s not. You&#39;re uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
He just asked for more ice cream <br/>
after eating a HUGE bowl of it and is finishing the rest of the <br/>
carton...my mom instincts are raging to tell him NO...I&#39;m really <br/>
hopeful someone can help me...should I go back to SOME controls at <br/>
this point?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you start controlling again, the *next* time will be harder because the child will have lost trust in you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Patience.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2008852620">We are new to unschooling, too, a little over 2 months or so now.  I<br/>
am enjoying the change in atmosphere and struggling with ideologies of<br/>
my own as well.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, just wanted to share a little about what has been happening<br/>
here regarding sleep, food, tv....<br/>
<br/>
At first, both ds (5 and 1/2) and dd (1 and 1/2) went to town, staying<br/>
up til all hours, eating a lot of what I consider junk.  HOwever, I<br/>
have noticed lately that both dd and ds are asking/helping themselves<br/>
to healthier food options.  My dh took ds to the local country store<br/>
yesterday a.m. b/c ds wanted a donut or danish.  He returned with an<br/>
egg sandwich!  My dh was blown away!  (So glad to for dh to see the<br/>
positives for himself ;)  Ds will say, I want something good like a<br/>
banana and help himself or ask for a healthy snack. Dd will help<br/>
herself to fruit and veggie platters (great info on Sandra&#39;s site re:<br/>
monkey platters)  Now that candy, etc. is not on restriction, they are<br/>
happy to choose what they want when their bodies want/need it!  :)<br/>
<br/>
Sleep.  Ds has always been a late to bed kind of persons, dh and I are<br/>
night owls by choice.  Anyhow, now ds pretty much stays up with us<br/>
until the last goes to bed, however, if he is tired, he will ask one<br/>
of us to read stories in bed or snuggle on the couch in front of the<br/>
fire.  We do lower the lights, music, etc when it starts to get late,<br/>
or we see signs of tiredness.  The interesting thing is that dd, has<br/>
been saying she&#39;s tired and wants to go to bed or go for a ride to<br/>
look for the moon when she is ready! <br/>
<br/>
TV was totally my issue.  Dh, dd, and ds like to watch and I am much<br/>
more inclined to read.  In the past I was uncomfortable with the tv<br/>
watching, dh had no problem and often pointed out that the children<br/>
would choose to turn it off and walk away.  I wasn&#39;t willing to see<br/>
that.  Now that I have relaxed about it and don&#39;t say anything<br/>
anymore, I, too, see that they all watch and then make other choices<br/>
of what to do with their time!  <br/>
<br/>
I am finding that if I allow SPACE for things to occur, it falls into<br/>
place.  I am not sure if that makes sense, so ask for clarification if<br/>
you want.   <br/>
<br/>
We are certainly enjoying the transition, although it is chaotic at<br/>
times...that&#39;s life!  I am still struggling with my own needs as I<br/>
grew up being told not to &quot;upset mom&quot; or don&#39;t upset &quot;dad&quot;.  It&#39;s<br/>
freeing to realize that my needs are important and that I am a better<br/>
mom when I take advantage of the opportunities throughout the day to<br/>
have a minute or two to myself!<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, thanks for reading and for all of your wonderful posts and<br/>
challenges!  Have a great day!<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Amy Lewis<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1832519984">Thanks so much for sharing your experiences!  I loved reading about <br/>
it!  I&#39;m really starting to see some shifts too...we went to my mom&#39;s <br/>
yesterday and she had some candy out.  My ds had a COUPLE of pieces <br/>
and then chose to eat a BANANA!!  I was thrilled but of course played <br/>
it off as a nonchalant (sp?) event :) Normally he would have had so <br/>
much!  I went food shopping today and got lots of great monkeyplatter <br/>
items...can&#39;t wait to put these platters together.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for sharing your experiences! I loved reading about <br/>
it! I&#39;m really starting to see some shifts too...we went to my mom&#39;s <br/>
yesterday and she had some candy out. My ds had a COUPLE of pieces <br/>
and then chose to eat a BANANA!! I was thrilled but of course played <br/>
it off as a nonchalant (sp?) event :) Normally he would have had so <br/>
much! I went food shopping today and got lots of great monkeyplatter <br/>
items...can&#39; t wait to put these platters together.<br/>

&gt; positives for himself ;) Ds will say, I want something good like a<br/>
