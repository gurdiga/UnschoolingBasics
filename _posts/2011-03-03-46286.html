&gt; this is absolutely true! and I also wanted to say that it took much longer<br/>
&gt; than one month per year of school for one of my children (ironically, the<br/>
&gt; younger one!) and a bit shorter for the older one � every child and every<br/>
&gt; child�s relationship with learning and experience/damage from school is<br/>
&gt; different.<br/>

&quot;ahh, deschooling is over with, we must be really unschooling now.&quot;<br/>
 Sometime after I stopped thinking about the deschooling process, we we<br/>
moved through it.  I was writing a letter to someone about 18 months after<br/>
we burned the curriculum and I realized we were really unschooling now, and<br/>
at that point I could look back and see when the change happened.  We still<br/>
have days where we&#39;re not sure how to move through something behavior<br/>
related, but the learning is happening.  It&#39;s not separated in to school<br/>
subjects, or school learning and recreational learning it just *is*!<br/>
<br/>
Has it happened like this to anyone else?  Where you don&#39;t see the shift,<br/>
but you see that the shift happened?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1012882621">I think that&#39;s how it happens with a lot of things. Dang, I didn&#39;t see those five pounds piling on but now these jeans are tight. :)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not just the kids who are deschooling, after all. It&#39;s the parents, too. Most of us had all those years of school and then the expectation that we would school our kids. Then we sent them to school and tried to make that a positive experience, all rah-rah about the whole thing. <br/>
<br/>
And then we have to let ourselves acknowledge that that way didn&#39;t work and maybe, just maybe, we were wrong about something. That maybe we have to think about something we thought we knew the answer to in a completely different way. With resistance and mixed messages all around us.<br/>
<br/>
That takes time, longer than we think (like taking those five pounds off) and then we finally have a relaxed day when we are just enjoying life and our kids. Then you have a few of those in a row. Enough to realize what&#39;s happening. Oh, look. The jeans fit again! :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1974629817">Ray was more or less done deschooling schoolish stuff in less than a year - and I did have a kind aha! moment, when he said something like &quot;you can&#39;t do Anything without learning Something&quot;. That being said other things - housework and relationships in particular - took much longer, more like two years, and there are issues where I think he&#39;ll be sort of perpetually deschooling, since he&#39;s still very involved with his bio mom, and she&#39;s rather controlling. <br/>
