<div id="ygrps-yiv-800687120">I am really fascinated by this comment by one of the posters on<br/>
another thread.  In fact I was going to ask a related question about<br/>
it when I came on today.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I think most mainstream parents would have less problems with<br/>
unschooling (even radical unschooling or even &quot;unparenting&quot;) presented<br/>
as &quot;we supervise and interact with our younger kids a lot, and we try<br/>
to refuse as little as possible, and when we do set limits, we try to<br/>
do that as humanely as possible, explaining as much a possible, and<br/>
and with as much compromise as we (the parents) feel is reasonable in<br/>
order to support as much of the original intent of the child as<br/>
possible, considering the needs and limitations of everyone in the family&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So what is the difference (if any) between &quot;unschooling&quot; and what the<br/>
poster says above?  There was an example I think in one of the threads<br/>
about a little girl who wanted to go to the beach *now* when the beach<br/>
is 2 days away.  In my own home my son wanted to go out yesterday to a<br/>
museum across town (on foot) after we had done errands and when he and<br/>
I would be too tired and museum would only be open for about 15<br/>
minutes when we got there.<br/>
<br/>
In my mind I am seeing adults who know that the answer to the *stated*<br/>
request is &quot;no&quot;.  Yes there can be examination and reflection on what<br/>
are the child&#39;s needs/desires/feelings/unstated requests and<br/>
suggestions of alternatives etc which may or may not be agreeable to<br/>
the child. And as mentioned by the poster I have quoted at the top,<br/>
this can all be done honorably, respectfully etc until child&#39;s needs<br/>
(as best as we can discern them) are met to the best of our ability -<br/>
with the child&#39;s wishes/development etc at the heart of discussion.  <br/>
<br/>
But isn&#39;t this still an unstated &quot;no&quot; to the original request? Thank<br/>
you for helping me to understand this point.<br/>

But isn&#39;t this still an unstated &quot;no&quot; to the original request?~~<br/>
<br/>
No isn&#39;t some tabboo. I&#39;ve never read from anyone here saying &quot;you<br/>
should never, ever say no to your child&quot; only advocating ways to meet<br/>
their needs and be able to say yes more.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No&quot; can be mindful! Last night, in Asheville we were picking up<br/>
Trevor from a weekend away (he&#39;s 17). We had planned to walk many<br/>
blocks up to Pritchard park but Trevor was feeling cruddy with a sore<br/>
throat and really wanted to go home right away. Leaving him in the van<br/>
for a while wasn&#39;t an option he relished. I was having some physical<br/>
issues as well.<br/>
<br/>
So....Jalen had his heart set on going to the park. We explained all<br/>
the issues we were dealing with, but he really doesn&#39;t care for the<br/>
most part. He tends to get &quot;stuck&quot; on certain ideas and has a very<br/>
difficult time transitioning. <br/>
<br/>
Had this been an area where we could drive close to  the park, I would<br/>
have done that. It&#39;s a many, many block walk with no close parking (we<br/>
were lucky to find a spot within three blocks of the original<br/>
destination) and it wasn&#39;t going to work for that moment.<br/>
<br/>
So yeah, a &quot;no&quot; happened. It does happen. Real life and being sick or<br/>
tired or not having money or whatever...it happens. But for us, it&#39;s a<br/>
&quot;no-for-right-this-second&quot; and we&#39;ll find ways to make it work later. <br/>
<br/>
It sucked for Jalen and I wish I could have changed it. Unfortunately<br/>
MY physical issue needed new clothes and NOT walking around.:)<br/>
<br/>
I told him how much I wanted to go to the park with him and I was<br/>
really sorry it just wasn&#39;t going to work out tonight. I explained<br/>
that when we come through again we&#39;ll make sure and go to the park<br/>
first. He&#39;s just not developmentally able to handle changes to plans<br/>
very well.....it&#39;s not easy to tell him &quot;no&quot; but it does happen<br/>
occasionally.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s life. The point is we try and find ways to adapt so everyone<br/>
can get what they need. It doesn&#39;t always work ideally. But the most<br/>
important thing is nobody told him his need for the park was<br/>
unreasonable. Everyone was sympathetic. He knows we care about his<br/>
desires.<br/>

&quot;world view&quot;. If I start from a place that says my job<br/>
is to meet my kid&#39;s needs, then I try harder to meet<br/>
their needs. On the other hand, if my starting place<br/>
is that we can&#39;t always get what we want and my kids<br/>
have to learn to deal with that then I won&#39;t try as<br/>
hard to meet my kid&#39;s needs. If you take an example of<br/>
me saying no, it would be hard to tell which place I&#39;m<br/>
coming from. But I think kids do sense the difference.<br/>
They sense whether you&#39;re on their team or an<br/>
authority figure to limit them.<br/>
<br/>
My brother-in-law and his wife are very authoritarian.<br/>
They used to live in CA and a few days ago they moved<br/>
to NJ. Their daughter (14) wanted to spend the rest of<br/>
the summer in CA and she was not allowed to. There was<br/>
no exploration of possibilities of friends she could<br/>
stay with. Heck, her parents did not even acknowledge<br/>
the idea that it would be boring for her to spend the<br/>
summer where she knows no-one. They were not one bit<br/>
sympathetic. It was just a plain, blunt no that was<br/>
repeated again and again. All of this conversation (if<br/>
it can be called that) happenned at our house and it<br/>
was horrid.<br/>
<br/>
I really can&#39;t say whether in the same situation I<br/>
would&#39;ve let my daughter stay across the country or<br/>
not. Maybe my answer also would&#39;ve been no. But I<br/>
would&#39;ve tried a lot harder to find a place for her to<br/>
stay. And I believe that desire to try and meet her<br/>
needs makes a difference in my relationship with my<br/>
daughter.<br/>

to help our kids find solutions that they can feel good about, even <br/>
when those solutions doen&#39;t look anything like the original request. <br/>
That includes helping our kids feel loved and supported in the face <br/>
of disappointment. That&#39;s something that&#39;s easy to lose sight of if <br/>
a parent is focused on limits and lessons, on the idea that &quot;kids <br/>
need to learn they can&#39;t always get what they want&quot;. Kids do learn <br/>
that. As unschoolers, we can help them learn about love and trust <br/>
and mutual support and kindness and grace and self-esteem at the <br/>
same time.<br/>

on the subject of moving away from the idea that he needed to either <br/>

-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
I think one thing that&#39;s not been mentioned is that, because we spend <br/>
SOOO much time helping our children and saying &quot;yes&quot; whenever we can, <br/>
when we DO find &quot;no&quot; to be the only answer, our children know it&#39;s not <br/>
arbitrary and that we&#39;ve thought about it. They understand that we <br/>
*would* have said &quot;yes&quot; if at all possible. Mine take &quot;no&quot; as a <br/>
reasonable answer. &quot;No&quot; happens---but it&#39;s not arbitrary.<br/>
<br/>
Mine also are encouraged to think of another option which we WILL <br/>
consider. Sometimes the answer IS &quot;no&quot;---but not until after we have <br/>
exhausted all possiblilities.<br/>
<br/>
But because this is &quot;natural&quot; for them, they accept &quot;no&quot; as real and as <br/>
the last resort.<br/>
<br/>
BIG difference to a child who hears &quot;no&quot; as the answer to any request.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It was a pretty clearly stated &quot;no&quot; actually :) or more <br/>
accurately &quot;I&#39;m really sorry but that&#39;s not possible&quot;. The <br/>
difference between radical unschooling and &quot;gentle discipline&quot; <br/>
though, is a shift in focus away from the ideas of limits and saying <br/>
no and *toward* the ideas of facilitation and partnership. Its a <br/>
conceptual shift that effects the way we interact with our kids on a <br/>
daily basis and over the long term. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;... with as much compromise as we (the parents) feel is reasonable <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have certainly made statements like this to conventional parents, <br/>
but there&#39;s a significant degree of obfuscation there. Part of the <br/>
unschooling journey involves stretching the idea of &quot;reasonable&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
My school-at-home girlfriend believes its &quot;reasonable&quot; that her 7yo <br/>
should obey her promptly since she can never know if what her <br/>
parents say is urgent. That&#39;s not &quot;reasonable&quot; from an unschooling <br/>
pov. So a statement like the above doesn&#39;t further anyone&#39;s <br/>
understanding of radical unschooling. Its a placating statement, <br/>
useful in some social situations, but not a terribly informative <br/>
one. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; In my mind I am seeing adults who know that the answer to the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>*stated*<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; request is &quot;no&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sometimes the answer *is* no - that 2day drive to the beach, for <br/>
instance - but in a sense its not *my* answer, its a statement of <br/>
geography. TN is not located near an ocean. <br/>
<br/>
The trouble comes when a parent &quot;knows&quot; the answer is no without <br/>
really considering all the possibilities. Automatic or knee-jerk <br/>
nos. We&#39;re socialized to produce those nos first. That kind of <br/>
behavior is modled for us, parents, every time we interact with <br/>
almost any other family.  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a big part of my reluctance to say &quot;of course its okay to say <br/>
no sometimes&quot;. It takes a lot of practice to say &quot;yes&quot; first. It <br/>
takes stopping and thinking Every Time, re-examining each and every <br/>
decision, every &quot;no&quot; and &quot;not now&quot;. Until you do that (generic you, <br/>
not personal) you don&#39;t realize how few of those limits you&#39;ve <br/>
really thought about and how many you&#39;ve swallowed hook, line and <br/>
sinker, from your own parents and the world around you. When you <br/>
start to realize that, its humbling. <br/>
<br/>
It takes even more time and practice to actively involve childen in <br/>
decision making - especially for those of us (true confession, here) <br/>
who like to think we&#39;re good at solving problems and coming up with <br/>
solutions. It takes a good dose of personal discipline and humility <br/>
to trust that our kids can come up with ideas every bit as good as <br/>
our own - even younger kids. Really. It takes time and patience and <br/>
the willingness to say &quot;well, I f#ed that up...&quot; - not just in our <br/>
heads but to our kids - and try again. And again. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;we supervise and interact with our younger kids a lot, and we try<br/>
&gt; to refuse as little as possible, and when we do set limits, we try <br/>
 </span></blockquote>to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; do that as humanely as possible, explaining as much a possible, and<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; order to support as much of the original intent of the child as<br/>
&gt; possible, considering the needs and limitations of everyone in the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>family&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The biggest problem with that statement is its not really about <br/>
people in relationships, its about behavior. I&#39;d far rather say &quot;I <br/>
enjoy my kids&#39; company and seek to support their passions every <br/>
day!&quot; Getting There - to joyful and passionate living with children -<br/>
 that&#39;s the crux of unschooling. That&#39;s what makes it Radical.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-610204418">grrr - I just deleted a long post, will try again<br/>
<br/>
Some of it I get and some of it I really can&#39;t see the difference<br/>
between traditional gentle parenting and unschooling.  For example<br/>
(pheww took me ages to find it again) <br/>
<br/>
&quot;For some people, living in a world of implicit limits may even seem<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; worse than living in a world of explicit limits -- since you never<br/>
 </span></blockquote>know as a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; kid when you will get a &quot;discussion&quot; or &quot;frown&quot; (punishments from<br/>
 </span></blockquote>some kids&#39;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; point of view?) for breaking an implicit rule or passing an<br/>
 </span></blockquote>invisible fence<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; you never knew was there.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a big part of what I mean by &quot;confusion&quot;. This isn&#39;t<br/>
unschooling. Its not what radical unschoolers are trying to express.<br/>
What this describes is parents manipulating children and that&#39;s a<br/>
different matter.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My question is, how is what unschoolers do in this situation not<br/>
manipulating if traditional but gentle parenting is manipulating?  In<br/>
both cases something will come up, the requested thing won&#39;t be<br/>
allowed, a discussion about options (forget the frowning bit) will<br/>
follow, and hopefully an agreeable solution will be reached.  So<br/>
what&#39;s the difference?  You&#39;ll want an example  so let&#39;s say, for<br/>
example, you&#39;ve just varnished the deck and it&#39;s still wet, and your<br/>
child wants to chalk on it right now.  For both families that just<br/>
isn&#39;t going to be possible, both will discuss options and in both<br/>
cases there might be an happier outcome (eg child happily chalks on<br/>
the outside wall) or a less happy outcome (child has a screaming fit<br/>
because they really want to do it right now and can&#39;t accept any<br/>
discussion of alternatives).  So where&#39;s the difference? (except<br/>
perhaps a difference in how the parents might deal with the screaming<br/>
fit child)<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the difference is in the intentions of the parent?  Isn&#39;t that<br/>
very obscure from the child&#39;s point of view? Why does it matter if the<br/>
conversations and outcomes are the same but the parent has a slightly<br/>
different slant on it?<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe it&#39;s to do with the building of a relationship of trust from<br/>
the point of view of the child?  Ie, the traditionally gently parented<br/>
child might be aware and begrudge in the discussion that the parents<br/>
are trying to work round to the child doing something other than what<br/>
they want to do.  But with the unschooled child they trust that the<br/>
parent is trying to work something out sincerely with the child&#39;s<br/>
interests at heart?  <br/>
<br/>
See, now I&#39;m lost again because of course the traditional parents will<br/>
also have the child&#39;s interests at the heart of their discussions, so<br/>
why would the child see it any differently?  And also, surely the<br/>
unschooled child, just like the traditionally parented child, will<br/>
sometimes get mad at the parents because for whatever reason it just<br/>
isn&#39;t possible for them to do the thing they want when they want to do<br/>
it eg chalking on the wet deck?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-956122889">~~&quot;No&quot; happens---but it&#39;s not arbitrary.~~<br/>
<br/>
Exactly.<br/>
I have certain preferences about Jalen not eating foods in my room or<br/>
some parts of the house. Its definitely a limit, but its far from<br/>
arbitrary.:) He really does not have the ability to keep sticky syrup<br/>
off of my stuff, or my floor or EVERYWHERE. We do what we can to get<br/>
him mats or little tables...doesn&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
So, he knows that I really don&#39;t like sticky, gooey food on my<br/>
personal stuff and he doesn&#39;t take it to my room anymore. Its a form<br/>
of &quot;no&quot; based on personal boundaries and actual experience. Nothing<br/>
arbitrary about it.<br/>
<br/>
He can take it into his room, or eat it at the table first. But if<br/>
it&#39;s my room I prefer he doesn&#39;t bring certain foods down there. Chips<br/>
and crackers and apples and such are fine. I really don&#39;t like<br/>
stepping in a puddle of syrup though.<br/>
<br/>
I think the reason we don&#39;t give so many examples of &quot;no&quot; here, is<br/>
that is COMMON. Everybody &quot;knows&quot; children need to hear no right?<br/>
Wrong. Real life examples work so much better because there are a ton<br/>
of creative folks here that can brainstorm alternative soluations to<br/>
&quot;no&quot;. Once you start thinking that way, the &quot;no&#39;s&quot; are few and far<br/>
between. When they happen, it&#39;s been through a problem solving process<br/>
that puts everyone&#39;s needs at the forefront.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-341842126">So would you say then that something that will cause what Mum<br/>
considers to be too much extra work for her (for whatever reason,<br/>
she&#39;s sick, tired, busy, or just doesn&#39;t want to do it) a reasonable<br/>
reason to say &quot;no&quot;?  <br/>
<br/>
A small real life example - son covered in mud from head to toe trails<br/>
through the house leaving a trail of mud and soil and goes to the<br/>
toilet leaving the bathroom and toilet also wet/muddy/soily.  Then<br/>
goes back out.  Mum clears it up a little knowing very well that the<br/>
big clean up will have to follow later, then son returns later to be<br/>
cleaned up, mud caked clothes, soil dropping everywhere (if you&#39;ve<br/>
never had this experience please realise that the mud and soil can&#39;t<br/>
be contained even if you remove all clothing outside the house!!!)<br/>
taken for a shower, more mud on the bath, tiles, floor, toilet,<br/>
washbasin, door frames - you name it - there&#39;s going to be mud there.<br/>
<br/>
Couple hours later wants to go in the sand pit - same scenario except<br/>
sand is not as messy as mud.  Son comes in, clean up procedure<br/>
undertaken again - new set of clean clothes (no, the previously worn<br/>
muddy clothes can&#39;t be worn outside in the mud again - you have to see<br/>
it to believe it - a walking mud man).<br/>
<br/>
Few hours later son wants to return to the mud pit.  This time it&#39;s a<br/>
no.  Mum (me of course) feels she&#39;s been extremely patient already by<br/>
not yelling about the first round of mud everywhere and by allowing<br/>
the sand pit bonanza.<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe that happened one day and mud boy wants to go in the mud<br/>
again the next morning.  Understandably (I think) Mum wants to say<br/>
&quot;absolutely no way!!!&quot; but instead tries to persuade/interest and if<br/>
necessary boss mud boy into not going in the mud today. So he doesn&#39;t<br/>
go but he&#39;s not left with happy feelings about it.<br/>
<br/>
What do you say?<br/>

So would you say then that something that will cause what Mum<br/>
considers to be too much extra work for her (for whatever reason,<br/>
she&#39;s sick, tired, busy, or just doesn&#39;t want to do it) a reasonable<br/>
reason to say &quot;no&quot;? <br/>
<br/>
A small real life example - son covered in mud from head to toe trails<br/>
through the house leaving a trail of mud and soil and goes to the<br/>
toilet leaving the bathroom and toilet also wet/muddy/soily. Then<br/>
goes back out. Mum clears it up a little knowing very well that the<br/>
big clean up will have to follow later, then son returns later to be<br/>
cleaned up, mud caked clothes, soil dropping everywhere (if you&#39;ve<br/>
never had this experience please realise that the mud and soil can&#39;t<br/>
be contained even if you remove all clothing outside the house!!!)<br/>
taken for a shower, more mud on the bath, tiles, floor, toilet,<br/>
washbasin, door frames - you name it - there&#39;s going to be mud there.<br/>
<br/>
Couple hours later wants to go in the sand pit - same scenario except<br/>
sand is not as messy as mud. Son comes in, clean up procedure<br/>
undertaken again - new set of clean clothes (no, the previously worn<br/>
muddy clothes can&#39;t be worn outside in the mud again - you have to see<br/>
it to believe it - a walking mud man).<br/>
<br/>
Few hours later son wants to return to the mud pit. This time it&#39;s a<br/>
no. Mum (me of course) feels she&#39;s been extremely patient already by<br/>
not yelling about the first round of mud everywhere and by allowing<br/>
the sand pit bonanza.<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe that happened one day and mud boy wants to go in the mud<br/>
again the next morning. Understandably (I think) Mum wants to say<br/>
&quot;absolutely no way!!!&quot; but instead tries to persuade/interest and if<br/>
necessary boss mud boy into not going in the mud today. So he doesn&#39;t<br/>
go but he&#39;s not left with happy feelings about it.<br/>
<br/>
What do you say?<br/>

We just leave the house hooked up and rinse off outside. There used to be days where I <br/>
was more worried about mud, but really, at this point I trust that the cleaning will happen <br/>
some day, and the relationship with the kids is more important. You can&#39;t see in the <br/>

I also think that if you spend most of the time saying Yes, not only do you get in the habit <br/>
of saying Yes (and finding alternatives), that when you say no because you absolutely <br/>

I was thinking something along those lines.  Is there some way he can take off his clothes either before he comes in, or right at the door so it isn&#39;t going all the way through the house?  And maybe rinsing off outside with a hose, before coming in?  Maybe having a clothes basket right by the door and even some changes of clothes right there?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll often put towels close to the back door to help with wetness through out the house, coming in from the pool will do that pretty quick ;)<br/>

<br/>
Kids are messy.  Kids having fun are messier.  I think you need to <br/>
decide what&#39;s more important.  Is a clean house more important to <br/>
you than a happy kid?  If the answer is yes then say no to mud, but <br/>
consider that kind of prioritizing isn&#39;t compatible with unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It seems like you need to figure out what it is you believe.   If <br/>
the principles of unschooling make logical sense to you then you can <br/>
take action to live according to those principles.  If they don&#39;t, <br/>
then do something else. <br/>
<br/>
You won&#39;t be the mom of a mud playing child forever.  This time <br/>
won&#39;t last, for him or for you.  Let his joy be more important than <br/>
the clean floor. On your death bed you will never say, &quot;I wish I&#39;d <br/>
kept my house cleaner.&quot;  You will say, &quot;I wish I&#39;d played with my <br/>
kid more.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Maybe he&#39;d play in his swim trunks, if the weather is nice enough, <br/>
and hose off before he comes inside.  <br/>
Maybe he&#39;d be willing to take his clothes off at the door and hose <br/>
off. <br/>
Maybe he&#39;d take his clothes off inside the door and wipe down with a <br/>
towel.<br/>
If he doesn&#39;t like the cold hose maybe he&#39;d jump in a big  tub of <br/>
water before coming in.  You can attach a hose to an indoor spigot <br/>
for warm water.<br/>
Maybe he&#39;d use a camp shower if you hung one outside, they&#39;re nice <br/>
because the sun warms the water a little. <br/>
Maybe you can put up a little tent with a bucket inside for potty <br/>
breaks. <br/>
Maybe you can get over your worry about mud on washable surfaces. <br/>
If you&#39;re too tired to clean up the mud yet again, remember, the mud <br/>
will wait for you and in the morning when you&#39;re fresh you can clean <br/>
it up. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Someday you might want his help or understanding about something.  <br/>
If he says it&#39;s too much trouble will that be fine with you?  If he <br/>
learns that what he wants is just too much bother for you it could <br/>
damage your relationship with him.  You&#39;re son&#39;s delight and <br/>
happiness today is directly related to his happiness as a teen and <br/>
as an adult. <br/>
<br/>
My son is fifteen now but he was four once, and seven once, and nine <br/>
once, and twelve.  He played in mud and sand and water.  I know what <br/>
a mud trail is like and know it cleans up in about five minutes with <br/>
some towels and a soapy sponge that can go right into the wash. <br/>

children&#39;s play, but again, it depends. There are times your body is<br/>
truly, physically tired. I don&#39;t mean just tired of cleaning up, but<br/>
exhausted. Sure, listen to your body. Being proactive about these<br/>
activities helps honor everyone&#39;s needs.<br/>
<br/>
When you are considering how to support your child, shine the light of<br/>
death on the activity. By that, I mean ask yourself if your child (or<br/>
you) was gone tomorrow, what would be more important in this very<br/>
moment. Usually I find the energy to help them when I think of it that<br/>
way!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-333181141">What about a plastic swimming pool with warm water for<br/>
him to rinse off in?  That way it can be fun to get<br/>
all of the mud off, and then you could put an old<br/>
towel by the pool to let him dry off with.  The water<br/>
can be emptied later, and it&#39;s less stress on you and<br/>
him.<br/>

You&#39;ll  want an example – so let&#39;s say, for<br/>
example, you&#39;ve just varnished the deck  and it&#39;s still wet, and your<br/>
child wants to chalk on it right now. For both  families that just<br/>
isn&#39;t going to be possible, both will discuss options  and in both<br/>
cases there might be an happier outcome (eg child happily  chalks on<br/>
the outside wall) or a less happy outcome (child has a screaming  fit<br/>
because they really want to do it right now and can&#39;t accept  any<br/>
discussion of alternatives)discussion of alternatives)&lt;WBR&gt;. So whe<br/>
perhaps a difference in how the parents might deal with the  screaming<br/>
fit child)<br/>
 <br/>
Well, here&#39;s the problem with hypotheticals. <br/>
 <br/>
Just like I can&#39;t picture a six year old WANTING to watch porn, I can&#39;t  <br/>
imagine a child without other issues going on really throwing a screaming fit  <br/>
because they can&#39;t immediately use chalk on a freshly varnished deck. Of course,  <br/>
the magic words are &quot;other issues.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Even little kids aren&#39;t stupid. With a healthy attachment to parents, and a  <br/>
history of being treated with respect, most of the time they can understand  <br/>
reasonable, real-world limits. You stop them from running into the street,  <br/>
reminding them that cars are big and fast and can break them. Not stupid -- they  <br/>
can get that. The varnish is wet, but we can do it later when it&#39;s dry, or <br/>
you  can do it on the sidewalk. Again, not stupid.<br/>
 <br/>
If the healthy attached child is throwing a fit because of it, it&#39;s  probably <br/>
not about the chalk on the deck. She&#39;s hungry or tired or needs hugs,  or <br/>
something. Maybe it&#39;s just been a hard day. <br/>
 <br/>
People get fixated on the yeses and no&#39;s. We try hard to say yes whenever  we <br/>
can because it makes sense. You might have a hard day with a kid where there  <br/>
are lots of no&#39;s. But even the no&#39;s can be kind and reasonable. Think about <br/>
how  you would treat your partner or your best friend. It&#39;s the same thing with <br/>
your  child.<br/>
 <br/>
Ren brought up an example with Jalen that I think illustrates an important  <br/>
&quot;no.&quot; Jalen wanted to do something that Ren was just not physically up to <br/>
doing.  Rather than resenting the child and going along, she said no. I don&#39;t know <br/>
how  Jalen reacted -- maybe he was sad or angry. It&#39;s okay. Our kids can be <br/>
sad or  angry sometimes, but a genuine &quot;no&quot; will lead to more trust than a <br/>
resentful  &quot;yes.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
I want to repeat -- we say yes whenever we can BECAUSE IT MAKES SENSE!  (caps <br/>
for emphasis) Some of the conservative dooky parenting &quot;experts&quot; (I&#39;m  <br/>
thinking Dobson) insist that you should say no a lot. Why? So kids understand  they <br/>
can&#39;t always get what they want?  Again, not stupid -- they know, they  know. <br/>
 <br/>
We call this approach radical, but if you think about real relationships,  <br/>
it&#39;s really not. We just grow up being taught that children are some wild things <br/>
 that have to be broken and controlled. The problem with that is that you end <br/>
up  with an adult who is broken and doesn&#39;t have any self-control. And you <br/>
don&#39;t get  to have a real relationship with them.<br/>

understand if you took the time to walk over to the freshly varnished<br/>
deck, stoop down with child in hand and let them touch a little<br/>
corner. Or have the parent touch it and show them. A bit of time and<br/>
sharing information is all that&#39;s needed.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a big difference in that scenario, even though the result of<br/>
&quot;no you can&#39;t walk on the  deck&quot; is the same. In the mainstream world<br/>
(overgeneralizing here) the answer is just &quot;NO, you&#39;re not allowed&quot;.<br/>
The mindful parent is assuming the best of their child and getting<br/>
down on their level. Big difference in the affect on the relationship<br/>
even if the end result is &quot;no&quot;. <br/>
  <br/>
~~ Rather than resenting the child and going along, she said no. I<br/>
don&#39;t know how  Jalen reacted -- maybe he was sad or angry. It&#39;s okay.<br/>
Our kids can be sad or  angry sometimes, but a genuine &quot;no&quot; will lead<br/>
to more trust than a resentful  &quot;yes.&quot;~~<br/>
<br/>
It was a mindful &quot;no&quot; for sure. I really WANTED to go to the park with<br/>
him (this is a downtown park, not really a park at all so no other<br/>
alternative appealed to him) but between two other family members<br/>
really not feeling up to it, there was no way to make it work.<br/>
<br/>
So....Jalen was not happy. Not over the top angry or sad like he can<br/>
be, probably because he really did understand &quot;sore throat&quot; and<br/>
&quot;menstrual cycle&quot; in his own way.;) He called me a &quot;jerk&quot; when we got<br/>
in the van and I just said &quot;You know, it probably feels like I&#39;m a<br/>
jerk because we can&#39;t go to the park right now and you really want to<br/>
but I&#39;d really be a jerk if I didn&#39;t take Trevor home when he&#39;s sick.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
~~I want to repeat -- we say yes whenever we can BECAUSE IT MAKES<br/>
SENSE!  ~~<br/>
<br/>
Yes, yes, yes!!:) See...it feels GOOD to say yes. All I know, is there<br/>
is a huge shift within a person when they are looking for creative<br/>
ways to make things work, rather than finding an excuse to say &quot;no&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
It throws open the doors of communication and joy. What more could a<br/>
person want?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2052531712">Sorry but I can&#39;t help defending my mud stories now!  We home school<br/>
but are very very new to the idea of unschooling.  However, my son&#39;s<br/>
favorite choices of hobby are almost all quite messy, that&#39;s just what<br/>
interests him and has since he was about 4 yrs old.  Generally<br/>
speaking I do not restrict this, but nevertheless I do find the clear<br/>
up rounds exasperating (and sometimes draining if I&#39;m having a low<br/>
energy level day) as I am repeating the same huge clean up tasks every<br/>
day or sometimes more.  Often times the clean up lasts longer than the<br/>
time it took to make the mess.  My house is not that tidy and not that<br/>
clean as you cannot have everything - I would rather he has fun doing<br/>
that stuff freely than make him sit at a table doing something tidy.<br/>
<br/>
My mud questions were really around trying to understand the &quot;no&quot;<br/>
concept better.  So now I&#39;m wondering if maybe I have a<br/>
misunderstanding about US and &quot;no&quot; then?  My impression from websites<br/>
etc was that to try really hard not to say &quot;no&quot; is one of the<br/>
*objectives* of radical US.  Now I&#39;m wondering if it isn&#39;t just a<br/>
natural outcome of US rather than the goal in itself? - which makes a<br/>
lot more sense to me.<br/>
<br/>
I still don&#39;t see the difference between many other parenting styles<br/>
and RU though in this regard, with the wet deck scenario many non-US<br/>
families would have given that little extra thought to explaining to<br/>
the child as well, so the difference between the different parenting<br/>
styles must lie elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Would a 6 yr old have a screaming fit?  This was a made up example so,<br/>
as you say, maybe not the best one.  But my son has just turned 7 and<br/>
yes he does have screaming fits - where he shouts and dissolves into<br/>
heavy crying and is very distressed.  I can&#39;t quite gauge whether the<br/>
loud crying is just his way of letting it all out and that&#39;s that, or<br/>
whether there&#39;s more to it.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately I just can&#39;t think of a real example right now to think<br/>
about, but yes, he does respond strongly if hungry or tired, there are<br/>
other issues (or I wouldn&#39;t be here!!), and maybe it happens when I<br/>
have given an inconsistent or unreasonable &quot;no&quot; to something - I just<br/>
can&#39;t remember.  But at least I can be more alert for it next time and<br/>
try to see more clearly what is going on.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, stop there. The process starts waaaaay sooner than that. I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t put a child in that possition to begin with - especially a <br/>
child who, in the example, is impulsive and tends to get focused <br/>
very quickly. <br/>
<br/>
In my home, if something needs to be painted or stained or whatever, <br/>
George and I figure out *first* if the location is going to be <br/>
problematic, given Mo and Ray&#39;s specific needs and different <br/>
personalities. Its not uncommon for us to delay or rearrange a <br/>
project with those things in mind. <br/>
<br/>
This is part of what I mean by &quot;stretching&quot; the idea of what&#39;s <br/>
reasonable. Its not reasonable, from my perspective, to expect <br/>
either one of my kids to stay off a freshly-varnished deck. Mo would <br/>
be fascinated and want to test the finish repeatedly. Ray would try <br/>
his darnedest, but ultimately forget and walk on it. <br/>
<br/>
With this in mind, if we wanted to paint our back porch (which would <br/>
be our real life equivalent) we&#39;d first arrange for at least one of <br/>
the kids to be somewhere else for the day. With the remaining kid, <br/>
we&#39;d talk about the situation and brainstorm some solutions - <br/>
solutions that would likely involve a lot of direct interaction on <br/>
my part. <br/>
<br/>
If Mo were home, we might paint something *in addition* to the porch <br/>
for her to experiment with while the paint dried. With Ray....he&#39;s <br/>
the harder one bc he tends to get really focused. We&#39;d probably have <br/>
to construct some kind of barricade across all three entrances to <br/>
the porch *and* I&#39;d have to either stick to him like a limpit or <br/>
stay on the porch until the paint dried to remind him *why* the <br/>
barricades where there. Most likely, he&#39;d be the one we&#39;d be trying <br/>
to get out of the house for the day. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, and a child&#39;s pov is often pretty different from an adult&#39;s. <br/>
That&#39;s one of the things discussion boards like this are really <br/>
useful for - I can lay out a situation and get feedback on the <br/>
places where I may be missing the kid pov.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi Sarah.  We are relatively new to radical unschooling as well <br/>
(going on our 2nd year), and I know exactly where you are coming <br/>
from.  When I first started learning about RUS, I looked for specific <br/>
examples, trying to get an idea of what it looked like.  I&#39;m just <br/>
wired that way.  I need specifics and how to steps:)  What I&#39;ve <br/>
learned is that the details are much less important than the overall <br/>
picture.  For me, it&#39;s best that I don&#39;t focus on saying &quot;yes&quot; to <br/>
everything (however, saying yes as much as possible is a byproduct of <br/>
living a RUS life)  or get too wrapped up in if my child does... than <br/>
I should do... Instead, it&#39;s more helpful to my own journey in RUS <br/>
that I stay focused on being present with them in the moment as much <br/>
as possible (it takes alot of practice, and I&#39;m still working on it:) <br/>
and quieting my own conventional parental baggage gunk in my head and <br/>
REALLY watching and listening to my kids.  In learning who they are, <br/>
I&#39;m able to see their needs behind whatever negative behavoir they <br/>
are displaying or better yet, I&#39;m able to meet those needs before <br/>
there is a problem.  <br/>
<br/>
Another thing that is helpful for me to remember, is that this *is* a <br/>
process (I think it was Meredith and Lisa that mentioned this <br/>
before).  Sometimes I go through periods of focusing too much on the <br/>
end result of being a totally enlightened RUS mom.  I&#39;ll get <br/>
discouraged and have doubts that I&#39;ll ever get there.  This kind of <br/>
thinking usually leads to me being less mindful and present with my <br/>
kids, and of course they *feel* this and act out when their needs <br/>
aren&#39;t being met, understandably.  When RUS is really working and <br/>
flowing in our lives, it&#39;s b/c I&#39;m focused on enjoying my journey <br/>
rather than getting wrapped up in what I&#39;m not yet. <br/>
<br/>
Also, two resources that have been invaluable to me are <br/>
www.consensual-living.com and Danielle Conger&#39;s article, Rules vs <br/>
Principles  <br/>

<br/>
I think  that might set you up for disappointment. There is no &quot;there&quot;<br/>
to get to. It&#39;s all just part of a lifelong journey with our children.<br/>
Yes, there are epiphanies and shifts that come. Yes, we can look back<br/>
a few years and see how we are making better choices perhaps. But<br/>
instead of seeing some zen-like, perfect RU &quot;place&quot; to get to, maybe<br/>
see it as better choices each moment or day. That&#39;s all.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody is a perfect parent. I certainly open my mouth and hear some<br/>
really weird stuff come out (forunately my children look at me like a<br/>
martian just dropped in and I can say &quot;what was THAT about?&quot;) that<br/>
sounds like my mother!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s an unfolding. It&#39;s small shifts that add up to more joy. It&#39;s<br/>
being present and here right NOW. There isn&#39;t some plateau or &quot;there&quot;.<br/>
Enlightenment happens one choice at a time.<br/>

<br/>
You might consider whether you have unrealistic expectations of <br/>
tidiness for the mother of a busy kid.   Because he is doing what is <br/>
natural, and because you will probably not successfully change his <br/>
nature and inclination without damage to your relationship, the most <br/>
reasonable thing for you to do would be to change *your* <br/>
expectations for the state of your house while your son is a mud <br/>
enthusiast.   It is difficult and problematic to try to change <br/>
someone else or to try to get them to meet our expectations.  It is <br/>
much more effective and useful to see what we can change within and <br/>
about ourselves. <br/>
<br/>
And since most all of us on this list have at least one kid, and <br/>
since it&#39;s not unusual for kids to enjoy mud play or sandbox play, <br/>
we all have some concept of the scope of the mud coverage and the <br/>
time it takes to clean up.   You might consider whether you&#39;re <br/>
exaggerating the situation in your own mind and in your language <br/>
here in order to justify saying &quot;no&quot; to mud play.   Is it possible <br/>
that part of the reason you&#39;re focusing on when an unschooler might <br/>
say &quot;no&quot; is because you want to feel ok about sometimes limiting a <br/>
second round of mud play? <br/>
<br/>
*** trying to understand the &quot;no&quot;<br/>
concept better. ***<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re focusing on when and how and how often to say no when <br/>
you should be focusing on finding ways to enrich your child&#39;s life <br/>
with you.<br/>
<br/>
***Now I&#39;m wondering if it isn&#39;t just a<br/>
natural outcome of US rather than the goal in itself? -***<br/>
<br/>
It is not the goal of unschooling to never say no. There are times <br/>
we say no and times we all hear or experience a &quot;no.&quot;   We&#39;re not <br/>
hoping to convey to our kids that saying no is wrong.  We want our <br/>
kids to say no to creeps who want to hurt them.<br/>
But we should think about each request and situation instead of <br/>
saying an automatic &quot;no.&quot;  Consider the possibility of what your <br/>
child is asking as you&#39;d consider one of your own desires, or the <br/>
desire of a dear friend visiting your home.   Be as helpful and <br/>
thoughtful with your child as you would be to your friend or your <br/>
partner.<br/>
<br/>
The goal is to live well with our children.  To respect them, help <br/>
them, and empower them.  The idea is to think about our parenting <br/>
and make choices that build our relationship with our kids.<br/>
<br/>
Parents say no for a lot of different reasons.  Lot&#39;s of parents <br/>
believe kids *need* to hear &quot;no.&quot;  They think kids won&#39;t learn <br/>
what &quot;no&quot; means if they don&#39;t make up a lot of reasons to say no.  <br/>
Lots of parent use &quot;no&quot; as the default answer to requests out of <br/>
convenience to the parents or some other reason that has nothing <br/>
really to do with the workability of the request.  Lots of parents <br/>
operate on the &quot;Shut them down before they get out of hand&quot; <br/>
principle and unschooling rejects all of that.   Unschooling <br/>
encourages parents to help their kids do what they want to do as <br/>
much as possible and when it&#39;s not possible to be careful and <br/>
thoughtful and sympathetic.<br/>
<br/>
***I still don&#39;t see the difference between many other parenting <br/>
styles<br/>
and RU***<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you&#39;re looking for the difference.  I think you&#39;re <br/>
looking for ways unschooling might be like what you&#39;re doing, so <br/>
that you don&#39;t have to really change much in order to think of <br/>
yourself as an unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
It is different but until you&#39;re willing to really consider it and <br/>
consider why making the changes would be beneficial to your <br/>
relationship with your kid you won&#39;t see the difference. <br/>
<br/>
***But my son has just turned 7 and<br/>
yes he does have screaming fits -*** <br/>
<br/>
The point is that a kid whose folks talked to him about the deck <br/>
being unusable for a little while, whose parents considered how much <br/>
inconvenience it would be to the kid if they made the deck unusable, <br/>
whose mom or dad found another place for chalk play while the deck <br/>
was sticky, who maybe even were willing to let the deck go another <br/>
year, wouldn&#39;t feel very much like something was done *to* him when <br/>
the deck was varnished, wouldn&#39;t feel like something had been taken <br/>
from him.  <br/>
<br/>
Lots of adults have screaming fits.  Some adults still scream when <br/>
they feel overwhelmed and as if no one is listening to them or <br/>
trying to help them. Kids who&#39;ve been here much less time and who <br/>
have fewer skills for coping with stress also especially face a lot <br/>
of  little disappointments all day long with traditional parents.   <br/>
It&#39;s not surprising they sometimes feel stressed to the point of <br/>
crying. <br/>
<br/>
 *** he does respond strongly if hungry or tired, there are<br/>
other issues ***<br/>
<br/>
Many kids and maybe even most little kids are at the mercy of their <br/>
parents when it comes to getting food.  If parents get busy or <br/>
distracted, kids might not get food when they first need it.   There <br/>
have been many posts about being proactive when it comes to kids and <br/>
food.  Parents can make sure convenient foods are easily available <br/>
to kids, parents can remember to offer food regularly and they can <br/>
pay attention to their child&#39;s hunger signals so that a kid doesn&#39;t <br/>
have to get to the melt down stage before mom notices he hasn&#39;t <br/>
eaten.   All of those things help a kid feel good immediately, he <br/>
gets food, he has the considerate attention of his mom and he has <br/>
choice.  All of those things can go a long way to help in managing <br/>
or even avoiding stress. <br/>

I don&#39;t think you&#39;re looking for the difference. I think you&#39;re<br/>
looking for ways unschooling might be like what you&#39;re doing, so<br/>
that you don&#39;t have to really change much in order to think of<br/>
yourself as an unschooler. <br/>
<br/>
It is different but until you&#39;re willing to really consider it and<br/>
consider why making the changes would be beneficial to your<br/>
relationship with your kid you won&#39;t see the difference.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Deb, you have made a few assumptions about my intentions in your reply<br/>
instead of taking my post as honest and at face value - above is one <br/>
example. I can&#39;t help but find it a little insulting to ask a question<br/>
and be told (based on assumptions) that I am not ready to hear the<br/>
answer.  It would be more helpful for me and my children if my<br/>
questions were answered rather than getting into a cycle of<br/>
questionning questions etc<br/>
<br/>
Please tell me then, in the contexts in which I am asking, what is the<br/>
difference?  Perhaps there isn&#39;t one in this aspect of parenting which<br/>
I why I just don&#39;t see it?<br/>

In looking back through some of your posts this was the clearest <br/>
framing of this &quot;difference&quot; question I found:<br/>

I don&#39;t have personal knowledge of &quot;many other parenting styles,&quot;  <br/>
but I know what is typically traditional parenting.  Mainstream <br/>
parenting says kids need boundaries, discipline and consequences.  <br/>
What that translates to is kids need limits set by parents and other <br/>
authoritarian adults and they need to be disciplined by parents and <br/>
they need to endure parent (or other adult) invented punishment.    <br/>
<br/>
To traditional parents boundaries are rules and limits put in place <br/>
to ensure a child will not do what his parents don&#39;t want.  They <br/>
believe without the rules and limits a child would definitely, <br/>
willfully and habitually do wrong things.      <br/>
<br/>
Traditional parents believe children need to be disciplined (trained) <br/>
by adults in order to learn how to be responsible and good.  They <br/>
believe without the external discipline by an adult a child would <br/>
never be conscientious.   <br/>
 <br/>
Traditional parents believe that in order for a child to lean that <br/>
certain things are wrong they must suffer some punishment.  Without <br/>
consequences traditional parents believe children will strive to find <br/>
ways to &quot;get away with&quot; doing the wrong or bad things they are always <br/>
secretly hoping to do. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling parents believe kids are nice people who want to do <br/>
well.   That changes every interaction with a child.  It eliminates <br/>
the need for boundaries, discipline and consequences and makes room <br/>
for trust, support and compassion. <br/>
<br/>
I think the poster was stuck on the issue of saying no to a child, <br/>
wanting maybe, guidelines for times when &quot;no&quot; is an appropriate <br/>
response in an unschooling family.   <br/>
<br/>
John Rosemond, who has a weekly column and several books about <br/>
parenting, maintains a website called &quot;Traditional Parenting.&quot;   From <br/>
that website, here is a link to John Rosemond&#39;s bill of rights for <br/>
children:  http://rosemond.com/index.php?action=website-<br/>
view&WebSiteID=389&WebPageID=9896  where he says a child &quot;has a <br/>
right&quot; to hear &quot;no&quot; at least three times a day.   <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe having one&#39;s feelings disregarded by one&#39;s parents <br/>
builds character.  I think it builds resentment.  That&#39;s not the <br/>
relationship I&#39;m striving for with my son.   Saying no to someone for <br/>
their own character development is manipulative and patronizing and <br/>
mean.   <br/>
<br/>
I think a child should hear &quot;no&quot; as an answer to requests as little <br/>
as possible.  I think parents should work very hard to find ways to <br/>
say yes to children.  I believe people who are new on the planet need <br/>
to be facilitated in exploration and adventure and investigation as <br/>
much as possible for them to learn and grow happily and be healthy <br/>
emotionally and mentally.  <br/>
<br/>
Thinking about times when &quot;no&quot; is appropriate will side track a <br/>
person from the creative thought process of trying to find ways to <br/>
say &quot;yes.&quot;  I think it&#39;s a sticking point that ought to be got over <br/>
right quick for unschooling to bloom and grow.   If one has to have a <br/>
guideline make it to never say &quot;no&quot; automatically or arbitrarily.  <br/>
