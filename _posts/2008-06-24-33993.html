<div id="ygrps-yiv-14935976">Check out other mythology, Celtic, Egyptian, Roman, Native American,<br/>
Indian, Christian, etc. My oldest also loves mythology (it all started<br/>
with Xena, lol) and has turned into a passion over several years. She<br/>
considers herself a pantheist.<br/>
<br/>
There is a greek mythology fandex that is really cool.<br/>
<br/>
Somethings she did were, dress up, do various art projects, and<br/>
writing projects (of her own). She has reams of paper with mythology<br/>
drawings on them. She wrote her own myths etc. We went to art museums<br/>
and places with Greek god stuff.<br/>
can you Google places that might tie in somehow? Like places that have<br/>
Athena statues out front or frescoes in banks etc. She is washing<br/>
dishes with her ipod on or I would ask her. I will try to remember.<br/>
If he really likes one particular god/dess you could research that one<br/>
in depth. Find out what that one came out of and what it lead to.<br/>
celebrate holy days like they did (as far you can find out) back then.<br/>
<br/>
For us it lead into the Trojan war and then various colonizations of<br/>
different belief systems. From that we&#39;ve moved onto other wars. This<br/>
also brought in our penultimate child, who caught the love of<br/>
mythology.<br/>
<br/>
Max also got into Native American story telling which lead into<br/>
learning about our cultural hertigage...and you can go on and on. but<br/>
i&#39;ll shut up for now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2102466870">We picked up the first book on CD&#39;s at the library yesterday!  It&#39;s<br/>
too much reading for him to enjoy, but he (we) listened to 3 cd&#39;s<br/>
today!  There are 8 CD&#39;s, more than 10 hours of listening.  How&#39;s that<br/>
for attention?!?!?  LOL  Anyway, the story is GREAT so far!  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
I forgot to mention in my original post that he is 9.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1669588392">Check out the July/August issue of Calliope magazine. It&#39;s all about &quot;Zeus and his <br/>
Olympians.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Also, have you guys seen Clash of the Titans or Jason and the Argonauts? They&#39;re pretty <br/>
campy but we love them. :) Ray Harryhausen did the special effects.<br/>
<br/>
And both Odds Bodkins and Jim Weiss have terrific recordings of some of the Greek Myths. <br/>
<br/>
Best of luck!<br/>

Trojan War<br/>

Filled with great stories (and great childhood memories in the making)<br/>
according to Scotty ::bg:: just looking at the glimpse on Amazon filled him<br/>
with nostalgia!!<br/>
