<div id="ygrps-yiv-1346134294">Another thought,....<br/>
   <br/>
  One thing I&#39;ve noticed about unschooling is your community is &quot;larger&quot; but the world is somewhat &quot;smaller&quot;?? Not sure if I can explain this in words BUT here goes.... We have friends from all over &quot;not just Ohio&quot;. We visit and those unschoolers visit us (I wish more would visit us so guess I need to send out more invites. lol). It may not just be for a get together for an afternoon but for a weekend, week or more. It really just seems easy after a very short while but may sound difficult now?? Entire families visit each other or just a kid or two perhaps. It just doesn&#39;t seem odd or difficult after it happens &quot;just once&quot;. Our families could not get such a wonderful learning experience if we weren&#39;t unschooling. Our 15 year old is in North Carolina and our 10 year old is in southern Ohio with other unschooling families as I write this. So, I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is that while being in close contact with a local unschooling tribe is wonderful don&#39;t miss out on the<br/>
 great experiences you can have by allowing your community to broaden beyond a 100 mile radius or so?? Remember these are just my thoughts and meant to be helpful not as an absolute!!<br/>

  Another thing about about UWWG. I hear so far we have families coming from all over the US (which we are so excited about) not just locally. That&#39;s what was intended so everyone can&#39;t wait!! Here&#39;s the link again..<br/>

  Well, that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got to say for now.  <br/>
