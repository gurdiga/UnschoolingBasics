<div id="ygrps-yiv-1260982520">Thanks for bringing up the question about Santa and such.  My gut is telling <br/>
me not to lie to my son.  My stepson believes in Santa and the tooth fairy, <br/>
fairies, and various other things that I don&#39;t.  I certainly don&#39;t plan to burst <br/>
his bubble because that was a choice his parents made (including my DH).  <br/>
Related to the fairies, I just tell him that everyone believes different things <br/>
and that is ok.  I don&#39;t have a problem with him believing in fairies.  I&#39;ve <br/>
never seen God and I still believe he/she exists, so who am I to tell him he <br/>
can&#39;t believe in fairies just because I&#39;ve never seen one!  :)<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway... my son is under 2 and I think that stepson will find out about <br/>
Santa by the time we have to actually discuss the topic with DS so it shouldn&#39;t be <br/>
a problem.  How do you all handle relatives who talk about Santa?  My parents <br/>
won&#39;t be a problem.  They know I&#39;m sort of &quot;different&quot; (heehee) but DH&#39;s <br/>
family won&#39;t get it.  We were thinking we would just ignore it and stick with the <br/>
there-is-no-Santa thing in our own home.  Just tell him that Grandpa likes to <br/>
pretend Santa is real, or something like that.  <br/>
