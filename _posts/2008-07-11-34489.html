<div id="ygrps-yiv-1624776163"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;You offer great thoughts about honoring adoptees&#39; heritages. I  wonder how<br/>
 </span></blockquote>this might be extended, or not, to other kinds of cultural  associations,<br/>
such as signing and Deaf culture. Hearing parents may have a  deaf<br/>
child—we&#39;ve got a few here on this list, I believe—so how does this  apply?&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
At some point this sort of came up in our family, even  before we welcomed a <br/>
new black child into our midst. Julian has grown up in a  lesbian household, <br/>
and is comfortable with gay culture. One of his first jobs  was with <br/>
MassEquality, canvassing to keep same sex marriage legal in  Massachusetts. When he was <br/>
going to his first residency at Goddard he checked  &quot;no preference&quot; with the <br/>
type of dorm accommodations, as he was fine with the  gay floor, the men&#39;s <br/>
floor, or the mixed sex floor. (He didn&#39;t want an early to  bed floor LOL) His <br/>
first friend when he got to Goddard was a middle-aged female  to male transexual <br/>
truck driver who looked and sounded like every stereotypic  redneck male <br/>
southern trucker you&#39;ve ever imagined.<br/>
 <br/>
He&#39;s straight, but he has grown up in a Queer culture. (I can say that--  I&#39;m <br/>
one of them. And Julian knows when he can say it and when he can&#39;t,  too.)<br/>
 <br/>
And we&#39;re learning more and embracing more as we have welcomed Sadel, who  <br/>
has a Haitian-American heritage.<br/>
