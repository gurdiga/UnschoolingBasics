<div>I read your question and then I read some of the responses.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I think you will find varying levels of tolerance for diversity in defining unschooling within the unschooling community and larger hsing community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Some of us are less strict about how unschooling is defined, see it as a process, a growth, a meme to be evolved into perhaps. Some are pretty strict about how they define unschooling -- if you aren&#39;t all the way there yet, you aren&#39;t there. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There are probably a bunch of unschoolers who are just busy unschooling and not busy defining things. :)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I tend not to care how others define it if it doesn&#39;t impact me. And mostly it doesn&#39;t. I know I am a LOT more unschool-y than I was when I started hsing (gad, I was trying to follow the state standards!!). I know I have evolved in my thinking and how we operate as a family. I know hearing people talk who are extremely sure how things should work can occasionally&nbsp;be helpful -- if not something I want to have in my face all the time. I know there are folks who talk about an ideal sort of way to be in the world that they think of as unschooling. I&#39;m not there -- but I still call myself an unschooler and think I am an unschooler.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>For instance, some might not approve of my nudging the kids to remember various things they need to do for classes they are taking. Heck, they might not approve of the idea of classes. :) But I don&#39;t need their approval to know I am doing fine and the kids are doing fine in our personal, custom-made version of unschooling. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Now, the question was how tolerant are unschoolers of&nbsp;other unschoolers? Hmmm . .&nbsp;. sometimes not very. But sometimes we get it -- that not everyone does it the same way. So I guess we are diverse in our tolerance of diversity. :)</div>

 </span></blockquote>I think asking &quot;Is this unschooling&quot; is interesting and often leads to <br/>
new insights.<br/>
However, I don&#39;t give a rat&#39;s patootie whether or not somebody else <br/>
thinks we&#39;re unschooling correctly or not &lt;G&gt;. Defining unschooling is <br/>
useful for discussion purposes - and sometimes for letting other <br/>
homeschoolers know that we won&#39;t be exchanging curriculum ideas with <br/>
them &lt;G&gt; - but the purpose of defining it is not to decide &quot;who is&quot; and <br/>
&quot;who isn&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m assuming Nance meant classes the kids want to take - not something <br/>
imposed on them. I&#39;m thinking of the Japanese language class that my <br/>
daughter took when she was about 10, as an example. She was supposed to <br/>
memorize certain things during the week between classes.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see nudging the kids to get their stuff done as a problem - <br/>
unless it IS a problem &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry - but that made sense to me when I thought it.<br/>
<br/>
What I mean is - if it is a case of mom being better able to keep track <br/>
of what is coming up and what they were supposed to do and so on - then <br/>
it wouldn&#39;t be nice to hold out on the kids, not help them remember <br/>
what they need to do. And I&#39;d include in that also making sure they had <br/>
time to do it and encouraging them to take the time to do it. Mom knows <br/>
if the kids will be sorry they didn&#39;t get to it.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, if the kids don&#39;t WANT to do it - so its a problem <br/>
getting them to do it - then I&#39;d say &quot;making them&quot; would be the <br/>
anti-thesis of unschooling.<br/>
