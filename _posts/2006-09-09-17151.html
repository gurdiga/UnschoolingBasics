<div id="ygrps-yiv-714449081">Hello, I have sent in to the group before and everyone has wonderful responses. I have something to say, again. Before I decided to try unschooling my 2 boys I sent for the CAT Test, it has came in and the boys have started taking it. My oldest, 17yrs, can&#39;t seem to test for anything. He hates testing but the cover school I&#39;m under requires the children to pass this test before he will allow them to graduate. What am I suppose to do since my son can&#39;t seem to test? Is testing even required in Alabama or is it just this cover school? Or if someone has any ideas to help him pass this test please send them my way. He was hoping he could graduate in May, he&#39;s actually in 11th grade this year. As we were looking at the test everything was what he had done in 9th and 10th grades. I&#39;m lost and hope someone out there can help. <br/>
  Blessings, Cynthia<br/>

Alabama:<br/>

Also there&#39;s other good info on homeschooling on nhen.org.<br/>
<br/>
Are you new to unschooling, or if not, how long?<br/>
Hopefully someone here is from your state (I&#39;m in MA!)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>First there is no testing requirement in the state of Alabama.  This is<br/>
STRICTLY something from your cover.  I would look for a new (and more<br/>
unschooling friendly) cover.  Dayspring is very unschooling friendly and who<br/>
we will use when/if we ever move back to Alabama.<br/>
<br/>
If you are unschooling there are no &quot;grade levels.&quot;  What is your son&#39;s rush<br/>
to &quot;graduate?&quot;  What is he &quot;graduating to?&quot;  Is he wanting to go to on to<br/>
college?  Is he just wanting to be finished with school?  Is he 16 yet? (If<br/>
so he is no longer required to even be in school!)   If college is his goal<br/>
he can most likely take classes already at the community or junior college<br/>
level.  If work is his goal then he is old enough to start looking for a<br/>
job.  Deschool, get rid of grades and forget testing that isn&#39;t required!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-380836031">Thanks for information ladies. I have finally received relief from the testing issue. I called my coordinator and she told me to not worry about what the test says. She said help him with the problems he needs help with or help him with all the problems. She said to give him all the examples that he needed me to give him. She knows me very well and she told me that she knows I teach my son very well. She also said Cody may have testing phobia and not all children can test. Cody also has ADHD so this makes testing much more difficult. So after all the worry we will not have to worry about testing after all. Thanks so much, Cynthia<br/>

<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t about teaching anyone. It&#39;s about learning together<br/>
all the time...it&#39;s a lifestyle and as soon as you can let go of the<br/>
idea that children need to be taught, the sooner unschooling will make<br/>
sense.<br/>
<br/>
People are born to learn, it&#39;s how we&#39;re wired. Learning will happen<br/>
naturally as people pursue their interests. Just feed whatever it is<br/>
that fascinates him at the moment and unschooling will blossom in your<br/>
lives.:)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ok I&#39;m kind of jumping in here but I have to share this..  today my 4 <br/>
year old and I were giving our 6 month old a bath and the 4 year old <br/>
was pointing out that the baby was learning to grab a hold of things.  <br/>
Then he asked &quot;How did baby learn that on his own&quot;  or something to <br/>
that affect... anyway it made me think of what unschooling is about.. <br/>
children learn on there own.  Did I &quot;model&quot; this progress for the <br/>
baby? or did he learn this by memory?  Either way I just had to share <br/>
and I hope I make to sense to some of you.</div>
