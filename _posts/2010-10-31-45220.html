<div id="ygrps-yiv-828248829">Hi,  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading posts on this group since late winter and have posted a few times.  I agree with a number of radical unschooling principles and am trying to apply time with my family.  However, I am struggling with how these principles apply to groups.  <br/>
<br/>
There are times, when one is part of a group, that the individual has to put aside their own needs/wants for the good of the group.  In otherwords, how does a group build community without asking anything of its members?  At what point does the individual&#39;s needs end and the groups needs take over?  Or do we only participate in groups as long as our own needs/wants are being met and just jump ship when the group isn&#39;t meeting our needs?  Is it OK to segregate into smaller groups within the larger group, when our needs/wants aren&#39;t being met by the larger group, therefore excluding others in the process?  <br/>
<br/>
Just looking for some philosophical perspective on this.  I agree with the principles of respecting and trusting our children when it comes to learning and even with making personal choices, such as which activities to participate in.  But, once they are part of a group, shouldn&#39;t they be encouraged to participate in that group fully and in a way that is respectful of all members of the group?  If they want to just have time alone with their friends and not participate in group activities or not include all members in their play, etc., then shouldn&#39;t they do that outside of the group at another time?  Just trying to put it all together and wondering how radical unschooling principles apply to group situations.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1767453219">Why is this your problem? Your children have chosen to participate in X group activity and now you see that they chat with friends within the group or do something else that doesn&#39;t jibe with how you think the group should be functioning. Either they will continue to enjoy participating or they won&#39;t. Either the group tolerates some amount of whatever behavior it is that you don&#39;t approve of or it doesn&#39;t. If it doesn&#39;t, they will be told. And they will sort it out, either continuing or not. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe they will learn not to do something. Maybe they will just enjoy the ebb and flow of a group that is not all that danged serious. Either way, they will have the experience. Not you. And that is respectful to them and maybe, just maybe, trusting them to know how to behave and interact will translate to them not being that annoying kid who talks during the instruction part of the activity. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe they need a small heads up that while doing X activity it is normally polite to be quiet and listen and let others listen during a particular time. Maybe they need to be told that the activity leader will ask all of you to leave if they are too disruptive, if that&#39;s the case -- where the line is. And that they can see their friends at another time if this activity isn&#39;t really all it&#39;s cracked up to be. <br/>
<br/>
But then they need to do it themselves. <br/>
<br/>
All of this assumes they are mature enough to understand. That you are not putting them in a situation they are not capable of participating in -- something designed for older kids, for instance.<br/>

Or do we only participate in groups as long as our own needs/wants are being met and just jump ship when the group isn&#39;t meeting our needs?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>From my perspective, I see group membership as something that is voluntary. If a group is meeting the needs of the participants, the then participants will stay and do what is asked. If a group isn&#39;t meeting those needs, then why can&#39;t a person just leave the group? What is the purpose of staying in a group that isn&#39;t meeting your needs? As an adult, I can see where it would be a good idea to honor commitments if you are in a group and have made some kind of agreement or promise to the group. For children, I feel like if a group is meeting the child&#39;s needs, then the child will want to continue to go to that group and do what is asked. I think it is perfectly acceptable for groups to ask for help or participation from the members. If the members want to be there and like what is going on, they will be more than willing to do what is asked. I think the discussion of groups can be a slippery slope. I think it is essential for a person to be able to know when to walk away from a group. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Is it OK to segregate into smaller groups within the larger group, when our needs/wants aren&#39;t being met by the larger group, therefore excluding others in the process?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is really going to depend on the type of group and the overall purpose of the group. I can see where segregating into smaller groups within the larger group would be very helpful. Isn&#39;t that what a committee is? Committees exclude others all of the time so that they can put more focus on one particular activity or topic. What do you mean by excluding? Are you talking about the process of ignoring or snubbing other members or are you talking about not actively engaging the other members? <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But, once they are part of a group, shouldn&#39;t they be encouraged to participate in that group fully and in a way that is respectful of all members of the group? &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Most groups have rules or expectations of its members. A person should be aware of those expectations before joining a group. If a child isn&#39;t old enough to understand or meet those expectations, I don&#39;t see how encouraging them to participate would be helpful to the individual or the group. I have joined groups where I thought the expectations were one thing but once I got actively involved, I found out that they were actually something very different than what I originally thought. Sometimes, the most respectful thing to do is to walk away from a group. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;If they want to just have time alone with their friends and not participate in group activities or not include all members in their play, etc., then shouldn&#39;t they do that outside of the group at another time?

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All of this is going to depend on the dynamics of the specific group. Some groups have very rigid rules and expectations and some groups do not. I don&#39;t think there is one right answer here because groups can be formed with very strict rules or with very loose rules. What is the purpose of the group? What are the individuals expectations of the group? What are the groups expectations of the individual? From my understanding, a kid should be allowed to choose whether or not to participate in groups. If a child wants to participate, then they should follow the rules that are set out by the group with the caveat that there is always the option of leaving the group.<br/>

mothers set kids up to play together, but the primary group are the mothers<br/>
who want to socialize.  The kids may or may not be a part of the group, or<br/>
rather, see themselves as part of a group because they are not getting their<br/>
needs met by the group.  If this is so, then it&#39;s not hard to see how<br/>
certain children might want to split off from the &quot;gathering&quot; of kids and<br/>

egocentric.  They aren&#39;t going to &quot;get&quot; that they have an obligation to the<br/>
other 3 yr olds to play soccer or whatever.  They are going to be all about<br/>

trying to ask something about a group your kid is in, ask yourself if your<br/>
kid feels that sense of duty to purpose of the group.  Does your kid trust<br/>
the others?  If there is no trust or interdependence in that gathering of<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-972778940">Thank you all for responding.  <br/>
<br/>
I realized I was being vague.  My concerns are in reference to a homeschooling group that we attend where we like everyone very much, but I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s a good fit for us.  <br/>
<br/>
Some of your comments have helped clarify things for me.  I think what is catching me up is the definition of a group.  It&#39;s called a homeschooling co-op.  We do have a planned activity, but it is optional for the kids, so it really is more of a gathering/play group.  Previously, we belonged to a group that was more structured and where we did more community building activities.  So, that is where my hang up is.  <br/>
<br/>
BTW, my kids aren&#39;t forced to go.  They want to go.  But, they frequently get their feelings hurt by the smaller groups of kids, who for whatever reason, don&#39;t want to include them.  (My kids aren&#39;t perfect angels, and aren&#39;t always inclusive themselves.)  In general, I&#39;d say all the kids are there, because they want to be, but I can&#39;t speak for every family in the group.  <br/>
<br/>
Just trying to figure this out in my own mind, where individual wants/needs end, and group needs begin.  But, as you say, a gathering isn&#39;t a group, and therefore, doesn&#39;t really have a common goal, other than socializing.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1663611415">Ah, I had read it the other way -- that your kids were the ones in the smaller groups. <br/>
<br/>
So your question is how to get other kids to invite your children into their smaller groups?<br/>
<br/>
Or ???<br/>
<br/>
I think this is going to happen whenever people get together and it&#39;s part of learning how group activities function. We can&#39;t force others to include us in their inner circles. And vice versa.<br/>
<br/>
But we also don&#39;t have to sit there feeling hurt and excluded. We can participate and build our own friendships.<br/>
<br/>
And we can stop judging whether any of this makes any of these people &quot;perfect angels.&quot; It doesn&#39;t.<br/>

&gt; BTW, my kids aren&#39;t forced to go.  They want to go.  But, they frequently get their feelings hurt by the smaller groups of kids, who for whatever reason, don&#39;t want to include them.  (My kids aren&#39;t perfect angels, and aren&#39;t always inclusive themselves.)  In general, I&#39;d say all the kids are there, because they want to be, but I can&#39;t speak for every family in the group.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just trying to figure this out in my own mind, where individual wants/needs end, and group needs begin.  But, as you say, a gathering isn&#39;t a group, and therefore, doesn&#39;t really have a common goal, other than socializing.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>How old are the kids in question? What do you mean when you say that the smaller groups don&#39;t want to include them? Are the other kids mean about it or do they just not invite your kids to participate? Do your kids make any effort to join the smaller groups? I know that my oldest daughter will sometimes get upset because groups don&#39;t include her. I have watched her interactions and I notice that she does nothing to actively try to participate. She will stand around and act shy and hope somebody invites her to join them. If they don&#39;t, then she gets her feelings hurt.  I talk to my daughter about her options when she feels like she is not being included. Whether or not the kids are perfect angels is irrelevant.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I am confused by this statement. If this is a homeschool co-op that does not require kids to participate in the activity, then what is the goal of the group? Does the group have any sort of requirements or guidelines at all? Most homeschool groups have some kind of guidelines. There is one group in my area that is pretty much just a social group that meets at the park on Fridays. They post guidelines about what is expected. If somebody feels that those guidelines aren&#39;t being followed, then somebody speaks up and it is addressed. From your post, it is hard to tell whether or not you are describing kids being selective about who they hang out with or if there is something more serious going on. <br/>
