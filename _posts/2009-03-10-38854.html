son, which includes unschooling him--&quot;homeschooling&quot; to them (the term<br/>
unschooling, as well as the lifestyle choice, would be too threatening a<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-54678011">Well, we get tons of requests for school pictures. So we try to make sure we take pictures (I am missing a working digi cam right now and have been using disposable ones we get developed on CD at Walmart) and send them to everyone. I fix them up myself and we take pictures of everything. Our family is about 6 hours away from us so we upload to Walgreens, pay for the prints that they have requested and they can pick them up when it is convenient for them. This is accomplishing two things. Everyone gets current pictures and it displays the things that they are doing. We have taken pictures of our daughter engrossed in a book. Our son building blocks, field trips, park days, you name it. They get to see &quot;school&quot; photos and see that the kids are not just sitting doing nothing, though there are plenty of those as well come to think of it. We have even taken pictures of art work or scanned it in and done the same thing. It has lessened the negative attitude on<br/>
 many sides. As for the always present question on socialization I have pictures of the kids playing with their friends, talking to the librarian, etc. Excellent documentary of their lives. I also often email my daughter&#39;s writings that she chooses to different family members. I have taken down short stories my son has come up with and sent those as well. I make sure everyone has access to our homeschool blog, which needs updating. <br/>
<br/>
It is a lot of work but we get to show off everything, we have fun and well the family is coming around to our side slowly but surely. Of course my younger brothers, who are not parents themsevles yet, have always thought Sissy was weird so their views are nothing new.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1274890754">Hi, we actually participated in a &quot;Homeschool Picture Day&quot; that a local homeschool family put on (the dad has a studio set up in their garage).  We got the full package of photos -- wallet size on up.  I&#39;m assuming you could do the same thing at a commercial photo place...<br/>
<br/>
I know the photo thing is only one little part, but maybe for your relatives it&#39;s important to have &quot;things&quot; they can show their friends about their grandkids...and the photo is tangible proof of something?  Hmmm...<br/>
<br/>
We have a similar situation with my MIL...we just don&#39;t talk about our home (un) schooling life with her...just try to focus on all the cool, fun, &quot;educational&quot; things we are doing (she&#39;s a former school teacher...).  So I feel your pain!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-105600032">Thank you Tammy and Meredith,<br/>
<br/>
We do have a family blog, but we have not invited my husband&#39;s parents to<br/>
view it because we are afraid of their reaction.  I was thinking of sending<br/>
them a small book of photos dedicated to activities we have done this year,<br/>
with little blurbs about what we were doing and what we enjoyed.<br/>
<br/>
Just today we sent them a school-like photo we took here at home.  Ethan<br/>
wrote them a little note to go with it, with lots of coloured pens.  We had<br/>
fun with it.<br/>
<br/>
My son is confused and thinks that his grandparents don&#39;t remember who he<br/>
is.  This is what he has told us.  As I mentioned, we haven&#39;t been in close<br/>
contact with them for a couple years.  We talked to Ethan about how it is<br/>
difficult for some people to understand different ways of living in the<br/>
world when they feel sure that their way is best, and assured him that they<br/>
do remember him and think the world of him.  I think that my husband&#39;s<br/>
parents think that we are making a big mistake, and they are worried that<br/>
Ethan will suffer somehow because of our choices.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I could try monthly updates in the mail.  They don&#39;t like emails.  I<br/>
have to admit, I am a bit nervous.  I have been the biggest brunt of their<br/>
criticism, and I feel vulnerable an defensive.  I don&#39;t want to let that<br/>
stop me though.  It would be great if I could help mend this relationship.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the suggestions and the time you have taken to reply.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Perhaps I could try monthly updates in the mail.  They don&#39;t like emails.. . &quot;<br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t like emails. They demand &quot;school&quot; pictures. They criticize and otherwise seem not to accept the decisions that have been made by their adult children. <br/>
<br/>
And they have hurt and confused their grandchild!<br/>
<br/>
These are the sort of people who don&#39;t get pictures or a civil response of any kind, after a very short while. <br/>
<br/>
How about, here are some pictures online. Here&#39;s an email. That&#39;s all I have time for because I adore my children and want to spend time with them and we don&#39;t do school, we enjoy life, and if that&#39;s sooooo hard to understand, then you just have more to bitch and moan about. <br/>
<br/>
And put that burden down and get on with having fun with the family, snapping pix when you want and sending them to people who are making some sort of decent effort to care about the people you actually are instead of their idea of what you should be.<br/>
<br/>
I told you they were ticking me off. :)<br/>

I thought it was so beautiful. I sent it to her and put that it was the first day of school.  I told her that they learned more on that day than most kids learn in a month.  I felt the photo was a TRUE SCHOOL PHOTO.  She didn&#39;t get my point, but I enjoyed rubbing it in her face anyway :) Also, I have taken them to parks and taken nice close up photos with the trees in the back ground.  Of course they are wearing homeschooling shirts.  I send those.  They say that pictures are worth a thousand words.  <br/>

<br/>
Truthfully, I have been longing to hear this kind of response from someone,<br/>
because I wanted to know that my feelings of frustration were not unique to<br/>
me.  So, thanks for that!<br/>
<br/>
However, we have tried not communicating with them beyond the need-to-knows<br/>
for a couple years, and that doesn&#39;t seem to affect them.  Obviously the<br/>
criticizing and guilt stopped, but only for lack of words spoken, but not in<br/>
any meaningful long-lasting way.  As soon as the communication resumed, the<br/>
same problems resumed.  I would like our family to have a civil relationship<br/>
with my in-laws.  I would like my son, especially, to have one.  They do<br/>
have good qualities, and can be very generous.  I would like Ethan to know<br/>
that side of them.  My fear is that it comes at a cost.  This behaviour has<br/>
had a lasting effect on my husband, which is why he is willing to walk away<br/>
from the relationship.<br/>
<br/>
My own mom suggested I just keep interactions at a minimum and talk with<br/>
Ethan about the situation--explain to him that they just don&#39;t understand<br/>
our way of life, but that they do care about him.  My mom suggested that if<br/>
they say something that we are uncomfortable with, just ignore them.  We are<br/>
not likely to change their opinion.  This is hard for me.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone for all you ideas and support!  I really appreciate it<br/>
very much.  It is comforting to know that there are people who support each<br/>
other in all their colourful glory!<br/>
<br/>
All the best, and thanks again.<br/>
<br/>
Karen, Doug and Ethan.<br/>

If you decide to include them in your life, it might be helpful to stop taking *their* opinions to heart.  Stop trying to please them.  If you aren&#39;t worried about how they think you should run your life, then you can enjoy the things you love about each other.  In other words, give them acceptance to have their concerns and fears just like you are wishing them to give to you.<br/>

They may someday change, they may not.  Can you live with that?  Only your family can decide if the positives outweigh the negatives.  <br/>
<br/>
One thing I&#39;ve heard people do is turn conversations around.  Like if your in-laws ask why you decided to homeschool or ask if school would be better for Ethan, you could say, &quot;Are you concerned that he is missing out on something he would experience in school?&quot;  They will give an answer.  You keep turning the questions on to them and at some point thank them for their concern and caring about your son.  I bet it is hard for some people to see their children making very different choices then they made and that of the majority of the culture, esp if they were conformists trying to fit in and do what was expected of them.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, if your in-laws were not treated with trust growing up, they might have difficulty trusting your husband to make the *right* decisions.  And that is their issue.  But only your family can decide if you can deal with it or not.  Best of luck.     Laurie</div>

<br/>
I understand where you&#39;re coming from, but at least it sounds as if your side of the family is supportive, which is great!  In our house, my wife and I made a rule - she deals with her screwed up family and I deal with mine.  That&#39;s helped a great deal.<br/>
<br/>
My family is a little easier to deal with, since I taught them from the time I was seven or eight that I would make up my own mind, follow my own path, and woe to the person, parent or otherwise, who tried to interfere with me once I&#39;d decided on something.  I&#39;m not nice when pushed and don&#39;t tolerate second guessing very well.  So my family knows to tiptoe around things and generally confine themselves to asking nosey but relatively harmless questions.  We don&#39;t live near them, so they&#39;re not so large a problem.<br/>
<br/>
My wife&#39;s family requires a more direct approach.  We do live near them and they&#39;re far more open in their criticism of my wife&#39;s choices, from politics to religion to parenting, you name it, we violate their standards.  So we have to take an aggressive line with them.  We&#39;re totally up front about it.  These are the things we do.  These are the acceptable boundaries.  Do not cross them.  Whether or not you continue to have a relationship with your grandchildren is totally up to you.  If forcing other people to abide by your beliefs is more important to you than your relationships to those people, then feel free to live alone with your beliefs.  I&#39;m just not willing to let my children be criticized and judged and harassed by other people, even if those people are relatives.  I sort of follow a simple rule - if I wouldn&#39;t let a stranger treat my child in such and such a way, why would I allow a relative to do so?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not very conciliatory about these kinds of things.  It&#39;s about boundaries.  These are my boundaries.  Respect them or move on.  You don&#39;t get extra chances to violate my boundaries just because you&#39;re family. <br/>
<br/>
So what we had to do, with both sides of the family, was create a space, closely supervised, where our kids could have positive interactions with their grandparents and uncles and aunts and cousins. As soon as things took a bad turn, we left.  And we had to be very clear with people that having that space depended on them respecting our boundaries.  And I had to be willing, emotionally, to let a relationship go if they just can&#39;t find it in themselves to respect my choices.  <br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t easy or pleasant but I&#39;ve always believed that the only way to deal with people like this, in the long run, is to insist that this is who I am, these are my decisions, this is how my family works, so respect it or else.  I haven&#39;t found that making concessions to other people&#39;s beliefs has ever helped in the long run - it only emboldens them to expect more.</div>
