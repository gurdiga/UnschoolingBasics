<div id="ygrps-yiv-582446412">&quot;Are unschoolers saying that<br/>
they can ALWAYS trust their children to make the best choice&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Can I always trust MYSELF to make the best choice? Yes and no. <br/>
I always (as do my children) TRY to make the best choice with the<br/>
tools and experience I have in the moment. Hindsight often shows me<br/>
where I could have done it better or different, that&#39;s what we call<br/>
learning.:)<br/>
<br/>
I trust that my children are doing the best they can under the<br/>
circumstances. I don&#39;t trust they always have the tools and experience<br/>
necessary to navigate every situation, and that&#39;s why they need<br/>
parents to assist them. ASSIST, not force. I can get downright<br/>
coercive if I need to keep a person safe or stop anything physical<br/>
between my children. Coercive can still be done in a more respectful<br/>
manner though.........no, I&#39;m not going to let you hit your sister,<br/>
but yes, I understand how upset you are right now let&#39;s get some space<br/>
from this situation type thing.<br/>
<br/>
Sunscreen is overrated if you ask me! It gives people a false sense of<br/>
safety in regards to UV rays. You are still bombarded with the cancer<br/>
causing rays, so I don&#39;t think it needs to be an either/or situation.<br/>
Anytime we draw a sand in the line and say &quot;don&#39;t cross this or else&quot;<br/>
we are setting up an adversarial situation. Doesn&#39;t need to happen<br/>
that way. Joyce explained it so thoroughly and clearly I&#39;m not even<br/>
going to attempt another explanation.:)<br/>
<br/>
The movie issue; we have children that have a variety of taste in<br/>
movies. My two older still enjoy some pretty violent films, with no<br/>
ill effects. My 9y.o. does not enjoy extreme violence, but is<br/>
beginning to be less sensitive to movie violence as she gets older. My<br/>
5 y.o. is not bothered by much of anything.<br/>
<br/>
Deciding what they can and can&#39;t watch based on age would be<br/>
pointless. What I HAVE done is warn them about content and be present<br/>
for them. It isn&#39;t the end of the world to see something a bit beyond<br/>
your comfort zone when you know the adults in the home are going to<br/>
support you and help you cope with it. My children don&#39;t have any<br/>
desire to watch the things that bother them, since it IS their choice<br/>
and I&#39;m here to facilitate anything that fascinates them rather than<br/>
forbid it.<br/>
