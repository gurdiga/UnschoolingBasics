<div id="ygrps-yiv-1132556384">I&#39;m so happy to see the posts regarding kids and errands, <br/>
either &quot;making&quot; kids go or considering how they feel about going with <br/>
you. My son (9yo) has ALWAYS been resistant to running errands, <br/>
whether he was in school or now that we&#39;ve been homeschooling a few <br/>
months. I find that sometimes it is just me that wants to get out of <br/>
the house or &quot;get something done&quot;, and usually it can wait til later <br/>
in the day or the weekend when I can go myself. He is one of <br/>
those &quot;vocal&quot; kids, who lets me know what he wants and does not want, <br/>
and I am glad for it. I always wondered how other people seemed to get <br/>
things done taking their kids with them, is it just me or my kid or <br/>
what? So it&#39;s good to hear that not everyone&#39;s kids just &quot;go along&quot; <br/>
with the whole errand thing. And you know, if I don&#39;t force him, or <br/>
maybe it&#39;s just now that he&#39;s older, he will work with me on going if <br/>
it is something we &quot;have&quot; to do, like something with a time deadline <br/>
or a doctor&#39;s appt for me or something. <br/>
Thanks for all the posts on this subject.<br/>
Amy</div>
