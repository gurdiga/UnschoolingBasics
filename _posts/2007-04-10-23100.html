<div id="ygrps-yiv-984524247">I would like to think we would be different in this situation.  Certainly <br/>
that we wouldn&#39;t push our kids away from the magic of the moment.  If you <br/>
have the time...it&#39;s an interesting read that was forwarded to me via <br/>
another homeschooling parent.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;A story ran in The Washington Post this week -- on Easter Sunday -- that<br/>
&gt;just blew me away. It&#39;s one of the most powerful pieces of journalism I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;ever encountered -- not just because of the great writing and reporting, <br/>
&gt;but<br/>
&gt;because of the things that are happening in the story. It&#39;s a sociological<br/>
&gt;experiment that gives rich new meaning to the phrase &quot;Wake up and smell the<br/>
&gt;roses&quot; -- or, as the writer of the story puts it, discerning &quot;the moral <br/>
&gt;math<br/>
&gt;of the moment.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In a nutshell, the Post convinced one of the world&#39;s greatest violinists to<br/>
&gt;go incognito and play his fiddle at a Metro station, standing there with <br/>
&gt;his<br/>
&gt;open case like just another street musician, begging for money. He was<br/>
&gt;playing some of the most beautiful and complex violin pieces from history,<br/>
&gt;things that people shell out $100 and put on their Sunday best to go see in<br/>
&gt;a concert hall. But would anyone appreciate him -- or his music -- as<br/>
&gt;essentially a street corner beggar, even though the same gorgeous music was<br/>
&gt;being played?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The results are astonishing. Check it out:<br/>

&gt;Pearls Before Breakfast<br/>
&gt;Can one of the nation&#39;s great musicians cut through the fog of a D.C. rush<br/>
&gt;hour? Let&#39;s find out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;By Gene Weingarten<br/>
&gt;Washington Post Staff Writer<br/>
&gt;Sunday, April 8, 2007; W10<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;HE EMERGED FROM THE METRO AT THE L&#39;ENFANT PLAZA STATION AND POSITIONED<br/>
&gt;HIMSELF AGAINST A WALL BESIDE A TRASH BASKET. By most measures, he was<br/>
&gt;nondescript: a youngish white man in jeans, a long-sleeved T-shirt and a<br/>
&gt;Washington Nationals baseball cap. From a small case, he removed a violin.<br/>
&gt;Placing the open case at his feet, he shrewdly threw in a few dollars and<br/>
&gt;pocket change as seed money, swiveled it to face pedestrian traffic, and<br/>
&gt;began to play.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It was 7:51 a.m. on Friday, January 12, the middle of the morning rush <br/>
&gt;hour.<br/>
&gt;In the next 43 minutes, as the violinist performed six classical pieces,<br/>
&gt;1,097 people passed by. Almost all of them were on the way to work, which<br/>
&gt;meant, for almost all of them, a government job. L&#39;Enfant Plaza is at the<br/>
&gt;nucleus of federal Washington, and these were mostly mid-level bureaucrats<br/>
&gt;with those indeterminate, oddly fungible titles: policy analyst, project<br/>
&gt;manager, budget officer, specialist, facilitator, consultant.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Each passerby had a quick choice to make, one familiar to commuters in any<br/>
&gt;urban area where the occasional street performer is part of the cityscape:<br/>
&gt;Do you stop and listen? Do you hurry past with a blend of guilt and<br/>
&gt;irritation, aware of your cupidity but annoyed by the unbidden demand on<br/>
&gt;your time and your wallet? Do you throw in a buck, just to be polite? Does<br/>
&gt;your decision change if he&#39;s really bad? What if he&#39;s really good? Do you<br/>
&gt;have time for beauty? Shouldn&#39;t you? What&#39;s the moral mathematics of the<br/>
&gt;moment?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;On that Friday in January, those private questions would be answered in an<br/>
&gt;unusually public way. No one knew it, but the fiddler standing against a<br/>
&gt;bare wall outside the Metro in an indoor arcade at the top of the <br/>
&gt;escalators<br/>
&gt;was one of the finest classical musicians in the world, playing some of the<br/>
&gt;most elegant music ever written on one of the most valuable violins ever<br/>
&gt;made. His performance was arranged by The Washington Post as an experiment<br/>
&gt;in context, perception and priorities -- as well as an unblinking <br/>
&gt;assessment<br/>
&gt;of public taste: In a banal setting at an inconvenient time, would beauty<br/>
&gt;transcend?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The musician did not play popular tunes whose familiarity alone might have<br/>
&gt;drawn interest. That was not the test. These were masterpieces that have<br/>
&gt;endured for centuries on their brilliance alone, soaring music befitting <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;grandeur of cathedrals and concert halls.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The acoustics proved surprisingly kind. Though the arcade is of utilitarian<br/>
&gt;design, a buffer between the Metro escalator and the outdoors, it somehow<br/>
&gt;caught the sound and bounced it back round and resonant. The violin is an<br/>
&gt;instrument that is said to be much like the human voice, and in this<br/>
&gt;musician&#39;s masterly hands, it sobbed and laughed and sang -- ecstatic,<br/>
&gt;sorrowful, importuning, adoring, flirtatious, castigating, playful,<br/>
&gt;romancing, merry, triumphal, sumptuous.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So, what do you think happened?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;HANG ON, WE&#39;LL GET YOU SOME EXPERT HELP.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Leonard Slatkin, music director of the National Symphony Orchestra, was<br/>
&gt;asked the same question. What did he think would occur, hypothetically, if<br/>
&gt;one of the world&#39;s great violinists had performed incognito before a<br/>
&gt;traveling rush-hour audience of 1,000-odd people?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Let&#39;s assume,&quot; Slatkin said, &quot;that he is not recognized and just taken for<br/>
&gt;granted as a street musician . . . Still, I don&#39;t think that if he&#39;s really<br/>
&gt;good, he&#39;s going to go unnoticed. He&#39;d get a larger audience in Europe . . <br/>
&gt;.<br/>
&gt;but, okay, out of 1,000 people, my guess is there might be 35 or 40 who <br/>
&gt;will<br/>
&gt;recognize the quality for what it is. Maybe 75 to 100 will stop and spend<br/>
&gt;some time listening.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So, a crowd would gather?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Oh, yes.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And how much will he make?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;About $150.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks, Maestro. As it happens, this is not hypothetical. It really<br/>
&gt;happened.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;How&#39;d I do?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We&#39;ll tell you in a minute.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Well, who was the musician?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Joshua Bell.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;NO!!!&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;A onetime child prodigy, at 39 Joshua Bell has arrived as an <br/>
&gt;internationally<br/>
&gt;acclaimed virtuoso. Three days before he appeared at the Metro station, <br/>
&gt;Bell<br/>
&gt;had filled the house at Boston&#39;s stately Symphony Hall, where merely pretty<br/>
&gt;good seats went for $100. Two weeks later, at the Music Center at<br/>
&gt;Strathmore, in North Bethesda, he would play to a standing-room-only<br/>
&gt;audience so respectful of his artistry that they stifled their coughs until<br/>
&gt;the silence between movements. But on that Friday in January, Joshua Bell<br/>
&gt;was just another mendicant, competing for the attention of busy people on<br/>
&gt;their way to work.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Bell was first pitched this idea shortly before Christmas, over coffee at a<br/>
&gt;sandwich shop on Capitol Hill. A New Yorker, he was in town to perform at<br/>
&gt;the Library of Congress and to visit the library&#39;s vaults to examine an<br/>
&gt;unusual treasure: an 18th-century violin that once belonged to the great<br/>
&gt;Austrian-born virtuoso and composer Fritz Kreisler. The curators invited<br/>
&gt;Bell to play it; good sound, still.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Here&#39;s what I&#39;m thinking,&quot; Bell confided, as he sipped his coffee. &quot;I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;thinking that I could do a tour where I&#39;d play Kreisler&#39;s music . . .&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;He smiled.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;. . . on Kreisler&#39;s violin.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It was a snazzy, sequined idea -- part inspiration and part gimmick -- and<br/>
&gt;it was typical of Bell, who has unapologetically embraced showmanship even<br/>
&gt;as his concert career has become more and more august. He&#39;s soloed with the<br/>
&gt;finest orchestras here and abroad, but he&#39;s also appeared on &quot;Sesame<br/>
&gt;Street,&quot; done late-night talk TV and performed in feature films. That was<br/>
&gt;Bell playing the soundtrack on the 1998 movie &quot;The Red Violin.&quot; (He<br/>
&gt;body-doubled, too, playing to a naked Greta Scacchi.) As composer John<br/>
&gt;Corigliano accepted the Oscar for Best Original Dramatic Score, he credited<br/>
&gt;Bell, who, he said, &quot;plays like a god.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When Bell was asked if he&#39;d be willing to don street clothes and perform at<br/>
&gt;rush hour, he said:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Uh, a stunt?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well, yes. A stunt. Would he think it . . . unseemly?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Bell drained his cup.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Sounds like fun,&quot; he said.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Bell&#39;s a heartthrob. Tall and handsome, he&#39;s got a Donny Osmond-like dose <br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt;the cutes, and, onstage, cute elides into hott. When he performs, he is<br/>
&gt;usually the only man under the lights who is not in white tie and tails --<br/>
&gt;he walks out to a standing O, looking like Zorro, in black pants and an<br/>
&gt;untucked black dress shirt, shirttail dangling. That cute Beatles-style mop<br/>
&gt;top is also a strategic asset: Because his technique is full of body --<br/>
&gt;athletic and passionate -- he&#39;s almost dancing with the instrument, and his<br/>
&gt;hair flies.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;He&#39;s single and straight, a fact not lost on some of his fans. In Boston, <br/>
&gt;as<br/>
&gt;he performed Max Bruch&#39;s dour Violin Concerto in G Minor, the very few <br/>
&gt;young<br/>
&gt;women in the audience nearly disappeared in the deep sea of silver heads.<br/>
&gt;But seemingly every single one of them -- a distillate of the young and<br/>
&gt;pretty -- coalesced at the stage door after the performance, seeking an<br/>
&gt;autograph. It&#39;s like that always, with Bell.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Bell&#39;s been accepting over-the-top accolades since puberty: Interview<br/>
&gt;magazine once said his playing &quot;does nothing less than tell human beings <br/>
&gt;why<br/>
&gt;they bother to live.&quot; He&#39;s learned to field these things graciously, with a<br/>
&gt;bashful duck of the head and a modified &quot;pshaw.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For this incognito performance, Bell had only one condition for<br/>
&gt;participating. The event had been described to him as a test of whether, in<br/>
&gt;an incongruous context, ordinary people would recognize genius. His<br/>
&gt;condition: &quot;I&#39;m not comfortable if you call this genius.&quot; &quot;Genius&quot; is an<br/>
&gt;overused word, he said: It can be applied to some of the composers whose<br/>
&gt;work he plays, but not to him. His skills are largely interpretive, he <br/>
&gt;said,<br/>
&gt;and to imply otherwise would be unseemly and inaccurate.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It was an interesting request, and under the circumstances, one that will <br/>
&gt;be<br/>
&gt;honored. The word will not again appear in this article.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It would be breaking no rules, however, to note that the term in question,<br/>
&gt;particularly as applied in the field of music, refers to a congenital<br/>
&gt;brilliance -- an elite, innate, preternatural ability that manifests itself<br/>
&gt;early, and often in dramatic fashion.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;One biographically intriguing fact about Bell is that he got his first <br/>
&gt;music<br/>
&gt;lessons when he was a 4-year-old in Bloomington, Ind. His parents, both<br/>
&gt;psychologists, decided formal training might be a good idea after they saw<br/>
&gt;that their son had strung rubber bands across his dresser drawers and was<br/>
&gt;replicating classical tunes by ear, moving drawers in and out to vary the<br/>
&gt;pitch.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;TO GET TO THE METRO FROM HIS HOTEL, a distance of three blocks, Bell took a<br/>
&gt;taxi. He&#39;s neither lame nor lazy: He did it for his violin.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Bell always performs on the same instrument, and he ruled out using another<br/>
&gt;for this gig. Called the Gibson ex Huberman, it was handcrafted in 1713 by<br/>
&gt;Antonio Stradivari during the Italian master&#39;s &quot;golden period,&quot; toward the<br/>
&gt;end of his career, when he had access to the finest spruce, maple and<br/>
&gt;willow, and when his technique had been refined to perfection.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Our knowledge of acoustics is still incomplete,&quot; Bell said, &quot;but he, he<br/>
&gt;just . . . knew.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Bell doesn&#39;t mention Stradivari by name. Just &quot;he.&quot; When the violinist <br/>
&gt;shows<br/>
&gt;his Strad to people, he holds the instrument gingerly by its neck, resting<br/>
&gt;it on a knee. &quot;He made this to perfect thickness at all parts,&quot; Bell says,<br/>
&gt;pivoting it. &quot;If you shaved off a millimeter of wood at any point, it would<br/>
&gt;totally imbalance the sound.&quot; No violins sound as wonderful as Strads from<br/>
&gt;the 1710s, still.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The front of Bell&#39;s violin is in nearly perfect condition, with a deep, <br/>
&gt;rich<br/>
&gt;grain and luster. The back is a mess, its dark reddish finish bleeding away<br/>
&gt;into a flatter, lighter shade and finally, in one section, to bare wood.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;This has never been refinished,&quot; Bell said. &quot;That&#39;s his original varnish.<br/>
&gt;People attribute aspects of the sound to the varnish. Each maker had his <br/>
&gt;own<br/>
&gt;secret formula.&quot; Stradivari is thought to have made his from an ingeniously<br/>
&gt;balanced cocktail of honey, egg whites and gum arabic from sub-Saharan<br/>
&gt;trees.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Like the instrument in &quot;The Red Violin,&quot; this one has a past filled with<br/>
&gt;mystery and malice. Twice, it was stolen from its illustrious prior owner,<br/>
&gt;the Polish virtuoso Bronislaw Huberman. The first time, in 1919, it<br/>
&gt;disappeared from Huberman&#39;s hotel room in Vienna but was quickly returned.<br/>
&gt;The second time, nearly 20 years later, it was pinched from his dressing<br/>
&gt;room in Carnegie Hall. He never got it back. It was not until 1985 that the<br/>
&gt;thief -- a minor New York violinist -- made a deathbed confession to his<br/>
&gt;wife, and produced the instrument.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Bell bought it a few years ago. He had to sell his own Strad and borrow <br/>
&gt;much<br/>
&gt;of the rest. The price tag was reported to be about $3.5 million.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;All of which is a long explanation for why, in the early morning chill of a<br/>
&gt;day in January, Josh Bell took a three-block cab ride to the Orange Line,<br/>
&gt;and rode one stop to L&#39;Enfant.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;AS METRO STATIONS GO, L&#39;ENFANT PLAZA IS MORE PLEBEIAN THAN MOST. Even <br/>
&gt;before<br/>
&gt;you arrive, it gets no respect. Metro conductors never seem to get it <br/>
&gt;right:<br/>
&gt;&quot;Leh-fahn.&quot; &quot;Layfont.&quot; &quot;El&#39;phant.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;At the top of the escalators are a shoeshine stand and a busy kiosk that<br/>
&gt;sells newspapers, lottery tickets and a wallfull of magazines with titles<br/>
&gt;such as Mammazons and Girls of Barely Legal. The skin mags move, but it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;that lottery ticket dispenser that stays the busiest, with customers <br/>
&gt;queuing<br/>
&gt;up for Daily 6 lotto and Powerball and the ultimate suckers&#39; bait, those<br/>
&gt;pamphlets that sell random number combinations purporting to be &quot;hot.&quot; They<br/>
&gt;sell briskly. There&#39;s also a quick-check machine to slide in your lotto<br/>
&gt;ticket, post-drawing, to see if you&#39;ve won. Beneath it is a forlorn pile of<br/>
&gt;crumpled slips.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;On Friday, January 12, the people waiting in the lottery line looking for a<br/>
&gt;long shot would get a lucky break -- a free, close-up ticket to a concert <br/>
&gt;by<br/>
&gt;one of the world&#39;s most famous musicians -- but only if they were of a mind<br/>
&gt;to take note.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Bell decided to begin with &quot;Chaconne&quot; from Johann Sebastian Bach&#39;s Partita<br/>
&gt;No. 2 in D Minor. Bell calls it &quot;not just one of the greatest pieces of<br/>
&gt;music ever written, but one of the greatest achievements of any man in<br/>
&gt;history. It&#39;s a spiritually powerful piece, emotionally powerful,<br/>
&gt;structurally perfect. Plus, it was written for a solo violin, so I won&#39;t be<br/>
&gt;cheating with some half-assed version.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Bell didn&#39;t say it, but Bach&#39;s &quot;Chaconne&quot; is also considered one of the <br/>
&gt;most<br/>
&gt;difficult violin pieces to master. Many try; few succeed. It&#39;s exhaustingly<br/>
&gt;long -- 14 minutes -- and consists entirely of a single, succinct musical<br/>
&gt;progression repeated in dozens of variations to create a dauntingly complex<br/>
&gt;architecture of sound. Composed around 1720, on the eve of the European<br/>
&gt;Enlightenment, it is said to be a celebration of the breadth of human<br/>
&gt;possibility.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If Bell&#39;s encomium to &quot;Chaconne&quot; seems overly effusive, consider this from<br/>
&gt;the 19th-century composer Johannes Brahms, in a letter to Clara Schumann:<br/>
&gt;&quot;On one stave, for a small instrument, the man writes a whole world of the<br/>
&gt;deepest thoughts and most powerful feelings. If I imagined that I could <br/>
&gt;have<br/>
&gt;created, even conceived the piece, I am quite certain that the excess of<br/>
&gt;excitement and earth-shattering experience would have driven me out of my<br/>
&gt;mind.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So, that&#39;s the piece Bell started with.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;He&#39;d clearly meant it when he promised not to cheap out this performance: <br/>
&gt;He<br/>
&gt;played with acrobatic enthusiasm, his body leaning into the music and<br/>
&gt;arching on tiptoes at the high notes. The sound was nearly symphonic,<br/>
&gt;carrying to all parts of the homely arcade as the pedestrian traffic filed<br/>
&gt;past.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Three minutes went by before something happened. Sixty-three people had<br/>
&gt;already passed when, finally, there was a breakthrough of sorts. A<br/>
&gt;middle-age man altered his gait for a split second, turning his head to<br/>
&gt;notice that there seemed to be some guy playing music. Yes, the man kept<br/>
&gt;walking, but it was something.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;A half-minute later, Bell got his first donation. A woman threw in a buck<br/>
&gt;and scooted off. It was not until six minutes into the performance that<br/>
&gt;someone actually stood against a wall, and listened.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Things never got much better. In the three-quarters of an hour that Joshua<br/>
&gt;Bell played, seven people stopped what they were doing to hang around and<br/>
&gt;take in the performance, at least for a minute. Twenty-seven gave money,<br/>
&gt;most of them on the run -- for a total of $32 and change. That leaves the<br/>
&gt;1,070 people who hurried by, oblivious, many only three feet away, few even<br/>
&gt;turning to look.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;No, Mr. Slatkin, there was never a crowd, not even for a second.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It was all videotaped by a hidden camera. You can play the recording once <br/>
&gt;or<br/>
&gt;15 times, and it never gets any easier to watch. Try speeding it up, and it<br/>
&gt;becomes one of those herky-jerky World War I-era silent newsreels. The<br/>
&gt;people scurry by in comical little hops and starts, cups of coffee in their<br/>
&gt;hands, cellphones at their ears, ID tags slapping at their bellies, a grim<br/>
&gt;danse macabre to indifference, inertia and the dingy, gray rush of<br/>
&gt;modernity.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Even at this accelerated pace, though, the fiddler&#39;s movements remain fluid<br/>
&gt;and graceful; he seems so apart from his audience -- unseen, unheard,<br/>
&gt;otherworldly -- that you find yourself thinking that he&#39;s not really there.<br/>
&gt;A ghost.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Only then do you see it: He is the one who is real. They are the ghosts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;IF A GREAT MUSICIAN PLAYS GREAT MUSIC BUT NO ONE HEARS . . . WAS HE REALLY<br/>
&gt;ANY GOOD?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s an old epistemological debate, older, actually, than the koan about <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;tree in the forest. Plato weighed in on it, and philosophers for two<br/>
&gt;millennia afterward: What is beauty? Is it a measurable fact (Gottfried<br/>
&gt;Leibniz), or merely an opinion (David Hume), or is it a little of each,<br/>
&gt;colored by the immediate state of mind of the observer (Immanuel Kant)?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We&#39;ll go with Kant, because he&#39;s obviously right, and because he brings us<br/>
&gt;pretty directly to Joshua Bell, sitting there in a hotel restaurant, <br/>
&gt;picking<br/>
&gt;at his breakfast, wryly trying to figure out what the hell had just <br/>
&gt;happened<br/>
&gt;back there at the Metro.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;At the beginning,&quot; Bell says, &quot;I was just concentrating on playing the<br/>
&gt;music. I wasn&#39;t really watching what was happening around me . . .&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Playing the violin looks all-consuming, mentally and physically, but Bell<br/>
&gt;says that for him the mechanics of it are partly second nature, cemented by<br/>
&gt;practice and muscle memory: It&#39;s like a juggler, he says, who can keep <br/>
&gt;those<br/>
&gt;balls in play while interacting with a crowd. What he&#39;s mostly thinking<br/>
&gt;about as he plays, Bell says, is capturing emotion as a narrative: &quot;When <br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt;play a violin piece, you are a storyteller, and you&#39;re telling a story.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;With &quot;Chaconne,&quot; the opening is filled with a building sense of awe. That<br/>
&gt;kept him busy for a while. Eventually, though, he began to steal a sidelong<br/>
&gt;glance.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;It was a strange feeling, that people were actually, ah . . .&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The word doesn&#39;t come easily.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;. . . ignoring me.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Bell is laughing. It&#39;s at himself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;At a music hall, I&#39;ll get upset if someone coughs or if someone&#39;s <br/>
&gt;cellphone<br/>
&gt;goes off. But here, my expectations quickly diminished. I started to<br/>
&gt;appreciate any acknowledgment, even a slight glance up. I was oddly <br/>
&gt;grateful<br/>
&gt;when someone threw in a dollar instead of change.&quot; This is from a man whose<br/>
&gt;talents can command $1,000 a minute.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Before he began, Bell hadn&#39;t known what to expect. What he does know is<br/>
&gt;that, for some reason, he was nervous.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;It wasn&#39;t exactly stage fright, but there were butterflies,&quot; he says. &quot;I<br/>
&gt;was stressing a little.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Bell has played, literally, before crowned heads of Europe. Why the anxiety<br/>
&gt;at the Washington Metro?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;When you play for ticket-holders,&quot; Bell explains, &quot;you are already<br/>
&gt;validated. I have no sense that I need to be accepted. I&#39;m already <br/>
&gt;accepted.<br/>
&gt;Here, there was this thought: What if they don&#39;t like me? What if they<br/>
&gt;resent my presence . . .&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;He was, in short, art without a frame. Which, it turns out, may have a lot<br/>
&gt;to do with what happened -- or, more precisely, what didn&#39;t happen -- on<br/>
&gt;January 12.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;MARK LEITHAUSER HAS HELD IN HIS HANDS MORE GREAT WORKS OF ART THAN ANY KING<br/>
&gt;OR POPE OR MEDICI EVER DID. A senior curator at the National Gallery, he<br/>
&gt;oversees the framing of the paintings. Leithauser thinks he has some idea <br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt;what happened at that Metro station.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Let&#39;s say I took one of our more abstract masterpieces, say an Ellsworth<br/>
&gt;Kelly, and removed it from its frame, marched it down the 52 steps that<br/>
&gt;people walk up to get to the National Gallery, past the giant columns, and<br/>
&gt;brought it into a restaurant. It&#39;s a $5 million painting. And it&#39;s one of<br/>
&gt;those restaurants where there are pieces of original art for sale, by some<br/>
&gt;industrious kids from the Corcoran School, and I hang that Kelly on the <br/>
&gt;wall<br/>
&gt;with a price tag of $150. No one is going to notice it. An art curator <br/>
&gt;might<br/>
&gt;look up and say: &#39;Hey, that looks a little like an Ellsworth Kelly. Please<br/>
&gt;pass the salt.&#39;&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Leithauser&#39;s point is that we shouldn&#39;t be too ready to label the Metro<br/>
&gt;passersby unsophisticated boobs. Context matters.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Kant said the same thing. He took beauty seriously: In his Critique of<br/>
&gt;Aesthetic Judgment, Kant argued that one&#39;s ability to appreciate beauty is<br/>
&gt;related to one&#39;s ability to make moral judgments. But there was a caveat.<br/>
&gt;Paul Guyer of the University of Pennsylvania, one of America&#39;s most<br/>
&gt;prominent Kantian scholars, says the 18th-century German philosopher felt<br/>
&gt;that to properly appreciate beauty, the viewing conditions must be optimal.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Optimal,&quot; Guyer said, &quot;doesn&#39;t mean heading to work, focusing on your<br/>
&gt;report to the boss, maybe your shoes don&#39;t fit right.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So, if Kant had been at the Metro watching as Joshua Bell play to a <br/>
&gt;thousand<br/>
&gt;unimpressed passersby?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;He would have inferred about them,&quot; Guyer said, &quot;absolutely nothing.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And that&#39;s that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Except it isn&#39;t. To really understand what happened, you have to rewind <br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt;video and play it back from the beginning, from the moment Bell&#39;s bow first<br/>
&gt;touched the strings.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;White guy, khakis, leather jacket, briefcase. Early 30s. John David<br/>
&gt;Mortensen is on the final leg of his daily bus-to-Metro commute from <br/>
&gt;Reston.<br/>
&gt;He&#39;s heading up the escalator. It&#39;s a long ride -- 1 minute and 15 seconds<br/>
&gt;if you don&#39;t walk. So, like most everyone who passes Bell this day,<br/>
&gt;Mortensen gets a good earful of music before he has his first look at the<br/>
&gt;musician. Like most of them, he notes that it sounds pretty good. But like<br/>
&gt;very few of them, when he gets to the top, he doesn&#39;t race past as though<br/>
&gt;Bell were some nuisance to be avoided. Mortensen is that first person to<br/>
&gt;stop, that guy at the six-minute mark.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s not that he has nothing else to do. He&#39;s a project manager for an<br/>
&gt;international program at the Department of Energy; on this day, Mortensen<br/>
&gt;has to participate in a monthly budget exercise, not the most exciting part<br/>
&gt;of his job: &quot;You review the past month&#39;s expenditures,&quot; he says, &quot;forecast<br/>
&gt;spending for the next month, if you have X dollars, where will it go, that<br/>
&gt;sort of thing.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;On the video, you can see Mortensen get off the escalator and look around.<br/>
&gt;He locates the violinist, stops, walks away but then is drawn back. He<br/>
&gt;checks the time on his cellphone -- he&#39;s three minutes early for work --<br/>
&gt;then settles against a wall to listen.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Mortensen doesn&#39;t know classical music at all; classic rock is as close as<br/>
&gt;he comes. But there&#39;s something about what he&#39;s hearing that he really<br/>
&gt;likes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As it happens, he&#39;s arrived at the moment that Bell slides into the second<br/>
&gt;section of &quot;Chaconne.&quot; (&quot;It&#39;s the point,&quot; Bell says, &quot;where it moves from a<br/>
&gt;darker, minor key into a major key. There&#39;s a religious, exalted feeling to<br/>
&gt;it.&quot;) The violinist&#39;s bow begins to dance; the music becomes upbeat,<br/>
&gt;playful, theatrical, big.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Mortensen doesn&#39;t know about major or minor keys: &quot;Whatever it was,&quot; he<br/>
&gt;says, &quot;it made me feel at peace.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So, for the first time in his life, Mortensen lingers to listen to a street<br/>
&gt;musician. He stays his allotted three minutes as 94 more people pass <br/>
&gt;briskly<br/>
&gt;by. When he leaves to help plan contingency budgets for the Department of<br/>
&gt;Energy, there&#39;s another first. For the first time in his life, not quite<br/>
&gt;knowing what had just happened but sensing it was special, John David<br/>
&gt;Mortensen gives a street musician money.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;THERE ARE SIX MOMENTS IN THE VIDEO THAT BELL FINDS PARTICULARLY PAINFUL TO<br/>
&gt;RELIVE: &quot;The awkward times,&quot; he calls them. It&#39;s what happens right after<br/>
&gt;each piece ends: nothing. The music stops. The same people who hadn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;noticed him playing don&#39;t notice that he has finished. No applause, no<br/>
&gt;acknowledgment. So Bell just saws out a small, nervous chord -- the<br/>
&gt;embarrassed musician&#39;s equivalent of, &quot;Er, okay, moving right along . . .&quot;<br/>
&gt;-- and begins the next piece.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;After &quot;Chaconne,&quot; it is Franz Schubert&#39;s &quot;Ave Maria,&quot; which surprised some<br/>
&gt;music critics when it debuted in 1825: Schubert seldom showed religious<br/>
&gt;feeling in his compositions, yet &quot;Ave Maria&quot; is a breathtaking work of<br/>
&gt;adoration of the Virgin Mary. What was with the sudden piety? Schubert <br/>
&gt;dryly<br/>
&gt;answered: &quot;I think this is due to the fact that I never forced devotion in<br/>
&gt;myself and never compose hymns or prayers of that kind unless it overcomes<br/>
&gt;me unawares; but then it is usually the right and true devotion.&quot; This<br/>
&gt;musical prayer became among the most familiar and enduring religious pieces<br/>
&gt;in history.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;A couple of minutes into it, something revealing happens. A woman and her<br/>
&gt;preschooler emerge from the escalator. The woman is walking briskly and,<br/>
&gt;therefore, so is the child. She&#39;s got his hand.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;I had a time crunch,&quot; recalls Sheron Parker, an IT director for a federal<br/>
&gt;agency. &quot;I had an 8:30 training class, and first I had to rush Evvie off to<br/>
&gt;his teacher, then rush back to work, then to the training facility in the<br/>
&gt;basement.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Evvie is her son, Evan. Evan is 3.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You can see Evan clearly on the video. He&#39;s the cute black kid in the parka<br/>
&gt;who keeps twisting around to look at Joshua Bell, as he is being propelled<br/>
&gt;toward the door.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;There was a musician,&quot; Parker says, &quot;and my son was intrigued. He wanted <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;pull over and listen, but I was rushed for time.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So Parker does what she has to do. She deftly moves her body between Evan&#39;s<br/>
&gt;and Bell&#39;s, cutting off her son&#39;s line of sight. As they exit the arcade,<br/>
&gt;Evan can still be seen craning to look. When Parker is told what she walked<br/>
&gt;out on, she laughs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Evan is very smart!&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The poet Billy Collins once laughingly observed that all babies are born<br/>
&gt;with a knowledge of poetry, because the lub-dub of the mother&#39;s heart is in<br/>
&gt;iambic meter. Then, Collins said, life slowly starts to choke the poetry <br/>
&gt;out<br/>
&gt;of us. It may be true with music, too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There was no ethnic or demographic pattern to distinguish the people who<br/>
&gt;stayed to watch Bell, or the ones who gave money, from that vast majority<br/>
&gt;who hurried on past, unheeding. Whites, blacks and Asians, young and old,<br/>
&gt;men and women, were represented in all three groups. But the behavior of <br/>
&gt;one<br/>
&gt;demographic remained absolutely consistent. Every single time a child <br/>
&gt;walked<br/>
&gt;past, he or she tried to stop and watch. And every single time, a parent<br/>
&gt;scooted the kid away.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;IF THERE WAS ONE PERSON ON THAT DAY WHO WAS TOO BUSY TO PAY ATTENTION TO <br/>
&gt;THE<br/>
&gt;VIOLINIST, it was George Tindley. Tindley wasn&#39;t hurrying to get to work. <br/>
&gt;He<br/>
&gt;was at work.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The glass doors through which most people exit the L&#39;Enfant station lead<br/>
&gt;into an indoor shopping mall, from which there are exits to the street and<br/>
&gt;elevators to office buildings. The first store in the mall is an Au Bon<br/>
&gt;Pain, the croissant and coffee shop where Tindley, in his 40s, works in a<br/>
&gt;white uniform busing the tables, restocking the salt and pepper packets,<br/>
&gt;taking out the garbage. Tindley labors under the watchful eye of his <br/>
&gt;bosses,<br/>
&gt;and he&#39;s supposed to be hopping, and he was.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But every minute or so, as though drawn by something not entirely within <br/>
&gt;his<br/>
&gt;control, Tindley would walk to the very edge of the Au Bon Pain property,<br/>
&gt;keeping his toes inside the line, still on the job. Then he&#39;d lean forward,<br/>
&gt;as far out into the hallway as he could, watching the fiddler on the other<br/>
&gt;side of the glass doors. The foot traffic was steady, so the doors were<br/>
&gt;usually open. The sound came through pretty well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;You could tell in one second that this guy was good, that he was clearly a<br/>
&gt;professional,&quot; Tindley says. He plays the guitar, loves the sound of<br/>
&gt;strings, and has no respect for a certain kind of musician.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Most people, they play music; they don&#39;t feel it,&quot; Tindley says. &quot;Well,<br/>
&gt;that man was feeling it. That man was moving. Moving into the sound.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;A hundred feet away, across the arcade, was the lottery line, sometimes <br/>
&gt;five<br/>
&gt;or six people long. They had a much better view of Bell than Tindley did, <br/>
&gt;if<br/>
&gt;they had just turned around. But no one did. Not in the entire 43 minutes.<br/>
&gt;They just shuffled forward toward that machine spitting out numbers. Eyes <br/>
&gt;on<br/>
&gt;the prize.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;J.T. Tillman was in that line. A computer specialist for the Department of<br/>
&gt;Housing and Urban Development, he remembers every single number he played<br/>
&gt;that day -- 10 of them, $2 apiece, for a total of $20. He doesn&#39;t recall<br/>
&gt;what the violinist was playing, though. He says it sounded like generic<br/>
&gt;classical music, the kind the ship&#39;s band was playing in &quot;Titanic,&quot; before<br/>
&gt;the iceberg.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;I didn&#39;t think nothing of it,&quot; Tillman says, &quot;just a guy trying to make a<br/>
&gt;couple of bucks.&quot; Tillman would have given him one or two, he said, but he<br/>
&gt;spent all his cash on lotto.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When he is told that he stiffed one of the best musicians in the world, he<br/>
&gt;laughs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Is he ever going to play around here again?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Yeah, but you&#39;re going to have to pay a lot to hear him.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Damn.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Tillman didn&#39;t win the lottery, either.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;BELL ENDS &quot;AVE MARIA&quot; TO ANOTHER THUNDEROUS SILENCE, plays Manuel Ponce&#39;s<br/>
&gt;sentimental &quot;Estrellita,&quot; then a piece by Jules Massenet, and then begins a<br/>
&gt;Bach gavotte, a joyful, frolicsome, lyrical dance. It&#39;s got an Old World<br/>
&gt;delicacy to it; you can imagine it entertaining bewigged dancers at a<br/>
&gt;Versailles ball, or -- in a lute, fiddle and fife version -- the<br/>
&gt;boot-kicking peasants of a Pieter Bruegel painting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Watching the video weeks later, Bell finds himself mystified by one thing<br/>
&gt;only. He understands why he&#39;s not drawing a crowd, in the rush of a morning<br/>
&gt;workday. But: &quot;I&#39;m surprised at the number of people who don&#39;t pay <br/>
&gt;attention<br/>
&gt;at all, as if I&#39;m invisible. Because, you know what? I&#39;m makin&#39; a lot of<br/>
&gt;noise!&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;He is. You don&#39;t need to know music at all to appreciate the simple fact<br/>
&gt;that there&#39;s a guy there, playing a violin that&#39;s throwing out a whole<br/>
&gt;bucket of sound; at times, Bell&#39;s bowing is so intricate that you seem to <br/>
&gt;be<br/>
&gt;hearing two instruments playing in harmony. So those head-forward,<br/>
&gt;quick-stepping passersby are a remarkable phenomenon.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Bell wonders whether their inattention may be deliberate: If you don&#39;t take<br/>
&gt;visible note of the musician, you don&#39;t have to feel guilty about not<br/>
&gt;forking over money; you&#39;re not complicit in a rip-off.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It may be true, but no one gave that explanation. People just said they <br/>
&gt;were<br/>
&gt;busy, had other things on their mind. Some who were on cellphones spoke<br/>
&gt;louder as they passed Bell, to compete with that infernal racket.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And then there was Calvin Myint. Myint works for the General Services<br/>
&gt;Administration. He got to the top of the escalator, turned right and headed<br/>
&gt;out a door to the street. A few hours later, he had no memory that there <br/>
&gt;had<br/>
&gt;been a musician anywhere in sight.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Where was he, in relation to me?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;About four feet away.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Oh.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There&#39;s nothing wrong with Myint&#39;s hearing. He had buds in his ear. He was<br/>
&gt;listening to his iPod.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For many of us, the explosion in technology has perversely limited, not<br/>
&gt;expanded, our exposure to new experiences. Increasingly, we get our news<br/>
&gt;from sources that think as we already do. And with iPods, we hear what we<br/>
&gt;already know; we program our own playlists.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The song that Calvin Myint was listening to was &quot;Just Like Heaven,&quot; by the<br/>
&gt;British rock band The Cure. It&#39;s a terrific song, actually. The meaning is <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;little opaque, and the Web is filled with earnest efforts to deconstruct <br/>
&gt;it.<br/>
&gt;Many are far-fetched, but some are right on point: It&#39;s about a tragic<br/>
&gt;emotional disconnect. A man has found the woman of his dreams but can&#39;t<br/>
&gt;express the depth of his feeling for her until she&#39;s gone. It&#39;s about<br/>
&gt;failing to see the beauty of what&#39;s plainly in front of your eyes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;YES, I SAW THE VIOLINIST,&quot; Jackie Hessian says, &quot;but nothing about him<br/>
&gt;struck me as much of anything.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You couldn&#39;t tell that by watching her. Hessian was one of those people who<br/>
&gt;gave Bell a long, hard look before walking on. It turns out that she wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;noticing the music at all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;I really didn&#39;t hear that much,&quot; she said. &quot;I was just trying to figure <br/>
&gt;out<br/>
&gt;what he was doing there, how does this work for him, can he make much <br/>
&gt;money,<br/>
&gt;would it be better to start with some money in the case, or for it to be<br/>
&gt;empty, so people feel sorry for you? I was analyzing it financially.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What do you do, Jackie?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;I&#39;m a lawyer in labor relations with the United States Postal Service. I<br/>
&gt;just negotiated a national contract.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;THE BEST SEATS IN THE HOUSE WERE UPHOLSTERED. In the balcony, more or less.<br/>
&gt;On that day, for $5, you&#39;d get a lot more than just a nice shine on your<br/>
&gt;shoes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Only one person occupied one of those seats when Bell played. Terence <br/>
&gt;Holmes<br/>
&gt;is a consultant for the Department of Transportation, and he liked the <br/>
&gt;music<br/>
&gt;just fine, but it was really about a shoeshine: &quot;My father told me never to<br/>
&gt;wear a suit with your shoes not cleaned and shined.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Holmes wears suits often, so he is up in that perch a lot, and he&#39;s got a<br/>
&gt;good relationship with the shoeshine lady. Holmes is a good tipper and a<br/>
&gt;good talker, which is a skill that came in handy that day. The shoeshine<br/>
&gt;lady was upset about something, and the music got her more upset. She<br/>
&gt;complained, Holmes said, that the music was too loud, and he tried to calm<br/>
&gt;her down.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Edna Souza is from Brazil. She&#39;s been shining shoes at L&#39;Enfant Plaza for<br/>
&gt;six years, and she&#39;s had her fill of street musicians there; when they <br/>
&gt;play,<br/>
&gt;she can&#39;t hear her customers, and that&#39;s bad for business. So she fights.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Souza points to the dividing line between the Metro property, at the top of<br/>
&gt;the escalator, and the arcade, which is under control of the management<br/>
&gt;company that runs the mall. Sometimes, Souza says, a musician will stand on<br/>
&gt;the Metro side, sometimes on the mall side. Either way, she&#39;s got him. On<br/>
&gt;her speed dial, she has phone numbers for both the mall cops and the Metro<br/>
&gt;cops. The musicians seldom last long.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What about Joshua Bell?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;He was too loud, too, Souza says. Then she looks down at her rag, sniffs.<br/>
&gt;She hates to say anything positive about these damned musicians, but: &quot;He<br/>
&gt;was pretty good, that guy. It was the first time I didn&#39;t call the police.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Souza was surprised to learn he was a famous musician, but not that people<br/>
&gt;rushed blindly by him. That, she said, was predictable. &quot;If something like<br/>
&gt;this happened in Brazil, everyone would stand around to see. Not here.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Souza nods sourly toward a spot near the top of the escalator: &quot;Couple of<br/>
&gt;years ago, a homeless guy died right there. He just lay down there and <br/>
&gt;died.<br/>
&gt;The police came, an ambulance came, and no one even stopped to see or <br/>
&gt;slowed<br/>
&gt;down to look.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;People walk up the escalator, they look straight ahead. Mind your own<br/>
&gt;business, eyes forward. Everyone is stressed. Do you know what I mean?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What is this life if, full of care,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We have no time to stand and stare.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;-- from &quot;Leisure,&quot; by W.H. Davies<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Let&#39;s say Kant is right. Let&#39;s accept that we can&#39;t look at what happened <br/>
&gt;on<br/>
&gt;January 12 and make any judgment whatever about people&#39;s sophistication or<br/>
&gt;their ability to appreciate beauty. But what about their ability to<br/>
&gt;appreciate life?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We&#39;re busy. Americans have been busy, as a people, since at least 1831, <br/>
&gt;when<br/>
&gt;a young French sociologist named Alexis de Tocqueville visited the States<br/>
&gt;and found himself impressed, bemused and slightly dismayed at the degree to<br/>
&gt;which people were driven, to the exclusion of everything else, by hard work<br/>
&gt;and the accumulation of wealth.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Not much has changed. Pop in a DVD of &quot;Koyaanisqatsi,&quot; the wordless, darkly<br/>
&gt;brilliant, avant-garde 1982 film about the frenetic speed of modern life.<br/>
&gt;Backed by the minimalist music of Philip Glass, director Godfrey Reggio<br/>
&gt;takes film clips of Americans going about their daily business, but speeds<br/>
&gt;them up until they resemble assembly-line machines, robots marching <br/>
&gt;lockstep<br/>
&gt;to nowhere. Now look at the video from L&#39;Enfant Plaza, in fast-forward. The<br/>
&gt;Philip Glass soundtrack fits it perfectly.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Koyaanisqatsi&quot; is a Hopi word. It means &quot;life out of balance.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In his 2003 book, Timeless Beauty: In the Arts and Everyday Life, British<br/>
&gt;author John Lane writes about the loss of the appreciation for beauty in <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;modern world. The experiment at L&#39;Enfant Plaza may be symptomatic of that,<br/>
&gt;he said -- not because people didn&#39;t have the capacity to understand <br/>
&gt;beauty,<br/>
&gt;but because it was irrelevant to them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;This is about having the wrong priorities,&quot; Lane said.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If we can&#39;t take the time out of our lives to stay a moment and listen to<br/>
&gt;one of the best musicians on Earth play some of the best music ever <br/>
&gt;written;<br/>
&gt;if the surge of modern life so overpowers us that we are deaf and blind to<br/>
&gt;something like that -- then what else are we missing?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That&#39;s what the Welsh poet W.H. Davies meant in 1911 when he published <br/>
&gt;those<br/>
&gt;two lines that begin this section. They made him famous. The thought was<br/>
&gt;simple, even primitive, but somehow no one had put it quite that way <br/>
&gt;before.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Of course, Davies had an advantage -- an advantage of perception. He wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;a tradesman or a laborer or a bureaucrat or a consultant or a policy <br/>
&gt;analyst<br/>
&gt;or a labor lawyer or a program manager. He was a hobo.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;THE CULTURAL HERO OF THE DAY ARRIVED AT L&#39;ENFANT PLAZA PRETTY LATE, in the<br/>
&gt;unprepossessing figure of one John Picarello, a smallish man with a baldish<br/>
&gt;head.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Picarello hit the top of the escalator just after Bell began his final<br/>
&gt;piece, a reprise of &quot;Chaconne.&quot; In the video, you see Picarello stop dead <br/>
&gt;in<br/>
&gt;his tracks, locate the source of the music, and then retreat to the other<br/>
&gt;end of the arcade. He takes up a position past the shoeshine stand, across<br/>
&gt;from that lottery line, and he will not budge for the next nine minutes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Like all the passersby interviewed for this article, Picarello was stopped<br/>
&gt;by a reporter after he left the building, and was asked for his phone<br/>
&gt;number. Like everyone, he was told only that this was to be an article <br/>
&gt;about<br/>
&gt;commuting. When he was called later in the day, like everyone else, he was<br/>
&gt;first asked if anything unusual had happened to him on his trip into work.<br/>
&gt;Of the more than 40 people contacted, Picarello was the only one who<br/>
&gt;immediately mentioned the violinist.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;There was a musician playing at the top of the escalator at L&#39;Enfant<br/>
&gt;Plaza.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Haven&#39;t you seen musicians there before?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Not like this one.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What do you mean?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;This was a superb violinist. I&#39;ve never heard anyone of that caliber. He<br/>
&gt;was technically proficient, with very good phrasing. He had a good fiddle,<br/>
&gt;too, with a big, lush sound. I walked a distance away, to hear him. I <br/>
&gt;didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;want to be intrusive on his space.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Really?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Really. It was that kind of experience. It was a treat, just a brilliant,<br/>
&gt;incredible way to start the day.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Picarello knows classical music. He is a fan of Joshua Bell but didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;recognize him; he hadn&#39;t seen a recent photo, and besides, for most of the<br/>
&gt;time Picarello was pretty far away. But he knew this was not a<br/>
&gt;run-of-the-mill guy out there, performing. On the video, you can see<br/>
&gt;Picarello look around him now and then, almost bewildered.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Yeah, other people just were not getting it. It just wasn&#39;t registering.<br/>
&gt;That was baffling to me.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When Picarello was growing up in New York, he studied violin seriously,<br/>
&gt;intending to be a concert musician. But he gave it up at 18, when he <br/>
&gt;decided<br/>
&gt;he&#39;d never be good enough to make it pay. Life does that to you sometimes.<br/>
&gt;Sometimes, you have to do the prudent thing. So he went into another line <br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt;work. He&#39;s a supervisor at the U.S. Postal Service. Doesn&#39;t play the violin<br/>
&gt;much, anymore.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When he left, Picarello says, &quot;I humbly threw in $5.&quot; It was humble: You <br/>
&gt;can<br/>
&gt;actually see that on the video. Picarello walks up, barely looking at Bell,<br/>
&gt;and tosses in the money. Then, as if embarrassed, he quickly walks away <br/>
&gt;from<br/>
&gt;the man he once wanted to be.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Does he have regrets about how things worked out?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The postal supervisor considers this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;No. If you love something but choose not to do it professionally, it&#39;s not<br/>
&gt;a waste. Because, you know, you still have it. You have it forever.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;BELL THINKS HE DID HIS BEST WORK OF THE DAY IN THOSE FINAL FEW MINUTES, in<br/>
&gt;the second &quot;Chaconne.&quot; And that also was the first time more than one <br/>
&gt;person<br/>
&gt;at a time was listening. As Picarello stood in the back, Janice Olu arrived<br/>
&gt;and took up a position a few feet away from Bell. Olu, a public trust<br/>
&gt;officer with HUD, also played the violin as a kid. She didn&#39;t know the name<br/>
&gt;of the piece she was hearing, but she knew the man playing it has a gift.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Olu was on a coffee break and stayed as long as she dared. As she turned to<br/>
&gt;go, she whispered to the stranger next to her, &quot;I really don&#39;t want to<br/>
&gt;leave.&quot; The stranger standing next to her happened to be working for The<br/>
&gt;Washington Post.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In preparing for this event, editors at The Post Magazine discussed how to<br/>
&gt;deal with likely outcomes. The most widely held assumption was that there<br/>
&gt;could well be a problem with crowd control: In a demographic as<br/>
&gt;sophisticated as Washington, the thinking went, several people would surely<br/>
&gt;recognize Bell. Nervous &quot;what-if&quot; scenarios abounded. As people gathered,<br/>
&gt;what if others stopped just to see what the attraction was? Word would<br/>
&gt;spread through the crowd. Cameras would flash. More people flock to the<br/>
&gt;scene; rush-hour pedestrian traffic backs up; tempers flare; the National<br/>
&gt;Guard is called; tear gas, rubber bullets, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As it happens, exactly one person recognized Bell, and she didn&#39;t arrive<br/>
&gt;until near the very end. For Stacy Furukawa, a demographer at the Commerce<br/>
&gt;Department, there was no doubt. She doesn&#39;t know much about classical <br/>
&gt;music,<br/>
&gt;but she had been in the audience three weeks earlier, at Bell&#39;s free <br/>
&gt;concert<br/>
&gt;at the Library of Congress. And here he was, the international virtuoso,<br/>
&gt;sawing away, begging for money. She had no idea what the heck was going on,<br/>
&gt;but whatever it was, she wasn&#39;t about to miss it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Furukawa positioned herself 10 feet away from Bell, front row, center. She<br/>
&gt;had a huge grin on her face. The grin, and Furukawa, remained planted in<br/>
&gt;that spot until the end.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;It was the most astonishing thing I&#39;ve ever seen in Washington,&quot; Furukawa<br/>
&gt;says. &quot;Joshua Bell was standing there playing at rush hour, and people were<br/>
&gt;not stopping, and not even looking, and some were flipping quarters at him!<br/>
&gt;Quarters! I wouldn&#39;t do that to anybody. I was thinking, Omigosh, what kind<br/>
&gt;of a city do I live in that this could happen?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When it was over, Furukawa introduced herself to Bell, and tossed in a<br/>
&gt;twenty. Not counting that -- it was tainted by recognition -- the final <br/>
&gt;haul<br/>
&gt;for his 43 minutes of playing was $32.17. Yes, some people gave pennies.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Actually,&quot; Bell said with a laugh, &quot;that&#39;s not so bad, considering. That&#39;s<br/>
&gt;40 bucks an hour. I could make an okay living doing this, and I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;have to pay an agent.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;These days, at L&#39;Enfant Plaza, lotto ticket sales remain brisk. Musicians<br/>
&gt;still show up from time to time, and they still tick off Edna Souza. Joshua<br/>
&gt;Bell&#39;s latest album, &quot;The Voice of the Violin,&quot; has received the usual<br/>
&gt;critical acclaim. (&quot;Delicate urgency.&quot; &quot;Masterful intimacy.&quot; &quot;Unfailingly<br/>
&gt;exquisite.&quot; &quot;A musical summit.&quot; &quot;. . . will make your heart thump and weep<br/>
&gt;at the same time.&quot;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Bell headed off on a concert tour of European capitals. But he is back in<br/>
&gt;the States this week. He has to be. On Tuesday, he will be accepting the<br/>
&gt;Avery Fisher prize, recognizing the Flop of L&#39;Enfant Plaza as the best<br/>
&gt;classical musician in America.<br/>

&gt; &gt;HE EMERGED FROM THE METRO AT THE L&#39;ENFANT PLAZA STATION AND <br/>
 </span></blockquote>POSITIONED<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;HIMSELF AGAINST A WALL BESIDE A TRASH BASKET. By most measures, he <br/>
 </span></blockquote>was<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;nondescript: a youngish white man in jeans, a long-sleeved T-shirt <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;Washington Nationals baseball cap. From a small case, he removed a <br/>

 </span></blockquote>dollars and<br/>

 </span></blockquote>traffic, and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;began to play.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;It was 7:51 a.m. on Friday, January 12, the middle of the morning <br/>
 </span></blockquote>rush <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;hour.<br/>
&gt; &gt;In the next 43 minutes, as the violinist performed six classical <br/>
 </span></blockquote>pieces,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;1,097 people passed by. Almost all of them were on the way to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>work, which<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;meant, for almost all of them, a government job. L&#39;Enfant Plaza is <br/>
 </span></blockquote>at the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;nucleus of federal Washington, and these were mostly mid-level <br/>
 </span></blockquote>bureaucrats<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;with those indeterminate, oddly fungible titles: policy analyst, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>project<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;manager, budget officer, specialist, facilitator, consultant.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Each passerby had a quick choice to make, one familiar to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>commuters in any<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;urban area where the occasional street performer is part of the <br/>

 </span></blockquote>of the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;moment?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;On that Friday in January, those private questions would be <br/>
 </span></blockquote>answered in an<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;unusually public way. No one knew it, but the fiddler standing <br/>
 </span></blockquote>against a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;bare wall outside the Metro in an indoor arcade at the top of the <br/>
&gt; &gt;escalators<br/>
&gt; &gt;was one of the finest classical musicians in the world, playing <br/>
 </span></blockquote>some of the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;most elegant music ever written on one of the most valuable <br/>
 </span></blockquote>violins ever<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;made. His performance was arranged by The Washington Post as an <br/>
 </span></blockquote>experiment<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;in context, perception and priorities -- as well as an unblinking <br/>
&gt; &gt;assessment<br/>
&gt; &gt;of public taste: In a banal setting at an inconvenient time, would <br/>
 </span></blockquote>beauty<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;transcend?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;The musician did not play popular tunes whose familiarity alone <br/>
 </span></blockquote>might have<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;drawn interest. That was not the test. These were masterpieces <br/>
 </span></blockquote>that have<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;endured for centuries on their brilliance alone, soaring music <br/>
 </span></blockquote>befitting <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt;grandeur of cathedrals and concert halls.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;The acoustics proved surprisingly kind. Though the arcade is of <br/>
 </span></blockquote>utilitarian<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;design, a buffer between the Metro escalator and the outdoors, it <br/>
 </span></blockquote>somehow<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;caught the sound and bounced it back round and resonant. The <br/>
 </span></blockquote>violin is an<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;instrument that is said to be much like the human voice, and in <br/>
 </span></blockquote>this<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;musician&#39;s masterly hands, it sobbed and laughed and sang -- <br/>
 </span></blockquote>ecstatic,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;sorrowful, importuning, adoring, flirtatious, castigating, playful,<br/>
&gt; &gt;romancing, merry, triumphal, sumptuous.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;So, what do you think happened?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;HANG ON, WE&#39;LL GET YOU SOME EXPERT HELP.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Leonard Slatkin, music director of the National Symphony <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Orchestra, was<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;asked the same question. What did he think would occur, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>hypothetically, if<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;one of the world&#39;s great violinists had performed incognito before <br/>
 </span></blockquote>a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;traveling rush-hour audience of 1,000-odd people?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;Let&#39;s assume,&quot; Slatkin said, &quot;that he is not recognized and just <br/>
 </span></blockquote>taken for<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;granted as a street musician . . . Still, I don&#39;t think that if <br/>
 </span></blockquote>he&#39;s really<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;good, he&#39;s going to go unnoticed. He&#39;d get a larger audience in <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Europe . . <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;.<br/>
&gt; &gt;but, okay, out of 1,000 people, my guess is there might be 35 or <br/>
 </span></blockquote>40 who <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;will<br/>
&gt; &gt;recognize the quality for what it is. Maybe 75 to 100 will stop <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and spend<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;some time listening.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;So, a crowd would gather?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;Oh, yes.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;And how much will he make?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;About $150.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Thanks, Maestro. As it happens, this is not hypothetical. It really<br/>
&gt; &gt;happened.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;How&#39;d I do?&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;We&#39;ll tell you in a minute.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;Well, who was the musician?&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Joshua Bell.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;NO!!!&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;A onetime child prodigy, at 39 Joshua Bell has arrived as an <br/>
&gt; &gt;internationally<br/>
&gt; &gt;acclaimed virtuoso. Three days before he appeared at the Metro <br/>
 </span></blockquote>station, <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;Bell<br/>
&gt; &gt;had filled the house at Boston&#39;s stately Symphony Hall, where <br/>
 </span></blockquote>merely pretty<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;good seats went for $100. Two weeks later, at the Music Center at<br/>
&gt; &gt;Strathmore, in North Bethesda, he would play to a standing-room-<br/>
 </span></blockquote>only<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;audience so respectful of his artistry that they stifled their <br/>
 </span></blockquote>coughs until<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;the silence between movements. But on that Friday in January, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Joshua Bell<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;was just another mendicant, competing for the attention of busy <br/>
 </span></blockquote>people on<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;their way to work.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Bell was first pitched this idea shortly before Christmas, over <br/>
 </span></blockquote>coffee at a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;sandwich shop on Capitol Hill. A New Yorker, he was in town to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>perform at<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;the Library of Congress and to visit the library&#39;s vaults to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>examine an<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;unusual treasure: an 18th-century violin that once belonged to the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>great<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;Austrian-born virtuoso and composer Fritz Kreisler. The curators <br/>
 </span></blockquote>invited<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;Bell to play it; good sound, still.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;Here&#39;s what I&#39;m thinking,&quot; Bell confided, as he sipped his <br/>
 </span></blockquote>coffee. &quot;I&#39;m<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;thinking that I could do a tour where I&#39;d play Kreisler&#39;s <br/>
 </span></blockquote>music . . .&quot;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;He smiled.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;. . . on Kreisler&#39;s violin.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;It was a snazzy, sequined idea -- part inspiration and part <br/>
 </span></blockquote>gimmick -- and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;it was typical of Bell, who has unapologetically embraced <br/>
 </span></blockquote>showmanship even<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;as his concert career has become more and more august. He&#39;s soloed <br/>
 </span></blockquote>with the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;finest orchestras here and abroad, but he&#39;s also appeared <br/>
 </span></blockquote>on &quot;Sesame<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;Street,&quot; done late-night talk TV and performed in feature films. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>That was<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;Bell playing the soundtrack on the 1998 movie &quot;The Red Violin.&quot; (He<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;that their son had strung rubber bands across his dresser drawers <br/>

&gt; &gt;TO GET TO THE METRO FROM HIS HOTEL, a distance of three blocks, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Bell took a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;taxi. He&#39;s neither lame nor lazy: He did it for his violin.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Bell always performs on the same instrument, and he ruled out <br/>
 </span></blockquote>using another<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;for this gig. Called the Gibson ex Huberman, it was handcrafted in <br/>
 </span></blockquote>1713 by<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;Antonio Stradivari during the Italian master&#39;s &quot;golden period,&quot; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>toward the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;end of his career, when he had access to the finest spruce, maple <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;willow, and when his technique had been refined to perfection.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;Our knowledge of acoustics is still incomplete,&quot; Bell said, &quot;but <br/>
 </span></blockquote>he, he<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;just . . . knew.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Bell doesn&#39;t mention Stradivari by name. Just &quot;he.&quot; When the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>violinist <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;shows<br/>
&gt; &gt;his Strad to people, he holds the instrument gingerly by its neck, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>resting<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;it on a knee. &quot;He made this to perfect thickness at all parts,&quot; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Bell says,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;pivoting it. &quot;If you shaved off a millimeter of wood at any point, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>it would<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;totally imbalance the sound.&quot; No violins sound as wonderful as <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Strads from<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;the 1710s, still.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;The front of Bell&#39;s violin is in nearly perfect condition, with a <br/>
 </span></blockquote>deep, <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;rich<br/>
&gt; &gt;grain and luster. The back is a mess, its dark reddish finish <br/>
 </span></blockquote>bleeding away<br/>

 </span></blockquote>wood.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;This has never been refinished,&quot; Bell said. &quot;That&#39;s his original <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;People attribute aspects of the sound to the varnish. Each maker <br/>
 </span></blockquote>had his <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;own<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;the Polish virtuoso Bronislaw Huberman. The first time, in 1919, it<br/>
&gt; &gt;disappeared from Huberman&#39;s hotel room in Vienna but was quickly <br/>
 </span></blockquote>returned.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;The second time, nearly 20 years later, it was pinched from his <br/>
 </span></blockquote>dressing<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;room in Carnegie Hall. He never got it back. It was not until 1985 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>that the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;thief -- a minor New York violinist -- made a deathbed confession <br/>
 </span></blockquote>to his<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;wife, and produced the instrument.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Bell bought it a few years ago. He had to sell his own Strad and <br/>
 </span></blockquote>borrow <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;much<br/>
&gt; &gt;of the rest. The price tag was reported to be about $3.5 million.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;All of which is a long explanation for why, in the early morning <br/>

 </span></blockquote>of a mind<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;to take note.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Bell decided to begin with &quot;Chaconne&quot; from Johann Sebastian Bach&#39;s <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Partita<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;No. 2 in D Minor. Bell calls it &quot;not just one of the greatest <br/>
 </span></blockquote>pieces of<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;music ever written, but one of the greatest achievements of any <br/>
 </span></blockquote>man in<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;history. It&#39;s a spiritually powerful piece, emotionally powerful,<br/>
&gt; &gt;structurally perfect. Plus, it was written for a solo violin, so I <br/>
 </span></blockquote>won&#39;t be<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;cheating with some half-assed version.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Bell didn&#39;t say it, but Bach&#39;s &quot;Chaconne&quot; is also considered one <br/>
 </span></blockquote>of the <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;most<br/>
&gt; &gt;difficult violin pieces to master. Many try; few succeed. It&#39;s <br/>
 </span></blockquote>exhaustingly<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;long -- 14 minutes -- and consists entirely of a single, succinct <br/>
 </span></blockquote>musical<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;progression repeated in dozens of variations to create a <br/>
 </span></blockquote>dauntingly complex<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;architecture of sound. Composed around 1720, on the eve of the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>European<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;Enlightenment, it is said to be a celebration of the breadth of <br/>
 </span></blockquote>human<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;possibility.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;If Bell&#39;s encomium to &quot;Chaconne&quot; seems overly effusive, consider <br/>
 </span></blockquote>this from<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;the 19th-century composer Johannes Brahms, in a letter to Clara <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Schumann:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&quot;On one stave, for a small instrument, the man writes a whole <br/>
 </span></blockquote>world of the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;deepest thoughts and most powerful feelings. If I imagined that I <br/>
 </span></blockquote>could <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;have<br/>
&gt; &gt;created, even conceived the piece, I am quite certain that the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>excess of<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;excitement and earth-shattering experience would have driven me <br/>
 </span></blockquote>out of my<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;mind.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;So, that&#39;s the piece Bell started with.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;He&#39;d clearly meant it when he promised not to cheap out this <br/>
 </span></blockquote>performance: <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;He<br/>
&gt; &gt;played with acrobatic enthusiasm, his body leaning into the music <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;arching on tiptoes at the high notes. The sound was nearly <br/>
 </span></blockquote>symphonic,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;carrying to all parts of the homely arcade as the pedestrian <br/>
 </span></blockquote>traffic filed<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;past.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Three minutes went by before something happened. Sixty-three <br/>
 </span></blockquote>people had<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;already passed when, finally, there was a breakthrough of sorts. A<br/>
&gt; &gt;middle-age man altered his gait for a split second, turning his <br/>
 </span></blockquote>head to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;notice that there seemed to be some guy playing music. Yes, the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>man kept<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;walking, but it was something.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;A half-minute later, Bell got his first donation. A woman threw in <br/>
 </span></blockquote>a buck<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;and scooted off. It was not until six minutes into the performance <br/>
 </span></blockquote>that<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;someone actually stood against a wall, and listened.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Things never got much better. In the three-quarters of an hour <br/>
 </span></blockquote>that Joshua<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;Bell played, seven people stopped what they were doing to hang <br/>
 </span></blockquote>around and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;take in the performance, at least for a minute. Twenty-seven gave <br/>
 </span></blockquote>money,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;most of them on the run -- for a total of $32 and change. That <br/>
 </span></blockquote>leaves the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;1,070 people who hurried by, oblivious, many only three feet away, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>few even<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;turning to look.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;No, Mr. Slatkin, there was never a crowd, not even for a second.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;It was all videotaped by a hidden camera. You can play the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>recording once <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;or<br/>
&gt; &gt;15 times, and it never gets any easier to watch. Try speeding it <br/>
 </span></blockquote>up, and it<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;becomes one of those herky-jerky World War I-era silent newsreels. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>The<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;people scurry by in comical little hops and starts, cups of coffee <br/>
 </span></blockquote>in their<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;hands, cellphones at their ears, ID tags slapping at their <br/>
 </span></blockquote>bellies, a grim<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;danse macabre to indifference, inertia and the dingy, gray rush of<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;picking<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;happened<br/>
&gt; &gt;back there at the Metro.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;At the beginning,&quot; Bell says, &quot;I was just concentrating on <br/>
 </span></blockquote>playing the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;music. I wasn&#39;t really watching what was happening around me . . .&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Playing the violin looks all-consuming, mentally and physically, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>but Bell<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;says that for him the mechanics of it are partly second nature, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>cemented by<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;practice and muscle memory: It&#39;s like a juggler, he says, who can <br/>
 </span></blockquote>keep <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;those<br/>
&gt; &gt;balls in play while interacting with a crowd. What he&#39;s mostly <br/>
 </span></blockquote>thinking<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;about as he plays, Bell says, is capturing emotion as a <br/>
 </span></blockquote>narrative: &quot;When <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;you<br/>
&gt; &gt;play a violin piece, you are a storyteller, and you&#39;re telling a <br/>
 </span></blockquote>story.&quot;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;With &quot;Chaconne,&quot; the opening is filled with a building sense of <br/>
 </span></blockquote>awe. That<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;kept him busy for a while. Eventually, though, he began to steal a <br/>
 </span></blockquote>sidelong<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;glance.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;It was a strange feeling, that people were actually, ah . . .&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;The word doesn&#39;t come easily.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;. . . ignoring me.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Bell is laughing. It&#39;s at himself.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;At a music hall, I&#39;ll get upset if someone coughs or if someone&#39;s <br/>
&gt; &gt;cellphone<br/>
&gt; &gt;goes off. But here, my expectations quickly diminished. I started <br/>
 </span></blockquote>to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;appreciate any acknowledgment, even a slight glance up. I was <br/>
 </span></blockquote>oddly <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;grateful<br/>
&gt; &gt;when someone threw in a dollar instead of change.&quot; This is from a <br/>
 </span></blockquote>man whose<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;talents can command $1,000 a minute.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Before he began, Bell hadn&#39;t known what to expect. What he does <br/>
 </span></blockquote>know is<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;that, for some reason, he was nervous.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;It wasn&#39;t exactly stage fright, but there were butterflies,&quot; he <br/>
 </span></blockquote>says. &quot;I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;was stressing a little.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Bell has played, literally, before crowned heads of Europe. Why <br/>
 </span></blockquote>the anxiety<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;at the Washington Metro?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;When you play for ticket-holders,&quot; Bell explains, &quot;you are already<br/>
&gt; &gt;validated. I have no sense that I need to be accepted. I&#39;m already <br/>

&gt; &gt;On the video, you can see Mortensen get off the escalator and look <br/>
 </span></blockquote>around.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;He locates the violinist, stops, walks away but then is drawn <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;says, &quot;it made me feel at peace.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;So, for the first time in his life, Mortensen lingers to listen to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>a street<br/>

 </span></blockquote>PAINFUL TO<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;RELIVE: &quot;The awkward times,&quot; he calls them. It&#39;s what happens <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;-- and begins the next piece.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;After &quot;Chaconne,&quot; it is Franz Schubert&#39;s &quot;Ave Maria,&quot; which <br/>
 </span></blockquote>surprised some<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;music critics when it debuted in 1825: Schubert seldom showed <br/>
 </span></blockquote>religious<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;feeling in his compositions, yet &quot;Ave Maria&quot; is a breathtaking <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Schubert <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;dryly<br/>
&gt; &gt;answered: &quot;I think this is due to the fact that I never forced <br/>
 </span></blockquote>devotion in<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;myself and never compose hymns or prayers of that kind unless it <br/>
 </span></blockquote>overcomes<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;me unawares; but then it is usually the right and true devotion.&quot; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>This<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;musical prayer became among the most familiar and enduring <br/>
 </span></blockquote>religious pieces<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;in history.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;A couple of minutes into it, something revealing happens. A woman <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and her<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;preschooler emerge from the escalator. The woman is walking <br/>
 </span></blockquote>briskly and,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;therefore, so is the child. She&#39;s got his hand.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&quot;I had a time crunch,&quot; recalls Sheron Parker, an IT director for a <br/>
 </span></blockquote>federal<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;agency. &quot;I had an 8:30 training class, and first I had to rush <br/>

 </span></blockquote>in the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;basement.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Evvie is her son, Evan. Evan is 3.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;You can see Evan clearly on the video. He&#39;s the cute black kid in <br/>
 </span></blockquote>the parka<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;who keeps twisting around to look at Joshua Bell, as he is being <br/>
 </span></blockquote>propelled<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;toward the door.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;There was a musician,&quot; Parker says, &quot;and my son was intrigued. He <br/>
 </span></blockquote>wanted <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt;pull over and listen, but I was rushed for time.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;So Parker does what she has to do. She deftly moves her body <br/>
 </span></blockquote>between Evan&#39;s<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;and Bell&#39;s, cutting off her son&#39;s line of sight. As they exit the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>arcade,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;Evan can still be seen craning to look. When Parker is told what <br/>
 </span></blockquote>she walked<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;Evan is very smart!&quot;<br/>

&gt; &gt;The poet Billy Collins once laughingly observed that all babies <br/>
 </span></blockquote>are born<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;with a knowledge of poetry, because the lub-dub of the mother&#39;s <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;out<br/>
&gt; &gt;of us. It may be true with music, too.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;There was no ethnic or demographic pattern to distinguish the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>people who<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;stayed to watch Bell, or the ones who gave money, from that vast <br/>
 </span></blockquote>majority<br/>

 </span></blockquote>behavior of <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;one<br/>

&gt; &gt;&quot;You could tell in one second that this guy was good, that he was <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;professional,&quot; Tindley says. He plays the guitar, loves the sound <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-306286162">That totally breaks my heart!  I hope I&#39;ll remember this story when I <br/>
find myself in a hurry, maybe I&#39;ll slow down and try to see something <br/>
interesting going on around me.  <br/>
<br/>
Lately, I&#39;ve sort of been feeling lost in the *lack* of culture in <br/>
our suburban lifestyle.  I get frustrated, because there are *places* <br/>
and *people* all around, but nobody is interacting with each other <br/>
(except in planned events), and every space seems to be *managed* by <br/>
someone.  We have to *go* to other places, like downtown Dallas, to <br/>
*do* things that are interesting and cultured.  Aren&#39;t we supposed to <br/>
live *in* a culture?  <br/>
<br/>
The city we live in has *planted* wildflower areas every spring, <br/>
mostly on the street dividers and in front of city buildings; <br/>
homeowners go through great lengths to maintain a manicured lawn, to <br/>
keep neighborhoods nice; *everything* feels surrounded by pavement- <br/>
like we&#39;re living in a giant flowerpot.  Sometimes it seems to me <br/>
that we&#39;ve created a kind of anti-culture.<br/>
<br/>
I hope I&#39;m wrong.  I&#39;m in a weird funk this morning, so it&#39;s possible <br/>
I&#39;m just a negative *blah* right now, and things aren&#39;t really that <br/>
bad. (((sigh)))<br/>
