My  questions are 1) Is Deschooling a lifelong process and does it <br/>
get any  easier? &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Yes and yes.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m about as radical an unschooler as you can get, and I STILL have to  check <br/>
myself for &quot;schoolthink&quot;. But it DOES  get easier----just like  anything <br/>
else: the more you DO it, ....<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;2) Do unschoolers have playgroups or coops  ?&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>As far as I can tell, the *biggest* one is the Live and Learn Unschooling  <br/>
Conference, this year in Peabody, MA August 27-29! <br/>
 <br/>
But many local groups have been established all across the country. The NC  <br/>
group would leave you green with envy! They plan trips and play days and park  <br/>
days and movie nights and---all sorts of things! They&#39;re great! There&#39;s one in <br/>
 So CA that has a weekly park day. There are groups in GA and OH and MI and <br/>
NY  and CT and ....all over. If there&#39;s not one where you are, you might want <br/>
to  start one. <br/>

address handy?<br/>
 <br/>
Make up a yahoogroup (like this one)---free and easy. Send invites out to  <br/>
homeschool groups in your area. <br/>
 <br/>
Make flyers that you post at parks and libraries and health food stores  <br/>
(unschooling attracts the crunchy/granola types! &lt;g&gt;), LLL  meetings----places <br/>
where you might find like-minded souls. Just mention  that there is an <br/>
unschooling park day every Tuesday at noon at a certain park.  You might be the only one <br/>
that shows for a while, but keep going----you&#39;ll meet  someone eventually!<br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s how I started here in Columbia. It eventually resulted in an  <br/>
international conference! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-761801078">Hi everyone<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Helen, from Geneva, beginning her second year of unschooling with <br/>
Sylvain (almost 7 yo) and his 2 sisters, Cyrielle and Circé (5 <br/>
and ... 2).<br/>
<br/>
First, I would like to thank you once again. Reading you is really <br/>
inspiring. What you say makes so much sense and is so liberating. <br/>
When I feel a bit down, puff, I come back to UB and read a few posts <br/>
and it makes me feel soooo much better. I used to be part of a list <br/>
arond non-violent education, which doesn&#39;t exist anymore, and it is <br/>
the first time that I feel like that since then. THANKS.<br/>
<br/>
My questions are :<br/>
<br/>
- how do you manage to keep the balance between being there for them <br/>
and still doing what you love (I mean : the OTHERS things that you <br/>
love) and, on the other hand, between not *teaching* them things but <br/>
still sharing with them, between letting them free and proposing <br/>
things, etc. Very often, if I only propose things, they are not <br/>
really interested and would rather stay at home and play - but if we <br/>
do stay at home, after a certain while, we&#39;re not having such a great <br/>
time. It&#39;s like they really need to move and see other things and be <br/>
a little &quot;led&quot; ... I find the balance difficult to find - I know you <br/>
don&#39;t have any miraculous recipe, but I&#39;m still interested in how you <br/>
are doing.<br/>
<br/>
- the other thing is around &quot;curricular&quot; activities (not very sure of <br/>
my English, there). I don&#39;t know how to phrase my question, there are <br/>
different levels in it : first, my son wants me to make lessons with <br/>
him, and asks me for them; second, it is something I like, playing <br/>
with words, with numbers, with nice plastic material etc. - and I <br/>
like doing that with him and his sister; third, here in Geneva, <br/>
homeschooled kids are tested in French and mathematics every year and <br/>
must keep up with the school level (same progression, same order, <br/>
same rhythm). So if I want to be authorized to go on <br/>
with &quot;unschooling&quot;, well, I have to ... not really unschool. I have <br/>
to train him for the tests, somehow, which means making these <br/>
activities - or at least a minimum of them. Any advice here ? Do you <br/>
think that curricular activities could be &quot;harmful&quot; for them - and <br/>
for our unschooling journey ?<br/>
<br/>
Hoping you understand me :)<br/>
<br/>
Regards from this side of the Atlantic ocean ...<br/>
Helen</div>

over; beautiful!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I just wanted to share about our day today, doing this...it was such <br/>
a lovely fall day, and we decided to take a walk in the woods.  We <br/>
all kept pointing things out to each other, mushrooms, pretty leaves, <br/>
interesting rocks...I might suggest something; skipping a little <br/>
ways...the girls might suggest something; licking a cow&#39;s salt block <br/>
(lol)...Daddy might suggest something; he kept checking under trees <br/>
for owl pellets.  The things is, we were all doing what we chose, <br/>
together, but no one felt compelled to, say, lick a cow&#39;s salt block <br/>
unless they really wanted to.  We came upon some really big trees cut <br/>
down, and I wanted to count the rings to see how old they were, the <br/>
girls and Daddy went on and did something else.  The point is, I <br/>
think, is that things are offered without an expectation.  The <br/>
freedom to choose is a powerful thing. :)<br/>
