<div id="ygrps-yiv-288688508">&quot;&gt;&gt;As I asked, how do I re-do 11 years and start over?&gt;&gt;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The bad news is, you can&#39;t.<br/>
The good news is, you are still alive and healthy and you can make<br/>
better choices starting right now!! Cool eh?:)<br/>
Regret is normal when we learn new skills and gather new tools. But if<br/>
you really think about it, you didn&#39;t HAVE those tools and skills, so<br/>
how could you have used them at the time?<br/>
<br/>
You couldn&#39;t. So in a sense there is no regret, only learning.<br/>
Focus on the joy of today. Focus on what a perfect, whole and<br/>
wonderful child you have and how to make his world bigger and brighter<br/>
today.<br/>
Maybe today you will simply help him with his chores, maybe you won&#39;t<br/>
mention them, but do them for him and ask for his help sweetly.<br/>
<br/>
A better life is built around better days, and better days are built<br/>
around making a better choice right now. That&#39;s all. So simple and so<br/>
difficult (only because we make it difficult) at the same time. Just<br/>
make a good choice for the moment and pretty soon all those nice<br/>
moments will add up to really beautiful memories.<br/>
<br/>
Fanny Crosby said &quot;Live in the moment and make it so beautiful that it<br/>
will be worth remembering.&quot;<br/>
