<div id="ygrps-yiv-1972108891">That&#39;s my daughter (14).   She decided to register for the local public<br/>
school&#39;s charter program (project based learning) so we&#39;re busy making<br/>
her experiences fit a transcript and catching her up academically. <br/>
She&#39;s quite excited about this and I don&#39;t blame her.  It sounds<br/>
terribly fun.  However, the realist in me recognizes that it&#39;s not going<br/>
to be all fun, but lots of hard work,  and even though it&#39;s project<br/>
based there will be academic requirements that are likely to challenge<br/>
her (and not in a good way).  She expects it to be hard, but at age 14,<br/>
I think she can&#39;t really visualize it like I can.  Maybe I&#39;m just<br/>
pessimistic,  I don&#39;t know.  I&#39;ll do everything I can to help her<br/>
succeed, but I&#39;ve come to realize (finally) why this is so appealing to<br/>
her - she&#39;s lonely, bored and restless.<br/>
<br/>
In our town, most homsechooled teens are absorbed into the public school<br/>
environment and those of us who are not, are left to hear the crickets<br/>
chirp.  The next town over has a sizable unschooling group with park<br/>
days every week but my kids are no long willing to go.  They feel like<br/>
outsiders, and that makes them feel uncomfortable.   I&#39;m not sure what<br/>
makes them feel like outsiders, but in any case, they won&#39;t go.  They<br/>
tell me I can go myself.  ;)  She&#39;s not interested in taking local<br/>
classes like photography or cake decorating or things that would<br/>
generally appeal to her and I think it&#39;s because she wants to be with<br/>
other teens.  I can&#39;t blame her and I can&#39;t figure out how to provide<br/>
that for her.  At the very least, I want her to enjoy this summer before<br/>
school starts but in the back of my head I&#39;m also thinking if she<br/>
doesn&#39;t want to continue with this school, I don&#39;t want her to dread<br/>
coming home.   She has enough learning challenges that I suspect she&#39;s<br/>
not going to enjoy the school experience very long, so I&#39;m trying to<br/>
figure out how to meet her social need, but I&#39;m stuck.<br/>
Help?<br/>
<br/>

I&#39;ve been deathly sick for more than a week and I&#39;m certain this is going to come off harshly. Still it needs to be said.<br/>
<br/>
As long as your daughter&#39;s needs for socialization and getting out of the house are seen as less urgent than her brother&#39;s need to stay home, you will all remain stuck. His anxiety is being allowed to run her life, as well as his own. Not fair. <br/>
<br/>
These aren&#39;t separate issues or separate topics. She can&#39;t count on you to help her get what or where she needs to go.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry. Have to go sleep again. :/<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1061654888">I hear you there.<br/>
They&#39;re not separate issues, I can see that now.<br/>
With each question I ask here, I find there&#39;s a deeper issue than the<br/>
one I&#39;ve identified.  Thanks for helping me identify this one.<br/>
I hope you feel better soon.<br/>
