<div id="ygrps-yiv-1012956671">&quot;If he just wants to enlist at 18, he *might* need a diploma. I&#39;m not sure how keen the armed services are about taking homeschoolers.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t tell you how accurate this is, but I&#39;ve heard you just need a GED. I&#39;ve also heard from other homeschoolers, that the military is trying to come up with new guidelines specifically for homeschoolers. <br/>
Maybe someone can verify whether this is accurate or not.<br/>
