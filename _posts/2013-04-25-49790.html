<br/>
There&#39;s several pages and links about teens and college at the National Homeschoolers Netwrok:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-551506932">Hi Claire --<br/>
<br/>
You should also visit the Bright Futures site (see public and private institutions) to see the sort of classes that should be listed on the transcript. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.floridastudentfinancialaid.org/ssfad/bf/">http://www.floridastudentfinancialaid.org/ssfad/bf/</a><br/>
<br/>
Whatever part of that you can include would be good. Include 9th-12th grades, course name, course code, and subject area (see the BF site&#39;s Comprehensive Course Table for that info), grade received, credits, all of the usual contact info plus your son&#39;s social security number (you&#39;ll need to give it to them even if you don&#39;t want to have it on the transcript), SAT and/or ACT and/or PERT scores, and number of community service hours. <br/>
<br/>
List me as Director. List FU as a private school. <br/>
<br/>
Use any format you like but keep it simple. One page is good. Don&#39;t agonize. If he read, that&#39;s English I for 9th grade, etc. He will need to take the PERT no matter what to determine if he&#39;s ready for college-level math and reading and he will be placed according to that for some classes, like math. <br/>
<br/>
If you let the college know your son was homeschooled under an umbrella school, they will accept the transcript from you and won&#39;t ask that a sealed version be sent from the school. <br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s it. Good luck!<br/>
<br/>
