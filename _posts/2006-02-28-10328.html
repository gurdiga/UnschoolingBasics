<div id="ygrps-yiv-1650220887">I told myself if another post on this subject came up,<br/>
I would have to comment and lo and behold look what<br/>
shows up.  I will try to keep it short.<br/>
<br/>
I have 6 kids.  Before my divorce we owned and<br/>
operated an organic farm.  We have always had a<br/>
&quot;healthy&quot; lifestyle and my ex-husband has many issues<br/>
with food resulting in his being the biggest food Nazi<br/>
alive.  Everything was &quot;safe&quot; and &quot;healthy&quot; right down<br/>
to the shampoo, toothpaste, cleaning products, etc. <br/>
So safe and healthy it was almost insane.  Despite it<br/>
all, on May 25, 2005 my 8 year old daughter Jossilyn<br/>
was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML which<br/>
is more rare than ALL to which Hannah Jenner so<br/>
recently succombed.)   In Aug. 2005, she received a<br/>
BMT (bone marrow transplant) courtesy of my 4 year old<br/>
daughter Kaylin.  We have been very fortunate and she<br/>
is doing very well, though it has been a long road to<br/>
travel.<br/>
<br/>
My point here is that life is just too damn short. <br/>
Despite all the precautions you may take, stuff<br/>
happens.  I am not usually one to dwell on the<br/>
&quot;why&quot;--especially when our focus had to be on getting<br/>
her well.  But all this discussion insinuates itself<br/>
into my brain and tries to make me feel guilty.  (OMG<br/>
what did I do wrong that caused Jossil to get<br/>
cancer?!)  That is pointless and unproductive.<br/>
<br/>
If you make a big deal out of food it will become a<br/>
big deal.  If you don&#39;t want your 2 year old<br/>
overloading on sugar, just don&#39;t have it in the house,<br/>
but don&#39;t make it &quot;forbidden fruit.&quot;  Everything in<br/>
moderation is fine.  It is easy to instill a love of<br/>
&quot;good&quot; (read &quot;healthy&quot;) food in most kids.  After we<br/>
moved away from our farm and their father, my kids had<br/>
a couple of months of sugar overload.  If they wanted<br/>
it, I bought it.  If they wanted to eat ice cream for<br/>
breakfast, I let &#39;em.  But I still have the same<br/>
&quot;healthy&quot; habits and buy the stuff we always have.  It<br/>
soon became a non-issue.  Even the 2 and 4 year olds<br/>
will turn down ice cream or candy in favor of sliced<br/>
tomatoes  or cucumbers or grapes, etc.<br/>
<br/>
My children are smart children.  I trust them to make<br/>
their OWN choices with no qualifiers attached (as in<br/>
&quot;good&quot; meaning the choices I want them to make)  It is<br/>
not always easy having 7 independent people in one<br/>
house but I will take it over the alternative.<br/>
<br/>
The path my daughter&#39;s cancer took us down gave new<br/>
meaning to living in the moment.  Things can take a<br/>
turn for the worse and in a heartbeat, you are<br/>
watching your child deteriorate right before your<br/>
eyes.  And there really is no rhyme nor reason to it. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Reading about Hannah was tough for me.  It could so<br/>
easily have been my child.  I read the blog.  It<br/>
brought everything back so clearly.  Although protocol<br/>
differs for AML and ALL (AML protocol proceeds faster)<br/>
Jossilyn received many of the same chemo meds, had the<br/>
same reactions, etc.  I was very much reminded, IT<br/>
COULD HAVE BEEN MY CHILD.  And we are not out of the<br/>
woods yet.  The threat of GVH haunts me, even at this<br/>
date.  The thought that there could be a relapse never<br/>
leaves my mind. It STILL COULD be my child.  I think<br/>
it is a good thing that I am not a control freak.  One<br/>
would be a complete basket case.<br/>
<br/>
I have meandered from the topic, I suppose.  But I<br/>
hope my point has been made.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; Any oil you are eating that isn&#39;t IN the food is<br/>
&gt; processed in some<br/>
&gt; &gt; manner. That&#39;s not a bad thing. It takes<br/>
&gt; processing to get Olive oil<br/>
&gt; &gt; or butter or any other pure fat. That in itself<br/>
&gt; does not make<br/>
&gt; &gt; something less healthy.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; ****Well there are exceptions to everything. Ya<br/>
&gt; got me there! :o) I guess I <br/>
&gt; &gt; should have clarified that a bit more. Obviously,<br/>
&gt; to eat butter and olive <br/>
&gt; &gt; oil, you have to eat something that has been<br/>
&gt; &quot;processed.&quot; You can also buy olive <br/>
&gt; &gt; oil & butter with pesticides and, etc., OR you can<br/>
&gt; buy organic olive oil & <br/>
&gt; &gt; butter. I was meaning for example, say, farina,<br/>
&gt; (and oatmeal too) you can buy <br/>
&gt; &gt; certain brands and they will say their ingredients<br/>
&gt; are just plain 100% farina <br/>
&gt; &gt; or oatmeal but the way that it&#39;s &quot;processed&quot; can<br/>
&gt; (maybe not always, but can) <br/>
&gt; &gt; leave little to nutrition along with the fact that<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s &quot;processed&quot; with <br/>
&gt; &gt; pesticides as opposed to &quot;processed&quot; organically.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  just joined a local hs&#39;s food co-op recently<br/>
&gt; and I was happy to see when <br/>
&gt; &gt; I ordered some farina the label said &quot;.....Organic<br/>
&gt; and is complete in every <br/>
&gt; &gt; respect. It contains all the wheat germ with it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; precious oil, all the fiber <br/>
&gt; &gt; from the outer bran layer of the wheat and all the<br/>
&gt; protein from the inner <br/>
&gt; &gt; endosperm.&quot; There are other brands that, with<br/>
&gt; their processing, may end up <br/>
&gt; &gt; stripping the wheat germ of a lot of those<br/>
&gt; nutrients.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;    We are also lucky enough to live near an old mill<br/>
&gt; (built back in the late <br/>
&gt; 1800s, SO        cool) that a local family bought a<br/>
&gt; few yrs. back, got it up <br/>
&gt; and running again and farms all organic, grinds and<br/>
&gt; sells it&#39;s own flours, <br/>
&gt; oatmeal, herbs, legumes, meat, etc. They also sell<br/>
&gt; other local farmers organic <br/>
&gt; goods too. Talking to them about what goes on with<br/>
&gt; the way that our food source <br/>
&gt; is so over processed can be depressing.&lt;big sigh&gt;<br/>
&gt; How sad it is.<br/>
&gt; Although we have never made the kids eat anything<br/>
&gt; they don&#39;t like, food has <br/>
&gt; been a bit of an issue in our home with this<br/>
&gt; wonderful unschooling lifestyle <br/>
&gt; and I&#39;m trying to find some balance within it all,<br/>
&gt; that is, without making too <br/>
&gt; much of a big deal of it to my kids, which is not<br/>
&gt; always easy! Kids catch on <br/>
&gt; quick don&#39;t they! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m glad to hear that your daughter is alright now.  I think you made <br/>
a great point!  I believe we need to live a full and enjoyable life <br/>
with our children.  We, for whatever reason, have been given life and <br/>
it should be lived to the fullest.  I almost think we have some <br/>
responsibility to live life that way.  <br/>
<br/>
If we are always thinking of whether something is organic or natural <br/>
enough we might be (I did say might) wasting some of that precious <br/>
time we have.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for posting your personal experience.<br/>
