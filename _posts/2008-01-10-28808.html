<div id="ygrps-yiv-1616095808">We&#39;ve had a great few days and I wanted to share this. <br/>
 <br/>
Yesterday, I began to make a dish that had vinegar in it, and as usual, I  <br/>
asked the kids if they wanted to help. They usually do, of course! So we were  <br/>
getting out the ingredients, and since the chicken had to soak in the <br/>
buttermilk  for a bit, we had some time for expirimenting :) <br/>
 <br/>
We got all the different vinegars out of the pantry and tasted each one. We  <br/>
have:<br/>
 <br/>
apple cider vinegar<br/>
red wine<br/>
white (regular)<br/>
balsamic<br/>
white  balsamic<br/>
 <br/>
We talked about how they taste different and what they are used for and all  <br/>
of that. It was great! This lead to smelling the different spices and stuff in <br/>
 there, too - vanilla, pepper, Old Bay Seasoning, oregano, cloves, alspice,  <br/>
nutmeg...Great fun and hilarious to watch Julian smell the pepper just to make <br/>
 himself sneeze, lol! <br/>
 <br/>
This lead to taking the larger container with lesser seasonsings ion them  <br/>
and shake them...which became an instant &quot;Maracca Time&quot; as Julia called it. They <br/>
 marched upstairs and held a party with the bigger kids. :) Very fun. <br/>
 <br/>
Then, as Julia would tell you, &quot;we tooked!&quot; (cooked) <br/>
 <br/>
During this time, Julian decided not too cook too much (it was a messy  thing <br/>
and he was struggling with that - he hates mess on his hands) and was busy  <br/>
doing Solitaire on the computer. He moved on to Halo just a bit later. <br/>
 <br/>
Today, Julian has been enmeshed in a Baby Story of all things - he watched  a <br/>
few in a row, lol, telling me bits and peices as the show went on. Julia and <br/>
I  cooked some Mexican rice, some chicken and some amazing potatoes, that both <br/>
kids  washed previously. Julia then decided it was a good day to paint, so <br/>
she made 3  painting, one red, two all blue. She says she wants to dye her hair <br/>
blue, so now  I&#39;m wondering about temporary blue for her :) <br/>
 <br/>
Julian has been really interested in reading and it&#39;s fascinating to see  him <br/>
learn how to read. He is doing the same as I did - on his own. It&#39;s so cool  <br/>
to see him progress. Kids read at all different ages, from 3 to 8 seems to be  <br/>
the average, with variences on boith sides, but its really cool with NO <br/>
school  and no &quot;instruction&quot; to see it happen in front of my very eyes. It&#39;s <br/>
helping  when I freak out and decide on workbooks, lol ;) He also has been seeing  <br/>
division and multiplication and is grasping that faster than addition and  <br/>
subtraction. He has a feel for numbers, and all of this in context, which of  <br/>
course makes learning it as easy as pie. <br/>
 <br/>
Julia is thrilled silly with counting and is begining to give value to  <br/>
numbers. She also wants to be a mama and have a baby soon so she can feed it and  <br/>
nurse it. &quot;Newis&quot; is how she says it, lol. <br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;ve also been freezing small toys in plastic containers and playing with  <br/>
the melting ice in the bathtub at night. Science at it&#39;s best, lol. <br/>
 <br/>
No rules. Principles, yes. Funny how I don&#39;t need to punish or reward. <br/>
 <br/>
Just been lovin&#39; our days. <br/>
