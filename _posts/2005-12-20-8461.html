<div id="ygrps-yiv-521976615">Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I have a 6.5 year old son who had an email penpal in Australia. They sent playground pictures back and forth, discussed the weather...all in a couple of sentences at a time.  Of course, I thought it was great....my son asked everyday if &quot;toby&quot; had written back yet..then, nothing. So, if anyone has a son who is looking for an email penpal , please email us privately at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:janqlan@...">janqlan@...</a>. Leyton was born in July and likes to describe himself as :&quot; I have 2 chihuahuas ,I like to play outside and I like to play with silly string and I like to swing and thats it.&quot;:)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Lisa<br/>
