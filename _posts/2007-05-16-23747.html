<div id="ygrps-yiv-1925122475">I wanted to post an intro here tonight. I have lots of time after my <br/>
sis&#39;s wedding this weekend to ponder what is unschooling and how to <br/>
go about doing it or not doing it as I really have only a vague idea <br/>
about what it is.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Laura, 34 yrs at home momma to Kirsten 10 yrs, Brooke 5 yrs, <br/>
Connor 2 yrs and Joshua 9 months and wife to my husband Michael.<br/>
<br/>
I homeschooled myself through 2 yrs of high school and I have a <br/>
massive love of learning. To this day I am a library hound peeling <br/>
books off shelves of stuff I will never even do but want to learn <br/>
about. I liked school(or should I say education) I loved <br/>
homeschooling a million times more, working at my own pace etc. My <br/>
mom told me I would grow up and be a doctor. I even went to college <br/>
majoring in pre-med and dropped out because I only want to be a mom <br/>
have lots of kids and stay at home. I am organized self-motivated and <br/>
completely lost.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter Kirsten went to public school in Kindergarten. We <br/>
were told by her teacher the first week she was slow and needed <br/>
special classes for speech. We had her tested and not only did she <br/>
NOT need any special help she tested several grades above in <br/>
comprehension with understanding topics of conversation well above <br/>
her years. Despite this, her evaluations showed her behind the class <br/>
in reading, phonetics the whole year. By her first grade year, third <br/>
week I had enough of the next teacher and pulled her out of PS to <br/>
teach her myself. <br/>
<br/>
I first did nothing with her for a month. Then apparently I made a <br/>
mistake and start her with book learning, from lifepacs to the well <br/>
trained mind, rod and staff, I tried a lot including unit studies as <br/>
well. She bucked me the whole time. She hates her schoolwork, hates <br/>
learning the stuff I am trying to cram down her throat despite the <br/>
idea that everybody has to learn this. She is not like me but very <br/>
much like her dad who hated schoolwork too. <br/>
<br/>
Then the other day she forgot something and I said to her that she <br/>
was younger than me and should be able to remember things better than <br/>
me. Her reply was that her head was too filled with all the useless <br/>
stuff I make her do during school and thats why she forgot.<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s when the light bulb went on in my head. My last brain cell <br/>
began to tick. I remember about some fanatical idea of unschooling <br/>
and here I am. I have a limited understanding of what it is about and <br/>
thus I will peruse former messages in order to not ask many <br/>
repetitive questions that may clog up the list.<br/>
<br/>
She is a huge fan of the library and often checks out many, many <br/>
books, even needing more bags because her backpack only holds the <br/>
first forty or so books she checks out. She checks out a good amount <br/>
of non-fiction as well as fiction and loves to read. I think there is <br/>
where I will start and just leave her to do her own thing right now. <br/>
She also loves weather related phenomena and twisters, tornados. Her <br/>
dad has plans in the works to take her storm chasing after she turns <br/>
12 yrs old.<br/>
<br/>
My hopes is that I haven&#39;t screwed up her thirst for knowledge too <br/>
much and that I can learn what she wants to learn and what if <br/>
anything I need to do to encourage that.<br/>
<br/>
I forgot to introduce our pets, Kirsten has 3 house rabbits(2 girls <br/>
and one boy)(we initially thought we had three boys but thats another <br/>
story all together) and we also have 3 guinea pigs. House rabbits are <br/>
domesticated rabbits that have free range of our home much like cats <br/>
and dogs do. The guinea pig girls get out of their habitat to run at <br/>
night too. <br/>
<br/>
All our pet friends are rescues. We cloth diaper the rabbits and <br/>
guinea pigs. Which is another fun topic that completely astounds <br/>
people. No they don&#39;t wear the cloth diapers. The prefolds line the <br/>
bottom of their litter pans which then is covered with timothy hay. <br/>
All three rabbits and guinea pigs have habitats I built from organize <br/>
its from target and coroplast from a local plant. You can see the <br/>
ideas from cavycages.com. It wasn&#39;t my idea but it works for us. The <br/>
rabbits then retreat there if the kids get too loud or they want a <br/>
break. Their habitats are lined with fleece blankets over cotton <br/>
ones. Those we change every other day. The litter pan liners we <br/>
change everyday. <br/>
<br/>
My husband is a union firefighter and works every third day for 24 <br/>
hours. He is building his photography business during his off time. <br/>
<br/>
I am already considered radical by my family, friends and neighbors, <br/>
for growing my own garden, homeschooling, not circing the boys, <br/>
homeschooling, breastfeeding, cloth diapering, brewing our own <br/>
beer/cordials, staying at home and raising my kids, not vaxing etc. I <br/>
used to being way out there in my way of thinking outside the box. I <br/>
am pretty sure now they&#39;ll think I left the galaxy but that doesn&#39;t <br/>
bother me in the least.<br/>
<br/>
I am really looking forward to learning here.<br/>
