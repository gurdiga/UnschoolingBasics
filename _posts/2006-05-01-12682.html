 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think that they are a good idea for anyone unschooling :)  These<br/>
books are written for people who are in the &quot;system&quot; even if they are<br/>
homeschooling.  You are still &quot;in the system&quot; if you are comparing what your<br/>
child knows with the &quot;standard&quot; that the public schools set for each grade.<br/>
Your child is going to know what your child needs to know in order to do the<br/>
things that your child wants to do.  Your child doesn&#39;t need to know<br/>
economics, read Shakespeare&#39;s Hamlet, or have a year in state history if<br/>
your child is never going to use those things!  Those books are written for<br/>
the parents who feel that they need to keep up with the standard.  Those<br/>
books are written for people who are schooling at home, even if they don&#39;t<br/>
think they are.<br/>
<br/>
If you are unschooling you are going to trust that your child is going to<br/>
obtain the skills and knowledge that your child needs when your child needs<br/>
those skills and knowledge, not when some book says s/he needs those skills<br/>
and knowledge.  :)<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion?  Make a bit of money off of it and see if you can resell it<br/>
at the used curriculum store in town!  :-D  I&#39;m planning on making a run<br/>
down there myself this week to ditch a ton of curriculum that well meaning<br/>
family and friends have given over the years and are collecting dust.   They<br/>
will even take partially used curriculum (for pennies, but hey, it&#39;s out of<br/>
your house) as many parents are wanting to &quot;take a peek&quot; but not ready to<br/>
invest in a particular program.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-868042339">LMAO at the thought of family sending curriculum!  I have never had to<br/>
do that nor do I hope to encounter it. As far as the used curriculum<br/>
store, are you talking about Rolands or is there another one?  <br/>
<br/>
I was just having an email discussion with Kristi and decided to can<br/>
those books, for the exact reasons you have stated and also because<br/>
until I&#39;m stronger in unschooling, I can easily fall into the trap of<br/>
putting myself and kids back into the &#39;system&#39;.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the input Michelle :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1007310640">I have 2nd through 5th grade sitting on my shelf and we just never use <br/>
them at all.  I was even following the Core Knowledge Sequence for a <br/>
while but I still didn&#39;t have a need to open these books.  My friend <br/>
is using CK too, and she doesn&#39;t use these books at all either.  <br/>
There&#39;s just not enough information to make them helpful.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I read the fairy tales in the 2nd grade book to my daughter and she  <br/>
really liked them (even though the language was stilted and he  <br/>
suggests getting real picture book versions.) The language seemed to  <br/>
have reached her. I can&#39;t explain it.<br/>
<br/>
It reminded me to point out warm and cool colors to her when an  <br/>
appropriate context came up.<br/>
<br/>
And I think I read about Jane Goodall or Dian Fossey to her.<br/>
<br/>
That was our extent. I just used them like any other book. I picked  <br/>
out the things I thought would interest her.<br/>
<br/>
But I think they can make new unschoolers nervous because most kids  <br/>
won&#39;t know the things in those books by the end of the corresponding  <br/>
year. The books don&#39;t help anyone see what *else* the child learned  <br/>
instead that year.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1279015417">When the kids were younger I used to check these books out with our other library books. I&#39;d read the poetry and stories to them when they were looking for something short and new. If someone wanted to try something else in the books I would have helped them, but it never came up. &lt;g&gt; I just used them like any other books.<br/>
