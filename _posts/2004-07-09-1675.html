Don&#39;t you think she&#39;ll change her mind again when she the reality hits<br/>
that you&#39;re taking the other kids to the beach with friends while she&#39;s<br/>
at school &lt;G&gt;? What grade would she be in?<br/>

Well, it&#39;ll have to be some other thing.  The beach doesn&#39;t have much draw<br/>
for Syd at the moment.  She hasn&#39;t had any of her friends come with us very<br/>
often lately.  It may be that she&#39;s kind of &quot;in between&quot; friends right now<br/>
and school seems to her like a place she could belong and make more.  Her<br/>
girl scout troop is off for the summer as is gymnastics etc. so maybe she&#39;s<br/>
bored.<br/>
<br/>
She would technically be going into 4th but I would think 3rd would be a<br/>
better fit.  It annoys me that I even have an opinion on that.  ;b</div>
