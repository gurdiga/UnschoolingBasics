Hello!<br/>
Been trying to send a response to the group since this morning. does <br/>
anyone<br/>
know if there is a yahoo problem?  i cna&#39;t see my messages in the yahoo<br/>
group page.<br/>
<br/>
Since i use gmail.... i first tried sending it from there but then i <br/>
went<br/>
and logged onto the yahoo page and still the message won&#39;t show up in <br/>
the<br/>
new messages.<br/>

Sometimes posts get hijacked and float around in cyberspace for a few <br/>
days---who knows why. I just lost a series of posts that finally showed <br/>
up two days later.<br/>
<br/>
But *your* posts were waiting in the moderator&#39;s file here at the <br/>
group. We moderate new members&#39; posts for a while until we&#39;re sure they <br/>
aren&#39;t spammers or trolls---or just writing posts meant to incite or <br/>
anger.<br/>
<br/>
Because the owners and moderators *do* have lives outside this list <br/>
&lt;g&gt;, we don&#39;t always get to them immediately. Mostly we *do*---with <br/>
four of us, usually someone comes in, reads, and clicks quite <br/>
regularly---often *just* after you post, so you may never know you&#39;re <br/>
on moderation (but all newbies *are* unless we know you from a <br/>
different list). But occasionally, we&#39;re all asleep or cooking supper <br/>
or playing in the yard or out of town. Then it takes a while longer to <br/>
show up. But we get to it as fast as we can! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
