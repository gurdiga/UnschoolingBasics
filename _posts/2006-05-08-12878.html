 </span></blockquote>When I moved to Florida 3 years ago (or maybe it has been 4?) I left Alabama<br/>
for Florida.  I knew that Florida had evaluations, but didn&#39;t know at the<br/>
time that they also had a cover school option.  Had I known that I probably<br/>
would have not put them in public school that year.  Fortunately I found out<br/>
by the time Emily dropped out of school mid-year.  We have talked of moving<br/>
to Texas where another facility that the company my co-parent is employed at<br/>
owns, but there are other issues keeping us from moving to  Texas.  Also, we<br/>
have considered moving back to Oregon and are aware that the Oregon<br/>
homeschooling laws are more strict, but wondering if we could just stay<br/>
under the radar if we moved.  We have also discussed moving back to<br/>
Alabama.  Right now we are waiting to see how the governor&#39;s race turns out<br/>
before we move back.  I refuse to live in a state where Roy Moore is<br/>
governor!  I know we almost moved to Illinois about 8 years ago and were<br/>
looking into their homeschool laws as well.  Isn&#39;t it odd what an<br/>
influencing factor it is?<br/>

It&#39;s crazy, isn&#39;t it?  If Tristan were in PS, schools really wouldn&#39;t play a factor in our decision as to which state we moved to.  When it&#39;s up to DH and I to provide his &quot;education&quot; and prove it to the state, however?  Well, that&#39;s another matter!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll most likely be moving in the next two years or so.  We have been wanting to move back to WA and have been planning on it since we left in 2001, BUT I&#39;ve just glanced at their homeschooling laws.  After being in Alaska where homeschooling laws are so very lax (basically nonexistent!), the WA laws make me break out into a cold sweat. LOL<br/>

homeschooling law in the country, for sure:<br/>
<br/>
*******<br/>
Option 1. Alaska Stat. � 14.30.010(b)(12). If �the child is being  <br/>
educated in the child�s home by a parent<br/>
or legal guardian,� the child is exempt from compulsory attendance.  <br/>
Under this option, there are no<br/>
requirements to notify, seek approval, test, file forms, or have any  <br/>
teacher qualifications. The burden is<br/>
on the state to prove that parents are not teaching their children.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1331251005">Pam, you&#39;re right. :o)  I actually have this printed and in a binder in case anyone wishes to challenge me (I had a scare tactic letter sent to me by Tristan&#39;s school after I pulled him out and had visions of CPS or a truancy officer coming to my door).<br/>
<br/>
My wording of &quot;basically nonexistent&quot; was poorly used.  I meant it in a way meaning that we have no hard and fast &quot;rules&quot; to follow -- no notification, testing, evaluations, or even attendance.  I do know a number of folks who get money from the state every year, but they do have more stringent guidelines that must be followed.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>To be honest, when we were faced with a move, it was after 3 years <br/>
of unemployment, and ANYWHERE where we had an income beat FL without <br/>
one.  But, when we were in the searching phase, I admit that, <br/>
although there would have been a lot of pluses to Albany, NY had he <br/>
gotten a job there (he was a former state employee, so was trying to <br/>
get back in) -- a good solid base of friends, knowledge of the area, <br/>
etc., I was terrified at the prospect of homeschooling there.  Not <br/>
just because of the regs, but also because I had a feeling that <br/>
there would have been far fewer older homeschooling kids, and my son <br/>
is now 14.  (We only moved a year ago.  And 6 months ago....)<br/>
<br/>
So, although the home-ed laws would have influenced my feelings <br/>
about the move, it wouldn&#39;t have changed my mind.  However, all <br/>
other things being equal, I would have probably considered that.<br/>

or &#39;being educated at home&#39; or &#39;homeschooling&#39; or any form thereof <br/>
doesn&#39;t even exist in statute. From the get-go (ca 1650), &quot;A parent <br/>
shall educate, or cause to be educated, their minor child...&quot; (CT <br/>
Gen Statute 10-184)[note the clause there was a later addition to <br/>
the 1650 version of the statute] It does say what they are to be <br/>
educated in (reading, arithmetic, and such) but there is no <br/>
distinction as to HOW a parent may see to this responsibility nor is <br/>
there any &#39;proving&#39; required of the parent. As with Alaska, the <br/>
state needs some evidence of neglect. However, I will note that <br/>
there are some superintendents who (with the complicity of the state <br/>
Dept of Ed) try to add requirements when parents withdraw their kids <br/>
from school. Kids who were never enrolled (either because they moved <br/>
in from another state or because they have been home educated from <br/>
the start) rarely have any issues with the state or the school <br/>
system.<br/>

children will be educated at public school, a private school, tutored at<br/>
home by a professional tutor or a parent who is a certified educator or<br/>
enrolled in a private church school.  If you choose the tutor or certified<br/>
educator route you have to follow state guidelines, curriculum<br/>
recommendations (which why they call the &quot;recommendations&quot; is beyond me<br/>
since they require them), and have to test on schedule with the rest of the<br/>

homeschool.  There is no direct provision for homeschooling.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So, by law, you can enroll your kids in school, school, school or <br/>
school, or have them taught by someone officially approved by the <br/>
school system (tutor or certified educator parent). That&#39;s probably <br/>
about as opposite as it gets from CT where rather than requiring <br/>
enrollment, it simply doesn&#39;t mention HOW education is to happen at <br/>
all. Parents can put together whatever sort of plan they choose <br/>
using whatever resources they want in whatever order makes sense for <br/>
them. Some do public school straight through, some private school, <br/>
some homeschool from the start, some have one kid here and one <br/>
there, some homeschool then the kids take comm college classes, some <br/>
homeschool with lots of outside co-ops and tutors (piano, writing, <br/>
whatever), some are in and out of public and private schools and <br/>
homeschooling (a friend of ours had her 4 in public school the <br/>
homeschooled for a couple years then they went to a small private <br/>
school for high school; another family we know has one kid in public <br/>
school and the others at home right now - all subject to change).<br/>
