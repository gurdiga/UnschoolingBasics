<div id="ygrps-yiv-1111343513"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; ***tantrums***<br/>
&gt; Tantrum is a very negative word.  It implies the person is not really<br/>
&gt; suffering but is just &quot;acting out&quot; for some purpose of manipulation.  If<br/>
&gt; a kid has reached a point of emotional crisis and no on has moved to help<br/>
&gt; him he&#39;s hurt, he&#39;s not having a tantrum.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Deb,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for that beautiful post.  All these adjectives have been used to <br/>
describe our new 2 year old foster child.  Your description of tantrumming is so <br/>
true.  This baby is not manipulative, he is suffering which I already knew.  <br/>
I am going to eliminate the word tantrum from my vocabulary as well as the <br/>
other harmful words.  I have been getting frustrated with this child and am going <br/>
to try harder to meet him where he is at instead of trying to mold him to fit <br/>
into our world.<br/>
<br/>
Ren,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for yet another amazing post.  Your words about how adding another <br/>
child takes away time and attention from our own kids is very true but added <br/>
to my frustration and feelings of inadequacy after I read it.  I justify it by <br/>
thinking that it can also be a growing experience for our kids as well as a <br/>
compassion builder.  We take in foster kids mostly because there are so many out <br/>
there who no one will take in.  This baby has been in 8 homes since July and <br/>
the families give up because of all his &quot;issues&quot; which include: <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; has MAJOR meltdowns and tantrums<br/>
&gt; gets frustrated soooo easily<br/>
&gt; getting extremely angry<br/>
&gt; has some developmental issues, <br/>
&gt; has characteristics of aspergers, adhd, and ppd <br/>
&gt; asks me the same questions over and over and over and over<br/>
&gt; I just have to stop him. Repeatedly.  From smashing things, banging his <br/>
 </span></blockquote>head, etc.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He must be spoken to very simply and plainly.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The truth is, after reading your post yesterday I have been questioning <br/>
whether our choice to take in foster kids is detrimental to our own children and <br/>
maybe we should stop doing it.  I have a very hard time saying no when I get <br/>
these calls.  All this self doubt is your fault, Ren!  I&#39;ve learned so much from <br/>
your wise posts and have come to really trust what you think and your opinion <br/>
matters to me.  As I sat up with William (the foster baby) at 2:30 this <br/>
morning, I was thinking how I&#39;d probably have less patience with my own kids after <br/>
losing sleep again rocking this &quot;extra&quot; child.  I am probably selling out my <br/>
own to help other people&#39;s kids.  Yikes!  With this one high need child in <br/>
particular I realize that the best thing for my kids is to find him another home <br/>
but that&#39;s hard.  <br/>
<br/>
Why do you write these words that cause me to think so much?!?  Just kidding, <br/>
I really do appreciate all your wisdom ladies.  I have to take a long, hard <br/>
look at myself and our family and figure out what&#39;s best.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!  I truly do appreciate your posts even if I don&#39;t want to &quot;hear <br/>
it&quot; it gets into my brain.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and for the frustrated mother who listed the above issues describing her <br/>
son--try hugging him everytime you or he gets frustrated.  It works 95% of the <br/>
time with William.  Comfort is a wonderful tool, regardless of the problem or <br/>
issue.<br/>
<br/>
Peace.<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
Robin in MA, going to hug the husband, who comforts me during my tantrums!<br/>
