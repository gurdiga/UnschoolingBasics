<div id="ygrps-yiv-354170951">I talked to my father today about my decision and he like most people<br/>
had a few things to say.  He told me after all he said that it was<br/>
just an opinion and I can take from it what I paid for it LOL.  So<br/>
even though he said things I didnt totally see eye to eye with him on<br/>
he was totally supportive of me.. I am just now developing a<br/>
relationship with him and this is so much what I needed.<br/>
<br/>
I am not going to go into what he said because I know it was because<br/>
he doesnt really know what unschooling is.  And he wants what is best<br/>
for his grandkids.  Nothing was bad mind you..  <br/>
<br/>
Well what made me to most excited and happy was I discussed with him<br/>
the conference.. I so so so want to go but have no money.  We have had<br/>
a lot of unexpected expenses come up recently.. My eye being the most<br/>
recent.  We have no health insurance for Kheled and myself so<br/>
everything is out of pocket.  Plus we need to repair the car.<br/>
<br/>
Well anyways.. I told him the total cost I needed to cover and he<br/>
talked to his fiance (they getting married tomorrow in Vegas) and are<br/>
going to see if they can do.. Jolene said if this is something that<br/>
needs to be done then we do it.  He has his own business and he has<br/>
had a rough year so far.. But he said as long as he could pay on<br/>
credit card he might be able to do it.. He is buying a $7000 engine on<br/>
next Friday and that is what is putting it on hold.<br/>
<br/>
I hope my family can still go even if we end up only being able to pay<br/>
on the last possible day.. July 31st right?<br/>
<br/>
I also called my mom and she was going to see what she could do too..<br/>
I love that they love me enough to support me and my family in what is<br/>
important to us.</div>

I realize it takes a lot of time and living this lifestyle to help<br/>
convince family sometimes...BUT,<br/>
it&#39;s not &quot;just&quot; an opinion. We&#39;re actually living the unschooling<br/>
lifestlye.<br/>
And people giving freely of their time, does not lessen the value of<br/>
guidance and information. If what you pay was the factor we used to<br/>
create value, then every rape crisis center, hospice caregive and<br/>
peace corp worker would be valueless. <br/>
<br/>
We all know that some of the most valuable gifts have no monetary<br/>
value connected to them. I like to think this list is one such<br/>
provision in this world.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I am not quite sure what you meant by all this.. He meant everything<br/>
that he said was just his opinion and that I could take from it what I<br/>
wanted.  Basically saying he wasnt telling me what to do just what he<br/>
felt and that he agreed with me that my kids needed something more<br/>
then what the school can offer.  I hope you didnt think he said that<br/>
what people were saying about unschooling was just an opinion.</div>

<br/>
Yeah, it sounded like he thought you had gotten information that was<br/>
just an opinion....but it doesn&#39;t really matter what I think. It&#39;s<br/>
cool that he&#39;s willing to support you either way!:)<br/>
