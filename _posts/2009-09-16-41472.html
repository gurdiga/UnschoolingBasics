<div id="ygrps-yiv-579770001">Hello,  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading all the posts and am truly inspired to unschool now more than ever.  My name is Theresa and my son&#39;s name is Bowie(as in David Bowie).  I first started looking into attachment parenting when my son was about 4 months old and have been reading and researching ever since.  I am the only one in my family who practices most forms of attachment parenting.  Right now I am working on deschooling myself.  My son isn&#39;t exactly school age yet.  He&#39;s 15 months old, but I am trying to find out as much as I can and really figure out which type of homeschooling I&#39;d like to do or combine.  I&#39;m really happy to have found this group because it&#39;s really nice to listen to others who are living an unschooling life.  I&#39;m here mostly to be inspired.  I first only thought of homeschooling.  I didn&#39;t even think that I was allowed to unschool my son.  I am really loving the idea of unschooling, but I am a single mom and I was wondering if many single parents choose to unschool.  If you/they do what to you/they do that makes everything work together?  <br/>
<br/>
Thank You,<br/>
Theresa</div>
