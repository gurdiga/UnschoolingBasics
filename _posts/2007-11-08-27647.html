&lt;&lt;What I&#39;ve heard several times is that swearing isn&#39;t the same there. <br/>
When they go at each other they use impolite forms of address and <br/>
impolite forms of words. Which sounds too polite but not so in <br/>
context ;-)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I have heard as well.  <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, we&#39;ve picked up a number of Japanese words ad phrases from watching anime by keeping the Japanese audio track on (and being mindful that some translators tend to take liberties with their choice of words instead of giving a more literal translation).  Our family&#39;s Japanese vocabulary isn&#39;t too large but it is &quot;colorful.&quot; ;o)<br/>

I don&#39;t know of any websites off the top of my head (although I&#39;m sure there are a number of them!), but the few anime forums I frequent tend to have Japanese language threads.  Depending on the forum the folks that are involved in the various anime projects (translators, voice actors, script writers) sometimes pop in and discuss projects.  I&#39;ve learned A LOT about the translation process and the Japanese language from the current head One Piece translator.  Very cool stuff. :o)<br/>
