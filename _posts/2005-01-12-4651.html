<div id="ygrps-yiv-1899572660">Eww, sounds kinda messy, doesn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
This is a little kid question, but I want to run it by all the animal <br/>
lovers I know are here...<br/>
<br/>
My just-turned-two y o dd loves animals and I&#39;d like to find a way to <br/>
get more of them into her life. No, I&#39;m not getting her a puppy right <br/>
now! She&#39;s getting a little brother in 2 months and we&#39;re moving in <br/>
the summer--we&#39;ll talk after that, lol.<br/>
<br/>
She has no fear, which is sometimes okay (I loved watching her with <br/>
Danielle&#39;s chickens) but can be a problem with dogs who don&#39;t like 2 <br/>
yr olds jumping on them. <br/>
<br/>
There are petting zoo type places around, but all are a long drive <br/>
and don&#39;t seem to do much in winter, so we haven&#39;t gotten to them <br/>
yet. I&#39;m going to do another trip to the National Zoo soon--and they <br/>
do have a petting zoo there.<br/>
<br/>
Anywho, just wondering about other experiences with little ones and <br/>
animals that I hadn&#39;t considered.<br/>
<br/>

I would suggest bird feeders and a bird identification book.  Also an insect identification book.<br/>
<br/>
It makes the world around you so much more interesting when you know just a tad of info about it.<br/>
<br/>
We have loved the barn swallows that build their nests on our patio each Spring.  We have several Black and Yellow Garden Spiders that live out at the barn and I even have a Jumping Spider that lives behind my computer.  The kids name them and we check on everybody ever so often.<br/>

Oh, yes! We have a bird book, software and had a bird feeder...where <br/>
did it go? Dh and ds have enjoyed that, but it had fallen out of my <br/>
brain, I guess. I have thought about getting one of those bird houses <br/>
that you attach to your window so you can watch the birds but they <br/>
can&#39;t see you--one way mirror, I guess.<br/>
<br/>

wanted to look at all the pictures of them in our animal book this <br/>

Cool. I was thinking of big animals and not about birds or bugs. At <br/>
least I know when I need help, lol!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-716960156">We have set up a bird/squirrel sanctuary outside our livingroom  window.  We <br/>
have three bird feeders, 1 suet feeder and a feeder that sits  on the ground <br/>
for squirrels.  We also journal what kind of birds come to  the feeders.  All <br/>
the feeders are filled with a different type of food  which brings in many <br/>
types of birds.  We have found that Bluejays love  whole peanuts in the shell.  It <br/>
has been very fascinating.  Have  fun.<br/>
