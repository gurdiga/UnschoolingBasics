<div id="ygrps-yiv-1037750017">Hi, My name is Alex and I am a SAHM of an almost 31 months old son. I <br/>
have read a little about unschooling and We are already going to <br/>
homeschool. We live in a farm and we have two neighbours that <br/>
homeschool. They are wonderful families. I am thinking that the less <br/>
structured learning is more like our family. We don&#39;t do well with <br/>
RIGID schedules.<br/>
I will probably be lurking more than posting for now. I only have a <br/>
few questions. Anyone in Minnesota? and a list of good books?<br/>
( I know about John Holt but would like other sources just because I <br/>
love to read!)<br/>
Oh and I would love to hear how a regular unschooling day is for <br/>
parents of 2-3 year olds.<br/>

We are in Mn. Near Mankato. Where are you?<br/>
Sorry I can&#39;t answer about a day with a to or three year old might look like as my two year old has 10 older siblings and one younger. I am sure our days are a bit diffrent than at your house.!<br/>

Hi Alex,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Danielle, Unschooling mom to Emily (7), Julia (6) and Sam (4), <br/>
living and learning outside Washington, DC. We&#39;re on our third <br/>
&quot;official&quot; year of Unschooling, and you&#39;re welcome to check out my <br/>
website (url below) to see how we spend our time. My blog, which is <br/>
linked off of that, offers a more day-to-day view of our lives. My kids <br/>
are a bit older than yours, but still on the younger side.<br/>
<br/>
Also, there&#39;s a list that I co-own with Robyn Coburn for Unschooling <br/>
*young* children--under about 8 or so--if you&#39;d like to join it as well <br/>
as here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysUnschooled/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysUnschooled/</a>  If you visit <br/>
the webpage for that group and join, there is a whole database of books <br/>
recommended by those Unschooling young children that you can check out. <br/>
We&#39;ve also recently set up a Book Club where we&#39;ll be discussing one of <br/>
these books a month, which you could either join in or just use it as <br/>
your own personal book review club. *g*<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1822753992">Well, DS is 6 1/2 now but I do remember a little of what the days <br/>
were like when he was 2 and 3 yrs old. They went about like this: DH <br/>
got up, checked email, maybe popped in a movie, etc. I got up and <br/>
headed to work. DS got up somewhere between 7 and 9. They ate <br/>
breakfast, played, watched TV/videos, ate lunch, played, watched <br/>
TV/videos, dishes got done and other assorted house stuff (at the <br/>
time we were in an apartment). Once a week they&#39;d pack up first <br/>
thing and head to MIL&#39;s where they did laundry and hung out for most <br/>
of the day - DS often sampled FIL&#39;s breakfast when they got there - <br/>
he&#39;s tried scrapple and grits and other stuff we never have around <br/>
the house. If it was summer and Friday, they&#39;d head to our hs <br/>
group&#39;s park day around 10. They&#39;d go to the park at random or the <br/>
science center or even just a trip the grocery store was an <br/>
adventure. Now their days are pretty much the same - except DS can <br/>
handle the remote and read the channel guide and the clock to see <br/>
when his favorites are on and their adventures are often further <br/>
afield. They are involved in a co-op once a week (DH leads the chess <br/>
club and DS usually chooses to go to the science club to do <br/>
experiments). The breadth and depth and scope have changed but <br/>
basically life just goes on.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Hi, Alex, I&#39;m sorry to be so late in getting back to you. We&#39;ve all been under the weather lately, and this post got stuck in my &quot;to do&quot; pile.<br/>
<br/>
Kelli Traaseth&#39;s up there somewhere, isn&#39;t she? Bemindji or somewhere? Kelli? but she&#39;s in the middle of moving right now and may be swamped with things other than this list! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Books: John Holt, in order, is a great way to begin. Alfie Kohn&#39;s _Punished by Rewards_, Frank Smith&#39;s _The Book of Learning and Forgetting_, John Taylor Gatto&#39;s _Dumbing Us Down_ and _The Underground History of American Education_, Grace Llewellyn&#39;s _The Teenage Liberation Handbook_, Mary Griffith&#39;s _The Unschooling Handbok_, and our own Valerie Fitzenreiter&#39;s _The Unprocessed Child_. <br/>
<br/>
Joyce Kealoha&#39;s book, _Trust the Children_ might be a good one for those with young-ish children too.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s one more unschooling book coming out later this year that is just AWESOME---but you&#39;ll have to wait for details from the author. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Two-three year olds----well, you might be very interested in another e-list (if someone else hasn&#39;t already mentioned it): <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:AlwaysUnschooled@yahoogroups.com">AlwaysUnschooled@yahoogroups.com</a> for parents of young-ish children who are living the unschooling lifestyle *before* school age.<br/>

&lt;G&gt;.  If I&#39;m right, thanks - if I&#39;m wrong, well, you can all laugh at me<br/>

about it without being prompted!  ~Rue<br/>
