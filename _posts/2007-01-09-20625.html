against a cultural and religious norm and do what you felt  was best for your baby<br/>
 instead. how beautiful!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-713272962">We have 2 whole boys (means not cut�) and we are Jewish too.<br/>
<br/>
There were moments with the first son that we were under pressure from my<br/>
mother in law and others but I see it today as kind of a �test� for how<br/>
strong we are with what we believe and feel.<br/>
<br/>
For me to go against my motherhood feelings was worst then to go not with<br/>
the flow of my culture.<br/>
<br/>
I didn�t do it against anyone; I did it for and pro my feelings and son.<br/>
<br/>
I simply felt that if there something done to my baby and I can not see it<br/>
or feel comfortable with, then it is wrong for me and my baby. That is my<br/>
motherhood instinct.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Only after deciding that out of my intuition I have checked the health<br/>
matter and found that there is no reason also from that point, to<br/>
circumcise.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
In any way I would be cautious with research since so many times they are<br/>
inclined (I hope I choose the right word here for what I mean).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-256895634">I have only one son, and he never was circumcised.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not Jewish, but part of the lack of circumcision has to do with the<br/>
&quot;ignorance is bliss&quot; thing.  I didn&#39;t know anything about it and that it<br/>
was supposed to be an issue when having a baby boy.   I never had to do<br/>
anything special with my girls so the idea that I might have to do<br/>
something special with my boy just never entered my mind.<br/>
<br/>
So, later on, when I discovered the internet and saw all these &quot;Circ vs<br/>
Non Circ&quot; threads, it was a whole learning curve for me... I figured,<br/>
except in extreme medical situations, most people come with the parts<br/>
nature intended, and left it at that.<br/>
