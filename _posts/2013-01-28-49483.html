<div id="ygrps-yiv-912127996">Hello, <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Johanna again from the German magazine &quot;unerzogen&quot; - about Unschooling, respectful parenting and democratic schools. As you might know, homeschooling is forbidden in Germany. Our work is important, and we like to inspire our readers by the more experienced unschooling movements in the US - you guys are ahead of us and many ways. <br/>
<br/>
In the next issue we will focus on single parents raising one or more children. We&#39;d like to publish an article about Unschooling as a single mom or dad, this could focus on the unschooling part of it, or it could be about an alternative approach to parenting when the parents have separated - there are many creative ways, and we expect the unschooling community to be even more creative when finding solutions that fit the unschooling context as well as the needs of the children and maybe even ex-partner. <br/>
<br/>
If any of you feels like this could be your topic, please pop us a note so we can send you more details about how to work with us! It&#39;s also possible to send in proposals that are close to this topic<br/>
<br/>
If you have already published something like that, but it&#39;s only been published in English and not online, it might serve us, too. <br/>
<br/>
Feel free to post this request in other social networks or mailinglists!<br/>
