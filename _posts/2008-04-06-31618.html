<div id="ygrps-yiv-510829078">Just letting you know I&#39;m going &quot;no mail&quot; for awhile with the groups.<br/>
 Probably most of the spring.  spring is REALLY busy and the emails<br/>
really bog me down.  I tend to get sucked right in to the computer!!!  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re headed south on Thursday to Pawley&#39;s Island (feel free to email<br/>
me privately if you&#39;d like to meet somewhere!)  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll see some of you at the Northeast Unschooling Conference.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be back eventually!<br/>
<br/>
Heather</div>
