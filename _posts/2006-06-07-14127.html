If you can&#39;t make it to Albuquerque, for the Live and Learn  <br/>
conference, there is a very unschooling-friendly conference in  <br/>
August, in Sacramento, sponsored by HSC. It includes a very large  <br/>
teen program and most of the teens who participate are unschoolers or  <br/>
very relaxed homeschoolers. Many from your area.<br/>

information.<br/>
