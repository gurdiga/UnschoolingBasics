<div id="ygrps-yiv-1838351554">I am one of those ppl who learns by asking a lot of questions. So here<br/>
goes. I don&#39;t know all of you, only a couple in person. I have been<br/>
looking at a lot of websites and a lot of blogs. One thing that I have<br/>
come across is that most all the little boys have short hair and dress<br/>
in &#39;typical american boy&#39; outfits. Shirts with moving vehicles,<br/>
dinosaurs, tv or movie characters, and camoflage. And the girls mostly<br/>
have longer hair in pretty styles, and wear pastels, flowers, brats<br/>
and barbie. The girls seem to have the most range of wearing<br/>
-alternative-fashions, some different hair color,  Almost exactly like<br/>
a normal cut of the population. <br/>
How is this NOT coersive parenting? I know this is not the<br/>
AlwaysUnschooled yahoo list and maybe it would fit there better<br/>
but...isn&#39;t dictating when they are very young &#39;proper gender roles&#39;<br/>
completely coersive? I know ppl could say, that is what he/she likes<br/>
to wear but isn&#39;t that also what the parent is comfortable with? <br/>
Did you ask him before that *first hair cut* if that is what he<br/>
wanted? Did you ever put him in a dress? And if not, why not?<br/>
Isn&#39;t that letting him be led by what he sees on tv? What he feels<br/>
from the parents is the right answer? Do they get to pick out/purchase<br/>
their own clothes?<br/>
I will share my own experience. I have two older girls, my 7yr old<br/>
dresses like a &#39;typical boy&#39; most days. she has just started wearing<br/>
her hair longer but she has always liked it really short. She wears<br/>
cargo shorts, skateboarding tshirts, and converse allstars. Sometimes<br/>
she will wear dresses for days but it is unusual. For years until she<br/>
was maybe 5 she didn&#39;t wear clothes. I didn&#39;t make her. Now she likes<br/>
to play princess sometimes but most days it is still pirate. Almost<br/>
all of her friends are boys, she climbs trees, skateboards, jumps off<br/>
of higher and higher things. <br/>
Now a lot of ppl think that is okay, &#39;she is just a little girl, she<br/>
is so cute in those boy clothes&#39;. But what about this...<br/>
I also have 2 younger boys. My 3rd child will be 5 in November, we<br/>
took him and the girls to get haircuts when he was about 1. He saw his<br/>
sisters get their hair cut and when it was his turn we put him in the<br/>
chair and he holds onto the back of his neck and starts shaking his<br/>
head. I asked him &quot;what?&quot; and he said &quot;no, my hair&quot; in this really sad<br/>
voice, so the lady said she could just do it anyway. I said no, it is<br/>
his hair and we left. Grandparents tried bribing him, uncles tried<br/>
forcing him, everyone else(except us) tried by making him feel bad<br/>
about himself. My husband and I just decided that it was his hair he<br/>
would cut it when he felt like it. Well...he is 4.5 and his hair is<br/>
down to his WAIST. The prettiest hair you have ever seen. But we live<br/>
in the south and young boys Do Not have long hair. He has been called<br/>
a sissy by adults! We have been told in complete seriousness &quot;you need<br/>
to cut his hair now...or he will start acting like a girl&quot; To be<br/>
honest, I like his hair and I am proud of him,  proud of him for not<br/>
caving when even his little guy friends tell him to cut his hair. <br/>
So even though I may be coersive in other aspects of my<br/>
parenting(working on that) Can we open this discussion? He wears<br/>
dresses too! But it is funny, he has started not wanting to wear<br/>
dresses or pink (it was his favorite color for years) because he says<br/>
it is too girly, but his hair is soooo long. Personally I think it is<br/>
great but man I get a lot of flak. And when ppl say &quot;what a pretty<br/>
little girl&quot; he says &quot;no, sir&quot; if it is a woman and &quot;no, maam&quot; if it<br/>
is a man,(we do not make them talk like that to adults and he came up<br/>
with this on his own) my mother in law thinks it is really rude for<br/>
him to say that but I feel that if I correct the person and say &quot;no it<br/>
is a little boy&quot; and they still say what a pretty girl then they have<br/>
it coming. <br/>
Okay so the question might have gotten lost in all my blah, blah,<br/>
blah.. I think if ppl were really honest with me about this then the<br/>
food issues and the tv issues would be easier for me to deal with. But<br/>
those are for different posts. I will let you guys breathe a bit.</div>

<br/>
Maybe you assumed some of the long haired children on the blogs are<br/>
girls...did you think of that?:) You really don&#39;t know gender from a<br/>
picture at a blog, I think your assumption from a picture is playing<br/>
right into the whole gender role stereotype.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t tell gender from a picture. I can&#39;t tell a girl from a boy in<br/>
real life many times (esp. at the conference unless they&#39;re more in<br/>
line with typical boy/girl looks).<br/>
<br/>
Jalen had very long hair until recently, when he took a buzzer to his<br/>
own head. His long hair lasted until he was 5 years old and he chose<br/>
to cut it himself. Not much coercion there. Yeah, we dressed him in<br/>
typical boy clothes but he&#39;s had girl clothes available and dressed in<br/>
them quite often. In fact, he loves dressing in typical girl clothing<br/>
daily now, but doesn&#39;t want anyone to see him. We figure the reason he<br/>
wants to hide is all the messages he&#39;s gotten from mainstream<br/>
society/tv about what boys &quot;should&quot; wear. Those messages exist. I<br/>
think he&#39;ll find a way to navigate his own desires against those messages.<br/>
<br/>
Every society on the earth has gender roles. It&#39;s part of living in a<br/>
society. So I&#39;m not sure why there is anything coercive about dressing<br/>
kids in what is &quot;traditional&quot; garb for our society. You could say<br/>
we&#39;re &quot;coercive&quot; for not dressing them in other time periods instead<br/>
of modern clothes. People aren&#39;t going to have every option in the<br/>
entire world within their home. But as children explore the world with<br/>
you, it&#39;s important to support their interests and<br/>
fascinations...which include trying on gender roles and various clothing.<br/>
<br/>
Jalen also loves wearing nail polish and putting makeup on us. All of<br/>
that has been fully supported just as it would be with anyone in the<br/>
house...gender has nothing to do with it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure how it&#39;s coercive to not give your kid every clothing<br/>
option under the sun from birth. Not possible. Having various gender<br/>
styles available is great....we can do that! I don&#39;t have 17th and<br/>
18th century costumes avaiable to them, I DO have 15th<br/>
century....coercive? If they became fascinated with a time period and<br/>
wanted costumes, we&#39;d figure out a way. Unschooling doesn&#39;t mean you<br/>
can provide the whole world within your home, it does mean supporting<br/>
them in whatever fascination they have.<br/>
<br/>
Sierra has mostly worn only jeans or shorts for many years now. Just<br/>
recently she&#39;s interested in skirts and dresses again (she&#39;s 9). I<br/>
dressed her in cute little dresses and girly stuff as a baby, I really<br/>
don&#39;t think she cared!  When she let her preference be known, we<br/>
honored that. She&#39;s gone through phases of wanting short or long hair<br/>
and is currently undecided about shaving her hair off. I have a 13<br/>
y.o. boy with fairly long hair and a 16.5 y.o. with a mohawk (see<br/>
conference pics). If a child chooses current gender clothing, that<br/>
isn&#39;t limiting them. In a home where trust is plentiful, they have no<br/>
fear about trying out other gender roles if that fascinates them.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure my 5y.o. will fully explore cross-dressing when he&#39;s a<br/>
bit older and more comfortable ignoring societal messages......maybe<br/>
not.  Either way, we haven&#39;t &quot;coerced&quot; anything by dressing him in<br/>
current fashions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1284527430">I know my boys wear superhero etc shirts because they want to.  I could not pay them to dress up, nor could I when they were younger.  (At the last fashion show with their cousins, Samuel dress up as &quot;ordinary boy.&quot;)  My 3 yo does like pink &quot;light red&quot; but has just switched to light green as his favorite.  His hair is about an inch below his collar.  We do get questions about being a girl.  He likes his hair like that and we cut it when it gets so long he cannot see out of his batman mask.  (At his request.)  I think kids to fall into gender rolls as suits them.  I have tried to give the boys dolls and such, they hit them.  We have tried puppets and stuffed animals and they hit us.  In our case they are conforming to traditional gender roles dispite our efforts and I have decided that in our case it is their choice and society has had little influence.  You might want to ask Meridith as I know Morgan often calls herself a boy and I have not been able to convince my boys she<br/>
 is a girl.  I don&#39;t think she is on this list, but try TNunschoolers.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, first one would have to know if the parents coerce the children<br/>
to adopt a certain style.  There are times when my son looks like the<br/>
average American boy with short hair, a Power Rangers t-shirt and a<br/>
pair of denim shorts.  6 months later (in the dead of winter) you<br/>
might find him with shoulder length hair in the same t-shirt and<br/>
shorts (or perhaps he actually decided to wear sweatpants that day!)<br/>
My girls have also had short hair and long hair.  They&#39;ve been<br/>
everything from their natural dark blonde to red to jet goth black.  I<br/>
don&#39;t dictate how they wear their hair.  That is their doing.<br/>
<br/>
I think that children are influenced some by society, though.  Boys<br/>
see other boys (or male role models - personal or celebrity) with<br/>
short hair and decide to cut their hair.  Girls see other girls (and<br/>
female role models - personal or celebrity) with the latest hairdo and<br/>
decide to grow their hair out (or chop it off).  My son had waist<br/>
length blonde curls until he was 3yo when he decided he wanted short<br/>
hair.  His idea.  We&#39;d never asked him and never thought of it.  His<br/>
father also has waist lenght hair (while his mother has changed her<br/>
hair many times)  Since then he has grown it out several times.  He<br/>
currently is in a &quot;growing out stage&quot; after having it buzz cut for the<br/>
summer because he said his head was too hot.  He has extremely THICK<br/>
hair and usually does this every summer - asking on his own.  I<br/>
actually think if he were a girl he would probably do the same thing.<br/>
And I would help him/her achieve that goal.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen Ren&#39;s beautiful children go from their natural blonde colors<br/>
to every color under the sun and with styles from traditional to &quot;a<br/>
bit out there!&quot;  (There were pics last week from the L&L conference<br/>
with Trevor with long spikey hair which made me have major flash backs<br/>
to college! LOL!)  I don&#39;t believe she has coerced her children into<br/>
coloring their hair with bubblegum pink stripes!  (Although she may<br/>
have influenced them!)  :-D<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-817890915">We&#39;ve dealt with these issues.  I have 3 boys, all with long hair.  None of<br/>
them had haircuts until they were around 3 and started cutting their own<br/>
hair (all of them did this shortly before their 3rd birthdays).  We&#39;ve been<br/>
in the same situation where the boy first wants a haircut at a shop then<br/>
changes his mind so they get down out of the chair, usually with strange<br/>
looks from the haircutter person, who is accustomed to parents making their<br/>
kids get their haircut against their will.  We offer to trim their hair out<br/>
of their eyes when it&#39;s bothering them (as evidenced by constantly pushing<br/>
the hair aside, sighs, puffing consternation, and eye infections), and honor<br/>
their response to the offer.  We honor their requests to go get their hair<br/>
cut professionally when they ask (hardly ever, these days).  I talked to<br/>
them at the beginning of the year about growing out their hair for charity<br/>
and they all thought that was a neat concept, so we&#39;re doing that, but if<br/>
they change their mind, we&#39;ll honor that, too.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re all regularly called &quot;her&quot; and &quot;she&quot; but we don&#39;t correct people<br/>
because we don&#39;t really care about other people&#39;s misperceptions.  They<br/>
either don&#39;t hear the remark or don&#39;t care, because I&#39;ve never heard any of<br/>
them correct anyone about it, even though none of them are shy about<br/>
correcting adults in other ways.  When adults have tried to be coercive,<br/>
shaming, or manipulative with them, I&#39;ve stepped between them and the adult<br/>
to stop the assault and remove the boy from the situation.  I&#39;ve changed the<br/>
subject with my MIL when she speaks to them rudely about their hair or<br/>
clothes (and other things).<br/>
<br/>
As far as clothes, my mother sends them all sorts of costumes, hair things<br/>
(barettes, headbands, etc), and clothes with no eye to gender and they all<br/>
enjoy everything she sends.  I only shop online and they sit with me when<br/>
I&#39;m shopping, picking out what they want.  I don&#39;t knowingly interfere with<br/>
the process, but I&#39;m sure I have all sorts of influence over what they<br/>
choose, if only by the choices I make in my own wardrobe.  Likewise with<br/>
their dad.  I think I point them in the direction of comfortable cottons,<br/>
especially my middle boy, who can&#39;t abide tags or clothes that don&#39;t &quot;feel<br/>
right&quot;.  So yes, I do have an influence, though I try to be conscious of it<br/>
and stick to practical concerns.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s us :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1511123585">Have you not seen photos from the conference???<br/>
<br/>
 There were more long-haired boys there than I could count!<br/>
<br/>
  Both my boys (ten and 18) have long hair, and we live in Columbia, SC. <br/>
Cameron (18) has his pulled back in a pony tail and has facial hair, so <br/>
he usually doesn&#39;t get comments any more. When he was eight with long <br/>
hair and at camp, someone called him a girl. He came home and <br/>
immediately asked for a hair cut. Short and very handsome---but he <br/>
tired of it after a while and let it grow again. It would be past his <br/>
butt now if he hadn&#39;t have cut it way back then.<br/>
<br/>
  Duncan (10) is regularly called a girl---even in &quot;alternative&quot; places <br/>
like Albuquerque last week. But he just smiles and says. &quot;I&#39;m a boy, <br/>
but I get that *all* the time.&quot; &lt;g&gt; Folks generally kindly apologize.<br/>
<br/>
  I would have a problem if either boy were to be rude to someone for <br/>
making a mistake.<br/>

 I am one of those ppl who learns by asking a lot of questions. So here<br/>
 goes. I don&#39;t know all of you, only a couple in person. I have been<br/>
 looking at a lot of websites and a lot of blogs. One thing that I have<br/>
 come across is that most all the little boys have short hair and dress<br/>
 in &#39;typical american boy&#39; outfits. Shirts with moving vehicles,<br/>
 dinosaurs, tv or movie characters, and camoflage. And the girls mostly<br/>
 have longer hair in pretty styles, and wear pastels, flowers, brats<br/>
 and barbie. The girls seem to have the most range of wearing<br/>
 -alternative-fashions, some different hair color, Almost exactly like<br/>
 a normal cut of the population.<br/>
 How is this NOT coersive parenting? I know this is not the<br/>
 AlwaysUnschooled yahoo list and maybe it would fit there better<br/>
 but...isn&#39;t dictating when they are very young &#39;proper gender roles&#39;<br/>
 completely coersive? I know ppl could say, that is what he/she likes<br/>
 to wear but isn&#39;t that also what the parent is comfortable with?<br/>
 Did you ask him before that *first hair cut* if that is what he<br/>
 wanted? Did you ever put him in a dress? And if not, why not?<br/>
 Isn&#39;t that letting him be led by what he sees on tv? What he feels<br/>
 from the parents is the right answer? Do they get to pick out/purchase<br/>
 their own clothes?<br/>
 I will share my own experience. I have two older girls, my 7yr old<br/>
 dresses like a &#39;typical boy&#39; most days. she has just started wearing<br/>
 her hair longer but she has always liked it really short. She wears<br/>
 cargo shorts, skateboarding tshirts, and converse allstars. Sometimes<br/>
 she will wear dresses for days but it is unusual. For years until she<br/>
 was maybe 5 she didn&#39;t wear clothes. I didn&#39;t make her. Now she likes<br/>
 to play princess sometimes but most days it is still pirate. Almost<br/>
 all of her friends are boys, she climbs trees, skateboards, jumps off<br/>
 of higher and higher things.<br/>
 Now a lot of ppl think that is okay, &#39;she is just a little girl, she<br/>
 is so cute in those boy clothes&#39;. But what about this...<br/>
 I also have 2 younger boys. My 3rd child will be 5 in November, we<br/>
 took him and the girls to get haircuts when he was about 1. He saw his<br/>
 sisters get their hair cut and when it was his turn we put him in the<br/>
 chair and he holds onto the back of his neck and starts shaking his<br/>
 head. I asked him &quot;what?&quot; and he said &quot;no, my hair&quot; in this really sad<br/>
 voice, so the lady said she could just do it anyway. I said no, it is<br/>
 his hair and we left. Grandparents tried bribing him, uncles tried<br/>
 forcing him, everyone else(except us) tried by making him feel bad<br/>
 about himself. My husband and I just decided that it was his hair he<br/>
 would cut it when he felt like it. Well...he is 4.5 and his hair is<br/>
 down to his WAIST. The prettiest hair you have ever seen. But we live<br/>
 in the south and young boys Do Not have long hair. He has been called<br/>
 a sissy by adults! We have been told in complete seriousness &quot;you need<br/>
 to cut his hair now...or he will start acting like a girl&quot; To be<br/>
 honest, I like his hair and I am proud of him, proud of him for not<br/>
 caving when even his little guy friends tell him to cut his hair.<br/>
 So even though I may be coersive in other aspects of my<br/>
 parenting(working on that) Can we open this discussion? He wears<br/>
 dresses too! But it is funny, he has started not wanting to wear<br/>
 dresses or pink (it was his favorite color for years) because he says<br/>
 it is too girly, but his hair is soooo long. Personally I think it is<br/>
 great but man I get a lot of flak. And when ppl say &quot;what a pretty<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1055076574">One thing that I have come across is that most all the little boys have short hair and dress in &#39;typical american boy&#39; outfits.<br/>
   <br/>
  You&#39;re assuming that given a choice, all boys would choose to have long hair and wear some non-traditional clothing?  I don&#39;t have any daughters, so I really can&#39;t address that one, but I can talk about my boys and their styles.<br/>
   <br/>
  I have three boys -- 21, 10 & 5.  They&#39;ve always chosen their own styles of hair and dress, in or out of school.  My oldest was sporting razor lines, spikes and long curly rattail at 4yo -- he&#39;s always had his own ideas of how he wants to look.  It&#39;s been skater cuts, military shaves, long wild curly hair, and at the moment, shaved.  He shaves it because his hair is so curly it frizzes at any length shorter than shoulder length and he hates to brush it.  For a time, it neared dreadlocks, but now he works as a cook at a barbeque place and shaved is just easier for him to maintain.<br/>
   <br/>
  My 10 yo has let his hair grow long a few times, but as it gets curlier (the curse of all boys in my family line) with age, he prefers it a bit shorter. He&#39;s been upset to have people mistake him for a girl.  Now, tho, after the conference last week, where most of his friends are boys with long hair, I think he&#39;s reconsidering that.  <br/>
   <br/>
  The 5yo had his hair longer than shoulder length at last winter, asked for it short in the spring and had his most recent haircut in July.  He tends to decide spur-of-the moment and we cut it accordingly.  <br/>
   <br/>
  They all choose their own clothes, and each has his own style.<br/>
   <br/>
  Did you ask him before that *first hair cut* if that is what he<br/>
wanted? Did you ever put him in a dress? And if not, why not?<br/>
Isn&#39;t that letting him be led by what he sees on tv? What he feels<br/>
from the parents is the right answer? Do they get to pick out/purchase<br/>
their own clothes?<br/>
   <br/>
  Yep, we do ask with each haircut.  My boys have never asked to wear a dress, but if they wanted to, they certainly could.  <br/>
<br/>
  For years until she was maybe 5 she didn&#39;t wear clothes. I didn&#39;t make her. Now she likes to play princess sometimes but most days it is still pirate.<br/>
   <br/>
  Sounds like the little girls in our unschooling tribe -- naked or pirates.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Okay so the question might have gotten lost in all my blah, blah,<br/>
blah.. I think if ppl were really honest with me about this then the<br/>
food issues and the tv issues would be easier for me to deal with. But<br/>
those are for different posts. I will let you guys breathe a bit.<br/>
   <br/>
  People here will be honest with you -- have you seen any of the photos from last week&#39;s conference?  An amazing array of hair and clothing styles -- boys & girls.<br/>

for our comfort (heck our pocket book would have been much more<br/>
comfortable had he worn his big sisters&#39; hand me downs LOL!) but for<br/>
society&#39;s.  When Keon was 2 or 3 (he still had long hair at the time)<br/>
he wanted to be Snow White for Hallowe&#39;en.  We were quite concerned.<br/>
Not because our son wanted to wear a red and yellow dress and red<br/>
sparkly shoes, but because we were concerned what the people at the<br/>
place we would trunk-or-treat would say and think.  We were already<br/>
&quot;out there&quot; for being the &quot;weird homeschoolers down the street.&quot;  The<br/>
day before Hallowe&#39;en he decided (on his own with no coercion from us,<br/>
not even an overheard conversation from us) that he wanted to be a<br/>
fire fighter instead.  We were almost relieved.  Again, not because we<br/>
were ashamed of having a son who wanted to dress in &quot;girl&quot; clothes but<br/>
because we were concerned about how society would view him and treat<br/>
him.  He still dresses periodically in his sister&#39;s cast offs although<br/>
he thinks that their heels are silly things to wear.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-616251596">My 4 year old son likes his hair like dadyy&#39;s and love boy&#39;s stuff.<br/>
It has always been HIS choice. He has been picking his stuff since before he was 13 months old.<br/>
And this is a kid that will go out to a park in his PJ&#39;s.<br/>
I do not see it as been coercive.<br/>
There is NO way you can coerce my ds. He ONLY does what he wants and feels right about it&#92;<br/>
He has been like that since birth and I am happy to say we respect it. <br/>
His first hair cut was when he asked for one.<br/>
And we onl;y buy clothes that he wants.<br/>
He likes no pants on. <br/>
So to this day he gets home and takes out his pants and shoes.<br/>
He also stopped wearing underwear a few months ago.<br/>
I was like that and up until I was 16 years old I loved wearing my brothers and father&#39;s clothing. <br/>
Actually I remenber wearing their stuff until much older.....<br/>
Oh yeah I still wear my hubby&#39;s stuff. On the other hand I also love to dress sexy with short short stuff and hi heels.<br/>
Go figure....<br/>

<br/>
  Maybe you assumed some of the long haired children on the blogs are<br/>
  girls...did you think of that?:) You really don&#39;t know gender from a<br/>
  picture at a blog, I think your assumption from a picture is playing<br/>
  right into the whole gender role stereotype.<br/>
<br/>
  I can&#39;t tell gender from a picture. I can&#39;t tell a girl from a boy in<br/>
  real life many times (esp. at the conference unless they&#39;re more in<br/>
  line with typical boy/girl looks).<br/>
<br/>
  Jalen had very long hair until recently, when he took a buzzer to his<br/>
  own head. His long hair lasted until he was 5 years old and he chose<br/>
  to cut it himself. Not much coercion there. Yeah, we dressed him in<br/>
  typical boy clothes but he&#39;s had girl clothes available and dressed in<br/>
  them quite often. In fact, he loves dressing in typical girl clothing<br/>
  daily now, but doesn&#39;t want anyone to see him. We figure the reason he<br/>
  wants to hide is all the messages he&#39;s gotten from mainstream<br/>
  society/tv about what boys &quot;should&quot; wear. Those messages exist. I<br/>
  think he&#39;ll find a way to navigate his own desires against those messages.<br/>
<br/>
  Every society on the earth has gender roles. It&#39;s part of living in a<br/>
  society. So I&#39;m not sure why there is anything coercive about dressing<br/>
  kids in what is &quot;traditional&quot; garb for our society. You could say<br/>
  we&#39;re &quot;coercive&quot; for not dressing them in other time periods instead<br/>
  of modern clothes. People aren&#39;t going to have every option in the<br/>
  entire world within their home. But as children explore the world with<br/>
  you, it&#39;s important to support their interests and<br/>
  fascinations...which include trying on gender roles and various clothing.<br/>
<br/>
  Jalen also loves wearing nail polish and putting makeup on us. All of<br/>
  that has been fully supported just as it would be with anyone in the<br/>
  house...gender has nothing to do with it.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m not sure how it&#39;s coercive to not give your kid every clothing<br/>
  option under the sun from birth. Not possible. Having various gender<br/>
  styles available is great....we can do that! I don&#39;t have 17th and<br/>
  18th century costumes avaiable to them, I DO have 15th<br/>
  century....coercive? If they became fascinated with a time period and<br/>
  wanted costumes, we&#39;d figure out a way. Unschooling doesn&#39;t mean you<br/>
  can provide the whole world within your home, it does mean supporting<br/>
  them in whatever fascination they have.<br/>
<br/>
  Sierra has mostly worn only jeans or shorts for many years now. Just<br/>
  recently she&#39;s interested in skirts and dresses again (she&#39;s 9). I<br/>
  dressed her in cute little dresses and girly stuff as a baby, I really<br/>
  don&#39;t think she cared! When she let her preference be known, we<br/>
  honored that. She&#39;s gone through phases of wanting short or long hair<br/>
  and is currently undecided about shaving her hair off. I have a 13<br/>
  y.o. boy with fairly long hair and a 16.5 y.o. with a mohawk (see<br/>
  conference pics). If a child chooses current gender clothing, that<br/>
  isn&#39;t limiting them. In a home where trust is plentiful, they have no<br/>
  fear about trying out other gender roles if that fascinates them.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m pretty sure my 5y.o. will fully explore cross-dressing when he&#39;s a<br/>
  bit older and more comfortable ignoring societal messages......maybe<br/>
  not. Either way, we haven&#39;t &quot;coerced&quot; anything by dressing him in<br/>
  current fashions.<br/>

    I am one of those ppl who learns by asking a lot of questions. So <br/>
here<br/>
goes. I don&#39;t know all of you, only a couple in person. I have been<br/>
looking at a lot of websites and a lot of blogs. One thing that I have<br/>
come across is that most all the little boys have short hair and dress<br/>
in &#39;typical american boy&#39; outfits. Shirts with moving vehicles,<br/>
dinosaurs, tv or movie characters, and camoflage. And the girls mostly<br/>
have longer hair in pretty styles, and wear pastels, flowers, brats<br/>
and barbie. The girls seem to have the most range of wearing<br/>
-alternative-fashions, some different hair color,  Almost exactly like<br/>
a normal cut of the population.<br/>
How is this NOT coersive parenting? I know this is not the<br/>
AlwaysUnschooled yahoo list and maybe it would fit there better<br/>
but...isn&#39;t dictating when they are very young &#39;proper gender roles&#39;<br/>
completely coersive? I know ppl could say, that is what he/she likes<br/>
to wear but isn&#39;t that also what the parent is comfortable with?<br/>
Did you ask him before that *first hair cut* if that is what he<br/>
wanted? Did you ever put him in a dress? And if not, why not?<br/>
Isn&#39;t that letting him be led by what he sees on tv? What he feels<br/>
from the parents is the right answer? Do they get to pick out/purchase<br/>
their own clothes?<br/>
I will share my own experience. I have two older girls, my 7yr old<br/>
dresses like a &#39;typical boy&#39; most days. she has just started wearing<br/>
her hair longer but she has always liked it really short. She wears<br/>
cargo shorts, skateboarding tshirts, and converse allstars. Sometimes<br/>
she will wear dresses for days but it is unusual. For years until she<br/>
was maybe 5 she didn&#39;t wear clothes. I didn&#39;t make her. Now she likes<br/>
to play princess sometimes but most days it is still pirate. Almost<br/>
all of her friends are boys, she climbs trees, skateboards, jumps off<br/>
of higher and higher things.<br/>
Now a lot of ppl think that is okay, &#39;she is just a little girl, she<br/>
is so cute in those boy clothes&#39;. But what about this...<br/>
I also have 2 younger boys. My 3rd child will be 5 in November, we<br/>
took him and the girls to get haircuts when he was about 1. He saw his<br/>
sisters get their hair cut and when it was his turn we put him in the<br/>
chair and he holds onto the back of his neck and starts shaking his<br/>
head. I asked him &quot;what?&quot; and he said &quot;no, my hair&quot; in this really sad<br/>
voice, so the lady said she could just do it anyway. I said no, it is<br/>
his hair and we left. Grandparents tried bribing him, uncles tried<br/>
forcing him, everyone else(except us) tried by making him feel bad<br/>
about himself. My husband and I just decided that it was his hair he<br/>
would cut it when he felt like it. Well...he is 4.5 and his hair is<br/>
down to his WAIST. The prettiest hair you have ever seen. But we live<br/>
in the south and young boys Do Not have long hair. He has been called<br/>
a sissy by adults! We have been told in complete seriousness &quot;you need<br/>
to cut his hair now...or he will start acting like a girl&quot; To be<br/>
honest, I like his hair and I am proud of him,  proud of him for not<br/>
caving when even his little guy friends tell him to cut his hair.<br/>
So even though I may be coersive in other aspects of my<br/>
parenting(working on that) Can we open this discussion? He wears<br/>
dresses too! But it is funny, he has started not wanting to wear<br/>
dresses or pink (it was his favorite color for years) because he says<br/>
it is too girly, but his hair is soooo long. Personally I think it is<br/>
great but man I get a lot of flak. And when ppl say &quot;what a pretty<br/>
little girl&quot; he says &quot;no, sir&quot; if it is a woman and &quot;no, maam&quot; if it<br/>
is a man,(we do not make them talk like that to adults and he came up<br/>
with this on his own) my mother in law thinks it is really rude for<br/>
him to say that but I feel that if I correct the person and say &quot;no it<br/>
is a little boy&quot; and they still say what a pretty girl then they have<br/>
it coming.<br/>
Okay so the question might have gotten lost in all my blah, blah,<br/>
blah.. I think if ppl were really honest with me about this then the<br/>
food issues and the tv issues would be easier for me to deal with. But<br/>
those are for different posts. I will let you guys breathe a bit.<br/>

Hmmm.  I don&#39;t see coersion here in the way we discuss it.    I don&#39;t think <br/>
&quot;coercion&quot; and &quot;choice&quot; are necessarily opposites.<br/>
 <br/>
When dinner is ready, I call everyone to the table.  The vast majority  of <br/>
the time, everyone sits and eats.  Occasionally, someone just isn&#39;t  hungry or <br/>
they are busy or they want to eat alone.  To force them to eat or  sit there <br/>
would be coercion, but to call out &quot;dinner is ready&quot; is not.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t see it as necessary right now to say &quot;dinner is ready if you choose  <br/>
to eat&quot;.  In some families, that might be appropriate.  But my way is  not <br/>
coercive, just because it isn&#39;t presented as a choice.<br/>
 <br/>
No, I do not think buying my children clothes without their consent is  <br/>
coercive.  I buy them toys and books and DVD&#39;s, some they like and some  they <br/>
don&#39;t.  It is no big deal.  No, I haven&#39;t bought my son a dress,  but I also never <br/>
put out chopsticks when he started feeding himself.  We  naturally do what <br/>
makes sense in our home, our neighborhood, our town, our  culture.  If it doesn&#39;t <br/>
feel right to someone, then we can do something  else.<br/>
 <br/>
I think what is more important is that the child *trusts* (built from  <br/>
experience) that his desires will be honored by the family.  That is what I  <br/>
consider non-coercive.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-793273355">I&#39;m sitting here thinking about the whole gender issue and how most<br/>
parents aren&#39;t even aware enough to give their child a comfortable<br/>
place for trying out gender roles, but how that is NOT my experience<br/>
with the unschooling crowd.<br/>
<br/>
The conference for example, both Cameron Lovejoy and James Coburn wear<br/>
skirts. They&#39;re both straight, both masculine men, but they LIKE<br/>
wearing skirts sometimes. Lotsa unique styles among the kids at the<br/>
conference....some of the wee little girls (including my friend Zibby)<br/>
had buzzed hair. Super short. Same with Mellissa&#39;s sweet Bre. I<br/>
imagine that sometimes the short hair is simple for practical<br/>
reasons...but still.<br/>
<br/>
My 13 y.o. was always assumed a girl when he was little..no matter<br/>
WHAT he was wearing. He had this very feminine face, angelic really,<br/>
with huge eyes and long lashes. His hair was very long and white with<br/>
loopy curls. He was so beautiful. Nobody EVER assumed he was a male.<br/>
He finally got tired of it around 4 or so and asked for a cut.<br/>
He&#39;s now growing it out again.:)<br/>
<br/>
Sierra goes between fashion diva and tree-climbing, gun-slinging,<br/>
jean-wearing tough girl. I think it&#39;s safe to say that my children are<br/>
pretty comfortable trying out lotsa roles to see what fits them<br/>
personally.<br/>
<br/>
I know you&#39;d have a hard time telling gender by looking at a lot of<br/>
the unschoolers at the conference. Wish I had some good photos.<br/>
Quinn&#39;s blog had some good ones with Duncans very long hair, but you<br/>
have to be a myspace member to read her blog. <br/>
<br/>
Anyone that wants to see conference pics can go the flickr account I<br/>
created: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://flickr.com/groups/72039428@N00/">http://flickr.com/groups/72039428@N00/</a><br/>
There are plenty of more typical boy/girl looks, but I DARE you to<br/>
tell male from female based on the pics alone. Chances are, you&#39;d be<br/>
wrong in several cases.:)<br/>

There are teen boys in the dress up room wearing frilly things. There  <br/>
were long haired boys and boys with different colored hair and  <br/>
pierced body parts. More difficult to tell with the girls.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Almost exactly like<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But, even if unschooled kids did stick to their gender&#39;s clothes as  <br/>
mainstream kids do, why do you assume that parents are making them  <br/>
dress that way? Isn&#39;t that like assuming that a woman who stays at  <br/>
home with the kids can&#39;t be a feminist? Maybe you&#39;re projecting onto  <br/>
unschoolers the conservative values of southerners because the  <br/>
outward appearance is similar?<br/>
<br/>
We are genetically preprogrammed to be social creatures. We *want* to  <br/>
fit in with society. Unless a child has strong feelings of wanting  <br/>
something other than convention, I think it&#39;s natural for people  <br/>
(including kids) to get their clues of &quot;how things are done&quot; from  <br/>
others. Not clonish copies but sort  of tribal customs.<br/>
<br/>
Despite how alike certain movements insist boys and girls are, there  <br/>
are differences. Boys tend to be more logic oriented. Girls tend to  <br/>
be more language oriented. Boys tend to rough housing. Girls tend to  <br/>
not-as-rough housing ;-) Boys tend to build towers. Girls tend to  <br/>
build caves. Boys tend towards fighting video games. Girls tend  <br/>
towards social video games. That doesn&#39;t say anything about how an  <br/>
individual boy or girl will be, but taken as a whole boys tend to be  <br/>
more boy-like and girls tend to be more girl-like ;-)<br/>
<br/>
And this is being written by someone who went into engineering and  <br/>
whose daughter liked dinosaurs and trucks rather than Barbies and had  <br/>
never chosen to wear a dress on her own before she was 14. The girls  <br/>
in engineering *were* different than the girls in other majors.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s pure speculation but I think the desire to go against convention  <br/>
or the lack of interest in convention is as genetic as the desire to  <br/>
blend into the tribe. It&#39;s just not as common. (Not counting the  <br/>
people who choose to go against convention as a form of protest.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-127317149">Obviously, I find this an interesting topic...can&#39;t shut up about it!!:)<br/>
<br/>
I think Su has a good point about gender roles and how we respond to<br/>
them. Most families (unlike the ones that are supportive and<br/>
encouraging that we read about here) send so many subtle and blatant<br/>
messages about what is acceptable for boys and girls.<br/>
<br/>
Working in the fashion world, I see a lot of it. Little boys walk up<br/>
to the MAC counter and want to touch or look....&quot;that&#39;s NOT for boys&quot;<br/>
or &quot;That is for GIRLS&quot; in a mean voice. Makes me cringe terribly. I<br/>
try to tactfully say something to counter that ugly message, like<br/>
pointing out that we have a BOY (gasp) working behind the counter, so<br/>
obviously it&#39;s NOT just for girls. ARgh to the tenth power. Or I say<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s really fun to play in colors, isn&#39;t it?&quot; and smile sweetly at<br/>
them. Hopefully they&#39;ll grow up to understand there is nothing wrong<br/>
with them, just their parents!<br/>
<br/>
There are so many messages about gender. I think it&#39;s good to be aware<br/>
of this and try to counter enough of it that our children can be<br/>
comfortable in whatever interests them. I feel sad that Jalen likes to<br/>
hide in order to dress up in girly stuff...but I also know that he has<br/>
to work through these societal messages in his own way. We buffer it<br/>
as much as we can.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-430270221">I&#39;m the mother of 3 boys.  My first son wanted his hair to look like his dad&#39;s <br/>
(who is now balding :) so wear it very short, though he used to have long hair <br/>
back in the day!) <br/>
So, DS7 wears his short, but it grows to shabby proportions and he&#39;s fine with <br/>
that, too.  I ask him once in a while If there&#39;s anything he&#39;d like to do with <br/>
his hair, so he knows the option and the power to make choices about his hair <br/>
is in his hands. He&#39;ll either say, &quot;no, it&#39;s fine&quot; or, &quot;Yeah, let&#39;s cut it <br/>
tomorrow&quot; then if tomorrow comes and he doesn&#39;t want to take the time out of <br/>
his day to cut it, it&#39;s dropped and he knows he can come to me if he <br/>
needs/wants it cut.<br/>
Now with our 2nd son (ds5), he had the MOST BEAUTIFUL long hair until he was <br/>
4+, and on the other token that you mentioned in your post, I think that I <br/>
wanted his hair long more than he did.  But, I did honor the request from him <br/>
one day to shave it off.  I didn&#39;t try to convince him otherwise, I just <br/>
figured he knew best and had his own good reasons for wanting it cut off.  <br/>
Probably because he was tired of people calling him a girl, too! Since then, <br/>
he&#39;d had  mohawk, but that&#39;s grown out, so it&#39;s a very over-grown version of a <br/>
mohawk and he&#39;s just fine with leaving it alone.<br/>
Yes, I&#39;ve dressed my little boys in dresses, but when they are old enough to <br/>
be verbal to say &quot;NO&quot; then I have to respect that, too.<br/>
So, that&#39;s my story, I guess.  <br/>
My guys really don&#39;t care what they wear.  They wear a lot of hand me down <br/>
clothes,and my oldest will wear the same clothes for 3 days in a row, so he <br/>
doesn&#39;t have to re-dress every day.<br/>
They just don&#39;t really care, there isn&#39;t a whole lot of interest or desire in <br/>
them right now to buy their own clothes, so I buy from thrift stores or what I <br/>
can find on clearance at stores.  It just so happens, that in our <br/>
country/culture, boys clothes look like x and girl clothes look like y.<br/>
A sign of the times, I guess?  Wish I could afford to buy from some amazing <br/>
organic sellers (usually from foreign countries) where those &#39;rules&#39; don&#39;t <br/>
apply, just can&#39;t afford those right now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-100703944">&quot;My 4 year old son likes his hair like dadyy&#39;s and love boy&#39;s stuff.<br/>
It has always been HIS choice. He has been picking his stuff since before he was 13 months old.<br/>
And this is a kid that will go out to a park in his PJ&#39;s.<br/>
I do not see it as been coercive.<br/>
There is NO way you can coerce my ds. He ONLY does what he wants and feels right about it&#92;<br/>
He has been like that since birth and I am happy to say we respect it. <br/>
His first hair cut was when he asked for one.<br/>
And we onl;y buy clothes that he wants.<br/>
He likes no pants on. <br/>
So to this day he gets home and takes out his pants and shoes.<br/>
He also stopped wearing underwear a few months ago.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This entire paragraph also describes my 4-year-old son.  :-)  Except that today he is also wearing Chick Flick Cherry OPI polish on his nails (he asked me to apply it for him yesterday).  ;-)<br/>

now it&#39;s starting to be more comfortable for him down in the basement <br/>
playing videogames to have clothing on - it gets kind of cool down <br/>
there (oh, for the record, for anyone who doesn&#39;t already know, the <br/>
basement is a finished game room area with the TV, DVD, cable, PS2, <br/>
air hockey, dart board, mini fridge, one of DS&#39; punching bags, the <br/>
mini trampoline, and a comfy loveseat with some casual throw pillows. <br/>
It also has a closet wherein resides the Lego BrikWars scenarios and <br/>
additional bricks in bins. Just didn&#39;t want anyone thinking he was <br/>
somehow being &#39;banished&#39; to the basement or that we &#39;hid&#39; it to make <br/>
it less accessible and desirable)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2003791170">We did DS&#39; first trim (you mentioned first haircut) before he was a <br/>
year old - his hair was starting to get in his face and being <br/>
annoying. Over the last couple of years, DH let his hair go really <br/>
long (think Santa before he went all white - that&#39;s DH, size, hair, <br/>
beard) because a friend was using him as a model for a sculpture she <br/>
was doing. During that time, DS would ask for haircuts occasionally <br/>
when it got long enough to aggravate him. But he&#39;d specify whether <br/>
he wanted the clippers (longer buzz type cut) or scissors (more of <br/>
the &#39;typical boy cut&#39;). His choice. We&#39;ve even discussed and looked <br/>
up how to do Kool Aid hair coloring - if he wants to try it, we&#39;ll <br/>
do it. As far as clothing, he&#39;s pretty much a shorts or sweatpants <br/>
and t-shirt kid ... which is pretty generic (I work in jeans and <br/>
tshirts just like my predominantly male coworkers). True, we never <br/>
had a kid-size skirt in the house but with an only boy, there really <br/>
was no reason to - he never asked about it, we never went out of our <br/>
way to have one around. I suppose if he wanted one, we would&#39;ve <br/>
worked something out somehow (maybe borrow something from a friend <br/>
or something). Never seemed like it was worth spending money on when <br/>
we could use the money for stuff we knew he would like (Pokemon <br/>
shirts for instance). Right now I&#39;m toying with getting a tattoo so <br/>
DH has been using Sharpie markers to play with colors and patterns <br/>
and locations - and we &quot;decorate&quot; DS if he chooses.<br/>

&gt; I think that is why we initially dressed our son in boy clothing.  <br/>
&gt;Not<br/>
&gt; for our comfort (heck our pocket book would have been much more<br/>
&gt; comfortable had he worn his big sisters&#39; hand me downs LOL!) but &gt;for<br/>
&gt; society&#39;s.  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s another reason for DS&#39; clothing to date (though it is fading) - <br/>
we got TONS of hand me downs from friends with slightly older than DS <br/>
boys - and none from folks with slightly older than DS girls. Made <br/>
financial sense to use what was given for free and spend money on <br/>
other things.<br/>
