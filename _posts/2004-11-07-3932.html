You&#39;re miffed because I didn&#39;t allow WHAT announcement? Your <br/>
announcement came to this list, and I asked for those kind of <br/>
announcements to not come to this list unless absolutely necessary.<br/>
<br/>
If we all started posting about people in dire need in each of our <br/>
regions, we wouldn&#39;t have an unschooling list. This list was created <br/>
for people to talk about unschooling. If it was a family of <br/>
unschoolers, it might be different.<br/>
We can&#39;t possibly respond to every regional dilemna, so please keep <br/>
them at local lists or lists where that kind of post is welcome.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1474530248">Well I didn&#39;t realize the list wasn&#39;t local when I sent the request for<br/>
help. Since I&#39;m an unschooler I thought my request would be welcomed. I was<br/>
wrong.<br/>
