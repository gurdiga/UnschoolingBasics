<div id="ygrps-yiv-1410228170">Hello everyone<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t benn there for a while , but the academic term is over and <br/>
I turn back to you with pleasure and relief (I don&#39;t know many people <br/>
favorable to unschooling ...)<br/>
<br/>
My sisters, in particular, don&#39;t understand what we are doing. I had <br/>
an awful discussion with one of them and my brother-in-law ... I <br/>
didn&#39;t want to convince them, I just wanted them to trust me, to give <br/>
my husband and I some credit about the decisions we take for our own <br/>
family. I thought after that discussion that I should simply tell <br/>
them to get information about unschooling before deciding that I&#39;m <br/>
about to turn my children into criminal or idiots. <br/>
<br/>
I had another discussion, though, which made me think and I would <br/>
like to have your always-appreciated-opinion about it. <br/>
<br/>
I discussed with another sister of mine who told me how worried she <br/>
was about her younger daughter, who is 14. According to my sister, my <br/>
niece only do things when she is obliged to. For instance : she is <br/>
supposed to wash the dishes when she is alone at noon and doesn&#39;t do <br/>
it, doesn&#39;t thank my sister when she washes them for her; the evening <br/>
before, she was talking on the phone and she went on talking even <br/>
though my sister asked her to join them for the evening meal, but <br/>
when my brother-in-law said, very drily &quot;You have 30 seconds&quot;, she <br/>
hang up the phone ... She had troubles at school because she didn&#39;t <br/>
do her homeworks and had an attitude with her teachers;  until my <br/>
sister and her husband decided to punish her for every bad remark on <br/>
her &quot;carnet&quot; by diminishing her pocket-money, etc. <br/>
<br/>
I deeply disagree with the measures and the tone, and the <br/>
whole &quot;repressive&quot; thing. Actually, my sister didn&#39;t really believe <br/>
in it either, she is the more understanding of my three sisters about <br/>
my educational choices, the fact that I still breastfeed my little <br/>
one, that she still sleeps in our room, that I don&#39;t spank my kids, <br/>
etc. (but not the fact that I don&#39;t send them to school ;p).<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that it works : my niece does have better grades, and <br/>
a more appropriate behaviour, etc. <br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t like to give you the wrong feeling about my sister, who is <br/>
a very concerned mother, who deeply love her kids and who would <br/>
protect them over her life ... but she can be hard, sometimes, <br/>
primarily with herself. <br/>
<br/>
My sister doesn&#39;t like being hard with her daughter, but when she <br/>
sees that her behavior has changed, she asks herself if she hasn&#39;t <br/>
been over-protective with her after her father&#39;s suicide. She is <br/>
convinced that over-protecting children is not good for them, that it <br/>
is part of our parenting job to let them have bad experiences, that <br/>
we can&#39;t avoid it and that, if we try to keep them safe at all cost, <br/>
they will turn into &quot;dysfunctional&quot; adults - and she can give me some <br/>
examples which, I have to say, are a bit frightening. We decided, at <br/>
the end of our talk, that kids needed some sort of protection, but <br/>
that, sometimes, parents are protecting themselves more than their <br/>
kids, taking more care of their own fears than of their child <br/>
developmental needs.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, after that discussion I was wondering if I was not too <br/>
perfectionist in keeping my children away from the school experience <br/>
and if I wasn&#39;t &quot;over-protecting&quot; them. I am the one who thinks that <br/>
school isn&#39;t a good environment for kids ... but maybe my kids NEED <br/>
to be away from me and to experiment not-so-good environment to grow <br/>
stronger ? <br/>
<br/>
(As I writing it, I realize that it doesn&#39;t make sense, but I would <br/>
like to read you about this anyway, really). Do you understand what <br/>
my concern is ? Can we put our kids at risk by trying to protect <br/>
them ? <br/>
<br/>
Many thanks for your answers - and, as always, for reading my awkward <br/>
sentences :)<br/>

&gt; them ?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I just had a chance to think about this because it came up during  <br/>
chatting at our local homeschool group&#39;s park day last week, some of  <br/>
the moms wondering whether they were sheltering their children too much.<br/>
<br/>
I thought about it some afterward. One of the concerned moms lives in  <br/>
a home with no television. They raise all their own meat. The family  <br/>
lives on a very modest budget and don&#39;t see movies, go to the mall,  <br/>
things like that. But I thought later about what her kids are _not_  <br/>
sheltered from. They&#39;re not sheltered from the reality of where their  <br/>
food comes from: they raise the turkeys and lambs, see them delivered  <br/>
to the butcher, and eat them out of the freezer all year long.  <br/>
They&#39;re not sheltered from economic reality, as they see their  <br/>
parents making hard choices about finances; the family has been  <br/>
living without hot water for some weeks now while they work on  <br/>
replacing a worn-out hot water heater, for instance. How many kids  <br/>
who are &quot;in the world&quot; more are so in touch with the economic  <br/>
implications of normal crises like that?<br/>
<br/>
The thing this family does is bring the children into all of those  <br/>
decisions, or at least make them visible to the kids. The whole  <br/>
family recently had a discussion about whether to get TV, for  <br/>
instance. You could argue that the discussion was a bit loaded, since  <br/>
all the kids know about TV is what their parents have told them, but  <br/>
they talked very concretely about what they would give up in terms of  <br/>
the money to have TV and the time spent watching, and decided not to  <br/>
get TV at this time.<br/>
<br/>
The kids know that the reason they don&#39;t have hot water right now is  <br/>
because they don&#39;t have the money right now. They expect to have hot  <br/>
water back in the house by fall.<br/>
<br/>
The family lives a certain kind of life. Very different from my  <br/>
family&#39;s, certainly. But both of us share a goal of integrating kids  <br/>
into the economy of the household, not having secrets, letting them  <br/>
see how we live our lives. That&#39;s not sheltered, I don&#39;t think, in  <br/>
the sense that it will leave kids unprepared to cope.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure that exactly speaks to your concern, but it&#39;s what I&#39;ve been  <br/>
thinking about this week.<br/>

she&#39;s a child, had people be thoughtlessly cruel to her bc she&#39;s a <br/>
child, had other children hurt her and her feelings. She&#39;s certainly <br/>
learned from those experiences and one of the things she&#39;s learned <br/>
is that her parents are there to help, if she needs them. She&#39;s <br/>
pretty good at deciding about that &quot;if&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
My stepson has lived in a crummy environment, where shame, guilt and <br/>
outright violence were normal. He&#39;s been in school and seen the <br/>
same. Its made him insecure, not strong. He struggles to believe <br/>
he&#39;s anything other than &quot;the big, dumb bad kid&quot;. Unschooling is <br/>
helping him heal from that, but he&#39;s still pretty tentative and <br/>
fragile in a lot of ways. <br/>

Also, when one of my kids experiences a shy period, or a time without many friends, or a period of latency in learning some topic, I&#39;ve had family members quick to blame it on staying at home.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1412047793">Thank you for your answers, really. <br/>
<br/>
I realised while writing my post that it didn&#39;t really make sense, <br/>
but I don&#39;t like to stay with this ugly doubtful voice whispering <br/>
inside me ... As I have already told you, there are no homeschooling <br/>
people around me, not even talking about &quot;unschooling&quot; people. And my <br/>
family is not very supportive, to say the least. <br/>
<br/>
I thought about all this today and I also realised that my doubts <br/>
fell into the idea of &quot;letting them go to school so they will learn <br/>
what the real life is&quot; which, we know, is not true :) But sometimes, <br/>
how would I say that ... I have the feeling that I ask so much more <br/>
for them than other people I know - I can&#39;t help thinking that I ask <br/>
too much and that there must be something wrong about it.<br/>
<br/>
Again, thanks. Your insight is immensely valuable for me and I am <br/>
terribly frustrated to be so limited in my writing and in the <br/>
contribution I can make. I hope others will go on writing about this <br/>
subject ...<br/>
