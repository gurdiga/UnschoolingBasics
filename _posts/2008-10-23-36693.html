 </span></blockquote>Well my reworking of the story needs to take place in Germany since  <br/>
the one I was supposed to tell takes place there. (Some of the  <br/>
teachers might be using the German aspect of the story.) But I would  <br/>
think the supplies delivered to civilians all over Europe were pretty  <br/>
much the same.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking the details of the Berlin Airlift would have been to  <br/>
specific to that situation but it turned out to be helpful. Now I&#39;ve  <br/>
got a better idea of the whole relief effort.<br/>
<br/>
The contents of the CARE package was helpful too. The specifics  <br/>
helped me picture it better.<br/>
