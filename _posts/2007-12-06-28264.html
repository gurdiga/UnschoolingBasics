 </span></blockquote>Just to share a story on this topic:<br/>
My 10 yo ds and his best homeschool friend have been working very hard at building up their Sims 2 characters lately.  After hours of work, they come running to find me just gushing with joy and excitement as they share with me the following details:<br/>
Son: &quot;Mom!  We  got our relationship up & bought a vibrating bed!&quot;<br/>
Friend: &quot;And then we crawled in and enabled the mojo!&quot;<br/>
Son:  &quot;and then we had Woo -Hoo together!&quot;<br/>
Friend: &quot;Yeah it was so cool!  The lights were flashing!&quot;<br/>
Son: &quot;And we were under the covers and rolling around&quot;<br/>
Friend&quot;It was AWESOME!&quot;  (jumps around in excitement)<br/>
Son: &quot;Did we have sex together??? Is that what Woo-Hoo is??&quot;<br/>
Mom: &quot;That is GREAT! Yes, I am pretty sure Woo-Hoo is sex,  I don&#39;t know what else it could be.&quot;<br/>
Friend/son:  &quot;Cool!!!!&quot;  (run off to do see if they can get their characters to do it again)<br/>
<br/>
I am still giggling about this conversation (to myself of course). If I hadn&#39;t known that they were talking about a video game, I think I would have fallen off my chair because they way they described it to me was as if THEY, themselves, had had woo-hoo, not their characters.   And I was also glad for RU making it possible for me to share in their joy about this instead of getting worried, fearful and uptight.  <br/>
<br/>
Watching these two boys spend hours at this game, it struck me that this video game was an excellent way for boys to &quot;play house&quot;.  They love the woo-hoo option and their household is definitely over-sexed, but they also seem to recognize that fact.  They seem to be pushing the boundaries of what they themselves consider acceptable sexual behavior within the safe confines of the game.  Their characters are married now and there has been a lot of debate about cheating on each other.  And at times, one wants woo-hoo and the other doesn&#39;t and I see them realizing that you can&#39;t just lay in bed and call to your wife as soon as she is off of work.  That just isn&#39;t cool.   And of course, they have to balance work and other needs along with budgeting their money, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I just wanted to share a little exciting woo-hoo tale!<br/>
