Rebecca, <br/>
You said something about being a &quot;closet unschooler&quot;, I suggest you<br/>
try to find some other unschoolers in your area so you don&#39;t feel like<br/>
the only ones that understand natural learning.<br/>
<br/>
Also, Brandi mentioned being a clost unschooler around people that<br/>
don&#39;t get it...but she&#39;s NO closet unschooler.<br/>
She runs an email list for locals here in the Tri-cities (TN) area and<br/>
her list descpription is totally, completely, 100%, authentic, radical<br/>
unschooling!!  When new folks sign on, she usually questions the<br/>
unschooling aspect of things prett quick. I get the feeling she&#39;s<br/>
fairly outspoken in real life too.:)<br/>
<br/>
BUT, a lot of us are quieter around those that don&#39;t understand and<br/>
don&#39;t want to understand. With other homeschoolers, I&#39;m very bold. I<br/>
don&#39;t care what anyone thinks anymore. I&#39;m also fortunate to have had<br/>
several unschooling families surrounding me in real life for the past<br/>
few years. Our closest friends are radical unschoolers....oh yeah, and<br/>
my SISTER too.  Many of them are right here at this list.<br/>
<br/>
What area are you in? Maybe we can help you find some radicals to hang<br/>
out with...it really helps.<br/>
<br/>

We are in Indiana..I found an Indiana Unschoolers List and posted a <br/>
while back but there doesn&#39;t appear to be a lot of activity or anyone <br/>
real close to where we are.  And I guess &quot;closet&quot; depends on who <br/>
we&#39;re &quot;closeted&quot; around.  All of my family and friends know exactly how <br/>
we homeschool...may not know there is a specific term for it. My <br/>
dad &quot;gets it&quot; and we have many, many conversations.  He has taken to <br/>
preaching on homeschooling and discipleship from an interest-led <br/>
perspective - using real book, using real life experiences, sparking an <br/>
interest, etc.  It&#39;s been very exciting for me to have this connection <br/>
with my dad.   So I guess I just feel all closety around the homeschool <br/>
group that we&#39;ve met with (meet monthly with moms and starting a <br/>
monthly get together for the kids - AFTER 1/2:00 so everyone can tidy <br/>
up school).  These moms are really nice and I do think there is one who <br/>
at least takes a more relaxed approach but she keeps shooting me the &quot;I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t say anything here&quot; looks whenever I ask how everyone <br/>
homeschools, what do they do, do they do everything in one big block of <br/>
time or do they break it up into their daily routine, etc.  I need to <br/>
get her alone so we can have a heart to heart.  <br/>
<br/>
We did meet a family at the library a few weeks ago that we&#39;ve been <br/>
getting together with now for 2 weeks and they are great!  She only <br/>
uses something for language arts and math and does &quot;school&quot; in under an <br/>
hour.  So she&#39;s a lot more flexible with her time and we&#39;ve stayed out <br/>
together all day.  Her 2 older girls are exactly the ages of the my <br/>
two.  She asks how we do it and I tell her...just don&#39;t use the term <br/>
unschool.  She&#39;s borrowed my Ruth Beechick books so I am kind of hoping <br/>
(since she was open to it) that she&#39;ll get an idea or two of how to <br/>
break away from the curriculum and see how to use their routine, <br/>
interests and daily life.  When we were together last week she asked if <br/>
we were going to go home and do Allie&#39;s schoolwork...I said that we <br/>
would definitely read (me aloud and Allie practicing her reading)before <br/>
she went to bed but that that WAS our &quot;school&quot;.   <br/>
<br/>
Besides, she&#39;d been playing at the library (reading, computer, theme <br/>
boxes, puzzles) the whole time we&#39;d been there.   Mass amounts of <br/>
learning....right there. <br/>
<br/>
Well, off to church...<br/>

Are you anywhere near Indianapolis? I have a friend who is new to  <br/>
unschooling in Indianapolis and having a heckuva time finding people...because  in <br/>
addition to the unschooling thing, they are also a lesbian family!  One  group <br/>
actually changed on their site from being &quot;inclusive&quot; to &quot;traditional  <br/>
heterosexual family&quot; after they visited!!!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We&#39;re about 2 1/2 to 3 hours from Indy by South Bend and Notre Dame.  <br/>
The closest we&#39;ve found have been about an hour away towards Michigan <br/>
City.<br/>
<br/>
And they actually CHANGED their site like that...well that was a <br/>
pretty rude and not so subtle hint.  I&#39;m having a hard time fitting <br/>
in at moments and we are rather consertative Christiany...just not <br/>
with the way we homeschool.  I can&#39;t even imagine the difficulty they <br/>
are having.<br/>

That is just down-right cruel! Geesh, talk about having an &quot;open&quot; mind.  <br/>
Discrimination just leaves such a sour taste.... I&#39;ve been the brunt of way too  <br/>
much of it. But to blatantly change a group like that is pitiful... My husband  <br/>
was raised by two moms and he&#39;s probably the most sensitive, in-tune with his <br/>
 feminine side guy. AND he was a semi-pro football player. Nothing wrong with <br/>
 him. <br/>
UGH... sorry, that just really fired me up LOL  <br/>
