<div id="ygrps-yiv-844274338"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; What if I did that? Or Dh? What if I got up tomorrow and decided to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>do just what I wanted? No breakfast today kids,no clean clothes<br/>
either. I&#39;m going to enjoy myself,not do anything useful<br/>
whatsoever.Everbody fend for yourself now.BTW, Dh lost his job<br/>
because he&#39;s just doing what is fun now, and we no longer have a<br/>
house or car,or electricity. &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
But this is exactly what all four of us in our family do everyday.  We do<br/>
exactly what we want.<br/>
<br/>
The key is in viewing things that were formerly &quot;have-tos&quot; and chores as<br/>
things that are enjoyable.  I like to cook and clean for my family because I<br/>
enjoying caring for people I love.<br/>
<br/>
I like doing laundry because I like to wear clean clothes.  I like to make<br/>
my bed in the morning because I like to get into a made bed at night.<br/>
<br/>
My house isn&#39;t as clean as it used to be because I don&#39;t care about it being<br/>
as tidy as it once was, and nobody else in our family cares that much about<br/>
it being perfect either.<br/>
<br/>
Just because you&#39;re enjoying yourself doesn&#39;t have to mean that you aren&#39;t<br/>
doing anything useful.  And I hope that everyone in our family is doing what<br/>
they love so that going to work is a joyful choice.  This is why we started<br/>
unschooling in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
Radical unschooling is all about living a joyful life.  The doesn&#39;t mean<br/>
that important things don&#39;t get done, they just get done without the<br/>
feelings of drudgery that some many people attach to them.<br/>
<br/>
Doing everything with joy will help your kids want to do the things most<br/>
parents make their kids do.  What I mean is, most parents coerce kids into<br/>
doing chores, helping out around the house.  In these homes, chores are<br/>
unpleasant tasks that parents make you do because they are important to the<br/>
parents.  In RU homes, household tasks are done by the person who would like<br/>
them done, with joy and with no coercion.  This is not to say that the<br/>
parents do everything, because when you model doing household tasks<br/>
joyfully, others want to get in on the action - the kids do see these things<br/>
as yucky.<br/>
