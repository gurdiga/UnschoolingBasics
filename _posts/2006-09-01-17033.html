Well, you could check out the group I started, LIFE (learning in<br/>
freedom everyday) which is mostly just called Pensacola Unschoolers. :)<br/>
I&#39;m sure Michelle can share the link....it&#39;s more of an eclectic group<br/>
now, only a couple of unschoolers left. But it&#39;s secular in nature and<br/>
folks are pretty open minded.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-706410200">Thanks, Ren! I lived in P&#39;cola when I was a kid & still have family <br/>
