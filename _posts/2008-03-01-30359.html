<div id="ygrps-yiv-265498491">Hi all, I have a question maybe someone on this list can help me  <br/>
with? I subscribed (by check) to Live Free Learn Free last spring and  <br/>
received one paper issue, which I wore thin reading and re-reading  <br/>
and passed along to another friend who is considering opting out of  <br/>
kindergarten (her youngest & my oldest will be 5 this spring).  <br/>
Anyway, I received no further issues and there seems to be no email  <br/>
(I&#39;ve tried two) by which to get in touch with the editor? I heard  <br/>
it&#39;s gone paperless, but all the website talks about is making sure  <br/>
your paypal payment is up to date and you&#39;ll get it -- but I paid by  <br/>
check. Anyway, if anyone can help that&#39;d be great, I am eager to read  <br/>
more issues.<br/>
Thank you<br/>
Elizabeth</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1926946023">Funny you mentioned this.  I was recently thinking about it.  I<br/>
subscribed last September or so and never received anything.  I<br/>
assumed the magazine no longer existed.  The website is now very out<br/>
of date.  I&#39;m pretty sure i did get charged though.  :-(<br/>
