<div id="ygrps-yiv-310790239">Deb R....who is also a regular here, posted this at the<br/>
shinewithunschooling list and I thought you&#39;d all like it. <br/>
<br/>
Lex (new member here) just posted about her ds, and the labels being<br/>
put on him by so called &quot;experts&quot;.<br/>
 I really hope you can find your answers Lex, and then release the<br/>
labels and let him just BE who he is.<br/>
Here&#39;s the post from &quot;Shine&quot;:<br/>
<br/>
I know we&#39;re not focusing on this label or that label but when I was<br/>
reading this article, this paragraph jumped out at me:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Typical modes of assessment in the academic world involve being able<br/>
to repeat small details of abstract processes. This is the most<br/>
difficult way of learning for children with ADHD. There are few<br/>
courses of study in the educational system that reward the startling<br/>
gifts your child has to offer. The good news is that if your child can<br/>
emerge unscathed from his education, he can find his niche in the real<br/>
world that will reward him highly for his ardent curiosity,<br/>
creativity, and ability to solve problems in innovative ways.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Did you catch that in there? &quot;...IF your child can emerge unscathed<br/>
from his education,...&quot; IF?? IF!! Only reinforces the damage the<br/>
traditional &#39;academic world&#39; can do to kids, especially our shiny<br/>
kids. It&#39;s one of those times when my whole self yelled out &quot;Then just<br/>
get them out of there already!&quot; That way they can be &quot;...in the real<br/>
world that will reward him...&quot; Life in the real world free of<br/>
that &#39;academic world&#39; can be so rich yet that same &#39;academic world&#39;<br/>
says it is &quot;essential&quot; so that kids can learn to get along in the real<br/>
world. BAH!<br/>
<br/>

friend&#39;s daughter&#39;s preschool teacher told her, &quot;Your daughter is <br/>
gifted, and you need to deal with that!&quot; I expect that my older son, 4, <br/>
would fit that label as well, and I thought, &quot;Deal with it? What does <br/>
that mean? Is there something I should be doing?&quot; So I got all these <br/>
books on gifted children and gifted preschoolers out of the library, <br/>
and without exception the bulk of each book was about dealing with the <br/>
schools: documenting your young child&#39;s giftedness early so you can <br/>
advocate for services; teaching your child coping mechanisms like how <br/>
to deal with boredom; talking to teachers about how to effectively <br/>
handle the kid in class. Yet not one of the books suggested that the <br/>
best solution might be to keep the kid out of school, though that was <br/>
certainly what I took away from the books!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1307024878">Two great books about homeschooling gifted children are Creative<br/>
Homeschooling for Gifted Children and Gifted Education Comes Home: A Case<br/>
For Self-Directed Homeschooling. Both are by Lisa Rivero.  They helped me a<br/>
great deal and advocate unschooling. <br/>

known we planned to &quot;homeschool&quot; - we weren&#39;t reticent about telling <br/>
people that right from the get-go), said &quot;he&#39;s so smart, you should <br/>
get him tested, I know he would do great in a G&T program&quot; I just <br/>
grinned and said &quot;Why? He&#39;s in a class of his own!&quot; and walked away.<br/>
<br/>
Now, her teenaged DD (who I&#39;ve known since she was 5 months old) is in <br/>
a high pressure private high $chool and wishes she could be <br/>
homeschooled (we&#39;ve discussed it at times when it was just me, her, <br/>
and DS and we got to talking about stuff DS gets to do because he has <br/>
the time and freedom to do it). No way her mom would go for it though -<br/>
 being able to moan and complain about all her DD&#39;s homework and <br/>
activities is her reverse form of bragging.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1467409233">This is just a tidbit from a lengthy article intended to help  <br/>
teachers handle gifted kids in their regular classrooms.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;&gt;Gifted students learn best in a receptive, nonjudgmental, student- <br/>
 </span></blockquote>centered environment that encourages inquiry and independence,  <br/>
includes a wide variety of materials, provides some physical  <br/>
movement, is generally complex, and connects the school experience  <br/>
with the greater world. Although all students might appreciate such  <br/>
an environment, for students who are gifted it is essential that the  <br/>
teacher establish a climate that encourages them to question,  <br/>
exercise independence, and use their creativity in order to be all  <br/>
that they can be.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I can make a good definition of unschooling out of that:<br/>
<br/>
****Unschooling is creating a receptive, nonjudgmental, family- <br/>
centered environment that encourages inquiry and independence,  <br/>
includes a wide variety of materials, provides freedom of physical  <br/>
movement, is generally complex, and all learning takes place in and  <br/>
connects to the real world. Unschooling parents encourage their  <br/>
children to question, exercise independence, and use their creativity  <br/>
to be all that they can be. ****<br/>
<br/>
Rough - but the point is -- that&#39;s a description of the idea learning  <br/>
situation for gifted kids (for ALL kids, it admits). They can&#39;t DO it  <br/>
in schools - they can only give lip service to it and throw a bone to  <br/>
the &quot;gifted&quot; kids for whom regular schooling so VERY obviously  <br/>
inappropriate.<br/>
