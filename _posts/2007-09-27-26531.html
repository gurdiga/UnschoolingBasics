<div id="ygrps-yiv-639111200">Hi.<br/>
My name is Trish and this is my 5th year homeschooling. My kids are <br/>
great and I have been using the WTM approach and Charlotte Mason <br/>
philosophy but am feeling burnt out! I am quite intrigued by the idea <br/>
of unschooling (have read some of John Holt and know people who do <br/>
unschool) and think that it would renew my kids&#39; love of learning. <br/>
(Some subjects they groan at and I just don&#39;t want that for them!) <br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m not ready to fully jump in but I do want to learn more <br/>
about it. I am unschooling in Science and that&#39;s about it...how on <br/>
earth do you unschool in Math and feel confident that they&#39;re learning <br/>
everything? I realize that math is all around us but I guess my <br/>
confidence in my ability to unschool needs to grow a bit! Thanks for <br/>
the floor and I look forward to learning lots from you all!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>By coming to the realization that real learning doesn&#39;t look like  <br/>
school learning. And that school learning looks as it does not  <br/>
because that&#39;s how the best learning looks but because of the  <br/>
compromises schools need to make in order to meet a goal that *isn&#39;t*  <br/>
providing the best learning for each child.<br/>
<br/>
Real learning isn&#39;t linear. It isn&#39;t testable (in the one size fits  <br/>
all school way). It doesn&#39;t cover everything in the traditional way  <br/>
of thinking.<br/>
<br/>
Real learning travels the child&#39;s path of interest, from one bit of  <br/>
information that interests them to the next. Real learning is self  <br/>
testing by how well it works in the situation the child needs it for.  <br/>
Real learning is about understanding enough to make something work.<br/>
<br/>
Schools have different goals than real learning. And that&#39;s important  <br/>
to realize. They weren&#39;t designed to provide the best education for  <br/>
each student. They were designed 100 years ago to cheaply raise the  <br/>
general education level of the masses. Teachers and parents and  <br/>
educators 100 years later *want* schools to be more, want schools to  <br/>
provide what every child needs. But 1) real learning would be too  <br/>
expensive and 2) they don&#39;t trust learning that doesn&#39;t look like  <br/>
school learning because: they&#39;re trapped by never having experienced  <br/>
real learning on the level that unschoolers do, needing to prove  <br/>
learning is taking place (to parents and the state) so need a process  <br/>
that&#39;s testable, needing something that&#39;s &quot;cheap&quot; (for example 30  <br/>
kids and only one adult, one set of information for every child.)<br/>
<br/>
The fact is that learning the way schools teach is really hard. It&#39;s  <br/>
why it takes 12 years!<br/>
<br/>
If kids were taught how to build with Legos the way schools teach  <br/>
everything, they&#39;d first -- before kids had ever seen a Lego or  even  <br/>
had the desire to build with them -- be made to memorize all the  <br/>
colors Legos come in, then the shapes, then ways Legos could be  <br/>
connected, then systematically go through architectural styles (since  <br/>
that would be practical knowledge that could be useful for future  <br/>
careers), engineering principles. Then the kids would be given plans  <br/>
and told to put the Legos together exactly according to the  <br/>
instructions. (Points off for any bricks out of place.) And then the  <br/>
kids who were truly gifted in sucking up this information would be  <br/>
allowed free access to Legos.<br/>
<br/>
When your child was first acquiring language, did you worry that  <br/>
because he wanted to talk about balls and dinosaurs and favorite t- <br/>
shirts that he would never be able to discuss how nuclear fission  <br/>
differs from other forms of radioactive decay?<br/>
<br/>
Think about the non-academic interests he can speak knowledgeably  <br/>
about and how he acquired that knowledge. Did it come from building  <br/>
an abstract foundation of knowledge before beginning to tackle what  <br/>
he was interested in? Or did it come bit by bit picking up more  <br/>
information as he used what little information he had? Basically  <br/>
doing something before he understood it.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s how unschooling works. Kids build up knowledge about what  <br/>
interests them. They have a vested interest in understanding what  <br/>
interests them.<br/>
<br/>
(Unfortunately for new unschooling moms, what interests them usually  <br/>
doesn&#39;t look academic. It looks a lot like playing. (Play is how kids  <br/>
are created to learn!) Learning looks like video games and Harry  <br/>
Potter and making videos and reading and watching TV and playing with  <br/>
friends and pretend and chatting on line.) It&#39;s really only after  <br/>
kids are grown and following their interests into college and jobs  <br/>
that we can see how what they did led to where they got. But the  <br/>
ongoing process doesn&#39;t look at all like school.)<br/>
<br/>
Kids don&#39;t learn to ride bikes by studying the physics of rotation.  <br/>
They learn by getting on and falling until they build up enough  <br/>
understanding to keep it upright. Even once they have it upright,  <br/>
they don&#39;t know everything. They know just enough to do what they  <br/>
want to do. As they want to do more, the acquire more information.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s exactly how real learning works. Math -- real understanding of  <br/>
how numbers work -- comes from using numbers for personally  <br/>
meaningful uses. Games. Video games. Allowance. Art software.  <br/>
Decisions in the store. It takes *way way* fewer hours using math to  <br/>
understand it than in school. Schools present the abstract (which is  <br/>
testable) as a way to get kids to understand the underlying concepts  <br/>
(which is really hard to test). (And schools often fail, ending up  <br/>
with more people with math phobia than proficiency. And though  <br/>
schools take credit for the proficiency, they&#39;re no more responsible  <br/>
for math proficiency than art proficiency. Kids good at math are like  <br/>
kids good at art. But they *are* responsible for kids fearing math  <br/>
and hating art and history and science and reading.)  The way schools  <br/>
teach everything is ass backwards and really hard which is why it  <br/>
takes so much work in schools.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately there isn&#39;t a short cut from believing learning needs  <br/>
to look like school to believing that learning by doing is enough.  <br/>
And some people understand it&#39;s enough but still harbor feelings that  <br/>
it isn&#39;t enough. (The messages we pick up from society are pretty  <br/>
insidious and their roots go deep!) Read about the real learning  <br/>
unschooling kids are doing. Observe real learning in your own kid.  <br/>
(And take off the school glasses when you do it! ;-) Eventually  <br/>
you&#39;ll get it. :-) Read here. Read at:<br/>

More than that. How can *anyone* learn *everything*? &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I&#39;m confident that my chldren will learn everything of importance to <br/>
