<div id="ygrps-yiv-933551433">I have been getting up every morning before my kids awake to read <br/>
these emails mainly for inspiration and/or clarity. I wish I wish I <br/>
was homeschooled growing up. I was pushed, pushed, pushed, and <br/>
pushed some more.  still being pushed occasionally. now I have 3 <br/>
girls and I am trying not to push,(oh, it&#39;s so hard, &quot;a lot of <br/>
times&quot;). <br/>
<br/>
I live in FL. Is there any families in FL and how do you handle the <br/>
state requirements(testing, record keeping,etc.) while unschooling? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-145567498">I think some unschoolers use umbrella schools like Alternative Ed <br/>
Institute (they have a website) where you pay a small fee and send <br/>
in attendance records (an email showing dates) and that&#39;s it. Once <br/>
you are registered with the umbrella, you don&#39;t have to do any of <br/>
the other stuff directly with the school district/state.</div>
