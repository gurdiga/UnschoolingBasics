<div id="ygrps-yiv-366838529">Hi, all! <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
First - THANK you for the replies I have gotten about Laura. I feel HEARD  <br/>
and I needed that. It&#39;s been 1 month today since I&#39;ve seen her, and the  <br/>
responses I got are helping me keep it together and respond to her as I can. So  <br/>
again, a true, deep, heartfelt thanks to all of you - even those that did not  <br/>
reply about my subject specifically, because I get SO much from each issue, each  <br/>
conversation. <br/>
 <br/>
And...there was an AMAZING quote one of you had in a letter to me and I  also <br/>
saw in someone&#39;s sigg. I think...about basically taking the responsibility  <br/>
for being who we are...? Could someone kindly send me that again? I *need* it! <br/>
 <br/>
I have more questions, but right now, I am absorbing my replies and  thinking <br/>
and feeling. I have some stuff happening with Grace and her schooled  friends <br/>
(so that last post about the girls and the camp scenario was SOOOOO  timely!) <br/>
but I&#39;ll get to that as I can. <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks again, all. <br/>
Karen<br/>

Hi  Karen,<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if this was the quote you are referring to or not,  but I  <br/>
put it in my post to you about your situation with  Laura.<br/>
<br/>

release you from the  responsibility of making yourself over into what  <br/>
you ought to  be.&quot;  by Ashley Montagu<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
YES! Kendrah, you go it! I THOUGHT it was you, lol! And for that matter I  <br/>
was sure I had saved your reply to me! <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks again!! <br/>
