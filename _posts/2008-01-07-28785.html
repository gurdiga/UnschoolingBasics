<div id="ygrps-yiv-247455444">CarenI loved this! And we have a little &#39;resource room&#39; of officially educational stuff (our craft supplies are in there too) which we haven&#39;t touxched in years but now I see I have thought they were somehow too valuable-looking to throw out. Thanks for your encouragement--out they go!! They did serve a purpose, though. Clear proof of our solid efforts down a pathway that did not work and does not need to be revisited. Thanks for that last comment to &quot;burn everything &#39;educational&#39; in our home!! Cameron<br/>
