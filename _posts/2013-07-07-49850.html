<div id="ygrps-yiv-2050174050"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It&#39;s not more effort to cook differently for everyone<br/>
 </span></blockquote>in the family, but it&#39;s a different kind of logistical puzzle than what most<br/>
moms are raised to. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I would like some tips on how to cook differently for everyone in the family. I looked at this link for ideas: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/eating/dinner">http://sandradodd.com/eating/dinner</a><br/>
<br/>
My kids are still very young (two children under 5), so I still need to *be present* with them a lot. If I&#39;m not present, they&#39;ll end up fighting while I cook--or even while preparing a monkey platter. <br/>
<br/>
Can you please share your experience cooking something for everyone when the children were little? Thanks!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2034392737">As much as possible, bring food prep where your kids are. It could help to re-arrange the home so that more of what the kids like to do is close to where you&#39;re preparing food. It could help to plan messy kid-activities for times when you&#39;re going to be doing messy food things, so you can all be making a mess in the kitchen together (and then clean up one big mess rather than several messes). It could also help to involve kids more with food prep, if they&#39;re interested. Some kids loooooove to help with food. <br/>
<br/>
It can also help to relax into some prepared foods. I don&#39;t know how much time you spend on cooking - there have been times in the past when I liked to do a lot of things from scratch and I found that I also got my ego tied up in that to an extent, so that when I wasn&#39;t really Wanting to cook so much I still felt like I Should. It took an effort to get past that feeling that I wasn&#39;t as good a mom if I wasn&#39;t cooking from scratch. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>*************<br/>
<br/>
Can you prepare foods While they&#39;re eating? That means getting at least one meal/snack ahead of their hunger. The advantage of having food ready before people are hungry is they&#39;re more likely to make thoughtful food decisions - it&#39;s hard to be thoughtful when you&#39;re ravenous! So getting ahead helps in that regard, too. <br/>
<br/>
It can also help to slim down other household tasks as much as you can - such as dishwashing. That might involve using some disposable plates and utensils, or cutting down on the number of dishes so you&#39;re never overwhelmed with dishwashing... or alternately getting even More dishes so you always have the dishwasher running And still have clean dishes.  <br/>
