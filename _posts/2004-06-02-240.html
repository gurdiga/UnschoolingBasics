<div id="ygrps-yiv-2036958644">&lt;&lt;Is child led learning the same as unschooling?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
From my stand point, there are probably as many opinions on this as <br/>
there are people.  I&#39;ll leave it for someone else.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If I am trying to following my toddler&#39;s interests is that <br/>
unschooling?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
From what I have learned so far, I would say, &quot;Yes.&quot;  That is the <br/>
basic concept behind unschooling.  Allowing your children to FREELY <br/>
explore their interests and gently encouraging them without forcing <br/>
or pusing is unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Even though our son is too young for school, I did attend <br/>
school,should I then deschool myself?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, for sure.  I read a couple of books so far that you may be <br/>
interested in that would help this area.  One is &quot;Homeschooling Our <br/>
Children, Unschooling Ourselves&quot; and &quot;The Teenage Liberation <br/>
Handbook.&quot;  Both of theses are great.  The second book can be read in <br/>
any order after you get past the introductory part.  Just look up the <br/>
chapters and see what you want to know.  I also like to go through <br/>
and read the quotes at the beginning of each chapter.  Another good <br/>
book that helps to stir creative thinking is &quot;Unjobbing, The Adult <br/>
Liberation Handbook.&quot;  I know there&#39;s more, but those were my <br/>
favorite so far.<br/>
<br/>
Take care - Tina</div>

Hi  everybody . I have a few questions.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
I saved this to answer later----and now it&#39;s later. Sorry! <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Is child  led learning the same as  unschooling? &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Depends on your definition of &quot;child-led learning&quot;.  To some people  that <br/>
means: if the child wants to do his math workbooks on the porch or in the  <br/>
hammock as opposed to at the kitchen table. Or if the child wants to learn  Egyptian <br/>
rather than Greek history this year.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
THAT wouldn&#39;t be the same as unschooling to me.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
More like un-preschooling? &lt;g&gt; A toddler wouldn&#39;t be in school, so  there&#39;s <br/>
no need to unschool. But yes, following his interests is unschooling.  Letting <br/>
him choose. Trusting him. Respecting what he finds glorious and  fascinating, <br/>
even if you don&#39;t.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
You betcha! Rule of thumb is you need one month of deschooling for every  <br/>
year you were in school----and you&#39;re not allowed to start counting until AFTER  <br/>
you&#39;ve quit nagging/doubting! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s really much harder to deschool ourselves. We can get so wrapped up in  <br/>
society&#39;s expectations. Hard to let go of that brainwashing! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
