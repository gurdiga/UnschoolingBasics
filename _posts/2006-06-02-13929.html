<div id="ygrps-yiv-814890867">&quot; maybe think we&#39;re all a<br/>
bunch of nutcases, and, maybe they&#39;re right.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been called worse.;)<br/>
<br/>
One of the sweet teens that attended the conference for the first time<br/>
confided in his Mum....he said something like &quot;I thought it would just<br/>
be a bunch of weird people. I found out that weird people are really fun.&quot;<br/>
HA!!<br/>
So he still thought it was full of weirdos, he just decided that<br/>
weirdos were interesting and cool to hang with. Too funny.<br/>
