<div id="ygrps-yiv-1210964731">Hello I am new here.. My name is Robyn and I am seriously considering<br/>
unschooling my oldest child, Nate.  I do have 3 children but wanted to<br/>
try unschooling with my oldest first.  <br/>
<br/>
Nate is a beautiful child.. He is so loving and caring.  Nate is also<br/>
Bipolar and has Asperger&#39;s along with ADD/ADHD and Anxiety.  This has<br/>
made school difficult.  His social skills are very delayed.  He is<br/>
socially 5 or 6 years old.  Emotionally is about the same as well..<br/>
Nate is 11 years old.<br/>
<br/>
He is very intelligent and has an awesome visual memory.  He hasnt<br/>
been able to grasp abstract or metophoric thinking yet.. He doesnt<br/>
understand humor and uses words improperly when trying to hold<br/>
conversations.<br/>
<br/>
This school year has been a huge disappointment.. Not in my Nate but<br/>
in the school he goes to.  He has maintained a D/U average all year. <br/>
The school doesn&#39;t even care atleast not in my opinion.  They are just<br/>
happy he isnt disrupting the classroom with crying, biting himself or<br/>
the such.  It doesn&#39;t matter that he has failed everything.<br/>
<br/>
As a result, I have decided it would be best if I taught him myself. <br/>
This way I can give him tons of one on one learning.  I can provide<br/>
him with a learning experience that would benefit him the most.  I am<br/>
thinking alot of visual learning.  Maybe with the use of alot of<br/>
videos and pictures.  Also alot of hands on training.. <br/>
<br/>
I am hoping to learn as much as I can and get as much help as I can to<br/>
make this experience a successful one for both Nate and myself.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1645794961">Hi Robyn. Have you checked out any of the informational sites on <br/>
unschooling? Here are some places to start:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://organiclearning.org/">http://organiclearning.org/</a><br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschooling">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a><br/>
<br/>
there are lots of links at both to other unschooling sites, message <br/>
boards and blogs.<br/>
<br/>
I also recommend this essay by Anne Ohman<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.livingjoyfully.ca/anneo/I_Am_What_I_Am.htm">http://www.livingjoyfully.ca/anneo/I_Am_What_I_Am.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
Its a good look at the kind of mental shift involved in unschooling an <br/>
atypical kid - or any kid, really. Its a fabulous essay on many <br/>
levels. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-779224470">Hi Robyn.<br/>
<br/>
Your post hit me right in the heart because my son, now 12, also has <br/>
Asperger&#39;s (very mild form), OCD, and HAD anxiety issues, and when <br/>
he was in school he was so miserable it got to the point where he <br/>
was suicidal.  (I emphasized he &quot;had&quot; anxiety because as soon as I <br/>
pulled him out of school his anxiety diminished, then disappeared <br/>
altogether.)  My DS had such a difficult time socially, it broke my <br/>
heart.  He just did not fit in socially, but he is very, very <br/>
bright, more mature in many ways than his peers.  Socially, he gets <br/>
along better with kids that are either older or younger than he is, <br/>
and to be holed up in a classroom with kids his own age all day <br/>
every day who just did not &quot;get&quot; him was a nightmare for him. We <br/>
pulled him out of school in the 5th grade (1.5 years ago), tried <br/>
homeschooling for a while, but that didn&#39;t work, and we are now <br/>
pretty much radical unschoolers and I have never seen him happier.  <br/>
He&#39;s still in the DEschooling process, healing the wounds inflicted <br/>
while in school, but he is SO much better off.  I have no doubts <br/>
that pulling him from the PS system was the best thing for him, and <br/>
I only regret that I didn&#39;t do it sooner.  A child that <br/>
is &quot;different&quot;, as yours and mine are, need to be sheltered from the <br/>
cruelties that go on in schools, and they need to be with someone <br/>
who understands their way of thinking, and supported and loved in <br/>
every way possible.  So take it or leave it, but my advice, which <br/>
comes straight from my heart, is to please remove your son from <br/>
school before even more damage is done.  (Can you tell I feel <br/>
incredibly strong about this?)  =)<br/>
<br/>
With joy,<br/>

Robyn, I just sent your SOS membership confirmation and will get the <br/>
cards and letter to you in tomorrow&#39;s mail (Robyn lives in SC). We have <br/>
ANOTHER Robin Bentley on this list---a long-time unschooler---who can <br/>
answer some of your questions. It&#39;ll be like one letter (i-y) from <br/>
talking to yourself! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to suggest that you look into another e-list as well---it&#39;s a <br/>
*very* busy one---called SHINEwithUnschooling@yahoo..... There are many <br/>
parents of aspie/highly sensitive kids on that list. It was originally <br/>
formed for that purpose but has morphed into *all* unschoolers. But it <br/>
has a lot of aspie/sensitive talk on it. We&#39;d like to keep you *here* <br/>
too, but I think they would have a lot to share with you there as well.<br/>
<br/>
My youngest is 11 too. Let me know whenever you&#39;re in the Columbia area!<br/>
<br/>
Consider the Live and Learn Unschooling Conference in Asheville, NC <br/>
this September. 700 or so unschoolers in one place! Magical!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In Even Cowgirls Get the Blues, Tom Robbins writes something like,  <br/>
&quot;In fact, it&#39;s possible to make too much of success. Success closes  <br/>
off as many options as failure.&quot; And it&#39;s really true! That has  <br/>
stayed with me for more than 20 years since I read that book.<br/>
<br/>
Some examples include, when a relationship of mine failed, my partner  <br/>
realized it was an opportunity to do something he couldn&#39;t have done  <br/>
if he stayed with me: move to San Francisco for awhile (we&#39;re still  <br/>
best friends 16 years later, so it wasn&#39;t a total failure).<br/>
<br/>
And I just spent a Sunday with an old friend from high school and  <br/>
college. She and her husband both finished college in 4 years and got  <br/>
Ph. D.s in another four. He&#39;s a nuclear physicist, which pays quite  <br/>
well, but there aren&#39;t a whole lot of things you can do with a degree  <br/>
in nuclear physics. He has never had a job he enjoyed or that didn&#39;t  <br/>
take him away from his family more than they wanted, in the sixteen  <br/>
years since they got their degrees. My friend said, &quot;We basically  <br/>
live for vacations now, and we&#39;ve decided to make early retirement a  <br/>
goal, so we&#39;re saving a lot.&quot; In her own words, it&#39;s sad.<br/>
<br/>
Heck, she even sometimes questions whether the success of their  <br/>
relationship has limited them. They met our first night in the dorm,  <br/>
were each other&#39;s first boyfriend and girlfriend at age 17, and have  <br/>
been together ever since. They&#39;re very happily married but neither of  <br/>
them has ever been single and independent, or so much as kissed  <br/>
another person.<br/>
<br/>
And for me: I thought about doing a EurailPass around Europe after I  <br/>
graduated from college. But I got a big fellowship to grad school and  <br/>
didn&#39;t do it. Grad school sucked. I&#39;d probably have been really  <br/>
disappointed not to get into grad school, but in the long run I&#39;d  <br/>
probably have happier memories of a summer in Europe than I do of my  <br/>
first attempt at grad school!<br/>

The SHINE list is a source of inspiration for me.  My daughter (12) is a<br/>
shine-y soul, whose life would be miserable in school (or with any kind of<br/>
coerced learning).  I learned early on that not only was that kind of thing<br/>
wrong for her, it was wrong for me, too.  The folks on SHINE,<br/>
UnschoolingDiscussion, AlwaysLearning (and some particularly wise women on<br/>
the first homeschooling list I joined in Canada) continue to confirm and<br/>
encourage my belief that it is my *relationship* with my child that counts<br/>
the most.  I don&#39;t want to do anything that gets in the way of that.<br/>
<br/>
***<br/>
<br/>
Consider the Live and Learn Unschooling Conference in Asheville, NC <br/>
this September. 700 or so unschoolers in one place! Magical!<br/>
<br/>
***<br/>
<br/>
Yes, yes, yes!  If there is any place that a shine-y kid can blossom, be<br/>
accepted as they are by adults and kids alike, it&#39;s at an unschooling<br/>
conference.  And *you* will get plenty of support IRL for following this<br/>
path with your son (and your other children, too).<br/>
<br/>
You may find that your son&#39;s anxiety diminishes, as his social skills and<br/>
learning unfold on *his* schedule.  Honoring his timetable though<br/>
unschooling can only help.<br/>
<br/>
So, ask away on any or all lists you join.  Many, many astute unschoolers<br/>
will be happy to help and/or challenge your thinking.  And welcome to this<br/>
great life.<br/>

 </span></blockquote> Hi Robyn<br/>
I took my beautiful, talented 14yo dd out of school this past <br/>
February after a team meeting at the school where I was told by <br/>
7 &quot;professionals&quot; that I was setting my daughter up for failure.  <br/>
They felt she couldn&#39;t be successful in PS and I should let her be <br/>
assessed to put in an alternative program for high school.  My girl <br/>
has struggled with anxiety issues throughout school and middle <br/>
school became a nightmare.  She was threatened & bullied, she gained <br/>
40lbs and started failing all her classes.  What I told the experts <br/>
that day was there is no shame in failing, at least it means you <br/>
tried.  I believe every experience in life is positive as long as <br/>
you learned from it.  I only regret that I didn&#39;t have the courage <br/>
sooner to take her out of school.  Three  months later dd has chosen <br/>
to become a vegetarian & has started swimming, playing Dance Dance <br/>
Revolution and walking.  She has started to lose some weight but <br/>
more importantly she holds her head up more and her eyes are <br/>
bright.  She is happier and healthier.  That&#39;s enough for me.  I <br/>
have faith in her to find her own way and I will help her as much as <br/>
she needs me to.  <br/>

Sorry. SOS is short for School&#39;s Out Support, a statewide support group <br/>
for unschoolers in SC. It&#39;s also become an accountability association <br/>
for homeshcoolers in SC this year. It also was the fisrt host of the <br/>
Live and Learn Unschooling Conference in 2001.<br/>

  1. there is no way it will be financially possible this year <br/>
   <br/>
  2. i have a severly autistic 5 year old . He runs away if I let go of him for a second, he screams what seems like constantly , i feel like he would disturb everyone way to much if I tried to take him in with me to listen to anyone speak. Even if I choose to just go up there and hang out with everyone but not listen to anyone speak im just not sure Id be comfortable driving that far with 3 kids under 8 . Dh just started this job and wouldnt be able to get the time off. I havent been able to find anyone willing to watch him for a few hours much less a few days and he really needs to be with mom anyway. <br/>
  Dh isnt nearly as into unschooling as i am ( thats a whole nother post) so even if there was a way we could afford it talking him into spending the money would be difficult.<br/>
   <br/>
  3. Despite all that I still Really want to go so im going to just cry now :(<br/>

Unschooling conferences are sooo different. That&#39;s &quot;normal&quot; behavior at <br/>
  an unschooling conference---or at least, not ABnormal! &lt;G&gt; Each child <br/>
is an individual and isn&#39;t expected to be &quot;adult-like&quot; for several more <br/>
years! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

i wanted to second what Kelly is saying about autistic behavior. Last year was our first <br/>
conference, and I was still very tender about how my autistic child would be received. Most <br/>
likely I was scared to get the same condemnation I get daily as I go to the store or mall or <br/>
park, etc (I know you know what I mean) I asked online if anyone wanted information and <br/>
got the same response. I didn&#39;t quite trust it, and tried to be open at the conference but <br/>
was really still scared of getting hurt, or Bre getting hurt, emotionally. <br/>
<br/>
However it was AMAZING. It was so cool to have people who&#39;ve  never met her be so open <br/>
and able to communicate with her as she is, without expecting her to be something she&#39;s <br/>
not.   She had a GREAT time, lots of fun, really bloomed and did a lot of neat stuff. She still <br/>
talks about it (in her own little ways) and is excited about this years conference. Of course, <br/>
she doesn&#39;t understand it won&#39;t be at the same place, but I know that when we get there <br/>
we&#39;ll do great. When she started stimming once, I&#39;ll never forget this, a child of about six <br/>
or so started doing it with her, stopped and said, &quot;Yeah, i see it&quot; and walked off. Too cool. <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t live your life in fear of autism world. Your kiddo will continue to grow and be <br/>
amazing, and I&#39;ll bet that with some preparation you could really do great at the RE <br/>
conference. They still have scholarships too, if you called who knows what you could get.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1906226347">Hi Nicole,<br/>
<br/>
I am also North Dallas, not as north as you. *waves*<br/>
<br/>
I would love to find an unschooling local support group as well. (hint hint)<br/>
I have not made the plunge yet, but I am leaning that direction and find the<br/>
support and knowledge on this board indispensable.<br/>
<br/>
I have only been homeschooling for two years and can see that my children<br/>
learn so much more when I just shut up and let their interests guide them.<br/>
It&#39;s funny how that works.<br/>
<br/>
I am glad to know that I am not crazy. My homeschool support group is<br/>
amazing, but I don&#39;t see any other unschoolers. I want to be able to talk to<br/>
people who understand what it is that I am *trying* to do when it gets<br/>
difficult and I want to throw in the towel and break out the workbooks.<br/>
Guess this turned into my introduction to the group. :-)<br/>

  &lt;bhg&gt; really ! ??....plano?richardson? mckinney?......Im in Sherman so its really not 80 miles its 58 from the begining of hwy 75north :) <br/>

   <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  This makes me think of a very short lived conversation i had earlier today.<br/>
  me: i just found out they are having a rethinking education conference in dallas ..its an unschooling conference..insert definition <br/>
  friend( who is highly supportive of homeschooling but stuck on school in a box) : yes! they need to rething education ....throw out the horrible curriculum they have here and get a better one and move to schooling year round for all these working parents. <br/>
  I wont bore you with anymore ..it ended with me wanting to stab an eyeball. :)<br/>
   <br/>
  But I think often unschoolers dont make themselves know because there will be few that &quot;get them&quot; and many against them ...or the idea at least. <br/>
   <br/>
  I  have a LOT of trouble not becoming frustrated and being harsh with my kids and I too sometimes want to just break out the workbooks ....usualy short lived because not doing workbooks is so much more fun :). I certainly wont try to tell you workbooks and more structure will fix things though :) <br/>
   <br/>
  Welcome to the group! <br/>
