<div id="ygrps-yiv-1440757931">&quot; I apologise if my emotional<br/>
response offended anyone.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
No offense taken whatsoever!:)<br/>
It&#39;s easy to feel defensive about that which is dearest to our <br/>
hearts, our children and our parenting. Believe me, I&#39;ve walked away <br/>
from email lists in the past muttering violently under my breath!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen lists explode many, many times when list members start <br/>
talking about people rather than ideas. It&#39;s a good reminder for all <br/>
of us, to stick to discussing philosophies and ideas rather than a <br/>
specific person.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for understanding....it will just keep the list from getting <br/>
ugly and losing the sparkliness of all the fabulous dialogue we&#39;ve <br/>
been having.:) <br/>
