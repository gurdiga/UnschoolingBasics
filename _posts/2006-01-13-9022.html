<div id="ygrps-yiv-1677814504">School collectivists may look back on Friday, January <br/>
13, 2006 as  &quot;Black Friday.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
20/20 is planning to run a one-hour special featuring  <br/>
John Stossel. He interviews government officials, union <br/>
leaders, parents  and students and makes suggestions <br/>
about how the system can be improved  (w/o, I fear, <br/>
even honorable mention for the only real solution, <br/>
ending  government involvement in education attendance, <br/>
content, financing, and  regulation).<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Stupid In America: How We Are Cheating Our Kids&quot; with  <br/>
John Stossel airs Jan. 13 (10 to 11 p.m. ET) on ABC. <br/>
See below how to  order a copy or transcript.<br/>
<br/>
In the words of E Ray Moore, good friend and  president <br/>
of Exodus Mandate:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Now Stossel and 20/20 are set to  puncture the last <br/>
myth of complacent suburban parents who delude themselves  <br/>
by thinking that, whatever problems there may be elsewhere, <br/>
their  schools are &quot;different.&quot; As Stossel and 20/20 <br/>
point out, not only do our  12th graders do worse in <br/>
math and science, for example, than students in  almost <br/>
all other industrialized countries, the longer our <br/>
students are  in public schools, the worse they do in <br/>
relation to their international  peers.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
While I hate to quibble with my friend Rev. Ray, I <br/>
suspect  it&#39;s NOT the last myth. The &quot;public school&quot; <br/>
establishment is certainly adept  at making up new myths <br/>
when the public sniffs the rat in the current myth  <br/>
du jour.<br/>
<br/>
The special is set to run Friday night at 10pm Eastern,  <br/>
9pm Central, and again at 10pm Mountain, then Pacific, <br/>
Alaska, and  Hawaii.<br/>
<br/>
The Alliance is hosting two teleconferences on Friday  <br/>
night.... open to all our Signatories of the Proclamation.... <br/>
and the  public! <br/>
<br/>
That means you are welcome to forward this to your <br/>
own email  list .... or even your pesky brother-in-law <br/>
who thinks things are just ducky  in HIS local school.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s how you connect:<br/>
<br/>
FIRST  TELECONFERNCE-----<br/>
<br/>
This will be held 15 minutes after the show airs in  <br/>
Eastern and Central time zones:<br/>
<br/>
11:15pm Eastern.......10:15pm  Central<br/>
<br/>
Mountain and West Coast people are welcome to come <br/>
on and get  a preview, if you will, from the reactions <br/>
of those who have already seen  it.<br/>
<br/>
9:15pm Mountain....... 8:15pm Pacific.<br/>
<br/>
Alaska and Hawaii  folks.... and even those in Europe <br/>
who want to get up in the middle of the  night....are <br/>
welcome, too. But you gotta figure out the time for  <br/>
yourself. :-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
SECOND TELECONFERENCE-----<br/>
<br/>
A second  teleconference will be held three hours later: <br/>
15 minutes after 20/20 airs  on the West Coast:<br/>
<br/>
11:15pm Pacific<br/>
which is 12:15am  (Sat) Mountain<br/>
and 1:15am Central, 2:15am Eastern<br/>
<br/>
We may  get some Brits on the second teleconference, <br/>
as it will be 7:15am Saturday  morning in England.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In fact, I was on the phone for an hour this  morning <br/>
with James Stanfield at the E G West Centre in England  <br/>
discussing the show. James Tooley, Director of the <br/>
centre (who will  receive the Alexis de Tocqueville <br/>
Award at SepCon2007, May 4-6, Dallas, was  just back <br/>
from India and his sleep pattern may have him fit to <br/>
join us.  <br/>
<br/>
HOW YOU DIAL THE TELECONFERENCE-----<br/>
<br/>
Using your cell or regular  telephone, from your own <br/>
easy chair at home---or driving down the  highway---- <br/>
dial this number at the appointed hour in your time <br/>
zone  above:<br/>
<br/>
1 (319) 632-1100   pass code 682-129 #<br/>
<br/>
If you  have a noisy background, just press 6 to mute <br/>
yourself. When you want to say  something, press 6 again <br/>
to un-mute.<br/>
<br/>
MISCLANEOUS  STUFF-----<br/>
<br/>
John Stossel is apparently quite active in his blog <br/>
and  frequently responds to emails.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to sound off with praise or a  suggestion <br/>
about a future education special, or both, you can <br/>
do so  here: &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://forums.go.com/abcnews/2020/thread?threadID=284154">http://forums.go.com/abcnews/2020/thread?threadID=284154</a>&gt;  <br/>

Earlier, he wrote &quot;If you would  like to purchase a <br/>
tape or dvd, dial 800-505-6139; for a transcript dial  <br/>
818-848-6500. Some of my shows can be purchased from <br/>
Laissez Faire Books  800/326-0996 or <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.laissezfairebooks.com">http://www.laissezfairebooks.com</a> <br/>
(I&#39;m told that Laissez  Faire Books expedites the orders <br/>
faster).<br/>
<br/>
Just  as we had finished the Education show, we <br/>
had to &quot;open it up&quot; again because  Florida&#39;s Supreme <br/>
Court ruled that public money can&#39;t be spent on private  <br/>
schools because the state constitution commands the <br/>
funding only of  &quot;uniform ? high-quality&quot; schools. How <br/>
absurd. As if government schools are  high quality. <br/>
In Florida, and most places, competition, which made <br/>
even  the Postal Service improve, is unconstitutional <br/>
when it comes to public  education.<br/>

<br/>
======================================<br/>
<br/>
Note: Exodus Mandate  specializes in bringing to evangelical <br/>
Christians the message to get their  children out of <br/>
the spiritually and morally &quot;officially Godless&quot; government  <br/>
schools. <br/>
<br/>
Further note: The Alliance, from whom you are getting  <br/>
this email, is indeed an ***alliance*** of people of <br/>
many faiths,  religions, and worldviews. Indeed, it <br/>
just might be the broadest alliance,  as measured by <br/>
variety of worldviews and political ideologies, in <br/>
the  history of man. <br/>
<br/>
Special note to non-religious people: I put most, but  <br/>
not all, of my energy into reaching religious people, <br/>
especially  evangelicals, Catholics, Jews, and Mormons. <br/>
Why? Here in the States, they  have the largest numbers!<br/>
<br/>
But I also invest considerable time in trying  to reach <br/>
secularists and those with differing spiritual systems, <br/>
from  atheists to agnostics, from Muslims to New Thought <br/>
and New Age, and even an  occasional Druze, Russian <br/>
Orthodox, and Zoroastrian.  <br/>
<br/>

PS: Here is an  interesting attack on Stossel for his <br/>
attack on public schools in an earlier  &quot;Give Me a Break&quot; <br/>
segment.<br/>

<br/>
It shows the  stretching the Public School Establishment <br/>
can do to parry all attacks on  it. Here is the beginning <br/>
of this piece Note it was done six years ago,  about <br/>
the time I first met John and we had a nice  chat.<br/>
