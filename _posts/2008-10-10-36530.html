<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756840397">I absolutely think that inviting your child to take part in things <br/>
you are doing in your life (whether they may be educational or not) <br/>
is the RIGHT thing to do!  Your kids will be experiencing so much by <br/>
being included in your everyday (or not so everyday) activities.  I <br/>
think the most important thing to remember is that if it feels right <br/>
and makes everyone feel good then it is absolutely okay.  My main <br/>
focus is to make sure that I am treating my kids the way I want to be <br/>
treated.  You definitely don&#39;t want to let the label of &quot;unschooling&quot; <br/>
make you do things differently than what feels right...trust your <br/>
instincts!<br/>
<br/>
I am new to this list and I haven&#39;t read the previous posts, but I <br/>
wanted to encourage you that you are certainly on the right path if <br/>
you are desiring to include your kids in your daily activities.  If <br/>
they want to participate that is great...and if not that is great <br/>
too :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1188355059">Maybe the point others have been making has been completely missed.<br/>
<br/>
Disagreeing is not flaming.  I&#39;ve never seen any flaming except from a rare<br/>
handful of newbies.  People on these boards who have been unschooling a long<br/>
while (most of them way longer than me) may DISAGREE with part or all of a<br/>
post.<br/>
<br/>
Long time unschoolers are volunteering time to help new unschoolers.<br/>
They&#39;re passing on what they&#39;ve found to work.  Experience is hard to argue<br/>
with.  It&#39;s convincing.  Meeting their kids in real life is even more<br/>
convincing.  Seeing the trust in the relationships between the parents and<br/>
children in real life is even *more* convincing.  I figure they just might<br/>
know what they&#39;re talking about.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s several options to choose from when inquiring about unschooling (or<br/>
posting on an unschooling list) and some work better than others.<br/>
<br/>
If someone says hey... &quot;not quite&quot; ask why and you could learn something.<br/>
Or if they say &quot;hey not quite and here&#39;s why&quot; you can ask for even more<br/>
clarification and you might learn something.<br/>
<br/>
Even better (in my experience) if someone disagrees with your post, pretend<br/>
to yourself that it&#39;s not yours.  Discussions are not geared toward<br/>
personalities.  Instead they revolve around ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Or don&#39;t post for a while and just lurk.  I did like you and posted, was<br/>
disagreed with, and decided to quietly lurk for a time and read more before<br/>
I spoke anymore.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1728621448">---------snip-----------<br/>
<br/>
I think my point was completely missed.<br/>
----------snip-------<br/>
 What I read and responded to was :<br/>
&quot;Melt and Pour is a great craft and learning tool (hygene, science (solid, liquid), color theory, etc.) You definatly could incorporate learning about how soap in made traditionally and eventually results in the glycerine soap <br/>
you and your children can safely craft with. I have a shortened to the point explaination (on the &quot;About Us&quot; page under FAQ&#39;s at www.kissingmoons. com) on my website on how soap is made, History of Castille soap, what is in commercial soaps and how it is different from traditional handcraftred soap, etc if you would like to use that information. &quot;<br/>
Whatever the point of posting that  the suggestion was that you can use the making of glycerine soap as a tool for introducing ideas about hygiene, physical science, color theory and for introducing the history of castille soap and comparing the process used in making soap yourself versus the ivory soap you&#39;d buy at the store. <br/>
<br/>
David and I were just standing in the kitchen talking about why he makes soap or brews beer or fixes the car or why I knit or garden or bike. All of those things are about function. They are about getting something done. I bike to get to the store to buy milk or sherbet or frozen curly fries, or whatever, I knit because I enjoy the feel of the wool and the click of the needles and the calmness. David fixes the car because he likes to make it work better and run better and to keep it from falling apart. None of those things are done with the goal to learn something tangential to the point. That will happen. I have this fantastic book of knitted gansey patterns that talks alot about the history of the gansey and has pictures from the late 1800&#39;s of places in the UK where I&#39;ve been which is kind of cool, &#39;cause the book was a gift when I lived in Albuquerque and had no plans of living in the UK. You will also get those wonderful McGyver moments where you<br/>
 can use the knowledge you gained while fixing up the bike, or bringing soap to trace or using borax as a preservative to solve some other, seemingly unrelated, problem. But again, I don&#39;t garden to prepare myself to solve an as of yet unknown problem that I may find myself dealing with later down the road.<br/>
<br/>
---------snip----------<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not suggesting going into something with an educational agenda.<br/>
Rather, I&#39;m suggesting a parent invite a child to do something with<br/>
the parent. Just do, not necessarily learn.<br/>
----------snip------------<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ll learn and not just do. It isn&#39;t possible to do and not learn, if not about the task at hand than about something else.  Try it. Try doing something, even sleeping, and not learning. You&#39;ll wake up rested, maybe, and filled with the cobwebs of dreams and thoughts and plans for the day ahead. Making soap is full of learning. But it doesn&#39;t need to be a &quot;learning opportunity&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
I invite Simon and Linnaea to do stuff with me all the time, and, cooler still,  they invite me to do stuff with them. My point wasn&#39;t about inviting their company when I engage in an activity I think they might enjoy. My point was that inviting a child to join in with you with a preplanned list of teaching bullet points that the activity should achieve isn&#39;t a way to facilitate a fun time hanging out making soap. It becomes a lecture and not an engaging thing to do. The other stuff will come up, maybe. Maybe you&#39;ll be snuggling up together reading Little House on the Prarie (I seem to recall some soap making mention) and the history will be related, and the experience will already be present, or maybe it won&#39;t. Life is long and learning is always happening, maybe the possibility for knowing about material sciences and going from liquid to solid will come up again and again and again. I make a lot of ice.<br/>
<br/>
----------snip------------<br/>
I&#39;m not saying that a parent should say &quot;Come do this with me because<br/>
you might learn a thing or two.&quot; I&#39;m saying invite the kid to do<br/>
something, allow him/her the opportunity to say yes or no. If yes<br/>
great! Interest might be peaked, but that isn&#39;t the goal anyway. If<br/>
not, well, that&#39;s fine too. *shrugs*<br/>
--------------snip------------<br/>
But it was implied in the post that I responded to. It was suggested that the point of making glycerine soap was to impart all the tangential knowledge that soap making may touch on. The history of soap, the comparing and contrasting of large scale soap making versus homemade soap making, the science of liquids and solids, the theory of color, the hygiene potential. <br/>
Absolutely, though invite your kids to do lots of things. I spend a lot of time coming up with new things to invite Simon and Linnaea to do with me. And I don&#39;t press them if they say no. And the goal is, at least in some part, to pique their interest. I want to engage them, so I offer things that I hope will do so. Things that I want to do, as well. <br/>
<br/>
--------------snip------------<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to this, so please don&#39;t flame me! <br/>
<br/>
------------snip------------<br/>
I&#39;m not flaming you. Flaming, according to wikipedia is: <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Flaming is the hostile and insulting interaction between Internet users. Flaming usually occurs in the social context of a discussion board, Internet Relay Chat (IRC) or even through e-mail. An Internet user typically generates a<br/>
flame response to other posts or users posting on a site, and such a<br/>
response is usually not constructive, does not clarify a discussion,<br/>
and does not persuade others. Sometimes, flamers attempt to<br/>
assert their authority or establish a position of superiority over<br/>
other users. Other times, a flamer is simply an individual who believes<br/>
he or she carries the only valid opinion. This leads him or her to personally attack those who disagree. In some cases, flamers wish to upset and offend<br/>
other members of the forum, in which case they can be called &quot;trolls.&quot; Most often however, flames are angry or insulting messages transmitted by people who have strong feelings about a subject.&quot;<br/>
On a discussion list like this the ideas, the words that are posted are going to be examined and discussed. I have no desire to hurt or upset you or anyone else on this list. I want to help others and be helped by others to understand and embrace unschooling. If someone comes here and talks about the educational potential of an activity there will probably be a discussion around the idea of doing something simply because of it&#39;s learning potential. However there may be very intense discussions defending the learning potential of the activities that children choose to engage in, like video games, or watching Spongebob Squarepants.  I fully believe that Simon and Linnaea would learn alot about different things making soap. What I don&#39;t believe is that I can direct and limit their learning effectively when making soap. And I think if I tried I would suffocate a lot of the joy of the activity. <br/>
<br/>
------------snip--------------<br/>
<br/>
I worry that to be a proper<br/>
unschooler means to *not* initiate inclusion of one&#39;s child in one&#39;s<br/>
life. Is it ok, for example, to say to one&#39;s child, &quot;Hey, I&#39;m going to<br/>
[place] to do [activity]. Wanna come?&quot; Or &quot;I&#39;m going to make [craft or<br/>
food item]. Care to join me?&quot; It worries me because I fear that if I<br/>
do that and then come onto an unschooling list and offer my<br/>
experiences having done that then I will be chastised for having done<br/>
so. I&#39;m not trying to be mean or spiteful by asking this. Instead I<br/>
literally feel paralyzed from doing anything with my kids by fear of<br/>
potentially having the wrong intention, or that it might look to an<br/>
outsider like I had an educational agenda.<br/>
------------snip--------------<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t want to be an unschooler if it left me feeling paralyzed about getting it right. I wouldn&#39;t want to be an unschooler if it felt like it was building walls between me engaging, playing, being with Simon and Linnaea. I don&#39;t think anyone here is chastizing anyone else for inviting their kids to join in the fun. <br/>

<br/>
Absolutey! We encourage adults to make their lives as completely<br/>
accessible to their children as possible. Anyone who has read at this<br/>
list for more than, oh, five minutes would know that!<br/>
<br/>
SO....we seem to have quite a few new folks this week and I&#39;m going to<br/>
gently and kindly encourage you all to read for a week or two. Not as<br/>
a mandate. Just as a way for you to get your Unschooling Basics legs<br/>
under you.:)<br/>
<br/>
Several of you are posting about things that will become common<br/>
knowledge if you read here for a little while and get a feel for the<br/>
kind of list this is and the kind of advice that is actively shared.<br/>
<br/>
Arhives will give you the gist of it too. It is common for us to talk<br/>
about inviting children into our activities. It is common for us to<br/>
talk about how to make our lives and homes non-age discriminatory. It<br/>
is common for us to talk about sharing our lives with NO<br/>
teaching/learning agenda. It&#39;s ok to talk about it again and again,<br/>
but when you&#39;re new to a list it&#39;s nice to get a feel for it so you<br/>
aren&#39;t fumbling around stating the obvious and getting your feelings<br/>
hurt in the process.<br/>
<br/>
We WANT our new members to stay and share the dialogue with us! That&#39;s<br/>
the whole point of the list.:) It will flow so much smoother if you<br/>
step into the party already in action, and listen for a little while<br/>
before posting.<br/>
<br/>
Just a suggestion. Picture me sitting across the table from you<br/>
sipping some tea and smiling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-630506978">I&#39;m going to jump on the discussion for a moment, just because I  <br/>
think something very vital is being missed.<br/>
<br/>
Erin, no one is saying NOT to invite kids to join in on life. What is  <br/>
being discussed is inviting them and then inundating them with a  <br/>
bunch of knowledge that they either don&#39;t want or don&#39;t care about. A  <br/>
parent can take the most fun outing and ruin it by filling it with  <br/>
&quot;Did you know...&quot; or &quot;The first soap was created 3000 years ago  <br/>
by ....&quot; The point is to share the world with them to the extent that  <br/>
the child is curious. I only emphasize this because I know that *I*  <br/>
am so very passionate about some things, but in the beginning of our  <br/>
unschooling, I really ruined it for my children by filling the air  <br/>
with stuff about them...it was all about what *I* knew. Thankfully  <br/>
six months of deschooling led my son to feel strong enough to say  <br/>
&quot;MOM! We know you know this, let us have FUN.&quot; The girls were too  <br/>
worried about my feelings to say anything, but they did start to tune  <br/>
me out because I wasn&#39;t being respectful of their desires.<br/>
<br/>
And no one is saying that it&#39;s not okay to share factoids, if it is  <br/>
something one is truly excited about, if there is no teaching agenda,  <br/>
and IF one is willing to be not be disappointed if the child couldn&#39;t  <br/>
care less. Does that make sense?<br/>
I for one could spend hours talking about evolution and the  <br/>
comparative anatomy of hominids at the ape exhibit at our zoo, and  <br/>
the kids have long since gotten over that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2066040900">I was thinking about that as I cleaned out the freezer today. I was thinking about how it could be a teaching moment. I could invite Linnaea or Simon to help me deal with the frosty trays in our freezer having first researched the history of Frigidaire, which is the make of fridge in my house, so that I could lecture on the history of that company. I could talk about the ice houses that I&#39;ve read about where in winter ice from a pond would be cut and stored nestled in hay in a dark and well insulated building so that there might be coolness and food storage on offer in summer.  And then how ice boxes were the fantastic way of keeping things cool for everyone, not just those folks with access to an ice house and maybe I could talk about my vague recollections of A Tree Goes in Brooklyn having an ice man bringing ice up the stairs to their apartment.  Those are interesting things, to me, this wanderings through the history and importance of keeping food<br/>
 fresh and cool. And I could talk about that and how a lot of different kinds of food preparation are about keeping something from going bad, like smoking or curing meat (although the best beef is hung for a while before it is treated, or so I am led to understand), or making cheese and yoghurt. Some of those things Simon and Linnaea may already know, some of those little bits and bobs of information may have bubbled up into their lives through me or David or one of the other many routes that they have to information. I talk a lot, David does as well. There are lots of discussions about lots of things that happen in our lives, often as they are happening. Stories that are told when cooking or watching a show or going for a walk or cuddling up in bed. And I would have talked about something if Simon or Linnaea had helped to clean out the freezer. But it wouldn&#39;t have been staged. Maybe that is the point. It would have just been a conversation with both<br/>
 sides giving and altering and moving from subject to subject without any known goal. <br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I finished cleaning out the freezer by myself. Linnaea went out to the new old car we bought last weekend and drove home this morning and she sat with a book on the warm black leatherette car seats with a smell that reminds me completely of my childhood and read. Simon ate an apple and watched some videos on youtube and David looked at all the rust points on the car that he wants to fix. They all learned the things that they wanted to in that moment and I enjoyed, as I always do, washing out the frosty freezer thinking thoughts and dwelling on memories of other freezers in my life. No one was sullied by my lesson plans to accompany cleaning out a freezer. And now you can open the ice drawer without using a foot for leverage (for those not familiar with the UK design of fridge, the freezer is usually on the bottom with the fridge section on the top, it isn&#39;t a big box with shelves, it&#39;s a box with drawers:<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to jump on the discussion for a moment, just because I <br/>
think something very vital is being missed.<br/>
<br/>
Erin, no one is saying NOT to invite kids to join in on life. What is <br/>
being discussed is inviting them and then inundating them with a <br/>
bunch of knowledge that they either don&#39;t want or don&#39;t care about. A <br/>
parent can take the most fun outing and ruin it by filling it with <br/>
&quot;Did you know...&quot; or &quot;The first soap was created 3000 years ago <br/>
by ....&quot; The point is to share the world with them to the extent that <br/>
the child is curious. I only emphasize this because I know that *I* <br/>
am so very passionate about some things, but in the beginning of our <br/>
unschooling, I really ruined it for my children by filling the air <br/>
with stuff about them...it was all about what *I* knew. Thankfully <br/>
six months of deschooling led my son to feel strong enough to say <br/>
&quot;MOM! We know you know this, let us have FUN.&quot; The girls were too <br/>
worried about my feelings to say anything, but they did start to tune <br/>
me out because I wasn&#39;t being respectful of their desires.<br/>
<br/>
And no one is saying that it&#39;s not okay to share factoids, if it is <br/>
something one is truly excited about, if there is no teaching agenda, <br/>
and IF one is willing to be not be disappointed if the child couldn&#39;t <br/>
care less. Does that make sense?<br/>
I for one could spend hours talking about evolution and the <br/>
comparative anatomy of hominids at the ape exhibit at our zoo, and <br/>
the kids have long since gotten over that.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A better question to ask is if your kids suspect an educational <br/>
agenda. For some kids that&#39;s more important than others, for sure - <br/>
if you&#39;ve homeschooled, for example, it may take longer for kids to <br/>
trust that there isn&#39;t an agenda lurking behind every suggestion <br/>
than if the kids were used to leaving school in the backpack when <br/>
they came home every day.<br/>
<br/>
For this reason (in part) its often suggested that new unschoolers <br/>
live like they are on vacation for awhile. Do the sorts of fun <br/>
things families do when there&#39;s no expectation that anyone learn <br/>
anything. That give the whole family time to learn more about each <br/>
other as people and rebuild the relationships that school and/or <br/>
homeschool have damaged.<br/>

Wow, Schuyler, that&#39;s the first time I ever skimmed one of your <br/>
posts! The moment I got to &quot;ice houses&quot; my eyes glazed over and I <br/>
wondered if there was still coffee left in the pot and did we have <br/>
*any* coco in the house? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad I found the last part about your real day and the kids <br/>
reading and eating apples... what a lovely snapshot, complete with <br/>
odors, ahhhhhh. <br/>
<br/>
Mo and I spent the afternoon hanging around in the sewing studio, <br/>
she on the computer playing The Incredible Machine, which has kind <br/>
of quirky old dance music for background sound, and I trying to <br/>
contrive a curtain for my big round window. I&#39;m trying to applique a <br/>
sun on one side and a moon on the other, all out of flimsy polyester <br/>
fabrics that don&#39;t cooperate without a lot of starch. Every now and <br/>
then Mo would call out &quot;come see this one!&quot; and I&#39;d go look at the <br/>
fantastice &quot;contraption&quot; she&#39;d created on the computer. They&#39;re <br/>
silly sorts of contraptions that include bombs and alligators and <br/>
lots of pulleys, much fun. <br/>
<br/>
At some point we went back to the house (the studio is in an old <br/>
barn) for snacks and I had one of those smell-my-kid&#39;s-hair moments. <br/>
I often forget to do that, but I&#39;ve been spending more time on RUN <br/>
and Sandra recommends that alot, so its on my mind. So my afternoon <br/>
smelled like starch and little girl and overheated polyester and <br/>
milky cereal and home-made spaghetti sauce and light machine oil. In <br/>
a little while my evening will probably smell of popcorn and juice <br/>
and little girl while Mo and I watch some cartoons, snuggled <br/>
together in the bed. George and Ray are off playing music so its a <br/>
girls night, here.<br/>

Yes, after I read the posts I realized that!  I was just a little too <br/>
quick to throw in my thoughts...oops :)  As I said in my post--I <br/>
hadn&#39;t read the replies to her initial post, but I felt the urge to <br/>
throw in my thoughts on the &quot;new topic&quot; regarding whether or not she <br/>

 </span></blockquote>The catch is that children&#39;s perceptions can be pretty different <br/>
from adult perceptions. From an unschooling standpoint, that means <br/>
its really important to try to understand our kids&#39; perspectives. It <br/>
helps us communicate better.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; little paragraph.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t see any ruffled feathers. The purpose of this list is to <br/>
help people wrap their minds around the principles, philosophy *and* <br/>
nuts and bolts of radical unschooling - and all those things swirl <br/>
around together, part of the same thing. Figuring out how to handle <br/>
bedtime, for example, involves fostering communication, which <br/>
involves parents stretching our perceptions to include those of the <br/>
kids, which involves drawing on our personal principles. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what all this seeming nit-pickiness over words and phrases is <br/>
about - online like this, all we have are words to express the <br/>
swirling complexity of family interactions, so we tend to get very <br/>
specific about what they mean and how they&#39;re used.<br/>

<br/>
Feathers weren&#39;t ruffled, trust me.;)<br/>
If they were, you&#39;d know it!<br/>
<br/>
This is part of the &quot;read for a while&quot; recommendation because this<br/>
list exists for the purpose of discussion. Discussion that questions<br/>
and examines and prods and clarifies. Quite often new folks don&#39;t<br/>
understand the nature of the list and when they get 8 or more posts<br/>
responding to some simple sentence or paragraph they are shocked.<br/>
<br/>
Just remember, tons of responses doesn&#39;t mean anyone is ganging up, or<br/>
getting &quot;ruffled&quot;, it&#39;s just that there are over 2,000 people reading<br/>
and a small percentage responding to your thoughts and writing. It<br/>
feels overwhelming sometimes. <br/>
<br/>
Nobody is upset. Nobody is picking on anyone. The list is here for the<br/>
purpose of deeply examining exactly what we mean, how we think and<br/>
taking our mindfulness to a new level. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1906625159">See, it&#39;s such a good thing that I don&#39;t make Simon and Linnaea follow some curriculum, I was thinking how inspired my freezer defrosting educational gambit was. I&#39;m quite relieved, oddly, to find that what I may find engaging can bore someone else to ruminating about hot beverages. Much better to let other people&#39;s interests engage them than to force them to conform to my own. <br/>

Wow, Schuyler, that&#39;s the first time I ever skimmed one of your <br/>
posts! The moment I got to &quot;ice houses&quot; my eyes glazed over and I <br/>
wondered if there was still coffee left in the pot and did we have <br/>
*any* coco in the house? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad I found the last part about your real day and the kids <br/>
reading and eating apples... what a lovely snapshot, complete with <br/>
odors, ahhhhhh. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hey and the other thing that&#39;s good about the small percentage &quot;gang&quot;<br/>
answering a lone post is that when we need to post a question that needs<br/>
LOTS of ideas or at least a bigger pool to choose from, it&#39;s a fantastic<br/>
benefit!<br/>
<br/>
I think another part of the bafflement from newbies who gets lots of<br/>
responses is that the replies all sound so similar to the newbie because<br/>
there&#39;s a little learning curve to picking up on the ideas so that a newbie<br/>
can *see* the finer details that help unschooling so much.<br/>
