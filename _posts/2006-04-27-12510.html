<div id="ygrps-yiv-1856268606">I&#39;ve been on a quest to find a children&#39;s &quot;picture&quot; book I heard at a parent<br/>
read aloud for the last 4 yrs.  I&#39;m hoping maybe one of you knows of this<br/>
book, or even better has it and can tell me the title or author.  I&#39;ve<br/>
already searched with all area librarians, and even school librarians and no<br/>
one seems to be able to help me.  I&#39;m hoping maybe one of you can.  The book<br/>
is the beautiful story of how every event affects everything.  It begins<br/>
(and I believe the title had something to do with this first event) with a<br/>
frog jumping up out of a pond to try and catch a dragonfly (I believe) to<br/>
eat.  The dragonfly flies up only to be sought by a bird.  Many of the<br/>
events following this are very sketchy.  The bird does something that<br/>
affects a plane.  All of these and other events I can&#39;t recall lead to a<br/>
woman in a red hat window shopping.  The hat goes flying, and a man catches<br/>
it, which as you can guess leads to their chance encounter, them falling in<br/>
love and getting married.  (Again more events I can&#39;t recall)  The final<br/>
event of the story is the granddaughter of the woman playing dress up or tea<br/>
party or something in the backyard wearing the red hat.  The wind once again<br/>
catches the hat and blows it into the neighbor&#39;s yard.  The girl climbs the<br/>
fence to retrieve her hat and finds her neighbor laying face down in the<br/>
yard.  He had had a heart attack.  In the end the girl saves him and the<br/>
author reiterates how all of this would never had happened had it not been<br/>
for the frog swimming in the pond and an unsuspecting dragonfly.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Sound familiar to anyone?  This is probably the biggest group of mothers I<br/>
feel I can reach, I&#39;m desperately hoping that one of you knows of this book.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for your help,<br/>
