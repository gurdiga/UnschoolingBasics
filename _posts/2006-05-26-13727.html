<div id="ygrps-yiv-685767100">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
What an amazing day! We are so new to all of this but it was nothing <br/>
short of fascinating to see other unschooling families and also, to be <br/>
looking at everyone&#39;s name tag to find familiar names! I&#39;ve met a few <br/>
people who post here and am looking forward to going back tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
Ben Lovejoy was SO enthralling. There were maybe 20-30 people in the <br/>
room. His talk made SO MUCH SENSE. It was also great to hear that, for <br/>
their son, it took 18 months to deschool. I&#39;m there! And it&#39;s a scary <br/>
feeling, at times. I&#39;m excited for my husband to go to the Dad&#39;s talk <br/>
tomorrow! I can&#39;t imagine a skeptic remaining after hearing Ben talk :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m beaming! And I had to share! :)<br/>
<br/>
Warmly<br/>
