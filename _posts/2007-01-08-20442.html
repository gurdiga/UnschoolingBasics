<div id="ygrps-yiv-1360076363">Hi,<br/>
I am from fairly new to unschooling and have been watching in the <br/>
back ground.  So far so good.  we are really enjoying it and we are <br/>
all less tense and stressed out!  My main problem is that my dd (8ys <br/>
old) and ds (6 yrs old) have had poor eating habits from the <br/>
beginning.  I nursed them both for 1.5 yrs but ever since they <br/>
started eating solid foods they will not eat veggies and fruit (even <br/>
hidden in food - they claim it doesn&#39;t taste good!)  I have tried <br/>
preparing them every single way possible!  My husband and I love <br/>
fruits and vegetables and they are always available.  My ds won&#39;t <br/>
even try fruit or veggies.  Not even a taste!  So I have long given <br/>
up.  Now that we are unschooling -still deschooling - what should I <br/>
do?  I have let it go for years and they still do NOT choose healthy <br/>
food over sugary/salty stuff.  I find if I do not at least insist <br/>
they eat their protein and carbs at meal times (pretty much the only <br/>
things they will eat) they won&#39;t eat anything and go right to desert. <br/>
My dd is obsessed/addicted to sweets.  How do I get out of this <br/>
cycle?  Are you SURE that if I let them choose what they want to eat <br/>
that they will eventually pick healthy things?  How long will this <br/>
take?  And how do I get my son to try fruits and veggies etc.??  He <br/>
will not even put them in his mouth!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-196917156">~~I have let it go for years and they still do NOT choose healthy<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Quit making dessert. Let me explain....<br/>
by making something sweet for AFTER a meal, you are automatically<br/>
setting it up to be more desirable. When we make a sweet dessert, it<br/>
gets served with everything else that is for the meal. There are many<br/>
times my children choose to leave it until last, by choice, but there<br/>
is never any restriction on which dishes they eat or in what order.<br/>
<br/>
Saving dessert until after a meal sets it up to be THE desired item.<br/>
If you&#39;re making it for the meal, just serve it all up and let<br/>
everyone eat  what they want. Seriously.<br/>
<br/>
Jalen ate nothing but the dessert item for dinner once. It had<br/>
raspberries and cream, so at least he was getting some form of fiber<br/>
and protein.:)<br/>
<br/>
Make desserts that have doses of great ingredients. Whole wheat can be<br/>
baked into so many, many items....fruits make wonderful sweet dishes<br/>
in combination with other ingredients or on their own (but you said<br/>
they don&#39;t like fruit alone right?).<br/>
<br/>
What about providing a lot of dips for them? I&#39;ve found that if a<br/>
young child can dip food, they&#39;re more likely to eat it. Ketchup,<br/>
peanut butter (or other nut butters) whipped cream, sour cream, hummus<br/>
etc....are all ways to offer up another food while making dipping fun.<br/>
<br/>
Dessert can be almost the healthiest thing you serve!! I really don&#39;t<br/>
understand why there has to be this &quot;no sweets in order for children<br/>
to be healthy&quot; attitude (not saying YOU said this, just the general<br/>
discussion) because if a parent is truly concerned about health, then<br/>
they should be making foods that the child enjoys rather than<br/>
restricting what the child shouldn&#39;t have.<br/>
<br/>
If there are real (not parental fears) health issues, then why not<br/>
look at it as an adventure? Why not bake and cook all sorts of fun<br/>
foods that the child might want to try? Why go all restrictive and<br/>
tell them what they can&#39;t have? Kids want to be safe, if they<br/>
understand something is truly making them very sick, why can&#39;t the<br/>
parent find a suitable alternative to the thing they desire?<br/>
(responding here to the posts about children that were truly sick)<br/>
<br/>
Once again, &quot;no&quot; closes doors where an attitude of &quot;let&#39;s explore this<br/>
situation&quot; brings about a number of solutions in which the child can<br/>
be empowered to choose.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, don&#39;t set dessert up to be the most desirable dish, just serve<br/>
it. Make your desserts full of yummy AND healthy ingredients and let<br/>
them go to town. Buy a multi-vitamin and trust that they will<br/>
eventually branch out and try more and more foods....but probably not<br/>
if you make a big deal about it. The less said, the better right now.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with Ren, and I know this from experience with my 5 year old,<br/>
Joanna, who changes food preferences *daily* these days.  One day she&#39;ll<br/>
think something is totally YUMMY and the next day, yuk.<br/>
<br/>
Joanna was the person who ate the most of her candy houses at Christmas,<br/>
and yet these days she&#39;s lost her enthusiasm for candy.<br/>
<br/>
By letting her eat what she wanted (a day, or even a few days without<br/>
&#39;adequate&#39; nutrition won&#39;t scar them for life), it all balanced out in<br/>
the end.  For instance, Joanna is less keen on green leafy salads<br/>
regardless of dressing, but loves celery, sometimes with dip, a pita<br/>
wrap which she loves to fill with colorful veggies (red peppers, green<br/>
peppers, sprouts - depends on type - grated carrots or sliced carrots),<br/>
an eye-candy array of pleasant looking ripe fruit.  (kids respond well<br/>
to eye appeal, especially the visual type learners)   A pita which THEY<br/>
choose the ingredients to fill gets a lot of things in they&#39;ll enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
When she sees me having a few organic sunflower seeds and enjoying them<br/>
(I don&#39;t initiate for her to have some), she wants some &quot;too&quot;, and I<br/>
give it to her.<br/>
<br/>
If I show a desire and craving for the best that grows, and she sees me<br/>
biting into a delicious red pepper with a tasty dip, and really enjoying<br/>
it (not exaggeratedly, but genuine), she&#39;ll want to try it too.  She may<br/>
not like it, so we explore other options - together.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve never been a &quot;dessert&quot; family.  It&#39;s just never dawned on us that<br/>
it&#39;s something people &quot;do&quot;... I never grew up with dessert, much (except<br/>
for special dinners)<br/>
<br/>
When we are stocked up on our fruit and crackers and snacky type foods,<br/>
they eat lots of that between their meals (plain fruit mostly digests<br/>
best on an empty stomach, and doesn&#39;t mix well with heavy foods) so when<br/>
suppertime hits, we relax and don&#39;t worry if today Joanna doesn&#39;t like<br/>
the basmati rice which she ate with gusto yesterday - she can always<br/>
have a piece of pita and whatever (she rarely turns those down), or some<br/>
pretzels as a snack.<br/>
<br/>
My kids help me pick out the fruits and veggies in the produce section<br/>
too.  She begged me for the bagged organic baby carrots one day.  I said<br/>
&quot;sure&quot;.  I didn&#39;t say, &quot;Now make sure you eat them this time, as I don&#39;t<br/>
want to throw them away like usual&quot; (it was tempting though!)  And when<br/>
I got home they barely made it to the fridge!<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this post is so long.  It takes less time to &quot;say&quot; verbally in<br/>
story-telling form than it does to read.<br/>

desserts. By healthy I do NOT mean low fat or low<br/>
sugar. I mean higher in protein and complex<br/>
carbohydrates. You can do lots of things with eggs,<br/>
milk, whole wheat and oatmeal.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t do desserts after a meal. My kid&#39;s appetites<br/>
are not large enough to be able to enjoy a dessert<br/>
after a meal. In my family, sweet goodies are eaten as<br/>
snacks any time of the day.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think taste buds change as kids grow older. I hated<br/>
veggies when I was that age. I mother went thru<br/>
&quot;phases&quot; when she would try to get me to eat a<br/>
spoonful of veggie. Caused nothing but bad memories<br/>
for me. I grew up essentially on bread with jam and<br/>
milk.<br/>
<br/>
Then somewhere around the age of 13 or 14, I started<br/>
eating vegetables. I liked them. I don&#39;t know what<br/>
changed, but I&#39;m a big veggie eater now. I don&#39;t know<br/>
what changed, but in hindsight my mother&#39;s efforts to<br/>
get me to eat were a waste of time.<br/>

<br/>
Insisting that they eat certain foods at certain times in a certain <br/>
order doesn&#39;t sound like &quot;letting it go&quot; to me - and probably <br/>
doesn&#39;t feel that way to the kids. From their perspective, they <br/>
don&#39;t have a lot of control over what they eat, so they are grabbing <br/>
what they can as hard as they can. <br/>
<br/>
Are they involved in the menu planning and shopping? Are they <br/>
allowed to choose what kinds of foods y&#39;all buy and have on hand - <br/>
really choose, not &quot;choose from the subset of foods that don&#39;t make <br/>
mom cringe&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And how do I get my son to try fruits and veggies etc.??  He <br/>
&gt; will not even put them in his mouth!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do they not drink juice? That&#39;s our main source of fruit around <br/>
here. Mo&#39;s not a big veggie eater, but she loves to &quot;wild harvest&quot; <br/>
foods or eat directly from the garden. I&#39;ve shown her what&#39;s edible <br/>
in the yard, and periodically she goes out and grazes! I&#39;m a big fan <br/>
of edible flowers, personally, so I plant a lot of those. I&#39;ve never <br/>
told her she &quot;should&quot; eat them, or talked about them in terms of <br/>
nutrition at all (actually it started out of desparation, we have <br/>
some very toxic weeds around here, and I didn&#39;t want to just <br/>
say &quot;don&#39;t eat plants&quot;!).<br/>
<br/>
Your ds may have reached a point of not trusting that you will offer <br/>
him things that appeal to him, so he&#39;s refusing everything, even if <br/>
he might have tried it left to his own devices. Kids can be very <br/>
conservative about new foods - some have to see other people eating <br/>
them several times before they feel comfortable trying something <br/>
new. If you&#39;re concerned, find a multivitamin he likes so you don&#39;t <br/>
feel the urge to push, as it were. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My dd is obsessed/addicted to sweets.  How do I get out of this <br/>
&gt; cycle?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d start with a language shift - how &#39;bout &quot;loves&quot; or &quot;glories in&quot;? <br/>
It seems like a little thing, but changing our words -especially the <br/>
ones inside our heads- helps to alter our perspective. Right now <br/>
your perspective is your dd is &quot;out of control&quot; wrt food. Even if <br/>
you aren&#39;t saying that out loud, you are sending her that message in <br/>
lots of little ways. That&#39;s a dangerous message to send! She&#39;s going <br/>
to have to negotiate a world full of a million different food-<br/>
choices every day for the rest of her life, so the last thing you <br/>
want her to feel is &quot;out of control&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Ren had great things to say about desserts, here&#39;s my addition:<br/>
<br/>
When trying to make good food taste good, I like to keep in mind the <br/>
wisdom of Julia Child: fat is flavor. <br/>
<br/>
I love to add nut-meal to baked goods - I even like to toss some in <br/>
boxed cake mixes. We all seem to enjoy that, and the added protein <br/>
goes a long way to letting me feel comfortable about cupcakes for <br/>
breakfast (that was yesterday). The protein also lets everyone <br/>
feel &quot;full&quot; sooner, so things don&#39;t get eaten as quickly. That helps <br/>
fuel a sense of abundance, too, which cuts down on some of <br/>
the &quot;competitive eating&quot; that goes on around here.<br/>
<br/>
 I also like to do all my baking with real butter, not margarine or <br/>
shortening. Its noticably more flavorful *and* more nutritious. Win-<br/>
win. I use a modified biscuit recipe for cookies - lots of butter <br/>
and/or nut butter, maybe some nut-meal *and* its ready to roll out <br/>
for cookie cutters without having to chill for an hour, which gets <br/>
my 5yr old all excited. A couple weeks ago we divided the dough up <br/>
and made three different color cookies, and then swirled cookies. <br/>
Oooooh Aaaaaaah. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad you&#39;re looking for ways to encourage healthy eating <br/>
*besides* saying No. That&#39;s a big step of trust right there! Now <br/>
take a big deep breath and take a few more tiny little steps ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-984223237">I rarely post here, mostly read messages ;-)  But, wanted to tell you<br/>
what we do. <br/>
 <br/>
I have a 5 yo. that *never* liked fruit.  I think the only fruit he<br/>
tasted as a fruit is a banana.  Other than that, even the purées I made<br/>
as a baby he gaged on  or showed distate to.  Veggies?  Well, except<br/>
mashed potatoes and corn-from-a-can, none other.  <br/>
 <br/>
He lived to 4 3/4yo on breastmilk, cheerios, mashed potates, white rice,<br/>
ice cream, cheese, real apple juice and not much else I can think of.<br/>
He&#39;s never been pressured to taste, although I will ask him if he wants<br/>
to when I make something new, and as of the last month maybe, he started<br/>
answering &quot; What does it taste like?&quot;.  I give him the most honest<br/>
answer I have (with brother&#39;s sometimes chiming in) and he sometimes<br/>
chooses to try.  <br/>
 <br/>
He started eating commercial fruit purées lately and loves those. I keep<br/>
a stash that I know he likes in arms reach.  And also, some puréed soups<br/>
are good.  Not everyone and not everytime.  But, he started asking for<br/>
some of these soups, so he likes them, I guess ;-)  <br/>
 <br/>
So, don&#39;t pressure it, don&#39;t hide it, be honest about what&#39;s in it, and<br/>
find new meals to try.  Be patient, loving and open-minded about the<br/>
foods they choose.  Have them help making a meal.  Make the tomato sauce<br/>
for the pizza ;-)  Add pineapple.  Make yours special, add roasted<br/>
onions, olives, and offer them to take theirs and yours...  Show them<br/>
how veggies are part of the foods we eat and not some big-bad food we<br/>
HAVE TO eat.  <br/>
 <br/>

I have let it go for years and they still do NOT choose healthy <br/>
food over sugary/salty stuff. I find if I do not at least insist <br/>
they eat their protein and carbs at meal times (pretty much the only <br/>
things they will eat) they won&#39;t eat anything and go right to desert. <br/>
My dd is obsessed/addicted to sweets. How do I get out of this <br/>
cycle? Are you SURE that if I let them choose what they want to eat <br/>
that they will eventually pick healthy things? How long will this <br/>
take? And how do I get my son to try fruits and veggies etc.?? He <br/>
will not even put them in his mouth!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-172005402">***Do you believe it is wrong to NOT keep sweets in the<br/>
house? I make apples with a RAW almond butter honey<br/>
dip etc? BUt to not keep cake and cookies, even if<br/>
she asks for them?***<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s wrong but it might be problematic.<br/>
<br/>
Some people are not sweet eaters and it would be natural for them to have <br/>
few if any sweets in the house.<br/>
Some people are not meat eaters and so it would be natural for them to have <br/>
little or no meat on hand.<br/>
<br/>
When our kids are little we eat the way we eat and don&#39;t necessarily think <br/>
about introducing to them things we would not normally keep on hand.<br/>
<br/>
When our kids are older and especially old enough to ask questions about <br/>
food and be curious about what they see other people eating then I think <br/>
that&#39;s our cue to help them explore.   The way we do when our little babies <br/>
first show an interest in what we&#39;re eating; we offer them little tastes of <br/>
what we have.<br/>
<br/>
In a case where parents have strong feelings about a food like sweets and a <br/>
child is showing interest in those things (because she&#39;s seen other people <br/>
eat them or has been at a house where those things are abundant)  then I <br/>
think it&#39;s important to address the child&#39;s need to explore.   I don&#39;t think <br/>
that means filling the house with every possible sweet treat, but instead, <br/>
going about helping her try the thing she&#39;s asking about.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s likely that when we deny a thing a child is interested in, it <br/>
makes that thing seem more important - it creates more of a desire for that <br/>
thing.<br/>
<br/>
So, what if your child loves sweets?  What if she tries them and wants to <br/>
eat a lot of sweets?  Can you handle that?   Could you find a way to be ok <br/>
with that, maybe making homemade things with ingredients you feel better <br/>
about?<br/>
<br/>
Your child is going to try sweets.  She will be at a friends house someday <br/>
and they will offer something and she will try it.  You will not always be <br/>
in control of what she has access to.  She will be old enough one day to <br/>
walk to the store by herself and spend her money on something and that might <br/>
be candy.   So you can prevent her from having sweets now, if that&#39;s what <br/>
you want to do, but there will be a day she tries them for herself.<br/>
<br/>
It may or may not help you to ask yourself whether you feel it&#39;s right to <br/>
deny someone a thing they&#39;re interested in.  You might feel it&#39;s your duty <br/>
to protect her from foods you feel are not healthy.  There will be a point, <br/>
though where she will be making food choices for herself .  My feeling was <br/>
always that if Dylan had a lot of freedom to make choices he would learn to <br/>
make wise choices.  I believed it was better to have that learning <br/>
experience at home, with people who loved him and who could give him help <br/>
and advice than for him to be suddenly making choices for himself for the <br/>
first time when he was out on his own.<br/>
<br/>
If you are an example of healthy food choices yourself and if your daughter <br/>
has plenty of free access to healthy foods it&#39;s likely she will find a <br/>
balance that is near your own.  But it&#39;s possible she will at first choose a <br/>
lot of sweets if they are new and that might last longer than makes you <br/>
comfortable.  There is the possibility that she will always like sweets to a <br/>
degree you don&#39;t understand or share yourself.<br/>
<br/>
I do like sweets and I bake.  I don&#39;t eat commercially prepared cake mixes <br/>
or cookies but I make fudge and cake and cookies and sweet breads and candy <br/>
and pies.  I usually make something sweet every week.  I think chocolate <br/>
cake or nutmeg cookies are two of the finest breakfast choices available. <br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But my kid is not much of a sweet eater.  I find that strange because my <br/>
siblings are sweet eaters and David (dh) and his sibs are sweet eaters and I <br/>
thought Dylan had all the right genetics to make him a sweet eater.   It may <br/>
be that he just does not care a great deal about sweets or it may be that <br/>
having sweets available to him if he wanted them let him developed a <br/>
psychology that doesn&#39;t prize some food items above others.   I have heard <br/>
many similar stories from unschoolers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2085245438">I just got back from a short trip and found the house was out of food.  So today I loaded up my son (9) and took him to Publix.  He asked if he could bring his book in.  (He&#39;s currently reading the fourth Halo book and it&#39;s too good to put down.)  I told him sure if he wants, but we were here to buy his food, so he might be too busy shopping for reading.  The look he gave me was so precious!<br/>
   <br/>
  So I grabbed a cart and started asking if he liked this? or that? and so on.  As we went through the prepared food section, as I was looking at hummus, I noticed the cart slowly <br/>
  moving away. So I watched.  The cart sat in front of the fresh cheesecake and strawberry pies with a very bright eyed (hungry) young man looking hopeful at me.  I told him, &quot;Of course you may have it if you&#39;d like it.&quot;  He asked me if we had enough money.  I told him it was fine. Buy whatever you like today don&#39;t worry about the price. He never read his book and here is a quick list of his purchases (he bought enough for everyone, too!)<br/>
   <br/>
  Assorted dounuts<br/>
  egg drop soup<br/>
  hot & sour soup<br/>
  milk<br/>
  Orange juice<br/>
  grapes<br/>
  bananas<br/>
  cream of mushroom soup <br/>
  fruit loops<br/>
  cherry pie<br/>
  fried chicken<br/>
  SUSHI  &lt;need to repeat&gt; SUSHI<br/>
  ground beef for tacos <br/>
  Top sirloin<br/>
  cheesecake<br/>
  strawberry pie with whipped cream<br/>
   <br/>
  He is very full now and very happy, lol,  filled up on the sushi and hasn&#39;t touch a sweet yet.<br/>
  I love unschooling and the total concept behind it.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(Just so you know, I am not Adriana who had been posting about her son<br/>
and her brushing teeth - I disclaimer simply because in the past when no<br/>
distinction has been made, I&#39;ve been mixed up with people with another<br/>
similar name - with less than desirable results).  I am way cool with<br/>
unschooling philosophy and raising kids in freedom - I&#39;m the one who<br/>
talked about the fact that this year our kids wanted to decorate cookie<br/>
houses and I spent $20 on all the makings for it, and joined in the<br/>
making thereof with them.<br/>
<br/>
We meet all our kids wants and their needs.  We had the good fortune to<br/>
feed our children with a plethora of healthy natural food - we had a<br/>
mini garden as well as a neighbour who shared - before they really were<br/>
introduced to sugar.   So they had a foundation there.  I didn&#39;t think<br/>
of it as &quot;restrictive&quot; because our family just naturally happened to be<br/>
doing what we were doing.  It didn&#39;t occur to us that kids were<br/>
supposedly  &quot;missing out&quot; by us not having it.<br/>
<br/>
When it happened, we didn&#39;t make a big deal out of it, in fact we made<br/>
birthday cakes and stuff, and everything.  They know for themselves the<br/>
difference they feel.  That&#39;s why they never ask for it much.  When they<br/>
do, I&#39;ll bake cookies or something, or get them a candy.  We&#39;re<br/>
uncomfortable with the word &quot;restricting&quot; being applied to anything we<br/>
don&#39;t particularly go for with gusto. I have a lot of baggage with that<br/>
word.  They still like the taste of items made with sugar, and some<br/>
processed meals, but they always end up going for the things they love<br/>
best, which is what they&#39;ve been exposed to.<br/>
<br/>
Is there room for different lifestyles, and what people make more or<br/>
less abundant in their home that may differ from another&#39;s or less<br/>
mainstream, and still be able to call it unschooling?  Can people have<br/>
personal reasons for doing things a certain way, and still call it<br/>
unschooling?  For instance, can people who are vegetarian or vegan for<br/>
personal, environmental or ethical reasons still call themselves<br/>
&quot;unschoolers?&quot;  Can Jewish people be unschoolers?  ....<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s something I&#39;m a little timid about.  I just want to know if all<br/>
&quot;types&quot; are card-carrying unschoolers  according to the group here. :)<br/>
I ask this pleasantly, and positively, as I&#39;m eager to learn more.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-892928136">&quot;He lived to 4 3/4yo on breastmilk,&quot;...<br/>
<br/>
Kind of OT here, but I am curious...<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if you nurse, or pump, but I am sure he understands <br/>
where the milk comes from.<br/>
<br/>
I have a three month old and when I nurse him my daughter has asked <br/>
questions because we&#39;ve had a few situations where she has grabbed <br/>
or pinched someone elses breast (another mom usually) not meaning <br/>
anything by it, but I have told her no we don&#39;t touch other people <br/>
there. So in turn I think she has come to understand that we don&#39;t <br/>
touch other peoples private areas. Follow me so far? lol<br/>
<br/>
Okay so what I&#39;m trying to get at... when I am breastfeeding she <br/>
will give me odd looks like she is wondering &quot;why it&#39;s a private <br/>
place for others but its okay for me to lift my shirt and someone <br/>
else touches me there&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Then if I ask her what she is thinking, she will say &quot;nothing&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
How does your son react to it, or what do you say to him?  It&#39;s hard <br/>
for me to explain that to a three year old, so I&#39;m curious how you <br/>
would explain it to her?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to tell her the wrong thing and have her thinking it&#39;s <br/>
something gross or something you shouldn&#39;t be doing. It seems like <br/>
no matter how I put it will be the wrong thing to say.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard enough to nurse at ALL these days with the way people <br/>
treat you in public... let alone an older child where people think <br/>
you&#39;re being &quot;gross&quot; or inapropriate. I just don&#39;t want my daughter <br/>
to end up thinking the wrong thing about nursing.<br/>
<br/>
Any advice would be appreciated :)<br/>

prepare, but going and getting chips or candy isn&#39;t an option. If they&#39;re hungry they&#39;ll find <br/>
something on the plate that&#39;s worth eating. We say - &#39;take one bite of everything then eat <br/>
what you like.&#39; I too will warn them if there is something we&#39;re trying that&#39;s new that might <br/>
not go over - I need them to trust me and not feel tricked! But I don&#39;t agree that letting <br/>
them eat what they want when they want is a healthy way to go - I didn&#39;t care about my <br/>
diet until I was in my 30&#39;s! But I don&#39;t force stuff they hate either. One of mine hates fruit <br/>
too and I&#39;m encouraged from this last post that maybe he&#39;ll come around. We do &#39;juice <br/>
plus&#39; to try and fill in the many gaps in our diet but I think no boundries in this area is as <br/>
dangerous as too many. Middle ground works for us. <br/>

&gt; I rarely post here, mostly read messages ;-)  But, wanted to tell you<br/>
&gt; what we do. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I have a 5 yo. that *never* liked fruit.  I think the only fruit he<br/>
&gt; tasted as a fruit is a banana.  Other than that, even the purées I made<br/>
&gt; as a baby he gaged on  or showed distate to.  Veggies?  Well, except<br/>
&gt; mashed potatoes and corn-from-a-can, none other.  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; He lived to 4 3/4yo on breastmilk, cheerios, mashed potates, white rice,<br/>
&gt; ice cream, cheese, real apple juice and not much else I can think of.<br/>
&gt; He&#39;s never been pressured to taste, although I will ask him if he wants<br/>
&gt; to when I make something new, and as of the last month maybe, he started<br/>
&gt; answering &quot; What does it taste like?&quot;.  I give him the most honest<br/>
&gt; answer I have (with brother&#39;s sometimes chiming in) and he sometimes<br/>
&gt; chooses to try.  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; He started eating commercial fruit purées lately and loves those. I keep<br/>
&gt; a stash that I know he likes in arms reach.  And also, some puréed soups<br/>
&gt; are good.  Not everyone and not everytime.  But, he started asking for<br/>
&gt; some of these soups, so he likes them, I guess ;-)  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; So, don&#39;t pressure it, don&#39;t hide it, be honest about what&#39;s in it, and<br/>
&gt; find new meals to try.  Be patient, loving and open-minded about the<br/>
&gt; foods they choose.  Have them help making a meal.  Make the tomato sauce<br/>
&gt; for the pizza ;-)  Add pineapple.  Make yours special, add roasted<br/>
&gt; onions, olives, and offer them to take theirs and yours...  Show them<br/>
&gt; how veggies are part of the foods we eat and not some big-bad food we<br/>
&gt; HAVE TO eat.  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Genevieve, mom to 4 boys...<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have let it go for years and they still do NOT choose healthy <br/>
&gt; food over sugary/salty stuff. I find if I do not at least insist <br/>
&gt; they eat their protein and carbs at meal times (pretty much the only <br/>
&gt; things they will eat) they won&#39;t eat anything and go right to desert. <br/>
&gt; My dd is obsessed/addicted to sweets. How do I get out of this <br/>
&gt; cycle? Are you SURE that if I let them choose what they want to eat <br/>
&gt; that they will eventually pick healthy things? How long will this <br/>
&gt; take? And how do I get my son to try fruits and veggies etc.?? He <br/>
&gt; will not even put them in his mouth!<br/>

amen! after my first son had been weaned for quite  some time we were <br/>
carjacked and he went back to nursing (almost  instantly, as in *when we were filling <br/>
out the police report*) for 2  weeks. it was TRULY a blessing for him; <br/>
probably the only way he could  feel true comfort during such a scary time.<br/>

And your child has most likely picked up on your attitudes and will<br/>
not be perfectly honest about her desire to nurse (IF there is one) or<br/>
her curiosity about breasts. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s too bad that you see something natural and biological as<br/>
&quot;disgusting&quot;. YOu might want to examine those attitudes so you don&#39;t<br/>
close the door of learning in your childs face.<br/>

<br/>
My Mom did that whole &quot;no thank you bite&quot; crap.<br/>
I&#39;m sure glad to be an adult now, so I can choose what to put in my<br/>
mouth. Why make kids wait until their grown to decide what goes into<br/>
their bodies? Can you imagine if your dh made you eat foods you didn&#39;t<br/>
like. One bite is every bit as coercive as two. <br/>
<br/>
I know from experience that kids are WAY more likely to try new foods<br/>
when there&#39;s no pressure. They treat food like a scientist would.<br/>
<br/>
I was chopping cilantro tonight for salsa and Sierra stuck a piece in<br/>
her mouth. &quot;It doesn&#39;t taste like anything by itself&quot; she says. I ask<br/>
her if she ground it up good enough with her teeth because it&#39;s pretty<br/>
strong, so she tried it again and ended up spitting it out.:)<br/>
<br/>
She loved it in the salsa though.<br/>
All of my children will try weird foods at least once, out of<br/>
curiosity usually. There is no pressure. If they don&#39;t ever eat<br/>
certain foods will  it harm them? Of course not.<br/>
<br/>
And what a person doesn&#39;t like one year, they may like the next.<br/>
Tastes change drastically over time. Trevor (17) even likes sushi now<br/>
(he&#39;s got pretty American tastes most of the time).<br/>

<br/>
Not my original post, but I just wanted to give an opinion.<br/>
<br/>
When my dd makes me one of her playdoh &quot;meals&quot; or cooks me something <br/>
in her pretend kitchen I always sit down and pretend to eat it with <br/>
her. I figure she spend alot of time and effort making it, and I <br/>
respect that.<br/>
<br/>
Respect is a big thing in our house. And we do the same thing. All I <br/>
ask of my kids is to try it. I spent time and effort making that <br/>
meal and all I expect in return is that you try it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to live my life as a partner with my kids, not as a <br/>
dictator. I still tell them to try things because they tell me to <br/>
try what they made. Thats fair and respectful to me.<br/>
<br/>
You know that they say... &quot;Give a little, get a little.&quot; :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My daughters, 6 and 4 yrs old, sometimes do that. Out of curiosity. They say they want to see whether there&#39;s still milk inside. It&#39;s maybe a second, and they like to do it together.<br/>
Finally tandem-nursing! ;) (Which I didn&#39;t want to do back then.)<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s see, Betty does this 4 years, and Jenny 2 years after really nursing... It comes up occasionally, like now that my sister has a baby and is nursing her.<br/>
<br/>
Simply pulling up my shirt and touching is something they like to do, too. And I just tell them whether it&#39;s okay for me at the moment, or not.<br/>
<br/>
I frankly don&#39;t know if I would do it like this with a boy, don&#39;t have one so far ;), but I&#39;m actually happy that they as future women like and enjoy breasts! And are looking forward to having some themselves!<br/>

once it was gone, it was gone.<br/>

Then again I havent had much chance for mine to BE gone... so I <br/>

I nursed my three year old till about 18 months and at the time I <br/>

later. Then I nursed her until  11 months (my son was born when she <br/>

about three and a half years of nursing, so I really havent had the <br/>

Is it just your hormones that stimulate it to come back in?<br/>

cheese or milk, she doesn&#39;t like the bitter taste, the lactic acid taste. As <br/>
a child I was allergic to milk, she may have some of that going on. I&#39;ve <br/>
never really liked tomatoes and when I was travelling with two of my <br/>
professors to watch their children as they rode RAGBRAI and we were eating <br/>
spaghetti meals every night I ended up with a mouth full of mouth ulcers. I <br/>
probably had a low level allergy to the acid in tomatoes. Or not, maybe I <br/>
just didn&#39;t like them, but I felt like I was a failure for not liking them. <br/>
I felt like I was stupid and entrenched in my views for not liking them. <br/>
Like it was a choice. So, when you are telling your child that they must eat <br/>
something, they must try something, than you are telling them that you know <br/>
them better than they do, that there is no legitimate reason for their not <br/>
trying something and that even if it is something that they know they will <br/>
hate their knowledge is founded on nothing and they shouldn&#39;t trust <br/>
themselves. It is a powerful message.<br/>

&gt; ~~&gt;&gt;We say - &#39;take one bite of everything then eat what you like.&gt;&gt;&gt;~~<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My Mom did that whole &quot;no thank you bite&quot; crap.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m sure glad to be an adult now, so I can choose what to put in my<br/>
&gt; mouth. Why make kids wait until their grown to decide what goes into<br/>
&gt; their bodies? Can you imagine if your dh made you eat foods you didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; like. One bite is every bit as coercive as two.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know from experience that kids are WAY more likely to try new foods<br/>
&gt; when there&#39;s no pressure. They treat food like a scientist would.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was chopping cilantro tonight for salsa and Sierra stuck a piece in<br/>
&gt; her mouth. &quot;It doesn&#39;t taste like anything by itself&quot; she says. I ask<br/>
&gt; her if she ground it up good enough with her teeth because it&#39;s pretty<br/>
&gt; strong, so she tried it again and ended up spitting it out.:)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; She loved it in the salsa though.<br/>
&gt; All of my children will try weird foods at least once, out of<br/>
&gt; curiosity usually. There is no pressure. If they don&#39;t ever eat<br/>
&gt; certain foods will  it harm them? Of course not.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And what a person doesn&#39;t like one year, they may like the next.<br/>
&gt; Tastes change drastically over time. Trevor (17) even likes sushi now<br/>
&gt; (he&#39;s got pretty American tastes most of the time).<br/>

&gt; That&#39;s something I&#39;m a little timid about.  I just want to know if all<br/>
&gt; &quot;types&quot; are card-carrying unschoolers  according to the group here. :)<br/>
&gt; I ask this pleasantly, and positively, as I&#39;m eager to learn more.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are no cards. And the list isn&#39;t meant to be a social group so  <br/>
there isn&#39;t a requirement for how closely someone follows the advice.  <br/>
(There are other lists for people who only want to network and  <br/>
socialize with others who self-identify as unschoolers.)<br/>
<br/>
Think of the list as an information resource. It&#39;s a place to get  <br/>
advice on *unschooling* ways to get unschooling running more  <br/>
smoothly. (As opposed to advice on how to compromise to make parents  <br/>
more comfortable with unschooling.)<br/>
<br/>
Some will take most of the advice. Some will take some of the advice.<br/>
<br/>
Some people will take the unschooling advice for academics and  <br/>
maintain more traditional parenting. Some will take the unschooling  <br/>
advice for everything but religion or math or food or bedtimes.<br/>
<br/>
But the list is set up for unschoolers to help people who want to  <br/>
apply the principles of unschooling in their homes and are seeking  <br/>
the advice on how to put those principles into practice. The list  <br/>
isn&#39;t for people who are seeking (or offering) advice on how to mesh  <br/>
unschooling with traditional schooling or parenting. But unschoolers  <br/>
here can help people who want to deal with the fears that make  <br/>
someone want to unschool part way. It&#39;s not for advice on how to make  <br/>
kids read the Torah or the Bible when they&#39;re trusting their kids to  <br/>
learn everything else by living. But unschoolers here can help people  <br/>
who want to know how other unschoolers have managed to unschool what  <br/>
seems to be un-unschoolable.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s happened -- in a big flurry for some reason! -- is many new  <br/>
people are telling others why they have no intention of taking the  <br/>
advice or doing any such thing.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not what the list is for. It *is* though for people to say and  <br/>
ask, &quot;That makes me uncomfortable. How can you make that work?  <br/>
Doesn&#39;t xxx happen?&quot;<br/>
