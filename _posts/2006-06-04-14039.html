<div id="ygrps-yiv-380458352">**What one friend told me (and my parents too) was that I&#39;m doing my kids a <br/>
grave disservice by not forcing them into a few activities. I&#39;ve offered, we do <br/>
stuff on our own, but no one really has that desire right now.**<br/>
<br/>
I tell people that I don&#39;t put my kids into any activities until they BEG. <br/>
:-) It&#39;s not strictly true, but it expresses well my attitude that this idea of <br/>
scheduling activities for kids &quot;for their own good&quot; is entirely the wrong way <br/>
to go about helping them into the world.<br/>
<br/>
It also expresses my experience that eventually every one of my kids has <br/>
wanted to do things that stretched every bit of me in helping them find a way <br/>
toward their desired activity. They each at one time or another strongly wanted to <br/>
do things that were hard to locate, or hard to afford, or required massive <br/>
time commitments from both the child and a chauffeuring parent, or...  Saving up <br/>
my energy to help them do those important to them things was a much better <br/>
use of my life than spending it pushing them into activities that didn&#39;t <br/>
interest them just for the sake of having them in something.<br/>
