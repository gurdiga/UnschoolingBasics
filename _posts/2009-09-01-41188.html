<div id="ygrps-yiv-229594977">Hi Stephanie,<br/>
<br/>
What your husband is asking for is a tall order. Even if ds was in school<br/>
they don&#39;t expect children to really read until 8. Each child will learn<br/>
when THEY are ready, regardless of some one else&#39;s schedule. People learn,<br/>
no one teaches them. You can light the way for them to discover new things<br/>
and find information.<br/>
<br/>
Most people recommend at leat one month per year the children were in school<br/>
as time to deschool. One month of you (and dh) letting go of school. Take<br/>
some time and read, search the archives on here, read Sandra Dodd&#39;s and<br/>
Joyce Fetterol&#39;s site. Ask lots of questions, we answer them :-). Spend huge<br/>
amounts of time observing your kids without directing them. If they are<br/>
interested in something support it. If they want something help them find a<br/>
way to get it. If they ask a question answer it (if you don&#39;t know the<br/>
answer look it up). BE there for them. Many find it helpful to really learn<br/>
about unschooling before they get the kids involved.<br/>
<br/>
Does you husband like to read? Would he like to listen to people speak?<br/>
There are great audio downloads available on the Live and Learn site<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://liveandlearnshop.com/catalog/index.php?main_page=index&cPath=32_34_38">http://liveandlearnshop.com/catalog/index.php?main_page=index&cPath=32_34_38</a><br/>
<br/>
There are all kinds of local unschooling groups in many parts of the<br/>
country. Sandra&#39;s site has a list of many of them. Find IRL (in real life)<br/>
people to connect with is really amazing.<br/>
<br/>
best wishes,<br/>
Faith<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1383540278"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; He wants our 6 year old reading by Thanksgiving.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unfortunately reading can&#39;t be taught. Neither can walking. Neither  <br/>
can bike riding.<br/>
<br/>
I know that is counter to what the mainstream says and believes about  <br/>
reading.<br/>
<br/>
(Though even if I were a nut case, no school would guarantee a 6 yo  <br/>
reading by Thanksgiving. Teachers know that&#39;s not possible for every  <br/>
6 yo.)<br/>
<br/>
Reading and walking and bike riding each require several brain areas  <br/>
to mature in order to coordinate a lot of different actions. Walking  <br/>
and bike riding involve muscle coordination, balance, vision, and who  <br/>
knows what else to all be working together in a specific way. Until  <br/>
that happens, all the instruction in the world will just likely make  <br/>
the child feel like there&#39;s something wrong with them when in reality  <br/>
their brains just aren&#39;t ready.<br/>
<br/>
Reading is much more complex than it looks. (Though simpler for kids  <br/>
to puzzle out that it seems it should be!) Reading is more than just  <br/>
learning what letter makes what sound and putting them together with  <br/>
a few rules about exceptions. If it were that simple, schools would  <br/>
have perfected the instruction long ago! In that way it&#39;s like  <br/>
walking and bike riding. You can explain and show but what actually  <br/>
works is kids figuring it out on their own.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooled children learn to read -- without instruction -- in the  <br/>
same age range as schooled kids, typically between 6 and 8. That&#39;s  <br/>
when the brain areas needed for decoding typically develop. It also  <br/>
happens to coincide with reading instruction so it appears that  <br/>
reading instruction is responsible for kids reading but since  <br/>
unschooled kids are reading at the same ages it can&#39;t be the  <br/>
instruction. It&#39;s age and being surrounded by the written word.<br/>
<br/>
While schools &quot;require&quot; all kids be reading by 4th grade, the truth  <br/>
is they aren&#39;t. The kids who aren&#39;t reading are shuttled off to  <br/>
special instruction. But no matter how gently that is done, kids can  <br/>
end up demoralized and feeling stupid. Or, for self preservation,  <br/>
deciding reading is stupid.<br/>
<br/>
The advantage unschoolers have is that our kids learn when they&#39;re  <br/>
developmentally ready without the demoralization. And if they&#39;re  <br/>
older when they first start reading, they&#39;re quickly reading at age  <br/>
level and are indistinguishable from kids who were reading years  <br/>
earlier.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1133934188">Well, it&#39;s not as if you are going to try to prevent the boy from reading, are you? :)<br/>
<br/>
And when Dad reads to him, he can see what sort of grasp your son has. What sort of progress he makes. <br/>
<br/>
And he will. It may not be a straight line and it may not be on a schedule of someone else&#39;s choosing, but he will go through all the normal stages of learning to read.<br/>
<br/>
Dad can help him by telling him words he doesn&#39;t know when they are reading together, playing with the alphabet, etc. Enjoy a bunch of silly Dr. Seuss or other good books together. See what the boy likes and urge Dad to do more of that. <br/>
<br/>
And let Dad know that whether someone can read is kind of vague. Does he recognize letters and know they represent sounds? Can he recognize some words? Can he read a simple Bob book? Can he read chapter books? Can he write anything? (Around here, writing came long after reading, btw.) <br/>
<br/>
If your son is ready and interested, reading will happen if you and DH make it part of his life. He can&#39;t read them if you don&#39;t have books around. But there&#39;s a lot of reading in the world -- games and online and comics and signs, etc. <br/>
<br/>
If your son has a preference, there&#39;s also no &quot;unschooling rule&quot; about  using a curriculum. I never did with DS but DD demanded one. We used the &quot;100 Easy Lessons&quot; book. She didn&#39;t think she could read at all -- and was quite ticked that everyone else could :) -- but it turned out she could already read the first 1/3 of the book and so we did the middle 1/3 and by that time she was reading small books on her own (which is what she counted as &quot;reading&quot;). <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-186772911">I might suggest that you sit down with hubby (in a calm, quiet time and<br/>
place and attitude) and ask for more information. Does he want DS to be<br/>
able to recognize his name, address, etc? Know the alphabet in order? Be<br/>
able to handle &quot;The cat sat on the mat&quot; type stuff? Being &quot;able to read&quot;<br/>
can mean a lot of things, different to different people. In school, if a<br/>
child can sound out &quot;c-a-t&quot;, they are &quot;beginning to read&quot;. However, in<br/>
most home/un schooling circles, you&#39;ll likely hear that kids are<br/>
&quot;reading&quot; when they are actually able to fluently and independently<br/>
handle the symbolic language involved in gathering printed information<br/>
that they need. Oh, and there&#39;s also the difference between reading<br/>
aloud and reading to one&#39;s self - two DIFFERENT processes involved so<br/>
one may be able to silently zoom through Harry Potter, one might also<br/>
have trouble reading this paragraph aloud. Reading is not an end in<br/>
itself; it is a tool, just as a hammer is a tool. It&#39;s one of several<br/>
means of gathering information.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Just a guess, but it sounds like DH may be feeling external pressure<br/>
from family, coworkers, etc.<br/>

<br/>
Unfortunately, there isn&#39;t one set of &quot;normal stages&quot; when it comes to learning to read. Some kids go through a set of stages where they puzzle out letter-sound combinations, but not all. Some kids jump right to reading short phrases and sentences without knowing being able to read single words! And still others read by a process that&#39;s so subtle it looks like magic. If dad is expecting &quot;normal stages&quot; he may be frustrated by a kid who learns via another route - and could draw the conclusion that his child isn&#39;t learning to read at all! <br/>

<br/>
Ultimatums get in the way of joyful learning and relationships in general. If it&#39;s so important to him, he should be the one working with your child. He doesn&#39;t have the right to put that on you. He couldn&#39;t put that on a teacher in school.<br/>

I believe teaching is damaging to the learning process. This list exists to help you move away from teaching and towards trust. We can&#39;t give you curriculum or teaching suggestions. We can only help you move towards unschooling, not schooling at home.<br/>
<br/>
Phonetic style would have been  horrible for my child that learned to read at 12. He didn&#39;t learn that way and it may have convinced him he wasn&#39;t &quot;smart&quot;. <br/>
