Hi  all.  I want to post real quick to clarify that I am not the one   <br/>
who said anything snarky<br/>
about this list.  I don&#39;t know if anybody  thought that, but since I  <br/>
was the one who started a<br/>
thread that  lead to some discussion of porn and kids running in the  <br/>
street, I  just want to<br/>
make sure no one thinks that poster on another list is  me.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, thank you to everyone who continued dialoguing with me  on  <br/>
my topic.  I really am<br/>
getting a lot from everyone, and  do wish to continue the dialogue.  I  <br/>
spent almost four  hours<br/>
that one night replying to everyone, and I just can&#39;t take the  time  <br/>
to do that again just yet.  I<br/>
hope you&#39;ll still be open  to continuing when I can get to it.<br/>
<br/>

*I* know it wasn&#39;t you - as I mentioned in a post t you ;) It&#39;s ok, and  that <br/>
was really nice of you to comment and mention this. <br/>
 <br/>
Take care! <br/>
We are ALL learning, Maura...but I think you know that ;) <br/>
