<div id="ygrps-yiv-1546169165">Hi, I&#39;m Cheryl from upstate NY, mom to two daughters, Andrea (almost<br/>
12) and Jessa (9). We attended the NEU Conference last weekend (and<br/>
met Ren -- hi, Ren!). We&#39;ve been unschooling/homeschooling for five<br/>
years, but this was our first time attending an unschooling<br/>
conference. If only I had attended a conference in the beginning! <br/>
<br/>
A little bit of our history: We began homeschooling after checking out<br/>
the Albany Free School as an alternative to public school for our<br/>
older daughter when she was in first grade. I immediately loved the<br/>
concept of unschooling, and thought, &quot;We can do this at home!&quot; And so<br/>
we did. The first year we spent totally deschooling. The next year,<br/>
and the years following, I added curriculum. What grief I could have<br/>
saved myself and my family if I had seen more real, live RUing<br/>
families in action (as opposed to an RUing school)! We&#39;ve met lots of<br/>
homeschoolers over the years, but the majority of them do school at<br/>
home. RU, however, is where my heart has always been. And now that<br/>
I&#39;ve seen it in action with such intensity, and seen examples of so<br/>
many wonderful children, teenagers and unschooling families, I feel<br/>
set free in several ways!<br/>
<br/>
Since the conference I&#39;ve noticed that I no longer feel the need to<br/>
convince mainstream-minded people that our family is doing &quot;school at<br/>
home.&quot; If they want to believe that, fine, but I won&#39;t lie and say<br/>
we&#39;re doing things we aren&#39;t. I feel more comfortable correcting<br/>
people (especially family) when they ask assumption-loaded questions.<br/>
And I let their shock or disapproving silence roll off my back.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also noticed that it no longer makes me so uncomfortable to be<br/>
around teachers or families who talk about nothing but school. I&#39;ve<br/>
come to terms with the fact that I simply don&#39;t want that life for my<br/>
children. If others want it for theirs, that&#39;s fine, but I&#39;ve grown<br/>
much more comfortable in my own shoes!<br/>
<br/>
The conference has given me a picture of unschooling as a *normal* way<br/>
of living. It doesn&#39;t seem like such a freak alternative for weirdos<br/>
anymore. I&#39;ve seen firsthand that there are plenty of families doing<br/>
it, and that they are some of the most amazing, interesting, open, and<br/>
warm people alive!<br/>
<br/>
The girls were dreading the conference before we went, but they had a<br/>
blast and can&#39;t wait for the next one (we plan on attending Live and<br/>
Learn in the fall). To anyone who was at the NEUC -- thanks for being<br/>
so open and sharing with your lives. It was truly an unforgettable and<br/>
life altering experience.<br/>
