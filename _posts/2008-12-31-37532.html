<div id="ygrps-yiv-595301130">perhaps ask them to help clean up the mess and maybe it will help them remember not to levae chairs around?  If they refuse let them know you will do it, but not enjoy it and it amy make you too tired to do something fun later.  I don&#39;t claim to know it all, I am still learning every day too.<br/>

yet. It&#39;s like getting mad at an 12 mo who can&#39;t walk yet. Your  <br/>
steaming won&#39;t make them walk or not leave chairs.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s your responsibility to keep the youngest safe, not your kids.  <br/>
Talk to your kids about other solutions. Stick to the original  <br/>
problem: keeping dangerous things away from the youngest. Don&#39;t try  <br/>
to fix the kids so they put chairs away. That&#39;s not the problem!<br/>
<br/>
The most obvious thing is don&#39;t keep the dangerous, messy things  <br/>
where the kids go to get other things. Reorganize things.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-893173550">Diana,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much for this post.  I&#39;m in tears reading your post and the<br/>
link.  I&#39;m still not sure where this unschooling journey will lead us, but I<br/>
know that I am ever grateful for those 3 children downstairs from whom I&#39;m<br/>
currently escaping (Dad is with them) and that though my problems and stress<br/>
is very real, nothing is more important than them, so I am going downstairs<br/>
and hugging each one of them and telling them how much I love them.  I&#39;m<br/>
starting with this moment.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you and Happy New Year!!!!<br/>

Thanks! This was very helpful ..not only in dealing with it but know that others get angry, annoyed, stressed etc even when they want to do better. <br/>
<br/>
At that moment I didn&#39;t say anything to her about it other than ...there is broken glass out here can you hang out in your room a few minutes? maybe start a movie ...which they did and I brought them some popcorn and coco. ...and I took a few minutes to inventory the situation . Ok broken glass , mess no biggie . how much did he swallow ..estimated to be about 3 doses ..hrmm b-12 water soluble vitamin don&#39;t want it to happen again but he will be fine. <br/>
<br/>
I feel so guilty when I&#39;m angry at my kids though esp when its just really not that big of a deal. <br/>

My first reaction to this was well duh! of course its not their responsibility . Of course the out of place chair isn&#39;t the problem. Its not the problem ..then why am i steaming? Because I&#39;m stressed about finances, paying back a huge amount in student loans dh took out , Nate&#39;s Dr bills , because , because , because ..but NOT because of a chair or a sweet 9 year old girl. <br/>
<br/>
Then dh came home and said Ill go buy some sort of locking box tomorrow and Courtney said well if I were Nate Id have the hardest time getting to it back in your bathroom on the high cabinet. She&#39;s right so medicines, vitamins, etc got moved back there. <br/>

Ulterior motives are a good thing to let go of, though. It sets kids  <br/>

Think about it this way. If your husband asked if you wanted to help  <br/>
reroof the house and you knew he wouldn&#39;t be disappointed if you said  <br/>
no, you could freely say<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yes!&quot;<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t mind holding the ladder or handing you shingles but I don&#39;t  <br/>
want to be on the roof.&quot;<br/>
&quot;I was about to cook dinner.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But if he said &quot;I&#39;ll do it, but I won&#39;t enjoy it and it might make me  <br/>
too tired to do something later,&quot; how would you feel?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it&#39;s slightly different since you weren&#39;t responsible for  <br/>
ripping off the roof shingles ;-) but it&#39;s really mom that wants the  <br/>
chairs put away and the mess cleaned up. That&#39;s her deal and the kids  <br/>
will be baffled if she treats the event as if it were their mess to  <br/>
clean up. Just as you wouldn&#39;t get it if your husband decided the  <br/>
roof belonged to you and he was going to the trouble to take care of  <br/>
your roof.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

reading to examine ideas sent to the list so new unschoolers can see  <br/>
why what sounds reasonable to the parents doesn&#39;t work the way they  <br/>
think it should. It&#39;s because the kids see the situation from a very  <br/>
different perspective and they react from their perspective, not from  <br/>
the parents&#39; perspective. We can&#39;t force an adult perspective on kids  <br/>
by insisting they see it our way.  They will eventually grow into an  <br/>
adult perspective. But while they&#39;re kids we&#39;ll whittle away at our  <br/>
relationships if we cling to our perspective instead of shifting to  <br/>
theirs and seeing the world through their eyes.<br/>

<br/>
Your actions weren&#39;t &quot;angry&quot; though (from what you wrote) and that&#39;s <br/>
important.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes my thoughts get stuck in a &quot;loop&quot; - I&#39;ll replay something <br/>
over and over and over and over... waaaaaay past the point of problem <br/>
solving a better solution for next time. I used to then feel crummy <br/>
about being stuck in that &quot;loop&quot; - what&#39;s wrong with me? why can&#39;t I <br/>
move on? But I&#39;ve come to realize that its part of my process. If I <br/>
can remind myself Gently &quot;move on&quot; (and even better, find a new <br/>
direction) then I will move on, more quickly and easily than if I <br/>
beat myself up over being stuck. But I have to keep in mind that I&#39;m <br/>
sure to go through the &quot;loop&quot; a few more times even after I remind <br/>
myself to move on, regardless. Keeping in mind that this is how my <br/>
process works is important to helping me be gentle with myself. <br/>
<br/>
Did that make sense or did I manage to talk in circles?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t find it helpful to have this kind of assumption wrt asking my <br/>
kids for help. I *do* ask my kids for help when I want some help, and <br/>
when they aren&#39;t too terribly busy - but their assistance is a gift. <br/>
I don&#39;t expect my kids to learn some kind of lesson from it.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That sort of message is more about guilt than real life consequences. <br/>
Picking up a bunch of stuff in the kitchen isn&#39;t likely to make me so <br/>
tired that I won&#39;t want to play with my kids later - its an <br/>
unrealistic prediction and kids see through that. They&#39;ll know its a <br/>
guilt trip. <br/>
<br/>
That being said, my kids and I talk about personal energy levels <br/>
pretty regularly. They&#39;re both more energetic in the evening than I <br/>
am! So there are plenty of times when we&#39;ve deferred a fun activity <br/>
to anther day, or found a way to do it that didn&#39;t involve as much <br/>
running or jumping on my part ;)<br/>
