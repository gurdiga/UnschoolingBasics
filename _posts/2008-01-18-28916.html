<div id="ygrps-yiv-1433968381">Hi, all. My name is Laura. I have two children, a six year-old<br/>
daughter and a four year-old son. We are new to unschooling, and new<br/>
to the formal concept of gentle parenting. We were very AP when the<br/>
kids were small. We co-slept, nursed on demand, I wore the babies in<br/>
slings and Baby Bjorns...then I seemed to lose patience with them as<br/>
they got older. I had no idea how to handle their emerging<br/>
personalities, and most of the advice I received involved control,<br/>
punishment and rewards. We started spanking for practically every<br/>
little &quot;offense&quot;, and I was very controlling with them. Our<br/>
relationship was (understandably) very strained for over a year, with<br/>
lots of whining, hurting and YELLING, unfortunately. I am not sure how<br/>
I went from such a gentle mama to an angry, scary mama, but I did. It<br/>
did not help to have other moms at church telling me that The Rod is<br/>
the only way to get your kids to OBEY, and other ideas along those lines. <br/>
<br/>
I am now starting down a path of healing our relationships, and I am<br/>
reading everything I can get my hands on about unschooling. Being a<br/>
member at AlwaysUnschooled has been very eye opening. I&#39;ve let go of<br/>
having to control everything that my kids see or do, and they&#39;ve been<br/>
much happier, more affectionate, they are thriving, really. We&#39;ve<br/>
rediscovered DVDs and computer games, and I&#39;ve pretty much shelved all<br/>
of the workbooks we used religiously. I&#39;ve also rediscovered the<br/>
gentle mama that I had been when they were little. <br/>
<br/>
So I look forward to learning from all of you, and feel privileged to<br/>
have access to some of unschooling&#39;s pioneers. Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-534189787">Welcome Laura, I am also new to unschooling.  I&#39;ve been reading on this group and others for at least a couple of years (on and off) and with the new year I&#39;ve just made the full jump into unschooling!  This is an awesome group of unschoolers.  And with the yelling and angry momma syndrome -- I can totally relate.  I just had a whole weeks worth of discussion, soul searching, etc with the other group I belong to of unschoolers in michigan.  Whew, changing can be hard but we must do it for our own selves and our children! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-273289331">Hi, Laura - <br/>
<br/>
Welcome! I&#39;ve been thinking lately on why AP when they&#39;re small, that<br/>
seems to come SO easily (at least it did for me), doesn&#39;t always<br/>
transition to gentle parenting/consensual living/radical unschooling<br/>
when they&#39;re older. I&#39;m still mulling it over, it&#39;ll probably be a<br/>
blog entry one day, but just last night I was thinking so much of it<br/>
has to do with who&#39;s around us, and the type of parenting support we<br/>
receive.<br/>
<br/>
Damn! Saying that just gave me a HUGE rush of appreciation for those<br/>
RU parents who were RU before the internet. I&#39;m guessing there were<br/>
some! lol I SO rely on groups like this to provide the safety net<br/>
around me. I know there was Growing Without Schooling, and a whole<br/>
community around that magazine. It&#39;s hard for me to imagine what that<br/>
would have looked like. Anyone written about that?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - I was definitely AP, but like you, began moving away from<br/>
that as my son aged. But -- reluctantly! I knew in my heart I wanted a<br/>
different way to parent, to be. But everyone in my support group here<br/>
(mostly La Leche League parents) were &quot;moving on&quot;, putting their kids<br/>
in preschool, handing out harsher and harsher consequences for<br/>
&quot;misbehavior&quot;. I was still *mostly* a gentle parent, but if you think<br/>
you&#39;re supposed to be making your kid do something they don&#39;t want to<br/>
do, you&#39;re going to be mean, eventually. I *wanted* to follow Evan&#39;s<br/>
lead, but *no one* around me was living that way, and I heard over and<br/>
over how I&#39;d ruin his life if I didn&#39;t &quot;parent&quot; him differently. So I<br/>
began mistrusting my gut.<br/>
<br/>
Well - never again! After 1st and 2nd grades at a charter school, we<br/>
found unschooling, which led to radical unschooling. I wonder if I<br/>
hadn&#39;t had a computer at home, where we&#39;d be? No need to dwell there!<br/>
<br/>
I was very touched by your e-mail. I&#39;m so glad you found AU, and this<br/>
group as well. I look forward to hearing about your journey.<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-564010731">Hi, Laura! <br/>
 <br/>
I hope you feel good about your changes - you are making such important  <br/>
strides forward. That is challenging and brave! What a wonderful thing to show  <br/>
your children - courage and strength to feel and use your gut. <br/>
 <br/>
Read all the women&#39;s blogs/pages here. They are FULL of simplicity (it is  <br/>
simple, just not always easy when you come from such a stronghold  especially)  <br/>
and love and direction and support - and full of helping you  to trust <br/>
yourself and your kids. I use Joyce&#39;s (Fetteroll, though I may have  spelled her last <br/>
name wrong!) regularly, and Sandra Dodd&#39;s, among others. Dayna  Martin is a <br/>
good one to try out, too :) Also, The Natural Parenting Project may  be one <br/>
you&#39;d like. I know too of a bunch of Radical Unschooling Christian sites  and No <br/>
Spank sites too - biblically and otherwise based. <br/>
 <br/>
enjoy the ride! It&#39;s the journey, not the destination, right :) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-684213168">Hi, I&#39;ve been reading all the posts (I wouldn&#39;t miss them for the world!) and they are so helpful, so insightful, so confirming that I&#39;m on the right track for my kids and for our family.  I LOVE the Abraham Hicks quote!  I am also part of an AP yahoo group here in Calgary, and it&#39;s amazing how the thinking kind of just stops when kids hit around 3, when their &quot;attitude&quot; starts and people start choosing traditional discipline over their hearts.<br/>
   <br/>
  That thought is the reason I&#39;m writing really.  I love what I read about giving our children freedom, and I&#39;m all for it to keep them away from school and let them direct their learning, but I haven&#39;t read much about the years before - up to age 5 or so I guess, or perhaps even 4.  My girls are 3 and a bit right now and life just feels hard most days.  They are very busy, very opinionated, very determined, very self-sufficient, and while these are all qualities that I admire and that I know will serve them very well throughout their lives (so I have no desire to change them), I still feel like I&#39;m parenting much like I was parented, minus the spanking.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;m guess I&#39;m learning that unschooling is so much more than just keeping my kids out of school, and yet I don&#39;t really know what that looks like.  I would SO love to hang out at Sandra&#39;s house, or Joyce&#39;s house, or Ren&#39;s house, just to get a feel for what the days are like.  I still have this picture of kids running amok with no order whatsoever and the parents going nuts, but that&#39;s so different that what I&#39;m hearing.  I&#39;ve also read detailed emails about people&#39;s days, and I&#39;m still coming up short!  Is this part of my own deschooling process to feel so confused and unsure??  My heart says this is so aligned with everything I&#39;m really about underneath all my years of conditioning, but I don&#39;t really know what to do next.  I want someone on my shoulder to tell me!!!<br/>
   <br/>
  I want to know about how other unschoolers get their 3 year old wired up tired kids to go to bed, I want to know what mealtimes look like, I want to know how you get them to put their coats on, etc. when you have somewhere you have to be, I just feel so out of my element and like letting it all flow is a little scary and I feel powerless and out of control in my own house letting the girls decide so much for themselves.<br/>
   <br/>
  Please help! :o)<br/>
   <br/>
  Thank you from my heart,<br/>
   <br/>

<br/>
___________________<br/>
 <br/>
Ok, I&#39;ll break it down. I have a 5 year old son and a 2 year old daughter  <br/>
I&#39;ve been unschooling since the start, and 3 big kids that I didn&#39;t at ALL until <br/>
 just almost 2 years ago for the 18 year old and since Nov. for the 15 year <br/>
old.  The 20 year old no longer lives at home with me. <br/>
 <br/>
bedtime: my kids love routine. so, we eat dinner at around 5, watch tv at  <br/>
the same time usually (we are all into bindi the jungle girl right now!), and i  <br/>
turn on the dim lights we have. then, by around 6, we head off to the bath,  <br/>
where we&#39;ll have a bubble bath, or play with toys we froze into ice <br/>
containers,  or some such thing. then after a warm and cozy bath, we get on jammies, <br/>
watch an  episode of peep and the big wide world, lol, with the lights off, <br/>
cuddling, then  julian goes to play a video game with papa while i nurse julia to <br/>
sleep (around  7), then we switch, and julian comes up by 8ish, and io nurse <br/>
him to sleep. <br/>
 <br/>
the routine we have is flexible, of course, and its changed a lot over the  <br/>
course of the 5 years julian&#39;s been here :) but since my kids do really well  <br/>
with routine (not structure), this has been really good for us. really, its <br/>
just  looking for their cues as they become tired, and supporting that by <br/>
softening  the lights and staying regular - not all kids of course are like this, but <br/>
we  can all follow our children&#39;s cues. noticing them and responding to them <br/>
is the  biggest step (vs an imposed bedtime, we work with their body clock, <br/>
which is  very much like the sun clock).<br/>
 <br/>
Jackets - well, we live in calif., in the southern part, so its not often  <br/>
needed, but i keep jackets in the car, tell them or show them what the weather  <br/>
is like and then make sure there is time - and lots of it - to discuss the <br/>
coat,  the weather, if we need one or want one, the bird that just flew by, if <br/>
its cold  up in that airplane, lol, you get the idea. lots of time, give as much <br/>
as  possible all the time, so when you *are* rushed, they know they are heard <br/>
at  other times and it all seems to balance out. patience, time, enjoy each <br/>
bit of  it as much as you can - it helps sooo much, as the kids know their <br/>
needs and  wants are just as important as yours. <br/>
 <br/>
mealtimes...lol...um, we do eat in a more routine manner than some  families, <br/>
i&#39;m sure, but we are complicated by 2 young adult kids that have heavy  <br/>
social priorities and my dh, who has only semi-regular hours. we work best with  <br/>
this &quot;method&quot;: I make one main meal like thing a day that works for lunch or  <br/>
dinner, and the big kids and DH eat that, along with myself. If the little ones  <br/>
like it, they eat it too, of course, but Julian is very discerning at this  <br/>
point, so dinners for the kids is usually a bit different. But we have <br/>
breakfast  of cereals or toast and juice, once in a while, if they ask, ice cream :)  <br/>
Pumpkin pie is a GREAT breakfast - eat your veggies! lol! they usually want to <br/>
 eat within an hour of waking up, and they wake around 7 usually. I make a  <br/>
midmorning snack for them, usually fruit or crackers, or both, and then we eat <br/>
a  lunch around 1. That is often quesadillas, or hotdogs, raw veggies, fish or <br/>
 chicken, and often it&#39;s the biggest meal of the day. Dinner, as I said <br/>
above,  around 5, and varies from oatmeal to cold cereal, to a huge, traditional <br/>
thing.  Homemade pizza is a big one here, too, for all meals :) <br/>
 <br/>
If you are feeling apprehensive about giving them so much control so fast,  <br/>
go more slowly. Say yes as often as possible, just a few times more a day. <br/>
Allow  for time and talking and exploring things.  Look over what they eat after a <br/>
 week, not per meal or per day even. Maybe even a month. Read a lot of stuff <br/>
on  this style of being, listen a lot, ask tons of questions, but above all, <br/>
be with  your kids and really keep tuning in with them. It&#39;s a wonderful life, <br/>
truly -  and that anxiety will die down, I swear! <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have a wired up fired up 4 1/2 yr old.  He still nurses to sleep so its not an issue<br/>
for us, thankfully.  Most nights I am quite relieved by the time he passes out LOL. <br/>
But there was a time when I had lots of littles and not all of them were nursing.<br/>
I can remember sitting on the couch reading and they would fall asleep around<br/>
me as I nursed the youngest.  Or the many nights they would fall asleep on the<br/>
floor next to me while I was on the computer (nursing the youngest).   I would<br/>
then carry each and everyone to there beds.  In those early days, they would<br/>
all still wind up in bed with me, at one time we were five to a bed!  Pretty stretched<br/>
but they all still needed me so.  The older two shared a bed for a few years too.<br/>
I should using this method they often didn&#39;t fall asleep before10pm, often as late<br/>
as midnight.  I used to stay up even later just to have some time alone. <br/>
<br/>
Dylan eats all day long.  We(older  sibs,dad,me) fix him food constantly and he<br/>
has foods he is able to get for himself, yogurt, fruit etc.  When I make meals for<br/>
the family, he usually eats with us whatever we are eating,modified to meet his<br/>
needs (ie, chicken noodle soup, minus the chicken &lt;g&gt;).  He usually likes<br/>
to eat with us in addition to his all day long grazing.  I don&#39;t often have to fix<br/>
him something entirely different than what the rest of the family is eating, but<br/>
if he really has a taste for something else I accomodate.  <br/>
<br/>
Clothing isn&#39;t that big of an issue as we live in S. CA.  When its<br/>
cold and he doesn&#39;t want a coat, I just bring it with us.    <br/>
<br/>
Dylan is loud, busy, bold, loving and sweet.  I often think of him in my mind<br/>
as a whirling dervish, ready to spin off into the sunset.  But...I have proof,<br/>
real physical proof, that meeting the needs of my wild,  impulsive young ones<br/>
turns out well.  My older kids are mellow, easy going, well liked by young<br/>
and old, considerate and fair.  It works.  It just takes time ; )<br/>

I think attachment parenting is &quot;easy&quot; when the child is a baby <br/>

self-sufficient, <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
this is my girls as well- I have a 5 and 3 yr old. The 5 yr old was <br/>
challenging but I could &quot;control&quot; her with punishments and timeouts- <br/>
we did not have a relationship- the little one is now 3 and she is <br/>
the one who led me to AP and Unschooling--(I have a 14 yr old and <br/>
was looking at schooling options)<br/>

<br/>
My 3 yr old is a night owl- and wired until she drops- recently she <br/>
has sat by me to read books but before 3 there was no way she could <br/>
hold still- I removed the bottle at almost 2 and probably saved her <br/>
life and myself a prison sentence by giving it back--- she was not <br/>
able to self soothe or let me do anything to help her. this was pre <br/>
unschooling where I was supposed to be &quot;training&quot; her. <br/>
<br/>
now about 9ish I start making sure they have ate something and see <br/>
if they want a bath- sometimes pj&#39;s- the oldest one sleeps really <br/>
warm and so she sleeps in her undies- the other one wears a shirt <br/>
<br/>
then I ask if they want me to read books- I read until the little <br/>
one is playing more than listening- she listens while she moves but <br/>
is getting closer to the book. Then the older one puts on a movie <br/>
and drinks a bottle- though i am not sure I should admit that my <br/>
almost 5 yr old has a bottle- she tried out her sisters and was <br/>
hooked- it helps her to relax- I figure they both would have been <br/>
extended nursers had I know such a thing exisited. Also sucking from <br/>
a bottle is much the same as sucking from a sippy cup. After more <br/>
than a year they are both having less and less<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I want to know what mealtimes look like, <br/>

 the 14 yr old plays world of warcraft and stays up till wee hours <br/>
of morning and so he sleeps in and eats differently- he rarely eats <br/>
what I make for dinner but we keep things he wants to eat on hand. <br/>
The girls eat what I think they will eat or what they tell me to <br/>
make and I usually make dinner for me and my husband- <br/>
<br/>
we do not eat up to the table as that was torture for us all- I was <br/>
taught that we always eat at the table and my husband could not do <br/>
it so we abandoned the idea and meal times are much nicer now.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

If they think they do not need coats or shoes I ask them to go out <br/>
on the balcony to see if what it feels like- if that does not work I <br/>
say ok I will carry it in case you change your mind- which they <br/>
mostly do by the time we get to the car- if not then oh well-<br/>
<br/>
If we have to be somewhere I explain the night before that we have <br/>
to go somewhere and how it will all work and then in the morning we <br/>
start getting ready- for them it means going out in their pj&#39;s- I do <br/>
not do hair unless they want it and I bring cereal in bags to eat in <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1848407938">I have seven kids, ages 12, 10, 9, 7, 6, 4 and 2. So our routine  <br/>
probably looks a lot different than others...but it seems to me that  <br/>
every unschooler is a lot different that others, so I don&#39;t know how  <br/>
helpful THAT was. Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
We do try to make sure that late evening are calmer in our house,  <br/>
because there are so many of us that it&#39;s just respectful to honor  <br/>
the wishes of the little people. Avari is two, and she will be  <br/>
exhausted and if someone is still movin&#39; and groovin&#39; it&#39;s hard for  <br/>
her to sleep. So I asked the older kids for two hours every evening  <br/>
where we just chill. They were happy to oblige (yeah, because  <br/>
everyone gets private time with the littles asleep!) So we usually  <br/>
have baths or wash our hands and face with lavender water, put on  <br/>
jammies, brush teeth. We have piles of our favorite books on the  <br/>
floor right next to the beds, and we do a traveling story time. We  <br/>
usually start off in the boys room, with everyone crowded around I  <br/>
Spy books, and sometimes How it Works. Then we head downstairs to the  <br/>
girls room to do her little Maisy and Blue&#39;s Clues stories. We  <br/>
snuggle and kiss, and about half of the time lay down with her until  <br/>
she&#39;s asleep. Sam and Dan are very understanding that I snuggle with  <br/>
them a little bit, then head downstairs to snuggle the girls, then  <br/>
bounce around. Avari and Breanna, I travel back and forth, and  <br/>
usually while I&#39;m checking on the other one, kissing and snuggling,  <br/>
the other starts dozing. So I wake them for one last kiss and sweet  <br/>
dreams, and they go to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
Mealtimes, I make one big meal each for breakfast lunch and dinner.  <br/>
They eat what they want, but I usually only make stuff most people  <br/>
like. Anyone who doesn&#39;t like it can reheat leftovers from another  <br/>
night or make ramen or something. We usually do eat together, but the  <br/>
older kids will be running in and out because they are involved in a  <br/>
craft or show. There&#39;s usually at least one person reading at the  <br/>
table. They usually WANT to all be together. But if they don&#39;t want  <br/>
to eat, they can always come in later and get something.  We do  <br/>
always have a snack tray out, after about four pm if they come in  <br/>
I&#39;ll remind them that dinner is in two hours, this is what we&#39;re  <br/>
having, so that they are making educated choices about if they want  <br/>
to fill up or not.<br/>
<br/>
Coats? We have weather check. It&#39;s just something we&#39;ve done since  <br/>
our oldest was little. I always hated my mom saying &#39;get a coat!&#39;  <br/>
when I wasn&#39;t cold. Old people get cold faster, that&#39;s just a  <br/>
fact ;-) Okay, maybe not, but I do know that my kids feel temperature  <br/>
differently than I do. So, we have weather checks. They know who  <br/>
feels like them, so if Emily says it&#39;s good for long sleeve t-shirts  <br/>
and no coat, Rachel can wear shortsleeves and Sam will want a sweat  <br/>
shirt, etc etc. I always offer a coat to the littles, and usually we  <br/>
have spares in the truck. JIC. They just learn. At this point, the  <br/>
littles will holler &quot;I&#39;m doin the weather check!!!!!&quot; so it&#39;s working  <br/>
out well, everyone running around in their various states of undress  <br/>
laughing about being cold.<br/>
<br/>
I like what someone else said. That when you are first starting that  <br/>
you start by letting go of the little stuff. Say yes more often. When  <br/>
that succeeds, you&#39;ll see that it really does work. And then you&#39;ll  <br/>
be happy with letting go of more. Three seems like very young, I  <br/>
know, but Dan was almost three when we started unschooling, and he  <br/>
was the first child I ever had to said to me &quot;Momma, I tired, I get  <br/>
in bed now.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
   I&#39;m guess I&#39;m learning that unschooling is so much more than just <br/>
keeping my<br/>
kids out of school, and yet I don&#39;t really know what that looks like.  <br/>
I would<br/>
SO love to hang out at Sandra&#39;s house, or Joyce&#39;s house, or Ren&#39;s <br/>
house, just to<br/>
get a feel for what the days are like.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Where do you live? Maybe you&#39;re close to someone? Maybe we can hook you <br/>
up? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Also---conferences are HUGE! Find one near you---or just make your way <br/>
to one far, far away. It WILL make a difference!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  I still have this picture of kids<br/>
running amok with no order whatsoever and the parents going nuts, but <br/>
that&#39;s so<br/>
different that what I&#39;m hearing.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And yet that&#39;s *still* the picture people get. Go figure!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
 I&#39;ve also read detailed emails about people&#39;s<br/>
days, and I&#39;m still coming up short!  Is this part of my own <br/>
deschooling process<br/>
to feel so confused and unsure??<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yep. This is new and strange territory for most of us--if not ALL of us!<br/>
<br/>
If you *didn&#39;t* feel confused and unsure, I might be worried. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 My heart says this is so aligned with<br/>
everything I&#39;m really about underneath all my years of conditioning, <br/>
but I don&#39;t<br/>
really know what to do next.  I want someone on my shoulder to tell <br/>
me!!!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re all available to help, but listening to you kids might be a good <br/>
first step. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
   I want to know about how other unschoolers get their 3 year old wired <br/>
up tired<br/>
kids to go to bed,<br/>
<br/>
=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
No more three year olds. &lt;g&gt; But an active day outside helps many. A <br/>
warm drink, dimmed lights, soothing music, snuggling with mom are all <br/>
at the top of the list.<br/>
<br/>
Also changing your goal from &quot;getting wired up tired kids to go to bed&quot; <br/>
to &quot;making the environment peaceful and restful and soothing&quot; might be <br/>
better. Change the focus.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I want to know what mealtimes look like,<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Different on different days. Some meals at the kitchen table. Some in <br/>
the den around the coffee table. Some in our own rooms in bed. Lots of <br/>
snacking. Often on the porch or deck in nice weather. Occasional formal <br/>
dining rooms meals.<br/>
<br/>
Often it depends on the meal being served. Tacos are better at the <br/>
table. &lt;g&gt; Soup and bread are common around the coffee table. Guests <br/>
are almost always served at one of the tables. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ben gets in between 6:00 and 6:15, so I try to have supper ready at <br/>
6:30. Everyone likes supper together at the kitchen table, but we <br/>
sometimes carry it to the den if there&#39;s a board game to play or a <br/>
movie to watch together. But breakfast and lunch are almost always <br/>
looser---with folks up and hungry at different times.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I want to know how<br/>
you get them to put their coats on, etc. when you have somewhere you <br/>
have to be,<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I just pack the car with coats and sweatshirts. They can grab what they <br/>
need. I don&#39;t &quot;have to get them to put their coats on&quot; because I know <br/>
they won&#39;t *choose* to be cold. They&#39;ll dress properly because they <br/>
like to be comfortable. Don&#39;t you? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I just feel so out of my element and like letting it all flow is a <br/>
little scary<br/>
and I feel powerless and out of control in my own house letting the <br/>
girls decide<br/>
so much for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Yeah---but exactly how can you decide *for* them? Do you know how they <br/>
feel? My mother&#39;s *always* cold. 79 degrees is &quot;a little chilly.&quot; &lt;G&gt; <br/>
Both of my boys like it slightly cooler than I do. But if I let them <br/>
run around outside in the snow (which NEVER happens, but it DID snow <br/>
last week in Columbia, SC---while we were in Florida!) with bare feet, <br/>
I know they will be inside shortly for a warm bath and hot chocolate. <br/>
And the next time they go out, they&#39;ll put TWO pairs of socks on under <br/>
their shoes. &lt;G&gt; They&#39;re learning how the world works. My telling them <br/>
how to deal with it will only delay their learning. I *can* suggest and <br/>
offer---and, more importantly, be *prepared* for their <br/>
not-so-well-thought-out decisions so that they aren&#39;t uncomfortable or <br/>
in trouble. But I&#39;m not comfortable deciding *for* them. The neat thing <br/>
is that the have learned to trust my judgment and believe me when I say <br/>
that they will probably be happier with shoes and socks in the snow. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I&#39;m after: their trust in me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2113555541">&lt;&lt;I want to know about how other unschoolers get their 3 year old<br/>
wired up tired kids to go to bed&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am totally new to the concept of unschooling, well- i have always<br/>
heard of it but never really studied it before (is that an oxymoron?),<br/>
but I am not at all new to 3 year olds!<br/>
<br/>
Here are some ideas- when the child is wired up, and you are ready for<br/>
his or her bedtime....<br/>
First, I adjust MY energy to a great inner calm- a very relaxed state,<br/>
almost hushed, soft voice, peaceful smile- sort of a walking<br/>
meditation. I can be playful with the child and still stay within this<br/>
calm state. The wired child in my house needs to be allowed to go with<br/>
her wired state for a bit- I let her jump or do somersaults on the<br/>
bed, dance party, whatever, while at the same time getting pjs,<br/>
talking about bedtime, etc, but with a smile and a feeling of approval<br/>
of her energy state, which is so different than mine. We inadvertently<br/>
started a bedtime tradition in which one of us says, &quot;mommy (or<br/>
anyone), guess what?&quot; mommy (or whomever) replies, of course, &quot;what?&quot;<br/>
and then the first person runs and jumps onto the bed in a fancy or<br/>
funny way. After about 10 or 20 of these, and laughing together, we<br/>
can hug, tickle, and I might start to rub her back. Throughout the<br/>
process, I might be mentioning how tired I am, and how it&#39;s really<br/>
time to snuggle in bed, etc. (softly, and with a dreamy smile and a<br/>
sigh) and on purpose yawning every now and then. Then, eventually, I<br/>
might say, &quot;you pick out a book, or I will pick one out in 10, 9, 8,...&quot;<br/>
This all occurs on our great big california king sized bed. I don&#39;t<br/>
know if this works for you to put your child to bed in YOUR bed, but<br/>
it could just as easily happen in the child&#39;s bedroom- just that our<br/>
little shares a room with a sis 9 years older, so that is her<br/>
territory at bedtime. Some people light a candle, but I am never that<br/>
together. Some TELL a story in a dreamy bedtime voice, but again, I am<br/>
never so together as to memorize a story. We might play a short card<br/>
game in bed or just read stories. We use non foaming, non flouride<br/>
toothpaste (no spitting required), so brushing and flossing teeth<br/>
happens in bed, right before story. I read a story and maybe rub her<br/>
back a bit, and she is out. <br/>
<br/>
The important thing with little children is that they internally<br/>
respond to your inner state. You must come to bedtime with a great<br/>
inner calm and feeling of almost magic, like a wizard or fairy princess. <br/>
<br/>
My husband doesn&#39;t get this. With great energy he loudly repeats over<br/>
and over, Come on- it&#39;s time for bed! let&#39;s get you into bed! get your<br/>
pajamas on! brush your teeth! come on now! etc etc. More stimulating<br/>
than calming. He reads a whole pile of stories, once he can finally<br/>
get her to hold still- trying to &quot;read her to sleep&quot;, and after about<br/>
10 he often falls asleep with her still awake, and after 3 or 4 times<br/>
the length of time it takes me to lull her to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this turned out so long, hope it helps-<br/>

probably looks a lot different than others...but it seems to me that <br/>
every unschooler is a lot different that others, so I don&#39;t know how <br/>
helpful THAT was. Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
We do try to make sure that late evening are calmer in our house, <br/>
because there are so many of us that it&#39;s just respectful to honor <br/>
the wishes of the little people. Avari is two, and she will be <br/>
exhausted and if someone is still movin&#39; and groovin&#39; it&#39;s hard for <br/>
her to sleep. So I asked the older kids for two hours every evening <br/>
where we just chill. They were happy to oblige (yeah, because <br/>
everyone gets private time with the littles asleep!) So we usually <br/>
have baths or wash our hands and face with lavender water, put on <br/>
jammies, brush teeth. We have piles of our favorite books on the <br/>
floor right next to the beds, and we do a traveling story time. We <br/>
usually start off in the boys room, with everyone crowded around I <br/>
Spy books, and sometimes How it Works. Then we head downstairs to the <br/>
girls room to do her little Maisy and Blue&#39;s Clues stories. We <br/>
snuggle and kiss, and about half of the time lay down with her until <br/>
she&#39;s asleep. Sam and Dan are very understanding that I snuggle with <br/>
them a little bit, then head downstairs to snuggle the girls, then <br/>
bounce around. Avari and Breanna, I travel back and forth, and <br/>
usually while I&#39;m checking on the other one, kissing and snuggling, <br/>
the other starts dozing. So I wake them for one last kiss and sweet <br/>
dreams, and they go to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
Mealtimes, I make one big meal each for breakfast lunch and dinner. <br/>
They eat what they want, but I usually only make stuff most people <br/>
like. Anyone who doesn&#39;t like it can reheat leftovers from another <br/>
night or make ramen or something. We usually do eat together, but the <br/>
older kids will be running in and out because they are involved in a <br/>
craft or show. There&#39;s usually at least one person reading at the <br/>
table. They usually WANT to all be together. But if they don&#39;t want <br/>
to eat, they can always come in later and get something. We do <br/>
always have a snack tray out, after about four pm if they come in <br/>
I&#39;ll remind them that dinner is in two hours, this is what we&#39;re <br/>
having, so that they are making educated choices about if they want <br/>
to fill up or not.<br/>
<br/>
Coats? We have weather check. It&#39;s just something we&#39;ve done since <br/>
our oldest was little. I always hated my mom saying &#39;get a coat!&#39; <br/>
when I wasn&#39;t cold. Old people get cold faster, that&#39;s just a <br/>
fact ;-) Okay, maybe not, but I do know that my kids feel temperature <br/>
differently than I do. So, we have weather checks. They know who <br/>
feels like them, so if Emily says it&#39;s good for long sleeve t-shirts <br/>
and no coat, Rachel can wear shortsleeves and Sam will want a sweat <br/>
shirt, etc etc. I always offer a coat to the littles, and usually we <br/>
have spares in the truck. JIC. They just learn. At this point, the <br/>
littles will holler &quot;I&#39;m doin the weather check!!!!!&quot; so it&#39;s working <br/>
out well, everyone running around in their various states of undress <br/>
laughing about being cold.<br/>
<br/>
I like what someone else said. That when you are first starting that <br/>
you start by letting go of the little stuff. Say yes more often. When <br/>
that succeeds, you&#39;ll see that it really does work. And then you&#39;ll <br/>
be happy with letting go of more. Three seems like very young, I <br/>
know, but Dan was almost three when we started unschooling, and he <br/>
was the first child I ever had to said to me &quot;Momma, I tired, I get <br/>
in bed now.&quot;<br/>

&gt; I want to know about how other unschoolers get their 3 year old <br/>
&gt; wired up<br/>
&gt; tired kids to go to bed, I want to know what mealtimes look like, I <br/>
&gt; want to know<br/>
&gt; how you get them to put their coats on, etc. when you have <br/>
&gt; somewhere you<br/>
&gt; have to be, I just feel so out of my element and like letting it <br/>
&gt; all flow is a<br/>
&gt; little scary and I feel powerless and out of control in my own <br/>
&gt; house letting<br/>
&gt; the girls decide so much for themselves.<br/>

different, and it&#39;s easier because kids always have someone to play  <br/>
