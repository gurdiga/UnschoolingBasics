<div id="ygrps-yiv-1435890027">i am new to this list....glad i found it. my children are 7, 5.5, and <br/>
1. my dh and i knew we were going to homeschool from the start and i <br/>
sort of fell upon unschooling and it really seemed to hit a right <br/>
cord with me. my dh was not quite as sure, but not totally against it <br/>
either. when dd1 was 5 we definately unschooled (as well as from the <br/>
very start really, but now we were labled kindergarten &#39;unschoolers&#39;).<br/>
not only do i think we would have chosen to be just learning as we <br/>
lived, but we were forced to since i became pregnant and really sick. <br/>
my dd&#39;s simply had to play play play. friends would come over and <br/>
take them on nature walks (there were ablet o see newt eggs being <br/>
layed and watched the gestation of these babies...what a great <br/>
parallel to what their mom was going through) anyway it was amazing!! <br/>
we live a bit up in the woods, so we decided for no other reason <br/>
than &quot;fun&quot; for the girls we would enroll them in the homeschool <br/>
charter program. it is an enrichment program, big group projects, a <br/>
spring play every year, lots of fun field trips, camping together, <br/>
ect...ect... through enrolling in this program however i was suddenly <br/>
thrown into accounting for our schooling. blak! we would have to sit <br/>
and make semester &quot;plans&quot; witht he charter teacher, do follow up at <br/>
the end to see if those plans were fulfilled...eventually the teacher <br/>
started going over standards with me and &quot;how are they going to be <br/>
met?&quot; sort of conversations. i would share my plans of learning <br/>
through living, following their interests, my confidence in their <br/>
capabitilies.  slowly but surely i was pursuaded to just pick up some <br/>
early readers....how about the bob books....maybe use the math book <br/>
supplied by the school as a guideline....blah blah blah!! i fell into <br/>
the trap!BLAK!! last semester we followed the girls interests, i was <br/>
able to document everything so all were happy for the most part. then <br/>
holiday break came and i started feeling the pressure again to have <br/>
the girls up to &quot;standard&quot;....so....i bought math curriculm, explode <br/>
the code, borrowed story of the world (who am i??) and made a plan to <br/>
do some of these things everyday! wrote up a schedule the whole 9 <br/>
yards! holiday was over....time to start school!! the first week went <br/>
okay, some power struggles, i felt inadequate, we didn&#39;t really have <br/>
much fun (but i sure was ablet o write down alot!), week 2.5 we went <br/>
on a road trip (all books packed, but i didn&#39;t really get them out we <br/>
were having too much fun exploring the science museum, children&#39;s <br/>
museum, going on walks in the city and hikes in old favorite forests <br/>
we used to visit on a regular basis), week 3 back to the books....we <br/>
all hated it! i was a beast, they loathed each other and our home was <br/>
an unhappy one! it wasn&#39;t until week 4 when i got a phone call from <br/>
the charter teacher (even though remember this whole charter is <br/>
supposed to just be enrichment)recommending my oldest dd be held back <br/>
a grade since she isn&#39;t reading and wouldn&#39;t do well on the <br/>
testing....there was a little more in this phone call, but that was <br/>
the straw that broke this camels back (in a good way) we have since <br/>
(a few weeks now) been back to unschooling....books all put away, <br/>
other than our literature books which are asked for on a daily <br/>
basis....my dh (and i) see&#39;s such a dramatic change in the girls, in <br/>
me and our home as a whole!!! he is &#39;almost&#39; convinced! he just wants <br/>
to read a couple more articles and see it take place a little longer <br/>
(he went to school as a teacher and has always been fairly <br/>
alternative....so i know that this will be something that he will <br/>
eventually receives with open arms as a whole). it is a little scary <br/>
turning and walking a totally different direction from all those who <br/>
surround you, but i know it is the best thing for our family. we are <br/>
going to stick wiht the charter for now as our dd&#39;s have friends <br/>
there and love the spring musical they are a part of. i will write <br/>
down the things we do and be proud of not opening up a book we aren&#39;t <br/>
interested in. i will have to seek wisdom from others here who have <br/>
been unschooling faced with pressures from family and close friends <br/>
(most of my friends are all teachers....and not very alternative <br/>
ones), as well as the charter teacher (who is really a wonderful <br/>
lady). with this list i am thankful i will be able to share struggles <br/>
and not feel like all are pointing fingers saying &quot;see i told you it <br/>
wouldn&#39;t work&quot;. SO i thank you in advance! basically that is my intro <br/>
and sort of history of where we are coming from. glad to be here! <br/>
