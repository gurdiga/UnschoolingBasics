<div id="ygrps-yiv-1521986245">My daughter is thinking about having her upper ear pierced through the cartilage. Has anyone here done that? She is concerned about how much it will hurt and if it is easily infected. When she got her lobes double pierced she had trouble with one of them and it took a while to clear up. She followed all the rules they gave her, but I think she may have messed with it too much. She cleaned it constantly and I think it jus got irritated.<br/>

Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-115379531">My daughters have lots of piercings, including the upper ear. Neither of them have had any trouble with the upper ear, except that it took a long time to heal, like six months. It was difficult to sleep on, and a couple of their friends who had &quot;flimsy&quot; upper ears, (thinner and smaller) got what my girls referred to as &quot;deformed&quot; ears....like they collapsed forward or something. (maybe from the weight of the stud?)  My girls have thick cartelage, and all is well and it looks good, IMO.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1607096018">I got mine pierced, it hurt a little bit longer from the initial  <br/>
piercing, and I didn&#39;t get infected. My big deal was making sure it  <br/>
was dry after showers, if it stayed wet or my wet hair got on it, it  <br/>
would start to feel bad.<br/>
I don&#39;t clean mine too much, just run out of time so it got cleaned  <br/>
twice a day. Sounds like all kinds of fun at your house, tats and  <br/>
piercings...dare I ask about hair? ;-)<br/>

I personally have had my cartilage pierced several times (at least 6 <br/>
over the years) and as far as pain wise it was way less painful than <br/>
the lobes.....actually next to my eyebrow it&#39;s been the least painful <br/>
ones I have ever gotten.  Healing is a different story......the first <br/>
time it took at least six months to heal.  I had to be to faithful <br/>
cleaning it 2-3 times a day.  I will suggest H2Ocean, it&#39;s a spray <br/>
and very easy to do and has cut healing times for me or try <br/>
Camphonique.  I suggest these because when I used what the place gave <br/>
me my piercing took forever to heal.  As far as scaring there is only <br/>
1 &quot;old hole&quot; you can see but that could be because I pierced that <br/>
spot 3-4times lol.  Hope this helps :)<br/>
