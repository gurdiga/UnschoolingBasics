<div id="ygrps-yiv-410878424">Hello All, This is just a short blurb to intro us to the group. My name is sarah and we are an Christian Unschooling Family living in Ontario Canada. We have homeschooled/Unschooled now for 14 years and I feel like I am jsut getting my feet wet with all the cool things that life learning has to offer. I have been on groups before years back, but slowly fell away from reading them and then my children decided to try out school in September. They hated it , and 4/5 are now back home as of 4 weeks ago. GLEE. Our oldest who was unschooled his entire life decided to go to highschool this year and loves it. In fact he holds a 90 some odd percent average and even has been excempted from exams this week, so yes unschooling works lol<br/>
We feel truly blessed to be able to live the dream that we live and I look forward to exploring, talking and getting to know people on this list!<br/>
Have a great day!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-517397688">Hi Sarah,<br/>
<br/>
Nice to meet hear from you and welcome!!! It is so nice to hear a very<br/>
successful story!!! Congratulations! I have a 16yr old who I homeschooled<br/>
from 4-9th grades, and a 5 yr old that I am unschooling.  I had never heard<br/>
of unschooling until just last year and I love it.  My 16yr old is in<br/>
public high school too, her strength is in music and singing which is why<br/>
she loves public school.  My youngest is more like me, a bit of a rebel<br/>
always wanting to do things as independently as possible.  I to was<br/>
homeschooled in the late 70&#39;s/early 80&#39;s by my Mom using the Calvert school<br/>
program.  I really enjoyed it, and know that I would&#39;ve really enjoyed<br/>
unschooling even more.  Anyway I just wanted to say welcome and thanks for<br/>
sharing!<br/>
<br/>
~ Angie<br/>
