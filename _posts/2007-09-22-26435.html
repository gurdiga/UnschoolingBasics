<div id="ygrps-yiv-171182606">Forgetting the baby&#39;s birthday was a thoughtless mistake, but the key word<br/>
there is &quot;mistake&quot;. You didn&#39;t fail to show up on purpose, and you<br/>
apologized for your mistake.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s more, the baby isn&#39;t going to remember the party itself, much less<br/>
whether or not you showed up. It seems that your friend needs to develop a<br/>
thicker skin in dealing with situations like this. <br/>
<br/>
Most moms realize that having a family is a ton of work, and we as moms are<br/>
all constantly juggling a thousand different commitments. Sometimes, a thing<br/>
or two will get lost in the shuffle, but that&#39;s just life.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t really offer any specific advice. You know your friend best, so you<br/>
probably know the best way to approach her about it. The main thing is,<br/>
don&#39;t beat yourself up about it, and don&#39;t feel like you have to apologize<br/>
over and over again for the next 20 years. Either she values your friendship<br/>
enough to get past this, or she doesn&#39;t. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-892930184">I think that good friends should understand when good friends mess up-- why did she not call you and ask where you were? If I invited my good friend to a party and she said she was coming I would have called her and said where are you?<br/>
<br/>
so I think the responsibility is not all yours<br/>
<br/>
so how to say sorry- um sorry I missed it I wish you had called when it was obvious I was late- How can I make it up to you<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1166009713">Sounds like there is a lot of heaviness around expectations your<br/>
friend has of you.<br/>
<br/>
I think you made a mistake.  We all make mistakes.  I wouldn&#39;t sweat<br/>
it.  If your friend has issues with it, help her through them or let<br/>
her cool off.  <br/>
<br/>
warmly,<br/>
