<div id="ygrps-yiv-1763423820">&quot;In Chicago you&#39;ll get evicted if you have a 2 bedroom apartment and <br/>
you give birth to a child of the opposite sex.  It happened to a<br/>
friend of  mine, but I&#39;m not sure what the law is.  That may have been<br/>
the apartment  complex&#39;s policy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, but if their policy is in conflict with the law, you can fight<br/>
it. I&#39;m sure a civil rights group would love to get ahold of that one.<br/>
<br/>
What does this all have to do with unschooling? Well, unschoolers tend<br/>
to have a pretty good bullshit radar (thanks Sandy) and question,<br/>
question, question!!<br/>
<br/>
Once you start questioning certain things, it seems to leach into all<br/>
areas of life.:) Look out!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2113136388">I just sent my last post on the subject because I&#39;m starting to get<br/>
angry and I don&#39;t want to go there.  Thats right, though, questioning<br/>
leads to answers.  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1222870453">There are some really old and stupid laws still on the books.<br/>
<br/>
In MA it is illegal to have sex (even in marriage) on Sunday. I can&#39;t<br/>
find the recent article I read, but these laws can still be enforced.<br/>
However, I think there is something else going on when these laws are<br/>
enforced. They are used as excuses to get rid of someone. How sad for<br/>
the person. Can you imagine how mixed up someone would have to be to<br/>
use a law like that to manipulate someone else?<br/>

Just search for blue laws or dumb laws, you should be able to find  all of <br/>
the stupid laws in your state.  In my state oral sex is  illegal.  And lots of <br/>
other stupid stuff.<br/>
