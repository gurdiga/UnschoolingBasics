<div id="ygrps-yiv-1711174692">I have just finished reading some posts on another unschooling list - <br/>
Christian Unschooling - and there is a totally different tone there.  <br/>
Then there&#39;s Radical Christian Unschooling - a little bit more like <br/>
what you all seem to be talking about here.<br/>
<br/>
Is there unschooling and then....radical unschooling, christian <br/>
unschooling, radical christian unschooling, etc.?  Or is it all a <br/>
matter of everyone bringing their own interpretation to the term?  What <br/>
is the true meaning of unschooling?  Is it up to each individual family <br/>
how or whether or not they implement it beyond interest-led learning <br/>
and into parenting/discipline?   Can you be a &quot;Christian unschooler&quot; <br/>
and really be what you are all describing as unschoolers?   Can there <br/>
be a balance or is it all or nothing?<br/>
<br/>
If another homeschool mom asked me if we unschooled - I could <br/>
confidently say yes IF I could clarify what we do not do...which would <br/>
be alot of what everyone here seems TO do.  But is that unschooling?  <br/>
So many questions.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you again and again!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1136989614">Rebecca, first, I believe the Radical Christian Unschool is by my friend,  <br/>
Susan.  She&#39;s not on this particular list.  She is a great mom and  unschooler.  <br/>
She set up that site for people like her, that people didn&#39;t  have to follow <br/>
certain curriculums and spank to be Christian.<br/>
 <br/>
I asked you this when you first started posting and I&#39;ll ask again.   Does it <br/>
matter what you call yourself?  You may prefer to make up your own  name <br/>
based on what you feel highlights what you do.<br/>
 <br/>
When I attended LaLecheLeague, they used to say &quot;Take what you need and  <br/>
leave the rest here.&quot;  That is what these lists are for.  You have  brought up <br/>
some points, we have given our opinion and encouraged you to take  your thinking <br/>
further.  If you are fine with your thinking, that is  fine!  But if you ask a <br/>
question, you will get a passionate response!<br/>
 <br/>
When I first went to LLL, I thought I would never nurse passed a certain  age <br/>
or do that weird thing they were talking about.....homeschooling!  I  would <br/>
sit quietly during those discussions and think to myself &quot;these people are  <br/>
crazy&quot;.  But when I came up on those very forks in the road, I was SO  grateful <br/>
to have learned about these ideas because they ended up being exactly  what was <br/>
right for my children.<br/>
 <br/>
So what are you?  A great mom who is passionate about her  children?  I think <br/>
so, that comes across.  An unschooler, I think  so.  I&#39;m not sure you are <br/>
interested in challenging other bits of your  parenting right now.....if that&#39;s <br/>
true, that&#39;s OK!!  But you may want to  hang out here and continue to see what <br/>
others that have been down that road are  doing.  Just like my experience with <br/>
LLL, those ideas that didn&#39;t mean much  at the time ended up being really <br/>
useful.  In fact, they changed our  lives.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1268588042">Homeschooler---worries about what will happen in the future in both academic and personal areas, needs to work to appease the God of &quot;what if&quot; so &quot;terrible things&quot; such as the curses oflack of a corporate job or poor multiplication skills or, heaven forbid, cursing won&#39;t occur ever<br/>
<br/>
Unschooler--has a gentler relationship with the God of &quot;what if&quot;...feels that concerns about education and learning are only for those unbaptised in the waters of Holt,,,,but holds on to the Heathen ideas of appeasing the God of &quot;what if&quot; in personal and social areas<br/>
<br/>
Radical Unschooler--feels at one with the God of &quot;what if&quot;, understands that this is simply a myth that has been passed down through the centuries, probably used to be a Homeschooler and then an Unschooler but by living as an Unschooler began to see the God of &quot;what if&quot; (even in personal and social areas) as simply being the man behind the curtain from the Wizard of Oz.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-199660379">Except for those fortunate enough to start from birth, very few people go<br/>
from structured schooling to radical unschooling in a day, a week, or even a<br/>
year. It is a philosophy that can and does permeate all of your life,<br/>
including your parenting,  and that can take time.  Everyone will be at a<br/>
different place in the process and each family&#39;s journey will be different<br/>
in the time frame and the details. The goal of these groups is to come along<br/>
side and encourage people to go further in the process and sometimes that<br/>
can seem challenging. Whether you call yourself an unschooloer or not<br/>
doesn&#39;t have to change the process. For a long time I called myself a<br/>
relaxed eclectic homeschooler.  I still use that term in some groups if it&#39;s<br/>
not the time or place to discuss unschooling.  Every family comes to the<br/>
unschooling process with their own set of family dynamics, their own<br/>
world-view, their own values and beliefs.   These will often be challenged<br/>
in the sense that people will want you to think through why you do things or<br/>
believe things.  For myself, unschooling has deepened by faith and beliefs<br/>
because it has caused me to challenge these things and not accept anything<br/>
&quot;just because&quot;, but to find the core of my values and beliefs.  My values<br/>
and beliefs will influence how unschooling looks in our family, but no more<br/>
than my love of literature has influenced how unschooling looks for us.<br/>
Neither my husband nor I are athletic or into sports, whether watching or<br/>
participating, and that has influenced what unschooling looks like in our<br/>
house. We have friends that are way into sports. If has greatly influenced<br/>
their kids&#39; lives and how unschooling looks in their family. If I had a<br/>
child who decided to explore sports, I would find a way to make it happen,<br/>
but it won&#39;t happen naturally in our family. I live my values and beliefs<br/>
with my kids. It is my desire that they share my values and beliefs, but I<br/>
cannot force them to do so. They have to find their own path and they are<br/>
free to do so.  And yet, it can all be unschooling.  Don&#39;t worry what you<br/>
call yourself, just be willing to ask questions, think about all the<br/>
different answers, find what works for you now and be willing to grow and<br/>
change as you learn more.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-326638773">Well, I&#39;m a Director of Religious Education at a Unitarian Universalist  <br/>
church, and unschooling has influenced that work for me dramatically. No, we  <br/>
don&#39;t &quot;unschool&quot; the program -- I&#39;ve never been able to figure out a way to do  <br/>
that with lots of kids, volunteers, etc.  However, I use lots of principles  of <br/>
unschooling in planning the program.<br/>
 <br/>
The goal is to offer tools for the children&#39;s own spiritual journeys.  We <br/>
treat the kids with respect. We assume that people learn best when they&#39;re  <br/>
playing and having fun. (I also never have trouble getting volunteers, because  the <br/>
adults have as much fun and get as much spiritually as the kids.) <br/>
 <br/>
I would talk to the folks who plan the program. Challenge them to make it  <br/>
less schooly. Offer to help. Remind them that a Quaker meeting for adults is a  <br/>
spiritual experience, not a class. (At least silent  meetings...)   Give it a <br/>
try.<br/>

Rebecca, it honestly seems like you are more &quot;stuck&quot; on the labeling, more  <br/>
so than anything. As William Shakespeare wrote in Romeo and Juliet, &quot;What&#39;s in <br/>
a  name?  That which we call a rose By any other name would smell as  sweet.&quot;<br/>
I honestly don&#39;t think any is going to care WHAT you call yourselves. It  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t even really matter. Why is it such an important issue for you to  <br/>
label? This world is just chock full of labelling and it really gets  tiresome.<br/>
If you are doing what&#39;s right in YOUR gut, in YOUR heart for YOUR family,  <br/>
then THAT&#39;S all that matters. Call yourself whatever, it&#39;s not (and shouldn&#39;t)  <br/>
change what you do.<br/>
My family unschools... we don&#39;t use curriculum, we don&#39;t force anything on  <br/>
our kids. However, we are not necessarily 100% following the complete  <br/>
unschooling philosophy. We&#39;re new, and slowly wading in. We have &quot;bedtimes&quot;, but  they <br/>
are flexible. We do run around doing errands, and, yeah, there might be a  <br/>
protest from someone, but we always make sure we do something fun during the  <br/>
trip too (we are limited since we only have one vehicle and DH works full-time,  <br/>
with no way of me driving him into work). We make sure we respect the kids&#39;  <br/>
feelings too. And we learn by living.<br/>
At this very moment, as I am typing, my son (almost 6) is playing  Spyro on <br/>
PS... he is learning to read on his own because he gets tired of asking  us <br/>
what it says. My daughter (4) is sitting next to me, taking over my desk  <br/>
coloring. She asks me to color certain pages, which she has been watching me do  it <br/>
intently. And what is she &quot;learning&quot; from that? She is now more careful and  <br/>
staying in the lines as opposed to just scribbling. She&#39;s choosing colors from  <br/>
the box of crayons that suit her fancy. And &quot;learning&quot; colors too... that <br/>
there  isn&#39;t JUST blue, but cerulean and turquoise, and that the colors stretch <br/>
beyond  the basics. And my toddler? Randomly wandering the living room amongst <br/>
the mess  of toys, and picking out the Duplos and sticking them together. She <br/>
is also  testing limits of how much she can pester her brother. And between all <br/>
of us,  there is constant chatter. We are enjoying ourselves. And learning is <br/>
 inevitable...  <br/>

DH are available (since for the car to be there, DH must be there) - <br/>
which means one person could, in most cases (not all - signing a <br/>
mortgage in both names takes both people for example), be home with <br/>
whichever kid(s) don&#39;t want to go running errands. DH could stay with <br/>
A and B while you take C to the dentist. You could stay with A and C <br/>
while DH takes B along to the bank. And so on. The times when -both- <br/>
adults are *required* to be together to do an errand are pretty small <br/>
generally speaking.<br/>

Ah, so  that means that any time you have errands to do, both you and <br/>
DH are  available (since for the car to be there, DH must be there) - <br/>

For the most part. But, I am disabled, so I need him sometimes, with  <br/>
shopping and such. It&#39;s a tight situation, but we deal with it. It&#39;s not  like we&#39;re <br/>
out everyday of the week running around. Mostly once a week, when my  son has <br/>
art class. DH is off that day, and we do things with the girls.DH does  the <br/>
grocery shopping, since that&#39;s where he works. Once or twice a month, we  will <br/>
do major grocery shopping, but the kids like that because they get a cookie  <br/>
from the bakery and get to ride in the &quot;cool&quot; car-shaped carts. Thankfully, my  <br/>
crew is easily amused and pretty easy to please.  <br/>
