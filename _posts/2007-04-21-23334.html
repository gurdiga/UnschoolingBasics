<div id="ygrps-yiv-97793351">Well, now that I&#39;ve been outed (damn &#39;post&#39; button, i thought i hit Ren&#39;s email button), I guess <br/>
I can thank you all in person for your responses. LOL! I really do appreciate everyone&#39;s <br/>
responses and insight, and I&#39;m going to sit at home and wait for the ugly emails from people <br/>
in our local unschooling group. But perhaps it will spark discussion instead of dissent. <br/>
<br/>
Sigh. Great weekend to look forward to, now I&#39;m nearly preferring the funeral we have to <br/>
attend in an hour. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks again.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-252184986">Well shoot! I went ahead and removed the post after I saw you<br/>
accidentally posted it here Melissa...apparently I&#39;m just adding to<br/>
the confusion.<br/>
<br/>
I really hope this discussion can lead to useful and productive<br/>
solutions for your local group.  Parents that have a child for whom<br/>
hittiing or harming other children is a problem, might need to be more<br/>
aware of this issue. I know I would REALLY appreciate it if someone<br/>
let me know Jalen was having struggles when I was distracted.<br/>
<br/>
He DOES seem to have a goal of hitting babies at times (no, this<br/>
doesn&#39;t make him a &quot;monster&quot; on ANY level.....just something he hones<br/>
in on very quickly as babies annoy the crap out of him) and I have to<br/>
be very aware in certain groups. He&#39;s doing a lot better now, but at<br/>
4y.o. I would never have been able to turn my back for a second in a<br/>
group with a baby/toddler present.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling doesn&#39;t mean leaving kids to navigate on their own.<br/>
Mindfulness takes a lot of effort and awareness.....even with other<br/>
parents. I hope you can all find a place for positive solutions.<br/>
