<div id="ygrps-yiv-1265927162">Okay, let me preface this by admitting it is an annoyingly vague request for<br/>
information.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Several days ago, on one of the many homeschooling lists to which I am<br/>
subscribed, I read some information about a library that allowed patrons to<br/>
check-out books from remote locations. The library would then ship the books<br/>
for a fee.I think it was $30? Not sure if that was a yearly or monthly fee. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
In any case, does anyone know of such a library? Did I just imagine it? &gt;_&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1722835377">I live in a fairly remote location and we use a thing called <br/>
interlibrary loan. It allows you to borrow books from across the <br/>
state for a period of two weeks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-658974495">I live in a very small town too, and our library is connected with<br/>
others throughout the state, I can get inter library loans sent to my<br/>
local library for free. I can go online to the cw mars website and<br/>
look for the books i want and if they aren&#39;t at my home library i just<br/>
request them and they call me when they arrive and i pick them up. I<br/>
use my library card number online to do it.<br/>
