<div id="ygrps-yiv-2015402092">&quot;I suppose he<br/>
does do that type of thing naturally, on his own, with the way he<br/>
plays video games.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ooooh, just last night, dh and I were perusing the magazines at Barnes<br/>
and Noble. I wish I could remember what mag it was (somewhere in the<br/>
business section!) but there was an article about how useful video<br/>
games are for children that are healing. They mentioned all the<br/>
meditative and calming effects for ill children. If it&#39;s good for<br/>
convalescing, then it&#39;s just plain good imo!!:)<br/>
<br/>
I also saw an article about a long-term study done on a large number<br/>
of children about television viewing. The only thing they proved was<br/>
that tv does NOT cause ADHD (duh) nor does it affect ADD or ADHD kids<br/>
negatively, but there was a correlation with more tv viewing and<br/>
higher test scores. Go figure. <br/>
