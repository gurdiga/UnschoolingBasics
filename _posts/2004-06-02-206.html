<div id="ygrps-yiv-492091788">Wow, reading all the posts about food issues, etc has gotten me <br/>
thinking about how unschooling really isn&#39;t just about &quot;learning <br/>
without schooling&quot; It&#39;s so much bigger! Now I need advice!! Here&#39;s <br/>
my story ...<br/>
<br/>
My husband is okay with us not &quot;doing school&quot; anymore. I have talked <br/>
to him about throwing out the curriculum and providing our family <br/>
(Mom and Dad included) with a rich environment to learn from, and <br/>
we&#39;re both on the same page with that. But to be quite honest, until <br/>
the food discussion started on this list I hadn&#39;t really thought <br/>
about how to incorporate the unschooling philosophy to our whole <br/>
life - thus far the only thing that we&#39;ve changed is I&#39;m not forcing <br/>
the kids to do math workbooks or write sentences, and I&#39;m not <br/>
looking for &quot;teachable moments&quot;. But in all other aspects of our <br/>
daily life not much has changed.<br/>
<br/>
But now that I look at the big picture I realize that all of <br/>
our &quot;problems&quot; with the kids are really control issues. DH and I <br/>
have really been having difficulties as far as conflicting parenting <br/>
styles - he was raised with &quot;the Fear of Dad&quot; if Dad says &quot;do this&quot; <br/>
you do it, if Dad says &quot;eat this&quot; you eat it, no questions, no <br/>
negotiation, all dissenters will be punished. Dad was the boss, <br/>
everything went Dad&#39;s way. So now dh has a serious need to be &quot;in <br/>
charge&quot; Whenever a kid questions his authority he hits the roof! He <br/>
sees all the problems as my fault, I am not running a tight enough <br/>
ship. And naturally with that idea planted in my head I feel totally <br/>
conflicted and overwhelmed. I find myself trying to make my <br/>
kids &quot;toe the line&quot; but I want them to be independent thinksers who <br/>
can make their own decisions. I hate being a mom who uses threats <br/>
and guilt to get people to eat their vegetables or clean their room! <br/>
<br/>
In my house Mom and Dad tried to accomodate everyone&#39;s needs as much <br/>
as possible - if Mom made lamb for dinner, she knew I didn&#39;t like <br/>
it, so I got a PB&J sandwich instead. I honestly don&#39;t remember ever <br/>
having conflicts with my parents about food, tv watching, room <br/>
cleaning. After I had kids I asked my Mom how she did such a good <br/>
job raising her kids, her answer: &quot;I led by example.&quot;  This sounds <br/>
so simple, yet for me it is a very HUGE idea!<br/>
<br/>
I will admit that I have not always been the best example for my <br/>
kids. I have yelled, I have spanked, I have even thrown temper <br/>
tantrums! I don&#39;t make my bed everyday, sometimes I go to bed <br/>
without brushing my teeth, sometimes I watch tv all day and eat too <br/>
much junk food, I have been known to talk with my mouth full of <br/>
food... Dh has done all of these things too. So how can we expect <br/>
our kids to be &quot;perfect&quot;? <br/>
<br/>
So here&#39;s my problem... I understand that changes need to be made. <br/>
That we need to stop being dictators and be role models. We need to  <br/>
come up with more creative solutions to address everyone&#39;s needs <br/>
instead of making everyone conform to what Mom and Dad say <br/>
is &quot;right&quot; and &quot;good&quot;. But how do I get my darling husband with his <br/>
humungous control issues to see this point? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for any advice you might have,<br/>
Sarah</div>

<div>Sometimes with a more &quot;authoritative&quot; person, you can have trouble

write it all down----just like what you wrote to us---and be more 
specific.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Ask him to read it----and maybe even write you back. It&#39;s often easier to 
put your thoughts down on paper without blowing up. PLUS, it can give a cooling

<br/>
**WOW!!  Can I relate to you!  This is VERY similar to what is being <br/>
discussed on another thread, and it is EXACTLY what I am dealing with <br/>
in my personal situation at home.  It is beyond frustrating!  <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, I can offer no real advice at this time being that I&#39;m <br/>
in the same exact situation myself.  All I can say is to be <br/>
persistent.  I have tried the letter writing thing for communication <br/>
that was suggested previously by someone else.  I say it&#39;s worth a <br/>
shot, but don&#39;t get your hopes up too high.  In my experience, <br/>
sometimes it works a little, sometimes it doesn&#39;t work at all and <br/>
other times it may make a difference temporarily and other times it <br/>
may make no difference at all.  In my personal experience it never <br/>
made a huge difference.  Everyone is different, so definately try it. <br/>
It is worth a shot. <br/>
<br/>
It really is much easier to communicate on paper.  The difficulty <br/>
comes in when the other person doesn&#39;t like to write.  If nothing <br/>
else, it has the potential to be a good thought provoker and <br/>
conversation starter.  I just wanted to caution you to not have your <br/>
expectations set real high.  In my experience, it&#39;s easier to go into <br/>
it knowing that it may have little to no effect on the situation than <br/>
it is to have these grand expectations, having it flop and facing <br/>
major disappointment. <br/>
<br/>
One other helpful bit, that you probably have figured out already <br/>
given your situation, is to be aware of timing.  With your husband&#39;s <br/>
personality timing is everything.  Definately be aware of his day and <br/>
current mood before handing him a letter or starting up a serious <br/>
conversation about the topic at hand.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, that&#39;s all of my wonderful wisdom and experience.  I really <br/>
feel for you and am right there with you.  If/when you learn anything <br/>
along the way please do share.  I promise to do the same.<br/>
<br/>
My best to you - Tina</div>

husband grew up the same way... thank god he&#39;s willing to listen to <br/>
me... and I did point out to him... how did you feel when your dad <br/>
did that.  That&#39;s what drove it home.  Just because you grew up that <br/>
way doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s the only way to do things.  Tight ships are <br/>
mighty restrictive places to live.  Think about it.  Who wouldn&#39;t <br/>
want to break free and rebel?  God knows I did... and my husband?  <br/>
Forget it.  He was a nightmare back then.  I knew him.  He was the <br/>
classic rebellious in-trouble teenage boy.  Good grief.  hehe.<br/>

is<br/>
ego-driven, this need to be right all the time.  I don&#39;t relate to it, <br/>
and I<br/>
find myself pointing out to my dh that it just isn&#39;t part of my style or<br/>
one of my needs.  He just doesn&#39;t get it.  To him, this is the whole<br/>
crux of parenting.  He sees everything as being about respecting<br/>
authority and proper chain of command.  I want to teach respect.<br/>
I also want to question authority when it makes no sense.  I am<br/>
most into peaceful ways of resolving issues, not these violent<br/>
outbursts of ego.  Is it a Mars/Venus thing???<br/>

I just realized that your &quot;Family Dynamics Question&quot; thread IS very <br/>
similar to my &quot;Control Issues&quot; thread. Yes, it does sound like we&#39;re <br/>
dealing with the same sort of home situation. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all who have put their 2 cents in on my (and Tina&#39;s) <br/>
questions. As usual your advice helps me to realize that I do know <br/>
what to do to fix my problems, I just need a little moral support to <br/>
trust my instincts. <br/>
<br/>
I will keep you all posted on how things go. I have already talked <br/>
to my sister-in-law about watching the kids for a bit so my husband <br/>
and I can have an uninterrupted conversation about this. Hopefully <br/>
he&#39;s in a good, open-minded mood tonight when he gets home and we <br/>
can have a nice discussion :o)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Again,<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know if this is the case in your home, but it may be, and if your like me, you may not even be aware of it.<br/>
<br/>
This very thing has been happening with us. Jason so gets unschooling, he got it before me, as long as it pertains to school. And he has no problem with food restriction, because he wasn&#39;t raised with any. But the rest, has been a battle between us for years. <br/>
<br/>
We were spankers, and yellers. I&#39;ve moved past spanking and I&#39;m trying to move past yelling. Jason is trying to let go of the spanking but is haveing a harder time with it than I am. He had pretty much gotten past it, until we moved. (A move that was for him to go to school-as per my request for a more finanical stable future-he was not interested in going to this school very much) Last week I started reading Wishcaft and something hit me that I honestly hadn&#39;t noticed before. <br/>
<br/>
Jason isn&#39;t happy. He hasn&#39;t been happy in years. And his need to control the kids is directly related to his unhappiness. And the reason he isn&#39;t happy is me. I&#39;ve been forcing him to live a life that I keep thinking that I want and he, out of his love for me, is doing everything that I ask of him, even when it makes him misrable.<br/>
<br/>
We started talking about this this weekend. And the more I can come to terms with my part in his unhappiness and we figure out what we need to do to help him find his happiness, he is starting to let go of his control. He&#39;s finding his way to let go of his control over the kids, as I let go of mine over him.<br/>
<br/>
This may not have anything to do with you and your husband, but htis has been such a revalation to me, and sometihng that 2 weeks ago I never would have concidered, I wanted to share it with you.<br/>
<br/>
I understand where you are, I&#39;ve been there, and just now starting to climb my way out of it. If you need to talk, I&#39;m here :)<br/>

<br/>
I can totall respect this.  I never was much of a spanker.  I just <br/>
didn&#39;t feel comfortable with it, but I have struggled with the whole <br/>
yelling thing.  For some reason it goes in waves.  I make a <br/>
completely conscious effort to maintain my voice level.  It is a <br/>
constant effort that I have to continue working on.  I have made a <br/>
lot of progress in this area, thankfully.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that I know directly effects my ability to maintain is my <br/>
relationship status with Pat.  We directly effect each other&#39;s <br/>
attitudes.  I&#39;m sure you can relate to this judging by your personal <br/>
post.  I continue forward in spite of this difficulty and believe <br/>
that we are all much better off for it.<br/>
<br/>
I have a question about the book &quot;Wishcraft&quot; that everyone keeps <br/>
talking about.  Could you possibly tell me a little more about it?  <br/>
The title itself keeps me at bay.  I&#39;m not really into the whole New <br/>
Age thing, and I&#39;m wondering if it&#39;s that type of slant.<br/>

Thanks for sharing...<br/>
