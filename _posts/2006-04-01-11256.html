<div id="ygrps-yiv-922421662">My son&#39;s legs look horrible, he wears pants almost all the time so I<br/>
don&#39;t really see his legs.  Tonight, with the warmer weather he had on<br/>
shorts and my dh and I couldn&#39;t believe how terrible his calves<br/>
looked.  DS is not super active but when he plays he plays hard, lands<br/>
on the ground but no different than other children.  I wish that I<br/>
were exaggerating about how awful his legs look but it&#39;s bad.  Some<br/>
bruises are huge and they are in close proximity to other<br/>
bruises...I&#39;m very concerned and wanted to present this to the board,<br/>
wondering if anyone knows what may be the problem.  We are talking<br/>
bruises up and down the shin, sides and backs of calves.<br/>
<br/>
His legs got like this when taking karate but he hasn&#39;t done that<br/>
sport in over a year.  Any advice would be welcome, he says that the<br/>
bruises don&#39;t hurt but I don&#39;t know how they can&#39;t.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1892414890">I often have bruises that I don&#39;t remember getting and that look  <br/>
worse than they are (people are always saying, &quot;My god, what happened  <br/>
to you?&quot; and it&#39;s some bruise I didn&#39;t even know I had!). For me, the  <br/>
underlying problem is that I have low platelets (I have about 70,000;  <br/>
150,000+ is normal). Since platelets are part of the clotting  <br/>
process, low platelets can cause bruising when minor bumps cause  <br/>
bleeding that would stop before producing a bruise in a person with  <br/>
normal platelets, but that continues longer in a person with low  <br/>
platelets. I can bump lightly into a doorframe as I walk by, not feel  <br/>
any pain, and forget about it instantly, and later turn up with a  <br/>
bruise there that looks like I was flung into the steering wheel in a  <br/>
high-speed impact! Other bleeding disorders can also cause uncommonly  <br/>
heavy bruising. Many are not serious--I, for instance, have never had  <br/>
to be treated for mine except when pregnant (women have fewer  <br/>
platelets when pregnant, and when I&#39;m pregnant my platelets drop to a  <br/>
dangerous level and I have to be treated to increase them until the  <br/>
baby is born).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sandy, my brother was like this.  He always had bruises all over.  Half the<br/>
time he couldn&#39;t even tell you how he got them. He was a rough and tumble,<br/>
climbing through the trees (falling out fo the trees), over the river and<br/>
through the ditch culverts from dawn to dusk (Oh what a life he would have<br/>
had if my parents had unschooled him!)  Anyway, today he still gets bruises<br/>
all over.  His doctors used to say that he was anemic, but when they would<br/>
test him his iron counts always came out fine.  Once he had to go in for<br/>
something and the doctor noticed all the bruises.  Asked my mom to step out<br/>
of the room so he could talk to him alone.  My mom thought it was a &quot;guy&quot;<br/>
discussion that he might be too embarassed to talk about with mom in the<br/>
room.  About 5 minutes into the interview my mother his great rolls of<br/>
laughter coming out of the office.  The doctor opened his door with tears<br/>
rolling down his face.  He thought my brother was an abused child as many<br/>
parents who abuse will hit their children&#39;s legs.  When he asked my brother<br/>
about his bruising and where he got them my brother launched into this story<br/>
about how he and Timmy &quot;climbed up in the Chinaberry tree.  But don&#39;t tell<br/>
my mom because we aren&#39;t supposed to climbe the Chinaberry tree.  Anyway, we<br/>
got near the top and all the little Chinaberry branches started to snap off<br/>
and the next thing me and  Timmy knew we were falling through the Chinaberry<br/>
tree and couldn&#39;t stop.  We fell all the way to the bottom.  But PLEASE<br/>
don&#39;t tell my mom.  She told us that would happen and I don&#39;t want her to<br/>
know we found out the hard way.&quot;  This was followed with other escapades of<br/>
my brother, Timmy and George and many trees they had encountered and forts<br/>
they had built and games of war they had played using clay dirt clods as<br/>
ammunition.<br/>
<br/>
If they aren&#39;t hurting him, he is eating well and they heal within a few<br/>
days I wouldn&#39;t worry.  You could also give him oral arnica a few times a<br/>
day and get him some Arnica Flora to rub on any bruises that he does get to<br/>
help aid in healing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-799537185">Just to be safe, I say see a doctor. I mean you&#39;ll<br/>
probably hear, he&#39;s fine, nothing to worry about. But<br/>
that&#39;s a good thing. My brother had a rare blood<br/>
(diease, not sure if that is the right word). But up<br/>
until my son is 7, I have to keep an eye out for<br/>
excesive brusing. I guess by 7 they usually out grow<br/>
this disorder. (?) <br/>

Oh yes, and we&#39;ll be seeing her next week.  She isn&#39;t open on the<br/>
weekends though and I was just hoping that someone could ease my fears<br/>
in the meantime and they already have.  :-)  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sue, thank you sooo much.  This is my son exactly, because on a lot of<br/>
day he is sedentary.  When he does play it&#39;s hard but whereas dd can<br/>
climb a tree and have nothing but a scratch, apparently it&#39;s not the<br/>
same as ds.  When she climbs a pile of rocks, nothing, just a little<br/>
gray dirt but last night upon closer examination, Zak has rock size<br/>
bruising on his thighs.  Also, he and the boys play with air soft guns<br/>
(wearing safety glasses) and some are the size of the plastic bb&#39;s. <br/>
He has a ball playing them and doesn&#39;t want to stop.  However, the<br/>
one&#39;s on his shins and side calves, not pretty.<br/>
<br/>
I was scared because immediately my mind is freaking out that<br/>
something is horribly wrong. Although I&#39;m sorry that you bruise easy,<br/>
you have really helped dramatically help ease my fears....thank you. <br/>
Also, thank you for going into such detail about your blood platelets,<br/>
good to know these things before going to the doctor because now I can<br/>
ask.<br/>
<br/>
If he would wear shorts I would notice, but after seeing his legs, I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t want to wear shorts either.  :-(  When they get older, you<br/>
don&#39;t see nakedness so unless they tell you, you don&#39;t know.<br/>
