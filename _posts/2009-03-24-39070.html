<div id="ygrps-yiv-486764581">Hi!  My name is Kelly.  I&#39;m new to this list.<br/>
I have five kids, four unschooling, (really<br/>
more still deschooling at this point), and <br/>
one in school by his choice.  <br/>
<br/>
I have a question about helping one of my sons <br/>
deal with some frustration he is having.<br/>
<br/>
He was born with a cleft lip and palate.<br/>
He lived in an orphanage until just<br/>
this past July, when he joined our family.<br/>
He never had any speech therapy before<br/>
joining our family.  He is eight, will be<br/>
nine in a few days.<br/>
<br/>
Since coming home to us, we have had<br/>
him going to speech therapy three or<br/>
four days a week.  Right now, the only<br/>
sounds he can make are L, M, N, and<br/>
vowel sounds, plus glottal stops.<br/>
(If you don&#39;t know what a glottal stop is,<br/>
say &quot;uh-oh!&quot;  Feel how you stop the air<br/>
in your throat between the &quot;uh&quot; and the &quot;oh&quot;?<br/>
That&#39;s a glottal stop.)<br/>
<br/>
Well, the issue is, our son does not like<br/>
speech therapy.  He gets very frustrated,<br/>
and he doesn&#39;t want to go and work at something<br/>
so frustrating.  I can understand that. <br/>
<br/>
If somebody told me that I MUST learn to do all the <br/>
things with my toes that I am currently able to do with <br/>
my fingers, I would be really frustrated.  I KNOW<br/>
there are people out there who are able to do it.<br/>
I suppose I could learn how to coordinate all those<br/>
little muscles, too.  But it would be really frustrating.<br/>
<br/>
The difference is, if I don&#39;t learn to use my feet like<br/>
hands, nothing in my life changes (as far as I know!)<br/>
If my son doesn&#39;t go to speech therapy, he avoids<br/>
the frustration of doing exercises that are hard, but<br/>
he INCREASES the frustration of most people not being<br/>
able to understand a word he says.<br/>
<br/>
His speech language pathologist keeps asking me<br/>
what motivates my son.  She is looking for an<br/>
incentive program to keep him on track.<br/>
<br/>
I have told her, time and again, that our family<br/>
does not believe in forcing children to do specific<br/>
tasks, and that we really do not dig token economies,<br/>
but the SLP keeps asking.<br/>
<br/>
I know my job is not to please her, but to advocate<br/>
for and support my son.  But it is complicated, because<br/>
as much as he dislikes speech therapy, he equally dislikes<br/>
not being able to make himself understood.  (His sibs<br/>
and I understand him, but most people he interacts with<br/>
simply have NO IDEA what he is saying, and it really<br/>
does frustrate him.<br/>
<br/>
One choice I have is to drop the speech therapy, and let<br/>
him tell me if and when he is ready to give it another try.<br/>
Let him decide which frustrations he is going to face.<br/>
That option opens me up to investigation:  where I live,<br/>
the law requires homeschooling families to provide<br/>
&quot;special educational services&quot; (speech therapy would count)<br/>
to children who need such services.  I could be accused<br/>
of educational neglect for not forcing speech therapy on him.<br/>
<br/>
But setting aside fear of the law, I do feel confident that a time<br/>
will come when his desire to be understood by others will<br/>
outweigh his reluctance to face the hard work the therapy<br/>
entails.  Perhaps in a few more years, when hormones hit,<br/>
and he becomes interested in romance?<br/>
<br/>
What I am currently doing is let him know that I understand<br/>
he is frustrated, but I think he should continue on.  I remind him <br/>
that *he* really wants his friends to understand what<br/>
he is saying and that the work he is doing in speech therapy<br/>
is what is going to allow him to learn how to speak clearly.<br/>
<br/>
I accept that in any 30 minute session, my son<br/>
may goof around for 25 minutes and do &quot;only&quot;<br/>
five minutes of &quot;productive&quot; work.  I accept the<br/>
fact that this is frustrating for the SLP.  But<br/>
the SLP&#39;s frustration is not my concern.  My son&#39;s<br/>
frustration is.<br/>
<br/>
But, to reiterate, he is going to be frustrated by his<br/>
speech impediment (I wish there were a better word<br/>
or phrase than that) whether he works on overcoming<br/>
it or whether he chooses not to work on overcoming it.<br/>
<br/>
He tells me he doesn&#39;t want to go.  Do I honor that?<br/>
If I do, the natural consequence is that people will<br/>
continue to not understand him, and he will continue<br/>
to be frustrated by that, and shut out of friendships<br/>
because of it.  I see him trying to strike up conversations<br/>
with the other boys on his gymnastics team and in his<br/>
Tae Kwon Do class.  I see him fighting back tears when<br/>
they simply turn away from him b/c they don&#39;t know<br/>
what he is saying.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing those interactions leads me to believe that<br/>
continuing to encourage him to go to speech therapy<br/>
is the right thing to do.  But where does encouraging<br/>
end and forcing begin?<br/>
<br/>
I do not like failing to  honor his right to say, <br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t want to do this.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, I have already done that to him.<br/>
He needed ear tubes to drain fluid from<br/>
his middle ears and he needed his soft<br/>
palate lengthened, and although he told me,<br/>
&quot;I already had two surgeries in China; I don&#39;t<br/>
want to have more surgery!&quot; I went ahead and<br/>
let the surgeons put those tubes in and lengthen<br/>
that palate, b/c I understood there were medical<br/>
issues that my son could not understand.<br/>
Still, it didn&#39;t feel good, forcing surgery on him.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, to sum up:  if you were in our shoes,<br/>
what would you do?<br/>
<br/>
Your advice, suggestions, wisdom is much appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-95253786">Hi Kelly,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to this group too and just stumbled across another article on another group, that might help you.<br/>
<br/>
It was about tagteach and the link I got was<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.tagteach.com/">http://www.tagteach.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
reading along I found it a good way to learn/teach things without the often underlying &quot;that was better,but...&quot; which people hoped to help me with but often put me of.<br/>
Basicly one very specific outcome is rewarded when it happens and ignored when not. Sometimes you can keep track of the hits through beads, blocks, stickers or the like that are traded in for a chosen reward later.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I know, you don&#39;t like incentives but maybe for him a very visible association like &quot;with every block I collect, my friends will understand me better&quot; could help him keep going - just a thought.<br/>
<br/>
For an incentive, what about a picture representing a sound or word he said correctly, which he can color in and put on the fridge or somewhere in his room to look at and be happy about his achievments?<br/>
I&#39;d probabely start with the words or sounds he&#39;s already pretty good at, to help him feel positive about what he can do already (instead of focussing on what he can&#39;t do). If he can share that with the people he loves most - even better.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck and all the best to you<br/>

 _________________<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a speech pathologist and try to chime in with some unschooling perspective occasionally about speech therapy.? I do understand both sides of your situation.? Since your son has the physical issues that come with cleft palate, speech therapy should be the best avenue to help him get to the point where his speech is more understandable.<br/>
<br/>
My first suggestions would be to help him to develop ownership of his speech.? What can be done so that he is the one making the decisions about his communication abilities??? Things to consider...<br/>
<br/>
Does he like the speech therapist?? If not, consider getting another one who will work with him.? Maybe 30 minutes is too long for him and 15 minutes to demonstrate how to work on one thing and then ideas for practicing at home might help.? Maybe twice a week would be enough.<br/>
<br/>
Would the therapist be willing to work with you during that 30 minutes and then you help him (maybe in a game format) with some of the sounds he is working on?? Would she give him some options for fun therapy activities that he would enjoy?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe take a break from speech therapy and see if the speech pathologist would give your son some things to work on at home?? The whole idea here is to have your son be the one that chooses how he wants to pursue this.? In this way, it becomes a partnership with the three of you rather than someone making him do something that is just really difficult and often frustrating.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;d like to write to me off list, I&#39;d be happy to give you some resources where you could also buy some games that he might enjoy as he develops more sounds as well as brainstorm with you about more ideas.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-774529742">Hi Kelly,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to the group and just preparing to embark on an unschooling journey with my kids.<br/>
<br/>
I feel for you and your frustration and know what it&#39;s like to try and wrestle (not physically, but you know) a kid into doing something they don&#39;t want to do. I was &quot;that kid.&quot; My husband was that kid. And now, not surprisingly, we have one of our own. Which is what is leading us to consider unschooling for next year.<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, we are having our struggles getting my son through this last bit of the school year, and a child psychologist friend pointed me in the direction of a website that is helping. And especially since you say your son has his own frustration with his speech, I could imagine this approach will work very nicely.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.thinkkids.org/">http://www.thinkkids.org/</a><br/>
<br/>
I think it will jibe with your resistance to reward and punishment. The basic premise is that you work with your child to really understand what his resistance is to going to speech therapy and you explain why you are concerned about his resistance/what will happen if he stops going, and then ask him to help you come up with a solution.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m copying in a link to their blog about how this conversation might work. The scenario they are using is a kid with health problems who doesn&#39;t want to take a lunch from home when he goes out with friends. It was the closest thing I found on the site that seemed to sort of mirror what you are going through.<br/>
<br/>
Go to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.thinkkids.org/blog/?id=1">http://www.thinkkids.org/blog/?id=1</a> and look for &quot;No Compromise?&quot;  7/30/2008<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t speak to the legal ramifications of letting him stop, but I would think/hope that if you took a break with the intention of starting again next year or whenever, that you would be &quot;safe.&quot; Is there a homeschooling advocate in your area you can consult? You may want to know how much leeway you have before you agree on a solution with your son. If he wants to just quit, but that will land you in trouble and him in school, that is something you need to know. But if he could take a break for the remainder of the school year with no legal ramifications, you might want to know that, too.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck,<br/>

If you can get involved in a local deaf community, too, it would give him access to folks who have a better understanding of verbal communication difficulties in the world at large and allow him to gain a wider variety of strategies for overcoming them. <br/>
<br/>
Its also something you can learn with him - which breaks down the onus of him fighting to learn something the people around him do effortlessly. That might help him develop some confidence, too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1364759121">Although I don&#39;t expect a lot of you to understand this, please<br/>
remember this child is an older (meaning not a baby) adoptee from a<br/>
foreign country where he lived in an orphanage.  The pychological<br/>
changes this makes to a child are profound.  My own daugther spent 3<br/>
yrs tied on her back in a crib.  I had to &quot;teach&quot; her how to cry, that<br/>
her needs would be met, that she even HAD needs...forget about wants.<br/>
Now home some 15 months, she knows what she wants when we deal with<br/>
basic ideas like snack foods, and toys.  But she has NO opinion on<br/>
clothes, dinner foods, whether or not she eats breakfast etc....<br/>
<br/>
So asking Kelly to ask her son to be a partner in this journey isn&#39;t<br/>
necessarily going to work.  Additionally, children from orphanages<br/>
tend to be severely emotionally, if not developmentally retarded<br/>
(retarded used in it&#39;s perfectly acceptable English definition here<br/>
not the common usage) so her son can look 8 or 10 or 22 but be 2 or 5<br/>
or 15 etc...depending on the skill you are looking at.  My daughter is<br/>
4.5 but is really more like a 2 yr old in many ways.  And she doesn&#39;t<br/>
speak.  So in speech, expressive speech, she&#39;s even further behind.<br/>
<br/>
And the final &quot;gift&quot; of the orphanage experience is the inability to<br/>
grasp what it means to be &quot;family&quot; , that one won&#39;t be &quot;sent back&quot; for<br/>
doing &quot;bad things&quot;, abuse, neglect, teasing, malnutrition, resource<br/>
guarding and fighting, and a general mistrust of strangers.  So if<br/>
anyone can help Kelly keeping these very primal triggers in mind that<br/>
would be good.  I&#39;m reading this too because Morgan has been<br/>
&quot;prescribed&quot; a Nothing In Life Is Free program to make her speak (in<br/>
other words, she wants a snack and I dangle it over her head until she<br/>
says &quot;snack&quot; or whatever...and I&#39;m not going to do that to her.)  But<br/>
she should learn to speak because she&#39;s becoming frustrated with not<br/>
being able to get her point across to anyone but the family.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1561528044">Kelly,<br/>
I tried to respond to your post yesterday but something was wrong with Yahoo.  Here I go again. <br/>
I am a speech path but I am also a mother of 4 kids (two who were adopted at the ages of 2 and 5) and also have kids with speech issue (not as severe as yours however).<br/>
<br/>
Personnally, I dont believe speech therapy as you describe it is doing anything but aggrevate your son and will not help in the long run, but might actually hurt things, because his attitude toward it will be bitter but his speech will not improve unless he wants it to and is willing to work toward it.  It is like trying to teach a child to read, who has not interest in reading and perhaps isnt even ready to read.<br/>
<br/>
If your son is able to talk to you about what might make the therapy more bearable, I would start by discussing that with him.  Perhaps he would do the exercises with you but not the therapist. (the therapist can show you what to look for and how to do them)  Perhaps having siblings involved, things like that.  I dont know your therapist but I ask parents about what motivates their kids not to set up a token system but to have more activities centered around their interests so that they are more likely to want to participate.  Approaching that with her might help.  <br/>
<br/>
When it comes down to it though, thinking about your sons communication not as speech but as a whole system is important.  Expanding all is his modes of communication, be is spoken language, signs, pictures, written words, hand gestures etc..  even if he continues in therapy right now, it will be years before he is through and in the meantime he needs to be able to communicate.

One more thing.<br/>
Could you describe what speech therapy looks like for your son?  What is the therapist trying to do with him?  Is is in your home?  Is she trying to drill him on words or sounds or is she working on non speech exercises or is she playing games etc....</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-568195539">Hey everybody~<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the food for thought.  <br/>
<br/>
And HI KAREN!<br/>
Thanks for explaining the unique challenges that<br/>
go along with RU parenting children who have<br/>
come from situations that have taught them not<br/>
to trust, not to attach... it&#39;s really a huge difference<br/>
from having a baby and taking an AP approach with<br/>
that child from birth.<br/>
<br/>
This particular son is extremely extroverted and wants<br/>
to make friends, and his speech impediment is holding<br/>
him back.  So, if we drop speech therapy, he is going<br/>
to continue to experience the frustration of potential<br/>
friends quite literally turning their backs on him.  He <br/>
is delightfully funny and personable, so this is really sad.<br/>
<br/>
The therapy is focused on the sounds he can make.  <br/>
The SLP is guiding DS to notice whether air is coming<br/>
out of his nose or out of his mouth.  They are also<br/>
working on learning to close the palate.  That is a big<br/>
challenge, but the first step to making most consonant<br/>
sounds. <br/>
<br/>
The &quot;work&quot; is all very playful:  they paint their palates<br/>
with blue popsicles--the SLP does the activities alongside<br/>
DS--and then look in the mirror with a flashlight to see<br/>
their palates opening and closing.  They make sounds<br/>
into a mic connected to a computer so that DS can see<br/>
on the screen when he is (and when he isn&#39;t) making <br/>
glottal stops.  They talk with a tube over the nose<br/>
and the other end held to the ear, again to distinguish<br/>
oral from nasal sounds.  It is all very playful and low<br/>
key, but DS is a smart kid; he knows it is work.  And<br/>
I&#39;m sure he&#39;s afraid to fail.<br/>
<br/>
Like Karen said, our kids have had rough starts to life.<br/>
This particular son told me that adults hit him in China.<br/>
He demonstrated placing a closed fist to his cheek.  Yes,<br/>
he was punched in the face by caretakers.  Another son,<br/>
from a different orphanage, a different province, was talking<br/>
to me last night about death.  (My MIL is terminally ill.)<br/>
He told me that sick kids are left alone to die, and then <br/>
left until whenever &quot;a big truck&quot; comes to collect the corpses.<br/>
He talked about how &quot;worms eat dead babies&#39; eyes.&quot;<br/>
Sorry to be so graphic, but it is important to understand<br/>
that for these kids to show any weakness, to admit<br/>
any vulnerability...<br/>
<br/>
...that feels like a death threat.  Because where they came<br/>
from, weakness and vulnerability actually could lead to<br/>
death.  It was a very brutal, survival of the fittest beginning<br/>
to life.<br/>
<br/>
You know, I&#39;ve tried to explain this to the SLP, but<br/>
maybe I need to have the talk again, and be just<br/>
as explicit as I have been here, so that she understands<br/>
his resistance to the therapy.  I&#39;m not sure there is anything<br/>
I can say to get her to understand my resistance to the <br/>
token economy.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate the thoughts about ASL, but the goal really<br/>
is to be understood by other people in general.  ASL isn&#39;t<br/>
going to help with that, unfortunately.<br/>
<br/>
Ah, it&#39;s complicated!<br/>
I appreciate all the thoughtful responses.  I really do.<br/>
Now I have to decide what to do!<br/>
<br/>
Kelly<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  The therapy is in her office; I couldn&#39;t get my<br/>
insurance to approve home visits.<br/>

Is there any way for the therapy sessions to be shorter? Or if there is any way that you can incorporate any of the &#39;exercises&#39; into your normal day to day stuff to allow him to experience &#39;success&#39; towards his goal of being understood by his &#39;friends&#39; without the &#39;pain&#39; of the long therapy sessions.<br/>
<br/>
AND I would urge you to learn EFT (Emotional Freedom Techniques) and assist this whole issue from your side with this wonderful technique. There seems to be so much trauma in his life already which can of course hinder his progress in many ways.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are more ways to communicate other than Spoken English. If a<br/>
child grows up hemmed in with the thought the only way to communicate<br/>
with other people is by speaking, that creates a miserable environment<br/>
because their abilities will never be as &quot;normal&quot; as &quot;people&quot; think.<br/>
I grew up with speech therapy and to be honest, speech therapy served<br/>
to remind me how I will NEVER have a perfect voice.<br/>
<br/>
I get along just fine with the community at large by writing and<br/>
gesturing with the &quot;signing-impaired.&quot; I&#39;ve noticed that people from<br/>
some foreign countries are often comfortable using their body language<br/>
to communicate -- perhaps because they have more lingual diversity at<br/>
home and can adapt easily.   It is far more important to have the<br/>
capacity of creating opportunities than to bulldoze through a single<br/>
option.<br/>
<br/>
ASL is also used in full-hearing classroom to give children a<br/>
kinesthetic feel of language -- it increases literacy.  The research<br/>
is on the web.  It does not jibe with unschooling principles to<br/>
dismiss an option without considering it thoroughly, especially when<br/>
it comes to something as sensitive as a structural difference in the<br/>
body.<br/>

For instance, DS may want to play violin with his sibs, and if<br/>
he wants to let them know what string the song starts on,<br/>
he can only say E and A.  And then we don&#39;t know whether<br/>
he means E, D, or G.  Of course, he can simply point to the<br/>
string he means, but he can also use the sign.  <br/>
<br/>
We all have fun playing around with ASL.  It came into my<br/>
home b/c my dad was a paramedic who wanted to be able<br/>
to communicate with deaf patients.  I picked up a little, and<br/>
for awhile, DH and I would use signs while eating.  Didn&#39;t want<br/>
to talk with our mouths full, but were young and in love and<br/>
had so much to share.  And then our kids picked up an interest<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Adrean, you are right, of course.  Re-reading my response,<br/>
I did sound dismissive.  I am sorry.  It would have been <br/>
better to say that we are playing with ASL and will follow<br/>
DS&#39;s lead in exploring it further, but that I remain concerned.<br/>
The kids who won&#39;t take the time to figure out his utterances<br/>
probably aren&#39;t going to take the time to learn ASL either.<br/>
<br/>
But as a later poster mentioned, there will always be people<br/>
who don&#39;t understand and that is a reality that DS is going<br/>
to have to come to terms with.<br/>
<br/>
I remain optimistic that in time, his spoken language will<br/>
be much more understandable to most people.  He is<br/>
very funny and outgoing and a lot of people are missing<br/>
out on his insights because they aren&#39;t taking the time<br/>
to understand him.<br/>

be the only thing is giving it time, letting your son have time to<br/>
