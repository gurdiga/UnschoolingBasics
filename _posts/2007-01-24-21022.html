<div id="ygrps-yiv-732172060">Hello,<br/>
We are a new family to unschooling. We have two dds, 5 and 2. I had <br/>
my 5yro dd in preschool a bit and saw it squash her creativity and <br/>
cause behavior issues. I had to convince my dh..who is not an easy <br/>
person to convince and often times tells me to put her in school,but <br/>
actually it is working ok. (My parents still cannot understand <br/>
why,as they put it,&quot;I would want to do that to MYSELF&quot; and have no <br/>
free time, etc.) <br/>
The problem is that I do have days..maybe 3 a week, where I feel <br/>
like throwing my 5 yro the next school bus that comes down our <br/>
street! She was literally an angel until the 2yr old was born. <br/>
Since, she is controlling, bossy, tells many &quot;stories&quot;, and many <br/>
times just mean to her sister or us. I have tried many approaches <br/>
but my patience wears thin and often I resort to yelling(which I <br/>
hate) but it seems to be the only thing that gets her attention. I <br/>
know she is tired and really still could benefit from a daytime nap<br/>
(I know this from the rare days she looks at bookS and falls asleep <br/>
for 2 hrs and afterward is so much nicer all day!)But she refused my <br/>
suggestions of a nap or even quiet time most days.<br/>
<br/>
If/when, I make suggestions to her, she often uses that <br/>
whinny,snotty voice and says or screams her answers. I am really <br/>
just confussed about unschooling as a parenting style..but now as an <br/>
education style..which I get and really like. It seems people just <br/>
change words around like principles for rules. I mean..how does one <br/>
handle it when your child smacks, or kicks a sibling, or rips a toy <br/>
from her hand,talks in that snotty tone of voice, etc etc. You can <br/>
say it is disrespectful to her..,etc etc..but she could care less. <br/>
Also, how can someone say that a LIMIT and a contract regarding <br/>
it..such as staying up late as long as they are not loud and waking <br/>
others is any different to another person who says you can play with <br/>
any toys you want, as long as when you are done, you clean up or put <br/>
it away?? To me it is the same . We have a smaller home all on one <br/>
level and so it is important for us to be able to live/move around <br/>
in the home when the toys are picked up and not scattered all over <br/>
all day!<br/>
Any insight..sorry I babbled a bit. I&#39;m not sure I made any sense!<br/>
Thanks pam</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-134640833">Hi, Pam, I&#39;m Meredith, mom to Mo (5) who has &quot;always&quot; been <br/>
unschooled, and stepmom to Ray (13) who&#39;s new to our home and <br/>
unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If/when, I make suggestions to her, she often uses that <br/>
&gt; whinny,snotty voice and says or screams her answers. I am really <br/>
&gt; just confussed about unschooling as a parenting style<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What kinds of suggestions are you making? I usually start by asking <br/>
my 5yr old questions if I think she needs my input for some reason. <br/>
When she whines or screams at me I take it as a sign that I haven&#39;t <br/>
been listening or responding to her needs very promptly - with a <br/>
toddler underfoot you may have been saying a lot of &quot;hold on...in a <br/>
minute...not right now...later...I&#39;m in the middle of something...&quot; <br/>
all that can add up to a huge bill of frustration for a kid. <br/>
<br/>
A whole lot of unschooling younger kids has to do with being <br/>
proactive in making sure they have the tools they need to be <br/>
autonomous and looking carefully for nonverbal cues. Some kids are <br/>
great at being able to tell you what they want/need and listen to <br/>
explanations, but alot aren&#39;t. Mine&#39;s not. She&#39;s waaaaaay better <br/>
than she used to be, but she&#39;s still not the most conversational of <br/>
children, so looking for non-verbal cues and patterns is a big part <br/>
of how I help her get her needs met. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It seems people just <br/>
&gt; change words around like principles for rules. I mean..how does <br/>
 </span></blockquote>one <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; handle it when your child smacks, or kicks a sibling, or rips a <br/>
 </span></blockquote>toy <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; from her hand<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, these are all Great places to look for ways to be proactive. <br/>
Why would a child hit (etc) another? Well, she might be hungry, or <br/>
tired or feeling out of control or frustrated or.... She doesn&#39;t <br/>
have the means to asses her own internal state and communicate it in <br/>
a clear way, yet, so part of mom&#39;s job is to be aware of those <br/>
possibilities and seek to address them *before* it gets to the <br/>
hitting stage. That&#39;s not about rules at all, its about how to be a <br/>
better mom.<br/>
<br/>
Some of that involves being aware of patterns - how long has it been <br/>
since she had some protein? how many times has she needed a grown-up <br/>
to help her, today? how often has she felt &quot;second best&quot; to the <br/>
toddler? Some of it involves mom being available in the moment - I <br/>
mean right there on the floor with the kids, not trying to get the <br/>
dishes washed and laundry folded while the kids play. If you are <br/>
right there in the middle of things, you have the chance to see the <br/>
frown and ask &quot;can I help&quot; or catch the hand before it hits. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;talks in that snotty tone of voice<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;ve mentioned this a couple times, so clearly its an issue for <br/>
you. I&#39;d suggest you look at a couple different things, here. First <br/>
of all, what tone of voice do *you* use and what kind of language do <br/>
you use with your dd? Sometimes that snotty tone is what We sound <br/>
like to Them. Oops. Make a concious effort to listen to yourself, <br/>
especially when you are saying something like &quot;Not now&quot;. Also watch <br/>
out for times when you may be &quot;lecturing&quot; her - I don&#39;t know anyone, <br/>
kid or grown who likes to be lectured, but so far I&#39;ve never met a <br/>
parent who doesn&#39;t at least do it occasionally (accidentally - I do <br/>
it myself). Its also a possible source of &quot;snotty tone&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;cleaning up....<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My gosh, there are whole threads on this topic alone! Really, I&#39;d <br/>
recommend reading the archives both here and at Always Unschooled:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysUnschooled/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysUnschooled/</a><br/>
<br/>
which is a board with a focus on unschooling with little kids, even <br/>
pre-school and babies.<br/>
<br/>
I guess a short answer is to look for alternatives - ways to <br/>
simplify cleanup for you or make it less of an issue overall.<br/>
<br/>
 The one idea I would pull from your post for you to consider <br/>
is &quot;when you are done&quot; - children aren&#39;t ever really *done* playing, <br/>
and often will multitask in their play and have several different <br/>
things going on at the same time. My 5yr old will sometimes have a <br/>
project of game involving toys that lasts for several days, even <br/>
though she will leave it for hours at a time to do other things. <br/>
Asking kids to clean up on *our* schedule undermines their natural <br/>
process of discovery. If your husband were rebuilding an engine, <br/>
would you ask him to put it back in the car before he came in for <br/>
lunch? He&#39;d probably respond with a pretty darn &quot;snotty tone&quot; if you <br/>
did ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-302245683">Give her two choices that you can live with so that<br/>
she feels empowered and yet you feel in control.<br/>
<br/>
For example: &quot;we take quiet time at 1:00 or 2pm, which<br/>
would you prefer?&quot; OR &quot;quiet reading time is going to<br/>
be 1 hour or 1.5 hours..would you like to set the oven<br/>
time to one?&quot; If you express that she has a choice she<br/>
will be less likely to fight or pressure you. <br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This can be a useful *step* in transitioning away from a more <br/>
controlling parenting style, but it still conceptualizes parent-<br/>
child interactions as revolving around a locus of control (either <br/>
mom in control -or- kid in control). Ultimately, radical unschooling <br/>
involves a shift in thinking away from the whole &quot;who&#39;s in control&quot; <br/>
question entirely. <br/>
<br/>
Another way of thinking about this, is: why only two choices? Sure, <br/>
you don&#39;t want to bombard a young child with more options than she <br/>
can handle, but you also don&#39;t want to limit *yourself* to only a <br/>
couple of options. This is going back to the rules-vs-principles <br/>
idea.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; For example: &quot;we take quiet time at 1:00 or 2pm, which<br/>
&gt; would you prefer?&quot; OR &quot;quiet reading time is going to<br/>
&gt; be 1 hour or 1.5 hours.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>To me, this looks like &quot;lets make a rule&quot; - but what is the *why* <br/>
behind these statements? Personally, I&#39;d state the underlying <br/>
priciple as: Everyone&#39;s Needs are Important. Okay, so if mom needs a <br/>
break what are some other ways mom can get the time she needs <br/>
without setting some rather arbitrary limits? A movie, a bath, or a <br/>
trip to the playground could all, potenitally, meet the child&#39;s <br/>
needs while still honoring mom&#39;s, without any kind of arbirary <br/>
limits being set. <br/>
<br/>
With a younger child, it isn&#39;t necessary to lay those all out as <br/>
possible choices, either. There&#39;s a certain amount of prediction and <br/>
understanding that comes from knowing our kids - my 5yr old is <br/>
unlikely to want a bath, for example, so *I* wouldn&#39;t offer one in <br/>
the hopes of getting some down time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1312089445">--Thanks for the help and posts. THere are some really good <br/>
suggestions, like checking my own tone of voice and being more <br/>
available in the momment to the kids.<br/>
<br/>
However, sometimes it sounds like parents here realy are just all <br/>
permissive...and feel that everything their kids do...is because of <br/>
you as parents...not listening or being in tune with your kids. I <br/>
have a hard time buying that. Sometimes kids steal toys away or hit <br/>
because they just want to toy! I am still not sure not taking any <br/>
action is the answer. I have been down on the floor playing with the <br/>
kids when this stuff has happened...not always but often. It happens <br/>
quickley...right before my eyes...I could not have prevented it!<br/>
BUt what to do ...WHEN it happens is more my question here. Doing <br/>
nothing..or just suggesting over and over until you are blue in the <br/>
face...not respectful..how would you feel if...this does not seem to <br/>
work long term. I will read more books though.<br/>
I did read &quot;Unconditional Parenting&quot; which I liked..but he never <br/>
gave much at all in the way of handling certain situations that we <br/>
all run accross..so while on paper it sounds great..not sure how <br/>
practical it really is.<br/>
JUst my thoughts.<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and feel that everything their kids do...is because of<br/>
&gt; you as parents...not listening or being in tune with your kids.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think everything kids do is because of their level of  <br/>
understanding, their skills, and their emotional maturity.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Sometimes kids steal toys away or hit<br/>
&gt; because they just want to toy!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because they don&#39;t have the skills or the ability to not react to an  <br/>
emotion.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t help the relationship to jump to the conclusion the child  <br/>
is selfish and mean. Think about when you&#39;ve made  a mistake and  <br/>
someone made the assumption you did it deliberately. How did you  <br/>
feel? Doesn&#39;t it make you angry? And then the focus moves from  <br/>
finding better ways to solve something to defending yourself.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am still not sure not taking any<br/>
&gt; action is the answer.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No one has ever said don&#39;t take action. The actions people here will  <br/>
help others away from are anger and punishment and actions that  <br/>
interfere with relationship building.<br/>
<br/>
If a child needs something, they need help getting it, not anger that  <br/>
they&#39;re doing it wrong. They need reminding that hitting isn&#39;t  <br/>
acceptable.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I could not have prevented it!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some situations can be averted by being aware of tension building up  <br/>
and calling one child away or finding something new to do.<br/>
<br/>
But sometimes the actions come out of no where. The goal isn&#39;t to  <br/>
stop kids from hitting -- that will happen as a side effect -- but to  <br/>
help them find ways that are better, that aren&#39;t hurtful.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; BUt what to do ...WHEN it happens is more my question here. Doing<br/>
&gt; nothing..or just suggesting over and over until you are blue in the<br/>
&gt; face...not respectful..how would you feel if...this does not seem to<br/>
&gt; work long term.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If it&#39;s happening over and over, she&#39;s too young to control her  <br/>
impulses. You can&#39;t teach her skills she&#39;s not ready to handle any  <br/>
more than you can teach a 6 mo to walk. It will happen with time.<br/>
<br/>
In the mean time, be aware of their tension level. Keep them out of  <br/>
reach of each other. Arrange breaks with each other.<br/>
<br/>
It also sounds like she&#39;s jealous. She was the baby in the family and  <br/>
suddenly she&#39;s been displaced by something that the parents find  <br/>
newer and better. It&#39;s like a death has occurred in her life and  <br/>
everyone expects her to be happy about it and be nice to what has  <br/>
displaced her.<br/>
<br/>
A really good book is Siblings Without Rivalry. It&#39;s a very easy read.<br/>
<br/>
Until you can get inside her head and understand the total upheaval  <br/>
you&#39;ve imposed on her life and see what it looks like and feels like  <br/>
from inside her, you&#39;re going to have a hard time responding in ways  <br/>
that make sense to her.<br/>
<br/>
The traditional way is to *make* them think right. They *need* to get  <br/>
over the feeling the baby&#39;s an interloper and start to like it. Which  <br/>
causes huge breakdowns in relationships and only makes the behavior  <br/>
worse.<br/>
<br/>
How would you feel if your husband brought a new wife home? What if  <br/>
he got angry that you wouldn&#39;t embrace her with as much happiness as  <br/>
he had? Would that make you warmer towards her?<br/>
<br/>
 From your daughter&#39;s point of view there was no reason you would  <br/>
bring another child into the house. You had her. Why would you need  <br/>
another? And yet you did. And you&#39;ve been upset that she hasn&#39;t  <br/>
thought it was a great thing.<br/>
<br/>
What she needs is sympathy and understanding. She needs to feel that  <br/>
it&#39;s okay to feel displaced.<br/>
<br/>
Think of it this way: If it were raining and she was upset because  <br/>
she wanted to go outside, would it be better to get frustrated with  <br/>
her upsetness because there was nothing anyone could do about it and  <br/>
she&#39;d just better accept it, or to sympathize and talk about what a  <br/>
great time it could have been?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I did read &quot;Unconditional Parenting&quot; which I liked..but he never<br/>
&gt; gave much at all in the way of handling certain situations that we<br/>
&gt; all run accross..so while on paper it sounds great..not sure how<br/>
&gt; practical it really is.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because  a lot of it is a change in perspective. Seeing the  <br/>
situations with new eyes rather than applying solution x to situation  <br/>
y. It&#39;s being aware of the causes of the behavior and rearranging  <br/>
what and how you do things to bring the tension level down.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I mean..how does one<br/>
&gt; handle it when your child smacks, or kicks a sibling, or rips a toy<br/>
&gt; from her hand,talks in that snotty tone of voice, etc etc. You can<br/>
&gt; say it is disrespectful to her..,etc etc..but she could care less.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>By reading Siblings Without Rivalry! And Sandra Dodd&#39;s website.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest help you can give her is changing your overall treatment  <br/>
towards her. The more you fill her up, the less she&#39;ll feel a need to  <br/>
steal what used to be hers from her sister. See her as the displaced  <br/>
wife who is still pissed after all these years and *help* her find  <br/>
ways to be happy.<br/>
<br/>
You need to be aware that these tensions exist and steer the kids  <br/>
away from situations where the anger builds up. Call her away for  <br/>
important things like to help you make lunch or to put some clothes  <br/>
away upstairs.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also, how can someone say that a LIMIT and a contract regarding<br/>
&gt; it..such as staying up late as long as they are not loud and waking<br/>
&gt; others is any different to another person who says you can play with<br/>
&gt; any toys you want, as long as when you are done, you clean up or put<br/>
&gt; it away??<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because of the way kids view the world. When they&#39;re really young,  <br/>
they are less likely to understand being quiet for someone else but  <br/>
the more their needs are treated with respect, the more they  <br/>
reciprocate. When they know others are working hard to help them get  <br/>
what they need, they feel the same towards others. (When they&#39;re old  <br/>
enough.) When people&#39;s needs are filled to the brim and are  <br/>
overflowing, there&#39;s no need to be mean and fight with others for  <br/>
limited resources.<br/>
<br/>
Right now your older daughter feels that attention and love are  <br/>
limited resources and she needs to eliminate the rival to get as much  <br/>
as she needs.<br/>
<br/>
Arrange to take her out on her own occasionally, just the two of you.  <br/>
Talk about how hard it is to have a little sister. Talk about the fun  <br/>
parts too. Everything has a good and bad side! There&#39;s a big  <br/>
difference between finding ways to be positive and cope with a bad  <br/>
situation, and pretending there&#39;s no bad part and it&#39;s all good.  <br/>
That&#39;s where she is right now. She&#39;s seeing all the bad parts and  <br/>
from her point of view you&#39;re saying &quot;La de da, isn&#39;t life grand!  <br/>
(Except for when you misbehave.)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; To me it is the same . We have a smaller home all on one<br/>
&gt; level and so it is important for us to be able to live/move around<br/>
&gt; in the home when the toys are picked up and not scattered all over<br/>
&gt; all day!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, it&#39;s important to *you*. That&#39;s a really really important mental  <br/>
shift to make that will help you understand what we&#39;re talking about  <br/>
and help you start building relationships rather than contributing to  <br/>
the tension. You will improve your relationship immensely if you can  <br/>
see that just because you are certain something is important (and  <br/>
sensible!) that not everyone is going to feel that way. And the  <br/>
sooner you accept that it&#39;s important to you and you alone and  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t be imposed on someone else, the less tension there will be  <br/>
around it and the better your relationship with be.<br/>
<br/>
If your husband loved football, would it help if he insisted that you  <br/>
watch? Would it help if he made you watch until you understood how  <br/>
important football is?<br/>
<br/>
You can invite them to help. (And treat it as help a friend might  <br/>
give.) You can ask them to do specific tasks. (Could you put the red  <br/>
truck in the bin for me?) You can turn things into games. (Others  <br/>
will have other suggestions.) All are relationship building and don&#39;t  <br/>
build a negative atmosphere around cleaning.<br/>
<br/>
