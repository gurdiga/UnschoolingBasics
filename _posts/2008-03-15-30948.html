<div id="ygrps-yiv-1316226590">OK...kid #3 Morgan 3.5 yrs old, home 10 weeks.  Mostly she&#39;s OK with<br/>
the pets now.  But every now and again....<br/>
<br/>
I was standing there with her and in the blink of an eye she ran over<br/>
and kicked my 13lb Dachsund in the throat.  I *LOST* it.  I can handle<br/>
her breaking things, or throwing tantrums (which she really doesn&#39;t do<br/>
she just lets me know she&#39;s frustrated.)  But my pets...I just can&#39;t<br/>
handle animal abuse.  And yeah I know she doesn&#39;t understand the<br/>
concept of abuse.  But in the moment...what should I do?  Because I<br/>
just yelled at her very loudly.  I was so mad.  My husband just took<br/>
her for a walk and I vacuumed the house which helps calm me down.<br/>
<br/>
I know I blew it.  I need some tool to help me with the pets.  This is<br/>
the one thing I can&#39;t just giggle about and say &quot;Oh well!  She&#39;ll<br/>
learn!&quot;  And NO I&#39;m not rehoming my pets.  That&#39;s a no go option.  I&#39;m<br/>
not asking for how to keep her from doing this, because it&#39;s pretty<br/>
infrequent and I know as she gains more understanding it will stop.<br/>
What I&#39;m asking for is what do *I* do in the moment, what&#39;s the<br/>
override button?  My pets are as important to me as she is.  I take<br/>
pet ownership seriously.  So this is like my other big<br/>
conundrum...when the boys are fighting and they are hurting each other<br/>
either physically or verbally.  I feel like so much of this<br/>
unschooling stuff would be seamless with just one kid but, I stumble<br/>
over these kinds of conflicts and I SO blew it just now.<br/>

you&#39;re not! You reacted, you didn&#39;t respond. It&#39;s human. <br/>
 <br/>
How about, if this happens again, you go, calmly, pick up the dog, and talk  <br/>
softly to the dog about how M didn&#39;t meant to hurt you and she&#39;s just <br/>
learning.  Pet the dog, be loving, and show M how to do the same thing, while talking  <br/>
softly to her too saying the same things....? <br/>
 <br/>
I know she&#39;s adjusting - I love reading your updates, Karen. I have a  friend <br/>
that is trying to adopt a daughter from China and I always think of her  when <br/>
I read your posts - and of you, when I read her&#39;s. <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t know if that will help, but maybe it will. <br/>

so hard because I love them both! It just blows my top when I see them <br/>
hurting each other.Most of the time they are best friends, but a couple <br/>
of times a year they have a major blowout. <br/>
 <br/>
I also need to know how others handle this type of thing.<br/>

I&#39;ll second what the other Karen said. ;)<br/>
<br/>
In that moment, tend to your dog with as much love and compassion as you can<br/>
muster, let that emotion take the place of the rage that may be present.<br/>
Pour all of that attention into your hurt dog, and let her see that you<br/>
really care about the safety of every living thing in your house.  And the<br/>
beauty is, you can do this without a single &quot;you shouldn&#39;t have done that&quot;<br/>
lecture.  She&#39;ll see it and get it on a deeper level than words can convey.<br/>
And always follow it up with a hug for her, no words, just a hug or some<br/>
other loving gesture that sends the message that your love for her will not<br/>
change because of xyz.  Maybe that&#39;s what she&#39;s testing?  Hmmm, that thought<br/>
just popped into my head.<br/>
<br/>
I do this with my children, too, by the way.  If one of them hurts the<br/>
other, instead of being mean and icky to the one who did the hurting, I rush<br/>
over to the hurt child and wrap my arms around him.  Both (sometimes all 3!)<br/>
children are usually within pretty close proximity, so I&#39;ll wrap my arms<br/>
around the other(s), as well.  Love heals.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and remember to BREATHE!  Especially in that moment of feeling like<br/>
you&#39;re about to lose it!  Breathing always, always, always helps!<br/>

way to set up our world so it won&#39;t happen again. If you don&#39;t learn  <br/>
from it, that is real failure. If you learn from it - it is a minor  <br/>
screwup.<br/>
<br/>
So - pets and Morgan might not be a good mix for a lot of years.  <br/>
Speaking from experience with a child with serious attachment issues  <br/>
(abused and fostered, etc), she really did not have empathy even for  <br/>
humans, and pretty much none for animals. So she could be a risk to  <br/>
the animals for a lot of years to come.<br/>
<br/>
I, personally, would not HAVE animals and bring in a little child with  <br/>
the background yours has. I know you love your pets, and to tell you  <br/>
to give them away so they can live in a safer home probably seems like  <br/>
overreaction to you, but, that&#39;s my honest answer and ESPECIALLY if  <br/>
her being rough with them is going to be a trigger for you to snap.<br/>

Well, it is not that simple to find good homes so rehoming isn&#39;t just<br/>
a matter of &quot;free to a good home&quot; but additionally, I have other<br/>
children who love these animals.  How does it respect them to say &quot;OK<br/>
so we are bringing in this kid, so we have to ship out your pets.&quot;<br/>
And if we should be considerate of all members of the household, how<br/>
do I (were I so inclined to do so) respect my other children while<br/>
ripping their hearts out?  How can I say to them &quot;Because of Morgan<br/>
this is what we have to do.&quot; without engendering dislike and<br/>
resentment for the new child?  I don&#39;t see how that will lead to my<br/>
boys feeling good at all.  And I don&#39;t think that&#39;s black and white<br/>
thinking.  I think knowing my kids and how they feel, this would be<br/>
incredibly destructive to our relationship...not to mention sending<br/>
the message that &quot;If an animal is inconvenient, just dump it, they are<br/>
things not beings.&quot;  AND Yeager is my service dog, I can not be<br/>
without him.  Well I could, but my life and ability to be independent<br/>
would be severely limited.<br/>
<br/>
But the question wasn&#39;t about pet/kid control that I can do.  The<br/>
question was, when there is a trigger that you can&#39;t eliminate, how do<br/>
*you* *me* *anyone* IN THE MOMENT deal with that?  What&#39;s the better<br/>
way?  Because as I said, the other trigger is my boys fighting.  I<br/>
can&#39;t get rid of one kid to bring peace.  So simply removing the<br/>
source of the problem is not always the answer.  I feel as though the<br/>
answer to being more gentle will come from within me.  I&#39;m sure there<br/>
are others of you that had to learn different patterns for behavior<br/>
you couldn&#39;t control in others.  What are your recommendations for<br/>
those situations?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-908439605">I haven&#39;t read the rest yet, Karen, but I will in a minute. Before I  <br/>
do, I wanted to respond to the tone of this part.<br/>
<br/>
Do you really think I recommended what you said here? Would I say to  <br/>
my kids, &quot;Ok, so we&#39;re bringing in this kid, so we have to ship out  <br/>
your pets?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;ll help you a lot in these conversations if you slow down and think  <br/>
more about what you&#39;re reading. You&#39;ve read quite a bit of what I&#39;ve  <br/>
said here, to you and others. Is this in line with other things you&#39;ve  <br/>
read? Remember, I have NOTHING to gain here - I&#39;m only here to be  <br/>
helpful. Don&#39;t resist; think about the sentiments, the underlying  <br/>
principles, the reasoning behind what we&#39;re offering to you.<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t exactly and specifically solve your problems for you. We can  <br/>
give you our ideas, we can analyze what you tell us. That gives you a  <br/>
variety of ideas, but the solutions are going to have to come from  <br/>
you, not from us.<br/>
<br/>
You chose to adopt Morgan. Did you just say, &quot;So we&#39;re bringing in  <br/>
this kid?&quot; Did you AND your other kids make this decision together?  <br/>
Did they understand that they would be making sacrifices because of  <br/>
it? I do know a family that says, &quot;This is NONE of my kids&#39; business,  <br/>
they have nothing to say about us adopting more children.&quot; Their  <br/>
argument was that kids don&#39;t have anything to say about it if their  <br/>
mother gets pregnant, and adoption should be like that. If you chose  <br/>
that route, then I guess, yeah, it is just a logical extension to say,  <br/>
&quot;...so we have to ship out your pets.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t recommend handling any of it that way from the adoption to  <br/>
how to deal with problems with pets.<br/>
<br/>
Surely, upon second thought, you realize that is not what I was  <br/>
saying, right? So maybe read what I wrote again, but with the question  <br/>
in your mind of, &quot;How can these ideas be translated into something  <br/>
workable in my life?&quot; Don&#39;t close your mind to them - don&#39;t build up  <br/>
your defenses because someone says something you didn&#39;t want to hear.  <br/>
As soon as someone starts saying, &quot;That won&#39;t work because....&quot; and  <br/>
then listing all the reasons it won&#39;t work, I&#39;m usually pretty sure  <br/>
they really know that there is something to it, but they don&#39;t want to  <br/>
admit it even to themselves.<br/>

<br/>
I did reread what you wrote and you acknowledge that I wouldn&#39;t think<br/>
giving my pets away would be a good idea but that is the idea you have<br/>
to offer.  I know not everyone will be able to offer advice that will<br/>
work in every situation.  I understand that.  But I did say rehoming<br/>
was a no-go.  I&#39;m having trouble with my husband but I wouldn&#39;t kick<br/>
him out.  The boys fight, but I wouldn&#39;t get rid of one of them.  My<br/>
commitment to my pets is as strong as my commitment to my husband and<br/>
children.  They are not less than.  I know not everyone feels that<br/>
way...I work in rescue and have worked with animals for two decades.<br/>
I know how easily people toss animals when they become a pain or less<br/>
than cute etc.  (I&#39;m not saying you feel that way.)  My level of<br/>
commitment to my animals is very very high and I hope my kids grow up<br/>
to feel the same way.  Animals are not disposable.  Not in my house.<br/>
<br/>
As to the adoption yes, we did talk to the boys about it but there<br/>
isn&#39;t any way that it was a fair discussion.  How would a child even<br/>
grasp how life would change?  They can&#39;t really.  But they knew about<br/>
the adoption and we talked and talked about it and they discussed it<br/>
with others and us too.  For 2 years.  But at no point did I ever<br/>
entertain that my animals would have to go because I was bringing a<br/>
new child into the house.  It&#39;s simply not going to happen.  I know<br/>
it&#39;s not unschooly and likely ruffling feathers but in this case the<br/>
child MUST change.  This is no different in my mind than if she was<br/>
hurting the boys.  I wouldn&#39;t get rid of them.  Life would have to go<br/>
on and the attacker would have to stop being violent.  That&#39;s just the<br/>
way it would have to be.  And that&#39;s the way it is.<br/>
<br/>
HOWEVER...this happened because she&#39;s 3.  Not because she&#39;s adopted.<br/>
And she will grow out of it/through it.  She is already lots better<br/>
than she was 8 weeks ago.  She enjoys Otis and they play together a<br/>
lot.  Yeager and she are buddies.  It will get better.<br/>
<br/>
RE: my reaction, I&#39;m still moving from a place of &quot;do it wrong and<br/>
you&#39;ll get punished&quot; to one where there is no punishment.  My default<br/>
reaction is punishment.  I was hoping there would be perhaps a short<br/>
cut to changing the default reaction but I see that isn&#39;t possible.<br/>
It&#39;s going to take some time and I will mess up.  The important thing<br/>
is that I recognized I made a mistake, and am committed to not letting<br/>
it happen again.  And I realize that my posting here is to own my<br/>
mistake and keep myself accountable to a group of people who are all<br/>
parenting like I *want* to parent.  It would be very easy to be here<br/>
on this list and read and post and do whatever I wanted to with the<br/>
kids.  But I really do want to change and have Morgan grow up in a<br/>
calm environment and I want my boys to be more at peace.<br/>
<br/>
And even though I will not rehome my pets, I do appreciate the time<br/>
you took to answer my query.  Even when the idea isn&#39;t one I can use,<br/>
I still learn.<br/>

to changing. You can&#39;t expect to change overnight and all of a sudden <br/>
deal with every difficult situation perfectly. You can, however, take <br/>
each situation as it comes and try to consciously remind yourself of <br/>
how you want to be. It is ok to stop yourself in the middle of a snap. <br/>
If you find yourself reacting in a way that you don&#39;t like, you don&#39;t <br/>
have to follow it through to the end. <br/>
<br/>
One thing I&#39;ve done is ask my husband to say something to me if he <br/>
ever sees me about to lose it. This happened just the other day when <br/>
my 4 year old snapped me in the back of my neck with a measuring tape. <br/>
I had no idea he was behind me doing that and it shocked me. My <br/>
immediate reaction was to spin around ready to hit back without even <br/>
really realizing what had happened. All I knew was something hit me <br/>
and it hurt. My husband said my name very sharply and it stopped me in <br/>
my tracks. I was very thankful to him for that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-880743760">I have an idea-  you have to always be around her when she is around <br/>
the animal so you can protect the dog(?)- do not let her be near <br/>
them without supervision until she can be gentle- <br/>
<br/>
same for the boys fighting- you need to be there before it gets out <br/>
of hand- before it is &quot;fighting&quot; you need to anticipate it will <br/>
happen and step in quickly<br/>
<br/>
that way you will temper &quot;your&quot; reaction but not letting things get <br/>

Have you talked to your other children about the danger that their pets are<br/>
in?  About other options for the safety and care of said pets?  Maybe they&#39;d<br/>
have some ideas they&#39;d love to share, if asked.  Maybe one of *them* would<br/>
suggest &quot;loaning&quot; them out to a family close by until things were easier for<br/>
Morgan.  Maybe you could find a family that would be willing to foster your<br/>
pets, you pay for the food and other expenses, and having visiting rights<br/>
whenever you&#39;d like, or bring them to your home for occasional<br/>
weekend/overnight visits.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe your other children would much rather help their pets out, for the<br/>
time being at least, than have the possibility of injury and all of the<br/>
other stress that comes from worrying about the pets safety.<br/>

<br/>
I was standing there with her and in the blink of an eye she ran over<br/>
and kicked my 13lb Dachsund in the throat.  I *LOST* it.  I can handle<br/>
her breaking things, or throwing tantrums (which she really doesn&#39;t do<br/>
she just lets me know she&#39;s frustrated.)  But my pets...I just can&#39;t<br/>
handle animal abuse.  And yeah I know she doesn&#39;t understand the<br/>
concept of abuse.  But in the moment...what should I do?  Because I<br/>
just yelled at her very loudly.  I was so mad.  My husband just took<br/>
her for a walk and I vacuumed the house which helps calm me down.<br/>
<br/>
I know I blew it.  I need some tool to help me with the pets.  This is<br/>
the one thing I can&#39;t just giggle about and say &quot;Oh well!  She&#39;ll<br/>
learn!&quot;  And NO I&#39;m not rehoming my pets.  That&#39;s a no go option.  I&#39;m<br/>
not asking for how to keep her from doing this, because it&#39;s pretty<br/>
infrequent and I know as she gains more understanding it will stop.<br/>
What I&#39;m asking for is what do *I* do in the moment, what&#39;s the<br/>
override button?  My pets are as important to me as she is.  I take<br/>
pet ownership seriously.  So this is like my other big<br/>
conundrum...when the boys are fighting and they are hurting each other<br/>
either physically or verbally.  I feel like so much of this<br/>
unschooling stuff would be seamless with just one kid but, I stumble<br/>
over these kinds of conflicts and I SO blew it just now.<br/>
<br/>
Karen *feeling like a bad person but would like no one to tell me I&#39;m<br/>
a bad person I feel bad enough about this already.*<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Frankly, I probably would have done the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
Then I would have taken that breath---*after* the fact. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Taking on a three year old is so completely different than starting as <br/>
an infant. There&#39;s a reason we naturally get them when they don&#39;t DO <br/>
much of anything: so we can grow WITH them to make changes that will <br/>
make life easier as we all grow. &lt;G&gt; Suddenly having a three year old <br/>
isn&#39;t easy! And a three year old with little to no empathy is even <br/>
tougher.<br/>
<br/>
I would keep the animals separated from her for a while. Baby gates are <br/>
helpful. Only have the dogs with her when you are RIGHT there where you <br/>
can control the situation. She certainly shouldn&#39;t be left alone with <br/>
them unsupervised for a long, long while.<br/>
<br/>
After a while, she&#39;ll learn *how* to treat the animals. The problem is <br/>
that she&#39;s had NO experience with animals. And the experience she&#39;s had <br/>
with humans has been spotty, at best. But she needs more time watching <br/>
*you* and your boys interact with the dogs.<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that, although *we* consider it abuse, she was just seeing <br/>
what would happen if she kicked the dog. Had she been *born* to you, <br/>
she would have had months and months of seeing proper treatment of dogs <br/>
before she could ever even *walk*! I doubt it was malicious; it was <br/>
probably just an experiment! &quot;What happens if I do THIS?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In the big scheme of things, a little yelling will NOT scar her. It may <br/>
have made a huge impression though---especially of that&#39;s not the norm <br/>
around your house. When I yell now (NOT several years ago before <br/>
unschooling!), it&#39;s a damned big deal---and everyone knows I&#39;m upset <br/>
and out of control---so they take it seriously. In a home where yelling <br/>
and hitting *are* normal, then yelling and hitting are ---just that: <br/>
Normal---and nothing to get upset about (that didn&#39;t some out quite <br/>
right, but it&#39;s not seen as OHMYGODMOMISOUTOFCONTROL!). I know a lot of <br/>
kids who just &quot;tune out&quot; the yelling. They don&#39;t even notice it.<br/>
<br/>
I essentially HAVE one kid(s) (eight years apart), so I *can* <br/>
concentrate on one at a time. So I&#39;m worthless in helping you figure <br/>
out what to do with multiples. &lt;g&gt; But I *do* know all about crates as <br/>
safe havens for dogs! The dogs should not be in range of a hitting <br/>
toddler. I just put mine up if I think a guest child will not be able <br/>
to restrain himself. I&#39;m sure the dogs and cats appreciate it---even if <br/>
they don&#39;t know why. &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t look at this as the end of the world. Look at it as a <br/>
*learning-take* for both you and Morgan. She learned that you go <br/>
ballistic if she kicks the dog (that could be good OR bad, depending!). <br/>
You learned that she is interested in interacting with dogs---and not <br/>
always well. You learned not to leave her alone with (or at least <br/>
within kicking distance of) the dog. You learned that it freaks you out <br/>
more than you thought. *Knowing* that, you can make adjustments as they <br/>
come up again (and I&#39;m sure they will! &lt;G&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Keep them separated unless you can be *right* there. The good thing is <br/>
that she will probably catch on sooner because she *is* older and she <br/>
sees gentleness modeled *for* her.<br/>
<br/>
But don&#39;t beat yourself up. You&#39;ve learned some good things! &lt;G&gt; Now <br/>
you can do better next time. Live and Learn, right?<br/>

She is doing so much better with the animals than she did 8 weeks ago<br/>
and much better than I had expected she would.  And as far as the<br/>
yelling, well since she was abused, yelling means nothing to her<br/>
except that she *noticed* that her action caused an extreme reaction<br/>
from me.  She didn&#39;t cry or anything.  She wasn&#39;t even upset.  If<br/>
you&#39;ve been beat with a broom stick, yelling isn&#39;t that big of a deal<br/>
I guess.  I was abhored at my reaction because I&#39;m trying to do<br/>
better.<br/>

And she isn&#39;t ever left alone with the pets, for both of their safety.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-682511553">Karen,<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to chime in in support of what Kelly and Julie said: keep the <br/>
dog separated (via crate or baby gate) and always be right there when <br/>
she is around the dog.<br/>
<br/>
Besides protecting the dog from a three-year old, you are protecting <br/>
her from the dog should it get pushed past its level of tolerance.  Any <br/>
dog will bite when it can&#39;t flee (some sooner than others, but if it <br/>
feels danger and can&#39;t escape, it will eventually defend itself).  <br/>
Imagine if the dog bit your three-year old, the decisions you would <br/>
then be faced with. So in essence you are also protecting the dog from <br/>
consequences that may arise through no fault of its own.<br/>
<br/>
We had two dogs, one of which was a Weimaraner with aggressive <br/>
tendencies.  We didn&#39;t know that when we rescued him from backyard <br/>
breeders, and when we had young kids, we had to keep him separated from <br/>
the kids.  I worked with behaviorists and T-Touch therapists for years <br/>
and he became an outside dog to protect both dog and child.  We found <br/>
he was happier outside; the noise and antics of the kids annoyed him.  <br/>
I&#39;m not saying you should put the dog outside, just that it&#39;s easy to <br/>
take a dog&#39;s gentleness for granted and I&#39;d hate to see the dog put <br/>
into a situation in which it feels a need to defend itself.<br/>

floor and whining because she and I have communication problems. I&#39;ve<br/>
made signs and such for her but as her knowledge base grows she will<br/>
want things I don&#39;t have representations for so it results in her and<br/>
I being frustrated for a time until she either figures out how to tell<br/>
me what she wants or I guess what it is. Most of the time, just<br/>
watching her is enough for me to read her and I know what she wants.<br/>
So they aren&#39;t frequent. She does really well, and hasn&#39;t had a full<br/>
blown melt down since home 4 days. So that&#39;s really good for any 3 yr<br/>
old!<br/>

&gt; &gt; I was standing there with her and in the blink of an eye she ran over<br/>
&gt; &gt; and kicked my 13lb Dachsund in the throat. I can handle<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; her breaking things, or throwing tantrums (which she really doesn&#39;t do<br/>
&gt; &gt; she just lets me know she&#39;s frustrated.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know you stated that she does this out of frustration. I am curious<br/>
&gt; as to how you have surmised that she does this out of frustration?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1449683715">Ok, yes I see what you mean, my 11 month old son will pinch or pull my hair to see me squeal. I agree it is for experimentation and a perfect example of why I say humans are born uncivilized. In your original post you were asking how to handle yourself in this situation eh? I would say for you to convince yourself that this behaviour is natural and to expect it. It really sounds as if you do expect it but somehow got caught off guard when she shifted her behaviour to kicking. I sincerely believe my son would also be a biter in day care had I kept him there because he tries to bite us all the time. He also tries to capture the cats when he sees them, and yes he tries to pinch and pull their hair. The cats are able to handle themselves and I do not have to intervene at all, but if he could catch the dogs I&#39;m sure I would have to intervene, but I am like you, I would not re-home my dogs nor even consider it, I would simply stay diligent in intervening that<br/>
 way I&#39;m never caught off guard thus not losing it. Now someone here has already told you that occasionally losing it will not cause harm, I agree because it is a natural result of being afflicted with emotions and your kids will understand.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Our words can influence the way we see things and affect how we  <br/>
react. Calling someone uncivilized is a negative term.<br/>
<br/>
It helps our relationship with our kids to see them in positive  <br/>
light. In this instance it can be seen that they&#39;re working on  <br/>
acquiring cultural knowledge. (And probably several other positive  <br/>
ways.)<br/>
<br/>
Which brings up your previous discussion but puts it in an  <br/>
unschooling context. My daughter was born with the desire to be  <br/>
social. When she was an infant that social need was overwhelmed by  <br/>
her basic needs. The fewer times I broke her trust that those basic  <br/>
needs would be met (food, sleep, safety) the more energy she had left  <br/>
over to meeting social needs.<br/>
<br/>
Maslow&#39;s Hierarchy of Needs helps make that clearer:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
When people feel secure that their basic needs are met, then they can  <br/>
seek to meet higher order needs.<br/>
<br/>
If I didn&#39;t trust that my daughter had an inherent need to be social,  <br/>
then I would need to train her to be social. There was no fighting  <br/>
against an inherent nature to make her be something she wasn&#39;t  <br/>
already. But I did help her figure out ways to be social so that she  <br/>
didn&#39;t push others away inadvertently while trying to meet her basic  <br/>
needs. I helped her acquire cultural knowledge of how we can be with  <br/>
others so they want to be with us while we seek to meet our own needs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2013282010">I know this is old AND I have not read all of the responses, so I might be repeating things:).<br/>
My first thought is two parts:<br/>
1) Can the animals be put in a place that is safe for them, accessible to the other children, yet not a place your little girl will go? This might be completely impossible but it is a thought. I understand not being willing to give up your pets. I could not either. They are as much my babies as my child is:). I don&#39;t think it would be good for your other children, you, or your animals. <br/>
2)I think everyone loses control at some point. Some things are triggers for me too! When I have felt the loss of control I try to remember to breathe, count (to myself), and remember I am the MOM. I say that many times to myself also:) I mean mom as in the adult who has more of an ability to keep control of myself.<br/>
When I do lose control and blow up, we talk about it. I think it is good to show that you are human, you make mistakes, and yet you can say I am sorry and talk about it. <br/>
I really don&#39;t think we can stop ourselves completely from losing it at times. However we can reduce the amount of times it happens and figure out the best way to &quot;fix&quot; the aftermath of blowing up.<br/>
