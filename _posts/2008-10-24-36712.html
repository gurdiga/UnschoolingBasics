<div id="ygrps-yiv-826151014">To the lady who&#39;s sick of picking up after her daughter...<br/>
<br/>
My nine year old today said to me: &quot;I&#39;ve kind of made an agreement with<br/>
myself that I won&#39;t eat stuff in my bed.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Me: &quot;Why&#39;s that?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Her: &quot;Oh, well, I get heaps of crumbs and it&#39;s a bit uncomfortable to<br/>
sleep.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Me: &quot;Sounds cool.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s much better for her to try it out and figure out how it affects her<br/>
than to just have a rule &quot;Mum says I can&#39;t eat in bed.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2124252780">This made me giggle.  We just ask that they please don&#39;t eat in our bed as we don&#39;t like <br/>
the crumbs...lol<br/>
