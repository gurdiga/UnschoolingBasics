<div id="ygrps-yiv-799418081">&quot;I can understand that you might not be able to imagine it but kids<br/>
who will eat sugar to almost the exclusion of anything else do<br/>
exist. I live with one. For several years, he ate almost nothing<br/>
besides sugar-filled, highly processed food. He went into<br/>
malnutrition while I kept talking to him about nutrition and<br/>
offering options.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m having a really hard time with this one. Not because it&#39;s hard to<br/>
believe a child will eat mostly sweets...I have one of those. But to<br/>
imagine a parent allowing a child to be malnourished just because<br/>
he/she exclusively prefers sweets...that&#39;s just not doing your job!<br/>
Why was he eating only processed foods? Why weren&#39;t you cooking/baking<br/>
things he liked that were sweet AND loaded with nutrition?<br/>
<br/>
There are loads of sweet things with nutritive value.<br/>
<br/>
Heck, we had a casserole, pea salad and layered berry/cream dessert<br/>
for dinner last night. I always put everything out at once, because we<br/>
don&#39;t do the &quot;dessert after dinner&quot; thing. If there is something<br/>
sweet, it&#39;s out with the dinner.<br/>
<br/>
So...Jalen ate about 7 servings of the dessert item. Nothing else.<br/>
Guess what? It has eggs, butter, cream and berries. He&#39;ll be fine.<br/>
There are a million ways to make sure a child gets enough<br/>
nutrition...none of them have to involve coercion or control.<br/>

cinnamon sugar. (they have even started serving sweet potato fries <br/>
with cinnamon sugar at our local cinema!) Or one of DS&#39; <br/>
favorite &quot;treats&quot; - my &quot;super secret short cut sweet potato pie&quot; - <br/>
that came about because pumpkin pie (his favorite) takes about an <br/>
hour to bake. DS didn&#39;t want to wait. We had leftover mashed sweet <br/>
potatoes in the fridge - some graham crackers, a schmeer of sweet <br/>
potatoes and a squirt of whipped cream and voila something very like <br/>
pumpkin pie in seconds - and lots of beta carotene et al in with the <br/>
sweet. Jam thumbprint cookies using whole grain flour and &#39;all <br/>
fruit&#39; type jam (fruit and fruit juice and pectin). <br/>
<br/>
I guess part of it is that sweet doesn&#39;t necessarily equal processed <br/>
white sugar.</div>
