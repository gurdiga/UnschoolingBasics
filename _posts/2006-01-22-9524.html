<div id="ygrps-yiv-1593645184">This was posted at another list I&#39;m on and I couldn&#39;t  help but mess<br/>
with it (the message is really irritating if you&#39;re an AP parent). <br/>
Here&#39;s the original (followed by my version):<br/>
<br/>
THE BIRTH ORDER OF CHILDREN -<br/>
<br/>
Your Clothes:<br/>
1st baby: You begin wearing maternity clothes as soon as your OB/GYN<br/>
confirms your pregnancy.<br/>
2nd baby: You wear your regular clothes for as long as possible.<br/>
3rd baby: Your maternity clothes ARE your regular clothes.<br/>
<br/>
Preparing for the Birth:<br/>
1st baby: You practice your breathing religiously.<br/>
2nd baby: You don&#39;t bother because you remember that last time,<br/>
breathing didn&#39;t do a thing.<br/>
3rd baby: You ask for an epidural in your eighth month.<br/>
<br/>
The Layette:<br/>
1st baby: You pre-wash newborn&#39;s clothes, color-coordinate them, and<br/>
fold them neatly in the baby&#39;s little bureau.<br/>
2nd baby: You check to make sure that the clothes are clean and<br/>
discard only the ones with the darkest stains.<br/>
3rd baby: Boys can wear pink, can&#39;t they?<br/>
<br/>
Worries:<br/>
1st baby: At the first sign of distress-a whimper, a frown-you pick<br/>
up the baby.<br/>
2nd baby: You pick the baby up when her wails threaten to wake your<br/>
firstborn.<br/>
3rd baby: You teach your three-year-old how to rewind the mechanical<br/>
swing. !<br/>
<br/>
Pacifier:<br/>
1st baby: If the pacifier falls on the floor, you put it away until<br/>
you can go home and wash and boil it.<br/>
2nd baby:! When the pacifier falls on the floor, you squirt it off<br/>
with some juice from the baby&#39;s bottle.<br/>
3rd baby: You wipe it off on your shirt and pop it back in.<br/>
<br/>
Diapering:<br/>
1st baby: You change your baby&#39;s diapers every hour, whether they<br/>
need it or not.<br/>
2nd baby: You change their diaper every two to three hours, if<br/>
needed.<br/>
3rd baby: You try to change their diaper before others start to<br/>
complain about the smell or you see it sagging to their knees.<br/>
<br/>
Activities:<br/>
1st baby: You take your infant to Baby Gymnastics, Baby Swing, and<br/>
Baby Story Hour.<br/>
2nd baby: You take your infant to Baby Gymnastics.<br/>
3rd baby: You take your infant to the supermarket and the dry<br/>
cleaner.<br/>
<br/>
Going Out:<br/>
1st baby: The first time you leave your baby with a sitter, you call<br/>
home five times.<br/>
2nd baby: Just before you walk out the door, you remember to leave a<br/>
number where you can be reached.<br/>
3rd baby: You leave instructions for the sitter to call only if she<br/>
sees blood.<br/>
<br/>
! At Home:<br/>
1st baby: You spend a good bit of every day just gazing at the baby.<br/>
2nd baby: You spend a bit of everyday watching to be sure your older<br/>
child isn&#39;t squeezing, poking, or hitting the baby.<br/>
3rd baby: You spend a little bit of every day hiding from the child<br/>
<br/>
Swallowing Coins:<br/>
1st child: When first child swallows a coin, you rush the child to<br/>
the hospital and demand x-rays.<br/>
2nd child: When second child swallows a coin, you carefully watch for<br/>
the coin to pass.<br/>
3rd child: When third child swallows a coin you deduct it from his<br/>
allowance!!<br/>
<br/>
~~~Below is a little bit closer to my journey (though I had a midwife<br/>
for #4, never did unassisted)....those of you that didn&#39;t come into AP<br/>
parenting from the beginning might appreciate this more than those<br/>
that have always done it!!~~~<br/>
<br/>
THE BIRTH ORDER OF CHILDREN -<br/>
<br/>
Your Clothes:<br/>
1st baby: You begin wearing maternity clothes as soon as your OB/GYN<br/>
confirms your pregnancy.<br/>
2nd baby: You wear your regular clothes for as long as possible.<br/>
3rd baby: Your maternity clothes ARE your regular clothes.<br/>
<br/>
Preparing for the Birth:<br/>
1st baby: You practice your breathing and trust the doctor<br/>
2nd baby: You practice your breathing and question everything the<br/>
doctor says<br/>
3rd baby: You know you can get through the birth just fine, that the<br/>
doctors only get in the way, and opt for an unassisted home birth in a<br/>
tub in your living room.<br/>
<br/>
The Layette:<br/>
1st baby: You pre-wash newborn&#39;s clothes, color-coordinate them, and<br/>
fold them neatly in the baby&#39;s little bureau.<br/>
2nd baby: You pre-wash with Dr. Bronners soap and stack them neatly in<br/>
your room.<br/>
3rd baby: You buy mostly organic cotton baby clothing, pre-wash in Dr.<br/>
Bronners and throw them in a basket next to your bed.<br/>
<br/>
Worries:<br/>
1st baby: At the first sign of distress-a whimper, a frown-you pick<br/>
up the baby.<br/>
2nd baby: You don&#39;t wait for the baby to cry or whimper, you take care<br/>
of their needs at all times and buy a sling.<br/>
3rd baby: You wear the baby in a sling from the beginning, so they can<br/>
nurse at will.<br/>
<br/>
Pacifier:<br/>
1st baby: If the pacifier falls on the floor, you put it away until<br/>
you can go home and wash and boil it.<br/>
2nd baby:! You don&#39;t introduce a pacifier, you know it messes with<br/>
breastfeeding and allow the child to find their thumb if needed.<br/>
3rd baby: You breastfeed them so much they don&#39;t need a thumb or pacifier.<br/>
<br/>
Diapering:<br/>
1st baby: You change your baby&#39;s diapers every hour, whether they<br/>
need it or not.<br/>
2nd baby: You switch to clothe diapers and change as needed.<br/>
3rd baby: You try Natural evacuation techniques, decide to go back to<br/>
clothe and let the baby run around naked a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Activities:<br/>
1st baby: You take your infant to Baby Gymnastics, Baby Swing, and<br/>
Baby Story Hour.<br/>
2nd baby: You realize you spent far too much money on worthless<br/>
classes and opt for home products to stimulate their minds<br/>
3rd baby: You realize that if a baby is nurtured and loved, they don&#39;t<br/>
need all those programs at all and trust that growth equals learning.<br/>
<br/>
Going Out:<br/>
1st baby: The first time you leave your baby with a sitter, you call<br/>
home five times.<br/>
2nd baby: You only leave the baby with a family member.<br/>
3rd baby: You take the baby with you everywhere (most likely in a sling).<br/>
<br/>
 At Home:<br/>
1st baby: You spend a good bit of every day just gazing at the baby.<br/>
2nd baby: You spend just as much time watching the baby, but with an<br/>
older sibling joining in with &quot;oohs&quot; and &quot;aaahs&quot;<br/>
3rd baby: You spend lots of quality time interacting with all of your<br/>
children and nurturing their passions, gazing at your baby next to<br/>
your body in the sling.<br/>
<br/>
Swallowing Coins:<br/>
1st child: When first child swallows a coin, you rush the child to<br/>
the hospital and demand x-rays.<br/>
2nd child: When second child swallows a coin, you decide to keep coins<br/>
put up higher and help them play with the money in your presence to<br/>
prevent unsafe useage and make sure they have lots of interesting<br/>
things that are safe to put in their mouths.<br/>
3rd child: When third child swallows a coin you realize you haven&#39;t<br/>
learned much with the first two children about keeping unsafe things<br/>
away from babies and decide to go coinless.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, just kidding. But THREE kids swallowing coins? sheesh.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1969941705">I love your version Ren...I just wish I would have caught on by #3  <br/>
child LOL! My head is so thick it took five kids to get to real  <br/>
attachment parenting. I figure Dan and Avari will be just about  <br/>
right. :-P<br/>
