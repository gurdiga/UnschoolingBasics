<div id="ygrps-yiv-454234657">Hi! <br/>
I have been unschooling/homeschooling 2 boys (6yr and 4yr) for a<br/>
little while now. We have tried the traditional homeschool approach<br/>
and I am exhausted of arguing,pleading,threatening,bribing,coercing,<br/>
my son to &#39;do his school&#39;. I saw a bright, curious, book loving boy<br/>
begin to become negative and distant, so unschooling seems very<br/>
enticing to us. My question is, when/ how do unschooled children come<br/>
to understand that sometimes we need to have the self-discipline to do<br/>
things we may not want to do but need to for various reasons?<br/>
<br/>
My son has no interest in learning how to read(maybe bruised by my<br/>
prodding?) but would have me read to him all day? Does anyone have<br/>
readers that have just learned it this way? I am worried he will never<br/>
learn to read...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any suggestions</div>

I can&#39;t think of anything that I do that I don&#39;t want to do, besides<br/>
pay income tax and that&#39;s on my list of things to stop doing :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll keep this brief because you can search the past messages for tons<br/>
of conversations about reading & readers on this list. The chance that<br/>
your son will *never* learn to read is very slim. At some time or<br/>
another children decide they want to learn to read or they just start<br/>
reading -- 6yrs or 12yrs, but by 16yrs no one knows the difference.<br/>
<br/>
If he wants you to read aloud to him right now, then read every moment<br/>
that he&#39;ll allow you to read...obviously, it&#39;s what he needs right now. <br/>

&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t understand the term self-discipline. I really don&#39;t. Discipline seems to me to come from an external source. Self-discipline always reeks of hair shirts and medieval lessons in piety to me. I wouldn&#39;t consider myself a particularly disciplined person, and yet I manage to do most of what I want to do. I have even managed to change my habits. But it isn&#39;t discipline, it&#39;s choice that makes it possible. <br/>
<br/>
I do things that I may not enjoy. I clean up dog poop in the yard regularly. I do it not because I enjoy the act, but because I enjoy the end result. I like not having crap on shoes and bare feet and not smelling it as I walk through the yard. It isn&#39;t self-discipline that brings me to that decision, it is desire. I want to have a pleasant garden. So, for me, doing things I don&#39;t want to do only happens when I want the outcome of the act. And, actually, I can sometimes even enjoy the process. I used to hate doing the dishes. Really hated it. In the early days of my relationship with David we used to go as long as possible without doing the dishes. It was kind of a waiting game to see who would give in first. I like doing dishes now. I find it peaceful to put my hands in the warm water and stare out the window and make them clean. It is such a calming process. When things are overwhelming I find it very relaxing, or even if things are only mildly crazy it<br/>
 gives me 15 minutes of space. It also produces an end result that I enjoy. At 4 and 6 there isn&#39;t a big sense of time or causality. It is hard to see that doing something unpleasant can lead to something pleasant. Age and time give you perspective. I wouldn&#39;t expect a 6 year old to get that there are things you have to do even if you don&#39;t want to do them. I still don&#39;t get that and I&#39;m 40. But, if there were things that I, the parent, wanted done, like cleaning a room, I would do them. I might invite Simon or Linnaea to help, but I would do them, without resentment, even if they said no. The things that I want done are about me and not about Simon and Linnaea. A clean room is my need not theirs. If they want something done, like having their toys in an order they can cope with, than I am happy to help, or cooking some culinary creation that they dreamt up or desired. I&#39;ll even do the clean up. I figure I get to help make their childhoods joyful, I take<br/>
 that pretty seriously. <br/>
<br/>

I have been unschooling/ homeschooling 2 boys (6yr and 4yr) for a<br/>
little while now. We have tried the traditional homeschool approach<br/>
and I am exhausted of arguing,pleading, threatening, bribing,coercing ,<br/>
my son to &#39;do his school&#39;. I saw a bright, curious, book loving boy<br/>
begin to become negative and distant, so unschooling seems very<br/>
enticing to us.<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
At 6 your son isn&#39;t school age in many place and at 4 your youngest isn&#39;t mandatory school age anywhere I know (ooh, Northern Ireland has a compulsory school age of 4, so I&#39;m wrong). What so you think they require at such young ages that takes arguing, pleading, threatening, bribing and coercing? You haven&#39;t been unschooling if that is what it is taking. Unschooling doesn&#39;t &quot;do school&quot; at its most basic, your list of manipulation argues that you are a long way from basic unschooling. It sounds like you&#39;ve been very intensive to have your son switch from joy to resentment so quickly. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
My son has no interest in learning how to read(maybe bruised by my<br/>
prodding?) but would have me read to him all day? Does anyone have<br/>
readers that have just learned it this way? I am worried he will never<br/>
learn to read...<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
6 to never is a long, long drive. My son is 11 and he isn&#39;t a fluent reader yet. I know children who weren&#39;t fluent until they were 13 or older. And yet you cannot tell them from earlier readers. Maybe that isn&#39;t comforting. Maybe what you want to hear is that unschooling will give you a guaranteed reader by age x. Ther isn&#39;t a guarantee. School doesn&#39;t give you a guaranteed reader by age 18. Unschooling, I think, has a better track record. The difference is that in school you are labelled for not reading by a certain age, in unschooling the label isn&#39;t applied so there is no need to be limited by it. Unschooling can help you to see the glory in the non-reader. Simon listens in ways that I cannot. He pays intense attention to visual and audial information where I look for the written word. I have a really hard time listening to someone read a book, but he can be mesmerized by books on cd and knows exactly what is going on. Playing video games with him is<br/>
 really enlightening, he picks out the clue to the next step so much faster than I do while I try and pick the clue out from text or what I remember from the written word. And he remembers details from conversations that I didn&#39;t catch or don&#39;t remember, he listens. <br/>
<br/>
Not reading early is not a handicap. And 6 is early. Worrying about it and pressing and prodding for it just helps your son to feel like he is stupid or obstinate to not be reading yet. It won&#39;t get him reading any earlier than he&#39;s going to read without you worrying. Actually it might make it later, it might just make him feel like it is something too difficult and too awful and he just can&#39;t do it. Relax and read to him as much as he likes. What a treat for you. Simon prefers having Stephen Fry read to him these days. He can go on and on and on whereas my voice gives in after a few chapters. <br/>

My son is 9 and a half and is reading on his own now.....after being read to for MANY years.  He still loves to be read to, but two weeks ago, found an old b-day present (a book on codes.)  He curled up on the couch for a few hours and was reading it, and then came into the kitchen to me and announced ,&quot;I have to say, Mom, that I&#39;m really reading this book!&quot;  High interest, no pressure from me or anyone else.  Now he&#39;s also into the Captain Underpants books (so funny and 9 yo boyish humor!  I highly recommend them!) and reading them on his own, with the occasional &quot;what&#39;s this word?&quot;, which I tell him.  Just keep reading to your child and telling him words when he asks and if he&#39;s interested.  IMO, 6 is very young!!   It will come in its own time, and maybe not how or when you expect, but when your child is ready.  Have faith and trust. It WILL come!  <br/>
Peace, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1296754957">I want to add to what Schuyler has said here.  I can see that unschooling is<br/>
very new to you by what you&#39;ve written, and I would encourage lots of<br/>
reading about it (here <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/typical">http://sandradodd.com/typical</a> -a very enticing page-<br/>
and here <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/reading">http://sandradodd.com/reading</a> and also here<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/)">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/)</a>.<br/>
<br/>
I have a 5 year old who is reading a bit here and there, hardly fluent but<br/>
he&#39;s reading some.  Where might he have learned to read?  Not much directly<br/>
from me but he *has* been playing on the computer since before he was 3.<br/>
Today he wants to go to park day, and his vision is to have a carnival<br/>
complete with playacting clothes and fake tattoos and marshmallows and<br/>
cotton candy to share with others.  I thought he meant sharing with the<br/>
other kids but he says no.. he wants grownups to dress up too.  He wants a<br/>
real carnival, and he&#39;s ok with letting it be at the park.  He compromised<br/>
on it not being at night time.  There&#39;s a lot more to Karl&#39;s life than<br/>
learning to read.  He&#39;s busy.  Reading is just a part of it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-285890317">Then read, read, read to him, as long as you can!<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t worry about teaching him *to* read; instead, share with him the love <br/>
of reading, and when his brain and spirit are ready, he will start *wanting* <br/>
to decipher the code of reading on his own, in the way that works best for <br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen this first-hand with my own 6 yo son; we tried &quot;learning to <br/>
read&quot; at home but after a little while, he didn&#39;t want to &quot;do school&quot; <br/>
anymore and insisted he couldn&#39;t read. So we stopped official school time <br/>
completely (this was about 8 months ago, after maybe 3 months of &quot;school at <br/>
home&quot; about two hours a week), and that&#39;s around the time I discovered <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
He has always loved stories, books on CD, me reading aloud to him, etc. So <br/>
we kept up with plenty of that. (I enjoy them as well!) Then, other night, <br/>
at, like 9:50 p.m., when noone was sleepy enough to fall asleep, he asked <br/>
for a reading flashlight, cracked open the old reading &quot;textbook&quot; we used to <br/>
use, and read halfway through it, on his own. He was soooooo happy, and <br/>
sooooo proud - it is totally worth it. He&#39;s not lightning speed or perfect, <br/>
but he is thrilled and *wants* to learn more and more and more about <br/>
reading. And he totally owns his ability to read, 100 percent.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a big changed from the whining &quot;I don&#39;t want to do school....&quot; although <br/>
there was certainly a time of &quot;de-schooling&quot; where he had to see that I <br/>
really meant that I was never going to force him to sit down and read again. <br/>
I had to toally drop anything to do with reading for several months. (I <br/>
couldn&#39;t even ask him to read his own name or the word &quot;Go&quot; or anything!! <br/>
LOL!) Luckily, at this young age, they can de-school quickly!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1472382388">You are right. Recently we have been a long way from unschooling, yet<br/>
I look back to what we have done up until we started &#39;schooling&#39; and<br/>
we were unschooling. I didn&#39;t push anything except I tried to be<br/>
enthusiastic about seeking new experiences and provided educational<br/>
toys  all around them. I moved to a very conservative and traditional<br/>
area (Pa) and since have been feeling the pressure from family and<br/>
society to be doing more. <br/>
Where I begin to get nervous with unschooling is when I read of<br/>
parents allowing their kids to watch TV all day. Maybe for some kids<br/>
they would eventually get bored or move on to other things, but my<br/>
kids would sit there ALL day. I just don&#39;t believe that just because<br/>
they are happy watching Spongebob, I should allow it. Maybe I&#39;m<br/>
misunderstanding.<br/>
I&#39;m sure many of you understand the real pressures from society and<br/>
the fears they can encourage. I am not a wimp and am comfortable<br/>
standing apart on many levels. I am admittedly still a little nervous<br/>
about the school thing though. My brother is a teacher and gave me a<br/>
long lecture about &#39;scaffolding&#39; and how children have ages when they<br/>
are sensitive to certain concepts and if the structure is not there<br/>
from the start they will forever have learning difficulties. How do<br/>
Unschoolers feel about the Montessori theory of &#39;sensitive&#39; periods<br/>
when the developing brain is most able to learn certain things (e.i.<br/>
languages)?<br/>
How do unschooled children differ from say, developing nations who<br/>
have no opportunity/ resources for school? Are those children<br/>
unschooled too or is it our communities resources and our parental<br/>
attention that makes the difference?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for the responses and encouragement. I am completely on<br/>
my own here but feel in my heart we are on the right track.</div>

things we may not want to do but need to for various reasons?<br/>
<br/>
*********<br/>
By doing things they want to do and seeing what it takes.<br/>
<br/>
My DS didn&#39;t get his recent 3rd degree black belt because I made him do it. <br/>
<br/>
My DD doesn&#39;t ace her online courses because I make her do it. <br/>
<br/>
Both involve many steps to get to a goal and some of the steps are just plain hard work.<br/>
<br/>
As for reading, if everyone around you is reading, you soon see how useful it is. And, in your own time, you may be demanding to know more about it. That&#39;s how I remember my DD. Standing by my side while I was at the computer one day, completely fed up. &quot;Everyone else can read. I want to know how. Now.&quot; Turned out she knew more than she thought she did and was reading independently after a short while but it was never formally addressed until she wanted more. Vehemently! :) Now, she wants to know when we can go to the library today. (As soon as it stops storming out.)<br/>
<br/>
Your mileage may vary. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1459575309">I agree with this.  My now 10 year old son loves Hardy Boy mysteries and will read for hours.  <br/>
Then I introduced him to Calvin and Hobbes.  He saw it on my bookshelf and asked to read it, <br/>
I said sure but that he *might* want the English versions (although the Spanish is fine <br/>
too....too funny).....He read what I had (Spanish too) and has order everyone the library owns.  <br/>
He will ask when he doesn&#39;t know a word, or look it up himself.  The BIG words lead to him <br/>
starting Treasure Island.  Yes, really.  The unabridged version, he said it HAD to be <br/>
unabridged.  He was worried they would &quot;take out the good words&quot;.  All on his own he does <br/>
this. :)  <br/>
<br/>
He started reading &quot;late&quot; according to public school, we knew he *could* read but he didn&#39;t <br/>
want to....until his younger sister started reading and then he &quot;suddenly&quot; could do it to.  LOL  <br/>
We didn&#39;t push him because we knew he would when he was ready.  This is a child who didn&#39;t <br/>
speak till age 3 (just grunts and pointing) and then in complete long sentences.<br/>
<br/>
His younger sister did everything early--she wanted to catch up with her big brothers. <br/>
Everyone has their own time table.  I just wish the schools would figure that out and leave <br/>
drugs out of the equation.  Ah but there is big money in both I guess...so no school for us.</div>

children off to school or &#39;school at home&#39; -- for those whom don&#39;t<br/>
catch wind of or instinctively hold unschooling principles in their<br/>
hearts from day one. <br/>
<br/>
If children are able to learn to crawl, walk & talk on their own<br/>
(among soooo many other things) before &#39;school age&#39;, then why do we<br/>
treat them like they are magically incapable of learning anything else<br/>
on their own once they reach a certain age?<br/>
<br/>
Where in PA have you moved? We are in Pittsburgh. At some point either<br/>
your family will &#39;get&#39; it or you will have to make it known to them<br/>
that these are your children and if they care about their learning,<br/>
then they can choose to become more supportive or they can back off<br/>
with all the negativity. If your family can not support you and<br/>
interactions are always negative and have you second guessing<br/>
yourself, then limiting interactions with the family is healthy. If<br/>
it&#39;s not possible to limit, then make it clear that homeschooling<br/>
isn&#39;t up for debate.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sure if your children have had limits on their TV time up until<br/>
now, then they would binge and watch TV ALL day long. It is only<br/>
natural for children (and adults) to rebel against arbitrary limits &<br/>
rules. There is obviously something that THEY find valuable in<br/>
Spongebob...maybe you can sit down and watch with them and during<br/>
commercials or after an episode, you can ask them about it their<br/>
favorite parts or why they love that particular episode more than the<br/>
last one. Also, children use TV just like adults  to unwind and tune<br/>
out...if the the rest of their day is full of limits and rules (as<br/>
well as &#39;schooly&#39; pressure) then TV is &#39;heaven&#39;.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll use reading as an example. Children &#39;need&#39; to learn to read by 6,<br/>
because if they don&#39;t, then teachers have a hard time teaching! When a<br/>
student doesn&#39;t read or doesn&#39;t read up to the level YOU &#39;need&#39;, then<br/>
you &#39;have to&#39; do all the work and can&#39;t shovel heaps onto them. In<br/>
school, there are plenty of learning milestones that need to be met,<br/>
if a teacher is to do his/her job. However, we ALL know and talk about<br/>
how every child is different, learns different and on their own time<br/>
table. You can not accurately or fairly compare unschooled children<br/>
(even some homeschooled) to schooled children...when you are not free<br/>
to learn, then you end up being &#39;educated&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How do unschooled children differ from say, developing nations who<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Every culture/country has its own idea of success. Does everyone<br/>
&#39;need&#39; school to meet that idea of success? Can the idea of success be<br/>
changed. When a lot of the world is more concerned about when the next<br/>
meal will take place and whether or not it will, they could care less<br/>
about &#39;school&#39; as you or I know it. I could be wrong, but I do believe<br/>
that most developing countries has at least private schools available<br/>
and even &#39;primative&#39; basic grammar schools...it would be most third<br/>
world countries that have very little to no &#39;school&#39; as we would<br/>
define it.<br/>
<br/>
However, children all over the world (unless they are separated by<br/>
school) learn from their parents what they need to know to build their<br/>
homes, make a fire, hunt (if necessary), sew, cook, basic healing and<br/>
so on. Positive parental attention and involvement always makes a<br/>
difference for the better, no matter where you live. <br/>

is *not* the same as giving them freedom to choose their path. My dd who has<br/>
pneumonia will likely watch TV and or be on the computer all day for the<br/>

necessarily make you an unschooler. Unschooling does NOT equal neglect.<br/>
Actively pursuing life in whatever direction is joyous for you (personally<br/>
and communally) is unschooling. It is finding, making or in some way<br/>
obtaining the resdources you (or you child) needs to have the life you want.<br/>
<br/>
Real life example: My ds 5 discovered Pokemon. We found out the game that<br/>
most of his friends used and got it. He doesn&#39;t read so we played it with<br/>
him. He reaally got into it so we looked for the play books. They contain<br/>
maps, charts, special stuff, etc. We learned/played along with him. He<br/>
wanted more, we found pokemon toys, online game, books to read, dvds, etc.<br/>
We have recently found the card game yu-gi-u through this. NOt only has<br/>
these things broadened his intellectual scope but it shows him we value his<br/>
desires and pursuits. Pokemon is about joy for him.<br/>

Where I begin to get nervous with unschooling is when I read of<br/>
parents allowing their kids to watch TV all day<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Simon spent much of today watching media, youtube more than television, and he watched some videos that I found at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://scribalterror.blogs.com/scribal_terror/nature/index.html">http://scribalterror.blogs.com/scribal_terror/nature/index.html</a> which were funny and cool oh and this one <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX3QCaqLtJ8&e">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX3QCaqLtJ8&e</a> which I got from a blog that I read by Robert Rummel-Hudson about life with his daughter Schuyler who has a genetic disorder called Bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria. He also went outside to run on the newly plowed fields surrounding us and helped to feed the baby mouse that he and Linnaea rescued from one of our cats yesterday. But mostly he&#39;s been watching a couple of different Let&#39;s Play programs on youtube. Linnaea and I watched an Wile Coyote cartoon where he dug through the earth and ended up in China which got me looking for a program that I can remember using where you could dig through the earth and come up on the other side to see where you&#39;d end up from New Mexico or Arizona.<br/>
 Google Earth has a program that lets you do that, so I installed Google Earth and then added the network link that lets you dig through the earth. Turns out you need to be in South America to hit China. All of the Southwest that I explored puts you in the ocean. All of the UK seems to drop you off near New Zealand, but still near some deep sea vents, I imagine. Not very inspiring for a child with a shovel. But really cool to have at my internet fingertips. <br/>
<br/>
I absolutely allow my children watch television all day. Turns out there are very few days when that is all that they do. Even if the television is on in the background there are a lot of other things going on. Eating, drawing, creating, gaming, running after cats, feeding baby mice, having friends over, baking pies, mowing the lawn, dancing DDR, whittling...and it just goes on. If I didn&#39;t allow them television all day, television would become the best thing they got to do that day. It would be the apex of a series of apex-worthy activities. Maybe it is somedays. Maybe the new episode of My Name is Earl trumps swimming or hanging in the hot tub or making apple juice. Yay! Thank you television writers and producers. Because I give them the freedom to choose what they do they don&#39;t have the added benefit/costs of limitations driving their choices. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
Maybe for some kids<br/>
they would eventually get bored or move on to other things, but my<br/>
kids would sit there ALL day. <br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Give them a chance. Some days it is the most engaging thing in our house. Not often. Usually television is most interesting on a day after a day that is really full and engaging and exhausting. Or when there is a new show that they&#39;ve been waiting for coming on. Youtube has ameliorated some of that, but it still is exciting to catch a new episode or a new show. You are doing your children a disservice. You are creating a powerful monster of the box in your living room, or wherever it is in your house. The only things that engage my children for hours and days are things that are really interesting. Television sometimes is that thing. Sometimes it&#39;s books. Linnaea loves the Warrior Cats series and we&#39;ve been reading through those for months now. Simon can get quite focused on a specific video game, the last one was Super Mario Smash Brothers for the Wii. But other things can capture their interest as well. Simon loves story telling. He doesn&#39;t share his<br/>
 stories very often, but he likes to own the things he watches. It is a hugely physical thing and he&#39;s done it for years, 7 years maybe, maybe 8. He will run and move and work through a story and craft the whole thing. He&#39;s currently working on one based on Bakugan, a series that he&#39;s watched much of on youtube. <br/>
<br/>
By limiting television you&#39;ve made it the most interesting thing in the house. You&#39;ve made it super powerful, super strong. It is like the apple of knowledge (or pomegranate, or whatever it was), the very fact of making it forbidden made it more interesting, more sought out. And when they do watch it, seemingly like zombies for hours, you get your proof. Because you know that television is like a drug and will stun your children with it&#39;s e-lectronic rays when they do zone out to it, you have your proof. When you stop thinking of television as the opiate of the masses it will help you to see it as a means of engaging with the world. <br/>
<br/>
We went to the zoo the other day and saw the kangaroos. I mentioned that the male kangaroo has a bifurcated penis, two heads, better than 1. Simon said the female has 3 vaginas. I thought maybe two, but not 3. Nope they have 3 vaginas. He&#39;s right. Yay television!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
I just don&#39;t believe that just because<br/>
they are happy watching Spongebob, I should allow it.<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I love Spongebob. There is so much going on in that cartoon. What is your criteria for letting someone do something? I ask this in all seriousness. Being happy watching Spongebob seems a good reason to watch it. I&#39;ve watched a lot of Spongebob. I love the FUN song. I love that Spongebob becomes a dishwashing sponge on a stick when above the water. I love the way the creators have played with the laws of physics underwater. Its a beautiful show. There are reasons why they might be expected to be happy watching Spongebob. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip?<br/>
My brother is a teacher and gave me a<br/>
long lecture about &#39;scaffolding&#39; and how children have ages when they<br/>
are sensitive to certain concepts and if the structure is not there<br/>
from the start they will forever have learning difficulties.<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My husband is a Senior Lecturer  (read assistant Professor) at a medical school in the UK. It&#39;s a school that uses Problem Based Learning as it&#39;s curricullum. David mentioned tonight while we were making dinner together that doctors from UEA don&#39;t take a lot of hardcore science. They don&#39;t study anatomy unto memorization. It isn&#39;t part of the curricullum. However, when they are tested as doctors, there is no difference in anatomic understanding between those more classically educated and those educated using the more modern approach. Scaffolding is worth questioning. <br/>
<br/>
Okay, I just went and looked up what scaffolding in education is and I got irritated. Scaffolding is when you, the student,  build knowledge through experience based on the rules that a teacher lays out for you. The rules are the scaffolding. But you don&#39;t put scaffolding up around a building as you build it. You put scaffolding up, against an already existing building usually, to work on either a building that is in need of repair or maintenance or to go up higher on a building that you are constructing. But there has to be building in place for there to be scaffolding. I&#39;m sure that it is born from the term foundations in learning. They wanted to stick with the construction industry analogy. Man. It just bothers me. <br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m wrong. David&#39;s experience isn&#39;t relevant. Wikipedia has the best definition I can find of scaffolding: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructional_scaffolding.">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructional_scaffolding.</a> According to the definition I scaffold all the time. I help Simon and Linnaea achieve their goals, engage with their interests by supporting them (which building scaffolding doesn&#39;t do) during the process. I don&#39;t define the building though. I am not a mold that I want them to conform to. They are much more interesting and engaging being their own selves. I certainly don&#39;t want to define or limit them. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
 How do<br/>
Unschoolers feel about the Montessori theory of &#39;sensitive&#39; periods<br/>
when the developing brain is most able to learn certain things (e.i.<br/>
languages)?<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There is probably a time to acquire first language skills. The problem is that anyone who didn&#39;t get it as an infant was in a really screwed up environment and it is hard to figure out if that was the cause of language delays or if it was the not being open to language during the sensitive period. But there isn&#39;t any sensitive period to second language, or it is still debated whether there truly is a sensitive period for second language acquisition. It&#39;s kind of cool thing to research. There is actually still active debate about the degree to which there is a sensitive period to first language acquisition. If the theoreticians are right about that your eldest is beyond the window and your youngest is just about out of it. It might be worth your peace of mind to let go of the notion. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
How do unschooled children differ from say, developing nations who<br/>
have no opportunity/ resources for school? <br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have 3 computers in my home. I have access to lots of museums and art galleries and scientific equipment and theatre and movies and television and food and books and so on and so forth. I live in a world filled with plenty. I share that with my children. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
Are those children<br/>
unschooled too or is it our communities resources and our parental<br/>
attention that makes the difference?<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They are unschooled at the basic level. If not schooling is your level of requirement for unschooling than yes they are unschooled.  Among the Mayans of Belize that David interviewed when he was doing his dissertation fieldwork many had little school experience. Often they could read and do math. They needed those skills when dealing with the people who were buying their crops, so they got them. <br/>

the child has reached the goal (tests).<br/>
<br/>
Learning happens whether those outside the child know it or not.  <br/>
Which makes unschooling scary and frustrating! We want to see it and  <br/>
reassure ourselves that it&#39;s happening.<br/>
<br/>
But kids learn to speak without testing or educational toys. Kids go  <br/>
from not knowing language exists to having it nailed before they  <br/>
reach five. But society dismisses that totally awesome achievement as  <br/>
though it were magical. It&#39;s not. It&#39;s how kids learn: they play  <br/>
around with something, they use it for personally meaningful  <br/>
purposes, they get feedback on how well what they tried worked and  <br/>
they refine their use. And they aren&#39;t even doing that deliberately.  <br/>
It&#39;s how humans are hardwired to learn.<br/>
<br/>
Think about how easy it is for kids to learn to speak without a  <br/>
lesson or test in sight. Think about how hard it is for kids to learn  <br/>
Spanish in school with lots of lessons and tests? Which works better?<br/>
<br/>
And it works for everything a child wants to know. The problem is  <br/>
that it doesn&#39;t look at all like school learning. It looks like  <br/>
playing. It looks like watching TV. It looks like chatting. It looks  <br/>
like messing around.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Where I begin to get nervous with unschooling is when I read of<br/>
&gt; parents allowing their kids to watch TV all day.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t let my daughter watch TV all day. But she had the freedom to  <br/>
choose what she wanted to do. TV was one of the things available.  <br/>
Before 10 she watched a little. Between 10 and 11 she watched a lot.  <br/>
After 11 TV watching dropped off again.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Maybe for some kids<br/>
&gt; they would eventually get bored or move on to other things, but my<br/>
&gt; kids would sit there ALL day.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Kids will watch TV &quot;all day&quot; for several reasons. One common reason  <br/>
is because they know it&#39;s limited. They need to cram it in now while  <br/>
it&#39;s available because they may not be able to get it later. (Very  <br/>
typical adult behavior when adults know a limit is approaching.  <br/>
Happened majorly during past gas crises.)<br/>
<br/>
Another is because it&#39;s the least boring option. If life isn&#39;t  <br/>
sparkly, TV can look like the best option. The problem is that often  <br/>
parents will look around at all the toys and see the kids watching TV  <br/>
and feel as though the TV had some magical drawing power. In some  <br/>
ways maybe it does. I think it fills in a social niche that&#39;s  <br/>
probably missing. My daughter didn&#39;t play often with her stuffed  <br/>
animals unless someone else was over to do it with her.<br/>
<br/>
And another is that during the prepubescent years 10ish to 12ish  <br/>
(give or take) kids are transitioning from kid interests to teen  <br/>
interests. It&#39;s an awkward between stage where it&#39;s hard for them to  <br/>
figure out what interests them. And maybe they also become more  <br/>
subconsciously interested in social relationships so they&#39;re drawn to  <br/>
the drama of social interactions on TV. It&#39;s *very* common for that  <br/>
age to become fascinated by Nikelodeon and Cartoon Network.<br/>
<br/>
And one more is that kids can feel trapped by the programmers&#39;  <br/>
schedule. My daughter (when she was 10-11, found it hard to walk away  <br/>
from cartoons because she didn&#39;t know what she might miss. If we were  <br/>
going out I&#39;d put in a tape for her to record them. More often than  <br/>
not she wouldn&#39;t watch it later. She just needed to feel she had the  <br/>
option to watch or not watch. What helped hugely was getting TiVo so  <br/>
she could program in her favorite shows and watch them whenever she  <br/>
wanted. Her TV watching went *way* down after that (though she was  <br/>
also older and getting beyond the prepubescent stage. I wish we had  <br/>
gotten it a year earlier so I could give a more accurate picture of  <br/>
the effect. But she was showing less TV watching when the programs  <br/>
were taped so I&#39;m speculating that she would have been more  <br/>
discriminating with TiVo.)<br/>

<br/>
Funny thing is that once parents get unschooling, their kids aren&#39;t  <br/>
even coming close to doing the things the parents were sure they  <br/>
would. Kids may do more than the parents would have chosen for them,  <br/>
but they do eventually (once they get past the initial glut period,  <br/>
once they wear out the newness of a new game) do other things. It   <br/>
helps lots if parents aren&#39;t pulling the kids away, but are providing  <br/>
plenty of other opportunities that the kids like as well as or better  <br/>
than a single activity. (But sometimes that single activity *is* what  <br/>
they want to do and the best thing is to keep the door to other  <br/>
things open while they get  what they want from the experience.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I just don&#39;t believe that just because<br/>
&gt; they are happy watching Spongebob, I should allow it. Maybe I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; misunderstanding.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re seeing Spongebob as non-educational. Unschoolers see that  <br/>
enjoyment means they&#39;re getting something they need from it.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one of the hard things to grasp about unschooling. Mainstream  <br/>
society divides the world into play and work. (Learning being lumped  <br/>
in with work.) Unschoolers know that profound learning comes from  <br/>
engagement and fun and enjoyment.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean that we let them go and watch Spongebob until their  <br/>
eyeballs fall out and feel our task is done. Unschooling is about  <br/>
filling their lives with things they enjoy (since enjoyment means  <br/>
learning). Unfortunately that sounds like &quot;keeping them entertained,&quot;  <br/>
but that&#39;s not unschooling. That&#39;s seeing life through Puritanical  <br/>
schoolish eyes where learning is child&#39;s work. Unschooling is  <br/>
recognizing that learning happens when kids are exploring what  <br/>
interests them and makes them happy.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My brother is a teacher and gave me a<br/>
&gt; long lecture about &#39;scaffolding&#39; and how children have ages when they<br/>
&gt; are sensitive to certain concepts and if the structure is not there<br/>
&gt; from the start they will forever have learning difficulties.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Teachers speak with such authority. The speak as though they know  <br/>
everything there is to know about learning.<br/>
<br/>
But not one of them has ever experienced a child who has had the  <br/>
opportunity to learn on their own schedule whatever interests them.<br/>
<br/>
Really think about that. He&#39;s speaking as though he knows that it  <br/>
isn&#39;t possible, but neither he, nor his professors, nor the authors  <br/>
of any of the textbooks he read, has ever met an unschooling family.  <br/>
They simply are completely ignorant of natural learning.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is they think they know because to educators kids without  <br/>
school don&#39;t exist. All teachers know is the behavior of kids in  <br/>
coerced learning environments.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How do<br/>
&gt; Unschoolers feel about the Montessori theory of &#39;sensitive&#39; periods<br/>
&gt; when the developing brain is most able to learn certain things (e.i.<br/>
&gt; languages)?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s something to that, but less than educators might theorize.  <br/>
It&#39;s important to realize they have no way of testing it. What will  <br/>
they do? Have two sets of kids: one who are given reading instruction  <br/>
and a control group where reading instruction is withheld? And do the  <br/>
same with math instruction? But all they&#39;d be testing is the results  <br/>
of presence or lack of instruction. Unschoolers may not instruct, but  <br/>
they fill that gap with life where kids are exploring the concepts by  <br/>
using them in real, natural, personally meaningful ways.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously it&#39;s much easier for kids to absorb language when they&#39;re  <br/>
little. But most adults -- who don&#39;t shut down from fear -- find that  <br/>
immersion is the best way to learn a language. Just like little kids.  <br/>
(An adult has to be open to the learning and actively using it. Just  <br/>
being plunked down in a foreign country without the desire to work at  <br/>
picking up the language won&#39;t work.)<br/>
<br/>
And I think another thing that makes people believe that earlier is  <br/>
better is child prodigies. They start early and master early. It  <br/>
*seems* like the big factor is starting early. But the big factor is  <br/>
that prodigies are *pulling* in what fascinates them. That&#39;s what  <br/>
little kids are doing with language: they pull it in because it&#39;s  <br/>
interesting and they&#39;re finding it useful for their own purposes.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter started taking guitar lessons two years ago after 15  <br/>
years of not showing much musical inclination other than liking to  <br/>
listen to rock. At first she practiced what she was told to do and  <br/>
making slow progress. It was frustrating for her. Then in November  <br/>
she discovered Van Halen and wanted to be like Eddie :-)  At that  <br/>
point she started *pulling*  in everything she could and her progress  <br/>
shot up. (If anyone wants to see what she could do 8 months after  <br/>
finding a passion for 80s rock, you can see her friend&#39;s recital with  <br/>
Kill the King by Megadeth:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMXyxZh4ups">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMXyxZh4ups</a><br/>
<br/>
They only had two practices together. The beginning, she said, is  <br/>
simple, just keeping the beat basically but halfway through she gets  <br/>
to solo and demonstrate what passion does for learning :-)<br/>
<br/>
Force and going through the motions can&#39;t replace the effect of the  <br/>
passion to pull stuff in. And unfortunately we can&#39;t control passion.  <br/>
But we can open all the doors so for them to explore and find passion  <br/>
for themselves and then support their exploration. The Van Halen Vol  <br/>
1 DVD would hardly be classified as educational by any educator but  <br/>
it&#39;s probably more learning-filled than any &quot;educational&quot; item we  <br/>
brought into the house.<br/>
<br/>

NOTHING more interesting than Spongebob AND they fear that it will be <br/>
taken away immediately if they leave, then sure they&#39;ll watch all the <br/>
time. BUT step back and really *see* what they are doing...very few <br/>
kids (who aren&#39;t afraid that it&#39;ll be taken away if they move their <br/>
eyes from the screen) simply &quot;sit&quot;. There&#39;s often talking, thinking, <br/>
sketching, other sorts of play going on (My DS will grab the k&#39;nex or <br/>
legos or his sketchpad or his laptop or his Nintendo DS if he&#39;s not <br/>
connecting with us over some program...and sometimes even if he is). <br/>
Change the focus and apply it to yourself &quot;I love to &lt;garden, read, <br/>
draw, ...&gt; I get really involved when I do it. Sometimes I even <br/>
forget to eat or sleep when I&#39;ve got a new &lt;novel, set of pastels, <br/>
type of plant to care for&gt;. If my spouse forced me to stop after 30 <br/>
minutes at a set time of day, I&#39;d feel &lt;name an emotion&gt; and I&#39;d want <br/>
to &lt;action&gt;&quot; Odds are, whatever that limited thing is, you&#39;d look for <br/>
ways to get more of it and you wouldn&#39;t want to miss a single minute <br/>
of it when it was &#39;permitted&#39;. Take it or leave it but there are lots <br/>
of us who don&#39;t now (and some who never have) limited media access <br/>
(TV, videogames, etc) for our children and our kids are the ones <br/>
leaving the room, turning it off, finding other things to do. It is <br/>
real and it does &quot;work&quot; but not until you put away the fear of &#39;what <br/>
if...&#39; And, yes, some people (not just kids) will choose to watch a <br/>
LOT more TV than others, but then I know people who spend a lot more <br/>
time gardening than I do and I spend a lot more time reading than <br/>
some adults I know. There&#39;s another alternate thought process &quot;If my <br/>
child read books all day, I&#39;d &lt;fill in the blank&gt;&quot; Generally <br/>
speaking, reading for hours at a time is considered a &quot;good&quot; thing <br/>
while watching TV for hours is a &quot;bad&quot; thing. But neither is <br/>
accurate - reading and TV are just tools to get information, <br/>
entertainment, recreation, etc. A co-worker&#39;s MIL is a movie critic - <br/>
she watches 8 to 10 hours of movies per day. My co-worker and her DH <br/>
(son of the movie critic) don&#39;t even have a TV. Which is &quot;better&quot;? <br/>
Neither, they&#39;re just different choices. Thing is, your fear of TV is <br/>
taking away your children&#39;s choices.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Horse hockey (okay that&#39;s not speaking for all unschoolers, just me). <br/>
The &quot;normal&quot; range for reading is roughly 4 to 13 - such a large <br/>
range makes even having a range pretty silly, dontchathink? Anything <br/>
that the brain is &#39;sensitive&#39; to will be learned, lessons not <br/>
required. Our culture is awash in symbolic language (that&#39;d be <br/>
reading) - there&#39;s no way a child in an average American household <br/>
can avoid being exposed to letters and sounds. And, it gets absorbed <br/>
in exactly the amount and timing that they can handle at that time. <br/>
So, what&#39;s the point of specifying &#39;sensitive&#39; periods if you are <br/>
making the whole world accessible freely and facilitating each <br/>
individual child&#39;s interests, regardless of whether it falls in <br/>
a &#39;sensitive&#39; period. With the whole world available, what the <br/>
individual is &#39;sensitive&#39; to will be absorbed whenever and however. <br/>
No need to &quot;invent&quot; lessons or whatever - LIFE is out there.<br/>

That&#39;s a whole other thing. You&#39;re trying to compare apples and <br/>
tangerines here. I&#39;m 100% for folks establishing schools in places <br/>
like Cite Soleil, Port-au-Prince, Haiti - those families have zero <br/>
resources. As you note, we have such an abundance of resources that <br/>
it&#39;s near impossible, for instance, for an American child to NOT be <br/>
exposed to the written word. It&#39;s generally &quot;normal&quot; for Haitian <br/>
children to rarely see the printed word. Huge difference. <br/>

Hi Stephanie,<br/>
<br/>
Self discipline is self invoke. Which is why it&#39;s called SELF <br/>
discipline and not IMPOSED discipline. The reason we have self <br/>
discipline is because we have priority list of things that needs <br/>
doing. In order to accomplished this list of things, we need a <br/>
schedule, which requires us to monitor our time usage. This is <br/>
called A discipline, a set of systems or regulations. <br/>
<br/>
Your priorities is very very different compared to your kid&#39;s. <br/>
Therefore your self discipline pattern will be very difference <br/>
compare to your kid&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
You as a mother and home-person have a very long list of priorities. <br/>
Housework, cooking, responsibilities, yourself and educating your <br/>
kid. Which means you need a very tight and busy self dicipline if <br/>
you need to accomplish much.<br/>
<br/>
Your kid, on the other hand, has very little priorities, for now. He <br/>
only does what&#39;s relevant to a kid - which is to play, watch and <br/>
learn. No responsibilities, no deadlines, no accomplishement. For <br/>
now, his days will be filled with multiple on-going process of <br/>
learning thru watching and playing, which will form his ONLY <br/>
priorities for now.  He doesn&#39;t do housework for it&#39;s not relevant <br/>
to his needs, he doesn&#39;t do responsibilties for he hasn&#39;t got any. <br/>
<br/>
So his self discipline will be very simple and relax for now. For <br/>
what can you expect out of a little mind that&#39;s only been alive for <br/>
6 years on earth? Everything takes time, just like from crawling to <br/>
walking to running. He hasn&#39;t got much target to hit. Everything he <br/>
does now will be open-ended, Never finish, but it&#39;s always a new <br/>
discovery.   <br/>
<br/>
His priorities list will grow longer as he matures, adding onto it <br/>
more and more interest and things to accomplish. Soon, you&#39;ll find <br/>
that he&#39;ll have 20, if not more, things to create, to research, to <br/>
talk about, to read about or to build. Questions to ask, puzzles to <br/>
dicipher. Soon he&#39;ll wants to complete something, a sense of <br/>
accomplishment is needed. This is when he&#39;ll evoke his own SELF <br/>
discipline- his own internal set of system to work with.  <br/>
<br/>
And you have the next 10 years to facilitate his discovery/ <br/>
learning. <br/>
<br/>
So, start facilitating that language learning interest of his, by <br/>
reading to him, as he requested. My child is a very good reader, <br/>
he&#39;s 8 and he still wants us to read to him every night. And yes, I <br/>
believe it is tru reading to him every night for the past 8 years is <br/>
what makes him an excellent reader, which eventually manifest into <br/>
an excellent speller. My child read first, then learn to spell <br/>
later.   <br/>
<br/>
He is also very good at Maths too. Just by casual observation and <br/>
conversation and lots of video/ online games.  We do abit of pc <br/>
lessons which is games based, only when he wants too. <br/>
<br/>
Our days are filled with lots of tv watching, lego, video gaming, <br/>
online gaming, funny experiments (we&#39;re stuck on fire and burning <br/>
stuff and learning lots about chemistry). No structure, no routine, <br/>
no expectations. He eats what he wants, I eat what I want. We are <br/>
really 2 very individual characters at home all the time, until <br/>
hubby comes back, and he makes 3. <br/>
<br/>
Geography starts when daddy&#39;s home because news will be on, and <br/>
documentary shows will most likely follows. <br/>
<br/>
I do have my &quot;am I doing right?&quot; days but that&#39;s expected, for I am <br/>
dealing with a real lively talkative child, not a robot. We&#39;ve been <br/>
unschooling for 20 months now, and already my child&#39;s self directed <br/>
interest/ learning is spread out across Grade 3 - 5. <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>
<br/>
Best Wishes,<br/>
SharonBugs.   <br/>

Nothing wrong with watching spongebob. There is a learning element <br/>
there, even tho we adult cannot see it, doesn&#39;t mean we cannot <br/>
recognise and accpet a learning is taking place. It&#39;s like us <br/>
watching a cooking show, our kids probably wondered why we&#39;re <br/>
watching a show about pots and veg. We are learning something that <br/>
doesn&#39;t seems relevant to them. So, spongebob is not relevant to us, <br/>
which is why we can&#39;t see what&#39;s there to learn. But I do know my <br/>
son did learn of some aquatic animals by watching squarepants LOL!<br/>
<br/>
To what I&#39;ve read about Maria Montessori and her beliefs in <br/>
sensitive periods from birth to 6 yrs old. I think it&#39;s possible to <br/>
align this philosophy along unschooling, afterall it is just about <br/>
mental and brain development. I aligned The Philoshy of Classical <br/>
Education along mine - very similar to this montessori idea, it&#39;s <br/>
just that the CE has a wider and longer age segment and it only have <br/>
3 age segment- google it, and you&#39;ll find lots to read about it.  <br/>
<br/>
We unschoolers talks about naturally learning. We talk about <br/>
allowing the child to pursue thier own interest and learn from it, <br/>
and it&#39;s not necessary Maths or reading. Maths and reading is <br/>
normally a secondary produce, that happened to be involved. A happy <br/>
accident, i would say. I know it sound horrible, kinda like  a hit <br/>
and miss situation. But it is not, because Maths and reading is very <br/>
much part of our daily existance. So, when our kids pursue thier <br/>
interest, they will come in contact with some form of maths and <br/>
reading in a more natural setting. This will help them understanding <br/>
the application and usage of it. You see, it is the understanding <br/>
that creates the learning, and not the memorising. It is when Maths <br/>
is taken out of context and presented in an abstract format, that&#39;s <br/>
when it become confusing and hard. <br/>
<br/>
So, if we&#39;re unschooling, we cannot expect the child to voluntaryly <br/>
want to seek reading and maths activities just because at age 4 - 6 <br/>
they are supposed to be reading and math readiness. But I supposed <br/>
we can facilitate such periods, by strewing books and tv shows with <br/>
this elements around them (i did this) but we cannot expect nor <br/>
force them to pick it up and pay attention to them. But then the tv <br/>
might just do the trick LOL!  <br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t understand your question. Could it be that you&#39;re asking if <br/>
our unschool children will fare better because of parental attention <br/>
and available resouces? <br/>

 My question is, when/ how do unschooled children come<br/>
to understand that sometimes we need to have the self-discipline to do<br/>
things we may not want to do but need to for various reasons?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
*I* don&#39;t do *anything* I don&#39;t want to do. I choose to do some pretty <br/>
yucky things. But those are *my* choices. I could choose not to do them <br/>
and suffer the consequences---OR I can choose other options.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t need &quot;self-discipline&quot; to do those things. It&#39;s just a <br/>
choice---one I make deliberatively.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
My son has no interest in learning how to read(maybe bruised by my<br/>
prodding?) but would have me read to him all day? Does anyone have<br/>
readers that have just learned it this way? I am worried he will never<br/>
learn to read...<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
My younger son is 12. He learned to read by being read to and by being <br/>
exposed to the written word. For 12 years. He learned by having all his <br/>
questions answered.<br/>
<br/>
Why don&#39;t you read to him all day?<br/>

-=-My son is 11 and he isn&#39;t a fluent reader yet.<br/>
I know children who weren&#39;t fluent until they were 13 or older. And  <br/>
yet you<br/>
cannot tell them from earlier readers. Maybe that isn&#39;t comforting.  <br/>
Maybe what<br/>
you want to hear is that unschooling will give you a guaranteed  <br/>
reader by age x.<br/>
There isn&#39;t a guarantee. School doesn&#39;t give you a guaranteed reader  <br/>
by age 18.-=-<br/>
<br/>
This is from a list I&#39;m not on.  A listowner sent me a post because  <br/>
she thought it was good enough for me to put on my site.  She was right.<br/>
<br/>
The author&#39;s on this list, and probably all the things I was itching  <br/>
to write as I read it were written over there, but I&#39;m dying to say  <br/>
this:<br/>
<br/>
School doesn&#39;t guarantee to make readers.  School is known to have  <br/>
produced thousands of NON-readers.  School has had some kids who did  <br/>
learn to read pretty well, and then grew to hate books.<br/>
<br/>
I know of zero unschoolers who totally failed to learn to read by the  <br/>
time they were grown, and none who hate the sight, touch and smell of  <br/>
books.<br/>
<br/>
I said &quot;thousands&quot; above.  It&#39;s very likely millions.<br/>
<br/>
One of my unschooling mentors had a boy who was &quot;behind&quot;-- <br/>
developmentally delayed in verbal ways (not physical).  He&#39;s a marine  <br/>
now, and no one who met him would EVER think &quot;this kid was slow&quot; or  <br/>
&quot;this guy doesn&#39;t read.&quot;  No way.  He&#39;s very verbal and literate, but  <br/>
he wasn&#39;t verbal early.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s a couple of years older than Kirby.  When he was ten or so and  <br/>
not reading, his mom said the coolest thing one day.  She said she <br/>
figured if he could read a menu by the time he was old enough to go  <br/>
on dates, that would be fine with her.  By the time he was old enough  <br/>
to go on dates, he was reading novels.  But here&#39;s something his mom  <br/>
wrote in 2001, when he was still a kid at home, and not a full-grown  <br/>
U.S. Marine:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1094059017">My daughter just turned seven.  We&#39;ve never done any formal &quot;training to read&quot; type of thing.  When she was younger she loved to go to the library.  This was great because I love books.  I love libraries.  I get a real rush walking into a library.  Bookstores make me swoon.  I loved going to the library with her and seeing what books she would pick.<br/>
<br/>
For the past year so, Megan hasn&#39;t liked libraries.  She doesn&#39;t like books.  She has one or two that she loves (Knufflebunny comes to mind), but she isn&#39;t interested in exploring her world via books. She likes that I can look up information on the internet.  She loves youtube and video games (Zoo Tycoon and similar).  She explores her interest in animals by watching Animal Planet and other shows I find for her.  She also does tons of pretend play (pretending she&#39;s a vet and pretending she&#39;s an animal and I&#39;m the vet).<br/>
<br/>
Today she asked me if all turtles like to swim.  I told her I wasn&#39;t sure and we could look it up online or we could go to the library.  She said she saw the library line coming from a mile away and she wasn&#39;t going to the library.  :-)  She also didn&#39;t want to go online.  She was happy to talk about why turtles might like to swim and if we could think of a type of turtle that didn&#39;t.  We didn&#39;t get very far.  Her animal interests are largely big cats...so the turtle thing was new for us.<br/>
<br/>
Can she read?  When she wants to read, she does.  We were at the zoo a few weeks ago and she read an entire informational plaque by herself for herself.  If I had said &quot;read this, prove to me you can read&quot; she wouldn&#39;t have done it.  If she had said &quot;read this for me&quot; I would have.  Lately she has been experimenting with spelling.  On her own.  If I tried to &quot;force&quot; the issue, she&#39;d stop.  So I&#39;m going along for the ride and it is way more interesting to let her lead.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>(e.i.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; languages)?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As a former Montessorian, I&#39;d say that its one of the most <br/>
misunderstood aspects of the theory. The big, important part <br/>
of &quot;sensitive periods&quot; is that the goal of the adult is to be <br/>
observant - to watch for times of sensitivity and then feed them. In <br/>
unschooling terms we say it this way: support your kids&#39; passions. <br/>
<br/>
For a 2yo that may mean a passion for running in circles and <br/>
knocking things over - in montessori terms that&#39;s a sensitive period <br/>
in terms of gross motor coordination and learning about the basic <br/>
physics of motion and states of matter. It doesn&#39;t mean trying to <br/>
explain to that child the need to slow down or clean up, it means <br/>
finding space to run and building endless towers to destroy.<br/>
<br/>
My 14yo has gone through some &quot;sensitive periods&quot; recently - he&#39;s <br/>
exploded into writing and programming. Our challenge has been to <br/>
provide ways for him to do that where he can feel comfortable and <br/>
supported. Its not a time to correct his grammer and ask &quot;but what&#39;s <br/>
it *for*?&quot; Its time to feed the passions themselves. <br/>
<br/>
Its always okay to offer - do you know about &quot;strewing&quot;? here&#39;s a <br/>
link: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/strewing">http://sandradodd.com/strewing</a><br/>
<br/>
The important point to consider is that the goal of strewing is to <br/>
provide options and choices, not to find a way to sneak lessons on <br/>
magnets and paper-folding into kid&#39;s lives.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>they<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; are sensitive to certain concepts and if the structure is not there<br/>
&gt; from the start they will forever have learning difficulties. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The irony is, schools are the worst places for creating exactly <br/>
those kinds of learning difficulties. A free child, free to explore <br/>
and develop along his or her own exact timetable, will create his or <br/>
her own unique system of &quot;scaffolding&quot;. Its inherent in how humans <br/>
learn. We build our own set of connections - are building them all <br/>
the time. We don&#39;t need to Give children someone else&#39;s scaffold - <br/>
if anything that disrupts the learning process and interfere&#39;s with <br/>
the child&#39;s own scaffolding.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Where I begin to get nervous with unschooling is when I read of<br/>
&gt; parents allowing their kids to watch TV all day.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I suspect you&#39;ve never hung out with any unschooled kids who have <br/>
unlimited tv. It doesn&#39;t look the way you are afraid it will look. <br/>
Yes, some kids watch a lot more tv than others, but kids who are <br/>
used to free tv also do much much more conncurrently with watching. <br/>
They play and build and write and draw and paint and pretend. If <br/>
your kids&#39; tv has been limited, they haven&#39;t had a chance to learn <br/>
these skills, yet. They&#39;re still &quot;hoarding&quot; and &quot;binging&quot; when <br/>
they &quot;get&quot; to watch tv, rather than using tv as one of the many <br/>
tools in their environment. <br/>
<br/>
If I see my kids spending a Lot of time in front of the tv I ask <br/>
myself one question: what do they need? Sometimes we get in a rut <br/>
around here, especially with only one vehicle. So the kids need some <br/>
fun, some excitement in their lives. Something that&#39;s more <br/>
interesting than the tv. Changing seasons is a common time for that <br/>
to happen in my house. <br/>
<br/>
But sometimes what the kids need is actually being met by the tv. <br/>
Really. Tv can be a wonderful source of information presented in a <br/>
visual format - very empowering for kids who don&#39;t read yet, or who <br/>
are more visual learners. Tv can also be a way for kids to explore <br/>
aspects of the world that aren&#39;t readily available to them - <br/>
currently my 7yo wants to go to Africa and China. That&#39;s not an <br/>
option for my family, but she can look at books and magazine and <br/>
watch shows and movies that help her learn more about those parts of <br/>
the world. <br/>
<br/>
My 14yo is busy exploring Big Ideas - concepts of space and time and <br/>
morality and justice and his place in the universe. He doesn&#39;t find <br/>
books very accessible, so he uses the tv and the internet to find <br/>
out what other people have thought about similar Big Ideas. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How do unschooled children differ from say, developing nations who<br/>
&gt; have no opportunity/ resources for school? Are those children<br/>
&gt; unschooled too or is it our communities resources and our parental<br/>
&gt; attention that makes the difference?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There *are* places in the world where school is a better option than <br/>
home - some of those places are families (in developed nations, too) <br/>
where there is abuse or other misery in the home. Some of those <br/>
places are areas where there are few resources in the home to help <br/>
people learn to live and work in our technological world. When kids <br/>
can get what they need to thrive at home, outside education is <br/>
unneccesary. That&#39;s one of the fundaments of unschooling - we can <br/>
provide more and better than the schools, in more areas of life. <br/>

i put her on starfall.com , and played leapfrog videos, and got her worksheets , and worked on blending 3 letter words....and..... <br/>
She put up with me for about 2 long months. <br/>
Then wanted nothing to do with reading and insisted I just read it to her.. So I did . <br/>
Eventually she got interested in pretty journals and we bought several because she liked them . She would draw pictures and sometimes want me to write something and i did. She started playing games on game cube and the computer and Id read to her when asked and sometimes she would just figure it out. <br/>
<br/>
Journals went to fewer pictures and more written words ( done by Courtney) and World of Warcraft became an intrest .<br/>
<br/>
All of a sudden ( more like slowly over time but it seemed like all of a sudden ) she was reading chapter books to her little sister and brother. <br/>
<br/>
Anyhow all that to say yes read to him whenever he asks not to try to help him learn to read but to make his world happy and sparkly. <br/>

Jared (15) started reading at the age of 12, without any hang ups<br/>
about &quot;early&quot; or &quot;late&quot; reading. He&#39;s a wonderful advocate for<br/>

YOu can&#39;t tell him apart from a child that learned to read at the age<br/>

&gt; certain ages, therefore it is important that children be taught to for<br/>
&gt; instance &quot;skip count&quot;or multiplying before a certain age. At that point<br/>
&gt; I investigated- this is the best link I found:<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Brain research provides important neuroscientific evidence to support<br/>
&gt; the broad aim of lifelong<br/>
&gt; learning: Far from supporting ageist notions that education is the<br/>
&gt; province only of the young<br/>
&gt; � the powerful learning capacity of young people notwithstanding �<br/>
&gt; neuroscience confirms<br/>
&gt; that learning is a lifelong activity and that the more it continues the<br/>
&gt; more effective it is.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1553392867">I&#39;ve never posted before but my daughter&#39;s experience really speaks  <br/>
to this question.  I&#39;ve always read to her as much as she wanted,  <br/>
often until my lips were numb.  We also listen to many, many recorded  <br/>
books, often repeatedly.  She appeared to be ready to read at 4.  At  <br/>
6 I started bugging her with worksheets and reading programs, until  <br/>
she wouldn&#39;t look at them anymore and I finally stopped.  It drove me  <br/>
crazy!  She started reading more at 9, and really became fluent at  <br/>
10.  Just this summer, at 11, it really caught fire for her.  Her  <br/>
current goal is to finish  &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and read the &quot;Lord of the  <br/>
Rings&quot;  series in the next few months (she already knows the stories  <br/>
well).   She also decided to go to school this year (6th grade).   <br/>
Just last night she was expressing surprise at the vocabulary that  <br/>
the other kids don&#39;t know.  She has a very sophisticated grasp of  <br/>
language, literature, history, many things mostly from being read  <br/>
to.  (She didn&#39;t do well on an assessment of reading aloud, so she&#39;s  <br/>
practicing;  I can&#39;t fathom why they assess for that!).<br/>
<br/>
I just had some work to take care of on the computer, so my 7 year  <br/>
old went and found a stack of Berenstain Bear books and is busy  <br/>
reading them while I write.  He also listens to recorded books, and I  <br/>
just finished reading him &quot;The Wee Free Men&quot; by Terry Pratchit--a  <br/>
&quot;young adult&quot; novel (hilarious, by the way).<br/>
<br/>
Keep reading to your kids, and have faith!<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t remember if this has been brought up or not, but its really <br/>
normal for any kind of learning to happen in &quot;waves&quot; - learn a <br/>
little and put it aside for awhile. I&#39;ve see both my kids do that in <br/>
soooooo many different ways. It can kind of &quot;fake you out&quot; if you <br/>
aren&#39;t aware that this is really one of the natural ways people <br/>
learn things. *Sometimes* people get all fired up and learn things <br/>
all at once in a blinding flash, but very often its more like <br/>
watching the tide come in, wave by wave.<br/>
<br/>
My 7yo reads sometimes, when she wants to. Mostly she&#39;s interested <br/>
in reading as a tool, not for fun, and she *hates* reading aloud and <br/>
rarely enjoys being read to. One of the interesting things about her <br/>
reading is that she doesn&#39;t remember the names of most of the <br/>
letters - she knew them once upon a time, but since that information <br/>
has little to do with reading, she&#39;s forgotten it. It comes up when <br/>
she wants to know how to spell something and says &quot;what does that <br/>
letter look like, again?&quot; <br/>
