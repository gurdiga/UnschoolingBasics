<div id="ygrps-yiv-1636430041">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
I am very excited to find your group! My wife, six year old daughter <br/>
(born December 2000), and I are running an unschooling sustainable <br/>
living community in south India. We are looking for like-minded <br/>
people to join us (on a short term or long-term basis). <br/>
<br/>
We moved here in 2003 and designed an eco-friendly way of life <br/>
including alternative construction, solar energy, water resource <br/>
management, and composting toilets so that we could raise our <br/>
daughter in a true unschooling environment. <br/>
<br/>
We call the project Sadhana Forest and the main objective is to <br/>
create a natural learning environment while reforesting 70 acres of <br/>
severely damaged land in Tamil Nadu, India. We are re-creating the <br/>
indigenous forest of our area, the Tropical Dry Evergreen Forest. <br/>
This forest type is found only in South India and Sri Lanka and <br/>
provides a rare biological richness due to its very high species <br/>
abundance but it is now close to extinction as only 0.01% survives. <br/>
This is a last moment effort to keep this very rich and beautiful <br/>
Forest on earth. <br/>
<br/>
In exchange for volunteering, we provide free facilities such as <br/>
accommodation, a small swimming pool, a small collection of books, <br/>
daily yoga class, and the use of several bicycles. Examples of <br/>
community work include: Tree planting, indigenous plant nursery, <br/>
contour bunding, organic gardening, fence building and installing, <br/>
compost and soil management with Effective Microorganisms (EM). <br/>
<br/>
Please contact me if your family is interested in joining us for a <br/>
vacation or for a longer-term stay, and feel free to share this with <br/>
others.<br/>
