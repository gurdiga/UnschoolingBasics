<div id="ygrps-yiv-656432845">Dear Melissa,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for sharing your feelings and thoughts. I feel deeply, too, and<br/>
have gone through much pain. You have such a wonderful perspective and have<br/>
made great progress in becoming who you want to be in life and to your<br/>
children. I wish I could hold so steadfastly to my goal for my future self.<br/>
<br/>
You are my inspiration.<br/>
<br/>
All the best,<br/>
 <br/>
Deborah :-)<br/>
