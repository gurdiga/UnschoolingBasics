<div id="ygrps-yiv-1137961554">Okay, now Beth is really gonna think I am stalking her. (just take it as the<br/>
vote of confidence that it is..&lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I am Mary Alice, full time mother-baby nurse by night, wife to Mike the HVAC<br/>
business owner and mother to 2 boys by day (and night)!<br/>
<br/>
The older of the two is 11 and was in ps until halfway through 4th<br/>
grade-pulled him out in November of &#39;04 because I didn&#39;t see the rewards<br/>
inherent in breaking his spirit in order to help him fit into a classroom.<br/>
The year before had been the one good year of school he had-it was really<br/>
uplifting-and I thought we were on an upswing. We had always known about<br/>
hsing, but I was in school full time and acknowledged that ps was an<br/>
affordable option to facilitate that-free daycare and only that. As he got<br/>
older I think I lost sight of that mentality and started to buy into the<br/>
idea that schooling was a precious resource and stopped questioning their<br/>
sacred cow. Plus, I graduated and started working full time. And then we had<br/>
a great year in which E blossomed and bloomed into a self-confident,<br/>
responsible young man! He loved his teacher, he enjoyed school. The next<br/>
year we were back to the taming of the child to fit into the classroom. We&#39;d<br/>
had enough. It was actually DH&#39;s idea to bring him home! I wasn&#39;t sure I<br/>
could handle the pressure! But much like the time he brought our newborn<br/>
nursling to our bed and said, &quot;Why don&#39;t you just let him sleep with us?&quot; to<br/>
my great surprise, I didn&#39;t balk and ran with it!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I had dreamed of never ever sending my little one to school. But then I<br/>
needed somebody to take care of him while I was sleeping for my night shift,<br/>
and last year he stayed in the day care we loved for pre-k because he just<br/>
adored his teachers and his classmates and was really grooving on the<br/>
structure of it all. No problem there. He knew he&#39;d have more fun there than<br/>
he would at home while I slept! I almost sent him to Kindergarten this past<br/>
autumn and just couldn&#39;t bring myself to do that to him! At least not just<br/>
because I was afraid I couldn&#39;t teach him how to read! (How unlike me,<br/>
really! I can do anything!)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
DH works all day and owns his own business (with partners thank goodness)<br/>
and he&#39;s the one who calms me down and says things like, &quot;We can&#39;t stop them<br/>
from learning. When does school end and life begin? It doesn&#39;t!&quot; I have<br/>
strewn his path with AP and other ideas and although in the normal course of<br/>
events I think he never would have encountered these ideas, he has run with<br/>
them-like discussing homebirth (not that we&#39;ve done it) or breastfeeding<br/>
with his construction buddies when one of them announces an impending baby!<br/>
He has intuitively accepted that children are people and love learning and<br/>
thank goodness I have him to convert theory to practice for me. I panic in<br/>
the moment. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We have mostly unschooled the whole time, or less-schooled. I brought Elijah<br/>
home with the sole intention (and I need to remember this!) that if he gains<br/>
nothing else he will maintain his mental health. I think I lost what little<br/>
I might have had (raised by an absent recovering alcoholic and a manic<br/>
depressive genius) by having to fit into a classroom. Nobody cared if I<br/>
learned anything-and they all knew intuitively that I grasped everything<br/>
presented-and yet it was like they *had* to get something over on me, they<br/>
*had* to gain the upper hand on one thing. I see that now. I totally did not<br/>
see it then. All I saw was that I was the exception to the rule, every rule<br/>
and was therefore useless in society, or at least homeless. But I digress.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I value academia and organized instruction, I do. I value seeking knowledge<br/>
from those who have it and having them share it with me.  For this reason I<br/>
am a bit torn because I recognize today that there was plenty of knowledge<br/>
that I would not have sought to learn when I needed it, but that I had<br/>
acquired as a child. I am grateful for my grasp of grammar and usage, but I<br/>
am not sure, if I had never encountered it I would have taken the time later<br/>
to learn it. However, had *my* mother unschooled me, I would have learned it<br/>
anyway because she would have continued to correct my grammar ant that of<br/>
any radio announcers or written media she encountered! So I need to learn to<br/>
trust that my children are steeped in my values simply by living with me and<br/>
are likely to therefore value what I value. I never read much as a child<br/>
beyond picture books but everyone I loved did. When my attention span and<br/>
lifestyle allowed it, I became the avid reader I had always dreamed of<br/>
becoming. I think osmosis and immersion really does work a lot more<br/>
profoundly than forced application. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
But.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My biggest problem is not feeling like the underachiever I always have been<br/>
when people ask me in awe, &quot;How do you do it?&quot; Because all I ever want to<br/>
say is, &quot;I don&#39;t do it, they do!&quot; People ask me, &quot;when do you sleep-when do<br/>
you teach?&quot; I skirt the questions with, &quot;They have things they can do while<br/>
I am sleeping.&quot; Now that I write this, I see the parallel I need to draw.<br/>
When I nursed them both for 3+ years each, I avoided many a conflict simply<br/>
by not volunteering information that was not public knowledge.  Granted, it<br/>
was a safety issue for me, as I didn&#39;t want to have to defend my parenting<br/>
practices every time I turned around. But it also made sure that by not<br/>
offering up my lifestyle choices to public scrutiny, I was not asking for<br/>
approval. I need to do that now, with this lifestyle choice. I need to<br/>
settle into it and trust it like I did the attachment of babyhood and<br/>
toddlerhood. Sending my kids away really interrupted the natural progression<br/>
of immersion that was our life together. At least now I have it back! I am<br/>
only just realizing this since I started embracing unschooling-embracing my<br/>
boys as they are.   <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, yes, now I do feel like I&#39;m being stalked!!  How many yahoo <br/>
groups is this now??  Oh go on and say it Mary Alice, repeat after <br/>
me:  I AM AN UNSCHOOLER and my children are wonderful!  :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I value academia and organized instruction, I do.<br/>

mean your children will or should value it as well.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You can&#39;t know that because you weren&#39;t in that position.  Stop and <br/>
think about this a moment... when your boys have wanted to know <br/>
something, have they truly given up before finding out because it <br/>
seems schoolish to learn something?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My biggest problem is not feeling like the underachiever I always<br/>
&gt; have been when <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mary Alice, look at what you wrote!  &quot;I always have been&quot;  ??  <br/>
First, you&#39;re probably being too hard on yourself.  Second, you&#39;re <br/>
comparing yourself to others within a schoolish mentality.  Third, <br/>
you&#39;re passing your baggage onto your children.  You probably feel <br/>
the way you do because of the way you were raised and all of your <br/>
experiences.  Right?  Your boys are not being raised under the same <br/>
set of circumstances!  They are wonderful!  And I can say that <br/>
because I actually have met them.  *laugh*<br/>
<br/>
You are an unschooler wanna-be.  You&#39;ve got what it takes but you <br/>
are just hanging onto those last few threads of traditional crap <br/>
that you just can&#39;t seem to let go of.  The funny thing is that your <br/>
DH and boys are definitely *there*, you just have trouble defining <br/>
yourself that way!  :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve got to get together with you soon.  I&#39;d love to let you borrow <br/>
my Parenting a Free Child book by Rue Kream, IF you promise to give <br/>
it back!!!  *grin*<br/>

sought to learn with what an unschooled kid might seek to learn.<br/>
<br/>
It just doesn&#39;t work the same way for these kids - they are different.<br/>
<br/>
You say you value seeking knowledge from those who have it and having  <br/>
them share it with you -- that is a way of life for unschoolers,  <br/>
every person around them is seen as a resource for learning something  <br/>
interesting and potentially valuable.<br/>
<br/>
When kids are little, their focus is on physical skills - sitting up,  <br/>
walking, etc. Then they turn more to communication and relationships  <br/>
- talking and empathy. Then there is an age range in which kids tend  <br/>
to be &quot;fact-gatherers&quot; - usually around ages 8 to 11 or so. They  <br/>
often LOVE information, at that age, and tend to be very concrete,  <br/>
not interested so much in analyzing stuff, but more interested in  <br/>
gaining knowledge. Then they get into more abstract thinking - great  <br/>
big ideas and also how everything fits together.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooled kids don&#39;t ever really exit these stages - when they hit  <br/>
the more abstract thinking stage, they just add that new ability/ <br/>
interest to the concrete information-gathering they were already  <br/>
doing, for example.<br/>
<br/>
I think they tend to be more integrated in some way - it is hard for  <br/>
me to explain what I mean, but I&#39;ve seen it over and over. The 18  <br/>
year old unschooler still has the enthusiasm and energy for trying  <br/>
things that she/he had at 1 year old when learning to walk and at 5  <br/>
or 6 when learning to ride a bike. He/she still has the awareness of  <br/>
becoming more and more empathetic and communicating more clearly - a  <br/>
process that started as a toddler. AND he/she still loves information  <br/>
- looks at the whole world as a sort of natural museum, like those  <br/>
fact-gathering 10 year olds, and has added to all that an ability to  <br/>
put it all into perspective, to analyze, to choose consciously, to  <br/>
think critically.<br/>
