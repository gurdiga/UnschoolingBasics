<div id="ygrps-yiv-926677131">There was a really interesting BBC show maybe 2 years ago, Planet Earth (I <br/>
think). The show was formatted to work for U.S. television, so an hour long<br/>
show was 40 minutes on the BBC which doesn&#39;t have commercials (except for <br/>
itself--like PBS). To fill the 20 minutes difference they used the DVD<br/>
material called The Planet Earth Diaries, where David Attenborough would <br/>
talk about aspects of the filming or the editing. One episode was largely<br/>
about Snow Leopards and they had a whole story about mother and son, very <br/>
long, very emotive. In the Diaries section they said that they used the<br/>
first footage they got in the last section of the show. So, the artistic <br/>
desires of the show beat out the desire to tell the truth, or at least to<br/>
present the footage in a linear, true to time, fashion. I kinda thought it <br/>
was cool though. I&#39;d never really thought about it. I&#39;ve seen other shows<br/>
talk about the fact that they will use captive animals to video those shots <br/>
that they couldn&#39;t get the light for in the wild.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that is what the original poster was referring to.<br/>
<br/>
I do think that they are often much better about not having grossly <br/>
inaccurate descriptions of animal behavior. We watched a show about<br/>
Edentates (sloths, anteaters, and armadillos) the other night that had Tom <br/>
Baker doing the narration (the scarf wearing Doctor Who, for the anglophile<br/>
amongst you, he does the voice overs for Little Britain as well). He was <br/>
very tongue in cheek. I imagine some of the information was sullied by the<br/>
desire to be funny. Not an awful trade-off, really.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-416224653">Thanks Schuyler!  I just might have to look that one up.  I was born<br/>
in Liverpool, so we do seek out BBC productions when I&#39;m feeling<br/>
particularly sentimental and homesick;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1698733541">Hi Emilie,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the condensed explanation.  I did see your links to books<br/>
on the topic, but my reading list is already a mile long;)  It was the<br/>
&quot;political motivation&quot; part that threw me.  While the patriarchy and<br/>
politics are (unfortunately) inextricably linked, I didn&#39;t make the<br/>
connection first time around.  I may have to dust off my Marilyn<br/>
French this evening;)  I&#39;m intrigued by her thesis.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Kirsten<br/>
