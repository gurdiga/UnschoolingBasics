<div id="ygrps-yiv-371184051">&quot;The discussion between Ren and Sandra Dodd made me realize<br/>
that I NEED to attend the conference. I will definitely be ordering a <br/>
few of the CD&#39;s from the 2005 conference!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m SO glad it inspired you to make plans for attending. The <br/>
conference is truly a life changing experience for so many of us.<br/>
The handbook talk you gave the link for, is more about the healing <br/>
benefits of unschooling, while the CD talk is actually about mindful <br/>
parenting....just to avoid confusion if anyone else visits that link.:)<br/>
<br/>
Kelly would love to have you all buy CD&#39;s!! You can also get an MP3 of <br/>
all the talks for only $75, and it will play on your computer (it&#39;s a <br/>
CD disc in MP3 format, won&#39;t play on a CD player, but computers work <br/>
fine).<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and there is a conference email list for any of you that want to <br/>
stay informed:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LiveandLearnConference/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LiveandLearnConference/</a><br/>
<br/>
The website will be updated soon, I&#39;ve been told: <br/>
LiveandLearnConference.org.<br/>
<br/>
And it will take place in NM, not AZ! Minor difference for those of us <br/>
traveling from TN.:)<br/>

<br/>
I just want to go to AZ, so I thought I would just move the conference their with me!  LOL!  Thank you for the correction because I would have been working on going to AZ.  What part of NM will the conference be in?  Thank you for the link.  I will join the group to stay abreast of conference news.<br/>
<br/>
Peace and Thanks!<br/>

What a wonderful way to put it! In actuality, I think that&#39;s what drew me to homeschooling, <br/>
was I could feel that all of our closeness was disappearing, the stress over school was so high <br/>
that it was hard to cope with dealing with emotions, trying to address the kids needs as well <br/>
as mine while dealing with school. All I wanted to was to pull back out of society for a while, <br/>
reattach to my family, and feel the love again! the homeschooling wasn&#39;t working well, again, <br/>
too much stress in trying to do everything I thought should be done. I suddenly became <br/>
aware that not only my kids needed to decompress, I needed to as well! and that&#39;s what I&#39;m <br/>
working on...the negativity, the whole &quot;why not?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
thanks for posting the link, I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do without the support and knowledge base <br/>
here, muddle through somehow, but feeling lonely and unsure.<br/>

 <br/>
In reference to the other thread about husbands not getting on board with  <br/>
the program, I was thinking that perhaps this is one of the reasons our  <br/>
reluctant partners can get stuck on aspects of unschooling/mindful  parenting.  They <br/>
are either not willing or not able to get around that  painful childhood <br/>
memory.<br/>
 <br/>
In Unconditional Parenting, Alfie Kohn discusses that we often parent  as our <br/>
parents did because to be &quot;better&quot; would be disrespectful.  I don&#39;t  remember <br/>
if he says this, but I also think we have that inner child that NEEDS  his <br/>
parents to be perfect.  So by parenting &quot;better&quot; we expose a part of  ourselves <br/>
that is a lie.  Very painful.  I need to unearth that book  and get an exact <br/>
quote.<br/>
 <br/>
Oh, and excellent job, Ren (and Sandra).  Forgot to say that  before.<br/>

feels so good to him to be able to say Yes, let&#39;s get that, do that, <br/>
try that, explore this, etc to DS when his growing up was all <br/>
about &quot;do extra chores/get good grades/wait for your birthday or <br/>
holidays to earn this or get that&quot;, &quot;no you can&#39;t do that it&#39;s <br/>
silly&quot;, &quot;That&#39;s a waste of time/money&quot; etc. He&#39;s even admitted to <br/>
feeling a little jealous at times of the freedom DS has to grow and <br/>
Be. Which is when I try to remember to encourage him to let that <br/>
part of himself Be free and do things too. He&#39;s getting to do now <br/>
all those things he wished he could do then - and having a great <br/>
time!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Interesting point. I want desperately to get around the memories, I&#39;ve buried them too long <br/>
(my mother was horribly abusive, and neglectful). My husband on the other hand, honestly <br/>
sees nothing wrong with his childhood, regardless of the fact that his sister has shared some <br/>
of it with me. We&#39;re both the oldest child enablers of manipulative, obsessive-compulsive, <br/>
and domineering women, and mild-mannered, intellectual fathers who probably saved our id <br/>
and ego.<br/>
