<div id="ygrps-yiv-1464929005">Get-togethers are tough sometimes. It was hard to listen to the itinerary of <br/>
fabulous events my sister-in-law is planning  this summer(we are of a very <br/>
limited income) and then in the same afternoon hear the proud telling of how <br/>
she wants to force her son to take certain classes he isn&#39;t even interested in. <br/>
The re-enactment of how she got in his face to emphasize a point to him about <br/>
obeying his teachers, was the worst. My brother and sister-in-law are very proud <br/>
of their traditional parenting and are supported in this by the rest of the <br/>
family; it makes for a lonely afternoon, we have learned to keep our mouths <br/>
shut. <br/>
<br/>
The thing is we barely recognize them anymore. Who are these 2 people we love <br/>
who we thought we knew? I guess it&#39;s us who have changed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-46674211">Or everybody changed. People change when they have children. And money issues can put up another barrier. Just because you are related that doesn&#39;t mean you have to enjoy each others&#39; company or even try. Maybe in a few years when everyone grows up and see that most of the kids turned out OK and you can all relax.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-438686010">&quot;Family isn&#39;t about what blood you have.  It&#39;s about who you love.&quot;  -- From<br/>
South Park<br/>
<br/>
I think it may be helpful to mention that just because someone says<br/>
something to you, or asks you a question, you are not bound to respond.<br/>
It&#39;s a curiosity to me that people feel compelled to answer or respond to<br/>
remarks all the time. Maybe it is an acculturation issue, I don&#39;t know, but<br/>
it&#39;s clear we are uncomfortable with silence.<br/>
<br/>
Consider the following:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You should take time for yourself!&quot; -- when offered by a mother to her<br/>
daughter (grown with kids)<br/>
&quot;Why do you have 4 dogs?!&quot;  -- offered by a father to a grown child<br/>
&quot;Your son needs to go to school.  Our son gets all A&#39;s in school.&quot;  --<br/>
offered by a SIL<br/>
<br/>
*******************************<br/>
<br/>
In each case, you can easily hear a defensive statement offered.  Trying to<br/>
justify your life, your choices etc...try to educate, inform, enlighten.<br/>
Many of us have been there and done that.  Over and over.  The fact is that<br/>
it almost never works.  There is a subtle, (sometimes less than subtle)<br/>
attempt to bully the listener into acting, thinking, or doing that which the<br/>
speaker is addressing.  Because of this, there isn&#39;t really any amount of<br/>
&quot;education&quot; that will work to bring an end to the inquisition.  You only<br/>
waste your breath and in many cases appear to weaken your position by<br/>
offering explanations and placating gestures.<br/>
<br/>
Try saying nothing.  Just stare at the person.  You don&#39;t have to be unkind<br/>
about it.  But just be clear you are paying attention.  If they question you<br/>
more, be attentive more.  Most Americans are very uncomfortable with<br/>
silence.  And it helps to bring about startling change if used consistently.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing to think about is WHY are they asking?  WHY do they pressure<br/>
you?  Is it out of love for the child or is it something less noble?  After<br/>
all, if you espouse the virtues of an unschooling life as being as good as<br/>
or better than conventional parenting/compulsory schooling then are you not<br/>
saying by default that those who DO what you have rejected are not parenting<br/>
in the loving way you are?  You may be doing this or you may not have had<br/>
the thought, but it&#39;s all about perception...if your SIL perceives you are<br/>
saying &quot;I love my children more than you love your children as evidenced<br/>
by...&quot; she will be angry and defensive.  She may call CPS or she may throw<br/>
her energy into &quot;converting&quot; you back to doing what she does so she doesn&#39;t<br/>
have to change her worldview.<br/>
<br/>
Another reason people ask things or say things, especially like the<br/>
statement above from the mother about &quot;time&quot;...it&#39;s because (or may be) she<br/>
had wished she had time to herself, or she may have been a mother who did<br/>
take time, and so like the SIL, even if she&#39;s not coming out and saying it,<br/>
may be pressuring you to fit the paradigm she used because anything else<br/>
will shine a light on those things she may have done &quot;wrong&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
So instead of trying to defend yourself, or explain yourself...just &quot;be&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
In the first example, a very simple, &quot;Thanks Mom, I&#39;ll consider what you<br/>
said.&quot;  Notice there is no weight given the suggestion.  But there is<br/>
acknowledgement of her offer of &quot;helpful advice&quot; and that should end<br/>
things.  If she presses in future, &quot;Well are you?!&quot;  &quot;I am considering what<br/>
you said.  Thanks Mom.&quot;  Can be very effective.<br/>
<br/>
In #2 Just silence.<br/>
<br/>
In #3 I would also use silence.  (However, I tolerate NO interference from<br/>
my siblings or their mates in my life.  So were I pressed I&#39;d tell the SIL<br/>
to drop it in no uncertain terms.  But that&#39;s me.  Might not work for you.)<br/>
<br/>
All of this to say, I guess, that it&#39;s sometimes helpful to remember that<br/>
just because someone fills the silence with noise...doesn&#39;t mean you have to<br/>
respond in any way.  You don&#39;t HAVE TO do anything.  Even if they are<br/>
family.  Too many people are bullied by their family system process and it<br/>
just doesn&#39;t have to be that way.  You have changed one thing about your<br/>
life, (the way you parent your children) why not create change in other<br/>
relationships?  If you attempt to make change happen and it&#39;s not working<br/>
out, there isn&#39;t anything wrong with putting distance between yourself and<br/>
that system.<br/>
<br/>
You only get one shot at this life -- don&#39;t let it be filled with toxic<br/>
stuff just because it&#39;s coming from &quot;family&quot;.<br/>
