<div id="ygrps-yiv-1226198042">We went unschool about 3 weeks ago with everything that <br/>
wasn&#39;t &quot;homeschool&quot;.  My daughters are 4 & 7.  They used to <br/>
imagination play for hours on end, but now since there is unlimited <br/>
computer and tv time that&#39;s all they want to do.  <br/>
<br/>
Some times I offer things to do - like going to the park, playing <br/>
outside or riding bikes, read a book to them (my 7 year old does <br/>
read by herself), play board/card games.  Sometimes they accept, but <br/>
more often they do not.  Many times they will do things with me <br/>
while they wait for their turn on the computer (we only have one so <br/>
we take an hour at a time as a turn).<br/>
<br/>
My only problem with TV and computer all the time is that we are <br/>
homebound more often then we used to be.  We used to go to story <br/>
time at the library, play at the park and just be out more.  My <br/>
oldest has even blown off karate class for a whole week (something <br/>
she loves) in order to stay home and watch TV.  <br/>
<br/>
Is there a detox period for this?  When does the gorge wear itself <br/>
out? Are there signs to look for?<br/>
<br/>
Another thing is that my oldest daughter is experiencing some kind <br/>
of boredom phase.  She&#39;s frustrated or something and hasn&#39;t learned <br/>
how to get over being bored by herself?  Is this something she has <br/>
to learn on her own?  Is there a way to guide her through this <br/>
time?  I&#39;m totally new to this and would appreciate any feedback and <br/>
lots of criticism.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-222992612">Hello Cara,<br/>
<br/>
we are unschooling for 2 weeks now :-) The first thing my daughter  <br/>
(7) did, was play computer ALL DAY. Also, since there were no  <br/>
bedtimes, she went to sleep at 2, 3, even if we were in bed already.<br/>
<br/>
Since 2 days, the computer is kind of &quot;out&quot;. She hasn&#39;t touched it!  <br/>
Now it&#39;s the TV. So yes, tehre is definetely a detox period, I think  <br/>
they call it &quot;deschooling&quot; here :-) It may take longer for your kids  <br/>
until they find out that there is more to life than TV and PC.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how it is, but maybe you are showing them that you don&#39;t  <br/>
like this behaviour. They might fear that the limits come back. So  <br/>
they feel they have to hurry up and do as much as they can now!<br/>
<br/>
Another problem is probably that there is only one computer. I know  <br/>
it&#39;s not very cheap to buy another one but if this is causing them to  <br/>
still feel they are limited in their freedom it might be worth it.  <br/>
There are cheap, used ones and if you cannot afford it now you can  <br/>
work out a plan on how to finance it (save up...) I&#39;m not from the  <br/>
US, but some here have been talking about some cheap thingy/place/???  <br/>
where they wait (?) for a cheap computer, maybe you can ask.<br/>
<br/>
And finally, you are clearly seeing &quot;imagination play&quot; and going to  <br/>
the party, playing outside and so on as more valuable than watching  <br/>
TV and playing on the computer. I can recommend Joyce Fetteroll&#39;s  <br/>
website: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://home.earthlink.net/%7Efetteroll/rejoycing/">http://home.earthlink.net/%7Efetteroll/rejoycing/</a> Check out  <br/>
the parts on &quot;Television&quot; and &quot;Videogames&quot; and you might change your  <br/>
view :-)<br/>
<br/>
I think you have to let them take their time deschooling and of  <br/>
course continue doing strewing! <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/strewing">http://sandradodd.com/strewing</a><br/>

 </span></blockquote>Did you announce that there were now no limitations or did you just slowly<br/>
let them realize that you weren&#39;t limiting them?  And you *are* limiting<br/>
them when you set up hour blocks that they can be on the computer.  They are<br/>
trying to get in as much as they can because they only get an hour at a time<br/>
*and* there is that fear that the limitations will come back.  You&#39;ve only<br/>
been unschooling for 3 weeks.  They&#39;ve lived a life with at least some<br/>
restrictions, limitations and boundaries for 4 and 7 years.  Yes; a &quot;detox&quot;<br/>
period is definitely going to have to happen.  Join them when they are<br/>
watching TV and on the computer.  Find out what they are doing that is SO<br/>
interesting to them right now.  Start strewing some things.  Phrase things<br/>
in statements rather than questions.  For instance instead of saying, &quot; Do<br/>
you wanto to go to the park?&quot;  say &quot;I&#39;m feeling cooped up and need some air,<br/>
let&#39;s all go to the park and kick the soccer ball around for a while.&quot;  or<br/>
&quot;Hey, it&#39;s story time at the library.  We haven&#39;t been in a while and I miss<br/>
it.  Let&#39;s go and afterwards we can look at the computer software that the<br/>
library offers for checkout.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I never made a big announcement to the kids that they were free from all the<br/>
controls.  I simply started saying yes more and no less.  Eventually the<br/>
kids caught on that I wasn&#39;t as &quot;mean&quot; as I was before and not long after<br/>
that they glommed onto the word &quot;unschooling&quot; (which my oldest decided to<br/>
google to find out more about :) )  Your kids are still pretty young but<br/>
they are new to these freedoms.  They have to build your trust that you<br/>
aren&#39;t going to take away those freedoms again.  3 weeks isn&#39;t a very long<br/>
time to build that trust.  You may have given them more freedoms in the past<br/>
and then tightened the reins again fairly quickly.  They maybe in a holding<br/>
pattern waiting to see when &quot;summer vacation&quot; is going to end this time.<br/>
<br/>
Our role as unschooling parents isn&#39;t to sit on the sidelines and watch.<br/>
Our role is to be active and mindful of their needs and to help enrich their<br/>
lives through participation.  And have you &quot;detoxed&quot; yourself as well?  Have<br/>
you lessened the restirictions that you have placed on yourself like<br/>
*having* to do certain chores?  Have you changed the way in which you think<br/>
about the things you do in the house?  An exercise that I did about a year<br/>
ago (thanks to a post by Kelly about making choices) was to tell myself in<br/>
my head &quot;I choose to pick up these dishes in the living room&quot; when I would<br/>
find them (yet again) strewn in the living room (or maybe my kids were<br/>
strewing for me what they felt I liked doing :-D ) I would say to myself &quot;I<br/>
choose to do this load of laundry&quot; or &quot;I choose to sit at my hobby desk and<br/>
make a few cards&quot; or &quot;I choose to do the recycling today&quot; or &quot;I choose to<br/>
clean the cat box.&quot;  I let go of the &quot;have to&#39;s&quot; and embraced the &quot;choose<br/>
to&#39;s&quot;  Try it!<br/>

<br/>
Thank you so much!  The phrases will really help. The ideas are all <br/>
floating around in my head - I&#39;m just having a hard time &quot;detoxing&quot; - <br/>
incorporating the phrases and releasing control.  It&#39;s like learning <br/>
to speak and act all over again. <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t realize that by setting the hour block I was still limiting <br/>
them - I was trying to be &quot;fair&quot;. I guess I need to trust and respect <br/>
them to be fair with each other instead of me being bossy.  I just <br/>
realized that my oldest is doing the exact same thing I did when I was <br/>
a kid and my parents controlled my time.  <br/>
<br/>
This morning, my oldest asked when I was done typing if she could be <br/>
on next.  So I said ok.  When I was finished I told her and she jumped <br/>
on.  Her sister then wanted to play so she asked and my oldest just <br/>
turned it over without a fight.  Then my oldest wanted to play and my <br/>
youngest picked a game they could play together.  Then my youngest <br/>
came to cuddle with me on the couch, and my oldest played by herself <br/>
and we watched a movie together.  NO FIGHTING, NO ARGUING.  That in <br/>
itself was heaven. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you!</div>
