<div id="ygrps-yiv-355108218">I&#39;ve seen it written here and on other lists and unschooling sites that a side benefit of unschooling can be the healing that comes from parenting the way you would like to have been parented.  <br/>
<br/>
My daughter is 9 and my son will be 7 next week. <br/>
<br/>
Every now and then, I have a moment where I find out I can be there for my kids in a way I never knew was possible.  Sometimes, along with the satisfaction of seeing the tangible results of unschooling in my childrens&#39; lives, it brings up a lot of grief for me personally, realizing what I did not have as a child. It surprises me, because I thought I had processed that stuff long ago, but apparently these things can come in waves.<br/>
<br/>
It can be motivating, but also distracting. I&#39;d like to hear if others have experienced this and what has helped move through the grief and return more to the present moment.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-626719728">That often happens when a child is withdrawn from school too: the pain and grief can be overwhelming for the parent---sometimes moreso than for the child. The parent needs to &quot;get it out&quot; and can keep me on the phone for hours. &lt;g&gt; It may take weeks or months or years to get over the trauma, but slowly the parent can heal and start seeing the *benefits* of home/unschooling instead of the anger at school.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s part of the healing process.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Work it out yourself. It may take time, and that&#39;s OK---as long as it doesn&#39;t interfere with your time with your children. The other side is greener. ;-)<br/>

We all come with baggage. I just want to give my child a simple carry-on, not a whole set of Samsonite.<br/>

<br/>
I stopped forcing my son to eat at cetain times & certain things.  In<br/>
doing so, a memory came up for me.<br/>
<br/>
I was about 9 years old, broke, and ate beans & rice every night.  I was<br/>
so tired of eating beans & rice and told my Mom so.  She told me to get<br/>
over it, eat it, or go to bed hungry.  So, I went to my room, stomach<br/>
rambling and became so, so angry.  I started throwing my records on the<br/>
floor, breaking them.  Anything to get her attention and more<br/>
importantly, understanding.<br/>
<br/>
I allowed myself the moments to breathe that memory in and out.  I tell<br/>
myself that today I have a choice.  Today, as Mom in this scenario, I<br/>
would have taken me aside and listened to my complaints about the food<br/>
and deeper issues that the food manifested.  I would ask if anything in<br/>
the kitchen we could find to make that would give me something different<br/>
to eat.  I would ask about item I could purchase that would give me a<br/>
feeling of being satisfied with my nourishment.<br/>
<br/>
AHH..felt better already.  And so, giving my son these loving<br/>
experiences IS giving them to myself.  Recreating what was done for me<br/>
forces the experience on me AGAIN and creating it anew on another human<br/>
being.<br/>
