<br/>
ATC&#39;s are Art Trading Cards. They are little works of art 2.5&quot;x3.5&quot;, <br/>
with the artist&#39;s information on back. They can not be sold, only <br/>
traded with other ATC folks.:)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s some detailed info:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cedarseed.com/air/atc.html">http://www.cedarseed.com/air/atc.html</a><br/>
<br/>
And if you decide to join Imagination Tribe, we have photos of our <br/>
recent ATC trade as well as the art/craft projects of the various <br/>
members that choose to post photos.<br/>
<br/>
There are many of us that have found such a support group very <br/>
helpful for overcoming fears of inadequacy in regards to art/writing <br/>
etc.... It IS a support group rather than a discussion group. It <br/>
exists to help people nourish their creative selves, so it&#39;s a very <br/>
positive place.<br/>

    I haven&#39;t spent much time reading about the ATC since the Live and Learn<br/>
Conference in St. Louis.  But my boys did trade at the conference and are<br/>
still interested in trading cards with other kids.<br/>
    Is there an easy way to do this?<br/>
   We hope there will be a trade at the next conference!<br/>
    I actually made some cards to trade but never considering myself to be<br/>
artistic (other than in the hairstylist field)  I couldn&#39;t bring myself to<br/>
trade them in St. Louis. So they are sitting here in my dresser.   Old<br/>
school humiliation haunting me, I guess.<br/>
   Maybe I&#39;ll bring enough courage with me this year.<br/>

And maybe the list will inspire you to let go of your old school<br/>
hurts....that&#39;s really why I created it in the first place. Healing<br/>
can be assisted when you have support, and realize that most of us are<br/>
dealing with (or have dealt with) many of the same fears.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to post an excerpt here from the Imagination Circle Journal<br/>
that the group created last year. My friend Amy in Pensacola wrote<br/>
this on one of her pages:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I almost passed this journal along without contributing.  Something<br/>
about this makes me feel naked.  Like the dream I had in school where<br/>
I go onto the bus having forgottten my clothes.<br/>
I think this feeling of insecurity and impotence---I know I have<br/>
something to say but lack the courage or ability to say it---that<br/>
feeling comes from my days in a classroom.  Then, independent thought<br/>
wasn&#39;t ok.  Well to hell with that!  It&#39;s time to reclaim my voice.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What does this have to do with unschooling? Everything!!<br/>
I think our ability to move confidently in the direction of our dreams<br/>
(as Thoreau once said)  and interests, hugely influences how effective<br/>
we are in assisting our children in creating the live of their<br/>
choosing.  It&#39;s time to heal!! It&#39;s time to pull out the crayons and<br/>
paint and PLAY...just because it feels good. No more judging yourself<br/>
as inferior, no more comparisons. <br/>

I&#39;ll trade with you! You definitely won&#39;t be intimidated by my ATC&#39;s. :o) But they&#39;re soooo much fun!<br/>

has always made it seem like &quot;less&quot; than art somehow...not by saying <br/>
anything, he&#39;s too kind to do that, but I guess by what was not said.  <br/>
(He is an amazing artist, painting, drawing, ect)  However, this past <br/>
year I stood up to him and told him how he has been making me feel, <br/>
and now am enjoying my art so much more.  ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1920808832">Aw man, my messages are coming all out of order and I<br/>
can&#39;t find the beginning of this thread! Can I ask<br/>
what brought ATCs into the conversation? I am an<br/>
artist and do a lot of ATCs. From what I can find of<br/>
this thread I&#39;m assuming that there are other ATC<br/>
artists here? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2070164115">Jessica,  there are several ATC artists here and if you want to trade<br/>
with us (and folks not at this list) then just come on over to the<br/>
Imagination Tribe list. <br/>
Right now, we&#39;re really focused on getting this quilt project done.<br/>
But we&#39;re also in the midst of an ABC book and just finished an ATC<br/>
trade. Another ATC trade is pending.<br/>
