<div id="ygrps-yiv-896746132">Reina,<br/>
<br/>
Your post made me think... what stresses are there in unschooling?  I know<br/>
for me it&#39;s completely stress free until someone butts there nose in and has<br/>
issues with it.<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering from all of you and from Reina, what stresses have you found<br/>
in unschooling?  Are there really any or is it just our &quot;schooled&quot;<br/>
perspective of it?<br/>
<br/>

- Reina, I&#39;m not picking on you... it&#39;s just that I hadn&#39;t thought of this<br/>
issue with unschooling before.-<br/>

I&#39;m thinking of this option in case I get too stressed out with unschooling<br/>
or if ds says he wants to go to school.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I with you Lesa, most stresses come from outside sources, folks who <br/>
have no clue but think they are entitled to chime in (fortunately, <br/>
NOT family, so we can simply brush off the questions and move on).<br/>
<br/>
One stressor for some, possibly, is income. Some are living on one <br/>
income; some are juggling shifts/part time jobs; some are working <br/>
from home or running their own businesses. All of these can have <br/>
their own stresses - not unique to unschooling but definitely <br/>
represented in the unschooling population.<br/>
<br/>
Another stressor possibly is dealing, fulltime, with medical and/or <br/>
behavioral issues (where having the child in school would provide a <br/>
few hours away). In those situations, sometimes creating a way to <br/>
get &quot;time off&quot; - respite care, a babysitter, a bubble bath <br/>
(depending on the situation) - can help out some in those situations.<br/>

Not too long ago I started becoming concerned that my son&#39;s hair was too long. It&#39;s ridiculous for me to be concerned about such a thing living here in Hippie Town, U.S.A.

 </span></blockquote>found<br/>

<br/>
Actually, I find it stressful just thinking about unschooling... my son is<br/>
only 18 mo old. I know that I personally don&#39;t handle stress well, so I try<br/>
to think up all of the scenarios for when he comes of school age and we have<br/>
to &quot;come out&quot; and tell everyone we&#39;re homeschooling/unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I will find a lot of resistance to unschooling since I come from a family<br/>
who highly appreciates academic achievement, including me at this point. So<br/>
my stress is not only from what I expect to have around me, but also from<br/>
me! In earlier posts I had talked about self-doubt, and I don&#39;t think that<br/>
this is something that can dissapear overnight! And I suppose I also have to<br/>
deschool myself and my dh before we can truly launch into unschooling<br/>
wholeheartedly. On the other hand here I am in this forum! - so I&#39;m taking<br/>
little steps, and I see the goal but I just need to clear the path.<br/>
<br/>
Income might also become more of an issue. I would love to hear from more<br/>
people where both parents work and can still unschool their child. We don&#39;t<br/>
have family near us, so our options are limited.<br/>
<br/>
The democratic school option was something I had thought about before<br/>
knowing about unschooling. It seemed like a great alternative (if we can<br/>
afford it). <br/>
<br/>
So yes, in my case it is the &quot;schooled&quot; perpective of it which stresses me<br/>
out.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to &quot;come out&quot; and tell everyone we&#39;re homeschooling/unschooling.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s a tip - something we did even though we didn&#39;t anticipate any <br/>
major problems: don&#39;t tell them &#39;unschooling&#39;. Start now saying you <br/>
plan to homeschool. Period. No big details. General &quot;we&#39;ve got lots <br/>
of time...we&#39;re exploring...we&#39;re looking into a lot of options...&quot; <br/>
because that&#39;s all *true*. And just keep living your lives and <br/>
watching your wonderful DS grow. By the time he&#39;s &quot;school age&quot;, it <br/>
will seem pretty normal to just live life (you&#39;ll already have <br/>
gotten through the &#39;no preschool&#39; questions by then). After a year <br/>
or so of living life together with a &#39;school aged&#39; kid, who I pretty <br/>
sure your whole family will love and cherish and think is a great <br/>
kid, you can start substituting &quot;unschooling&quot; in discussions <br/>
of &quot;homeschooling&quot;. Don&#39;t hit it really hard. More like, answer <br/>
questions but don&#39;t offer a lot of additional information (kind of <br/>
the same as dealing with any legal requirements, stick to the law <br/>
and don&#39;t offer anything more). The proof of the pudding is in the <br/>
eating...in this case, they&#39;ll already see your wonderful DS in <br/>
action and growing and thriving. Also, be proactive in <br/>
providing &quot;what we&#39;re doing&quot; tidbits...we went to the zoo, we built <br/>
a spaceship with Legos here are some pix of DS with his creation, <br/>
the local hs group had a beach day and here&#39;s DS and some other kids <br/>
looking for seashells...yadda yadda. So, on the one hand, provide <br/>
lots of &quot;our days&quot; info that shows you&#39;re not hiding in a dark <br/>
closet somewhere but on the other hand, don&#39;t be doing a lot of <br/>
educational philosophy debates. Odds are they don&#39;t *personally* <br/>
know what homeschooling looks like inside (just odd stories here and <br/>
there) so whatever you define as &#39;homeschooling&#39; is what you&#39;ve got <br/>
to work with. I know it really helped not to get into it much, <br/>
except for answering basic questions basically (is it legal? yes) <br/>
and answering lots of questions with questions (&quot;kids have to go to <br/>
school to learn to read!&quot; &quot;Why? I was reading before I started <br/>
school, and so was...and...and...&quot; &quot;Oh yeah I guess you&#39;re right&quot; - <br/>
excerpt of actual conversation with elderly aunt some years <br/>
ago...now she&#39;s our biggest supporter).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-367635421">Reina, you asked about both parents working.  I work overnight hours and my<br/>
DH has his own painting business.  My DD is almost 10 so I&#39;m able to work<br/>
overnight and have her be awake and responsible enough for herself while I<br/>
sleep.  There are times where she&#39;ll go to work with my DH if necessary. <br/>
She is also more on a later sleep schedule now, too, because of unschooling<br/>
and having no bedtime.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the thing... I haven&#39;t mentioned unschooling to any people who would<br/>
criticize the method.  I have &quot;had it out&quot; with my mom because at one point<br/>
she was grilling my DD every time she would visit about what she did that<br/>
day with school and &quot;test&quot; her math skills.  I did do a bit of &quot;school&quot;<br/>
after that conversation but quickly went back to unschooling.  I know better<br/>
than to mention the word or the philosophy... I feel bad because when people<br/>
do ask what we do or what we&#39;re using I do sort-of lie to them.  I&#39;ll<br/>
mention we use the library a lot (which isn&#39;t a lie) but I&#39;ll mention the<br/>
math curriculum that we were using and if they ask how long she takes<br/>
everyday I&#39;ll give them the time she was doing it in or what I think they<br/>
want to hear.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I do everything to avoid the situation of other people&#39;s involvement<br/>
or comments.  I&#39;m really just concerned that someone will contact the<br/>
authorities, even though I don&#39;t have to keep records in IL.  That&#39;s just<br/>
not something I want to deal with, so I keep my mouth shut about what we do,<br/>
even around most other homeschoolers.   <br/>
<br/>
Lesa<br/>
<br/>
-we are still in the deschooling process, so to most people it would look<br/>
like we&#39;re not &quot;doing anything&quot;.  though my DD watches a ton of HGTV and<br/>
Animal Planet and is learning plenty there.  she is still learning to be<br/>
free in who she is and once she feels comfortable with that I&#39;m sure her<br/>
interests will expand and grow.-<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Then maybe don&#39;t think about it so hard just yet. Your son doesn&#39;t need a mom stressed out about something that&#39;s still years away. Enjoy him now! Keep unschooling in the back of your brain as one of your options. Don&#39;t fear it, just research it. I&#39;m pretty confident that as your little guy gets older, you&#39;ll continue to see the benefits of having him learn in a free, nonschooled  environment. And by then you&#39;ll have read so much that you&#39;ll be fully prepared to have that conversation with those schooled voices in your head. :o)<br/>

Thanks Deb,<br/>
This is really what I&#39;m hoping will happen. Just last night I had a dinner<br/>
invite with some relatives. They all have children some of them grown-up,<br/>
some of them still very young. All were commenting how interested my ds is<br/>
in his surroundings/people and how well we communicate with him even though<br/>
he&#39;s only 18 mo. I was a little surprised since my (AP)friends&#39; babies who<br/>
are about the same age are developing at about the same rate. The difference<br/>
is with my relatives they have raised their children by the &quot;children should<br/>
be seen and not heard&quot; philosophy, and not respecting their children as<br/>
individuals. <br/>

Keep unschooling in the back of your brain as one of your options. Don&#39;t<br/>
fear it, just research it. I&#39;m pretty confident that as your little guy gets<br/>
older, you&#39;ll continue to see the benefits of having him learn in a free,<br/>
nonschooled  environment. And by then you&#39;ll have read so much that you&#39;ll<br/>
be fully prepared to have that conversation with those schooled voices in<br/>
your head.<br/>

You&#39;re absolutely right about this. I do enjoy everyday that I&#39;m with my<br/>
son. I&#39;m hoping that in a couple of years I will have all the confidence<br/>
that you all have. It just that right now my mind is so filled with the<br/>
thought of unschooling that I&#39;m constantly thinking about it and reading as<br/>
much as I can and talking as much as I can about it. I&#39;m pretty obsessed<br/>
right now. I need some more time on this till I can let go and &quot;keep it in<br/>
the back of my mind&quot;. <br/>
Come to think about it, isn&#39;t this the way a typical curious child would<br/>
want to find out about something? More reason to leave my son alone to<br/>
pursue his interests rather than send him to school and be bombarded with<br/>
things he&#39;s not interested in learning at that moment! I know it was hard<br/>
for me to &quot;turn off&quot; my curiosity during school hours and &quot;turn it back on&quot;<br/>
after school. <br/>
<br/>
I need to get into that book list that someone suggested. I have about 5<br/>
books in the library waiting to be picked up... I&#39;ll get to it soon I hope.<br/>
It&#39;s hard reading with an active 18 mo old!<br/>
