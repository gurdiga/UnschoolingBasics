<div id="ygrps-yiv-754037636">Thank you so much to everyone who wrote with advice on room cleaning with my <br/>
daughter.  I put all the responses in a word document and printed them out <br/>
to give to my husband.  He has questions about unschooling and many of you <br/>
wrote such beautiful things I just had to share with him.  I have been <br/>
working on her room for 2 days now and it&#39;s going fine.  I just set a timer <br/>
for 15 minutes and keep telling myself that I am spending time with my <br/>
daughter, not trying to teach her anything.  It&#39;s been very nice.  Yesterday <br/>
she sat up in her bunk bed and gave me a news broadcast from stuffed amimal <br/>
land and today she made up a song to sing and a dance to go with it to show <br/>
her appreciation.  She has thanked me about 100 times and it&#39;s only been 2 <br/>
days.  She is so genuinely grateful it brings tears to my eyes.  I&#39;m not <br/>
sure how to put it...she is thankful without the adult baggage...she is <br/>
thankful in a way that shows that she does not expect me to clean up after <br/>
her like a servant...ugghh, not easy to put into words.  I am also glad <br/>
someone wrote in asking about learning responsibility....that was also one <br/>
of my concerns.  I printed out all those responses as well.  I am planning <br/>
on giving Natalie a big huge room cleaning, but I think that will have to <br/>
wait for a day when she is out doing something fun with Daddy, I&#39;m still <br/>
working to keep my cool for 15 minutes (grin). Thanks again for all the <br/>
advice.<br/>
