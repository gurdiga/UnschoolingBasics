<div id="ygrps-yiv-48715994">Hi,<br/>
   <br/>
  How to strew to the next level when one works?   The children have their interests.  Japan, Anime, Manga, War games, Forensics, Egypt, Canine Cops, Sharks and Art.<br/>
   <br/>
   I&#39;m thankful my son has Kelly Lovejoy&#39;s son as an outlet, but my girls do not have anyone but each other.  We live in the boonies, activities during the day are out.  I have an autistic daughter whom I&#39;m thinking of entering into Special Olympics.  She loves to run, thankfully practice would be in the evenings.<br/>
   <br/>
  I took my children to an art gallery showing today.  Can&#39;t tell you how much they enjoyed that!!!  Thanks to Kelly Lovejoy&#39;s recommendation!!  It really was a hit.  Hannah came away wanting to attend my Art College at fifteen.  Not sure that is possible....<br/>
   <br/>
  So is that strewing?  How can I make more connections with less time than most of you have with your children??<br/>
   <br/>
  Could you give me an example of connections?<br/>
   <br/>
  TIA<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-215447314">MY husband works full time and doesn&#39;t have as much time with the <br/>
kids as I do. One of the things he does is go out with them without <br/>
the other two. Sometimes it&#39;s just to do some errands, other times <br/>
it&#39;s someplace like miniature golf or the water park. He and my <br/>
daughter have a date planned to see X3 when it comes out. <br/>
He also tries to find common interests. Like with my son, they both <br/>
love auto racing and we have a local track so they go there <br/>
sometimes just to hang out and spend time together.<br/>
He also takes them to any evening and weekend activites that they <br/>
have so he has time to talk to them on the ride there and back. <br/>
The other thing that has helped them connect is our trampoline! Oh <br/>
my god....he is such a big kid on that thing!! LOL!! He gets on with <br/>
my little one and just bounces her around like a jumping bean! <br/>
Actually, that&#39;s how her last baby tooth came out. LOL...<br/>
