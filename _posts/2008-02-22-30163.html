<div id="ygrps-yiv-1931932259">Imagine a place where you can experience an unschooling community<br/>
first hand. Where you can ask questions and get ideas from experienced<br/>
unschoolers. Where no one will ask what curriculum you use and you<br/>
will be surrounded by free families where kids are respected.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re thrilled to offer this joyful, life-affirming gathering of<br/>
unschooling families. Whether your family has been unschooling for<br/>
years, or is just getting started, the LIFE is Good Conference will<br/>
give you the opportunity to connect with other unschoolers who are<br/>
Learning In Freedom Everyday.<br/>
<br/>
The 2008 conference will be held over Memorial Day weekend at the Red<br/>
Lion Hotel in Vancouver, WA. The Red Lion Hotel is located on the<br/>
scenic riverfront overlooking the beautiful Columbia River. Just<br/>
minutes away from the offerings of Portland, Oregon, the hotel offers<br/>
free shuttle service from Portland International Airport and easy<br/>
access to the Oregon Zoo, OMSI and historic Fort Vancouver. <br/>
<br/>
Go to www.lifeisgoodconference.com to register NOW and take advantage<br/>
of the pre-registration discounts.<br/>
<br/>
We hope you&#39;ll decide to join us! This is a wonderful opportunity for<br/>
recharging your unschooling batteries, reconnecting with old friends,<br/>
meeting virtual friends, and being inspired as well as inspiring others!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1748554541">We&#39;re seriously contemplating attending this conference this year. <br/>
We&#39;ve just started down the unschooling path (since mid-December) and<br/>
although some days we seem to be really on target, other days look<br/>
*so* much like mainstream, coercive life around here.  :sigh: <br/>
Although I think that being at the conference with oodles of joyful<br/>
unschoolers would be amazingly uplifting, inspriting, and fun....I<br/>
also worry about showing the &quot;old self&quot; part of me (that may very well<br/>
pop out despite my best efforts!).  I guess what I&#39;m saying is that,<br/>
as a newbie unschooler who is still having less-than-stellar days, I&#39;m<br/>
feeling a bit intimidated.  I&#39;m guessing that not *everyone* who<br/>
attends has achieved a 100% unschooling path, and so I won&#39;t be alone<br/>
in showing my struggling side on occaision.  Anyone want to offer me a<br/>
smidge of reassurance? :)<br/>
<br/>
Be Happy,<br/>

<br/>
I can tell you that, at past conferences, there&#39;s a bit of the <br/>
mainstream, coercion apparent the first day in many new families. But <br/>
as the weekend goes on, parents are relaxing a LOT.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, sometimes *too* much---often to the point of some <br/>
&quot;non-parenting&quot; going on.<br/>
<br/>
There are folks at *all* points along the journey. Observe the <br/>
parenting. Observe the children. You&#39;ll be inspired by many.<br/>
<br/>
Remember that under dire circumstances (lack of sleep, different water, <br/>
unusual eating schedules, and just too much of a good thing!), we can <br/>
all fall back on &quot;old parenting tools.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Remember that we&#39;re all there to help. We *want* you to succeed, and we <br/>
want your children happy. If you need help---or advice---just ask!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1209143031">~~We&#39;ve just started down the unschooling path (since mid-December) and<br/>

<br/>
Gosh, this made me tear up this morning.  I am experiencing *moments* of peace and joy with my girls, but that&#39;s what they are - *moments*.  I want it to be like that all the time, and yet it really appears like it&#39;s me that&#39;s getting in the way.  I&#39;m very frustrated with myself!!!  I am reverting back so often to coercion, trying to get them out the door, trying to get them to go to bed, not all the time, not with everything, but it&#39;s like I can be all flowy for a certain length of time and then, whoa, here&#39;s the mommy back who yells and demands and can&#39;t seem to handle yet another kitchen mess, and just isn&#39;t very nice to be around.  I am reading and talking and emailing and reading and talking and emailing some more.  I have met a fantastic group of unschooling mamas and their kids and we get together every week and email lots in between.  I am writing in my journal.  I am doing *so* many things and yet it doesn&#39;t seem to be enough.  Every night I am determined to do it<br/>
 differently tomorrow, and yet every night I go to bed with so much guilt and grief about how that part of me that is so unattractive showed up again.  My god, I feel like a drug addict that just can&#39;t stop!  I lasted about 12 minutes this morning after they got up before I was getting upset with them about something.  Clearly this is my own shit, and yet I have done *so* much work on this shit!!!  I&#39;m really not sure what else to do here.  Has anyone had this much challenge getting their own shit out of the way??  Can anyone shed any light on this???  Can anyone offer any other suggestions that I may not have tried yet???<br/>

I can&#39;t speak with the elegance of the ladies on this group, but I can SO relate even if it&#39;s my MIL driving me over the clift and not my kids.  My friends have been reminding me to ~breathe~ and give yourself a break.  Look towards what you did that was positive and go from there.<br/>
