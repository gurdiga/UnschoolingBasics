<div id="ygrps-yiv-779393801">The current New Yorker (8-3 issue) has a wonderful and very positive<br/>
short piece in The Talk of the Town about four homeschooled siblings who<br/>
appeared recently in a musical production of &quot;Snoopy&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
From the children&#39;s descriptions, they seem clearly to be unschooling.<br/>
The girl who played Snoopy said he represented the best of the<br/>
homeschooled person: &quot;He teaches himself everything, and he has so many<br/>
sides, and he has time to do all the things he wants to do, and he&#39;s not<br/>
ashamed of it.&quot; The one child who tried school for a year said he left<br/>
because &quot;I found myself being mean.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This should encourage a lot of parents who are considering unschooling.<br/>
The whole piece is here:<br/>

pretty obvious that the New Yorker writer was impressed!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1624594056">I just read this piece and really liked it too! I&#39;m saving my issue to pass the article to my parents (who are pretty on board) and my husband&#39;s family (not so much) as well. <br/>
My aunt told me that Will and Jada Smith unschool their kids...is that true?? not terribly important, just curious!<br/>
