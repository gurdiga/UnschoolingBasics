<div id="ygrps-yiv-83368576">Hi folks!<br/>
It&#39;s been an eventful few weeks, and I wanted to share a bit.<br/>
 <br/>
Last weekend we had an unschooling &quot;commencement&quot; concert and party for  <br/>
Julian, who is 17. In some ways it&#39;s hard to talk about such a thing as an  <br/>
unschooler (we don&#39;t WANT him to be &quot;done!&quot;), but there&#39;s also a lot of value in  <br/>
ritual and celebration. Julian is a musician planning to be a professional  <br/>
musician, so we chose to have him perform a concert for family and friends,  <br/>
followed by a party.<br/>
 <br/>
It was so amazing. He had a bunch of his best friends attend or participate  <br/>
in the performance, and he did a great job. We had about 85 people, I think,  <br/>
with great music followed by partying. It was really nice. And his retired  <br/>
schoolteacher grandmother actually behaved!!!!!!!  The concert ended with a  <br/>
participatory version of Pink Floyd&#39;s &quot;The Wall&quot; --- &quot;We don&#39;t need no  <br/>
education!&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
We had a passel of teenagers here for a nice long visit, and it was loud  and <br/>
giggly and fun. <br/>
 <br/>
This weekend we went to Vermont to visit Goddard College, which Julian will  <br/>
attend in the fall. I am a graduate of Hampshire College, another progressive, <br/>
 alt-y place, but I think Goddard may be the most wonderful choice for <br/>
dedicated  unschoolers. In the individualized BA program, each learner develops <br/>
their own  plan during an 8 day per semester residency, then goes back into the <br/>
community  to learn. The campus itself is lovely, in rural Vermont. And they <br/>
really respect  unschoolers. (Goddard actually sent a rep to the last unschooling <br/>
conference in  Peabody, MA)<br/>
 <br/>
Very cool couple of weeks.<br/>
 <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have my MFA in writing from Goddard. I also have an undergraduate  <br/>
degree from a Big 10 school, a graduate degree from Rutgers, and I&#39;ve  <br/>
attended (and taught at) other colleges,, but Goddard was far and  <br/>
away the best institutional education I ever received. The process of  <br/>
thinking about what I wanted to do, setting my own goals, doing my  <br/>
own evaluations--all with support from a skilled advisor--was  <br/>
amazing. Hard for me, after 18+ years of &quot;do enough to get an A&quot; type  <br/>
education. I kept asking my advisor, &quot;Am I doing enough? Is my thesis  <br/>
long enough?&quot; and he would say, &quot;Do you think it&#39;s long enough?&quot; and  <br/>
I would tear my hair out. I love that school with a passion, and have  <br/>
wonderful memories of the residencies and of being in Vermont in the  <br/>
falls and winters--just beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
Also, at graduation, everybody gets to make a short commencement  <br/>
speech, because &quot;everybody is the valedictorian of their own class.&quot;  <br/>
It&#39;s fabulous.<br/>
<br/>
I was recently wishing Goddard would offer &quot;alumni refreshment  <br/>
semesters.&quot; I have never found as strong and skilled a writing  <br/>
community in the outside world, and I miss it. I could use something  <br/>
like that as I&#39;m working on getting my writing moving again after a  <br/>
very long dry spell.<br/>
<br/>
Goddard is now offering programs for high-school age homeschoolers,  <br/>
as well, I understand.<br/>
