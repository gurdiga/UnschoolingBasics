<div id="ygrps-yiv-136020385">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m after some ideas to help me relax and I guess deschool myself a bit<br/>
more...<br/>
<br/>
On the surface, I think we probably look pretty unschooly, and on the rare<br/>
day, I&#39;ll wake up in a good mood and really enjoy working with what my<br/>
children need and going with the flow.  But mostly I can&#39;t shift the idea<br/>
that things need to Get Done, I feel itchy if I can&#39;t see an end result for<br/>
the day, or feel like I&#39;ve achieved something tangible.<br/>
<br/>
How can I lower my expectations of what gets done (my kids are only 2 anDSd<br/>
nearly 4), but still feel fulfilled?<br/>
<br/>
Today we got up, had fun looking at some crazy fish pictures on the<br/>
internet, my tractor-mad ds got to see a big lorry at the building site next<br/>
door, and a tractor cutting the grass (took some time just watching those<br/>
with him).  Later dh and I planned to tidy the garden a bit, but got waylaid<br/>
by helping a baby bird which we found on the step.  Interspersed of course<br/>
with lots of play,  books, 2 baths for dd, tv etc.<br/>
<br/>
If I read this in the bog of someone I know, or admire and imagine to be<br/>
really cool and in the groove of uschooling, I&#39;d think, wow what a great<br/>
day.  But I just think of all the things I didn&#39;t get done!  I know this is<br/>
typical me and very much like my mum, and the way we organised our schooled<br/>
lives.  But I&#39;d love to change a bit and be more chilled out, live in the<br/>
moment more I suppose.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-388570814">Back when I taught yoga I used to say that if living in the moment wasn&#39;t a challenge, I&#39;d be out of a job ;) That&#39;s not much in the way of advice, but in a way, you&#39;re asking about something that&#39;s bigger than unschooling. How Does one live in the moment? <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do you make lists? Lists can help. Put all the little details that you do without thinking on a list, like: shut all the cabinet doors, and: refresh snack plates. Add another check-mark each time you do them. Maybe that will help you see all the little things you do as things getting done. I read some study, once upon a time, that found checking things off a list creates a sense of satisfaction. (shrug) So make a list that you Know you&#39;ll get to check things off. <br/>
<br/>
Alternately, do you journal or blog? You mentioned you read others&#39; blogs, so what about writing something at the end of the day? Or in the morning, write about the day before. Help yourself see what you&#39;ve done. <br/>
<br/>
Keeping a journal or blog is also a good way to observe your own self-talk. When you start to write ranty things, or put yourself down, you can go back and edit that. Change it until it sounds more like those blogs you admire (not in a &quot;fake&quot; way, in a change-your-perspective way). <br/>
<br/>
Ray&#39;s nearly 17, and is out and about a whole lot nowadays. Enjoy your days of not getting much done. I **guarantee** you won&#39;t look back on these years and think &quot;I wish I&#39;d washed more dishes&quot;. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1916030581">Hi Caroline<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Maybe it helps to know that some - many - of us are only happy within when we know that we<br/>
have done something worthwhile during the time we are awake. I belong to those and<br/>
watching others just veg out when so much &#39;needs&#39; to be done drives me up the wall. Until<br/>
I take a deep breath and understand that there are also people who need to take breaks.<br/>
<br/>
There are also people who constantly feel under pressure to do to be free and others who<br/>
sometimes can do and at other times everything is an uphill battle and they then beat up<br/>
on themselves for what is often called procrastination. It really is not personal when one<br/>
understands that it is how certain energies are defined or not with different people.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
A big part of finding peace within is finding where what we think/feel we should do<br/>
belongs into the &#39;demands from outside&#39; or urge from inside categories and follow our<br/>
inner truth about the next logical step.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t give you practical advice here, since I don&#39;t know your personal set-up. Just<br/>
listen within and you may find a lot of clarity already.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-353191012">I&#39;ve been reading this list for quite a while now but haven&#39;t commented<br/>
much.  However, your question about deschooling yourself interested me very<br/>
much.  I also have had a very hard time staying in the moment, letting our<br/>
life flow.  But when I do, it&#39;s so amazing!  What has been freeing me from<br/>
my expectations and rigidity has been movement.  I have always been very<br/>
cerebral, and intensely verbal.  I was also (I thought) active and fit.<br/>
When I was pregnant I broke my leg, and the resulting inactivity and eating<br/>
broke my body down.  I started doing yoga, and out of that emerged a<br/>
core-based, intuitive dance that is changing my life!  For me, it was body<br/>
that had to unlearn all its rigidity, and once my body found freedom my mind<br/>
has followed!  For the first time in my life I&#39;m interested in drawing and<br/>
color and I&#39;m able to immerse myself in play with my two year old son for<br/>
long, sustained periods, and, as has been noted on this list lately, this<br/>
mindfulness results in my son, who feels &quot;filled up&quot; with attention, is<br/>
willing to give me time to write or dance or cook.  Though he is only two-<br/>
and a half, when we are dialed into one another it even seems like he<br/>
intentionally makes room for me when he senses I need it.  Yet at other<br/>
times, when I was not as mindful, I wasn&#39;t even able to go to the bathroom<br/>
without him right there, climbing on my lap and trying to pull me off the<br/>
toilet!  Likewise with preparing meals, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Our life has a beautiful flow to it, with one activity growing out of<br/>
another, and all kinds of amazing synchronicity.<br/>
This new world, of shape and movement and color, is also a much needed<br/>
counter to my intellectual life, which has formerly driven me, at times,<br/>
over the cliff!  I never thought I could move or think the way I am<br/>
beginning to now.  I am also able to tolerate a great deal of external<br/>
chaos, which completely overwhelmed me before. For the first time I am<br/>
experiencing joy!<br/>
<br/>
Of course, we&#39;re still learning, or &quot;unlearning&quot; and I get stuck still.  But<br/>
this is how I have broken through.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1209644590">Oh, and the other thing I wanted to add: through play with my son I feel I<br/>
am learning.  Many things we do involve manipulating objects, touching<br/>
things, etc.  This kind of sensual learning was not part of my growing up, I<br/>
retreated into books and fantasy and had little contact with the world. This<br/>
sensual learning, as I am discovering, something against which I may test<br/>
ideas.  Skipping stones into the river, testing their weight in my hand,<br/>
rolling cars down a ramp, etc.  It is changing ME.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-149213209">Start from living in the moment. So, for example, while sitting with the baby <br/>
bird and your children watch them and listen to them and everytime you find your <br/>
thoughts moving toward something else, moving toward your list of things you <br/>
wished were getting done, bring it back to the baby bird and your son and your <br/>
daughter. Keep your eye on the prize of being with them fully and in the most <br/>
engaged way. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Simon and Linnaea were 4 and 1 once, they were 5 and 2 and 6 and 3 and so on and <br/>
so on. Now they are 13 and 10 and they are the ones who wander off from my <br/>
engagement. Not all the time and they are delightfully supportive of my <br/>
interests, although Simon did wrest the ukulele from my hands yesterday when I <br/>
was playing Meatloaf&#39;s 2 out of 3 ain&#39;t bad a bit too loudly. The horrible fact <br/>
of a lifetime is that it is like sands through the hourglass, it moves forward, <br/>
it shifts away from you. And while I have just been trying to fathom an article <br/>
on how physicists can&#39;t seem to come up with a reason for time being <br/>
uni-directional, in my day-to-day experience it just keeps flowing inexorably <br/>
one way. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It is easy to feel a need to do something more and greater and bigger, but in <br/>
the end, nothing is really more and greater and bigger than watching a big lorry <br/>
at a building site or helping a baby bird. Rough and ready garden&#39;s are good. <br/>
Ours is the most amazing bramble mine, the blackberries will be fantastic, and <br/>
the hedgehogs really do love it and it gives the mice a place to hide when the <br/>
tractors come (of course the cats do decimate them quite handily and then the <br/>
dog rolls on their guts &#39;cause nothing is quite as nice as eau de dead mouse, <br/>
but, well...). A tidy garden has fewer things to engage you and entice interest. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Look at the glow in their cheeks, the smiles, the curls of their hair, little <br/>
hands, little milk moustaches, or squash, or whatever it is that they like to <br/>
drink. Smell their heads, touch their arms, do the physical things that can pull <br/>
your interest, your focus back to them. Distraction is an easy thing, focus is <br/>
the trick. When all is said and done, when they have moved away from wanting to <br/>
be with you, engage with you, talk and giggle and play with you, what do you <br/>
want to get to look back on? If it&#39;s enjoying their each and every moment than <br/>
do that, start there. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-308866448"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Do you make lists? Lists can help. Put all the little details that you<br/>

refresh snack plates. Add another check-mark each time you do them.<br/>
Maybe that will help you see all the little things you do as things<br/>
getting done. I read some study, once upon a time, that found checking<br/>
things off a list creates a sense of satisfaction. (shrug) So make a<br/>
list that you Know you&#39;ll get to check things off. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a long time list maker (as most folks who know me already know - I<br/>
can hear you chuckling y&#39;know LOL) and I like the sense of<br/>
accomplishment with checking things off. But, more than that, it frees<br/>
up my mind to be in the moment because I know I won&#39;t forget something<br/>
that needs doing - it&#39;s on the list so I can go reference the list as<br/>
needed rather than constantly running the &#39;to-do&#39; stuff through my head.<br/>
And, on the list, in addition to &quot;grocery shopping&quot; and &quot;clean bathroom&quot;<br/>
(which by the way has sub-tasks listed &quot;mirror&quot;, &quot;sink/vanity&quot;,<br/>
&quot;toilet&quot;, &quot;shake out mat&quot;, &quot;sweep floor&quot;... so that I can check off<br/>
little pieces or do the whole thing, as time and energy permit), are<br/>
things like &quot;kiss husband repeatedly&quot;, &quot;hug &lt;DS&gt;&quot;, etc. When DS was<br/>
littler, he&#39;d make sure I added &quot;play &lt;game&gt;&quot; or &quot;watch &lt;video&gt;&quot; onto<br/>
the list. That way, he could look down the list for the familiar word(s)<br/>
and know about how long it was going to be &quot;Mommy is going to do 2<br/>
things and then we&#39;ll play&quot; or &quot;Play is the next thing on the list, I&#39;ll<br/>
go get the game ready&quot; or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
It might also be helpful to find something that you can do every day<br/>
that feels like &quot;accomplishing&quot; something - spritz and wash the bathroom<br/>
mirror, tidy the magazines on the table, whatever it is that helps you<br/>
feel &quot;there, I&#39;ve gotten something done&quot;. For example, I know that if I<br/>
keep my own desk space tidied, I feel more comfortable. I can leave the<br/>
rest of the house be if I just have that one area sorted.<br/>
<br/>
At our house, sometimes I do get into the &quot;I have x and y and z and m<br/>
and q and ... to do&quot; and DH will chime in &quot;and Gildor to frame for it&quot; -<br/>
that&#39;s a reference to the movie &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; (for those of you<br/>
who didn&#39;t get it right off). Basically, it&#39;s a reminder to take a<br/>
breath and slow down. There&#39;s no requirement that you get 10 things done<br/>
today - it might be 2, it might be 22, there&#39;s no &#39;rule&#39; for how much<br/>
needs to get done.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1971879186">***How can I lower my expectations of what gets done (my kids are only 2 anDSd nearly 4), but still feel fulfilled?***<br/>
<br/>
Maybe, instead of lowering your expectation of what gets done you could think differently about what you want to accomplish.  <br/>
<br/>
Instead of dishes and laundry and home repairs on your to-do list you could have, Delight Children, Play Games, Roll in Grass.   And somewhere in getting those things done you might squeeze in a load of laundry.   You can have a powerful sense of accomplishment from fulfilling the needs of your children, even if the bathroom is messy.  <br/>
<br/>
If your priority until now has been a well ordered home, I can understand how hard it is to let go of some of that.   Think about the things that really matter to you and do those things and let other stuff go.  <br/>
Find a way to get one of those things done in the morning while the children are still sleeping or at some other convenient time.  Get tools or cleaning aids that will make the job you want to do easier and faster.    Do one or two things today and one or two tomorrow.     Think of your home maintenance on a monthly or weekly scale instead of a daily one.  If laundry gets done once a week, consider that a success.  If the bathroom gets cleaned up a little once week, count that an accomplishment. <br/>
<br/>
At the end of the day when you&#39;re tired, resist thinking about what didn&#39;t get done.  Think instead about how happy your children are.   How they delighted in your attention, how they laughed when you all did a silly dance, how they enjoyed a romp in the yard.   Count those as important things crossed off your to-do list.  Stop counting the things that aren&#39;t there, that don&#39;t get done, as the important things.  Look at what did get done - The children laughed!  The toys were loved!  The day was full of sweetness!  In fourteen years you won&#39;t look back and remember that on August 13, 2010 the windows didn&#39;t get washed, but the sound of your baby&#39;s laughter or the little song your happy four year old sang will stay with you forever.  <br/>
<br/>
I can tell you from this end, my child all grown up, that a dirty house when he was two and three and four makes no difference to the world now.   No one remembers that a shower curtain got slimy or that the only clean spot on the floor was where the dog licked up the spilled spaghetti.  None of us could name the year the dishes always sat for three or four days before I got to them.   But we can all name the year of the big hole in the backyard, the summer of the squirrels, the Brio train track all through the house, the bowls filled with flour and dinosaurs on the kitchen table, the chains in the bathtub.   Those remembered things still bring joy to all of us.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1605646275">Hi and thanks to everyone who has replied.  I thought it would sound a<br/>
little like this!  But it is hard to let go of the things &#39;for yourself&#39;,<br/>
especially when everyone &#39;mainstream&#39; (sorry if that offends anyone, i can&#39;t<br/>
think of a better word right now) expects you to need and crave time off<br/>
from your kids.  Parenting seems to be sold as a 24hr job when they&#39;re<br/>
babies (you struggle through the nights while complaining), then a 12hr job,<br/>
cos of course they&#39;re going to sleep from 7 till 7, and that&#39;s when you get<br/>
your life back, right?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want my life back, I love what i have now, I&#39;m just still adjusting<br/>
to it!<br/>
<br/>
I think the idea of a journal would help me appreciate what i do get done.<br/>
 My housework standards are pretty low anyway, so not much room for slipping<br/>
there!  I think yoga also sounds great, now I don&#39;t have to be at home at<br/>
7.30 on the dor for bedtimes, i might even find a class!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the support and ideas,<br/>
Caroline.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-271428296">I just wanted to offer an idea to add to the lists...once upon a time, before my dd (just turned 3) was born, I was working on becoming a life coach. And one of the things that we (myself and the teacher from whom I was learning as well as others she worked with) hoped to impart on any clients was not only the &quot;doing&quot; that needed to get done in life, but also the &quot;being.&quot; How do any of us hope to feel as we do the things that we think are necessary and important?<br/>
<br/>
So, perhaps adding to your list, whether on paper or in your head, the feelings that you wish for every day. Eg. Be calm? focused? fun?when playing with the children. Be joyful when doing the dishes. Feel grateful for my home (despite the imperfections :) Maybe will help to shift the focus in ones mind.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Do you make lists? Lists can help. Put all the little details that you<br/>
&gt; do without thinking on a list, like: shut all the cabinet doors, and:<br/>
&gt; refresh snack plates. Add another check-mark each time you do them.<br/>
&gt; Maybe that will help you see all the little things you do as things<br/>
&gt; getting done. I read some study, once upon a time, that found checking<br/>
&gt; things off a list creates a sense of satisfaction. (shrug) So make a<br/>
&gt; list that you Know you&#39;ll get to check things off. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m a long time list maker (as most folks who know me already know - I<br/>
&gt; can hear you chuckling y&#39;know LOL) and I like the sense of<br/>
&gt; accomplishment with checking things off. But, more than that, it frees<br/>
&gt; up my mind to be in the moment because I know I won&#39;t forget something<br/>
&gt; that needs doing - it&#39;s on the list so I can go reference the list as<br/>
&gt; needed rather than constantly running the &#39;to-do&#39; stuff through my head.<br/>
&gt; And, on the list, in addition to &quot;grocery shopping&quot; and &quot;clean bathroom&quot;<br/>
&gt; (which by the way has sub-tasks listed &quot;mirror&quot;, &quot;sink/vanity&quot;,<br/>
&gt; &quot;toilet&quot;, &quot;shake out mat&quot;, &quot;sweep floor&quot;... so that I can check off<br/>
&gt; little pieces or do the whole thing, as time and energy permit), are<br/>
&gt; things like &quot;kiss husband repeatedly&quot;, &quot;hug &lt;DS&gt;&quot;, etc. When DS was<br/>
&gt; littler, he&#39;d make sure I added &quot;play &lt;game&gt;&quot; or &quot;watch &lt;video&gt;&quot; onto<br/>
&gt; the list. That way, he could look down the list for the familiar word(s)<br/>
&gt; and know about how long it was going to be &quot;Mommy is going to do 2<br/>
&gt; things and then we&#39;ll play&quot; or &quot;Play is the next thing on the list, I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; go get the game ready&quot; or whatever.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It might also be helpful to find something that you can do every day<br/>
&gt; that feels like &quot;accomplishing&quot; something - spritz and wash the bathroom<br/>
&gt; mirror, tidy the magazines on the table, whatever it is that helps you<br/>
&gt; feel &quot;there, I&#39;ve gotten something done&quot;. For example, I know that if I<br/>
&gt; keep my own desk space tidied, I feel more comfortable. I can leave the<br/>
&gt; rest of the house be if I just have that one area sorted.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At our house, sometimes I do get into the &quot;I have x and y and z and m<br/>
&gt; and q and ... to do&quot; and DH will chime in &quot;and Gildor to frame for it&quot; -<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s a reference to the movie &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; (for those of you<br/>
&gt; who didn&#39;t get it right off). Basically, it&#39;s a reminder to take a<br/>
&gt; breath and slow down. There&#39;s no requirement that you get 10 things done<br/>
&gt; today - it might be 2, it might be 22, there&#39;s no &#39;rule&#39; for how much<br/>
&gt; needs to get done.<br/>
