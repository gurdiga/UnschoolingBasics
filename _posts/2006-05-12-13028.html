&gt;hitting and screaming, for sure.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually no, he&#39;s kind of short and scrawny as far as men go.  Neither of us<br/>
usually pick her up and do things against her will, we always ask how she<br/>
wants to brush her teeth and try and give her as many choices as possible...<br/>
which toothbrush, which sink, which paste, mom/dad to help, do it herself,<br/>
and yes even standing or while we are holding her.  So everything leading up<br/>
to it was her choice.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;He should probably just remove himself from the situation the  <br/>
&gt;minute she hits - hitting ends the game, hitting ends the activity,  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She often hits during times that he can&#39;t just walk away like during bath,<br/>
that does usually end bath if it&#39;s feasible, but he&#39;s asked me for<br/>
suggestions about what to do if she&#39;s hitting him repeatedly and has a head<br/>
full of shampoo.  Any suggestions?<br/>

<br/>
First - he&#39;s HUGE compared to her. Please try to think from her point  <br/>
of view.<br/>
<br/>
Second - you might not be hearing what you, yourself, are saying?  <br/>
You&#39;re contradicting yourself.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>But in your first post you described, in detail, how he DID pick her  <br/>
up and brush her teeth against her will. Repeatedly.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;We took her into the bathroom to clean her up,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>like always.  When it came time to brush her teeth my husband picked<br/>
her up, she&#39;s lost interest in doing it herself and declined it<br/>
again, and she slapped him across the face.  We put her in time<br/>
out.  Afterwards we went back to the bathroom only to have the<br/>
scenario repeat. &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Are you fooling yourself? I think maybe you need to take a hard look  <br/>
at what is really going on, not what you wish.<br/>

tub, stand her up on the floor, and move away and say, &quot;No hitting.&quot;  <br/>
It is not kind to a child to let her hit you repeatedly.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Is he the main caregiver?  Maybe she would prefer a bath by mom...or with<br/>
mom.<br/>
Maybe she would prefer to have mom helping with her teeth at night?<br/>
<br/>
My son dearly loves his dad, but when he was 2...I always did everything<br/>
with him.<br/>
Dad was always under a time restraint and even though he never said<br/>
hurry...I think it was easily sensed.<br/>
<br/>
I have much more patience with the everyday happenings...<br/>
<br/>
