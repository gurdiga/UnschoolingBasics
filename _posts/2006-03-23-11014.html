  Okay, so how do you start dreads -- in caucasian hair, mind you -- without leaving it unwashed.  I mean, how can you wash hair you can&#39;t comb or untangle?  And how do you get hair tangled/tied/mashed together like that when it&#39;s clean?<br/>
   <br/>
  Real questions, in case the issue comes up again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1041386608"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Okay, so how do you start dreads -- in caucasian hair, mind you -- <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My husband has had dreads for about 3 years now, and he had the softest, <br/>
finest blonde hair you can possibly imagine. It wouldn&#39;t knot if you <br/>
tried. What we did was to separate it into sections, and back-comb each <br/>
section VERY tightly. Then we used dread wax, which is a blend of <br/>
beeswax and hemp oil, and rubbed it into each dread until it was pretty <br/>
well saturated. Now...once dreads are established, you CAN wash them, <br/>
but not with anything that has a moisturizing effect. For the first week <br/>
or two, though, the best way to get them to &#39;take&#39; is not to wash them <br/>
at all. They lock up best, we found, if you stick your hair up in a tam <br/>
and just leave it there, day and night, for a couple weeks. The dread <br/>
wax has this wonderful honey smell, and keeps the dirty-hair smell away <br/>
until you wash it. But if you wash it too soon, before it&#39;s knotted up <br/>
really well, the hot water you use will just melt the wax and the dreads <br/>
will start to unravel. He washes it as often as anyone else, with plain <br/>
old castille soap, and it seems to come clean. From the way that he <br/>
scrubs it, I imagine the soap gets in there pretty well.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1862860816">I actually had a friend put dreads in my hair in November (then i chickened<br/>
out and took then out the next day, I&#39;m a wimp! I know!! )<br/>
<br/>
She put a very tight perm in my hair first, to make it more &#39;ethnic&#39;, but if<br/>
you do this, make sure you are going to commit to the dreads, cuz if you<br/>
don&#39;t, you are left with some crazy funky  hair to deal with! (this, i know<br/>
to be true)<br/>
<br/>
Then, she took sections and back-combed the life out (or into?) them, from<br/>
root to tip, so the chunk of hair literally stood up by itself.  Then, she<br/>
used some dread wax and rolled it in, like she was making playdough snakes.<br/>
<br/>
There is a whole lot of really good information on knottboy.com.  You can<br/>
learn a lot about dreads there, and also buy the products to start and<br/>
maintain  your dreads.  They tell you everything from how to do them, to why<br/>
you should keep your dreads clean, to what to do when &#39;the itchies&#39; strike.<br/>
<br/>
Have a great time! <br/>

That is very true! Sierra wanted dreads last year so I spent hours<br/>
trying to form them in her hair. Two days after we put them in, we are<br/>
at the L&L conference where she was in the pool constantly. We tried<br/>
and tried to keep them up, to no avail.<br/>
I thought we&#39;d have to cut the whole mess out, but after we moved up<br/>
here to TN, I spent a few nights conditioning it really well and<br/>
slowly working it all out. It wasn&#39;t much fun for either of us.<br/>
<br/>
My friend Nielah had recommended pure beeswax, but Erika (at the<br/>
conference) said it&#39;s too heavy for caucasion hair. We learned a lot<br/>
through our &quot;Dreadful&quot; experience and if anyone chooses dreads again,<br/>
we&#39;ll be better prepared!!:)<br/>

myself but my hair grows so slow that if I don&#39;t like them I worry about<br/>
