***So, while it may never be automatic in<br/>
the same way as more reactive behavior, I think the awareness itself and<br/>
the humility that goes along with it becomes automatic.***<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s right.  And now when I&#39;m about to react I get that awareness on<br/>
that first intake of breath, and I can stop myself from saying whatever<br/>
it is should never be said. (usually)  I&#39;m waiting, at forty two and with<br/>
a thirteen year old son, I&#39;m waiting for the moment I realize the<br/>
automatic negative reaction is gone completely but I suspect it will be<br/>
with me forever.  I am happy at least it&#39;s internal and those words/that<br/>
attitude doesn&#39;t spill out on my kid.<br/>
<br/>
***And kids who are parented with generosity, respect and understanding<br/>
tend to be pretty darn generous, respectful and understanding of<br/>
momentary shortcomings themselves.***<br/>
<br/>
This is one of the many side effects of unschooling.  While schools have<br/>
special classes to teach respect and other parents ground or punish kids<br/>
who &quot;talk back&quot; we live lives of reciprocal esteem.   And most glorious<br/>
of all my son doesn&#39;t feel that life is unfair, like so many of his<br/>
friends do, because some rules of consideration apply to kids an not to<br/>
adults.<br/>
