We don&#39;t  give any &quot; lessons&quot; on milking cows but if any of you ever want to <br/>
come milk  some we can certainly show you how.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
are you near me? i&#39;d love it!! (southern ca) and so would the kids :) we  <br/>
were just talking about how we (julian, my 4 year old and i) want a farm-like  <br/>
home, so we can have fresh eggs, fresh milk and grow more veggies. right now, we <br/>
 live in Cementsville, lol (j/k!) and have no yard and a micro-poch where we <br/>
have  some containers of plants and few veggies. <br/>
