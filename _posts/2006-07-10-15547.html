<div id="ygrps-yiv-826924710">~I&#39;m sure if any RU&#39;ers heard our house, they would be<br/>
uncomfortable, but it&#39;s not really from control, it&#39;s from everyone&#39;s<br/>

<br/>
Controlling food for children is what leads to the idea of &quot;fair&quot; or<br/>
&quot;not fair&quot;. Fair is that everybody gets the foods they want. A 2y.o.<br/>
doesn&#39;t need what a 16 y.o. needs and a child that really wants<br/>
chocolate right now doesn&#39;t need what the kid that wants broccoli is<br/>
asking for.<br/>
Sometimes one person needs/wants more of something than the other people.<br/>
<br/>
If you aren&#39;t controlling portions or focusing so much on doling out<br/>
exact amounts that are &quot;fair&quot; it will all work out.  If my children<br/>
are eating a lot of something, that&#39;s my cue to buy more, not start<br/>
portioning it. <br/>
<br/>
Keep the foods they love well stocked, or make something similar. A<br/>
snack tray out all day is a great idea, but trying to portion<br/>
everything up to be &quot;fair&quot; doesn&#39;t work out so well in my opinion. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2097812995">~And it&#39;s interesting to me that you<br/>
mention unhealthy choices in the future: giving kids zero chance to<br/>
practice making choices now in my opinion generally leads to an<br/>
impaired ability (to varying degrees) to make good choices in the<br/>
future.~<br/>
<br/>
Absolutely.<br/>
I think it&#39;s interesting to think that a parent that does not trust a<br/>
toddler will somehow miraculously learn to trust an 8 y.o. <br/>
Trust is something we learn because it&#39;s a good thing for all<br/>
relationships, not something we save for when the child MIGHT make<br/>
choices in line with our own philosophies.<br/>
<br/>
Setting them up to make choices from day one, helps them learn their<br/>
own bodies and how to make the best choices for themselves for life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2033111493">this is why my son has imput on the making of the grocery list I <br/>
always ask what he wants on the list, what he is feeling like and <br/>
then of course he goes to the store with me anyway.I just make sure <br/>
to buy a &quot;reasonable ammount&quot; of the things he has requested.<br/>
<br/>
 I find that if I know what he wants to eat that<br/>
 1) it will get eaten and not hang arround getting old and nasty <br/>
(because some food he likes I can&#39;t stand and vice versa) &<br/>
2)that I can buy more of whatever it is he wants to eat and none of <br/>
whatever it is that might have been popular with him last month.<br/>
of course if I buy a reasonable ammount of somthing he requested and <br/>
its gone in a flash, its still gone and we will have to think of <br/>
what else to have next time but that is where creativity comes in at <br/>
our home!<br/>
Galen may want another yougurt after eating them all but if I <br/>
encourage him to think up somthing different or offer to help him <br/>
make a creamy jello salad he is happy to have that.<br/>
<br/>
 So he might have wanted one thing but when that thing is all gone <br/>
its time to get creative.<br/>
<br/>
this also helps him to be able to define what is is about yougurt <br/>
that he wanted. (thuss to know himself better)<br/>
quick, cold, creamy... or did he want it because it was strawberry <br/>
flavor? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-540957688">Okay, the rest of the paragraph was important to discussion. We have  <br/>
three kids with food allergies, one to corn products, two have celiac  <br/>
disease, both potentially fatal. So when we talk about food that is  <br/>
fair or not fair, we&#39;re discussing that Sam and Dan can only have  <br/>
food with no wheat starch, gluten, germ, etc. So yes, it&#39;s fair that  <br/>
Rachel and Emily eat the regular graham crackers, and leave the wheat  <br/>
free ones for Sam and Dan. They are asking because they want to be  <br/>
fair to their brothers, they want to ensure that they are not eating  <br/>
the safe food.<br/>
<br/>
People in our family get what they want to a certain extent. We work  <br/>
very hard to provide alternatives to what is available to everyone  <br/>
else. It does not have to do with controlling portions or exact  <br/>
amounts, it has to do with not eating all the food that is safe for  <br/>
the boys, or if Breanna can only have goldfish, it&#39;s really uncool to  <br/>
eat all the goldfish, leaving only crackers and snacks with corn  <br/>
starch and corn syrup. Hopefully that will make things more clear.<br/>
<br/>
Some families go all wheat free, but honestly that will not work.  <br/>
When the generic graham crackers are a dollar a box, the wheat-free  <br/>
ones are approximately $12 for the same amount. So we buy a box of  <br/>
wheat free for the boys, a box of corn free for Bre, and a couple of  <br/>
boxes for everyone else.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My oldest daughter and I are both allergic to dairy. So we get Rice  <br/>
Dream instead of Ice Cream - for example. Some of the stuff we get is  <br/>
REALLY good and everybody loves it - but it IS more expensive. I&#39;d  <br/>
rather get regular ice cream sandwiches for others and keep the  <br/>
tofuti cuties for Roya and me AND I admit it can be annoying when I  <br/>
open the freezer and it is full of ice cream, but the soy or rice- <br/>
based stuff is empty.<br/>
<br/>
So - I get the issue.<br/>
<br/>
The other members of our family realizes that if there is ice cream  <br/>
and Rice Dream in the freezer - those of us with allergies will get  <br/>
the short end of the stick if they eat the Rice Dream and leave the  <br/>
ice cream. So they just won&#39;t do that to us. They might have a bit of  <br/>
it, but they wouldn&#39;t clean us out. One of my other kids asked me to  <br/>
get her one certain type of Rice Dream that she really likes. That&#39;s  <br/>
fine - it is all a process - the goal is to be as considerate and  <br/>
kind to each other as possible - not to get the most ice cream &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Still - it might be useful to you to think of this in terms of  <br/>
everybody &quot;getting&quot; what they need - rather than in terms of what is  <br/>
&quot;fair&quot; -- that word, &quot;fair,&quot; has a lot of baggage for most people.   <br/>
Just a little perspective change....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-606665408">~I just want my kids to have experience healthily choices.No they have<br/>
never had full freedom of eating me out of house and home.Believe me<br/>
my kids never go Hungary.Food is never withheld. I just have the kids<br/>
make healthily choices.~<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a true choice if you&#39;re deciding how it all works.<br/>
You can&#39;t &quot;have them make&quot; healthy choices, you can either let them<br/>
choose or not. Not much of a choice.<br/>
<br/>
You say they never had full freedom of &quot;eating me out of house and<br/>
home&quot; and then you say they never go hungry. How would you KNOW that<br/>
for sure? If you&#39;re deciding they need to stop eating, how on earth<br/>
can they listen to their bodies? How can you possibly know for sure<br/>
that they aren&#39;t hungry sometimes (apparently they want more food than<br/>
you&#39;re willing to let them eat) or maybe eating when they aren&#39;t<br/>
hungry over fear of loss?<br/>
<br/>
How can food never be withheld if you don&#39;t let them eat when they<br/>
choose? The above paragraph is full of contradictions.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you&#39;re somehow projecting the cruddy job your Mum did<br/>
of exposing you to new foods and helping you get the foods you love,<br/>
onto our advice. Believing that my kids can eat what they want, when<br/>
they want it, does not mean I&#39;m not offering healthy choices, making<br/>
wonderful foods and sharing cooking with them. We do.<br/>
Try not to connect your childhood to anything we are discussing, it&#39;s<br/>
two very different things and won&#39;t foster any understanding of RU<br/>
principles in regards to food.<br/>

  would you mind mailing me with how much of each? <br/>
   <br/>
  my autistic little boy really does better wheat and preferably gluten free but premade stuff is incredibly expensive and just not in our budget. Plus we pretty much have to rely on foodstamps right now and I dont thing Mrs Robens and online places like that take them . <br/>
   <br/>
  Right now his 2 big favorites are pizza and hamburgers ...or anything tasty stuffed in a bun <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1796474627">I know this is kind of OT, but people have been discussing nutrition <br/>
and special food circumstances, and preparing snacks within a <br/>
budget...<br/>
<br/>
I know many people on the list are dealing with allergies and food <br/>
sensitivities. I have recently begun to eliminate gluten for myself <br/>
and have been reading many books and trying many recipes. I started <br/>
out with the rice flour, soy flour, tapioca flour, corn starch, guar <br/>
gum, garfava flour, sorgum flour, etc. I think it took me 19 <br/>
ingredients to make the waffles the other day, LOL (though they were <br/>
fantastic)<br/>
<br/>
I got a great book from the library called &quot;The Gluten-Free Gourmet <br/>
Bakes Bread&quot; which gives recipes for bulk mixes to make it easier to <br/>
prepare things quickly.<br/>
<br/>
The neatest book I got, however, is called &quot;Cooking wih Coconut <br/>
Flour&quot;. These recipes look just like wheat recipes (in that there <br/>
are no &quot;extra&quot; crazy, expensive ingredients in them. The amounts of <br/>
the ingredients are different, though, generally using many more <br/>
eggs. All the recipes are gluten free, soy free, trans fat free, <br/>
artificial sweetener free, and yeast free. Some can use stevia to <br/>
replace some of the sugar, if desired.<br/>
<br/>
Thought I would put this out here for those in similar <br/>
circumstances, since there have been posts on wheat free stuff <br/>
recently. <br/>

how it becomes a problem (in and of itself it is not a problem - our<br/>
bodies make cholesterol and need -some- to be healthy).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, and there&#39;s a lot of evidence that points to an overly acidic<br/>
diet being the true problem. As we age, it&#39;s natural for our bodies to<br/>
make more cholesterol to some degree. For those that have too much<br/>
acid in the diet, it could be wearing away at the arteries and<br/>
therefore the body responds by protecting the arteries with cholesterol. <br/>
You don&#39;t see this buildup in vessels, but only arteries, where the<br/>
blood pressure is stronger. Hmmmm?<br/>
<br/>
I worked in the health industry for many, many years, keeping up on<br/>
all the latest research and counseling people on how to make healthy<br/>
lifestyle changes (as membership director for more than one large<br/>
health club). What I learned at that time (and it could have changed)<br/>
is that diet only affects cholesterol levels by 11% roughly.<br/>
Not much.<br/>
<br/>
I do wonder if any of the studies on diet and cholesterol levels ever<br/>
concluded that changing the diet to a more alkaline level, affected<br/>
cholesterol greater than the aforementioned 11% that was based on<br/>
cutting animal fats.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, animal fats are obviously not the main culprit. How else do<br/>
you explain the high fat diets of both the French and Greenlanders<br/>
with extremely low heart disease?  <br/>
<br/>
The whole point is, everyone will come to their own conclusions. I<br/>
just hope my children will inform themselves and continue to listen to<br/>
their own bodies.<br/>
