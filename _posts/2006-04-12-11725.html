<div id="ygrps-yiv-1766930677">Michelle and Ren....<br/>
<br/>
Thank you both for the input,it&#39;s greatly appreciated.  We do not<br/>
often go the NE side of town but my husband says that the past few<br/>
times he&#39;s seen them that that is what is done each time.  None of the<br/>
women or children were dressed up although a couple of boys had on<br/>
knight type gear, however, there were quiet a few men dressed up as<br/>
knights.  Is that pretty much it for the Pensacola chapter? <br/>
<br/>
~Respectfully, Sandy<br/>
<br/>
BTW...I completely understand that this is a WONDERFUL organization<br/>
and didn&#39;t take your comments Michelle, as a slam on the SCA,<br/>
afterall, you said how great it was elsewhere.  Thank you for your<br/>
invite to seek more information, I&#39;ll let Zak know that that&#39;s pretty<br/>
much it and see if he&#39;s still interested.  He hasn&#39;t spoken about it<br/>
at all since Sunday, may have just been a fleeting thought.</div>
