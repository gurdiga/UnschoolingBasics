<div id="ygrps-yiv-1104586935">It&#39;s OK by me, Sam. I&#39;m delighted to know that such a thing as united  <br/>
punk parents exists, though my own punk days are 20 years in the past.<br/>

hours away in East TN.  I was perusing Myspace when I noticed the<br/>
band&#39;s schedule and remembering some of the punk parents discussing<br/>
the club.<br/>
Not sure where you are, but coming toward the end of April is Ska<br/>
Weekend here in Ktown, and it&#39;s going to be awesome.  It&#39;s a whole day<br/>
ska festival, several stages.  We&#39;ve taken the boys three years in a<br/>
row now and are sooooo excited for this next one.<br/>
Actually, the first that we attended was three years ago, so the<br/>
youngest may not have quite been here all the way at the time</div>

  Mind if I ask what Ktown is? Knoxville? We are in Mississippi 5 miles from the Memphis TN border.<br/>

  Whew I gotta have a talk with this little about the lip piercing thing. She&#39;s 6 lol. What the heck is she going to be wanting to do at 16?<br/>
   <br/>
  She had picture day at school and came home mad. She shot up her little punk rock sign ( anarchy sign) and the photographer told her to put her hands down. <br/>
   <br/>
  Sigh ok Ill shut up now. She decided to take a break for the past 5 days and went back to school today. I miss her already! <br/>
