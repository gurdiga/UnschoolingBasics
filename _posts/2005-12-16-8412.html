sense to me.  it certainly doesn&#39;t seem to bother her, but does me.  hmm?<br/>
interesting!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>all very good points.  I will take this advice with me into the next<br/>
interaction I have with this child.  You&#39;re right.  Our relationship can be<br/>
just that, ours.  I don&#39;t have to accept behaviors that make me feel icky,<br/>
and I really think that we could learn a lot from each other.  thanks so<br/>
much for your insight!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I can&#39;t help wondering why your son wants to hang out with this child<br/>
&gt; when the result for him is usually frustration and tears.  Is it<br/>
&gt; because there&#39;s a lack of other friends available to get together<br/>
&gt; with?  If that&#39;s the case, I think if I were you I&#39;d focus on forming<br/>
&gt; some new friendships that were better fits for my children.<br/>
&gt; Sorry if I missed some info that makes my advice moot. :-)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I try to understand why he wants to hang out with him, too.  And when he<br/>
gets frustrated/teary, etc, we talk about it and why it is he might be<br/>
feeling that way.  <br/>
You did hit the  nail on the head, though.  Our homeschooling community is<br/>
VERY small here.  So I have been trying to be creative and try to get him<br/>
involved with some new friends.  I have seen that when he has a choice<br/>
between he and another little guy, he chooses the other.<br/>
Ok, got me thinking now.  I guess its up to  me to offer more nourishing<br/>
relationships and opportunities for him.  Thanks much!<br/>

(update:  yesterday, thursday, after tae kwon do, ds went to a friend&#39;s<br/>
house and spent the whole day there and had a very nice time, i took the 4yo<br/>
ds and baby with me to a separate play day, where 4 yo had some time of his<br/>
own, so everyone was very happy and we all had a glorious time- we&#39;re on to<br/>
something here!)</div>

that we treat our  home and each other.  With love and respect.<br/>
Thanks for your support and input on this, Robyn.  It&#39;s good to be able to<br/>
put something like this out there and get some really helpful, productive<br/>
feedback.  I appreciate it!<br/>
<br/>
Namaste~<br/>
