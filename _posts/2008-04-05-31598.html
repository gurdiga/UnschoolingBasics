<div id="ygrps-yiv-2032882573">My 11 yr old son just came to me with a list of words to look up. I <br/>
asked him where they came from and he said pokemon diamond! Apparently <br/>
I looked confused, because he continued to inform me that you visit <br/>
this old guy in a house and he asks you if you &quot;want to learn a trendy <br/>
new saying?&quot; You say yes or no, and if you say yes he gives you a new <br/>
word!<br/>
Here are the words he gave me:bone <br/>
density,flambe,neutrino,cubism,GMT,polyphenol and starboard.<br/>
<br/>
Just something I can keep in mind when I start getting worried that <br/>
video games are not time well spent!<br/>
