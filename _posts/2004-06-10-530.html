reasonable limits and gentle parenting.<br/>

sometimes phone calls are more important than &quot;Hey, Mom, look at  this cool <br/>
thing I drew.&quot; If the house was on fire or the kid was injured,  the phone <br/>
call <br/>
would not be as important. <br/>
<br/>
Just life, imo. Which  has limits but doesn&#39;t have to have more than <br/>
necessary.  **<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
This just sounds really down to earth.  I think I was beginning to  feel <br/>
guilty if there was ANYTHING that seemed more important than what  my kids are <br/>
doing RIGHT NOW.  Maybe that was just a swing a  little to far from the <br/>
controlling/disciplining type of parenting.   Yes, my kids are very important and so is <br/>
what they think/make/do, but sometimes  I have something on the stove, or I&#39;m <br/>
on the phone (not just chatting, but  taking care of family business or <br/>
whatever).<br/>
 <br/>
**You made groceries more important than your baby.  That sounds harsh  but<br/>
I hope you can think about this in a new way. What if you had to go by  more <br/>
milk?  The price of milk is not greater<br/>
than your sons comfort and  happiness.** <br/>
 <br/>
I am trying to think about this in a new way, and nothing is more  important <br/>
than my baby. But he&#39;s actually 3.5, almost 4 now, and does  gentle parneting <br/>
not allow you to say, *I love you and you are important to me,  but we need to <br/>
go home and put away our groceries before they spoil.*  If  he understands <br/>
that, great. But if he doesn&#39;t, we still need to be able to do  things that he <br/>
doesn&#39;t yet understand sometimes.  In my family right now  every penny counts, <br/>
twice:)  Every time we waste money, I have to be away  from my family more as <br/>
I am the *primary breadwinner*  for a little while  longer.  I actually went <br/>
to the grocery store before picking him up so that  I wouldn&#39;t have to take a <br/>
tired child in the grocery store, I actually was  thinking about what was best <br/>
for him well in advance.<br/>
<br/>
**Surely you&#39;ve &quot;wasted&quot; a few dollars on something that would  brighten<br/>
your day, a new lipstick or nail polish or something.**<br/>
 <br/>
Not in a long time.  And I don&#39;t resent that.  Actually my  weakness would be <br/>
music or toys for the kids.  But my husband has been in  school fulltime for <br/>
two years as part of a career change.  He has been out  of the house six days <br/>
a week, mostly twelve hours days, so that he can have a  more stable long term <br/>
job and take over the bread winner position.  We are  all really looking <br/>
forward to that.<br/>
 <br/>
I hope that doesn&#39;t sound ultra defensive and I REALLY DO take all the  <br/>
advice seriously.  I appreciate everone for taking the time to read, think  about <br/>
and respond to other peoples problems and questions.<br/>

Hi, Cheryl,<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t sound super defensive to me, just like you are trying to figure<br/>
this all out, and I give you loads of credit for asking your questions,<br/>
listening to answers that may be hard to hear, and trying to work out<br/>
something new.  I am really a big advocate of &quot;answers that feel like they<br/>
work for all of you&quot;.  The bottom line to me in this situation would be that<br/>
my son not only hear he is important to me by my saying those word but feel<br/>
that too.  If I force him into his carseat he will not feel this.  Part of<br/>
it is knowing by trial and error what might work with your particular kid to<br/>
possibly work something out.  With mine I might try something like &quot;I hear<br/>
how much you really want to drive the car right now and not wait.  And it<br/>
does sound like fun!  Mommy would really like to get the milk home so it&#39;s<br/>
not yucky and we don&#39;t have to throw it out.  How about if I get you one of<br/>
those [insert name of something you bought at the store he might like to<br/>
have] we bought at the store to eat in your carseat for now, and then when<br/>
we get home in the driveway, you can sit with me and help me drive up to the<br/>
front door?  Then you could practice your pretend driving while Mommy gets<br/>
the groceries inside?&quot;  This might or might not fly depending on his mood,<br/>
how much he would like a popsicle and how open to compromise he feels.  I<br/>
would spend some time trying other ideas (sing a special song, hey, after<br/>
you drive us up the driveway we could do our fun races you like).  Bottom<br/>
line, I&#39;ve found he feels more like meeting me halfway if he feels his needs<br/>
are heard or he finds a fun alternative that feels okay.  If none of my<br/>
ideas made it, and it really came down a choice of forcing him into the seat<br/>
or losing the milk, even on a tight budget (which is true of us also), I&#39;d<br/>
chaulk the milk up to a loss this one time and likely try to arrange not to<br/>
get perishible items with my son in tow until he is older and you could<br/>
perhaps make a deal he could both understand and stick to (which certainly<br/>
my 3 1/2 yr old couldn&#39;t do at this age yet) ahead of time to get the<br/>
perishible items home quickly.  Maybe your husband could pick up perishibles<br/>
on the way home from work instead - or you could work out some other kind of<br/>
arrangement.  That&#39;s not as convenient, but it honors both your needs.<br/>
<br/>
To speak to Nance&#39;s post, which makes lots of sense to me, weighing and<br/>
measuring the importance of things is an ongoing challenge and I think<br/>
questioning what Ren called our &quot;knee jerk reactions&quot; is really important<br/>
part of that.  I&#39;ve found my own sense of &quot;what seems more important and<br/>
what doesn&#39;t seem mroe important&quot; to have changed a lot.  No matter what<br/>
your choice of what&#39;s important and what&#39;s not is at any given point in<br/>
time, the way in which you communicate that to your child and taking time<br/>
and patience to include and balance their needs with yours will make all the<br/>
difference.  My kids have a lot of difficulty with me being on the phone.<br/>
It is a need I have to be on it sometimes, and not always when they are<br/>
completely distracted.  I&#39;ve found with my daughter that the issue is &quot;it<br/>
feels endless&quot;.  So if I commit to a certain amount of time and set the<br/>
timer she feels okay giving me space to have my call knowing that the timer<br/>
will go off and I&#39;ll respect her need for me to get off.  The particulars of<br/>
how you work it out are not that important, but what feels important to me<br/>
is finding the patience and being tenacious and caring enough of my children<br/>
to include their needs.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps...<br/>
<br/>
Joan</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1270651980">Thanks Joan<br/>
 <br/>
That does help alot.  You gave me alot of good ideas.  Using the  timer for <br/>
phone calls could be a godsend.<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;No matter what your choice of what&#39;s important and what&#39;s not is at  any <br/>
given point in<br/>
time, the way in which you communicate that to your child  and taking time<br/>

 <br/>
That is going on my fridge in big letters.  <br/>
 <br/>
Thank you again Joan and everyone for your thoughtful responses.<br/>
