That&#39;s the beauty of an unschooling conference...it&#39;s for the whole <br/>

weekend?<br/>
Time away from the kids is NOT an issue at Live and Learn!:)<br/>

that isnt an option here, unfortunately I rescue small breed dogs- mostly  <br/>
dachshunds and my kids help with that too but I really dont have anyone I can  <br/>
trust for an entire weekend.  we havent even had a vacation in 5 years--  not <br/>
complaining mind you-- it saves a bunch of money and there are still day  trips <br/>
:)  ( 6 hrs or less)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-456205106">There isn&#39;t anyone to care for the animals, and even if there were, <br/>
our finances wouldn&#39;t allow the trip.  I can&#39;t even make it to town <br/>
for groceries right now.  :)<br/>
