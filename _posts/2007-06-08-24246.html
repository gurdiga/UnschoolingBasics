<div id="ygrps-yiv-1303578438">I&#39;m having a really hard time reading your responses. It would help if you <br/>
delineated somehow--a line, a series of asterisks, or even just a space--  <br/>
between your writing and the writing you are responding to.<br/>
<br/>
Every one of your posts is defending two things as far as I can interpret. <br/>
The first is that this girl was an individual situation from which no <br/>
inferences can be drawn. And to some extent that it was the evilness of the <br/>
girl&#39;s character that resulted in both her sneaking behind her parents&#39; <br/>
backs to continue her relationship and in her boyfriend&#39;s subsequent <br/>
murdering of her parents. And while no one is saying that the murder of her <br/>
parents is justified by their decisions about her dating at the age of 13, <br/>
it is being said that in an open, trusting home she may not have felt that <br/>
she was being asked to choose between her family and her young man.<br/>
<br/>
The second thing that you seem to be repeating ad nauseum is that anyone who <br/>
loves their children can only choose to restrict their dating at a young <br/>
age. For me I can only argue from the hypothetical, my two children aren&#39;t <br/>
interested in dating, and are only 7 and 10 so it isn&#39;t something that is <br/>
likely to come up for a couple of years at least.<br/>
<br/>
I love my children. I overflow with love for my children. When I look at <br/>
them, play with them, brush their hair, watch them playing, listen to them, <br/>
fix them ice cream cones, cuddle them, I love them. It is a huge part of <br/>
what defines me. I know things about them that I know my parents didn&#39;t know <br/>
about me. And not because I pry or eavesdrop or follow them around or get <br/>
someone else to report back to me, but because they tell me. They share who <br/>
they are and what they are interested in with me because I&#39;m really unlikely <br/>
to make fun of them and their interests, and because I am more than likely <br/>
to take part in their interests with them, and have been known to help <br/>
facilitate those interests for them. I would never choose to shut down those <br/>
doors of communication by denying them something that interested them as <br/>
much as being with a person that they cared for, no matter their age. I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be over-the-moon about Linnaea at 14 dating an 18 year old, just as <br/>
an idea. But I would trust that she had reasons for finding this 18 year old <br/>
appealing and I would hope that she would be comfortable with letting us get <br/>
to know him.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that if it had been a more open environment between the <br/>
parents and their daughter, there would have been more time for her to <br/>
really discover if it was this boy she wanted to be with, instead of the <br/>
little time there was of the excitement and adrenaline that comes from <br/>
sneaking around. I mean, what a brilliant way to make dating exciting, boost <br/>
the normal hormonal response with the rush of the adrenal system! I&#39;m not <br/>
saying that he wouldn&#39;t have killed them anyhow, but maybe she would have <br/>
chosen to leave him if they&#39;d trusted her and supported her in the choices <br/>
she made. Maybe she would have been able to judge him more clearly if her <br/>
vision wasn&#39;t blurred by her parents disapproval.<br/>

&gt; Those kids who &#39;do what they want&#39; no matter what you try to teach them --  <br/>
&gt; first, why would they want to do things that are harmful to them? What <br/>
&gt; unmet need do they have? When a kid doesn&#39;t care about their own safety, <br/>
&gt; and doesn&#39;t listen to his parents&#39; concerns, that&#39;s a kid who doesn&#39;t feel <br/>
&gt; his parents understand him, where he is right in that moment.<br/>
&gt; Probably because we live in a &quot;feel good&quot; generation, where all alot of <br/>
&gt; people want is to feel good regardless of the consequences or if what they <br/>
&gt; are doing is harmful or not. Some kids don&#39;t want to listen to their <br/>
&gt; parents concerns, even if they have understanding parents. Are you telling <br/>
&gt; me you have never seen this??<br/>

It seems to me that if it had been a more open environment between the<br/>
parents and their daughter, there would have been more time for her to<br/>
really discover if it was this boy she wanted to be with, instead of the<br/>
little time there was of the excitement and adrenaline that comes from<br/>
sneaking around.~~<br/>
<br/>
Exactly!<br/>
Back in medieval times, girls that age were being married off in some<br/>
societies. So &quot;proper&quot; age for sex and dating are hugely deteremined<br/>
by societal factors which have NOTHING to do with the individuals<br/>
readiness.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that in an open, trusting home, kids often feel LESS<br/>
inclined to have sex young.  I know so many unschooled teens (several<br/>
which are sexually active and they seem to make their choices about<br/>
sex with so much more thought and pondering. I certainly didn&#39;t think<br/>
much about anything when I had sex at 16. It wasn&#39;t a true choice!<br/>
<br/>
My 17 year old puts a lot of thought and care into his choices. It&#39;s<br/>
really cool to see.<br/>
<br/>
And unschooled kids are FAR from &quot;left to figure it out themselves&quot;<br/>
just because we aren&#39;t trying to control their choices. In a mindful<br/>
family, choices are discussed, weighed, every members needs considered<br/>
and creative adaptations made constantly. <br/>
<br/>
When both of my kids want the front seat in the van and we sit in the<br/>
driveway, my input is &quot;let&#39;s figure out something that works for<br/>
everyone&quot;.  Yeah, sometimes one person has to wait, but its<br/>
interesting to hear their negotiations. &quot;I know, I&#39;ll sit in back now<br/>
but I get it on the way home ok?&quot; or &quot;you got to sit here yesterday,<br/>
so can I have it first today?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sure, sitting in the front seat is a small thing, but if families can<br/>
negotiate and problem solve while putting everyone&#39;s needs as<br/>
priority, THEN there is a pattern set for solving bigger issues. Kids<br/>
trust that the adults care about their needs.<br/>
<br/>
I would assume that a 13 year old girl truly wanting sex would find a<br/>
way to have it whether the parents forbid it or not(oh yeah, thats<br/>
already been proven). I would assume she had some underlying need and<br/>
it would be my job to figure out what that need was. I would also<br/>
assume that her relationship with the 18 year old was her relationship<br/>
and I would not have a right to terminate that (oh yeah, that doesn&#39;t<br/>
work either...interesting)<br/>
<br/>
I might invite that person over to our house a lot if I had concerns<br/>
about his behavior (which would  have NOTHING to do with his age). I<br/>
don&#39;t intend to be a wall between my children and their lives. They<br/>
will make their own choices with or without me anyway, I have much<br/>
more influence as a connected, aware parent that they TRUST.<br/>
<br/>
But we&#39;re talking about a family that was not unschooling. We&#39;re<br/>
talking about a unique and bizarre situation that probably nobody<br/>
truly understands (including people that knew them) and that isn&#39;t<br/>
going to help anyone understand unschooling or gentle parenting. So<br/>
lets move on. PLEASE.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1712266444">Sorry if you can&#39;t read my responses. They seem fine on my computer. <br/>
<br/>
I am not &quot;defending&quot; anything. There is nothing to interpret from my <br/>
posts. I am very clear in what I am saying and how I feel.<br/>
<br/>
And I never said that the evilness of this girls character led to her <br/>
parents murder. Again another interpretation of what I was saying <br/>
here. I am sure that you all know the same thign that was printed in <br/>
the paper and on teh news, and that was that he murdered them because <br/>
he was told he could not see her any longer. The fact that he brought <br/>
along guns has nothing to do with the possibility that maybe he was <br/>
crazy and planned on  carrying this out anyway?? The fact that he and <br/>
2 other teens were &quot;practicing&quot; home invasions shortly before all of <br/>
this happened, I am guessing also had nothing to do with his <br/>
character. In the end it seems that everyone here is defending <br/>
this &quot;poor&quot; girl and her boyfriend, and blaming it all on her dead <br/>
parents for caring about her.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe there are people on here that don&#39;t even know the facts behind <br/>
this case. Allow me to go over the facts again, with the help of one <br/>
of the articles;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
According to Ludwig, Borden had spent the night at his house, after <br/>
which he had dropped her off at home around 5:30 am. <br/>
***Outstanding behavior that this 14 year old exemplified***<br/>
<br/>
Ludwig waited for a text message from Borden, letting him know that <br/>
she had successfully made it back without incident, presumably by <br/>
sneaking into the house undetected. However, the text message never <br/>
came. After several attempts to reach Borden, Ludwig finally <br/>
contacted her at around 6:15 am. Borden informed him that she had <br/>
gotten caught and asked him to come over so her parents could talk to <br/>
him. At this point, Ludwig grabbed two guns and a hunting knife and <br/>
traveled to the Bordens&#39; house<br/>
<br/>
***hmm.....why all the weapons??***<br/>
<br/>
 arriving around 7 am. Ludwig and Michael Borden argued for about 45 <br/>
minutes, at which time Michael Borden allegedly stated that Ludwig <br/>
was no longer allowed to see his daughter. Ludwig then allegedly shot <br/>
Michael Borden in the back and proceeded to shoot Cathryn Borden who <br/>
was sitting in the living room. Ludwig left the scene and then <br/>
returned in hopes to find Kara, who had run out of the house after <br/>
the first shooting in a frenzy. It was not long before Kara ran <br/>
towards his vehicle and according to Ludwig, asked him to drive as <br/>
far west as possible so they could marry and start a new life <br/>
together. <br/>
<br/>
***so after being freed from her horrible parents, she willingly left <br/>
with their murderer and said she wanted to get married and start a <br/>
new life. It sounds to me like she was the one doing the manipulating <br/>
here. But that is only my opinion, not the truth, not the real facts. <br/>
The truth and facts behind all this are not for me to judge, and no <br/>
one knows what really went on, except the actual people involved in <br/>
the murder.***</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1014843445">The news stories, unfortunately, won&#39;t give any of us insight on how to<br/>
unschool our children. It *does* give us a peek into how we&#39;d *not* like our<br/>
future relationships with our children to look/feel like.<br/>
I know, personally, two unschooled teenage couples whose ages reflect the<br/>
same gap as in this tragic story.<br/>
I did the tongue-clucking at first, too. Until I began to really pay<br/>
attention to how (in my own head and with some trusted RU friends) I was<br/>
putting on the Judges Robes in my thinking about these relationships.<br/>
So I decided to take off the robes & check it out for my own self. I was<br/>
lucky enough to be in ABQ with both couples, at the 2006 Live and Learn<br/>
Conference. The first couple, D & A, spend the most of their time together<br/>
making cookies with D&#39;s family, spending time with D&#39;s little sister and her<br/>
parents, even being invited along on family outings/trips. A is absolutely<br/>
welcome in their home. I understand D&#39;s dad did have a conversation with him<br/>
about his expectations for how his daughter is to be treated and the<br/>
consequences for behaving differently. A is still around :) I spoke with<br/>
them openly and honestly about my judgment and my gratitude for being given<br/>
an opportunity to (once again!) shift my perspective.<br/>
The second couple, JH & JB, I don&#39;t know as well so I took this opportunity<br/>
to get to know them better and ask them about their relationship. Actually,<br/>
before that JH&#39;s mother took me aside and told me she had refused her<br/>
daughter&#39;s request to see JB (with good cause, it was a long trip and a lot<br/>
of money) until my dd died and she realized she could very well be denying<br/>
her own daughter&#39;s last request. She found the money and JH was sent off to<br/>
spend some time with JB and his family -- across the country. At the talent<br/>
show, JB got up on stage and sang &quot;The Way You Look Tonight&quot; to his girl. It<br/>
was obvious to me how much he loves and cherishes JH. I went to her and<br/>
said, You are the luckiest girl in the room! and I meant it. I would give<br/>
anything to have someone look at, speak of, sing to my child in that same<br/>
way; heck, I&#39;d love for someone to do that for ME! It was all I wanted as a<br/>
teenager, and here I am right in the same space as these amazing people who<br/>
are in healthy relationships not only with one another, also with their<br/>
parents (both sets) and with others in their Tribe.<br/>
These are parents who love and cherish their kids. Who want the very best<br/>
possible for their kids. Their kids want to date someone *wonderful* who<br/>
happens to be 3+ years different in age. What can the family do as a *TEAM*<br/>
to make it a win/win/win/win/win situation? The two aforementioned families<br/>
are my examples for this situation. They represent the mentality and love I<br/>
want for my teens (when they get there!), heck for my kids at any age!<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
I don&#39;t know what it is about me that makes me open to other people&#39;s<br/>
kids... Mayhap it&#39;s my *never grow up* Gemini characteristics or it may just<br/>
very well be a symptom of being diana :::vbg::: It&#39;s not just teens, though<br/>
I like them fine. At Life is Good, I was surrounded by the toddlers-7 year<br/>
olds during the day and the teens at night. Nothing against adults, I talk<br/>
to them just fine, too :) Kids just seem to *get* unschooling more quickly<br/>
than their older schooled counterparts. They live it versus talking about<br/>
it. That is very appealing to me.To see it in action.<br/>
The news story doesn&#39;t give a generalization of how ALL kids will turn out<br/>
and it certainly doesn&#39;t reflect the plethora of possibilities we have as<br/>
unschoolers. I want to head towards the goal of the kind and gentle parents<br/>
I know who have enviable relationships with their kids. A totally different<br/>
path than outside of Unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
**D&#39;s mom here :o). I got the ok from Dagny and Andrew to write a bit about<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Dagny met Andrew at the first Peabody conference when she was almost 12 and<br/>
he was 15 1/2.  While Dagny developed a major crush on him pretty much the<br/>
minute she met him, Andrew had a girlfriend at the time.  So they became<br/>
friends, hanging out mostly in group situations and talking on the phone/IM<br/>
a LOT.  Eventually Andrew broke up with his girlfriend.  Dagny and Andrew<br/>
developed a really great friendship.  Then, 16 months ago, whatever magic it<br/>
is that happens happened for them.  Dagny was 13 1/4, Andrew had just turned<br/>
17, and they were in love.<br/>
<br/>
We had our moments of panic at first.  I think we&#39;d probably have had those<br/>
no matter how old she was the first time she fell in love.  She&#39;s our baby,<br/>
and we don&#39;t want her to be hurt or sad.  But we weren&#39;t going to let those<br/>
fears interfere in our relationships with her, or in her relationship with<br/>
Andrew.  Our focus became, &quot;What can we do to contribute to their having a<br/>
healthy relationship?&quot;   Anything that would cause them to feel they had to<br/>
sneak or lie to us would certainly not contribute to their having a healthy<br/>
relationship.  Anything that encouraged them to be open with us would.<br/>
<br/>
So, 16 months later:  Andrew&#39;s part of our family.  He has a key to our<br/>
house.  He stays here 3-4 nights a week.  He vacations with us.  He<br/>
house/dog sits for us.  He makes some mean chocolate chip cookies.  He&#39;s<br/>
kind to Dagny when she&#39;s grumpy.  He&#39;s gentle with Rowan. He&#39;s thoughtful<br/>
and helpful.  When my great-nephews come over he&#39;s a bit of a baby-hog.  His<br/>
laugh makes me laugh.  We talk about parenting and South Park and cars and<br/>
haircuts and learning and toys and cooking.  We argue the benefits of using<br/>
shortening in cookies. He and Dagny read to each other almost every night.<br/>
They jump on the trampoline, wave to strangers driving by, have nerf-gun<br/>
wars with Rowan and Jon, wander the aisles of Job Lot, cook, play video<br/>
games, sew, and garden.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s 14. He&#39;s 18. So what?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I understand D&#39;s dad did have a conversation with him about his<br/>

<br/>
**Just to clarify - Jon would only have done this jokingly, as anyone who&#39;s<br/>
met him would probably guess :o).  Anyway, Andrew&#39;s a 3rd degree blackbelt,<br/>
so Jon doesn&#39;t stand much of a chance &lt;G&gt;.   ~Rue<br/>

mature early are finding this hard to grasp!<br/>
<br/>
Dagny must have been 10 when my daughter, Kat, and I first met her at  <br/>
the first Live and Learn Conference. Dagny had organized through the  <br/>
Live and Learn Kids list &quot;Dumbledore&#39;s Army&quot; (I believe it was  <br/>
called.) She organized get togethers during the conference. She had  <br/>
this amazingly mature social sense. At 10. I had to check several  <br/>
times to make sure she really was only 10 because she seemed at least  <br/>
as old as my daughter (13 at the time) if not older ;-) And not that  <br/>
fake make up and sexy clothes &quot;maturity&quot; young schooled girls affect.  <br/>
Real social maturity.<br/>
<br/>
It really doesn&#39;t surprise me at all that she&#39;s mature enough for a  <br/>
boyfriend at 13.<br/>
<br/>
And yet at 15 (coming up on 16 next month) Kat isn&#39;t ready. Not only  <br/>
not ready, but knows she&#39;s not ready because she just isn&#39;t  <br/>
interested and doesn&#39;t feel there&#39;s anything wrong with that. I  <br/>
overheard her say to a friend that she didn&#39;t intend to date until  <br/>
she got to college. She&#39;s *very* similar to me. I too didn&#39;t date  <br/>
until college but I did feel odd because it seemed &quot;everyone&quot; had a  <br/>
boyfriend in high school. (My former best friend had a boyfriend in  <br/>
5th grade. (Former mostly because she matured a lot faster and we  <br/>
didn&#39;t have much in common anymore.))  Kat, on the other hand, knows  <br/>
she&#39;s perfectly normal.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s why arbitrary ages are meaningless.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s why knowing our children, developing a relationship that earns  <br/>
their trust, and being there to help them explore what they&#39;ve  <br/>
determined they&#39;re ready for is what makes this all work so wonderfully.<br/>
