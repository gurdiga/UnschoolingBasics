<div id="ygrps-yiv-2100792171">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t posted here in quite a while, though I read daily. My son<br/>
Tyler is almost 13, and this is our first year homeschooling. We&#39;ve<br/>
been enjoying the absolute freedom of deschooling, and learning how to<br/>
be together on a daily basis again.<br/>
<br/>
This morning he came to me and said that he&#39;s feeling concerned that<br/>
he&#39;s not doing enough for homeschooling and that he might need to go<br/>
back to school. Truthfully we haven&#39;t been &quot;doing&quot; much in schoolish<br/>
terms, which I explained to him. We&#39;ve been in a healing phase, and<br/>
working on letting go of thinking in school&#39;s terms. I asked what he<br/>
feels like he&#39;s missing, and he couldn&#39;t really articulate it, just<br/>
that he feels like he&#39;s not doing what he &quot;should&quot; be doing.<br/>
<br/>
We talked about the things that made him and all of us so unhappy<br/>
about school, and that going back he&#39;d need to realize that those<br/>
things would still be present, that he wouldn&#39;t have the power to<br/>
change school, only his own reactions to school. Learning/living at<br/>
home and in the world, he has the power to change many things. He can<br/>
start something new. He can stop something that isn&#39;t fulfilling. He<br/>
can try different things that he might not have the time or energy to<br/>
do if he had to spend so much time in the classrooms and doing<br/>
homework again.<br/>
<br/>
He seemed to understand what I said, but he&#39;s definitely getting to<br/>
the yearning phase. I want to help, but know from experience that any<br/>
suggestions I make are generally met with a negative response. We&#39;ve<br/>
signed up to get together with some other unschooling kids for 10<br/>
weeks in April and May to do some round table civics type discussions,<br/>
and to talk about creative ways math is a part of our lives. He&#39;s also<br/>
doing karate, but without much joy anymore.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m encouraging him to make a list (with me) of things he&#39;s interested<br/>
in, and the different ways we could go about getting involved, and I&#39;m<br/>
putting my own desires on the list as well. Other than that, I&#39;m<br/>
feeling a bit at a loss. Maybe it&#39;s just the winter blahs that&#39;s<br/>
making me feel stuck. Spring will hold all kinds of promise for new<br/>
growth.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m looking for some encouragement to keep on keeping on, and<br/>
maybe if anyone has any suggestions for how to help him without<br/>
pushing. My strewing so far isn&#39;t making any connections.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-313247060">HI Kelly!<br/>
  We are only into our 2nd year of unschooling here, ds 11 and 7.  I <br/>
feel after reading your post that your son is still letting go of <br/>
school thoughts.  That can take some time to do.  Being in school has <br/>
a way of getting ahold of our minds like that. Even after 2 years <br/>
there are times I am still dealing with it!<br/>
  Have you read The Teenage Liberation Handbook?  It sure made me <br/>
feel better about myself, as I left school as a junior. The book is <br/>
full of ideas for kids his age and older on what they are capable of, <br/>
things he may not of even thought of yet. <br/>
  Hang in there, spring is  almost here!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-44471127">Thank you Sydni,<br/>
<br/>
Yes, we have read that book--out loud together while making the<br/>
decision to homeschool. I was thinking yesterday that it might be a<br/>
good idea to revisit it!<br/>
<br/>
Last night I went to a workshop for homeschooling mom&#39;s called<br/>
*Inspire the Desire--how to avoid burnout* and it really helped me to<br/>
put the focus back on myself. It&#39;s important for me to not try to fix<br/>
everything for him, but make myself available. I have to keep persuing<br/>
my own passions/dreams and inviting him to join in. Take care of<br/>
myself. The pressure doesn&#39;t feel so high this morning.<br/>
<br/>
Spring is on the way right? No matter what the foot of fresh snow tells me? Hee.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!<br/>
<br/>
Kelly<br/>
