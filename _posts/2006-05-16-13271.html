<div id="ygrps-yiv-1584502245">You look SO good!! I picked up a copy of People today and there was your<br/>
beautiful family! I just couldn&#39;t get over it.  And you all look so, well,<br/>
normal.  You don&#39;t have any pink streaks, all the children (aside from<br/>
Trevor) have their normal color hair and Sierra isn&#39;t wearing one of her<br/>
homemade fashions.  I almost didn&#39;t recognize you all!  :-)  The article was<br/>
good.  I only skimmed through it quickly at the store, but will sit back and<br/>
absorb it later.  Congratulations for bringing unschooling to a wider<br/>
market!!<br/>
