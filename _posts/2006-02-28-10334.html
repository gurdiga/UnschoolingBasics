<br/>
So TRUE. I prefer to live without fear, including fear of food and<br/>
what it can do. My body tells me when it needs something, and I trust<br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing your very touching story about cancer. I&#39;m sure<br/>
it&#39;s been hard to read about Hannah. I appreciated hearing it though....<br/>

That&#39;s the feeling I&#39;ve been getting from these food discussions too. Thank you so much for sharing your story. I think healthy relationships and peace in our homes and our minds are as important, if not more important, than checking on our every bite of food.<br/>
