<div id="ygrps-yiv-1976271060">Ok.  I&#39;m just going to ask this question, because it&#39;s one of the barriers<br/>
for me that keeps me from totally understanding unschooling.  I get this...<br/>
<br/>
It also implies that when a child<br/>
asks a question they want some kind of &quot;learning&quot; to take place when<br/>
maybe they just feel like talking, or putzing about with you and don&#39;t<br/>
really care about the answer at all.<br/>
<br/>
When my children ask questions, I do think about why they are asking it, and<br/>
try to answer accordingly.  I think I do a pretty good job judging if they<br/>
are really curious about what they have asked, or if they are just trying to<br/>
make conversation.  And when I do misjudge, they let me know pretty quickly<br/>
and I either back off (if I&#39;m getting to deep) or get more detailed (if I<br/>
haven&#39;t quite answered what they wanted to know).<br/>
<br/>
But what I&#39;m really having a hard time fully grasping is this:<br/>
<br/>
The<br/>
first implies a parent has information the child needs and should get<br/>
at some point. It puts the parent in the seat of power and does not<br/>
allow for joint exploration much.<br/>
<br/>
Why is it wrong to admit that  parents have certain information that<br/>
children need?  I understand that adults don&#39;t give children nearly the<br/>
credit they deserve on knowing what they want to learn and when they want to<br/>
learn it.  I completely believe that children are naturally curious beings<br/>
who seek out knowledge and love to learn, and that they will continue to be<br/>
that way if they are given the constant freedom to do so.  And I also<br/>
understand that anyone learns, only when they are motivated to do so, or if<br/>
it has some meaning to them.<br/>
<br/>
But I know that I, as an adult, know some things that my children do not.<br/>
And while some of those things aren&#39;t important if, or when, my children<br/>
ever decide to learn them (like, Shakespeare, trigonometry, or the history<br/>
of Rome), aren&#39;t some things necessary for children to know *right now*?  What<br/>
I really don&#39;t understand is why it is wrong of me to impart my knowledge<br/>
when it comes to safety, health, or their ability to function (happily) in<br/>
society as an adult.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying that I know everything and my children do not.  For the most<br/>
part, my children choose what to learn about and we explore things together<br/>
(or they do it alone.)  They even teach me things (like how an engine<br/>
works!)  I don&#39;t sit them down and teach them lessons about these things.<br/>
It all happens spontaneously, as conversations or situations arise.  But in<br/>
these situations I do speak to them from experience, and I do feel like it<br/>
is my duty as a parent to tell them things like &quot;we don&#39;t run out into the<br/>
street without looking&quot; or &quot;when it&#39;s 102 degrees outside, you need to drink<br/>
water or you will get dehydrated.&quot;  I am an adult, experienced in life, and<br/>
there are just some things that I feel like would be neglectful if I did not<br/>
reveal to them.  How do you get around these things as an unschooler?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The poster was talking about school information here. The supposedly  <br/>
vital &quot;body of knowledge&quot; that educators impose on children (that  <br/>
most people forget 90% of ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Most parents worry how their kids will get all of that. When the tool  <br/>
of pushing that information into a child is removed for unschooling,  <br/>
they still feel that need and seek other avenues that feel  <br/>
&quot;unschoolish&quot;, like looking for teachable moments.<br/>
<br/>
The point is to work on eliminating the need to push in that body of  <br/>
knowledge rather than seek other ways to get it in.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooled kids *will* acquire a body of knowledge but it will be  <br/>
specific to who they are and what their interests are.*  In a rich  <br/>
environment they will absorb a lot of stuff that would have been  <br/>
pushed into them in school (and often promptly forgotten ;-) but it  <br/>
will be in a context that&#39;s meaningful to them. (Jokes for instance :-)<br/>
<br/>
* (And parents shouldn&#39;t worry if it looks like they know nothing but  <br/>
World of Warcraft right now! ;-) The unschooling parent needs to  <br/>
figure out what they are learning -- perhaps by playing, perhaps  <br/>
through conversations -- rather than look at what they aren&#39;t  <br/>
learning. It&#39;s the child&#39;s task to ease the parent&#39;s worry. It&#39;s up  <br/>
to the parent to work on eliminating their own worry.)<br/>

learning things out of context, like who invented the telephone when <br/>
you are no where near a telephone,but studying inventors because it&#39;s <br/>
in the curriculm. The other way, giving information about needing to <br/>
drink  when hot is probably being given in context,like on a hot day <br/>
not in the middle of winter. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t get the seat of power thing at all. Just because I have more <br/>
experience in some things doesn&#39;t give me more power, as there is <br/>
always somebody who knows things I don&#39;t. I know a lot about horses, <br/>
but not nearly as much about fishing as my 9 yr old does. If we have to <br/>
call an electrician to fix our light switch does that put him/her in <br/>
a &quot;seat of power?&quot; I suppose, since we pay the electrician for their <br/>
information it could be, but I&#39;ll bet I still know more about horses!<br/>

allow it? Is where the &quot;power&quot; comes in,to enforce them to learn what <br/>

What will happen when they find other ways to get there like bikes or <br/>

them into adulthood. I&#39;d rather they have fabulous memories of us<br/>

credibility. Give specifics that you can really back up with true  <br/>
information.<br/>
<br/>
How about letting them know that it is very tempting and easy to eat  <br/>
too many unhealthy foods at fast food places - that they make the  <br/>
servings way oversized, that they use a lot of fat and salt, which is  <br/>
probably fine for once in a while but not good on a regular basis.<br/>
<br/>
I eat VERY healthy, but I do eat fast food frequently. I eat a baked  <br/>
potato and a garden salad at Wendy&#39;s. I eat a piled-high with veggies  <br/>
sandwich or salad at Subway. I get a grilled chicken sandwich with no  <br/>
sauce and double lettuce and tomatoes. I get a plain hamburger, every  <br/>
once in a while, with double lettuce and double tomatoes. I don&#39;t eat  <br/>
fries or cheeseburgers or chicken nuggets or hash browns or milk  <br/>
shakes or soda or apple turnovers or onion rings. I get a nonfat latte  <br/>
at Starbucks with one of those little bags of almonds that they have  <br/>
at the register. I get a whole wheat bagel and low-fat cream cheese. I  <br/>
get a grilled veggie bare-bowl burrito with no cheese and extra fresh  <br/>
salsa at Baja Fresh. I get a Panda Bowl with mandarin chicken on  <br/>
veggies (no noodles) at Panda Express. I LOVE Genghis Khan - the  <br/>
mongolian barbeque place in many malls - I pile on the veggies with  <br/>
just a little smidgen of lean chicken and no noodles.<br/>
<br/>
I could go on - I eat fast food very often, but I am very picky about  <br/>
what I choose to eat.<br/>

my children.  Not that I own them, but that I love them.  I care for their<br/>

are children and I am an adult.  They know that french fries taste good.<br/>
They don&#39;t know that they cause cancer and heart disease.  And even if they<br/>

It&#39;s one thing to say nicely, that we&#39;re not going to McDonalds because it&#39;s<br/>
not a healthy place to eat.  It&#39;s quite another to say their idea is crap.<br/>
Just because you say no, does that really mean a child thinks his idea is<br/>
crap?  When I want to go out to eat, and my husband says, &quot;No,&quot; I don&#39;t<br/>
assume he thinks my idea stinks.  Usually there is a good reason why he<br/>
doesn&#39;t want to go there.  We don&#39;t say no often, so once in awhile can&#39;t be<br/>
bad.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But<br/>
is there really a risk that if you are offering lots of healthy<br/>
choices and trusting them, that McDonald&#39;s will somehow ruin their<br/>
health?<br/>
I believe so.  I mean, i understand that McDonald&#39;s, once in awhile, will<br/>
not destroy your health if you generally make healthy food choices.  But<br/>
what about helping children develop healthy habits?  If I took my children<br/>
out to fast food every time they asked, until they were developmentally<br/>
ready to resist good-tasting food because of the health risks, that would be<br/>
more than just a few hamburgers.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a certified health nut and I take my child to McDonald&#39;s when they<br/>
ask.<br/>
But how often do they ask?  If they asked every day, would you take them<br/>
there?  Our kids hardly ever asked to go to fast food restaurants before we<br/>
moved last summer.  But when we were between houses for 3 months, we ate out<br/>
almost every night.  Since then, our children have been asking to eat fast<br/>
food almost every time we pass one.  They think it&#39;s normal now.  And the<br/>
problem is that fast food tastes good.  If you don&#39;t know (or think about)<br/>
what&#39;s in it, then it&#39;s much yummier than fish and rice for dinner.<br/>

about a formula for teaching/learning.  There are no rules to follow.  It is<br/>
about a way of thinking.  I think someone here (was it you, Joyce?) said<br/>
that it is more about learning how to give each of your children what THEY<br/>
need to  learn and grow.  Like when my baby cries, I know what she needs,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2133357434">~!~Here&#39;s a question: If your child wanted to smoke cigarettes, would<br/>
you allow that?~~<br/>
<br/>
Do you believe that by not allowing something, it will actually keep<br/>
your child from doing it? Good luck with that.<br/>
<br/>
You can keep your children from McDonald&#39;s most of the time right now,<br/>
because they&#39;re young I assume. Anyone with older kids or teens knows<br/>
full well that a child will do the things they really desire as soon<br/>
as they get away from a controlling parent. You&#39;re making that food<br/>
seem really mystical and desirable.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the cigarette issue, I knew when my oldest child tried a<br/>
cigarette. He told me all about it and about the situation he&#39;d been<br/>
in that caused him to try it. We talked about how it felt and what he<br/>
thought. I didn&#39;t judge his choice as bad or good. We talked. I get<br/>
such honesty from him at 18...about issues I would NEVER have shared<br/>
with my parents.<br/>
<br/>
I knew when he and his girlfriend made a conscious choice to have sex.<br/>
Forbidding sex or cigarettes or McDonalds is laughable really. Better<br/>
to trust that my children need to explore certain foods or ideas WITH<br/>
me alongside, than to forbid it and let them explore all alone later<br/>
in life.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not true that McDonalds causes cancer and if you tell them that<br/>
they will meet people who eat those foods and are the epitome of<br/>
health. Then what? Your credibility is shot. Cancer is partially<br/>
genetic and partically lifestyle induced. A lifestyle of health, with<br/>
some McDonald&#39;s thrown in is not going to harm most any average person.<br/>
<br/>
Your child will eat fries at some point, I could about bet. If they<br/>
can&#39;t trust you to not judge their desire for fries, how will they<br/>
trust you with the big issues like sex, drugs, tattoos etc???<br/>
<br/>
If I had a craving for some ice cream and my dh informed me it was bad<br/>
and told me &quot;no&quot;, it would create a situation in which he was in<br/>
power. I don&#39;t want to be in a seat of power with my children, I<br/>
prefer an environment where we are all learning together.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, if you came to my home you&#39;d hear a lot of talk about<br/>
fossil fuels and food shortages and growing healthy foods. We have<br/>
bees, we&#39;re growing a huge garden and these issues are part of our<br/>
lives. Nobody gets some whopping &quot;that&#39;s not healthy&quot; judgement when<br/>
they want other foods though. In doing that, they trust me with<br/>
conversations they might not otherwise trust me with. They&#39;re also<br/>
very balanced individuals because they explore all sorts of foods and<br/>
the idea of what THEIR own body needs vs. another person. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-512922104">My kids have decided to avoid fast foods because of how it makes them <br/>
feel.  They feel heavy or downright sick when they eat them.  None of <br/>
them now choose fast foods, but it was their decision.  They now choose <br/>
to go somewhere with salads or good bread and cheese and veggies.  My <br/>
youngest and decided to become a vegetarian, and it was because she <br/>
loves animals so much.  She has influenced all of us to move in that <br/>
direction.  She recently told us that eating meat also influences the <br/>
global environment.  My kids have been a great influence on me!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1574759012">Hi Kim-<br/>
<br/>
Control over food was the hardest thing for me to let go of- it was a <br/>
very emotional process for me. My son has asthma which when he was <br/>
younger was markedly improved by avoiding gluten and refined foods in <br/>
general. The stakes are relatively high. However- control is not <br/>
something I truly have over him, and that became apparent. What really <br/>
hit me at one point is that even if somehow I managed to maintain <br/>
control over his diet when he lived at home(which I couldn&#39;t) - then he <br/>
would at one point leave home and begin binging on all the forbidden <br/>
foods and then really have some problems when I wasn&#39;t there to help <br/>
him. I much prefer to have him go through whatever process of learning <br/>
about how to maintain his own health- through whatever &quot;mistakes&quot; he <br/>
needs to make while he lives at home then when he is miles away. While I <br/>
was controlling his diet he was not learning to eat &quot;well&quot;- he was <br/>
learning that I was mean and controlling- that is all he could see.<br/>
<br/>
Also- it become apparent that any type of control I attempted to have <br/>
over him was hurting our relationship. This really became apparent as he <br/>
reached the pre-teen years. Any influence I had would only come through <br/>
putting our relationship first.  I only wish I had discovered this way <br/>
of parenting long ago. I give him information WHEN he is open to it- <br/>
such as when he asks- Mom- why do you get sick less than I do? Or why do <br/>
you buy this food instead of that food? He said recently that he prefers <br/>
real food to junk food- because it tastes better.<br/>
<br/>
I know this can feel like a  huge  step in trusting your children- but <br/>
like anything else- people will either learn it or not learn it- and <br/>
forcing or prohibiting isn&#39;t helping them learn- it interferes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1845144211">Kim,<br/>
<br/>
I am new to Unschooling and like you was (and sometimes still) have<br/>
concerns and problems with the philosophy, or rather application of<br/>
the philosophy in a particular situation.  Early on food was a big<br/>
bugaboo for me.  I was overweight.  Very.  I&#39;m 5&#39;2&quot; and at my heaviest<br/>
I weighed 235lbs.  I&#39;ve lost 100 lbs in 2 yrs.  I am also chronically<br/>
ill (Systemic Lupus, Fibromyalgia and Sjogren&#39;s Syndrome.)  So, I was<br/>
really sensitive to the idea that my boys might get fat.  And my 11 yr<br/>
old is getting pudgy.  Anyway, I had this same pre-learning tantrum<br/>
about foods and just letting them eat whatever.  But Ren is right.  If<br/>
you control each and every mouthful of food you provide to your kids,<br/>
they will eat what they want when they can.  So I let it go.  It was<br/>
not easy.  I smiled and offered them the foods they wanted (although<br/>
not going out for fast food often because now we are talking going out<br/>
and buying and that ran into some real life issues that we had to deal<br/>
with.)  But I&#39;d provide Cheese Its and other such &quot;crap&quot; and smile,<br/>
but in my head I&#39;d be screaming &quot;YOU ARE GOING TO GET SO FAT!!!&quot;<br/>
Because as I mentioned before, being fat is my bugaboo.  But I did<br/>
this in my head and was careful not to pass it along.  Despite some<br/>
assertions that kids really know what you are thinking I think if you<br/>
are careful you can think things and your kids will not know.  And<br/>
they didn&#39;t.  (That&#39;s how I got them to eat yogurt as babies, with a<br/>
smile and &quot;yummy!&quot; while inside I was gagging on the stench.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, there are a few shows on TV that we enjoy.  One is called &quot;You<br/>
Are What You Eat&quot; it&#39;s on BBC America.  And it shows bad diets and<br/>
what they do to people and what being on an 8 week detox diet can do<br/>
for folks.  We all watched it.  I didn&#39;t make them watch it.  And I<br/>
certainly NEVER said &quot;SEE!!! This will be YOU if you don&#39;t change your<br/>
bad ways!&quot;  We just watched it because it was entertaining.  But they<br/>
were listening.  And another show, the name escapes me is about foods<br/>
and our bodies and how to do a better job of feeding them.  The Dr who<br/>
is on the show is Dr Oz anyway, we learned on that show how bad<br/>
hydrogenated oils are for you and what they do to your liver.  Again,<br/>
I didn&#39;t lecture and I didn&#39;t say &quot;You are killing yourself.&quot;  I just<br/>
talked about this new information actually WE talked about it.  It was<br/>
something we didn&#39;t know.  My husband and I (my husband is a horrible<br/>
eater BTW) decided no hydrogenated oils for us.  Now the kids are kind<br/>
of caught up in that because if I don&#39;t buy them they can&#39;t have them.<br/>
 But they got into reading labels too.  Foods they would choose<br/>
normally, they would choose different alternatives without the<br/>
hydrogenated oils.  But I didn&#39;t insist.  They came to the decision on<br/>
their own.  And yes, from time to time we ALL eat hydrogenated oils if<br/>
we are out or there is some item we want.  But overall we don&#39;t eat<br/>
them anymore.  Instead of buying cookies that are generally LOADED<br/>
with them (and high fructose corn syrup which we also avoid) I make<br/>
cookies at home.  So it&#39;s not no cookies...it&#39;s how can we make<br/>
cookies healthier?<br/>
<br/>
Also I do not have artificial sweeteners here.  Because of my health<br/>
issues, they all make my pain worse.  I have told the boys (not Morgan<br/>
she&#39;s just 3 and eats like a Chinese person so it&#39;s not an issue for<br/>
her right now) that I&#39;d rather they try to avoid artificial sweeteners<br/>
and that sugar isn&#39;t bad.  It&#39;s better if you want something sweet to<br/>
eat real sugar than chemical laden things.  But I don&#39;t insist.  I<br/>
guide.  When we are at the store, if one of them picks up something<br/>
&quot;Light&quot; because they believe it&#39;s a better food choice we read the<br/>
label and see what&#39;s in it.  They decide then if they want it anyway<br/>
or not.  I don&#39;t partake of it because *I* don&#39;t want to.  They know<br/>
that.  But they are welcome to have it.  We&#39;ve talked about how it<br/>
makes me feel and why I eye those products skeptically.  But that&#39;s<br/>
not beating them over the head with it.  That&#39;s just sharing<br/>
information and there is a difference.  AND it&#39;s not scare tactics.  I<br/>
have anecdotal evidence from my own body that backs me up that when<br/>
*I* drink or eat artificial sweeteners *I* am in more pain.  The boys<br/>
can ingest them with no issues.  If they choose to do so that&#39;s fine.<br/>
I certainly have not said things I couldn&#39;t back up like &quot;Eating<br/>
french fries causes cancer!&quot;  Because there isn&#39;t any real evidence to<br/>
back that up.  My kids are smart and they know what studies are<br/>
supposed to show and what a representative sample is.  They know a<br/>
&quot;study&quot; of 5 people that draws large conclusions is no study.<br/>
<br/>
We also know someone who was in perfect health.  Jogged 6 miles a day,<br/>
thin, beautiful, vegan.  Didn&#39;t smoke, didn&#39;t drink, and found liver<br/>
cancer and was dead 8 weeks later.  Their grandfather was a smoker and<br/>
got lung cancer and died from it.  So they have seen both sides.  They<br/>
ask questions and I give them the factual information I have but I<br/>
also give them opinion but I tell them it&#39;s such.  &quot;I think smoking is<br/>
gross.  Other people feel differently.&quot;  That is a statement of<br/>
opinion and fact.  It is a fact that it is my opinion that smoking is<br/>
gross.  It is fact that other people feel differently.  They will have<br/>
to decide for themselves what they want to do.  But keeping it open<br/>
for us to discuss these issues makes it less likely they will try it.<br/>
And as far as foods go...sometimes when we are out we do the fast food<br/>
thing.  Because food shouldn&#39;t be punishment or reward.  Food is food.<br/>
 Some foods taste better than others.  We will sometimes eat something<br/>
that is *total crap* like the deep fried onions some places serve and<br/>
while eating it we will talk about how bad it is for us but how very<br/>
good it tastes.  And more often than not it&#39;s the boys who bring it<br/>
up.  It&#39;s OK to eat crap every now and again, and when we are all<br/>
stuffing our faces with it and smiling and laughing it&#39;s so much<br/>
better than us sitting around a table and choking down something I<br/>
personally find disgusting...fish...with everyone wishing they could<br/>
be eating something different.<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is that there is a larger picture<br/>
available and when I was looking at the very small picture (fat vs<br/>
thin) I was missing the rest of the picture and passing along my food<br/>
issues even though I thought I wasn&#39;t.  You will do what you can do<br/>
with this philosophy in the time frame that it works for you.  I<br/>
fought against it in the beginning because I was looking at it as all<br/>
or nothing.  If I can&#39;t do it all I might as well do nothing.  But<br/>
when I let that go, I applied it where I could and made a conscious<br/>
effort to let it take hold in other areas as well.  There are still<br/>
things I do say &quot;no&quot; to.  I just told Morgan &quot;No throwing&quot; when she<br/>
hurled a wooden block in the direction of the TV.  There is a &quot;No<br/>
Throwing&quot; rule in the living room for hard things.  But soft things<br/>
are OK.  So I took the block and set it gently on the floor and threw<br/>
a soft &quot;OK to throw&quot; item at her.  She laughed and picked it up and is<br/>
throwing it around as we speak.  Likely I could have phrased it<br/>
better.  But it&#39;s better than I would have done 9 yrs ago.  Come to<br/>
this as you can in the ways you can and it will eventually impose<br/>
itself on other areas of your life.  You will see it work in one area<br/>
and you will not be able to avoid seeing how it would work in another.<br/>
 At least that&#39;s how I see it.  But I haven&#39;t been at this very long,<br/>
just about a year.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-916320016"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;He said recently that he prefers real food to junk food- because it<br/>
 </span></blockquote>tastes better<br/>
We&#39;re having lasagna tomorrow - DH&#39;s &quot;world famous&quot; (lol) homemade<br/>
lasagna - he makes the whole wheat herbed noodles from scratch! We<br/>
hadn&#39;t had it in a while and DS (almost 10) mentioned last week that we<br/>
hadn&#39;t had homemade pasta in a while and that it tastes better than the<br/>
store kind. Okay, so let&#39;s plan for it soon - and we did. <br/>
<br/>
DS has been &quot;in on&quot; discussions that DH and I have about our various<br/>
health situations (he&#39;s got high blood pressure, I was diagnosed with<br/>
type 2 diabetes a year ago, so carbs, fats, and sodium are all up for<br/>
discussion) - we don&#39;t &quot;lecture&quot; him but when DH and I are talking, DS<br/>
might ask a question like &quot;what is hydrogenated?&quot; Actually, though, some<br/>
of the best information on nutrition has come from watching Good Eats (I<br/>
loved when Alton Brown explained the differences between<br/>
monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and saturated fat using a little<br/>
trolley car) and talking about what we&#39;re seeing/hearing. DS has the<br/>
freedom to choose what and when and how much he eats (we just never<br/>
changed that from when he was an infant and nursed on demand, for<br/>
however long he wanted - the eat what, when, how much idea of free<br/>
nursing as applied to solid foods). We&#39;ll answer questions and provide<br/>
information and modelling (he&#39;s more likely to check a label than I am!)<br/>
- he can eat just one potato chip if that&#39;s all he wants BECAUSE he<br/>
knows he can have 20 if he wants or he can wait until later and have<br/>
more. There&#39;s a sense of abundance even when we&#39;re out of something and<br/>
need to wait until the next paycheck/grocery trip. DH and I have learned<br/>
so much about healthy eating by watching our never food regulated DS -<br/>
he can just as easily eat half a doughnut, eat some homemade bread and<br/>
soup, then eat the rest of the doughnut as eat the whole doughnut first<br/>
simply because he knows that there&#39;s no &quot;deadline&quot; to get it done -<br/>
it&#39;ll still be there and available later if he chooses to wait. He often<br/>
gets a whopper jr (no pickles) but he knows that DH and I won&#39;t get that<br/>
(I&#39;ll get a salad or a veggie burger if we&#39;re there) and he&#39;s coming to<br/>
prefer going to places like Subway where he can get more veggies, less<br/>
meat (we&#39;re not vegetarian, we&#39;re more what I&#39;d call plant-based<br/>
omnivores - we don&#39;t generally buy meats for home use but if we&#39;re out<br/>
we get whatever we want in that location). What&#39;s really humorous is<br/>
when he piles a plate with steamed broccoli or avocado slices and people<br/>
wonder how we &#39;get him&#39; to eat that (he generally opts for broccoli over<br/>
fries whenever possible at restaurants) - it&#39;s really easy: don&#39;t make<br/>
him do it! He&#39;s got an interesting concept about things like halloween<br/>
candy and desserts and such: if you make kids eat all their dinner in<br/>
order to get what they want (a sweet), then they&#39;ll override their body<br/>
saying it&#39;s full in order to eat the sweet because they&#39;ve &#39;earned&#39; it.<br/>
He&#39;s developed this idea in conversation with us and watching his<br/>
younger cousin be told &quot;you have to eat x or no y&quot; (you have to eat this<br/>
serving of mac & cheese before you eat that slice of pumpkin pie for<br/>
instance...gee, they&#39;re not all that different when you get right down<br/>
to it). <br/>

going to our local McDonald&#39;s is that my children have developed a very <br/>

 </span></blockquote>First, there is no real proof that french fries cause cancer or <br/>
heart disease. We&#39;ve been exploring this idea of proof with the <br/>
violent video game thread about whether or not scientific studies <br/>
actually prove causation. Most times they do not. What they may show <br/>
is correlation, which just means that one thing appears to be <br/>
strongly associated with the other. However, especially when <br/>
studying humans and human behavior, there is absolutely no way to <br/>
exclude all other variables to make it possible to prove true <br/>
causation. So, you can&#39;t *know* that french fries cause cancer or <br/>
heart disease. You can *believe* that they do and that&#39;s your <br/>
choice. <br/>
<br/>
Interesting that you should bring up the cigarette smoking because I <br/>
have had to deal with just this situation. My oldest son, who is now <br/>
17, does smoke. I could not stop him no matter how much I wanted to. <br/>
I&#39;m not sure exactly when he started but I think it was around 13 or <br/>
14. He likes to tell me of a time when I found a pack of his <br/>
cigarettes and took all of them out and broke them and threw them <br/>
away.  That didn&#39;t stop him from smoking. It only made him very <br/>
angry at me. I don&#39;t remember doing this at all but I&#39;m sure I did <br/>
since he remembers it so vividly. <br/>
<br/>
I have come to realize that all I can do is talk to him about my <br/>
concerns for him, including how difficult it is to quit. I have <br/>
first hand knowledge of that since I smoked cigarettes for years and <br/>
it took me years to quit. Do I think that at 13 or even 17 he can <br/>
completely understand the possible long term effects of smoking? <br/>
Probably not. I cannot control what he does, though. I asked him not <br/>
to smoke in the house for the health and safety of the rest of us. <br/>
Most of the time he respected that. I didn&#39;t give him a hard time <br/>
about smoking on my front porch. I even provided him with an ash <br/>
tray because *I* did not want cigarette butts all over my front <br/>
lawn. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s his life, his body, his health, his choice. <br/>

parents had no idea what she was doing. She lied to them all the <br/>
time. Every once in a while she would get caught breaking a rule and <br/>
she would be grounded for months at a time. It was really crazy. It <br/>
never stopped her from doing those things. She would just figure out <br/>
other ways to trick her parents. I couldn&#39;t help but think what a <br/>
sad situation for her parents. They have no idea who thier daughter <br/>
is. I don&#39;t want that kind of relationship with my children.<br/>
<br/>
Now I apply these principles to my relationship with my 4 year old. <br/>
If he asks for McDonalds, sometimes we go and sometimes we don&#39;t. It <br/>
depends on several factors. I provide plenty of healthy food for him <br/>
at home that he enjoys as well. Sometimes he&#39;d prefer fish and rice <br/>
rather than a cheeseburger Happy Meal. We ate out the other night <br/>
and a lady commented on how impressed she was that he asked for and <br/>
ate a salad. There was no need to try to force or coerce him into <br/>
eating it. For dessert he wanted ice cream (not organic, probably <br/>
not even real ice cream) and carrot cake, off which he just ate the <br/>
frosting. I think he discovered he doesn&#39;t like carrot cake. He <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have been able to determine that for himself if I hadn&#39;t <br/>
let him have that 2nd dessert.<br/>

Food is food. Some food is better for us than other foods, sure. But<br/>
is there really a risk that if you are offering lots of healthy<br/>
choices and trusting them, that McDonald&#39;s will somehow ruin their<br/>
health? Nah.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I can remember taking my kids to McDonalds for winter playdates because they<br/>
had an indoor playground.  We usually ate there as well as played and  I<br/>
also brought apples and carrots because I knew those were things my kids<br/>
liked.  I would bring enough apples for all the kids we met up with and just<br/>
put them on the table.  I don&#39;t remember ever going home with extra apples.<br/>
The kids would eat those along with or instead of their other food.   They<br/>
liked their fries and stuff and they liked their apples and we played and<br/>
had fun for hours.   <br/>

It makes sense. When you are stressed your immune system doesn&#39;t function as well, so it wouldn&#39;t be a hard stretch to imagine that your digestive system might not function as well either. I can&#39;t find the book, or the study. Sigh... Anyhow, if you eat something happily you are better able to derive nutrients from it than if you eat it under duress. <br/>

<br/>
 If you believe that fast food is unhealthy then I think it&#39;s fine to <br/>
say so.People have a lot beliefs that cannot be scientifically proven <br/>
one way or another. Just look at the vaccine issue for an example. I <br/>
do not think it is wrong to make a statement like that. It is wrong <br/>
to force your child to agree with you.<br/>
<br/>
 It is true you can go to MC Donalds and order the salad. You can get <br/>
healthy food at fast food places. In that sense, I could be very <br/>
exacting and say &quot;some fast food is bad for you, but the salad is OK&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 Personally, I believe that it is not the food itself as much as your <br/>
emotional well being. We do go to Mc Donalds,drink soda,eat lots of <br/>
sweets.I think if you are worrying that a food is unhealthy you are <br/>
getting stressed while eating it and the stress itself is more <br/>
unhealthy than the food. A twinkie eaten with joy is just fine.<br/>
 There was a woman in our newspaper who was 102. When asked what her <br/>
secret was she said wonderbread and tea. Yet in any magazine you can <br/>
read about the dangers of salt,hydrogenated oils, white bread and <br/>
sugar. Science itself looses credibility when they say things <br/>
like &quot;eggs are bad for you&quot; then a few years later ...&quot;eggs are good <br/>
for you&quot;<br/>

&gt; them<br/>
&gt; there? Our kids hardly ever asked to go to fast food restaurants  <br/>
&gt; before we<br/>
&gt; moved last summer. But when we were between houses for 3 months, we  <br/>
&gt; ate out<br/>
&gt; almost every night. Since then, our children have been asking to eat  <br/>
&gt; fast<br/>
&gt; food almost every time we pass one. They think it&#39;s normal now. And  <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; problem is that fast food tastes good. If you don&#39;t know (or think  <br/>
&gt; about)<br/>
&gt; what&#39;s in it, then it&#39;s much yummier than fish and rice for dinner.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You really can make food that is healthy, at home, that is WAY better  <br/>
than fast food - and I mean that kids like better, not JUST healthier.  <br/>
Maybe fish and rice just aren&#39;t foods your kids enjoy? You can make  <br/>
fast-food like foods at home, even. Instead of fast-food french fries,  <br/>
make your own. Let the kids choose different seasonings to try on  <br/>
them. Bake them instead of frying them.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could take it as a challenge - come up with a set of foods  <br/>
that the kids choose over a stop at a fast food place.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if they&#39;re wanting to stop when you&#39;re driving by, that might be  <br/>
a sign that you&#39;ve got somewhat hungry kids in the car - take more  <br/>
snacks along with you.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of forbidding or restricting fast food - make the alternatives  <br/>
much more enticing. Help them KNOW that it is possible to fix healthy  <br/>
foods that are even better than fast food.<br/>
<br/>
It works. I have a 17 yo, 20 yo, and 23 yo -- they could eat all the  <br/>
fast food they want, they have their own money and are out on their  <br/>
own quite often. They take food with them a lot. Yesterday my 17 yo  <br/>
needed to buy some lunch when she was out and she stopped at a 7-11  <br/>
and bought bananas and peanut butter. Kind of a strange lunch? Still -  <br/>
healthy enough. She could have had pizza or a hamburger and fries.  <br/>
Even when they EAT fast food, they choose the healthiest food they  <br/>
can. They LIKE the feeling of being healthy, and wholesome foods are  <br/>
what appeals most to them. They didn&#39;t get this habit from me  <br/>
restricting them. They got it by being used to making their own  <br/>
choices, with me providing lots of good options to choose from.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes they would say, &quot;We&#39;re hungry, we want to stop at ......&quot;  <br/>
Then I&#39;d say, &quot;We could do that. Or we could go home and eat  <br/>
that ..... that we made yesterday.&quot;  Fill in with some yummy thing  <br/>
that we have at home that I know they&#39;d really like.  You might have  <br/>
to work at having those cool choices available at home, but it&#39;ll be  <br/>
habit after a while.<br/>
<br/>
You sound kind of like you think all the healthy choices are  <br/>
automatically less appealing to the kids -- fish and rice sounds dull.  <br/>
But breakfast cookies or homemade bread and peanut butter or homemade  <br/>
granola or trail mix? We make brown basmati rice with cherries in it -  <br/>
that&#39;s a big favorite. Most kids have a few veggies they really like.  <br/>
Most like to dip some kind of veggie in something like ranch dressing.  <br/>
Experiment with healthy dips! We do a LOT of plain fat-free yogurt  <br/>
with cucumber very finely chopped up in it along with dried mint or  <br/>
dried dill. Sometimes we put some raisins in it. Sometimes we put  <br/>
chopped walnuts in it. This makes a great dip for toasted whole wheat  <br/>
pita bread or for those baby carrots or sticks of jicama or cucumber  <br/>
sticks. Sliced apples are a big favorite - sprinkled with cinnamon -  <br/>
cold or warmed up. I often put a handful of multi-grain Cheerios into  <br/>
a bowl with some fat-free flavored yogurt. Because we always have  <br/>
plain fat-free yogurt in the fridge, I often flavor it myself with all  <br/>
kinds of things that people might think are strange, but they&#39;re fun -  <br/>
cinnamon, vanilla, lemon zest, cocoa powder, peanut butter, garlic,  <br/>
and on and on. If you&#39;re making a flavor that you want sweet - you can  <br/>
add a little honey.<br/>
<br/>
So - I guess what I&#39;m saying is that instead of restricting, focus on  <br/>
being creative and put the effort into providing child-friendly  <br/>
healthy and fun food. Also, kids often don&#39;t really care about &quot;meals&quot;  <br/>
- they enjoy grazing throughout the day. So they may not be very  <br/>
hungry for dinner, but snacking like that&#39;s very healthy and let&#39;s you  <br/>
focus your mealtime more on what you and your spouse might enjoy  <br/>
without worrying whether the kids are getting the nutrition they need.<br/>
<br/>
You might enjoy reading, &quot;In Defense of Food,&quot; by Michael Pollan  <br/>
(author of the Omnivore&#39;s Dilemma). It is about how we&#39;ve stopped  <br/>
thinking of food as &quot;food&quot; and think of it as nutrients, instead.  <br/>
Really thought-provoking - easy reading (easier than The Omnivore&#39;s  <br/>
Dilemma which I found kind of boring to get through, even though I  <br/>
liked what he had to say).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Right. My kids are old now and they know a whole lot about nutrition.  <br/>
A LOT. I wasn&#39;t saying to lecture little kids. I was saying that  <br/>
telling them fast food is unhealthy is really overstating it and you  <br/>
lose your credibility if you&#39;re not scrupulously honest with your  <br/>
kids. Truth: fast food places tend to offer much-too-large servings,  <br/>
too much salt, and too much fat.  Truth: you can eat there and be  <br/>
healthy, but we adults tend to eat what we&#39;re served so we overeat and  <br/>
consume a lot of salt and fat. (But are your kids overeating or do  <br/>
they eat until they&#39;re full and stop.) Truth: fast food places offer  <br/>
more and more healthy alternatives, especially those aimed at kids, so  <br/>
that&#39;s great! Truth: you don&#39;t need to balance your nutrition for  <br/>
every meal. Fast food tends to be short ofn fruits and veggies, so  <br/>
have more of those at other times. Truth: eating fast food won&#39;t kill  <br/>
you or make you sick unless you choose it really a lot, and make poor  <br/>
fast-food choices, over years. In fact, turns out that fat, even  <br/>
saturated fat, may not EVER have been the big problem we&#39;ve all been  <br/>
taught it was. Transfats, partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, seem  <br/>
to be a far more guilty culprit and, these days, are disappearing even  <br/>
from fast food. Salt - probably not a problem for children, more for  <br/>
adults prone to high blood pressure.<br/>
<br/>
So - take a fresh look at fast food maybe with a more open mind.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m pretty sure Ren&#39;s kids are picking up on what is more or less  <br/>
healthy because she, herself, is interested in that and models healthy  <br/>
eating. So do I. I don&#39;t have to lecture the kids, I don&#39;t have to  <br/>
make any special effort to tell them. It comes up naturally and they  <br/>
learn, by making their own choices, what is healthy for themselves.<br/>

Tonight David and I had a shrimp curry, Simon had a bean and cheese burrito and Linnaea and her friend and baked potatoes with baked beans. The bean and cheese burrito was easy, just thrown together from leftovers. Baked potatoes and baked beans are easy as well. The shrimp curry is David&#39;s doing, so it wasn&#39;t a lot more work for me than a normal meal, nor for David, really. Dinner for them is less of a focus than it is for David or I. They eat when they are hungry throughout the day. I like having at least one clear meal in a day. And I enjoy making it. But I don&#39;t need them to eat it. I only offer it as a gift. <br/>
