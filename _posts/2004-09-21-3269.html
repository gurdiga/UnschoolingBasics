<div id="ygrps-yiv-1558967334">Yesterday I picked my nephews up from school so they could spend the <br/>
evening with me. I couldn&#39;t check them out until 20 minutes before <br/>
the other kids got out because my sister &quot;didn&#39;t want them to miss <br/>
anything.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I had a great evening with the boys and when it was time for me to <br/>
take them home so they could take their baths at 7:30 and be in bed <br/>
for 8 (god, I hate rigidity) they both cried and said they wanted to <br/>
stay with me. We hadn&#39;t done anything special; we just chilled and <br/>
each one did as they pleased the whole time with no one ordering <br/>
them around or correcting them.<br/>
<br/>
We got an icecream (even one for my dog, Maelu) on the way home and <br/>
I cranked the rap music up(their dad doesn&#39;t allow it in &quot;his&quot; home) <br/>
and we rolled the windows down. In other words, we were being cool! <br/>
Their spirits were up again until we pulled in their driveway.<br/>
<br/>
Their dad was outside watering his rose garden and the boys got out <br/>
and their attitudes immediately went glum. They moped down the drive <br/>
and didn&#39;t look back. I said, &quot;Thank you for spending the evening <br/>
with me guys. I really enjoyed the company.&quot; I immediately regretted <br/>
saying anything because their dad then forced them to stop, turn <br/>
around and tell me thank you. He then tried to force them to hug me. <br/>
I told him that we had hugged all evening and their tears upon <br/>
leaving my house were all I needed to know they appreciated being <br/>
with me. <br/>
<br/>
He just shook his head and smirked and said, &quot;You&#39;ll never <br/>
understand.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
AGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH <br/>
<br/>
Nope, I certainly won&#39;t. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1245280788">Valerie,<br/>
  I was wondering if your sister& brother-in-law have shared their feelings <br/>
about how you raised Laurie? It sounds like they have very different ideas.<br/>
 You mention that they are rigid. Is it their religion that may be directing<br/>
them? Or how they were raised? Possibly their friends?Peer pressure can<br/>
really be a hard thing to let go of.<br/>
  Sounds like you all had a great time.Can I come and spend the evening with<br/>
you?LOL<br/>

(please, thank you, etc.) and it sucked.  Even if I actually felt <br/>
gratitude I felt like crap by being forced to say it against my will <br/>
rather than with sincerity.  Yuck yuck yuck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1136640451">As I read your post Tracy.....I remembered how it felt when I was a kid. I<br/>
did have those feelings at times. Hugging a relative I hardly knew and<br/>
really didn&#39;t want to or saying sorry when I wasn&#39;t. Mostly the expected <br/>
thank you&quot;. I was going to say it but apparently not soon enough. Took the<br/>
joy out of it.At other times it reminded me to if  I forgot and I felt<br/>
embarrased at forgetting.<br/>
  I&#39;m guilty of saying it to my kids....kind of knee jerk I think. It is<br/>
expected and seems to slip out. I hope to make a change and allow my kids to<br/>
speak for themselves...or not. I remember saying &quot; what do you say&quot; when one<br/>
of mine was given something. I was feeling pressured (probably from myself)<br/>
and after I said it the adult looked at me and said &quot;she already let me know<br/>
she liked it.&quot;<br/>
It stopped me short.Made me realize that a thank you doesn&#39;t always have to<br/>
be said to show  &quot;I like this or thanks.&quot;<br/>
  I do have a question.....we have a relative that comes once a year for several days. She insists on kissing the kids on their lips. My kids really dislike it. My husband has mentioned it to her but no change.When my oldest turned her head away and kissed her on the cheek...she would take her face in her hands and hold her still and plant one on their lips. What&#39;s the best response? She will stand in front of me until I kiss her. I tried to turn my face to kiss her on the cheek but she will be persitent. She gets a &quot;look&quot; on her face so I usually give in and kiss her quick.I feel very uncomfortable...have told her myself that the kids weren&#39;t raised kissing on the lips and they feel uncomfortable but maybe too much time goes by between visits and she forgets.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-23687413">Hi Sharon,<br/>
<br/>
My sister has read my book and she chose not to comment. She&#39;s nine <br/>
years younger than me and used to leave notes lying around for me to <br/>
find, &quot;Why are you ruining Laurie&#39;s life?&quot;  things like that. I <br/>
believe my sister would be less rigid in spite of being a <br/>
teacher/curriculum coordinator, but my bil is extremely rigid and <br/>
domineering and she tries to keep him happy too. She&#39;s one of these <br/>
women that can never say no. Because of that, she&#39;s suffering from <br/>
more health issues than anyone in our extended family. Her stress <br/>
level is off the charts. My bil had a heart attack earlier this <br/>
year. <br/>
<br/>
They are Christian, but not fanatically so, although with her recent <br/>
wave of health problems, she seems to have turned more to God than <br/>
ever before. My theory is that bil is rigid because he grew up in a <br/>
home that was full of angst, anger, alcohol abuse and 4 sisters who <br/>
were all younger than him. He was the man of the house from a very <br/>
young age. He grew up in a chaotic home with no guidance (it seems) <br/>
and wants to make sure he keeps a firm hand on discipline with his <br/>
boys. <br/>
<br/>
All of this is just guessing for me. They are pretty closed about <br/>
feelings and refuse to discuss issues where we disagree. My sister <br/>
and I agreed to keep opinions to ourselves years ago when I <br/>
suggested she try brown rice and whole wheat bread and her anger <br/>
astounded me. Needless to say, the kind of parenting I did is not <br/>
open to discussion. :-(  It truly saddens me because she would be an <br/>
awesome unschooling mom. <br/>
<br/>
With their friends, they seem to hold themselves up as the couple to <br/>
emulate. Perfection runs rampant! They are so very very hard on <br/>
themselves. He works fulltime and owns two carwashes and she works <br/>
overtime daily (without extra pay) and is the head of communications <br/>
for the teachers in the entire parish. She also teaches Sunday <br/>
School. An overachiever who&#39;s killing herself for everyone else. <br/>
<br/>
Of course you can come spend the evening with me! I spent 30 minutes <br/>
today laughing at Maelu. I gave her the empty peanut butter jar and <br/>
she got every tiny bit of it from the bottom then shredded the <br/>
label. Maelu is the dog, not a child. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>

I would love for her to visit our family that there would be NO kissing <br/>
on the lips nor would you be forcing your children to give hugs or <br/>
kisses.  If she was OK with that then she would be joyfully welcomed, <br/>
but if she couldn&#39;t abide by that - and mean it - then she&#39;d have to <br/>
postpone her visit until she was ready to do that.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s just me though and I can be forceful even with family.  I&#39;m the <br/>
&quot;bossy loudmouth&quot; in my family though I like to think of me as truthful <br/>
and strong.  ;)  hee hee<br/>

A film makers&#39; trick to keep a barking dog from disturbing the shooting is<br/>
to give the dog a wad of peanut butter, with a dog biscuit or just a lump of<br/>
it. The stuff sticks around their tongue and mouth and they spend ages<br/>
chewing instead of barking. They usually like it as a treat.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1384656006">Tracy,<br/>
 Hmmmm...any chance I could bribe you into a phone call?<br/>
Just teasing!!<br/>
  I know it will need to be done. I&#39;m afraid every time I have been firm on<br/>
something it back fires and I end up being &quot;the bad guy&quot;.There are other<br/>
issues like: we homeschool, home worship, I&#39;m a stay at home Mom, we cook<br/>
pretty naturally etc. We are really different and live simply.No fancy house<br/>
 new cars every 4 years, designer clothes ( we do the thrift store thing) or<br/>
work 2 jobs and use daycare.<br/>
  They came recently and although I thought it went pretty well....my kids<br/>
said after they left...&quot;there&#39;s something different. I felt a stress  or a<br/>
distance.&quot;  We hear alot about the grandkids nearer to them. Classes,<br/>
parties,zoo trips or vacations. We get birthday pictures and hear what they<br/>
bought for them. When the closer  kids came over for a week to spend with<br/>
them (they are grandparents...did you guess?) we heard what they did daily.<br/>
Horse back riding, swimming, eating out,fishing etc. I didn&#39;t read it all to<br/>
my kids because they don&#39;t ever do those things when they come. They would<br/>
have been hurt.My kids very perceptively said they feel that the<br/>
grandparents have favorites and it isn&#39;t them!<br/>

children?  Is it your DH&#39;s parents?  I&#39;m assuming they are.  Has DH <br/>
actually &quot;laid down the law&quot; with them about the kisses or was it sort <br/>
of half-hearted so as not to ruffle feathers on their end and to smooth <br/>
you down at the same time?<br/>
<br/>
My DH is extremely protective of me and our children (in a *good* way - <br/>
not a psycho way LOL ;-).  The first time I realized this was when I <br/>
was upstairs in my bed in loooong labor with baby #1 and just needed to <br/>
-sleep-.  My mom popped over to be where the excitement was but at this <br/>
point there wasn&#39;t much going on except &#39;stalled&#39; labor.  He forbade my <br/>
mother from going upstairs &quot;just for a minute&quot; because he knew that I <br/>
would struggle to stay awake and make small talk with her instead of <br/>
getting the sleep I so desperately needed.  He blocked the stairs and <br/>
everything until she left in a huff.  When I found out I was a little <br/>
afraid for a moment -- as if *I* were going to get in trouble with my <br/>
mom like I was 12 and a friend smart-mouthed my mom or something.  LOL  <br/>
After my mind cleared and our DS was born I realized that *no one* had <br/>
ever really stood up for me and MY needs before.  Never.  I felt very <br/>
loved.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry you have to deal with poopy-in-laws.  Especially ones with <br/>
obvious favorites.  My dad&#39;s mother played favorites *big time* with <br/>
one set of cousins.  Their mom (my aunt) was not the best mom.  Bar <br/>
hopping every night and ummmm kind of sleazy.  I think my Grandma felt <br/>
sorry for them (guilt for her daughter being a crappy mom?) so she <br/>
bought them all kinds of things all the time.  I remember one time the <br/>
whole family was over Gram&#39;s house for xmas and we had all opened our <br/>
gifts and were playing with them.  My cousin, Penny, said &quot;Let me show <br/>
you something!&quot;  We went to Grandma&#39;s bedroom and under her bed was <br/>
*stuffed* with wrapped gifts.  How exciting!  Nope.  Penny said, <br/>
&quot;Grandma said those are for us (her and her sister) after everyone <br/>
leaves!&quot;  My cousin didn&#39;t mean any harm by it -- she just wanted to <br/>
share her excitement with me, but my sister and I felt very bad.  We <br/>
knew that we weren&#39;t the favorites, but we&#39;d never seen it so obviously <br/>
prior to that.  ::sigh::<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for going on about a sad xmas and all.  LOL  I was just trying to <br/>
say that I understand.  BTDT<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck!<br/>

Not commenting about this specific post but about the kissing  thing.  I <br/>
always stood up for my boys in the moment.  When a well  meaning relative would <br/>
say &quot;come give auntie a hug&quot; or something like that and  the boys would grab my <br/>
arm or say no.  I would always say &quot;that&#39;s OK, you  don&#39;t have to if you don&#39;t <br/>
want to&quot; to my son.  And in front of the  person.  That way the person would <br/>
get the point that I would stick up for  my sons decision and we didn&#39;t have <br/>
to talk person to person about it before  hand.  Now all of my relatives have <br/>
taken it OK and walked away OK about  it.  It never escalated beyond that.  <br/>
 <br/>
Just my thoughts,<br/>

  that is a good idea. Have you never had a relative say anything later to<br/>
you or others?<br/>
  I can see as I read everyones posts and my own that my difficulty is being<br/>
concerned with what others think of me more than standing up for my kids!!<br/>
Hmmmm.....I don&#39;t like that in me.<br/>
  I think that in our society we are programmed to think of the adults over<br/>
children.Not a good excuse at all and kind of crummy......and in need of an<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-381223452">Kate,<br/>
 thanks!! that approach sounds very do-able for me. I think the relatives<br/>
would understand that.<br/>
  Wish I had thought of that a while ago...but that&#39;s why it is nice to have<br/>
a board like this. when my mind is stumped it can get jump started by better<br/>
ideas.<br/>

  I think that&#39;s great.  Have you had to make any choices with family on<br/>
this issue?Did the family member always accept your position? If not have<br/>
you &quot;not seen them?&quot; Has it made any problems in your immediate family?<br/>
  This is probably a pretty flawed reasoning but we know no other<br/>
unschoolers. When we get together it is mostly homeschoolers (school at home<br/>
type) and occasionally public school kids.We don&#39;t see eye to eye on things.<br/>
<br/>
 We used to be the strict schoolers that had no tv, no computer games or<br/>
video games. It seemed we knew families that allowed it and we were the odd<br/>
man out. The past year we are now the ones with computer & video games and<br/>
allow tv.I thought we would fit in better but not so.It is a new group this<br/>
year and  I listen to the discussions at karate & swimming about how<br/>
terrible they are or &quot;we don&#39;t allow that in our house.&quot; I was asked once if<br/>
we allowed video games...I said &quot;yes, my son has an xbox he bought with his<br/>
own money. he really enjoys it.&quot; Silence!!<br/>
  I try to find things to talk about that we agree on and stay away from the<br/>
 differences. The homeschoolers seem cliquish and it doesn&#39;t take much to<br/>
feel you don&#39;t belong. At swimming I have had to go up to the women to start<br/>
a conversation. It doesn&#39;t last long. Now I just go and sit/watch the kids<br/>
swim. It is for them anyway.<br/>
  My husband is in another state getting ready to deploy overseas....I just<br/>
talked to him on the cell phone. I asked him about talking to his family<br/>
(parents) and he said he has no problem...I am the one that talks him out of<br/>
it. He&#39;s right. I had said that on a previous post. I need to work on it.<br/>
  He also told me that I need to put the kids before others ideas or<br/>
opinions. If we don&#39;t have many outside friends that&#39;s ok...as long as we&#39;re<br/>
together as a family and everythings ok. What good is it to have friends you<br/>
aren&#39;t yourself with and you don&#39;t agree with? <br/>
I miss him being here to talk to.<br/>
  thanks for listening and helping me to see the real issue is with me<br/>

that is  a good idea. Have you never had a relative say anything later to<br/>
you or  others?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
Never, maybe because I am directing my comments to my sons, it is in  earshot <br/>
of the person asking for the hug or the kiss, but is not confronting  them or <br/>
saying that what they are doing is bad, directly.  It is just  reassuring my <br/>
boys that they have a right to say no if they wish, and I will  stand with <br/>
them.  I always hated that with my parents, I had to hug  grandma.  Hated it.  <br/>

<br/>
Mary Ellen&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to add that it&#39;s also a boundary issue and one thing that&#39;s helped<br/>
my kids is our having strong ways of stating our boundaries particuarly<br/>
about our bodies.  I was at my SIL&#39;s one day when my son was young and my<br/>
brother was playing a chase game with him that my son was thoroughly<br/>
enjoying.  But when my brother got close, my son screamed at the top of his<br/>
lungs.  My SIL went up gently, got down on his level and said &quot;Hey, Nicky,<br/>
you can use your stop sign like this..&quot; and she put up her hand in a stop<br/>
sign.  We all loved it and thus the &quot;Body Stop Sign&quot; was born at our house -<br/>
it has been fabulous and is enforced by me when necessary but generally just<br/>
hugely respected by each kid because they want it to be respected when they<br/>
use it.<br/>
<br/>
Kids should definitely know that they can speak up and be supported if a<br/>
relative is doing something they don&#39;t like to their bodies.  My favorite<br/>
story about this is that my father in law who is Sicilian is very tuned out<br/>
to  younger kids in particular and likes to just grab the younger ones and<br/>
hug them.  To him it&#39;s a game.  To them it&#39;s terrifying to be grabbed<br/>
against your will and submitted to a hug.  He&#39;s ruined his relationship with<br/>
his oldest Grandaughter, Chiara, over this type of treatment.  We live<br/>
further away, but it was an issue for my daughter as well - and given that<br/>
she&#39;s highly sensitive, she FELT it a lot.  Now the thing is that my Mother<br/>
in law is always telling him to cut it out (usually in a string of<br/>
Sicilian) - she is fabulous about respecting kids&#39; space and letting them<br/>
come to her after they connect with her.  So I&#39;ve never felt the need to<br/>
have a specific conversation with my FIL about it since his wife is forever<br/>
having that conversation with him but not to much permanent effect.  Since<br/>
we don&#39;t see them often, it wasn&#39;t a real biggie, but they visited when my<br/>
son was young and my daughter was about 3 or so.  Usual grabbing thing and<br/>
then MIL telling him off ... my dd was sitting on a chair regarding him that<br/>
first day of the visit and she turned to me (close by and ready to intervene<br/>
to prevent any grabbing trauma) and said &quot;Mama, how do we get the grab out<br/>
of Nonno?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well it was a bit uncomfortable with my FIL sitting right there, but I<br/>
ignored my own social stuff and said &quot;Well, maybe you could tell him how<br/>
much you don&#39;t like it and ask him not to do it again.&quot;  So she turned to my<br/>
FIL and said &quot;Nonno, I don&#39;t like it when you grab me.  Could you please<br/>
stop?&quot;  And do you know what?  He DID.  He NEVER grabbed her again which<br/>
shows the power of her saying it to him instead of all of us whom he<br/>
probably dismissed in his head as not getting that it was playful.  In his<br/>
head I think he really thought the kids enjoyed it regardless of their<br/>
reactions which he wasn&#39;t tuned into.  It took her telling him for him to<br/>
really get it and WOW, what empowerment for my daughter!  We went out this<br/>
past April to visit my in-laws (they are in Michigan, we are in<br/>
Massachusetts) for Easter and my daughter decided her &quot;favorite&quot; was Nonno -<br/>
she sat in his gruff lap and kissed him much to my astonishment all the time<br/>
and wow, did it change his demeanor and his gruffness to have her doing<br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one story with a good ending....on the other side of things, I have a<br/>
BIL near me (my sister&#39;s husband) who yells at his daughter a lot and<br/>
despite conversations I&#39;ve had with him about it, he just can&#39;t control<br/>
himself enough not to do the yelling around us (it&#39;s not &quot;at&quot; my dd, and<br/>
it&#39;s not derrogatory stuff with name calling but she&#39;s very sensitive to how<br/>
others are treated and I agree).  So she&#39;s decided she doesn&#39;t want to be<br/>
around him anymore although she still loves my niece his daughter, so we are<br/>
honoring that despite the difficulty of telling him about it and arranging<br/>
playdates with my niece where she doesn&#39;t see him for more than a pickup or<br/>
drop off.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I&#39;m not a confrontational person at all, so I&#39;ve had to drag myself<br/>
into doing these things, but I do it because the import to my kids and their<br/>
future lives and feelings about themselves is huge and way more important<br/>
than my own reluctance, embarassment or any adult hurt feelings.<br/>

  This really made an impression on me. I have allowed my feelings of<br/>
embarrasment to overpower my childs feelings or the opinions/feelings of<br/>
other adults. Much to my regret. Thank you for putting it into words....it<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-4037551">WOW!  I&#39;ve been reading all these comments on allowing kids to say no to unwanted physical contact and am so glad to hear it.  I have a vivid memory of when I was a little girl hiding behind a reclining chair while my parents and grandparents were making me &quot;go and give your &quot;uncle&quot; a kiss...&quot;  I was so scared and felt so bad at the same time that I was hurting his feelings.  I ended up letting him hug me....It&#39;s odd now when I look at how that lesson played a very large part in my future relations with the opposite sex.  Thankfully now I have had the privilege of standing up for my daughter where her grandfather was concerned.  I was nervous and scared to confront him ( hurt his feelings..), but I spoke to the man on the phone and confronted him with my daughter&#39;s concern.  Even though I believe the grandfather to be innocent in his actions, I knew the effect it would have on my daughter in the long run.  The sad part is I could never stand up for myself.  The great part and the liberating part is that I now get the chance to help my own daughter set boundries for her future...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-238535608">On this particular issue, I&#39;ve never had more than strange looks...but heck,<br/>
I get those all the time anyway!<br/>
Like you, I started being rather restrictive with TV, though not with<br/>
food...and I&#39;ve always respected my kids right to<br/>
say no...so I was an odd mix even when we were restrictive....now we are on<br/>
the other end (and oddly enough, most days my kids watch less TV now then<br/>
when I restricted it!)   we have TV, game cube, game boys, and no rules to<br/>
regulate them. I have slowly changed so people have had time to adjust....I<br/>
am very fortunate to live in an area that is very diverse in population and<br/>
in homeschool styles. I started one of the first inclusive groups in our<br/>
area and have worked hard to make it open to all.  I have friends that are<br/>
waaaayyy restrictive and friends that are like myself and lots somewhere in<br/>
between.  We tend to hang out more with the relaxed families but no one<br/>
gives me a hard time. My family thinks I&#39;m a little nutty...but most of them<br/>
don&#39;t live anywhere near me so I don&#39;t care. I have always done what I think<br/>
is best for my family and they have always saved their comments for talking<br/>
behind my back! ;)<br/>
