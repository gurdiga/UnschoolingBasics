<div id="ygrps-yiv-2109213174">I came across this article and as I read it, I was thinking this is what<br/>
unschooling is like.  I am going to send it to my dh.  Then I thought, well<br/>
if this will help my dh understand a bit better, maybe it will help other<br/>
people.  I have added my comments in [brackets] to show how I relate this to<br/>
unschooling ... pretty much I just kept relating what our kids do is the<br/>
same as what adults do.  So I share it with you.  let me know your comments.<br/>

*** Article: Personal and Professional Development -- What&#39;s the Difference?<br/>
- By Kevin Eikenberry ***<br/>
<br/>
----------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
When people ask me about my business, I tell them I&#39;m in the learning<br/>
business -- that we help organizations, teams and individuals reach their<br/>
potential through learning. This is a fine statement and it does describe<br/>
the breadth of what we do, but it often leads to the follow-up question<br/>
like... &quot;Do you do personal development stuff or just business skills<br/>
training?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My answer is yes. Because I don&#39;t believe there is a significant difference<br/>
between personal development and professional development. Why do I say<br/>
that?<br/>
<br/>
The Reasons Why:<br/>
<br/>
Since my opinion might differ from yours, or perhaps you&#39;ve never thought<br/>
about this, it makes sense to explain myself. There are at least five major<br/>
reasons why I think personal [or parenting] and professional development are<br/>
the same thing. Learning is Learning. We were granted an amazing potential<br/>
for learning at birth. Most of us haven&#39;t used very much of that potential.<br/>
It&#39;s like we are mowing our lawn with a jet engine. Sure the jet engine has<br/>
enough horsepower to turn the blade, but it has virtually unlimited<br/>
potential that isn&#39;t being used. When we are learning we are increasing our<br/>
capacity to learn more because we are flexing and exercising our &quot;learning<br/>
muscles.&quot; In other words, whenever we are learning we are increasing our<br/>
capacity to learn even more.<br/>
<br/>
All Experience Counts. <br/>
<br/>
One of the powerful ways that we learn is by connecting new learning to what<br/>
we already know. As we continue to build our knowledge and experiences, it<br/>
allows us to make new connections faster. In other words, the more we learn,<br/>
the more successful we will be at learning new things, and in most<br/>
situations more quickly with deeper understanding.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re a Whole Package. <br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t like we go to work and don&#39;t use anything we know from our personal<br/>
life to be more effective professionally. And while we may not need to know<br/>
how to repair rotating drum equipment at home--those skills might help you<br/>
diagnose the problem with your washing machine. And even though you don&#39;t<br/>
have to back up the system database at home, you might be able to deal with<br/>
your home PC better because of what you learned at work. And while you hope<br/>
you&#39;ll never need to follow the new Customer Service procedure at home, that<br/>
procedure might teach you something when following a process, or be more<br/>
understanding when you are the customer [or child].<br/>
<br/>
The bottom line is that we are complete humans [children are human too], and<br/>
as such we take our entire work knowledge home and bring all of our personal<br/>
knowledge and experience to work. So any form of growth or development will<br/>
benefit you both personally and professionally.<br/>
<br/>
The Most Important Skills are Always the Most Important. <br/>
<br/>
Where does being a better listener help you--at home or at work? Both, of<br/>
course. When you learn how to coach more effectively at work, does it make<br/>
you a better parent? It sure can! We could make a long list of these<br/>
valuable skills, from communication to dealing with conflict, to learning<br/>
how to learn, to giving better feedback to being more creative... you get<br/>
the idea (and have probably thought of five other examples yourself by now).<br/>
There are many skills that we might learn as &quot;self improvement&quot; that will<br/>
help us at work, and vice versa. So why label it one or the other?<br/>
<br/>
Serendipity Rules. <br/>
<br/>
Because our learning grows based on connections, you never know when<br/>
something you learned on the Discovery Channel might give you an &#39;a-ha&#39; at<br/>
work, or that the insight shared by the seminar leader at work helps you<br/>
solve a vexing problem at home. Again, all development, all learning, all<br/>
growth helps us in all parts of our lives. But wait. Does all of this mean<br/>
that as I become a better knitter or bowler, I&#39;ll be more productive and<br/>
successful at work? Yes, for the reasons I described above (and some others<br/>
too).<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean that your organization should send everyone to knitting<br/>
class or bowling lessons, but it does mean that there is substantial merit<br/>
in supporting any form of learning regardless of the content. In the end, my<br/>
goal is to help you view all skills more broadly in their<br/>
application--instead of classifying some things as &quot;personal development&quot;<br/>
[important/relevant] and therefore they don&#39;t matter at work [or at all].<br/>
<br/>
Learning is learning. Personal development is professional development. When<br/>
you stop worrying about the distinctions, but rather think about the<br/>
applications, you serve yourself and others [your children] much better.<br/>
