<div id="ygrps-yiv-1516965333">I am new to all of this and I am wondering why unschooling is <br/>
better? I think that is what freezes me in my steps is that you can <br/>
teach and not be teaching from a book. My son is in 6th grade and if <br/>
things continue how they are, he is going to fail. I am pulling him <br/>
out as soon as possible as he has fallen through the cracks since he <br/>
is so quiet and wont ask for help. If you unschool dont they still <br/>
need to take the FCAT? How do you get around that? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-333216488">I am so intrigued by this idea. My kids are so bright and awesome. I&#39;ve just pulled them out of ps to blossom into what they were intended to be. They are 14 & 13 year old young men. The question that is on my mind is: Why can&#39;t I just order the Preparation to CAT software and book? I could have them do one page a day and be ready for that &quot;test&quot;. Right now they&#39;re so busy doing homeschool work they don&#39;t have time to &quot;fun&quot; read, or play a boardgame. <br/>
 <br/>
I work full time and they do their lessons during the day. We communicate by webcam and Nextel while I&#39;m away. When I get home, we run to the &quot;Y&quot;, or the library, or the movies, or basketball practice, or church, or.... you get the picture. Then I&#39;m up at 9 PM helping them finish the alloted pages we&#39;ve been told to complete per day (prepackaged curriculum).<br/>
 <br/>
Any positive feedback is appreciated. I&#39;m not as far along on my &quot;journey&quot; as some of you, but I&#39;m open to suggestions.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks, MaryW<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1600317697">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Right now they&#39;re so busy doing homeschool work they don&#39;t have time to<br/>
&quot;fun&quot; read, or play a boardgame. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is why Unschooling is better.<br/>
<br/>
This is an Unschooling list. It is about getting to Unschooling with joy and<br/>
not separating or compartmentalizing life into &quot;learning/work&quot; versus &quot;fun&quot;.<br/>
The suggestions you are likely receive are going to focus on that, *not* on<br/>
how to make the choice of using a prepackaged curriculum work more easily. <br/>
<br/>
My question for you is this: did your sons choose to use this curriculum, or<br/>
is it something you imposed? This is a valid question because you use the<br/>
words &quot;have them do&quot; in reference to the exam preparation.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you have assigned the curriculum because you want to keep<br/>
them busy during the day. Most of us find that our kids are perfectly<br/>
capable of finding enough in their own interests to keep them occupied.<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Then I&#39;m up at 9 PM helping them finish the alloted pages we&#39;ve been<br/>
told to complete per day (prepackaged curriculum).&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This sounds like a passive way of abrogating responsibility for your choices<br/>
by putting it off onto the curriculum, as if it were a sentient entity.<br/>
Guess what? You do not *have to* complete any work in the order or time<br/>
schedule that the curriculum vendors have designed. Your sons can be in<br/>
charge of their own learning schedules. <br/>
<br/>
A curriculum can be treated like a vague overview of the ideas that will be<br/>
presented to school students of the same age, a smorgasbord from which<br/>
Unschoolers may pick and choose at will based on their interests, and use as<br/>
a jumping off point for more investigations. <br/>
<br/>
Please go to www.sandradodd.com/unschooling and read all you can. The parts<br/>
about deschooling and the Certificate of Empowerment are two sections you<br/>
may find particularly relevant.<br/>

don&#39;t take the FCAT or any other test.  We are enrolled if a private  school for <br/>
unschoolers and we only have to report attendance (and it&#39;s free  :-)<br/>

<br/>
Good, because I wasn&#39;t looking for suggestions on how &quot;to make the choice of using a prepackaged curriculum work more easily&quot;. I am trying to find other avenues. That&#39;s why I&#39;m here.<br/>
<br/>
My question for you is this: did your sons choose to use this curriculum, or<br/>
is it something you imposed? This is a valid question because you use the<br/>
words &quot;have them do&quot; in reference to the exam preparation.<br/>
<br/>
This curriculum was chosen by me because I had just pulled both of my boys out of public school. I was fearful that if I didn&#39;t have some awesome totally accredited curriculum in place, the school system would give me a hard time. <br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you have assigned the curriculum because you want to keep<br/>
them busy during the day. Most of us find that our kids are perfectly<br/>
capable of finding enough in their own interests to keep them occupied.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know where you got that. I don&#39;t think that at all. I am here to get other ideas and encouragement. I know my sons are perfectly capable of filling the day w/o any ideas from me or paperwork. My parents live next door and my sisters family next to her. We have horses, dirtbikes, 4 wheelers, skates, etc.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;told to complete per day (prepackaged curriculum).&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This sounds like a passive way of abrogating responsibility for your choices<br/>

Guess what? You do not *have to* complete any work in the order or time<br/>
schedule that the curriculum vendors have designed. Your sons can be in<br/>
charge of their own learning schedules. <br/>
<br/>
Again, out of ignorance of and fear of our homeschool laws. I am here seeking help. Yes, I am aware of my awesome sons.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1753861054">&quot;I am new to all of this and I am wondering why unschooling is <br/>
better?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not just better, it&#39;s the ONLY way to truly honor your child&#39;s <br/>
interests and intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s just put it in personal terms. What if your dh assigned <br/>
you &quot;lessons&quot; to complete each day? What if he either rewarded you <br/>
or punished you according to how well you did on those lessons? What <br/>
if those lessons were really boring to you, but that butterfly on <br/>
the flower outside was very interesting, or that book you really <br/>
wanted to read, or that game you couldn&#39;t wait to play?<br/>
Can you even imagine how damaging his behavior would be to your <br/>
relationship?<br/>
Can you imagine the resentment you&#39;d feel? And how you&#39;d hate being <br/>
told what to do all the time when you really wanted to do other <br/>
things?<br/>
That&#39;s how most children live every day. It sucks.<br/>
Unschooling is valuing the child enough to TRUST that they are <br/>
intelligent and capable.<br/>
That trust says you don&#39;t need to coerce them, you don&#39;t need <br/>
to &quot;teach&quot; anything, you simply need to provide a rich, interesting <br/>
environment and they will flourish.<br/>
<br/>
People always ask about &quot;gaps&quot; in learning. Don&#39;t we all have them?<br/>
Do you know any two adults that have the same knowledge, even in the <br/>
same workplace? If certain knowledge is &quot;basic&quot; (or needed <br/>
information to survive in a certain society), then isn&#39;t it pretty <br/>
BASIC to learn it? YES.<br/>
Children naturally pick up what they are surrounded by.<br/>
My children know a lot of things I don&#39;t know, so they really, truly <br/>
learn from their interests, whether you are aware of it or not!!:)<br/>
<br/>
Anytime you think you want to try something on your children, or <br/>
treat them a certain way, just pretend another adult is doing  it to <br/>
you and suddenly it changes the way you parent and approach <br/>
education.<br/>
It changes your entire life. Unschooling is HEALING...it has the <br/>
power to heal your old wounds about learning and school. It has the <br/>
power to focus your family on relationships, rather than what you <br/>
should try and cram into an unwilling childs head. It has the power <br/>
to change not only your life, but those around you, as you all <br/>
pursue your passions with joy.<br/>
Unschooling IS joy!<br/>
Unschooling is freedom, it is trusting, it is learning together and <br/>
it is the ONLY life for me.:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1157154140">Ren, thank you SOOO much for this beautifully<br/>
articulated answer!!! BTW, I&#39;ve been here a bit, just<br/>
reading and trying to formulate answers to my own<br/>
problem, but this email nicely points me the way.<br/>
<br/>
My problem is my wonderful dh who&#39;s so<br/>
institutionalized in school that he&#39;s having a hard<br/>
time with unschooling. Our son and I have gradually<br/>
been moving towards unschooling, but dh is<br/>
simultaneously resistant and supportive. I think the<br/>
problem he has with it is that our son is a lot like<br/>
him in that they both love to play video games, design<br/>
cool things on the computer, and they both love movies<br/>
and music. So, when John (ds) chooses to play games,<br/>
or watch Monty Python, or listen to The Corsairs, or<br/>
practice his drums for hours on end, dh doesn&#39;t think<br/>
John&#39;s learning anything. He asks ds what he&#39;s done<br/>
for &quot;school&quot; and I see it in ds&#39;s eyes the clamming<br/>
up. I also see in dh&#39;s eyes the bewilderment wrestling<br/>
with frustration. I simply didn&#39;t know how to approach<br/>
this growing path of unschooling we&#39;re now on without<br/>
getting defensive when dh makes comments like, &quot;But he<br/>
*needs* to know X,Y, or Z&quot; or &quot;We&#39;re the parents;<br/>
we&#39;re supposed to *tell* him X, Y, or Z.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t mind, Ren, I&#39;d like to forward dh your<br/>
unschooling philosophy--it so closely correlates with<br/>
what&#39;s in my heart but that&#39;s having a hard time<br/>
getting past my tongue.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; &quot;I am new to all of this and I am wondering why<br/>
&gt; unschooling is <br/>
&gt; better?&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s not just better, it&#39;s the ONLY way to truly<br/>
&gt; honor your child&#39;s <br/>
&gt; interests and intelligence.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Let&#39;s just put it in personal terms. What if your dh<br/>
&gt; assigned <br/>
&gt; you &quot;lessons&quot; to complete each day? What if he<br/>
&gt; either rewarded you <br/>
&gt; or punished you according to how well you did on<br/>
&gt; those lessons? What <br/>
&gt; if those lessons were really boring to you, but that<br/>
&gt; butterfly on <br/>
&gt; the flower outside was very interesting, or that<br/>
&gt; book you really <br/>
&gt; wanted to read, or that game you couldn&#39;t wait to<br/>
&gt; play?<br/>
&gt; Can you even imagine how damaging his behavior would<br/>
&gt; be to your <br/>
&gt; relationship?<br/>
&gt; Can you imagine the resentment you&#39;d feel? And how<br/>
&gt; you&#39;d hate being <br/>
&gt; told what to do all the time when you really wanted<br/>
&gt; to do other <br/>
&gt; things?<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s how most children live every day. It sucks.<br/>
&gt; Unschooling is valuing the child enough to TRUST<br/>
&gt; that they are <br/>
&gt; intelligent and capable.<br/>
&gt; That trust says you don&#39;t need to coerce them, you<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t need <br/>
&gt; to &quot;teach&quot; anything, you simply need to provide a<br/>
&gt; rich, interesting <br/>
&gt; environment and they will flourish.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; People always ask about &quot;gaps&quot; in learning. Don&#39;t we<br/>
&gt; all have them?<br/>
&gt; Do you know any two adults that have the same<br/>
&gt; knowledge, even in the <br/>
&gt; same workplace? If certain knowledge is &quot;basic&quot; (or<br/>
&gt; needed <br/>
&gt; information to survive in a certain society), then<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t it pretty <br/>
&gt; BASIC to learn it? YES.<br/>
&gt; Children naturally pick up what they are surrounded<br/>
&gt; by.<br/>
&gt; My children know a lot of things I don&#39;t know, so<br/>
&gt; they really, truly <br/>
&gt; learn from their interests, whether you are aware of<br/>
&gt; it or not!!:)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anytime you think you want to try something on your<br/>
&gt; children, or <br/>
&gt; treat them a certain way, just pretend another adult<br/>
&gt; is doing  it to <br/>
&gt; you and suddenly it changes the way you parent and<br/>
&gt; approach <br/>
&gt; education.<br/>
&gt; It changes your entire life. Unschooling is<br/>
&gt; HEALING...it has the <br/>
&gt; power to heal your old wounds about learning and<br/>
&gt; school. It has the <br/>
&gt; power to focus your family on relationships, rather<br/>
&gt; than what you <br/>
&gt; should try and cram into an unwilling childs head.<br/>
&gt; It has the power <br/>
&gt; to change not only your life, but those around you,<br/>
&gt; as you all <br/>
&gt; pursue your passions with joy.<br/>
&gt; Unschooling IS joy!<br/>
&gt; Unschooling is freedom, it is trusting, it is<br/>
&gt; learning together and <br/>
&gt; it is the ONLY life for me.:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1918450102">&quot;No I meant why is unschooling better than conventional<br/>
homeschooling. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Same reasons.<br/>
<br/>
School at home is baffling to me now...even though I sorta tried <br/>
it.:)<br/>
You&#39;re saying the school is damaging, that school is not an <br/>
effective method of learning, but you&#39;re trying to keep parts of it.<br/>
Why?<br/>
If the school model is not a good one, then let&#39;s get a whole new <br/>
model.<br/>
Unschooling, again, is the ONLY way to truly honor the child&#39;s <br/>
interests and intelligence.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was on a couple different lists for people homeschooling their pre-<br/>
schoolers. I ran screaming away when a discussion came up about how <br/>
to get the kids to do the work--which I was thinking was fun <br/>
activites! Most of the people used rewards and punishment CONSTANTLY <br/>
in order to get the kids to do what they wanted. They had to keep <br/>
coming up with new ways to &quot;motivate&quot; the kids. It seemed like such a <br/>
huge waste to go from being an AP parent and respecting a child&#39;s <br/>
needs and wants to manipulating them hourly to stay on task. Beside <br/>
which, it didn&#39;t seem to work too well.<br/>
<br/>
There are so many resources available on the internet that you can <br/>
let your children follow their interests and they will learn amazing <br/>
amounts without a curriculm that boxes them into learning certain <br/>
facts in a certain way. <br/>
<br/>
Just a couple of many reasons!<br/>
