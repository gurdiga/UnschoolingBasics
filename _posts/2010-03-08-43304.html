<div id="ygrps-yiv-560511115">I&#39;ve been doing a little &quot;housekeeping&quot; on the list and wanted to keep everyone updated:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve added a couple new moderators to the list: Schuyler and Joyce, both of whom have been around the list for awhile and always have wonderful input. Thanks y&#39;all for helping out!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also recently updated the list guidelines and changed the description on the home page to make it clearer that the list&#39;s focus is whole life/ radical unschooling. Hopefully that will avert some confusion! The list guidelines are in the &quot;files&quot; section here:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/files/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/files/</a><br/>
<br/>
if you want to check them - they haven&#39;t changed all that much, I promise. The short form is: write gently, read gently and Trim Your Posts!<br/>
<br/>
Thank y&#39;all<br/>
