This argument about bedtimes and foods is tiring to be honest. <br/>
I have seen it on so many lists. I know some people feel very <br/>
strongly that it is not respectful to limit a child&#39;s choices while <br/>
others don&#39;t see it that way. Do we have to continue battling this?<br/>

Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
I have been lurking to learn on unschooling lists for a couple of years now.  <br/>
I went into lurkdom WAY back then after seeing the tongue lashing other <br/>
hopeful but naive unschoolers-to-be got on the unschooling discussion list...scared <br/>
me silly, so I learned to just read and evolve quietly.  I want to add that I <br/>
LOVE this new list...thanks Kelly, Rue, Ren (and whoever else was involved in <br/>
starting it)!<br/>
<br/>
 Anyway,  I find that by reading the threads on various topics I&#39;m &#39;getting <br/>
it&#39; (trust) more and more.  At first, I thought I could just unschool on the <br/>
learning parts, and still keep the control of bedtimes and sweets, processed, <br/>
junk foods.  I thought *that was part of being a good mom...controlling the <br/>
things that I thought *I* knew better than Em.  However, the more I read, the more <br/>
I feel my ideas changing..  <br/>
<br/>
So, *I* find the threads on bedtimes and foods extremely helpful since these <br/>
are the situations I have had a hard time completely letting go of.  It&#39;s a H <br/>
U G E pardigm shift for me, who is really into organic, nutritious foods, but <br/>
the more I read, the more I&#39;m able to wrap my brain around the idea...now to <br/>
be able to DO IT!  <br/>
<br/>
I can already see that by modeling eating healthy and providing healthy (as <br/>
well as not) Emma (5) IS beginning to make choices that *I actually feel good <br/>
about a lot of the time..and they are HER choices, not my nagging &#39;have to&#39;s&#39;.  <br/>
I&#39;ve relaxed more about the sweets and not-so-nutritious foods, but I know I <br/>
have a ways to go.  But I also do recognize by relaxing my ideas about food, <br/>
our lives are so much more pleasant.  I&#39;m beginning to see that all the whining <br/>
and arguments related to them as totally and completely unnecessary....as <br/>
well as unfair and even unkind of me :(  <br/>
<br/>
*For me*  I really DO WANT unschooling to become  more of a way of life, <br/>
enveloping ALL aspects of our families lives, not just the things that could be <br/>
pegged as &#39;learning&#39;.  The broader &#39;definition&#39; of unschooling resonates with <br/>
me, and I really feel if I can just let go, it&#39;ll mean our family will grow in <br/>
our connectiveness...but I just haven&#39;t quite gotten there when it comes to <br/>
food and sleep.  But I keep reading and trying, reading and trying to get there.  <br/>
<br/>
I tried putting out all the halloween candy last year (from a thread on <br/>
unschoolingdiscussion) and it was devoured in 2 days by my then 4 year old....I got <br/>
cold feet :-/ and backed way off in that I didn&#39;t &#39;display&#39; all the sweets, <br/>
etc.   I haven&#39;t been able to make that huge leap of faith that eventually it <br/>
would subside.  But I am working on it.<br/>
<br/>
So anyway, I just wanted to PLEAD :)  don&#39;t move too far from the whole life <br/>
unschooling threads.  I still need &#39;those&#39; conversations!  I&#39;m in the middle <br/>
of my metamorphosis here!!  : )<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
Denise<br/>
