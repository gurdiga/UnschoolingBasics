<div id="ygrps-yiv-948477973">It&#39;s almost time for the 2nd annual Learn Nothing Day and the Johnson City unschoolers invite you to join us for a celebration in TN. We&#39;ll meet at Rock Creek just like last year for a picnic, swimming and general fun on July 24th at noon.<br/>
<br/>
Overnight guests should check out the Comfort Inn as it&#39;s conveniently located and inexpensive. Earthfare is just down the road too!<br/>
<br/>
Plan on bringing food, drinks, swimming gear etc...  There is hiking available, bbq pits and bathrooms/changing areas. There is a $2 day fee when you get to the park (self service payment as you drive in) so bring a bit of cash.  See you there!!<br/>
<br/>
Any questions, write me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:starsuncloud@...">starsuncloud@...</a>.</div>
