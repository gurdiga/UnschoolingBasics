<div id="ygrps-yiv-747976703">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;No; she doesn&#39;t know the alphabet.  She knows a fun song that rhymes. <br/>
Later it will be relevant as to being the alphabet.  A lot of kids learn<br/>
this way, but I&#39;m not so sure it is the best way to teach reading. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, I don&#39;t think either that learning the alphabet is important for<br/>
learning to read. The alphabet is important later, when you want to look<br/>
something up in a dictionnary :D<br/>
