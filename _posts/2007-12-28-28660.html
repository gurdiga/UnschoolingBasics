<div id="ygrps-yiv-1297403369">I could be going about this so much better, but I don&#39;t know how.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest is 7 1/2.  The current situation looks something like this<br/>
(although we have variants on a regular basis)...<br/>
<br/>
My daughter&#39;s schooled friend Hannah is over during her vacation.  Marti (my<br/>
dd) is always asking if Hannah can come over.  Now that she is here though,<br/>
all Marti wants to do is play video games (which is fine, normally), but she<br/>
expects Hannah to just sit there and watch her.  Hannah keeps trying to get<br/>
up which leads me to believe that Hannah is bored.  So Marti moves from<br/>
video game to video game trying to keep Hannah wanting to just sit there and<br/>
watch her, but Hannah would rather go and play with the younger kids.  Marti<br/>
gets upset.<br/>
<br/>
So, Marti sulks on the couch.  I try to go comfort her.  I try and give her<br/>
ideas to help her.  She could play a 2 player game, she could try playing<br/>
something Hannah wants to play, etc.  My ideas only make her more upset and<br/>
frustrated.  She attacks all my ideas with reasons why those things won&#39;t<br/>
work.  Clearly she doesn&#39;t want my advice so I end up walking away (due to<br/>
my own frustration many times), but then she is still upset.<br/>
<br/>
What could I be doing better?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Can you help Hannah and Marti problem solve it together? What does <br/>
Hannah want to do? What does Marti want to do? <br/>
<br/>
Maybe playing in two seperate places will work for them. Maybe they <br/>
need help expressing what they need. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe they might like  a suggestion of a mutual activity to help <br/>
them interact ie. baking cookies with you an art project, something <br/>
to help them relate.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1416820677">Amanda, what happens when you talk to your DD about this before her friend <br/>
comes over? Julian had a friend (also schooled) that was not allowed to watch TV <br/>
(except for the few selected programs for a short, limited time per day) so <br/>
we would often need to mention and re-mention that fact before she arrived. We <br/>
also decided together that we would not watch TV when she visited. I opted to <br/>
kinda use that time for a bit of info regarding being polite. It worked well - <br/>
BUT - Julian was 4 then and that is WAY different from a 7 year old, indeed. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck! Sounds frustrating, but I betcha something will happen to smooth <br/>
it over soon :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1072207605">Hi Amanda...The first thing that came to my mind is what I do with my<br/>
middle child (she&#39;s 12) which is talk to her about this *before* it<br/>
happens. Talk about what your observations were (her friend being bored,<br/>
etc) and ask her what she thinks about it. My daughter seems to handle<br/>
situations better when the two of us can have some alone time and just<br/>
talk about it. I find that talking to her *while* it&#39;s happening is a<br/>
lose-lose situation.<br/>

<br/>
I think a big problem is that Marti expects that Hannah will want to watch<br/>
her because Marti likes to sit and watch others.<br/>

Amanda, what happens when you talk to your DD about this before her friend<br/>

<br/>
I have to ponder this.  I am not sure I have talked to her about it before<br/>
hand.  That seems silly, doesn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the ideas everyone.  Certainly gives me a different perspective.<br/>

No, I don&#39;t think she does.  Even when I try and explain it, it seems to me<br/>
that she doesn&#39;t care because she wants to go right back to the thing that<br/>
SHE wants to do.<br/>

No, I don&#39;t think she does.  Even when I try and explain it, it seems <br/>

that<br/>

<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why it seems to work best if you can talk about when some other <br/>
time---when the friend&#39;s not there and she&#39;s in a good mood, not busy <br/>
with something, and open to discussion.<br/>
<br/>
When it happens to *her* would be a possible time to open that <br/>
discussion too---when *she* is feeling the hurt, when she *does* care.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In the moment&quot; is often a bad time to even mention stuff like that.<br/>
<br/>
Brainstorm options for when she *is* in the moment. Maybe decide on a <br/>
&quot;secret word&quot; that could trigger her to change---that way it doesn&#39;t <br/>
look like a direct &quot;order&quot;---just a reminder.<br/>
<br/>
Duncan can get mouthy sometimes---goes on and on and on about something <br/>
that&#39;s obviously not interesting to his listener, but *he* is really <br/>
excited about. And he used to get overly excited and just spin out of <br/>
control. We came up with &quot;Beep Beep&quot; from Stephen King&#39;s _It_. When one <br/>
of the character&#39;s has gone too far, his friends say &quot;Beep Beep&quot; to <br/>
bring him down.<br/>
<br/>
We say it quietly to Duncan, and that&#39;s his cue to understand he&#39;s <br/>
going too far and needs to reel it in a bit. It doesn&#39;t embarrass  or <br/>
frustrate him &#39;cause he was part of the solution. It&#39;s just his cue, <br/>
and he likes it because he doesn&#39;t want to bore others or get too out <br/>
of control. He just needed help in these situations, and it seems to <br/>
work really, really well for him.<br/>
