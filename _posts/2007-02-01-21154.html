<div id="ygrps-yiv-182659879">This strikes me as a strange question, but does anyone have any experience getting glasses in a non-coercive manner for a youngish (7yo) child who doesn&#39;t want them?<br/>
<br/>
My son couldn&#39;t read the bottom 5 lines (out of 10?) on the wall chart at his check-up.  I explained later, in a very low-key manner, that that indicated that we should see an eye-doctor to get glasses.  That with glasses he would find that things that are hard to see or blurry now we be clear for him.  He said, &quot;No.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve made an appointment for both us -- me first (I&#39;m way overdue for a eye exam anyway) and then him right after.  Just knowing his personality (very shy, resists going new places or places with lots of people), it will take some coaxing to even get him into the office with me although I think he&#39;ll cooperate for the exam.  I&#39;d like to just get the glasses and suggest he try them frequently without constantly nagging him, but I guess I&#39;m a little leary -- concerned he&#39;ll just refuse and not ever learn how much easier it is to see with them unless we insist he wear them.  That if we set a precedent of not insisting...<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I have to admit that even typing this out I&#39;m beginning to think it&#39;s ludicrous.  Of course, in time, he&#39;ll come to realize he can see better with them.  In time, he&#39;ll get used to them.  And even if I pay for glasses he hardly ever wears at this age, why is my nagging him into wearing them an improvement?  But I&#39;d still be interested in others&#39; experiences!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1588471214">After writing our experience, I realise that we didn&#39;t have much problem<br/>
getting him there, and getting the exam :-)  Have him come in *with*<br/>
you, to see your exam.  If he doesn&#39;t want to that day, wait.  If it&#39;s<br/>
not bugging him, he won&#39;t find the need for them.  If he comments about<br/>
things he doesn&#39;t see that others do, explain to him the role of the<br/>
glasses, ask if he&#39;d like an appointment to see if he needs glasses,<br/>
etc...  If he doesn&#39;t want them, he won&#39;t want to wear them, even if he<br/>
sees better with them on.  Eventually, he *might* get the advantages,<br/>
but until he&#39;s ready, he won&#39;t see it... <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
With my oldest, the only one who does need glasses, we didn&#39;t have any<br/>
problems with the eye doctor.  When he got his glasses things were OK,<br/>
although he didn&#39;t understand *why* he needed those glasses...<br/>
farsighted? --&gt; NOt sure about the traduction here...  Anyways.  He&#39;d<br/>
wear them some, lose them, we&#39;d find them again lost them again, etc...<br/>
We talked about the difference between both eyes that was the major<br/>
concern for the glasses in the first place.  After 2 lost pairs, I<br/>
talked with him about seeing a holistic eye doctor, that uses exercises<br/>
and other stuff to correct the problem instead of glasses.  He was<br/>
willing to go, and this doctor (really, really nice!)  explained to HIM<br/>
why he needs glasses, what are his eye &quot;problems&quot; etc...  Felix<br/>
explained why he didn&#39;t like glasses.  He now has contact lenses that he<br/>
wears when he remembers or feels like it.  The doctor knows that the<br/>
frequency isn&#39;t great, but he&#39;s OK with it.  <br/>

I often wander around the house without my glasses. I put them on to  <br/>

If he does play sports in the future or has to sit too close to the  <br/>

he&#39;ll see with glasses -- blurry will just be normal to him! -- you  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t give you parent&#39;s perspective, but I can tell you that when I<br/>
was little (maybe age 5) I needed glasses and my parents bought them<br/>
for me. I wore them on and off for about a year, at first I thought<br/>
they were kind of cool but that novelty wore off pretty fast and I<br/>
began to wear them less and less until eventually I just stopped. For<br/>
about six years I didn&#39;t use glasses at all - it wasn&#39;t until age 12<br/>
or so that *I* felt the need for them.<br/>
<br/>
Until that point I was able to read and see okay, I just sat close to<br/>
the tv or held the book against my face, lol, but to me that was<br/>
better than wearing glasses. When I was 12 I began to notice a big<br/>
difference in my eyesight - I&#39;ve heard puberty can cause this - and so<br/>
I voluntarily got glasses. At 15 I switched to contacts, it was almost<br/>
like a unveiling of my blossoming teenager self, a &quot;coming of age&quot;<br/>
sort of thing, to take the glasses off.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I don&#39;t know how not wearing glasses for all those years affected<br/>
my eye development. Maybe it hurt, or maybe my eyesight would have<br/>
continued to get poorer no matter what (my parents, grandparents,<br/>
aunts, and sister have the same issue, so I think it&#39;s genetic). This<br/>
is something you&#39;ll want to get a unbiased opinion on, to see if<br/>
wearing or not wearing will affect his eyesight in any substantial<br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, most eye doctors will automatically expect him to wear them<br/>
if he has poor eyesight, so you might have to phrase your question a<br/>
few different ways before they;ll finally hedge out an answer to what<br/>
you&#39;re really asking (because they&#39;ll likely be of the opinion that<br/>
not wearing glasses just isn&#39;t an option).<br/>
<br/>
If he chooses not to wear glasses, just keep an eye on him for<br/>
headaches or other signs that he is experiencing eyestrain. At that<br/>
point I would revisit the issue.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1013693202">Hi Katharine,<br/>
<br/>
Both of my kids wear glasses.  My daughter has worn<br/>
them since kindergarten, and my son, since first<br/>
grade.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess both of my kids are odd.  My daughter has to<br/>
wear hers all the time, and she loves them.  She knows<br/>
that glasses can be fun, because she can pick them out<br/>
to match her personality, or just because she thinks<br/>
they look cool.  She doesn&#39;t mind wearing them at all.<br/>
<br/>
My son wears his for up close work.  We didn&#39;t know he<br/>
needed them, until he was doing homework, and he was<br/>
complaining about how his eyes hurt, and he had a<br/>
headache.  He ended up needing them, and has sometimes<br/>
forgotten to put them on, and sometimes he forgets to<br/>
take them off.  He doesn&#39;t mind wearing his, either.<br/>
<br/>
As far as going into the eye doctors exam room, my<br/>
daughter has me go in with her.  She is just more<br/>
comfortable with that.  Maybe the eye doctor would let<br/>
you have your ds sit on your lap, or at the very least<br/>
go in with him.  Sometimes having mom with a child<br/>
makes them more comfortable.  You could also take him<br/>
in with you, and let him watch, so that he knows the<br/>
exam doesn&#39;t hurt.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if this helps, but the ladies in our eye<br/>
doctors office often help with picking out glasses. <br/>
If people don&#39;t make comments like &quot;i&#39;m sorry you have<br/>
to wear glasses, etc. &quot;, and actually tell him how<br/>
cool the glasses are, I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll be fine.<br/>
<br/>
It will all work out.  Sooner or later, he&#39;ll find<br/>
that he can see better with his glasses, than without.<br/>
 I remember when I first got mine, in 9th grade, I hid<br/>
them, and wouldn&#39;t wear them.  After a while, I<br/>
figured out that they can be fun, and can be picked<br/>
out to match my personality, or just something I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t normally wear.  If you make it fun, it won&#39;t<br/>
be so bad.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-155366704">Hi Katharine,<br/>
<br/>
My son *failed* the eye exam at the pediatrician&#39;s office a couple of years <br/>
ago.  We were worried about him having glasses and being responsible for them <br/>
and so on.  When we went to the ophthalmologist, he passed the exam with flying <br/>
colors.  Wait until your son is actually prescribed the glasses before you <br/>
start worrying about how you&#39;re going to get him to wear them.  The eye <br/>
specialist will have gone through the new glasses routine before and will probably <br/>
have some ideas about how to help with the transition, if necessary. <br/>
<br/>
If his vision is really bad and he can see clearly with glasses, common sense <br/>
may take care of all your worries and your son will love being able to see so <br/>
he&#39;ll want to wear the glasses.  <br/>
<br/>
Best wishes for a clearer future and welcome to the list.<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It probably didn&#39;t do any harm for your eyes. In fact, according to one<br/>
of my college-level neuroscience textbooks, you can improve your<br/>
eyesight by spending an hour every day practicing looking at objects<br/>
that are at a distance that&#39;s just getting blurry. Now, not wearing<br/>
glasses might harm your kid&#39;s development in other ways, such as if he<br/>
has lots of headaches due to eyestrain. <br/>
<br/>
So, anyway, I got my first glasses at age 9, because my parents were<br/>
getting upset with me sitting closer and closer to the tv (about 90% of<br/>
programs are subtitled) and me having more headaches than before, etc.<br/>
I told them I didn&#39;t think I needed glasses, but they took me to the<br/>
optometrist and got me glasses, and I didn&#39;t really mind wearing them<br/>
once I got them (although I&#39;d often forget to put them on in the<br/>
morning, but not on purpose). <br/>
<br/>
For kids especially, or adults involved in sports involving objects<br/>
that might hit the head (e.g. basketball) I recommend titanium frames.<br/>
They&#39;re almost impossible to break. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2053973759">I believe that there are several issues, the first step is he needs to<br/>
be willing to participate in your efforts to have him evaluated for<br/>
glasses. How to get him to wear glasses, is sorta putting the horse<br/>
before the cart, as it were. Creating opportunities for him to become<br/>
familiar and comfortable with the eye exam environment, people and<br/>
procedures would be my first steps. I wouldn&#39;t assume that your son<br/>
*not* reading the last 5 lines on the chart concludes that he *can&#39;t*<br/>
read them. <br/>
<br/>
Another variable is that many food chemicals can interfere with our<br/>
ability to focus and participate in something so tedious and boring as<br/>
reading letters on and on and on for no seeming purpose. Helping him<br/>
to understand the variables involved in the assessment. And observe if<br/>
your real life observations concur that your son can not clearly<br/>
visualize different data at varying distances in a manner that meets<br/>
his needs. Basically, I&#39;d also discuss your *son&#39;* observations about<br/>
his ability to see clearly. Does he feel frustrated that he needs to<br/>
get close to items or far from them to see clearly? He is at an age<br/>
where he is probably able to be that self-aware, if you observe some<br/>
visual issue out of the ordinary. <br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, my friend posted this fascinating note elsewhere, and as<br/>
a life-long wearer of glasses, the concepts are intriguing to consider:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; (it is an excerpt from Chinaberry book reviews)<br/>
<br/>
TAKE OFF YOUR GLASSES AND SEE<br/>
A Mind/Body Approach to Expanding Your Eyesight and Insight<br/>
Jacob Liberman , O.D., Ph.D.<br/>
<br/>
The other day I astonished the people around me as I strung seed beads<br/>
in dim light without glasses (I am 54), and I immediately thought of<br/>
this book. Until thirteen years ago I too had felt completely helpless<br/>
without my glasses, which I had worn since I was ten years old.<br/>
Liberman had not yet written this book, so the book that turned me<br/>
around then was by Dr. William Bates, written in the 1920&#39;s. Bates is<br/>
the grandfather of a slew of books, mostly written in the 1980&#39;s and<br/>
1990&#39;s, about improving vision without glasses. I set about to read<br/>
them all. <br/>
<br/>
TAKE OFF YOUR GLASSES AND SEE by Jacob Liberman was the last in a long<br/>
series and my favorite. Liberman actually started out as an<br/>
optometrist, but early on in his practice he couldn&#39;t help wondering,<br/>
&quot;Why do the eyes appear to be the only part of the physical body that<br/>
is not self-healing?&quot; Why indeed?! It is as if, as he says, we went to<br/>
a doctor with a broken arm and were told &quot;no problem, I will fit you<br/>
with this brace to wear for the rest of your life.&quot; I liked Liberman<br/>
the best because he not only gave a description of the very exercises<br/>
(he calls them meditations) that I had been using to improve my<br/>
vision, but he brought in the &quot;mind/body&quot; connection - it is not just<br/>
about improving your acuity at reading letters on a chart twenty feet<br/>
away! <br/>
<br/>
My own example of this is when I tried his idea of &quot;open focus.&quot; He<br/>
warned what might happen emotionally, but I thought because I had been<br/>
doing the other exercises for so long I was beyond that point. I<br/>
remember standing in my kitchen, after a few days of open focus, and<br/>
feeling an emotional blast heading straight at me like an oncoming<br/>
freight train. Two hours and many tears later, it was as if I had<br/>
released a great tightness and grief which never came back, though I<br/>
admit I was somewhat relieved when I figured out where it had come<br/>
from-those few days of open focus. He also has some wonderful<br/>
exercises to release your ability to learn (he himself found reading<br/>
very difficult) as well as to see clearly (they go hand in hand). I<br/>
tried them out - they were both fun and amazing. <br/>
<br/>
This book is not only for those &quot;needing&quot; glasses already but for<br/>
those who would like to know how to keep the excellent vision they<br/>
have, those who would like to help keep their children out of glasses,<br/>
and those who as teachers would like to stem the tide of vision<br/>
problems in their classrooms (which, to mix metaphors, is of epidemic<br/>
proportions). I would love to see the information in this book become<br/>
common knowledge.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes, Pat</div>

an E, right?) but there are still times when I find it more useful <br/>
not to wear them - especially in my artistic endeavors. I love the <br/>
fact that I can take my glasses off and see the whole world <br/>
differently. Its a softer, more comforatble world in many ways, <br/>
without the glasses, with a far greater sense of mystery than the <br/>
world of sharp edges and separation I see through them. <br/>

Your son will find reasons to use glasses or not. I know a <br/>
woodworker who chose not to wear glasses for ten years and worked <br/>
mostly with hand-tools. Then he married another woodworker with lots <br/>
of powertools, and found he wanted to wear his glasses again. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think letting him watch your eye exam is a good idea, and I&#39;d keep <br/>
the second apt, but not try to coax your son into actually doing <br/>
anything. If he seems interested in the process you can offer to let <br/>
him have a look for himself - I was always facinated by the changing <br/>
focus. If you can find a doctor who is willing to play a little (and <br/>
you&#39;re paying for two apts so he&#39;s not feeling rushed!) it could be <br/>
a fun, friendly experience. Especially if you *don&#39;t* place any <br/>
expectations on the outcome. <br/>
