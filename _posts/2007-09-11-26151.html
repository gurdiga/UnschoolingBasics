<div id="ygrps-yiv-1201443355">Okay, I am making myself vulnerable, so here it goes.   I don�t know where<br/>
to start so if I seem to ramble, please forgive me.  When I first starting<br/>
staying at home over 7 years ago, it was due to a complicated pregnancy.  I<br/>
seemed to have time to do all sorts of things.  Fast forward to the end of<br/>
the last school year.  I let my then 4th grader and Kindergartener finish<br/>
their school year, and never took them back.  I decided to homeschool for<br/>
several reasons.  I researched it all summer, spending hours on the computer<br/>
learning about Mr. Holt and Sandra Dodd and countless others who�s name<br/>
escapes me.  When I first decided to homeschool, my vision was waking the<br/>
girls up at 8, fixing a good breakfast of homemade waffles, pancakes,<br/>
oatmeal, etc (not all just a variety of such) and then cleaning off the<br/>
table and having �school�.  I would have �assignments� for them to work on;<br/>
we would incorporate recess and lunch into our day, and spend about 4-5<br/>
hours doing �school�.  Then I read about unschooling and it sounded like<br/>
something that would fit better with my kids, but would take a lot of work<br/>
on my part.  I decided it wasn�t about me; it was about my kids, so I<br/>
started researching specifically unschooling and left the research of<br/>
curriculum out.  I joined this group along with 2 local groups, one<br/>
homeschooling mixed with those that unschool and use curriculum and one that<br/>
was Christian based unschooling.  When our school district had their first<br/>
day back to school, we went on our first homeschool activity at a local<br/>
party place that has the inflatables that the kids can jump and slide down<br/>
and my girls met up with several other homeschooled kids.  They loved it and<br/>
I was introduced to several of the parents.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Fast forward to today.  I have come to realize I stay up too late watching<br/>
TV with my 11 year old (they are educational shows she is interested in but<br/>
up until 1 am when my 6 and 2 year old go to bed at 7).  I wake up tired and<br/>
really cranky until I get the coffee running through my veins.  On Tuesday<br/>
and Thursday, my oldest serves at our church from 10-12 so I make her get up<br/>
at 8 to take her shower and get ready to go.  She is not getting enough<br/>
sleep and is /was cranky and hateful until she drank her coffee.  Yes, I was<br/>
letting her drink coffee but her dad had a real problem with it so I backed<br/>
him up and she is no longer allowed to drink it.  Anyway, to stop<br/>
rambling�.I am not teaching my kids anything, however they are learning from<br/>
the environment I am providing for them.  I stay on the computer reading<br/>
emails, writing down field trips that my local groups are doing, making<br/>
plans to join them, finding ways to save money, researching recipes to<br/>
stretch our ever shrinking food budget, paying bills, balancing the<br/>
checkbook, etc all while my kids are allowed to do their own thing.  I leave<br/>
Noggin on the TV which some shows they will watch, others they will go into<br/>
their room and grab a toy or make up a game to play.  They all have chores<br/>
they do around the house, and we have several educational toys that teach.<br/>
My 6 year old is addicted to her Lepster Lmax so I bought her some<br/>
educational games to play that will help her write her letters and numbers<br/>
correctly and teach her to read.  I am saving them for Christmas presents,<br/>
but she already has 2 games and she learned how to spell some words with<br/>
them.  My oldest is reading books from the library and watches educational<br/>
shows she is interested in and the occasional Hanna Montana.  I also bought<br/>
her 2 sets of educational Computer Programs that teach math and several high<br/>
school courses.  (She is very smart and picked them out herself to challenge<br/>
herself)  My 2 year old learned how to count to 10 by watching Noggin.  Both<br/>
my 6 and 2 year olds know several Spanish words from watching Dora and<br/>
Diego.  <br/>
<br/>
I writing this email, it doesn�t seem as bad as I thought it was when I<br/>
started typing.  I guess I feel like I don�t have as much educational<br/>
interaction with them as my parents and in-laws feel I should and I am<br/>
starting to doubt myself as a good parent.  I had our church bible study<br/>
last night and my 2 year old got a hold of a marker and colored on my oldest<br/>
one�s door.  When the babysitter (I use the word loosely, she doesn�t seem<br/>
to watch the kids well) brought me the marker and told me she had colored on<br/>
the door, I said �That�s okay.  She is showing her creative side which is<br/>
challenging me to show my tolerance and patient side�.  One of the other<br/>
mothers had a shocked look on her face and said �Wow, that would have been a<br/>
wooden spoon moment in our house, and I would have taught my son that his<br/>
creativity goes on paper, not the doors�.   As I proceeded down the hall to<br/>
explain to my 2 year old that her pretty drawings only go on paper and if<br/>
she colors on the door again (which she has already colored on herself, the<br/>
kitchen table, the kitchen walls, and now a door) she will get the time out<br/>
chair, I wondered�.Am I having the correct response?  She is not getting it,<br/>
the unwanted behavior is continuing.  Would a �wooden spoon� moment teach<br/>
her to stop coloring on everything.  My approach has always been, we need to<br/>
keep the markers and such out of her reach so that she doesn�t color on<br/>
stuff, but the parents in my meeting, their collective response is you teach<br/>
the child not to color with the markers in the first place.  Their word<br/>
�teach� struck a nerve inside me.  I have not been able to teach my 2 year<br/>
old to stay out of stuff.  I have child locks on the bathroom door because<br/>
she will go in there and play with the toilet paper, or run the sink over,<br/>
or anything else you can think of.  At this parents home, she does not have<br/>
any gates or child locks on her doors, she teaches her son (who just turned<br/>
three) to stay out of such things.  I have a lock on my 2 year olds door to<br/>
keep her in her room at night because she will get out of her room and get<br/>
into all kinds of stuff.  Yes, she has gotten time out several times and we<br/>
have had a couple of wooden paddle moments, but she still continues the same<br/>
behavior.  <br/>
<br/>
I am writing because I am actually scheduled to see the author of the strong<br/>
willed child speak in person to get help with my 2 year old daughter.  I do<br/>
not feel spanking for me personally is the answer.  I feel hypocritical when<br/>
I spank my 2 year old because for the 5th time, she hit the dog.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess my rambling email is two fold.  I don�t want to be one of the<br/>
parents formally listed as saying they are homeschooling their children when<br/>
they aren�t and 2, how else can I get my 2 year old�s attention without<br/>
breaking her spirit or will.  I find it all age appropriate behavior, but<br/>
when we are in the presence of other kids her age and her behavior is so<br/>
much worse, and I find out they spank their kids and even keep a wooden<br/>
spoon with them at all times, I wonder if maybe I am the one that has it all<br/>
wrong.  I did google unconditional parenting and plan on trying the library<br/>
to get a copy.  <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1850590951">I certainly don&#39;t think that you are a bad parent.  I<br/>
think you need to take some time to breathe.  I<br/>
remember, that I spanked my kids once or twice when<br/>
they were little.  We stopped doing that, because we<br/>
were teaching the kids it&#39;s not nice to hit, but then<br/>
we spanked them, so we felt like we were sending them<br/>
a mixed message.<br/>
<br/>
Markers can be cleaned off, or painted over.  If you 2<br/>
year old likes to color on things, why not tape pieces<br/>
of paper where she likes to color, or find her a chalk<br/>
board.  I used to let my son go crazy with the<br/>
crayons, when he was little, and we lived in a mobile<br/>
home.  I thought it was cute, until we decided we<br/>
needed to move.  It took some elbow grease, but it all<br/>
came off.  One time he was coloring with markers, and<br/>
colored all over his skin-he was brown, orange, and<br/>
green.  I cleaned him off, and we laughed.  <br/>
<br/>
Just because other people spank their kids, doesn&#39;t<br/>
mean that you are in the wrong, because you don&#39;t.  I<br/>
really don&#39;t think spanking accomplishes anything.  I<br/>
used to take stuff away from my daughter, and it<br/>
didn&#39;t phase her a bit.  She would just find something<br/>
else to do.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard now, even though my kids are 10 and 11.  I<br/>
still have things I need to do, but I always try to<br/>
make sure to stop, and spend time with them, and make<br/>
sure that they know what they do is important to me. <br/>
I know you have more kids than I do, but being a stay<br/>
at home mom, and unschooling is a tough job, but can<br/>
be really rewarding.<br/>
<br/>
I think if it&#39;s possible, find something you guys can<br/>
all do together, whether it&#39;s play bubbles outside, go<br/>
for walks, or go to a park.  I am finding that I&#39;m<br/>
putting more things on the back burner, and spending<br/>
more time doing things with the kids. Mine were in<br/>
public school through their 3rd and 4th grade years.<br/>
<br/>
Even though at times, I think we are still<br/>
deschooling, I think sometimes more me, than the kids,<br/>
we are learning things together.  It&#39;s definately more<br/>
fun than way, and I&#39;m learning right along with them. <br/>
We even have movie days sometimes, where I pop<br/>
popcorn, and ignore the phone, and the housework, and<br/>
just enjoy quiet time with them.<br/>
<br/>
My only advice is (if you can call it that), to stop<br/>
being hard on yourself, and thinking you aren&#39;t a good<br/>
mom.  You are not bad for allowing your two year old<br/>
to be creative, or to not spank your child/children. <br/>
Everyone has their own parenting styles.  There are<br/>
alot of people that don&#39;t agree with the way we raise<br/>
our kids, but I tend to let it go through one ear, and<br/>
out the other.<br/>
<br/>
Take a deep breath, and relax.  Life is good, and is<br/>
meant to be enjoyed.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, and  enjoy your kids.  They grow up way too<br/>
fast.<br/>

Can you tape them and watch during the day? Not only don&#39;t you have  <br/>
to stay up, but the shows are lots shorter when you can skip past the  <br/>

&quot;educational&quot;. I know you were writing partly to see the educational  <br/>
interaction you were doing, but with unschooling everything is  <br/>
educational. Kids learn from what interests them whether than would  <br/>
be something taught in school or not.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Talk about how she can work out the kinks in the system. Perhaps on  <br/>
Monday night she can go to bed earlier. Or she can time shift her  <br/>
shows. Or she can find a different way to help (if *she* wants to  <br/>
help, otherwise it&#39;s conscripted labor).<br/>
<br/>

your husband decided to cut off your coffee. Would you want coffee  <br/>
less? Would you love him more for being so caring?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am not teaching my kids anything<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>School at homers teach their kids. Unschoolers help their kids  <br/>
explore what interests them. They run interesting things through  <br/>
their lives so that they have access to new interests.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Educational&quot; usually means someone has pulled out all the  <br/>
&quot;important&quot; facts and presented them for memorization.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers are more interested in helping their kids make  <br/>
discoveries about the world. The don&#39;t need to be -- and usually  <br/>
won&#39;t be -- &quot;scientific&quot; discoveries. They&#39;ll be &quot;aha&quot; moments for  <br/>
the child, though. *You* most likely won&#39;t see them, but if the child  <br/>
is engaged, they&#39;re making connections and having &quot;aha&quot; moments.<br/>

&gt; my 6 and 2 year olds know several Spanish words from watching Dora and<br/>
&gt; Diego.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The less you can seek comfort in traditional school markers of  <br/>
learning, the more comfortable you&#39;ll be. While it seems wonderous  <br/>
that a 2 yo could master counting, it&#39;s doubtful she really  <br/>
understands the concept of numbers. And yet parents will hold that up  <br/>
as some great achievement. (Just wait, MIT by the time she&#39;s 6! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
The more you&#39;re able to see how much more powerful the thinking is to  <br/>
get through a video game than memorize the numbers, you&#39;ll be much  <br/>
more comfortable with unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; if<br/>
&gt; she colors on the door again (which she has already colored on  <br/>
&gt; herself, the<br/>
&gt; kitchen table, the kitchen walls, and now a door) she will get the  <br/>
&gt; time out<br/>
&gt; chair, I wondered�.Am I having the correct response?  She is not  <br/>
&gt; getting it,<br/>
&gt; the unwanted behavior is continuing.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because she&#39;s not able to understand in a way that will prevent her  <br/>
from doing it yet.<br/>
<br/>
What punishment does is say to her that she is deliberately choosing  <br/>
the wrong action when she knows better. Think about how you felt when  <br/>
someone accused you of doing something wrong and you had done  <br/>
whatever it was with good intentions. Does it make you say &quot;Oh, my  <br/>
goodness, thank you for setting me straight!&quot; or does it make you angry?<br/>
<br/>
She *will* eventually be able to understand. In the meantime you can  <br/>
make sure markers that are around are only washable ones. Or keep  <br/>
them up out of her reach unless she can be closely supervised. *Not*  <br/>
as punishment but as protection.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Would a �wooden spoon� moment teach<br/>
&gt; her to stop coloring on everything.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s such an obvious form of parent child interaction that everyone  <br/>
has access to it. Every parent could use that without extensive  <br/>
reading. So, bottom line, if that type of approach worked, then the  <br/>
whole world would be so well behaved.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but the parents in my meeting, their collective response is you teach<br/>
&gt; the child not to color with the markers in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And most parents send their kids to school, too. Doesn&#39;t make them  <br/>
right.<br/>
<br/>
If the primary way of interacting with their kids is to assume their  <br/>
kids are bad and to punish the badness out of them, I guarantee that  <br/>
a bunch of them will have kids who are rude and defiant and sneaky by  <br/>
the time they&#39;re teens. As soon as kids get big enough to realize  <br/>
they don&#39;t need to do what they&#39;re told, the parents have no  <br/>
effective means of interacting with their kids.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have not been able to teach my 2 year<br/>
&gt; old to stay out of stuff.  I have child locks on the bathroom door  <br/>
&gt; because<br/>
&gt; she will go in there and play with the toilet paper, or run the  <br/>
&gt; sink over,<br/>
&gt; or anything else you can think of.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some kids *are* more active. It&#39;s not your parenting. It&#39;s who your  <br/>
daughter is. Parents who think there&#39;s a one size fits all answer to  <br/>
unique children either were lucky to have easy kids or have beaten  <br/>
their kids into submission and they&#39;re too scared to do something  <br/>
that might get them punished.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s an exaggeration but, if discipline worked, everyone would  <br/>
behave perfectly. If it worked, we could have a list of good and bad  <br/>
behaviors and shock the ones who don&#39;t stick to the good behaviors  <br/>
and they&#39;d learn not to stray. Yeah, right.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; At this parents home, she does not have<br/>
&gt; any gates or child locks on her doors<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t either but that&#39;s because my daughter was a very easy child.  <br/>
At least that much I realized! I could see that my &quot;successes&quot; with  <br/>
her were because of her personality, not because of anything I did! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; she teaches her son (who just turned<br/>
&gt; three) to stay out of such things.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It could be fear he&#39;s reacting to.<br/>
<br/>
It could be his personality.<br/>
<br/>
It could be he truly gets what she&#39;s saying (which comes back to  <br/>
personality.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; how else can I get my 2 year old�s attention without<br/>
&gt; breaking her spirit or will.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unconditional Parenting is excellent. Raising Your Spirit Child may  <br/>
also give you some great insight.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don�t want to be one of the<br/>
&gt; parents formally listed as saying they are homeschooling their  <br/>
&gt; children when<br/>
&gt; they aren�t<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If your children are joyfully interacting with their world, if they  <br/>
have access to new ideas (though they don&#39;t need to pick them up,  <br/>
just be able to reach them when they&#39;re ready for something new, then  <br/>
you can&#39;t go wrong.<br/>
