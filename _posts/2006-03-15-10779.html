<div id="ygrps-yiv-1958946446">Zachary lately seems to be very, very interested in Social Studies. <br/>
He is constantly asking questions about culture, race relations, civil<br/>
rights, etc.  How can I help him in this area?  Do you all have any<br/>
ideas?  I was thinking about suggesting getting him like a<br/>
mini-recorder and perhaps interviewing people on the street or set up<br/>
relaxed interviews (not suit, tie, etc.).  I want to help him because<br/>
he is so sincere in desiring to know this information but yet I don&#39;t<br/>
want to scare him away from it, KWIM?  Maybe if I asked him if he&#39;d<br/>
like to interview someone we know first?  Maybe I shouldn&#39;t ask him at<br/>
all and just let him keep it all in his head?  <br/>
<br/>
Also, a couple of the grandparents who lived in cities happen to be a<br/>
bit on the prejudice side.  He really wants to know how they felt<br/>
about segregation, the fact is I already know.  I&#39;ve told him that if<br/>
he wants to delve in here that he&#39;ll have to keep in mind how people<br/>
are raised and not to make judgements on the grandparents or any<br/>
negatives they may have had against black families rub off on him.  My<br/>
dad, step-dad, MIL and FIL were raised in big cities where segregation<br/>
and bussing were issues, I&#39;m almost worried but at the same time, in<br/>
my mind am trying to think of how you as unschoolers would think.  I&#39;m<br/>
guessing that you believe Zak would be fine and that me not allowing<br/>
this questioning, if the grandparents agreed to questioning, would be<br/>
sheltering him from life.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m excited for him, just at a loss with creative ways to help him<br/>
pursue this interest.  Your thoughts would be greatly appreciated.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1829139444">Sandy, I hear you!  LOL!!<br/>
 <br/>
I think you are right to tell your son in advance that he might hear some,  <br/>
well, disturbing thoughts coming from his family.   Is your son  sensitive to <br/>
this sort of thing?  I remember crying as a child when people  in my family <br/>
made such remarks. <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t know if I would encourage interviewing just anyone unless it is his  <br/>
idea.  <br/>
 <br/>
I actually have a lot of civil rights history in my family.  My  mother&#39;s <br/>
uncle was chief of police in Memphis when Martin Luther King was shot  there.  My <br/>
mother and her sisters would march in the protests, her uncle  begged them to <br/>
stay home when MLK came.  He said he knew there was going to  be big trouble, <br/>
the FBI was preventing him from doing his job properly (although  what did he <br/>
consider &quot;properly&quot; anyway?).  Also, my mother had to cross  picket lines to <br/>
get me to school when they started bussing.  We had bomb  threats constantly.  <br/>
 <br/>
The movie &quot;the Long Walk Home&quot; with Whoopie Goldberg and Sissy Spacek is a  <br/>
good one.  It is based on the bus strike after the Rosa Parks  incident.  <br/>
&quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; might be good to watch, too.<br/>
 <br/>
There is a Civil Rights museum in Memphis in the hotel where MLK was  shot.  <br/>
I hear it is quite disturbing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1969828614">They&#39;ve also been playing  The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman on PBS<br/>
lately (you can also purchase it from pbs.org).  I saw it sometime in my<br/>
junior high/high school years... I watched a bit of it as it was on late a<br/>
few nights ago.  It&#39;s very very intense (I cry when and almost get<br/>
physically sick when I&#39;m confronted with our country&#39;s history of slavery<br/>
and what white men would do to people of color after slavery was abolished)<br/>
but it doesn&#39;t hide any of our history behind a rosy colored lens.  <br/>
<br/>
How old is Zak?  I wouldn&#39;t shelter him from the reality of racism and the<br/>
injustices of our history but it&#39;s most certainly a place where deep<br/>
discussion and guidance is necessary.  <br/>
<br/>
Keep us posted on his research... I&#39;d like to hear more.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1386729716">I would start with some movies and books.  Racial prejudice is a scary thing and it really can change how you look at people.  I would offer him a context in which to put things first.  Movies like....Selma, Lord Selma....The Color of Friendship...Mississippi Burning...Malcolm X....all depending on the age of your child.  I would watch with him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1933690980">I didn&#39;t get to watch many episodes of the show, but &quot;American Dreams&quot; <br/>
had some great exposure to racial intolerance and to the Vietnam War.<br/>
<br/>
The show did have intense relationship stuff going on such as an <br/>
unexpected pregnancy and some drug use. Not sure of the age of your <br/>
son, but it looked like a well done show, from my perspective. <br/>
Obviously, this isn&#39;t a documentary, just a tv drama, so make of it <br/>
what you will. <br/>
<br/>
I &quot;Googled&quot; it and aparently, it is available on DVD. Libraries might <br/>
have it...<br/>

<br/>
My daughter and I watched the movie &quot;Ruby Bridges,&quot; and found it to be<br/>
an excellent resource for discussing racism. (My daughter is 9) I<br/>
highly recommend this movie. Good luck!<br/>

<br/>
Answer his questions.<br/>
<br/>
And try to stop thinking of it as Social Studies. &lt;g&gt; He&#39;s interested in cluture, race relations, and civil rights. School lumps those things together as something they call Social Studies. It could just as easily turn into a conversation about how scientific discovery changed  a culture or art affected race relations.<br/>

If he really wants to talk to them, I&#39;d be sure to be there with him when he does. That way you can help him understand where they are and what helped shape their particular views. <br/>
