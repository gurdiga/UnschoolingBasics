 </span></blockquote>Check out nhen.org for homeschool support groups in your state, many <br/>
times there are unschoolers who belong to these, not just &quot;traditional&quot; <br/>
curriculum etc homeschoolers.   It&#39;s another place to check!   Hope you <br/>
get some responses here.<br/>
<br/>
Also try seaching under the yahoo groups for unschooling plus your <br/>
state, maybe there&#39;s a group (I found one for mine that way).   <br/>
Sometimes you have to search through the results, depending on how you <br/>
word it too.<br/>
