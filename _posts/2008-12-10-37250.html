<div id="ygrps-yiv-2106871094">1) If you want to start a new topic, start with a blank email. DON&#39;T  <br/>
click Reply and then change the subject.<br/>
<br/>
Why? Because if you click Reply, Yahoo and email programs still  <br/>
consider your email part of the thread you clicked Reply on *even if  <br/>
you change the subject*<br/>
<br/>
Your new topic will be stored at Yahoo under the original thread.  <br/>
Email programs will sort it with the original thread. If a new topic  <br/>
is mixed in with a busy thread, it&#39;s not going to get the attention  <br/>
it could.<br/>
<br/>
(I know I am totally guilty of this! ;-)  Clicking Reply is an easy  <br/>
way to get the email program to fill in the address, but most email  <br/>
programs now, if you type a couple of letters of the address, will  <br/>
give you some addresses to choose from.)<br/>
<br/>
2) If the list is busy with one topic, it&#39;s a good idea to wait a day  <br/>
or two until things have died down to introduce another, especially  <br/>
if it&#39;s a topic that people might not have quick answers to.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t get a response, try again in a couple of days.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-165136765">And, put specifics in your subject line. :) What you are looking for:<br/>
help, thoughts, opinions, ideas, advise, etc, etc... will be obvious<br/>
in your message.</div>
