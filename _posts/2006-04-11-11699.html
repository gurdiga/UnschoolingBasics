<div id="ygrps-yiv-2029492668"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; My kids get highlights, but I haven&#39;t seen anything about that<br/>
 </span></blockquote>book....ummmm<br/>
I&#39;m just wondering, do your kids get involved in stuff like sports  or<br/>
4-H?&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I have two dd who are vastly different.  Rachael, our 13yo loves the<br/>
outdoors.  She used to play soccer several years ago and just recently<br/>
mentioned she would like to check into a local soccer group.  We have LOTS<br/>
of animals and Rachael spends most of her days tending to/playing with them.<br/>
We have 4 horses.  Rachael purchased the 4th one with her own money with the<br/>
intention of training and reselling her.  She is doing a really good job<br/>
with it so far.  We also have 2 ducks, a goat, 2 dogs, a cat, 2 hermit crabs<br/>
and a recently adopted baby turtle.<br/>
<br/>
They both just finished a 5-week program at the gym where my dad is a<br/>
member.  They call it Girl Power.  They rock climb, yoga, race, step<br/>
aerobic, swim, and lots of other stuff.  Neither one wanted to sign up for<br/>
the next 5 weeks.  Long story<br/>
<br/>
Madison our 10yo would rather stay inside and not go anywhere.  Recently she<br/>
has started riding her bike more, and playing outside with Rachael more.<br/>
She does love to play with her dog but would be happier if her daddy and I<br/>
would allow her to bring the dog inside to play.  Madison has never been one<br/>
for sports.  We recently bought her a sewing machine.  She loves to sew and<br/>
design the latest fashion in clothing.  Rachael our 13 yo is also an<br/>
incredible artist.  The two of them have worked together on their designs.<br/>
Rachael paints on the jeans and Madison is going to add beading.<br/>
<br/>
We have never done the 4-H thing.  We do go skating on occasion with some<br/>
friends of theirs.<br/>
<br/>
Our family has been through some pretty tough transitions in the last 2<br/>
years.  I think all of us have just enjoyed hibernating for a while.  We are<br/>
slowly coming back out.  As I write this, the girls are piled in our bed<br/>
with my dh watching Shark Attack.  We just recently join Netflix.  I think<br/>
we are really going to enjoy that!<br/>
<br/>
I have noticed lately on the posts that several families stay pretty active<br/>
with activities.  We tend to stay active around home.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-127220627">Tracey, same here.  We&#39;re pretty much home bodies, but thats okay,<br/>
different strokes for different folks.  I&#39;m trying to remember that in<br/>
the days before public schooling people still learned and that was<br/>
before organized sports, libraries and clubs!  LOL  Don&#39;t get me<br/>
wrong, we get out but I&#39;m not even close to being &#39;busy&#39; outside of<br/>
the home.<br/>

Yeah, I have no desire to run about with a bunch of kids, we go to the park  <br/>
and stuff like that, but that&#39;s about all i do out of the home<br/>
