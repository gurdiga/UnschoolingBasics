  What would happen if they never cleaned their rooms?  Not a likely scenario in my 22 yrs experience, and I&#39;ve never forced a child to clean a room.

Someday, they do desire a certain level of cleanliness to their space, and when that happens I&#39;m more than happy to help them get there. <br/>

cleanliness?  I remind them to straighten up.  But they don&#39;t enjoy<br/>
it.  I guess I am reading and seeing a certain &quot;push&quot; towards hedonism<br/>

with me, they would sit doing nothing or just vegging in front of the<br/>
computer or xbox.  I am seeing the value of certain aspects to the<br/>

the times there was &quot;force&quot; involved were exceptions and kind of  <br/>
extreme situations. They happened because something3 unexpected  <br/>
occurred or because I hadn&#39;t planned ahead well enough. They are now  <br/>
16, 20, and 22 and they are awesome - very responsible and  <br/>
accomplished, very nice to be around.<br/>

choices for adults.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I hate doing laundry but it has to<br/>
&gt; &gt; be done.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do you really hate it? That&#39;s strong language, but if it is true that  <br/>
you really truly do hate it, then you could hire someone to do it.  <br/>
Lots of people hire others to do their laundry. But, more  <br/>
importantly, can&#39;t you find joy in it, instead? I have grown to love  <br/>
it by slowing down, paying closer attention, not viewing it as  <br/>
something to just get done, but as a gift I give to my family and  <br/>
myself. Just like I might take care how I wrap a nice gift for  <br/>
someone, I take good care of our clothing. We only buy things we  <br/>
really love. I enjoy taking care of them. My kids and husband do most  <br/>
of their own laundry these days, and they have the same approach as I  <br/>
do, they&#39;re careful with their clothing. It is a great blessing that  <br/>
we have nice clothes, a nice washer and dryer, that we don&#39;t have to  <br/>
go down to the river.....  &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t like exercising but it&#39;s good for me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I LOVE exercising. I hated it for years and tried to force it on  <br/>
myself and I resisted my own attempts. But unschooling changed my  <br/>
mentality and, eventually, that extended to believing that I matter  <br/>
enough to take good care of myself. I started trying all kinds of  <br/>
activities and taking the time to go to nice places, the beach,  <br/>
pretty parks, etc., to go for walks. Now I run - yesterday I ran a  <br/>
10K and I loved every minute of it. The joy of moving our bodies,  <br/>
feeling our muscles work - it is one of the greatest joys of life.  <br/>
Exercise for kids, especially, ought to come about as a result of  <br/>
play, which, by definition ought to be enjoyable. Find something else  <br/>
to do - something you enjoy. You think you&#39;re modeling good habits,  <br/>
but what you&#39;re modeling is that things that are good for you are not  <br/>
enjoyable. That&#39;s such a throwback to a Puritan ethic and a recipe  <br/>
for living a life filled with &quot;have to&#39;s&quot; and &quot;should&#39;s.&quot; You don&#39;t  <br/>
have to live that way, life can be filled, instead, with &quot;I love to.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My kids, never forced to exercise, are all very physically active.  <br/>
Roya hikes and rock climbs when possible, kayaks, swims several times  <br/>
per week, and goes to a karate class twice a week. Roxana dances -  <br/>
tap, ballet, jazz. Rosie plays soccer, takes and teaches karate  <br/>
classes, and takes tap, ballet, jazz, and hip-hop classes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you all<br/>
&gt; &gt; seriously have child run households where what a kid wants trumps  <br/>
&gt; what the<br/>
&gt; &gt; family wants and needs...and even to the detriment of the child?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nope. That isn&#39;t how it works. But I can see why it appears that way,  <br/>
especially since you have the feeling that you have to do things you  <br/>
hate. It would be hard to imagine that kids and adults can have  <br/>
completely different attitudes than that. I can honestly say that I  <br/>
never do anything I hate and that even when I do things because I  <br/>
feel they need to be done, I do them knowing that it is my choice.  <br/>
That changes everything.<br/>
<br/>
There are more times that a parent supports a child&#39;s wants than that  <br/>
a child supports a parent&#39;s wants, for many years. But, that  <br/>
naturally begins to change as the kids get older. My kids are really  <br/>
thoughtful of their dad and me, these days, since they are teens and  <br/>
young adults.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; (Such as a<br/>
&gt; &gt; kid that doesn&#39;t ever want to get exercise.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve never known a young kid who didn&#39;t want to play. They don&#39;t need  <br/>
to &quot;exercise&quot; as in purposely run around a track or do sit-ups or  <br/>
lift weights. They just need support in following their own natural  <br/>
inclinations to be active in ways that give them pleasure.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; That&#39;s a real paradigm shift<br/>
&gt; &gt; for me<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is - try pretending to yourself that it really works and giving it  <br/>
a real serious open-minded look. It isn&#39;t going to hurt, you don&#39;t  <br/>
have to actually change anything, you can think it through even  <br/>
though it sounds risky. There is no harm in thinking dangerous  <br/>
thoughts. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and I don&#39;t think I want a &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; rule in my house.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We definitely do not have that. The kids and adults are partners and  <br/>
work together, play together, live together mostly happily and  <br/>
collaboratively.<br/>
<br/>
What I didn&#39;t want was an &quot;us versus them&quot; feeling in my house. I  <br/>
didn&#39;t want my kids thinking things like:<br/>
<br/>
She is so mean. She doesn&#39;t understand. She doesn&#39;t care about MY  <br/>
feelings. She doesn&#39;t care what &quot;I&quot; want. She cares about the stupid  <br/>
house more than about me.<br/>
<br/>
Those are all things kids have going in their heads when their  <br/>
parents think they are being very reasonable in forcing them to do  <br/>
housework, for example.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; Really?  Seriously?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Really, seriously on the &quot;forcing&quot; part. Its possible to have <br/>
relationships with children that don&#39;t include bigger people forcing <br/>
littler people to do things. Its challenging and takes a Lot more in <br/>
the way of skills, but that&#39;s one of the reasons this and other <br/>
unschooling boards exist - to help parents learn those skills. <br/>
<br/>
Some of those skills are conceptual, as I mentioned in another post. <br/>
Learning to understand behavior as communication is pretty <br/>
conceptual, and takes a good deal of practice, but it can make a <br/>
Huge difference in a family. It has in mine. Learning to think of <br/>
kids as partners rather than unfinished products is also pretty <br/>
conceptual - and one of the core principles of whole life <br/>
unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
Do you all<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; seriously have child run households where what a kid wants <br/>
 </span></blockquote>trumps what the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; family wants and needs...and even to the detriment of the child?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, here&#39;s another - what my family wants and needs is based in <br/>
part on what my kids want and need. A big part of my job involves <br/>
valuing my kids&#39; wants and needs and trying to help them get those <br/>
met - which is pretty tricky with a highly verbal, extroverted <br/>
teenager *and* a highly visual, introverted 6yo. Part of the <br/>
concepual work of unschooling is believing that its possible for <br/>
every member of the family to feel honored and valued - and &quot;the <br/>
family&quot; is honored and valued, too. Its not an either-or situation, <br/>
its an &quot;and&quot; situation.<br/>
<br/>
One of the things that helped me, early on, was thinking about my <br/>
principles, or if you prefer, core values. And then thinking about <br/>
how I could live by those values - but not necessarily Impose them <br/>
on my kids.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; We all have to do things we don&#39;t want to do.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Would you rather your kids did unpleasant things out of a sense of <br/>
kindness and mutual support or duty? <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve been forcing your kids to do things, rather than giving <br/>
and asking and respecting and supporting, its likely that they do <br/>
those things grudgingly - which supports your &quot;need&quot; to force the <br/>
issue. There isn&#39;t much basis on anyone&#39;s part to trust that family <br/>
members can act out of generosity and thoughtfullness. Changing that <br/>
situation would have to begin with *more* generosity and <br/>
thoughtfullness on your part. It would likely be a disaster if you <br/>
just dropped all your &quot;have tos&quot; at once - but you *can* start <br/>
saying more &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;I&#39;ll help&quot; and &quot;how can I make this easier on <br/>
you?&quot;. You can start showing *more* of the kindness you&#39;d like to <br/>
see in the world.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m forcing my kids to keep their rooms clean.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It isn&#39;t necessary to force them. You have a whole lot of other <br/>
options available. You can offer to help them clean. You can offer <br/>
to clean the rooms for them (and I mean clean, not pitch all their <br/>
stuff out of frustration). You can ask that they keep the doors <br/>
shut. You can ask that they not bring food in there. You can <br/>
acknowledge that keeping their rooms clean is your issue, not <br/>
theirs. <br/>
<br/>
Neither of my kids is a neat-freak by any stretch of the <br/>
imagination, but in the last week both of them cleaned their rooms. <br/>
One asked for physical help, the other for suggestions. They don&#39;t <br/>
clean their rooms every week - its not that important to either of <br/>
them - but they do periodically decide &quot;y&#39;know, my life would be <br/>
easier if my room were picked up&quot; and voila! <br/>
<br/>
Right this moment, as I&#39;m typing, my stepson is washing dishes. Its <br/>
something he&#39;s happy to do, but he rarely does it without being <br/>
asked. So we ask. We try to ask when he&#39;s not obviously in the <br/>
middle of something - and when we do, he&#39;s happy to do it right <br/>
then. Otherwise, he&#39;s likely to say &quot;when I&#39;m done/at a stopping <br/>
point&quot; - and since I&#39;d like him to be able to finish the things he <br/>
starts, I respect that. <br/>
<br/>
Periodically one of my kids asks me to help with a project I&#39;m not <br/>
thrilled about. If I&#39;m not in the middle of something more important <br/>
(and there&#39;s not much in that category... cooking and peeing come to <br/>
mind) I&#39;ll help out as best I can, because generosity and mutual <br/>
support are important to me. That&#39;s what I mean by &quot;living my <br/>
principles without imposing them&quot; - I can create a more generous <br/>
family environment by Being more generous.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I&#39;m making them get exercise. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, there are options besides force. Maybe you need to figure out <br/>
how to think outside the box a bit more in terms of helping them <br/>
find things they like to do that let them move their bodies. An <br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I don&#39;t like exercising but it&#39;s good for me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It helps, from an unschooling perspective, to see *everything* you <br/>
do as a choice. You *choose* to exercise. You&#39;ve chosen a type of <br/>
exercise you dislike for reasons that seem good to you. <br/>
<br/>
Now see that your children, also, have choices - right now maybe <br/>
their choices are to do what mom wants or resist - can you give them <br/>
More Choices? Can you help them see the world in terms of options <br/>
and possiblities rather than duties and limits? <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I don&#39;t think I want a &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; rule in my house.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Who would? <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling tends to be a bit messier and less convenient in the <br/>
short run than telling kids what to do and when, but its a loooooong <br/>
way away from &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;. I&#39;m trying to help my kids <br/>
understand their own needs and wants and motivations and not just <br/>
react to those. That looks really different between my two kids in <br/>
some ways, but both have an understanding that I&#39;m here as a <br/>
resource for them, not an obstacle to get around or an authority to <br/>
defy. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-164565897">How am I forcing the cleanliness? I remind them to straighten up. But they don&#39;t enjoy<br/>
it. I guess I am reading and seeing a certain &quot;push&quot; towards hedonism in children. Perhaps I&#39;m seeing it wrong.<br/>
<br/>
  *****<br/>
  well, force was your word, not mine &lt;g&gt; <br/>
   <br/>
  Are you reading that we *push* towards hedonism?  Which, btw, isn&#39;t the evil word my Dad made it sound like.  <br/>
  From dictionary.com Hedonism -- the doctirne that pleasure or happiness is the highest good.<br/>
   <br/>
  Is there really a higher good than happiness?  Is life good if one&#39;s not happy?  Not in my paradigm. <br/>
   <br/>
  **Well they have pets in there and that means that they have to keep a certain level of cleanliness so the pets are happy and healthy. If I let them pile stuff to the ceiling they the pets would suffer for it. And they need the fresh air so door closing can&#39;t be common. <br/>
   <br/>
  ****<br/>
  there are no air vents in your kids&#39; bedrooms? no windows? A closed door doesn&#39;t necessarily mean no fresh air.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Maybe it&#39;s time to have a talk about the pets -- are the kids really capable of the care required? Are they willing to do the work?  Are you if the kids aren&#39;t? What kind of pets are we talking about and how old are your kids?  If you&#39;ve had the talk about pets and cleanliness -- and everyone is on the same page about what pet care requires, then is anyone being forced, or are you representing yourself unfairly?   <br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
  *****<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m making them get exercise.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; *****<br/>
&gt; again, how and to what gain? Would they really never get ANY exercise unless you forced them? Never play a game of tag, or go out into the yard, climb a tree, ride a bike unless forced?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>**riding a bike once a week is not fitness...it is not enough.<br/>
Minimum of 30 mins physical activity per day is reccommended. And yes, there are days where if I didn&#39;t nudge them out the door, usually with me, they would sit doing nothing or just vegging in front of the computer or xbox. I am seeing the value of certain aspects to the<br/>
games they play on screen but gosh they need to be strong. They need to be healthy. I don&#39;t want them to fight with being fat as I have had to my whole life.<br/>
   <br/>
  ****<br/>
  Did someone force you to exercise 30 minutes a day?  Are your kids overweight?  I come from a family of fat people.  I&#39;m overweight myself.  I have three children -- the oldest is stick-skinny no matter what he eats or how little he *exercises*; the middle child has always been a solid/heavy kid and he&#39;s learning better habits now at 11, and losing weight (without force, btw); the youngest is an all around healthy kid, a born athlete and a much more likely to eat a balanced diet than his brothers.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I grew up with all my meal portions controlled (no dessert once I was 13, as I was getting too *hippy*), we ate only Roman Meal bread (never white) and the only cereal we were allowed was Total (with only one spoon of sugar added); I was forced to participate in sports and get *regular exercise.* It benefited me and my sibs not at all -- we were the 20-somethings roaming the grocery store with a cartful of Cap&#39;n Crunch, Wonder bread and Coke.  I hated all *exercise* and still really don&#39;t enjoy sports.  All the controlling did was make me intent that when I was on my own, I&#39;d do (or not do) and eat (or not eat) exactly and ONLY what I WANTED -- that anything my parents told me I needed was suspect and to be avoided.  After all, they didn&#39;t trust me to make good choices, why should I listen to or trust them? <br/>
   <br/>
  *****<br/>
Is your home *monopolized* with your stuff -- furniture you chose, artwork you like?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*** well yes and no. We live in a small space and I can not see how allowing one of them to drop some creation in the middle of the living room and it being sacrosanct and off limits to touch is a good thing.I have &quot;stuff&quot; too but it&#39;s not in the middle of the floor. Additionally, I have dogs and cats and will be bringing a 3 yr old home from China soon. Their things can&#39;t have more value than those of everyone else.<br/>
   <br/>
  ****<br/>
  But do their things have less value than your things? <br/>
   <br/>
  If the space you live in is too small for dogs, cats, bedroom pets, your own current children, an incoming 3yo and two adults, then maybe it&#39;s time to re-negotiate how the family&#39;s space is being used.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1988776961">The kids are not going to literally pile stuff to the ceiling and the  <br/>
pets truly won&#39;t care if the floor, desk, dresser, and bed are  <br/>
covered with stuff. You&#39;re the one who cares.<br/>
<br/>
As the family makes the decision to keep pets in the bedroom, we talk  <br/>
about how it is all going to work out. I don&#39;t say, &quot;...with that  <br/>
decision comes the responsibility of having to keep a clean room,&quot;  <br/>
because that truly is not the case. The question can be broader - if  <br/>
we have pets in the bedroom, what is the best way to make sure  <br/>
they&#39;re well cared for?<br/>
<br/>
We have a parakeet that has lived in our living room for the past  <br/>
four months while my daughter was working for the summer in Alaska  <br/>
(we&#39;re in Southern California). She wants to move it back into her  <br/>
room. We just had this discussion where I said, &quot;If you leave it out  <br/>
here, I&#39;ll remember to help take care of it, but if it is back there  <br/>
in your room, I won&#39;t think of it as often. That means you have to be  <br/>
a lot more careful with feeding and watering, etc.&quot; She said, &quot;Yeah,  <br/>
I know and I will.&quot; I said, &quot;There are lots of times you go away for  <br/>
weekends and stuff, so you&#39;re not here to care for it. I usually  <br/>
always change the water and feed it, then.&quot; I also said, &quot;Out here in  <br/>
the living room, there is more activity for it and I think parakeets  <br/>
like that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
No decision made yet, so I&#39;m not sure if she&#39;s going to move it or  <br/>
not.  I hope not because I like it out here - it makes sweet little  <br/>
noises, provides lots of entertainment, and I don&#39;t mind cleaning up  <br/>
the mess it makes.<br/>
<br/>
My point is that this isn&#39;t any different than the kind of discussion  <br/>
I would have had with her when she was 10 years old, but she&#39;s now  <br/>
22. The difference is that now I know that she will take care of it  <br/>
if she does put it into her room, whereas when she was 10, she&#39;d have  <br/>
been very likely to forget for days, and I would have been a lot more  <br/>
careful to provide backup support. Otherwise, same conversation.<br/>

**********************<br/>
<br/>
Having more family members and/or less space creates some &quot;natural <br/>
limits&quot; that don&#39;t exist in other families, for sure. Here&#39;s a <br/>
thought, though, if one child in the family was particularly <br/>
musical, wouldn&#39;t you work to support that, even if it were <br/>
sometimes inconvenient? How about a child who was an avid painter on <br/>
a fairly large scale - would you try to create some space for that <br/>
child to work and also space to display it? It would be a good thing <br/>
to involve the other kids in that kind of decision making, <br/>
certainly, and there would likely be more and different compromises <br/>
than in a family with an only child.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Their things can&#39;t have more value than those<br/>
&gt; of everyone else. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This statement goes beyond &quot;things&quot; I think. Its important that <br/>
family members feel honored and valued. That being said, some kids <br/>
have more/higher needs than others. Denying that neediness, though, <br/>
doesn&#39;t really create a situation where other family members feel as <br/>
though their needs are being honored - more likely a sense of <br/>
competition for limited resources. Helping everyone in the family <br/>
have a sense of abundance can be a challenge. Is that the sort of <br/>
thing you&#39;re concerned about? Do you feel &quot;stretched&quot; as a parent? <br/>
perhaps some others could share how they moved from feeling like <br/>
there &quot;wasn&#39;t enough mom to go around&quot; to a sense of abundant <br/>
support.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I&#39;m not saying others can&#39;t do this...just trying<br/>
&gt; to grasp the totality of this system.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d call unschooling a &quot;system&quot; since it depends so <br/>
heavily on specific circumstances. Its more a set of guidelines for <br/>
building more open relationships and improving communication within <br/>
a family. Insisting that family members do things a particular way <br/>
shuts down communication and erodes relationships. Finding ways to <br/>
support the passions of individual family members with full regard <br/>
to the needs and passions of *other* family members helps improve <br/>
relationships and involves a whole lot of communication. <br/>
<br/>
What that actually &quot;looks like&quot; is pretty diverse. I don&#39;t <br/>
communicate with my 6yo the same way I communicate with my 14yo - <br/>
and that&#39;s just within my one small family!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-667069887">I think the difference between reroofing the house and asking my kids not to<br/>
fight with each other is immense.  What I am talking about are those things<br/>
that we all must do in life to get along and get by.  Not to demand more<br/>
than others have.  Not to take without giving.  Not to feed the selfish<br/>
parts of us all the time.<br/>
<br/>
Upon further reflection I don&#39;t believe that it&#39;s OK for anyone to always<br/>
say no all the time.  If a police officer asks you to pull over you may not<br/>
say no.  If my oldest son is being an ass to his little brother and hurting<br/>
his feelings it is NOT ok for him to say NO to me when I tell him to stop.<br/>
I guess (and I recognize this is a new shift in my thinking required) that I<br/>
am reading a lot (not here necessarily) where unschooling has become<br/>
&quot;child-kings&quot; and that is abdication of parenting.  Children can be treated<br/>
with respect and kindness without given free-reign to impact the family and<br/>
world as they see fit regardless of age or motivation.  What I am struggling<br/>
with is what I see as parents giving up guiding children and allowing<br/>
children to guide everything.  Works I guess when you have only one child<br/>
but how can I allow one child to rule when I have more than one?  How can I<br/>
look at my youngest and say &quot;Your brother is teasing you but that&#39;s what he<br/>
feels like doing now.  You have to allow it because that&#39;s what he wants.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I suppose the question I have is what do you do when conflict comes as it<br/>
envitably will?<br/>

<br/>
The question still stands: If you ask your child to do something, can  <br/>
the child say no and you&#39;ll be okay with that?<br/>
<br/>
Nothing about always say no. It&#39;s just common courtesy that when you  <br/>
ask someone to do you a favor, you need to be okay with no. If you&#39;re  <br/>
not okay with no, then you aren&#39;t asking. You&#39;re disguising a command  <br/>
as a question. And if you don&#39;t see it as a favor you&#39;re asking, then  <br/>
you&#39;ve imposed an obligation on them and, again, it&#39;s not a question.  <br/>
It&#39;s just a command.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s an important behavioral observation. Do you treat your kids by a  <br/>
different set of courtesy rules than you do adults? Are there adults  <br/>
you ask questions of that you wouldn&#39;t accept no from?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
**Well Joyce I had kind of hoped that I could ask questions here<br/>
without being attacked but that is sadly not the case.<br/>
<br/>
There is insistance on this list that children be allowed to do<br/>
whatever, whenever, however, they want and parents are obligated to<br/>
change their expectations or way they view that.  Just in this thread.<br/>
 I asked about exercise and was told that my kids shouldn&#39;t be asked<br/>
to do any.  They should be left to their own devices and they will<br/>
come to it naturally.  That my insistance on doing some for my health<br/>
and theirs will envitably lead to them hating it...ergo against the<br/>
philosophy.  There is another thread here about some gigantic Lego<br/>
creations which the child has forbid the mother to remove, move, or<br/>
alter.  All responses seem to point to the parents learning to live<br/>
around these things.<br/>
<br/>
I asked about that and did people really think children should be<br/>
allowed to leave their stuff all over the house and was told that I<br/>
had monopolized my house with my stuff so the children should be<br/>
allowed the same rights.  To expect otherwise is against the<br/>
philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
If I am told that children should not be asked to do chores, to clean<br/>
their rooms, to exercise, or in any other way help the family, then I<br/>
have to assume this is rule by children.  What other assumption can<br/>
there be?  Some have said they ask but do not expect the children to<br/>
do any thing but usually they will when they get around to it.  But<br/>
most have told me to ask is to disrespect.  No Joyce, not direct<br/>
quotes but that&#39;s the gist of it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What people have written may sound that way but you are dead wrong.<br/>
&gt; You will get far better answers if you ask questions about what&#39;s<br/>
&gt; confusing you rather than insisting your vision of what&#39;s going on in<br/>
&gt; our homes is better than our own vision.<br/>
<br/>
**At NO time did I ever say my vision was better than yours.  What you<br/>
do with your kids in your home is your business. I am asking what is<br/>
being advocated.  It&#39;s a simple question.  What is the position of the<br/>
philosophy re: children and who says and does what when?  I also said,<br/>
Joyce, that I read not just here but other places as well, and that my<br/>
information is coming from multiple sources, BUT the overarching<br/>
message is &quot;Do not insist, force, coerce nor even ask a child to do<br/>
anything because that is against the philosophy.&quot;  So I asked...and<br/>
while most people answered nicely, you have been less so.<br/>
<br/>
I understand that you probably grow tired of answering the same<br/>
questions over and over again but if you didn&#39;t want to answer...you<br/>
could have just deleted my post.  I am simply trying to wrap my head<br/>
around something that is foreign to me.  I *thought* I had a grasp of<br/>
the concept until it came to my attention that this is more than just<br/>
about learning it&#39;s is a part of all interactions with children.  This<br/>
boggles my mind.<br/>
<br/>
FWIW Joyce, I am a behaviorist and work with aggressive animals for a<br/>
living.  I understand behavior as communication.   I understand the 8<br/>
ways to change a behavior.  I understand and use opperant conditioning<br/>
in my life daily.  I am not stupid nor am I incapable of grasping<br/>
esoteric concepts.  I am familiar with &quot;bucking the system&quot; as I feed<br/>
my pets a biologically appropriate diet and they have minimal<br/>
interference with their immune systems.  So please do me the favor of<br/>
not being disrespectful or patronizing to me.  I am simply trying to<br/>
grasp the concept so it can be applied correctly.  What is wrong with<br/>
that?<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The question still stands: If you ask your child to do something, can<br/>
&gt; the child say no and you&#39;ll be okay with that?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Nothing about always say no. It&#39;s just common courtesy that when you<br/>
&gt; ask someone to do you a favor, you need to be okay with no. If you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; not okay with no, then you aren&#39;t asking. You&#39;re disguising a command<br/>
&gt; as a question. And if you don&#39;t see it as a favor you&#39;re asking, then<br/>
&gt; you&#39;ve imposed an obligation on them and, again, it&#39;s not a question.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s just a command.<br/>
<br/>
**And this would be against the philosophy yes?  One must never give<br/>
their child a command and only ask favors but be prepared for that<br/>
favor to be declined.  Is that what you are saying because that&#39;s the<br/>
way it reads.  And so I look at that and see that child-kings.  If I&#39;m<br/>
wrong and there is something other option then please enlighten me<br/>
because I&#39;m trying to understand how this actually looks.  Theory is<br/>
nice but practical application is better.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2076580793">You said it was a simple question, but I don&#39;t think it is simple at <br/>
all.  I think the questions can be answered in many more ways than <br/>
just yes or no. There is a lot to be said in between forcing and <br/>
doing nothing.  <br/>
<br/>
For example, with the exercise question.  There are a lot of ways to <br/>
encourage your child to be physically active.  People often use the <br/>
example of what if your spouse asked you to do what you ask your <br/>
kids to do.  If my husband said, &quot;You need to get some exercise.  <br/>
Why don&#39;t you go for a bike ride for 30 minutes today?&quot;  I&#39;d most <br/>
likely want to respond with not just &quot;NO&quot; but &quot;Hell no! I can decide <br/>
for myself if I want some exercise.&quot;  However, if he said, &quot;I know <br/>
what would be fun!  Let&#39;s go for a bike ride after I get home.  I <br/>
know a really cool place to ride.&quot;  Wow.  It sounds fun now.  But, I <br/>
could still say no and would say no if there was something that I <br/>
would much rather be doing or if I don&#39;t really like bike riding.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, this other part about rule by children or child-kings, I really <br/>
don&#39;t understand.  What do you mean by children ruling?  Ruling <br/>
you?  How?  Ruling themselves?<br/>
<br/>
What I am hearing from people here is that what children want is <br/>
important too, not that what we as parents want is not important.  <br/>
It is generally accepted in our culture that the projects of <br/>
children are not very important, and if a child leaves a lot of <br/>
legos on the floor, parents are fully justified in just scooping <br/>
them up to get them out of the way.  After all, it&#39;s just toys.  But <br/>
to a child, destroying that lego project may be comparable to <br/>
someone stomping on a painting you just finished or throwing a <br/>
lovely meal you prepared into the trash.<br/>
<br/>
We aren&#39;t saying do nothing and say nothing.  We are saying that <br/>
what is important to you may not be important to your child.  We are <br/>
saying talk to your children if something is bothering you, and if <br/>
it&#39;s important to you that they do something, ask yourself why and <br/>
let them know why.  <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t have time for more now but wish I did.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1551992636">There was a whole lot in your post, but I&#39;m going to just address  <br/>
this. i feel like because I have seven kids, I&#39;m pretty much a mommy  <br/>
moderator with lots of experience in conflict. rotfl....<br/>
<br/>
i think the question you have to ask is why is the conflict there?  <br/>
Why would an older child pick on a younger child? What is he getting  <br/>
out of it? What does that older child need in order to stop? Instead  <br/>
of just saying &quot;NO!&quot;, which just gets him to stop until you are out  <br/>
of the scene (trust me, not only grew up with that, but also have  <br/>
seen it in my own children) and builds resentment, what else can you  <br/>
say? Once you look at why the behavior is happening, then you can  <br/>
look at what will work to increase respect for each other.<br/>
<br/>
Viewing it as the older brother being &#39;an ass&#39; presents a lot of  <br/>
negative views of the child, and probably perpetuates that behavior.  <br/>
Sometimes the little brother is really asking for it ;-)  Seriously,  <br/>
when my 12 yo is picking on a younger sibling, it&#39;s often because he  <br/>
feels out of control in a situation. We&#39;re driving somewhere and he  <br/>
doesn&#39;t have anything else to do. All the computers are being used  <br/>
and he&#39;s run out of library books. He&#39;s hungry and doesn&#39;t realize  <br/>
his blood sugar is low, so it is appealing to his chemistry. So i can  <br/>
offer things. i can offer snacks to boost his energy and blood sugar.  <br/>
I can offer his some books from my collection. In the car I will ask  <br/>
him to find a different radio station that he likes, or maybe we&#39;ll  <br/>
put in on the news and discuss what&#39;s going on. I&#39;ll find something  <br/>
that&#39;s appealing to his 12 yo body and mind as being difficult, he  <br/>
personally enjoys the two mile hike to the grocery store, so I&#39;ll  <br/>
mention that we&#39;re out of such-n-so and see if he wants to go. I have  <br/>
a mental checklist of things he likes to do, and I&#39;ll ask if he minds  <br/>
climbing into the attic and checking the vents for AC leaks, or  <br/>
cutting up firewood, or digging through our old CDROMS to see which  <br/>
ones are compatible with our newest software. KWIM?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying that you should tell your little one that he has to  <br/>
put up with being teased, I have learned to step back and ask &quot;Hey!  <br/>
What&#39;s going on in here?&quot; and listening and figuring out what&#39;s  <br/>
REALLY going on. Beyond the conflict, what has really instigated  <br/>
this? Sometimes big brothers just need a break. can he stay home  <br/>
while you take the younger ones shopping? Can you take him once a  <br/>
week out for an ice cream cone while someone watches the younger  <br/>
kids. It really helps all of my kids to hear lots of stories of how  <br/>
precious they were when they were younger. Not as a &quot;You did this  <br/>
when YOU were four, get over it.&quot; But all the time, outside of the  <br/>
situation. Driving to the mall, &quot;You know, I remember this one time,  <br/>
when you were four, you did x, y, z. Sam reminds me so much of you at  <br/>
that age.&quot; Then he might complain a bit about how Sam is always in  <br/>
his face and wanting a,b,c, and I&#39;ll listen and say &quot;Yes, your uncle  <br/>
Chris was the same way when we were little. It&#39;s hard to deal with  <br/>
that much energy.&quot; But Josh especially seems to be softer and more  <br/>
gentle on things that he knows is usual for all little kids, and so  <br/>
we really try to keep that open. We talk about those traits in  <br/>
positive manners, talk about where it got him.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe this will help some, I sensed a lot of fear of the unknown in  <br/>
your post, and maybe some of that black and white thinking, it has to  <br/>
be this or that, rather than reading between the lines and finding  <br/>
alternatives.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1031115921">One question....first of all, i&#39;m sorry that your self-image is  <br/>
suffering, you see yourself as fighting fat. I feel that way, not as  <br/>
often as I used to, because I&#39;m so blessed to have this struggle to  <br/>
save my own children from it. One thing I had to ask myself is &quot;Did I  <br/>
have an unschooling background where I was making choices, or was my  <br/>
food and exercise legislated? Which one led to me being overweight?&quot;  <br/>
I can assure you it wasn&#39;t freedom of choice. That&#39;s one reason why  <br/>
it is very important to *me* for my kids to choose these things of  <br/>
their own free will, because I still remember the first year, living  <br/>
on my own, I was still skinny, but I was choosing all that junk food  <br/>
that I either was not allowed to have, or had to have stipulations  <br/>
attached. I stopped exercising because before then it was always  <br/>
legislated by school, or by mom (get out and do something, anything!)  <br/>
so suddenly I could sit and watch Maury all day, eating my dang  <br/>
twinkies, the whole box if I wanted. ack! How long did it take me to  <br/>
gain all that weight? Not long at all!<br/>
<br/>
We started unschooling two years ago. The first day my son had the  <br/>
Wii, he spent 14 hours on it. I didn&#39;t even keep track, i didn&#39;t want  <br/>
to know (he showed me later how to find the tracker on the  <br/>
gamesystem....omg) But by six months later, there were several days  <br/>
in a row that it wasn&#39;t even turned on. What were they doing? Oh,  <br/>
some of it was playing on the internet, but some of it was spent  <br/>
building a tree house, or hiking with the scouts, or digging up the  <br/>
potatoes. My son, whom I worried over because he&#39;s such a bookworm,  <br/>
has spent two or three hours every day this past week trying to beat  <br/>
out his own score on the pogo stick. Talk about exercise! I really  <br/>
think that once the TV and videogames get their fill, when the kids  <br/>
honestly and truly believe that they can come and go from them  <br/>
without stipulation, then the ability to walk away and choose other  <br/>
things are much easier.<br/>
<br/>
I read someone else&#39;s post about making an entire lifestyle change.  <br/>
That is huge. Being able to say, as a mom, I&#39;d like to spend time  <br/>
with you doing x or y, what do you think? and then YOU do it. If they  <br/>
don&#39;t want to go, don&#39;t make it an issue. You get out and have fun  <br/>
and exercise and feel good. They&#39;ll join you when they are ready. My  <br/>
friend walks with her girls, they walk four miles a day...to a frozen  <br/>
custard stand! They have a good time talking, there&#39;s a reward at the  <br/>
end, and they are building a routine with exercise. They don&#39;t go  <br/>
every day, but often enough that the girls don&#39;t mind missing if  <br/>
their walk curves to go by the pond rather than to the shopping  <br/>
center. Cool for them.<br/>

hands-on attentive attachment parenting. We parent by principles,  <br/>
rather than by rules. Thinking about that might help you get it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You have this idea that our kids are wild little brats and we just  <br/>
ignore them or stand around beaming at them? Kind of picturing us as  <br/>
the Dursley-parents of the Harry Potter books?<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t at all like that - let go of that picture because you&#39;re way  <br/>
off.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What I am struggling<br/>

&gt; children to guide everything.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We do a LOT of guiding. Lots and lots.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Works I guess when you have only one child<br/>
&gt; but how can I allow one child to rule when I have more than one?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We don&#39;t allow any child to rule and we don&#39;t rule either. You see  <br/>
things as if someone has to be in control and if it is not the parent  <br/>
being the dictator, it must be the child? Not so. We&#39;re partners, we  <br/>
work together, it is a dance that we do and sometimes one leads,  <br/>
sometimes the other.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How can I<br/>
&gt; look at my youngest and say &quot;Your brother is teasing you but that&#39;s  <br/>

&gt; wants.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That would be ridiculously mean-spirited. Do you seriously think we&#39;d  <br/>
do that?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I suppose the question I have is what do you do when conflict comes  <br/>
&gt; as it<br/>
&gt; envitably will?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Depends on the situation. We have a guiding principle - everyone  <br/>
deserves to be safe in their own house. If older brother is being  <br/>
mean because he&#39;s tired and hungry, I&#39;d probably say, &quot;Hey, let&#39;s go  <br/>
get some food.&quot; If the younger one has been irritating him for a  <br/>
while, I might distract the younger one in some way so that older  <br/>
brother can have some space from him. Maybe they need to get outdoors  <br/>
for a while. Maybe I&#39;ve been too busy elsewhere and they need me to  <br/>
read them both a good story or cuddle up on the couch with some  <br/>
popcorn and watch a movie. I&#39;m not going to ignore it if one kid is  <br/>
being mean to the other, though. Sometimes I might just straight out  <br/>
ask him to come with me to another room and hug him and look deep  <br/>
into his eyes and say, &quot;You&#39;re having a rough time, what&#39;s up?&quot; There  <br/>
is always the assumption that the kid wants happiness and harmony in  <br/>
the family - he wants to be loved, he wants to be happy. So my job is  <br/>
to help him get back in touch with that and to help him understand  <br/>
his own behavior, understand why he&#39;s being mean, understand if there  <br/>
were warning signs that he could have noticed in time to have done  <br/>
something different, and so on. Far from ignoring our kids&#39;  <br/>
behaviors, we pay close attention and fine tune our sensitivity to  <br/>
understand them best we can and develop a really close relationship  <br/>
so that we can give them as much help as possible.<br/>

*really* saying.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Just in this thread.<br/>
&gt; I asked about exercise and was told that my kids shouldn&#39;t be asked<br/>
&gt; to do any.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If your goal is short term to get kids to exercise today, then making  <br/>
them exercise today will work.<br/>
<br/>
If your goal is long term exercise for life there are four possible  <br/>
outcomes of forced exercise when the kids are grown:<br/>
<br/>
1) some kids, because those particular kids were born with an innate  <br/>
love of some kind of physical activity, will enjoy pursuing that  <br/>
activity. (Not all kids are born with that.)<br/>
<br/>
2) some kids, because they fear being out of shape, will force  <br/>
themselves to exercise.<br/>
<br/>
3) some kids who would have enjoyed some kind of physical activity  <br/>
will be so turned off by being made to exercise, be turned off by the  <br/>
negative associations they&#39;ve had with activity, that they&#39;ll rebel  <br/>
and do the opposite.<br/>
<br/>
4) some kids who aren&#39;t drawn to physical activity, but who might  <br/>
have found something they enjoy, will avoid it just because they have  <br/>
negative associations with it and can finally avoid it.<br/>
<br/>
Is the only solution then to let them be? No. And if you assume that  <br/>
must be so, then the answers won&#39;t make sense.<br/>
<br/>
*Unschoolers* goal is to be our children&#39;s partners not their  <br/>
masters. Kids *do* want to be healthy. But they, like all humans,  <br/>
don&#39;t want someone to force them to go through the motions of doing  <br/>
something that someone else thinks will make them healthy.<br/>
<br/>
What do unschoolers do instead?<br/>
<br/>
Instead of exercising we do active things and invite the kids to  <br/>
join. Yes, they can say no, but when we&#39;re offering things they enjoy  <br/>
(and actively seeking out new things to find things they enjoy), they  <br/>
won&#39;t say no often.<br/>
<br/>
The offers can be bike rides, walks through the woods, climbing  <br/>
rocks, rock wall climbing, sports teams, swimming, horseback riding  <br/>
and so on.<br/>
<br/>
If your goal is 30 minutes of exercise per day then unschooling won&#39;t  <br/>
help you achieve that any more than it will help some parent achieve  <br/>
30 minutes of math a day.<br/>
<br/>
If your goal is kids who appreciate the wide variety of ways they can  <br/>
keep active, who have pleasant associations with being active, then  <br/>
we can help you.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; All responses seem to point to the parents learning to live<br/>
&gt; around these things.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you filter the responses through the idea that either kids get  <br/>
their way or adults get their way then the answers are going to sound  <br/>
like we&#39;re saying kids get their way.<br/>
<br/>
There is a *third* option. The third option is finding a way for  <br/>
everyone to get their needs met. It&#39;s seeing children&#39;s needs not as  <br/>
more important but as just as important as adult needs. It *does*  <br/>
take more work but it doesn&#39;t have the downsides of force.<br/>
<br/>
The conventional route is for the parent to decide on a solution and  <br/>
impose the solution on the child.<br/>
<br/>
The mindful parenting route is to step back and see the big picture.  <br/>
How can I help my child get what he wants *and* get what I want? How  <br/>
can I model how to solve problems when two needs seem to clash?<br/>
<br/>
Nearly all of us were raised by parents who modeled for us that the  <br/>
way to get our needs met is to be bigger and make the other person do  <br/>
what we want. That&#39;s why most people have problems understanding that  <br/>
a problem *doesn&#39;t* need to be one person winning and the other losing.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not about winning and losing. It&#39;s not about making someone else  <br/>
give up some of what they have so another person can get what they  <br/>
want. It&#39;s about seeing solutions where everyone&#39;s needs are met and  <br/>
no one loses.<br/>
<br/>
It means seeing beyond the immediate problem. The child with the  <br/>
Legos doesn&#39;t want them all over the house. That&#39;s just the solution  <br/>
he&#39;s hit on to preserve them. He needs help, not force. If mom comes  <br/>
swooping in and sees his solution as the problem and tries to  <br/>
eliminate his solution he&#39;s going to hang onto it! It&#39;s the only way  <br/>
he sees to get what he wants.<br/>
<br/>
The solution is to help him figure out what he *really* wants. (His  <br/>
creations preserved apparently.) The solution is to respectfully help  <br/>
him find solutions where everyone&#39;s needs are met.<br/>
<br/>
When children&#39;s wants and needs and desires are treated with respect  <br/>
as though they mattered to us, then they will (as they&#39;re able) treat  <br/>
our wants and needs and desires with respect.<br/>
<br/>
If the child&#39;s creations are swept away in order for mom to meet her  <br/>
needs, what problem solving method has the mom modeled for him? That  <br/>
might makes right? That being big is better than being small? That  <br/>
making someone do what you want them to is the best way to get your  <br/>
needs met? That when he is able to sweep someone else&#39;s bothersome  <br/>
need out of the way that he should do so?<br/>
<br/>
And what&#39;s the child&#39;s likely reaction? We *want* it to be &quot;Oh, yeah,  <br/>
I was being rude. Mom&#39;s right.&quot; How often *is* that your reaction  <br/>
when someone has trampled all over your needs? Kids are no different.  <br/>
They&#39;re going to be angry. They&#39;re going to feel like they aren&#39;t  <br/>
understood and that the only person who cares about their needs is  <br/>
themselves so they&#39;d better fight to hold onto what they have or it&#39;s  <br/>
going to be taken away by force.<br/>
<br/>
If the mom treats the child&#39;s need to keep his Lego creations with  <br/>
respect, she&#39;s modeling respect. When the situation is not treated  <br/>
like there needs to be losers for there to be winners, there&#39;s no  <br/>
need for kids to fight to hold onto what  they have. They *will* give  <br/>
when they know mom keeps their needs at the top of her priority list.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; That my insistance on doing some for my health<br/>
&gt; and theirs will envitably lead to them hating it...ergo against the<br/>
&gt; philosophy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The goal is peaceful joyful family lives not living by the rule of  <br/>
the philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
Child-kings are not joyful. Parent-kings are not joyful either.<br/>
<br/>
Mindful parenting is a route to no kings at all. It&#39;s a route to  <br/>
partners.<br/>
<br/>
If you can drop the idea that we&#39;re advocating child rule, if you can  <br/>
see that we&#39;re trying to *model* cooperative living (not *impose*  <br/>
cooperative living solutions which is just back to force) and *model*  <br/>
problem solving that takes *everyone&#39;s* feelings into consideration  <br/>
then the answers will make a lot more sense.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; No Joyce, not direct<br/>
&gt; quotes but that&#39;s the gist of it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Direct quotes will help the conversation become helpful because you  <br/>
are taking in the words and their meaning is changing inside of you  <br/>
so you think -- *insisting* -- we&#39;re saying something we&#39;re not. So,  <br/>
please, direct quotes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; At NO time did I ever say my vision was better than yours. What you<br/>
&gt; do with your kids in your home is your business.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again you misread.<br/>
<br/>
What I said is you are insisting you can see what is going on in our  <br/>
homes better than we can see. You are telling us what it&#39;s like in  <br/>
our homes: that we have child kings, that we are slaves to the   <br/>
philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
We are saying, no, you&#39;re misunderstanding.<br/>
<br/>
You say, no, I&#39;m right. I got the gist of it. Here&#39;s what is happening.<br/>
<br/>
Do you see how your telling us what is true in our own homes could  <br/>
make having a discussion really difficult?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do not insist, force, coerce nor even ask a child to do<br/>
&gt; anything because that is against the philosophy.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>See, how many times does it need repeated, that isn&#39;t what we&#39;re saying?<br/>
<br/>
But, instead of letting go of that idea, you keep reading what people  <br/>
are saying and forcing it  into that idea.<br/>
<br/>
As someone once said, to understand a new idea you need to empty your  <br/>
cup first. You need to let go of what you *think* we&#39;re saying. You  <br/>
need to let go of the filters that are sorting the answers into  <br/>
&quot;Child gets his way&quot; and &quot;Parent gets her way.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We aren&#39;t saying either and until you can see that there&#39;s *other*  <br/>
options, the answers just won&#39;t  make sense.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If I am told that children should not be asked to do chores, to clean<br/>
&gt; their rooms, to exercise, or in any other way help the family, then I<br/>
&gt; have to assume this is rule by children.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*DON&#39;T* assume. *Ask.* Please! Because you&#39;re guesses are wrong and  <br/>
that&#39;s why the answers aren&#39;t making sense.<br/>
<br/>
If your goal is having children help today, there isn&#39;t a way of  <br/>
doing that other than by force.<br/>
<br/>
If your goal is long term in having children who help you because  <br/>
they want to help you, then we can help with that.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s more accurate to say the goal for mindful parents isn&#39;t  <br/>
to throw out solutions because they&#39;re disrespectful. The goal is to  <br/>
find respectful solutions.<br/>
<br/>
The first goal would leave us with no way of handling problems! The  <br/>
second is action oriented towards the goal of respect and great  <br/>
relationships.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I understand that you probably grow tired of answering the same<br/>
&gt; questions over and over again<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually not. I&#39;ve been doing this for 12 years answering the same  <br/>
questions hundreds of times.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s tiring is people reading what gets written and misinterpreting  <br/>
it and *then* saying &quot;My interpretation of what&#39;s happening in your  <br/>
homes is right. How could I possibly interpret it any way other than  <br/>
I am? So, how can you possibly live like that?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And then it goes round and round with people saying &quot;No, you&#39;re  <br/>
misinterpreting.&quot; and being responded with, &quot;How can I be  <br/>
misinterpreting? You *are* saying that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s truly maddening.<br/>
<br/>
The only benefit is that the responses clarify points for *other*  <br/>
people who are reading. Several people are probably saying &quot;Oh, I get  <br/>
it now.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; &gt; The question still stands: If you ask your child to do  <br/>
&gt;&gt; something, can<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; the child say no and you&#39;ll be okay with that?<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Nothing about always say no. It&#39;s just common courtesy that when  <br/>
&gt;&gt; you<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; ask someone to do you a favor, you need to be okay with no. If  <br/>
&gt;&gt; you&#39;re<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; not okay with no, then you aren&#39;t asking. You&#39;re disguising a  <br/>
&gt;&gt; command<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; as a question. And if you don&#39;t see it as a favor you&#39;re asking,  <br/>
&gt;&gt; then<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; you&#39;ve imposed an obligation on them and, again, it&#39;s not a  <br/>
&gt;&gt; question.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; It&#39;s just a command.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; **And this would be against the philosophy yes?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you can answer the question, rather than throwing back your  <br/>
interpretation *again* of what I must mean, then people might be able  <br/>
to help you through the process of understanding.<br/>
<br/>
If you keep filtering my meaning through your own understanding it&#39;s  <br/>
just not going to make sense.<br/>
<br/>
To understand you need to let go of the idea that we have child- <br/>
kings. To understand you need to let go of the idea that someone must  <br/>
lose in order for someone else to win. You need to let go of the idea  <br/>
of the goal being winning or losing.<br/>
<br/>
To understand you need to assume that we want a lot of what you want  <br/>
and don&#39;t want a lot of what you don&#39;t want. We DON&#39;T want our  <br/>
children to be unhealthy. We DON&#39;T want our houses to be pig styes.  <br/>
We DON&#39;T want to be slaves to our children. We DO want joyful family  <br/>
lives. We DON&#39;T want the pretense of a joyful life where the kids are  <br/>
happy and mom&#39;s miserable because the kids get what they want and mom  <br/>
has to give up everything.<br/>
<br/>
We DO want to find respectful solutions to the problems that come up  <br/>
in our lives.<br/>
<br/>
Just because we aren&#39;t doing what you think must be done doesn&#39;t mean  <br/>
we want the opposite. *Assume* we want healthy kids. Then work to  <br/>
understand how the answers are about helping our kids be healthy.<br/>
<br/>
Throw away your assumption of what must be happening in our homes.  <br/>
Throw away what you think must be the outcome and just really listen  <br/>
to what people are saying.<br/>

<br/>
One of the conceptual shifts I mentioned was to learn to think of <br/>
behavior as communication - *why* is your oldest deciding to be &quot;an <br/>
ass&quot; to his little brother? What&#39;s leading up to this? Is the older <br/>
guy feeling put-upon? Crowded? Bored? Needing some quiet? Needing <br/>
some attention? Those are all possible triggers for lashing out at <br/>
someone. That&#39;s not an excuse, its a clue to mom that she needs to <br/>
be more involved and proactive in some way. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe mom needs to hang out more when the brothers are in the same <br/>
room together - that&#39;s something I had to do a Lot of for Months <br/>
after Ray came to live with us, in part bc he had all <br/>
these &quot;schoolyard&quot; behaviors that really weren&#39;t great ways to <br/>
relate to a smaller, younger kid. Nowadays I *still* expect to have <br/>
to hang out more if the kids have been separated for a week or more -<br/>
 like when Ray went to visit his grandma, or Mo and I went to L&L. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe mom needs to look at what kinds of expectations she has for <br/>
the boys based on their ages. I know *I* need to remind myself on a <br/>
regular basis that 14 is still pretty young - especially since the <br/>
14yo in question is six feet (almost 2m) tall! Its easy to look at <br/>
two children and see one as being soooo much bigger and older and <br/>
have unrealistic expectations as a result. Its a really common <br/>
pitfall - and one of the sources of resentment and corespondingly <br/>
ugly behavior on the part of older kids. The behavior is saying &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
in over my head mom! Help!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Be sure you&#39;re still giving your oldest kid (he&#39;s 11, right?) lots <br/>
of love and attention and support. He needs that to help him heal <br/>
from school and to get back in touch with who he really is as a <br/>
person. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I hope you can see from the above that what I&#39;m advocating is not an <br/>
abdication of parenting, but More parenting for All your kids. Kids <br/>
in school are shoved into a greater degree of independence than is <br/>
really healthy for them. Your kids need some time to be a little <br/>
more needy so that they can start to develop some trust in You as <br/>
their support system. They don&#39;t have that yet.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What I am talking about are those things<br/>
&gt; that we all must do in life to get along and get by.  Not to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>demand more<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; than others have.  Not to take without giving.  Not to feed the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>selfish<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; parts of us all the time.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, I&#39;m reading this as a statement of personal values (or in <br/>
unschooling jargon &quot;principles&quot;). One of the troubles I&#39;m seeing is <br/>
that they&#39;re all starting with the word &quot;not&quot; - that&#39;s important. <br/>
Knowing what you want to avoid in life doesn&#39;t necessarily help you <br/>
move Toward anything. How could you re-think these ideas in a more <br/>
positive way? Generosity, perhaps? Then think about how you can <br/>
encourage generosity in your home - first by modelling it yourself, <br/>
and then by helping your kids find ways to be generous of one <br/>
another.  <br/>
<br/>
Do you see how you have to shift your thinking to do that? Its <br/>
unlikely that anyone is going to feel generous towards a brother <br/>
when he&#39;s always being asked to give things up - he&#39;s more likely to <br/>
feel put-upon. So how can you help your guys feel as though their <br/>
lives are so Full - of love, care, time, grace, and joy - that they <br/>
can give those things away by the handful? More parenting. More <br/>
presence and love and care and time and grace and joy From Mom. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Upon further reflection I don&#39;t believe that it&#39;s OK for anyone to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>always<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; say no all the time. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is why unchoolers work to Say Yes More! Moms and dads are often <br/>
in the position of saying No over and over - not right now, stop it, <br/>
you can&#39;t have x until you do y, etc. Find ways to say Yes, yourself <br/>
so your kids can see what a life full of possibilites looks like. <br/>
Yes you can have another. Yes, I&#39;m available right now. Yes, I&#39;m <br/>
listening. Yes, your thoughts and feeling and wants and wishes and <br/>
hopes and dreams are important to me. Yes, I love you with all my <br/>
heart. Yes, there is enough love, time, grace, and joy for all of us <br/>
all the time. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1905310691">Dear unschooling group/joyce:<br/>
<br/>
  Hello I am Rebecca DeHate and I kind of unschool... Here&#39;s my scoop <br/>
my friend hooked me up with this group about 2 years ago when I was <br/>
having difficulty with my child (or should I say I was having <br/>
difficulties with how to be a consensual/mindful parent-- wasn&#39;t at <br/>
all up to that point).  Anyway, I checked out this sight and the <br/>
light bulbs came on..I started working on some of the approaches <br/>
suggested in our discussions.  However, since than I&#39;ve gotten busy <br/>
(aren&#39;t we all) and have been slipping into old patterns.  Like <br/>
demanding, yelling, etc.  Thanks to the above subject (you don&#39;t make <br/>
them do anything?) Joanne happen to put something into perspect  --- <br/>
and that is to in general or overall if we work on respecting each <br/>
others wishes, respecting a NO response, and finding mutual <br/>
agreements -- argueing and fighting will lessen.,...<br/>
<br/>
So with that here are some questions for all of you&gt;<br/>
<br/>
First I&#39;ll tell you a bit about myself: I&#39;m basically a single <br/>
parent, I know have a boyfriend that lives with me and we are working <br/>
on a partnership....  anyway I have a 5 year old boy, Ian  who has <br/>
benefitted tremendously when I have implemented mindful parenting, a <br/>
19 month old son who I haven&#39;t been implementing the best tactics and <br/>
need some help with, and now a 14 year old &quot;step-daughter&quot; who I try <br/>
to implement mindful parenting but kind of battle the dad with his <br/>
demanding, old fashioned I can say &quot;no&quot; because I&#39;m the parent and I <br/>
know best attitude (which I often slip into also -- old patterns are <br/>
truly hard to break).<br/>
<br/>
Secondly,  I am not an unschooler completely because both my 5 year <br/>
old and 14 year old go to school.  I chose for my 5 year old to go <br/>
because he really wanted to go plus I work.  and I and her dad have <br/>
given the 14 year old a choice to home school but she want to go to <br/>
school still.  sooo....<br/>
<br/>
However, I value the thoughts of unschooler because the parenting <br/>
ideals can be applied no matter what and thus far you folks are about <br/>
the only ones that I feel &quot;right&quot; with their thoughts on parenting.<br/>
<br/>
soooo.... here&#39;s a scenerio that has occured and I would love some <br/>
input on how unschoolers would have responded.<br/>
   The 14 year old came home with a progress report from earth <br/>
science stating she had missed at least 3 homework assignments and is <br/>
holding a c in the class.  Now her dad and I took away her going to <br/>
games (soccer and football) until her grade came up and homework was <br/>
being done.... <br/>
    her response:  pissy for a week, kept herself in her room, tried <br/>
to keep talking dad to let her go to games, attitude in general, <br/>
didn&#39;t really help around house at all (dad&#39;s a truck driver -- when <br/>
he&#39;s gone she is usually very helpful to me -- helps keep the house <br/>
up, babysits the boys, and rarely gives me an attitude ) Now before <br/>
her dad left for another trip I asked if we should come to a happy <br/>
compromise so she could go to games but for any missed homework or <br/>
c&#39;s on report card she would miss a game per... now I know <br/>
unschoolers don&#39;t have to deal with grades which I wish I didn&#39;t have <br/>
to either but I feel like because this is where were at we need to <br/>
keep encouraging her to keep up with school.  Now let me back track <br/>
just a little, when I looked at her progress report when she did her <br/>
homework she usually recieved all the points -- so from that I glean <br/>
that she is can do the homework just chose not to...  And at the same <br/>
time her dad has state that he doesn&#39;t need her to have all a&#39;s just <br/>
as long as she&#39;s trying.(not doing homework is not trying)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ok here&#39;s another scenerio with my 19 month old.   when he doesn&#39;t <br/>
get his way or we just don&#39;t understand what he wants he has quite a <br/>
fit... screaming at top of his lungs hitting, etc.  I&#39;m not even sure <br/>
how to respond ... i try to side track, I&#39;ve yelled (oops that&#39;s so <br/>
wrong I know that I&#39;m just encouraging what he&#39;s already doing) I&#39;ve <br/>
even spanked -- another no -no but old habit  -- I even hate it.... <br/>
but sometimes it just sets me into another world --- however, since <br/>
I&#39;ve been making myself pay attention again,  I&#39;m trying to just <br/>
remain calm and even ignore it ... Is ignoring the right thing to do -<br/>
- I&#39;m thinking if I just ignore it he&#39;ll know it isn&#39;t working..(why <br/>
is it I feel like a new mom half the time??)  anyway,  some of things <br/>
we &quot;fight&quot; over :  he wants to go outside and it&#39;s too wet or I&#39;m <br/>
just not ready to go out yet  or both,  Yesterday, he wanted <br/>
something done with his rocking horse and I just didn&#39;t know what?? <br/>
went for a walk and he didn&#39;t want to but the rest of us were --- <br/>
forgot stroller... tried to just have him let me rest a little -- at <br/>
the end of the walk he finally was willing to walk --- what did he <br/>
just see the car and know it was almost over:)  <br/>
<br/>
Another flaw of mine is that I swear.  Now in my eyes casual swear <br/>
words here and there are no big deal --=-  but when I swear at the <br/>
kids it&#39;s just not right sounds super harsh  --any suggestions how to <br/>
correct this --- <br/>
<br/>
Another super big flaw of mine is that I just blow up rather easy... <br/>
I have corrected this in the past and know that some of the excuses i <br/>
give for it is stress over money, decisions, lack of sleep, (I do <br/>
take zoloft that helps curb the stress factor)  etc but there just <br/>
excuses it isn&#39;t my kids fault...  <br/>
<br/>
So there it is my candid thoughts and questions I look forward to <br/>
your thoughts ...</div>

 </span></blockquote>Some kids are more emotionally volitile and more expressive than <br/>
others. Some kids are more easily frustrated. It may help you to <br/>
acknowledge that - its not necessarily a Bad thing that he&#39;s melting <br/>
down, he just doesn&#39;t have the skills to do anything else yet. If <br/>
you can prevent more of these situations (the whole paying attention <br/>
thing only moreso) that will be good all &#39;round. <br/>
<br/>
A lot of preventing those kinds of situations involves thinking out <br/>
of the box. Its raining but we can put some boots on. Its getting <br/>
dark so lets get a flashlight. The store&#39;s not open yet, but we can <br/>
do something fun while we wait. Some of the thinking out of the box <br/>
involves flat-out asking yourself &quot;why the heck not?&quot; and realizing <br/>
that the only reason why is that your mom never let you do it when <br/>
you were small. Oops.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the only answer really is &quot;no&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m sorry, that&#39;s just <br/>
not possible&quot;. Mom can&#39;t make it stop raining, can&#39;t keep the sun <br/>
from going down, can&#39;t put the milk back in the broken glass. And <br/>
sometimes a child needs some time to react to those impossibilities <br/>
without mom trying to stop the crying or fix the unfixable. <br/>
Depending on the child, he may need a hug, or a few words of shared <br/>
sadness, or something safe to hit, or a quiet, safe space where he <br/>
doesn&#39;t have to look at any other person. Figuring out what a child <br/>
needs in those moments takes a certain amount of trial and error, <br/>
but even when nothing seems to be working you can keep saying &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
sorry&quot; - or some other expression of shared disappointment. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Its important to take care of your own needs as much as possible so <br/>
that you have the reserves you need to handle issues that come up <br/>
unexpectedly. I&#39;m going to toss out a link to &quot;Always Unschoooled&quot; <br/>
since we recently had a thread over there about the care and feeding <br/>
of moms of young children:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysUnschooled">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysUnschooled</a><br/>
<br/>
Taking care of our own needs is a perrenial problem for lots and <br/>
lots of moms. Keep in mind that when your reserves are &quot;topped up&quot; <br/>
is when you get to practice the skills you need to cope better when <br/>
you&#39;re running on empty. And the bad blow-ups are at least a place <br/>
to consider what you might have done better and maybe learn <br/>
something - and a time when you get to practice appologising to your <br/>
kids. That&#39;s an imporatnt skill, too.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, I&#39;m probably going to say the most radical thing you&#39;ve ever <br/>
heard anyone say about homework, so brace yourself really hard - <br/>
ready? Do it for her. I&#39;m totally serious. If she&#39;s missing <br/>
asignments and still passing the course, then the homework isn&#39;t <br/>
helping her learn the material anyway - if the homework didn&#39;t count <br/>
*against* her, she&#39;d be getting a better grade. So take the homework <br/>
out of the equation. <br/>
<br/>
I run another board for unschoolers with atypical families (some <br/>
kids in school, single parents, step-kids, etc) if you&#39;re interested <br/>
in talking about this sort of thing in more detail:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/crazylifeunschoolers">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/crazylifeunschoolers</a><br/>
<br/>
I believe there&#39;s also an &quot;unschooling school&quot; list - anyone have <br/>
the addy? I don&#39;t recall it offhand.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Now her dad and I took away her going to <br/>
&gt; games (soccer and football) until her grade came up and homework <br/>

&gt;     her response:  pissy for a week, kept herself in her room, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>tried <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to keep talking dad to let her go to games, attitude in general, <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yup, that&#39;s what happens. Otoh, if you were doing her homework for <br/>
her, you&#39;d have some time together in the evenings (she&#39;ll probably <br/>
need to copy it out in her own handwriting) and she&#39;ll feel <br/>
supported and grateful, rather than pissy. She&#39;ll learn that she can <br/>
depend on you to help her out if she needs it, without giving her <br/>
crap. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; her dad has state that he doesn&#39;t need her to have all a&#39;s just <br/>
&gt; as long as she&#39;s trying.(not doing homework is not trying)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>From her perspective, doing homework *isn&#39;t* trying, its a useless <br/>
waste of her time. And she&#39;s right - even with the missed <br/>
assignments, she&#39;s still passing. Its fortuante for y&#39;all that she <br/>
even has the option of choosing to not-do homework and accept a <br/>
lower grade. Many school districts are starting to penalize students <br/>
in other ways for missed homework - at my stepson&#39;s school, they <br/>
adminisitered corporal punishment and detentions for missed <br/>
asignments!<br/>

<br/>
You did say it was her choice to go to school, but why impose *your*  <br/>
expectations on what she needs to get out of it? If she wants to go  <br/>
to school for social reasons, that&#39;s as valid as for academic. But I  <br/>
think Sandra covers that fairly well in her essay.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; when he doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; get his way<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It will be hugely helpful when looking at the problem he&#39;s having to  <br/>
see this as &quot;when he doesn&#39;t get his needs met&quot; or &quot;when he can&#39;t get  <br/>
his point across&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is ignoring the right thing to do<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you were so supremely frustrated because people weren&#39;t  <br/>
understanding you that you had to drop to the floor to scream out  <br/>
your frustration, would you want people to ignore you?<br/>
<br/>
(It depends on the child, of course and depends on what triggers it.  <br/>
The point is don&#39;t ask us. Look at your child and figure out what  <br/>
*he* wants you to do.)<br/>
<br/>
While it always sounds rude, but the mindful parenting approach is to  <br/>
become more aware to tend to the child before the tantrum hits.  <br/>
Anticipate his needs. Is he too hot or cold? Is he running low on  <br/>
fuel? Is he tired? Has he been sitting to long?<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t, of course, always do that. Sometimes *they* don&#39;t know  <br/>
what&#39;s wrong, but the focus is in being more aware to minimize the  <br/>
meltdowns. The fewer meltdowns he has, the more he feels you &#39;re  <br/>
doing your best to meet his needs, the more forgiving he&#39;ll be when  <br/>
they aren&#39;t. (Though it might be much to expect of a 19 mo. It *will*  <br/>
come.)<br/>
<br/>
It can also be his age.<br/>
<br/>
But try to think in terms of &quot;Yes&quot;. Which doesn&#39;t always mean &quot;I&#39;ll  <br/>
drop this right now and do that.&quot; It means, &quot;I&#39;m taking your request  <br/>
seriously but there&#39;s a few obstacles in my way.&quot; So you can say  <br/>
&quot;Yes, let&#39;s get our umbrellas and go out.&quot; (But really, weren&#39;t kids  <br/>
made to get wet?) &quot;Yes, I&#39;ll be done with the dishes in 10 minutes.  <br/>
If you&#39;d like to keep me company the time will seem to go faster.&quot;  <br/>
There&#39;s a post I wrote &quot;Always say yes&quot; that&#39;s here:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/changing%20parenting/alwayssayyes.html">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/changing%20parenting/alwayssayyes.html</a><br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s just the tip of possibilities. The question has come up a lot  <br/>
and it might be worth going through the archives for other responses.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Another super big flaw of mine is that I just blow up rather easy...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lots of anger is about lack of control. It&#39;s natural to get upset  <br/>
when the world isn&#39;t working the way we want it to. So a lot of it is  <br/>
mentally shifting to the idea that the world isn&#39;t in our control. It  <br/>
becomes pointless to be angry at the rain when we know there isn&#39;t  <br/>
anything we can do to make it stop! :-) And that feeling can extend  <br/>
to other parts of life.<br/>
<br/>
We can *affect* the world by our actions but we can&#39;t *control* it.<br/>
<br/>
Often it&#39;s also about expectations (which is related). When we expect  <br/>
the world to do one thing, or expect another person to behave in one  <br/>
way and they don&#39;t then it&#39;s frustrating. So dropping expectations is  <br/>
another mental shift.<br/>
<br/>
That makes it sound simple, but of course it isn&#39;t! It does take a  <br/>
determination to change and it&#39;s easy to slip back into old ways.  <br/>
Focusing on the person you want to be helps a lot. Pam Sorooshian  <br/>
talks about giving yourself two choices and then choosing the better  <br/>
one. Rather than trying to become perfect, just work on being better  <br/>
and better. You&#39;ll have setbacks but focus on making the next moment  <br/>
better.<br/>
