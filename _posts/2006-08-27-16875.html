<div id="ygrps-yiv-965928689">Don&#39;t know if this is an appropriate post, but this is our dream!  Living in<br/>
an RV, unschooling on the road!  Here are a few families doing it and I<br/>
thought I would share here as not many other people would get it.  <br/>
<br/>
I am tossing around the idea of doing a home swap for a month, trading our<br/>
home for an rv for a month to travel.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2069976422">Hi Mik,<br/>
<br/>
We did that! I mean, we travelled around in an RV for 5 months and <br/>
lived and learned on the road. It was fantastic (of course). <br/>
Whatever was learned on that trip will not be forgotten by any of us.<br/>
My dd was 6 at the time and ds 9. Unfortunately that was the time we <br/>
discovered ds cannot deal with changing environment and not knowing <br/>
what will happen next very well. He coped, but after 4 months we <br/>
were all ready to go home. He was because he was terribly homesick. <br/>
We were, becausue he made our lives unpleasant. <br/>
Dh and I have always wanted to not own a home and live on the road. <br/>
I guess we better wait until ds is not living with us anymore.<br/>
Many families are doing this and most of them unschool, though some <br/>
of them do school at home/RV. It is not as hard as you may think to <br/>
make a living on the road either. There are multiple websites for <br/>
finding jobs and magazines too (workers on wheels is one). It would <br/>
also benefit you to check out escapees club. A club of people living <br/>
on the road permanently. Most of them retired, but there are <br/>
families that are members (we are). They offer mail forwarding, <br/>
message service, email addresses etc. and lots of advice (what about <br/>
taxes, car/rv registration, what is your home state &quot;officially&quot; <br/>
etc.)<br/>
The national Park Services and State parks offer splendid <br/>
opportunities for learning that are totally fun. So does <br/>
volunteering somewhere (anywhere) for a while. <br/>
One family I know wrote a book on this, but they did not do it <br/>
fully, though. They used hotels a lot (too expensive and no fun if <br/>
you&#39;re really going for it) and used a van to travel in. I don&#39;t <br/>
believe they were unschooling. We met them at Rethinking Education <br/>
one year.Still, their book is interesting for getting ideas: <br/>
Headfirst into America by Marlene Smith-Graham.<br/>
The website you posted is one that we used a lot at the time.<br/>
Anyway, there is *a lot* of info on this out there and many books on <br/>
living in an RV full-time.<br/>
My advice, if your kids are willing, go for it, you will not regret <br/>
it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1617853844">Thanks for the links.  I really enjoyed the workers or wheels.  <br/>
 <br/>
Because my husband is a bi-lateral amputee, he needs really really good<br/>
health insurance to pay for his prosthesis every 2-4 years.  (btw-you&#39;d<br/>
never know he is an amputee to look at him, he walks, runs, has a motorcycle<br/>
license) SOOOO----we are really tied to the land and needing to have that<br/>
job with good benefits.  I am hoping that we can do the swap thing (my house<br/>
for your rv) so we can experience SOME of the road.  As a one income (I do<br/>
some doula work/breastfeeding counseling/education-not enough to make<br/>
money), we can&#39;t really afford to buy an RV so we are getting creative.  We<br/>
love our pop up, but it just isn&#39;t the same!<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe we will join our homeschooling friends in Costa Rica....supposedly,<br/>
the health care system there is excellent and affordable.<br/>
 <br/>
Dreaming over here in CT!<br/>
