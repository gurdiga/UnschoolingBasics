<div id="ygrps-yiv-1538632629">Ok, I&#39;m not usually like this...but...I&#39;m asking for help. I posted a few  <br/>
days ago about my teens...and I got a very sweet, private reply that I saved to  <br/>
keep me sane :) (Thank, you, Honey, it meant a LOT to me! &lt;-- there&#39;s my  <br/>
southern coming out to say hello ;) ) But...wah...lol...I was hoping someone  <br/>
else might also say something? I can take harshness! Perhaps I was unclear, the  <br/>
title was &quot;update&quot; or some such thing, and maybe what I SHOULD have said was - <br/>
 Please Give Me Some Advice Because My Heart is Breaking, or maybe, Advice, <br/>
Para  Mi, Por Favor? :) <br/>
 <br/>
I hope I hit send. I&#39;m shy to ask again...because I figure, either ya&#39;ll  had <br/>
no idea I needed a reply, or maybe because I kicked my daughter out I might  <br/>
be shunned and excommunicated, or maybe I&#39;m beyond the help of experienced  <br/>
unschoolers. I just SO appreciate the advice and wisdom here...I can&#39;t help but  <br/>
ask again. <br/>
 <br/>
I hope I hit send...sitting here...contemplating...<br/>
 <br/>
Erg. <br/>

I&#39;m glad you brought this up! I think we all got sidetracked onto the<br/>
tv discussion. Sometimes a post gets lost in the shuffle and it&#39;s<br/>
really great to bring it back around if you want feedback. <br/>
<br/>
Would you  mind posting the original post again? Remind us what the<br/>
exact situation was. Thanks Karen!<br/>

e-mails and thought for sure someone helped you I am going to get <br/>
kids ready for bed and then I will write longer.<br/>

Hang in there and get a hug from somebody.<br/>
