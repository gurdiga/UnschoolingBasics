I have read the book already, I found it to be intriguing in theory but<br/>
clumsy and awkward feeling in practice. Perhaps it was just my need to use<br/>
it more to get more comfortable with it. I just felt very artificial saying<br/>
some of the things the way it was suggested.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I will give it another look,<br/>
.......<br/>
<br/>
I know what you mean.  I&#39;d signed onto the NVC list to hopefully learn more <br/>
about it and how to implement it NATURALLY.  I had to sign off the list w/i a <br/>
month because the stilted language they use in the posts felt to me like nails <br/>
on a blackboard!<br/>
<br/>
I do understand what Rosenberg is saying however, and think you can really <br/>
use the communication ideas he sets forth, WITHOUT actually having to &#39;speak&#39; <br/>
like that (example, When you told me xxx, it met my need for xxxx and made me <br/>
feel xxxx).  ARGH...drove me nuts...sounds so robotic or something.  <br/>
<br/>
Just take the ideas and use them naturally...they work!  There are some great <br/>
little pamphlets available on the NVC website that I get a lot out of, too.  <br/>
Parenting From Your Heart - Sharing the gifts of compassion, connection, and <br/>
choice is one.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-725189568">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I agree with the frustration with the stilted language, but you can <br/>
still apply the concepts without all the fanfare.. An example:<br/>
<br/>
Prior to NVC:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Bethan! You left the caps off your markers! If you don&#39;t take care of <br/>
your things, you&#39;ll ruin them &lt;and blah de blah de blah, lecture <br/>
ensues.&gt; Help me pick them up!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
NVC model: &quot;Bethan, when I see the caps of the markers, I feel concerned <br/>
because I value taking care of the things we have and I don&#39;t want to <br/>
waste resourses by spending money replacing them. I&#39;d rather buy <br/>
something fun that we don&#39;t already have. I need you to help me pick <br/>
them up.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Real Life: &quot;Bethan. I see that there are no caps on your markers.&quot; <br/>
&lt;pause, where Bethan might say &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t want them to dry out,&quot; and <br/>
starts putting caps on&gt;. If she doesn&#39;t, I say &quot;I don&#39;t want them to dry <br/>
out.&quot; and start to put them on myself. On a good day, this will be <br/>
followed up with &quot;Red marker, red marker where you? Where are you? I am <br/>
holding your cap, I am holding your cap, its red too, its red too.&quot;  <br/>
This, to the tune of Brother John where we make a game of matching the <br/>
marker cap to the marker color.<br/>
<br/>
The import thing is stating the observation rather than making blaming <br/>
statements &quot;you left the caps of your markers.&quot; It&#39;s still NVC, it&#39;s <br/>
just abbreviated.<br/>

I liked your example Jen.  I do something very similar.  Even though I<br/>
didn&#39;t like the NVC communication style, I still learned a lot from the book<br/>
and have made positive changes in how I communicate with my children.  <br/>

I do a lot of the &quot;I&#39;m concerned about...&quot; kind of statements in trying <br/>
to own my fears instead of foisting them on my kids. I don&#39;t think it <br/>
comes across as stilted (maybe others would! *g*) but more like doing <br/>
math outloud--showing my reasoning process.<br/>
<br/>
It drives me nutso when dh says, &quot;Stop doing that; you&#39;re going to get <br/>
hurt!&quot; Well, truth is they probably won&#39;t get hurt. Truth is, we&#39;re <br/>
worried that they might get hurt. So, I will say, &quot;I&#39;m worried you&#39;re <br/>
going to fall off&quot; or something of the sort.<br/>
<br/>
I find these kinds of statements useful, particularly with young <br/>
children, because it builds my reasoning right into the comment and <br/>
eliminates the typical &quot;Why?&quot; response. The kids may still have <br/>
questions, but they know why I&#39;m asking them to do something and can <br/>
judge for themselves the rationality of the request.<br/>

<br/>
You and me too, sista!  My dh is famous for that line.  My kids are<br/>
naturally kind of timid anyway and I don&#39;t want them to be worry warts like<br/>
dh&#39;s side of the family. They worry obsessively, imo, and don&#39;t enjoy life<br/>
to the fullest because of all the what-ifs.  I try to counter it as best I<br/>
can, but I&#39;m sure it has made an impact on them.  Maybe it&#39;ll just be the<br/>
kind of impact where they say to themselves, &quot;I&#39;ll never say that to *my*<br/>
kids when I grow up!&quot;  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Or how about just see that situation as one where you AND the kid both <br/>
have the same goals  - having fun with the markers, now and in the <br/>
future? And the adult has slightly better ability to predict the future <br/>
so helps the kid out by sticking lids back on markers?<br/>
<br/>
Most likely I&#39;d say, &quot;I&#39;m sticking the lids back on as you use them. <br/>
Otherwise they&#39;ll dry out and they won&#39;t work next time you want them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I still say, &quot;I&#39;m hanging up your wet towel so it&#39;ll be dry next time <br/>
you want it.&quot; To my 19 year old &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
So - maybe my &quot;method&quot; didn&#39;t work since I&#39;m still saying it &lt;G&gt;. But, <br/>
truth is, she&#39;ll say to ME, &quot;Mom, I&#39;m taking your plate to the kitchen <br/>
so the dog doesn&#39;t get your sandwich.&quot;  Helping each other out. That&#39;s <br/>
the principle. (And she keeps the lids on her markers, by the way, and <br/>
on all her art supplies - and she has a LOT of them, used frequently. <br/>
She&#39;s figured out that they last better, that way.)<br/>

I find this extremely helpful. It&#39;s clear to me that I&#39;m not &quot;doing it<br/>
right&quot; with dh, because he immediately gets irate when I try it. Perhaps he<br/>
sees it as my attempt to manipulate him (not altogether without<br/>
justification).<br/>
<br/>
These real life examples are much clearer than the blueprint type language<br/>
on the website.<br/>

Yeah----I remember my mother&#39;s efforts. It was as if she&#39;d just finished a  <br/>
psychology class on behavior modification. I didn&#39;t appreciate my position of  <br/>
lab rat---like I was living in a Skinner box.<br/>
 <br/>
It didn&#39;t work.<br/>
