<div id="ygrps-yiv-124288639">Just thought I would share this - I have recently subscribed to this online<br/>
free email service called &quot;Clickschooling&quot; where you get one cool site to go<br/>
to each day. I have been quite impressed with some of the offerings lately.<br/>
 <br/>
Warm regards,<br/>

Hi!  It&#39;s Monday, March 14, 2005 and time for Math at ClickSchooling!<br/>
<br/>
Recommended Website:<br/>
PhilTulga.com: Music Through The Curriculum<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.philtulga.com/resources.html">http://www.philtulga.com/resources.html</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, THIS is a real find!  I stumbled upon this site quite by accident, and<br/>
I&#39;m so glad I did -- you will be too!  :)  Phil Tulga is a professional<br/>
musician and music instructor. He has developed educational programs that<br/>
weave music through the curriculum in almost every subject.  He presents<br/>
those programs to students in public and private schools in Sacramento,<br/>
California and is available for private groups and organizations as well. As<br/>
a complement to his music programs, Phil has developed a series of FREE,<br/>
interactive music activities that are available at his website in math,<br/>
science, reading comprehension and much more.<br/>
<br/>
When you get to the site you will see a menu that includes:<br/>
<br/>
*MATH AND MUSIC -- Phil has taken popular math manipulatives and enhanced<br/>
them with rhythm and music. You&#39;ll find:<br/>
<br/>
-Unifix Cube Drum Machine -- This shows students how famous composers have<br/>
used repeating patterns to create music. Students can make their own rhythm<br/>
or drum patterns with popular Unifix cubes.<br/>
<br/>
-Musical Fraction Bars -- Mathematicians like Pythagoras discovered that<br/>
musical pitches are derived from fractions. In this activity, students<br/>
compose and play their own songs using Musical Fraction Bars. Not only that,<br/>
you&#39;ll find instructions for how to build a homemade musical instrument that<br/>
is based on these fractions.<br/>
<br/>
-Pattern Block Rock -- Song melodies are patterns of short and long sounds.<br/>
In this activity, students compose and play their own rhythmic songs using<br/>
geometric shapes.<br/>
<br/>
-Fraction Pie Rhythms -- This activity shows how musical note durations are<br/>
organized into fractions, e.g., two half notes equal one whole note. Compose<br/>
and play your own rhythms using pie fractions instead of standard musical<br/>
notation.<br/>
<br/>
-Morse Code Music -- Listen to Phil as he plays patterns on his telephone<br/>
using short and long sounds. These patterns are very much like International<br/>
Morse Code - a method of encoding each letter and number into short and long<br/>
sounds called dots and dashes. In this activity, you can compose and play<br/>
your own rhythmic patterns using International Morse Code.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
After math, you&#39;ll find additional activities including:<br/>
<br/>
*HOMEMADE INSTRUMENTS -- Find directions for making your own panpipes, water<br/>
bottle xylophone, tubular Glockenspiel, and an origami popper!<br/>
<br/>
*MATH, SCIENCE AND SOUND ACTIVITIES -- Explore 12 different musical<br/>
activities to learn about sound waves, frequencies, and even find out what<br/>
frequencies animals can hear.<br/>
<br/>
*READING COMPREHENSION -- Unbelievable as it may seem, Phil uses musical<br/>
sound to teach sequences to improve reading skills, and he teaches<br/>
inferences with riddles, picture puzzle predictions, and uses &quot;Peter and the<br/>
Wolf&quot; to teach musical themes and storyline components complete with story<br/>
maps!<br/>
<br/>
*READING FLUENCY -- Get Phil&#39;s tips for parents on how to encourage a love<br/>
of reading in your child. Then, use the innovative &quot;Cucumber Pickle Machine&quot;<br/>
to show your kids how to make rhythmic meters by combining two and three<br/>
syllable words!<br/>
<br/>
*PATTERN ACTIVITIES -- You won&#39;t believe this! Musical sequencing with<br/>
Fibonacci numbers and Pi! Not only that, play &quot;Name That Tune&quot; or learn<br/>
about music and the &quot;Mozart Effect.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This site gets a ClickSchooling Award for the best use of technology in<br/>
helping kids learn!<br/>
