 </span></blockquote>Yep, he&#39;s  working for Air National Guard (ANG) so he spends his days <br/>
wrestling with  lots of different Guard units! &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I read that, and it didn&#39;t even register! Maybe because I refer to ours as  <br/>
SCANG! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
How does he do that and move around? I thought Guard units were manned by  <br/>
locals ---that you weren&#39;t moved around like regular air force. <br/>
 <br/>
What does he do? Make them all work together for something?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>He is regular AF, just working for ANG right now. We didn&#39;t really <br/>
know that happened until he was looking for a new position here and <br/>
there was an opening at the ANG Readiness Center! <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know what he does, but I guess I haven&#39;t described it in my own <br/>
words much, because I&#39;m not sure how to explain! Cutting and pasting <br/>
here...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The Air National Guard Readiness Center develops, manages and <br/>
directs Air National Guard programs that implement national-level <br/>
policies set by the Department of Defense, the Air Force and the <br/>
National Guard Bureau. It also performs operational and technical <br/>
functions to ensure combat readiness of ANG units and is a channel of <br/>
communication between the NGB and the states on ANG operational <br/>
activities.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yep, that&#39;s it. So he&#39;s in charge of deploying maintenance troops for <br/>
various types of planes...he figures out what&#39;s needed and then tries <br/>
to help the units actually have the right people and equipment. <br/>
Pretty important stuff these days and he&#39;s really happy to be making <br/>
an impact.<br/>
