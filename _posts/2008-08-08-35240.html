<div id="ygrps-yiv-2047516129">~~<br/>
Exactly. Some people who are having trouble living happily as<br/>
unschoolers might find your flavor of sensitivity helpful. Some might<br/>
appreciate a heads up that not all of us operate the same way. And<br/>
that it&#39;s OK to explore those differences.~~<br/>
<br/>
Sure!<br/>
I just hope you&#39;re not advocating parents calling their kid&#39;s show &quot;dumb&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I can see where that might happen with older kids, who are used to<br/>
discussing such things in a humorous manner. My kids and I can get<br/>
pretty crass at times. &quot;That is the dumbest show&quot; could get flung<br/>
about at some point. It depends.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s so much circumstance and personality that plays into it. I am<br/>
very careful with my judgements about other people&#39;s choices, even<br/>
when thinking it. I try to examine where that judgement stems from.<br/>
Words like &quot;ugly&quot;, &quot;dumb&quot;, &quot;lame&quot; etc....can get in the way of seeing<br/>
the things that person loves about it.<br/>
<br/>
The idea here isn&#39;t to advocate for people all liking what they&#39;re<br/>
kids like or anything. But I don&#39;t see how it helps people embrace a<br/>
show their children like, that they don&#39;t, by calling it &quot;dumb&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I like to suspend that judgement long enough to get inside their heads<br/>
at least.:)<br/>
<br/>
There are shows I think are pretty lame. But sometimes I can pick<br/>
apart the lameness and see some redeeming quality too. Then I leave<br/>
the room and come have these danged discussions. One would think I am<br/>
dumb for continuing this after eight years. &#39;Cept there are those that<br/>
have done it longer.;)<br/>
<br/>
So maybe &quot;nuts&quot; is a better descriptor.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-522861232">I do however see that so many people don&#39;t do well in a family with<br/>
insensitive behaviors.  There&#39;s almost always at least one child who doesn&#39;t<br/>
fare well.  In my own case, I lived &quot;under the radar&quot; as a sensitive person<br/>
as much as I could so as not to be label &quot;too sensitive.&quot;  I wanted<br/>
acceptance and my real Self lay inert until I left home.  I didn&#39;t know how<br/>
black my depression had gotten until then.<br/>
<br/>
When we explore the differences, you might come across dozens of examples of<br/>
children who fared about the same as I did.<br/>
