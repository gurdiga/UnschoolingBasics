<div id="ygrps-yiv-1217673696">No behavior is &quot;out of the blue&quot;. There is always causation, even if  <br/>
we aren&#39;t seeing it. The trick is to understand them enough to see  <br/>
it, and help. To be honest, everything you&#39;ve posted about your  <br/>
daughter sounds like boredom. When we see this in Breanna, it means  <br/>
that she&#39;s reached the end of a plateau, and she needs a lot of help  <br/>
getting into her new stage because she&#39;s ritualized the old one.<br/>
<br/>
There are a ton of things I could offer, but they work in my house.  <br/>
They won&#39;t necessarily work in yours. You need to drop everything  <br/>
else, housework, cooking, personal time and just BE with her. She  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t have been able to throw away that much food without  you  <br/>
being there and redirecting, providing another way for her to feel  <br/>
fulfilled. As she gets better, then you can start again with the time  <br/>
to do other things. But honestly, that&#39;s the only thing that&#39;s going  <br/>
to help you now. That&#39;s how unschooling will look in your house for a  <br/>
while. And for an alternative viewpoint. $50 isn&#39;t that much. Kids  <br/>
like ours are usually in forty hours of therapy a week, averaging out  <br/>
to $160 an hour. We did that for two years. You&#39;ve actually saved  <br/>
money by this. Okay, that&#39;s a stretch, but honestly, if she was  <br/>
directed, helped, in achieving her needs, you could have recycled  <br/>
those lotions and gels. Get her a big mixing bowl and a gallon of  <br/>
lotion from the dollar store. Let her &#39;waste&#39; that all she wants.  <br/>
Then put it back in.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1019430817">Well I doubt it&#39;s &quot;out of the blue&quot; and here I may part ways with others on<br/>
this board.  Depending upon who you ask, behavior is communication, stimulus<br/>
response or both.  I believe it&#39;s both.  Was she having a hard day?  Did she<br/>
need to have more of your attention?  (For some people, negative attention<br/>
is better than no attention.)  How verbal is she?  Where on the autism<br/>
spectrum is she anyway?<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t say where you were when these things were taking place.  Since I<br/>
train dogs for a living I&#39;ll add this little bit of advice.  A lot of my<br/>
clients complain to me that the dog eats off the counters, or pees in the<br/>
house, or chews the furniture.  I tell them to keep a rolled up newspaper<br/>
around to hit *themselves* over the head when the dog does something wrong.<br/>
Because the OWNER is the one that left the dog alone and unsupervised.  You<br/>
can leave an old dog who has no such issues alone, but if you know your dog<br/>
is a counter-surfer and you leave it alone to take a shower and come back to<br/>
find all the cupcakes you left on the counter gone, how can you blame the<br/>
dog?  It&#39;s your fault....you knew this is the dog&#39;s behavior pattern and you<br/>
set him up to do this.  It&#39;s not fair to blame the dog.  Although it is<br/>
frustrating.<br/>
<br/>
So back to this...what was your daughter trying to tell you with her<br/>
behavior?  Was it &quot;what happens when I do this?&quot;  Was it &quot;what kind of drama<br/>
reward will I get from mom?&quot;  Was it &quot;I&#39;m bored and need stimulation and<br/>
don&#39;t know how to get it any other way?&quot;  Were this my child and I needed to<br/>
get some stuff done, like an on-line class, I think I&#39;d get a hold of one of<br/>
those small indoor trampolines and put it in the room with me, put on some<br/>
music and let her bounce.  I would be there to be with her, but also able to<br/>
do what I need to get done.  Or she&#39;s 14, put her in a bathing suit and put<br/>
her in the bathtub with a big amount of cheap lotion and let her do<br/>
whatever.  Or give her some shower gel and a bath poof and let her &quot;paint&quot;<br/>
the walls.  It can be washed off later.  But I don&#39;t think she can be left<br/>
alone, unsupervised.  This is the crux of your problem.<br/>
<br/>
Very often, problem solving requires us to let go of what we think the<br/>
motivations of others are and really look at the situation.  This can be<br/>
very hard when you are stressed and stretched thin.  I think you need to<br/>
find some respite care so you can get some time to recharge and then you can<br/>
be more fully available to her.  But also, get that book I posted about<br/>
earlier in this thread.  Additionally maybe you could provide some serious<br/>
body movement, like a long walk with her in the mornings so that she gets<br/>
some movement and burns off some of the energy.  If she&#39;s in a constant<br/>
state of &quot;cabin fever&quot; that&#39;s going to make her frustrated.<br/>
<br/>
I wish you luck but I do think there is an answer out there, you are just<br/>
going to have to look for it in different places than you have so far.<br/>

That was my first thought, at the description of dumping stuff in <br/>
the trash, that maybe what dd really wanted was to *touch* it - get <br/>
it all over herself even, and that dumping stuff in the trash was <br/>
the only thing that was even close to &quot;acceptible&quot;. Even though it <br/>
wasn&#39;t, exactly.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder how this girl would feel about massage? Or even just a <br/>
facial if that&#39;s too much to start with. I&#39;m trying to think of some <br/>
things that are highly tactile but also interactive, so mom and kid <br/>
can work on their relationship, too. If she&#39;s into either the <br/>
massage or facial idea there are lots and lots of variations to play <br/>
with. Corn starch is really &quot;fluid&quot; feeling, like oil, for instance, <br/>
without being so messy. Or if you wanted to push the messy envelope <br/>
you could try cremes or gels - even weird things like yogurt. You <br/>
could just do hands or feet, too, if a whole body massage is too <br/>
intimate/intense right off the bat.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s another sensory thing y&#39;all might try together - ever heard <br/>
of a taffy pull? You get to butter your hands and arms and then <br/>
wrestle with a big wad of candy - and then you get to eat it! What <br/>
could be better? Making braided breads can be fun in this way, too, <br/>
without being quite as intense as a taffy-pull. <br/>
<br/>
Woops, lost track of time! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1237490905">~~I tell them to keep a rolled up newspaper<br/>

wrong.~~<br/>
<br/>
That is hilarious!<br/>
<br/>
I have found that most of the things children are blamed for are all<br/>
about the parent&#39;s poor skills or lack of connectedness. I&#39;m going to<br/>
envision myself popping my head with a newspaper now, when I screw up.<br/>
Not because I&#39;ll be trying, but I think that visual is going to stick<br/>
with me! Too funny.<br/>
<br/>
A child with autism, depending on the severity, probably should not be<br/>
left alone! Jalen would be considered &quot;on the spectrum&quot; though I have<br/>
no idea exactly where or what the exact diagnoses would be since we&#39;ve<br/>
never had him diagnosed. Very mild in his case. Though I can relate to<br/>
the feelings of exasperation and complete incompetency.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve sat on the floor crying and thinking &quot;I am NOT the best parent<br/>
for this child&quot; because his issues just put me over the edge sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
Things have gotten SO much better in the last six months. Most of our<br/>
close friends have noticed a huge change. So I wonder if some of the<br/>
&quot;autism&quot; symptoms seem to disappear in time, in a supportive<br/>
environment where the child is allowed to develop in their own time. I<br/>
think he would have been diagnosed, but maybe they&#39;d have been wrong<br/>
because he is just developing slower in some areas.<br/>
<br/>
For a child with true autism, or more severe autism, I really don&#39;t<br/>
see how you could leave them alone. I know that must be exhausting,<br/>
but that IS the reality of where that child is at the moment. I think<br/>
gathering more tools and making the home more of an environment the<br/>
child needs is much better than trying to control constantly.<br/>
<br/>
What did the OP mean by &quot;self-directed&quot; anyway?  Were you leaving her<br/>
to her own devices in spite of the fact that she might need constant<br/>
supervision? That isn&#39;t &quot;self-directed&quot;, that is avoidance.<br/>
<br/>
A child like her might need a LOT of one-on-one and guidance. Rather<br/>
than leaving her to figure it out for herself, be PRESENT and follow<br/>
her lead as to what sound interesting. Try to find a positive outlet<br/>
for whatever need she has at the moment, even if it seems<br/>
&quot;destructive&quot;. Destruction is part of creativity too.<br/>
<br/>
Introduce fun ideas and trust her to pick and choose. Don&#39;t leave her<br/>
on her own though, if she can&#39;t handle that at this point.<br/>
<br/>
You have my sympathy. It&#39;s really hard for me to maintain my calm with<br/>
Jalen at times and he is so mild compared to many children I read<br/>
about here and at other lists. Hang in there!<br/>

smaller, it was the door handles in the house. Not a major problem <br/>
unless you can&#39;t get into a room because the handle falls off in your <br/>

things that don&#39;t work to take apart and satisfy his curiosity. I just <br/>
asked him to please ask if it is ok first before he disassembles <br/>

My brother was the same way when he was growing up. Nothing in my <br/>

out to be the one person everyone went to to fix their things! He was <br/>
fascinated by how things worked, and although it took many years before <br/>
he learned how to put things back together again, he did learn a lot in <br/>
the process. I know Caleb is the same way, and want to let him explore, <br/>

&gt; Don&#39;t know if this has ever been gone over, but my son is and <br/>
&gt; always has<br/>
&gt; been a disassembler. That is, he loves to take things apart. When <br/>
&gt; he was<br/>
&gt; smaller, it was the door handles in the house. Not a major problem<br/>
&gt; unless you can&#39;t get into a room because the handle falls off in your<br/>
&gt; hand. He progresses through the years to taking apart a printer, <br/>
&gt; many of<br/>
&gt; his toys, his computer, and I have always tried to give him some older<br/>
&gt; things that don&#39;t work to take apart and satisfy his curiosity. I just<br/>
&gt; asked him to please ask if it is ok first before he disassembles<br/>
&gt; something. Mainly because I found his electric alarm clock taken <br/>
&gt; apart,<br/>
&gt; yet still plugged in! It was also a bit unnerving when he took <br/>
&gt; apart his<br/>
&gt; computer, when it was something simple that I could have fixed, but <br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; after he took it apart.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I build my own computers and have tons of parts laying around, and <br/>
&gt; full<br/>
&gt; computer CPUs that I ave given him in the past, but I was wondering if<br/>
&gt; anyone knew what kind of things I SHOULDN&#39;T let him take apart. I know<br/>
&gt; some electronic stuff has capacitors that can hold an electric charge<br/>
&gt; for years. He really wants to take apart a CRT monitor, but I am not<br/>
&gt; sure if this would be safe, or if I would be setting him up for<br/>
&gt; electrocution. Anyone know if they are similar to TVs in this <br/>
&gt; respect? I<br/>
&gt; want to give him the opportunity to satisfy this need of his. I <br/>
&gt; know it<br/>
&gt; is important to him, but need to make sure that he does it safely.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My brother was the same way when he was growing up. Nothing in my<br/>
&gt; mother&#39;s house was safe from being taken apart, but in the end he <br/>
&gt; turned<br/>
&gt; out to be the one person everyone went to to fix their things! He was<br/>
&gt; fascinated by how things worked, and although it took many years <br/>
&gt; before<br/>
&gt; he learned how to put things back together again, he did learn a <br/>
&gt; lot in<br/>
&gt; the process. I know Caleb is the same way, and want to let him <br/>
&gt; explore,<br/>
&gt; but in a safe way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-438992935">That&#39;s what I needed to know! We are just going to have to find some <br/>
other things he can take apart that are safer to handle. I told him I <br/>
needed to find out if it was safe FIRST before doing anything with one. <br/>
The time he took apart his alarm clock and I found it was PLUGGED IN, <br/>
kind of freaked me out a bit. I don&#39;t mind him taking apart things that <br/>
won&#39;t hurt or possibly kill him, and knew that monitors could be very <br/>
dangerous.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1393766140">My brother was the same way, he took everything apart from the time  <br/>
he was very small. My mom just started picking up stuff from the  <br/>
curbside trash that people would throw away, as well as yardsales,  <br/>
and he had an entire closet of stuff to take apart when he felt like it.<br/>
It was wonderful for him, because he always struggled in school, the  <br/>
way they taught didn&#39;t mesh with the way his brain worked. But this  <br/>
gave him practical experience and he soared through classes in high  <br/>
school.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-716814950">My dh says that you can discharge amonitor by using a screwdriver with an insulated handle and a wire running from the metal on the screwdriver to the ground or a screw on an electrical socket and using the screwdriver to pop the center cap thingy off. ( was that scientific or what? ) <br/>
   <br/>
  He also says DONT TRY THIS AT HOME!!!  and suggests asking a computer repair shop that works on monitors or possibly a tv repair shop if they can discharge it for you. <br/>

likes the sensation but not so much human touch, is experimenting <br/>
with massage tools: back scratchers, those beaded seat-cover <br/>
thingies people put in their cars (imagine sliding back and forth on <br/>
one on the floor or bed), massage rollers, even rolling balls and <br/>
other roundish objects over various body parts. For that matter, <br/>
exercise balls (any kind of ball, really) come in a bunch of <br/>
different sizes and can be used as a sort of self-massage. It feels <br/>
different to lie face up vs down vs on one&#39;s side on each different <br/>
size. A cheaper variation on all this would be lengths of pvc pipe <br/>
in different diameters, some wrapped in cloth, some &quot;hard&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Foam yoga blocks are handy in this way, too - not so much rolling, <br/>
but you can balance and stretch different body parts across them in <br/>
different ways. Lots of stimulation. A metal folding chair, too, has <br/>
lots of options for stretching and rubbing the body, and can be <br/>
padded with blankets or left &quot;hard&quot; depending on the body in <br/>
question. <br/>
<br/>
Electric massagers are also really interesting and can often be <br/>
found at yardsales and flea markets. Lots of weird attatchments, <br/>
too, that give a variety of different sensations. The plug-in types <br/>
have more oomph, but may not be as &quot;safe&quot; for some kids. <br/>
