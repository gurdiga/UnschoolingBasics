<div id="ygrps-yiv-1006164311">&quot;I&#39;ve only been deschooling for a few months and the kids are still<br/>
very young, so I&#39;m sure there&#39;s hope for me to learn to trust that<br/>
they will learn what they need when they need it, without me hovering<br/>
and worrying.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Part of really getting unschooling, is you don&#39;t worry anymore. I <br/>
don&#39;t try to &quot;gently expose&quot; my kids to academic subjects of any <br/>
kind, I DO try to expose them to as much of LIFE as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Do math and reading surround us? If not, why would we need to learn <br/>
them? If so, how could a child NOT learn it? That which we use in <br/>
every day life becomes something we learn about and use. If your <br/>
child learns reading and math concepts through fingerplays and <br/>
dancing, more power to her/him!!<br/>
Play is powerful, more powerful than most realize. It frees the mind <br/>
to imagine, dream and create. A mind that can imagine is far more <br/>
useful than a mind filled with knowledge. Trust your children.<br/>

ARGH! Yeah, well, tell that to my dh, would ya? Because we just had that <br/>
argument last night, and it wasn&#39;t pretty. GRRRRR.....<br/>
<br/>
Just when I think he gets it, he launches into one of these, &quot;How are <br/>
they going to get exposed to it...&quot; trips. And this happened, no lie, 10 <br/>
minutes after my oldest (7) who really likes playing with numbers and <br/>
math in the car, says, &quot;Mama, I want to do some written math. Can you <br/>
write down some math puzzles for me?&quot;  Duh, hello! Natural desire right <br/>
there, and he&#39;s sitting there telling me it&#39;s impossible.<br/>
<br/>
Turns into he&#39;s not worried about her math &quot;now&quot; but he is worried that <br/>
she&#39;s not reading. Grrrrr......<br/>
<br/>
Turns out the same thing that makes me confident makes him crazy: we <br/>
both know she *can* read, but is choosing not to. I know that she&#39;s <br/>
smart and curious and that when she&#39;s ready to do it, she will and no <br/>
amount of pushing is going to change that. He actually had the nerve to <br/>
use the word &quot;lazy&quot; last night, then claims he only said it because I <br/>
backed him into a corner.<br/>
<br/>
Gosh, I&#39;m mad. I really need to stop typing now.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think this is strictly true, and I want to point it out before  <br/>
people who are prone to worrying decide they couldn&#39;t possibly unschool.<br/>
 <br/>
I think getting unschooling is knowing in your heart that one doesn&#39;t need  <br/>
academic subjects to grow, learn, be happy, and have successful (whatever that  <br/>
means) lives.<br/>
 <br/>
Most of us worry, even after doing this many, many years and having a  happy, <br/>
intelligent kid in front of us. Homeschooling in general is an amazing  leap <br/>
of faith in a society that tells us that Education is supposed to be done  by <br/>
Professionals. In unschooling, you&#39;re not only trusting yourself (hard  <br/>
enough!), but your kids!!!!  I mean, who the hell does that. Part of being  an <br/>
unschooler is worrying, and being an early unschooler (even if you&#39;re living  it <br/>
every day and KNOW it&#39;s working) means probably having moments where you feel  <br/>
like screaming, &quot;What am I doing to my kids&#39; lives?!&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
I am certain that parents who have late readers worry, even if they know in  <br/>
their hearts that it will come. It doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re not getting <br/>
unschooling.  Or that you don&#39;t trust your child. We still live in a society that has <br/>
many  expectations of us, and occasionally we&#39;ll buy into them, albeit briefly.  <br/>
<br/>
The worry isn&#39;t all-consuming, and after you do it for a while, when it  does <br/>
come up it&#39;s surprising.  But all parents worry sometimes. Doesn&#39;t  mean you <br/>
don&#39;t get unschooling.<br/>
