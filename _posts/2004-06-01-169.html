<div id="ygrps-yiv-657097306">Hello There,<br/>
<br/>
I have just joined this list and wanted to send an intro - I am mom to<br/>
Aline, 5.7 and Nicky 3.4.  We live in Massachusetts and I consider us<br/>
unschoolers thus far as I follow my kids&#39; leads and try to help provide them<br/>
with opportunities to learn - books, videos, materials - based around their<br/>
interests and where they lead.<br/>
<br/>
I am still learning every day about what other folks who are unschooling are<br/>
doing, which I find fascinating.  My biggest question at the moment is how<br/>
much diversity - and tolerance for that diversity - is there among<br/>
unschooling families in terms of approach - at what point does someone<br/>
consider themselves &quot;eclectic&quot; rather than &quot;unschooling&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1593112958">Thanks, Alyce,<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate your reply, and it caused me to think further about what my<br/>
question really is.  It could be that as a beginner I don&#39;t quite get the<br/>
philosophy of many unschoolers - which is why I&#39;m on this list, to increase<br/>
my understanding - but what I am wondering is what you or other more<br/>
experienced homeschoolers think of as your role in terms of facilitating<br/>
learning for your kid(s) and is that pretty much the same for all<br/>
unschoolers or does it differ.  In other words, how do you generally go<br/>
about digging up possible resources that your kids might be interested in<br/>
for things they&#39;ve expressed interest in, or thinking up ways they might<br/>
enjoy expanding those interests.  And how much do you leave up to them?  Is<br/>
this something that has varied over your years of unschooling with insight<br/>
you have gained in the process of unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
I ask because, as someone new to this, I wonder how to gauge if I am doing<br/>
too much, not enough, or if there are different ways out there that other<br/>
unschoolers use to help their children further their interests that I&#39;m not<br/>
aware of.  So when my 5 1/2 yr old daughter for instance gets interested in<br/>
mummies and ancient Egypt, she has many wonderful ways in which she &quot;learns&quot;<br/>
about that - she asks me to cut up old sheets into strips so she can figure<br/>
out how to wrap herself up like one, she takes some construction paper and<br/>
string and pencil and comes up with her own &quot;mummy game&quot; that we play over<br/>
and over.  My tendency would be to look for books and videos from the<br/>
library at her level on mummies and Egypt that she might be interested in<br/>
(or not, it&#39;s up to her).  I might find a game in the store where she gets a<br/>
pretend mummy to take the organs out of and wrap up, and may look for a<br/>
website with games or info on Egypt and mummies.  I am wondering if this is<br/>
what other unschoolers do...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
<br/>
Joan<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That sounds like something I would do, but I wouldn&#39;t do it like it <br/>
was something I HAD to do.  When interests come, they rise to the <br/>
surface for me, and I suddenly notice things I wouldn&#39;t have before.<br/>
I don&#39;t think I would purposely look for a mummy game, but something <br/>
usually comes across my path that I might consider getting.  Usually <br/>
at the thrift store.<br/>
If questions about mummies came up, in the day, I would look for <br/>
cool web sites, I would probably remember the next time we were at <br/>
the library to try to find some books that looked fun and <br/>
interesting about mummies.  I would probably notice &quot;The Mummy&quot; in <br/>
the video store and think about renting it.   <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t do all that in a week.  It happens over time.  If I did <br/>
do all that in a week, I think my child would think I had some <br/>
vested interest in getting them to learn about mummies.<br/>
If we were going on a trip to Ireland, I would probably get all <br/>
kinds of information in a weeks time, because I really would have a <br/>
vested interest in learning about the country in a short time span, <br/>
but with mummies or anything, we have our whole life.<br/>
My dd Carly whose 13 has been interested in presidents and first <br/>
ladies since she was 7.  I still come across stuff that I think <br/>
might interest her.  Not because I want her to learn more, but <br/>
because she is interested and I like to make her happy.  <br/>
Hope this made sense.<br/>

do the research or legwork for them. Cameron has watched the &quot;mode&quot; I get into

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>THESE are really good questions that hit right at the center of what <br/>
makes unschooling what it is. The easy quick answer is that the <br/>
parents&#39; role varies depending on the child (and on the parent).  I <br/>
think &quot;pretty much the same for all unschoolers&quot; would be a very <br/>
misleading answer. My role isn&#39;t the same even for my three kids.<br/>
<br/>
Still, I bet there are some general principles that all unschoolers <br/>
abide by and maybe together we can come up with a useful list.<br/>
<br/>
What is the role of the unschooling parent?<br/>
<br/>
1. Show respect for all of a child&#39;s interests equally.<br/>
2. Keep the child in mind as I go through life, so that I notice things <br/>
that might be of interest to that child.<br/>
3. Find ways to include the child in my own daily life - live a more <br/>
&quot;open-book&quot; life than the norm.<br/>
4. Follow up on things the child is interested in - and do this in a <br/>
wide variety of ways, not only by &quot;getting him a book on it.&quot;<br/>
5. Live a family life that is rich with experiences of a variety of <br/>
kinds both at home and outside the home.<br/>
6. Have resources around the home that are interesting and stimulating <br/>
- things that will encourage exploration of ideas.<br/>
7. Discuss things - spend time in conversation. This is probably <br/>
overall the most important parental &quot;action&quot; involved in unschooling.<br/>
8. Have a &#39;playful&#39; attitude - play together, have fun, appreciate the <br/>
amazing world around you. Don&#39;t be cynical, be able to be amazed and <br/>
find the world a fascinating place. THIS is the most important <br/>
&quot;attitude&quot; for an unschooling parent.<br/>
9. Be self-aware of your own thinking and behavior. Purposely stretch <br/>
your imagination - question your own assumptions, check your own <br/>
automatic impulses.<br/>
10. Be very observant of what your child is really doing - don&#39;t view <br/>
him/her in a shallow superficial way. Recognize that there is a reason <br/>
for a child&#39;s actions, that a child is &#39;born to learn&#39; and is always <br/>
learning. Get to know your child&#39;s own special favored ways of learning<br/>
11. Wholeheartedly support a child&#39;s passions EVEN if, to you, they <br/>
don&#39;t look like &quot;education.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1345091292">This mummies and ancient Egypt stuff all sounds great. I&#39;d warn you off <br/>
of overdoing it - she may want to &quot;play&quot; Egypt, but not be interested <br/>
in reading about Egypt, for example. There are GREAT activity books on <br/>
ancient civilizations - with cool ideas in them- building a pyramid out <br/>
of sugar cubes, making a Senet game of your own, my friend and her kids <br/>
even mummified a chicken once - went through the whole process. Every <br/>
kid is different, maybe yours would get all excited over reading a <br/>
nonfiction book about Egypt. But there are also stories - the &quot;Egyptian <br/>
Cinderella,&quot; is one.<br/>
<br/>
BUT - don&#39;t get too excited that she&#39;s interested in something that is <br/>
clearly &quot;educational&quot; and go overboard in supporting that interest over <br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
My girls were very wrapped up in &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; for about a year. If <br/>
you&#39;ve seen it, you can probably imagine that most people probably <br/>
don&#39;t think of that as &quot;educational.&quot; But I supported that interest and <br/>
we taped the show EVERY day so they wouldn&#39;t miss it and we went to the <br/>
anime store at the mall over and over so they could browse through all <br/>
the merchandise and an unschooling friend ran into a huge supply of <br/>
Sailor Moon dolls, posters, paper plates, and all kinds of things on <br/>
sale and packed them up in a box and mailed them to us. Some of the <br/>
things the kids learned from all that focus on Sailor Moon were obvious <br/>
ones - they wanted to buy related things, so there was a lot of money <br/>
counting and sales tax adding and budgeting of allowances involved, for <br/>
example. But, there were MANY other things they learned - they spent <br/>
ENDLESS hours discussing the behavior of the characters - who did what <br/>
and why and was it right or wrong and so on. And, if nothing else, it <br/>
was a passion that three sisters had in common - three kids who <br/>
otherwise had very very different interests. I&#39;m sure there was <br/>
something wonderful and empowering for the girls, too, in watching the <br/>
rather &quot;silly&quot; young girls turn into superpowered &quot;Sailor Scouts.&quot; In <br/>
fact, it was incredible how many connections they made, all the time, <br/>
of things that happened in their lives. My youngest daughter even got <br/>
an interest in Japanese and (here is an unschooling mom&#39;s role in <br/>
action) I had a friend whose kids went to a Japanese language school <br/>
and I found out that their summer program was more of an introduction <br/>
to the culture and language - doing fun activities like calligraphy and <br/>
papermaking and sushi making, along with learning the basics of the <br/>
language. So my daughter spent a summer doing that. But that is just <br/>
the most obvious &quot;educational&quot; thing that came out of it - the point is <br/>
that you just never know how one thing is going to lead to another.<br/>
<br/>
Supporting a passion for Sailor Moon was a good exercise for me, as an <br/>
unschooling parent because at first it was a bit difficult to not be <br/>
irritated by the show - it didn&#39;t have obvious redeeming value and the <br/>
sound of it tends to be very hard on my ears. And the related <br/>
merchandise seemed pretty &quot;junky&quot; to me. I kept my opinion to myself <br/>
and supported their interest anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Supporting a passionate interest in ancient Egypt would be easy in <br/>
comparison &lt;G&gt;.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep, that&#39;s it.  And as far as doing too much - she&#39;ll let you know <br/>
if she&#39;s had enough.  :)  We went through the Egypt stage too.  It <br/>
was fun.  We made home-made clay on the stove (measuring <br/>
ingredients, etc.), then using a book as reference made canopic jars <br/>
and internal organs - careful to match the organs with the correct <br/>
jars.  It was a disgusting hoot.  Lots of fun.<br/>
<br/>
So whatever the interest is at the time... and watch the directions <br/>
it goes!  It&#39;s so fun to watch things evolve.  I had mentioned <br/>
earlier how my daughter (now 14) started with an interest in fashion <br/>
design - signed up for a class (classes are not precluded if they <br/>
are desired and fit in with what&#39;s going on! it&#39;s up to the child) <br/>
and now has gone on to explore small business management and <br/>
accounting for the purpose of understanding how to run a wedding <br/>
planning business.  All this from browsing through Vogue in line at <br/>
the grocery store.<br/>
<br/>
And if any of your daughter&#39;s interests open the door to a &quot;field <br/>
trip&quot; go for it!  It&#39;s terrific fun to get out and hit museums or <br/>
businesses while the rest of the world is at school or work.  Having <br/>
the place to yourself is great.<br/>
<br/>
brainstorming - that&#39;s the ticket.  And again, when she&#39;s had her <br/>
fill of it, she&#39;ll let you know.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, the places they will go.  I think the point IS supporting the <br/>
passion no matter what our personal opinion is.  lol.  It&#39;s not <br/>
unlike the food thing.  All desires and interests are valid and <br/>
should be supported.  If we act as if &quot;that&#39;s boring or has no <br/>
redeeming value&quot; then we&#39;re doing just what the schools do.  Telling <br/>
them A is valuable and B is not.  If we support them through Sailor <br/>
Moon, etc... then they&#39;ll feel free to explore *whatever* interests <br/>
them as it occurs.  No squelching!  :)  No sucking the joy out of <br/>
things!  That&#39;s what we don&#39;t want to do.  We don&#39;t have to *get* <br/>
it.  And truly, you never know where any of it will lead.  It always <br/>
lands somewhere interesting and unexpected.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1656341282"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; It could be that as a beginner I don&#39;t quite get the philosophy of <br/>
 </span></blockquote>many unschoolers - which is why I&#39;m on this list, to increase my <br/>
understanding - but what I am wondering is what you or other more<br/>
experienced homeschoolers think of as your role in terms of <br/>
facilitating learning for your kid(s) and is that pretty much the <br/>
same for all unschoolers or does it differ.  In other words, how do <br/>
you generally go about digging up possible resources that your kids <br/>
might be interested in for things they&#39;ve expressed interest in, or <br/>
thinking up ways they might enjoy expanding those interests.  And <br/>
how much do you leave up to them?  Is this something that has varied <br/>
over your years of unschooling with insight you have gained in the <br/>
process of unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
******You are your children&#39;s guide, but think about what a guide <br/>
does. If you go to a museum and a guide takes you to the different <br/>
displays he doesn&#39;t force you to look at each piece and study it and <br/>
write a report. He simply points it out to you and allows you the <br/>
freedom to put as much attention and effort into that piece as you <br/>
choose. He doesn&#39;t tell you that he will show you the next piece if <br/>
you say &quot;please&quot; or tell you that you don&#39;t get to see the next <br/>
piece because you didn&#39;t say &quot;thank you&quot; when he showed you the <br/>
prior piece. He doesn&#39;t tell you to be quiet and stay in a straight <br/>
line with your hands at your side. He doesn&#39;t monitor you to see <br/>
what you&#39;ve learned and degrade you if you were not interested. He <br/>
doesn&#39;t put conditions on sharing his knowledge. What he does do is <br/>
share his joy (if he&#39;s a good guide) of the museum and trust you to <br/>
take away what you will from the experience. That is the type of <br/>
guide our children need and deserve. They need a guide that trusts <br/>
them, respects them and is there to answer any questions they might <br/>
have about this great world of ours.<br/>
