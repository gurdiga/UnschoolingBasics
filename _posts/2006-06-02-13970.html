<div id="ygrps-yiv-2039706130">How did you all handle crossing the bridge between traditional parenting and <br/>
the mindful parenting that is a big part of unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
Specifically, here&#39;s my issue. My 2 year old son and I were at a La Leche <br/>
League meeting the other day and there was another 2 year old boy there. <br/>
They, of course, had their little back and forth periods of wanting a toy <br/>
that the other one had (community property, by the way, not either child&#39;s <br/>
toys) and they played out just fine. At one point, though (and this was <br/>
toward the end of the meeting, and likely the end of my son&#39;s threshold for <br/>
boring meetings such as this) my son went over to the other boy and wrenched <br/>
a toy from his hand with some sort of super strength and gave him a push <br/>
backward (which I&#39;ve never seen him do before). I don&#39;t know why or where it <br/>
came from, but I went over to my son and wrenched the toy from his hand to <br/>
give back to the other boy and during our struggle, he hit himself in the <br/>
eye with it.<br/>
<br/>
I felt HORRIBLE. I felt icky and still kind of do. How do you make amends <br/>
with a child this age (what kind of words do you use)? How long do you wait <br/>
to talk about it after you&#39;ve had an &quot;incident&quot;? By the way, how do you <br/>
handle sharing issues when it requires stepping in? I&#39;m usually pretty okay <br/>
with the RU ideas and parenting philosophies and have let go of many <br/>
controls I had before. However, sometimes the sharing thing confuses me - <br/>
and ESPECIALLY in a situation with traditional parents I&#39;m kind of at a loss <br/>
regarding how to step in... Thanks in advance. I&#39;m also posting this at <br/>
AlwaysUnschooled, by the way.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think I would apologize to my son after this.  Because kids are so <br/>
blissfully in the moment, it&#39;s not too likely he&#39;s going to hang onto <br/>
a grudge against you, but you know him way better than I do.  If he <br/>
were still angry with you, I would wholeheartedly apologize to him in <br/>
a way that he can understand.  I would tell him I made a mistake and <br/>
that I hope he can forgive me.  (I have a little practice with this <br/>
sort of thing, can you tell?)  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
But, no matter what a kid&#39;s age, we really need to meet him where <br/>
he&#39;s at.  There is no such thing as &quot;sharing&quot; for a kid that age, and <br/>
that&#39;s probably why he felt okay to hike over there and wrench that <br/>
toy out of the other kid&#39;s hand.  What must have been very confusing <br/>
for him, though, was you saying that it was wrong for him to do <br/>
that...and then you went and did the exact, same thing!  That&#39;d just <br/>
about blow my mind, that&#39;s for sure!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
When my son was wee and got real attached to things that didn&#39;t <br/>
belong to him, I did my best to work it out with whoever the thing <br/>
belonged to so that we could leave with it and then get it back to <br/>
them another time (maybe even in 5 minutes).  Distraction also works <br/>
sometimes.  Whatever it takes to try to keep the peace.  Little kids <br/>
just do not have the capacity to share, and we should not be forcing <br/>
them to do more than they can do!  Even &quot;traditional&quot; parents could <br/>
understand and agree with that, I&#39;m sure!  I&#39;ve worked that very kind <br/>
of thing out with my very mainstream SIL, and she didn&#39;t seem to <br/>
judge me about it at all (well, not that I was aware of anyway).<br/>
<br/>
But, even if she did, my ONLY concern is the well being and welfare <br/>
of my kid and his joy and peace and serenity.  I really can let go of <br/>
what other folks think of me when I remind myself that what they <br/>
think of me isn&#39;t nearly as important as how my son is <br/>
feeling.  Being a Libra, I use the scale to weigh the two.  There&#39;s no contest!<br/>
<br/>
Anyhooo, I hope that&#39;s a little helpful.<br/>

  A child will let you know when he&#39;s ready to share. He&#39;ll share! &lt;g&gt; <br/>
Until then, he&#39;s not ready. Don&#39;t force it. It&#39;ll work against you.<br/>
<br/>
 I agree with Marji: apologize as soon as possible.<br/>
<br/>
  But in this particular situation, you both should probably have left <br/>
20 minutes earlier. You might want to start looking for his signs <br/>
showing he&#39;s just about ready to melt down.<br/>
<br/>
  He was probably hungry or tired or just over all the mom-talk that <br/>
day. That was two year old speak for: &quot;I&#39;m tired, hungry, or ready to <br/>
go home.&quot; Until he has better communication skills, you need to learn <br/>
to speak two-year-old! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

was about a year and a half old.  We were at some mom/kid thing that <br/>
we used to go to about every week.  Liam really liked it &#39;cause they <br/>
had cool toys that we didn&#39;t have that he really dug playing <br/>
with.  We moms would all hang around and talk (well, I would mostly <br/>
disagree, but that&#39;s another story!).  Anyway, one time we had just <br/>
gotten there and I had just set my butt down on some little chair, <br/>
but Liam had clearly decided he did *not* want to be there.  So, what <br/>
he did was he found my sling and my backpack (amongst all the other <br/>
moms&#39; things) and dragged them over to me.  He didn&#39;t say one <br/>
word.  His message was loud and clear, though:  &quot;Let&#39;s GO!&quot;  He never <br/>
wanted to go back again, either!  What a guy!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I did apologize and kissed and hugged him and we went into another <br/>
room to look at the baby pictures on the wall, etc. I just don&#39;t know if he <br/>
*got* it that I was sorry, but, no, he doesn&#39;t *seem* to be holding a <br/>

usually is very willing to share and offer things to other kids. I guess I <br/>
just keep falling back into the trap of wanting him to look like a <br/>
*well-behaved* child - something I&#39;m trying to stop caring about. I&#39;m <br/>
reading Alfie Kohn&#39;s &quot;Unconditional Parenting&quot; right now and it&#39;s starting <br/>
to sink in and open my eyes, but I need to slow down in social situations <br/>
and focus on him, not the other parents.<br/>

Thanks for the tips.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1875780835">I am honest with my children when I make a mistake.  I explain what I <br/>
did, why it was wrong and apologize with the hope that I&#39;ll learn from <br/>

<br/>
In your situation, I might say something like &#39;I am so sorry you got <br/>
hurt.  I made a mistake.  I shouldn&#39;t have tried to get the toy from <br/>
you like that.  I should have asked you nicely for it.  I know you <br/>
want to play with the toy, but you cannot take something away from <br/>
someone else and it&#39;s really unacceptable to hurt someone by pushing <br/>
him down.  Let&#39;s make sure this little boy is okay and then we can <br/>
find another toy that you can play with.&#39;  Or something like that.<br/>
<br/>
I apologize as soon as I realize I&#39;ve made a mistake.  It&#39;s usually <br/>
helpful for my children to see how my emotions and reactions are mixed <br/>
together.  Plus, I&#39;ve found that when I begin apologizing, any <br/>
negative emotions are tossed aside.  I feel humbled and can act more <br/>
rationally.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-614690091">This reminds me of a time when my boy was little and he was yelling <br/>
at me and I yelled at him to not yell at me!! Aaak! I stopped myself <br/>
in mid yell and said, &quot;Oh no, look at mommy, I&#39;m yelling at you to <br/>
not yell at me! That&#39;s not right. That doesn&#39;t make sense! I made a <br/>
mistake and I&#39;m sorry.&quot; and my boy looked at me with a lightbulb <br/>
going off in his head and he said,&quot;yeah, mommy, don&#39;t yell at me.&quot; <br/>
and it was like I put into words what he already knew about the <br/>
situation. I wasn&#39;t being respectful to him. It&#39;s not right to yell <br/>
at another person to get them to not yell at you. He was just too <br/>
little to put it into words. I felt like it was important to say <br/>
sorry and admit my mistake, but also put into words what the mistake <br/>
was. It seemed to help him. And me. <br/>

I would cut out 90% of the words here when talking to a 2 year old. I like the idea of using less words related to their age. A two year old may start to tune out after a while, So &quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot; is probably sufficient.<br/>
I would definately not say this part during my apology:<br/>

Later, when all is calm, I would talk briefly about grabbing. I&#39;ve had people apologize to me and then in the same breath almost, point out what *I* did wrong, which somehow diminishes the apology. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I did that but You...&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Telling a child a reason a situation became difficult is completely different than apologizing for hurting a child. <br/>
Accidentally hurting someone has NOTHING to do with what happened before. I apologized recently to my DH for yelling. Even if DH did something awful that does not give me free license to scream and yell. <br/>
I can apologize for one thing without implying that the other person made me do it. That excuse is used for horrible justifications. If she hadn&#39;t been wearing a short skirt and high heels, she wouldn&#39;t have gotten assaulted. If she had just listened I wouldn&#39;t have had to hit her, If you had just put away the dishes I wouldn&#39;t have had to yell in the first place and crap like that. If the two seperate statements are put into one paragraph, then the but is implied because the child will then put them together into If I hadn&#39;t tried to take away the toy then Mom wouldn&#39;t have tried to give it back accidentally hurting me in the process.<br/>
&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t like the method of glossing over just <br/>
because they are young. &gt;&gt;<br/>
***********How is keeping explanations on a developmental level glossing over? <br/>

*************Again, I&#39;m not singling you out, I&#39;m discussing something that was put forth to the list.

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ah, but you have two things going on here.  You have your apology which<br/>
truly is separate from the incident that began with how you came to hit your<br/>
son with a toy.  To him (and to me) they *are* two separate incidents.  He<br/>
grabbed a toy from another child (first incident)  You grabbed the toy from<br/>
him and hit him in the head (second incident)  You apologized for the second<br/>
incident, but linked it to the first one by talking about it.  Therefore in<br/>
his little mind he thinks that he got hit by the toy because he took the toy<br/>
from another child.<br/>
<br/>
Also talks like you had following the &quot;but&quot; of your apology are something<br/>
that should be done one on one later when he is calm, not emotionally<br/>
charged and you can do with his attention not being on his bonked head.  You<br/>
could even start the conversation with something like, &quot;Everyone sure liked<br/>
that one toy today didn&#39;t they?  I wonder if we could find a few more of<br/>
them to put in the LLL toybag so that more kids can play with them and there<br/>
maybe we can avert some struggles next time.&quot; and then go about with a talk<br/>
about taking turns and how when there is only one we have to share.  Then<br/>
call whoever is in charge of the LLL toybag and ask if they know where that<br/>
one toy came from.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m having my own issues with LLL this week and seriously considering<br/>
retiring as a Leader.  It&#39;s the moms that are keeping me from just throwing<br/>
my hat in and saying, &quot;Die you wretched beast!&quot;  But one of the issues that<br/>
I have had for a while now has been the shift from &quot;unschooly breastfeeding&quot;<br/>
to &quot;schooly discipline.&quot;  If you think about how babies and toddlers are<br/>
respected in regards to breastfeeding - on cue, self weaning, no clocks,<br/>
meet needs, etc and then how suddenly there are all these rules about how<br/>
they are supposed to behave and act and learn.  I&#39;ve been looking at some of<br/>
the material lately for &quot;gentle discipline&quot; and it truly reads like a &quot;how<br/>
to prepare your child so that they will fit into school&quot; program.  I&#39;ve<br/>
really seen unstructured breastfeeding as the first part of a natural step<br/>
towards unschooling!<br/>

I must respectfully disagree.  I do not consider that &#39;but&#39; to be<br/>
invalidating my apology.  My apology would be for MY bad behavior<br/>
not apologizing for the child&#39;s behavior.  I believe if you don&#39;t<br/>
tell a child what made the situation bad, they may not understand<br/>
what the apology is about, or what even caused the whole incident in<br/>
the first place.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Possibly what caused the whole incident in the first place was to not <br/>
leave a little sooner!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m sorry I tried to wrench that toy from your hand. That was wrong,&quot; <br/>
would have been enough.<br/>
<br/>
--=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I don&#39;t like the method of glossing over just because they are young.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Not glossing over, just not going on & on & on & on. A simple apology <br/>
 from you might have made a HUGE difference. For a two year old, a nine <br/>
year old, or a 43 year old! You were wrong. Let him hear that without <br/>
all the other fluff. If he knows even *you* make mistakes, he&#39;ll feel <br/>
empowered to do better and be better too.<br/>
<br/>
*Later* you could talk about reading his cues better---or if he&#39;s <br/>
feeling overwhelmed that he can come to you to leave and that you&#39;d DO <br/>
that immediately.<br/>
<br/>
*Later* you can discuss *why* it&#39;s wrong to wrench things from others <br/>
or to yell or ...<br/>
<br/>
*Later* you can brainstorm about other possible solutions.<br/>
<br/>
But *at the time* just saying &quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot; should suffice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1906748309">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
just could do with some new advice,<br/>
<br/>
we&#39;ve just become relaxed about food and my 8 year old is enjoying eating <br/>
sweets without restriction.<br/>
<br/>
I have noticed that after eating them he starts swearing/shouting/acting out <br/>
ALOT more than normal.  I had up until recently limited his intake of <br/>
certain ingredients in foods because of this, but of course now dont want <br/>
to.<br/>
<br/>
He says he doesnt really like the way he feels, (although i&#39;m not sure how <br/>
much i have influenced this opinion), and has said he wont eat sweets after <br/>
6 as they stop him from feeling tired.  Today he wanted sweets after 6, I <br/>
reminded him of his decision and left it at that.......he had the sweets.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just wondering how I should react when he starts behaving differently.  <br/>
SHould I mention the sweets?  SHould I keep reminding him of his decision, <br/>
(not sure if he made this to please me).  I really dont like sweets and so <br/>
dont want to particularly eat them with him, is that ok?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2145901410">HI there,<br/>
   <br/>
  I belong to the Feingold Association (feingold.org) and we are all positive that sugar and &quot;sweets&quot; aren&#39;t the problem with bad behavior such as swearing, shouting, crankiness, etc.  It&#39;s the fake stuff in the foods.  My kids eat sugary things frequently, and love chocolate, but they only eat natural products with nothing artificial, or homemade goodies, and the worse that we get is a belly ache from eating a little too much at a time.  The fakes are what send them off.<br/>
<br/>
  Basically, we eliminate artificial colors and flavors as well as the preservatives BHA, BHT, and TBHQ.  (All of these preservatives, fake colors, and fake flavors are petroleum based.) I had many of the same concerns that you mentioned with my children when they ate certain things, and this program has really helped.<br/>
   <br/>
  Are the sweets homemade?  Do they have anything artificial (example: M&M&#39;s in choc chip cookies, or artifical vanilla or other flavored extracts?) Are the sweets storebought? Are they full of fake colors or use artificial flavorings and vanillin?  These things will be listed on the labels of the foods. Could it be corn syrup causing the problem? CS doesn&#39;t affect everyone but some folks it does cause an allergic reaction close to the behavior you are talking about.  <br/>

<br/>
&quot;But&quot; is a coordinating conjunction that indicates exception or <br/>

everything that came before was overwhelmed or overshadowed by the <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I couldn&#39;t agree more with this statement.  I recently found out that<br/>
&quot;natural and artificial flavors&quot; is a keyword for MSG!  It&#39;s all the dyes,<br/>
flavorings, and perservatives that are prevelant in mass produced<br/>
convenience foods that are a problem.<br/>
<br/>
But to reply to the OP.  Your son may need a few experimentations with<br/>
sweets to truly understand that he doesn&#39;t like the effects of certain<br/>
products on his body.  And this is a fairly new concept for him (and you.)<br/>
It&#39;s those repeated tapes that Kelly mentioned this week.  We still hear<br/>
those things going through our heads and unfortunately, we can&#39;t just &quot;tape<br/>
over them&quot; and forget what used to be there.  When I was in college I hung<br/>
out with an, well, eclectic crowd.  It was the theatre people.  So we had a<br/>
mix of real odd-balls including a few guys who worked as drag queens on the<br/>
weekends to fund their way through college (hated those guys - it was not<br/>
fair for them to look more like a woman that I did LOL!)  Anyway, many of<br/>
them were more than casual drug users.  So one night at one of the members&#39;<br/>
apartments someone brought out some pot.  I thought, &quot;Heck, why not?&quot; and<br/>
tried it.  HATED the way I felt the next morning.  But a few weeks later I<br/>
used it again.  Again I HATED the way I felt the next morning.  Took me<br/>
about 4 tries to really listen to my body and allow myself to say, &quot;I<br/>
dislike the way that I feel the next morning more than I like the way I feel<br/>
the night of.&quot;  Fortunately, I internalized all this or I probably would<br/>
have been a drug addict had I shared this with friends.  &quot;Ah, but if you are<br/>
high all the time, then you don&#39;t have to worry about being down.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think food is the same way.  We have to truly experience discomfort and<br/>
make a decision about whether we want to feel that badly again. Your son<br/>
will be able to do that if he is given the opportunity to work it out<br/>
himself and if he sees you working through it as well.  I think most people<br/>
in today&#39;s society have an unheatlhy relationship with food.<br/>

&gt; said before but.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, in formal grammar, BUT not in my real life.  Something can <br/>
happen but something else can happen too.  I had to sit here and <br/>
think about the usage of this word for about 15 minutes before I <br/>
could reply.  I have finally determined that I&#39;m using the <br/>
word &#39;but&#39; in a slang manner I guess.  To you, I used the word <br/>
incorrectly.  I apologize for my bad grammar.  I wonder if a <br/>
traditional schooler would find that a good argument for making sure <br/>
children learn proper grammar and why unschooling wouldn&#39;t work well <br/>
in the &quot;real world&quot;.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I never realized just how many definitions the word &#39;but&#39; has.  I <br/>
googled for it and found this:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/but">http://www.thefreedictionary.com/but</a><br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s very interesting!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Ah, but you have two things going on here.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do see your point because you explained it so clearly, however <br/>
(notice I didn&#39;t use but) I absolutely wouldn&#39;t have considered that <br/>
in my mind.  I see the two things as very related.  It&#39;s <br/>
consequences of behavior.  I see it like this:  My son just caused <br/>
another child bodily harm which is definitely not okay with me.  In <br/>
an effort to help the situation, my first reaction is an <br/>
overreaction and I try to take the toy away.  My son gets hit with <br/>
the toy so now we have 2 children hurt and I&#39;m feeling guilty <br/>
because I handled the situation wrong.  I immediately hold my son, <br/>
give him a hug and apologize for him being hurt when I tried to take <br/>
the toy away.  [Here is where I would comfort my child and wait for <br/>
his tears to go away so he can be in functioning mode.]  Also, I let <br/>
him know that when he grabbed the toy away from the other child and <br/>
pushed him down, that little boy got hurt too.  When we overreact, <br/>
bad consequences can happen.  See?  Mom overreacted and you got hurt <br/>
on accident.  You overreacted and the other child got hurt.  He had <br/>
the toy first and it&#39;s only proper to give it back to him and it&#39;s <br/>
also important to make sure he is okay because hurting someone and <br/>
not showing empathy is not okay.  I&#39;m not suggesting one <br/>
child &#39;mother&#39; the other, but a direct look and an apology is just a <br/>
good thing as I modeled when I apologized for grabbing the toy and <br/>
it hitting my son.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also talks like you had following the &quot;but&quot; of your apology are<br/>
&gt; something that should be done one on one later when he is calm,<br/>
&gt; not emotionally charged and you can do with his attention not<br/>
&gt; being on his bonked head.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh my.  *lol*  I never meant to imply to kick him when he&#39;s down.  <br/>
When I responded to the original poster, I was simply providing some <br/>
example words because she asked specifically, to quote her, &quot;...<br/>
(what kind of words do you use)?&quot;  I suppose I&#39;m in error here <br/>
because I wasn&#39;t blatantly clear to wait until the child is no <br/>
longer crying before talking the issue over with him. [I&#39;m going to <br/>
edit the paragraph above now that I feel I need to add in a pause <br/>
here.]  It didn&#39;t even cross my mind that I would need to mention <br/>
that.  I guess I just felt like all moms would feel the same way.  <br/>
See how easy it is to assume?  In that situation, I would have first <br/>
held my child while also making sure the other child was okay, and <br/>
after the tears stopped I would have talked.  But I wouldn&#39;t wait <br/>
until much later like at home because by then the situation may have <br/>
been totally forgotten and the explanation meaningless.  Or maybe <br/>
that&#39;s just my children.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Responding by directly quoting me is singling me out.  Another way <br/>
to approach it would have been to reply directly to the original <br/>
poster&#39;s note.  We all have our own baggage.  I was responding from <br/>
the mother of a child who has been hurt by someone else who didn&#39;t <br/>
care that my child was hurt in the process.  It left him feeling <br/>
like he was a stupid, bad person (his actual words) because the boy <br/>
had been mean and then the mother took him away from my son.  I also <br/>
totally understand that very young children have short attention <br/>
spans.  However, not ALL 2 year old children lack the ability to <br/>
understand deeper communication.  For all we know, the original <br/>
poster has a child much like my children.  Yes, obviously a <br/>
discussion with a 2 year old would be different from a discussion <br/>
with a 14 year old.  I didn&#39;t mean to imply that.  What I was trying <br/>
to say was that each of my children, ages 8, 9 and 14, could be <br/>
considered too young for any discussion because they might not <br/>
understand.  I know parents who feel that way.  I, however, do not <br/>
feel that way.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m truly sorry I even entered into the conversation.  My kids were <br/>
talking in complete sentences and carrying on full conversations at <br/>
the age of 2 which some adults did find creepy and I totally forgot <br/>
about that until I read the responses to my note.  <br/>

  I don&#39;t find it creepy at all, but I think it&#39;s important to realize <br/>
that some children who are speaking very early may not necessarily <br/>
understand all that&#39;s said to them---they hear what you *say*, but <br/>
don&#39;t always understand what you *mean*.<br/>
<br/>
  At the same time, children who are very late to speak may deeply <br/>
understand almost everything you say to them even though they never say <br/>
a word in return.<br/>
<br/>
 And then there&#39;s everything in between! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

matter how hard we try, we can&#39;t deliberately forget something we have <br/>
learned, and that is catastrophic if we learn that we can&#39;t learn.&quot; <br/>

BUT ;-) in this instance, you can&#39;t effectively do both. If you say  <br/>
&quot;You were wrong&quot; after saying &quot;I was wrong&quot; he&#39;s not going to hear  <br/>
either one because you&#39;re effectively saying you were justified in  <br/>
taking the toy. You may have said you were wrong but the &quot;but&quot; says  <br/>
it was okay because he was even more wrong. At that point he&#39;ll shut  <br/>
down listening because he&#39;s focusing on how wronged he is and that  <br/>
part isn&#39;t being set right.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s still figuring out social skills. He needs *help* in figuring  <br/>
out better choices far more than he needs his faults pointed out.<br/>
<br/>
But what he does fully grasp is that it&#39;s wrong for you to grab a toy  <br/>
from him. And he&#39;ll understand (in his own way) an apology.<br/>
<br/>
What you&#39;re modeling for him with &quot;I was wrong but you were wrong  <br/>
too&quot; in effect is that it&#39;s okay for him to say:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m sorry I kicked you but you didn&#39;t get my milk fast enough.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m sorry I lied, but I knew you wouldn&#39;t let me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m sorry I got that girl pregnant, but opportunity and hormones  <br/>
overcame me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m was wrong, but I was justified in doing it anyway.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s going to make the same mistake again grabbing a toy. (And if he  <br/>
doesn&#39;t, then he didn&#39;t need his mistake pointed out!) You can use  <br/>
future incidents to *help him find a better way to react*. That  <br/>
instance should have been for apologizing for what you did wrong.<br/>

Ah, but you have two things going on here.  You have your apology which<br/>
truly is separate from the incident that began with how you came to hit your<br/>
son with a toy.  To him (and to me) they *are* two separate incidents.  He<br/>
grabbed a toy from another child (first incident)  You grabbed the toy from<br/>
him and hit him in the head (second incident)  You apologized for the second<br/>
incident, but linked it to the first one by talking about it.  Therefore in<br/>
his little mind he thinks that he got hit by the toy because he took the toy<br/>
from another child.<br/>
<br/>
~~~~~something along the lines from the adult saying &quot;Honey I&#39;m sorry I<br/>
grabbed the toy from you like that.  Next time I will help you w/ respect<br/>
for your feelings.&quot;  or maybe &quot;.....Next time we will try to work things out<br/>
differently with the toys.&quot;<br/>
I agree that the explanation should be short enough so a child of two<br/>
doesn&#39;t tune out a long explanation, but just &quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot; w/o any follow up<br/>
statement doesn&#39;t seem to wholly connect the sequence that led up to the<br/>
events.<br/>
What do you you all think?  Would the statement above validate that the<br/>
adult was wrong w/o trying to justify those actions or lay blame on the<br/>
child?<br/>
I ask because I am guilty of reacting the exact same way in those<br/>
situations.<br/>
It really is a knee jerk reaction on my part that I would like to examine.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

&gt;events.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is what *I* would like to hear if *I* had an apology coming to <br/>
me (and not one word more!):<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m so sorry to have hurt you; I made a mistake and I was wrong.  Is <br/>
there anything I can do to make amends?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If there had to be other words, I would want the words to show <br/>
empathy for my &quot;loss&quot; (i.e., &quot;that must have been frightening to you <br/>
when I did that&quot; or &quot;it must have been confusing when I told you it <br/>
was wrong to do that and then did it myself!&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my thinking on the subject, and it may sound a tad harsh, but <br/>
here it is:  The moment I lost it and made a grab for the toy myself, <br/>
I temporarily gave up the moral authority to tell my son what he <br/>
should morally do!  Now, I have to demonstrate to him (or anybody I <br/>
had wronged) what &quot;making amends&quot; really means!  It doesn&#39;t just mean <br/>
saying sorry; it&#39;s putting your money where your mouth is and proving <br/>
you&#39;re sorry.  According to the Onelook quick definition, it <br/>
means:  &quot;something done or paid in expiation of a wrong&quot; or &quot;a sum of <br/>
money paid in compensation for loss or injury.&quot;  I think that&#39;s <br/>
important to note, especially since this thread&#39;s title contains that word!<br/>
<br/>
So, if I have bullied my kid, which comes~~unfortunately~~naturally <br/>
to us parent-folks who are probably having to feel our way through an <br/>
entirely different model of parenting than we saw, I really have to <br/>
do the right thing now.  I have to create a new model for myself (and <br/>
my kid) and do a different thing than the knee-jerk reaction would have me do.<br/>
<br/>
Truth is, I do come a little unhinged sometimes and say things or act <br/>
in a way that I recognize to be more like my folks than the way I <br/>
want to be.  I&#39;m not too hard on myself &#39;cause I can understand why I <br/>
do it, and I forgive myself.  But, that does not mean I shouldn&#39;t <br/>
accept full responsibility for my words and actions.  I *always* <br/>
sincerely apologize to my son when these little events happen and <br/>
offer to make amends (which is whatever *he* decides, not me).  At <br/>
the very least, I make sure I demonstrate empathy for him!  I do not <br/>
get all didactic and wordy (like I&#39;m being right now!) and use them <br/>
as &quot;teaching moments,&quot; though.  (Truthfully, *every moment* is a <br/>
*learning* moment; had I *not* apologized, my son would have come <br/>
away from the experience having learned something that may not be so <br/>
desirable, like &quot;Mom is just a big ole bully who says one thing and <br/>
does another!&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
I believe that it really isn&#39;t about not making mistakes.  It&#39;s <br/>
entirely about how we handle our mistakes when we inevitably make <br/>
them.  Actually, if they don&#39;t kill me, I tend to learn from my <br/>
mistakes, so I don&#39;t mind &#39;em too much (of course, the smaller, the <br/>
better!).  But, I think making mistakes is one of those things we (as <br/>
learning machines) need to do, and for my part I want to make them as <br/>
gracefully as I can, if I can.  I also see myself as more of a model <br/>
for my son than a teacher, and it&#39;s not what I *say* but what I *do* <br/>
that really matters.<br/>
<br/>
Well, there&#39;s my $2 worth (inflation, you know).  Aren&#39;t you sorry <br/>
you asked?  ;-)<br/>

  He says he doesnt really like the way he feels, (although i&#39;m not sure <br/>
how<br/>
  much i have influenced this opinion), and has said he wont eat sweets <br/>
after<br/>
  6 as they stop him from feeling tired. Today he wanted sweets after 6, <br/>
I<br/>
  reminded him of his decision and left it at that.......he had the <br/>
sweets.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m just wondering how I should react when he starts behaving <br/>
differently.<br/>
  SHould I mention the sweets? SHould I keep reminding him of his <br/>
decision,<br/>
  (not sure if he made this to please me). I really dont like sweets and <br/>
so<br/>
 dont want to particularly eat them with him, is that ok?<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  It *could* very well be the additives and not the sugar, but either <br/>
way:<br/>
<br/>
  If he IS noticing that he feels yucky after eating something, that&#39;s <br/>
good!<br/>
<br/>
  Learning what makes us feel bad, good, and better is the first step to <br/>
knowing what&#39;s best for us as individuals.<br/>
<br/>
 I&#39;ll insert the pot thang here! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Cameron was smoking marijuana. I guess I could have reacted like all <br/>
the mainstream parents I know and forbade it. Could have. Instead we <br/>
talked about it. I gave my reasons why not. He did his own research <br/>
personally and online. He had some good reasons why it wasn&#39;t harmful. <br/>
My two main reasons against were that it was illegal (and if caught, it <br/>
could mean fines/prosecution/prison time not to mention it could <br/>
jeopardize our unschooling) and it could hinder driving abilities. The <br/>
compromise was that he wouldn&#39;t smoke and drive (I would pick him up if <br/>
he called, which I did several times).<br/>
<br/>
  The other day he told me it made him feel bad the next day. Really <br/>
bad. I&#39;ve never smoked, so I guess he meant hungover-bad. I don&#39;t think <br/>
that will stop him from taking a toke every now and then, but I know he <br/>
won&#39;t be in a Ridgemont High Fog all the time! &lt;G&gt; Essentially, he&#39;s <br/>
quit. The bad feeling outweighs the initial good feeling. *His* choice.<br/>
<br/>
  Keeping our kids from things *we* perceive as dangerous or bad for us <br/>
doesn&#39;t have the same power as things *they* decide aren&#39;t good for <br/>
them. They&#39;re rational, smart human beings who need to feel their way <br/>
about in the world. They *want* to feel happy and healthy and strong.<br/>
<br/>
  If a child decides that a diet high in sugar makes him feel yucky, <br/>
he&#39;ll probably eat less sugar. He will probably *still* eat sugar---but <br/>
only when *he* decides the benefits outweigh the consequences.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;d probably gently remind him how he felt the last time he ate too <br/>
much. But accept that he might not care this time. Each time will make <br/>
it easier and easier for him to make his own decisions. It&#39;s not <br/>
life-threatening, right?<br/>

<br/>
I joined this list preety recently and so i&#39;m not sure if there have always <br/>
been posts about the way replies are written and the offence that some <br/>
people take.<br/>
<br/>
Once again I want to reiterate that I&#39;ve found this group immensely helpful <br/>
in my learning curve.  I bought &#39;the unschooling handbook&#39; months ago and <br/>
when I received it I read it and hated it........i didnt think i&#39;d ever &#39;get <br/>
to that place&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Today I found the book buried amongst my ds&#39; Simpsons magazines and have <br/>
flicked through it---now I &#39;get it&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m happy right now and wanted to share that, because i&#39;ve come a long way <br/>
with the help of reading posts on this list.  We are getting to be soo cool <br/>
in our house its great!!<br/>

<br/>
Do you have friends who could come pick her up and take her swimming, or <br/>
horseback riding, or skating, or to the park?<br/>
Do you have friends over who are fun and lively?<br/>
Do you get invited to dinner with friends or to parties?<br/>
Do you have a yard where you could put up a tetherball or basketball hoop?<br/>
Do you belong to a church that has a youth group with organized activities <br/>
she can participate in?<br/>
Can you take her to the pool even if you don&#39;t feel like swimming?<br/>
Could she play basketball at the Y?<br/>
Do you have a car?<br/>
Do you live near a bus line?<br/>
Would your disability allow you to take in laundry or ironing from your <br/>
neighbors for a little extra money for the bus maybe?<br/>
Could you take her and a friend out to parks and fun places so that even if <br/>
you couldn&#39;t play she&#39;d have a companion?<br/>
Does she have a bike?<br/>
Are you able to walk to near-by interesting places, Chinese food markets, <br/>
herb shops, gift stores, junk stores?<br/>
Are you close to or can you get to a library?<br/>
What kinds of things does your daughter like to do?<br/>
What do you do at home for fun?   Do you play board games?  Does she like <br/>
the computer?  Does she have favorite kinds of movies and music?<br/>
Does she like to cook, sew, sculpt, draw, dance?<br/>
Does she like to read?<br/>
Do you read together?<br/>
<br/>
Your situation does sound stressful.   Have you considered that you might be <br/>
depressed?<br/>
As difficult as it is, your disabilities don&#39;t abdicate you from the <br/>
responsibility of giving your daughter an interesting life.  Was she opposed <br/>
to school, did she hate it?   I ask because if you can&#39;t provide her with a <br/>
way out of the house and activities maybe it would be better for her to go <br/>
to school.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling only works well when we can offer up a more interesting world <br/>
than the schools can.   While that&#39;s not hard to do it does require a lot of <br/>
time and energy on the parents part.   If her life at home is dull or <br/>
stressful and there&#39;s no way to go do interesting things, and you don&#39;t have <br/>
a time frame for when that might change, then I really don&#39;t know how this <br/>
could be good for her.<br/>
<br/>
But maybe we didn&#39;t get a really accurate idea about her life from your <br/>
post, so I&#39;m asking those questions because I think you&#39;ll get more ideas <br/>
here if people know what she likes to do and what you are able to help her <br/>
do.<br/>

lose the weight. ***<br/>
<br/>
Stop focusing on her weight and focus on her health.   Help her mental <br/>
health, by getting out of the house and being with friends and doing <br/>
interesting things,  Liven up your home life.  Borrow some new or different <br/>
music from the library.   Show her some of the dances that were popular when <br/>
you were her age.  Borrow dance videos and try some of the steps,  Check out <br/>
musicals and sing!  See if some friends can lend you some games you haven&#39;t <br/>
played before.  Find some puzzles at the second hand store.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t think of physical activity as exercise for her weight, think of it as <br/>
nourishment for her emotional state.  People need to move in order to feel <br/>
really good.  You need to find ways for her to be active, not to make her <br/>
lose weight but because being sedentary contributes to depression and moving <br/>
helps alleviate stress.<br/>
<br/>
Help her physical health by *adding* protein foods and other nutritious <br/>
foods and maybe a vitamin supplement to your diet rather than pressing her <br/>
to limit foods.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1788220318">Another question!<br/>
<br/>
I know many of you experienced people started radical unschooling before your children were even born (I mean those ideas were part of your ideological makeup before you had kids)but for those who have come to these ideas later, did you find a logical progression of ideas or did you arrive at radical unschooling all of a heap?<br/>
<br/>
We started looking at unschooling when my son said he didn&#39;t have time for school. This was startling to me as I had cheerfully assumed that he somehow needed me to fill his day for him (yes, I&#39;m sorry, I know....)Then we started relaxing a lot. I required maths, but that was all, he and I lived our days together. he makes stop motion movies, and i make bags to sell at the local market, and all goes well.<br/>
<br/>
Then he has asked me to stop the maths, so, with worry, I did. Then he asked me to teach him percentages. &quot;I know how to find 10% of something, but what if I wanted to know, say 8% of 4672?&quot; I asked him why he wanted to know, and he said he just did. So we are doing percentages right now (Key to Percentages). <br/>
<br/>
Now I am wondering if the next step is radical unschooling, have people found this follows logically on from unschooling? Already i can see that my son knows quite well how to live his own life, his own way, yet somehow I find it so hard to let go of my notions that somehow it is &#39;good&#39; for kids to do chores etc. <br/>

<br/>
I came to unschooling later in Ray&#39;s life but early in Mo&#39;s. There certainly was a logical progression, but in my case it was a progression of my ideas about adult relationships and learning and slowly coming to see that they could apply to relationships between parents and children. <br/>

<br/>
Some kids find those kinds of puzzles fascinating (some adults, too)! Mo&#39;s currently fascinated with multiplication, squares and square roots, and really big numbers. She&#39;s also interested in dinosaurs and space right now, so she has lots of chances to play with really big numbers in those contexts - billions of miles and billions of years, what&#39;s the next biggest after billions, mom? Er... let me tell you about scientific notation...<br/>
<br/>
Ray, otoh, is more practical in his interest in mathematics. He wants to know how to figure sales tax when he sells his wood and metal work, how to figure fractions of inches for some of his designs, that sort of thing. He wants real world math, the kind that revolves around tools and doing things, not math as a fantastic puzzle. In a way, that&#39;s a whole different kind of mathematics because its dependent on the tools themselves. Technical trades, and the maths they employ, tend to revolve around those tools.  <br/>

I&#39;d have to say that, for me personally, that both ideas of unschooling &quot;academics&quot; and unschooling &quot;life&quot; grew in ways that swirled together and overlapped. Some parts made sense before other parts - like I could trust my kids to learn but not always myself to be their partner without interfering. In a sense, until I really internalized the idea of living a life based on my own principles I didn&#39;t trust myself to be a good model (and therefore I &quot;had to&quot; teach). I think that&#39;s were a lot of the idea of &quot;teaching&quot; kids life lessons comes from. You know the saying: do as I say, not as I do. And I bet you know how well that works, too ;)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Already i can see that my son knows quite well how to live his own life, his own way, yet somehow I find it so hard to let go of my notions that somehow it is &#39;good&#39; for kids to do chores etc.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*******************<br/>
<br/>
In what way(s) is it good? Really think about that. Make a list if it helps. Break it down into bits, too. If &quot;responsibility&quot; is on that list, think about what you mean by the word - what is &quot;responsibility&quot; made of? Pulling things apart and getting to the heart of what I meant by my own ideas helped me to see where my thinking was very muddy. I realized I had a whole lot of stuff in my head that was there because I&#39;d heard certain truisms over and over and just assumed they were true! But when I started digging down into what I really thought and meant and knew to be true (in the sense of real causes-and-effects) it was easier to see where those truisms were fallacies - things &quot;everyone knows&quot; because &quot;everyone&quot; says them and Nothing else.<br/>
<br/>
Thinking about my own principles, I&#39;ve moved away from overarching ideas like responsibility and even respect and freedom. Instead, I think about kindness and generosity, about joyfulness and warmth and bringing more of those into my life. Demanding another person do something (for me, for the group, for the sake of some higher ideal) doesn&#39;t add any of those things to my life, or that other person&#39;s life. My kids aren&#39;t happier for my demands. But when I give generously to my kids, they do nice things for me. The 16yo does nice, houseworky things. The 8yo makes me nice presents. They give kindness and warmth back to me. They smile and my house is full of joy. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1030564793">Even for us, who started early (from birth), going from the<br/>
&#39;educational&#39; unschooling model to expanding it to all of life was a<br/>
progression. Things like bedtimes, punishment (time out, removing toys,<br/>
etc), hygiene, etc still had a learning curve to them for us. But, since<br/>
we trusted that DS would learn and we never limited his food or media<br/>
(trusted him to know when he was hungry, when he&#39;d had enough Big, Comfy<br/>
Couch, etc) everything else is called into question. We&#39;d chew on ideas,<br/>
play &#39;devil&#39;s advocate&#39; scenarios between us, etc. We got most of it<br/>
&#39;figured out&#39; by the time that DS was about 5 (so it took us 5 years).<br/>
But, there&#39;s always something new, some new developmental change, etc.<br/>
that pops up - for instance, right now DS is heading into puberty (he&#39;s<br/>
11) so that&#39;s all new territory for us. The framework is there already<br/>
(trust, discussion, openness, etc) but how it applies to new<br/>
situations/circumstances still takes time and work. It&#39;s a relationship<br/>
and all relationships require work to keep them healthy and whole.<br/>
