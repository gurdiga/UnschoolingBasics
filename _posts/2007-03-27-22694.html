<div id="ygrps-yiv-846460095">Hi all--<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re new homeschoolers and now trying to learn about unschooling as <br/>
we seem to be being pulled strongly in that direction. I&#39;ve been <br/>
doing lots of reading here, websites and books. So, while I feel <br/>
that I am starting to &quot;get&quot; this in my head, I still feel like I <br/>
have a long way to go to get it in terms of what it looks like in <br/>
actual practice in certain situations. <br/>
<br/>
One of the issues I have been pondering in general and now <br/>
specifically in relation to unschooling is how to approach money <br/>
with kids. We&#39;ve been giving our kids allowances (ages 4 and 7) b/c <br/>
we want them to have $$ that belongs to them that we don&#39;t have any <br/>
say over how they spend. But then I find I have a hard time keeping <br/>
mouth shut when they spend 79 cents on what I am pretty sure will <br/>
become another piece of flotsam in our house!<br/>
<br/>
This has been compounded by my and my husband&#39;s recent decision to <br/>
try not to buy anything new for a year. We have not imposed this on <br/>
the kids though we are really trying to focus more on &quot;collecting <br/>
experiences instead of stuff&quot; and the help them take this in.<br/>
<br/>
So . . . I&#39;m unsure about allowances (they&#39;re not tied to chsores <br/>
though we do give them ways to earn extra $$) and deciding on how to <br/>
share the family money, how to make consistent decisions about when <br/>
we&#39;ll give more $$ to buy something they want but don&#39;t have the $$ <br/>
for. I guess the rub I see is that for things that or more expensive <br/>
and that we choose to buy, we are controlling them in saying what <br/>
we&#39;ll buy or what we want. <br/>
<br/>
Am I making any sense? So I&#39;d really appreciate some feedback on how <br/>
others approach and think about this. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve just read Ren&#39;s book, Alfie Kohn&#39;s Punished by Rewards and am <br/>
going for my 2nd read of Unconditional Parenting! So, I&#39;m on the <br/>
road here but really need some guides!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

From: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:chris1962@...">chris1962@...</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One of the issues I have been pondering in general and now<br/>
specifically in relation to unschooling is how to approach money<br/>
with kids. We&#39;ve been giving our kids allowances (ages 4 and 7) b/c<br/>
we want them to have $$ that belongs to them that we don&#39;t have any<br/>
say over how they spend. But then I find I have a hard time keeping<br/>
mouth shut when they spend 79 cents on what I am pretty sure will<br/>
become another piece of flotsam in our house!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think one of the biggest problems with allowances (and we were guilty <br/>
of this too) is that the parents give the children a pittance and then <br/>
expect them to make good decisions with that tiny amount of $$.<br/>
<br/>
Different when I was a kid. I got a quarter a week. But the things I <br/>
wanted when I was that age really didn&#39;t cost much: I could save up <br/>
pretty quickly. I mean---for example: I was getting a DIME an hour for <br/>
baby-sitting at 13. When I went up to a quarter an hour, you&#39;d thunk <br/>
the world was coming to an end! &lt;bwg&gt; Things were CHEAP! That&#39;s my teen <br/>
years, but as a child a quarter was a good it of money. You could get <br/>
two candy bars. A &quot;big&quot; toy was only 4-5 dollars---so saving up didn&#39;t <br/>
take long---especially when you could find half of the cost between the <br/>
sofa cushions or on the street!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway---things cost more now, plus the techno things are so big. <br/>
Duncan wants a game that costs $65---no matter how hard we look, <br/>
there&#39;ll never be nearly that in the sofa cushions!<br/>
<br/>
So IF you&#39;re going to give an allowance, make sure it&#39;s enough to get <br/>
them what they&#39;ll want---not necessarily all at once, but what they can <br/>
reasonably save.<br/>
<br/>
We started out giving like $2/week or something like that. The boys <br/>
would spend it on two candy bars. The DAY they got it. But if you  <br/>
think about it, it kind of makes sense. If they were to try to save, <br/>
we&#39;re talking about 6-7 MONTHS to save for a game---IF they don&#39;t spend <br/>
*any* and IF they&#39;re interested in *that* game still and IF it&#39;s still <br/>
around and IF....so it&#39;s not unreasonable to think that it would  make <br/>
more sense to just go ahead and spend it on something small NOW.<br/>
<br/>
So Ben & I talked about upping it *considerably* as all the unschoolers <br/>
suggested. So Duncan suddenly got $50/month (I think...Cameron got <br/>
more.) instead of $2/week. That was SOOOO doable for him! He could <br/>
spend a little but save a LOT towards a new game. He could buy 2-3 used <br/>
games. He could actually *make decisions* about his money. AND buy a <br/>
candy bar! &lt;G&gt; But it was the decision-making that was important!<br/>
<br/>
It has made ALL the difference in how he handles money. Of course, it <br/>
didn&#39;t happen overnight! At first he spent every penny, but it very <br/>
quickly changed to understanding how he could manipulate the funds.<br/>
<br/>
So if you&#39;re going to do the allowance thang, make it worth their while.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
This has been compounded by my and my husband&#39;s recent decision to<br/>
try not to buy anything new for a year. We have not imposed this on<br/>
the kids though we are really trying to focus more on &quot;collecting<br/>
experiences instead of stuff&quot; and the help them take this in.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=--=<br/>
<br/>
Can you make this &quot;no buying new&quot; experiment have a definite &quot;end date&quot; <br/>
so that they children will know when it&#39;s over? Maybe a small party to <br/>
show &quot;we did it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ben and I talked about it when it made some news a few months back. <br/>
People doing it for &quot;fun&quot; and to see how it felt. We did it for YEARS <br/>
because we HAD to. I don&#39;t feel that need anymore. &lt;g&gt; Honorable, but <br/>
we&#39;ve &quot;been there.&quot; In fact, other than mattresses, I don&#39;t know of one <br/>
piece of furniture we&#39;ve ever bought new. Looking around---I can&#39;t see <br/>
one! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Still, there are many kids&#39; games available used too! Dunc&#39;s PS2 was <br/>
used. GREAT deal! Still expensive, and at $2/week, he could never have <br/>
bought it. *I* bought it for him, but it was so much more affordable <br/>
than brand new---and it works great. He&#39;s saving for a Wii now. It <br/>
would be obsolete by the time he saved enough $2/weeks!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
So . . . I&#39;m unsure about allowances (they&#39;re not tied to chsores<br/>
though we do give them ways to earn extra $$) and deciding on how to<br/>
share the family money, how to make consistent decisions about when<br/>
we&#39;ll give more $$ to buy something they want but don&#39;t have the $$<br/>
for. I guess the rub I see is that for things that or more expensive<br/>
and that we choose to buy, we are controlling them in saying what<br/>
we&#39;ll buy or what we want.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
Are they allowed a say when you waste $4 on a cup of designer coffee? <br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That one always cracks me up. Kids can&#39;t buy a $3 toy, but mom can turn <br/>
right around and buy a $4 cup o&#39; Joe.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve just read Ren&#39;s book, Alfie Kohn&#39;s Punished by Rewards and am<br/>
going for my 2nd read of Unconditional Parenting! So, I&#39;m on the<br/>
road here but really need some guides!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
RUE&#39;s book, but that&#39;s OK---they get mixed up all the time. They even <br/>
share a birthday! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
After meeting them both, you wouldn&#39;t mistake them again---promise! <br/>
&lt;bwg&gt; Ren&#39;s the LOUD one. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1118471445">Kelly,<br/>
again I appreciate how you word things. I wanted to emphasize two of<br/>
the items in your email.<br/>
First is the size of allowance, you are SO right. People get so stuck<br/>
on dollar amounts, and rarely consider the needs or interests of the<br/>
child.  The best suggestion I ever read was to look at how much stuff<br/>
costs in your area (because as I&#39;ve noticed during our travels, even<br/>
the cost of a candy bar varies GREATLY from area to area!) This guy<br/>
suggested looking at how much some junk food, a few drinks, and some<br/>
little toys costs. Then add a few dollars to save, amount depending on<br/>
your own budget.<br/>
The second you mentioned about limiting the time frame. We are trying<br/>
to get out of debt, and really needed to focus on saving cash for our<br/>
trip. Most of the kids were okay with not buying toys or a lot of junk<br/>
food (in fact, Emily has been very adamant every time we are<br/>
shopping), but Josh was very stressed out about it, especially as we<br/>
approach the release dates of several Wii games. However, when I<br/>
suggested that we try it for five months (until the conference date)<br/>
and reassess, he was more than willing to forgo allowance. Two years<br/>
ago I don&#39;t think he could have agreed to no allowance. <br/>
For what it&#39;s worth, Josh was getting about $5 a week, the girls were<br/>
up to $3. After our time frame, we&#39;ll be reassessing though, and I<br/>
imagine they&#39;ll be getting more (partly because our debt will be<br/>
better under control)<br/>
