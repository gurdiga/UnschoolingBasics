<div id="ygrps-yiv-1759162026">This isn&#39;t on the topic of unschooling--or even homeschooling, but I <br/>
hope you will forgive me!  I just wanted to get this out to as many <br/>
people as possible--it is a really great concept.  Understand that <br/>
my intent here is only to pass along some information that may <br/>
someday help one of us if the unfortunate need ever occurs.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how many of you have heard of &quot;ICE&quot;  but <br/>
apparently, there was a paramedic who started this concept.  Often, <br/>
at the scene of an accident or emergency, emergency personnel in <br/>
looking for whom to contactoften use the patient&#39;s cell phone.  <br/>
This particular paramedic noted how everyone has a cell phone, BUT <br/>
we all have so many numbers in it that it was difficult for the <br/>
emergency personnel to figure out just who to contact.  So he came <br/>
up with the idea of  &quot;ICE&quot;  (In Case of Emergency).  The idea is <br/>
that you program into your phone the number (or numbers) of who <br/>
should be contacted In Case of Emergency and then label that number  <br/>
in your phone as ICE.  If you have more than one number, you just <br/>
program them in as ICE1, ICE2, ICE3, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
This has been gaining quite a bit of popularityand helping <br/>
emergency personnel (and patients/victims who are unable to speak) <br/>
in the process.   <br/>
<br/>
I thought it was a pretty good idea (from a safety standpoint)and <br/>
wanted to pass it along to all of you!  I have already &quot;ICE&quot;d my <br/>
phone!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2021073458">Thank you for this information.  I hope you don&#39;t<br/>
mind, but I passed this on to some of my friends and<br/>
family.  I plan on ICE-ing my cell phone right now.<br/>
