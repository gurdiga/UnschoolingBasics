<div id="ygrps-yiv-892818562">Hi Everyone,<br/>
   <br/>
  I am a lurker .... let me introduce myself briefly. My name is Nia & I have a 5 yr old son (6 in August), and another little boy on the way in Oct. We have always unschooled - Nishay (son) has never attended school or daycare (except 3 unfortunate weeks a long time ago).  <br/>
   <br/>
  My husband is in the middle of looking for another job & plans to take a month off between jobs - maybe sometime before the baby is born. We were planning that he & Nishay take a few days/week father-son trip sometime then - possibly camping or doing something else (?ideas) - and we thought it would be extra nice if they could hook up with other unschooling dads for the chosen activity. Is there anyway to find out if there is something going on then? Where would I look, who would I ask/write to? any other ideas?<br/>
   <br/>
  Thanks in advance! and thanks for this wonderful list!<br/>
  Nia<br/>

  The Live and Learn Unschooling Conference in Albuquerque, MN September <br/>
6-10 might be an idea---LOTS of unschooling dads and kids all weekend. <br/>
Exotic place, cool museums, and neat stuff to do.<br/>

  &quot;The hardest problem for the brain is not learning, but forgetting. No <br/>
matter how hard we try, we can&#39;t deliberately forget something we have <br/>
learned, and that is catastrophic if we learn that we can&#39;t learn.&quot; <br/>
