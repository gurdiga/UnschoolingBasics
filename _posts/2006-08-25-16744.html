Don&#39;t take it personally, we have no control over yahoo problems. If<br/>
there was a problem with your post, you would know about it from us.<br/>
When we hit &quot;reject&quot;, you get an explanation along with it.<br/>
<br/>
I just checked the moderator activity and nothing has been rejected<br/>
since the 10th. That rejection was a spam post by some annoying,<br/>
random person. It isn&#39;t happening on our end. Sorry you&#39;re having<br/>
problems.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1676066598">And just to add to Ren, I sent a post a couple of weeks back and did my best to keep up with responses and never saw one.  I looked through the messages and it never posted although other messages that I sent that same day posted.  I have had that happen with at least one other group in the last 2 weeks.<br/>
<br/>
Peace to you<br/>

Well, to add to the mystery: sometimes I get approved posts in my box <br/>
an hour or two before I even get them on moderation to be asked whether <br/>
I want to approve them! &lt;g&gt; Truly weird.<br/>

<br/>
That just means another mod approved it already, that&#39;s all!!:)<br/>
It takes Yahoo a while to send an email asking for posts to be<br/>
moderated, they show up at the group right away though. I don&#39;t check<br/>
the group via email, I use the actual site. So I&#39;ve often approved<br/>
messages right after they hit the list, before yahoo sends an email<br/>
asking for approval.<br/>
<br/>
When the group is &quot;temporarily unavailable&quot;, posts can still come<br/>
through. The disappearing posts seems to be a unique yahoo problem<br/>
though....just happened at liveandlearnconference group this week too.<br/>
Argh.<br/>
