<div id="ygrps-yiv-1359152618">&quot;Unschooling is NOT avoiding<br/>
books or structure, some children demand structure. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, BUT (there&#39;s always a caveat, isn&#39;t there?:) if a child has <br/>
only had scool work, and doesn&#39;t see the learning in everything, <br/>
then I think it&#39;s important to help them heal from that and find the <br/>
learning in all of life.<br/>
<br/>
Also, structure does NOT equal schoolwork!! Not by any stretch. So <br/>
many parents get caught up in that trap. Yes, some kids adore <br/>
structure to their days. What this means is helping them plan, <br/>
coming up with their own guideline for the day, so they know what is <br/>
happening. Just because a child likes to have things planned out, <br/>
or &quot;structured&quot;, doesn&#39;t mean they need lessons.<br/>
<br/>
Some children love workbooks. I have a radically unschooled dd that <br/>
loves pulling out &quot;schoolwork&quot;. But it&#39;s done on her own terms, when <br/>
she chooses it and she knows that she can learn from everything in <br/>
life. She doesn&#39;t see it as some superior method of learning, or as <br/>
something she&#39;s missing if it&#39;s not done.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re new to unschooling, I suggest looking at your days as <br/>
summer vacation. Have a vacation for a few months, try to not learn <br/>
ANYTHING and just have fun. If you get to July and haven&#39;t learned <br/>
anything new, please write me because you&#39;ll be the first person to <br/>
ever have that happen.:)<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers understand that true learning is interest driven. Until <br/>
there is a need for information, it&#39;s silly to try and get it into <br/>
one&#39;s head. We trust that our children love to learn and will learn <br/>
the unique things they need for their own life&#39;s journey in their <br/>
own time. <br/>

Ah, Ren, that&#39;s just what I wish I&#39;d had the presence of mind to say to my sister on Monday.  She just started homeschooling her kids, and I was sharing how important I think deschooling is.  She said &#39;yes, but the kids are asking me when they&#39;re going to start learning something.&#39;  I reminded her that life is learning, all the time.  I don&#39;t know why it didn&#39;t occur to me to suggest she announce summer vacation today.<br/>

I agree with this.  My dd now aged 11 had a terrible time adjusting after coming out of school and could only do school type things. It has taken her 4 years to be able to do things in a different way and now she is a very motivated child who learns by lots of means not just workbooks or sheets e.t.c. She hardly looks at workbooks anymore but it was a confidence thing with her.She was worried she would not learn the &quot;right things&quot;. Now she knows there is not right or wrong learning and all learning is learning she has blossomed.  As a by product of letting go of the schooly work she discovered she is a very good artist and spends a lot of time each day drawing and painting.<br/>

school. She went to preschool 2 mornings a week, but<br/>
that wasn&#39;t very schoolish.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, we bought Miquon Math workbooks for her when a<br/>
friend of ours was selling them. We never asked her to<br/>
do any worksheets. She did a few when the books were<br/>
new and then they were put away till 2 days ago. Then<br/>
she pulled them out and did many pages in the<br/>
afternoon and late at night. I mentioned to dh that<br/>
she seems to be treating them the same as she treats a<br/>
new computer game. Then last night she pulled out the<br/>
workbook again and we did a couple pages. Then I<br/>
turned to a page that she didn&#39;t like and she said, &quot;I<br/>
don&#39;t like this game, I want to find another one.&quot; So<br/>
she does really think of them as a game or just<br/>
another interesting activity. I think this is a very<br/>
different attitude from one that a kid who&#39;s been<br/>
schooled and done tons of worksheets would have.<br/>
