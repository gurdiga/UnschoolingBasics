<div id="ygrps-yiv-734684689">I posted awhile back about our upcoming move and the slow internet service we would have at our new house. I was concerned about the impact it would have on my son&#39;s gaming. Well, we&#39;re here now and all of our worries were for nothing! We only get 1.5 mbs and have no problems with online gaming, download speed, etc. Amazing!<br/>
Well, just wanted to give an update. Thanks for the suggestions. <br/>
