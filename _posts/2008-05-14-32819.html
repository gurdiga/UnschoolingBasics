<div id="ygrps-yiv-1748639599">Last year my husband, my son and I moved to a small town.  My son is 8<br/>
1/2 and on the autism spectrum.  Coming from a big city, we were quite<br/>
surprised to find that many kids here wander from house to house,<br/>
unsupervised, playing in the houses or yards of other kids that they<br/>
pick up as they go.  Funny, although I grew up like this, I actually<br/>
found this quite shocking!  On the plus side, our yard has been<br/>
regularly full of kids who often stop in to play with my son for a<br/>
while. The friendships my son has made in the safety of his backyard<br/>
have been the best he&#39;s made to date and he&#39;s very excited about his<br/>
new popularity.  He is feeling a confidence in himself that is brand<br/>
new to him and that he is very proud of.<br/>
<br/>
And yet I knew it had to happen - my son now wants to &quot;roam&quot;  with the<br/>
pack.  Besides me not being okay with this in principle, I also know<br/>
that he still relies heavily on my constant availability to help him<br/>
deal with situations that are out of his comfort zone.  I think he has<br/>
forgotten that he still does this, as he feels like &quot;them&quot; when<br/>
everyone is playing in our yard.  Yet now he says  he wants to try<br/>
&quot;going out on his own&quot; so he can &quot;make his own mistakes&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
I can see he is really growing and starting to feel like he belongs<br/>
for the first time in his life and his enthusiasm is absolutely<br/>
wonderful to see.  Yet only two days ago he told me he was terrorized<br/>
by his friend&#39;s 3 year old little brother that was bullying him<br/>
(pulled his hair), while he was on a playdate at his friend&#39;s house<br/>
and he spent the last half hour there hiding in the back yard until I<br/>
picked him up, while his friend played video games in the house.    <br/>
<br/>
I can talk to him about many things, but he does not want to hear<br/>
anything but &quot;be free&quot; when it comes to the subject of his new<br/>
friends. I suspect he is going to slip out of the yard one of these<br/>
days to test his new confidence in himself... Any suggestions as to<br/>
how I can prevent myself from having a major coronary when I can&#39;t<br/>
find him would be most welcome.  And perhaps a better approach to<br/>
discussing why &quot;roaming&quot; is not appropriate at his age when everyone<br/>
else is apparently doing it and are all fine (besides fear-based ideas).  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2077956841">Well, being in a similar situation with Josh, I&#39;ll share what we did  <br/>
to make both of us happy.<br/>
<br/>
I let him go.<br/>
<br/>
Not just walk out the door, but we spent a lot of time talking about  <br/>
options. We made social stories while talking about what he could do  <br/>
if *this* happened, and what he could do if *that* happened. It&#39;s  <br/>
still very scary for me, because he does have autism, and he often  <br/>
freezes in dangerous situations. He was so terribly bullied in  <br/>
school, too, so that often he accepts verbal and light physical abuse  <br/>
as just part of life. We started off with going three or four houses  <br/>
to each side, as well as the park that is next to our backyard. I  <br/>
could keep a visual on him, and he could see the house and remember  <br/>
his options. And I could see that for the most part he did fine. We  <br/>
would work on one issue at a time (ie &quot;If Friend&#39;s brother pulls your  <br/>
hair, you can yell &quot;stop!&quot; and tell his mom/ leave and come home/ <br/>
whatever.&quot;) I wish that we had done it while he was younger, by age  <br/>
ten/eleven, the kids stopped roaming and just hung out at homes, he  <br/>
wasn&#39;t really part of the group yet, and now he&#39;s just not part of  <br/>
the group at all. He has friends, but not in this neighborhood, so we  <br/>
must drive to visit. And when kids walk by, he doesn&#39;t say hi to  <br/>
them, and they don&#39;t say hi to him. He does have two friends, one  <br/>
that is three blocks away, that he can walk to and visit with, and  <br/>
they come over here. So I&#39;m thankful for them. I just wish for one  <br/>
more year.<br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why would roaming not be appropriate at age 8.5?  I had a few years of free<br/>
range summers as a kid, and I think your son is one of the lucky 1% of kids<br/>
in the US who live where simple freedoms like roaming aren&#39;t legislated,<br/>
regulated, or otherwise frowned upon by the citizenry.<br/>
<br/>
At age 8-11 in the summers (I was always schooled), I&#39;d leave home on my<br/>
bike right after breakfast and spend the day going between several different<br/>
houses, playing baseball on the empty school yard, etc.  I was sometimes 2<br/>
miles from home (farther than that, a few times), but mostly within about<br/>
1/4 mile.  And I say we were between houses, but really we were just on the<br/>
street, on the go, and only sometimes in someone&#39;s house or yard.  There was<br/>
a steak restaurant on the boulevard a few blocks from home that had a<br/>
soft-serve vanilla ice cream dispenser for patrons.  The manager would let<br/>
my bicycle gang (about 6-10 of us, usually, age 8-11 or so) get cones for 10<br/>
cents, and we&#39;d do that a couple times a day.  We&#39;d have contests to see who<br/>
could make their cone tallest without it falling off.  I can still taste<br/>
that ice cream. <br/>
<br/>
We made ramps to jump our bicycles over garbage cans and curbs and whatever<br/>
else we could find.  We&#39;d beg for scrap lumber at a nearby lumber yard to<br/>
build our ramps and clubhouses and treehouses (or steal, a few times, if it<br/>
was Sunday and we needed wood...but one time we told them about it and they<br/>
said it was OK...it was only scraps).  We let Jimmy hang out with us (even<br/>
though he was pretty mean sometimes) only because his dad had subscriptions<br/>
to several nudie magazines and would drop them in the trash where Jimmy<br/>
could grab them.  Jimmy had a stack about a foot tall hidden in his bedroom,<br/>
and we&#39;d take a few to the clubhouse sometimes but Jimmy usually preferred<br/>
they stay indoors.  We had about 4 different clubhouses, one of them in the<br/>
field next to my house.  I&#39;d usually go home for lunch, but not always.  And<br/>
some days I&#39;d be in and out of the house several times, retrieving ball<br/>
gloves or other gear, or getting a band-aid.  But mostly I&#39;d just be gone,<br/>
playing, and get home around dusk.<br/>
<br/>
My free ranging summers are among my fondest memories of childhood.  After<br/>
age 11, we moved around a lot and there was only one other summer when I had<br/>
a bicycle gang to hang with.  It saddens me that my 3 y/o DS isn&#39;t likely to<br/>
have similar experiences...or not as many of them, at least.  With everyone<br/>
worried about injury liability and predators and related adult crap/fears,<br/>
roaming days are mostly history except in the small towns like where you<br/>
live.  Enjoy it!  When I see bicycles in my neighborhood these days, it<br/>
appears to be a family &quot;going for a ride&quot;.  My parents had bicycles, and<br/>
we&#39;d all &quot;go for a ride&quot; as a family sometimes on a Sunday, but that was a<br/>
different thing altogether from the true intended purpose of MY bicycle,<br/>
which was a ticket to Freedom.<br/>
<br/>
I have zero experience/opinion about how autism would factor into<br/>
this...just wanted to reminisce about my own free range years.  <br/>

Get him a cell phone or walkie talkie so that he can call if he&#39;s <br/>
*ever* in an uncomfortable situation.<br/>
<br/>
That way you can each trust that the other is available and respect the <br/>
needs of the other.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1811570690">I can understand your fears.  I don&#39;t know your son or his<br/>
limitations, but it sounds like he is trying to stretch his wings.  It<br/>
is hard as a parent to keep *control* over what is happening as the<br/>
children get older.  Though you are looking out for his best interest,<br/>
you also need to look at the situation from his point of view.  <br/>
<br/>
He is making new friends, accepted into the group, and wanting to play<br/>
like the other kids do.  These are all exciting and fun things.  Being<br/>
the mom who says &quot;No you can&#39;t because...&quot; is going to create<br/>
resentment or frustration on his part.  He may leave the yard to defy<br/>
you and prove you wrong.  Many of the spectrum kids I know will rely<br/>
on fact.  &quot;If I leave the yard, play safely, and return safely, then I<br/>
have proven that she was wrong and I was right.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Given that I don&#39;t know your situation or feelings on the matter, I<br/>
would do one of two things.  One... make my yard so cool that the kids<br/>
ALL want to play at my yard till my son is a bit older.  Two... buy<br/>
him one of those nice watches with a GPS locator on it so you can find<br/>
him if he wanders too far from the group.  Some would think this is<br/>
too invasive, but I think I would consider it as a back-up plan if my<br/>
kid wandered and hadn&#39;t returned by a certain time.  <br/>
<br/>
Unless you wish to have him live with you forever, you have to loosen<br/>
the reigns little bits at a time and teach him the skills that he<br/>
needs to return safely and in a timely manner.  Kids will make<br/>
mistakes, it is our job to allow them the freedom to make the mistakes<br/>
that will teach them and pick them up when they need a hand.  <br/>
<br/>
Wishing you all the best of luck in whatever path you choose. <br/>

<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure, but I *do* know that *most* of my fears are bigger than <br/>
reality. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not really fearful, either, but I am protective. And I know that <br/>
the *probability* is pretty low than anything bad would happen, but <br/>
there *IS* nevertheless a slight possibility.<br/>
<br/>
But I can&#39;t hold them back because of all the things *I* could fathom <br/>
happening. I can only help prepare them as much as possible and let <br/>
them find their way.<br/>
<br/>
Duncan, 12, flew to Boston on Monday. I knew he could do it because <br/>
*HE* knew he could do it. He had the option of not going---and I don&#39;t <br/>
think he coulda&#39;/woulda&#39; *last* year. But he, himself, was quite <br/>
confident that he could do it *this* year.<br/>
<br/>
*His* confidence gives *me* confidence. If he didn&#39;t think he could do <br/>
it, I would NOT have made him.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s been there almost two full days and hasn&#39;t called me since he <br/>
first got in. He must be doing OK. &lt;BWG&gt; The mom he&#39;s staying with has <br/>
emailed me. I know he&#39;s fine. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Cameron, 20, leaves next week for five weeks in the Yukon. He told me <br/>
today that he would &quot;find a ride&quot; from Portland to Corvallis. I told <br/>
*him* that *I* could find him a ride from Portland to Corvallis. I have <br/>
that power. &lt;G&gt; But he really wants to do some of that himself. Does it <br/>
worry me? You betcha! But not enough for me to worry *him*. I know <br/>
he&#39;ll let me know his plans when he gets there. I won&#39;t be &quot;in the <br/>
dark.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He has a level head and lots of experience making decisions. I trust <br/>
him to be OK and make *more* smart decisions. He won&#39;t take HUGE risks, <br/>
but he *will* take risks. But that&#39;s what life&#39;s about.<br/>
<br/>
I have to be OK with that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1526544290">Well, that *is* hard. If it&#39;s in your head, and he&#39;s not afraid, then  <br/>
the fears are yours and you need to own them.<br/>
<br/>
I was very afraid that Josh would try to cross a major road. We live  <br/>
two blocks from a five lane road and four blocks in every other  <br/>
direction from five lane, 40 mph traffic (mostly college kids late  <br/>
for class, so think 50 mph)<br/>
I told him that crossing those roads weren&#39;t an option for a while,  <br/>
because *I* was not comfortable with it (he was nearly run down  <br/>
walking home from school once, because he honestly didn&#39;t think to  <br/>
stop when a car was coming...and then froze when they honked instead  <br/>
of running as they expected)  But he has a cell phone specifically  <br/>
for those purposes, and I have had to pick him up. He has had to  <br/>
knock on someone&#39;s door to ask for directions because he had no idea  <br/>
where he was and I didn&#39;t recognize the cross streets (in our own one  <br/>
mile section!) But he survived and learned. I survived and learned.  <br/>
The funniest thing was that he found a ditch that went under the  <br/>
road, and when he came home an hour late, was wet up to the knees. I  <br/>
was very concerned, and he grinned and said, &quot;Remember how you said I  <br/>
couldn&#39;t cross any major roads? You didn&#39;t say anything about going  <br/>
UNDER them!&quot; So that was our concession. He still gets lost walking  <br/>
to his friend who lives over there, and that&#39;s part of his brain as  <br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
Naivety is something that they share, and I had to let go of my fear.  <br/>
Even if someone did something that *I* perceived as advantageous  <br/>
(poor video trades, Josh spending all of his money to buy food for  <br/>
those kids etc), he had to do it. He had to realize that 1) those  <br/>
kids were using him and 2) that doing it left him with less cash and  <br/>
not more friends.  We talked about that too, with me being supportive  <br/>
and offering ideas on what to do and what to say (&quot;Sorry guys, I&#39;m  <br/>
saving this for x,y,z&quot; or just not take more than two dollars, or  <br/>
just be happy buying for someone else) It also meant that I went out  <br/>
and built up relationships with all of those other parents (hard for  <br/>
me), so we could say to the kids or the parents, &quot;You know, Josh is  <br/>
really regretting trading this game for that. Is there any way we  <br/>
could get it back?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I dunno, you just feel your way through it, and really examine the  <br/>
problem. Take baby steps if you have to, it&#39;s better than freezing  <br/>
because of fear, but the sooner you let go, the easier it will be.<br/>
<br/>
Is there any way you could tag along behind? We have the added bonus  <br/>
of having siblings, and so I would explain to the kids that Avari  <br/>
wanted to follow them, and asked if it was okay if we did, and they  <br/>
were usually thrilled to have her along. I could play with her, while  <br/>
everyone else was playing, and be aware. Not really step in, but know  <br/>
what was going on so that Josh and I could talk later. Or make some  <br/>
great snacks and deliver them to wherever they are playing, just  <br/>
until you understand in your heart that he will be okay.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-858868109">We live in a great neighborhood, like the one you describe.  I chose <br/>
this home in this location for the freedom it allows my 10 yo son  <br/>
(and our dog, and the safety for our cats) and friendliness amongst <br/>
the &#39;hood.  <br/>
<br/>
The kids run in a pack, going from yard to yard, trampolines,  <br/>
homemede driveway skate ramps, secret forts in the woods.  <br/>
Yesterday, between our yard and our closest neighbor, there were <br/>
about twelve kids, ranging in age from 22 months (my daughter) to <br/>
seventeen years old, along with six to eight adults, and four dogs <br/>
all playing together for hours.  <br/>
<br/>
Although this isn&#39;t possible in some towns or some neighborhoods, <br/>
where this kind of life is possible, it is wonderful!  <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps one of the older kids in the pack could be sort of a lookout <br/>
for your son, if he gets to far away from home, ar begins to feel <br/>
uncomfortable?  As long as he feels safe and knows you are near...<br/>
<br/>
Being truly free is the greatest gift to our unschooled children. <br/>

there&#39;s almost no crime to speak of, ours is more like going back to a<br/>

When a big kid hits a little kid on the playground, we call him a bully;<br/>
five years later he punches a woman for her wallet and is called a mugger;<br/>
later still, when he slugs a fellow worker who insults him, he is called a<br/>
troublemaker, but when he becomes a father and hits his tiresome,<br/>
disobedient or disrespectful child, we call him a disciplinarian. Why is<br/>
this rung on a ladder of interpersonal violence regarded so differently from<br/>
the rest? ~ Penelope Leach<br/>
 Don&#39;t be afraid of showing affection. Be warm and tender, thoughtful and<br/>
affectionate. Mankind is more helped by sympathy than by service. Love is<br/>
more than money, and a kind word will give more pleasure than a present. <br/>

That&#39;s what I tried to get Duncan when I got him his first cell phone, <br/>
but Cingular didn&#39;t sell them anymore. I was really bummed, &#39;cause it <br/>
looked great and I thought he&#39;d like it.<br/>
<br/>
He got a nicer phone than either Ben or I have! &lt;g&gt; It was the one on <br/>
sale---well, FREE!---when I bought his plan.<br/>
