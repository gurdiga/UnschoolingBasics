<div id="ygrps-yiv-1822235117">I think all this reading and absorbing here is changing who i am....   Im on <br/>
a state wide homeschool email group and this post came through and I sit  here <br/>
in tears.   Curious to hear other views and trying to articulate  a <br/>
response....    a brief background the orginial poster was  asking for help cause her <br/>
daughter is getting mouthy and not wanting to  work.  my internal voice is <br/>
saying that maybe nonunschooling loops are not  the place for me anymore!  below <br/>
is the response<br/>

Hi  ,  I know this sounds harsh but I say  to myself:&quot; is there a PARENT <br/>
in this house?!?&quot; and I put a foot down. No  mouthyness, not without harsh <br/>
repercussions. Once, I had a child that I  didn&#39;t allow to speak for a whole <br/>
day - not a word.  A couple of  lectures about respect, responsibility, and <br/>
future goals might be in order.  It&#39;s tough being both parent and teacher, <br/>
but you owe it to the kid to hang  in there! You can do this!<br/>
Days like that, I often declared Chore Days. Once  they realize the choice <br/>
is schoolwork or scrubbing bathrooms, suddenly  essays didn&#39;t look so <br/>
hard.  <br/>
