You&#39;re thinking of the Live and Learn conference, which will take<br/>
place in Albuquerque and can be found at liveandlearnconference.org.<br/>
Re-Thinking Education is in TX every year.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also the NE Unschooling conference in Peabody MA this May if<br/>
you live out East. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2146948819">I&#39;m curious. What&#39;s the difference between Rethinking<br/>
Education conference and Live and Learn conference?<br/>
They both seem to be aimed at unschoolers, but I<br/>
haven&#39;t heard RE being talked about much here or on<br/>
UD.<br/>
<br/>
I spotted one difference by visiting the RE site - it<br/>
seems to have big name speakers, the &quot;experts&quot; if you<br/>
will. L&L seem to have more, umm.., real folks. By<br/>
that I mean people who are unschooling and sharing<br/>
experiences with each other, like on this list. <br/>
Is that the main difference? Are the goals different?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Manisha<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1048172991">&quot;What&#39;s the difference between Rethinking<br/>
Education conference and Live and Learn conference?<br/>

UD.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
While each conference has it&#39;s own flavor, there are also some very<br/>
big differences between these, from what I&#39;ve heard. Having only been<br/>
an L&L attendee, I can&#39;t give you first hand on RE.<br/>
<br/>
I know the lady that runs it is a total unschooler (there was a great<br/>
article about her grown son recently) but I think they allow for a bit<br/>
more &quot;stretch&quot; in the topics presented. Some of the talks lean more<br/>
towards relaxed/eclectic I believe.<br/>
Also, L&L is geared to be very family inclusive. The funshops have all<br/>
ages attending and is very kid friendly. It gets a little hectic<br/>
sometimes too...very bubbly and loud and overwhelming at times, but<br/>
the kids are so involved in everything. I love it.<br/>
<br/>
L&L is the only conference I know of, where ALL of the talks are about<br/>
unschooling and there is huge support for radical unschooling. It&#39;s<br/>
amazing to be surrounded by hundreds of people all treating kids<br/>
respectfully and as equals. My ATC funshop had ALL ages and the adults<br/>
were completely supportive of every single persons work. I&#39;ve never<br/>
been in a community that supports kids with so much respect before.<br/>
It&#39;s pretty awesome. I&#39;m biased of course.:)<br/>
