<br/>
One thing I noticed is the &quot;the things you list&quot; ...Your high-<br/>
schooler may have a better experience if he/she can make their own <br/>
list and you can do the &quot;educationese&quot; translating?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1671469600">First thing is to not be desperate. In order to do that, you&#39;ll need to<br/>
stop thinking there&#39;s a &quot;deadline&quot; that they have to get X, Y, and Z<br/>
done by. There is NO deadline. Your teen&#39;s life will, hopefully, be a<br/>
long progression of learning and doing and Being. Re-read the end of<br/>
Karen&#39;s post about the things she&#39;s done and learned through her life -<br/>
a rather wide range of stuff and NONE of it was stuff that she prepared<br/>
for in school. When she wanted to go from one thing to another, she<br/>
learned what she needed to to make *her* goals happen. It&#39;s way cool!<br/>
<br/>
What IS your teen doing? Maybe we could help better if we knew what it<br/>
is your teen is doing, loves to do, etc. You have to get the &#39;school&#39;<br/>
glasses off to see what is happening because it won&#39;t always look like<br/>
schooled math or even like the readily visible kinds of things like<br/>
doubling recipes or playing obviously numerically related games.<br/>

<br/>
My son was in public school until 5th grade when he became too ill to go to school.  We then tried a year of Waldorf education (unsuccessfully) and after that began more traditional homeschooling with a curriculum. <br/>
<br/>
He spends a great deal of time playing World of Warcraft where he has built skills such as typing and spelling and communication through playing ( many hours per day).

<br/>
He loves to solve problems that others have with their technology - and often comes to Mom&#39;s rescue.  He has built computer systems for friends, and his friends&#39; parents ask for his advice, which has been so empowering for him!  All he wanted for Christmas was the individual componenents of a computer which he then assembled to make a super mega gameplaying system.  I bought an AP computer programming course and he is writing JAVA code.<br/>
<br/>
He reads nonfiction, and recently has found that fiction can be interesting to read; he liked the James Patterson &#39;Maximum Ride&#39; series.<br/>
<br/>
Last year he attended a blacksmithing workshop and want to build his own forge.  After learning about the honeybee crisis last year, he is interested in beekeeping ( we&#39;re attending a workshop on how to set up a hive in Feb).  At various times he has expressed interest in gardening, twig furniture making, and poultry farming among other things.  He watches the science and history channel frequently and is an avid Star Trek fan.   But most of his time currently is invested in World of Warcraft and other video games.<br/>

You&#39;re welcome.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s not so much the *goals*---it&#39;s the very loose *plan* that <br/>
&quot;allows&quot; us to go with the flow of his interests. It&#39;s our curriculum <br/>
(adapted from Carol Narigon&#39;s), but nowhere does it dictate what, when, <br/>
and how we will cover. It reassures doubters, but it also falls way <br/>
short of committing us to anything specific<br/>

<br/>
I have an additional burden of having to justify my methods to an ex <br/>
husband. I<br/>
need to show him  &#39;evidence&#39; of learning, i.e. test scores, in the <br/>
school<br/>
subjects.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Your child is old enough to understand that he may need to &quot;play the <br/>
game&quot; of testing to satisfy his father&#39;s need for testing---IF it comes <br/>
to that.<br/>
<br/>
But I think if you can just start translating what he&#39;s doing into a <br/>
portfolio of learning---a narrative is especially reassuring---the ex <br/>
will be satisfied with a weekly/monthly description of his learning.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I didn&#39;t see you list was Discussion. The majority of my <br/>
boys&#39; learning is through conversations with me, their dad, friends, <br/>
and each other. When they actually ask a question, they are &quot;in the <br/>
moment&quot; of discovery: they WANT that knowledge, so they&#39;re very <br/>
receptive to learning. That discussion/conversation time is a HUGE part <br/>
of our learning here. I write down things we discuss, and you&#39;d be <br/>
surprised at how many things are learned in small two-three minute <br/>
bites of time throughout the day. Commercials are a big source of <br/>
discussion. Sit-coms too. Movies (and Tivo!) allow for a lot of <br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
My biggest suggestion is to dedicate a week to write down everything <br/>
you witness (and things he will come to you about later). Write it all <br/>
down as if you HAD to document. Soon you will see how much he does do. <br/>
It will also allow you to eventually write down &quot;WOW&quot; in your notebook <br/>
as shorthand for *ALL* the things that he&#39;s learning while playing (I <br/>
do this with &quot;Bionicles&quot;---which denotes building (math & physics), <br/>
role-playing (drama), storytelling (composition), design (art), <br/>
cooperation (with a friend) (social skills), and buying new Bionicles <br/>
(economics).)<br/>
<br/>
So---starting when he wakes up, write down everything he does today. <br/>
Quit looking at it as &quot;just play&quot; and start seeing teh actual learning <br/>
that is happening. You&#39;ll be amazed at what all he&#39;s learning. Add it <br/>
up over a week, and you&#39;ll be flabbergasted!<br/>
<br/>
Weekly reports to his dad may look so impressive that he no longer <br/>
needs test scores. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
