<div id="ygrps-yiv-1168130449">Just thought I&#39;d share some of the days events and our warm, snuggly <br/>
Christmasy moments.:)<br/>
<br/>
I went out early to get all the groceries we needed to beat the <br/>
crowds. After returning home, Jalen woke up calling &quot;come read me <br/>
stories Mom!&quot;<br/>
He&#39;s going to be four in February and has recently shown great <br/>
interest in books and being read to more. He&#39;s had unlimited access <br/>
to tv and video games, just for those that have younger ones and <br/>
worry about this issue.<br/>
So we read a Spider-man book (thank Duncan for me Kelly!!) then made <br/>
breakfast. Sierra (7) and good buddy Shai wandered out a bit bleary <br/>
eyed after a late night giggling and watching tv together.<br/>
They had a huge playdough mess all over the table for a <br/>
while...Jalen was throwing playdough blobs through the house and <br/>
saying &quot;I&#39;m destroying the city&quot;, I think he was a power ranger.:)<br/>
<br/>
Another good friend, Katie, was dropped off later so her parents <br/>
could shop. From that point on, my house was a constant swirl of <br/>
kids in and out the door. They played happily outside most of the <br/>
day (which is saying alot, since the temps are LOW for us...must <br/>
have been about 40 at the high and only 33 after the sun went down).<br/>
<br/>
I made a gingerbread house and the kids were all fascinated with the <br/>
affect of heat on sugar. They watched it melt in the pan slowly, <br/>
oohed and aaahed while I glued the house together with the burnt <br/>
sugar and ate up the leftover blobs after they hardened.<br/>
I had seven kids crammed into my little galley kitchen making <br/>
comments and huddling up close to watch at different moments.<br/>
They lit a log in the fireplace and pulled out my S&#39;mores maker to <br/>
roast marshmallows. It was a lovely scene, all these good friends in <br/>
a tight group by the fireplace roasting marshmallows.....good <br/>
memories.<br/>
Sierra cried today when she found out the weather forecast had <br/>
changed and we weren&#39;t getting snow tomorrow night after all. This <br/>
led to a short discussion about how forecasts aren&#39;t always very <br/>
accurate, more like an educated guess. Poor thing really wants a <br/>
white Christmas that has nothing to do with the color of our sand!<br/>
As I write this, Tony Bennett is crooning his Christmas songs and <br/>
Markus is cuddled up with Sierra and Jalen by the fireplace.<br/>
<br/>
My house smells like gingerbread and hot chili leftover from dinner. <br/>
In my room, the gifts are piled high and the wrappings look so <br/>
festive (let&#39;s not talk about how I can&#39;t walk in there because it&#39;s <br/>
such a disaster:).<br/>
I love this time of year, and I love that my family is happily <br/>
together, learning and playing. I love that melting sugar on the <br/>
stove can be so much fun and that we have neighbor kids that are so <br/>
sweet. For this moment, all is well...may everyone have a magical, <br/>
free, joyful holiday, in whatever way you might celebrate.:)<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

<br/>
We have been having a great holiday as well.  We are a Pagan/Christian blended family.  On the Solstice, dh was traveling.  So the kids and I spent the day without electric lights to enjoy the darkness.  I had made small gifts for the kids (boxes for the boys and beaded bracelets for the girls).<br/>
<br/>
Each day we have done various arts and crafts and our house now looks like it has pretty much snowed glitter.  It is really cold for Texas so the kids are spending a lot of time indoors which is unusual for them.<br/>
<br/>
Last night, we went out to eat and then down to the River Walk in San Antonio to see it decorated with lights.  Since it was so cold, it wasn&#39;t crowded and the kids could have more &quot;elbow-room.&quot;  There is an outdoor theatre there that the kids love to play on.<br/>
<br/>
We noticed an entire group of policemen there and soon found out that one was going to surprise his girlfriend (who was riding a tourist boat) with a marriage proposal.  The kids loved that so we stuck around (my 11yo has recently discovered girls and was very interested to see how this was done)and got to see the young officer go down on his knee to ask her and her tears of joy.  By this time, a bit of a crowd had gathered and everyone cheered.<br/>
<br/>
Well, time to go feed some very chilly goats.<br/>
<br/>
Merry Christmas, Happy Kwanzaa and Happy Solstice from Texas<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-315363575">Okay, well, now I have to ask: Why do you use melted sugar as glue <br/>
rather than royal icing? Am I showing my total gingerbread construction <br/>
ignorance here? ;)<br/>
<br/>
Happy Holidays to all!<br/>

--Danielle, who every year swears this is the year she will attempt a gingerbread house, but every year has something more pressing to do!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-181597013">&quot;Last night, we went out to eat and then down to the River Walk in <br/>
San Antonio to<br/>
see it decorated with lights.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ooh...I LOVE the river walk, we&#39;d love to see it again.<br/>
<br/>
As to Danielle&#39;s question about gingerbread houses, I use the melted <br/>
sugar because it sets almost instantly and really holds well. It&#39;s <br/>
like hot glue that&#39;s edible!:) You have to be careful, cause it <br/>
burns pretty bad if you get it on your skin, but it really holds <br/>
like cement. My Mom did it that way, so that&#39;s probably more the <br/>
reason than anything.:)<br/>
Gingerbread houses were a yearly tradition with my family so I <br/>
really love making them. I&#39;ve taken a break the last couple of <br/>
years, so it was time to do one again. We kept it simple, it&#39;s <br/>
fairly smallish.<br/>
My Mom always did an elaborate house with scenery surrounding it, <br/>
including figurines a small pond, Santa and Mrs. Claus etc...The <br/>
whole thing was sprinkled with powdered sugar to look like snow and <br/>
a light under the house lit up the windows (covered with yellow <br/>
tissue to make it look even more lovely.<br/>
So my wee house looks shameful by comparison, but I&#39;m not about to <br/>
spend the amount of time on these things that my mother did. I&#39;d <br/>
rather play with the kids.<br/>
<br/>
OH, and that sugar glue tastes a LOT better than frosting in my <br/>
opinion. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My mom had all the grandkids over every year to make gingerbread houses.<br/>
<br/>
She saved little milk cartons for them to use as a base.<br/>
<br/>
They used graham crackers - stuck them to the milk cartons with <br/>
powdered sugar frosting (cream of tartar added, to make it harden <br/>
better).<br/>
<br/>
So - white frosting - big bowls of it, milk cartons, and graham <br/>
crackers. With strong paper plates as a base - those are the main <br/>
supplies.<br/>
<br/>
The extras - things to decorate with - red vines, pretzel sticks, gum <br/>
drops, mini-marshmallows, gummy bears or other little gummy figures, <br/>
skittles, red hots, chocolate chips, animal crackers, life savers, etc. <br/>
Not always all the same stuff - but a lot of different things. Over the <br/>
years the kids made INCREDIBLE creations - never satisfied with a <br/>
pretty little gingerbread house. And even though this was an activity <br/>
for the kids - we adults almost ALWAYS ended up making one, too. It was <br/>
irresistible.<br/>

<br/>
We did the Graham cracker thing last year with our homeschool group. <br/>
I hadn&#39;t thought of the milk carton idea..that would be especially <br/>
good for little hands.<br/>
Me being anal about gingerbread houses, had already glued many <br/>
houses together with the burnt sugar before we arrived.:) They <br/>
looked very festive and fun laid out on the table afterwards. Some <br/>
of the houses were piled so high they looked as though they should <br/>
collapse. Graham crackers are a wonderful invention!:)<br/>
