<div id="ygrps-yiv-667530757">&quot;*Anyway* we&#39;ve recently gotten back involved and there is a very active<br/>
&quot;minister of children&quot; who is very enthusiastic about doing things<br/>
with the kids and helping them feel included&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She sounds horrid. The last &quot;minister of children&quot; was a gentleman<br/>
that had some mental disabilities (minor) but was SO sweet and would<br/>
just follow the toddlers around and keep them corraled safely. He&#39;d<br/>
put out playdough and fun stuff at the events, but the kids could come<br/>
and go. I really liked him.<br/>
<br/>
Too bad they have a new one. I&#39;m sorry. You need to hook up with Chris<br/>
(don&#39;t remember her SCA name), the Scottish lady that is a loud<br/>
proponet of breastfeeding and although her kids went to school, she<br/>
gave them loads of freedom.<br/>

move to have him removed from all the children&#39;s activities altogether.<br/>
There are parents who are uncomfortable with the way he plays with the<br/>
children.  they think he is being inappropriate and the MOC is leading this<br/>
campaign.  :(  I knew Edward way back when and he is just, hm, &quot;simple&quot; and<br/>
sweet.<br/>

was fantastic, but she was a bit upset at Keon becasue he didn&#39;t want to<br/>
stay with the group and prefered to hang out with Edward and play with the<br/>
small bow and arrow set.  Keon and Edward get along fabulously.  Chris is<br/>
Lady Margaret and also someone I know from &quot;way back when&quot; and she agrees<br/>
that this should be fun.  Her &quot;baby&quot; is six feet tall now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-240557938">I meant to apply to the original, but wanted to say yeah, it makes me  <br/>
feel kind of icky for you, Michelle. Too bad about Edward...I am more  <br/>
aware than ever of the special gifts that differently abled people  <br/>
offer to our children to learn, and it sounds like he&#39;s spent a lot  <br/>
of time doing just that. I would hate to think that this was one of  <br/>
his few social outlets and that the evil MOC is trying to take that  <br/>
away. (Okay, evil is strong, but I started to sink into one of my  <br/>
fantasy novels hee)<br/>
<br/>
Much hugs to you and Keon. Freedom for the Children, will be our  <br/>
rallying cry!!!<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, he IS this very sweet and simple guy. He truly LOVED the kids.<br/>
He&#39;s a treasure, but most folks just don&#39;t understand. In spite of his<br/>
simple nature, he was VERY aware of keeping the children safe...he<br/>
watched Jalen like a hawk and loved every minute of it. He&#39;s one of<br/>
the only guys that my children took an immediate liking to...very<br/>
rare. They&#39;d run up and give him hugs, but wouldn&#39;t even talk to other<br/>
adults.<br/>
<br/>
He spoke their language I think. It&#39;s too bad our society doesn&#39;t<br/>
value that. Unschooling ROCKS!<br/>
