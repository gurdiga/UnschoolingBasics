An everyday plan can feel like you&#39;re serving the plan.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Depends how you&#39;d put that into practice ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Be mindful of their needs. If they&#39;re active kids who tend to have  <br/>
strong ideas about what they want to do, be their facilitator. If  <br/>
they&#39;re more joiners, set things up for them that support their  <br/>
interests or bring new stuff through their lives. If they need to do  <br/>
things themselves, step back but keep aware of the moods and  <br/>
environment. If things are winding down, be ready to grab one of the  <br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
For all kinds of kids, be interested in life yourself and bring things  <br/>
into their lives that they might find cool. They can&#39;t be interested  <br/>
in things they don&#39;t know about!<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t wait for them to take charge or be the one in charge. Be what  <br/>
they need you to be to keep their lives as interesting, joyful,  <br/>
nurturing as they would like it to be.<br/>
<br/>
Stay connected with them. Most likely their favorite thing to interact  <br/>
with is you! :-) Be near them even when they&#39;re involved in something.<br/>

nothing as in a complete hands off approach).<br/>

One of the things you are learning about right now is the natural daily rhythms of your family. Those will shift around a bit over time  as your kids get older, need less sleep, have different interests etc, but there&#39;s a tremendous value to knowing the natural ups and downs of the daily rhythm of your life. It lets you do a little planning And go with the flow. <br/>
<br/>
You can plan relaxing things for &quot;down&quot; times - if your kids get cranky-tired in the afternoons, for example, you can plan to put in a movie and get everyone settled for a bit of a rest even if no-one but you actually wants a nap.<br/>
<br/>
Or, for instance, my daughter tends to get very focused on projects during the course of the day - from about mid-morning to lunch and then again in the afternoon, and then she&#39;ll want to change gears and play video games for a couple hours. So any kind of planning works Around her natural routine. If we&#39;re going out, its better to leave before she gets settled in with a project. <br/>
<br/>
Games and puzzles, though, are generally good things to &quot;strew&quot; - have them available but don&#39;t necessarily plan them. If kids are watching tv, you could get out a puzzle or some craft project to do in the same room and they might join you, but don&#39;t make a big deal. I find simple house cleaning does a lot to freshen things up and bring attention to toys and games which have gotten lost in the shuffle (which probably says something about my house-keeping!) so I don&#39;t really have to say &quot;oh, let&#39;s try this&quot; - its more like &quot;hey, I forgot we had one of these!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Actually, the harder thing about unschooling is that kids want to learn about things at the Darnedest times! Right when you&#39;re drifting off to sleep, someone wants to know what plutonium is, or where butterflies go when they migrate, or how Godzilla got to be so big - and there you are, totally unprepared and the kids want to learn some really cool. All the planning in the world won&#39;t give you that! And its soooooo worth it, even when you&#39;re tired, to see your kid being excited about something some other parent would be pleased to tell you he&#39;d never, ever learn unless you made him. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-958026993">Plan &quot;bigger&quot; things, like trips out of the house, to the zoo, the beach, the children&#39;s museum. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Plan things that require a lot of planning, like playing with dry ice: have the spoons ready, the liquid soap handy, and plenty of space on your camera. &lt;g&gt; Go get the ice, and hurry home to play.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you have a &quot;Family Game Night&quot; (both my boys had an interest at different times), make sure all the games have all their pieces, order the pizza, and be sure the ice cream supply is high.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Littler kids (and one of my bigger kids) often like to know what&#39;s happening the next day, this morning, or after the baby&#39;s nap. I often planned our days: we&#39;ll play with pudding on Monday afternoon. Friends are coming all day on Tuesday to swim. We&#39;re making sushi on Wednesday for supper, so a lot of early prep. Taking off to the beach on Thursday. Friday: making bubbles and playing Banangrams. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As long as I&#39;m flexible, we can always postpone something or move it up. Talk with your kids. Be creative. Be patient. Be flexible. It&#39;ll come naturally as you learn to let go of schoolish expectations.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Do they like having a menu of pictures like that? Some kids find it overwhelming. It&#39;s something to try if you want - its Okay to try things, experiment a little and find out what&#39;s going to work in your real life with your real kids. Some families have picture-lists for food, for instance, because it helps some kids know what they want to eat. Or pictorial &quot;wish lists&quot; to help with big-ticket shopping. Other families don&#39;t find those useful. <br/>
<br/>
If none of your kids are likely to climb the shelves (a real concern in some homes) just having boxes and bins with the labels clearly visible from the floor can be enough for kids to look and think about what they want.<br/>
<br/>
You could also rotate whatever&#39;s out and about as things seem to get stale, if you tend to store things out of sight (either intentionally or otherwise).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I guess I&#39;m trying to figure <br/>

<br/>
The way my house is organized now is not the way it was organized a year ago - some big things are the same, but I&#39;ve moved books, games, computers, furniture, etc to adapt to the changing needs of various family members. Needs will change with the seasons and with development - and with random factors like plans to go on a trip or making a new friend or getting a new pet. It&#39;s better to think in terms of useful tools and strategies, of trying out ideas and making choices based on what you observe. That&#39;s the essence of unschooling - you watch and think and try and watch and think some more. Or as Sandra puts it: read a little, try a little, wait a little, watch. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1710776831">My plan is to be with my kids every day, whatever shape or form that<br/>
takes.  Sometimes we have things we&#39;re doing, so we HAVE to plan around<br/>
that, and because of my schedule we usually plan WAY ahead for specific<br/>
events.  Sometimes we hang out all day, watch TV, build with blocks, make<br/>
art, read books.  We have Fun List that we&#39;re working through and adding<br/>
to as time goes on, so if one of those opportunities pops up we plan to do<br/>
that.  If my son wants to do a class, we plan to do that, and I really try<br/>
to limit us to doing one class a week at most, of course with the<br/>
understanding that if he really wanted to take another we would make it<br/>
happen.  It&#39;s all very fluid and responsive.<br/>
<br/>
I do not plan learning unless it&#39;s something the kids have said they do. <br/>
Then we do it.  I actually find that this comes VERY naturally for me with<br/>
little anxiety.  My kids are also quite young and they have never gone<br/>
through deschooling (besides me deschooling myself so I can unschool) so<br/>
it&#39;s a lot of the same stuff we&#39;ve done since they were born.  The reality<br/>
is that for most attached, involved and present parents, they unschool<br/>
until they send their kids to school.  They just don&#39;t realize that what<br/>
they&#39;re doing is facilitating learning from the beginning.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that helps.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, yes, good point!<br/>
<br/>
A big part of my personality has a need for &quot;the best&quot;. The products  <br/>
that work the best. The best way to do things. The best place for  <br/>
pizza :-)<br/>
<br/>
But there is no best. There are things that turn someone toward their  <br/>
goal. And things that turn them away. And sometimes one &quot;thing&quot; can  <br/>
have bits that move toward and bits that move away.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is most people don&#39;t turn their goals into words or  <br/>
prioritize them. They have this vague fog of what seems best to them.  <br/>
Which makes it harder to move toward or away!<br/>
<br/>
Think about what you value. What kind of home do you want? What&#39;s it  <br/>
important for your kids to have?<br/>
<br/>
If any of those goals involve changing your kids, think about how you  <br/>
can change yourself and make that a part of your life and part of the  <br/>
things you do. Be who you would like your kids to be. If they find  <br/>
value in it for their lives, they&#39;ll be drawn to it.<br/>
<br/>
Make a list :-) And then keep revisiting the list and revising,  <br/>
changing the priority of some, adding and subtracting to the list.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;I guess I&#39;m trying to figure<br/>

 </span></blockquote>For unschooling, find the things that increase joy and peace for your  <br/>
kids. Those things will be as individual as your kids. It will totally  <br/>
depend on their personalities and what they&#39;re trying to get from life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-504286976">***So true and also the reason why I find &quot;learn nothing day&quot; (or whatever it&#39;s called) so funny and ludicrous.  There&#39;s no way that you can learn nothing at all in a day of living LOL**<br/>
<br/>
:) That&#39;s the point.<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of people who are convinced, truly convinced, their children will learn nothing if the parents don&#39;t orchestrate it all. Challenging them to try, just TRY to learn NOTHING pokes gentle fun at that notion.<br/>

Some fun conversations come up around Learn Nothing Day every year, too. This year, with people posting cheerful comments about having failed to learn nothing, a discussion got going on facebook about the value of failure and mistakes and how learning often depends on those things. It&#39;s a &quot;just for fun&quot; holiday for sure, but sometimes even silly ideas can be wonderful fodder for thought and (ahem) learning ;)<br/>
