<div id="ygrps-yiv-1029300821">I&#39;m pretty new to the unschooling way of life and so far have really <br/>
been excited about this new lifestyle as I feel it is so respectful <br/>
of my kids and I really want to see them flourish.  However, here is <br/>
my question regarding food control/issues.  For about 3 weeks now, <br/>
I&#39;ve been letting my kids make their own choices about food but I <br/>
have also been preparing lots of healthy snacks and meals for them to <br/>
have as choices as well. <br/>
<br/>
My son has really been excited about having some &quot;fun&quot; <br/>
options/choices and has been really focusing on eating lots of ice <br/>
cream, cookies, candy, etc. Some days he does make some other <br/>
choices...like grilled cheese, eggs.  I find that he has been making <br/>
choices that *I* consider more healthy so I believe he will *balance* <br/>
out once he truly realizes that he has these choices available to him <br/>
when he wants them but I noticed tonight that he is putting on <br/>
weight.  I don&#39;t mean to sound focused on his appearance but I&#39;m <br/>
starting to have some fear that he may gain a lot of extra weight <br/>
during this time of exploring his choices and that he may then have <br/>
some problems getting rid of the weight, now or when he is older.  My <br/>
husband was a heavy kid and his family has a tendency to be on the <br/>
heavier side; he fears this too.  And it is not just appearances, I <br/>
worry about his health.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to hear from anyone who has feedback/comments. <br/>
Thanks so much!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2108200682">How old is your DS? There are normal times when kids DO put on weight and *need* to do so because they are growing. I know with my DS, he &quot;inchworms&quot; so to speak - he&#39;ll get a visible bit of a belly, then he&#39;ll shoot up an inch or two, then stabilize, then repeat. I&#39;ve had the occasional anxious thought about it because weight issues run in both families along with hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes (I&#39;m type 2, diagnosed 2 years ago). BUT I remind myself of the pattern he&#39;s had since he was a baby. And I make sure that nutritious stuff is available - not hard since he&#39;s come to prefer our homemade whole grain options to most store bought stuff (except one brand of organic oreo-like cookies - he prefers them to true Oreos because he says they&#39;re creamier inside). Also, if I&#39;m getting anxious about it, I make an extra effort to find/offer/do myself some more active things like suggesting a visit to one of our favorite nature/walking trails (we go in just about any season, provided it&#39;s not pouring rain or snowing). On his own, he&#39;s decided that riding the exercise bike while reading whatever his current book is works out well for him. We got the bike for me to use but I&#39;ve decided I prefer our treadmill and DS uses the bike more often. It&#39;s quiet, it&#39;s convenient, and he can ride whenever he wants (Because it&#39;s quiet) sometimes he&#39;ll jump on the bike at 11 pm and read a bit as DH and I are heading to bed. He&#39;s determined that 5 minutes on the bike is enough for him to read one chapter in his Bionicle series book. So, he&#39;ll do 5 minutes here and there. He&#39;s also 10 Â½ so I know that he&#39;s heading into a pre-puberty time when he&#39;s likely to add weight before he sprouts up taller than me. We&#39;ve never regulated his eating in his life (aside from &quot;Well, we&#39;re out of oranges, it&#39;ll have to wait until grocery shopping on Saturday but I&#39;ll go ahead and add it to the list right now&quot;) so it&#39;s not quite the exact same situation - he has no concerns that we&#39;re going to take away something anytime soon.<br/>

on the heavier side (like me) and some have health problems - but its <br/>
not an exact correspondence. I&#39;ve found it helpful in thinking about <br/>
my own weight and health (and my kids&#39;) to separate those two <br/>
concepts. <br/>
<br/>
Something else to keep in mind is that some kids naturally &quot;bulk up&quot; <br/>
before a growth spurt. My kids&#39; eating habits both change right <br/>
before they shoot up another inch or so - lots more proteins *and* <br/>
fats. <br/>
<br/>

he eats, the more successful he&#39;ll be if he decides to change his <br/>
habits. <br/>
