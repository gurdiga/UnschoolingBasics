There are a lot of reasons. You&#39;ll develop a tribe that will keep you sane  <br/>
when you&#39;re getting negative messages from your family. If you go through a <br/>
hard  time, you&#39;ll know people who can support you. You&#39;ll meet older kids that <br/>
will  show you that you are, indeed, making a responsible choice for your <br/>
children&#39;s  learning life. You&#39;ll develop (and your kids will) a confidence in <br/>
talking about  unschooling that may just win your family over. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1404690163">Hi Kathryn<br/>
   <br/>
  We are new to unschooling and would love to attend a conference. The one in Mass. might be very possible....we live on Long Island.....I am curious if there are any trains from here that we can possibly take that you might know of ?? I will have to research how the drive is.....I am a chicken. <br/>
   <br/>
  Thanks<br/>
  Karen :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I second that. Also, you can feed them (family and friends) info in small<br/>
bites. My parents didn&#39;t understand attachment parenting. I would just say<br/>
well I&#39;m giving her roots. They were afraid I was isolating her by always<br/>
having her with me. I assured them I would give her wings and thow her out<br/>
of the nest.<br/>
<br/>
My parents came to visit when Lyndsey was 3 1/2. As they were leaving my mom<br/>
said I was doing a great job. My dad and I both dropped our jaws. Sometimes<br/>
it just takes time to see what you believe.<br/>
