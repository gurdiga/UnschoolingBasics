<div id="ygrps-yiv-2033881081">Hi! ~ I&#39;m a lurker here for the most part : ) My 2 children are on the <br/>
unschooling path and this list has been tremendously helpful..thanks <br/>
to all!  I&#39;m posting today because I have a 6 yo daughter who is <br/>
looking for some penpals and I thought this may be the best place to <br/>
find some penpals for her!  If anyone has any suggestions or if your <br/>
kids are looking for penpals ~ I&#39;d love some help.  Thanks ~<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-860332868">I just asked my seven year old daughter and she would LOVE!!! (She <br/>
told me to write it that way, capitols and exclamation points. LOL) <br/>
