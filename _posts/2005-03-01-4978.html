&quot;Not all  daycares situations are schooly,<br/>
and not everyone can be a stay at home mom  (or dad). I don&#39;t find my <br/>
situation<br/>
sad at all. Though I will admit  that I may be a little <br/>
defensive. :~}&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t be defensive!!:) I  think you&#39;re an incredibly aware parent, <br/>
finding such a creative solution  for allowing your child to stay out <br/>
of school.<br/>
Not everyone has a  full-time partner in this adventure. I&#39;m always <br/>
encouraging single parents  to look at other options if their <br/>
children don&#39;t want to be in school! I  think you&#39;ve found a really <br/>
great one.<br/>
I was fortunate enough to have  plenty of support for my 6 month <br/>
stint as a single parent. I know that  even if something happened to <br/>
my dh or I, my children could continue their  unschooling adventures.<br/>
It&#39;s great to read about single parents making  things work.<br/>
<br/>
A close friend here in Pensacola is trying to come up with  solutions <br/>
for keeping her dd out of school....she&#39;s asking other  homeschooling <br/>
parents to babysit. Right now she&#39;s in a very small daycare  <br/>
situation.<br/>
Not all parents with children in school or daycare are part  of <br/>
mainstream practices.<br/>
Some of my good friends are huge supporters of  unschooling but their <br/>
children have chosen school for right now. Their  children don&#39;t have <br/>
all the baggage that most school kids do, because  their parents <br/>
counter all that crap. It&#39;s working for them. The children  know they <br/>
can come home any time, that grades don&#39;t matter, and that the  <br/>
parents will support their interests.<br/>
<br/>
School and daycare don&#39;t have  to be horrible for children, it  <br/>
depends.<br/>

************************<br/>
Before Julian was born (he&#39;s now 15), his dad, my partner, and I all worked  <br/>
in daycare.  At about 6 months Julian started going a couple  of mornings a <br/>
week to a family that were good friends, and had a child in  the center where <br/>
J&#39;s dad worked. <br/>
 <br/>
Then before he was 3, he went with his dad to the day care center. By the  <br/>
time he was 4, none of us worked in day care anymore, and he was with me until  <br/>
he started Kindergarten. We pulled him out after 3rd grade.<br/>
 <br/>
Interestingly, many of the families I worked with in that day care center  <br/>
homeschooled after the experience with the center. It was a funky day care  <br/>
center started by a bunch of cool hippy-types 15 years before we made a  <br/>
connection there. It was very child-centered and sweet, not stressing academics.  When <br/>
a bunch of the kids reached Kindergarten age, their parent pleaded with us  to <br/>
start a Kindergarten program for them, and we did.  They weren&#39;t ready  to <br/>
send their kids to &quot;regular&quot; school, and we were happy to keep them.<br/>
 <br/>
After that year, most of those kids either stayed, went to alternative  <br/>
programs, or started homeschooling. <br/>
 <br/>
Being home full-time is not an option, or desireable, for everybody. The  <br/>
trick is finding wonderful places for our kids to be when we can&#39;t be with  them.<br/>
