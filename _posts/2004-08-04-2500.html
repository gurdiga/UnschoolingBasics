Why do  they *want* to watch something that is distressing to them? Is it<br/>
possibly  a minor rebellion against your disapproval? <br/>
<br/>
Maybe we have just been  really lucky. There has *never* been a situation<br/>
where Jayn (4.5) has said  something was scary, and then insisted on watching<br/>
it anyway. She always  asks for fast forward, no sound or hides her face or<br/>
goes away. She will  come and go, slowly gaining her courage. This applies to<br/>
live shows and the  cinema also. She has never (yet) had the kind of<br/>
nightmares that others  mention.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Duncan (8) was just in here. He asked whether we could go to a movie  this <br/>
afternoon. We looked online to see what was playing. I suggested _I, Robot_  <br/>
(Will Smith fan! &lt;G&gt;). He said no---it had guns and was really violent. I  told <br/>
him that I thought I could handle the violence. &lt;g&gt;  He said he  didn&#39;t like <br/>
it; could we see Shrek II again?<br/>
 <br/>
So Shrek II it is.<br/>

 <br/>
But I don&#39;t think that, after eight years of respecting and trusting him,  it <br/>
would happen----that he&#39;d want to go.<br/>
 <br/>
OK. Let&#39;s say it did.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m guessing that he would have asked half-way through to leave if he found  <br/>
it disturbing. We&#39;ve never made him &quot;finish&quot; anything, so he doesn&#39;t feel  <br/>
compelled (like my husband and I do) to stay through to the end. We&#39;d  leave.<br/>
 <br/>
If it came on at home, I&#39;d remind him that he&#39;d been frightened, but I&#39;d  let <br/>
him handle the remote and turn it off if/when he needed to. Maybe better  <br/>
would be to rent it so that we could fast forward through the scary parts. HE&#39;D  <br/>
be in control. That&#39;s the important part. That HE could control what he <br/>
watches  and how. That&#39;s what he did today, in fact! (And I got to sit through Shrek <br/>
 II...again---no, I like it! &lt;G&gt;)<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s about learning to deal with your own fears in your own way. It&#39;s  <br/>
empowering them to work through it the best way they can. If that means NOT  going, <br/>
or going and watching again later, so be it. But they need to know that  they <br/>
have the power.<br/>

<h4>Joan Labbe & Salvatore Genovese</h4>
<p><small><time> 4 Aug 2004, at  3:52pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-546216118">I wanted to jump in because this actually happened to us recently.  My kids,<br/>
who have always been sensitive to what they decide is &quot;scary&quot; decided to<br/>
watch &quot;Scooby Doo&quot; (that&#39;s my 5 year old daughter and 3 yr old son).  My<br/>
daughter had always decided from the covers of the Scooby stuff before that<br/>
it looked too scary.  My daughter has found herself scared of &quot;Little Bear&quot;<br/>
before which is the gentlest thing ever, so that&#39;s where we&#39;re working from.<br/>
So we watched it.  The first time, my daughter would run out of the room at<br/>
some of the stuff, and my son would hide behind the pillows.  I reminded<br/>
them how the remote control worked and how they could skip what was scary.<br/>
I reminded them they could turn it off.  They chose the remote control (of<br/>
course, this was a video, so they have that control...and maybe one idea is<br/>
to suggest taping a scary TV show so your son could do the same).<br/>
<br/>
So they used the remote and after each watching they used it less and less.<br/>
Pretty soon episodes they had previously skipped as too scary, they were<br/>
watching.  They did have a few nights with restless sleep on my daughter&#39;s<br/>
part, and some nightmare stuff on my son&#39;s part I thought was related to<br/>
watching it.  The day after the sleep disturbances, they asked to watch it<br/>
again.   The way I responded was to remind them of the sleep disturbances<br/>
and nightmares, and say that I believed they might be related to watching<br/>
Scooby, what did they think?  Because I think what they might need help with<br/>
is hooking up the watching with the nightmares - the connection between the<br/>
two might not occur to them.  In this instance, they said &quot;No, mom&quot;.  I<br/>
respected that and they&#39;ve been watching ever since.  They have not had any<br/>
more sleep disturbances or nightmares since we had that conversation.<br/>
<br/>
Having thought a lot about it, I do not feel it is respectful at all to them<br/>
for me to decide what is too scary FOR them, plus I think they have good<br/>
radar for that and I want to encourage them to challenge what seems scary<br/>
when they want to, while also respecting what feels too scary. At the same<br/>
time, I want to help them.  I can do that by saying about a potential<br/>
movie/show - &quot;Sometimes you&#39;ve said you don&#39;t like certain scary things or<br/>
sad things, and this looks like it could fit into that category&quot; and we talk<br/>
about it.  I make sure that there is no &quot;incidental&quot; TV or shows on that<br/>
they have not chosen - something my husband wants to watch for example - I<br/>
ask him to watch it out of their sight so that they do not end up scared by<br/>
something they just happen to see, they haven&#39;t made a decision about it.  I<br/>
can do it by trying to point out how reactions I see by them like nightmares<br/>
or other things might be related to try to help them make decisions.  But<br/>
the decisions always need to be theirs and I&#39;m available to sit beside them<br/>
and watch too or talk about it.<br/>
<br/>
So my suggestion is instead of deciding for your son, talk to him about the<br/>
nightmares, remind him of the proximity of them to the show and ask him<br/>
about it - does he think they&#39;re related?  Ask him if taping it so he could<br/>
take breaks or skip certain parts of it would help.  Respect that in the end<br/>
only HE really knows what&#39;s too scary for him.  You can be his partner and<br/>
work with him instead of deciding for him and the benefits of doing that are<br/>
enormous.  Both of you will feel respected and like a team instead of<br/>
adversaries.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps...I greatly respect your move out into new territory with<br/>
your son.  Keep going!<br/>
<br/>
Joan<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-237479727">Ok....I see what you are saying.<br/>
  What gets in the way is my: fears,upbringing, control issues etc. right?<br/>
  I can see that. I can also see that I need to allow them to decide and if<br/>
that means leaving something, not eating something they wanted (even though<br/>
it cost money....another of those taught things from childhood) or make<br/>
another choice.<br/>
  If you don&#39;t mind my stepping a little further here and asking.....?<br/>
I know that not everyone  here has a spiritual preference or wants to even<br/>
think about it but it is still  an area of  learning/modeling so the<br/>
principle should be the same, I would think.I am asking to know and not to<br/>
start a debate.<br/>
  If you had spiritual  standards or beliefs and your child at whatever age<br/>
didn&#39;t agree or want to (for lack of a better word.)..abide or live....by<br/>
those beliefs what would you do?This could be for anything from diet choices<br/>
to movies,music etc.<br/>
 I guess an example would be a Mom that felt sugar was detrimental to her<br/>
childs health and spiritually she thought that it was damaging his body<br/>
temple and she with holds it from the child. Yet as the child gets older say<br/>
7-10 ish the child wants it and Mom feels strongly about the belief? Her<br/>
response is to tell the child that she feels uncomfortable about him doing<br/>
that and while he lives in her house he needs to live by those standards<br/>
whether he agrees or not.<br/>
  This scenario is played out in thousands of homes daily.....how could that<br/>
parent model her beliefs with the child to make it possible to find an<br/>
acceptable middle ground for both of them?<br/>

spiritual beliefs or her son&#39;s feelings, her relationship with him.  <br/>
If she has explained her beliefs in a way that makes sense, if she <br/>
lives her beliefs everyday, and has given her son the opportunity to <br/>
make up his own mind about it, chances are he will follow her <br/>
beliefs.  But if he doesn&#39;t, I think she needs to keep in mind that <br/>
they are her beliefs, and not necessarily her sons.  I think forcing <br/>
someone to live by your standards whether they agree or not is <br/>
setting that person up to never agree.  It is setting up resentment <br/>
towards you and the belief.  <br/>
<br/>
I also cringe when I hear parents refer to it as my house.  My house <br/>
belongs to me, my husband and my son.  He lives here and should have <br/>
the same rights as everyone else who lives here.  Just because I&#39;m <br/>
bigger doesn&#39;t mean I have to right to force him to live in a way he <br/>
isn&#39;t comfortable with.<br/>

If my son watched a movie that frightened him and later wanted to watch<br/>
it again I would remind him it had been frightening.   If he said he<br/>
still wanted to see it I would trust that he had a good reason for<br/>
wanting to.   I would watch it with him, let him sleep with me, talk it<br/>
over, look up &quot;the making of&quot; information on-line or any other thing I<br/>
could do that would help him process what he&#39;d seen and heard. <br/>
<br/>
I would think he felt the need to see it.  I may not understand what my<br/>
son is getting from the pursuit of some thing or other but that doesn&#39;t<br/>
mean it isn&#39;t worthwhile. <br/>
<br/>
I have made choices in my life that were frightening (this new haircut!<br/>

be more than what it would cost me.   <br/>

all (I hope my post didn&#39;t give you that impression!) ... I find it<br/>
incredibly uplifting to see someone work as hard as you are obviously doing<br/>

hard work to change thinking patterns and behavioral patterns - I know<br/>

<br/>
I didn&#39;t see a specific response to this - and I don&#39;t know if it got lost<br/>
in the thread, but I think it&#39;s worth singling out.  I&#39;m not a religous<br/>
person, but this morning I thought about something I&#39;ve found difficult and<br/>
how I&#39;ve handled it ... and I&#39;m wondering if anyone else, even if not<br/>
religous, has other examples too.  I think a better other example than the<br/>
one Sharon stated might be, for example, if anyone on this list is<br/>
vegetarian or vegan, with strong underlying beliefs against the killing of<br/>
animals for human consumption, or the treatment of animals to make certain<br/>
foods (the way cows are treated to make veal for example which is a reason I<br/>
personally never eat veal).  How do you handle it if your child asks to eat<br/>
meat or veal - especially since you would likely have to purchase it and<br/>
cook it?  How do you respect and honor what is SO important in unschooling,<br/>
the choices of the child, while still living with your own strong feelings<br/>
and beliefs?<br/>
<br/>
I know that with veal, I would explain to my child what veal is, why I don&#39;t<br/>
eat it which would include an age appropriate description of how they treat<br/>
the cows in the making of it (or I&#39;d just say I didn&#39;t like how they treated<br/>
the cows and see if they wanted to hear more).  I&#39;m hoping that would be<br/>
sufficient to at least make them consider the question.  If they decided<br/>
they wanted to try it anyway, it would be really hard for me, but I think I<br/>
would put my belief in supporting their choosing first, and recognize that<br/>
my feelings about veal are just that, my own feelings, and forcing them on<br/>
my children feels as oppressive as forcing any of my other beliefs and<br/>
feelings on them.  And my feeling is that children who feel things forced on<br/>
them at some point as they get older rebel against those beliefs as not of<br/>
their own choosing.  The reality is that my children will make their own<br/>
choices as they get older and it seems likelier they will be open to at<br/>
least strongly considering what I have to say if I present it as my feelings<br/>
and explain it instead of making a rule about it or insisting it&#39;s going to<br/>
be such and such a way because it&#39;s &quot;my house&quot; - actually I believe it is<br/>
the house of each member of my family - I&#39;d always want them to feel that<br/>
way.  In other words, I&#39;d never want to alienate my child over the issue of<br/>
veal, or any other particular issue.  I&#39;d value my relationship with them<br/>
over my desire to have them share any particular belief of mine.  Maybe a<br/>
&quot;compromise&quot; we could agree on is that instead of me having to cook it, we<br/>
go out to eat it at a restaurant (although I am purchasing it in any event,<br/>
at least I don&#39;t have to cook it).<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else struggled with this type of thing?  I&#39;d love to hear the<br/>
thoughts of others...<br/>

*I* just can&#39;t do or support.  I&#39;m not going to tell you not to do it.  I&#39;m <br/>
going to tell you why *I* won&#39;t do it.  If you chose to eat it at someone <br/>
else&#39;s house, or order it with your own money, that&#39;s your choice.  But my <br/>
own ethics will not allow me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Do we really show them how strong our own ethical convictions are if we <br/>
don&#39;t stand by them?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1136725319">Addition to my prior post about veal.  One of the things that turned<br/>
lightbulbs on for me the fastests as I read &quot;The Explosive Child&quot; recently,<br/>
was the author&#39;s modeling of actual conversations with parents and children.<br/>
So, Sharon, in the event this is helpful to you, here is how a conversation<br/>
I feel is respectful to both my children and myself about veal that might<br/>
get us to a compromise might go:<br/>
<br/>
Daughter:  &quot;Mom, I just saw this cool sounding thing called veal you can<br/>
eat.  What does it taste like?  I want to try some.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Me: &quot;Well, I don&#39;t know what veal tastes like.  Veal comes from cows.  I&#39;ve<br/>
decided not to eat it because I saw a TV show about how the cows are treated<br/>
to make veal, and I hated the way the cows are treated.  I don&#39;t want to buy<br/>
veal because that&#39;s supporting the cows being treated in a way I really<br/>
disagree with.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Daughter:  &quot;How do they treat the cows?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Me:  &quot;Well, veal is really tender cow meat.  To make the cow&#39;s bodies that<br/>
tender, they have to keep the cows in a little stall their whole entire<br/>
lives.  The cows never get to go outside that stall, ever.  It really<br/>
bothers me to think of an animal spending their whole life in a dark stall.<br/>
It angers me that people would do that to animals for any reason, and I<br/>
really have a hard time with people doing it so their meat is more tender.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Daughter (assuming she&#39;s not persuaded): &quot;Well, I really want to try it<br/>
anyway.  Can you make some for me?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Me:  &quot;Well, I respect that you make the choice about what you want to eat.<br/>
But this does require my involvement if you want me to go to the store, buy<br/>
veal, then cook it.  I think that would be a really hard thing for me to do.<br/>
I&#39;m having a hard time picturing myself doing it.  How do you think we could<br/>
resolve this?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Daughter:  &quot;Well, maybe I could go to a restaurant with Dad and have some.<br/>
That way you don&#39;t have to buy it or cook it or be there when I eat it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Me:  &quot;Good idea.  Dad doesn&#39;t have these strong feelings I do about veal.<br/>
Let&#39;s go talk to him.&quot;<br/>

 <br/>
MY ethical conviction is that school is emotionally, psychologically,  <br/>
physically, and educationally damaging. Would I &quot;allow&quot; my kids to go to school  if <br/>
they wanted to? Yes. They needs to draw their own conclusions and make their  <br/>
own decisions. They&#39;re smart. They&#39;re informed. <br/>
 <br/>
I doubt they&#39;ll decide to go to school. <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve been a vegetarian twice in my life. Right now, my husband and my 16  <br/>
year son are vegetarians. Duncan and I eat meat. Suppers have started to SUCK! I  <br/>
cook waaaay too much and too many different things. And I&#39;m starting to just  <br/>
keep burrito/quesadilla fixin&#39;s in the &#39;frig&#39; so that everyone can make his <br/>
own  version---with or without meat. (I hate this!) Welcome to supper! :-P~~~~*<br/>
 <br/>
But eating meat all his life didn&#39;t make Ben or Cameron stay  omnivorous. <br/>
Being a vegetarian when I was five and 14 didn&#39;t make me stay  vegetarian.<br/>
 <br/>
We EACH have to come up with our own beliefs. Pushing the belief that  school <br/>
is necessary in the real world is useless when talking to me. Pushing  that <br/>
veal should never be eaten is just as bad. He&#39;ll make the  correct decision for <br/>
him when he has all the information, pro and  con.<br/>

<br/>
I think these are good questions, Kelly, and they show why this is such a<br/>
difficult issue.  Thanks for responding to it.  I can&#39;t speak for the murder<br/>
issue because those are not my beliefs.  I will answer your last question<br/>
however from my perspective.  I can tell my daughter or son hwo strong my<br/>
ethical convictions are and show them by my example of what I do.  I don&#39;t<br/>
think I have to &quot;show&quot; them the strength of those convictions by making<br/>
their decisions for them.  That said, I don&#39;t think what you&#39;re saying above<br/>
is necessarily deciding &quot;for&quot; them ... it&#39;s letting them know that it isn&#39;t<br/>
something you could tolerate around you and that you need for their choice<br/>
(which you&#39;re still supporting) to be done in a way that doesn&#39;t involve<br/>
you.  That I would support.  What I&#39;m nervous about is parents taking away<br/>
the choices altogether because children &quot;have&quot; to believe what parents<br/>
do.....<br/>
<br/>
So I think I agree with your response in the situation but I don&#39;t think<br/>
that&#39;s &quot;showing them the strength of your convictions&quot; as much as working<br/>
out a way to have the child be able to choose and still have the parents<br/>
feelings considered.<br/>

Recently there were posts on a local pagan e--group about a Jamaican <br/>
musician, known for anti-gay lyrics, coming to town and how people should <br/>
know so they could decide about attending, etc.  Some people seemed to <br/>
bending over backwards in favor of &quot;free speech.&quot;  All about how Jamaica <br/>
has an anti-gay culture, blah blah blah.<br/>

Sorry, the guy&#39;s a bigot who spreads his message through his music.  If my <br/>
kids wanted to go, I wouldn&#39;t stop him, but I wouldn&#39;t soft pedal my <br/>
opinion.  And he&#39;d have to find his own ticket money. And if I could get <br/>
away with it, his own ride.<br/>

<br/>
*My* ethical conviction leads me to live my life a certain way.  It does<br/>
not afford me power to insist others live *their* lives *my* way. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a vegan.  My son is too, for now.  He may always be, or he may not. <br/>
<br/>
I can only choose for myself.  He can only choose for himself.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like the idea of my fellow Earthlings dying for my convenience so<br/>
I&#39;ve chosen not to eat or wear them.   I *do* get into a drive a car a<br/>
few times a week and under the wheels and against my grill and windshield<br/>
many of my fellow Earthlings lose their lives.   How do I ethically live<br/>
with this?<br/>
<br/>
My house is made from wood.  It&#39;s an old house.  I didn&#39;t kill the trees<br/>
but by golly they&#39;re dead and it&#39;s for my convenience.  <br/>
<br/>
I cut my grass so my neighbors don&#39;t have to live next to a place they<br/>
can&#39;t stand to look at.  I use a push mower but I know lots of my fellow<br/>
Earthlings die in those blades.  <br/>
<br/>
I by food at the grocery store that had to flown in or trucked because I<br/>
live in a location where I can&#39;t grow all my own food.  Do I know which<br/>
planes hit a flock of birds or which truck smacked a heard of Elk? <br/>
<br/>
Do I know which CEO of which grocery store poisons neighborhood cats or<br/>
shoots gophers?  <br/>
<br/>
Even when we think we have the rightest of the right answers there are <br/>
always more questions.  Even when we think we can live with ourselves<br/>
there is always room to question our own hypocrisies.  <br/>
<br/>
I will make my choices in the best way I know in order that I can stand<br/>
to look at myself on the occasions I actually do, and when I know a<br/>
better way hopefully I&#39;ll be ethical enough to improve.  <br/>
<br/>
My hope for my son is that he&#39;ll feel free enough and powerful enough to<br/>
make his own choices.  <br/>

  I appreciate all you have shared. Thanks Joan for bringing this issue up.<br/>
It has given me an idea on how to talk with my kids yet allow them to follow<br/>
their ideas and convictions without giving up mine.<br/>
  I realize that you all were stepping out and looking at it from a &quot;what if<br/>
this happened&quot; in my family instead of already having experienced it.<br/>
That meant alot to me.It is easy to by pass something because either it isn<br/>

 Again thank you everyone for sharing. I am going to use some of the<br/>

**I&#39;m a vegetarian for ethical reasons.  Everyone else in the family eats<br/>
meat at least occasionally.  We don&#39;t have &#39;your own money&#39; in our family.<br/>
My husband&#39;s paycheck and the money I earn selling jewelry is our money.<br/>
It&#39;s Jon&#39;s and mine and Dagny&#39;s and Rowan&#39;s.  If one of them asks me to buy<br/>
a happy meal I will.  Our bank won&#39;t give my kids an atm card (which pisses<br/>
me off but is a whole nother subject &lt;g&gt;), and neither one is comfortable<br/>
carrying much money around, so for now I&#39;m their bank and they get to their<br/>
money through me.   It doesn&#39;t violate my ethics to give them the assistance<br/>
they need from me to get what they want. It *would* violate my ethics to<br/>

<br/>
I was a vegetarian from the mid 1980&#39;s until I came to Los Angeles in 1994<br/>
when I succumbed to the lure of sushi and added fish to my Ovo-Lacto diet.<br/>
Then I got pregnant. No sushi for a while. I started eating meat again after<br/>
Jayn started eating &quot;real meals&quot; in 2000 - basically because cooking up to 3<br/>
different meals for every meal was driving me crazy, and dh&#39;s steaks looked<br/>
too good. Then I removed nutmeats and peanuts from my diet once I realized<br/>
Jayn was allergic to them in case it was in my milk somehow.<br/>
<br/>
I expected all sorts of problems and weight gain, but didn&#39;t find any. Alas<br/>
no weight loss either. Then I did have a problem. What was going on?<br/>
Allergic to chicken? IBS? Nope. Turns out I had a creeping onset (not a<br/>
medical term but descriptive) lactose intolerance. Just as well I didn&#39;t<br/>
have to rely on dairy as a primary protein source anymore. It started with<br/>
ice cream, and progressed to all kinds of milk or cheeses. <br/>

them from violent sex - especially rape scenes, etc. Didn&#39;t want those <br/>
images in their heads.<br/>
<br/>
But this was a  matter of my husband and I choosing to watch things <br/>
that we didn&#39;t want them to see ONLY if they were gone or if we could <br/>
go to a movie without them. AND if there was something they really <br/>

Rosie was only about 10 or so when her good friend saw it and loved it <br/>

- and eventually we all watched it together and really enjoyed it. <br/>
