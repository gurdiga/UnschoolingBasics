<div id="ygrps-yiv-303558075">Hi,<br/>
I am new to the group. I have a son, Tommy, who will be 4 at the end <br/>
of the month and a 5 month old dd. We have known we are going to <br/>
unschool for awhile now and are aiming at radical unschooling. I have <br/>
been reading almost everything I can get my hands on about RU and am <br/>
excited about this journey.<br/>
<br/>
My problem is my 4 year old. He is a calm, sweet, child who gets <br/>
overstimulated VERY quickly and then can not control his impulses. <br/>
Because of this I have always limited screen time and had to insist <br/>
on some sort of quiet time in order to ensure he doesnt hurt anyone <br/>
with an aggressive outburst. Well, since I have been doing so much <br/>
reading lately about RUing I have decided to become less coersive and <br/>
try to bring more joy to all of our lives. Therefore, I have let him <br/>
watch TV when he wants and play VG when he wants. This also has led <br/>
us to ditching &quot;quiet time&quot; which has become a source of struggle. <br/>
So, what happens... he starts hitting, spitting, etc when he finishes <br/>
watching TV and anything sets him off (doesnt take much). I have <br/>
tried reasoning with him. He knows it is unacceptable and immediately <br/>
starts crying after he does it. I have tried telling him to hit a <br/>
pillow, take deep breathes, etc. He just cant think before he lashes <br/>
out. <br/>
<br/>
Of course, my traditional parenting brain is telling me to limit the <br/>
screen time again and treat it like an allergy or sensitivity until <br/>
he grows out of this stage. Then the RU part of me feels quilty for <br/>
this because I am limiting his freedom.<br/>
<br/>
Any advice? I am at a loss and really dont want to throw in the RU <br/>
towel :(<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-200453272">Ds just turned 5.  Right before then for a few weeks, there were so many<br/>
changes going on for him all at once.  It&#39;s was another of those huge<br/>
developmental leaps!  He couldn&#39;t take it easy sometimes and often &quot;lost&quot; it<br/>
over the slightest thing.  He was tired a lot.  I made sure to offer plenty<br/>
of protein and anything for brain food: fat and sugar... quick energy.  Ds<br/>
ate a ton of things like grapes, cantaloupe, apples, cheese, and yogurt.<br/>
At times he barely ate and other times he ate like there was no tomorrow.<br/>
He got drained quickly.  He drank more milk than usual.  He didn&#39;t hardly<br/>
want to sleep but when he did sleep it was for longer periods.  Catching<br/>
up.  He&#39;s still doing a good bit of all these things and he&#39;s starting to<br/>
feel better.  He&#39;s also figuring out how to pace himself a little better.<br/>
He&#39;s beginning to simmer down again.<br/>
<br/>
His body is outgrowing his accustomed body knowledge.  Suddenly he grew and<br/>
didn&#39;t know how far his arms and legs go out anymore.  And he inadvertently<br/>
hurts himself and others.  Similar to not realizing it&#39;s time to cut your<br/>
nails and before you get a chance to, it breaks.  This frustrated him no<br/>
end, even though I explained to him that since his body is growing fast,<br/>
it&#39;s just going to take a bit of time to get used to his new size.<br/>
<br/>
Also growing pains.  They&#39;re a beast!  When I was a kid I didn&#39;t know what<br/>
caused my legs to hurt so much sometimes.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Have you read The Explosive Child by Ross Greene?<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/5bhh5r">http://tinyurl.com/5bhh5r</a><br/>
<br/>
Lots of people have said it gave them great insight into their child.<br/>
<br/>
While you&#39;re waiting for it, know that he doesn&#39;t want to be  <br/>
aggressive. I think too often we see children doing something they  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t and assume 1) they don&#39;t care or 2) they don&#39;t understand.<br/>
<br/>
But the truth is 1) either they&#39;re not ready to understand or 2) it&#39;s  <br/>
not important to them yet.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say the first is true. Kids (and adults!) can understand in their  <br/>
heads something is true before they&#39;re able to use the knowledge.  <br/>
(How many smokers know they should quit?) That&#39;s where he is. The  <br/>
more you explain, the more frustrated he&#39;s going to get because  <br/>
you&#39;re treating him as though he&#39;s stupid. Trust that he knows but  <br/>
the pathways from his head to his body aren&#39;t in place yet.<br/>
<br/>
He wants a way he can watch and play without exploding. Talk to him  <br/>
when he&#39;s doing neither and brainstorm some ideas. (And it&#39;s okay if  <br/>
he doesn&#39;t know. Some kids don&#39;t.) Rather than focusing on the goal  <br/>
of getting him to stop ranting, just ask him &quot;What can I do to help?&quot;  <br/>
and be open to new ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Before he goes in to watch or play remind him of what he decided he  <br/>
might do instead. *Not* as a plan he must stick with. Don&#39;t set him  <br/>
up for failure. It&#39;s just an aid to help him remember to try it.<br/>
<br/>
Also be more present. Notice when he&#39;s ramping up and offer some  <br/>
protein snacks. Rather than thinking of this as helping him to stop  <br/>
ranting, think of helping him develop a choice of life long  <br/>
strategies to deal with frustration.<br/>

<br/>
See it as a science experiment. Ask yourself what is different between the two things? What is going on with you when he is watching television or playing video games that isn&#39;t going on when he isn&#39;t doing those things? If you take them as a sort of case-control experiment think about the other things that are going on. So are you feeding him regularly more when he isn&#39;t watching television than when he is? Are you bringing him drinks more or less? Are you touching him more or less? Are you sitting with him more or less? Are you talking with him more or less? Think about the other factors that are coming into play when he is watching t.v. or playing a video game and see if one of those might have the effect that you are blaming on television. <br/>
<br/>
On of the things that might help is to think about Maslow&#39;s Hierarchy of Needs (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs)</a> and see if you aren&#39;t taking care of the lower blocks in his pyramid (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs.svg)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs.svg)</a> as well when the television is on as when it isn&#39;t.<br/>

It&#39;s hard to deal with someone else&#39;s intense emotions. It is wonderful to be able to figure out a cause and eliminate it, like television or video games. Rarely, though, are those actually the issues. I&#39;ve spent a lot of time looking at different studies looking at television and behavior and have found nothing that actually demonstrates that television causes hitting or spitting or screaming and calling names. It has happened in our house. I remember very clearly the day that Simon hit Linnaea for turning off the television. I totally blamed his violence on the television and not on the fact that he was watching something he wanted and Linnaea had turned it off. Television was handy, and known evil. It is nice to have a scapegoat crouching in the corner of the kiving room on which I could heap all of my doubts and fears. In the end though, a scapegoat isn&#39;t anything real and it helps much more to figure out what the actual cause of the problems is or<br/>
 are than to just blame something easy. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>what is this quiet time? Is it him going into his room and playing quietly or lying down for a little bit? Why can&#39;t that be incorporated with television? Can&#39;t you set up a snuggly nest of blankets and pillows and cuddle up with him and watch a show and just zone out so that he gets a sort of idle time? I don&#39;t quite see how watching television excludes quiet time. Or can you get something like legos and sit quietly and build them with him as he watches television? Can you go and rent a dvd that you think he&#39;ll enjoy and snuggle up with him and watch it together, all cozy and relaxed and have that work as quiet time?<br/>

What if he doesn&#39;t grow out of it? What if it is with him for all of his life and the only thing that both of you ever believe is that television is scary and powerful and addictive and makes for bad responses and he always has this split personality that is divided between his enjoyment of televison and video games and his knowledge that it makes him bad. Maybe the stage has to do with the control and it will never get to play itself out as he works out his own relationship with the television and video games. <br/>

change every description of him into something positive.<br/>
Changing the way we think about our kids is the first step toward  <br/>
finding creative solutions. I can&#39;t emphasize enough the power of  <br/>
changing the words we use inside our own heads and in conversation.<br/>
<br/>
Your 4 year old is NOT your problem. In fact, he is giving you a  <br/>
wonderful opportunity to learn something new, to develop some new  <br/>
competencies and skills.<br/>
<br/>
Rephrase it - &quot;I would like to find some ways to better support my 4  <br/>
year old.&quot; Or, &quot;I&#39;m here asking for help in better meeting the needs  <br/>
of my 4 yo.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He is a calm, sweet, child who gets<br/>
&gt; overstimulated VERY quickly and then can not control his impulses.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He&#39;s FOUR. He&#39;s not supposed to have learned to control all his  <br/>
impulses. I bet he controls a lot of them, though. Also, he has a  <br/>
personality/a temperament that is HIM - it may be that he is a person  <br/>
who gets very energized and excited and enthusiastic. This is a  <br/>
WONDERFUL personality trait - he&#39;s the person who will be a natural  <br/>
leader, an inspiration to others.<br/>
<br/>
Are you overvaluing &quot;calm&quot; and &quot;sweet?&quot; (I used &quot;over&quot;valuing on  <br/>
purpose - see how using the prefix &quot;over&quot; is a negative?)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Because of this I have always limited screen time<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;screen time?&quot; You are lumping together whatever it is he is doing as  <br/>
if it is all exactly the same thing if it involves a &quot;screen.&quot;<br/>
What is he REALLY doing? What is he watching? What is he playing? Try  <br/>
to avoid generalizing about him and his interests.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and had to insist<br/>
&gt; on some sort of quiet time in order to ensure he doesnt hurt anyone<br/>
&gt; with an aggressive outburst.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You didn&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; - you chose to do so.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I chose to insist on a quiet time to insure he wouldn&#39;t hurt anyone  <br/>
with an aggressive outburst.&quot;<br/>
How do you insist on a quiet time? Do you mean you forced him to sit  <br/>
and do/say nothing for a while? Locked him in his room for a while?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Well, since I have been doing so much<br/>

&gt; watch TV when he wants and play VG when he wants.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So - first you limited it and then totally let go of any restrictions  <br/>
all at once?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This also has led<br/>
&gt; us to ditching &quot;quiet time&quot; which has become a source of struggle.<br/>
&gt; So, what happens... he starts hitting, spitting, etc when he finishes<br/>
&gt; watching TV and anything sets him off (doesnt take much).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Describe to us how he &quot;finishes&quot; watching tv. What is he watching? How  <br/>
did he decide what to watch? How does he decide he is finished? Does  <br/>
he decide not to watch more because there is something else he wants  <br/>
to do or ?<br/>
<br/>
Also, how long has it been since you dropped the restrictions?<br/>
When you had restrictions, did you tell him why you had them - so he  <br/>
knows you think tv makes him aggressive?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have<br/>

&gt; out.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Seems like you&#39;re focused on stopping his behavior, but I want to know  <br/>
what he is so angry about.<br/>
<br/>
There are other ways to help him not lash out so much when something  <br/>
&quot;sets him off&quot; - again, though, this description is disrespectful and  <br/>
disempowering.  You completely discounted his actual feelings like  <br/>
they are of no importance at all. Some little things (it doesn&#39;t take  <br/>
much, you said) really really bother him to the point that he gets so  <br/>
frustrated and angry that he hits, kicks, spits. Can you talk about  <br/>
what those little irritants are?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Conventional parents don&#39;t take their children&#39;s inner emotions,  <br/>
feelings, thoughts, personality characteristics, very seriously.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Then the RU part of me feels quilty for<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;ve adopted the &quot;no restrictions&quot; thing but not the attentive  <br/>
parenting part of radical unschooling, maybe?<br/>

I&#39;ve picked at your words a lot - try to take it in the spirit  <br/>
intended - it will REALLY truly help you to be aware of the words  <br/>
you&#39;re using and the way you&#39;re thinking of your child. Improving that  <br/>
will make more difference than anything else, over time.<br/>
<br/>
I have a lot of potential ideas for you, but need a little more  <br/>
explanation of what is exactly going on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1520860093">I don&#39;t know how truly &quot;unschooly&quot; this is (someone please correct me, if it isn&#39;t), but I have noticed that when my son (age6) watches certain shows, his explosiveness seems to increase.  Instead of telling him that I don&#39;t want him watching those shows, I talked to him about how some TV shows make me feel nervous or unsettled or upset when I watch them.  I also talked to him about how I can become grumpy when I stay in one place too long.  It was as if a light-bulb went off in his brain when I tried this approach.  Right away, he told me that _____ show made him feel that way and that he didn&#39;t want to watch it any more.  From that moment on, he chose not to watch that show.  A few months later, though, he said he DID want to watch it to see if it still made him angry.  It no longer effected him that way, so he was ok with watching it again and so was I.  Since then, he has decided (completely on his own) when to stop watching certain programs<br/>
 and has even told his 4 year old brother why he won&#39;t watch those shows with him.  He just lets his brother watch them and finds something else he wants to do.  This has been amazing for me!  I hope this idea might help.<br/>

<br/>
Have you read The Explosive Child by Ross Greene?<br/>
http://tinyurl. com/5bhh5r<br/>
<br/>
Lots of people have said it gave them great insight into their child.<br/>
<br/>
While you&#39;re waiting for it, know that he doesn&#39;t want to be <br/>
aggressive. I think too often we see children doing something they <br/>
shouldn&#39;t and assume 1) they don&#39;t care or 2) they don&#39;t understand.<br/>
<br/>
But the truth is 1) either they&#39;re not ready to understand or 2) it&#39;s <br/>
not important to them yet.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say the first is true. Kids (and adults!) can understand in their <br/>
heads something is true before they&#39;re able to use the knowledge. <br/>
(How many smokers know they should quit?) That&#39;s where he is. The <br/>
more you explain, the more frustrated he&#39;s going to get because <br/>
you&#39;re treating him as though he&#39;s stupid. Trust that he knows but <br/>
the pathways from his head to his body aren&#39;t in place yet.<br/>
<br/>
He wants a way he can watch and play without exploding. Talk to him <br/>
when he&#39;s doing neither and brainstorm some ideas. (And it&#39;s okay if <br/>
he doesn&#39;t know. Some kids don&#39;t.) Rather than focusing on the goal <br/>
of getting him to stop ranting, just ask him &quot;What can I do to help?&quot; <br/>
and be open to new ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Before he goes in to watch or play remind him of what he decided he <br/>
might do instead. *Not* as a plan he must stick with. Don&#39;t set him <br/>
up for failure. It&#39;s just an aid to help him remember to try it.<br/>
<br/>
Also be more present. Notice when he&#39;s ramping up and offer some <br/>
protein snacks. Rather than thinking of this as helping him to stop <br/>
ranting, think of helping him develop a choice of life long <br/>
strategies to deal with frustration.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-395810604">In my previous post, it may have seemed like I implied to him that the TV show was to blame.  That was definitely not the case.  My son is a wonderfully sensitive child who truly FEELS the emotions of the characters on TV.  He worries about every injustice and physical hurt that happens on the screen, even if they are supposed to be funny.  These worries continue throughout the rest of the day.  He may lash out at his brother and then start crying about something that he was sad on the show.  In addition to also discussing how TV makes us feel at times, I have learned that truly being there for him and watching the shows with him has helped me to not only understand what is &quot;causing&quot; his sadness and frustration, but also begin to point out to him how the characters solve their problems.  This has helped him begin to think of new ways to solve any problems he has with his brother.  I, personally, think that TV has been a true blessing for my<br/>
 relationship with my wonderful &quot;explosive&quot; child.  <br/>
 <br/>
Oh!  Being present with him has also shown me how desensitized to others feelings I have become.  (Why doesn&#39;t a cartoon character&#39;s sadness effect me like it used to?)  Anyway, that is another tangent.<br/>

what he is so angry about.<br/>
<br/>
There are other ways to help him not lash out so much when something <br/>
&quot;sets him off&quot; - again, though, this description is disrespectful and <br/>
disempowering. You completely discounted his actual feelings like <br/>
they are of no importance at all. Some little things (it doesn&#39;t take <br/>
much, you said) really really bother him to the point that he gets so <br/>
frustrated and angry that he hits, kicks, spits. Can you talk about <br/>
what those little irritants are?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What&#39;s he doing *while* watching tv? If he&#39;s &quot;just watching&quot; then it <br/>
could be that he needs a way to be more physical. For the longest <br/>
time we had a rotation of &quot;large motor toys&quot; for Mo to play with <br/>
while watching tv - a sit-n-spin, a big ball with a handle (you sit <br/>
on it and bounce), a skateboard - and the living room chairs were <br/>
braced against the walls so she could jump on them.<br/>
<br/>
Oh! for awhile we had an inflatable punching bag - the kind that you <br/>
hit and it falls over and pops back up. We got it when Mo was in <br/>
a &quot;punching&quot; phase and it was really helpful for her to be able to <br/>
bang on something to her heart&#39;s content *while* watching tv.  <br/>
<br/>
Another thought is food, which I see has already been mentioned, but <br/>
I&#39;ll say it again for emphasis - make sure he&#39;s getting snacks, <br/>
especially protein!<br/>
<br/>
The other thing to remember is that Tommy watching tv doesn&#39;t mean <br/>
mommy gets to wander off and do laundry or whatever - treat it just <br/>
like any other &quot;activity&quot;. If you let tv-watching be a source of <br/>
separation, he could be hitting, spitting etc as an attempt to re-<br/>
connect with you. Its not a very *good* strategy, but he doesn&#39;t <br/>
exactly have a lot of tools yet ;) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-396097124">Hi Stacy!<br/>
<br/>
I have a sensitive and spirited 4 1/2 year old girl and a 2 year old <br/>
girl (still nursing).  We also are excited to start this unschooling <br/>
journey!  Once I started to read about radical unschooling and non-<br/>
coercive parenting I also let go of most of the rules (except for <br/>
dangerous things ofcourse) and I did much like you described; <br/>
allowing unlimited tv, computer, following her interests, etc.  And <br/>
she started to lose it, cry, scream, hit, etc just as you described <br/>
too.  Once I let my guard down and trusted her, things got WORSE for <br/>
a while.  And I have heard on other parenting boards as well that any <br/>
time you change your parenting from high limits to no/low limits the <br/>
children will &#39;act out&#39; more to see where the new boundries are, and <br/>
if mommy really does unconditionally love without coercion or if it <br/>
will just go back the way it was.    <br/>
<br/>
I just upheld my personal boundry of &#39;WE dont hit&#39;, &#39;hitting hurts, <br/>
and then give lots and lots of love and attention.  I have found that <br/>
when they are acting out, they usually need lots of love and <br/>
patience.  <br/>
<br/>
TV also can over-stimulate my daughter, and so when there were no <br/>
limits she wanted to test that and watch all day.  I let her and she <br/>
spent much time crying after that.  I talked to her about how she <br/>
feels when she sits all day and not get out to run, and she decided <br/>
she wanted to have time outside to run more.  She is still learning <br/>
her own tv viewing limits, but she is doing so much better now after <br/>
that first week of testing, and watching a lot less naturally.  The <br/>
hitting, whining, crying phase has almost all melted away after a few <br/>
weeks of staying consistent in my gentle parenting.  Just like the <br/>
key in any parenting technique is confidence and consistency, same <br/>
with non-coercive parenting.  <br/>
<br/>
One book that was recommended here was Naomi Aldort&#39;s &quot;Raising Our <br/>
Children, Raising Ourselves&quot;.  She is an unschooling writer as well <br/>
and her book has been so so helpful.<br/>
<br/>
You can also watch her on YouTube- this video (someone here sent it <br/>
to me) and I found it helpful to understand that we are still our <br/>
children&#39;s leader.  <br/>

This sounds ALOT like Tommy. He has undergone SO many emotional <br/>

is hard for him not to be explosive. It would be hard for anyone I <br/>

<br/>
Having healthy snacks offered to him more is a good suggestion that I <br/>
will keep in mind. I tend to forget snacks when we are busy.<br/>

gone through a very similar thing and that your daughter is starting <br/>
to naturally regulate her TV watching. <br/>
<br/>
You have really helped me!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1409676447">Oh! for awhile we had an inflatable punching bag - the kind that you <br/>

We just got back from the store. We bought a blow-up punching bag! He <br/>
loves it. What a great, safe way for a child to get their <br/>
anger/aggression out.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing to remember is that Tommy watching tv doesn&#39;t mean <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; mommy gets to wander off and do laundry or whatever - treat it just <br/>
&gt; like any other &quot;activity&quot;. If you let tv-watching be a source of <br/>

&gt; connect with you. Its not a very *good* strategy, but he doesn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; exactly have a lot of tools yet ;) <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a wonderful point. I do tend to use his tv watching and VG <br/>
playing time as a break or a time to spend one-on-one time with <br/>
Chloe. He is probably feeling disconnected. I will definately attempt <br/>
to be with him more and see if it helps.<br/>

enough to survive is anger but that we were never taught how to express<br/>

emotional and it shows in their face and actions. I always tell them they<br/>

<br/>
In my previous post, it may have seemed like I implied to him that the TV<br/>
show was to blame.  That was definitely not the case.  My son is a<br/>
wonderfully sensitive child who truly FEELS the emotions of the characters<br/>
on TV.  He worries about every injustice and physical hurt that happens on<br/>
the screen, even if they are supposed to be funny.  These worries continue<br/>
throughout the rest of the day.  He may lash out at his brother and then<br/>
start crying about something that he was sad on the show.  In addition to<br/>
also discussing how TV makes us feel at times, I have learned that truly<br/>
being there for him and watching the shows with him has helped me to not<br/>
only understand what is &quot;causing&quot; his sadness and frustration, but also<br/>
begin to point out to him how the characters solve their problems.  This has<br/>
helped him begin to think of new ways to solve any problems he has with his<br/>
brother.  I, personally, think that TV has been a true blessing for my<br/>
relationship with my wonderful &quot;explosive&quot; child.  <br/>
 <br/>
Oh!  Being present with him has also shown me how desensitized to others<br/>
feelings I have become.  (Why doesn&#39;t a cartoon character&#39;s sadness effect<br/>
me like it used to?)  Anyway, that is another tangent.<br/>

what he is so angry about.<br/>
<br/>
There are other ways to help him not lash out so much when something <br/>
&quot;sets him off&quot; - again, though, this description is disrespectful and <br/>
disempowering. You completely discounted his actual feelings like <br/>
they are of no importance at all. Some little things (it doesn&#39;t take <br/>
much, you said) really really bother him to the point that he gets so <br/>
frustrated and angry that he hits, kicks, spits. Can you talk about <br/>
what those little irritants are?<br/>
