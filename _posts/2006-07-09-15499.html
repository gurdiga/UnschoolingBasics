<div id="ygrps-yiv-651388124">I have been basically unschooling up to this point, except a few months of me pushing a little schoolwork with my older son, Sean (age 9).  The pushing (along with traditional parenting methods of time out and such) resulted in a crisis situation where Sean started getting depressed, was violent towards us, and considered himself stupid.  I convinced my husband that we should back off all expectations, academic and otherwise, to give Sean time to heal.  It was just what was needed and Sean is now a happy, much more peaceful person.  We have switched to a peaceful, unconditional parenting approach, which my husband supports.  But he is not supportive of the academic part of unschooling.  I think it&#39;s the label or term that he is most uncomfortable with. Chris is growing concerned because Sean does not write, is very shy and is reluctant to try new things.  I don&#39;t agree with these concerns (they are true, by I don&#39;t see them as concerns), and instead see all the wonderful things Sean knows and does.  It seems like we&#39;re at a crossroads because Chris wants us to push academics more.  He makes all the usual false arguments (I&#39;ve had to do things I don&#39;t like in life, but it&#39;s helped me get where I am... People can&#39;t just do what they want all day long.) and doesn&#39;t agree with my answers.  I&#39;ve asked him to read books and articles, but he says everyone sounds too radical for him.  He seems to prefer research-based data to anecdotes about other children.  Plus, he&#39;s said that even if it&#39;s best for Sean that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s best for Jack (5) because Jack is less resistant to teaching and seems to like hearing * Good job * in tennis lessons and such. Now he&#39;s suggesting that we consider all academic options for the boys based on their individual needs.  I have spent the most time with the boys and have done all the reading on approaches and find unschooling to the best fit for all of us.  Chris wants me to sell it to him.  He asked me to pretend I&#39;m a teacher at a school and should explain why unschooling would be best for each child.  I don&#39;t know where to begin!!  I&#39;ve been telling him all along why it&#39;s best and all the benefits I see in the boys.  The boys are happy and creative, good problem solvers, and know tons of stuff the kids I taught didn&#39;t know. (I previously taught 5th grade in ps)  Does anyone have any suggestions on how to deal with this?? Thanks for any suggestions!<br/>

Hi, Marcella --<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read quite a bit about unschooling, and I don&#39;t think there is<br/>
academic research that proves unschooling works.  (But I encourage<br/>
everyone else reading to correct me if they know of some sources.)<br/>
<br/>
I would recommend Alfie Kohn&#39;s writings as an interesting starting<br/>
point.  He&#39;s got many well-researched and enlightened-sounding<br/>
articles on his website.  (You should be able to google his whole<br/>
name.)  I&#39;ve read some, but not nearly all of them.<br/>
<br/>
I also want to mention a couple of his books.  He wrote one called<br/>
_The Schools Our Children Deserve_.  What this book has is an appendix<br/>
(A?) that summarizes research about learning that fits with what he is<br/>
talking about in his book.  The book AND the research both make the<br/>
point that what&#39;s best for children is individualized learning at<br/>
one&#39;s own speed (and probably not Phonics).  This book is not written<br/>
BY homeschoolers or FOR homeschoolers, but it recommends types of<br/>
learning experiences that are hard to provide in a group setting in a<br/>
classroom but are much easier to provide to individual kids at home.<br/>
<br/>
I have some concerns about using &quot;good job&quot; to get kids to work<br/>
harder.  Some of these concerns are discussed in Kohn&#39;s book _Punished<br/>
by Rewards_ and others in his recent parenting book _Unconditional<br/>
Parenting_.<br/>
<br/>
Kohn is speaking at a Sacramento homeschooling conference in<br/>
mid-August, so after that there should be tapes of his speeches for<br/>
sale online at www.hsc.org   (Look for &quot;conference tapes&quot;.)<br/>
<br/>
I feel it is very important for parenting decisions, including those<br/>
about education, to be mutual.  This is tough if one parent hasn&#39;t or<br/>
won&#39;t do background reading or won&#39;t participate in sustained<br/>
discussions.  But your situation sounds better than that.  Please look<br/>
for opportunities to discuss learning, education, etc. with your<br/>
husband at a time when you both are feeling calm and really have time<br/>
to delve deeply into the topic.  If I was suddenly leaped into your<br/>
shoes (like the TV show Quantum Leap), I&#39;d probably want to get your<br/>
husband talking about his experiences in school.  Maybe even go year<br/>
by year and figure out how much he learned.  (I myself forgot an awful<br/>
lot.)  I think you really have to hear &quot;where he is coming from&quot; and<br/>
what his reservations are in order to marshall your arguments<br/>
successfully.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes wives ask their husbands to trust them for the first year of<br/>
homeschooling and then judge by the results at the end of the year.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also good to make sure that spouses don&#39;t hate their jobs and<br/>
aren&#39;t jealous of how much fun unschooling is for everyone *except*<br/>
them.  Does your husband need you to make his life sweeter somehow?  I<br/>
know he probably got messages growing up that &quot;suffering builds<br/>
character&quot;, but I don&#39;t that&#39;s really true.  Maybe you can convince<br/>
him?  If he is embracing suffering, pour some sweetness and joy on him<br/>
and see if you can convert him to the tap-dancing, yodelling,<br/>
fingerpainting, joy-embracing side of life. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
PS  I also like Frank Smith a lot!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-465882497">My husband has always just gone along because I convinced him to -  <br/>
with the entire radical unschooling lifestyle. He never really has  <br/>
understood it - but the kids seem fine, so he&#39;s fine.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been rereading Alfie Kohn&#39;s book, &quot;Unconditional Parenting,&quot; and  <br/>
left it in the -- you know what&#39;s coming - yes - I left it in the  <br/>
bathroom. I took it out of the bathroom yesterday and last night he  <br/>
was looking for it and said, &quot;That book makes a lot of sense - very  <br/>
interesting and sensible ideas.&quot; WHAT???? Nothing there that I  <br/>
haven&#39;t been telling him for more than a decade.<br/>
<br/>
Alfie is a guy and a dad and it doesn&#39;t hurt that he&#39;s a Harvard  <br/>
professor. He critiques research, but also cites research. I think  <br/>
his logical, not emotional, approach might be just what my dh needed  <br/>
all these years.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1460275872">I am in the same boat concerning a husband who is not on-board. <br/>
Basically, I am in the unschooling lifestyle boat all by myself. The <br/>
grandparents certainly aren&#39;t into it. My husband doesn&#39;t mind too <br/>
much the academic part of the unschooling but has no interest in <br/>
learning about the total unschooling lifestyle. <br/>
<br/>
He refuses to parent in an unschooling way, as do the grandparents, <br/>
who my 3 year old child sees most everyday. HELP! Dh won&#39;t read <br/>
anything on the issue and just tells me &quot;those people are just <br/>
freaks&quot;. Hopefully, over time, he&#39;ll come onboard as he begins to <br/>
understand the hows and the whys more. <br/>
<br/>
I guess there is no advice to give me, but, have others dealt with <br/>
totally resistant hubbies? Any stories to share of how/when your <br/>
hubby finally came on-board to the unschooling lifestyle? <br/>
<br/>
Guess I just need some hope that this will work out, as currently, <br/>
it is causing many waves in our relationship and we can&#39;t continue <br/>
on this way.</div>

terribly earnest as some of us moms can be &lt;G&gt;. (Not that we don&#39;t  <br/>
also like humor - I know we do - but we don&#39;t use it in our talks as  <br/>
much.)<br/>

Passionate he is - but, still, I think he&#39;s appealing more to  <br/>
people&#39;s logic than to trying to get them to just &quot;feel&quot; that this  <br/>
idea of unconditional parenting is right.<br/>

almost grown SUDDENLY my dh starts reading something besides the  <br/>
sports page in the bathroom! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Still - if he won&#39;t read in the bathroom - he might not read a book,  <br/>
anywhere. I had better luck photocopying a page and handing it to him.<br/>

this same uninformation?  Have you brought this logic to his<br/>
attention?  :-D  Sorry, I just don&#39;t believe that someone is allowed<br/>
to criticize something that they haven&#39;t given any time to try to<br/>
understand first.  This was one of my biggest gripes during the whole<br/>
&quot;Tom Cruise Silent Birth&quot; issue many months ago.  People who had done<br/>
no reading about Scientology nor what a silent birth is really all<br/>
about are calling all Scientologists freaks.  But if you ask them if<br/>
they have read anything about Scientology they say, &quot;No way!&quot;<br/>
Mmm-hmmm.  And you are basing your opinion on something you know<br/>
nothing about.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
I hear people go off all the time about such issues as extended<br/>
breastfeeding (or breastfeeding in general), homeschooling,<br/>
attachment/gentle parenting, social issues of all sorts, but when you<br/>
sit and talk to them you realize that they have NO CLUE as to anything<br/>
about any of those subjects and are usually quoting soundbites and<br/>
anecdotal references.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-582417921">Thanks, Besty!<br/>
 <br/>
The point about parenting decisions needing to be mutual was a good <br/>
one.  I am the one with more experience and have put more years into <br/>
reading about homeschooling and unschooling, so I feel like I know <br/>
what is best.  I&#39;m sure that my husband feels that vibe from me and <br/>
feels that I&#39;m not valuing his opinion.  He is starting to read a <br/>
few articles and read a couple chapters of Frank Smith&#39;s *The Book  <br/>
of Learning and Forgetting*, but he reads them defensively- like <br/>
we&#39;re all trying to push some crazy idea - and just finds things to <br/>
argue with.  It seems like we&#39;re in a bit of a power struggle- I&#39;m <br/>
arguing that the kids&#39; should have control over their own education <br/>
and he&#39;s arguing that we need to teach them things.  We watched <br/>
Alfie Kohn&#39;s Unconditional Parenting DVD together and that made a <br/>
lot of sense to him.  He is a supporter of unconditional parenting, <br/>
just not academic unschooling.  I will look for the tapes of Kohn <br/>
after the conference.  <br/>
 <br/>
Revisiting Chris&#39;s school years is also a good idea.  We talked last <br/>
night- after the tension had eased up- about how he dropped his <br/>
typing class in hs because he was getting a *C* and was trying to <br/>
keep his grades up for Valedictorian (which he did get).  We laughed <br/>
about how he didn&#39;t really need that class, since now he types very <br/>
well just from working with computers.  So, if we can get out of <br/>
this power struggle maybe we can have some good dialogue about our <br/>
educational experiences.  Thanks for the suggestions!<br/>
