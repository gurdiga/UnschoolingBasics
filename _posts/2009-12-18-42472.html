<div id="ygrps-yiv-1884896571">Hi Sylvia:<br/>
Expectations are communicated in terms of I statements.  No, there are no emotional consequences that are &quot;set up&quot; but of course, there are feelings that we feel which could be natural consequences.  I feel disappointed when the people I live with don&#39;t care about my feelings and needs as they would feel if I did the same. In being married 20 years, I find that giving 150% in doing things I may not want to for my spouse, but do, because I care about him, helps our relationship, as he does for me.  We communicate our needs and resentment doesn&#39;t build.  I&#39;m just saying that it works for us.<br/>
Warmly,<br/>

What if your husband expected you do something that you did not want to do cause you  had more important things to. He then is really disappointed in you.<br/>
How would that feel?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1520643995">I love my husband. I love my children. Our relationships however aren&#39;t the<br/>
same. My husband and I entered into a relationship with full consent. We are<br/>
both reasonable capable adults with many years of experience between us.<br/>
My children are guests that I invited first into my womb and then into my<br/>
home, thus making it OUR home. It becoming OUR home didn&#39;t also make it<br/>
their responsibility. They are still guests, not house mates.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I feel disappointed when the people I live with don&#39;t care about my<br/>
feelings and needs as they would feel if I did the same.&quot;<br/>
I find this really isn&#39;t a helpful perspective to have with children. I<br/>
think it is really unfair and not age appropriate to equate<br/>
cleaning/cleanliness with respect. My children do not always clean up after<br/>
themselves. And sometimes *I* feel like they don&#39;t love/appreciate/respect<br/>
me because of their neglecting something that is important to me. That<br/>
doesn&#39;t make it truth. My kids love me. They love me when thy leave<br/>
their towels on the floor. The still respect me even when they leave the<br/>
doors open. They still appreciate the cleaning that I GIFT them even when<br/>
they leave their toys/books/etc all over the common area. Their actions, or<br/>
rather inactions, don&#39;t reflect their feelings, only their lack of<br/>
experience or consideration (not towards me but towards cleanliness).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I find that giving 150% in doing things I may not want to for my spouse,<br/>
but do, because I care about him, helps our relationship, as he does for<br/>
me. &quot;<br/>
You are making a choice to do those things, to give those gifts. I feel like<br/>
if I am doing something I otherwise wouldn&#39;t do or don&#39;t care to do, once I<br/>
make a conscious effort to chose to do it, it is NO longer something that I<br/>
don&#39;t want to do. I have switched my perspective to serving myself to<br/>
serving (gifting) another person. I do that because I love my husband and<br/>
children. I don&#39;t do it because I expect anything back from them.<br/>
