<div id="ygrps-yiv-1814892510">Hi fellow unschoolers,<br/>
<br/>
My kids (Nishay,ds7 & Neer,ds1) are visiting my sister who just had a baby boy (Nov 11) in Pittsburgh. We were wondering if there are other unschoolers (or funschoolers, as we call ourselves), in the area that would like to get together for thanksgiving (&/or before/after).<br/>
<br/>
Let me know & we can make further plans.....<br/>
<br/>
hope to meet some cool folks (aka unschoolers) in the area!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1443914409">Just looking for a little boost of encouragement with<br/>
the whole process towards unschooling.  Its bee almost<br/>
6 months now.  Sometimes everything seems to be going<br/>
along just fine......my husband is home with Kora and<br/>
Lukas all day and I go out to work.  We seem to be<br/>
moving along in our adjustment from schooling lives to<br/>
the unschooling life but then everything seems to<br/>
crumble.  My husband feels so overwhelmed with the<br/>
whole thing some days.  Feels like he keeps offering<br/>
activities to do and is met often with what he<br/>
interprets as a lack of interest.  Last night he said<br/>
he was not sure if this is working and maybe he isn&#39;t<br/>
cut out to be an unschooling dad.  I suggested<br/>
connecting to other dads who unschool.  So, I thought<br/>
I would check to see if anyone has some contacts for<br/>
him.  We are still committed but feel a little lost at<br/>
the moment.....<br/>

Thanks Donna and Brian<br/>

 <br/>
Or moms.....see if he would subscribe to this list.  It is geared  toward the <br/>
new unschooler, have him bring his questions here and just sit and  relax and <br/>
read and talk with the group here.  Instead of worrying about the  kids not <br/>
participating in the activities he is offering he could be reading  here, or <br/>
talking with the kids to see what they are interested in and want to  do.  <br/>
 <br/>
I think there are a couple of guys on the list, at least there used to  <br/>
be....I think I have the right list in my head, LOL.  Does he have any  connections <br/>
locally.  I know in places it is hard to find a group that is  open to <br/>
unschoolers, but it can be done...Even connecting with one other  unschooling family <br/>
can be a big help.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-320515118">Hubby is the at home parent. One suggestion would be rather than him<br/>
suggesting is for him to (a) get involved in what the kids are doing<br/>
(even if it&#39;s just sitting and reading a magazine and admiring artworks<br/>
when presented with them) (b) get his own life - what does he love to<br/>
do? Woodworking? Carpentry? Gardening? Oil painting? My hubby plays<br/>
videogames (with or without DS, who is 9), cooks awesome meals (most<br/>
everything we eat is from scratch and he&#39;s looking into canning foods<br/>
next year and grinding our own flour and nut butters), took a community<br/>
college class in computer game design just for fun, and is currently<br/>
very into making wallets and tote bags and such from duct tape (with an<br/>
eye toward selling the items he makes at a town craft fair next July<br/>
4th). He and DS also have spent time exploring local nature trails over<br/>
the last 6 months or so. Sometimes they just pack a lunch and go watch<br/>
airplanes at the major airport 25 minutes from here. BUT the key thing<br/>
is to just go with the flow, not take &quot;no thanks&quot; personally but just as<br/>
a statement of fact - right now, that is not what they want to do. What<br/>
does he do to refill his own tank? <br/>
 <br/>
Also, how does he feel about being the at home dad? Is this something he<br/>
chose? Or, is it something that is a &#39;default&#39; because he got laid off?<br/>
KWIM? If it&#39;s a default thing, he may still be dealing with issues<br/>
related to self image - particularly if he grew up with &quot;Dad works, Mom<br/>
stays home, the man is the breadwinner&quot; type paradigm. We&#39;re fortunate<br/>
in that DH&#39;s growing up years developed a very pragmatic streak in him -<br/>
whatever works, works. <br/>
 <br/>
Y&#39;all can contact me offline and I&#39;ll see if DH wants to hook up via<br/>
email. Also, there is a dad&#39;s group around but I&#39;m not sure how active<br/>
it is.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s been a really, really long time, and I can&#39;t remember.<br/>
<br/>
I hope some of you are documenting your own progress---in a blog or <br/>
journal or whatever---so that others can benefit from your journey! &lt;G&gt; <br/>
I wish I had!<br/>
<br/>
Ren&#39;s trip to unschooling was documented pretty well on the old <br/>
unschooling.com boards.<br/>
<br/>
I remember being GLUED to my computer for a while---reading <br/>
*constantly* at .com. I remember being a bit worried when all Cameron <br/>
would do was watch TV, talk on the phone, IM friends, eat, and sleep. <br/>
He also refused to do anything fun with me and his brother. And I <br/>
remember it got worse (a LOT worse) before it got better. But I&#39;m <br/>
really off on the timing. I&#39;m sorry.<br/>
<br/>
Our deschooling lasted about 18 months. I could have shortened it if I <br/>
had quit worrying and nagging him so much. Yeah---it maybe could have <br/>
been at the 6-8 month range that I panicked. THings just didn&#39;t seem to <br/>
be getting better. He had no interests, and he thought he was stupid. <br/>
Ben wanted him to be doing *something* recordable.<br/>
<br/>
What I remember was that Ben finally read Mary Griffith&#39;s _The <br/>
Unschooling Handboook_ while he was out of town one week. He called me <br/>
and said that *he* understood unschooling and that I should quit trying <br/>
to get Cam to *do* anything. I was only asking him to produce something <br/>
&quot;schoolish&quot; to satisfy Ben. Ben&#39;s &quot;announcement&quot; released me from <br/>
having to have &quot;proof&quot; of any kind. I was relieved. I think *that* was <br/>
the turning point. I didn&#39;t feel the pressure, and maybe Cam felt <br/>
that---I don&#39;t know. But all the pieces seemed to fall into place right <br/>
after that.<br/>
<br/>
Certainly could have been something else! &lt;BG&gt; But looking back, I <br/>
think that Ben somehow gave me &quot;permission&quot; to stop worrying. Something <br/>
in Mary&#39;s book clicked with him, and I suddenly started seeing <br/>
everything as &quot;educational.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I really wish I could remember the timeline!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-530793423">I just saw The Business of Being Born, the film produced by Ricki Lake<br/>
about the birth industry and midwifery,<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://thebusinessofbeingborn.com/)">http://thebusinessofbeingborn.com/)</a> so I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about<br/>
my own two homebirths. I remember one empowering thing I learned about<br/>
birth... transition is the most difficult time, the time when most<br/>
moms want to give up, want to give in and have an epidural, feel like<br/>
there&#39;s NO WAY they can do this. But transition means you&#39;re almost at<br/>
the end! You&#39;re about to do this miraculous thing called giving birth,<br/>
and a whole new life is about to become visible to you. So, if you<br/>
have support around you, draw upon it, and commit to continue on until<br/>
you&#39;re through it. I&#39;ve learned to apply that thought to so many areas<br/>
of my life! Many, many times I&#39;m learning something or growing in some<br/>
way, and I&#39;ll reach a point where I think There&#39;s NO WAY I can do<br/>
this! This is hard! and I&#39;ll think I&#39;m against a wall... then I<br/>
remember... ah, transition! And I&#39;ll draw upon the support around me,<br/>
and commit to continuing on until ah-ha! A whole new aspect of life,<br/>
visible before me.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe 6-8 months is a typical transition time for deschooling<br/>
families? I honestly don&#39;t remember, either. BUT, I know if you commit<br/>
to continue, commit to honor your child&#39;s path, even if it looks<br/>
*nothing* like you thought it would, you&#39;ll break through, and there<br/>
it will be, this whole new life, right in front of you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-975657064">Wow all the input and encouragement is so wonderful.  I have been down with a flu bug these last few days so I am just logging on again reading some wonderful messages.  To answer some questions.  Brian is a writer and has always been at home.  He did the at home dad thing when the kids were small then enjoyed some writing time when they started school now he finds he is at home again with the kids and is trying to figure out how to write and hasn&#39;t figured it out yet.  Kora is 10 and Lukas is 9.  I read about Cameron and his experience has echoed our 6 month experience.  Sort of feeling like we are failing at unschooling.....the old schooling language I know......but it is a real feeling.  It helps to know that other parents have felt the same worries....where it seems kids have no interests, they stay away from so many activities they used to do.  Brian offers a number of ways to engage in learning but they turn the other way.  However, since I wrote about our<br/>
 discouragement, we have let go a little more and see some signs of good things.  Mostly, I see happy, calm and thoughtful children emerging.  When schooled friends come over they are able to engage in lots of creative play while their friends decompress from their day by running wild and excluding each other.  Kora and Lukas seem so far from this now.  I also hear such independence from them...stating clearly what they want to do and what they don&#39;t want to do.  I see them expressing feelings more openly.  Perhaps all the work they are doing and we are doing is more the inner work the things we can&#39;t see.  I better stop here...but thanks for responses and encouragement.  <br/>

and said that *he* understood unschooling and that I should quit trying <br/>
to get Cam to *do* anything. I was only asking him to produce something <br/>
&quot;schoolish&quot; to satisfy Ben. Ben&#39;s &quot;announcement&quot; released me from <br/>
having to have &quot;proof&quot; of any kind. I was relieved. I think *that* was <br/>
the turning point. I didn&#39;t feel the pressure, and maybe Cam felt <br/>
that---I don&#39;t know. But all the pieces seemed to fall into place right <br/>
after that.<br/>
<br/>
Certainly could have been something else! &lt;BG&gt; But looking back, I <br/>
think that Ben somehow gave me &quot;permission&quot; to stop worrying. Something <br/>
in Mary&#39;s book clicked with him, and I suddenly started seeing <br/>
everything as &quot;educational.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I really wish I could remember the timeline!<br/>
