 <br/>
The average high school student&#39;s college application looks like this: <br/>
 <br/>
SAT<br/>
possible ACT<br/>
maybe CLEPs<br/>
three references from teachers<br/>
grades/GPA/rank in class<br/>
the actual application<br/>
an essay<br/>
possibly an interview---more likely at a small school, less likely at a large state university<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
If Cameron were to apply to college, he would submit a portfolio of what he&#39;s been up these last few years (recorded music, art pieces, written work, films). We would meet with the Dean of the college he was applying to. We would request an interview---or three. We would have reference letters from other artists he&#39;s worked with---either musically or magically or visually (and some of those are some mighty BIG names in their fields (Skip Pearson, Jeff McBride, Alan Nu, Christian Thee). We would have letters from band members, employers, and professors whose classes he&#39;s sat in on. He&#39;s travelled extensively: we&#39;d include all that. We&#39;d list his volunteer work in the community. Ben would help him with more of a resume-style application, showing what&#39;s he&#39;s accomplished.<br/>
 <br/>
We would NOT submit a diploma or grades or GPA. He *might* be talked into taking the SAT. but I bet he would talk them OUT of it! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
If you&#39;re looking at 500 regular schooled applications and ONE unusual one, which one sticks out???<br/>
 <br/>
We *could* chose to have his application look like every other one, but that wouldn&#39;t get him noticed. BE different! Unlike highschools, colleges LOVE diversity! Make him stand out!<br/>
<br/>
Colleges are recruiting unschoolers now. Unschoolers are overwhelmingly admired by professors who are damned tired of looking at bored, disinterested faces of kids who are in college because that&#39;s the next step or because that&#39;s just what&#39;s expected of them or because they have nothing else to do and have no direction in their lives. UNSCHOOLERS, on the other hand are there by choice---because there&#39;s something to pursue. They&#39;re bright and energetic students whose love of learning has not been lost. In fact, they&#39;ve become so wrapped up in what their passions are, they&#39;ve chosen college to further that knowledge. That makes them great students, whom professors LOVE!<br/>
 <br/>
I would just let your 13 year old pursue passions to the nth degree. His portfolio will speak for itself!<br/>

  My daughter just turned 18 and plans to attend our state&#39;s university this fall.  In this state it is pretty much about her ACT score.  We bought a computer disc and she took an intial practice test so we could just see where we were with it.  Her score is already high enough to get into college.  She wants to do some of the lessons on the disc to get it up a bit more and we need to go over some math symbols.  Her composite score was really good, but her math on its on was kindof low.  ONce we do that and I show her a few calculator trick she&#39;ll be fine.  She has been unschooled since about 6th grade, we were relaxed home schoolers since 4th grade.<br/>
  We went to a lot of trouble to prepare a port folio with my older daughter, they didn&#39;t give it a glance, just looked at the test score and admitted her.  I&#39;m sure it varies with different schools in different states.  Basically my kids just &#39;learn that test&#39;, take it and go on with their plans.  <br/>
  18 year old is going so she can get involved with the theater department.  I think she will have a great time with it.  Even if she doesn&#39;t bring up the partcular math score, they will still admit her, she will just take an easier math class and work her way up until she fullfills their requirement.  She is thinking she may do that anyway, just so it&#39;s easier.<br/>

You&#39;re welcome.<br/>
 <br/>
But don&#39;t worry. Cameron had 18 months of doing nothing but eat, sleep, watch tv, talk on the phone, <br/>
and IM with friends before he even started showing the least bit of interest in anything else. It <br/>
started slowly until now he just doesn&#39;t have enough hours in the day or days in the week to get <br/>
everything he wants to do done. Reminder---he came out of school at 12 too.<br/>
 <br/>
But he didn&#39;t jump out of the box like that! It was ssss---llll---oooo---wwwww going! I was as patient as I <br/>
could be (struggling the whole while!). I listened to the experienced unschoolers and kept my mouth shut <br/>
as much as I could----my tongue was a mass of teeth marks! &lt;g&gt; I offered and accepted no as an answer to <br/>
most (almost ALL!) of my suggestions. But he came out of that murky darkness and gradually did more and <br/>
more every month. <br/>
 <br/>
He&#39;s a radical unschooler now! &lt;g&gt; He even read Rue&#39;s book! &lt;bwg&gt; First one EVER cover to cover all by <br/>
himself! WooHOO!<br/>
 <br/>
Be patient. It&#39;s tough. But you can do it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1711393368">Kelly:  you are so encouraging.  We have deschooling since  April, my <br/>
dd is 11.  She doesn&#39;t want to do anything that remotely looks <br/>

loves her computer, PS2 games and TV.<br/>
<br/>
She hated school by the time I pulled her out in the middle of 4th <br/>
grade.  But I did buy some puzzle books from Mindware and she started <br/>
getting into them last night while I was asleep.  I put them on the <br/>
coffee table and she must have found them because they all over the <br/>

It helps so much to hear of kids who came out of school like my dd.  <br/>
While I wish we had lived this way from the beginning, we can&#39;t <br/>
change that and I&#39;m grateful to have found unschooling.  (Let me <br/>
add:  Sleeping until 1PM, eating, listening to the radio while on <br/>
the computer, talking with her one good friend (not an <br/>
unschooler/homeschooler, lives 25 mins away), watching TV, movies, <br/>
IMing friends (and most lately ME, she likes to be able to &quot;talk&quot; to <br/>
me about things she&#39;s too uncomfortable to say in person on AIM).<br/>

I hold on to these images and try to have faith that she will find <br/>

it&#39;s MY OWN insecurity, which is why I have you guys!)<br/>
