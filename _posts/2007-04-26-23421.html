<div id="ygrps-yiv-333478896">I just want to announce that the Early Bird Deadline is looming. April <br/>
30 is the last day for the discount. And unlike it years past, when <br/>
I&#39;ve fudged a day or two or waited on mail sent on the deadline (or <br/>
just after), this year it&#39;s all automated. On May 1st, the price goes <br/>
up.<br/>
<br/>
PLEASE register before it&#39;s pricier! You don&#39;t have to pay for meals or <br/>
lodging---just registration by this date. You may pay for lodging next <br/>
month and the meal plans two months later. As long as it&#39;s all paid for <br/>
by July 31, we&#39;re good.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll be working like crazy to update the website this week and next <br/>
week. There will be lots of new stuff announced and rearranged, so stop <br/>
by often! And remember, this conference is what *you* make it! If <br/>
there&#39;s something you&#39;d like to see there, offer it; we&#39;ll try to make <br/>
it happen!<br/>
<br/>
And don&#39;t forget to register!!!<br/>
