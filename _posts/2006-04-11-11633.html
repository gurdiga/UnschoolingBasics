<br/>
I have never ever heard anyone here say that on this list, ever... though I<br/>
believe that it is expected that you come here with an open mind and heart<br/>
to begin to release coercive control over our children and begin to respect<br/>
and trust them as equal human beings (who need guidance, not to be<br/>
controlled).<br/>
<br/>
What is not welcome is discussion about curriculum (obviously).<br/>

I would not find it encouraging <br/>
to be told &quot;You&#39;re not X or Y enough for this list.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I am genuinely bewildered, which may make me come across <br/>
belligerent. Would somebody help me out?<br/>
