<div id="ygrps-yiv-2076901394">Hi Alyce,<br/>
That is one of my major mood lifter tricks !!  When ever I feel myself or <br/>
the kids getting cranky or bored, I turn the music way up. Singing at the <br/>
top of your lungs & dancing like a fool works wonders !!<br/>
<br/>
And you also don&#39;t have to be cranky for it to be fun too :)<br/>

&quot;......Have you tried blasting music and jumping up and down together?<br/>
That&#39;s a fun family activity.  Leads to lots of giggles and silliness<br/>
together. lol.  You can&#39;t help but be in a good mood after that!  (In<br/>
fact, it&#39;s gotten to the point here that if I&#39;m getting a little<br/>
grumpy, one of the kids will put on a &quot;jumping around&quot; song knowing it<br/>
will work some magic and make our day go better.)<br/>

just one of those things we do.  lol.  ~Alyce</div>
