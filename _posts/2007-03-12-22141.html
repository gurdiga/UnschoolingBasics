<div id="ygrps-yiv-1945804607">I&#39;m not sure it was here, but I know someone posted some links to sites <br/>
about the misinformation etc about meds for ADD and <br/>
other &quot;disabilities&quot;.  I thought I had saved them but can&#39;t find them.  <br/>
My dd was diagnosed 5 yrs ago when she was still in school, but I never <br/>
felt comfortable with it (which pushed me to research further about <br/>
homeschooling, then I found unschooling, etc etc.....!).   I want to <br/>
share this type of info with someone who recently got a diagnosis of <br/>
ADD for their child (they&#39;re currently homeschooling, not unschoolers, <br/>
not sure why they pursued this), who knows very little about all of <br/>
this, I want to help her before she&#39;s &quot;brainwashed&quot; into thinking meds <br/>
will help her child be &quot;normal&quot;, ICK!<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

I have one word your friend: Feingold !!  (www.feingold.org and the Yahoo<br/>
group FeingoldProgram_4us).<br/>
 <br/>
This is a dietary program that eliminates four main aritificials and,<br/>
initially, fruits and vegetables which are high in salycilates.  Going casin<br/>
free (milk products) (and sometimes gluten free) is also often a big help.<br/>
This diet (which includes restricting skin-care products and cleaning<br/>
products) is quite effective for a *much* higher percentage of those with<br/>
ADHD than believed within the mainstream medical establishment.  I have seen<br/>
the huge percentage of skeptical newbies (including yours truly) join the<br/>
program/group and then post back about the improvements they witness.  For<br/>
those who follow the program strictly, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the<br/>
success rate is over 90%.  My friend was about to put her son on Ritalin for<br/>
the first time when I told her about the program.  She joined, and she and<br/>
her son&#39;s teacher both have seen significant improvements.  The<br/>
pressure/temptation to medicate is gone for them now.<br/>
 <br/>
Also, she should consider finding a good DAN! doctor (Defeat Autism Now) and<br/>
joining the Yahoo group ADHD_DrugFree.  You see, ADHD (when it is the real<br/>
thing) is considered to be part of a group of disorders called Autism<br/>
Spectrum Disorders (ASD).  These include bipolar, Turette&#39;s, and Aspergers,<br/>
among others.  In fact, the symptoms of real ADHD and autism often overlap<br/>
to the degree that autism is sometimes initially misdiagnosed as ADHD (and<br/>
possibly vice versa).  In a way, ADHD is considered to be the highest<br/>
functioning form of autism.  In recent years, huge strides have been made in<br/>
treating autism through diet (uncovering food sensitivities), especially<br/>
casin free and gluten free.  DAN! doctors take a biomedical/nutritional<br/>
approach to autism and ADHD.  They run blood tests and urine tests to help<br/>
guide nutritional recommendations rather than handing out meds after an<br/>
initial 15 minute appointment.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Hi everyone,<br/>
  I just wanted to suggest that the above information might be somewhat inaccurate.  Per the DSM-IV-TR, all of the disorders mentioned above are part of the Axis I group of disorders.  Asperger&#39;s Disorder in the only diagnosis that falls into the category of Pervasive Development Disorders.  Tourette&#39;s Disorder falls into the category of Tic Disorders, and ADHD falls into a specific category of Attention-deficit and Disruptive Behaviour Disorders (labels are so disquieting).  The broader labels (PDD, Tic, Attention-deficit) all fall under a specific classification of childhood disorders (Disorders Usually First Diagnosed In Infancy, Childhood, or Adolescence).  On the flip side, Bipolar falls into a category of Bipolar Disorders, and  there are a few.<br/>
