<div id="ygrps-yiv-1089442119">Isn&#39;t it funny how changing things up really brings everyone together.  My sons love rearranging things in the house!  I find that I need to do this for them a couple of times each month.  My sister does it weekly because they are at home about 90% of the time.  When my house is a total mess, I usually get things going by reorganizing a closet or room.  This gets everyone&#39;s energy going and I get some extra help : )<br/>

The boys are switching rooms in anticipation of the baby, (my oldest<br/>
asked for the smaller room so &quot;baby stuff&quot; didn&#39;t go in his room, oh<br/>
and IF we painted it red and he could sleep in the closet!)  Anyway...<br/>
while cleaning the rooms I had bought some giant bins at BigLots for<br/>
toys because the stairs are becoming a problem for me.  Up and down up<br/>
and down!  Plus when the baby comes I&#39;d rather sit at the table with<br/>
them, then on their floors.  Now their toys are organized and in bins<br/>
in the dining room.  Including a half a ton of Lego&#39;s.  But guess<br/>
what?  They are playing together, more often, and I&#39;ve even gotten in<br/>
on the building.  They love it.  They&#39;ve been playing Lego&#39;s,<br/>
Heroscape, and duplo blocks for days now.  I also organized a big<br/>
game/art shelf and suddenly they are enjoying each other&#39;s company<br/>
more often on that too. <br/>
<br/>
Also, I found when my kids got their OWN rooms, they started fighting<br/>
MORE.  This is when possessiveness actually took over.  I heard a lot<br/>
of &quot;It&#39;s my room!  Get out!&quot;  There were LOTS of hurt feelings.  My<br/>
point is that having the &quot;community area&quot; of toys downstairs in the<br/>
middle of &quot;life&quot; has been a wonderful solution for us. <br/>
