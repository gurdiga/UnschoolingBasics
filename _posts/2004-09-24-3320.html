<div id="ygrps-yiv-1429379315">Hi,<br/>
 I only have a minute because we are getting the house tidied yp but this<br/>
seems to be a constant issue.<br/>
  Our oldest at home child is 16 (Zach a boy) and he is pretty good with the<br/>
two younger ones 9&7. <br/>
 this morning I heard a squabble going on and before i could intervene the 9<br/>
yo (Jacob a boy) was very angry. Zach had pushed him off of him and<br/>
accidently scratched him. Both boys are angry feeling like the other did it<br/>
purposely. I don&#39;t want to take sides...I&#39;ve tried talking to them alone and<br/>
asking if there was anything they could do diferently etc. But it still goes<br/>
on.Any ideas?<br/>
  I end up telling Zach that he needs to keep his hands off of the young<br/>
ones but that isn&#39;t fair because Jacob gets rough sometimes. Plus he feels<br/>
really bad that I am upset. He is one of my out of sync kids. Jacob is his<br/>
own person and isn&#39;t nearly as overwhelmed by situations.<br/>
thanks for any ideas<br/>
