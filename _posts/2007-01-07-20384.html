Lets say you are with your kids at your friends house and your child <br/>
asks you if he can (for example) have some candy.<br/>

Which is why hypotheticals make for lousy discussions. While we can  <br/>
make up reasonable explanations for the actions someone has made up,  <br/>
the real solution lies in why something is happening rather than what  <br/>
is happening.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-445365356">I was asking because I wanted to know what someone would do in that <br/>
situation. Because I would feel uncomfortable and not know what to <br/>
say.<br/>
<br/>
So I wanted others opinions. I never said whose candy it was, and <br/>
maybe I DO walk around with candy in my purse. Nothing wrong with <br/>
that.<br/>

Sorry if I offended you.<br/>

Just looking for advice...<br/>

**Exactly. Only it&#39;s usually candy I like -- mints, in my case. The kids have pockets for whatever they want -- usually. Unless they need to stuff something into my purse, which they are welcome to do. All this fuss over who gets to control the treats and I can&#39;t even find a pen in my purse half the time. ..  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1967784839">My daughter is 7yrs.old. She loves being unschooled but it somewhat <br/>
worries me that she never wants to do extracirrcular activities. She <br/>
takes dance but even though she loves it when she gets there, she never <br/>
wants to go. Should I make her? We have already paid for her costumes. <br/>
I&#39;ve suggested of other activities also music,gymnasitics,sports etc. <br/>
but no luck. She is very social when she is around others and children <br/>
seem to like her very much.She is alone so much and I think thats okay <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-537114279">Hi Staci,<br/>
<br/>
I have a son that often digs his heels in about going places (events <br/>
he&#39;s wanted to go, parties, classes, team sports, etc etc!!), too. <br/>
I&#39;ve gone over this time and time again. In my own head, with him, <br/>
with my husband, friends, therapists and this is what I&#39;ve decided.<br/>
I would be at a loss. Going over it in my head, trying to be mindful <br/>
of him.. I&#39;m sure you know what I mean. <br/>
<br/>
Many times he&#39;ll thank us for taking him to the event after he&#39;s dug <br/>
his heels in so deep not to go! <br/>
<br/>
My conclusion is that Yes, I will have to *make* him go sometimes. <br/>
(He&#39;s old enough to stay alone) We&#39;ve also found out that what he&#39;s <br/>
feeling is anxiety. Transitions can be hard. <br/>
<br/>
I think you should talk to your daughter. Ask her about what makes her <br/>
not want to go. Does she *really* like dancing? Ask for her input on <br/>
what you should do when she starts to get tense and say she doesn&#39;t <br/>
want to go. She may have ideas for you! I&#39;d also de-brief after. Go <br/>
over what happened and review how happy she seems *after* and could <br/>
she try to remember that when she says she doesn&#39;t want to go.<br/>
<br/>
I do this *all the time* with my son. It doesn&#39;t always seem to help <br/>
but he&#39;s only getting better. Itty bitty teensy weensy baby steps at a <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps,<br/>
Warm regards,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1772786458">Staci-<br/>
<br/>
Why does it worry you that she does not want to do certain activities? What is it that you <br/>
are worrying about? Socialization? Motivation? Schedule? Exposure? Does your daughter <br/>
share your concern or is she content with her current situation? If she is happy and is not <br/>
asking for more stimulation, then could that indicate that it is your own need and not hers <br/>
that is at play? <br/>
<br/>
It caught my eye that you used the word &quot;extracurricular.&quot; If I am willing to trust my child <br/>
to learn without a curriculum-- then it makes sense to me that I should extend that trust <br/>
to anything &quot;extracurricular&quot;, too.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; even though she loves it when she gets there, she never <br/>
&gt; wants to go.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Kids are so great at living in the moment. They can get caught up in the *now* and it <br/>
makes it more challenging for them to leave their current situation to move on to another. <br/>
If she wants to take ballet, but has trouble with the transitioning, then you two can discuss <br/>
ways to make the transition smoother for her.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&quot;Should I make her?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This question raises several concerns for me. First, I am wary of any sentence that starts <br/>
with *should.* &quot;Should&quot; is often an arbitrary, cultural expectation that falls to pieces upon <br/>
a thorough examination. Secondly, why would you &quot;make&quot; anyone do anything? I don&#39;t find <br/>
value in things that other people force upon me. <br/>
<br/>
My daughter took ballet when she was 5. We paid quite a bit for the class, costumes, <br/>
shoes, pictures etc. After awhile she stopped wanting to go, even though she did still  <br/>
have fun when she chose to go. She explained to me that she loved ballet, but the dances <br/>
they did were not graceful or beautiful, It bothered her that they had to dance to songs <br/>
like &quot;Teddy Bear&#39;s Picnic&quot; and &quot;Row, Row, Row Your Boat.&quot; For her ballet was dramatic, <br/>
classical music and graceful movements. Eventually she asked if she could stop going. She <br/>
still dances at home everyday. She loves it- but I often think that if we had &quot;made&quot; her <br/>
finish out her ballet classes, then she might have lost that joy. I wonder if I had prioritized <br/>
the money and made her continue to &quot;get my money&#39;s worth&quot; what she would have felt <br/>
about ballet? How much would that have damaged our relationship? <br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps...<br/>

<br/>
Arizona is a GREAT place to unschool.<br/>
Here is a link from our homeschool website about Arizona regulations.<br/>
Basically, you let the school superintendent know you<br/>
will be homeschooling by filling out an affadavit & that is it!<br/>

Where in Arizona will you be?<br/>
You might also be interested in HENA.  It is a state-wide homeschool<br/>
association with links to homeschool groups around the state.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hena.us/">http://www.hena.us/</a>  They just put on their first weekend conference.  It<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-901051647">I am rather new to all of the concepts of radical unschooling. I have pretty much been very laid back about teaching my kids and amazingly they pick up stuff as they go along and show tons of interest in all kinds of cool stuff.<br/>
I have never had a problem with letting my kids do things in their own time, I let them wean when they are ready, cosleep until they are ready to sleep alone, potty train when they are ready etc..well this is where my problem comes in. My 1st child potty trained at 2, my 2nd child at 2 1/2, my 3rd kid was a very easy going guy and was in no hurry to potty train and did not potty train until he was over 4 years old..I thought that was quite old to potty train but I let him wait until he was ready and when he was ready one day he just said he did not want diapers anymore and that was that.<br/>
Well..my 4th kid is 5 years and 3 months old and REFUSES to potty train. He will NOT do it. He knows how..he knows exactly when he needs to go but just refuses to go in the toilet. I have tried all kinds of stuff including not mentoning it at all...but...how far should I go with letting him do this at his own time? What should I do?? just leave it as a non issue and let him figure it out??<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1370844647">I would work really hard on figuring out WHY he won&#39;t use the toilet.  <br/>
My daughter was nearly five, and the reason (I finally figured) was  <br/>
that the noise was really more than her sensory system could handle.  <br/>
Not only was there the flush, but every thing from the urine hitting  <br/>
the water, to the drain that happened to kick in sometimes while  <br/>
you&#39;re sitting there, was just overwhelming, especially in a tile  <br/>
bathroom that echoed the sounds. We started by putting down carpet  <br/>
and putting lots of towel racks in the wall (the hanging towels  <br/>
muffle sounds, I just couldn&#39;t bring myself to hang rugs in the  <br/>
bathroom!) When that still didn&#39;t work, we bought a camping potty  <br/>
(basically a five gallon bucket deal, with a seat that fit on the  <br/>
top) She was able to use that, and that was much better than 1)  <br/>
changing pull ups on a five year old and 2) finding piles and puddles  <br/>
around the house. :-)<br/>
As time passed, she was better able to deal with the noise, and she  <br/>
slowly transitioned from the potty to the toilet. It helped that we  <br/>
were having her dump the bucket after a while. It was easier for her  <br/>
to do that, than it was to go directly, because there was a lot more  <br/>
control on her part, she wasn&#39;t vulnerable and unable to escape. If  <br/>
that makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the short side of that story is to figure out why and then  <br/>
make your plans from there. He&#39;ll do it in his own time anyway, if  <br/>
there&#39;s anything I&#39;ve figured out by now is that eating and pooping  <br/>
are two things you really can&#39;t do much to help with. You can  <br/>
facilitate, you can make it easier for him to choose that, but it has  <br/>
to come in his own time.<br/>

I have no advice for you &lt;g&gt; my ds turned 5 in June (4th child) and <br/>
he poops in a diaper. I really don&#39;t know why either, he just says <br/>
he&#39;s not old enough to poop in the toilet, which is funny because he <br/>
knows other 5 yr olds and they use the toilet. He has peed in the pot <br/>
since he was 2 no accidents in that department. Maybe it&#39;s his last <br/>
thing of babyhood left, I&#39;m not sure but I do know that I will NOT <br/>
force him. I believe that he will go when he is ready, it&#39;s kind of <br/>
odd but I was just asking other unschoolers if they had experience <br/>
with this. I&#39;m looking forward to the responses here. But I believe <br/>
the bottom line is he will do it when he is ready just like <br/>
everything else.<br/>

acidents. I have taken him to Dr&#39;s about this and he is a bed  wetter and has <br/>
some accidents with urinating his pants during the day. They have  him on <br/>
medication for that but can not give me an explanation for the bowel  movement <br/>
problem. All I can tell you is have patience. The Dr told me  sometimes children <br/>
just are having difficulty with doing it but they assure me  when he is ready <br/>
he will do it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1767268679">There has yet to be a healthy adult in diapers.  It<br/>
took my first son a long time as well and a friend of<br/>
his went even longer, at least to 5.6 y.o. Yes, he<br/>
will do it in his own time when he is ready. Maybe<br/>
offer that he can go diaperless and  that you would<br/>
put one on him if he needs it to go in it.  This way<br/>
he would not have to walk around in them all day but<br/>
they are there when he wants them to. This is how I<br/>
did it with my oldest, until one day we were out and<br/>
for some reason I did not have another diaper and I<br/>
asked him if he could just go in the toilet this one<br/>
time, he did it no problem and after he realized that<br/>
it was not so hard as he had imagined he was ready to<br/>
go without completely.<br/>

&gt; *******Hi Shannon,<br/>
&gt; I have no advice for you &lt;g&gt; my ds turned 5 in June<br/>
&gt; (4th child) and <br/>
&gt; he poops in a diaper. I really don&#39;t know why<br/>
&gt; either, he just says <br/>
&gt; he&#39;s not old enough to poop in the toilet, which is<br/>
&gt; funny because he <br/>
&gt; knows other 5 yr olds and they use the toilet. He<br/>
&gt; has peed in the pot <br/>
&gt; since he was 2 no accidents in that department.<br/>
&gt; Maybe it&#39;s his last <br/>
&gt; thing of babyhood left, I&#39;m not sure but I do know<br/>
&gt; that I will NOT <br/>
&gt; force him. I believe that he will go when he is<br/>
&gt; ready, it&#39;s kind of <br/>
&gt; odd but I was just asking other unschoolers if they<br/>
&gt; had experience <br/>
&gt; with this. I&#39;m looking forward to the responses<br/>
&gt; here. But I believe <br/>
&gt; the bottom line is he will do it when he is ready<br/>
&gt; just like <br/>
&gt; everything else.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1003785801">Hi all you very patient mommys, (I so wish I had been unschooling when <br/>
mine was that young, oh to do it all over).. any way, I am wondering if <br/>
maybe you could make the toilet a fun thing? Sounds crazy but maybe if <br/>
you talked about &#39;where&#39; the poop goes or researched some pictures of a <br/>
sewer system or looked at some books on how septic tanks work?  Might <br/>
be a bit advanced for the little ones but if it makes the whole <br/>
experience less scary and more interesting...maybe try putting <br/>
different flushable items in the toilet together, watch it go down and <br/>
talk about..hmm where is is going?  It&#39;s sounding really crazy now, but <br/>
ya never know?<br/>
hang in there, in good time :o)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it is harder for boys to get this concept when they pee <br/>
standing up it is hard to transition to pooping where it is a sit down <br/>
thing. Girls are already sitting so they go when they go. Just wanted <br/>
to make sure they &quot;knew&quot; they could pee sitting down when they also <br/>
felt the urge to poop.<br/>
<br/>
Also if you watch children they squat and poop which is a whole <br/>
differnt postition than sitting on the toliet. I think that is why kids <br/>
poop when playing because they are squatting not sitting. I am not sure <br/>
how to remedy this but I think toliets are designed all wrong because <br/>
we are made to squat not sit<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The answer probably won&#39;t be satisfying to you.<br/>
<br/>
One aspect of understanding unschooling is seeing how the world  <br/>
interconnects in order to let go of the idea of artificially dividing  <br/>
the world into subjects. Science, math, history, language, writing,  <br/>
engineering, sociology, architecture, computers ... they&#39;re all  <br/>
intertwined and part of everything.<br/>
<br/>
An unschooler learns science the same way he learns to speak. He&#39;ll  <br/>
pick up as much as he needs when he needs it. He&#39;ll add bits to it as  <br/>
he lives and absorbs. He&#39;ll refine his understanding as more bits are  <br/>
added, as more connections happen.<br/>
<br/>
Science will come from movies, from doing things to see what will  <br/>
happen, from observing life, from conversations, from asking questions  <br/>
-- the questions are more important than the answers actually :-),  <br/>
from seeing connections between very different bits of the world.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooled kids who are fascinated by how the world works will  <br/>
naturally do more things that look like science just because it  <br/>
fascinates them. You won&#39;t be able to stop them! Other kids will do  <br/>
things that look less like science but will still be building an  <br/>
understanding of how the world works and absorbing science facts from  <br/>
living in a home where curiosity is part of the environment.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-285533215">// I feel that we don&#39;t get nearly enough science so I wanted to ask real<br/>
&quot;unschoolers&quot; how they go about introducing science to their children, in<br/>
elementary and beyond //<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll leave the &quot;beyond&quot; to others. J  For us, here&#39;s some of the stuff we do<br/>
that could be considered science:<br/>
<br/>
-          Checking out books from the library with wacky experiments in<br/>
them and doing them for fun<br/>
<br/>
-          TV:  Mythbusters is a huge fave right now.  They also like Planet<br/>
Earth and some of the animal-related shows we find on Netflix.<br/>
<br/>
-          We get National Geographic Kids magazine and they also like the<br/>
videos on the website.<br/>
<br/>
-          We grow stuff.  We have a garden and flowers and fruit trees and<br/>
a worm bin and the kids love to participate along with us.<br/>
<br/>
-          They learn stuff about animals by having pets and by visiting the<br/>
zoo and aquarium and the local farms and the Serpetarium and so forth.<br/>
<br/>
-          We&#39;ve gone whale watching and we&#39;ve driven up to the mountains<br/>
where they&#39;ve gotten to see deer and elk and other wildlife in person.<br/>
<br/>
-          We go geocaching <br/>
<br/>
-          My kids gravitate to the science section at the library and often<br/>
come home with a pile of nature books.  <br/>
<br/>
-          We have an Usborne Children&#39;s Encyclopedia and my son in<br/>
particular loves to look through the pictures of space and the planets and<br/>
sea life and dinosaurs and so forth.<br/>
<br/>
-          We had a membership to the local Flight Museum for a year and the<br/>
kids just loved going there and climbing on the planes and looking at stuff.<br/>
<br/>
-          We have a local science center to visit<br/>
<br/>
-          We have 3 Children&#39;s Museums, all of which have some hands-on<br/>
science exhibits<br/>
<br/>
-          There&#39;s a local sci-fi museum that&#39;s pretty cool<br/>
<br/>
-          We go on family walks (we have dogs to walk!) around the local<br/>
trails and my kids hunt slugs and try to spot turtles and other life<br/>
<br/>
-          We look for constellations and watch the moon wax and wane<br/>
<br/>
-          We go down and look for salmon when they are running.  <br/>
<br/>
-          The kids look for and collect interesting rocks, leaves, sticks<br/>
and whatnot<br/>
<br/>
-          My daughter is a Brownie girl scout, and they are doing Water<br/>
Journey this fall which is all about water.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
None of this is rigorous participation in the scientific method.  But it&#39;s<br/>
fun and our kids are young.   When they are older we will offer them the<br/>
opportunity to take on science in a more traditional fashion if they are<br/>
interested.  There are science camps in the summer around here, and our<br/>
homeschooling group has a Young Inventors and Inventors clubs as well as<br/>
Lego League to participate in.  There&#39;s 4-H and Wilderness School and<br/>
probably other opportunities for natural science in a more structured<br/>
setting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-279204150">Science is a way of looking at the world. It&#39;s a method of finding things out. <br/>
It isn&#39;t a history or a set of facts, although that is often the way it is <br/>
described. In our home science is a tool we use to describe and discuss the <br/>
things around us. It&#39;s weighing and measuring information and opinions and the <br/>
things we see and experience. It isn&#39;t done in a teaching setting, there isn&#39;t <br/>
any introduction to science, it just is a part of the many and varied <br/>
conversations we have. <br/>

I also wanted to mention Bob Krampf&#39;s Experiments of the Week. Go to his website  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://thehappyscientist.com/">http://thehappyscientist.com/</a>   and subscribe to his FREE weekly newsletter to get an experiment in your inbox every (almost) Monday.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
None of his experiments require expensive equipment: he uses simple household items. Not to say that a microscope or telescope isn&#39;t a great addition to any home! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you like a certain experiment, you can find similar/related ones in the archives. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You can support his work with a meager $20/year and have TONS of science fun at your fingertips.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When I read this, I was reminded of how much fun a microscope has been to have in the house. My husband has the one that he had when he was a kid. He loves sharing it with the kids. We have since found another one at a thrift store. We have also found telescopes and other cool &quot;sciency&quot; stuff at thrift stores too. My girls have picked up on his interest in looking at things under the microscope. I will never forget the time my daughter skinned her knee while riding her bike. While she was sitting there bleeding, she decided that it would be cool to see what her blood looks like under the microscope. We doctored her up and saved some of her blood so we could look at it under the microscope. I think we still have the slide in our slide collection. We were at a store one time and my daughters found a set of prepared slides and had to have them. They have been an unending source of fun. Just last night, we were sitting watching TV and my oldest says, &quot;Hey mom, I wonder what salt looks like under the microscope.&quot; I have no idea where it came from but we got out the microscope and they proceeded to look at salt. That led to a quick look at pepper which led to them digging through the slide box. <br/>
<br/>
My oldest has always loved stuff that falls under the category of science. We never introduce her to stuff while thinking about science though. Science tends to naturally occur because there are so many cool things that can be considered science. Cleaning out my drains with vinegar and baking soda usually gets the kids attention because they love seeing the bubbles. There are so many things that we do in a day that can be considered science. When taking a bath, my girls have noticed that the water rises each time somebody gets in even though the water is off. When they shake up their cokes and explode them, that is science. Cooking in the kitchen is science. The discussion my husband and I had about the tires on his car losing air pressure when it got cold was science. My husband&#39;s love of amateur radio, astronomy, and making homemade beer (including root beer and soda) is science. There is a good chance that you can find science in pretty much anything. There is no need to isolate it from everyday living. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-283352149">Here&#39;s a link to my blog which has a couple of posts on how my son has learned <br/>
science.  It&#39;s not an all inclusive list, but maybe it will help you see how he <br/>
learns?<br/>
I also tend to add links for future reference so possibly some of them will<br/>
be useful to you.<br/>

<br/>
My son read a bunch of Stephen Hawkings&#39; books on Black Holes <br/>
and physics, which has lead him into further studies of the Cosmos <br/>
and such.  We have now rented tons of movies including Carl Sagon and all <br/>
the Star Trek series.  Yes, we are aware that Star Trek is just a &#39;TV Series&#39; <br/>
but it is entertaining and has lead to many discussions and math formulas <br/>
being worked, etc, etc. It has also lent itself for discussion on which writers <br/>
tried to hold on to facts and science and which ones just ran with a story line <br/>
regardless of physics.<br/>
<br/>
Peace and Laughter, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1283184515">I&#39;m starting to recognize the &#39;science&#39; around our household also.  Just last <br/>
night my 4 year old and I had a discussion -- prompted by him about what other <br/>
animals lay eggs.... I was fascinated on what animals besides birds he knew laid <br/>
eggs.  Than he phrased a question to me &quot;now what other animals lay eggs?&quot;  <br/>
These moments may not come every single day so distinct , however when you <br/>
really look at what science entails you find more.  Even making ice cubes <br/>
(states - liquid to solids), baking, etc<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1531100522">Not to mention that Star Trek ideas are already in existence or being<br/>
worked on...ever notice how cell phones often flip open like Star Trek<br/>
communication devices? Ever wonder who got the idea for the MRI? Did you<br/>
know that physicists and others are trying to figure out how to make<br/>
transporter technology actually work? They even reference it ON Star<br/>
Trek TNG sort of - they refer to a Heisenberg compensator or something<br/>
like that...it compensates for the (current) fact that you can&#39;t know<br/>
the location and motion of an atom at the same time (to put it really<br/>
unscientifically). There was a show on TV (Discovery channel maybe?) a<br/>
while back that looked at a whole list of things that came about because<br/>
Star Trek had a &#39;thing&#39; and real people said &quot;that would cool to have,<br/>
how can I make that happen?&quot;<br/>
