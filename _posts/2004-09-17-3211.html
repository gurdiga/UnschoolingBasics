<div id="ygrps-yiv-657797090">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I thought you might be interested in learning more about our cohousing <br/>
community in Western Middlesex County. Cohousing is a type of <br/>
neighborhood designed and managed by the people who live there. It <br/>
combines privacy and community in a clustered, pedestrian-oriented <br/>
neighborhood.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You own your own home, as well as a share of the common facilities. The <br/>
common building may include a large dining room, kitchen, lounges, <br/>
meeting rooms, children&#39;s space, library and workshops. Learn more at <br/>
our web site! -- <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.mosaic-commons.org">http://www.mosaic-commons.org</a><br/>
<br/>
This particular group has several unschooling families, although it is <br/>
open to folks of all educational philosphies.<br/>
<br/>
Please join us to learn about cohousing, and how we&#39;re building it.<br/>
<br/>
When: 1:00 on the 3rd Sunday of the month (Date)<br/>
<br/>
Where: Assabett Valley Family Networks, (Boys and Girls Club) Marlboro, MA<br/>
<br/>
For information, directions, a ride from the MBTA or to arrange <br/>
childcare, call 508-453-0566 or email <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:info@...">info@...</a>.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;People who choose cohousing come from a wide range of cultural, ethnic, <br/>
economic and professional backgrounds. It is a goal of cohousing <br/>
communities that their residents encompass various ages and stages of <br/>
life. In much the same way as an old fashioned village, the community <br/>
embraces its residents as they move through life.&quot; - The Cohousing <br/>
