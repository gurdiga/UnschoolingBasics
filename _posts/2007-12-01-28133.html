<div id="ygrps-yiv-1813433696">unschoolingbasicsMy suggestion -- don&#39;t go.<br/>
<br/>
Really.<br/>
<br/>
You are a grown woman making important decisions for your family and have just recently begun to feel settled in your new unschooling life and you are under absolutely no obligation to have that examined by a hostile crowd.<br/>
<br/>
Do yourself a favor and give yourself permission to say no. &quot;No thanks, we have other plans.&quot; Don&#39;t go on and on with some invented tale or feel you have to actually have other plans. If they can&#39;t be polite, and accept a polite refusal of an invitation, that is their problem.<br/>
<br/>
Let them talk about you behind your back while you relax and figure out how you want to spend your day and get on with your life. <br/>
<br/>
Then, next year, or the year after that, if you are feeling up to it, and have it in you to tell people when to back off (you know, no one in our family ever questions me and DH about our choices when it comes to our children -- why do you think that is? :) ) then think about whether you want to attend the annual party.<br/>
<br/>
Part of being free is actually enjoying yourself! :)<br/>

<br/>
Anyway I need some help for this up coming party - It is <br/>
a challenge for me to make them understand - I get stuck with &quot;It is <br/>
the right thing for us to do - I haven&#39;t been so sure of anything <br/>
before.&quot; Well that holds very little water as it should. I am happy <br/>
that they care so much about my guys and don&#39;t want to discourage <br/>
that but how can I convince them it will be OK? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help, handouts and suggestions. <br/>
