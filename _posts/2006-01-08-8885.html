<div id="ygrps-yiv-404771566">I understand your frustration. My son was 3 1/2 when he was potty-<br/>
trained. I was beginning to wonder if he&#39;d still be in diapers when <br/>
he went to college ;)  <br/>
<br/>
The first thing for you to do is... relax. I promise you, your child <br/>
will learn to use the toilet. <br/>
<br/>
Secondly, have there been many changes in your family&#39;s life lately? <br/>
Our pediatrician at the time thought our son&#39;s reluctance was due, in <br/>
part, to stressors or changes in the household (he&#39;d be &quot;thisclose&quot; <br/>
to being completely out of diapers, then something major would <br/>
happen - we&#39;d move, my husband had his foot crushed at work - you get <br/>
the idea - and he&#39;d be back in diapers refusing to use the toilet. <br/>
His doctor said it was fairly common for changes to affect a child&#39;s <br/>
toilet training, as that was pretty much the only area of a child&#39;s <br/>
life that they (the child) has *complete* control over.)<br/>
<br/>
You can try moving the potty to whatever room they&#39;re in. I know this <br/>
works for many kids - mine was not one of them. He absolutely, <br/>
positively refused to go to the bathroom in any room *but* the <br/>
bathroom. He said if daddy didn&#39;t go potty in the living room, he <br/>
wasn&#39;t going to, either! <br/>
<br/>
My cousin suggested that I give up the pull-ups altogether and use <br/>
regular cloth underwear with plastic covers to go over them (yes, you <br/>
can get them in sizes for bigger kids). My son *hated* the wet <br/>
feeling of the underwear and was using the toilet exclusively in <br/>
about 3 days. <br/>
