<div id="ygrps-yiv-1796723403">Dear all,<br/>
<br/>
Can one can deschool and unschol before having children? I mean, for ourselves? <br/>
<br/>
And, do we unschool with children from birth to six or that is something that starts at &quot;schoil age&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I did.  I found out about unschooling, immersed myself in it by joining online groups, reading anything I could find, and soaking it in, and then I quit my teaching job. Three years later I had my first child.  Jumping into unschooling wasn&#39;t anything I did on purpose.  It was more of an irresistible drive.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think it will be fully effective, though, until the learning  <br/>
is done instead of school. People have always learned things outside  <br/>
of school. Pretty much everything people do that isn&#39;t a subject in  <br/>
school, they learn on their own. Where the idea of unschooling makes  <br/>
sense is when people assume school is necessary for a chunk of  <br/>
learning but  someone chooses instead to learn by living and doing and  <br/>
exploring.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And, do we unschool with children from birth to six or that is  <br/>
&gt; something that starts at &quot;schoil age&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;Not schooling&quot; kids when they wouldn&#39;t be in school anyway doesn&#39;t  <br/>
have much meaning.<br/>
<br/>
An unschooling parent might be living with their kids exactly the same  <br/>
before school age as they do after school age, but until the &quot;learning  <br/>
by exploring what interests them&quot; is being done *instead* of school,  <br/>
then it&#39;s living a rich life.<br/>
<br/>
Looked at one way, it doesn&#39;t make sense to live the same way with a  <br/>
child who is 4 and then 5 but call it something different.<br/>
<br/>
Looked at another way, that unschooling is the choice to reject the  <br/>
idea that school is necessary and instead learn by exploring, then it  <br/>
does make sense.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I found all things unschooling very helpful to contemplate from before the birth of my kids.  I do consider myself (with kids ages 3 and 6) to be unschooling, although I could find a different word if I needed it.  What I say we&#39;re unschooling, I mean that we&#39;ve diverged from the adult-child pattern of interaction demonstrated clearly in schools but enacted everywhere with kids of all ages.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of baby/young kid discussions here:<br/>

 </span></blockquote>*******************<br/>
<br/>
You can start deschooling the moment you leave school - high school anyway. Some college kids do a certain amount of deschooling while living at college - the get to &quot;deschool&quot; some of the &quot;non academic&quot; stuff at least and you can see it in the all night pizza parties and wild drunken escapades ;)<br/>
<br/>
Some people don&#39;t ever quite deschool but carry school with them into their adult lives. That&#39;s part of why school has become the standard of childcare - because too many parents haven&#39;t done enough deschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And, do we unschool with children from birth to six or that is something that starts at &quot;school age&quot;?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>**************<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been on unschooling lists for close to a decade, now, and &quot;school age&quot; matters. It&#39;s a big, big, big stumbling block for many, many parents who would Like to unschool. There&#39;s a Lot of social pressure to put kids in school - from spouses and friends and extended family, from television and books and music and random strangers in the grocery store. &quot;Unschooling&quot; babies and toddlers is no guarantee a family will unschool past school age. <br/>
<br/>
That being said, depending on where you live there&#39;s also a Lot of pressure to get kids in &quot;the right pre-school&quot; which is just as hard to manage as the &quot;school age&quot; pressure. So to an extent, it depends on  your environment. <br/>
<br/>
It is also the case that deschooling isn&#39;t something you ever really stop doing, if you&#39;ve been through school, yourself. Even seasoned unschoolers will have pangs of &quot;omg, she&#39;s 12, she should know...&quot; now and again, as personal issues come up in relation to our kids. If Your history is school, then to an extent that&#39;s going to be your means of comparison to your kids. Ray didn&#39;t drive at 16 - still isn&#39;t driving at 18 - and that brings up schoolish worries for me, worries about keeping up with the norm and doing what the other kids do. Mo&#39;s 10, and sometimes I worry that she&#39;s not as savvy about this or that as her age-peers. But those are My issues, not things I dump on my kids - that&#39;s one thing I have learned from unschooling, how to keep my own just mostly to myself. Mostly ;)<br/>
