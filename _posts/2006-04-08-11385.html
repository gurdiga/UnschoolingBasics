<div id="ygrps-yiv-827548537">Okay, after nine years of homeschooling we are starting the <br/>
unschooling method.  We have just begun the &quot;deschooling&quot;, yet I am <br/>
not real sure what we are doing with this or how we go about starting <br/>
unschooling when the deschooling is completed.  This could get really <br/>
confusing.  I am reading lots of books that have been recommended to <br/>
me, as well as old post here and other forums, along with articles on <br/>
the web trying to understand it all.  However, it is very <br/>
overwhelming.  I have two teenagers, 17 and 13 and we are all excited <br/>
about this new way of learning, yet full of questions.  After years of <br/>
giving the work for the to do, do I now wait for them to come to me on <br/>
what they want to do and then provide the tools to learn it?  Or do I <br/>
suggest topics for them and provide the materials as they first begin <br/>
and then go from there.  Any help with these questions would be much <br/>
appreciated.  Thank you</div>

Neither and both.:)<br/>
What you do now, is declare a vacation. You pretend that school does<br/>
not exist. You choose to do the things you all love to do when you&#39;re<br/>
&quot;off&quot;.<br/>
Watch movies, play games, check out new places, do whatever brings the<br/>
family and individuals JOY. In short, live your lives. Forget about<br/>
school and learning and just LIVE.<br/>
<br/>
Within good living, comes learning. But you don&#39;t need to worry about<br/>
it or focus on how to make it happen, it&#39;s a side effect of a life<br/>
lived well.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The simple answer is yes.  Both.  The more complex answer is working towards<br/>
self-discovery.  Deschooling evolves into unschooling.  So as they deschool<br/>
and get comfortable with unschooling they are going to start venturing out<br/>
on their own.  Where you come in is when they say, &quot;I&#39;m bored.&quot;  That&#39;s when<br/>
you can offer suggestions.  Start with the question, &quot;What is it you want to<br/>
do?&quot;  If they still say &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; then offer a suggestion such as &quot;Do<br/>
you want to create something or be entertained or be physical?&quot;  From there<br/>
you can narrow down what it is they want.  My teen goes through periods<br/>
where she will say she is bored and what she really means is that she is<br/>
restless.  She needs to go outside and do something physical or she needs to<br/>
create.  Static activities aren&#39;t working for her such as reading, games,<br/>
tv.<br/>
<br/>
Have you had the Teenage Liberation Handbook recommended yet?  It&#39;s a good<br/>
read for all of you!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d suggest you just think of this deschooling time as a vacation. What would you do with the kids if your home was a hotel  and your town was brand new to you? Maybe they&#39;d want to hang out in the room for awhile. Maybe swim a little. Maybe read a fun trashy novel. Play some video games? A leisurely lunch? A stroll through downtown? A movie? A tourist trap? <br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t matter exactly what you do. You just need to relax and get in vacation mode. Once you can get to that state of mind, the ideas for even more exciting, interesting, fun and creative things will bubble up from all of you. But you&#39;ve got to relax first. School and school at home puts a strain on family relations and a person&#39;s ability to think for themselves. Give yourselves some time to rediscover your passions.<br/>
