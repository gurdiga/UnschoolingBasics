You can buy workbooks anywhere. Walmart, K-Mart...all those stores <br/>
sell them. That was a good idea what you said...to put them in with <br/>

we unschool, the less my kids need them. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1031359804">We LOVE the KUMON workbooks - they are creative and fun (at least the<br/>
early ones - very crafty). Barnes and Nobles and teacher supply stores<br/>
have a good selection. I would take him with you and see what he<br/>
likes. Also, don&#39;t forget games (like word searches and suduko). Even<br/>
if you don&#39;t want to do workbooks, I would search for the best<br/>
quality, most interesting ones you can find. There is alot of crap out<br/>
there that really is a waste of time. Maybe he would like scrapbooking<br/>
his projects. That seems like a creative way to enter into<br/>
unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1372514738">***What&#39;s the correct unschooling way to handle this?***<br/>
<br/>
Couple of thoughts.   If you are busy and having fun and going places and<br/>
playing he might not really want workbooks.  His request for workbooks<br/>
might be him choosing the lesser of two evils regarding schooling;<br/>
Curriculum vs. workbook.    He might not have a picture in his head yet<br/>
of what life without school can look like.  Workbooks might be as close<br/>
as he can come, in his mind, to &quot;no school.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d wait on the workbooks.  I&#39;d get a new video game first, or go ten<br/>
different places this week or go camping.  I&#39;d fill the next month with<br/>
adventure and fun.  I&#39;d let the workbook stuff simmer.  It might<br/>
evaporate altogether. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If not,  Barnes and Nobel have a table with crossword puzzle books and<br/>
sudoku, and sometimes the magazine racks at grocery stores have word<br/>
finder or jumbles or the like.   Dover sells cool and inexpensive stained<br/>
glass coloring books or famous paintings coloring books, etc.  <br/>

   <br/>
  I wouldn&#39;t bother to spend money on a whole curriculum, especially if you don&#39;t expect to use it.  Workbooks can be bought at Walmart, Target, teachers&#39; stores, second-hand bookstores -- heck, my local grocery store usually has a few.  They seem to be everywhere.  I&#39;ve noticed that most every store that sells school supplies will put out some &#39;summer study&#39; sort of workbooks designed for school kids so they don&#39;t forget what they learned in school.  Some poor kids never get a break!<br/>
   <br/>
  We usually have one or two around, because my mil or an auntie will send one for Andy.  I suppose now that Dan is school-age, he&#39;ll probably get a few, too.  The boys like the early ones because they&#39;re filled with hidden picture or &#39;what&#39;s wrong in this picture&#39; kind of games.  As the grade-level increases, tho, the books seem to be more about math and grammar, and my kids toss them aside almost immediately.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-129387707">All this talk about workbooks reminds me of a question I&#39;ve had about my own kids from time to time.  Coloring books.  My kids have zero desire for them.  They love hidden pictures, what&#39;s wrong with the picture, and which two are the same kind of books and puzzles, but will skip over the coloring pages every time.  <br/>
   <br/>
  They don&#39;t often use crayons at all, tho we have a big box of them.  Most of their artwork is free-form, in pen or pencil and uncolored.  I remember loving coloring books as a kid -- I still love them, but as I think about this more I realize that I don&#39;t remember doing as much free-form art as they do.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Is this difference an unschooling thing? Or are my kids the only ones who simply don&#39;t do art designed by others?  If it is an unschooling thing, then for me it&#39;s another reason to unschool my kids -- to preserve their own sense of creativity and art, and not let them have it determined by others. <br/>
   <br/>
  Looking at myself, I know my perceived lack of creativity in most things is because of school.  I was the smart one, and not the artistic one -- art was for my brother, who was flighty and moody and all things creative.  I quickly began to think of myself as not creative.  Now, 40 years later I&#39;m still trying to find my own creative spark.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1860074157">My DS preferred/prefers using pens and fine markers from the get go to <br/>
do line drawings-coloring pages tended to be glossed over with one or <br/>
maybe two colors scrawled around. He uses more colors now because I <br/>
get to be one team and he&#39;s another team (so we have different colors) <br/>
and the explosions and battles are usually red (for blowing up stuff) <br/>
and sometimes yellow too. Still mostly line drawings but more colors <br/>
(thank heaven for big Sam&#39;s Club packs of colored pens!) Crayons get <br/>
used sometimes but not a whole lot and rarely for coloring in someone <br/>
else&#39;s picture. One thing we like crayons for is when we cover the <br/>
kitchen table with brown paper sheets (rolls of it are cheap) and then <br/>
keep crayons, pens, markers, pencils on hand in a big bowl or bucket <br/>
to draw and write at will.<br/>
<br/>
Even in Bible class, DS rarely colored the coloring pages - just not <br/>
interested in them I guess. And that&#39;s okay with me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My daughter did some coloring books but she has generally preferred  <br/>
making her own drawings. I think it has always been part of story  <br/>
telling to her.<br/>
<br/>
But I think coloring books are a different form of art than freeform  <br/>
drawing and they&#39;re going to appeal to different artistic talents.  <br/>
They&#39;re more like graphic art, playing with color without having to  <br/>
concern yourself also with something that looks like you want it to.<br/>
<br/>
There might be a technological reason too. There are just so many  <br/>
things available that are more fascinating to kids. Even in the world  <br/>
of art, It&#39;s lots easier to play around with color using a paint  <br/>
bucket in an art program -- not to mention you can change things  <br/>
instantly if you don&#39;t like them -- than to color things by hand! ;-)<br/>

Bad Mom Admission coming up:<br/>
<br/>
My son didn&#39;t color in them when he was little.  Anytime I would <br/>
suggest it, he would say, &quot;You can color if you want.&quot;  What he would <br/>
do is ask me to read them.  (They are books, ya know....)  Do you <br/>
have any idea how BORING the average little-kid coloring book is?  I <br/>
used to hide them, because I couldn&#39;t stand reading them, then feel <br/>
guilty, put them back on the shelf, thinking maybe he would like <br/>
coloring now, then hide them again....  It&#39;s not that I minded <br/>
reading to my son (I still do for some things, and he is 14!), it was <br/>
the mind-numbing content.  I can handle Dr. Suess, I can handle a <br/>
lot, but....<br/>
<br/>
That said, when he went to K, he became PASSIONATE about coloring, <br/>
carefully chosing what he felt was the exact right color.  I pulled <br/>
out my old box of 64 (I&#39;m a pack rat, and it was from the days that <br/>
that WAS the Big Box!), and he happily sorted through the colors, <br/>
walked around commenting things like, &quot;That car is a nice cerulan.&quot;  <br/>
(I admit, I don&#39;t have a normal child!)  People who knew him got him <br/>
crayons for his birthday (those who didn&#39;t, got him cars....)<br/>
<br/>
I think it is less an unschooly thing than a personal difference.  <br/>
Why should ALL kids enjoy exactly the same things, and exactly at the <br/>
same time?  <br/>
<br/>

uncolored.<br/>
<br/>
When my son was little, his usual medium was sidewalk chalk on the <br/>
driveway.  He made BIG pictures, usually his version of a vacuum <br/>
cleaner (a big circle with a stick at either end -- it was a bag, a <br/>
nozzle and a plug in his mind) or a carpet sweeper (a big circle with <br/>
lots of little lines off it).  <br/>
<br/>
He did some drawing on paper at some point, but not a lot.  <br/>
<br/>
The really really ironic thing is -- it turns out, he has quite an <br/>
eye for shading.  Last summer, he decided he was going to make a <br/>
comic strip out of legos taking pictures with his digital camera<br/>
because, &quot;I can&#39;t draw; I&#39;m no good at it.&quot;  Exact quote.  A month or <br/>
so later, he was taking a class, once a week (with a homeschool <br/>
educational support thingy) called the creatives.  The first class <br/>
was actually not much, but he ended up with a sketch pad, and started <br/>
sketching.  I was SHOCKED.  He drew very well, with great perspective <br/>
and shading.  Makes me wonder what other things he may be hiding in <br/>
that noggin of his!<br/>

<br/>
I hear you!  I am the same way -- I was a total klutz, had lousy fine-<br/>
motor coordination.  I think I&#39;m a REALLY late bloomer.  As an adult, <br/>
I have done some fun and (if I say so myself) not too bad things with <br/>
polymer clay (my son and I were really immersed it that for a while), <br/>
and lately I&#39;ve been trying to teach myself one-stroke painting.  I&#39;m <br/>
having so much fun experimenting!  <br/>

and he&#39;d say, &quot;No, read the rest of this article.&quot; So I&#39;d sit there  <br/>
reading, &quot;The winning brand of canned whole tomatoes from our 2005  <br/>
tasting was Progresso,&quot; or &quot;With the tomato flavor under control, it  <br/>
was time to develop more depth of flavor. Onions added a pleasant  <br/>
sweetness...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes he really wants to read a certain thing, and it&#39;s not clear  <br/>
to me what he&#39;s getting out of it. So I remind myself that I don&#39;t  <br/>
have to know. My job is just to read it to him.<br/>
