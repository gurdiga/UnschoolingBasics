<div id="ygrps-yiv-1708277034">I don&#39;t feel like I have much advice to give because we are having <br/>
major struggles right now with our son too.  He has never been <br/>
diagnosed but I am sure there is one out there for him.  My husband <br/>
feels very strongly about not giving him a label but rather trying <br/>
to feel our way through it.  I am to the point where I want more <br/>
information about how his little brain works because I feel like we <br/>
are going in the wrong direction at times.  He is VERY explosive, <br/>
and I don&#39;t know if this helps you at all, but we have figured out <br/>
that when he gets to that point and we have to remove him from <br/>
everyone that he needs about ten minutes to cool off without ANYONE <br/>
around.  After that ten minutes he almost forgets that there was <br/>
anything wrong.  The trick though is that absolutely no one can be <br/>
around him when he is exploding.  In the past, we have tried to <br/>
console him, or get angry at him when he is calling us names in the <br/>
middle of his rages.  We have now learned to just walk away and let <br/>
him rage.  Sometimes that goes against what radical unschoolers <br/>
suggest but that is the only thing that allows him to come off his <br/>
rage.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing that we have come to realize is that there has to be <br/>
food available for him to grab at all times.  If his blood sugar <br/>
gets even slightly low or he is hungry at all, there is probably a <br/>
rage right around the corner.  Sleep is also HUGE for him, and it is <br/>
just not a matter of getting enough but when he gets it.  If he is <br/>
not asleep by midnight, regardless of when he wakes up, the next day <br/>
is likely to be a difficult one.  <br/>
<br/>
He is also very sensitive to lots of noise!  Last night we were at a <br/>
HUGE family gathering and I learned something new about him.  He had <br/>
his PSP and was playing it in a corner by himself almost the entire <br/>
evening and the evening went as smooth as ever.  So I guess if he is <br/>
focused on something when there is all of this noise and commotion <br/>
around him, he doesn&#39;t really notice it.  So now the PSP is coming <br/>
everywhere with us!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Another thing that we have noticed that helps a lot is LOTS of hugs <br/>
and positive comments and compliments, during the day, about the <br/>
things that we love about him.  It is so easy to get focused on the <br/>
rages because they spend so much of our energy but he needs to know <br/>
how wonderful he is!!  And the great thing about him is that just as <br/>
intense as his rages are, so is the intensity of his love and <br/>
compassion for people!!!<br/>

him rage.I have tried this but he will follow me screaming and cursing,or worse throw something at me,so I have to stay with him.But I do get my younger dh away.  Sometimes that goes against what radical unschoolers <br/>

just not a matter of getting enough but when he gets it.  If he is <br/>
not asleep by midnight, regardless of when he wakes up, the next day <br/>
is likely to be a difficult one. We have to give him benadryll at night or he would stay up for 24 hrs straight or longer and would rage for days.He has never gone to sleep without something to help him since he was 2.Before that he never slept more than 2 hrs at a time. <br/>

how wonderful he is!!  And the great thing about him is that just as <br/>
intense as his rages are, so is the intensity of his love and <br/>
compassion for people!!!This brought tears to my eyes,I came from a very abusive home growing up and have often said that Elijah was placed in my life to teach me real love and how to express it.He is the most loving human being I know,but then I know that you know exactly where I am coming from&lt;smile&gt;<br/>
  Thanks you have helped me more than you know.<br/>
