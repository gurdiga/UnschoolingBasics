<div id="ygrps-yiv-1055611174">OK...<br/>
<br/>
Just the facts...<br/>
<br/>
boy DOB 15 Oct 96 so just about 12.  Rarely showers.  Is in puberty.<br/>
 Owns deodorant.  Rarely uses it.  Has BO.  What do I do?<br/>
<br/>
I *mostly* leave him alone about it.  Can&#39;t figure out a way to say &quot;hey I<br/>
can smell you&quot; without hurting or embarrassing him.  (That kind of thing<br/>
would upset me.)  BUT I don&#39;t want to smell BO either.  He showered today<br/>
because I had to say something.  The smell was bad.  I don&#39;t know how long<br/>
it&#39;s been since he&#39;s showered last but it&#39;s been weeks at least.  But like I<br/>
said I&#39;ve been leaving him to his own body ownership.<br/>
<br/>
SO....I can pull out the &quot;my house my rules&quot; crap and &quot;make&quot; him shower and<br/>
use deodorant.  Leave him alone and we all have to smell the BO.  OR?  I&#39;m<br/>
SURE there are more options but I&#39;m unable to see them...likely because this<br/>
is my issue.  But by the same token, puberty is different for him and what<br/>
worked before does not work now.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I told him today.  That puberty does funky stuff to the body<br/>
beyond things he could see and that one of the things is a stronger odor.<br/>
 Could be that he will take the initiative and shower daily now but I doubt<br/>
it.  That&#39;s not really on his radar yet.<br/>
<br/>
So, help me see the way to honor him as a person but also to honor the way<br/>
we want to live.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-148886381">I&#39;m interested in this topic as well. My son is not yet 7 so it&#39;s  <br/>
hardly an issue yet, but lately he&#39;s not been bathing as often as he  <br/>
once did. (All behaviour subject to change with age and time I&#39;m  <br/>
sure). Unfortunately, I would have a problem with scented body washes,  <br/>
soaps, perfumes etc. (they make me ill) so this option wouldn&#39;t work  <br/>
for me. I&#39;m keen to hear how to otherwise address this issue. I once  <br/>
had to tell a dear friend that she had BO, and I found it very  <br/>
stressful to approach her. Happily, she was very receptive to knowing,  <br/>
and asked me to please tell her any time I noticed; she bathed daily  <br/>
and was unaware of her own BO.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-900777413">We all use salt block or crystal deodorant, and have had no problems. My <br/>
daughter has sensitive skin and perfumes bother most of us. I feel <br/>
really sick when my mother in-law visits with her hairspray and perfume. <br/>
This comes in different forms- an actual rock, one that looks like a <br/>
stick deodorant, and a spray. We buy soaps and shampoos, etc without <br/>
fragrance at our coop. I know this might not be as fun, but the salt <br/>
block is kind of cool and works really well. There are SO many products <br/>
out there- maybe you could find something fun that didn&#39;t bother you?<br/>
<br/>
In the past we found natural bubble bath, and gone swimming often, <br/>
played in the hose, all those things get you clean, too. The kids pretty <br/>
much take care of their own cleanliness now, they are 11 and 15, and <br/>
don&#39;t even need reminders very often any more. I just make sure I wake <br/>
them up early enough so they have time to bathe if they feel they need <br/>
to before we go out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2051676447">These are all great!  I have a puberty hating child right now (he dislikes it, not me).  We call <br/>
it PMS--pre-manhood syndrome.  It has been quite painful for him as he is growing too <br/>
fast for his bones, muscles, etc to keep up.  He will be 13 in November and is almost as <br/>
tall as I am.  (5&#39; 11&quot; for those curious).  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t pester him, but I have mentioned a couple times that oh we are going to do <br/>
something out soon, did you want to shower first?  We let him pick his deodorant (as I <br/>
didn&#39;t think the baby powder fresh scent was what he was looking for....)<br/>
<br/>
As for body wash he picked some out at Bath and Body works (if I did the Axe thing for <br/>
him he would turn bright red!).  His main issue with puberty is something I never had, <br/>
acne!  He is really embarrassed by it.  We have tried a few different things, but nothing <br/>
seems to really help, or he just forgets to use it.  I don&#39;t pester him about that either and <br/>
he usually chooses to wash his face once a day or so...which is better than I would have <br/>
done at that age.  It isn&#39;t severe acne, but enough to be a bother.  Mostly on the forehead.  <br/>
He wants to have his hair long, but when it is the acne gets worse, so he usually chooses <br/>
to cut it.<br/>
<br/>
He is so quiet about these things and rarely has questions.....we do try to bring things up <br/>
for him and if he is interested in discussion fine.  So as they get used to all the new odors <br/>
and body hair we get used to finding new ways to say things without making them want to <br/>
hide and become hermits!  (Yes mine got his moustache the beginning of spring this <br/>
year....aurgh!  He hasn&#39;t shaved yet.....and he wants to get rid of the unibrow that is <br/>
sprouting....*sigh*)<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-46190890">Oh I should state our 2nd son, just turned 10, is a Calvin (you know like the comic strip) <br/>
and might take a bath once a week if you remind him a couple times.  LOL  He took one <br/>
last night and said it &quot;hurt his hair&quot;....hum He wants to learn to make his own organic soap <br/>
and use organic materials to scent them.  Lavender is a great one.  Maybe you could make <br/>
soap together?  Soap molds are inexpensive, sometimes found at garage sales.  Lots of <br/>
info on the internet with recipes and ideas.  Just a thought.<br/>
<br/>
I have a dear friend who doesn&#39;t/can&#39;t use deodorant.  The chemicals in it react with her <br/>
skin.  She uses lavender water and things from the middle ages/days before chemical <br/>
*enhancement*...you&#39;d be surprised what they used to keep the smell down.  Most people <br/>
didn&#39;t take baths all winter long so they wouldn&#39;t catch cold.  Can&#39;t imagine the Knights in <br/>
their armor smelled very well either.  So there are other options that aren&#39;t chemical...Rose <br/>
water smells lovely! :)  And not in the strong perfumed way either.<br/>

&gt; for me. I&#39;m keen to hear how to otherwise address this issue. I once  <br/>
&gt; had to tell a dear friend that she had BO, and I found it very  <br/>
&gt; stressful to approach her. Happily, she was very receptive to knowing,  <br/>
&gt; and asked me to please tell her any time I noticed; she bathed daily  <br/>
&gt; and was unaware of her own BO.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Help me not fall back into old ways!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; OK...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Just the facts...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; boy DOB 15 Oct 96 so just about 12. Rarely showers. Is in puberty.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Owns deodorant. Rarely uses it. Has BO. What do I do?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I *mostly* leave him alone about it. Can&#39;t figure out a way to say  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;hey I<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; can smell you&quot; without hurting or embarrassing him. (That kind of  <br/>
&gt; &gt; thing<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; would upset me.) BUT I don&#39;t want to smell BO either. He showered  <br/>
&gt; &gt; today<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; because I had to say something. The smell was bad. I don&#39;t know how  <br/>
&gt; &gt; long<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; it&#39;s been since he&#39;s showered last but it&#39;s been weeks at least. But  <br/>
&gt; &gt; like I<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; said I&#39;ve been leaving him to his own body ownership.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; SO....I can pull out the &quot;my house my rules&quot; crap and &quot;make&quot; him  <br/>
&gt; &gt; shower and<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; use deodorant. Leave him alone and we all have to smell the BO. OR?  <br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; SURE there are more options but I&#39;m unable to see them...likely  <br/>
&gt; &gt; because this<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; is my issue. But by the same token, puberty is different for him and  <br/>
&gt; &gt; what<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; worked before does not work now.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; That&#39;s what I told him today. That puberty does funky stuff to the  <br/>
&gt; &gt; body<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; beyond things he could see and that one of the things is a stronger  <br/>
&gt; &gt; odor.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Could be that he will take the initiative and shower daily now but I  <br/>
&gt; &gt; doubt<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; it. That&#39;s not really on his radar yet.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So, help me see the way to honor him as a person but also to honor  <br/>
&gt; &gt; the way<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; we want to live.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s absolutely relevant at an unschooling discussion list. You&#39;ll<br/>
hear a lot about how being your child&#39;s &quot;teacher&quot; is absolutely<br/>
unecessary. Learning happens best when the idea of &quot;teaching&quot; is less<br/>
important than the idea of learning.<br/>
<br/>
A child that is passionate about poetry will continue to joyfully<br/>
explore it if the parent isn&#39;t intent on &quot;teaching&quot; or helping them<br/>
study a thing as much as they are intent on simply sharing the passion<br/>
WITH the child. That&#39;s a very different thing than studying or curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
I highly recommend reading for a couple of weeks to get a feel for the<br/>
list and why we&#39;re here. <br/>

I hope you won&#39;t teach it. That might ruin her interest. <br/>
<br/>
Why is it that if you loved studying poetry (sounds like maybe you<br/>
learned it without undue pressure?) you don&#39;t feel qualified to simply<br/>
share that with your child and seek out resources SHE desires?<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what unschooling is all about. Not teaching. Not studying.<br/>
Unless that&#39;s what the LEARNER (rather than the parents) decide is<br/>
important for themselves.<br/>

Your child needs a person who can access resources, certainly. She<br/>
doesn&#39;t need a teacher.<br/>

<br/>
Some lists are for discussion.<br/>
<br/>
I think if you walked into a curriculum recovery group and  <br/>
interrupted an ongoing discussion to demand everyone drop what  <br/>
they&#39;re doing and make a list of poetry analysis books for you, you  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t be shocked when the long time members protect the group  <br/>
with &quot;Why are you asking?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m betting reading your question asking for resources for poetry  <br/>
analysis stirred up fears in some members that they&#39;ve been  <br/>
neglecting their children&#39;s poetry education. That&#39;s not fair to them  <br/>
when we&#39;re trying to help them let go of those fears and see learning  <br/>
more holistically.<br/>
<br/>
Responses to posts support the purpose of the list even if they  <br/>
aren&#39;t what you wanted.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if someone had said &quot;My daughter has gotten interested in poetry  <br/>
and wants to delve into understanding it better and has asked for  <br/>
some resources. Can you help me help her?&quot; the responses would have  <br/>
been more straightforward.<br/>
<br/>
But as it was, it&#39;s not fair to the other members to support one  <br/>
parent&#39;s demand for &quot;curricula&quot; when it would interfere with those  <br/>
hoping for help letting go.<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s rude to cross post. It treats list members as though they&#39;re  <br/>
at the beck and call of whoever can click Send.<br/>

I love the really minimalist stuff in poetry such as:<br/>
 so much depends<br/>
upon  a red wheel<br/>
barrow  glazed with rain<br/>
water  beside the white<br/>
chickens By William Carlos Williams.  Awesome.  Thought provoking.<br/>
Reflective (almost literally) as I think all poems should be.  LUV it.  I<br/>
also think of much prose as highly poetic, such as *anything* by Rumi.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;Why do the resources need to be age discriminatory?&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;Why poetry appreciation (you gain appreciation for poetry by reading it<br/>
&gt; and exploring it in your own way and time...just like anything) rather<br/>
&gt; than just finding favorite poetry? &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Not sure I should be answering this but I will anyway -- I *studied*<br/>
&gt; poetry,<br/>
&gt; loved *studying* it, but don&#39;t feel qualified enough to teach it. I do<br/>
&gt; think there is a reason why books are written and sold and bought and used.<br/>

I think if you walked into a curriculum recovery group and  <br/>
interrupted an ongoing discussion to demand everyone drop what  <br/>
they&#39;re doing and make a list of poetry analysis books &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It was a mere question, a mere request -- and really, it&#39;s all at the<br/>
discretion of the moderator to let a post through or not.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;That&#39;s not fair to them  <br/>
when we&#39;re trying to help them let go of those fears and see learning  <br/>
more holistically.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Funnily, I do see a point here.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;<br/>
Now, if someone had said &quot;My daughter has gotten interested in poetry  <br/>
and wants to delve into understanding it better and has asked for  <br/>
some resources. Can you help me help her?&quot; the responses would have  <br/>
been more straightforward.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, mere perspective...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;<br/>
And it&#39;s rude to cross post. It treats list members as though they&#39;re  <br/>
at the beck and call of whoever can click Send.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is that a rule on this list, because I&#39;ve been on listserves for something<br/>
like 13 years, and don&#39;t believe that I have ever come across this.<br/>
Flaming, on the other hand (for no apparent or a misconstrued reason) has<br/>
always been condoned.<br/>
<br/>
I do hope the moderator will step in here and put things in the right<br/>
perspective.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, I am wondering if there is a way to retract a post<br/>
previously made.<br/>

&lt;&lt;In unschooling, *nobody* is qualified to teach but everybody can share and<br/>
learn.  &quot;Share&quot; really is not at all the same as &quot;teach&quot;.<br/>

&quot;Not really -- I currently am her mentor/guide/mother/teacher/friend rolled<br/>

~~I *studied* poetry,<br/>
loved *studying* it, but don&#39;t feel qualified enough to teach it~~<br/>
<br/>
Which implies that you plan to teach it and that&#39;s why you&#39;re<br/>
requesting curriculum and &quot;resources&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
When my child gets excited about something, I don&#39;t switch into that<br/>
whole &quot;teachable moments&quot; mode that gets bandied about at a lot of<br/>
homeschooling groups.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is a different world. Have you read any John Holt books?<br/>
How much of the unschooling philosophy have you encountered thus far?<br/>
<br/>
My personal interest in poetry is being nourished by an amazing human<br/>
being by the name of Stanley Kunitz. I&#39;ve carried a quote of his in my<br/>
head for so many years and finally purchased a book. The quote is this:<br/>
&quot;The hard inescapable phenomenon to be faced is that we are living and<br/>
dying at once. My commitment is to report that dialogue.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He was a passionate gardener and poet. &quot;The Wild Braid&quot; is an<br/>
exploration of his ideas and thoughts as recorded by Genine Lentine,<br/>
with a smattering of his amazing poems.<br/>
<br/>
The way I found this poet was through a simple quote, that has defined<br/>
so many things for me. It led to questions and research and more<br/>
questions...like natural learning does so often. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>No there isn&#39;t.  You can delete it on the web list.  However people who<br/>
receive posts by email have an &quot;undeletable by you&quot; post.  Are there other<br/>
reasons besides the cross posting issue that you would want to retract your<br/>
post?<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, though, people here though primarily interested in unschooling<br/>
discussion would love to help find resources for your daughter.  Are you<br/>
interested in doing that?  If so, post some of what she&#39;s interested in and<br/>
see if anyone has something she could use.<br/>
