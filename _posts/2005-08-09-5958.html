<div id="ygrps-yiv-1650622656">Sydney 9 1/2 has been unschooled since age 6 or so.  She periodically likes<br/>
to &quot;play school&quot; but she&#39;s very serious about it.  Anyway, she&#39;s asking for<br/>
&quot;school books :  Math, history, spelling, science, books.&quot;  I want to get<br/>
her stuff she&#39;ll find intenerating and that isn&#39;t obnoxiously schooly.  Any<br/>
suggestions?  books you like that are sort of subjects but in a fun way.  I<br/>
would like to emphasize that I have no interest in encouraging the<br/>
schooliness of this request but I want to honor dd&#39;s request and desire to<br/>
do these things.  (Those of you who know her will laugh I know)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Go to Borders or B&N and let her take her pick from whatever they <br/>
have (I know B&N has lots of &#39;homeschool&#39; books and workbooks, <br/>
especially this time of year). Use your discount card with the <br/>
purchase. Maybe even pick up something for yourself. Then go sit in <br/>
the cafe and have a snack - make a day of it! Then take all the <br/>
stuff home and let her use it at will. If she does it all in one <br/>
day, okay. If she does two pages and then it sits on the shelf, <br/>
okay. If she does one page a week for a few months, okay. If she <br/>
gets them home and doesn&#39;t touch them, sell them on ebay or <br/>
vegsource in a year or two (with her okay that she&#39;s not needing <br/>
them at that point). It may simply be that she needs to &#39;prove&#39; to <br/>
herself she could do it IF she wanted to. Kind of like it took a <br/>
couple of bedtime reading sessions with the Bob books to convince DS <br/>
that he could read. Once he saw that what he was doing was indeed <br/>
reading, he dropped them and moved on to more interesting stuff.<br/>

They look schooly.  First you list words then fill in the blanks.  If she<br/>
plays them all the time for fun that probably won&#39;t work. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

informative and entertaining.<br/>
