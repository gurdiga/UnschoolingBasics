<div id="ygrps-yiv-45200394">Can you recommend some books, links, or resources that are <br/>
unschooling friendly for dealing with these rages?  Some people <br/>
assume the child is acting out behavior modeled by parents, some are <br/>
happy to tell you the child needs more discipline and heavy-<br/>
handed &quot;consequences,&quot; some are sure the child needs medication, some <br/>
think you&#39;re raising the next serial killer, some will tell you that <br/>
more religious teachings are needed, and some will assume that the <br/>
whole family is out of control and plain hopeless.  What others think <br/>
is not what&#39;s important, of course, but it goes to my question about <br/>
how to handle raging children in a mindful unschooling-friendly way <br/>
(and yes, especially in public where the &quot;public&quot; seems to think they <br/>
need to give you their opinion).<br/>

&gt; I need to clarify this statement I made...I was speaking directly to<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One person&#39;s rage is another&#39;s angry frustration but if you mean rage  <br/>
the way others have meant out of control, over the top response you  <br/>
might want to check into allergies. If you search the archives of the  <br/>
list, the topic has come up several times and there&#39;s quite a bit of  <br/>
information.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1222909629">I don&#39;t remember you stating what sex/age your child is - and I&#39;m not able to get back to the email easily.  So I&#39;ll just share:  <br/>
<br/>
1) I have three 15yo boys that live around me, one of which is mine.  Each one began having rages around the ages of 10-12 and lasting until ages 13-15.  With each of them, hormonal shifts were the initiating cause; but each case was exacerbated by situational difficulties such as a father not being present in the home, diagnosed psychological problems, or fighting parents.<br/>
<br/>
I can see a boy going through these ages but having no situational circumstances but having extreme rages if he has never experienced a lot of anger, so he doesn&#39;t know what to do with it.  Or there can even be secondary circumstances that are not clear.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, if hormones are the initial cause all you can do is keep on providing a good role model, talk calmly to him if you have to at all during one of those rages, and wait until he gets older.  Also, if he destroys something during a rage, no one should fix it or clean it up but him. That&#39;s not punishment or coercion, it&#39;s life - you are responsible to clean up your own messes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2) My 11yo daughter and I have difficulties with hypoglycemia.  If we do not eat every 3-4 hours, the blood sugar drops WAY down and one of the symptoms of hypoglycemia is irritability - only with my daughter it shows as unreasonable displays of anger and rage.  Even when she knows her blood sugar is low, she will, in a rage, refuse to eat anything that will help her (as in NOT candy), as well as throw things, scream and cry, etc.; she&#39;s totally unreasonable.<br/>
<br/>
The solution here is reminding her to eat in a timely manner, and offering her something with a sugar, protein combination when she starts getting cranky.  If she gets to the rage stage, we remove the audience by sending her to her room, or going where she&#39;s not present, and letting her get it out of her system.  Eventually she knuckles under to what her body is trying to tell her and will get something to eat.<br/>

cranky either because it&#39;s directly affecting my mood or because I&#39;m  <br/>
so tired of being tired. I get more easily overwhelmed. A couple of  <br/>
weeks ago, I tripped over a bin of Legos and spilled them all over  <br/>
the living room floor. I kept walking, because I needed to pee and I  <br/>
also needed a couple of minutes to chill out or the spilled Legos  <br/>
were going to send me around the bend in a straw-that-broke-the- <br/>
camel&#39;s-back kind of way. When I came back into the living room a  <br/>
couple of minutes later, I found my 5-year-old and my 3-year-old just  <br/>
putting the last of the Legos back into the bin. &quot;We helped oo,  <br/>
Mama,&quot; my 3-year-old said, and then they ran off to play.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, my five-year-old and I will discuss what kind of family we  <br/>
want to have, when we&#39;re struggling. &quot;Do we want to have a family  <br/>
where people don&#39;t help each other?&quot; we&#39;ll say, and we agree that we  <br/>
don&#39;t want that kind of family. It helps _both_ of us be more  <br/>
flexible and loving with each other. I think we would agree that we  <br/>
don&#39;t want a family where each person has to deal with all of her own  <br/>
mistakes all by herself.<br/>

We also help each other when accidents happen but if a child delibrately goes to throw something or in our case push everything off the table or dump out box of markers then I say &quot;you make the mess you clean it up&quot;.

<br/>
But unless the advice jives with the philosophy of unschooling and <br/>
gentle, mindful parenting (that children are born learners and that we <br/>
should be their partners, not their adversaries), that &quot;advice&quot; will be <br/>
challenged and better advice given.<br/>
<br/>
Telling a child, &quot;You made the mess, YOU clean it up!&quot; isn&#39;t meeting <br/>
the child Where He Is Right Now, nor is it understanding that he needs <br/>
MORE tools, not fewer.<br/>
<br/>
No child *wants* to be angry and frustrated: he *wants* to be calm and <br/>
happy. When he&#39;s not (due to things beyond his immediate control), he <br/>
may lash out. Punishing him by making him &quot;Clean that mess up!&quot; will <br/>
not be the best way to get him to a calm and happy state. He didn&#39;t <br/>
*want* to be angry and destructive, he just had no other tools. <br/>
Punishing him for the lack of tools will only make him disrespectful <br/>
and resentful ...and probably angrier.<br/>
<br/>
My goal is to help him learn how to handle anger. Making him angrier <br/>
doesn&#39;t do that. Helping him clean up the mess he made while talking <br/>
about how frustrating it can be to be eight or twelve or 39 *can*. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
I can also use that time to let him know how much I love him even when <br/>
he&#39;s so angry, and we can talk about what&#39;s making him angry and about <br/>
other ways to deal with his anger.<br/>
<br/>
Although your advice would be accepted on a mainstream, conventional <br/>
parenting e-list, I *do* find your &quot;advice&quot; out of line with the goals <br/>
of this list.<br/>

If a &quot;good friend&quot; of mine repeatedly treated me the way most parents <br/>
treat their kids, I&#39;d have a hard time keeping friendships. Most <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;d sincerely hope a friend would *help* me when I&#39;m angry and <br/>
frustrated and melting down. I would hope she wouldn&#39;t send me to <br/>
another room to cool off and &quot;knuckle down&quot; or tell me to clean up my <br/>
own mess. I would hope she would comfort me and help me.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s unhealthy to think that punishments result in positive <br/>
feelings towards the punisher.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s very wise advice to suggest that we treat our children as <br/>
we wish we had been treated when we were children.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1200311042"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Re: But unless the advice jives with the philosophy of unschooling <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and gentle, mindful parenting (that children are born learners and <br/>
that we should be their partners, not their adversaries), <br/>
that &quot;advice&quot; will be challenged and better advice given.&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Since my methods have worked to produce two happy and healthy <br/>
children, I can&#39;t see that anyone would have *better* &quot;advice.&quot;  I <br/>
would agree, though, that different families with different <br/>
personalities and situations might need different advice from what <br/>
one person offers.  That is why I offer, from my own experience, what <br/>
has worked for me.  It&#39;s just an option for someone to consider.<br/>
<br/>
Viewing a mess that someone makes as his/hers to clean up does not <br/>
fall outside the borders of gentle, mindful parenting.  I never said <br/>
you had to be ugly about it, like some of the sample quotes <br/>
indicated.  You just start early with picking up toys with your child <br/>
and grow into an understanding that my mess is mine to clean up and <br/>
your mess is yours.  But that doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t help each other.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Telling a child, &quot;You made the mess, YOU clean it up!&quot; isn&#39;t <br/>
 </span></blockquote>meeting the child Where He Is Right Now, nor is it understanding that <br/>
he needs MORE tools, not fewer.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;No child *wants* to be angry and frustrated: he *wants* to be calm <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and happy. When he&#39;s not (due to things beyond his immediate <br/>
control), he may lash out. Punishing him by making him &quot;Clean that <br/>
mess up!&quot; will not be the best way to get him to a calm and happy <br/>
state. He didn&#39;t *want* to be angry and destructive, he just had no <br/>
other tools.&lt;&lt; <br/>
<br/>
Of course children do not want to feel angry and distressed.  And <br/>
many adults don&#39;t even have tools to handle it, so why would anyone <br/>
expect a child to?<br/>
<br/>
I never said or intimated that a child be *required* to clean up a <br/>
mess they made while they are still in the midst of an emotional <br/>
storm. Nor should they be told (because it&#39;s ugly), &quot;You know you&#39;re <br/>
going to have to clean that up later.  It&#39;s your mess, you have to <br/>
clean it up.&quot;  That, as you pointed out, would only exacerbate the <br/>
anger.<br/>
<br/>
I did not indicate that a child should be punished at all for an <br/>
outburst of anger.  I said that no one else should clean up his <br/>
mess.  I never even said that he should be *told* to clean up the <br/>
mess because he made it.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Punishing him for the lack of tools will only make him <br/>
 </span></blockquote>disrespectful and resentful ...and probably angrier.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree.  That&#39;s why I didn&#39;t mention punishing the child.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;My goal is to help him learn how to handle anger.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mine, too!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Making him angrier doesn&#39;t do that.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sometimes there comes a point when anything you do or don&#39;t do makes <br/>
the child angrier.  By handling your own intense emotions in a <br/>
productive way, you are role modeling a tool the child can learn.  <br/>
Going into another room, when my daughter is raging and even looking <br/>
at me makes her scream more, is productive.  It gets at least one <br/>
source of frustration out of her way for a while.  It isn&#39;t <br/>
abandonment.  She knows I&#39;m there.  She knows she&#39;s welcome if she <br/>
wants me, or that I will go right to her if she calls.  If the <br/>
separation becomes irrelevant, or causes further distress, of course <br/>
I respond to her need for support.<br/>
<br/>
And every time she gets through something like that we don&#39;t have <br/>
a &quot;you-shouldn&#39;t-act-like-that&quot; talk.  I just ask, &quot;Do you feel <br/>
better?&quot; and &quot;Do you want something to eat?&quot; and take cues from her <br/>
about what to talk about from that point.  Usually she ends up asking <br/>
questions (that I&#39;ve answered a thousand times) about hypoglycemia <br/>
and managing it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Helping him clean up the mess he made while talking about how <br/>
 </span></blockquote>frustrating it can be to be eight or twelve or 39 *can*. &lt;g&gt; &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I can also use that time to let him know how much I love him even <br/>
 </span></blockquote>when he&#39;s so angry, and we can talk about what&#39;s making him angry and <br/>
about other ways to deal with his anger.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I certainly agree that assisting him to clean up the mess shows <br/>
grace, and love and provides an excellant opportunity for <br/>
constructive conversation.  I&#39;ve done that many times.  But it&#39;s <br/>
still not my mess to clean up, I help because I have love for my <br/>
child.  Many times my son would quietly clean up the mess without <br/>
even letting me know.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Although your advice would be accepted on a mainstream, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>conventional parenting e-list, I *do* find your &quot;advice&quot; out of line <br/>
with the goals of this list.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I feel that some assumptions were made about me and my parenting that <br/>
are not true.  Perhaps, in trying to keep my post to a reasonable <br/>
length I left too many questions open about how we do things around <br/>
here.  I would welcome the opportunity to clarify anything I post, if <br/>
needed, rather than endure being told publicly that my parenting is <br/>
not appropriate, when it is appropriate and effective.  I suppose <br/>
*if* I post again I will not worry about the length of the post.  <br/>
I&#39;ll just write and write and make sure nothing is left open to <br/>
assumption.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also confused about the name of this list &quot;Unschoolingbasics&quot; and <br/>
the expectation that everyone will be well versed in the philosophies <br/>
of John Holt and gentle, mindful parenting?  The basics part makes me <br/>
think it&#39;s for beginners.  Is it not?  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Once again, I must point out that since my children are thriving and <br/>
happy and learning, I must be doing something right.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-509406946">Well, now I feel I must point out that there are kids in school that <br/>
are thriving and happy and learning.  There are parents who had a <br/>
first child who was thriving with conventional parenting, parents <br/>
who <br/>
thought they were doing everything right, and then a second child <br/>
came <br/>
along who did not respond at all the same.  But this list is not <br/>
going <br/>
to recommend school just because some kids are happy there, or say <br/>
that time-outs are okay because some kids seem fine with them.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s always a good thing to examine what we do as parents.  <br/>
Even if our kids are happy, that doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t improve in <br/>
certain areas and make our lives even more great.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1400053088">~~This is soo true I had to do it with my raging 2 yr old- she makes<br/>
the mess while mad she she has to clean it up. It has helped a lot~~<br/>
<br/>
Helped how? Helped her trust that you&#39;re there for her, even when<br/>
she&#39;s having a difficult moment? Helped her stop the behavior because<br/>
it&#39;s more convenient for the parent? Sure. It&#39;s not helping your<br/>
relationship with her though. She now knows that she&#39;s on her own if<br/>
she&#39;s having a particularly rough time. That&#39;s too bad.<br/>
<br/>
Two year olds have VERY few tools. I am surprised that any two year<br/>
old would be expected to clean up any kind of mess on their own unless<br/>
they wanted to. That&#39;s heavy expectation.<br/>
<br/>
I would help my teen clean up if he had a rage...though I know NOTHING<br/>
of raging teens since both my teens are very happy, even-keeled human<br/>
beings. I would much rather know that my loved ones are there for me,<br/>
even when I have a rough moment. It would make me really sad if<br/>
someone said &quot;you made the mess, you clean it up&quot; regardless of what<br/>
caused the mess.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad we just help each other around here, it&#39;s made for better<br/>

they need help.<br/>

If that&#39;s as far as a person wants to take it, then they might not be<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
How is it mindful or respectful to leave someone that needs help? If<br/>
they child wants to clean it up on their own, then that isn&#39;t an<br/>
issue. But if the parent decides for the child that they will clean it<br/>
up because it&#39;s THEIR mess, then it does become punishment. And<br/>
punishing other human beings isn&#39;t mindful in my book. It&#39;s coercion<br/>
and not at all gentle.<br/>
<br/>
Here is some information on mindfulness: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness</a><br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.parentcoachinginstitute.com/articles/normand_MindfulParenting.html">http://www.parentcoachinginstitute.com/articles/normand_MindfulParenting.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Mindfulness has such meaning, but most of all it means being fully<br/>
present in the moment. When I am fully present for my child, there is<br/>
no judgement of who deserves to clean up a mess or placing blame on<br/>
anyone or anything. When I am fully present, I can simply be in the<br/>
moment, noticing both my feelings and the situation. I can choose<br/>
actions more clearly in that place of being fully present.<br/>
<br/>
When we see our children as human beings doing the very best they can<br/>
in each and every moment, it frees us to be their partners without<br/>
judgement, without guilt or blame or punishment of any kind. Thats a<br/>
good place to be. <br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, whose mess it is no longer matters at all and one can act<br/>
with compassion.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t remember you stating what sex/age your child is - and I&#39;m <br/>
not able to get back to the email easily.  So I&#39;ll just share:  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1) I have three 15yo boys that live around me, one of which is <br/>
mine.  Each one began having rages around the ages of 10-12 and <br/>
lasting until ages 13-15.  With each of them, hormonal shifts were <br/>
the initiating cause; but each case was exacerbated by situational <br/>
difficulties such as a father not being present in the home, <br/>
diagnosed psychological problems, or fighting parents.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I can see a boy going through these ages but having no situational <br/>
circumstances but having extreme rages if he has never experienced a <br/>
lot of anger, so he doesn&#39;t know what to do with it.  Or there can <br/>
even be secondary circumstances that are not clear.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Unfortunately, if hormones are the initial cause all you can do is <br/>
keep on providing a good role model, talk calmly to him if you have <br/>
to at all during one of those rages, and wait until he gets older.  <br/>
Also, if he destroys something during a rage, no one should fix it or <br/>
clean it up but him. That&#39;s not punishment or coercion, it&#39;s life - <br/>
you are responsible to clean up your own messes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2) My 11yo daughter and I have difficulties with hypoglycemia.  If <br/>
we do not eat every 3-4 hours, the blood sugar drops WAY down and one <br/>
of the symptoms of hypoglycemia is irritability - only with my <br/>
daughter it shows as unreasonable displays of anger and rage.  Even <br/>
when she knows her blood sugar is low, she will, in a rage, refuse to <br/>
eat anything that will help her (as in NOT candy), as well as throw <br/>
things, scream and cry, etc.; she&#39;s totally unreasonable.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The solution here is reminding her to eat in a timely manner, and <br/>
offering her something with a sugar, protein combination when she <br/>
starts getting cranky.  If she gets to the rage stage, we remove the <br/>
audience by sending her to her room, or going where she&#39;s not <br/>
present, and letting her get it out of her system.  Eventually she <br/>
knuckles under to what her body is trying to tell her and will get <br/>
something to eat.<br/>

I don&#39;t send her (BTW she&#39;s 11yo) to her room as in &quot;Go to your <br/>

anything, when even looking at me (or her dad or her brother) sends <br/>
her into new heights of screaming and raging, I say, &quot;Would you like <br/>
to go to your room?&quot;  Sometimes, she does, sometimes, she doesn&#39;t.  <br/>
If she doesn&#39;t. I will go into another room.  But I can always hear <br/>
her if she calls me, and she&#39;s welcome to come to me when she wants <br/>
to, but when she reaches that certain point where her family members <br/>
just make it worse, it&#39;s kinder to separate from her and allow her <br/>
calm down a bit.<br/>
<br/>
THEN when she&#39;s asking for me, or comes to the room where I am, she&#39;s <br/>
able to benefit from interacting with me.  Sometimes she still <br/>
refuses food at that point, but as long as my presence isn&#39;t causing <br/>
her MORE distress, I&#39;m right there with her.<br/>

And we don&#39;t just carry on family activities without like she&#39;s <br/>
missing out because she&#39;s acting up.  I&#39;ll guarantee you everything <br/>
comes to a standstill when she is in this state.  Granted, her <br/>

it too (and at least part-way enjoy it).<br/>

hormonal changes and hypoglycemia can cause rages.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-19735016">Tell me what you would do with a 2 yr old who when she did not get her way she would either walk away and over to the table and throw anything on it off to the floor and then stand back and say &quot;hen&quot;. Very limited speech. or she would dump out the containers of whatever is closest (markers, toys, food). <br/>
<br/>
Is the answer to give everything she wants? I find that it is this child who moves me to saying yes and finding a way to make it work BUT there are still times when she simply does not get her way when she wants it. <br/>
<br/>
suggestions would be nice from people who HAVE had a raging child and how they handle it<br/>

  ~~This is soo true I had to do it with my raging 2 yr old- she makes<br/>
  the mess while mad she she has to clean it up. It has helped a lot~~<br/>
<br/>
  Helped how? Helped her trust that you&#39;re there for her, even when<br/>
  she&#39;s having a difficult moment? Helped her stop the behavior because<br/>
  it&#39;s more convenient for the parent? Sure. It&#39;s not helping your<br/>
  relationship with her though. She now knows that she&#39;s on her own if<br/>
  she&#39;s having a particularly rough time. That&#39;s too bad.<br/>
<br/>
  Two year olds have VERY few tools. I am surprised that any two year<br/>
  old would be expected to clean up any kind of mess on their own unless<br/>
  they wanted to. That&#39;s heavy expectation.<br/>
<br/>
  I would help my teen clean up if he had a rage...though I know NOTHING<br/>
  of raging teens since both my teens are very happy, even-keeled human<br/>
  beings. I would much rather know that my loved ones are there for me,<br/>
  even when I have a rough moment. It would make me really sad if<br/>
  someone said &quot;you made the mess, you clean it up&quot; regardless of what<br/>
  caused the mess.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m glad we just help each other around here, it&#39;s made for better<br/>
  relationships and a much happier family. Nobody is on their own when<br/>
  they need help.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The list *exists* to influence others&#39; parenting :-) to help other  <br/>
parents apply the principles of trust and respect to parenting.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike most lists that discuss parenting, this list isn&#39;t about  <br/>
people sharing &quot;what works for us&quot;. It&#39;s about helping families form  <br/>
better relationships so their children can learn and grow.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about helping parents apply the principles of trust and respect.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to look at conventional parenting objectively. It&#39;s what  <br/>
(seemingly) everyone who has decent kids does. But conventional  <br/>
parenting also turns out criminals and keeps therapists and self-help  <br/>
writers in business. So it feels like parenting is a crap shoot and  <br/>
you do the best you can.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny that when conventional parents claim their kids are loving  <br/>
and kind and so forth, and then dig deep to explain what they&#39;re  <br/>
doing with their kids beyond the punishment, it always turns out that  <br/>
in addition to conventional parenting, they&#39;re connecting and bonding  <br/>
with their kids through dialog, actually listening to their kids  <br/>
rather than talking at them.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the relationship that&#39;s allowing conventional parenting to work,  <br/>
not the conventional parenting itself. Because if it was conventional  <br/>
parenting that worked it would always turn out great kids. But it  <br/>
doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
We just skip the conventional parenting and go for the part that  <br/>
works! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Parents can do better than a crap shoot by applying the principles  <br/>
that help humans thrive: love, trust, respect, partnership.<br/>
<br/>
Most parents would claim they do that. But in conventional parenting  <br/>
those principles are far down the list of what&#39;s important. The  <br/>
underlying principle of conventional parenting is getting the child  <br/>
to behave in ways the parents feel is acceptable to create kids who  <br/>
are happy, healthy and thoughtful. Parents may employ what feels to  <br/>
the parent like love and respect in their molding but the goal is  <br/>
improving the child&#39;s behavior, getting the child to think in the  <br/>
right way: stop the raging, stop the tantrums, do their chores, clean  <br/>
up after themselves, say please and thank you, close the door, come  <br/>
home on time and so on and so on.<br/>
<br/>
If we applied the goals and techniques of conventional parenting to  <br/>
any other relationship we wouldn&#39;t have relationships at all!  <br/>
Conventional parenting is so disrespectful of children, that it&#39;s a  <br/>
testament to the parent child bond that it ever works at all.<br/>
<br/>
At the foundation of conventional parenting is the idea: &quot;I know a  <br/>
better way for you to be and I&#39;m going to employ various techniques  <br/>
until you catch on.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
At the foundation of mindful parenting is the idea: &quot;I know you&#39;re  <br/>
doing the best you can. Let&#39;s see if we can figure out together an  <br/>
even better way to get what you want.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Kids don&#39;t want to rage. They don&#39;t want to hit each other. But they  <br/>
do want to get their needs met. And mindful  parenting focuses on  <br/>
being the child&#39;s partner in finding a better way to meet their needs  <br/>
without stepping on other&#39;s toes.<br/>
<br/>
Mindful parenting is about assuming that kids don&#39;t want to do wrong  <br/>
things.  Mindful parents assume kids want to be kind and thoughtful  <br/>
but just don&#39;t have the knowledge, skills or understanding to do so  <br/>
always. We help them, and trust that they&#39;re doing the best they can.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I was not clear, and you, and others, misunderstood.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>On this list we need to be as crystal clear as we possibly can about  <br/>
what part of what we&#39;re doing is working. &quot;This works for us,&quot; isn&#39;t  <br/>
good enough. Analyzing why it works and what the underlying  <br/>
principles are that are working will help others.<br/>
<br/>
As a general rule &quot;Go to your room,&quot; or even &quot;Would you like to go to  <br/>
your room?&quot; are not techniques that any parent can pick up and apply  <br/>
at home to see if they work.<br/>
<br/>
Sending a child away isn&#39;t what&#39;s working. Helping a child get what  <br/>
she needs does work. You may have come to a mutual understanding with  <br/>
your daughter that asking her if she&#39;d like to be away from people is  <br/>
what she as a unique individual needs. But it&#39;s meeting her needs  <br/>
that worked, not sending her to her room that works.<br/>
<br/>
Does the distinction make sense?<br/>
<br/>
On  this list we help parents figure out how to meet their kids  <br/>
needs, not hand them conventional parenting techniques (eg, sending a  <br/>
child to her room or even *asking* a child if she wants to go to her  <br/>
room).<br/>

OK---Hormonal changes and hypoglycemia can cause rages. So can food <br/>
allergies. So can over-tiredness. So can a lot of things. That doesn&#39;t <br/>
make abandonment or punishment the cure.<br/>
<br/>
Your response was more focussed on what to do to the child if these <br/>
things were the cause. So your post *seemed* to point out what you <br/>
believe to think is a good way to deal with the rages. I don&#39;t agree <br/>
that they are particularly *good* ways to deal with the rages. I know <br/>
better ways. And I don&#39;t want new readers to think that this list <br/>
advocates such tactics with children.<br/>

How? Have you told them she must be asked whether she&#39;d like to go to <br/>
her room? Or that everyone should leave the room she&#39;s in? Camp, with <br/>
its late nights and early mornings and rigid eating schedule (and often <br/>
the children aren&#39;t allowed to bring outside food), is a rough place to <br/>
be when you&#39;re raging due to hypoglycemia.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>*Why* is she deliberately throwing and creating the mess?<br/>
<br/>
That, for mindful parenting purposes, is where to begin problem solving.<br/>
<br/>
Conventional parenting begins with the action as the problem and  <br/>
tries to change the action. Which is why it seems to make sense to  <br/>
present a child&#39;s behavior and describe how to respond when a child  <br/>
does that.<br/>
<br/>
Mindful parenting begins with the reasons behind the action and helps  <br/>
the child find a better way to meet her needs.  A dozen children  <br/>
throwing things and pushing things off the table would have a dozen  <br/>
reasons for doing it. One child might have a dozen different reasons  <br/>
for the dozen times they&#39;ve done it. It doesn&#39;t make sense to respond  <br/>
to them all the same. (One reason might be that it&#39;s fun. :-) And if  <br/>
it&#39;s fun, why be the fun police? Join in! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Kids don&#39;t want to hurt others but when they feel they need to fight  <br/>
to get their needs met then they will resort to means that head  <br/>
straight to what they want because they don&#39;t yet have the skills and  <br/>
perhaps not the mental development to weigh all the pros and cons of  <br/>
their options.<br/>
<br/>
If she needs something then she&#39;s trying to communicate that and  <br/>
either doesn&#39;t know how or the parent hasn&#39;t been picking up her  <br/>
signals and she needed to resort to something dramatic to get the  <br/>
parent to pay attention.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s just the general ideas behind mindful parenting. It doesn&#39;t  <br/>
specifically address the behavior you described because you haven&#39;t  <br/>
told us the reasons.<br/>

Since my methods have worked to produce two happy and healthy<br/>

would agree, though, that different families with different<br/>
personalities and situations might need different advice from what<br/>
one person offers.  That is why I offer, from my own experience, what<br/>
has worked for me.  It&#39;s just an option for someone to consider.<br/>

My parents, from their own experience, believe that spankings worked <br/>
for them. They believe it&#39;s an option for others to consider too. Their <br/>
methods produced two, what they considered, happy and healthy children <br/>
too. But the rage I still feel about the spankings---well, I&#39;m still <br/>

-=-===-=-<br/>
<br/>
 You just start early with picking up toys with your child<br/>
and grow into an understanding that my mess is mine to clean up and<br/>
your mess is yours.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
When you&#39;re 80 and having trouble cleaning your own messes, I hope that <br/>
is not the attitude your children take.<br/>
<br/>
-==-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I never said or intimated that a child be *required* to clean up a<br/>
mess they made while they are still in the midst of an emotional<br/>
storm.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
But later&#39;s OK. How&#39;s that *not* punishment?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I did not indicate that a child should be punished at all for an<br/>
outburst of anger.  I said that no one else should clean up his<br/>
mess.  I never even said that he should be *told* to clean up the<br/>
mess because he made it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
How would he know he&#39;s supposed to if he&#39;s not told to? Years and years <br/>
of practice?<br/>
<br/>
Or do you just leave it there (since no one else should clean it up)? <br/>
How long is it allowed to stay there? Does he have a choice to clean up <br/>
or not?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Punishing him for the lack of tools will only make him<br/>
 </span></blockquote>disrespectful and resentful ...and probably angrier.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree.  That&#39;s why I didn&#39;t mention punishing the child.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-==-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you&#39;d like to define punishment?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I feel that some assumptions were made about me and my parenting that<br/>
are not true.  Perhaps, in trying to keep my post to a reasonable<br/>
length I left too many questions open about how we do things around<br/>
here.  I would welcome the opportunity to clarify anything I post, if<br/>
needed, rather than endure being told publicly that my parenting is<br/>
not appropriate, when it is appropriate and effective.  I suppose<br/>
*if* I post again I will not worry about the length of the post.<br/>
I&#39;ll just write and write and make sure nothing is left open to<br/>
assumption.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yes, we made assumptions---some you&#39;re still proving were correct.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not necessary to &quot;write and write&quot; if you can be clear the first <br/>
time. If your intent were to simply say that hormones and hypoglycemia <br/>
may cause raging, maybe you could have stopped there; but you continued <br/>
to say how you dealt with the rages. THAT is what we&#39;re challenging.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also confused about the name of this list &quot;Unschoolingbasics&quot; and<br/>
the expectation that everyone will be well versed in the philosophies<br/>
of John Holt and gentle, mindful parenting?  The basics part makes me<br/>
think it&#39;s for beginners.  Is it not?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
We certainly don&#39;t believe that everyone will be &quot;well versed in the <br/>
philosophies of John Holt and gentle, mindful parenting.&quot; In fact, we <br/>
assume most folks will *not* be, so we spend a lot of time trying to <br/>
explain what they are. Having conflicting advice doesn&#39;t further our <br/>
goal of guiding folks TO unschooling and mindful parenting. Had I let <br/>
your advice stand unchallenged, someone may have thought---&quot;Oh! That&#39;s <br/>
OK too!---and easier! I&#39;ll do that!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You were writing about what works for you---not necessariily what works <br/>
for your children. I don&#39;t think that your advice was an example of <br/>
gentle, mindful parenting.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Once again, I must point out that since my children are thriving and<br/>
happy and learning, I must be doing something right.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
You know, that was EXACTLY what my mother said earlier this month on <br/>
Mother&#39;s Day: she must&#39;ve done something right. I just had to shake my <br/>
head---she really thinks that her parenting was good. Why? Because I <br/>
haven&#39;t committed suicide and I&#39;m not in prison???<br/>
<br/>
We can be better parents. Each and every day.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, she doesn&#39;t have to. You choose to make her. You choose to model  <br/>
for her that when you&#39;re big and strong and don&#39;t like what someone  <br/>
weaker than you is doing, you can make them do whatever you want.<br/>
<br/>
Teachers believe they teach children to read too. But what happens is  <br/>
that kids get older and they reach the point where they would  <br/>
naturally have figured out reading during the time they&#39;re being taught.<br/>
<br/>
If teaching was necessary, then unschooled kids would never read.<br/>
<br/>
If making a child clean up a mess was necessary to stop the behavior,  <br/>
then mindful parenting wouldn&#39;t work. Kids would still be throwing  <br/>
things as teens.<br/>
<br/>
Kids *can* learn through punishment. They can learn to avoid certain  <br/>
behaviors. But there are relationship-damaging consequences that we  <br/>
take the chance of happening when we use punishment.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s not something you would do with a friend, if it&#39;s something  <br/>
you fear might harm a friendship, why would you use it on a child who  <br/>
trust you?<br/>
<br/>
There *are* ways to help kids meet their needs that enhance  <br/>
relationships *and* help them gain skills to meet their needs in ways  <br/>
that don&#39;t harm others. Those are the ideas we help people with on  <br/>
this particular list. There are thousands of lists and websites where  <br/>
parents can go to find out how to make their children do what the  <br/>
parents believe is best. On this particular one we help parents help  <br/>
their children and help them build relationships *and* have happy,  <br/>
healthy, thoughtful children.<br/>
<br/>
None of what we say and do will make sense if  you feel what you&#39;re  <br/>
doing works. This list is for people who&#39;ve been there and done that  <br/>
and want something the feel is better. So conventional parenting  <br/>
practices will be held up and examined for the effect they have on  <br/>
relationships and ways that will work that don&#39;t tear down  <br/>
relationships will be offered instead.<br/>
