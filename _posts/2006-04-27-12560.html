<div id="ygrps-yiv-14114727">I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve sent an introduction to the group though I&#39;ve <br/>
been reading for a few weeks.  My name is Beth.  I live in Georgia <br/>
with my husband and 3 children.  My oldest daughter is almost 14 and <br/>
attends public school.  I homeschool my ds9 and dd8.  We&#39;ve <br/>
homeschooled 4+ years.  We started out very traditional then moved <br/>
into unschooling.  Unfortunately, we&#39;ve bounced between methods <br/>
and/or philosophies for various [silly] reasons.  We were relaxed <br/>
schoolers most recently, using a literature based program.  I then <br/>
dropped the schedule and we&#39;ve just been reading for enjoyment.  We <br/>
took a week off and just haven&#39;t wanted to go back to anything <br/>
formal.  I got out my unschooling books and have been rethinking my <br/>
position on education and goals for my children.  I believe we have <br/>
problems with formal, structured programs because we are unschoolers <br/>
at heart.  So I&#39;m trying to turn over a new leaf and have asked my <br/>
children to partner with me so we can all be happy again.  They are <br/>
definitely on board.  They&#39;ve promised that if I start going down <br/>
that &#39;schoolish&#39; path again, they&#39;ll let me know.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve stayed away from formal schoolish things for a couple of <br/>
months now and we&#39;re all feeling pretty good.  I can&#39;t remember when <br/>
I have felt more relaxed!  As a former curriculum junkie, I thought <br/>
kicking the habit would be difficult.  But so far I&#39;m doing really <br/>
great.  The kids are pursuing their interests and leading the way.  <br/>
I&#39;ve joined several new yahoo groups looking for support so I don&#39;t <br/>
fall back into old habits.  :)<br/>
