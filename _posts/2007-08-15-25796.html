<div id="ygrps-yiv-279238620">Hello all -<br/>
I&#39;ve been a lurker on this list, but I&#39;m pretty sure mine is a<br/>
question which has not been asked.  First, a little history -<br/>
<br/>
The 2006-7 school year was our first for unschooling our 1,7 & 9<br/>
year-olds.  But for the older two, I had the spectre of an unbelieving<br/>
and uninformed, controlling ex-husband hanging over our heads.  His<br/>
insistance that they had to pass a standardized test at the end of the<br/>
year haunted and soured our entire experience last year.  Both<br/>
children passed the CAT with flying colors... except my 9-year-old,<br/>
who tested below grade level in math (because this child refused to<br/>
have anything to do with it).  <br/>
<br/>
For the 2007-8 school year, my husband was able to get a verbal<br/>
agreement from the ex to let us try it &quot;one more year.&quot;  I hate this<br/>
meted out permission, and all feelings of still having my life and my<br/>
children under the control of someone who understands none of it. <br/>
We&#39;re planning to branch out into some community activities, namely<br/>
scouts and  civic theatre.<br/>
<br/>
But here&#39;s my question:  Are my kids just REALLY weird or am I doing<br/>
something wrong?  All three of them seem intensely interested in<br/>
anything that I am learning.  If I&#39;m paying bills or doing geneology<br/>
or watching a documentary, that&#39;s where they want to be, like 3 little<br/>
ducks in a row, my velcro shadows.  They don&#39;t like playing outside at<br/>
all, and it&#39;s hard to persuade them to go there.  Yet when my husband<br/>
or I are out watering the garden or doing the composting or<br/>
vermiculture, boom - there they are.  More beloved than the outdoors<br/>
is the television.  If they could get away with it, they would watch<br/>
TV all day.  It appears to my husband that all they really do is play<br/>
and read books and mess up the house.  What&#39;s frustrating for me is<br/>
that I thought they would take off with interests of their own, not<br/>
grasp onto MY interests as tightly or tighter than I do.  Sometimes I<br/>
feel a little suffocated by that, and other times I worry that they<br/>
are not &quot;blossoming&quot;, &quot;branching out&quot; or &quot;exploring their own<br/>
interests&quot; like it seems everyone else&#39;s unschool children do.<br/>
<br/>
You have to understand that I don&#39;t know what NORMAL is - both for<br/>
what is normal for public school life AND for unschooled life.  My 5<br/>
siblings and I were raised in an EXTREMELY controlling and unhappy<br/>
home, attending public schools and doing well academically but not<br/>
being allowed to have any friends or fun outside of class.  We owned a<br/>
family business and it was work, work, work.  I won&#39;t force my<br/>
children to work so maybe that&#39;s why the bathroom goes for weeks<br/>
without a scrubdown... but my children actually volunteer to do it,<br/>
and seem to have a ball (don&#39;t worry - we use safe cleaning products -<br/>
Vinegar and Young Living&#39;s  Theives).  I am flabbergasted when my<br/>
children take the initiative like this. I guess I&#39;m worried, though,<br/>
that there seems to be no initiative academically.  No devouring of<br/>
books about horses, dinosaurs, Ben Franklin, or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Help!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-434718870">Right now it sounds like they are trying desperately to *connect* with<br/>
you. That is entirely Normal (whatever Normal is exactly lol). What&#39;s<br/>
wrong with them being interested in paying bills, gardening, or<br/>
whatever? Turn your thinking around a bit: if they expressed an interest<br/>
independently of vermiculture (That&#39;s such a cool word to start with!),<br/>
wouldn&#39;t you think &quot;Great, let&#39;s see how we can get that going&quot;? So, why<br/>
is it that you have a problem with them spending time with BOTH<br/>
vermiculture AND you? Think of all the families who rarely ever see each<br/>
other and the parents who one day wish &quot;Gee I wish my kids and I spent<br/>
more time together&quot; You&#39;ve GOT that - enjoy! Sooner or later they will<br/>
branch out BUT for now they need TIME with YOU. Most of &quot;everyone else&#39;s<br/>
kids&quot; have been FREE a lot longer than yours. Basically, they&#39;re<br/>
stocking up on Mom-time - it&#39;s a &#39;famine reaction&#39; - they were away from<br/>
you for a long time (if they just left school this past year, they were<br/>
gone for up to 4 years roughly, correct?) and the spectre of the<br/>
&#39;famine&#39; coming back (going back to school) is still hanging there, so<br/>
they are &quot;feasting&quot; on you. How about -you- branch out a bit? Go ahead<br/>
and free the TV and see what they enjoy watching then follow those<br/>
rabbit trails wherever they may lead.<br/>
 <br/>
Drop the notion of having to do &#39;academic looking&#39; stuff, learning<br/>
happens internally - you can&#39;t see it. They&#39;re learning geneology,<br/>
vermiculture, bill paying (that counts as math BTW lol), whatever<br/>
documentary stuff you&#39;re watching, and so on. How many 7 yr olds even<br/>
know what vermiculture is? That&#39;s COOL! In the process, they&#39;re also<br/>
probably reading some, calculating some, researching some, thinking a<br/>
bunch, touching on history and science, and so on. All those &quot;school<br/>
subjects&quot; are there - but they&#39;re not divided off into disembodied<br/>
things with no connection to real life. They are living life and<br/>
learning is part of that. Go enjoy it with your kids.<br/>
