<div id="ygrps-yiv-61731472">I had something happen today at Sunday School that at one time may not have<br/>
bothered me, but after researching the lifestyle of unschooling it really<br/>
bothered me.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I volunteered in the 4 year olds class-very scheduled, structured, at one<br/>
point we all went outside to let the kids play and one of the children did<br/>
not want to go outside to play-I knew once she went outside she would enjoy<br/>
the fresh air and freedom to move around, I asked the child if she wanted to<br/>
stay inside and play, the teacher looked at me and said she has NO CHOICE-so<br/>
we went outside and she did have fun.<br/>
<br/>
Then when we came inside they were given a choice of pictures  to color, as<br/>
they were coloring they were told, no you need to color it more, no do not<br/>
tap your crayons to make circles, no you can&#39;t have the cut out pumpkins<br/>
because you will color on the table, no that is NOT the color to color<br/>
with-pumpkins are orange!, <br/>
<br/>
I NEVER realized how much we as adults micromanage children&#39;s lives,<br/>
decisions, how we make them feel inferior in their choices, because we are<br/>
the adults and they do not know better.<br/>
<br/>
Just being in this class, okay sit in a circle, listen, pick up your toys<br/>
right as you are getting into pretend play, color this way, go outside, come<br/>
inside now, made me realize how much I dislike over structured &quot;learning&quot;<br/>
environments.  I have NEVER had an aha moment like the one I had today!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for the information and encouragement you provide to us<br/>
newbies who are learning how to adjust to the unschooling LIFESTYLE!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
God bless, <br/>
