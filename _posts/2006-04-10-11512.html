<div id="ygrps-yiv-1202508560">I am trying to fill out the paperwork for the state that will allow us to homeschool David next year. I have to answer the following question:<br/>
   <br/>
  Describe the skills or topics to be covered in Language Arts (Reading and Writing) in such areas as phonics, penmanship, reading skills, reading comprehension, oral reading, speaking/listening, vocabulary, spelling, grammar, usage, mechanics, written expression, compositions, editing, reference materials, reasoning and/or media, etc.<br/>
   <br/>
  Does this sound OK and appropriately &quot;unschooling&quot; yet still answer the question? David loves to read & reads constantly & loves to write stories so it&#39;s a given that he will be doing these things (at least to me).<br/>
   <br/>
  Topics covered may include but are not limited to the following:<br/>
   <br/>
  Creative writing of stories which will allow for instruction in penmanship, oral reading, speaking/listening, spelling, grammar, usage and editing.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Reading a variety of fiction and non-fiction books which will allow for instruction in reading skills, reading comprehension, and reasoning.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-992246021">--Yes!!! One thing i had to remember(and we are very, very new to unschooling) is that we <br/>
are not sure what our kids will learn, and we need to create an umbrella to &quot;protect&quot; us.  If <br/>
she reads 100 books a month(and she does) did i want to put the specifics or just say &quot;a <br/>
variety of fiction and non-fiction books will be included&quot;.  But i couldn&#39;t say she WILL read <br/>
100 books a month, because she may not.  That is what i meant by having your Minimum <br/>
Course of Study papers flexible, with unschooling you never know what they will learn.  If <br/>
you are interested i can email a copy of what i did. You can use it or totally ignore it...up to <br/>
you, let me know off list at  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:us5@...">us5@...</a><br/>
