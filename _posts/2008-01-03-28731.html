Hi All~<br/>
<br/>
I am wondering if a child who was in Daycare would go through a similar &quot;deschooling&quot; phase when out of daycare, as if they were in school? My oldest DD is 4 1/2 and even though she hasn&#39;t been in daycare since she was 3, I have been Nannying outside the home with my children for the past year and a half  and now will be home with both the girls, and working outside the home in the evenings. <br/>
<br/>
Just wondered if others have been in a similar situation? I feel like she has some things to heal from her daycare experience. And wondering if anyone has any suggestion on how to support her.<br/>
