<div id="ygrps-yiv-60018882">Another gem I stumbled on while reading an unschoolers blog...this <br/>
historical recreation is held in Muddy Run Park in PA on September 22 - <br/>
30th.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been to this park plenty of times since our family farm is just <br/>
south from it in MD.  The park is beautiful in it&#39;s own right but this <br/>
looks like an awesome learning experience for everyone.  You could <br/>
always hit Lancaster and see more sites while you&#39;re there.  Make it an <br/>
adventure!  We will :-)<br/>
