<div id="ygrps-yiv-1562525130">&quot;I still feel it is a lie on some level to<br/>
take what they are learning and make it fit state regulations. I know my<br/>
sons do too on some level. So does my family. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I guess I have a hard time understanding why anyone feels it is wrong to lie to a governmental body that has caused massive damage to a human being. Why do you feel it is necessary to play by their rules at this point?  Your children and their safety and peace are far more important than outright lying about their activities.<br/>
Not that anyone is saying to do that.<br/>
You aren&#39;t.  Fulfilling some state requirement is a mute point when you&#39;re dealing with damaged human beings, but you ARE fulfilling the requirements in a unique way.<br/>
Maybe I&#39;m going to ruffle some feathers here...I hope not, but screw the damn schools. Your kid matters more. How moral is it to allow a child to be damaged further? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1074790591">Hi<br/>
<br/>
I thikn Ren is right about this. My children - older ones were damaged by school. I have no worries whatsoever about telling the authority what they want to hear as most of what the authority want to hear is not learning and irelevant to them and their lives. E.g if you put they can play they instantly want to know what grade?  If you say they can do maths - they want to know up to what level.  It is not required here to be at any level  so I don&#39;t tell them or I tell them  what a child in school would be doing.  ( theydon&#39;t like it if they are above a perceived level either). Keeps my kids happy and them off my back and that is what counts. I look on it school had their chance and messed it up.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-810319264">Hi<br/>
<br/>
I second that.  My son&#39;s enthusiasm for learning was all but snuffed <br/>
out by the school system and I&#39;ll tell them anything they want to <br/>
hear to stay within their guidelines and keep them off my back.  I&#39;ve <br/>
been listening to them for far too long and it&#39;s proven to do nothing <br/>
but harm him, so now it&#39;s time to listen to HIM and celebrate HIS <br/>
gifts and abilities.<br/>

I especially like your last sentence Ruth!  I feel like saying that to <br/>
my daughter&#39;s school.  I spent this past year (6th grade, first-and <br/>
last- in middle school) trying to find out how they were going <br/>
to &quot;help&quot; my daughter &quot;succeed&quot; (by their standards).  I got very few <br/>
truly helpful solutions proposed by the &quot;experts and &quot;yessed&quot; to death <br/>
quit a bit to boot.  My (first time) letter or intent is going in at <br/>
the beginning of Aug - I hope it goes through.  The schools DON&#39;T see <br/>
it as possibly being something &quot;wrong&quot; with the way they&#39;re teaching, <br/>
it&#39;s that my child isn&#39;t trying hard enough or needs to do more <br/>
repetitive boring homework worksheets and assignments, or stay after <br/>
for &quot;extra help&quot; (more of the same type of &quot;teaching&quot; that isn&#39;t making <br/>
sense to her)!.........(I&#39;m done ranting......)<br/>
