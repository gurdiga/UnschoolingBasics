<div id="ygrps-yiv-879983068">Hello to all unschooler friends.  I am in dire need of some ideas.  Thought some of you might <br/>
help.  Tomorrow our school district goes back to school. I thought it would be a nifty thing if <br/>
we could do something fun to celebrate our freedom in homeschooling ... especially <br/>
unschooling.   So .. do you think for the life of me I can think of something to do in the spirit <br/>
of our freedom???  NOOOO!!  Gee whiz what&#39;s wrong with me?? I&#39;ve mentioned it to DS 15yo <br/>
and even hubby but none of us have really come up with anything much.  <br/>
<br/>
Soooo ... thought maybe some of you might have some creative ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1188048244">Here is our Not Back to School Party, but the oldest kid we have is  <br/>
fourteen, and the two teens spent most of their time on skateboards  <br/>
(although the snacks and egg smashing went over well!)<br/>

or-nbtsp.html<br/>
<br/>
If I had just one teen, I might head to the next big city over, and  <br/>
spend the night in a hotel, find some fav subject stores, eat lots of  <br/>
fav foods. I might head to the lake with my teen, to hike and fish  <br/>
(but he likes that) maybe rent a cabin. We just decided to throw a  <br/>
big party last year, inviting all the unschoolers we know to the  <br/>
local splashpad. If I had older kids, It might be an indoor pool or  <br/>
something. But right now my heart is drawn to campfires by the lake,  <br/>
smores, music.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1972097658">We simply celebrated by going to see the new Clone Wars movie.  The theater<br/>
was deserted... it was great!  Since both my kids have the tendency to talk<br/>
back to the movies... loudly... I was glad that no one else was there to be<br/>
bugged by it.<br/>
<br/>
I think the main idea is to do something you love.  We focused on going<br/>
places that are generally crowded and unpleasant.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-591008314">I don&#39;t know if I sent it out to this group or not, but I am having a Heck No We Won&#39;t Go <br/>
Back 2 School homeschool/unschool online chat next friday (the 5th).  Maybe you could <br/>
turn it into a party for your family and have a game day, play outside, bake a cake or have <br/>
treats.  Just have a lot of fun. :)<br/>

school &quot;parolees&quot; during the summer that you love to do but hate the<br/>
crowds...do that. Go out to brunch at someplace. Have a picnic. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-116053295">-=-=-Beach day, park day, movie matinee, whatever it is that is crowded with<br/>
school &quot;parolees&quot; during the summer that you love to do but hate the<br/>
crowds...do that. Go out to brunch at someplace. Have a picnic. -=-=-<br/>
<br/>
These are the kinds of things I would suggest too, especially if you live<br/>
somewhere where school kids really do crowd the places you love.<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed over the last few years that there is very little difference in<br/>
the numbers of kids around, probably because they go from one institution<br/>
(school) straight to another (daycare).  We haven&#39;t seen the masses on the<br/>
bicycles wandering the streets during the day... even the skatepark is<br/>
pretty quiet until the evening!<br/>
<br/>
And there&#39;s a big part of me that feels that celebrating *not* going back to<br/>
school feels like a life still dictated by the school&#39;s schedule.<br/>
I really like that the only change (besides the weather) we notice when<br/>
school starts is having to drive slower through the nearby school zone.<br/>
What I really mean is, we celebrate our life EVERY DAY :) We don&#39;t need to<br/>
bring school into our lives as an excuse to do so.<br/>
