 </span></blockquote>As a UU, I can tell you that the Children&#39;s RE (Religious Education) are mostly very laid back and fun.  The younger RE classes (like your children&#39;s classes) are mostly play and crafts with some talk about whatever religion or philosophy they are talking about.  They are NOT classrooms like you would find in schools.  <br/>
<br/>
The RE at the church we used to attend in Alabama was run by an unschooler who has 5 unschooled grandchildren.  She would read stories, have crafts for them to do, engage them in play.  She never forced anyone to do anything that they didn&#39;t want to do.  Most children your children&#39;s ages haven&#39;t been in any kind of formal classes anyway.  <br/>
<br/>
I love the UU church and am glad that I found it.  If you have any questions feel free to ask.  Our church is filled with agnostic, atheist, Hindu, Pagan, &quot;recovering Christian,&quot; Christian, Jewish, Islamic, and &quot;other&quot; believers.  We have white, black, middle and far eastern, Native American, old, young, middle-aged, gay, straight, bi, transgendered, and everything in between working together under one roof and in peace.  It&#39;s a wonderful example for me and my kids, who might not find the same support and acceptance if our odd little family was in a traditional church setting.<br/>

<br/>
I attend a UU church.  I can&#39;t speak for all of them, but most work hard to be respectful of children and of family preferences.<br/>
<br/>
My dh doesn&#39;t go (too many hawaiian shirts for my Bush-loving, big oil dh)and so the kids have the option of going with me or staying home with dh.  Most of my kids choose to go every Sunday because they don&#39;t feel required to go.<br/>
<br/>
My kids always go into the classes that are fairly developmentally based and really relaxed.<br/>
<br/>
A friend doesn&#39;t like to leave her kids in the care of someone else....so she goes into the nursery with them.  She sees it as building relationships for the future, more of religion in action.<br/>

&gt;  Hi Kiersten, I know you didn&#39;t ask for solutions for this, but I would like to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>share with you how my husband and I am able to feel that feeling.  It comes <br/>
from a regular practice of meditation.  There are many differents methods and <br/>
ways to meditate so you could try some and see what works for you.  One of <br/>
the most effective and quick methods in our opinion is  Holosync.  Their <br/>
website is www.centerpointe.com <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sunday school experience will too.  We go to a Unity church and so far my <br/>
kids have enjoyed it.  They&#39;ve had their days when they want to sit with us and <br/>
so we let them.  Usually they grew bored and wanted to go down to the <br/>
sunday school room!  I always meet the teacher and see how she/he feels <br/>
and ask my kids questions afterwards.  I know they&#39;ll let me know if they don&#39;t <br/>
like something!  None of their teachers force the kids to participate if they don&#39;t <br/>
want to but ask them to be respectful of those who do and not be disruptive.  <br/>
You could go with them the first time or two and ask them what they want to <br/>
do.  My kids often don&#39;t want to go at the start of a new class but I ask them to <br/>
try once and then decide.  So far they have decided to continue.  I did tell my <br/>
14 year old that he had to go to the hs (Youth Of Unity) class. (I just had a <br/>
feeling that he&#39;d connect) because we hadn&#39;t been going except once in <br/>
awhile and I wanted to start going more often.    He didn&#39;t want to but I told him <br/>
he had to try it once.  He was mad, at first, then he was the one asking me if <br/>
we were going to church or not.  He actually made me go more regularly!  Any <br/>
way, this is what we did.  Hope  it helps.</div>

Any advice trying to head down this path???<br/>
It often seems to me that it would be so much easier to come from <br/>
one religious belief (any one) and then switch to a different faith <br/>
because the basics are usually about the same. At least there is a <br/>
belief in something!<br/>
It has taken me years to even accept the idea of a higher power.<br/>
I am kind-of at the stage of thinking about God being part of <br/>
everything and everyone.<br/>
<br/>
On my good days, I can feel like a part of something bigger, <br/>
something connecting everyone.<br/>
<br/>
On my bad days, all I can see is that the kids got up early and <br/>
didn&#39;t take naps, LOL.<br/>

Thank you for the support.<br/>
I haven&#39;t attended yet as we have been very busy the past few weeks.<br/>
We have had lots of family stuff going on and Jacob just turned 3 on <br/>
Halloween!<br/>
<br/>
I did go ahead and order the Holosync CDs to start giving myself <br/>
some meditation time. They should be coming in the next few days.<br/>
