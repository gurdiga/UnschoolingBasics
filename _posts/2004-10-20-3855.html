<div id="ygrps-yiv-1568965462">So, how do I teach him to read? Do I give him spelling lists...? I&#39;ve <br/>
looked for that &#39;teach your child to read in 100 lessons&#39; book at the <br/>
library, it&#39;s never in. Anyone know of a good website, with ideas?<br/>
<br/>
Doesn&#39;t yor library have holds?  I am sure they will reserve it for you!  It sounds like if he wants a structured plan then it would be just what he wants....worth waiting a couple weeks for if you can&#39;t afford to invest in his own copy.  <br/>
<br/>
While i&#39;m asking...Jaiden loves math, and everyday asks me to give <br/>
him a page of math problems. I spend 10-15min trying to think up good <br/>
ones, he&#39;s done with them in like 2 min and then tells me he wants <br/>
math problems, not math easys. <br/>
I&#39;ll be honest, I really don&#39;t like math and I have a hard time <br/>
thinking up &quot;problems&quot; for him. We don&#39;t have any extra money right <br/>
now, so I haven&#39;t gone and gotten him a workbook, any one know of a <br/>
good online place to get good math problems?<br/>
 <br/>
Surely the library would have math books.....they are full of math problems if he really wants to subject himself to that!  How old is he?  Why don&#39;t you practice trying to think of real math problems to give him when he asks you?  Get him to take measurements, say, or figure out volume, or count all his blocks and all his legos and add them together for a total block count or I don&#39;t know what kind of math he wants....dad left at 10 am and he will be back at 4 pm how many hours is that that he will be gone?  How many hours have already passed?  Or, if he really wants to sit and do math bookwork (cannot imagine...) teach him to balance your checkbook and budget.  At the store, have him figure out price per ounce so your family can get the best value....<br/>
 <br/>
Is he finished deschooling?  Does he understand that math is all around him or does he think that math means workbooks?  That is great that he is so eager to learn.<br/>
 <br/>
Good luck!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Just wanted to note here that even kids who have been unschooled <br/>
their whole lives can love math workbooks. My kids do all sorts of <br/>
everyday math, from telling time to managing their allowances, but <br/>
both of them *love* math worksheets and ask me to buy those cheesy <br/>
math workbooks at the store. They begged me to print out the times <br/>
tables for them to fill in, that sort of thing. I can understand <br/>
because I love pure math myself, and always enjoyed doing complex <br/>
math homework in college (hated it in high school because it was <br/>
rarely well matched to what I was interested in, but I like it in <br/>
general). It&#39;s definitely possible to understand math is all around <br/>
us in its everyday uses, but also to love math in its pure form, for <br/>
math itself.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One of my three liked to do math workbooks. They all are fine and dandy <br/>
mathwise - Roya has taken several math classes in college, including <br/>
statistics, and gotten As in all of them. She found herself explaining <br/>
concepts to other students (that would be students who had actually <br/>
been in school and therefore had math classes for their whole lives, as <br/>
compared to her - and she&#39;s NOT the one of my three kids who liked math <br/>
workbooks for fun).<br/>
<br/>
My point is that doing the math workbooks for fun is fine, for fun. It <br/>
isn&#39;t really seeming to make any difference in ability, in the long <br/>
run.<br/>

&gt; While i&#39;m asking...Jaiden loves math.....<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just  a few ideas.....my kids love games (probably<br/>
beacuse they love dice so much!)...one that we made up<br/>
that both love to play  we cal &quot;top it&quot;.  You can play<br/>
with as many people as you want, each person taking a<br/>
turn rolling the dice.  For my daughter (now 8) we<br/>
would add the two numbers together and she writes on a<br/>
pad.  (Each person does the same on their turn, unless<br/>
your little one is only into counting the dots on the<br/>
dice).  On the next turn, you do the same and add the<br/>
new number to the first number.....First person to<br/>
reach 100 is the winner (or as we play, when we both<br/>
make it to 100, the game is over)....If you want to<br/>
extend the game, work from 100 backwards to 0 using<br/>
subtraction.  You can also use multiplication with<br/>
this game....it&#39;s a really fun way to get some<br/>
practice with computation.  <br/>
We also have bought some Bicycle card games for 99<br/>
cents a piece...we love these....one is Duo ( a<br/>
strategy/critical thinking game) and Ten Speed (a game<br/>
where you make matches to equal ten....the basis of<br/>
all)....I find that both my kids (8 and 5) can add so<br/>
well in their heads when they think in terms of ten.  <br/>
I hope this helps....<br/>

<br/>
He&#39;s never been to school(he&#39;s six):)<br/>
<br/>
He just loves math, we spend all day playing with numbers, he just also happens to really like number problems, I think a lot of it is him writing it out and seeing the result.<br/>
<br/>
I want to thank everyone for your ideas and suggestions, they have all been really helpful. We went to the library yesterday and Jaiden found some books that he&#39;s really excited about, Captain Underpants and Ricky Ricotta&#39;s Mighty Robot. He knows a bunch of the words and has been reading them to me while I read the rest of the book, and he seems really happy with it. <br/>
<br/>
Thanx again, I&#39;m off, to enjoy in pre-halloween, trick-or-treating at a bunch of the stores and the zoo...let the candy orgy begin... :)<br/>
