<div id="ygrps-yiv-22081028">Leslie Moyer granted permission for me to crosspost this and the next <br/>
post to blast some of teh fallacies about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Matt took the ACT test last month and he just got the scores back <br/>
today. He did *so* great, scoring in the 99th percentile--the highest <br/>
selectivity rating. I&#39;m very proud of him, for sure, but I&#39;m really not <br/>
writing this to brag on *him* but to use his achievement to shine the <br/>
spotlight on the process of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Matt is 17 and has never had a vocabulary assignment, a spelling list, <br/>
or an assigned math worksheet. I have never &quot;assigned&quot; him <br/>
*anything*--no multiplication tables, no books or book reports, no <br/>
worksheets--nothing. He has completely followed his own interests in <br/>
life and had time to have a childhood and healthy adolescence....to be <br/>
creative, to pursue his interests, to develop passions, to dig in the <br/>
dirt, to play music, to play--and fight--with his sisters, to watch TV <br/>
and to read....and read....and read.<br/>
<br/>
As an unschooling mom, I haven&#39;t &quot;done nothing&quot;, however....<br/>
<br/>
I took my children to interesting places, I bought them books and <br/>
electronics kits and magazine subscriptions and computers and Legos and <br/>
magnets and shovels and crayons and guitars and more books. I took them <br/>
to the library *very* often (and from a very early age) and read to <br/>
them often. We went to museums, we got memberships in zoos and art <br/>
museums and went to science clubs and art classes and endless Scouting <br/>
events. We drove endless miles to thousands of events and places and <br/>
volunteer activities and walks-in-the-woods. We heard presentations and <br/>
lectures, we watched TV and movies and stars (both kinds) together, we <br/>
listened to talk radio and had discussions about it in the car, and we <br/>
went to plays and concerts. I indulged their every interest--no matter <br/>
how deep or shallow (IMO)--to the very best of my ability. We hosted <br/>
foreign exchange students and traveled as much as we could afford. We <br/>
shopped for car insurance and tomatoes and thrift-store clothes <br/>
together, we had dinner discussions and no bedtimes (unless it began to <br/>
affect others in the family &lt;g&gt;). We planted gardens and made compost. <br/>
I passed on information about opportunities and believed in my <br/>
children.....and loved them for who they were, uniquely. I tried to put <br/>
aside my goals for their lives and trusted that they would figure out <br/>
their own worthy goals. I tried (but often failed) to be patient. I <br/>
loved their dad, and he loved & supported all of us.<br/>
<br/>
What Matt did has been spectacular to witness. He blossomed, he <br/>
pursued, he reflected, he had patience with me. He *wanted* to do well <br/>
on the ACT so he did what he needed to to achieve that. He accomplishes <br/>
what he puts his mind to--in all different areas of his life. He still <br/>
blows my mind every day....unschooling blows my mind every day. I&#39;ve <br/>
been doing it for all of his 17 years and I *still* don&#39;t understand <br/>
it. But this many years later, I finally trust it most every day.<br/>
<br/>
The Oklahoma Department of Education would have strung me up on truancy <br/>
charges without hesitation if they&#39;d known what was going on in our <br/>
home--it looks *nothing at all* like &quot;school&quot;--if they&#39;d had the chance <br/>
or cared to pursue it. They just couldn&#39;t possibly understand.....they <br/>
know nothing about real learning....only about teaching.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what Matt will do next in his life. It&#39;s often scary for <br/>
me to think about, so I mostly don&#39;t. But I trust him to figure it out <br/>
and I think he trusts we&#39;ll help him however he needs us to.<br/>
<br/>
My daughters are also individuals, of course, and I honestly don&#39;t <br/>
know--nor care--how well they score on the ACT test. I have a feeling <br/>
that at least one of them will shine most strongly in areas not tested <br/>
by those conventional means. And I trust them, too....hard as it is. <br/>
They&#39;re neat people.<br/>
<br/>
I know I tend to be too-evangelical about unschooling. (Evangelical: <br/>
characterized by ardent or crusading enthusiasm; zealous &lt;g&gt;) I don&#39;t <br/>
think it&#39;s the answer for every family, but our family has experienced <br/>
so many gifts through unschooling that we would have missed if I were <br/>
their taskmaster teacher in addition to trying to be their loving <br/>
mother....it&#39;s just too hard for me, personally, to be the latter to <br/>
risk it with the former. And I kept my faith that the former wasn&#39;t <br/>
necessary....even as a goal to &quot;a superior education.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So far, so good.<br/>

  &quot;The hardest problem for the brain is not learning, but forgetting. No <br/>
matter how hard we try, we can&#39;t deliberately forget something we have <br/>
learned, and that is catastrophic if we learn that we can&#39;t learn.&quot;  <br/>
