<div id="ygrps-yiv-111390699">Oh Emilie, you sound truly exhausted. And you sound like an amazing <br/>
mom. I often felt as you described in the first months with my second <br/>
boy but I only had two kids (although both nursing, co-sleeping) and we <br/>
had no traffic to deal with.<br/>
<br/>
Lack of sleep is such a huge issue and it is so impossible to get any <br/>
more night time sleep when they are all so little with night times as <br/>
there are. So that leaves the day time. Does your three year old nap <br/>
still? Is there anyway you could have a quiet time during the <br/>
youngest&#39;s nap where you could at least rest if not actually sleep? I <br/>
know a friend who set up one room to be completely safe for her toddler <br/>
so she could have a nap during the day. This may not work with your <br/>
older kids but perhaps something along these lines could.<br/>
<br/>
I know getting out the door must be almost impossible but I know for me <br/>
my kids are always calmer away from home if there are things to watch <br/>
etc. Would getting out for a walk make for a calmer time (and more <br/>
restful)? Or would it would too much keeping them together?<br/>
<br/>
It would be amazing if you could somehow tie into some support groups <br/>
or community programs so you&#39;d have more of a &quot;pool&quot; of other parents <br/>
to help you out. It sounds like you are almost single parenting at the <br/>
busiest time (physically for mama) in your children&#39;s lives. Are there <br/>
community centers with free programs for parents and kids available <br/>
locally for you? Is there a local La Leche League group? Some LLL <br/>
groups have someone to watch the kids in an adjacent room while the <br/>
moms talk. This is what our group does - the kids come and go checking <br/>
in with mom or staying completely with mom if that is their preference. <br/>
I think you said you were in Canada - I don&#39;t know how it is in other <br/>
provinces but in BC there is a public health unit which knows of all <br/>
local parent programs. Check the blue pages if you have public health <br/>
offices in your province.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you can somehow get some more rest. Your goals and hopes will be <br/>
so much easier when you are not so tired. Time will also make a huge <br/>
difference - I used to continually repeat &quot;this too shall pass&quot; in my <br/>
head over and over. Especially when it was 11 a.m., I was still in my <br/>
pajamas with ds2 in the sling, hadn&#39;t yet had breakfast let alone a cup <br/>
of tea and ds1 was talking a mile a minute and intensely asking for <br/>
help with project number 47 of the morning.<br/>
<br/>
Wishing calm and energy for you.<br/>
Susan<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; How do others with loads of tiny children manage RU? I want to make <br/>
&gt; my life more difficult in order to gain a better relationship with my <br/>
&gt; kids, but I start losing it at some undetermined point of difficulty. <br/>
&gt; How do I give them this? I have given them the gift of each other, <br/>
&gt; which they love and cherish. How do I give them RU too? I know there <br/>
&gt; is a way. I just need a little more direction.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
