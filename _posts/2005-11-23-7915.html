<div id="ygrps-yiv-477390177">***I&#39;m using chocolate as my <br/>
example...***<br/>
<br/>
My lovely Welsh Auntie, Eula, used to tell me there was a difference<br/>
between hot cocoa and hot chocolate.  Hot chocolate she said, was never<br/>
made from cocoa powder.  She always had different chocolates from around<br/>
the world and she made the loveliest hot chocolate, with real chocolate<br/>
and sometimes other ingredients (pepper, cinnamon, ground nuts...) and<br/>
told me (as Ren has discovered) If you know chocolate you&#39;re on your way<br/>
to understanding the secrets of the universe.  : )<br/>
