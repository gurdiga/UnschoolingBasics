Or we&#39;ll get one item<br/>
and tell them to put the other on their  wish list. We do this weekly,<br/>
but this next budget is going to be  much more drastic and I&#39;m<br/>
wondering how to discuss this with them and  handle it at the store,<br/>
when I&#39;m going to be saying that we have to  hold up on things much<br/>
more than we have in the past.<br/>
<br/>
Any  ideas?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Dear Marla,<br/>
Please check out eBay and _www.freecycle.org_ (http://www.freecycle.org)  <br/>
where you can  get so MANY things for reduced prices and free! The most important <br/>
part of  your family is there - the love - everything else will fall right <br/>
into  place. Best of luck to you.<br/>
