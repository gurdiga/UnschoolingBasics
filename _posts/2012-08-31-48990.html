<div id="ygrps-yiv-955415695">Can anyone recommend some unschooling podcasts or videos?  I want my husband to hear more about unschooling not from me and listening to audio is the easiest for him as he does not have the time for books or websites but can listen in the car when he travels.  Thanks for any suggestions.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-780121315">If you&#39;d like to, you can purchase cd&#39;s or mp3s or download many talks from previous conferences.  I love to listen to conference recordings, especially on long car trips.  My children often talk with me or ask questions about what is said as sometimes they listen too.  <br/>

Wide Sky Days (formerly Good Vibrations): Not sure how to order these yet.  I wrote to Flo Gascon to ask.<br/>
<br/>
This one is free and available online.  Maybe it can be downloaded to a cd to take in the car?<br/>
