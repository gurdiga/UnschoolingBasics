<div id="ygrps-yiv-1095174845">Hi folks! If you&#39;re not familiar with Squidoo, it&#39;s a sort of blog thing  <br/>
where you make a page describing an interest -- what they call a lens. I made  <br/>
one about unschooling, and would love for you to look at it. I plan to add more, <br/>
 but it&#39;s a beginning. You can also make your own. If you want to rate it, <br/>
you  have to register, but it&#39;s all free, and I thought it was fun. You can also <br/>
make  money with these things, although other than maybe the Amazon links, I <br/>
didn&#39;t  really look that closely into how.  My link: <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-405022812">Great mind think alike! :-) I started one also! LOL The more the <br/>
merrier I think. I&#39;m still working on mine so I&#39;ll share the link <br/>
later. I think there&#39;s also another one that someone started but I <br/>
don&#39;t have the link handy. When I get mine ready I&#39;ll add both our <br/>
links to my blog. :-) <br/>
