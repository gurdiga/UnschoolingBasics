<div id="ygrps-yiv-594929298">I apologize for the use of absolutes.  Perhaps it would have been more<br/>
accurate to state that the primary reason why the government ended<br/>
slavery had more to do with economics than anything else.  This doesn&#39;t<br/>
negate the wonderful, and often times, selfless work of the<br/>
abolitionists.  <br/>
 <br/>
As for social conscience, I&#39;d argue that while the social conscience of<br/>
the abolitionists was that owning a fellow human was inherently wrong,<br/>
it wasn&#39;t necessarily that of most people in the country at the time.<br/>
The abolitionists would argue that all rational human beings must have<br/>
known deep down that slavery was wrong, and were trying to reach that.<br/>
Perhaps they were right, making the argument that it was the social<br/>
conscience of most that simply needed awakening through their efforts?  <br/>
 <br/>
I certainly wouldn&#39;t consider the abolitionists&#39; work for nothing, but<br/>
keep in mind even history is debatable, and different people interpret<br/>
history differently.  There are people, for example, who argue the<br/>
Holocaust never happened.  I find that ridiculously insane.  On the note<br/>
of the debatability of history, I disclaim that the preceding is my<br/>
interpretation of a piece of history:o).<br/>
