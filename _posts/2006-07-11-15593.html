<div id="ygrps-yiv-1368143369">~He then chose to press a button on his Transformer (toy) that made a<br/>
ringing noise and carefully watched me for a reaction. I asked him to<br/>
go to his room if he wished to make the noise and he glared and<br/>
replied, &quot;No way.&quot; and chose to press the button again.~<br/>
<br/>
I would say &quot;Stop NOW! That is not ok to do when someone is sleeping,<br/>
come out of this room so your brother can sleep and we can talk about<br/>
what is upsetting you&quot;<br/>
or &quot;That needs to stop right NOW, your brother is sleeping, that&#39;s not<br/>
ok.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I have NO problem saying &quot;stop&quot; or &quot;no&quot; when it&#39;s a good idea. RU<br/>
principles don&#39;t include letting somone stomp all over another human<br/>
beings comfort or property. Personal boundaries are important.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s perfectly alright to say &quot;STOP&quot; and get the person into a<br/>
space where they can vent and then be more sympathetic. Sometimes in<br/>
the moment, you don&#39;t have time to sympathize as much as you&#39;d like,<br/>
so the &quot;STOP&quot; needs to come first.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know the child, so I&#39;m sure you can figure out the best ways<br/>
to handle the moment. But it sounds like he doesn&#39;t care if you are<br/>
saying &quot;let&#39;s not do that&quot; as though there is some breakdown between<br/>
the two of you. Does he not care if something bothers the people in<br/>
his family? Or is it a moment of anger thing? I can see why stomping<br/>
around feels good and how easy it would be to not care about the<br/>
sleeping brother at that age, but I&#39;m not sure why he&#39;d keep pushing<br/>
the toy when you asked him to stop. Maybe you can give us more insight.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2127032419">I have tried to explain this to my dh. I see that when children are yelled<br/>
at they tend to shut down, just like adults do. They are scared and their<br/>
mind is racing with fear so they don&#39;t really hear you at all. My dh wonders<br/>
why our children don&#39;t listen to him! I have tried to get him to see how he<br/>
feels and reacts when his boss raises his voice or he gets in an argument<br/>
with a co-worker. When someone is raising their voice to me, they loose me.<br/>
I am angry and only thinking or what I am going to say back, or I am<br/>
intimidated and only feeling fear. It sabotages your whole purpose of<br/>
getting someone&#39;s attention. Now, this is going to sound silly but when I<br/>
want to get my child&#39;s attention I growl at them. I learned this from<br/>
watching female dogs with their puppies. I will turn my voice into a low<br/>
growl and speak very calmly but still growling. It&#39;s kinda hard to explain<br/>
but it gets their attention without causing the tension that yelling does.  <br/>

ordered to do (or not to do) something, even if it is in a relatively  <br/>
mild tone of voice.<br/>
