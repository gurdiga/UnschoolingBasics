what conventionally parented schooled kids are like. (Even they  <br/>
aren&#39;t all the same.)<br/>
<br/>
But there are profound differences between schooled kids and  <br/>
mindfully parented unschooled kids. The difference comes from knowing  <br/>
their parents are their partners who trust and respect them.<br/>
<br/>
Teen rebellion is not an essential part of being a teen. It&#39;s caused  <br/>
by control.<br/>
<br/>
The unfortunate thing is is that parents think that they need to  <br/>
control their kids until the kids stop &quot;acting up&quot;. But the acting up  <br/>
is being caused by control and not being listened to. We don&#39;t get to  <br/>
use mindful parenting because our kids are &quot;good&quot;, our kids are  <br/>
&quot;good&quot; because they&#39;re mindfully parented.<br/>

<br/>
Gut feeling is that nearly all if not all of kids smoking is caused  <br/>
by conventional parenting. Smoking is a form of rebellion. Kids who  <br/>
feel their parents are there to help them get what they want from  <br/>
life, what&#39;s there to rebel against?<br/>
<br/>
When parents draw lines their kids can&#39;t cross, the kids hear &quot;You&#39;re  <br/>
not competent to handle this.&quot; It&#39;s a challenge! When we stop telling  <br/>
them they&#39;re incompetent, when we help them find safe and courteous  <br/>
ways to do what they want, then they challenge themselves in sensible  <br/>
ways, rather than challenging themselves on all the things they&#39;re  <br/>
told they can&#39;t do.<br/>

I think I did. I used to smoke. I started at 15. My mom smoked until her early 40&#39;s when my older brother passed away.<br/>
My father smoked on and off.<br/>
So I smoked.<br/>
But I was able to stop anytime I wanted no problem. I have smoked on and off since then ( much more off then on)<br/>
Now it has been 7 years since I last smoked.I really have no difficulty stopping. I always hated the smoke and the smell.<br/>

I was schooled but I did not smoke out of rebellion. My parents never said I could not smoke. They did tell me it was not good for my health , but heck they were doing themselves.<br/>
They even got the cigarettes for me.<br/>
So not all smoking comes from rebelling but I agree that probably most do.<br/>
My parents were very &quot;on my side&quot; when I was a teen. Really they did back me up in everything. <br/>
We could drink. But none of us kids is really a drinker. <br/>
Of the 4 of us me and my brother smoked. My sister and younger brother never did.<br/>
My parents always talked about how bad cigarettes were in a non judgmental way, but they smoked. Specially my mom.<br/>
She was crazy without a cigarette. Back when I was young smoking was &quot;kind of cool&quot;!<br/>
I too remember smoking my chocolate cigarettes as a young child.<br/>
Myabe because it was no rebellion it was so easy to quit.<br/>
My mom always talked that when she grew up it was very cool to smoke.<br/>
Very elegant. So most people did.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-252248840">One of the reasons that is given for smoking or for drinking or for any other risk taking behavior is that it not only gets you greater access to other people it also may help you to have higher status within a group. <br/>
<br/>
I spent some time looking for an article that would lay it out more clearly than I feel like I&#39;m able to and found this quote: <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In one of Steinberg&#39;s earlier studies, the number of risks teens took in a<br/>
video driving game more than doubled in the presence of their peers, compared<br/>
to when they engaged in the game alone. The presence of peers increased risk<br/>
taking by 50% in college undergraduates who participated in the study, but it<br/>
did not influence the number of risks older adults took.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When peers are not around and in situations which are not emotionally<br/>
charged, teens tend to be much better at controlling impulsive or risky<br/>
behaviors.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s from this <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.webmd.com/parenting/news/20070413/teens-are-hardwired-for-risky-behavior.">http://www.webmd.com/parenting/news/20070413/teens-are-hardwired-for-risky-behavior.</a> <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I found one and David&#39;s job gave me access to it. &quot;Life-history theory and risky drinking&quot; by Elizabeth M. Hill and Kristy Chow. It&#39;s a review paper looking at the demographics of people who are likely to do risk taking behavior. It reminded me of one the reasons that people engage risk taking behavior that I&#39;d forgotten. The idea that choices based on short term outcomes trump decisions made on long term outcomes if you don&#39;t feel like there is going to be a long term.  There is a book by Jim Chisholm that looks at sexual frequency and number of partners when compared with the sense that the person being asked has of how long they will live. Or at least that is some part of the book:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/6oakpd.">http://tinyurl.com/6oakpd.</a> <br/>
<br/>
Cigarette smoking has benefits, not necessarily health benefits, although it does have some health benefits. Just as many risk taking behaviors do have a benefit. The benefit may be access to a certain social group or moving up in the hierarchy of that group. I smoked at 12 and it was like passport for getting me accepted into the social group that I wanted to accept me. If the short term benefits of smoking are great enough than the long term risks should be less important. And if you think you are going to die earlier than you shouldn&#39;t worry so much about the long term risks. So environment is really important to risk taking behavior. I&#39;ll quote this from the article: In a survey of women university students, their expectation of a shorter life-span was associated with more childhood stressors (such as divorce or loss of parents; Chisholm 1999b). That means that the better the home enviroment, the more likely that someone will make choices based on<br/>
 long term benefits over short term benefits. So, even if adults are smoking, if it is a relaxed home, children may not smoke. <br/>
<br/>
(1999b is Chisholm, J. S. (1999b) Attachment and time preference: relations between early stress and sexual behavior in a sample of American university women. Human Nature, 10, 51–83.) I wonder if that was I was thinking of rather than the book?  <br/>
<br/>
Ohh, ohh, just found this paper by Tamas Bereczkei, whose stuff I adore: <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Stressful family environment, mortality, and child socialisation:<br/>
Life-history strategies among adolescents and adults from unfavourable<br/>
social circumstances Tamas Bereczkei <br/>
Janus Pannonius University, Pecs, Hungary <br/>
Andras Csanaky <br/>
Janus Pannonius University, Pecs, Hungary <br/>
This study, based on questionnaires given to 732 subjects, usesan integrative                 approach with a focus on evolutionary(life-history) explanations. In accordance                 withBelsky, Steinberg, and Draper’s theoretical model of socialisation (1991), we claim that experiences during childhoodtrigger variations in the life                 cycle and shiftdevelopmental trajectories as adaptive answers to different environmental conditions. Unfavourable familyconditions constitute an unpredictable                 and unstableenvironment that make children susceptible to adopting opportunistic mating strategies rather than parenting strategies.Based on Chisholm’s                 statement (1993) thathigh stress in the family provides cues for local death rates, we argue that mortality rates may have a significanteffect on reproductive                 decisions, even in post-industrialsocieties. We report that length of schooling,  date<br/>
 of the first marriage, and fertility were associatedwith the                 subjects’ family conditions,such as parental affirmation, emotional                 atmosphere,parent-subject conflicts, and parental relations. Women growingup in                 unfavourable family circumstances finishschooling and marry earlier, and                 this shiftin developmental trajectory is likely to lead to the highernumber of                 children measured among these women.Men, on the other hand, do not show such a                 differencein reproductive output, which may be due to their increasedinvolvement                 in sexual competition. Remarkably,significant correlation has been found between  life-history strategy and mortality rates; those coming fromunfavourable                 environments have more deceasedsisters and brothers than others. It is possible  that individual differences in mating and parenting behaviourare still<br/>
 contingent,                 among others, on localdeath rates.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I think I&#39;ve jumped around a lot. I&#39;ve written this over about 8 hours with many other things happening inbetween. If anyone wants a copy of Elizabeth Hill&#39;s paper I think I can e-mail from David&#39;s e-mail. <br/>

liked the smell of the smoke.  My dad found out about it pretty <br/>
quickly and totally freaked.  My mom just sat me down and asked if I <br/>
thought it was fair for her to ask me not to smoke.  I said no <br/>
because she smoked.  So she asked if I would agree not to smoke <br/>
until I was 18 which I did.  I started smoking again at 19 when I <br/>
was in college and doing the bar thing.  I quit when I was 28 and my <br/>
dd was 3. <br/>
<br/>
 She always complained about the smoking and I never smoked in the <br/>
house.  She has always disliked smoke and will complain if anyone <br/>
smokes around her.  She is 15 now and never had any interest in <br/>
trying cigarettes.  So far she seems to be very careful who she <br/>
hangs out with that they are not into things she&#39;s not ready for.  <br/>
I&#39;m amazed at her sense of judgment.   <br/>

<br/>
FWIW My dad smoked for my entire childhood - he quit when I was about 24<br/>
(which was almost 25 years ago!) My mom quit when I was about 3. Most of<br/>
the extended family smoked for most of my childhood - family gatherings<br/>
usually included clouds of cigarette smoke and lots of coffee. I&#39;ve<br/>
never smoked anything. So &#39;just cause parents do&#39; or &#39;just because<br/>
s/he&#39;s x age&#39; really applies globally. None of my siblings smokes (I<br/>
don&#39;t know if they smoked anything when they were away at college but<br/>
I&#39;ve never seen them smoke nor heard them talk about it). But then<br/>
again, juxtaposed against widespread cigarette smoking all around, we<br/>
also saw one uncle get his lung cut out because of cancer and then die<br/>
anyway and both grandfathers die of smoking related cancers (and one<br/>
grandpa asking for cigarettes while in an oxygen tent in the hospital<br/>
even!) Personally, I just never saw any compelling reason to get<br/>
involved with it - the smoke just smelled bad (it was awful when we<br/>
visited relatives and got stuck in the car with dad for several hours<br/>
with the windows closed up in winter) and it cost $$ even back then. <br/>
<br/>
Fast forward to my now 10 yr old DS. MIL and SILs (and some of their<br/>
friends) smoke. DS thinks it&#39;s nasty smelling and wants nothing to do<br/>
with it, to the point of not wanting to hug MIL when she&#39;s been outside<br/>
smoking and comes back in (thankfully, no one smokes inside ANY house -<br/>
ours or theirs). Every once in a while one of those public service Talk<br/>
to your kids about smoking commercials comes on and we say &quot;do we need<br/>
to talk to you about this?&quot; and he just says Nope, so we don&#39;t belabor<br/>
the point.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-213013624">Both my parents smoked (and I developed bronchitis almost every  <br/>
winter, but we didn&#39;t know it was caused, at least in part, by the  <br/>
secondhand smoke). My brother, the eldest, never smoked that I know  <br/>
of. My older sister did and I had my first cigarette around the age of  <br/>
11. I started smoking in earnest around 14, because my boyfriend smoked.<br/>
<br/>
My smoking wasn&#39;t very noticeable, as everyone&#39;s clothes smelled  <br/>
smoky, as did the house. I was 15 when I told my mother that I was  <br/>
smoking (before I went across the country to visit a friend, because I  <br/>
knew her mother would tell my mother and I preferred that she know it  <br/>
from me). I knew she wouldn&#39;t forbid it and I really didn&#39;t ask for  <br/>
permission.<br/>
<br/>
I quit smoking at 19 when I went with a fellow who eventually became  <br/>
my first husband. He didn&#39;t smoke. I have had a couple of cigarettes  <br/>
since (in really stressful situations), but I haven&#39;t &quot;smoked&quot; for 33  <br/>
years now. My parents also quit in their 50&#39;s, my sister in her 40&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a teen, it was &quot;cool&quot; to smoke. I even liked it. But things  <br/>
change. I had to make the decisions myself. It wouldn&#39;t have helped to  <br/>
be forbidden or ragged on. However, I didn&#39;t have accurate (or even  <br/>
inaccurate) information made available to me at that time, so that I  <br/>
*could* make a more informed decision. I smoked to fit in and to  <br/>
please others, anyway, so maybe it wouldn&#39;t have made a difference. I  <br/>
also quit to do the same. Who knows what I might decide later on in  <br/>
life (even given everything I know about its apparent dangers)? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Robin B.<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I *loved* pretending to smoke with candy (both the sugary kind  <br/>
and bubble gum) cigarettes when I was little.  My friends and I  <br/>
thought we were very glamorous....<br/>

situations and lack of control. It&#39;s not so much being used to rebel as<br/>
it is to feel calmer and more relaxed. I know that my SILs use<br/>
cigarettes this way - whenever something stressful arises, whether it&#39;s<br/>
an argument with a boyfriend or an unexpected expense like a car repair<br/>
or job loss, they go out for a cigarette. Sometimes I just want to say<br/>
Hey, you&#39;d be able to afford that car repair if you hadn&#39;t been smoking<br/>
packs and packs of cigs for the last several years. But I don&#39;t. They<br/>
know that at our house, though, they can smoke outside in the driveway<br/>
BUT they have to police their butts - with two dogs and kids around (not<br/>
so much anymore but we moved here when DS was 3), I don&#39;t want any<br/>
chance of some unsuspecting being getting into the bits of tobacco<br/>
leftovers and ending up sick or worse, not to mention it looks<br/>
disgusting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-164736299"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; My mom always talked that when she grew up it was very cool to smoke.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Very elegant. So most people did.<br/>
When my mom was a young teenager, growing up in Brooklyn, NY (Flatbush<br/>
Avenue) she remembers sitting on the front steps of the house<br/>
(brownstone row house type situation) one summer evening when the bugs<br/>
were coming up (skeeters and gnats and such) and a relative handing each<br/>
of them (her and her siblings) a lit cigarette to keep the bugs away.<br/>
And that started it. What ended it, according to her (I was too young at<br/>
the time to remember) was when I was about 2 or 3 and she was sitting on<br/>
the couch with my baby brother in one arm and a cigarette in the other<br/>
hand and I asked her &#39;do you have to do that?&#39; She set about stopping<br/>
right then. Good thing too because 3 years later, at the ripe old age of<br/>
28, she had a stroke. Had she still been a smoker, the doctors say she<br/>
might not have made it. But her body had started repairing the smoking<br/>
damage to some extent by then and she&#39;s now 71 and loves babysitting her<br/>
5 grandkids. My dad, on the other hand, kept smoking. The thing that<br/>
kicked his butt was when my sister chose to go to college in northern<br/>
FL. It was 1984/85 and planes still had smoking and non-smoking sections<br/>
for relatively short flights (NJ to FL is only about 2 hours or so). My<br/>
dad got seats in non-smoking as the better choice for my mom. He had to<br/>
get up during the flight and go back and find a spot in smoking to light<br/>
up. That just aggravated the daylights out of him - that he had to leave<br/>
his wife by herself and go have a smoke on a TWO hour flight. So, when<br/>
he got back to NJ, he found a hypnotist/behavioral specialist who used<br/>
post hypnotic suggestion to help with the &#39;crazies&#39; and cravings as they<br/>
worked behaviorally to cut the strings tied to smoking one by one -<br/>
&quot;coffee and a cigarette&quot; snip; &quot;phone call and a cigarette&quot; snip,<br/>
&quot;driving and a cigarette&quot; snip, etc. until he could choose to smoke all<br/>
he wanted but not while he was actually doing anything else. Then it was<br/>
easy to stop. It was kind of fun in a way because us kids were in on<br/>
what he was doing but he was saving it as a surprise for my mom&#39;s<br/>
birthday which happened to coincide with the end of the process. So,<br/>
once a week for a couple months that summer, we &#39;covered&#39; for him when<br/>
he got home from work a little later than usual &quot;oh must&#39;ve been<br/>
traffic&quot; or &quot;he mentioned he had to do something for JTIDS (or some<br/>
other project - we knew all the acronyms for the stuff he worked on).<br/>
He&#39;s now 77 going on 78.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-775107554">Some of that really resonates with regard to DH&#39;s sisters. It&#39;s almost<br/>
like there are two families because DH and one SIL are close in age but<br/>
then there&#39;s about a 15 year gap before the younger two SILs. And, in<br/>
the time between, the family situation went from fairly stable to shaky<br/>
financially and martially. The two olders were adults when MIL and FIL<br/>
separated for a time, whereas the younger two were still under 10 at the<br/>
time. Though they reconciled and put the household back together<br/>
somewhat, there was still a lot of tension and all in the household. And<br/>
the two younger SILs are the ones who continue to smoke (the other SIL<br/>
smoked for a time and stopped, DH never smoked cigarettes but smoked<br/>
other &#39;plant matter&#39; for a short time right after high school) -<br/>
*despite* allergies and serious asthma. Makes me nearly hit the roof<br/>
when SIL#3 comes back in from having a cigarette and reaches for her<br/>
inhaler! <br/>

 <br/>
Looking back that probably why I smoked most of the time.<br/>
When things where stressful. But see I was the good girls that learned to hide her feelings so I kept all bottled up inside.<br/>
I still can&#39;t handle some feelings well, like anger and frustration.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-506441837">My father smoked forever, and, in fact, just died a few months ago from  <br/>
smoking related cancer.<br/>
 <br/>
When I was about 12 my parents gathered me and my younger sister and gave  us <br/>
permission to smoke. I think we each probably tried one or two cigarettes,  <br/>
but neither of us has ever smoked. They figured it made sense to be open so we  <br/>
could talk about it rather than have us sneak around. Obviously that worked. <br/>
 <br/>
We never did that with Julian because it was largely unnecessary. I suspect  <br/>
that our giving formal &quot;permission&quot; for anything would&#39;ve just been  <br/>
confusing.  And as a singer, he never considered doing anything that could  screw up <br/>
his voice.<br/>

mean lack of control as in unable to control one&#39;s own self but rather<br/>
feeling as if one has no control over one&#39;s own life, being told what to<br/>
do, when to do it, how to do it, and so on (the typical lot of most<br/>
minors).<br/>

  Most people think they know what kids are like but they really know <br/>
  what conventionally parented schooled kids are like. (Even they <br/>
  aren&#39;t all the same.)<br/>
<br/>
  But there are profound differences between schooled kids and <br/>
  mindfully parented unschooled kids. The difference comes from knowing <br/>
  their parents are their partners who trust and respect them.<br/>
<br/>
  Teen rebellion is not an essential part of being a teen. It&#39;s caused <br/>
  by control.<br/>
<br/>
  The unfortunate thing is is that parents think that they need to <br/>
  control their kids until the kids stop &quot;acting up&quot;. But the acting up <br/>
  is being caused by control and not being listened to. We don&#39;t get to <br/>
  use mindful parenting because our kids are &quot;good&quot;, our kids are <br/>
  &quot;good&quot; because they&#39;re mindfully parented.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; ?/ will a kid smoke<br/>
  &gt; just cos his parents do ?/ and do we just say &#39;&#39; oh hes 15, hell <br/>
  &gt; do it<br/>
  &gt; anyway ?<br/>
<br/>
  My mom smoked. Neither I nor my sister did.<br/>
<br/>
  Gut feeling is that nearly all if not all of kids smoking is caused <br/>
  by conventional parenting. Smoking is a form of rebellion. Kids who <br/>
  feel their parents are there to help them get what they want from <br/>
  life, what&#39;s there to rebel against?<br/>
<br/>
  When parents draw lines their kids can&#39;t cross, the kids hear &quot;You&#39;re <br/>
  not competent to handle this.&quot; It&#39;s a challenge! When we stop telling <br/>
  them they&#39;re incompetent, when we help them find safe and courteous <br/>
  ways to do what they want, then they challenge themselves in sensible <br/>
  ways, rather than challenging themselves on all the things they&#39;re <br/>
  told they can&#39;t do.<br/>

<br/>
My always unschooled kids don&#39;t seem to have a need for rebellion for<br/>
rebellions sake, but they do seem to have a need for experimentation.<br/>
So is smoking rebelling or just experimenting?  Is experimenting<br/>
rebelling?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
It depends. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Cameron&#39;s big on experimentation. And since we&#39;ve always encouraged <br/>
that, it&#39;s counter-intuitive for me to put on brakes when he continues <br/>
to experiment.<br/>
<br/>
He wasn&#39;t always unschooled. Cam went to school through sixth grade. So <br/>
his experience may be colored by school. I&#39;ll have more <br/>
&quot;alwaysunschooled&quot; info about Duncan in a few years. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But we have gotten a lot of feedback from Cam&#39;s friends who *are* <br/>
rebelling. There seems to be a big difference in the *depth* they go <br/>
and in the risks they choose to take. Cameron looks at their forays as <br/>
a &quot;scientist&quot; as well. Or maybe as a sociologist. &lt;g&gt; He does examine <br/>
their choices---as well as his own---and what drives them (and him).<br/>
<br/>
*I* think that, if a person has nothing to rebel against, he still may <br/>
want to *know* what the buzz is. It&#39;s a different paradigm.<br/>
