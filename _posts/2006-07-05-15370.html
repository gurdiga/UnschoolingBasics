<div id="ygrps-yiv-1357038342">~Ren said this to me once and I remind myself of it often. Eating IS<br/>
ruining your appetite.~<br/>
<br/>
This came up at the conference last year, in reference to kids eating<br/>
while you&#39;re cooking a meal. I said &quot;The whole POINT of eating is to<br/>
&#39;ruin your appetite! If you don&#39;t want your kids to ruin their<br/>
appetite, then don&#39;t ever, ever FEED them!!&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I got the strangest looks, but then a couple of lights went on.:)<br/>
Another time (before we were unschooling totally) I had a friend at my<br/>
house that kept fussing at her son for munching on the carrots while<br/>
we were fixing a meal. I looked at her and said &quot;Becky, the carrots<br/>
are probably far healthier than anything we&#39;re going to sit down and<br/>
eat, why are you nattering about it??&quot;<br/>
Another moment of a funny look and then &#39;DING&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Food is a funny thing, only because of the really lame way most of us<br/>
were raised in regards to food. I think the human creature is well<br/>
equipped to eat what makes it feel better...even if it doesn&#39;t seem<br/>
that way at times.<br/>
<br/>
As far as &quot;wasted&quot; food, if you&#39;re eating something when your body is<br/>
saying you don&#39;t want it, I think that&#39;s far more wasteful than<br/>
throwing it in the trash!!  If it makes the parents feel better, then<br/>
start a compost pile, at least the worms will eat your &quot;waste&quot; food.:)<br/>
<br/>
I was pondering this one night, as I scraped some plates off after<br/>
dinner. I thought &quot;I wonder why the waste of this small amount of food<br/>
still bothers me???&quot;<br/>
I&#39;ve never been a member of the &quot;clean-your-plate&quot; club, so it baffles<br/>
me that throwing food away still turns on these internal triggers. I<br/>
wondered if it was childhood stuff, or just the fact that money is<br/>
really tight right now.<br/>
<br/>
Probably the latter. Then I thought about what a parent would spend<br/>
for a health curriculum!! I realized that all the food we throw away<br/>
in a year probably doesn&#39;t equal ONE curriculum package!! And my kids<br/>
are learning about food from the real thing, not a stupid text book.<br/>
Now I&#39;m thinking about all the ways we spend our money differently,<br/>
because of being unschoolers. Cool.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My theory on this has always been that once it is cooked it is<br/>
&quot;wasted.&quot;  We can&#39;t offer cooked food to starving children in India or<br/>
donate it to a food bank.  Once cooked it is either headed towards the<br/>
garbage or (eventually) the sewer.  :-)  What bothers me more than<br/>
someone not eating (all) of what I have cooked is when I overbuy food<br/>
and have to throw it out. To me that is waste.  I would prefer to<br/>
throw out a serving of beans that someone didn&#39;t eat than to throw out<br/>
beans that have turned into some sort of ill-fated science experiment.<br/>
<br/>
India was the country where my mother always told me the starving<br/>
children were.  When we didn&#39;t &quot;clean our plates&quot; my mom would remind<br/>
us of the &quot;starving children in India&quot; who would LOVE the green beans<br/>
with okra or meatloaf that I was turning my nose up at (apologies to<br/>
those of you that like okra and meatloaf).  I can remember even being<br/>
as young as 3 or 4 how one could possibly get already cooked food to<br/>
another country.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah - have you checked out the cost of health clubs, &quot;diet&quot; food, <br/>
and all that? Not to mention the doctor bills and other stuff <br/>
related to weight-related problems (overweight, hypertension, etc)? <br/>
Throwing out a few servings of rice or whatever is way less <br/>
expensive than the physical and emotional damage.<br/>
<br/>
Also, this falls into being a student of your kids - if we&#39;re paying <br/>
attention (&quot;we&quot; as in me and DH &quot;we&quot;), we can generally chart DS&#39; 36 <br/>
hr food cycle and plan accordingly &quot;He had a big morning today&quot; so <br/>
we go light on dinner for him or &quot;He had a big lunch yesterday, <br/>
better plan on an extra hot dog tonight&quot; Leftovers can be lunch <br/>
tomorrow for me in most cases or recycled into another meal later in <br/>
the week - Saturday afternoons are often &quot;scavenger time&quot; when we <br/>
just pull out whatever is leftover from the week and put together <br/>
all sorts of odd combinations and maybe add a new bit to tie it <br/>
together (or not). If it goes beyond Saturday, then it&#39;s likely <br/>
going to be tossed - by then it&#39;s had a fair chance to make its case.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL we used to joke about this because my mom heard it all the time <br/>
but she never said it to us. Of course, my mom got &quot;be grateful for <br/>
this...&quot; too - with some reason, since often dinner in her childhood <br/>
was slices of bread with watered down catsup &quot;red devil&quot; sandwiches <br/>
she calls them. We were quite willing to send her ill-fated peanut <br/>
butter stuffed chicken breasts (bleh!) to anyone who wanted them - <br/>
she took one bite and told my dad to order a pizza!lol<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Someone else mentioned about feeling twinges not from food partially <br/>
eaten but from overbuying and then tossing &quot;science experiments&quot; of <br/>
stuff that just sat and never got touched (like those bananas that <br/>
turned black and slimy). One thing I&#39;ve taken to doing to help with <br/>
the twinges is (a) refine the buying a bit - don&#39;t just presume that <br/>
since we ate 6 avocados last week that we&#39;ll need 6 avocados this week <br/>
too - I&#39;ll ask and we&#39;ll discuss. (b) I&#39;ll use a bit of the money <br/>
saved from not overbuying (whenever possible) to pick up one of <br/>
those &quot;Food for All&quot; cards they have at the grocery checkout (are they <br/>
local or national things?) or something such as that which helps get <br/>
nutritious food to those who need it (Food for All and Foodshare both <br/>
address local hunger I believe and there are plenty of organizations <br/>
that address world hunger issues). Another idea that I&#39;ve seen is that <br/>
people will round off the amount (if it comes to $123.62 they round to <br/>
$125 for instance) and tuck away that difference each week. Then they <br/>
use that mount to send to wherever. Could do the same with coupon <br/>
savings - whatever amount you saved from the grocery budget by using <br/>
coupons, buying store brands instead of namebrands, buying the <br/>
specials, and so on goes to hunger relief projects - you haven&#39;t <br/>
changed your own budget but you&#39;ve had an incentive to buy more <br/>
mindfully. For example, if you skip buying the packaged cookies and <br/>
make your own at home, the difference in cost would go to relief.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to go outside your home, you can check with local <br/>
facilities such as bakeries and groceries and local shelters and food <br/>
kitchens and try to arrange for day-old products to go from the bakery <br/>
to the food kitchen instead of the dumpster. There are regulations <br/>
about things related to food safety but often there are ways to manage <br/>
it. For example, we have a big Thanksgiving luncheon here at work on <br/>
the Wednesday before Thanksgiving - pasta dishes, cold cuts platters, <br/>
desserts, side dishes, etc. One of my coworkers helps wrap things up <br/>
afterward and takes the usable stuff over to a local shelter - they <br/>
get lots of stuff for Thanksgiving but not a lot before or after.<br/>
