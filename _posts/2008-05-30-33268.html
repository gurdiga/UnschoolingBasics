<div id="ygrps-yiv-542998961">Hey everyone, I posted a while back on here about the flowering of a<br/>
Children&#39;s culture at the Teaching Drum Outdoor School (before you say<br/>
&quot;School!?&quot; you may want to reconsider why we call ourselves a school,<br/>
we&#39;re about as unschooling as it gets! i.e. major &quot;coyote teachers&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m back - no longer the school nanny - but with major enthusiasm for<br/>
a children&#39;s culture.  My role at the school has changed - our<br/>
yearlong program has a few dozen graduates now (some of the most<br/>
highly aware and self-knowing people I&#39;ve ever met), and part of our<br/>
vision for growing into ourselves and for feeding the native lifeway<br/>
is to have a place where these graduates can return to and carry on<br/>
their learning.  That place is called Mashkodens - little prairie camp<br/>
- a 10 minute walk through the woods behind the school center.  I have<br/>
lived there since last green season where myself and others have built<br/>
the foundations of a live, full-time native camp.  While Mashkodens&#39;<br/>
door is always open to yearlong graduates, we also offer one-moon<br/>
immersions to people interested in learning by example and experience<br/>
what it is to live natively (to have one&#39;s means and ends intimately<br/>
connected, to live in the moment without distraction, to be as a<br/>
circle, to gather, to cook primitively, to travel with the turn in the<br/>
seasons and embrace the gifts of the Mother whether they be snowshoe<br/>
hare, suckerfish or blueberries).<br/>
<br/>
For the first time we are going to have a child participate in a Wild<br/>
Moon: 4 year old Luuk with his mother and her partner (who is a<br/>
yearlong graduate).  Energy is shifting all over the school to<br/>
capitalize on this major opportunity; the parents living at the school<br/>
are facing fears of their own and re-arranging plans and possible<br/>
living arrangements to be more present at Mashkodens, offering their<br/>
own children a chance to build community with Luuk at the camp.  I&#39;m<br/>
advertising the time in which they come (Raspberry Moon: August 1-29)<br/>
as a &quot;Children&#39;s Moon,&quot; and inviting any parents interested in<br/>
participating to join us for a Wild Moon!  <br/>

<br/>
Let this be an unfolding of learning in relationship with children<br/>
that I can see we all hunger for!<br/>
