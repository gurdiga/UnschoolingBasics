TV is not a demon. It&#39;s just another medium. It&#39;s another window to  <br/>
the world, more akin, in fact, to the internet and the library than  <br/>

<br/>
I agree t.v. is not a demon, however in writing an article for local<br/>
magazines about the increasing number of TVs in local restaurants and<br/>
requesting that local owners do away with them or turn them off unless<br/>
otherwise requested I&#39;ve uncovered a lot of research from around the world<br/>
regarding television watching.  What sticks out most is that when you watch<br/>
television the brain waves in your brain switch the wave that is the<br/>
meditation/sleep wave.  For this reason, especially at my daughter&#39;s age I<br/>
feel it appropriate for me to monitor the amount of TV viewing she does.<br/>
Let me remind you I do not claim to be a RU, so I&#39;m sure there are those of<br/>
you who will disagree with my &quot;interference&quot;.  But, just like the mother who<br/>
censors what her son watches so he doesn&#39;t get nightmares I&#39;m doing what I<br/>
feel is best for my daughter.  <br/>
<br/>
This is the same way I feel about the question of me not allowing my<br/>
daughter to partake of some foods.  I &quot;censor&quot; what my daughter eats.<br/>
Diabetes is very prevalent in my family and my daughter and I both have<br/>
about a 75% chance of getting it, me in the next 10 yrs, her by the age of<br/>
20-30.  I have a aunt who is blind and dying from the disease.  So I&#39;m<br/>
taking measures now to help develop healthy eating habits in all of our<br/>
family.  My DH has a cholesterol, and yes there was a time when he asked for<br/>
steak and I told him no, not until is cholesterol is lowered.  For me it&#39;s<br/>
less about freedom and more about health/nutrition.<br/>
<br/>
My answer to the question about coffee.  Yes, I&#39;ve heard there are benefits<br/>
to drinking it, as with red wine, but I wouldn&#39;t start giving my child a<br/>
glass of wine every night for dinner or coffee every morning. Nutritionally<br/>
(these post have made me realize I should be using the word nutritious<br/>
rather than healthy)I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much if any value in either,<br/>
especially when you add the amount of sugar in a vanilla latte.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s because the majority of people who watch television are not truly<br/>
engaged in this activity.  Did you know that people who knit also switch to<br/>
a meditative/sleep wave pattern?  People who do repetitive activities also<br/>
will do this.  Also, how truly engaged were these people in watching tv or<br/>
were they watching it because it was there?  What about the difference<br/>
between a person who was watching a rerun of Law and Order and someone who<br/>
was watching something that truly interested them such as a sporting event,<br/>
action movie, documentary, news or a new episode of a favorite program?<br/>
<br/>
If someone is truly unschooled and have unlimited access to television then<br/>
television will become just another tool to engage with.  When limited it<br/>
becomes something coveted.  I&#39;ve watched my daughter&#39;s friend who is<br/>
traditionally schooled with lots of limitations put on her come to our house<br/>
and want to spend the entire weekend watching tv or playing video games.  My<br/>
daughter is saying, &quot;Come on let&#39;s go do something&quot; or &quot;Would you like to<br/>
walk down to the park?&quot; and her friend totally zoned out in front of the<br/>
tv.  She thinks my kids are so lucky that they can watch tv anytime that<br/>
they want!  To her tv is a limited commodity and when she does get to watch<br/>
it she watches all she can.<br/>
<br/>
Oh and I knit while I watch tv, so I must be nearly catatonic :)<br/>

<br/>
Why does that frighten you?<br/>
<br/>
What evidence in unschooled children have you seen that supports what  <br/>
you fear?<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something I wrote a while ago when someone brought up the  <br/>
meditation/sleep wave &quot;research&quot;:<br/>
<br/>
++++++++<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And, actually a study was done that shows that some children, a  <br/>
&gt; limited number, do not think while &quot;zoning&quot; in front of the boob  <br/>
&gt; tube. Some children actually go into an almost sleep/dream state, a  <br/>
&gt; sort of self-hypnosis in which they brain waves patterns indicate  <br/>
&gt; no active thought patterns.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Can you site a source for this? I can&#39;t seem to find one. What I did  <br/>
find (over and over and over) is a quote from &quot;Battle for Your Mind:  <br/>
Subliminal Programming&quot;: by Dick Sutphen:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Recent tests by researcher Herbert Krugman showed that, while  <br/>
&gt;&gt; viewers were watching TV, right-brain activity outnumbered left- <br/>
&gt;&gt; brain activity by a ratio of two to one. Put more simply, the  <br/>
&gt;&gt; viewers were in an altered state . . . in trance more often than  <br/>
&gt;&gt; not. They were getting their Beta-endorphin &quot;fix.&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; To measure attention spans, psychophysiologist Thomas Mulholland  <br/>
&gt;&gt; of the Veterans Hospital in Bedford, Massachusetts, attached young  <br/>
&gt;&gt; viewers to an EEG machine that was wired to shut the TV set off  <br/>
&gt;&gt; whenever the children&#39;s brains produced a majority of alpha waves.  <br/>
&gt;&gt; Although the children were told to concentrate, only a few could  <br/>
&gt;&gt; keep the set on for more than 30 seconds!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Left brain activity (according to an anatomy and physiology text) is  <br/>
associated with spoken and written language, numerical and scientific  <br/>
skills and reasoning. Right brain activity is associated with musical  <br/>
and artistic awareness, space and pattern perception, insight,  <br/>
imagination, generating mental images to compare spatial  <br/>
relationships. (No connection is made between right brained  <br/>
activities and being in a trance like state.)<br/>
<br/>
 From that list, it makes sense to me that TV watching would be a  <br/>
right brained activity. I suppose if there&#39;s something inherently  <br/>
wrong with right brained activities, we should stop kids from drawing  <br/>
and imagining and being insightful.<br/>
<br/>
The text says that alpha waves are present in the EEGs of nearly all  <br/>
normal individuals when they are awake and resting with their eyes  <br/>
closed. These waves disappear entirely during sleep. Beta waves  <br/>
generally appear when the nervous system is active, that is, during  <br/>
periods of sensory input and mental activity. (Note that it says  <br/>
generally.)<br/>
<br/>
(Just as an interesting factoid, it says delta waves occur during  <br/>
deep sleep but they are also normal in an awake infant.)<br/>
<br/>
Another site says alpha waves are brought out by closing the eyes and  <br/>
by relaxation, and abolished by eye opening or alerting by any  <br/>
mechanism (thinking, calculating). Alpha waves are the major rhythm  <br/>
seen in normal relaxed adults - it is present during most of life  <br/>
especially beyond the thirteenth year when it dominates the resting  <br/>
tracing. (Alpha waves are also present during meditation and  <br/>
hypnosis.) And that beta waves are the dominant rhythm in patients  <br/>
who are alert or anxious or who have their eyes open.<br/>
<br/>
That would suggest people aren&#39;t thinking when they watch TV. But  <br/>
does that make sense? I could list off a huge number of things that  <br/>
I&#39;ve learned from watching TV. How can learning take place without  <br/>
thinking? There is also research into Controlling Computers With  <br/>
Neural Signals (in Scientific American) which uses Alpha and Mu  <br/>
waves. If alpha waves stop when thought happens, how could those  <br/>
waves be used to perform a computer action if we have to stop  <br/>
thinking in order to generate them?<br/>
<br/>
What it really means is that people enjoy dabbling in pseudo-science.  <br/>
They are using faulty logic -- hypnosis may generate alpha but that  <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean alpha indicates hypnosis, thinking may generate beta but  <br/>
that doesn&#39;t mean that beta indicates thinking (or that lack of beta  <br/>
means lack of thinking) -- to draw a conclusion to fit their theory.<br/>
<br/>
To get a more complete picture we need to know what the waves look  <br/>
like when we&#39;re deeply involved in a novel. Or watching a play. Or  <br/>
playing a video game. Or watching a sporting event. Or painting. Or  <br/>
gazing down at a sleeping or nursing infant. (Not that it would  <br/>
indicate anything. It would just be more data on how the brain  <br/>
operates.) If alpha waves increased during those times, should we  <br/>
stop those things? Or does it merely mean that &quot;thinking stops alpha  <br/>
waves&quot; and &quot;beta is present during mental activity&quot; are too  <br/>
simplistic and don&#39;t adequately describe what&#39;s going on?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I &quot;censor&quot; what my daughter eats.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A coworker had an adult son with juvenile diabetes. She too felt his  <br/>
eating habits and behavior were her responsibility until he showed he  <br/>
could be trusted. And because he fought against the control he never  <br/>
showed he could be trusted. He was an adult when she told me of his  <br/>
self destructive behavior but she still felt she needed to save him  <br/>
from himself. (Which I think *is* a perfectly natural need!)<br/>
<br/>
This was long before I read about  trusting kids but even I could see  <br/>
that he was self-destructing not because he was stupid but because  <br/>
his mother had never trusted him to be intelligent enough not to want  <br/>
to die.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Diabetes is very prevalent in my family and my daughter and I both  <br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; about a 75% chance of getting it<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Family history of diabetes and alcoholism, food allergies are all  <br/>
realities of some kids&#39; lives. If we trust them, children can  <br/>
understand the consequences of the choices they have.<br/>
<br/>
Trust doesn&#39;t mean letting them learn entirely through  <br/>
experimentation. We can give them information. When death is not  <br/>
imminent, we can help them experiment and learn what their own bodies  <br/>
are capable of.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Yes, I&#39;ve heard there are benefits<br/>
&gt; to drinking it, as with red wine, but I wouldn&#39;t start giving my  <br/>
&gt; child a<br/>
&gt; glass of wine every night for dinner or coffee every morning.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No one said give your child coffee because it&#39;s healthy. Someone was  <br/>
questioning the statement that coffee is bad for you.<br/>
<br/>
The principle is to be our children&#39;s partner as they explore the  <br/>
world. A sip of coffee or a sip of alcohol won&#39;t hurt a kid. Even, as  <br/>
many people pointed out, nothing bad has come from kids who had  <br/>
coffee somewhat regularly.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; especially when you add the amount of sugar in a vanilla latte.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What do you fear will happen if your child drinks the amount of sugar  <br/>
in a vanilla latte?<br/>
<br/>
Have you asked how radical unschoolers handle children with special  <br/>
dietary needs?<br/>

when a child asks for it to offering it your child. No<br/>
one has suggested that you offer non-nutritious stuff<br/>
to your kid. The issue is what do you do when your kid<br/>
asks for it. <br/>

&gt; &gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt; about a 75% chance of getting it<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I meant to comment on this earlier and forgot.  My co-parent is diabetic.<br/>
Because of Keon&#39;s eating issues (for those that may not have read recent<br/>
past posts on this Keon falls into the autistic spectrum and has difficulty<br/>
with many issues including food) Dan was concerned that he, too, would end<br/>
up diabetic.  My maternal grandfather was also diabetic.  We too had heard<br/>
75% thrown at us.  Dan talked to his doctor and what she said is that<br/>
someone having a 75% chance of getting something is grossly misworded.  The<br/>
way that it should be worded is that a person who has a family history of<br/>
diabetes has a 75% higher chance of developing diabetes than someone with NO<br/>
family history of diabetes and that it is very rare to find someone who has<br/>
NO history of diabetes.  She said also to consider what type of diabetes it<br/>
is and when it developed in a person.  Was the diabetes juvenile or<br/>
something that was an issue in a healthy fit adult or did the diabetes<br/>
develop when the adult was in his late 30&#39;s or later and was a result of<br/>
improper eating.  The reason that we see family histories of late-onset<br/>
diabetes has more to do with diet than genetics.  Fat adults mostly have fat<br/>
children not because of genetics but because of the type of diet that they<br/>
subject their children to.  The children develop diabetes not because of<br/>
genetics but because of lifestyle<br/>
<br/>
So how does unschooling play in all this?  Simple, children when allowed to<br/>
set their own eating patterns may indulge at first, but eventually will<br/>
balance out because they learn what feels good when they eat and what feels<br/>
not so good.  Sure watermelon tastes good but if you eat half a watermelon<br/>
(or even a 2&quot; ring of watermelon) you will get a tummy ache and that doesn&#39;t<br/>
feel good.  So the next time they may have only a quarter of a watermelon<br/>
(or 1/2 of a 2&quot; ring.)  Maybe chocolate cake tastes great, but if you eat<br/>
half a chocolate cake while your mouth may be happy your body isn&#39;t.  They<br/>
learn to distinguish those things without an adult telling them what to<br/>
eat.  It may surprise you to know that even though our house has quite a bit<br/>
of &quot;junk food&quot; in it, my kids are just as apt to grab a piece of fruit or<br/>
cheese or a slice of bread as they are chips, cookies or candy.<br/>
