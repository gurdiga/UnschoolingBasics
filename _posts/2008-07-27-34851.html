<div id="ygrps-yiv-420538865">I have responded to a few questions and have even asked one but I have not<br/>
actually introduced myself and family. My name is Tammy and am married to<br/>
Scott. We have two boys, Jake(10) and Adam(6). We have been unschooling<br/>
since I heard the term and knew that&#39;s what we were doing for the most part<br/>
anyway. I am still learning and growing and striving for a more balanced<br/>
perspective as my kids are growing older. I have been meaning to get on this<br/>
list for at least 10 months, since the last Live and Learn conference and am<br/>
glad I finally did.<br/>
