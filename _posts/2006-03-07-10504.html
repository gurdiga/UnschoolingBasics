<div id="ygrps-yiv-923300026">Seth (11), was watching Episodes 1-3 of Star Wars yesterday and my dh asked<br/>
how watching 6 hrs of Star Wars is educational.  I didn&#39;t have an answer so<br/>
I thought I might pose the question to the group.  I figure you all with<br/>
more experience in seeing the learning in everything would be able to help<br/>
put things in a school subject category.  Of course, him watching the series<br/>
didn&#39;t bother me and he even stopped the last movie part way through to go<br/>
outside and play with his friends that are in school.  I quote, &quot;I didn&#39;t<br/>
want to miss a chance to play with my friends.&quot;  He is watching the rest of<br/>
the last movie today since he missed it yesterday by going out to play.<br/>
 <br/>
How is watching 6 hrs of Star Wars educational?<br/>

really speaks volumes about what a kid might be getting out of <br/>
watching a move or the TV for any length of time.  Perhaps you can <br/>
extrapolate some good answers to your question after reading this:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1045179872">Tristan (9) is a huge Star Wars and Lord of the Rings fan; right now he is on a big &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; kick for some reason, watching it daily.  Movies (and TV in general) have been great jumping off points for him when it comes to new interests. <br/>
<br/>
Now...these might not all be things that are happening RIGHT when Tristan is watching a movie, but the movies often inspire so many things after.<br/>
<br/>
Tristan often tries to really analyze the characters....Why did Anakin turn so quickly to the Dark Side?  What other options did he have?  Why did so-and-so choose to do what they did? These conversations usually occur DURING the movie, when I&#39;m enjoying the movie with him.  This can easily carry over to any movie/TV show. (ethics, decision making, etc.).<br/>
<br/>
He often uses the Star Wars Galaxy and Middle Earth as backdrops for games, written/oral stories, and drawings he creates.  Often when he makes games they are stylized after D&D or other role playing game, where players have hit points that they gain/lose.  Tristan doesn&#39;t like writing math down so he tallies all the numbers in his head (and somehow is able to remember not only his own but all the other players hit points at the same time).  He seeks out the many books written about Star Wars, and other movies he enjoys.  In addition to fueling his love of reading, he now knows more about Star Wars than both of his geeky, Star Wars loving parents. ;o)  (reading, art, writing, math) <br/>
<br/>
Tristan also is really getting into the making of movies...he&#39;ll watch the behind the scenes features over and over and often chooses to watch the movies with the director/actor commentaries.  He has watched &quot;The Two Towers&quot; with all three commentaries (actors, director, art/set design).  He learns about the areas where the movies were filmed, different special effects, how the shots were created, the obstacles that had to be overcome in making the films, etc.  This has lead him to create his own movies and then insists on making his own &quot;behind the scenes&quot; feature where he sits in front of the camera to tell the audience his reasoning for making the movie.<br/>
<br/>
The Star Wars movies, particularly Episodes I-III are basically one special effect after another.  Tristan has learned SO much about CG effects and will often compare one movie&#39;s effects to another and searches out movies done by the same special effects guys (like Stan Winston, etc.).  This has lead him to looking into how to make latex masks and other &quot;simple&quot; special effects. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if all my ramblings are helpful, Christy, but maybe they&#39;ll give you a few ideas. :o)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1901593995">A really easy one is an introduction to roman numerals since the <br/>
episodes are numbered I-VI not 1-6, granted that episodes I-III are <br/>
pretty simple (but I&#39;m betting IV-VI aren&#39;t far behind in the <br/>
marathon plans). Also, time - how long is it, can I watch the whole <br/>
thing and still play with my friends or do I have to stop it? I know <br/>
my DS (almost 8) has gotten good at finding the runtime of videos <br/>
and checking the clock to see if he has enough time before x to <br/>
watch the whole thing. Then there&#39;s literature: the good vs evil <br/>
genre; the &#39;tragic flaw&#39; - Anakin&#39;s fear and anger and regret <br/>
regarding his mother plays into his fears for Padme which eventually <br/>
drive him to the Dark Side - it&#39;s classic (you can probably even <br/>
find similar themes in Shakespeare!); plot devices; all that kind of <br/>
stuff is the makings of literature. History - even though it isn&#39;t <br/>
specifically *our* history, it&#39;s not a far stretch from watching how <br/>
Palpatine used fear of the Separatists to consolidate power and <br/>
bring the Empire to war and how Hitler used fear in the aftermath of <br/>
WWI to come to power and plunge Europe and the world into war <br/>
(obviously very over simplified); there&#39;s also the concepts of <br/>
democracy, republic, empire forms of government involved. Science: <br/>
cloning is a big obvious one - is it possible to do what they did to <br/>
make the clone army?; Mustafar - the volcanic planet - is it <br/>
possible or would such a heavily volcanic planet break apart or cool <br/>
down?; why does the space ship break up/burn up on re-entry when <br/>
they rescue Palpatine? what&#39;s a laser? the whole realm of robotics <br/>
is up for grabs here too. Art/music are important - the music cues <br/>
and feeds off the action - odds are your son can tell just by <br/>
listening, which part it is, which characters are involved, and so <br/>
on. The artistic and creative imaginings to make the planetscapes <br/>
and creatures/aliens and all - not to mention how they tie in to the <br/>
model making, CG, make up/costume fields.<br/>
<br/>
So, yeah, there&#39;s probably a lot you could whip together if you <br/>
needed that sort of thing. The bigger issue, though, seems to be the <br/>
idea of separating &quot;educational&quot; from everything else in life.It can <br/>
be hard for the person who isn&#39;t home to see how things flow <br/>
together. Even though I could put together a list of stuff, I might <br/>
choose to instead ask more questions, find out what is behind the <br/>
questions being asked - what are the concerns involved? Then, format <br/>
the answer using his own frames of reference - what does he love? <br/>
does he learn from exploring it? If so, then make the connection <br/>
that *learning* occurs all over the place, whether it &#39;fits&#39; the <br/>
school/education model.<br/>

that it can always be put in a school subject<br/>
category.<br/>
<br/>
But if you must, Star Wars can lead to an interest in<br/>
space and then to an interest in science. Or it could<br/>
lead to an interest in martial arts - jedi knights<br/>
style. Or it may not lead anywhere immediately and<br/>
that&#39;s OK too. We learn by making connections. The<br/>
more things we experience the more dots we gather,<br/>
that enable us to make more connections. Many of the<br/>
dots cannot be seen till we have connected other dots.<br/>
<br/>
Ugh! I cannot explain this at all. I have an idea in<br/>
my mind that I cannot put in words. So I&#39;ll just<br/>
redirect to other people.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-400907366">Thanks, Deb!  Both Tristan and I have read a number of the books so we were able to tackle that question...it just happened to be the first one to pop into my head (so I included it in my post).  The books often give so much more insight into these types of things.  That is one thing that Tristan really enjoys about the books, whether they are novelizations of the movies themselves or just a spinoff from them. :o)<br/>
