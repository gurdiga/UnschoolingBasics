<div id="ygrps-yiv-881250614">I want to thank the responders to my original post. THANK YOU for <br/>
your time and wisdom. :)<br/>
But I also want to add that I think the issue I&#39;m more concerned <br/>
about is that she (dd)feels lonely. She has a limited # of friends, <br/>
(which is fine - I try to explain to her that quantity is not the <br/>
same as quality) and the friends she has are from more rigid <br/>
homeschool families, so we have to &quot;plan&quot; time to see them and it&#39;s <br/>
not often. She wants more friends her age, but how does she <br/>
naturally go about making them? All the suggestions I offered were <br/>
ways she could meet more people and then perhaps connect with <br/>
someone. She is shy and reserved and doesn&#39;t like to hang out at the <br/>
mall or what have you. We do tons of stuff together that she and I <br/>
both enjoy: libaray, shopping, swimming pool, berry picking, <br/>
crafting, park days, etc. She has interetsts that she follows. I&#39;m <br/>
not as worried about that. For the most part we live a very free and <br/>
unprocessed life, it&#39;s the fact that she feels lonely sometimes and <br/>
wishes she had more friends. Again, I think this is because she <br/>
can&#39;t see her best friend as often, and it breaks my heart. I know <br/>
that being involved in an activity is no guarantee that she will <br/>
make friends, and I treasure the time that I spend with her because <br/>
she considers me a friend. It boils down to the fact that when your <br/>
children are sad, you are sad. I just want to help her in some way. <br/>
I am trying to find more unschoolers in our area for both of us!<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
<br/>
