<div id="ygrps-yiv-675362971">I&#39;ve been reading the threads here about limits, etc. and I&#39;m struck<br/>
by two things:<br/>
<br/>
1) I am SO freakin&#39; grateful for this list, and for families that have<br/>
made these leaps of faith before me, and are willing to share their<br/>
stories and experiences here. There were times in the beginning that I<br/>
was *totally* going by faith, because of the experience of other<br/>
unschooling parents. <br/>
<br/>
2) When I think of my *own* habits... ok, I don&#39;t even like the word<br/>
habit - it&#39;s all choices, every day. But when I think of my own<br/>
choices, what I choose doesn&#39;t come from having the &quot;healthier&quot; choice<br/>
forced upon me. When I notice that I&#39;m making less-than-healthy<br/>
choices, there&#39;s usually something going on *inside*. If I&#39;m reaching<br/>
for cookies, or craving something like these apple dumplings I made<br/>
recently - with TWO Sticks of Butter and a CAN of Mountain Dew!! -<br/>
it&#39;s usually because there is a feeling I&#39;m having, that I&#39;m not quite<br/>
ready to face. Well, sometimes, it&#39;s because it tastes good and is<br/>
fun, but I am an emotional eater. Because I&#39;ve had the awareness that<br/>
I am, I am now apt to get out my journal and try to get things out on<br/>
paper, before I get out the baking pan, or hit the drive thru. This<br/>
awareness came from knowing *myself*. I had to get to know myself as<br/>
an adult, because I wasn&#39;t allowed to do that as a child.<br/>
<br/>
THAT&#39;S one of the reasons my kids have total freedom to choose what<br/>
they eat, when they eat, and where they eat it. I want them to know<br/>
their *own* selves, not get caught up in whether it&#39;s right or wrong<br/>
to eat something.<br/>
<br/>
I am 42. I can eat as much or as little as I please, of whatever I<br/>
please. I can brush my teeth or not. I can even DRIVE to the fast-food<br/>
place when I want, and eat what I want there. I&#39;m the one with the<br/>
debit card, so I can buy what I choose at the grocery store. Why<br/>
aren&#39;t I choosing *only* sweets and Dorito&#39;s, and filling my cart with<br/>
stuff that&#39;s barely food? Because I prefer how I feel when I eat food<br/>
as close to the source as possible, mindfully. *I* feel *better* when<br/>
I eat that way. Why do I brush my teeth? Because my mouth feels better<br/>
when I do, and actually, I&#39;ve found my mood is better, too. I found<br/>
that out by *not* brushing my teeth. I had to give *myself* total<br/>
freedom when we started this journey, too. Now - *everything* is a<br/>
choice. Everything. I don&#39;t do things because my mom told me it would<br/>
be good for me. I do things because I WANT to, because of how my<br/>
choices make me feel.<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t that the reason someone would choose water over soda? It&#39;s not<br/>
because their mom controlled their drink choices as a child - it&#39;s<br/>
because they&#39;ve seen for themselves how they feel when they drink<br/>
soda, and how they feel when they drink water, and they prefer how<br/>
they feel when they drink water.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s scary, this choice thing, because that puts the responsibility<br/>
for my life and for how I&#39;m feeling, squarely in my lap. Yikes! But I<br/>
absolutely would not have it any other way. This IS my life. It&#39;s so<br/>
funny, I woke up this morning, took the dog for a nice long walk and<br/>
came back to watch the latest Oprah/Eckhart video. I sat at the<br/>
computer desk, and saw a couple dirty cups, some papers piled around,<br/>
some papers spilled on the floor, some cough drop wrappers, a<br/>
Bionicle, an empty Easter basket - and the thought came to my mind<br/>
&quot;This is the day the Lord has made. Rejoice and be glad in it.&quot; And I<br/>
*cracked UP*, here, alone at the computer, because I thought - I DID<br/>
make this day. I *did* create this, this mess is *absolutely perfect*,<br/>
it is MINE, I have ownership over it, I can clean it up or leave it<br/>
here, and either way would be PERFECT. I *no longer clean up because<br/>
my mother thinks I should*. This is HUGE for me. I don&#39;t want my kids<br/>
to wait to get to 42 before they feel that ownership for THEIR lives.<br/>
They can have it NOW - with me, with my guidance and experience and<br/>
love to help them, and the guidance and experience and love of lots of<br/>
other folks in their lives.<br/>
<br/>
No habits, choices. It&#39;s ALL choices. Made as mindfully as possible.<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>

<br/>
What a power packed post!  I read it and re-read parts of it.  Just<br/>
Wonderful!!!  As I was making my daily breve just moments ago, pondering on<br/>
the play day we have set up for today, I started thinking about what would<br/>
be &#39;appropriate&#39; snacks to take to a play date with a vegan family.  Then I<br/>
stopped myself and thought, bull****, I&#39;ll take whatever my children WANT to<br/>
take, and if it&#39;s goldfish crackers, so be it!  We&#39;ve got a whole group of<br/>
very good friends here who are way into nutrition, and some never, ever let<br/>
their children have sugar in any form, things like that.  And my kid (3yo)<br/>
takes a root beer to our Earth Day celebration! lol!! ;)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so grateful, as you are, that I&#39;m free of the fear driven crap; what<br/>
will people think, omg, what if, what if, what if...<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s so much more joyful to see my children have a large and<br/>
expanding-every-day world of choices, rather than a narrow, skewed pool of<br/>
just a few.  (and it&#39;s kinda funny watching the other children watch *my*<br/>
children eating/drinking what they choose...they just get this look in their<br/>
eye)<br/>
<br/>
Again, thanks for the post!  It was a good one!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1657285986">If the snacks are solely for your kids, go for it. But, if it&#39;s a kind<br/>
of &quot;pooled resources&quot; snack time, I&#39;ve often taken that into<br/>
consideration and tried to bring something that is okay with us and not<br/>
&quot;offensive&quot; to the others who might want to be snacking on it. We&#39;ll<br/>
generally not bring peanut containing items to group activities for<br/>
instance. I might mention to DS as we&#39;re packing snacks that &quot;Billy&#39;s<br/>
family prefers to have vegan foods - what stuff do we have that Billy<br/>
might like?&quot; (Aside: DS is almost 10 and knows what&#39;s vegan, what&#39;s<br/>
vegetarian, and what&#39;s &quot;omnivore&quot; - often he&#39;ll look at our meal and say<br/>
&quot;This is a vegan meal&quot; or &quot;this is a really omnivore meal&quot;) He&#39;s usually<br/>
pretty amenable to looking for something suitable as a compromise<br/>
because he knows he&#39;s not *required* to do it nor is he limited when<br/>
we&#39;re at home or out other places (although we do tend toward a<br/>
plant-based diet at home). Sometimes we&#39;ll bring a couple different<br/>
types of items - maybe some of DS&#39; favorite cookies (not vegan, some are<br/>
vegetarian though, generally organic either way) AND some home made<br/>
trail mix (dried fruits, nuts, fruit juice sweetened chocolate chips -<br/>
some vegans won&#39;t eat regular sugar because sometimes it&#39;s processed<br/>
using bone char from animals) - both items DS likes and at least one<br/>
that&#39;s suitable for vegans to share.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes. When you&#39;re filled to the brim with freedom you&#39;ll be generous  <br/>
with the freedom to limit yourself for the sake of others.<br/>
<br/>
When you allow yourself to feel controlled, you&#39;ll want to grasp  <br/>
control and damn what others think.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1951763294">I&#39;ve posted the thread on this below... as i changed the topic.<br/>
<br/>
Wrt habits.... i find that they are not a choice always.  perhaps you don&#39;t<br/>
get up early from doing it all those years.  but i still do i get up and<br/>
then choose to go back to bed.  there are many habits that i can choose to<br/>
leave behind... but my brain still is catching up... so i find i&#39;m still<br/>
waking around 6-7 every morning... unless i&#39;m bone tired....  and its been<br/>
about 15 years since i left that regime like lifestyle.<br/>
also... water drinking is something i&#39;ve wanted to do... so i tried to make<br/>
a conscious choice by making it an everyday thing... i taped a note to the<br/>
fridge and asked my partner and kids to remind me... and sure enough....<br/>
ever since then .. its been a year or more... and i&#39;m still reminded of<br/>
water early in the morning... even as i drink my coffee.  sometimes i choose<br/>
to drink water first.<br/>
<br/>
i was talking about the creation of a habit based on choice. and old habits<br/>
can be annoying.... so making a new one has to be a conscious choice. i was<br/>
talking about my efforts at remembering to stop and think... before<br/>
reacting.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you and i understand each other on this topic.  and if<br/>
everything could be perfectly expressed in words then life woudl be<br/>
differnet.  i guess i get people better when i meet them and speak face to<br/>
face.<br/>
<br/>
anyway thanks for trying to clarify what you think about this.<br/>
best, hema<br/>
<br/>
from hema:<br/>
Some one said... creating new habits requires us to stay with<br/>
something consistently for 21 days... thats how long it takes the<br/>
brain to make new synapses. so then on you will probably have it down<br/>
to a habit... or at least your brain will remind you that its<br/>
something you should do. For e.g. i started my day with 2 glasses of<br/>
water for 21 days (this was about a year ago).... and sure enough<br/>
although its been so long... i&#39;m still reminded to drink water every<br/>
morning as i make my coffee pot ready. not that i always listen to my<br/>
brain. so as i really want to create a habit of stop and think before<br/>
reacting (to messes or whatever)... then it takes consistent effort.<br/>
and its paying off for sure :-)<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard that too.<br/>
<br/>
Oddly enough, 12 years of schooling doesn&#39;t form the &quot;habit&quot; of getting<br/>
up early every day.<br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t want to live by &quot;habit.&quot; I want to make conscious choices<br/>
every single moment.<br/>
<br/>
Your water drinking isn&#39;t a &quot;habit.&quot; It&#39;s a choice. A choice you make<br/>
every day.<br/>
