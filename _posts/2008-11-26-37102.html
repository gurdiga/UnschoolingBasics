<div id="ygrps-yiv-1645863796">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m searching for a recent post (not even sure if it was on this<br/>
board!).  It was a thought-provoking poem about a young child in<br/>
school who&#39;s natural curiosity is constantly thwarted by the teacher&#39;s<br/>
instructions to &quot;do it this way&quot; etc.  The poem is progressive, and by<br/>
the end, the child has lost all creativity, so that when under a more<br/>
free teacher who encourages the children to do their art however they<br/>
want, the child no longer has any confidence in their own choices and<br/>
keeps asking, &quot;But what colour should I do it?&quot; etc.<br/>
<br/>
Is anyone familiar with the poem?  Do you think it was on this Board?<br/>
 I&#39;m trying to find it, to share with an artistic friend who&#39;s<br/>
thinking of unschooling her daughter.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Karen A</div>

It&#39;s a song by the late Harry Chapin.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Flowers are Red<br/>
<br/>
The little boy went first day of school<br/>
He got some crayons and started to draw<br/>
He put colors all over the paper<br/>
For colors was what he saw<br/>
And the teacher said.. What you doin&#39; young man<br/>
I&#39;m paintin&#39; flowers he said<br/>
She said... It&#39;s not the time for art young man<br/>
And anyway flowers are green and red<br/>
There&#39;s a time for everything young man<br/>
And a way it should be done<br/>
You&#39;ve got to show concern for everyone else<br/>
For you&#39;re not the only one<br/>
<br/>
And she said...<br/>
Flowers are red young man<br/>
Green leaves are green<br/>
There&#39;s no need to see flowers any other way<br/>
Than they way they always have been seen<br/>
<br/>
But the little boy20said...<br/>
There are so many colors in the rainbow<br/>
So many colors in the morning sun<br/>
So many colors in the flower and I see every one<br/>
<br/>
Well the teacher said.. You&#39;re sassy<br/>
There&#39;s ways that things should be<br/>
And you&#39;ll paint flowers the way they are<br/>
So repeat after me.....<br/>
<br/>
And she said...<br/>
Flowers are red young man<br/>
Green leaves are green<br/>
There&#39;s no need to see flowers any other way<br/>
Than they way they always have been seen<br/>
<br/>
But the little boy said...<br/>
There are so many colors in the rainbow<br/>
So many colors in the morning sun<br/>
So many colors in the flower and I see every one<br/>
<br/>
The teacher put him in a corner<br/>
She said.. It&#39;s for your own good..<br/>
And you won&#39;t come out &#39;til you get it right<br/>
And are responding like you should<br/>
Well finally he got lonely<br/>
Frightened thoughts filled his head<br/>
And he went up to the teacher<br/>
And this is what he said.. and he said<br/>
<br/>
Flowers are red, green leaves are green<br/>
There&#39;s no need to see flowers any other way<br/>
Than the way they always have been seen<br/>
<br/>
Time went by like it always does<br/>
And they moved to another town<br/>
And the little boy went to another school<br/>
And this is what he found<br/>
The teacher there was smilin&#39;<br/>
She said...Painting should be fun<br/>
And there are so many colors in a flower<br/>
So let&#39;s use every one<br/>
<br/>
But that little boy painted flowers<br/>
In neat rows of green and red<br/>
And when the teacher asked him why<br/>
This is what he said.. and he said<br/>
<br/>
Flowers are red, green leaves are green<br/>
There&#39;s no need to see flowers any other=2<br/>
0way<br/>
Than the way they always have been seen. <br/>
<br/>
But there still must be a way to have our children say . . .<br/>
<br/>
There are so many colors in the rainbow<br/>
So many colors in the morning sun<br/>
So many colors in the flower and I see every one<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2024618082">Thanks heaps for that Kelly.  That sure is the poem I was looking for!<br/>
 My friend, who&#39;s an artist and who&#39;s considering NOT sending her<br/>
oldest daughter to school next year, will really enjoy reading (and<br/>
watching!!) that.<br/>
