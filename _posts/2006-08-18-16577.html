<div id="ygrps-yiv-1722835061">&quot;I don&#39;t need advice on unschooling, I need advice on how to help my<br/>
daughter with higher math BECAUSE SHE WANTS TO KNOW!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ok, but that&#39;s a far cry from helping her get a certain amount of math<br/>
accomplished for the purpose of &quot;graduating&quot; high school. There are a<br/>
ton of great math resources out there for kids that are really, truly<br/>
interested in learning certain facts. I&#39;m sure Pam S has a nice list<br/>
of recommendations for things that would help a child when they want a<br/>
specific body of knowledge in that area.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a very different thing from trying to help her &quot;graduate&quot; from<br/>
WHAT?? She&#39;s unschooled. There is no graduation. It&#39;s just living life.<br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s interested in math facts, the last thing I&#39;d do is give her a<br/>
curriculum like Saxon. Yucky. I think the recommendation of F.U.N.<br/>
books is great...they have loads of cool stuff. If she&#39;s that<br/>
fascinated with it, maybe she does want a tutor or class. Our purpose<br/>
here, for this list and discussion, is how to help people<br/>
unschool...not how to help them get more schooling.<br/>
