<div id="ygrps-yiv-1037164464">Hi,<br/>
I am sort of new to this board. I have been off and on unschooling<br/>
boards for the past year or two-so I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ve posted here<br/>
before! <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know if HSLDA allows unschoolers to join? I did join<br/>
because every year I get anxious about my portfolio-and so far EVERY<br/>
year I&#39;ve had a new superintendent adding to the stress! <br/>
I had to sign something that said that I agreed &quot;To use a clearly<br/>
organized program of education to instruct our children.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s fine with me- I am confident that my program of education is <br/>
very instructional for my children-organized no, but the theory is a<br/>
clearly organized theory. Or am I just BS&#39;ing? <br/>
<br/>
I tried to contact HSLDA online to ask them this-but I&#39;m being lazy<br/>
and I can&#39;t remember my username or password to save my  life!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Cathy</div>

<br/>
Heck, they&#39;ll take money from you if you&#39;re a public schooling parent.<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;ll help you out in a legal difficulty though.<br/>
<br/>
The better question is, WHY would you want to give them your money?? <br/>
Please don&#39;t support their organization, there are better ways to get<br/>
help. THey have done far more harm than good!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What state are you in? HSLDA makes it sound like<br/>
homeschooling is very difficult legally and we<br/>
couldn&#39;t do it without them. The reality is that<br/>
people have managed to unschool in every state. A<br/>
local homeschooling group is very helpful in stuff<br/>
like dealing with superintendants.<br/>
