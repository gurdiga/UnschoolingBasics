<div id="ygrps-yiv-995755314">Hello, all! :-)<br/>
 <br/>
Was wondering if any on this list had any experience with Sudbury<br/>
Valley-model schools?  Anyone send their kids there?  There&#39;s one near<br/>
me, Fairhaven, in Upper Marlboro.  I just went to the open house today,<br/>
out of curiosity and as a just-in-case (in case girls want to go to<br/>
school or some other thing happens).  Cool school!  I know there are<br/>
pros and cons either way and we are happy unschoolers as I write this.<br/>
:-)  <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks!<br/>

response to similar questions is &quot;It depends &quot;:-)<br/>
<br/>
For one thing, the schools are independent so the culture of each is  <br/>
a bit different.<br/>
<br/>
Second the kids can have vastly different experiences depending on  <br/>
the child&#39;s personality and on the kids that happen to be there. The  <br/>
kids are more than just peers there. They implement the democracy  <br/>
model so the mix of kids in a particular year will have a larger  <br/>
impact on the environment than in a regular school. So some kids have  <br/>
said they loved it and some have really disliked it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Melissa<br/>
My daughter went to a democratic free school briefly called Balance <br/>
Rock.  She had only been out of school for about a month when she <br/>
went for the first time and it freaked her out.  She was 13 at the <br/>
time.  After awhile she went back though and really enjoyed it.  She <br/>
never went more than once a week because of the cost but she chose <br/>
the day of the week that had cooking which interested her.  I think <br/>
for her it was a good introduction into alternative education.  Last <br/>
year she didn&#39;t go at all but was interested in going this year.<br/>
<br/>
Balance Rock closed this year so a group of parents started Think <br/>
Tank which is not  a democratic free school but offers a variety of <br/>
classes and social opportunities mostly geared towards teens in a <br/>
pretty laid back setting.  We both LOVE Think Tank.  It is very <br/>
homey and comfortable and is closer to our home and on a bus route <br/>
so it&#39;s really easy for us to get to.   The peole are amazing and <br/>
the classes are geared to be appeal to the kids.  <br/>
<br/>
Like Joyce said though is depends on the kiddo and the school <br/>
culture and if it is a good match.  Like everything else in <br/>
unschooling it&#39;s all about exploring opportunites and being in tune <br/>
with your kid.  If it works out great, if not no problem.<br/>

I will need a lot of research and probably will have to visit some different places and see how they work administratively.  Will also have to research the financial aspect of it.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1760169524">My daughter toyed with the idea of attending school for a while so we looked<br/>
into this type school. Circle School in Harrisburg, PA. She wanted to go for<br/>
social reasons so this seemed like the best fit for her needs. Ultimately we<br/>
didn&#39;t end up doing it. She has a few friends that use to homeschool and now<br/>
go there. For their families it is their best option. Single mamas that<br/>
needed to go to work and the kids are just a little too young to stay home<br/>
all day by themselves. The kids love it for what it is, a social<br/>
opportunity. They play with kids all day and can basically do whatever moves<br/>
them. However they are obligated to be there daily for at least 5 hours a<br/>
day. They can have time doing other &quot;educational&quot; activities count towards<br/>
school but basically they need to be in school for a minimum amount of time.<br/>
We figured out that she would need to be there by 11 am which means she&#39;d<br/>
have to wake by 9 to get ready. that didn&#39;t work for her.<br/>

Sudbury Valley is ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Not sure if there is a connection to the town of Sudbury though  <br/>
they&#39;re near each other.<br/>

eventually. Not soon! But some day.<br/>

Playing around on u tube can be a good place to find things like <br/>
that.  There is a center like that in western MA called Morning Star <br/>
that has some videos on u tube.  They started out very small and <br/>
have grown because the concept works for lots of kids.  I too hope <br/>
someday public education can be set up this way to benifit more <br/>
kids.  In the meantime I am so grateful to have found a different <br/>
path that works for my daughter.<br/>
<br/>
As a sidenote Liz started a new session at Think Tank yesterday.  <br/>
Last session she took US Histry and Creative Writing and tried <br/>
French but hated it so dropped it.  This session I gave her the <br/>
schedule and she decided to stick with History and Writing.  She <br/>
also bought herself a camera and is taking photography and is giving <br/>
Spanish a try.  She&#39;s also taking an Art calss at a local studio.  <br/>
<br/>
When I picked her up last night she gave me a hard time because they <br/>
are offerering Algebra and why didn&#39;t I sign her up for that.  I was <br/>
joking with her that she is giving me grief for not &quot;letting&quot; her <br/>
take math.  I turned to the director and asked if there&#39;s space in <br/>
the class and there is so no problem she can take Algebra.  Another <br/>
instance of a kid who does not &quot;have&quot; to do anything and chooses to <br/>
fill her days with things that are interesting and challenging to <br/>
her given the right support system.  <br/>
