<div id="ygrps-yiv-1018317832">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I hope nobody minds if I bring this up here but I couldn&#39;t think of a <br/>
better place to ask for this type of opinion. We have four kiddos <br/>
right now and my husband and I are thinking of adding to the family. <br/>
I&#39;m always in awe (in a very good way) of large families. Can I get <br/>
opinions from those of you who are parents of 4+ kids. Did you start <br/>
off unschooling from the start or did you put the kids in school to <br/>
then subsequently pull them out (we did and it&#39;s been hard but so far <br/>
unschooling is fitting our family very well). I&#39;m curious about <br/>
unschooling in a large family and how chaotic things can get. Or is <br/>
it actually more laid back? It&#39;s chaotic here with our 2 boys (8,7) <br/>
and 2 girls (4,2) but sometimes the chaos is exactly what I like and <br/>
think it would be even more fun with more kiddos. Plus I&#39;m very into <br/>
pregnancy,nursing,and homebirths (our last two were at home) and <br/>
would love to go through it all again. I&#39;m getting certified as a <br/>
massage therapist and then expanding that into a holistic health <br/>
practitioner then into midwifery. Is there anyone here with similar <br/>
backround, or aspirations, or is working from home or even outside of <br/>
the home while maintaining a large family? I know there are soooo <br/>
many different family dynamics and each family has different things <br/>
that work but I guess I&#39;m just looking for experiences from various <br/>
points of view. Any takers?<br/>
<br/>
All opinions appreciated!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
I have nine children ages 26, 24, 18, 16, 14, 13, 12, 10, and 8. Our <br/>
two oldest went to a little country school and then public high school. <br/>
They were really rebels and I see the damage ps did to them. The next <br/>
two jumped through school hoops and came home at sixth and fourth <br/>
grade.  The next two helped us finally start the journey. One was <br/>
labled a trouble maker and one was labled learning disabled. I found <br/>
both of those lables inaccurate and dangerous. They were in second and <br/>
first grade at the time. The other kids have barely any school <br/>
reference at all. Other than tv&#39;s portrayal. It took us several years <br/>
to then fully embrace unschooling.Or really fully get it;]<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is wonderful with a large family. It makes so much sense <br/>
and my kids are so thriving.<br/>
<br/>
As far as chaos I do not see it anymore than any other house. I think <br/>
perhaps less in lots of ways. My kids are not coerced or controlled. <br/>
Allowing them to be expressions of who they are, rather than an act of <br/>
rebellion fighting against external controls. We have moments of chaos, <br/>
when they are playing games in the dark, running through the house, but <br/>
it is joyful chaos.<br/>
<br/>
I think my house is probably no more chaotic than yours. I often forget <br/>
how large we are. Until I see another large family get out of a vehicle <br/>
and then it like.. WOW!<br/>
<br/>
We went to the show the other day to see Iron Man and when bought the <br/>
tickets I said ten.. LOL. <br/>
<br/>
As far as fitting in an outside job stuff. I am not sure how I would do <br/>
that today. I do a lot from home. I am an activist and have several <br/>
small home business things going on. My dh works long hard hours for us <br/>
and me being gone very much at all would put a strain on our family. I <br/>
think if dh was home more I could pursue more outside stuff. I would <br/>
very much like to become a midwife, or a naturopath. I currently use <br/>
lots of aromatherapy and essential oils in our daily lives. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway back to the subject.. LARGE FAMILIES AND UNSCHOOLING ARE THE <br/>
BEST TOGETHER!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Also as a side note both of my adult kids are following an unschooling <br/>
model with their kids. I LOVE IT&gt;</div>

  Thanks so very much for your input, Kathleen!!  I so know what you mean about the chaos happening to be: running around the house, playing in the dark, etc... And ESPECIALLY being joyful! That is one of the best parts for me! Just watching them play (and getting in there right along with em&#39;) is great! Right now our two dd&#39;s, who are 4 and 2 (a very very agile 2) have climbed up onto the kitchen counter to sit with their legs dangling and they&#39;re singing loudly and acting out some kind of scenario. This is just &quot;the greatest&quot; for them cause they&#39;re &quot;so high&quot; and love to jump down and roll, while I&#39;m watching from the corner of my eye ready to catch and struggling about whether or not to tell them to get down! LOL. <br/>
   <br/>
  Anyway, I feel as though we have instinctively fell into what seems most like an unschooling way in the last few months, especially once I learned how to start letting go of my &quot;schooling&quot; mentality. And the boys absolutely HATE workbooks and are truly learning things on their own much more effectively than when I was trying to do &quot;school at home&quot;. When I finally left our 7 YO alone (we were in a charter and I quit) 2 weeks later he was interested in a book his bro was reading and so he picked it up and read through almost half of it. When he showed me that he was actually reading it, when I thought he didn&#39;t know how to read, that was my moment when I realized there&#39;s something to this &quot;self led learning&quot; thing. When the boys were in ps I was having such a hard time of it! And just watching them change for the worse was heartbreaking. I&#39;m so happy I followed my instincts to start over! <br/>
  As far as adding to the family I couldn&#39;t even think about it during &quot;our other life&quot;. I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d make it as a successful parent. I was failing them! Homework freaked me out and even with them gone for HOURS a day I was more tired then than I am now!!  Our lives &quot;HAD&quot; to have so much structure,schedules,rules,boundaries. We put ourselves into a box! My dh and I almost made the decision to have Zoe be the last baby &quot;final&quot;. But thank goodness we didn&#39;t!! And now have whole new perspectives and feel that a larger family would be soooo fun and fit our natural dynamics.<br/>
   <br/>
  Thanks again!<br/>
   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1413901723">Hi,<br/>
I meant to email earlier but the chaos is amazing ;-) LOL That&#39;s a  <br/>
freebie, I&#39;ll be good from now on. We have seven children, ages 13,  <br/>
10, 9, 8, 6, 4 and 2.<br/>
<br/>
We actually had our kids in school, and pulled them out when I was  <br/>
pregnant with Avari. Basically she and Dan are always unschooled,  <br/>
while the oldest two have LOTS of trauma, and the next two have some  <br/>
trauma from school, and Sam is our borderbaby, he spent a LOT of time  <br/>
at school as a toddler, both as receiving therapy and as the child of  <br/>
a PTA mom. The only hard thing has been helping recovery from school,  <br/>
the oldest two were severely depressed, they both spent five years in  <br/>
school. We spent SO much time healing from that, two years nearly.<br/>
<br/>
Having a large family can have its more chaotic moments, but I&#39;ve  <br/>
seen ways that it&#39;s easier as well. My friend has only one, and she  <br/>
works very hard to keep her entertained, and is driving all the time  <br/>
to find playmates. Whereas we have them built-in! Of course, being  <br/>
siblings makes them no more likely to play together, but it&#39;s worked  <br/>
well for us. There are times when I see how nice it is to have one or  <br/>
two, because you can focus so much on the interests of one child  <br/>
without all the hard compromising that we do for getting out of the  <br/>
house, going to outings or sessions when one child wants to, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have a paying job, but I was running an NPO for the majority  <br/>
of the time we&#39;ve been unschooling. I finally passed over the reins  <br/>
in January, and that&#39;s been liberating (my online time is truly  <br/>
MINE!) It was a good twenty hours a week. I loved the work, but I  <br/>
didn&#39;t like feeling that I was always having to choose between work  <br/>
and kids and me. Anyway, welcome to the group, I know there are other  <br/>
large families on here. Feel free to contact me offlist or to ask any  <br/>
questions about specifics. I like to talk!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-724390667">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I have five children, 12,10,6, near 5 and 22mnts. We have always<br/>
unschooled, except for one year that Ebhann, our oldest went to a<br/>
small multicultural school in Belfast N. Ireland. <br/>
<br/>
At the minute I am finding the everyday house work overwhelming. But<br/>
the children themselves, it is in a lot of ways easier than having one<br/>
or two kids.I have friends who have a much harder time with one than I<br/>
do with five, but then again their daughter is in school.<br/>
<br/>
Funny, I have not looked on this group for ages, as we were dealing<br/>
with some medical stuff and the first time I look back on, to search<br/>
for helpful stuff about bigger families, there you all are!!!!<br/>

   <br/>
  I checked out your blog spot http://startlingliv es.blogspot. com/   http://startlingliv es365.blogspot. com before I posted my original e-mail about having more than 4 kids. I love your blog! It&#39;s fun to read about your family and see the pictures. And it really intrigued my curiosity hence my post. Your family sounds a lot like mine and they&#39;re around the same ages so I was very glad to find your blog! I LOVE to talk, also, so you&#39;ll be hearing from me off list as well! Thanks so much for the welcome!<br/>
