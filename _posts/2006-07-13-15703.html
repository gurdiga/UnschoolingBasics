<div id="ygrps-yiv-1732971095">Someone posted about not wanting to watch the TV shows with her kids <br/>
because she dislikes TV. While I understand the sentiment, I think <br/>
it is important to know what your kids are watching and what they <br/>
like about it, especially if you are trying to strew things around <br/>
for them to enjoy. <br/>
<br/>
My son has been loving Pokemon for months. At first, I used the show <br/>
time as a way to get things done. Eventually I started to watch with <br/>
him and learn the characters and get the jokes. I was amazed at the <br/>
details he noticed. Then I looked for books and movies at the <br/>
library/book store that he might enjoy. We explored the internet and <br/>
found a Pokedex (which got him reading by first letters and sorting <br/>
them by type, he was mesmerized) I got him a few plastic toys which <br/>
he played with and held imaginary &quot;Pokemon Battles&quot;. I began to <br/>
battle him (verbally, you give commands) and his sister joined in. <br/>
Not much fun for me as his Pokemon always won!<br/>
<br/>
Lately, we have made up card games with Pokemon themes to give me a <br/>
fighting chance :) I printed out pictures of the characters and made <br/>
40 playing cards out of recycled cereal boxes. (glue picture in <br/>
middle, add values 1-10 in corners) We started out with &quot;WAR&quot;, but <br/>
it wasn&#39;t challenging enough for them. I did get to see that my son <br/>
knows what numbers are bigger than others, though. And that he knows <br/>
all the Pokemon names without needing to read them. And that Emma <br/>
knows most of them though she rarely watches. We made it more <br/>
interesting by adding coins into the mix. You get as many coins as <br/>
the number on your card (now called Hit Points) and throw down. <br/>
Highest number of &quot;heads&quot; wins. Both kids can count out the coins, <br/>
count the heads, and verbally &quot;battle&quot; at the same time. They are <br/>
starting to make up their own rules for games, like 3 on 3 battles, <br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
I found a site online that has great resources for TV images and <br/>
theme stuff. I printed off her BINGO &quot;call sheets&quot; for the cards I <br/>
made. We have also made the Kid&#39;s TV BINGO game which has images <br/>
form Nick Jr. and PBS.<br/>
She also has dominos and coloring pages and crafts to make for <br/>
seasonal or TV themes.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dltk-cards.com/bingo/">http://www.dltk-cards.com/bingo/</a><br/>
<br/>
Perhaps for the mom dreading TV, she could offer some related games, <br/>
imaginary play, dress up, computer games, etc. that involve similar <br/>
characters or themes that her kids will enjoy. <br/>
<br/>
Here, we are into making games because the kids like to play when <br/>
they get to decide on the rules and when it is something interesting <br/>
for them. My son actually plays WHOLE games of the ones we create, <br/>
whereas he dislikes most &quot;packaged&quot; games because he doesn&#39;t like <br/>
the rules or they are boring. It is also hard to find &quot;battle games&quot; <br/>
at a level for a 4 year old. <br/>
<br/>
Our first game was a kid D&D game we created with cards laid out <br/>
face down in a path. You roll a die and move along, picking up the <br/>
card you land on. There are cards to cast spells in battle, move <br/>
forward or back, gain defense with shields and cloaks, gain <br/>
offensive power with swords or axes, gain or lose HP&#39;s by eating <br/>
poisoned mushrooms or drinking magic potions, and of course many <br/>
BATTLE cards. &quot;Battle&quot; consists of dice rolling to determine if the <br/>
hero (the player) beats the current monster (drawn from a card pile) <br/>
We use bubble dots on the hero and monster cards to show HP&#39;s and <br/>
cross them off when &quot;hit&quot;. The goal is for the hero to make it to <br/>
the castle at the end of the path without losing all his hitpoints. <br/>
The game is always different and it can be played cooperatively or <br/>
competively. It can also be expanded at any time. This evolved from <br/>
stumbling upon my husband&#39;s dice collection from his D&D days. The <br/>
kids loved all the different shaped dice! Jacob tries to play D&D <br/>
with his dad on the computer, but it is a bit too tricky for him, so <br/>
this was a perfect fit for us. He loves coming up with new monsters <br/>
or treasures, etc. It makes it &quot;his&quot; game.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe some of this will offer up some options for expanding on TV <br/>
(or video games for that matter)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A couple to look for - the Star Wars &quot;Attactix&quot; figures (if you&#39;re <br/>
into Star Wars) - they have various things that actually shoot <br/>
(small plastic projectiles), object is to knock down your opponents <br/>
players. Each figure can move a set number of &quot;clicks&quot; (audible <br/>
click click click sounds) - number is marked on the figure - in any <br/>
direction. All 3 figures in play move on each turn. Then 2 of the 3 <br/>
can &#39;attack&#39; whichever of the other player&#39;s 3 figures chosen <br/>
(attack 2 different figures or attack the same one sequentially). <br/>
When a figure is knocked over, it is picked up and a marking on the <br/>
bottom is checked to see if it is white (it&#39;s kind of a roller wheel <br/>
that goes from black to white at variable intervals so it&#39;s pretty <br/>
random). If it is white, the &quot;special power&quot; on the bottom applies - <br/>
for example if disguised Han Solo gets knocked over and his marker <br/>
is white, you can put the other Han Solo figure into play from your <br/>
backup figures (if you have him). Other than reading the &quot;Special <br/>
powers&quot; there&#39;s no reading, adding, or other skills needed that <br/>
would be beyond a 4 yr old. Battles tend to run maybe 15 minutes or <br/>
so, depending. Oh, each player picks their &quot;teams&quot; based on the <br/>
point values of the figures - we play with 150 points worth of <br/>
figures (some figures are worth more than others) - so there&#39;d be a <br/>
little adding involved (almost fogot about that), although we often <br/>
end up picking the same exact assortments each time so we know that <br/>
if we pick figures a,b,c and d it adds up to 150 without consciously <br/>
adding them.<br/>
<br/>
If you can find it, there&#39;s a Bionicle board game where the board <br/>
gets built puzzle piece style as you play. Some reading involved to <br/>
determine the &quot;special powers&quot; of the various objects and all. <br/>
Mostly dice rolls and moving around the board collecting things.<br/>
<br/>
Battle Ball by Hasbro is sort of &quot;extreme football&quot; on a board with <br/>
dice and really ugly figures (monster types - cool for kids I <br/>
suppose lol). Once you&#39;ve gone over the rules, there&#39;s no reading. <br/>
There&#39;s a basic game and the advanced game - basic is just as fun, <br/>
just doesn&#39;t have some of the more complex rules. Different figures <br/>
use different dice to determine their moves (the dice are color <br/>
coded to match the base of the figure so it&#39;s easy to tell which die <br/>
goes with who). Object is basically to get the little football thing <br/>
(looks like a Monopoly piece) across the opposite goal line (like <br/>
football). Your opponent can &quot;tackle&quot; you by coming up to a square <br/>
next to you and you each roll your appropriate die - low number wins <br/>
UNLESS certain figuress get a 1, then they lose. The square where <br/>
the losing figure was (loser gets removed from play for the &quot;half&quot;) <br/>
gets marked with what looks like a bomb crater piece and is not <br/>
usable (gotta find a path around it). The advanced rules include <br/>
passing and fumbling and such.<br/>
<br/>
Check online for Lego BrikWars - you build houses and such with your <br/>
Lego collection and then use the Lego people as your &quot;warriors&quot;. <br/>
Requires assorted dice (6, 8, 10, 12 sided types). The basic rules <br/>
are in a downloadable format online. You can add to or subtract from <br/>
the rules at will, and again, there&#39;s a basic quick form of the game.<br/>
<br/>
And here&#39;s one DS made up called Squirt:<br/>
Object: To &quot;squirt&quot; all your opponent&#39;s pieces before all of yours <br/>
are squirted<br/>
<br/>
Checkerboard set up with 8 checkers on last row of each side &quot;the <br/>
camp&quot;<br/>
<br/>
8 Markers &quot;trees&quot; (squares of paper or cardboard work fine)  4 <br/>
each  are placed in the middle of the board &quot;the forest&quot;, by turns. <br/>
Only one &quot;tree&quot; can occupy a file.<br/>
Pieces can move one square in any direction on each turn<br/>
You can &quot;squirt&quot; and remove any opposing pieces that are in a direct <br/>
line with your piece in any direction, any distance<br/>
You cannot &quot;squirt&quot; pieces still in &quot;camp&quot;<br/>
You cannot &quot;squirt&quot; using a piece that is still in your camp<br/>
You cannot &quot;squirt&quot; through &quot;trees&quot;<br/>
You cannot step on a square occupied by a &quot;tree&quot;<br/>
When you &quot;squirt&quot; you maintain the space you are &quot;squirting&quot; from<br/>
You can move sideways in camp if you choose<br/>
You can always move back into camp if you&#39;ve left camp<br/>
If you get across to the other &quot;camp&quot;, you can remove one &quot;tree&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Can you tell we like battle games? LOL<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re right - it makes it better to be involved that way.<br/>

Thanks for all the ideas!<br/>
I especially like the &quot;squirt&quot; game and the lego idea since we have <br/>

I am trying to wean myself off buying so many toys and things and <br/>

Thanks again!<br/>

that both DH and DS have their own sets.<br/>

pick up some pool noodles when they go on sale cheap. Cut them in <br/>
half (they&#39;ll end up roughly 3 feet long or you can cut them even <br/>
shorter, your choice). Buy some PVC pipe at the hardware store, <br/>
roughly same outer diameter as the inner diameter of the noodle. Cut <br/>
that, or have them cut it, into 3 foot lengths (or whatever length <br/>
the noodles are cut into). Insert the pipe into the noodle, leaving <br/>
about 6 inches of pipe sticking out for a handle. Use duct tape or <br/>
better yet colorful electrical tape to wrap the handle all the way <br/>
up onto the noodle to hold things together. We also wrap about 4 to <br/>
6 inches at the other end of the noodle as well to help it hold up a <br/>
bit better since there&#39;s no pipe at that end. Makes a bunch of <br/>
somewhat padded &quot;swords&quot; or &quot;light sabers&quot; that give when &quot;stabbed&quot; <br/>
rather than impaling anyone. DH came up with this one when we were <br/>
getting bruised by the plastic light sabers DS loved playing with. <br/>
Now, we still use the light sabers (plastic ones) but his aim is <br/>
better and/or we&#39;re better at ducking.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-974401097">Deb,<br/>
Loved this part off the BrikWars site...<br/>
<br/>
Rules are for the small-minded and weak. Let a little kid loose <br/>
among your collection of bricks sometime, and watch the way he <br/>
plays. In his hands, those minifigs will have all kinds of crazy <br/>
battles and adventures, there&#39;ll be all the drama, death, and <br/>
explosions you could ever want, and the whole time that kid won&#39;t <br/>
have to crack open the rulebook even once. How is it that he&#39;s so <br/>
much smarter than we are? The answer is that most of us have had a <br/>
lot more years of schooling than he has. Wait until he&#39;s eighteen, <br/>
he&#39;ll have become just as slack-jawed and dull-eyed as the rest of <br/>
us. <br/>
<br/>
BrikWars has a lot of rules. If the mandatory education system has <br/>
had the chance to get its hooks in you, then you&#39;ll respect the <br/>
authority of those rules, because they&#39;re all written down in a <br/>
book, and some of them are capitalized. If things went so badly that <br/>
you ended up going to college as well, then you&#39;ll probably not only <br/>
shackle yourself to those rules but also then try to lovingly twist <br/>
them to your own ends, weaseling out loopholes and exploits to <br/>
cleverly frustrate the other players and ingeniously prevent fun for <br/>
the entire group. <br/>
<br/>
If you find yourself engaging in that kind of rules-lawyering and <br/>
munchkinism, then you have just failed at BrikWars. Stamp a big F on <br/>
your report card, schedule a get-together between your face and the <br/>
Hammer of Discipline, and see if you can&#39;t spend a little time <br/>
afterwards with a couple of five-year-olds to remember the things <br/>
you&#39;ve forgotten about having fun. <br/>
<br/>
The reason BrikWars has so many rules is that it&#39;s a lot more fun to <br/>
flout a large rules system than a small one. Hopefully you can use <br/>
these rules as a springboard for the imagination rather than as <br/>
manacles with which to enslave yourself. However, we also recognize <br/>
that not everyone is mentally ready to live without the safety net <br/>
that a system of rules provides, especially while in competition <br/>
with others. <br/>
<br/>
