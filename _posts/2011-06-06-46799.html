<div id="ygrps-yiv-830245574">I have been struggling with the education system for years. My son is a high functioning autistic child with type 1 diabetes. He has always been misunderstood and suffered greatly at the hands of the administrations as well as the children who attended. We now live in Lexington SC.<br/>
<br/>
I am very interested in unschooling him, but he&#39;s 12 and in 7th grade. Is it too late? How do I start? <br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-171339704">Here&#39;s a page with a whole bunch of basic links to get you started:<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s also a good idea to know the legalities in your area, and for that you&#39;ll need a local group - if there isn&#39;t an unschooling group in our area, unschooling is, legally speaking, a variety of homeschooling, so don&#39;t hesitate to ask homeschoolers, too:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/world">http://sandradodd.com/world</a><br/>
<br/>
But in terms of day to day life, a good place to &quot;start&quot; is by &quot;taking a break&quot;. Do fun things together, or just chill out at home for awhile - whatever works best for your son&#39;s personality. Spend some time reconnecting and re-learning how to live together as a family. That might sound strange, but school breaks down family bonds and you may find you need to learn some new family social skills when school is out of the picture. <br/>
<br/>
It takes some time for kids to decompress from school - its called &quot;deschooling&quot; - and while the basic rule of thumb is a month for each year of school, your milage will vary ;) Also, you can&#39;t really count the months of summer vacation into your expected &quot;deschooling&quot; time - until fall comes and your son knows he&#39;s Really not going back to school, emmotionally its just the usual summer break. During that deschooling time, your son may spend a lot of time daydreaming, or watching tv, or playing video games... whatever he tends to do to chill out. That&#39;s fine. Hang out with him as much as he wants you to, offer other fun things to do, but don&#39;t push. The First stage of unschooling is recovering from school.<br/>

<br/>
And while all that&#39;s going on, you have time to do more research, think about what you want, what you value, and get closer to your son. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-122726395">in addition to a big resounding yes to all that meredith said, I have a close friend with two boys who were previously diagnosed on the autism spectrum and she’s been unschooling for 4 years and they are thriving.  she’d be happy to correspond with you by email, if that’d be helpful.    let me know if you are interested and I will send you her email address. it assuredly NOT too late.  my daughter left school at age 13 – she’s 16 now, and thriving beyond belief. <br/>
warmly, lyla<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1279218775">The first thing you do is find out the legal requirements to get.him.out. of the school system - it&#39;s never to late to change course and look for something better when what is happening is not working. I would suggest you contact a local/state group for the ins and outs of unschooling in SC - this list is a bit too broad (international) to give you the kinds of information you need in that regard.<br/>
<br/>
Once you&#39;ve disentangled him from the system, live life. What does life look like when you&#39;re on &quot;vacation&quot;, when school isn&#39;t the overriding scheduler in your lives. Do you spend days and days hiking? Swimming? Gardening? Gaming? Drawing? Cooking? Do that. If you like getting out and about, act like a tourist and go to all those places the locals overlook because they&#39;re always there.<br/>
