<div id="ygrps-yiv-2110401937">Hi all:  I&#39;m not new to homeschooling (have from the beginning) but <br/>
am new to unschooling.  Do any of you keep records of what your child <br/>
does or accomplishes?  Or do you just live life!  I&#39;d like to know <br/>
what some of you do when it comes to keeping records.  We live in a <br/>
really easy state to homeschool (CT).  But legislation is trying to <br/>
change the laws (as always) and I sometimes think I should keep back-<br/>
up records some how.  How can I with unschooling?  I can&#39;t keep up <br/>
with the kids!  LOL<br/>

Hi  all:  I&#39;m not new to homeschooling (have from the beginning) but <br/>
am  new to unschooling.  Do any of you keep records of what your child  <br/>
does or accomplishes?  Or do you just live life!  I&#39;d like to  know <br/>

 <br/>
I have to keep records in SC.<br/>
 <br/>
I keep a daily log of what we do----just an appointment book with what we  <br/>
plan to do (otherwise it doesn&#39;t get done) as well as what we DID do, if it  <br/>
wasn&#39;t planned.<br/>
 <br/>
I also keep two plastic tupperware-y boxes into which I throw everything we  <br/>
do, every place we go and examples of their &#39;work&#39;. It all eventually goes <br/>
into  a scrapbook for each of them. The Live and Learn conference made these <br/>
boxes  really full, as we went to Hershey Park, visited friends in upstate NY, <br/>
visited  Uncle Sam in MA, attended the conference in Peabody (along with the <br/>
whale  watch), visited friends on Cape Cod, stopped in Boston for Blue Man Group,  <br/>
visited another friend in CT, and conducted an interview in CT for Cameron&#39;s  <br/>
new documentary. <br/>
 <br/>
Anytime we go to a museum, to a movie, to a reinactment, or OOT----or  <br/>
whatever, I collect the ticket stubs and/or brochures to toss into our boxes. I  <br/>
keep the print-outs from our library and from Blockbuster. Photos, artwork,  <br/>
written or math play go in.<br/>
 <br/>
I also have to keep &#39;attendence&#39;----by checking off each day we *do*  <br/>
something.<br/>
 <br/>
These are state requirements, but I don&#39;t let them interfere with our  lives. <br/>
They boys hardly notice.<br/>
