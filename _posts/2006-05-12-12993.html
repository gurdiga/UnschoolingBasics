bet that if you simply stop going out so much, don&#39;t have other  <br/>
kids over, and your husband doesn&#39;t &quot;handle&quot; her - constrain her,  <br/>
make her do things, etc., that she&#39;ll stop hitting within 6 months to  <br/>
a year.<br/>
How does one get a two and a half year old to willingly let her Mommy apply <br/>
sunscreen or at least keep her hat on?  She won&#39;t let me without force and she <br/>
refuses to apply the stick herself.  I prefer the chemical free natural <br/>
sunscreens which the rest of the family uses but for the resistant baby we&#39;ve tried <br/>
all flavors, colors, scents, creams, solids, etc.  We&#39;ve called it makeup, <br/>
candy for her face and everything else we can think of.  I bought a full body red <br/>
UV suit that goes over her clothes but she really does not like that.  I give <br/>
her the choice of the suit or the cream and she screams and runs away.  <br/>
<br/>
My issues:<br/>
Our family has sensitive, freckly skin (all strawberry blondes) and my 9 year <br/>
old just had three atypical moles removed from her head leaving 28 stitches.  <br/>
Atypical means that the cells were changing to cancer.  She had the moles for <br/>
years but they started getting dark around the edges and one had a bloody, <br/>
crusty center so they took them off.  She goes back in next month to have two <br/>
more removed.  We were told by the dermatologist and the surgeon that we should <br/>
expect to be doing these removals every couple of years at most and that our <br/>
kids should all have annual body checks.  <br/>
<br/>
We have the UV suits, and tons of other bells and whistle including wide <br/>
brimmed hats.  We also live in Cape Cod near the shore and have a heated pool that <br/>
is already opened.  We love the beach so we often go later in the day, etc., <br/>
but we spend all day, all summer, in our pool.  We have a huge market umbrella <br/>
that was great last year when she was one and clung to me more but I know she <br/>
won&#39;t be clinging so much this year.  <br/>
<br/>
I feel like I&#39;m abusing her by not using the sunscreen and I know I&#39;m abusing <br/>
her when we force her to wear it.  My husband tried to scare her by telling <br/>
her that she might have to go to the hospital if she doesn&#39;t wear it.  That&#39;s <br/>
worse for me than holding her down to apply it.<br/>
<br/>
How do others handle this?  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Robin, glad that there is no sun today.  Warped, eh?<br/>

that I would tackle.  It could be the smell, the way it feels on her skin,<br/>
the time it takes to put on, etc.  Find the reason behind it and you will<br/>
find the solution to helping her get the protection she needs.  Also, does<br/>
she see you putting on sunscreen?  Maybe have her do it with you.  Both of<br/>
you &quot;lather up&quot; each morning together.  My kids have just come to appreciate<br/>
wearing a hat.  I never had a &quot;hat baby&quot; and all hats ended up on the floor<br/>
within seconds of putting them on their heads.  In fact Emily hated hats so<br/>
much that just 3 hours old she was squirming out of her stocking cap at the<br/>
hospital.  She would push on them until they came off.  So I found other<br/>
ways to keep my kids protected from the sun.  They weren&#39;t as good as hats,<br/>
but they at least were something.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-59710196">It ain&#39;t sunscreen but.....<br/>
<br/>
My youngest son has hepatitis C and when he was 3, he had to have lots <br/>
of tests so we could determine the best way to handle his situation <br/>
(treat or not, with treatment being a year of daily injections at the <br/>
time).  He had to have blood drawn monthly, had to have a liver biopsy <br/>
and stay very still in the hospital, etc..  As you can imagine, he <br/>
hated it.  I hated it too, but the problem with Hepatitis C is by the <br/>
time you have symptoms, you are extremely sick.  Danny had no way of <br/>
knowing or understanding that he was ill.  He felt fine and Mama was <br/>
doing this to him.  We both cried a lot.<br/>
<br/>
It didn&#39;t fix the problem but what helped was me talking with Danny <br/>
about how I hated it too, about how I didn&#39;t want them to put the <br/>
needles in him either but that we had no choice.  Rather than working <br/>
with the doctors against Danny, I let the doctors be the bad guys, made <br/>
them be the ones to hold him down, and I just hugged and supported <br/>
Danny.  Sometimes we made up &quot;mean&quot; songs about the doctors or the <br/>
needles.  Sometimes we hollered and made threatening faces.<br/>
<br/>
Due to circumstances beyond our control, it was something that Danny <br/>
really needed to do for his health that he didn&#39;t understand because of <br/>
his age.  I wanted to not be mad at him for his anger but to be his <br/>
ally in handling his anger.<br/>

you let her put it on herself?  Have you tried the kind that&#39;s a spray<br/>

Maybe you were exaggerating about holding her down to apply it but no<br/>
wonder she hates it!  If anyone tried to hold me down and do something to<br/>
me I didn&#39;t want, boy howdy, they&#39;d be in world of hurt. &lt;g&gt;   Do you<br/>
want a daughter who will let people hold her down and do stuff to her?   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Step back and take a deep breath.  The most important thing in her life<br/>
today is not sun screen or the lack of it.  It&#39;s you.  She needs you on<br/>
her side.  I know it&#39;s easy to let fear take you, especially since you&#39;ve<br/>
had one scare already.   Don&#39;t let your fear get so big it blocks the<br/>
view of your daughter.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-25120453">I understand your fear, my grandmother had skin cancer, and we are  <br/>
all very fair skin, blond hair, blue eyes. Fear can&#39;t rule your life  <br/>
though....The good news is that you had preexisting moles that  <br/>
turned, rather than the creation of new blemishes. That&#39;s very  <br/>
controllable, and less likely to create skin cancer. Hm, that&#39;s odd  <br/>
too because my friend maybe two years ago went thru the bloody moles,  <br/>
and they removed them and said that the moles were benign, but the  <br/>
sign of the changing was indicative of too much sun exposure (or  <br/>
something like that)<br/>
<br/>
What about leaving it down on her level and just hoping that she&#39;ll  <br/>
use it? We have in our family Emily, who is very sensitive to  <br/>
sunblock, the feel is slimy, the smell is strong. So she really has  <br/>
to approach it on her own terms. She needs to be strong enough  <br/>
emotionally and be in control of it, or she really can&#39;t handle it.  <br/>
It helps that she physically gags, before unschooling came into our  <br/>
lives I probably would have ignored her more subtle ways of saying  <br/>
she doesn&#39;t like it. As well, Sam and Dan are both two boys who need  <br/>
control. They do NOT like someone else in their space telling them  <br/>
what to do. They have been unschooled a majority of their lives (or  <br/>
at least, *I* have been more of an unschooler on restrictions and  <br/>
such, even tho we started unschooling about nine months ago)<br/>
<br/>
So leaving the sunblock and hats on the table by the door and saying  <br/>
&quot;We&#39;re leaving soon, we&#39;ll be ready when everyone gets sunblock.&quot; Or  <br/>
maybe if you are very concerned about her medically, she doesn&#39;t want  <br/>
sunblock, you don&#39;t go. It sounds very exciting to live right by all  <br/>
that water and fun sun, but maybe it&#39;s not important enough for her?  <br/>
Maybe take her to the store and let her smell all the different  <br/>
brands and see if one is better. And I totally agree that she should  <br/>
be seeing EVERYONE put it on frequently. What about making it part of  <br/>
a routine? If you could bath her in the am, then have it be a lotion  <br/>
that she puts on. That gives her some protection for eight hours or  <br/>
so (if not swimming of course).<br/>
<br/>
After saying &quot;May I put some sunblock on you?&quot; and if she says no,  <br/>
i&#39;d ask if she wants to do it herself. If she says no again, I would  <br/>
say &quot;Would you let me know when it&#39;s okay to do it?&quot; and then wait.  <br/>
You could say sunblock is important to our family, and we&#39;ll leave  <br/>
when it on, but that sounds controlling. But if it&#39;s medically  <br/>
necessary, that&#39;s better than manhandling her (and easier, sunblock  <br/>
is slippery lol!)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, you&#39;re family has been through a lot with this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-346580106">Wow, the sunscreen issue, we face it every year too.<br/>
This year I felt it was my duty to set the example for our family by <br/>
purposely not wearing sunscreen and then getting really burned <br/>
shoulders and whining about it for days...NOT.<br/>
Oh, it happened, but not on purpose!<br/>
<br/>
We also bought powder sunscreen because Emma&#39;s skin &quot;burns&quot; when we <br/>
put regular sunscreen on, due to her eczema. It is <br/>
called &quot;Sunforgetable&quot; by Colorescience. Cheaper on Ebay than <br/>
elsewhere. It looks like a retractable makeup brush.<br/>
<br/>
I try to leave lots of extra time before we head out to put <br/>
sunscreen on in the house. I tell them it hurts to have a sunburn <br/>
and that we have fair skin and might burn. I ask for their help so <br/>
we can go sooner. Actually, I ask for their help or cooperation <br/>
often.<br/>
<br/>
Get her input on what would help...<br/>
Does she want to do it herself?<br/>
Would a spray help it go faster?<br/>
Is it smell/ feel etc. bothering her?<br/>
There are colored lotions that go on purple and then turn clear, <br/>
if &quot;fingerpainting&quot; is an option. <br/>
Could you stress the importance and then take her to the store to <br/>
help pick one out (she could smell and look at them all)?<br/>
Even a neat looking bottle might make the difference.<br/>
<br/>
We do insist. I won&#39;t purposely let them get burned.<br/>
I am not mean about it. I just put it out there that if you want to <br/>
go, you need sunscreen today. Let me know when you are ready...<br/>
<br/>
It usually goes faster if I do mine same time and put my shoes on <br/>
for that ready to go out the door look :)<br/>

z ups to put over the pool so that they can be in there all day, in  <br/>
the shade. Put your sunscreen on in front of her, happily, enjoying  <br/>

<br/>
I understand you really want to do things out in the sun, but it  <br/>
sounds like a bad idea for your family, anyway. So, it won&#39;t hurt any  <br/>
of you to take a year off from doing that. In a year, your 2 1/2 yo  <br/>
will be 3 1/2 and, IF you haven&#39;t turned sunscreen and hats into a  <br/>
major power struggle, will probably just go along because she&#39;ll  <br/>
understand better that you have good reasons for it.<br/>

<br/>
1. Maybe a poolside/beach lifestyle is not the best for a family of fair skinned, freckled and potentially skin cancer proned individuals. Just a thought. <br/>
<br/>
2. For those times you do go out, have you tried Coppertone Sport rub free spray? It&#39;s been a godsend for my sensitive daughter. You spray it on and it&#39;s a fine mist. No need to rub at all. I use it on heads and all over. It protects wonderfully and you can spray it on the run with really little ones so there&#39;s no need to hold anyone down.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, commercial over. :o)<br/>
