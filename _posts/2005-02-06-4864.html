<div id="ygrps-yiv-822532313">Actually, my Mom is the only relative with whom I&#39;ve even used the word unschooling.  With the inlaws, my Dad and even my sibs, I say homeschool.  I&#39;m pretty sure that no amount of explanation would result in my mother in law every accepting unschooling.  She&#39;s a retired K-3 teacher and my fil is a retired AF officer, and later gov&#39;t employee -- they just don&#39;t know how to live outside the box at all.<br/>
 <br/>
I mentioned the concept to my sister early in our homeschooling years, and she totally freaked at the very idea -- things like &#39;so then what if your child never learns to read?  Will you still be reading things to them at 12 or 13 yrs old?&quot;  The sad part about that is that I think she&#39;d have made a great unschooler.  She was the very in-your-face non-conformist teenager who dropped out of high school at 16, but somehow in adulthood she&#39;s become very conformist -- I think it&#39;s fear-based.   It&#39;s really sad to see her become such a traditionalist parent, with her son in a &#39;pre-honors&#39; curriculum at the mid-school level. Even sadder, her daughter in the 1st grade was struggling, and finally earned a &#39;bug&#39; (bringing up grades) award at the end of the year.  What 6yo needs that kind of stress?  Ah well, maybe someday when she realizes how much her daughter is like she was.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1843847133">&lt;&lt;&lt;I am very interested to know how others in your family react to<br/>
unschooling &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a positive story about family and unschooling:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My family is accepting of what we do.  (Or don&#39;t do.)  It doesn&#39;t come up<br/>
very often but once I wrote a long note to my father explaining unschooling<br/>
to him after he question if they&#39;d ever learn math unless we sat down and<br/>
taught them.  I used all the things he&#39;s taught himself (wood working - and<br/>
he&#39;s great at it, ham radio, lots of other things)   as an example of how<br/>
people are motivated to learn something when it interests them and I think<br/>
he got it.  He wrote back a brief note that he understood and I haven&#39;t<br/>
heard anymore.  That was maybe 2 years ago.  I used to send my mother<br/>
articles on unschooling and things I wrote about unschooling and I assumed<br/>
she shared them with my father, but either I was wrong or he forgot.  Not<br/>
surprising.  They can have big communication gaps sometimes.  Once, my<br/>
mother wrote back in response to one of my articles and said that she<br/>
thought I was doing a great job with my kids.  She isn&#39;t one to lather on<br/>
praise and that meant a lot to me.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My in-laws are great about it too.  Both of our families really value<br/>
privacy and not butting in where they don&#39;t belong, (an attribute of<br/>
Mainers, generally) so part of it is just that they don&#39;t want to be nosy<br/>
meddling in-laws.  The second part of the equation, I believe, is that they<br/>
think that we are both intelligent people who make good decisions overall<br/>
and if we&#39;ve researched something (which we have and we can debate it pretty<br/>
well) and we believe it&#39;s good enough for our kids then they trust our<br/>
decisions.  We were both the rebellious type though and we&#39;d do it with or<br/>
without their approval. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It helps that my kids are bright and curious.  We both come from families<br/>
who enjoy games and the girls can play any game with the best of them.  They<br/>
recently learned how to play Texas Hold &#39;Em and my 8 yo came away with $20<br/>
after a tournament.  She beat my whole family.  There were 11 people playing<br/>
that night and we&#39;d all put in $2.  I had put up her $2 for her, so her<br/>
winnings were $20.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Both girls have taken to emailing  my mil who lives in Florida in the<br/>
winter.  She really enjoys hearing from them and she always writes back.<br/>
That started in late fall and that has been the biggest factor in my<br/>
youngest learning to spell.  Spell check has taught her to spell.  She blows<br/>
me away, she&#39;s such a good speller now.  <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2000876013">Well, MIL and FIL et al are fine with it - they homeschooled DH&#39;s 2 <br/>
youngest sisters for high school (they were dx&#39;d with anxiety <br/>
disorders which made it impossible for them to attend school) in a <br/>
pretty relaxed manner - probably would have ended up unschooling if <br/>
they had had more years in. <br/>
<br/>
As for my family, we never said &quot;unschooling&quot; right off. We just <br/>
said we planned to homeschool DS (we decided before he could even <br/>
roll over!) We kept saying that and saying that and family saw him <br/>
growing and learning and having a great old time, without daycare <br/>
and preschool and all the &quot;usual&quot; stuff. Right around when he would <br/>
have started school (goodness, that&#39;s almost 2 years ago now!), we <br/>
started using the word unschooling interchangeably with <br/>
homeschooling when talking with family - &quot;we&#39;re going to an <br/>
unschooling conference&quot; for instance. What we were doing was no <br/>
different and they could see that DS was learning and doing great so <br/>
it was merely a matter of adjusting terminology at that point. Sort <br/>
of like boiling a frog - if you drop the frog into hot water, it&#39;ll <br/>
try to jump right back out. BUT if you pop it into cool water (like <br/>
its pond) then slowly turn up the heat, it&#39;ll never notice it&#39;s <br/>
being cooked until it&#39;s done. We let the results do most of the <br/>
explaining and convincing and then just added the terminology.</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My family just doesn&#39;t really understand unschooling.  We don&#39;t live in the <br/>
same state as they do so they don&#39;t see us in action.  My dh&#39;s family doesn&#39;t <br/>
know we unschool - we kinda dance around the subject when they ask us about <br/>
homeschooling.  WE know what we do and are happy with it, so we feel it&#39;s not any <br/>
of their concern if we are doing things how THEY think we should.  BUT, we <br/>
can&#39;t lie to them, so we are creative (the kids, too) in how we tell them what <br/>
we do.  My mil wants to question us about everything, and we satisfy her <br/>
curiosity - we only see they a couple of times a year, so it&#39;s not too bad.<br/>
<br/>
In reality, you are doing all sorts of learning.  Think about it in subject <br/>
areas when asked by a family member that wants to make sure you&#39;re &quot;doing what <br/>
you&#39;re supposed to do.&quot;  Talk about subject areas in a broad sense.  &quot;We have <br/>
literature, grammar, math and science everyday, and usually cover history, <br/>
social studies, &lt;whatever you want to mention&gt; twice a week&quot; usually satifies the <br/>
curious kin.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to try to explain unschooling to family members, and they want to <br/>
understand it and trust that you are doing what is best for your kids (are <br/>
their families like that? lol) then I suggest to talk about it bits at a time.  <br/>
Talk about how you learn all the time, and you follow the childrens interests <br/>
first.  Next time, go a little deeper, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
Just some of my thoughts and experiences...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>**We&#39;ve had mixed reactions, and one funny one.  We&#39;ve always used the word<br/>
unschooling and have been really open with exactly what unschooling is to<br/>
everyone in our families.  I was talking to my dad one day and said<br/>
something about the unschooling conference. He said, &quot;Why do you say<br/>
unschooling instead of homeschooling?&quot; I told him that we&#39;re unschoolers<br/>
because we don&#39;t teach our kids, etc.  He asked me a bunch of questions.  I<br/>
finally said, &quot;Dad, you know all this.  I&#39;ve been talking about it for five<br/>
years.&quot;  He replied, &quot;I thought you were joking!&quot; &lt;G&gt;   ~Rue<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1474847074">I agree with the others that &quot;homeschooling&quot; is the word to use in the  <br/>
beginning.  When people ask (that might see otherwise) what curriculum or  method <br/>
that I use, I say &quot;the benefit of not being in school is that you don&#39;t  have <br/>
to adhere to the limitations of school&quot;.    I say I have  done lots of research <br/>
on how people learn and apply these principles instead of  how schools need <br/>
to deal with a large number and wide range of children.   They usually stop <br/>
asking at that point.<br/>
 <br/>
In my own family, I just say &quot;homeschooling&quot; and &quot;meet the needs of the  <br/>
individual child&quot; except with my mother.  She was against the whole  idea.  We <br/>
just didn&#39;t discuss it.  Just after her visit at Christmas,  she told me she was <br/>
so glad the kids were homeschooling and she saw that they  were learning and <br/>
growing without the negative impact schools have on  kids.  The other day, she <br/>
told me how she defended me when someone was  saying negative things about <br/>
homeschoolers.<br/>
 <br/>
So, you just have to act confidently...that you know what you are  doing.  It <br/>
make awhile, but your family will see that your kids are  learning.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1538082298">My dear sweet mother in law and mom are both very supportive of <br/>
what we are doing.  I got so excited over it all in the beginning I <br/>
sent them em&#39;s with links and explanations. <br/>
  As for the rest of the family, what they don&#39;t know won&#39;t hurt them!<br/>
If asked, I just work around it, simply as possible. If they keep up <br/>
the questions, I go into detail about curriculum and websites, <br/>
worksheets, whatever it takes to get them off my back.   Most family <br/>
memebers don&#39;t ask anymore, and we&#39;re only in our 2nd year of it.<br/>
  There are those in the family, mostly one brother in law in <br/>
particular, that HAS to bring up education EVERY time we are around <br/>
him.  His latest comment was that kids that are uneducated cannot <br/>
succeed in todays world.  This coming from a man that has a son that <br/>
is 99% of the time grounded for bad grades.  Even keeping him of TB <br/>
teams in summer and BB teams during the school year.  <br/>
  No, he got no response from me on this one.  If fact, if anyone has <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-573470626">I&#39;m pretty loud and vocal about what we do. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My first experience with homeschooling in general (not actually DOing it, just being exposed to it by others) was so awful, I think others need to know how wonderful UNschooling IS! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d have started unschooling waaay sooner had I just *known* about it. So I figure I&#39;ll do my part to let others know that it exists.<br/>
<br/>
My car is a traveling advertisment for unschooling! Bumper stickers everywhere! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

So---to say the least, I get quite a few looks as we drive around town. I *really* love to pull ahead of cars with the teacher license plates----the ones for which people pay *more* to SC public education. &lt;g&gt; But I&#39;ve been known as a bit of a PitA &lt;g&gt;<br/>

So you can imagine pulling the car into the in-laws&#39; driveway! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m quite happy to debate the issue with anyone---all they have to do is bring up the subject. Most of them avoid it now! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They also know NOT to mess with my boys. All that took was *one* uncle to question Cameron about algebra---now they all just think I&#39;m a nut.<br/>

broken some ground last year when my middle child said something <br/>
about unschooling and my mom didn&#39;t freak out, but I found out that <br/>
wasn&#39;t the case.  Of course my mom is not happy with me because I <br/>
quit my job at her church and started my own business (Pampered <br/>
Chef).  As much as I would love for them to support me and (mostly) <br/>
my children in their growing without schooling, I know I probably <br/>
won&#39;t.  My parents have totally bought into the &quot;school is best <br/>
school is the norm children *need* school&quot; line.  &lt;sigh&gt;  So what I <br/>
have come to realize is that *I* am raising *MY* children.  *they* <br/>
have no say in what I feed them, how I let them dress, and how they <br/>
learn all the things that they want to learn.  I&#39;m doing nothing <br/>
illegal or detrimental to my children so there are no grounds for me <br/>
to worry that they would try to take them from me.  (Besides, my <br/>
mother has said on more than one occaission that she doesn&#39;t know <br/>
why in the world I had THREE children let alone ONE!)<br/>
<br/>
Be a duck.  Let it roll off your back.  If they have their minds <br/>
made up, rarely does it change.  *Sometimes* grandparents can become <br/>
wonderful advocates once they are proven that your methods work.  I <br/>
managed to raise three beautiful (bias), healthy strong children and <br/>
breastfed them for extended periods of time, yet my parents still <br/>
can&#39;t equate breastfeeding to how they turned out.  They can&#39;t see <br/>
the &quot;big picture.&quot;  They can&#39;t imagine that &quot;the norm&quot; won&#39;t work <br/>
for everyone.  I&#39;ll never have those supportive grandparents.  It&#39;s <br/>
one reason that our wills are set up so that if Dan and I both die <br/>
my family is not getting custody of the children.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-917272502">I operate on the same principle, but it has one small drawback.  When<br/>
people realize how far ahead my son is in areas and then they find out<br/>
he learned it simply because he was interested in it, they figure he<br/>
is &quot;gifted&quot; and we need to structure his entire day or we aren&#39;t<br/>
&quot;nourishing&quot; his intellect (he&#39;s bright, but nothing he impresses them<br/>
with is out of the ordinary - He just spent a LOT of time finding out<br/>
about dinosaurs, sharks, ocean life, spiders, bugs and other animals).<br/>
 I&#39;ve even gotten pamphlets for various preschools and private schools<br/>
with gifted programs.  Any comments I make about how obviously well he<br/>
is doing without this stuff is usually met with how well he would have<br/>
been doing if we strapped him down in an institution and force fed him<br/>
what an impersonal bureaucracy wants him to know (slight<br/>
paraphrasing).<br/>
<br/>
Luckily, we have plenty of evidence to back up our approach and it IS<br/>
hard to say that a successful result is the wrong path.<br/>

&gt; We found it best to use the term homeschooling until the family realized the kids weren&#39;t morons...then move into discussing unschooling only on an as needed basis.<br/>

&gt;   I am very interested to know how others in your family react to unschooling. I can&#39;t imagine my or dh&#39;s family reacting well to the thought of us unschooling. They would literally flip out LOL. I know I am way too sensitive to what other people think and say sometimes, even when I chart my own course. So how has YOUR family reacted?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2052855523">Pam, it is so refreshing to hear you say this.  Your dh&#39;s reaction sounds<br/>
like that of mine, though mine thinks the kids are missing out on a lot of<br/>
fun by not being at school.  Even though we&#39;ve always unschooled (my 4 are<br/>
younger than 8, so &quot;always&quot; is just a couple of years), I&#39;ve felt like I<br/>
wasn&#39;t honest-to-goodness unschooling unless my husband was a full<br/>
participant.  Even though logically I knew this wasn&#39;t the case.<br/>
<br/>
So, does your husband go to conferences with you?  Do you feel the need to<br/>
fully sway him to being in accord with you?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve dragged him along to a conference or two - but never to the really <br/>
good ones, unfortunately. It helped that he felt more that this was <br/>
something sort of legitimate, if there were conferences about it &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t at all feel the need to fully sway him to being in accord with <br/>
me. His attitude has changed a LOT over the years - he&#39;s way more <br/>
supportive now than at the beginning - but I mostly stopped trying to <br/>
talk him into seeing things my way a long long time ago. If the actual <br/>
unfolding of our wonderful kids doesn&#39;t persuade him, how could my <br/>
words do it? He&#39;s just not going to &quot;get it&quot; fully - my husband is from <br/>
Iran, from a persecuted minority religion there - schooling was their <br/>
road to a better life. His success in school is why he&#39;s here today - <br/>
living here, with a family and good work and so on. It is too much to <br/>
expect that he&#39;d be able to mentally just dump it all, as easily as I <br/>
have. I just expect him to go along without grumbling too much - to be <br/>
supportive of the kids activities and interests even though he&#39;s <br/>
worried because it doesn&#39;t look like school to him. I think, really, <br/>
he&#39;s kind of &quot;got it&quot; at this point more than he lets on - and he&#39;s <br/>
happy with them. But, truly, no doctors or engineers - so he&#39;s never <br/>
going to be completely thrilled.<br/>

As for talking about unschooling to my family...i&#39;ve never used the word and don&#39;t use the word when explaining to them and other non-unschoolers when i say &quot;we don&#39;t do school at home.&quot;  Then when asked how my kids learn such and such...i explain how they learn such and such..if they&#39;ve learned such and such - and if they haven&#39;t learned such and such yet...i say i&#39;ll let you know when it happens ; )<br/>
