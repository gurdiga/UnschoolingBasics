<div id="ygrps-yiv-1732401818">&lt;&lt;&lt; Sierra cried today when she found out the weather forecast had <br/>
changed and we weren&#39;t getting snow tomorrow night after all. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This reminds me of the time when I was a ski instructor at a resort in Colorado.  I had a lesson with a young girl (12) from Florida.  She had never seen snow before and loved watching it &quot;fall out of the sky&quot;.  I loved seeing the glee in her (as snow was so common for me, growing up in North Dakota and Colorado), and I got to see snow in a magical way that day.<br/>
