<br/>
Robyn,<br/>
  I agree with your post but have to say I have thought some of the same<br/>
thoughts as the previous poster.I thought I had worked through my doubts but<br/>
with our teenage son who wants to go into robotics I have found myself<br/>
wondering if I should have or should be doing something more on the math<br/>
subject. He understands all about electronics and motors etc. but still has<br/>
no interest in learning about other math that may be on the tests. I am<br/>
letting him make his own choices and I am hoping he will learn what he needs<br/>
when he needs it. I know that is not very confident but I haven&#39;t gone<br/>
through a child wanting to go to a trade school. <br/>
  We have known 2 families that homeschooled in a relaxed way. When their<br/>
kids hit their teenage/high school years they became very resentful of their<br/>
parents not keeping them up to grade level.I have surmised that part of it<br/>
was one families kids had several ps friends and it made a difference in how<br/>
they viewed themselves. The oldest daughter had opted for ps and shared all<br/>
she was doing or able to do.In the other family they weren&#39;t around other ps<br/>
kids but for some reason they were upset.Probably influences I knew nothing<br/>
about or things going on internally that I didn&#39;t see. That has been my <br/>
secret&quot; fear.....would love to feel confident enough to let go of it for<br/>
good.<br/>
<br/>
**<br/>
Of course if you spend your time anxiously watching for math &quot;teachable<br/>
moments&quot; to appear, and saying things like &quot;This is really hard stuff, so<br/>
don&#39;t worry if you don&#39;t get it right away&quot; even in your own mind, you are<br/>
well on the way to creating math phobia without a school to assist you.**<br/>
<br/>
  If your child is struggling over figuring out the answer are you saying it<br/>
would be the wrong wording to say...&quot;take your time and don&#39;t feel bad if<br/>
you don&#39;t get it the first time?&quot;  If so please explain.<br/>
This is something I would say or have said. If I can understand why it isn&#39;t<br/>
helpful it would help me.<br/>

 <br/>
There are books on robotics and there are people who build them If he&#39;s  <br/>
interested, he will ask the questions and look for the answers. Your job would  be <br/>
to help him find those resources.<br/>

Were they unschooled? Or were they still expected to perform? Did they KNOW  <br/>
that &quot;grade level&quot; is a non-existent measurement? Did they KNOW that? Did they <br/>
 enjoy what they were doing? Did they DO *any*thing? Did they have passions <br/>
that  were fed and nurtured? Did the parents? Were the children viewed as  <br/>
individuals with unique and fascinating qualities to share with the world? Were  <br/>
they celebrated as such? Did the children believe that about themselves?<br/>
 <br/>
All MUCH more valid questions!<br/>

  I am being open in answering your post.I have a feeling my answer may not<br/>
be right but here goes.<br/>
<br/>
First question: Why is he struggling over figuring out the answer? <br/>
<br/>
**because he doesn&#39;t know how to do it**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Who asked the question? Why?<br/>
<br/>
**most of the time it is a money problem he is faced with and can&#39;t come up<br/>

answer quietly but I know he is embarassed.Maybe it is more my feeling bad<br/>
for him and wanting to teach him so he won&#39;t feel that way.** <br/>
<br/>
Why wouldn&#39;t you just give him the answer?<br/>
<br/>
** this is where I think my answer may be out of sync with unschooling.I<br/>
haven&#39;t thought about it alot which is probably why my first response is...<br/>
because how will he learn if I keep giving him the answer? I know how it<br/>
sounds coming out but it is an honest reply. Clearly one I need to change...<br/>
because it will not help to create a learning environment.<br/>
  I feel like I should know better but the truth is I keep seeing areas I<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1933638364">&lt;&lt;&lt;I agree with your post but have to say I have thought some of the same<br/>
thoughts as the previous poster.I thought I had worked through my doubts but<br/>

when he needs it. I know that is not very confident but I haven&#39;t gone<br/>
through a child wanting to go to a trade school. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Rather than worrying about what &quot;may&quot; be on tests my suggestion would be to<br/>
get some sample or previous year tests from the relevant schools and let him<br/>
try them out if he wants. He will either find out what he needs to address<br/>
or that he already knows enough to go on with. Test taking is a whole<br/>
different skill from using math.<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;&lt;We have known 2 families that homeschooled in a relaxed way. When their<br/>
kids hit their teenage/high school years they became very resentful of their<br/>
parents not keeping them up to grade level.I have surmised that part of it<br/>

about or things going on internally that I didn&#39;t see. That has been my <br/>
secret&quot; fear.....would love to feel confident enough to let go of it for<br/>
good.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is 4.5. I have nothing to add to this except to say that I am<br/>
not about to start borrowing stress from one possible future, but parents<br/>
with teens may have ideas of how to either avoid or deal with these<br/>
feelings.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  If your child is struggling over figuring out the answer are you<br/>
saying it would be the wrong wording to say...&quot;take your time and don&#39;t feel<br/>
bad if you don&#39;t get it the first time?&quot;  If so please explain.<br/>
<br/>
This is something I would say or have said. If I can understand why it isn&#39;t<br/>
helpful it would help me.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My initial idea is about categorizing something as difficult *in advance* of<br/>
the child&#39;s experience - building something like reading or math up as a<br/>
tough skill to learn, just because the school culture must characterize<br/>
things as hard to learn in order to justify the structures and time spent on<br/>
&quot;teaching&quot; them. The child may not find the skill or concept difficult for<br/>
all we can know beforehand.<br/>
<br/>
From a wider perspective, I would never negate my child&#39;s feelings by saying<br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t feel bad&quot;. It is ok to be disappointed or frustrated. If you are<br/>
Unschooling, where is the time limit coming from, and why do you *need* to<br/>
say &quot;Take your time&quot;? When Jayn struggles with something, hmmmm I&#39;m actually<br/>
trying to recall an occasion when she has found something difficult enough<br/>
that she has gotten really angry. She tends to just ask for help, like<br/>
getting past one obstacle in one of her computer games, or stop for a while.<br/>
I guess I just validate it &quot;Gee that looks complicated&quot; or &quot;Oh, you have to<br/>
start again&quot;, or more often not make any comment at all. Historically she<br/>
has always been able to accomplish whatever it is, given time, the next time<br/>
or the next whenever. <br/>
<br/>
As Jayn has never been in school, the only residual schoolthink in our lives<br/>
belongs to dh and I - she has no concept of timed tests for example, other<br/>
than beating the clock within a computer or x-box game. The consequences of<br/>
&quot;failure&quot; are simply &quot;do it again&quot;, so no big deal.<br/>

I am  being open in answering your post.I have a feeling my answer may not<br/>
be  right but here goes.<br/>
<br/>
First question: Why is he struggling over figuring  out the answer? <br/>
<br/>
**because he doesn&#39;t know how to do  it**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Who asked the question? Why?<br/>
<br/>
**most of the time it is a  money problem he is faced with and can&#39;t come up<br/>
with the answer as quickly  as it is needed by the clerk.I have told him the<br/>
answer quietly but I know  he is embarassed.Maybe it is more my feeling bad<br/>
for him and wanting to  teach him so he won&#39;t feel that way.** &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
How old is he? Has he been in school?<br/>
 <br/>
Cameron (16 and schooled through 6th grade) is more aware of his math  skills <br/>
than Duncan (8) is----Duncan doesn&#39;t have the hang-ups that school taught  <br/>
Cameron. <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;d ask him sometime not &quot;in the moment&quot; how he&#39;d like me to help him  handle <br/>
it. I&#39;d tell him that I thought he sometimes seems uncomfortable in  that <br/>
situation. Is there anything I could do to help? I could give some tips on  <br/>
figuring out change or estimate what he might need to hand the cashier.<br/>
 <br/>
I blame school for Cameron&#39;s wavering and initial embarassment. Cameron&#39;s  <br/>
&quot;cashier skills&quot; &lt;g&gt; have gotten REALLY good since he started working at  the <br/>
deli. (Amazing how that happens----you know, how learning happens when you  need <br/>
it! &lt;G&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Why wouldn&#39;t you just give  him the answer?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>** this is where I think my answer may be out of sync  with unschooling.I<br/>
haven&#39;t thought about it alot which is probably why my  first response is...<br/>
because how will he learn if I keep giving him the  answer?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Uh oh! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I have a better question for you: How will he learn if you DON&#39;T keep  giving <br/>
him answers! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Duncan just asked me what 0 x 0 is. <br/>
I said zero. <br/>
Then what is 0 x 1? <br/>
Zero---anything times zero is zero.  <br/>
0 x infinity? <br/>
Zero. <br/>
Oh. OK---and then he asked for a PB&J.<br/>
I told him to let me finish writing this to you! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
They DO learn by asking----and by your answers---even if your answer is &quot;I  <br/>
don&#39;t know.&quot; They&#39;re making connections ALL the time.<br/>
 <br/>
He&#39;ll figure it out with your help or without it---really, but it&#39;s so nice  <br/>
to be a part of it! Don&#39;t close that door!<br/>
 <br/>
Try &quot;MathOutLoud&quot;. When I&#39;m figuring a tip at a restaurant, I do it  OUTLOUD! <br/>
10% of 76 is 7.6, plus half of that is another oh----3.5 dollars.  That&#39;s a <br/>
little over $11, but he was a good waiter: I&#39;ll make it  $15---that&#39;s about 20%.<br/>
 <br/>
OR I have $16.72 in my wallet. If we go to McDonald&#39;s, The four of us  could <br/>
each get a value meal if no one supersizes. OK<br/>
 <br/>
These are things I say in my head all the time. Saying them out loud shows  <br/>
that I just don&#39;t come up with them like *magic*. It shows that I actually <br/>
THINK  about these things and how I go about it. I&#39;ve also been corrected by my <br/>
husband  and each of my boys at different times when I&#39;m wrong! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I do it with language too----more for *their* benefit than my own, as my  <br/>
English is MUCH better than my math! &lt;G&gt; But that&#39;s the way they&#39;ve  learned what <br/>
prepositions, gerunds, and predicate nominatives are too! &lt;G&gt;  <br/>
EnglishOutLoud! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
In the kitchen: If I add just a touch of cinnamon....----BakingOutLoud!  &lt;G&gt;<br/>
In the garden: GardeningOutLoud.<br/>
 <br/>
You get the picture! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
First big step----to see where you&#39;ve been.<br/>

Keep walking! &lt;G&gt; You&#39;ll get  there!<br/>

the kids still thought of the parents are &quot;responsible&quot; for their <br/>
learning - or not learning.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is different - and unschooled kids at some point will <br/>
understand that they are doing something very different. In the <br/>
unschooling families that I know well, the kids would never think to <br/>
blame their parents for not keeping them &#39;at grade level&quot; because they <br/>
understand that &quot;grade level&quot; was never a part of unschooling. They can <br/>
learn what they want, when they want. They understand that far more <br/>
deeply than even those of us who chose to &quot;unschool them&quot; &lt;G&gt; in the <br/>
first place.<br/>
