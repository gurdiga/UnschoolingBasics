<br/>
This is absolutely untrue.  Melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer, can appear anywhere on the body, not just where the skin has been exposed to the sun.  It&#39;s possible for *anyone* to get it, but you are more *likely* to get it if you&#39;ve repeatedly tanned and/or burned your skin.  If you have a tan, your skin is damaged -- plain and simple.  Sunblock is very important, but perhaps even more so is avoiding the sun at the peak of its intensity (late morning to mid afternoon).  Many people think it&#39;s perfectly safe to be out in the blazing sun for hours on end as long as they&#39;ve applied sunblock.  That is also absolutely untrue.<br/>
<br/>
I am a very strong advocate for protecting ourselves from the sun...skin cancer is on the rise among people under 40 in this country and is especially prevalent among young women who mistakenly believe that indoor tanning is safe.  These are women who may never actually burn their skin, but who tan excessively year-round.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I didn&#39;t intend to hop up on my soapbox, but I am passionate about this issue.  I think it&#39;s one that people often don&#39;t take seriously enough.<br/>

  We don&#39;t use sunblock often around here.  We all tan pretty easily, and tho I burn occasionally, the boys have darker skin, so it&#39;s less a concern for them.  <br/>
   <br/>
  One thing to consider while advocating that all people avoid all sun exposure is that the sun is a prime source of Vitamin D, which in several studies has been shown to reduce one&#39;s risk of colon cancer, and maybe some other cancers.  In kids, not getting enough vitamin D can lead to rickets -- recently on the rise in some parts of the US.  When you block out the sun&#39;s rays, you block out the opportunity for the body to produce sufficient amounts of Vit D.  Sure, they put it in many milks -- tho it won&#39;t be in many of the organic or natural milks and certainly not in raw milk.  Also, there&#39;s concern that synthetic Vit D in such sources as milk and vitamin drops isn&#39;t metabolized by the body in the same way and isn&#39;t as effective as plain, old sunlight.<br/>

I didn�t research it before I posted, but I thought that I had read<br/>
repeatedly that it was burning that was cause for concern, not being exposed<br/>
to the sun.  I�ll have to read up on that again.  <br/>
