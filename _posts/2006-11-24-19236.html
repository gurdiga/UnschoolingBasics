<div id="ygrps-yiv-1794446953">Well I personally have a problem with all the violence.  Hubby likes to watch all the shoot em up, blood and gore movies.  The more dead bodies and blood the better in hubbies T.V. viewing time.  I try to direct our girls (ages 6 & 8) to the upstairs tv if he is watching this stuff.  Sexual Content does not bother me depending on what it is..........if it&#39;s some type of violent rape then I don&#39;t want the girls watching it. Swearing does not bother me if the girls see it......I figure they will eventually know all those words anyway.   My 6 year old does not watch tv much.  She would rather do any number of things than watch tv.  My 8 year old is obsessed with tv, but she does do other things.  Right now she is outside riding her bike.  My girls watch a lot of Animal Planet in addition to Nicholodeon.  Also Lexi my 8 year old watches that show on TLC about the women giving birth.  She loves that show, and she is either going to have lots of kids or become an OB/GYN.......not<br/>
 sure which......maybe both.<br/>
  I guess some issues have not come up in our house yet, like my girls only go on the internet for their Time 4 Learning program.  I keep hearing about all these internet sexual predators so I know the day is coming that I will have to address the going on sites like MY SPACE and e-mailing all their friends.  I have heard some horror stories.  Now last night my 6 year old stayed up till 11:30, but not to watch tv.  She was deeply involved in an Art/Craft Project.  My 6 year old does her best work at night........seems to be her most creative time.  <br/>

    If you have lots and lots of channels and your children watch TV <br/>
anytime they<br/>
want for as long they want and stay up as late as they want how do you <br/>
deal with<br/>
TV content that might not be &quot;age appropriate?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
We talk about things they have questions about. Often in way more <br/>
detail than the typical parent would be comfortable with.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=--=-<br/>
<br/>
There are shows that contain<br/>
images that can be very scary for a three year old or shows containg <br/>
explicit<br/>
sexual content that kids might not understand at, say,  6 years of age.<br/>
Especially on late night cable channels. Do you all feel comfortable <br/>
with them<br/>
watching whatever they find that happens to be on the airwaves?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Duncan, at ten, chooses Discovery Channel, Cartoon Network, Animal <br/>
Planet, Nickelodeon, and Disney Channel. That&#39;s it. I&#39;m perfectly <br/>
comfortable with his choices. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not to say that Family Guy can&#39;t be....ummm....sometimes uncomfortable! <br/>
&lt;G&gt; But that&#39;s when we talk about a LOT of issues. There&#39;s not much <br/>
those guys don&#39;t hit! &lt;G&gt; Opens HIGHWAYS of discussions!<br/>
<br/>
I like Law and Order and SVU and CI. Duncan won&#39;t usually hang around <br/>
when I watch them. Too violent with too much sexual (SVU) content for <br/>
him. He&#39;ll go upstairs to watch Cartoon Network, or I&#39;ll change the <br/>
channel (I LOVE TiVO! &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
Cameron, at 18 chooses That 70s Show---and that&#39;s about it. We all <br/>
watch My Name is Earl and Family Guy. Cameron likes scary <br/>
movies---Horror, I mean. I won&#39;t watch them---unless it&#39;s Stephen King <br/>
or M. Night Shamalan. But Cam and his girlfriend love to be scared. He <br/>
didn&#39;t as a child. He did it as he was ready. They like Saw. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Is their no such thing as &quot;age appropriate?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Sure---and at his age, he finds sex and violence to be inappropriate <br/>
for him.<br/>
<br/>
He even asks whether a movie is &quot;R&quot;---not that he hasn&#39;t seen plenty of <br/>
&quot;R&quot;-rated movies. Just somewhere in his brain, he thinks he needs to <br/>
*ask* about them---maybe due to TV commercials??? I&#39;ll say that it&#39;s <br/>
violent or has sex scenes or maybe rough language---whatever the reason <br/>
might be for the rating. But there&#39;s no movie with language as bad as <br/>
my *own*, so I know that doesn&#39;t bother him. The sex (even just love <br/>
scenes) and violence are enough to keep him from watching.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think a six year old child will CHOOSE to watch sex and <br/>
violence? Why?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=--=<br/>
<br/>
 Or do you excercise some kind of control, like<br/>
limiting the amount or kind of programming you allow through <br/>
supervision,<br/>
V-chips, not having cable or other technologies?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Nope. I&#39;m not usually far away if he has a question. We have unlimited <br/>
TV, computer, video games, TiVo, books, and most of all TALK. I&#39;m <br/>
willing to talk about *anything* with them---and I can assure you we&#39;ve <br/>
had some UNUSUAL conversations. About stuff that would make the devil <br/>
blush and wash his ears! &lt;G&gt; But they know I won&#39;t laugh or put them <br/>
off. If I *do* put them off because of the timing, I&#39;m *sure* to <br/>
address it at the soonest possible moment. They trust me.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  And if you do not limit TV content do you also not limit internet <br/>
content?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Nope---that either.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are too smart on the computer anyway! &lt;G&gt; They have to show me <br/>
how to navigate. If *I* thought I could put up some kind of workable <br/>
barrier... &lt;g&gt; No way!<br/>

<br/>
Do you think a child with involved, caring parents who are open and <br/>
honest with her will CHOOSE---or even be persuaded by---a predator to <br/>
go away with him???<br/>
<br/>
The kids who are targets are&#39;t ones who tell their parents stuff. It&#39;s <br/>
the kid who is *afraid* to tell her mom that a &quot;really cool guy from <br/>
the internet&quot; wants to meet her at the mall. Because she was on the <br/>
internet past bedtime or was on a site she wasn&#39;t supposed to be <br/>
one---or had figured out how to bypass the parental controls!!! She <br/>
can&#39;t confide in her mom then. So she&#39;s put in a situation she doesn&#39;t <br/>
know how to get out of. Should she confess what she&#39;s been up to---and <br/>
get grounded or lose computer access? Or lie to her parents about what <br/>
she&#39;s been doing? Or trust this really neat guy who seems to understand <br/>
her???<br/>
<br/>
So many parents are CLUELESS. They don&#39;t think things through. Open and <br/>
honest. Trusting and trustworthy. Respectful and respectable. THAT&#39;s a <br/>
parent who won&#39;t have to worry about *controlling* what the kids are <br/>
doing. They&#39;ll TELL you if they know they won&#39;t get in trouble for it!<br/>

<br/>
Well, we don&#39;t have cable, but we do own and rent movies that are <br/>
violent and otherwise scary to Morgan, plus movies with (light) <br/>
sexual content. We don&#39;t hide any of it and its all available all <br/>
the time. Mo finds sex boring - she&#39;s five. She tends to be scared <br/>
more by characters expressing fear than out-and-out violence, <br/>
although some monsters she finds scary. <br/>
<br/>
In the last couple months she&#39;s been really getting into watching <br/>
some kinds of scary movies - if she&#39;s intrigued by some other aspect <br/>
of the movie. She has this whole set of strategies she uses to get <br/>
herself used to the &quot;scariness&quot; of the movie - watching on a smaller <br/>
screen, in a different language, watching extras, fast forwarding - <br/>
that she worked out all on her own. That&#39;s something that wouldn&#39;t <br/>
have happened if I had just decided *for* her that some things were <br/>
too scary. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still learning how to talk with my stepson about movie content, <br/>
etc. I&#39;m more &quot;concerned&quot; about that, since we don&#39;t really have a <br/>
history of communication. <br/>

<br/>
We just proactively meet the need for programs that are preferred by<br/>
our son; so that the stuff he doesn&#39;t want to see isn&#39;t bombarding<br/>
him. He understands the DVR/TIVO concept and wants to watch &quot;his<br/>
shows&quot;. Sometimes, in the evening the channel will default to the news<br/>
or something that I am aware that he doesn&#39;t want to watch. I haven&#39;t<br/>
figured out how to keep that from happening for him. Technically, I<br/>
could block certain channels or block the tv access by time of day;<br/>
but neither of those provide the access that he desires during other<br/>
times of the day. So, he just turns the tv off or asks for help to<br/>
play one of &quot;his shows&quot;. Occasionally, he watches whatever is on and<br/>
either likes it or turns it off. <br/>
<br/>
My goal isn&#39;t to keep the world out, just to facilitate his own<br/>
preference for its presence in his life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2003682493">Well the reality of our situation is that we have a 6 year old that is special needs.  Both of her birth parents are mentally ill, and she may have inherited some form of mental illnesss......we are in the process of having her evaluated.  She has Aspergers Syndrome and Sensory Processing Disorder.  She has no ability to control any kind of impulse.  And it&#39;s much deaper than I could even explain here.  I have no way of knowing where she will be at developementally as a teenager or beyond for that matter.  We are very involved and caring parents.  For us and her it really has nothing to do with our ability as parents.  I have to protect her from so many more things than a Neuro Typical child, because she does not have the ability to know these things.  So I will be the parent watching what she does on the computer.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-597432852">No, mostly from TV.  But also my 10 year old niece was threatened by some kids from her school on-line.  It was a situation where she gave her e-mail out to way too many people, who gave it to other people, etc.  And then I&#39;ve had any number of friends that have told me stories.  One story was from a friend of mine who&#39;s niece was being stalked by some guy she met on-line.  But that was a case of parents who were not involved in what their kids were doing.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-110414547">I have one daughter who is very sensitive to those types of things and <br/>
will not watch them, even if she has the remote.  My oldest (almost 8) <br/>
will watch things like Law and Order and CSI with me, but will leave <br/>
or ask to change it if it gets to be too much for her.  It&#39;s hard to <br/>
tell with them because they LOVE Stargate SG1 and that has lots of <br/>
shooting and whatnot, but they told me that they know its fake so it&#39;s <br/>
not scary to them.  <br/>
<br/>
When they stay up late at night after we go to bed, they choose what <br/>
they want to watch.  Mostly its Disney, TV Land or Nick at Night.  <br/>
Sometimes they pop in a video.  I explained that I wished for them to <br/>
watch those channels while I was asleep - it made me less scared.  <br/>
They are ok with this and have agreed that it&#39;s ok with them.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the interent - I have a &#39;home page&#39; on our harddrive that <br/>
has links to their favorite sites.  When you open up IE that&#39;s the <br/>
first page they see.  Then they can go to their sites.  So far they <br/>
haven&#39;t discovered google or yahoo for searching yet, but I usually am <br/>
nearby when they have questions.  Most of their computer time is with <br/>
CDs we have with games on it.<br/>

If you have lots and lots of channels and your children watch TV anytime they want for as long they want and stay up as late as they want how do you deal with TV content that might not be &quot;age appropriate?&quot; There are shows that contain images that can be very scary for a three year old or shows containg explicit sexual content that kids might not understand at, say, 6 years of age. Especially on late night cable channels. Do you all feel comfortable with them watching whatever they find that happens to be on the airwaves? Is their no such thing as &quot;age appropriate?&quot; Or do you excercise some kind of control, like limiting the amount or kind of programming you allow through supervision, V-chips, not having cable or other technologies? And if you do not limit TV content do you also not limit internet content? And if you limit internet content through parental controls or whatever, and not TV content, why so? Kathryn<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-277578810">Yep, I have to agree with you on this one Melynda.  My girls just love everyone.  They do not have enough worldly experience yet to realize there are people out there that would hurt them.  And my special needs child might never be able to figure this one out.  I try to teach both of them about such things as much as I can.  But the preditor is out there thinking of things that I have not thought of telling my children......they are extremely savy.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-590962276">i&#39;ve seen this same thing.<br/>
<br/>
in my own home, i have a 5yo who watches images which<br/>
are very scary to him (body language makes it<br/>
obvious--he is halfway across the room, gripping the<br/>
back of the sofa with one hand and the other hand is<br/>
in his mouth) and he will NOT look away, leave the<br/>
room, or turn off the tube! it&#39;s upsetting to me to<br/>
watch him process what he sees. he asks many detailed<br/>
questions, returning to the topic day after day, has<br/>
dreams which wake him in the night, etc. <br/>
<br/>
i do protect him from these images as much as i can.<br/>
at least when reading a scary story from a book, his<br/>
mind creates the images and he ONLY sees what he can<br/>
&quot;handle&quot; seeing. this child is extremely imaginative,<br/>
spends most of his time in fantasy play, and is still<br/>
at a stage of development where he doesn&#39;t always know<br/>
fantasy from reality.<br/>
<br/>
ds8 on the other hand, loves to watch the special<br/>
features and learn how the &quot;scary&quot; scenes are created.<br/>
he has no trouble understanding and processing what<br/>
he&#39;s seen.<br/>
<br/>
i think seeing each child as an individual and<br/>
responding accordingly is crucial to successful<br/>
parenting. they can&#39;t all be expected or &quot;trusted&quot; to<br/>
manage all of their experiences at very young ages.<br/>
some need just a little help for a little while!<br/>
<br/>
my 2 cents,<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am not sure about that. Once while at a friends<br/>
&gt; house, she went to pick up her daughter from the<br/>
&gt; neighbor&#39;s house next door, where her 6 y./o was<br/>
&gt; playing. All the kids, including the three year old,<br/>
&gt; were engrossed in &quot;Silence of the Lambs.&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
&gt; Kids do not want to watch those programs . if you<br/>
&gt; leave up to them they want age appropriate shows. I<br/>
&gt; do not limit and my son now almost 4 and a half<br/>
&gt; wants to watch only kids stuff.<br/>
&gt; He also already learned how to set on &quot;his&quot;<br/>
&gt; channels. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>An unschooling family?<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a really important distinction. I can already see a Big <br/>
difference between the way my unschooling 5yr old approaches social <br/>
situations *and* new information compared to other kids her age. <br/>
She&#39;s waaaaaay more likely to include her parents as a source of <br/>
information and a guide to problem solving. <br/>
<br/>
My stepson is more of a concern Because he&#39;s learned that adults are <br/>
not to be trusted with personal information. But rather than <br/>
limiting his movies and internet we&#39;re working on making ourselves <br/>
available, respecting his boundaries, showing him courtesy and <br/>
trust, and letting him know that he is Worthy of respect and trust. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think of people as &quot;targets&quot; first and formost. I find it <br/>
terribly disrespectful that you would describe another human being <br/>
in such a way. Right now, today, my dss might not tell me if he was <br/>
looking at porn online. I don&#39;t know. I do know that last night he <br/>
watched &quot;Fight Club&quot; which has both violent and sexual content and <br/>
we just has a brief chat about that. Mostly to let him know that I <br/>
knew he&#39;d seen it and I&#39;m okay with that. That I&#39;m not out to censor <br/>
his movie-watching or computer use. I am interested in what he <br/>
thinks and feels about it, but I don&#39;t necessarily expect him to <br/>
talk with me about that, directly. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>NO-body is suggesting kids be left totally on their own to negotiate <br/>
the complexities of human relationships - be they friendly, <br/>
antagonistic, romantic, violent, cooperative, sexual, economic, <br/>
whatever! Of course kids need information and feedback from people <br/>
they trust - the important part is creating a relationship that <br/>
fosters that trust. I&#39;m not about to &quot;rest on my laurels&quot; and assume <br/>
that b/c my dd trusts me Now I don&#39;t ever have to do any more &quot;work&quot; <br/>
in the relationship, anymore than I&#39;m going to assume that just b/c <br/>
all is peachy between me and George at This moment the relationship <br/>
will always go smoothly. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have any guarantee that having an honest relationship with <br/>
my dd and dss will &quot;protect&quot; them from anything at all, but I am <br/>
Very sure that imposing restrictions on them &quot;for their own good&quot; <br/>
will undermine the trust between us, making communication and any <br/>
kind of &quot;guidance&quot; much less likely to occur. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-668927422">&quot;* Children can not always think things through on their own- they do<br/>
need us as parents for guidance. I personally would never lull myself<br/>
into a false sense of security of my child¹s safely based on my open<br/>
relationship with them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Guidance is very different from coercion, control and limits. Guidance<br/>
involves shared information and a lot of trust. <br/>
<br/>
Three of my four children have myspace accounts. First of all, myspace<br/>
allows you to set your profile to &quot;private&quot; which means that anyone<br/>
wanting to be added to your friends list has to know certain<br/>
information first. Secondly, nobody gets on your friends list without<br/>
your approval even if you DON&#39;T have it set to private!  <br/>
<br/>
When the parent is the child&#39;s partner, the child has a trusted adult<br/>
to run information past. Sierra calls me in occasionally and asks me<br/>
who certain people are before she adds them...usually it&#39;s some<br/>
unschooled child we met at a past conference. She chats regularly with<br/>
57 friends and loves it! She&#39;s learned to type pretty fast, has<br/>
learned a ton of spelling and enjoys her online social group immensely.<br/>
<br/>
She knows that some people lie about who they are. Even if someone DID<br/>
manage to convince her they were a 9year old friend when they weren&#39;t,<br/>
how on earth are they going to lure her away?? All my children know<br/>
that when you meet someone from the internet for the first time, you<br/>
make sure it is a public place etc...<br/>
<br/>
Most of our close friends are people we met online. If it were that<br/>
dangerous, we should have met at least ONE creepy person by now. We<br/>
haven&#39;t. Not one. That doesn&#39;t mean they aren&#39;t out there, doesn&#39;t<br/>
mean it won&#39;t happen, but I DO think that unschoolers raised<br/>
respectfully and with involved parents are pretty much immune to<br/>
getting cornered.<br/>
<br/>
ANYONE can get harrassed. Not just anyone can get cornered or lured<br/>
into a bad situation. NO matter how inexperienced a child is, why on<br/>
earth wouldn&#39;t they be telling their parents about someone they met<br/>
online that they want to meet in real life??? In a trusting<br/>
relationship, that is NOT an issue. <br/>
<br/>
All of my children would tell me if they met someone online and wanted<br/>
to meet up with that person. All of them know to be cautious until<br/>
they get to know someone. I have NO concerns about them being sneaky<br/>
(they have NO reason to be) because they don&#39;t get in trouble. Ever.<br/>
I don&#39;t punish any of them. EVER. Very different situation than what<br/>
most kids deal with.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a false sense of security. It&#39;s a true sense of security. And<br/>
not because I don&#39;t believe bad things can happen to anyone...I just<br/>
don&#39;t fear my child being lured away under false pretenses because<br/>
they&#39;d be TALKING to me before they met anyone!!!<br/>

&gt; appropriate?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>......<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Kids do not want to watch those programs .<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s more accurate to turn that around. Fears about these  <br/>
programs stem from fears that children (implying all) will watch  <br/>
violence and sex unless we stop them. *All* children don&#39;t want to  <br/>
watch violence and sex. But the opposite isn&#39;t true. It isn&#39;t  <br/>
accurate to say *all* children *don&#39;t* want to watch violence and sex.<br/>
<br/>
Though it might be accurate to say all children don&#39;t want to watch  <br/>
sex. In 11 years on line talking about this stuff, I&#39;ve only talked  <br/>
with one woman whose young son wanted to see sexual situations. My  <br/>
immediate thought would be sexual abuse but it sounded like (and it&#39;s  <br/>
obviously impossible to know) that wasn&#39;t the case. Barring that,  <br/>
talking further it wasn&#39;t totally clear that it wasn&#39;t something else  <br/>
he wanted to see. Maybe just naturally curious about sex and he got  <br/>
the idea that the only information about it was movies! Maybe just  <br/>
highly visual and needed to see the answers to his questions.<br/>
<br/>
In these conversations about protecting kids from sex and violence on  <br/>
TV it&#39;s common for a parent or two to pipe up and say &quot;Wait! My child  <br/>
loves horror movies even though they give him/her nightmares.&quot; (Or  <br/>
just loves horror movies period!) But it just doesn&#39;t happen that  <br/>
parents say &quot;Wait! My child loves sex scenes in movies. He/she fast  <br/>
forwards past all the talking to get to the sex.&quot;! Interest in sex  <br/>
stems from hormones. When the body is ready (or on its way to ready)  <br/>
to reproduce, the brain starts finding sex interesting. But 6 yos --  <br/>
barring some unusual biochemistry -- don&#39;t have the hormones and just  <br/>
aren&#39;t interested.<br/>
<br/>
Violence, on the other hand, is universally understandable -- though  <br/>
not universally enjoyable -- to everyone regardless of age. Violence  <br/>
has shaped our brains since time immemorial. Kill to eat. Crush  <br/>
rivals to get access to sex. Admire the ability to crush rivals since  <br/>
it indicates strong survivor genes. (Funny how it comes back to  <br/>
sex ;-) We&#39;ve just added layers on top of the ancient impulses that  <br/>
control when it&#39;s okay to be violent. The ancient desires, needs,  <br/>
attitudes are still there. They&#39;re just underneath other layers. So  <br/>
it&#39;s perfectly naturally to kids to understand and appreciate (some  <br/>
level) of violence.<br/>
<br/>
All kids are searching for programs they enjoy. *Most* kids are going  <br/>
to find adult movies and shows boring. There just isn&#39;t anything kid  <br/>
drawing about adults talking or kissing or having sex. As they flip  <br/>
through channels, there&#39;s nothing that will make them want to stop  <br/>
and watch. It&#39;s boring.<br/>
<br/>
All kids understand the level of violence and horror they&#39;re  <br/>
comfortable with. It&#39;s perfectly natural for kids to test their  <br/>
boundaries to see if they&#39;re able to handle what bothered them  <br/>
before. It&#39;s part of growing. Even adults test their boundaries. And  <br/>
it&#39;s really cool when we find something we can handle that we  <br/>
couldn&#39;t before.<br/>
<br/>
Kids are all along the spectrum when it comes to level of tolerance  <br/>
for violence. Some don&#39;t want to see any violence and are bothered by  <br/>
intense situations. Some will watch Texas Chainsaw Massacre at 5 and  <br/>
say &quot;MOM! It&#39;s just a movie! Sheeesh!&quot; ;-)<br/>
<br/>
So rather than standing between a child and TV and wondering how to  <br/>
protect them from it, it&#39;s better to stand beside a child and look in  <br/>
the direction they&#39;re facing and wonder together how to do what is  <br/>
interesting them in ways that will be comfortable for them. Because  <br/>
kids *do* want to be comfortable and safe. (Though some kids  <br/>
definitions of comfortable my be testing their boundaries on horror  <br/>
movies!) They don&#39;t want to be surprised by violence that&#39;s way  <br/>
beyond boundaries they aren&#39;t interested in testing yet. They don&#39;t  <br/>
want to stumble across some scene that captures their interest that  <br/>
turns into sex that confuses and scares them.<br/>
<br/>
So talk to them about what will help them see the things they want to  <br/>
see and avoid the things they don&#39;t want to see. Give them the tools  <br/>
to help themselves be comfortable and safe. (But don&#39;t hand the  <br/>
responsibility of being safe over to them. It&#39;s still our job to keep  <br/>
on helping them.)<br/>
<br/>
Help them find the channels they&#39;ll feel comfortable with if they&#39;re  <br/>
going to be up late and help them recognize the channels that might  <br/>
have things that will bother them. *Ask* the kids if they&#39;d like  <br/>
certain channels blocked so they don&#39;t even have to flip past them.<br/>
<br/>
Trust that they want to stay close to their comfort zone and talk  <br/>
together about ideas on how to do that. Trust that they *don&#39;t want  <br/>
to see* violence that&#39;s beyond the boundaries they aren&#39;t ready to  <br/>
test. Help them figure out how to stay in their comfort zone. Give  <br/>
them the tools that will help them do what they want (watch TV, surf  <br/>
the internet) and help them avoid the things they want to avoid.<br/>
<br/>
Even with all the tools, we can&#39;t, of course, protect them from ever  <br/>
seeing something they don&#39;t want to see. And when that happens, we  <br/>
can help them build up more tools on how to handle surprising  <br/>
situations and how to cope with the unexpected. Those are tools that  <br/>
can serve them for a lifetime. Protecting them prevents them from  <br/>
acquiring those tools.<br/>
<br/>
(And some kids do want to push hard on the boundaries of their  <br/>
comfort zones. They want horror movies even though they&#39;re scared.  <br/>
There are ways to help kids explore those boundaries. If we&#39;re their  <br/>
partner rather than their protector, they&#39;ll be more likely to reach  <br/>
out for help rather than pushing themselves too far in fear that  <br/>
controls will come down and they won&#39;t be able to see what fascinates/ <br/>
scares them.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is their no such thing as &quot;age appropriate?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Strictly speaking, no. There are movies I have no interest in  <br/>
watching! So there isn&#39;t an age when Saw is appropriate.<br/>
<br/>
Turn it around. Rather than dividing the world into things you will  <br/>
let him watch and things you want to protect him from, divide the  <br/>
world into things he is interested in and things he isn&#39;t interested  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>No one should assume their kids have experience or knowledge to keep  <br/>
themselves safe.<br/>
<br/>
But we should assume they all want to feel safe.<br/>
<br/>
So our job is to help them do what they want. We don&#39;t need to get  <br/>
into the subject of sexual predators with a 5 yo, but we can talk  <br/>
about bad people who sometimes pretend to be children so *sometimes*  <br/>
it isn&#39;t safe to give out personal information. (Stories are full of  <br/>
&quot;bad guys&quot; so that&#39;s a perfectly understandable concept to them.)<br/>
<br/>
But sometimes it is. And if they know that they can come to us when  <br/>
someone is asking for personal information (be it a person or a form)  <br/>
and we can help them figure out if it&#39;s safe or not, they will come  <br/>
and ask because they do want to be safe. They also want to do fun  <br/>
things. If we put keeping them in *our* comfort zone ahead of helping  <br/>
them do what they want, they&#39;ll find a way to do what they want  <br/>
without us knowing so we won&#39;t stop them.<br/>
<br/>
The thing is when we say &quot;Don&#39;t,&quot; or &quot;You&#39;re not allowed because it  <br/>
isn&#39;t safe,&quot; and they&#39;ve done it or their friends have done it and  <br/>
nothing has happened, we lose credibility. They then can&#39;t trust what  <br/>
we say. So the one obvious option is to sneak off and do it because  <br/>
we&#39;re so clueless as to not understand it well enough to know it&#39;s safe.<br/>
<br/>
But if they know we&#39;re trying to help them do what they want, they  <br/>
*will* help us help them do it safely. They want to talk to their  <br/>
friends on line. They *don&#39;t* want to be approached by some jerk  <br/>
pretending to be a child. If they suspect that if they come to us  <br/>
with something that makes them uncomfortable that we&#39;ll take away  <br/>
their access to  what they enjoy in order to keep them safe, they  <br/>
aren&#39;t going to come to us! They&#39;re going to try to muddle through on  <br/>
their own. If they know we&#39;re their partners in trying to help them  <br/>
do what they want, they *will* come to us for advice because they  <br/>
trust that we&#39;re trying to help.<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s useful to ask ourself if the action we want to take to keep  <br/>
them safe will encourage them to come to us with a problem. Or if it  <br/>
will make them keep quiet because they fear we&#39;ll stop them.<br/>

It just seems to me that the unschooling philosphy, or at least what I am hearing on this site,  says that if you subscribe to the adult channel, you should make it available. Why block it? There is nothing that is &quot;age-appropriate&quot; and it can be a source of discussion and learning. And kids wont want to watch it, correct? <br/>
For the record, both my teenagers have MySpace accounts and I do not limit their access to the internet. I have no parental controls and they can spend as much time online as they want and and they can watch TV for as long as they want. My dd 14/yo stays up until 3am on myspace and in chat rooms, and is now into webcam chatrooms, which she prefers, because &quot;at least you can see that people really are who they say they are. No one can pose as someone or something they are not.&quot; She has had the experience of being stalked on the internet by someone creepy. I think because she made the mistake of allowing someone into her &quot;friends&quot; on MySpace that she shouldnt have. My previous post was in no way a derogation of MySpace, just a warning that creepy people on the internet have ways of getting to kids. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s more helpful in understanding unschooling to see the  <br/>
goal as providing children access to what they want (or might be  <br/>
interested in) rather than giving them access to everything.<br/>
<br/>
If there were a 24 hour horror channel, I&#39;d block it for me so I  <br/>
didn&#39;t have to flip past those movies.<br/>
<br/>
*Usually* blocking means parents hold the key and won&#39;t let children  <br/>
have it. For unschoolers blocking can be a useful tool to help people  <br/>
in the family get what they want. We can give kids the code. We can  <br/>
unblock it when they ask.<br/>
<br/>
So blocking doesn&#39;t need to mean one thing. It depends what attitude  <br/>
it&#39;s being used with. If someone blocks channels with the attitude of  <br/>
&quot;No, you can&#39;t see that,&quot; of &quot;I don&#39;t want you to see that,&quot; then it  <br/>
creates forbidden fruit. On the other hand if someone is blocking  <br/>
something with the attitude of &quot;Let me move that out of the way so  <br/>
you don&#39;t have to look at it,&quot; then it&#39;s helping someone get what  <br/>
they want (freedom from having to see what they don&#39;t want to see.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There are such things as individual taste, though. Not everyone wants  <br/>
to see everything.<br/>
<br/>
The unschooling question is: What do your children want?<br/>
