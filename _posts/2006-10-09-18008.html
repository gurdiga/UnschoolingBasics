<div id="ygrps-yiv-89991474">Hello List,<br/>
<br/>
what is the difference between Unschooling and Antiauthoritarian?<br/>
<br/>
I know it is different, but have you ever heard people say  <br/>
Unschooling doesn&#39;t work because it&#39;s the same as the  <br/>
antiauthoritarian approach and that &quot;didn&#39;t work&quot;? What did you say?  <br/>
I guess I&#39;m not quite sure, what the antiauthoritarian approach  <br/>
actually covered. My parents used to say they were &quot;quite  <br/>
antiauthoritarian&quot;, but I feel they kinda weren&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Unschooling works because parents are quite mindful.  And one would<br/>
have to question whether antiauthoritarian (or better thought would be<br/>
non-coercive) parenting &quot;doesn&#39;t work.&quot;  I&#39;ve seen some great results<br/>
from being &quot;non-authoritarian.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I found a quote: &quot;Gone are the times of the antiauthoritarian  <br/>
theories of the 1970s when children could find out for themselves  <br/>
what was good or bad for them; some enjoyed this, some didn´t and  <br/>
envied their mates who were told what to do and what not.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Which pretty much sums it up.<br/>
<br/>
So antiauthoritarian would be letting the kids figure it out for  <br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling parents do let kids figure things out when they want to  <br/>
but are there to help them when they want help.<br/>
<br/>
The unschooling philosophy isn&#39;t focused so much on an ideal -- let  <br/>
them figure it out -- but on meeting the kids&#39; needs. We walk along  <br/>
beside them being there when they need us there and backing off when  <br/>
they need us to back off. Some kids need more backing off to figure  <br/>
it out for themselves, which would look like antiauthoritarian  <br/>
parenting. But some kids need more help or like being with someone as  <br/>
they explore to talk about it and antiauthoritarian wouldn&#39;t meet  <br/>
their needs at all.<br/>
<br/>
I think most parenting theories would claim to meet kids&#39; needs. But  <br/>
with most the parents feel they know what&#39;s best and decide what the  <br/>
kids&#39; needs are. Unschoolers treat each child as an individual and  <br/>
trust children&#39;s feelings about themselves. If they act as if they  <br/>
want more of our time we need to trust their actions rather than  <br/>
referring to some authority to tell us how much of our time our kids  <br/>
should need.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s something missing from that explanation, though, because it  <br/>
causes parents to think we mean stay up until 2AM with a 3 yo because  <br/>
they don&#39;t lay down to sleep earlier and I&#39;m not quite sure how to  <br/>
get that concept in neatly without tacking it on like this. ;-)<br/>
