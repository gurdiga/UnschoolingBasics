Wonderful book that says the most important things you can do for/with<br/>
your birth to 5 child is 1. talk to them 2. read to them. 3. Let them<br/>
play and play with them.<br/>
<br/>
What I liked about the book is it was filled with LOTS of scientific<br/>
research to back up all its statements and examples of really<br/>
interesting studies on how children learn. It is well written and easy<br/>
to read.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to find a similar book for grade school and even high school<br/>
learning. Does anyone know of such books?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-279971732">Scott Noelle&#39;s Daily Groove is amazing for those of you that don&#39;t yet subscribe.  I have to copy my favourite one yet:<br/>
   <br/>
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
   <br/>
  Mother Nature doesn&#39;t aim for mediocre. She imbues<br/>
  every child with HUGE creative potential.<br/>
   <br/>
  Children are born *knowing* they&#39;re supposed to be<br/>
  BIG -- innately powerful, free, and continuously<br/>
  expanding to new horizons.<br/>
   <br/>
  Today, no matter how physically small your child<br/>
  may be, notice and appreciate his or her BIGness in<br/>
  spirit. That spirit is easy to see when your child<br/>
  is expressing pure Love and Joy. But it&#39;s no less<br/>
  present when s/he&#39;s &quot;misbehaving.&quot; In those trying<br/>
  times, remember...<br/>
   <br/>
     Our children are always doing the best they<br/>
     can to stay connected to their BIGness --<br/>
     in a world that expects them to be small.<br/>
   <br/>
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
   <br/>
  So beautiful.  I can&#39;t help but think what a different world we would be living in if ALL children were regarded this way.<br/>
   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1683218499">The Einstein book has several examples of children that go to academic<br/>
preschools versus kids who go to play based preschools. By<br/>
kindergarten, the only differences are that the academically trained<br/>
kids have more anxiety and are not as creative.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re concerned that your child has actual delays (my son had a<br/>
speech delay that we picked up at 8 months,) you can do a ages and<br/>
stages questionnaire. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://asq.uoregon.edu/">http://asq.uoregon.edu/</a> It only takes a couple<br/>
minutes, is free, and uses the standard milestones for your child&#39;s age.<br/>
<br/>
We will unschool as well. Our son is 28 months. I am so excited to be<br/>
going down this path. I think you&#39;ll love the Einstein book.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1464200526">There are milestones that are indicative of children with delays.<br/>
Because the earlier interventions occur, the easier the delays are to<br/>
treat, we opted to start therapy as soon as we found the delay.<br/>
Therapy consisted of a speech therapist coming to our house and<br/>
showing me different ways to play that taught him the &quot;language&quot;<br/>
skills he needed. Early intervention is free, is play based, and is<br/>
very effective, especially when started as early as possible. There is<br/>
no reason NOT to intervene. Maybe a delay is just a different<br/>
development rate that each child has, but maybe it&#39;s something bigger.<br/>
Also, when a child is considered delayed, what they are doing is<br/>
significantly behind the majority of children. Not only was he not<br/>
making the sounds he should have been, he&#39;d also stopped making<br/>
sounds, like &quot;o&quot; that he&#39;d been making before. Regression is a scary<br/>
thing.<br/>
<br/>
So, we&#39;re now at 28 months and all is well. He is using 5 to 8 word<br/>
sentences. Perhaps he would have gotten here without therapy, but as I<br/>
said, it was free and play based, so there was no reason to not do it.<br/>

  Wow, how did you ever pick up a speech &quot;delay&quot; at EIGHT months???  I&#39;m really curious about that!  My twin girls didn&#39;t say much until after they were 2, and I never thought to even consider that they might be &quot;delayed&quot;, I just always knew they were on *their own* track.<br/>
   <br/>
  So to me this is really dangerous thinking for our kids!  Delayed according to what, according to whom??  How on earth can an average eight month old baby be behind???<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; very effective, especially when started as early as possible. There<br/>

<br/>
I disagree.<br/>
I believe that most &quot;therapy&quot; is less effective than parents being<br/>
connected and interacting with their child. ESPECIALLY at such a young<br/>
age.<br/>
<br/>
My youngest did not speak more than some grunts and garbled words<br/>
until he was close to three years of age. You wouldn&#39;t be able to tell<br/>
him apart from the average seven year old today. No therapy, no<br/>
intervention. I think unschooling will blossom best in an atmosphere<br/>
of trust and labeling children as &quot;delayed&quot; is NOT going to help that<br/>
at all.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~ Also, when a child is considered delayed, what they are doing is<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; significantly behind the majority of children. ~~<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And why would that matter? I don&#39;t compare my children to other<br/>
children. They are each developing in their own way and time.<br/>
<br/>
~~ Perhaps he would have gotten here without therapy, but as I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; said, it was free and play based, so there was no reason to not do it.~~<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It doesn&#39;t help parents trust. It makes them think their children<br/>
won&#39;t be ok without therapy and intervention. It labels a child as<br/>
&quot;delayed&quot; when they&#39;re simply unfolding in their own way and time. And<br/>
yes, &quot;regression&quot; is normal and natural. Even with things like peeing<br/>
in a toilet and other developmental skills.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If the &quot;therapy&quot; is just play,then parents can do that just fine<br/>
without being fearful or deciding their child is delayed. Unschooling<br/>
needs trust to work out well. Trust in each individual&#39;s ability and<br/>
time table especially. If you can&#39;t trust an eight month old to<br/>
develop language later than some other children, how can you trust a 9<br/>
or 10 or 13 year old to read in their own time?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1646432841">So, I can see the point of not labeling a child, especially if it is <br/>

<br/>
Absolutely.<br/>
A lot of us have learned many new ways of interacting with our<br/>
children and better supporting their needs. That has nothing to do<br/>
with comparing a child&#39;s ability to other children. There are reasons<br/>
to be concerned but a non-talking 8 month old is not one of them in my<br/>
book.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~I think that the unschooling groups and parents I&#39;ve spoken to have <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; had some cool ideas about how I can better interact with my son and <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m SOOOO glad I haven&#39;t stayed away from this &quot;therapy.&quot;~~<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Learning from each other, utilizing resources to better support our<br/>
families and understand each other are great things to do! I have no<br/>
issue with people figuring out how to nourish their child whether that<br/>
child seems &quot;delayed&quot; or not.<br/>
<br/>
I researched the heck out of sensory integration disorder and many<br/>
other traits in order to understand what might help or hinder Jalen. I<br/>
chose to never see and of it as a &quot;disorder&quot; (ick) or &quot;delay&quot; because<br/>
that is saying the person is somehow &quot;less than&quot; rather than<br/>
THEMSELVES. There are times we need a diagnoses. I have met Melissa&#39;s<br/>
children and there is no way I would say she should avoid a diagnoses<br/>
when severe autism is present!<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes a thing is beyond our scope of capability. Nothing wrong<br/>
with gaining some help or understanding.<br/>
<br/>
I still don&#39;t see how a non-speaking (or even regressing) BABY needs<br/>
any kind of &quot;therapy&quot; or diagnoses for language. Again, if unschooling<br/>
is to work long-term for a family, I think there needs to be a HUGE<br/>
amount of trust in each individual&#39;s time table. There also needs to<br/>
be a HUGE amount of trust that a loving, nurturing and aware family<br/>
can provide what the child needs, even if utilizing outside resources.<br/>
<br/>
If the first course of action for a non-speaking 8 month old is<br/>
diagnoses, &quot;delayed&quot; labels and therapy, what is that family going to<br/>
do when faced with other comparisons at a much older age?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-446978512">I had replied to the prior poster, but the reply never came through. <br/>
<br/>
There are many developmental delays that can become more and more<br/>
serious as children get older. Every child has a different schedule,<br/>
but some schedules are problematic. Some schedules indicate serious<br/>
problems. I am a proactive parent and I educate myself on the<br/>
difference. I have worked with developmentally delayed children and I<br/>
have seen the full spectrum of parental involvement. I have seen<br/>
parents whose lack of involvement meant the child would not get the<br/>
help they need and they would have lifelong problems.<br/>
<br/>
I see unschooling like a grocery store. Some parents would say, &quot;Eat<br/>
what you want.&quot; That is their style. I do not want my child to eat<br/>
Twinkies, so I say, &quot;You can eat anything in the produce department.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I want my children to trust in me. I want them to know I am proactive<br/>
in helping them. Sometimes that means I sit back and let them figure<br/>
it out on their own. Sometimes that means I take a more proactive<br/>
approach. The needs of the child and my knowledge will help me choose<br/>
where on the spectrum I need to be at any given time.<br/>
<br/>
If my children were 12 years old and having difficulty reading, they<br/>
would know that I would be doing as much as possible to help them<br/>
overcome their difficulties.<br/>
<br/>
I would love to have a discussion about this that is not judgmental or<br/>
close-minded.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-699147578">~~ Every child has a different schedule,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but some schedules are problematic. Some schedules indicate serious<br/>
&gt; problems.~~<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How are different &quot;schedules&quot; problematic in an unschooling family?<br/>
Why would it matter if a child spoke &quot;early&quot; or &quot;later&quot;...same with<br/>
reading, same with everything.<br/>
<br/>
~~ I have seen<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; parents whose lack of involvement meant the child would not get the<br/>
&gt; help they need and they would have lifelong problems.~~<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not advocating a lack of involvement, I&#39;m advocating a lack of<br/>
labeling developmental differences and bringing in &quot;experts&quot; at the<br/>
drop of a hat.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~I see unschooling like a grocery store. Some parents would say, &quot;Eat<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; what you want.&quot; That is their style. I do not want my child to eat<br/>
&gt; Twinkies, so I say, &quot;You can eat anything in the produce department.&quot;~~<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So what happens when they are beyond your control (and believe me it<br/>
happens faster than you would believe)and they want a twinkie?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~I want them to know I am proactive<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; in helping them.~~<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Help doesn&#39;t involve deciding what and when other people need to learn<br/>
something. <br/>
<br/>
~~Sometimes that means I sit back and let them figure<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; it out on their own. Sometimes that means I take a more proactive<br/>
&gt; approach. The needs of the child and my knowledge will help me<br/>
 </span></blockquote>choose where on the spectrum I need to be at any given time.~~<br/>
<br/>
I would venture to guess that every parent here feels the same way.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~If my children were 12 years old and having difficulty reading, they<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; would know that I would be doing as much as possible to help them<br/>
&gt; overcome their difficulties.~~<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But you&#39;re still seeing it as a &quot;difficulty&quot;. My child learned to read<br/>
at the age of 12 with zero difficulties because we never labeled him<br/>
as &quot;delayed&quot; nor did we push him to learn anything before he needed it<br/>
and was developmentally ready. People will learn without being taught.<br/>
Seeing a child that is learning certain skills later than some of<br/>
their peers and viewing it as a &quot;difficulty&quot; will hinder unschooling<br/>
trust.<br/>
<br/>
~~I would love to have a discussion about this that is not judgmental<br/>
or close-minded.~~<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re pretty open minded here. Problem is, most of us have full<br/>
awareness of mainstream views. Several here have teaching backgrounds<br/>
and know all about child development. I&#39;m pretty aware of Piaget and<br/>
other information out there as my Mum was a teacher herself.  So there<br/>
isn&#39;t much about developmental &quot;delays&quot; I&#39;m not already aware<br/>
of....very few people out there will discuss avoiding these labels and<br/>
finding a totally different lifestyle where children are trusted.<br/>
<br/>
This list is that place.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that my judgment of your choice can be seen as just that.If I<br/>
were to place judgement on you as a human being I know very little<br/>
about, it would be that you are a very involved, caring and loving parent.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean I will agree that therapy for an eight month old is<br/>
necessary or money well-spent.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1701787240">I have been unwell of late and haven&#39;t followed this thread from the<br/>
beginning, but I&#39;ve read enough to want to post this.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter Morgan is almost 4 yrs old.  She was adopted from China<br/>
and we brought her home in January.  She had neither English nor<br/>
Chinese language.  The SWI called her &quot;sweet and quiet but very<br/>
disobedient&quot;  They told us when they brought her to us that she could<br/>
not feed herself nor was she potty trained.  They did not admit she<br/>
had no language...they told us she &quot;would refuse to listen&quot;.  (Now<br/>
keep in mind this is translated so it sounds harsh but much could have<br/>
been lost in the translation.)<br/>
<br/>
But here&#39;s the deal...Morgan has some 2 dozen words now but<br/>
understands much more.  I can say &quot;Go put this in the trash&quot; and she<br/>
can do that but she can&#39;t/won&#39;t say &quot;trash&quot; nor will she point to the<br/>
trash can if I ask her where it is.  (Which I have done only to gauge<br/>
the depth of her understanding.)  Anyway, everyone that knows us,<br/>
knows that Morgan was labelled as having autism and everyone is<br/>
pushing us to get her evaluated *RIGHT NOW* before....(insert here a<br/>
list of tragedies if it&#39;s not done now)...we have chosen to do<br/>
nothing.  The five of us do just fine.  Morgan gets fed, makes her<br/>
wants and needs understood and gets them met.  She uses the words she<br/>
thinks are most important like &quot;more&quot;...she saw the need to use a word<br/>
to get what she wanted and she uses it.  If she can say &quot;more&quot; she<br/>
COULD say other things.  Is she refusing?  Don&#39;t know...but I don&#39;t<br/>
care, I shamelessly steal the words of Mrs Turtle on the cartoon<br/>
Franklin and use them for myself when I say &quot;Morgan will talk when<br/>
she&#39;s ready and not before.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Does this mean she will be 17 and still not speaking?  I suppose so,<br/>
but if that&#39;s the case, we&#39;ll figure it out.  People have advised<br/>
teaching her signing, and the use of graphic pictures etc so she can<br/>
make her needs known but she refuses/can&#39;t/declines to use them.<br/>
She&#39;d rather we do what we do now.  It&#39;s comfortable for her.  I could<br/>
*make* her I guess, by putting her on the NFF (Nothing is For Free)<br/>
program, which I&#39;ve been prompted to do by several &quot;specialists&quot;<br/>
giving me unsolicited advice.  That would be say dangling her sippee<br/>
over her head and not giving it to her until she makes the attempt at<br/>
speaking.  I choose not to do that.<br/>
<br/>
To the OP, your 8 month old child might have issues, I didn&#39;t see the<br/>
original post.  But if your child can suck, swallow, stick her/his<br/>
tongue out etc...then you know all the muscles work.  If your baby can<br/>
cry you know the voice box works.  If your baby turns toward you or<br/>
noises then you know the ears work.  I gently suggest that you rejoice<br/>
in these things and not worry so much about not having language.  Your<br/>
baby will talk when she&#39;s ready and not before.  Personally I would<br/>
seek help if the child can&#39;t swallow or other such physical issues.<br/>
But if the body works, then give the baby room to be her.  She might<br/>
be an active listener with nothing much to say.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I see it as less an issue of trust as has been suggested by<br/>
others and more of an issue of acceptance of your child as she was<br/>
made and chooses to be.  I know it&#39;s scary.  I sometimes look at<br/>
Morgan and wonder if by not getting her seen and forcing all kinds of<br/>
reparitive therapies on her if I&#39;m dooming her to a life of &quot;less<br/>
than&quot; but then I take a deep breath and remind myself that Morgan IS.<br/>
She is potential but it&#39;s her potential...not mine.  And she&#39;s a happy<br/>
kid.  If your baby seems pretty happy I&#39;d let it go.  I had a<br/>
precocious talker who was using full sentences by age 12 months.  My<br/>
second child was much less chatty.  And now my third talks when she<br/>
wants and says what she needs to say.  (Don&#39;t DO DAT!!)  I don&#39;t need<br/>
her to be able to tell me stories to think she&#39;s OK.  She&#39;s pretty<br/>
darn terrific just as she is.<br/>

The question is more in terms of *how*. From an unschooling <br/>
standpoint, being proactive in ways that build trust and foster <br/>
connections is really important. Calling on an &quot;expert&quot; early on <br/>
doesn&#39;t build trust or foster connections between a parent and <br/>
child. It doesn&#39;t lead a parent to trust her own judgement more or <br/>
work on connecting with her child more. At best, it builds trust in <br/>
and fosters connections with a stranger. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not to say that calling on trained professionals is never an <br/>
option for unschoolers! Its not a great place to start, though.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Its reasonable to assume that radical unschoolers will be more on <br/>
the &quot;involved&quot; end of the spectrum, sort of by definition ;) Perhaps <br/>
you could offer some links to online resources for any parents who <br/>
are concerned about this issue so that they can do some more <br/>
research for themselves? <br/>

<br/>
Nothing is snowballing. Truly.<br/>
It&#39;s a discussion list. If you post things that aren&#39;t helpful to<br/>
unschooling then it will get a lot of attention and discussion, that&#39;s<br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>
There are going to be certain topics that will garner more interest<br/>
and more posts. It&#39;s not about the person posting them, it&#39;s about the<br/>
ideas presented. We tend to discuss some things in depth and question<br/>
certain ideas pretty intensely.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re comfortable with that kind of discussion you&#39;ll be fine. If<br/>
not, I suggest reading for a while to get a &quot;feel&quot; for the list and<br/>
the tone in order to decide if it will be a useful resource.<br/>
<br/>
Topics that tend to get discussed heavily are food restrictions on<br/>
kids, chores, the idea of &quot;experts&quot;/therapy and punishments/rewards.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Help doesn&#39;t involve deciding what and when other people need to learn<br/>
 </span></blockquote>something.&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I disagree. As a parent, when a child that doesn&#39;t know better wants<br/>
something that I know will be harmful to them, I think that is a terrific<br/>
time for them to learn about moderation, and discernment, and that not all<br/>
foods/activities/etc in our big happy world are created equal.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that&#39;s the point the original poster was trying to make. Yes it&#39;s<br/>
great to be positive and enthusiastic about the produce and the cheese and<br/>
the different kinds of bread. And no, I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s necessary for a<br/>
good unschooler to say &quot;yes&quot; unquestioningly to EVERYTHING the child<br/>
suddenly wants. You can be an unschooler that presents the aspects of those<br/>
choices that the child may not have thought about, deciding for them not<br/>
when they&#39;ll learn it, but when they&#39;ll be exposed to a valuable fact or<br/>
opinion that they might not have otherwise been exposed to. Something as<br/>
simple as a true story: &quot;I once ate X Twinkies and then threw up, didn&#39;t<br/>
want to see one or smell one for months!&quot; That&#39;s something a child will<br/>
decide what to do with in their mind. Whether they&#39;ll still want to try it,<br/>
or whether to learn vicariously from someone else&#39;s experience. That is<br/>
their choice. The choice to expose the kid to that idea, and when, is the<br/>
parent&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
So back to the 8 month old. If the parent decided that the play therapy was<br/>
a positive thing for the reasons she explained, I don&#39;t see how it&#39;s<br/>
&quot;against unschooling&quot; for her to have done so.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Nothing is snowballing. Truly.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s a discussion list. If you post things that aren&#39;t helpful to<br/>
&gt; unschooling then it will get a lot of attention and discussion, that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are going to be certain topics that will garner more interest<br/>
&gt; and more posts. It&#39;s not about the person posting them, it&#39;s about the<br/>
&gt; ideas presented. We tend to discuss some things in depth and question<br/>
&gt; certain ideas pretty intensely.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you&#39;re comfortable with that kind of discussion you&#39;ll be fine. If<br/>
&gt; not, I suggest reading for a while to get a &quot;feel&quot; for the list and<br/>
&gt; the tone in order to decide if it will be a useful resource.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Topics that tend to get discussed heavily are food restrictions on<br/>
&gt; kids, chores, the idea of &quot;experts&quot;/therapy and punishments/rewards.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; thing.<br/>

wanted to wear diapers again. My husband started to get freaked <br/>
about it. Why would a 4yo who&#39;s been using the toilet for about 8 <br/>
months all of a sudden want to wear a diaper again? I asked him if <br/>
he&#39;d ever heard of regression. It&#39;s quite normal for short periods <br/>
of time at any age and nothing to be concerned about. My ds wore a <br/>
diaper for a couple of hours one day. <br/>
<br/>
An 8 month old is barely verbalizing. I can&#39;t imagine how a speech <br/>
delay could be noticed at that time. My 10 month old makes various <br/>
noises and then stops for periods of time. Then he will start up <br/>
again and maybe make new noises. It&#39;s all normal.<br/>

So, what harm are you talking about? Real life examples are more  <br/>

at teachable moments. Too often &quot;teachable moments&quot; is a parent  <br/>
internally saying &quot;You&#39;re wrong. I&#39;m right. I need you to see the  <br/>
right way.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If my daughter comes for a second bowl of ice cream she&#39;d appreciate  <br/>
me saying &quot;We&#39;re eating in 15 minutes.&quot; Then she can use the  <br/>
information to make a more informed choice. As part of her decision  <br/>
making, she might ask what we&#39;re having. :-) The right answer is  <br/>
whatever she decides, not what I think she should do. Part of living  <br/>
together, she will have gathered the nutritional value of food but  <br/>
even if she decides she&#39;d rather have more ice cream than dinner,  <br/>
it&#39;s not a forever decision where this one experience will kill her  <br/>
or where forever after she&#39;ll decide to have ice cream instead of  <br/>
dinner. She can use the freedom and experience to assess when it&#39;s  <br/>
right for *her* to have something other than dinner.<br/>
<br/>
We learn best with the freedom to explore. Part of that freedom is  <br/>
trying things out to see what happens *to us*. Part of that freedom  <br/>
is the freedom to put up with the bad parts of something for a while  <br/>
to get the good parts.<br/>
<br/>
If  child is unhappy and feels stuck in a place better than saying no  <br/>
to what they&#39;re doing is to expand their world so there is more to  <br/>
choose from. Help them find something else rather than make them do  <br/>
something else.<br/>
<br/>
But, again, without a specific example, that&#39;s only vaguely helpful.<br/>

without controlling them, not for advice on how to limit them. Yes,  <br/>
it can be a lot more work to find ways to safely help kids explore  <br/>
the world than to just say no! We often have to pull our fears out  <br/>
and scrutinize them. That&#39;s uncomfortable work for many people. It&#39;s  <br/>
*much* easier to go with the fear and do something &quot;just incase&quot;. But  <br/>
this list isn&#39;t for promoting ideas to mollify fears. It&#39;s for  <br/>
dragging fears out kicking and screaming into the light of day ;-)<br/>
<br/>
My daughter at 16 had a Twinkie recently given by a friend and she  <br/>
said they sampled it and discussed it and tore it apart. It was her  <br/>
first Twinkie. (She&#39;s known about them for years since they&#39;re part  <br/>
of our culture.) I never bought Twinkies since I don&#39;t like them, but  <br/>
I also never pointed to them and said &quot;You can have anything but  <br/>
that.&quot; I could bet good money she would have been begging to have  <br/>
some! And the more I said no, the stronger the desire.<br/>
<br/>
Part of her growing up has been talking about food as we cook, as we  <br/>
eat, as we look for packages that don&#39;t have unpronounceable words on  <br/>
them ;-) It&#39;s general conversation about food, not unsolicited  <br/>
information given when she&#39;s asked, &quot;Can we try that?&quot; (Though she&#39;d  <br/>
appreciate me giving useful information she may not have noticed like  <br/>
&quot;That one&#39;s licorice flavor. The other is mango that you might like  <br/>
better.&quot; Or, &quot;There&#39;s a smaller package incase you don&#39;t like them.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
As an unrelated example, it was *much* more effective to discuss how  <br/>
advertisers use ploys to get us to want to try their product on ads  <br/>
for things she didn&#39;t want, toys that didn&#39;t interest her or adult  <br/>
products. WIthout the agenda they were interesting observations and  <br/>
discussions rather than a disguised way of saying &quot;I don&#39;t want you  <br/>
to have that and I need to persuade you to my way of thinking because  <br/>
yours is wrong.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree with what Alysia wrote here and know it for a fact.  I used to<br/>
work in the Special Needs classrooms.  Around the time I began to become<br/>
very disenchanted with the system was when one of the mums decided that<br/>
she would like here son to try attending a mainstream Grade 2 class in<br/>
hopes that his behaviour issues would lessen.  I had to sit at a meeting<br/>
with teachers and an administration personel as they all agreed that<br/>
they would not let this student go mainstream.  We all knew that if our<br/>
Special Needs class-size dropped to below ten students, we would be<br/>
affected funding-wise.  The mother&#39;s request to move her son was denied.<br/>
The mother ended up taking this to the top and eventually (this makes me<br/>
cringe...) won the right to move her son to mainstream.<br/>
<br/>
After my experience with the schools and students with Special Needs I<br/>
knew to never let my son near that system.  I&#39;m pretty sure that if my<br/>
son entered the system, a label would be put on him.  It would probably<br/>
be some form of sensory integration problem.  Something that I see his<br/>
body working out year after year to the point now where he seems<br/>
&quot;normal&quot;.  Now he&#39;s free to learn, live and love with every confidence<br/>
that he is whole and wonderfully made.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1327378746">Joyce,<br/>
I appreciate your statements about protecting children, and about a single<br/>
experience not being &quot;deadly&quot; to anyone, and especially about using specific<br/>
examples rather than vague ones.<br/>
So maybe the difference in where I&#39;m coming from is my experience with<br/>
children who had not only not been unschooled from birth, but who had been<br/>
through VERY different parenting before coming to me as foster children. Had<br/>
I been able to unschool them right away (I obviously wasn&#39;t, since the state<br/>
legally had custody, they even had to attend public school, and my hands<br/>
were clearly tied  by the agency as to what would have been considered<br/>
appropriate parenting regarding many issues) I *may* have been able to take<br/>
the absolutely scary but infinitely freeing plunge of providing them with<br/>
everything they hadn&#39;t been provided in terms of safety and guidance, while<br/>
at the same time supporting them making their own decisions on everything<br/>
from eating to how to spend their time to every other decision in their<br/>
lives. Clearly I didn&#39;t have that choice, so my goal was to get there very<br/>
very gradually instead. But in the course of doing that, and in hindsight, I<br/>
came doubt that  the &quot;radical&quot; approach that you and others on this board<br/>
advocate would have been in their best interest. In fact, I came to<br/>
understand and believe that a gradual approach to independence and freedom<br/>
as the child gets older and learns things, COULD be the most sensible<br/>
option, if not for &quot;all&quot; children (because I don&#39;t tend to make<br/>
pronouncements like that) at least for &quot;my&quot; children and possibly for some<br/>
others. After all, many children develop negative habits on their own, for<br/>
whatever set of circumstances, including simply the parents not having<br/>
discovered unschooling from the start. And that brings me to my point about<br/>
habits. I do believe there is such things as unhealthy habits, and healthy<br/>
ones - do you? And I also believe that we as humans can be creatures of<br/>
habit and that once those behavioral patterns are established, it takes more<br/>
than freedom and information to change them, otherwise why would it be so<br/>
hard for millions of well-informed, clearly free adults to quit smoking,<br/>
overeating, depriving themselves of sleep, and so many other<br/>
self-destructive behaviors that plague our society? To oversimplify (and I<br/>
do realize it&#39;s more complex than that, but bear with me) I believe this is<br/>
because established habits die hard. So, back to parenting, directly related<br/>
to protecting my child from harm, besides the short-term &quot;who&#39;s going to die<br/>
from this?&quot; question, which I agree with you is useful, I believe another<br/>
useful question to ask on a regular basis is &quot;what sort of habits do I want<br/>
them to form?&quot; because children have the luxury of being at a stage where<br/>
habits  in many areas of their lives are just being formed for the same<br/>
time. See, I&#39;m NOT saying that a child that grew up eating boxed macaroni<br/>
and cheese to the exclusion of anything else (in one case) or scavenging<br/>
from the trash or shop-lifting groceries to survive (in another) will not be<br/>
able to outgrow those behaviors (now we&#39;re getting to those specific<br/>
examples you were asking for), but I do believe that children need the<br/>
guidance of a parent to lead them away from those negative habits, and<br/>
leading them away sometimes might take a bit more than just providing<br/>
alternatives. Yes, mine are extreme cases, but I point them out because I&#39;ve<br/>
heard some people on this and another board say &quot;that just doesn&#39;t happen&quot;<br/>
in real life, when I actually have seen specific kids in not even as extreme<br/>
cases as mine, but simply in permissive parenting situations (not from<br/>
unschoolers at all, on the contrary, permissive in the sense that were<br/>
bordering on neglect) developing what I consider to be very unhealthy habits<br/>
in terms of their basic physical needs. I&#39;ve seen kids become obese at a<br/>
young age clearly not because of some genetic problem but due to the<br/>
availability of highly processed high calory foods in the house and nothing<br/>
else, combined with the availability of sedentary activity and nothing else.<br/>
This is a pet peeve of mine probably because, while my temperament was such<br/>
at a young age that I probably would have been much happier to munch away on<br/>
high-carb foods while reading book after book on the couch, I did get<br/>
enticed/pushed/encouraged by my parents towards some sort of physical<br/>
activity (which is probably why we went camping every summer even though my<br/>
mom wasn&#39;t keen on it) and why there were definitely rules about mealtimes<br/>
and limits on snacks, etc. I have seen the argument about that kind of<br/>
&quot;infringement on a child&#39;s freedom&quot; actually causing problems later in life,<br/>
and speaking of theory vs. specifics, I can agree with it in theory...but<br/>
what I see in my own life is the opposite: When I think of how hard my<br/>
parents worked on trying to teach me healthy habits, to me as an adult that<br/>
is more of a motivator, not less, to try and lead a healthy life. Is there<br/>
anyone out there not with me on this? Are there no adults on this board who<br/>
can say they &quot;turned out alright&quot; in some area of their lives, not in spite<br/>
of the way they were parented (if they were parented with SOME degree of<br/>
rules, as most of my generation were) but because of it?<br/>
Again, I do believe in unschooling principles and I&#39;m definitely not<br/>
advocating excessive and uncalled for regulation of a child life. I&#39;m<br/>
playing devil&#39;s advocate so to speak, only when I see &quot;all or nothing&quot;<br/>
reasoning about parenting (vs proactive, careful, balanced reasoning),<br/>
which just makes me shrug in an &quot;oh my, the pendulum doeth swing&quot; kind of<br/>
way -kwim?<br/>

&gt; I appreciate your statements about protecting children, and about a single<br/>
&gt; experience not being &quot;deadly&quot; to anyone, and especially about using specific<br/>
&gt; examples rather than vague ones.<br/>
&gt; So maybe the difference in where I&#39;m coming from is my experience with<br/>
&gt; children who had not only not been unschooled from birth, but who had been<br/>
&gt; through VERY different parenting before coming to me as foster children. Had<br/>
&gt; I been able to unschool them right away (I obviously wasn&#39;t, since the state<br/>
&gt; legally had custody, they even had to attend public school, and my hands<br/>
&gt; were clearly tied  by the agency as to what would have been considered<br/>
&gt; appropriate parenting regarding many issues) I *may* have been able to take<br/>
&gt; the absolutely scary but infinitely freeing plunge of providing them with<br/>
&gt; everything they hadn&#39;t been provided in terms of safety and guidance, while<br/>
&gt; at the same time supporting them making their own decisions on everything<br/>
&gt; from eating to how to spend their time to every other decision in their<br/>
&gt; lives. Clearly I didn&#39;t have that choice, so my goal was to get there very<br/>
&gt; very gradually instead. But in the course of doing that, and in hindsight, I<br/>
&gt; came doubt that  the &quot;radical&quot; approach that you and others on this board<br/>
&gt; advocate would have been in their best interest. In fact, I came to<br/>
&gt; understand and believe that a gradual approach to independence and freedom<br/>
&gt; as the child gets older and learns things, COULD be the most sensible<br/>
&gt; option, if not for &quot;all&quot; children (because I don&#39;t tend to make<br/>
&gt; pronouncements like that) at least for &quot;my&quot; children and possibly for some<br/>
&gt; others. After all, many children develop negative habits on their own, for<br/>
&gt; whatever set of circumstances, including simply the parents not having<br/>
&gt; discovered unschooling from the start. And that brings me to my point about<br/>
&gt; habits. I do believe there is such things as unhealthy habits, and healthy<br/>
&gt; ones - do you? And I also believe that we as humans can be creatures of<br/>
&gt; habit and that once those behavioral patterns are established, it takes more<br/>
&gt; than freedom and information to change them, otherwise why would it be so<br/>
&gt; hard for millions of well-informed, clearly free adults to quit smoking,<br/>
&gt; overeating, depriving themselves of sleep, and so many other<br/>
&gt; self-destructive behaviors that plague our society? To oversimplify (and I<br/>
&gt; do realize it&#39;s more complex than that, but bear with me) I believe this is<br/>
&gt; because established habits die hard. So, back to parenting, directly related<br/>
&gt; to protecting my child from harm, besides the short-term &quot;who&#39;s going to die<br/>
&gt; from this?&quot; question, which I agree with you is useful, I believe another<br/>
&gt; useful question to ask on a regular basis is &quot;what sort of habits do I want<br/>
&gt; them to form?&quot; because children have the luxury of being at a stage where<br/>
&gt; habits  in many areas of their lives are just being formed for the same<br/>
&gt; time. See, I&#39;m NOT saying that a child that grew up eating boxed macaroni<br/>
&gt; and cheese to the exclusion of anything else (in one case) or scavenging<br/>
&gt; from the trash or shop-lifting groceries to survive (in another) will not be<br/>
&gt; able to outgrow those behaviors (now we&#39;re getting to those specific<br/>
&gt; examples you were asking for), but I do believe that children need the<br/>
&gt; guidance of a parent to lead them away from those negative habits, and<br/>
&gt; leading them away sometimes might take a bit more than just providing<br/>
&gt; alternatives. Yes, mine are extreme cases, but I point them out because I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; heard some people on this and another board say &quot;that just doesn&#39;t happen&quot;<br/>
&gt; in real life, when I actually have seen specific kids in not even as extreme<br/>
&gt; cases as mine, but simply in permissive parenting situations (not from<br/>
&gt; unschoolers at all, on the contrary, permissive in the sense that were<br/>
&gt; bordering on neglect) developing what I consider to be very unhealthy habits<br/>
&gt; in terms of their basic physical needs. I&#39;ve seen kids become obese at a<br/>
&gt; young age clearly not because of some genetic problem but due to the<br/>
&gt; availability of highly processed high calory foods in the house and nothing<br/>
&gt; else, combined with the availability of sedentary activity and nothing else.<br/>
&gt; This is a pet peeve of mine probably because, while my temperament was such<br/>
&gt; at a young age that I probably would have been much happier to munch away on<br/>
&gt; high-carb foods while reading book after book on the couch, I did get<br/>
&gt; enticed/pushed/encouraged by my parents towards some sort of physical<br/>
&gt; activity (which is probably why we went camping every summer even though my<br/>
&gt; mom wasn&#39;t keen on it) and why there were definitely rules about mealtimes<br/>
&gt; and limits on snacks, etc. I have seen the argument about that kind of<br/>
&gt; &quot;infringement on a child&#39;s freedom&quot; actually causing problems later in life,<br/>
&gt; and speaking of theory vs. specifics, I can agree with it in theory...but<br/>
&gt; what I see in my own life is the opposite: When I think of how hard my<br/>
&gt; parents worked on trying to teach me healthy habits, to me as an adult that<br/>
&gt; is more of a motivator, not less, to try and lead a healthy life. Is there<br/>
&gt; anyone out there not with me on this? Are there no adults on this board who<br/>
&gt; can say they &quot;turned out alright&quot; in some area of their lives, not in spite<br/>
&gt; of the way they were parented (if they were parented with SOME degree of<br/>
&gt; rules, as most of my generation were) but because of it?<br/>
&gt; Again, I do believe in unschooling principles and I&#39;m definitely not<br/>
&gt; advocating excessive and uncalled for regulation of a child life. I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; playing devil&#39;s advocate so to speak, only when I see &quot;all or nothing&quot;<br/>
&gt; reasoning about parenting (vs proactive, careful, balanced reasoning),<br/>
&gt; which just makes me shrug in an &quot;oh my, the pendulum doeth swing&quot; kind of<br/>
&gt; way -kwim?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; As a parent, when a child that doesn&#39;t know better wants<br/>

&gt; &gt; Kids want us to protect them from harm. It would be a betrayal of<br/>
&gt; &gt; their trust if we stood by and let them get hurt. If my husband stood<br/>
&gt; &gt; by while I cut my finger off with a chain saw, I&#39;d be pretty pissed!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The issue is what the definition of &quot;harmful&quot; is. Some parents draw<br/>
&gt; &gt; the harmful line at Twinkies and TV and &quot;too much&quot; computer and R-<br/>
&gt; &gt; rated movies and advertising and sugar and meat and more than one<br/>
&gt; &gt; cookie ...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; A good question to ask, not as a hand tying rule but as an aid as<br/>
&gt; &gt; someone is making the transition from no to yes, is, &quot;Who&#39;s going to<br/>
&gt; &gt; die?&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So, what harm are you talking about? Real life examples are more<br/>
&gt; &gt; useful than vagueness.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I think that is a terrific<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; time for them to learn about moderation, and discernment, and that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; not all<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; foods/activities/etc in our big happy world are created equal.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; We should be discussing the world as we go along in life not grasping<br/>
&gt; &gt; at teachable moments. Too often &quot;teachable moments&quot; is a parent<br/>
&gt; &gt; internally saying &quot;You&#39;re wrong. I&#39;m right. I need you to see the<br/>
&gt; &gt; right way.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If my daughter comes for a second bowl of ice cream she&#39;d appreciate<br/>
&gt; &gt; me saying &quot;We&#39;re eating in 15 minutes.&quot; Then she can use the<br/>
&gt; &gt; information to make a more informed choice. As part of her decision<br/>
&gt; &gt; making, she might ask what we&#39;re having. :-) The right answer is<br/>
&gt; &gt; whatever she decides, not what I think she should do. Part of living<br/>
&gt; &gt; together, she will have gathered the nutritional value of food but<br/>
&gt; &gt; even if she decides she&#39;d rather have more ice cream than dinner,<br/>
&gt; &gt; it&#39;s not a forever decision where this one experience will kill her<br/>
&gt; &gt; or where forever after she&#39;ll decide to have ice cream instead of<br/>
&gt; &gt; dinner. She can use the freedom and experience to assess when it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; right for *her* to have something other than dinner.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; We learn best with the freedom to explore. Part of that freedom is<br/>
&gt; &gt; trying things out to see what happens *to us*. Part of that freedom<br/>
&gt; &gt; is the freedom to put up with the bad parts of something for a while<br/>
&gt; &gt; to get the good parts.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If child is unhappy and feels stuck in a place better than saying no<br/>
&gt; &gt; to what they&#39;re doing is to expand their world so there is more to<br/>
&gt; &gt; choose from. Help them find something else rather than make them do<br/>
&gt; &gt; something else.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; But, again, without a specific example, that&#39;s only vaguely helpful.<br/>

<br/>
I am new to this list. I posted with a book recommendation that I<br/>
think is very supportive of unschooling philosophies and asked for<br/>
other books to read. A mom responded and expressed concerns for her<br/>
child. I gave her a suggestion based on what we did that was<br/>
successful. Suddenly things are snowballing.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why we suggest that new members read for a week or two and read <br/>
the archives for a while before they post.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to &quot;get the feel&quot; of a list and its posters in just a few <br/>
days.<br/>
<br/>
Anything that is posted that is counter to promoting an open, trusting, <br/>
respectful relationship with your child will be questioned.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I have been told that what I did for my child was dangerous and that<br/>
my kids won&#39;t trust me because I&#39;m not going to let them binge on<br/>
Twinkies.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think you are misunderstanding---or putting a weird spin on it.<br/>
<br/>
No one said it was &quot;dangerous.&quot; It certainly seems like an <br/>
over-reaction. What was written was that speech therapy for an eight <br/>
month old is drastic and unnecessary---and could potentially color your <br/>
(and others&#39;) view of your child (as &quot;damaged&quot; or &quot;faulty&quot; or <br/>
&quot;defective&quot;). I&#39;ve never known of an eight month old who could speak <br/>
yet, so why would there need to be an intervention? I know you wrote <br/>
that there were early &quot;signs&quot;---but that&#39;s like saying a four month old <br/>
is delayed in walking because he&#39;s not making some certain kind of leg <br/>
motions or because he decided to crawl backwards for a while. Or a five <br/>
year old is delayed in reading because she&#39;s not writing her name yet.<br/>
<br/>
Early intervention *can* be harmful (not dangerous). It can damage the <br/>
relationship between parent and child. Not that an eight month old will <br/>
know his mom ever even *did* anything about his speech! &lt;g&gt; But in the <br/>
mom&#39;s mind, she thinks she &quot;fixed&quot; a problem. THAT can snowball!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s that way with reading: schools think that they &quot;teach&quot; reading <br/>
with all their lessons and tricks and pressure, but in reality the <br/>
child would have come to reading in just about the same time---withOUT <br/>
all that unnecessary drilling. Patience is BIG. HUGE, but unfortunately <br/>
an under-appreciated and under-used virtue. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The Twinkie thang---no one said &quot;binge on Twinkies&quot; but you. Forbidding <br/>
something---even for their own good---only backfires.<br/>
<br/>
Better is to discuss the pros and cons and let them make decisions (AND <br/>
accepting those choices as OK!!!). Even eating *only* Twinkies for a <br/>
week won&#39;t kill a person or even permanently damage him. But I doubt <br/>
that would be the choice anyone would make if given a wide choice of <br/>
food options. Some kids seem to thrive on nothing but boxed mac & <br/>
cheese and chicken fingers. But not forever---in a healthy home with <br/>
lots of choices. *Eventually* he&#39;ll branch out---if his eating habits <br/>
are accepted and he&#39;s given time to explore food in his own time.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Is this how people on this list normally treat each other?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Meaning....will things posted that are contrary to an open, respectful, <br/>
trusting parent/child relationship be questioned? You betcha!<br/>
<br/>
If you are looking for a list that will support early interventions, <br/>
I&#39;m afraid this really won&#39;t be a good one for you. A LOT of the <br/>
problems with schools (and in our society, in general) stem from the <br/>
idea that we want everyone doing everything at the same rate as <br/>
everyone else---and FASTER/SOONER is BETTER. You won&#39;t find unschoolers <br/>
promoting that.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling accepts that everyone grows and learns at different rates. <br/>
It&#39;s not that we won&#39;t ever pursue aid, it&#39;s just that we will give a <br/>
child more time to develop and accept that he may not be &quot;on time&quot; <br/>
developmentally. We use the word &quot;yet&quot; a lot. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
