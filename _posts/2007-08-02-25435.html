<div id="ygrps-yiv-1772027638">With all of the back-to-school campaigns lately on tv and talk around <br/>
the town, I found myself in panic mode and created a very basic outline <br/>
of &quot;school&quot; stuff to do this year. <br/>
<br/>
My youngest daughter, Kenzie, who just turned 7 had also been asking <br/>
to &quot;do school&quot; - though she&#39;s never been to public school. Kayla is 10 <br/>
and has only been to Kindergarten. Kendall is 14 and went through 4th <br/>
grade. <br/>
<br/>
They did a couple of math workbook pages, wrote spelling lists, and I <br/>
read quite a few books with them. But then I thought, &quot;What the heck am <br/>
I doing??&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Obviously, I still need to deschool myself. I want to unschool, but I <br/>
admit to having trouble trusting the process. How to do I break this <br/>
school-ish mentality and fully embrace Radical Unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
I want to keep track of all they are learning through their play and <br/>
activities - but how do I translate that into &quot;education-ese&quot; so that <br/>
if needed, I could show what they are learning without school?<br/>
<br/>
The girls play alot of games online, watch various tv shows, play dolls <br/>
with Barbies and Bratz, read both fiction and non-fiction books <br/>
(usually animal books), help bake cookies, listen to a variety of music <br/>
(their current favorite is Duran Duran!), draw, paint with fingerpaints <br/>
and watercolors, and probably more that I&#39;m forgetting.<br/>
<br/>
My son has a part-time job working for a place that does custom paint & <br/>
body work on cars, he plays guitar and is self-teaching, changes his <br/>
MySpace page frequently, and talks to friends on IM all of the time. <br/>
<br/>
I would appreciate any advice you can give. Please don&#39;t flame me too <br/>
terribly! :)<br/>
<br/>

they&#39;re doing. Don&#39;t try to look for learning. Most<br/>
learning is invisible. The education-ese is easier to<br/>
pull out over a longer period and depending on where<br/>
you live, you may never need to do it. ( I&#39;m in MA and<br/>
we do have to submit an annual report)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1335005362">Keeping a journal for yourself (whether you type it up in notepad or<br/>
write it in a book or whatever - some folks keep private blogs to jot<br/>
stuff in for themselves) of what you see and hear - that&#39;s transparent<br/>
to the kids. A calendar that you can refer to as a memory jogger - &quot;Oh<br/>
yeah, last Friday we were at the zoo all day with the X family...&quot; and<br/>
so on. Then you can go from there.<br/>
 <br/>
reading fiction and non-fiction is reading, obviously, to start with.<br/>
animal books adds science/biology, possibly geography as well.<br/>
cooking/baking requires reading (recipes), numbers (measuring,<br/>
calculating - if the 1/2 C measure is messy from measuring the oil, how<br/>
do you measure the 1/2 C flour? use 2 1/4 cups - that adds fractions and<br/>
multiplying), nutrition, possibly a bit of science (how come the cookies<br/>
stay mostly flat but the muffins poof up).<br/>
music includes not only music but also possibly culture (Duran Duran is<br/>
&quot;oldies&quot; nowadays yikes! what was the style back then), language (how<br/>
words are used, rhymes, etc)<br/>
painting is art as well as possibly science (seeing colors, mixing<br/>
colors, etc) <br/>
playing with dolls is creative &quot;writing&quot; - that is, they are developing<br/>
scenarios and &quot;dialogue&quot; and such<br/>
 <br/>
various TV shows can be a whole lot of stuff - which shows? Spongebob<br/>
has lots of sea creatures, that&#39;d be marine biology, for example.<br/>
There&#39;s also stuff on friendship, citizenship, etc. Dora includes<br/>
Spanish, Blue&#39;s Clues includes ASL sometimes, etc. Games online - which<br/>
ones? computer skills for sure, possibly number and language skills as<br/>
well.<br/>
 <br/>
Your son has an &#39;internship&#39; in a vocation (like he&#39;d do at a vo-tech<br/>
school), music (learning guitar), computer/web skills, typing (gotta<br/>
keep sharp to keep up with IMing), and so on.<br/>
 <br/>
And, if the kids pick the workbooks and choose when to use them and how<br/>
to use them, great. And when they decide they&#39;d rather do something else<br/>
or maybe decide to use the worksheets as coloring pages instead of<br/>
actually counting or adding or whatever, that&#39;s great too. It&#39;s not so<br/>
much the &quot;what&quot; as the &quot;why&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1597333430">Hi Deb,<br/>
<br/>
My girls got started on Duran Duran after I had seen one of their <br/>
videos on VH1 and showed it them, along with several others. So on <br/>
Kenzie&#39;s birthday a couple weeks ago, she received their greatest <br/>
hits CD as a gift and was thrilled. They listen to a wide variety of <br/>
music because they&#39;ve been exposed to an eclectic mix. :)<br/>
<br/>
Online games - they talk to other girls on Barbie.com and play <br/>
fashion games where they dress up characters. They play regular <br/>
online games and also on NeoPets.com, Cartoon Network, Disney, and <br/>
more.<br/>
<br/>
We also have a PS2 and they love DDR, Guitar Hero, and various other <br/>
games. <br/>
<br/>
TV Shows - They love Hannah Montana, Justice League, Foster&#39;s Home <br/>
for Imaginary Friends, Scooby Doo, Family Guy, Cow & Chicken for <br/>
starters. Kayla also loves Animal Planet.<br/>
<br/>
We bought a couple packages of beads and the girls have been having a <br/>
blast creating bracelets and necklaces. Next week, they want to try a <br/>
paint-by-number kit. This afternoon we&#39;re going to the park after it <br/>
cools off a bit.<br/>
<br/>
I really appreciate your reply. It&#39;s been a huge help! Thank you!<br/>
<br/>
~ Tracy<br/>
