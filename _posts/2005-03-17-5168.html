<div id="ygrps-yiv-944223748">I have to reply and hope that it will make it on this subject.  My <br/>
family just put our television away for a month at the beginning of <br/>
March.  The relationship between my children has changed for the <br/>
better, my husband and I have more time to really talk to each <br/>
other.  And we have not had cable - just a few network channels, and <br/>
watched movies that we own or rent.  There are several books out <br/>
there - Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television and another <br/>
one called TV turn off if you are interested in resources.  Studies <br/>
have shown that when we watch television our bodies go into a <br/>
comatose like state - breathing slows, brain activity hums along <br/>
sluggishly with barely a blip on the radar.  As heavy television <br/>
viewers, we are merely spectators in life.  And while I think that <br/>
there are wonderful resources for our families available in things <br/>
such as nature videos and the history channel - a good book will do <br/>
the same.  A child can really pause and contemplate over pictures of <br/>
let&#39;s say a Civil War soldier rather than having hundreds of images <br/>
thrust at him rapid speed.  As Americans we are so used to having <br/>
everything fast and easy.  Those fact thrown at us at mach speed do <br/>
not equate real learning.  Cave children watching their family <br/>
members live in real life, where there were actual people to talk to <br/>
that they were interacting with cannot be equated to our children <br/>
watching sex, violence, and poo on television.  And who is to say <br/>
that those novels weren&#39;t the downfall of our society?  Do we still <br/>
live with Victorian morals and values?   Television is like giving <br/>
your children a drug.  I know there will be fall out from this <br/>
comment and defensiveness - but I challenge you to take it out of <br/>
your homes for even a week and see if there is a difference in your <br/>
children.  As unschooling parents, you are surely willing to try <br/>
something new, different, out of the ordinary.  <br/>

Well, whoever did these studies sure haven&#39;t seen my kids watch TV! LOL!<br/>
Our TV is on and there&#39;s not a comatose-like state to be seen!  And I don&#39;t<br/>
have to take away our television for a week to see if there&#39;s a &quot;difference&quot;<br/>
in my children...some weeks are just too busy to have it on...then the next<br/>
week, it&#39;s nice to have for some down time!  And books are fine...for those<br/>
who read well or enjoy reading...but reading isn&#39;t for everyone.  I would no<br/>
more insist that someone who dislikes TV get all their info from TV anymore<br/>
than I would insist that someone who doesn&#39;t enjoy reading get all their<br/>
info from books.  Resources are all around us...<br/>

movies (even in theaters), video games are ALL active events for DS -<br/>
 he&#39;s almost 7. That he&#39;s moving, interacting, thinking even in <br/>
theaters (where there&#39;s not much else to do - unless you&#39;re a <br/>
teenager in the balcony lol) shows that watching TV, movies, etc <br/>
does not *necessarily* and *unequivocally* put one into a &quot;comatose&quot; <br/>
state. At home, TV and movies are usually accompanied by other <br/>
activities - related or unrelated. Yes, there are times of sitting <br/>
and watching, but they are generally in between periods of moving <br/>
and doing. That seems about normal to me - move around and do, then <br/>
sit and rest, then move around, and so on. And for unwinding at the <br/>
end of the day before sleep, breathing and brain activity slowing is <br/>
a *good* thing, isn&#39;t it?</div>

There are things about our society that I definitely don&#39;t like or agree  <br/>
with, but who is to say we are in downfall?  Nearly every society has  customs, <br/>
laws and behaviors that others would find reprehensible.  <br/>
 <br/>
If you don&#39;t like television, don&#39;t have one.  I don&#39;t like plenty of  things <br/>
and I choose not to do them.  If my child showed an interest in  these <br/>
things, I would have to reexamine my opinion or find a way to help him  pursue them. <br/>
 <br/>
*I* like watching television.  I grew up in a television watching  family.  <br/>
We are amazingly able to manage our lives, are relatively  intelligent and have <br/>
the ability to interact very well with other people.   I&#39;m sure our lives <br/>
would have been different if we didn&#39;t watch, but not  better....just different.<br/>
 <br/>
As for interacting with real people, in my small southern conservative  town, <br/>
I find television to be far more stimulating and intellectually  challenging.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Someone made this point a while ago and I did some delving into the <br/>
research:<br/>
<br/>
==========<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; And, actually a study was done that shows that some children, a <br/>
&gt;&gt; limited<br/>
&gt;&gt; number, do not think while &quot;zoning&quot; in front of the boob tube. Some <br/>
&gt;&gt; children<br/>
&gt;&gt; actually go into an almost sleep/dream state, a sort of self-hypnosis <br/>
&gt;&gt; in<br/>
&gt;&gt; which they brain waves patterns indicate no active thought patterns.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Can you site a source for this? I can&#39;t seem to find one. What I did <br/>
&gt; find<br/>
&gt; (over and over and over) is a quote from &quot;Battle for Your Mind: <br/>
&gt; Subliminal<br/>
&gt; Programming&quot;: by Dick Sutphen:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Recent tests by researcher Herbert Krugman showed that, while viewers <br/>
&gt; were<br/>
&gt; watching TV, right-brain activity outnumbered left-brain activity by a <br/>
&gt; ratio<br/>
&gt; of two to one. Put more simply, the viewers were in an altered state . <br/>
&gt; . .<br/>
&gt; in trance more often than not. They were getting their Beta-endorphin <br/>
&gt; &quot;fix.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To measure attention spans, psychophysiologist Thomas Mulholland of the<br/>
&gt; Veterans Hospital in Bedford, Massachusetts, attached young viewers to <br/>
&gt; an<br/>
&gt; EEG machine that was wired to shut the TV set off whenever the <br/>
&gt; children&#39;s<br/>
&gt; brains produced a majority of alpha waves. Although the children were <br/>
&gt; told<br/>
&gt; to concentrate, only a few could keep the set on for more than 30 <br/>
&gt; seconds!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Left brain activity (according to an anatomy and physiology text) is<br/>
&gt; associated with spoken and written language, numerical and scientific <br/>
&gt; skills<br/>
&gt; and reasoning. Right brain activity is associated with musical and <br/>
&gt; artistic<br/>
&gt; awareness, space and pattern perception, insight, imagination, <br/>
&gt; generating<br/>
&gt; mental images to compare spatial relationships. (No connection is made<br/>
&gt; between right brained activities and being in a trance like state.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; From that list, it makes sense to me that TV watching would be a right<br/>
&gt; brained activity. I suppose if there&#39;s something inherently wrong with <br/>
&gt; right<br/>
&gt; brained activities, we should stop kids from drawing and imagining and <br/>
&gt; being<br/>
&gt; insightful.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The text says that alpha waves are present in the EEGs of nearly all <br/>
&gt; normal<br/>
&gt; individuals when they are awake and resting with their eyes closed. <br/>
&gt; These<br/>
&gt; waves disappear entirely during sleep. Beta waves generally appear <br/>
&gt; when the<br/>
&gt; nervous system is active, that is, during periods of sensory input and<br/>
&gt; mental activity. (Not that it says generally.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; (Just as an interesting factoid, it says delta waves occur during deep <br/>
&gt; sleep<br/>
&gt; but they are also normal in an awake infant.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Another site says alpha waves are brought out by closing the eyes and <br/>
&gt; by<br/>
&gt; relaxation, and abolished by eye opening or alerting by any mechanism<br/>
&gt; (thinking, calculating). It is the major rhythm seen in normal relaxed<br/>
&gt; adults - it is present during most of life especially beyond the <br/>
&gt; thirteenth<br/>
&gt; year when it dominates the resting tracing. (Alpha waves are also <br/>
&gt; present<br/>
&gt; during meditation and hypnosis.) And that beta waves are the dominant <br/>
&gt; rhythm<br/>
&gt; in patients who are alert or anxious or who have their eyes open.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That would suggest people aren&#39;t thinking when they watch TV. But does <br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; make sense? I could list off a huge number of things that I&#39;ve learned <br/>
&gt; from<br/>
&gt; watching TV. How can learning take place without thinking? There is <br/>
&gt; also<br/>
&gt; research into Controlling Computers With Neural Signals (in Scientific<br/>
&gt; American) which uses Alpha and Mu waves. If alpha waves stop when <br/>
&gt; thought<br/>
&gt; happens, how could those waves be used to perform a computer action if <br/>
&gt; we<br/>
&gt; have to stop thinking in order to generate them?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What it really means is that people enjoy dabbling in pseudo-science. <br/>
&gt; They<br/>
&gt; are using faulty logic -- hypnosis may generate alpha but that doesn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; mean<br/>
&gt; alpha indicates hypnosis, thinking may generate beta but that doesn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; mean<br/>
&gt; that beta indicates thinking (or that lack of beta means lack of <br/>
&gt; thinking)<br/>
&gt; -- to draw a conclusion to fit their theory.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To get a more complete picture we need to know what the waves look <br/>
&gt; like when<br/>
&gt; we&#39;re deeply involved in a novel. Or watching a play. Or playing a <br/>
&gt; video<br/>
&gt; game. Or watching a sporting event. Or painting. Or gazing down at a<br/>
&gt; sleeping or nursing infant. (Not that it would indicate anything. It <br/>
&gt; would<br/>
&gt; just be more data on how the brain operates.) If alpha waves increased<br/>
&gt; during those times, should we stop those things? Or does it merely <br/>
&gt; mean that<br/>
&gt; “thinking stops alpha waves” and “beta is present during mental <br/>
&gt; activity”<br/>
&gt; are too simplistic and don&#39;t adequately describe what&#39;s going on?<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And while I think that<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A book can&#39;t show you a running cheetah. A historical novel can&#39;t show <br/>
you how historical people dressed or what their homes looked like.<br/>
<br/>
Saying that a book and the images you can create are superior to seeing <br/>
the images that same book creates for a visual artist is like saying we <br/>
shouldn&#39;t look at the works of famous artists because we can create our <br/>
own images.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t create a fraction of the images that the hundreds of visual <br/>
artists created for Lord of the Rings. For others with a visual bent <br/>
those images are just as inspiring as the words are to those with a <br/>
linguistic bent.<br/>
<br/>
Just as writers can&#39;t write without reading what others have written, <br/>
visual artists can&#39;t create without having seen what others have <br/>
visually created.<br/>
<br/>
For those with high linguistic intelligence books and words are great. <br/>
Visuals and body movement and music and so forth are not quite as <br/>
important to them for gaining information. For those with high visual <br/>
intelligence depriving them of visuals and telling them books are <br/>
better is as bad as depriving a linguistic person of their books and <br/>
giving them visuals, or depriving a kinesthetic person of movement or a <br/>
musical person of music.<br/>
<br/>
If you aren&#39;t aware of Howard Gardner&#39;s theory of Multiple <br/>
Intelligences, Google &quot;Gardner Multiple Intelligences&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; A child can really pause and contemplate over pictures of<br/>
&gt; let&#39;s say a Civil War soldier rather than having hundreds of images<br/>
&gt; thrust at him rapid speed.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And videos can be paused.<br/>
<br/>
But what evidence do you have that gazing at static pictures is <br/>
superior to moving pictures? Most people would choose real life <br/>
experience over a book and real life experience can&#39;t be paused and is <br/>
chock full of stimulation of the other senses. By your reasoning real <br/>
life should be the worst way to learn.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Those fact thrown at us at mach speed do<br/>
&gt; not equate real learning.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, what evidence do you have?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but I challenge you to take it out of<br/>
&gt; your homes for even a week and see if there is a difference in your<br/>
&gt; children.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If your child had been inspired by books to create over a 1000 pages of <br/>
comics and a 50,000 word novel, would it make any sense to take his <br/>
books away? That&#39;s what TV has helped my daughter do.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Did you even read my post about my family and TV? My kids are 14, 17, <br/>
and 20 - so we&#39;re a much better case study than any you could find in a <br/>
book. Unschooled nearly grown kids who have had freedom-of-tv for their <br/>
whole lives.<br/>
<br/>
And I know others, too.<br/>
<br/>
If YOUR family can&#39;t keep tv in the house without it interfering with <br/>
the rest of your lives - then I&#39;m guessing the parents have a problem, <br/>
not the kids. Toss it out, if that is what you want. You&#39;re giving up <br/>
an incredibly amazing resource out of fear and maybe unwillingness to <br/>
examine and change your own baggage. Because - you&#39;re simply wrong - I <br/>
know this because it only takes one family to prove your wrong. TV is <br/>
NOT a drug - if it was a drug, it would be inevitable - having a tv <br/>
would put MY kids into that coma-like state that your kids apparently <br/>
went into in front of the tv. But it doesn&#39;t do that to my kids. Mine <br/>
think and enjoy and critically examine what they are watching and learn <br/>
a lot and I can unequivocally state that they definitely do NOT turn <br/>
their brains off when they turn the tv on.<br/>
<br/>
Not one of those studies has EVER been done on unschooled kids. Not one.<br/>
<br/>
Television in NOTHING like a drug. That&#39;s nothing but loaded <br/>
terminology designed to keep people from thinking clearly for <br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d DARE you to look at my children and say they&#39;ve been drugged by tv <br/>
in any way, shape or form.<br/>
<br/>
Parents are, in general, afraid (I don&#39;t blame them) and all that <br/>
generalized fear often gets concentrated on tv for various fairly <br/>
complex reasons - but one is because it is straightforward to control - <br/>
it has an on and off switch. It is something parents can &quot;do&quot; and it <br/>
even involves a little self-sacrifice to make them feel even more like <br/>
maybe it&#39;ll ward off bad things that might happen to their kids.<br/>
<br/>
It is a lot easier, i guess, to just unplug the tv and put it away, <br/>
toss it out, than to accept that we might not be providing as <br/>
interesting, stimulating, encouraging, fun, exciting alternatives as we <br/>
could and should as unschooling parents.<br/>
<br/>
If what your family is doing now, with the tv gone, was always <br/>
available, and if it is better, then why weren&#39;t you turning off the tv <br/>
and doing those things before?  Don&#39;t blame the tv if you weren&#39;t <br/>
creating a life that was as good as tv. When parents get rid of the tv <br/>
and then start playing games and reading to their kids - of COURSE that <br/>
is cool. But - why not just play games and read AND talk AND have a tv? <br/>
Works fine for us.<br/>

that my children don&#39;t watch any tv. There has been somebody home all <br/>
day today - my kids and husband and I have come and gone - but nobody <br/>
has turned on the tv one single time.<br/>
<br/>
But - so what? That&#39;s nothing to be proud of, in particular, either. <br/>
We&#39;re all just too busy for much tv-watching these days. Roxana is at <br/>
rehearsal for the musical in which she is currently performing. Rosie <br/>
is at soccer practice now - spent the day at a Destination Imagination <br/>
meeting, karate practice, played RISK with some other kids for 4 hours. <br/>
Roya had a class (she&#39;s a college student), did a phone interview of <br/>
the assistant-director of Not Back to School Camp and typed that all up <br/>
for a class (she&#39;s majoring in recreation - wants to run camps, <br/>
herself), and is now off to meet some friends to study together. Her <br/>
boyfriend is driving in tonight to spend the weekend and go to a gaming <br/>
convention and we&#39;re all going camping next week. It is VERY likely <br/>
that nobody will watch any tv from now until maybe a week from tomorrow <br/>
when we get home from camping. Or maybe somebody will watch something <br/>
briefly tonight. Possible - maybe some West Wing. Or maybe not - last <br/>
weekend her boyfriend was here and we spent a lot of time playing cards <br/>
and playing a game called &quot;Wise and Otherwise.&quot; (GREAT game - we <br/>
laughed so hard!!) This weekend he is bringing a game from home that he <br/>
thinks we&#39;ll all love. So more than likely we&#39;ll get started playing <br/>
that - and not watch tv at all. But if we DO all decide to watch tv, <br/>
we&#39;ll probably watch something together and we&#39;ll eat popcorn and be <br/>
happy. I really fail to see anything wrong with this picture.<br/>

It&#39;s easy to get into ruts. It&#39;s easy to watch tv if you are feeling <br/>
poorly--physically, mentally, emotionally. That&#39;s the not a problem <br/>
with tv. <br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid and didn&#39;t like most of what was on tv, I read a ton <br/>
when I was feeling low. Rereading a fiction book for the tenth time <br/>
probably didn&#39;t stimulate my brain too much, but that wasn&#39;t the <br/>
fault of the book.<br/>

We&#39;ve been inside watching tons of tv and I&#39;m tired of it. I want it <br/>
to be spring and have a baby in my arms instead of my belly! I know I <br/>
haven&#39;t offered enough to my kids lately and it&#39;s gotten to all of <br/>
us. When the two year old starts slowly explaining places you can <br/>
take her, you know you need to get out! But it&#39;s my job as a parent <br/>
to offer, strew, suggest, joyfully lead, etc. not to forbid something <br/>
just to make the other options more likely to be accepted.<br/>

me understand that my intelligent child is very capable of learning every<br/>
moment from everything around him. <br/>
<br/>
I think taking away something my child likes *would* make a difference. <br/>
I think he&#39;d think less of me.  He&#39;d have no reason to trust me, no<br/>

No -- and thank goodness!  Victorial morals and values involved a caste-system, with women as second or third class citizens.  If early dime novels can be given the credit for that, then most of us owe a huge debt to those novelists.<br/>

We have three TVs with cable, and it&#39;s not unusual at all for us to go several days in the summer without any TV being on.  Just because we have access to TV doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re enslaved by it.<br/>
 <br/>
I also question your point that pondering a good book can be as valuable as a historical video.  I&#39;ve always loved history as a topic, and I love books, but even I can admit I often get more out of a video than I would have gotten from the historical books available in most libraries.  For my son, who is wired much more to remember what he hears, and is dramatic and kinesthetic, books just don&#39;t do what a TV show with rich colors, memorable spoken words and lots of &#39;real&#39; action can do.  Just no comparison.  Not everyone learns the same way you do, yanno.<br/>

I&#39;m guessing none of these studies have included subjects who spent their days doing what they chose to do, when they chose to do it, as our unschooled kids live their days.  Probably nothing but school kids and working adults, for whom TV time is the first opportunity to rest their bodies and brains, and to own their lives for a few precious moments before homework or chore time. No wonder those poor folks are comatose in front of a TV -- they&#39;d probably be equally comatose involved in conversation or trying to read a book.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-70640822">So many good responses have already been shared but I just wanted to throw<br/>
in another one for the heck of it.  My kids are 8 and 10 and they have had<br/>
free access to satellite TV for several years.  They are very selective<br/>
about the time they spend watching.  They only watch when they are<br/>
interested in what is on.  But we didn&#39;t always have satellite TV nor did I<br/>
always let them have free access.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When they were little (2,3,4) , they didn&#39;t ask to watch TV much and I<br/>
didn&#39;t encourage it. Actually, my oldest didn&#39;t like it much and there were<br/>
days that I wished she&#39;d watch at least a half an hour of TV to give me a<br/>
little break. :-)  As they got a little older (5,6 ish) they started to like<br/>
it more and want to watch it more on some days.  That was when I got a<br/>
little nervous about it and started to limit it.  We only had a few channels<br/>
at the time and videos, but I had read about those studies (not really<br/>
thought about it) and I didn&#39;t want to mess my kids up by letting them watch<br/>
too much TV.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Most of the time life was busy enough that TV wasn&#39;t a major draw, but once<br/>
in a while, they&#39;d want to watch more than I was comfortable with.  I felt<br/>
like if I set a rule about the amount of time they could watch, that when<br/>
that time was up, they&#39;d be no arguments.  I could blame it on the rule.<br/>
So, I made a rule that they could each pick a show and each watch each<br/>
other&#39;s show and then the TV would be off for the day. &lt;live and learn&gt;<br/>
Having that rule made watching TV seem much more valuable than it had seemed<br/>
before we had that rule.  It stopped the arguing after the first few days<br/>
because I was pretty consistent about it, but it did nothing to enhance my<br/>
relationship with my children.  In fact, it made them angry with me and it<br/>
made them feel controlled.  They saw it for what it was, an arbitrary rule<br/>
that I enforced upon them.  They started watching TV every day to make sure<br/>
they got what they were due.  Before the rule, often days would pass and no<br/>
one would even turn the TV on.  Now it was on every day so they felt they<br/>
got their fair share.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Then, after reading on different unschooling lists, I realized how unfair I<br/>
had been.  I started saying YES if they asked to watch more than their one<br/>
show.  I stopped saying no, altogether.  Sometime in there, we ended up<br/>
getting satellite TV with a lot of channels.  (We&#39;ve had it so long I can&#39;t<br/>
remember living without it now.maybe 5 years ago.)  There were days when<br/>
they watched more TV than I was comfortable with (sometimes all day long)<br/>
but it was when they finally realized that I wasn&#39;t going to limit their<br/>
viewing anymore that they became more selective in their viewing choices.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Our lives are interesting and full and TV is just another option, not one<br/>
that they are drawn to more than any other activity.  (because it&#39;s not<br/>
limited and because we have an interesting life)   They love games and being<br/>
read to and horse back riding and playing with their friends, etc.  I think<br/>
I got the most benefit out of changing my view on TV.  I used to feel some<br/>
level of guilt whenever I watched TV. Our society sees watching TV as a<br/>
waste of time and I fell for that.  I always used to feel like I had to do<br/>
something useful while I watched TV, like knit or something.  After I did a<br/>
lot of thinking about how TV affects our personal lives (it doesn&#39;t make me<br/>
or my kids into zombies and we often learn so much from it)   I chose to<br/>
leave that feeling of guilt behind. I no longer feel guilty about enjoying<br/>
TV.  I also stopped counting the hours that we watch TV because I stopped<br/>
judging the value of it.  I am on longer obsessed with how much or how<br/>
little TV we watch.  We just watch it when we want to and turn it off when<br/>
we don&#39;t.  Some days we watch more than others and some days and weeks (in<br/>
the warmer weather) we don&#39;t even turn it on.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
They are free to watch whatever they want.  If it is something that I find<br/>
questionable (which doesn&#39;t happen very often) I make sure to sit with them<br/>
so I can answer any questions that they might have.  It hasn&#39;t been a<br/>
problem.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This morning the girls watched Kid Concoctions (although my 10 yo was<br/>
looking for Arthur) and another half hour show (?) and turned it off.  They<br/>
are now playing horses on the living room rug.  We&#39;ll be heading to the barn<br/>
soon.  The vet comes to give spring shots to the horses today.  That should<br/>
be fun to watch.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I am so glad I relaxed about TV and stopped letting it *rule* our home.  As<br/>
other&#39;s have said, I think it is the responsibility of the unschooling<br/>
parent to make life interesting for their unschooled kids.  If TV is the<br/>
most interesting thing in your whole day, then you need to help your<br/>
children find out what their interests are.  Not just so they won&#39;t watch TV<br/>
all day but because that&#39;s what a good unschooling parent does.  They help<br/>
their children find interesting things to do and see and go.  <br/>

  Subject: RE: [unschoolingbasics] Television Turn-off<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  So many good responses have already been shared but I just wanted to throw<br/>
  in another one for the heck of it.  My kids are 8 and 10 and they have had<br/>
  free access to satellite TV for several years.  They are very selective<br/>
  about the time they spend watching.  They only watch when they are<br/>
  interested in what is on.  But we didn&#39;t always have satellite TV nor did I<br/>
  always let them have free access.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  When they were little (2,3,4) , they didn&#39;t ask to watch TV much and I<br/>
  didn&#39;t encourage it. Actually, my oldest didn&#39;t like it much and there were<br/>
  days that I wished she&#39;d watch at least a half an hour of TV to give me a<br/>
  little break. :-)  As they got a little older (5,6 ish) they started to like<br/>
  it more and want to watch it more on some days.  That was when I got a<br/>
  little nervous about it and started to limit it.  We only had a few channels<br/>
  at the time and videos, but I had read about those studies (not really<br/>
  thought about it) and I didn&#39;t want to mess my kids up by letting them watch<br/>
  too much TV.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Most of the time life was busy enough that TV wasn&#39;t a major draw, but once<br/>
  in a while, they&#39;d want to watch more than I was comfortable with.  I felt<br/>
  like if I set a rule about the amount of time they could watch, that when<br/>
  that time was up, they&#39;d be no arguments.  I could blame it on the rule.<br/>
  So, I made a rule that they could each pick a show and each watch each<br/>
  other&#39;s show and then the TV would be off for the day. &lt;live and learn&gt;<br/>
  Having that rule made watching TV seem much more valuable than it had seemed<br/>
  before we had that rule.  It stopped the arguing after the first few days<br/>
  because I was pretty consistent about it, but it did nothing to enhance my<br/>
  relationship with my children.  In fact, it made them angry with me and it<br/>
  made them feel controlled.  They saw it for what it was, an arbitrary rule<br/>
  that I enforced upon them.  They started watching TV every day to make sure<br/>
  they got what they were due.  Before the rule, often days would pass and no<br/>
  one would even turn the TV on.  Now it was on every day so they felt they<br/>
  got their fair share.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Then, after reading on different unschooling lists, I realized how unfair I<br/>
  had been.  I started saying YES if they asked to watch more than their one<br/>
  show.  I stopped saying no, altogether.  Sometime in there, we ended up<br/>
  getting satellite TV with a lot of channels.  (We&#39;ve had it so long I can&#39;t<br/>
  remember living without it now.maybe 5 years ago.)  There were days when<br/>
  they watched more TV than I was comfortable with (sometimes all day long)<br/>
  but it was when they finally realized that I wasn&#39;t going to limit their<br/>
  viewing anymore that they became more selective in their viewing choices.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Our lives are interesting and full and TV is just another option, not one<br/>
  that they are drawn to more than any other activity.  (because it&#39;s not<br/>
  limited and because we have an interesting life)   They love games and being<br/>
  read to and horse back riding and playing with their friends, etc.  I think<br/>
  I got the most benefit out of changing my view on TV.  I used to feel some<br/>
  level of guilt whenever I watched TV. Our society sees watching TV as a<br/>
  waste of time and I fell for that.  I always used to feel like I had to do<br/>
  something useful while I watched TV, like knit or something.  After I did a<br/>
  lot of thinking about how TV affects our personal lives (it doesn&#39;t make me<br/>
  or my kids into zombies and we often learn so much from it)   I chose to<br/>
  leave that feeling of guilt behind. I no longer feel guilty about enjoying<br/>
  TV.  I also stopped counting the hours that we watch TV because I stopped<br/>
  judging the value of it.  I am on longer obsessed with how much or how<br/>
  little TV we watch.  We just watch it when we want to and turn it off when<br/>
  we don&#39;t.  Some days we watch more than others and some days and weeks (in<br/>
  the warmer weather) we don&#39;t even turn it on.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  They are free to watch whatever they want.  If it is something that I find<br/>
  questionable (which doesn&#39;t happen very often) I make sure to sit with them<br/>
  so I can answer any questions that they might have.  It hasn&#39;t been a<br/>
  problem.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  This morning the girls watched Kid Concoctions (although my 10 yo was<br/>
  looking for Arthur) and another half hour show (?) and turned it off.  They<br/>
  are now playing horses on the living room rug.  We&#39;ll be heading to the barn<br/>
  soon.  The vet comes to give spring shots to the horses today.  That should<br/>
  be fun to watch.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I am so glad I relaxed about TV and stopped letting it *rule* our home.  As<br/>
  other&#39;s have said, I think it is the responsibility of the unschooling<br/>
  parent to make life interesting for their unschooled kids.  If TV is the<br/>
  most interesting thing in your whole day, then you need to help your<br/>
  children find out what their interests are.  Not just so they won&#39;t watch TV<br/>
  all day but because that&#39;s what a good unschooling parent does.  They help<br/>
  their children find interesting things to do and see and go.  <br/>

Thanks Teresa.  It helps to know that the things I take the time to write<br/>
