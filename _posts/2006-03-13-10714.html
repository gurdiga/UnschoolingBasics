Holy cow!! You&#39;ve got some really creative and HIlarious children!<br/>
Great sense of humor.<br/>

My nephew Tristan (Heidi&#39;s child, for those that know her) has some<br/>
pretty intense moments. I distracted him once by offering to make him<br/>
a &quot;poopy shake&quot;. It was chocolate of course, but the giddy laughter<br/>
brought all the other kids out of the woodwork and poopy shakes are<br/>
still a request years later.:)<br/>
We love gross and weird around here.  I like your children&#39;s ideas of<br/>
what constitutes a &quot;club&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
My girls are into that same type of humor.  They&#39;ve had a variety of clubs<br/>
over the years; most memorably the Fear Factor club where they had members<br/>
eat cat poops (made from chocolate, peanut butter and dried milk) out of a<br/>
litter box with dried milk as the kitty litter) and other gross looking<br/>
stuff.  It was fun for all and the ages of the kids present varied a lot.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-44742536">What my kids have been doing lately.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve all been into neopets since the beginning of December.  It&#39;s wicked<br/>
fun!  I&#39;d heard everyone talk about it for a long time before I decided to<br/>
sit there for a couple hours and figure out how to navigate the site and<br/>
make some money.  I am glad I did.  To think I would have missed playing<br/>
Hasee Bounce every day.  <br/>
<br/>
The girls are riding more now that it&#39;s warming up and now that Lilly has a<br/>
pony that doesn&#39;t take off on her or buck her off.  His name is Skippy and<br/>
we&#39;ve had him since the middle of January and he is working out VERY well.<br/>
We just love him so.  He&#39;s got an awesome personality too.<br/>
<br/>
The girls are involved in pony club and they love that too.  They&#39;ve both<br/>
been preparing another presentation to give this week.  (they earn pony<br/>
bucks which they can spend at the end of the year on tack and stuff)  Lilly<br/>
is doing a presentation on vices and Leigh is doing one on abscesses, I<br/>
think.)<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ve been into writing stories again.  They go through phases where they<br/>
spend a lot of time writing stories and then they take a break.  We<br/>
occasionally play mail too, where we all write letters to each other.<br/>
<br/>
Both girls are taking more of an interest in cooking on their own.  They<br/>
frequently make horse treats and occasionally make something else.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m reading Stormy, Misty&#39;s foal to them.  They spend a lot of time pouring<br/>
over horse magazines and writing emails.  They both have pen pals that they<br/>
enjoy writing too also.<br/>
<br/>
I know I am missing a bunch of stuff but those are the things that pop into<br/>
my head right now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2062349793">What we have been doing lately:<br/>
<br/>
Adriane (15) decided to quit her job and get ready for her driver&#39;s license.  She is working about about 15hours per week with her gymnastics and decided to take a few group classes with a tutor this year.  She is enjoying hanging with the group of kids but is getting pretty tired of the classes.  She just finished up her animal projects for 4-H (she is the club president)and is busily spending the money.  She just finished a baking contest through 4-H.<br/>
<br/>
Zach (12) is huge into yu-gi-oh.  He spends a lot of time researching cheats and talking with friends about the games and cards.  He is helping his younger brother with baseball.  Zach is also an officer with our 4-H club and shoots skeet competitively with them (he got 24 in a row yesterday!!)<br/>
<br/>
Marsie (9) is taking an English riding class.  She loves swimming and hanging out with animals.  She is attending a church class at the local Baptist church (primarily for the food and games &lt;sigh&gt;) which is interesting since the rest of the family is either agnostic or pagan.<br/>
<br/>
Dan (7) is on a baseball team for the first time this spring.  He is a modern day Tom Sawyer, always barefooted and climbing trees and having adventures.  He loves few things more than roadkill bones.<br/>
<br/>
Michelle (6) is our artist.  She spends hours every day coloring and painting, cutting and decorating.  She just learned to rollerskate and is keeping the driveway hot.<br/>
<br/>
Jerry (46) is busy with golf and is a volunteer fireman.  He is getting more into 4-H with us and helping care for animals.<br/>
<br/>
Julie (42) is taking an herbalism class and loves watching &quot;The Dog Whisperer&quot; to help with the loving but insane dogs we have.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1530565292">Thanks. I&#39;m pretty sure that most people around here would frown upon  <br/>
it, but it&#39;s really funny to listen to them and join in. Next time  <br/>
they do that I&#39;m going to follow Angela&#39;s cat poop recipe. They are  <br/>
going to fall over laughing! What I love best is how hard they work  <br/>
to make sure everyone&#39;s in there. Emily does, every once in a while,  <br/>
say that she needs to not have boys around, but I figure that this is  <br/>
fair, and we work on how to make everyone happy with that choice.  <br/>
What happens is after about 20 minutes, she works through her issues,  <br/>
and she makes &quot;excuses&quot; for why Dan can come in, then she tells Sam  <br/>
that he is a special occasion. It&#39;s hilarious....<br/>

<br/>
They also dug night crawlers, a lot of them and had the kids hold a huge<br/>
handful of night crawlers in their hands for a certain amount of time.<br/>
Searching for the night crawlers was fun too.  My dds spent days planning<br/>
the clubs.  She&#39;s been talking about doing another one but all her friends<br/>
are schooled now and it&#39;s so hard to coordinate their schedules and get them<br/>
all here at once.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One of my favorite &#39;gross&#39; foods is Kitty Litter dessert. It&#39;s yummy <br/>
but looks pretty realistic. It&#39;s a vanilla pudding (or banana <br/>
pudding if you choose, but it needs to be a neutral beigeish color) <br/>
with crumbed pecan sandies cookies on top and mini-tootsie rolls <br/>
tucked in &#39;strategically&#39; as the cat poo. warning: may cause havoc <br/>
with some types of dental work as the tootsies get pretty firm when <br/>
refrigerated<br/>

crude around our house.  And I burst out laughing at the kitty litter desert<br/>
... that&#39;s great (thanks to who posted it).  These things would be totally<br/>
