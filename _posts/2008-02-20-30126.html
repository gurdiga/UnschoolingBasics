***You may be thinking of HSWatch. Search Yahoo Groups for that name.<br/>
<br/>
***This has generally been a good list, usually very low volume as there haven&#39;t been very many legal threats for hsers to fight off, despite various organizations&#39; claims. <br/>
<br/>
***The list has recently been through a brouhaha when it veered off into religious discussions but I think it is back on track now. <br/>
<br/>
***The list is run by Kay Brooks from TN.<br/>
