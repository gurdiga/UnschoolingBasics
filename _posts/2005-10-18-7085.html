<div id="ygrps-yiv-876990030">I have similiar health issues and need my rest at night.  My dd gets <br/>
off the computer when I go to bed and she watches TV in her room so <br/>
that she doesn&#39;t disturb me.  In the beginning I was having trouble <br/>
like you are.  We sat down as a family and this was the solution we <br/>
came up with.  Hope that helps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1291084122">Thank you Kay. It is nice for me to know there is another mother out there who is unschooling who has health issues of her own to balance into the mix :)  Sitting down to discuss things as a family before the event occurs sounds intuitively right in my situation :) Joanne<br/>
