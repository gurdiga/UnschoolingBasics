interesting points.  This may be old news for the unschooling board <br/>
veterans but I thought the newbies like me might be interested in the <br/>
books.  Amazon has snippets of the book you can peruse to get the <br/>
general facts about what Summerhill is all about.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1311263543">I second the PP about recommending the Sudbury schools if interested<br/>
in this. Summerhill was first published in the US in the late 1960s,<br/>
though it&#39;s much older than that, and its publication triggered a wave<br/>
of free schools at that time including Sudbury school. Many schools<br/>
flamed out but there are ones from that time period still going strong. <br/>
<br/>
I am interested in opening some sort of free school down the road,<br/>
perhaps a Sudbury school. I really like the idea of it and I like the<br/>
opportunity to bring an unschooling experience to kids who otherwise<br/>
may not get it. I know this topic is a bit off for this forum so feel<br/>
free to contact me off list if you want to talk about it at all.</div>
