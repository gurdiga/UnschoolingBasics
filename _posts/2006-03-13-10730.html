<div id="ygrps-yiv-1870943941">I am a homeschool mom to seven boys! We have been homeschoolers since &quot;day one,&quot; <br/>
which has been eight years ago, but unschoolers for the past four months, or so. I can see <br/>
where everytime we&#39;ve &quot;done school,&quot; we always get burned out and frustrated and just <br/>
not liking it, at all....myself or the boys. The unschooling method makes so much sense in <br/>
my heart, but getting it through my head is something else. It seems anytime I suggest <br/>
something for the boys to do, things I know is fun for them, they don&#39;t want to. It seems <br/>
they do nothing but video games, computer games or play outside (which doesn&#39;t seem to <br/>
involve any imagination).<br/>
<br/>
I am the oldest child of two children and a typical firstborn....very black and white, <br/>
systematic in theory, and struggle with perfectionism. I know I need to deschool, myself. It <br/>
just seems that our days consists of nothing but chores and video games. I know that&#39;s the <br/>
beauty of unschooling, yet shouldn&#39;t there be more structure and helping them in their <br/>
interests/hobbies???<br/>
<br/>
I really, really want to do this and want it to work for us. I&#39;ve bought more books to read <br/>
and the book written by other unschoolers and where they are today. <br/>
<br/>
It just helps to speak to others and their experiences. I&#39;m looking forward to hearing from <br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
a new unschooler, Lawrita</div>

 </span></blockquote>Welcome Lawrita. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re giving unschooling a try. It does take awhile to wrap your brain around the concept, but once you do you&#39;ll wonder why you ever bothered doing school.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;It seems anytime I suggest something for the boys to do, things I know is fun for them, they don&#39;t want to. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They&#39;re probably thinking it&#39;s going to turn into a lesson somehow. Give them time to deschool and just be.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;It seems they do nothing but video games, computer games or play outside (which doesn&#39;t seem to involve any imagination).&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So they are doing something that&#39;s fun for them. That&#39;s good! Why not get in there and play along with them? Find out what&#39;s so fascinating about the games they&#39;re playing. I&#39;ll bet you find it&#39;s more challenging and imaginative than you think.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;It just seems that our days consists of nothing but chores and video games.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d drop the chores then. &lt;g&gt; Seriously. My best suggestion is to be in their world and play along with them. Let them teach you how to play. Some of my favorite times lately are when my 16 yos and his friend try to teach me to play Halo2. Not because I love the game, but because I love my son.<br/>

&quot;Just today I&#39;m going to be utterly present for my children, I&#39;m going to be in their world (not just doing my own thing while they do theirs), I&#39;m going to really hear them, I&#39;m going to prepare myself to be present starting right now.&quot;<br/>

I totally agree with Mary!!<br/>
7 boys WOW. I have four boys and I admire you for all that you have to  do.<br/>
I have been making the transition from homeschooling to unschooling for  <br/>
almost 2 years and I STILL have a lot of deschooling to do.But one thing I&#39;ve  <br/>
learned is when you take time off and actually spend all day with them on their  <br/>
level that they will astound you on what they have acomplished all on their  <br/>
own...no structure. <br/>
My boys also love playstation and TV and hanging around,but even though it  <br/>
seems impossible they do have their days where they choose other things to do.  <br/>
Usually when I have left them alone about doing something else and let them  <br/>
be.That&#39;s when they choose more creative things to do. I actually have them <br/>
ask  to do workbooks every blue moon. Then they won&#39;t ask again for a couple of  <br/>
months. But it took a long time for me to transition from schoolish paranoia <br/>
to  &quot;enjoy and don&#39;t worry&quot;<br/>
                                                                              <br/>
