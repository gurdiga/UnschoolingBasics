I think about the lyrics it sure seems like the Carpenters were<br/>
unschooly :-D<br/>

We&#39;ve only just begun to live,<br/>
White lace and promises<br/>
A kiss for luck and we&#39;re on our way.<br/>
And yes, We&#39;ve just begun.<br/>
<br/>
Before the rising sun we fly,<br/>
So many roads to choose<br/>
We start our walking and learn to run.<br/>
And yes, We&#39;ve just begun.<br/>
<br/>
Sharing horizons that are new to us,<br/>
Watching the signs along the way,<br/>
Talking it over just the two (or three or five or seven or ten) of us,<br/>
Working together day to day<br/>
Together.<br/>
<br/>
And when the evening comes we smile,<br/>
So much of life ahead<br/>
We&#39;ll find a place where there&#39;s room to grow,<br/>
And yes, We&#39;ve just begun.<br/>
