<div id="ygrps-yiv-372889902">This was my recent reply to a Mom asking for advice about Pokemon....she had receieved advice from another hs Mom to limit it and it was a &quot;waste of time&quot;....this is how I replied.   Thanks to many of you on this list, I feel confident in my replies now and really truly believe that unschooling is the best choice for us.  It&#39;s taken me a while, but I fell like we&#39;re finally there!  (BTW:  This Mom was asking my advice because my kids seem like thoughtful and kind kids, who also happen to be into Pokemon...Imagine!!) <br/>

Hi ....<br/>
Thanks for passing this on and asking for my opinion....it&#39;s always nice to look at things from someone else&#39;s perspective to dig down deep to really analyze what you believe and why.  This also came at a good time because Fran and Will are both really into Pokemon at the moment.  <br/>
My first thought, after reading what the other Mom wrote, was that I think I am coming from a different angle than she is, which is at the core of what I believe.  And it hasn&#39;t always been this way, but has evolved the longer we homeschool.   I really truly feel that there is value and &quot;educational merit&quot; in everything that my kids do. I don&#39;t feel that limiting or banning anything that they feel is important to them does anything good....for our relationship, for their feelings, or for their judgement on how they want to spend their time.  We (kids or adults!) don&#39;t learn from what other people think is important  and I have found, through trial and error and going through periods of trying to control, that trusting my kids is always the best way to go.  <br/>
That being said, there IS a lot of &quot;educational&quot; value in Pokemon that I can list here.  It provides a way to connect with friends and has allowed the kids a safe way to negotiate with others.  There is a lot of math involved and can get very complex if they really play the game with energy cards, etc.  The characters are great and have led to other stroy telling opportunities.  Will has made up his own game (called YOPE), which is a combination of Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh, where he and friends draw their own cards and give them powers.  This has evolved into another game that Fran and Will play with another brother and sister pair their same ages (called Conquer the Monster) where each level they gain another power and pieces the their DNA (very imaginative!) and can do different spells to the monster.  Will and Fran both also have an interest in animals and have noticed that many of the Pokemon cards are exaggerated versions of real animals....Will<br/>
 said that he has started to notice more about real animals&#39; characteristics since Pokemon because of the accentuation given on the cards.  Fran has mentioned that comparing and being able to trade fairly is important to her.  ....And on, and on.  The competition bit has not been an issue with my kids or the kids they play with, maybe because they are used to playing with all different ages and wouldn&#39;t allow unfair advantages....I&#39;m not sure.  But I&#39;ve also learned that I have to be present to really see what&#39;s going on and if I saw this happening, it&#39;s a sign to me that they need more help and guidance.<br/>
Anyhoo....not short, but that&#39;s my take on the whole thing.  I think the REAL difference, though, is the underlying philosophy and not the Pokemon specifically.<br/>
HTH, ......Hope to see you guys again soon!<br/>
Peace, <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s often very hard to get someone to listen to what&#39;s *real* rather <br/>
than what society wants us to believe!<br/>
<br/>
I think you did a wonderful job!<br/>

Thanks...I think I get it...and can now share it freely!!  I&#39;m usually a pretty shy person, but email is so easy.  AND I feel pretty strongly about Unschooling now.  Thanks for putting yourself out there for all of us daily (and Ren, and Joyce, and Pam S. and loads of others).  It has made a huge difference in our lives...<br/>
Peace, <br/>
