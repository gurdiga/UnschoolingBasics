<div id="ygrps-yiv-1831073218">My youngest ds is 6.  And SO much like his dad.  Has anyone out there ever <br/>
known a person that cannot make a decision on anything?  Well, OK, not on <br/>
everything, but yesterdays example was purchasing a toy.  He picked out 2 different <br/>
guys on the same dirtbike, and it took 30 mins and almost sent him into tears <br/>
trying to decide which of the two to get.  I didn&#39;t have the money for both, <br/>
so that was out of the question.  This happens sometimes at the grocery store <br/>
with Lunchables, or other foods he&#39;s picking out for lunch or snacks.  I do my <br/>
best not to put pressure on him, but I just can&#39;t buy the whole store, which <br/>
would totally make him happy not to have to leave anything behind.  <br/>
  How can I help him?  Or can I?  I worry about this due to the fact that my <br/>
dh is the exact same way.  Trying to decide what to get at a restaurant is a <br/>
major ordeal for him (and his ds!).  It really does affect dh&#39;s life not being <br/>
able to decide on what to do or when to do it, and I can tell it is a real <br/>
struggle sometimes.<br/>
thanks all<br/>

<br/>
Can you figure out what the reason is for you dh not being willing to <br/>
make decisions more quickly? Is he afraid of making a mistake? Does he <br/>
not like to give up having options so he delays? Or ???<br/>

Boy, can I relate.  I have a FIL and a DH who are exactly the same way.  In <br/>
fact, my dh just sat here in the kitchen trying to decide what CD to buy and <br/>
where to buy it.  It took over an hour to decide between 2 CD&#39;s and 2 stores.  <br/>
(Various Artists type CD with one particular song on he wanted).  I&#39;d have been <br/>
there and back by now.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, after &quot;deciding&quot; he left and came back 25 minutes later empty <br/>
handed.  Couldn&#39;t decide after he got there, got himself in a funk about it, so just <br/>
left and is now upstairs trying to forget about it in front of the TV, I <br/>
imagine.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, it seems to have skipped a generation in my children because I <br/>
don&#39;t think there is anything you can honestly do.  These guys seemed to be <br/>
wired this way and after nearly 20 years I have not figured out a way around <br/>
this.  For a little guy, I might ask if he&#39;d rather me decide for him, since it is <br/>
sooooo very hard.  It might take some of the pressure off him if he said yes! <br/>
 Just a thought.<br/>
<br/>
But I can commiserate - it is absolutely painful having to witness this <br/>
indecision.  And to Pam - it could be any and all of those things you mention.  I <br/>
think mostly it is fear of making the wrong decision, so they just don&#39;t make <br/>
any.<br/>

on anything?  <br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
Oh yes!  My youngest two could never make decisions!  This was hard <br/>
because I had three older kids who never had a problem with <br/>
decisions.  The way I handled it was to break down each choice for <br/>
them so the decision contained less choices.  If we went to <br/>
McDonalds, for example, I knew they wanted fries and a drink, so the <br/>
big choice was what meat they wanted.  I would ask, &quot;do you want <br/>
chicken, hamburg or fish?&quot;.  Then it was, &quot;do you want the sandwich <br/>
or in nugget form&quot;, then &quot;do you want soda or a milk shake&quot;.  It was <br/>
harder in a candy store, though, because there were more choices.  <br/>
The funniest thing was about a month ago, I mentioned this to my <br/>
daughter and she said she thought I asked like that because I <br/>
couldn&#39;t make a decision--lol. <br/>
<br/>
I would think that the way you could break your son&#39;s choice of two <br/>
toys down would be to talk about the different features.  If the only <br/>
difference is color, then only focus on that.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1342395419">I have to agree, a fear of making the wrong decision.  Poor guys.  I asked if <br/>
he&#39;d like me to pick it  out, NO, we hid them behind brothers back and said <br/>
pick one, NO!  So it took forever and a day, at least 30 mins, but he got one.  <br/>
Guess we&#39;ll just go on the way we are and I do remember telling my husband <br/>
onetime that whatever he decided on something it was going to be the right <br/>
decision.  I&#39;ll try that with Isaiah!<br/>
thanks<br/>
