<br/>
My family are wanting to re-locate and take an adventure across the states to a new home.  ;o)  Hi Jill!  We took a trip to Colorado and met some great unschoolers.  Still considering CO. BUT my mom just decided this year to move to Oregon to her sisters.  BUMMER!  I did live there for a year or so as a young child and do remember its beauty.  Just starting to look into outside of Portland/Eugene area now. I hear so many great things about Oregon becoming more Green every day and how much it is a more healthy state. Not to mention the great perks of mountains and ocean!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you ~ Angela</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-798607260">Hi Angela!<br/>
Having lived in Oregon for my first 50 years (yes, half a century!)<br/>
I feel that I am capable of giving some input here.<br/>
 <br/>
Oregon is gorgeous.<br/>
It is liberal in most of their views, a diversity of churches, beliefs, religions,<br/>
cultures......<br/>
There is a Starbucks on every other street corner.<br/>
The beach and the mountains are less than 2 hrs away from virtually any location in Oregon.<br/>
Most people are friendly.....<br/>
some are not.<br/>
The sun really shines about 12 days out of the year.<br/>
There is very little or no smog.<br/>
Temps rarely get above 80 degrees,<br/>
and that is only for about 2 wks out of the year.<br/>
It rains about 1 day out of 5....pretty much year round.<br/>
There is usually enough snow in the winter to make things pretty,<br/>
but one can still get around and drive in it.<br/>
Of course there is the occasional ice storms,<br/>
probably 1 every few years,<br/>
where everything stands still....<br/>
including MAX (public transportation).<br/>
 <br/>
From what I hear, Oregon is pretty homeschool friendly.<br/>
I had friends who were homeschooling when I lived there who never<br/>
ran into problems.<br/>
I didn&#39;t homeschool til I moved to VA and TN.<br/>
 <br/>
So that about sums it up in a &quot;nutshell&quot; I guess.<br/>
I tried to be impartial.<br/>
Personally, the gray skies and rain were too much for me.<br/>
But some people love it!<br/>
And have webbed feet and slugs for pets! LOL<br/>
Just kidding.<br/>
 <br/>
Best wishes.<br/>
 <br/>

My best friend lives in Oregon and she sent me this link the other day.<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.villagehome.org/video.phpShe">http://www.villagehome.org/video.phpShe</a> is concerned about some of the laws there.  Here in Louisiana I have the right to apply for private school status and avoid interference.  But on the other hand, my family has no &quot;groups.&quot;  We are excluded from every homeschooling group in my area because I am not  a Christian, and the more specific &quot;unschooling&quot; group in my area more specifically excludes us because we are not Catholic.  I personally would much rather deal with the state and have my children involved with something like Village Home.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1229689037">Hi,<br/>
We recently (11 months ago) moved to Portland from Jackson, WY (16 years there) and are LOVING it here...we have 2 always unschooled daughters (3.5 and 6) and love the big unschooling community here, as well as all of the things to do -- science center (OMSI), zoo, children&#39;s museum, theaters, art museums, etc etc etc...There are tons of parks (and several park days each week with unschoolers), and plenty of opportunities to get outside in nature in 1/2 hour or less. Of course, more &quot;wild&quot; nature is also accessible  within a 2 hour drive (coast, mountains).<br/>
<br/>
Having moved from a really sunny (and COLD/SNOWY) place, I was worried we would really miss the sun...but have found that the sun shines at least a little almost every day...many days start out hazy and grey, but then have sun interspersed...I found it to be quite nice (but of course, have been told my many long time Oregonians I&#39;m in the &quot;honeymoon&quot; period), but, so far, so good...the other reason I think the weather didn&#39;t bother me so much is that there&#39;s plenty of stuff to do, even if it&#39;s raining!  :)<br/>
<br/>
We also considered Eugene, and on &quot;paper&quot; it seemed like the perfect fit for us -- we were worried that Portland would be too big and impersonal, but we are finding it to be more like a &quot;big town&quot; than a huge city...lots of friendly people, we see familiar faces most places we go, so that makes it seem smaller.  We spent two days in Eugene about 2 years ago when we were making our decision (granted that&#39;s not a lot of time, but...)and it seemed to be a city more based around the university...(again, this could have just been our impressions since we were there for such a short time) but we&#39;ve found we love the diversity in Portland.<br/>
<br/>
Gotta go, but feel free to email me off list if you want more info...<br/>
