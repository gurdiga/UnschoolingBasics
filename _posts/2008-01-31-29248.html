<div id="ygrps-yiv-607809321">Hi! My name is Nadine. I&#39;m unschooling my 2 boys, Ben, 5 and Jeff 21 months. We decided to homeschool when ben was a baby, and naturally fell into unschooling. We live in Louisiana, and are fortunate to be part of a large, supportive homeschooling community. We hae a few unschooling friends, so never feel odd about our choices.<br/>
  I am pleased to have found this group. It is alwasys nice to have the support of other in a similar situation. <br/>
