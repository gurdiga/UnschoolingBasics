I feel I&#39;ve failed her, really she never deschooled I guess . . . the thought of handing her over tomorrow makes me shutter and feel so sad.  I&#39;ve talked with her about how I feel about compulsory school -- she really wants to go.  Any thoughts anyone has I&#39;d appreciate.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1163902196">An acquaintance of ours relocated with a teenager (I think he was <br/>
already a teen when they moved) and he decided to go to high school in <br/>
their new town. She would sometimes tell hysterically funny stories of <br/>
what he related about his days there because she said it sounded like <br/>
an anthropologist discussing some fascinating odd other culture. Just <br/>
knowing there IS an alternative and that you DO have a choice is HUGE <br/>
in changing the situation. You can play the game KNOWING it is a game, <br/>
it isn&#39;t all of life.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-908397572">Hi Ann,<br/>
<br/>
We have been unschooling 2 of our kids for 4 years, but my oldest <br/>
decided to go to school not long after we started unschooling. He is <br/>
a senior in high school now. We had been homeschooling for 4 years <br/>
before unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
One advantage that homeschoolers/unschoolers have is that they <br/>
generally have better communication with their kids. Make sure that <br/>
you remember to talk to your daughter about her choice to go to <br/>
school with an open mind. Just like with anything else in life, you <br/>
have to trust that she knows what she needs. My son just had a need <br/>
to go to school. We talked much about some of the things that go on <br/>
at schools that has nothing to do with school or learning. We talked <br/>
about the possibility that if it didn&#39;t work out, that he could come <br/>
home at any time. He has accused me at times of trying to talk him <br/>
into coming home, so I try to be careful not to sound like I am.<br/>
<br/>
Michael thought that he would be behind his classmates (one reason <br/>
he wanted to go to school, not our idea, his), but he found that he <br/>
was way ahead of them in many areas. The only thing he had trouble <br/>
with was note taking and writing in general. I knew getting good <br/>
grades would be extremely important to him, so we have talked about <br/>
that alot. His grades do not matter to me and I&#39;ve told him so. What <br/>
does matter is that he gets what he needs from his school <br/>
experience. It does make a big difference that he chose to go to <br/>
school compared to the other kids that have been there doing it all <br/>
of their life. We talk often. He is not as open with me as he used <br/>
to be but it is really his way of separating from his mother so he <br/>
can grow up. When he is ready to talk about something, he knows I am <br/>
there with an uncritical eye and ear.<br/>
<br/>
For the first couple of years there were some things that came up <br/>
that you do have to watch out for when you have such extremes in one <br/>
household. Our other two boys got so used to hanging out together <br/>
that Michael began to feel kind of separated from the rest of us. It <br/>
was one of those things that you don&#39;t realize that it is happening. <br/>
I think this was part of Michaels growing up experience also. He <br/>
needed some space to find out just who he was. We did finally see <br/>
what was going on and we try to make sure now that Michael has the <br/>
opportunity to be involved in what his brothers do during the day <br/>
and of course they share many friends together, most of which are <br/>
homeschoolers/unschoolers, but they make Michael feel right at home.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if this helps any or not. It was hard for me to let <br/>
Michael go to school, knowing that he didn&#39;t have to. He has had <br/>
some tough times with classes he didn&#39;t like so well or even in <br/>
classes that he loves but he feels that what the teacher asks him to <br/>
do is pointless! But, he has stuck to it because that is what he <br/>
wants to do. He has managed to keep his grades at 3.0 or above <br/>
because he wants to get a scholarship. (We have bright futures in <br/>
FL, 3.0 will earn 75% paid scholarship!) He&#39;s gotten a part-time job <br/>
in the field that he loves (computers). Our communication is still <br/>
good and he is a happy camper.<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion is to be open and honest to your daughter about how <br/>
you feel about her going to school without making her feel guilty or <br/>
that you are pressuring her to change her decision. If she chooses <br/>
to stay in school, she will remember your openness and honesty and <br/>
will do the same with you. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-77165125">Thank you, yes, the choice issue IS huge . . . and the game part.  I think my daughter already treats it like a game and when she went to school before she did, too.   I realize I may be projecting my own strong attachments/resistances with school onto her . . <br/>
again, thank you.</div>

 <br/>
I&#39;m guessing it will suck.<br/>
 <br/>
But if you make *your* days at home really too interesting, you may find she&#39;d rather spend more days with y&#39;all than at school.<br/>
 <br/>
And if she knows she can come home at any time,....<br/>
