<div id="ygrps-yiv-8930396">I saw this tonight and immediately thought about our past discussions<br/>
here as to whether or not forbiding and limiting foods made children<br/>
want them more, or helped children to make wise decisions.<br/>
<br/>
After seeing this documentary I have to say, we aren&#39;t limiting  foods<br/>
anymore. :)<br/>
