<div id="ygrps-yiv-494015104">I&#39;m in the early stages of presenting the idea of unschooling to my hubby.<br/>
He&#39;s very conditioned into believing that the traditional method of<br/>
schooling is necessary for our boys.  He&#39;s okay with homeschooling (after a<br/>
great deal of discussion), but unschooling is very &quot;out there&quot; for him.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to think of ideas to share with him that will assist him in<br/>
shifting his thinking.  One thing I thought of yesterday was traits that<br/>
adults need to be successful.  I don&#39;t necessarily mean money and<br/>
possessions (although my hubby is thinking along those lines still), but<br/>
happiness, holding a job that provides you with an independent free life,<br/>
etc.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know of any articles from more mainstream publications or<br/>
websites that talk about this and include traits like; self learning, self<br/>
motivated, free thinker, creative thinker, etc.?  I know that *I* believe<br/>
unschooling will promote those traits and that they are necessary for true<br/>
all-around &quot;success&quot; in adulthood, but having my hubby read it in a more<br/>
traditional publication might be a helpful step for him.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Any other ideas would be appreciate as well. :-)<br/>

Daniel Pink is a business writer that talks about these traits (that he  also <br/>
sees in homeschoolers) in Free Agent Nation.  He has a new book about  <br/>
right-brained thinkers (creative types).  I don&#39;t know if any info is  available on <br/>
his website, but it is _www.danpink.com_ (http://www.danpink.com) <br/>
 <br/>
I have never actually read his work, just about it.  I think it  might be <br/>
helpful.<br/>
 <br/>
Alfie Kohn does some writing about business also,  but I don&#39;t know if  any <br/>
of it relates to what you are looking for.  I know there are a lot of  articles <br/>
online at his site _www.alfiekohn.com_ (http://www.alfiekohn.com) .<br/>
 <br/>
Have fun!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1909410964">Maybe look into recent books on the &quot;creative class&quot; by Richard<br/>
Florida. I have actually only started reading about - but I think it<br/>
might be able to help you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-638253563">Article from Business Week about the benefits of homeschooling for the<br/>
new economy. Might be the kind of thing you can use in your sell to<br/>
your husband. You might have to register to access the article - but<br/>
it is painless.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-90079412">I had the pleasure of hearing Daniel Pink speak at a homeschool conference here in Maryland a few years back.  He was great.  I&#39;ve been reading his book Free Agent Nation and it is a great book to read. <br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to give a 2nd opinion to his research and opinions. <br/>

&quot;Don&#39;t be afraid of showing affection. Be warm and tender, thoughtful and affectionate. Mankind is more helped by sympathy than by service. Love is more than money, and a kind word will give more pleasure than a present.&quot; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1890385391">Here&#39;s a book your dh might like..<br/>

_24/102-7211170-4125722?%5Fencoding=UTF8&s=books&gt; If You Want to Be Rich &<br/>
Happy: Don&#39;t Go to School? : Ensuring Lifetime Security for Yourself and<br/>
Your Children&quot; by Robert T. Kiyosaki <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It has nothing about homeschooling in it.  But the author does talk a bit<br/>
about the problems of public education and how kids are not taught anything<br/>
about working for themselves.  Robert Kiyosaki&#39;s father was the<br/>
superintendent of schools for the state of Hawaii, so he&#39;s got the<br/>
administration angle of it as well.  This is the book that inadvertently<br/>
started us on the unschooling path.  My dh was reading it & discussing it<br/>
with me - he was concerned that the book points out the problems with school<br/>
but doesn&#39;t tell you what to DO about it.  So I mentioned that some folks<br/>
homeschool for that very reason.  And dh said &quot;well, we should do that.&quot;<br/>
Aaakk!  I meant OTHER people homeschool.  Not ME!  I couldn&#39;t homeschool -<br/>
I&#39;m not organized enough LOL  (I&#39;m not big on cooking or cleaning either.<br/>
Although I can dance!)  Of course, I was thinking homeschooling meant<br/>
school-at-home.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Luckily for us, we lived in the Dallas  area & ended up at the Rethinking<br/>
Education conference about 2 weeks later.  I went, although I was pretty<br/>
sure I would never be convinced to homeschool my own two children  I hadn&#39;t<br/>
even heard of unschooling & didn&#39;t know that was what I was attending.  My<br/>
dh & I were converted to unschooling that weekend (May 2000) & we&#39;ve never<br/>
looked back.    Although are parents still try to point out to us the error<br/>
of our ways LOL<br/>
