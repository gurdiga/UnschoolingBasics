<div id="ygrps-yiv-205382244">Good morning everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I spoke to ITology last night (they finally returned my multiple calls), and they are now looking into doing a workshop with Minecraft! There is another aspect of it, Minecraft EDU and since that is truly educational, they don&#39;t see a problem or issue with it. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s looking good! They may incorporate it into Cyber Saturdays. CS is a workshop dealing with different aspects of IT. My son goes there and it&#39;s quite informative. <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the link to them. <br/>

Anyway, here&#39;s hoping! :)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-284846263">Sorry this got through, folks - looks like it should have gone to a local list in the US, somewhere, I&#39;m guessing NC from the website.<br/>
