<div id="ygrps-yiv-392181369">I have been working on saying &quot;yes&quot; more often.  Thinking about what <br/>
I say and how I talk to my family.<br/>
<br/>
I think I am too late for DD.  Maybe she is just at that age.  She <br/>
is preverbal and will be 3 next month.  One of her only and favorite <br/>
words is &quot;NOOOO&quot;.  She yells it.  She knows a bit of ASL, but not <br/>
nearly enough.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the time she is yelling at her brother.  He forgets to talk <br/>
to her and just takes things from her and does things to her with <br/>
out talking to her.  Her receptive language is pretty much on <br/>
track.  She just needs a bit more time to process things than some <br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
We had a less than enjoyable nature hike today with her <br/>
shrieking &quot;NOOO&quot; most of the way.  I think she wanted to get out of <br/>
the backpack carrier but it was very cold and muddy.  She isn&#39;t <br/>
walking and she would have ended up soaked and freezing butt <br/>
scooting around.  I have such a hard time balancing activities for <br/>
both kids.  But that is another question.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any ideas, thoughts, suggestions to help us get <br/>
through this.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1933044991">Hi Christy,<br/>
<br/>
I know how you feel. My four year old son is autistic, thus he has some processing issues, hyperactivity and he speaks but doesn&#39;t always have the words to express himself fully. I also have two daughters ages 10 and 12. They have issues of their own but not nearly as many as my son. <br/>
<br/>
I can tell you is it does get better as they get older. As your older one matures she will understand the difficulties of her little sister. As your little grows and progresses she will be able to do more things, cimmunicate more effectively and this will make her less frustrated. Having all of my kids home together has made a big difference in our lives. They are much closer than they would have been if they were in school. <br/>
<br/>
A sibling support group might be helpful for your older daughter if there is one available in your area.  Try to do things seperately with each of your children at least every once in a while. My husband I and I take turns taking the girls to activities that would not be much fun with my son would not enjoy. <br/>
<br/>
Take Care,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1055497873">Um, well, NO is a very important word for a 2yo.  It&#39;s about setting her own limits, owning her space, determining and defending her territory, asserting herself.  No is a very powerful for a little person.  And it&#39;s a very normal stage for some kids.  Even 2yo&#39;s who aren&#39;t told no very often have been known to embrace the power of NO.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Really, it will pass -- it&#39;s not something you&#39;ve caused by saying no.  I&#39;ve found with my three kids that respecting their no is the most important step in hearing it less often.  Once I learned and respected the boundaries established by their use of the word no, then they didn&#39;t need it as much, because we didn&#39;t violate their newfound boundaries.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Sylvia, who now lives in a house with fewer NO&#39;s, but knows not to expect that word will disappear forever!<br/>
