<div id="ygrps-yiv-664463503">I was wondering how you all handle it when husbands/dads aren&#39;t quite <br/>
on the same page as far as unschooling or mindful parenting. I have <br/>
seen a few coments from the ladies here that suggest that this is <br/>
something that you all may deal with at one time or another. <br/>
My husband and I get along very well, most of the time. The only <br/>
issue we seem to have is about the children. He says things to the <br/>
children that are sometimes hurtful (I feel). <br/>
Do you all comment on it at all? Do you all just let it be? <br/>
We have had many discussions and sometimes arguements. Ok, a lot of <br/>
arguements. I seem to go into a protective mode which puts us at <br/>
odds. I am starting to think that maybe I need to relax a little and <br/>
just let it go. It seems to happen most with our 8 year old dd. She <br/>
is a bundle of energy and chatters almost nonstop. This drives him <br/>
nuts. He will sometimes make a nasty comment to her and hurt her <br/>
feelings. I start to worry about her self esteem and how she will <br/>
expected to be treated by the men in her life when she gets older. I <br/>
have been friends with several women who did not have good <br/>
relationships with thier fathers and all of them have chosen bums to <br/>
share thier lives with. Am I over analyzing here? Am I being <br/>
overprotective? Could it be that because of the way I am reacting <br/>
that *I* may be standing in the way of them having a better <br/>
relationship?  <br/>
On the other hand, he grew up in a very abusive and controlling home <br/>
and is doing 100% better than his parents ever did. <br/>
I am so tired of fighting about it (or just not saying anything and <br/>
seething with anger for days) and I&#39;m sure he is too. I dread the <br/>
weekends when he is going to be home. I want to find some sort of <br/>
balance or happy medium here but I can&#39;t seem to get it right.  <br/>
Please respond if you have any insight at all. I would appreciate <br/>
other view points on this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1348353502">Aubrey,  I don&#39;t have any words of advice as I&#39;m in the same boat you <br/>
are.  My husband is a very traditional &quot;dictator&quot; parent and has no <br/>
desire to change.  He expects the house to always be clean, no toys <br/>
strewn about, for the kids to do what he says...immediately, to be <br/>
quiet if he&#39;s watching tv, etc., the list goes on.  I&#39;m so sad about it <br/>
and so resentful.  It feels like I take 1 step forward with mindful <br/>
parenting, he comes home & yells at the kids and we&#39;re two steps back.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been meaning to post to the group about it and I&#39;m glad you did.  <br/>
I know I&#39;m not alone with an uncooperative hubby.  I started a Word doc <br/>
where I&#39;ve cut & pasted tidbits from emails here & info from the <br/>
Joyfully Rejoycing website with the hopes that he&#39;ll read it and see <br/>
where I&#39;m coming from.  I have a hard time articulating what <br/>
unschooling means to me, especially as he can be so harsh and somewhat <br/>
of a bully when we try to talk.  I thought if he read some of the <br/>
wonderful words I&#39;ve read, then he might try to be a more mindful <br/>
parent or at least not get so mad when I&#39;m trying to be that kind of <br/>
parent.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m sure the amazing people on this group will have some advice <br/>
for us.<br/>

<br/>
In the moment, I find it much more helpful to try to redirect <br/>
whatever&#39;s going on - look at the needs of my family members and see <br/>
what I can do to meet some of them. Maybe I can offer to do <br/>
something with one kid or another and take some pressure off George. <br/>
Maybe I can offer cookies or back-rubs or a kiss or a trip to the <br/>
store and shift everyone&#39;s focus a little. <br/>
<br/>
That sort of redirection takes a bit of practice, and a bit of <br/>
mutual understanding that its an attempt to be helpful, not <br/>
critical - but I&#39;ve personally found that the more I&#39;m willing to <br/>
work on making the *situation* better, the more George and the kids <br/>
pick up on that and try to do the same things. So when *I&#39;m* losing <br/>
it, George will suddenly offer to play a game or whatever. <br/>

all the time then, yes! These delicate skills take time to practice <br/>
and refine, after all. Even if he&#39;s trying his hardest to change, <br/>
its going to take time - and it will be harder if you&#39;re jumping <br/>
down his throat every time he&#39;s too tired, stressed, hungry, <br/>
whatever and slips back into some older habits. Better to validate <br/>
his efforts and let him know that his needs and wants and feelings <br/>
are every bit as important to you as the kids.<br/>
<br/>
Its also really important to let go of any kind of attatchment you <br/>
may have as to what kind of dad your dh is and what kind of <br/>
relationship the kids have with him. Not that those things aren&#39;t <br/>
important, but if you have an idea in your head as to how all <br/>
that &quot;looks&quot; that idea is going to stand in the way of seeing and <br/>
supporting the real relationships between your family members. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I have a hard time articulating what <br/>
&gt; unschooling means to me<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d start there, on your own - think about what your principles <br/>
(or &quot;core values&quot; if you prefer) are. Write them down if that&#39;s <br/>
helpful to you, but not necessarily for him. Just to get things <br/>
clear in your own mind. <br/>
<br/>
At the same time, think about (or write down) all the things you <br/>
love about this man, the reasons you decided to marry him and have <br/>
children with him. If those reasons aren&#39;t compatible with your <br/>
principles, that&#39;s something to think about, too. Maybe you need to <br/>
dig deeper into the &quot;core&quot; of your values and find the <br/>
commonalities. <br/>
<br/>
While you&#39;re thinking about your own principles, start looking for <br/>
how he&#39;s trying to express *his* principles and validate that! If he <br/>
values protection, see him protecting and honor that - actually <br/>
express that to him. Let him know you appreciate his efforts without <br/>
trashing his methodology for awhile. That&#39;s important.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; My husband is a very traditional &quot;dictator&quot; parent and has no <br/>
&gt; desire to change.  He expects the house to always be clean, no <br/>
 </span></blockquote>toys <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; strewn about, for the kids to do what he says...immediately, to be <br/>
&gt; quiet if he&#39;s watching tv, etc., the list goes on. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do you have a sense of what *his* principles are? That may be <br/>
something for the two of you to dialog about. In your and his <br/>
principles there is almost certainly some common ground if you only <br/>
go deep enough - really! Once you get all the way down to things <br/>
like love and trust and support, you will have a place to start <br/>
talking about *how* y&#39;all can go about living those values <br/>
yourselves in your every day lives. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;He expects the house to always be clean<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Once you have some common ground, you can look for some mutually <br/>
acceptible solutions. Homeschooling is hard on the home! Have you <br/>
let him know that most homeschooling parents struggle with this <br/>
issue (let alone wacked-out unschoolers who think ketchup looks just <br/>
fine on the windows)? That might help him have a bit of perspective. <br/>
Is it possible to keep one part of the house extra-clean just for <br/>
him? <br/>
<br/>
Depending on how old your kids are (don&#39;t remember, sorry) you may <br/>
be able to involve them a bit in this - dad likes a clean house, <br/>
what can we do to help dad feel good when he comes home? <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;to be quiet if he&#39;s watching tv<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Does he need some time to change gears and &quot;land&quot; after work? That&#39;s <br/>
something y&#39;all may need to work into your routine. Are there other <br/>
ways for him to do that besides watching tv? Or maybe he can have <br/>
a &quot;quiet space&quot; where he goes to watch his favorite shows? This is <br/>
the sort of problem solving that is going to have to come *after* <br/>
you&#39;ve established some common ground wrt principles. If he values <br/>
being the leader of the family (for instance) watching tv in silence <br/>
isn&#39;t necessarily the best way to acheive that. If you can find ways <br/>
to meet his needs *and* support his principles, the tv may well <br/>
become less of an issue. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;for the kids to do what he says...immediately<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is the one where its most important to understand what his <br/>
values are, so you can see how he believes this to be supporting his <br/>
principles. *Why* does he want them to obey immediately? If its an <br/>
issue of respect, for example, look for ways for him to feel <br/>
respected in the family - and that starts with you, mom, helping him <br/>
feel valued and important! <br/>
<br/>
It might help to have an example of a specific incident in the home <br/>
so we can help you pull it apart and understand better what&#39;s going <br/>
on - there are a whole passle of reasons people claim to want <br/>
instant obedience that kind of need different approaches.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest issue in &quot;my dh isn&#39;t on board&quot; situations, is that a <br/>
feeling of &quot;us and them&quot; starts to build. Mom and kids *against* <br/>
dad. That&#39;s detrimental to the family as a whole *and* the <br/>
individual relationships within the family. Its really important to <br/>
help dads (or working moms!) feel like their on the same team as the <br/>
rest of the family - that they&#39;re an Important Part of the team, not <br/>
the guy you send out to stand in the corner of the field bc no-one <br/>
ever hits the ball there, anyway.<br/>

&quot;&quot;This list is for adults who live the radical unschooling and <br/>
peaceful/respectful parenting lifestyle with their children and who <br/>
wish to bring a similarly-peaceful and -respectful feeling to their <br/>
relationship with their partner.<br/>

Our focus is on how the actions and shifting of perspective of just <br/>
one of the adults in the partnership may bring more joy to their own <br/>
lives and, hopefully, bring more joy into the relationship with <br/>
their partner.<br/>
<br/>
We have seen that living an unschooling life brings an amazing <br/>
amount of harmony to our relationships with our children and, to a <br/>
certain extent, that carries over into the whole familial <br/>
relationship. But we want to take that a step further and do for our <br/>
partnerships what we&#39;ve done for our relationships with our <br/>
children.&lt;/&gt; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-337673652">I&#39;m by nature a silence person, which is very hard to come by in our  <br/>
house. I mean, we have seven kids and almost always two or three  <br/>
extras.  Part of it is my personality, part of it was being raised by  <br/>
a single mom with one brother, our house was silent most of the time  <br/>
(ie children aren&#39;t seen OR heard). I spent a long time just ignoring  <br/>
my feelings on all the noise, just because I thought that&#39;s what good  <br/>
moms do, and then I&#39;d snap. Then because of all the stress, I&#39;d  <br/>
completely revert into saying something that wasn&#39;t kind or  <br/>
appropriate (like &quot;Would you just SHUT UP!?&quot;) I wonder if it&#39;s  <br/>
something similar. Dh is similar, but his is mess, he can take the  <br/>
noise, but not the clutter. He is a lot more patient than I am though.<br/>
<br/>
I think someone already suggested stepping back and verifying the  <br/>
situation. Making sure that your feelings aren&#39;t tinting your  <br/>
perception. I have that problem with my dh as well, and when i  <br/>
stepped back I noticed that either my kids didn&#39;t take it personally  <br/>
(ie they knew dh was having a bad day and they chose to ignore it) or  <br/>
they would respond (being unschoolers, just last night Sam (heehee)  <br/>
told DH, &quot;Well, you keep telling me what to do. I can&#39;t do two things  <br/>
at ONCE!&quot; Dh was rueful, apologized and did the second thing himself.<br/>
<br/>
What *I* had to do was accept the fact that my kids are noisy, accept  <br/>
the fact that I sometimes had trouble dealing with it. I worked  <br/>
really hard on being open to the noise, celebrating it as what NORMAL  <br/>
children do. And then I worked on ways for me to have some silence. I  <br/>
practiced really hard on what I could say nicely to get some quiet. I  <br/>
came up with a stock phrase that I used at first because I wanted it  <br/>
to be as easy as possible to be kind &quot;Mom&#39;s really worn, can I have  <br/>
five minutes, then we&#39;ll do x and z?&quot; Now not only can I deal with  <br/>
more noise, but because I know that my kids will respect my need for  <br/>
some quiet when I ask, I can deal with even more.<br/>
<br/>
Dh and I both point out stuff to each other, but never in the heat of  <br/>
the moment. We didn&#39;t beat the horse, either, it was one statement  <br/>
and then breath through letting it go. And when we first started  <br/>
unschooling, never with the kids there because both of our trained  <br/>
responses were &quot;Well, I&#39;M the parent&quot; so I&#39;d let dh see the power of  <br/>
his words, and then when the child was gone (usually me saying let&#39;s  <br/>
go play) then I&#39;d come back and say something like &#39;that was a really  <br/>
hurtful way to say that. I know x was bothering you, what else could  <br/>
we do?&#39; He&#39;d do the same thing for me (although, tbh, I usually  <br/>
resisted more than he did....sigh) It almost always leads to us  <br/>
apologizing and saying it was not appropriate. And the answers were  <br/>
always different. Sometimes *I* need to intervene. Sometimes it meant  <br/>
that he would handle it himself.<br/>
<br/>
For now, keep talking to you hubby outside the moment. And i wonder  <br/>
if you could do something if you KNOW he&#39;s going to lose it. Say your  <br/>
daughter is chattering away and you see his tension rising. Then say  <br/>
it for him...so you can model a dfferent way. Something like &quot;Wow!  <br/>
That sounds so exciting!&quot; if she&#39;s want to just share with anyone,  <br/>
offer &quot;Dad needs a break right now, let&#39;s you and me go talk in the  <br/>
dining room&quot; or if she wants to share with dad, &quot;Dad&#39;s kind of tired  <br/>
from work, can we let him rest for a little bit before we continue  <br/>
the story?&quot; my girls love to draw comic books to remember stuff, so  <br/>
maybe while she&#39;s waiting she could share with you again, draw a  <br/>
picture of what she wanted to say, record it on the camcorder. My  <br/>
kids LOVE to make newscasts for my husband...and it&#39;s a funny family  <br/>
thing now because no matter what the news is about, Rachel does the  <br/>
weather, and Sam&#39;s sporting event always includes a pokemon battle.<br/>
<br/>
The hardest part of dh&#39;s day is the second he walks in the door. He  <br/>
has seven kids (and a wife) on him right away, who&#39;ve missed him and  <br/>
just want to be with him and tell him everything all at the same  <br/>
time. He&#39;s used to working in silence most of the time, or in board  <br/>
meetings where people take turns talking (and sometimes no one wants  <br/>
to talk lol!) So it&#39;s a huge change for him, and just fifteen minutes  <br/>
in his bedroom changing (even if he&#39;s already wearing jeans and a t- <br/>
shirt, it&#39;s a symbolic change and guarantees almost some privacy) and  <br/>
going to the bathroom (which usually consists of him reading a  <br/>
chapter from a new book). This time is just amazing in how it  <br/>
increases his patience.<br/>
<br/>
I know that you are working really hard on mindful parenting, and  <br/>
that&#39;s the number one way to help dh, just to let him know it will  <br/>
work. We&#39;re all works in progress, and I&#39;m sure HE doesn&#39;t like  <br/>
snapping at the kids anymore than you guys do. :-(<br/>

&gt; I was wondering how you all handle it when husbands/dads aren&#39;t quite<br/>
&gt; on the same page as far as unschooling or mindful parenting. I have<br/>
&gt; seen a few coments from the ladies here that suggest that this is<br/>
&gt; something that you all may deal with at one time or another.<br/>
&gt; My husband and I get along very well, most of the time. The only<br/>
&gt; issue we seem to have is about the children. He says things to the<br/>
&gt; children that are sometimes hurtful (I feel).<br/>
&gt; Do you all comment on it at all? Do you all just let it be?<br/>
&gt; We have had many discussions and sometimes arguements. Ok, a lot of<br/>
&gt; arguements. I seem to go into a protective mode which puts us at<br/>
&gt; odds. I am starting to think that maybe I need to relax a little and<br/>
&gt; just let it go. It seems to happen most with our 8 year old dd. She<br/>
&gt; is a bundle of energy and chatters almost nonstop. This drives him<br/>
&gt; nuts. He will sometimes make a nasty comment to her and hurt her<br/>
&gt; feelings. I start to worry about her self esteem and how she will<br/>
&gt; expected to be treated by the men in her life when she gets older. I<br/>
&gt; have been friends with several women who did not have good<br/>
&gt; relationships with thier fathers and all of them have chosen bums to<br/>
&gt; share thier lives with. Am I over analyzing here? Am I being<br/>
&gt; overprotective? Could it be that because of the way I am reacting<br/>
&gt; that *I* may be standing in the way of them having a better<br/>
&gt; relationship?<br/>
&gt; On the other hand, he grew up in a very abusive and controlling home<br/>
&gt; and is doing 100% better than his parents ever did.<br/>
&gt; I am so tired of fighting about it (or just not saying anything and<br/>
&gt; seething with anger for days) and I&#39;m sure he is too. I dread the<br/>
&gt; weekends when he is going to be home. I want to find some sort of<br/>
&gt; balance or happy medium here but I can&#39;t seem to get it right.<br/>
&gt; Please respond if you have any insight at all. I would appreciate<br/>
&gt; other view points on this.<br/>

I&#39;m right there w ya. julian is 5, and dh seems to have higher  <br/>
expectations...or something. we argue, and I hate it and so do the kids. I&#39;m  <br/>
TRYING...but...can&#39;t wait to read the responses. I just wanted you to know that  we are <br/>
struggling in the same way, or similar at least...I feel it will slowly  smooth <br/>
over here...but oh, it&#39;s difficult! Dh won&#39;t consider that he needs to  <br/>
deschool - basically, they terms and words I use are dismissed as silly hippy  <br/>
stuff...yet he also clearly likes a LOT of the situation...Ugh. I don&#39;t want to  <br/>
paint a picture of him being a dark and horrid force in our lives, lol, so I  <br/>
shall stop now ;) And read - and LEARN! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1114914113">This is Wildflower&#39;s husband Patrick.<br/>
 <br/>
When my kids were younger I thought homeschooling was for freaks. And unschooling, well, I didn&#39;t have a clue what that was. But as time went by I came to the idea that this stuff really worked by seeing it work in my kids. My kids blow my mind with how amazing they are.<br/>
 <br/>
I worked full time in an office, so I was only seeing some of what was going on. (Now I work full time from home and see a lot more about how it works full time.)At first I figured, how bad could it screw them up at a young age? I mean, they had been at home up until school age and seemed great to me.  But then when I saw that it was better than not screwing them up, they were smart, well rounded people. <br/>
 <br/>
I gotta say it would have really pissed me off if my wife would have corrected me in front of the kids back then. She did a few times, and it really bent me out of shape. We are different people and handle things differently. But now my kids have just learned that their folks have different personalities. I was more of the kind of guy that laid down rules. Now, I am much more laid back and my wife sometimes gets controlling with the kids. So now I step in and say some of the stuff back to her she use to say to me. Most time we both get a kick out of it.<br/>
 <br/>
I would say just talk about in private, but don&#39;t beat it over the guys head. And your kids, well, they&#39;ll figure out how to deal with him on their own. If you do what you know works with the kids, he&#39;ll probably see that and take a que from you. If not, then let your kids see how you deal with him and they&#39;ll figure it out.<br/>
 <br/>
It seems to me that sitting around steaming about it is a waste of time after a certain point.  Instead, take what&#39;s working with your husband and kids and build on that.<br/>
 <br/>
Good Luck,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-484657692">Meredith,  Thanks for this response.  It really does help put things in <br/>
perspective.  We actually tried to talk last night and one thing I <br/>
realize is that, while the children are a big issue for us, there are <br/>
so many other issues that really prevent our marriage from working.  <br/>
We&#39;ve been married for 17 years and so many of them, I&#39;ve wanted to <br/>
leave.  I realized that again last night why we are so incompatible.  I <br/>
was just 19 when we married and I&#39;m now 37 with so many years of <br/>
growing and changing.  And we seem not to be growing in the same <br/>
direction.  Oh, I don&#39;t know.  We need therapy!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I do appreciate the response and will try your suggestions.<br/>

think it&#39;s made our transitions, thus far, much easier.<br/>

From: momma &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:southernbelle@...">southernbelle@...</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering how you all handle it when husbands/dads aren&#39;t quite<br/>
on the same page as far as unschooling or mindful parenting. I have<br/>
seen a few coments from the ladies here that suggest that this is<br/>
something that you all may deal with at one time or another.<br/>
My husband and I get along very well, most of the time. The only<br/>
issue we seem to have is about the children. He says things to the<br/>
children that are sometimes hurtful (I feel).<br/>
Do you all comment on it at all? Do you all just let it be?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Depends on the situation.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve done it all from screaming like a banshee to letting him &quot;work it <br/>
through&quot; to discussing it afterwards to discussing it at the time to <br/>
telling him I will walk and take the kids with me to <br/>
...well...everything!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We have had many discussions and sometimes arguements. Ok, a lot of<br/>
arguements. I seem to go into a protective mode which puts us at<br/>
odds. I am starting to think that maybe I need to relax a little and<br/>
just let it go. It seems to happen most with our 8 year old dd. She<br/>
is a bundle of energy and chatters almost nonstop. This drives him<br/>
nuts. He will sometimes make a nasty comment to her and hurt her<br/>
feelings.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also make very nasty comments to him about his nasty comments and <br/>
hurt him very much.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, it was after he understood that it&#39;s not about *him*---it&#39;s <br/>
about the *children*!<br/>
<br/>
We talk a lot obout healing ourselves by being the parent we wish that <br/>
we had had. I try to use my own examples with my own parents. Then Ben <br/>
started to give me some of his own examples. We talked about how our <br/>
parents made us feel. AFter a while, I could just give him a &quot;look&quot; <br/>
that would stop him from going off any further.<br/>
<br/>
Now he does that for *me* sometimes! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I start to worry about her self esteem and how she will<br/>
expected to be treated by the men in her life when she gets older. I<br/>
have been friends with several women who did not have good<br/>
relationships with thier fathers and all of them have chosen bums to<br/>
share thier lives with. Am I over analyzing here? Am I being<br/>
overprotective? Could it be that because of the way I am reacting<br/>
that *I* may be standing in the way of them having a better<br/>
relationship?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe.<br/>
<br/>
But who else will stand up for your child?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, he grew up in a very abusive and controlling home<br/>
and is doing 100% better than his parents ever did.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a really common excuse for not getting any *better*.<br/>
<br/>
Sure, he&#39;s a better parent than his parents, but does that mean he <br/>
can/should stop trying to be a BETTER parent than he is now?<br/>
<br/>
I talk with my kids about my childhood and how I had to dump a lot of <br/>
bad modelling that was done for/to me. I&#39;m hoping that they will have <br/>
*less* baggage. And that their children will have even LESS!<br/>
<br/>
The other day, we were at a store where a dad was being very <br/>
controlling and mean to his son. Duncan waked out and said about the <br/>
little boy, &quot;He&#39;ll have a lot of baggage to dump if he&#39;s going to be a <br/>
good dad.&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But we talk about it a lot---Ben and I, the boys and I, Ben and the <br/>
boys---we all discuss how we can be better and do better.<br/>
<br/>
When we are stressed or tired or out of sorts, it&#39;s common---and <br/>
easy!---to revert to what we were modelled as children. Before we open <br/>
our mouths, if we can think for *just a moment* (which is really hard <br/>
when we&#39;re not 100% there) whether that is how our children want to <br/>
remember us, maybe we can make a better choice. Making it just a <br/>
*little* better *each* time will bring us to being pretty damn close to <br/>
the ideal after a while!<br/>
<br/>
-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
I am so tired of fighting about it (or just not saying anything and<br/>
seething with anger for days) and I&#39;m sure he is too. I dread the<br/>
weekends when he is going to be home. I want to find some sort of<br/>
balance or happy medium here but I can&#39;t seem to get it right.<br/>
Please respond if you have any insight at all. I would appreciate<br/>
other view points on this.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Ask him whether he would like to be a better dad and husband. If he <br/>
says no, there&#39;s not much you can do.<br/>
<br/>
If he says yes!, well... you can both talk about how to do that. How <br/>
would *he* like you to help him?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-341768879">I wish my husband were on the same page as me. He allows me to homeschool,  <br/>
but doesn&#39;t know that I unschool. There&#39;s always enough progress for him to be  <br/>
happy. He is not involved in the schooling process, so it hasn&#39;t been an <br/>
issue  yet. He does feel that children should fear their parents, which has led to <br/>
 arguments. His anger used to be an issue but it has improved a lot. We&#39;re  <br/>
getting more and more on the same page when it comes to parenting.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-621333068">Hello! I am enjoying all the posts and discussions-- all of you are helping me allay my unschooling fears. That said, I just had to giggle that (schooled) husband after (schooled) husband (mine included) hates reading so much that he/they won&#39;t take a few minutes to read about unschooling. I am beginning to find that quite funny and ironic.  ;-) Jennifer</div>
