<div id="ygrps-yiv-1642836903">Simon isn&#39;t reading yet. He&#39;s 9. I&#39;ve had friends of his ask me why he isn&#39;t <br/>
reading and I just say its a code he hasn&#39;t broken yet. But, because they <br/>
know him, it isn&#39;t in the face of being asked if he&#39;s stupid. His sister, <br/>
Linnaea, who is 6 is reading. And when she first read a book I was worried <br/>
that Simon would feel stupid. And I asked him if it bothered him and he said <br/>
&quot;I&#39;m better at other things that Linnaea isn&#39;t so good at. Reading is just <br/>
something she figured out before me.&quot; And that kind of self-esteem, gosh, I <br/>
can&#39;t even imagine that some stranger would shake it. Your son sounds like <br/>
he has the same great sense of self. I wouldn&#39;t worry about him needing <br/>
something snappy to say. I think he handled the situation with incredible <br/>
aplomb and grace.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1898847983">my kids love to draw and i try to keep all the materials they need very <br/>
accessable cause they draw, cut, glue, and tape at all our of the day and <br/>
night. they spread this stuff everywhere but i think it is important for <br/>
them to be able to get to it.  besides if i tried to put it up they would <br/>
find the stuff, they are very good at using chairs to reach things.  One <br/>
thing that is bothering me though is my almost 4 year old thinks he should <br/>
be able to draw on anything.  I find his name and other letters, skulls and <br/>
crossbones, ships, rockets on the walls, the furniture, the floor.  I never <br/>
see him doing this, just walk in the kitchen to get something and come back <br/>
and there it is.  He is very proud of his drawings and claims them <br/>
everytime.  My dh gets angry so i try to keep it cleaned up but some of it <br/>
wont clean off some surfaces and like he gouged marks with a pen in our <br/>
dresser.  Dh actually threatened to spank him last time he drew on my moms <br/>
walls (he has never spanked him and wouldnt either but he was mad <br/>
obviously).  I think dh thinks it is my fault cause i just talk to him about <br/>
it.  And point him toward paper.  Our house is a mess cause I cant keep up <br/>
with them (and i dont make house keeping a priority) and dh is kind of <br/>
embarressed about the house at times and this adds to its overall look.  We <br/>
dont have to many nice things but the few we do are written on.  Anyway, any <br/>
ideas.  I talked to him today about it cause he had drawn all over the t.v. <br/>
cabinet.  Is a few weeks from 4 to young to expect this kind of impulse <br/>
control?<br/>

<br/>
HUGE PIECES OF BUTCHER PAPER all over the walls and  furniture. Taped up so <br/>
that almost every surface is paper. Then you reward  with big hugs and kisses <br/>
when he draws on the paper. Try to stay  calm while showing him you aren&#39;t too <br/>
excited about any future  drawings on furniture or walls, but of course it is <br/>
normal, LOL. Then you  can start making the surfaces with the paper smaller, <br/>
less paper, more  walls, kind of like training the puppy to pee on the <br/>
newspaper? Please  remind your husband that this is only now, it gets better and it <br/>
lasts  such a short time. Also tell him that this &quot;drawing all over everything&quot;  <br/>
will be such a funny story to tell when you are being interviewed  because <br/>
your son is 30 and has his art displayed in museums. You  really TRULY never <br/>
know with kids. What if he becomes a famous artist who  specifically draws on <br/>
furniture and sells his pieces all over the world?  It would be sad to stifle <br/>
that. Hope the paper thing works. It is all I  could think of!!!!!!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1304130452">I don&#39;t think it&#39;s too young in some ways and it is in other ways (how&#39;s<br/>
that for a non-answer lol). What is it he gets out of it? <br/>
 <br/>
For instance, painted walls or wallpaper have different textures, the<br/>
writing looks different there. If that&#39;s related, maybe get some<br/>
inexpensive (free) wallpaper samples or sections of board you can paint<br/>
and hang as &quot;art areas&quot; in various places. Paint over it (primer<br/>
necessary) whenever it starts getting crowded - maybe take a digital<br/>
photo of it first. <br/>
 <br/>
Maybe it&#39;s just handy when he has an idea right at the moment and &quot;can&#39;t<br/>
wait&quot; to find paper to sketch it out. If that&#39;s the case, maybe creating<br/>
safe to draw on areas in each room - using chalkboard paint for instance<br/>
or putting up whiteboards or wallpapering a section with a sheet of the<br/>
brown butcher paper stuff (we have several rolls, it comes in packs of 4<br/>
or 6 rolls at Sam&#39;s Club and other places).<br/>
 <br/>
Also, put any permanent inks up or remove them from the house and leave<br/>
more readily washable writing implements at hand for a while.<br/>
 <br/>
Back long ago when I was in college, they were coming through to repaint<br/>
the dorm hallways and public areas. Since they had to prime it anyhow,<br/>
they gave us notice as to when they would be by for that and said Go<br/>
ahead and write on the walls if you want, the primer will cover it. So<br/>
we did - we got pens and markers and made a huge mural all down the<br/>
walls. Then they came and painted over it. It was really fun - and I was<br/>
19 at the time!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Butcher paper or newsprint!!  Butcher paper is nice in that it is<br/>
white and easily stored and has a waxy back so marker doesn&#39;t bleed<br/>
through to the back.  Newsprint is cheap as most newspaper offices<br/>
will give or sell it cheaply (I think our newspaper sells end rolls<br/>
for $3-$5 and there is still quite a bit of paper left on the roll).<br/>
Tape it to your walls.  Let him go to town!  My kids love wall art<br/>
because it is big and wide and they aren&#39;t limited by an 8.5 x 11<br/>
sheet of paper.  It also is easy to clean up.   Another idea is to<br/>
paint a wall or section of a wall with chalkboard paint and get him a<br/>
big box of colored chalk.  Again this is giving him a place to create<br/>
that is for him.  If you own your own house consider painting his room<br/>
(or the hall or another wall that you are willing to give him) with a<br/>
semi-gloss or gloss paint and just resolve to the fact that when you<br/>
move or he moves out of this stage you will just paint the wall, but<br/>
being gloss has a better ability for cleaning if need be before then<br/>
(those magic erasers will take off almost anything from the walls!)<br/>
<br/>
My dream has always been to have a &quot;quotes wall&quot;  Grafitti in the<br/>
house.  A plain colored walls that friends and family and guests can<br/>
write quotes on.  Big, small, fancy, in their own handwriting or<br/>
fonted.  Quotes on paper could be glued on or mearly tacked or taped.<br/>
Marker, paint, crayon, I don&#39;t care the medium.  I&quot;m a tad older than<br/>
your son and I still want to write on the walls :)<br/>

 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>A friend&#39;s daughter did that (with their okay). Whenever she read a<br/>
Bible passage or saw a quote from someone that touched or inspired her,<br/>
she&#39;d write it down somewhere on the walls or framing (around the<br/>
windows and door). This was over years and years, from probably around<br/>
10 or 11 years old on up until quite recently (she&#39;s in her early 20s<br/>
now I think). Over time, it became a visual reminder of her growing up<br/>
and becoming who she is now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1061018814">Thanks for the ideas.  I will try the tacking some paper to the walls.  The <br/>
other thing I keep thinking as I type with a monitor with a blue magic <br/>
marker mark across it is 1) I need to keep a better eye on him and 2) he <br/>
draws on whatever is there when he gets the impulse to draw.  So maybe paper <br/>
available all over the house instead of in two places not near where he gets <br/>
the impulse.  He is a sweet little boy and he loves to see what will happen. <br/>
  He will dissappear in the bathroom with a smile and I will follow him <br/>
asking what he is up to.  &quot;just a speramint Mama&quot; as he unravels all the <br/>
toilet paper and puts it in the sink or fills up the sink with water and <br/>
dunks his toys in it.  I am afraid to think of all the things he has <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1904550743">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Riley&#39;s feelings were hurt by the insult. He&#39;s venturing out more into the mainstream world too, around more people who don&#39;t get trust and self learning. He&#39;ll be flying down to San Diego next month, off to New mexico next summer. I see more and more raised eyebrows the older he is and he&#39;s a guy who feels hurts very deeply, that&#39;s why I&#39;m wondering what others with later readers have experienced.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1688364382">I had a friend who really loved graffiti with spray cans. His mom,<br/>
hung up giant sheets all over his bedroom and he just went to town. It<br/>
was the coolest thing ever! I think the paper hanging up all over the<br/>
house is an awesome idea :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-208188425">we actually have a door to our basement where we do this.  It had the growth <br/>
marks of two generations of kids that grew up in this house prior to our <br/>
moving in.  We didnt have the heart to paint over it so we just added our <br/>
kids.  It is kind of fun to mark the kids height on it and measure then in <br/>
comparison to the kids we dont know.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the ideas.  I will look at his art as him expressing <br/>
himself.. and will try to convince his Dad to too.  The wall and door jams <br/>
all need to be painted anyway.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-59630182">Something just occurred to me - can you get some scrap wood somewhere? <br/>
A crafty neighbor, maybe. I was thinking of your guy gouging your <br/>
dresser and I could just *feel* that in my hands - the satisfaction of <br/>
the pen sinking into the wood. Ahhhhh. Or maybe wander around a craft <br/>
shop looking at everything as a possible writing surface. <br/>
<br/>
Another &quot;surface&quot; to consider is glass - windows and mirrors. Water-<br/>
based markers come right off (Crayola markers write the best) and <br/>
tempera paints produce a lovely stained-glass look.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1342724018">Oh and don&#39;t forget the bathtub crayons so he can scrawl all over the<br/>
bathroom tiles and it washes right off (well, mostly anyhow, I think<br/>
there&#39;s still a tiny shadow of green in one area where it didn&#39;t get<br/>
washed off for several days).<br/>
 <br/>
Also, any Crayola product will have information on their website as to<br/>
how to remove it from various surfaces. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1176999206">Our twin boys, age 3, have chalkboard paint on their wall. 3 green <br/>
walls one black.  They LOVE it as do our older 3 sons.  Fortunatly <br/>
I&#39;ve discovered the &quot;Magic Eraser&quot; cleaning sponge because they now<br/>
enjoy writing on our diningroom walls as well.  :-) <br/>
<br/>
The chalkboard paint works like a charm for those who are wondering. <br/>

&gt; Butcher paper or newsprint!!  Butcher paper is nice in that it is<br/>
&gt; white and easily stored and has a waxy back so marker doesn&#39;t bleed<br/>
&gt; through to the back.  Newsprint is cheap as most newspaper offices<br/>
&gt; will give or sell it cheaply (I think our newspaper sells end rolls<br/>
&gt; for $3-$5 and there is still quite a bit of paper left on the roll).<br/>
&gt; Tape it to your walls.  Let him go to town!  My kids love wall art<br/>
&gt; because it is big and wide and they aren&#39;t limited by an 8.5 x 11<br/>
&gt; sheet of paper.  It also is easy to clean up.   Another idea is to<br/>
&gt; paint a wall or section of a wall with chalkboard paint and get him <br/>

&gt; (those magic erasers will take off almost anything from the walls!)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My dream has always been to have a &quot;quotes wall&quot;  Grafitti in the<br/>
&gt; house.  A plain colored walls that friends and family and guests can<br/>
&gt; write quotes on.  Big, small, fancy, in their own handwriting or<br/>
