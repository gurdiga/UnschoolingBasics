I DO  have to give up my &quot;ideal&quot; <br/>

my idea of a  mini-farm.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
See I would not look at it as I had to &quot;give up my mini-farm&quot;  that  sounds <br/>
so final and negative and would, for me, stop the flow of ideas.  I  would say <br/>
that in the end my desire to have happy children and dh was my  preference, <br/>
what I really wanted and needed and then I would also look at  creating my own <br/>
&quot;mini-farm&quot; right where I was, not just &quot;giving it up&quot;.  I  have done the same <br/>
thing.  I have my own mini-farm right here, and it has  fulfilled my need to <br/>
have &quot;critters&quot; around, without anyone having to &quot;give up&quot;  anything.  What I <br/>
really wanted was not &quot;a farm&quot; what I really wanted was  to feel closer to the <br/>
earth and animals, have that feeling of providing some  food for my family.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
It may sound like just playing with words but it has the power to open up  <br/>
ideas rather than shut them down.<br/>

Pat: <br/>
We would explore what it is about the front seat that is attractive,<br/>
or what is aversive about the alternate seats. Perhaps, someone gets<br/>
car sick riding in the back. I know I do. Perhaps, someone is getting<br/>
too much sunlight, too much cool air, not enough air circulation, too<br/>
crowded by others, too much noise of others in the back, control of<br/>
the music dial, chatting with mama, interest in observing driving<br/>
skills, desire to &quot;co-pilot&quot;, too much elbowing or encroaching into<br/>
their space, the seatbelt rubs uncomfortably, too bumpy, too swerving,<br/>
someone can&#39;t see out, seat rides too low, someone is riding<br/>
backwards, wants to read while riding and doesn&#39;t have enough light,<br/>
etc??? There are many possible underlying needs that can be solved for<br/>
which don&#39;t include the original solution: everyone sitting in the<br/>
front seat. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ren: <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Yes, we work it out until we come to a mutually agreeable solution,<br/>

compromise.<br/>
<br/>
Is not going an option, is there another alternative means of<br/>
traveling, is it necessary to all go together, is the issue really the<br/>
car seat, is there a desire to be the &quot;special&quot; front seat rider, is<br/>
there something about the conflict that engages another for attention:<br/>
sibling or parent, delay? What is the underlying need? The front seat<br/>
has what attractive qualities? How can those be replicated? The back<br/>
seat has what unattractive qualities? How can those be eliminated?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t see how giving up something you initially wanted is a bad thing.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess it depends on if one wants to give &quot;it&quot; up, or not. I can&#39;t<br/>
determine that another person &#39;give up something&#39;, without sometype of<br/>
compulsion, unless they are in agreement. Compulsion can exist in many<br/>
ways: coercion, guilt, force, threats, bribes, etc. It is easier to<br/>
create a preferable solution, than convince someone to give something<br/>
up, ime. So, we spend our energy there.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I like to have fresh eggs from local, free range chickens. So, we buy<br/>
or get them from friends with chickens. I am able to visit and share<br/>
in the caretaking of the chickens. We could even co-own them and<br/>
provide daily care, if we wanted to create that alternative. Same with<br/>
dogs, a friend does pet sitting to get her fix of dog love. Perhaps,<br/>
you could do animal fostering, or animal rescue for short durations<br/>
that don&#39;t impact dh, long term. Perhaps, you could provide animal<br/>
care in a vet or animal shelter. There are many ways to meet the<br/>
underlying needs for animal companionship and caretaking.<br/>
<br/>
There are always more than two options. <br/>

***I agree, living consensually is a totally different paradigm.<br/>
Additionally, Consensual Living isn&#39;t only related to parenting. For<br/>
me, Trust that there are solutions which will address everyone&#39;s needs<br/>
is the *process* of seeking and creating those solutions. When we halt<br/>
the process of seeking and creating solutions, by default, we can&#39;t<br/>
find them.<br/>

necessary or helpful to finding mutually agreeable solutions in our<br/>
family. In fact, I would find them to be contrary and obstacles to<br/>
creating agreeable solutions which meet everyone&#39;s needs. Solutions<br/>
which are imposed, are not mutually agreeable, ime. I sure wouldn&#39;t<br/>
like being coerced. I try to treat everyone like I wish to be treated.<br/>
Even more, I consider respect &#39;treating someone how they wish to be<br/>
treated&#39;. <br/>

<br/>
Yes, and after all of that has been explored sometimes you just have<br/>
two people that LIKE the front seat. You can see better and there is<br/>
no way to make the back seat be the same. <br/>
<br/>
And while there are always more than two options, the alternatives<br/>
aren&#39;t always what a person really wants either. I want my own dog. I<br/>
want a greyhound. Sierra also. We&#39;ve explored the alternatives and<br/>
it&#39;s not as satisfying. Sometimes we don&#39;t get exactly what we want in<br/>
the moment......life is like that. We can get what we want long term<br/>
if we&#39;re willing to FLEX.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m wondering if the word that Ren was looking for was more<br/>
&quot;distraction&quot; than coercion.  Keon can have a very physical way of<br/>
working out is emotions (including happy, sad, angry, tired, content,<br/>
etc.)  There have been many times that I have had to distract Keon<br/>
from his emotions temporarily, especially when people or property are<br/>
at risk of injury.  I don&#39;t see it as coercion.  I see it as breaking<br/>
his physical reaction long enough to get him in a safe environment<br/>
where he can be more physical.  Sometimes that means taking him to a<br/>
park or stream and letting him throw things.  Sometimes it means going<br/>
to his room (with him) and stroking his back while he throws a rage on<br/>
his bed or floor.  Coercion would be convincing him that he didn&#39;t<br/>
need to express himself so physically.  Distraction is breaking the<br/>
moment until he can safely express himself how he needs to.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had the pleasure of watching Ren parent her children and know<br/>
sweet little Jalen who can have a powerful personality.  I don&#39;t<br/>
recall her using methods that I viewed as coercive.  I felt she was<br/>
always respectful towards as many people&#39;s needs as she could.<br/>
Sometimes that meant distracting one of her children momentarily.<br/>
Maybe it is a difference of what we consider coercive.  Perhaps to an<br/>
unschooler distraction may appear coercive whereas to someone not as<br/>
familiar with unschooling and/or consensual living  distraction may<br/>
not seem coercive at all.  I truly see coercion as that which one does<br/>
to force someone to change one&#39;s mind.  m-w.com defines coerce as:<br/>
1 : to restrain or dominate by force &lt;religion in the past has tried<br/>
to coerce the irreligious -- W. R. Inge&gt;<br/>
2 : to compel to an act or choice &lt;was coerced into agreeing&gt;<br/>
3 : to achieve by force or threat &lt;coerce compliance&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see Ren (or much of anyone else here) acting as such!  I see<br/>
words that just don&#39;t meld well with unschooling:  restrain, dominate,<br/>
force, compel, threat.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1501383735">I&#39;m mostly just reading these posts and not totally understanding everything you all are saying, but I do have to chime in on one thing.  I have a 6 year old with Asperger&#39;s.  It&#39;s a neurological disorder.  She is special needs.  Her world is much different than the world most of us live in.  She will and does hurt her 8 year old sister. Also my 6 year old flies into horrible rages, where she will kick doors and punch walls.......it&#39;s impossible to talk out any kind of solution when she is like this. When she is hurting her sister she has to be removed from the situation........period, end of story.  I as a parent have to protect the child that is getting hurt in this situation.  So I&#39;m definately with you on this one Ren.  I can do the whole gentle parenting, coming up with solutions, compromising, whatever anyone wants to call it with my 8 year old.  She is your what society would consider &quot;normal&quot;........not that I like that particular label.  Mariah is another story. <br/>
 Mariah does not process things the way other&#39;s would.  Like for instance the whole sitting in front of the seat thing as an example (my kids are both in care seats being that they are both under 50 lbs. so this is just for an example only).  If Lexi and Mariah were arguing over who could sit in the front seat and we decided that to meet both needs we would take turns doing this.  What would happen in our case is that Mariah would end up on the ground outside kicking and screaming because she could not sit in the front seat this particular time.  And when she is kicking and screaming we can&#39;t even talk to her......she can&#39;t be reasoned with.  I find that there are times that we just can&#39;t meet everyones needs....especially in the short term.  We do try to come up with compromises (or whatever word each person wants to attach to it), but we just find that with parenting a special needs child we can&#39;t always do that.  <br/>
