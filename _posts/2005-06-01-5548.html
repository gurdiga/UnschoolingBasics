I&#39;m thinking that it might help you if you separate your concerns - <br/>
you&#39;ve lumped together: not doing anything, doing too much computer, <br/>
fighting with each other, watching tv that you clearly don&#39;t think has <br/>
a lot of value, having some kind of negative attitudes.<br/>
<br/>
If you separate each of these - you can probably figure out what is <br/>
really bothering you.<br/>
<br/>
Also - might it be that it isn&#39;t any of these things - but that you&#39;re <br/>
worried because they are now &quot;teens&quot; and you think they ought to be <br/>
heading toward accomplishing something -gearing up for college or <br/>
work/career?<br/>
<br/>
Getting really clear on what your specific problem/concern is, will <br/>
help a lot.<br/>
<br/>
What comes across, otherwise, is just that you&#39;re generally not happy <br/>
with the way they &quot;are.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I want to respond to one thing - separating it from the rest:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I am not against the computer but feel like it and<br/>
&gt; The Sims is the be all and end all of life nowadays.  That and reruns <br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; Friends on the T.V. Should I start panicking yet?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ruth - my 17 yo spends as much as 10 hours a day on the computer and <br/>
there was a long time when that was with SIMS. These days it is a <br/>
literary character role-playing game.  For a long time she was writing <br/>
&quot;descs&quot; (descriptions of characters) for other people on other role <br/>
playing games. She IMs with other kids.<br/>
<br/>
My 20 year old did a lot of that, for years, but does almost NONE <br/>
anymore - barely checks her email.<br/>
<br/>
My 14 yo spends maybe 2 or 3 hours a day - sometimes playing games, <br/>
mostly talking online and part of the time she is writing stories.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m telling you about my kids, so you&#39;ll know that there are others who <br/>
really know what it is to have kids who are &quot;on&quot; so much of the time. <br/>
(My kids say, &quot;I&#39;m getting on,&quot; or &quot;Are you getting on?&quot; or &quot;Is <br/>
so-and-so on?&quot; &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what the attraction of SIMS is - it doesn&#39;t appeal to me <br/>
at ALL. I get bored in minutes when my kids want to show me what <br/>
they&#39;re doing with it. But it sure does have some kind of strong appeal <br/>
and does a good job of meeting some sort of needs. So - there&#39;s that <br/>
trust thing. I trust that my kids are choosing to spend all those hours <br/>
on it because it meets a need, gives them pleasure, they derive <br/>
satisfaction from it - that&#39;s the proof that it is worthwhile, that <br/>
they choose it.<br/>
<br/>
Now - they choose it in the midst of a million other possibilities. <br/>
That&#39;s how I know it MUST be great!<br/>
If they didn&#39;t live in the midst of all those other possibilities - if <br/>
I thought they just didn&#39;t have much else to do, then that would be <br/>
different.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2051379745">Hi Pam<br/>
<br/>
Thinking about it it is the fighting that is really getting to me. I am not *that* bothered they play Sims and watch T.V  and, as you say in the midst of all the other possibilities it must be serving a purpose. Just cos I don&#39;t like it doesn&#39;t mean it is not important to them.  Also the teen thing and to gearing up to college e.t.c doesn&#39;t bother me either. My kids all have AS and tbh I don&#39;t want them to  grow up fast. I like the fact they still play and are children.  We recently had a huge battle with our education authority over the children&#39;s education. The inspector was not happy with the &quot;lack of evidence&quot; of &quot;work&quot; and  wanted third party testing of my two youngest which I refused and had to go and see a senior officer over.  That has shock me up.  It was 6 months of stress and worry.  When you asked me what I was bothered about that came to mind straightaway so thanks for saying that.  I am now thinking maybe they have picked up on it all.   They know all the stuff they did show the inspector was rubbished by her as &quot;not enough&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I think maybe the answer is to buy another computer lol.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
<br/>

my post. Then I reread it and thought that starting with, &quot;Buy more <br/>
computers,&quot; sounded like I was being a smart-aleck.<br/>
<br/>
But - two things can really make a difference in my teenagers &quot;getting <br/>
along&quot; - space of their own and plentiful computer access!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh - and having more computers meant that the computer time was not <br/>
&quot;serial&quot; it was &quot;simultaneous.&quot; Before, the minute one kid was off the <br/>
computer, another was on it. There was never any time that we were all <br/>
&quot;off&quot; at the same time. That gave me an odd feeling - like our family <br/>
was disconnected from each other - always &quot;missing&quot; one person. Now we <br/>
can all put down our computers at the same time and do something <br/>
together.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-90208773">Yes ikwym about being disconnected. I have stood back and we had a discussion about getting another computer.  They were not in favour cos the games they use they all use and would still have to take turns unless I buy more of the same games. I still think that is a better idea tho so I will look into it.  I feel burnt out and I shouldn&#39;t. Stuff has definitely gone wrong.  I think I have tried too hard to direct them after the LEA visit and I shouldn&#39;t.  I trusted them up to then and nothing changed really. They have had times in the past of doing what appears very little.  It was me who lost confidence not them. I asked them all if they are happy with their unschooling lives - if they feel fulfilled and content they are learning what they need and they all without exception said yes. They also felt I had changed and that had confusd them and caused them stress.. So I said sorry. That is 7 happy kids and that is what counts to me.<br/>
