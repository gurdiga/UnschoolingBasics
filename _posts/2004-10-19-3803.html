<div id="ygrps-yiv-746363872">Thanks to everyone for the congrats!<br/>
<br/>
And thank you for the ideas on how to deal with Jason being gone. We will know this week if he&#39;ll be going and I think they leave on the 1st. <br/>
<br/>
Something I&#39;m wondering about, don&#39;t know if there is anyone in this posistion...<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t drive, I don&#39;t know how. We&#39;re in Michigan, by way of San Diego. There are grocery stores about a mile from me, it&#39;s a nice easy walk, when it&#39;s warm. I&#39;m not sure about walking with a newborn if it&#39;s really cold...anybody do this? I have family close that is willing to help, sometimes. Although all help comes with the anti-homeschooling lectures, so I don&#39;t ask for help....I&#39;m guessing that I&#39;ll have to bite my tounge and smile and nod a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, it&#39;ll be as it&#39;s meant to be. :)<br/>
<br/>
All the kids are asleep or otherwise happy and occupied, I think I may go take a shower! <br/>
<br/>
(funny the things that excite me now)<br/>

do you have a sling?  I was going to suggest it earlier, my youngest  lived <br/>
in it, even learned to nurse in it while I was running around after her  <br/>
brother.  The baby will stay nice and toasty up against mom.<br/>

I don&#39;t have a sling, I have one of those Snugli things, kinda like a baby back pack, that you wear on your chest. I use it now when we go out, I wasn&#39;t sure if it would be warm enough later in the year, once it gets alot colder.<br/>

 <br/>
We lived in Germany when my boys were young.  Really you don&#39;t need  that <br/>
much stuff.  My oldest was and is very sensitive.  They both  sleep with us, no <br/>
bassinet, no crib, and I used a sling.  That is the best  thing around.  No <br/>
need for the swing, walker etc.  I walked with them  in the winter.  Would <br/>
snuggle them up in the sling and they stayed nice and  warm and could nurse.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2136799907">i second the idea of a fleece sling -- but  if you wanted to keep using the Snugli,  you could also buy (or make if you sew) a mama coat -- has a detachable front section to keep the baby inside the coat with you. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1535968809">There&#39;s a great site (not mine) called thebabywearer.com <br/>
that has impartial reviews of tons of slings. You can find <br/>
something for any age/size baby or any budget. They <br/>
don&#39;t sell slings there, but they help you figure out which <br/>
one would be best for you. <br/>
<br/>
I never did like my snugli and didn&#39;t realize until I started <br/>
researching (when DD was 8 weeks old) that there are <br/>
dozens of better options out there that are all completely <br/>
different from each other. Now I own at least 6 different <br/>
slings that I use at different times for different reasons <br/>
and I even started a nonprofit org to promote babywearing. <br/>

Best of luck!<br/>
