<div id="ygrps-yiv-721931018">I just had a beautiful unschooling moment with my daughter, Ashton. <br/>
<br/>
She is ten. <br/>
<br/>
She has been creating all day. She has the hot glue gun and bunches <br/>
of  popcicle sticks. She has built herself a village. Not because of <br/>
anything than her desire to build it. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;One of the best things about doing art is if you can think of it you <br/>
can build it&quot; she said to me. &quot; I just keep thinking of cool things to <br/>
make and then my creativity just does it.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I told her that was true for life too. If you think of it you can <br/>
create it.<br/>
<br/>
I am so lucky to be her mom.</div>
