No I think she was referring to the original poster. She said she has 7 boys.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-911119931">It helped me the most as a newbie to read Sandra Dodd and Joyce<br/>
Fetteroll&#39;s websites on unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
Also try searching &quot;math&quot; in the archives or &quot;newbie.&quot; It can get a<br/>
little overwhelming so the sites above help make addressing the issues<br/>
generally easier. :)<br/>

&gt; Hello!!! I&#39;m new to this group and to uschooling.  I was wondering if<br/>
&gt; anyone might direct me to the best postings in this group to read to<br/>
&gt; get me started in the basics?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I homeschool 3 beautiful children that truly love learning (not from<br/>
&gt; a textbook).  We have tried various methods of homeschooling (charter<br/>
&gt; school, ISP through a private school, and now we are our own private<br/>
&gt; school and follow our own rules!!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have fears that I&#39;m not teaching them what they really need to<br/>
&gt; learn as far as math and grammar, etc. goes by giving up a textbook<br/>
&gt; and worksheets.  How do I learn to let go of those fears.  How can I<br/>
&gt; unschool math or prepare my highschooler for college?  My 8 year old<br/>
&gt; groans (loudly) if I ask him to pick up a book and read it to me.<br/>
&gt; Yet, he will read words on his video game, computer, tv, billboards,<br/>
&gt; etc.  Is that enough?  I really need some quick advice on just what<br/>
&gt; unschooling is and how to get going at it so we all can be calm and<br/>
&gt; enjoy life.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks to anyone who responds!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
