<div id="ygrps-yiv-2106388668">&quot;I don&#39;t know how much the therapy<br/>
had to do with that, but I know it was not wholly due to it because <br/>
he<br/>
had developed so much between his initial evaluation and his first<br/>
evaluation. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry, but I laughed when I read how your son had only a few <br/>
words at 2.5. Do you know how common that is? Only in our age-<br/>
segregated, academically oriented society is that a &quot;problem&quot;. <br/>
Cripes! He was 2.5!!! I doubt the therapy had much to do with it at <br/>
all....it&#39;s kind of like if you had therapy or a curriculum to teach <br/>
babies to walk and you started using it around 6months. Eventually <br/>
the child would walk and everyone would say how great the &quot;therapy&quot; <br/>
or curriculum was, when in truth, the child was just READY.<br/>
<br/>
My Jalen had very few words in his vocabulary back in November when <br/>
we visited family in Alaska. He was 2.9. Most of the time he&#39;d point <br/>
at things and say &quot;sttthhhhh&quot;. My Grandmother was a bit worried, I  <br/>
just laughed at her and said &quot;he&#39;ll talk when he&#39;s ready&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Guess what? He went from hardly talking at ALL up until Jan/Feb. <br/>
then suddenly started putting two and three words together, then <br/>
full sentences, all within a few months. He talks up a storm now. <br/>
Complex sentences, huge vocabulary and no problem communicating <br/>
anything. He did it when he was ready. I knew he didn&#39;t have hearing <br/>
problems so we just let him BE.<br/>
He started talking proficiently almost overnight, a bit after his <br/>
third birthday. You wouldn&#39;t know he was any different than any <br/>
other three year old today. WAIT...that&#39;s usually always my advice. <br/>
Trust that they will learn what they need, when THEY need it.<br/>
That&#39;s the trust unschooling can give us.<br/>
