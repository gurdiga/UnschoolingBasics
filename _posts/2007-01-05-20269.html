 </span></blockquote>Danielle (14) uses skype (better than team speak she says) ALL the <br/>
time!   She says she can&#39;t imagine how she played before when she had <br/>
to just type and read, but she&#39;s got 2 level 60 characters so she&#39;s <br/>
involved in a lot of raids with a group.<br/>
<br/>
She said she&#39;s interested in joining and doesn&#39;t mind creating new <br/>
characters, in fact she has several, alliance and horde, at many <br/>
different levels!  I&#39;ll forward this info to her!<br/>

That was old info I had (going on memory, she was sleeping when I <br/>
posted earlier).   Her guild now uses ventrillo.com.   She says team <br/>
speak and skype aren&#39;t as good (less clear).   With ventrillo  (they <br/>
call it &quot;vent&quot;) you have to create a server and make adjustments (she <br/>
didn&#39;t set it up so that&#39;s about all she knows).   Also, something <br/>
about &quot;speaks&quot; is desirable (in the setup/adjustments part), it makes <br/>
it more clear when talking to each other.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps!<br/>

My brother Cole and I have decided that we would like to be a part of<br/>
the unschooling guild. We just started playing a couple of days ago<br/>
and this is really our first online gaming or mmorpg experience. Can<br/>
us virgin online gamers join your guild as well? We are hoping that if<br/>
we do we can learn really fast with this WoW World is all about. <br/>
Thank you so much,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-561666655">So sorry...one other thing:<br/>
We noticed that the server/realm for the Unschooling Guild is an RP<br/>
realm. After reading the &quot;guidelines&quot; on the WoW site we so confused<br/>
as to how to even act on an RP server. Keeping in mind that we have<br/>
never even thought of playing an rp game before this. So do we have to<br/>
back story and entire character work ups? Thank you again for your<br/>
knowledge and help :)<br/>
