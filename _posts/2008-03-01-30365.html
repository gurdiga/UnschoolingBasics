<div id="ygrps-yiv-73186421">Hi Folks,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m forwarding this message to you from our local unschooling <br/>
community, if you are interested.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Our small Sunday meditation group will be meeting<br/>
&gt;again this Sunday, 3/2 at 6 pm EST to help Lisa along on<br/>
&gt;her journey and give strength, love, support, a much<br/>
&gt;needed gift of energy, etc., to Larry, Ruby & Roxanne.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Please feel free to join us again &quot;virtually&quot; from<br/>
&gt;where ever you are at about that time.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Also, many folks have contributed to Lisa&#39;s Memorial, and Larry, <br/>
Roxy, and Fire are very moved by all the messages and gifts they have <br/>
been receiving.  If you&#39;re interested in posting or just reading, you <br/>
can find the memorial page at<br/>

<br/>
By the way, if you have any photographs of Lisa you would like to <br/>
share from any of the conferences or any time, please do send <br/>
them.  It would be wonderful to see her through your eyes.  Send them <br/>
to me off list at:<br/>

<br/>
Thank you again for all the wonderful messages and support.<br/>
<br/>
In deepest gratitude,<br/>
<br/>
Marji<br/>
