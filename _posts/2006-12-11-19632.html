Any tips or experiences are appreciated. I don&#39;t let it show to  him,<br/>
but it&#39;s really wearing on me. I love his hugs and holding his  hand.<br/>
But the &quot;having an extra body attached to me&quot; is wearing on  me...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OH! I miss that time so much!!!! But I remember feeling  a little like you <br/>
are describing when things were &#39;crazy clingy&#39; and then  feeling guilty! One <br/>
thing that worked so well for all three of mine was  *getting them* before they <br/>
get me :-) so for example, if they were calmly  playing on the carpet with <br/>
legos at my feet while I was at the computer my  thoughts were &quot;oh good I can have <br/>
a second to myself&quot; but my actions were  to get on the floor for a few <br/>
minutes and kiss, hug, hold cuddle and be  the instigator of all the mushiness. It <br/>
&quot;filled them up&quot; with what they  needed and helped them be less clingy. It also <br/>
helped for me to  assume that EVERYONE was sleeping with me every single <br/>
night, then if they  didn&#39;t want to, they would go out to their own beds on their <br/>
own. My  7 year old daughter still sleeps in my bed 90% of the time but she is <br/>
 always welcome there and encouraged. My boys LAUGH if I ask them if they  <br/>
want to sleep there (they are 9 and 11) and are totally independent now,  but <br/>
that wasn&#39;t always the case. If something sad happens (like when our  dog died) <br/>
or if someone feels sick, they always end up with me. It is a  really nice way <br/>
for them to get comfort and security. I&#39;m so glad they  still feel like it is <br/>
totally ok to do so! Hang in there - it does  get better and then you will <br/>
want it all back again!<br/>
