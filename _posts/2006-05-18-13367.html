<div id="ygrps-yiv-501713320">An additional idea -<br/>
<br/>
A mom in our little unschooling group who has 3 kids under six regularly <br/>
hires my 13yo daughter to come do the art thing with her kids.<br/>
<br/>
She had found herself dreading the mess nearly to the point of never letting <br/>
them do anything, and feeling that perhaps she should send the oldest to <br/>
school so she&#39;d get to be creative. <br/>
<br/>
The kids look forward to having Sarah over, Sarah loves the kids and the art <br/>
and doesn&#39;t mind cleaning the mess (probably because it&#39;s the only mess she&#39;ll <br/>
deal with that day.) She&#39;s been there for painting, chalk drawings, play <br/>
dough, collage, and helped the kids make garden stepping stones for their <br/>
grandmother at Christmas time.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s win/win/win. The kids are joyously creative, mom is able to be serene <br/>
about it all, and my daughter earns a decent amount of cash AND gets to enjoy <br/>
creative time with younger kids she adores. <br/>
