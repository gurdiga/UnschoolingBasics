<br/>
Two days ago, the kids that were all up at Kelly&#39;s for the pool party<br/>
got all into the whole Mentos/Coke discussion. Arielle decided she was<br/>
going to drink Coke and swallow a Mentos. Trevor was having a fit<br/>
because he was worried about her safety.<br/>
<br/>
They got onto Kelly&#39;s computer and looked up all kinds of videos<br/>
showing explosions.<br/>
<br/>
Cool videos! They didn&#39;t find those, so we have more Mentos/Coke stuff<br/>
to look at now. Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Trevor has a mohawk now and Arielle totally shaved her head. If only<br/>
we&#39;d had some Mentos and Coke to experiment with...they wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
gone after Kelly&#39;s dog grooming shears instead!!!:)<br/>

and asked for cuts, Sam&#39;s got a mohawk, Dan has a mimsy (what we call  <br/>
short all over with bangs), Josh is more boring he NEVER wants  <br/>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
Yep, that just happened at our house recently, too!  Stone (4.75) asked for a mohawk, so we got out the clippers and headed to the front porch.  Then baby Sage decided he wanted to crawl up into the chair, then motioned for the cape, then the clippers (communicating darn well without using any words yet!)  So, I followed his lead and gave him a little buzz (did leave some long on top, just couldn&#39;t part with the baby hair quite yet-it&#39;s kind of groovy, funky cool though! :)<br/>
Then big brother decided he was up for a cut, too!  <br/>
Fun!<br/>

Use DIET.. it won&#39;t get everything all sticky since there isn&#39;t sugar <br/>
in it :)<br/>
