<div id="ygrps-yiv-969866225">&quot; None of that schooling helped in my adult life at all.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I meant to say something about this earlier, then Heidi brought it up.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;thing&quot; Kelly and I did at the conference, in our break out<br/>
session, was actually based on the &quot;test&quot; I talked about a while back.<br/>
<br/>
A few of you asked about the questions on it, but I still haven&#39;t<br/>
found my original. Here&#39;s the conference version we did;<br/>
<br/>
1) List all of the ways you&#39;ve made money in your entire life (include<br/>
your younger years, small/side jobs, career paths etc...)<br/>
<br/>
2) List all of the interests and hobbies you have pursued in the past<br/>
or pursue today. ALL of them.<br/>
<br/>
3) List all of the things you&#39;d like to learn before you die.... ALL<br/>
interests or topics you&#39;d like to learn before you leave this earth (<br/>
or before you turn 90 or whatever).<br/>
<br/>
After listing all of these activities, tally them up.<br/>
Then, go through your list and make a notation somewhere for every<br/>
activity you got proficient at by attending school.<br/>
<br/>
Makes you REALLY say &quot;none of that schooling helped in my adult life<br/>
at all&quot; eh?!<br/>
<br/>
My original also had something about listing all the degrees you&#39;ve<br/>
earned and whether or not you were using them today. If you were using<br/>
them, the next question was; &quot;Do you LOVE your work? Are you<br/>
passionate about what you do?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In one talk I did, someone actually had 2 or 3 items they said were<br/>
learned in school (that was out of 23ish I believe). After he gave me<br/>
that total I started questioning him.<br/>
<br/>
It turns out that one of the passions &quot;learned in school&quot; was a love<br/>
of other cultures and geography. The way he learned about all that in<br/>
school? Well, he attended a really cool private school in EUROPE. Kids<br/>
attended from all over the world and his EXPOSURE to all these people<br/>
from different places is the way he learned about diversity and<br/>
sparked this passion.<br/>
I asked him if he thought a person could learn that just as easilly by<br/>
exposing themselves to a wide range of people and places, rather than<br/>
in school and he agreed wholeheartedly.<br/>
So it wasn&#39;t the schooling itself that helped him with this, it was<br/>
the sheer exposure, being surrounded by interesting people!<br/>
<br/>
One of his other interests, reading, was obviously something that<br/>
could be easily learned outside of school.<br/>
So by the end of exploring his school learning, he decided that the<br/>
school was actually irrelevant to his life today. The rich and varied<br/>
experiences were the thing that mattered.<br/>
<br/>
That &quot;test&quot; is what Heidi is referring to in relation to Kevin&#39;s list<br/>
of interests. You can all go give yourself the test now, if you have<br/>
ANY remaining doubts about unschooling.:)<br/>
