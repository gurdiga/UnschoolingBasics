<div id="ygrps-yiv-700417358">We&#39;ve had several new folks sign on recently, and I really like to <br/>
welcome everyone individually, but I&#39;m just going to post a <br/>
general &quot;welcome&quot; to you all this time.<br/>
<br/>
I think Rue, DebL and Kelly must be busy with holiday stuff as I seem <br/>
to have many emails to approve each time I log on!!:)<br/>
<br/>
If you haven&#39;t had a chance to browse through our &quot;links&quot; section, <br/>
please do so when you have time...it&#39;s full of really great websites <br/>
and other recommendations for unschooling information.<br/>
<br/>
Glad you&#39;re here,<br/>
<br/>
Ren<br/>
