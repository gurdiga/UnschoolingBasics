<div id="ygrps-yiv-1198681457">Short and sweet summary:<br/>
Establish and/or enroll in a &#39;church school&#39;<br/>
File notice of enrollment and attendance on form provided (one time,<br/>
when you start, not annual)<br/>
Maintain daily attendance record to be kept by the &#39;church school&#39;<br/>
<br/>
No other paperwork (testing, portfolios, etc) seems to be required by<br/>
law, but the &#39;church school&#39; can decide what they want to do.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.leapingfromthebox.com/hs/alhs.html">http://www.leapingfromthebox.com/hs/alhs.html</a> looks to be a pretty<br/>
inclusive site (They even include &quot;unschooling&quot; right at the top next to<br/>
homeschooling) Note that &#39;church school&#39; is very vague - if you consider<br/>
your home a place of worship, then you can potentially just set up a<br/>
&#39;church school&#39; for yourself (but they note that you&#39;d want to be really<br/>
careful to make sure you KNOW the laws and are prepared to make your<br/>
case in court).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, don&#39;t. Don&#39;t use HSLDA for anything! They have a fundamentalist  <br/>
Christian agenda and don&#39;t support unschooling. (And that&#39;s just the  <br/>
tip of the iceberg.) If anyone wants to know more about why HSLDA  <br/>
should be avoided: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://hsislegal.com/">http://hsislegal.com/</a><br/>

<br/>
They have laws for each state. But even better is finding your state  <br/>
homeschooling group and reading about laws there. They should have  <br/>
support group listings of groups for each state too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-276896992">Hi, we&#39;re not in Alabama, but I did a quick search, and this link <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.homeschoolinginalabama.com/gettingstarted/legal/statelaws.a">http://www.homeschoolinginalabama.com/gettingstarted/legal/statelaws.a</a><br/>
spx<br/>
<br/>
brings you to Homeschooling in Alabama website.  I briefly looked <br/>
around, and, for some reason, the laws look kind of strict in AL.  <br/>
<br/>
From the site:  <br/>
&quot;Alabama does not recognize homeschooling as a separate legal option. <br/>
Homeschoolers in Alabama educate their children according to the <br/>
provisions set forth in certain laws and State Board Resolutions that <br/>
pertain to private schools in Alabama and, therefore, most <br/>
find &quot;covering&quot; or &quot;umbrella&quot; church schools which will oversee their <br/>
homeschooling programs. According to the Attorney General of <br/>
Alabama, &quot;other than the state laws requiring parents to report <br/>
attendance and for church schools to report if a student is no longer <br/>
in attendance at such a church school, there is no provision of <br/>
Alabama law that permits or requires any state or local authority to <br/>
regulate a church school.&quot; NHEN<br/>
<br/>
And the Homeschool Legal Defense Association gives their legal <br/>
analysis of Alabama Statutes here (also linked from orig site <br/>
mentioned):  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hslda.org/laws/analysis/Alabama.pdf">http://www.hslda.org/laws/analysis/Alabama.pdf</a><br/>
<br/>
After reading this, I must say, good luck!  (or maybe you <br/>
could &quot;maintain&quot; your FL residence, for unschooling purposes?)<br/>
