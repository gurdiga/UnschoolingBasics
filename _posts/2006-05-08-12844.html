<div id="ygrps-yiv-14267082">realized this... when i wake up in the morning i need to ask the girls <br/>
what they want to do with the day rather than thinking about what i <br/>
need to accomplish....now i will be able to accomplish &quot;this or that&quot; <br/>
as they will often desire to play with dolls, do a puzzle, watch a <br/>
movie, ride scooters, or play a computer game just by themselves in <br/>
which case i can work on the things i would like to accomplish....BUT <br/>
realizing that not everyday will i get that done and it is &#39;learning <br/>
all the time&#39; to put them first and play, explore, read, scoot, watch <br/>
or dig *with* them if and when they desire that!!<br/>
<br/>
i know....duh, but i have had the tendency to &quot;get my stuff done <br/>
first&quot; and then....blah blah blah.<br/>
