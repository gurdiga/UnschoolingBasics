<div id="ygrps-yiv-1393135923">Dear friends,<br/>
I write to you today to update you on Hannah&#39;s condition.  I don&#39;t have all<br/>
the details, only that she has taken a turn for the worse.  She came home<br/>
Tuesday evening, and then Diana had to take her back into the hospital<br/>
Wednesday afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
At present, she has some very serious life threatening infection raging<br/>
through her body.  She is in a medically induced coma and surrounded by<br/>
family.  <br/>
<br/>
My request is that every one of you please light a candle for Hannah and<br/>
keep it burning so that your light and energy may reach her right now.<br/>
Please keep her and Diana and Hayden in your hearts and send them some very<br/>
serious healing energy.<br/>
<br/>
I will do my best to keep you informed.  I haven&#39;t spoken with Diana<br/>
personally, yet.  She and Hayden was resting when I called.<br/>
<br/>
Please forward this on to those who need to know.<br/>
<br/>
In love and light,<br/>
Karen</div>
