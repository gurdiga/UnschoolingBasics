She&#39;s  actually watching TV all day. When would <br/>
be the right moment to suggest  other things to do? should I suggest <br/>
anything at all, she&#39;s happily  watching TV all day, why should I <br/>
interrupt her? But maybe she&#39;s just  watching tv for lack of better <br/>
things to do! But TV isn&#39;t bad, so nothing  is &quot;better&quot;. Ok, then I <br/>
should suggest something. I suggest something, she  doesn&#39;t want to. <br/>
Hm â€“ but maybe she wants to do something else. Should I  suggest <br/>
another thing? But then I interrupt again. But maybe she needs  more <br/>
imput! and so on and on &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
If you find something cool that you think she might enjoy just ask  her.  As <br/>
long as she feels it is ok to say &quot;not today mom, I am watching  XYZ on TV&quot;.  <br/>
Then there is no problem.  She can always so NO.  I  see so many things out <br/>
there to do that my boys don&#39;t see, because I read the  newspaper and they <br/>
don&#39;t, because I am online with other local groups and hear  what is available and <br/>
they aren&#39;t, etc.  I would be doing them a great  disservice to know of all <br/>
these cool things and not tell them about it so they  have the opportunity to <br/>
say yes or no.  Maybe don&#39;t think about it quite so  much and just ask, just <br/>
live.  <br/>
 <br/>
If your hubby saw something cool going on this weekend he thought the  family <br/>
might like, he would probably ask if anyone wanted to go.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1933285955">&quot;I believe that being genuine in what you do -- in<br/>
whatever you do -- is the most important.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is worth repeating!  Being genuine, being authentic, THAT is what<br/>
our children need to see. They need to see your passions, whatever<br/>
those are but you don&#39;t need to adopt interests for her sake, you need<br/>
to do it for YOU! Showing an interest in the things that fascinate her<br/>
is important too, but it doesn&#39;t mean you will adore the same things<br/>
of course.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have underlying interests that have been ignored? Are there<br/>
things that tickle your fancy that you&#39;ve put off? Dig that stuff<br/>
out....dive into whatever you love. Sit with her and share what she<br/>
loves. FEED her interest in television, don&#39;t just tolerate it!:)<br/>
