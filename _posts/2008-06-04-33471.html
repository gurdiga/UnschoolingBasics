<div id="ygrps-yiv-1602159505">I am having trouble and could use to listen to some new voices. In my<br/>
transition to RU, I have been trying very hard to say yes to ds9¹s requests<br/>
and to meet his needs _and wants_.  DH is following my path to RU from a<br/>
distance and at a slower rate. Based on ds9¹s request, we have recently<br/>
purchased a game system (used xbox), ds has used his money to purchase an<br/>
ipod and songs, we are buying the food he asks for (that no one else eats),<br/>
and we are trying our best to give him free choice in every way.<br/>
<br/>
So what¹s the problem? Now he wants an electric scooter/ride on toy. He has<br/>
talked himself into wanting a $470 model (up from 2 days ago when he wanted<br/>
a $200 electric scooter like one he used on a trip last week). He says we<br/>
have plenty of $$ and he should be able to get it this week. I spent an<br/>
entire day going over our family finances (again) with him, talking about<br/>
how we have to build our savings back up because we just paid cash for a<br/>
car, we need to save the $ for going to L&L (which he begged to do), etc. We<br/>
have been talking for months about budgets, cash flow (he has his own bank<br/>
account with ATM and uses quicken to track expenses), saving up for things<br/>
like the taxes on our house, etc. He is still stuck on the amount of $<br/>
flowing in and says he should get  the scooter without having to wait. He is<br/>
willing to pay $40 towards the scooter.<br/>
<br/>
We have in the past purchased things that were pricier than we would have<br/>
liked when we felt the money would be well spent. He has 3 bikes (one is a<br/>
racing bike since he is a bike racer and he can go faster than this electric<br/>
scooter!). He has nowhere to ride this scooter besides our driveway and our<br/>
small neighborhood road. My husband is having big problems with laying out<br/>
that much cash for something he sees no value in, anticipates very little<br/>
use of, and has not been a desire very long. He sees many adults who behave<br/>
in the same way wrt $$ and regards them as not being financially stable in<br/>
the long term.<br/>
<br/>
DS earned $ last month mowing  a friend¹s lawn and put that $ towards his<br/>
ipod. He saved and contributed to the racing bike last year because he<br/>
really wanted that one versus a less expensive model. Saving for big things<br/>
is not foreign for him. He was very proud of himself and his ability to save<br/>
for something really important when he paid for his bike and his ipod.<br/>
<br/>
There is a lot of tension in our house right now. Any ideas how to release<br/>
some tension and come to some agreement?<br/>
<br/>
Ciao,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1294254017">If it were $470 for something you valued, would the money be there? It<br/>
sounds like there&#39;s a mixed message - you don&#39;t have the money, but<br/>
you do if *you thought* the money would be &quot;well spent&quot;. Either the<br/>
money&#39;s there or it&#39;s not. If it would be there for something you<br/>
would choose for your son, it should be there for something he chooses<br/>
himself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1711557019">Well, family finances are real - I would think the whole family should have a say - could any one person in the family, kid or otherwise, say, &quot;I want this and I want it now&quot; without having to consult with the other members and all deciding together - it&#39;s tough making group decisions and this is part of the process - I think you are honouring your child *as a member of a group* - - would the same process apply if one of the parents wanted a non-essential item - (i.e. not food or shelter) isn&#39;t  So can we throw everybody&#39;s non-essentials into the same pot?  And go through the same process?  ...don&#39;t know, just asking...<br/>
