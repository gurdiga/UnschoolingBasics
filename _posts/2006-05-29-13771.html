<div id="ygrps-yiv-59835563">I seem to be a magnet for the kids that cause chaos.  Right now, there  is a <br/>
neighborhood girl named Ally, 8,  that always seems to cause  problems.  It <br/>
isn&#39;t that she is obviously a problem, but the problems tend  to come up when <br/>
she is around.  I guess you could say she is an instigator,  she does not <br/>
share.....at all (I&#39;m not kidding), and she will always do  something I have just <br/>
asked her not to do the moment my back is turned.   She tells my 5 year old <br/>
constantly to &quot;not tell her mommy.&quot;  She has  scratched my car, broken various <br/>
toys and items like fishing poles and plays  very rough games.<br/>
 <br/>
So far my strategy has to been to not let them play unless I am outside  (she <br/>
is no longer allowed in the house as she destroyed it the two times she was  <br/>
in).  This works OK except she is outside from the minute she is home from  <br/>
school until dark.  She has pretty much been turned away from the other  houses. <br/>
 I also thought she was moving this summer, but now I don&#39;t think  she is.  <br/>
So I need a new strategy.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve tried to enlist my kid&#39;s help, but they say they just tend to forget  <br/>
what is appropriate behavior when she is around.  For instance, my daughter  <br/>
would never eat a wild berry without asking, yet Ally made her eat one by  <br/>
pestering her until she did it.  My kids would never climb on top of a car  to have <br/>
a picnic, yet that is where I found them today.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t have these issues with the other neighbor kids.   Any  advise on how <br/>
to keep our happy unschooling family safe from this girl?<br/>
 <br/>

In any case, I&#39;d talk directly with the girl and spell out the kind of behavior that&#39;s okay at your home. If she wants to play there, she has to behave along the guidelines of your family.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1276990722">Do your kids really want to play with her?  Seriously, they may not <br/>
realize they have the option not to.  My son used to be like that.<br/>
<br/>

of her parents to help supervise.  I suspect that they send her over <br/>
to play so that they get unpaid babysitting.  I&#39;ve seen it before.<br/>
<br/>
If she damages your car -- might not the parents want to know, since <br/>
if it was my child (and I can&#39;t imagine him doing destructive things <br/>
intentionally), I would want to know and to make reparations -- and <br/>
have him work it out.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, the fact that she told your kids not to tell you something is a <br/>
huge red flag.  One thing I read somewhere that I thought was a <br/>
really neat way of discussing secrets -- there is no such thing as a <br/>
secret you can&#39;t tell anyone.  If it is a surprise for Mom, then you <br/>
can share it with Dad or Grandma or some such.  (I know, it veered a <br/>
bit off the topic, but it reminded me of that, and it is such a <br/>
really good way to help them understand the difference between good <br/>
secrets and &quot;don&#39;t tell&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*************<br/>
 <br/>
The parents are borderline neglectful.  Some of the neighbors have  tried to <br/>
speak to them and haven&#39;t gotten anywhere.  Plus, there is the  suspect of <br/>
really bad parenting and no one wants her to get in trouble.<br/>
 <br/>
***In any case, I&#39;d talk directly with the girl and spell out the kind of  <br/>
behavior that&#39;s okay at your home. If she wants to play there, she has to behave <br/>
 along the guidelines of your family. I&#39;d also be around when she&#39;s there  <br/>
supervising until you feel comfortable that she gets what is expected of  <br/>
her.*********<br/>
 <br/>
True.  I guess my problem here is trying to figure out how to define  <br/>
appropriate behavior to her.  She seems to have few boundaries, I would  have never <br/>
dreamed how to be proactive about the picnic on the car!  I do  feel like I <br/>
follow her around saying &quot;don&#39;t do that&quot;.  She takes everyday  activities and <br/>
makes them unsafe.  I have had my trampoline for years, I  have a net and no <br/>
child has ever fallen.  She fell off twice in one  day....somehow throwing herself <br/>
through the access flap!!<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m thinking I&#39;ll have to set a time limit on her visits.    Unfortunately, I <br/>
cannot be outside from 3 to 9 each day!  This is also  difficult as the other <br/>
neighborhood kids don&#39;t need this type of supervision and  my own kids love <br/>
being with these friends so much!  So is it that only  Ally has to leave?  <br/>
 <br/>
Joanne, you suggested meeting at a park.  Good idea (which I&#39;ll  remember for <br/>
the future) but here the neighborhood kids are all riding  bikes and going <br/>
from house to house to play.  Plus, her parents wouldn&#39;t  take her.<br/>
 <br/>
A neighbor told me today that she thinks Ally is going to her dad&#39;s house  <br/>
for summer break....6 weeks as the kids here are in year round school.   Maybe <br/>
that will be enough for some good changes to come!<br/>

 <br/>
Yes, they want to play with her.  Wish they didn&#39;t.<br/>
 <br/>
Never seen her parents up close, wouldn&#39;t know them if they knocked on my  <br/>
door.<br/>
 <br/>
As far as damages, she hasn&#39;t done any damage worth getting the parents  <br/>
involved.  But I&#39;ll definitely keep that in mind.<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe I should ask the parents for babysitting money. Maybe they&#39;ll  tell her <br/>
she can&#39;t play over here anymore!!  Perhaps me and the other mom&#39;s  should <br/>
send a note saying that since we are watching her, we want to be  paid for it!<br/>
 <br/>
And you are right, Linda.  The minute I heard that she was saying  &quot;don&#39;t <br/>
tell your mom&quot;, I got even less trustful of this child!  Good idea  about the <br/>
secret thing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1786978616">This is such an interesting thread. <br/>
<br/>
I have been the neighborhood house. And we have especially attracted <br/>
wilder kids at our house. Perhaps because we are a bit wild. <br/>
<br/>
I think you need to set boundaries you are comfortable with. Like <br/>
she can play for an hour and then direct your family to another <br/>
activity for a bit. <br/>
<br/>
I always looked at it as a chance to do some good modeling. It may <br/>
be the way she chooses to be a better parent. But setting boundaries <br/>
that work for you is part of that modelling.<br/>
<br/>
As far as picnic on the cars and dangerous activities be very clear <br/>
why that does not work. One danger, two a dent in the car hood would <br/>
be costly. Ask where else would be a fun spot for a picnic. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As far as the trampoline, I would be sure to ask her parents to sign <br/>
a release. I would also be certain to say, if she falls out, or off, <br/>
that perhaps she needs to do something else for a time.<br/>
<br/>
It becomes very interesting with an unschooling philosophy to <br/>
continue to model and set boundaries where everyone is safe and we <br/>
are being respected. I have struggled to not be a dormat while still <br/>
empowering my kids. It seems the ones who try to take advantage are <br/>
often their schooled friends. <br/>
<br/>
I think the secret area is a great chance for a talk. I would be <br/>
very clear in front of all of the kids why you think secrets are not <br/>
a good idea. Also how you want to hear what your kids are doing so <br/>
you can help them do what they want to do. Just let her know it is <br/>
your job as their mom to help them get done the things that they <br/>
want to and to make sure everyone is safe doing it. Then talk about <br/>
what kinds of secrets are fun for you, like birthday secrets or <br/>
party secrets. <br/>
<br/>
Also it really is okay for you to say not today. But if all the <br/>
neighborhood kids are out I see your challenge. Perhaps just <br/>
changing the pace and playing for a bit and then loading in the car <br/>
and going for icecream, or to the mall or park to change to pace for <br/>
your kids. <br/>
<br/>
Those are all my ideas. Toss them all if they do not apply.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If it&#39;s unhealthy or unsafe for your children to have her around then I would say yes. I&#39;d work with her awhile, informing her of the principles in your home. But I&#39;d also explain that if she can&#39;t be there in a safe manner, she&#39;ll have to go home.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-273072145">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
A few things I would think about. <br/>
<br/>
If her behavior outside your home with your kids is potentially dangerous, find a way to be outside the whole time they play, and if you can&#39;t bring your kids in, even if it is for a potty break. I have a son who can not always maintain his peaceful self outside and neighbor kids sometimes trigger him into explosive behavior. As much as I would like to be doing something else sometimes, I have to be an open ear outside because it does help avoid these types of problems. Often I garden, or read a book, or work in my journal, so I am not directly involved in active play. Other times I take the active role and ride bikes too and get to know the other kids. My presence completely changes the dynamics, and really, I have gotten to enjoy this role, it helps my son feel safe and I have gotten to know the kids dynamics on a real level.<br/>
<br/>
Her parents do need to know what is going on and maybe they need help too, so finding a way to be a helpful neighbor, concerned, and open might help. Maybe as a whole neighborhood, coming together, with kindness for the child. Also, letting the child know clearly when they have crossed the safety boundries. I find I can comunicate very well with the neighbor kids because I have gotten to know them. Also, maybe invite her over when you have total time to focus, do something fun together to help her have successful visits.<br/>
<br/>
When she was on the tram, were you watching to see what she did to get thrown out? I bet, if she is at all like my son, she may have challenged herself to get thrown out. I like the contract, but if her family is as you allude, she&#39;ll probably just get in trouble for even being on a tramp. <br/>
<br/>
One other approach, if you know any of the mom&#39;s with kids in school, have them talk with her teacher to see what might be up. The girl who was wild here (they moved) was on a very high level of ritalin and on bipolar meds and I got info about her from a teacher friend which helped me interact with her. When I saw K getting way out of bounds, I knew she was choosing to come off her meds without her parents knowing and it made me way more compassionate towards her. Often what K needed was direct adult 1 on 1 interaction, so if we were outside, I would engage her in dialogue and she would talk a mile a minute and all the kids could play without K doing, saying something inappropriate. And we sent just her home sometimes, because my son could not tolerate her when she got out of control.<br/>
<br/>
My thoughts and stories from similar situation here. My son is 9 and I still stay outside and watch him play with anyone. It just is what works for his own safety. It is not an optional thing.<br/>

*********<br/>
 <br/>
Mary, I have mulled over what you are saying.  I agree with you, but I  <br/>
realize I just cannot do it at this time.  My own life is overwhelming to  me and <br/>
I&#39;ve got much bigger issues to deal with.  This is why is was so  wonderful <br/>
that my children could finally play outside without me sitting right  there!  I <br/>
just need time to focus on other things....seriously.....not just  &quot;me time&quot;.  <br/>
The stable future of my family depends on it.  <br/>
 <br/>
I am keeping my fingers crossed that she will be leaving for the summer in  <br/>
the next few days.  If not, I will have to keep working on another plan,  like <br/>
limiting her time here to an hour.<br/>
 <br/>
BTW, she has lived in my neighborhood for 18 months.  In that time,  several <br/>
compassionate neighbors had been trying to do as you suggested.   She <br/>
eventually wore them out and they will now only allow Ally limited time with  their <br/>
own children.  It is easier for them as they are really busy with  after school <br/>
activities that keep them away from home.  <br/>
 <br/>
More reason to move to acreage in the middle of nowhere!!!<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks everybody.<br/>
