<div id="ygrps-yiv-1485654905">Dear Amazing Unschoolers,<br/>
   <br/>
  I am new at this and I am trying to find out how I can unschool my son and be in compliance with the law.  Do I have to go through a school here in my town.  Last year I homeschooled and we were associated with a local charter school.  We used their book and did the typical curriculum - it didn&#39;t go so well.  He had to report in every 6 weeks and show his progress and had to take all state tests, etc.<br/>
   <br/>
  I asked his teacher if he had heard of unschooling and he seemed familiar but wasn&#39;t comfortable getting involved with it.  My son just finished his first week back at school and doesn&#39;t want to go back - so now I have to inform his teacher that he wants out but I am hesitant to state that we are going to unschool instead of homeschool.<br/>
   <br/>
  Help - any suggestions and or information regarding CA law??<br/>
   <br/>
  Very truly yours,<br/>
   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1854048203">If you do option one, you don&#39;t have to do anything except file an  <br/>
annual affidavit. You aren&#39;t connected to any schools or use their  <br/>
books. That&#39;s just for any homeschooler. It seems to me that  <br/>
unschooling would be supremely easy. Do not ask teachers about  <br/>
homeschooling, they generally have no idea of the law.<br/>
visit www.hslda.org for legal information<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-185820946">You can go to www.hsc.org or www.CaliforniaHomeschoool.net to get the <br/>
details on the various ways to homeschool in California.  The option <br/>
that will give you the most flexibility is declaring your own private <br/>
school.  It&#39;s not as hard as it sounds; the paperwork is quite <br/>
minimal.  You might also consider joining the CA-Homeschooling-HSC <br/>
yahoo group to ask any questions you may have.<br/>

I saw replies, but haven&#39;t read them yet. I&#39;m in CA and unschooling and  it&#39;s <br/>
no different law-wise than any other form of homeschooling. <br/>
 <br/>
Where are you located? I&#39;m in Claremont...the easternmost LA County :) <br/>

the inclusive statewide groups for information.<br/>
For California, a great site is &lt;www.HSC.org&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
You can be a private school - there is NO oversight or reporting about  <br/>
your kids. There are LOTS of unschoolers here in California.<br/>

That&#39;s what I did - I have the &quot;private school&quot; here. <br/>

Where are you all? Maybe we can connect in person. <br/>
