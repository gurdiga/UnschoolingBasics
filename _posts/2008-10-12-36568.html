<div id="ygrps-yiv-2023058841">This caught me eye. It reminds me of the admonitions that we should all eat dinner together.<br/>
<br/>
No thanks. I&#39;ve been with the kids all day and they don&#39;t want to watch the news program I want to watch while eating. <br/>
<br/>
Now, if I hadn&#39;t seen them all day that might be another thing.<br/>
<br/>
And about projects -- I love the way my DD wants to do projects. But I often don&#39;t know anything about the thing she wants to do. Today&#39;s question was, &quot;Mom, how do you make perfume?&quot; Picture me with a blank look on my face. <br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s OK. I just said I didn&#39;t know and she&#39;d have to look it up. She did. Then I helped a tiny, tiny bit with finding the right container and figuring out what supplies we had. She&#39;s doing it all on her own now -- doing something violent sounding to lilac flowers :) -- and will keep me updated, ask for help if she needs it and is happy to be doing her thing.<br/>
<br/>
And so was I. I actually sewed something today. How incredibly crafty -- for me anyway. :)<br/>

There&#39;s an implication, there, that parents have to create projects <br/>
or make a special effort to spend time with children. Its an <br/>
expectation that comes from more conventional parenting, where kid <br/>
life is largely separate from adult life.<br/>
