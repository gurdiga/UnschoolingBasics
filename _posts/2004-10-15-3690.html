<div id="ygrps-yiv-1764329168">I just added this to my groups to visit (with encouragement from the <br/>
AlwaysUnschooled list). So, here&#39;s my intro:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Deb aka Bugsmom on most boards (the soggyboysmom is an old <br/>
screen name on yahoo that I just never bothered changing). I work <br/>
fulltime as a software tester for a CAD/CAM software developer. DH <br/>
is Rick, an at home dad and great cook. DS, my boy bug, is Joshua. <br/>
He turned 6 in June. We&#39;re up in CT where homeschooling is <br/>
unregulated :-) DS has never been to school.</div>
