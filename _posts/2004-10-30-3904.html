<div id="ygrps-yiv-2145666369">I am kind of confused.  I tried to change to the digest version both here and at unschooling basics and I am still getting every email.  Then over at unschooling basics, I clicked on NO EMAIL and I still get every message in my inbox.  it says it&#39;s been updated but it&#39;s not working.  Do I need to unsubscribe and resubscibe to make it go?<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for your help!<br/>

I have had that happen on a couple of lists.  I would wait a few days  first. <br/>
 Sometimes it takes Yahoo a few days to catch up to your request,  even <br/>
though it says that your preferences have been updated.  <br/>
