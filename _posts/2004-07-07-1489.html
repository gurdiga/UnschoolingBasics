<div id="ygrps-yiv-2016742503">A couple of women in my playgroup have had pinatas where they put 5 or six groups of identical things per kid -- e.g. 10 green straws, 10 reece&#39;s cups, 10 red plastic whistles, etc.  Both times we have done this, after the pinata was broken, the kids seemed ot have a lot of fun figuring out who had picked up what and making sure that everyone had one of everything.  FWIW these are kids from a close group who have know each other for years, so that might have made a difference. <br/>

   That&#39;s a good idea, too.  What I did with our pinata is put the candy  <br/>
  pre-sorted into containers inside the pinata, just enough for everyone at the  <br/>
  party.  <br/>
