<div id="ygrps-yiv-1021920054">How do you guys handle &quot;arguments&quot; or disagreements between your <br/>
children.  Just a little while ago my 10 year old was being really rude <br/>
to my 6 year old and it is very hard to just sit by and &quot;allow&quot; it to <br/>
continue.  It&#39;s never a physical thing, but the words that flow from <br/>
their lips can be so incredibly hateful.  I think I&#39;m mainly struggling <br/>
with it being a sort of &quot;bully&quot; situation since the 10 year old is so <br/>
much more mentally &quot;mature&quot; than the 6 year old.<br/>
<br/>
I do not talk to the kids, or anyone else, the way they talk to each <br/>
other when they are mad, btw!!!  I don&#39;t want the kids to feel like <br/>
they cannot express their emotions, but I also don&#39;t want them to <br/>
verbally abuse each other!  <br/>
<br/>
So, do you step in?  Do you talk to the kids individually or together?  <br/>
What do you do when your kids &quot;fight&quot;?</div>

anything treat each other harshly.<br/>
<br/>
I often speak to them quietly and personally. I try and help them <br/>
review what happened so they can get clear on it. Then I ask how they <br/>
felt about it. Often they will have had time to cool down and they <br/>
will unprompted offer and apology to the other.<br/>
<br/>
I have two of my kids who seem to often end up in a power sort of <br/>
thing. It is really hard on me. I have also owned this with them.<br/>
<br/>
With those two especially I will watch for signs of them getting on <br/>
each others nerves and try to get them in seperate areas of the <br/>
house. In a redirecting sort of way. Like I&#39;ll see if someone wants <br/>
to help me in the kitchen, or a game of cards, or a walk. Or <br/>
sometimes icecream. Remember this is just when I sense that they are <br/>
wearing on each other. I also watch for tired, hungry or stressed in <br/>
my kids because it is those things that make me lash out. <br/>
<br/>
Those are just several ideas and probably none of them new to you. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1934231619">Thank you, Kathleen!  I am quite familiar with those things and I do <br/>
thank you for your reply.  I want to stay out of it when possible, but <br/>
it definitely bothers me when my kids treat each other badly.  I know <br/>
it can&#39;t feel &quot;good&quot; to them!  I know I don&#39;t want to be controlling <br/>
with them and their experiences, so it&#39;s good to hear what others do to <br/>
head-off a heated exchange without being a controlling parent!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>
