<div id="ygrps-yiv-1688903415">This quarter I&#39;m all set, as we did enough Saxon Math to be able to report<br/>
it on the QR.  But Math is largely why I&#39;ve decided to unschool.  It clearly<br/>
doesn&#39;t work for him.  Despite quickly getting concepts (I tried to explain<br/>
to him that I can tell that he almost has a concept by watching his face as<br/>
he thinks about it.  I think he thought I was nuts ;-) ), he believes he is<br/>
&quot;dumb at math&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;ve totally left Math alone for the past few weeks.  Well, okay, I<br/>
screwed up and in a panic as I was preparing my QR last week, asked him to<br/>
go over a few things we were supposed to have covered.  It went pretty well,<br/>
and if he got upset, we stopped.  But in thinking about this quarter, I<br/>
really don&#39;t know how to approach math.  I just tried to have a discussion<br/>
with him about it this morning, b/c it came up.  We went to a Festival<br/>
yesterday, and he found this wooden box he wanted that costs $22.  This<br/>
morning, he had found the box of quarters and other change that we had set<br/>
aside for school purposes.  So, I suggested that we use the change to figure<br/>
out how much change he could expect if he purchased the box.  I could tell<br/>
that he understood it, but he started getting upset, doing his twitching on<br/>
the floor, distraction with the dog, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I asked him a bit later why he thought I hadn&#39;t been bringing up math and<br/>
&quot;school&quot; the past few weeks.  He said he thought it was because I was &quot;busy&quot;<br/>
:-(  I explained to him that no, I really want him to learn what he wants,<br/>
at his own pace, but that honestly I am worried b/c there are expectations<br/>
of what I am supposed to cover.  I briefly read him some things from the<br/>
worldbook standards for math.  I&#39;m honestly not too worried about the other<br/>
subjects b/c he naturally wants to learn about science, loves books, is<br/>
interested in history, etc.  So reporting them is merely an issue of being<br/>
organized enough to keep track.<br/>
<br/>
I just don&#39;t know how to unschool math and still meet district<br/>
requirements.  I live in NY, btw, which I&#39;ve heard mention as one of the<br/>
most difficult states to unschool in and the Curriculum Director has been on<br/>
my case pretty much every step of the way, so she&#39;s not one to let anything<br/>
slide.<br/>
<br/>
I have a feeling that there is another list that was mentioned as more<br/>
appropriate for that aspect, but honestly, I&#39;ve joined so many lists lately<br/>
I can&#39;t keep track.  I know this list would be appropriate for the basic<br/>
question, which is how do I meet requirements but still unschool math and<br/>
thus have him feel good about learning?  I know that expectations can get<br/>
you in trouble, but I guess I do have a desire at least for him to enjoy our<br/>
time together and I honestly don&#39;t see any issue with that.  I also have<br/>
externally imposed expectations that I can&#39;t control.  And I feel personally<br/>
stressed about it, which will spill over if I don&#39;t nip it in the bud.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas welcome.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A NY list would probably be more helpful for you in terms of meeting <br/>
specific requirements. I don&#39;t live in NY, but what I do for Ray&#39;s <br/>
mom is to observe what Ray does and &quot;translate&quot; that into schoolish <br/>
language so that she feels good about his &quot;education&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
So, for instance, a couple weeks ago I gave her a list of &quot;courses&quot; <br/>
(and forgot to keep a copy! I&#39;m still kicking myself). Top of the <br/>
list was &quot;shop&quot;. We happen to have a woodshop and Ray likes to dabble <br/>
now and then. So its a convenient way to talk about how he&#39;s learning <br/>
all about measurement and fractions and angles, blah blah blah... and <br/>
if we really need to (or she decides to grill Ray) we can pull out <br/>
samples of projects to show her. If we were reporting this to a state <br/>
agency, we&#39;d probably take digital pix and keep a &quot;folder&quot; of them <br/>
with notes for some kind of portfolio review. <br/>
<br/>
Okay, you have a 7yo, not a 15yo, so lets see if I can find something <br/>
from *my* 7yo&#39;s life... This morning she got her train set out! Oh, <br/>
that&#39;s a cakewalk... what&#39;s something harder? The hamser. Okay, so <br/>
she has a hamster and one of these balls so he can run around the <br/>
floor and not be stepped on or eaten by cats. She likes to play games <br/>
where she sets up obstacles for the hamster - so she has to estimate <br/>
the size of the ball and the amount of force the little guy can exert <br/>
to get over and through different kinds of spaces. So there&#39;s <br/>
estimation, measurement, geometry. Periodically he knocks things <br/>
over - probability, number theory, counting, addition, <br/>
multiplication, subtraction. <br/>
<br/>
If I were to report this to anyone I&#39;d take some pix and write short <br/>
descriptions. I know the lingo - I used to tutor math - which helps <br/>
me alot. It might help you to look through some math books from the <br/>
perspective of learning the language you need to *talk* about math.<br/>
<br/>
Is there an &quot;umbrella school&quot; option in your area? If so, if you can <br/>
find one that&#39;s more compatible with unschooling it will make your <br/>
life sooooo much easier. We&#39;re umbrella&#39;d through The Farm - the old <br/>
hippie place in Summertown TN. I don&#39;t think its a valid umbrella <br/>
school outside TN, more&#39;s the pity, but they&#39;re very supportive of <br/>
unschooling. Some of the more intensely Christian umbrella schools <br/>
are also compatible with unschooling in the sense that they don&#39;t ask <br/>
too many questions about specifics - worth looking into if this is an <br/>
option for you.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You might want to do some research on your own - there&#39;s quite a bit <br/>
of math in science and history, too. Even literature, although you&#39;d <br/>
have to be more creative to figure out how to report that. Check some <br/>
curriculum resources that include biographies of mathematicians and <br/>
scientists... that sort of thing. Not so much for him as for you. <br/>
Montessori sources might also have useful information for you - some <br/>
of those curricula have options for teaching math *via* other <br/>
subjects. Again, I&#39;m not suggesting it for him, but to give you some <br/>
ideas of how to report the very real math he *is* learning - part of <br/>
the challenge is that you have to learn to *see* it and &quot;translate&quot; <br/>
into terms the state will recognize. <br/>
