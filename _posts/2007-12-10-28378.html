&gt; student. She takes initiative, pays attention to the schedule, checks in<br/>
&gt; with the teacher when she needs something, proceeds on her own when she<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t. I get many compliments (nice for the Mom :) ) and I get to explain<br/>
&gt; to the teachers that it&#39;s really not so much me as years of her learning to<br/>
&gt; be in charge of her own learning and time that result in a person who can do<br/>
&gt; these things.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; These are online middle school-level classes she is taking, not college.<br/>
&gt; But I think she&#39;ll be fine if she decides to go to college.<br/>
