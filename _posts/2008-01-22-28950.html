<div id="ygrps-yiv-396565590">i get emails from modernmom.com- i actually read this one because it <br/>
mentioned homeschooling  in the subject line. it goes on to mention <br/>
unschooling as  organic learning.<br/>
&quot; Some simply `unschool&#39;, which is essentially where children learn <br/>
organically, through daily life, and don&#39;t use any curriculum or work <br/>
books. &quot;<br/>
 its a good article to send some skeptics to  the whole idea of <br/>
homeschooling.<br/>
