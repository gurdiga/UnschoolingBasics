Reading, writing and playing The Sims<br/>
<br/>
What video games can teach educators about improving our schools<br/>
<br/>
Marco Visscher | September 2006 issue<br/>
<br/>
The door closes with a squeak and a creak. Oh no! Is it locked? Let’s <br/>
check… No, thank God, you can open it… So now, another go at getting to <br/>
the ladder. Maybe through this narrow hallway? … No, it’s a dead end.<br/>
<br/>
Fifteen children between the ages of 9 and 11 are staring at the <br/>
computer screen, mesmerized, as the adventure game Myst III: Exile is <br/>
played. In the middle of the group sits Tim Rylands, the most popular <br/>
teacher at the small elementary school Chew Magna, in the village of <br/>
the same name near the English city of Bristol. Once more he manuevers <br/>
his cordless mouse to guide the cursor along the dark walls of a hollow <br/>
mountainside. Rylands then tells his students, “Okay, now write down <br/>
which way we should go to get to the ladder. What do you come across? <br/>
What do you experience on your journey?” The only sound heard is the <br/>
furious scribbling of pens.<br/>
<br/>
Rylands has found a way to make writing fun for kids. Myst is a <br/>
beautifully designed series of computer games set on a mysterious <br/>
deserted island that can be endlessly navigated. According to Rylands, <br/>
the visually rich landscape inspires his students’ creativity.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He can back up that claim with data. An average of 75 percent of <br/>
English children between the ages of 9 and 11 reach so-called “level <br/>
four literacy levels” in reading and writing (including spelling, <br/>
grammar, vocabulary, etc.). At Chew Magna, that percentage stood at 77 <br/>
in 2000, rising to 93 four years later after Rylands began using <br/>
computers to help teach writing. Boys in particular, who normally score <br/>
lower in these areas, have made tremendous progress. One hundred <br/>
percent reach level four, compared to 67 percent in 2000.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Nolan Bushnell wishes his children had a teacher like Tim Rylands. “The <br/>
digital life in which kids live today is turned off at school. That <br/>
leaves them with boredom and frustration. A man in front of a <br/>
blackboard with a piece of chalk is just very boring.”<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Bushnell should know. He watched as his eight children became <br/>
increasingly alienated in the U.S. educational system. He believes <br/>
schools and teachers haven’t sufficiently adjusted to changes in the <br/>
world around them. Young people should not be memorizing facts or <br/>
spending long hours on multiple-choice tests, says Bushnell, but <br/>
learning to think, analyze, make connections. These are the talents <br/>
that more than ever are rewarded in this new century, he says.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Bushnell also sees a solution for the educational system—the very idea <br/>
Tim Rylands is already putting into practise: using video and computer <br/>
games to inspire learning. He’s an expert in the field. Back in 1972, <br/>
Nolan Bushnell founded Atari, the pioneering computer company. As the <br/>
creator of classics like Pong—remember the Ping-Pong game between two <br/>
discs on opposite sides of the screen?—Bushnell is generally recognized <br/>
as “the father of the game industry.”<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And because he is also the father of a 12-year-old son who can <br/>
distinguish between 200 different Pokémon characters (“If they were <br/>
plant and animal species, he would be able to pass sophomore biology”), <br/>
Bushnell now spreads the word about how video games can help kids <br/>
learn. Games, he asserts, teach you creative problem-solving. They <br/>
teach you to formulate hypotheses (“First I have to get the key from <br/>
the magician so I can open the door”), to test these hypotheses (“Game <br/>
over”) and revise them (“Oh no, I have to drink my elixir to get to the <br/>
magician!”). Games can even teach you the fundamental principles of <br/>
scientific research.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Back at Chew Magna school, Tim Rylands believes his students are <br/>
learning more than writing skills. “While going through a game, <br/>
children listen and talk,” he explains as the classroom empties. “They <br/>
discuss. They explore. It’s like going on a school trip, but this is a <br/>
lot cheaper, and it saves on insurance premiums,” he jokes.<br/>
<br/>
Many people envision that the school of the future—and Bushnell would <br/>
love to open one himself—doesn’t use books as its primary teaching <br/>
materials, but video games.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In the words of another game developer, Marc Prensky, who wrote Digital <br/>
Game-Based Learning: “Because schools haven’t adapted to the world <br/>
their students know and live in, they simply get bored in the <br/>
classroom. They tune out. You can get engagement, even among apathetic <br/>
students, simply because games are constructed in a way so players want <br/>
to finish the level. Games offer players the chance to make decisions, <br/>
get feedback, level up and become heroes. That’s how education should <br/>
be organized. You learn more and more, you apply that knowledge, and <br/>
you’ll get a great job.”<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Computer games have already become part of the lesson plans in some <br/>
schools. But these are usually simple games for elementary-school <br/>
children. They use bright colours and amusing sounds to make math or <br/>
spelling “fun.” But these only take the edge off the age-old practise <br/>
of rote learning. This is not the type of game-based education Bushnell <br/>
and Prensky advocate.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Teachers like Tim Rylands (who won a teaching award last year from <br/>
BECTA, the British government’s partner in the development and delivery <br/>
of its Internet-based learning strategy for schools, for his use of <br/>
Myst) who have found ways to include exciting games in their teaching <br/>
materials continue to be the exceptions. Some progressive secondary <br/>
schools use SimCity (a simulation game in which you build cities) and <br/>
Civilization (a strategy game that involves building a complete <br/>
civilization).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But supporters of the video-game industry—a $28 billion business in <br/>
which annual sales in the U.S. now outstrip the Hollywood box <br/>
office—see an opportunity to develop products tailored to schools. The <br/>
number of games designed for educational or other purposes beyond play <br/>
is a new, growing sector of the industry.<br/>
<br/>
One example is a game recently developed by the United Nations called <br/>
Food Force, in which young people learn about hunger issues by leading <br/>
their own virtual food-aid campaign. It’s now common in the corporate <br/>
world to use computer and video games as part of refresher courses in <br/>
numerous fields. And public-health officials are exploring the <br/>
possibilities of games that encourage good health (see “Watch out for <br/>
that cancer cell!” page XX).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In Got Game: How the Gamer Generation Is Reshaping Business Forever <br/>
(Harvard Business School Press, 2004), two organizational-development <br/>
consultants explain that gamers are, in fact, ideal employees. They <br/>
take more risks, react better to disappointments or mistakes, are open <br/>
to the possibility that their plan may need to be adjusted and strive <br/>
for excellence and promotions. Surprisingly, they also work better in <br/>
teams—perhaps because of their experience working toward the same goal <br/>
with others when they are playing computer games.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Many other people, of course, line up on the other side of the issue <br/>
and their arguments are well known: The only thing kids learn from <br/>
computer games is how to stare at a screen for hours. They’re not using <br/>
their brains and imaginations, just a few tendons in their fingers to <br/>
operate the joystick. A salient detail: Most gamers are under the age <br/>
of 40, while most critics are older and have rarely played the games <br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Parents are concerned that video games will make their children violent <br/>
or uncommunicative. They get a lot of backing from vote-seeking <br/>
politicians who voice their disgust with the violence and sexism seen <br/>
in games. The media tend to focus on extreme examples like Grand Theft <br/>
Auto, in which the player is a criminal who must survive by breaking <br/>
into cars, robbing people and running over hapless pedestrians, and <br/>
gets bonus points for killing cops. While arguably justified in such <br/>
cases, the fear surrounding video games makes it difficult to look at <br/>
the reality. The fact is that both youth crime and violent crime in <br/>
Western countries has fallen spectacularly over the past 10 years as <br/>
video-game popularity has risen. If video games inspire aggression, it <br/>
is not reflected in the figures.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, the shooting games are not the most popular. Usually, only <br/>
one or two violent titles rank among the top 10 best-selling games. The <br/>
Progress %amp% Freedom Foundation, a liberal think tank in Washington, <br/>
calculated that over 80 percent of the most popular video and computer <br/>
games of the past five years were rated “E” for everyone or “T” for <br/>
“teen,” i.e. they are not particularly violent.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There is also the concern that young people will become isolated by <br/>
playing video games. But many games, particularly those played on the <br/>
computer or the Internet, are designed for teams. Kid’s social lives <br/>
have changed a lot over the last 20 years, when few households had <br/>
computers. Kids relied more on reading (certainly an isolating pursuit) <br/>
and gamers were often lonely outsiders. But today, gaming is a very <br/>
normal activity for most young people. In fact, nowadays a kid who’s <br/>
never played Nintendo or PlayStation is considered odd and often can’t <br/>
relate to others about an important leisure activity.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What is hard to grasp for those who aren’t familiar with video <br/>
games—people who grew up playing chess and Scrabble—is that these new <br/>
games invite creativity, promote problem-solving abilities and inspire <br/>
perseverance. As Marc Prensky points out, it can take up to 100 hours <br/>
to complete a video game: “This is not just biding time on a rainy <br/>
day.” Games stimulate the development of self-confidence and social <br/>
contact with others. For people who have never experienced the <br/>
sensation of reaching the final moment of the role-playing game Deus Ex <br/>
(for which there are three possible endings!), these positive aspects <br/>
are difficult to fathom—just as it’s hard to understand what’s so great <br/>
about golf if you have never played it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The best-selling computer game ever, The Sims, which has sold 6 million <br/>
copies worldwide, is a simulation game (hence, The Sims) that allows <br/>
you to control the lives of virtual characters. The Sims must spend <br/>
enough time on education, physical activities, hygiene, eating and <br/>
sleeping or they get sick. Players learn that you need to work to buy <br/>
things, that you can earn more money if you spend time on personal <br/>
development and social contacts and that you get depressed if your <br/>
“pleasure meter” is empty. That’s a far cry from a round of Parcheesi.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Games are interesting because they’re difficult. That is the essential <br/>
message the world of game culture offers to education: Learning is fun <br/>
when it’s intellectually stimulating. James Paul Gee, a professor of <br/>
educational learning sciences at the University of Wisconsin as well as <br/>
a fervent gamer and author of What Video Games Have to Teach Us About <br/>
Learning and Literacy, explains it this way: “The game industry is <br/>
selling products that are complex and hard to master, and take a lot of <br/>
time to master. The fact that people are buying them contradicts the <br/>
idea that everything should be fast and easy. In fact, a game that is <br/>
too easy will get criticized in reviews and will not become a success. <br/>
A game should be challenging, fair and deep. If it’s not, it won’t <br/>
sell.”<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The insight that games are—in Ryland’s words—“mind-expanding” rather <br/>
than “mind-numbing” has not (yet) reached school curriculum developers. <br/>
They continue to battle apathy among young people by trying to make <br/>
teaching materials more fun and presenting them in bite-sized bits so <br/>
they’re easier to digest. It doesn’t appear to be working. Kids are <br/>
still bored in class. Teachers shake their heads, complain about the <br/>
zap culture and the youth of today who can’t keep their focus on <br/>
anything, say that kids are quickly distracted and can’t sit still. But <br/>
if you put these bored kids in front of a PlayStation, they’ll remain <br/>
focused for hours. What happened to the short attention spans? Where’s <br/>
the apathy?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Video games support the great gift that young people possess to learn <br/>
by themselves. Games call on their natural need to develop themselves, <br/>
to feel masterful and competent. When they taste that thrill of <br/>
possibility, it can bring feelings of pleasure and pride. Anyone who <br/>
has played Legend of Zelda or Morrowind knows what it’s like to <br/>
complete the game at last after many lengthy periods of frustration.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In this context, video games present a radically different vision of <br/>
education: kids who are able to learn by themselves. Even when schools <br/>
fail, students actively look for ways to learn. Experts don’t need to <br/>
impose an education program to tap into that innate need.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Making History is a good example of a computer game especially <br/>
developed for education that fulfils young people’s requirements for <br/>
quality and challenging entertainment. The game is used to teach the <br/>
history of World War II. Even before our meeting in Boston, Nick <br/>
deKanter, co-founder and vice president of Muzzy Lane Software, throws <br/>
out a challenge. “Does the game simplify history? Why don’t you play <br/>
first and ask me later?”<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
DeKanter is right. Making History: The Calm and the Storm sketches a <br/>
simplified image of a particular moment in human history. During the <br/>
game you take on the role of a head of state who leads his country <br/>
based on historical events and data. You have to make decisions (on <br/>
spending, trading partners, military strategies and much more) as well <br/>
as conduct negotiations with other government leaders. Military, <br/>
diplomatic and economic advisers are built into the game and prompt you <br/>
at crucial moments. The instruction booklet is 58 pages long.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
David McDivitt, a history teacher at Oak Hill High School in the U.S. <br/>
state of Indiana, uses the game. His research shows that the students <br/>
who didn’t read textbooks or attend classes but played and discussed <br/>
Making History learned more about World War II than students in other <br/>
classes. Moreover, answers to essay questions in the classes <br/>
exclusively using the game were more reflective and better reasoned.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But what most struck McDivitt was that his students talked about the <br/>
game outside the classroom. “There were conversations about game <br/>
scenarios spilling out in the hallways, the lunch room and even after <br/>
school,” he notes, “with some kids coming in after 3 wanting another <br/>
turn! Once I heard someone say: ‘Hey dude, you weren’t supposed to <br/>
invade my country, we had a defence agreement!’ Extracurricular <br/>
conversations about the politics of leadership are not something I <br/>
typically see after reading a chapter of a textbook.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
DeKanter agrees. “A textbook is much better than a video game at <br/>
delivering names and dates,” he explains. “But in today’s world, data <br/>
is available anywhere on the Internet. What’s more important now than <br/>
learning names and data are the skills to analyze that data and to <br/>
apply information to gain insight and make decisions. In the <br/>
Information Age it’s all about connecting the dots—and games are, much <br/>
more than books, extremely good at helping students learn this.”<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But he is also realistic. “People learn from other people, not from <br/>
machines. That’s why games should never be played in a vacuum, and they <br/>
should never be used as a babysitter. A game needs to be introduced and <br/>
evaluated. Have students write a paper on how they performed in the <br/>
game and what they learned. I don’t see games as a replacement for <br/>
textbooks, but as a valuable enhancement.”<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Atari founder Nolan Bushnell disagrees. He would love to set up a <br/>
private school at which children learn through games. Textbooks would <br/>
not be used. “We don’t need books,” he says decidedly. “Sure, kids need <br/>
to read, but not necessarily books. Books are obsolete.” The restaurant <br/>
chain he is currently developing as part of his new company uWink (see <br/>
“Playing together,” page XX) could be a good model for his school; <br/>
there, small groups sit around tables playing stimulating games <br/>
surrounded by walls onto which facts and data are projected.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But won’t educational games always lose out to their commercial <br/>
equivalents purely focused on entertainment? “That’s not the <br/>
competition here,” Bushnell replies. “Educational games are competing <br/>
against the boring teacher in the front of the class who is just not <br/>
capable of engaging his students.”<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The resistance to games shows all the signs of a ritual conflict <br/>
between generations. At one time, rock ’n’ roll was thought to have a <br/>
clearly negative influence: Parents, preachers and politicians thought <br/>
it changed young people into—according to one U.S. preacher—“devil <br/>
worshippers” who defied both the law and common decency. Further back, <br/>
jazz and even the waltz were criticized as corrupting influences, as <br/>
were novels, comic books and movies—all said to dull the minds of young <br/>
people. In retrospect, I think we can all agree those influences <br/>
weren’t so bad.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
More to the point, we currently consider books a higher form of <br/>
culture, but one of history’s most eminent philosophers, Socrates, was <br/>
a declared opponent of reading. Books would render people forgetful, he <br/>
claimed. According to Plato’s Phaedrus, Socrates believed you shouldn’t <br/>
even write down a speech because the written word always provides “one <br/>
unvarying answer.” This recently led The Economist to suggest that <br/>
Socrates was criticizing books’ lack of interactivity and that if alive <br/>
today he might be a champion of video games.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It is evident that digital culture has society ever more firmly in its <br/>
grasp. It is clear that computers and the Internet are creating endless <br/>
new opportunities. And it is inevitable that this powerful cultural <br/>
influence won’t stop at the classroom door. Standard classroom <br/>
teaching, from which Tim Rylands’ students momentarily escape when Myst <br/>
is played, would appear to be better suited to a time when young people <br/>
were being prepared to work in an economy based on factories and mass <br/>
production. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It doesn’t take a lot of insight to recognize that the modern economy <br/>
requires very different talents—talents that may not be fully developed <br/>
using traditional textbooks. The advance of video games into classroom <br/>
education, therefore, is not only unavoidable; it is necessary.</div>
