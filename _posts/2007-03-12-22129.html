<div id="ygrps-yiv-1094397520">I suspect if you listed all the things your 3 or 4 or whatever age<br/>
(I&#39;m assuming you have a little one?) knows right now, you might be<br/>
impressed.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you look at those lists, there are SOME commonalities, but<br/>
there are some very huge differences, because they are that person&#39;s<br/>
(or committee&#39;s) opinion of what that age/grade should know.  Recently<br/>
a friend told me that the charter school in our state doesn&#39;t accept<br/>
Math U See because it doesn&#39;t meet state standards -- &quot;Well, they<br/>
don&#39;t even introduce money until third grade!&quot;  Well, what 5 yr old<br/>
needs a book to learn about money?  &quot;Grandpa gave me this quarter!&quot;  I<br/>
remember my niece at age 5, just lost a tooth, told us, &quot;I&#39;ll put it<br/>
under my pillow and the tooth fairy will take it and leave a nickel or<br/>
a quarter, or a dollar!&quot;  (And my bil said, &quot;Or a nickel.&quot;)  I think<br/>
she had the concept of money down pretty well!<br/>
<br/>
Knowing how to read -- what are they discussing?  Reading readiness<br/>
skills, or reading?  What level?  Etc.  Some kids learn to read by<br/>
four, but most don&#39;t.  If they want to learn to read, fine.  But I<br/>
remember the K my son went to (private) &quot;taught&quot; the kids to read.  My<br/>
son was reading before then, one boy wasn&#39;t.  All the kids came home<br/>
with a dippy &quot;I learned to read in Kindergarten&quot; thingie, but the next<br/>
year one mother said her son hadn&#39;t learned to read, really.  So, what<br/>
measure do you use to define reading?<br/>
<br/>
Math?  It is a very natural, integrated part of life, despite the fact<br/>
that people get scared by the word often.<br/>
<br/>
History and language arts are VERY content driven, so how on earth can<br/>
anyone say what a certain age/grade &quot;should&quot; know?<br/>
<br/>
And who ever said that all children do exactly the same thing at the<br/>
same time.  There is a normal range that walking begins, but if you<br/>
don&#39;t have a walker by age one, it doesn&#39;t mean you have a problem. <br/>
Just someone who isn&#39;t ready to walk yet.  My son couldn&#39;t make the<br/>
long E sound until 17 months.  Just a quirk of his wiring.  No &quot;long<br/>
E&quot; lessons were ever needed, nor suggested.  Yet expecting a child to<br/>
read at 4?  It&#39;s not only okay to wait until they are ready, 6 or<br/>
whenever, it&#39;s generally a good idea.  <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t bother whacking your head on a brick wall over this -- those<br/>
things aren&#39;t worth it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2058245582">I just pulled my 5 yo out of K because she was not learning her letters <br/>
FAST enough or how to read yet.(she knows all her letters she is just <br/>
VERY shy and needs to connect to be verbal, so she won&#39;t TELL the <br/>
teacher she knows them therefore, she doesn&#39;t know them PS at it&#39;s <br/>
best?) They act like she will be illiterate if she doesn&#39;t read soon. <br/>
Whatever. My 13 yo read 2 weeks into K she was also older, my 5 yo <br/>
turned 5 two weeks after school started, my 13 yo was reading on a <br/>
third grade reading level in 1st grade, by 4th grade she was on a 4th <br/>
grade level, whatever a 3rd, 4th etc reading level is, I wish I would <br/>
have known about the options for my state when she was in first grade, <br/>
so I could have saved her those labels and all in PS, I pulled her out <br/>
after 5th grade. She says she will never go back to public school <br/>
again, that is music to my ears. When I told my 5 yo she was a <br/>
homeschooler like her sister, she was SOOO happy. I regret ever bending <br/>
to family pressure to send her to K. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-882028785">Heavens, in a Waldorf school, many children don�t start learning to read<br/>
until 7!  Research backs up �later� reading as better.  I�ll see if I<br/>
can find it if you want it.  Relax and go with the needs and natural<br/>
interests of your child, although, on a personal note, don�t be afraid<br/>
to push just a little when they get frustrated.  If frustration<br/>
continues into a battle between you and your child, it�s time to let it<br/>
go, IMO.  <br/>

Could you elaborate on that? Because when my child is frustrated, I<br/>
either stay close by to support if needed (as they figure out if they<br/>
are going to work through their own frustration with an activity or<br/>
stop) and/or help if asked. Pushing is the last thing I&#39;d want to do<br/>
with a frustrated child.<br/>
<br/>
And we&#39;re talking about reading ability, correct? Why would an<br/>
unschooling parent need to &quot;push a little&quot;?  If one is to &quot;relax and<br/>
go with the needs and natural interests of your child&quot; then pushing is<br/>
contradictory to that philosophy.<br/>

her to finish what she started, or that giving up when the going gets<br/>
rough is ok.  Help me if I�m wrong, here.  I usually feel the situation<br/>
out.  For example, she needed to write a �thank you� note for birthday<br/>
presents the other day.  This is part of how we�re learning to write.<br/>
She copies what I�ve written (a sentence) and will sometimes get<br/>

<br/>
    I guess I’m not a pure unschooler, then!  Perhaps I have more to <br/>
learn.<br/>
It seems to me that if I don’t insist that my daughter finish something<br/>
(as long as there’s just a bit more to do, not a lot), I’m not teaching<br/>
her to finish what she started, or that giving up when the going gets<br/>
rough is ok.  Help me if I’m wrong, here.  I usually feel the situation<br/>
out.  For example, she needed to write a “thank you” note for birthday<br/>
presents the other day.  This is part of how we’re learning to write.<br/>
She copies what I’ve written (a sentence) and will sometimes get<br/>
frustrated at the number of letters in the sentence.  So, she can finish<br/>
part of the letter and start afresh the next day.<br/>
<br/>
Your thoughts?<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Melissa, You&#39;ll be getting a LOT of thoughts on this one. Are you ready?<br/>
<br/>
What you&#39;re teaching and what she&#39;s learning are two completely <br/>
different things!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re big on thank you notes here. They are NOT mandatory! BUT since we <br/>
know how much *appreciated* they are, we write them to show gratitude. <br/>
The boys have seen me and Ben model this for years and years. Duncan, <br/>
at just 11, decided to write them for the birthday $$ he got from <br/>
grandparents this year. First time. He&#39;s ready.<br/>
<br/>
Cameron (19), on the other hand, has been writing them for years. NICE <br/>
ones, too! BECAUSE HE WANTS TO!!!! It&#39;s nice. It&#39;s appreciated. But <br/>
it&#39;s NOT mandatory. His are stunning beautiful AND heartfelt.<br/>
<br/>
You may think that MAKING someone write them may &quot;teach&quot; manners.<br/>
<br/>
But what the child learns is 1) &quot;I HATE flippin&#39; thank you notes,&quot; and <br/>
2) &quot;I wish she hadn&#39;t GIVEN me that stupid present.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
MODEL the act of writing them. Don&#39;t make them out to be a chore. Not: <br/>
&quot;I HAVE to write thank you notes today.&quot; Instead try: &quot;I&#39;m going to <br/>
write Aunt Jane a thank you for that lovely sweater. I&#39;ll use the same <br/>
color stationary as the yarn! And I&#39;ll enclose a photo of me wearing <br/>
the sweater.&quot; Keep plenty of beautiful papers, and design your own <br/>
cards and envelopes. Have a &quot;stationary station&quot;---just for notes and <br/>
letters.<br/>
<br/>
And the whole &quot;not finishing sometihng she starts&quot; crap---what may <br/>
happen is that she quits STARTING anything!<br/>
<br/>
Happens all the time. If you started knitting a sweater, but got <br/>
half-way through and quit, how would you feel if your husband MADE you <br/>
finish?<br/>
<br/>
INternal motivation!<br/>

But sometimes she wants help, too. Even doing things she&#39;s done a <br/>
hundred times - writing her name or I Love You. I see those moments as <br/>
really important. I want my kid to know that she *can* ask for help <br/>
whenever she feels like something is too much for her to handle, and I <br/>
want to support her in deciding how much is &quot;too much&quot;. Pushing or <br/>
coaxing her to do things that I know she can do doesn&#39;t support that. <br/>
It undermines her learning process by telling her that *I* know better <br/>
than she does when she&#39;s ready or capable. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sometimes it *is* okay, though. Pulling the car over when its <br/>
raining too hard to see is okay. Taking a break digging post-holes <br/>
on a hot day might be a good idea. Asking a friend with help on a <br/>
project that&#39;s difficult is often a really great thing to do. <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve never done it before, see if you can visit a professional <br/>
craftsperson&#39;s workshop - with spring coming, maybe you can find <br/>
an &quot;art crawl&quot; or something that lets you see artists and <br/>
craftspeople in their &quot;natural habitats&quot;. Maybe go to a quilt shop! <br/>
Ask them if they have any &quot;unfinished&quot; projects lying around <br/>
gathering dust. Watch for the sheepish grin! I have boxes and boxes <br/>
of experimental projects that never quite got off the ground. Every <br/>
now and then I find a use for one! Some days I go into my workshop <br/>
with the knowledge that I am starting a project that will most <br/>
likely end up in one of those boxes. Its part of my learning <br/>
process. Its part of a great many people&#39;s learning process. <br/>
<br/>
As long as you are making the decision as to which projects your dd <br/>
will finish, you are standing in the way of her discovering <br/>
something about herself. My house is full of partly finished kid-<br/>
projects, but its not uncommon for my 5yo to say to me &quot;Not now, <br/>
Mer, I want to finish.&quot; That&#39;s something I respect with every bit of <br/>
patience and creativity I have, even if what she&#39;s &quot;finishing&quot; looks <br/>
to me like squishing playdoh into the backs of legos - finish? By <br/>
all means! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1814906109">I had a conversation about mandatory &quot;thank you&quot;&#39;s yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
Two days ago Linnaea (6--7 next week!) got everything ready for bed for us. <br/>
She heated the hot rice bags in the microwave, she straightened the bedding, <br/>
she got water in the cup for her that I fill ever night, she found her <br/>
pajamas and brushed her teeth. I do that most nights, but I was levelling up <br/>
Simon&#39;s WoW character and was moving less actively toward bed. And as I <br/>
noticed everything she had done, of her own accord, generously, lovingly, I <br/>
realized two things. 1. If I required her to do these things, I would never <br/>
have known the love of her doing them for me. 2. She notices all of these <br/>
things that I do to make the bed we share more comfortable, easier to stay <br/>
in once we get into it. She showed me appreciation for what I do without <br/>
ever saying thank you and without having it be &quot;one of those things that <br/>
needs to be done in our household.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I may suggest that a thank you is a nice thing to do when we go to someone <br/>
else&#39;s house, but only so they understand the social norms. If they feel shy <br/>
or uncomfortable, I am more than loud and effusive enough for their not <br/>
saying thank you to be that much of an issue. No one in our family sends us <br/>
thank yous, so I&#39;m not actually all that concerned about sending ones out. <br/>
I&#39;ll call or e-mail our thanks, but by the time I&#39;ve gone and gotten cards <br/>
and actually sat down to write them I may have forgotten who gave what to <br/>
whom. Or it is a few months later and it really seems an exercise in <br/>
futility.<br/>
<br/>
Requiring a thank you from anyone really isn&#39;t evidence that they <br/>
appreciated or enjoyed the gift. It is more evidence that they can perform a <br/>
social nicety/trick.<br/>

recently that if I&#39;d never stopped anything that I was doing I&#39;d still be in <br/>
diapers, I&#39;d be a concert pianist, I&#39;d still be able to walk on the top of <br/>

Sometimes you are just done. Sometimes you want a break. Sometimes you don&#39;t <br/>
want to knit a sweater. And sometimes you come back to those things again <br/>
and again and again. Giving up when the going gets rough is okay. I give up <br/>
when the going gets rough all the time. But sometimes I keep trying until I <br/>
get too frustrated and then I yell and I freak out and I stomp and rage. I <br/>
try not to do that very often though. I don&#39;t like that feeling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

&gt; out.  For example, she needed to write a &quot;thank you&quot; note for birthday<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why did she need to write a &quot;thank you&quot; note? What was going to happen if <br/>
she didn&#39;t? If you did it instead? If you just sent the original you&#39;d <br/>
written instead of making your daughter feel all squitchy and angry and <br/>
powerless inside doing something with too many letters in it? What would <br/>
have happened? Maybe you and she could have done something fun? Maybe you <br/>
could have sent some sweet little thing to friends saying how great it was <br/>
to see them thereby cementing your friendships even further? Where was her <br/>
need to write those thank yous?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This is part of how we&#39;re learning to write.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Are you having trouble with your writing? It seems pretty good from my point <br/>
of view. Maybe when you say &quot;we&quot; you mean &quot;she&quot;? It makes a difference if <br/>
you think of her as an individual separate from you. It makes a difference <br/>
if you see that what she needs and wants isn&#39;t always what you need and <br/>
want. You and she are individuals with different goals and aspirations. <br/>
Maybe what she needs to figure out writing is different from what you need <br/>
to keep your writing skills honed. Simon, my 9 year old son, has never <br/>
written at my forcing. The other day he wrote something about what house he <br/>
was in at Hogwarts and what his pets were and what kind of wand he has and <br/>
his writing was so much clearer than it had been a year ago, 2 years ago. <br/>
The drawing and tracing and writing that he does, without my standing over <br/>
him and making him do school work, has made as much of a difference as <br/>
tracing letters or dotted line workbooks did for mine in school. And it did <br/>
so without him feeling miserable or like a failure or like he couldn&#39;t learn <br/>
without being put under some sort of duresse. As a side note Simon isn&#39;t <br/>
quite reading yet. The puzzle pieces are clearly lining up, but he isn&#39;t <br/>
quite ready to put it all together. So what he wrote was information he was <br/>
copying off of the internet or that I was helping him to spell. He wanted it <br/>

give report cards to infants:<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not unschooling if you believe you must make her do something in  <br/>
order to learn how or that she should do thank you notes, that she  <br/>
can&#39;t learn that by living life.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter (15) is way better at thank yous than I am. I&#39;ve never  <br/>
made her write thank yous, though, of course, she has learned about  <br/>
them by living life. She writes thank yous because she *wants* to,  <br/>
because she knows how good it feels when someone thanks her (and  <br/>
we&#39;ve remarked how thoughtful it is that someone has put in the  <br/>
effort to make that gesture of thanks), and because she wants to put  <br/>
the effort into thanking someone<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  This is part of how we�re learning to write.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschoolers learn to write by needing to write for personally  <br/>
meaningful reasons. They *choose* to write -- IMs, emails, posts on  <br/>
message boards are the most common, but also poetry and stories for  <br/>
their own personal satisfaction -- because they want to communicate  <br/>
with someone. And they get better at it as a side effect because they  <br/>
have an internal drive to communicate their thoughts better and  <br/>
naturally pick up better ways to get their points across.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She copies what I�ve written (a sentence) and will sometimes get<br/>
&gt; frustrated at the number of letters in the sentence.  So, she can  <br/>
&gt; finish<br/>
&gt; part of the letter and start afresh the next day.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>While she&#39;s going to absorb some of the language of thanks you notes  <br/>
that way, she can do the same by being with someone else writing a  <br/>
thank you, or if you write it for her and ask for her input, and by  <br/>
receiving thank yous.<br/>
<br/>
By being made to do them, what she&#39;s learning also (besides wording)  <br/>
is to associate an unpleasant feeling with thank yous (frustration,  <br/>
irritation, pressure), and that when two people don&#39;t agree about  <br/>
something that if you&#39;re bigger you can make the other person do what  <br/>
you want.<br/>

important it is by doing it yourself rather than making someone else  <br/>
conform to your values.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s bound to have more pleasant associations with thank yous if you  <br/>
write it and ask if she&#39;d like to give some input: how she felt about  <br/>
the present, what she did with it, etc.<br/>

What would you rather receive: a thank you coerced out of someone who  <br/>
can&#39;t wait until they can get away from writing it and for whom some  <br/>
of the bad thoughts of being made to write are transferring to the  <br/>
present and the giver, or someone who was eager to share a few words  <br/>
as mom wrote, or actually sat down and wrote a note all on her own?<br/>
<br/>
We can make kids go through the motions of politeness but what does  <br/>
that mean? Isn&#39;t the real goal sincere feelings and a desire to  <br/>
express them?<br/>
<br/>
We need to trust that our kids will have feelings of thankfulness  <br/>
they want to express when they&#39;re old enough to do so. In the  <br/>
meantime we can model being polite for them and talk about how good  <br/>
it feels when someone has gone out of their way to do something nice  <br/>
for us.<br/>

If someone has learned what they wanted to learn from getting part  <br/>

thank you note.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t do it with the goal of getting her to write thank you notes.<br/>
<br/>
Do it because you think it&#39;s important. Do it because you sincerely  <br/>
want to thank her. As a side effect she&#39;ll experience how good it  <br/>
feels to have someone acknowledge something they&#39;ve done and she&#39;ll  <br/>
be exposed to the language of thank you notes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1883681883">I second Joyce&#39;s response.<br/>
   <br/>
  Before I came across unschooling, I had searched the gifted groups <br/>
  for advice.  I had asked a similiar question.<br/>
   <br/>
  They very quickly said almost verbatim what Joyce said.  <br/>
  (Humm differant concepts on education styles, but same<br/>
  thoughts on how kids learn, interesting.)<br/>
<br/>
  They all told me that thier kids started many differant projects<br/>
  some they finish, most they don&#39;t.  They explore it as long as <br/>
  it holds their thoughts then they move on.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Gee, they even pointed out that this is how most things are learned <br/>
  in the grown up world.  A new idea is thought of.  Sometimes it works.<br/>
  Sometimes you start over again.  Sometimes it&#39;s dropped as it wasn&#39;t<br/>
  a good idea.  Sometimes, someone else picks up your idea, change<br/>
  it a bit, and they make it work.<br/>
   <br/>
  Interesting...<br/>
