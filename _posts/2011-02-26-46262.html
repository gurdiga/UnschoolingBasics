<div id="ygrps-yiv-1255491615">Hello all.<br/>
<br/>
Over the past five years of following my heart and intuition here on  <br/>
Vancouver island to Unschool my children on every level, this is what  <br/>
i have discovered. This has been a journey deep into self and looking  <br/>
at all the beliefs i personally have. Children are naturals at this,  <br/>
this is there innate state. There is nothing to defend against there  <br/>
is nothing to make special about it, or to make any other belief  <br/>
system right or wrong. It really is a journey of trust. I have come to  <br/>
know this has been part of my spiritual path. I think the most  <br/>
important thing, is whether a child is in school, or if they are  <br/>
not...its about all of us following our hearts and our inner guidance  <br/>
in whatever form that make take.<br/>
<br/>
I personally feel that unschooling is more than unschooling.As my  <br/>
children lead the way as what is natural to them, i can trust and look  <br/>
at any all fears that arise in myself or others around me, knowing its  <br/>
an opportunity just to look into my own mind to see what my beliefs  <br/>
are..<br/>
<br/>
Just felt to share...Sandy</div>
