<div id="ygrps-yiv-656294298">The cool things about Jared, who learned to read at 12:<br/>
<br/>
~when we were driving around town, he didn&#39;t read the signs, he saw<br/>
interesting patterns, or clouds, or colors...saw the world totally<br/>
different than a reader (once you can read, you can&#39;t NOT read...try<br/>
looking at a sign and not reading it!)<br/>
<br/>
~he saw symbols and patterns everywhere...he could memorize literally<br/>
hundreds of symbols from games.<br/>
<br/>
~his memorization skills were amazing, he knew every single Yu-gi-oh<br/>
card in his deck based on the picture. After we read it a few times,<br/>
he&#39;d KNOW it....defense, attack etc... all from memory.<br/>
<br/>
~he loves to draw. Because he wasn&#39;t concerned about letters or<br/>
reading, I think that was how he wanted to express himself. He has<br/>
spent many, many hours drawing since he was four years old and is<br/>
quite talented.<br/>
<br/>
~you could probably say this about a lot of people, but I often wonder<br/>
if it has anything to do with late reading....he loves to sit and<br/>
ponder/daydream. I often wonder if pushing reading on any level would<br/>
have interfered with that thought process. He asks some very deep<br/>
questions and has a fantastic imagination. I know that most<br/>
unschoolers  have these qualities too...so it has less to do with WHEN<br/>
a person reads, and more to do with not interfering with their own<br/>
internal guidance systems.:)<br/>
<br/>
Can you even imagine seeing the world without words?? How COOL! To be<br/>
able to just see what is there, without reading the signs and messages<br/>
everywhere, what a gift.<br/>

***************<br/>
<br/>
To expand on that, they can&#39;t read the annoying signs in front of the  <br/>
schools that push reading.  A recent one in my neighborhood; &quot;READ, READ,  READ!!!!&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
I didn&#39;t want to read after I saw that.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1464442441">I noticed the same thing about Karl but never really associated it with not<br/>
reading at an early age. Karl didn&#39;t read anything until about 10, then he<br/>
read game manuals, game text and such as needed and now at 14 he just<br/>
started reading books.  He was not remotely interested in reading untill he<br/>
discovered Pokemon and the many guide books.  But his memorization skills<br/>
were and are astounding. He has had big parts in plays before he coule read,<br/>
he knew the stats of each and every pokemon he owned and what they could<br/>
become and why, their strengths and weaknesses and how they intereacted with<br/>
each other. Something interesting we discovered a few years ago. I think<br/>
Karl was 10 or 11. Not reading much yet. I came to unschooling rather slowly<br/>
and was hesitant about all the time he spent with Pokeomon. A good friend<br/>
who has his Phd in reading assessment or some such thing (and oddly enough,<br/>
has always been very supportive of homeschooling and unschooling).  Anywya,<br/>
he took a job where he needed to give all these assessment tests. Many for<br/>
&#39;learning disabilities&#39; and closed head injuries. He wanted to practice his<br/>
test-giving skills and asked if Karl was willing to be a guinea pig. Karl<br/>
has a good relationship with this guy, the tests are like games and he<br/>
always fed him wll so Karl was more than willing. I agreed as long as my<br/>
friend understood that the results meant nothing to me and we would stop any<br/>
time Karl wanted to. And Karl would probably skew any stats. Anyway, he went<br/>
through the whole battery of tests. He actually took more than any one<br/>
&#39;patient&#39; would normally take, but they were having fun my friend gave as<br/>
many as Karl was willing to take.  As I expected, he was above &#39;grade level&#39;<br/>
in some areas, below in others....but what was astounding to my friend were<br/>
two results. Karl, a non-reader, had a vocabulary score that was off the<br/>
chart for college level. No big surprise to me, I knew he has been exposed<br/>
to lots of good information all his life, reading does not guarentee a good<br/>
vocabulary.   And another test that measured memory skills, both short term<br/>
and long term. He again scored off the chart. When he described the test to<br/>
me I laughed. I told him that compared to what Karl needed to know for<br/>
Pokemon, the test was a peice of cake!!  Mind you, I would have done poorly,<br/>
I never was good at memory stuff, but for Karl, it was a breeze. Another<br/>
test he did well on was some kind of congnitive reasoning test. He could<br/>
figure things out well.  The tests that measured &quot;knowledge&quot; for his age he<br/>
was all over the spectrum.  Really low to a bit above average.  My friends<br/>
final comment was, he might not know what society says he&#39;s &quot;supposed&quot; to<br/>
know, but it won&#39;t matter, when he needs to know something, he has the tools<br/>
he needs.  He still talks about the memory tests results.  Though it wasn&#39;t<br/>
my goal when I agreed to the testing, it sure helped ease some of my<br/>
fears. I&#39;m not advocating testing either, for the most part, I think a lots<br/>
of tests are flawed, admininstered incorrectly or used incorrectly.  But<br/>
Karl had a lot of fun and it was interesting to see.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1600110958">Extrodinary Communication skills.  Over the years, when dd chooses to do a presentation of sorts to a group of people, she doesn&#39;t rely on reading prepared written text.  She really knows the material, makes eye contact with her audience and can explain the subject matter well and feild questions. <br/>
<br/>
Extreme Resourcefullness.  DD has taught art/craft classes, created camps and generates income.  All this requires marketing, sales, communication and people skills, budgeting and planning, money handling etc.  Not reading has never stopped her.  She finds assistants to accomplish the tasks for which she is less skilled.<br/>
