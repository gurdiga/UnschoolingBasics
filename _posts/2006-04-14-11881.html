<div id="ygrps-yiv-270460295">So we were just visiting Buffalo, NY and my cousin and I took our children  <br/>
to the zoo.  It was a beautiful spring day (doesn&#39;t usually hit 70 in April  in <br/>
Buffalo).  We had planned on going to the museum, but then it was too  nice <br/>
to be inside.  The kids had a great time, I got sunburned (been a long  time <br/>
here since my skin we saw so much sun), and my kids got to do the zoo thing  <br/>
which is a treat because living in the country, we have no zoos, museus, etc.  <br/>
(but of course, we have our own nature and animals at our house- chckens, dogs,  <br/>
etc).<br/>
 <br/>
But while we were there, the kids were looking at these neat pull up wooden  <br/>
flaps with info under them about different animals- in front of the lemur  <br/>
exhibit.  and a mom says to her so who is having a great time loking under  all <br/>
of them and trying to read all the info on his own  &quot;well, do you just  want to <br/>
read all that, or can we cut that out and go look at the animals!&quot;, she  was <br/>
pretty upset that he was wasting her time by wanting to READ about the  animal <br/>
habitat, rather than just run around and look at the animals  quickly.  Sos <br/>
they moved on and my son got to look at the flaps where the  other kid had been <br/>
looking.<br/>
 <br/>
But WE had a very nice time!<br/>

It is amazing to me that a mother would not let her child read, but  you see <br/>
it everyday almost.  In all instances.  Parents just not  realizing how their <br/>
detachment from their children&#39;s needs cause them to do  things that are very <br/>
detrimental to their children. Its just sad.<br/>

<br/>
Once while at the zoo in Gulf Breeze there were two neatly dressed<br/>
parents with a 3 year old dressed in nice plaid shorts, white shirt,<br/>
white socks and little black shiny shoes...The were stopped near a<br/>
little pile of sand and the child bent over to play with it in his<br/>
hands and his mother freaked out, said his name and with a disgusted<br/>
voice says, &quot;Uh!  Young man, we do not play in the dirt!  We came to<br/>
see the animals.&quot;  The whole time I&#39;m thinking, &quot;Well, the zoo is not<br/>
the cleanest place to wear your family picture clothes to in the first<br/>
place.  And, dang, whats wrong with a child wanting to play in the dirt?&quot;<br/>

I still think it is just sad, and parents are left asking, why isn&#39;t  my kids <br/>
happy?<br/>

<br/>
What&#39;s wrong with a grown up playing in the dirt?  LOL  I  still do it, its <br/>
one of my favorite past times, and it drives my MIL  crazy.  She would have <br/>
been the woman yelling.  One time my son *gasp*  had the audacity to pee on a <br/>
tree outside.  We live in the middle of  nowhere and I don&#39;t see the need to come <br/>
inside just to go to the  bathroom.  Anyway, we were at my MIL&#39;s house.  And <br/>
Jared just walked  up to the tree and pee&#39;d.  I laughed, but she threw a FIT.  <br/>
She yelled  and screamed at Jared, then I yelled at her LOL because she had <br/>
no right to yell  at him for something I saw nothing wrong with.  Granted when <br/>
we got home I  did explain to him that that was inappropriate and you don&#39;t <br/>
pee in the middle  for your grandma&#39;s front yard.  But she wayyyyyyyy <br/>
over-reacted.  It  still tickles my funny bone to this day.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-383893456">Hopefully nothing, because that&#39;s what we have in our backyard, grass  <br/>
doesn&#39;t survive the Gray family!<br/>
<br/>
When the kids *were* in school, Breanna&#39;s special ed class did a lot  <br/>
of painting and messy crafts. The assistants would be so apologetic  <br/>
every time the clothes got dirty, and be so relieved when I would say  <br/>
no big deal. Every other parent in the class would get furious. Um,  <br/>
Hello, clothes are for wearing. Kids are for playing. Somewhere they  <br/>
have to meet! ;-)<br/>
