<div id="ygrps-yiv-181235645">I got this question by email and thought I&#39;d share it:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; In the &quot;If-then&quot; section you were talking about just that -- &quot;If- <br/>
&gt; Then&quot; situations, and that made perfect sense to me.  But then in a  <br/>
&gt; later section (parenting or chores, maybe?)  You mention Cake  <br/>
&gt; Baking - and how they should be able to bake/make messes/etc if  <br/>
&gt; they want, but it would be the Mom&#39;s responsibilty to clean it.   <br/>
&gt; Why wouldn&#39;t that just be part of an &quot;If - then&quot; situation?  &quot;If  <br/>
&gt; they want to bake a cake, then they would have to do the whole  <br/>
&gt; process of cake baking&quot;?  My daughter loves to play around in the  <br/>
&gt; kitchen, and I always thought of the &quot;clean up&quot; as part of the  <br/>
&gt; whole &quot;process of baking&quot;, or what-have-you.  The cleaning up of  <br/>
&gt; making a cake is just part of the whole process of cake making -  <br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t it?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Am I making any sense?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, your question makes perfect sense.<br/>
<br/>
It might help you see it more clearly if you ask yourself what your  <br/>
goal is. Is the goal to have a clean kitchen or the experience of  <br/>
making a cake? If the goal is a clean kitchen, then it&#39;s better not  <br/>
to have children! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Ah, but why can&#39;t the goal be both a clean kitchen and a cake?<br/>
<br/>
It can be. But ...<br/>
<br/>
When we have two goals there often comes a time when the two goals  <br/>
conflict: to meet one you need to give up the other. What if your  <br/>
daughter responded to your contract with, &quot;Okay, then I don&#39;t feel  <br/>
like making a cake.&quot; What will you have gained and what will you have  <br/>
lost? Would you rather when she grew up she had memories of a clean  <br/>
kitchen or a particularly yummy creation?<br/>
<br/>
When I did crafts with my daughter it did always seem as though there  <br/>
was more setting up and cleaning up than crafting :-/ but I realized  <br/>
that if my daughter associated a tedious clean up as a necessary part  <br/>
of crafts, then she&#39;d choose crafts a lot less. And what would I have  <br/>
gained? A neat craft cabinet? What&#39;s the point of that!?<br/>
<br/>
That said, clean up can be an organic part of creating. You can say  <br/>
&quot;Could you put the milk back in the refrigerator for me?&quot; and &quot;This  <br/>
goes on the second shelf of the cabinet.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But *accept* that the clean up is your contribution to helping your  <br/>
daughter explore. It&#39;s like the $30 you spend to get into the science  <br/>
center. Would you ask her to pay her part of the admission price? And  <br/>
if she chose not to, what would you have gained?<br/>
<br/>
So rather than thinking about how you can make her clean up, rethink  <br/>
the process of cake baking. What I do is set all the ingredients out  <br/>
in the order the recipe calls for them. I read off the directions a  <br/>
step at a time. When she&#39;s done with an ingredient, I put it away.  <br/>
When she&#39;s done with a bowl or cup, I put it in the dishwasher.  <br/>
There&#39;s still some clean up at the end, but it&#39;s a lot less. And  <br/>
since I&#39;ve focused on trying not to associate helping me with  <br/>
unpleasantness, she is very willing to help me out. (I have certainly  <br/>
not been perfect in not getting upset about clean up! But, though  <br/>
pressuring to clean up lets off steam, I can clearly see it has the  <br/>
opposite effect on my daughter than I want.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>THIS is the stuff I love - take a common situation and find a<br/>
different, JOYFUL way of looking at it - and in turn change the<br/>
*feeling* you hold in body about it. One way feels grumbley,<br/>
resentful, and coercive (not great energy to carry around or approach<br/>
relationships with). The other way feels good - it&#39;s loving,<br/>
supportive, and allows a little more joy into your life.<br/>
<br/>
All it takes is a shift in perspective! Charles Swindell said, &quot;I am<br/>
convinced that life is 10 percent what happens to me and 90 percent<br/>
how I react to it.&quot; Another way of saying it is, &quot;Life is ten percent<br/>
situation, 90% attitude - how we *choose* approach it.&quot; Attitude is<br/>
*big*.<br/>
<br/>
DH and I were talking about this. If I complain about my daughter<br/>
leaving her dishes on the coffee table, if I make a point of telling<br/>
her that *I* had to pick them up and walk all the way over to the sink<br/>
and clean them up, etc, then I make it that much *less* appealing for<br/>
her to do it herself because I&#39;ve made such a big deal of how<br/>
unpleasant it was for me to do it, and my resentment is clearly<br/>
showing her that it&#39;s a joyless chore that I prefer to avoid. So even<br/>
if she does it next time, will she be doing it with a light heart or<br/>
will she be thinking about what a PITA it is to have to clean up? Plus<br/>
there was the time and energy I expended to fuss at her, and the<br/>
critical, conditional messages she heard in my complaining.<br/>
<br/>
If, instead, I think of how picking up her dishes is a small way of<br/>
helping to care for her, and it leaves her with more uninterrupted<br/>
time to play the game she enjoys so much, and how it&#39;s not difficult<br/>
at all because I&#39;m walking right past them on my way into the kitchen<br/>
anyways, and I just joyfully pick them up without saying anything,<br/>
then not only have I saved myself from harboring all those negative<br/>
feelings, I&#39;ve spared her from them, too, and found joy in my heart by<br/>
doing something small and simple for someone I love, but I&#39;ve also<br/>
modeled that picking up our messes can be just a routine,<br/>
uncomplicated part of living together.<br/>
<br/>
And, lo and behold, she takes the dishes to the sink much, much more<br/>
than she ever did when I spent time fussing at her about it. My goal<br/>
is not to raise a daughter that always takes her dishes to the sink<br/>
but to raise a child who feels loved, within family that lives<br/>
joyfully. And that starts with my *attitude* when I interact her, the<br/>
way I think about things and the corresponding feelings I bring into<br/>
our relationship. Sometimes the dishes are a side effect of that.  :)<br/>
