I don&#39;t post very often but we are having a really hard time with this one also.  Ren, or anyone, my ds(10)is bipolar and explodes when I or anyone tells him no or to stop.And if he doesn&#39;t explode he will just ignore.If we try to physically try to remove him from hurting his brother(5)(he doesn&#39;t usually hurt him,more like  alienate him and tease him.really makes him squeal.) he will fight us and he is 5&#39;3 and 135 lb and strong beyond belief <br/>

I also have a son who is very explosive.  He is not diagnosed bi-polar, but I am familiar with the rages you are talking about.  I am in the middle of reading a book called &quot;The Explosive Child&quot; by Ross W. Greene, Ph.D. and so far have found it to be a fascinating read.  I started to read it because of my son, and continue to read it also because I recognize so much of myself in this book.  The main point of the book (my opinion) is that because of various sensory processing disorders (sight, sound, taste, touch, reading, smell, and/or communicating) the child is already at almost max frustration at all times, so when something.......anything goes wrong they overload and explode.  I&#39;m still reading, so I&#39;m not sure how much help his ideas will be, but I have high hopes because he has nailed our problems...it&#39;s like he was living in our house or in my childhood when he wrote this book.   I hope this helps<br/>

I haven&#39;t been on much lately (for many reasons which I won&#39;t go <br/>
into right now).   You both might want to also check out another <br/>
yahoo group &quot;shinewithunschooling&quot; for a different perspective, <br/>

Patricia already tried, they refused her membership. Heidi is a member <br/>
there already.<br/>
<br/>
I do think it&#39;s a great list for children with special challenges <br/>
though. I believe we have it listed under &quot;links&quot;, I&#39;ll double check.<br/>

  I just got this book for myself as a Christmas present&lt;G&gt; but haven&#39;t <br/>
  had the chance to start it.Maybe today.<br/>
  How old is your son?<br/>

I think that group is geared more for very sensitive kids (mine is also vey sensitive,but can become explosive)<br/>
  Thanks Jann,<br/>

Hi Tricia!<br/>
You posted with a combo of many other posts.   The one above is from <br/>
someone else!  My dd is 13 and highly sensitive, but not <br/>
explosive.   This was my answer:<br/>
&quot;You both might want to also check out another yahoo <br/>
group &quot;shinewithunschooling&quot; for a different perspective, especially <br/>

<br/>
The book that has helped us a lot is &quot;The Highly Sensitive Person&quot; <br/>
(she also wrote the Highly Sensitive Child, but I got the other as <br/>
my dh, I now realize, is ALSO highly sensitive (HS)), plus they&#39;re <br/>
both anxious.   I&#39;m still reading it.<br/>
