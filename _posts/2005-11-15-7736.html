<div id="ygrps-yiv-1100712836">My son Echo is almost 5 yo.  We came to unschooling about a yr and a half<br/>
ago and that has led us closer to TCS and radical unschooling.  I recognize<br/>
that it is a journey and dh and I have lots to learn but more than anything<br/>
I want/try to be respectful, patient and understanding.  Now for my dilemma<br/>
- Echo has a friend Aanaleese, she is 5.5 and homeschooled in a very relaxed<br/>
way, her mom and I have been friends for about a year and I consider her<br/>
very dear and I see our friendship as a very important one that I want to<br/>
nurture and grow old with - I hope that makes sense.  I have lots of<br/>
girlfriends but I see her and her family as special.<br/>
<br/>
Aanaleese and Echo play together about once per week, sometimes more.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
In the past couple of mos, when she visits they play &quot;family&quot;, where Echo is<br/>
the dad, Aanaleese is the mom and my 2 yo daughter is either the gma or more<br/>
recently the daughter.  Echo and Aanaleese are very loving and nurturing to<br/>
their &quot;daughter&quot; and honestly I have teared up over some of the sweet<br/>
situations that have come up in their &quot;parenting&quot; of their &quot;daughter&quot;.  I<br/>
can go into more detail as needed.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My question is this.Echo has never expressed any type of romantic feelings<br/>
or play with any other kids so this is all very new for me.  I have noticed<br/>
lately that lately when they play &quot;family&quot; Aanaleese always likes to bring<br/>
the role playing into bedtime.where the mom and dad are going to bed.  So<br/>
this basically means 2 5 yo  going to bed in the middle of the day.  What do<br/>
they do - they lie in bed.  There has been talk of &quot;would you like to take<br/>
your wedding ring off and put it on the table with mine&quot; etc.  It&#39;s all very<br/>
innocent and sweet and I feel proud that they both have loving relationships<br/>
to model.  Dh and I are very affectionate and always have been without<br/>
feeling shameful or as if we should not kiss/hug in front of the kids.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Again, I am happy to divuldge any info to help you understand the goings on<br/>
without typing it all out now.  I&#39;m just wondering in a nut shell if this<br/>
all sounds okay and if you would be comfortable with all of this.  In my<br/>
heart I am okay with it but not sure &quot;how&quot; to handle it or if I should<br/>
&quot;handle&quot; anything in th e first place.  We have a 2 story house where the<br/>
kids have 2 bedrooms and a bath upstairs.  When my kids are home without<br/>
friends over, they choose to be downstairs with me ut when they have<br/>
Aanaleese over, they choose to be upstairs.I do pop in and visit with them,<br/>
I also invite them down to do other things with me but when Aanaleese is<br/>
over they are almost always in character it seems.  There are 3 beds<br/>
upstairs as well as a pretend kitchen, living area, dinette, dress up box<br/>
etc.so that is the &#39;family&#39;s&quot; homestead and when I try to involve myself<br/>
they obviously do not want/need me there.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
On Friday.the kids came down for a snack and while I was preparing it, I<br/>
peeked into the living room to see Echo and Aanaleese in eachother&#39;s arms.<br/>
Well ithought it was very sweet but at the same time (was it MY upbringing<br/>
that triggered these feelings?) it did make me a tad uncomfortable.  Again,<br/>
it was very innocent and loving looking.Echo says she is his best friend<br/>
ever and he loves her very much OR do I need to have a talk with my son.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I guess I am just a bit confused.are they too young?  My parents shamed me<br/>
for this sort of thing and I don&#39;t want to make them feel shameful - they<br/>
really do love eachother, but they are 5!!!!  Gotta go now but I look<br/>
forward to some feed back and hearing what you all would do/ have done in<br/>
this situation.<br/>

This all sounds sweet and innocent to me.  As long as you can talk freely with Echo and check in periodically to make sure both kids are comfortable with the game, I wouldn&#39;t worry.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-905328134">MaRY - THANKS for your reply and for sharing your wisdom!  I really<br/>
appreciate it.  I have a feeling you are correct, it&#39;s the not worrying part<br/>
that is a challenge!<br/>
Again thank you. <br/>
