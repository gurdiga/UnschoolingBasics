<div id="ygrps-yiv-308319910">We are having a little bit of conflict in relation to my 14 yr old son&#39;s <br/>
busy schedule.<br/>
<br/>
The first thing is: He wants to be up during the day to do things that <br/>
he has planned-  and also have time to do things that aren&#39;t quiet in <br/>
the house before we all go to sleep- early, my husband is a carpenter <br/>
and gets out by 7:30, and I like to get up early too, to work (I work at <br/>
home part time) before the kids are up and we get out of the house. <br/>
Anyway, he agrees that playing his bass and stacking firewood (outside <br/>
our bedroom, near the back door where the stove is) are best done before <br/>
9-10 pm, and is very respectful of our needing sleep. The issue is that <br/>
he has difficulty getting to sleep early enough so that he can get up to <br/>
do all the things he wants to do during the day and feel well rested. In <br/>
addition he really seems to need a lot of sleep.<br/>
<br/>
Our house is pretty small- I thought that he could play bass in the <br/>
garage- he didn&#39;t really like that idea. I would love for him to have <br/>
his own little house next to ours he could have more freedom- but that <br/>
would be a longer term solution, due to finances and time constraints.<br/>
Anyone have anything to suggest that they have done to help a night owl <br/>
at least somewhat adjust to a little bit of a daytime schedule, or to <br/>
accommodate different sleeping schedules in a small house? <br/>
<br/>
In general also he really takes on a lot and has a bit of a time crunch <br/>
with preparing for lessons and performances, working for money, soccer, <br/>
and all the other things he really wants to do. I talk about the <br/>
possibility of cutting back on some things as it is a bit much for me <br/>
and his sister to drive him to as well as a lot for him to handle, but <br/>
he usually doesn&#39;t want to cut back, or not really enough to make a <br/>
difference. I have asked him what I can do to help him, the last two <br/>
days we have together made up a schedule so that he can fit everything <br/>
in and not get to the end of the day and feel like he has not <br/>
accomplished what he set up to accomplish. He is like me, pretty goal <br/>
oriented. I am totally okay with him not getting these things &quot;done&quot; by <br/>
the way, but he has commitments, especially with music, to groups and to <br/>
himself, which he takes pretty seriously and feels very frustrated when <br/>
he doesn&#39;t feel prepared. He does go through periods where he will do <br/>
much less. Part of this is that many things are on a school like <br/>
schedule so they are all clustered together for a few months and then <br/>
are over. He does somethings at the high school and at the college, or <br/>
with people who are on those schedules. I know many families make rules <br/>
about how many activities each child can sign up for, but I am not <br/>
thinking this will work- the kids needs are so different in this respect.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is much less interested in doing things out of the home, and <br/>
feels very angry sometimes that she is asked to come along when all the <br/>
stops are about her brother. We usually stop for extra treats or to pick <br/>
up some new beads so that my daughter has something to look forward to <br/>
on our trips out. I have started to leave her home for a little while <br/>
though she is only 10 and I am not super comfortable with this- I think <br/>
she would be fine in most all situations- she feels comfortable- but I <br/>
worry about the extreme situation and legal implications. The way the <br/>
law works here, as I understand it from discussions from friends in <br/>
social services, is that there is no absolute age where a child can be <br/>
left alone, and that determinations of parental wrong doing are <br/>
determined after the fact by the case workers and courts if a situation <br/>
arises. When I am faced at one moment with one child who wants a ride <br/>
somewhere they really really want to go, and one who really really <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to leave the house, I will leave her home. Mostly I will be <br/>
able to work out another stop for her, but this doesn&#39;t work every <br/>
single time.<br/>
<br/>
I realize that solutions will arise from discussions with my family, but <br/>
thought it would be interesting to see what other people do. We do <br/>
arrange rides with other families, have looked into the bus (not many <br/>
running at the right times of day, usually, though I keep checking in <br/>
each new situation.)<br/>
<br/>
thanks-<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1156282286">Find ways to enjoy the car time! There is no magic solution, this is  <br/>
the way your kids are and, with one kid who wants to be on the go and  <br/>
the other who doesn&#39;t, you have to do what you are doing - find a  <br/>
balance and adjust it constantly. But, really, I had this for years -  <br/>
and now my youngest is 16 and of course no longer needs to come  <br/>
along, but very very often chooses just to ride along. I guess that  <br/>
means I did a good job of making the car time pretty fun! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are two challenges - maybe thinking of them separately will help:<br/>
<br/>
1. interrupting your daughter to go take your son somewhere. You know  <br/>
how to handle this - plenty of warning, reminders, and promise of  <br/>
protected uninterrupted time later.<br/>
<br/>
2. the actual boredom of car time (or waiting time while your son is  <br/>
at his activity). THIS is much easier - you can listen to Boomerang!  <br/>
or Jim Weiss cd&#39;s in the car - or other really special wonderful  <br/>
books. Harry Potter, maybe? Make an investment in some really super  <br/>
enticing books on cd and then only listen in the car. Have a box of  <br/>
car stuff for her to play with - special cool stuff.<br/>
<br/>
(By the way, if you&#39;re listening to books on cd, it can be annoying  <br/>
to try to keep finding your place - you lose it if someone takes the  <br/>
cd out of the cd player. But if you put the book on an mp3 player,  <br/>
those will usually keep your place in a book even if you listen to  <br/>
music in between. There are some mp3 players - my motorola is one -  <br/>
that keeps a lot of bookmarks, so you can have different places  <br/>
marked for different people or for different books. You don&#39;t need an  <br/>
expensive mp3 player for this.)<br/>
<br/>
So - you do your best to find a way to satisfy them both (don&#39;t  <br/>
forget to ask them to come up with their own ideas), and the reality  <br/>
is that there will be times when your daughter begrudges the need to  <br/>
go and times when your son won&#39;t get to go. As they watch and help  <br/>
you try to work it all out, they&#39;ll be learning how to find mutually  <br/>
agreeable solutions and learning to cope when the people around them  <br/>
aren&#39;t able to do so. Both are very important things to learn!<br/>
<br/>
Also, in these days of cell phones, leaving kids alone for a short  <br/>
time isn&#39;t as risky as it once was. Just make sure you have your  <br/>
phone on, the ringer on, the phone isn&#39;t buried in your purse or left  <br/>
in the car for a few minutes, etc. It can be scary for a kid to  <br/>
decide to call and not get an answer.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1459079526">Thanks, Pamela-<br/>
<br/>
We have done these things in the past, and now even have a small <br/>
portable DVD player which has been great for car rides and helping <br/>
making places the kids don&#39;t prefer to be more interesting. Also super <br/>
for snuggling in bed and watching a movie. My daughter uses this for <br/>
private DVD viewing in her own room as well- less expensive and more <br/>
versatile than a whole separate TV and DVD player.<br/>
<br/>
I think that this is a new phase of especially not wanting to <br/>
accommodate her brother - feeling a lack in her own life of fun options <br/>
- and goes beyond being bored in the car (the car rides are usually <br/>
short). She is going through a lack of playmates- one fun friend has <br/>
been away most of the summer and is now is in school- Her <br/>
cousins(absolute first choice always of playmates) are now busier as the <br/>
are going back to school and go in and out of being not so kind to her. <br/>
We do make a lot of offers for her to try things to meet people- <br/>
homeschooled and schooled. Her interests are very specific and she is <br/>
starting to be choosier about who she spends time with- so out of kids <br/>
who are available she only feels comfortable with a few, and then those <br/>
few aren&#39;t always available when she would  like them to be. The school <br/>
at home families put much less of a priority on play time. This was an <br/>
ongoing thing for my son in the past but now he seems to have formed <br/>
enough relationships that he has enough fun things to do- the teenagers <br/>
have also become more independent of their parents in making plans, <br/>
which works out better. I have been very frustrated in the past in <br/>
communicating with other parents- as their goals are very different than <br/>
mine. (mine being to facilitate what my kids want to do- their&#39;s being <br/>
to prevent their kids from doing what they see as a waste of time.)  He <br/>
is much more likely to find things in common with other kids his age. <br/>
Anyway- she feels very jealous of his busy social life. She is such a <br/>
different person and going through a transition. She seems to keep a <br/>
tally in her mind of who is &quot;getting&quot; more and often the situation seems <br/>
unfair to her and she feels very angry about it. I do try to make sure <br/>
she gets to do what she does want to do as much as possible, but it <br/>
seems deeper than that and that the actual things don&#39;t really make the <br/>
feelings go away. I am finding a balance between providing what things <br/>
and experiences are needed and allowing her feelings to emerge and be <br/>
validated. It is tricky. Often the anger is directed at me for not doing <br/>
enough, and doesn&#39;t always seem to be related to how much attention I <br/>
have been able to give her. I work at home and she most often prefers to <br/>
be doing things on her own but I need to be sensitive to the times when <br/>
she does need more of my attention and ideas. Other times offering ideas <br/>
and wanting to be with her is absolutely not wanted. Finding ways to <br/>
connect when she is upset is important- as she usually is angry doesn&#39;t <br/>
want comfort initially.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1919253334">One little tidbit of advice I can give you is to separate the  <br/>
different issues in your own mind - that way you can focus in on  <br/>
solutions much more easily. You&#39;re kind of smushing a bunch of things  <br/>
together. I focused on the car ride part just because I had some very  <br/>
simple and concrete suggestions for that, but it sounds like now  <br/>
you&#39;re saying that the car ride isn&#39;t an issue for her. If it is a  <br/>
little bit of an issue, now you have some more ideas, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Another little issue might be resentment that she&#39;s being  <br/>
interrupted. So - just saying - worth considering how to interrupt  <br/>
her in what she is doing, to take her sibling to his stuff, as little  <br/>
as possible.<br/>
<br/>
And, in your last email you really listed a number of other issues -  <br/>
I&#39;m suggesting separating them, in your own mind, and coming up with  <br/>
specific solutions to each. It is much harder to see a solution when  <br/>
you&#39;re looking at an array of different concerns, all at once.<br/>
<br/>
So - just to show you what I mean, I&#39;ll list the issues/concerns/ <br/>
problems that I get out of what you wrote (don&#39;t feel bad, it isn&#39;t  <br/>
that I&#39;m trying to beat you over the head with showing you how many  <br/>
problems you have &lt;G&gt;, but just saying that it is my experience that  <br/>
we can&#39;t find good solutions when we&#39;ve mushed this much stuff all  <br/>
together in our heads. It REALLY helps to just pick out a few of  <br/>
these - choose something you can do something about. Otherwise, every  <br/>
offered idea will be met (even just inside your own head) with a  <br/>
&quot;Yeah, but that doesn&#39;t solve the problem because it isn&#39;t just that,  <br/>
it is also .....&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Your daughter sounds a bit like my middle daughter (now 20) -  <br/>
especially that very strong sense of fairness.<br/>
<br/>
So - here is the list:<br/>
<br/>
Not wanting to accommodate her brother. (You wish she&#39;d care enough  <br/>
about her brother to WANT him to be happy, get what he wants, right?)<br/>
<br/>
Lack of fun options for activities in her own life.<br/>
<br/>
Lack of playmates because they are busy with school.<br/>
<br/>
Her cousins, whom she likes to play with, going through phases of not  <br/>
being so kind to her.<br/>
<br/>
She has very specific interests, not open to getting involved in just  <br/>
any old thing.<br/>
<br/>
She is choosy about who she spends time with.<br/>
<br/>
Only comfortable with a few other kids.<br/>
<br/>
School at home families put too low a priority on play time, so not  <br/>
available enough.<br/>
<br/>
School-at-home parents attitude frustrating to you because they don&#39;t  <br/>
want to help kids do what they want to do, and they don&#39;t want their  <br/>
kids to &quot;waste time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Your daughter has a hard time finding what she has in common with  <br/>
other kids.<br/>
<br/>
She is jealous of her brother&#39;s active social life.<br/>
<br/>
She keeps track of who is getting &quot;more&quot; and has a strong sense of  <br/>
when things seem unfair to her. She gets angry at the perceived  <br/>
unfairness. (Strong sense of justice.)<br/>
<br/>
She gets angry at you for not doing enough even when you feel you&#39;ve  <br/>
been giving her a lot of attention.<br/>
<br/>
She seems to most often like to do things on her own and often  <br/>
doesn&#39;t seem to want you to offer ideas or want you to be with her.<br/>
<br/>
You work at home and may sometimes not be aware of when she needs  <br/>
more of you.<br/>
<br/>
She is difficult to comfort when she&#39;s upset and you don&#39;t really  <br/>
know how to connect with her when she&#39;s upset.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1800868490">Yes, and thank you! I wasn&#39;t meaning to imply that your advice was <br/>
useless- I guess seeing what the issue wasn&#39;t started my mind rolling on <br/>
all the things that are wrapped up in our daily negotiations. It <br/>
certainly isn&#39;t simple! Thanks for your list, too. I am impressed and <br/>
grateful that you took the time to think about my situation!<br/>
<br/>
I tend to think that all my kids anger and unhappiness is due to me not <br/>
always having been a radical unschooling mom, and the fact that my <br/>
husband is just beginning to understand the concepts and still reverts <br/>
to strange ineffective and unnecessary parent behavior (it seems to me). <br/>
Which some of it certainly is and I don&#39;t want to exonerate myself, but <br/>
it helps to realize and talk(or type) about what is going on for my kids <br/>
and realizing there are circumstances, sometimes beyond my control, <br/>
sometimes things I can help with, that are underneath anger and <br/>
unhappiness. I simplify and don&#39;t take the time to understand- life is <br/>
so rushed at times with work and my son&#39;s busy schedule.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter right now especially is going through a time of transition, <br/>
with other anxieties involved in addition. I really need to pay <br/>
attention to what all is going on for her and really fill her up. <br/>
Sometimes she will wake up angry and want to be left alone, and I do <br/>
leave her alone and get involved in other things (of which there are <br/>
many, due to working at home) and don&#39;t make an effort to connect with <br/>
her until later in the day. I think it might be good to possibly try <br/>
again, even if my effort as connection is initially unwanted. I have <br/>
done this a couple of times recently and it has really helped. When she <br/>
is angry or sad at any time her pattern is to go into her room, <br/>
sometimes locking the door. I will ask her if she needs help, and if <br/>
not, leave her be, but I think staying with her a bit longer. or coming <br/>
back soon rather than getting wrapped up in work.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway- thanks so much!<br/>

how much you really care (as indicated by how quickly you give up on  <br/>

<br/>
When we ask kids if they want help, it means that they have to figure  <br/>

Maybe invite her to join YOU in doing something - rather than  <br/>
offering to help her. Just maybe give her the opportunity,  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1128561515">Thanks for the ideas, Pam. Coming back with different offers seems like <br/>
it might be a something to try. Sometimes it seems that she just might <br/>
need a good long time by herself before wanting company- but I do want <br/>
her to know that I care and am available.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I do also know how that is- that I just want someone to sense what <br/>
I need and do that- I don&#39;t want to have to ask. Since I don&#39;t know, and <br/>
what she needs isn&#39;t always the same, as the emotions have different <br/>
sources- I can make guesses and wait and try and guess again. Sometimes <br/>
writing a note to her will be a way she will respond rather than <br/>
answering a verbal question. Sometimes it will take several hours before <br/>
she is speaking again, sometimes she wakes up angry(I think because our <br/>
house is small and she is disturbed when my husband gets up for work?) <br/>
and will avoid me for a long time before talking to me in the morning. <br/>
Sometimes it is better that I wait for her to approach me.<br/>

Sometimes I feel so hurt by her angry response to me- if I can see the <br/>
reason for the anger it is easier.<br/>

<br/>
I meant to respond to this the first time.<br/>
<br/>
Duncan can wake up &quot;melting down&quot; if he lacks protein.<br/>
<br/>
Like, at the conference, he ate supper at 6:00pm. I didn&#39;t think to get <br/>
him something late, so he made do with crackers and Hershey bars late <br/>
at night. He&#39;d wake up melting down---crying and fussing and angry at <br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
I knew as soon as I spoke with him what was wrong. We discuss his <br/>
meltdowns, so he knew what was going on. I suggested that I fix him a <br/>
couple of eggs NOW. He gratefully agreed, ate, and was better in just a <br/>
*few* minutes.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe (and I could definitely be wrong), but maybe you should look at <br/>
her late night diet. See about making her a late night snack and/or <br/>
serving her breakfast in bed to see whether that would make a <br/>
difference.<br/>
<br/>
Surely she doesn&#39;t *like* waking up angry and difficult.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe play around---with her cooperation---with understanding why she <br/>
wakes up angry. I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll want to work with you! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

This technique works well for us.  Yesterday Fire went off to her room<br/>
rather upset when older sis expressed upset at her in front of group of<br/>
unschool teens we had at our house.  I sat outside Fires door (as she didn&#39;t<br/>
want me in when I knocked).  So I told her I would wait until she was ready<br/>
- this is not a new occurrence in our house.  And I grabbed my needlepoint,<br/>
sometimes I grab a book, but most often I use this as a time to relax<br/>
(meditate).  Then after a few minutes I&#39;ll suggest something we can do<br/>
together - it works better if the something that she wants to do rather than<br/>
something I *need* to do.  Yesterday we made troll boogers &lt;lol&gt;.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-286476397">The food thing is something to could pay more attention to. Since <br/>
relaxing controls on food protein is sometimes lacking- I need to come <br/>
up with some options for her that are more appealing. The cost is <br/>
sometimes an issue- the proteins she likes do tend to cost more than <br/>
other foods but I think I can figure some things out.<br/>
<br/>
Sitting outside her room when she doesn&#39;t want me to come in is <br/>
something I have done when she was younger- could try again. Our level <br/>
of busy-ness has gone up so much(which is itself is a big part of the <br/>
problem). I am trying to give away some responsibilities- however, <br/>
sometimes this takes a lot of effort which is why I haven&#39;t done it yet. <br/>
One step at a time. We are able to spend some satisfactory time together <br/>
everyday at some point and have been talking about how she feels and <br/>
possible reasons- not enough sleep or food is part of it, I suspect <br/>
hormones may be coming into play already too, on top of having not <br/>
enough of her own things going on in general. She had a great weekend <br/>
with her cousins and showed them how to make earrings. Her younger <br/>
cousin just quit the gymnastics team which may really be a great thing <br/>
for everyone- she&#39;ll have more energy and time to play.<br/>
<br/>
thanks so much- I expressed frustration about the situation to my <br/>
husband about the situation and his solution was to send her to school- <br/>
oh well.  I don&#39;t know where I would be without these lists!<br/>
