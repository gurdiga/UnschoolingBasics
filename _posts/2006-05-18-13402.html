<div id="ygrps-yiv-1923293220">I need to have an assessment done soon for my 9yo DS (per our state&#39;s <br/>

Thank you</div>

I also sent you an email!  I have something in Word I&#39;d be happy to <br/>
send you as an attachment (a list translating everyday activities into <br/>
educationese - maybe someone else knows how to find the site it came <br/>
from?)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-640414367">Hi,<br/>
I don&#39;t know where you are in WA but there is Family Learning<br/>
Organization, they offer Parent-administered Assessments. They also have<br/>
numbers for you to call if you have questions. Really friendly everytime<br/>
I called when I was pulling my kids out and paranoid I&#39;d do something<br/>
wrong! lol<br/>
<br/>
They are primarily about Natural Learning from what I can tell. Here is<br/>
a link, maybe it will help. :)<br/>
