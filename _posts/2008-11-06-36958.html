<div id="ygrps-yiv-237193231">I received this message this morning and thought the story was very<br/>
sweet!  She is less than 200 votes behind.  Maybe everyone can go help<br/>
her!<br/>

Hi everyone. I am asking your support by voting for my Someday Story.<br/>
I have a chance to <br/>
win 100K to finance my teen daughter&#39;s dream of expanding her magazine<br/>
business. I think <br/>
you&#39;ll find our story inspiring as you go about your homeschooling<br/>
journey. Time is running <br/>
out and I am behind. Deadline Monday, Nov. 10th. Please pass on to<br/>
your friends. Thanks!<br/>
Evelyn Krieger<br/>
Sharon, MA <br/>
