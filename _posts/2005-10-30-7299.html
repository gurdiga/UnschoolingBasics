<div id="ygrps-yiv-556092027">Someone asked at some point if I have figured out if we&#39;re <br/>
unschoolers or not.  I would say yes.  I just don&#39;t agree that in <br/>
every little thing we have ask our children what they want to do, if <br/>
they&#39;re okay with us going or doing this or that.   They lead the way <br/>
with their learning but I truly feel that the rest is about a <br/>
difference in parenting styles.  I do agree with not making arbitrary <br/>
rules and guidelines and considering your children&#39;s needs and <br/>
desires and not being controlling or &quot;having&quot; to do something just <br/>
because, no matter what.  But there are times where things do have to <br/>
be done and that is what being in a family is all about...going <br/>
places and working and doing things together as a family.  I guess I <br/>
would definitely not call ourselves as radical unschoolers but <br/>
unschoolers we are.  You don&#39;t have to have young children setting <br/>
bedtimes of midnight and beyond or change all plans because they&#39;re <br/>
refusing to go to the grocery store to be an unschooler. <br/>
<br/>
If I have misuderstood something somewhere and am incorrect I am <br/>
pretty sure someone will let me know (lol) but could we clarify where <br/>
things are a matter of unschooling or not unschooling and just the <br/>
way families and children are different in what they do?!<br/>

Well, this is the description of this list:<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;A list designed for those new to the philosophy of unschooling. Ask experienced unschoolers all those niggling questions, and find out how unschooling works in real families.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If you&#39;re familiar with John Holt&#39;s work but unsure of how to begin or what an unschooling day really looks like, this is a place for you to discuss, question, ponder, and become deeply familiar with natural learning and how it affects our entire lives. From parenting issues to learning from the whole wide world and beyond, come explore the issues that unschooling families have dealt with in the past and how to get beyond &quot;school-think&quot; to a joyful unschooling lifestyle!&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
We really DO consider parenting a large part of the unschooling lifestyle.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1716594597">I&#39;m a little late on this one because we are preparing for my 9 year olds<br/>
surgery tomorrow. <br/>
<br/>
---But there are times where things do have to <br/>
be done and that is what being in a family is all about...going <br/>

<br/>
Rebecca, I see where you are coming from totally. We live in families and<br/>
sometimes we have to make decisions as parents. You can&#39;t please everyone<br/>
all the time. Even as adults we have to do things we don&#39;t always feel like<br/>
doing at the time (laundry, making dinner, going to work, etc). I think it&#39;s<br/>
always important to consider everyone&#39;s feelings and needs and to talk with<br/>
our children about everything, but someone needs to lead. An example: I am<br/>
owner of a homeschool group with a co-op. Not everyone always loves the<br/>
decisions I have to make and I wish I could accommodate everyone all the<br/>
time but I can&#39;t. Someone has to make a decision. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you are talking about arbitrary rules at all. We don&#39;t make<br/>
arbitrary rules in our house either. We have carefully thought out<br/>
guidelines for the good of the family. The children have participated in<br/>
deciding a lot of these things so it&#39;s usually not an issue. <br/>
<br/>
I may be wrong, but I get the feeling that people are assuming that just<br/>
because parents might have guidelines or are willing to make decisions that<br/>
our children do not like that we don&#39;t have a loving, caring, respectful,<br/>
beautiful relationship with our children. That our home is somewhat of a war<br/>
zone of sorts. This just isn&#39;t true.  Granted it&#39;s rare, but sometimes I do<br/>
say, &quot;I&#39;m sorry that you don&#39;t agree but I feel ....&quot;  I do talk to my<br/>
children, as I&#39;m sure you do, and I will look for a way to accommodate their<br/>
wants but sometimes we all have to do things we don&#39;t want to do. Example: a<br/>
couple of weeks ago my daughter was sick and I needed to go to the store to<br/>
get her some cough medicine. My husband works nights so I can&#39;t wait until<br/>
he comes home. My son didn&#39;t want to come with me. He wanted to continue to<br/>
play his video game. I told him I would wait 15 minutes so he could finish.<br/>
Half an hour later he was arguing with me about going to the store. I talked<br/>
to him about how awful his sister felt and how I thought that if he felt<br/>
this way he would surely want me to get him some medicine. He kept arguing,<br/>
asking if it could wait till morning. I finally said, &quot;No, we have to go.<br/>
Please get in the car.&quot;   That&#39;s what I mean about making choices for the<br/>
family. Sometimes it&#39;s just not possible to accommodate everyone.<br/>
<br/>
I am finding that the more I talk to my children and ask how they feel or<br/>
what they would like to do, instead of telling them, that I find them making<br/>
better choices for themselves and the family in general. I am learning to<br/>
give them control over their lives and they are growing in so many ways.<br/>
When they learn something for experience they remember it and the experience<br/>
becomes a part of them and helps them make future decisions, rather than if<br/>
I had made the decision for them. Children learn from experience, just like<br/>
adults do. I try not to protect them from every consequence that is not a<br/>
life and death situation. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I assume you are wrong in that assumption about other peoples&#39;  <br/>
assumptions &lt;BEG&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
This discussion is really not at all about whether or not people can  <br/>
have loving, caring, respectful, beautiful relationships with their  <br/>
children in spite of parent-imposed rules/bedtimes/food controls, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I completely believe that Rebecca is having a great time and a great  <br/>
relationship with her children.<br/>
<br/>
I think unschooling is simply not doing school - not having lesson  <br/>
plans, &quot;teaching times,&quot; curriculum, assignments, tests, and grades.  <br/>
I believe the rest of what we&#39;re talking about is something amazing  <br/>
that people have learned mostly because they&#39;ve unschooled. When  <br/>
they&#39;ve trusted their kids to learn to read when and how they&#39;re  <br/>
ready, when they&#39;ve trusted their kids to learn without coercion, it  <br/>
is a very logical extension to think that kids can also learn non- <br/>
academic things in a more natural, less coercive, way, too.<br/>
<br/>
So that&#39;s what has happened and that&#39;s what we&#39;re talking about.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re not &quot;doing school&quot; and you ARE supporting your children&#39;s  <br/>
interests and you&#39;re creating a rich and inviting and stimulating  <br/>
environment, then you&#39;re unschooling.  You can call it that or not -  <br/>
doesn&#39;t matter.<br/>
<br/>
I think of the rest - all the stuff about trusting kids in regard to  <br/>
learning about other aspects of life - as &quot;advanced unschooling.&quot; It  <br/>
is like grad school (woops, a school analogy to explain unschooling -  <br/>
that&#39;s weird). &lt;G&gt;.<br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
Sure. Last night my kids wanted to eat some of their Halloween candy. Well,<br/>
some turned into quite a bit. I said, &quot;Careful with that stuff guys. You<br/>
might get a tummy ache.&quot; I did not say &quot;Ok guys, that&#39;s enough. Put the<br/>
candy away&quot; like I would have a few months ago. They continued to eat and<br/>
eat. (We do have candy in our house and they are free to have it whenever<br/>
they want but they don&#39;t eat much by choice)Anyway, they both ended up with<br/>
tummy aches and my son had diarrhea as well as not being able to sleep. I<br/>
nursed them through their tummy aches and never said &quot;I told you so.&quot; This<br/>
morning they both told me that they never wanted candy again. Of course they<br/>
will, but I think the EXPERIENCE has taught them something about moderation.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This has been a real tough one for me. As a mom I want to protect them but I<br/>
have realized that this is not always what&#39;s best for them. <br/>

Sure. Last night my kids wanted to eat some of their Halloween candy. Well,<br/>
some turned into quite a bit. I said, &quot;Careful with that stuff guys. You<br/>
might get a tummy ache.&quot; I did not say &quot;Ok guys, that&#39;s enough. Put the<br/>
candy away&quot; like I would have a few months ago. They continued to eat and<br/>
eat. (We do have candy in our house and they are free to have it whenever<br/>
they want but they don&#39;t eat much by choice)Anyway, they both ended up with<br/>
tummy aches and my son had diarrhea as well as not being able to sleep. I<br/>
nursed them through their tummy aches and never said &quot;I told you so.&quot; This<br/>
morning they both told me that they never wanted candy again. Of course they<br/>
will, but I think the EXPERIENCE has taught them something about moderation.<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
OK. I think the big difference here is that I would have set out a platter of carrots and dip, sliced apples and caramel sauce, steamed edamame, some nuts, and some sliced meats and cheeses *along* with that big bowl of candy. My children would have eaten a bit of everything (and ALL the edamame would be gone!) and wouldn&#39;t have gotten tummyaches because they would have had choices *other* than just Milky Ways or Milk Duds.<br/>
 <br/>
They *get* to make wise choices and aren&#39;t forced to eat as much candy as they can to be filled up. They have *something* to moderate.<br/>
 <br/>
At our Halloween party last Sunday, there was enough candy to choke a horse, but I also offered teriyaki bat wings, deviled ham tombstone sandwiches, carrots and dill dip, celery and bleu cheese dip, Devil&#39;s food cupcakes, and popcorn---with spider cider. Everything was eaten equally---because it was all good! &lt;g&gt; <br/>
 <br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
This has been a real tough one for me. As a mom I want to protect them but I<br/>
have realized that this is not always what&#39;s best for them. <br/>
 <br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
It shouldn&#39;t be so tough. And your JOB is to protect them. <br/>

That must have been a LOT of candy consumption, to the exclusion of <br/>
anything else, for them to have had such reactions.  I can&#39;t imagine <br/>

right sock was bothering him, so he took it off. I could have tried <br/>
to make him wear it. I could have then told him he &quot;had to&quot; take off <br/>
the other one also. Instead, I tucked his other sock in the bottom <br/>
of the spare treat bag (his costume had a treat bucket that was kind <br/>
of small so we brought along a spare bag - the L&L conference tote <br/>
as a matter of fact - to handle overflow) and he trick or treated <br/>
one sock on one sock off quite happily. The other sock was there <br/>
should he decide he needed it.<br/>

I can understand that you might not be able to imagine it but kids who will eat sugar to almost the exclusion of anything else do exist.  I live with one.  For several years, he ate almost nothing besides sugar-filled, highly processed food.  He went into malnutrition while I kept talking to him about nutrition and offering options.  I kept hearing things like the above and thinking I am just somehow doing it wrong.  I finally wised up and realized that Zach has a problem and I needed to deal with it even if it went against the &quot;party line&quot;.  I believe in radical unschooling, it works quite well for most of my kids but Zach is 12 now and I still haven&#39;t figured out a way to make unschooling and sugar go hand in hand for him.<br/>

<br/>
I think the phrase &quot;eat sugar to almost the exclusion of anything <br/>
else&quot; is misleading.  It sounds from the rest of the paragraph like <br/>
he craved very specific things with a high sugar content, <br/>
not &quot;sugar&quot; by itself.  I&#39;m drinking a fruit smoothie as I type <br/>
this, and it probably has as much sugar in it as a packaged, <br/>
processed pastry.  When I was a child my father called me a &quot;sugar <br/>
addict&quot; because I loved ice cream and candy bars.  But I detested <br/>
soda, which is higher in sugar than either of those, and it used to <br/>
disgust me that my sister could eat straight sugar (chew a sugar <br/>
cube for example).  So was I really a &quot;sugar addict&quot;?  Is a <br/>
breastfed baby a sugar addict?  (Human milk is very sugary- I think <br/>
we&#39;re hardwired for sweetness).<br/>
<br/>
Most sugary foods have lots of other ingredients.  I find that when <br/>
I do eat ice cream or chocolate (which I still love as an adult) I <br/>
feel better afterwards- less sluggish- if there is some nuts or <br/>
protein in there.  For example, peanut m&ms rather than plain m&ms, <br/>
or butter pecan ice cream rather than cookie dough.  The protein <br/>
seems, for me, to minimize or eliminate the rush/crash cycle that I <br/>
tend to get from pure starch.  I also prefer, when I have the time, <br/>
to make things like cookies from scratch- preferably with organic <br/>
ingredients and protein in there somewhere.     <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Try these Patti, they&#39;re &#39;cookies&#39; but end up more like tiny muffins <br/>
almost. Fruit, yogurt, protein, whole grains all in a handy, <br/>
portable package.<br/>
<br/>
PB Cookies <br/>
3/4C yogurt or yogurt cheese (drained or undrained is okay, <br/>
undrained might need a dash more flour in the end)<br/>
1/2C peanut butter <br/>
3/4C mashed banana<br/>
1 tsp baking powder <br/>
1/2 tsp baking soda <br/>
2 eggs <br/>
1 tsp vanilla <br/>
1 1/4C whole wheat flour<br/>
2C rolled oats (basic Quaker oatmeal) <br/>
<br/>
raisins, peanuts, chocolate chips (whichever you want to use -- <br/>
we&#39;ve used all or none or an assortment whatever was on hand) <br/>
<br/>
Mix everything in a big bowl, stirring well after each addition. <br/>
Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls onto an ungreased baking sheet. Bake at <br/>
375 for about 10 minutes or until edges are lightly browned and the <br/>
top pops back when lightly pressed. Makes about 5 dozen cookies <br/>

was probably 4 yrs or so ago) when he wore his fire engine red <br/>
galoshes/boots everywhere every day for months - right through the <br/>
summer even (made my feet sweaty just looking at them but he was okay).<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one thing DS always puts on his list of things he likes about <br/>
being home instead of school - he can just stay naked all day if he <br/>
wants to. A few weeks ago I was heading to the grocery store and asked <br/>
if he wanted to come (it was evening, after dinner, and he generally <br/>
likes to come with me) and he said No thanks - he had been naked all <br/>
day and didn&#39;t feel like getting clothes on. And there have been times <br/>
when he just tossed on a pair of sweatpants or shorts in the morning <br/>
and spent the day out and about &quot;commando&quot; (sans underpants). Seems to <br/>
be a Y chromosome thing in our house since both DH and FIL prefer <br/>
minimal clothing whenever possible (hmm TMI??lol)<br/>
