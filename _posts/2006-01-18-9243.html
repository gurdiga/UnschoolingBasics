<div id="ygrps-yiv-1052844360">&quot;I have always thought that watching TV all day fell in the same<br/>
category as eating chocolate or ice cream all day, something that even<br/>
as an unschooler I wouldn&#39;t allow - &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think you should try that for 2-3 days. Try watching tv all day and<br/>
eating only ice cream or chocolate. You&#39;ll be so sick of it after your<br/>
little experiment, you&#39;ll not want any of it for a while.<br/>
<br/>
If you make certain things &quot;dessert&quot;, then they&#39;ll get treated as more<br/>
desirable. If it&#39;s all just part of life, it loses the fascination<br/>
very quickly and becomes another choice in a wide array of choices.<br/>
<br/>
What keeps adults from eating chocolate constantly?...we now have the<br/>
choice and power to do so. Kids don&#39;t want to feel yucky either.<br/>
They might try it for a while, until they trust you not to limit<br/>
it...but the fascination will die down.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-840806009">&quot;I wouldn&#39;t sit by and let my children<br/>
try cocaine, and I couldn&#39;t live with myself as a mother if I allowed a<br/>
steady diet of TV.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not really a good comparison. Cocaine is illegal and proven to<br/>
be harmful.<br/>
<br/>
There are NO good studies on television to show it&#39;s harmful,<br/>
especially in an unschooling context.<br/>
<br/>
Each family has to find their balance of course, but we&#39;ve found that<br/>
trusting children in all areas, leads to more learning and joyful<br/>
exploration.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-65823577">&quot;There&#39;s a huge difference neurologically between  <br/>
people who are blanking out in front of the screen and families who  <br/>
are actively engaged in what they are seeing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You know, if my kids are really interested in a show, they&#39;re very<br/>
focused. But more often than not, they&#39;re doing ten things at once.<br/>
They&#39;ll walk away from a show right in the middle (something I NEVER<br/>
would have done as a child) to play a game. They often play games<br/>
while watching something and acting out shows is a favorite activity<br/>
around here. Sierra will come up with costumes to represent characters<br/>
in shows, make up little skits etc... I can SEE the neurons firing away.:)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Of course, we also eat dessert before dinner, so take it the way you  <br/>
want. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
We almost always put dessert out WITH dinner. It&#39;s just another choice<br/>
of all the foods. Jalen ate only dessert one night (it had fruit,<br/>
butter, eggs so he still got good stuff) but he&#39;s also been known to<br/>
eat only brocolli! You never know...but dessert isn&#39;t more desirable<br/>
usually, unless it&#39;s something I haven&#39;t made for a while.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I got a good lesson in this one over the holidays. One Saturday I <br/>
set out to make some sugar cookies to decorate - that holiday baking <br/>
thang. DS helped out as he chose (decorating and such). As the <br/>
cookies were coming out of the oven, he said &quot;What are these cookies <br/>
for?&quot; I said &quot;For us to eat&quot; and he got the hugest grin! Took me a <br/>
bit aback as I realized that many times I&#39;ll bake cookies or <br/>
whatever because we&#39;re taking them to a gathering of some kind (a <br/>
birthday, a holiday gathering, a potluck, etc). Then and there I <br/>
mentally vowed to make more cookies &quot;just for us&quot;. So a week or so <br/>
later (post holiday craziness), I made a batch of chocolate chip <br/>
cookies after dinner one evening. DS was thrilled and ate a bunch of <br/>
them - probably 1/3 of the cookies were gone by the time I was done <br/>
with the baking and cleaning up. Since then, I&#39;ve made more cookies <br/>
at least once a week, sometimes more often depending on how things <br/>
are going. Last night I made yet another batch. He ate maybe 4 over <br/>
the course of about 2 hours and stopped. He&#39;s content knowing that <br/>
I&#39;ll make more readily, he can ask if he wants some on a particular <br/>
night and if at all possible (ingredients and time available), I&#39;ll <br/>
make them - and if not that night, then I&#39;ll do it the next <br/>
available time (the next evening usually). They&#39;ve lost that allure <br/>
of something &quot;special&quot; and &quot;limited&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1483141689">&quot;If some people have found that their kids respond differently, that&#39;s<br/>
fine by me. I&#39;m not out to convert anyone to my way of thinking, only to<br/>
let folks know that there is more than one way for things to work. Every<br/>
family is different, and every child is different. In my house, we&#39;re<br/>
all a lot happier if the TV isn&#39;t on too much.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hmmmm, you sound just like me five or six years ago!!<br/>
What you aren&#39;t realizing, is many of us felt the same way, had the<br/>
same attitudes and found we were DEAD WRONG.<br/>
So telling us that there&#39;s more than one way to think, is preaching to<br/>
the choir! We know. We&#39;ve learned differently and are simply sharing<br/>
the difference.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not out to convert anyone. I don&#39;t have to live in anyone elses<br/>
house, with anyone elses kids. I really could care less what different<br/>
homes do.<br/>
What I DO care about, is showing people that there are alternatives to<br/>
mainstream views, that there are other options than villifying tv.<br/>
<br/>
My experience time and time again (after talking to literally hundreds<br/>
of families) is that the &quot;effects&quot; of television are really effects of<br/>
fear of loss, control and a parent not providing the needed framework<br/>
around lots of television viewing (ie; bringing them food, watching<br/>
with them, being available to smooth things out etc..)<br/>
<br/>
Parents that limit, tend to leave the kids to the television for<br/>
longer periods of time, then wonder why meltdowns are happening (it<br/>
takes time for human beings to start walking away from something they<br/>
think will get taken away eventually).<br/>
<br/>
They need you present. They need food at regular intervals, they need<br/>
you to be interested in what they&#39;re watching, they need offers of<br/>
other activities that might soothe them....they need your presence and<br/>
lack of judgement.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not necessary that we all agree. It&#39;s not necessary that you<br/>
begin to allow unlimited television...it doesn&#39;t affect whether you&#39;re<br/>
an unschooler or not.  Take what you want from the list, leave the<br/>
rest behind.  But lots of us will share our experience of going from<br/>
exactly what you described above, to kids that are not affected by<br/>
television negatively AND walk away from it quite often (or never turn<br/>
it on at all).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1982689811">&quot;True learning happens when kids get to<br/>
interact with stuff that is meaningful to them. Tv is just one tool in<br/>
making that happen. It makes their world bigger, it seems to me, lack<br/>
of tv would make their world smaller.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I agree.  But there was a time when I thought tv robbed us, that it<br/>
made us act negatively (my attitude was the only negative thing<br/>
really) and it turned their creativity off.<br/>
<br/>
Was I ever wrong!! I am amazed by the creative ideas my kids get<br/>
going, based on some &quot;spark&quot; from a show or ad.<br/>
<br/>
The other night, I was snuggled up with Jalen (on his doggie pillow:)<br/>
and he tells me he wants a &quot;fisher stick&quot;.<br/>
HUH?<br/>
So I asked him questions about what a &quot;fisher stick&quot; does, and how it<br/>
works and he describes to me in great detail:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I want a fisher stick and you put a hooker on the wope and put it<br/>
down in the water and the hooker catches a fish and you use the<br/>
spinner thing and get the fish, then you cut it up and put it on the<br/>
fire (at which point he says &quot;like this&quot; and shows me with big hand<br/>
motions what the fire looks like) and eat it. That&#39;s COOL!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So if you haven&#39;t figured it out, he wants a fishing pole and to cook<br/>
and eat the fish over an open fire. We need to go camping!!<br/>
It was an ad he saw on television that sparked the whole idea.....now<br/>
we need to go catch that kid some poor fish.;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1304943699">Oh, me too!  We didn&#39;t even have a TV for the longest time. Then hubby&#39;s<br/>
teen sister moved in with us with her TV.  We started with lots of controls<br/>
and restrictions. I just knew if allowed to watch TV as much as they wanted<br/>
they would make bad choices, watch too much, succumb to the &quot;I wants&quot;<br/>
because of commercials.....as we began our slow change to unschooling, I<br/>
learned how wrong I was. Our process to unschooling took quite a few<br/>
years.....but our youngest has always been unschooled and never had TV<br/>
restrictions or regulations (besides that of being involved and interested<br/>
in what he was watching). He is the least likely to watch TV and has never<br/>
wanted to watch anything inappropriate for his age.  I just knew my ideas<br/>
were right and good. I only wanted what was best for my kids. But I was<br/>
willing to question why I believed what I did and this allowed me to see a<br/>
different way to view a lot of things. It didn&#39;t happen over-night, change<br/>
came slowly and in little steps, but it did come. And I am so glad.<br/>

My daughter can watch anything she wants, has always been able to. We  <br/>
had cable and now satellite so she&#39;s had access to plenty of things  <br/>
parents wouldn&#39;t let their kids watch. Because she can try things  <br/>
out, because she can bail out, because she knows I&#39;m there to help  <br/>
her if she has problems, she safely explores and understands her own  <br/>
limits. I use <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.screenit.com">http://www.screenit.com</a> to help her know what&#39;s in a  <br/>
movie before we see it. (It told me enough that I could tell her when  <br/>
to cover her eyes during Lord of the Rings.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m her partner, not her guard. She knows if she wants to try  <br/>
something that&#39;s at the limits of her sensitivity, I&#39;ll be there to  <br/>
help her.<br/>

Mine isn&#39;t about violence, but the question is driven by similar<br/>
concerns.  How about other things, like sex or race?  <br/>
I&#39;m a big fan of Dave Chappelle.  I really enjoy his comedy and his<br/>
show.  I like the way he portrays race issues and the questions that<br/>
can arise.  I don&#39;t know that this question is neccesarily about Dave<br/>
Chappelle, but he is someone who has very recently given me pause in<br/>

issues have been dealt with.  If it helps, my boys are 7 and almost 3.</div>

<br/>
Do they want to watch movies with sex in them?<br/>
<br/>
Helping them means helping them find what they enjoy -- and avoid  <br/>
what they have no interest in. You don&#39;t need to show them everything  <br/>
in the world if it wouldn&#39;t appeal to them. Just as you don&#39;t need to  <br/>
make your husband watch Brokeback Mountain to make sure he has full  <br/>
freedom ;-)<br/>
<br/>
When my daughter was younger we saved the movies with more sexual  <br/>
content, more violence than she liked, and talky movies to times when  <br/>
she was off with friends.<br/>
<br/>
When my daughter was very young we watched The Truth About Cats and  <br/>
Dogs which was funny enough for her to enjoy it though there was one  <br/>
scene where they were having phone sex and my husband said to my  <br/>
daughter &quot;Hey, let&#39;s go get some dessert,&quot; and they both trotted off  <br/>
to the kitchen. The scene wouldn&#39;t have meant anything to her but  <br/>
might have raised questions that neither of us felt competent to  <br/>
answer in terms she understood. It&#39;s okay to distract! :-)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also okay if they want to watch something you&#39;re uncomfortable  <br/>
with to share with them why you feel uncomfortable so the two of you  <br/>
can figure out how to handle it. Maybe you&#39;ll want to skip past  <br/>
something. Maybe you&#39;ll want to stop and talk about something.  <br/>
There&#39;s lots of options between plopping them in front of something  <br/>
and being a roadblock between them and it.<br/>

<br/>
Oh that&#39;s too funny Joyce. ROTFLMAO!! My dear sweet enlightened husband has voiced his desire many times to NEVER see Brokeback Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
As far as stuff like Dave Chappelle goes, we love him too. But his humor is very satirical and could be misunderstood and mimicked in a way we wouldn&#39;t want. We&#39;ve always evaluated on a show by show basis. Some things we&#39;d watch when the kids weren&#39;t around, some things we&#39;d distract or fast forward during. Most times thought we&#39;d talk A LOT about what was on the screen. With Dave Chappelle, it&#39;s important that my kids understand where the humor is coming from and what I think he&#39;s trying to accomplish with his satire. Weve had some great discussions about racism because of his shows. <br/>
<br/>
I feel the same way about South Park. Of course my kids are older. At ages 7 and 3 we watched much tamer stuff most of the time. Although we did introduce Mel Brooks pretty early on. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&quot;Just today I&#39;m going to be utterly present for my children, I&#39;m going to be in their world (not just doing my own thing while they do theirs), I&#39;m going to really hear them, I&#39;m going to prepare myself to be present starting right now.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL! We introduced Monty Python at the same time to all the kids,  <br/>
meaning Josh was about eight, while the girls were five and four.  <br/>
We&#39;ve enjoyed watching it together, the dry humor has been fun, and  <br/>
explaining why mommy and daddy thought weird parts were funny. The  <br/>
only time I&#39;ve regretted it was during &quot;The Life of Brian&quot; when the  <br/>
girls got a full frontal. of course, they&#39;d seen their bro nakie  <br/>
enough times that they weren&#39;t shocked, but I did kind of do the  <br/>
mommy wince, wondering if that was completely inappropriate.<br/>
<br/>
josh has loved Mel Brooks movies, which is funny because his  <br/>
aspergers keeps him from understanding a lot of the subtlety. of  <br/>
course, we&#39;ve used it to teach a lot of that too.<br/>

<br/>
Well, his father has a thing for &quot;slasher&quot; flicks like Halloween and such...<br/>
I don&#39;t think any five year old needs to see that kind of film. Yes, he does<br/>
watch shows and movies that other parents wouldn&#39;t allow their children to<br/>
watch. Him and his father watch Simpson&#39;s nightly which appalls my<br/>
step-mother that I let him watch it and yes we have had to have discussions<br/>
about using intelligent words not &quot;what the-!&quot; He hasn&#39;t even finished the<br/>
sentence because Homer never does but I don&#39;t think it is appropriate<br/>
language and while I do have my bought of unintelligent explicates we all<br/>
work toward intelligent choose of words.<br/>
<br/>
Quentin watches all of the Hero movies even HellBoy which opened a whole<br/>
discussion about Heaven and Hell and that some people believe there is a<br/>
place that bad people go and a place that good people go when they die.<br/>
<br/>
After watching Indiana Jones: the Temple of Doom... We discussed that there<br/>
were movies that Quentin probably shouldn&#39;t watch just now. We did get him<br/>
to watch until the end. My sister&#39;s suggestion that watching a movie even if<br/>
it is scary that if you see it to the end usually ends with a &quot;good&quot; ending<br/>
and will help clear the scary part. Since I knew that Indiana beat the bad<br/>
guys and saved the day, we decided to watch until the end and he hid his<br/>
eyes when he got scared.<br/>
<br/>
There have been movies that he has asked over and over to watch and I have<br/>
discussed with him that it might scare him and that he might want to wait to<br/>
see these movies until he is older. We had the discussion over and over<br/>
about Van Helsing and eventually he said that it was okay if it was scary<br/>
that he really wanted to see it and that we would be here if he got too<br/>
scared and could turn it off.<br/>
<br/>
Now, he can tell you the story with enthusiasm which he does every time<br/>
because he can&#39;t remember the name of the movie.<br/>
<br/>
I guess that there isn&#39;t much I don&#39;t let him see but there are a few that I<br/>
warm him of and most of it is that discussion with my DH that the movie<br/>
isn&#39;t one we should watch while cuddling with the kids in from of the Telly.<br/>

My daughter can watch anything she wants, has always been able to. We  <br/>
had cable and now satellite so she&#39;s had access to plenty of things  <br/>
parents wouldn&#39;t let their kids watch. Because she can try things  <br/>
out, because she can bail out, because she knows I&#39;m there to help  <br/>
her if she has problems, she safely explores and understands her own  <br/>
limits. I use <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.screenit.com">http://www.screenit.com</a> to help her know what&#39;s in a  <br/>
movie before we see it. (It told me enough that I could tell her when  <br/>
to cover her eyes during Lord of the Rings.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m her partner, not her guard. She knows if she wants to try  <br/>
something that&#39;s at the limits of her sensitivity, I&#39;ll be there to  <br/>
help her.<br/>
