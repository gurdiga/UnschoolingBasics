<br/>
Several years ago a friend of mine and I started a<br/>
list of the odd things we say to our kids and the odd<br/>
things our kids say. We had lots of &quot;everyday<br/>
oddness&quot;: things like &quot;You shouldn&#39;t stand on your<br/>
sister&quot;. But some of my favorites were &quot;We don&#39;t shave<br/>
the cats&quot; and my friend&#39;s daughter singing &quot;Let&#39;s Go<br/>
Fly A Kite&quot; from Mary Poppins. The actual words are<br/>
&quot;Up to the atmosphere, up where the air is clear&quot;, but<br/>
she was singing &quot;Up to fly up yours, let&#39;s go fly up<br/>
yours&quot;. LOL<br/>
<br/>
With kids around who needs television! Kids are so<br/>
much more entertaining!<br/>
