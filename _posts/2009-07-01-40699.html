<div id="ygrps-yiv-758252474">Probably you&#39;ve heard this at least on TV.  Geiko uses it in their<br/>
caveman ad campaign but I love it.  And I although it&#39;s likely about a<br/>
bad relationship, when I hear it I think about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Let Me Be Myself&quot;<br/>
3 Doors Down<br/>
<br/>
I guess i just got lost<br/>
Bein&#39; someone else<br/>
I tried to kill the pain<br/>
Nothin ever helped<br/>
I left myself behind<br/>
Somewhere along the way<br/>
Hopin to come back around<br/>
To find myself someday<br/>
<br/>
Lately i&#39;m so tired of waiting for you<br/>
To say that it&#39;s ok, but tell me<br/>
Please, would you one time<br/>
Just let me be myself<br/>
So i can shine with my own light<br/>
Let me be myself<br/>
Would you let me be myself<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll never find my heart<br/>
Behind someone else<br/>
I&#39;ll never see the light of day<br/>
Living in this cell<br/>
It&#39;s time to make my way<br/>
Into the world i knew<br/>
Take back all of these times<br/>
That i gave in to you<br/>
<br/>
Lately i&#39;m so tired of waiting for you<br/>
To say that it&#39;s ok, but tell me<br/>
Please, would you one time<br/>
Let me be myself<br/>
So i can shine with my own light<br/>
And let me be myself<br/>
For a while, if you don&#39;t mind<br/>
Let me be myself<br/>
So i can shine with my own light<br/>
Let me be myself<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all i&#39;ve ever wanted from this world<br/>
Is to let me be me<br/>
<br/>
Please would you one time<br/>
Let me be myself<br/>
So i can shine with my own light<br/>
Let me be myself<br/>
Please would you one time<br/>
Let me be myself<br/>
So i can shine with my own light<br/>
Let me be myself<br/>
For a while, if you don&#39;t mind<br/>
Let me be myself<br/>
So i can shine with my own light<br/>
Let me be myself<br/>
Would you one time... oooh<br/>
Let me be myself<br/>
Let me be me<br/>
<br/>
