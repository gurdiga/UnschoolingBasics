<div id="ygrps-yiv-120993257">My husband died last year.  I was a stay at home wife and mother.  I put my daughter in public kindergarten (she is 5 and will turn 6 in July) so I have time to breathe, grieve and take college classes.  I will need to find a way to make money so we can survive.  I am on my own with her.  My mother, who is almost 80 and lives an hour away, is helpful but is also deep in grief as my dad died soon after my husband. <br/>
<br/>
What are some options?  I do not agree with what is going on in public school.  I am not allowed to visit the school and see what is going on in the classroom.  My daughter is changing in ways and so unhappy.  <br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?  What can I do in the future to earn a living?  How can I have time for me while homeschooling?  How do you keep your patience?  How do you do it?  Where do you start?  What about alternative schools?  These are questions I have.  I live on Long Island, NY.  Thank you.</div>

 </span></blockquote>I wish I could be more helpful, but I did want to say, in CA it is the law that a parent or guardian can observe a 1/2 hour a day.  I don&#39;t know if that is every day. While it&#39;s possible, I have trouble believing NY is so different. This is clearly not a subject for an unschooling discussion board to cover in depth, but please do look into your rights more locally. Maybe you could try the NY Dept of Education General Information line at (518) 474-3852.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck-<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You said you&#39;re taking some college classes - is she able to sit in? That&#39;s something some 5yos could do, but certainly not all. Can you afford any childcare at all? Enough to take your classes? Can you remain home on public aid where you live? Where I am you can get food stamps if you&#39;re unemployed but welfare is harder. Can you live with family or friends for awhile, with the understanding that you want to &quot;homeschool&quot; and may not be able to work for a few years?<br/>
<br/>
In terms of work itself, how are you on taxes? Seriously, if you don&#39;t flinch at the actual paperwork you can make a certain amount of money each year just doing others taxes for them.<br/>

might be a start.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you can partner up with another mom/child duo and move in together <br/>
to share expenses.<br/>
<br/>
If you own your own house, can you rent it out and live in a cheaper place?<br/>

too well how acute your pain in that first year, the adjustment to being in<br/>
Holland instead of Italy (<br/>

the help of a great couple of friends, to grieve with the least amount of<br/>
arbitrary stress as possible to the kids.  I imagine it&#39;s much like what<br/>
school is providing for you now, a private time for you to be with your own<br/>
grief.<br/>

can&#39;t imagine how hard it must be for her to be surrounded by strangers, who<br/>
have no idea what&#39;s going on in her head or her heart... It was very<br/>
important to me to have my children with someone *at all times* who was a<br/>
loved one, a trusted person to our family.  I know now how hard the whole<br/>
Daddy conversation has been for Hayden (now 11), I&#39;m glad I shielded him<br/>
when he was very small and our pain was acute.  She definitely needs a safe<br/>
place, a safe outlet; where she can be happy or sad according to her own<br/>
needs. I held in my heart the importance that my children lose *ONE* parent,<br/>
not both.<br/>

money, enough to have a happy life for the three of us.  We did have amazing<br/>
support of my family and friends; we were fortunate to build this community<br/>
over the length of my husband&#39;s illness. Two years ago, I began working<br/>
2x/week as a baker for a local cafe; it&#39;s a late night shift, Hayden has the<br/>
option of coming with me or being 3 minutes away at home.  A year ago, I<br/>
started working at the local university as an interpreter (my pre-mommy<br/>
profession). We are now far from our genetic family and living in a<br/>
community that is very supportive of unschooling *&* my quirkiness ;)<br/>

How do you keep your patience?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>**My patience didn&#39;t go anywhere and it won&#39;t. I&#39;ve no need to keep it.<br/>
And that really is the conversation I have with myself. Patience is<br/>
infinite; you cannot run out, you cannot lose it. Forget to use? yes indeed.<br/>
Practice helps. Breathing helps. Counting helps. Parenting<br/>
Peacefully&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/parentingpeacefully">http://sandradodd.com/parentingpeacefully</a>&gt;*really* helped.<br/>
<br/>
How do you do it? Where do you start?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>**Pretend everyday is summer vacation. That is the very best place to start.<br/>
Today even. Right now!<br/>
<br/>
What about alternative schools?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>**I knew/know school is not the answer to what is not going smoothly in my<br/>
life.  *I* am the answer. And it&#39;s a lot of work. Still, I&#39;d not do it any<br/>
other way. ((((hugs))))<br/>
