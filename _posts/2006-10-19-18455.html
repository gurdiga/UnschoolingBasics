<div id="ygrps-yiv-1722075911">~~I agree that knowing some phonics helps decode new<br/>
words while reading books. But a child who&#39;s made it<br/>
to that level of reading will have gathered some<br/>
phonics on the way anyway. I&#39;m just not convinced that<br/>
it&#39;s a good starting point for every child.~~<br/>
<br/>
I agree.<br/>
Jared (13) learned to read without a lot of questions about anything.<br/>
From the time he was very little, he would bring us his pokemon cards<br/>
or whatever needed deciphering and ask us to read it to him. We read<br/>
to him.<br/>
That&#39;s IT.<br/>
He never wanted to know the letter sounds and the couple of times I<br/>
tried to explain it, he totally shut down. NOT interested.<br/>
<br/>
He started reading and writing spontaneously this year. Very well I<br/>
might add. Over the last year or so, he would occasionally ask &quot;Does<br/>
the letter ____ make this sound?&quot; and we would discuss how it made<br/>
that sound (or didn&#39;t, or what exceptions there were).<br/>
<br/>
So until he could already read, he had no use for letter sounds. Now<br/>
he understands a lot of them by default. Trying to show him phonics<br/>
would not have helped this child, it just would have been a stumbling<br/>
block to his own process.  This same child could grasp large numbers<br/>
and how the place values worked at a very young age.<br/>
<br/>
So.....phonics awareness eventually happens. Doesn&#39;t mean we need to<br/>
&quot;teach&quot; phonics, nor is that the best way for some kids to learn<br/>
decoding skills. It has the potential to slow them down if that isn&#39;t<br/>
going to &#39;click&#39; for them.<br/>
<br/>
Sierra, by age 4-5 wanted to know letter sounds. She asked what<br/>
letters made which sounds over and over and we DID do phonics style<br/>
learning because she wanted to know. There was never a lesson or any<br/>
agenda on my part, I was simply with her, exploring language in HER way.<br/>
<br/>
Her reading process was much more laborious and lengthy compared to<br/>
Jared. Each learner needs space to figure it out in their own way.<br/>
