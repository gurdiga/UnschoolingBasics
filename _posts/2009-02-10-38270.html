<div id="ygrps-yiv-1041666231">HI Cindy, <br/>
I got your email from the unschooling basics list. I&#39;m just wondering if you have any more <br/>
info re: the conference. I am the mama to three unschooled littles, and we have a <br/>
community of unschooly folks in Saskatoon. I know I, and probably a few others, would love <br/>
any more info about the conference. I was so excited to read of a conference within easy <br/>
travelling distance that our family could plan to attend. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks, <br/>
Anno</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-535720929">Hi Anno!<br/>
<br/>
Cool!  Thanks for your interest!  I&#39;m tickled to anticipate welcoming <br/>
a contingent of you from Saskatoon!  The Delta Calgary South, where <br/>
the conference is being hosted, is a beautiful hotel, with pools, <br/>
waterslide, wireless internet, generous host rooms for our group, an <br/>
amazing restaurant and a very comfortable, modern aesthetic.  Y&#39;all <br/>
will be so comfortable calling it home base from out of town!  But <br/>
that&#39;s not the best part!  I&#39;ve got an awesome lineup of speakers I&#39;m <br/>
so proud to assemble for our inaugral Calgary Unschooling Conference:<br/>
<br/>
Lisa Rouleau, owner/founder of the Unschooling Canada yahoo <br/>
discussion forum<br/>
Judy Arnall, non-punitive parenting expert, educator and author, (and <br/>
my first unschooling mentor &lt;G&gt;)<br/>
Jay Fiset, of Personal Best Seminars, (another personal mentor of <br/>
mine who has such clear and supportive ideals on empowered <br/>
accountability, so very congruent with the ideal in unschooling)<br/>
Suze Casey, founder of Belief Repatterning, (another personal mentor <br/>
of mine who will support us all with a tangible method for aligning <br/>
our less than conscious beliefs that may stand in the way of our <br/>
willingness or capacity to fully embrace radical unschooling <br/>
principles)<br/>
... and me!  I&#39;m not decided for certain yet what my speaking topic <br/>
will be.  What I know for sure is that I have a deep heart of passion <br/>
for this non-conforming, free life of self-directed learning and <br/>
growing.  I had such an inspired experience speaking at Pam&#39;s Living <br/>
Joyfully Toronto Unschooling Conference last May and I look so <br/>
forward to many more speaking opportunities to share my passion, and <br/>
to inspire interested others with my conviction.<br/>
<br/>
The conference happens September 18-20, 2009.  The website will be <br/>
live shortly and of course I&#39;ll be posting that info here the moment <br/>
that happens.  <br/>
<br/>
Alphabet Soup is going to be a sell-out conference:  interest is <br/>
buzzing, the scale of the homeschooling and unschooling community in <br/>
Calgary and Alberta at large is huge, the easy urban access of the <br/>
hosting venue, (ok, fine, suburban, &lt;G&gt;) and the fact that the timing <br/>
is just right for this inaugral unschooling Event all lend to the <br/>
momentum of Alphabet Soup.  Read:  when the conference site goes <br/>
live, don&#39;t hesitate in registering ... I&#39;m already groaning at that <br/>
I know we&#39;ll be capping out attendance and will have to turn late-<br/>
comers away.  <br/>
<br/>
(You might ask:  then why didn&#39;t you pick a larger capacity venue, <br/>
Cindy?  &lt;G&gt;  Right?  Here&#39;s why:  there&#39;s a significant financial <br/>
risk inherent in deigning to take on the commitment of indpendantly <br/>
hosting a conference.  I&#39;ve already paid substantial sums out of <br/>
pocket to secure the venue contract, begin the generating of <br/>
conference-related collateral goods, etc.  Next year, I&#39;ll have a <br/>
better record of interest and attendance and from that will have a <br/>
more solid foundation on which to base decisions.  For this inaugral <br/>
year, I balanced my best guesses with my best budgeting forecasts and <br/>
my comfort with potential financial risk.  Register early, and you <br/>
won&#39;t have to worry yourself with potentially getting turned away.  <br/>
As it is, we&#39;ll have room for hundreds of you ... just not HUNDREDS.  <br/>
&lt;G&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for your interest!  We&#39;ll see you in September Anno!<br/>
<br/>
warmly,<br/>
<br/>
cindy<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2035369889">Ack!<br/>
<br/>
I *knew* I was forgetting something in this post this morning!  A <br/>
speaker I&#39;m so excited to be including in this inaugral event -- <br/>
Linda Clement, whose name you&#39;ll recognize if you&#39;re on Unschooling <br/>
Canada!  (Ack, sorry Linda if you&#39;re reading!  Dont&#39; take it <br/>
personally ... take it as a sign of my early morning scatterbrain!)  <br/>
Linda is a prolific writer and a compassionate parenting coach, <br/>
(www.raisingparents.net).  Her two daughters, 17 and 20, were always <br/>
unschooled, and are now happily unschooling their way through their <br/>
adulthoods.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I just got off a conference with my web guy, and, I&#39;m happy to <br/>
say, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.alphabetsoupconference.com">http://www.alphabetsoupconference.com</a> will go live tonight!  <br/>
Woohoo!  Not that there&#39;ll be any meaningful content on it yet ... <br/>
have to be another one, (design) two, (sitemapping) and three weeks <br/>
(e-commerce live) patient for that.  <br/>
