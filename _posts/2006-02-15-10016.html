<div id="ygrps-yiv-131480749">&quot;Thanks Ren, you are right, it is a schooling problem.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You know Sandy, I&#39;ve been thinking about it and I really phrased that<br/>
wrong.:)<br/>
It isn&#39;t just a school problem, but what I should have said is that<br/>
this list can&#39;t help people include school in their lives to solve<br/>
problems. What we CAN do, is offer up unschooling philsophy as the way<br/>
to help with various issues.<br/>
<br/>
In this case, I think the problem is more with how the parents view<br/>
the child&#39;s activities, than any problem with the child being demotivated.<br/>
<br/>
There was some really cool thing about phrasing stuff in<br/>
&quot;educationese&quot; somewhere. Let me poke around and see what I can find. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1101045392">Ren,  I knew what you meant, it was on my mind all<br/>
day.  I think the best thing for me to do is just<br/>
watch and learn for awhile, see what people are<br/>
posting and keep comments limited until I can go into<br/>
this how I want without worrying so much about DH.  <br/>
<br/>
I would truly appreciate the educationese though! <br/>
Thanks...I do want whats best for Zak.  ;-)  There is<br/>
so much to learn here, even if I don&#39;t ask questions<br/>
for now.  You all are great and have much wisdom to<br/>
offer, think I&#39;ll just drink in your all&#39;s thoughts<br/>
and advise, let sink into my soul.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re so kind.:)<br/>
And trust your own innate wisdom too....I think that&#39;s what causes us<br/>
to question and squirm inside when things aren&#39;t quite &quot;right&quot;. <br/>
You&#39;ve always been an inspiration to me with your very open heart and<br/>
mind. Your children are lucky to have such a sweet mum.<br/>
