<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;By the time I was 6 1/2 months pregnant with my twins, it was common for <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;people I met to comment &quot;Any day now, hmmm?&quot; I&#39;d either make a<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;noncommital noise if I wasn&#39;t in the mood for a discussion of twins, or<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;else I&#39;d say something like &quot;no, not for another 2 months or so. Twins!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I had the exact opposite problem.  This brought back the memory.  I was huge<br/>
people would guess I was pregnant in my first trimester.  By the time I was<br/>
6 mo. pregnant I looked 8-9 months.  People were always coming up to me<br/>
saying, &quot;Oh must be twins.&quot;  No, I was just huge!  Speaking of rude people<br/>
DH and I stopped at a buffet diner in a small town btwn Dallas and Houston.<br/>
I (an already abnormally beg eater though I&#39;ve never been bigger than a size<br/>
8) was loading my plate, when an elderly woman next to me says, &quot;You know<br/>
you&#39;re not really eating for two.&quot;  I thought DH was going to take her out.<br/>
So like others have said, no matter what the situation you&#39;re going to meet<br/>
rude disapproving people.  Just gotta keep your chin up.  I agree that if it<br/>
happens again it&#39;s important to let your ds know it was them not him.<br/>
