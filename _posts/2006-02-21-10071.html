<div id="ygrps-yiv-1156211058">Well we planned on being at home next year but Courtney wanted to finish this school year. Then I got a nasty note sent home about my child&#39;s 9 unexcused absences . <br/>
  After looking up MS laws and finding out they could force her to stay next year if she had more than 12 unexcused absences we decided our homeschool career would start now :) <br/>
   <br/>
  Courtney is sitting at the table doing a math workbook we have had around forever. I told her she didnt have to do it and she said she wants to anyway so I said ok just stop whenever you get tired of it. <br/>

  Thanks! Court is a little sad about missing her friends at school but we are going to still try to get together with some and I think as she makes new homeschooling friends she wont feel so &quot;lost&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I pulled my dd out in the middle of 4th grade, she kept most of her <br/>
friends from school until she made unschooling friends.  Now she is <br/>
not as interested in them because they complain all the time about <br/>
school, homework and the teachers.  Elizabeth said she was tired of <br/>
hearing it and she couldn&#39;t relate to them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-120301935">Its amazing how fast even kindergarteners become indoctrined into the &quot;assembly line of school &quot;<br/>
   <br/>
  This eve I asked Courtney if she wanted to go to Sam&#39;s club with me and mentioned that they had some computer games there and some neat books with different animal parts in them . Well we get there and she tells me we should get this paperdoll book because it can be for art. I explained to her that we could get it just because it is something she will enjoy. <br/>
  then a few minutes later she says mom are you going to give me tons of homework when I get in thrid grade? I had to laugh and told her baby Im never going to give you homework. <br/>
   <br/>
  This might sound harsh but it makes me think of the slaves and how many became indentured servants because they had no idea how to go off and live on their own after being told when to eat, when to pee etc etc all their lives. <br/>
