Well, first I would argue that he probably has no problems focussing on <br/>
something that interests him. He probably happily focusses for long, <br/>
long periods on video games or some other interest. So it&#39;s probably <br/>
just &quot;school-itis&quot; that he&#39;s suffering from. As soon as he&#39;s away from <br/>
that environment, my guess is that a lot of his &quot;symptoms&quot; will <br/>
disappear.<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind, too, that out of school, there&#39;s no one to &quot;be behind&quot; or <br/>
&quot;ahead&quot; of---he&#39;ll just *be* exactly where he IS.<br/>

<br/>
Well, you&#39;re assuming I would want it heavily monitored. I would not. I <br/>
trust my boys to enjoy the internet (and TV and radio and CDs and DVDs <br/>
and games and...) withOUT parental controls. They both share concerns <br/>
with me, and I think monitoring things kids frequent only shows a lack <br/>
of trust and respect on the part of the adults.<br/>
<br/>
We already have several networking sites---myspace and facebook are <br/>
already popular and active---as well as unschooling yahoogroups that <br/>
many kids frequent.<br/>
<br/>
So...I don&#39;t know that *this* is your target audience for such a site. <br/>
Maybe try the school-at-homers (doh!) or the other very conservative, <br/>
restrictive parenting elists.<br/>
<br/>
Google &quot;parental controls tweens&quot;---I bet you&#39;d have lots of hits. This <br/>
is one of the VERY few lists which doesn&#39;t condone &quot;heavily monitored&quot; <br/>
sites.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-857950180">I know I have said it before but my 16 yr old nephew did alot better <br/>
when he was taken out of school. He was still doing school through <br/>
the public system, but his teacher came to him. He really did better. <br/>
He got in less fights while at home due to it. So, I would say taking <br/>
a child out like that would help a ton. He had alot of issues (ADHD, <br/>
Bi-polar, family problems, and more). <br/>
<br/>
My son would easily be an ADHD label too. You should see him at <br/>
soccer. He doesn&#39;t want to play soccer for 1 hour and I don&#39;t blame <br/>
him. The coach is very nice and since he is just shy of 4, no one <br/>
expects much more. Right now he would rather run around like an <br/>
airplane, sit with me, etc. At this age no one minds much but I see <br/>
possible problems in the future. I don&#39;t want him forced into <br/>
anything. I consider his strong will and playfulness a good thing. <br/>
Those are things I want perserved. <br/>
<br/>
Kids like that/this are often VERY smart! It may not show up as <br/>
following directions or doing well on school tests, but I have <br/>
learned alot through kids like this. Great inspirations they are! <br/>
<br/>
As far as &quot;real&quot; ADHD I have seen real improvements when a child&#39;s <br/>
diet and supplements (fish/flax oil) are monitored/adjusted- mostly <br/>
by offering healthier items. I have even seen changes in my own son. <br/>
He loves cod liver oil and when I remember to offer it to him, he is <br/>
calmer, though his calm might be someone else&#39;s wild :) He even asks <br/>
for other supplements that studies show kids like that might need and <br/>
he chews them in his mouth! I have never forced any of them on him. I <br/>
still am amazed.<br/>
<br/>
But I am still quilty of wishing he was less crazy :) but only <br/>
because I haven&#39;t learned how to deal with the rest of the world. I <br/>
know if I lived alone with him I wouldn&#39;t know what normal was. I <br/>
would have nothing to compare him to so it is my thinking that needs <br/>
to change, not him.</div>

It might be helpful if we knew a bit more of how much &quot;influence&quot; is<br/>
involved here - are you his guardian? Are his parents willing to<br/>
consider homeschooling (if you&#39;re not his guardian)? If they both work,<br/>
are you able to help them with the child care issues that arise from not<br/>
using the government childcare facility known as school? Any/all of<br/>
these scenarios CAN work out (unless his parents aren&#39;t willing to<br/>
consider homeschooling at all).<br/>
<br/>
I believe that had we enrolled DS in school, he would&#39;ve been diagnosed<br/>
and medicated pretty quickly - he thinks best when he&#39;s bouncing around<br/>
the room and recently said that while he can read just fine, he doesn&#39;t<br/>
like to because it&#39;s just sitting still looking at letters on the page.<br/>
He&#39;s 110% energy all the time (he&#39;s even an &#39;energetic&#39; sleeper and I&#39;ve<br/>
had the bruises to prove it lol). At the same time, he can focus<br/>
intently on designing StarCraft maps in detail for hours. He&#39;s even<br/>
figured out how to do things in the map editor (both in StarCraft and<br/>
the non-online Warcraft games) that DH, a veteran gamer, didn&#39;t know.<br/>
Being free is his best option.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1760081204"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;You should see him at soccer. He doesn&#39;t want to play soccer for 1 hour<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and I don&#39;t blame him<br/>
DS was interested in soccer at around 6 years old. The town had a one<br/>
week soccer camp program, 2 hrs per day, that looked like a good fit. DS<br/>
LOVED IT! The next year, he made sure I signed him up as soon as<br/>
possible for the camp. However, the age bracket was different - 7 yr<br/>
olds were grouped with the 8-9 yr olds (the 6 yr olds were with the 4<br/>
and 5s). And, they went for 3 hours instead of two. Plus, rather than it<br/>
being mostly short fun ball-related games (with lots of breaks and jokes<br/>
and silly stuff), it was heavier on skill drills and actual &#39;soccer&#39;<br/>
practice. DS tried it for a day and decided he really didn&#39;t like it. We<br/>
asked that he go back for the next day to see if it changed (first days<br/>
can sometimes be rather stressful in general, getting organized and<br/>
all). He decided that day that he didn&#39;t like the organized stuff BUT he<br/>
hit it off with another kid who also didn&#39;t want to do the drill stuff.<br/>
So, the two of them would meet up each morning and take their soccer<br/>
balls (each participant got their own ball as part of the program) and<br/>
go find a spot off to the side to run and play. He liked doing that and<br/>
gladly got up each morning to go play with a new friend. [parenthetical<br/>
note: that second year, we were asked to house one of the coaches - the<br/>
&#39;import&#39; coaches from the UK and they travel around the US all summer<br/>
running these camps. We got the cost of the program refunded for<br/>
providing a bed, shower, and some meals - plus we got a chance to meet<br/>
someone from Wales!] The following year he was uninterested so we didn&#39;t<br/>
sign up. Last summer, we signed up for a beginning golf lesson program,<br/>
once per week for 4 weeks. He loved it! It was maybe 5-15 minutes of<br/>
instruction on the various clubs (how to hold a driver, lining up the<br/>
ball, swing and follow through, etc) with the other 45 minutes of the<br/>
class time on the driving range hitting golfballs while the instructor<br/>
walked around providing tips and encouragement. We&#39;ve already signed up<br/>
for that one again.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It always sounds like a good thing to get unschooling kids together.  <br/>
Their moms have found a common connection because of unschooling, so  <br/>
why shouldn&#39;t they?<br/>
<br/>
But the reason the moms get along is because unschooling is a common  <br/>
interest. For unschooling kids, unschooling is a life style, not an  <br/>
interest.<br/>
<br/>
Same goes with ages. Age is not an interest ;-) Just because kids are  <br/>
between 6 and 12 doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;ll have anything in common.<br/>
<br/>
What kids want, just as adults want, are to find people with  <br/>
compatible personalities and similar interests. (Too simplified but a  <br/>
good starting point for people trying to find friends for their kids.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I saw my eleven year-old<br/>
&gt; niece&#39;s MySpace page and I almost had a stroke!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is her MySpace page stroke worthy because she&#39;s unmonitored, because  <br/>
she&#39;s 11 or because she&#39;s in school and disconnected from her family?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s an important question! One that often isn&#39;t asked because almost  <br/>
all kids go to school with their lives controlled by school and  <br/>
parents. So there isn&#39;t a way to separate the effects of school (and  <br/>
traditional parenting) from the effects of being 11.<br/>
<br/>
But unschoolers know. :-) We can see why traditionally parented,  <br/>
schooled kids hide things, why those kids pretend to be something  <br/>
they aren&#39;t to attract &quot;friends&quot;. Take away the distrust, take away  <br/>
the pressure to do what they don&#39;t believe in, take away the severing  <br/>
of family ties while they&#39;re still dependent, add in trust that  <br/>
they&#39;re good people, add in support for their interests and who they  <br/>
are, add in close family ties and it&#39;s amazing the behavior that&#39;s  <br/>
considered normal for kids really isn&#39;t. So much is caused by  <br/>
distrust, control and disconnection.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What would you like<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When parents start monitoring their kids lives, it&#39;s with the intent  <br/>
to keep the scary world away from their kids. Parents are saying &quot;I  <br/>
don&#39;t trust the world.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What kids *feel* is &quot;I don&#39;t trust you.&quot; Kids will react to the  <br/>
reality they perceive not to the one we intend. So it makes no  <br/>
difference how good our intentions are, makes no difference what we  <br/>
tell them our intentions are, if the actions feel like distrust and  <br/>
control, kids will react like we&#39;re intentionally distrusting and  <br/>
controlling them.<br/>
<br/>
Kids who are controlled (by distrust in this case) learn to hide  <br/>
things they know their parents would disapprove of. We can&#39;t help  <br/>
them and advise them and pass on useful information for situations if  <br/>
kids are hiding things. And if we treat them in ways that will cause  <br/>
them to hide things, then we&#39;re getting in the way of our own goal.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean we throw our hands up in the air! Just because the  <br/>
familiar tools of keeping kids safe aren&#39;t as good as we thought,  <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t *other* tools.<br/>
<br/>
We trust *them*. We trust that they want to be good people, that they  <br/>
want to be safe. They don&#39;t always know how but we trust that they  <br/>
have instincts and that when they feel something is wrong -- *and*  <br/>
we&#39;ve shown that we&#39;re trustworthy to *help* them -- they&#39;ll come to  <br/>
us for advice. And unlike schooled kids, we&#39;re sharing life together  <br/>
so we understand what they&#39;re involved with enough to help them when  <br/>
they ask questions.<br/>
<br/>
It does work :-)<br/>
