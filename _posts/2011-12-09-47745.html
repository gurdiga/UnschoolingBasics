I don&#39;t have a Mac so this is a general suggestion rather than specific. There are programs, such as &quot;Microsoft Works&quot; with templates for business cards, calendars, brochures... that sort of thing which would likely be what she wants or close to it. I&#39;ve built little home-made booklets with them and they do allow you to import your own photos and artwork as well as create your own text and even design things from scratch.<br/>
<br/>
 A quick google turns up a program called &quot;iWork&quot; for Mac which looks nice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1980392160">Blurb &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.blurb.com/">http://www.blurb.com/</a>&gt; sounds like something that may fit the bill<br/>
(I, however, never used it). Have a look in the samples section.<br/>
<br/>
If printing the final product is not an important requirement then I guess<br/>
a standard blogging platform is sufficient. Such as<br/>
Blogger&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.blogger.com/">http://www.blogger.com/</a>&gt;,<br/>
or TypePad &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.typepad.com/">http://www.typepad.com/</a>&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2005001349">I&#39;m not sure if this will fit the bill for what you&#39;re looking for (it&#39;s not designed for kids, necessarily) but I have had great luck writing and self-publishing children&#39;s books for my kids using Lulu.com.  I take photos that fit the story, do the writing, and then, using the &quot;photo book&quot; feature--combine them into a book.  The templates are fairly flexible, ease of us is pretty good (I&#39;m not patient with technology), and the price is good, too.  I&#39;m sure there are a lot of other sites that do what Lulu does....this is just what I&#39;ve used.  <br/>
<br/>
To give another option----my 10 year old loves to write and draw.  I buy bare books (I think you can google these to find where to purchase...I purchase them at our university bookstore for about $4) and let her write and illustrate.  If she wants to make copies (for Christmas gifts, for ie) we color copy onto cardstock and have them bound.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps---<br/>
Sarah<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1386746666">Story Book Weaver deluxe program for the pc, be sure it works on your system before purchasing. It is an older program but my 11 year old really likes it and uses it beacuse it&#39;s fun! It&#39;s around 6-20 dollars on Ebay or Amazon. Hope this helps. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>As a beginning until you find something better maybe, there&#39;s Story Jumper online. It&#39;s free. The books are stored at the website and you can&#39;t print. (Though you could probably do screen captures.) It has premade characters and backgrounds to choose from. But it allows the upload of photos which obviously can be her own drawings.<br/>

Kid Pix Deluxe 3D looks very cool! They seem to be animated story books and again not printed. There&#39;s a gallery of kid creations that are pretty impressive :-)<br/>

That&#39;s very odd. There should be more but kids&#39; software seems to have dried up. And there doesn&#39;t seem to be easy software that does both drawing and writing. Photoshop Elements will combine both, but you&#39;ll need to be aware of page size and doing more than one page at a time is tricky.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1168595103">Linnaea uses Autodesk Sketchbook Pro. I don&#39;t know how much writing capacity it has. I could check. Well, it has good sketching applications and it has an easily movable text layer. You can get a trial at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/pc/index?id=6848332&siteID=123112.">http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/pc/index?id=6848332&siteID=123112.</a> It would be a page by page application, though, and not one that let you do a book easily. I assume. Although it does have storyboard features. <br/>
