<div id="ygrps-yiv-745159532">I know what you mean...I have 2 sons previously dx&#39;d with Aspergers (1 also w/SID, ADHD/ODD).  I can see how the socks would be helpful for Autism and some sensory disorders, but I still wouldn&#39;t cover anyone&#39;s head (if that&#39;s how they&#39;re using them..it looks like that in some of the pictures, but maybe I&#39;m wrong).  I don&#39;t know if they&#39;d be helpful for my son during meltdowns.  Maybe for some kids, but I think it might make the natural human survival instincts come out and cause panic if it&#39;s used as a discipline or calming down tool.  As a side note, my oldest son no longer has Aspergers symptoms since we changed his diet....my 5 yr old is still a work in progress;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2067209478">I&#39;m curious........what diet changes did you make?  We are in the process of changing Mariah&#39;s diet too, to see what effects it has on behavior and symptoms.  But in my daughter&#39;s case she is in the process of being diagnosed with Bipolar/Asperger&#39;s/SPD/OCD/Dygraphia and Anxiety Disorder.  So it&#39;s real important for us to see if diet is a factor in any of the above.  She was previously diagnosed with ADHD/ODD but that diagnoses just does not fit.  <br/>
