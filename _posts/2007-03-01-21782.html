 </span></blockquote>....it lacked .... any indication that she ever struggled with doubts.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My doubts come from my own personal insecurities not from doubts about <br/>
unschooling.  When i consider my fears it makes me more assured that <br/>
unschooling is the right way to go.  It doesn&#39;t mean i am a perfect parent <br/>
all the time.  Facing my doubts head on ultimately builds strength in my <br/>
convictions.  (see below copy of my posting about doubts from regional <br/>
unschooling list).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve found that when I turn to people for advice who seem to always be 100% <br/>
confident, on the one hand I appreciate their advice but on the other I <br/>
begin to wonder if they just have such easy children that whatever they did <br/>
always &quot;worked&quot;.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know if my kids are easy but it has always worked!!!!  We have <br/>
unschooled right from the beginning so maybe that&#39;s why our relationships <br/>
are what they are - maybe not - your right i wouldn&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
There are, however, different challenges we&#39;ve faced with each child...or <br/>
rather each child in their own way has challenged us to be different or (as <br/>
Merideth so aptly put it) be better people.<br/>
<br/>
Funny how when my oldest dd was young, family and friends had very strong <br/>
feelings about how i responded to her.  They seemed to think of her as a <br/>
challenge and that i was not in control.  For me control wasn&#39;t my intention <br/>
- though they still don&#39;t necessarily understand this perspective.<br/>
<br/>
It appeared to others that she was the challenge...i had a very different <br/>
perception then of her and the situation and now that she&#39;s 13.5 the same <br/>
folks seem to have an entirely different perception of her as well and for <br/>
the most part a different regard for how i parent.  They don&#39;t voice out <br/>
loud the same concerns in my response to my very active and busy 8 yo.  <br/>
However, new concerns about how i am doing things are being voiced...as my <br/>
13.5 yo still doesn&#39;t do what other kids in school her age are doing.  <br/>
Comparing my kids &#39;academic&#39; learning to schooled kids doesn&#39;t work - just <br/>
as comparing their socialization skills and other personality traits to my <br/>
kids wouldn&#39;t hold muster either (imho).<br/>
<br/>
so what is &#39;working&#39; anyway.  i am always amazed by the kids who have been <br/>
labeled &#39;difficult&#39; as being extrodinary in their enthusiasm, energy, <br/>
creativity, etc.etcl.etc...of course now i&#39;m generalizing as well &lt;g&gt;.  but <br/>
i love being with these &#39;difficult&#39; kids..they keep me humble and alive and <br/>
conscious of the miracles of uniqueness in each individual.<br/>

my posting from another unschooling list.:<br/>
<br/>
Having doubts can be a good thing as it makes us question ourselves and<br/>
reevaluate our choices. Just so you know your human, even veteran seemingly<br/>
secure unschoolers can sometimes have doubts.<br/>
<br/>
My doubts often come from comparing myself to others. However, when i <br/>
question<br/>
if i am doing right by kids, i look at them and ask myself - are they happy?<br/>
are they secure? are they thriving? what do i need to be doing differently <br/>
to<br/>
facilitate them better? The answer has never been to put them in school. And<br/>
it&#39;s never to impose anything on them that they do not ask for.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes they see others doing something and wonder if it would work for <br/>
them.<br/>
We discuss it. We may try it. But often if they are insecure and doubting <br/>
what<br/>
we are doing in relation to others its time for a discussion about <br/>
differences<br/>
between people and making our own choices and why we are doing what we are<br/>
doing. i think its important for the kids to understand why they are <br/>
parented<br/>
the way they are and to get their feedback. And it may also be time to <br/>
surround<br/>
them (and myself) with like minded folks so i/we don&#39;t feel so weird - as in<br/>
truth we are so very different than the norm that being involved in the real<br/>
world we are confronted with our differences constantly.<br/>
<br/>
(We just came back from a three day road trip...stopping in CT for a <br/>
gathering<br/>
of unschoolers on the way to staying over night with unschooling friends in <br/>
MA<br/>
for two days).<br/>
<br/>
What exactly are you having doubts about? If you don&#39;t mind, it would be<br/>
helpful to share your concerns so that we can respond specifically. I have a<br/>
13yo and 8yo (both girls) and they have always unschooled and always learned <br/>
in<br/>
their own way at their own pace (it is very different than what we are<br/>
conditioned to believe as what&#39;s supposed to be or look like).<br/>

I love how you put this. Beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
I was talking to my sister last night (who also has an extremely<br/>
intense child) and we were commenting on how these particular children<br/>
have really caused us to become BETTER human beings. In so many ways,<br/>
Jalen has helped me grow....it&#39;s not exactly pain-free though.:)<br/>
