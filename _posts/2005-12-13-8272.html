Sharon, <br/>
 <br/>
You and your neice have different goals. This is SOOO common at this young age: you&#39;re just going to <br/>
have to grin and bear it for a few years. <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;d recommend starting now with practicing that hand wave---like, &quot;Oh, that&#39;s nothing&quot;---then turn, with <br/>
your nose in the air, and say, &quot;The proof is in the pudding, and I&#39;m a patient cook.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
And just leave it at that. Walk away. Say no more!<br/>
 <br/>
I did that for five years---and now MY kids are the stars! Because high school SUCKS! Suddenly our lives<br/>
don&#39;t look so lame! &lt;bwg&gt; My kids can look the adults in the eyes and carry on conversations. They have <br/>
passions they are immersed in. They&#39;re confident. They&#39;re interesting. They CARE! <br/>
 <br/>
And they LIKE their parents! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I refuse to go to the Lovejoy Christmas gathering any more---just not worth it. But Ben said that the <br/>
change was palpable! &lt;g&gt; At nine and 17, our boys were the ones everyone was impressed with. (And <br/>
unschooling isn&#39;t looking so freaky anymore! &lt;bwg&gt;)<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t give a crap about the family&#39;s late-coming accolades, but I can look back and know I did <br/>
the right thing. My children are happy and engaged and engaging. Their cousins are sullen and full of hate <br/>
and self-doubt.<br/>
 <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t chnage a thing---except that I wish that I&#39;d found unshcooling earlier!<br/>
Proof is in the pudding. Be patient. You&#39;ll enjoy the future gatherings a LOT more! &lt;G&gt; I promise!<br/>

I have to deal with hearing about my family members kids achievements, too. <br/>
And their achievements are great!  So I try to focus on the positive  and be<br/>
happy for them.  <br/>
 <br/>
I usually just don&#39;t say anything if a comment is made that I don&#39;t feel I<br/>
have to respond to.  My family can&#39;t &quot;bait&quot; me if I don&#39;t let them.  And the<br/>
fact that I&#39;m unschooling... well, I&#39;m going to keep that to myself.<br/>

I agree with what Kelly said except that you might be able to head off  some <br/>

Maybe choose something *else* to gush over that you truly like  about her.  So <br/>

animals&quot; or whatever works.  Everybody will pick  up on your frustration and <br/>
assume it is jealousy.....so be exactly how you  would like them to be if it <br/>
were your child that was in the limelight.<br/>
 <br/>
I decided this year not to talk about my kids&#39; achievements unless  asked.  <br/>
Honestly, everyone was so interested in all the other perfect  kids that no one <br/>
really bothered too much.  I had a few standard answers  up my sleeve but <br/>
like Kelly said, it was obvious that my kids are growing and  learning and kind.  <br/>
Nothing much was said.<br/>

Suffice it to say that my family doesn&#39;t understand homeschooling, <br/>

<br/>
It must be hard to not have your extended family be supportive of <br/>
what you&#39;re doing. Not everybody understands <br/>
homeschooling/unschooling. My advice is to not get sucked into a <br/>
conversation. Have some answers ready for their questions, practice <br/>
them before you go. Keep your answers short and postive and then <br/>
excuse yourself and walk away.  <br/>
<br/>
Are you the type of person who worries/cares what others think? If <br/>
you are, it may be a little harder to handle this. <br/>
(I&#39;ve never been one to wonder or concern myself with what other <br/>
people think of my decisions so my extended family has had a <br/>
lifetime of knowing I don&#39;t care what they think! LOL!!)<br/>
<br/>
One thing that I found helps me when people start to &quot;question&quot; me <br/>
(not to be confused with someone who really wants to know because <br/>
they&#39;re interested) is approach their question as if they&#39;re asking <br/>
about their kids, not mine. Such as:<br/>
Nosey person #1: You homeschool your children? What about <br/>
socialization?<br/>
Me: You think you&#39;d have a hard time socializing your children <br/>
without school? That&#39;s a shame, I have no problem with it. <br/>
Nosey person #2: You don&#39;t use a curriculim (sp?)? How do you know <br/>
what to teach them? <br/>
Me? So if you homeschooled your children you would need a pre-<br/>
packaged curriculim to teach your children? I&#39;ve never had a need <br/>
for one. <br/>
You get the idea. It works for me! <br/>
Good luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2031456101">I would also try to find a way to be happy for them. If that it is<br/>
what they are into then it would be great to be able say, &quot;good for<br/>
her! She must be so happy!&quot; Lets face it - if your children were into<br/>
spelling or ballet, I am sure they would be given the same<br/>
opportunities to explore those passions - actually even more because<br/>
they would not have to fit it in around a school schedule. If you are<br/>
happy in your heart with what you have chosen - then you should be<br/>
able to feel good towards your niece without feeling negative towards<br/>
your kids. Just think &quot;different strokes!&quot; Easier said than done, I<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-202337833">I agree with the idea of &quot;go with it&quot; - when everyone is saying how <br/>
wonderful this girl is, agree with them yes she is wonderful and such <br/>
a good cook (or pet sitter or gardener or whatever) too!  Maybe even <br/>
toss in something like &quot;She must take after Great-grandmother <br/>
Sarahbeth who was in the Ziegfield Follies&quot; or &quot;She takes after Uncle <br/>
Boris who wrote the dictionary&quot; or whatever. While they&#39;re busy <br/>
gushing, they won&#39;t be pestering.<br/>
<br/>
If they do get to pestering, I&#39;ve found the simple word &quot;Why?&quot; very <br/>
helpful (in those few occasions - most of our extended family keeps <br/>
their noses out of our business). &quot;They need to be in school for <br/>
proper socialization&quot; Why? &quot;You need to use a curriculum&quot; Why? And <br/>
here&#39;s one I got from my 80some year old aunt several years ago &quot;He <br/>
has to go to school so he can learn to read&quot; Why? (which led to quite <br/>
a wonderful conversation and she&#39;s now one of our biggest supporters, <br/>
wishes she could have hsed her youngest child lo these many years ago).<br/>
<br/>
Then of course there&#39;s the bean dip defense &quot;We&#39;re doing fine thanks. <br/>
pass the bean dip. Oh yes it is wonderful about greatniece. We&#39;re <br/>
doing fine thanks. please pass the bean dip.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As someone said somewhere (so many boards, so little time lol) <br/>
approach it the same way you would if someone questioned how many <br/>
children you have, your choice to breastfeed, your choice of <br/>
spouse/partner, etc. It is a *choice* that they have little to no say <br/>
in. Oh, and keep in mind that for the most part (except maybe odd <br/>
Uncle Ernie) they really do have your children&#39;s interests at heart <br/>
and love them and want the best for them - they just haven&#39;t yet seen <br/>
that there are equally valid alternatives to the standard paradigm.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been said before but I&#39;ll say it again The proof of the pudding <br/>
is in the eating<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1180150009">Something important to remember is that even if your kids were in school,<br/>
they may not be winning spelling bees or performing the Nutcracker. I went<br/>
through school, I did pretty good, but I was never outstanding at anything.<br/>
I was just an average kid. As are most of the kids. Sometimes we look at<br/>
these kids who do exceptional things and we think it&#39;s because they&#39;re not<br/>
being homeschooled that they have that opportunity. In my area, where there<br/>
are a lot of homeschoolers of all kinds as well as private schools and the<br/>
usual assortment of public schools, you can find kids who are doing amazing<br/>
things from any of the  groups.  But they are the exception, always. Not the<br/>
norm.  People like to point out these kinds of kids and make a big deal out<br/>
of them and ignore all the average kids who are learning and growing in<br/>
equally amazing but less flashy ways.  What I want for my kids is for them<br/>
to be happy, content and able to support themselves as adults.  If they need<br/>
to win spelling bees to do this, I&#39;ll help them all the way, but in reality,<br/>
it will mean excepting who they are and where they are at any given time. My<br/>
oldest &quot;looks good&quot; to outsiders. She writes and directs plays. She directed<br/>
our local Homeschool play this fall and did a fabulous job. It&#39;s who she is<br/>
and what she would do in or out of school (actually, I think she has more<br/>
opportunities by not being in school).  My other daughter is very good at<br/>
people skills. She has lots of friends, lives to hang out with her friends<br/>
and is currently in the process of analyzing her friends to do psych<br/>
profiles of them. But it&#39;s not flashy and public and no one (except her<br/>
friends) are really aware of what she does. Neither is more or less<br/>
important. Both are right where they need to be right now.  Be happy where<br/>
your child is right now and it&#39;s easier to enjoy the spotlight of someone<br/>
else&#39;s child. And quite honestly, there is something to be said for not<br/>
being in the spotlight. Those expectations can be very heavy after a while<br/>
and mistakes are glaring.  Being average and unobtrusive can have a lot of<br/>
advantages!! :-)<br/>

I would also try to find a way to be happy for them. If that it is<br/>
what they are into then it would be great to be able say, &quot;good for<br/>
her! She must be so happy!&quot; Lets face it - if your children were into<br/>
spelling or ballet, I am sure they would be given the same<br/>
opportunities to explore those passions - actually even more because<br/>
they would not have to fit it in around a school schedule. If you are<br/>
happy in your heart with what you have chosen - then you should be<br/>
able to feel good towards your niece without feeling negative towards<br/>
your kids. Just think &quot;different strokes!&quot; Easier said than done, I<br/>
know!<br/>

&gt; I agree with what Kelly said except that you might be able to head off<br/>
some<br/>

&gt; Maybe choose something *else* to gush over that you truly like  about her.<br/>
So<br/>
&gt; when everyone is saying &quot;smartest kid ever&quot; you can say  &quot;and she is so<br/>
kind to<br/>
&gt; animals&quot; or whatever works.  Everybody will pick  up on your frustration<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; assume it is jealousy.....so be exactly how you  would like them to be if<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; were your child that was in the limelight.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I decided this year not to talk about my kids&#39; achievements unless  asked.<br/>
&gt; Honestly, everyone was so interested in all the other perfect  kids that<br/>
no one<br/>
&gt; really bothered too much.  I had a few standard answers  up my sleeve but<br/>
&gt; like Kelly said, it was obvious that my kids are growing and  learning and<br/>
kind.<br/>
&gt; Nothing much was said.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Have fun!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-121736179">Another thing to remember is that an award or something in a school <br/>
may not mean very much!<br/>
<br/>
Just for one example ... a few years ago my in-laws were so proud of <br/>
my neice (their granddaughter) because she got a letter from her <br/>
English teacher when she was a freshman in high school, saying that <br/>
she had an A average and was doing very well. It was obviously a <br/>
form letter. They hung a copy of the letter on the refrigerator and <br/>
brought it up several times. <br/>
<br/>
I asked my neice about what they were doing in the class, and she <br/>
said, &quot;It&#39;s so boring. All we do are worksheets.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well, what books have you been reading in the class?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;None.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Have you been writing essays or stories or anything?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No, we don&#39;t write anything. We just do worksheets.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, I was not very impressed! <br/>

&gt; I had to laugh at the proof is in the pudding<br/>

&quot;I know. I worry so much about her - you know how overprogrammed kids  <br/>
are these days and how they end up burned out by the time they&#39;re in  <br/>
high school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But, better to bide your time, be patient, remind yourself that your  <br/>
goals are different and be sweet and positive about her accomplishments.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t be. Acknowledge them and let them float on by. Take a deep breath and remember how truly amazing your own kids are right now in this moment. That&#39;s the feeling to hold onto.<br/>
<br/>
I get a weird feeling every year when the holiday letters start coming in. Parents and grandparents are so proud of  &quot;accomplishments.&quot; It&#39;s hard to read about all those good grades, soccer trophies, college scholarships, etc. When I start my own holiday letter I always have to stop and think about what I want to share about my own kids. I try hard not to include the &quot;gold stars&quot; but rather something to show Who They Are and what they are into right now. For Conor this year it remains his passion for anything Japanese and anime. For Casey it&#39;s Neopets. That&#39;s what I told the relatives about. :o)<br/>

&quot;Just today I&#39;m going to be utterly present for my children, I&#39;m going to be in their world (not just doing my own thing while they do theirs), I&#39;m going to really hear them, I&#39;m going to prepare myself to be present starting right now.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2010949515">I can empathize with what you are feeling with your neice, the &#39;wonder<br/>
child&#39;.  I, too, have a similar situation.  Mine happens to be with my<br/>
sister, who I am quite close to.  I have 3 sons, 6, 4, 1.  She has 1 baby,<br/>
jus turned 1 (a girl, to boot!)  She also has 2 step-children, boy 7, girl<br/>
11.  Just this summer, we were walking through Sears with our babies, and<br/>
she starts telling me how worried she is about my ds (6yo) because he<br/>
doesn&#39;t know how to read yet, and what if he has to go to school someday,<br/>
and &quot;i just feel so bad for him and i&#39;m so worried about him and yada yada<br/>
yada&quot;.  My ds had just gone to her ds birthday party at Chucky Cheeses, and<br/>
evidently she was SO CONCERNED also about his social skills because he<br/>
didn&#39;t go out and dance with &#39;all the other kids and Chucky&#39;  Well, he<br/>
didn&#39;t know ANYBODY else there, except the birthday boy, so he and my 4yo<br/>
felt best just staying by my mom&#39;s side.  HOW HORRIBLE, huh?<br/>
Also, her ds is a reader (of course), so I KNOW KNOW KNOW she is doing the<br/>
&#39;comparison game&#39;.  I pretty much just told her right then and there that I<br/>
will not tolerate my children being compared, judged, etc against someone<br/>
elses standards, and if I feel like that is happening, we will not be<br/>
spending time with people who choose to do so.<br/>
The BEST part of this whole story, is while she was chewing my ear off about<br/>
how worried she was about my poor, unschooled, sad, illiterate, socially<br/>
retarded children, they were out with their father riding down a local river<br/>
in a canoe, stopping on every island they found, naming those islands<br/>
accordingly (goose poop island, etc!).  They found a nest of turtle eggs,<br/>
saw gobs of turtles and other wildlife, and MOST importantly, were creating<br/>
unforgettable memories with their father.<br/>
She (my sister) works full time, so does her husband.  THey have the step<br/>
children 3 days a week.  I&#39;ve seen the interaction between their father and<br/>
them, far from warm and fuzzy.  They better do it and do it RIGHT (by his<br/>
standards), or they&#39;ll be pushed and pressured until they do.  Interestingly<br/>
enough, the 11 yo recently came home with a couple of d&#39;s and f&#39;s on her<br/>
report card.  So, naturally got her tv taken away, no phone privelages, etc.<br/>
etc.  <br/>
<br/>
Hmmmmm, public school/unschool?<br/>
Doesn&#39;t take a genius to figure that one out!!!  :)<br/>
<br/>
Namaste~<br/>
