<br/>
 Understood---and easily! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  No! I get crabby and hot (I live in Columbia, SC! &lt;g&gt;). I don&#39;t always <br/>
get enough sleep. I forget to eat.<br/>
<br/>
 But it gets better and easier every day.<br/>
<br/>
  There&#39;s a lot of tongue-biting and deep-breathing and thinking before <br/>
reacting. But it&#39;s amazing how much better you get at things when you <br/>
think about them and DO them!<br/>
<br/>
  My goal is to be a better parent. Not better than other parents. Not <br/>
better than my parents---although that&#39;s certainly possible. But to be <br/>
better than I was. To be a *better* parent. I know I can always get <br/>
better.<br/>
<br/>
  Some people will stop at becoming even remotely better than their own <br/>
parents were. I know lots of those! Or better than the neighbors are to <br/>
their children. But I know *I* can be better than I am *now*---so I <br/>
work towards that goal.<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t spank any more (that stopped when Cameron five, I think). I <br/>
hardly ever yell---and I&#39;m a yeller. I *do* get frustrated and <br/>
irrational sometimes. But the more aware and mindful you are, the more <br/>
aware and mindful you are! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Your children will be older every day---every minute. And if you can <br/>
stop---just a *second*---before speaking or reacting, you *will* become <br/>
more like the parent you&#39;d like to be---the parent you wish you&#39;d had!<br/>
<br/>
 You can do it! Patience! Breathe!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-762166255">well, I understand your question. Alas, I am not evolved enough (or  <br/>
liberated enough) yet. I am getting better daily, because there is a  <br/>
series of things you can do to get better. The first step is  <br/>
realizing it is a problem ;-) Which you have done, me too. Then I  <br/>
moved to apologizing to my children, rather than trying to justify my  <br/>
reactions. Now I am happy to say that after months of doing that, we  <br/>
are finally starting to see me come to the place where at least half  <br/>
of my poor reactions have disappeared. I still have bad days, and  <br/>
sometimes still become harsh, but I more often say &quot;Guys, I&#39;m really  <br/>
starting to lose my temper, and I need some time to relax!&quot; Or even  <br/>
just &quot;I AM SO MAD RIGHT NOW!&quot; Which I think is healthy for them to  <br/>
know, the important thing for OUR family is letting them know that  <br/>
they did not do anything wrong, I just don&#39;t have the tools yet. The  <br/>
cool thing is that they all know that *I&#39;m* learning too, and I&#39;m  <br/>
open to suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
Having seen all these great changes, I am confident that sooner  <br/>
(rather than later) I will be mostly gentle mom. But everyone does  <br/>
have bad days, and I think it&#39;s important to model how to react  <br/>
appropriately, and model letting your needs be known. I know other  <br/>
moms will have much wisdom here, I am new to this also, maybe eight  <br/>
months, even though I&#39;ve always tried to be an attached parent and  <br/>
attending to needs, not always the mindful parent that is discussed  <br/>
here.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you really succeed in putting this philosophy into practice day<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Quick answer is no! :-)<br/>
<br/>
The goal is to do better. The goal is to be more mindful and make  <br/>
better choices.<br/>
<br/>
But we all make mistakes. We all get too tired and say and do things  <br/>
we shouldn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Pam has a good way of expressing it: Always give yourself two  <br/>
choices. And then choose the better one.<br/>
<br/>
But of course we&#39;ll sometimes even fail at giving ourselves two  <br/>
choices. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
But the goal is to focus on doing better. The list is to help us  <br/>
focus on what better looks like so we know where we&#39;re headed and  <br/>
why :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Some of their reactions can make me quite crazy, in a<br/>
&gt; completely irrational way.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That often comes from a need to control. Part of mindful parenting is  <br/>
letting go of control and being their partner.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have a recent problem you&#39;d like to post. It&#39;s often more  <br/>
helpful to see the new thinking applied to a specific problem rather  <br/>
than just talking about the theory! :-)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not always, no. We should expect to fail sometimes but we should see  <br/>
that there were better choices we could have made -- even if we  <br/>
couldn&#39;t see them at the time.<br/>
<br/>
People too often feel that if they can&#39;t be perfect then they&#39;re bad.  <br/>
It&#39;s more helpful to *know* we aren&#39;t perfect and that the goal is  <br/>
always to try to do better.<br/>

 Your children will be older every day---every minute. And if you can<br/>

become<br/>

<br/>
 Responding to my own post...<br/>
<br/>
  By being the best mom I can be today and trying to be a better mom <br/>
tomorrow, I am modeling working at being a better parent. Doing *just* <br/>
that is a good goal, but an even better goal is having children who <br/>
will be better parents than I could ever be. They will start with less <br/>
baggage than I had---fewer bitten tongues and shallower breaths! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I *know* this because I already see it. Cameron, at 18, is better <br/>
already than I was just a few years ago. He has a better center of <br/>
emotional balance. He&#39;s much further evolved/enlightened! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 My lucky, lucky grandchildren! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
I have normal ups and downs of emotion - I get angry, I get sad, I  <br/>
get stressed and my usual reaction to all of those tends to be  <br/>
impatience.<br/>
<br/>
But, I&#39;m past the point of reverting to any conventional parenting  <br/>
methods. It helps that I didn&#39;t have a lot of parent-voices in my  <br/>
head - my mom, especially, was not very conventional, herself. I was  <br/>
never spanked and &quot;punishment&quot; was, &quot;Go in your room until you feel  <br/>
in control of yourself, please.&quot; Not too bad for the 1950&#39;s &lt;G&gt;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1703372866">Thank you for your answers :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad to read that the *good* reaction will become more and more <br/>
natural and that eventually I&#39;ll might stop being unfair and mean <br/>
with my children. It&#39;s a process, all right. <br/>
<br/>
Actually, I&#39;m working on it for years now, but it seems so natural <br/>
for you and so connected with a whole philosophy of life ... <br/>
<br/>
My problem is that, when the pressure is high inside me (and it can <br/>
be for very small things), I act in complete opposition with what I <br/>
believe is true and good (well, I guess that you already understood <br/>
this part).<br/>
<br/>
Concrete examples ?<br/>
<br/>
For instance, we are expected somewhere (school for instance, as ds <br/>
isn&#39;t unschooled yet, or doctor, or dinner at my parents) and we get <br/>
late. Shouldn&#39;t be a big issue, but for me, it actually becomes one, <br/>
I don&#39;t know why. So I can deal with that very calmly (good days) or <br/>
I can explode and yell on everybody (bad days).<br/>
<br/>
Another example : my son can cry in a way that makes me crazy. I <br/>
KNOW I shoudln&#39;t, but I can be sarcastic about it (sorry I can&#39;t <br/>
translate what I tell him, but I minimize the reasons that make him <br/>
cry) or even tell him that he drives me crazy.<br/>
<br/>
I hate myself when I do that. For instance, the other day, I picked <br/>
him up at school and asked him to do something with me, instead of <br/>
waiting for my husband to go home and do it himself. He began to cry <br/>
that he didn&#39;t want to - and I became really ... (sorry, can&#39;t find <br/>
my words) ... hard, speaking in a very severe tone and quite loud. <br/>
After that, I thought that it must have been very hard for him, not <br/>
only the fact that I was so unsensitive and selfish and mean, but <br/>
also that I did it in front of his friends. I thought that it must <br/>
be very hard to have his own mother being so disrespectful (???).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not very often, but it&#39;s like there are some &quot;blind spots&quot; <br/>
where I act in complete contradiction with my strongest beliefs, <br/>
where I can&#39;t find the resource to step back for a while.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why I was anxious to know if, some time, I would be able to <br/>
do so even in these occasions. I&#39;m really afraid that these <br/>
explosions ruin all the efforts I&#39;m doing the rest of the time (when <br/>
I&#39;m saying *efforts* ... it&#39;s not always hard, I like being with <br/>
them, I find them cool most of the time ;))<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks anyway<br/>

<br/>
  It seems that way because we&#39;ve worked really hard at it. Some had to <br/>
work harder. It depends on the baggage you&#39;re carrying. Getting rid of <br/>
your parents&#39; voices (if they were the same way you&#39;re acting) helps a <br/>
lot!<br/>
<br/>
  The more mindful I tried to be, the more mindful I became. I asked the <br/>
boys to help me too---if they saw me getting edgy, they could tell me. <br/>
That helped me too.<br/>
<br/>
  I still snap sometimes. I snapped at Duncan this past week, but I <br/>
apologized later. He said that was OK---he could tell I was a little <br/>
stressed. &lt;g&gt; Sweet boy. And patient with me!<br/>

  I hate to be late too. But if you *know* it *could* happen, ask <br/>
yourself what would be the worst thing that could happen---you&#39;d be <br/>

  Bite your tongue and think what would you do without him. That helps <br/>
me a LOT. If he were no longer here, wouldn&#39;t you miss that crying?<br/>

It seems that way because we&#39;ve worked really hard at it. Some had <br/>
to work harder. It depends on the baggage you&#39;re carrying. Getting <br/>
rid of your parents&#39; voices (if they were the same way you&#39;re <br/>
acting) helps a lot!<br/>
<br/>
- My answer : <br/>
<br/>
Yes, I&#39;m sure you worked hard at it and certainly didn&#39;t mean to <br/>
minimize that. It&#39;s good to read it, still, because it gives me <br/>
confidence in my ability to get there :) <br/>

Bite your tongue and think what would you do without him. That helps <br/>

Many thanks for that. It&#39;s something I often think about, because <br/>
life can be so unpredictable. Anyway, I never tried to remember that <br/>
in the heat of the moment - thank you. <br/>

 My mother apologizes and says she&#39;ll never do it again.<br/>
<br/>
 She does it again and again and again.<br/>
<br/>
  And apologizes again and again and again. And swears she won&#39;t do it <br/>
again. Riiiight.<br/>
<br/>
 The trust is gone. I don&#39;t believe her any more.<br/>
<br/>
  And now---finally---I don&#39;t put myself in a position to allow her to <br/>
do it any more.<br/>

  No one has to accept an apology. And one made without sincerity <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m glad to read that the *good* reaction will become more and more<br/>
&gt; natural and that eventually I&#39;ll might stop being unfair and mean<br/>
&gt; with my children. It&#39;s a process, all right.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Actually, I&#39;m working on it for years now, but it seems so natural<br/>
&gt; for you and so connected with a whole philosophy of life ...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; --=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  It seems that way because we&#39;ve worked really hard at it. Some had to <br/>
&gt; work harder. It depends on the baggage you&#39;re carrying. Getting rid of <br/>
&gt; your parents&#39; voices (if they were the same way you&#39;re acting) helps a <br/>
&gt; lot!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  The more mindful I tried to be, the more mindful I became. I asked the <br/>
&gt; boys to help me too---if they saw me getting edgy, they could tell me. <br/>
&gt; That helped me too.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  I still snap sometimes. I snapped at Duncan this past week, but I <br/>
&gt; apologized later. He said that was OK---he could tell I was a little <br/>
&gt; stressed. &lt;g&gt; Sweet boy. And patient with me!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My problem is that, when the pressure is high inside me (and it can<br/>
&gt; be for very small things), I act in complete opposition with what I<br/>
&gt; believe is true and good (well, I guess that you already understood<br/>
&gt; this part).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  Do you feel it coming on? You might like to try &quot;Rescue <br/>
&gt; Remedy&quot;---drops that can lower that pressure.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -==-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Concrete examples ?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For instance, we are expected somewhere (school for instance, as ds<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t unschooled yet, or doctor, or dinner at my parents) and we get<br/>
&gt; late. Shouldn&#39;t be a big issue, but for me, it actually becomes one,<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know why. So I can deal with that very calmly (good days) or<br/>
&gt; I can explode and yell on everybody (bad days).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; --=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  I hate to be late too. But if you *know* it *could* happen, ask <br/>
&gt; yourself what would be the worst thing that could happen---you&#39;d be <br/>
&gt; late? &lt;g&gt; Deep breaths, a few drops of Rescue Remedy.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Another example : my son can cry in a way that makes me crazy. I<br/>
&gt; KNOW I shoudln&#39;t, but I can be sarcastic about it (sorry I can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; translate what I tell him, but I minimize the reasons that make him<br/>
&gt; cry) or even tell him that he drives me crazy.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  Bite your tongue and think what would you do without him. That helps <br/>
&gt; me a LOT. If he were no longer here, wouldn&#39;t you miss that crying?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I hate myself when I do that. For instance, the other day, I picked<br/>
&gt; him up at school and asked him to do something with me, instead of<br/>
&gt; waiting for my husband to go home and do it himself. He began to cry<br/>
&gt; that he didn&#39;t want to - and I became really ... (sorry, can&#39;t find<br/>
&gt; my words) ... hard, speaking in a very severe tone and quite loud.<br/>
&gt; After that, I thought that it must have been very hard for him, not<br/>
&gt; only the fact that I was so unsensitive and selfish and mean, but<br/>
&gt; also that I did it in front of his friends. I thought that it must<br/>
&gt; be very hard to have his own mother being so disrespectful (???).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Apologize.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  Tell him you&#39;re trying to do better/be better. Ask for his help. If <br/>
&gt; you&#39;re starting to feel out of control, let him know that you need <br/>
&gt; space or that you are cranky. He&#39;ll keep his distance if he knows <br/>
&gt; you&#39;re edgy! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s not very often, but it&#39;s like there are some &quot;blind spots&quot;<br/>
&gt; where I act in complete contradiction with my strongest beliefs,<br/>
&gt; where I can&#39;t find the resource to step back for a while.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;ll get better. Keep working.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s why I was anxious to know if, some time, I would be able to<br/>
&gt; do so even in these occasions. I&#39;m really afraid that these<br/>
&gt; explosions ruin all the efforts I&#39;m doing the rest of the time (when<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m saying *efforts* ... it&#39;s not always hard, I like being with<br/>
&gt; them, I find them cool most of the time ;))<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  As to whether you will be able to do so even on these occasions: Do <br/>
&gt; you want to?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then DO! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  And although you&#39;re not spanking, you might find Pam&#39;s <br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:NoMoreSpanking@yahoogroups.com">NoMoreSpanking@yahoogroups.com</a> e-list helpful. The folks there can help <br/>
&gt; give you tools to deal with the anger in a more peaceful manner.<br/>

 I wanted to point this out because it happens regularly.<br/>
<br/>
  The person with the original question/concern may or may not get <br/>
anything out of the discussion at all. It just doesn&#39;t hit home. <br/>
Sometimes the original poster cuts and runs shortly after posting, <br/>
disgusted with us. Sometimes she sits and struggles for quite a while. <br/>
Sometimes she leaves and comes back a few weeks/months later after <br/>
chewing on it some more.<br/>
<br/>
  But because it&#39;s a general discussion of a situation or problem, many <br/>
other posters and/or lurkers come away with new insights. Sometimes <br/>
light bulbs go off everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
  We try not to make it personal. We&#39;re responding to the points made. <br/>
Unless we&#39;ve met you at a conference or in our home towns, we don&#39;t <br/>
know you at all. It&#39;s really not personal. We get nit-picky about <br/>
&quot;semantics&quot; because the way you refer to things and the words you use <br/>
can change the way you act and think. It *really* is important.<br/>
<br/>
  To us, the owners and moderators, unschooling is not just about not <br/>
doing school. It goes deeper than that. We all believe that it&#39;s a way <br/>
of life, a philosophy, that encompasses every thing we and our children <br/>
do. It&#39;s *knowing* that children are natural learners, in every <br/>
way---not just academically.<br/>
<br/>
  If you see them as doing their very best with the tools and and <br/>
abilities that they have *now*, it&#39;ll free you up to see what all they <br/>
are capable of doing without being &quot;taught.&quot; That&#39;s why we dig deeper <br/>
than just academics, because we know it works. We see it in our own <br/>
children and in each others&#39; kids.<br/>

<br/>
*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br/>
<br/>
I remember that, the first time I seriously considered unschooling <br/>
my children, I felt a big flow of energy inside of me. It was as if <br/>
I had touched a crucial point, something I HAD to do. For reasons <br/>
too long to explain, it didn&#39;t last, and for months, I couldn&#39;t feel <br/>
that vibe again. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m convinced that we have a kind of inner compass, and that we can <br/>
tell what&#39;s good (at least for ourselves) from what&#39;s not. That <br/>
there are such things as intrinsically &quot;good&quot; things - the things <br/>
that bring life and joy and togetherness (???)and bad ones - the <br/>
ones that destroy and that split us from our inner self / our kids / <br/>
etc. (That&#39;s the point where I become SO frustrated because my words <br/>
betray my thoughts and I&#39;m really afraid of being misunderstood)<br/>
<br/>
So my kid began school and did like it ... three days ! I kept <br/>
sending him, because I didn&#39;t really know what else to do and also <br/>
because I was 8-months pregnant and needed rest (not a very good <br/>
reason, I agree). As school is only part-time, I became used to <br/>
spend time with him (since then, I was studying and working, so his <br/>
sister and him were at daycare) and I started to think again ... <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure that I would be the best mom in town but I&#39;m totally <br/>
certain that unschooling, even as difficult as it looks, would do us <br/>
good. Like you said, and that&#39;s was were this long speech was <br/>
supposed to bring me, it&#39;s a whole, it goes further than just <br/>
academics - and I hope I wont be disappointed, because I really <br/>
expect quite a lot from this change. <br/>
<br/>
I have the feeling that, since my kids were born, I have maintained <br/>
two levels in my parenting, attachment parenting in one hand, <br/>
and &quot;distance parenting&quot; in the other. I knew that I was <br/>
quite &quot;adapted&quot; to the mainstream, and I was afraid of trying more <br/>
radical things, so I did a bit of both and hoped that my kids and I <br/>
would find a balance like that.<br/>
<br/>
I found that these compromises didn&#39;t work that well. Something <br/>
prevents me from being the parent I really want to be. Of course, a <br/>
big part of it is the way I have been parented myself, the inner <br/>
voices I still have, my own anger issues, all these things. But I <br/>
wonder if there isn&#39;t something else, I wonder if it wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
easier to dive in the big pool than to go back and forth the whole <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
Well. I can&#39;t put this in words properly. I hope that you got the <br/>
general idea and, anyway, I thank the people who are still reading <br/>
my broken English.<br/>
