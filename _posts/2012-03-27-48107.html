<div id="ygrps-yiv-1407273187">There&#39;s going to be a small radical unschooling symposium, Always Learning Live, May 18-20 at the YMCA Harrington Outdoor Center in Boylston, MA. The lodge (with bunk beds) has been reserved for staying over. There are also camp sites available. (More information at the website.)<br/>

Both Sandra and Meredith are taking requests for what you&#39;d like to hear :-) (Such a deal!)<br/>
<br/>
Rather than a conference with loads of speakers and kid activities to choose from -- for which there is the really awesome Northeast Unschooling Conference each August!<br/>

<br/>
-- the symposium is small and focused primarily on talks and discussion. The main speaker is Sandra Dodd with the other speakers drawn from her Always Learning list, thus Always Learning Live :-)<br/>
<br/>
Speakers are:<br/>
<br/>
Sandra Dodd<br/>
Meredith Novak<br/>
Brie Jontry<br/>
Joyce Fetteroll<br/>
<br/>
Do note that the camp is right next to a lake -- but no one will be allowed to swim in it! (The lifeguards would be prohibitively expensive unfortunately.) So if you think it would be torture for your kids (or you or your spouse! :-) to be that close to water and not be able to go in, the Northeast Unschooling Conference would be much more fun for you :-)<br/>
