<div id="ygrps-yiv-610355141">I joined this group about a week ago, intending to read only and not post, <br/>
but something came accross my mind this morning.<br/>
My husband and I were talking about how much we would have loved it if we <br/>
had met each other in our teens.  (We finally did meet at age 24).  We <br/>
speculated about how we each were at ages 15-18, and concluded that if we <br/>
had met back then, we&#39;d have hit it off just as well as we did at 24.<br/>
However, in our society, the expectation is that you wait until you&#39;re at <br/>
least as old as Methusela until you THINK of finding &quot;the one&quot;.  Even when <br/>
we got married at age 26, people still told us we were too young.  The <br/>
expectation is that you definitely don&#39;t marry the one you date when you are <br/>
in your mid to late teens, and if you do, the marriage is doomed for sure.<br/>
I looked at zenmomma&#39;s pictures from the confrence on her blog, and there&#39;s <br/>
one pic there where a couple of the teens look like they kind of like each <br/>
other.  It got me thinking.  Unschooling parents are champions at following <br/>
their child&#39;s lead, treating their opinions with respect, and validating <br/>
their kids&#39; experiences.  That being said, what if your teen was dating <br/>
someone for quite sometime, and then someitme around age 16-19 ish, told you <br/>
that this person was &quot;the one&quot;?  Both of them were sure of it?  Would you <br/>
support that, or would you lean towards the societal expectation that teen <br/>
relationships can&#39;t survive?  Unschoolers seem to me like they would mostly <br/>
support their child, and believe them when they say that that person is &quot;the <br/>
one&quot;.<br/>
What&#39;s your take?<br/>

What&#39;s your take?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
**My husband and I were in college when we met - I was 19 and he was 21. We <br/>
married 2 years later without telling anyone (for a few years they just <br/>
thought we were living together). This December will be our 13th wedding <br/>
anniversary and I feel like we&#39;re still going strong...<br/>
<br/>
I think if I were to look at my child when he is older and dating (he&#39;s only <br/>
2.5 right now) I would look at it from the perspective that I am trying to <br/>
develop now. That is, I would trust his feelings and we would talk about <br/>
things in depth - including the idea of marriage. My dh and I didn&#39;t get <br/>
married because we felt it would strengthen our relationship or for <br/>
religious reasons or anything like that - we just got married because his <br/>
job had very good health benefits and there were no domestic partner <br/>
benefits at that time (we were living in Ohio). Therefore, I think I would <br/>
bring up all the ideas of marriage in our society and see how he feels about <br/>
them - along with the idea that people can be together for many years (even <br/>
a lifetime) and never be married. We know several couples like this - gay <br/>
and straight.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the idea of &quot;the one&quot;, I wouldn&#39;t negate his opinion on it because <br/>
I&#39;ve seen that backfire in my own family with my mother trying to control my <br/>
and my brothers&#39; relationships during high school. Whenever she started to <br/>
deny the feelings we had that a particular person was &quot;the one&quot;, it only <br/>
brought us closer together with that person and it was harder to determine <br/>
for ourselves that maybe this person wasn&#39;t &quot;the one&quot; later when the <br/>
relationship was rocky. In essence, mom fighting our feelings strengthened <br/>
the bond between this person and one of us (me or my brothers) as a united <br/>
front against my mother. The relationship ended up lasting far longer than <br/>
it probably would have if she hadn&#39;t interfered - probably just because we <br/>
felt like we needed to prove her wrong.<br/>
<br/>
When looking at a lot of society&#39;s ideas of age regarding different <br/>
activities (dating, marriage, drinking, driving, voting, having children, <br/>
going off to war, etc.), age is so arbitrary. Some &quot;adults&quot; (even the idea <br/>
of 18 as when someone becomes an adult) are not ready for many of these <br/>
activities well into their adulthood and many teenagers surprise us with <br/>
their abilities to handle many of these things very well. As with all things <br/>
unschooling (as far as I&#39;ve come to understand it all), I think it comes <br/>
down to knowing your child and what their life experience has helped them <br/>
understand - and being there as a parent in case things don&#39;t go as they <br/>
planned.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-588637148">This is really interesting and something I myself have been thinking about recently.  My DS is 12 (almost 13) and his girlfriend (of seven months) is just turning 15.  She moved away soon after they met so they don&#39;t see each other very often but are always on the phone (we bought an internet phone specifically for that purpose) or on MSN armed with their webcams !<br/>
   <br/>
  Its really quite sweet but has also given me pause for thought because of their ages, the age difference, geographical distance, etc.  DS got really upset when I recently told him that I didn&#39;t think I could take him there and back for the weekend (its a two hour journey one-way).  I was thinking - its just a teenage crush,etc , can&#39;t be serious as they don&#39;t actually &#39;see&#39; each other, are too young, etc.<br/>
   <br/>
  I remembered that my Mum met my Dad when she was 13 (he was 18) and they&#39;ve been together ever since (Mum now 56, Dad 61), and also how strong my feelings were for boys when I was younger (in fact I swear the first time i fell &#39;in love&#39; I was 10, he was 12 !).  Plus I tried to see it from an &#39;unschooling&#39; point of view and figured he was getting a lot from the relationship whatever and decided to support him (instead of belittling the relationship, his feelings, etc - which is effectively what deeming them too young is).<br/>
   <br/>
  So we&#39;ve bought him an internet phone (saves our phone bills !), have arranged trips for them to meet up (she&#39;s catching a lift to us with friends, we&#39;re visiting a conference and dropping him off at her&#39;s on the way, etc).  We&#39;ve even had fun together trying to find an original gift he can post her for her birthday !<br/>
   <br/>
  Don&#39;t really think the safe sex thing is an issue yet (though I had to fight him for my friends two month old today !!) but we&#39;ve always been open and honest with him about such matters and I trust him to take care when the time comes.  But we&#39;ll cross that bridge when we come to it !<br/>
   <br/>
  Just my opinion <br/>

we&#39;ve been married for 19 years) I&#39;d support them wholeheartedly. Even if it<br/>
didn&#39;t work out why would you treat them any differently than you would if<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1847722394">Hi there - &quot;Methuselah&quot; here LOL - I was 33 when DH and I got <br/>
married (okay, technically I was 32 for the first 27 days of our <br/>
marriage). He was 25 when we married. So, in some cases, you might <br/>
not end up with the same person - I was 2 years out of college when <br/>
he graduated high school! It&#39;s not that I wasn&#39;t looking - I just <br/>
didn&#39;t find anyone who fit the bill so to speak. <br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t think the bottom line is about age at all though. I <br/>
know &#39;high school sweethearts&#39; who are still together 60 years <br/>
later. I know &#39;high school sweethearts&#39; who went bust in under 5 <br/>
years. I know later marrieds who have been together for many years <br/>
and later marrieds who are on their 2nd or 3rd spouse. I know folks <br/>
who have lived together (gay and straight) for years. I know folks <br/>
for whom living together killed the relationship (the toenail <br/>
clippings and all that little stuff you don&#39;t see much if you aren&#39;t <br/>
there together 24/7). Most people who know us but met us after we <br/>
got married assume that DH is older (that&#39;s why I won&#39;t &quot;let&quot; him <br/>
remove his facial hair - he&#39;s still got such a &#39;baby face&#39; that I&#39;d <br/>
get arrested for transporting a minor across state lines...lol). <br/>
That was kind of fun when I was 37 and having DS (our one and only) <br/>
and they thought I was maybe 23 or 24! I think it runs in my family <br/>
maybe - I was 32/33 when I got married and DH is 8 yrs younger; my <br/>
brother is 1 1/2 yrs younger than I am and he married at about 32 to <br/>
someone a decade younger; my sister is 5 yrs younger than I am and <br/>
married at 27 to someone who is slightly older than I am (if you&#39;re <br/>
following the math, I got married then 7 months later my sister got <br/>
married then 1 1/2 years after her my brother got married); my dad <br/>
was 29 when he married mom, she was 22. On the other hand, DH&#39;s mom <br/>
and dad married right after his mom graduated high school, his dad <br/>
is about 5 years older I think (he was out of college and in the Air <br/>
Force by the time they married so that&#39;s probably a pretty close <br/>
guess). DH&#39;s sister #1 (2 yrs younger than he is) married at 27/28 <br/>
(not sure how old her hubby is - his DD from a previous marriage was <br/>
about 8 at the wedding so he was somewhere upward of 26 at the <br/>
time). DH&#39;s sister #2 is about 23 now and has had several <br/>
relationships that lasted from months to years since she was &quot;high <br/>
school age&quot; (MIL homeschooled both #2 and #3 for middle school/high <br/>
school). DH&#39;s sister #2 is 21 now and has had several relationships <br/>
of varying lengths including the one that led to my  nephew who just <br/>
turned 3 (he was born one month after she turned 18).<br/>
<br/>
If DS found someone who made him content and joyful (happy is a <br/>
transient kind of thing) at 18, great. If not, okay. If he never <br/>
married/had a long term relationship and was okay with that in <br/>
himself, fine (though that would pretty much kill the &#39;family name&#39; <br/>
lol). If he didn&#39;t find that person until he was 30, okay.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1455463759">Oh but they can :-) My husband and I met when I was 16 and he was 18. I  <br/>
moved in with him at 17 and we were married just after I turned 18. We put  <br/>
ourselves through college and struggled financially until graduation -- we had  our <br/>
first child at 23 and 25 and now at age 30 we have three children. <br/>
 <br/>
I struggle to believe in &quot;the one&quot; and &quot;soul mates&quot; I prefer to think that  <br/>
certain personalities are more prepared to mesh with another soul but my <br/>
husband  strongly believes that we are soul mates. (He believes this mainly because <br/>
he  and my father share the same name and birthdate and because the summation <br/>
of our  two birth dates equals the date that we conceived our first child.)<br/>
 <br/>
So we have been married for twelve years now. <br/>
<br/>
That  being said,  what if your teen was dating <br/>
someone for quite sometime,  and then someitme  around age 16-19 ish, told <br/>
you <br/>
that this person  was &quot;the one&quot;?  Both  of them were sure of it?  Would you  <br/>
support that, or would you lean  towards the societal expectation  that teen <br/>
relationships can&#39;t  survive?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-539197848"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; What&#39;s your take?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve stopped caring about what society thinks a long time ago.  <br/>
<br/>
I met my hubby right after my 20th birthday and married 2 years <br/>
later.  We&#39;ve been married for 9 years.  We got all kinds of looks <br/>
when I had my first child at age 23.  <br/>
<br/>
My daughters are still young (5 & 7) but this is one of reasons I <br/>
love unschool.  We talk about everything.  I believe that this <br/>
respect, trust and discussion will continue into the teen years so <br/>
they won&#39;t feel as I did when my parents dismissed my feelings about <br/>
getting married.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling allows children to find out who they are, probably <br/>
earlier than most, so they may be ready to marry at 16 or 19, if <br/>
they choose this path. I believe that with all the years of respect, <br/>
trust and discussion ahead of us that I will be supportive of any <br/>
marriage decision my girls make.<br/>
<br/>
FYI - In ancient times couples would go through a ceremony and live <br/>
as legally married for a year and a day. At that time they would <br/>
decide if they wanted to continue in the marriage (and have another <br/>
ceremony) or go their separate ways without stigma attached (able to <br/>
remarry someone else, owning all the property brought to the <br/>
marriage, etc).<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-215537787">I think this &quot;issue&quot; only matters and only would be a problem if you  <br/>
have a problem with someone marrying more than once, having children  <br/>
with different fathers/mothers etc. So I think this is only a problem  <br/>
for maybe religious (or other) people who couldn&#39;t accept for  <br/>
themselves and neither for their children to re-marry whenever they  <br/>
want. Of course, also non-religious people can have the ideal of  <br/>
having only one in his/her whole life, but besides from being a bit  <br/>
disappointed nothing &quot;bad&quot; happens if you don&#39;t go with this ideal  <br/>
and break up. In many religions though it seems to me that it is not  <br/>
well seen and something &quot;bad&quot; will happen if you don&#39;t follow the  <br/>
rules – I wonder then, if unschooling is possible while being very  <br/>
religious? Maybe if you are so tolerant that you really - *really* -  <br/>
don&#39;t mind if your child doesn&#39;t follow the same religion or with the  <br/>
same accuracy or... etc.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise there can&#39;t be any problem with an unschooling parent to  <br/>
&quot;let&quot; their children marry at what age they want, because in case it  <br/>
doesn&#39;t work out, that parent would be there for his/her child, and  <br/>
NOT saying &quot;well I told you – you see what happens if you marry too  <br/>
young?? now you clean up your mess alone!&quot; I think it would still be  <br/>
unschooling if you told your children your opinion if it was wanted,  <br/>
as long as you aren&#39;t trying a tiny little bit to manipulate your  <br/>
child :-)<br/>
<br/>
The other day, my best friend (unschooling&#39;s enemy herself!) asked me  <br/>
a similar question, what I would do if my daughter wanted to marry at  <br/>
the age of 18 but a 46 year old rapist who just came out of prison  <br/>
but who she says she really trusts that he &quot;has changed&quot; and so on  <br/>
and if I&#39;d still &quot;be there for her&quot; and &quot;support her&quot;... hmmmmmm<br/>

<br/>
Let me elaborate a little more on that.  They piss me off because the person<br/>
doing the asking has probably already asked a million real questions that<br/>
you had a good answer for but in order for them to follow your advice they<br/>
would have to give up control and fear.  <br/>
<br/>
So then, they move on to questions that you couldn&#39;t possibly answer because<br/>
if what you are doing (unschooling) works then your kids won&#39;t end up 18<br/>
years old wanting to marry a convict.  But what if they did, would you<br/>
support that too?  I&#39;d probably just put a bullet in my head for being so<br/>
stupid for so long.  I wouldn’t be able to live with myself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2085984784">Thank you Angela for this! :-) It is true that she kind of lives in  <br/>
fear, but she says she&#39;s not. Whatever! And of COURSE, she did ask me  <br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s really about what *I* feel in this situation. I can approve or condemn but that&#39;s not going to change how *they* feel. Going through the stages of a relationship will do that. Time will tell if they&#39;ll grow together or apart. *They* will come to understand each other and themselves with each passing day, month, year.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;d sit by mutely and watch my child make HUGE life altering decisions without input from me. But I&#39;d try to keep it respectful of their feelings and intelligence. So far, my kids have been pretty open to listening to my ramblings on relationships, sex, friendships, love, etc. <br/>
<br/>
I recently had such a discussion with an 18 year old unschooler (not mine). He wanted to know if I thought a relationship started at age 15 could be &quot;the one.&quot; His girlfriend recently went off to college so they&#39;re dealing with separation issues. Since I met my dh at 15 I told him what I&#39;ve found to be true for us. We did end up being the one for each other, but we needed time apart to discover our own selves as well. I told him it sucked, but it was the best thing we ever did for our longterm relationship. I like to be honest.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I joined this group about a week ago, intending to read only and not post, <br/>
&gt; but something came accross my mind this morning.<br/>
&gt; My husband and I were talking about how much we would have loved it if we <br/>
&gt; had met each other in our teens.  (We finally did meet at age 24).  We <br/>
&gt; speculated about how we each were at ages 15-18, and concluded that if we <br/>
&gt; had met back then, we&#39;d have hit it off just as well as we did at 24.<br/>
&gt; However, in our society, the expectation is that you wait until you&#39;re at <br/>
&gt; least as old as Methusela until you THINK of finding &quot;the one&quot;.  Even when <br/>
&gt; we got married at age 26, people still told us we were too young.  The <br/>
&gt; expectation is that you definitely don&#39;t marry the one you date when you are <br/>
&gt; in your mid to late teens, and if you do, the marriage is doomed for sure.<br/>
&gt; I looked at zenmomma&#39;s pictures from the confrence on her blog, and there&#39;s <br/>
&gt; one pic there where a couple of the teens look like they kind of like each <br/>
&gt; other.  It got me thinking.  Unschooling parents are champions at following <br/>
&gt; their child&#39;s lead, treating their opinions with respect, and validating <br/>
&gt; their kids&#39; experiences.  That being said, what if your teen was dating <br/>
&gt; someone for quite sometime, and then someitme around age 16-19 ish, told you <br/>
&gt; that this person was &quot;the one&quot;?  Both of them were sure of it?  Would you <br/>

  I recently had such a discussion with an 18 year old unschooler (not <br/>
mine). He<br/>
  wanted to know if I thought a relationship started at age 15 could be <br/>
&quot;the one.&quot;<br/>
  His girlfriend recently went off to college so they&#39;re dealing with <br/>
separation<br/>
  issues. Since I met my dh at 15 I told him what I&#39;ve found to be true <br/>
for us. We<br/>
  did end up being the one for each other, but we needed time apart to <br/>
discover<br/>
  our own selves as well. I told him it sucked, but it was the best <br/>
thing we ever<br/>
 did for our longterm relationship. I like to be honest.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 That 18 year old was my Cameron.<br/>
<br/>
  We&#39;ve talked a LOT about this. He and Carly are quite serious: they&#39;ve <br/>
been dating for 3.5 years. People change so much from 18-25. I&#39;ve <br/>
suggested that he give it time. She&#39;s not truly on board with <br/>
unschooling or our lifestyle (although she LOVES to spend time here and <br/>
is always angry with her mom and wishes that RUE was her mother <br/>
instead! &lt;G&gt;). She still thinks that children need school. And that <br/>
they need rules. But that&#39;s how *her* life has been.<br/>
<br/>
 She&#39;d rather have had Cam&#39;s life, but...<br/>
<br/>
  Her father died four years ago, and her parents&#39; marriage was rocky <br/>
then at best. Seeing my relationship with Ben has been really good for <br/>
her. (So her mom tells me.) She&#39;d never seen spouses really get along.<br/>
<br/>
  When they first started dating, her mom didn&#39;t like Cam because she <br/>
*knew* he&#39;d be worthless and stupid for being UNschooled. He&#39;s... <br/>
uh...changed her mind a bit! &lt;G&gt; She adores him now! He&#39;s respectful <br/>
and kind and generous and cares sooo much for Carly. But he has no <br/>
problem standing up for himself OR Carly in front of her mother. Kinda <br/>
cool. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  He&#39;s having lunch with her soon, I think, and will give her Rue&#39;s book <br/>
and tell her that it&#39;s NOT too late to repair her relationship with her <br/>
daughter. (Yikes! Where&#39;d he get those balls??? &lt;G&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
  The big issues *I* see are the strained relationship with her mom, our <br/>
unschooling lifestyle, college---it changes people, and distance <br/>
(currently she&#39;s 1.5 hours away).<br/>
<br/>
  Well, that and Ren&#39;s desperate need to hook Cameron up with Brenna! <br/>
&lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Do I think young relationships can work longterm? You bet. I&#39;ve seen <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
  Do I think people change a great deal from 18-15? You bet! I&#39;ve seen <br/>
it, and I did!<br/>
<br/>
  Do I think relationships can survive long distance? You bet. Ben and I <br/>
did it!<br/>
<br/>
  I think people with more similar backgrounds may have it easier---and <br/>
I guess that&#39;s what I&#39;m more concerned about. Our unschooling <br/>
background may make it hard to jive with a more conservative, <br/>
rule-based background.<br/>
<br/>
  I think Cameron and Carly could work this out for the long-term, but I <br/>
have suggested that they take their time and not marry right away. They <br/>
may or may not take my &quot;sage&quot; advice. &lt;bwg&gt; Either way, I&#39;ll stand <br/>
behind them. We love Carly and feel she&#39;s already part of the family.<br/>
<br/>
 We&#39;ll see.<br/>
