<div id="ygrps-yiv-132990005">my 7 year old daughter is soooooo in to legos.  Esp star wars.  She is rather good and puts them together all by herself and makes Lego stop motion films and puts them on youtube.  We are in Sunny Fl.  If you would like to have them be pen pals email me off list :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2011812307">We&#39;ve gotten great responses and found people all over the country!  This is really fun!<br/>
<br/>
The writing is the means, not the end.  The &quot;end&quot; (for us) is fun, communication, exploring <br/>
different people and places, doing cool stuff with the computer.  My son says it&#39;s fun <br/>
&quot;because you can compare different places and environments, and send messages all over <br/>
the country&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 I find this list thought provoking and  challenging, and really appreciate the efforts of <br/>
those who post.<br/>
