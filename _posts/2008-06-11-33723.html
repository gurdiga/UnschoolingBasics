<div id="ygrps-yiv-841509222">I was having a discussion over lunch with a coworker (intern, 19 <br/>
years old, just finished his first year of college). We often discuss <br/>
unschooling topics because he for the most part thinks it makes more <br/>
sense than institutional schooling. The topic du jour, however, was a <br/>
lifestyle (RU) issue and I&#39;d really like to find some reading <br/>
materials to pass along on it so he can ponder it more slowly than in <br/>
a discussion.<br/>
<br/>
We were discussing the concept of &#39;earning&#39; things. For instance, if <br/>
a kid wants money to buy something, let the kid do a &#39;chore&#39; such as <br/>
cleaning their room to earn an agreed-upon amount of money. I was <br/>
trying to point out that if you applied the same logic in an adult-<br/>
adult situation (for example, an at-home mom earning the money to buy <br/>
a pair of shoes by scrubbing and waxing the kitchen floor) it doesn&#39;t <br/>
fly really well but it&#39;s considered perfectly okay in an adult-child <br/>
relationship. He tried to say that since his wife would definitely <br/>
have a job, that wouldn&#39;t apply. I said Well, what if she makes $10K <br/>
per year and you make $5K per year (easy numbers to work with) - does <br/>
that mean that she has $5K to spend as she pleases and if you want <br/>
more than your own $5K that you earned at your employment, you have <br/>
to ask her to pay you for &#39;chores&#39; around the house? His response was <br/>
that in a couple, the money is shared in common. I said, well then <br/>
why doesn&#39;t that apply to any children in the household too since <br/>
they are in the same position, economically, as the non-employed <br/>
partner? He was getting a bit flustered and lunch was over so we <br/>
quit. <br/>
<br/>
I KNOW there&#39;s some really well written stuff out there but I can&#39;t <br/>
find it - Help! I browsed around Sandra&#39;s site and didn&#39;t find what <br/>
I&#39;m looking for (though there was lots of other good stuff there). <br/>
Anyone? Anyone? Bueller?....<br/>

I think where the thinking derailed is that he&#39;s seeing the world  <br/>
through adult eyes and imposing a solution that seems reasonable to  <br/>
that viewpoint onto a child. But the child sees the world  <br/>
differently. Imposing an adult viewpoint (and solution) won&#39;t force  <br/>
him to change from a child&#39;s viewpoint to an adult&#39;s. Time, age,  <br/>
growth, maturity will do that. He&#39;ll have an adult&#39;s view point when  <br/>
he&#39;s an adult.<br/>
<br/>
Kids will understand better if our solutions match their view of the  <br/>
world. To a child, parents have money that they spend on stuff the  <br/>
parents want all the time. And the parents have an &quot;It&#39;s mine!&quot;  <br/>
attitude towards the money. Occasionally they&#39;ll begrudgingly share a  <br/>
bit, if they agree with what the child wants.<br/>
<br/>
While it&#39;s not a completely accurate picture (though more accurate  <br/>
than adults will admit!) it&#39;s not a picture a child can be argued out  <br/>
of. It&#39;s just how they&#39;ll view the world until they&#39;re older.<br/>
<br/>
If an adult lived that way, having to go through the process of  <br/>
convincing their partner that every purchase was worthy and then wait  <br/>
for approval, not only would it be frustrating but it wouldn&#39;t do  <br/>
much for the relationship!<br/>
<br/>
Why should kids feel differently? Kids see parents spending hundreds  <br/>
of dollars at the grocery store for stuff the parents want (and stuff  <br/>
the parents approve of for the kids) and the kids can&#39;t have a candy  <br/>
bar at the check out?<br/>
<br/>
The downside of holding tight to our money until a child jumps  <br/>
through a hoop for it is that it models being closed and Scroogy with  <br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
The upside of generosity is that 1) it models that behavior for kids  <br/>
and 2) they feel full rather than needy. When they&#39;re full, they are  <br/>
way more likely to feel generous (with their time, money, patience,  <br/>
etc.) with others.<br/>
<br/>
And generous doesn&#39;t mean just handing to them whatever they ask.  <br/>
Generous means seeing their needs as important and showing the child  <br/>
that you are willing to work to get those needs met. If, for  <br/>
instance, there&#39;s a limited food budget and my daughter wanted  <br/>
something, we could talk about what to cut back on so she could get  <br/>
that thing. When they see us working hard, they know things don&#39;t  <br/>
come for free. When they see us working hard for what they want, they  <br/>
will be generous and work hard to help us get what we want. (Not just  <br/>
a theory! Lots of parents will corroborate this! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something I wrote a while ago that might help:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; #3. I make him do chores for money to EARN a toy<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>While from an adult point of view it seems reasonable, what you&#39;re<br/>
modeling is &quot;This is mine. [The money.] And if you want any of it,<br/>
I&#39;m going to make you jump through hoops to get it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Picture this: sister asks brother if she can borrow his box of 64<br/>
crayons and he says &quot;If you clean up my room, I&#39;ll let you have 3.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what you&#39;re modeling for him.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re on a budget, be patient with him as he struggles to<br/>
understand how the world works. (You can discuss how you and he can<br/>
cut down on food expenses so the money can be shifted to other<br/>
things. You can help him become a savvy shopper :-)<br/>
<br/>
But explaining why you can&#39;t do such and such isn&#39;t enough.** He has<br/>
to be old enough to really get the concepts. He might understand the<br/>
words, but when mom says she doesn&#39;t have the money when she&#39;s<br/>
handing over money left and right for things *she* wants (food,<br/>
clothing that&#39;s supposedly a gift for him that he doesn&#39;t even want,<br/>
etc.) then the world seems hugely confusing.  (Even worse is &quot;I don&#39;t<br/>
want to spend the money on that,&quot; which, from his viewpoint, he&#39;d get<br/>
punished for saying because it&#39;s been drilled into his head that *he*<br/>
has to share what&#39;s his when others ask.)<br/>
<br/>
** (And often it isn&#39;t true. It&#39;s that we don&#39;t want to, eg, we don&#39;t<br/>
want to eat beans and rice instead of meat one night to help him get<br/>
a toy. But the more we *help* them, the more they feel that we&#39;re on<br/>
their team working with them to help them get what they want, the<br/>
more we model generosity.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And to many, many adults, that relationship would be considered <br/>
unhealthy at the least and probably even abusive. On military bases <br/>
there are flyers put up in bathroom stalls and all kinds of other <br/>
places about how to get help if you are in an abusive relationship. <br/>
I think I may have seen the same type of flyers taped to the <br/>
bathroom wall at the OB&#39;s office. The fyers list some of the <br/>
behaviors that are considered abusive. A spouse controlling the <br/>
money is one of those abusive behaviors. <br/>
<br/>
Controlling money is not OK for an adult-adult relationship where <br/>
the adults at least have some choice and the ability to at least try <br/>
to get away. It&#39;s perfectly OK and even expected in a parent-child <br/>
relationship where the child does not have a choice, cannot get <br/>
away, does not have the ability to do for h**self.<br/>
