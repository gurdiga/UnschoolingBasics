<div id="ygrps-yiv-1070307564">I&#39;m having trouble distinguishing when I should say something &quot;RUish&quot;<br/>
and when I should just let things go. And I&#39;m a little sick today, so<br/>
might not make much sense. Here&#39;s the latest example: I read a blog<br/>
that I love, and get a lot out of. Recently, the author wrote a<br/>
suggestion that people keep stickers in their purse, and if they see a<br/>
child crying in a store, offer a sticker - one mom supporting another.<br/>
Just today, she wrote about a response she got... well, you can go<br/>
read it here:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://37days.typepad.com/37days/2008/05/i-stand-correct.html">http://37days.typepad.com/37days/2008/05/i-stand-correct.html</a><br/>
<br/>
but basically the person said she&#39;d take the sticker *away* from her<br/>
child, and why would you &#39;reward&#39; a child who was crying, and probably<br/>
her child would then cry every time they went to the store so they<br/>
could get a sticker. I did write a response to that, which is probably<br/>
kinda incoherent due to strong feelings and the aforementioned<br/>
sickness. I suggested they try to see things from the child&#39;s<br/>
perspective, and I also said if a child purposefully cried in a store<br/>
to get a sticker, that meant they weren&#39;t getting enough stickers at home!<br/>
<br/>
Then I questioned writing that. I do want folks to see there&#39;s a<br/>
different way to look at things... but I don&#39;t want to &quot;cram things&quot;<br/>
down someone&#39;s throat... (what does that even mean?). I know I feel,<br/>
too, that I need to respond *now* because of the ephemeral nature of<br/>
online discussion - if I waited to become centered and write out a<br/>
well-thought-out reply, the discussion would have &#39;moved on&#39;. I have<br/>
gotten positive responses from people - they hadn&#39;t heard of<br/>
non-coercive parenting until I said something, and are glad I spoke<br/>
up. I also know by speaking my beliefs, I&#39;m setting myself up for<br/>
disagreement from people. Normally, that&#39;s OK, I can stand in my<br/>
beliefs, but if for some reason I&#39;m feeling vulnerable then that&#39;s<br/>
tougher.<br/>
<br/>
All right, I&#39;m rambling now... how to be an advocate through more than<br/>
just living our lives? How to advocate in the larger world -<br/>
especially online - without totally pushing people away? Any<br/>
experience and thoughts would be appreciated. And if you wanted to<br/>
leave a centered, well-thought-out reply on Patti&#39;s post, that would<br/>
be OK, too. ;)<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>

<br/>
(If it is yours...)<br/>
<br/>
I thought it was great...especially pointing out that it&#39;s not a <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Yep, that was mine, and Alex&#39;s is right under that. I love Patti&#39;s<br/>
thoughtful reply.<br/>
<br/>
My question was less about this particular instance than it was asking<br/>
in general - when do I speak out? How can I do so without alienating<br/>
people - or do I need to worry about that? I know that some<br/>
unschooling advocates are VERY outspoken - but I think they turn quite<br/>
a few people off. I want to introduce the idea that there&#39;s a<br/>
different way to see things, and advocate for the children, but dont&#39;<br/>
want to push people away. Here&#39;s another example:<br/>
<br/>
I was at a party recently, and a couple was telling the story of<br/>
coming home earlier that day and finding their youngest daughter had<br/>
taped up every one of her drawings. The dad said, &quot;I thought we had<br/>
the tape put away!&quot; and the mom said, &quot;I guess she can reach that<br/>
drawer now!&quot; I said, &quot;Wow - that&#39;s fantastic! She was doing an art<br/>
show! Maybe you could invite some of her friends over?&quot; And the dad<br/>
said, &quot;Oh, no. I just painted that room! I&#39;m not going to have a<br/>
thousand dollar paint job ruined!&quot; His attitude was - of course, we<br/>
can&#39;t have these drawings on the wall!<br/>
<br/>
Of course, now, after some time, I can see I could have suggested a<br/>
win/win - picking a couple to frame & put up, finding something other<br/>
than tape to put them up with so it doesn&#39;t damage the wall, etc. But<br/>
at the time, I was silent, because what I *wanted* to say was &quot;So your<br/>
wall is more important than your daughter&#39;s creativity?&quot; Which I knew<br/>
was contentious. His wife picked up on my attitude - that it was<br/>
absolutely OK to decorate your home with kids&#39; artwork - and she was<br/>
saying things like &quot;It&#39;s OK&quot; to her husband. I get tongue-tied in<br/>
situations like that, because I do want to advocate for the child,<br/>
whom it *seems like* doesn&#39;t have a voice, and I want to introduce a<br/>
different way to look at things. A few other couples there were<br/>
responding in a mainstream way - oh, yeah, you have to keep tape away<br/>
from little ones!, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Writing this out just helped me see that I *don&#39;t know* what goes on<br/>
in their homes, these people weren&#39;t close friends, I know them from<br/>
the neighborhood farmer&#39;s market. I don&#39;t want to come across as &quot;all<br/>
knowing&quot; or superior - even though I apparently have that judgment in<br/>
me somewhere, unfortunately!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for helping me untangle all this - all thoughts appreciated!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I do exactly what you did - just go ahead and express my own true  <br/>
response. I&#39;d have said the exact same thing...&quot;Oh, cool, it is like  <br/>
she&#39;s having an art show! Maybe you could have a &quot;grand opening&quot; with  <br/>
cookies and tea or something.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
IF I get a negative reaction, I shut up. If I get a look like I&#39;m a  <br/>
little nuts - I just smile. I&#39;d say that most of the time I get  <br/>
&quot;You&#39;re a lot nicer than I am&quot; - literally those words. I say, &quot;Well,  <br/>
you can use my idea if you want.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
All said with a smile and very gently. They didn&#39;t come to me to ask  <br/>
for unschooling help, so I don&#39;t give advice directly, but just  <br/>
respond with some positive enthusiasm that just MIGHT help them see  <br/>
there are other responses possible. What often happens is that they  <br/>
also smile and they pick up on the good feeling of being supportive  <br/>
rather than obstructive. Sounds like, in your case, the mom caught the  <br/>
feeling - sensed the good that could come of the kind of attitude you  <br/>
expressed. That&#39;s great - it is enough if you leave her with a little  <br/>
sense that things could be more positive. Lots of times parents are  <br/>
inclined to be more supportive, but they have these voices in their  <br/>
heads saying it is not &quot;good parenting&quot; to allow kids to &quot;get away  <br/>
with&quot; stuff. You provided a countering voice to that message. It is IN  <br/>
her head now. A gentle voice saying, &quot;It is okay to go along with what  <br/>
your child wants.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-150208457">I&#39;ve run into situations like this with family members.  No one in my<br/>
husband&#39;s family has ever criticized our homeschool or parenting choices<br/>
(thank goodness), but they&#39;re all so conventional.  When you mentioned the<br/>
taped artwork, I immediately thought of my SIL&#39;s pristeen home.  Her<br/>
children&#39;s artwork is in clear frames on the fridge door.  That&#39;s about the<br/>
only public sign that three boys actually live in that house!<br/>
<br/>
Whenever something like that has come up I usually say something like,<br/>
&quot;Thank goodness I don&#39;t have a thousand dollar paint job!  We buy cheap<br/>
or used furniture and make everything washable.  Otherwise, I couldn&#39;t take<br/>
the stress.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I still have about 10 handprints on one wall that my 3 year old<br/>
(now 11 yo) daughter made with a rainbow stamp pad.  On another wall, we<br/>
still have red streamer decorations from my son&#39;s birthday party last<br/>
year. Sitting on the TV are some coiled pots that he made in an art class<br/>
several years ago.   My house isn&#39;t a place to display things.  It&#39;s a place<br/>
to live!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1607766157">And what about the food thing?  It really sticks in my craw when I&#39;m with<br/>
other folks -- and this is especially true with my husband&#39;s mother and<br/>

they eat &quot;3 more bites of&quot; meat or veggies or whatever.  At Easter, my 12 yo<br/>
nephew was clearing the table but wouldn&#39;t take his little brother&#39;s plate<br/>
to the kitchen because little brother &quot;hasn&#39;t eaten enough.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think that&#39;s a fine response. I wish I could come up with stuff <br/>
like that in the moment. I&#39;m the type that would&#39;ve blurted out <br/>
something like what you were thinking about the wall being more <br/>
important than the child. I&#39;m the one who tends to alienate others, <br/>
though that&#39;s not my intention.<br/>
<br/>
You said your piece. You can&#39;t control how others will take it. You <br/>
never know. That dad may have gone home and thought more about what <br/>
you said. Even if he didn&#39;t, maybe someone else did. <br/>
<br/>
I think the best way to advocate for RU or AP or breastfeeding or <br/>
whatever is to model the behavior, speak your truth about yourself <br/>
(not about others) and then let it go. Don&#39;t get attached to any <br/>
expected outcome.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1364330003">I live in a shared house with another single mom - between us we have 5 teenagers...the house is a bit run- down - it was formerly an up/down triplex that we now just kind of live all over.  One of the teenaged boys started to get interested in graffiti - and he and a friend of his started going out at nights and spray painting a semi-abandoned school nearby.  He told us about it - anyway, the point of this story is that we started letting him do it in the back of the house down the basement stairs and walls - he doesn&#39;t go out at night anymore (so he says, and I think he&#39;s telling me the truth) - but I just had to share that - I mean, it can all be painted over one day - they even paint over it after awile and go again - but that&#39;s what I love about a run-down house - you get to live in it rather than &quot;for&quot; it...we also don&#39;t hesitate to cut holes in the walls or floors to run internet wires or whatever - I know it can all be fixed later - it&#39;s so liberating!  And such a blessing to just not have to worry about it....Judy R in Kingston loving the unschooling life with 5 teenagers!<br/>

  Subject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: When to say something?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve run into situations like this with family members. No one in my<br/>
  husband&#39;s family has ever criticized our homeschool or parenting choices<br/>
  (thank goodness), but they&#39;re all so conventional. When you mentioned the<br/>
  taped artwork, I immediately thought of my SIL&#39;s pristeen home. Her<br/>
  children&#39;s artwork is in clear frames on the fridge door. That&#39;s about the<br/>
  only public sign that three boys actually live in that house!<br/>
<br/>
  Whenever something like that has come up I usually say something like,<br/>
  &quot;Thank goodness I don&#39;t have a thousand dollar paint job! We buy cheap<br/>
  or used furniture and make everything washable. Otherwise, I couldn&#39;t take<br/>
  the stress.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  By the way, I still have about 10 handprints on one wall that my 3 year old<br/>
  (now 11 yo) daughter made with a rainbow stamp pad. On another wall, we<br/>
  still have red streamer decorations from my son&#39;s birthday party last<br/>
  year. Sitting on the TV are some coiled pots that he made in an art class<br/>
  several years ago. My house isn&#39;t a place to display things. It&#39;s a place<br/>
  to live!<br/>

  &gt; My question was less about this particular instance than it was asking<br/>
  &gt; in general - when do I speak out? How can I do so without alienating<br/>
  &gt; people - or do I need to worry about that? I know that some<br/>
  &gt; unschooling advocates are VERY outspoken - but I think they turn quite<br/>
  &gt; a few people off. I want to introduce the idea that there&#39;s a<br/>
  &gt; different way to see things, and advocate for the children, but dont&#39;<br/>
  &gt; want to push people away. Here&#39;s another example:<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; I was at a party recently, and a couple was telling the story of<br/>
  &gt; coming home earlier that day and finding their youngest daughter had<br/>
  &gt; taped up every one of her drawings. The dad said, &quot;I thought we had<br/>
  &gt; the tape put away!&quot; and the mom said, &quot;I guess she can reach that<br/>
  &gt; drawer now!&quot; I said, &quot;Wow - that&#39;s fantastic! She was doing an art<br/>
  &gt; show! Maybe you could invite some of her friends over?&quot; And the dad<br/>
  &gt; said, &quot;Oh, no. I just painted that room! I&#39;m not going to have a<br/>
  &gt; thousand dollar paint job ruined!&quot; His attitude was - of course, we<br/>
  &gt; can&#39;t have these drawings on the wall!<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; Of course, now, after some time, I can see I could have suggested a<br/>
  &gt; win/win - picking a couple to frame & put up, finding something other<br/>
  &gt; than tape to put them up with so it doesn&#39;t damage the wall, etc. But<br/>
  &gt; at the time, I was silent, because what I *wanted* to say was &quot;So your<br/>
  &gt; wall is more important than your daughter&#39;s creativity?&quot; Which I knew<br/>
  &gt; was contentious. His wife picked up on my attitude - that it was<br/>
  &gt; absolutely OK to decorate your home with kids&#39; artwork - and she was<br/>
  &gt; saying things like &quot;It&#39;s OK&quot; to her husband. I get tongue-tied in<br/>
  &gt; situations like that, because I do want to advocate for the child,<br/>
  &gt; whom it *seems like* doesn&#39;t have a voice, and I want to introduce a<br/>
  &gt; different way to look at things. A few other couples there were<br/>
  &gt; responding in a mainstream way - oh, yeah, you have to keep tape away<br/>
  &gt; from little ones!, etc.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; Writing this out just helped me see that I *don&#39;t know* what goes on<br/>
  &gt; in their homes, these people weren&#39;t close friends, I know them from<br/>
  &gt; the neighborhood farmer&#39;s market. I don&#39;t want to come across as &quot;all<br/>
  &gt; knowing&quot; or superior - even though I apparently have that judgment in<br/>
  &gt; me somewhere, unfortunately!<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; Thanks for helping me untangle all this - all thoughts appreciated!<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve gone through the phase of &quot;Leave that alone!&quot; to &quot;that looks<br/>
fun!&quot;. It takes a lot of self-examination that mainstream parents may<br/>
not be ready for. I remember being resistant to it before unschooling.<br/>
No magic bullet for it, just an individual process...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-347450440">I guess, for me it has to do w/how close I am to the family or  <br/>
child.  I think at first, RU seemed like something HAD tell  <br/>
everybody.  Now that it&#39;s a part of the fabric of our life, it seems  <br/>
that along with that is an acceptance that I don&#39;t know what goes on  <br/>
in someone else&#39;s mind.  I really don&#39;t know what they can do.  If  <br/>
there&#39;s an opening, like a wondering on the parents part how to deal  <br/>
w/ something, I&#39;m right there.<br/>
<br/>
My brother wanted his 7 yo dd to play the piano for us and she didn&#39;t  <br/>
want to right then.  I said oh she didn&#39;t have to if she didn&#39;t want  <br/>
to.  He insisted. I took him aside and said something about playing  <br/>
the piano is a joyful thing and hopefully it would continue to be but  <br/>
if he MADE her it probably wouldn&#39;t be and would have the opposite  <br/>
effect.  He said he&#39;d think about it for the future but he asked her  <br/>
already so she had to.  Sigh<br/>
<br/>
At other times when I&#39;m not close to the person, I don&#39;t say  <br/>
anything.  If the child is there I might make a commiserating tone.<br/>
<br/>
After we leave one of those situations and if Asher&#39;s witnessed it,  <br/>
we might talk about it.  I might say, it sounded as though it would  <br/>
have been hard for the parents to let the kids do whatever it was.  <br/>
Sometimes that ends up being a cool discussion about how others are,  <br/>
without a lot of judgement but still saying it&#39;s too bad for the  <br/>
kids.  OK, so that&#39;s judgement but it&#39;s the holding of 2 different  <br/>
things.  One is what a person can manage in their life and the other  <br/>
is commiseration w/ the child.<br/>
<br/>
My space bar is hardly working today and this is too hard to type.   <br/>
I&#39;d say more but I have to go back and punch the space bar over and  <br/>
over between the words.  Aaack.<br/>
