I still sometimes struggle with the same issues you are facing, and I felt<br/>
Kelly whip my hands with the ruler as well! :-)  I am a true type A person,<br/>
always with a list, structure, schedule, etc.  I had to truly sit down and<br/>
think�.do I want to teach my children, or do I want to watch them learn?  I<br/>
decided I love being their mom, and I did not want to be their teacher.  I<br/>
wanted to be the mom that took them to the museum and pointed out the facts<br/>
and articles.  I wanted to be the one to record Emergency Vets for my 10<br/>
year old who has her heart set on being a Vet.  I also record Planet Earth<br/>
so when she is interested, she can learn about the earth, and several other<br/>
�educational� shows.  She lets me know when she wants to watch one.  (We<br/>
have a DVR and she will scroll through and see what all is recorded) She<br/>
talked with our Vet and the Vet said to make sure she took all the math<br/>
classes she could, so she picked out some math CD�s (half price) at Staples<br/>
and she will occasionally ask to work on it.  <br/>
<br/>
For my 6 year old; she watches Noggin all day with her 2 year old sister.<br/>
And has a Lepster L-max that she will not put down.  We finally had to get<br/>
re-chargeable batteries for it she uses it so much.    My mom gave me a lot<br/>
of grief about leaving the TV on all day, until she realized my 18 month<br/>
year old could count to 10 without missing a number!  They love Noggin and<br/>
can even speak some Spanish they have learned from Dora and Diego.  I have<br/>
flash cards with colors and a shape on them that I leave in my 2 year old�s<br/>
reach.  About twice a week, she will bring them to me and tell me she wants<br/>
to do rectangles.  I never make her do anything.  <br/>
<br/>
My 6 year old can only read a few words, and writes her numbers and letters<br/>
backwards.  So what?  So did my 10 year old, who did not learn how to read<br/>
until the end of 1st grade.  When I pulled her from public school, she was<br/>
in the �gifted� class due to her test results, and made straight A�s and the<br/>
occasional B.  All her friends were dreading going to school, their moms<br/>
where having to buy the �in� clothes (can we say $$$$?) and what are my kids<br/>
doing the first day of school?  They are going to Jumpzone (a local indoor<br/>
play ground filled with inflatable slides) after my oldest daughter does her<br/>
volunteer work at our church to socialize with several other homeschooled<br/>
kids.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I wish you the best of luck; I read every book I could get my hands on, and<br/>
every article on the web I had time for. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
What a wonderful feeling it is!<br/>

You know, sometimes we know and believe but we forget. I think that is what<br/>
has happened to me. As I have pondered responses that I have received from<br/>
my different groups, I think to myself that I need to get a bit more<br/>
simplicity in my life. I decided to homeschool him the first year that we<br/>
started this learning at home thing. It was after the utter failure of my<br/>
schoolish approach. But my life was way more simple and so I could see that<br/>
he was learning.<br/>
<br/>
I still stand true that I do reside in insecurity. What I gained for your<br/>
words, Kelly, is to not scapegoat an take responsibility for what is really<br/>
going on. The truth is that I fear that I will fail at unschooling. I am<br/>
also clear that I fear having fingers point at me saying that I failed in<br/>
some way. All of this coupled with my busy-ness makes me want to do more<br/>
structured things so that I can have a peace of mind that we are at least<br/>
doing something.<br/>
<br/>
So now I am off to ponder and determine how to integrate more simplicity so<br/>
that I CAN see that my children are learning.<br/>
<br/>
Peace and thanks again<br/>

Thanks so much for your encouraging words.  It is hearing about other <br/>
unschoolers that helps me to continue to move more deeply into and <br/>
maintain my trust in unschooling.  What you are getting out of <br/>
unschooling accurately reflects what I have gotten from and seek to <br/>
get from it.<br/>
<br/>
I truly appreciate you taking the time to write to me because it has <br/>
made a difference for me.<br/>
<br/>
much peace and love<br/>
Tyra</div>
