<div id="ygrps-yiv-1564398774">***where do carrots come<br/>
from (they&#39;re almost 4 and 6.5). My DD remembered DH&#39;s garden from<br/>
the last few years and piped up, &quot;you put seeds in the ground&quot;.***<br/>
<br/>
And all the cultivated varieties of carrots came from wild carrots.  Wild <br/>
carrots don&#39;t taste very good and are only edible (if you can even call it <br/>
that)  when they&#39;re very young and tender.   The beautiful Queen Anne&#39;s Lace <br/>
is the flower of the wild carrot.  If you go into your local florists shop <br/>
you might find it there.  I have a gangly bunch of it shedding tiny petals <br/>
on my table right now.<br/>
<br/>
Carrots won&#39;t overwinter in my part of the country but I know some gardeners <br/>
who dig the roots and store them just so they can have their own seeds.  At <br/>
a buck fifty nine for a pack of organic seeds at the whole foods market, <br/>
I&#39;ll save my limited basement storage space for David&#39;s (dh) home brew. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We had a lot of fun when Dylan was little, crossing Petunia&#39;s to make new <br/>
colors.  And we&#39;ve had odd, crossed squashes volunteer on the compost heap.<br/>
Cucumber varieties cross readily and Tulip cultivars cross easily with wild <br/>
Tulips.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t know that Deb!  I love Queen Anne&#39;s Lace (even if it DOES shed <br/>
tiny little petals all over the place!)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We had a pumpkin vine growing in a ravine in our yard where I think an <br/>
old pumpkin ended up the year before, but I never saw any pumpkins (it <br/>
was also hard to get at).<br/>
<br/>
I still remember the taste of carrots from my grandmother&#39;s garden, <br/>
freshly picked and washed off under the hose!  Danielle loves to eat <br/>
cherry tomatoes and green beans right out of the garden.  Oh, and I&#39;ll <br/>
never forget her excitement when she found her first tomato hornworm a <br/>
few years back! (they ARE kinda cute!)<br/>
