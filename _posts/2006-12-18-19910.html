<div id="ygrps-yiv-1020919191">Help<br/>
I have a 2 and half yr old dd. She is my second dd. She seems to <br/>
just refuse to want to use the potty. She did a bit when we were in <br/>
Italy(we live there part of the year in the summers). Then we got <br/>
back to Florida and is not interested. I never tried to train her..I <br/>
just showed her the little seat and let her watch us. She would tell <br/>
me...&quot;poopies&quot; and would go into the bathroom..esp at night before <br/>
bed while in Italy. Now I explain to her how it might feel better to <br/>
go on the potty, as I am cleaning her up from her diaper..and she <br/>
says ...&quot;no mamma..I like the diaper&quot;. SO my question is..how does <br/>
one &quot;unschool&quot; on this one? I did train my first and aside from over <br/>
night..she was easy. I did use rewards with her of little M&M&#39;s. It <br/>
did work well. Now I am letting my second just learn for <br/>
herself..yet she does not seem to want to. If I remover her <br/>
diaper..she just does it wherever she pleases adn never near the <br/>
bathroom. I am tired of cleaning the couch, carpets, etc. I am <br/>
thinking of reverting to &quot;teach&quot; and reward her...<br/>
ANY ADVICE????<br/>
Thanks<br/>

Well, it looks like your daughter has already told you. :) She likes <br/>
the diaper right now. It&#39;s not forever. I found that when I gave my <br/>
son a choice--an real choice--it was easy. I trusted that he would <br/>
learn on his own time. When I could tell he needed to go (and he was <br/>
naked), I&#39;d ask, &quot;Do you want to go in the potty or in a diaper?&quot; And <br/>
he&#39;d say, &quot;in my diaper.&quot; That was my answer. He guided me on how he <br/>
wanted to do it. I just helped with the diaper or with wiping him up. <br/>
It&#39;s up to us to let go of our arbitrary timetables with potty <br/>
training.<br/>
hth, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-947340823">I did not potty train my oldest son. It wasn&#39;t my plan to not train him I<br/>
just didn&#39;t get around to it .. I bought the potty chair and right away he<br/>
took it out of the bathroom and put it in front of the TV and watched<br/>
cartoons on it. One day I came into the living room to find him sitting on<br/>
the potty naked from the waste down and going in it. From then on he used<br/>
the potty. He didn&#39;t have accidents and went from diapers to regular<br/>
underwear.<br/>
<br/>
I did try to train my daughter and a lot of it went like you are describing<br/>
.. sometimes she would be happy to use the potty but other times she wanted<br/>
her diaper. For a short period I was asking if she needed to use the potty a<br/>
lot, she&#39;d always say no and took to hiding in the hallway to poop. As soon<br/>
as I realized she was hiding to do her business I stopped the training.<br/>
<br/>
With my 3rd child I went back to just leaving the potty chair out for him<br/>
and he used it when he was ready and aside from some video game induced<br/>
accidents he really didn&#39;t have any accidents either. He did poop on the<br/>
floor next to the potty chair a couple times, though.<br/>
<br/>
In my experience the two kids I did not train went from diapers to undies<br/>
very smoothly. My daughter didn&#39;t like the training and I think she held on<br/>
to her diapers longer because I tried to get her out of them. I think she<br/>
was about 3 1/2 before she was completely out of diapers. The boys were both<br/>
right about 3 when they started using the potty by choice.<br/>
<br/>
My advice would be to do nothing. Use the diapers for now and when she<br/>
doesn&#39;t want the diapers anymore she&#39;ll let you know.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1612548472">Since we&#39;re doing this now too I thought I&#39;d throw out some<br/>
thoughts... My son started refusing diapers though so totally<br/>
different scenario. But still..<br/>
<br/>
When she&#39;s naked, does she have any particular patterns to where she<br/>
goes? My son did this for a while and there were several &quot;repeat&quot;<br/>
places that he would choose. I don&#39;t know what kind of diapers you<br/>
use, but I have several cloth prefolds that I just started leaving on<br/>
the floor around the areas that he was using. I also have a small<br/>
potty that I would leave nearby where he was going. He didn&#39;t use<br/>
that, but he did start squatting over the diapers. Then for a while he<br/>
would actually take a diaper off the table to squat over.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually (after some much sought after advice :) I got yet another<br/>
little potty that was more comfortable (squashy seat) and he enjoys<br/>
that one for some reason. I don&#39;t know quite what made him decide to<br/>
use it, but he did.<br/>
<br/>
Does your daughter help you clean up the &quot;accidents&quot; at all? My DS did<br/>
(his own choice, I didn&#39;t make him) -- he loves waving byebye to poop<br/>
and pee. Last thought -- my DS also loves that once upon a potty book.<br/>
It cracks him up to see poop in the potty.<br/>
<br/>
HTH!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1107797550">I, too, am currently in this situation so I don&#39;t really have an<br/>
answer but I do sympathize. My DD is 32 months old. About 2 months<br/>
ago, I introduced her to the toilet and she would sit on it while I<br/>
read her stories but nothing really happened. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve also read potty training books to try to get the idea across.<br/>
The best 2 for her were Toilet Learning (if I have that right -- it&#39;s<br/>
got cheesy 1970s drawings but it does lay things out very well) and<br/>
Princess and the Potty. The latter one should have given me a hint of<br/>
where things were going to go since it resonated with her. It&#39;s about<br/>
a girl old enough to use the potty but she just does not choose to!<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s pretty much where we are. After a few weeks, she started<br/>
balking at sitting on the toilet so I backed off of that. But I<br/>
decided the only way to make some progress was to put her in underwear<br/>
and let her learn that way. For her, that seemed to be the right<br/>
thing. She already seemed to have some control and that has helped her.<br/>
<br/>
Now, she still won&#39;t use the toilet. She waits until she has a diaper<br/>
on for nap time or bed time. Or she&#39;ll have an accident, which she<br/>
really has not had many of once we were past the first week. As of<br/>
yesterday I think she made a step forward. She told me she needed a<br/>
diaper instead of having an accident. My pediatrician told me he<br/>
considers kids potty trained when they demonstrate the control to hold<br/>
 it until they are on the toilet or have the diaper. So it&#39;s not so<br/>
much where they put it but that they can control it. Eventually it<br/>
will cross her mind to use the toilet instead so the actual transition<br/>
will seem easy.<br/>
<br/>
The advice I&#39;ve gotten has been essentially bribing her. Either by<br/>
rewards for going, which would not work for her, or by luring her to<br/>
the potty with the promise of some really pretty panties, which might<br/>
work with her. But I&#39;m not quite ready to push her that way at this<br/>
time. I think I&#39;ll just wait a while longer and see what she does.</div>
