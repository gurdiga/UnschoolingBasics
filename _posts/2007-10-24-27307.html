<div id="ygrps-yiv-568195282">Someone here had posted about feed a dog a raw diet a couple weeks ago, <br/>
I think. I wondered if you (or someone else with dog knowledge) could <br/>
help me with this...<br/>
 I&#39;m looking for information about good websites that will tell how to <br/>
transition a puppy to raw/homemade food, and recipes to make the food, <br/>
and amounts to feed a puppy.  <br/>
We just got a new puppy, and I&#39;m wanting to have him on as healthy as <br/>
diet as possible, and thought someone might know of a good site.  <br/>
TIA,<br/>
Ria</div>

It&#39;s been years since I switched our two basenjis over to a raw diet so I can&#39;t track down the sites that were the most useful to me at the time, but one book I found invaluable (straightforward, no nonsense, easy to follow) was &quot;Switching to Raw&quot; by Sue Johnson.<br/>

<br/>
There are also a number of Yahoo groups out there so you may want to check on those as well.  They are a great resource if you have questions, run into problems, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun with your new pup!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-385948294">I&#39;ve been raw feeding for 8 yrs.  Just feed the pup as close to whole prey<br/>
as you can.  Many yahoo groups for raw feeding too.  Feel free to ask<br/>
questions though.  And good for you for not feeding crap in a bag to your<br/>
dog!<br/>
