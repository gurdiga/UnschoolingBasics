 </span></blockquote>The fact that there is such an idiotic law (if there<br/>
is) or the fact that CPS can frown on children of<br/>
opposite sex sharing a room. It is not the govt&#39;s<br/>
business to decide who can and cannot share a room. <br/>
<br/>
I can understand the guideline for foster care because<br/>
there you&#39;re dealing with kids who did not grow up<br/>
together.<br/>
<br/>
I have kids of opposite sex who share a room, in a<br/>
manner of speaking. Their clothes are in the same<br/>
closet and their books are on the same bookshelf. But<br/>
both of them actually sleep in our room. I&#39;m sure at<br/>
least a few social workers will frown on that too. <br/>
<br/>
I grew up in India where most people have only one or<br/>
two bedrooms. Siblings of opposite sex sleeping in the<br/>
same room is not at all unusual. Growing up, we viewed<br/>
the rooms as places to keep things and the sleeping<br/>
arrangements were fluid. So the rooms were never<br/>
identified as kid&#39;s room or parents&#39;s room.<br/>

<br/>
Either way, it&#39;s not a law not even within the guidelines of social<br/>
services.  <br/>

Yes,  angry that anyone would view it as wrong bothers me. People (not<br/>

sinful  thing when there is nothing dirty or wrong to begin with.<br/>
People in america want to sexualize everything, but go somewhere where the  <br/>
human body isn&#39;t taboo or a place where wine is served at every meal to <br/>
everyone  eating that meal, and you go to a place where they don&#39;t have a problem <br/>
with  self image and alcoholism, because such an importance isn&#39;t placed on  <br/>
them.  Teenage pregnancy isn&#39;t a problem because girls and boys are hidden  from <br/>
it from the day they are born.  They don&#39;t have the desire to binge  drink when <br/>
they are  away from their parents because alcohol is  acceptable.  Now I&#39;m <br/>
not saying that parents should let their 13 year olds  get drunk.  That&#39;s not my <br/>
point.  I&#39;m just tired of all of the  censorship and how many things are <br/>
&quot;bad&quot; here today.<br/>
