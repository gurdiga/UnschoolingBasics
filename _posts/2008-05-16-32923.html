<div id="ygrps-yiv-24019145">All...I am wondering what the benefits would be, if there are any, of  <br/>
looking into a formal diagnosis. My son, who is 5.5 years old I am sure, or I  WAS <br/>
sure that he has sensory issues, as in SPD. Now, however, for various  reasons, <br/>
I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s Asberger&#39;s. I&#39;m wondering - with me attempting all RU  with <br/>
him - is there a benefit to getting a diagnosis? Right now, the only one  *I* <br/>
can think of is for his Papa. My DH comes from a place in which such things  <br/>
like SPD, Depression and PMDD (all things we face in this home) are things <br/>
that  one needs to manage and deal with and use will power and pull yourself up <br/>
by  your bootstraps kinda stuff. Not that&#39;s he&#39;s not a loving Papa - he is - <br/>
but  he&#39;s rather closed to a lot of this, though moving forward well over time. <br/>

So those of you with kids or with experience in these types oif things -  <br/>
pros/cons re a formal diagnosis? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1478392876">I have a son whom I&#39;m absolutely positive would have been given a<br/>
multitude of diagnosis&#39;.  SPD being one of them.  For a very long time<br/>
I  wavered back and forth on having him evaluated.  Usually, when I<br/>
was thinking about evaluations we were going through a particularly<br/>
rough patch, with me not knowing what in the world to do to &quot;solve his<br/>
problem&quot;.  What I realized was that I was ACTUALLY trying to solve MY<br/>
problem!  <br/>
<br/>
I personally think labels/diagnosis can be quite limiting sometimes. <br/>
A child can certainly feel a lot of negative stigma attached to their<br/>
given title. <br/>
<br/>
I think it would be important to ask yourself:<br/>
<br/>
WHO with the evaluation/diagnosis help?  You?  or your child?<br/>
<br/>
What needs does your child have that you cannot meet without a &quot;proper<br/>
diagnosis&quot;.  My son has MANY needs.  But through unschooling and<br/>
mindful parenting we&#39;ve been able to uncover his specific needs.  A<br/>
diagnosis can put a child into a category leaving out some needs and<br/>
adding to ones that aren&#39;t there.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And very importantly, remember this:  many childhood diagnosis would<br/>
not exist if it weren&#39;t for school and the habit of comparing children<br/>
to each other. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-882375069">It really depends - IF a diagnosis will provide access to something <br/>
that your child is needing (by their own needs, not what you want <br/>
them to do) that you absolutely can not get any other way, then it <br/>
MAY be worth it. One of the hard things, though, is using the <br/>
diagnosis ONLY for that and ignoring it the rest of the time. For <br/>
example, the difference between &quot;He&#39;s autistic&quot; and &quot;He&#39;s Jimmy, he <br/>
has some challenges that put his behavior on the autism spectrum&quot; <br/>
Notice the difference? One classifies Jimmy as a diagnosis, the other <br/>
sees Jimmy as himself and these are challenges we&#39;re working on <br/>
helping him navigate. Sometimes a diagnosis can be freeing but mostly <br/>
it tends to pigeonhole. Not on the same level really, but it was <br/>
helpful for me to read materials on spirited/explosive kids - I read <br/>
the material, absorbed the parts of it that made sense for us to <br/>
incorporate in understanding DS, then left the &#39;labels&#39; off and just <br/>
kept the tools that were helpful(and in the process gleaned info that <br/>
applies to DH as well - he thought it was cool to find out about it, <br/>
and it also helped to understand that it wasn&#39;t that DS was willfully <br/>
pestering DH but rather it was their *similarities* that struck <br/>
sparks and made certain situations more difficult between the two of <br/>
them than it was with me and either of them).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-693369470">I think that, as others have mentioned, a diagnosis is most &quot;helpful&quot; for a school setting, but if your spouse is having a hard time understanding or dealing with your son&#39;s behaviors, it might help.Â  It made a big difference for my husband to see that our sons&#39; behaviors and meltdowns were not because of my parenting (I am a stay-at-home mom and he works a lot to keep it that way) and a lack of discipline, but a &quot;real&quot; issue that is somewhat out of your control.Â  I do agree, however, that a diagnosis can be frustrating and can sometimes cause parents to unconsciously limit what they think the child can do.Â  But that is something that you will have to figure out for yourself -- remember to trust yourself and your instincts about what is right for your child and your family.Â  Good juck.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Rather than thinking about it in terms of &quot;pro&quot; or &quot;anti&quot;, I like to<br/>
think about it in terms of &quot;what is most helpful&quot;. That will vary from<br/>
family to family and child to child. A diagnoses would not help my<br/>
child in any way, shape or form. I&#39;ve done all the research and know<br/>
in my heart exactly what they&#39;d want to slap on him. I know what<br/>
supports my child and I know what isn&#39;t helpful. I&#39;ve had a<br/>
psychologist concur with my own gut feelings about it, after doing an<br/>
intake for Neural feedback.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, the point is that in an unschooling setting there may be a<br/>
time and place for diagnoses. It certainly isn&#39;t necessary though. I<br/>
do think that reading and learning about &quot;difference&quot; (I don&#39;t see<br/>
them as a &quot;disability&quot; that&#39;s where we especially have a difference of<br/>
opinion) might help some parents like it helped me. I wanted to<br/>
understand. Beyond that, I support him for where he is right now, and<br/>
a diagnoses won&#39;t help me do that.<br/>
<br/>
I found this part a bit perplexing at  your blog: &quot;and the fact that<br/>
he thinks about things a little bit differently, so we&#39;re helping him<br/>
to learn to think better.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The support I give my child doesn&#39;t help him &quot;think better&quot; (what is<br/>
&quot;better&quot; anyway? Maybe he thinks just fine for HIM) it does help him<br/>
COPE better to have the support and nurture he needs. But we&#39;re not<br/>
trying to change the way he thinks. Only time will do that. Time and<br/>
nurture and meeting his needs will enable him to gather tools to cope<br/>
with this world in his own way, thinking about it in only the way that<br/>
he can.<br/>

<br/>
I understand where you&#39;re coming from; and if that&#39;s what it *takes*, <br/>
then fine. But did you need a diagnosis for that? Wasn&#39;t it obvious <br/>
that he thought differently?<br/>
<br/>
Is that not true of every single person on the planet? No two people&#39;s <br/>
brains function in the same way. I think a lot of parents assume their <br/>
kids will &quot;think&quot; like them/act like them/BE like them. But they aren&#39;t <br/>
little &quot;us&#39;s&quot;---they are completely and amazingly NOT &quot;us&#39;s&quot;. (that&#39;s <br/>
hard to figure out: us&#39;s? uses? usses? &lt;g&gt; grammatically, it would be <br/>
we&#39;s or wees &lt;g&gt; Making up plural words here. &lt;BWG&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
If we look at our children as different, from the beginning...and <br/>
forever, we can understand them *all* better and work on finding a way <br/>
through with a better attitude.<br/>
<br/>
I mean: it&#39;s *not* just aspie/autistic kids that should get this gift! <br/>
All children have brains that function in different ways, and certainly <br/>
not all need diagnoses!<br/>
<br/>
It still boils down to it&#39;s being about *you* and not the kid. If we <br/>
can accept him How He Is, we don&#39;t need to label *ourselves* as &quot;mother <br/>
of an aspie&quot;---we can just be mother of a great kid.<br/>
<br/>
My biggest issue with the aspie/autistic stuff is how much is being <br/>
tried to FIX these kids. They are not broken. They just Are Who They <br/>
Are. We can choose to work WITH them or we can choose to try to FIX <br/>
them. Working WITH them will have such sweeter benefits!<br/>

<br/>
I agree with all of this. I have one child who was diagnosed with <br/>
ADHD while he was in school. Having that diagnosis did not help him <br/>
in any way be more successful in school or out. All it did was give <br/>
people even more fuel for pressuring me to medicate him. <br/>
<br/>
When my middle child was 3 the pediatrician suggested he had SID/SPD <br/>
and referred us to OT. I declined. I didn&#39;t need a diagnosis to know <br/>
how my child was or how to respond to him. There&#39;s nothing that he <br/>
does that interferes with his life so much that he needs <br/>
intervention. If it ever becomes a problem for him and he decides he <br/>
needs extra help, then we can look into getting a diagnosis and that <br/>
extra help. For now, though, he&#39;s fine with it all so I&#39;m fine with <br/>
it all.<br/>

Not on  the same level really, but it was <br/>
helpful for me to read materials on  spirited/explosive kids - I read <br/>
the material, absorbed the parts of it  that made sense for us to <br/>
incorporate in understanding DS, then left the  &#39;labels&#39; off and just <br/>
kept the tools that were helpful(and in the process  gleaned info that <br/>
applies to DH as well - he thought it was cool to find  out about it, <br/>
and it also helped to understand that  it wasn&#39;t that DS was willfully <br/>
pestering DH but rather it  was their *similarities* that struck <br/>
sparks and made certain situations  more difficult between the two of <br/>
them than it was with me and either of  them).<br/>

<br/>
Deb, I bolded and enlarged that part that makes me want to do this. The  <br/>
other parts, I totally agree. I don&#39;t want to pigeonhole him in the LEAST. I&#39;d  <br/>
like to think that I could use a diagnosis as a tool - def. NOT who Julian is,  <br/>
but rather a part of him that helps me learn about his creative behaviors :) I <br/>
 love all of him - maybe it would help with some of the more challenging  <br/>
behaviors - to understand them more, kwim? And that may help me to be more  <br/>
patient and creative too, as far as the RU and CL lifestyle goes...<br/>
 <br/>
Db, thanks for your input and thoughts. It&#39;s helping me a lot to listen to  <br/>
others. <br/>
 <br/>

It made  a big difference for my husband to see that our sons&#39; behaviors and <br/>
meltdowns  were not because of my parenting (I am a stay-at-home mom and he <br/>
works a lot  to keep it that way) and a lack of discipline, but a &quot;real&quot; issue <br/>
that is  somewhat out of your control.  I do agree, however, that a diagnosis <br/>
can  be frustrating and can sometimes cause parents to unconsciously limit what <br/>
 they think the child can do. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hi, Jamie. Thank you, too! I see I keep copying and marking the same ideas  <br/>
in the responses I&#39;ve been getting - interesting. Def. all about DH, but I know <br/>
 for me too (I just replied about that in a different note), it could help me <br/>
-  give me more tools for my tool box. In some ways, I actually see his <br/>
abilities  increasing and getting rid of limitations. Freeing - but maybe I&#39;m in a <br/>
fantasy  land, lol! <br/>
 <br/>
Jamie, thanks for your input. I appreciate all of this a lot. <br/>

My  child was SOOOOO difficult that I thought it was something the matter<br/>
with  me. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It was great to be able to say, &quot;Ok, he has trouble with  this because his<br/>

now I can work on finding a way through  it.&quot;<br/>

Cecily, thanks for the link! I&#39;m a link-freak, lol, so that&#39;s a great help  <br/>

Rather  than thinking about it in terms of &quot;pro&quot; or &quot;anti&quot;, I like to<br/>
think about  it in terms of &quot;what is most helpful&quot;. That will vary from<br/>
family to family  and child to child. A diagnoses would not help my<br/>
child in any way, shape  or form. I&#39;ve done all the research and know<br/>
in my heart exactly what  they&#39;d want to slap on him. I know what<br/>
supports my child and I know what  isn&#39;t helpful. I&#39;ve had a<br/>
psychologist concur with my own gut feelings  about it, after doing an<br/>
intake for Neural  feedback.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ren, thank you! We have a GREAT doctor that has said he backs my parenting  <br/>
&quot;110%&quot; :) He has supported unschooling, extended breastfeeding and no vaccines, <br/>
 so I don&#39;t worry about what he would say - but the diagnosticians, I do have <br/>
 concerns about. Thanks for aspect. I clearly need to ruminate on this and  <br/>
discuss it with not only Julian himself, but also with his Papa. <br/>

<h4>The Patersons</h4>
<p><small><time>18 May 2008, at  2:24am</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-372339393">&quot;I understand where you&#39;re coming from; and if that&#39;s what it *takes*, <br/>
then fine. But did you need a diagnosis for that? Wasn&#39;t it obvious <br/>
that he thought differently?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it was incredibly obvious! That&#39;s not what I needed the diagnosis for.<br/>
I needed it because I didn&#39;t understand just how his thinking was different.<br/>
Having the words &#39;autistic spectrum disorder&#39; gave me a handle to go and do<br/>
some research and find out exactly what the characteristics of ASD. For<br/>
example: he screamed a whole lot for a year or more. So I needed to know<br/>
what was behind that. Is it a characteristic of ASD that he needs to do<br/>
something with his voice, or is it that he not handling the uncertainty and<br/>
thus is expressing his anxiety? (FYI it&#39;s the anxiety).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Is that not true of every single person on the planet? No two people&#39;s <br/>
brains function in the same way. I think a lot of parents assume their <br/>
kids will &quot;think&quot; like them/act like them/BE like them. But they aren&#39;t <br/>
little &quot;us&#39;s&quot;---they are completely and amazingly NOT &quot;us&#39;s&quot;. (that&#39;s <br/>
hard to figure out: us&#39;s? uses? usses? &lt;g&gt; grammatically, it would be <br/>
we&#39;s or wees &lt;g&gt; Making up plural words here. &lt;BWG&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
If we look at our children as different, from the beginning...and <br/>
forever, we can understand them *all* better and work on finding a way <br/>
through with a better attitude.<br/>
<br/>
I mean: it&#39;s *not* just aspie/autistic kids that should get this gift! <br/>
All children have brains that function in different ways, and certainly <br/>
not all need diagnoses!<br/>
<br/>
Absolutely. No one is the same. You just have to do one of those personality<br/>
tests to see that you can quantify the obvious - In the Myers Briggs scheme<br/>
I&#39;m an INFJ - my husband is ENFP. It&#39;s helpful to us to be able to<br/>
understand each other better so that we don&#39;t fall into the easy pit of<br/>
thinking his messiness is laziness, or my organisational skills are<br/>
arrogance. My daughter is very different from me. She needs heaps more<br/>
friends around than I do. She hates dancing, whereas I would have given my<br/>
right arm to do ballet lessons (although on second thought that wouldn&#39;t<br/>
have done my ballet skills much good...)<br/>
<br/>
However, with all our differences though, there are basic similarities in<br/>
human child development. Eg. We expect every child to walk (eventually),<br/>
unless they are missing their feet or have some muscular difficulty etc. We<br/>
expect every child to use the toilet eventually - whether you start with EC<br/>
or nappies - unless they have some bladder issue etc. The things that are<br/>
missing from the development in autistic children are the things we don&#39;t<br/>
even think about like - responding to and being able to use: facial signals,<br/>
tone of voice, gestures, following  gaze to find something, following a<br/>
point. Most of the non-verbal relationship skills that babies under 18<br/>
months develop automatically, autistic kids lack. Why do they lack them?<br/>
Because for whatever reason, their brains are not connecting in normal ways.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My biggest issue with the aspie/autistic stuff is how much is being <br/>
tried to FIX these kids. They are not broken. They just Are Who They <br/>
Are. We can choose to work WITH them or we can choose to try to FIX <br/>
them. Working WITH them will have such sweeter benefits!<br/>
<br/>
There are a few things to say. Firstly, numbers of ASD children has<br/>
increased greatly in the last 20 years, such that they now say that 1 in 160<br/>
children is &#39;on the spectrum&#39;. Of course, levels of intensity vary greatly.<br/>
So someone has to ask the question: why is this? And how can we stop the<br/>
increase? <br/>
<br/>
Secondly, if you want to use the word &#39;broken&#39;, I think they are broken - in<br/>
the same way that if your kid had a problem walking at the age of 10, you<br/>
could consider something &#39;broken&#39;. &#39;Broken&#39; only refers to not being the<br/>
same as the majority - the same as what we would consider normal/usual. I&#39;m<br/>
not saying there&#39;s anything bad or wrong with being broken. Just that<br/>
whatever it is is not working as well as one would expect, given the regular<br/>
state of the world. And if you can do something about it, why wouldn&#39;t you?<br/>
Why do we do surgery on club feet and hare lips? Why do we find ways to<br/>
balance body chemistry of children with diabetes? Because &#39;fixing&#39; these<br/>
things helps the children who have them work in the way most others work and<br/>
relate to others better. <br/>
<br/>
Autism looks a little bit different because you can&#39;t see a physical<br/>
difference, and it&#39;s not life-threatening in general. But I would argue that<br/>
relationships are the key to a happy and fulfilled and joyful life. And if<br/>
someone is lacking those basic relationship skills because their brain has<br/>
not had the opportunity to get &#39;wired&#39; in that way, why wouldn&#39;t you want to<br/>
do something about it if you could? <br/>
<br/>
The limited research that has been done on autistic (mostly Aspergers)<br/>
adults (three major studies) shows that only about 10-20% are able to hold<br/>
down a regular job. Less than 10% have a friend or intimate relationship.<br/>
Less than 6% live independently. Over 80% suffer depression and other mental<br/>
health issues. It&#39;s not a great scenario for an autistic kid. But if you can<br/>
do something to help that kid live a happy and joyful and relationship<br/>
filled life, why wouldn&#39;t you?<br/>
<br/>
Thirdly, frankly, my child did need &#39;fixing&#39;. There are different ways ASD<br/>
affects people, but when my child was diagnosed at 3, he had screamed all<br/>
day every day for months. He couldn&#39;t go in or out of a doorway without<br/>
screaming. Noone could look at him without him screaming. He couldn&#39;t<br/>
understand a simple concept like &quot;we&#39;ll have that later&quot;. He couldn&#39;t answer<br/>
a question or make a simple choice without screaming. He didn&#39;t have one<br/>
child he liked or played with. He could speak, but he would only recite<br/>
scripts from TV shows. He talked about Thomas the Tank Engine all day (when<br/>
he wasn&#39;t screaming). He was visibly anxious and unhappy. He needed help -<br/>
more help than I knew how to give.<br/>
<br/>
One simple thing was changing his diet to exclude gluten and casein. Within<br/>
three weeks he was happier, brighter, more connected. It made a big<br/>
difference. Starting RDI therapy made another big difference. He still has a<br/>
long way to go to building his relationship skills, but he&#39;s well on the way<br/>
and he&#39;s absolutely gorgeous and adorable. I love him to bits. <br/>
<br/>
Another thing: I&#39;m pretty sure my older brother (now 37) has autism. He&#39;s<br/>
unable to think flexibly and gets confused in conversations. He is mildly<br/>
affected and is one of the 10% who does ok as an adult, but he&#39;s never had a<br/>
girlfriend and I know he&#39;d love to be married. He&#39;s only ever had one friend<br/>
with whom it was a real relationship of peers - every other relationship<br/>
I&#39;ve observed him in has had the other person doing all the work and &#39;being<br/>
nice&#39; to him as opposed to relating to him on the same level. I think that&#39;s<br/>
sad. I would have loved him to get the therapy my son has. It would have<br/>
made his life a lot happier and more joyful.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It still boils down to it&#39;s being about *you* and not the kid. If we <br/>
can accept him How He Is, we don&#39;t need to label *ourselves* as &quot;mother <br/>
of an aspie&quot;---we can just be mother of a great kid.<br/>
<br/>
This is something I have had a lot of trouble with, and a lot of grief<br/>
about. I&#39;ve had a lot of soul-searching to do about my ideas of &#39;perfect&#39;<br/>
and &#39;acceptable&#39;. It has been a journey for me and I&#39;m extremely grateful<br/>
for it. No matter how my boy comes out in the end, I will love him and<br/>
accept him just as I do now. But that doesn&#39;t stop me wanting to get him the<br/>
most effective help I can. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your thoughts.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I would call that different, not broken. Once you call it broken <br/>
that does mean you see it as a problem that has to be fixed. <br/>
<br/>
=============<br/>
<br/>
And if you can do something about it, why wouldn&#39;t you?<br/>

Because the child may not want anything done about it. The person <br/>
may not think there&#39;s anything &quot;wrong&quot; with them until other people <br/>
start pointing it out or reacting to it.<br/>
<br/>
===========<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Why do we do surgery on club feet and hare lips? Why do we find <br/>
 </span></blockquote>ways to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; balance body chemistry of children with diabetes? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>=============<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know about club feet but a hare lip might need to be <br/>
repaired so that a person can eat. If a person can&#39;t eat, s/he will <br/>
die. That&#39;s about survival, not getting along better with others or <br/>
fitting into society better.<br/>
<br/>
===========  <br/>
<br/>
I would argue that<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; relationships are the key to a happy and fulfilled and joyful <br/>
 </span></blockquote>life. <br/>
<br/>
=========<br/>
<br/>
Not everyone would agree with you.<br/>
<br/>
=============<br/>
<br/>
And if<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; someone is lacking those basic relationship skills because their <br/>
 </span></blockquote>brain has<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; not had the opportunity to get &#39;wired&#39; in that way, why wouldn&#39;t <br/>
 </span></blockquote>you want to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; do something about it if you could? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>===========<br/>
<br/>
Because it should be up to the person with the &quot;problem&quot; to decide <br/>
there is a problem that needs to be fixed. It&#39;s not up to someone <br/>
else to decide that for the person.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-573406688">~~Secondly, if you want to use the word &#39;broken&#39;, I think they are broken - in<br/>
the same way that if your kid had a problem walking at the age of 10, you<br/>
could consider something &#39;broken&#39;. &#39;Broken&#39; only refers to not being the<br/>
same as the majority - the same as what we would consider normal/usual.~~ <br/>
   <br/>
  This reminds me of the recent thread about &#39;rules&#39; and &#39;principles&#39; and some were using the word &#39;rules&#39; as gentle guidelines and some as RULES.  I think it&#39;s funny that sometimes we get stuck on what a word means to us in our own lives and kind of forget that that word means something different to most people and has for a long time.  &#39;Broken&#39; is one of those words I think.  I bet if there was to be poll conducted, most people when hearing the word broken, would likely picture cracked, in pieces, unsalvageable, something that needs throwing away, etc.  So when the general use of the word is to describe something in this state, I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s the best adjective to describe a child.  I actually wouldn&#39;t consider my child &#39;broken&#39; even if they couldn&#39;t walk at the age of 10.  I would surely consider it &#39;different&#39; though.  The only reason it would even be considered &#39;different&#39; is because most kids walk around 1.  Who says it wouldn&#39;t be just perfect for that child to<br/>
 walk at 10???<br/>
