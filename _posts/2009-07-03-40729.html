<div id="ygrps-yiv-1887311293">Apologies for the off topic post, I hope it is OK to do this very occasionally when something is really important to me?<br/>
<br/>
For those who are not aware, here in Australia there is a new bill <br/>
which, if Parliament passes it in its current form, will make it <br/>
illegal to have a home birth with an independent midwife in Australia <br/>
as of July next year. Please, if you agree that women should be able to<br/>
 make an informed choice about where they give birth, take a minute to <br/>
sign the petition here: <br/>
