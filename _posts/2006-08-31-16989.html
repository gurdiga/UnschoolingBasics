<div id="ygrps-yiv-837065560">Well after unschooling ourselves for the last 2 1/2 years I am<br/>
actually attending the local homeschool planning meeting tonight, I<br/>
didn&#39;t even find out until last year that they had one here closer<br/>
than the one I drive to 30 min. away in a larger town. From what I<br/>
understand they are mostly Christian school at home types but they<br/>
don&#39;t ask for a declaration of faith and from what I understand they<br/>
have a couple of ecclectic families. So I am mostly trying to make<br/>
some playdates for my son, I think he is having a hard time<br/>
understanding what is involved in making conversation. He talks and<br/>
talks and tells lots of stories but he doesn&#39;t really converse well,<br/>
he does more of a one sided talking. Both my husband and I try to<br/>
engage him conversation often so I just don&#39;t understand why he<br/>
doesn&#39;t understand the process. We are getting really frustrated with<br/>
him. He is 8 and so I am hoping this is something that he is going to<br/>
eventually outgrow. I have started a local yahoo group which has a few<br/>
members but none of them are really local so it&#39;s not like we can get<br/>
together. I also started a yahoo group for kids to connect whether it<br/>
be by email, skype talking, sharing xbox live or IM handles, etc. but<br/>
so far my son hasn&#39;t done much there either (but we keep trying!)  <br/>
  I wouldn&#39;t mind my son playing with the school at home types but<br/>
when they ask to bring out their computer games and then they get a<br/>
firm &quot;you are not here to play with that you are here to exercise or<br/>
play outdoors etc&quot;  it just throws a big wrench in things because they<br/>
are so controlling of their kids and my son would have gotten a great<br/>
kick out of playing games with them so now their all unhappy, etc.<br/>
Plus many of the kids are really mean, bullying the other kids and my<br/>
son will pretty much always tell them he doesn&#39;t think that is<br/>
appropriate and will just come back to me and rather talk to me than<br/>
play with the kids like that (who could blame him?) I think my son is<br/>
doing well in most areas of his life but making friends and holding<br/>
down a conversation are just really hard for him. I&#39;m not sure what<br/>
I&#39;m asking for perhaps some insight from some who have gone through<br/>
this, perhaps I am just venting as sometimes writing it all out makes<br/>
me feel better. Thanks for listening - Barbara</div>

particular subject that they know something about they can just go on<br/>
and on.  They think that everyone is as interested in what they are<br/>
saying as they are.  As he starts to develop friendships and starts<br/>
wanting to know about his friends&#39; lives then conversation will start<br/>
working and he will have a building block from the conversations that<br/>
you have had with him.<br/>
<br/>
And don&#39;t worry about the school-at-home types turning their noses up<br/>
at computer games.  They aren&#39;t living an unschooled life and they<br/>
don&#39;t put equal value on computer games as they do books, curriculum,<br/>
and other things that they deem &quot;more educational.&quot;   Be his advocate<br/>
if someone starts to say negative things about his computer games<br/>
rather than his going outside to &quot;play.&quot;  You could say something<br/>
like, &quot;This is what he feels like doing right now.  He&#39;s<br/>
content/happy/at peace.  Why would I want to interupt that?&quot;  Turn the<br/>
conversation your way as you can better defend your parenting<br/>
decisions than your son can :)<br/>
<br/>
You might also find that the &quot;eclectic&quot; homeschoolers are unschoolers<br/>
in disguise.  Sometimes it is a code word for unschoolers who fear<br/>
that people will not accept them if they unschool.  Seen it.  You will<br/>
find the people you like to hang out with.  You find what you search<br/>
for!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1628004651">Thanks Michelle - the meeting is over now so I&#39;m trying to relax a<br/>
bit. I was prettymuch the only family there who didn&#39;t use a<br/>
curriculum, although there was one family that stated they didn&#39;t<br/>
assign grades as they had asked us to state our children&#39;s names and<br/>
grades. There were just a few kids there and I&#39;m glad my child didn&#39;t<br/>
have to suffer through the long meeting. But I did read their<br/>
membership rules and religion or a particular curriculum isn&#39;t<br/>
mentioned so dispite the amount of Sonlight and SOS users I am<br/>
apparently not breaking their rules by joining. They&#39;re having their<br/>
first meet of the year next week for the kids to have PE so we will go<br/>
and try it, they take off for the summer. I think I just felt pretty<br/>
out of place though, I mean most of the people who have their kids in<br/>
school it&#39;s because they either don&#39;t know about homeschooling, don&#39;t<br/>
care or they have to work. But these people have already made the<br/>
choice to homeschool yet are still insisting on creating a school at<br/>
home where their students have to sit and work so many hours a day. It<br/>
is really scary to me what parents can make their kids do all in the<br/>
name of education. I really want to find a place where we fit in a<br/>
little, where my son can make a friend.Perhaps I&#39;m trying too hard.   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Many people who homeschool for religious reasons still feel a strict<br/>
disciplinarian form of education is the best route.  They might not<br/>
believe in the curriculum choices being used by the public schools and<br/>
feel that their choice (be it religious or secular) is better (for<br/>
whatever reasons) but when you look at it, it still looks a whole lot<br/>
like school.  Although there are Christian unschoolers who do unschool<br/>
for religious reasons.  :)  I met a mom at our recent curriculum and<br/>
homeschool fair that I invited to our group.  She&#39;s a friend of one of<br/>
the members.  She said, &quot;I don&#39;t think you would have me.  We school<br/>
at home and have desks and salute the flag and everything and<br/>
Wednesday is a school day.&quot;  :(<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Perhaps you need to start your own group.  I did this to find an<br/>
inclusive group for my children.  I created a yahoogroup, got it so<br/>
that one could find it with google and yahoo search engines and then<br/>
made up a tri-fold and left it at bookstores, libraries, community<br/>
centers, school supply stores, anywhere I could think of where<br/>
homeschoolers might go.  I did manage to get a group of about 20<br/>
families assembled before I moved and it even included some teens (a<br/>
concern of mine).  And while it wasn&#39;t an unschool group, it was<br/>
secular.  It&#39;s doable.<br/>
