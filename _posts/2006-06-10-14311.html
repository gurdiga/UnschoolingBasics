<div id="ygrps-yiv-832580876">I thought I&#39;d better explain the whole moderation issue, to lessen<br/>
confusion.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to post an intro. to get off moderation. We simply have<br/>
all new members set to be moderated so we can filter both SPAM and new<br/>
members that might not really be here to discuss unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a safety net, to keep the list on track, that&#39;s all. We don&#39;t<br/>
like heavily moderated lists, so we try to get people off moderation<br/>
as soon as possible.<br/>
