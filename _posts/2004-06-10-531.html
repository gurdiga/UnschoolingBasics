<div id="ygrps-yiv-183272318">I &#39;ve posted several times and have spoken often of my son <br/>
Keegan who is 5, but for those of you who haven&#39;t heard of him he is <br/>
typical highly spirited child.  He, in addition, is also sensitive to <br/>
touch meaning he doesn&#39;t like to be touched.  He can take a little <br/>
touching by me, but not by outsiders.  The other day we were talking <br/>
to our neighbors and Keegan was in the back of the truck with the <br/>
rear window open.  Now, there is a windshield wiper which he had <br/>
access to and was playing with.  It didn&#39;t bother me, but my neighbor <br/>
felt the need to tell him that he shouldn&#39;t that because it might <br/>
break.  When he started to speak to Keegan, Keegan ducked away and <br/>
when he did this the neighbor held him by the arm and didn&#39;t let go.  <br/>
Before I could say anything Keegan stood up and blew the biggest <br/>
raspberry right in his face.  The neighbor was so offended, and <br/>
probably more so when I didn&#39;t make Keegan apologize or even make a <br/>
big deal out of it. I felt and still feel that Keegan had the right <br/>
to defend himself, I mean think about Keegans point of view.  Here&#39;s <br/>
this guy who grabs him and demands for him to listen and the feeling <br/>
of his hand around his wrist probably felt like daggers.  He aslo had <br/>
a similar reaction to his martial arts teacher.  He spit and even <br/>
atempted to bite him because he grabbed and started dragging Keegan <br/>
to the middle of the floor when Keegan didn&#39;t want to participate in <br/>
a huddle.  Can you imagine a sensitive to touch kid participating in <br/>
a huddle?  <br/>
    Am I doing the right thing?  Later when all was calm I asked him <br/>
how he felt about both situations and he expressed that he didn&#39;t <br/>
like to be touched like that.  We just talked about how next time he <br/>
could try to tell them first that he doesn&#39;t like to be touched or he <br/>
could give me a look that would tell me he wants my help with it, but <br/>
I didn&#39;t tell him not to spit in people&#39;s faces.<br/>
   Just curiose about opinions you might have on the subject.  Maybe <br/>
I should have been more active and said take your hands off him, but <br/>
it all happened so quickly.<br/>

Yes, I do feel Keegan was right in defending himself when a neighbor grabs him.  As well meaning as the neighbor may have been that was stepping over the line.   It was not his business .   Sensitive to touch or not, NO one likes to be grabbed or reprimanded.   No one.   <br/>
<br/>
The martial arts instructor should know more creative ways to get a kid to join /or not than grabbing and pulling.  That is his job.  Five is very young.  Even if he was not in the circle he can hear what is being said and choose to join when ready.  <br/>
<br/>
However, Keegan will need to learn not to use biting and spitting as a defense.  He is still too young to know what else to do, but needs to learn.  I<br/>
<br/>
The reason I say this about spitting is because in &quot; this day and age of AIDS&quot; , people will use this against him.  It is ridicules for a natural kid reaction of spitting to be considered an assault but it is now.  My ds had to have an Aids test taken when he spit at an abusive teacher in ps<br/>

Well, also taking the time to explain to the agressor just what it was THEY<br/>
did wrong.  You can say something like, &quot;Oh dear, are you ok?  My son feels<br/>
very threatened in these situations and was only defending himself.  I hope<br/>
that you are ok, but you have to understand that he was very scared.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t make a big deal, be matter of fact and don&#39;t back down from defending<br/>
your son&#39;s actions.<br/>
<br/>
If someone did that to an adult, they might be up on assult charges, but<br/>
it&#39;s just assumed we can manhandle kids.<br/>

     See now that was exactly my thinking.  I was offended at the neighbor<br/>
and wished that I was quicker with a response.  I&#39;m one of those people,<br/>
unfortunately, that thinks about the things I should have said 10 minutes<br/>
after I should have said them.<br/>
    Why do people feel the need to touch him even if they know his touch<br/>
issues?  I hate that.  If I tell them about it in advance it makes the<br/>
situation that much worse.  Power issues for the adult I guess.  It<br/>
obviously irks me and that&#39;s why I thought &quot; there you get what you deserve,<br/>
a big old fat raspberry&quot;<br/>

  What? It was my understanding that you can&#39;t get aids from saliva.<br/>
anyway, I understand your point and didn&#39;t condone the spitting.  I just<br/>
couldn&#39;t bring myself at the time to reprimand him because these people know<br/>
about his touching issues.  Sometimes I think they tend to be more physical<br/>
with him when they know of his touch issues.  Like they think they can<br/>
change him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1529303315">AnnMarie... I didn&#39;t realize the neighbor was already aware of <br/>
Keegan&#39;s sensitivity. I&#39;m more peeved than I was before. <br/>
<br/>
It sounds like the same kind of thing that well-meaning people do <br/>
when they &#39;test&#39; our kids to see if we&#39;re up to grade level. My aunt <br/>
was always asking Laurie English questions because she was an <br/>
English teacher. (Laurie eventually told my aunt that she would let <br/>
her know when she had an interest in advanced grammar... she was 9 <br/>
at the time). <br/>
<br/>
I understand what you mean about thinking too late about what you <br/>
should have said. I am better at that than I used to be, but I still <br/>
have a problem with it. I used to automatically not say anything <br/>
because I didn&#39;t want others to think I was strange. I think it <br/>
became habit to hold my tongue some of the time rather than say what <br/>
I was thinking...just to avoid the conflict. <br/>
<br/>
As Laurie got older, I became more confident and I started saying <br/>
what I thought as soon as I thought it. It would have been okay in <br/>
your situation to immediately gasp and say, &quot;You KNOW he doesn&#39;t <br/>
like to be touched. How dare you!&quot; Once I got to where I would speak <br/>
out immediately when someone offended me or Laurie, Laurie grew <br/>
stronger and more verbose (and boy did she!) :-) <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I believe I KNEW what to say when something happened, but <br/>
I was afraid I&#39;d offend so I&#39;d keep quiet. I soon figured out that <br/>
the offenders needed to be offended or they&#39;d do it again. <br/>
<br/>
I guess in a way I&#39;m giving you permission (not that you need it <br/>
from me) to &quot;let &#39;em have it&quot; when they offend you. You don&#39;t owe <br/>
them a thing.<br/>
<br/>
love, Valerie <br/>

<br/>
I am often in similar situations. People have so little respect for a <br/>
2-3 yr old&#39;s space. I took Mikey to a tumbling class when he was 2 <br/>
and the teachers kept doing the same thing every class--trying <br/>
to &#39;help&#39; him on the equipment, jumping into his path to say hello <br/>
when he was running, etc. They never got the fact that they might <br/>
want to do something different. When I took him to a Gymboree <br/>
class...ah, the difference. The teachers had obviously been trained <br/>
on how to deal with his type! He went from screaming the first time <br/>
they tried to do something with them to eating out of their hands <br/>
(figuratively, that is). Of course, it cost a lot more money and is <br/>
much further from our house...<br/>
<br/>
When he screams or blows raspberries, I remind him of our standards <br/>
of behavior and ask him to use his words. I usually start by talking <br/>
to Mikey and ignoring the adult, because Mikey&#39;s so upset. Then <br/>
either he can express himself in words or I can do it or help him. At <br/>
that point, the adult hears what the issue is and sees that I treat <br/>
it as legitimate. How they respond varies. Sometimes I understand <br/>
where they are coming from; e.g., Mikey starts screaming when someone <br/>
else tries to strap him into his carseat. Well, of course he needs to <br/>
be strapped in, so sometimes the adult doesn&#39;t see the real reason <br/>
he&#39;s fussing. Once they understand it&#39;s the problem of *who* straps <br/>
him in, they usually are happy to sit back and not deal with it! Our <br/>
almost 9 yr old neighbor with VERY controling parents has had a bit <br/>
of a learning curve but is finally asking Mikey before he does <br/>
something. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Whew. Your neighbor grabbing his arm is terrible. I can understand <br/>
both of you having a strong reaction. I would probably gotten away <br/>
from the neighbor as quickly as possible before I grabbed his arm! <br/>
I&#39;d wait until I could talk calmly and tell him never to grab my <br/>
child again. It&#39;s not about Keegan&#39;s touch issues; it wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
appropriate to do to any child, even if they didn&#39;t protest!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
