<div id="ygrps-yiv-887707270">&lt;&lt;There&#39;s a great<br/>
book. It&#39;s simply called &#39;Dreads&#39; by by Francesco Mastalia, Alfonse<br/>
Pagano, and Alice Walker.&gt;&gt;<br/>
I heartily second this recommendation, even if you are not interested in <br/>
Dreads personally.<br/>
Absolutely exquisite photos and stories.<br/>
