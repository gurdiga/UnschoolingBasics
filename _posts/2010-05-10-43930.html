Isn&#39;t this fun? You come with a &#39;real life valid behavioral issue&#39; and<br/>
within a day or so you come to understand that you were right all along<br/>
though did not know how right you were in knowing it was not the behaviour<br/>
but the circumsances. You did not want to nag your kids but did not see how<br/>
to get out of nagging mode and after only a couple of posts you already saw<br/>
the &#39;real&#39; issue. Don&#39;t you just love this list?<br/>
