<div id="ygrps-yiv-498056258">It&#39;s both funny and sad that this has been hard for me to accept.  I am a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; SAHM mom not because it&#39;s all I ever wanted to be but because I know it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; the best thing for kids.  I am a raw feeder, leaving the veterinary field<br/>
&gt; because I could not longer look people in the eye and repeat the garbage<br/>
&gt; that I was taught about how kibble is the only thing dogs should eat.<br/>
&gt; Kibble is not biologically appropriate food for cats or dogs.  Whole prey is<br/>
&gt; what they should be eating.  That&#39;s what is natural and best.   I resisted<br/>
&gt; this knowledge at first because it was not what I was taught.  But then I<br/>
&gt; looked at who was teaching it and it was the pet food companies!  That is<br/>
&gt; who teaches nutrition at vet schools.  So veterinarians are not taught the<br/>
&gt; truth they are taught the propaganda.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And now this...I was so invested in the boys until they hit school age.  I<br/>
withheld vaccines because the risk wasn&#39;t acceptible to me when they were<br/>
babies.  They co-slept with us until they were sleeping through the night.<br/>
It was when I had to hand them over to the school that I became so rigid<br/>
about rules etc...and I&#39;ve been struggling with what I think are things that<br/>
aren&#39;t right to me.  But the light has come on now.  I can see it.  I just<br/>
need to parent them as I did when they were babies.  Only now I don&#39;t have<br/>
to be ever-vigilant.<br/>
<br/>
This will come in time and I don&#39;t have to abdicate parenting them to do<br/>
this well.  They are good boys not because we&#39;ve forced them to be, but<br/>
because they are good kids and despite my shortcomings I am a good parent.<br/>
I&#39;m involved and invested.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you everyone but especially Joyce and Karen for talking me through<br/>
this hard transition.  Karen Pryor calls it a &quot;prelearning temper tantrum.&quot;<br/>
She says, &quot;in humans prelearning temper tantrums often seem to take place<br/>
when long held beliefs are challenged and the subject knows deep inside that<br/>
there is some truth to the new information.  The recognition that what has<br/>
been learned is not quite true seems to lead to the furious comeback, to<br/>
excessive response, far beyond disagreement, discussion or querying that<br/>
might off hand seem more probable and appropriate.&quot;  She goes on to say,<br/>
&quot;However, I have come to regard the prelearning temper tantrum as a strong<br/>
indicator that real learning is actually finally about to take place.  If<br/>
you stand back and let it pass over, like a rainstorm, there may be rainbows<br/>
on the other side.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now to get about the business of unlearning what I&#39;ve accepted as truth but<br/>
what felt wrong all along.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>
Karen<br/>

tantrum stage. It probably feels scary, like letting go of the side  <br/>
of the pool so they give up and retreat.<br/>
