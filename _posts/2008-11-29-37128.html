<div id="ygrps-yiv-209116576">Hi. I just saw where the Hagerstown H.EA.A.R.T.S  Group is deleted and<br/>
would like to invite all folks from there to the Western MAryland<br/>
H.E..R.T.S. Group.<br/>
the link for it is:<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
H.E.A.R.T.S. stands for Homeschoolers Educationg, Assisting, and<br/>
Reaching out Through service. It is a program that encourages<br/>
homeschoolers to reach out and get involved in their community and<br/>
beyond to make a difference. It&#39;s purpose is to bring together a huge<br/>
diverse group of homeschoolers into community projects and create<br/>
public awarness.<br/>
<br/>
H.E.A.R.T.S. began in N.J. by a homeschooling mom named Michele Pulis.<br/>
It is now a national program.<br/>

area(Boonesboro,Cumberland,Fairplay, Frostburg,Hagerstown, Smithsburg,<br/>

Westernport, or any where in Western Maryland ) as well as the<br/>
outlaying areas in W.Va,(MArtinsburg, Sheperdstown, Falling<br/>
waters,Ridgely, Keyser,Wiley Ford,Romeny, etc.) and<br/>
Pa.(Centerville,Bedford,Mann&#39;s Choice,etc,). This group is where we<br/>
will be posting all activities.<br/>
