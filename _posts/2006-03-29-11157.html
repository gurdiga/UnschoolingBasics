<div id="ygrps-yiv-42405694">First let me preface this with the fact that my sister does not agree with<br/>
anything I ever do.  She doesn&#39;t respect me or my parenting style, ever<br/>
(even when I was super strict), she doesn&#39;t respect me being pagan, and<br/>
doesn&#39;t even attempt to understand any of it.  I was at her house in Tulsa,<br/>
OK yesterday and today.  I am not sure why I even attempt to do things with<br/>
her other than she *is* my sister and our boys are close in age.  Her kids<br/>
are in public school and tonz of activities (I am not sure how they ever<br/>
connect as a family).  The below all happened after she had yelled &quot;no&quot; at<br/>
Aden several times for trying to touch an UNCOVERED wall socket that was at<br/>
his eye level and had a red button on it (you know those kind that you can<br/>
reset)...needless to say I should have just gone home at that point...<br/>
 <br/>
That said, I know she doesn&#39;t understand our decision to homeschool and when<br/>
she asked, &quot;So, how do you homeschool?  What do you do?  Do you set aside<br/>
time each day to work on things?&quot; I knew she was looking to judge me and<br/>
what I do.  I am an open & honest person but know with her that she doesn&#39;t<br/>
really listen because her mind is already made up to judge me so I don&#39;t say<br/>
too much.  So my reply was, &quot;We learn by living life.  Through things he is<br/>
interested in.&quot;  She asked, &quot;How do you do homeschooling, I mean do you just<br/>
tell people you are homeschooling or what?&quot;  I told her that in Oklahoma we<br/>
are not required to notify anyone of homeschooling.  She asked, &quot;Well aren&#39;t<br/>
there tests he has to take to make sure he is learning what he is supposed<br/>
to be learning?&quot;  I said, &quot;No, no testing required.&quot;  She then asked, &quot;Do<br/>
you have a curriculum?  Does the state have one you have to go by?&quot; I said,<br/>
&quot;No, no curriculum.&quot;  She asked. &quot; Well what about grades?  He has to test<br/>
to get into college, what about that?  Is he going to college?&quot;  I said, &quot;We<br/>
don&#39;t need grades and he will go to college if he wants to go to college and<br/>
we will cross those bridges when we come to them.&quot;  She said &quot;How does he<br/>
learn Trig or Calculus?&quot; I said, &quot;Why does he have to learn that?&quot;  She<br/>
said, &quot;You know what I mean.  How does he learn history or English?&quot; (to<br/>
which I should have said, shockingly &quot;He doesn&#39;t know English?  Oh my, I am<br/>
not sure what language I speak then!&quot;  but of course I held my tongue)  I<br/>
just said something like &quot;we learn what he wants to learn.  He learns the<br/>
same way you and I do...if he wants to find something out he does and I help<br/>
him.  Same as a baby (referring to my 15 mo old), they learn things they<br/>
want to learn.&quot;   I then said, &quot;Look, I know it is not easy to understand<br/>
because it is outside the norm but it is more about trusting him, trusting<br/>
the process.&quot;  I don&#39;t remember what was said after that but she was<br/>
obviously very irritated that I was so relaxed and unmoved by the<br/>
questions...so much so that I even worried about her calling DHS on me or<br/>
something.  Then, this morning it was just her and him in the living room (I<br/>
was just in the other room and could hear everything) and she asked him &quot;So<br/>
Seth, what are you learning about?&quot; To which he offhandedly replied,<br/>
&quot;Animals.&quot;  She asked, &quot;What kind of animals?&quot; and he said, &quot;Fish.&quot; She said<br/>
&quot;Oh, like at the aquarium&quot; (we had gone to Tulsa to participate in a<br/>
homeschooling day class at the Oklahoma Aquarium on Tuesday (the whole<br/>
reason we were there in the first place) He answered &quot;yes,&quot; and it was<br/>
dropped.  She later asked me if he was in any sports.  I replied, &quot;not right<br/>
now...we start swim lessons next week which conflicts with the sports<br/>
schedules...blah blah blah&quot; she said &quot;oh so he is getting some exercise<br/>
then&quot; (Seth is on the larger side and does have some &quot;fat rolls&quot; but he is<br/>
not and never has been an unhealthy boy).  I figure she had a 2 fold reason<br/>
for asking about sports...the &quot;fat rolls&quot; and socialization...since that is<br/>
such a hard thing to get when homeschooling (yeah right).<br/>
 <br/>
So I wrote the above very long intro to ask how to reply to this email I<br/>
just got from my...well meaning....sister.  I am so mad right now I could<br/>
just send a really nasty email but I want to send one that is &quot;above that&quot;<br/>
with facts to back up what I say...basically a logical reply, not an<br/>
emotional one.  I would like it to include something about the fact that I<br/>
am not an idiot and I do know what is available and do know what I am doing<br/>
and that she should trust that I am not going to do anything to harm or<br/>
jeopardize Seth or Aden&#39;s future...I just don&#39;t know how to do it right this<br/>
minute with all this anger energy welling up inside of me.  I would<br/>
appreciate any help you all could give in how I could reply with respect,<br/>
love and peace...as that is what I would like to model in all instances.<br/>
Anyway, here is the email she sent me:<br/>
 <br/>
When we were talking I was amazed about the laws with the state on<br/>
homeschooling.  I checked into what you said to find out more about it and<br/>
found out that when the legislation passed to allow homeschooling they<br/>
didn&#39;t apply any requirements to it because the state would have to pay for<br/>
it [I have never read that this is the reason].  <br/>
They do however &quot;strongly suggest&quot;<br/>
that you use the &quot;pass skills&quot; guidelines provided by the state and document<br/>
progress.  <br/>
If for any reason a child would re-enter public or private schools most are<br/>
required to pass certain criteria to be admitted into each grade. <br/>
Students who are homeschooled will &quot;not&quot; have a highschool diploma or the<br/>
equivilant! <br/>
&quot;Some&quot; junior colleges will accept homeschooled students with remediation.  <br/>
Other junior colleges and major universities require homeschool children to<br/>
pass the SAT test in the high 20&#39;s to be admitted.<br/>
There is a good website that has the PASS SKILLS and other interesting<br/>
information:  it is www.sde.state.ok.us &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sde.state.ok.us/">http://www.sde.state.ok.us/</a>&gt; <br/>
It also looked like there were good phone numbers to call for more<br/>
information.<br/>
 <br/>
Didn&#39;t know if you knew any of this....just wanted to let you know what I<br/>
had found.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-198465095">I&#39;d just say, &quot;Thanks, I already knew that.  I do appreciate your <br/>
interest in homeschooling.  Thanks for letting us stay with you.  We had <br/>
a great time at the aquarium.&quot;  And just leave it at that.  Don&#39;t give <br/>
her an &quot;in&quot; to write you another email on the subject.<br/>
<br/>
This is akin to the &quot;bean dip&quot; response to unwanted advice.  &quot;Thanks, <br/>
and please pass the bean dip.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It sounds like your sister will never be happy with anything that you do.<br/>
So I wouldn&#39;t try to explain anything.  Even if you had a great curriculum<br/>
with a well-laid out &quot;master plan&quot; so your children could get into college,<br/>
a rigorous diet and exercise program and structured socialisation activities<br/>
she probably still wouldn&#39;t be satisfied. She sounds like she is the type<br/>
that is critical of anything that is outside of her walls.<br/>
<br/>
The best thing that you can do is to keep living your life for you and your<br/>
family.  Give her basic answers and make sure that you present yourself with<br/>
a positive attitude about whatever it is you are doing.<br/>
<br/>
I, too, have a son who is rounder in the middle than most kids his age.  He<br/>
doesn&#39;t like sports.  His idea of going outside and playing is to go sit in<br/>
the grass and watch the ants carry things or to water our new garden and<br/>
inspect the progress of our seedlings.  Sometimes he will fly an airplane or<br/>
play at some made up game.  He enjoys watching tv, playing video and<br/>
computer games, cooking and other sedentary things.  In the summer we go<br/>
to a friend&#39;s pool and swim once a week or so (the kids are marking down to<br/>
April 1st when she said we can return) and he enjoys that but I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
call him a &quot;swimmer&quot;  (it looks a whole lot like thrashing around in the<br/>
water.)  I get comments from my mother all the time (she is much like your<br/>
sister and always &quot;testing&quot; the kids to see if they know things.)<br/>
&quot;Shouldn&#39;t you limit his food?&quot; (We do to a point as he has problems with<br/>
self-regulation in many areas of his life.)  &quot;Is he going to play (fill in<br/>
name of sport here) this season?&quot;  &quot;What does his doctor say about his<br/>
weight?&quot;  (What doctor - she knows we don&#39;t go to one unless we are sick to<br/>
the point of needing one.)  It&#39;s a constant barage of questions evertime I&#39;m<br/>
over there.  So I don&#39;t go over there often.  And fortunately, she has the<br/>
common sense not to bring those things up at my house.<br/>
<br/>
If you are happy with your life, then you don&#39;t need to answer to anyone<br/>
else, even your sister.  I did, though, once tell my mom, &quot;Do you not trust<br/>
that I would do what I believe is best for my children?&quot;  It helped cut out<br/>
the nosy questions, but she just got more sly in how she went about &quot;asking&quot;<br/>
them<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-528333805">I agree with Kristie -- that approach, gee, thanks, I did know that, <br/>
and I appreciate your concern, and drop the hsing topic, is probably <br/>
the best.  Generally, if I can put a positive spin on someone&#39;s <br/>
motives -- in this case, that she truly cares about your children&#39;s <br/>
well-being -- then I do.  Makes me a happier person, and if I&#39;m <br/>
wrong, I will be happy to walk in ignorance.  <br/>
<br/>
As for some other things -- well, did she never see public schooled <br/>
kids with love handles?  I sure have!  &quot;Official&quot; PE doesn&#39;t prevent <br/>
that!<br/>
<br/>
I commend you for waiting, taking a deep breath, and taking the high <br/>
road.  It may not be easy, but you&#39;ll sleep better!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-813541761">Well, let&#39;s see.  Your first option is to ignore her email outright.  Or you could tell her you&#39;ve said all you&#39;re going to on the topic, then refuse to answer future emails on this subject.  You could suggest that you and she can discuss un/homeschooling only once she&#39;s read at least 2 (or whatever number appeals to you) books, chosen by you, about the topic.  Maybe she could read something by John Holt and Rue&#39;s book, or Sandra&#39;s book.  Then, at least you and she would be on equal footing.  Or maybe she&#39;d refuse to read anything, and you could agree to disagree and not talk about it.  <br/>
   <br/>
  My sister and I used to disagree about it, tho not strongly because we&#39;ve always had very different styles. Then, last February she pulled her kids out of school, and gradually she&#39;s landed in unschooling her daughter (her son has chosen to return to high school in the fall).  This September, she hopes to give a funshop at the Live & Learn!  So, we went from disagreeing to me bringing her over to our side! <br/>
   <br/>
  Anyway, some idea for how to reply if you decide to:<br/>
   <br/>
  &quot;If for any reason a child would re-enter public or private schools most are required to pass certain criteria to be admitted into each grade.&quot;<br/>
   <br/>
  Okay, so if they decide to attend school, they&#39;ll take a test.  Often, the same is true for kids moving from one state to another, regardless of school attendance.  This is done to better assess what incoming students might need in remediation. <br/>
   <br/>
  ****<br/>
  Students who are homeschooled will &quot;not&quot; have a highschool diploma or the equivilant!<br/>
   <br/>
  People (even non-students) who take and pass the GED will have a diploma -- and maybe they&#39;ll even be able to spell equivalent correctly!  And they could take the GED earlier than they would have graduated -- should they find a need to do so -- and be ahead of their peers.  <br/>
   <br/>
  *****<br/>
   <br/>
&quot;Some&quot; junior colleges will accept homeschooled students with remediation. <br/>
   <br/>
  Total crap -- virtually all junior (community) colleges accept anyone whose check doesn&#39;t bounce. <br/>
   <br/>
  *****<br/>
   <br/>
Other junior colleges and major universities require homeschool children to pass the SAT test in the high 20&#39;s to be admitted.<br/>
   <br/>
  Last time I checked, all universities required students to have passed either the ACT (for instate graduates) or the SAT (out of state or private schools) for admission, even with a public high school diploma.  It&#39;s a condition for all applicants, not just homeschoolers.  Otherwise, why would so many high school juniors bother to take the SAT at all?  What a stupid statement. <br/>
   <br/>
  Of course, feel free to be nicer to your sister than I have been above. <br/>

my ACT and my composite score for my SAT was in the 900&#39;s.  I used to be so<br/>
smart LOL!  So if someone only needed to score in the high 20&#39;s on the<br/>
SAT to be admitted to college I suppose they just needed to show up and be<br/>
able to fill their name out.<br/>
<br/>
When people start giving me bogus information about the &quot;future of my<br/>
children&quot; I tend to send them to the military academy FAQ page which covers<br/>
the admittance of homeschooled kids into military academies.  Here is the<br/>
link to the Naval Academy:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.usna.edu/Admissions/steps.htm">http://www.usna.edu/Admissions/steps.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
And I tell them that if my child wishes to attend the Naval Academy (we come<br/>
from multiple generations of sailors) then they will work towards these<br/>
requirements.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1690301610">Christy, <br/>
It will get easier with your family. Right now she may<br/>
be really threatened that your decision to homeschool<br/>
says that her decision to public school is stupid and<br/>
wrong, and she wants to be right. And a lot of what<br/>
she is saying is just the programming that everyone in<br/>
this country has had about how that&#39;s the only way to<br/>
raise and educate children---let the schools (experts)<br/>
do it. Your calm answers to her questions are the best<br/>
way to hanlde it right now. Do you have a homeschool<br/>
state organization that has a brochure for relatives?<br/>
My California one has one for grandparents. Maybe if<br/>
you found some brief article about reasons people<br/>
homeschool that would help her.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is almost 13. I pulled her out of PS 3<br/>
weeks into fifth grade. We never did baby talk. I<br/>
never rode around in the car with music blaring---we<br/>
chatted about what we saw driving down the rode and<br/>
she learned stuff from me. We went through houses<br/>
under construction and talked about how they bould<br/>
houses. We went to the DMV at age 2 1/2 and got a<br/>
driver&#39;s brochure full of road sign because she loved<br/>
the, and she learned them all. Then we cut them out<br/>
and put them on toothpicks and cork pieces to be signs<br/>
in her Thomas train village. School was boooooring<br/>
after mom. The teachers would say &quot;Oh you can work<br/>
with her when she gets home&quot; Well, she was tired from<br/>
all that stnding in line and waiting for other people<br/>
to finish and all that school junk. We have lived a<br/>
life of revering books and knowledge, and watch tv for<br/>
the fun of history, PBS specials, technology stuff,<br/>
etc. We don&#39;t watch the junk on all the other<br/>
channels.<br/>
She never valued the popular junk and stupid parts of<br/>
American culture (like movie star/sports star<br/>
worship).<br/>
Of course she didn&#39;t fit in at PS. She is very behind<br/>
on math but advanced on other stuff. The local<br/>
community college here in California will take her<br/>
under the Category called &quot;Special Admit&quot;, and so she<br/>
is going to take &quot;Philosophy of Religion&quot;, some fancy<br/>
advanced computer class, and maybe &quot;Psychology&quot; (she<br/>
already read the children&#39;s psych textbook that she<br/>
found at a used book store. Did they ask for her<br/>
SAT/ACT? No. Did they ask for her math? No. Am I<br/>
worried? No. (Look up www.avc.edu and go to the<br/>
admissions section and you can read it for<br/>
yourself)When she needs to learn math, she will, the<br/>
motivation will be there. You don&#39;t teach a child, you<br/>
get out of the way while they learn. You provide them<br/>
with books and things and little or big field trips<br/>
about what THEY are interested in. My daughter was<br/>
great in math in kindergarten, but that stupid Saxon<br/>
math curricula and teachers that didn&#39;t want to go for<br/>
the extra work destroyed her love of it. She actually<br/>
cried for a Math Camp after kindergarten. I should<br/>
have started homeschooling now. You are giving you<br/>
child the best gift imaginable. My child has plenty of<br/>
time to learn stuff she will need to have a college<br/>
major and go to some 4 year college. I have an MBA, I<br/>
don&#39;t know any trig, and the liitle calculus I know<br/>
from &quot;Economics of the Firm&quot; in summer school went out<br/>
the window long ago. I cried and got a tutor and<br/>
passed it by the skin of my teeth. <br/>
<br/>
Many colleges really want Homeschoolers because they<br/>
are so self motivated. Look at the website for UC<br/>
Riverside (CA), and go to the link about admissions<br/>
and making a portfolio for homeschoolers. You won&#39;t<br/>
believe how easy it is. Of course I don&#39;t mean college<br/>
is easy, but if your child wants to go after being<br/>
homeschooled, they can.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m getting ticked off about you sister!<br/>
<br/>
Get a John Gatto book from the library for emotional<br/>
support. Let your sister know in your kindest voice<br/>
that she has a choice, too, and you&#39;d like her to<br/>
respect your choice. Boy, if you could homeschool<br/>
together it would be so good for the kids.<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; First let me preface this with the fact that my<br/>
&gt; sister does not agree with<br/>
&gt; anything I ever do.  She doesn&#39;t respect me or my<br/>
&gt; parenting style, ever<br/>
&gt; (even when I was super strict), she doesn&#39;t respect<br/>
&gt; me being pagan, and<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t even attempt to understand any of it.  I was<br/>
&gt; at her house in Tulsa,<br/>
&gt; OK yesterday and today.  I am not sure why I even<br/>
&gt; attempt to do things with<br/>
&gt; her other than she *is* my sister and our boys are<br/>
&gt; close in age.  Her kids<br/>
&gt; are in public school and tonz of activities (I am<br/>
&gt; not sure how they ever<br/>
&gt; connect as a family).  The below all happened after<br/>
&gt; she had yelled &quot;no&quot; at<br/>
&gt; Aden several times for trying to touch an UNCOVERED<br/>
&gt; wall socket that was at<br/>
&gt; his eye level and had a red button on it (you know<br/>
&gt; those kind that you can<br/>
&gt; reset)...needless to say I should have just gone<br/>
&gt; home at that point...<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; That said, I know she doesn&#39;t understand our<br/>
&gt; decision to homeschool and when<br/>
&gt; she asked, &quot;So, how do you homeschool?  What do you<br/>
&gt; do?  Do you set aside<br/>
&gt; time each day to work on things?&quot; I knew she was<br/>
&gt; looking to judge me and<br/>
&gt; what I do.  I am an open & honest person but know<br/>
&gt; with her that she doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; really listen because her mind is already made up to<br/>
&gt; judge me so I don&#39;t say<br/>
&gt; too much.  So my reply was, &quot;We learn by living<br/>
&gt; life.  Through things he is<br/>
&gt; interested in.&quot;  She asked, &quot;How do you do<br/>
&gt; homeschooling, I mean do you just<br/>
&gt; tell people you are homeschooling or what?&quot;  I told<br/>
&gt; her that in Oklahoma we<br/>
&gt; are not required to notify anyone of homeschooling. <br/>
&gt; She asked, &quot;Well aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; there tests he has to take to make sure he is<br/>
&gt; learning what he is supposed<br/>
&gt; to be learning?&quot;  I said, &quot;No, no testing required.&quot;<br/>
&gt;  She then asked, &quot;Do<br/>
&gt; you have a curriculum?  Does the state have one you<br/>
&gt; have to go by?&quot; I said,<br/>
&gt; &quot;No, no curriculum.&quot;  She asked. &quot; Well what about<br/>
&gt; grades?  He has to test<br/>
&gt; to get into college, what about that?  Is he going<br/>
&gt; to college?&quot;  I said, &quot;We<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t need grades and he will go to college if he<br/>
&gt; wants to go to college and<br/>
&gt; we will cross those bridges when we come to them.&quot; <br/>
&gt; She said &quot;How does he<br/>
&gt; learn Trig or Calculus?&quot; I said, &quot;Why does he have<br/>
&gt; to learn that?&quot;  She<br/>
&gt; said, &quot;You know what I mean.  How does he learn<br/>
&gt; history or English?&quot; (to<br/>
&gt; which I should have said, shockingly &quot;He doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; know English?  Oh my, I am<br/>
&gt; not sure what language I speak then!&quot;  but of course<br/>
&gt; I held my tongue)  I<br/>
&gt; just said something like &quot;we learn what he wants to<br/>
&gt; learn.  He learns the<br/>
&gt; same way you and I do...if he wants to find<br/>
&gt; something out he does and I help<br/>
&gt; him.  Same as a baby (referring to my 15 mo old),<br/>
&gt; they learn things they<br/>
&gt; want to learn.&quot;   I then said, &quot;Look, I know it is<br/>
&gt; not easy to understand<br/>
&gt; because it is outside the norm but it is more about<br/>
&gt; trusting him, trusting<br/>
&gt; the process.&quot;  I don&#39;t remember what was said after<br/>
&gt; that but she was<br/>
&gt; obviously very irritated that I was so relaxed and<br/>
&gt; unmoved by the<br/>
&gt; questions...so much so that I even worried about her<br/>
&gt; calling DHS on me or<br/>
&gt; something.  Then, this morning it was just her and<br/>
&gt; him in the living room (I<br/>
&gt; was just in the other room and could hear<br/>
&gt; everything) and she asked him &quot;So<br/>
&gt; Seth, what are you learning about?&quot; To which he<br/>
&gt; offhandedly replied,<br/>
&gt; &quot;Animals.&quot;  She asked, &quot;What kind of animals?&quot; and<br/>
&gt; he said, &quot;Fish.&quot; She said<br/>
&gt; &quot;Oh, like at the aquarium&quot; (we had gone to Tulsa to<br/>
&gt; participate in a<br/>
&gt; homeschooling day class at the Oklahoma Aquarium on<br/>
&gt; Tuesday (the whole<br/>
&gt; reason we were there in the first place) He answered<br/>
&gt; &quot;yes,&quot; and it was<br/>
&gt; dropped.  She later asked me if he was in any<br/>
&gt; sports.  I replied, &quot;not right<br/>
&gt; now...we start swim lessons next week which<br/>
&gt; conflicts with the sports<br/>
&gt; schedules...blah blah blah&quot; she said &quot;oh so he is<br/>
&gt; getting some exercise<br/>
&gt; then&quot; (Seth is on the larger side and does have some<br/>
&gt; &quot;fat rolls&quot; but he is<br/>
&gt; not and never has been an unhealthy boy).  I figure<br/>
&gt; she had a 2 fold reason<br/>
&gt; for asking about sports...the &quot;fat rolls&quot; and<br/>
&gt; socialization...since that is<br/>
&gt; such a hard thing to get when homeschooling (yeah<br/>
&gt; right).<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; So I wrote the above very long intro to ask how to<br/>
&gt; reply to this email I<br/>
&gt; just got from my...well meaning....sister.  I am so<br/>
&gt; mad right now I could<br/>
&gt; just send a really nasty email but I want to send<br/>
&gt; one that is &quot;above that&quot;<br/>
&gt; with facts to back up what I say...basically a<br/>
&gt; logical reply, not an<br/>
&gt; emotional one.  I would like it to include something<br/>
&gt; about the fact that I<br/>
&gt; am not an idiot and I do know what is available and<br/>
&gt; do know what I am doing<br/>
&gt; and that she should trust that I am not going to do<br/>
&gt; anything to harm or<br/>
&gt; jeopardize Seth or Aden&#39;s future...I just don&#39;t know<br/>
&gt; how to do it right this<br/>
&gt; minute with all this anger energy welling up inside<br/>
&gt; of me.  I would<br/>
&gt; appreciate any help you all could give in how I<br/>
&gt; could reply with respect,<br/>
&gt; love and peace...as that is what I would like to<br/>
&gt; model in all instances.<br/>
&gt; Anyway, here is the email she sent me:<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; When we were talking I was amazed about the laws<br/>
&gt; with the state on<br/>
&gt; homeschooling.  I checked into what you said to find<br/>
&gt; out more about it and<br/>
&gt; found out that when the legislation passed to allow<br/>
&gt; homeschooling they<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t apply any requirements to it because the<br/>
&gt; state would have to pay for<br/>
&gt; it [I have never read that this is the reason].  <br/>
&gt; They do however &quot;strongly suggest&quot;<br/>
&gt; that you use the &quot;pass skills&quot; guidelines provided<br/>
&gt; by the state and document<br/>
&gt; progress.  <br/>
&gt; If for any reason a child would re-enter public or<br/>
&gt; private schools most are<br/>
&gt; required to pass certain criteria to be admitted<br/>
&gt; into each grade. <br/>
&gt; Students who are homeschooled will &quot;not&quot; have a<br/>
&gt; highschool diploma or the<br/>
&gt; equivilant! <br/>
&gt; &quot;Some&quot; junior colleges will accept homeschooled<br/>
&gt; students with remediation.  <br/>
&gt; Other junior colleges and major universities require<br/>
&gt; homeschool children to<br/>
&gt; pass the SAT test in the high 20&#39;s to be admitted.<br/>
&gt; There is a good website that has the PASS SKILLS and<br/>
&gt; other interesting<br/>
&gt; information:  it is www.sde.state.ok.us<br/>
&gt; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sde.state.ok.us/">http://www.sde.state.ok.us/</a>&gt; <br/>
&gt; It also looked like there were good phone numbers to<br/>
&gt; call for more<br/>
&gt; information.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Didn&#39;t know if you knew any of this....just wanted<br/>
&gt; to let you know what I<br/>
&gt; had found.<br/>

As a fellow Oklahoman, I have to say to your sister...pblt! Sylvia  <br/>
pretty much covered everything as far as college and high school,  <br/>
most of the information from your sister was pure scare tactic,  <br/>
hoping to freak you out and get you to change your mind about  <br/>
unschooling. If you move from one district to another you get tested,  <br/>
so I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s such a big deal to get tested to get into a  <br/>
school if you&#39;ve been homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the reason that the legislation to allow homeschooling,  <br/>
there are no requirements because Oklahoma wanted to remain a state  <br/>
that facilitates homeschooling. They wanted to allow the parents to  <br/>
choose how to teach their own children.<br/>
Homeschooling parents can make their own diploma&#39;s, and it is  <br/>
legitimate. Although no college asks for a copy of a diploma, they do  <br/>
ask for a transcript. Most colleges make allowance for homeschoolers  <br/>
however, including OU, OSU, Harvard, Yale, and every single junior  <br/>
college known to man. OU&#39;s requirements are ACT of 24, and SAT of  <br/>
1000. That&#39;s it. Not even terribly high scores. I know that smaller  <br/>
universities and colleges have scores of 16 to 18 for admission.<br/>
You know, it just makes me mad for you...because she was obviously  <br/>
exaggerating the facts to try and scare you. The more experienced  <br/>
people will tell you just to smile and keep your thoughts to  <br/>
yourself, but I&#39;d be mad. I&#39;d call her on it! I&#39;d reply that most of  <br/>
that is bogus and that you don&#39;t appreciate that kind of input.<br/>
<br/>
But then you can tell what kind of sister I am, I&#39;m the oldest and no  <br/>
one argues with me ;-) Then again, i would never in my life consider  <br/>
telling friends or family that what they were doing with their child  <br/>
was wrong. I would passionately defend what I&#39;m doing, but never say  <br/>
that school was wrong because of x, y, or z.<br/>

&gt; didn&#39;t apply any requirements to it because the state would have to  <br/>
&gt; pay for<br/>
&gt; it [I have never read that this is the reason].<br/>
&gt; They do however &quot;strongly suggest&quot;<br/>
&gt; that you use the &quot;pass skills&quot; guidelines provided by the state and  <br/>
&gt; document<br/>
&gt; progress.<br/>
&gt; If for any reason a child would re-enter public or private schools  <br/>
&gt; most are<br/>
&gt; required to pass certain criteria to be admitted into each grade.<br/>
&gt; Students who are homeschooled will &quot;not&quot; have a highschool diploma  <br/>
&gt; or the<br/>
&gt; equivilant!<br/>
&gt; &quot;Some&quot; junior colleges will accept homeschooled students with  <br/>
&gt; remediation.<br/>
&gt; Other junior colleges and major universities require homeschool  <br/>
&gt; children to<br/>
&gt; pass the SAT test in the high 20&#39;s to be admitted.<br/>
&gt; There is a good website that has the PASS SKILLS and other interesting<br/>
&gt; information:  it is www.sde.state.ok.us &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sde.state.ok.us/">http://www.sde.state.ok.us/</a>&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1887258621">It sounds like from your post that your sister and you have a <br/>
strained relationship.  If you were discussing say, what is the best <br/>
way to invest money, would you automatically disagree?  Or, would <br/>
you automatically disagree on something less important such as what <br/>
is the best way to cook a turkey.  In other words, is any topic <br/>
fodder for disagreement?  Or, are their levels of disagreements?  <br/>
Where does your relationship sit, in general and where does <br/>
unschooling sit overall in this relationship?  What type of <br/>
relationship do you want to have with her?  Maybe this will help you <br/>
the next time an unschooling discussion begins.  Instead of <br/>
defending your choice to unschool, you might take the opportunity to <br/>
build the relationship you want to have with her.  If you are <br/>
distant any way, maybe a `pass the dip&#39; response is appropriate.  <br/>
You might consider this only if you are truly at peace with this.  <br/>
If you have a closer, more amiable relationship in general or want <br/>
to work toward a better relationship, then maybe working with her to <br/>
understand her fears is more appropriate.    She seems to be very <br/>
fearful of the outcome for your child.  Perhaps you can say that <br/>
directly to her.  &quot;I sense that you have some fears about the <br/>
outcome of our approach to education.  Is this right?&quot;  If you are <br/>
quiet after saying that, then she may begin to open up a bit more <br/>
with her deeper concerns.  This approach takes energy and a true <br/>
desire to understand her side.  The knee-jerk reaction to this is <br/>
that you will cut her off too soon and begin defending your <br/>
position.  I would recommend not defending your position at all, but <br/>
put the ball in her court to allow her to fully express her feelings <br/>
and concerns.  Turn yourself momentarily into a therapist of sorts.  <br/>
Then, in turn, you may express your own concerns for your child.   <br/>
You may find that you are closer in your fears and concerns than you <br/>
think.  The topic turns then from a discussion of unschooling, to <br/>
concerns about children, in general.  I&#39;m not suggesting that after <br/>
this everyone walks away agreeing, but your sister may feel that her <br/>
concerns are heard more clearly and she may be more thoughtful <br/>
before speaking out critically the next time.<br/>
<br/>
If your sister continues to be critical whenever the discussion <br/>
comes up, then you can repeat the process, but this time be honest <br/>
with her about how you feel when she is critical.  To express your <br/>
feelings clearly, you might have to take the time to be honest with <br/>
yourself and clear in your own mind what you are feeling exactly  <br/>
not always an easy task.<br/>
<br/>

Christy, I am so sorry about your sister.  It is so hard not to have  the <br/>
support of people we care about.<br/>
 <br/>
I saw what Dana wrote above, I was thinking in a similar way.  Perhaps  a <br/>
simple answer of &quot;I appreciate how much you care about my children&quot;....making  <br/>
sure it isn&#39;t sarcastic    :-)<br/>
 <br/>
So many people instinctively lash out at those going &quot;against the  tribe&quot;.  <br/>
Know in your heart that this is their issue, not yours.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1581608174">I appreciate all of the replies I have received so far (keep them coming if<br/>
you want).  I like the &quot;pass the dip&quot; reply but I feel like I have been<br/>
doing that reply all my life with her in an effort to keep the peace so this<br/>
goes much deeper than anyone can ever know.  I have always been one to let<br/>
people live as they will (as long as they aren&#39;t hurting anyone physically)<br/>
so I am the same with her.  The problem comes in that she doesn&#39;t hesitate<br/>
to openly question/judge everything I do.  A big part of me wants to reply<br/>
to this pointing that out and telling her that if she chooses not to respect<br/>
my choices as a person and mother, when I respect hers then I cant put<br/>
myself in that position any longer.  I choose to not speak to her about any<br/>
&#39;taboo subjects&quot; such as parenting, schooling, religion, sexual orientation,<br/>
or politics.  If she feels the need to talk about those topics with me then<br/>
I will have to sever the relationship.  <br/>
 <br/>
It is also really tempting to point out the false statements she put in the<br/>
email.  More to show that I am not an idiot and I do know what I am talking<br/>
about and doing...but also to say &quot;in your face!&quot;  the reason I would<br/>
probably not do that is she would see it as a challenge and find everything<br/>
she can to discredit homeschooling.  One thing I might say is to acknowledge<br/>
that there is ample ways to make ourselves &quot;right&quot; and find everything to<br/>
support our own positions.  There are always people that will agree with us<br/>
and research to support it.  it all depends on what you are looking for.  in<br/>
that respect I think anyone looking for understanding in a topic should try<br/>
to prove themselves wrong...find the research that supports the others<br/>
persons view as opposed to finding everything that agrees with your view.  I<br/>
am parenting from my heart with what resonates with me, not based on<br/>
research and statistics...though my dh would prefer that...lol  I KNOW in my<br/>
heart that this works and I am not out to prove it to anyone, nor do I have<br/>
to.  My kids are loved and supported to the fullest extent possible every<br/>
moment of every day (I am still learning and obtaining creative ways to<br/>
&quot;reprogram&quot; us out of the distance PS and strict parenting brought us).<br/>
 <br/>
Really the ONLY reasons we ever talk are 1) family activities/holiday plans<br/>
and 2) our older sons are the same age and love to spend time together<br/>
whenever possible.  She lives 2 hrs away from me and we are both busy<br/>
families so trips to see &quot;each other&quot; are few and far between.  If the kids<br/>
weren&#39;t so close I wouldn&#39;t mind severing ties and only being civil at<br/>
family functions.  <br/>
 <br/>
I think the reason this affects me so much is that this type of behavior has<br/>
been going on all of my life with her and it is calling my mothering into<br/>
question...as if she doesn&#39;t think I am worthy of being a mother.  I would<br/>
feel this way regardless of the person...the issue comes in the appropriate<br/>
response that focuses on the positives and it centered in love, not fear.<br/>
If it were a stranger or just an acquaintance, it would be much easier to<br/>
tell them to mind their own business and leave us alone...lovingly, knowing<br/>
I would most likely never see them again.  But with her and any family<br/>
member or close friend, it has to be more thought out.<br/>
 <br/>
I appreciate the well wishes and ideas of how to reply to her.  I am glad to<br/>
have this group to bounce ideas/thoughts off of and help me through this<br/>
process of retraining myself to be a more engaged mother.  I will appreciate<br/>
any more replies people might have.  I have made a decision to not reply to<br/>
her until I am completely centered in love about it all...maybe as late as<br/>
next week..lol<br/>

references.  The statistical studies show that home educated children tend<br/>
to do as well as if not exceed their traditionally educated counterparts.<br/>
The articles that I have read that discredit homeschooling are written by<br/>
either uninformed individuals who have no information than what they make up<br/>
in their heads or by those that are basing their entire homeschool<br/>
information data on one poor example (and usually they are seeing that<br/>
example from an exterior viewpoint - some family at church or that they see<br/>
around town or know of through a friend of a friend.)  I find that the<br/>
articles written by those in the &quot;education field&quot; can&#39;t argue the learning<br/>
aspect based on statistics, so they tend to argue points such as limited<br/>
exposure to extra curricular activities (that means sports, cheerleading,<br/>
chorus and band) or poor socialisation skills.  And most of the time these<br/>
articles a written based on their hypothesis, not based on anything that<br/>
proves their hypothesis.  They assume that home educated families are<br/>
secluded and have no resources to provide sports, drama, music or art.<br/>
<br/>
I got into an argument with someone once who e-mailed me because of<br/>
something I said on my website once (I don&#39;t have that website anymore) He<br/>
was adamant that I was ruining my children&#39;s futures because they were<br/>
isolated, unsocialised and limited in what they could study.  He kept<br/>
throwing all these numbers at me from some supposed study.  I kept thinking,<br/>
&quot;WTF?  Where is he getting these numbers from?&quot; So finally I asked him for<br/>
citation of his statistics and he suddenly was no longer interested in<br/>
discussing it with me.  He made me out to be the one that was accusational.<br/>
I googled some of the stuff he was sending me and could find it no where.<br/>
So obviously he was making it all up!<br/>

hs&#39;ing, she&#39;s even starting to agree with unschooling. Her kids are all older now <br/>
and in college so she&#39;s not at the same place in life as I am as far as kids <br/>
go but she trusts me and my dh that we will do what&#39;s best for our kids and I <br/>
think she&#39;s starting to see the benefits of it already. (we&#39;ve only been <br/>
hs&#39;ing/unschooling for a little over a yr. now) My brother and my Dad on the other <br/>
hand, what a pain in the butt! My dh and I have both had family members do some <br/>
things to us that we would never allow a friend to do, we decided that just <br/>
because they are of the same blood doesn&#39;t mean we have to take poor behavior <br/>
from them. I certainly wouldn&#39;t allow a friend to treat me poorly, being of the <br/>
same family does not give them a free ticket to do so either.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1309000933">It&#39;s hard when we feel criticized or erroneously judged by family.  <br/>
<br/>
Your sister was hoping to educate you with that e-mail, &lt;g&gt; so that you<br/>
would do the right thing by your kids.   If you&#39;ve ever sent a friend or<br/>
family member a link to an anti spanking page or some social change<br/>
website or other you&#39;ve done the same thing.   It&#39;s not so bad.  <br/>
<br/>
In this case it *sucks* but it&#39;s not so bad. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I recommend staying away from your sister until your confidence in<br/>
unschooling has grown.  <br/>
I don&#39;t mean you should strike a line through her name or anything, but<br/>
don&#39;t go to her house or to family or social events where she will be<br/>
until you feel so confident about what your doing that her remarks won&#39;t<br/>
bother you any more than if she said &quot;you should try some of this<br/>
delicious cake.&quot; &lt;g&gt;   Because she won&#39;t be saying &quot;If you don&#39;t eat this<br/>
cake you&#39;re an uninformed, ignorant person making a bad choice.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Avoiding family members doesn&#39;t have to be an act of anger or bitterness.<br/>
 You have the right to do the best thing for yourself and your kids and<br/>
the best thing might just be to chill. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When you have more confidence and when your kids are a little older, your<br/>
sisters fears will be eased.  David&#39;s family gave us some trouble about<br/>
Dylan in the beginning but it&#39;s been years now since any of them has had<br/>
anything negative to say.  <br/>
<br/>
Try not to be hurt.  Easier said than done, I know.  <br/>
<br/>
If she calls you or emails you, you don&#39;t have to explain anything.  You<br/>
can say, &quot;Oh, how are you?  Sorry I&#39;ve got to run, catch you later.&quot; <br/>
If she asks specific questions you are not required in any way to answer<br/>
her.  You really can say &quot;Sorry sis, gotta go!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We feel we owe our parents/siblings an explanation of our choices and<br/>
decisions.  We don&#39;t.  We get to do what we want. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Later, when your sis sees your kids are normal and undamaged, think how<br/>
fun it will be to say &quot;NEENER!&quot; &lt;G&gt; (quietly, to yourself, of course, and<br/>
here! )   And you can complain to us if she bugs you.  Tell me where she<br/>
lives, I&#39;ll go muss her up. &lt;g&gt;</div>
