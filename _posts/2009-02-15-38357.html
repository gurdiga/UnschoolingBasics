<div id="ygrps-yiv-1243649106">Hi Lori,<br/>
<br/>
As a Miami native still residing in S Florida I can tell you that any large<br/>
city has it&#39;s share of crime and gangs.large cities in FL are no different.<br/>
None the less, in my neighborhood, as well as many others in the community,<br/>
I feel quite safe walking my daughter to the park, walking my small dogs at<br/>
night, ect.  A lot depends on the neighborhood, but you do not have to be in<br/>
a &quot;fancy&quot; or &quot;expensive&quot; area to feel safe.as long as you are comfortable<br/>
with people of many shades and cultures.FL is a real melting pot. On the<br/>
other hand there are lovely rural towns that feel like any other southern<br/>
small town, it really depends where you are. <br/>
<br/>
Regarding the job situation, I can only speak anecdotally, however FL is<br/>
full of elderly and boomers, so I would assume employment as a nurse is easy<br/>
to come by.in addition to hospitals, assisted  care facilities, nursing<br/>
homes, dr offices ect,  private care nurses are in high demand. As far as<br/>
painters go..well FL is one of the epicenters of the current real estate<br/>
fiasco, and in a time when belts are tightening maybe that is something<br/>
people will skimp on.but I really can&#39;t say.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, hope this answers some of your concerns regarding gangs;  the Miami<br/>
of the 80&#39;s (Miami vice, German tourist shootings, and carjacking) is really<br/>
a thing of the past.<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>
<br/>
Amanda<br/>
