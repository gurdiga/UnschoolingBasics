<div id="ygrps-yiv-43941127">Is anyone archiving? This is a great quote.  You should save it for the book<br/>
you&#39;ll write someday, Robyn.<br/>
<br/>
Krisula <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Radical Unschooling is extending that Trust to all areas of your whole<br/>
 </span></blockquote>life, living by general Principles such as Honesty, Kindness, Respect,<br/>
Acceptance, Generosity instead of having rules, chores, required behaviors,<br/>
punishments of any sort. It is about building relationships, respecting<br/>
children as autonomous beings and creating an environment where the freedom<br/>
to make real choices is fostered and individual preferences honored as much<br/>
as possible within real practical constraints (as opposed to having some<br/>
kind of behavioral control agenda).<br/>
