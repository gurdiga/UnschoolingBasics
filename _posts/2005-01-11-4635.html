<div id="ygrps-yiv-2027970750">&quot;***What about history and math,science?***&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I thought Deb&#39;s post was brilliant, and I won&#39;t be able to add much, <br/>
but what the heck, I feel like posting;<br/>
instead of seeing the world as a bunch of school subjects, try to <br/>
realize that all of these things surround us in daily life and are <br/>
totally interconnected.<br/>
<br/>
Last night, my boys had an unschooling friend over and I dropped <br/>
them off at the mall for a while. They walked home, counting all of <br/>
their steps from the mall to our front door. Why?<br/>
Because one of them (my Jared) said &quot;I wonder how many steps people <br/>
take every day?&quot; So one of them said &quot;let&#39;s count how many steps it <br/>
takes to get back to the house&quot;<br/>
and off they went.<br/>
They counted by 100 each time, then added all their hundreds up. <br/>
Trevor estimated it would take 1500 steps to get home, it took about <br/>
1700. They were laughing and sweaty and babbling excitedly when <br/>
telling me about this. <br/>
They were just having fun with their friends. None of them have <br/>
learned that math is something they need to be taught, or anything <br/>
painful or difficult (ok, Trevor had some of that many years ago, <br/>
but luckily he&#39;s healed) it&#39;s just a part of LIFE.<br/>
<br/>
That which we are surrounded by, we tend to pick up naturally, like <br/>
language.<br/>
So things like numbers, arithmetic, culture, history, places, <br/>
etc...are things we pick up, because we use them every day.<br/>
Things like karate, yoga, oil drilling, flying planes etc...aren&#39;t <br/>
things most of us are surrounded by every day, so we  need to find a <br/>
mentor or class to learn them. It&#39;s specialized information.<br/>
What schools teach is NOT specialized information.<br/>
It&#39;s out there for the taking.<br/>
And the most sad thing, is it&#39;s super EASY to pick up if you just <br/>
wait a while. Instead of wasting a child&#39;s life trying to force some <br/>
basic shite on them year after year after year...you can simply <br/>
allow them to BE and they&#39;ll pick up that &quot;basic&quot; stuff quite easily <br/>
at some point.<br/>
If every bit of k-8 math can be learned in three months by a child <br/>
that is interested, then WHY would people spend years trying to <br/>
shove it down their throats to the point that they have major <br/>
anxiety over it?<br/>
And WHY would anyone want to bring those methods home?<br/>
<br/>
Trust.<br/>
It really comes down to that simple word. You either trust your <br/>
children or you don&#39;t. If unschooling is going to work, you MUST <br/>
learn to trust them.<br/>
