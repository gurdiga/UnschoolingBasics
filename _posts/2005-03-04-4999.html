<div id="ygrps-yiv-732214430">Hi<br/>
<br/>
I have been unschooling 7 children  for 4 years. I didn&#39;t realise it had a<br/>
name until I read the Unschooling Handbook!    I had a brief period of<br/>
trying a more structured approach ( a momentary panic attack when eldest ds<br/>
hit 15 last year) which made the whole household miserable and we quickly<br/>
have reverted  to our haphazard, getting on with life learning style.  I<br/>
live in the UK and last week had a inspector from the Education Authority<br/>
round for a visit. It was the first visit I have ever had and some of it did<br/>
not go well as I had no idea or interest in what &quot;level&quot; the children were<br/>
at - in particular my two youngest twin boys who are just 6. Unschooling is<br/>
legal here and we have no restrictions but this person who came was not<br/>
impressed with the &quot;evidence of education &quot;( she wanted to see a whole<br/>
curriculum laid out on the table) and the none curriculum things the<br/>
children had done.  The truthful response was my twins do not write much yet<br/>
and only one reads a bit and I have no intention of pushing them into it<br/>
before they are ready. This did not go down well.  The person who came could<br/>
see something was working ( but not the kids lol)but was mystified as to<br/>
what and I found it very hard to explain how  my children learn by going<br/>
about their lives and doing things that interest them and playing. She just<br/>
screeched what about exams at me. Has anyone any good ways of putting what<br/>
unschooling is in a way a person from a very closed mindset like the LEA can<br/>
understand?  How to document untangible things?  How do you remember the<br/>
conversations and discussions and the day to day learning that just goes -<br/>
often unnoticed.I am looking forward to hearing what people think.  Thank<br/>
you.<br/>
Ruth<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am waiting for other responses too.  I like to ask people, &quot;How did you<br/>
learn to use your computer?  Did someone teach you how to turn it on or how<br/>
to run a program?  Did you take a computer course, and if so, is THAT where<br/>
you learned everything you know about computers now?  Did you memorize all<br/>
the parts of a computer before you attempted to use it?  (my son&#39;s computer<br/>
lit teacher told me that they kids would not touch the computer until &#39;they<br/>
learned the parts&#39;)  I learned what I know about the computer because I<br/>
wanted to!  I used the trial and error method for almost everything!  Sure,<br/>
I gained some new Tech support friends, but I learned so much from my<br/>
mistakes!  I crashed my computer and usually learned so much by the time I<br/>
got it running again.  Playing around with the color schemes, wallpaper, and<br/>
fonts really helped me learn my way around my hard drive.  When my modem<br/>
died and I didn&#39;t have much cash, I learned to install a modem!  When my CD<br/>
stopped working I found out that sometimes the wires can come loose and<br/>
since I knew how to take the tower apart, it was easy for me to fiddle<br/>
around in there...  In other words, I learned what I know about computers<br/>
because I WANTED to know about them or I had to learn something so I could<br/>
keep playing with my computer, no one forced me to &#39;memorize the parts&#39; or<br/>
to learn about them, I learned as a played.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;How to document untangible things?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m waiting for better responses for this one too!  Sometimes, I write about<br/>
the neat things my kids do or tell me about in a journal or in an e mail to<br/>
an e mail list!  Also, you can learn to see the educational value in<br/>
everyday ordinary things.  It&#39;s all a matter of how you look at it.  Like,<br/>
my daughter chatted on the computer most of the day today, but she was<br/>
TYPING and asking me how to spell certain words for her.  Her little brain<br/>
was working hard with trying to spell and then working hard trying to find<br/>
each letter.  &#39;On paper&#39; she worked on her computer lit, keyboarding,<br/>
spelling, language arts, reading, and socializing skills (not that that&#39;s a<br/>
skill)...  what else?  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;How do you remember the conversations and discussions and the day to day<br/>
&gt;learning that just goes - often unnoticed.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t, but there are days where they explode with all this information<br/>
that was seemingly unknown.  Sometimes it just works it&#39;s way to the<br/>
surface, but it usually goes unnoticed for months.  <br/>
<br/>
I sure hope to get some more answers from you other moms!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I forgot.  I want to know more about developmental psychologists&#39; research<br/>
on the brain and learning.  Maybe some familiar names like Piaget and<br/>
Elkind.  Wouldn&#39;t they support delayed academics or a more Unschooling<br/>
approach?  What are the names of like minded people that edu-crats would<br/>
recognize?  How about some Einstein quotes, or Einstein and Edison&#39;s<br/>
stories?  You know, like how they were kicked out of school and thought of<br/>
as &#39;stupid&#39; so they got to spend much time at home doing what they wanted to<br/>
do?  Those are good stories to give as examples.  What else would help<br/>
closed minded people?<br/>
<br/>
In college, my education professors seemed to lean more towards &quot;child led<br/>
learning&quot; and they seemed to be more for a &quot;developmental appropriate&quot;<br/>
education.  I even remember telling one of my professors that I wanted to do<br/>
research on Unschooling, but that I couldn&#39;t find anything.  I vaguely<br/>
remember one of my professors mentioning John Holt! They didn&#39;t agree with<br/>
much that was going on in the public schools.  But, that type of attitude<br/>
doesn&#39;t win more $$$$ from the public.  Those wonderful methods that we<br/>
learned about in college aren&#39;t always the best at popping out good multiple<br/>
choice test scores.  So, they aren&#39;t going to win over the public.  ::rolls<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1170858698">Hi Everyone,<br/>
     I am new to this group and new to unschooling. We have been<br/>
homeschooling for about 3 years now. I have 3 DDs ages 10,7, and 2.<br/>
While I can&#39;t say we are unshooling yet, it is something I want to<br/>
move towards.I will probably just be listening to you all for now and<br/>
then maybe pop in with a question or two. I am reading The Unprocessed<br/>
Child right now but also wonder if any of you have teens or older and<br/>
how it is going. Also how it is with more than one child? Mine play<br/>
alot together which is great. I am just curious as to how having more<br/>
than one affects the dynamics of unschooling( as far as following<br/>
Individual interests) They play so much together that I don&#39;t see them<br/>
doing as much independently. Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-345808194">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Sarah. I&#39;ve been planning on homeschooling my son since<br/>
before he was born (he&#39;s 5 1/2 now) and in the last year or so, have<br/>
been really turned on to the idea of Unschooling. I have a new baby<br/>
(well she&#39;s 7 month old now, but I&#39;m still adjusting to her being<br/>
here) and people (think my parents!) keep asking me what we are<br/>
&quot;doing&quot; as far as homeschooling is concerned, and I&#39;m feeling at a<br/>
loss to know what to say. My son Gryphon is intellengent and has a<br/>
wide variety of interests, I know he&#39;s learning everyday, we do lots<br/>
of outside activities, nothing formal, but we&#39;re out of the house alot<br/>
and scooting around town to things, he&#39;s got lots of interaction  as<br/>
we have interest. I&#39;m just joining to learn a bit more about this<br/>
unschooling style and to get more info on how to keep records and how<br/>
to better confirm to people and to myself that I&#39;m actually &quot;doing&quot;<br/>
something with him and that he is actually &quot;learning&quot; Wondering if<br/>
people who are unschooling try to &quot;teach&quot; anything at all, or is it<br/>
just totally child directed, or a combo. (I&#39;m sure there are no hard<br/>
and fast rules, just currious what a typical day might look like) We<br/>
have an Oak Meadow curriulum that was given to us and I might try to<br/>
do some of the activities out of there this fall, Gryphon is<br/>
expressing an interest in reading and so I figured maybe I would try<br/>
some phonics stuff.. I dunno.. feeling a little lost...<br/>
<br/>
Look forward to learning more from you all!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-113800094">Hi Sarah. Sounds like you answered your own question &quot;I know he&#39;s <br/>
learning everyday&quot; - that&#39;s pretty much the bottom line, isn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
Recordkeeping - what do the LAWS of your state require (including <br/>
what the minimum compulsory age is - not always 5)? That&#39;s what you <br/>
need to consider. For instance, here in CT, there is no <br/>
recordkeeping or testing or reporting requirement of any kind, so we <br/>
don&#39;t do any recordkeeping. We do email grandma and chat with family <br/>
about stuff DS (just turned 7) is doing. Note we talk about what he <br/>
is *doing* not what we&#39;re &quot;teaching&quot; or he&#39;s &quot;learning&quot; - it&#39;s as <br/>
much about video games and hot wheels cars as it is about books and <br/>
chess games.<br/>
<br/>
There are long archive threads about &quot;teaching&quot; - if by teaching you <br/>
mean providing information and assistance in developing a skill he <br/>
has decided to pursue, then yes we do some teaching. However, if by <br/>
teaching you mean we decide that &quot;at his age he should know&quot; this or <br/>
that and then we focus on it and make sure it gets into him, no we <br/>
don&#39;t teach.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;We have an Oak Meadow curriulum that was given to us and I might <br/>
&gt; try &gt;to&gt; do some of the activities out of there this fall, Gryphon <br/>
&gt; is&gt; expressing an interest in reading and so I figured maybe I <br/>
&gt; would &gt;try&gt; some phonics stuff<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If he&#39;s expressing interest -now- why not simply do some reading -<br/>
now-, any particular reason to wait until fall? Do you want to hear <br/>
about DS learning to read? If not, skip this next paragraph of <br/>
anecdotal evidence. He was almost 5 and told us we &quot;needed&quot; to get <br/>
Hooked on Phonics so he could learn to read. I suggested that since <br/>
HOP took $$ and time to arrive, maybe we could start with something <br/>
we already had handy. He was okay with that (immediacy above all <br/>
things!lol). Note, at this point he already knew letters, letter <br/>
sounds, a handful of sight words (exit, on, off, dog, stop, etc). I <br/>
pulled out 100 ez lessons (I picked it up at a discount and thought <br/>
it would be handy to have around). 5 minutes later it was a <br/>
disaster! Too many words on the page (despite them being mostly <br/>
my &#39;script&#39;) were intimidating and the parts for him were too simple <br/>
and silly for him. Put that away (and then *gave* it away). At <br/>
bedtime I grabbed the first set of Bob books (yup I bought them too -<br/>
 just in case...) We looked at them together, he asked me to read <br/>
them all. So I did. Next night, he read the first book and said &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
a reader!&quot; (direct quote from the commercial for HOP lol) and I did <br/>
the rest. Next night, he did two of them and we moved on to other <br/>
stuff. That was a bit over 2 years ago and he can pretty much read <br/>
anything he chooses at this point (food labels to check nutrition <br/>
and contents are big for him, video game instructions and guides, <br/>
bits of magazines at will, like National Geographic). He *learned* <br/>
to read, *we* did NOT teach him to read. Best I can figure, he <br/>
absorbs words then breaks them down into pieces and applies the <br/>
patterns to new words as he comes across them. Mostly we provided a <br/>
word rich environment. Kind of like providing a nutrient &quot;soup&quot; to <br/>
grow cells - give them the stuff they need when they need it and <br/>
they absorb it and grow. The &quot;when&quot; and &quot;what&quot; for kids are <br/>
individual and unique. There&#39;s really no set timetable for any of <br/>
it. Another way to look at it might be as a buffet - we may get <br/>
extra napkins and support the plate and help scoop but DS decides <br/>
what and how much and in what order he wants things. Sometimes he <br/>
eats 3 servings of mac & cheese; other times he has lots of jello; <br/>
sometimes he has a different arrangement on each go-round. And, in <br/>
between things, he is digesting and that is a *critical* part of <br/>
things yet it is totally invisible from the outside - just as <br/>
absorbing things like reading and such are invisible to us on the <br/>
outside. <br/>
<br/>
Mostly, have FUN!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-941072654">Every day looks different here.  But the one thing that is a constant<br/>
throughout all days is that when the kids want to know something or do<br/>
something or I sense them needing me, I try my best to answer their<br/>
questions and help them do what they want to do or just be with them. It&#39;s<br/>
really all about *being* with them.   <br/>
<br/>
Some days are spent playing computer games all day. Other days are spent at<br/>
the horse barn.  Some days we spend half the day playing board games and<br/>
other days we spend in the pool or curled up with a good book.  The thing<br/>
is, as long as you are involved with your kids, really listening to them,<br/>
they will learn.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t spend the bulk of most days cleaning my house to impress the<br/>
relatives, I spend it *being* with my kids.  Not just in body, but in mind.<br/>
Being present in the moment.   I give them my whole attention when I am<br/>
being with them.  I am not saying that they don&#39;t spend huge parts of some<br/>
days playing with their friends or at the computer, but I do make sure that<br/>
every day we make a connection and I give them my full attention.  If that<br/>
doesn&#39;t happen until after dinner and the dishes are piled up and I am<br/>
tired, I still try to put those worries aside and just *be* with my kids.<br/>
<br/>
  That *being* with them can look like snuggling in front of the TV, or<br/>
looking something up on-line, or helping them craft or paint, reading to<br/>
them, playing in the pool with them, spending time at the barn with<br/>
them...helping with the horses.  When you spend that amount of time really<br/>
present with your kids, you can&#39;t help but notice that they are learning all<br/>
the time.<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest you skip the OM curriculum and spend time playing with your<br/>
son.  If he wants to know how to read, help him while he has the interest,<br/>
don&#39;t wait until fall.  But also, don&#39;t push more than he wants.  It can be<br/>
a delicate balance but he&#39;ll let you know when you&#39;ve gone to far if you<br/>
listen to him.   If he would have fun labeling things in the house or<br/>
matching pictures and words or playing letter sound games then by all means,<br/>
play those things with him.  If he only meant that he wanted to be able to<br/>
read and write his name then stop when he has had his fill.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-284556315">&quot; So are you<br/>
doing anything currently with your 2 ½ yo?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I hope you don&#39;t feel picked on Misty, but I&#39;d like to examine this<br/>
question a bit.<br/>
<br/>
Why would an unschooler be &quot;doing anything&quot; other than living life<br/>
with their children?  When someone asks if you&#39;re &quot;doing anything&quot;<br/>
that usually means schoolish stuff, or &quot;educational&quot; activities. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t about some magical age where we start &quot;doing&quot; with<br/>
our children. We do the things they need and enjoy from birth.<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t about buying specialized educational toys (though<br/>
sometimes they do swirl into our lives) or specialized &quot;social&quot;<br/>
groups. We trust that our children are learning all the time by<br/>
examining the things that fascinate them.<br/>
A Leap Pad is not better than dirt.<br/>
Museum trips are not more important than squishing playdough.<br/>
Allowing our children the freedom to enjoy anything and everything<br/>
that fascinates them is paramount. Being with them and just smelling<br/>
the flowers, digging up bugs or watching power rangers is more<br/>
powerful for a child that is interested in those things, than any<br/>
reading/writing/arithmetic type of activity.<br/>
<br/>
Trust your child to simply BE a child.<br/>
Trust that learning is happening all the time.<br/>
You don&#39;t need to start feeding in educational shows or games or<br/>
activities to make her learn. Just be in her world and pick up the<br/>
things that interest her as you explore together.<br/>
<br/>
That is unschooling.<br/>

I didn&#39;t mean what are you doing to introduce him to letters, numbers or<br/>
whatever.  I&#39;m just curious what activities other unschoolers are doing with<br/>
their kids at this age.  Maybe their child enjoys something that I never<br/>
thought of doing with my dd.  Some days can seem a bit monotonous.  My<br/>
daughter doesn&#39;t really watch any t.v., and sometimes the day seems to drag,<br/>
so I was just looking for some possible new ideas.  Also, I&#39;m very new to<br/>
unschooling, and I am still trying to get a grasp on the difference btwn<br/>
child led home schooling and unschooling.  But I do feel that especially at<br/>
this age it&#39;s important to expose them to all kinds of &quot;activities&quot; to find<br/>
where their interests lie. just as you might take an older child to a museum<br/>
exhibit if it seemed like something that might interest them.  At this age<br/>
they don&#39;t always know what they will and won&#39;t like, so you have to do<br/>
things to help you both figure it out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1559548147">I agree for example my son was a lump at fifteen months - he didn&#39;t seem to<br/>
want to do anything but watch and well I can&#39;t say that I was that exciting.<br/>
My daughter who is now fifteen months doesn&#39;t stop moving. She likes to draw<br/>
or taste the crayons. She might like dough but I need to get out my peanut<br/>
butter recipe so I am not concerned about her eating the dough. I realize<br/>
playdough is non-toxic but you never know about those dyes.<br/>
<br/>
My DD learns a lot from her brother but when it was just me and my DS we did<br/>
the stuff I wanted to do until he was old enough to decide for himself. This<br/>
time of year is great for nature walks, library trips, park trips, window<br/>
shopping, etc. Let me know what you are into and the area you live in and<br/>
I&#39;ll give you a bunch of ideas. Not for education but it sounds like you are<br/>
bored and need ideas of new things to do.<br/>

-&quot;Why would an unschooler be &quot;doing anything&quot; other than living life<br/>
with their children?  When someone asks if you&#39;re &quot;doing anything&quot;<br/>
that usually means schoolish stuff, or &quot;educational&quot; activities.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t mean what are you doing to introduce him to letters, numbers or<br/>
whatever.  I&#39;m just curious what activities other unschoolers are doing with<br/>
their kids at this age.  Maybe their child enjoys something that I never<br/>
thought of doing with my dd.  Some days can seem a bit monotonous.  My<br/>
daughter doesn&#39;t really watch any t.v., and sometimes the day seems to drag,<br/>
so I was just looking for some possible new ideas.  Also, I&#39;m very new to<br/>
unschooling, and I am still trying to get a grasp on the difference btwn<br/>
child led home schooling and unschooling.  But I do feel that especially at<br/>
this age it&#39;s important to expose them to all kinds of &quot;activities&quot; to find<br/>
where their interests lie. just as you might take an older child to a museum<br/>
exhibit if it seemed like something that might interest them.  At this age<br/>
they don&#39;t always know what they will and won&#39;t like, so you have to do<br/>
things to help you both figure it out.<br/>

My dd loves play dough, but I make my own with a very simple recipe.  I<br/>
don&#39;t even use food coloring.  If you need the recipe let me know and I&#39;ll<br/>
post it.  I also have a couple for finger paints if you&#39;re interested, but<br/>
you&#39;d definitely need some sort of coloring for that.  They do make some all<br/>

are new and it seems wanting to raise your son in an unschooling lifestyle I<br/>
would encourage you to read some of the articles at<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1601146558">My name is Charis and I am married to a wonderful man for almost 11 <br/>
years and we have a 10 year old son.<br/>
Unfortunately, he was in public schools from Pre-K to half of first <br/>
grade.  He left first grade for winter break and never returned.<br/>
Honestly, we have tried school-at-home and it just frustrates me and <br/>
him.  He isn&#39;t reading as well as he&#39;d like so we&#39;re working on that <br/>
because the phonics he learned in public school have not stuck with <br/>
him.  <br/>
Anyway, he spent Spring Break with my husband&#39;s mother and I did a <br/>
lot of research on &quot;unschooling&quot; and decided when he returned home we <br/>
would start with a fresh attitude about education.<br/>
Well, while there, my DMiL told him that he would basically be better <br/>
off in public school because then he would have friends.<br/>
He has friends.  He doesn&#39;t see them every day but he sees them often <br/>
and we have explained that to her.  She never says anything negative <br/>
about homeschooling in front of me and my husband but when DS is <br/>
alone with her she encourages him to tell us he wants to go back to <br/>
public school.<br/>
My husband will be confronting her about this soon.  But, he has a <br/>
bad attitude now and I&#39;m very frustrated so I guess I&#39;m just looking <br/>
to talk with people who have made it through these situations and <br/>
just looking to talk with like-minded people.<br/>
My husband believes in the school-at-home thing but he will not <br/>
question me when I try something new with him if he sees positive <br/>
results.<br/>
Sorry this post is so long. Can&#39;t wait to get to know you all.<br/>

*I*, not my husband, would let her know, in NO uncertain terms, that, <br/>
if she can&#39;t hold her tongue, she would not be allowed to spend time <br/>
with him any more.<br/>
<br/>
She had her chance with my husband. THIS child is not her <br/>
responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
She does NOT get the opportunity to hijack my parenting. Ever.<br/>
<br/>
I did this with my mother, my husband&#39;s mother and his father&#39;s second <br/>
wife. It was inconvenient sometimes, but I also kept the boys from them <br/>
for several months to show them I was dead serious.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1156761441">Hello, I am new here. Just wanted to say hi. I love what I have been <br/>
reading. I am a 22 yo single mother. My dd is 2. I always knew I wanted <br/>
to homeschool and now I am sure unschooling is for us. Even tho dd is <br/>
only 2 I have already had things said to me by my mom, dance teacher, <br/>
aunts, etc. about her not following direction and being wild. I had to <br/>
pull her out of dance class recently because the teacher talked to her <br/>
in a way that was completely degrading because she wasn&#39;t doing what <br/>
all the other students were doing. She&#39;s 2 for goodness sake! Just <br/>
needed to vent.Thanks. But we are having a problem where dd cries that <br/>
there is a ghost everywhere. She gets really upset. I&#39;m not sure <br/>
whether to tell her there is not one, play along and tell her it might <br/>
be a nice ghost, or what. Any suggestions?</div>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Definitely don&#39;t negate her belief that there&#39;s a ghost - to her it&#39;s <br/>
real and you&#39;d be questioning her sense of reality (that didn&#39;t come <br/>
out right really but I&#39;m not sure how to rephrase it). What I might do <br/>
is talk to her, get information about her ghosts - where are they, <br/>
what are they doing, etc. NOT &quot;playing along&quot; but really and truly <br/>
having a conversation about it - after all, she MAY be seeing ghosts, <br/>
you have no way of knowing. When someone is &quot;playing along&quot; their <br/>
whole manner (voice, posture, facial expression, etc) changes and <br/>
she&#39;s likely to pick up on it. Think of it more as someone from a <br/>
different culture who is trying to explain something to you about <br/>
something you&#39;ve never experienced. You&#39;ve never seen it so you have <br/>
noidea what it is and your &#39;guest&#39; has limited conversational skills <br/>
in your language. You&#39;d ask lots of questions and really listen hard <br/>
to the answers to try to understand it, wouldn&#39;t you.<br/>
<br/>
If you discuss it and she needs tools to deal with them, help her get <br/>
those tools. If they tend to cluster in certain areas, avoid them if <br/>
that&#39;s possible (like if they pop up in crowded stores or whatever). <br/>
If it&#39;s someplace like her bedroom, the bathroom, etc where you really <br/>
can&#39;t avoid the location, make her a &quot;ghost spray&quot; that she can use at <br/>
will. Something like mint or wintergreen or lavendar in water in a <br/>
spray bottle (something that smells nice but leaves no marks or <br/>
stains) that she can use to hold them at bay might help - basically, <br/>
ARM her as well as be WITH her when she is going into those areas <br/>
(make another bottle for yourself maybe). Basically, look for common <br/>
threads - when and where is it most likely that she&#39;ll be bothered by <br/>
them? That may give you some insight into where they are coming from <br/>
and you can use that information to help her with them.<br/>
<br/>
2 yr olds are just starting to grasp that the world is WAY bigger than <br/>
they are. Up until them, a tight circle of mom and child and other <br/>
immediate family is pretty much &quot;the world&quot; even if you&#39;re out and <br/>
about all the time. At 2, they&#39;re starting to be able to venture forth <br/>
into the wide world and it can be scary. That&#39;s why some kids go into <br/>
the &quot;separation anxiety&quot; phase around that age - they&#39;re discovering <br/>
that there&#39;s &quot;stuff&quot; Out There. It&#39;s interesting that your DD is <br/>
specific that it&#39;s ghosts, not generic monsters or darkness or <br/>
anything, but ghosts.<br/>

Any chance you saw the Little Bill episode in which Little Bill is afraid  of <br/>
monsters in his closet? His Great Grandmother, *I* thought, handled it so  <br/>
well and so gently. She believed him and went to fight for her grandbaby! And  <br/>
they did it together...if you get the chance, it might help you two out also! <br/>
:) <br/>
 <br/>
Here&#39;s one synopsis I found:<br/>
 <br/>
The Magic Quilt: Little Bill can&#39;t sleep one night and  asks Alice the Great <br/>
to help him investigate &quot;the Thing&quot; in his closet that is  keeping him awake. <br/>
Alice the Great checks the closet out, and after determining  &quot;the Thing&quot; must <br/>
have left because of her, gives Little Bill a special &#39;magic  quilt&#39; with <br/>
colorful patches that will help him get to sleep. She tells him to  think about <br/>
how the patches remind him of happy times and he won&#39;t think about  the things <br/>
that scare him. Little Bill quickly drifts off to sleep, and the next  <br/>
morning, when he mentions how Alice helped him, Bobby, April and Brenda tell him  how <br/>
Alice used the quilt with them, too.<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway :) I loved it, and who knows, it might give you an idea that  respects <br/>
and validates and helps - all in one snazzy motion!<br/>
 <br/>
Karen in so. cal :) <br/>

all, she MAY be seeing ghosts, you have no way of knowing. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I agree! When dd was very young she would tell me about kids that<br/>
tried to talk to her when she was going to sleep. She was more annoyed<br/>
by it than scared. She specifically spoke about one little boy dressed<br/>
in a red shirt who just wouldn&#39;t be quiet. Although I have never had<br/>
such experiences, I was willing to take her seriously and understand<br/>
that she very well may have been experiencing these things. I talked<br/>
to her about in a factual kind of way (not as though I was just<br/>
humoring her) and together we came up with ideas that might encourage<br/>
these visitors to let her sleep peacefully.<br/>
<br/>
This issue subsided after a couple months. Not long after that she<br/>
started telling me about memories she had of us playing together as<br/>
children, when I was her sister. She would share very vivid details<br/>
about the games we played, what we wore, the house we lived in, etc.<br/>
She told me she really missed us being kids together (and cried).<br/>
Again, I took her totally serious. I cannot know if these were real<br/>
memories or if they came from somewhere deep inside her imagination,<br/>
but to her they were very real and that&#39;s what mattered.<br/>
<br/>
About a year later her great-grandfather, whom she had a special<br/>
relationship with, passed away unexpectedly. The phone rang late at<br/>
night, it was my mom calling to tell me. I spoke with her quietly and<br/>
hung up. A moment later we heard dd crying - we found her sitting up<br/>
in her bed, shaking and sobbing. She said that &quot;big papa&quot; (her name<br/>
for him) had come to &quot;say goodbye&quot;, she woke up and he was sitting on<br/>
her bed. She related that he&#39;d told her he was leaving and she<br/>
wouldn&#39;t see him anymore. This news was very upsetting to her. Did it<br/>
really happen? What I focused on where her feelings, because they were<br/>
real and needed to be cared for. All I can say is that for whatever<br/>
reason, the universe wanted to give her a chance to say goodbye to<br/>
him, no matter whether it was a coincidental dream or a &quot;other<br/>
worldly&quot; phenomenon.<br/>
<br/>
She has never been shamed in any way for sharing these things with us,<br/>
and we never took her feelings lightly, even when our life experience<br/>
has made it difficult to completely understand her experiences. This<br/>
is not to say that humor and similar coping tools haven&#39;t been useful<br/>
- we just never employed them in a dismissive/mocking way. In many<br/>
ways, she has opened up new windows into the world for us. I cannot<br/>
imagine children going through similar experiences and not having<br/>
anyone take them seriously. They should have someone they feel safe<br/>
sharing these things with, someone who can validate their feelings and<br/>
be supportive.<br/>

Just wanted to introduce myself.  My 6-year old daughter is currently <br/>

probably a mistake to send her there.  We&#39;re almost 100% certain we&#39;ll <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-141452684">Hi Elaine,<br/>
My caveat is I&#39;ve never homeschooled a child with ADD, but as a (very<br/>
frustrated and quickly burning out) public school teacher AND an adult with<br/>
ADD (without the &#39;H&#39;) I think I can give you some insights. First of all, I<br/>
think unschooling is the natural way for everyone to learn, *especially* ADD<br/>
kids. As an adult, I can remember more things I learned outside of school,<br/>
at my own pace and in my own way (i.e. books I read for pleasure, things I<br/>
learned through play, through family activities, extracurriculars, etc) than<br/>
things I learned in school. The wonderful thing about unschooling is that<br/>
you can just enjoy life, and let the learning happen. Having said that, as a<br/>
mom/teacher I know *I* would be uptight about making sure that my child is<br/>
learning everything she&#39;ll need to know. That&#39;s where my more &#39;schooly&#39;<br/>
tendencies would come in, and I&#39;m almost afraid to admit that on this<br/>
board...but my suggestion is you can control the input and influence you<br/>
have on your daughter by making decisions that may not affect *directly*<br/>
what she learns, but indirectly, by defining what she&#39;s exposed to. By way<br/>
of an example, as a child I was a bookworm and would read just about<br/>
anything that crossed my hands. I was lucky that my parents picked up on<br/>
this and made some good decisions about the kind of literature they exposed<br/>
me to. (Abridged versions of the classics at an early age made me familiar<br/>
with the stories so that later nothing intimidated me, for example). Another<br/>
thing is that they offered me music lessons (different instruments at<br/>
different times in my life) but always gave me the option to try something<br/>
for a while and then quit after a reasonable period of time if there was<br/>
some problem. This was very enrichment and it didn&#39;t &quot;teach me I could quit&quot;<br/>
like some may fear, it taught me to appreciate music and actually helped me<br/>
decide to stick with it once I found &quot;my&quot; instrument was a wind instrument<br/>
(the flute) vs. a string instrument (I quit the cello after only a month or<br/>
so). Yeah, I  now wish I could play the cello too, but most of all I&#39;m<br/>
grateful for the opportunities. OK, I&#39;ve gone on too long now, but I guess<br/>
the point I wanted to make was it&#39;ll be up to you to provide the<br/>
opportunities for your daughter as an unschooler. As long as you keep those<br/>
opportunities coming in a wide range of areas (sports and physical activity,<br/>
visual and performing arts, academics, etc) I think this could be very very<br/>
good for your daughter. Best of luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1384665137">Hi Elaine,<br/>
<br/>
My 11 yr. old son has Asperger&#39;s Syndrome.  While it isn&#39;t the same <br/>
diagnosis as ADHD, it&#39;s still considered a special needs situation.  <br/>
What I&#39;ve learned in our 6 years of homeschooling is that special <br/>
needs isn&#39;t always as &quot;special&quot; at home as it seems to be in school.  <br/>
It seems like schools expect all children to fit into one mold by <br/>
having the same behaviors.  When a child is unable to fit into that <br/>
mold, they are considered to need special attention, hence the special <br/>
needs label.  At home, we don&#39;t have those same rules and expectations.<br/>
<br/>
My son didn&#39;t make it through Kindergarten.  It was definitely not a <br/>
good environment for him.  We didn&#39;t get a diagnosis for his Aspergers <br/>
until he was 9 years old, but it sure did provide answers for many of <br/>
my concerns.  At home, my son can be himself.  I don&#39;t compare him to <br/>
his sisters.  It&#39;s okay if they have different interests or <br/>
abilities.  He&#39;s not required to fit himself into an artificial <br/>
environment.  Being able to follow his own schedule is definitely the <br/>
best learning situation for him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-695741730">I apologize if my intro reaches some of you a second time. I joined a couple <br/>
of unschooling groups at the same time and didn&#39;t want to have to reword the <br/>
entire thing. Laziness or efficiency? I&#39;ll take the latter.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Hi, everyone. I&#39;m Lisa (I will go by my nickname of Blue, since I&#39;m thinking<br/>
there will be quite a few Lisas on a list this active), a 46-year-old<br/>
Florida mama who has home-schooled her kids for the past 20 years. I only<br/>
have a 17-year-old, and an almost-15-year-old left who are &quot;school<br/>
age&quot; (don&#39;t panic--I&#39;m learning the ropes here! LOL). I&#39;ve been reading<br/>
Holt, Gatto, and others for years, but could never seem to totally &quot;let go&quot;<br/>
and entrust my kids with their own educations (gosh, when I type it out like<br/>
that, it sounds terrible!). Okay, let me say that in a way that doesn&#39;t make<br/>
me feel like an awful mom...hrm...got it. I&#39;ve always felt like it was my<br/>
responsibility as a mom to &quot;teach&quot; my kids. In fact, I teach everyone&#39;s<br/>
kids. Oh, dear...is there hope for me?<br/>
<br/>
On the positive side (thank goodness there is one--and also that there is<br/>
such a thing as parentheses, or I&#39;d be sunk), I LOVE to learn. Like,<br/>
seriously. I am constantly going off on some rabbit trail because of a<br/>
question my kids ask me. Why, just this morning, one of them asked me how<br/>
&quot;soap operas&quot; got their name. I wagered a guess, then looked it up so we<br/>
would both know (I was half right! Score!).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d better stop there for now. Glad to &quot;meet&quot; you all.</div>
