A wee glimpse into lots and lots of unschoolers lives, for a moment.<br/>
I&#39;ve really enjoyed reading everyone&#39;s glimpses, and thought it would<br/>
be nice to start the same thread over here.  For anyone brand new to<br/>
unschooling, or thinking about unschooling, it can offer up some brief<br/>
&quot;typical day&quot; moments.<br/>
<br/>
So....<br/>
    in my house right now, most of the inhabitants are sleeping. I&#39;ve<br/>
got a wee man in my bed, a girl on my floor and Jared popping his head<br/>
in every so often to see if his Kalonline money got deposited<br/>
(purchased at Ebay last night) to  his account. Trevor is still asleep<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
Not much of a glimpse here I&#39;m afraid....but things will get busier in<br/>
a while.:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1343870809">LOL thanks Ren. I didn&#39;t think to start the thread here, but I have really enjoyed the way the thread took off elsewhere! <br/>
<br/>
  This minute, Logan(5) and Gracie (2) are watching The DoodleBops on the Disney Channel while lying on the floor. Both have more than one lollipop in each hand right now. Megan (4) is walking around the house with the cat talking to it about not going poopy here, don&#39;t go poopy there. <br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;m chatting with a friend on IM and ignoring the laundry pile in the hallway. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-40748268">My son, Quentin, 10, is rummaging around the kitchen looking for food.  We<br/>
just went over the ingredients we&#39;ll need to make &quot;teddy bear cupcakes&quot;<br/>
later this afternoon.  He fond the recipe in &quot;Your Big Backyard&quot; magazine.<br/>
He also showed me a game he&#39;d like me to look for on ebay (Dragonball Z<br/>
Budokai 2).  My daughter, Sierra, 7, is just waking up.  She slept on the<br/>
futon in the art room.  My husband is on the phone in his office (which is<br/>
down the hall).  We&#39;ll be kicking into high gear in a few minutes in order<br/>
to get to the park - today is our weekly homeschool park day  :-)  I&#39;ve been<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-218529003">Hi I am new here.  This is our 3rd year homeschooling.  Matt is 8, Carrie is 2 1/2, Annie is 1, and baby #4 is due this summer.  Matt never went to public school - we have homeschooled from the beginning.  We are ecclectic homeschoolers.  That sounds fancy but what it means here is that we throw things in here and there throughout the day and most everything depends on the craziness with the little ones and how I am feeling during this pregnancy.  Matt has ADHD so we had started with a very structured environment for him since that is generally what works well for kids who have ADHD.  However, he hated it so we have since moved to a very relaxed way of doing things.  Right now I am really bored with how we are doing things, but Matt seems ok.  I have ordered some homeschooling magazines so that I might find some inspiration.  That is also why I am on this site.  I have read some info about unschooling and I am not sure if we fit this category or not.  I do lead some of the learning<br/>
 and Matt also leads me.  It is great fun to follow his freight train of thought!  I have found that he does do well with a little bit of structure though.<br/>
   <br/>
  Here is our day so far today......<br/>
    took an hour to get him out of bed and going as he stayed up until well after midnight reading books.  had breakfast and did his chores.  Asked me what we were going to do first.....I pretty much always give him his choice.  He is learning multiplication and division so I give him the choice of the Twist and Shout Multipication toy or a few lessons in the Singapore math workbook.  He chooses the workbook.  Then he spends 30 minutes in his room reading something other than Captain Underpants and old Looney Tunes comic books - I think he chose one of the Secret of Droon books.  He has been dying to try   the experiment with white carnations and food coloring to see how the water travels up the stem - i actually remembered to get the flowers, so we did that.  He had a ball!!!  The best part for him was mixing the different food colorings to make the colors on the back of the box!  Then he played on the laptop with some Living Books for about 30 minutes.  Now he is in the basement<br/>
 playing on the computer for 30 minutes of free time before lunch and naptime for the little girls.  When they nap, Matt and I usually do something together - a game of Scrabble or something like that.  Then he will spend the rest of the day in his room building things with Imaginext, Magnetix, or these marble tunnel things.  He also reads A LOT!!  For Christmas he received a set of Hardy Boys hardback books so he is enjoying those as well.  We had company over the weekend and they taught me to play Texas Hold &#39;em and Matt was dying to learn too.  So, in the evenings we have been teaching him to play that with us.  He has asked me 3-4 times today if we can play NOW.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Anyway, that is our day - I really have no idea where to classify us though!!!<br/>
   <br/>
  Jill - who will find her way soon!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-219779571">Right now Josh and Emily are watching cartoon network (Tom and  <br/>
Jerry), Rachel and Sam are making sandwiches out of tuna and  <br/>
chocolate chip cookies (lol!) Breanna is jumping on our indoor  <br/>

<br/>
I just put a roast in the crockpot, and was wondering if any of the  <br/>
kids wanted to hit up the library. I wanted to check online and see  <br/>
what new books they have before I get there, maybe request them so I  <br/>
can just grab MY books and then be with the kids. Daddy just left to  <br/>
walk back to work.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-159342675">We just got back from Walmart. Logan wanted Bandaids, so he picked out some Hot Wheels ones. I asked him to help me keep track of how much we were spending, because I only had $12 in cash with me. I explained why I wanted to count the $1.88 box of Bandaids as $2, then we went from there buying a loaf of bread, some prepared tuna salad, a box of popcorn, a can of Pringles, a package of cookies the kids wanted to try (generic Mallomars), and a package of cotton candy. Megan and Gracie counted to 10 over and over while we walked around. We met a couple ladies shopping who invited us to their church as we stood talking. Logan helped me to use the checkout (we love the self-checkers) and bag the groceries, then he counted the money as he put it into the machine. <br/>

He wants to go to Barnes and Noble to buy a new Manga book. Then we have fencing tonight. I think James and Tristram are spending the night again.<br/>

Cameron is on his second hour of drumming on his drum pad. He has pipe and drum rehearsal this evening. He and I&#39;ve watched That 70s Show, Southpark, and My Name is Earl that we TiVoed earlier this week. He has nine more minutes of drumming to make it two hours (My brain will be ticking off drumbeats for a while after this! &lt;g&gt;). He&#39;s been practicing a little magic since the magic convention he helped out at this past weekend. I&#39;m a VERY good magic audience! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I ran a few errands this morning and got a haircut. I bought a bunch of bird and squirrel food from Wild Birds today (Xmas gift cards)---I want to set up the new feeders.

Then I get to poke people with pointy sticks for two hours! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-97566902">&quot;Here is our day so far today......<br/>
took an hour to get him out of bed and going as he stayed up until<br/>
well after midnight reading books.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A lot of us have night owls. We&#39;ve found that learning unfolds better<br/>
and more joyfully if you let people sleep until they&#39;re fully rested<br/>
and stay up until they&#39;re tired.:)  I used to hide my books and stay<br/>
up until all hours reading.  How much better if a child is supported<br/>
in whatever it is they&#39;re interested in at the moment. Maybe you could<br/>
just let him read and fall asleep whenever he drops the book?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;had breakfast and did his chores. Asked me what<br/>
we were going to do first&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If unschooling is your goal (I&#39;m not saying it is, only offering up<br/>
what will help IF it&#39;s your goal), then getting to the point where he<br/>
isn&#39;t asking you what is happening first will be a big stepping stone.<br/>
If he&#39;s used to you giving the options and telling him his limited<br/>
choices, it might take a while.<br/>
<br/>
.....&quot;I pretty much always give him his choice.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, but it&#39;s not much of a choice really! :)<br/>
How about opening up to a bunch of new possibilities...like a movie, a<br/>
walk a trip to the grocery store for some new and interesting foods<br/>
you both want to try, play tag, use flashlights in the dark, make<br/>
popcorn and toss it up to catch it in your mouths, anything goes!<br/>
You&#39;re not trying to recreate a school, you&#39;re trying (hopefully) to<br/>
create an environment of trust where learning and joy go hand in hand.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;He is learning multiplication and division so I give him the choice<br/>
of the Twist and Shout Multipication toy or a few lessons in the<br/>
Singapore math workbook. He chooses the workbook.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Again, not much of a choice. Why does he need to &quot;learn multiplication<br/>
and division&quot; right now? I would venture to guess that he&#39;s memorizing<br/>
some stuff to placate you, not really learning it because he&#39;s<br/>
fascinated and asking.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;Then he spends 30 minutes in his room reading something other than<br/>
Captain Underpants and old Looney Tunes comic books - I think he chose<br/>
one of the Secret of Droon books.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
At this list, you&#39;ll hear a lot of us tell  you to value anything and<br/>
everything he loves, including Captain Underpants and old Looney Tunes<br/>
comic books. If that&#39;s all he reads and he&#39;s happy, then he&#39;s<br/>
learning.  Try to let go of the preconceived notions about what is<br/>
valuable and not valuable and realize that if it matters to your<br/>
child, it MATTERS.<br/>
Trusting our children is often the most simple thing AND the biggest<br/>
challenge we have to face. Trust. It&#39;s really the crux of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Btw, welcome to the list....I hope you find a lot of good information<br/>
for your journey.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1493635544">Just had to search...<br/>
<br/>
My daughter (13 months)  got a late birthday present yesterday - the drop a<br/>
roar dragon from fisher-price and my son (five 1/2) asked to play with the<br/>
box it came in. Of course, I said yes because boxes are great for the<br/>
imagination. There isn&#39;t a more open ended toy, is there?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, he spent sometime making it a house and then trying to climb in it<br/>
right side up. Mind you the box comes up past his waist. Finally he does it<br/>
and proceeds to scoot across the floor only looses his balance and falls -<br/>
slowly backwards. Flat on his back he says &quot;I&#39;m alright- I&#39;m alright&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I proceed to laugh and he says &quot;Mom, I love when you laugh.&quot; Going back to<br/>
trying to upright himself again. Which as I write this he does, scoots<br/>
again, tries to sit down in it, in the process tears a whole out for his<br/>
feet.<br/>
<br/>
He gets out and stomps on the box saying he has defeated the box! Now he is<br/>
passing toys from the top to through the whole.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1720372651">You know,<br/>
We&#39;re still trying to undo the whole asking permission deal. It&#39;s  <br/>
hard for everyone because it&#39;s been instilled since birth! My husband  <br/>
totally doesn&#39;t like that it&#39;s changing. He hates giving up control  <br/>
(I think it&#39;s really he doesn&#39;t like things to change). I feel awful  <br/>
whenever one of the kids comes up and asks if they can do this or  <br/>
that. Or have this or that. We&#39;re still deschooling, altho i can&#39;t  <br/>
really blame schooling for that, it&#39;s all me.<br/>
<br/>
Josh loves to read all night. One thing, it&#39;s quieter (we do have  <br/>
nine people in our house, there&#39;s  a lot of noise associated with  <br/>
that many youngsters) and for another, night owlery runs in the  <br/>
family. I come from a long line of third shift workers. :-)  <br/>
Unfortunately it doesn&#39;t seem to kick in until they&#39;re six or so,  <br/>
because the toddlers usually are up before the sun.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1795800632">I love this!<br/>
<br/>
I just came in from outside with my nearly 4 yr old daughter and 2 yr<br/>
old son. They played in the sandbox, using their boomwhackers as sand<br/>
conduits and pillars. My daughter spent alot of time going up the<br/>
slide with buckets of sand sprinkling it down and saying it was<br/>
angels. Then sliding down with the sand - very fun. We used her<br/>
magnifying glass to check out the cocoon on the playset that we have<br/>
been watching for the last week or so. We then picked oranges and ate<br/>
them (sort of - they were not too good). Now they are watching a<br/>
Thomas dvd. They are obsessed with trains right now.<br/>
<br/>
I am on my way to finish our veggie soup and make some corn bread.<br/>
Then, when they go to bed I plan to read Rue Kream&#39;s book - which I<br/>
just got in the mail today or work on my thesis. Hmmm.... which sounds<br/>
better??<br/>
<br/>
The weather in Florida is amazing right now. All the windows are open,<br/>
the breeze is flowing through my house and I am really calm.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing we do, everytime we go out front is to check out the<br/>
dead corn snake that fell from the sky into our yard the other day.<br/>
Apparently, it fell out of a birds mouth. Too crazy!<br/>

Tristan and I just got back from bowling, and now Tristan is finishing up a sub sandwich and is settling in to play his PS2 (probably Star Wars Battlefront II).  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m reviewing the AK state laws online since I just opened a letter from Tristan&#39;s former school stating that he must be enrolled in either a school or in a state run homeschooling program.  Basically a nasty-gram from the hellhole I pulled him from.  According to everything I&#39;ve read, I don&#39;t have to notify or seek approval from anyone, but I am a bit concerned.  That school would do anything to get Tristan and me in trouble.<br/>

The schools only know one way, the way they&#39;re used to doing things. They&#39;re usually totally unfamiliar with the actual state regs regarding homeschooling. Just take a deep breath and try to relax. Then you can respond to their nasty-gram with an ever so polite letter thanking them for their concern and letting them know how you are painstakingly following all AK homeschooling regs.

 </span></blockquote>We&#39;re glad you&#39;re here. I hope we can give you lots of inspiration. What you&#39;re doing now sounds like a relaxed/eclectic approach to homeschooling. Lots of people I know love that method and can stick with it long term. Many though, get bored or burned out after awhile and look for something else.<br/>
<br/>
This list will talk about unschooling in its most radical form. &lt;g&gt; By that I just mean that many of us have a level of trust with our children and their learning of all things, and that can be a real shift from the norm. Since you say you are bored with what you are doing, you may like the unschooling way more than what you&#39;ve been doing. It will involve a shift in YOUR thinking about education, but it&#39;s so worth it. <br/>

Nope, we haven&#39;t enrolled in any sort of state run homeschooling program and have no intention of doing so (unless the school tries to make things ugly -- doubtful -- and then we&#39;d maybe look into the option of an umbrella school??).  We&#39;re pursuing the option of him being &quot;taught&quot; at home by a parent or guardian.<br/>

Of course an occasional bump or some rapids or piece of unwanted debris may get in your path. That&#39;s okay. Do what you need to to deal with it and then let it float on by. Don&#39;t let it ruin your experience floating down that river. It&#39;s too good to be distracted away from.<br/>
