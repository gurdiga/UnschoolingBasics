<div id="ygrps-yiv-1775866478">Why do you want to do lessons plans?  I&#39;m assuming this activity is meant to<br/>
fulfill a state requirement.  Is that why?  Does your state (if you&#39;re in<br/>
the US) require lesson plans?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1510349618">Constantly thinking about school subjects will hinder your unschooling  <br/>
lives. But, I created a form that might help if you have a need to  <br/>
keep records. It is in the files area of this list at the following  <br/>
link:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/files/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/files/</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It is designed to allow you to keep notes on what is &quot;going on&quot; in  <br/>
your kids&#39; lives, to some degree at least &lt;G&gt;, while NOT forcing you  <br/>
into thinking in terms of school subjects.<br/>
<br/>
For those who need or want to keep records, it can help a lot if you  <br/>
aren&#39;t constantly having to think about what your kids are doing in  <br/>
terms of what school subject it satisfies. With this simple record  <br/>
keeping form, you can think in terms of what they are really doing,  <br/>
and only later, maybe once a month or once a year, translate that into  <br/>
school subjects IF you have to do it for some reason.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-722096146">Hi,<br/>
I&#39;m new in this group and I have two girls, they are almost 4 yo and  <br/>
16 mo. Is there a website or a pdf somewhere that could point me in  <br/>
the direction of what the different states require regarding proof of  <br/>
lesson plans, etc.?<br/>
Also, has anyone ever seen a documentary that covers unschooling? I&#39;m  <br/>
possibly planning on making a documentary as we embark upon this  <br/>
adventure.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-780532373">thanks to everyone that has responded.. I printed that file on the <br/>
group.. it&#39;s goign to help a lot.. and I am in the process of ordering <br/>
these other books on amazon.com.. especially the John Holt Book <br/>
(Learning all the time).. I want to read it but to also let the hubs <br/>
read it.. I am not required by law to provide lesson plans - by chosing <br/>
a &quot;private&quot; homeschool designation.. but I want to learn now how to <br/>
build my daughter&#39;s portfolio for college rather than waiting until <br/>
Middle or highschool age to start.  Also I would like something to show <br/>
my husband as to how what we do thru life learning translates into the <br/>
subjects she would get in public school.. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2076198956">Hi Natalie<br/>
<br/>
Just google &lt;your state&gt; homeschooling and you&#39;ll find the laws for your<br/>
state. Or, are you looking to find someplace to move that has no<br/>
regulations? Tops for no regulation include (in no particular order) CT,<br/>
TX, OK, NJ, AK, ID, IL, IN, MI. Then there are some that require that<br/>
you keep records and/or take tests BUT you never show them to anyone<br/>
UNLESS they formally, in writing, request you to present the material<br/>
(pretty silly). And, there are places like FL where you can use a cover<br/>
or &quot;umbrella&quot; school - enroll with the umbrella school (usually a<br/>
nominal fee) and email them your &#39;attendance&#39; each the month and that&#39;s<br/>
it.<br/>

I hate to be a real party-pooper about this film. I&#39;m sure Peter is a <br/>
wonderful man, and I admire that he made the effort.<br/>
<br/>
But if you are looking for inspiration? Please don&#39;t watch this!<br/>
<br/>
Several of the young adults (they are pretty old now, I&#39;d think) <br/>
are...&quot;dull&quot;---for lack of a more exciting word. The more &quot;academic&quot; <br/>
teens seem at least...&quot;sparkly&quot;---but still....<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not something a reluctant parent/spouse/grandparent would find <br/>
&quot;comforting.&quot; I would never recommend showing this to someone &quot;on the <br/>
fence.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s poorly edited. And waaay too long. And a couple of the kids seem <br/>
really, really sad.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking forward to the upcoming documentary. There&#39;s no doubt we <br/>
need one. But I&#39;d really warn you OFF Grown Without Schooling. I&#39;m glad <br/>
I didn&#39;t see it before I was hooked on unschooling. I probably would <br/>
have had second thoughts about it.<br/>
<br/>
The teens/young adults *I* am used to seeing at the conferences just <br/>
REEK of confidence and excitement and joy and adventure and interests <br/>
and a unique sense of living in the moment. These attributes seemed <br/>
lacking in Grown Without Schooling. I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s <br/>
representable of the teens/young adults *I* know. And consequently the <br/>
*unschooling* that I know.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-957326489">I looked at the previews and what I came away thinking is it didn&#39;t sound<br/>
much like unschooling.  There was one fellow who looked pretty confident who<br/>
appeared twice and I liked what he said.  But yeah... I guess in the<br/>
interest of balance, there seemed to be way more &quot;negative&quot; than I was<br/>
expecting.  I thought I would wait to see what kind of documentary the new<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-141070143">Thanks for your insights, Kelli! I just watched the trailer and I felt  <br/>
the same way. I would want to show the inspiration and enthusiasm that  <br/>
children can feel when they learn about life and how the world works.  <br/>
&quot;Inspiration&quot; is the key here for me, breathing spirit into life...  <br/>
also exploring what kills enthusiasm for learning and what happens to  <br/>
kids in a rigid school environment.<br/>
My kids are quite young, almost 4 and 16 months and I&#39;m just learning  <br/>
about unschooling myself. I wish I could come to the conference in  <br/>
Sept., but it&#39;s pretty far, we are in SF.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I felt pretty much the same when I watched it.  I too, thought that <br/>
some of them appeared sad.  I was very new to unschooling at the <br/>
time, so it had quite an impact on me.  I felt pretty depressed for <br/>
awhile, actually.  I finally concluded that the filmmaker was perhaps <br/>
a bit down himself and chose to edit the film with that slant.  So, I <br/>
chose to ignore it and hold onto unchooling for a little bit longer, <br/>
even if it required some blind faith.  I reasoned that my kids were <br/>
already bubbly and interesting, so why should I fear that unschooling <br/>
would somehow suck them dry and make them dull or depressed.  <br/>
Luckily, my DH would neither read nor watch anything about <br/>
unschooling when we first started.  Otherwise, we may easily have <br/>
been doing something else entirely.<br/>
<br/>
As a side note (I just love to tell this story), my DH may not have <br/>

I don&#39;t know. Just what they said and how they acted.<br/>
<br/>
Uninspired. Dull. Uninterested.<br/>

Just not my children&#39;s reality.<br/>

I had the same problem.. couldn&#39;t hear the content.  But from what I <br/>

One of the differences is that several of these young adults didn&#39;t <br/>
have parental support or encouragement when they were teens. The two <br/>
&quot;academic&quot; types *were* supported, but they were...&quot;academic.&quot; The poor <br/>
cyclist was NOT at ALL! His story was sooo depressing to me.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a couple (maybe they&#39;re married, I can&#39;t remember), but they <br/>
didn&#39;t seem to have any &quot;oomph&quot; at all. Then there&#39;s one girl who lives <br/>
in a tiny house on her parents&#39; land and grows plants and never does <br/>
much else---and she seems very depressed.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just not a joyful, inspirational view of unschooled adults. The <br/>
teens/young adults *I* know are articulate, interested, interesting, <br/>
engaged in life, adventurous, philosophical---just AMAZING!<br/>
<br/>
Ruthless editing *might* have helped this documentary, but sparkly <br/>
subjects would have helped more!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-908240620">Well Kelly I&#39;m glad to get your party pooper comments.  I have been feeling<br/>
like the only party pooper amongst many who don&#39;t understand my poopin&#39;<br/>
ideas.  ;)  In cocoon mode for the moment and doing a lot of organizing with<br/>
crappy encouragement but such is life at times.  Karl comes first, and in<br/>
order for that to happen first I gotta get things lined up and arranged for<br/>
happier times.  Winter is on the way for pity&#39;s sake and I want to be<br/>
prepared for it.  The last thing I want is a droopy sad cold dull<br/>
sparkle-less winter.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1159184672">Courtney, I usually sit down at the end of the day and type a <br/>
narrative of what Connor does each day. I print it out and place it <br/>
in a binder. It usually takes me about ten minutes a day.  It also <br/>
serves as our &quot;attendance record&quot;. We have our own little discussion <br/>
of what he feels he accomplished and, he rates himself.  We do set <br/>
weekly &quot;goals&quot; but they are his own and are project-oriented. <br/>
