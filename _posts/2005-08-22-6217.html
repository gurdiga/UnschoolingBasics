<div id="ygrps-yiv-1164153337">&quot; I&#39;m not sure <br/>
why it&#39;s needed to state that the abuser is a Christian.  It seems <br/>
irrelivant what faith the *abuser* may or may not be.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Because as a strong political group, as the only faith *I* know <br/>
about that loudly proclaims their God given right to use corporal <br/>
punishment and believes God has INSTRUCTED them to hit, as a world <br/>
religion that advocates control over children, they WANT to be <br/>
recognized as separate and true Christians.<br/>
<br/>
Being Christian doesn&#39;t make you a spanker, at the same time, there <br/>
is LOADS of information out there about how you are ignoring GOD if <br/>
you don&#39;t advocate the use of a rod or corporal punishment.<br/>
<br/>
I have a large segment of my family that is Christian and believe <br/>
strongly in gentle parenting. Even the older generation of my <br/>
Christian believing family advocate non-spanking.<br/>
<br/>
BUT, there is a very powerful body of Christians that speak out <br/>
loudly and strongly encouraging parents to maintain &quot;control&quot; and <br/>
keep parenting in their toolbox. It&#39;s pretty yucky stuff.<br/>
<br/>
As a lifelong Christian until a few years ago, as a member of a <br/>
religious group that quietly advocated spanking, as someone that has <br/>
extensively studied the Bible, the history of Christianity and other <br/>
religions, I can emphatically state that Christians have one of the <br/>
worst track records in that area.<br/>
It&#39;s changing. I have high hopes that the younger generations will <br/>
change the face of Christianity..I hope.  <br/>
<br/>
If you live in an area of the world where Christians are by and <br/>
large gentle, tolerant folks, just read here for an eye opener. I <br/>
live in the South btw, and there is more of the rabid type down here.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, folks spank in every walk of life, but not every group is <br/>
encouraging it&#39;s other members to spank and hit.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s some food for thought:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.myfortress.org/spank_children.html">http://www.myfortress.org/spank_children.html</a><br/>
&quot;One evangelical leader writes:<br/>
&quot;Scripture itself prescribes corporal discipline and cautions <br/>
parents not to abandon the use of the rod.  The opinions of self-<br/>
proclaimed experts who disagree frankly amount to little.  In the <br/>
end, the facts will be found to agree with the Word of God...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bible.com/answers/aspankin.html">http://www.bible.com/answers/aspankin.html</a><br/>
&quot;Proverbs 23:13-14: &quot;Withold not discipline from the child, for if <br/>
you strike and punish him with the (reed-like) rod, he will not die. <br/>
Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from <br/>
hell.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
First of all, discipline of children should begin at an early age, <br/>
whenever a child begins to defy the parent. Remember the old <br/>
saying, &quot;He who spares the rod, spoils the child.&quot; Notice that the <br/>
Bible says that all children have foolishness in their hearts.  The <br/>
Bible definition of a fool means one who is a rebel, so this is <br/>
saying that all children have rebellion in them and when it <br/>
surfaces, it is our duty as parents to drive it out of them.  We are <br/>
to do this by punishing them with a whack on the buttocks with a <br/>
small reed-like rod. This rod could be a switch from a fruit tree <br/>
branch or a willow tree branch or a small wooden spoon. It is not to <br/>
be a large heavy rod or anything that would cause permanent physical <br/>
damage.   The purpose of a spanking is not to cause any lasting <br/>
bodily harm, but to cause spiritual correction.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s loads of this stuff out there. There are also Christians <br/>
advocating gentle parenting these days. But if you hear about a <br/>
spanking Christian, that&#39;s why.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-197102347">I can understand some of the confusion on what &quot;Christians&quot; believe. <br/>
It&#39;s amazing how much even some of the most Devout christians veer off<br/>
from the teachings of the bible.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone hear about Pat Robertson&#39;s latest?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 Yesterday on the Christian Broadcast Network, Robertson said the U.S.<br/>
is able to &quot;take out&quot; Chavez and &quot;the time has come that we exercise<br/>
that ability.&quot; He also said Chavez threatens the U.S. with communism<br/>
and Muslim extremism.<br/>
