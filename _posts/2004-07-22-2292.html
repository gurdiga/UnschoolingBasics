<div id="ygrps-yiv-156843528">First, as a fairly new person to this list, I just<br/>
want to say that I am enjoying all the posts on this<br/>
list and am learning alot!<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I must admit that I do have some residual<br/>
&quot;anti-tv/video&quot; feelings, although not that extreme,<br/>
which I am currently processing.  My child is not<br/>
quite 3, my second just turned 1, and am trying to<br/>
find the right balance that feels good for our family-<br/>
perhaps I should be more concerned with the balance<br/>
that feels good to my almost 3 year old.  My circle of<br/>
friends are very alternative and I find their<br/>
parenting philosophies very valuable.  At the same<br/>
time, I am discovering unschooling, which challenges<br/>
me to go even further!  I am happy to let Sebastian<br/>
watch videos (we currently have no cable, therefore no<br/>
tv channels), but, I often stuggle with my partner&#39;s<br/>
negative comments about Sebastian &quot;watching too much<br/>
so we just ignore him&quot; (he&#39;s being cynical here), and<br/>
my alternative friends commenting that the wave<br/>
lengths omitted from the tv have negative effects on<br/>
children&#39;s brains.  (Any info about this argument<br/>
would be helpful!)  I&#39;m NOT concerned at all that my<br/>
children will not read due to tv watching.  I&#39;m an<br/>
English major and love literature myself- so I just<br/>
don&#39;t see this happening...<br/>
Anyhow, I have a love for film, so definately see<br/>
movies etc. as having an artistic as well as<br/>
educational as well as entertainment etc. etc. value.<br/>
Perhaps I need to go into the archives and read past<br/>
posts on this topic.<br/>
<br/>
On another note, reading the recent posts about<br/>
unschoolers wanting to go to a military school- I am<br/>
instinctually saddened by reading these posts because<br/>
it hurts me to imagine children wanting to go into<br/>
this field.  War is not play, it&#39;s murder; and I<br/>
wonder how parents feel about this.  I know as an<br/>
unschooler we are supposed to support and encourage a<br/>
child&#39;s interest; so how does a parent deal when what<br/>
a child chooses to be interested in is anti-thetical<br/>
to a parent&#39;s moral philosophy?  I realize this may be<br/>
a touchy subject due to the war in Iraq and other<br/>
controversial wars, but feel like I need to come to a<br/>
place of understanding.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the insight,<br/>
Jennefer in Oregon<br/>

 <br/>
I&#39;m anti-war, but I&#39;m married to an Air Force major, ret. Ben is the  <br/>
gentlest, most peaceful person I know----and many on this list know him  too.The <br/>
point of the military is to avoid war. Doesn&#39;t always happen, of  course. Ben&#39;s in <br/>
because he feels that he can steer folks to more peaceful  resolutions. He <br/>
joined for several reasons, but he&#39;s anti-war too. A military  full of hotheaded <br/>
killers is NOT what a military needs. <br/>
 <br/>
I doubt many unschoolers will find themselves in the military---it&#39;s just  <br/>
counter to what unschooling endorses---critical thinking. Of course, we  NEED <br/>
very smart, critical thinkers in the higher ranks!  And they  have to start <br/>
somewhere! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

but then I read a lot of posts at the UnschoolingDiscussion list that <br/>
had links stating that that book was full o&#39;crap and that the <br/>
reports/experiments/tests had been rigged or twisted to look like TV, <br/>
computer, video use was just pure danger.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, I don&#39;t have those links, but you could probably turn up <br/>
some if you put that title into <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a> with some other <br/>
words.  Somebody here might have the links bookmarked or you could join <br/>
the UnschoolingDiscussion Yahoo group and search the archives.<br/>
<br/>
Either way, we&#39;re pretty &quot;alternative&quot;/&quot;crunchy&quot; but we&#39;ve let go of <br/>
our hang ups about limiting exposure to TV and/or computer and the kids <br/>
don&#39;t have melted brains and they are getting kind of bored with it now <br/>
that they&#39;ve &quot;gorged&quot; themselves on it for a few months.<br/>

<br/>
Jennefer, is this a fact or is it your belief? Here&#39;s why I&#39;m asking.<br/>
<br/>
I was raised in a community with certain political etc. beliefs that <br/>
were treated as facts. People who believed overwise were wrong and/or <br/>
evil. As I became a teenager, I started seeing the holes, the places <br/>
where the &#39;facts&#39; weren&#39;t true. It was hard to talk to my parents or <br/>
others about it because they didn&#39;t say &quot;here&#39;s what I believe and <br/>
why&quot; and let me choose as much as they repeated their facts! Other <br/>
people believe that war is a necessary evil or that serving in the <br/>
military is defending their country, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d always assumed values are something we would teach our <br/>
children...now I&#39;m struggling to understand how we are going to share <br/>
our values, explain what we believe, etc. without Teaching Right and <br/>
Wrong in Three Short Lessons! I know that I can&#39;t control whether my <br/>
kids join the military like dh or become anti-war protesters or <br/>
anywhere in between. There are issues I feel strongly about and <br/>
issues dh feels strongly about (and they ain&#39;t the same!). <br/>
<br/>
I think that explaining beliefs and listening to our kids&#39; questions <br/>
and allowing them to explore other view points is vital. Why should <br/>
they listen to us if we don&#39;t listen to them? <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just a very long-winded way of saying I don&#39;t know either! <br/>
