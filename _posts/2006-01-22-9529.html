<div id="ygrps-yiv-574920227">&quot;He was just<br/>
wondering about the best wya to help them into that<br/>
transition if it was somethin they liked. I did look<br/>
up the Goddard school that someone posted and I think<br/>
that looks awsome esp with the classes they can take<br/>
at an earlier age. I will defintally show him that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Wes Beach spoke at the Live and Learn conference about creative ways<br/>
of documentation for helping unschoolers get into college. I heard it<br/>
was REALLY good. I know Pam and others with college attendees have<br/>
lots of good information too, but his CD is available at<br/>
liveandlearnconference.org if you think that might reassure both of you.<br/>
<br/>
There are several families around here with college attending<br/>
unschoolers that are doing fabulous with their choice. <br/>

is the type to over analyze a lot of things. Wanting<br/>
the best for our kids. Which of course I do to but he<br/>
worries about it more then I do. I see my oldest just<br/>
picking up things left and right everyday and just<br/>
know in my heart that he will be just fine. DH on the<br/>
other hand needs some sort of proof that he will be ok<br/>
and we are not a bunch of wack-a-doos. :)<br/>

Some unschooling guru said that no one has any proof that their kids are  <br/>
going to turn out OK.   I guess the disadvantage of unschooling is  that we can&#39;t <br/>
depend on or blame the school or packaged curriculum.  And  maybe the real <br/>
point is that we don&#39;t have that perceived safety net.<br/>
 <br/>
Everyone  I know complains about their co-workers or other people they  do <br/>
business with.  The world if chock-a-block full of school &quot;success  stories&quot;!!!! <br/>
 I don&#39;t see how even the whack-a-doos we are raising are  going to be less <br/>
OK than everyone else.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1755258678">It depends on what he wants from college at the time. There are many online<br/>
colleges that are reputable, tech schools and yes there are even<br/>
&quot;traditional&quot; colleges that teach in a unschooling fashion.<br/>
<br/>
You could also visit some local colleges and he can ask questions of the<br/>
college faculty. <br/>

I&#39;m glad we switched! <br/>
We are now safer and healthier, using toxic-free products and saving money,<br/>
too.<br/>
