<div id="ygrps-yiv-1381552981">Yesterday we headed to the dollar store, Breanna was needing  <br/>
something so we picked up some McD&#39;s french fries and went shopping.  <br/>
She picked out some coloring books, but suddenly I remembered  <br/>
something I read online here, (and I&#39;m crossposting because I know it  <br/>
was one of these groups, but don&#39;t recall which, and plus it&#39;s so  <br/>
cool that maybe someone else could try it). So I picked up a CASE of  <br/>
the glowsticks. It was maybe $10 altogether.<br/>
<br/>
We came home, grilled out, sat out and played cards (FLUXX and  <br/>
WaterWorks) for a while, and after everyone was ready to transition,  <br/>
I suggested maybe it would feel good to swim (honestly, 100 degrees  <br/>
today and too hot to swim in the afternoon! 80 degrees at ten pm last  <br/>
night, and it felt wonderful!) It&#39;s just odd enough, because usually  <br/>
I&#39;m hesitant to get them swimming so late, cranky neighbors, hard to  <br/>
see, I&#39;m exhausted....So while they jumped in, I ran inside, got my  <br/>
swimsuit and opened up all those glow sticks. In the pool, I cracked  <br/>
them all open and started quietly distributing them around the pool.  <br/>
THe girls were THRILLED. We had so much fun swimming around diving  <br/>
for sticks. The girls experimented with placing them in different  <br/>
areas and distribution, and we all agreed that we need to have a  <br/>
party and invite everyone over to swim late at night.<br/>
<br/>
It was so beautiful to see their happiness and contentment shining in  <br/>
pool late at night. The soft glow through the water was enough to  <br/>
light their faces, and they were happy to be out and playing games  <br/>
with dad and mom. We floated in the noodle chairs and watched  <br/>
lightening bugs. We counted stars and adopted some as our own. We all  <br/>
gathered around Avari in her baby floatie and laughed as she splashed  <br/>
her way around to try and get the floating glow sticks. Rachel  <br/>
learned to dive under water so she could catch as many as Emily was  <br/>
getting.<br/>
<br/>
I took the big plunge with unschooling, and I&#39;m still finding little  <br/>
things I didn&#39;t realize I was ruining for everyone. We stayed up  <br/>
swimming until midnight. The little ones got out on their own and  <br/>
climbed into bed as they got tired. i was surprised to come in and  <br/>
see them down. Josh had stayed inside to play video games, and he  <br/>
helped settle Dan into bed with kisses and storytime. :-) He&#39;s so  <br/>
helpful...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I might blog it later, I&#39;m still tired and maybe not  <br/>
verbalizing well how cool it was. Even if you have a wading pool, it  <br/>
would be cool. We were also talking about how it would be fun to use  <br/>
the necklace length ones and tape them onto our homemade water park....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1835905335">And, if you have a Pat Catans around you (I&quot;m not sure if they are only in<br/>
Ohio or not---but they are a large craft store, like Michaels) they have the<br/>
cases of 100 glow sticks for $7.00 or you can get the extra long ones, 6 to<br/>
a pack for $1.00.  I stocked up on like $15 of them and took them to the<br/>
fireworks.  When the guys came around with the $6.00 glowstick necklaces and<br/>
the kids started begging, I pulled out our 150 glowsticks that I got for the<br/>
price of 2  1/2 at the fireworks and said, HAVE FUN!!!  Some kids came by<br/>
and asked where we got so many and we gave them some, too.  Walking back the<br/>
1/2 mile to the car, our kids were decked out in glow stick necklaces,<br/>
headbands, bracelets, ankle braclets and more---they looked really cool!<br/>
What fun that was!<br/>
