<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would word it as make their own choices since regulate implies adhering to<br/>
a some standard decided by someone else.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter won&#39;t make the same choices I will. What I do is live my values<br/>
and provide a safe environment for her to explore in. She trusts I&#39;ll give<br/>
her good information but treats it as information rather than directives of<br/>
what to do. We&#39;ve talked about nutrition so she&#39;s knows that there&#39;s more<br/>
her body needs in an apple than a bag of chips but she doesn&#39;t fear a bag of<br/>
chips.<br/>
<br/>
She can ask for anything she wants from the grocery store. Then I provide<br/>
healthy food and make it as easy or easier to grab than snacky stuff (or at<br/>
least try to remember to!).<br/>
<br/>
Rather than dividing up the world into good and bad, she divides it up into<br/>
interested in and not interested in (yet). When nothing is forbidden, things<br/>
aren&#39;t nearly as intriguing as people fear! My daughter could subsist on a<br/>
diet of Jolt Cola and chips and switch between mature-content TV programs<br/>
and gory, sexual video games. But she doesn&#39;t. That&#39;s because she chooses<br/>
what interests her and avoids what doesn&#39;t interest her.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How can I find other unschoolars in my area?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Go to Google (http://www.google.com) and paste into the search:<br/>
<br/>
tennessee OR TN unschool OR unschooler OR unschoolers OR unschooling<br/>
<br/>
(the ORs need to be capitalized so Google reads them as a command rather<br/>
than as a word to search for.)<br/>
<br/>
Also check at places that appeal to alternative lifestyle folks like food<br/>
coops and health food stores. Check with the librarian and library bulletin<br/>
board. If none of those pan out, put up flyers of your own in the above<br/>
places to invite unschoolers to a get together.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1831885427">Well, world-wide, breastfeeding usually takes place<br/>
for 4-7 years.  It&#39;s just here in the good ol&#39; US<br/>
where we&#39;re freaked about our breasts that the average<br/>
is under a year.<br/>
<br/>
I know it seems strange, if you haven&#39;t been there. <br/>
But when you never stop it never gets to be strange. <br/>
When she was 4, 6 sounded strange, but now it doesn&#39;t<br/>
;)  She&#39;s just not done yet!  And I&#39;m one of these<br/>
brazen fling-a-breast-out-anywhere moms, sometimes two<br/>
;) so I&#39;m sure that has something to do with it, but<br/>
really she and I haven&#39;t done much nursing in public<br/>
since she was about 3.  It&#39;s just sweet time that we<br/>
spend together in bed in the morning and before we<br/>
fall asleep at night, and throughout the day when she<br/>
thinks of it, which over the years is less and less...<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s ok that you ask :)<br/>

Dana is right if I wasn&#39;t BF I&#39;d probably think it strange to be BF such an &#39;old&#39; child but when you never stop it&#39;s just natural.  Seeing my dd cuddled up nursing and clearly enjoying it puts a smile on my face every time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-796966729">Hi AnnMarie,<br/>
<br/>
As an extended breastfeeding Mom whose 5 1/2 yr old appears at this point to<br/>
have decided she&#39;s done the last few months, and who is still nursing a 3.4<br/>
yr old, I&#39;d be happy to share my thoughts on this and personally I&#39;m not<br/>
offended by your comments.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;ve found in examining my own experience and listening to the<br/>
experiences of many other breastfeeding moms is that everyone&#39;s experience<br/>
and everyone&#39;s kids needs are different, so I&#39;m personally not all that big<br/>
on &quot;extended breastfeeding theory&quot; that is somehow supposed to apply to<br/>
everyone.  What I can say is that my own experience has been that it has<br/>
felt important and fulfilling to me to meet the nursing needs of my kids,<br/>
who have expressed a tremendous need to nurse that has carried over until<br/>
they are older than what is the accepted societal norm here in the U.S.<br/>
(which you may be interested to know is much different than the norm in<br/>
other countries where the average weaning age is much higher and societal<br/>
acceptance of that much greater).  Other than the usual soreness and pain at<br/>
the beginning of nursing, I have not experienced the ongoing pain that you<br/>
described - sometimes that type of pain is due to improper positioning or<br/>
improper latch on by the baby, but I do know that my sister experienced many<br/>
months of pain with the nursing of her first daughter even with a lot of<br/>
support and info on proper positioning and so forth from la leche and a<br/>
private nursing consultant, so partly I think that if you got the latch on<br/>
and positioning correct, then women&#39;s bodies are just different.  Also,<br/>
babies nurse differently.  My daughter was a polite kind of gentle nurser<br/>
and my son was a &quot;barracuda&quot; nurser who was much rougher and at one point<br/>
tore my nipple on one side in several places - so I did go through a lot of<br/>
different things with him teaching him to be more gentle, which he now is.<br/>
<br/>
The benefits my kids get in my eyes with extended breastfeeding are they are<br/>
still getting the antibodies that help them not get sick from my breastmilk<br/>
(they have been insanely healthy), they are getting the incredible comfort<br/>
factor when they are scared or hurt, we all get the ongoing bonding benefits<br/>
of it, and it is a fabulous calming down tool which is such a benefit for<br/>
both them and me - my son is three now and we are going through many daily<br/>
tantrums over all that he wants to do exactly the way he wants it all by<br/>
himself when that doesn&#39;t happen - and &quot;num num&quot; is a way he can choose to<br/>
break the escalating cycle of upset, reconnect and regroup.  Sometimes he<br/>
chooses other options, but it is his favorite one.  There are also plenty of<br/>
kids that decide they are done quite early, and I wouldn&#39;t encourage my kids<br/>
to nurse past when they felt they were done!  It is something I find I can<br/>
provide to them that they express to me that they need.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I&#39;ve been through several periods when I was tandem nursing both<br/>
of them, when I needed to honor and discuss my own needs with them and work<br/>
out limits to the nursing - when my nipple was torn and I was only nursing<br/>
on one side for a while I negotiated with my older one to nurse less since<br/>
it was a killer on my one breast that was functioning.  And there was a<br/>
period when my son was one and my daughter was three and the combined amount<br/>
they wanted to nurse was more than I could handle.  I decided it was more<br/>
important to try to nurse my daughter as long as she wanted, as opposed to<br/>
as much as she wanted right at that point, so I talked to her and we worked<br/>
out limits to her nursing until we got to the point where her demands were<br/>
not exceeding my ability to do it.  I have seen my sister be unable to do<br/>
this with her daughter, resulting in her increased frustration and inability<br/>
to continue nursing at all, so I felt it was important to listen to my own<br/>
needs and figure out what would work best for all of us together, which at<br/>
that point was not my daughter nursing every time she wanted.<br/>
<br/>
One last word on feeling embarrassed.  We live in a culture in this country<br/>
that unfortunately fosters that feeling.  I have battled it myself,<br/>
particularly as my kids have gotten older.  I have realized that it was<br/>
important for me both to put the needs of my kids over my embarassment, but<br/>
also to try to do what I could to make that easier on myself.  With an older<br/>
child asking to nurse in public, a lot of times you can negotiate for doing<br/>
it later unless it&#39;s an emergency.  If my older child asked because she was<br/>
hurt or upset then I would nurse her on the spot, perhaps taking a minute to<br/>
find, if possible, a more private way to do it if that made me more<br/>
comfortable.  I actually have not encountered that much disapproval of my<br/>
extended nursing, most of it has just been dealing with my own fear of that<br/>
which has gotten easier as time has gone on and I&#39;ve logged in a lot of<br/>
nursing miles and surrounded myself with other like minded folks who have<br/>
made me feel comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
Wow, that was long.  You got me on one of my favorite subjects!  Hope that<br/>
speaks to what you are wondering about...<br/>
<br/>

weekend...Emma was tired, we were on vacation, and she<br/>
was trying to sit us and friends at a table...and we<br/>
just weren&#39;t doing it right, despite our best efforts,<br/>
and she just had a melt down...We were in a corner<br/>
booth, and after a lot of soothing and talking, the<br/>
&quot;moo&quot; was the only thing that was going to do the<br/>
trick...after a few minutes all was right with the<br/>
world and she went off to play for another hour with<br/>
the kids.  So I say I don&#39;t nurse in public anymore,<br/>
but what I really mean is I have gotten more discrete<br/>
as she&#39;s gotten older...Although, I haven&#39;t had any<br/>
bad experiences, and actually until 5 yo she had two<br/>
friends her age that also nursed, and we would<br/>
sometimes just all hang out and nurse and play  :)<br/>

First, this is not normal. The first thing that jumps into my head is thrush. Thrush/yeast can be an insidious little creature, and one needn&#39;t have all the symptoms for it to be an issue. At any rate, I&#39;m sorry you had to deal with pain your entire nursing experience with your youngest. <br/>

 <br/>
Older kids don&#39;t commonly nurse frequently, and they can often understand waiting until one gets home, or to another place where there is more privacy. It is true that our culture doesn&#39;t really allow for nursing beyond a year. My 3 yo nurses every few days. He is easily distracted, i.e. he&#39;s nursing out of habit, is hungry, so asks to nurse. I offer food, and the nursing is forgotten. I think he nursed two days ago, I can&#39;t remember.  My older child, at 3 years nursed a couple of times a day (if I remember right!). Even twice a day though isn&#39;t all that much. <br/>

    I completely agree with you on the sweetness of breast feeding.  Even<br/>
though I had been in pain for the 15 months that I nursed my youngest I<br/>
still cried when I realized that those days of snuggling were over.  Thanks<br/>
so much for being open.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
  Well, world-wide, breastfeeding usually takes place<br/>
  for 4-7 years.  It&#39;s just here in the good ol&#39; US<br/>
  where we&#39;re freaked about our breasts that the average<br/>
  is under a year.<br/>
<br/>
  I know it seems strange, if you haven&#39;t been there.<br/>
  But when you never stop it never gets to be strange.<br/>
  When she was 4, 6 sounded strange, but now it doesn&#39;t<br/>
  ;)  She&#39;s just not done yet!  And I&#39;m one of these<br/>
  brazen fling-a-breast-out-anywhere moms, sometimes two<br/>
  ;) so I&#39;m sure that has something to do with it, but<br/>
  really she and I haven&#39;t done much nursing in public<br/>
  since she was about 3.  It&#39;s just sweet time that we<br/>
  spend together in bed in the morning and before we<br/>
  fall asleep at night, and throughout the day when she<br/>
  thinks of it, which over the years is less and less...<br/>
<br/>
  It&#39;s ok that you ask :)<br/>

    It wasn&#39;t thrush I was dealing with it was the fact that he was holding<br/>
his upper lip stiff.  No matter how many times I would repositions or pull<br/>
the lip out he would stick it right back there and continue on.  I would<br/>
blister and man-o-man was I sore.<br/>
    I was just posting to Dana that even though I was in pain and relieved<br/>
when he stopped I also cried, because I was truly morning the loss of that<br/>
special cuddling.  I know that if he would have wanted to keep breastfeeding<br/>
I would still be working through the pain to give him the closeness he and I<br/>
both needed.<br/>

   Thank you so much for the explanation.  I never was lucky enough to have<br/>
an extended nurser, but it sounds beautiful.  Like I&#39;ve already said in the<br/>

  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Extended Breastfeeding (was I have a few<br/>
Questions)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Hi AnnMarie,<br/>
<br/>
  As an extended breastfeeding Mom whose 5 1/2 yr old appears at this point<br/>
to<br/>
  have decided she&#39;s done the last few months, and who is still nursing a<br/>
3.4<br/>
  yr old, I&#39;d be happy to share my thoughts on this and personally I&#39;m not<br/>
  offended by your comments.<br/>
<br/>
  What I&#39;ve found in examining my own experience and listening to the<br/>
  experiences of many other breastfeeding moms is that everyone&#39;s experience<br/>
  and everyone&#39;s kids needs are different, so I&#39;m personally not all that<br/>
big<br/>
  on &quot;extended breastfeeding theory&quot; that is somehow supposed to apply to<br/>
  everyone.  What I can say is that my own experience has been that it has<br/>
  felt important and fulfilling to me to meet the nursing needs of my kids,<br/>
  who have expressed a tremendous need to nurse that has carried over until<br/>
  they are older than what is the accepted societal norm here in the U.S.<br/>
  (which you may be interested to know is much different than the norm in<br/>
  other countries where the average weaning age is much higher and societal<br/>
  acceptance of that much greater).  Other than the usual soreness and pain<br/>
at<br/>
  the beginning of nursing, I have not experienced the ongoing pain that you<br/>
  described - sometimes that type of pain is due to improper positioning or<br/>
  improper latch on by the baby, but I do know that my sister experienced<br/>
many<br/>
  months of pain with the nursing of her first daughter even with a lot of<br/>
  support and info on proper positioning and so forth from la leche and a<br/>
  private nursing consultant, so partly I think that if you got the latch on<br/>
  and positioning correct, then women&#39;s bodies are just different.  Also,<br/>
  babies nurse differently.  My daughter was a polite kind of gentle nurser<br/>
  and my son was a &quot;barracuda&quot; nurser who was much rougher and at one point<br/>
  tore my nipple on one side in several places - so I did go through a lot<br/>
of<br/>
  different things with him teaching him to be more gentle, which he now is.<br/>
<br/>
  The benefits my kids get in my eyes with extended breastfeeding are they<br/>
are<br/>
  still getting the antibodies that help them not get sick from my<br/>
breastmilk<br/>
  (they have been insanely healthy), they are getting the incredible comfort<br/>
  factor when they are scared or hurt, we all get the ongoing bonding<br/>
benefits<br/>
  of it, and it is a fabulous calming down tool which is such a benefit for<br/>
  both them and me - my son is three now and we are going through many daily<br/>
  tantrums over all that he wants to do exactly the way he wants it all by<br/>
  himself when that doesn&#39;t happen - and &quot;num num&quot; is a way he can choose to<br/>
  break the escalating cycle of upset, reconnect and regroup.  Sometimes he<br/>
  chooses other options, but it is his favorite one.  There are also plenty<br/>
of<br/>
  kids that decide they are done quite early, and I wouldn&#39;t encourage my<br/>
kids<br/>
  to nurse past when they felt they were done!  It is something I find I can<br/>
  provide to them that they express to me that they need.<br/>
<br/>
  That said, I&#39;ve been through several periods when I was tandem nursing<br/>
both<br/>
  of them, when I needed to honor and discuss my own needs with them and<br/>
work<br/>
  out limits to the nursing - when my nipple was torn and I was only nursing<br/>
  on one side for a while I negotiated with my older one to nurse less since<br/>
  it was a killer on my one breast that was functioning.  And there was a<br/>
  period when my son was one and my daughter was three and the combined<br/>
amount<br/>
  they wanted to nurse was more than I could handle.  I decided it was more<br/>
  important to try to nurse my daughter as long as she wanted, as opposed to<br/>
  as much as she wanted right at that point, so I talked to her and we<br/>
worked<br/>
  out limits to her nursing until we got to the point where her demands were<br/>
  not exceeding my ability to do it.  I have seen my sister be unable to do<br/>
  this with her daughter, resulting in her increased frustration and<br/>
inability<br/>
  to continue nursing at all, so I felt it was important to listen to my own<br/>
  needs and figure out what would work best for all of us together, which at<br/>
  that point was not my daughter nursing every time she wanted.<br/>
<br/>
  One last word on feeling embarrassed.  We live in a culture in this<br/>
country<br/>
  that unfortunately fosters that feeling.  I have battled it myself,<br/>
  particularly as my kids have gotten older.  I have realized that it was<br/>
  important for me both to put the needs of my kids over my embarassment,<br/>
but<br/>
  also to try to do what I could to make that easier on myself.  With an<br/>
older<br/>
  child asking to nurse in public, a lot of times you can negotiate for<br/>
doing<br/>
  it later unless it&#39;s an emergency.  If my older child asked because she<br/>
was<br/>
  hurt or upset then I would nurse her on the spot, perhaps taking a minute<br/>
to<br/>
  find, if possible, a more private way to do it if that made me more<br/>
  comfortable.  I actually have not encountered that much disapproval of my<br/>
  extended nursing, most of it has just been dealing with my own fear of<br/>
that<br/>
  which has gotten easier as time has gone on and I&#39;ve logged in a lot of<br/>
  nursing miles and surrounded myself with other like minded folks who have<br/>
  made me feel comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
  Wow, that was long.  You got me on one of my favorite subjects!  Hope that<br/>
  speaks to what you are wondering about...<br/>

  Subject: RE: [unschoolingbasics] I have a few more questions.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I always let my kids chose for themselves, since they<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  on-demand breastfed (well, one still does at 6 you).<br/>
  Of course, when they were first trying new foods they<br/>
  didn&#39;t ask for cheetos, they just grabbed what was on<br/>
  my plate.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Dana,<br/>
     Please don&#39;t take offense to what I am about to say, but I never could<br/>
  understand the extended breastfeeding theory.  I have four children and<br/>
They<br/>
  were done breastfeeding at all around a 1-11/2 years.  I didn&#39;t choose for<br/>
  them to stop, but they became fidgety and annoyed with it.  When the cup<br/>
was<br/>
  introduced they just didn&#39;t want the restrictions that breastfeeding<br/>
  demanded(holding them while they were eating).  I was in pain physically<br/>
  through my entire breastfeeding experience with my youngest and I won&#39;t be<br/>
  afraid to admit that I was relieved when he stopped.  No matter what<br/>
  position or &quot;trick&quot; I used to get more comfortable it was like he was<br/>
  chewing on me and I would crack and bleed.  I went through 15 months of<br/>
  torture, but I let him decide when he wanted to stop.  I never took<br/>
  breastfeeding away from them, but I think personally I would be a little<br/>
  uncomfortable with my oldest son coming to me in the middle of a public<br/>
  gathering and asking to breastfeed.  Truthfully I think it must be my own<br/>
  feeling of being uptight that get in the way.  I was one of those moms who<br/>
  would hide to breastfeed even though I though it was a beautiful thing.<br/>
       Like I said I am not insulting your decision to extend breastfeeding<br/>
  pass the &quot;norm&quot;, but I am curious as to your thoughts behind it.<br/>
