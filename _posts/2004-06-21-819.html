<div id="ygrps-yiv-1196090794">This morning the person who spoke at our Friend&#39;s Church said he always buys<br/>
presents for his kids on Father&#39;s Day because they were the ones who made<br/>
him a father in the first place and because its fun to give kids presents.<br/>
I thought that was cool.  When I asked DH what he would like to do for<br/>
Father&#39;s Day he decided he wanted to take DS on an excursion to Mojave<br/>
airport to watch the launching of the first manned commercial space flight.<br/>
Also cool.  Sometimes I hear unschooling moms talking about the resistance<br/>
they get from their husbands.  My DH has started to &quot;get it&quot; partly because<br/>
he started working from home.  At first all the togetherness made him a<br/>
little nervous.  It&#39;s one thing to talk about the highlights of the day over<br/>
dinner at night.  Quite another to witness it unfold.  But more than the<br/>
watching and participating with the kids, Working from home and having that<br/>
extra measure of control over his own schedule (compared with office work)<br/>
has given him a taste of the freedom we already enjoy at home.  It&#39;s been<br/>
really great to watch. And I can&#39;t wait to get the highlights of the guys&#39;<br/>
trip to Mojave tomorrow night over dinner.<br/>
Peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1767862756">Hi all, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve introduced myself so I thought I&#39;d say step out of<br/>
lurkdom for a minute.<br/>
<br/>
I am Jamye, married 18years to Mark, we have 3 children--16yo dd, 14yo dd, and<br/>
10yo ds.  We have always homeschooled but have slowly relaxed over the years to<br/>
an unschooling way of life.  My kids are still unsure of how it all works. <br/>
They say we&#39;re having &quot;summer vacation&quot;.  I say there is no school year or<br/>
summer vacation we are just living and learning, that&#39;s it.  They heave a sigh<br/>
and say &quot;I know Mom&quot; but I&#39;m not sure they really do yet.  <br/>
<br/>
Currently my oldest daughter is on a 2 and a half week trip to Tibet.  She sent<br/>
me an email talking about the incredible mountains.  I&#39;m really jealous.<br/>
She sometimes &quot;gets&quot; unschooling more than the others I think.  She&#39;ll refer to<br/>
herself as an autodidact.  But she&#39;ll more likely read and do some book work on<br/>
her own too.<br/>
<br/>
My younger daughter is just enjoying some freedom.  She just bought a skate<br/>
board yesterday and is trying to learn how to balance and do a few tricks.<br/>
Sometimes I get more anxious with her.  She is more likely to just want to chat<br/>
with friends, watch movies with friends, go do something with friends.  I&#39;ve<br/>
begun BEGGING for some time with her these days.  But she does like cooking and<br/>
plans and makes supper once a week.  <br/>
<br/>
My son, is usually my easiest to feel like we are &quot;doing SOMEthing&quot;.  He is<br/>
curious about everything and thinks of things I NEVER would.  He has a very<br/>
active imagination.  Yesterday, when we took Dad out for pizza for Father&#39;s<br/>
Day, he said &quot;if a pizza was a band what instrument would be what ingredient&quot;<br/>
that was a fun one to figure out.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, I guess that&#39;s enough to start on.  Who else is here?  What are you guys<br/>
&quot;into&quot; right now?  <br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>
Jamye</div>

    My name is AnnMarie and I post quite a bit, but not so much lately.  I<br/>
have 4 children: daughter(11)goes to public school and 3-sons (11/2, 31/2,<br/>
and 5) All unschooled.<br/>
   Lately we have been spending most of our time outside, because the<br/>
whether has been beautiful.  We are patiently waiting for our last tadpole<br/>
to turn in to a frog, which he doesn&#39;t seem to want to do.  Two years ago<br/>
when I was going the Home school route instead of Unschooling I bought flash<br/>
cards with the presidents on them,(I don&#39;t know why I thought that my then<br/>
three year old would want to know who all these old men were). Keegan found<br/>
them at the bottom of a drawer full of projects and craft supplies and<br/>
decided to check them out. I had presidents everywhere!  I showed him money<br/>
and how some of the presidents were also on money and coins.  He played with<br/>
the presidents all day without me interfering except to answer the question;<br/>
Who is this mom? which I answered with no other explanation, because he<br/>
didn&#39;t ask for more info.  I used to worry about reading skills or lack<br/>
their of, but now I see that the natural progression will be like this<br/>
president thing.  Something will grab his interest and sooner or later he<br/>
will ask me to explain it and I will and that will be that.....<br/>
<br/>
I really love this about Unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Little things happen every day just like this and it never stops amazing me.<br/>
Learning CAN be fun!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1174298929"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;   Well, I guess that&#39;s enough to start on.  Who else is here?  What <br/>
&gt; are you<br/>
&gt; guys &quot;into&quot; right now?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m Joanne, mom to four - I have two older sons, one working and one <br/>
about to enter college, and two younger daughters, 13 (Catherine) and 4 <br/>
(Haley).  I am homeschooling the 13 yo, and this is our first completed <br/>
year.  It&#39;s a commitment that we have for the two middle school years, <br/>
and so far it&#39;s been really worthwhile adventure.   We read skads of <br/>
great books this year and really started to gain a sense of the &quot;global <br/>
planet&quot;, which were my main teaching goals for our first year.  Moving <br/>
into American History next year should be fun here with all the <br/>
interesting sites to visit in New England.  Catherine is getting ready <br/>
to head to camp this weekend, and is very excited about that.  It is <br/>
her third year.  She&#39;ll be gone a month this time!  The first year was <br/>
one week, the second year two weeks, and now we&#39;re really getting <br/>
serious with half the summer!  She loves it, and it&#39;s such a nice break <br/>
for both of us who spend so much time together during the rest of the <br/>
year.  Expands her perspective I think.  She gets enough of mine!  <br/>
She&#39;ll miss her karate time though.  Her entire social life revolves <br/>
around those classes, and they&#39;ve been great for her.<br/>
<br/>
Haley is in Pre-K and loving it.  We do a lot with her at home as well. <br/>
  Haley loves music and singing, as does Catherine.  Neither has shown <br/>
any interest in competitive sports, and both love to draw and color.  <br/>
So I pretty much go where they take me, and I&#39;ve been really enjoying <br/>
the journey.<br/>
<br/>
As for me, well, I am writing a book about all these adventures in <br/>
learning...it may never make the bestseller list, but it may at least <br/>
help us remember the great times and the not-so-great times we&#39;ve had <br/>
in both homeschooling and unschooling for future years.  I am a little <br/>
shy on memory, so I like to get a lot down on paper.  I also like to <br/>
encourage my girls to write.  Catherine is pretty loathe to it!<br/>
<br/>
Aside from that, enjoying gardening and some beautiful weather - warm, <br/>
dry, sunny days that aren&#39;t too hot.  Getting psyched and ready for an <br/>
annual trek out to Nantucket island.  Anyone else heading anywhere on <br/>
holiday?<br/>

<br/>
Here I go out onto a limb.<br/>
<br/>
This is a list for the basics of Unschooling, as I understand.<br/>
<br/>
You clearly love your children and are having a great deal of fun with them.<br/>
<br/>
When are you actually going to start Unschooling?<br/>
