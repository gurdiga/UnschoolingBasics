<div id="ygrps-yiv-2036852064">Hello Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Just wondering -- how anyone else goes about managing the household <br/>
responsibilities while unschooling?  I came across an inspirational <br/>
website by a homeschooling couple with 8 children recently, and <br/>
ordered their book Managers of the Home because I have long felt <br/>
extremely overwhelmed with this facet of life, and have been <br/>
searching for a solution that will bring a more organized home and <br/>
lifestyle, where the things can be found, company can drop in without <br/>
panic, and the finances under control.  <br/>
<br/>
The ideas this family shares in this book make a lot of sense, and I <br/>
have decided to implement a schedule for our family, with a few <br/>
differences.  The authors&#39; family has a set schedule for 6 days of <br/>
the week -- for household tasks, meals, business, baths, play time, <br/>
school time, hobbies, kids&#39;naps, chores, etc.  ALL their time is <br/>
scheduled, for each family member, even infants. <br/>
<br/>
Since we are trying the unschooling path, this seemed much too rigid <br/>
to follow.  No spontaneity!  And no freedom for learning!  So, I <br/>
adapted my schedule to include household tasks, business, and an <br/>
evening routine, since from dinner time on is usually chaos until my <br/>
husband leaves for work at night, and we are never on the same page.  <br/>
I am tweaking a schedule for shopping, errands, library, etc. All of <br/>
this(when followed)is making a positive difference in the state of <br/>
our home and bringing peace, and I am excited about it. <br/>
<br/>
However, at first, when I put the schedule together, I was still <br/>
stressing over kindergarten starting so I thought I would <br/>
schedule &quot;school&quot; time thinking it could be used as time available <br/>
to &quot;spend together&quot;, without a specific agenda (unschooling school <br/>
time, I thought!) Then I of course found out that most of the time <br/>
when the scheduled &quot;school&quot; time came, my girls usually were <br/>
engrossed in their own play or project and didn&#39;t need me to get <br/>
involved, and everything was thrown off. So I have adapted a loose <br/>
overall schedule to allow for spontaneous moments to be available to <br/>
them, based on the way our days naturally flow.<br/>
<br/>
I am finding more and more that the girls (3 & 5yo) are just not <br/>
needing me as much and there are days when they often play for hours <br/>
without asking me for involvement, other than bathroom help, to help <br/>
with a conflict, or for snacks. I just check in on what they are up <br/>
to and sometimes comment, or re-direct inappropriate activites, but <br/>
then am free to go on my merry way.  And I am having a hard time with <br/>
this at this point. It does not seem right to my schooled brain.  We <br/>
are homeschooling -- I should be doing more with them!  We should be <br/>
sitting down together more!  I should not have so much freedom!  They <br/>
should not have so much freedom! They should be doing something <br/>
academically constructive!  I should schedule them too!  <br/>
<br/>
I do have a few things scheduled for them, things that we feel are <br/>
necessary to family life.  Like a morning job for each, and an <br/>
evening job for each.  And a family devotional time in the morning, <br/>
as well as our family evening routine.  It seems to be working out <br/>
well, but I am swinging between content and anxious, as you can see.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe this is not exactly a scheduling issue, but a new unschooler <br/>
issue?  Either way, thanks for listening.  It is great to come here.<br/>

Doesn&#39;t sound anything like our home.<br/>

And your scheduling may prove more and more difficult---and backfire---as  <br/>
the kids get older. <br/>

<br/>
No kidding!<br/>
<br/>
Try this: www.sandradodd.com/chores  for many stories from Unschooling<br/>
households of varying sizes. No $$ to spend either.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;  So, I <br/>
adapted my schedule to include household tasks, business, and an <br/>
evening routine, since from dinner time on is usually chaos until my <br/>

<br/>
Some people need schedules to help them get organized. A schedule is an<br/>
organizational tool. It should never take on a life of its own and supersede<br/>
the needs of the family members. If you are excited, great. It may not be a<br/>
good way to get to Unschooling to necessarily expect the same enthusiasm<br/>
about a schedule from your children.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I am finding more and more that the girls (3 & 5yo) are just not <br/>

<br/>
It sounds like you could benefit from some de-schooling (as all of us who<br/>
were in school once can). These kinds of ideas are residual &quot;schoolthink&quot;,<br/>
as I guess you have intuited.<br/>
www.sandradodd.com/deschooling<br/>
<br/>
In fact check out the whole site about Unschooling. It is a collection of<br/>
many people&#39;s enjoyable and challenging writings over time, as well as<br/>
Sandra&#39;s lucid essays and articles. Also check out the archives here, as<br/>
this particular issue (household management) is a perennial topic.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;I do have a few things scheduled for them, things that we feel are <br/>
necessary to family life.  Like a morning job for each, and an <br/>
evening job for each.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Jayn (4.5) has no scheduled chores. However she often spontaneously offers<br/>
to help, or does something kind and generous for me or dh. Just seconds ago<br/>
she brought me a treat from the kitchen as a surprise. One of the more<br/>
challenging aspects of Unschooling is the constant examination of one&#39;s<br/>
assumptions - such as &quot;scheduling chores is necessary to family life&quot; or the<br/>
concept of &quot;inappropriate activities&quot; that need re-direction. (What do you<br/>
mean by that anyway?)<br/>
<br/>
The true goal of Unschooling is not merely an education for our children. To<br/>
paraphrase Joyce: it is to enhance our relationship with our children so<br/>
that they can blossom into their authentic best selves (Anne calls the<br/>
SHINING). Learning happens (joyfully) along the way because learning is the<br/>
natural activity of the human brain. <br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the journey.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1270146352">Melissa, in a routine, you tend to do the same things every day <br/>
because it works well for you and your family.  A bedtime routine <br/>
can be a great thing when you have little ones who can&#39;t tell time.  <br/>
They know what is to follow because it always happens in that <br/>
order.  A routine is a natural way of doing things.  A schedule is a <br/>
rigid, outside way of putting rules on yourself (and others).  <br/>
Getting ready for bed in a certain order is a routine.  Going to bed <br/>
at a set time is a schedule.  Routines are good and helpful and <br/>
safe.  Schedules are mean and rigid and bad.<br/>
<br/>
***And I am having a hard time with this at this point. It does not <br/>
seem right to my schooled brain. We are homeschooling -- I should be <br/>
doing more with them! We should be sitting down together more! I <br/>
should not have so much freedom!***<br/>
<br/>
If I were you, I would say, &quot;Can I play, too?&quot; and sit down and play <br/>
what they are playing.  Then, when you have something to do, you can <br/>
say, &quot;do you want to do this with me?&quot;.  I love playing with my <br/>
grandson.  He is the funnest, and funniest person I know.  You <br/>
honestly laugh out loud when you talk to him.  I love it when he <br/>
brings his box of blocks over to me and say in his little, tiny, <br/>
tiny Cindy Lou Who voice, &quot;Grammy, do you want to play with my <br/>
toys?&quot; .  It melts my heart.  I missed my own kids play because I <br/>
was doing dishes or other important Mommy stuff that only important <br/>
Mommy&#39;s do.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1999938651">I can&#39;t cut and paste right now, sorry!<br/>
 <br/>
But I want to add to the schedule conversation.  Even though everybody  might <br/>
be on board in a new schedule environment, at some point most everybody  will <br/>
need to be reminded or possibly even coerced to stay on schedule.   That <br/>
means, you, mom!!!<br/>
 <br/>
My relationship with my kids, a primary focus of unschooling, diminishes if  <br/>
I have to police them.  Besides, it is tiring to keep up with what everyone  <br/>
is supposed to do!  That starts to become the focus.<br/>
 <br/>
Not that I don&#39;t wish there was a way to have a tidy house and a joyful,  <br/>
free life....full-time housekeeper, perhaps??  LOL!<br/>

 <br/>
And I am definitely someone is not organized by nature but really <br/>
desires organization!  What I really liked about the book I read was <br/>
that the authors reiterated that the schedule should be a TOOL not a <br/>
TASKMASTER.  So I have been using my household schedule as a guide <br/>
thus far, and not getting to caught up with times.  I am  allowing <br/>
for lots of flexibility, and so far I am still getting much more done <br/>
with less stress.<br/>
<br/>
I knew that scheduling the kids would not work for any of us, but the <br/>
unschooling fears are still there...  I almost immediately saw the <br/>
error of my ways, even though my attempt was only for scheduling  <br/>
focused time together.  I see that it is better to just let that <br/>
happen naturally, and allow room on the schedule for that.<br/>

<br/>
It is a challenge, and the chore issue is one that we have been re-<br/>
examining for awhile. We have loosened our views quite a bit, for <br/>
example to make toy clean-up a family responsibility instead of a <br/>
requirement for the kids (used to use a timer).  We do ask them to be <br/>
involoved and help them by handing them things, etc. but are really <br/>
trying to keep it positive.  The girls put their clothes away after <br/>
we had a family meeting and I said that I cannot keep up with putting <br/>
the laundry away, and they agreed to help with the situation.  I <br/>
bought them their own small baskets, and they have been cheerful <br/>
about it. We asked them to help with feeding the animals for the same <br/>
reason, and they have been helpful in remembering the task, plus they <br/>
seem to be bonding more with the animals since. We do feel that the <br/>
assigned &quot;jobs&quot; (we don&#39;t call them chores) are fine as long as the <br/>
kids are in agreement to the responsibility, and we are not tyrants <br/>
about it. If the girls forget or resist, we just *do it for them*.  <br/>
We talk about the fact that we as a family have a responsibilty to <br/>
care for what God has given us and help each other in doing so, but <br/>
we are by no means legalistic.  The &quot;inappropriate activities&quot; would <br/>
be things like making a swimming pool for Barbies with real water in <br/>
the middle of the living room carpet (re-directed to kitchen floor), <br/>
or seeing if the newly caught frog likes living in the toilet (re-<br/>
directed to setting up terrarium).  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248614371">One thing that I do that works for us is to keep a &quot;TO DO&quot; list on <br/>
the marker board in my bedroom.  I have a large dry erase board <br/>
hanging just inside my bedroom door.  I keep important things on <br/>
there that we need to remember, shows that we don&#39;t want to miss, <br/>
phone numbers that we need, what we want to accomplish in a day, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Each day, or so, I write what I would like to accomplish.  That way <br/>
I don&#39;t have to think about it or remember it in my head.  If I get <br/>
it accomplished I cross it off.  If not, I keep it there until the <br/>
next day.  I even keep a small marker board on the kitchen counter <br/>
that lets everyone know what&#39;s for dinner, and we use it for <br/>
important messages.<br/>
<br/>
Adrian, he is 10, has a similar personality to mine.  He actually <br/>
requested to make a &quot;reminder list&quot; to hang in his bedroom.  He has <br/>
a kitten and gerbil that he takes care of, so that&#39;s on there.  He <br/>
even likes to be reminded that he needs to take a shower, make his <br/>
bed, etc.  These are HIS ideas.  He&#39;s a neat freak and very <br/>
organized all on his own.  He even likes me to make him a list of <br/>
things to do, that he helps to come up with, on the marker board if <br/>
I am going to be gone for any length of time.  When I know I have to <br/>
leave I ask if he wants a list.  The choice is his.<br/>
<br/>
I just thought I&#39;d share the idea of list making as compared to <br/>
scheduling.  There seems to be a lot of freedom in a list.  <br/>
It&#39;s &quot;just&quot; a list after all...<br/>
<br/>
Keep enjoying the journey. It only gets better and better...<br/>

Thanks for clearing up that question, and clarifying what you mean by<br/>
&quot;redirection&quot; - LOL. This is another illustration of how describing real<br/>
situations is one of the most helpful tools for explaining unschooling<br/>
working.<br/>
<br/>
I will just add that while ever there are &quot;assigned jobs&quot;, no matter how<br/>
cheerfully agreed to, the surprise of the spontaneous and unassigned<br/>
assistance is less likely to blossom. <br/>

Progress not perfection.<br/>
