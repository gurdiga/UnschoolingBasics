<div id="ygrps-yiv-1843577616">I surprised the gang the other day with a new game from Cranium called <br/>
&quot;Zooreka&quot; and I have to say that it is awesome!  We (3, 6, 8 and <br/>
parents) had a blast and it is ranked one of our top games and that says <br/>
a lot because we love games and have quite a few.  You collect food, <br/>
animal and shelter cards to trade in for habitats and you need four <br/>
habitats to win.  You name your zoo when you&#39;re done.  My kids love Zoo <br/>
Tycoon on the computer so this was a love at first play!  We even tend <br/>
to buy a majority of cooperative games but this one is fun for everyone <br/>
even if you don&#39;t win.  We still let the kids who didn&#39;t win create the <br/>
rest of their zoos afterward. <br/>
<br/>
A winner in our house and cost $14.96 at Wal Mart.<br/>
