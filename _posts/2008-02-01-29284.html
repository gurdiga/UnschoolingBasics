<div id="ygrps-yiv-1881677187">This quote is from a different list I&#39;m on:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I remember about a month after I started reading a bunch of parenting <br/>
books<br/>
( The No Cry Sleep Solution, lots of Dr. Sears books. I was two months<br/>
pregnant with our oldest.) DH said he hadn&#39;t really thought being a <br/>
parent<br/>
was something you had to study for. You just did what your own parents <br/>
did.<br/>
We discussed our own childhoods and agreed we wanted something better <br/>
for<br/>
our kids. So, despite many comments from our parents and others we<br/>
co-slept, breastfed (well, I did anyway), wore our babies, had a home <br/>
water<br/>
birth, etc.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ben and I were L-A-T-E. I so wish we had done this from the get-go, but <br/>
we made huge strides as older parents.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so envious of those of you who figured/are figuring this out early.<br/>
<br/>
We hear a lot about just going with your heart/instincts/whatever. But, <br/>
basically, we were just doing what had been modeled for us---what our <br/>
parents had done. Ben and I had very similar childhoods---very <br/>
Southern, very traditional, very controlled. It wasn&#39;t second nature <br/>
*at all*  to us to think about the kids *now*---all our thoughts were <br/>
about our kids in 20 years to come. What kind of adults would they be, <br/>
not what kind of children they are *now*.<br/>
<br/>
That was a huge revelation for us.<br/>
<br/>
Reading these lists and the old message board gave us so much to think <br/>
about. Stopping and *thinking* before we said or did anything. Actually <br/>
TRYING to be a better parent.<br/>
<br/>
My dad is/was a pretty great dad, but I don&#39;t know that he actively <br/>
strived to be a better parent every day. I know my mother didn&#39;t. Ben&#39;s <br/>
either. They&#39;ve both said, &quot;I may have made a few mistakes, but *you* <br/>
turned out just fine.&quot; It was all about the finished product. Never <br/>
mind the pain and insecurity and anger and doubt. We turned out just <br/>
fine. No self-reflection, no self-examination. Just do what *your* <br/>
parents did, and the kids will turn out fine.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure it&#39;s seen as a slap in their faces for us to reject the way we <br/>
were reared, but frankly that&#39;s not *my* problem.<br/>
<br/>
I want my boys to have even fewer things to work through than I did. <br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s the case already. We talk a lot about parenting <br/>
WITH the boys! I doubt that&#39;s discussed---or even allowed to be <br/>
discussed---in many families. But they are appalled at some of the <br/>
parenting practices we see at Walmart. ANd BOTH have called me on <br/>
things when I wasn&#39;t doing the best I could. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wish there were some kind of &quot;Reflect on Your Own Childhood&quot; seminar <br/>
that new parents could take---to see whether that&#39;s the same kind of <br/>
parenting the want to engage in. How many teens say,&quot;I&#39;d *never* do/say <br/>
that to *my* children&quot;---yet grow up and do just that?<br/>
<br/>
It takes a lot of internal therapy to get over our feelings towards our <br/>
parents and how we were reared.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-796147450">Thanks for sharing this. What you said reminds me of my teens.  My<br/>
mother did and STILL DOES lay on the guilt for EVERYTHING.  As a teen<br/>
I could barely move a muscle without wondering if I had done something<br/>
wrong.  <br/>
<br/>
This sounds like a good conference seminar.  I think all parents could<br/>
 benefit from something like this.  Not just new ones.  Even though I<br/>
am fairly comfortable in our lives, things come up and need to be<br/>
dealt with.   <br/>
<br/>
Food for thought.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-839243029">Wow, I&#39;m envious of *that*.  We got together, got pregnant, had 2 babies, spent the first couple of years realizing we hadn&#39;t talked about *anything*, *then* we began the discussion.  Although we certainly know by now what we *don&#39;t* want, so that brings much clarity too, just more stress figuring it all out on the fly!  Now if we could only find the time to actually get married...&lt;g&gt;<br/>

I do a talk called &quot;The Zen of Unschooling&quot; that touches on this<br/>
aspect of the journey. I do think you should lead a discussion about<br/>
this. Very cool.<br/>

<br/>
Yeah---I&#39;m an early-prep/do a lot of research kind of gal. I do some <br/>
early conference planning too. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, even with the pre-marital counseling, Ben and I were in <br/>
agreement that we would pretty much parent the way our parents did. We <br/>
both agreed that the way we were reared had produced two pretty nice <br/>
people---we WERE marrying each other: how bad could we think we were? <br/>
&lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So there wasn&#39;t a lot---no, there was NO---thought given to that part. <br/>
We talked about it and agreed that it was good.<br/>
<br/>
Bummer.<br/>
