<div id="ygrps-yiv-1084405492">1. Many of you have met or know of my son Julian through my posts. He has  <br/>
unschooled for most of his life, and is beginning a career as a musician. He&#39;s a <br/>
 singer, songwriter, and guitar player. He wants to be a successful <br/>
professional  musician, and we&#39;re supporting him in making his dreams come true -- and <br/>
we&#39;d  love your help.<br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;ve made a new list to help Julian become famous. This is the  description: <br/>
 Julian Baptista is a young singer, songwriter, and guitarist  who has <br/>
unschooled for most of his life. He is beginning his career as a  musican, and would <br/>
like to do it the way he&#39;s lived his life -- free-range,  creatively, and <br/>
with joy, learning and living in the world.<br/>
<br/>
This group is  for people who would like to support Julian in his dream of <br/>
becoming a  well-known, respected, creative, and self-supporting musician. How <br/>
will you  help? You might provide ideas, reources, contacts, produce or attend <br/>
a house  concert, go to a gig, buy a cd, offer a place to crash, tell your <br/>
friends -- who  knows!<br/>

2. We want to help other unschoolers make their dreams come true,  too!  <br/>
After my Funshop on that topic at last year&#39;s Live and Learn  conference, I <br/>
promised to make a list to do that, and finally, it&#39;s  here!!!  This group is for <br/>
brainstorming, resources, and support as all  ages of unschoolers work to reach <br/>
their dreams.  To subscribe, send  e-mail to:  <br/>
