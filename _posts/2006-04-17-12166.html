<div id="ygrps-yiv-1638690136">As for the coffee and food let me elaborate.  Yes I do put some limitations<br/>
on my daughter.  She&#39;s 2.5 and I feel at this age she needs guidance as to<br/>
what is good for her to learn to make good decisions.  I also feel that<br/>
realistically in life the majority of people have limitations, things they<br/>
can and can&#39;t do on the job, in public, etc.  I am an unschooler not a<br/>
radical unschooler.  When it comes to food she has been making decisions<br/>
about what she wants since she was 14 months old.  She knows that some foods<br/>
help you grow and some don&#39;t.  She also knows which of these are acceptable<br/>
for her to eat and which aren&#39;t.  I never lie to her about food.  Carob<br/>
chips are candy to her b/c that&#39;s what she compares it to.  When she asks to<br/>
taste something generally we let her.  For example last Halloween we took<br/>
her trick or treating.  She didn&#39;t know what candy was, all she understood<br/>
was that it was something the older kids (trick or treaters that came to our<br/>
door) coveted.  She played with the few pieces of candy she got and when she<br/>
finally got one open she took a few licks and that was that.  She&#39;s never<br/>
asked for candy again, but she knows it&#39;s something you shouldn&#39;t eat often<br/>
because it doesn&#39;t help you grow.  BTW we handed out pretzels not candy.  I<br/>
am aware that the forbidden fruit is always the most tempting so when she<br/>
asks I generally allow a small taste.  But there are things we consume that<br/>
I don&#39;t feel are appropriate for 2.5 you may disagree and that is your<br/>
choice.  My daughter didn&#39;t start drinking juice until she was close to 2.<br/>
We never offered and she never asked.  When she did decide she wanted to<br/>
taster ours we let her.  Coffee and soda I just don&#39;t feel are appropriate.<br/>
That&#39;s my opinion others can do as they see fit for their kids.  Those of<br/>
you who responded that I&#39;m limiting her freedom by not letting her taste it<br/>
would you also let your child have a sip of your margarita (at 2.5) and if<br/>
your child decided they liked it what then.  Maybe you feel it&#39;s okay for a<br/>
child of that age to have a taste of coffee, alcohol, soda, whatever if it&#39;s<br/>
only a taste and not very often I don&#39;t, and I don&#39;t feel I&#39;m limiting her<br/>
freedom by not allowing her to taste it, nor do I feel I&#39;m doing any harm by<br/>
explaining to her the reason why it&#39;s ok for me to have it not her.  Maybe<br/>
it&#39;s not a good example of me, but it also shows that there are times it&#39;s<br/>
okay to have things you want even when they&#39;re not the best for you.  <br/>

Joyce wrote: <br/>
What you&#39;re doing is creating a mystique about coffee (as people  <br/>
often do about alcohol). It becomes not just a drink made with coffee  <br/>
beans but a rite of passage to adulthood, <br/>
<br/>
I appreciated this comment.  It has some truth, but I don&#39;t think, speaking<br/>
specifically about coffee, that she&#39;ll be limited long enough for it to have<br/>
any grave mystique to her.<br/>

Joyce wrote:<br/>
But that comforting bubble bursts when they get older and realize  <br/>
there are foods that sound interesting that they&#39;d like to try. Or <br/>
things they try other places that they&#39;d like you to buy.<br/>
<br/>
I know this is true which is why I&#39;m hoping to help shape her tastes now so<br/>
that the foods that she&#39;d like to try are in general foods that would be<br/>
good for her.<br/>

How would it sound if you heard a parent say &quot;we go up to a week at a  <br/>
time with her not even asking to read a book&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
How many people zone out reading a book?<br/>

Joyce wrote:<br/>
TV is not a demon. 2.5  yos often don&#39;t watch much if it isn&#39;t on.  <br/>
(At 3 though, it seems not uncommon to want to watch the same video  <br/>
or movie or set of shows over and over and over. It&#39;s a stage of  <br/>
development that does pass.)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t consider it to be a demon, my husband and I enjoy watching and so<br/>
does she.  When she asks to watch something she is allowed.</div>

  Well, coffee isn&#39;t a margarita (and I don&#39;t drink either one) so your example isn&#39;t valid.  I have let my boys have a taste of wine when I&#39;m having a glass (maybe 3 times a week) if they&#39;d like.  My oldest and youngest have liked it on occasion.  Andy won&#39;t touch the stuff -- can&#39;t get past the smell of it.  <br/>
   <br/>
  If the only reason it&#39;s okay for you to have it and not her is your advanced age, you&#39;ve already made it forbidden fruit, something to covet for when she&#39;s able to get away with it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1809803573">In Europe children are introduced to alcohol at an early age as a matter of<br/>
course.  Often children are served beer or wine with dinner.  Of course, I<br/>
don&#39;t say that it&#39;s okay just because Europeans do it.  I&#39;m just saying that<br/>
the &quot;would you let your child drink alcohol&quot; argument may not be as strong<br/>

believe everything your parents told you when you were growing up &quot;because<br/>
they said so?&quot;  And the foods that are &quot;acceptable&quot; are acceptable only to<br/>
you.  Have you read some of the articles on food limitations at Sandra<br/>
Dodd&#39;s website.  I never believed them when we first started unschooling<br/>

such as &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad.&quot;  Chocoate isn&#39;t bad (in fact in my world chocolate<br/>
is very very good :)  )  Chocolate is just chocolate.  It is how much we eat<br/>
and how often we eat it and how much we eat it that effects our body and<br/>
what we do with the energy it gives us.  If we eat a &quot;totally chocolate<br/>
dinner&quot; we may not feel so good and crave something different to eat.  When<br/>
children don&#39;t have &quot;bad foods&quot; limited to them they choose foods that their<br/>
bodies ask for rather than what their brain tells them they should have.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up with major food issues.  Foods were categorized for me into &quot;good&quot;<br/>
and &quot;bad&quot; (can someone tell me how okra made it on the good list?)  Now that<br/>
I am in my 40&#39;s I STILL have labels for food.  Good foods and bad foods.  I<br/>
STILL sneak cookies and eat them in hiding so that no one will see me eating<br/>
&quot;bad food.&quot;  I&#39;m forty years old.  I&#39;m an adult.  And I still sneak food.<br/>

have.  And they generally go, &quot;Oh, OK.  Kind of sweet, but buzzy.&quot;  We&#39;ve<br/>

parents but my aunts and uncles) so my kids know from experiencing my drunk<br/>
relatives what alcohol can do to a person.  Will that stop them from getting<br/>
drunk when they are older?  No. Probably not.  That is something they may<br/>
want to experience.  However, I would hazard to guess that they will<br/>
probably get really drunk once (or maybe twice) and think, &quot;Man, I hate the<br/>
way I feel the night after and am not so sure that the pleasure the night<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-943608511">okay im curious than.  if there are no limits whatsoever, how do you keep your children from running out into the street?  from jumping off a high building or a bridge?  im thinking there has to be some limits?  i mean eventually they have to live in a society full of rules as an adult and not everyone will be able to own their own business and will probably have to work for someone else.  how will they learn they have to follow the rules to keep a job?  or even to follow the law?  what if when they are teenagers they want to experiment with illegal drugs?  and what if they do and get busted and end up in jail, the ultimate limiting experience?  i am not trying to challenge anyone, im just really curious?  i wrote a couple of weeks ago about the unschooling thing and since then i found that my son went crazy with boredom.  he just isnt the type of child to self motivate!  we are still trying to find our way.  <br/>

&quot;common sense&quot; things like stove burners are hot and sticking your tongue to<br/>
a metal pole during winter is not.  And yes; we do teach our children not to<br/>
run out in the street, but we tell them WHY they shouldn&#39;t run out into the<br/>
street and then teach them how to safely cross the street or go out into<br/>
the street to retrieve something.  I&#39;ve witnessed countless mothers yelling<br/>
at their children, &quot;You don&#39;t run out into the street.  Ever!&quot;  No<br/>
explaination.  My oldest child taught me early on that I could not have<br/>
&quot;because I said so&quot; rules.  She would have deliberately run out into the<br/>
street just to test a &quot;because I said so rule.&quot;  When she was less than 2<br/>
years old I learned that she needed explainations as to why things are so.<br/>
When our children are near a street or in a parking lot we never say, &quot;don&#39;t<br/>
run out in the street&quot; we say, &quot;Look for cars.&quot;  And as parents it is our<br/>
responsibility to protect our children from the dangers of cars and<br/>
strangers and stampeding wildebeasts and to help them learn to protect<br/>
themselves from the dangers of cars strangers and stampeding wildebeasts.<br/>
<br/>
My brother would be a great unschooler if he would trust himself.  He rarely<br/>
tells his daughter that there is something she can&#39;t do.  She wanted to help<br/>
fix the roof of the church they attend after Hurricane Ivan, so my brother<br/>
taught her how to safely walk on the roof and what to do if she thought she<br/>
was losing her balance.  I think she was around 9 years old at the time.  So<br/>
there she was on top of the roof scampering around and pulling up old<br/>
shingles.  Another time she wanted to swim out to a sand bar at the beach.<br/>
Rather than telling her that it was too far or too dangerous, he suggested<br/>
that they swim out there together.  Both of them are very good swimmers.<br/>
Later my son wanted to go out to the sand bar.  He is not a very good<br/>
swimmer (he&#39;s a great flailer though).  So rather than telling him no, my<br/>
brother got one of the small float boats we had been using, loaded my son up<br/>
on it and towed him to the sand bar which was just teeming with all kinds of<br/>
little creatures.  What a great day that was for him.  He was not limited in<br/>
what he wanted to do. He was provided with a safe means to do so.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1372554563">Hello Sher...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not going to reply to the first part of your post (about limits) <br/>
because we&#39;re still on that path and besides, Ren&#39;s reply was excellent <br/>
(I saved it), but I&#39;d like to offer some advice for this part:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;i wrote a couple of weeks ago about the unschooling thing and <br/>
 </span></blockquote>since then i found that my son went crazy with boredom.  he just isnt <br/>
the type of child to self motivate! we are still trying to find our <br/>
way.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Have you read much about deschooling? There&#39;s a period of time (after <br/>
leaving school or structured school-at-home) where a child needs time <br/>
to...chill out, deprogram, unwind, get in touch with themselves, etc. <br/>
This may look like restlessness, boredom, etc. <br/>
What type of things does he enjoy AND what type of things have you been <br/>
suggesting and offering to him? <br/>
As far as self-motivation....how long was your son in school? I believe <br/>
that school can squash any motivation a child has and it may take some <br/>
time to gain that back. My kids went through that also...school showed <br/>
them that learning has to be spoon fed and handed to them so when I <br/>
took them out of school, they sat back and waited for me to feed <br/>
them/teach them. Instead, I bought some cool new games and craft kits, <br/>
bought season passes to a nature park and also to a water park right <br/>
near us, read with them and to them just about every day, took us all <br/>
to get library cards and joined blockbuster online. <br/>
Now, a year later, my girls are motivated because it&#39;s *their* life, <br/>
and *their* thoughts and they feel free (probably for the first time in <br/>
their lives-we adopted them after they had grown up in the foster care <br/>
system). They want to learn because it makes their life interesting.<br/>
Like you, we&#39;re still trying to find our way but we&#39;re really, really <br/>
enjoying the journey. I hope it never ends. :-)<br/>

No one said that. What we suggest is no ARBITRARY limits.<br/>

<br/>
If a child is so small that streets are a issue, mom should carry the <br/>
child or hold his hand.<br/>
<br/>
How often do you leave a small child at the top of a high building or <br/>
bridge alone and unsupervised???<br/>
<br/>
If streets, high buildings, and bridges are your concerns, maybe you <br/>
have bigger problems!<br/>

I&#39;m glad you&#39;re thinking! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are natural limits. There are self-imposed limits. There are <br/>
societal limits.<br/>
<br/>
There are arbitrary, parent-imposed limits.<br/>
<br/>
Which limits do you suppose we suggest? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>

an adult ****<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
*I* have lived in a world full of limits since I was a very small <br/>
child. I get to choose which ones I will live with, follow, bend, <br/>
ignore. So do my children.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
***and not everyone will be able to own their own business and will <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;d venture to guess that *most* unschoolers will eventually BOTH work <br/>
for someone else AND own their own business(es). But they don&#39;t HAVE to <br/>
do either. They get to choose.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
But I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve asked *yourself* any of these questions. Have <br/>
you asked yourself? Have you come up with an answer or two? What do <br/>
*YOU* think would happen?<br/>

-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
What do you mean &quot;went crazy with boredom&quot;? Did you just quit giving <br/>
him assignments? Did you say, &quot;Just do whatever&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Did you take him out to an ethnic restaurant? Watch movies together? Go <br/>
to the beach? Look for fossils? Plant a butterfly garden? Make candles? <br/>
Play with puppies at the animal shelter? Play video games with him? <br/>
Make sushi? Look at the stars? Paint/decorate his bedroom? Play rummy? <br/>
Go to the zoo? Fly a kite? Look at maps? Make spaghetti? Roll coins? <br/>
Pressure-wash the house? Buy a second-hand guitar? Swim at the Y? Make <br/>
Artist Trading Cards? Plant zucchini? ...or OKRA(!) &lt;g&gt;?<br/>
<br/>
What didn&#39;t *you* do with him that made him so bored?<br/>
<br/>
Everyone (who is healthy) is self-motivated to do something. It <br/>
probably WON&#39;T look like schoolwork, but generally unschooling does NOT <br/>
look like schoolwork (and you will just have to get over that). Real <br/>
learning happens as a part of living. Were you making his world small? <br/>
Or opening it up and making it bigger?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
*** he just isnt the type of child to self motivate!***<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I hope you think better of him than that. And I *really* hope you&#39;ve <br/>
never said that to him!<br/>
<br/>
How old is he? Have you always homeschooled? Did you just pull him out <br/>
of school? Have you given him time to deschool? What are his passions? <br/>
What &quot;will he do all day if you let him&quot;?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1154092109">Okay, I&#39;m still a newbie and maybe not one who should be giving advice<br/>
but in this case, I can&#39;t help it.  You ask these things as if our<br/>
established school systems and society are pumping out non-criminals<br/>
and those who are totally obedient.  People break laws and go to jail,<br/>
people do drugs, people buck the system, people don&#39;t listen to their<br/>
employees and usually they&#39;ll get fired when they do, many children<br/>
argue and disagree with their parents...have been since FOREVER and<br/>
probably will continue to do so. <br/>
<br/>
A parent modeling respect towards their spouse, a parent modeling<br/>
respect towards their children, a parent modeling respect to those<br/>
adults who are WORTHY of respect.  A parent who puts on their<br/>
seatbelt, a parent who doesn&#39;t drive drunk, a parent who stays within<br/>
the speed limit (well, maybe a &quot;few&quot; miles over) a parent who doesn&#39;t<br/>
steal, etc....is absolutely the BEST ROLE MODEL in the world for a<br/>
child to be around and that betters their chances in this world and<br/>
society that they will live in as both children and adults.  When<br/>
children are with their parents and other adults who model respect, it<br/>
has an OUTSTANDING chance of rubbing off on one&#39;s children without a<br/>
big effort.  Also, what better example can a child fine of owning up<br/>
to one&#39;s mistakes?  My children see my vulnerabilities, they see me<br/>
fail and they see me make corrections and apologize...they understand<br/>
that and I can see it in them (they&#39;re still working on it as am I)<br/>
too when they sincerely apologize to one another, when they say &#39;sorry<br/>
&#39; and mean it, etc.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-404123153">I&#39;m sorry, I know I&#39;m supposed to trim posts and all, but EVERYTHING Kelly said here resonated in me.  It really made me think.  I know I&#39;ve VERY guilty of spending far too much time on the computer, or cleaning, and leaving my kids to play together, figuring that since they are siblings they can entertain each other.  And then when it all erupts into bickering, I get annoyed because MY LIFE has been interrupted.  How very sad of me - I&#39;m just being honest.<br/>
<br/>
What Kelly wrote has helped me to see what it means to unschool.  It&#39;s not about letting my children run wild and do what they want.  It&#39;s not about shirking my responsibility, but it&#39;s about embracing it.  It&#39;s about spending actual time with my children, about getting to know them like I would a friend or someone I was dating.  Unschooling is about being present with my children, and seeing them for who they are.  Not who I wish they would be, or who I want them to be.<br/>
<br/>
All of this is MUCH MORE DIFFICULT than people realize.  They think unschooling is easy.  They think it&#39;s about letting your kids just &quot;go&quot;.  NO, unschooling is about being the most active parent you can possibly be.  It&#39;s about putting away the workbook that you would have your child do, and spending that time with them doing and being.  It&#39;s about playing a game and just laughing with your child - not playing a game &quot;to learn something&quot;.  It&#39;s about spending time with your child like you would spend with your best friend, or your partner - just enjoying their company.  And that&#39;s far harder to do than sending them to public school, private school, or even buying a complete curriculum.  But it&#39;s far more rewarding.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so grateful for this group and the wisdom in it.<br/>
