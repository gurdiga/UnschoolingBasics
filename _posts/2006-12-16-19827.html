<div id="ygrps-yiv-2139930218">I love the idea of an unassisted! I had baby #1 no drugs  in the hospital, <br/>
baby #2 at home with midwife and baby #3 almost  unassisted by accident because <br/>
the midwife pulled into the driveway  while the head was coming out, LOL. If I <br/>
ever do it again I would  have a midwife in the other room but not with me <br/>
unless I had  trouble. After having been to over 200 births and seeing what can <br/>
go  wrong, I would advise to please learn the gaskin maneuver for  shoulder <br/>
dystocia, also neonatal resuscitation and how to stop a  hemorrhage if there are <br/>
placenta problems at the end. Those three things  are ULTRA important, once <br/>
you know them you will be so much better  off! Please read everything that <br/>
Rahima Baldwin, Elizabeth Davis and  Ina May Gaskin have written and you will do <br/>
great!<br/>
Best of luck to you and God Bless. How  exciting!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-733488602">Thanks for the tips, Adriana.  I just finished reading &quot;Emergency<br/>
Child Birth&quot; and it was very informative and reassuring.  It covers<br/>
some of the things you mentioned, and I will look up the rest,<br/>
especially the Gaskin Maneuver (in case it is different than what is<br/>
described in the book - for me, more options is better).<br/>
