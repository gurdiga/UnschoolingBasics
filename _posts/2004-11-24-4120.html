<div id="ygrps-yiv-1924153752">&quot;How would John Holt hepl a child to learn an<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; instrument?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can only guess, since we can&#39;t get it straight from Holt <br/>
himself....<br/>
<br/>
Bring in a variety of instruments for joyful exploration, play music <br/>
yourself, answer your child&#39;s questions, play a variety of CD&#39;S and <br/>
music styles, play music videos, in other words, fill your home with <br/>
music and instruments and enjoy them yourself.<br/>
If a child wants something more formal, it will usually come in <br/>
later years and you can assist them the way you have their entire <br/>
lives, by helping them find the resources they need.<br/>
Easy, fun.....and so unschoolish.<br/>
