The choices were not the same in the 70s and 80s and many parents still don&#39;t know what their options are and can&#39;t act on them even if they do know.<br/>
<br/>
Drug problems and other life problems happen to all sorts of people and I hope your Mom is getting the counseling she needs to let go of some of the guilt she is piling on herself. Along with hugs! :)<br/>

It was meant to applaud her for being open enough to <br/>
see things differently than she had before.<br/>

  Don&#39;t apologize for how I felt. That&#39;s my thing and it&#39;s ok. I&#39;ve read a few posts like yours on a couple different lists lately and I&#39;m grateful for them. They help me to solidify my commitment to unschooling. I didn&#39;t think you presented your mother in a bad light. I got what you meant. I wish my husband would get that. He supports me in homeschooling and unschooling but, if asked, he still says he doesn&#39;t see anything wrong with sending kids to school. It frustrates me to no end. He didn&#39;t have any problems or struggles in school and he just can&#39;t see others.<br/>
