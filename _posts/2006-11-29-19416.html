<div id="ygrps-yiv-1339797348">I have really been enjoying all the awesome advice and views posted in <br/>
this group.  So I want to ask your advice on unschooling a reluctate<br/>
teenager.  I think I posted something about this in the past but as <br/>
the time draws near, figure I better prepare.<br/>
<br/>
My step-daughter has no desire beyond flirting with boys.  She&#39;s <br/>
14.8yo and currently in ps 9th grade.  Her mom has &quot;thrown in the <br/>
towel&quot; about her passing.  My spouse wants to &quot;homeschool&quot; her and <br/>
remove her from the only thing she cares about.  Her social life.<br/>
<br/>
I warned him, that she has never had a desire to do school work, and <br/>
by pulling her away from her friends, is going to create a living hell <br/>
at home.  We live in the middle of nowhere, really, so there&#39;s no kids <br/>
in the neighborhood, no stores to walk to, no one to hitch a ride from <br/>
except me, dad or her older step-sister.  <br/>
<br/>
She showed a musical interest so I got her a piano, and a harp she <br/>
wanted, but her mother refused to let her go to lessons even if I or <br/>
grandma paid.  (I feel so bad for this child)  With her homeschooling, <br/>
I can get her to music lessons without involving her mom or dad, but I <br/>
see a very bad situation for my son and I, who have been enjoying <br/>
unschooling.  He&#39;s nine and is really enjoying life.  He would love <br/>
for his half-sister to be home with him, but I am worried that she&#39;ll <br/>
take out her anger on him.<br/>
<br/>
I, personally, have had issues coming to grip with all that has <br/>
happened this past year.  I work full-time 4-12pm Sun-Thurs. A must to <br/>
help pay the bills.  My daughter, 16 yo, watches grandma and the nine <br/>
yo when dad&#39;s and my schedules cross.  He&#39;s a firefighter, so on shift <br/>
every third day.  This breaks down to her heating dinner around 6-7 <br/>
days a month.  Grandma had a stroke last winter, so she is learning to <br/>
get around, but her mind is slipping a little.  It&#39;s sort of like <br/>
having an eight year old added to the mix.<br/>
<br/>
Please excuse the half, step, etc...I just put them in to give a truer <br/>
picture of the relationships of the parties involved.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m worried that if my spouse pulls her from her friends, he risks <br/>
losing his daughter in the long run and he&#39;ll create a very bad home <br/>
envirnoment for everyone else.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts and insights would be appreciated.  My spouse does listen <br/>
to the views I present him.</div>

My stepson hates school and we are (still) trying to convince his <br/>
mom to let us homeschool him. He is also very social and really <br/>
values seeing his friends, but he acknowledged, when asked, that he <br/>
doesn&#39;t actually get to spend much time with them, really, at <br/>
school. Its just that they are what make it bearable At All. If he <br/>
can see friends on weekends, he would actually get to see them <br/>
*more* than he does at school. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-877088116">Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve gotten from her and her teachers so far:<br/>
<br/>
She socializes in class during class.<br/>
She&#39;s very bright, but won&#39;t do any work.<br/>
Likes her Drama class, but refuses to take tests.<br/>
Not that she can&#39;t, just doesn&#39;t.<br/>
When she does do the work, it&#39;s brillant. <br/>
She just stares at you when you ask her what&#39;s going on.<br/>
She would just like to stay in ps and be left alone<br/>
Failing has never bothered her. (Been doing it for years)<br/>
She gets more stressed over being graded.<br/>
<br/>
She has some desire to DDR, likes myspace, likes to make music<br/>
(which I have been trying to encourage), likes acting as long as <br/>
it&#39;s on her terms, <br/>
<br/>
There is no public transportation, only 100,000 acres of woods.<br/>
They pay me to drive my kids to the nearest bus stop as even <br/>
the public school won&#39;t come out here. (not kidding.  I lose $200.<br/>
a month by not sending my son to ps. Weird, huh)<br/>
<br/>
I would gladly take her to extra cirriculars but my spouse says<br/>
if she gets pulled, he won&#39;t allow it.  I put her in dance with my daughter<br/>
when they were little and they both really enjoyed it.  My step-daughter&#39;s<br/>
mom stopped that!  Even if I pay and drive, she refused her daughter<br/>
everything she has wanted to try.  When it was our part of the summer,<br/>
I let her try as much as I could.<br/>
<br/>
If he pulls her, I plan on taking her for music lessons I know she wants.<br/>
I figure I&#39;ll schedule them during the day when her mom&#39;s working, on<br/>
a variable schedule, so I can take her when Dad&#39;s working, too.<br/>
(loop holes?  Worth the fight.)<br/>
<br/>
They pulled her computer time, cell phone, and completely grounded her<br/>
this semester, until she pulled her grades up to a 2.0, but she didn&#39;t care<br/>
and continues to fail.   She knows her father plans to remove her if she doesn&#39;t <br/>
start doing her school work but even that seems to mean nothing.<br/>
I told my spouse not to worry so much about the <br/>
grades as she is far more educated at 14 then many out there.<br/>
If and when she wants to learn, she will.<br/>
<br/>
I would never have raised her as these two do.<br/>
She has tended to  be a chunky child, but this year she has been slimming up.<br/>
She wants to look good.  That pretty much sums it up.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the ideas of things to ask.  <br/>
