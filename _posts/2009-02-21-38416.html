<div id="ygrps-yiv-872073021">I am in the process of reading Naomi Aldort&#39;s &quot;Raising Our Children, <br/>
Raising Ourselves&quot;, which I never would have read if I hadn&#39;t been <br/>
part of this group.  She says to Separate yourself from the behavior <br/>
and visualize if what you are going to say is true about your child <br/>
and their behavior.<br/>
<br/>
Well, today, my 3yo made a decent sized mess with A&D ointment (not <br/>
easy to clean up!!!) and right before I got angry with him I followed <br/>
her advice.  I waited a minute and leaned down to him and said, &quot;I <br/>
know you enjoy making a mess with this, but mommy is the one that has <br/>
to clean it up.  What are you trying to do with it?&quot;  Then he <br/>
proceeded to tell me that he was trying to make sure his Webkin <br/>
didn&#39;t get a diaper rash.  I listened and offered a solution to clean <br/>
up the ointment and help put a diaper on his stuffed animals.  He was <br/>
happy, excited and we bonded instead of me yelling at him for making <br/>
a mess.<br/>
<br/>
See - he wasn&#39;t intending on making a mess.  He wanted to be helpful <br/>
and had I not just read that book I would have handled things the <br/>
same old way - treating him as if he was just trying to make a mess <br/>
that I had to clean up.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know who recommended the book and I&#39;m not finished yet, but <br/>
THANK YOU!!!  I am really trying to be a different parent and I like <br/>
my kids and self much better!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1175134003">Hi,<br/>
What has helped me over the years, is not to see it as a mess, I look at it  <br/>
as their play, their play maybe messy, but they usually are not making an  <br/>
intentional mess,and as my kids have gotten over, they offense when someone  <br/>
calls their play a mess.  I also see it as a way to express their  creativity, and <br/>
I now really appreciate the creative individuals they have  become, which I <br/>
attribute  a lot of that to their messy play, that I didn&#39;t  mind cleaning up.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1862270131">Heather.  I am so happy for you.  I am also reading the book and <br/>
trying so hard to put her methods in to practice.  It is taking time, <br/>
but whenever I am able to stop myself from the old ways, I am able to <br/>
see the truth in my children&#39;s actions and we ALL come out of the <br/>
situation with understanding and resolve.  I am glad to see others <br/>
are enjoying the book too. I am not sure who suggested it, but I am <br/>
raising my hand in agreement!!!!!!<br/>
