<div id="ygrps-yiv-2082935858">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I am in UK, and have been broadly following the unschooling <br/>
principle for 4 years with my 12 yo ds.  I have a 22 yo son who was <br/>
not homeschooled.  My husband sort of gets it, my eldest son is <br/>
oblivious which is to be expected.... but my husband&#39;s eyes glaze <br/>
over when I have tried to explain some of the reasons behind the <br/>
unschooling way, including chores.  DH is fairly laid back anyway, <br/>
so his attitude is fine, and lets me &#39;get on with it my way&#39;.  <br/>
<br/>
He has a business which keeps him occupied, and he sees the results <br/>
of my not following a rigid plan, and allowing ds to join in chores <br/>
as and when they affect him.  It isnt easy for men to manage the <br/>
everyday chores, even my eldest son admits to being able to cook, <br/>
but not get all the food out piping hot on a plate.... I do believe <br/>
they come from another planet you know (LOL)!!! <br/>
<br/>
I do feel for you at this time, with a new babe, and feeling rotten <br/>
with a cold.  It isnt easy to get your husband on board with your <br/>
plans in your vulnerable state at present...you need to muster your <br/>
energy to be patient with your man, but most of all be patient with <br/>
yourself.<br/>
<br/>
It isnt the best of ways, but it has worked for me....sometimes at <br/>
home we &#39;do what is expected from dh when he is around&#39; and &#39;carry <br/>
on with what we normally do when dh is at work&#39; the rest of the <br/>
time.  My son realises that tension can evaporate if we all muddle <br/>
and muck in together to help with the chores so that we  can <br/>
all &#39;have a sit down or space to follow our particular hobbies&#39;. <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps with all the extra things your husband has taken on board, <br/>
he feels a bit cornered into trying to understand the unschooling <br/>
way of doing things.  <br/>
<br/>
One of my main concerns over the past few years has been to explain <br/>
to my eldest son things that happened when he was young, that <br/>
thankfully, since seeing the light, I dont do with my young son.<br/>
<br/>
He went to school, was made to do homework, made to go to bed at a <br/>
regular time, made to take up some form of interest or hobby or <br/>
music, etc. (head hung in shame here....and I have smacked him and <br/>
punished him) made him eat meals he didnt like &#39;for his own good&#39;, <br/>
etc. etc.  I cant believe how far I have come, since my son was <br/>
bullied at school, and I extracted him from the state system.....and <br/>
thankfully found the Unschooling.com site.<br/>
<br/>
Things will change, gradually at first....there is a book especially <br/>
for us wives/partners to read about husbands taking a greater role <br/>
in child rearing and housework.  I will have to go look it up, and <br/>
will post here it soon.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, someone more experienced on this site will be able to <br/>
offer some tips for you.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes...Sonia in England    <br/>

Subject: Can I vent here? (long post w/ ?)<br/>
 <br/>
I know I&#39;m new to all this, but I&#39;m trying hard. My hubby, however, <br/>
is not. He is (sorta) okay<br/>
with the not schooling on purpose (he probably thinks it&#39;s a phase), <br/>
but everything else.<br/>
Ugh, I can&#39;t even begin to describe it, and maybe it&#39;s just newbaby <br/>
hormones, but it<br/>
honestly seems like he&#39;s trying to make things *harder* for me! When <br/>
I talked to him about<br/>
not forcing the kids to do chores, etc, he kind of laughed it off <br/>
and said that he&#39;ll see how<br/>
long I last. I mean, I thought he understood all the lead up, agreed <br/>
when we talked about<br/>
how when WE do chores we don&#39;t think twice about sitting down to <br/>
rest or grabbing a soda<br/>
or whatever. Every time I turned around today, he did something that <br/>
he totally would not<br/>
have done before though. Including hiding all the game pieces that <br/>
were accidentally left<br/>
out when the kids (voluntarily!) cleaned up their games. His pet <br/>
peeve is that he&#39;s a<br/>
workaholic (Iike me) but wants everyone else to bust their butts <br/>
working all the time<br/>
(unlike me).<br/>
 <br/>
I can deal with the kids, but I&#39;m about to kill my husband. I was <br/>
going to talk to him<br/>
tonight, but I think I need to rationally think for a day or two, <br/>
and get advice from other<br/>
parents who had to deal with partners who didn&#39;t back them up. (or <br/>
maybe purposefully<br/>
sabotaged!) I&#39;m so tired anyway, I don&#39;t need this kind of crap. I <br/>
don&#39;t understand why he<br/>
was willing to split housework 50/50 before the kids were able to <br/>
help, but isn&#39;t willing to<br/>
do it now. It&#39;s like his job is to make sure the kids do all the <br/>
work. grrr! Considering how<br/>
much work they did when I was on bedrest, and they&#39;re still so young.<br/>
 <br/>
Does this make sense? I know it&#39;s late and I&#39;m still not asleep, AND <br/>
I have a cold, so maybe<br/>
I&#39;m not making sense. I just know that I&#39;m mad enough to lay in bed <br/>
and stew, so I wanted<br/>
to come and post here just to get it off my chest and see if someone <br/>
has some advice for<br/>
me. I know it&#39;s hard on dh, I get frustrated too. Throughout this <br/>
pregnancy things have<br/>
changed significantly in our lives, our relationship with each <br/>
other, with the kids, etc. He&#39;s<br/>
had to take on a lot of roles that I&#39;ve covered since marriage (Ha! <br/>
I did everything until the<br/>
bedrest, housework, yard work, car maintainance, bills, therapy, <br/>
schoolwork) In less than<br/>
nine months, he&#39;s doing much of this, we started homeschooling, I&#39;ve <br/>
changed my<br/>
parenting, but doesn&#39;t it seem that he should be able to roll with <br/>
the punches? I&#39;m not<br/>
asking him to do more work, just support me as I take on more. Or at <br/>
least be respectful<br/>
of the what the kids do, and when they do it.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for listening, I hope this was ok to post such a long vent, I <br/>
think I&#39;ll go back and<br/>
put that in my subject line as a warning!!!<br/>
