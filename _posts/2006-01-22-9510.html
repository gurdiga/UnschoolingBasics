<div id="ygrps-yiv-1666772264">Hi, group!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve posted here a handful of times, but I&#39;ve yet to offer <br/>
a &quot;formal&quot; intro (my bad!), so here we go!<br/>
<br/>
My name is Paige Parr, and my family and I live and learn and laugh <br/>
and love in the beautiful Shenandoah Valley of Virginia <br/>
(specifically, Waynesboro VA...about 30 min. from Charlottesville).  <br/>
I&#39;m mom to four amazing girls:  Shelby (12), Tori (7), Ashlyn (6), <br/>
and Loryn (aka Lolo, 3).  My two younger girls have been diagnosed <br/>
with autism.  Ashlyn&#39;s diagnosis was the main reason I held off on <br/>
unschooling...I just thought it wasn&#39;t possible to unschool with <br/>
kids on the spectrum...everyone I spoke with about autism, every <br/>
book I read on the subject, stressed the need for structure:  <br/>
structured school time, structured &quot;playtime&quot; (WHAT?), meals, <br/>
bedtimes, etc.  To me, unschooling equaled FREEDOM, and every <br/>
resource I stumbled across stressed that &quot;these children&quot; couldn&#39;t <br/>
handle that (glorious!) freedom.  It wasn&#39;t until I had dug deeper <br/>
that I found (through Sandra Dodd&#39;s site, and unschooling.info, and <br/>
the shine group) that MANY families with special needs kids were <br/>
unschooling, and their children were living beautiful FULL lives.  <br/>
So we jumped in with both feet and haven&#39;t looked back since.  And, <br/>
surprise, surprise...autism has barely entered my vocabulary since <br/>
we began our journey.  It just hasn&#39;t been an issue...the girls are <br/>
just their own amazing selves and we no longer focus on how <br/>
to &quot;help&quot; them be more &quot;normal&quot; (whatever THAT is)!  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the recent TV thread has been interesting to read.  Since we <br/>
began deschooling (almost a year ago), we&#39;ve let go of tv controls.  <br/>
We have three TVs now, big plasma screen with DVR in living room, <br/>
smaller TV with Gamecube in Tori&#39;s and Ash&#39;s room, and another big <br/>
TV in our bedroom (with PS2 and DVR).  My husband and I enjoy LOTS <br/>
of TV, movies, and music that mainstream parents might try to <br/>
shelter their kids from...and to be honest, I sometimes wonder if <br/>
we&#39;re a little *too* open with regards to what the kids listen to or <br/>
watch.  <br/>
<br/>
One recent example:  Shelby and Tori caught the tail end of the <br/>
movie &quot;Love Actually&quot; the other night on Showtime or HBO (not sure <br/>
which).  Well, it just so happens that it&#39;s one of my most favorite <br/>
films ever, and it *was* at the end of the film, where all the <br/>
little stories are being tied up, happy endings and all that.  *I* <br/>
had fun pointing out Alan Rickman, and telling the girls that he <br/>
played Snape in the Harry Potter films (to which they replied, &quot;No <br/>
he DOESN&#39;T...that guy is too OLD!&quot;) and also Emma Thompson, who <br/>
played Prof. Trelawney in the HP films, and that Liam Neeson had <br/>
played Ra&#39;s al Ghul in the latest Batman flick, so on and so on.  <br/>
Shelby commented that Colin Firth was CUTE, then it was off and we <br/>
were getting changed for bed.  Shelby asked me to see if it came on <br/>
again, and if I could record it on the DVR.  She was pleased when I <br/>
told her that I owned the movie on DVD, and that she could watch it <br/>
anytime she wanted.  <br/>
<br/>
So then, next day I&#39;m putting laundry away and I see Shelby in the <br/>
girls room watching &quot;Love Actually&quot; on the DVD player.  I watched a <br/>
bit with her, then went on with the laundry.  Fast forward an hour <br/>
or so, and Shelby comes up to me and says, &quot;Hey Mom...what was the <br/>
deal with the actors who fell in love during the porn film?&quot;. (Side <br/>
note:  in the movie there is a sub-plot or side-story about a man <br/>
and woman who *simulate* sexual positions on adult movies...they are <br/>
not the actual actors, but they &quot;act out&quot; the bits so that camera <br/>
positions and lighting can be set up.  Anyway, the couple is very <br/>
sweet and innocent, this is just a job to them, and they end up <br/>
getting to know each other and falling in love).  Well, you can <br/>
imagine that for a split second I was completely flustered and <br/>
kicking myself over NOT remembering that part of the movie.  I just <br/>
had to quickly remind myself to be honest with her.  I explained <br/>
that to me, it was funny...maybe ironic...that these two people <br/>
would fall in love on the set of an adult movie, and that sex had <br/>
NOTHING to do with their relationship...they were just very <br/>
innocently falling in love.  She was just like, &quot;OK&quot;, and that was <br/>
it...she just wanted to know more about that particular part of the <br/>
flick.  No harm meant, and she trusted me enough to ask, and I <br/>
trusted her enough to answer her honestly, just as I would any <br/>
adult. <br/>
<br/>
So anyway, that&#39;s us.  I&#39;ve enjoyed being here, learning from all of <br/>
you, and I&#39;m looking forward to reading/learning even more here.  <br/>
Thanks for having me!<br/>
<br/>

I do recommend watching with the captions on until you get the Austen-speak  <br/>
down.<br/>
 <br/>
Oh, and welcome Paige!  I &quot;know&quot; you a bit from Shine.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1970836167">Hi, Leslie!<br/>
   <br/>
  Thanks for recommending &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;...I just put it on hold with my library. I&#39;m trying to find other films with Colin Firth...I recorded &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot;, so maybe we&#39;ll give that a shot.<br/>
   <br/>
  I just love watching British films/actors, and it&#39;s a really good way for Shel and I to connect after the little ones have gone to bed, or are otherwise occupied.  One of my faves is &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;, directed by Ang Lee, who did &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot; (AND &quot;The Ice Storm&quot; which is beautifully filmed).  What a cool thing that &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; stars Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant, Kate Winslet (all faves here) AND Alan Rickman!  Gotta love these connections...they&#39;re EVERYWHERE!<br/>
   <br/>
  Shelby has been talking about England A LOT recently.  She&#39;s got ME all excited about it...books, movies, music...she says she&#39;d like to visit there one day.  Who knows...maybe it&#39;ll happen!<br/>

 <br/>
I know you will enjoy P&P!<br/>
 <br/>
I think I&#39;ve learned most of my European history/culture from Brit  films.  <br/>
They are much more liberal with the &quot;f&quot; word, so they tend to get R  ratings <br/>
here.  But if you can get over that  I recommend &quot;Billy  Elliott&quot; which is about <br/>
a striking coalminer&#39;s son that is born to be a  dancer.....great movie.  <br/>
Also, &quot;Impromptu&quot;, the story of Chopin&#39;s (early  Hugh Grant) affair with the <br/>
female writer Georges Sands (nom de plume). I  haven&#39;t seen it for awhile, so I <br/>
can&#39;t remember anything to be aware  of.   And &quot;Room with a View&quot; (no f-word but <br/>
full frontal male nudity  when the men go for a swim).  It has Maggie Smith, <br/>
a.k.a. Professor  McGonnigal!  In a way, a great unschooling movie as it about <br/>
living with  passion and being true to oneself.<br/>
 <br/>
I still haven&#39;t seen the Ice Storm, will put that on my Netflix  queue!<br/>
 <br/>
Have fun!  Leslie in SC<br/>
