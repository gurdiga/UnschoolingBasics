<div id="ygrps-yiv-653929043">Hi there! My name is Jenna and I have started a fan page on Facebook that is helping connect unschooled familes with unschooled au pairs/nannies. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#!">http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#!</a>/pages/Unschooled-Au-Pair/123863...  I started this page because when I started looking for an au pair to help me with my son I realized that there wasn&#39;t anywhere to specifically find someone that had knowledge of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
What we do is we get some background information from both the families and people looking to be au pairs. We then send the family the potential matches we recieve and they can then contact the au pairs.<br/>
<br/>
This is an amazing experience for both the families and the au pairs. The families have the opportunity to learn from the au pairs and their past experiences with unschooling while the au pairs get to travel, live in a new city (or country!), and have a new life adventure! In the end everyone gets to learn through the experience!<br/>
<br/>
Please email me if you are looking for the adventure of a lifetime at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jennamiller28@...">jennamiller28@...</a> or visit us on our fan page <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#!">http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#!</a>/pages/Unschooled-Au-Pair/123863... <br/>
<br/>
Have a wonderful day!<br/>
