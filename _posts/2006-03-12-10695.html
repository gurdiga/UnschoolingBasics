<div id="ygrps-yiv-220076864">My best friend and I have completely different parenting styles.  She is<br/>
pretty nit-picky (though I give her some grace because she has 3 kids and<br/>
does this alone... the ex is in another state) and more controling.  I even<br/>
think she still spanks.... eekkk.  We just don&#39;t make our parenting styles<br/>
an issue in our friendship.  She knows I don&#39;t think spanking is Biblical...<br/>
 and I&#39;ve even said to her... &quot;man, our parenting styles are so different.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;ve never told her she should or shouldn&#39;t do something with her kids<br/>
and she&#39;s never done that to me.  That&#39;s respect and love at it&#39;s finest. <br/>
When two people can be great friends because of their common values and<br/>
interests and look past the differences.<br/>

<br/>
I have friends that don&#39;t unschool, some that unschool but control<br/>
several things we don&#39;t, I never felt like it was my place to tell<br/>
them how to do things unless they asked. I do share bits and pieces<br/>
when appropriate of course.<br/>
<br/>
Last week a Mom commented that she doesn&#39;t allow violent video games<br/>
in their home and I said &quot;we don&#39;t control our children&#39;s choices&quot;.<br/>
I told her what WE did, not what SHE should do.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think one important aspect of unschooling/learning/life is learning<br/>
that other people have different boundaries and sensitivities than we<br/>
do and how to respect that.  Going into someone elses home, or car<br/>
means some things will be different than in our own home...unschooler<br/>
or not.<br/>
If she&#39;s modeling to her child, that THEIR values should be imposed on<br/>
other people wherever they go, that&#39;s not a great skill at getting<br/>
along in this life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1062636926">I even think she still spanks.... eekkk.  We just don&#39;t make our parenting styles an issue in our friendship.  <br/>
   <br/>
  *****<br/>
   <br/>
  If I had a close friend who spanked -- or even if I suspected she spanked -- I&#39;d have to say something.  When my sister mentioned spanking her kids I told her exactly how I feel about it.  This past week, her son has been visiting (he&#39;s 14).  Somehow in conversation he said &quot;I mean, I wouldn&#39;t hurt my kid, but if he did [whatever we were discussing] I&#39;d smack him.&quot;  I told him hitting is not okay.  No matter how gently, or how much you love a child.  It&#39;s not okay to hit adults; it&#39;s not okay to hit children. Period. <br/>
   <br/>
  I couldn&#39;t consider it peaceful living if I knew my friend&#39;s kids (my friends by extension at the very least) were being hurt by someone who is supposed to love them unconditionally.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One of my best friends and I have been friends for over 20 years,  <br/>
since college, and we were even lovers for awhile in our twenties.  <br/>
When she had a baby but I hadn&#39;t had my first yet, we were driving in  <br/>
the car together one day, reminiscing. I said, &quot;Wow, we&#39;ve been  <br/>
friends for so long and been through so much...it&#39;s really hard to  <br/>
imagine anything that could end our friendship now.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She said, &quot;Radically different parenting philosophies.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know...aren&#39;t there times you have to say something? This  <br/>
particular friend and I generally take a hands-off approach to each  <br/>
other&#39;s parenting, but when her son was a toddler she and her partner  <br/>
were having to swap his car seat from one car to another twice a day  <br/>
(one driving him to day care, the other picking him up). I was  <br/>
staying with them for a week and noticed several times that the car  <br/>
seat wasn&#39;t installed properly--the seatbelt holding it hadn&#39;t been  <br/>
sufficiently tightened, so the seat was sitting there loosely. I  <br/>
finally said to her, &quot;I know we have agreed not to criticize each  <br/>
other&#39;s parenting, but I feel very worried for Noah when I see that  <br/>
his car seat has not been properly installed.&quot; She said, &quot;You&#39;re  <br/>
right. We&#39;re being sloppy with it because we&#39;re always in such a  <br/>
hurry, but it&#39;s really important and we&#39;ll do better.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess it depends on which things are core values. I think my friend  <br/>
was right--how we choose to parent seems to me to be reflective of  <br/>
core values. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d break up with a friend over  <br/>
spanking...but I don&#39;t know whether I could just let it be, either.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-149650977">You know, we just got done with discussing this thing that happened to<br/>
Shannon.... with this other unschooling mom forcing her views onto her.  How<br/>
is the fact that I don&#39;t micromanage how my friend parents any different?<br/>
<br/>
She knows how I feel about certain issues and that&#39;s enough for me.  If she<br/>
wants to know more about my POV then she&#39;ll ask.  And she&#39;ll feel more like<br/>
asking knowing that I&#39;m not going to jump down her throat if we don&#39;t agree.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
She could easily be like that chick that jumped down Shannon&#39;s throat as<br/>
easily as I could be to her.  That&#39;s the easy way out.  That way of handling<br/>
life is rude and uncalled for.  I acted like that when I was a teenager...<br/>
it&#39;s not how I conduct myself now.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling views are not popular in the Christian community at large... and<br/>
storming my way through life saying...&quot;its my way or the highway.... you&#39;re<br/>
wrong and I&#39;m right and I don&#39;t see how you could blindly live your lives<br/>
that way&quot;... that&#39;s just not the way to change anyone&#39;s mind about an issue.<br/>
 I certainly think those things to myself a lot...but I don&#39;t say them out<br/>
loud that way.  Change is tough for a lot of people and I know that... so I<br/>
try to show and express peacefulness in my views, not forcefulness.<br/>
<br/>
I can easily express that we do things differently in our home but I will<br/>
never tell someone else that they should things differently in theirs.  Like<br/>
I said when discussion what happened to Shannon, when does unschooling give<br/>
anyone the right to force their views onto someone else?  That is what I<br/>
meant when I titled this thread Peaceful Living.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Never? There is no circumstance under which you would feel you should  <br/>
intervene in how a mother is treating her children? Never? That is  <br/>
scary to me. Life could be pretty non-peaceful for somebody&#39;s kids  <br/>
while you and I are living under our non-intervention pact!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d also say--there are plenty of ways to discuss differences or  <br/>
intervene that fall way short of giving somebody a lecture on all the  <br/>
things she&#39;s doing wrong! When I spoke to my friend about  my  <br/>
concerns about her son&#39;s carseat not being properly installed, I  <br/>
said, &quot;I feel scared and worried when Noah isn&#39;t secured in the car.&quot;  <br/>
That&#39;s all I said. I chose to tell her about my feelings. I didn&#39;t  <br/>
tell her she had to do anything differently. And I didn&#39;t go on to  <br/>
say, &quot;And while I&#39;m on the subject, here&#39;s a list of the other dozen  <br/>
things I think you&#39;re doing wrong as a mother....&quot; as that woman did  <br/>
to Shannon.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps nobody does have the right to &quot;force&quot; their views. But  <br/>
opening a discussion is not necessarily &quot;forcing.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
I will tell abusers, rapists and mean spirited people they should do<br/>
things differently. I have NO problem calling out bad behavior.<br/>
Differences in opinion are one thing, harmful behavior is another.<br/>
<br/>
There is a big difference between trying to ramrod your views on<br/>
someone and letting them know what you believe in. Apathy isn&#39;t<br/>
exactly the best way to help  someone either.<br/>
<br/>
You can help people see there is a different way to do things in such<br/>
a way that they know exactly what you stand for, without saying &quot;you<br/>
should do what I do&quot;. Saying nothing is equivalent to agreement in my<br/>
book. I have a very diverse group of friends, including school<br/>
teachers, folks from various religions etc...and I would not tell them<br/>
to do anything different. BUT, when it comes to harming a child, I<br/>
feel a bit differently about being an advocate. Who advocates for the<br/>
vulnerable in our society? Who advocates for the helpless?<br/>
<br/>
I think we can all be gentle advocates.<br/>
