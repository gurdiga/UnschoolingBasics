<div id="ygrps-yiv-86045154">unschoolingbasicsI had to look it up. I wonder how many<br/>
elementary kids could answer THAT. ;)<br/>
***********<br/>
To me, the important part of this is that you had the interest and took the time, and had the time, to look it up.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody can answer all the questions we might think of. <br/>
<br/>
But knowing how to go find the answer is a great way to be in the world! <br/>
<br/>
And thanks for the info on carrots -- otherwise I would have had to go look it up! :) Thank goodness for Google! <br/>
