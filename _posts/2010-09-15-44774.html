<div id="ygrps-yiv-1964097640">Yes! Me snarling at other drivers as a younger mom in annoying traffic was not fun for the kids as a captive audience, and we were in the car a LOT. It wasn&#39;t helping me enjoy our life either. I consciously made a game of my running commentary about traffic, asking little DD to help me think up silly awards to bestow on each driver.  &quot;Look, it must be Pull Out in Front of Mama Day again, here&#39;s the first contestant in the yellow beetle car!  Will he win or have to settle for the Cutest Car Consolation Prize when this lawn mowing trailer takes the cake?!&quot;  Soon DD was doing the commentary for me, like radio sportscasting and kept me laughing too hard to mind the traffic at all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-718818460">Thanks to those that replied about handling anger better. Using humour is such a great idea, as is letting go the control more. <br/>
<br/>
I can see that most times I get angry or try to coerce dd (3 y.o.) is related to fearing others&#39; judgements of me. This afternoon she started falling asleep in the car at 4pm (which made perfect sense for her) but I got angry about it because I arranged for us to drive to visit relatives tomorrow and I fear what they would think of me (as a parent and a person) if we are both exhausted from staying up late (which tends to happen if she naps in the afternoon). I sometimes try to coerce her to wear a clean shirt or put on shoes, simply because of what others might think, when I honestly don&#39;t think it&#39;s important and I trust her to do what she needs to now. <br/>
<br/>
I can see the effects of my anger is to give a powerful message about her not being acceptable / worthy, and that she&#39;d better do what I expect and do it before I get angry (i.e., anticipate what might bother me and do what will please me). That, I can now see, is what I experienced as a child, and I continue to go on trying to anticipate and meet expectations and avoid judgement, even though I very much have chosen my own path, it&#39;s something I struggle with a lot. I really don&#39;t want to give dd this message, I want to raise her fully free and loved, unlike how I was raised. argh!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway I&#39;m really trying to unravel those inner messages about meeting my Mum&#39;s and others expectations. Seeing as they bind me and lead to my anger which may bind dd. grr. <br/>
<br/>
Any encouraging comments about how to overcome wanting to meet others&#39; expectations, or let go of childhood messages, would be great.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why is what they think so important to you? I have had to ask myself that question more times that I would like to admit. How will your relatives know that you were deliberately up late? If you are exhausted, can&#39;t you just say, &quot;We had a rough night&quot; and leave it at that. I find that I can avoid a lot of questions and judgment by minimizing how much detail I share with others. Even mainstream moms have had days where kids have fallen asleep in the car, which resulted in a later bed time. A lot of that kind of thing can be avoided by advance planning. We don&#39;t go out before noon so that everyone can sleep until they are ready to wake up. If I know the kids are going to fall asleep in the car and I don&#39;t want them to, I try to find ways to avoid the car all together. If my daughter doesn&#39;t want to put on a clean shirt, I think about where we are going and how necessary it is for her to have on a clean shirt. I have found that keeping outings to later in the day allows my kids to go out without putting on the clean shirt. For some reason, if you are out late in the day, people don&#39;t look twice at a kid with a dirty shirt. Also, I carry extra clothes with me in the car so I can change their clothes if necessary. Also, it gives me an out because I can always tell people, &quot;I have a clean shirt in the diaper bag/car&quot; if somebody expresses concern. I really doubt that a stranger would pry that much. If they do, then you can ignore them or simply walk away. I have gotten really good and smiling and nodding or pretending that I didn&#39;t hear what they were saying. I always have a pair of shoes in the car so that I can put them in my purse or carry them if we are going somewhere that requires shoes. If anybody says anything or looks twice, I can point to the shoes sticking out of the bag. : -)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You cannot avoid judgment. Even mainstream parents that use coercive techniques to get their children to comply are judged. As a parent, you will constantly be judged by everyone around you no matter what path you have chosen. There will always be somebody that disagrees with what you are doing no matter what your choices are. I don&#39;t think that it is possible to be truly free. Instead of putting that kind of pressure on my child, we avoid places that require them to act beyond their years. If we do go, then we always build in a back up plan. For example, I will only take all 4 kids shopping if I have another adult with me because I never know when my 20 month old or 3 year old will get tired and want to run. When that happens, the other adult can take the kids to the car so they can snack and play in the car. We don&#39;t take the two little ones to restaurants or any other place where people will expect them to behave or be quiet. I can take my older two (6 &9) pretty much anywhere because we talk about the behavioral expectations beforehand. When we went to see my dad in a play, they knew that they had to dress a certain way and behave a certain way at the theater. If they did not want to dress appropriately or be courteous, then they would have had the option of not going. If visiting family members is too stressful for you or your child, then don&#39;t do it. Give yourself permission to say yes to your child and no to the rest of the world. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-207796921">I know exactly how you feel. I bullied and bribed, yelled and cried to get my kids to prove to others that &quot;I&quot; was a good mom. The issue was that I really didn&#39;t (and sometimes still don&#39;t) believe that I was was good enough. <br/>
I never wanted my kids to ever worry about what others thought. I didn&#39;t know how I could stop worrying about other&#39;s opinions, and so I passed on those feelings of not being good enough and trying to be perfect to them. We are all slowly learning to stand up for ourselves and our principles.<br/>
In our case it took a huge family problem to give my husband and I the kick in the pants we needed to stop living for others and to start living for ourselves and our kids. We resolved to stop pretending and start being upfront with people. If they didn&#39;t like it they didn&#39;t have to be around us. I still have one or two family members who think grades are the only things that matter in life. (One of them in particular thinks Facebook and online banking will ruin you life forever.) I just say if you don&#39;t want to listen to what I have to say about whatever we&#39;re talking about (usually unschooling) then go look it up yourself or zip it!<br/>
My case is drastic as we don&#39;t speak to half the family anymore over preferential and racist behaviour. But the result of dealing with that is that we won&#39;t allow people&#39;s judgement to affect us anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry that was a bit long and probably confusing. That&#39;s just how we came to not care about what other people think of our family. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-996111344">Encouraging messages? Hmm. . . keep on caring less about what the relatives think.<br/>
<br/>
And now you can worry about what happens when you raise this lovely child to think for herself and she declares that she doesn&#39;t want to go visit mean Gramma. That&#39;s not a bad time really -- it&#39;s a good time for you to tell Gramma she brought it on herself by being too rigid. And maybe she will lighten up. Or not. <br/>
<br/>
At any rate, keep on moving in the direction of being comfortable with your own choices and those of your daughter, no matter what Gramma and the neighbors think. It really is a fun way to live. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-399437314">This whole thread reminds me of the conflict model of social influence.  In<br/>
this model there are high power members and low power members.  Since we are<br/>
talking about families, we&#39;d say that traditionally, the parents are the<br/>
high power members and the children are the low power members, regardless of<br/>
age.  A high power member is someone who has the capacity to have<br/>
considerable influence on another&#39;s outcomes.  A low power member has very<br/>
little influence on another&#39;s outcomes.<br/>
<br/>
More than this, high power members (keep in mind here your {the rhetorical<br/>
you} relationships with your kids and parents etc..) have lives that seem<br/>
generally very good.  Everything seems to go well, every problem is easily<br/>
solved and everyone seems to like and appreciate them.  High power members<br/>
do not deal well or benevolently when this is disrupted by a low power<br/>
member.  (Hence why grandmothers don&#39;t like it when their children don&#39;t<br/>
parent their grandkids the way they think it should be done.)  When low<br/>
power members express dissatisfaction, high power members attempt to protect<br/>
their superior power by rejecting demands for change and being uninterested<br/>
in learning about the intentions and plans of low power members, being<br/>
inattentive to the communications of the low power person and being<br/>
unresponsive to cooperative gestures by the low power members.  They usually<br/>
are hard to move toward cooperation, conciliation and compromise, and they<br/>
will largely ignore the efforts of their low power individuals to increase<br/>
cooperative problem solving.  They attempt to protect their superior power<br/>
by rejecting demands for change.  High power individuals tend to be more<br/>
angered by a lower power person&#39;s harm or insult than when positions are<br/>
reversed.  Aristotle said &quot;people think it right that they should be revered<br/>
by those inferior to them.&quot;   And high power persons find it particularly<br/>
vexing to be insulted or harmed by someone who should actually treat them<br/>
with deference.  To them low power persons do not &quot;know their place&quot; and<br/>
insist on &quot;rocking the boat&quot; out of ignorance and spite.<br/>
<br/>
Once a group member gains power, they tend to establish regulations and<br/>
norms to legitimize their position and privileges and make illegitimate any<br/>
attempt by others to change the status quo.  This strategy can be defined as<br/>
the &quot;power defines justice&quot; strategy or the &quot;might makes right&quot; strategy.<br/>
In addition, high power members tend to make the risk of attempting to<br/>
change the power status quo so great that low power members are deterred<br/>
from trying to do so.  They do so in two ways: by establishing severe<br/>
penalties for those who attempt to change the status quo and by offering low<br/>
power members a variety of benefits as long as they do not rebel.  The<br/>
latter seems to be more effective.  The severe penalties strategy may be<br/>
characterized as the &quot;this-hurts-me-more-than-it-will-hurt-you&quot;strategy or<br/>
the &quot;if-only-you-would-behave-neither-of-us-would-go-through-this-suffering&quot;<br/>
strategy.  The benefits strategy would be bribing.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the power-devaluation theory rolls in here because it posits that as a<br/>
person&#39;s power increases, they will make more attempts to influence others.<br/>
As more influence attempts are made, the person comes to believe that they<br/>
can control the lower power peoples&#39; behavior and is the causal agent in<br/>
producing the outcomes.  The performances of low power people are devalued<br/>
and the high powered person takes responsibility for any successes<br/>
associated with the work of the lower power members.  Also high power<br/>
members tend to devalue low power members and this is reflected in them<br/>
being uninterested in learning about the intentions and plans of low power<br/>
members, less cooperative and more exploitative in response to the low power<br/>
members&#39; cooperation and less likely to make concessions in negotiations.<br/>
High power members also see themselves as being entitled to a larger share<br/>
of available resources due to their superior value.<br/>
<br/>
So in a traditional family we can see that parents expect kids to<br/>
&quot;toe-the-line&quot; and to react very badly when they do not.  And while parents<br/>
can and do come up with all kinds of reasons why they have to do what they<br/>
do (ie: a spanking for not sitting quietly during dinner because they have<br/>
to learn manners) the real reason is that they are reacting to the challenge<br/>
to their authority by a member they consider lower power and less valuable<br/>
than themselves.  I know when I came to this realization that this is what I<br/>
was REALLY doing to my kids and not any of the benevolent horse-pucky I was<br/>
convinced I was doing it for I had no choice but to change my behavior<br/>
because there was no way I could look into the face of my children and say<br/>
in my head &quot;You are not worth as much as I am.&quot;  It was a powerful and<br/>
painful revelation.  Once I had this idea firmly in my head.  I could see<br/>
how my interactions with other members of my family, my parents, in-laws<br/>
etc...were really about power and who expected what.  It was much easier to<br/>
move around, and in some cases through, these issues because I knew what the<br/>
motivation was behind the conflicts even if the other person didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
And further, I knew that the lessons I wanted my kids to learn were not<br/>
about manners or forks, or seat belts.  I wanted them to learn respect and<br/>
value and the ability to value others for who they were, and not to see<br/>
people in terms of a power value.  The ONLY way that was going to happen was<br/>
to stop seeing us a members with differential power bases.  Because that is<br/>
not a lesson one can learn from teaching...it has to be modeled.  And I knew<br/>
I had to model it for the rest of my kids&#39; lives, (or mine I guess) in order<br/>
for it to be an authentic message.  I had to live the way I wanted the world<br/>
to work, at least for my family if not for the world at large.  In the end,<br/>
it doesn&#39;t matter if the dish is put in the dishwasher...and it is NOT a<br/>
challenge to my authority (either real or imagined) if it&#39;s not put in the<br/>
dishwasher.  But me coming behind them and putting it in for them cheerfully<br/>
and lovingly DOES leave a lasting impression.  And that&#39;s the one I want to<br/>
leave.  Not me as dictator.<br/>
<br/>
YMMV<br/>

The process of writing, and some of your comments, have, I think, helped me make a mental shift that I was really struggling with (time will tell, but it feels like a change has occurred, and I haven&#39;t been much bothered in situations that were triggering me 2 days ago). The range of comments, from personal to practical to psychological, helped, thank you. They validated, reinforced and furthered my ideas, and gave me some practical ways to handle some situations. I hadn&#39;t quite clicked that I was choosing others opinions instead of dd&#39;s (I thought it was instead of my own) - she definitely comes first in most instances. More than that, I needed to hear some ways to handle it, and some clarity that judgements can&#39;t be avoided, sometimes real divisions are needed, and power play is going on.

&gt; little influence on another&#39;s outcomes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; More than this, high power members (keep in mind here your {the rhetorical<br/>
&gt; you} relationships with your kids and parents etc..) have lives that seem<br/>
&gt; generally very good.  Everything seems to go well, every problem is easily<br/>
&gt; solved and everyone seems to like and appreciate them.  High power members<br/>
&gt; do not deal well or benevolently when this is disrupted by a low power<br/>
&gt; member.  (Hence why grandmothers don&#39;t like it when their children don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; parent their grandkids the way they think it should be done.)  When low<br/>
&gt; power members express dissatisfaction, high power members attempt to protect<br/>
&gt; their superior power by rejecting demands for change and being uninterested<br/>
&gt; in learning about the intentions and plans of low power members, being<br/>
&gt; inattentive to the communications of the low power person and being<br/>
&gt; unresponsive to cooperative gestures by the low power members.  They usually<br/>
&gt; are hard to move toward cooperation, conciliation and compromise, and they<br/>
&gt; will largely ignore the efforts of their low power individuals to increase<br/>
&gt; cooperative problem solving.  They attempt to protect their superior power<br/>
&gt; by rejecting demands for change.  High power individuals tend to be more<br/>
&gt; angered by a lower power person&#39;s harm or insult than when positions are<br/>
&gt; reversed.  Aristotle said &quot;people think it right that they should be revered<br/>
&gt; by those inferior to them.&quot;   And high power persons find it particularly<br/>
&gt; vexing to be insulted or harmed by someone who should actually treat them<br/>
&gt; with deference.  To them low power persons do not &quot;know their place&quot; and<br/>
&gt; insist on &quot;rocking the boat&quot; out of ignorance and spite.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Once a group member gains power, they tend to establish regulations and<br/>
&gt; norms to legitimize their position and privileges and make illegitimate any<br/>
&gt; attempt by others to change the status quo.  This strategy can be defined as<br/>
&gt; the &quot;power defines justice&quot; strategy or the &quot;might makes right&quot; strategy.<br/>
&gt; In addition, high power members tend to make the risk of attempting to<br/>
&gt; change the power status quo so great that low power members are deterred<br/>
&gt; from trying to do so.  They do so in two ways: by establishing severe<br/>
&gt; penalties for those who attempt to change the status quo and by offering low<br/>
&gt; power members a variety of benefits as long as they do not rebel.  The<br/>
&gt; latter seems to be more effective.  The severe penalties strategy may be<br/>
&gt; characterized as the &quot;this-hurts-me-more-than-it-will-hurt-you&quot;strategy or<br/>
&gt; the &quot;if-only-you-would-behave-neither-of-us-would-go-through-this-suffering&quot;<br/>
&gt; strategy.  The benefits strategy would be bribing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, the power-devaluation theory rolls in here because it posits that as a<br/>
&gt; person&#39;s power increases, they will make more attempts to influence others.<br/>
&gt; As more influence attempts are made, the person comes to believe that they<br/>
&gt; can control the lower power peoples&#39; behavior and is the causal agent in<br/>
&gt; producing the outcomes.  The performances of low power people are devalued<br/>
&gt; and the high powered person takes responsibility for any successes<br/>
&gt; associated with the work of the lower power members.  Also high power<br/>
&gt; members tend to devalue low power members and this is reflected in them<br/>
&gt; being uninterested in learning about the intentions and plans of low power<br/>
&gt; members, less cooperative and more exploitative in response to the low power<br/>
&gt; members&#39; cooperation and less likely to make concessions in negotiations.<br/>
&gt; High power members also see themselves as being entitled to a larger share<br/>
&gt; of available resources due to their superior value.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So in a traditional family we can see that parents expect kids to<br/>
&gt; &quot;toe-the-line&quot; and to react very badly when they do not.  And while parents<br/>
&gt; can and do come up with all kinds of reasons why they have to do what they<br/>
&gt; do (ie: a spanking for not sitting quietly during dinner because they have<br/>
&gt; to learn manners) the real reason is that they are reacting to the challenge<br/>
&gt; to their authority by a member they consider lower power and less valuable<br/>
&gt; than themselves.  I know when I came to this realization that this is what I<br/>
&gt; was REALLY doing to my kids and not any of the benevolent horse-pucky I was<br/>
&gt; convinced I was doing it for I had no choice but to change my behavior<br/>
&gt; because there was no way I could look into the face of my children and say<br/>
&gt; in my head &quot;You are not worth as much as I am.&quot;  It was a powerful and<br/>
&gt; painful revelation.  Once I had this idea firmly in my head.  I could see<br/>
&gt; how my interactions with other members of my family, my parents, in-laws<br/>
&gt; etc...were really about power and who expected what.  It was much easier to<br/>
&gt; move around, and in some cases through, these issues because I knew what the<br/>
&gt; motivation was behind the conflicts even if the other person didn&#39;t.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And further, I knew that the lessons I wanted my kids to learn were not<br/>
&gt; about manners or forks, or seat belts.  I wanted them to learn respect and<br/>
&gt; value and the ability to value others for who they were, and not to see<br/>
&gt; people in terms of a power value.  The ONLY way that was going to happen was<br/>
&gt; to stop seeing us a members with differential power bases.  Because that is<br/>
&gt; not a lesson one can learn from teaching...it has to be modeled.  And I knew<br/>
&gt; I had to model it for the rest of my kids&#39; lives, (or mine I guess) in order<br/>
&gt; for it to be an authentic message.  I had to live the way I wanted the world<br/>
&gt; to work, at least for my family if not for the world at large.  In the end,<br/>
&gt; it doesn&#39;t matter if the dish is put in the dishwasher...and it is NOT a<br/>
&gt; challenge to my authority (either real or imagined) if it&#39;s not put in the<br/>
&gt; dishwasher.  But me coming behind them and putting it in for them cheerfully<br/>
&gt; and lovingly DOES leave a lasting impression.  And that&#39;s the one I want to<br/>
&gt; leave.  Not me as dictator.<br/>

I&#39;m not 100% &quot;proofed&quot; (dog training term for a dog that will do the thing<br/>

Re: kids and parents and value/power.  The absolute truth is that you do<br/>
have more power than your kids.  It&#39;s a fact.  You control the resources.<br/>
And even if you are fair with your kids, they can&#39;t own a house, drive a<br/>
car, have a credit card, or hold a job.  So some of the recognizing that you<br/>
are more powerful is a societal and age thing.  A construct of the culture<br/>
we live in.  You can&#39;t take the blame for that.  You can however, not use it<br/>
to your advantage.  And there is the rub!<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t be so hard on yourself.  It&#39;s hard to undo enculturation and<br/>
conditioning.  That&#39;s why they work so well in getting us all to<br/>
toe-the-line.  Being willing to admit that you have made mistakes and then<br/>
try to repair those mistakes is just as important because it models<br/>
something else for your kids...that adults are not infallible and that the<br/>
good ones own their mistakes.<br/>

You don&#39;t have to take Karen&#39;s word for it: you can go back to the archives (Oct 2007) and read her struggles. You&#39;ll find that a lot of the trusted writers here started out *just* where you are. You know you&#39;ve *got* it when you can speak/write comfortably about unschooling---not that you never make mistakes, but that you really get it and can ask your children for forgiveness. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If the archives for unschoooling.com were still available, you could read my (just a few) and Ren&#39;s (a lot) struggles. Just know that, if you take baby steps every day---just small ones at first---the steps soon become leaps. Then it&#39;s second nature!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What do you gain when you fall off the wagon? What other need is being  <br/>
met? You must be gaining something that&#39;s important to you otherwise  <br/>
you wouldn&#39;t keep doing it.<br/>
<br/>
If you can dig into that, figure out what that other goal is -- or  <br/>
fear -- and why it&#39;s important, then you can work at dismantling it,  <br/>
work at finding ways to see that it&#39;s not as important as some fear is  <br/>
making it seem, or find other ways to meet it that don&#39;t get in the  <br/>
way of your goal to unschool and build relationships with your family.<br/>
<br/>
If knowledge alone were enough to let go of a need/fear/goal that was  <br/>
interfering with another goal, no one would be eating to excess,  <br/>
avoiding exercise, continuing to smoke, procrastinating. There&#39;s  <br/>
certainly plenty of information on the benefits of not doing those.  <br/>
But until someone tackles the root cause, or finds a reason that makes  <br/>
the other goal way more important, they&#39;ll keep slipping back into  <br/>
whatever behavior is comforting them.<br/>
<br/>
An example is that some people need organization. They need a plan and  <br/>
they need everyone to cooperate. That&#39;s obviously a need that will get  <br/>
in the way of unschooling! The solution won&#39;t be one thing but a  <br/>
combination of many actions, liking finding something else to organize  <br/>
(like supplies or an unshooling group :-), like focusing on very  <br/>
specific things you love about each of your kids, like reading books  <br/>
that focus you on the goal your head is saying you want so your  <br/>
emotions can shift to where your head is.<br/>

 <br/>
Control.  <br/>
<br/>
If I dismantle that, then yes, my ability to be organised is where the foundation for my Need for control lies.  I Do spend a lot of time with the kids, but my mind certainly is on other things, for the most part.  When at home, I find it hard to drop things (although I do!) and get involved in the kids&#39; activites.  To combat this, I remove myself from the home a LOT.  Lots of outings, so I am both physically and mentally removed from &#39;tempation&#39; - to do the dishes, vacuum, etc.  This works to everyones benefit.  My house is a mess . . . to my standards, anyway.  Unschooling helped me a looong time ago to shift my perspective on the value of household duties, and I undertake it happily.  But it&#39;s still there!    <br/>
<br/>
Deeper that the actual &#39;doing&#39; of stuff, I have this constant internal chatter about how much I need to &#39;be&#39; with the kids; truly present, for unschooling to really reach that level of &#39;success&#39;.  There are moments when I am truly &#39;with&#39; them.  It&#39;s like meditation; when you are aware you are &#39;doing it&#39;, you&#39;re out if it!  I literally tell myself, &#39;be present, be present&#39;.  It all kinda feels false/forced?  <br/>

<br/>
I like this - I do tend to get frustrated with myself.  I often think, if I have the knowledge, then what&#39;s the problem?  Application should be easy, if you have a sound understanding of the &#39;why&#39;.  I have such a sense of urgency to &#39;get it right&#39;, because they are only little for such a short time.    <br/>

Wow.  That book sounds perfect.  Thanks for the recommendation.  I need to chill out with it all, and I just feel too bloody militant in the mind.  Militant and unschooling - two terms that just don&#39;t work well together!<br/>
