Rue,<br/>
<br/>
I totally agree.  Your book is so nourishing to a new unschoolers heart.  I<br/>
have been looking forward to reading it every night and I am almost done.<br/>
My husband has been asking for a book to read--and I have changed my mind<br/>
about 10 times about which book to give him (I&#39;ve probably read about 30 so<br/>
far).  This is it!  Your book is full of thoughtful, loving wisdom.  I love<br/>
that you have no axe to grind--just the simple truth of your joyous life.<br/>
Thank you so much.<br/>
<br/>
gratefully,<br/>
<br/>
Jena Walter<br/>

Does anyone know, is it best to fly into St. Louis for the conference?<br/>
 <br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
There is a small airport in O&#39;Fallon, IL. But it&#39;s new, and I have no personal experience with it. <br/>
Lambert Field (St Louis Airport) is the major hub and where the speakers are flying into. <br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
And is there a Days Inn nearby? <br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
I have no idea. There&#39;s a Drury, a Ramada, a Fairfield, and a Hampton all within walking distance.<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
 What are the best days to go if I can<br/>
only go for 3 of the 4?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
You might want to take a look at the schedule and find what suits your family best. <br/>
The funshop schedule *should* be up TODAY!<br/>

 <br/>
Cheryl&#39;s been up to her ears with getting the handbook to the printer. She will have it up as soon as she can!<br/>
 <br/>
It will be on the schedule page, broken down by days and hours and rooms.<br/>
