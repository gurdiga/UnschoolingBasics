<div id="ygrps-yiv-1786709756">Hello!<br/>
<br/>
My name is Jonell and I live in the mtns of southern california with<br/>
dh of 7yrs.  I have two little guys: Ben who is 4 and Nick who will<br/>
be 1 next month.  I found this group from the alwayslearning group.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve come to believe that unschooling is the best thing for my kids,<br/>
and the more I read about it the more and more of an advocate I<br/>
become.  My family think I&#39;m nuts.  My friends think I&#39;ve gone off<br/>
the deep end.  Even my dh sometimes needs a good talking to about<br/>
what I want (or rather, don&#39;t want) for my kids in regard to school. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, my kids are not even old enough yet to go to school, even<br/>
if I wanted them to.  I&#39;ve just finished reading a ton of intros from<br/>
you guys, and I&#39;m so glad to have this list as a resourse as my kids<br/>
get older.  <br/>
<br/>
I live in a small mountain community where there are quite a few<br/>
homeschoolers.  Most of the hs&#39;ers I&#39;ve met so far (we moved here<br/>
last Oct.) are doing so for religious reasons.  Our town, pop. about<br/>
2500, has a school that is the &quot;best&quot; in our county.  When I voice my<br/>
intentions to unschool, I often get the comment, &quot;But the school here<br/>
isn&#39;t so bad...actually it&#39;s really great.&quot;  Which it is, if you are<br/>
willing to accept school as a logical choice for your kids.  What<br/>
bugs me most is that most of my friends haven&#39;t even really thought<br/>
about it.  They just assume, oh I went to school, so my kids will to,<br/>
as if there really is no choice.  But most of my friends HATED<br/>
school, even if they did well there.  Maybe they think there kids<br/>
should have to go through it and hate it just like they did?  I just<br/>
don&#39;t want to put Ben and Nick through all that baloney. <br/>
<br/>
My husband and I cannot find enough hours in the day to do all the<br/>
projects and pursue all of our interests.  We are always reading,<br/>
playing, singing....learning. I feel that school robbed me of the<br/>
ability to know what I want and I am just now reclaiming that<br/>
ability.  I&#39;m 34.  I will not send my children to an institution that<br/>
does not seem to have the best interests of children at heart.  The<br/>
best place they can be is here in the real world, with mom and dad.  <br/>
<br/>
Okay maybe I&#39;m preaching to the choir but I wanted to get that off my<br/>
chest.   <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Nancy,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to unschooling too, and my kids are Ben (4) and Nick (1).  I<br/>
have to tell you about the book, Deschooling our Lives, edited by<br/>
Matt Hern.  This book had a profound impact on me.  It is a<br/>
collection of essays about the history of school, the difference<br/>
between learning and education, and some alternative schools that<br/>
follow the &#39;democratic&#39; model (like sudbury valley, summerhill, and<br/>
albany). There are essays by Leo Tolstoy, Ivan Illich, John Holt,<br/>
Grace Lewellyn, John Taylor Gatto and others.   <br/>
<br/>
The section of the book about the history of schools and why they<br/>
evolved in the first place probably had the most impact in &quot;gelling&quot;<br/>
my decision to unschool.  It will also give you amunition to back up<br/>
your decision when people question you about your unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it was a big help to me and I often refer back to it when I<br/>
feel myself wondering if I am doing the right thing.  <br/>

I am just now reclaiming that ability. I&#39;m 34. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s &quot;funny&quot; that you would say that.  I am 33 and have been feeling <br/>
exactly the same way.  On that note I&#39;d like to ask a question for <br/>
discussion...<br/>
<br/>
My two oldest just finished their last day of high school on <br/>
Thursday.  They were public schooled all the way from beginning to so <br/>
called end.  Tabitha knows what she wants to do and has a plan.  Amy, <br/>
on the other hand, has no clue.  What advice would you give a child <br/>
in that situation?  <br/>
<br/>
I am currently reading &quot;The Teenage Liberation Handbook.&quot;  Do you <br/>
think it would benefit her to read something like that having gone <br/>
all the way through the system?  Oh how I wish she had found this <br/>
book years ago on her own!<br/>
<br/>
I raised her the same way that I was raised.  You go to school, <br/>
graduate and then go to college.  She has three years of Michigan <br/>
college paid for through MET, so it was the &quot;natural&quot; thing to do.  <br/>
It didn&#39;t work for me.  Don&#39;t ask me why I thought it would work for <br/>
my kids!  I just didn&#39;t know any different, and only arrived where <br/>
I&#39;m at within the past year or so.  <br/>
<br/>
My instinct is to tell her not to go to college right now.  Take some <br/>
time, find yourself, that sort of thing.  I&#39;d like to encourage her <br/>
to do some reading, but I don&#39;t really know what to tell her to <br/>
read.  Are there books out there that address this issue?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks - Tina</div>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Tina,<br/>
<br/>
My oldest is 20 and graduated from public school as per the usual at <br/>
18.  She&#39;s been sitting around for 2 years without a clue.  And I&#39;ve <br/>
let her because, frankly, I know exactly what she&#39;s going through.  <br/>
I&#39;m still getting through it myself!  And I&#39;m 38... it&#39;s only been <br/>
in the last year or so that I started having the gumption to pursue <br/>
my interests... and I&#39;m still crawling out.  I&#39;ve been allowing this <br/>
grown child to &quot;unschool&quot; along with my younger ones because she <br/>
needed it.  It&#39;s interesting as well.  Her latest?  She bought some <br/>
zoology and biology coloring books at B&N.  She has now expressed an <br/>
interest in signing up for biology this fall at college.  I don&#39;t <br/>
know where she&#39;ll end up or what she&#39;ll ultimately do, but for the <br/>
first time since she was 5, she actually seems to be interested in <br/>
something.  I wish I had found out about all this years ago.  I will <br/>
say that year after year while in school, she&#39;d have a spark of  <br/>
interest, take a class, and then all the joy would be sucked out of <br/>
it for her... it&#39;s been a sad journey for her.  She was quite an <br/>
artist - but year after year one teacher or another would crush her <br/>
because she didn&#39;t do the art the right way.  How do you not do art <br/>
the right way????  They didn&#39;t like her colors or her textures... <br/>
bunch of crap.  In the end she stopped it all together.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Tina,<br/>
<br/>
I remember feeling this way when I graduated from University!  I went<br/>
because it was expected (and paid for) by my parents.  I had no idea<br/>
what I wanted and changed majors at least 4 times.   I initially<br/>
wanted to do film, but my father laughed at me and told me I&#39;d never<br/>
make money doing that--it just wasn&#39;t practical (he&#39;s a doctor).  So<br/>
I ended up with a degree in philosophy and geography (double major),<br/>
which led me into computer mapping and technical writing...but that&#39;s<br/>
another story.<br/>
<br/>
What I wish had happened was this:  I wish I would have had the self<br/>
confidence to take some time to find myself, just like you say you<br/>
think Amy should do. Take a year or two and travel, work, explore the<br/>
world. Will the money for college still be there for her if she does<br/>
this?  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay Syndi.  History of school.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not an expert.  But here is what I&#39;ve discovered. <br/>
<br/>
According to John Gatto, modern day schools are structured on<br/>
Prussian schools that began in the early 1800s.  The soldiers of<br/>
Prussia were defeated by Napolean in 1806.  A german philosopeher<br/>
named Fichte addressed the German people and basically told them that<br/>
they would have to shape up.  His method was to use forced schooling<br/>
to teach everyone to take orders. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m paraphrasing this from &quot;Deschooling our Lives.&quot; It is from a talk<br/>
that John Taylor Gatto gave in 1991 called &quot;The Public School<br/>
Nightmare: Why fix a system designed to destroy individual thought?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He says:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;So the world got compulsion schooling at the end of a state bayonet<br/>
for the first time in human history; modern forced schooling started<br/>
in Prussia in 1819 with a clear vision of what centralized schools<br/>
could deliver:<br/>
<br/>
1) obedient soldiers to the army;<br/>
2) obedient workers to the mines;<br/>
3) well subordinated civil servants to government;<br/>
4) well subordinated clerks to industry;<br/>
5) citizens who thought alike about major issues.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The King of Prussia came to the U.S. in 1845 to determine the<br/>
boundary between the U.S. and Canada.  This is when the U.S. adopted<br/>
the Prussian style of schooling.  The Prussian purpose of schools was<br/>
to create a form a state socialism, and came to replace the American<br/>
purpose of schools which was to create independent thinkers.  <br/>
<br/>
When I read this stuff it blew my socks of.  I mean, it really<br/>
changed my whole view of schooling.  You should read this article. <br/>
Here is some more:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;There were many more techniques of training, but all were built<br/>
around the premise that isolation from first-had information, and<br/>
fragmentation of the abstract information presented by teachers,<br/>
would result in obedient and subordinate graduates, properly<br/>
respectful of arbitrary orders.  &quot;Lesser&quot; men would be unable to<br/>
interfere with policy makers because, while they could still<br/>
complain, they could not manage sustained or comprehensive thought.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s important to note that the underlying premise of Prussian<br/>
schooling is hat the government is the true parent of children--the<br/>
state is sovereign over the family.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When Friedrich Froebel, the inventor of kindergarten in 19th century<br/>
Germany, fashioned his idea, he did not have a &quot;garden for children&quot;<br/>
in mind, but a metaphor of teachers as gardeners and children as the<br/>
vegetables.  Kindergarten was created to be a way to break the<br/>
influence of mothers on their children....The movement toward state<br/>
socilaism is not some historical curiosity but a powerful dynamic<br/>
force in the world around us.  It is fighting for its life against<br/>
those forces which would...deprive it of financial lifeblood, and it<br/>
has countered this thrust with a demand for even more control over<br/>
children&#39;s lives, and even more money to pay for the extended school<br/>
day and year that this control requires.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I take out of reading this is that school really wasn&#39;t<br/>
created with the best interests of children in mind, and I don&#39;t<br/>
think this is the goal of schools today. It just isn&#39;t to the<br/>
advantage to those in power to have a population that can think for<br/>
itself.<br/>
<br/>
So many of my friends have kids that are aged 4-5 and are raving<br/>
about how excited they are to get their time back when the kids start<br/>
school.  It seems that school has become tax-funded daycare so that<br/>
moms and dads can work.  <br/>
<br/>
On a more personal level, since being a stay at home mom, I&#39;ve<br/>
thought about starting my own business.  After 17 years of school, I<br/>
have no idea of how to do about this.  But people are constantly<br/>
coming to America who can barely speak English and starting up shops<br/>
and restaurants and becoming successful.  I wonder what they think of<br/>
American schools?<br/>
<br/>
School didn&#39;t teach me how to make a living.  It taught me how to go<br/>
to someone else to give me a job.  The assumption seems to be that<br/>
you go out and find a job, you get hired by someone.  You don&#39;t go<br/>
out and make a job for yourself.  I blame the schools for making<br/>
children into employees.    <br/>
<br/>
This is just the tip of the iceberg.  I have to go now....I&#39;d love to<br/>
chat more about this though.  Does anyone else have input on the role<br/>
of the history of schools in their decision to unschool?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-840050993">Thanks for all the wonderful advice and input on this topic.  The <br/>
girls&#39; graduation is Tuesay.  Amy has not received her &quot;New Student <br/>
Packet&quot; in the mail yet, so she has to call MET next week to see <br/>
why.  I&#39;m going to have her ask them to send the particulars on how <br/>
it works and what happens to the money should she choose not to use <br/>
it.  <br/>
<br/>
I think that it&#39;s important for me to find the time to talk with her <br/>
to discuss how she&#39;s feeling and what she&#39;s thinking.  I know she&#39;s a <br/>
little &quot;afraid&quot; for a lack of better word.  She has stated that she <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to grow up.  I told her that I don&#39;t either.  :)  It&#39;s <br/>
definately time for a mom and daughter day out...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks - Tina</div>

   ((((hugs to your daughter))))) One of my biggest pet peeves right <br/>
here. Art is in the eye of the beholder and for them to take away <br/>
her passion like that just drives me insane. I hope she is getting <br/>
her passion back for art. Another one that would drive me bonkers <br/>
was gym class. to me everyone should come out with an A in that <br/>
class. some kids are just not athletically inclined and if they do <br/>
thier very best and at least try the activitiy (does not matter if <br/>
they can not get to teh top of the rope climb) but if they try thier <br/>
best that should be an A. I had a gym teacher tell me differently <br/>
once at conferences. That was the same year I pulled Chuck out of <br/>
school lol <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh yeah, GYM class.  I agree.  I remember grades for running were <br/>
based on speed... run the mile between x minutes and y minutes you <br/>
get an A, between y minutes and z minutes, a B.  And so on.  Very <br/>
little makes sense to me about this.  And the art.  I remember one <br/>
project in particular where my daughter had painted a picture in <br/>
such a way to give it a 3D metallic appearance... very impressive.  <br/>
She got an F because the teacher said that what she had painted was <br/>
unrealistic.  No metallic.  The same teacher even erased some of her <br/>
work in progress during the course of the year and made her do it <br/>
over differently.  My daughter is still hung up about the art I&#39;m <br/>
afraid.  She got lots of positive recognition in grade school - even <br/>
had some work sent overseas as representative of US grade school art <br/>
skill or some such stuff.  But middle then high school it turned <br/>
ugly.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your kind words... :)  I do hope she finds it again if <br/>
that&#39;s what she wants.<br/>
