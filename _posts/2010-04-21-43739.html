<div id="ygrps-yiv-1102455151">When my son was six he did something similar. I can&#39;t remember what he did but he came out with &quot;You really should spank me for that!&quot; We had never done anything of the sort!! Have no idea where it came from...except maybe something he saw in a video...he had been watching the OLD looney toons cartoons. There is a lot of hitting going on there. Maybe just a stage???<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1003848098">When Linnaea was 6 she had a really hard time. And it was hard on all of us, it was draining, it was awful. She would get so frustrated and so angry over things that I couldn&#39;t see. And I tried so hard to fix things, and we tiptoed around to try and make things better and nothing was better. I stopped trying to fix things and I stopped trying to get her to see how what she was doing was awful and hard on the rest of us. I stopped trying to redirect and to fix and to cure and to make it all better and instead began to just sit with her when things were bad. And I upped how much I was with her when things were good. I don&#39;t know that those things stopped what was going on, I don&#39;t have a case control to demonstrate anything, but it got much better. Time in was better, time in seems to fix so many things. <br/>
<br/>
It also helped to do things like draw on her, the contact, the tickling of a pen, those things calmed her down. Or to tell back stories or to offer something loving and generous in a moment when she felt unloveable. Maybe your son feels unloveable and wants to be treated accordingly. Maybe if you can demonstrate love he will begin to feel more loving in return. Maybe he won&#39;t, but maybe you&#39;ll see more of what is going on that makes him tense and angry enough to hit and call names. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1231542790">Thanks Schuyler :)<br/>
<br/>
Today he said something even stranger which got me thinking....  &#39;Id smack you if i had a hand!!!&#39; WHAT he has two hands -  it was really quite funny.  <br/>
<br/>
It was his birthday 2 weeks ago and he got a DVD which we had both watched together and i thought - hm best have a look at that....  We watched and sure enough, &#39;Id smack you if I had a hand&#39; was a line in it, and also later there was a scene where one of the robots was asking the other to smack him and thanked him when it was done and then it happened again so that is highly likely where it came from.  Its funny perhaps due to that scene maybe he thinks that smacking someone makes them feel good!?  You just dont know do you!  Isnt it so strange that he just seems to pick up those kind of things - the two girls never did at all 7 if I hadnt been listening for certain things I wouldnt have noticed either.  <br/>
<br/>
Im sure the hitting will continue at times, however perhaps it is the age as much as anything, and perhaps I do try and fix things when I often dont need too - that is my nature and its hard to not do it.  I shall take him out more and run around and go to the beach etc - even though its coming into winter the beach is still great, this may help him burn off some of his energy.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for your response.<br/>
<br/>

their 7 yos. If behavior comes out of no where, if there hasn&#39;t be a  <br/>
big change in his life, it&#39;s more than likely a stage of development.  <br/>
Could be your son&#39;s precocious to go through it at 6 instead of 7. :-)  <br/>
Some internal change has happened and the rug&#39;s been proverbially  <br/>
pulled out from beneath his understanding of how the world works. It  <br/>
will take a bit to get back to equilibrium. And what he needs is the  <br/>
comfort of your understanding as he goes through this.<br/>
<br/>
Do, of course, redirect the hitting. But if he has a funny streak,  <br/>
humor might help with the verbal stuff. If he tells you to shut up you  <br/>
can say &quot;No, you shut up&quot; in a light voice.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re prone to PMS and your husband gets stern with your moods to  <br/>
teach you how to behave better, does it help you? Try looking at it  <br/>
more that way and find ways to soften the environmnent for him.<br/>

<br/>
My first thought was that kids he&#39;s playing with are making comments to him.  <br/>
<br/>
It was around that age when Dylan&#39;s cousins found out we didn&#39;t spank Dylan.   They were intrigued  and skeptical. &lt;g&gt;    If he did anything they didn&#39;t like they&#39;d tell him that his mom and dad should spank him.   So, I&#39;d suspect a play group where he&#39;s hearing from other kids.   <br/>
<br/>
Is it possible he&#39;s having problems with some kid in a play group again?  Some kid who&#39;s not liking something your son is doing and is telling him he ought to get smacked?   Maybe find something better to do on play group days, go someplace different for awhile and see if anything changes.  Just a thought. <br/>
<br/>
Another thought is that if he&#39;s trying to control an impulse to hit he&#39;s considering the general morality of hitting.  Hitting someone who doesn&#39;t hit you is pretty bad.  Hitting someone who hits you is less bad, etc.    If he&#39;s feeling like he wants to hit someone, maybe pay attention to see if you can notice what might be frustrating him.  It&#39;s hard to be little.   Look for things that might be frustrating him and see if you can ease it some.  Play with him more.  <br/>
<br/>
My other thought is that he&#39;s being funny.   We don&#39;t hit, we never hit Dylan, we never hit each other, we don&#39;t smack our friends, but we joke about doing bodily harm. <br/>
<br/>
I think Joyce had a good idea of bringing humor to the situation.   Next time he says you should smack him you could say something like, &quot;Well if we were a hitting family, I wouldn&#39;t just smack you, I&#39;d slap you out from between your ears.&quot;  (Johnny Eager)  Or something similar and silly and exaggerated.   <br/>
<br/>
And if he is enjoying to possibility of physical humor there&#39;s The Three Stooges with lots of smacking, slapping, tweaking, etc.   <br/>

When Morgan wants to understand what something means, she often doesn&#39;t ask. Instead, she tries the words or behavior out in a bunch of different situations until she &quot;gets it&quot;. She tends to do it most often with weird kinds of referential humor - Ed, Edd and Eddy is good for that. When I notice her doing something like that I&#39;ll ask if she understands what it means and try to explain if she wants me to. Sometimes the explanation is longer than she has the patience to hear - she&#39;s not a fan of &quot;too many words&quot; so I try to keep things short. That&#39;s hard with referential humor!<br/>

I wondered this, too. The different ways children explore morality is really fascinating. I was surprised just how much of Mo&#39;s &quot;bad behavior&quot; when she was younger seemed to be an exploration of big, difficult human concepts like the relative morality of violence. <br/>

<br/>
Ed, Edd and Eddy have a lot of physical humor, if he prefers cartoons, and of course all the &quot;classics&quot; - Loony Tunes and Hannah Barbara cartoons and others of that era. Mo looooooves physical comedy, and although I&#39;m not a fan, myself, I&#39;ve done quite a bit of reading on the subject so that I can see what&#39;s so interesting about it (still don&#39;t find it funny, but interesting, yes, especially from a technical perspective).<br/>
<br/>
Something else to look into if he&#39;s exploring the idea of &quot;trash talk&quot; is the Pokemon shows and movies. <br/>
