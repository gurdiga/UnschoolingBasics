<div id="ygrps-yiv-1371918981">Hi Ren, I&#39;m not sure if you missed this one - might have been lost in the shuffle, and I would love a response, thanks :o)<br/>
<br/>
    I remember in a post not that long ago you mentioned that you had some issues with emotional/verbal abuse early in your marriage, but not now.  Would you be able to share what made the difference?  What changed?<br/>
   <br/>
  I picked up the book &quot;The Verbally Abusive Relationship&quot; at the library after it was suggested by someone in this group, and it&#39;s rather discouraging how much of it fits for Ryan and I right now.  Especially since we have put rules to rest in our home, I have noticed Ryan getting triggered even more by all that is out of his control, and often it&#39;s me that takes the brunt of it.<br/>
   <br/>
  I would be happy for you to email me offlist if that&#39;s what you&#39;re comfortable with, or onlist if it could possibly help anyone else.  I don&#39;t have an issue at all with airing this in front of the group, since I would suspect that there is the odd other couple out there who has had a rocky time &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
   <br/>
  Thanks,<br/>
  Jodi <br/>

issues with emotional/verbal abuse early in your marriage, but not<br/>

<br/>
Ours were more about control issues...which are directly linked to<br/>
emotional abuse in a sense. He did do some stomping around and being<br/>
generally grumpy and making everyone uncomfortable too.<br/>
What changed?<br/>
Wow...that&#39;s a story that spans years and a separation and counseling.<br/>
Mostly, I put my foot down and told him that certain things were not<br/>
acceptable. Ever. I was willing to be a partner if he was willing to<br/>
really examine issues and work harder to be not only respectful but<br/>
democratic. He&#39;s really a pretty laid back guy over all, but he picked<br/>
up some not-so-helpful behaviors from both societal messages and his<br/>
raising.<br/>
<br/>
It seems like layer upon layer we both extract and refine this stuff.<br/>
It doesn&#39;t magically go away, but it got better and better over the<br/>
years. Some things were better because I was unwilling to live with<br/>
it. A lot of it got better because he really cares very deeply about<br/>
doing better.<br/>
<br/>
Our latest intense discussion revolved around my pointing out his<br/>
ability to disconnect at times and leave a lot of traditional &quot;female&quot;<br/>
roles to me. I was the stay-at-home parent for most of our marriage<br/>
but I&#39;m not anymore and yet a lot of the caretaking roles were still<br/>
being left to me. We had a great discussion about how his Dad was<br/>
loving and a good provider, but hugely uninvolved and the messages he<br/>
picked up from that raising.<br/>
<br/>
He realizes that his natural inclination is to disconnect over certain<br/>
things. He&#39;s been extra available and connected since that<br/>
discussion....even taking the kids to their dentist appointments last<br/>
week, something I would normally have handled.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I think it takes someone who is willing to change and sees<br/>
where they can do better if they are being controlling and/or<br/>
disrespectful (I had a lot to learn about that too). I think it takes<br/>
a certain ability from the other partner to not allow themselves to be<br/>
walked on or treated poorly. A big dose of forgiveness and space is<br/>
helpful too. :)<br/>
