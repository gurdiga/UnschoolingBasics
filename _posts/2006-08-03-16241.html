and joyful life through unschooling :)<br/>
<br/>
I need advice on how I should have better responded to a situation that<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; occurred today.  We frequent the library quite often, one of several<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How old are your kids?  Are they old enough that you could easily leave them<br/>
momentarily to take another to the bathroom?  I miss &quot;my library&quot; in a city<br/>
I used to live in.  There was a set of bathrooms right in the children&#39;s<br/>
area.  Whoever planned the children&#39;s area (with their low shelves, small<br/>
computer desks, plenty of room, lounging pillows and ledges and a bathroom<br/>
right there) is a genius!  Do you go at times where your kids either are<br/>
interacting with other kids or are the only ones there?<br/>
<br/>
Today, my 2 1/2 year old dd was making a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; noise, over and over again which seemed to reverberate louder and louder<br/>
&gt; in the room (because she likes the echo) and my 5 year old dd (who loves<br/>

&gt; &quot;stop it&quot; over and over and louder and louder to where she inevitably<br/>
&gt; begins to cry.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Could you have physically separated them?  One key is that I would look for<br/>
ways to circumvent this kind of situation from happening.  What is it that<br/>
triggers this scenario and how can you work to keep that from happening?<br/>
Could you wonder the stacks with your younger child or engage her in a book<br/>
or puzzle or other activity?  Could you possibly take your older chldren to<br/>
the library at a time when you can leave the younger ones at home?  I know<br/>
that before we got our beautiful aforementioned library, that library day<br/>
was a huge boredom day for Keon.  He had no interest in lounging at the<br/>
library and reading books.  He would go in, grab a Donald Crews book (we<br/>
read them all - several times) and was ready to leave.  Not what the girls<br/>
wanted to do.  They wanted to spend time browsing, reading, talking to the<br/>
librarians, playing on the computers, etc.  So I got to a point where I<br/>
would take them after their dad got home or on the weekends &quot;the guys&quot; would<br/>
head to the model train store and we would head to the library.<br/>
<br/>
Think NOW about ways that you could better have handled the situation.  How<br/>
you could have prevented the situation to begin with.  It also might help to<br/>
explain to your 5yo that she doesn&#39;t need to parent your toddler and that<br/>
you can do that, but for her to tell you when her sister is bothering her<br/>
and ask for your help in giving her the peaceful surroundings that she is<br/>
desiring.<br/>

Asking questions doesn&#39;t bother us at all. It&#39;s arguing that there&#39;s no <br/>
way our advice will ever work that pisses me off.<br/>
<br/>
And none of us are &quot;pros&quot;---just maybe more experienced and passionate <br/>
about unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re waiting until the situation is at a &quot;ten&quot; before you respond. <br/>
Cut it off at the pass! Stop the behavior at the &quot;one&quot;---if you know <br/>
what&#39;s going to happen, on the *way* to the bathroom remind the five <br/>
year old that *you* are the mom and don&#39;t need her input with the <br/>
toddler. Remind the toddler that the library is a quiet place. OR, if <br/>
the bathroom is empty---you can ALL sing a song and listen to the <br/>
echoes.<br/>
<br/>
But things shouldn&#39;t get to the point of the out of control geyser. <br/>
Stop it waaaay before that. Redirect. Give them gum just before going <br/>
in (chewing mouths have a harder time making noise), sing a song, ask <br/>
the five year old how many tiles she can count, keep them busy! Waiting <br/>
until things are already out of control won&#39;t do anything but make <br/>
things worse. Avoid that point.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Real questions are ALWAYS okay - it&#39;s the faked hypothetical &quot;just <br/>
trying to stir up trouble&quot; ones that get folks miffed.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I need advice on how I should have better responded to a situation <br/>

&gt;at, <br/>

 </span></blockquote>As was mentioned, is there a bathroom handy that a child can get to <br/>
on his/her own? Our library, too, has a nice roomy &quot;family style&quot; <br/>
bathroom right in the children&#39;s room (the children&#39;s section is the <br/>
whole downstairs - the library itself is an old historic home that <br/>
was expanded onto, the children&#39;s section would have been the <br/>
basement. What&#39;s cool is that the old &#39;sitting room&#39; area, bay <br/>
windows, fireplace, and all is where they have the mystery <br/>
collection, you can sit in the &quot;parlor&quot; and read mysteries set <br/>
in &quot;the parlor&quot;...) In this kind of set up, a 5 yr old (or older) <br/>
could readily manage the situation on her own. Also, maybe avoid the <br/>
whole situation by limiting the library visiting time for now - make <br/>
sure everyone gets fed and &quot;watered&quot; far enough in advance that you <br/>
can make a potty break before leaving the house, then only stay an <br/>
hour or so (however long it is on average before they&#39;d need to go <br/>
again) and do a family potty break on the way out before leaving the <br/>
library for the trip home. That way, it isn&#39;t breaking into the <br/>
middle of whatever they are doing - that has already been wound down.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Today, my 2 1/2 year old dd was making a <br/>
&gt; noise, over and over again which seemed to reverberate louder and <br/>
&gt;louder <br/>
&gt; in the room (because she likes the echo) <br/>
 </span></blockquote>That would definitely signal me to get right there with her and say <br/>
something like &quot;Wow the echoes are really cool. Know what? I think <br/>
we should find someplace where we can really check out lots of <br/>
echoes...I know a spot (at some other okay to make noise place, at <br/>
home, wherever) that would be really good. Let&#39;s give (big sister) a <br/>
couple minutes to finish up with (whatever) and we can go there. For <br/>
the next couple minutes though, let&#39;s try to cut down the echoes. <br/>
Folks in libraries generally want it a little quiet while they are <br/>
thinking and reading.&quot; (BTW at our library, because the children&#39;s <br/>
section is totally separate from the adult section, the volume tends <br/>
to be a little more normal speaking voice rather than hushed. They <br/>
even have toys that ring bells and make other noises there. Yelling <br/>
is out but talking is okay).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;and my 5 year old dd (who loves <br/>
&gt; to play the part of a parent correcting the younger one) was <br/>
&gt;saying <br/>
&gt; &quot;stop it&quot; over and over and louder and louder to where she <br/>
&gt;inevitably <br/>
&gt; begins to cry.  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a not in the moment thing. Separate and apart from the <br/>
event, maybe talk with her about this type of situation. I&#39;m <br/>
guessing that she has heard &quot;you&#39;re a good helper with little <br/>
sis&quot; &quot;can you help Mommy with ... to take care of little sis&quot; and so <br/>
on. Makes sense, then, that she is going to &quot;take care&quot; of things if <br/>
it seems that it is needed. So, maybe talk with her (outside of the <br/>
situation) about how when you&#39;re at places like the library, you&#39;ll <br/>
take care of little sis so she can go do whatever it is she wants to <br/>
do. She doesn&#39;t have to feel responsible to manage her sibling(s). <br/>
In the moment, I might get right next to her, look in her face and <br/>
say &quot;Thanks, I&#39;ll take care of it. Why don&#39;t you go look at the fish <br/>
tank...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  How do you take the time, breath, and ask yourself <br/>
&gt; how to respond to this when the behavior at the moment is like an <br/>
&gt;out of <br/>
&gt; control geyser?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>First, nip it in the bud (I know, that phrase gets so abused, but it <br/>
fits). Rather than wait for the volume to escalate to the point they <br/>
can&#39;t hear, catch it quickly. Next, ignore &quot;everybody&quot; as <br/>
in &quot;everybody is watching me&quot; and focus on your kids and their <br/>
needs/situation. Third, figure out ahead of time how you&#39;ll handle <br/>
it. It&#39;s kind of similar to the way they teach defensive driving - <br/>
you don&#39;t wait until your car is in a skid or blows a tire or <br/>
whatever to figure out what to do. You mentally rehearse it ahead of <br/>
time so that when it does happen, you don&#39;t have to &quot;think it <br/>
through&quot; right then, you can just respond. Fourth, having 4 kids <br/>
with at different developmental stages and with different levels of <br/>
interest in library things and differing abilities to handle that <br/>
environment for long stretches, it might behoove you to indeed make <br/>
separate library days for different kids. Maybe children 1 & 3 <br/>
really love the computers there and could spend a long time, while <br/>
children 2 & 4 can handle maybe half an hour of browsing and picking <br/>
books and that&#39;s it. Trying to manage the two sets all at once means <br/>
that no one (especially you) ends up happy - two get their time cut <br/>
short OR two have to linger when they want to leave.<br/>

This is excellent advice, and not just in this situation either. I try <br/>
and follow this for myself and my own piece of mind. I have found that <br/>
it&#39;s easier to watch and take care of my own stress level when it&#39;s low <br/>
than when it&#39;s already at the point of no return. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-433001339">We have a great library and the potty is right in the children&#39;s area.  <br/>
I don&#39;t mind if my 7 year old hangs out at the computer or what not (but <br/>
he actually wanted to come with us this particular time) and I need to <br/>
take the 2 year old in because I&#39;m not leaving her out alone and when my <br/>
5 year old has to go...she has encopresis which is a big issue in <br/>
itself...our bathroom trips are involved and it&#39;s something that <br/>
requires me to attend to her quite often on some days. <br/>
<br/>
All my children get along great at the library together so I don&#39;t think <br/>
splitting up the time would be necessary.  My 2 year old LOVES the <br/>
library and could sit looking at books for hours on end.  It&#39;s dealing <br/>
with my daughter&#39;s potty issues that affect us all but that&#39;s another post.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for advice and suggestions.  I do a lot of prepping before <br/>
situations where I know something might arise but in this case it just <br/>
happened so quickly and my patience with changing my daughters undies <br/>
for the 10th time that day was wearing on me.  I didn&#39;t handle it well.<br/>
