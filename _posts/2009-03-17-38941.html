<div id="ygrps-yiv-344779849">Well, it&#39;s official, I will be speaking at the Great Big Happy Life <br/>
Conference next month. After lots of back and forth over the past <br/>
several months, I finally figured a way to work it out with the farm and <br/>
all, but I&#39;ll only be up there for Wednesday night, not the entire <br/>
conference.<br/>
<br/>
Meredith Novak will also be speaking, and I know how many of you enjoy <br/>
her posts here and at AlwaysUnschooled. Cameron Lovejoy, too, will be <br/>
talking as a grown unschooler, which should be really inspiring. It <br/>
looks to be a great line up, especially that Gatto guy. ;)<br/>
