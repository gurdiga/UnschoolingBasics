<div id="ygrps-yiv-684337227">Merry Meet,<br/>
<br/>
 Here in my home we are learning. Our resent lession has been in how <br/>
to NOT punish when that is the action we would normally had taken. <br/>
<br/>
 I tried to talk to hubby about this, but with all his working, it <br/>
must have slipped his mind. One night, it all came to a head. Let me <br/>
explain. <br/>
<br/>
 We are driving home, almost there. Hubby stops at our mail box a <br/>
few blocks from home. Leaves the car running, gets out to get the <br/>
mail. Crystal jumps out of her seat and runs to the fron the van to <br/>
sit in his seat. Car still running. As always it seems, she pays no <br/>
attention when getting to the seat and steps on the eggs we just got <br/>
from the store along with other things. I try to keep my cool. I let <br/>
her know what she did and that it was not a good thing. But before I <br/>
could finish talking to her, hubby is on his way back to the his <br/>
seat and sees Crystal and start with his command voice to tell her <br/>
she is wrong and to get out of his seat, and that he has warned her <br/>
before and yadda yadda yadda. She freaks, steps on things again as <br/>
she scrables back to her seat to buckle up. He gets in notices she <br/>
stepped in things, and keeps on his lecture, she is crying now and <br/>
upset and will not stop to listen, so he gets more upset. I try to <br/>
talk to her, to get her to calm down, and hubby keeps interupting in <br/>
that voice of his that promotes nothing with our little one. Finally <br/>
I have had enough, and I yell at him to be quite that he is not <br/>
helping. And I do mean I yell. At this point, they both shut up. And <br/>
I explain to hubby that we no longer treat her that way and there is <br/>
a better way. He tried to argue with me, but I keep on him about it, <br/>
trying to get him to listen. It is heated for a few moments as we <br/>
drive home. I feel badly that Crystal is viewing us not agreeing but <br/>
it just has to be done. We pull into the drive way and I talk to <br/>
Crystal as he grumbles. I explain what she did, how she broke yummy <br/>
food and we could not go buy more right now, and how that makes <br/>
Daddy upset. I let them BOTH know, getting in his seat was not a <br/>
biggie, I was right there. He agrees with that now that he has <br/>
settled down. I then tell Crystal she is not in trouble as her Daddy <br/>
said she was but that she needs to try and make it better. I ask her <br/>
for ideas. This is new to her so she has no clue. I give her some <br/>
ideas, like helping Daddy bring in the bags or helping us put the <br/>
food away, or maybe making him a picture of her not stepping on the <br/>
eggs. She fights this new change a little but in the end says ok. <br/>
She brings some bags in, drops them in front of the door, and I <br/>
trip. Her Daddy is not happy &quot;She knows better&quot; but he grumbles to <br/>
himself. She then goes to make a picture. What she comes back with <br/>
makes everything ok again, and then some. <br/>
<br/>
 She brings her daddy a picture that stuns him. She traced her foot <br/>
on the paper, and then drew eggs far away from her foot print. We <br/>
both almost fell over laughing. He let her know that the idea was <br/>
for her to not step on things anymore, and she did step on the paper <br/>
to trace it, but that it was not hurting the paper so that was ok. <br/>
Always the soldier that one. LOL  We really expected some kind of <br/>
stick figure, maybe the van, and some food. No idea she would see it <br/>
like that. <br/>
<br/>
 So in short, we are now on a new path, of trying to fix things <br/>
rather then punish. For punishing teaches her things that we do not <br/>
wish her to learn (How to get away with things, thinking that we are <br/>
against her) <br/>
 <br/>
 I share all this with all of you because it is thanks to those open <br/>
minded that we feel we can do this, as we have no other support. <br/>
 Thank You!<br/>
<br/>
 Blessings,<br/>

Hi Kimberly,<br/>
{{{{{hugs}}}}}<br/>
<br/>
It seems like you are trying so hard, and have lots of challenges. Just<br/>
trying to see the path is hard when one person in your relationship is<br/>
looking in another direction, let alone move along it.<br/>
<br/>
Just to push you a little further....<br/>
<br/>
Why did you feel she had to &quot;try and make it better&quot;? I think it is very<br/>
dangerous to make children feel that they are responsible for an adults<br/>
feelings - indeed that anyone is actually responsible for some one else&#39;s<br/>
feelings. Be careful that she does not start to believe that she has to keep<br/>
Daddy happy at the expense of her own selfhood. <br/>
<br/>
Everyone has accidents and drops stuff, and I would consider stepping on the<br/>
groceries in the realm of an accidental action. If you had dropped the eggs<br/>
while putting them away, would you have had to give dh some gift to make it<br/>
up? If he had done so, would he have made it up to Crystal and you? I&#39;m<br/>
guessing not, other than to just say something like &quot;shucks, sorry honey&quot;.<br/>
BTW I always put the groceries in the trunk - Jayn has a tendency just to<br/>
step on whatever is in her way also.<br/>
<br/>
Have you done much reading on the concept of &quot;Principles instead of Rules&quot;?<br/>
The idea is that the Principles that we live by apply to all members of the<br/>
family, and each member lives up to them as much as they are developmentally<br/>
able. One of the principles we have is &quot;Safety First&quot;. In recovery Spiritual<br/>
Principles are expressed as single words or short phrases, the opposite of<br/>
Character Defects. Examples are Kindness, Honesty, Thoughtfulness of others,<br/>
Joyfulness. Other people have other ways of expressing them. These are the<br/>
blueprint or map of the path that is the alternative to punishing and<br/>
shaming. <br/>
<br/>
Your dh would get so much out of Ben Lovejoy&#39;s conference workshop on this<br/>
issue. Also Ben is a former military man, so if anyone could empathize with<br/>
his journey it would be Ben. Gosh I wish you could swing being there!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1462659582">Kimberly,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing this!  We too are in a transition in parenting as <br/>
dh learns a new way of doing things.  ;)  I have had to handle things <br/>
the same way with him when he slipped into old ways of parenting and <br/>
totally blows what we have been working so hard on.  This actually <br/>
happens often, because dh is a creature of habit (and was an only <br/>
child with a disfunctional mother).  Sometimes it is like we are <br/>
parenting kids and husbands.  lol!!!<br/>
<br/>
I love the way you handled this with your dd.  She had to have <br/>
learned more from it than from a scolding, or anything else, because <br/>
it made her think about what she did so SHE can correct the behavior.<br/>
<br/>
This story brings to mind the idea of a parent that punishes a child <br/>
for doing something that was also a mistake of the parent. <br/>
Let me explain:  If dh had gotten angry for a child jumping out of <br/>
their seat into the driver&#39;s seat of the &quot;running&quot; van and something <br/>
bad happened (or not) because of this action -though the child <br/>
shouldn&#39;t have moved from their seat -dh would have been equally <br/>
guilty for the happening, because HE was the one that left the van <br/>
running in the first place.  Does that make sense?  Kids will be <br/>
kids, and I think it is our place to think one step ahead (the what <br/>
ifs) and make sure things are safe.  Like turning off the van when <br/>
you get out (and even take the keys with you!).   I actually do this <br/>
type of &quot;thinking ahead&quot; all the time and it saves me sooo many <br/>
headaches.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1570709294">Dear Robyn,<br/>
<br/>
 You could be very right about this. I was not trying to show her <br/>
that she is responcible for how others feel but rather that when she <br/>
does something &quot;wrong&quot; that she needs to try and make it better. <br/>
Your 100% right though, for most adults, if they had dropped the <br/>
eggs they would have done little more then say sorry. But we Hubby <br/>
and I try to be a little more mindful then that and so we might have <br/>
done something more, like make dinner, do the dishes, wash the <br/>
floor. Something to remind us to be more mindful, and to shop others <br/>
around us that we care to do better. To some extent I feel like she <br/>
needs to feel responcible for how she makes others feel in life. But <br/>
that line is a thin one, for we can not control how others feel. <br/>
Maybe something best left for her to see latter. I think I shall <br/>
still strive to show her that she does have the power to fix things <br/>
when they are wrong and that she should try. Far too few people have <br/>
little regard for others, maybe we are selfish creatures my nature, <br/>
but I will not raise her to the kind of person who throws trash on <br/>
the ground, playing music at a valume that disturbs other, or uses <br/>
language that shows no respect for others or herself. I could be <br/>
wrong. <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Why did you feel she had to &quot;try and make it better&quot;? &gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We have looked at every possible way to get there it just not seem <br/>
possible this year and that is very sad as my mother leaves 2 hours <br/>
away from the  conference and we couls stay with her. But alas, that <br/>
is 1000 miles away from here and our situation is not looking out. <br/>
Our roomate is not holding up her side of the deal and has been here <br/>
for 5 months. Now she is medically ill, spent a week in the <br/>
hospital, and is on bed rest for the next week. Though she seems to <br/>
be spending most it at her friends house on the couch she says. <br/>
  -sigh-  I wish we could make it. I know it would help so very <br/>
much. Next years is going to be where? <br/>

Well this was part of what I was getting at - the imposed consequence of<br/>
making a drawing seemed really arbitrary, and a good way to discourage<br/>
drawing for pleasure.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s just a little girl - they aren&#39;t always as in control of their bodies<br/>
to watch where they step. Your dh was the one who evidently lost his temper<br/>
and made her afraid. She now might think that eggs and illustrations are<br/>
more important to him than she is. Every time he is angry at her for being a<br/>
normal 4yo, it&#39;s like a little chip away of the stone block that is her<br/>
selfhood.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m guessing you meant &quot;show others&quot; here. Sometimes typos make funnies.<br/>
<br/>
Holy cow, it&#39;s just a few eggs!<br/>
<br/>
Accidents happen, no matter how mindful you are. If there is a huge price to<br/>
be paid every time, you will raise a girl who is scared all the time of<br/>
having some little accident. It is not about &quot;doing better&quot; than a child may<br/>
be capable of. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;she does have the power to fix things <br/>
when they are wrong and that she should try. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
All the king&#39;s horses and all the king&#39;s men....<br/>
<br/>
What I am saying is that a drawing does not fix the eggs.<br/>
<br/>
Trying to fix Daddy&#39;s perfectly unreasonable anger is definitely not her job<br/>
- if you try to make it her job, or yours, the results may be sadness, pain<br/>
and less trust. Even you disagreed with his reaction - you told us so.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to make things a lesson, even a &quot;life-lesson&quot;, for learning<br/>
to occur.<br/>
<br/>

language that shows no respect for others or herself. I could be <br/>
wrong.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It is a particular philosophy that children are born selfish, malicious and<br/>
evil, and that constant vigilance and training is needed to root out that<br/>
&quot;sinful nature&quot;. This belief may make it harder for anyone to Unschool<br/>
joyfully. I see the opposite in Jayn, even if she is thoughtless at times,<br/>
being only 4.5. That doesn&#39;t mean that I don&#39;t sometimes worry about how she<br/>
is being perceived by others, or wince when she says something that is less<br/>
kind. But I see it as definitely something she will do less and less of as<br/>
she continues to be treated with respect and understanding, and gains more<br/>
interpersonal relationship tools. I see those issues as *my* baggage, not<br/>
her character defects.<br/>
<br/>
Are these the defining characteristics of horrible people to you? I think<br/>
there are lots worse things than these going on behind the eyes and closed<br/>
doors of perfectly respectable seeming people. It just seems really unlikely<br/>
that if you treat her with kindness and respect, and genuine understanding<br/>
for the age-related limitations of her abilities, that she will grow up so<br/>
totally the opposite of everything you model for her. <br/>
<br/>
What if she goes a bit deaf and plays her music louder than you would like?<br/>
Does that make your whole parenting life a failure? I&#39;m using an extreme<br/>
illustration to suggest that being negatively predictive, especially when<br/>
your daughter is so little, is less useful, than looking for wonder and joy<br/>
in the immediate present for moving to unschooling, which by its very nature<br/>
is unpredictable. People who have been doing it a long time can predict<br/>
reasonably accurately that children live up to (and go beyond) how well they<br/>
are treated.<br/>

***** On Laurie&#39;s second birthday, my mom gave her the ugliest dress <br/>
I&#39;d ever seen. It was Mom&#39;s idea of &quot;how a little girl SHOULD <br/>
dress.&quot; Laurie happened to like her cowboy boots, jeans and t-<br/>
shirts. Laurie opened the dress and said, &quot;Eeeewwww that&#39;s so ugly,&quot; <br/>
and I inwardly cringed. Mom got upset, glared at Laurie and stomped <br/>
out of the room and said that Laurie was an inconsiderate and <br/>
ungrateful spoiled child. Laurie was hurt by Mom&#39;s words and mean <br/>
look. <br/>
<br/>
She had no clue that she had hurt Mom&#39;s feelings and I didn&#39;t feel <br/>
it was a 2-year old&#39;s place to heal the wounds of a grown woman. All <br/>
Laurie understood was that her grandmother had made an ugly face at <br/>
her and called her names. If I had demanded that Laurie apologize, <br/>
imo I would have been placing my mother&#39;s feelings above Laurie&#39;s. I <br/>
consoled Laurie and later told Mom thank you for the dress but that <br/>
giving Laurie a gift in order to change who she was didn&#39;t seem like <br/>
a gift at all. 22 years later Mom STILL gets upset when she thinks <br/>
of that day. She saw/sees nothing wrong with her attitude towards <br/>
Laurie. <br/>
<br/>
Laurie cringes when she thinks of what she said when she saw that <br/>
dress, but we both agree it was hideous. As she got older, of course <br/>
she learned tact and diplomacy and fakes a smile and says &quot;thank <br/>
you&quot; when Mom gives her gifts that go straight to Goodwill. <br/>
<br/>
As parents, we have to put our children first. They need us to take <br/>
up for them. They need us to empathize with them. I doubt that my <br/>
mother&#39;s attitude will ever change. My parenting horrified her. <br/>
Laurie horrifies her. My book horrified her. I&#39;d still be kicking my <br/>
own butt if I had fussed at Laurie that day for saying what I was <br/>
thinking just to attempt to console a woman who is inconsolable.<br/>

Well, I, for one, think your parenting was admirable, your daughter is  <br/>
*virtually* delightful, and your book thoroughly enjoyable!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1639580957">&quot;It is a particular philosophy that children are born selfish, <br/>
malicious and<br/>
evil, and that constant vigilance and training is needed to root out <br/>
that<br/>
&quot;sinful nature&quot;.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Your right, some people believe all of that, but I do NOT believe <br/>
in sin, or that a child can be malicious. But I do believe that <br/>
Humans are animals with tools and that like animals we are born <br/>
selfish and caring only about ourselves, not animals that are like <br/>
to live in large groups unlike the insect ants and such. I think <br/>
that kindness and such are things kids learn. I do think though that <br/>
they learn best by example and a lession may not be the best way. <br/>
<br/>
 Do not asume that because I think humans are a selfish animal by <br/>
nature that I think they are born evil for I do not believe in evil, <br/>
for it is not natural. <br/>
<br/>
 Let me know why you think people are not born selfish because from <br/>
what I remeber of my Psyc classes, this is what many experts think <br/>
as well. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1323990847">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Let me know why you think people are not born selfish because from <br/>
what I remeber of my Psyc classes, this is what many experts think <br/>
as well.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
First of all I care just about zip what experts teaching Psyc classes, in an<br/>
out of context to Unschooling manner, think or express in their classes,<br/>
which are not about Unschooling. If you want to spend some time researching<br/>
Unschooling, you could look at &quot;The Unprocessed Child&quot; by Valerie<br/>
Fitzenreiter for an astonishing story about ignorance and bias in an<br/>
&quot;expert&quot; teaching university level courses about child rearing, in a book<br/>
that *is* about Unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
For what it is worth, I think humans and animals are born with an instinct<br/>
for self-preservation, and the fastest way to move beyond it is love, love,<br/>
love the people in your life. It is sometimes this instinct that causes<br/>
children to behave in odd ways. I also think one of the fundamental<br/>
instincts that humans have is to form communities for common good, the most<br/>
immediate one being their family. <br/>
<br/>
Below are some definitions that a cursory Google search put out. I cut and<br/>
pasted. There may be others too.<br/>
<br/>
Believing this kind of thing about a child might make it more difficult to<br/>
Unschool with joy. We *can* choose our beliefs. Choosing to believe that our<br/>
children are fundamentally loving, caring and want to make us proud and<br/>
happy, might make it easier to Unschool with them.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think people are both selfish and social creatures.<br/>
<br/>
I think we&#39;re full of conflicting signals because we&#39;ve evolved from<br/>
creatures that had different needs. And not just conflicts between been<br/>
independent and social, but all sorts of conflicts.<br/>
<br/>
We evolved from creatures that lived alone so it made sense to put self<br/>
first. For instance, it isn&#39;t wrong for a tiger to drive another tiger out<br/>
of its territory. It&#39;s what makes sense for survival. That&#39;s just what<br/>
creatures that live independently need to do.<br/>
<br/>
But when we became creatures that survived better by working together, we<br/>
didn&#39;t lose those drives that tells us thinking of ourselves is good for<br/>
survival. We just added another layer on top that told us it makes sense to<br/>
cooperate and be drawn to forming groups and doing what&#39;s necessary to keep<br/>
the group working together.<br/>
<br/>
So we&#39;ve naturally got two right but conflicting signals in our heads: Think<br/>
of self, think of the group.<br/>
<br/>
Modeling helps kids figure out which thoughts will work best for what they<br/>
want.<br/>
