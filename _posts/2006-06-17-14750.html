<div id="ygrps-yiv-108238700">Just picked this up from another list (Elissa?):<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I am an interning reporter for National Public Radio, and am composing<br/>
a story on the unschooling movement. I would like to talk to and<br/>
potentially interview an unschooling family in the immediate DC area.<br/>
Would you be willing to pass this request along to the members of<br/>
your listserv, in case any of them might be interested?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
