been trying to give unschooling a chance so we can both learn more <br/>

So I decided to have bed time earlier, 7:30pm, for the past 2 days. <br/>
They are waking at 8am. It takes them about a half hour to be up. <br/>

Then to eat and get dressed, takes an hour. so by time they are <br/>
done, it will be 10:30. my kids ages are 10,3,1. the 3 and 1 year <br/>

I have to start cooking by 3pm.I work in the evenings when my <br/>

The little time we get between 10:30-12 is spent fussing over who <br/>
needs my attention. Because the 10 year old wants to have more of my <br/>
attention than the smaller children.<br/>
  <br/>
Also if I don&#39;t think of something to do between those times, the 10 <br/>
year old either wants to watch TV or paint or play games on the <br/>

You said you were wanting to unschool?  There is often very little in unschooling that looks like schoolwork.  The kids play, paint, do computer stuff, explore, etc.<br/>
<br/>
May I suggest reading some books by John Holt and reading some of the essays at www.unschooling.com<br/>

<br/>
Homeschooling is different than unschooling.  Unschooling is just what it<br/>
sounds like.  Not schooling.  So, what will happen in your unschooling<br/>
life with your children will probably never look like &quot;school work.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You can read more about unschooling at www.sandradodd.com.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re worried about not being able to make time in the day for &quot;school<br/>
work.&quot;  I hope you can find time to read more about unschooling.  Not<br/>
only to see if it&#39;s right for you but to gain some better understanding<br/>
about how living with your children as happily as possible can be the<br/>
foundation for all the learning they will naturally do their whole lives<br/>
long. <br/>
<br/>
If you really decide unschooling is the right thing for your family your<br/>
focus can (and will) shift from trying to make time for school work, to<br/>
valuing every moment you spend happily with your kids. <br/>
<br/>
***The little time we get between 10:30-12 is spent fussing over who <br/>
needs my attention. Because the 10 year old wants to have more of my <br/>
attention than the smaller children.***<br/>
<br/>
This sounds not so much like a sleep time issue as it does a &quot;quality<br/>
time with mom&quot; issue.  If the choice you&#39;re making to direct their sleep<br/>
and have them waking at a certain time is creating a stressful morning<br/>
for you all, you won&#39;t have the quality of time shared that you otherwise<br/>
might.   I understand your desire to have more time with them before you<br/>
have to go to work.  But maybe instead of focusing on the amount of<br/>
hours, focus on the quality of the hours.  A shorter, happy interaction<br/>
with you is worth more than a longer stressful one.  <br/>
<br/>
My son started sleeping later at about that age.  He now stays up until<br/>
two or three some mornings and sleeps until anywhere between ten and<br/>
noon.  I think, in part, a body that age is beginning it&#39;s transition to<br/>
teen hood and I believe teens require more sleep time.  However, even in<br/>
young children sleep requirements can change often and drastically.  Your<br/>
ten year old is really the only one who can decide how much sleep he or<br/>
she needs. <br/>
<br/>
***Also if I don&#39;t think of something to do between those times, the 10 <br/>
year old either wants to watch TV or paint or play games on the <br/>
computer.***<br/>
<br/>
I think those are good, creative solutions.  All of those choices are<br/>
&quot;something to do&quot;.  All of those things are valuable.  You can show<br/>
interest in what your ten year old is watching, painting or playing.  You<br/>
can listen to his or her ideas and excitement about what&#39;s going on, you<br/>
can share in the fun and you will be doing something together.<br/>
<br/>
***I have to start cooking by 3pm.I work in the evenings when my <br/>
husband comes home so I want to do things with them in the mornings.***<br/>
<br/>
Can your husband share the cooking?  Can he cook a few days and you cook<br/>
the other days?  <br/>
Can you cook on weekends and put food in the freezer that can then be<br/>
yanked out and heated in the microwave?<br/>
Can you choose two or three days a week where you eat commercially<br/>
prepared stuff that won&#39;t require a lot of your time? <br/>
Send out for Pizza?  Have your husband grab some take out on his way<br/>
home?<br/>
<br/>
Seeing more than one option could open up two or three or more days a<br/>
week for you to spend more quality time with your kids. <br/>
<br/>
You could have music playing and you could all be dancing while you cook,<br/>
or a movie on that you can all watch and talk about, or you could invent<br/>
some silly game to play while you&#39;re cooking and your kids are nearby so<br/>
that you *will* be spending time with them even though you&#39;re doing the<br/>
other things you want to do. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>And children love to be engaged in the kitchen!!  My kids have been <br/>
helping in the kitchen since the could stand on a chair and slice <br/>
olives with an egg slicer!  Not that I force them, it&#39;s more of a <br/>
case of them wanting to be in there with me.  I have tons of tools <br/>
(mostly Pampered  Chef) that my kids all know how to use.  Food <br/>
choppers, cheese graters (like the kind that Olive  Garden used to <br/>
use to grate parmesan cheese), egg slicers, measuring cups, <br/>
measuring spoons, bamboo spoons for stirring, real knives and <br/>
cutting boards, rolling pins, flour sugar shakers, etc.  My kids are <br/>
*constantly* wanting to cook or help cook.  The agreement in today&#39;s <br/>
household is that if they help me clear the work counter they can <br/>
make cookies.  There is *always* a project of some sort to do!  The <br/>
like helping with dinner, lunches and breakfasts.  I&#39;ve taught my <br/>
kids to do many things on their own so they are more self-<br/>
sufficient.  They know how to make ramen in the microwave and the <br/>
older two can make mashed potatoes and scrambled eggs and mac-n-<br/>
cheese.  They all know how to make toast and grilled cheese <br/>
sandwiches.  I work outside the home on various evenings (I&#39;m a <br/>
Pampered Chef consultant - so yes; cooking is my life LOL!) and I do <br/>
many of the things that Deb suggested.  I make meals ahead of time, <br/>
have something that their dad can prepare, plan in a meal out or a <br/>
meal brought in.  <br/>
<br/>
And cooking is such a wonderful &quot;tool&quot; to enlightenment.  My kids <br/>
have looked up the history of spaghetti and how to grow pumpkins <br/>
just because of cooking.  The internet is a wonderful &quot;tool&quot; for <br/>
unschoolers because they can easily allow children to go from <br/>
one &quot;tangent&quot; to another.  They start looking up the history of <br/>
spaghetti and that leads them to a website about Italy which leads <br/>
them to a website about the Medici family which leads them to a <br/>
website about the plague in Europe which leads them to a website <br/>
about France which leads them to the History Channel and voila!  The <br/>
kids are in front of the television watching a show about the French <br/>
Revolution!  All because we decided to have spaghetti for dinner.  :-<br/>
