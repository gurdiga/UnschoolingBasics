  Small world!  My DH also grew up in Anaconda! :)  (Mike Holmlund, class of &#39;84, maybe you know him or his older sisters?)<br/>
   <br/>
  When Mike tried to explain to his oldest sister and his mom a bit about unconditional parenting, and especially that we are planning not to ever spank Jake, they both became very concerned.  (It all came up because they were giving him advice on how to handle Jake&#39;s first tantrums.)  His sister even lectured him for a half an hour about how Jake&#39;s going to take advantage of us and end up like her friend&#39;s son who is inconsiderate of everyone and smokes pot in the house at 17 because they never controlled him.  (Which is now a great joke between Mike and I -- whenever we let Jake do something we know would freak out his family out we laugh and say, &quot;You know, he&#39;s gonna be smokin&#39; pot in the house at 17!  Which now that Jake&#39;s 20 months and understanding lots more of what we say, we might have to quit saying that. ;)<br/>
   <br/>
  So of course when Mike mentioned to them that we plan on homeschooling that didn&#39;t go over very well either.  I can&#39;t quite imagine getting into the whole radical unschooling thing with them!<br/>
   <br/>
  It&#39;s funny because they are some of the kindest, generally open minded, non-judgemental people I know and I&#39;m very blessed to have such great in-laws.  But the &quot;rough and tough&quot; mining culture is still very much alive and well in Anaconda, and I was a surprised at how much they still buy into the idea that physical punishment is necessary for &quot;control&quot;.<br/>
   <br/>
  Even Mike is having hard a time letting go of the idea that Jake will be a &quot;freak&quot; because he will be homeschooled.  Socialization is the only aspect of the whole &quot;RU&quot; thing he frets about at all.<br/>
   <br/>
  The great thing about the difficult discussions he had with his family was that it sparked lots of great discussions between he and I about why we&#39;re making the parenting choices we are and how we want to break the chain of violence, guilt, control, etc.<br/>
   <br/>
  We plan on settling in Spokane (move in progress from the UK!), and I&#39;m hoping that the community there is much more accepting!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1396203421">It&#39;s a very small world!!!  Especially since I am all the way in SC and you are in the UK, but your husband and I grew up in the same small town.<br/>
   <br/>
  I graduated in 87.  I was Kelly Gilluly then, and my brother is Shaun Gilluly....he graduated in 84 with your hubby.  He lives in Idaho now with his wife, and 4 fur babies/no kids.  The name Holmlund sounds so familiar, but I have not lived there for so long that names/faces are fading from my memory.  My Mother (who still works up at the Anaconda/Deer Lodge County Courthouse) is always saying to me &quot;remember so and so&quot; and I tell her no, sorry Mom I have not lived in Anaconda in 20 years.  And you pegged the &quot;rough and tough&quot; mining culture right on.  Ask your husband how many of his High School buddies are still sitting on the same bar stools at the local bars in Anaconda......that should get a laugh out of him.  It&#39;s a joke with my father and I that a lot the people I went to high school with are still sitting on the same bar stools.  My husband and I just moved here to SC about 11 months ago from NJ.  My husband grew up in NJ and I was there for 12 years.  The first<br/>
 time I brought my husband to Montana was about 10 years ago.  It was such an experience for my husband.  New Jersey and Montana are two completely different worlds.  But I love my Montana Heritage.  I could not live there now though...........too cold!!!<br/>
   <br/>
  My family has actually been very supporting of us homeschooling our daughter&#39;s ages 7 & 8.  I think my Mom sees the things that go on at the Anaconda High School, and well that&#39;s enough for her to think that Homeschooling is the right thing to do.   And like I&#39;ve said my father is a liberal nut, and he totally get&#39;s it.  My brother has lots of friends that homeschool their kids so he thinks it&#39;s great.  It&#39;s my hubby&#39;s family that is extremely anti-homeschooling and they just can&#39;t grasp that their are other ways to raise children other than the traditional way.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Julie, are you also from Montana?  Spokane is a great area.  Good Luck with the move.<br/>
