somehow been caught up in this one... watch out also for subject <br/>
line &quot;new graphics site&quot; with attachment... it&#39;s the same <br/>
virus/spam/bad email.  :)<br/>

It&#39;s a groups thing.  Lots of members of yahoo groups are getting hit.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And the virus is actually at yahoogroups, not our computers (unless<br/>
you open the e-mails and get infected, but then the messages will go<br/>
directly to your personal contacts as well as any groups you have in<br/>
your contacts.)<br/>
<br/>
I have to say that the people who create these viruses are geniuses!<br/>
I&#39;m serious.  Dan said that it isn&#39;t the easiest thing to build these<br/>
kinds of worms because you really have to know your way around the<br/>
operating systems, know where the weaknesses are and how to make the<br/>
worm adapt - learn - as it is passed.  He frequents different<br/>
programming boards since he is a programmer and he has to learn how to<br/>
safeguard his work computers from these type of worms.  It is well<br/>
known in the programming world that one way to bypass required<br/>
education is to build a successful worm or virus, get arrested for it<br/>
and get it known that you did it.  Why?  Because when you have paid<br/>
your fine or served your time someone is going to be waiting for you<br/>
with a job offer.  Those that build the virus today are those that are<br/>
building virus protection tomorrow.  There have even been a few cases<br/>
where companies have helped a programmer plead out and get a reduced<br/>
sentence and part of his &quot;punishment&quot; is having a job!<br/>
