<div id="ygrps-yiv-1897699957">I don&#39;t think I was NEARLY as difficult as Kelly remembers..but, I <br/>
struggled the hardest with the whole chore and television issue.<br/>
<br/>
The education part was no big deal really, I &quot;got&quot; that back in <br/>
2000/2001. The chore and television issues were tough for me. Given <br/>
my background-raised in a cultish Christian church in which <br/>
television was viewed as evil-it&#39;s amazing I ever got it!!:)<br/>
<br/>
It was 2002 when I made the shift on the chore/television stuff. In <br/>
2001 I had lightened up a LOT about tv, but it really sunk in about <br/>
three years ago, thanks to Anne, Kelly, Joyce, Pam, Sandra, Rue, Deb <br/>
and many other beautiful voices.<br/>
<br/>
I have archived a few of my own posts about the chore issue, but <br/>
unfortunately, the tv ones got deleted somehow. I can&#39;t find them at <br/>
unschooling.com either. I DID post them before, I believe at AL or <br/>
UD, but it would be a major pain to find them in the archives.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t so negative about it, I simply agreed to disagree. I really <br/>
thought I was right.....but also thought these ladies were onto <br/>
something.<br/>
Turns out they were.;)<br/>

It was always fun!<br/>
