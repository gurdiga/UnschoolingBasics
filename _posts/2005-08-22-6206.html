<div id="ygrps-yiv-926041353">**I do have to interject, as I&#39;ve seen reference to this in a number of <br/>
posts, Christianity does NOT equal spanking.  People of all walks of <br/>
life and belief systems spank, beat their wives, kick their dogs, and <br/>
whatever horrendous forms of abuse can be dreamed up.  I&#39;m not sure <br/>
why it&#39;s needed to state that the abuser is a Christian.  It seems <br/>
irrelivant what faith the *abuser* may or may not be.**<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s relevant because there are numerous books, parenting speakers, <br/>
homeschooling workshops, and online seminars on the topic, all earnestly proclaiming <br/>
the message that it is the solemn duty of Christian parents to spank their kids, <br/>
for the salvation of their eternal souls. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not hard to find. And it&#39;s positively rampant in homeschooling circles.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-721687735">It&#39;s too bad you think that. I do believe you that there are many <br/>
books that do advocate spanking under the guise of &quot;Christianity&quot; <br/>
however I do not believe they state or certainly should not state<br/>
that <br/>
it saves their soul from hell and secondly it should not be<br/>
considered <br/>
a conclusive look at Christianity as a whole. <br/>
The phrase &quot;spare the rod&quot; must be put into context. Yes, it is <br/>
regarding discipline however it most certainly has nothing to do with <br/>
salvation. Remeber it is being written in a time and to a people who <br/>
probably used rods to disipline so we must always consider when and<br/>
to <br/>
whom these things were first written so we may consider the <br/>
context. &quot;Context is key&quot;! But on the subject of spanking, I am a <br/>
Christian who does spank but as little as possible. I do not believe <br/>
it to be something I must do biblically but I do believe what God is <br/>
trying to tell us in that verse is to be parents, to discipline our <br/>
children when they need it, thus &quot;training them&quot; to be decent, <br/>
productive citizens as well as training them in the ways of God by <br/>
sound consistent biblical teaching</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-608506915">To be perfectly honest, I don&#39;t have a solid answer for you. I do not <br/>
know any orthodox Jews (orthodox meaning living strickly by the law, <br/>
which is what the old testament is, law; the new testament is grace). <br/>
I have an opinion and please let it be well noted that this is my <br/>
opinion and not fact and I am not proposing it to be so. My opinion <br/>
is that Christianity is meant to be evangalistic. That is to say that <br/>
Christians who earnestly believe that Christ died for everyones sin, <br/>
and belief in Him is the only way to heaven; we can not work our way <br/>
there or ever be good enough to earn it, believe that they should <br/>
share that with everyone. The different way people go about doing <br/>
that is not always right, Christian like or kind, and for that I <br/>
apologize but fundamentaly that is what Christians are asked by <br/>
Christ to do, share the good news of the Gospel. Jews are not <br/>
evangalistic, they do not believe that Christ was the messiah and so <br/>
therefore there is no need to bring anyone to their faith. As I said <br/>
before, many &quot;Christians&quot; go about &quot;evangalizing&quot; all the wrong ways <br/>
and therby give the rest of us a very bad name but in my opinion that <br/>
is why you probably hear more about what Christians believe on <br/>
different subjects than you do Jewish people. <br/>
<br/>
I would really like to share one thing though while we are on the <br/>
subject of spanking children and it&#39;s relationship to Christianity <br/>
and God. It is also said in the bible, &quot;And you fathers, do not <br/>
provoke your children anger...&quot; Eph 6:4 (New Testament) This is the <br/>
apostle Pauls&#39; advice to fathers emphasizing patience. In this verse <br/>
Jesus describes, just as the heavenly Father, loves unconditionally, <br/>
forgives, without strings attached, and gives abundatly, so should <br/>
we  as earthly fathers (and mothers). If a parent is spanking out of <br/>
anger they are provoking their children to anger and that is not <br/>
biblical and not what God is asking of in the previously mentioned <br/>
scripture, &quot;spare the rod&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
Jewish parents can spank their kids, but most religious parents I know<br/>
don&#39;t spank and are counseled not to.  <br/>
It&#39;s forbidden to spank a grown child, a child thirteen or older, and if<br/>
your child is younger than that but as mature as a thirteen year old he<br/>
must not be hit.  Parents are required to consider the child&#39;s nature,<br/>

his dignity and therefor not be a useful tool of discipline.   A parent<br/>
who hits a child who then hits back is a stumbling block to that child. <br/>
Effectively the parent has *caused* the child to stumble morally and that<br/>
is morally unacceptable behavior on the parents part. <br/>
<br/>
A parent is also forbidden to be overly demanding of a child.  The idea<br/>
is not to make the respect due a parent a &quot;burdensome yoke&quot; to a child<br/>
because in doing so a parent will cause a child to stumble. ( in not<br/>
giving his parents their due respect)<br/>
<br/>
If the child is not behaving well, the parent is urged to consider<br/>
whether he/she is parenting well.  So parents are urged to be very<br/>
mindful and because of this I think spanking is rare, especially now as<br/>
society as a whole is questioning the ethics of spanking. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1904775270">Speaking of &quot;rods&quot; I&#39;m married to one.       :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been a strong supporter of BOTH sides of this issue.  Of course, as a<br/>
child, I opposed spanking.  When I had my first child I thought I should<br/>
spank, it&#39;s all I knew.  I sat through education classes thinking my<br/>
professors were just ignorant as they talked about &#39;alternatives to<br/>
spanking.&#39;  But, after I had my other children spanking never was something<br/>
that I had to use.  My daughter, for example, doesn&#39;t even like to know that<br/>
I am upset with her - it breaks her heart.  Can you imagine how she would<br/>
react to a spanking?  All children are different, I know.  But, looking back<br/>
at WHY I spanked my son, it was usually for things he eventually outgrew.<br/>
That&#39;s very very sad to me as I look back, but many of his &quot;discipline&quot;<br/>
problems were really just because he was not mature.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read that God uses a &quot;rod of reproof&quot; or &quot;rod of discipline&quot; with us?<br/>
But, I&#39;ve never been physically hit.  <br/>
<br/>
I think of a shepherd&#39;s rod or staff, did the shepherd ever beat the sheep?<br/>
I picture them guiding and not striking or &quot;striping.&quot;  I would also like to<br/>
know the exact context and the original Hebrew words to get more insight<br/>
into this scripture that is quoted as a reason to spank.  I am sure that if<br/>
you studied it more and in context, it wouldn&#39;t be properly used to support<br/>
spanking of small children.  Children are children - how many times do they<br/>
act the way they act because they are tired - frustrated?  You have to ask<br/>
if the child is acting out because of a discipline problem or are they<br/>
acting out because of their immaturity?  And saying, &quot;NO&quot; is not bad.<br/>
<br/>
I hope no one ever makes it common place to use the bible as an excuse to do<br/>
violence - using the bible to back up violent acts?  Would that make those<br/>
Christians &quot;Osama Christians?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I like the quote, &quot;Preach the gospel at all times, use words when<br/>
necessary.&quot;  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>6 different religious leaders (Presbyterian, Jewish, Buddhist, Hindu,  <br/>
Muslim and Southern Baptist) were asked &quot;According to your religious  <br/>
tradition, under what circumstances can a parent strike a child? How  <br/>
far can a parent go when correcting a child&#39;s behavior?&quot;<br/>

<br/>
In summary (though the whole article isn&#39;t that long and is very  <br/>
enlightening :-):<br/>
<br/>
The Presbyterian minister says: &quot;&#39;He who spares his rod hates his  <br/>
son&quot; was never meant as an endorsement of corporal punishment.&#39; ...  <br/>
Consistent, predictable, non-violent discipline is what children need  <br/>
-- not spankings.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The rabbi (? or some Jewish learned person) basically says Corporal  <br/>
punish can be part of discipline but ... and points to verses that  <br/>
offer better options.<br/>
<br/>
The Buddhist priest: &quot;I can only speak from the perspective of a  <br/>
simple Buddhist priest. Working over the years with my own children,  <br/>
students, prisoners, and my fellow human beings, I have learned that  <br/>
any form of punishment, be it corporal or psychological, is  <br/>
counterproductive. It is uncivilized and serves no purpose other than  <br/>
to perpetuate oppression.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(In fact most of his response fits into the philosophy of unschooling  <br/>
and parenting :-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Th Hindu says: &quot;Corporal punishment is violence, and it is not  <br/>
sanctioned by Hindu tradition or scriptures. Spanking teaches  <br/>
children that violence is acceptable.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(His response is even more in keeping with unschooling and parenting :-)<br/>
<br/>
The Muslim says: &quot;Islam teaches that children are a gift from God to  <br/>
parents. Our faith teaches parents to take good care of children and  <br/>
to show patience toward them.&quot; (Though he says after a list of much  <br/>
better ideas a light spanking is &quot;permitted to protect a child from a  <br/>
dangerous situation,&quot; and how to do it appropriately.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Southern Baptist says: &quot;According to my religious conviction, not  <br/>
tradition, I believe that spanking is appropriate only when a child  <br/>
(typically from 2 to 12 years of age) defies parental authority. In  <br/>
this case, the parent is biblically authorized and mandated to spank  <br/>
the child.&quot; (Though he then goes onto say use other ways first and  <br/>
how to spank appropriately.)<br/>
