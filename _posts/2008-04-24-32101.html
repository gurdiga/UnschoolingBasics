<div id="ygrps-yiv-1711537439">My 6 yr old&#39;s two favorite potions are vinegar and baking soda<br/>
(anything that explodes, overflows and makes a mess will do as well! )<br/>
 and water and cornstarch.... the water and cornstarch has so many<br/>
cool properties... it behaves like quicksand meaning that if you just<br/>
stir it around it&#39;s liquid but if you smack it or push down it becomes<br/>
very solid.... you can take a handful and squeeze out the liquid until<br/>
it&#39;s grainy in your hand then let go and it becomes liquid again and<br/>
oozes back into the bowl.   We love Steve Spangler Science... you can<br/>
watch lots of his videos on his website ... also go to the Ellen Show<br/>
website and look for Steve Spangler because he goes on her show<br/>
frequently.   He even did a bathtub full of water and cornstarch and<br/>
had an audience member &quot;walk&quot; on water!  It was really cool!<br/>

the glycerin out of the child&#39;s mouth though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-150717884">I think keeping a variety of materials available is a great way to<br/>
inspire new potions. Your kids will come up with their own very easily!:)<br/>
<br/>
We have also enjoyed the book &quot;Lotions, Potions and Slime; Mudpies and<br/>
More&quot; and another favorite which has all sorts of clays and homemade<br/>
goop titled &quot;Magic Mixtures&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The best thing though? Keep blowing bubbles, sidewalk chalk, cheap<br/>
flour and salt, baking soda and vinegar, cornstarch and other<br/>
fun-to-experiment-with substances. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-433316078">i enjoyed that link Ren thanks for posting it :)<br/>
i also like the book you mentioned alogn with other nancy blakely (is  <br/>
that her name?) stuff also<br/>
<br/>
our 6 yr dd is really into potions ï¿½ she uses flour and food coloring  <br/>
as her standard base then its anything after that. Actually when she  <br/>
was 4 she once turned to me after we watched a cooking show and said  <br/>
in shock, &quot;you mean people eat food coloring!?!&quot; because she thought  <br/>
it was solely for potions.<br/>
<br/>
Her other additions tend to be herbs, spices, bits of leaves, dirt,  <br/>
glitter and ... well ... anything. Our mortar and pestle are broken  <br/>
but i she really enjoyed that as part of the process at the time (it  <br/>
made almost anything potential potion ingredients).<br/>
<br/>
actually dd went through a period of rolling up her creations in  <br/>
tissue paper then selling them as &quot;smell balls&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
She would sit outside our house and yell &quot;get your smell balls  <br/>
here!&quot;. We moved since she was doing this last year but at the time  <br/>
our house faced onto a deserted lane way. The first time i waited 10  <br/>
minutes with her before going inside. Another 20 minutes later she  <br/>
came in having sold three smell balls ( a dollar each) to perhaps the  <br/>
only three people to walk down the lane way the entire day  :)<br/>
<br/>
for now she has gone back to more basic potions so her short lived  <br/>
business has been put on hold.<br/>

That is SO cute!! I bet the dollar those fortunate people spent, was<br/>
MORE than worth it. That would make my whole day to see a kiddo<br/>
selling &quot;smell balls&quot;.:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-93201852">Thank you so much, Ren and the others that replied. Sometimes I think I have thought about everything and then the easiest things don&#39;t come to mind. You gave me the idea of just buying a bunch of cheap supplies and I will set up a place for him where he can access and play with his own potions stuff. He went with me and we had a lot of fun. They do play outside for hours, the other day they made an Ooguu factory in an old plastic sandbox using anything they could find in the yard mixed with water then putting it in different size containers for sale. We do a lot of the flour, cornstarch etc. things in the house. Flubber is his current favorite, including the movie. I will certainly check out those books -<br/>
I loved the pictures of you chalk potion - I like to visit your website frequently with a good cup of tea and sometimes some truffles as well ;-)<br/>
