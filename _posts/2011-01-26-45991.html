<div id="ygrps-yiv-958925842">My oldest in, almost 4, has beautiful curls and never had a haircut. Her curls hang in her face, i think its cute and she doesn&#39;t mind at all, in fact if i suggest a hairclip or a ponytail she refuses the offer; she wipes her hands trough the curls, out of her face and tell&#39;s me that works just fine. I love it, it&#39;s so who she is. <br/>
<br/>
BUT....ah, the mother in law ;) She want&#39;s her to be a real girly-girl even though she&#39;s a tomboy. Every time she went over there she comes back with perfect girly hair; clips, pins, ponytails..... It&#39;s cute but so not her so to be honest it annoys me to bits. A couple of days she picked her up for a sleepover and my mother-in-law told me what to pack; that one girly dress (she doesn&#39;t like to wear) and a couple of hairpins. If i don&#39;t, she end&#39;s up buying new stuff like that every time she&#39;s there..<br/>
<br/>
My question is; my girl doesn&#39;t like her hair brushed and i&#39;m fine with that, the curls are cute anyway and it takes 3 days to mess them up, by then it&#39;s time to wash it again. No problem.<br/>
No pins, ponytails or girly-girl dresses if she doesn&#39;t want to. But how do i react to the pushing my MIL does? Now i just let her, thinking oh well, it&#39;s a grandma thing and my daughter knowsit. But it&#39;s quite stupid when i think about it, why should my daughter be a totally different kid when she is there, just because grandma likes to dress her up and show her off...?<br/>
<br/>
Any thought or advices?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The important question is how does your daughter feel about it? It may be that she sees playing the girl game as a condition of spending time with grandma and is okay with that. Does she otherwise enjoy going over? Does she have the freedom to leave at any time, or to say &quot;no I don&#39;t want to go&quot; at the last minute? If she&#39;s not being pushed or guilted into spending time with her grandma, then their relationship is theirs, not for you to decide. <br/>
<br/>
Its common for people to put on different roles in different situations, including different clothes and hairdos. In the alternative community of which I&#39;m a part, we talk about that in terms of &quot;drag&quot; (think Drag Queen). Nature is naked, and everything else is drag, as the saying goes. So your girl can have home drag, grandma&#39;s house drag, going to the playground drag, going to church drag... Do you see what I mean? She can be a tomboy sometimes and a girly-girl at others without being less herself. I certainly am both those things at different times, and sometimes at the *same* time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1343715774">Have you asked your daughter?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
She may enjoy doing it with her grandmother---and no one else. It may be their &quot;special time.&quot; It&#39;s amazing what we&#39;ll put up with to spend time with someone we love.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If my daughter hated it and didn&#39;t want to go, I would tell grandma that she won&#39;t be visiting again unless there will be no more dress up.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Does she come home crying and unhappy about the new do&#39;s?<br/>

<br/>
There are certainly plenty of messages to that point in the world, but as her mom, you have a lot of power in that regard, too. Do You only tell her she&#39;s pretty when her hair is done and she&#39;s wearing a dress or at other times? Do you Only say &quot;pretty&quot; about her dos and dresses or do you say &quot;looks like you had fun&quot; or some other &quot;neutral&quot; comment, like... &quot;Ooooh, glitter!&quot;?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1270853648">&quot;although i don&#39;t realy like it&quot; is all about you. Even at 4 it is important to <br/>
recognise that this is her relationship with her grandmother, your mother in law <br/>
(with whom there may be other issues), and not yours.<br/>
<br/>
 Linnaea and Simon will both be kinder and more engaged by their grandmother <br/>
without having to work at it like I do. They are able to listen and chat with <br/>
her when I would find myself struggling. It isn&#39;t their lack or her lack, it is <br/>
mine. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Your daughter going over and playing dress up with her grandmother is really <br/>
sweet. As long as she&#39;s enjoying it, as long as it is pleasure and good and fun <br/>
and the twirling gets her happy and the time is wonderful. Think of the memories <br/>
she is making. Think of the sweetness she&#39;ll feel when she thinks of playing <br/>
with her grandmother when she was a little girl. Those are hers, too. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1793333077">When I ask her if she wants a hairclip she says no because she doesn&#39;t like the feeling. So i guess that&#39;s why I don&#39;t really like it if her grandmother just puts them in without asking her. But that&#39;s my MY problem as pointed out, i think that&#39;s true because n the other hand, she really seems to understand it&#39;s a thing grandma does, just like eating fishfingers; loves them there, hates them at home. <br/>
<br/>
I always giving her compliments, lots and lots of them. She is beautiful no matter what, if she&#39;s wearing what she picked herself or if it&#39;s a more grandmothery outfit. I just don&#39;t care about that stuff in a girly manor so may be it&#39;s even a nice thing for her to have a grandparent who does :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</div>
