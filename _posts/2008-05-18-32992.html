<div id="ygrps-yiv-86061101">i&#39;d love to know how you would have handled the crayon <br/>
situation...even if i don&#39;t agree with the input, i could use a fresh <br/>
perspective and see if there&#39;s anything i can glean from it. i need <br/>
to find a new way of looking at things.<br/>

Maybe: Wow, looks like we need some new crayons. We&#39;ll have to get some new ones the next time we are at the store. Maybe a big box we can all share. In the meantime, do you want to do something different?<br/>

Hard to manage while everyone is yelling though. And I completely relate about the heat -- it&#39;s in the 90s here in FL already. The visiting 2-year-old spends a lot of time with the hose. :)<br/>
