<div id="ygrps-yiv-1498215206">The homepage my browser is set to is Abraham-Hicks<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.abraham-hicks.com/)">http://www.abraham-hicks.com/)</a>. There&#39;s something about seeing those<br/>
mountains and reading &quot;You are loved. All is well.&quot; that helps center<br/>
me. There&#39;s a different quote every day. You can sign up to get the<br/>
quotes by e-mail, too, but I like seeing those mountains. Today&#39;s<br/>
quote is:<br/>
<br/>
The children desire freedom! And every particle of their being from<br/>
their Source says, &quot;You are free. You are so free, that every thought<br/>
you offer, the entire Universe jumps to respond to it.&quot; And so, to<br/>
take that kind of knowledge and try to confine it in any way, defies<br/>
the Laws of the Universe. You must allow your children to be free,<br/>
because the entire Universe is set up to accommodate that. And<br/>
anything you do to the contrary will only bring you regret. You cannot<br/>
contain those that cannot be contained. It defies Law.  --- Abraham<br/>

Nice to know I&#39;m flowing *with* the Universe. I can feel it!<br/>
