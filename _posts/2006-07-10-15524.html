Yes, but folks that are newer to unschooling, or just trying to get an<br/>
understanding might be best to try and see those connections themselves.<br/>
<br/>
I DO ensure my kids get all of that, but not for the sake of teaching<br/>
them anything, but because we ALL share connections with each other<br/>
all the time. The connections are great to share. It&#39;s how and why<br/>
we&#39;re doing it that affect the relationship.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Undoubtedly because they&#39;ve developed the habit of making  <br/>
connections, expanding their world. BUT - without us to be providers  <br/>
of new ideas, resources, connections, etc., their world would be a  <br/>
lot smaller. I think it IS our role, as unschooling parents, to  <br/>
&quot;ensure&quot; that our kids are living a lifestyle, with all that  <br/>
encompasses, which provides them ample opportunities to expand their  <br/>
horizons in a zillion ways - including helping them make connections  <br/>
to other things, from the things they are already into.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And they need to understand that unschooling parents are really NOT  <br/>
ignoring their kids. When they see my kid playing videogames for 6  <br/>
hours a day, they might think that I&#39;m &quot;doing nothing.&quot; Not true. I&#39;m  <br/>
talking to them about the game, being interested so that they feel  <br/>
free to talk to ME about it, I&#39;m keeping my eyes out for connections  <br/>
that might interest them - movies, other games, books about the  <br/>
games, new items, game-playing opportunities, etc. I spend seemingly  <br/>
endless hours at the game store - I may not stay there with them for  <br/>
all those hours (I go off and have a cup of coffee and read a book or  <br/>
shop for myself) - but I spend SOME time there and I get to know the  <br/>
games and what they like about them and all that. AND - I support  <br/>
their energy, their focus. When we happen to drive by a game store  <br/>
and they want to go in, I don&#39;t groan - I say, &quot;Oh, cool. Yeah, let&#39;s  <br/>
go see what they&#39;ve got there.&quot; And, once inside, I might ask some  <br/>
questions - &quot;Oh, I haven&#39;t heard of that - what kind of game is  <br/>
that?&quot; &quot;Is that the type of game playing you&#39;re into right now?&quot; Or -  <br/>
I have shy kids, so I&#39;ll be the one to initiate a conversation with  <br/>
the guys/girls working in the game store - to break the ice - and  <br/>
then my kids will have fun talking to them about how this game plays  <br/>
and that game&#39;s weaknesses and so on.<br/>
<br/>
There is a lot of room for unschooling parents to support a child&#39;s  <br/>
interest in videogames - besides writing the checks &lt;G&gt;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So true. The professor makes it sound a little like parents ought to  <br/>
force something - videogame connection lessons &lt;G&gt; - having read  <br/>
other stuff he&#39;s written, I don&#39;t think that is what he meant by  <br/>
&quot;ensure.&quot; I think he means parents ought to support the interest and  <br/>
have conversations about it - not be telling the kid he&#39;s playing too  <br/>
much and to go do something more valuable, etc.<br/>
