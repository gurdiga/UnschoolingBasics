Here is some info from it:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ANNUAL HOMESCHOOL HIKE/BIKE EVENT<br/>
The homeschool hiking/biking annual event began in may 2005 as a way<br/>
to gain recognition for homeschooling as well as getting some<br/>
exercise, group involvement, and introducing homeschoolers and their<br/>
families to hiking and biking in the great outdoors!!<br/>
When?<br/>
It is an annual event now and will be held each year the last full<br/>
week in May all across the United States. We are asking for<br/>
individuals and groups involved in homeschooling to set up events in<br/>
their areas.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How do we get involved?<br/>
Your event may be as simple as putting a press release in the<br/>
newspaper to get all your homeschooling buddies together for a hike or<br/>
bike. You may make your event in varying skill levels if you would<br/>
like for homeschoolers with varying skills. Maybe one person or group<br/>
in your area can set up a hiking event and another can set up the<br/>
biking event. Or yous may want to work with many homeschooling groups<br/>
to have one big event. The possibilites are many, and I would love to<br/>
hear your ideas.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

site. Please feel free to download a copy of the press release to send<br/>
to your local newspaper by clicking on the press release link. Please<br/>
fill in your appropriate info in the spaces provided. If you would<br/>
like us to contact your local newspaper, please let us know and we<br/>
would be glad to send them the info. Just let us know the newspapers<br/>
name and phone number/email along with your info : Date, Time, place,<br/>
contact info. I would appreciate it if you would send some pictures to<br/>
us after your event so we may post them here on our site. You may want<br/>

Please enjoy your hike and bike event this year and stay tuned for<br/>
