It *isn&#39;t* easy to let go! It&#39;s scary! It takes some uncomfortable  <br/>
self examination to let go. But what you&#39;re seeing displayed on the  <br/>
list is the one balloon someone has decided to let go of. You&#39;re just <br/>
not seeing the other 11 balloons they&#39;re still holding onto ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It is very scary.  For me, making the decisions to &quot;try&quot; changes and for my <br/>
husband, watching us change.  He asks me every few days if I&#39;m afraid, scared, <br/>
etc.  He is more scared than we are because he&#39;s not on these support lists.  <br/>
<br/>
I admittedly have more than a dozen balloons still controlling our lives and <br/>
we are popping them one, sometimes two at a time.  What I&#39;ve learned as I <br/>
really allow ourselves to be free is that it is working for our family.  Really <br/>
working.  My kids are happier, I&#39;m happier, we&#39;re building trust (I didn&#39;t <br/>
realize I wasn&#39;t trusting them until I let go of the reigns), they&#39;re learning to <br/>
trust themselves, they&#39;re thinking more because they&#39;re thinking about what <br/>
they want to think and not what I was forcing them to try to think about.  Does <br/>
that make any sense?  It&#39;s not easy, but its getting easier as we learn to <br/>
trust ourselves and each other.  As time goes on I think the rest of our balloons <br/>
will probably set themselves free and we may not even see them go because this <br/>
freedom thing is becoming so natural.  I am also learning how to respect my <br/>
own issues without imposing them onto my children.  Cleaning for example, my <br/>
biggest issue.  I&#39;m dealing with messes and not yelling and feeling frustrated <br/>
about it.  Most of the time.  I really like the thought of cleaning as a <br/>
choice.  It is a choice.  I am going to choose not to clean today--Thank you Joyce!<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my question for the day:  How do you seasoned unschoolers handle <br/>
sibling rivalry, your kids fighting, irritating each other, etc?  I&#39;ve come to an <br/>
unhappy place in this area where I just don&#39;t want to hear my kids mistreating <br/>
each other so I frequently tell them to go fight away from me.  That is really <br/>
not what I want I just want them to quit bickering.  It hurts me to hear them <br/>
hurt each other.  Any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
Robin, feeling like I&#39;m in therapy when I read these helpful posts.  Thanks <br/>
for all the tangible advice and help ladies!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I feel your pain! &lt;BEG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I let this get to me, a lot, too. My kids got along pretty well when  <br/>
they were young - they enjoyed each other and worked things out and  <br/>
had fun together pretty much all the time. So when they hit the teen  <br/>
years and started having more conflicts, I was unprepared for it,  <br/>
myself, and took it very personally - as it says, above, &quot;It hurts me  <br/>
to hear them hurt each other.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I handled it badly and made it worse in SPITE of intellectually  <br/>
knowing better ways. I complained, nagged, whined, and on and on - I  <br/>
begged them to stop FOR MY SAKE!<br/>
<br/>
Finally, Rosie and Roxana told me I was making it worse, that I was  <br/>
making a big deal out of what, to them, was just a disagreement and  <br/>
that even if they got mad at each other, it would blow over faster if  <br/>
I&#39;d stop putting MY energy into it, too, and making it seem like they  <br/>
were doing something to ME.<br/>
<br/>
I thought about it and realized that they have perfectly good problem  <br/>
solving skills and that they don&#39;t any longer need me to intervene.  <br/>
The time for that direct approach has passed, for us. I&#39;ll still help  <br/>
clarify if I think one is misunderstanding the other - or I&#39;ll offer  <br/>
to help if there is something I can do (like I can say, &quot;You could go  <br/>
use my bathroom,&quot; if they are having trouble sharing their bathroom).  <br/>
But I&#39;ve stopped trying to stop THEM from having conflicts and I&#39;ve  <br/>
stopped taking it personally when they hurt each other&#39;s feelings.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids were younger, I&#39;d read &quot;Siblings Without Rivalry,&quot; and  <br/>
put it into practice - I think it was wonderful and was really the  <br/>
reason my kids mostly got along and enjoyed each other.<br/>
<br/>
Also - I had to accept that a certain amount of &quot;not getting along&quot;  <br/>
was really all right - it didn&#39;t mean they hated each other. And, I  <br/>
had to let go of the idea that they&#39;d always be &quot;best friends.&quot; I  <br/>
changed my perspective so that, instead of being upset when they are  <br/>
NOT being close and loving with each other, I am grateful and happy  <br/>
when they ARE sweet and friendly with each other. And, at 15, 18, and  <br/>
21, they still like each other and still WANT to hang out together -  <br/>
they&#39;re proud of each other, BUT they still, in fact, have conflicts  <br/>
and sometimes say things to each other that hurt MY feelings.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-246921857">Pam&#39;s is a great response.... my sister and I are only 22 months apart and<br/>
because of birthdays, were only  a year apart in school... growing up we<br/>
were the best of friends and the worst of enemies.<br/>
<br/>
my mom very rarely butted in to our arguments... most of the time she&#39;d just<br/>
yell from the other room &quot;girls, quit your bickering!&quot;  when we were very<br/>
young, our parents would always make us &quot;kiss and make up&quot;... they&#39;d always<br/>
tell us &quot;don&#39;t go away mad, just go away&quot;... not always the best way to<br/>
handle things but certainly not the worst, I figured they did the best with<br/>
what they knew, since they both grew up with many siblings.<br/>
<br/>
I can tell you that I remember the last fight my sister and I got into... I<br/>
d say we were probably about 14 or 15... and I for the life of me can&#39;t<br/>
remember what the fight was about but it escalated to the point of one of us<br/>
picking up a doll rocking chair and hurling it down the hall at the other...<br/>
and all of a sudden it seemed to shock us back into reality, and we both<br/>
stopped and looked at each other, and just busted up laughing because we<br/>
realized that what we were doing was ridiculous and we couldn&#39;t even<br/>
remember what we were fighting about.<br/>
<br/>
we are very good friends now... it helps to have one other person in the<br/>
world that &quot;really knows&quot; just how messed up your parents and other family<br/>
members really are... lol... and who I have that history with and we have a<br/>
lot in common... like natural health, arts and crafts, similar parenting<br/>
styles, and the same peer group when we were in high school.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d just say to walk a fine line between how much involvement you put<br/>
yourself into your children&#39;s disagreements.  It is ok to let them work<br/>
things out on there own... and to let them know that if they need a mediator<br/>
that you are there to help them.  Even siblings... with similar genetics...<br/>
can have totally different personalities... and it&#39;s expected that they won<br/>
t always get along.<br/>

&gt; fighting, irritating each other, etc?<br/>
&gt; Robin<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi Robin,<br/>
<br/>
I do not consider myself a seasoned unschooler, but I am a mother to <br/>
3 children, ages 8, 9 and 14.  My oldest has only been with us <br/>
weekends and holidays due to a shared custody arrangement so I <br/>
haven&#39;t had the same type of fighting issues with her that I&#39;ve seen <br/>
in my younger two children.  My younger 2 are only 20 months apart <br/>
and are each other&#39;s main playmates.  My ds9 is an introvert who <br/>
likes being alone a lot of time.  My dd8 is an extrovert who likes <br/>
being with people nearly all of the time.  Their personalities have <br/>
made for some interesting clashes.<br/>
<br/>
I do not like the parenting theory that allows children to continue <br/>
fighting to work it out themselves.  If they had the ability to work <br/>
it out, they wouldn&#39;t be fighting.  I don&#39;t think they necessarily <br/>
have the experience and tools to find a peaceful resolution without <br/>
any outside assistance.  Now, sometimes they do work it out.  I&#39;m <br/>
also sure they have more disagreements than I see.  I step in when I <br/>
see their spirits breaking.  Even my DH and I have disagreements, <br/>
but when one of us is really hurting, we can sort of put the <br/>
disagreement to the side and reconnect emotionally because our love <br/>
is greater than our hurts.  But my kids don&#39;t have that feeling.  <br/>
Sometimes their fighting sparks the &#39;fight or flight&#39; mode and it&#39;s <br/>
just way intense.<br/>
<br/>
I also step in when I hear them doing what I call typical kid <br/>
disagreeing.  You know, the &#39;yes, no, yes, no, yes, no&#39; back and <br/>
forth type stuff that leads absolutely no where.  I always ask them <br/>
what&#39;s going on and give them both a chance to tell me what&#39;s going <br/>
on but instead of trying &quot;fix&quot; it, I usually hug, kiss and validate <br/>
and try to let them see the other&#39;s point of view.  Then I redirect <br/>
to something entirely different.  It seems much easier to send the <br/>
kids away, i.e. out of the room or out of the house, for peace and <br/>
quiet.  But part of our unschooling lifestyle is that I am a 100% <br/>
participant in their lives.  It means I might have to stop what I&#39;m <br/>
doing, put my laptop down, put my book down, stop cleaning, get off <br/>
the phone, etc.; but in those times especially, they need me there <br/>
with them.  We find something fun to do and our spirits become <br/>
joyful again.  Most always, they graduate into doing something <br/>
together and leave me out of the loop so that I find something to do <br/>
with myself.  Our days ebb and flow like this all day.<br/>

So true.  That&#39;s the kind of mother I am striving to be so thank you for the <br/>
reminder.  I will &quot;rewind&quot; and reconsider my responses if I feel the urge to <br/>
send them away again.  The hugging I always use with foster kids because it <br/>
almost always calms them down.  I expect too much from my tiny children in <br/>
expecting them to work things out at ages 9 and 6.  I&#39;ll get in the ring with them <br/>
next time and hug them and redirect them with kindness rather than frustration. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
Robin, who is truly enjoying this self examination as well as the dummy slaps <br/>
offered from people on this list.  I need them so keep them coming!<br/>
