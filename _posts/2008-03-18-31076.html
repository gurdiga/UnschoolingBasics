&gt; I think I know Dylan better than anyone else does, except for Dylan.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Lot&#39;s of people coming from a more traditional background though who think<br/>
&gt; they know what makes their kid tick, might think a melt down is because the<br/>
&gt; kid is selfish or spoiled or being a brat.  We read that here sometimes.  I<br/>

&gt; what to do....&quot; etc. ***<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is a difference if folks I guess because I didn&#39;t think &quot;I can&#39;t do<br/>
&gt; this&quot; I&#39;d think,  &quot;Now why in the HELL did I do THAT?&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ***I&#39;d say that makes you a perfect human being, flaws and all***<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Uh, no.&lt;g&gt;   I don&#39;t think understanding I&#39;ll never be perfect, in my<br/>
&gt; parenting or otherwise, is a negative thing.  I don&#39;t have a *need* to be<br/>
&gt; perfect.  I need to be thoughtful of my kid and analytical of my mistakes<br/>
&gt; and remember I *can* do better.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ***testament to your commitment to a lack of crappiness ***<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yes.  It&#39;s good to have a big balance in our relationship account, and to<br/>
&gt; continue to make a lot of regular deposits because when I make a little<br/>
&gt; withdrawal for some stupid reason, the balance is still way high.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ***I love that our life is without the constant turmoil of a<br/>
&gt; crappiness/insincere apology cycle in it (as in my childhood)***<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yes, this is important.  My dh at forty eight still struggles with some of<br/>
&gt; the turmoil of his childhood and our son at fifteen has little of that.<br/>
&gt; Dylan is already emotionally healthier and will be his whole life.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ***This was running through my<br/>
&gt; head as I baked tonight & I couldn&#39;t wait to come home and write :)***<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I enjoy your perspective even if you are more touchy/feely than I am.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; (Cyborgs are more touchy/feely than I am.&lt;g&gt;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is veering wildly off topic now but I have a couple recipes for dairy<br/>
&gt; free cake if you want them.  They might could stand some of your creative<br/>
&gt; tweaking.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
