 </span></blockquote>I let/help/make my kids (ds13, dd11) decide what is appropriate for them.  That&#39;s their job.  My job is to understand the things they do or don&#39;t like, and then find out if a particular movie or CD has that stuff in it.   I&#39;m just here to provide information.  They know better than I do what will make them scared or upset later.   Right now, they may start to watch a movie, and then leave if it is too intense, scary, sexy, boring, whatever.  We use the ratings on stuff not to say, &quot;Oh, this is R, your can&#39;t watch it.&quot;  We use the ratings to say, &quot;Oh, this is R, it will probably have stuff you would&#39;t want to see.&quot;  But they have a friend who loves scary movies, so her comfort level with an R movie would be different.  Right now, my kids don&#39;t even like to watch PG-13 movies!   <br/>
<br/>
I also try to allow for changing tastes, just like I do for food.   <br/>
<br/>
And modeling is always important.  If I avoid a movie or CD for whatever reason, I share that with my kids.  That gives them a little more information on how to make a decision--how to pay attention to how things feel to them.  I don&#39;t get to tell them what the &quot;right&quot; decision is, I just get to share with them how I go about reaching a decision for myself.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, I should recommend Parent/Teen Breakthrough: The Relationship Approach by Mira Kershenbaum and Charles Foster.  It gives excellent advice!  At least I have found it works really well around my house!  <br/>
