<div id="ygrps-yiv-1670422250">The Indian Creek Chronicles by Pete Fromm,<br/>
about a young man who spends a winter in the Selway.   He was so naive<br/>
and inexperienced it&#39;s almost unbelievable he survived but it&#39;s a good<br/>
story. <br/>

Here&#39;s another one about an inexperienced, naive young man who sets out on a <br/>
quest to live in the wilds of Alaska: &quot;Into The Wild&quot; by Jon Krakauer. <br/>
Nonfiction. VERY interesting story (I thought) but, with a very tragic ending. I read <br/>
it a couple years ago and my dd is reading it now. Not trying to be <br/>
discouraging or anything.  It&#39;s more of a *what not to do* kind of story when <br/>
attempting to live out in the wild. <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s from a well-to-do family, gives away $25,000 in savings to charity, <br/>
abandons his car and most of his possessions, burns all the cash in his wallet and <br/>
goes off to live in the wild. He was definitely not well prepared at all. At <br/>
one point he sees a plane over head and waves, with ONE hand, which is an <br/>
international signal that &quot;Hello. Everything is OK.&quot; He didn&#39;t even know to wave <br/>
*both* hands up in the air to signal distress so the plane moved on. <br/>
