<div id="ygrps-yiv-1771025620">Dayna Martin&#39;s book, &quot;Radical Unschooling - A Revolution Has Begun&quot;  <br/>
will be published in less than a month!!<br/>
<br/>
Dayna wrote this about her book:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The book is about Radical Unschooling philosophy and how I believe  <br/>
it is the evolution of parenting. I sprinkle personal stories and  <br/>
examples from our own life to share how kids do learn as a side  <br/>
effect of living a joyful life pursiing their passions.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
John Taylor Gatto wrote this about the book,<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Full of brilliant common sense! Mrs. Martin takes us behind the  <br/>
curtain to see in rich detail what alternative education really looks  <br/>
like when it bestows on its subjects the freedom to choose.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
